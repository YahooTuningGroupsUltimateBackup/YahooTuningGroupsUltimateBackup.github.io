My ear<br/>&gt; demands everything, Bach included, in 7-limit tuning.<br/>&gt; There, a tritone is something to be tuned, either as<br/>&gt; 7/5 or as 10/7, according to context.  In 5-limit, as<br/>&gt; I am slowly learning, a tritone is something to be<br/>&gt; subject to creative fudging, along with creative<br/>&gt; rationalizations about why it should be dissonant, yet<br/>&gt; we should still call this &quot;Just Intonation&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To reach an understanding of the beauty of 7-limit<br/>&gt; dynamic tuning, it is necessary to get past an intolerance<br/>&gt; for shifts of sub-comma and perhaps even an occasional<br/>&gt; super-comma step.  I am here to say that it IS possible<br/>&gt; to stretch one&apos;s ear&apos;s tolerance, and that the tradeoffs<br/>&gt; are well worth it, with a beauty that 5-limit falls far<br/>&gt; short of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would gladly leave 5-limit adaptive tuning to someone<br/>&gt; else, since I never listen to 5-limit unless there&apos;s some<br/>&gt; non-musical reason to do so.  In fact, I have often<br/>&gt; considered withdrawing the 5-limit versions of the pieces<br/>&gt; I tune, if for no other reason than because I generate them<br/>&gt; and post them without hearing them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, some people still like 5-limit tuning, for whatever<br/>&gt; reason, and it is fun to dabble in pleasing other people&apos;s<br/>&gt; taste.  And, as for leaving 5-limit tuning to others, so<br/>&gt; far no one has stepped up to the plate with more than the<br/>&gt; barest vaporware.</p><p>John,</p><p>I&apos;m stepping up to the plate just to argue some of the things<br/>you say here.  Of course, your own personal choices in tuning<br/>need no defense other than that that is what you like<br/>- there are lots of people who love 7-limit ratios.</p><p>And I completely agree that &apos;it IS possible to stretch<br/>one&apos;s ear&apos;s tolerance&apos;.</p><p>But I think you&apos;re off the mark when you say &apos;the tradeoffs<br/>are well worth it, with a beauty that 5-limit falls far short<br/>of&apos;.  Indeed, you don&apos;t even listen to the retuned 5-limit<br/>stuff you post, so what kind of authority do you have to<br/>make statements like that?</p><p>Don&apos;t forget that an extended 5-limit system can easily<br/>make use of the 225/224 &apos;bridge&apos;, treating 225/128 as a<br/>7/4 (which is only ~7.712 cents lower in pitch or narrower<br/>in interval size) while still exploiting its 5-limit<br/>relationships; or, for that matter, that in 7-limit<br/>music it can work the other way around, and the 7/4 can<br/>be treated as a 225/128.  I&apos;ve done exactly this in some<br/>of my own compostiions, and this is just one example from<br/>among many.</p><p>Given your small &apos;errors&apos; of a few cents in your Adaptive JI<br/>algorithm, I&apos;d think that you would be particularly interested<br/>in exploiting this kind of thing.</p><p>There&apos;s no reason to assume that 5-limit tuning is simplistic<br/>or that its possibilities have been exhausted - there&apos;s<br/>still plenty that&apos;s never been done, or even thought of.</p><p>Always on the lookout to confront dogmatic statements<br/>about tuning,<br/>:)</p><p>-monz</p><p>PS - I am in the last few days of finishing up a major<br/>paper on Aristoxenus.  As soon as I make it into a webpage,<br/>I&apos;ll post it here.  &apos;Stay tuned&apos;.</p><p>Joseph L.

John and I are using<br/>5-limit JI and 7-limit JI to refer _only_ to how the simultaneities are<br/>tuned; to the highest _odd_, not prime, number used in the simulataneous<br/>ratios; and we are allowing _any_ interval, rational or irrational, to<br/>appear between consecutive pitches.</p></div>
