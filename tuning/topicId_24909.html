Examples include<br/>&gt; the desire to make two identical sized intervals in melodic sequence the same size,<br/>&gt; wanting to raise a leading tone to make a stronger lead to the tonic.  Probably more<br/>&gt; importantly though, there are only so many sustained chords in real-world music, and<br/>&gt; when notes move by at normal speed, beatless consonance is a heck of a lot harder to<br/>&gt; even detect, much less prefer.  And of course vibrato complicates the question even<br/>&gt; further.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So when Brian gives you the impression that the JI concept is all a load of<br/>&gt; meaningless tripe, what he probably means is that it is audibly significant in<br/>&gt; sustained block chords, but as music departs from that pardigm, its meaningfulness<br/>&gt; rapidly gets overwhelmed by other tuning ideals.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=24910 href="#24910">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2001 5:15:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gary!<br/>   The context is a result of using such singular elements. not the other way around.

In examining world music<br/>&gt; , I have never seen this phenomenon.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This seems strange and completely backwards to me.</p><p>In other words</p><p>   1) JI (or near JI) is important for chords. A chord<br/>      (not in a functional sense but in an audible sense)<br/>      includes a melody sung against a drone, particularly<br/>      if that drone is a 3:2 dyad.</p><p>   2) An unaccompanied melodist in a non-resonant room<br/>      can be &apos;off&apos; by a large amount (including resultant<br/>      drift) and the pitch class vibe will be coming<br/>      through. In other words, the targets may be<br/>      interpreted as JI, however the execution will<br/>      be far off and tolerated.</p><p>   3) There are lots of cultures which deal with identical<br/>      step sizes as in Western diatonic, pythagorean tuning<br/>      of Eastern pentatonics, close approximate to 7-ET<br/>      used in other Asian countries.</p><p>   4) I&apos;m inclined to think that since the ear is a<br/>      logarithmic machine, low-number ETs may be easier<br/>      to &quot;grok&quot; psychoacoustically than medium high<br/>      RI type numbers (16/13, things in the range between<br/>      being tunable and being indistinquishable from<br/>      an &quot;out of tune lower valued JI&quot;</p><p>   5) There is a lot of expressive singing that doesn&apos;t<br/>      seem to match anything mathematic, whether JI<br/>      or otherwise. I tend to look at some of the bent<br/>      blues notes that way, (with no disrespect for Monz<br/>      RI analysis of said notes) and Gerald Eskelins<br/>      search for the high third may have been the same<br/>      (it seemed to be somewhere between 12ED2 and<br/>      pythagorean, but what and why?)</p><p>Not to start a fight but illuminate me on a few of these points.<br/>I find the &quot;E&quot; pocket to be huge, unless a &quot;C&quot; is sounding.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=24961 href="#24961">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2001 1:07:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BVAL@I... wrote:</p><p>&gt;    3) There are lots of cultures which deal with identical<br/>&gt;       step sizes as in Western diatonic, pythagorean tuning<br/>&gt;       of Eastern pentatonics, close approximate to 7-ET<br/>&gt;       used in other Asian countries.</p><p>. . . Middle Eastern modes which divide the minor third melodically<br/>into two perceptually equal parts, etc. etc. I&apos;ve worked with lots<br/>and lots of different microtonal scales, and it&apos;s very clear (to my<br/>compositional sense) that no matter how unfamiliar a particular<br/>melodic step will be, following it with another step of the same size<br/>has a &quot;congruence&quot; effect that you can hear, and use musically. This<br/>is one reason why MOS scales work so well -- the &quot;congruence&quot; is only<br/>broken at structurally important positions in the scale.</p><p>Caveat: the line between &quot;same&quot; and &quot;not same&quot; when it comes to step<br/>sizes is pretty gray. Even if there&apos;s a 35-cent difference, there&apos;s a<br/>bit of &quot;sameness&quot; there . . . and if there&apos;s only a 10-cent<br/>difference, there&apos;s a whole lot of &quot;sameness&quot; in the step sizes.</p></div>
