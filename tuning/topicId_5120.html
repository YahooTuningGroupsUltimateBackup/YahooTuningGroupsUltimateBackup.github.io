And what do they have to do with the type of<br/>periodicity blocks you&apos;re looking for?  Incidentally, by what reasoning did<br/>you figure that all periodicity blocks represent each of their acoustic<br/>intervals by only one scale position?</p><p>&gt;Therefore the Pythagorean diatonic scale, and myriad CSs based on it, are<br/>&gt;not strictly proper. The 2nd order MOSs and their CSs can be highly<br/>&gt;improper.</p><p>Paul, perhaps there is still confusion on what CS means.  From Kraig&apos;s most<br/>recent post, I took it to refer to MOS&apos;s that don&apos;t change as the generator<br/>size does, ie all 2-tone chains are MOS, the 7-tone chain of fifths is a CS<br/>of the 12, 19, and 31 tone chains of fifths...</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=5139 href="#5139">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Please refer<br/>to Kraig&apos;s Wilson Archives. However, the concept you mistakenly took CS to<br/>mean is interesting. Can you explain further?</p><p>&gt;Incidentally, by what reasoning did<br/>&gt;you figure that all periodicity blocks represent each of their acoustic<br/>&gt;intervals by only one scale position?</p><p>More intuition than reasoning. Can you find any counterexamples?</p></div>
