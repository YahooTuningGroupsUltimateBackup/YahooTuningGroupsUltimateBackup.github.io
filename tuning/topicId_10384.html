I have posted it on my website at<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/bmames.geo">http://www.geocities.com/bmames.geo</a>. It sounds much as you imagined it.  I<br/>use it to clear my computer room of children. I feel that, with a little<br/>work, it would make great background for a suspense movie.  Just as the<br/>killer bees attack...</p><p>I used 4000 iterations to settle to the attractor and then the lesser of 16<br/>or the period of the attractor for the values actually stored.  As you can<br/>see from the chaotic sequence, the process creates individual notes for each<br/>step.  I later combined sucessive notes where they were equal.  The staccato<br/>notes at the end of the first sequence posted are remnants of this<br/>combination process which I left because of the effect created.</p><p>The next challenge is to devise a method to resolve the apparent lines that<br/>run through the chaotic regions.  They are apparent to the eye and therefore<br/>should be able to be detected by the computer.  It would be interesting to<br/>know what a blind person makes of the result.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>&gt;   Date: Wed, 31 May 2000 09:09:28 -0400<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mtpepper@prodigy.net">mtpepper@prodigy.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: Re: Strange Attractors<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is most interesting. I have some experience with Verhulst dynamics, and<br/>&gt;though I&apos;ve seen the bifurcation plot many times, I&apos;ve never heard it. I&apos;m<br/>&gt;sure a blind person could visualize it if they heard this. It would be<br/>&gt;interesting to hear further along in one of the &quot;windows&quot; where the number<br/>&gt;of attractors turns suddenly from nearly infinite to, say, three. I think it<br/>&gt;would probably become more and more confused and dissonant until you almost<br/>&gt;couldn&apos;t stand it any more and then everything would suddenly be much<br/>&gt;simpler, if not exactly consonant (though I wonder...).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;How many iterations did you use? Or did you use some method that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;involve iterations? And what are those little pops in the middle, that sound<br/>&gt;like changing notes? And those extra staccato notes at the end?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Stay Tuned,<br/>&gt;    Keenan P.</p></div>
