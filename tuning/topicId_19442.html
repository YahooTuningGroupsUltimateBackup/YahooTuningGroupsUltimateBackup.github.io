So<br/>what.&quot;</p><p>Joseph:</p><p>Each writer is free to choose the style and format she wishes. I&apos;ll be the first<br/>to admit to a writing style full of eccentricities and prolix bad habits. I<br/>wouldn&apos;t want it any other way. However, the choice - and often I suspect that<br/>it is not a choice but rather plain laziness - of a radically unorthodox style<br/>comes with the risk that one cannot be understood. It is my assumption that<br/>everyone posting to the list has something important to say, and I don&apos;t want to<br/>miss a word. Unfortunately, if the text is rendered so casually that it can&apos;t be<br/>read by a second reader, and even by a native speaker, words will be missed and<br/>mistaken.</p><p>My second assumption was that others on the list respect and dignify music, so<br/>that when they speak or write about music it is done in a manner that shows<br/>respect and dignity. This is pure value judgement on my part, so I withdraw this<br/>with apologies.</p><p>Having recently moved to a new country, and one in which the local language was<br/>completely opaque, I have once again experienced myself slipping into the<br/>American conceit that if you speak loudly enough in broken English you will make<br/>yourself understood anywhere. Above and beyond the rudeness of the assumption,<br/>it just doesn&apos;t work that way. Non-native speakers do not converse in broken<br/>English, but attempt to understand and be understood in a form of standard<br/>English. People who have learned English in school do indeed learn an<br/>unnaturally correct form of the language, but one that is comprehensible. On the<br/>other hand, the casual usages of a native speaker go far beyond what can be<br/>learnt in school.</p><p>If this list were restricted to North America, I wouldn&apos;t bother with this<br/>complaint. What the hey, campers, you know, we could like do the whole enchilada<br/>in el-lay dialect.  Thataway, &apos;least Kraig&apos;n&apos;I&apos;d be happy campers.</p><p>Later dates dude,</p><p>DJW</p></div>
