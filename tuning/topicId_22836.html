So far there&apos;s only a small body of<br/>&gt; music for it (some of which you might hear on the 18th!).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Probably not me, but I hope many do hear it. (Are you performing<br/>in Israel?:)</p><p>&gt; &gt; I suspect that some of the<br/>&gt; &gt; meantone theory dealing with augmented<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals would be as close to a place<br/>&gt; &gt; to start as any.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s another approach, which is why I got the 31-tone guitar.

I guess you want<br/>to have all the consonant intervals in the limit uniquely<br/>articulated, 9:10 separate from 8:9. Well, my 22-tET proposal<br/>wouldn&apos;t qualify in the 7-limit for you, then, because 5:7 and 7:10<br/>are the same in 22-tET. But that doesn&apos;t bother me. I usually voice<br/>chords so that the half-octave represents 5:7 rather than 7:10, so<br/>for an otonal chord I&apos;d use a voicing like 2:5:6:7, and for a utonal<br/>chord, say, 1/12:1/7:1/6:1/5. That works out rather well in the<br/>consonance department. Similarly, in a meantone you could always use<br/>9:4s rather than 9:8s, and 9:5s rather than 10:9s, to get 9-limit<br/>consonance really happening.</p></div><h3><a id=22843 href="#22843">ðŸ”—</a>Robert C Valentine &#x3C;BVAL@IIL.INTEL.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2001 4:06:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;    From: <a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: Re: 7 and 9 limit theory<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, the meantone 7&apos;th implications seem pretty obvious even though<br/>&gt; &gt; I am much more facile with jazz theory (which basically simplifies<br/>&gt; &gt; everything to &quot;12tet and harmony&quot; rather than noticing all the<br/>&gt; &gt; evolution from &quot;pre-12 and counterpoint&quot;).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So bII7  -&gt; Db-F-Ab-B -&gt; 4-5-6-7<br/>&gt; &gt;    bVI7  -&gt; Ab-C-Eb-F#<br/>&gt; &gt;    bVII7 -&gt; Bb-D-F-G#<br/>&gt; &gt; etc...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Well in Western music theory and practice, chords notated like this<br/>&gt; (and that sound 7-limit in meantone theory and practice) are<br/>&gt; augmented sixth chords, not seventh chords.</p><p>Right, which is why I mentioned that jazz theory (read theory necessary<br/>to play twentieth century popular music) is based on &quot;12tet and<br/>harmony&quot;.

I got the advice from <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> to<br/>&gt; delete all my &quot;corrupted&quot; cookies, which is what they thought my<br/>&gt; problem was with playing mp3 files.  I deleted everything according<br/>&gt; to their instructions, and then the problem started AGAIN.  Only<br/>when<br/>&gt; I went into the &quot;administration&quot; area of <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> and tried to play<br/>a<br/>&gt; mp3 from THERE, where the sign-in screen doesn&apos;t pertain, would the<br/>&gt; mp3s play.  THEN, they would play ANYPLACE, and the sign-in, info.<br/>&gt; screen never appeared again.  Isn&apos;t that strange??</p><p>Yes!</p><p>&gt; Yes, I do know this.. and it has been a &quot;lifesaver&quot; during power<br/>&gt; outages upon occasion...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Just thought people might appreciate being able to see<br/>&gt; &gt; the text files and be able to double click on them to see them<br/>&gt; &gt; - you never know, might be useful to have a backup of ones<br/>&gt; &gt; most recent SCALA copy command at all times.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh sure... now that I know it&apos;s only ONE file!</p><p>Okay fine, can see how one would have trepidations about<br/>filling a directory with hundreds of text files!

These are BIG, BIG, BIG improvements in<br/>&gt; SCALA, and I hope you can help Manuel implement them in his<br/>program,<br/>&gt; so that they are in ALL the releases of BOTH 1.7 and 2.0!  This is<br/>&gt; very important...

I think it depends most on how much relative importance<br/>you place in the dichotomy of odd- vs. prime-limit.</p><p>This lattice, like all the ones we draw here, is a prime-limit<br/>one.  Each dimension of the lattice represents a different<br/>prime-factor.</p><p>An odd-limit diagram such as Partch&apos;s Tonality Diamond gives<br/>each odd number its own dimension.</p><p>I find both useful, for different purposes.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=23034 href="#23034">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/17/2001 3:48:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Bob<br/>&gt; &gt;   Paul<br/>&gt;     Bob<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; There is also just the transform of 5-limit minor to 7-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; minor.

It&apos;s a way of life.<br/>To this day, We *still* think, because it came from Brun,<br/>that there&apos;s resources untapped in the algorithm.<br/>Every few years we find something else in it.</p><p>Works kinda a little like this:</p><p>inta   a1  a2  a3<br/>intb   b1  b2  b3<br/>intc   c1  c2  c3</p><p>Where inta is just interval &quot;a&quot;, and there&apos;s a matrix<br/>corresponding to the number of notes in each interval.<br/>Stack the intervals largest to smallest.<br/>Perform this operation:</p><p>inta/intb   a1     a2     a3<br/>  intb    a1+b1  a2+b2  a3+b3<br/>  intc      c1     c2     c3</p><p>Assuming you start with inta = the octave,<br/>or whatever the largest interval you want to dissect is,<br/>keep performing the operation,<br/>resorting the list after every time.<br/>Easy to set up a macro in Excel, but I use HyperCard.</p><p>What the algorithm does, or a blunt interpretation,<br/>is it finds temperaments in which these intervals<br/>are becoming more and more and more accurate.<br/>(There&apos;s a *little* cross reference around,<br/>in something we just wrote about Relative Cents.)</p><p>First thing you find is the largest number at any one sort,<br/>in the first column (a1, b1, c1) is a convergent temperament.<br/>After that, there emerges two classes:<br/>one, when the a1+b1 yields the highest number and intb &gt; inta/intb,<br/>and the other when it doesn&apos;t.<br/>There&apos;s a condition of strength there,<br/>We&apos;ve worked with it for 10 years in plain text temperaments<br/>and bold text temperaments.  Never named it, did We.<br/>Main and Auxiliary, maybe.<br/>The main ones, the map spills into easily,<br/>the auxiliary, you have to spill from above,<br/>as was shown in 17 as a compound of 10+7,<br/>spilling all the way down from 53,46,34,22,12.</p><p>HUH?

Why not.<br/>&gt;&gt; Try it in 17 (10 + 7).</p><p>...fast thoughts from the Lab often sound like slow insanity.</p><p>In many other words:<br/>[2M3 = P5]<br/>or<br/>[2m3 = P5]<br/>or<br/>&quot;The anomaly 5:4=6:5&quot;<br/>or...<br/>&quot;6:5 and 5:4 mapped to the same note.&quot;</p><p>...all of these are expressing the exact same thing.</p><p>We might also now add &quot;VMT&quot; for Valentine meantone? :P<br/>Or at least Neutral Third Meantone.
