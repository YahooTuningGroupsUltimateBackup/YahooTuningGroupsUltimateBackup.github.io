I honestly think that it would be fair to let people who<br/>are interested in what Ray is saying respond instead of beginning some<br/>assinine Perfect/natural/Pure/Tet war yet again<br/>You start organizing your thought--I&apos;ll start trimming qoutes<br/>Deal?</p><p><a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Pat Pagano, TD 176.13]<br/>&gt; &gt; Ray you seem to find that alot around here people addressing &gt;<br/>&gt; everything BUT the point you<br/>&gt; &gt; are interested in,mind that spelling and trim those replies though!<br/>&gt; &gt; The point being<br/>&gt; &gt; We should not compromise at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pat, I felt the need to reply to this since I&apos;m one of those<br/>&gt; who&apos;ve complained about spelling and length of quoti.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First of all - I don&apos;t think anyone&apos;s ever requested that the<br/>&gt; *replies* be trimmed: I personally like really long and well-<br/>&gt; thought-out responses.  It&apos;s the unnecessary  *quoting* of<br/>&gt; old posts I complained about.  Maybe it&apos;s anal of me to<br/>&gt; suggest it, but if everyone provided Digest.Message reference<br/>&gt; numbers in their quotes, it would be easy to go back and read<br/>&gt; the original, so those of us who save all these Digests don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have so much redundant waste of hard-drive space.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Along these lines, I&apos;m hoping some day to publish the Digests<br/>&gt; in print, and it would mean a lot of wasted paper.<br/>&gt; (Feel sympathetic to our tree friends)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Secondly, I realize that everyone has his own personal literary<br/>&gt; style, and in an open forum like this, there&apos;s no reason why<br/>&gt; that aspect of individualism should be curbed.  But careful<br/>&gt; spelling and punctuation add immensely in helping to get a<br/>&gt; point across.  You and Kriag Grady are the biggest offenders<br/>&gt; here, and I think it&apos;s a shame, because you both invariably<br/>&gt; have something interesting to say.  It just makes it more<br/>&gt; difficult to wade thru it and get the gist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And we all (me too) make typos now and then, so I&apos;m not saying<br/>&gt; everyone needs to be perfect... but a little more effort in<br/>&gt; this areas would be appreciated, at least by me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph L.
