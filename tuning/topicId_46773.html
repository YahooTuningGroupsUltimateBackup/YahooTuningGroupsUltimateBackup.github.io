But Heasler had no<br/>better idea than the tourists around him as to when the world&apos;s tallest<br/>geyser would next erupt.</p><p>Unlike Old Faithful, Steamboat is anything but predictable. It&apos;s gone<br/>as few as four days and as many as 50 years between major eruptions &#xFFFD;<br/>noisy, powerful spectacles that can send hot water 300 feet or higher<br/>and churn out dense steam for hours.</p><p>Recently, though, it has been more active &#xFFFD; its two eruptions so far<br/>this year came just weeks apart &#xFFFD; and the emergence of a forceful new<br/>thermal feature nearby has scientists like Heasler wondering: What&apos;s<br/>happening in Norris Geyser Basin, where Steamboat is located?</p><p>&quot;That&apos;s the million dollar question. It&apos;s changing more than anyone has<br/>noticed before,&quot; Heasler said. &quot;Are we noticing because we&apos;re looking?<br/>Or because something is abnormal?&quot;</p><p>Researchers are trying to find answers. They&apos;ve installed monitoring<br/>devices throughout the basin &#xFFFD; near features such as Steamboat and in<br/>creek channels that collect water runoff from geysers &#xFFFD; to gather data<br/>on such things as water temperature and flow levels, basic information<br/>that, they say, was previously lacking and could help unlock the<br/>mysteries of Norris.</p><p>Among them: What&apos;s bubbling beneath the shallow surface of the volatile<br/>basin and why has the basin floor been steadily bulging upward over the<br/>past few years?</p><p>Adding to the intrigue is Norris&apos; location. The basin &#xFFFD; filled with hot<br/>springs, geysers and steam vents called fumaroles &#xFFFD; is outside<br/>Yellowstone&apos;s caldera, formed by the last volcanic eruption about<br/>640,000 years ago and considered the hotbed for geothermal activity in<br/>the park.</p><p>Some 10,000 hot springs and geysers pock the park&apos;s landscape, their<br/>telltale steam often visible to tourists traveling park roads. But the<br/>Norris basin is frequently passed by, viewed from the car by motorists<br/>headed south to Old Faithful.</p><p>Perhaps the reason Norris is so dynamic, researchers say, is that<br/>there&apos;s molten material beneath the basin. Or, maybe, hot water from<br/>the caldera has pushed north to Norris.</p><p>The trouble is, very little is known about the inner workings of<br/>Norris, where a geyser eruption can trigger the draining &#xFFFD; it looks<br/>like the flushing &#xFFFD; of a nearby pool.</p><p>Scientists for years have studied features within the basin &#xFFFD;<br/>Steamboat, for example, or Echinus, the world&apos;s only acidic geyser. But<br/>the basin&apos;s &quot;vital signs,&quot; measurements like the amount of heat it puts<br/>out or the volume of water it generates, are hard to come by.</p><p>Relying now on grants, researchers hope to continue monitoring efforts<br/>for at least the next three years, using what they find with satellite<br/>imagery and other information, such as climate data, to help piece<br/>together the puzzle.</p><p>&quot;Our goal is to understand what&apos;s driving the volcanic system, and are<br/>there indications it could be moving into a period of unrest?&quot; said<br/>Jacob Lowenstern, a researcher for the U.S. Geological Survey (news -<br/>web sites) and scientist-in-charge of the Yellowstone Volcano<br/>Observatory, a consortium that monitors the volcano and regional<br/>earthquakes (news - web sites).</p><p>Better understanding the Norris basin in west-central Yellowstone and<br/>its volatility is important to visitor safety. So far, there&apos;s no cause<br/>for alarm and no apparent looming threat, Lowenstern said. Steamboat&apos;s<br/>renewed eruptions and the basin rising several centimeters in the past<br/>few years could just be normal activity, he said.</p><p>The geyser&apos;s first major eruption was reported in 1878. After that, it<br/>flared up occasionally before lying largely dormant from 1911-61.<br/>Observers say the 1960s and the early 1980s were fairly active.</p><p>Then, quiet again, until May 2000. That was followed by two eruptions<br/>in 2002 and two more again this spring &#xFFFD; March 26 and April 27.</p><p>Paul Strasser, a self-proclaimed &quot;geyser gazer&quot; from Colorado, has<br/>returned to the park religiously to document even the minor stirrings<br/>of Steamboat since seeing the first of two major eruptions in 1982.</p><p>Though Strasser doubts it will ever be predictable or that its activity<br/>is somehow linked to the inner workings of Norris, he believes<br/>Steamboat may behave a certain way leading to an eruption.</p><p>&quot;Steamboat does what it darn well wants to,&quot; he said. &quot;Whether there is<br/>more activity now, I don&apos;t know. All I can look for is the patterns.&quot;</p><p>Heasler said the new research could help determine if Steamboat is a<br/>reliable predictor of more significant activity in the basin. But, for<br/>now, he is like the tourists and interpretive ranger John Tebby, taken<br/>with the shooting spray of the almost daily minor bursts and hoping to<br/>be around for the next Big One.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s one of the reasons I love being here, having the chance to see<br/>it,&quot; Tebby said. &quot;It&apos;s like they say, &apos;You can&apos;t win the lottery unless<br/>you buy a ticket.&apos;&quot;</p><p>___</p><p>On the Net:</p><p>Yellowstone National Park: <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yell">http://www.nps.gov/yell</a></p><p>Norris Geyser Basin virtual tour:<br/><a href="http://www.nps.gov/yell/tours/norris/index.htm">http://www.nps.gov/yell/tours/norris/index.htm</a></p><p>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
