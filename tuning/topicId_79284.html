So T is approximately a constant (f_0 l)^2 times d^2. This<br/>means that</p><p>B = const. x d^2 / (l^2 x (f_0 l)^2)</p><p>So we expect B to rise steeply in the treble. (Also possibly in the<br/>low bass where f_0 l becomes smaller to prevent enormously long strings.)</p><p>Also, for a fixed pitch, sounding length and material density, both<br/>the tension and the inharmonicity rise steeply with the string<br/>diameter. The main difference of the piano is just this significantly<br/>larger string diameter.</p><p>The strain (tension per cross-sectional area) goes as rho (f_0 l)^2,<br/>so trying to lengthen the scaling is impossible if you&apos;re already near<br/>the breaking strain.

Brits used<br/>separate bass bridges from the get-go for pianos, meaning they could<br/>keep the bottom end of the &quot;iron&quot; bridge longer than when it has to<br/>meet a brass scale, which kept inharm reasonably low in the bottom.<br/>The Wieners all tried separate bridges c.1805-10 and gave up on the<br/>extra work, except Graf who kept on with it. Walter is a good example<br/>of how bad it can get down there. Not only did he use a single bridge<br/>but he was a cheap bastard who didn&apos;t want to pay anymore than<br/>required for brass (hard stuff to make, brass, plus copper has always<br/>been in high demand - makes such good canons when mixed with a touch<br/>of tin!). The standard brass/steel transition point in Wiener pianos<br/>was F, one octave above the bottom until they ran the bottom down to<br/>CC. But good old Anton W. ran his steel down to Eb or even D<br/>sometimes, and you really notice it when you tune these babies; things<br/>start getting all wanky as you approach the brass, and then suddenly<br/>the sun comes out and the birds sing for the firs few notes of brass<br/>before it starts going all funny for the bottom few notes. Nothing<br/>quite as interesting as the number of different solutions there are to<br/>tuning the octave FF-F, all them of equally &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They say &quot;.. the stiffness of piano strings is much greater than in<br/>&gt; harpsichords due to the larger string diameters and the<br/>&gt; correspondingly high tensions (...) in order for the instrument to<br/>&gt; produce high volumes of sound. Hence it is expected that B will also<br/>&gt; be larger for the pianos than the harpsichords.&quot;</p><p>Lots of things missing/wrong in this little study. What kind of wire<br/>is on these instruments currently? Most certainly NOT original.<br/>Antiques can be strung with everything from a variety of<br/>&quot;reproduction&quot; wires (of which none of them are) to modern music wire.<br/>The use of &quot;standard values&quot; for E of brass, iron, and steel is about<br/>as trustworthy as using &quot;standard values&quot; for modern aircraft cruising<br/>speeds based on published airline flight times. Plus &quot;iron&quot; has NEVER<br/>been used as a stringing material.</p><p>What pitch levels are the instruments tuned at?</p><p>What is the scale design like?</p><p>But yeah, the main thing is diameter, which is bigger on bangers than<br/>pluckers, so inharmonicity is higher, (yawn) what else is new?

Yet another example of<br/>science guys flailing about at some topic while failing to realize<br/>that their myopic viewpoint is undermining the veracity of their<br/>results. To wit:</p><p>It&apos;s rather obvious to me why their Kirkman experimental results don&apos;t<br/>jive with the predictions. First, they are using off-the-shelf iron<br/>values for E and just assuming that the wire on the instrument has the<br/>same value. Totally scientifically INVALID. Second, looks to me like<br/>somebody changed out a few broken strings in the treble with modern<br/>wire, whilst the rest is probably strung in Malcolm Rose &quot;A Iron&quot;.</p><p>Actually, measuring the inharmonicity gives the value of E! Doh!<br/>Plugging-in some generic value and thinking it is somehow valid for an<br/>unknown material is just plain stupid.</p><p>They are also completely up the creek about tension being a cause of<br/>increased values of B. Increased tension, if it were possible to<br/>isolate, would REDUCE B, not increase it. The only fly in the ointment<br/>is that short of making a string longer, which is limited by the<br/>rupture load of the material, the ONLY way you can increase tension is<br/>by increasing diameter (mass being pretty much a constant for all<br/>ferrous-based steels, since anything other than Fe will always be in<br/>trace amounts). And when you increase D, which increase rigidity, then<br/>T also goes up. So what?</p><p>It&apos;s like these guys can juggle the numbers alright, but they don&apos;t<br/>really UNDERSTAND what&apos;s going on in terms of real-world physics of<br/>vibrating strings, i.e. it&apos;s the amount of rigidity-induced restoring<br/>force relative to tension-induced restoring force that produces<br/>inharmonicity  in the first place. When the former goes up OR the<br/>latter goes down, B goes up, but when the former goes down OR the<br/>latter goes up, B goes down. I always thought scientists were supposed<br/>to be trained at realizing this sort of interconnectivity between<br/>factors and how to isolate the primary causes from other things which<br/>just go along for the ride, but what do I know?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They say &quot;.. the stiffness of piano strings is much greater than in<br/>&gt; harpsichords due to the larger string diameters and the<br/>&gt; correspondingly high tensions (...)</p><p>There they go again.

Stephen Birkett<br/>is also doing some high-end research trying to model hammer covering<br/>dynamics. He says all current models fail to explain what happens in<br/>reality. But this won&apos;t change inharmoncity, only the brightness of<br/>the tone, i.e. the amount of higher partial excitation. Inharmoncity<br/>can be hidden by a dull tone, but it is still there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To me, the key experiment would be to go to a place like<br/>&gt; the Harpsichord Clearing House and measure some brand-new<br/>&gt; fortepianos from different builders, and then do the same<br/>&gt; thing at a fine piano showroom in New York, and compare<br/>&gt; the harmonicity and spectral balance.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what you mean by spectral balance; do you mean spectral<br/>content? Furthermore, you&apos;ve got your terminology turned around. Since<br/>INharmonicity is ALWAYS present, we will never be measuring<br/>harmonicity. Harmonicity is a subclass on the braoder concept of<br/>congruence, which is an absolute: anything which is not congruent,<br/>even only by a very small amount, is incongruent.</p><p>Only wind instruments and bowed strings exhibit harmonicity. And<br/>electronics, too, of course.</p><p>&gt;  If anybody knows of<br/>&gt; data like this, please share.  My own hunch is that the<br/>&gt; harmonicity of the modern designs would be better or at<br/>&gt; least no worse.</p><p>My experience tuning instruments tells me you would be quite wrong.<br/>One thing the paper shows is that inharmonicity in early instruments,<br/>including pianos, is next to nill in the lower octaves, especially the<br/>tenor where one sets the temperament. As you move upward, it gets<br/>worse, but it doesn&apos;t matter because the higher harmonics drop out and<br/>you are only concerned with how the octave works looking downward. I<br/>tune my octaves harmonically pure, i.e. no audible beats, and I can<br/>tell you from having checked many times against electronic references<br/>that even big 6 1/2 octave pianos require either no stretch or only<br/>very little to keep the topmost octaves sounding pure with the rest.<br/>When any stretch is need, it is only the highest octaves and only very<br/>very little. Not the case with modern pianos. They require stretch<br/>everywhere. If you tune a modern piano tenor octave perfectly note for<br/>note by setting unisons to an electronic reference (with pure octaves<br/>thus) I can tell you from experience the the octaves will beat. Thus,<br/>high inharmonicity.</p><p>&gt; But I think Tom is probably right that<br/>&gt; fortepianos get a greater helping of higher partials.</p><p>It depends on how they are voiced. Some builders go for what we in the<br/>trade call the &quot;mini-Steinway&quot; sound. Others, like me, point to the<br/>vast evidence that the instruments were voiced quite brightly until<br/>after 1800, and even then there were two schools. A 5 octave FePo out<br/>to be able to hold its own in concert in the literature written for<br/>it, such a Mozart &amp; Beethoven trios, or the wind quintets. I can tell<br/>you from experience that half the modern &quot;copies&quot; get lost in the mix,<br/>some of them overpowered by a single violin with gut strings!

Since<br/>&gt; INharmonicity is ALWAYS present, we will never be measuring<br/>&gt; harmonicity.</p><p>I take them to be simple inverses, so I can express results<br/>of a measurement either way.</p><p>&gt; Harmonicity is a subclass on the braoder concept of congruence,<br/>&gt; which is an absolute: anything which is not congruent, even<br/>&gt; only by a very small amount, is incongruent.</p><p>Sorry, but this just seems like nitpicking to me.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If anybody knows of<br/>&gt; &gt; data like this, please share.  My own hunch is that the<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonicity of the modern designs would be better or at<br/>&gt; &gt; least no worse.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My experience tuning instruments tells me you would be quite<br/>&gt; wrong.  One thing the paper shows is that inharmonicity in early<br/>&gt; instruments, including pianos, is next to nill in the lower<br/>&gt; octaves, especially the tenor where one sets the temperament<br/>&gt; As you move upward, it gets worse, but it doesn&apos;t matter because<br/>&gt; the higher harmonics drop out and you are only concerned with<br/>&gt; how the octave works looking downward. I tune my octaves<br/>&gt; harmonically pure, i.e. no audible beats, and I can tell you<br/>&gt; from having checked many times against electronic references<br/>&gt; that even big 6 1/2 octave pianos require either no stretch or<br/>&gt; only very little to keep the topmost octaves sounding pure with<br/>&gt; the rest.  When any stretch is need, it is only the highest<br/>&gt; octaves and only very very little. Not the case with modern<br/>&gt; pianos. They require stretch everywhere. If you tune a modern<br/>&gt; piano tenor octave perfectly note for note by setting unisons<br/>&gt; to an electronic reference (with pure octaves thus) I can tell<br/>&gt; you from experience the the octaves will beat. Thus, high<br/>&gt; inharmonicity.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s something.  It&apos;d be nice to have quantitative<br/>data, based on recordings made with the same mic, etc.</p><p>I listened to some of the audio files on your site, as well<br/>as at HCH.  Unfortunately they&apos;re all of music, which is of<br/>course useless in this context. :P  And it&apos;s hard to tell the<br/>effects of well temperament from inharmonicity differences.<br/>But strictly from qualitative listening, I hear no evidence<br/>for lower inharmonicity in fortepianos.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But I think Tom is probably right that fortepianos get<br/>&gt; &gt; a greater helping of higher partials.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It depends on how they are voiced. Some builders go for what<br/>&gt; we in the trade call the &quot;mini-Steinway&quot; sound. Others, like<br/>&gt; me, point to the vast evidence that the instruments were voiced<br/>&gt; quite brightly until after 1800, and even then there were two<br/>&gt; schools. A 5 octave FePo out to be able to hold its own in<br/>&gt; concert in the literature written for it, such a<br/>&gt; Mozart &amp; Beethoven trios, or the wind quintets. I can tell<br/>&gt; you from experience that half the modern &quot;copies&quot; get lost in<br/>&gt; the mix, some of them overpowered by a single violin with gut<br/>&gt; strings!

In England it is called the<br/>Sopranino following the nomen datum of the recorder family. Its<br/>dimensions are approximately those of a quarter-size violin, but in<br/>construction it is quite different. In order to achieve the transposed<br/>violin sound, the Treble not only has extremely thick top and back<br/>plates, but extra large f-holes and strategically placed small holes<br/>in the shallow ribs so that its main resonances occur at the desired<br/>frequencies. Michael Praetorius projected an instrument in this tone<br/>range, but without the high E-string, so that in effect there were<br/>only three strings. Since the string length must be at least long<br/>enough for a player to finger consecutive semitones securely, the E<br/>string (tuned to 1320 Hz) must be extremely strong and thin. A<br/>space-age material known as carbon rocket wire, with a tensile<br/>strength nearly twice that of the normal violin E string wire, is used<br/>for this purpose. Even so, this wire is close to the breaking point.<br/>No wonder Praetorius omitted it in his tuning of high treble!&quot;</p><p>Pic. at:<br/><a href="http://www.newviolinfamily.org/pdf/Newsletter%202%20Revised%20October%2021.pdf">http://www.newviolinfamily.org/pdf/Newsletter%202%20Revised%20October%2021.pdf</a><br/>on page 8 of the document.</p><p>&quot;tring Strife.<br/>We could find no material with<br/>enough tensile strength to<br/>withstand the tension of e&quot;&apos; (1325<br/>Hz) at a length dictated by the<br/>standard violinmaker&apos;s formula<br/>for neck dimensions. At first we<br/>used conventional violin strings<br/>in all sizes and got a surprising<br/>number of them to work, but<br/>nothing we tried would suffice<br/>for the E string. To keep a more<br/>comfortable string length, we<br/>made the neck two centimeters<br/>longer and tuned the strings<br/>down a step, but we still could<br/>not find an E string that would<br/>not break.<br/>Finally, through the Bell<br/>Telephone laboratories, we<br/>located carbon &quot;rocket wire&quot;<br/>manufactured by the National<br/>Standard Company in Niles,<br/>Michigan. Even though the wire<br/>is only 0.007&quot; in diameter, this<br/>space age-material had a tensile<br/>strength of 530,000 psi (pounds<br/>per square inch) as compared to<br/>350,000 psi for standard steel E<br/>string wire. Rocket wire worked<br/>quite well, but musicians still<br/>complained that even if the string<br/>did not break, the instrument was<br/>much harder to play with strings<br/>tuned a tone lower.<br/>We made a longer nut, thus<br/>shortening the string length so a<br/>rocket-wire E could be tuned to<br/>1325 Hz and still hold. The string<br/>length of 8-2/3 inches continues<br/>to pose problems for many<br/>players, especially those with<br/>wide fingers, and it is still difficult<br/>to finger consecutive semitones<br/>without sliding the fingers<br/>around....</p><p><a href="http://www.catgutacoustical.org/research/articles/fiddfam/fiddfam8.htm">http://www.catgutacoustical.org/research/articles/fiddfam/fiddfam8.htm</a><br/>&quot;A string material of requisite tensile strength to reach the high E<br/>1320 was finally found in carbon rocket wire, made by National<br/>Standard Company.

I<br/>&gt; find these a league above most other dull, lifeless classical<br/>strings<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve tried.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Quite how lessening the high overtones brightens the tone is beyond<br/>me.<br/>&gt; Graham</p><p>Beyond me too :)</p><p>&quot;precise, bright tone with flamenco style finger-picking which is<br/>ideal for studio work.&quot;</p><p>Complete word salad... written by the marketing department.<br/>All string industry hype, all too common nowadays. They have to tell<br/>some kind of marketing story to sell strings, and the stories are all<br/>in competition with each other - because the strings are very<br/>similar. Facts are few and fancy phrases are<br/>many!</p><p>Rectified nylon has been first extruded and then run through a<br/>controlled polishing process which reduces the diameter to a uniform<br/>result perhaps better than some extrusion processes. They have a<br/>little different feel under the fingers but there is really no<br/>significant difference to me. (Since I switched to fluorocarbon and<br/>THAT&apos;s a significant difference.) Most guitar string companies have<br/>both rectified and plain nylon models to give the appearance of<br/>variety. Savarez was first on the scene about 20 years ago with<br/>fluorocarbon (their &quot;Alliance&quot; line) but the high E strings are<br/>frequently false.</p><p>Nylon has never sounded as good as gut, although it has been much<br/>improved since WWII when it was introduced. However, it is much<br/>easier to get quality control than with gut. Gut being an organic<br/>material is very variable, temperature and humidity sensitive, prone<br/>to breakage and fraying, and so on. Nylon is very temperature<br/>sensitive and goes up and down in pitch with slight changes.<br/>Fluorocarbon is much more stable and doesn&apos;t sound as much like<br/>&quot;plastic strings&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=79324 href="#79324">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2008 11:54:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jack,</p><p>&gt; &gt; Savarez does make &quot;composite fiber&quot; classical guitar strings,<br/>&gt; &gt; but they don&apos;t say what&apos;s in the composite.<br/>&gt; &gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Savarez&apos; material is &quot;fluorocarbon&quot; which no doubt has a more<br/>&gt; technical name.

Have you actually seen these strings?<br/>&gt; Do they look like fluorocarbon?</p><p>I used Savarez Alliance strings on and off from the early nineties<br/>until last year. The trebles (not the basses) are distinctly<br/>different from nylon. They are significantly louder than nylon, and<br/>the Savarez ones also have much more treble response, which, on some<br/>spruce top guitars, makes them unbearably shrill (this is worst with<br/>Savarez as opposed to other brands). Also, the high E strings, as I<br/>wrote, are frequently uneven and therefore don&apos;t play in tune,<br/>ruining the whole set, because they don&apos;t mix well with nylon tonally<br/>and you can&apos;t just replace the E string without buying another set.<br/>The high E strings also show a characteristic &quot;shredding&quot;<br/>delamination after about 5 to 6 weeks, which is not a problem since<br/>that&apos;s a normal lifespan.</p><p>Last year I embarked on a series of new string experiments (to find<br/>optimal strings for a pair of new guitars) and tested the<br/>&quot;carbon&quot; strings from Galli and Oasis. The Galli strings sounded<br/>great but deteriorated very rapidly, with the same characteristic<br/>shredding pattern as the Savarez high E, both the high E and the B<br/>sometimes in only 4 HOURs of playing time, so I found them un-usable.<br/>The Oasis strings were better, but not satisfactory because they were<br/>not even enough for consistent intonation, and also showed the<br/>characteristic delamination at about 3 weeks of use. (Last summer,<br/>after I started using the Seaguar, Oasis announced free beta sets of<br/>a new formula and sent me two sets with two B strings each and no<br/>High E. The B delaminated.) Then somebody turned me on to the Seaguar<br/>strings, last March and I was sold.</p><p>Although I can&apos;t say for certain that the commercial carbon strings<br/>and the Seaguar strings are the same material - and the Seaguar<br/>strings mercifully do NOT delaminate in the characteristic pattern -<br/>the materials are much more similar to each other than either is to<br/>nylon, and they use the same approximate diameters (significantly<br/>thinner than nylon) and therefore must have the same density, and<br/>they all make the same general type of tone, different from nylon.<br/>Clearly there are different formulas floating around since the<br/>several brands of commercial strings have varying degrees of the same<br/>common flaws.</p><p>&gt; Carl wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; ...

I&apos;m very interested to read a different point of<br/>view on this. As a matter of practical experience, the different<br/>gauges and materials of strings respond differently to being fretted,<br/>and each string therefore has its own &quot;intonation pattern&quot;. Just<br/>taking Byer&apos;s recommendations as a general guide to the<br/>possibilities, my own intonation tweaks are generally like this: If a<br/>string is fretting sharp or flat in the area of the octave, I<br/>lengthen or shorten the string at the bridge. If it&apos;s fretting sharp<br/>in the first four frets, I shorten it at the nut. Sometimes I<br/>discover that with different strings, or even one different string, I<br/>need to re-adjust. I don&apos;t do this intensively - I usually think<br/>about it for quite a while, then make one small adjustment and sit<br/>with it to make sure I&apos;m clear that this is making a definite change<br/>for the better. Typically shortening the B string at the nut makes<br/>the single most noticeable change for the better, because there is<br/>typically a wide split between the open B tuned to the E strings, and<br/>the D on the B string&apos;s third fret tuned against the open D string<br/>(the B in tune, the D will be sharp.)</p><p>However, this entire approach (of mine) is perhaps fatally flawed by<br/>the (obvious?) fact that the actual layout of the frets would have to<br/>be different for each string for true accuracy. And then that opens<br/>another can of worms. Merely changing the string length at one end or<br/>another of a fixed fret system still leaves problem areas of the<br/>fretboard. (No, I have no plans to go fretless any time soon.)</p><p>Your comments on this are welcome, including suggestions for<br/>different ways to look at it or possible different practical<br/>procedures.</p><p>I appreciate your argument that the different responses of the<br/>different strings are due to the different ratios between &quot;ambient<br/>extension&quot; and the added extension by fretting. This seems clear<br/>enough. So you are also saying that inharmonicity is a red herring,<br/>correct?</p><p>I think that inharmonicity is dealt with by the common saddle setback<br/>for all six strings, which can be individually adjusted to some<br/>extent, and that the stretch or extension issue is what&apos;s being dealt<br/>with by nut adjustments. Do I have that right or do you have a<br/>comment?</p><p>You (Paul) wrote:<br/>&quot; Figuring it all out is a bit tricky but requires no fancy pants<br/>math.

The basic theory (which I<br/>confirmed) is that stopping a string stretches it by about the same<br/>amount wherever you stretch it.  So there will be a difference between<br/>stopped and open strings.  The answer, then, is to adjust the length<br/>of open strings without affecting the fret placements.  Hence you need<br/>nut adjustments.  But bridge adjustments are still good enough for<br/>most people.</p><p>I don&apos;t think inharmonicity has anything to do with nut-adjustment.<br/>All you need to do is stretch the scale a bit.  Moving the bridge will<br/>do that.  Mostly you only care about intervals between strings, so you<br/>adjust the open string tuning a bit (still within the &quot;good&quot; range of<br/>an electronic tuner).</p><p>The systematic out-of-tune-ness of equal temperament is still an order<br/>of magnitude more significant than these tuning optimizations.<br/>Putting the frets in different places will make triads sound<br/>noticeably purer even if you don&apos;t get it quite right.  Of course, we<br/>all know the drawbacks.</p><p>                             Graham</p></div><h3><a id=79380 href="#79380">ðŸ”—</a>hfmlacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2008 6:59:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Andreas wrote:<br/>&gt; [...]&gt; Results confirm the existence of so-called &quot;octave stretch&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; previously reported in the literature.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Experiment used pure tones.

So<br/>wurden alte lange Instrumente kurzerhand abgeschnitten, gek&uuml;rzt -<br/>Â„gestutzt&quot;. Damit war nat&uuml;rlich auch eine &Auml;nderung der Besaitung Â–<br/>k&uuml;rzere aber dickere Saiten Â– in der unteren Mittellage und im Bass<br/>notwendig.

By that changed the stringing towards<br/>shorter and thicker, in the middle and bass position.<br/>The first &quot;babies&quot; were built by Kaps in 1865 of ca. 150cm.</p><p><a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Kaps_Klavierfabrik_AG">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Kaps_Klavierfabrik_AG</a></p><p>&gt; Probably to resolve their won melodic non-linearity.<br/>as they had acosutemed as habit on &quot;babies&quot; or low uprights.</p><p>Therhard claims:<br/>&gt; &gt; The preference of the ear for<br/>&gt; &gt; stretched successive pitch intervals on the one hand, and the<br/>&gt; &gt; occurrence of beats from the simultaneous sounding of simultaneous<br/>&gt; &gt; tones in stretched intonation, on the other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d be a bit careful about pushing it that far as well. Meldoic<br/>&gt; stretched octave preference is different for different people,<br/>&gt; registers, volume levels, tone colors, etc etc etc, whereas<br/>&gt; non-beating octaves on any specific instrument is an inflexible<br/>&gt; objectively verifiable solution to an acoustic reality.<br/>Simply by counting beats.</p><p>&gt; Rarely would<br/>&gt; the two coincide.<br/>Agreed.<br/>The divergence of that both can be wide,<br/>depending on the individual disposition.</p><p>&gt; I, for example, know that in the upper octaves I<br/>&gt; hear a pure octave played melodically as something almost as small as<br/>&gt; a major 7th. obviously there is no piano in the world with so much<br/>&gt; inharmonicity that I could kill both birds with one stone in my<br/>&gt; case.<br/>Which piano-sacling(mensur) would you personally prefer at soonest?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about bells?<br/><a href="http://www.speedylook.com/Inharmonicity.html">http://www.speedylook.com/Inharmonicity.html</a><br/>&quot;.... For this reason this effect is all the more important as the<br/>cords are short, and thus will be much more important on a small<br/>upright piano than on a large grand piano. This has as a consequence<br/>which it is in general impossible to obtain a correct agreement<br/>between two piano very different. If one correctly grants them for<br/>central C, the two pianos will be all the more d&eacute;saccord&eacute;s in the<br/>extremes which they are different.</p><p>The bell</p><p>The case of the Cloche is an extreme case, where the deviation<br/>compared to the harmonic model can reach Intervalle S of a third, even<br/>more.

In calculating<br/>these curves, we have assumed parameters more or less typical of the<br/>middle range of a piano keyboard. For this case, there are no beats<br/>unless the &quot;mistuning&quot; is more than about 0.3 Hz; more correctly, for<br/>smaller &quot;mistunings&quot; there is just a single &quot;beat null,&quot; followed by a<br/>beatless aftersound whose level depends on the &quot;mistuning.&quot; Above<br/>about 0.3 Hz beats do appear, as exemplified by the curve drawn for a<br/>&quot;mistuning&quot; of 0.64 Hz; even here, however, the time between beats is<br/>a bit larger than the 1.6 seconds which would be naively predicted<br/>(1/0.64 Hz = 1.6 s). The importance of Fig. 8 is that it indicates how<br/>an excellent tuner can, under some circumstances, use very fine tuning<br/>control in order to adjust the aftersound of each note to a more<br/>uniform level than if it were due entirely to imperfections in the<br/>hammer or the string mountings.</p><p>Fig. 8 Calculated vertical force on the soundboard when driven by two<br/>strings with different mistuning ( f).

This randomness may, however, hide an underlying<br/>regularity. If, for example, you take a sheet of paper and tear it,<br/>examination of one of the pieces will reveal an irregular and<br/>seemingly random rough edge; yet comparison with the other piece will<br/>show that one irregularity exactly matches the other. Our hypothesis<br/>here is that, in the same way, the seeming &quot;randomness&quot; of the tuning<br/>comes from the fact that the skilful tuner was adjusting this quantity<br/>to another randomness, namely the randomness of hammer imperfections,<br/>in such a way that the result is not random. It would be interesting<br/>to test this hypothesis by investigating, for example, whether good<br/>tuners are consistent in the &quot;mistuning&quot; of the individual trichords<br/>when tuning the same piano over and over again.</p><p>Reference:<br/>Kirk, R.

The Effect of Multiple Stringing on the Sound of the Piano</p><p>We will introduce ourselves to some of the consequences of multiple<br/>stringing on a piano with the help of experiments you can easily try.<br/>Repeatedly strike the C4 key of a piano while alternately pressing and<br/>releasing a finger (or pencil eraser) against two of the three<br/>strings, so that part of the time only one string is free to vibrate<br/>and the rest of the rime all three strings are sounding. With any<br/>reasonably well-tuned piano, the perceived loudness at your ears<br/>(expressed in sones) should be roughly 40 percent higher when three<br/>strings are active than when only one is producing a sound (see curve<br/>B of fig. 13.5), which is a quite significant change. The next<br/>experiment con&shy;sists in verifying in a crude and informal way that the<br/>total audibility time of the decaying tone is roughly the same whether<br/>three strings are active or only one. So far everything appears to be<br/>in accordance with our expectations. We also notice that the tone is a<br/>little thinner and perhaps less interesting when only one string is<br/>allowed to sound than it is when all three are set into vibration. To<br/>be sure, if the piano is badly out of tune the three strings will beat<br/>against one another to give the jangling sound conventionally<br/>associated with a barroom piano, while on a freshly tuned instrument<br/>there is only a hint of beats among the lower partials and a<br/>pleasantly shimmering suggestion of beating among the higher ones.</p><p> In 1959 Roger Kirk of the Baldwin Piano Company reported the<br/>preferences of a large group of people for the tuning relationship<br/>among the three strings of each so-called unison of a piano.&apos; He found<br/>that :<br/>the most preferred tuning conditions . . . are 1 and 2 cents maximum<br/>deviation among the strings of each note in the scale. Musically<br/>trained subjects prefer less deviation . . . than do untrained subjects.<br/>Close agreement was found between the subjects&apos; tuning pref&shy;erences<br/>and the way artist tuners actually tune piano strings.</p><p>He also found that a piano tuned so that the group of strings for each<br/>note of the scale covered a spread of 8 cents was acceptable to many<br/>listeners, and that the overall spread between the lowest and highest<br/>frequency strings was of more importance than the tuning of the<br/>intermediate string. The beat frequencies between the first five<br/>components (partials) of two C., strings tuned 2 cents and 8 cents<br/>apart are: )s 335 Hz beat that one uses in setting the<br/>equal-temperament fifth to G., (see sec. 16.6, part D). Note that<br/>partial 2 of the G., strings will have a similar bearing rate to<br/>obscure further the departure from just tuning. With the 8-cent<br/>interstring spread, on the other hand, the fifths be&shy;come pretty diffuse.</p><p>Let us turn now to the interval of a major third in equal temperament.<br/>Using a 2-cent detuning, the fifth component group of Ca has within it<br/>a 1.5-Hz maximum beating frequency, as does the fourth component group<br/>of the note E., if its strings similarly have a 2-cent detuning<br/>spread. Taking these together we see the possibility of beat<br/>frequencies as high as 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 Hz among the components upon<br/>which the interval is chiefly based. In section 16.7, we learned that<br/>the beating rate for a piano tuner&apos;s third in equal temperament is<br/>about 8 Hz, a little more than twice the smearing produced by the<br/>detuned unison. If the spread among members of a three-string &quot;unison&quot;<br/>were increased to 8 cents, the beating would become rapid enough to</p><p>Component:               1           2         3         4         5</p><p>2-cent difference:     0.30      0.61      0.91     1.20     1.50 Hz</p><p>8-cent difference:     1.21      2.42      3.53     4.80     6.10 Hz</p><p>Notice first of all that with the 2-cent detuning the beating rate for<br/>the first pair of partials is quite slow, as are those for the second<br/>and third pair of partials. As a result the tone sounds reasonably<br/>smooth when played by itself. The 8-cent spread gives a rather<br/>brighter sound, but it is not yet the sort of jangle one gets with a<br/>spread of 15 to 20 cents.</p><p>When we use a 2-cent detuning between strings, the 0.91-Hz beat<br/>frequency belonging to its set of 3rd components is just able to cover<br/>up the 0.89&shy; Hz beat that one uses in setting the equal-temperament<br/>fifth to G4 (see sec 16.6, part D). Note that partial 2 of the G4<br/>strings will have a similar bearing rata to obscure further the<br/>departure from just tuning. With the 8-cent inter string spread, on<br/>the other hand, the fifths be come pretty diffuse.</p><p>Let us turn now to the interval of a major third in equal temperament.<br/>Using a 2-cent detuning, the fifth component group of C4 has within it<br/>a 1.5-Hz maximum bearing frequency, as does the fourth component group<br/>of the note E4 if its strings similarly have a 2-cent detuning spread.<br/>Taking these together we se, the possibility of beat frequencies as<br/>high as 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 Hz among the components upon which the interval<br/>is chiefly based. In section 16.7, we learned that the beating rate<br/>for a piano tuner&apos;s third in equal temperament is about 8 Hz, little<br/>more than twice the smearing produced by the detuned unison. If the<br/>spread among members of a three-string &quot;unison&quot; were increased to 8<br/>cents, the bearing would become rapid enough to drown the temperament<br/>error completely. Clearly there is a trade-off of musical virtues<br/>between the two kinds of unison spread as one compares various musical<br/>intervals. In any event we have provided ourselves with another reason<br/>stringed keyboard instruments are so well-adapted to musical<br/>performance, despite the problems with fixed pitch that at first<br/>seemed insurmountable.</p><p> As a practical matter it proves to be exceedingly difficult to tune a<br/>set of unison strings to a true zero-beat condition (one even meets<br/>cases where it is literally impossible to do so). The question arises<br/>then whether or not people&apos;s preference for a slight detuning of the<br/>unisons is simply a favorable response to the most familiar type of<br/>sound, or whether something more fundamental is involved. Kirk finds<br/>that piano tuners and musicians are unanimous in their verdict that<br/>too-close tuning gives a tone that not only sounds dead but dies away<br/>too rapidly. Laboratory measurement confirms the auditory impression<br/>we gained in our initial experiments that slightly detuned (normal)<br/>strings die away in about the same total length of time as a single<br/>one of these strings when the other ones are prevented from vibrating.<br/>However, when three strings are tuned exactly together they will<br/>actually die away much more rapidly. The presence of other precisely<br/>in&shy;tune strings encourages each string to transfer its vibration more<br/>rapidly to the soundboard and thence to the room! Let us first make<br/>use of our knowledge of wave impedance to verify its consistency with<br/>these observations and then go on to an example of the same kind of<br/>physics displayed in an everyday experience far removed from acoustics.</p><p>In section 17.1 we learned that the wave impedance of a string is<br/>equal to the square root of the product of tension T and mass per unit<br/>length (O r2d). How do we find the corresponding impedance for a<br/>triplet of identical strings acting together? The top part of figure<br/>17.3 indicates the appearance of our three strings as they are<br/>normally seen in a piano. The middle part of the diagram shows them<br/>moved so close together that they are on the verge of touching. If<br/>they were identical- tuned strings, they would stay precisely in step<br/>with one another, and there would be no frictional or other force<br/>acting between them to change things in case they did touch. In other<br/>words, the three closely spaced strings will behave exactly like their<br/>more separate cousins. In particular, the aggregate impedances are the<br/>same in both cases. The bottom part of figure 17.3 shows the last step<br/>in our imaginary set of transformations: here the strings are fused<br/>together into a ribbon like whole, with no change of total mass or<br/>tension. An extension of our former reasoning shows that this new sort<br/>of string also retains the acoustical properties of its ancestor at<br/>the top-as long as we confine ourselves to vibrations of the normal<br/>type (up and down, as shown in the diagram).</p><p>Having done a little thinking about three strings acting precisely<br/>together, we are now ready to calculate. Clearly, the total tension<br/>acting on our composite string is three times the tension acting on<br/>each of the original strings, so we must write 3T under the square<br/>root sign where formerly there was a T. Similarly, any short length of<br/>the composite has precisely three times the mass of a corresponding<br/>length of ordinary wire, so we must also write 3(O r2d) in place of<br/>O r2d in the formula. Putting all this together, we get:</p><p>(wave impedance of a tricord )= 3 x (O r2d) x 3T=</p><p>= 3 x ( wave impedance of a single wire )</p><p>This shows us that three strings acting precisely together produce a<br/>threefold increase in the wave impedance, and thus a threefold<br/>increase in the amplitude of the bridge motion, which ultimately leads<br/>to a threefold reduction in the decay time of the vibration. You might<br/>find it worthwhile to deduce this last assertion on the basis of the<br/>principles outlined in section 6.1.</p><p>The expected difference in sound between a struck single string and a<br/>perfectly tuned triplet of strings is not hard to figure out on the<br/>basis of what we have just learned. First of all, the tone of the<br/>precisely tuned triple strings will die away much more quickly, which<br/>matches actual experience. Second, we would expect on the basis of<br/>curve A in figure 13.5 that the perceived loudness of the fundamentals<br/>of the  tone (as expressed in sones) would be very nearly doubled<br/>because of the threefold increase in source (soundboard) amplitude.<br/>The cone would not actually appear this much louder, however, because<br/>a short or decaying sound always sounds less loud that a steady one.<br/>In the three&shy; string case the increased rapidity of the decay<br/>partially offsets the perceived effect of the larger amplitude.</p><p>We seem by now to have left the slightly detuned strings of a real<br/>piano in a sort of unexplained limbo between the single string and a<br/>perfectly tuned triplet. The true behavior of detuned triplets will be<br/>easy to understand once we have looked ac the everyday example I<br/>promised a few paragraphs ago. Suppose you have undertaken to push<br/>your friend&apos;s small car along a fairly level road. If the rolling<br/>friction of the car is large, you may find is barely possible to keep<br/>the vehicle rolling, and yet you will be able to move the car quire a<br/>distance under these conditions without much strain and without<br/>becoming winded. Suppose on the other hand that you have acquired a<br/>helper in the pushing, so that the two of you together can get the<br/>speed up to a fast walk. Pushing at this faster pace will soon leave<br/>you winded and panting for breath, even if you are not pushing any<br/>harder as an individual than you were during the solo performance. The<br/>point is this: the energy you expend in pushing with a certain force<br/>over a given distance will be spent in a much shorter rime if your<br/>friend helps you make the trip more quickly. The rare at which you<br/>work is increased because of the cooperative presence of your friend.&quot;</p><p>bye<br/>A.S.</p></div><h3><a id=79439 href="#79439">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/8/2008 11:18:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand you are searching for my published article here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.musicstudies.org/Abjad_JIMS_071203.pdf">http://www.musicstudies.org/Abjad_JIMS_071203.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Happy reading and season&apos;s greetings!<br/>&gt; Oz.<br/>Thanx much!

The basic theory (which I<br/>&gt; confirmed) is that stopping a string stretches it by about the same<br/>&gt; amount wherever you stretch it.  So there will be a difference between<br/>&gt; stopped and open strings.  The answer, then, is to adjust the length<br/>&gt; of open strings without affecting the fret placements.  Hence you need<br/>&gt; nut adjustments.  But bridge adjustments are still good enough for<br/>&gt; most people.</p><p>Hi Graham,</p><p>I totally agree. The required nut adjustments are very small compared<br/>to the bridge adjustments and tend not to vary much between strings,<br/>according to the classical guitar paper referred to here.<br/><a href="http://www.byersguitars.com/research/intonation.html">http://www.byersguitars.com/research/intonation.html</a></p><p>The bridge adjustments are set-backs of the order of 1 to 5 mm (steel<br/>string guitar). The nut adjustments are set-forths. I use a fixed 0.5<br/>mm nut setforth. I can only do fret placement within +- 0.25 mm<br/>anyway. That&apos;s about +- 0.7 c at the nut and +- 1.4 c at the octave fret.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
