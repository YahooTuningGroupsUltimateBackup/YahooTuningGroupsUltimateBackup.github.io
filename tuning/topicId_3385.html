Erlich [TD204.15]</p><p>&gt;The current experimental and theoretical understanding of particle masses is<br/>&gt;embedded in the conceptual framework of Quantum Field Theory. In this<br/>&gt;theory, there is not only an uncertainty relation governing the positions<br/>&gt;and momenta of the particles, but also the very number of particles existing<br/>&gt;at a given point in time. I have not formally studied QFT, but I know that<br/>&gt;some of its predictions, such as the magnetic moment of the electron, are<br/>&gt;the most accurate (one part in 10^18) in all of science. You will have to<br/>&gt;come to terms with all its successes if you wish to propose a competing view<br/>&gt;of the universe. OK, that&apos;s enough particle physics for now.</p><p>I agree most strongly with the last sentence  :-)<br/>The values that agree so well are not exactly derived, they are<br/>gradually honed in on by making many fine changes to the theory and as<br/>such it cannot be said to be a single theory derivable from a single<br/>axiom.  In fact particle physics has dozens of axioms and fundamental<br/>constants, a sure sign that it is not as fundamental as other branches<br/>of physics.</p><p>The variations that you refer to as due to uncertainty are simply due to<br/>the short lives of particles and every particle type has an exact<br/>average value.  It is these average values which are quoted by<br/>physicists and which I am comparing as being nearly harmonically<br/>related.  I repeat that the similarities are just as great as the<br/>similarities of the masses of isotopes.</p><p>&gt;&gt;If so, I suggest that this depends very strongly on the algorithm used<br/>&gt;&gt;in the process.  I dealt with some considerations in this regard a<br/>&gt;&gt;couple of weeks ago and it is clear that slightly different algorithms<br/>&gt;&gt;can jump to different notes under the same circumstances and introduce<br/>&gt;&gt;ratios such as 80/81 etc.</p><p>&gt;OK, but these jumps are quite foreign to any accepted performance practices,<br/>&gt;and many musical situations (such as the chord d-f-g-a-c in C major) could<br/>&gt;not be remedied by such jumps anyway -- the 80/81 must vanish.</p><p>The most obvious treatment of the chord d-f-g-a-c in C major is<br/>20:24:27:30:36 which has the slightly ugly 20:27 which is what I assume<br/>you refer to.  In this case I think that it is the correct ratios and<br/>see no reason why this must be tempered to get rid of the 80/81.</p><p>Conceivable something like 12:14:16:18:21 could be played and resolve<br/>this problem, but if the piece in C then C is much more likely to want a<br/>36 ratio than a 21 and this alternative simply makes a 63/64 wobble<br/>instead of an 80/81 one.</p><p>&gt;... What do you mean by &quot;slight adjustements&quot;? And how<br/>&gt;do you propose to physically account for the &quot;undertones&quot;? In steady-state<br/>&gt;oscillations, resonant cavities can do nothing more than selectively amplify<br/>&gt;frequencies already present. The question is how they get there in the first<br/>&gt;place.</p><p>The &quot;slight adjustments&quot; refers to the singers statements that he<br/>produces the undertones by making only slight adjustments from the<br/>position where there was only the fundamental.  I am uncertain of the<br/>physics but feel strongly that his description is much more consistent<br/>with undertones than with hidden fundamentals and overtones.</p><p>A possible physics is that in a non-linear situation a subharmonic can<br/>be driven by getting a kick by every second oscillation of the<br/>fundamental.  The subharmonic would require some tuning somewhere that<br/>is approximately at half (or third or quarter) of the fundamental but it<br/>need not be exact.</p><p>&gt;I would argue that virtually every Western composer since the advent of the<br/>&gt;5-limit has been dealing not with the flat playing field you describe above,<br/>&gt;but a cylindrical one where the lattice bends back on itself so that<br/>&gt;commatic distinctions vanish.</p><p>You are probably right.  I am glad that you wrote &quot;western&quot; because in<br/>Indian music these difference notes are quite clearly found.  IMO this<br/>cylindrical thinking is wrong and results from giving the notes names<br/>that are too limited.  As I said elsewhere you would never play Db<br/>instead of D so why should you play D- instead of D?  The answer is only<br/>because most people didn&apos;t realise that D- is a different note to D.</p><p>With regard to notation, if there is a convention on D and D+ etc<br/>already in existence then I didn&apos;t mean to create confusion.  I can see<br/>good arguments for either of the notations given.  The one that you gave<br/>has a simpler layout whereas the one that I gave has all plain notes in<br/>the key of C.  The main thing is to be clear what we mean.</p><p>&gt;Finding the correct place for &quot;breaks&quot; could<br/>&gt;certainly be handled as you describe, but would have nothing to do with<br/>&gt;anything that went on in the mind of the composer or in the actions of the<br/>&gt;finest performers of his/her music.</p><p>What goes on in the mind of the composer is not all conscious and<br/>probably not describable in words at all.  However it would be very<br/>interesting to do some frequency analysis of the actual notes sung by<br/>top performers in some of these cases so that we can see what actually<br/>happens.  Is there any information on this?</p><p>I am interested to know what you think they do?</p><p>&gt;And again, there are cases where by your<br/>&gt;reckoning D and D- would have to occur at the same time, in a single<br/>&gt;sonority, so even &quot;breaks&quot; would not solve the problem.</p><p>I agree that two of these can occur in a single chord.  I gave before an<br/>example something like the ratios 4:7:12:18:42:63 where the lowest and<br/>highest notes have the same name but are not the same note.  The most<br/>common cases of differences are 80/81, 63/64 (as above) and 35/36.</p><p>I see no problem in having such combinations if they are really required<br/>by the music.  It is certainly the case that music is so rich that there<br/>are competing forces and ambiguities.  Of course there are multiple ways<br/>of resolving the tensions that are so created.  Equitempered is one way.<br/>Just Intonation with drift is another.  JI with breaks at the weakest<br/>points is another.  Having a piece shift by half an octave is another,<br/>though I certainly don&apos;t like the sound of it as a norm, and it doesn&apos;t<br/>resolve all the problems anyway as you say.</p><p>My first preference is for breaks at the weakest points and my second<br/>choice is the gradual drift (but I regard this as an easy way out and a<br/>bit of a cop out).  My opinion might well change when I became<br/>acquainted with the actual top performance characteristics.
