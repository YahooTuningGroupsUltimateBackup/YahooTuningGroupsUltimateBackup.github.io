Scott was referring to<br/>&gt; here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The sheer volume of posts in this groups really<br/>&gt; DOES prevent the &apos;silent 400&apos; of the members<br/>&gt; from saying anything. They read the posts and<br/>&gt; are so confused and overwhelmed they don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know where to start or who to turn to or what<br/>&gt; is going on. That is not because there is anything<br/>&gt; wrong with what is being said, it&apos;s just because<br/>&gt; there is too much of it and it is overwhelming.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d just like to encourage all of you who fall into the above<br/>&gt; category to say hello, introduce yourselves, and ask any questions<br/>&gt; you may wish to, in order to combat this situation. Many of us will<br/>&gt; be more than willing to listen and talk about whatever interests<br/>&gt; _you_, what instruments (acoustic or electronic) you may play already<br/>&gt; or may be interested in learning to use for microtonality, de-mystify<br/>&gt; the various terminologies and ideas that are being thrown around, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is an open forum so everyone who feels inclined should post! We<br/>&gt; can all benefit from more ideas and more voices!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Love to all,<br/>&gt; Paul<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed.  I was inspired by Joseph Pehrson who persistently asked about what he didn&apos;t understand<br/>&gt; and openly admitted what he didn&apos;t know. And Joseph is an excellent composer in his own right.<br/>&gt; So I jumped in. Now his questioning has led to some very fruitful creative collaborations,<br/>&gt; particularly in the last two weeks.  The exchanges between &apos;experts&apos; and beginners is of mutual<br/>&gt; benefit. The more knowledgable theorists are courteous and generous with their time and effort.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve always been made to feel welcome with my comments and attempts at theorising. Once you&apos;re<br/>&gt; in you&apos;ll be glad you jumped. My only problem is the 600 or so posts that I&apos;ve saved for a rainy<br/>&gt; day. (I&apos;m hoping for a monsoon).</p><p>I don&apos;t know about the USA but in Britain there are thousands of bedroom musicians with a decent<br/>rack of gear, some of whom are no doubt lurking in the etherwings  looking for a bit more than<br/>freeze dried house and garage loops,. I would recommend even starting by putting together some<br/>beat tracks with microtonal bass lines and melodies using pitchbend. Then you&apos;ll get the bug and<br/>it&apos;s bye-bye to life as you knew it.</p><p>Peace to All</p></div>
