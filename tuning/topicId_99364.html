Harmonic minor is a<br/>case study for this - it contains a comma pump, but we don&apos;t need to<br/>use the full 12-note scale - we can just use the 7-note MODMOS<br/>harmonic minor subset of it. In fact, the whole point of harmonic<br/>minor is to have the comma pump in it but alter notes to get the chord<br/>qualities that we want, which would be a great approach to take to<br/>something like Orwell[9] where the chord qualities often just suck. We<br/>have two 6:7:9 chords a 7/6 away. I&apos;m not sure how workable Orwell<br/>specifically will be, but if you could figure out a way to get more<br/>usable chords while retaining at least one comma pump, then that might<br/>provide a better &quot;tonal&quot; foundation for the orwell system in general.</p><p>&gt; The block may be smaller, but in such cases there will be a<br/>&gt; block tone you can substitute, and this substitution will<br/>&gt; be perfect when the block is tempered.</p><p>How are we picking the block?
