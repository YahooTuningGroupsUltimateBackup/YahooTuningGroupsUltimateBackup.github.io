Is the file incomplete, or<br/>incompletely retuned?</p><p>[Monzo:]<br/>&gt; 12:15:18 is *NOT* an accurate analysis of a Dominant [V] chord.<br/>&gt; The (culturally-conditioned?) preference for a sharpened Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &apos;leading-tone&apos; makes this chord sound flat, at least in this piece,<br/>&gt; and to my ears.</p><p>I know that feeling, but I think it&apos;s a matter of getting used to it,<br/>as (in my opinion) to the 4:5:6:7 dominant 7th.</p><p>[Brett Barbaro/Paul Erlich, TD 206.3:]<br/>&gt; George Kahrimanis, who has (questionably) backed up his theories with<br/>&gt; experimental observations on preferences in synthesized performances,<br/>&gt; analyzes the dominant in minor as a utonal chord, the dominant seventh<br/>&gt; being tuned 1/9:1/7:1/6:1/5 and with its lowest note on the regular<br/>&gt; dominant. That gives a highly raised leading tone much in accord with<br/>&gt; the modern practice of a typical string quartet playing Beethoven.</p><p>Yecch!!  That&apos;s got the &quot;super-major&quot; chord we discussed a while back,<br/>which, as Gary Morrison pointed out, sounds more like a car horn than<br/>consonance.  At least the resolution to tonic minor would be a huge<br/>relief!</p><p>Let me issue a general invitation for MIDI sequence files featuring a<br/>single voice (probably piano?), that might be interesting and/or<br/>challenging to be retuned in JI.  I don&apos;t have my leisure retuning<br/>program written yet, but hope to begin serious work on it soon.

Finnamore, TD 207.9]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Renaissance compositions, even some Baroque ones, don&apos;t need<br/>&gt; that raised LT [&apos;leading-tone&apos;], to my ears, because there is<br/>&gt; more of a sense of simply hop-scotching around the lattice<br/>&gt; rather than of building and releasing harmonic tension.</p><p>Yes!  I think that&apos;s a great characterization of the difference<br/>in harmonic technique between Renaissance and later periods.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t personally see the point of making a Beethoven piece<br/>&gt; 5-lim JI, other than the simply educational purpose of<br/>&gt; taking it apart and putting back together intentionally<br/>&gt; wrongly to see what will happen.  It couldn&apos;t have been<br/>&gt; written that way, it wasn&apos;t intended to be, and it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; work well, anyway.  It assumes the vanishing comma, among<br/>&gt; other things.</p><p>Well... I agree with you that a well-temperament is probably<br/>the tuning that would be most suitable for Beethoven piano music.</p><p>But not for string quartets!  And Beethoven *did* arrange this<br/>sonata for string quartet.</p><p>Another reason I picked a Beethoven piece rather than one by<br/>another composer is because Beethoven went deaf - he was<br/>beginning to show the first signs of losing his hearing right<br/>around the time he wrote this piece.</p><p>I think this is an important consideration, and would say that<br/>it&apos;s probably more relevant for his later pieces, after he<br/>long been totally deaf, than for this particular one.</p><p>After not having been able to hear anything for a few decades,<br/>I would wager that there were sounds in his mind that were<br/>quite a bit different from those he became acquainted with<br/>audibly as a young man, especially since he himself, more<br/>than any other composer of his time, was the one pushing the<br/>envelope of what was possible compositionally.</p><p>My intention with this experiment, aside from its obvious<br/>educational aspects, was not to find a tuning which I believe<br/>*should* be used for Beethoven performance, but rather, just<br/>to create *my own interpretation* of what I think Beethoven<br/>may have had in his *mind*.</p><p>Admittedly, considering what I said in the above few paragraphs,<br/>I could probably justify this better by choosing a piece written closer<br/>to the end of his life, rather than this early one.  But<br/>I like this one and it&apos;s harmonically fairly straightforward,<br/>which can&apos;t always be said for Beethoven&apos;s later music.</p><p>I&apos;ve also been working for years on an analysis and MIDI sequence<br/>of his _C#-minor quartet, op. 131_, which IMO is one of the most<br/>profound pieces ever written.</p><p>But, as with my work on Mahler&apos;s _7th_ (also a very deep work),<br/>there is a lot here that is open to a wide variety of<br/>interpretations.

Strings don&apos;t need to do that</p><p>True.  In the context of Monz&apos;s Beethoven JI piano<br/>experiment (see Subject line), I was talking about a<br/>reasonably small number of fixed pitches per octave.  In<br/>that case, of course, the two D&apos;s will likely have to have<br/>the same pitch unless you suitably expanded the palette.</p><p>More to the point, intonationally ambiguous chords became<br/>increasingly common during the late Classical and Romantic<br/>periods, thanks in measure to ol&apos; Ludwig himself, until it<br/>became part of the very vocabulary of the music.  To rigidly<br/>tune those up can sometimes compromise the spirit, or at<br/>least reduce the impact, of a piece.  You have to be careful<br/>not to articulate a distinction between tones that are<br/>intended to be musical homonyms.  Another danger lies in<br/>chords that have an ambiguity that the composition relies<br/>on. Remove the ambiguity with JI and you&apos;ll damage the<br/>composition.</p><p>I&apos;ve tried going back to some of my 12t-ET stuff to look at<br/>putting it in JI.  More often than not it turns out to be a<br/>step backward for the piece of music, though a step forward<br/>for my understanding of the whole comma issue (which, as<br/>Paul E. rightly pointed out, might not be quite complete<br/>yet).  ET was so ingrained in my thinking (I&apos;ve got a<br/>useless B. Mus., for cryin&apos; out loud!) that even some of my<br/>earliest &quot;tuned&quot; pieces sound better in 12t-ET!  LOL!</p><p>You&apos;re right about strings, though, and choirs the same.  I<br/>wonder if what they essentially do is to distribute the<br/>comma(s) chaotically?  It&apos;s like, instead of sweeping the<br/>comma under the rug somewhere, they&apos;re able to break it up<br/>into dust and scatter it to the four winds.  Any Chaos<br/>theorists here?</p><p>David J.
