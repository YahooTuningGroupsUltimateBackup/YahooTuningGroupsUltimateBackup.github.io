No excuses, Brad, just tell us if you think the 7th<br/>&gt; harmonic is present, and if so, at what level, say perhaps over a<br/>&gt; range of three possibilities, which we could say would be:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. weak, hardly audible-2. normal, similar to other readily heard<br/>&gt; partials, especially those one might use to adjust commonly tempered<br/>&gt; intervals (fifths, thirds, etc)<br/>&gt; 3. strong, it sticks out like a sore thumb</p><p>Yes, its being a non-Italian IS that important.  The Italian single that I played again all morning Saturday (same one as last week) has a strikingly different timbre from the samples here...while it behaves similarly to my Italian virginal here.  In the temperament-setting region at the middle of the keyboard, its minor 21st (overtone 7) and the 23rd (overtone 9) are in there just barely long enough to assess a 7:4, 7:5, or 9:4 directly and zero out their beats.  At anything above two or three seconds after the initial pluck, all that stuff has already died away.  The sustained tone has hardly anything but roots, 5ths, and a faint major 17th.</p><p>That is to say, after the first two seconds of playing the notes on Italian-styled harpsichords as these, almost anything close to septimals (or for that matter to 45/32) sounds beatless in practice.  That&apos;s even more so when listening from playing position, which is a valid (while not optimal) place to do listening; as Paul helpfully explained on the technical side, and as I described empirically last week, there&apos;s cancellation.  It&apos;s a valid place to sit and listen now, and we have to consider the possibility that it was also a valid place to sit and listen for the now-long-dead theorists trying things at their own harpsichords.  And to tune anything accurately expecting to get beats and use them, it&apos;s necessary to reiterate the notes several times, focusing on the first second or two of the sound.</p><p>The cancellation at the player&apos;s position of a normally-shaped harpsichord is not so much an issue on a virginal, because the raised lid is sending the sound straight to and past the player&apos;s body.  But as I said at the start of these threads, which got pooh-poohed and worse, overtones 7 and up drop out so quickly that 45/32 sounds BEATLESS within a couple of seconds after the pluck.  When I&apos;m playing in 1/6 syntonic on this virginal, despite the direct sound and the theoretical presence of beating involving overtone 7, all twelve tritones (which are either 45/32 or 64/45) sound pure and beatless to me...which sound is part of the attraction of setting up 1/6 syntonic in the first place.  As soon as the noisy jangle of striking two-note or bigger chords has passed, within a second or so, the instrument rings out sounding resonant and beatless in what&apos;s left.  I&apos;ve tested it again here this morning, with the virginal open and the room as silent as I can make it.</p><p>On Saturday at the Italian harpsichord I also made sure the HVAC system was turned off most of the time, because right there that noise eats up whatever overtones would have been audible.  Not a 17th-18th century problem, of course; lucky them for not having to deal with any fans. That instrument Saturday was a more refined-sounding (i.e. less noisy immediately after pluck time) tone than I get here, and it had a little more 7 in it, but the fundamentals and the quint are so much stronger and better-sustained that 7 is negligible after two or three seconds.</p><p>Last night we had a concert with 20 students plus me as guest, playing Bach (and in my case Kuhnau) on a Steinway grand in the Bach temp.  The piano tuner did a terrific job with his unisons, octaves, and the evenly circulating 1/6 Pythagorean comma 5ths.  Lots of chords that should have had all kinds of beating in them, theoretically on paper, simply didn&apos;t at the audience positions; the instrument&apos;s sustained tone (pianos being weak in upper harmonics anyway...) sounded beatless at several meters away.  The C major and F major triads have a 1/6 PC 5th and a 3/11 SC sharp major 3rd in them, yet they sound utterly calm.  So does G major, with the same 5th but a +5/11 SC major 3rd.  Hearing the students play in E major, B major, C# major in the same pieces I am accustomed to playing and listening to myself on harpsichords, but here on piano, everything was so remarkably INactive by comparison with harpsichord that sometimes it didn&apos;t even seem like those keys/scales to me.  It merely sounded like a startlingly well-in-tune piano being almost beatless most of the time, whether the harmonies were simple or complex.   (And OK, some of the students did muddy things up by pedalling way too much, but when their foot was off the pedal the piano sounded clean.)</p><p>I walked around to different spots in the hall as some of them rehearsed, and found the response to be pretty consistent everywhere I went: no noticeable beats in music where it would be much more active in the same music on harpsichord.  The point of these remarks is that an instrument&apos;s timbre affects perception so much, and so do the distance and cancellation patterns, that any beating can be vastly different in theory vs musical practice.  Who&apos;s to say what a best listening spot is?   And for what purpose?  Musical blend?  Clearest Affekt?  As part of the talk I played out a couple of short wild-key Beethoven and Chopin excerpts I had rehearsed at home on harpsichord, and on this piano they sounded so much tamer I could scarcely believe it was the same temperament.  But it was, on close inspection of all the 4ths and 5ths.</p><p>Now, back to Paul&apos;s web samples that don&apos;t have an Italian-harpsichord tone.  I&apos;ll listen on QuickTime with Koss TD-61 headphones; not great but the best I have available.  The computer fan is quiet but not eliminated by the headphones.  And, of course, the recordings of these individual notes weren&apos;t made from anywhere near playing position.... And my usual way of assessing harmonics on harpsichord is not through single notes, but through having the liberty of playing a second note simultaneously (either above or below the fixed note being assessed) and moving it myself to find beat strengths.  All that said:</p><p>The game is to pick out the 7th harmonic....</p><p>- Clav002: &quot;2, normal&quot; - it&apos;s fairly easy to pick out the 7th here and it&apos;s well-sustained, while the 3rd and 6th harmonics (both playing the 5th degree above the root) are plenty stronger than the 7th is.  The sample becomes useless at the 10-second mark where it pulses with unnatural noise.  The 5th overtone (major 17th) makes its most noticeable appearance about eight seconds after the pluck.</p><p>- Clav007: &quot;1, weak&quot; - the 3rd harmonic is so strong in there that it&apos;s hard to hear much else, until the 5th one peeks around it after about six or seven seconds.  I can&apos;t hear any useful 7th harmonic in this tone.</p><p>- Clav011: &quot;1.5, on the weak side of normal&quot; - this tone has so much inharmonic beating in it by itself, a conflicting resonance at the soundboard, that it&apos;s hard to pick out much...especially among the odd harmonics.  The 2nd and 4th harmonics (octaves) are so strong and noticeable, past the inharmonicity, that they pretty much win.  I can hear only a ghost of a 7th in there, and scarcely enough to be useful.</p><p>- Clav015: &quot;2, normal&quot; - a decent amount of 7 in there, and a good balance all around.  The strongest harmonic in here, over most of the sustain, is 2.  I can find 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in here without any problem.  What&apos;s with the chirping that starts after about six seconds?</p><p>- Clav019: &quot;1, weak&quot; - the strong 3 and 4 in there pretty much block out my ability to hear much above them.  I can catch a whiff of 5, but it comes and goes.</p><p>- Clav024: &quot;2, normal&quot; - a decent bit of 7, but it takes a couple of seconds to pick it out.  6 and 3 are pretty strong, and there&apos;s plenty of 5.  The inharmonicity down at the fundamental is distracting; so is the birdie.</p><p>- Clav028: &quot;1.5, weak to normal&quot; - I can pick out 7, faintly.  2, 3, and 4 are strong and well balanced.  The birdie&apos;s still having fun. Starting at nine seconds in, what&apos;s with the noise in the guy&apos;s recording equipment that I&apos;ve also heard in several of the others?  Is there an auto-level routine in there trying to compensate for the decrescendo, that late in each tone?</p><p>- Clav032: &quot;1, weak&quot; - I&apos;m not hearing much beyond 1, 2, and 4 after the pluck has died off.  It&apos;s hard to find 3 in this one.  The garbage in there after nine seconds is tiresome.</p><p>- Clav036: &quot;1, weak&quot; - after the first 0.25 second there&apos;s just not much to hear in there anymore but 1, 2, and a whiff of 4.  At nine seconds, it&apos;s not only the chuffing thing but also a pitched beeping!</p><p>- Clav040: &quot;1, weak&quot; - this one has a little more 3 in it than the preceding, but again after the pluck is gone there&apos;s not much to grab but 2 and a little bit of 4.  There&apos;s enough of 5 in there for about one second that I could probably use it to zero a major 3rd or 10th...but it&apos;s getting so faint and transient that I&apos;d be playing the notes repeatedly and often to get it.</p><p>- Clav044: &quot;1, weak&quot; - after two seconds there&apos;s hardly anything left in there but 1 and 2.  Before that I&apos;m hearing some inharmonicity, perhaps a conflict between 2 and 4.  5, 6, and 7 are so negligible in this tone as to be useless.  Not much 3, either.</p><p>- Clav048: &quot;1, weak&quot; - 4 is there only briefly, then it goes away and I hear 2 for about one more second, and then after that there&apos;s not much but 1.  Ping.  The chuffing at the end reminds me of the movie &quot;Contact&quot; where Jodie Foster&apos;s character picks up a signal from outer space.</p><p>- Clav052: &quot;1, weak&quot; - hardly anything but 1 and 2, and then 2 goes away.</p><p>- Clav056: &quot;1, weak&quot; - 1 and 2 have inharmonicity, or maybe it&apos;s 1 with the soundboard.  I hear a whiff of 3, briefly.  And oddly enough, there&apos;s more 5 here (briefly too) than in any of the other samples above Clav040.  But the frequency of 5 is up there where I&apos;m not going to hear much higher than it, usefully.</p><p>And now into the ether go these observations.  I hope it was worth my time.  At least it was interesting.  Time to go tune the semi-brutal virginal from scratch (will probably do a regular 1/5), and then go do one of the Flemishes, and pick out 10 minutes of solo Couperin for a French chamber concert with colleagues.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=75245 href="#75245">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@polettipiano.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2008 11:01:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brad Lehman &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul wrote:<br/>&gt;  &gt; Granted, it is not an Italian, but that is not important.</p><p>&gt; Yes, its being a non-Italian IS that important.

The piano business has<br/>been a cut-throat competition, a snake-oil peddling circus since the<br/>Steinways starting bribing judges in the 1860&apos;s. The &quot;Music Business&quot;<br/>quote often attributed to Hunter S. Thompson (which can be read by<br/>looking at my Yahoo profile) pretty much says it all. Haven&apos;t you read<br/>The Steinway Saga? That&apos;ll cure anyone of such romantic nonsense! The<br/>job of modern piano manufacturers is to SURVIVE, and that means two<br/>things: cutting costs and fighting tooth and nail for the rapidly<br/>diminishing number of potential customers, something which they all do<br/>more or less by spinning fanciful tales about how their instruments<br/>are oh so much better than anyone else&apos;s, while all the time real<br/>quality continues to descend ever more. A friend of mine in the the<br/>Netherlands, a violinist and a piano tuner who is heavily involved in<br/>the movement to make musicians aware of the danger to their hearing<br/>presents by exposure to modern acoustic instruments, recently called<br/>all the manufactures who would talk to him, and the honest ones<br/>actually admitted that all they are trying to do is make their<br/>instruments LOUD, &apos;cause that&apos;s what sells now. &quot;Artistic&quot; is way way<br/>WAY down on the list, believe me...just take a look at the Steinway<br/>website and the horribly kistchy krap they pump out in their 2art<br/>case2 line. THAT&apos;S what builders have to do to stay alive today.</p><p>But in any case, I was talking about the bigger trend in piano design,<br/>which has been to dull it down since about 1830, until VERY recently<br/>when the push to get ever more volume (or the illusion thereof) has<br/>caused them to start introducing a harshness that never would have<br/>been accepted even 60 years ago. They originally dulled it down to<br/>hide the inharmonicty, and now that they are brightening it back up,<br/>there is no miracle cure for the physics of stretched strings made of<br/>semirigid materials.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ll pass your posting around to various friends in the piano<br/>business. You can rest assured you will have brightened their day with<br/>a little comic relief.

I watched the change of<br/>the spectrum as the sound decayed and in every cases tried to found a<br/>sample width and position that accurately represented the sound over<br/>the region that we use for tuning, that is, after the initially<br/>explosion of pluck has calmed down and before the tone has faded to a<br/>near whisper. Actually, it is surprising as to how little the spectral<br/>content changes as it decays. Sometimes partials come and go, as the<br/>spectrograms indicate, and generally the higher partials fade away<br/>leaving only the lower ones, but the FFT images pretty much indicate<br/>what is there to hear over the most useful part of the sound.</p><p>In each case, I have indicated the position of the fundamental<br/>frequency with the red cursor, as in the lower notes it is extremely<br/>weak, essentially absent, because the soundboard does not have<br/>sufficient area to radiate such low frequencies. So when looking at<br/>the spectrograms, remember that in these instances the lowest trace is<br/>NOT the fundamental.</p><p>I have also adjusted the screen view so that the top of the highest<br/>peak for the strongest harmonic is just at the top of the screen. In<br/>all cases, the space between grid lines is 5 dB, so you can easily<br/>judge the relative strengths of harmonics among the different notes.</p><p>Right, now a sample by sample comparison of Brad&apos;s evaluation and the<br/>objective reality.</p><p>- Clav002</p><p>Brad&apos;s analysis:</p><p>&quot;2, normal&quot; - it&apos;s fairly easy to pick out the 7th here and<br/>it&apos;s well-sustained, while the 3rd and 6th harmonics (both playing the<br/>5th degree above the root) are plenty stronger than the 7th is. The<br/>sample becomes useless at the 10-second mark where it pulses with<br/>unnatural noise. The 5th overtone (major 17th) makes its most<br/>noticeable appearance about eight seconds after the pluck.</p><p>The reality:</p><p>Brad&apos;s evaluation of the relative strength of the 7th harmonic is<br/>correct; at - 8 dB from the strongest harmonic (4), it is quite<br/>present, and the fact that its immediate lower and upper neighbors are<br/>slightly weaker makes it easy to hear. His comments about 3 and 6 are<br/>only half right: 3 is stronger and 6 is slightly weaker.</p><p>- Clav007</p><p>Brad&apos;s analysis:</p><p>&quot;1, weak&quot; - the 3rd harmonic is so strong in there that it&apos;s<br/>hard to hear much else, until the 5th one peeks around it after about<br/>six or seven seconds. I can&apos;t hear any useful 7th harmonic in this tone.</p><p>The reality:</p><p>Brad fails miserably on this one. 7 is actually stronger here than in<br/>any other sample, only about 1 dB lower than 3, the strongest. But for<br/>all intents and purposes, there is little difference between 3, 4, 5,<br/>6, and 7, the weakest among them, 5, being only -5 dB. 3 IS the lowest<br/>strong harmonic. Perhaps Brad&apos;s hearing is being mislead by &quot;lowest<br/>component factor&quot;, meaning that the bottom of the stack is always the<br/>easiest to hear without making any effort to focus in on specific<br/>highest elements. 3 also maintains its level a tiny bit longer, though<br/>6 is the clear winner in this aspect.</p><p>In any case, the fact that Brad can&apos;t hear 7 when it is so blatantly<br/>obvious is a troubling indication of the reliability of his hearing in<br/>this respect.</p><p>- Clav011</p><p>Brad&apos;s analysis:</p><p>&quot;1.5, on the weak side of normal&quot; - this tone has so much<br/>inharmonic beating in it by itself, a conflicting resonance at the<br/>soundboard, that it&apos;s hard to pick out much...especially among the odd<br/>harmonics. The 2nd and 4th harmonics (octaves) are so strong and<br/>noticeable, past the inharmonicity, that they pretty much win. I can<br/>hear only a ghost of a 7th in there, and scarcely enough to be useful.</p><p>The Reality:</p><p>Another case where Brad&apos;s perception errs dramatically.</p><p>Strange. 7 is notably less present is this sample than in the<br/>previous, though Brad rates it as MORE present. It is relatively weak<br/>compared to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.</p><p>The most troubling aspects of Brad&apos;s analysis of this sample is his<br/>perception of strong inharmonicty; I haven&apos;t got the foggiest notion<br/>what he is on about here. I&apos;ve done a careful harmonic by harmonic<br/>analysis of this sample, both using very fast FFT at very high<br/>resolution  (running at 96 kHz, 3200 spectral lines, with a frequency<br/>resolution of 0,336 Hz - not the same settings used to make the other<br/>graphs) and aurally listening for beats with individual harmonic<br/>frequencies, and there is absolutely no inharmonicity present in this<br/>sound:</p><p><a href="http://www.polettipiano.com/Temporary/011harmonics.mp3">www.polettipiano.com/Temporary/011harmonics.mp3</a></p><p>(note: if you listen with small computer speakers, you probably won&apos;t<br/>hear the fundamental and the 2nd partial in the first two plucks)</p><p>Each partial is spot-on its proper ratio to the fundamental. This<br/>spetrogram shows a repeated loop of the Clav011 sample with momentary<br/>overdubs of the harmonic series (bright patches) the same as the audio<br/>file except going down through the overtone series:</p><p><a href="http://www.polettipiano.com/Temporary/011inharm?.tiff">www.polettipiano.com/Temporary/011inharm?.tiff</a></p><p>As anyone can see, there is no disagreement.</p><p>Brad: &quot;The 2nd and 4th harmonics (octaves) are so strong and<br/>noticeable, past the inharmonicity, that they pretty much win.&quot;</p><p>3 is actually slightly stronger than 2 and 4, with 5 being between 3<br/>and 2, but for all intents and purposes, there is no difference<br/>between them. Perhaps whatever is causing Brad&apos;s misconception of<br/>inharmonicity is also blocking his ability to hear 3 and 5.</p><p>- Clav015</p><p>Brad&apos;s analysis</p><p>&quot;2, normal&quot; - a decent amount of 7 in there, and a good<br/>balance all around. The strongest harmonic in here, over most of the<br/>sustain, is 2. I can find 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in here without any<br/>problem. What&apos;s with the chirping that starts after about six seconds?</p><p>The reality:</p><p>Very strange. This is the first sample where 7 is truly so much weaker<br/>than the others (-29 dB) that it is essentially absent, and yet Brad<br/>imagines he hears it. The fact that it sits in a hole, being much<br/>lower than the harmonics just below it and just above it, means that<br/>masking pretty much makes it impossible to hear. There is also is a<br/>strong imbalance among the first harmonics, with 3 being noticeably<br/>detenuated compared 1, 2, 4, and 5, despite Brad&apos;s assertion that<br/>there is a &quot;good balance all around.&quot;</p><p>Personal comment: For the life of me, try as I might, I can&apos;t hear 7.<br/>If I pump up the 1 kHz region on a graphic equalizer by +24 dB (7<br/>being about 900 Hz), I can just barely make out 7 for a fleeting<br/>instant abut 6 seconds in. But a 24 dB boost is a LOT.</p><p>- Clav019</p><p>Brad&apos;s analysis:<br/>&quot;1, weak&quot; - the strong 3 and 4 in there pretty much block out<br/>my ability to hear much above them. I can catch a whiff of 5, but it<br/>comes and goes.</p><p>The reality</p><p>Pretty much correct. 2 is actually the strongest, 5 is markedly weaker<br/>at - 30 dB. 7 is actually stronger than both 5 and 6, which should<br/>make it easier to hear than 5, if either can be heard at all.</p><p>- Clav024</p><p>Brad&apos;s analysis</p><p>&quot;2, normal&quot; - a decent bit of 7, but it takes a couple of<br/>seconds to pick it out. 6 and 3 are pretty strong, and there&apos;s plenty<br/>of 5. The inharmonicity down at the fundamental is distracting; so is<br/>the birdie.</p><p>The reality</p><p>More or less correct on the 7. It is actually quite strong, and the<br/>relative absence of lower neighbors make it easy to hear (for me at<br/>least). The oddest and most troubling aspect of Brad&apos;s assertion is<br/>that there is &quot;plenty of 5&quot;, when in reality there is essentially no<br/>5. At 30 dB down from its immediate lower neighbor, masking is going<br/>to make it impossible to hear even though FFT shows that it is vaguely<br/>(in the extreme) present.</p><p>I&apos;m beginning to think that Brad has his own special definition of the<br/>word &quot;inharmonicty&quot;, much as he does with purity, since &quot;inharmonicity<br/>down at the fundamental&quot; is a logical contradiction. Inharmonicty<br/>means that the upper partials are no longer multiples of the<br/>fundamental; inharmonicty &quot;at the fundamental&quot; cannot exist, since it<br/>is THE point of reference by which any upper partial inharmonicty is<br/>determined.</p><p>- Clav028</p><p>Brad&apos;s analysis: &quot;1.5, weak to normal&quot; - I can pick out 7, faintly. 2,<br/>3, and<br/>4 are strong and well balanced.</p><p>The reality</p><p>Regarding 7, it&apos;s more or less correct, but he&apos;s really off the mark<br/>regarding other partials. 4 is in a really big hole, again essentially<br/>not there because of masking from the much stronger 3. I would most<br/>definitely not call it &quot;well balanced&quot;.</p><p>Right. Enough is enough. Anybody who cares to look can carry on with<br/>samples 032 and 036.</p><p>In any case, we&apos;ve seen more than enough to be able to state that<br/>Brad&apos;s hearing is just as often wrong as it is right, perhaps more<br/>often wrong, and at times in some very significant ways. Especially<br/>troubling are the cases of perceived inharmonicty when there is none<br/>and the strong presence of harmonics which are actually absent or<br/>extremely weak. Perhaps the false perception of inharmonicty is due to<br/>a lack of proper use of terminology; now that Brad knows that there is<br/>no true inharmonicty in these samples, maybe he could explain exactly<br/>what the quality is that he perceives as being &quot;inharmonic&quot;.</p><p>The point is that spectral perception is tricky business, and even<br/>those who spend a lot of time trying to consciously do it can be<br/>completely wrong in their judgments. I&apos;ve been honing my skills with a<br/>combined approach of listening and looking with technology for almost<br/>30 years now, so I would like to feel that generally I can make a<br/>pretty good guess. But I also have enough experience to know that &quot;a<br/>pretty good guess&quot; is about as close as one can get. Brad, on the<br/>other hand, seems so cocksure of himself, when actually much of his<br/>judgment is based upon imagination or some kind of internal synthesis,<br/>as process which has been here demonstrated to be completely<br/>untrustworthy. It would behoove him, as it would us all, to realize<br/>that such things can indeed influence our judgments.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3><a id=75297 href="#75297">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2008 2:29:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi ...

I said that I used<br/>an averaging window which best represented the general content of the<br/>sound over the first few seconds after the pluck. More on that point<br/>in a moment. But the thing that I notice right away is how you start<br/>tearing apart the analysis before you&apos;ve even examined the supporting<br/>data. How very open minded and scientific (in the best sense of the<br/>word) of you!</p><p>&gt; but that I was<br/>&gt; explicitly reporting what I hear over the whole 9 seconds (usually) of<br/>&gt; each tone, with the various partials coming or going.</p><p>So that means if a certain partial is there for 8 seconds and then<br/>disappears, you say you can&apos;t hear it? Or if a partial is not there at<br/>all, you say you CAN hear it? I don&apos;t follow...</p><p>&gt; So, we&apos;re not<br/>&gt; measuring the same thing here, at all!</p><p>On the contrary, we ARE measuring the same thing here: whether or not<br/>you can hear what is actually IN the sound at least for a pretty damn<br/>significant portion of its totality.</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re expecting me to have<br/>&gt; snapshotted a freeze-frame of my hearing at not only an isolated point<br/>&gt; within the decay (is that even possible?),</p><p>A red herring, Brad. I&apos;m asking you if you heard something which was<br/>actually there for at least a good 3 or 4 seconds (or in some cases,<br/>showing that you claim you heard something which was NOT there over<br/>the whole time, which right there invalidates your complaint). Your<br/>argument is rather like when the zoo keeper runs up to you holding a<br/>big net and says, &quot;Hey buddy! Did you just see leopard run by here?&quot;,<br/>you answer, &quot;You&apos;re expecting me to have snapshotted a freeze-frame of<br/>my sight at an isolated point within the last few moments!&quot; Actually,<br/>considering the speed at which these samples vary their spectral<br/>content, it more like he asked, &quot;Hey buddy! Did you just see an<br/>elephant go lumbering by here?&quot;</p><p>But as to whether or not it is even within the realm of possibility,<br/>I&apos;d say, yeah, it&apos;s pretty easy. Actually, I do it all the time, but<br/>I&apos;m only a lowly tuner, not an expert in 18th century continuo<br/>realization.</p><p>&gt; but specifically at the<br/>&gt; SAME point you picked as important?!</p><p>Well, as I said in my original post:</p><p>&quot;Actually, it is surprising as to how little the spectral<br/>content changes as it decays.&quot;</p><p>As you say, &quot;one thing I notice right away&quot; is that you neglected to<br/>include that sentence out when you quoted my post. How very convenient<br/>for your argument! And then you accuse ME of cherry picking?! The<br/>juries still out as to whether or not you&apos;ve got ears, Brad, but<br/>you&apos;ve sure got cojones, and big ones, too, I&apos;ll grant you that.</p><p>&gt; And with your &quot;FFT&quot; slides,<br/>&gt; reporting an average, which is certainly impossible for a human ear to<br/>&gt; calculate?</p><p>Um, ah well, do you know what FFT is, Brad? Do you know how it works?<br/>I mean, by definition, periodic oscillation is something that happens<br/>IN TIME (which is what the word &quot;periodic&quot; means), so ANY manner by<br/>which it is perceived or analyzed, human or machine, requires that it<br/>happen OVER TIME, which is what &quot;averaging&quot; is also all about: the<br/>quantification of the accumulation of similar events which occur<br/>within a certain time frame. So, yeah, the human ear does precisely<br/>that. It does it in a different manner, that is by a sort of<br/>bioelectric digitization, or more accurately by running it through a<br/>vast array of narrow bandpass filters and processing the sum total of<br/>their combined outputs into the illusion of a pitch continuum. But it<br/>IS a process which occurs over time, and requires a certain minimum of<br/>time, dare we say a certain number of averages, the size/number of<br/>which depends upon the type of signal and the frequencies contained<br/>therein. FFT does it mathematically, but the result is more or less<br/>the same.</p><p>Me thinks you lack sufficient technical understanding to lodge a valid<br/>complaint against the technological approaches applied here; for<br/>anyone with even a little experience in this field, your complaint has<br/>about as much sophistication as &quot;metal monster with glowing green eyes<br/>belch fire! breath smoke! me no like metal monster!! Kill it!!&quot;</p><p>Go read about FFT, and you will find that within the sort of time<br/>frames we are speaking about, and with signals which vary in spectral<br/>content over time in the manner by which these do, as demonstrated by<br/>the spectrograms, an average of several seconds is precisely THE<br/>method by which one acquires the most accurate representation of the<br/>true nature of the sound as we perceive it.</p><p>Your edited version of my explanation:</p><p>&gt; &quot;The FFT graphs indicate the average of a few seconds of the sound<br/>&gt; just after the intensly-bright transients of the pluck have<br/>&gt; disappeared, say about 1/3 to 1/2 second after the pluck. I watched<br/>&gt; the change of the spectrum as the sound decayed and in every cases<br/>&gt; tried to found a sample width and position that accurately represented<br/>&gt; the sound over the region that we use for tuning, that is, after the<br/>&gt; initially explosion of pluck has calmed down and before the tone has<br/>&gt; faded to a near whisper.&quot;</p><p>So, by stating that this is some arbitrary and useless selection on my<br/>part, you seem to be saying that you use some OTHER portion of the<br/>sound to tune than</p><p>&gt; a few seconds ...<br/>&gt; just after the intensly-bright transients of the pluck have<br/>&gt; disappeared</p><p>This 3 to 4 second &quot;window of opportunity&quot; is the point in the sound I<br/>was taught to listen to as the easiest to hear many a long year ago by<br/>Niel Roberts at the Harpsichord Center in LA. That&apos;s also the part of<br/>the envelope in the sound where I still find it easiest to hear after<br/>more than 30 years of tuning harpsichords, clavichords, and historic<br/>pianos of all shapes and sizes (and organs, too, but they have no<br/>envelope). Judging by the frequency with which other harpsichord<br/>tuners repeat the notes they are tuning, that also the portion of the<br/>envelope they all listen to. That&apos;s also the part of the envelope<br/>where every modern piano tuner I have ever talked to listens. And<br/>finally, that&apos;s also the part of the envelope where my students find<br/>it easiest to pick out overtones, and not because I tell them so,<br/>&apos;cause often I don&apos;t have to tell them anything, they just DO it - or<br/>already know how to do it.</p><p>But then, it wouldn&apos;t surprise me if Brad does something different<br/>from everybody else.</p><p>There are several theoretical explanations for this common practice,<br/>which anyone can more or less see for themselves just by looking at<br/>the spectrograms and seeing how the sound changes over time.<br/>Alternatively, Brad, you could go take remedial Acoustics I and<br/>Psychoacoustics classes, if they offer such at your school. Might<br/>clear up a lot of issues for you.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I&apos;ve certainly learned that it&apos;s possible to be shown &quot;wrong&quot; in<br/>&gt; public by a cherry-picking approach of showing one microsecond, rather<br/>&gt; than the whole lifetime of each tone.</p><p>Mmm, now we&apos;ve compressed 3 seconds out of 9 into 1 microsecond out of<br/>a whole lifetime.</p><p>&gt;  Geez.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for &quot;inharmonicity&quot; in my remarks, when I did your test last<br/>&gt; weekend, I was referring to the way several of the notes were creating<br/>&gt; a beating noise all by themselves, not being played with any other<br/>&gt; simultaneous note.</p><p>Ah, exactly as I posited, evidently you have some special definition<br/>of the word &quot;inharmonicity&quot; with which I am not previously acquainted.<br/>An &quot;inharmonic&quot; tone does not beat by itself; self-beating (might we<br/>call them &quot;flagellants&quot;?) is what is often called a &quot;false string&quot;. I<br/>run into them all the time on fortepianos, especially the big late 6<br/>1/2 octave ones where they are thick as thieves. But that is not<br/>&quot;inharmonicty&quot;, which is something entirely different, both in sound<br/>and what is actually occurring acoustically.</p><p>&gt; The instrument is doing something inharmonious<br/>&gt; that is causing beating.  You didn&apos;t hear that in the ones I reported,<br/>&gt; listening all the way through the 9 seconds?</p><p>Nope, I&apos;m sorry, I can&apos;t say as if I do. Just spent 5 minutes<br/>listening over and over again to 011 and 024 as I said before, I<br/>haven&apos;t got the foggiest notion what you&apos;re on about here. The very<br/>end of some of the samples have some technical problems, but so what?<br/>The majority of the sound is free of any technical glitches which<br/>might confuse the listener. I certainly hear nothing of any sort in<br/>sample 011 which I would characterize as</p><p>&gt;  so much<br/>&gt; inharmonic beating in it by itself, a conflicting resonance at the<br/>&gt; soundboard, that it&apos;s hard to pick out much...especially among the<br/>&gt; odd harmonics.</p><p>I find the tone quite stable and far from exhibiting any sort of<br/>falseness or inharmoncity. I also have absolutely no trouble picking<br/>out the odd harmonics, at least the ones that are present. 3 and 5 are<br/>both very easy to hear, requiring a minimum of focused listening. Of<br/>course, I&apos;ve been tuning historic pianos for so many years now,<br/>perhaps I&apos;ve simply learned to hear beyond any such problems.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, uh, thanks.</p><p>Sounds like you didn&apos;t get much out of the exercise, other than<br/>reinforcing an apparently already strong sense of innate technophobia.</p><p>Oh well, Happy Trails nonetheless.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3><a id=75314 href="#75314">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2008 1:42:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Not sure what Paul is going on about with &apos;Windows&apos;...

Almost by definition, it<br/>doesn&apos;t change in quality or beat against itself.

Thus no frequency shift.</p><p>I can tell you from tuning a lot of fortepianos which have both false<br/>strings and inharmonicty, the one is distinctly different from the<br/>other. With an inharmonic tone, the overall sound appears essentially<br/>stable in amplitude, but it is very active in timbre, changing all the<br/>time and having a distinc metallic quality. When you try to tune it to<br/>an octave (usually the octave above, as the bass is where we find the<br/>most inharmonicty), you find that if you get one partial beatless, say<br/>3, then some other partial is warbling away quit annoyingly, usually 7<br/>for God knows whatever reason. If you stop 7 from beating, then 3 is<br/>warbling. It is impossible to find a tuning where all the harmonics<br/>are beatless, as is possible with most of the rest of the instrument.<br/>Occasionally, one encounters an isolated inharmonic string higher up,<br/>which manifests itself by causing temperament problems. I notice this<br/>because I almost always set the temperament by matching the tones of<br/>the tenor octave to a set of twelve tones produced by the computer,<br/>doing it by ear. Sometimes (usually only with Italian harpsichords),<br/>the individual unison are spot on, and the most careful listening<br/>detects no beats at any unison. Upon checking the fifths, however, a<br/>certain note may beat incorrectly, either way too fast or two slow. So<br/>yo have to tweak it a bit to get the fifths beating in the right<br/>proportion. If you return to the computer and recheck the unison, it<br/>is out of tune slightly. Of course, the fifths in the computer beat at<br/>the correct rates, as my tone generator (Absynth) is accurate to 6<br/>decimal places. Luckily, I have only encountered this problem in a few<br/>Italians harpsichords and Erard pianos of the 1840&apos;s, which are famous<br/>for having a nasty little area of inharmonicity just below a frame<br/>break in the scale. But in any event, I always check the temperament<br/>by ear after matching the unisons to the computer.</p><p>But anyway, here&apos;s some samples I whipped up years ago to demonstrate<br/>inharmonicity.

I don&apos;t see any caveat anywhere on this page (nor<br/>anywhere else in the entire website, which has some pretty damn<br/>thorough discussions of wind instrument acoustics) that either states<br/>or implies that bowed strings and winds have harmonic spectra &quot;only in<br/>the limited case when the musicians maintain precisely the same<br/>dynamic level.&quot;</p><p>Let me put it to you one final way. I can call up the spectrum window<br/>in Absynth, and while a tone is sounding, I can increase or decrease<br/>the amplitude of any of the individual harmonics in real time, without<br/>having to pause the tone and star over again. Now if I made a<br/>recording of this process, the wave form would be changing all the<br/>time, but personally, I don&apos;t know ANYBODY who would ever say that I<br/>was making a sounds which were inharmonic.

But I am<br/>looking for a meaningful acoustic definition, not one that relies on<br/>the properties of pianos that Paul has prodded. We know what<br/>&apos;inharmonicity&apos; means in piano-tuner jargon, but does it make<br/>scientific sense.</p><p>First he said that a harmonic sound has partials at multiples of the<br/>fundamental frequency. But if you take a 100Hz sinewave (let&apos;s say the<br/>2nd harmonic of 50Hz) and amplitude modulate it at 2Hz, you get<br/>partials at 98 and 102 Hz. All of these cannot be multiples of one<br/>fundamental.</p><p>&quot;The term &grave;false beat&apos;4 (&grave;falseness&apos;) is a standard part of piano<br/>tuning terminology, and refers to a beat pattern that is often present<br/>in the decay curve of one or more audible partial tones5 of a single<br/>string, indicating that the audible partial is not radiated from a<br/>single normal mode, but from a *mode pair* close in frequency. Such a<br/>pair would occur within the mode frequency series that is *otherwise*<br/>approximately harmonic (except for some inharmonic dispersion due to<br/>string stiffness).&quot; (Capleton, emphasis added.)</p><p>Now Paul wants to say that the perceived frequency of each component,<br/>where &apos;component&apos; means something not yet clear, perhaps<br/>&apos;thing-sounding-to-me-as-if-it-were-a-partial&apos;, must be a multiple of<br/>the fundamental. Maybe you can make a reasonable working definition<br/>out of that too, if the components are well-behaved enough.</p><p>As to sounds with partials that gradually increase or decrease in<br/>intensity, it does make sense to allow them to be harmonic, *if* the<br/>intensity variations are such that they just smear out the spectrum of<br/>each partial (e.g. Breit-Wigner lineshape, for an exponential decay)<br/>rather than shifting or splitting it into separate parts. After all a<br/>spectrum can never be measured to infinite precision.</p><p>My suspicion is that the basic property I want is the phase<br/>relationships of the partials. If they do not shift relative to each<br/>other over several periods of the fundamental, the sound is harmonic<br/>and the features in the shape of the waveform do not shift forwards or<br/>backwards relative to each other.</p><p>Clearly anything with &apos;false&apos; or &apos;real&apos; beats (acoustically almost the<br/>same thing!) has appreciable relative phase shifts of partials.</p><p>By the way, for some reason my RealPlayer didn&apos;t accept Paul&apos;s &apos;mild&apos;<br/>mp3 file. The others (&apos;intense&apos; and &apos;intense-2X8ve&apos;) worked fine.<br/>~~~T~~~</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Poletti&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If a &quot;component&quot; is &quot;split&quot; into two theoretical components supposedly<br/>&gt; causing the beating, then the perceived frequency is their average,<br/>&gt; which is the same as the original frequency.
