Paul you would<br/>be a great teacher... sign me up for Xenharmonics 401 anyday... (on-line or<br/>desk-line)  Pay real money, too...</p><p>One other *fearless* dumb question... if fifths in Pythagorean are all<br/>*pure*, why does this &apos;multiple naming&quot; happen??  Is it a naming convention<br/>and the &quot;second time&quot; the fifths go around in the spiral  (due to the<br/>Pythagorean comma) they are called something else??...   am I getting the<br/>drift or just drifting.</p><p>(Oui or wee-wee? -- just wanted to have Jerry laugh again...)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=8609 href="#8609">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The naming convention for both Pythagorean and meantone tunings<br/>takes the chain of fifths as:</p><p>...Fbb-Cbb-Gbb-Dbb-Abb-Ebb-Bbb-Fb-Cb-Gb-Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-D<br/>#-A#-E#-B#-F##-C##-G##-D##-A##-E##-B##...</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, moving twelve fifths to the right along this chain<br/>leads to a pitch rise of a Pythagorean comma; in meantone tuning, moving<br/>twelve fifths to the right along this chain leads to a pitch drop of a<br/>diesis.</p></div>
