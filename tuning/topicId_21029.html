Or try singing them.</p><p>Then, my question for 12-tet perfect pitch musicians - do the<br/>7/1 etc partials sound &quot;out of tune&quot;.</p><p>Or, do they just sound out of tune as separate notes, but somehow okay<br/>as part of the cello voice? If so, why? I imagine they must, as the<br/>partials of a cello are really loud, - a loud solo cello would have<br/>partials as strong as many instruments in the orchestra. So, say<br/>in a cello concerto, if one heard the partials of the cello as<br/>out of tune, they would really stand out. But musicians with 12-tet<br/>perfect pitch apparently aren&apos;t bothered by this. I wonder why not?</p><p>Maybe doesn&apos;t apply to any on the list, or just those who have<br/>come to microtonal music recently from 12-tet. However, could try<br/>it out with your friends, and see what they say?</p><p>Here is a fractal tune with the cello playing in pentatonic 12-tet,<br/>and above it, recorder playing selections from the first 25 partials<br/>of each cello note, plus some percussion.<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/partials/cello_with_partials.mid">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/partials/cello_with_partials.mid</a></p><p>I suppose one would have to say it is in 12-tet.</p><p>However, I think one would notice if the pitches of the higher partials<br/>of the cellos in an orchestra were as noticeable as this!</p><p>Also perhaps gives one some idea of what 12-tet would sound like<br/>to someone who had never heard it before, and was used to just intonation<br/>- very strange I imagine. (Though probably fascinating too, in a way<br/>we can&apos;t quite imagine.)</p><p>I have feeling we would notice the partials more if not so used to 12-tet.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=21031 href="#21031">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2001 1:18:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>Sorry. did this one with midi cut off of a minute, so here it is again:</p><p><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/partials/cello_c2_partials.mid">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/partials/cello_c2_partials.mid</a></p><p>Robert</p></div>
