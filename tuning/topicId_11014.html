But unlike many instruments, there&apos;s nothing particularly<br/>hard to synthesize in the Chromelodeon.  It may be that nobody&apos;s ever<br/>taken the time...</p><p>David Beardsley...<br/>&gt;Maybe a job for physical modeling? - it&apos;s worth a try.</p><p>The timbre of the instrument succumbs quite readily to additive.  To<br/>satisfy Wolf, and perhaps simulate varying air pressure, it&apos;s a matter<br/>of mapping some MIDI control vectors to some envelope and filter stuff,<br/>and having enough polyphony for the job.</p><p>As to the general question of the substitution, we may ask which, if not<br/>both, would be objectionable to Partch: 1. the substitution of a stock<br/>synth for economic reasons, and 2. substituion of a custom synth setup<br/>for whatever reason.  Most learned collegues, I humbly suggest that the<br/>person who debates such questions has mis-understood Partch on a very<br/>fundamental level.  If Harry&apos;s work lives only as a part of a concert<br/>cycle, it&apos;s a great loss.  Partch&apos;s work makes for us a much greater<br/>challenge -- one we may not choose to accept, one we may not even hear.<br/>There&apos;s no shame either way.  Partch asks nothing of us, but he does<br/>challenge us.  And if we claim to accept the challenge, then it means<br/>making art from our souls -- &quot;just like early man&quot; -- and making life<br/>an art in the same spirit.  It&apos;s rather revolutionary, really.  It means<br/>new work.  All the time.  And if somebody performs Partch with a DX-7, let<br/>somebody else perform it with a Chromelodeon.  If somebody transcribes<br/>Partch for string quartet, let somebody else transcribe a string quartet<br/>for Partch ensemble (but don&apos;t attend either of those concerts!)</p><p>&quot;The world is round.&quot; - Gertrude Stein<br/>&quot;The world is wrong.&quot; - Harry Partch</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=11043 href="#11043">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2000 5:21:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;MIDI control vectors???
