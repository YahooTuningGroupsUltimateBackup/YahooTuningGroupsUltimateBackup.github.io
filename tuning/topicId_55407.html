I was rather shocked to find that he basically derives the 12-tET scale from JI principles -- in fact, that the 5-limit just chromatic scale that he derives is identical to the one that Partch derives in Genesis (ignoring the F-sharp/G-flat conundrum, which Partch resolves arbitrarily and which Hindemith politely ignores).  It makes me wonder, ultimately, if Hindemith&apos;s &quot;Craft&quot; couldn&apos;t be extrapolated to a higher prime limit.<br/>   Of course, life gets difficult right away, since any JI system is going to provide a much higher number of unique intervals than 12-tET.  Hindemith classifies the 12-tET intervals in terms of their relative dissonance -- and since he&apos;s only got 11 intervals to classify (not counting octave and unison), it&apos;s a short list.  Then, he classifies all harmonies according to their interval content.  I can&apos;t even imagine what an interval list for Partch&apos;s Monophonic Fabric would look like... and then you have to take into account false consonances, etc.  Then, the chord classification scheme that follows would be monumental... and probably not worth the time...<br/>   It seems like some sort of Grand Unifying Theory is possible, but it would take some serious man-hours to find...
