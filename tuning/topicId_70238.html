Plus, like I said, I *strongly* disagree that<br/>all microtonalists are interested solely in strange novelty, or making<br/>provocative new sounds. This leaves out historical tunings which may<br/>or may not sound strange to modern ears, or folks who might write in<br/>traditional ways in, say 31-eq, for the increased beauty of<br/>consonance.

It&apos;s accurately<br/>describing the search for accuracy of pitch. To be accurate about<br/>pitch and it&apos;s musical effects, you are concerned by definition with<br/>the smallest inflections, even if you are dealing with larger steps<br/>(e.g. 7-equal), b/c you seek to locate these pitches on a continuum,<br/>which means you are being sensitive to micro-changes in pitch. It<br/>doesn&apos;t have to be at all about referencing 12-equal, although that&apos;s<br/>often helpful to bring up, b/c it&apos;s a de-facto tuning standard that<br/>people are swimming in al the time.</p><p>Any comments?</p><p>-A.</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2007 11:24:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:aaron@dividebypi.com">aaron@dividebypi.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 05 Mart 2007 Pazartesi 20:02<br/>Subject: [tuning] more thoughts about the term &apos;microtonal&apos;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;microtonal&apos;....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) It&apos;s the term where most of the outside world would already know<br/>&gt; what you mean.

Why adopt snobbish classicism to appease<br/>the masses? For all we know, prejudiced people will think Maqam Music to be<br/>&quot;out of tune&quot; no matter how much &quot;13-limit consonance&quot; one might try to<br/>ascribe to the genre. There is no need to promote populism on the alternate<br/>tuning list, and no need to ingratiate die-hard twelve-toners out there.</p><p>&gt; 2) How many software or hardware products do you think will adopt<br/>&gt; another term? you see a music product &apos;MicroVST&apos;, you immediately get<br/>&gt; a sense of what it&apos;s about---allowing or enabling tuning capabilities.<br/>&gt; Even if a small community adopted a new term, it&apos;s highly unlikely<br/>&gt; that the standard terminology will go away.

I think 99% of people would respond to that term<br/>&gt; like you were a snob, a weirdo, or a sideshow turnoff. All these are<br/>&gt; bad for this community.</p><p>Bad for economy too.</p><p>Plus, like I said, I *strongly* disagree that<br/>&gt; all microtonalists are interested solely in strange novelty, or making<br/>&gt; provocative new sounds.</p><p>Someone is likely to get provoked no matter how hard we try.</p><p>This leaves out historical tunings which may<br/>&gt; or may not sound strange to modern ears, or folks who might write in<br/>&gt; traditional ways in, say 31-eq, for the increased beauty of<br/>&gt; consonance.

As a case in point, a 31-tET rendering of existing Baroque<br/>music surely is not microtonal!</p><p>&gt; 4) When you think about the &apos;micro&apos; part is spot-on. It&apos;s accurately<br/>&gt; describing the search for accuracy of pitch.</p><p>No! Tuning is. Micro focuses on fixed steps smaller than either the semitone<br/>or the whole tone (viz. in between the first and the latter), accuracy of<br/>pitch is a secondary issue for microtonality IMHO.</p><p>To be accurate about<br/>&gt; pitch and it&apos;s musical effects, you are concerned by definition with<br/>&gt; the smallest inflections, even if you are dealing with larger steps<br/>&gt; (e.g. 7-equal), b/c you seek to locate these pitches on a continuum,<br/>&gt; which means you are being sensitive to micro-changes in pitch.</p><p>I was thinking, rather, that in microtonality, one starts with a predefined<br/>system of tuning where there are &quot;quarter-tones&quot; and &quot;middle seconds&quot; that<br/>don&apos;t change in size. Utilization of such steps makes the music microtonal,<br/>not the tuning itself if it lets you compose with semitones and wholetones<br/>alone. 7 and 9 equal are valid exceptions, where there are no tones or<br/>semitones in the classical sense, and one is forced to use a &quot;middle second&quot;<br/>interval as the smallest step.</p><p>It<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t have to be at all about referencing 12-equal, although that&apos;s<br/>&gt; often helpful to bring up, b/c it&apos;s a de-facto tuning standard that<br/>&gt; people are swimming in al the time.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I will insist that microtonal is music based on distinctive &quot;quarter-tone&quot;<br/>or &quot;middle second&quot; steps between the prime and semitone &amp; semitone and whole<br/>tone. 31, 43, 53, or 55 are not any more microtonal if those steps are not<br/>used, but remain tuning systems/temperaments available for microtonality<br/>nonetheless.</p><p>&gt; Any comments?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -A.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2007 12:42:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot; &lt;aaron@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Any comments?</p><p>I like the name of my web site.
