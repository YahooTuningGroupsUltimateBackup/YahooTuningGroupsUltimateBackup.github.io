This makes conditions in which children are<br/>reared, from the prenatal stage to adolescence, more crucial because<br/>(as with height) an interaction of genes and environment, not genes<br/>alone, produces potential as well as developed intelligence....&quot;</p><p>_________ ______ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
