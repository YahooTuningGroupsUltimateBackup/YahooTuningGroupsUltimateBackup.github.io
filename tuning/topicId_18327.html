He didn&apos;t recognize<br/>me, even though a year earlier he was reminiscing about me to his buddy Radu<br/>Stan in the Salabert offices.  But a year later, Xenakis&apos; most recent<br/>composition, premiered by conductor Bornstein, was for brass and in a most<br/>tonal &quot;non-Xenakisian&quot; harmony.  It was sweet with consonance.  I thought,<br/>and shared my feelings with close friends that he was seriously ill.</p><p>What is less anecdotal is my 2 hour stay at his home in Paris in 1985.  I had<br/>called him on the telephone and he said come on over.  Without resource of<br/>instrument or recordings we talked as if we were on the same wave length.<br/>How I had hoped for a solo work by the great European master.  He was always<br/>my favorite for France.  At that time Xenakis was planning a Mayan excursion<br/>to Mexico.  It was the phase for him at the time.  Afterwards I long thought<br/>it superb that we both lived in walkup apartments in big cities.  No<br/>elevators, and he had 2 floors at the top of the building.</p><p>Xenakis was a man who was real, who stood by convictions, who was a brilliant<br/>polymath, who harnessed improvisation in stochasticism, who deepened the<br/>ear&apos;s journey through sound, who was in complete command of technology, who<br/>was the premier architect of both the tangible and intangible, and who was a<br/>generous educator in all parts of the world.</p><p>His interest did not lie in just intonation.  Rather, Xenakis - who thought<br/>the explosive sounds he heard in his bombed village the most &quot;beautiful&quot;<br/>sounds he ever heard - plotted quartertones and the glissandi the combines<br/>them.</p><p>One of my favorite moments was conducting his octet &quot;Anaktoria&quot; on an AFMM<br/>concert.  What a wonderful work - &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; in Greek.  He possessed<br/>theater, mass, delicacy, virtuosity, a plot.  In short, he will be sorely<br/>missed.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
