Pehrson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       I&apos;ll have to look at these other systems eventually. But what<br/>I was<br/>&gt; trying to say is if<br/>&gt;    all the notes had a cent value (and a octave number) ,  2-0100<br/>for<br/>&gt; example, would be<br/>&gt;    octave 2, the C#.  Then this designation could be used for any<br/>format. In<br/>&gt; other words<br/>&gt;    if someone sets up 15 EDO with 3 groups of 5 lines and someone<br/>else does<br/>&gt; something<br/>&gt;    totally different, the software could in theory, take one and<br/>convert to<br/>&gt; the other.<br/>&gt;       I suppose my comments are based on more ignorance than<br/>knowledge. Do<br/>&gt; you at<br/>&gt;    least see where I&apos;m coming from in this message?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Stephen Szpak<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Why sure, that&apos;s understandable.  But, we live in the present, and<br/>I thought you were interested in finding a decent notation for 15-EDO<br/>*right now...*  Dave Keenan gave you some excellent suggestions and<br/>the alternative is the more scale-directed (and<br/>less &quot;generalized&quot;) &quot;Porcupine&quot; that Herman Miller came up with...</p><p>J. Pehrson</p><p>    J. Pehrson</p><p>   My computer is so slow I&apos;m just trying to save all these messages so I never lose them.<br/>   I haven&apos;t had time to check out Dave Keenan&apos;s suggestion as yet.  This all started as you<br/>   remember, with my original question as to whether notation for 15 EDO had already been<br/>   standardized. It has not been standardized.<br/>    I beliveve I have come up  with a decent notation for 15 EDO, but of course<br/>   no one else has my own idea.  Since there is no &quot;standard&quot; and my 15 EDO notation will<br/>   probably always be used by me alone, my primary concern now is readability.  Can I easily<br/>   understand what I&apos;m doing in my stuff. My idea is not proprietary, but everyone has their own<br/>   concepts.</p><p>  Stephen Szpak</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Make your home warm and cozy this winter with tips from MSN House &amp; Home.  <a href="http://special.msn.com/home/warmhome.armx">http://special.msn.com/home/warmhome.armx</a></p></div><h3><a id=50308 href="#50308">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2003 3:50:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Stephen Szpak&quot; &lt;stephen_szpak@h...&gt;</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_50307.html#50307">/tuning/topicId_50307.html#50307</a></p><p> My idea is not proprietary, but<br/>&gt; everyone has their own<br/>&gt;     concepts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Stephen Szpak<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Hi Stephen,</p><p>Well, I believe you&apos;ve learned something significant about<br/>microtonality since coming on this list:  there are no &quot;standards...&quot;</p><p>WHOOPIE, BONZO, WOZO, CARRAMBA!</p><p>But, that can be a liability as much as an asset.
