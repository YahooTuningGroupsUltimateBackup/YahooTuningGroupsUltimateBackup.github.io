I think they should. Though only professionals need to. Those<br/>&gt; into microtonal music as a hobby [not for a career]can make the music that<br/>&gt; most satisfies them. That stands for academic composers relying on grants<br/>&gt; too [although grant proposals are also subject to the whims and fancies of<br/>&gt; patrons]. People who would like to make money  or a living from microtonal<br/>&gt; music have to consider things like markets. Am I not allowed to make<br/>&gt; suggestions for the benefit of those people ?<br/>&gt;</p><p>There are outlets for &apos;experimental&apos; music to be commercially viable. This<br/>may be film and TV scoring (all the twentieth century experiments are fair<br/>game AS LONG AS PEOPLE DON&apos;T REALLY HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT). Or, slap on some<br/>loud enough 4/4-120 so that it is danceable. Or (and I anticipate that this<br/>would be less successful), have some pouty MTV princess sing over it,<br/>especially if the simultaneous imagery is sexual and/or violently oriented<br/>to appeal to the adolescent male in all of us.</p><p>It may well be possible to have a &apos;big-time microtonal music career&apos; using<br/>techniques like the above (as it is possible in any art to &apos;wedge ones<br/>thing&apos; into the industry with varying amounts of honesty and payback).</p><p>Most &apos;fringe&apos; artists (those who would finish a &apos;wedged&apos; work and feel<br/>dissatisfied with the results due to the compromises required to make the<br/>&apos;wedge&apos;), have to settle for smaller audiences, smaller paychecks, and<br/>will survive despite the industry.</p><p>Ives had a day job. Nowadays, we can communicate (find our audience of<br/>500) on the internet) and self-produce works of pretty spectacular<br/>quality at fairly small expense.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3>Paul H.
