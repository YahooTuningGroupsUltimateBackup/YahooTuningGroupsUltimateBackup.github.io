He saw no reason to go &quot;Harry&apos;s route&quot; of writing instruments for his sole ensemble when he realized that there were already a myriad of microtonal ensembles everywhere. these being gamelan enesembles. So he wrote much music<br/>that could be done on ANY Pelog or ANY Slendro. His works are actually performed quite a bit. At one point i heard he was the most performed living american composer in the world.<br/>    he had also remarked that he perferred writing for gamelan ensembles because it actually gave him more parts to compose as he found he would always run out of instruments when he wrote for the big western warhorse. The reason he titled his fourth sym his last symphony is cause he did not want to have to write for it again. the piece that<br/>i mentioned before , the Concerto for Piano with Javanese Gamelan, he wrote immediately after the one he wrote for Keith Jarrett as his way of releasing as he said &quot;the real concerto he wanted to write&quot;. His use of Kirnberger was his compromise instrument and all the 12 ET music was written on a piano tuned to this and he just &quot;let them<br/>perform it in 12 ET&quot; although this is what he heard. It is interesting to note that Stravinsky&apos;s pino seemed totally out of tune to Robert Craft who attempted to have it fixed but was sternly stooped by igor in doing so.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2003 10:02:14 +0000<br/>&gt;    From: Alison Monteith &lt;<a href="mailto:alison.monteith3@which.net">alison.monteith3@which.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Kraig.
