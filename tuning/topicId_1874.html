Aside from that, I find it a<br/>&gt;bit presumptuous that sufficient commitment was assumed for the word<br/>&gt;&quot;renege&quot; to be used in the first place.</p><p>I never thought of &quot;renege&quot; as a necessarily strong word. I would apply<br/>it to idle conversation. Sorry if I misused it in a way that blew the<br/>importance of any of this out of proportion. If I appear to get<br/>vitriolic on the list sometimes, I&apos;m sorry; Paul, I think of you as a<br/>kindred spirit since we think so much alike (and have the same name :)<br/>and I really enjoy these intellectual discussions -- if I was hurtful, I<br/>hope you can think of it as a boxing match between friends. Maybe my<br/>tone on this list comes from that of Harry Partch in _Genesis_, which<br/>was my primary influence and some of whose ideas I like to defend with<br/>the same fervor as Harry himself.</p><p>&gt;&gt;                                             But there does appear to<br/>be<br/>&gt;&gt; a conflict between your/Manuel&apos;s algorithm and using all odd<br/>composites,<br/>&gt;&gt; as my 9:5 vs. 11:5 example pointed out.</p><p>&gt;No, there isn&apos;t.  (Sheesh!  I don&apos;t remember the last time I&apos;ve had to<br/>&gt;argue so hard to convince someone I agreed with him.  Though I have a<br/>&gt;feeling that it was Paul E. that time, too. 8-)&gt; )</p><p>Yeah, that was me, and we still have to come back to that discussion at<br/>a later date.</p><p>But let&apos;s look at the algorithm you posted on Fri, 12 Mar 1999 10:30:47<br/>(TD 95, message 12), which is what I was referring to:</p><p>&gt;I have in fact found a<br/>&gt;simpler algorithm, though I think Manuel has beaten me to it already,<br/>&gt;since it sounds like he has already coded it up.  Nevertheless, here it<br/>&gt;is, for the curious:</p><p>&gt;Given a Fokker-style interval vector (I1, I2, . . . In):</p><p>&gt;1.  Go to the rightmost nonzero exponent; add the product of its<br/>&gt;absolute value with the log of its base to the total.</p><p>&gt;2.  Use that exponent to cancel out as many exponents of the opposite<br/>&gt;sign as possible, starting to its immediate left and working right;<br/>&gt;discard anything remaining of that exponent.</p><p>&gt;&#x9;Example: starting with, say, (4 2 -3), we would add 3 lg(7)</p><p>&gt;[....]</p><p>The rest of the post dealt only with these 3-component (3,5,7) vectors.<br/>Now a Fokker-style vector implies (to me) one with an entry for each<br/>prime above 2. Manuel in fact referred to primes in his post on the<br/>algorithm. Now I admit that you did not specifically mention primes; as<br/>your examples only went up to 7, there&apos;s no way to know whether you<br/>meant primes or odds. But another reason I assumed you meant primes is<br/>that if you meant odds, you would need an additional step in the<br/>algorithm where the user specifies the odd limit (dimensionality) of the<br/>lattice. That step is clearly needed to apply the algorithm<br/>unambiguously. As the prime-based complexity measures do not require<br/>this step, I proposed an interpretation where the dimensionality was<br/>infinite, and the complexity of the interval turns out to be just the<br/>(log of the) odd limit of the interval. But that makes the whole lattice<br/>kind of superfluous and I would definitely prefer a means of limiting<br/>the dimensionality. Unfortunately, that cannot be done from the ratios<br/>themselves; a 9:5 could occur as a secondary interval if the odd limit<br/>is 5, or a primary interval if the odd limit is 9 or higher. So the<br/>dimensionality of the lattice must also be specified.</p><p>&gt;Okay.  The 11-limit prime vectors for 9:5 and 11:5 are (2 -1 0 0) and<br/>&gt;(0 -1 0 1).  Converting these to the optimal 11-limit odd-factor<br/>vectors<br/>&gt;as described above, we get (0 -1 0 1 0) for 9:5 and (0 -1 0 0 1) for<br/>&gt;11:5.</p><p>You didn&apos;t mention any such conversion in the post I quoted above, which<br/>appeared to be an exposition of your algorithm. You see why I thought we<br/>disagreed?</p><p>&gt;Incidentally, since you don&apos;t like the 225:224 example, let&apos;s just<br/>&gt;consider the 9:5 within the traditional 5-limit (vector [2 -1]).  With<br/>&gt;your largest-odd-factor method, we get lg(9).  However, the shortest<br/>&gt;path through the 5-limit lattice for 9:5 is a 3:2 and a 6:5, or<br/>&gt;lg(3) + lg(5).  Eh?</p><p>I think we both understand now that both are the right answer, under<br/>different specifications of the dimensionality of the lattice. Right?</p><p>Manuel mentioned primes, not odds; and did not mention a step which<br/>specifies the dimensionality of the lattice. So I&apos;m pretty sure my<br/>objections still apply to his algorithm. Since you appeared to agree<br/>with his algorithm, I included you as one of the authors of the<br/>algorithm I disagreed with. Sorry if I misinterpreted you.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
