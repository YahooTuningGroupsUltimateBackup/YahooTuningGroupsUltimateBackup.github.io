And while I<br/>was sleepily trying to chew into what felt like a very hard raisin or<br/>date, one of my teeth shattered. In a panic I spit out the half-mawed<br/>remains of the trail mix and what used to be my tooth (which now<br/>consisted of one big whiteish hunk and a bunch of old filling stuff -<br/>it looked an awful lot like welding slag). When I stumbled into the<br/>bathroom and looked into the mirror I only saw what my tongue had<br/>already told me; all that remained was some truly hideous needle-like<br/>stalagtite... I took three sleeping pills and hit the sack in the<br/>hopes that it would all go away. It didn&apos;t all go away.</p><p>However, by the grace of some divine intervention it also didn&apos;t fully<br/>expose a nerve, and today I&apos;m (at least as far as I know) not much<br/>worse for wear. Of course at this point any sane or reasonably<br/>sensible person would probably wonder why the Hell I didn&apos;t, or don&apos;t,<br/>go<br/>to the dentist... they just wouldn&apos;t understand.</p><p>The fact is that I haven&apos;t been to a dentist in some thirteen plus<br/>years, and while this is tied into the perpetual lack of coins (which<br/>in this case means no health or dental insurance), that&apos;s not quite<br/>the whole story (as I have at various interment times had dental<br/>insurance)...</p><p>When I was twenty-two years old or so, my mothers live in auto<br/>mechanic boyfriend Duke (AKA, Dave) arranged a deal with one of his<br/>customers who was a dentist: he (Duke) would fix his (AKA, Dr. Mike)<br/>Harley Davidson in<br/>exchange for a mouthful of dental work on his girlfriends (AKA, my<br/>mother) inept son (AKA, me).</p><p>So one Sunday morning, me, Duke, Dr. Mike and what I&apos;m all but sure<br/>was his one night stand from the previous evening, all illegally sneak<br/>into the dentist office<br/>that (for reasons unfathomable to me) employs Dr. Mike. Whatever else<br/>might have occurred over the course of the next three hours, only two<br/>things remain clear... 1) me valiantly struggling not to swallow my<br/>tongue while Dr. Mike valiantly struggled to wedge my mouth open with<br/>something that resembled and old doorstop, and 2) Dr. Mike&apos;s<br/>&quot;assistant&quot; -- his booze-breathed female companion (whom I&apos;m imagining<br/>along with Dr. Mike is still up from the night before) -- distortedly<br/>leering in at my prolonged near death experience.</p><p>It took about three days for the swelling to recede to the point where<br/>I was no longer mistaking myself for The Lady in The Radiator...</p><p>They say, &quot;what doesn&apos;t kill you makes you stronger.&quot; I don&apos;t know, I<br/>guess what didn&apos;t kill me didn&apos;t kill me, but I sure as Hell don&apos;t see<br/>that as any guarantee that it won&apos;t next time!</p><p>While I was on the phone and in the middle of blabbing away on this<br/>story with my friend Pete, I was simultaneously scribbling away on the<br/>back of an envelope when I suddenly noticed that when you take an<br/>overtone sequence as say n...2n-1, the undertone sequence, i.e.,<br/>2n-1...n, will also be the superparticular ratios in the guise of a<br/>consecutive integer sequence where their sum is e, i.e., n-EDO. So<br/>where n = 4 for instance, 4:5:6:7 becomes the 7, 13, 18, and 22 in 22e<br/>where 7/22 = 5/4, 6/22 = 6/5, 5/22 = 7/6, and 4/22 = 8/7...</p><p>Ah well, as always, your beleaguered colleague in life,<br/>Dan</p><p>p.s. &quot;The Lady in The Radiator&quot; was a reference to the exaggeratedly<br/>puffy-cheeked lady in David Lynch&apos;s ERASERHEAD. Ray Wolfe has a nice<br/>page on the movie in which he sort of symbolically sums it all up for<br/>me (well as I&apos;m seeing it today anyway) pretty well... &quot;One of the<br/>best scenes in the entire film is when Mary leaves Henry. She walks<br/>over to the bed (while Henry is in it) and starts pulling at the<br/>footboard. She looks like she is behind bars or in prison trying to<br/>get out. After what seems like an eternity, we find that she was<br/>simply trying to get the suitcase out from under the bed.&quot;</p></div><h3>Paul H.
