I&apos;ve been trying to understand and deal<br/>with higher limit notes, 11 &amp; 13 really, and I have<br/>some questions and observations that I&apos;d like response<br/>about.</p><p>First off, Jon Catler&apos;s music is how I&apos;m most familiar<br/>with 13-limit.  I&apos;m not too familiar with other uses<br/>of 13, or with real world uses in traditional musics.<br/>Jon says that because partials 8-16 are nature&apos;s first<br/>full scale, that completely supports the use of 13<br/>prime limit.  From my understanding, that&apos;s an<br/>erroneous rational.  13-limit may be fine but at least<br/>to my ear it has nothing to do with partials 8-16<br/>being any sort of more significant scale than many<br/>other lower prime scales.</p><p>As for 11-limit, my ear tells me that 11/8 is<br/>interesting but not really particularly consonant.<br/>I&apos;m not sure how I&apos;d use it, at least not against 1/1.<br/> 11/6 seems a little more usable to my ear.  And then<br/>11/9 seems very consonant and usable.  In fact, my ear<br/>says 11/9 is noticeably more consonant than any other<br/>neutral third.<br/>So strangely enough, my ear says that 9:11 and then<br/>6:11 are the most usable 11-limit harmonies, does that<br/>make sense to you guys?  what are the most common uses<br/>of 11-limit?</p><p>Now, 13-limit I don&apos;t get as much.  I hear it in Jon<br/>Catler&apos;s recordings and it sound fine, but when I go<br/>and listen carefully to different notes, I&apos;m not sure<br/>what to think of 13-limit notes.</p><p>Here&apos;s one main thing: I think I&apos;d rather have 44/27<br/>than 13/8 because they sound almost identical to me<br/>when compared to 1/1, at least as far as what feeling<br/>they portray.  44/27 is the 11/9 of 4/3 and I hear<br/>much more difference between 13/8 and 44/27 when<br/>paired with 4/3 than I do with 1/1.  I haven&apos;t found<br/>any place where 13 seems to give me a new feeling not<br/>already defined by another note, and somehow 13<br/>doesn&apos;t sound really any more in-tune to me either.<br/>What am I missing?</p><p>-Aaron</p><p>__________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!

From my understanding, that&apos;s an<br/>&gt;erroneous rational.  13-limit may be fine but at least<br/>&gt;to my ear it has nothing to do with partials 8-16<br/>&gt;being any sort of more significant scale than many<br/>&gt;other lower prime scales.</p><p>This seems like a correct evaluation.</p><p>&gt;As for 11-limit, my ear tells me that 11/8 is<br/>&gt;interesting but not really particularly consonant.</p><p>11:4 is more consonant, as in a Partchian 4:5:6:7:9:11<br/>hexad.  But 11:8 sounds good to me, too.</p><p>Usually the higher-limit harmonies benefit from the<br/>presence of supporting lower-limit harmonies.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not sure how I&apos;d use it, at least not against 1/1.<br/>&gt;11/6 seems a little more usable to my ear.</p><p>11:6 approximates a diatonic major 7th, which may be<br/>why you find it more palpable than 11:8, which is<br/>very foreign to our ears, or may sound like a tritone,<br/>which is a the greatest dissonance in diatonic music.</p><p>&gt;And then 11/9 seems very consonant and usable.  In<br/>&gt;fact, my ear says 11/9 is noticeably more consonant<br/>&gt;than any other neutral third.</p><p>Neutral thirds bother me, but 11:9 is definitely the<br/>most consonant of them.</p><p>&gt;what are the most common uses of 11-limit?</p><p>Very little use has been made of the 11-limit in<br/>polyphonic music.  Partch, and after him Denny<br/>Genovese, and Prent Rodgers, found 11 in the<br/>&quot;tonality diamond&quot;.</p><p>David Doty may have touched on 11 in one or two<br/>tracks of his album _Uncommon Practice_.  Jules<br/>Siegel made extensive use of it, and his music may<br/>be available through the JI Network store.</p><p>You already know about Jon Catler.</p><p>&gt;Here&apos;s one main thing: I think I&apos;d rather have 44/27<br/>&gt;than 13/8 because they sound almost identical to me<br/>&gt;when compared to 1/1, at least as far as what feeling<br/>&gt;they portray.  44/27 is the 11/9 of 4/3 and I hear<br/>&gt;much more difference between 13/8 and 44/27 when<br/>&gt;paired with 4/3 than I do with 1/1.  I haven&apos;t found<br/>&gt;any place where 13 seems to give me a new feeling not<br/>&gt;already defined by another note, and somehow 13<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t sound really any more in-tune to me either.<br/>&gt;What am I missing?</p><p>13, of the higher harmonics, especially benefits from<br/>the presence of lower harmonics.  Try playing with<br/>different voicings and inversions of the triads and<br/>tetrads from the otonal Partch hexad, such as 4:5:13:15,<br/>11:13:15, 9:13:14, etc.</p><p>As for your question about 44:27, the numbers in this<br/>ratio are too high to give it &apos;identity&apos; as a &quot;just&quot;<br/>dyad.  It&apos;s going to be heard as a mis- or re-tuning<br/>of some lower-numbered ratio.  For example, 13:11 sounds<br/>pretty good, but not by virtue of it being a 13-limit<br/>harmony -- it approximates a minor third.  It may<br/>sound smoother than other nearby irrational intervals,<br/>but it won&apos;t have a fundamentally different sound from<br/>a minor 3rd.  So with 44:27, it may be approximating a<br/>13:8, or an 18:11, or a 5:3, or who knows.  As for why<br/>you liked it better than 13:8... who knows?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2003 1:13:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Wolf &lt;backfromthesilo@y...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Greetings.

I&apos;ve found<br/>that the overtone chord, meaning the next highest note in the<br/>chord being of a higher overtone, is very consonant even up to<br/>very high limits.  I was examining chords of exact overtones and<br/>using octave compression but maintiaining the natural order (not<br/>inverting any notes).  I found that beyond 31-limit still sounded<br/>consonant.  In fact straight series of overtones is quite an<br/>awesome sound.  But I really have no idea how to use that in any<br/>other musical context.  It&apos;s almost so powerful an effect that it<br/>denies any attempt to alter it when trying to progress on to other<br/>musical ideas.</p><p>So, outside of the context of overtone chords, 13-limit seems not<br/>to have much more value than 17 or 19-limit, except that with<br/>11-limit already 13 can and should be added before 17 or 19<br/>would be.  In this context 13 just emphasizes and strengthens a<br/>chord but does not change its feel.</p><p>On the other hand, as I&apos;ve said 11-limit notes seem to give new<br/>feelings and uses otherwise unavailable.</p><p>Also I don&apos;t agree that 11/6 is approximating anything.  It sounds<br/>awful when used simply to replace the context of a different 7th.<br/>11/9 definitely has a distinct feeling from other thirds, though I<br/>might agree with the argument that it contains some of each of<br/>6/5 and 5/4...</p><p>I&apos;m still interested in further thoughts on the issue, and again<br/>thanks for the useful insights so far.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2003 12:09:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; over<br/>&gt; &gt; on the harmonic entropy list, we were able to provide<br/>satisfactory<br/>&gt; &gt; answers to these questions for different people working in<br/>different<br/>&gt; &gt; contexts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be nice to see some code or pseudocode for computing this.</p><p>didn&apos;t i already address this question on the harmonic entropy list?</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2003 4:34:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; didn&apos;t i already address this question on the harmonic entropy list?</p><p>Do you have a url?</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2003 7:42:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;backfromthesilo&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:backfromthesilo@yahoo.com">backfromthesilo@yahoo.com</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; 11/9 definitely has a distinct feeling from other thirds, though I<br/>&gt; might agree with the argument that it contains some of each of<br/>&gt; 6/5 and 5/4...</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t.
