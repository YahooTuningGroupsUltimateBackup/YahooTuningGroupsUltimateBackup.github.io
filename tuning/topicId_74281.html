The only<br/>stipulation is that it should fit on 2 sides of A4 paper (Letter) and<br/>be between 2-5 minutes. I have about 10 pieces at the minute- see<br/><a href="http://www.duocontour.org/main_menu.htm">http://www.duocontour.org/main_menu.htm</a> - and there are some more in<br/>the pipeline. Some are with live electronics or CD too.</p><p>Would you be interested? Maybe you have suggestions of who might be<br/>interested. My aim is release a CD in at the end of 2008 or in 2009.<br/>My first CD of Donald Bousted&apos;s microtonal studies came out in January</p><p><a href="http://www.tutti.co.uk">www.tutti.co.uk</a></p><p>The trumpet is fully documented as part of the online microtonal<br/>trumpet manual project I have had with composer Donald Bousted<br/><a href="http://www.microtonaltrumpet.com">www.microtonaltrumpet.com</a></p><p>With thanks and best wishes,</p><p>Stephen Altoft<br/>Sulzburgerstr.92<br/>79114 Freiburg<br/>Germany<br/>Tel: (+49) (0) 761 4598029<br/>Mobile: (+49) (0) 174 3840146<br/>Email: <a href="mailto:stevealtoft@yahoo.com">stevealtoft@yahoo.com</a><br/>Website: <a href="http://www.duocontour.org">www.duocontour.org</a></p></div>
