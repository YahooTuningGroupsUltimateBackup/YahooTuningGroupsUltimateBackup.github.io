Yes, I now can change the<br/>scale so that &quot;middle C&quot; is 261.63HZ.  However, it completely changes<br/>the &quot;key,&quot; if you can call it that, of the piece -- of course.</p><p>It seems using the prior tuning, middle C, 261.63HZ is right at the very<br/>bottom of my MIDI keyboard... and I think I can work with that.  It<br/>certainly is nice to know it is &quot;adjustable.&quot;</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>___________ ____ __ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
