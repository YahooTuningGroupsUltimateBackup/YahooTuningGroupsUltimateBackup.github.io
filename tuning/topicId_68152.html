I haven&apos;t seen<br/>evidence to the contrary, so I assume he&apos;s right about this.</p><p>What evidence do you have that it was applied apart from *organs* that<br/>you can refer us to?</p><p>We do know that Bach had contact with Silbermann, who had his own<br/>clavier tuning. Why not go that route?</p><p>There&apos;s also the possibility that Bach devised his own tuning, which<br/>he didn&apos;t care to publish. Whether or not it has been reconstructed to<br/>date is moot. He may have simply thought that tuning was a relitively<br/> *unimportant* aspect of his music, and as long as a tuning<br/>circulated, it was fine....(certainly, Bach has been performed<br/>convincingly in everything from 12-TET to pick-your-WT-flavor to<br/>various meantones).</p><p>I&apos;m sure we would have more exacting records of Bach&apos;s preferences if<br/>he had any (or his son&apos;s, and we know that CPE simply spells out<br/>unmathematical generalizations about what a clavier tuning ought be,<br/>but nothing particularly detalied). Why should we think that the<br/>insistence on one &quot;true tuning&quot; is anythiing more than religion of<br/>sorts? (and that applies to Lehman, too :) -- I&apos;m not taking *any*<br/>sides in this debate except to say that maybe it&apos;s really not all that<br/>important -- yes yes we have new colors when we try new tunings, but<br/>why would Bach really say there was *one* way -- the very definition<br/>of the death of art)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=68156 href="#68156">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2006 11:48:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Location of Early CD on CD Baby: review is at the bottom<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/pitchrecs2/">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/pitchrecs2/</a></p><p>Thanks.

What I mean by &apos;flexible&apos; intonation is not &apos;crooning&apos;<br/>or &apos;sliding&apos; or indeed any sort of pitch bend within a note. It means<br/>a given note on the page is allowed to have different pitches at<br/>different points in the music.

But maybe that&apos;s due to my usual<br/>&gt; concentration on &apos;vertical&apos; tuning.  However, what should be obvious<br/>to everyone<br/>&gt; in the 2nd movement of Brandenburg 2 is that the recorder is not<br/>actually following any<br/>&gt; scheme of fixed pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  Hello again, Tom.  How silly sounding this is to me.  One thing<br/>about the second movement is the large leaps and virtuosity involved<br/>in getting everything to simply speak (let alone speak in &acirc;&euro;&oelig;tune&acirc;&euro;&#xFFFD;).<br/> May I caution against using the word &acirc;&euro;&oelig;obvious&acirc;&euro;&#xFFFD; in any serious way?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TD:  (Also, I am left to wonder why the music, even harpsichord<br/>solos, is<br/>&gt; in &apos;easy&apos; keys, when Werckmeister tuning should work in Ab major and<br/>&gt; F# major and so on ad infinitum...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  Now it seems we have reached a point in this discussion when it<br/>is important to extract misunderstandings:  Werckmeister III is<br/>designed to play in all keys while retaining more consonance in the<br/>diatonic keys.  What do Rudolf Rasch and Tom Dent not understand about<br/>this?  Werckmeister&acirc;&euro;&trade;s C Major Christmas Cantata should prove this to<br/>y&acirc;&euro;&trade;all.  And, most important, it is not merely the choice of tonic<br/>key, but the movements through different chords that makes for the<br/>modulation in baroque music.  Hence, all of the music gets some of the<br/>different intervallic possibilities, as perfect demonstrated by<br/>Bach&acirc;&euro;&trade;s harpsichord solos.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TD:  I&apos;m slightly surprised that Johnny puts the emphasis on<br/>fingering and<br/>&gt; doctoring fingerholes etc., when the recorder (and for that matter the<br/>&gt; bassoon) are so sensitive to wind pressure and / or embouchure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  Man, have you no idea how the bassoon in my hands, and others,<br/>has played in numerous tunings?  Did you not say yourself that the<br/>bassoon must follow the bass lines of the harpsichord left hand?  Did<br/>I not do that in the Johann Michael Bach Cantata on the same CD?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TD:  For the recorder this makes it almost inevitable that the pitch<br/>will trend<br/>&gt; upwards at the beginning of a note and downwards at the end, and any<br/>&gt; unsteadiness will immediately be audible as vibrato.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  A bit of nonsense.  The player has the responsibility to<br/>control the air velocity, and thus the tuning.  As a professor of<br/>bassoon at New York University, one third of lessons are on reeds, one<br/>third on breathing, and the remaining third is everything else.  BTW,<br/>if you want to hear great avant-garde recorder check out the PITCH CD<br/>Recorderist Pete Rose on CD Baby.  Only, Pete doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t do early<br/>music.  Tom, you won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t believe what Pete can accomplish.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Simply said, any instrument can hold a single pitch if the player is<br/>capable and willing.  You are thinking of insufficient players, I suspect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TD:  That is the<br/>&gt; character of the instrument, and it is not to be &apos;tamed&apos; to any fixed<br/>&gt; tuning except in the middle of a note with steady breath.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  Sorry, but that is pure baloney, and that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the nicest way I<br/>can say it.  Just as a singer can, one can start on any pitch heard in<br/>the head, especially after rehearsals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TD:  Playing the recorder in tune is almost always a clever and artistic<br/>&gt; illusion... I would like to see what happens if a recorder solo<br/>&gt; (played by Johnny or anyone else!) is put through a pitch analysis<br/>&gt; program.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s just a straight column with a fipple.  It, in fact,<br/>makes for a great tuning pipe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TD:  Nor does it mean players doing any darn thing they like. On the<br/>&gt; contrary, it means doing exactly that darn thing which gives<br/>&gt; sufficiently pure intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  This seems to me a contradiction; the recorder is<br/>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;incapable&acirc;&euro;&#xFFFD; of exact pitch, BUT it gives exact just relationships<br/>with proper thought and rehearsal.  Tom, unless you are a professional<br/>recorder player, where do you get these ideas from?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TD:  For example a player producing an B within a chord of E major might<br/>&gt; *during rehearsal* want to slide it up a little towards purity above<br/>&gt; the bass, or within a chord of G major to slide it a little down; then<br/>&gt; in performance might be able to remember and reproduce this difference<br/>&gt; without sliding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  In Werckmeister III, the result would sound like crap.  Maybe<br/>you thought I played like crap.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d rather you said that rather<br/>than malign the instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; TD:  Adaptive JI, or tuning sufficiently-pure above a bass, certainly<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t mean that singers or players must spend such-and-such a time<br/>&gt; sliding around in search of the note in performance. What&apos;s rehearsal<br/>&gt; for, with respect to tuning, if not to find out what pitch sounds<br/>&gt; better at what point?<br/>&gt; ~~~T~~~<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  Rehearsal is usually 3 times per concert for most any piece we<br/>play in the AFMM.  There is no &acirc;&euro;&oelig;extra&acirc;&euro;&#xFFFD; time allotted to tuning<br/>system in our group as it is worked out even before the first<br/>rehearsal begins by the individual players.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All best, Johnny<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; p.s.  And I really mean it.  We have been trying to explain our<br/>positions.
