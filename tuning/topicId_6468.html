Those familiar with my working philosophy in concert<br/>programming know that I consider all music to be microtonal because there are<br/>indeed so many models for intonation usage, including Javanese (or should I<br/>pull that one, too?)</p><p>Dan&apos;s &quot;honor&quot; to Carrillo notwithstanding, the &quot;smaller-than-a-semitone&quot;<br/>definition of a microtone is archaic.  For example, according to these howls,<br/>Egyptian music is not microtonal because there is no interval used in the<br/>maqam that are smaller than a semitone: they are all larger than a semitone.</p><p>Oh, on another point: just found evidence that George Ives, Charles&apos;s father,<br/>also considered C# higher than Db.  He discussed it in his theory book<br/>written for his son then a Freshman at Yale.  George Ives suggests that a C -<br/>Db be called an interval of a &quot;First&quot; since it is the first chromatic<br/>interval.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music</p></div>
