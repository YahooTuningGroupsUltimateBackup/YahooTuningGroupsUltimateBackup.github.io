Learning experientially, the musicians<br/>&gt; involved have discovered that EXACT cents values are necessary for quick and<br/>&gt; facile reading.</p><p>I wonder if the &quot;intuitive&quot; flexible tuning result gotten by my singers<br/>after repeated rehearsals of a conventionally notated chart relates to the<br/>&quot;EXACT cents values&quot; written into your charts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a player, on the bassoon for example, if I have to play an E +2, I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have to add any keys to succeed.  However, if I say JI only, it might change<br/>&gt; the sure-footedness of the A I played just before it.  Or there might not<br/>&gt; even be an A, but an odd interval before it.</p><p>In other words, it&apos;s good to know exactly where you&apos;re going regardless of<br/>where you are coming from? I think my singers learned (after sufficient<br/>repetitions) which way to nudge a specific pitch in order to &quot;lock&quot; a<br/>particular sonority. What a luxury to have the &quot;nudges&quot; planned ahead.</p><p>&gt; Still, you might ask, why put +2 when there is so little difference on an<br/>&gt; instrument that can&apos;t distinguish that well on its own (not unlike a trumpet<br/>&gt; in this sense)?  It matters, it matters, it matters.  All disaster would<br/>&gt; break out otherwise for this would be indicative of the musicians NOT having<br/>&gt; the EXACT position of the pitch in the mind which is necessary for the work<br/>&gt; we do.  Without the +2 on the E it is most likely that the very next note<br/>&gt; would be played wrong since we would lose the sense of relativity.  I do not<br/>&gt; have perfect pitch.</p><p>Nor do most of my singers. In fact, it&apos;s usually the &quot;perfect pitch&quot; singers<br/>who take the longest to catch on to flexible tuning.</p><p>Paul and I have been talking about the ear&apos;s limitations regarding a few<br/>cents of difference. I think I hear adjustments that are extremely small and<br/>he thinks such adjustments are not perceptible. He kindly has offered to<br/>conduct some experiments in that regard (as soon as I can find a window of<br/>time).</p><p>&gt; As a vocalist performing music of Harry Partch it is even more clear to me.<br/>&gt; When there is a repeated note like in &quot;Long Departed Lover&quot; one cannot merely<br/>&gt; repeat an exact pitch like it was a physics laboratory.  The mind zeros in on<br/>&gt; the EXACT pitch so that there is a human coloring to the phonemes of the<br/>&gt; words which are all important.  One does not speak naturally with exact<br/>&gt; repeats of pitch because that is the sound of the &quot;monotonous&quot; which is what<br/>&gt; put us to sleep in school when we were whelps.</p><p>Absolutely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The actual pitch inflections that ornament a repeated note are micro-micro,<br/>&gt; so small as not to register in the intellect for but a few.  It&apos;s close to<br/>&gt; using a different vowel in the head to change the tone for a singer.  To the<br/>&gt; surprise of some, it involves the juggling of intervals that may best be<br/>&gt; indicated by cents.  This choice of cents has no longer anything to do with<br/>&gt; equal temperament.  It is the grease by which performers can, and do, shimmer<br/>&gt; the sound, dazzle the listener, and keep the interest of the listener, all<br/>&gt; without vibrato.</p><p>Yep. That appears to describe the best sounds of the LA Jazz Choir. Also of<br/>The Real Group (from Sweden), Sixth Wave (who recently won the National A<br/>Cappella Sweepstakes Award) and some others.<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks, Johnny, for taking the time to clarify your earlier post. I<br/>appreciate it very much. In fact, much of what you say here supports my view<br/>that the ear can hear and make very minute adjustments. It&apos;s fascinating to<br/>me to learn that such adjustments are being notated into a score, including<br/>the &quot;how much.&quot;</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div><h3><a id=34128 href="#34128">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2002 4:06:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/12/02 11:07 AM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 22<br/>&gt;  Date: Tue, 12 Feb 2002 18:26:16 -0000<br/>&gt;  From: &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gdsecor@yahoo.com">gdsecor@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Extended techniques (Was: Patrick Ozzard-Low)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe that, in an ideal performance, the players should have the<br/>&gt; sensitivity to alter their intonation in both ways -- toward the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean in a resolving chord, and toward (5-limit) just<br/>&gt; intonation in the resolution.
