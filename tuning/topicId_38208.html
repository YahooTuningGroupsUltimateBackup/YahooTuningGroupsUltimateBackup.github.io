Did y&apos;all know Brahms was against intuition in<br/>composition?

It&apos;s funny how broad a range of composers<br/>&gt; claim to work by the &quot;intuitive...&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>When you say &quot;work by the &apos;intuitive,&apos;&quot; I think of intuitive in 2 different<br/>ways:<br/>(1) there is trusting one&apos;s intuition as Joseph seems to be doing.  People<br/>trust this at different percentages.  I often discuss it with people.  Just<br/>did recently independently of this thread.  Men usually don&apos;t trust it as<br/>high as I do, at 100%  This is for every day life and this intuition has its<br/>own logic.</p><p>But (2) there is compositional intuition, which is a bit different.  Though<br/>Xenakis usually didn&apos;t use it much in his compositions, there is his solo<br/>viola piece &quot;Enbellie&quot; which is entirely, and stated as such, intuitively<br/>composed.  When I compose I choose a non-intutitve compositional state first,<br/>often completely worked out before anything more than some sketches have been<br/>written down.  And then the intuition is given free reign.  My horn solo<br/>Ultra, my guitar solo Possessed, Neo...in fact all my pieces have<br/>improvisation in them.  Isn&apos;t that intuition of a higher percent?</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>&gt; It not only includes Feldman, but I believe Elliott Carter claims to<br/>&gt; work along those same lines... !<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J.
