At that time, the passage came immediately after a<br/>discussion on the point that not all tuning pluralists call themselves<br/>&quot;microtonalists,&quot; but many happily embrace the term.</p><p>In this discussion, I had used phrases such as &quot;self-identified<br/>microtonalist&quot; and &quot;self-declared microtonalist.&quot;</p><p>Coming now to my citation of Brian, I say to myself: &quot;Not all tuning<br/>pluralists refer to themselves as microtonalists, but here&apos;s one who<br/>certainly _does_, and exemplifies that term the whole nine yards, and<br/>more!&quot; Trying to put my exuberance into words, I might call my phrase<br/>&quot;self-proclaimed microtonalist&quot; a playful understatement on a<br/>Gargantuan scale.</p><p>Unfortunately, my feelings at that moment didn&apos;t get embedded into my<br/>FAQ draft, and more unfortunately, in the excitement of that moment, I<br/>didn&apos;t reflect on a feature of my subculture which might be anything<br/>but obvious to readers of the FAQ, or even initiated members of this<br/>List.</p><p>In my cultural circles, these are all positive, joyful, and laudatory<br/>phrases:</p><p>       &quot;a self-proclaimed anarchist/radical/microtonalist, etc.&quot;<br/>       &quot;a card-carrying abolitionist/17-tET&apos;er/xenharmonicist...&quot;<br/>       &quot;a notorious subversive&quot;</p><p>To say that someone is a &quot;self-proclaimed X&quot; has the implications:</p><p>       1. Of course we know that s/he dares to say &quot;I&apos;m X.&quot;<br/>       2. That X is a good thing, needless to say!<br/>       3. We know that X is controversial, and revel in it.<br/>       4. S/he _is_ X, to the highest power, as we all know.</p><p>The problem, of course -- so glaringly obvious once you called it to<br/>my attention! -- is that for readers not part of my subculture,<br/>&quot;self-proclaimed microtonalist&quot; could and likely would be read as a<br/>&quot;condescending-sounding term with inappropriate implications.&quot; In<br/>other words, it would carry implications just about exactly the<br/>opposite of those intended.</p><p>Especially in an e-mail or similar situation of this kind, if it<br/>_sounds_ wrong, it _is_ wrong! Thanks for alerting me now, so that I<br/>can prevent needless misunderstandings.</p><p>Your most timely words, Jeff, also give me the opportunity to clarify<br/>my intentions for people on this List, not all of whom may share my<br/>subcultural idiom of &quot;self-proclaimed&quot; as having the most positive<br/>connotations.</p><p>People here already &quot;in the know&quot; may not find it too hard, especially<br/>once I point it and explain it, to see that one theme of this FAQ<br/>draft is a tribute to Brian McLaren and Ivor Darreg.</p><p>For example, when I compare Ivor Darreg to Nicola Vicentino, that is<br/>about the highest compliment I can pay to any musician. It&apos;s also a<br/>compliment by association to Brian as Darreg&apos;s disciple and<br/>colleague.</p><p>A point which only I could know, and which this occasion at least<br/>provides an opportunity to share, is that Brian McLaren is the person<br/>who called 20-tET to my attention as a possible neo-Gothic tuning -- a<br/>wonderfully Darregesque touch, a temperament for neo-Gothic where the<br/>fifths are 18 cents from pure! I tried it, and I love it -- using a<br/>&quot;puff pipes&quot; timber which seems delightfully Setharian for this<br/>tuning.</p><p>Thus my 20-tET reference in that draft is a very personal tribute to<br/>Brian, but even the most initiated and attentive reader scanning<br/>&quot;between the lines&quot; with an electron microscope would have no way of<br/>knowing this -- so I&apos;m saying it now.</p><p>In trying to &quot;translate&quot; the phrase &quot;self-proclaimed microtonalist<br/>Brian McLaren&quot; into something that will carry my intended meaning,<br/>I&apos;ve decided on &quot;master microtonal composer and historian Brian<br/>McLaren.&quot; For a FAQ reader unfamiliar with Brian, my admiration for<br/>him and Darreg, or my subcultural sense of humor, that may be at once<br/>more informative and safer, and at the same time communicate the<br/>superlative compliment intended.</p><p>Face-to-face, at a dinner party in Brian&apos;s honor hypothetically filled<br/>with people of my own sociopolitical subculture, I might say,<br/>&quot;joyfully self-proclaimed microtonalist Brian McLaren&quot; -- that opening<br/>adverb reinforcing the festive tone.</p><p>Maybe one lesson is that while a FAQ should be entertaining, it is not<br/>necessarily a dinner party.</p><p>Jeff, thanks for your other feedback, too, of course.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson, thank you for your encouragement, and now you have me<br/>considering some curious &quot;panmodalist&quot; ideas which I might yet get<br/>into order -- or creative chaos -- and actually translate into some<br/>music.</p><p>Jon Szanto, your point about more information on microtonal music of<br/>the last century suggests to me a closely related FAQ item something<br/>like this:</p><p>Q. What are some examples of microtonal music over the last century?</p><p>This also, of course, could be done as another answer to the question<br/>&quot;What is microtonality?&quot; -- for this kind of questions, lots of<br/>viewpoints and voices may be the best approach to the reality of the<br/>music and the diverse constituency of this List.</p><p>In writing my contribution, I found it most natural and convincing to<br/>write about some of the composers, theorists, and styles most shaping<br/>my own musical life -- which should be an invitation for others to do<br/>the same, especially in defining something like &quot;microtonality&quot; which<br/>has so many aspects.</p><p>What an honor it is to be discussing this with people like yourself<br/>who have played such a role in preserving and expanding the tradition;<br/>needless to say, you have some very special things to contribute on<br/>Harry Partch and much else -- another &quot;understatement of the decade.&quot;</p><p>While there are &quot;touches&quot; of 20th-21st century history in my draft --<br/>the 24-tET references, 20-tET, Ivor Darreg -- I warmly agree that this<br/>era needs filling in: as the saying goes, it takes a community to make<br/>a FAQ!</p><p>Also, to my best knowledge, &quot;paucitonal&quot; may be new -- although having<br/>been surprised on this score concerning more than one of my &quot;newly<br/>(re-)discovered tunings,&quot; I&apos;d want to be cautious about assuming that<br/>my knowledge is complete.</p><p>Daniel Wolf, thank you for bringing your scholarship and lucid<br/>discourse into play in your caution regarding Brian McLaren&apos;s<br/>connection between reported anti-24-tET prejudices in the Vienna of<br/>1917 and the musical politics of the Third Reich.</p><p>My intended point was a general one: that viewing other musics and<br/>cultures as on &quot;a lower level&quot; can lead to the &quot;lower level&quot; concept<br/>of a term like &quot;subhuman.&quot; At this point I am inclined to add a remark<br/>to Note 2 clarifying this, and noting your caution about any possible<br/>inference of a direct equation between Nazism and antimicrotonality,<br/>as well as your observation about antiserialism.</p><p>Of course, I would seek your feedback to be sure that I have stated<br/>your views correctly.</p><p>Although mostly tangential to usual discussions here -- apart from<br/>this kind of question, where they are most relevant -- the mixed<br/>implications of &quot;barbaric&quot; or &quot;barbarian&quot; in German, or sometimes in<br/>English, are a very important point, and here your linguistic and<br/>cultural expertise adds perspective. Around the early 1960&apos;s, as I<br/>recall, there was a book published called _The New Barbarians_ dealing<br/>with mostly peaceful counterculturists -- &quot;Beatniks&quot; may have been<br/>then the term. The book was sympathetic, and whatever the exact<br/>implications intended, I didn&apos;t take them as necessarily at all<br/>pejorative.</p><p>We&apos;re much in agreement on pluralism with room for serialists (12-tET<br/>or otherwise) and everyone else: &quot;If I can&apos;t compose or improvise in<br/>whatever scale I choose, then it&apos;s not a true revolution!&quot;</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=19848 href="#19848">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/6/2001 6:37:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
