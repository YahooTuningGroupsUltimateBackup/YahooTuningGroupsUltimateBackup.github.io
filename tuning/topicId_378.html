I remain skeptical about the<br/>&gt;results, however...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As you should. It is impossible to &quot;prove&quot; anything<br/>&gt;about the origins of scales. The correspondences between<br/>&gt;spectra (timbre) and tuning (scale) for both pelog and slendro<br/>&gt;are intruiging and very suggestive, in the same kind of way<br/>&gt;that sounds with harmonic spectra correspond very nicely with<br/>&gt;the various JI scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; This said, I find that his results are extremely suggestive for the design<br/>&gt;of electronic timbres to play with gamelan instruments or to mediate<br/>&gt;between gamelan instruments and instruments with integer-valued harmonic<br/>&gt;spectra. It seems reasonable, for example that slendro-like scales, with<br/>&gt;wide fifths, will sound well with timbres including, as Sethares has it, a<br/>&gt;partial tone at 1.52 (724.89 cents) times the fundamental. Similarly, one<br/>&gt;might design pelog-able timbres with a partial tone of less than 1.5 or<br/>&gt;with a smallish minor-third interval somewhere in the spectrum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Indeed, I have been working quite a bit on this recently.<br/>&gt;I have created an &quot;orchestra&quot; of sounds with spectra designed to<br/>&gt;be coincident with the relevant 5 and 7 note scales. These start with<br/>&gt;a sample (say of a guitar) and then map the partials of the spectrum<br/>&gt;to the nearest location for the 5-tet or 7-tone, creating<br/>&gt;a &quot;slendro guitar&quot; sample. I have done this for about 25 different<br/>&gt;instruments, and would be willing to share the samples with people.<br/>&gt;The format of the sounds is for the Ensoniq EPS/ASR, so email me if<br/>&gt;you have use of one of these and would like to check out the sounds.<br/>&gt;Perhaps the neatest part of these sounds is that, as Daniel suggests,<br/>&gt;they work well in the specified scale, but also are compatible with<br/>&gt;harmonic sounds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Indeed, timbres based on 9tet will sound reasonably well<br/>&gt;with most any pelog.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Can you explain this more? What is the relationship between<br/>&gt;pelog and 9-tet? (Or did you mean 7-tet?)</p><p>+------------------------------------------------------+<br/>| Mark Nowitzky                                        |<br/>| email:  <a href="mailto:nowitzky@alum.mit.edu">nowitzky@alum.mit.edu</a>    AIM:  Nowitzky      |<br/>| www:    <a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky</a>          |<br/>|         &quot;If you haven&apos;t visited Mark Nowitzky&apos;s home |<br/>|         page recently, you haven&apos;t missed much...&quot;   |<br/>+------------------------------------------------------+</p></div>
