I&apos;ll<br/>delete my last post, but I re-read Jeremy&apos;s original answer, and the<br/>2nd section of his *first* definition of inversion, where pitches<br/>changes, is not what I would commonly utilize. While the melodic<br/>inversion seems more common, the chordal does not. The second complete<br/>definition of chordal inversion is the more common use.</p><p>Large apologies for the confusion. Really.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
