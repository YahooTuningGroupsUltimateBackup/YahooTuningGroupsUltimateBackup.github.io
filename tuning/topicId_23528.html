Partch is really hitting stride now that he&apos;s been dead 25 years (typical) and Blackburn has unearthed a lot of nice stuff. If you aren&apos;t familiar with his work, don&apos;t miss a chance to check this out.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2001 1:26:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.
