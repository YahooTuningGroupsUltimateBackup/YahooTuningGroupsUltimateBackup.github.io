Also, we&apos;ve gone over the definitions for these<br/>recently -- check the archives. The terms come from Erv Wilson (MOS --<br/>though Myhill&apos;s property is equivalent) and Rothenberg (proper and strictly<br/>proper). &quot;Transpositionally coherent&quot; is a new idea that Carl and I are<br/>throwing around -- no definition yet. 1-D means one-dimensional, as in a<br/>Pythagorean or meantone scale. 2-D means two dimensional, as in a scale with<br/>both just perfect fifths (3:2) and just major thirds (5:4). A rotation means<br/>that you consider a scale to be a circle (since it repeats every octave) and<br/>you&apos;re just rotating the circle by some number of scale steps.</p><p>Who&apos;s Eskelin???</p></div><h3>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>10/28/1999 5:26:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John Link wrote,<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve read Rameau, Helmholtz, Hindemith,<br/>&gt;&gt;Partch, and Eskelin (have any of you read Eskelin?), but obviously I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;&gt;missed something.<br/>&gt;<br/>Paul H. Erlich responded:</p><p>&gt;Who&apos;s Eskelin???</p><p>Gerald Eskelin runs the L.A. Jazz Choir. His book, &quot;Lies My Music Teacher<br/>Told Me&quot;, is available from Stage 3 Publishing / 5759 Wallis Lane /<br/>Woodland Hills, CA  91367. His phone number, which is published in his<br/>book, is (818)704-8657.<br/>I often see the book at Barnes and Noble in New York.</p><p>John Link</p></div>
