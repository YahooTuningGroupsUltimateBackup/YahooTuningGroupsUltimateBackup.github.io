In addition<br/>&gt;to the medieval-centric examples You give, I&apos;d like<br/>&gt;to point out that there are hundreds (thousands?) of<br/>&gt;12-tET serial composers (especially concerning the<br/>&gt;body of work created between c. 1925 and 1980, and on<br/>&gt;second thought, not necessarily restricted to serialists<br/>&gt;using 12-tET), who would subscribe wholeheartedly to<br/>&gt;this statement.</p><p>&gt;Many present-day tuning theorists (Brian McLaren comes<br/>&gt;immediately to mind) are fond of pointing out that<br/>&gt;so much of the compositional construction in these serial<br/>&gt;pieces cannot be audibly perceived, but IMO, that<br/>&gt;doesn&apos;t necessarily negate the significance of those<br/>&gt;techniques.  I firmly believe that there are many<br/>&gt;as-yet unrevealed means of perceiving data that *do*<br/>&gt;have an effect on the reception of any given experience,<br/>&gt;particularly in some kind of wholistic sense.  In other<br/>&gt;words, just because a listener can&apos;t immediately *hear*<br/>&gt;that a 12-tone row is being used in inversion or<br/>&gt;retrograde doesn&apos;t mean categorically that s/he is<br/>&gt;not picking up that information in some other way.</p><p>Rue the day that I ever make music with inaudible elements. That may be OK<br/>to you guys, but it&apos;s ^#$@!&amp;* nonsense to me. As far as I&apos;m concerned, if it<br/>can&apos;t be heard, it&apos;s not a musical element. If I felt like it I could make<br/>tens of thousands of pseudo-harmonic-entropy-to-the-pi-power-squared models<br/>that people could turn into crab canons in retrograde inversion . . . five<br/>billion partially stellated periodicity blocks with pickles and cole slaw<br/>that could be regurgitated in strict serial imitative counterpoint . . . any<br/>of this kind of &quot;conceptual&quot; composition is an insult to me as a musician<br/>and music-lover.</p><p>Monz&apos; argument might be that the listener might pick up on some of these<br/>patterns somehow and they might somehow affect the musical experience in<br/>some way. Then again, they might not. For each of the googolplex<br/>mathematically defined patterns we might choose to base a composition on,<br/>which will have a musical effect and which won&apos;t? The vast majority<br/>wouldn&apos;t. We&apos;d never have time to test all the possibilities, and apparantly<br/>we (Lerdahl, McLaren, etc.) haven&apos;t had any luck in convincing the little<br/>corner of academia which cares that serialism might not be one of the<br/>successful ones.</p><p>Even the sets of rules that you get in music school are of questionable<br/>utility. All great composers broke the supposed rules of their style,<br/>because they were guided not by formulae but by a driving creative urge in<br/>which balancing the counterposing forces of fulfilling and not fulfilling<br/>expectations provides artistic interest (much as in great literature). This<br/>psycho-cultural game is far beyond the grasp of any concisely formalizable<br/>mathematical model, and the rules are changing all the time as our musical<br/>environment changes. That&apos;s not to say a composer can&apos;t use his or her<br/>musical intuition to arrive at a mathematical way of composing, e.g.,<br/>microtonalists like Iannis Xenakis and Carter Scholz. But these<br/>considerations are expressly and ultimately (a) artistic and (b) AUDIBLE,<br/>they&apos;re never mathematical for the sake of mathematics and they&apos;re certainly<br/>never inaudible or questionably audible.</p><p>Great music is made by great listeners with great inspiration. Knowing how<br/>to turn inspiration into an _audible_ result is where theory, mathematics,<br/>and technical skill in general can sometimes be useful. If you&apos;re relying on<br/>some possibly inaudible mathematical scheme instead of inspiration, you&apos;re<br/>not a composer, as far as I&apos;m concerned . . . you&apos;re a tinkerer (I believe<br/>that&apos;s Sonny Sharrock&apos;s term). And the more tinkerers we have in the<br/>alternate-tuning movement, the more we doom that movement to cultural<br/>irrelevancy.</p><p>Note that I think Monz and Dan Stearns certainly make good music, but that<br/>ultimately it was their ears coupled with creative intuition that were<br/>responsible.</p></div><h3><a id=16036 href="#16036">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2000 12:29:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul E:]<br/>&gt;Rue the day that I ever make music with inaudible elements.

But I must say<br/>that in many regards (often uncomfortable ones) this isn&apos;t all that<br/>different from the very old arguments over program and absolute music,<br/>and yet very few seem to get as passionate about throwing the<br/>&quot;conceptual&quot; in program music to the wolves as so many seem so willing<br/>to do with serial music (and the like).</p><p>Why?</p><p>There can be little doubt that the program in program music on a whole<br/>(i.e., divorced from its various specifics -- cultural contexts, the<br/>times, et al -- and heard without any shared knowledge of its<br/>&quot;narrative&quot;, etc.) is even less &quot;audible&quot; than the hat in Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&apos;a hat is a hat whether it is seen from above or below, or from the<br/>side or the front&apos; (a not so good analogy used by Shoenberg to help<br/>frame the use of mirror techniques).</p><p>Much great art has been accompanied by shaky metaphors and<br/>questionable attributions, and I&apos;m quite sure that we&apos;re all blinded<br/>and lead to some extent by our own individual passions, bents and<br/>crusades.
