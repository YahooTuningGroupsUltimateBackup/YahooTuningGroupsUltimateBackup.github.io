However, if you&apos;re playing the scale two notes at a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;time, the diadic measure I&apos;ve been using is quite appropriate.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I guess that depends on how much stock we decide to place in &quot;echo&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m open to suggestions, but your own examples have taught me, over<br/>&gt;&gt;the years, a great respect for echo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You mean examples of my guitar playing? Well, I think of what I do with<br/>&gt;delay more in terms of counterpoint (as in a round) rather than creating<br/>&gt;one big chord with all the notes in the scale.</p><p>Sorry for not making myself clear, but I meant a kind of psychoacoustic<br/>&quot;echo&quot; -- musical context, if you will.  I suspect the common-fundamental,<br/>chord-like quality of the harmonic series segment would prevail over many<br/>duets tuned to it.  But I see what you&apos;re saying Paul, and I&apos;m all for it.<br/>I just wanted readers to know that your views are part of a large, self-<br/>consistent model of music-making -- one that reflects, in places, the type<br/>of music you&apos;re interested in...  Bottom line: I don&apos;t believe the 39-point<br/>scale is any lower in harmonic entropy than the 40-point one, until we<br/>assume mutiple fundamentals, chord changes, yada.  I don&apos;t think the duet<br/>restriction will do it (cough).</p><p>Incidentally, I&apos;ve had many blissful listening moments hearing delay as<br/>counterpoint -- but I almost always find it nasty by the time it starts<br/>making a chord out of the scale in a melodic passage.  By &quot;your examples&quot;,<br/>I meant theory-ones about approximations and such -- one involving the<br/>8/5 comes to mind.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=12370 href="#12370">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2000 1:36:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;I suspect the common-fundamental,<br/>&gt;&gt;chord-like quality of the harmonic series segment would prevail over many<br/>&gt;&gt;duets tuned to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, and the results would not be very musically charming, IMO.</p><p>As I said -- you&apos;re down to using your own musical taste here.  Which is<br/>good, so long as you say so (as you did).  To be fair, I have no more<br/>evidence in favor of such duets than you have against them -- I&apos;m using my<br/>taste too.  But I have a stab: I think the average listener can track the<br/>partial number of a note over a drone, and I think I&apos;ve heard this being<br/>exploited for beautiful melody many times.  It&apos;s one of the three things I<br/>think listeners can use to track a melody: pitch (Miller limit), scale<br/>degrees (Rothenberg propriety), and partial positions (sensory consonance).<br/>It&apos;s action between the latter two that results in diatonicity.  This is<br/>the same business I&apos;ve been pitching since I joined the list -- one which<br/>I&apos;ve never been able to make clear to my satisfaction, and one which has<br/>anyway been given short shrift by list readership, IMO.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=12372 href="#12372">ðŸ”—</a>Jacky Ligon &#x3C;jacky_ekstasis@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2000 3:06:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;CLUMMA@N...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;   It&apos;s one of the three things I<br/>&gt; think listeners can use to track a melody: pitch (Miller limit),<br/>scale<br/>&gt; degrees (Rothenberg propriety), and partial positions (sensory<br/>consonance).<br/>&gt; It&apos;s action between the latter two that results in diatonicity.</p><p>Carl,</p><p>Hello.</p><p>Could you explain the &quot;action between the latter two&quot; in laymens<br/>terms? When you say &quot;results in diatonicity&quot;, am I understanding<br/>correctly that it is the interaction between the Rothenberg property<br/>and &quot;partial positions&quot; (perception of overtones in the timbre being<br/>used), is what results in the listener&apos;s perception of a<br/>scale&apos;s &quot;diatonicity&quot;? Very interesting! Do explain more.</p><p>A little help with the Miller Limit would be of great help. Got a<br/>paper, post or web page on that one?</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Jacky</p></div>
