I really appreciate the kind words.</p><p>We&apos;ve been slammed for &quot;so many numbers, so little music&quot;,<br/>and I feel that to a large extent I&apos;m dropped into that<br/>category, so I figured it was time I had better get some<br/>good microtonal music &quot;out there&quot;.</p><p>[Lumma:]<br/>&gt; Have you heard his 24Tune?<br/>&gt; It&apos;s on his webpage under list of works.</p><p>&gt; I actually like it better than invisible haircut.</p><p>You told me you like the &quot;24-Eq Tune&quot;, Carl, but<br/>I&apos;m really surprised that you don&apos;t like &quot;Invisible<br/>Haircut&quot; more.  Not that I&apos;m trying to slight the<br/>other tune, but I wrote that mainly because I felt<br/>24-Eq had been criticized &quot;unjustly&quot;, and I took<br/>it as a challenge to write something that sounded<br/>good in that tuning.</p><p>&quot;Invisible Haircut&quot;, on the other hand, was really<br/>an inspiration.  It just popped into my head and/or<br/>fingers one day, and immediately, as soon as I&apos;d<br/>played it, I could imagine all the different just<br/>ratios swirling about.</p><p>[Erlich:]<br/>&gt; This type of transcription, with 11 and 13 and 19<br/>&gt; identities, leads to a pronounced &quot;periodicity buzz&quot;<br/>&gt; in the otonalities that is radically different from<br/>&gt; the jazz aesthetic but has a flavor that can certainly<br/>&gt; grow on you (Kami Rousseau had some similar transcriptions<br/>&gt; on his web page . . .</p><p>I&apos;m quite happy with the way my &quot;justification&quot; of it<br/>turned out.  The &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; in that V/V - V - I<br/>progression really does it for *me*!</p><p>&gt; Also, the progression from the 126/95-Otonality to<br/>&gt; the 9/5-Otonality is quite nice as a V-I, even though<br/>&gt; the root rises by a fourth of 529 cents (or drops by<br/>&gt; a fifth of 671 cents).</p><p>These are the two chords that really display<br/>that &quot;buzz&quot;.  I thought I&apos;d go into a little<br/>more detail about Paul&apos;s observation about the<br/>size of the intervals.</p><p>I&apos;m adding the following &quot;minor&quot; chord into this<br/>description.  Altho my harmonic analysis (on the<br/>webpage) of the &quot;Eb minor&quot; chord is as a 27/20-Utonality,<br/>it can also be thought of in the traditional sense<br/>as a &quot;minor&quot; chord built upwards on &quot;Eb&quot; 6/5.</p><p>Here&apos;s a diagram, in cents (rounded to 2 decimal<br/>places), of the &quot;root&quot; movement of these three chords,<br/>and the intervals of both the V-I skips, and the<br/>stepwise movement in the (Schenkerian) &quot;prolongation&quot;<br/>from the 126/95 to the 6/5:</p><p>126/95        9/5          6/5<br/>488.91      1017.59       315.64<br/>  | \        /     \        /  |<br/>  |   671.31         498.04    |<br/>   \________ 173.27 __________/</p><p>I believe the reason this works so well<br/>is because there is a &quot;xenharmonic bridge&quot;<br/>at play here.  The difference between<br/>126/95 and 4/3 is the interval 190/189<br/>[= 9.13+ cents].  If we analyze the intervals<br/>in the above progression with 4/3-Otonality<br/>substituted for the 126/95-Otonality, we get:</p><p>4/3           9/5            6/5<br/>498.04      1017.59        315.64<br/>  | \        /     \        /  |<br/>  |   680.44         498.04    |<br/>   \________ 182.40 __________/</p><p>Although it&apos;s not your usual Pythagorean [3-limit]<br/>bass-line, this is a &quot;root&quot;-movement that would be<br/>familiar to most people, since it occurs in the<br/>(implied) JI/meantone diatonic scale.</p><p>The II (supertonic - &quot;minor&quot;) is *the* problem chord<br/>in (implied) 5-limit diatonic music.  Sometimes the<br/>II-degree has to be tuned to 9/8 to be consonant with<br/>the Dominant (V), sometimes tuned to 10/9 to be consonant<br/>with the Subdominant (IV).</p><p>Notwithstanding Paul&apos;s observation about how my chords<br/>here are &quot;radically different from the jazz aesthetic&quot;,<br/>jazz harmony was very much how I was thinking when I<br/>wrote this tune.</p><p>In jazz , the standard chord progressions are strings<br/>of V-I&apos;s, and that&apos;s what I did in this little section.<br/>Thus, we can assume a local tonicization of the &quot;Eb&quot; 6/5<br/>in the above progression.</p><p>In the &quot;key of Eb 6/5&quot;, the &quot;I&quot; is 6/5, the &quot;V&quot; is 9/5,<br/>and the &quot;II&quot; (the &quot;V of V&quot;) is, in this case, 4/3.</p><p>So I think that it&apos;s entirely possible that we&apos;re<br/>&quot;hearing&quot; 4/3 for 126/95, as well as perceiving a<br/>more familiar 40/27 skip for the 28/19 actually heard<br/>between &quot;F&quot; and &quot;Bb&quot;, and a 10/9 step for the 21/19<br/>actually heard between the &quot;F&quot; and &quot;Eb&quot;, by making<br/>use of the 9-cent xenharmonic bridge from the 3- to<br/>the 19-limit.</p><p>BTW, I didn&apos;t plan any of this - it &quot;just&quot; worked<br/>out that way.  I figured out the JI &quot;translation&quot; years<br/>ago by writing out pages full of common-tone chord<br/>progressions.  It was only much later that I<br/>&quot;saw that confounded bridge&quot;.<br/>[pun intended, for Led Zeppelin fans]</p><p>I wish I could draw a lattice of it here to simplify<br/>the explanation (and because it&apos;s *beautiful*!),<br/>but 19-limit is too complex (and too big).</p><p>Other small 3--19 bridges were implied in the<br/>Chromatic and Enharmonic genera of the ancient<br/>Greek Eratosthenes, c. 200 BC, and in the Chromatic<br/>genus of Boethius, c. 505 AD, and have also popped<br/>up in my explanation of Marchetto&apos;s &quot;fifth-tone&quot;<br/>theories, c. 1318.  (c. - I mean see, my website)</p><p>I&apos;d like to point out that, tho I already admitted<br/>this was a transcription (since it was first composed<br/>on a 12-Eq keyboard), the sound of the JI version you<br/>hear was very much in my head from the moment I wrote<br/>it.  This is the case for a lot of 12-Eq music I&apos;ve<br/>written over the last ten years.</p><p>The entire reason I developed my lattice theory is<br/>because I despaired of having an instrument that could<br/>give me all the pitches I wanted, and the lattice<br/>diagram model was the best way for me to understand<br/>and internalize the musical relationships.</p><p>Associating the visual mapping with the sound of<br/>the intervals was the only way I could make sense<br/>of the vast array(s) of ratios in the musical fabric.<br/>So even as I write or play in 12-Eq, I&apos;m hearing<br/>(in my head) ratios that I can visualize on the lattice.</p><p>Having instruments available now in 17-, 19-,<br/>22-, and 31-Eq helps a bit, because at least it<br/>gives me some more of the sounds, but I still think<br/>in JI and sure wish I could afford a Microzone!<br/>(or even a Clavette!)  It would take a lot of the<br/>work out of what I&apos;m doing . . .</p><p>(&quot;justified&quot; another of my old tunes last night)</p><p>-Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>Listen to &quot;Invisible Haircut&quot; at:<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/haircut.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/haircut.html</a><br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3><a id=1888 href="#1888">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/1999 6:00:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Erlich:]<br/>&gt; It is magical how JI transcription happened<br/>&gt; to &quot;work&quot; on this one.</p><p>[Lumma:]<br/>&gt; Ackg!  JI can always work this well, no magic.</p><p>[Erlich:]<br/>&gt; If you read the &quot;Invisible Haircut&quot; page itself,<br/>&gt; you&apos;ll see that Joe says he could not apply this<br/>&gt; kind of JI trascription to works of other composers<br/>&gt; that he tried it on.</p><p>I had been thinking about responding to this<br/>earlier and now you kind of pushed me into the ring.</p><p>As far as JI working &quot;magically&quot; in my tune:<br/>I have to side with Carl on this.  I enjoy writing<br/>and especially improvising in different kinds of<br/>ETs and other tunings too, but with JI I can<br/>always find *exactly* the pitch I&apos;m looking for.</p><p>I should have been more specific when I talked<br/>about how this &quot;justification&quot; didn&apos;t work for<br/>other composers.  I&apos;ve tried to use 7-limit ratios<br/>for Mozart and couldn&apos;t make it work, and there<br/>are 12-Eq tunes that I&apos;ve tried to interpret<br/>rationally and I just can&apos;t do it.</p><p>By it &quot;working&quot;, what Paul and I mean is that<br/>in ETs you are able to write repeated phrases<br/>that cycle back to the same point, and in JI<br/>there are usually commatic shifts involved in<br/>repeated cycling.</p><p>I suppose what the Mozart experiment proved is<br/>that Mozart was pretty much thinking in 5-limit/meantone,<br/>because higher-limit intervals just sounded &quot;off&quot;.<br/>(I even tried 19s in Mozart)</p><p>I think the main reason it &quot;worked&quot; in &quot;Invisible<br/>Haircut&quot; is because I unconsciously made use of<br/>the 3--19 bridge, so the root movement can be<br/>perceived basically as Pythagorean or 5-limit.<br/>The bridge is what made the magic.</p><p>- Monzo<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
