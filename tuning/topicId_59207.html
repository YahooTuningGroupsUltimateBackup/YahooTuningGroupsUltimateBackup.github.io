My problem is<br/>that my mother tongue is German, and the only other language which I<br/>speak is English. The few German books on the subject leave the more<br/>dry stuff like Pythagorean ratios and 53-comma-scales aside to not<br/>bore the reader, but they are exactly what interests me. So what I<br/>need is a source that outlines to me the theories of al-Farabi,<br/>Urmevi, Karadeniz, Esgi, Yekta, Arel, Oransay, just to name the ones<br/>that interest me most, and in English. Any pointer is welcome.<br/>Thanks,<br/>Michael</p></div>
