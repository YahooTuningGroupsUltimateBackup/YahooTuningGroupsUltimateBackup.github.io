Of course, I am afraid to go look at<br/>&gt; the site, but I guess I will sooner or later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We don&apos;t concentrate on tuning systems in a minute way.  I&apos;ve been in<br/>&gt; a performance where that was done, and it was very hard to make<br/>&gt; actual music -- but then, if everyone had mastered the system (I think<br/>&gt; it was some sort of meantone), it would become second nature and be<br/>&gt; transcended, like learning to drive a stickshift.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In any case, we aim for ending in the same ballpark where the piece<br/>&gt; began, first of all (&quot;staying in tune&quot; in the grossest sense).  Making<br/>&gt; our structural fifths rather high, major thirds a bit small and minor<br/>&gt; thirds a bit large, (all subject to adjustment, especially at cadences)<br/>&gt; seems to help us do that.  Certain modes seem to call for adjustments,<br/>&gt; especially in semitone relationships.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We appreciate your appreciation, believe me.  I will get courageous<br/>&gt; enough to step right up to the spectrograph and see what it made of<br/>&gt; us, I promise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sincerely,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Susan Hellauer<br/>&gt; Anonymous 4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PS -- The Lily and the Lamb is one of our particular favorite cds, too.</p><p>David<br/>OK, I can wake up anytime now.</p></div>
