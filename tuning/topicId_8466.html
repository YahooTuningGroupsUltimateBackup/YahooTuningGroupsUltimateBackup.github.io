Pumping is the first thing you were talking about, where<br/>the ending pitch is different from the starting pitch.</p></div><h3><a id=8474 href="#8474">ðŸ”—</a>Jay Williams &#x3C;jaywill@utah-inter.net&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 08:08 PM 2/11/00 -0500, you wrote:<br/>&gt;From: &quot;Paul H.

I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t like it much when _human singers do it, and they can do it<br/>&gt; surprisingly smoothly.</p><p>As a newcomer here, I am still learning the jargon. Can I assume that<br/>&quot;adoptive tuning&quot; is similar to what I experience as scale steps moving to<br/>accommodate changing roots? Is the &quot;pump&quot; an expression referring to that<br/>process?</p><p>If so, this experience might be relevant.</p><p>The LA Jazz Choir (my group) was doing a sound check on stage at the Dorothy<br/>Chandler Auditorium (Los Angeles Music Center) and was singing (without<br/>accompaniment) a two-and-a-half-minute passage of very chromatic music (an<br/>Earle Brown arrangement of &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;). At the conclusion of that<br/>segment, the orchestra director for the show, Peter Matz, came out of the<br/>wings with a big smile on his face and walked to the piano and played the<br/>chord we were singing--a tribute to the fact that with all of the &quot;pumping&quot;<br/>we had done we came out in the same key we started with.</p><p>The point of all of this (other than to enjoy a bit of reminiscing) is that<br/>adjusting chord members (scale steps) does not seem to mess with the<br/>singers&apos; concept of tonic. Interesting, huh? (I hope.)</p><p>&gt; But the kind of pumping that makes an interval shift by a noticeable amount<br/>&gt; to accommodate a particular chord is quite neat to my ears.</p><p>I doubt that an audience would hear the &quot;pumping&quot; going on in our<br/>performance. However, the singers themselves often remarked about how far<br/>they had to move in order to accommodate the shift.</p><p>&gt; Yeah, in the shape note style, I guess I&apos;d agree that the tuning is a freely<br/>&gt; interpreted Pythagorean thing.</p><p>&quot;Shape note&quot; style? As in &quot;southern gospel&quot;? Pythgoras who? Did he write<br/>southern gospel????</p><p>Smiles,</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
