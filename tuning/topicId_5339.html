So that piece of yours that I turned into a cd for<br/>&gt; the fest, ... &lt;snip&gt; ..., what was it called?</p><p>_A Noiseless Patient Spider_, a setting of the Walt Whitman poem.</p><p>&gt; [Dave]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why was it in 12tet/ji instead of ji?</p><p>You might be able to just barely say that it hints at 12-tET.<br/>But it would be most correct to describe it thus:</p><p>The piece is entirely microtonal, using a 13-tone symmetrical<br/>5-limit JI system for the middle section, and a much more<br/>complex set of JI pitches for the other sections, with some<br/>of the intervallic relationships also deriving from 144-tET<br/>and its various subets such as 24-, 36-, 48-, and 72-tET.</p><p>In general, I used a lattice diagram with the nearest implied<br/>144-tET pitches plugged into the ratio-places as a guidepost<br/>in getting out of my MIDI sequencer what I heard in my head.<br/>The JI implications were basically an 11-limit system, and<br/>I assumed the listener could ignore the small differences<br/>between my pitch-bend values, which were based on 144-tET,<br/>and the implied JI ratios - I&apos;d have to go back into my sketches<br/>and score for the piece to say exactly how large an error it<br/>is, but it is on the order of max error = ~4 cents.</p><p>In parts of the piece where a sustaining of the harmony<br/>made me want strict JI pitches, I tweaked the pitch-bend<br/>values to get them.  Again, I&apos;d have to rummage thru the<br/>score and compare it with the MIDI file to describe this<br/>more precisely.  Perhaps I&apos;ll get around to adding it to<br/>the webpage someday, or better still, maybe someone else<br/>out there would be interested in analyzing what I did...?</p><p>The MIDI file of the instrumental parts is available on the<br/>webpage.  I performed the vocal extemporaneously at the<br/>Microthon!, but it was based almost entirely on a composed<br/>part that I never bothered to figure out how to notate.</p><p>I do eventually plan to put at least an excerpt from the<br/>score up on the webpage.</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/spider/spider.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/spider/spider.htm</a></p><p>BTW, hope to see some of you Monday night at the AFMM<br/>concert.  I&apos;m very excited about hearing the Sandberg Psalm,<br/>Johnny&apos;s &apos;Middle Earth&apos; symphony, and the Pythagorean<br/>version of &apos;Unanswered Question&apos;.  As always, I think it<br/>would be great to have a dinner get-together after the show.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
