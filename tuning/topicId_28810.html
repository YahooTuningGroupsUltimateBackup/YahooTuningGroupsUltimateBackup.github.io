Why is this post a cheat?<br/>Ivor cutler is a &quot;humorist&quot;, I suppose, but he is really<br/>unclassifiable as an artist. Why is it cheating *a bit*? Because he<br/>accompanies himself on the m&apos;bira for some of his work, and it is not<br/>quite in 12tet. I find him really interesting. You can get some of his<br/>work on <a href="http://www.audiogalaxy.com">http://www.audiogalaxy.com</a></p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
