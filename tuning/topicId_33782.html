Note that his book takes a much more JI approach to<br/>&gt; what music and musicians do, even implying the use of 11 and 13<br/>&gt; limit entities in the performance of &quot;in tune&quot; Western music. Since<br/>&gt; this doesn&apos;t match at all what I hear, I have some scepticism about<br/>&gt; theorizing he may make, regardless of the quality of his choral<br/>&gt; directing.<br/>&gt;<br/>I join you in that skepticism, Bob. I learned a lot during my months on the<br/>list. Too bad I can&apos;t go back and modify all the copies of my books. At<br/>least I&apos;ll be a bit more cautious in any future writing.</p><p>&gt; He came to this list in search of the &quot;high third&quot; (which he<br/>&gt; seemed to believe was a third that would &apos;lock&apos; IN ADDITION to<br/>&gt; the 5/4, beat-free third). After listening to a bunch of major<br/>&gt; triads, the one he seemed to believe best matched his experience<br/>&gt; had a third of around 404c. (He did seem to think that 408 was<br/>&gt; too high).</p><p>That&apos;s what I remember.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It may well be that all of Western music theory should be based<br/>&gt; on<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 9/8 24/19 4/3 3/2 32/19 36/19<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or casting it into a 12 tone system<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 19/18 9/8 19/6 24/19 4/3 27/19 3/2 19/12 32/19 57/32 36/19<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; with a 3 and 19 lattice<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Db   Ab   Eb   Bb<br/>&gt;    F    C    G    D<br/>&gt;         A    E    B     F#<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and that {3,19} is the spiritual coupling with all of creation<br/>&gt; rather than just little integers, but thats probably a different<br/>&gt; discussion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Valentine</p><p>While I find the further search among number ratios interesting, I suspect<br/>the &quot;explanation&quot; of the high third lies elsewhere--perhaps in the<br/>physiology of hearing.
