Writing from Weimar in 1827, Hummel<br/>looks back at &lsquo;former times&rsquo; when clavichords, harpsichords, pantalons, and<br/>even pianofortes had &lsquo;only two thin, feeble strings&rsquo; for each note (p. 458),<br/>and authors such as Sorge, Fritz, Marpurg, Kirnberger, and Georg Joseph<br/>Vogler[i] (1749-1814) set forth practical systems about tuning.  But modern tuners,<br/>Hummel claims, don&rsquo;t have ears acute enough to discriminate the minute<br/>deviations in the tuning systems proposed by these authors.  Now, according to Hummel,<br/>those early keyboard instruments are &lsquo;almost wholly set aside&rsquo;; and with<br/>pianofortes whose strings are four to five times thicker, a temperament is needed<br/>that will make tuning much easier and more convenient&rdquo; (McGeery, p. 114).</p><p>            Hummel claimed that according to professional tuners, especially<br/>those in Vienna, equal temperament was used for it was &ldquo;the one that is most<br/>easily tuned, and by which the whole instrument is tuned with the greatest<br/>certainty and probability of keeping in tune&rdquo; (McGeery, p. 114).  And yet, Hummel<br/>fully acknowledged that music still retained unequal tuning in theory.  The<br/>unequal semitones would always remanin important as a basis for music even<br/>though the limitations of the piano presented equal sized semitones in the actual<br/>sounds heard.</p><p>[i] According to Rita Steblin, &ldquo;Vogler&rsquo;s key descriptions are filled with<br/>references to colour and painting.  For example, C major &lsquo;is perhaps the key<br/>most fit for a painting, for pure water arias&rsquo; (1779; G major is used<br/>successfully to depict &lsquo;a bright landscape painting&rsquo; (1812); E major &lsquo;can depict fire<br/>best of all&rsquo; (1770); Ab major is &lsquo;black (1812); Eb major has &ldquo;a monopoly over<br/>night pictures&rsquo; (1812)&rdquo; (Steblin, p. 129).</p><p>I got the 1851 date from the memory of the published English translation of<br/>Hummel&apos;s treatise.<br/>&gt; It was in the middle of the *nineteenth* century, not the twentieth.<br/>&gt; Is this sarcasm?</p><p>No. I don&apos;t think assumptions about orchestras in 1960 hold for<br/>orchestras in 1860.</p><p>This is my life&apos;s work, determining the proper tuning for each composer&apos;s<br/>composition.  I would like you to hear the new EARLY album as an example.  It is<br/>on CD Baby and I believe you can hear excerpts on the Internet.  Still,<br/>sometimes a composer is actually in equal temperament.

The<br/>complex chromatic alterations of chords in Tristan, together with the<br/>constant shifting of key, the telescoping of resolutions, and the<br/>blurring of progressions by means of suspensions and other<br/>non-harmonic tones, produces a novel, ambiguous kind of tonality, one<br/>that can be explained only with difficulty in terms of the harmonic<br/>system of Bach, Handel, Mozart, and Beethoven. This departure from the<br/>Classical conception of tonality in such a conspicuous and musically<br/>successful work can today be viewed historically as the first step on<br/>the way toward new systems of harmony which marked the development of<br/>music after 1890.&quot;</p><p>This is (presumably) the &apos;party line&apos; that irks you so much, but it<br/>seems to explain the effect of Wagner&apos;s music, not only at the time<br/>but in it&apos;s ongoing ripples, better than the tenuous attempts to<br/>ascertain particular intonation aspects of isolated chords. I would<br/>also couple this with one of your particular tendencies: to revere<br/>works that are not necessarily forward thinking but thoroughly<br/>grounded in some existing or preceding language. Had Wagner the<br/>unfortunate circumstance of posting now on the tuning list, I can<br/>easily see you complaining that his harmonic ideas were exercising<br/>originality at the expense of the music.</p><p>But that would be pure speculation on my part.</p><p>If you feel that the importance of the Tristan chord (and that being<br/>only a signpost in Wagner&apos;s overall expansion of tonal and harmonic<br/>resources) in the advancement (or expansion) of the Western harmonic<br/>idiom, you are going to have to come up with a compelling alternate<br/>theory.

What does the Tristan chord have to do with<br/>constant<br/>&gt; shifting of keys, etc?</p><p>Not all that much on its own, but it has been seen as an *emblem* of<br/>the radical expansion of harmonic vocabulary (interpolation of chord<br/>sequences in distant keys) most obvious in Tristan and Parsifal. It is<br/>in one way a fitting emblem because, considered within traditional mid-<br/>19th century harmony, it is more at home in D# minor than in the tonic<br/>A minor. The augmented and diminished chords do not have quite the<br/>same significance because, although they are unstable, they are just<br/>as much at home in the tonic as in the distant tonality, so they are<br/>neutral with respect to harmonic wandering (rather than positively<br/>promoting it).</p><p>Actually, I rarely have any difficulty with hearing tonality in the<br/>background of Tristan, but the style of writing does lend itself<br/>easily to a quite atonal result, for example some of Reger or<br/>Zemlinsky which meanders round in apparently aimless fashion.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=58474 href="#58474">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2005 6:11:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;tdent@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The Meistersinger overture is not at all representative of Wagner&apos;s<br/>&gt; developments of tonality, being almost all in fairly diatonic major<br/>&gt; keys with a few mildly interesting modulations.

Take a<br/>listen to the opening of Das Rheingold, for gosh sakes. Moreover, it<br/>changes key all over the map and is *not* in fact stuck in C major.</p><p>&gt; Now, how about the prelude to act II of Walkure, or the Magic Fire<br/>&gt; Music (end of the last scene)? Or, to really push the boat out, the<br/>&gt; preludes to Acts II and III of Parsifal.</p><p>I&apos;ve finished the prelude to Tristan und Isolde, which sounds *damn<br/>fine* in meantone IMHO. I plan on putting up a Wagner in Meantone<br/>webpage so people can make up their own mind about whether you can<br/>listen to Wagner in meantone. Next I was going to do &quot;Lebwohl, Du<br/>Liebe!&quot;, which I have a preliminary version (key changes only) of.</p></div><h3><a id=58475 href="#58475">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2005 6:32:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;tdent@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Actually, I rarely have any difficulty with hearing tonality in the<br/>&gt; background of Tristan, but the style of writing does lend itself<br/>&gt; easily to a quite atonal result, for example some of Reger or<br/>&gt; Zemlinsky which meanders round in apparently aimless fashion.</p><p>I agree--Tristan is simply extended tonality, not tonal mush.
