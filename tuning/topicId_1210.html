Could you give me the exact 31TET<br/>intervals of the chord you&apos;re describing?<br/>&gt; I think most people would prefer those in something meantonish, in the<br/>&gt; 1/4 or 1/5 comma range, though IIRC (and I&apos;m not positive that I do)<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich has advocated something closer to 2/7 comma.  I lean<br/>&gt; towards 1/4 myself--again, me being a 31-toner, that&apos;s probably not<br/>&gt; surprising.<br/>Please forgive my ignorance of terms in common use: what does IIRC stand<br/>for?<br/>Paul, thanks for introducing me to the term &quot;Adaptive JI&quot; - that<br/>describes well what my program does.</p><p>In Digest 73, Paul H. Erlich writes:<br/>&gt; I too believe slight glissandos are necessary for JI transcription of<br/>&gt; ordinary music, particularly to avoid drifting or shifting by a<br/>&gt; syntonic comma in the course of a I-IV-ii-V-I or I-vi-ii-V-I<br/>&gt; progression.  How does your program handle these?<br/>In fact, though I mentioned only two, there are three things my program<br/>considers:<br/>   . The pain of changing the tuning of a note previously (or<br/>     continuously) sounding.<br/>   . The pain of any chord being out of tune (as measured by considering<br/>     all pairs of notes sounding).<br/>   . The pain of &quot;drift&quot;: when the average tuning shift of all notes<br/>     sounding moves either above or below zero.<br/>This last counteracts the tendency of the progressions you mention to<br/>pump the tuning downward (or upward, when reversed).<br/>&gt; When you&apos;re done, maybe we can make a program that renders 22-tone<br/>&gt; compositions in 7-limit JI!<br/>I need to review the math of 22TET, but, assuming that each interval<br/>there has a 1:1 mapping with a corresponding JI interval, such a<br/>translation would be very easy, and would not involve actually casting<br/>about for different JI interpretations.  Alternatively, the program<br/>could be made to take 12TET into JI and from there into some other ET,<br/>including 22TET.  Though, the &quot;comma pump&quot; chord sequence you mention<br/>can&apos;t be easily resolved in any ET that &quot;supports a comma&quot; (which, it<br/>appears, 22TET DOES, and 31TET, oddly, does NOT).</p><p>In Digest 73, Dave Hill writes:<br/>&gt; I found that in cases of four stacked fourths, making the fourths just<br/>&gt; and letting the minor third between the ends of the stack be 32/27 -<br/>&gt; a Pythagorean minor third sounded fine, even when there was some<br/>&gt; &quot;bite&quot; of beating between the notes of the 32/27.<br/>I actually haven&apos;t tried that, but will!<br/>&gt; Fifths or fourths off by much more than 5 cents begin to get<br/>&gt; conspicuous quickly in the kind of music I&apos;ve worked with - at least<br/>&gt; they sound conspicuous to me and to a lot of people.<br/>I agree.  The error of 2 cents in 12TET isn&apos;t bad, but I&apos;m reluctant to<br/>shrink fifths by much more.<br/>Thanks for your thoughts on full diminished seventh and augmented<br/>triads.</p><p>In Digest 74, Carl Lumma writes:<br/>&gt;&gt; Chords such as full diminished 7ths and augmented triads, creatures<br/>&gt;&gt; of equal temperament, my software simply leaves tuned in equal<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament.<br/>&gt; Have you considered 10-12-14-17 (or, in some cases, 9-11-13-15) for<br/>&gt; the diminished 7th?<br/>No I haven&apos;t; thanks for the suggestion!<br/>&gt; The augmented triad can be more tricky.  Here&apos;s a list of<br/>&gt; possibilities, all of them smoother than 3tET to my ear...<br/>&gt; 1)The &quot;literal&quot; translation, 1/1-5/4-25/16, pretty tense<br/>&gt; 2)&quot;Classical&quot; version, 1/1-5/4-8/5, very similar to #1<br/>&gt; 3)1/1-5/4-19/12, still spacy enough for most applications<br/>&gt; 4)8-10-13, too smooth for many applications<br/>Thanks for the suggestions; I&apos;ll try them!<br/>&gt;&gt; Other problem chords, such as those with four or more notes forming<br/>&gt;&gt; consecutive fifths, may also be tuned in 12-tone, in which fifths<br/>&gt;&gt; aren&apos;t too bad, and thirds are at least preferable to those generated<br/>&gt;&gt; in 3-limit tuning!<br/>&gt; True, but do the 3rds matter as much as the 5ths?<br/>I agree that 3rds don&apos;t matter as much as 5ths, but the error in 12TET<br/>fifths is not particularly objectionable to my ear.</p><p>In the next few months, I hope to have a web site up and running, from<br/>which the Adaptive JI program I&apos;m porting from NeXT to PC/Windows95 will<br/>be downloadable.  As time permits, I will try to include options for<br/>tuning the output to xxTET, as chosen by the listener.</p><p>Again, thanks for the feedback!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=1219 href="#1219">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@xxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/1999 10:06:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, 3 Mar 1999, John deLaubenfels wrote:<br/>&gt; In Digest 72, Paul Hahn writes:<br/>&gt;&gt; I agree about the augmented triads, but (being a 31-toner) I kind of<br/>&gt;&gt; like the way full diminished 7ths come out in 31TET, with the<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;augmented second&quot; going to 7:6 and the tritones going to 7:5s or<br/>&gt;&gt; 10:7s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I need to review the math of 31TET.
