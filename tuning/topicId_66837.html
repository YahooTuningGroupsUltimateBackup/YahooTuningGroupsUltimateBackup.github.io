Or the fifth raised and the octave lowered?</p><p>I want to say &quot;double temperament&quot;, which I Googled for, but found no pertinent results.</p><p>Bohlen-Pierce is an example, if understood as having a fifth of 32/21 (raised by a septimal comma) and an octave of 64/33 (lowered by the same). Another is 49 equal divisions of a twelfth which I&apos;ve proposed as an alternative to 31-tET; it has a slightly better fifth but a slightly worse fourth.</p><p>I also came up with a 9-tone scale with a fifth of 40/27 (lowered by a syntonic comma) and an octave of 81/40 (raised by the same):</p><p>0: 0.000 (1/1)<br/>1: 139.391 (64000/59049)<br/>2: 278.782<br/>3: 401.666 (129140163/102400000)<br/>4: 541.058 (2187/1600)<br/>5: 680.449 (40/27)<br/>6: 819.840 (2560000/1594323)<br/>7: 942.724<br/>8: 1082.115 (4782969/2560000)<br/>9: 1221.506 (81/40)</p><p>... a bad &quot;pelog&quot; tuning. This is also close to 14 equal divisions of a twelfth, or 53-tET using every sixth note. A 13-limit JI version is 1/1 13/12 7/6 33/26 11/8 40/27 8/5 26/15 15/8 81/40. (14/11 could be used in place of 33/26, but it deviates from ET a bit much.)</p><p>~Danny~</p></div>
