Still a load of work (and for<br/>&gt;me, a lot of waiting) but it would be _possible_ to retune instruments or<br/>&gt;their partials in a polyphonic file.</p><p>Well, first, let me never find myself in the position of saying<br/>&quot;never&quot;...</p><p>The primary difficulty is that of<br/>determining which partials go with which notes.<br/>(This is necessary because otherwise you are scrambling up the<br/>partials from different voices).<br/>The process is simple enough to envision - e.g.,<br/>find the fundamentals, then identify a harmonic series<br/>above each fundamental (assuming the sounds have known<br/>harmonic spectrum). However, it is very tricky to make work.</p><p>Im sure you are aware that all the commercially available<br/>pitch detecting software (and hardware, like the antares)<br/>works only on monophonic<br/>sources - this is why, say, MIDI guitars need special pickups -<br/>to isolate the sound from each string for separate processing<br/>for the pitch detection process.</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div>
