This would help me greatly in planning some of<br/>the composition I plan to do in 22 tet.</p><p>I have found Paul&apos;s paper to be most edifying and would liken it to a<br/>treatise on the anatomy of the temperament. What would be of great<br/>benefit to me now is a detailed manual of physiology, ie an<br/>understanding of the inner workings of the  temperament, what it can and<br/>can&apos;t do harmonically, which progressions are convincing and which<br/>aren&apos;t and why, in clear terms. I don&apos;t expect anyone to write this<br/>manual for me but I have a clear idea as to what needs to be explained.<br/>So I&apos;ll ask the questions as I go.</p><p>What is needed in the long run is something similar to Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&quot;Theory&quot; (don&apos;t laugh - it&apos;s a tall order I know),  starting with<br/>connecting triads, then progressions, presumably decatonic rather than<br/>diatonic, all the time taking account of spacings, inversions, cadences<br/>and voice leading. Then tetrads, and presumably the 22tet equivalents of<br/>vagrants and extended chords.</p><p>But going back to my first point, I&apos;d like to propose something similar<br/>to Vincent Persichetti&apos;s suggestion regarding the naming of intervals in<br/>12 tet.<br/>He suggests the following : -</p><p>perfect fifths and octaves - open consonances<br/>major and minor thirds and sixths - soft consonances<br/>minor seconds and major sevenths - sharp dissonances<br/>major seconds and minor sevenths - mild dissonances<br/>perfect fourth - consonant or dissonant (depending on context)<br/>tritone - ambiguous, can be either neutral or restless</p><p>For argument&apos;s sake I&apos;m quite happy to stick with descriptive terms like<br/>these  for just now.  I have a chart with all the tones from 1/1 (with<br/>in some cases as many as three names for each tone). The first problem<br/>is that I have Paul&apos;s suggestions, all decatonic intervals, for example<br/>step 18 (7/4 approx.) is an major 9 or diminished 10, both names with a<br/>small ten subscript after the name to indicate decatonic. I also have<br/>this as a minor 7 with a small seven superscript to indicate septimal<br/>and as the harmonic seventh. Step 19 (20/11 approx.) is a decatonic<br/>augmented 9 or minor 10, a minor 7 with an 11 superscript after it or a<br/>large minor 7, again with an 11 superscript.</p><p>All are quite acceptable, but before I elicit suggestions for the level<br/>of consonance/dissonance for each interval I&apos;d like to ask if there is<br/>any good reason NOT to choose to relate the intervals as far as possible<br/>in the first instance to the familiar names, so that a 4/3 approx, ie<br/>step 9, is 4th  rather than a decatonic perfect 5th. I anticipate that<br/>only Paul will pitch in to this discussion and that he will want to go<br/>with his suggestions which is quite understandable. I do envisage a<br/>scenario however where I might write for string quartet and it would<br/>make much more sense to have a terminology consistent with convention<br/>when I come to discuss music with players.</p><p>Once (if) we can settle this then I&apos;d like to move on to the<br/>consonance/dissonance terminology.</p><p>Kind Regards<br/>a.m.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2002 7:12:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But going back to my first point, I&apos;d like to propose something<br/>similar<br/>&gt; to Vincent Persichetti&apos;s suggestion regarding the naming of<br/>intervals in<br/>&gt; 12 tet.<br/>&gt; He suggests the following : -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; perfect fifths and octaves - open consonances<br/>&gt; major and minor thirds and sixths - soft consonances<br/>&gt; minor seconds and major sevenths - sharp dissonances<br/>&gt; major seconds and minor sevenths - mild dissonances<br/>&gt; perfect fourth - consonant or dissonant (depending on context)<br/>&gt; tritone - ambiguous, can be either neutral or restless</p><p>i remember this well -- i gobbled up &quot;Twentieth Century Harmony&quot; way<br/>back when, in my high school library.</p><p>&gt; For argument&apos;s sake I&apos;m quite happy to stick with descriptive terms<br/>like<br/>&gt; these  for just now.</p><p>inversions can have more effect on consonance in 7-limit harmony than<br/>they do in 5-limit harmony. chordal context can have a huge effect on<br/>whether a particular interval comes out consonant or dissonant. but<br/>if you wish, i&apos;d be happy to provide such a dyadic &quot;ranking&quot; for 22-<br/>equal. write me on the harmonic entropy list and i&apos;ll try to work up<br/>a formula that satisfies you when applied to 12-equal; then we&apos;ll<br/>quantize to 22-equal instead and see what comes out.</p><p>&gt; I have a chart with all the tones from 1/1 (with<br/>&gt; in some cases as many as three names for each tone).

I appreciate the<br/>points on inversions and context. But I have to start somewhere nonetheless. For my purposes I&apos;d<br/>like to look at chords and progressions from several points of view. On re-reading Persichetti<br/>with  22 tet in mind I quite like the idea of categorising the consonance/dissonance levels of<br/>each interval, six in a tetrad, but obviously in 22 tet there are more possible interval types. I<br/>find the &quot;nondiatonic&quot; approaches to modern 12 tet harmony applicable in some cases to 22 tet and<br/>it&apos;s given me some good starting points for what I want to achieve, which is something along the<br/>lines of pieces in two, three and four parts, as much for my benefit as for the listener, though<br/>hopefully satisfying to both.</p><p>A further step would be to look at intervals plus the octave. Your second point, chordal context,<br/>I agree with entirely. This is why I&apos;m looking for a firm base - so that I can get a feel for<br/>progressions in motion and for what arises contrapuntally.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I have a chart with all the tones from 1/1 (with<br/>&gt; &gt; in some cases as many as three names for each tone). The first<br/>&gt; problem<br/>&gt; &gt; is that I have Paul&apos;s suggestions, all decatonic intervals, for<br/>&gt; example<br/>&gt; &gt; step 18 (7/4 approx.) is an major 9 or diminished 10, both names<br/>&gt; with a<br/>&gt; &gt; small ten subscript after the name to indicate decatonic.

Step 19 (20/11 approx.) is a decatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; augmented 9 or minor 10, a minor 7 with an 11 superscript after it<br/>&gt; or a<br/>&gt; &gt; large minor 7, again with an 11 superscript.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; All are quite acceptable, but before I elicit suggestions for the<br/>&gt; level<br/>&gt; &gt; of consonance/dissonance for each interval I&apos;d like to ask if there<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; any good reason NOT to choose to relate the intervals as far as<br/>&gt; possible<br/>&gt; &gt; in the first instance to the familiar names, so that a 4/3 approx,<br/>&gt; ie<br/>&gt; &gt; step 9, is 4th  rather than a decatonic perfect 5th.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; one problem with this is that it will quickly lead you into difficult<br/>&gt; morasses when composing. diatonic thinking is conducive to all kinds<br/>&gt; of progressions that don&apos;t work in 22-equal, as you know. the<br/>&gt; quickest way to see this is that a major 2nd plus a perfect 5th does<br/>&gt; not equal a major 6th, or else some similar problem will arise, if<br/>&gt; you try to name the intervals of 22-equal in this way.

Two problems I have:</p><p>- calling 7/6 a major third goes against my better judgement.<br/>- if I wrote a polymicrotonal piece and had several different interval names for an approx 4/3 I&apos;d<br/>be up sh*t street to say the least. I have misgivings about trying to explain these things to<br/>conventionally trained musicians. A completely new system of naming intervals at odds with what<br/>they know might turn them away and God knows it&apos;s hard enough to recruit willing and able bodies.<br/>So I&apos;ll know who to blame : - )</p><p>I look forward to continuing the relevant parts of this discussion on this list.

This whole<br/>project was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, when<br/>they were still doing such things (I think in the 60&apos;s as I recall...)</p><p>J.P.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/22/2002 12:27:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41132">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41132</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; right -- it&apos;s just the smoothness of the sound, not taking into<br/>&gt; &gt; account tonal function or anything like that. blackwood&apos;s<br/>favorite<br/>&gt; &gt; example is the dominant seventh when tuned close to 4:5:6:7 (as<br/>in<br/>&gt; 22-equal) -- he says it&apos;s concordant, but not consonant: it&apos;s<br/>&gt; dissonant because tonal function demands that dominant seventh<br/>chords<br/>&gt; act as dissonances (tonal function of course being built off the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale) . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***I believe then, Paul, that this identical situation applies to<br/>the<br/>&gt; Blackjack tetrads, correct??  They are seventh chords that are<br/>&gt; essentially *static*, concordances, and don&apos;t really need<br/>&gt; to &quot;resolve&quot; to anything, right??  They didn&apos;t seem to, as I recall.</p><p>well, blackwood would dispute that. he insists on treating dominant<br/>seventh chords as dissonances, and tends to resolve them<br/>traditionally, no matter how concordantly they&apos;re tuned!</p><p>&gt; I also have the score now.
