As I<br/>recall, Partch originally wrote for a Yeats translation, but he was forced to<br/>abandon it by Yeats&apos; heirs.  There were 2 rewritings, based on a public domain<br/>Sophocles text.  It may be that the Sophocles text doesn&apos;t hold up as well to<br/>Partch&apos;s original vision.</p><p>I have the Yeats recording done at Mills College and find it immensely<br/>enjoyable.  Yes, it is audio only and there are some really bad college actors<br/>(whew).  Still, I return to it and would love to see that production done.  If<br/>fact, I tried to present that production about 15 years ago, but was blocked by<br/>Mr. Mitchell, who always claimed the production would be hopeless without the<br/>original instruments.  This is the only denial I ever received in doing<br/>microtonal music throughout my career (except for Marvel Comics turning down and idea<br/>for an opera based on two of its characters they believed headed for<br/>hollywood.  They haven&apos;t).</p><p>Somehow, later instrumental scores for the new/old text of Sophocles do not<br/>have the &quot;holding power&quot; of the orignal Yeats.  Not every transcription is an<br/>improvement.  Same holds for &quot;Ulysses Departs From the Edge of the World&quot; for<br/>trumpet, double bass and boobams.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2005 10:22:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I have the Yeats recording done at Mills College and find it immensely<br/>&gt;enjoyable.</p><p>Ditto.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2005 10:27:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And isn&apos;t putting the orchestra in a pit mistake number One?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>***Well, Carl, I *personally* thought so, and even though I was in<br/>the<br/>very front of the auditorium and almost within arms length of the<br/>diamond marimba and the cloud chamber bowls, it was dark there with<br/>only illuminated music stands...</p><p>JP</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/3/2005 10:59:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; And isn&apos;t putting the orchestra in a pit mistake number One?</p><p>Information isn&apos;t being reported correctly.
