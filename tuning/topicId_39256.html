My Gardner Read book _20th Century Microtonal<br/>Notation_ arrived.  After a quick glance, it looks really excellent.</p><p>Nice compilation of different notations, of course, *but* with a fair<br/>amound or readable background and interpretation.</p><p>I was happy to see Johnny Reinhard and the American Festival of<br/>Microtonal Music get such a prominent mention in this book.  I guess<br/>Johnny helped Read find notational examples...</p><p>Read discusses 6th and 12th tones and, very briefly, the Ezra Sims<br/>notation that I, personally, use for 72 equal.  I guess I was a<br/>little disappointed that at the end where he &quot;predicts&quot; different<br/>systems for the future, he mentions, naturally 19, 31 and 53 but<br/>doesn&apos;t mention 72.</p><p>I think the very clear and practical relation of 72 to 12 equal<br/>should have been touched upon since, at least for me, it&apos;s of great<br/>importance.</p><p>I guess, too, I paid too much for this book.  This is a pretty<br/>expensive book for it&apos;s length.  I&apos;ve promptly forgotten how much I<br/>actually *did* pay, but it was too much...</p><p>Quite a bit of mention of many composers, actually quite a few whom I<br/>know personally that I haven&apos;t *specifically* associated with<br/>the &quot;microtonal movement...&quot;  Lots of composers, obviously, are using<br/>microtonality nowadays, at least quartertones...</p><p>Looks like quite a good &quot;Read&quot;....</p><p>J. Pehrson</p></div>
