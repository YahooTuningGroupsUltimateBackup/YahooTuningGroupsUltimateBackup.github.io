Entropy says 5/3 should be more<br/>consonant, while product says 7/2 (7*2 = 14 &lt; 5*3 = 15). So it looks like in<br/>applying the &quot;rule of thumb&quot; we&apos;ll have to reduce the thumb from 99 to 14,<br/>not 98 (assuming this particular value of s is relevant in the situation at<br/>hand; and, needless to say, that the harmonic entropy model correctly<br/>predicts experience).</p><p>But the general correlation between product and entropy continues on up to<br/>about a product of 35, after which it begins to &quot;unravel&quot;. By far the worst<br/>exception below 100 is 11/9, at the end of an extremely anomalous &quot;arm&quot; that<br/>includes 18/5 and 12/7. 11/9 has a product of 99, and 18/5 a product of 90,<br/>but both have an entropy lower than that of 8/5 (product 40).</p></div><h3><a id=18644 href="#18644">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
