There is no standard &quot;12-tone Just Major&quot; and &quot;12-<br/>tone Just Minor&quot; in tuning theory. Electronic keyboard manufacturers<br/>will tend to include a few just scales, along with the historically<br/>and geographically more important scales, but you aren&apos;t likely to<br/>find total agreement between manufacturers on how these scales are<br/>constructed. Monz has latticed a few possibilities out for you; as he<br/>(and probably you) knows, there are many other possibilities that fit<br/>just as well onto a 12-tone keyboard. Generally, these will all be<br/>examples of a 12-tone periodicity block . . .</p></div><h3><a id=25380 href="#25380">ðŸ”—</a>arl_123@hotmail.com</h3><span>6/20/2001 5:37:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for the replies, Monz and P.
