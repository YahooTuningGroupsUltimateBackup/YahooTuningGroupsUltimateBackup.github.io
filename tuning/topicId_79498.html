Then again, I&apos;ve been listening to my scale so long<br/>my ears might be &quot;hypnotized&quot; and hopelessly biased...so please listen<br/>and let me know what you think.</p></div><h3><a id=79505 href="#79505">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2008 3:21:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;djtrancendance&quot; &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks to Carl Lumma for suggesting this comparison/idea: :-)<br/>&gt; __________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; Here is the exact same short preview melody/sample in<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My 7-note scale:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.geocities.com/djtrancendance/binaural/binaural8.mp3">http://www.geocities.com/djtrancendance/binaural/binaural8.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 12TET:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.geocities.com/djtrancendance/binaural/binaural8_12TET.mp3">http://www.geocities.com/djtrancendance/binaural/binaural8_12TET.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Harmonic Series (harmonics 7-21 approx. 7 notes per octave)<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.geocities.com/djtrancendance/binaural/binaural8_harm.mp3">http://www.geocities.com/djtrancendance/binaural/binaural8_harm.mp3</a></p><p>Hooray!</p><p>You know, it&apos;s completely not the point of it, but in testing<br/>these I played them back to back.
