The notes<br/>die away too soon to be able to hear anything<br/>slower very clearly.  Also, the precision of the<br/>tuning is limited to that provided by the<br/>mechanical advantage of the tuning pegs - the<br/>screw is an adaptation of the principle of the<br/>lever.</p><p>When tuning a guitar, I tune the low E string<br/>to a reference pitch, of whatever instrument<br/>I&apos;m playing with, then tune up in fourths and<br/>a third.  In so doing, I adjust each string until<br/>it vibrates sympathetically with the stopped<br/>string below it.  For example, in tuning the<br/>second string, the A, I stop the low E string on<br/>the fifth fret to produce a pure 12-EDO A.<br/>I then tune the A string until playing the A on<br/>the low string makes the second string vibrate<br/>sympathetically.  It does this so well that the<br/>motion is clearly visible (even in a noisy and<br/>crowded room).  To confirm the note is good,<br/>I pluck, and then damp, the lower string; the<br/>higher string should continue to vibrate,<br/>producing a clear, ringing tone.  Because the<br/>sympathetic vibration occurs, not just exactly<br/>at the exciting pitch, but across a narrow band<br/>of pitches, and more strongly in the middle of<br/>that band, if the sympathetic vibration is weak,<br/>I could see (even with earplugs in) that the note<br/>is not near enough to correct.</p><p>But this is just the beginning! :-)  If the room&apos;s<br/>not TOO noisy, I can clearly hear whether the<br/>higher string is sharp or flat, and will adjust it<br/>accordingly.  I won&apos;t leave a small difference,<br/>that corresponds to about a twentieth of a turn<br/>of the tuning peg, or less.  It seems to be about<br/>the same as a difference of two cents that I<br/>hear when adjusting the tuning on my Roland<br/>keyboard.</p><p>Finally, having tuned all strings in pairs, I play<br/>some simple test chords: E and G major, and<br/>check that there are no strong beats; then A<br/>and E minor, and check that the beats are not<br/>objectionable.</p><p>However, within chords, the beat rates you&apos;re<br/>listening for aren&apos;t those between supposed<br/>unisons, but between overtones of the chord<br/>tones.  These are often weaker.  Playing a 3:2<br/>interval, eg E3:A3, also involves playing the<br/>second overtone of the 3 (E3) and the third<br/>overtone of the 2 (A3), which _should_ coincide<br/>at E4.  Depending on the harmonic spectrum of<br/>the instrument, and also on the relative height<br/>of the chord voicing, these partials may not be<br/>strong enough to produce noticeable beating<br/>even when slightly mistuned.  Even with perfect<br/>hearing (such as most eight-year-olds have), in<br/>fast music there simply isn&apos;t time for beats to<br/>be heard.</p><p>Just for fun, I tried listening to my lowest<br/>tuned pair, at A3, for as long as it would ring.<br/>It lasted about ten or twelve seconds, and in<br/>that time, I heard no rhythmic variation.<br/>Since that is around 220 Hz, and according to<br/>your calculations above, I should have heard<br/>three cycles of a 2-cent variation, if one were<br/>present.</p><p>What I did hear, though, was that the _timbre_<br/>of the unison changed continuously; in the end,<br/>it favoured the higher overtones, becoming<br/>lighter.  I guess the lower partials are being<br/>damped more quickly?  When I checked by<br/>playing just one string at a time, the same<br/>effect was there.  But the net result was a<br/>curious effect of the tone changing in pitch,<br/>like a (very slow) &quot;smear&quot; or glide.  This, I hasten<br/>to add, was in a very QUIET room, late on<br/>Christmas Day, when everyone but me (even the<br/>cat) was asleep in bed.  Curious!  I don&apos;t know<br/>enough about guitar acoustics to explain this<br/>with any confidence.</p><p>Your observation, about the jnd being related<br/>to the octave (pitch range) you&apos;re in, makes<br/>sense to me.  We all have greater difficulty in<br/>discriminating low pitches.  Your figures, of 8<br/>to 17 seconds for the period of beats with a<br/>2-cent error at 50 to 100 Hz, explains why we<br/>hear a wider range of low pitches as being &quot;the<br/>same&quot;.</p><p>[snip]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; [Shaahin, earlier]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; As I&apos;m searching for jnd of pitch perception and you wrote about 2<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; cent, and as it is mentioned in theoretical texts about jnd of 5 cent,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; may you guide me with your refrence about jnd of 2 cent?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [snip]<br/>&gt; &gt; [Yahya, earlier]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The difference, 2 cents, is about the agreed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limit of our ability to perceive.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My guide in this matter has been mostly some<br/>&gt; &gt; discussions I&apos;ve had with Paul Erlich over the<br/>&gt; &gt; last few months.  I do not remember whether<br/>&gt; &gt; they were on this list, or in private email.  But<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m sure that Paul, or one of the other list<br/>&gt; &gt; members, will be able to quote a suitable<br/>&gt; &gt; reference for this fact.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My own experience tells me that I can readily<br/>&gt; &gt; discern intervals smaller than 5 cents in slow<br/>&gt; &gt; music with timbres of moderate complexity.<br/>&gt; &gt; What does your ear tell you?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.371 / Virus Database: 267.14.7/214 - Release Date: 23/12/05</p></div>
