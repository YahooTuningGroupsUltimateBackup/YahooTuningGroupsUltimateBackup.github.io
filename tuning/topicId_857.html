The only work that I know of in<br/>the area of explicit adaptive tuning is Sethares&apos;, and I have said many<br/>times how cool I think it is.  But, as I have also said, I feel that the<br/>inharmonic timbres and chords lack a quality that I find in harmonic<br/>timbres and chords (and although I haven&apos;t done enough listening to say for<br/>sure, my first reaction has been that justly-tuned subharmonic chords also<br/>lack this quality).  I don&apos;t know why this is.  I was speculating, and I<br/>may have gotten these from Sethares&apos; book or posts to the list, that it<br/>could be one or both of...</p><p>*)That our mind-ear, having evolved to recognize spoken language, might<br/>have many routines that assume harmonic timbres, since the human voice<br/>fairly harmonic, and in fact vowels are to a great extent the selection of<br/>certain harmonics from it.</p><p>*)That roughness curves, when adjusted for combination tones, may show a<br/>preference for harmonics, or at for least some sort of additive series.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Anyhow, do you think the minor third in the minor key is not part of the<br/>&gt;&gt;phenomenon of harmonic tonality?</p><p>Its function in the minor key is strictly a matter of melodic tonality, as<br/>far as I&apos;m concerned.  I have reservations about the term &quot;melodic<br/>tonality&quot; because the stimulus P need not be melodic.  In fact I think of<br/>&quot;key&quot; as being a spec for relating harmonic and scalar stimuli.  So in a<br/>way &quot;harmonic tonality&quot; is part of &quot;key&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure how to measure the &quot;key effects&quot; in a sample of music.  I said<br/>that Rothenberg comes as close as I know.  Also close are Wilson,<br/>Boomsliter and Creel, and you (Paul Erlich).  For &quot;harmonic tonality<br/>effects&quot;, I will accept a list of, at each beat in the music, the top three<br/>most likely fundamentals and their relative probabilities.  This is lifted<br/>right from you.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
