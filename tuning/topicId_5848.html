A Columbus Day Orchestra<br/>Concert &quot;Discovering New Worlds&quot; by the AFMM Orchestra took place at the School for<br/>Ethical Culture in Manhattan on October 11, 1999.  My prior exposure to an<br/>orchestra playing microtonally was limited only to hearing Ives Universe Symphony<br/>conducted by Johnny Reinhard and soon afterwards Johnny&#xFFFD;s 60 player improvisatory<br/>feat on Homer&#xFFFD;s Odyssey at St. Paul&#xFFFD;s Chapel on the Columbia University Campus.</p><p>    The 26 piece orchestra that pulled off the event were top notch players many of<br/>whom I recognized from my attendance at numerous microtonal chamber music events<br/>and other new music concerts. Conductor Paolo Bellomia assumed the podium and the<br/>evening opened with Alyssa Ryvers Hologram. A disarming folk tune was presented on<br/>solo piccolo that was soon joined by flutes. Before long every instrument was<br/>engaged in a canonic treatment of the tune at micro-transposed intervals. Once the<br/>whole texture was in place the effect was fairly grotesque. At that point I could<br/>not perceive any sense of phrasing or contrast until the tune returned at the end<br/>and yet, because I knew that musicians of this caliber were virtually incapable of<br/>playing out-of -tune in the normal sense I felt that in their willingness to<br/>submerge personal ego to the composers message I got to hear something new, strange<br/>and different.</p><p>    Luc Marcel I had heard before on a prior AFMM concert and I anticipated a work<br/>of great energy and complexity. Mod&#xFFFD;le 312, the second premiere of the evening was<br/>exactly that. His writing was muscular and breathless, driven by angular<br/>asymmetries of percussion. Phrases seemed to tumble into each other relentlessly.<br/>At first his music seemed rather Varese-like but unlike Varese an exhausting,<br/>frantic energy pervaded relieved though by some touches of humor when the<br/>percussionist playing a birdwhistle joined the piccolo in an intricate duet. Luc<br/>Marcel was there to take his bow from a sizable audience who appreciated him and<br/>the musicians&#xFFFD; extraordinary skill and energy.</p><p>    Mordecai Sandberg&#xFFFD;s 1944 work, Psalm 51 #2 for Soprano and Orchestra concluded<br/>the first half. According to the program notes the performance utilized two<br/>full-sized keyboard synthesizers required to play all the microtones in the work.<br/>The synths were designed by Patrick Grant and played by Joshua Pierce. On first<br/>hearing the work had a distinctly Baroque texture but very dense. The soprano<br/>soloist Dorien Verheijden who came from Arnhem, Netherlands to do this work had a<br/>most beautiful voice but she was rather overpowered by the orchestra. Sandberg&#xFFFD;s<br/>creative output was extraordinary and deeply based in his profound knowledge of<br/>Kabbalah. I came upon a quote by Sandberg from a lecture that he gave in 1930 in<br/>which he says &quot;The music of the world&#xFFFD;s peoples is rife with a confusion of tuning<br/>systems, but in reality there is only one humanity and one music&#xFFFD;&quot; His lifelong<br/>striving to encompass all tuning systems peaks my curiosity about Sandberg and so I<br/>welcome hearing every Sandberg performance just to approach an understanding of<br/>this composer.</p><p>     After the intermission Jon Catler appeared as soloist in a premiere<br/>performance of his newest work Evolution for electric Guitar and Orchestra. The<br/>program notes pointed out that the work was in 13-limit Just Intonation and that we<br/>could anticipate hearing the overtone series up to the 16th overtone. .Catler<br/>writes  &quot;this Harmonic Symphony evolves the orchestra into a purely-tuned organism,<br/>capable of enveloping the energy of rock guitar.&quot; Unlike the works on the first<br/>half which were either rather frenetic or extremely dense in texture, Catler kept<br/>exquisite control of a gradually unfolding of sonorities. In his inviting us to<br/>experience intervals and harmonics that might otherwise pass us by quickly I really<br/>did feel as a listener that a compelling sound-world was carefully revealed. The<br/>work was not without rhythmic interest with an intricate tune that appeared<br/>providing an element of contrast and formal shape.</p><p>     Johnny Reinhard&#xFFFD;s Middle-earth, a symphony fantasy inspired by The Lord of the<br/>Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien may be his major accomplishment to date. He loves to work<br/>with programmatic scenarios and his concise notes on the four movements &#xFFFD; Hobbits,<br/>Khazad, Mordor and Eldarin provided much to listen for since he prides himself on<br/>juxtaposing several different tuning approaches in any one composition. On one<br/>hearing it was evident that the work was conceived in detail by the composer, at<br/>once playful and intricate, rich in ideas, moods and  contrasts.  Of all the works<br/>on the program I am most eager to hear a recording of it repeatedly and hopefully,<br/>someday another live performance. Reinhard challenges the sophisticated musician<br/>and thereby the listener who seeks a new experience. His thoroughly knowledgeable<br/>approach is grounded in practical wisdom thus I trust in the integrity of his ideas<br/>and commend the orchestra that can carry them out.</p><p>     The program concluded with Ives Unanswered Question, a work first heard in<br/>1908. Normally it is done with the solo part played on the trumpet but in this<br/>performance Derek Floyd played it on English horm. Great care was taken to adhere<br/>to Ives theoretical conclusion that in a Pythagorean tuning C# is a distinctly<br/>higher pitch than Db. Likewise he asserts that B# is an eighthtone higher than C.<br/>It was a very beautiful rendering of this often heard work, one which shed new<br/>light on aspects of Ives that are only first being understood, Ives the<br/>microtonalist.</p><p>Howard Rovics<br/><a href="mailto:rovics@ct2.nai.net">rovics@ct2.nai.net</a><br/><a href="http://w3.nai.net/~rovics">http://w3.nai.net/~rovics</a></p></div><h3><a id=5863 href="#5863">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I am a good friend of your daughter<br/>Bonnie -- perhaps the microtonal world has only two degrees of separation?<br/>Hope we get to meet sometime. And my the way, several reviews of the<br/>Columbus Day concert were posted just before yours -- check the onelist<br/>archives if you&apos;re interested.</p><p>-Paul Erlich</p></div>
