Again, the otonal triads are shown as solid<br/>triangles.</p><p>Go to <a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/</a> and download dekany.mpg.</p><p>Can you see the dekany as five hexanies? If not, look at hexany.mpg again.<br/>Now go back to dekany.mpg. You should see the same old hexany hiding among<br/>the four new &quot;squashed&quot; hexanies.</p><p>Remember, though, that the dekany only has 10 notes -- not the 30 you might<br/>expect for five hexanies.</p><p>I would have used Jon Szanto&apos;s recommended Alchemy GIF Animator program to<br/>produce a movie that looked cleaner, took up less memory, and repeated<br/>infinitely, but today Matlab refuses to save more than the first frame of<br/>the movie as a valid .bmp. I&apos;ve contacted Matlab support . . .</p></div><h3>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2000 7:58:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich wrote:<br/>&gt;So, Dave, what did you think of my 3)5 dekany movie?</p><p>Great!
