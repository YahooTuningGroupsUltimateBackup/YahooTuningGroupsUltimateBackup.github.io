Because you are not accelerating there<br/>is no physical sensation of motion. You are travelling<br/>within an infinitely long cylindrical solid made of a<br/>transluscent blue-green gel.</p><p>Effervescent bubbles in the gel come up at you and ripple<br/>around your body in shimmering eddies. The gel luminesces<br/>and you feel its wetness. Its temperature matches<br/>your body. Falling falling, down you go across the<br/>universe, past clouds of interstellar matter, past stars,<br/>through perfect blackness. The bubbles in the gel somehow<br/>enable you to breath deeply and slowly, rhythmically.</p><p>Your body has been impaled on a shaft of light that is<br/>being transmitted through the center of the gelataneous<br/>conduit. Grounding Energy enters your feet and comes up<br/>through your body, activating each of your chakras. You<br/>feel each of them in turn as they resonate and align with<br/>each crest of the wave of energy that continually flows<br/>through you. As a burst breaks through your third eye and<br/>then triggers the crown chakra, you have the sensation of<br/>the white globe above your head bursting open like a white<br/>peony in spring. The energy wave, the impaling shaft of<br/>light, travels on up past infinity and into the eye of<br/>God.</p><p>An intoxicating aroma swirls within your nasal cavity,<br/>shimmering and resonating within your senses. You become<br/>aware that your vocal chords are vibrating -- you are<br/>groaning in unison with the voices you hear. They chant a<br/>prayer of unity with the cosmos. All is one, we are all<br/>interconnected. You have become attuned and in resonance<br/>with that truth.</p><p>Welcome to &quot;Ten Thousand Things&quot;.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>Now it is night time but it is bright because a full moon<br/>has appeared on the horizon, slowly ascending. You are<br/>on top of a clearing on a hill in the mountains. The<br/>clearing is surrounded by woods. You are lying down,<br/>facing up at the sky. There is bright light flickering<br/>nearby but you feel no warmth, but no cold either. There<br/>is no discomfort, no fear, all concerns are gone. You are<br/>in a deep state of peace and awareness. Without turning<br/>your head, you know that a wolf to the east observes you<br/>silently from just within the woods.</p><p>Now you remember why you are here. Your body is burning<br/>away on top of a funeral pyre. Flesh is being reduced<br/>to ashes. You observe the process intimately. It feels<br/>right.</p><p>Slowly, the moon traverses the sky as the fire burns on<br/>throughout the night. It is silent except for the<br/>crackling and occasional boom coming from the incinerating<br/>wood.</p><p>Morning comes and then a brief afternoon squall finishes<br/>off the embers. A few skull fragments are left but not<br/>much else. Ashes wash away into the ground from the rain.</p><p>As the seasons pass, you feel each atom of your body<br/>as it is redistributed througout the earth. Parts of<br/>your minerals feed grass and wildflowers and you feel in<br/>resonance with each blade. Deer eat the grass and you move<br/>on and travel with each of them, seeing and experiencing<br/>what each of them sees and experiences. Slugs and<br/>grasshoppers each your blades of grass. Other men eat the<br/>deer and tnhen one day, they burn too. Some particles of<br/>you soak into the water table and move hundreds of miles<br/>underground then up through a spring into a creek then<br/>down the creek into a river then out the river into the<br/>ocean. Your body in now thousands of miles across and you<br/>are completely aware of each molecule and of each atom<br/>within each molecule. Some molecules chemically react<br/>with others in their new environment and became new<br/>substances. You are aware of each one. A thousand years<br/>pass. Then two thousand. During this time, you see and<br/>are part of all and are completely aware.</p><p>One day each molecule will be reassembled from diverse<br/>places into a resurrected body and you will move again.</p><p>You will then be told of Galunlati -- the Celestial Upper<br/>Realm. The Land of the Great Elders, where the animals and<br/>plants lived before the Creation of Man.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p>&quot;Galunlati: Ancient Sounds in A Modern World&quot;<br/>by Jacky Ligon                  released 2001</p><p>1.

Jacky Ligon, a<br/>Native American from North Carolina, is one such artist<br/>who has tapped into the wavefront of the energy of his<br/>ancestral spirits, riding that crest as it builds up<br/>approaching the shore of the 21st century, ready to become<br/>a tsunami or wildfire that levels the old cities, erasing<br/>their constrictions and gifting us with an opportunity to<br/>rebuild.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>Review by X.

Some having well over 100 tracks.
