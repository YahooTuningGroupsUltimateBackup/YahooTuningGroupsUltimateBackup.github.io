If so, how long did you wait<br/>&gt;before you received the book?</p><p>&gt;I mailed my check to them almost three months ago.  I&apos;m beginning to think<br/>&gt;I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t order more than just this book and another one.  I&apos;d be<br/>&gt;pretty unhappy if I ordered, say, $100 worth of CDs or something from them.</p><p>Yeah, I sent a check to them several years ago for a tape and have yet to<br/>receive it.</p></div>
