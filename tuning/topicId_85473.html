The album&apos;s called Golden Hour, and it&apos;s a real feast of drum&apos;n&apos;bass, with some IDM, dubstep, and general electronic music thrown in the mix. It&apos;s available at <a href="http://www.split-notes.com/spnt001.php">http://www.split-notes.com/spnt001.php</a> in mp3, ogg or flac format.</p><p>This album is my debut in microtonal land, as my three previous releases were all 12-tet. It&apos;s as much aimed for microtone lovers as it is for non-microtonalists, so expect some xenharmonic tracks and then some familiar-sounding (yet definitely microtonal) works. If you&apos;re a user of the social networking site Xenharmonic Alliance Ning then you may have heard one or two tracks already.</p><p>You might notice the website I linked to above - &quot;Split Notes&quot; - this is a netlabel I have recently set up to promote microtonal music in popular styles, ready for consumption by the masses, to introduce them to microtones if you will. Generally the idea is &quot;microtonal with a beat&quot;. Golden Hour is the first release, and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll release many more works here in the future. Also, Split Notes is open to all composers who are looking for a home to release their work in any genre. I can distribute music on the site and around the web, and help promote it to bring in a few listeners.</p><p>I hope you&apos;ll enjoy the album, it&apos;s certainly worth having a mini rave in your living room while you listen to it! ;-) And if you&apos;re interested in Split Notes then I thank you very kindly, because making it an online hub for great microtonal music will be my pet project for a long while to come.</p><p>All the best!</p><p>Sean</p></div><h3><a id=85474 href="#85474">ðŸ”—</a>caleb morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2010 4:58:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Listening, right now, to insane Javanese whirligigs going bananas.</p><p>More listening through today....</p><p>now bit-crunched aliasing oh-wo-wo&apos;s.</p><p>I like this stuff.

Just scale: 1/1 17/16 7/6 4/3 3/2 14/9 7/4 2/1<br/>6. 15-tet, mostly in the equal pentatonic scale, but 15-tet was used for one diatonic passage and for occasional melodic inflections.<br/>7. Bohlen-pierce (equally tempered).<br/>8. I used a tuning preset on my synth called &quot;JI-11&quot;, I&apos;m not sure what each interval is but it was a diatonic sounding scale.<br/>9. Bohlen-pierce (equally tempered).<br/>10. Non-octave empirical scale: 0c 86.265c 217.449c 410.520c 589.714c 683.627c (683.627 here acts as a pseudo-octave)<br/>11. Same non-octave scale as above.<br/>12. 22-tet.<br/>13. Wendy Carlos&apos; Beta.<br/>14. Just scale: 1/1 2401/2304 7/6 343/288 343/256 49/36 2401/1728 49/32 2401/1536 343/216 7/4 343/192 2/1<br/>15.

With full disclosure at the artist<br/>home blog / site for those who dig.</p><p>Too many people go - microtonal - that&apos;s sh!t and don&apos;t listen fully.<br/>When I go stealth (at certain venues) the result:<br/>Sometimes I get comments like - its out of tune - or if you tune your piano<br/>better.<br/>But it is really nice when you hear - different but I can&apos;t put my finger on<br/>why,...</p><p>Also, so far, my experience has been the more exotic the timbre the higher<br/>probability of the tuning being unnoticed as being different. My ambient<br/>piece with Michael&apos;s phiter tuning has received several hundred downloads on<br/>non-micro sites MP3 aggregation sites. (I can see the link backs in my<br/>stats) No one notices that it is micro - they just think it sounds<br/>especially dark.</p><p>Frankly - we need more of this stealth - when micro becomes common place<br/>without people really realizing it I think it may pay to advertise outside<br/>of our community.

I did this as a compromise between 1) having a straight 7-note harmonic series and the best possibility so far as periodicity theory and 2) having something that merges on 7-TET as that&apos;s idea so far as consonance theory concerning keeping root tones a maximum distance apart.</p><p>   The highest denominator ratio in this scale is 12/11 and that occurs between 11/8 and 3/2...and between 11/6 and 2/1.<br/>  In my book at least, 12/11 is pretty darn low for a 7-tone scale since about 11/10 is the absolute smallest possible maximum interval in a 7-note scale (as 7-TET has a 53/48 or 1.104 ratio between each of its notes).</p></div><h3><a id=85494 href="#85494">ðŸ”—</a>sevishmusic &#x3C;sevish@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2010 6:49:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you Jay!
