But I&apos;m pleased that Pete doesn&apos;t<br/>try to make a little tin god out of you, too.  For God&apos;s sake,<br/>Erv Wilson, however wonderful a person he may be (and probably<br/>is, from the little I&apos;ve read) is still a human being.  It&apos;s too easy<br/>to carry humility and reverence so far that it incapacitates us<br/>from _doing_ anything ourselves.</p><p>Still, most of us need heroes, don&apos;t we?  It&apos;s just that some of<br/>us know ourselves so well, that we are simply astounded every<br/>day by our own brilliance, and thus can serve as our own r&iuml;&iquest;&half;le<br/>models!  (Speaking strictly for myself, of course :-) ...)</p><p>I won&apos;t begin to enumerate my many dazzling qualities here,<br/>my scholarly, musical, artistic, mathematical and pedagogical<br/>feats, or even those personal attributes that charm vipers,<br/>for fear of being castigated for a lack of seemly humility.<br/>Besides which, it might blind some lesser lights, so much so<br/>that they begin to waste my time and theirs in making<br/>unnecessary pilgrimages to grovel at my feet in silent awe;<br/>when instead they could be taking their _own_ lights out from<br/>under the bushel.</p><p>In case you hadn&apos;t guessed by now, my theme song is:<br/>&quot;Oh Lord!  It&apos;s hard to be humble.&quot;</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>-----Original Messages (19, 21, 22 of the digest)-----<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Message: 19<br/>   Date: Wed, 9 Mar 2005 11:05:27 +0200<br/>   From: &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot;<br/>Subject: Re: Re: Erv Wilson</p><p>I can read Arabic and can you a lot of things about quasars and supernovas,<br/>but I don&apos;t see anyone astonished at my e-presence... ;)<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Gene Ward Smith<br/>  To: tuning<br/>  Sent: 09 Mart 2005 &iuml;&iquest;&half;ar&iuml;&iquest;&half;amba 0:21<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Erv Wilson</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pete McRae &lt;ambassadorbob@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>  &gt; It&apos;s quite engaging, really.

Nevertheless I take pride in my<br/>oratorial skills in other languages (transliterated in latin).</p><p>There are several treatises in Arabic awaiting translation at the moment<br/>though. This calls for a scholarly teamwork. I stand ready to do an analysis<br/>on any treatise once its fully and correctly prepared in either English or<br/>Turkish.</p><p>BTW, I&apos;m an astronomy fan and have here a huge atlas of astronomy relased by<br/>the Cambridge University that I can refer to. In regards to music, I was<br/>very intrigued by the solor scale.
