Rather that abruptly shifting by a comma at<br/>a particular point in the score, in order to cancel the comma &quot;pump&quot;, most<br/>of us seem to agree that a fine ensemble will &quot;hide&quot; the comma through<br/>gradual compromises and thereby avoid drift. Your approach assumes that all<br/>melodic, as well as harmonic, intervals are simple-integer ratios; while<br/>most harmonies are indeed amenable to this approach, melodies are involved<br/>in motivic considerations and achieving a rough degree of intervallic<br/>consistency between motivic statements can be a stronger consideration than<br/>fixing all minor triads to 16:19:24, all dominant sevenths to 4:5:6:7<br/>(personally I would only use 4:5:6:7 for a &quot;tonic&quot; (eg Mixolydian) seventh),<br/>or even all major triads to 4:5:6. Both of these issues, especially the<br/>former, speak against a strict JI approach like the one you&apos;re taking,<br/>certainly for composers such as Mozart. By the way, what do you think<br/>happens when major and minor triads link together, as in a minor seventh<br/>chord or major seventh chord?</p></div>
