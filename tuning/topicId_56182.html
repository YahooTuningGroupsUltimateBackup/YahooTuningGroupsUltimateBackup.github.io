What are the details of this piece?  Do I<br/>&gt; know the tune from somewhere?  Who&apos;s singing?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>I wrote the melody and some of the words about thirty years.<br/>The melody will sound familiar, as it is written over the ubiquitous fifties chord sequence C Am Dm7 G7 (I, VIm, IIm, V7) in the key of A, and the rest of the chord sequences are very conventional country-rock, except for a key change about three minutes into the piece. It was originally composed in 12tET on guiitar. About six months ago I started playing with it again, with the idea of making an ironic statement about the current state of the US government and society generally.<br/>I used Logic 6 and EXS24 having microtuned every note for every sample which I used, so that I had many zones for each sound. Very tedious;-)</p><p>I got a local medical student to put a vocal on it for me, and put a link to it on the tuning list.<br/>I got criticism about the synth horns sound, the out of tune vocals, and the general levels in the mix.<br/>Having just started using Logic 7, which has microtuning capability, I was now able to use any instruments including synths.</p><p>Hence the new version with vocals by my mad Welsh friend Mike James, who also put on the trumpet parts.<br/>A little auto tune on the vocals and acoustic instruments matched up the pitch inconsistencies.</p><br/>
