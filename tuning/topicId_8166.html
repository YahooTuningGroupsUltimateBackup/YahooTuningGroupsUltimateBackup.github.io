However, this effect is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; normally demonstrated with sine waves, and I doubt it would continue to be<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; important with normal harmonic timbres. Terhardt, though, believes that our<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; inner mental template of the harmonic series is considerably &quot;stretched&quot; due<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; to this phenomenon.</p><p>I responded:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;This is extremely interesting, Paul. It seems very possible to me that I<br/>&gt; was<br/>&gt;&gt;experiencing that phenomenon in this case. I&apos;m not sure that it fully<br/>&gt;&gt;explains why the high third appears to &quot;lock,&quot; however, particularly since<br/>&gt;&gt;you note that it appears to happen mainly with sine waves. On the other<br/>&gt;&gt;hand, why do you &quot;doubt it would continue to be important with normal<br/>&gt;&gt;harmonic timbres&quot;? Has this effect been studied with &quot;normal&quot; timbres and<br/>&gt;&gt;been shown not to happen?</p><p>Paul continued:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reason I doubt it is because the overtones would normally provide the<br/>&gt; brain with a great deal of information to use in what is known as<br/>&gt; periodicity hearing -- the neural impulses &quot;lock in phase&quot; with the note,<br/>&gt; thereby providing the brain with a very precise reading as to its frequency.<br/>&gt; But the effect might not be eliminated entirely. Here are some papers for<br/>&gt; you to study (perhaps someone near a library who speaks German can summarize<br/>&gt; them for us):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wallister, K. (1969), &quot;&#xFFFD;ber die Abh&#xFFFD;ngigkeiten der Tonh&#xFFFD;henempfindung von<br/>&gt; Sinust&#xFFFD;nen vom Schallpegel, von &#xFFFD;berlagertem drosselndem St&#xFFFD;rschall und von<br/>&gt; der Darbietungsdauer,&quot; Acustica 21, 211-221.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Terhardt, E., and Fastl, H. (1971). &quot;Zum Einfluss von St&#xFFFD;rt&#xFFFD;nen und<br/>&gt; St&#xFFFD;ger&#xFFFD;uchen auf die Tonh&#xFFFD;he von Sinust&#xFFFD;nen,&quot; Acustica 25, 53-61.</p><p>I&apos;m curious to know what can be learned from these sources. Am I correct<br/>that some of our List members are German? I hesitate to impose, but it would<br/>be very helpful here. My German consists of &quot;Was ist?&quot; and that&apos;s about it.</p><p>I said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;In any case, this opens a whole other world of possibilities.</p><p>To which Paul said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keep your mind open. It seems you&apos;ve already decided what the &quot;right&quot; answer<br/>&gt; is, and chosen to take a very inconsistent view of the evidence in order to<br/>&gt; support your belief. That&apos;s a dangerous kind of thinking, precisely the kind<br/>&gt; I get the impression you&apos;ve tried to warn us against in your book, and yet<br/>&gt; you&apos;re falling into it yourself.</p><p>On the contrary, I think my posts in this &quot;batch&quot; give evidence that I have<br/>not closed the &quot;case.&quot; All I have said is that the 7:9 solution seems to be<br/>at the top of the list of possible explanations. I realize that you are<br/>admonishing me to reconsider that position--and I am willing to do so<br/>provided sufficient evidence is forthcoming to warrant that caution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, if you don&apos;t believe (a select subset of) Monz&apos;s MIDI files, why<br/>&gt; don&apos;t you walk over to your M-1 and tune up those chords yourself?</p><p>I think I have described the problem in that regard.</p><p>Thanks for the German references. I hope someone will be able to pick up on<br/>them. It would seem that all who have been following this thread would be<br/>enriched.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
