Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2000 7:21:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and thanks to Paul Erlich and David Finnamore for their<br/>responses to my suggestion for a possible Science Fair project<br/>comparing the approach of different musical styels and tunings to the<br/>syntonic comma.</p><p>As both Paul and David pointed out, many musical styles such as those<br/>of Gothic Europe during the 13th and 14th centuries might be quite<br/>unfamiliar to many participants at a Science Fair, making it difficult<br/>for these participants to form any ready opinion on a preferred<br/>tuning.</p><p>More generally, any _alternate_ tuning or musical style must face a<br/>this kind of barrier to one degree or another: people need to hear it<br/>and get acquainted with it in order to have an opportunity to<br/>appreciate its aesthetics and beauty. In order to get acquainted with<br/>it, however, they have to encounter it.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that while it&apos;s not so surprising that I would<br/>propose Gothic European music as an example of a music where the<br/>syntonic comma is _not_ a &quot;universal problem,&quot; various world musics<br/>using or approximating Pythagorean tunings could equally well have<br/>been selected.</p><p>In fact, I regard the view sometimes expressed here that &quot;Gothic music<br/>is very hard to comprehend&quot; as a positive opportunity, since it places<br/>me in a position somewhat comparable to those of musicians following<br/>many other world traditions. How misguided I would be to miss the<br/>benefits of such a situation by seeking a privileged position for<br/>Gothic music simply because it happens to be composed European music!</p><p>If one takes the view that a Science Fair project can and should be an<br/>opportunity for people to discover &quot;unfamiliar&quot; musics around the<br/>world, then the remarks of Paul and David suggest the wisdom of<br/>creating a welcoming and exploratory atmosphere for participants.</p><p>The message would be that it&apos;s not &quot;wrong&quot; if something sounds &quot;weird&quot;<br/>or totally unfamiliar. If there are surveys as to which tuning a<br/>participant suspects might be associated with which piece, or which<br/>tuning the participant prefers, including choices such as &quot;I don&apos;t<br/>know,&quot; or &quot;The music is too unfamiliar for me to judge&quot; might be a<br/>wise policy.</p><p>Having said this, I might add that while inaccurate statements of<br/>facts about music can often be easily corrected, style-specific<br/>judgments about intervals and tunings (often implicit) are often more<br/>difficult to have recognized as indeed style-specific.</p><p>For example, it is easy to show that 53 pure 3:2 fifths very closely<br/>approximate 31 pure octaves, and that by tempering the last fifth in<br/>the cycle to obtain a pure 2:1 octave, we can obtain a &quot;virtually<br/>closed&quot; system. (The last fifth is narrowed by ~3.62 cents.) In<br/>contrast, 72 pure fifths will be much further from any pure octave.<br/>While Chinese musicians seem to have recognized the close affinity of<br/>the first and 54th notes in such a cycle, we can confirm these<br/>conclusions using logarithms simply by taking the size of a pure<br/>fifth, ~701.955 cents, multiplying the requisite number of times, and<br/>seeing how closely the result approximates an integer multiple of 1200<br/>cents (a pure 2:1 octave).</p><p>Demonstrating that the syntonic comma is a &quot;problem&quot; in some musics --<br/>but not all -- may be a more difficult process, because ideally it<br/>involves exposure to musics illustrating how this comma may or may not<br/>be a problem.</p><p>The more I consider this process, the more I am inclined to conclude<br/>that a Science Fair project exploring this issue should _not_ include<br/>Gothic European music as the _one_ example of a 3-limit music where<br/>the syntonic comma is not a problem. Chinese or Japanese music based<br/>on a tuning in pure fifths, for example, would give listeners a wider<br/>cultural view and also show, when compared to Gothic music, that not<br/>all 3-limit or Pythagorean musics are alike.</p><p>Further, it seems to me that Gothic music offer suffers from a quite<br/>&quot;non-splended isolation&quot; -- people compare it _only_ to later styles<br/>of European music, in isolation from other world musics which either<br/>use Pythagorean tunings or prefer fifths and fourths as the main<br/>vertical intervals in polyphony. This leads to the idea that Gothic<br/>music is somehow &quot;unnatural&quot; or a mere intellectual abstraction, as<br/>opposed to one of many great world musics.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
