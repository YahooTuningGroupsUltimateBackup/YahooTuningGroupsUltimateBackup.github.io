It was certainly a wonderful time, though I&apos;m happy to get some<br/>sleep now.</p><p>There was an interesting review of the conference (and, by extension, the<br/>tuning community) that appeared in the Los Angeles Times yesterday written<br/>by Mark Swed, who attended the conference most of the weekend. You can read<br/>it here:</p><p><a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/top/1,1419,L-LATimes-Music-0!ArticleDetail-28829,00">http://www.calendarlive.com/top/1,1419,L-LATimes-Music-0!ArticleDetail-28829,00</a>.<br/>html</p><p>Second, I have updated the MicroFest web pages to include the URLs of the<br/>conference participants who gave it to me. Several people asked that I post<br/>them. So now you can find them as links to the participants&apos; names on this<br/>page:</p><p><a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/microfestbios.html">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/microfestbios.html</a></p><p>I have been asked by the library here at the Claremont Colleges if I could<br/>deposit with them some copies of conference materials for their archives.<br/>Unfortunately, because I was running around most of the time rather than<br/>attending the papers, I don&apos;t have many of the handouts. If you would like<br/>your handouts or papers included in this archive, please send what you have<br/>to me at the address below.</p><p>On another topic, I have been informed that the Claremont Colleges is<br/>considering alternatives to the Claremont Inn for future events of this<br/>sort and would appreciate hearing all about your Claremont Inn horror<br/>stories (or good experiences, of course, though I have a feeling there were<br/>fewer of those). I apologize again for any inconveniences or worse.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry to report that Paul Erlich&apos;s paper arrived to late to be made<br/>available at the conference, but I hope to soon relay information about how<br/>you can obtain it.</p><p>Thanks again to all!</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

Perhaps everyone disturbed by this<br/>could write directly, or mention it to them.  I&apos;m sure they would be<br/>equally unhappy with their &quot;guests...&quot;</p><p>The upside was the proximity to the colleges.  The easy walking<br/>distance made independence possible... so I, personally, would<br/>advocate reuse of the facility, with the caveat that the management<br/>should DEFINITELY do and know something about the rowdiness, beer<br/>bottles in the hall...etc., etc.</p><p>It made microtonal scufflers seem practically SEDATE...</p><p>________ _____ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
