I think we live in the (commercial) 12tet world.</p><p>I openly profess a lack of knowledge of the viability of non-Western markets, i.e. how big a market is there for alternate tunings in any number of Middle Eastern cultures? I know that there are some instruments made just for that market, but I don&apos;t know much about it and especially how big a piece of the pie it is.</p><p>But, outside of occasional use of microtones for &apos;cool sounds&apos; or something, I really don&apos;t think most people would take the time to really work in microtones.

You mean the dinky microtonal community?? I think these people will make inroads with softsynth people - I&apos;ve watched it happen on MMM - because it is *so* much more cost-effective to debug and implement (and change!) a software feature over a corresponding hardware feature. But hard manufacturers will NOT commit resources if they are not going to get a return on their investment.</p><p>&gt; Not that I agree with that bit about market forces. I&apos;m more<br/>&gt; from the, &apos;if you build it they will come&apos; school of thought.</p><p>How many people have bought Starrboards? Or Marimba Luminas? or any number of elegant and creative solutions to finding new ways to make music, only to find they can&apos;t make them cheap enough, or so very few people are truly interested in something _new_ as opposed to something that is just _flavor_of_the_month_.</p><p>I had a day to kill today in (of all places), Hollywood, CA. I spent the morning going to a half-dozen music stores to gather information about a project. This is one of the big homes of the recording industry. This is toy-land.</p><p>And there aren&apos;t microtonal keyboards on display, and there probably won&apos;t be. Unless - and it has been said around here, for a long time by a very few people - there is a compelling musical need for it.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
