The &quot;fine structure&quot; of 24-note meantone<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>An intriguing quality of 24-note meantone with pure major thirds is<br/>its subtly unequal division of the tone, featuring two slightly<br/>different sizes of fifthtones. This nuance raises some fine points of<br/>tuning and of note spelling, and makes available two slightly<br/>different versions of certain enharmonically inflected intervals such<br/>as Vicentino&apos;s proximate minor third near 11:9 (e.g. C-Eb*, D*-F#).</p><p>As in a usual 12-note tuning, so in extended 24-note or 31-note<br/>tunings, the division of a pure major third at 5:4 (~386.31 cents)<br/>into a chain of four equal fifths of ~696.58 cents -- each tempered or<br/>made narrower than a pure 3:2 by 1/4 syntonic comma or ~5.38 cents --<br/>determines the rest of the structure.</p><p>Each regular whole-tone is a &quot;meantone&quot; equal to precisely half of a<br/>pure major third (~193.157 cents), or to the &quot;mean&quot; or average of the<br/>unequal whole-tones of 9:8 and 10:9 together forming a pure major<br/>third in 16th-century systems of just intonation. This tone is divided<br/>into a large diatonic semitone (e.g. E-F, C#-D, Bb-A) of ~117.11 cents<br/>and a small chromatic semitone (e.g. C-C#, Bb-B) of ~76.05 cents. This<br/>contrast between the two semitones lends a distinctive flavor to<br/>chromatic progressions on a 12-note or extended meantone keyboard.</p><p>At a finer or enharmonic level of structure, the difference between<br/>these semitones defines the diesis of 128:125 or ~41.06 cents, the<br/>distance for example between G# and Ab, and also between any note on<br/>our lower manual and its counterpart on the upper manual (e.g. D-D*,<br/>Eb-Eb*), see Section 1, and the following keyboard diagram:</p><p>                                           8:5<br/>     117.11     351.32         620.53    813.69      1047.90<br/>     Db/C#*       Eb*          Gb/F#*    Ab/G#*        Bb*<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  C*        D*        E*     F*        G*        A*        B*     C*<br/> 41.06    234.22   427.37  544.48    737.64    930.79  1123.95  1200.00<br/>                    32:25<br/>                             Manual 2<br/>                       --------------------<br/>                             Manual 1<br/>                                        25:16<br/>   76.05      310.26         579.47    772.63     1006.84<br/>    C#          Eb             F#        G#          Bb<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>C         D         E      F         G         A         B      C<br/>0       193.16   386.31  503.42    696.58     889.74  1082.89  1200.00<br/>                   5:4</p><p>Looking at the fine structure more closely, we find that in addition<br/>to this diesis or &quot;fifthtone&quot; there is a second flavor of fifthtone, a<br/>slightly smaller interval (e.g. C*-C#) equal to about 34.99 cents, or<br/>the difference between a chromatic semitone and our diesis. Our<br/>24-note tuning divides each whole-tone into two &quot;larger fifthtones&quot;<br/>(LF), a &quot;smaller fifthtone&quot; (SF), and a chromatic semitone (CS):</p><p>     LF          SF          LF                CS<br/>|------------|----------|------------|---------------------|<br/>C           C*         C#           Db                     D<br/>                                               (Db*)<br/>|------------|----------|------------|-----------|---------|<br/>0         ~41.06     ~76.05      ~117.11     ~158.17   ~193.16<br/>   ~41.06       ~34.99     ~41.06       ~41.06     ~34.99<br/>|------------|----------|------------|-----------|---------|<br/>                      (D#)<br/>D           D*                      Eb          Eb*        E<br/>|------------|-----------------------|-----------|---------|<br/>     LF                 CS                LF         SF</p><p>This chart shows two types of patterns: one for diatonic whole-tones<br/>divided in a 12-note tuning of Eb-G# by a sharp (e.g. C-C#-D), the<br/>other for those divided by a flat (e.g. D-Eb-E). Our 24-tone tuning<br/>more generally splits _any_ regular whole-tone (e.g. D*-E*, Gb-Ab)<br/>into some pattern of the four adjacent intervals CS-LF-SF-LF, although<br/>the order may fit into any of four &quot;whole-tone species.&quot;[18]</p><p>A full 31-note tuning such as Vicentino&apos;s or Colonna&apos;s (Section 2), if<br/>realized in 1/4-comma meantone, would divide each tone into five<br/>adjacent intervals: some pattern of three large and two small<br/>fifthtones (e.g. LF-SF-LF-LF-SF). The central portion of the diagram<br/>shows this fivefold division, naming in parentheses the extra notes<br/>which would split an undivided chromatic semitone into two unequal<br/>fifthtones (LF + SF = CS).</p><p>Our fourfold division of the tone happily supports some of the same<br/>striking effects as a full fivefold division. Consider Colonna&apos;s<br/>remarkable example of a cadence with &quot;fourth and minor sixth&quot;<br/>progressing by a _strisciata di voce_ or &quot;sliding&quot; in fifthtones to a<br/>major sixth an extra diesis wide before resolving to the octave[19]:</p><p>                   (|)<br/>C5   C*5 | C#5  Db5   D5<br/>G4   G4    G4   G4    A4<br/>E4   E4    E4   E4    F#4<br/>E3   E3    E3   E3    D3</p><p>Colonna&apos;s even minims or half-notes and his one barline &quot;|&quot; suggest a<br/>reading in a fluent 2/2; I have added a barline &quot;(|)&quot; before the<br/>prolonged final sonority, a breve.</p><p>A three-voice version in which the right hand takes the highest part<br/>only, moving freely between manuals, may be much more practical on<br/>some keyboards (including mine). Intervals formed by the upper part<br/>with the other two are shown both as rounded cents and as approximate<br/>integer ratios, possibly of special interest since Colonna admits<br/>interval ratios such as 7:6, 11:8, and 17:12 on his monochord[20]:</p><p>814( 8:5)  855(~18:11)  890(~5:3)  931(~12:7)    1200(2:1)<br/>503(~4:3)  544(~11:8)   579(~7:5)  620(~10:7)     814(8:5)<br/>        +41         +35         +41          +76<br/>   C5        C*5     |    C#5         Db5    (|)   D5<br/>   G4        G4           G4          G4           F#4<br/>   E4        E4           E4          E4           D4</p><p>The signed numbers above the notes show the melodic steps of the upper<br/>voice as measured in our 24-note tuning. Starting at a usual minor<br/>sixth and fourth above the lower voices, it ascends 41 cents to form<br/>what Vicentino calls a &quot;proximate minor sixth&quot; (between minor and<br/>major) and a more-than-fourth (about 7 cents narrower than 11:8).<br/>The next 35-cent fifthtone brings us to a usual major sixth and<br/>augmented fourth, inviting a Renaissance-style resolution by contrary<br/>motion to octave and sixth respectively (e.g. E4-G4-C#5 to D4-F#4-D5).</p><p>First, however, the major sixth is enlarged by another 41-cent<br/>fifthtone to a diminished seventh, Vicentino&apos;s &quot;proximate major<br/>sixth,&quot; and the augmented fourth to a diminished fifth. Without<br/>affecting the routine progression of the lower voices, this increases<br/>the cadential tension and narrows the final resolving motion of the<br/>upper voice from a usual diatonic semitone (C#5-D5) to a 76-cent<br/>chromatic semitone (Db5-D5).</p><p>This cadence, which may reflect the vertical liberties of around 1600<br/>rather than the more measured style of Vicentino or Bertrand[21], is<br/>available in our standard 24-note tuning of Eb-G#/Eb*-Ab to five of<br/>the seven diatonic notes: D (as above), F, G, A, and C. These are the<br/>cadential centers where, in usual 16th-century practice, a major sixth<br/>expands to the octave with ascending semitonal motion. In each case,<br/>subtracting the bracketed notes of Colonna&apos;s formula, we are left with<br/>such a routine cadence, the outer voices expanding M6-8 while the<br/>upper voices resolve an augmented fourth to a sixth:</p><p>   LF   SF  LF   CS          LF   SF  LF   CS        LF  SF   LF   CS<br/>[C4 C*4] C#4 [Db4] D4    [Eb4 Eb*4] E4 [E*4] F4   [F4 F*4] F#4 [Gb4] G4<br/> G3                F#3    Bb3                A3    C4                B3<br/> E3                D3     G3                 F3    A3                G3</p><p>   LF   SF  LF   CS          LF   SF  LF   CS<br/>[G4 G*4] G#4 [Ab4] A4    [Bb4 Bb*4] B4 [B*4] C5<br/> D4                C#4    F4                 E4<br/> B3                A3     D4                 C4</p><p>Here, as in the usual 16th-century modal system, the E center is<br/>special, calling for the _descending_ semitonal approach (F-E) so<br/>characteristic of Phrygian. If we &quot;adapt&quot; Colonna&apos;s formula to this<br/>mode by placing a _downward_ melodic sequence of LF-SF-LF in the<br/>_lowest_ voice, we get a different set of vertical intervals and<br/>conclude with a normal 117-cent diatonic semitone (DS) rather than a<br/>chromatic one as above. This cadence might also be transposed to the<br/>less common cadential center of B, the middle voice ending on the<br/>fifth F# or the minor third D[22]:</p><p> D5                  E5       A4                  B4<br/> A4                  G#4      E4                  D4/F#4<br/>[Gb4  F#4  F*4]  F4  E4      [Db4  C#4  C*4]  C4  B4<br/>    LF   SF    LF  DS            LF   SF    LF  DS<br/>   -41  -35   -41 -117          -41  -35   -41 -117</p><p>A subtler kind of asymmetry involves slight variations in the size of<br/>intervals such as Vicentino&apos;s &quot;proximate minor thirds&quot; because of the<br/>two sizes of fifthtones:</p><p>|-------------------------- 351.32 -----------------------| 34.99 |<br/>                                                         Eb*<br/>C--------|------------------------------------------------|-------E<br/>0        C*                                                    386.31<br/>| 41.06  |---------------------- 345.25 --------------------------|</p><p>The interval C-Eb* is equal to the pure major third C-E minus the<br/>small fifthtone Eb*-E, a size of about (386.31 - 34.99) or 351.32<br/>cents. With C*-E, however, we have C-E minus the large fifthtone C-C*,<br/>about (386.31 - 41.06) or 345.25 cents. Alternatively, we could show<br/>that C-Eb* is equal to the meantone minor third C-Eb (~310.26 cents)<br/>plus the large fifthtone Eb-Eb*, and C*-E to the minor third C#-E plus<br/>the small fifthtone C*-C#.</p><p>These slightly unequal flavors of proximate minor thirds compare with<br/>Vicentino&apos;s integer approximation of 11:9 (~347.41 cents), and the<br/>single size of 9/31 octave (~348.39 cents) occurring in 31-tet.[23]</p><p>While the size of our two flavors of fifthtones results from the<br/>general properties of 1/4-comma meantone, the specific placement of<br/>these large and small fifthtones is a matter of choice. This choice is<br/>determined by whether we tune an enharmonic note such as C* or Eb* on<br/>the flat or the sharp side of the chain of fifths.</p><p>As it happens, our tuning treats all enharmonic notes as flats; but in<br/>Vicentino&apos;s (Section 2), following his suggested tuning order, almost<br/>all are treated as sharps. Thus if we realized his tuning as 1/4-comma<br/>meantone, C-C* would be a small fifthtone and Eb*-E a large fifthtone,<br/>the converse of what we have just seen above.</p><p>A helpful rule is that each flat lowers a note by a chromatic<br/>semitone, about 76.05 cents in a 1/4-comma tuning, while each sharp<br/>raises it by the same amount. Thus double flats or sharps lower or<br/>raise a note by ~152.1 cents, and the triple flats or sharps found in<br/>some 31-note tunings (e.g. Vicentino, G*=F###) by ~228.3 cents.</p><p>Thus C*, when tuned on the flat side of the chain of fifths as Dbb, is<br/>located at a distance of two chromatic semitones below D (Dbb-Db-D),<br/>or about 152.10 cents. In 1/4-comma meantone, a regular whole-tone such<br/>as C-D is about 193.16 cents, so the fifthtone C-C* (C-Dbb) is equal to<br/>roughly (193.16 - 152.10) or 41.06 cents, our larger fifthtone:</p><p>                 C*  G*  D*  A*  E* B*<br/>Tuning chain: ...Dbb-Abb-Ebb-Bbb-Fb-Cb-Gb-Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F...</p><p>|---41---|------------- 152 ------------|<br/>|        |------ 76 -----|----- 76 -----|<br/>|        |---------------|--------------|<br/>C     Dbb=C*            Db              D<br/>|--------|---------------|--------------|<br/>0       41              117            193</p><p>When tuned on the sharp side of the chain as B##, however, C* is<br/>located at a distance of two chromatic semitones above B (B-B#-B##),<br/>again ~152.10 cents. In 1/4-comma tuning, a diatonic semitone such as<br/>B-C is equal to about 117.11 cents, so C-C* is equal to roughly<br/>(152.10 - 117.11) or 34.99 cents, our smaller fifthtone.</p><p>                                  Gb* Db* Ab* Eb* Bb* F*  C*<br/>Tuning chain: ...B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-F##-C##-G##-D##-A##-E##-B##...</p><p>|----- 76 -----|----- 76 -----|<br/>|--------------|--------------|<br/>B             B#       C   B##=C*<br/>|--------------|-------|------|<br/>0             76      117    152<br/>                       |--35--|</p><p>For these asymmetries in the placement of large and small fifthtones<br/>depending on whether C* is tuned as Dbb or B##, for example, I am<br/>tempted to use the term _chirality_ or &quot;handedness.&quot;[24] The metaphor<br/>of a &quot;mirrorlike asymmetry&quot; like that between a pair of hands or<br/>gloves may become clearer if we compare the fivefold division of a<br/>whole-tone such as C-D in full 31-note tunings of contrasting<br/>chirality. Note that the ascending sequence LF-SF-LF-LF-SF in the<br/>first tuning is identical to the _descending_ sequence in the second<br/>tuning:</p><p>|---- 41 ----|--- 35 ---|---- 41 ----|---- 41 ----|--- 35 ---|<br/>C          C*=Dbb      C#           Db         Db*=Ebbb      D<br/>|------------|----------|------------|------------|----------|<br/>      LF          SF          LF           LF          SF</p><p>|--- 35 ---|---- 41 ----|---- 41 ----|--- 35 ---|---- 41 ----|<br/>C        C*=B##        C#           Db       Db*=C##         D<br/>|----------|------------|------------|----------|------------|<br/>     SF          LF           LF          SF          LF</p><p>The choice of chirality for an archicembalo tuning may depend in part<br/>on the size of the tuning (e.g. 24 or 31 notes), in part upon the kind<br/>of music most likely to be played, and in part on sheer convention.<br/>Vicentino, for example, tunes B* as Cb, but the other 11 notes of his<br/>fourth and fifth ranks (Section 2) from Gb* up to E* as F##-D###.</p><p>For our usual 24-note tuning of Eb-G#/Eb*-Ab, tuning all 12 notes of<br/>the second manual as flats has the convenience of a single chain of<br/>fifths for the whole instrument:</p><p>Eb* Bb* F*  C*  G*  D*  A*  E* B*<br/>Fbb-Cbb-Gbb-Dbb-Abb-Ebb-Bbb-Fb-Cb-Gb-Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#<br/>                Manual 2                  |           Manual 1</p><p>In this arrangement, the &quot;*&quot; sign always raises a note by the large<br/>fifthtone of about 41 cents, the 128:125 diesis (e.g. C-C*, Eb-Eb*).<br/>Apart from its conceptual simplicity, this convention may have a<br/>musical advantage for the fifthtone compositions of Vicentino and<br/>Bertrand.</p><p>In such compositions, the three flats Gb, Db, and Ab often serve as<br/>major thirds in &quot;alternate universe&quot; sonorities with enharmonic notes<br/>such as E*3-Gb3-B*3, A*3-Db4-E*4, and D*4-Gb4-A*4, also spellable as<br/>E*3-G#*3-B*, A*3-C#*3-E*3, and D*4-F#*4-A*4 (see Section 1).</p><p>In our tuning, a spelling of the second type such as E*3-G#*3-B*3<br/>accurately suggests a sonority with vertical intervals identical to<br/>those of E3-G#3-B3, with all three notes raiesd by the same distance:<br/>the 128:125 diesis or large fifthtone found between G# and Ab(=G#*).</p><p>       |B3                      |B*3 = B + 41.06<br/>       |     310.27             |               310.27<br/>696.58 |G#3              696.58 |Ab = G# + 41.06<br/>       |     386.31             |               386.31<br/>       |E3                      |E*3 = E + 41.06</p><p>In each case we have usual meantone concords, a pure 5:4 major third<br/>plus a fifth and minor third both 1/4-comma (~5.38 cents) narrower<br/>than 3:2 and 6:5 respectively. We could also verify that E*3-Ab-B*3<br/>has the expected meantone intervals by confirming its regular spelling<br/>on our chain of fifths shown above: Fb-Ab-Cb.</p><p>Suppose, however, that E-E* and B-B* were small fifthtones:</p><p>       |B3                      |B*3 = B + 34.99<br/>       |     310.27             |               304.20<br/>696.58 |G#3              696.58 |Ab = G# + 41.06<br/>       |     386.31             |               392.38<br/>       |E3                      |E*3 = E + 34.99</p><p>Since Ab remains a large fifthtone above G#, the major third E*3-Ab<br/>becomes about (41.06 - 34.99) or 6.07 cents wider than pure, while the<br/>minor third Ab-B*3 is narrowed by this amount beyond its usual<br/>tempering, or about (5.38 + 6.07) or 11.45 cents narrower than pure.<br/>The spelling for such a sonority on the chain of fifths, D###-Ab-A###,<br/>might also suggest a regular fifth but somewhat altered thirds.</p><p>In a full 31-tone tuning in 1/4-comma, some sonorities of this kind<br/>are inevitable, and they hardly seem to constitute musical calamities<br/>even by 16th-century standards relishing pure or near-pure thirds.</p><p>With only 24 notes, however, tuning all enharmonic notes on the flat<br/>side provides pure major thirds and other regular meantone intervals<br/>in the expected places.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
