Ls sounds<br/>&quot;subminor,&quot; but then the next L makes it sound major. The whole 225<br/>cents in 16-edo being ambiguous thing is captured in a bunch of<br/>temperaments and is the characteristic sound of the 5/4: LsL trichord.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As a last note, I&apos;m not sure that what I&apos;m really trying to get at<br/>&gt; &gt; here has to do with ratios.

Well, at least part of them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think a category consists of:<br/>&gt; * A set of compatible munits.<br/>&gt; * A very rough interval size.<br/>&gt; * A vague expectation of harmonic quality. This at least includes consonance vs dissonance, but probably does not include specific VFs at all.</p><p>I agree in general with this list, but I note that this list does not<br/>imply your statement &quot;you don&apos;t need categories for munits.&quot; This is<br/>because the last thing you mentioned - &quot;a vague expectation of<br/>harmonic quality&quot; - does not necessarily have anything to do with<br/>concordance at all, but may still have to do with learned factors. A<br/>set of learned factors that comprises a harmonic quality is itself<br/>just another layer of categorization.</p><p>For example, in the categorical experiments, all of the munits stayed<br/>the same except that 5/4 became 9/7 and 6/5 became 7/6, and we already<br/>know that the harmonic qualities didn&apos;t break. Additionally, over the<br/>course of these experiments, the concordance of the major thirds<br/>varied from relatively low at 5/4 to rather high at around 350 cents,<br/>yet some aspect of the &quot;harmonic quality&quot; stayed the same. Hence, the<br/>&quot;major third&quot; category itself implies a &quot;harmonic&quot; relationship with<br/>the tonic, in addition to a melodic one, that is apparently<br/>independent of its intonation.</p><p>Additionally, for the very sharp tunings, the augmented fourth ended<br/>up being closer to 3/2 than the actual generator, yet it still sounded<br/>unstable and in need of resolution. And around 22-EDO, the augmented<br/>second became a 5/4, but that didn&apos;t change the harmonic quality. This<br/>shouldn&apos;t be too much of a surprise because the German sixth chord,<br/>intoned as a near perfect 4:5:6:7 in quarter comma meantone, is one of<br/>the least stable chords around.</p><p>Thus, the last item in your list - &quot;a vague expectation of harmonic<br/>quality&quot; - is itself a function of categorical perception. So the<br/>&quot;harmonic quality&quot; that one is expecting is still a function of many<br/>things other than the intonation, many of which are probably learned.<br/>Something deeper is at work.</p><p>What I do know is that this mysterious &quot;harmonic quality&quot; is what I&apos;m<br/>learning to reassociate with these munits, whatever it is. As a<br/>heuristic guess it may related to the same thing that caused your<br/>perception of pelog to change when you learned that there were empats<br/>everywhere.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=102074 href="#102074">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2011 9:58:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Dec 20, 2011 at 10:35 AM, Keenan Pepper &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; 6/5: LLs, LsL, sLL (appears in Negri[10])<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And don&apos;t forget 6/5 sLs, which is in godzilla[9] and is totally nuts.</p><p>This one appears in Blackwood[10] and a bunch of random MOS&apos;s in 16-EDO as well.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
