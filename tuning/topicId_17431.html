That means the compression scheme<br/>would be similar to MP3 compression. Most people feel MP3s sound just like<br/>CDs, but others (like myself) claim to detect annoying artifacts of the data<br/>compression.</p><p>&gt;    . Just how reliable are DAT&apos;s?  A list member a while back warned<br/>&gt;      that they can die suddenly.  Are they extremely reliable<br/>&gt; when first<br/>&gt;      recorded, so that digital transfer can be used to copy<br/>&gt; them to hard<br/>&gt;      drives and/or CD&apos;s?</p><p>Any magnetic medium will fail sooner or later. With DAT, there is actual<br/>contact between the read/write head and the tape, so frequent recording<br/>and/or playback on a DAT will decrease its longevity. That being said, once<br/>a DAT or Minidisc (also magnetic) is recorded, it is bound to fail sooner or<br/>later. I&apos;ve never seen a DAT fail on its first reading after being recorded,<br/>so transfering to a hard drive from DAT is certainly reliable. I doubt<br/>there&apos;s a big reliability difference between the two formats, unless<br/>Minidisc heads do not touch the disc, which I find unlikely.</p><p>&gt;    . Do mini-disk players support digital out, or only analog out?</p><p>Like DAT machines, some players will have digital out (and maybe even<br/>inputs) and some won&apos;t.</p><p>&gt;    . How long will mini-disks be supported?</p><p>Hard to say. That would depend on the success of the format, which in my<br/>mind is in question at this time. I believe Minidisc is a proprietary<br/>Sony-only technology, so it&apos;s success in a mass market sense will be limited<br/>by that, in my opinion. Frankly, as NVRAM prices drop over time, systems<br/>with similar sound quality and no moving parts, like the Diamond Rio, may<br/>very well supercede the Minidisc. Sony itself may even try to replace the<br/>Minidisc with its memory stick technology, which is also proprietary.</p><p>&gt;    . How long will DAT&apos;s be supported?</p><p>This technology is fairly well entrenched. Because it records PCM,<br/>professional and corporate studios use DAT all the time. The number of DAT<br/>machines on the market is staggering, and almost identical technology is<br/>used for data backups in the IT community. DAT is also faster in terms of<br/>data throughput than magneto-optical technologies, so far, even though it is<br/>restricted to linear access. Probably DAT will live until it is replaced by<br/>systems with no moving parts (currently expensive NVRAM), or by much faster<br/>magneto-optical systems (like some kind of super DVD-RAM that holds more<br/>data and is ten times faster). Both of those technologies are years away,<br/>I&apos;d say.</p><p>&gt;    . How much do reasonable quality recorders for each cost?<br/>&gt; How about<br/>&gt;      media?  Both are re-writeable, aren&apos;t they?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Both are rewritable. Like any technology, cost will vary so wildly with<br/>features and quality that it&apos;s hard to say. There&apos;s a FABULOUS Tascam<br/>portable stereo DAT recorder with built-in phantom power, S/PDIF, dual XLR<br/>inputs and the works for $1200. Studios may spend more than $5000 for a<br/>rack-mountable DAT player with shuttle dial and the works, and you should be<br/>able to get a decent Sony DAT player for around $500. <a href="http://www.fullcompass.com">www.fullcompass.com</a><br/>definitly will list DAT players, and probably lists Minidisc players and<br/>media for both.</p><p>Todd</p></div><h3><a id=17460 href="#17460">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2001 5:47:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Todd, for your very detailed response to my questions about<br/>DAT vs. mini-disk.

So<br/>&gt; what are these<br/>&gt; parameters for a &quot;minidisk&quot;??</p><p>Ok... a little clarification is in order:<br/>Audio CDs are always PCM at 44.1 KHz, 16 bits per sample.</p><p>A DAT is kinda like a computer hard drive, in the sense that your &quot;software&quot;<br/>(in DAT players this is in the form of ROM) controls how you put data on it.<br/>Most audio DAT applications record PCM at 16 bits per sample, and either<br/>44.1 KHz or 48 KHz or your choice of either as sampling rates. I believe<br/>sample sizes and sample rates are available for in DAT recorders, but I<br/>haven&apos;t seen them. NB: if you buy a DAT player, try to get one that will let<br/>you record 44.1 KHz, that way you won&apos;t have to do any tedious resampling if<br/>and when you want to burn to audio CD.</p><p>DVDs are a little wierder. DVD-audio is, in fact, PCM at 96 KHz, 24 bits per<br/>sample. However, there&apos;s a chance that DVD audio players will be made to be<br/>able to read PCM at 44.1/16, so that a much longer program can be put on one<br/>disc (we&apos;re talking the entire Ring cycle here). Video DVDs have audio, but<br/>it&apos;s never 96/24. Usually you can choose between PCM 44.1/16, or Dolby AC-3<br/>(which is not PCM and therefore doesn&apos;t really lend itself to sample rate<br/>and size comparisons), or the DTS format (see Dolby AC-3).</p><p>Hard drives and software do allow many formats, including several sample<br/>rate/sample sizes of PCM and others. You can even get AC-3/DTS authoring<br/>software.</p><p>Minidisc is more like AC-3 or MP3 in the sense that it doesn&apos;t make much<br/>sense to talk about sample sizes and sample rates. According to a site I<br/>visited the other day, the AVERAGE bit rate for ATRAC is supposed to be 2.3<br/>bps. That&apos;s not a sample size OR a sample rate, because in ATRAC encoding<br/>both of those can vary, based on the psychoacoustic analysis of the program<br/>material. If you do see sample size and/or rate information given regarding<br/>a Minidisc player, then it most likely refers to the sampled sound prior to<br/>encoding; the playback will not be at that quality.</p><p>Finally, as much as I love pontificating on my digital audio technology<br/>knowledge, I feel like we may be boring the other list members, who are<br/>probably interested in tuning.
