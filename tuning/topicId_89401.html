It has the same problem using the Farey sequence for a scale has--it isn&apos;t exactly regular. Note however that the even numbered steps are more generally consonant with the unison than the odd numbered steps, and the steps which are multiples of 4 have more oomph yet. In any case, I invite music from anyone who cares to try.</p><p>! sternbrocot4.scl<br/>level 4 of the Stern-Brocot tree<br/>16<br/>!<br/>6/5<br/>5/4<br/>9/7<br/>4/3<br/>11/8<br/>7/5<br/>10/7<br/>3/2<br/>11/7<br/>8/5<br/>13/8<br/>5/3<br/>12/7<br/>7/4<br/>9/5<br/>2</p></div>
