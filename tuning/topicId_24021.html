That is, a list that gets a tad<br/>out of<br/>control, with monologue artists not at all interested in conversation,<br/>well<br/>meaning good intentioned advice for how to run a list, differing<br/>priorities,<br/>etc.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen a tendency for Micro-folks to take some crap for a little<br/>while,<br/>then either leave a list (as i&apos;ve done twice), or create a new list<br/>with<br/>either a different stated goal, or a restricted membership.</p><p>How many more lists will there need to be, until attrition and boredom<br/>will<br/>drive off all the &quot;flamers&quot;?</p><p>We should act as a democracy, before making demands of the moderator.<br/>If a<br/>person posts something absurd, or inflammatory, ignore them. Utter<br/>silence.<br/>Should they persist, their presence being that of &quot;junk mail&quot;, one<br/>could ask (<br/>make a motion ) that they either stop posting drivel, or please leave<br/>the<br/>list. List members then would either yea, or nea, this motion. If the<br/>decided<br/>upon action failed to achieve it&apos;s intended goal, then a silent,<br/>capricious,<br/>heavy-handed moderator could banish that person from the list. But it<br/>should<br/>never come to this. We should be able to govern ourselves, not needing<br/>to<br/>watch our backs because there would be no need for a moderators<br/>disciplinary<br/>action.</p><p>My hope here, is to make this list work. Jacky may not have done<br/>everything<br/>perfect, ( the censoring act was well intended, but fairly pointless<br/>)but she<br/>has tried, and she is learning. Jacky probably never thought she would<br/>need to<br/>work this hard, let alone make such a comprehensive, boiler-plate laden<br/>statement just to gather a few people together in an atmosphere of<br/>congeniality, and sharing. My hope is that as a group, we can recognize<br/>that<br/>this forum is far from perfect, but before a defection, maybe we could<br/>grow,<br/>however painfully, into a list without equal ( if you have swelling,<br/>optimistic string music, play it now) . Patience and caring are all we<br/>need.</p><p>Let&apos;s work together, and get back to the business of composition.</p><p>Now, i&apos;d like to share a few thoughts about this list.</p><p>Let&apos;s face it, were ALL total Nut-cases. Brilliant minds, highly<br/>creative,<br/>energetic, and sometimes lacking in tact. When someone attacks, or<br/>tries to<br/>drive home an agenda, DON&apos;T TAKE IT PERSONALLY!!!!!<br/>Even if they mention your name directly. It&apos;s they who have a problem,<br/>not<br/>you. If anyone of you said something to me that was not germane to<br/>anything, i<br/>would ignore you, or kindly ask what was bothering you. If someone<br/>asked me<br/>how could i be so dumb as to utilize math in whatever way i saw fit, i<br/>would<br/>recognize that an insecurity existed, causing this persons behaviour.<br/>Anyone<br/>trying to tell me how i should write my own music, or what tools to<br/>use/ not<br/>use, is someone i would ignore. That person would not deserve an<br/>explanation,<br/>nor would i be inclined to defend my position. They don&apos;t like my work,<br/>my<br/>tools, my methods? Fine. Doesn&apos;t bother me in the slightest. If they<br/>find my<br/>thoughts, and the thoughts of others, as being stupid, they are free to<br/>leave<br/>this list. To my knowledge, no one is being forced to have a presence<br/>here.</p><p>Thank you for your time, and to Rick McGowan, thanks for asking about<br/>Elaine<br/>Walker, your question led me to also purchasing both ZIA albums, and i<br/>thank<br/>you for exposing me to them.</p><p>A toast, to the bidness!</p><p>George Zelenz</p></div>
