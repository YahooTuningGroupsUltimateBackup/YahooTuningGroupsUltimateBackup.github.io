I don&apos;t think it will work for this at all.  It doesn&apos;t seem to have any tuning support.  You could give it a set pre-tuned to the scale you&apos;re using, but that wouldn&apos;t be easy to switch tunings on.</p><p>However, Timidity should work fine on the same Raspberry Pi hardware. That&apos;s a SoundFont player with full tuning support.  You can make a SoundFont with the samples you want.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3>Vaughan McAlley &#x3C;ockegheim@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2015 6:55:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 28 June 2015 at 02:07, srijand@...

It would operate as a<br/>&quot;Black Box&quot;, hopefully turning Local Off via MIDI, and being<br/>controlled via special (unusual) note combinations. The user guide<br/>could then be entirely in musician-friendly musical notation.</p><p>Vaughan</p></div>
