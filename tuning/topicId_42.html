For MOS (WFS),<br/>which by definition have two and only two sizes of step interval<br/>(melodic seconds), if A and B are the two intervals, then propriety<br/>demands that the ratio A/B (in cents or logs) be between 1/2 and 2.</p><p>There are two exceptions to this assertion. For MOS (WFS) of the form N<br/>A&apos;s + 1 B, N =&gt; 2, and A &gt;B, A may be arbitrarily larger than B.<br/>Examples are 2 2 2 1, 9 9 9 9 2, etc. The other exception is the trivial<br/>case of just two intervals A B where A and B may have any proportion.</p><p>I would like to know of any other exceptions, corrections, etc. I once<br/>thought I had a semi-formal proof, but I can&apos;t reconstruct or find it<br/>today.</p><p>The above assertion does not apply to scales which repeat within the<br/>octave or other interval of equivalence, such as the modes of limited<br/>transposition of Messiaen, even if they have only 2 sizes of scale step.<br/>For example 5 1 5 1 in 12-tet is strictly proper. To compute propriety<br/>of scales of this type, one can use only 1 &quot;module&quot; and replace the IOE<br/>with the sum of the intervals of the module. The resulting difference<br/>matrix is termed &quot;reduced&quot; by Rothenberg.</p><p>&gt;What&apos;s a rank-order matrix?</p><p>CarI answered...</p><p>&gt;A graphic method of determining propriety, no matter how many unique<br/>&gt;interior intervals a scale has (Chalmers&apos; formula only works for two), is<br/>&gt;to construct its &quot;interval matrix&quot;.  This is just its tonality diamond.</p><p>The difference matrix is not the same as the Tonality Diamond. The<br/>difference matrix of a scale or chord is an array in which each row<br/>consists of the successive n-step intervals from each note. The first<br/>row contains the melodic seconds, the 2nd, the thirds, etc. through all<br/>scalar classes. The final row consists of the octave in whatever units<br/>it is measured. In practice, only the first N*(N-1)/2 entries of the<br/>first [N/2] rows need be considered.</p><p>For example, the Tonality Diamond of the major triad in 12 tet ( 0 4 7 )<br/>is</p><p>0&#x9;3&#x9;7  &#x9;where 0 is either 12 or 0. Note that the TD consists of<br/>9&#x9;0&#x9;4&#x9;of major triads built on the octave inversion of the major<br/>5&#x9;8&#x9;0&#x9;triad ( a minor triad on 5).</p><p>The Difference Matrix is</p><p>4&#x9;3&#x9;5&#x9;Note that the octave, the IOE, is added to the triad for<br/>7 &#x9;8 &#x9;9&#x9;the purpose of computing intervals. The first row consists<br/>12&#x9;12&#x9;12&#x9;of the successive intervals (major third, minor third, 4th).<br/>The next row contains the sums of every two adjacent intervals, and the<br/>last the sum of every 3 (which completes the octave here.) All summation<br/>is done &quot;end around&quot; or toroidally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To make a &quot;rank-order matrix&quot;, take this diamond (sic) and replace each<br/>&gt;interval&apos;s logarithmic magnitude with an integer ranking its size relative<br/>&gt;to all the &gt;other intervals....</p><p>Correct if one is using the DM and working in JI. Otherwise, use the<br/>tempered intervals directly. By ranking, assigning 1 to the smallest<br/>interval, 2 to the next smallest, etc. is meant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The idea is that several scales, each having a different interval matrix,<br/>&gt;may all be perceived as re-tunings of each other if they share the same<br/>rank-&gt;order matrix.</p><p>True. They are presumed to fall into the same &quot;equivalence class&quot; and<br/>tend to be heard are different tunings of each other. However, this is<br/>somewhat dependent upon the listener&apos;s discrimination and expectation.<br/>While the major scale in<br/>JI, Pythagorean tuning and 12-tet are in different EC&apos;s, many listeners<br/>will<br/>hear them as separate tunings if they ignore the commas and smaller<br/>intervallic discrepancies. (in JI, the major mode is strictly proper; in<br/>Pythag, improper; and in 12-tet, proper).</p><p>In other ET&apos;s, it depends on whether Pythagorean or JI is being<br/>approximated.<br/>The 7-tone fifth-generated MOS&apos;s in 17 and 22 are improper, the scale 4<br/>3 2 4 3 4 2 in 22-tet is proper, and the scale 3 2 1 3 2 3 1 in 15-tet<br/>is improper.</p><p>The rest looks pretty clear to me.</p><p>--John</p></div>
