The subdominant tone as a part of the V7 is actually not<br/>bad, since the fifths are sharp and therefore the fourths are flat.</p><p>I&apos;ve mentioned the 6/27 generator before, and it&apos;s a nice one, giving<br/>us a 12-note scale of pattern (2223)x3 and a 15-note scale of pattern<br/>(22221)x3; since it has a 7-complexity of 9 we do have quite a few<br/>complete tetrads. We also have a 9/27 generator, giving us a (12)x9<br/>18-note scale. If someone wants to call the 12-note scale a<br/>temperament and see how that works, I say go for it.</p><p>The 7/27 generator has a 7-complexity of 10, and we might like the 11-<br/>note scale with pattern 11511511515 or the 15-note scale with pattern<br/>111411141114114 with that. It should be noted that the lack of<br/>Myhill&apos;s property won&apos;t actually give you musical cooties, and you<br/>can use 1114115115114, 1114114115114 or 1114111411141113, etc if you<br/>like!</p><p>We can go for the circle of fifths/fourths if we want also, and in<br/>this case that means a 7-complexity of 11 and some scales that ought<br/>to make even Margo sit up in her chairÂ—-a Goth diatonic with pattern<br/>5515551, and a sore-temperament with pattern 114141141414.</p><p>28-et</p><p>The 28-et uses, old, recycled fifths from the 7-et which at over 16<br/>cents are really quite flat, but it has excellent major thirds and<br/>decent 7s and 11s, though since the 11 is sharp it doesn&apos;t work as<br/>well as it might. What interests me about it the most is the<br/>8/28 = 2/7 generator, which gives us scales with the remarkably low<br/>7-complexity of 4, for instance (2221)x4 at 16 notes and (223)x4 at<br/>12 notes, which once again is worth looking at as a sort of exotic<br/>12-tone temperament as well as a scale.</p><p>29-et</p><p>This division was first considered by someone who was aiming at the<br/>31-et, and missed; here I am talking about it deliberately! It&apos;s<br/>about the same for the 5-limit and decidedly in better tune for the<br/>7-limit than the 12-et, and if people can stand the 12-et they can<br/>stand this one too, though flatness rather than sharpness may be a<br/>problem for ears attuned to the 12-et.</p><p>With a complexity of 7, the 3/29 generator is worth consideration; it<br/>gives us a 9-note scale with pattern 333333335 and one of 10 steps<br/>that tries hard to be the 10-et and doesn&apos;t quite make it:<br/>3333333332.</p><p>34-et</p><p>The 34-et 7, 15.88 cents flat, is so much worse that its triads that<br/>there is a tendency to view it as a triad-machine, without much value<br/>in the 7-limit or beyond. However, the low 7-complexity of 6 for the<br/>9/34 generator belies that notion. And we might note the lousy 7s<br/>aren&apos;t nearly as lousy as those of the 12-et! It has a 7-note scale<br/>with pattern 2727277, a nice 11-note scale for fans of 11-note<br/>scales, with pattern 22522522525, and a 15-note scale with pattern<br/>222322232223223.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2001 11:42:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p>&gt; 28-et<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 28-et uses, old, recycled fifths from the 7-et which at over 16<br/>&gt; cents are really quite flat, but it has excellent major thirds and<br/>&gt; decent 7s and 11s, though since the 11 is sharp it doesn&apos;t work as<br/>&gt; well as it might.

I posted this observation many years ago on rec.music.compose. A couple of years<br/>ago, I told Dan Stearns that I&apos;d like to explore all the ETs from 26 to 31, inclusive (30-tET allows<br/>for 10-tET and 15-tET to be explored), on guitar. Given that 26, 27, 28, and 30 have<br/>somewhat out-of-tune fifths, and that the nylon-string guitar is both very permissive for<br/>out-of-tune fifths and the best type of guitar for Mark Rankin&apos;s interchangeable fingerboards, I<br/>think I&apos;m going to implement this with six fingerboards (Mark usually provides four but I&apos;m sure<br/>he can be &quot;flexible&quot;).</p><p>22-tET is still my favorite, though . . .

Can you go into more detail on the<br/>harmonic resources of the<br/>&gt; 7- and 11-note scales you mention?</p><p>I could, but they are circle-of-minor-thirds scales of a kind you<br/>know about already. We have 5/19 &lt; 9/34 &lt; 4/15, and 9/34 is a lot<br/>like 5/19, though on his web page Keenan seemed uncertain if it<br/>should be included. The 9/34 generator can also be described as the<br/>19-15 system (19 white keys and 15 black keys); all of these have<br/>49/48 and 126/125 in the kernel, so that 8/7 and 7/6 are represented<br/>by the same note, and 25/21, which is a 5/3 up followed by 5/7 down,<br/>counts as a minor third. The 9/34 generator is a 1/4-kleisma<br/>temperament, if that is marginal I don&apos;t know what to say about 4/15,<br/>which is over 1/2 kleisma. However, the 15-et still smoothes things<br/>out so far as scale step size goes. So far as triads go, the sharp 15<br/>tends to cancel the flat 19, but it doesn&apos;t help with the 7: the 19<br/>has it 408 relative cents flat, the 15 132 rc flat, and so the 34 has<br/>it the sum of the two, or 408 rc flat. (To get absolute cents from<br/>relative cents, just divide by the number of steps in the octave of<br/>the scale division.)</p><p>You might find the following 7-note PB interesting; it&apos;s based on<br/>commas of 49/48 and 126/125, with a chroma of 10/9:</p><p>1--7/6--6/5--7/5--10/7--5/3--12/7--(2)</p><p>The 15-et represents 50/49 and 36/35 by one step and 7/6 by three<br/>steps, so it is a little more regular than 19, which does it by four<br/>vs. one step. The 34-et of course is in between; the small steps are<br/>2/34 and the 7/6 is 7/34.</p></div>
