(Forget the Pythagorean<br/>&gt;third. It is way too sharp.)</p><p>Gerald, this seems odd. In our off-list discussion, you told me that the<br/>singers sing a major third _higher_ than the 12-tET one in a major triad,<br/>and yet now you say the Pythagorean third is _way_ too sharp. There is only<br/>8 cents difference between the two. 8 cents is about the smallest<br/>distinguishable melodic interval.</p><p>&gt;(It also seems unlikely that this &quot;high third&quot;<br/>&gt;is a product of culture, since it appears to be arrived at in terms of<br/>&gt;consonance, as opposed to learned preference.)</p><p>I don&apos;t know how you propose to back up that assertion. In fact, studies<br/>have shown that untrained listeners tend to fall into two groups, one group<br/>preferring a just major triad, and another group preferring a major triad<br/>with the third either 15 cents sharp (as in 12-tET) or 15 cents flat, over<br/>the just major triad. I would argue that these listeners have been<br/>conditioned by a lifetime of exposure to the characteristic beating thirds<br/>of 12-tET.</p><p>&gt;Also, diminished triads, contrary to Mr. Wolf&apos;s description, in my<br/>&gt;experience seem NOT to conform to a tempered configuration.</p><p>Gerald, Mr. Wolf was speaking specifically of diminished _seventh_ chords,<br/>not diminished triads. Besides augmented triads, another class of chords<br/>that cry out for tempering are those consisting of 4-7 consecutive fifths,<br/>such as a major chord with added 6th and 9th.</p></div><h3><a id=7247 href="#7247">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

If a C-E major<br/>third is tuned 4:5 = 1/5:1/4 (0&#xFFFD; 386&#xFFFD;), the lowest common overtone is an E<br/>two octaves higher, and if this overtone &quot;stands out&quot; and is heard in some<br/>semi-conscious way, it melodically agrees with, or reinforces the chord. If<br/>a G is now added to the chord, with tuning 4:5:6 = 1/15:1/12:1/10 (0&#xFFFD; 386&#xFFFD;<br/>702&#xFFFD;), the lowest common overtone is B three octaves higher, and if this B<br/>is heard in some way, it may not be desirable since it is not one of the<br/>notes in the chord. However, if the major third is raised, as you claim, and<br/>specifically, the chord is tuned 1/24:1/19:1/16 (0&#xFFFD; 404&#xFFFD; 702&#xFFFD;), the lowest<br/>common overtone is a G four octaves higher, agreeing with the chord.</p><p>It could be that to reliably approximate the equal-tempered major triad<br/>they&apos;re used to hearing, singers have learned to focus on the 16th harmonic<br/>(four octaves above) the G, and learn to eliminate the beating among the<br/>partials of the three notes at that pitch by adjusting the tuning of the<br/>major third to 24:19. When the C-E third is unaccompanied, the sensation at<br/>that high G is too weak and the singers have to resort to a simple 5:4.</p><p>This is the best hypothesis I can think of to support your observation,<br/>Gerald. Whether it&apos;s valid or not, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find, once you measure<br/>some examples, that your &quot;high third&quot; of stable, held major triads is far<br/>closer to 404&#xFFFD; (24:19) than to 435&#xFFFD; (9:7). And again, I think the acoustical<br/>pull of 4:5:6 is much greater than that of 1/24:1/19:1/16 and the former is<br/>used in contexts, such as barbershop and Renaissance works, where a sense of<br/>complete blending is the desideratum.</p></div><h3><a id=7840 href="#7840">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx</h3><span>1/16/2000 2:38:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt;&gt;Gerald, you&apos;re being misled by these ratios. 45/32 and 27/16 form a 4:5:6<br/>&gt;&gt;triad with 9/8, so with 9/8 there, they would be very easy to &quot;lock into&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;To be fair, I agree that these ratios alone would be too difficult to lock<br/>&gt;&gt;into on their own, but that was not the context here -- it was a full chord.</p><p>Jerry wrote,</p><p>&gt;Thanks, Paul. I&apos;m still wrestling with the number jargon here on the List.<br/>&gt;Every little bit helps.</p><p>&gt;Jerry</p><p>&gt;&gt;That is the usual take on Indian music, where the just (5/4) and Pythagorean<br/>&gt;&gt;(81/64) major thirds are sruti #s 7 and 8 out of a 22-sruti octave. Now it<br/>&gt;&gt;is true that the Pythagorean major third wouldn&apos;t lock harmonically as part<br/>&gt;&gt;of a triad, so for the third time I suggest the possibility of<br/>&gt;&gt;1/24:1/19:1/16 for your locked major triad with high third.</p><p>&gt;For now the second time in a post to you (and the third if you count another<br/>&gt;to someone else) I am requesting a clarification of what appear to be<br/>&gt;fractions separated by colons. Please unlock the code. For example, how does<br/>&gt;the expression 4/5 relate to the expression 4:5?</p><p>They often mean the same thing, but 4/5 (usually 5/4) often has the addition<br/>significance of representing a pitch 5:4 above a root or tonic, which is denoted<br/>as 1/1.</p><p>&gt;Also, what does 1/x<br/>&gt;represent?</p><p>Just what you would think. For example, the usual JI minor triad has a 5:6<br/>between root and third, a 4:5 between third and fifth, and a 2:3 between root and<br/>fifth. These ratios can be combined in (at least) two ways to give a three-term<br/>&quot;ratio&quot; for the chord. They are:</p><p>10:12:15<br/>1/6:1/5:1/4</p><p>If you calculate the interval between root and third in the first chord, you get<br/>10/12=5/6. Similarly, if you calculate the interval between root and third in the<br/>second chord, you get (1/6)/(1/5) = 5/6. And so on. These two representations of<br/>the chord are called &quot;otonal&quot; and &quot;utonal&quot; respectively, since they relate to the<br/>overtone series and the undertone series. The undertone series is best understood<br/>as the series of fundamentals under a common overtone. Every JI chord can be<br/>expressed both ways, though many chords look simpler one way or the other. For<br/>example, the minor triad above uses smaller numbers in the utonal representation,<br/>so it is usually considered a utonal chord. The major triad&apos;s two representations<br/>are</p><p>4:5:6<br/>1/15:1/12:1/10</p><p>and since the first is simpler, it is usually considered an otonal chord.</p><p>The earlier example was of a chord with pitches 1/1 7/4 9/8 45/32 27/16. I made<br/>the assertion that the 45/32 and 27/16 would be easy to tune with the 9/8 since<br/>they form a 4:5:6 major triad with it. Check: (9/8)/(45/32) = 4/5, (9/8)/(27/16)<br/>= 2/3, and of course, (45/32)/(27/16) = 5/6.</p><p>&gt;I really would like to know what you are saying here. Can someone<br/>&gt;whose math training ended at college algebra have a fighting chance of<br/>&gt;understanding? I hope this is simply a matter of form rather than of depth.</p><p>So far, no algebra, just multiplying and dividing fractions.</p></div><h3><a id=8727 href="#8727">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2000 11:17:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jerry wrote,</p><p>&gt;Perhaps you missed it, Paul.

The reason I assume that it may<br/>not be<br/>&gt;relevant is that tonal music appears to have been developed vocally<br/>in most<br/>&gt;world cultures. Sure, that is an assumption on my part, but I am<br/>choosing to<br/>&gt;believe that instruments--whether tempered or free--had little to do<br/>with<br/>&gt;the development of tonal music. My experience with &quot;new ears&quot; (as<br/>opposed to<br/>&gt;&quot;tone deaf) shows that they frequently sing a fourth or fifth below<br/>a given<br/>&gt;pitch to be matched. I find that very significant and relevant to<br/>the point.<br/>&gt;I have to believe that the ancients &quot;discovered&quot; tonal music in a<br/>similar<br/>&gt;way.</p><p>Fifths and fourths arose vocally -- I believe you&apos;re absolutely right.<br/>Tonal music, with functional triads, major and minor keys, and<br/>modulation -- those only arose in Europe in a specific environment --<br/>one laden with composers at meantone-tuned keyboards. Even in the<br/>century before Monteverdi, the triadic language was to some extent<br/>predicated on the compromises of meantone -- see Blackwood&apos;s book.<br/>Jerry, if this issue interests you (and since you are an author), I<br/>suggest you at least read Daniel Wolf&apos;s recent, and Margo Schulter&apos;s<br/>forthcoming, comments on this issue.</p><p>Particularly interesting for you, though on a slightly different<br/>topic, would be for you to read the comments of musicians in various<br/>decades of the 18th century on the issue of temperament. Many of them<br/>were clearly as attuned to the tuning practices of their time as you<br/>are to those of today, and reading their reactions, and the way their<br/>reactions change between the 1720s and 1750s may force you to<br/>reconsider your apparent assumption about the level of ignorance with<br/>respect to tuning that existed among musicians at that time.<br/>Jorgenson&apos;s big book _Tuning_ contains a few enlightening quotes along<br/>these lines.</p></div><h3><a id=8744 href="#8744">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2000 9:54:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Perhaps you missed it, Paul.

If my hundreds of<br/>students were relying on a memory of 12-tET, why do they tune the third<br/>below piano pitch before the fifth is sounded, and why do they consistently<br/>move it above piano pitch while the fifth is sounding? Granted my &quot;demo&quot; had<br/>problems, but it did show a narrower third (albeit nearly at the piano pitch<br/>because of the basses sharp root) near the beginning of the example and a<br/>larger third near the end. To my ear, neither of these thirds were 12-tET.</p><p>There is no doubt that many if not most student singers tend to imitate<br/>piano pitch, but after they gain the concept of locked tuning, they<br/>consistently tune the major third as I have described. I repeat, I&apos;m not<br/>here to prove anything--merely to understand it. If you simply dismiss my<br/>description in these illogical ways, neither one of us will learn much.</p><p>I said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;When I got it home, I noticed the flaws that I described on my post.<br/>&gt;&gt;Nevertheless, it clearly demonstrated the phenomenon, so I went with<br/>&gt;&gt;it--mess and all.</p><p>Paul said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is how I heard your example: The basses come in quite sharp of<br/>&gt; the tonic, and with very uncertain pitch.

It was the new one, for which tuning to something other than the<br/>piano is still somewhat uncertain. Therefore, when she hears the piano&apos;s<br/>third she likely went for it out of habit. This does not influence the final<br/>placement of the third, however, as the demo shows. If the singers were<br/>being influenced by memory of 12-tET, they would have stayed with the<br/>piano&apos;s third. They clearly did not.</p><p>&gt; and then, as the fifth is introduced (with a bit of a struggle),<br/>&gt; the interval between the bass and soprano does not appear to change<br/>&gt; in any essential way -- perhaps they both drift up a few more cents,<br/>&gt; so that the piano third sounds flat in comparison.</p><p>Upon listening to the demo again, I admit I&apos;ve heard better locks on the<br/>high third. However, I don&apos;t think the basses moved again after they settled<br/>into their pitch before the fifth sounded. And, most importantly, the new<br/>position of the sopranos results in a &quot;brighter&quot; third than the initial one,<br/>a &quot;flavor&quot; characteristic of the high third.</p><p>&gt; I certainly don&apos;t<br/>&gt; hear an acoustical &quot;locking&quot; occuring at two distinct values for the major<br/>&gt; third in this example.</p><p>Do you mean you don&apos;t hear _any locking? Or do you mean the &quot;two&quot; thirds are<br/>not different? As you would know, your answer to these questions is<br/>important.
