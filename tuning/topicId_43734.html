He is the author of &quot;Temperament&quot; and editor of Piano<br/>Today magazine.</p><p>Dear Johnny:<br/>I wanted to tell you that I think your Brandenburg 2 is very beautiful --<br/>the performance was sensitive, thoughtful and very musically satisfying to<br/>me. I know I promised to get back to you quickly about this CD, but I wanted<br/>to revisit some Brandenburg recordings I had at home for comparison<br/>purposes: Gustav Leonhardt&apos;s, with Frans Br&uuml;ggen, and Pablo Casals&apos; with the<br/>Marlboro Festival Orchestra. I find your tempos more to my liking than<br/>either of the others. The Werckmeister tuning is not &quot;in your face,&quot; but<br/>adds a very subtle tonal shading that brings a lively, interesting quality<br/>to the overall sound and, I think, increases the independence of the<br/>individual voices. It is the &quot;aliveness&quot; that I find so attractive here,<br/>something you achieve without the ridiculously rapid tempo that Casals<br/>resorts to (and in his case, the attempt fails to deliver).</p><p>So, Bravo! Thank you for the CD, and for all your good efforts on behalf of<br/>music. I hope we get to see each other sometime soon.</p><p>All best wishes,<br/>Stuart</p></div>
