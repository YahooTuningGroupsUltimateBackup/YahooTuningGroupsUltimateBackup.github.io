But to me, this is just a way of describing what the<br/>chord sounds like, not how to play it on a keyboard. Note however, that it<br/>_does_ help with how to play it on a guitar (assuming the open strings are<br/>still tuned near to usual). I think diatonic and chromatic are so<br/>entrenched that it doesn&apos;t matter how many scale degrees an interval spans<br/>in some weird scale, if it&apos;s an approximate 1:2 it&apos;s an octave, if it&apos;s an<br/>approximate 2:3 it&apos;s a fifth etc. etc.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div>
