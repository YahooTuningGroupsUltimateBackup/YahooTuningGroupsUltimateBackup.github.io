You would<br/>instruct the software in real-time (foot pedals?  many means are<br/>possible) what subset of 72-tET will be active at a given moment.

Does your music not make use of C-A-D-G-C progressions?<br/>Does it not matter if the music drifts?  Or are you willing to correct<br/>the drift in one sudden motion of a 72-tET microtone?
