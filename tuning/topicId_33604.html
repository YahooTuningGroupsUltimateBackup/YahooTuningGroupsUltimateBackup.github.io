Any advice on latest sound cards<br/>&gt;with higher sample rate than 96KHz would be appreciated!!!</p><p>No. In all honesty, these really high rates may not give significantly<br/>&apos;better&apos; quality of sound. It&apos;s more to do with the quality of<br/>converters and circuitry used. They may just cause more disk space to<br/>be eaten up and more powerful computing being necessary.<br/>A cheap card with 96khz sampling may not sound better than a dear one<br/>at 48khz with good components (like apogee, perhaps)</p><p>&gt;The Akai professional Z8 and Z4  seem to be a good alternative to avoid<br/>&gt;clicks on the computer while using high sample rates of 96 KHz with a 128<br/>&gt;note poliphony (64 stereo), plus also the tuning resolution is not bad at<br/>&gt;all!</p><p>Have you looked at the Symbolic Sound Kyma / Capybarra system ?<br/>It has sampling capabilities, freedom concerning tuning (0.0026 Hz<br/>resolution) and just about every other aspect of Digital Signal<br/>Processing.<br/>It&apos;s not going to be much more expensive, for a fully expanded one,<br/>than what you suggest already ;) Ah, Kyma :)<br/>Not for the faint hearted (or time lacking) peeps though :)</p><p>Even most of Native Instruments soft synthesisers have great tuning<br/>ability too.
