This, where the adjustments are made<br/>from within a limited set of pitch resources, is in opposition<br/>to the idea kicked around here recently of &apos;adaptive JI&apos;, where<br/>the adjustments are calculated by means of error-averaging.</p><p>There have been two postings here in response to my posting<br/>on this Beethoven experiment.  How about some feedback about<br/>the actual audio example itself?  I&apos;m interested to know what<br/>the rest of you hear and what you have to say about it.</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/beethove/son9schz.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/beethove/son9schz.htm</a></p><p>I should probably also acknowledge (before someone else does)<br/>my belief in the appropriateness of rather extreme _rubato_ in<br/>the tempos of a lot of different types of non-dance-oriented<br/>music, and my full application of it here.</p><p>Joseph L.
