So<br/>these are<br/>&gt; 13-24 equal tunings. They&apos;re not properly temperaments of anything;<br/>they<br/>&gt; just consist of a number of equal sized intervals per octave.</p><p>why would you say that? certainly the way blackwood used them, many<br/>of these tunings *are* temperaments. in the abstract, you can look at<br/>the chart and table on this page</p><p><a href="http://www.sonic-arts.org/dict/eqtemp.htm">http://www.sonic-arts.org/dict/eqtemp.htm</a></p><p>and determine how to derive *most* of these equal tunings as 5-limit<br/>temperaments.</p><p>presumably it&apos;s familiar to many readers that 12-equal can be derived<br/>by tempering out the usual &quot;comma&quot; that&apos;s tempered out in all<br/>meantones -- the syntonic comma or 81:80 -- and then tempering out an<br/>additional small interval representing the ratio between &quot;enharmonic<br/>equivalents&quot; like G#:Ab -- such as 648:625 (the &quot;major diesis&quot;),<br/>128:125 (the usual &quot;diesis&quot;), 2048:2025 (the &quot;diaschisma&quot;),<br/>32805:32768 (the &quot;schisma&quot;), or 531441:524288 (the &quot;pythagorean<br/>comma&quot;). on the chart, you&apos;ll see that the green lines corresponding<br/>to these intervals, labeled &apos;meantone&apos;, &apos;diminished&apos;, &apos;augmented&apos;,<br/>&apos;schismic&apos;, and &apos;aristoxenean&apos; respectively (in accord with the table<br/>below the chart), all intersect at the big number *12*, making it<br/>easy to read this information off the chart.</p><p>one instance of *13* is at the intersection of the &apos;magic&apos; and &apos;beep&apos;<br/>lines, so 13-equal can be derived from 5-limit JI by tempering out<br/>3125:3072 and 27:25.</p><p>another instance of *13* is at the intersection of the &apos;father&apos;<br/>and &apos;tetracot&apos; lines, so 13-equal can be derived from 5-limit JI by<br/>tempering out 16:15 (missing from monz&apos;s table) and 20000:19683.</p><p>27:25 and 16:15 are unlikely intervals to temper out when using<br/>harmonic timbres, but the next two are solidly derived as<br/>temperaments and reflect the patterns of blackwood&apos;s highly triadic<br/>usage:</p><p>*15* is at the intersection of<br/>the &apos;blackwood&apos;, &apos;augmented&apos;, &apos;kleismic&apos;, and &apos;porcupine&apos; lines, so<br/>15-equal can be derived from 5-limit JI by tempering out any two of<br/>256:243, 128:125, 15625:15552, and 250:243.</p><p>*16* is at the intersection of the &apos;diminished&apos;, &apos;pelogic&apos;,<br/>and &apos;magic&apos; lines, so 16-equal can be derived from 5-limit JI by<br/>tempering out any two of 648:625, 135:128, and 3125:3072.</p><p>one instance of *17* is at the intersection of the &apos;schismic&apos;<br/>and &apos;dicot&apos; lines, so 17-equal can be derived from 5-limit JI by<br/>tempering out 32805:32768 and 25:24. blackwood&apos;s usage actually<br/>corresponds to the *another* instance of 17, on the extreme left on<br/>the &apos;meantone&apos; line.</p><p>*18* is at the intersection of the &apos;augmented&apos; and &apos;semisuper&apos; lines,<br/>so 18-equal can be derived from 5-limit JI by tempering out 128:125<br/>and 6115295232:6103515625. admittedly, situations where the latter<br/>interval needs to be tempered out will probably be quite rare, and<br/>when they occur, will usually be handled with more accurate<br/>temperaments.</p><p>*19* is at the intersection of<br/>the &apos;meantone&apos;, &apos;negri&apos;, &apos;magic&apos;, &apos;kleismic&apos;, and &apos;semisixths&apos; lines,<br/>so 19-equal can be derived from 5-limit JI by tempering out any two<br/>of 81:80, 16875:16384, 3125:3072, 15625:15552, and 78732:78125.</p><p>one instance of *20* is at the intersection of<br/>the &apos;blackwood&apos;, &apos;diminished&apos;, and &apos;tetracot&apos; lines, so 20-equal can<br/>be derived from 5-limit JI by tempering out any two of 256:243,<br/>648:625, and 20000:19683.</p><p>one instance of *21* is at the intersection of the &apos;augmented&apos;<br/>and &apos;escapade&apos; lines, so 21-equal can be derived from 5-limit JI by<br/>tempering out 128:125 and 4294967296:4271484375. admittedly,<br/>situations where the latter interval needs to be tempered out will<br/>probably be quite rare, and when they occur, will usually be handled<br/>with more accurate temperaments.</p><p>*22* is at the intersection of the &apos;diaschismic&apos;, &apos;magic&apos;,<br/>and &apos;porcupine&apos; lines, so 22-equal can be derived from 5-limit JI by<br/>tempering out any two of 2048:2025, 3125:3072, and 250:243.</p><p>*23* is at the intersection of the &apos;pelogic&apos; and &apos;kleismic&apos; lines, so<br/>23-equal can be derived from 5-limit JI by tempering out 135:128 and<br/>15625:15552.</p><p>*14* and *24* appear on the chart too, superimposed upon 7 and 12<br/>respectively, since they temper out the same commas as their halfling<br/>kin. but only half the notes of these larger tunings can be<br/>reasonably said to derive from a single instance of 5-limit JI -- the<br/>other half are &quot;incompatible&quot; and truly result, as you imply, from<br/>constructing equal-sized intervals bisecting those of 7- and 12-equal<br/>respectively.</p><p>i&apos;ll be more than happy to answer questions if anyone&apos;s confused (i<br/>assume someone must be!), and also to describe how the *next* (&quot;small<br/>5-limit intervals&quot;) chart on that webpage helps one to understand the<br/>information above when used in conjuction with the &quot;honeycomb&quot;<br/>lattices of the ETs:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/15.gif">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/15.gif</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/22.gif">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/perlich/22.gif</a></p><p>(there are more like these on the tuning-math list)</p></div><h3><a id=47161 href="#47161">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2003 2:36:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

(i.e. 5-limit linear has *one*,<br/>&gt; but 5-limit ET needs *two..* etc.??)</p><p>each comma you temper out reduces the number of infinite dimensions<br/>in the lattice by one. so if you start with the 5-limit JI lattice,<br/>which has two infinite dimensions, and temper out one comma, you end<br/>up with a linear temperament, with only one infinite dimension. in<br/>the direction of the comma you tempered out, you no longer have<br/>infinitude, just repetition. hopefully _the forms of tonality_ makes<br/>this clear. now if you temper out another comma, you can get very<br/>close to *any* point in the lattice by moving some number of the<br/>first comma and some number of the second comma, which of course<br/>amounts to *zero* pitch movement, and then a few small steps will get<br/>you to the point you want. hopefully the &quot;honeycombs&quot; of various ETs<br/>you were just looking at make this clear. thus the entire lattice now<br/>contains only a small, finite number of intervals, with repetition in<br/>*every* direction that you look. assuming you did the tempering<br/>regularly, this means an equal temperament. in two dimensions, it<br/>requires the tempering-out of two independent commas to ge this<br/>condition.</p><p>if you&apos;re used to thinking of linear temperaments in terms of<br/>generator, note that the generator of a linear temperament can, in<br/>general, be stacked upon itself an infinite number of times and never<br/>yield the same (octave-reduced) pitch twice. thus, again, linear<br/>temperaments have one dimension of infinitude. now if you temper out<br/>*another* comma (not the one which defined the linear temperament in<br/>the first place), which will at this point have to correspond to some<br/>number of generators (and periods) in the linear temperament, you&apos;re<br/>turning the infinite chain of generators into a circle; i.e., an<br/>equal temperament.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; So, actually, equal temperament is a kind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of &quot;two dimensional&quot; temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; rather, it&apos;s a kind of &quot;zero dimensional&quot; temperament, since<br/>you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; reduced the number of infinite dimensions in the lattice down to<br/>&gt; &gt; zero, and end up with a finite set of pitches. it&apos;s the original<br/>5-<br/>&gt; &gt; limit lattice that&apos;s two dimensional, really.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***That&apos;s fascinating to try to visualize...
