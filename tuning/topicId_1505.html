After the duration i &quot;felt&quot;<br/>the absence of 13/8 more strongly than the 11/8 which was almost a relief when i<br/>switched it off.<br/>Pat Pagano<br/>SEJIS</p><p><a href="mailto:Ascend11@aol.com">Ascend11@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:Ascend11@aol.com">Ascend11@aol.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Some time back I prepared synthesized 13 - ratio intervals to listen to, and<br/>&gt; in contrast with the impressions of several people here who found 13/8 to<br/>&gt; sound<br/>&gt; more consonant than 11/8, I found the 13 - ratio intervals, including 13/8,<br/>&gt; to sound less mentally graspable than the 11 - ratio intervals.
