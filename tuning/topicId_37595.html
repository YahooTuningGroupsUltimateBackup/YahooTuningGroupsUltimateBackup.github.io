The reason is that I believe I can hear a difference and I have auditioned and<br/>compared.  But, and this is important, when I return to working with some of the ETs that I know<br/>and find to be of musical value, I will no doubt report on their unique musical properties.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Well if you keep telling me that my experiences are not true there&apos;s not<br/>&gt; &gt;much I can say or do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you saying you experienced every ET suitable for acoustic instruments?</p><p>Well, what do you think Carl?  Of course not and I&apos;ve no intention of trying to. What I&apos;m saying<br/>is that I heard clearly a phenomenon, musically useful, inspiring and quite unexpected, that I&apos;ve<br/>never heard when working with or listening to ETs. Caveat - one human being, even one who spends<br/>hours with JI and ETs can only be reasonably expected to audition very few of the infinite<br/>possibilities. And I&apos;m saying that I don&apos;t believe I&apos;ll hear this particular phenomenon with ETs<br/>because I haven&apos;t done yet. I might in the future change my mind but I&apos;d rather hear for myself<br/>than see it on paper.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since the scale in discussion is a subset of an ET, you&apos;ve experienced<br/>&gt; every ET subset as well?</p><p>I don&apos;t know what scale you&apos;re referring to here. And of course I&apos;ve not experienced every ET<br/>subset as well.</p><p>I hope this clarifies my position.
