It allows scales to be created, manipulated and combined in<br/>many different ways. A large library of scales is available for it. It<br/>can tune various different synthesizers and samplers via standard<br/>MIDI-files. To install, unpack <a href="http://scala.zip">scala.zip</a> in an empty directory and<br/>read the readme.txt file.<br/>After startup, HELP shows the commands, and <a href="https://twitter.com/HELP">@HELP</a> creates a window<br/>with the help text.</p><p>Version 1.6 is an update with about 10% more functionality than 1.5.<br/>Some bugs were fixed.</p><p>Some of its new features:</p><p>- A notation system for just intervals is implemented which shows<br/>the 3-limit name, plus or minus commas.<br/>- Many other new notation systems were added.<br/>- The name for degree 0 is now no longer restricted to C.<br/>- Transformation of scales between systems with compatible<br/>notations: REPLACE/NOTATION.<br/>- The same feature can be used in translating scores into microtuned<br/>MIDI files with the EXAMPLE command. If names are used to denote<br/>notes, then one (equal) temperament can be changed for another without<br/>altering the score.<br/>- The SHOW DATA command gives more values, such as Rothenberg Efficiency<br/>and Stability.<br/>- SHOW DATA now detects if a scale is a chain of identical triads.<br/>- Consistent representations of any ratio in equal temperaments can<br/>be found: DIVIDE/CONSISTENT.<br/>- The least maximum error approximation to a scale can be found;<br/>for an octave based chain of fifths: CALCULATE/MINIMAX and for a<br/>non-octave based equal temperament: FIT/MINIMAX.<br/>- Pitches can now be selected based on numeric attribute values:<br/>LIMIT/MAX_ATTRIB and LIMIT/MIN_ATTRIB.<br/>- Some commands accept a wider range of parameters and more options.<br/>- The mode and interval lists were expanded.</p><p>Below is the list of commands that are new in this version:</p><p>Approximate/Insert<br/>Calculate/Minimax<br/>Calculate/Minimax/Nooutput<br/>Delete/Egalize<br/>Divide/Consistent<br/>Fit/Minimax<br/>Limit/Max_Attrib<br/>Limit/Min_Attrib<br/>Load/Cents<br/>Replace/Notation<br/>Save/Cents<br/>Save/Cents/Keep_Text<br/>Set Factor<br/>Set Offset<br/>Set Tolerance<br/>Show/Scale Locations<br/>Show Notation</p><p>Thanks to Heinz Bohlen, Christopher Chapman, John Clough, Paul Erlich,<br/>Carl Lumma, Dave Keenan, Joe Monzo and John Pusey.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div>
