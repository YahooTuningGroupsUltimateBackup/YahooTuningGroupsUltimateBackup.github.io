Found it by accident.</p><p>See - there are a few theorems and otherwise useful operations<br/>that don&apos;t necessarily come from any isolateable principle,<br/>but that definitely include the above example.<br/>It pretty much drains back to modular arithmetic.</p><p>Evidently, if you were to pick some 8- or 9- digit number out of a hat,<br/>that temperament would be able to approximate any interval<br/>to *well* within a fraction of what you call a cent.<br/>Any temperament higher than 1201<br/>is automatically less than a cent away from everything.</p><p>After studying the resources of the Brun algorithm, though,<br/>besides useful lists of temperaments in a vague sense,<br/>and besides the hint of discreet web convergence, (q.v. a day or so ago)<br/>there arises a sort of hint of magnetism,<br/>(which for some reason we nicknamed it &quot;polarity&quot;... ha.)<br/>wherein if you look at the [proportional] accuracies<br/>of the driving intervals as the algorithm progresses,<br/>it&apos;s not so much that obviously when you hit 78005<br/>that everything&apos;s getting a lot closer just by increase in number,<br/>but there&apos;s almost an inverse square effect,<br/>when you see the [proportional] accuracies<br/>are being systematically diminished.<br/>This makes enough sense if you imagine the entire web convergence<br/>of any one temperament, in an algortihm, for specific a set of intervals,<br/>is going to be *more* accurate than the previous temperament,<br/>this places more of a burden on the intervals to *be* more accurate.<br/>(qv qv qv)</p><p>Again there&apos;s no almighty principle any of this teeters on,<br/>it all just sort of floats back to modular arithmetic and such things.</p><p>Here&apos;s the makings of another theorlet:</p><p>7/12 is 1.955/1200 of an octave flat from 3:2.</p><p>if you cycle the 7/12, the next step as you know is 2/12...</p><p>2/12 is 3.911/1200 of an octave flat from 9:8.</p><p>But also, since:<br/> 7/12 is 1.955/1200 of an octave flat from 3:2, or<br/>14/24 is 1.955/1200 of an octave flat from 3:2, then<br/>14/24 is 3.911/2400 of an octave flat from 3:2.</p><p> 2/12 is 3.911/1200 of an octave flat from 9:8, see, and<br/>14/24 is 3.911/2400 of an octave flat from 3:2.</p><p> 9/12 is 5.867/1200 of an octave flat from 27:16,<br/>21/36 is 5.867/3600 of an octave flat from  3:2.</p><p> 9/12 is 7.822/1200 of an octave flat from 81:64,<br/>28/48 is 7.822/4800 of an octave flat from  3:2.</p><p>So, the number of times you can cycle an interval in a temperament<br/>is proportional to what multiple of that temperament<br/>still uses the same note to represent that interval.  :)<br/>The turning point in the example is a cycle of 25 fifths,<br/>the nearest note to the 26th fifth is slightly closer;<br/>In 300, the same note as 7/12 (175/300) is the nearest note to 3:2,<br/>while in 312, the nearest note to 3:2 is 183, not 182.<br/>At 25x, the numerator (1.955, 3.911 etc) is 48.89,<br/>and at 26x, it&apos;s 50.84.<br/>In more words, it&apos;s more than 50/1200 flat,<br/>that is, it&apos;s more than a quartertone flat,<br/>so the next note higher is actually the more accurate.</p><p>Take something like 19,<br/>if you know that 38, 57, and 76 have the same nearest fifth,<br/>but you know that 95 has a closer one (56/95, not 55)<br/>then you can deduce that the fifth in 19<br/>is only accurate after 4 turns of the cycle<br/>and the fifth one will be off!<br/>(that is, the 18/19 is actually closer to 243:128 than 17/19.)</p><p>The 5:4 in 146 is extremely accurate, at the 47th note.<br/>But since it&apos;s an odd note,<br/>this leaves you with both candidates for the 5:4 in 73<br/>being both almost completely 50/7300 away.<br/>That either candidate is only 8 cents (1200ths) away,<br/>gives you a sort of arbitrary coin toss as to which to use.<br/>In 118, where both 3:2 and 5:4 are scorchingly accurate,<br/>it&apos;s easy enough to visualize 118 as a great 5th limit system.<br/>But in terms of trying to separate behavior by harmonic tendencies,<br/>since the 5:4 is almost 100% ambiguous in 73,<br/>that kind of study might consider 73 more appropriate<br/>for what would be a very 17tET-esque 3rd limit.</p><p>Orph-on-and-off</p></div><h3><a id=23396 href="#23396">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/20/2001 9:24:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; &lt;tuning@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However: (this is what we discovered)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, looking at the 3:2 -<br/>&gt; in 12 the nearest note is  1.955/1200 of an octave flat.<br/>&gt; in 19 the nearest note is 11.430/1900 of an octave flat.<br/>&gt; in 31 the nearest note is 13.385/3100 of an octave flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...and 11.430 + 1.955 = 13.385!</p><p>We&apos;ve discussed that on the list.

I mean post number or whatever,<br/>are they still available?</p><p>&gt;&gt; So, the number of times you can cycle an interval in a temperament<br/>&gt;&gt; is proportional to what multiple of that temperament<br/>&gt;&gt; still uses the same note to represent that interval.  :)</p><p>^-- *this* was the point though.  Just a theorem.<br/>Since you&apos;ve talked about this using the word &quot;degree&quot;,<br/>it&apos;s an interesting way of using the information.<br/>It&apos;s at the very least a mnemonic device<br/>that can cut what you have to retain about temperaments in half.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The turning point in the example is a cycle of 25 fifths,<br/>&gt;&gt; the nearest note to the 26th fifth is slightly closer;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, that&apos;s because 53-tET is essentially just fifths, and 53/2 = 26.5.</p><p>That kind of caught my eye the same way, speaking of mnemonics...<br/>I think because of the sequential numbers and one of them being 26.<br/>I&apos;m glad you saw that the way you did, that&apos;s pretty interesting.</p><p>But...<br/>No, actually it&apos;s because the 1.955% deviation in 12<br/>is almost 1/51 of 100; and 51/2 = 25.5!!!<br/>Which means two things,<br/>that the fifth will wrap 25 times without being more than a quartertone off,<br/>and the fifth will wrap 51 times withough being more than a semitone off.<br/>Which by the above theorem, though, also implies two *more* things:<br/>that the closest fifth in 25*12 (300) will be 25*7,<br/>and the closest fifth in 26*12 (312) will *not* be 26*7. :)</p><p>Or actually it&apos;s because 12*26 is the first *multiple* of 12<br/>that has a more accurate fifth than 12.<br/>&quot;Which is... oh yeah... 612.&quot;  :)<br/>I&apos;d forgotten.  And yes, 306 is up there.</p><p>So make it 5 things?  No actually.</p><p>Because &quot;actually&quot;, there isn&apos;t any specific &quot;because&quot; here,<br/>like I was saying, it doesn&apos;t all go back to any one math principle.<br/>It&apos;s just sort of an implied set of ways of looking at something,<br/>a group of facts that are all corollaries of each other.<br/>that float around commutativity like a molecule.<br/>Big digression, I know, I just don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a name for it.</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>This is what I mean about numerology can&apos;t be monolithic!<br/>I hate when numbers get close like this.<br/>In my earlier days, when I first wondered what 31 + 34 was,<br/>I came up with 67 and it messed up my work for 8 months.</p><p>But since you brought up ol&apos; 53...!<br/>Since the fifth in 53 is .003039 of a &quot;degree&quot; flat,<br/>.5 / .003039 = 164.527805<br/>So:<br/>the fifth in 53 can wrap around 164 times before being misrepresented,<br/>the closest fifth in 329*53 is 329*31,<br/>the closest fifth in 330*53 is not 330*31.<br/>10231/17490 is a little more accurate than 10230/17490.</p><p>&gt;&gt; then you can deduce that the fifth in 19<br/>&gt;&gt; is only accurate after 4 turns of the cycle<br/>&gt;&gt; and the fifth one will be off!<br/>&gt;&gt; (that is, the 18/19 is actually closer to 243:128 than 17/19.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The way I see it, we never hear 243:128 directly, but only as a construction<br/>&gt; by fifths and<br/>&gt; possibly 9:8s . . . so functionally, 243:128 is always 17 degrees of 19-tET.<br/>&gt; But that&apos;s a very<br/>&gt; interesting point when directly comparing the melodic distances of Pythagorean<br/>&gt; and 19-tET.</p><p>Since 19 isn&apos;t as accurate,<br/>I was using this to illustrate that the way 4 turns falls too flat,<br/>with 4 as the threshold,<br/>that while 19, 38, 57, and 76 share the same closest 5th,<br/>95 has one that&apos;s closer.</p><p>...that the number of possible turns of an interval in a temperament<br/>is the same of the multiple of that temperament that can handle *one* turn.</p><p>Why do I feel like a new list is going to start soon...</p></div><h3><a id=23442 href="#23442">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/21/2001 10:51:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Orphon Soul, Inc.&quot; &lt;tuning@o...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; But since you brought up ol&apos; 53...!<br/>&gt; Since the fifth in 53 is .003039 of a &quot;degree&quot; flat,<br/>&gt; .5 / .003039 = 164.527805<br/>&gt; So:<br/>&gt; the fifth in 53 can wrap around 164 times before being<br/>misrepresented,</p><p>Isn&apos;t it 165?
