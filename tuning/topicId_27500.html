You *could* mount a<br/>zeroth fret right on an interchangeable fretboard like<br/>the the rest of the frets, but wouldn&apos;t it, like a<br/>traditional nut, need slots in it to keep the<br/>individual strings from slipping sideways during the<br/>bending of strings?</p><p>  And wouldn&apos;t it be unnecessarily tedious to have to<br/>detune and then retune all the strings each time you<br/>went to change fretboards?</p><p>  Common sense would seem to answer that having the<br/>zeroth fret or nut mounted right on the<br/>interchangeable fretboard makes little sense, so<br/>something else must be driving your query, something I<br/>have obviously missed.
