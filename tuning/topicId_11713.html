To me, it&apos;s so much hoo hah. After<br/>&gt;looking up the two terms in various dictionaries at work, some music,<br/>&gt;some not, I have come to the conclusion that they are essentially two<br/>&gt;senses of the same term, therefore I can&apos;t say that I agree with Paul<br/>&gt;Erlich on his distinction (or Blackwood, though I have yet to read<br/>&gt;his book cover-to-cover). If we&apos;re going to make such a distinction,<br/>&gt;then it seems to me that we also have to come up with a term that<br/>&gt;will separate mathematical consonance from subjective consonance. A<br/>&gt;4:5:6:7 chord is mathematically consonant, since each interval within<br/>&gt;it exists in symetry with the others, with difference tones that are<br/>&gt;octave transpositions of tones already present in the chord. A<br/>&gt;4:5:6:7 could sound dissonant is if it was voiced too low, in which<br/>&gt;case the difference tones could be low enough to be perceived as<br/>&gt;beats instead of logical bass tones, but it would still be<br/>&gt;mathematically consonant. On the other hand, there seem to be those<br/>&gt;who say that tunings other than just are consonant (or is it<br/>&gt;concordant?). Interesting. I see no mathematical basis for this<br/>&gt;viewpoint. Maybe I&apos;ve misinterpreted? Of course there are plenty of<br/>&gt;&quot;dissonant&quot; constructs that sound great, but they&apos;re still dissonant.<br/>&gt;As a player, my ears tell me what is consonant, and they usually<br/>&gt;agree with the mathematical model.</p><p>Patrick, some aspects of music psychology are more amenable to mathematical<br/>modeling than others, and some have been explained my so many contrasting<br/>mathematical models that they can&apos;t all be right. Anyway, Patrick, I think<br/>you have misinterpreted somewhat, in that, while I claim the dominant<br/>seventh chord is dissonant within the language of Western common practice,<br/>i.e., triadic diatonic music (even when the chord is tuned 4:5:6:7), I claim<br/>that the chord can be used as a consonance in other styles (and this is all<br/>based on my personal musical experience, not conjectures on paper). I<br/>suggest you read my paper (<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>)<br/>where I give a mathematical enough (I hope) explanation of how consonance<br/>works in a tonal system, both our familiar one, and a proposed new one which<br/>would use 7-limit tetrads as the basic harmonies. Essentially, one must<br/>remember a chord in music is not an isolated entity, but is generally built<br/>from whatever scale the melody is built from (in contrapuntal music, this is<br/>unavoidable), and it is the combination of concordance and scalar properties<br/>of the chord that gives it its musical meaning and direction. As Toch points<br/>out, even a perfect octave can function as a dissonance if it is foreign to<br/>the prevailing scale of the moment.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ll grant that tuners of fixed pitch instruments have had to go to<br/>&gt;great mathematical lengths to find workable tunings for these<br/>&gt;instruments to play in more than one key, but players of variable<br/>&gt;pitched instruments and vocalists have always been free of such<br/>&gt;constraints (unless we have to play with keyboards!). Remember, the<br/>&gt;keyboard tuners and theoreticians were the ones who wrote down what<br/>&gt;they did. No one else thought to do that, or needed to, for that<br/>&gt;matter. Good, simple, garden variety intonation just _is_.</p><p>I&apos;d say the players of variable pitch instruments and vocalists have had to,<br/>generally by ear and without the aid of any mathematics, solve a much more<br/>difficult problem than that solved by keyboard tuners and the vast majority<br/>of historical theoreticians. Namely, they&apos;ve had to come up with some<br/>adaptive tuning scheme, like the ones John deLaubenfels&apos;s computer program<br/>solve. Since &quot;adaptive tuning&quot; was the subject line of your message, I<br/>presume you have some idea of what I&apos;m talking about?</p><p>&gt;Time to digress: Having said all this about how just intervals are so<br/>&gt;cool, I have to admit that there are instances where 12tET or other<br/>&gt;tunings do sound good. I am a jazz player too, and there are many<br/>&gt;jazz chords that don&apos;t work well in the just scale, 7-limit or not.<br/>&gt;In fact, 12tET has spawned harmonic extensions that sound really cool<br/>&gt;in 12tET, but not so good when tuned to just intervals. As if such a<br/>&gt;thing could even be done with some chords. Try tuning the beats out<br/>&gt;of a G13#11! But it sounds very nice in 12tET.</p><p>I&apos;ve made those points before -- another example being a 6/9 chord, which<br/>sounds best in meantone, OK in 12-tET, and not too hot in JI.</p></div><h3><a id=11728 href="#11728">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2000 1:51:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul H.

I Just wanted to pass on a<br/>&gt;brief point that I once came across (and that I&apos;ve already posted to<br/>&gt;the list before regarding this; especially in the context of the<br/>&gt;tuning of the dominant seventh chord)... I remember reading in Joseph<br/>&gt;Yasser&apos;s 1930s &quot;A Theory of Evolving Tonality,&quot; a bit where he<br/>&gt;specifically mentions that the a cappella music of the Russian<br/>&gt;church -- free from the influence of equal temperament -- avoids the<br/>&gt;4:5:6:7 dominant seventh... that the seven tone diatonic scale itself<br/>&gt;(so constructed), &apos;necessitates&apos; a more &apos;tense&apos; intonation... and that<br/>&gt;the overall context (i.e., the need to establish resolution here),<br/>&gt;even in this variable pitch, a cappella context, overrides whatever<br/>&gt;the most aurally expedient isolated tuning of this chord itself might<br/>&gt;be... While I can&apos;t pretend to vouch for the accuracy of the account,<br/>&gt;I thought I&apos;d pass it on as I found it interesting in the context of<br/>&gt;this discussion.</p><p>I&apos;d like to join you in welcoming Patrick to the list, and would like to<br/>vouch for your comments. Though one clearly hears 4:5:6:7 chords in<br/>Barbershop music, music such as that of the Bulgarian Women&apos;s Choir has a<br/>very different aesthetic, and often sounds to me like it uses minor sevenths<br/>that result from stacking a 6:5 minor third on top of a 3:2 perfect fifth .<br/>. . and I heartily agree with the assessment you/Yasser make above,<br/>notwithstading my feelings about Yasser&apos;s other ideas . . . and I&apos;m sure<br/>Margo would agree too and might be able to offer some augmentative remarks .<br/>. .</p></div>
