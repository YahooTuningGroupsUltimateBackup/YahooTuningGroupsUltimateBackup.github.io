Surely, the bassoon could be no more difficult in this regard. Suffice it to say, I am at least partially informed. I shall not regale you with my saga of trombone blowing experience either.</p><p>  But I try: firstly, an embouchure, or mouth-muscle development is obtained under a master&rsquo;s direction.

My lungs would surely fail me.</p><p>  Playing by cent on bassoon is like singing by cent is like playing Theremin by cent.  Unless one has experience with such instruments and has spent years gaining performance experience, it would be difficult to judge, though.  I measure pitch real time while playing.

Perhaps it was always so.</p><p>I will take this to mean that the beauty of your musical performance, as well as many other performances by others, depends on purposefully deviating from the course of a given fixed tuning when it is agreeable to do so.</p><p>  Ozan:  At the same time, it would not hurt to be doubly sure that (given the tautology of the procedure you described below) you indeed can sing &quot;cents&quot; and not just any other interval you fancy as a &quot;cent&quot;; which of course would say nothing about how such a demonstration reflects instrumental practice during the flow of music.</p><p>  Johnny:  Please check past posts.
