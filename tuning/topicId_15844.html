I&apos;m planning to buy a laptop. My options are a new wintel PIII 700, 128 ram with a fast u-dma 66 hard disk and sound blaster pro compatible in-built audio hardware or a good second hand powerbook g3. I need to use it with a realt time soft (microtonal) sampler and synth - as gigasampler. In the next future I&apos;d like also to use also Csound. I think i will need also to expand it with a midi interface via USB or PCMCIA...<br/>What it the best solution? and first of all, in your experience, could a soft sampler run in *real* real- time in a laptop?<br/>thank you in advance!<br/>silvio</p></div><h3><a id=15848 href="#15848">ðŸ”—</a>M.

A WAV file is roughly 10 MBytes per minute (16<br/>bits, 44.1K samples per second, 2 channels), so you will definitely want a<br/>CD-R or CD-RW.</p><p>However, if you&apos;re interested in *real-time* performance, it is best to<br/>think of your computer as a *control-rate* device and generate the actual<br/>audio with some off-board DSP equipment. In other words, use a cheaper<br/>computer and save some money for a better synthesizer than what comes in a<br/>computer sound card. No matter how fast your main CPU is, I think you&apos;ll be<br/>disappointed with the kinds of sound you can generate with algorithms that<br/>run in real time, and you&apos;ll also find that the operating system, especially<br/>Windows, uses a lot of resources.</p><p>As to PC/Windows vs. MAC/MacOS vs. Linux, that will depend on what software<br/>you want to run. CSound is available for all three. There are quite a few<br/>packages that are available only for the MAC/MacOS, which I think is a real<br/>pity. I have a Toshiba Satellite 2595 CDT (400 MHz Celeron, 192 MB RAM, 6 GB<br/>disk space and a Sony Spressa CD-RW) which is fine, as I noted above, for<br/>off-line audio work -- a digital sound studio -- but I have augmented that<br/>with a Yamaha VL70-m (monophonic) synthesizer which uses advanced physical<br/>modelling techniques. I could have probably gone with a DSP chip evaluation<br/>module and saved some money, but I also bought the Yamaha WX5 woodwind<br/>controller to use as a MIDI source (I&apos;m a flute player) and the combination<br/>seemed very natural and saves me months of programming.</p><p>If I were starting from scratch, buying a new machine solely for e-music, I<br/>would get an Intel desktop rather than a laptop, mostly because the hard<br/>disks are bigger and cheaper and you have actual slots for actual audio<br/>equipment rather than just serial, parallel and USB ports. And I would most<br/>likely run Linux rather than Windows because it has a lot less overhead. But<br/>I still wouldn&apos;t count on it as a real-time DSP engine.<br/>--<br/>M.
