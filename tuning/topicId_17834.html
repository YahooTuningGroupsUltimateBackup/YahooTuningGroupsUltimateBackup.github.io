[...]</p><p>&gt; things get a bit difficult to discern  when the beating becomes too slow to<br/>register.</p><p>Paul answers:<br/>&gt;&gt;When the beating becomes too slow to register, you&apos;ve _acheived_ JI in my<br/>book  This is the kind of JI I was referring to; if you&apos;re using a different<br/>definition of JI, yes, then JI can be &quot;just&quot; as hard to tune as anything.&lt;&lt;</p><p> Hmmm  I define JI music as music that has as its characteristic the sound of<br/>untempered intervals.  However, that doesn&apos;t quite address the question, I<br/>think.<br/>If an interval is simply beating too slow to produce recognizable beats, it<br/>may be narrow or wide from Just and the tuner will not know it.  By itself,<br/>this interval may do its job, but when you have an multiple intervals, is<br/>there not some cumulative error that is allowed by such a lack of precision?<br/>If not, then end of story, but if so, then a JI tuning is going to contain<br/>some drift, no?<br/>    It may be ironic,that if I want a perfectly(within reason) Just interval<br/>on a piano, I have to apply a test note, with which each of the Just<br/>interval&apos;s notes are played , and then comparing beat rates between the two<br/>test intervals.<br/>     Just how Just does Just mean?<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>(just sitting around in Gnashville)</p></div><h3><a id=17875 href="#17875">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I really don&apos;t want to go into that<br/>again. Anyhow, I was referring to timbres with perfect harmonic partials,<br/>like the human voice, bowed strings, brass, and reed instruments -- not the<br/>piano. So I believe I&apos;ve made the point I was trying to make, and don&apos;t wish<br/>to pursue this further, knowing the infinite regress that awaits . . .</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
