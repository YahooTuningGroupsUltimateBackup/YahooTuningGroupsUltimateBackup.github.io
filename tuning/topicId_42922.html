However, here at<br/>last it is.</p><p>If m=5^(1/4) is the meantone fifth, then we can make a circle of fifths<br/>by [m, m, m, m, m, m, m, 56/55*m, m, m, m, 176/175*m] and another by<br/>[m, m, m, m, m, m, m, 176/175*m, m, m, m, 56/55*m]. The major thirds<br/>corresponding to the first circle are [5/4, 5/4, 5/4, 5/4, 14/11,<br/>14/11, 14/11, 14/11, 44/35, 44/35, 44/35, 44/35] and to the second<br/>circle are [5/4, 5/4, 5/4, 5/4, 44/35, 44/35, 44/35, 44/35, 14/11,<br/>14/11, 14/11, 14/11]. If we follow Robert&apos;s principles, the second<br/>version would be preferred, as we have four pure thirds followed by<br/>four 396 cent thirds; the last of which goes with a sharp fifth<br/>5^(1/4) 176/175 of 706.44 cents.</p></div>
