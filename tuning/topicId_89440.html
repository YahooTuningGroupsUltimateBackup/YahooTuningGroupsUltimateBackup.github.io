It&apos;s a comma-splitting temperament.  It would therefore deal in IRRATIONAL numbers (the twelfth root of the Pythagorean Comma), if any numbers were actually needed in the process of setting this up.  They&apos;re not.  Just a simple listening process and MUSICAL skills, knowing what to listen for, and how to compare the qualities of intervals until they&apos;re &quot;the same&quot; as one another.</p><p>Take a closer look.  My instructions say that they are &quot;Practical temperament instructions by ear&quot;.  That they are.  By ear, to the best accuracy that anyone can reasonably hope for when working directly at a real harpsichord.  The recipe is not a pretext for calculations.  It is a straightforward set of practical instructions to do a physical task, to reasonably deliverable accuracy.  I take the two-decimal accuracy of the beat rates from that snapshot (and two decimals are more than enough for anybody, already!)...and I round all of them off to a single decimal, for the by-ear instructions.  Have you got that point?  That&apos;s why the instructions say &quot;3 beats per second&quot; for the F-A (it&apos;s rounded off to 3.0 from 2.98), and &quot;4.5 per second&quot; for C-E (it&apos;s rounded off from 4.46).</p><p>1/10th of a beat per second, in the middle octaves of a keyboard, listening to 5ths and 3rds?  That&apos;s plenty, in a task that takes only two to three minutes (setting the temperament bearings for all twelve pitch-classes), working by ear and having the necessary physical skills of adjusting tuning pins with the right tools.  1/100th of a beat per second would be ludicrous, and that&apos;s why I round off my instructions to 1/10th, which itself is overkill.</p><p>To be able to say that I&apos;m allegedly wrong, here below you&apos;ve produced 12-digit and 14-digit decimals.  Come on!  In trying to demonstrate that my practical instructions are somehow faulty, you have only demonstrated that you aren&apos;t reading them properly, and that you are not even approaching them within the medium for which they&apos;re intended.</p><p>Because you can&apos;t deal with the rounding-off of two decimal places to one, in interpreting my instructions at the very few places where they mention beat rates as specific constants, you misinterpret everything else from there forward.  You come up with three differently-sized 5ths in F-C, G-D, and A-E, even though I have clearly stated that they are to be geometrically identical: with 1/6 PC of tempering, each.</p><p>You also take the F-A to be a rational distance, 877/1100, which is (as I noted above) impossible.  To get it right, IF CALCULATION WERE EVEN IMPORTANT, you&apos;d have to do your calculations from irrational numbers...and you&apos;re obviously not prepared to do that with your spreadsheet.  Your input of the temperament is a set of integers, making ratios.  There is no way that that approach is ever going to hit the spot, in assessing a temperament (or a set of instructions) based on comma-splitting.</p><p>More importantly: to follow my instructions &quot;to the letter&quot;, as you are evidently fond of saying, you&apos;d have to be sitting there actually tuning a harpsichord by ear, not playing with spreadsheets and producing 14-digit decimals.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello Bradley, in between the lines:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (And I&apos;m forwarding this to the tuning list for its relevance to the<br/>&gt; whole issue of your recipe of Lehman-Bach Temperament versus my recipe<br/>&gt; for UWT nr.3)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &acirc;Âœ&copy; &acirc;Âœ&copy; &acirc;Âœ&copy;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On May 22, 2010, at 12:45 AM, Brad Lehman wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Oz,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Among other problems, you&apos;re profoundly misreading my instructions<br/>&gt; &gt; vis-a-vis what the word &quot;same&quot; means.

Because I see that you have no intention of yielding to the<br/>facts:</p><p>1. The recipe that you gave as the course to follow &quot;for an<br/>experienced harpsichord tuner to set up an entire harpsichord in 15<br/>minutes to your tuning&quot;, DOES NOT produce the temperament which you<br/>claim to set by ear using fifths tempered by GEOMETRIC FRACTIONS of a<br/>rational interval. Every interval save G is skewed 3 to 3.6 cents down<br/>from your values (even taking into consideration your protestations<br/>against my formulations). On the one hand, you are being extremely<br/>liberal in setting up your temperament, on the other, you throw about<br/>criticisms against my UWT major thirds and fifths which differ from<br/>yours by even smaller increments (that is, if you actually follow the<br/>recipe right and cross-check by a tuning device for human errors).</p><p>2. The feature that you boast for your temperament being absent in<br/>mine, that is, the regularity of fifth temperings, does not arise from<br/>your recipe. Where does it come from? It comes from your Excel<br/>spreadsheet and the Scala file. How can anyone tune irrational<br/>integers exactly the same size by ear? By following your recipe. Maybe<br/>you possess an extra-ordinary capacity to disregard the recipe and<br/>tune everything right to the nth decimal, I don&apos;t know. But is your<br/>Excel number-crunching of the irrational figures of a 1/6 comma Well-<br/>Temperament to take precedence over another Excel number crunching<br/>that yields a balanced, ear-tunable Well-Temperament with proportional<br/>beat rates that can be set up EXACTLY according to my instructions?</p><p>3. You OBVIOUSLY listen to, count and compare beats just the same in<br/>your recipe when setting up your temperament &quot;in 15 minutes&quot; compared<br/>to my recipe for UWT nr.3 (where the second is the unit time or not).<br/>That there is nothing to suggest your approach is analog versus myalleged &quot;digital&quot;. That if my approach has CONSTANTS, then your<br/>approach are not BEREFT of them.</p><p>&gt; For one thing, it&apos;s wrong to copy somebody&apos;s private e-mail onto a<br/>&gt; discussion list, and hack it apart in response.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I saw no harm in doing so, for the messages contained nothing<br/>&quot;private&quot; as I could tell. The technical relevance of the contents to<br/>the matter at hand took precedence in my view. Sorry if I caused you<br/>any alarm.</p><p>&gt; For another, you&apos;ve cited here the snapshot that gives all the<br/>&gt; CORRECT cent values and A=440 beat rates of my temperament, to 2<br/>&gt; decimal places:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/bach-beats-440.gif">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/bach-beats-440.gif</a><br/>&gt; ...but, you&apos;ve disregarded it, and have chosen instead to go with<br/>&gt; your own calculations that arise from one mistaken assumption after<br/>&gt; another.<br/>&gt;</p><p>My dear colleague. I have done no mistaken assumptions. I have taken<br/>your recipe to tune the harpsichord in 15 minutes at face value. If<br/>those instructions mean anything and have any relevance to your<br/>temperament, as you clearly insinuate is the case, then what argument<br/>can you have against the results that show such gross deviations in<br/>the cycle and intended pitches? It&apos;s either:</p><p>1. You are not correctly describing what you are doing, or,<br/>2. You are not adhering to what you describe, or, in the remotest<br/>possibility (yet!),<br/>3. I have made some truly terrible error that affects the results up<br/>to the point that your recipe yields your temperament to the nth<br/>remainder for every irrational number you hold dear.</p><p>&gt; That table of mine is to compare against the set of my instructions<br/>&gt; here:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/practical.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/practical.html</a><br/>&gt; You are reverse-engineering those instructions into a spreadsheet of<br/>&gt; your own, USING RATIOS that mis-represent the nature of this<br/>&gt; temperament (and the nature of the instructions).  It&apos;s a comma-<br/>&gt; splitting temperament.  It would therefore deal in IRRATIONAL<br/>&gt; numbers (the twelfth root of the Pythagorean Comma), if any numbers<br/>&gt; were actually needed in the process of setting this up.  They&apos;re<br/>&gt; not.

It is mighty clear that you either tolerate a 694.5 cent<br/>fifth in your tuning while bombarding me for having specified a 695<br/>cent fifth in E-B and F-C (where they are supposed to be tuned 698.5<br/>and 700 cents respectively), or do not follow the instructions.</p><p>Being compromised in such a fashion, you cannot throw about criticisms<br/>against UWT nr.3, most of which are demonstrably baseless.</p><p>&gt; Take a closer look.  My instructions say that they are &quot;Practical<br/>&gt; temperament instructions by ear&quot;.  That they are.  By ear, to the<br/>&gt; best accuracy that anyone can reasonably hope for when working<br/>&gt; directly at a real harpsichord.</p><p>3.5 cents error on every tone except G? And you still claim the<br/>superiority of regular sized geometrically tempered fifths?</p><p>The discrepancy between your claims and the reality are enormously<br/>glaring my dear colleague.</p><p>And I&apos;m sure, if you work at the numbers a bit more, you can arrive at<br/>even closer approximations to the desired numbers in your Excel<br/>worksheet.</p><p>&gt; The recipe is not a pretext for calculations.  It is a<br/>&gt; straightforward set of practical instructions to do a physical task,<br/>&gt; to reasonably deliverable accuracy.</p><p>Well!</p><p>&gt;  I take the two-decimal accuracy of the beat rates from that<br/>&gt; snapshot (and two decimals are more than enough for anybody,<br/>&gt; already!)...and I round all of them off to a single decimal, for the<br/>&gt; by-ear instructions.  Have you got that point?  That&apos;s why the<br/>&gt; instructions say &quot;3 beats per second&quot; for the F-A (it&apos;s rounded off<br/>&gt; to 3.0 from 2.98), and &quot;4.5 per second&quot; for C-E (it&apos;s rounded off<br/>&gt; from 4.46).</p><p>All of which end up yielding a 694.5 cent fifth right there between F-<br/>C. How you get rid of that fifth which is arrived at by methods that<br/>are &quot;enough for anybody&quot;, I don&apos;t know.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/10th of a beat per second, in the middle octaves of a keyboard,&gt; listening to 5ths and 3rds?  That&apos;s plenty, in a task that takes<br/>&gt; only two to three minutes (setting the temperament bearings for all<br/>&gt; twelve pitch-classes), working by ear and having the necessary<br/>&gt; physical skills of adjusting tuning pins with the right tools.<br/>&gt; 1/100th of a beat per second would be ludicrous, and that&apos;s why I<br/>&gt; round off my instructions to 1/10th, which itself is overkill.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Overkill enough for 3 to 3.6 skew on every pitch except G and that<br/>monsterous 694.5 cent fifth?</p><p>Well!</p><p>&gt; To be able to say that I&apos;m allegedly wrong,</p><p>Oh believe me, there is nothing allegedly wrong about the end result<br/>of your tuning instructions which you just admitted above is: &quot;the<br/>best accuracy that anyone can reasonably hope for when working<br/>directly at a real harpsichord&quot;.</p><p>&gt; here below you&apos;ve produced 12-digit and 14-digit decimals.

Your instructions do not result in the tuning you say<br/>it does my colleague. Please take a step back and consider your<br/>position here.</p><p>&gt; Because you can&apos;t deal with the rounding-off of two decimal places<br/>&gt; to one, in interpreting my instructions at the very few places where<br/>&gt; they mention beat rates as specific constants, you misinterpret&gt; everything else from there forward.</p><p>Me? Me the one misinterpreting your instructions? I followed them just<br/>as you described them. Them being, in your own words, &quot;the best<br/>accuracy that anyone can reasonably hope for when working directly at<br/>a real harpsichord&quot;.</p><p>If you have a recipe that helps you set it up RIGHTLY this time,<br/>please share it with us.</p><p>&gt;  You come up with three differently-sized 5ths in F-C, G-D, and A-E,<br/>&gt; even though I have clearly stated that they are to be geometrically<br/>&gt; identical: with 1/6 PC of tempering, each.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes yes yes, you always state the reality of the figures of your Excel<br/>worksheet.

I still can&apos;t see all the processes you did, because you didn&apos;t show them, but here&apos;s how I would do it:</p><p>Temporary C a pure 4th below that F: 877/1100 x 3/4 = 2631/4400</p><p>Temporary D a pure 5th below the A: 2/3</p><p>Next step is to find the G that&apos;s a 4th above that D, and a 5th above that C, such that it&apos;s at the GEOMETRIC mean, and such that the D-G 4th beats triplets against the C-G 5th&apos;s duplets.</p><p>The pure G from that D would be 2/3 x 4/3 = 8/9</p><p>The pure G from that C would be 2631/4400 x 3/2 = 7893/8800</p><p>The mean spot between those two phantom G candidates, geometrically, is sqrt(8/9 x 7893/8800) = .8929012976+</p><p>That&apos;s the G we get by following my instructions, tuning by ear and seeking the spot where we get triplets beating against duplets from the two temporary notes.</p><p>The G *you* got (somehow??) was &quot;1961/1100&quot;, which when adjusted to the proper octave at 1961/2200 is .8913636363+</p><p>Your notes don&apos;t say anything about moving the C (per my instructions) to a proper spot, after using the temporary one.  Again, I can&apos;t see how you derived C in its final position with your ratios, but clearly you&apos;ve ended up with C at a wrong spot vis-a-vis A.  Yours is at 302.27 cents, and it ought to be 305.87; you&apos;re off by more than 3 cents!</p><p>From your wrong G, you somehow came up with a D that you say is &quot;calculated to be 78440000000000/58716923076923&quot;.  I can&apos;t follow any of your arithmetic here, because you didn&apos;t show it, but clearly you&apos;re already accumulating so many errors recursively that it&apos;s pointless to continue.  Your D ends up at 501.3758 cents from A, somehow, while it ought to be at 501.96.  That&apos;s not as bad as the errors in the C and the G, but anyway, it&apos;s off.  They&apos;re all off.  Somehow, you accidentally found ways to diverge from the instructions, while trying to test those instructions.</p><p>More importantly, I can&apos;t see that you have used square roots anywhere, which is the proper procedure to place a note at a mean point relative to two other notes.  Without square roots, and therefore some irrational numbers occasionally, you&apos;re not going to get there.</p><p>My &quot;triplets against duplets&quot; beating procedure, comparing successive 5ths, works whenever we&apos;re making 5ths the same size GEOMETRICALLY.  All the 5ths have some constant amount taken off them (which happens to be a fraction of the PC in mine, but it could be any constant), and the frequencies of both notes are 3/2 higher each time we move up(**), so the beat rates also increase as 3/2, &quot;triplets against duplets&quot;.  If we are looking at (for example) the open-string notes of violins and violas, and we have regularly tempered 5ths everywhere, and the A-E is beating 3/sec, the D-A will be 2/sec, the G-D is 4/3 per sec, and the C-G is 8/9 per sec.</p><p>(**) &quot;3/2 higher&quot; shortened by some small tempered amount, but close enough to 3/2 for all practical purposes on acoustic instruments, when making this comparison....</p><p>To calculate all those notes with their REGULAR GEOMETRIC tempering, if they actually have to be calculated (as opposed to tuning them directly by ear, which is much simpler!), we have to use square roots....not ratios.</p><p>The MUSICAL skill here, as opposed to the mathematical skill, is to recognize all those identically-tempered 5ths by their quality, directly: not having to count the beats that prove they&apos;re spot-on.  With practice (and I&apos;ve had 27 years of doing this), it&apos;s easy to get two neighboring 5ths set up with similar quality, without any conscious counting of beats.  And so, as I said several days ago, that&apos;s how I tune: and that&apos;s how I write tuning instructions for readers who have that similarly practiced musical skill.  That &quot;triplets against duplets&quot; check is a useful test for the similarity of the intervals, but the similarity is already directly perceptible (close enough) without it.</p><p>People who prefer mathematically-based instructions based on beat-counting are free to formulate their own sequence of setting the notes.

The data show that, if you rely on that recipe of yours, you<br/>WILL NOT get the temperament you hold dear to your heart my colleague.</p><p>Let us remember the whole purpose of my delving into this dialague<br/>with you here. You formulated a bunch of protestations against UWT nr.<br/>3 to nullify the proportional beat ratios feature and forward the<br/>presumptive precedence of your Bach Temperament or some other no-<br/>brainer temperament above it based on what proved to be spurious<br/>illations.</p><p>Before we come to all that, let me shed light on my calculations on<br/>your recipe step by step:</p><p>1. Tune tenor A to 220 Hz. Ok, no-brainer.</p><p>2. Tenor F down from this A beating thrice per second, a wide major<br/>third.</p><p>&#x9;(220 * 4 - 3) / 5 = 175.4 Hz for tenor F.</p><p>&#x9;yielding exactly the interval 1100/877 at 392.226 cents</p><p>3. Temporary tenor C a pure fourth down therefrom. No-brainer:</p><p>&#x9;(175.4 * (3/4)) = 131.55 Hz for tenor C. Ratio from A 1/1 is 2631/2200.</p><p>4. Temporary tenor D a pure fifth down from tenor A. No-brainer again:</p><p>&#x9;(220 * 2/3) = 146 2/3 Hz for tenor D. Ratio from A 1/1 is 4/3.</p><p>5. Tenor G will be acquired in such a fashion that D-G will beat 1.5<br/>times as fast as C-G as you say. Tricky math, but easy with the formula:</p><p>&#x9;1.5 * (3x - 4D) = -(2x - 3C)</p><p>&#x9;1.5 * (3x - (4*(146+(2/3)))) = -(2x - (3*131.55))</p><p>&#x9;1.5 * (3x - (1760/3)) = 394.65 - 2x</p><p>&#x9;Variable x is calculated as 196.1 Hz for G.</p><p>&#x9;1.63333333333333 beats per second D-G VS -2.45 beats per second C-G.<br/>Exactly 3/2 times absolutely.</p><p>&#x9;And, surprise surprise, what do we find as the ratio? Why, that makes<br/>a 1961/1100 from 1/1 A, the ratio for G you wondered where was comingfrom.</p><p>6. Middle C as the result of G-C beating 1.5 times as fast as F-C as<br/>aforetime:</p><p>&#x9;1.5 * (3x - 4G) = -(2x - 3F)</p><p>&#x9;1.5 * (3x - (4*196.1)) = -(2x - (3*175.4))</p><p>&#x9;1.5 * (3x - 784.4) = 526.2 - 2x</p><p>&#x9;Variable x is calculated as 261.9692307692308 Hz for C.</p><p>&#x9;1.5076923076924 beats per second G-C VS -2.2615384615384 beats per<br/>second F-C. Exactly 3/2 times absolutely.</p><p>&#x9;And, what do we get? Why, could it be middle C at its proper spot<br/>with the ratio 877/550 * 2619692307692308/3508000000000000 =<br/>654923076923077/550000000000000 from A 1/1? Which is simplified to<br/>256860830769231/215710000000000 (302.273 cents) with the sole<br/>difference being the raising of the last digit in the last decimal of<br/>the relative frequency by 1? (1.190769230769231 VERSUS<br/>1.190769230769232)</p><p>&#x9;Figures.</p><p>7. Next order of business, finding D in the same fashion from G and A.<br/>Again our number-cruncher equation:</p><p>&#x9;1.5 * (3x - 4A) = -(2x - 3G)</p><p>&#x9;1.5 * (3x - (4*220)) = -(2x - (3*196.1))</p><p>&#x9;1.5 * (3x - 880) = 588.3 - 2x</p><p>&#x9;Variable x is calculated as 293.5846153846154 Hz for D.</p><p>&#x9;0.7538461538462 beats per second A-D VS -1.1307692307692 beats per<br/>second G-D, once more exactly 3/2 times absolutely.</p><p>&#x9;The ratio of D being 1961/1100 * 2935846153846154/3922000000000000 =<br/>1467923076923077/1100000000000000 from A 1/1, yielding 499.53 cents.<br/>Ok, I admit I made the horrible mistake of 1.8 cents by saying it was78440000000000/58716923076923 that yields 501.37580. A slip from<br/>losing my sanity after all that number-crunching. Even worse for you,<br/>because the previous value was almost identical with your calculated<br/>interval on paper. So, the 700.5 cent fifth moved from G-D to D-A in<br/>the cycle. &quot;Big fat hairy deal&quot;. You still don&apos;t get a 1/6 PC tempered<br/>fifth where you seek.</p><p>8. The most complicated part comes now. Complicated because it&apos;s<br/>impossible to ascertain what piece of information to rely on to set<br/>the &quot;golden mean&quot; (another monicker for brats you shun?) for WTC 1 C<br/>Major Prelude, since taking one refutes the other. We want E to be<br/>lowered so that A-E becomes the &quot;same quality&quot; as the previous fifths<br/>we worked out so far. What to do, what to do? You specifically<br/>instruct us that C-E is to beat 4.5 times per second wide. What do we<br/>get?</p><p>&#x9;(261.9692307692308 x 5 + 4.5) / 4 = 328.5865384615385 Hz for tenor E.</p><p>&#x9;What of the A-E fifth? Ay Ay ay, 694.524 cents. Surely that can&apos;t be<br/>right.</p><p>&#x9;Let&apos;s then take the other path: A-E fifth beating exactly 1/2 that of<br/>F-A, sharing the same A. Easy as pie. That means 1.5 times per second.<br/>Hence the formula:</p><p>&#x9;2x - 660 = 1.5</p><p>&#x9;x = 330.75 Hz.</p><p>&#x9;Ah, an even worse A-E fifth at 705.885 cents. No can do!</p><p>&#x9;Let&apos;s try another path: You say A-E beats 1.5 times the D-A fifth in<br/>the tenor. Hence the equation:</p><p>&#x9;(2x - (220 * 3)) = 1.5*((220*2) - (146.7923076923077 * 3))</p><p>&#x9;= 329.7173076923077 Hz.</p><p>&#x9;Close, but no cigar. 700.471 cents between A-E this time.</p><p>&#x9;Let&apos;s try this: C-E 1.5 times the beat of F-A in the tenor.</p><p>&#x9;(4x - (261.9692307692308 * 5)) = 4.5</p><p>&#x9;Yielding 328.5865384615385 Hz, and a glaring 694.5 cent fifth again!</p><p>&#x9;Nothing works, so I have to figure out how to comply with this demand<br/>of yours: &quot;fuss with both these E&apos;s until all four of the following<br/>points are true&quot;, a task, which is impossible from where we stand. Not<br/>even taking 1100/877 over to C in compliance with &quot;These two major<br/>thirds (F-A, C-E) should have exactly the same character as one<br/>another, although the beat rate is different&quot; solves the 694.5 cent<br/>narrow fifth problem on A-E. All that remains is trying to keep A-E<br/>&quot;same quality as these other fifths&quot;, D-A, F-C, G-D. The best I can<br/>do, is to keep A-E the same size as G-D and C-G. I chose -1.5 beats<br/>per second for the job. Criticize me all you like! The fifth size in<br/>the end is what you desire: 698.016 cents versus your 698.045 cents.<br/>Thus the ratio for E becomes 1317/880 (You ought to thank me for<br/>saving your neck right at this step!).</p><p>9. Tuning all fifths pure from E up to C# and from F up to Eb. Piece<br/>of cake. Now we are calibrating G# from pure to low, so that C#-G# in<br/>the middle octave has the &quot;same quality&quot; as Ab-Eb a perfect fourth<br/>below. Tricky! Since you want to have a very slow beat from each. What<br/>the heck, it has been shown that the difference in between<br/>distributing the beating uniformly between them matters only as much<br/>as 0.36 cents. But just to humour you, let&apos;s consider that C#-G# is to<br/>beat 1.5 times that of Ab-Eb. You said the latter was up a fifth. What<br/>was the original equation?</p><p>1.5 * (4Eb - 3x) = (2x - 3C#)</p><p>1.5 * (1,247.2888888 - 3x) = (2x - 833.4140625)</p><p>And what was the differences from my uniform beating scheme? Your<br/>implied C#-G# at 699.238 cents VS my C#-G# at 699.6 cents &amp; your<br/>implied Ab-Eb 700.746 cents VS my Ab-Eb at 700.383 cents!</p><p>The ratio you imply for G# is 3508/2475 *<br/>4160534454923077/3118222222222222 =<br/>663416130357734278/350799999999999975 at 1103.118 cents compared to my<br/>1103.481 cents, boiling down to a 0.36 cents difference!</p><p>Finally, let&apos;s take the case of Eb-Bb, where Bb is to be lowered<br/>slightly to achieve the &quot;same quality&quot; as the two previous fifths. Do<br/>you have any proposition where it will result in drastic modifications<br/>compared to my 699.857 cent fifth between Eb-Bb?</p><p>And you still did not reveal how 0.36 cents is important to you!</p><p>______________________________________________</p><p>Here is the grand total result of your recipe with that 1.8 cent error<br/>at D &quot;corrected&quot;:</p><p>  0:          1/1           C    Dbb   unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:        101.608 cents   C#   Db<br/>  2:        197.255 cents   D    Ebb<br/>  3:        301.592 cents   D#   Eb<br/>  4:        395.743 cents   E    Fb<br/>  5:        505.502 cents   F    Gbb<br/>  6:        599.653 cents   F#   Gb<br/>  7:        698.631 cents   G    Abb<br/>  8:        801.208 cents   G#   Ab<br/>  9:        897.727 cents   A    Bbb<br/> 10:       1001.449 cents   A#   Bb<br/> 11:       1097.698 cents   B    Cb<br/> 12:       1200.000 cents   C    Dbb</p><p>Cycle of fifths:</p><p>|<br/>  0:          0.000 cents  0.000    0     0<br/>commas                      C<br/>  7:        698.631 cents -3.324<br/>-102                                 G<br/>  2:        698.624 cents -6.655<br/>-204                                 D<br/>  9:        700.473 cents -8.138   -250                                 A<br/>  4:        698.016 cents -12.077-371                                 E<br/> 11:        701.955 cents -12.077<br/>-371                                 B<br/>  6:        701.955 cents -12.077<br/>-371                                 F#<br/>  1:        701.955 cents -12.077<br/>-371                                 C#<br/>  8:        699.600 cents -14.432<br/>-443                                 G#<br/>  3:        700.383 cents -16.003<br/>-491                                 Eb<br/> 10:        699.857 cents -18.101<br/>-556                                 Bb<br/>  5:        704.053 cents -16.003<br/>-491                                 F<br/> 12:        694.498 cents -23.460  -720  -1 Pyth.<br/>commas                C<br/>Average absolute difference:     12.8686 cents<br/>Root mean square difference:     14.4709 cents<br/>Maximum absolute difference:     23.4600 cents<br/>Maximum formal fifth difference: 7.4567 cents</p><p>Errors from the values of your temperament consigned to paper:</p><p>  1:   1:         -3.563 cents -3.563280   0.5704 Hertz, 34.2269<br/>cycles/min.<br/>  2:   2:         -1.165 cents -1.164790   0.1972 Hertz, 11.8321<br/>cycles/min.<br/>  3:   3:         -3.547 cents -3.546650   0.6373 Hertz, 38.2390<br/>cycles/min.<br/>  4:   4:         -3.563 cents -3.563280   0.6761 Hertz, 40.5653<br/>cycles/min.<br/>  5:   5:         -3.547 cents -3.546650   0.7170 Hertz, 43.0188<br/>cycles/min.<br/>  6:   6:         -3.563 cents -3.563280   0.7606 Hertz, 45.6359<br/>cycles/min.<br/>  7:   7:         -0.586 cents -0.585590   0.1325 Hertz, 7.9479<br/>cycles/min.<br/>  8:   8:         -3.163 cents -3.163370   0.7587 Hertz, 45.5217<br/>cycles/min.<br/>  9:   9:         -3.592 cents -3.592380   0.9109 Hertz, 54.6525<br/>cycles/min.<br/> 10:  10:         -3.404 cents -3.403790   0.9164 Hertz, 54.9836<br/>cycles/min.<br/> 11:  11:         -3.563 cents -3.563280   1.0141 Hertz, 60.8479<br/>cycles/min.<br/> 12:  12:          1/1          0.000000   0.0000 Hertz, 0.0000<br/>cycles/min.<br/>Mode: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1   Twelve-tone Chromatic<br/>Total absolute difference  :  33.2563 cents<br/>Average absolute difference:  2.7714 cents<br/>Root mean square difference:  3.0570 cents<br/>Highest absolute difference:  3.5924 cents<br/>Number of notes different: 11</p><p>And you still have to account for that 694.5 cent fifth at F-C all<br/>while you were so haughtily bombarding UWT nr. 3 fifths that you<br/>apparently mistuned on your harpsichord.</p><p>_________________________________________________________________</p><p>First you claimed that your temperament has regular fifths, and UWT nr.<br/>3 does not, when it became clear that you cannot produce a recipe that<br/>yields the correct fifths you obtained on paper exactly everywhere,<br/>and that that set of instructions is, in your own words, &quot;the best<br/>accuracy that anyone can reasonably hope for when working directly at<br/>a real harpsichord&quot;. I have naturally come to the understanding that<br/>this is the best you can do to implement a semblance of your Bach<br/>tuning on a real harpscihord by ear, which is a DISASTER really. All<br/>pitches save G and D are 3.5 cents down on the average! Have you not<br/>yourself admitted: &quot;And, all these &quot;procured&quot; recipes on my <a href="http://www.larips.com">http://www.larips.com</a><br/> site are *by* me, describing the way I set all those various<br/>temperaments by ear.&quot;? The recipe for Lehman-Bach Temperament does not<br/>hold as you claim if you actually follow the steps you use. I stand<br/>ready to be corrected if you have some other method of setting thosefifths tempered exactly by said geometrical fractions of a rational<br/>commatic interval to the nth precision you demand that I deliver in my<br/>calculations.</p><p>You alleged that your temperament is easier to set up than mine simply<br/>because you say your methods are &quot;analog&quot; versus my &quot;digital&quot;. It has<br/>been shown that you yourself rely upon counting beats, listening to<br/>beats and comparing beats in the only recipe you have for setting your<br/>tuning on an acoustical instrument. You too take the 440 Hz=A<br/>diapason, you too count the seconds (rounded down or not), you<br/>moreover rationalize the beat count of one interval to another, etc...<br/>That&apos;s all very well and &quot;analog&quot; while my instructions for tuning by<br/>counting the beats of fifths here and there and cross-checking with<br/>the beat count of major thirds in seconds (or some other unit)<br/>&quot;digital&quot;?</p><p>You always say things about where intervals are ought to be, and how<br/>to take the square roots and geometric fractions (as if your wrist<br/>commands the tuning wrench by them!) but you failed with your recipe<br/>and refuse to recognize the end results. Your failure to set up UWT nr.<br/>3 on an harpsichord using instructions that promise to EXACTLY match<br/>the end result is a catastrophic development that I fear incapacitates<br/>your criticisms and evaluations of UWT nr.3 and the nature of<br/>proportional beat ratios.</p><p>Now is it me who: &quot;accidentally found ways to diverge from the<br/>instructions, while trying to test those instructions&quot;? Check the<br/>math, do stop making groundless assumptions and please desist from<br/>throwing about broad comments on proportional beat rates that<br/>apparently have not yet presented themselves to you on your<br/>harpsichord my dear colleague.</p><p>I implore you to utilize some electronic aid to check your results<br/>next time so that it is not just some fancy tuning you are evaluating<br/>that does not represent the descriptions!</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Dr. Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On May 22, 2010, at 5:19 PM, bplehman27 wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In your recipe, taking as reference the 440 Hz diapason for A, I read<br/>&gt;&gt; tenor A to middle E slightly flat in the same quality as those other<br/>&gt;&gt; fifths F-C and G-D.

Apparently you are doing<br/>&gt;&gt; something wrong, unless I made an error somewhere, and it appears I<br/>&gt;&gt; have not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Oz, I&apos;ve had opportunity this morning to take a closer look in<br/>&gt; the spreadsheet you sent me yesterday, plus the e-mailed notes about<br/>&gt; how you derived things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, I&apos;ll humor your use of F-A of 877/1100, because even with the<br/>&gt; use of that approximation, you ought to get better results than you<br/>&gt; actually did....  I still can&apos;t see all the processes you did,<br/>&gt; because you didn&apos;t show them, but here&apos;s how I would do it:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Temporary C a pure 4th below that F: 877/1100 x 3/4 = 2631/4400<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Temporary D a pure 5th below the A: 2/3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Next step is to find the G that&apos;s a 4th above that D, and a 5th<br/>&gt; above that C, such that it&apos;s at the GEOMETRIC mean, and such that<br/>&gt; the D-G 4th beats triplets against the C-G 5th&apos;s duplets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The pure G from that D would be 2/3 x 4/3 = 8/9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The pure G from that C would be 2631/4400 x 3/2 = 7893/8800<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The mean spot between those two phantom G candidates, geometrically,<br/>&gt; is sqrt(8/9 x 7893/8800) = .8929012976+<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the G we get by following my instructions, tuning by ear and<br/>&gt; seeking the spot where we get triplets beating against duplets from<br/>&gt; the two temporary notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The G *you* got (somehow??) was &quot;1961/1100&quot;, which when adjusted to<br/>&gt; the proper octave at 1961/2200 is .8913636363+<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your notes don&apos;t say anything about moving the C (per my<br/>&gt; instructions) to a proper spot, after using the temporary one.<br/>&gt; Again, I can&apos;t see how you derived C in its final position with your<br/>&gt; ratios, but clearly you&apos;ve ended up with C at a wrong spot vis-a-vis<br/>&gt; A.  Yours is at 302.27 cents, and it ought to be 305.87; you&apos;re off<br/>&gt; by more than 3 cents!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From your wrong G, you somehow came up with a D that you say is<br/>&gt; &quot;calculated to be 78440000000000/58716923076923&quot;.  I can&apos;t follow<br/>&gt; any of your arithmetic here, because you didn&apos;t show it, but clearly<br/>&gt; you&apos;re already accumulating so many errors recursively that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; pointless to continue.  Your D ends up at 501.3758 cents from A,<br/>&gt; somehow, while it ought to be at 501.96.  That&apos;s not as bad as the<br/>&gt; errors in the C and the G, but anyway, it&apos;s off.  They&apos;re all off.<br/>&gt; Somehow, you accidentally found ways to diverge from the<br/>&gt; instructions, while trying to test those instructions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More importantly, I can&apos;t see that you have used square roots<br/>&gt; anywhere, which is the proper procedure to place a note at a mean<br/>&gt; point relative to two other notes.  Without square roots, and<br/>&gt; therefore some irrational numbers occasionally, you&apos;re not going to<br/>&gt; get there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My &quot;triplets against duplets&quot; beating procedure, comparing<br/>&gt; successive 5ths, works whenever we&apos;re making 5ths the same size<br/>&gt; GEOMETRICALLY.  All the 5ths have some constant amount taken off<br/>&gt; them (which happens to be a fraction of the PC in mine, but it could<br/>&gt; be any constant), and the frequencies of both notes are 3/2 higher<br/>&gt; each time we move up(**), so the beat rates also increase as 3/2,<br/>&gt; &quot;triplets against duplets&quot;.  If we are looking at (for example) the<br/>&gt; open-string notes of violins and violas, and we have regularly<br/>&gt; tempered 5ths everywhere, and the A-E is beating 3/sec, the D-A will<br/>&gt; be 2/sec, the G-D is 4/3 per sec, and the C-G is 8/9 per sec.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (**) &quot;3/2 higher&quot; shortened by some small tempered amount, but close<br/>&gt; enough to 3/2 for all practical purposes on acoustic instruments,<br/>&gt; when making this comparison....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To calculate all those notes with their REGULAR GEOMETRIC tempering,<br/>&gt; if they actually have to be calculated (as opposed to tuning them<br/>&gt; directly by ear, which is much simpler!), we have to use square<br/>&gt; roots....not ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The MUSICAL skill here, as opposed to the mathematical skill, is to<br/>&gt; recognize all those identically-tempered 5ths by their quality,<br/>&gt; directly: not having to count the beats that prove they&apos;re spot-on.<br/>&gt; With practice (and I&apos;ve had 27 years of doing this), it&apos;s easy to<br/>&gt; get two neighboring 5ths set up with similar quality, without any<br/>&gt; conscious counting of beats.  And so, as I said several days ago,<br/>&gt; that&apos;s how I tune: and that&apos;s how I write tuning instructions for<br/>&gt; readers who have that similarly practiced musical skill.  That<br/>&gt; &quot;triplets against duplets&quot; check is a useful test for the similarity<br/>&gt; of the intervals, but the similarity is already directly perceptible<br/>&gt; (close enough) without it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; People who prefer mathematically-based instructions based on beat-<br/>&gt; counting are free to formulate their own sequence of setting the<br/>&gt; notes.

Bach, J.S. Bach always insisted on tuning his instruments himself, and it never took him more than 15 minutes.</p><p>As CPE wrote to Forkel for the biography of JSB,<br/>&quot;The exact tuning of his instruments as well as of the whole orchestra had his greatest attention. No one could tune and quill his instruments to please him. He did everything himself.&quot; (1774, New Bach Reader, #394)</p><p>Forkel then presented it thus:<br/>&quot;Nobody could install the quill-plectrums of his harpsichord to his satisfaction; he always did it himself. He also tuned both his harpsichord and his clavichord himself, and was so practised in the operation that it never cost him above a quarter of an hour. But then, when he played from his fancy, all the 24 keys were in his power; he did with them what he pleased. He connected the most remote as easily and as naturally together as the nearest; the hearer believed he had only modulated within the compass of a single key. He knew nothing of harshness in modulation; even his transitions in the chromatic style were as soft and flowing as if he had wholly confined himself to the diatonic scale. His Chromatic Fantasy, which is now published, may prove what I here state. All his extempore fantasies are said to have been of a similar description, but frequently even much more free, brilliant, and expressive.&quot; (1802, New Bach Reader, p436.

Bach, J.S. Bach always insisted on tuning his instruments himself, and it never took him more than 15 minutes.</p><p>As CPE wrote to Forkel for the biography of JSB,</p><p>&quot;The exact tuning of his instruments as well as of the whole orchestra had his greatest attention. No one could tune and quill his instruments to please him. He did everything himself.&quot; (1774, New Bach Reader, #394)</p><p>Forkel then presented it thus:</p><p>&quot;Nobody could install the quill-plectrums of his harpsichord to his satisfaction; he always did it himself. He also tuned both his harpsichord and his clavichord himself, and was so practised in the operation that it never cost him above a quarter of an hour. But then, when he played from his fancy, all the 24 keys were in his power; he did with them what he pleased. He connected the most remote as easily and as naturally together as the nearest; the hearer believed he had only modulated within the compass of a single key. He knew nothing of harshness in modulation; even his transitions in the chromatic style were as soft and flowing as if he had wholly confined himself to the diatonic scale. His Chromatic Fantasy, which is now published, may prove what I here state. All his extempore fantasies are said to have been of a similar description, but frequently even much more free, brilliant, and expressive.&quot; (1802, New Bach Reader, p436.

Seit 1896 studierte er an der Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik in Berlin (J. Joachim, Violine, R. Succo, Komposition). Ab 1898 studierte er Musikwissenschaft, Literaturgeschichte und Philosophie in Berlin (O. Fleischer, C. Stumpf), M&uuml;nchen und Leipzig (H. Kretzschmar). Seine Diss. (1902) &uuml;ber die &raquo;Geschichte des Instrumentalkonzerts bis A. Vivaldi&laquo; wurde in erweiterter Form als &raquo;Geschichte des Instrumentalkonzerts bis auf die Gegenwart&laquo; 1905 in Leipzig gedruckt. Bereits w&auml;hrend seines Studiums war er als Musikkritiker f&uuml;r Leipziger Zeitungen t&auml;tig. 1903-1905 war S. Herausgeber der Neuen Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Musik, 1904-39 Herausgeber des Bach-Jahrbuches. 1907 habilitierte er sich in Leipzig mit dem Thema &raquo;Die Anf&auml;nge des Oratoriums&laquo;, die 1911 erweitert als &raquo;Geschichte des Oratoriums&laquo; gedruckt wurde. Seit 1909 hatte er eine Lehrauftrag f&uuml;r Musikgeschichte am Leipziger Konservatorium. 1915 wurde er zum au&szlig;erordentlichen Professor f&uuml;r Geschichte und &Auml;sthetik der Musik an der Universit&auml;t Leipzig ernannt. 1920 wurde er in der Nachfolge von H. Abert zum Ordinarius in Halle berufen und &uuml;bernahm 1927 den Vorsitz der H&auml;ndelgesellschaft. 1928 folgte er H. Abert auf das Ordinariat f&uuml;r Musikgeschichte an der Berliner Universit&auml;t, wo er bis zu seinem Tod blieb. Er war Vorsitzender der Kommission der DDT und Pr&auml;sident der Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Musikwissenschaft. Als gleicherma&szlig;en praktisch ausgebildeter Musiker legte er gro&szlig;en Wert auf die Verbindung von Musikgeschichte und Praxis, was sich z.B. in seiner T&auml;tigkeit als Leiter der Collegia musica in Leipzig, Halle und Berlin zeigte.

S. went to the cross and the Anne School in Dresden, and took violin lessons. Already in early youth, he received many impressions through the musical life of Dresden. Since 1896, he studied at the Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik in Berlin (J. Joachim, violin, R. Succo, composition). From 1898 he studied musicology, literature, history and philosophy in Berlin (O. Fleischer, C. Stumpf), Munich and Leipzig (H. Kretzschmar). His Diss (1902) about the &quot;history of the concerto by Vivaldi,&quot; was in expanded form as a &quot;history of the concerto to be printed on the presence of&quot; 1905 in Leipzig. During his studies he worked as a music critic for newspapers in Leipzig. P. 1903-1905 was editor of the Neue Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Musik, 1904-39 editor of the Bach-Jahrbuch. In 1907 he qualified as in Leipzig, with the theme &quot;The beginnings&quot; of the oratorio, which expanded in 1911 as &quot;History of the Oratorio&quot; was printed. Since 1909, he was a lecturer in music history at the Leipzig Conservatory. In 1915 he was appointed extraordinary professor of history and aesthetics of music at the University of Leipzig. In 1920 he was appointed to the succession of H. Abert Hall to full professor in 1927 and took over the chairmanship of the Handel Society. In 1928, he was followed by H. Abert in the chair of music history at the University of Berlin, where he remained until his death. He was chairman of the Commission of DDT and President of the Society for Musicology. As a trained musician, he practically equally attached great importance to the combination of music history and practice, which, for example, showed in his work as head of the Collegia musica in Leipzig, Halle and Berlin. S. was one of the most important German musicologist of the first half of the 20th Century.

But, on account of the fall, man cannot even keep the commandments without the help of grace and the 7 gifts of the Holy Spirit. Moreover, the number 7 signifies holiness, since God blessed the 7th day and made it holy (Gen 2:3). But 10 plus 7 equals 17, and if all the numbers from 1 to 17 are added together (1+2+3Â…+17), they equal 153. Hence, the 153 fish signify that all the elect are to be saved by the gift of grace (7) and the following of the commandments (10).<br/>Or rather: St. Augustine notes that there were 7 disciples in the boat (Peter, Thomas, Nathanael, the sons of Zebedee, James and John, and two other disciples), who had all been filled with the 7 gifts of the Holy Spirit. 7 times 7 equals 49. 49 plus 1 makes the perfection of 50. Now, 3 is the number of the Trinity and also of our faith (which is founded on the Trinity); but 50 times 3 (for our faith) is 150, plus 3 (for the Trinity) is 153. Hence, the 153 fish signify the fullness of the Church (7), filled with the Holy Spirit (7), perfected (50) in her faith (3) in the most holy Trinity (3).<br/>St. Gregory the Great says: 10 and 7 are perfect numbers, which added together make 17. This, times 3, for the perfection of faith in the Trinity, makes 51. This, times 3 again, makes 153.<br/>St. Cyril breaks 153 into 100 (the great number of gentiles to be saved), plus 50 (the smaller number of Jews to be saved), plus 3 (the Trinity who saves all). Others follow St. Cyril, but modify this as follows: 100 (the multitude of married lay faithful in the Church), plus 50 (the many faithful who commit themselves later in life to continence either living as widows or living with their spouse in a brother-sister relationship), plus 3 (the precious few who commit their whole lives to celibacy as virgins) equals 153 (the whole Church taken together as a single body).<br/>&quot;</p><p>Just those ennumerations corresponds exactly with the<br/>arithmetically calculations of<br/>bars in Friedrich-Smend&apos;s works<br/>and also with A.Werckmeister considerations about &apos;holy&apos; concepts<br/>of how to divide the Commata into subparts, see also:<br/><a href="http://tokenofperdition.com/numbers/nu153.php">http://tokenofperdition.com/numbers/nu153.php</a><br/>&quot;<br/>Gematria<br/>    Adding the numerical value of the Greek word Maria, 152, with the &quot;alpha&quot; of the God, 1, we obtain 153, which makes say to Peignot that God needed Mary to do useful work the salvation.&quot;</p><p>Therefore I do suppose, that an somehow harsh sounding</p><p>153/152 = (17*3^2) / (19*2^3) = ~11.35...Cents almost but &lt; PC^(1/2)</p><p>tempered 5th: D-A<br/>should express maybe the pain of<br/>mother-mary(19)  about the crucification of her son(17).<br/>But already Bach&apos;s uncles and others used that codification by numbers<br/>in theirs sacral-compositions.

I don&apos;t think Tatlow denied any of the simple number games that plenty of people in the period used (Yearsley had a nice way to view these number games in the book I mentioned earlier). In fact, because many composers knew something about them and used them to varying degrees, they are probably irrelevant to any explanation of what makes JS Bach&apos;s music so powerfully expressive.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this has been the primary task to which numerological studies have been put in studying Bach&apos;s music.</p><p>If I remember correctly, Tatlow provides evidence that the number alphabets commonly used to analyze Bach&apos;s music are anachronistic.&nbsp; It&apos;s been some years since I read her book, so I should probably check this out again.</p><p>The majority of Newton&apos;s writings are what we would now consider mystical and even pseudo-scientific; in fact, he expressed irritation at the drain on his time required by the studies that we now consider the cornerstone of physical science.&nbsp; I&apos;m not sure, though, that Bach was obsessed about the same things.&nbsp; I used to want to believe in the whole mystical passage, but I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that the numerological part is far less important than his concern with &quot;musica poetica,&quot; above all in his cantatas.&nbsp; The complex articulation of the intended theological message via the selection of appropriate musical figures, contrasts and transformations between and among these figures, harmonic plan, use of chromaticism, contrapuntal design, and so forth, was undoubtedly the main focus of Bach&apos;s concern. If he used plenty of 3-note figures, I doubt that he intended each one to shout &quot;Trinity&quot;, just as most of the A-C-B&nbsp; [=H] figures in his music are<br/> not incomplete spellings of his name (unless one believes Bach was sighing &quot;Ach!&quot; at those moments!).</p><p>Especially considering the speed at which he was turning out cantatas, most of them far more complex than any other composer&apos;s of the period, the assumption that Bach counted out bars as a means of measuring the duration of pieces so that they would fit into their intended time-slot makes more sense to me (especially when one notes the sudden reduction of the duration of his cantatas soon after he arrived in Leipzig, probably after he received complaints about their length) than any mystical explanation I have seen.&nbsp; Bach undoubtedly used some of the standard numerical formulas passed down by tradition, but I see these as&nbsp; &quot;ready-at-hand&quot; templates that made the job of composing these fantastically complex cantatas easier; they were almost certainly not buried messages containing deep significance.</p><p>best</p><p>Franklin</p></div>
