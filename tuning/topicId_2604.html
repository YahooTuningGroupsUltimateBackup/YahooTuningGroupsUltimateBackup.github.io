Other<br/>nonoctave tunings have similar characteristics too, of course.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0 8 18 is an inversion of a major triad.</p><p>   Well, actually that&apos;s in root position, but no matter...</p><p>   And similarly, 0 8 11 18 is pretty accurate dominant seventh chord (4:6:7:10).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 88CET approximates many just ratios. Some are &lt; 2/1: 21/20 7/6 11/9 9/7<br/>&gt; 3/2 5/3 7/4.</p><p>   It&apos;s also pretty good at 10:7, and ... well, decent anyway ... at 11:6.</p><p>   Denny Genovese characterized it (these aren&apos;t his exact words, but the general<br/>gist of his characterization) as honorary just intonation, in that it provides a<br/>lot of new pitch relationships.  Brian McLaren is convinced that its JI<br/>approximations aren&apos;t as interesting as its melodic properties.</p><p>   I think personally that the most important thing about 88CET is that it forces<br/>you to think differently;  and I mean REEEEALLY differently!  That alone often<br/>causes you to think of things that probably would never have crossed your mind<br/>otherwise.</p></div>
