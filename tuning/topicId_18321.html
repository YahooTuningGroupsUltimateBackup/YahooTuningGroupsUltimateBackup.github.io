(Pronounced differently from Arnold Schoenberg... a<br/>common mistake)</p><p>Another wonderful comparison is the lifestyle.  Many chess<br/>grandmasters, as grand-music-masters, ended in poverty. (Glad that<br/>doesn&apos;t happen today!)</p><p>As Schonberg chronicles:  &quot;Philidor died in London on August 31,<br/>1795, alone and destitute -- the first of many grandmasters to die a<br/>pauper. &apos;On Monday last,&apos; a London paper said, &apos;Mr. Philidor, the<br/>celebrated chess player, made his last move.&apos;&quot;</p><p>_________ ____ ____ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>shreeswifty &#x3C;ppagano@bellsouth.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2001 8:18:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes actually i have<br/>map a grid of the lambdoma<br/>if you use Hans Kaysers grid available in Akroasis<br/>I&apos;ll play you</p><p>Pat Pagano, Director<br/>South East Just Intonation Society<br/><a href="http://indians.australians.com/meherbaba/">http://indians.australians.com/meherbaba/</a><br/><a href="http://www.screwmusicforever.com/SHREESWIFT/">http://www.screwmusicforever.com/SHREESWIFT/</a><br/>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: Sarn Richard Ursell &lt;<a href="mailto:thcdelta@ihug.co.nz">thcdelta@ihug.co.nz</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Sunday, February 04, 2001 8:03 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Chess music</p><p>&gt; I have been meaning to ask for some feedback on this...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Has anyone ever made music from chess??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have had a mad passion for three player chess for a long time, and I<br/>&gt; checked out a chess variants page, and found about a dozen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have invented many of my own chess variants, also.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any comments?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Sarn.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

If you say,<br/>what? I&apos;d say that&apos;s part of what I&apos;m learning.</p><p>L: The question would be more how do you find out which forces you set<br/>in motion?</p><p>B: I&apos;ll let you know by your book ten (laughs).</p><p>L: After twenty years of study, you must have *some* idea!</p><p>B: I can only talk about aspects of this. In terms of what I&apos;m really<br/>dealing with in this time period, I can&apos;t talk about that because I<br/>would be disrespecting you and disrespecting me.</p><p>L: Well, tell me what you can tell me (laughs).</p><p>B: But I&apos;ve just told you! (laughs.) OK, I don&apos;t want to play with you<br/>in this area...play is not the right way of saying it, but I don&apos;t<br/>want to disrespect you by talking about something that I have not<br/>thought out, or that I have thought out but am not ready to talk<br/>about. Remember the isolated pawn theory!</p><p>L: The *what*?</p><p>B: The isolated pawn theory. Is it justified to kill an innocent pawn<br/>just because your opponent has made a mistake and left that pawn<br/>unprotected? I was very concerned about this question as a young man<br/>and later in Paris I met Bruce Carrington, who is a very special<br/>friend of mine, and he talked to me about a woman who had told him<br/>that she just destroyed a man, destroyed him vibrationally, and this<br/>man was hurt. He asked her, why did you do it? And she said, well, he<br/>came into my path. That&apos;s what she said; so we had to deal with that -<br/>she destroyed him because he was there. OK, I can relate to that. Now,<br/>on the chess board, if a person puts out a pawn that is not protected,<br/>you have to destroy that pawn - like, how dare they do that! It&apos;s<br/>*just* to kill a pawn that is not protected, as long as it doesn&apos;t<br/>disturb your position on the board and if it further enhances your<br/>objectives. To destroy that pawn would be part of the lesson that has<br/>to be learned: destruction in that context becomes even respectable.<br/>That was the isolated pawn theory.</p><p>L: This is a justice without mercy ...</p><p>B: No, wait, that&apos;s not the end of the story. I suddenly discovered<br/>something - you don&apos;t *want* to destroy anybody! If you can help it.<br/>Don&apos;t kill the pawn. Why? Because of *unlogic*. OK, back to the<br/>question: I can&apos;t answer it because of the isolated pawn theory.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/4/2001 7:21:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/18333">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/18333</a></p><p>&gt; she destroyed him because he was there.

This has gone in and out of print, at least in paperback.  And of course, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; by Lewis Carroll has been done with music in film versions and was based on a hypothetical series of moves.
