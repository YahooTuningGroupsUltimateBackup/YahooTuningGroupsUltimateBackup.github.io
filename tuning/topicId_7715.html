Enjoy!</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The ancient Greeks called it the Lambdoma, Partch called it the Tonality<br/>Diamond, and Novarro must have called it something.*  The structure is old,<br/>and has a funny habit of being re-discovered many times across a wide<br/>variety of disciplines.</p><p>[* There are minor differences here.  &quot;Lambdoma&quot; is usually reserved for<br/>the infinite diamond of all consecutive counting numbers, while Partch&apos;s<br/>diamond exists at some &quot;limit&quot; and involves adjustments and omissions<br/>related to octave equivalence.]</p><p>But what is it, this matrix of order/limit/cap X?</p><p>1. A fashionable arrangement of all the ratios in a Farey series of order X?<br/>2. The solutions to an old puzzle involving colored space-filling polytopes?<br/>3. A list of all the modes of a scale relative to one master key?<br/>4. A Cartesian cross between a set of rationals and their reciprocals?<br/>5. A slightly-mutilated Rothenberg interval matrix (aka difference matrix)?<br/>6. The one structure with the highest chord/note ratio at limit X?<br/>7. The solution to a sphere-packing problem in X dimensions?</p><p>[#1.]  The number of items in a Farey series of order X, and the number of<br/>items in a Lambdoma of cap-X, is X^2.  A Farey series of order X is a list<br/>of all the fractions that you can make using whole numbers up to X.  So X^2<br/>makes sense, because you&apos;re taking X things two at a time; there are two<br/>places for a number in a fraction.  X^2 makes sense for the Lambdoma when<br/>you realize the Lambdoma is a square; as a child you learn to count objects<br/>in a grid by counting along the edges and multiplying.</p><p>[#2.]  Some time ago, John Chalmers posted to the list about his fondness<br/>for Martin Gardner&apos;s recreational math.  Recently, when looking thru my<br/>bookshelf for something to read on my frequent bus trips to and from New<br/>York city, I picked out &quot;Fractal Music Hypercards and More&quot;, which proved<br/>to be a lot of fun.</p><p>One of the articles in it, &quot;The Thirty Color Cubes&quot; (it doesn&apos;t seem to say<br/>what issue of Scientific American it was reprinted from) describes two<br/>classic &quot;domino tiling&quot; puzzles involving a set of cubes.  With 6 colors<br/>and one color to a face, there are 30 ways to paint a cube so it uses each<br/>color only once.</p><p>One puzzle is to take one of these cubes and then build a two-by-two model<br/>of it using 8 of the remaining cubes, so that all touching interior faces<br/>of the model match in color.  A second puzzle is to find a set of 5 cubes<br/>such that they can be placed same-color down on a table and have each of<br/>the 5 remaining colors showing faces up.</p><p>John H. Conway found a graphic method for solving both of these puzzles --<br/>an arrangement of the 30 cubes in a grid.  The grid has no blocks along<br/>this mysterious diagonal... when I saw this, my diamond warning lights went<br/>off.  With 6 factors the diamond has 36 members, 6 of which will contain<br/>two of the same color (the 1/1&apos;s), leaving 30 (of course, we are used to<br/>the 11-limit diamond having 29 pitches, as we only eliminate 5 of the<br/>1/1&apos;s, giving 31, and then eliminate the 9/3 and 3/9).</p><p>All of the solutions to the second puzzle are given by the rows and columns<br/>in Conway&apos;s matrix.  This puzzle is equivalent to selecting o- or<br/>utonalities (minus the unity) from the diamond.  The color touching the<br/>table is the numerary nexus.</p><p>The first puzzle is solved by finding the inversion of the prototype cube<br/>and taking the 8 cubes for the model from the row and column that contain<br/>the inversion cube, minus the inversion cube itself and the 1/1&apos;s (11 minus<br/>1 minus 2).  I do not know what musical analog this first puzzle has.</p><p>A final note is that Conway&apos;s matrix itself meets the &quot;domino condition&quot;.<br/>That is, all the touching faces match in color.  Again I do not know the<br/>musical significance (if any).</p><p>It seems to me that the diamond should provide solutions for similar<br/>puzzles involving any number of things and a corresponding set of<br/>thing-sided space-filling polytopes.</p><p>[#3-4.]  This was my breakthru with the diamond.  I had come up with a<br/>bunch of 7-limit scales (one of which was identical to Kraig Grady&apos;s<br/>&quot;centaur&quot; scale), and I wanted to compare them by how &quot;low numbered&quot; the<br/>ratios in each of the modes were.  That is, if I modulated to one of the<br/>other notes in the scale, what kind of relationships would I have?  In<br/>essence, I wanted to make a given note in the scale the &quot;1/1&quot;.  This can be<br/>done by multiplying the entire scale by the reciprocal of the given note.<br/>Doing this for each note of the scale in turn, I wound up with the<br/>cross-set of the original scale and its subharmonic inversion --- a diamond!</p><p>[#5.]  This article was inspired by John Chalmers -- whose substantial work<br/>and ready help has played no small part in my understanding of music --<br/>when he suggested I explain on the list my recent statement that a scale&apos;s<br/>Rothenberg interval matrix was &quot;just its Lambdoma or tonality diamond&quot;.  I<br/>believe that anyone who read that recent Rothenberg post, and up to here in<br/>this article, should have no problems turning a diamond into an interval<br/>matrix and back (hint: the interval classes in the interval matrix are the<br/>diagonals on the diamond).  Of course, Partch used the diamond to generate<br/>a pitch set, while Rothenberg used it to generate an interval set (it would<br/>make sense to take the interval matrix of a diamond, but not the diamond of<br/>an interval matrix), but the structure is the same.</p><p>[#6.]  I am not aware of a proof, but there can be no doubt.</p><p>[#7.]  A famous problem asks for the most compact arrangement of generic<br/>spheres of unit diameter in N dimensions.  In 2-D, the generic sphere is<br/>the circle, and the closest packing has been proven to be &quot;hexagonal&quot;.  If<br/>we tile a plane with circles in this way, and mark the centers of the<br/>circles on the plane, we get the 2-D triangular lattice.  If we then take<br/>any given circle, and all the circles whose centers lie one unit away, and<br/>erase their centers&apos; marks, we will have a hexagonal hole in our lattice.<br/>Interestingly, the 3-factor diamond is this hexagon when mapped to the 2-D<br/>(3-factor) triangular lattice.</p><p>A similar situation occurs in 3-D.  It was conjectured long ago, but only<br/>recently proven, that the closest packing of 3-D spheres in 3-space is the<br/>so-called &quot;face-centered cubic&quot; packing.  In this arrangement, the centers<br/>of a given sphere and all those 1 unit away form the vertices of a<br/>cuboctahedron.  Again, when the 4-factor diamond is mapped to the<br/>tetrahedral (3-D triangular) lattice, the diamond represents this &quot;unit<br/>packing&quot; of spheres (the cuboctahedron).</p><p>So it is tempting to say that the closest packing of N-dimensional spheres<br/>is achieved by centering them on the vertices of the N-dimensional<br/>triangular lattice, and that the (N+1) factor diamond represents the unit<br/>packing on this lattice.  I am not aware of any proof of this, however.  It<br/>is interesting to speculate on the relationship between this statement and<br/>the one of #6. . .</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7716 href="#7716">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
