(pitch class) and I.C. (interval class)<br/>nomenclature.</p><p>I was wondering if that could be applied in any way to Margo Schulter&apos;s<br/>Medieval tuning definitions... (??)</p><p>The &quot;conversity&quot; would be, of course, an I.C. inversion, &quot;interval<br/>class,&quot; as contrasted with a P.C., &quot;pitch class,&quot; inversion.</p><p>I&apos;m not certain if the chromatic methodology generally used for this<br/>kind of set theory would have any relevance to Medieval tuning theory,<br/>since each semi-tone gets a number, starting with the first pitch = 0.<br/>(i.e. the perfect fifth is I.C. 7, and G4 is P.C. 7 when starting from<br/>C4=0, but the two nomenclatures would not coincide if we were starting<br/>on a different pitch -- for example, obviously, the perfect fifth from<br/>D4 to A4 would have I.C. 7 again, but A4 would be P.C. 9 with C4=0).</p><p>Maybe the diatonic nomenclature that Ms. Schulter uses is more pertinent<br/>for this period of music, since there is limited chromaticism (??)</p><p>I obviously haven&apos;t yet worked out any details... but I was just<br/>thinking that the traditional (and very much emphasized) distinction<br/>between P.C. inversions and I.C. inversions in traditional set theory<br/>might have some relevance to the Schulter work...</p><p>Just an idea...
