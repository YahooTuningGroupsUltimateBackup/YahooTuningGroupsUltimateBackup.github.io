How are they<br/>&gt; different?</p><p>Units of frequency are usually cycles per second (aka<br/>Hertz), abbreviated cps or Hz.  Cents are units of<br/>logarithmic frequency.  A cent is equal in size to one<br/>step of 1200-tone equal temperament.  That is, it is<br/>1/100th of a &quot;semitone&quot; on a guitar or piano.  Its value<br/>is the 1200th root of 2, or 2^(1/1200).</p><p>Pitch perception is logarithmic with respect to frequency.<br/>That is, two tones with frequencies standing in a 2:1<br/>ratio sound like an octave no matter what pitch you play<br/>them at, ie. 100 Hz. &amp; 200 Hz., 400 Hz. &amp; 800 Hz., etc.</p><p>&gt; What is the logarithmic cents actually a measure of,<br/>&gt; some sort of position?</p><p>A musical interval is a distance between two pitches.<br/>Sometimes pitches are named after the interval they form<br/>with a fixed reference pitch, like A=440 or the tonic<br/>of a piece of music.  Saying &quot;the third&quot;, for example,<br/>means E in the key of C.  Cents may be used in this<br/>fashion, though I think that&apos;s pretty rare.  It&apos;s more<br/>common with just intonation frequency ratios.  For<br/>example, pitches are called things like 3/2, 5/3, etc.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=67606 href="#67606">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2006 6:58:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Although Carl did an excellent job in answering your questions, Dan, let me<br/>dare to reply to the last paragraph.</p><p>There are several units of intervallic measurement that can explain how far<br/>away a certain note is from a &quot;tone of reference&quot;. Cents, as proposed by<br/>Alexander Ellis, which corresponds to 1/100th of an &quot;equal semitone&quot;, is by<br/>far the most famous one. Before that, people used Savarts, I believe, the<br/>corrected version of which equals exactly 4 cents.</p><p>But these units are meaningless if you are playing a guitar which is<br/>designed specifically to accomodate twelve-tone equal temperament, where the<br/>smallest unit is ordinarily 1 equally tempered semitone.</p><p>So, using this unit of measurement, you can see that the note G4 in<br/>reference to C4 (~260 Hz) is 7 units up (hence, 700 cents). This means, that<br/>in the key of C, G occupies the 7th position in the chromatic scale.</p><p>You can assign numbers from 1 to 12 in this fashion to the twelve notes,<br/>with 0 denoting the tone (i.e. note) of reference in any particular key you<br/>might wish to sound.</p><p>Thus, in the key of C,</p><p>0=C<br/>1<br/>2=D<br/>3<br/>4=E<br/>5=F<br/>6<br/>7=G<br/>8<br/>9=A<br/>10<br/>11=B<br/>12=c</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Dan Amateur&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:xamateur_dan@yahoo.ca">xamateur_dan@yahoo.ca</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 02 Ekim 2006 Pazartesi 3:37<br/>Subject: [tuning] Difference between Cents and Frequency</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can some one tell me what the conceptual difference<br/>&gt; actually is between the term &apos;cents&apos; and &apos;frequency&apos; ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand that cents is a logarithmic measure of<br/>&gt; some kind and that frequency is simply a rate of<br/>&gt; vibratory speed over time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand there is a relation between the two and<br/>&gt; they can be converted into each other, but they do not<br/>&gt; seem to be the exact same thing.
