When I first saw these numbers, I was a bit unsure what they<br/>meant; but when I ran them through GNU Emacs Calc, and found that they<br/>defined an interval of about 5.7578 cents, I recognized that<br/>measurement in cents as something like the difference between a<br/>familiar (to me) Pythagorean diminished fifth (1024:729) and a 7:5.<br/>When I divided 1024:729 by 7:5 (a handy Emacs Calc feature for tuning<br/>enthusiasts), I indeed got 5120:5103.</p><p>Here my first musical reaction from a medievalist view is that the<br/>diminished fifth, although it certainly occurs in Gothic or modern<br/>Xeno-Gothic music, may be less important for directed verticality<br/>because it is the one unstable interval which cannot resolve to a<br/>stable 3-limit interval by stepwise contrary motion. Seconds, thirds,<br/>sixths, and sevenths are the unstable intervals which play a leading<br/>role in directed cadential progressions -- and all of these intervals<br/>have septimal schisma versions only 3.80 cents or so from 7-based<br/>values.</p><p>Further, in finding this septimal schisma of 3.80 cents &quot;natural&quot;<br/>rather than &quot;arbitrary,&quot; I should emphasize that I approach the<br/>problem mainly from a perspective of Xeno-Gothic tuning. The purpose<br/>of this &quot;neo-medieval&quot; Pythagorean or 3-limit just intonation (JI)<br/>tuning is not to approximate 5-limit or 7-limit JI, but to provide the<br/>usual Pythagorean intervals plus some interesting variants a<br/>Pythagorean comma wider or narrower.</p><p>While it may be poetic to speak of &quot;xenharmonic bridges&quot; as both Joe<br/>Monzo and I do, maybe the term &quot;commatic variants&quot; would be more<br/>descriptive of what these extra Xeno-Gothic intervals are intended to<br/>do. If the septimal schisma were actually 5 cents or even 10 cents<br/>rather than 3.8 cents, this wouldn&apos;t bother me; I like the idea of an<br/>extended Pythagorean tuning with commatic variants, whether or not<br/>these variants happen to match very closely intervals produced in some<br/>other kind of JI system.</p><p>Here there may be a difference of taste among people in our Tuning<br/>List community on the mathematical as well as musical level.<br/>Personally I love &quot;large-integer JI,&quot; and the septimal schisma of<br/>Xeno-Gothic might be an example par excellence. I find beauty in<br/>having a simple linear chain of fifths providing such a variety of<br/>intervals, such a subtle range of ratios. Here we might apply a phrase<br/>which is also the title of one of my favorite childhood books: _The<br/>Lore of Large Numbers_.</p><p>For other people, who are oriented to &quot;small-integer JI,&quot;<br/>approximations involving &quot;simpler&quot; ratios may seem more elegant even<br/>if they are also less accurate.</p><p>For example, the septimal schisma of 33554432:33480783 (the<br/>difference, for example, between a Pythagorean minor seventh a comma<br/>smaller than 16:9, 8388608:4782969, and a 7:4) is about 3.80 cents. In<br/>comparison, as already noted, a 5120:5103 is about 5.76 cents; and a<br/>225:224 is about 7.71 cents.</p><p>Thus the septimal schisma is indeed a _closer_ approximation than<br/>either of these &quot;simpler&quot; ratios. As you observe, it is, however, not<br/>so close an approximation as the Pythagorean 5-limit schisma of<br/>32805:32768 (~1.95 cents).</p><p>Comparing these approximations raises another knotty question:<br/>&quot;how close is close&quot; in approaching simple integer ratios in different<br/>odd-limits? While this may not be a big issue in Xeno-Gothic with its<br/>&quot;commatic variants&quot; seen as alternate flavors of the usual unstable<br/>Pythagorean intervals, with septimal schisma intervals inviting<br/>&quot;superefficient&quot; resolutions to 3-limit stability, it may be an<br/>important issue if someone is using Pythagorean to approximate 7-limit<br/>JI.</p><p>For example, if we consider a 3:2 fifth, then the Pythagorean 5-limit<br/>schisma of ~1.95 cents is almost identical to the tempering of the<br/>fifth in 12-tone equal temperament (12-tet). The septimal schisma of<br/>~3.80 cents is comparable (on the largish side) to 1/6-comma meantone;<br/>a 5120:5103 of ~5.76 cents to something between 1/4-comma and<br/>2/7-comma; and a 225:224 at 7.71 cents to 1/3 _Pythagorean_ comma,<br/>about the limit (in some 18th-century well-temperaments) of historical<br/>practice in the European compositional tradition.</p><p>However, this is for a 3:2 fifth; for a 5:4 third, I would consider<br/>3.8 cents a quite close approximation, and might guess that for a 7:4<br/>or 9:7, etc., it would be quite close also. However, someone seeking<br/>accurate 7-limit JI as opposed to commatic variants on Pythagorean<br/>intervals might say &quot;not close enough&quot; -- and it has been commented<br/>that even the tuning errors of conventional microtunable synthesizers<br/>(on the order of 1-2 cents) may be &quot;not good enough&quot; for JI at its<br/>most exacting.</p><p>There has been an interesting discussion here about the &quot;zone of<br/>attraction&quot; for various intervals such as 5:4 or 9:7, and the various<br/>schismas might be considered as part of this open dialogue.</p><p>However, at least for me, &quot;objective&quot; measures of &quot;accuracy&quot; in<br/>approximating a given interval may not be the decisive factors in<br/>choosing a given tuning system. I was an enthusiastic exponent of<br/>Pythagorean tuning for medieval music and modern offshoots long before<br/>John Chalmers informed me of its quasi-septimal approximations; and I<br/>am also fascinated by the corresponding intervals in 17-tet, much<br/>further removed from 7-based ratios (e.g. major third, ~423.5 cents).</p><p>For other people, 225:224 or 5120:5203 may be intervals of prime<br/>theoretical importance, intervals which fit into some elegant system<br/>and thus share this elegance. In such a system, the Pythagorean<br/>septimal schisma may seem like an &quot;odd&quot; or less elegant approach.</p><p>Thus your response to my comments on the septimal schisma may<br/>illustrate how we evaluate intervals based on such factors as musical<br/>setting and theoretical taste: this theme may be a very nontrivial one<br/>as the Tuning List provides an opportunity to discuss these diverse<br/>musics and tuning systems.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2000 3:40:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter wrote;</p><p>&gt; Maybe the matter of the 5120:5103, and my reaction to it, may give<br/>&gt; some clue as to how these personal tastes and associations (musical as<br/>&gt; well as mathematical) can give color to one&apos;s theoretical<br/>&gt; response.

I don&apos;t usually look at intervals that small. I prefer<br/>to think in terms of commas.  The interval 7:4 is flat of 16:9 by the septimal<br/>comma of 64:63.  That&apos;s a 27.3 cent interval.</p><p>Septimal schismic temperament is defined by setting this comma to be equal to<br/>both the syntonic comma of 81:80 or 21.5 cents and the Pythagorean comma 23.5<br/>cents (I don&apos;t know the ratio, and can&apos;t be bothered to work it out).</p><p>I know that 7:4 is a comma flat of 16:9, and 8:5 is a comma sharp of 16:9.  I<br/>also know that 7:6, 32:27 and 6:5 are each separated by commas, as are 5:4,<br/>81:64 and 9:7.  Although I could work out the number of steps on the spiral of<br/>fifths that correspond to all these intervals, the equivalent Pythagorean<br/>intervals don&apos;t interest me at all.  In fact, I had to work out 81:64 for this<br/>post: I only know it as the Pythagorean major third, a comma above the just<br/>major third.</p><p>So a schisma is defined as the interval which is equivalent to a unison in a<br/>schismic temperament.  The difference between two commas will a ways be a<br/>schisma.  So, if you define your commas, the schismas take care of themselves.<br/>As they&apos;re all approximated away, they aren&apos;t of themselves at all interesting<br/>in a schismic temperament.</p><p>Approximating to a unison is a bit like setting equal to zero.  So, as 2*0=0,<br/>that means adding or subtracting schismas will always leave you with more<br/>schismas.  Hence 225:224, 5120:5103, and the one at 3.8 cents are all separated<br/>by the usual 5-limit comma.  This is why the choice is arbitrary.  The smaller<br/>they get (or larger from 225:224) the more complex.  So, as they&apos;re all<br/>equivalent, and we need two to define the temperament, I take the two simplest<br/>ones.  But it doesn&apos;t matter which you choose: the result is the same.  all<br/>commas are equal.</p><p>It may be that a temperament that zeros the larger schismas would be more<br/>accurately described as kleismic.  But if I called it that, you can get people<br/>would think it had something to do with Klezma.</p><p>Right, let&apos;s find out where these schismas come from.  One must be the<br/>difference between a septimal and syntonic comma.</p><p>64/63*80/81 = 5120/5103</p><p>What a suprise.  The 3.8 cent schisma is a 5-limit schisma flat of this, and a<br/>Pythagorean comma is a 5-limit schisma sharp of a syntonic comma, so the 3.8<br/>cent schisma must be the difference between the Pythagorean and septimal commas.<br/> I don&apos;t even need to work out the ratios!  (Of course, knowing the cent values<br/>helps).  225/224, then, isn&apos;t the difference between any named commas, but is<br/>still dimensionally a schisma.</p><p>&gt; Here my first musical reaction from a medievalist view is that the<br/>&gt; diminished fifth, although it certainly occurs in Gothic or modern<br/>&gt; Xeno-Gothic music, may be less important for directed verticality<br/>&gt; because it is the one unstable interval which cannot resolve to a<br/>&gt; stable 3-limit interval by stepwise contrary motion. Seconds, thirds,<br/>&gt; sixths, and sevenths are the unstable intervals which play a leading<br/>&gt; role in directed cadential progressions -- and all of these intervals<br/>&gt; have septimal schisma versions only 3.80 cents or so from 7-based<br/>&gt; values.</p><p>I go by the odd-limit, and consider all 7-limit intervals of equal importance.<br/>The 3.8 cent schisma is the only septimal schisma with no factors of 5, which<br/>may be relevant..  It would be more accurate to say I&apos;m interested in the<br/>9-limit, but I&apos;ll keep talking 7-limit for simplicity.</p><p>I find it hard to see why, with 17 notes available, you wouldn&apos;t be pulled away<br/>from the Pythagorean intervals, and towards the 5- or 7-limit.  Quite likely<br/>the European tradition would have moved the same way, had 17 notes become<br/>popular, but it&apos;s fruitless to speculate.</p><p>&gt; Further, in finding this septimal schisma of 3.80 cents &quot;natural&quot;<br/>&gt; rather than &quot;arbitrary,&quot; I should emphasize that I approach the<br/>&gt; problem mainly from a perspective of Xeno-Gothic tuning. The purpose<br/>&gt; of this &quot;neo-medieval&quot; Pythagorean or 3-limit just intonation (JI)<br/>&gt; tuning is not to approximate 5-limit or 7-limit JI, but to provide the<br/>&gt; usual Pythagorean intervals plus some interesting variants a<br/>&gt; Pythagorean comma wider or narrower.</p><p>Is that right?  I thought Xeno-Gothic was 7-limit schismic with Pythagorean<br/>tuning -- or untempered schismic temperament, so to speak.</p><p>&gt; While it may be poetic to speak of &quot;xenharmonic bridges&quot; as both Joe<br/>&gt; Monzo and I do, maybe the term &quot;commatic variants&quot; would be more<br/>&gt; descriptive of what these extra Xeno-Gothic intervals are intended to<br/>&gt; do. If the septimal schisma were actually 5 cents or even 10 cents<br/>&gt; rather than 3.8 cents, this wouldn&apos;t bother me; I like the idea of an<br/>&gt; extended Pythagorean tuning with commatic variants, whether or not<br/>&gt; these variants happen to match very closely intervals produced in some<br/>&gt; other kind of JI system.</p><p>Well, if it reached 10 cents it would be getting on for half a comma, and so<br/>ambiguous.  But yes, there are plenty of interesting intervals that don&apos;t match<br/>simple ratios.  Pythagorean thirds are important in schismic tuning, and can be<br/>used to add a bit of spice to 5-limit music, or make 7-limit music more<br/>ambiguous, or simple to get the melodies &quot;right&quot;.  I consider the relative<br/>simplicity of there ratios unimportant: they&apos;re beyond the threshold where the<br/>resulting consonance will be audible.</p><p>&gt; Here there may be a difference of taste among people in our Tuning<br/>&gt; List community on the mathematical as well as musical level.<br/>&gt; Personally I love &quot;large-integer JI,&quot; and the septimal schisma of<br/>&gt; Xeno-Gothic might be an example par excellence. I find beauty in<br/>&gt; having a simple linear chain of fifths providing such a variety of<br/>&gt; intervals, such a subtle range of ratios. Here we might apply a phrase<br/>&gt; which is also the title of one of my favorite childhood books: _The<br/>&gt; Lore of Large Numbers_.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; For other people, who are oriented to &quot;small-integer JI,&quot;<br/>&gt; approximations involving &quot;simpler&quot; ratios may seem more elegant even<br/>&gt; if they are also less accurate.</p><p>That&apos;s the stuff!  Although I still keep the linear chain of fifths, but temper<br/>them.  This has a conceptual beauty, rather than being something I&apos;d expect to<br/>be audible.</p><p>&gt; However, this is for a 3:2 fifth; for a 5:4 third, I would consider<br/>&gt; 3.8 cents a quite close approximation, and might guess that for a 7:4<br/>&gt; or 9:7, etc., it would be quite close also. However, someone seeking<br/>&gt; accurate 7-limit JI as opposed to commatic variants on Pythagorean<br/>&gt; intervals might say &quot;not close enough&quot; -- and it has been commented<br/>&gt; that even the tuning errors of conventional microtunable synthesizers<br/>&gt; (on the order of 1-2 cents) may be &quot;not good enough&quot; for JI at its<br/>&gt; most exacting</p><p>My experience so far, after noodling on a 29-note schismic keyboard, is that<br/>the 7-limit intervals only come into their own when the fifth is tempered very<br/>close to the point where the 7:4 becomes just.  I don&apos;t know exactly why this<br/>is, although it does represent the minimax temperament.  In the 7-limit, it&apos;s<br/>comparable to 1/4-comma meantone, but the improved fifths do make a difference.<br/> In the 9-limit it&apos;s that bit better.</p><p>With Pythagorean tuning, the 7-limit intervals are close enough to be 7-limit,<br/>but I find they don&apos;t really &quot;ring&quot; as consonances.   I don&apos;t know why this is:<br/>I prefer meantones with theoretically poorer approximations.  Something magic<br/>happened when the 7:4 became just, and it may be have been some kind of<br/>artifact.  I will investigate more sometime.</p><p>&gt; Thus your response to my comments on the septimal schisma may<br/>&gt; illustrate how we evaluate intervals based on such factors as musical<br/>&gt; setting and theoretical taste: this theme may be a very nontrivial one<br/>&gt; as the Tuning List provides an opportunity to discuss these diverse<br/>&gt; musics and tuning systems.</p><p>Yes, it is an interesting topic, and there does seem to be a cultural<br/>divergence.
