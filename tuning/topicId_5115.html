At the time, interest seemed muted, but lately it has picked<br/>up.  I&apos;ll describe briefly how to use the program now.</p><p>What it does: as you play, the program picks a tuning based upon the<br/>tuning file(s) you&apos;ve selected.  It considers each moment in time<br/>freshly, meaning that the tuning it picks now does not consider the<br/>tuning it picked in the recent (or not recent) past.</p><p>Who can run it?  You&apos;ve gotta have Windows 95/98, sorry!  I&apos;m not sure<br/>about NT; I don&apos;t have it and haven&apos;t heard if it works ok...</p><p>JI Relay is on my web site:</p><p>   <a href="http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/">http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/</a></p><p>It&apos;s at the bottom of the page.  Download the zip file, <a href="http://jix1000.zip">jix1000.zip</a>, and<br/>extract it ideally in some new, empty directory.  Run JIRelay.exe and<br/>start tuning!</p><p>This version only does real-time bending; my latest adaptive tuning<br/>experiments haven&apos;t been woven in yet.  It WILL do utonal tuning: take<br/>the file from TD 332.7 and name it just7u.tux (not just7.tux, as I<br/>accidentally advised in TD 332.7...).</p><p>You need a keyboard to provide MIDI input to the program.  And you need<br/>a GM (General MIDI) synth to receive the processed MIDI output from the<br/>program.  Most PC sound cards support GM to a sufficient degree.  If<br/>you use the same hardware for the keyboard input and synth output, you<br/>must turn local OFF, preventing key presses from directly generating<br/>sound, or else you&apos;ll hear out-of-tune duplicated notes!</p><p>Some of the options in the program:</p><p>   Send retune message every [] msec: less time smooths the retuning<br/>      transition but cloggs the MIDI stream<br/>   Retune transition time: how long it takes altogether for the tuning<br/>      to change in response to real-time keyboard manipulation.<br/>   Rebend note-off if on within: retuning on note-off alone often sounds<br/>      ugly, but if one or more note-on&apos;s has come just ahead, we&apos;re<br/>      still under the influence of that note-on.  Setting this number<br/>      high encourages retuning for note-off&apos;s.<br/>   GM patch: the voice (&quot;program&quot;) you&apos;re going to play.<br/>   MIDI port in: where the system finds your keyboard.<br/>   MIDI port out: where you want the system to play the tuned MIDI.<br/>   Tuning file(s) to use: select one or more.  with the program comes:<br/>      equal.tux: equal temperament<br/>      just1.tux: actually should be named just7.tux: 7-limit tuning.<br/>      just2.tux: attempts to include 13-limit tuning.<br/>      just5.tux: 5-limit - not included - see below.<br/>      just7.tux: rename just1.tux to just7.tux and you&apos;ve got 7-limit.<br/>      just7u.tux: get it from TD 332.7.<br/>   Filter out ChnPres: if checked, channel pressure is eaten, reducing<br/>      MIDI clog but potentially reducing expression.<br/>   Center tuning: if checked (recommended), the pitch bends will be<br/>      centered about zero, some up, some down.<br/>   Silent retuning: if checked (recommended), a note that has been<br/>      silent can sound with a new tuning, not have to bend gradually<br/>      from the pitch it last used in the past.</p><p>Here&apos;s a plausible just5.tux file:</p><p>#<br/># just5.tun<br/>#<br/># modification history:<br/>#    08-17-99 (jdl): new from just7.tun<br/>#<br/>#<br/>#<br/>#<br/># tuning:<br/># cols 1-8 have mbu for +/- 1 semitone voice; halve for +/- 2 (usual):<br/># (81.92 mbu/cent at this scale; 40.96 mbu/cent at +/- 2):<br/>#<br/>       0        # 0; the reference, &quot;C&quot;<br/>       0        # 1; has no known harmonic place in the scale...<br/>    +320        # 2; 9/8 of C<br/>   +1281        # 3; 6/5 of C<br/>   -1121        # 4; 5/4 of C<br/>    -160        # 5; 4/3 of C<br/>    -801        # 6; 15/16 of 7<br/>    +160        # 7; 3/2 of C<br/>   +1121        # 8; 4/5 of 12<br/>   -1281        # 9; 5/6 of C<br/>    -320        # A; 8/9 of C: that&apos;s what makes this 5-limit!<br/>    -961        # B; 15/16 of C</p><p># interval goodness:<br/># 6 as 15/16 of 7; 8 as 4/5 of 12:<br/># interval starting at:<br/>#    0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10    11<br/># interval 0:<br/>    +8   -16     0     0     0     0   -16     0   -16     0     0     0<br/># interval 1:<br/>   -16   -16    +8   -16    +8   -16     0   -16  -128   -16     0   +16<br/># interval 2:<br/>    +8   -32     0     0    -8    +8  -128     0  -128    +8     0   -32<br/># interval 3:<br/>     0   -32   -64   -16   +16    +8   -64    +4  -128    +8   -64    +8<br/># interval 4:<br/>   +32   -64     0   +16  -256   +16  -128   +24    +8   -64     0  -128<br/># interval 5:<br/>     0  -256    +8    -8     0  -256    -8   +16  -256  -256  -256     0<br/># interval 6 (must repeat indentical groups of 6):<br/>   -16   -32   -32   -32    +8   -16   -16   -32   -32   -32    +8   -16</p><p>JdL</p></div>
