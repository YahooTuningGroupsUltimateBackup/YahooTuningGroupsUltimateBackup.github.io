I am very slowly working on an<br/>oratorio using a 53-equal template, and I will be<br/>combining synthesized music, live musicians and<br/>singers. I agree with Johnny Reinhard that the &quot;cents&quot;<br/>system makes the most sense for the most applications,<br/>especially when live musicians are involved. And<br/>someday I hope to be able to compose and notate using<br/>that system on my computer. My opinion won&apos;t sway<br/>others, I&apos;m sure, but I just need a practical system<br/>of notation that can be understood by the greatest<br/>number of musicians.<br/>So here&apos;s a relatively simple question. I&apos;m still<br/>looking for a musical notation program which can do<br/>Reinhard-style &quot;cents&quot; notation, or at least which can<br/>be easily modified to do this. For example, I play<br/>MIDI track 2 MIDI note number 97 (my generalized<br/>keyboard has 288 notes, each individually<br/>programmable, so I need 3 MIDI tracks per musical<br/>line) and I want it to notate a C#+32 cents one octave<br/>above middle C or whatever. I have asked Sibelius if<br/>this can be done and they said no. Can Finale do this?<br/>Can ANY major notational program do this?<br/>I know a guy who claims he can do some serious<br/>programming in Cakewalk and achieve this, tho he<br/>admits Cakewalk is not as good a program in general<br/>for notation. If he did it, he might like to market it<br/>to microtonalists. That way I wouldn&apos;t have to pay<br/>thousands of dollars myself to get this notational<br/>system developed.<br/>So Johnny and others, before I accidentally set about<br/>reinventing the wheel, does such a program already<br/>exist, and if not, does anyone know which program<br/>could best accomplish this?<br/>Thanks to all,<br/>Chris Mohr, Denver</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>Yahoo!
