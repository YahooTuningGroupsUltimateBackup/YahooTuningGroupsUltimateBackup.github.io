Well, I only had 5 megs of space on Compuserve and, supposedly, on<br/>Tripod I have 50...</p><p>In addition, I will be able to host other tuning experiments on this<br/>site.</p><p>There was a suggestion that tuning experiments go up at John Starrett&apos;s<br/>&quot;Tuning Punks&quot; site, but, you know, that really is not the place for<br/>them...  John has COMPLETE PIECES there, not experiments.</p><p>Therefore, if anyone would like ME to host an experiment on Tripod, I<br/>will be more than willing to do so.  Just send me the file(s) you want<br/>posted with a little text, if you wish, and we&apos;ll throw up (not<br/>literally) a little HTML to go along with the file...</p><p>So, we can have a little laboratory of tuning, if anyone wishes and<br/>doesn&apos;t want to do it themselves.</p><p>Here is the address for the &quot;moved&quot; tuning experiment for &quot;Verklarte<br/>Neunzehn.&quot;  (I&apos;m still not getting it to &quot;stream&quot; yet...)</p><p><a href="http://jpehrson.tripod.com/tuning.html">http://jpehrson.tripod.com/tuning.html</a></p><p>Please send any audible files you wish for the new &quot;lab.&quot;</p><p>_____________ ______ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
