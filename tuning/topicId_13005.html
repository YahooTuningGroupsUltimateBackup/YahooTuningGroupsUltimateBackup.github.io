Szanto [<a href="mailto:JSZANTO@ADNC.COM">mailto:JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</a>]<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, September 18, 2000 11:05 PM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Mathematical proofs vs. musical proofs<br/>&gt; List,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In all these last months of endless postings of ratios, formulae, columns<br/>&gt; of numbers, and lattices, there has been one thing that usually bugged me<br/>&gt; (in the sense that I couldn&apos;t reconcile it with myself). It kind<br/>&gt; of came up<br/>&gt; when John dL wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;It would be really great to hear an actual piece, tuned in 7-limit, for<br/>&gt; &gt;which you say, &quot;This is good, IMO&quot;.  Does such a thing exist?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This was in response to Paul E., who replied that one of his<br/>&gt; pieces filled<br/>&gt; the bill. And here is the dilemma, at least for me:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can certainly understand (or at least be led to understand) a<br/>&gt; mathematical proof, or a logical proof, etc. What I cannot figure out is<br/>&gt; how a piece of music can stand as validation for a theory. And<br/>&gt; the greater<br/>&gt; problem for me, at least, is that I don&apos;t feel comfortable coming out and<br/>&gt; saying how bad a piece of music is. Errors can be found in calculations,<br/>&gt; things can be out of whack in an ASCII lattice diagram, even<br/>&gt; factual errors<br/>&gt; can creep into musicological research. All of this can, and very<br/>&gt; frequently<br/>&gt; is, corrected here on the list.</p><p>I can&apos;t think of a single piece of music, at least in the Western tradition,<br/>which &quot;stands as validation for a theory&quot;. Bach&apos;s Well-Tempered Clavier,<br/>Rameau&apos;s works based on his theory of harmony and some of Gershwin&apos;s works<br/>created with inspirations from Schillinger come close, but I don&apos;t think a<br/>theory of the type we&apos;re discussing here can be validated by pieces, any<br/>more than you can conclude that all swans are white simply because no one<br/>has ever seen one of another color.</p><p>On the other hand, I have no problem whatsoever declaring my own personal<br/>preferences for given pieces of music, composers and such. I am willing to<br/>listen to anything, as long as it does not exceed the volume levels where<br/>physical damage to my hearing apparatus is possible. But I am not willing to<br/>listen to music that I don&apos;t like more than once. What do I listen to many<br/>times? In the 20th century, Shostakovich, Hovhaness, Wuorinen, Dodge,<br/>Subotnick, Stockhausen, Gershwin and quite a few others.</p><p>&gt; But I&apos;m of a notion that you can put forth pretty much any system, any<br/>&gt; theory, any meta-method of applying these tunings to music, past,<br/>&gt; present,<br/>&gt; or future. You can do this, but that piece of music is completely<br/>&gt; unable to<br/>&gt; validate what you do unless it meets one undeniable condition:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would have to be a good piece of music.</p><p>To my taste, there are &quot;good pieces of music&quot; and great composers scattered<br/>throughout the history of Western music. Some of these composers were very<br/>much tuned in to the various mathematical theories of music and some were<br/>totally in ignorance of them. In the language of statistics, there does not<br/>seem to be any correlation between greatness of a composer&apos;s works and use,<br/>development or understanding of a mathematical theory of what is supposed to<br/>sound good. Moreover, many of the composers we recognize as great<br/>deliberately broke the rules -- some a little, some a whole bunch.</p><p>&gt; The more I listen to the various microtonal musics of the past 5 years,<br/>&gt; including commercial CDs, indie CDs, all the various compilation CDs, and<br/>&gt; now the various composers listed on the Tuning Punks site and<br/>&gt; elsewhere, I<br/>&gt; really am convinced: the ones that knock me out would probably be able to<br/>&gt; do it in 12tet, in some fashion or other; the ones that are lame,<br/>&gt; no tuning<br/>&gt; system ever or henceforth devised is going to rescue them.</p><p>Here I&apos;m going to have to part company with you. There are many things you<br/>can&apos;t do in 12-TET, quarter-tones and approximating closely some non-Western<br/>scales being two obvious examples. There are also things you can&apos;t do in<br/>microtonal music; the very definition implies a scale -- discrete notes --<br/>rather than, say, soundscapes. Microtonality is just one tool in a<br/>composer&apos;s bag of tricks. Easley Blackwood, for example, has written both<br/>microtonal and non-microtonal music.</p><p>Yes, there is a lot of music that sounds OK in 12-TET and maybe just a tad<br/>better in some alternate tuning. John DL has retuned a number of classical<br/>pieces and my fairly sensitive ear can&apos;t tell the difference between the<br/>retuned and the 12-TET versions.</p><p>&gt; I just don&apos;t get it. You can knock me for not getting it, maybe. But I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t been around this list as long as I have (soon to enter the fifth<br/>&gt; year) if I wasn&apos;t actually *interested* in what people were<br/>&gt; looking for in<br/>&gt; alternate tunings. I keep waiting for the beta period to end, and the<br/>&gt; incredible worlds of music, that only these new tunings can release, to<br/>&gt; come out.</p><p>How many professional string quartets are there? How many professional<br/>saxophone quartets are there? How much music has been written for string<br/>quartet? How much music has been written for saxophone quartet? I&apos;m sure<br/>there&apos;s an &quot;incredible world of music&quot; just waiting to be composed for the<br/>saxophone quartet :-). But I&apos;m not holding my breath waiting for it, nor am<br/>I looking for four saxophone players in the Portland area, nor am I<br/>composing for saxophone quartet. That&apos;s not my thing; I&apos;m not sure<br/>microtonality is my thing, either, to tell you the truth.</p><p>My thing is music produced by digital computers -- whether it&apos;s microtonal<br/>or soundscapes or found music from sounds of computers at work or computer<br/>renderings of classical works. If I could get a computer to compose music<br/>that I liked listening to, I&apos;d be doing that, too. Microtonality is one tool<br/>that is particularly suited to computers, or rather, difficult to do cheaply<br/>any other way. I view &quot;music theory&quot; as simply a way to rule out lots of<br/>garbage right at the start, without me having to listen to it. There is an<br/>infinite amount of possible music, and most of it is gonna suck wet dog fur.</p><p>One other note: if you *could* hear the theory in one of my pieces, I would<br/>interpret that as a failure of that piece as music -- as a whole Gestalt,<br/>greater than the sum of its parts. Beethoven&apos;s Ninth is the most popular<br/>piece of music in the Portland area. (I can&apos;t speak for the rest of the<br/>world :-). It is certainly greater than the deafness of the composer,<br/>greater than any conductor and orchestra who perform it, greater than<br/>Schiller&apos;s poetry and Beethoven&apos;s music, etc. And it is greater than the<br/>music theory of Beethoven&apos;s time and greater than his daring deviations from<br/>that theory! Sure, you can hear the &quot;theory of the symphony&quot; in Beethoven&apos;s<br/>Ninth, and knowing that theory brings something more to the piece. But if<br/>that was *all* there was, it wouldn&apos;t be the masterpiece it is.</p><p>I&apos;m certainly not attempting to create a work that magnificent on my little<br/>Toshiba Satellite, and I doubt if any of the other composers on this list<br/>are either. I&apos;d be happy with a nice little concerto for flute and computer<br/>that more than one flutist (me) would be willing to play :-). (I&apos;m actually<br/>more interested in Japanese scales and shakuhachi that a Western flute, but<br/>I can&apos;t play the shakuhachi yet.)</p><p>&gt; But I think I know why it hasn&apos;t happened.</p><p>Because the majority of us can&apos;t hear the difference between 12-TET and JI?<br/>Because composing good music is difficult? Because 12-TET has an<br/>overwhelming market share? All of the above?<br/>--<br/>M.

The only thing available to me was a pair of<br/>tape recorders, a home-built diode bridge ring modulator and a military<br/>surplus computer with a 3-bit DAC attached to the high-order 3 bits of the<br/>accumulator register (and wired backwards :-). I was in heaven with just<br/>this collection of gear, and also had the time to compose :-). I dreamed of<br/>fully-digital musical instruments, in a day when computer music was done on<br/>mainframes in large corporations by folks like Max Mathews. I dreamed of<br/>owning a computer powerful enough to compose with, in a day when you could<br/>get, if you knew someone, a PDP-8 for somewhere around 10 - 20K.

I went<br/>to a &quot;new music&quot; concert Saturday (<a href="http://www.nweamo.org/">http://www.nweamo.org/</a>) and while I<br/>*liked* what I heard, there was little difference between it and the<br/>&quot;electronic music&quot; of 25 years ago. There was nothing remotely resembling<br/>microtonal or xentonal music. Portland has not one but *two* &quot;new music&quot;<br/>ensembles, Third Angle New Music and Fear No Music.

Moreover, many of the composers we recognize as great<br/>&gt; deliberately broke the rules -- some a little, some a whole bunch.</p><p>Ah, but that&apos;s exactly what some of us here on the list are<br/>working so hard to find out: why could composers like Beethoven<br/>and Schoenberg, who broke so many &apos;rules&apos;, get away with it so<br/>forcefully?</p><p>The power of their musical logic indicates that there are some<br/>&apos;other rules&apos; lurking somewhere, and we want to figure out what<br/>they are!</p><p>To a great extent, this has been a successful endeavor regarding<br/>Schoenberg: lots of eminent theorists have written reams on how<br/>his voice-leading and harmony works, and have indeed formulated<br/>new &apos;rules&apos; based on his compositions and those of later atonalists<br/>and serialists.</p><p>I suggest that one reason theorists have had so much success in<br/>these cases is that they started with a given tuning system<br/>(12-tET) and are painstakingly exploring every possible facet<br/>of it.  Properties inherent in the tuning system itself are<br/>bound to shed light on some of the successful musical maneuvers<br/>the composers achieved in their pieces.</p><p>Wagner&apos;s music, which also broke tons of contemporary rules, has<br/>also spawned whole new schools of harmonic theory.  The case<br/>here (as far as tuning is concerned) is a bit more complicated,<br/>because I would argue that Wagner still retained many vestiges<br/>of tonal meaning/function in his harmonic practice, much of<br/>which depends on meantone or well-tempered tuning and 5-limit<br/>JI theory.</p><p>But the fact that the transition to pseudo-universal acceptance<br/>of 12-tET was already underway helps to elucidate his compositional<br/>gestures to a large extent, again because of the more recent<br/>discoveries about properties of 12-tET itself.</p><p>The case of Beethoven is considerably more complicated than that<br/>of Wagner, because his compositional gestures have a definite<br/>grounding in meantone/well-tempered tuning and 5-limit JI theory<br/>and in many cases exhibited a very modern (for its time)<br/>exploration of the properties of 12-tET.</p><p>IMO, Beethoven is the first great composer for 12-tET.  I realize<br/>that much of his earlier music was conceived with possibly<br/>meantone or more likely a well-temperament in mind, but his<br/>later works show many definite and deliberate manipulations of<br/>harmonic and, especially, modulatory techniques that only work<br/>well in 12-tET.</p><p>So in a nutshell, I&apos;d predict that a lot of the work that the<br/>theorists here on the Tuning List do will ultimately be applied<br/>by legions of later musicologists to masterworks and composers<br/>of the past, to uncover all kinds of aspects of the affective<br/>reaction to their music that have gone unnoticed due to the<br/>lack of recognition of an historical multitude of tunings.</p><p>&gt; ... Microtonality is one tool that is particularly suited to<br/>&gt; computers, or rather, difficult to do cheaply any other way.</p><p>Amen to that, mostly.  I&apos;d amend it (pun intended) by saying<br/>that microtonality can be done cheaply any way one sees fit<br/>to coerce it out of any sound-source (how about a 50-cent<br/>tin whistle?).</p><p>The computer makes it easy to do microtonality *accurately*<br/>- that&apos;s the big plus.</p><p>&gt; ... Sure, you can hear the &quot;theory of the symphony&quot; in<br/>&gt; Beethoven&apos;s Ninth, and knowing that theory brings something<br/>&gt; more to the piece. But if that was *all* there was, it<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t be the masterpiece it is.</p><p>There is *very* much in line with Schoenberg&apos;s dogged contention<br/>that there were some mysterious things about masterworks that<br/>defied analysis.</p><p>I don&apos;t buy it - guess I&apos;m just a firm believer in the ability<br/>of good analysis to eventually uncover all the secrets.<br/>It will probably just take too long for any of us too know<br/>about it.

The way a lot of algorithmic<br/>composition works is to generate lots of music more or less at random<br/>and apply a set of rules to the random output that select the music<br/>that conforms to certain desiderata. This is more or less what a<br/>genetic algorithm does, only GAs are a lot more efficient. Having some<br/>theory on the front end before the random generator<br/>to throw out stuff that is totally useless makes them even more<br/>efficient.</p><p>Got it. Though I think that the GA analogy, though helpful by design,<br/>is less than ideal (though I see no reason why it couldn&apos;t be every<br/>bit as potentially rewarding and whatnot) if overzealously applied to<br/>&quot;standard&quot; compositional practice... Stuckenschmidt&apos;s &quot;Twentieth<br/>Century Music&quot; makes some convincing points along these lines as<br/>regards Schillinger&apos;s theories.</p><p>BTW, your talking, err... singing, computer-at-work music sounds<br/>fascinating; are you familiar with &quot;nonlinear hotwiring&quot; as in the<br/>Qubais Reed Ghazala &quot;circuit-bending school&quot;?</p><p>  dan</p></div><h3><a id=13107 href="#13107">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2000 11:00:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;pehrson@p...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13091">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13091</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;inspiration&quot; or ability of a composer remains separate from<br/>&gt; this, and it&apos;s something that really can&apos;t be taught or learned...<br/>&gt; but how many composers with &quot;talent&quot; have &quot;IMPROVED&quot; their art<br/>&gt; through conscious study??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even Satie, finally, made a conscious and thorough study of<br/>&gt; counterpoint when he was in his 40s!!</p><p>Hmmm... but IMO, with the major exception of _Socrate_, the<br/>music Satie wrote after this wasn&apos;t as good as the stuff he<br/>wrote early in his career... or maybe it just wasn&apos;t as<br/>*original*; perhaps that&apos;s what I really like about the<br/>earlier work.</p><p>Don&apos;t get me wrong - I&apos;m a very big fan of Satie, and I find<br/>good and bad pieces sprinkled thru-out his whole career.

But alternative tunings<br/>have important features not shared by 12-TET, and if you look for it, it&apos;s<br/>possible to find good music that exploits these features. There may not be<br/>as much of it as we&apos;d like to find, but I&apos;ve found several that have<br/>convinced me that new systems of tuning are worth exploring. For instance,<br/>Easley Blackwood&apos;s microtonal etudes persuaded me that 12, 15, 19, and<br/>22-TET aren&apos;t the only relatively small equal scales that are musically<br/>useful and appealing.</p><p>I can imagine Wendy Carlos&apos; &quot;Afterlife&quot; retuned to 11-limit JI on a<br/>Chromelodeon, for instance, but 12-TET lacks the characteristic &quot;neutral<br/>seconds&quot; of 15-TET (within 5 cents of 11/10) that give this piece much of<br/>its unique flavor. I suspect that retuning it to 12-TET would radically<br/>change the character of both the harmonic and melodic elements. That&apos;s why<br/>I think it&apos;s a good example of serious non-12 music that works.</p><p>(On the other hand, Blackwood&apos;s etudes sometimes seem to go out of their<br/>way to sound as much like conventional 12-TET music as they can within the<br/>bounds of these exotic tunings, since he was exploring their similarities<br/>to the diatonic scale.

Which with he meant writing about music theory.</p><p>That is a very sad commentary.

He had to<br/>&gt; figure out what the harmonic properties of each tuning were, devise<br/>&gt; a notation for each, compose the music, and perform it, one track<br/>&gt; at a time, on a regular keyboard. This last point is not trivial.<br/>&gt; You know those rooms where the gravity throws you because the walls<br/>&gt; look square but are way off perpendicular? Try to imagine not twelve<br/>&gt; such rooms, but twelve such _cities_, all substantially different,<br/>&gt; i.e., disorienting in really different ways.
