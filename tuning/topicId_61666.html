Well, a microtonal<br/>flute-and-clarinet duo sounded like an exercise in futility - why go<br/>through the horror of microtones for only two lines, which would<br/>barely let you hear the in-tuneness of the intervals? So I added a<br/>virtual piano part (which will be played on keyboard sampler by Blair<br/>McMillan, who recently had a nice profile in the Times), a fretless<br/>bass ...&quot;</p><p>He didn&apos;t describe the tuning exactly, but mentioned 30 pitches per<br/>octave, so I imagine it is one of Kyle&apos;s JI pieces. The main point<br/>being that he is bringing his music to life with the resources he<br/>deems appropriate, and one can hardly argue with that.</p><p>If you check out his column, be sure to read some of the recent good<br/>posts on Charles Ives as well.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/2005 10:01:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry - wish Yahoo allowed one to edit their posts.
