If ever he accomplished this design, the work must obviously have been<br/>lost. Only some fragments were discovered in 1884 by D. Bierens de Haan in a<br/>collection of miscellaneous manuscripts, which belonged to Constantijn Huygens<br/>(1596-1687), the well-known secretary to the Princes of Orange, who, at the same<br/>time, was a gifted poet and musician. (Cf. this edition, Vol. I, p. 33, work<br/>XV).<br/>This collection, now in the possession of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie<br/>van Wetenschappen at Amsterdam, is preserved at the Koninklijke Bibliotheek at<br/>The Hague, The Netherlands.<br/>Stevin often divided his books into a main part, containing the established<br/>doctrine,<br/>and an appendix dealing with controversial matters, in order &quot;not to obscure the<br/>instruction by dispute&quot;, as he says. Accordingly we find two main parts, or<br/>sketches<br/>thereof, and two appendices. Neither of these treatises is complete, and in the<br/>plan they show an appreciable difference in the stress laid on certain points.<br/>One<br/>draft is in Stevin&apos;s own handwriting. It dwells rather more upon discussions<br/>than<br/>the other. This part will be reproduced hereafter. The other draft, which has<br/>been<br/>copied as if in preparation for print, indulges rather more in elementary<br/>defini-<br/>tions. It shows some gaps, presumably to be filled up later.<br/>Stevin used to open his books with a summary. In one of the drafts the main part<br/>and the appendix contain pages bearing the title cort begrijp (i.e. summary),<br/>but<br/>one of these pages is blank, and the other contains a dedication to the &quot;singing<br/>masters&apos; of his time and the statement that he will give his critical remarks in<br/> an<br/>appendix.<br/>Nowhere does Stevin use the word music. He always writes singing. Composers<br/>are called makers of singing. The stave is called singing ladder. Perhaps the<br/>word<br/>singconst, the art of singing, was the best translation into Dutch he could<br/>think of<br/>for musica. As is well known, Stevin was extremely keen in inventing and pro-<br/>pagating vernacular translations of Latin words (see Vol. I, p. 6 and p. 58). It<br/> is to<br/>the semantic power of the Dutch language in making a word express its meaning<br/>properly by means of its components, and to the lack of this power of the Greek<br/>language, that he ascribes the fact that the clever Greeks failed to find the<br/>correct<br/>solution of how properly to divide the string to suit the true musical scale,<br/>whereas<br/>he himself was able to offer this solution.<br/>For his reflections and conclusions Stevin based himself on &quot;natural singing&quot;<br/>(natuerlicke sanck), taking for granted that natural singing is an empirical<br/>fact<br/>liable to be observed with an amount of reasonable exactitude sufficient for all<br/>kinds of practical purposes. That, of course, is not rigid mathematical<br/>precision.<br/>The scale of natural singing shows five major steps and two minor steps. Stevin<br/>maintains that all major steps must be equal. So are the minor steps, each being<br/>one half of a major step. Thus, the sum of all steps in a &quot;round&quot; (ommeganck;<br/>we call it octave) amounts to six major steps. The major steps are whole tones,<br/>the minor steps are semitones.<br/>With this statement Stevin took sides in the controversy on the problem of how<br/>to place frets on the fingerboard of a stringed instrument in order to ensure<br/>the<br/>correct intervals. The problem arises from the recognition that two fundamental<br/>intervals are equally important, but at the same time clash owing to their<br/>mutual<br/>incommensurability. These concordant intervals are commonly called the perfect<br/>fifth and the perfect major third. Though a certain amount of musical training<br/>will be helpful in understanding the nature of the difficulty, the general<br/>reader<br/>might grasp the point at issue as follows, if he does not mind being confronted<br/>with figures.<br/>It is quite natural to divide a string of a lute, between neck and bridge, into<br/>two<br/>equal parts, and to listen ta the sounds produced. Again, it is natural to<br/>divide<br/>the halves into two. It is also natural to divide the string into three equal<br/>parts,<br/>and again each third part into two, and into three. Thus, taking the whole<br/>length<br/>to have 144 parts, we get a division at the numbers<br/>144  128  120  112  108  96  80  72  64  48  36  32  24  16<br/>For shorter parts of the string we get higher notes.<br/>We place frets on the fingerboard according to this division. By pressing down<br/>the string on these frets, we can easily produce the notes required.<br/>We may use the numbers given to designate the notes thus produced. Actually,<br/>however, people have agreed to call them by letters, e.g. the following<br/>A  B  c  .  d  e  g  a  b  e&apos;  a&apos;  b&apos;  e&quot;  b&quot;<br/>The note 112 was not included in the ancient lettered system. For our purpose we<br/>may ignore it.<br/>The most important relation is the interval between the notes corresponding to<br/>a certain length of string and its half. Such notes are designated by the same<br/>letters, as A and a (144 : 72), or a and a&apos; (72 : 36); as B and b (128 : 64), or<br/> b and<br/>b&apos; (64 : 32) and b&apos; and b&quot; (32 : 16); again e and e&apos; (96 : 48), or e&apos; and e&quot; (48<br/> : 24).<br/>Their relation, their interval (2 : 1), is called an octave.<br/>Next comes the so-called interval of the perfect fifth, 3 : 2, as between A and<br/>e,<br/>e and b, c and g, d and a, a and e&apos;. Then follows the interval of the perfect<br/>fourth,<br/>4 : 3, as between A and d, d and g, B and e, e and a, b and e&apos;, e&apos; and a&apos;, b&apos;<br/>and e&quot;.<br/>There are the intervals of the major third, 5 : 4, as between c and e, g and b.</p><p>For the technique of playing it is desirable that the fingers should not have to<br/>reach out far from the neck to the smaller numbers. For that reason a second<br/>string will be provided, with the same length as the first, a lighter one which<br/>at<br/>full length produces the note 108, which we called d. The second string at full<br/>length producing the note 108, the frets will produce notes corresponding to<br/>numbers proportionally reduced in the ratio 3/4. Here they are.<br/>108  96  90  81  72  60  54  48  36  27  24  18  12<br/>The names by letters will be<br/>d  e  f  g  a  c&apos;  d&apos;  e&apos;  a&apos;  d&quot;  e&quot;  a&quot;  e&apos;&quot;<br/>There is a gain. A new note represented by a new letter, f. But there is a clash<br/>also. The fret number 108, producing by the first string a note d, is now pro-<br/>ducing a note g = 81, which cannot be the same note as g = 80 played on the<br/>first string.<br/>Using a third string, which at full length produces the note 81 = g, again<br/>there appears a new note, but we find more clashes, as is seen from the<br/>table below of the notes given by numbers and by letters.<br/>                 Table<br/>144  128  120  108  96  80  72  64  48  36   32  24  16<br/>108   96   90   81  72  6O  54  48  36  27   24  18  12<br/> 81   72 67.5 6O.75 54  45 40.5 36  27 20.25 18 13.5  9<br/> A     B   c    d    e   g  a    b  e&apos;  a&apos;    b&apos; e&quot;   b&quot;<br/> d     e   f    g    a   c&apos; d&apos;  e&apos;  a&apos;  d&quot;    e&quot; a&quot;   e&apos;&quot;<br/> g     a b-flat c&apos;   d&apos;  f&apos; g&apos;  a&apos;  d&quot;  g&quot;    a&quot; d&quot;&apos;  a&quot;&apos;<br/>There is a note c&apos; = 6O 3/4 clashing with c&apos; = 6O and c = 120 on the second<br/>and first strings. There are notes g&apos; = 40 1/2 and g&quot; = 20 1/4 on the third<br/>string<br/>clashing with g = 80 on che first string.<br/>These clashes constitute a very serious difficulty in playing on a lute tuned in<br/>this way. The error 81 : 80 is called a &quot;comma&quot;.<br/>J. Murray Barbour, in his book on Tuning and Temperament (Michigan State<br/>College Press, 1953), presents a historical survey of the attempts to find a<br/>satis-<br/>factory solution for the problem how to improve the placing of the frets. His<br/>book contains an ancient explanatory picture of a lute, by Gassani, indicating<br/>the<br/>places of the frets.<br/>It shows a division equivalent to the division given above, making in numbers<br/>         72    64 6O    54    48       40    36<br/>Gassani adds some more, filling up gaps<br/>         72 68 64 6O 57 54 51 48 45    40    36<br/>We can fill up the whole tones 45 : 40 : 36 in this way:<br/>                                 45 42 40 38 36<br/>We now see three series of semitones<br/>72 : 68 : 64 : 6O = 18 : 17 : 16 : 15<br/>6O : 57 : 54 : 51 : 48 : 45 : 42 = 20 : 19 : 18 : 17 : 16 : 15 : 14<br/>42 : 40 : 38 : 36 (: 34 : 32 : 30) = 21 : 20 : 19 : 18 (: 17 : 16 : 15)<br/>I continued the last series beyond 36 as a repetition of the first, lower<br/>series.<br/>There is a continuous range of semitones with the values 14 : 15 : 16 : 17 : 18<br/>:<br/>19 : 20 : 21, from major semitones 14 : 15 to minor semitones 20 : 21.<br/>Vincenzo Galilei (Dialogo della musica antica e moderna, Firenze, 1581)<br/>disclaim-<br/>ed such a variety of semitones. Before Stevin, he wanted them all to be equal,<br/>and he chose the value 17 : 18, which happens to be midway. For the fifth, seven<br/>such semitones added would make 18^7 : 17^7, about 6.12 : 4.10 (canceling 10^8),<br/>a rather good approximation to 6.15 : 4.10 = 3 : 2. The defect is 3 in 615, or<br/>1 in 205.<br/>For the major third, four such semitones would make 18^4 : 17^4 = about<br/>10.50 : 8.35 (canceling 10^4). This is a poorer approximation to the accepted<br/>value<br/>5 : 4 = 10.50 : 8.40. The excess is about 5 in 840, or 1 in 168.<br/>Now the octave, when taken to consist of twelve such semitones, turns out to be<br/>18^12 : 17^12, approximately 11.57 : 5.83 instead of 11.66 : 5.83 = 2 : 1. The<br/>defect<br/>is 9 in nearly 1170, all but 1 in 130. It is three fifths (and in the opposite<br/>sense)<br/>of the comma excess of 1 in 80 in the values 81 and 80, 60 3/4 and 60, noted<br/>earlier.<br/>The equal temperament by semitones 17 : 18 distributes the error of the comma<br/>over the octave (-3/5 c), the fifth (-2/5 c) and the major third (+1/2 c).<br/>Vincenzo Galilei&apos;s rule seems to have been commonly accepted at the end of the<br/>sixteenth century, as it is to this day, but only for the lute, the viol, and<br/>similar<br/>instruments.</p><p>For organs and for harpsichords no attempt was made to divide the octave into<br/>twelve equal steps. Organists tried to have pure octaves and perfect major<br/>thirds<br/>by a slight adjustment of the fifth. They corrected the sequence of four fifths<br/>486 : 324 : 216 : 144 : 96<br/>so as to have perfect consonance between 480 and 96, because<br/>480 : 96 = 5 : 1.<br/>The comma excess 486 : 480 = 81 : 80 is distributed over the four steps, each<br/>step losing one fourth of a comma, i.e. 1 in 320, as follows (approximately):<br/>480 : 321 : 214 2/3 : 143 5/9 : 96.<br/>In order to have perfect major thirds (as between 480 = 5 X 96 and 384 =<br/>4 X 96), a small infringement is thereby made of the perfect fifths.<br/>Barbour (l.c., p. 26) gives the credit for the first description of this method<br/>of<br/>tuning to Pietro Aron (Toscanello in musica, Venice, 1523). It is the mean-tone<br/>temperament, strongly advocated by Gioseffo Zarlino (1517-1590; Stevin occa-<br/>sionally calls him Meester Sarlijn) and by Francesco Salinas (1577), two great<br/>early legislators of music. It has been in use for three centuries.</p><p>Stevin boldly did away with all these subtleties. In his view, all semitones had<br/> to<br/>be equal. In this he agreed with Vincenzo Galilei, that dissenting pupil of Zar-<br/>lino.<br/>He rejects any relationship between concordant intervals and ratios of integer<br/>numbers. For him the numbers resulting from the division of the ratio 2 : 1 into<br/>twelve equal ratios, twelve times the twelfth root of 2, are the true numbers.<br/>Barbour&apos;s remark is very appropriate (l.o., p. 7) : &quot;In his days only a<br/>mathematician<br/>(and perhaps only a mathematician not fully cognizant of contemporary musical<br/>practice) could have made such a statement.&quot; Barbour adds: &quot;It is refreshingly<br/>modern, agreeing completely with the views of advanced theorists and composers<br/>of our day.&quot; 1) It is Stevin&apos;s outstanding achievement that he produced the<br/>exact<br/>proportional numbers, between 10 000 and 5 000, in four figures, representing<br/>the steps of twelve semitones in the octave leading from 1 to 1/2. He was able<br/>to do so, referring to his French work on arithmetic (1585, this ed. Vol.II. B)<br/>where he had shown that the requirement of twelve equal ratios leading from<br/>2 to 1 involves the twelfth root of 2. By combining the operations of computing<br/>two square roots and subsequently a cube root, he finds for the twelfth root of<br/>2 the ratio 10 000 : 9 438 = 1.0595 : 1. The more exact figure is 1.059463 . . .<br/> . .<br/>Stevin never mentions the approximate value 18/17, familiar to makers of lutes,<br/>who used it in fixing frets on the fingerboards.<br/>He had no bump for the plain simplicity of small integer numbers. In his<br/>treatise<br/>on arithmetic (Work V) he had explained that there are &quot;no absurd, irrational</p><p>(footnote)<br/>1) The present editor believes that Stevin&apos;s duodecimal division of the octave<br/>i5<br/>now going to be superseded by the division into 31 steps, advocated by Nicola<br/>Vicen-<br/>tino (1588) and Christiaan Huygens (1691).<br/>irregular, inexplicable, or surd numbers&quot; (see this edition, VoI.II B, p. 532,<br/>also<br/>Vol. I, p. 23).</p><p>For him a number like 2^7/12 is as good as any other, say 3/2. If anybody should<br/>doubt that the sweet consonance of the fifth could be compatible with so compli-<br/>cated a number, then, says Stevin, rather haughtily and aggressively, he is not<br/>going to take pains to correct the inexplicable irrationality and absurdity of<br/>such<br/>a misapprehension. He repudiates the Pythagorean values for the intervals (3/2<br/>for the fifth, 9/8 for the second, 81/64 for the major third, 4/3 for the<br/>fourth) on<br/>the ground that they lead up to the ratio 256/243 for a semitone (the minor<br/>limma).<br/>This, when subtracted from a whole tone (9/8), leaves another semitone with a<br/>ratio very close to 256/240. Stevin remarks that this major semitone is all but<br/>a quarter larger than the previous minor semitone (the differences of 243<br/>and 240 from 256 being 13 and 16 respectively). All semitones having to<br/>be equal, the initial assumption of 3/2 for the ratio of the fifth must be<br/>wrong.<br/>For Stevin the equality of the twelve semitones follows from the fact that in<br/>tuning a harpsichord one obtains a closed cycle of fifths and fourths. Strictly<br/>speaking, the excess of twelve fifths over seven octaves should be 1 part in 73<br/>(comma of Pythagoras). Stevin, however, ascribes any small deviations from the<br/>perfect cycle to unavoidable experimental errors.</p><p>Joseph Needham, in Vol.4, Part 1, of his Science and Civilisation in China,<br/>refers<br/>to the duodecimal equal temperament as &quot;the princely gift of Chu Tsai-Yu&quot;. He<br/>points out that at the end of the l6th century there was a great flow of Chinese<br/>information into Europe. He urges the probability of some idea of Chu Tsai-Y&apos;u&apos;s<br/>solution having floated towards Stevin&apos;s mind. Stevin himself refers to Prop. 45<br/> in<br/>his book on arithmetic as the source of his method for finding the 12 equal<br/>semi-<br/>tones, ascribing his success to the wonderful semantic power of his Dutch lan-<br/>guage. He could not have said so, if he had to admit that a Chinese had been<br/>able to find the formula without Dutch words. The book of Chu Tsai-Yu quoted<br/>by Needham is dated 1584. Stevin&apos;s book on arithmetic appeared in 1585. We<br/>can agree with Needham saying &quot;the name of the inventor is of less importance<br/>than the fact of invention.&quot; As far as we know Stevin, we can apply to him the<br/>very same words of praise which Needham gives to Chu Tsai-Yu: &quot;Stevin him-<br/>self would certainly have been the first to give another investigator his due,<br/>and<br/>the last to quarrel over claims of precedence&quot;.</p><p>There is the ancient problem, come down from the Greeks, as to whatsoever<br/>sounds may have to do with numbers. In Stevin&apos;s time people had no clear con-<br/>sciousness of the frequenry of vibrations. He speaks of &quot;coarseness&quot; or<br/>&quot;fineness&apos;<br/>determining pitch, and postulates a proportionaliry of this coarseness to the<br/>length<br/>of the sound-producing part of a string. By way of example, he refers to the<br/>half, to the quarter, and to the eighth part of a string only. He does not<br/>mention<br/>other aliquot parts, or 2/3, or 3/4 of a string as examples. In this he shows a<br/>bias<br/>against integer numbers. Two is the only integer admitted by him in music. One<br/>would not have expected such a bias in a mind which knew quite well that the<br/>regular solids exhibit only selected integers in the number of their faces,<br/>edges,<br/>and angular points. Perhaps he would have admitted that consonant intervals,<br/>and their beauty, primarily have to do with integer numbers if he could have<br/>seen<br/>Lissajous&apos; delightful figures of interfering oscillations. He never mentions the<br/>phenomenon of beats, so essential for tuning perfect concords. Stevin never<br/>veri-<br/>fied whether on a harpsichord tuned with a closed cycle of fifths and fourths<br/>the<br/>thirds and sixths would turn out to be concords. They certainly would not!<br/>Never-<br/>theless he takes the consonance of these intervals for granted as an empirical<br/>fact.<br/>He decides rather by definition which intervals are good and which are bad.</p><p>As a practical rule, the &quot;singing masters&quot; condemned the interval of the fourth<br/>in polyphonic singing. This interdiction is not recognized by Stevin. He argues<br/>that very often, when one hears two instruments, a and b, playing in unison, it<br/>is<br/>very difficult to know whether they are playing at the same pitch or one octave<br/>apart. If a third instrument, c, plays in consonance with both, then of course<br/>it is<br/>in consonance with each of them. In case the concord seems to be that of a fifth<br/>it is difficult for the ear to decide whether c makes a fifth with both a and b,<br/> or<br/>with one of them only, making a fourth with the other. But, this being so, the<br/>fourth must be a good concord too.<br/>Stevin refuses to recognize a difference in singing with a flat on the stave or<br/>without (mollaris and duralis). He says that by transposition every tune can be<br/>written on the stave without a flat. In this he is right. Of course this has<br/>nothing<br/>to do with the difference in mode, with minor and major scales. There is no<br/>chapter on this subject of modes, but we have collected some scattered data.<br/>Sometimes, in the scale the note si is flattened by a semitone to sa. Stevin<br/>seems<br/>to have seen a reason for giving sa a place on the stave without the sign for a<br/>flat. It is curious to see that in certain diagrams he assigns the vocables<br/>   ut  re  mi  fa  sol  la  sa  ut<br/>to the letters<br/>   g   a   b   c   d    e   f   g<br/>If he had assimilated ut to c, as we do, of course sa would have meant b-flat,<br/>and<br/>si would have to be b-natural (the Germans would say b and h, respectively). In<br/>one place Stevin promises to return to this question of sa and si, but no<br/>chapter<br/>on this question is included. In the manuscript there is no consistent notation<br/>of<br/>sa and si on the stave.</p><p>We do not know whether Stevin ever considered his work to have been brought<br/>to a satisfactory conclusion, and whether he intended to publish it. It might<br/>well<br/>be that discussions with musicians made him change his mind in some respect<br/>Among the manuscripts of Constantijn Huygens mentioned above, published<br/>as an appendix to Stevin&apos;s Singconst (listed as Work XV in Vol. I of this<br/>edition,<br/>p. 33), there is a letter to Stevin from Abraham Verheyen, organist at Nijmegen<br/>(Gelderland), who urges that experiment, in tuning a harpsichord, shows that the<br/>three major thirds, i.e. six whole tones, do not make an octave. He explains to<br/>Stevin the merits of the current mean-tone temperament, and how to compute the<br/>ratios involved. Verheyen also produces an example of a song in two parts,<br/>clearly<br/>showing the difference of major and minor semitones. We know that Isaac<br/>Beekman (1588-1637, Journal, ed. C. De Waard, The Hague, 1942, Vol. 4, p. 157)<br/>at first very much admired Stevin&apos;s proportional division of the octave. Later<br/>he<br/>rejected it.<br/>Maybe the criticisms of very able friends shook Stevin&apos;s sturdy conviction a<br/>little,<br/>so that he abandoned the idea of making a full size treatise based on his<br/>mathemat-<br/>ical axiom.</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div>
