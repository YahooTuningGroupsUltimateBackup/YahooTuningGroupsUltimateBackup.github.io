The first is the beginning of a tune in TOP blackwood[10] (a TOP-tuned version of Easley Blackwood&apos;s decatonic scale), which abruptly cuts off after 30 seconds.</p><p>period 239.1786927 cents, generator 83.83059859 cents<br/>wedgie: &lt;&lt;0, 5, 0, 8, 0, -14]]<br/>map: [[5, 8, 12, 14], [0, 0, -1, 0]]</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/pilina.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/pilina.mid</a></p><p>I also recorded a bit of improvisation with the father[8] scale, with much of the melodic material derived from the 5-note &quot;anti-pentatonic&quot; MOS, which I&apos;m calling &quot;yemet veriko&quot;.</p><p>period 1185.869125 cents, generator 447.3863410 cents<br/>wedgie: &lt;&lt;1, -1, 3, -4, 2, 10]]<br/>map: [[1, 2, 2, 4]], [0, -1, 1, -3]]</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/yulung.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/yulung.mid</a></p><p>I did this by putting the notes of the Yemet Veriko scale on the white keys, and the extra three notes on black keys. So I had some degree of control over whether I was hitting one of the basic scale notes or a &quot;chromatic&quot; extra note. I added the harp part later to fill in some of the gaps and make it sound more like a deliberate composition. I don&apos;t often record improvisations, but I think this one turned out better than I was expecting.</p><p>(It never occurred to me when I was recording this last night that &quot;father&quot; temperament would be especially appropriate for Father&apos;s Day. It&apos;s just a nice coincidence!)</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2004 11:53:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I&apos;ve got a couple of new fragments of Zireen music on my web page<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/zireen-music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/zireen-music.html</a>).</p><p>Hi Herman,</p><p>Are any of these new since you put up this page?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2004 6:57:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve got a couple of new fragments of Zireen music on my web page &gt;&gt;(<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/zireen-music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/zireen-music.html</a>).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Herman,<br/>&gt; &gt; Are any of these new since you put up this page?</p><p>I believe only the last two (Father and Blackwood) are new.

You should try using softer mallets. :-) That&apos;s the problem with MIDI, of course; no two systems sound the same. At least you&apos;ve got a nice string patch; none of the ones on this generic sound card I have are any good. (I suppose I should get a new one some day; I almost think I was better off with the AWE32, at least I could make SoundFonts for it.)</p><p>&gt; I think I asked about this before, but I suppose I&apos;d better check if<br/>&gt; it is (still) OK, so consider this checking.</p><p>Sure, I don&apos;t mind.</p></div>
