There are 14<br/>possible notes within 7 frets. If you have a good enough ear, like Ravi<br/>Shankar or Jimi Hendrix, there are 21 steps within those 7 frets. Your<br/>guitar will sound more vocal if you play this way.&quot; I think that&apos;s<br/>mighty hip for way back then...check out his playing on &quot;East-West&quot; by<br/>the Butterfield Band...one of the great rock guitar solos....Hstick</p></div>
