By now I&apos;ve shown that many, many important JI scales<br/>&gt;are periodicity blocks.</p><p>Which only makes it obvious that it is possible to both extend and evaluate<br/>more fully someone else&apos;s explorations in a &apos;new&apos; area. I don&apos;t know that<br/>Partch had any forays into periodicity blocks, or would have had need to.<br/>My point is that the system worked well enough for him to not only develop<br/>an entire body of work (that continues to inspire), but kick-start an<br/>interest that continues to this day, on this list and elsewhere.</p><p>Twice you&apos;ve used the phrase &quot;I&apos;ve shown&quot;. To influence my little life, it<br/>would have to go further to &quot;I&apos;ve written/composed, and here it is to<br/>listen to.&quot; Then it would have value. However, to others, I *know* that all<br/>of these calculations are of value, just not for me (at this time).</p><p>&gt;Jon, all JI scales involve a sort-of-arbitrary decision of where to stop.<br/>&gt;What I&apos;ve shown is</p><p>There it is again...</p><p>&gt;The guy with the garden hose is one of the best microtonal composers I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;ever heard, Randy Winchester. Have you heard his music? Anyway, very funny,<br/>&gt;so what&apos;s your point?</p><p>No I haven&apos;t, but will seek out the resources on your recommendation (also,<br/>if there are cd&apos;s, mp3&apos;s, etc. I&apos;ll be happy to listen...).</p><p>The point? Ivory-tower spread-sheet-isms are fine for a lot of people, and<br/>ground-breaking research is ever more important as the future dawns. It is<br/>quite hilarious though, IMHO, when it is demonstrated by random hosings.<br/>Show us magnum opuses (opii?) based entirely on periodicity-block<br/>constructs! World-changing artworks in minimal pain fabrics!</p><p>People blowing party favors in some ET? A large break giveth us...</p><p>And to all, a good night.<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>    Jonathan M.

I like (and like to play) a full range of emotion in music,<br/>&gt;ranging from austere serenity to chaotic insanity.</p><p>Agreed absolutely: chaos and insanity are highly approved of. I just also<br/>thought I remembered that you were playing 22tet gtr/kbd in that example<br/>and thought something was not clear to me. Turns out I wasn&apos;t missing anything.</p><p>&gt;  Listen to my piece on the<br/>&gt;Tuning Punks site for a more serious &quot;demonstration&quot;, in that case, how the<br/>&gt;steps of 22-tET can take on a convincing harmonic logic.</p><p>I have. I guess it just deepens my belief that in spite of empirical<br/>evidence, screenfuls of matices, blind listening tests, or historical<br/>documentation (or refutation), it is all still a matter of ...</p><p>... personal taste.</p><p>Everything that everyone is doing here is a matter of taste. I&apos;ve listened<br/>to every one of the Tuning Punks clips, and like all the other music I&apos;ve<br/>ever heard, it is a spectrum from the wonderful to the hum-drum to the Esc<br/>key. As is usually the case, the tools never make or break the task, merely<br/>make it easier to craft an angel or polish a turd.</p><p>Maybe that is why this list is so difficult at times, so infuriating, and<br/>(at the same time) so difficult for me to leave: because it isn&apos;t just<br/>about music, or it isn&apos;t just about tunings, or one single area of *any*<br/>thing. It is about the interconnectedness of all of it; some make the<br/>synergy happen, some work in one side area exclusively.</p><p>To those crafting the paints, sharpening the chisels, calculating the<br/>comma-shifts, continue.</p><p>To those painting the canvases, sculpting the stone, turning the tunings<br/>into tunes, continue.</p><p>To those doing both, yessssssss.</p><p>See you in 00.<br/>Jon</p></div>
