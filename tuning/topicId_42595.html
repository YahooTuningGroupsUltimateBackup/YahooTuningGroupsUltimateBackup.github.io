This has a major beat<br/>ratio &quot;b&quot; of about -3/2, and a minor beat ratio &quot;c&quot; of about -1;<br/>where if f, t, m are the fifth, major third and minor third respectively, then b = (6t-5f)/(4t-5) and c = (5m-6)/(5m-4f) =<br/>b/f. If we take the average of the fifth we get from b=-3/2 with the fifth we get from -1, we get a fifth (algebraic of degree 16) which is<br/>indistinguishable from 2/7-comma meantone, differing by<br/>1.9729 x 10^(-7) cents. Even the sternest advocate of exact tuning might be willing to concede there is no discernable difference between this and 2/7-comma. Incidentally, it is in terms of the minor triads, not the major ones, that 2/7-comma meantone really stands out,<br/>with all of its beat rations the same.</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>2/28/2003 3:23:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul wrote:<br/>&gt;again, it seems to me that if one wants to achieve as much beat<br/>&gt;synchrony as possible, one would base one&apos;s tuning system on the<br/>&gt;overtone series of a &quot;subsonic&quot; fundamental which would be the lowest-<br/>&gt;common-denominator beat rate.</p><p>I don&apos;t see how this can be done without losing a major<br/>portion of the equal beating relationships.</p><p>&gt;btw, this does not agree with the meta-meantone given in the scala<br/>&gt;archives:</p><p>I seem to remember that meta-meantone is Erv&apos;s term for equal<br/>beating meantones, so there isn&apos;t a single one.
