Ok, what you need to look at (or probably know already but are a bit rusty), is modulus and indices maths. Under the standard 12 edo system the intervals are 2^(x/12) where x = ,0,1,2,3,...11 and the modulus maths comes from the usual math&apos;l properties of indices found in calculus books. For eg, since multiplying or dividing intervals is the same as adding or subtracting the indices, then 2^(x/12) x 2^(y/12) = 2^((x+y)/12) etc...The mod numbers x = 0,1,2,...11 are simply an abbreviation of the indices, which we add and subtract. Other basic info is that 2^(0/12) = 2^0 = 1, our base frequency, 2^(12/12) = 2^1 = 2 the 8ve, and both are set equal to 0 in mod(12). The inverse is 1/[2^(x/12)] = 2^-(x/12) which gives you the same number of semitones down, or it can be obtained by subtracting from the number from 12 eg;  4(the maj3rd), is  inverse to 8 (min6th) and vice-versa. For values x greater than 12 (our mod), we divide by that mod to get a number N+r where N is whole and r is the remainder, and x = r x 12 (mod 12). eg, x=14, x/12 = 1.16666...and 12 x 0.16666...= 2, so that 14 = 2 (mod 12). I think that&apos;s about it really.</p><p>So by reasoning backwards, what I found was that setting up mod 36 (which btw includes mod 12 since 3x12=36) then the interval 2^(25/36) gives a very good phi. Its inverse is 2^-(25/36)= 0.61797, squaring gives (2^(25/36))^2 = 2^(50/36) = 2.618. (Note, 2^(11/36)is an 8ve above the inverse i.e. dividing by 2 gives 2^(11/36).2^-1 = 2^-(25/36).) So in answer to your questions, first, x = 0,1,2,3,...a whole number and second, I got 75 because it is a multiple of 25. To bring it back into one octave we have 75/36 = 2.083333 and 0.083333 x 36 = 3. Oh and regarding what you say below, it does hit the 8ve exactly, while the fifth is the usual tempered one in 12 edo.<br/>I suppose the most logical first test would be taking the intervals at both sides of 1, that is 2^-(25/36):1:2^(25/36). Love to hear it so don&apos;t forget to send it to me.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Rick</p><p>&gt;    The only way to know for sure what I think of this system, of course, is to test it by ears.  Although I will say, I am very impressed you managed to hit both the 1.618034 and 0.618034 &quot;PHI-taves&quot; very close to perfectly with this system...and could possibly help hit the 2/1 octave and &quot;2 and a 5th&quot; tri-tave almost  dead on thus providing some extra clean sounding JI-style interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    So what values would/should I use for x?  Once I know this I can generate the scale and try it... :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- On Wed, 4/22/09, rick_ballan &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: rick_ballan &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: PHI interval tuning (for Michael S)<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Date: Wednesday, April 22, 2009, 8:55 AM<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       --- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Michael,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know if this is old news but I was thinking of how to resolve PHI with octave equivalence and came up with the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2^x = 1.618 (close enough)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; x = log1.618/log2 = 0.6942...which is close to 25/36 (= 0.694444)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i.e. 2^(25/36) = 1.61826115, close enough for jazz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Given that the ear can&apos;t determine past a few decimal places, this has all of the usual properties of PHI: its inverse is 2^(-25/36)= 0.61794..i.e. equal to itself minus 1, and squaring gives (2^(25/36))^ 2 = 2.61876..., itself plus 1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But the advantage of this approach might be that it implies a 36 tet system, base intervals 2^(1/36).

In the first paragraph I&apos;m just using the familiar 12 edo i.e. mod 12, to summarize the usual maths. But the tuning system I am now proposing is a 36 edo and therefore a 36 mod. So your sentence above should read &quot;So 75 is the &quot;value&quot; and, since it is greater than 36 etc...&quot;, not &quot;greater than 12&quot;. Everything else you did is correct. So we now have 36 notes equally distributed within the octave, where 2^(1/36) is our new smallest interval(it is now called &quot;1&quot;, whereas in mod 12 the semitone is called 1). We name the notes 0,1,2,3,...35 and then start over again. Since 2^(3/36) = 2^(1/12) we see that we reach a conventional semitone every third note i.e. the semitone is now called &quot;3&quot;; the 12 edo system is now 0,3,6,9,...33. This system therefore includes the 12 edo system and ipso facto all of the usual harmony if we wish. In other words, it is not necessarily just a Phi scale. Nevertheless, we CAN arrive at this semitone &quot;3&quot; via Phi also. Since 25 is our new phi, then 50 is phi squared, 75 phi cubed, and so on. But because 50 and 75 exceed 36, they are replaced by 14 and 3 respectively.</p><p>&gt;     Regardless...2^(-25/36) and 2^(25/36) sound fine. Your suggestion of 2^(21/36) does indeed make a very normal sounding fifth (virtually the same as in 12TET).  Also 2^(11/36) AKA 1.23589 sounds very very good between 1 and PHI as a<br/>&gt;  triad.  And, of course, 2^(36/36) is the standard octave.</p><p>In light of what I just said you can now see that (21/36) = (7/12) and is exactly the same interval as in 12 tet i.e. 21 = 3 x 7. And both 11 and 25 are the two generating phi intervals so interesting to hear they sound good (love to hear them together and successively).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I am still not so sure how you figure out which number to use to get the other notes (now that I&apos;ve used 11/36,21/36,25/36, and 36/36)...and a 4 note per octave scale seems a bit shallow).</p><p>So this should be clear now?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    However, I have found 2^(20/36) AKA 1.46973 and 2^(7/36) AKA 1.144283 and 1.38724 AKA 2^(17/36)  (notes derived from estimated of notes found in my own experiments) can combine with your notes to form probably the best sounding PHI scale I&apos;ve heard yet:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1<br/>&gt; 1.144283 2^(7/36)<br/>&gt; 1.23589 2^(11/36)<br/>&gt; 1.38724 2^(17/36)<br/>&gt; 1.46973 2^(20/36)<br/>&gt; 1.61826 2^(25/36)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    This is a very convenient coincidence because my latest PHI scale turned out to be:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1<br/>&gt; 1.1459<br/>&gt; 1.23606<br/>&gt; 1.3819<br/>&gt; 1.47214<br/>&gt; 1.618034<br/>&gt; (so numerically close it&apos;s almost scary :-) )</p><p>Yep, love that about maths. I love to see unexpected things working once the groundwork is in place or to arrive at the same conclusions from (seemingly) unrelated points of view. After working with this maths for years my ears pricked up the minute I saw a number close to 36 appear in the denominator because I knew that everything would then lock into place.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Note that (as with your scale) that when you take 1.23606 times 1.618034 (the &quot;phi-tave&quot;)...it &quot;magically&quot; brings you directly to the 2/1 octave!</p><p>Ah but this is no accident. This is the definition of a number and its inverse. From 25, its inverse is 36 - 25 = 11 so that 25 + 11 = 36 (the 8ve). (And remember that adding indices is the same as multiplying, subtracting same as dividing). By slightly detuning phi to within very negligible boundaries, we preserve the 8ve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Note<br/>&gt;  1.47214 is a bit &quot;off&quot; the 12TET fifth but, to my ears, it fits into the other notes in the scale (aside from the root tone) a bit better.</p><p>Yes 20 is only 1 away from the usual fifth 21. I can&apos;t test it (haven&apos;t got scalar) but usual fifth 21 is closer to just fifth 5/4 or 81/64 than 20. But if you&apos;re coming from phi, that should be a whole different ball game!(major chords can sound naff in serial music).<br/>&gt; *******************************************************<br/>&gt;    I derived my PHI scale simply by taking the space between 0.618034 and 0...and dividing it by multiplying 0.618034 by itself...and then repeating the process until I hit 1.1459.<br/>&gt;   That gave me<br/>&gt; 0.618 (*0.618034 = 0.3819)<br/>&gt; 0.3819 (*0.618034 = 0.23606)<br/>&gt; 0.23606 (*0.618034 = 0.145898)<br/>&gt; 0.145898<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    I was eager to find in an extra note (the make it an 8-note per 2/1 octave scale) so I took 0.618034 - 0.1458 to &quot;split the area in the opposite direction&quot;.  This gave me the extra 0.47214.  Next I figured I was taking a line between 0 and 0.618034 so, to &quot;push it back into place&quot;, I &quot;translated&quot; everything back by adding 1 (making it the equivalent of splitting between 1 and 1.618034).</p><p>Good reasoning. If you translate this into the tuning it should get easier now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; **************************************************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Correct me if I am wrong, but it looks like we could be running into an<br/>&gt; intersection here...and may indeed be able to introduce a PHI scale that both preserves the octave and fits just about perfectly into 36TET. :-)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;<br/>You&apos;re absolutely right. Not just introduces phi and preserves the octave but the whole of 12 tone harmony as well. And who knows what other types of harmonies we can get now that we seem to have three minor thirds, three majors etc (or are they now minor or major??). And  don&apos;t forget to post some phi things so I can hear them.

It is sqrt2,  2^(6/12) = 2^(18/36) = 2^(1/2) = 1.414. While 7/4 gives a rough estimate, 45/32 = 1.40625 while 181/128 = 1.414062. The use of the &quot;devil&apos;s interval&quot; would probably explain why it sounds dark. 2.414 comes between 45 and 46 in the 36 system i.e. two of the minor thirds 9 and 10 taken up the octave (+36) so I don&apos;t think the silver fits into the system any where near as well as the phi. (incidentally, I noticed that 8 gives a very good approx to 7/6). Besides, I think we&apos;re getting into the arena of intervals so fine that it would be hard to hear the difference. I still would like to hear the phi intervals -25,0,25 and 0,11,25 if you&apos;ve got a moment.

I suppose this is because of the nature of phi constantly reinforcing the original frequencies. And yes, both eg&apos;s seem to give the same beats and sound very similar. They also seem to sound better after the initial attack of the notes (probably due to extraneous upper harmonics?). As for the virtual pitch, if you mean the GCD, the closest ratio I could find to 25 was 1657/1024 which is so high it doesn&apos;t seem very helpful, but it&apos;s early days yet. (And these posts are coming to me at 2am these days so I&apos;m usually tired).</p><p>You know I&apos;ve been thinking that there&apos;s stacks we can do with a 36 mod, anything from standard jazz harmonies (or new variations of) to completely phi based compositions to 36 tone rows (even from a probability perspective there are 36! i.e. 36 factorial, possible combinations which reaches into the billions). And of course since both 11 and 25 are odd then they can be seen as generators of all 36 notes. Looking at the intervals successively we have 11 - 0 = 11 and 25 - 11 = 14, suggests the symmetrical chord 0:11:14:25 (which you might want to test). And naturally we can then treat 11 and 25 as our new 0 giving 25:0:3:14 (i.e. Transpose 11 or T11 meaning subtract 11, where 0 = 36) and 11:22:25:0 (T25) i.e. we take phi from phi, and play it altogether 0:3:11:14:22:25. But then 8 appears which we can then add, and so on. (But the problem is that being generators we end up with all 36 notes, so where to stop??

It is sqrt2,  2^(6/12) = 2^(18/36) = 2^(1/2) = 1.414. While 7/4 gives a rough estimate, 45/32 = 1.40625 while 181/128 = 1.414062. The use of the &quot;devil&apos;s interval&quot; would probably explain why it sounds dark. 2.414 comes between 45 and 46 in the 36 system i.e. two of the minor thirds 9 and 10 taken up the octave (+36) so I don&apos;t think the silver fits into the system any where near as well as the phi. (incidentally, I noticed that 8 gives a very good approx to 7/6). Besides, I think we&apos;re getting into the arena of intervals so fine that it would be hard to hear the difference. I still would like to hear the phi intervals -25,0,25 and 0,11,25 if you&apos;ve got a moment. Thanks mate<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Rick<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Between my own experiments and your findings, I considered it worth<br/>&gt; &gt; a shot to try and translate the silver ratio of 2.414 (where<br/>&gt; &gt; 1 / 2.414 =0.414) and multiply 0.414 by itself and add 1 to all of<br/>&gt; &gt; the results to create the scale<br/>&gt; &gt;   1.07107<br/>&gt; &gt;   1.1715<br/>&gt; &gt;   1.24257<br/>&gt; &gt;   1.34314<br/>&gt; &gt;   1.414<br/>&gt; &gt;  (period / &quot;silver-tave&quot;)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This results in a full 10 notes per 2/1 octave and, best yet,<br/>&gt; &gt; virtually all combinations are very harmonically use-able.  Though<br/>&gt; &gt; I must warn<br/>&gt; &gt; A) The vibe is a bit dark-sounding<br/>&gt; &gt; B) You may want to round the period from 1.414 to about 1.406 to<br/>&gt; &gt; alleviate conflicts in upper-range overtones of the harmonic series<br/>&gt; &gt; by bringing the period closer to 7/5 IE 1.4.  This will also help<br/>&gt; &gt; greatly to solve the one major outstanding problem with the above<br/>&gt; &gt; scale: playing notes exactly 1 period above each other beat a bit<br/>&gt; &gt; too much to sound smooth.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; BTW, if you could find a good denominator for 1.414 or 1.406....<br/>&gt; &gt; I would be interested to see if you could fit the Silver Ratio scale<br/>&gt; &gt; well into a TET-type construction (just as you did quite well for<br/>&gt; &gt; my newest PHI scale with 36TET for &quot;x/36&quot;)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The result of &quot;what the silver ratio scale would sound like if<br/>&gt; &gt; this scale was used in composition&quot; are above...and I&apos;m admittedly<br/>&gt; &gt; not even that good a composer and I still can&apos;t get over the sound<br/>&gt; &gt; of it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Rick wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Ah but this is no accident. This is the definition of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;number and its inverse. From 25, its inverse is 36 - 25 = 11<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;so that 25 + 11 = 36 (the 8ve).&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Come to think of it, exactly, the exponentials &quot;add up&quot;.  In<br/>&gt; &gt; additional, what seems to make noble numbers that make good scale<br/>&gt; &gt; generators unique is that they satisfy<br/>&gt; &gt; x = 1/x + any whole number... and the resulting scales can be<br/>&gt; &gt; described as both additively and exponentially symmetrical.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Since 25 is our new phi, then 50 is phi squared, 75 phi cubed,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;and so on. But because 50 and 75 exceed 36, they are replaced by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;14 and 3 respectively.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ah, now I get it...you are reducing exponentials of PHI to fit<br/>&gt; &gt; within a single octave.  So you would get 25,14,3,(75-(36*2)),<br/>&gt; &gt; 28 (100-(36*2)), etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And, of course, you&apos;re right that 12TET is encapsulated perfectly<br/>&gt; &gt; as every third note in 36TET.   Although our methods of PHI scales<br/>&gt; &gt; now differ (I take (1/PHI)^x) + 1 to get my scale where you take a<br/>&gt; &gt; form of PHI^x (which, actually, is a lot like my old method of<br/>&gt; &gt; making the scale).  Regardless...both the &quot;new and old&quot; ways of<br/>&gt; &gt; making the PHI scale, along with 12TET, fit into 36TET...and one<br/>&gt; &gt; good question may be &quot;what kind of combinations may be able to<br/>&gt; &gt; combined 12TET harmonies with PHI-based tones as &apos;blue notes&apos;&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;And who knows what other types of harmonies we can get now that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;we seem to have three minor thirds, three majors etc (or are they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;now minor or major??).&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Exactly!  The thing I have noticed with noble scales in general is<br/>&gt; &gt; instead of just trying to optimize the situation<br/>&gt; &gt; A) the overtones/harmonics of an instrument intersect with notes<br/>&gt; &gt; higher in the scale (which obviously, produces no beating as the<br/>&gt; &gt; two tones are at the same frequency)...they also get to take<br/>&gt; &gt; advantage of<br/>&gt; &gt; B) the overtones DON&apos;T intersect at all at some parts but, in<br/>&gt; &gt; those parts, are at least a semi-tone or so away from where they<br/>&gt; &gt; would intersect...just far enough away to avoid extremities in<br/>&gt; &gt; beating altogether on both sides of the &quot;perfect intersection&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Michael<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=83258 href="#83258">ðŸ”—</a>djtrancendance@...</h3><span>4/27/2009 6:52:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick&gt;&quot;Firstly, if you meant that Phi^x referred to taking 25 and squaring&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;,cubing, etc...(but in Rick&apos;s new version) squaring now is&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;equal to adding 1 and so on. &quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right...but I am saying the methods, though your one is expressed as 2^(x/36) and mine as PHI^x end up intersecting most of the same value IE (est. 1.309).&nbsp; So you end up with very similar tunings from which to build scales.&nbsp; I know I am a bit deviant for this...but if my ear hears the same thing and the values are generally very close, I basically consider it the same thing as it has essentially the same musical functionality.</p><p>Rick&gt; &quot;Secondly,(1/ PHI)^x = (2^-(25/36)) ^x = 2^[-(25/36)+ x] so that&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot; your method is this + 1. eg x = 1 = (36/36) and index becomes -25&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot; + 36 = 11 giving [2^(11/36)]. &quot;<br/>&gt; However, I don&apos;t see the need of then&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;adding 1 to this.

You should write a whole composition). What is really interesting is that a melody in beats seems to come out all on its own, going from 5th to 7th to maj 6 back to 7th. Very interesting indeed. Really like this one. I&apos;ve been thinking that the clash in the beginning of notes might be caused by the piano sample you&apos;re using which tend to have a lot of treble harmonics. Why not try more neutral instruments like strings or flutes (I often find that clarinets are good for checking harmony)? Or perhaps ask Bill his opinion as to what tone you should go for. I&apos;d love to hear the result.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;As for the virtual pitch, if you mean the GCD, the closest ratio I<br/>&gt; could find to 25 was&quot; &gt;&quot;1657/1024 which is so high it doesn&apos;t seem very<br/>&gt; helpful, but it&apos;s early days yet.&quot;<br/>&gt;    Technically, you&apos;re right, it is, of course, the actual GCD between the two chords is far from in common.  But, as you said before the beating between the two sounds very similar.  My point is that...even though the a simple GCD does not occur...the mind/ear in many ways can&apos;t tell the difference between the &quot;aligned beating&quot; of the PHI scale and a true GCD; both seem to have the same effect of pointing the a similar root tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;But then 8 appears which we can then add, and so on. (But the problem<br/>&gt; is that being&quot; &gt;&quot;generators we end up with all 36 notes, so where to<br/>&gt; stop?? Are they ordered notes?).&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     This is a fundamental issue I have with using PHI^x and particularly many PHI scales other than my own...they use PHI as an infinite generator that goes &apos;in circles&apos; until it hits just about everything.  Which is a bad idea for consonance if you go to far...of course.<br/>&gt;      The only way I&apos;ve figured out to make every note within a period truly a power of PHI is to use 1 + (1/PHI^x) as the generator.  This gives your (2^) 0,11,25 (out of 36) chord plus the additional notes 16 (about 1.38), 20 ,and 7...and makes the gaps between any two successive notes equal to 1/PHI.</p><p>I can&apos;t remember what &quot;period&quot; is in this context (I&apos;m conditioned to think of it as inverse of frequency). And do you mean 1 + 1/(phi^x) = 1 + (phi^-x) where x = 0,1,2,...? But this would give the first number when x = 0 as 2. Also 1/phi = 2^(11/36) which would give 0,11,22,33,44=8,19,etc...until all 36 notes are included (i.e. 11 doesn&apos;t go into 36 and so can generate the whole scale). I&apos;m sure you don&apos;t mean this so you&apos;ll have to be more precise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;0:3:11:14:22:25.<br/>&gt;     This is almost precisely what my old PHI^x/2^y scale gave...in fact 14 is almost exactly phi^2/2.   I still am pretty convinced the new theory above sounds much more consonant, though...of course I am going to give sound examples<br/>&gt;  later IE in my next message and when I have the time to make them of your chord and the nearest equivalent in my new &quot;1/PHI&quot; system.<br/>&gt;    Note that...in general, I have found any two note closer than about the 1.055 interval begin to beat wildly...but the good news is between 0 and 3...and 11 and 14 in your chord are just wide enough to avoid this beating problem, at least for the root tone (though not so sure about the overtone which is why I&apos;ll have to try a sound example). :-)</p><p>Yeah this would exclude 1 and 2. Incidentally, 3 is the cubed root of 9 (the 12tet min 3rd) and 7 the cubed root of 21, the tempered fifth. These seem to suggest new symmetric chords similar to the diminished and augmented etc...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;suggests the symmetrical chord 0:11:14:25 (which you might want to<br/>&gt; test).

Instruments come with their own special character and I often find that, given a &quot;neutral&quot; score, assigning instruments according to their range usually works out just fine. If you want long extended notes, go the strings or woodwind, short stabbing notes, accentuate with the brass. If the strings sound wishy-washy, then this can be easily rectified by doubling up the beginning of notes with trumpets or by making the strings staccato or marcato etc...The problem with alternate tunings on the piano (samples) is that they tend to sound like one of those honky tonk saloon pianos found in the old cowboy movies.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;I can&apos;t remember what &quot;period&quot; is in this context (I&apos;m conditioned&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot; to think of it as inverse of frequency). &quot;<br/>&gt;    Thanks for bringing this up...we are in fact not talking about the signal-processing/physics definition you mentioned above, but instead the period of symmetry IE the equivalent of an &quot;octave&quot; (though I refuse to use the term &apos;phi-tave&apos;) due to some people getting very angry at me for calling something other than 2/1 an &quot;octave&quot;.  So, in short, 1.618034 is the period in both my old and new version PHI scales.  And 1.414 (1/2.414 + 1) is the period in my Silver Ratio scale.</p><p>Yeah I remember. I don&apos;t know why people adopt already well-defined terms in a completely new context. Why don&apos;t they use &quot;generating interval&quot; or something because that&apos;s exactly what it seems to be? But I&apos;m still not clear as to what your generating interval is. Here you say it&apos;s phi but in the last post you gave 1 + phi^-x, while above you write for the silver ratio 1.414 (1/2.414 + 1). I suspect you mean that 1.414 = (1/2.414 + 1), which it does, instead of 1.414 x (1/2.414 + 1) which is what it looks like. There are certain math&apos;l conventions which help to make things clearer. Writing ax for eg means their product a times x. And I see below that you&apos;re beginning to watch your brackets. Incidentally, 1.414...is the square root of 2 which corresponds to the flat-fifth interval, 2^(1/2). This divides the 8ve in half.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mike&gt;&quot;11 and 14 in your chord are just wide enough to avoid this<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;problem, at least for the root tone (though not so sure about the&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;overtone which is why I&apos;ll have to try a sound example). :-)&quot;<br/>&gt; Rick&gt;&quot;Yeah this would exclude 1 and 2.&quot;<br/>&gt;   Indeed...noble numbered scales have the inherent danger of<br/>&gt;  leading toward numbers with interval gaps smaller than 1.05 (but larger than about 1.01) that simply produce too much roughness to be good for consonance.  It is, IMVHO, a great way to single out frequencies in a scale you know will cause dissonance due to critical band roughness...and the best scale-creating formulas, IMVHO, avoid creating/leading to frequencies which break this &quot;critical band rule&quot; altogether.</p><p>Sorry Mike, everything else I agree with but I don&apos;t know what IMVHO stands for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mike&gt; &quot;Ah, ok...I see how you are using inversions of the chord&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;0:11:14:25 to build your &apos;36TET PHI scale&apos;...you are changing the&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot; &apos;root&apos; the the second note and taking intervals from there...very clear&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;explanation the time around. :-)&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick&gt;&quot;But that&apos;s the beauty of this mod maths, that it all begins to meet&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;up whatever you do.

Not to mention the ease of transposing/&quot;moving every note in the scale up by one step&quot; within equal temperament tunings.  The question from myself to you then becomes...can you think of a good formula that fits any fractal number into an ET/mod?<br/>&gt; For example consider the &quot;fractal numbers&quot;:<br/>&gt; 2.4142135  where x^2 = 2x + 1 (the &quot;Silver Ratio&quot;)<br/>&gt; 3.3027756 where x^2 = 3x + 1<br/>&gt; 4.2360679 where x^2 = 4x + 1<br/>&gt; (these are actually many of the same ones from Jacques Dudon&apos;s post).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The thing with my  1+(1/fractal)^x is that it can produce consonant scales from all of the above...it would be great if you could devise a formula to closely estimate any scale generated by the above fractal numbers into an ET tuning.<br/>&gt;  If you did so, I would be happy to write a program that would automatically find the best MOD given any generator and create scales using that MOD.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;<br/>It is certainly a nice idea but making it a reality is a different matter. For 2^(1/2) (i.e. silver minus 1), it is already in 12 and 36 MOD as 6 and 18. Being the only interval (dyad) that divides the 8ve into two equal parts, its recursive properties are well known (i.e. Sqrt2/1 = 2/sqrt2, so which is the tonic?). And the discovery (at least for me) that phi can be represented by 25 and 11 in 36 MOD, which includes 12 MOD and all of the traditional harmony, came as a complete surprise. This makes it extremely practical. But as for the silver ratio, sqrt2 + 1, the closest interval I could deduce was 2^(2543/2000)= 2.414124, implying a 2000 MOD (bringing into one 8ve, 2543 - 2000 = 543 and 2^(543/2000)). Although electronics could reach it, I&apos;m sure that we are far beyond the range of human recognition here. And besides, the technique you are already adopting seems much simpler. So unless I&apos;m mistaken, the phi tuning seems to be a one-off, shame but that&apos;s math&apos;s for you.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83283 href="#83283">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2009 4:55:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Say Michael, would you post a piece of music that demonstrates what you&apos;re talking about?</p><p>Not some arpeggios with a bad &quot;piano&quot; sound, you could pretty much roll dice to make a tuning that works that approach (and some of us have done just such things :-) ).

First is that applying PHI successively spirals off into infinity (so that all pitch classes would eventually end up having the same note name). Second, the 12th root of PHI gives a very small interval of the order of 1.04, which is below the threshold of critical band roughness. Besides, there is really no reason to believe that dividing PHI by 12 would be the same as 12 EDO which evolved by approximating basic JI intervals.</p><p>On the other hand, 36 EDO not only includes 12 EDO as the series 0,3,6,9,...i.e. 2^(3/36) = 2^(1/12), the semitone, so that all traditional 12 tet harmonies are preserved, but it also allows access to PHI intervals 25 and its inverse 11 (i.e. [2^(11/36)]/2 = 2^-(25/36)). Note also that the difference between 2^(25/36) and PHI is well below 5 cents. Since 25 and 11 don&apos;t divide into 36 then they can be seen as scale generators i.e. 25 + 25 + 25...and bringing them within the 8ve will give all 35 notes, so that it can in fact be seen as a PHI tuning. One new symmetrical chord you might want to look at is 0:5:10:15:20:25. I&apos;m having difficulties downloading Scala so I wouldn&apos;t mind hearing it if you&apos;ve got the time (PS: Is there a Scala forum for troubleshooting?

Although electronics<br/>&gt; could reach it, I&apos;m sure that we are far beyond the range of human<br/>&gt; recognition here. And besides, the technique you are already adopting<br/>&gt; seems much simpler. So unless I&apos;m mistaken, the phi  tuning seems to be a one-off, shame but that&apos;s math&apos;s for you.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I agree...it seems to be out of reach to find a near-perfect match for the Silver Ratio using the mod AKA &quot;ET&quot; technique...and no one with practical instruments (or even most working with electronic ones) is likely going to want to mess with 2000-TET. :-D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    While the technique is using, I believe, is very simple (mostly just taking 1/fractal_number squared + 1 to get all the numbers in the scale, which works for any fractal number)...I am watching out for the following:<br/>&gt; A) To help counter my own bias: it&apos;s easier to truly test my theory if I have something that can approximate it that can create notes in the same &quot;ballpark&quot; and compete with it directly...in the same way 36TET does a great job at approximating both your PHI scales and my new ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     For example...the concept of MOS, IMVHO, is the corollary to JI, which prevents it from having a monopoly...and the same goes for Sethares derivation of JI assuming a simple-ratio timbre and applying it to consonance curves to derive JI: they are many paths to get to a similar and competitive result.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; B) Universalism: I am highly convinced that an ideal formula will work for any fractal number, and not just PHI and/or the Silver Ratio...in the same way MOS can work for turning any number, fractal numbers included, into scales which match the 2/1 octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C) Documentation: I hope to be able to sum up how to generate scales with noble numbers in a way simple enough so an average musician can pick it up.  I hope to eventually create something as easily to sum up as, say, the concept of MOS scales is to creating just about any consonant scale within the 2/1 octave (since it can easily derive JI, pentatonic, diatonic...IE it&apos;s quite universal for 2/1 octave scales).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     And I realize fitting fractal numbered scales into ET may be an incredibly tricky, or, as you seem to say, virtually impossible task.  I&apos;m just eager to find a corollary to my own methods for the reasons above...and, of course, to avoid it &quot;having a monopoly&quot; as the only scale that hits frequencies in the same area, which is not exactly useful for finding ways to challenge and ultimately improve it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=83302 href="#83302">ðŸ”—</a>vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2009 6:13:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the other hand, 36 EDO not only includes 12 EDO as the series 0,3,6,9,...i.e. 2^(3/36) = 2^(1/12), the semitone, so that all traditional 12 tet harmonies are preserved, but it also allows access<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Rick<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Rick,</p><p>For what it is worth I tried 36 EDO via bend commands in the late 90&apos;s in a tracker.</p><p><a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/mp3/goose.mp3">http://clones.soonlabel.com/mp3/goose.mp3</a></p><p>Be warned the piano sample sucks.

But as you said, we are spoiled now.</p><p>Well the point is that its not just the PHI and 1/PHI because its inverse IS also PHI from another perspective. It&apos;s a bit like saying &quot;I don&apos;t see the point of a major triad&quot; as if we could only ever play it from the tonic. For starters, watch how it captures all the usual recursive properties of PHI. Inverting should be equal to itself - 1: 2^-(25/36) = 0.618...(Bringing it into the same 8ve gives 2^(11/36)). Squaring should be equal to itself + 1: [2^(25/36)]^2 = 2^(50/36)= 2.618...The list goes on. Of course we can then apply all of this to our newly gained notes and repeat the process i.e. taking Phi of Phi etc...And as I said, since 11 and 25 don&apos;t divide into 36 then all notes will eventually be reached so it IS a complete phi tuning system already. Therefore there is nothing in the audible range of PHI that should not be able to be captured by this system (including Wilson&apos;s holograms). PHI does seem to bring together the two worlds of ratios and sums/differences. Beats are created which seem to reinforce the original frequencies.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83313 href="#83313">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2009 11:29:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
