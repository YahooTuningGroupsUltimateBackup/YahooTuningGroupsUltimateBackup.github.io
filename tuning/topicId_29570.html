As far as I know, this specific overall system<br/>hasn&apos;t been discussed here previously, but I&apos;m open to correction on<br/>that point.</p><p>An additional object of this game is to decide, or to debate, whether<br/>this tuning system is a &quot;middle path&quot; -- either before or after the<br/>&quot;official&quot; solution is deduced/intuited by some participant or group<br/>of participants (cooperative puzzle-solving is encouraged), or as a<br/>last resort revealed by the author.</p><p>Anyone is free to ask questions and seek &quot;hints&quot;; I&apos;ll try to be as<br/>helpful as I can without making the solution overly obvious at too<br/>early a stage.</p><p>Also, part of the fun is for people so inclined to discuss the clues<br/>and cooperate in seeking a solution. This can be an educational<br/>process in itself, as well as a strategy for a faster solution:<br/>pooling knowledge and intuitions is what this list is about.</p><p>          -------------------------------------------------<br/>          Puzzle: Can you identify this &quot;microtemperament&quot;?<br/>          -------------------------------------------------</p><p>You are brought into a room with a keyboard instrument having a<br/>certain number of notes per octave greater than 12, and invited to try<br/>&quot;my latest tuning -- just possibly a new one.&quot; Moving your fingers<br/>around the keyboards with their conventional 12-note arrangements, and<br/>measuring interval sizes flawlessly, you get some curious clues.</p><p>1. You find that an approximation of 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 is<br/>available at 9 locations with a sum of squares variation from just of<br/>around 8.92 cents, giving 2:3 (or its octave complement of 3:4) a<br/>double weighting, Paul Erlich style, since it occurs twice.</p><p>Your result brings the comment, &quot;Yes, it actually outdoes 36-tET, with<br/>better accuracy on every interval, although it&apos;s not as accurate<br/>overall as Graham Breed&apos;s 135-tET.&quot;</p><p>2. Pressing the keys C-E on one of the manuals, you get a major third<br/>with a ratio of almost precisely a just 100:127 -- a possible oxymoron<br/>under a Dave Keenan definition of &quot;just,&quot; by the way. You confirm that<br/>this interval is built in a usual eventone fashion, and that the<br/>tuning is an array of eventone MOS sets.</p><p>3. Pressing the keys Eb-F# on any of the manuals, you get a minor kind<br/>of third which brings the comment, &quot;Notice that this interval is about<br/>3.76 cents more accurate than its nearest counterpart in 22-tET --<br/>although lots of people on the Alternate Tuning List might view it the<br/>other way because they&apos;re interested in a different ratio, one<br/>included in the decatonic tetrad of 4:5:6:7.&quot;</p><p>You are offered an additional clue to what ratio is &quot;3.76 cents more<br/>accurate than in 22-tET.&quot; One of the integer terms for this dyad is<br/>equal to the largest Pythagorean MOS discussed in late medieval<br/>European theory (e.g. Prosdocimus, Ugolino); the other is equal to the<br/>number of notes per octave on a split-key organ sometimes cited as the<br/>earliest known practical example, dating from around the era of Ramos<br/>and taken by Mark Lindley as an early meantone instrument.</p><p>4. Starting with C# on one of the keyboards as the lowest note, you<br/>find that you can play a kind of approximation of 14:18:21:24 by<br/>pressing the same set of key levers that you&apos;d use for the nearest<br/>approximation in 1/4-comma meantone -- but with not all these levers<br/>located on the same manual. Rather, you find yourself combining two of<br/>the levers from one manual with two from another. The resulting<br/>approximation has a variation from pure of about 2.70 cents narrow for<br/>the lower 7:9, and 4.19 cents narrow for the outer 7:12; the upper 7:8<br/>is off by 5.68 cents, also in the narrow direction.</p><p>This prompts the comment, &quot;This has a certain meantone-like feel, but<br/>I should assure you that this tuning system wasn&apos;t derived by mistake<br/>while attempting a subset of Vicentino&apos;s cycle -- just in case there<br/>might be any possible rumors on the list.&quot;</p><p>5. Who should enter the room but Dan Stearns, who does his own quick<br/>test and excitedly comments: &quot;This tuning has a very accurate<br/>emulation of the 20-tET approximation of 28:27.&quot; He also notes that<br/>this near-28:27 is tempered by twice as much as the best approximation<br/>of 9:7, and that there&apos;s a closer approximation of 28:27 in five<br/>locations tempered by about 1.20 cents in the opposite direction.</p><p>6. For a change of pace, you try appropriate keys for an approximation<br/>of the Bohlen-Pierce triad at 3:5:7, and find the 3:5 about 3.20 cents<br/>wide, and the 5:7 narrow by an identical amount.</p><p>However, your puzzler adds, &quot;This near-3:5:7 is only available in<br/>four positions in the overall tuning -- as Dave Keenan might observe<br/>when gauging utility.&quot;</p><p>By the way, you note that the near-3:5 has the same key positions as<br/>in an eventone or &quot;Pythagorean&quot; arrangement of 22-tET -- for example,<br/>C-G# -- but with the two notes played on different keyboards.</p><p>7. You also find nine near-9:11 intervals about 2.22 cents wider than<br/>just.</p><p>8. At 18 positions in the overall tuning, you find approximations of<br/>the 11:13 ratio at about 0.45 cents wide.</p><p>9. Some recent talk on the list about unison vectors and the like<br/>leads to the comment: &quot;Each MOS set disperses the 351:352 comma, and<br/>the overall tuning very closely represents the 77:78 comma. However,<br/>that isn&apos;t to imply that this is a periodicity block -- let Paul<br/>Erlich or someone decide that.&quot;</p><p>10. As a curiosity, you find three locations in the overall tuning<br/>approximating 4:5:6:7 with a near-4:5 at about 391.01 cents, prompting<br/>the comment, &quot;That&apos;s the least accurate interval in this tetrad, with<br/>5:6 off in the narrow direction by around 3.20 cents.&quot; The position<br/>for one of these tetrads involving pressing the keys Eb-F#-Bb-C in<br/>ascending order -- but with two notes on one manual, and two on<br/>another.</p><p>Will someone be able to identify the system based on these clues?<br/>People should feel free to ask more questions -- about interval sizes<br/>and approximations, or about what intervals are produced by pressing<br/>certain keys, etc. You can also ask about the size of the tuning, and<br/>I have a clue ready for that. &quot;Yes or no&quot; questions in &quot;Twenty<br/>Questions&quot; fashion are also fine.</p><p>If and when someone or some group of participants correctly identifies<br/>the system, I&apos;ll confirm this; if not, I&apos;ll let the search for clues<br/>continue for a reasonable time before announcing the &quot;official&quot;<br/>solution.</p><p>Also, it may provide a clue that I regard the &quot;middle path&quot; status of<br/>the _overall_ system as something of a debatable question.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=29583 href="#29583">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2001 6:15:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 1. You find that an approximation of 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 is<br/>&gt; available at 9 locations with a sum of squares variation from just<br/>of<br/>&gt; around 8.92 cents,</p><p>You mean 8.92 cents _squared_, not 8.92 cents, right? If the sum-of-<br/>squares is 8.92 cents squared, and six intervals are being compared<br/>here, then the mean-square is 1.49 cents squared, and the root-mean-<br/>squared variation from just is, enfin, 1.22 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. Pressing the keys C-E on one of the manuals, you get a major<br/>third<br/>&gt; with a ratio of almost precisely a just 100:127 -- a possible<br/>oxymoron<br/>&gt; under a Dave Keenan definition of &quot;just,&quot; by the way. You confirm<br/>that<br/>&gt; this interval is built in a usual eventone fashion, and that the<br/>&gt; tuning is an array of eventone MOS sets.</p><p>So the fifth is about 703.45 cents. The squared deviation from a just<br/>fifth is about 2.23 cents squared. So the fifth accounts for 4.46<br/>cents squared of the 8.92 total. Exactly half -- and yet there are<br/>four more intervals to take into account here: two 7:6s, one 7:4, and<br/>one 9:7. I must conclude, therefore, that you are using just 7:6s!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. Pressing the keys Eb-F# on any of the manuals, you get a minor<br/>kind<br/>&gt; of third which brings the comment, &quot;Notice that this interval is<br/>about<br/>&gt; 3.76 cents more accurate than its nearest counterpart in 22-tET --<br/>&gt; although lots of people on the Alternate Tuning List might view it<br/>the<br/>&gt; other way because they&apos;re interested in a different ratio, one<br/>&gt; included in the decatonic tetrad of 4:5:6:7.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are offered an additional clue to what ratio is &quot;3.76 cents more<br/>&gt; accurate than in 22-tET.&quot; One of the integer terms for this dyad is<br/>&gt; equal to the largest Pythagorean MOS discussed in late medieval<br/>&gt; European theory (e.g. Prosdocimus, Ugolino);</p><p>17</p><p>&gt; the other is equal to the<br/>&gt; number of notes per octave on a split-key organ sometimes cited as<br/>the<br/>&gt; earliest known practical example, dating from around the era of<br/>Ramos<br/>&gt; and taken by Mark Lindley as an early meantone instrument.</p><p>14? . . . 17:14 is 336.13 cents; 22-tET has an interval of 327.28<br/>cents; so 331.03 cents is your interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. Starting with C# on one of the keyboards as the lowest note, you<br/>&gt; find that you can play a kind of approximation of 14:18:21:24 by<br/>&gt; pressing the same set of key levers that you&apos;d use for the nearest<br/>&gt; approximation in 1/4-comma meantone -- but with not all these levers<br/>&gt; located on the same manual.

So this must be a different approximation to 14:18:21:24<br/>than the &quot;good&quot; one mentioned first, with a difference of 4.19 cents.</p><p>&gt; and 4.19 cents narrow for the outer 7:12;</p><p>OK . . . this was just before . . . so again a difference of 4.19<br/>cents pops up . . .</p><p>&gt; the upper 7:8<br/>&gt; is off by 5.68 cents, also in the narrow direction.</p><p>Hmm . . . so the lower 3:2 is 1.49 cents wide, making it a &quot;regular&quot;<br/>fifth in the system . . . the &quot;regular&quot; 7:8 would be 1.49 cents<br/>narrow, so once again the difference is 4.19 cents . . . and in this<br/>chord, the central 7:6 is wide by x where</p><p>(-2.70) + x + (-5.68) = -4.19<br/>x = 4.19</p><p>4.19 cents, once again!</p><p>&gt; 5.
