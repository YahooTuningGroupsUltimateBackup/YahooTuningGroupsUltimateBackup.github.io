I think it&apos;s a<br/>&gt;great little microtonal keyboard.<br/>&gt;Harold had a webpage about it, but I can&apos;t find it now.</p><p>I think Harold said he would be away on vacation this week, so he probably won&apos;t<br/>get to answering this.  His home page is now located at:</p><p><a href="http://www.visi.com/~hfortuin/index1.htm">http://www.visi.com/~hfortuin/index1.htm</a></p><p>There&apos;s a bit of info there on the Clavette, and a picture of it without the key<br/>template in place, so you can see the pattern of switches beneath.</p></div>
