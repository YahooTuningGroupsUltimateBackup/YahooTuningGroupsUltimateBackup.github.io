First, your readers didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; see the single page program I had to do the night before because<br/>&gt; of a computer problem.  ...You needn&apos;t belabor obvious typos.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Second, there is no experiment in using CDs to move between set<br/>&gt; pieces.  In order to have an attention span 11 hours long, or<br/>&gt; even less, the music must appear still moving.  Straight<br/>&gt; &quot;non-live performer&quot; music is like television to many.  Silent<br/>&gt; moving of equipment would have had an adverse effect and people<br/>&gt; would have simply walked out of the microthon.  You didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; mention the humidity of the day with the downpour.</p><p>The last sentence is a reference to the &apos;lack of oxygen&apos; complaint.<br/>Johnny is quite correct that I should have mentioned the terrible<br/>weather we unfortunately had to contend with this year.</p><p>Correction from David Beardsley regarding his piece _Sonic Bloom_:</p><p>&gt; Not a subharmonic tuning.</p><p>The scale is actually:<br/>1/1 9/8 7/6 9/7 11/8 3/2 13/8 7/4</p><p>Dave&apos;s guitar was a Gibson L6S, used as a MIDI controller,<br/>and the source of the sounds was a Korg 05R/W rack-mount synth.</p><p>Joseph L.
