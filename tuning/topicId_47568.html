Pitches<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t that interesting :).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cents notation is designed to break out of the microtonal<br/>subculture<br/>&gt; &gt; ghetto and to put everyone on the same page.  And it works well,<br/>too.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; best, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Klaus,</p><p>Let me begin by saying that Dave Keenan and I appreciate both your<br/>constructive criticism and moral support of our efforts in attempting<br/>to produce a generalized notation that can be used for many different<br/>tunings.  Since Johnny&apos;s cents notation would seem to have the same<br/>objective, it might appear that these are two competing systems, when<br/>nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>I believe that it&apos;s counterproductive to argue whether sagittal or<br/>cents notation is better.  They both give information about *pitch*<br/>(and/or intervals), but they do this in very different (I would say,<br/>complementary) *formats*, each of which has specific advantages over<br/>the other for certain purposes and applications.</p><p>Johnny&apos;s notation has decades of experience to demonstrate beyond<br/>dispute that his notation not only works, but that it works<br/>*extremely well* as a performance notation for instruments of<br/>flexible pitch.  Any alleged shortcomings that others may find tend<br/>to focus on difficulties in perceiving harmonic relationships (hence<br/>leaving much to be desired for the process of composing music).</p><p>Sagittal notation is only arriving on the scene, but it has been in<br/>development for over 2 years, and Dave and I have expended an<br/>extraordinary amount of effort to ensure that it also works<br/>*extremely well* in conveying harmonic relationships (and hence<br/>excels as a theoretical notation).  Hence, virtually all of the<br/>criticism thus far has focused on concerns that the symbols might<br/>leave something to be desired in a performance situation (although we<br/>have also expended considerable effort to ensure that this is not<br/>so).  Whatever the case, it remains that the notation be tested for<br/>real-time readability by others in the months ahead.</p><p>I mentioned above that I believe that the two notations are<br/>complementary rather than competitive, from which one might infer<br/>that certain instrumental (and vocal) parts could be notated in such<br/>a way as to combine the two approaches.  This would allow a player to<br/>use either approach separately, or alternatively, to use one of these<br/>for primary direction, supplemented from time to time by the other,<br/>as needed.  A few months ago Johnny and I privately discussed a few<br/>issues that would need to be addressed in combining the two<br/>approaches in a printed part, and we did agree that the idea was<br/>worth pursuing.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=47798 href="#47798">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/9/2003 12:40:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you, Klaus, for the explanation.

I do believe that Sagittal, if its final<br/>incarnation<br/>&gt; comes out right, will be preferable (for reasons below). I also<br/>&gt; believe/can see that it will not be easy for it to get accepted,<br/>&gt; partly because some composers and instrumentalists think that 72-et<br/>is<br/>&gt; a reasonably good and very workable approximation for their<br/>purposes<br/>&gt; (they may well be right), partly because you have a little<br/>tradition<br/>&gt; of cents notation going, but mainly because so much of the more<br/>&gt; freewheeling tuning where Sagittal can prove itself goes on and is<br/>&gt; notated in the midi realm, hardly ever encountering a real live<br/>&gt; performer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; klaus<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Which makes me wonder if there is any kind of *utility* for this<br/>kind of notation in any case...  As I had mentioned before, it seems<br/>like more a &quot;composer shorthand&quot; than a musical notation...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=47846 href="#47846">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2003 12:38:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

This would allow a player<br/>to<br/>&gt; use either approach separately, or alternatively, to use one of<br/>these<br/>&gt; for primary direction, supplemented from time to time by the other,<br/>&gt; as needed.  A few months ago Johnny and I privately discussed a few<br/>&gt; issues that would need to be addressed in combining the two<br/>&gt; approaches in a printed part, and we did agree that the idea was<br/>&gt; worth pursuing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p><p>***Just for the record:  I have a score of my woodwind quintet in<br/>Blackjack that has *both* the Sims *and* cents notation.

Over the past couple of days Dave Keenan and I have been<br/>&gt; discussing the issues you raised, and we seem to be coming to a<br/>&gt; general agreement about most of these.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, both of us have been swamped lately with other<br/>&gt; responsibilities involving deadlines, so we will need to delay<br/>&gt; posting our response for perhaps a few weeks.  We consider the<br/>issues<br/>&gt; that you raised very important, and we want to be able to give them<br/>&gt; the time and attention that they deserve (since we want to look at<br/>&gt; these things from a few different directions).  Besides that, we<br/>&gt; would be hard pressed at this time to keep up with the volume of<br/>&gt; messages that would follow our reply.  (In other words, we need a<br/>&gt; break!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope you understand this and take us at our word that we&apos;re<br/>serious<br/>&gt; about coming back to this (and not just blowing you off).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanking you in advance for your patience,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p><p>***Thanks, George and, of course, there is no rush with this.
