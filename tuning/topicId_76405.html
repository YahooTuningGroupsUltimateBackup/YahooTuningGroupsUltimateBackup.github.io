This we know.</p><p>As for lutes, it was never suggested that Bach couldn&apos;t compose for a lute<br/>tuning just as he could write for the Catholic church.  But ET?  We  know that<br/>Neidhardt lost a duel in tuning with Johann Nicholas Bach representing  the<br/>Bach family in Jena.  ET lost because it was not as singable  (cantabile).<br/>There is plenty, I think, to be found in the record.   Trouble is, as I see it,<br/>people are stuck in a mode of thinking and they can&apos;t  escape it.  Worse, they<br/>are invested in an earlier position and won&apos;t  budge.  Brad has actually shown<br/>some flexibility.</p><p>best, Johnny</p><p>Neil:  Hey, in all seriousness...maybe Bach really liked eq  temp...again, we<br/>don&apos;t know.
