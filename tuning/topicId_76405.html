This we know.</p><p>As for lutes, it was never suggested that Bach couldn&apos;t compose for a lute<br/>tuning just as he could write for the Catholic church.  But ET?  We  know that<br/>Neidhardt lost a duel in tuning with Johann Nicholas Bach representing  the<br/>Bach family in Jena.

Brad has actually shown<br/>some flexibility.</p><p>best, Johnny</p><p>Neil:  Hey, in all seriousness...maybe Bach really liked eq  temp...again, we<br/>don&apos;t know.
