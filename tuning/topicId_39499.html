That&apos;s partially because quartertones are so<br/>established in the contemporary repertory.  That&apos;s one reason that<br/>music composition software manufacturers like *Sibelius* pretty much<br/>*have* to include quartertone options.  So we&apos;re at 50 cents, there...</p><p>Now, the &quot;smaller&quot; divisions, like the 1/6th tone at 33 cents or the<br/>1/12th tone at 17 cents are *new* to many performers.  So, sure, they<br/>are going to balk...

(Well, Partch became<br/>*very* successful on the overall... :)  Part of that, I believe, is<br/>the incorporation of the corporal... or, in other words, the<br/>*theatrical* element.  So, you never know what will tickle and<br/>audience&apos;s fancy... but it can&apos;t be dull, that&apos;s for certain!  :)</p><p>&gt; Is there some &quot;standard&quot; that some of the schools who teach<br/>Microtonal  skills that each &quot;graduate&quot; is expected to be able to<br/>demonstrate?</p><p>***There are no such courses and there are no such<br/>determined &quot;skills&quot; except, possibly, for the 72-tET training going<br/>on in Boston at the New England conservatory.  *They* are expected to<br/>master 1/12th of a whole tone, or the 17 cent interval as the<br/>smallest, as mentioned above...</p><p>Are<br/>&gt; they expected to be able to identify various &quot;tuning systems&quot; just<br/>by listening to their scales?</p><p>***They just study one.
