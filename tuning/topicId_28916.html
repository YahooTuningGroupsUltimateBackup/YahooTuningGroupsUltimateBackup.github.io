I do not think<br/>they provide a way to generalize to other situations than<br/>a collection of sequential partials (k, k+1, k+2).<br/>Accordingly, they miss a larger issue that is, I think,<br/>far more important.</p><p>In simplest form, the larger question is this: given a collection<br/>of (inharmonically related) partials, *how many* notes will be heard.<br/>Because of their focus on collections of sequential partials,<br/>the answer in their case is always &quot;one&quot;. Yet if you play around<br/>with inharmonic tones (bells provide a good non-electronic example)<br/>then you realize right away that sometimes you &quot;hear&quot; one tone,<br/>sometimes two, and sometimes more.<br/>(No doubt Paul will be happy to<br/>point out that current theories also ignore this!)</p><p>My reservation here is that until you know how many &quot;notes&quot;<br/>are sounding, it is not particularly meaningful to talk about<br/>what their pitches are.</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=28921 href="#28921">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2001 2:30:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., SETHARES@E... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Also, there are many musicians around here devoted to exploring non-<br/>&gt; &gt;JI harmony and/or inharmonic timbres, so these types of studies make<br/>&gt; &gt;a &quot;dang&quot; difference to them.

Also, the propensity of a chord to create a single<br/>clear virtual pitch represents an extra component of consonance, often more important than that<br/>due to the lack of beating/roughness between partials.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In simplest form, the larger question is this: given a collection<br/>&gt; of (inharmonically related) partials, *how many* notes will be heard.</p><p>My harmonic entropy model provides a way of attacking this problem, though currently<br/>calculations have been performed only for dyads. Conceptually, though, I think I&apos;m on the right<br/>track.</p><p>&gt; (No doubt Paul will be happy to<br/>&gt; point out that current theories also ignore this!)</p><p>Hmm . . . have you read Parncutt&apos;s book, _Harmony: A Psychoacoustical Approach_? One of<br/>the parameters he discusses is &quot;multiplicity&quot;, which is the apparant number of pitches in a chord.<br/>Parncutt was one of the two main inspirations for harmonic entropy theory, along with Van Eck.</p></div>
