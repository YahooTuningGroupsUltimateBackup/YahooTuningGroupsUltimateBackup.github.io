The fact<br/>&gt; &gt; that yours isn&apos;t as strong as someone with AP and 22 years of<br/>&gt; &gt; piano training doesn&apos;t mean you don&apos;t have one. The way you<br/>&gt; &gt; heard the Bach retunings is evidence of that, as you agreed<br/>&gt; &gt; the other night.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I already pointed out that the Bach retunings share a common<br/>&gt; rhythm, which makes them sound alike. And I think Gene said<br/>&gt; that more extreme transformations are possible which would<br/>&gt; still preserve much of the character of the piece -- such as<br/>&gt; to the Hungarian minor. In the &apos;90s when I first started<br/>&gt; fooling with tunings, I would retune familiar MIDI files to<br/>&gt; totally crazy 12-note scales. There&apos;s only so much damage<br/>&gt; you can do that way.</p><p>Part of the confusion is because I&apos;ve been using the term &quot;categorical<br/>perception&quot; as an umbrella term for a number of scale-internalization<br/>effects that are assumed to come from acculturation, but after reading<br/>this study I&apos;m going to change the terminology I use. Specifically,<br/>&quot;categorical perception&quot; is defined in the psychology literature as<br/>when a subject perceives stimuli along a sensory continuum in the<br/>following manner:</p><p>1. The labeling functions are &quot;sharp,&quot; that is, stimuli are<br/>consistently identified within the categories and there is a steep<br/>gradient between categories;<br/>2. There are peaks of discrimination at category boundaries while<br/>discrimination within categories is relatively poor; and<br/>3. There is congruence between obtained discrimination levels and<br/>those predicted on the basis of the listener&apos;s labeling function.</p><p>Note that by this definition, the whole point of categorical<br/>perception is that listeners have more difficulty discriminating<br/>between intra-category stimuli as they do with inter-category stimuli,<br/>and that it overall refers to a sort of perceptual warping effect. In<br/>other words, someone with a 12-based categorical perception would have<br/>a more difficult time differentiating between &quot;subminor thirds&quot; and<br/>&quot;minor thirds&quot; than between &quot;minor thirds&quot; and &quot;major thirds.&quot; So in<br/>the future, I&apos;ll simply use the term &quot;categorical perception&quot; to<br/>denote precisely this effect, which is the way it&apos;s actually defined<br/>in the psychology literature.</p><p>There are a lot of studies showing that most western listeners exhibit<br/>behaviors that would seem to derive from &quot;categorical perception&quot; to<br/>some degree (Krumhansl, Locke &amp; Kellar). The newer study that Keenan<br/>found, linked to below, was designed to improve on some of the<br/>shortcomings in the Locke &amp; Kellar study, and ended up showing that<br/>most non-musicians don&apos;t exhibit any evidence for categorical<br/>perception -at all.- They tested for the existence of these criteria<br/>directly and showed how it changes with respect to training. Here&apos;s<br/>the link:</p><p><a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/40285607">http://www.jstor.org/pss/40285607</a></p><p>And what they found was that the extent to which perceptual warping<br/>occurs is proportional to how well listeners perform on an interval<br/>identification test, which they chose to measure something like the<br/>&quot;musicality&quot; (unfortunate word choice) of the listeners. The listeners<br/>who performed best on this test exhibited the greatest degree of<br/>categorization. What I view as a fundamentally important result is<br/>that there was no evidence found at all for categorical perception in<br/>listeners in the group with the lowest ear training test scores.</p><p>Page &quot;211&quot; in this study, which is really page 6 or so in the PDF,<br/>says it all. You can see the characteristic plateau + steep gradient<br/>behavior of true categorical perception is demonstrated most for<br/>listeners who performed best on the test, and that the extent to which<br/>the behavior is exhibited increases with test scores. Further along in<br/>the study, you can also see that &quot;same/different&quot; discriminations had<br/>a peak near the major/minor category boundary only for the<br/>&quot;Hi-musical&quot; listeners, and that the &quot;lo-musical&quot; listeners had no<br/>peak at all.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen some of Paul&apos;s posts in the archives that assume that all<br/>western listeners exhibit the behavior to some degree:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27525">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27525</a></p><p>So I assume he&apos;s going off of the older Locke and Kellar study, and<br/>not this one. This would also seem to improve on Paul&apos;s understanding<br/>of categorical perception (whose writings in tuning and tuning-math<br/>are an excellent research review up to this point), as I&apos;ll discuss<br/>below. I&apos;ll pass this onto him and see what he says.</p><p>To me, this explains why folks like Paul and Keenan have always just<br/>immediately understood when I say things about categorical perception,<br/>and why Gene and Ryan have never really understood it, and why you&apos;ve<br/>always sort of understood half of the things I say about it, and the<br/>other half you disagree with. It&apos;s either something you experience or<br/>you don&apos;t, and if you don&apos;t then it sounds like the things someone<br/>from the other camp says aren&apos;t making any sense to you.

And the point of all this is that I think this notion of<br/>categorical perception - using the actual, psychological definition -<br/>gives us a concrete framework for discussing things like this<br/>collateral damage. For example, note what I said here (this was lifted<br/>right out of the study text):</p><p>&gt; Specifically,<br/>&gt; &quot;categorical perception&quot; is defined in the psychology literature as<br/>&gt; when a subject perceives stimuli along a sensory continuum in the<br/>&gt; following manner:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.

This by itself isn&apos;t evidence for<br/>categorical perception, however - it&apos;s only evidence that asked the<br/>subject to use discrete labels for a continuous percept. What WOULD be<br/>evidence for categorical perception is if you then tested the<br/>perceived difference between different stimuli, and found that all<br/>other factors being equal, there was a peak of discriminability near<br/>the categorical divide.</p><p>For example, if a highly trained western musician exhibited more<br/>difficulty in distinguishing between a &quot;supermajor second&quot; and a<br/>&quot;major second&quot; than between a &quot;supermajor second&quot; and a &quot;subminor<br/>third,&quot; even if you control for things like concordance, that&apos;d be<br/>evidence for something like categorical perception.</p><p>So this would seem to be the same thing as the &quot;collateral damage&quot; you<br/>speak of. Another area in which this happens is for things like vowel<br/>phonemes, which people tend to perceive categorically and in a manner<br/>consistent with the vowels used in their own language - then they<br/>switch to another language and they have trouble switching to the new<br/>set of phonemes.

This is just how I feel in an<br/>intuitive, imprecise way, and may not be what science says, but I find<br/>if I really get into a meditative state and focus in on these &quot;subtle,<br/>different shades,&quot; I can start to really hear things in a more direct<br/>way, and then form new labels. I can sort of chill out and expose<br/>myself to a new sound until it really hits me and I can feel it sink<br/>in. The thing for me is that it&apos;s always somewhat fragile. When I go<br/>back to play in 12-EDO, the differences become unimportant again by<br/>necessity, and it all falls apart.</p><p>What I&apos;ve found at this point is that there are these tuning-specific<br/>adaptations which occur: if I immerse myself in 22-EDO, I get<br/>wonderfully used to 11-limit harmony and porcupine, so that the 327<br/>cent intervals might seem to &quot;imply&quot; that they&apos;re an 11/9 over a<br/>larger chord in a certain context. And if I immerse myself in 16-EDO,<br/>I get to the point where I don&apos;t even really notice or care that the<br/>675 cent 3/2&apos;s are beating so much. But it all then falls apart when I<br/>go back to 12 for a few weeks or so. I&apos;ve even noticed some minor ways<br/>in which 12-EDO falls apart as well, with my AP misfiring for a few<br/>hours until I get reacquainted.</p><p>What I want to do is develop presets for these adaptations and just<br/>launch into them. Like we&apos;re about to play in 22-EDO? Reconfigure my<br/>brain into 22-EDO mode. And it&apos;s 16-EDO coming up? Get into the state<br/>where I don&apos;t care about the beating. Back to 12? Throw it all away<br/>and go into my super digital only 12 note AP realm. That&apos;s kind of<br/>where I&apos;m at. Hopefully that makes some kind of sense.</p><p>But, behind it all, I still find there are 12 things in my head -<br/>major thirds, minor thirds, etc. I feel like I&apos;m on the verge of this<br/>breakthrough where I can see what these tangled balls of yarn are<br/>really composed on - the whole munit thing so far is the trippiest<br/>I&apos;ve got - but I still can&apos;t get there. I can never tell, when I hear<br/>9/7 &quot;as&quot; a major third, wtf it means, no matter how much I seem to<br/>focus in and meditate.

It may be worthwhile here to clarify the distinction<br/>between phonetics and phonology, as it&apos;s at the crux of what I&apos;m thinking<br/>about here (sorry if you&apos;re already familiar with this, or if you just<br/>don&apos;t care). Commence blabbing:</p><p>Phonetics looks at the sound itself (and/or its manner of articulation). So<br/>looking at a &quot;phonetic category&quot; like [s], articulatory phonetics defines<br/>it as an &quot;unvoiced alveolar sibilant&quot; -- i.e. in terms of how it&apos;s<br/>articulated in the mouth and pharynx. There are endless possible<br/>refinements here -- how forceful, exactly where on the tongue or top of the<br/>mouth, amount of overlap with other sounds, etc. Acoustic phonetics would<br/>define [s] in terms of its spectral qualities -- noise level and frequency<br/>components, for example (or the formants of specific vowel sounds, for a<br/>more familiar example). In any case, we&apos;re talking here about how to<br/>determine what you are calling &quot;the exact same sound&quot;.</p><p>Phonology looks at sound within the context of a single language -- a<br/>phonological category (or &quot;phoneme&quot;) is bound up with how sounds can be<br/>interpreted by a speaker of a specific language -- this is where we get<br/>into issues like you point out in language learning. In phonology, the /s/<br/>phoneme (note the different bracketing convention) may support a range of<br/>phonetic articulations -- you and I may say /s/ a bit differently, but any<br/>English speaker will understand it as /s/. This may also depend in part on<br/>the phonological, semantic, and even sociological context of an utterance.</p><p>Being from New York, I tend sometimes to say the voiced version of the<br/>English /th/ phoneme (ideally a &quot;voiced interdental fricative&quot;) more like a<br/>[d] sound (a &quot;voiced alveo-dental plosive&quot;) -- but that doesn&apos;t prevent you<br/>from knowing my &quot;dat&quot; is actually the word &quot;that&quot;. When I was in France,<br/>though, this threw a curveball (an inswing?) to people less familiar with<br/>English.</p><p>So, it&apos;s phonological rules that govern different ways that &quot;the exact same<br/>sound&quot; may be interpreted, how different &quot;exact sounds&quot; may be interpreted<br/>as one phoneme, and which sounds simply carry no information (English<br/>probably wouldn&apos;t derive or generate the word &quot;zthbuiookl&quot;).</p><p>To point back toard music, I&apos;m curious whether there may be some parallels<br/>between the way we learn and interpret phonemes and the way we learn and<br/>interpret interval categories. You might extend the parallel by saying<br/>phonetic categories correspond to the exact frequencies and ratios.</p><p>/jc</p></div>
