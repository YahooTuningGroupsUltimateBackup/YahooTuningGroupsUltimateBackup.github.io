I just now noticed that I completely didn&apos;t say what I was<br/>actually doing. Thank you for the ideas, though.</p><p>Since each finger-hole is independent of position, only its size<br/>matters, opening two holes is essentially the same as adding two<br/>ratios. But since my fingers are limited in size, the amount added by<br/>each hole has to be small.</p><p>I can take any sized subset out of the set of 8 superparticulars and<br/>add them together by opening those specific holes. All of them closed<br/>makes 1/1, and all open makes 2/1. There are some notes that clearly<br/>lie on a diamond, like the ones I mentioned, but there are others that<br/>seem more like a CPS, for instance if I open 9/8 and 11/10 I get<br/>99/80, and there are a lot of these distant-key notes that I&apos;m not<br/>really sure how they relate to each other. I mean, I know how they<br/>relate to the fundamental and how they relate to their component<br/>finger-holes, but do they lie in a (incomplete) transposed diamond, or<br/>is it more complicated?</p><p>I know that there are overlaps in this set, I&apos;ve found them by<br/>accident, but I don&apos;t know what their pattern is, so I wonder if there<br/>is any way to enumerate the entire set without calculating all 256<br/>fingerings.</p><p>As for timbre, the one I use right now is made by clamping my hands<br/>together, and I think that a softer material adds significantly to the<br/>harmonics. For this one I will probably use modeling clay, and add a<br/>soft resonator like on a kazoo.</p><p>On 1/5/07, Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@yahoo.com">clumma@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  I don&apos;t know anything about the ocarina (I assume the spellings<br/>&gt;  are interchangeable?).

To make sure, it is probaby wise to start aus with an as globular design as possible. The perfect string and the perfect ocarina (probably realizable with beatehn ballons minus the high-pitched sound of the tightened skin) work on two very different principles with the cylindricality (I HAD to write this) of real-life wind instruments as compromised strings with volume-dependent and correction.</p><p>But as far as I can remember, it (pitch being dependent on volume and area of the opening[s]) is true for infinitely thin walls. So forget about clay, try origami!</p><p>I guess a design of any shape with the holes all being in one plain could also work (I&apos;m thinking of recorders with all finger holes covered and the end hole manipulated on the knee).</p><p>klaus</p></div>
