Going back to the 16th century (the Renaissance), tonality had<br/>not yet formed, so many pieces from that period would sound far more weird<br/>to modern ears than Baroque pieces. Finally, going back to the period we<br/>were actually discussing, the period of medieval polyphony (~900-1450),<br/>5-limit (triadic) harmony had not yet become part of the style, so this<br/>music would probably sound positively alien to you.</p></div>
