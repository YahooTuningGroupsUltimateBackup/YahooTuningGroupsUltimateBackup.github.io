Its tonality, if you prefer. You have to imagine that the real single curve would have<br/>need<br/>to pile up vertically 5 octaves.

For example, differentially-coherent scales allow your listening<br/>to focus on difference tones, of which generating tones can be perceived as<br/>partials. An interval becomes a timbre, and a scale a collection of musical<br/>timbres. A plurarity of levels of audition is available.<br/>Also, while we generally think musical notes in a scale as single,<br/>the application of differential coherence often reveals their multiple facets,<br/>which in interaction with the other tones of the context, become melodic.<br/>You can refine about any scale that way, with appropriate instruments.<br/>My article in the last 1/1 journal of the Just Intonation Network explains all this.<br/>But there is no need to talk more about it, you have to experience it - I gave<br/>several examples on this list you can try for a start.</p></div><h3><a id=43488 href="#43488">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2003 12:41:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, jacques dudon &lt;aeh@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Gene Ward Smith wrote :<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, jacques dudon &lt;aeh@f...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;The principle (of differential coherence) can be explained as<br/>&gt; &gt; follows:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;     If f1 and f2 belong to a given set and we find that 2^n(f2 Â– f1)<br/>&gt; &gt; = f is a member of this set,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;     then the interval f1 : f2 is deemed to be &quot;coherent.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a definition, not a principle.
