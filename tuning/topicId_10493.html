A few pieces call for more than 12 notes per octave, using for<br/>example both G# and Ab, but these &quot;experimental&quot; pieces are a<br/>relatively small percentage of the total repertory.</p><p>The main possible exception that occurs to me is some lute music<br/>specifically assuming an instrument tuned in 12-tone equal temperament<br/>(12-tet), which becomes standard for lutes by around 1545 or<br/>so. However, some lute pieces from the earlier part of the century<br/>(e.g. Milan) may have been intended especially for a meantone tuning.</p><p>One choice that occurs to me is Antonio Cabezon, whose keyboard<br/>compositions sometimes highlight meantone intervals such as the<br/>augmented fifth (around 25:16) or diminished fourth (around 32:25)<br/>which have a &quot;special effect&quot; in this tuning, and add spice to the<br/>music.</p><p>Note, by the way, that if you tuned your lower manual in a usual Eb-G#<br/>meantone with 1/4-comma temperament (pure major thirds), and then<br/>tuned your second manual to the same scheme, but a meantone diesis<br/>(128:125 or ~41.06 cents higher), you&apos;d have a 24-note subset of<br/>Nicola Vicentino&apos;s basic 31-note tuning for his _archicembalo_ or<br/>&quot;superharpsichord.&quot; Here, instead of being a quartertone apart, the<br/>two manuals are about a fifthtone apart.</p><p>Incidentally, may I ask when your recital is scheduled? If there&apos;s<br/>time, I&apos;d be glad to offer more suggestions about repertory, maybe via<br/>e-mail.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
