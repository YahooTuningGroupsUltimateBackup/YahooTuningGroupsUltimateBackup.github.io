Had I remembered<br/>&gt;&gt; I would have added appropriate qualifiers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ok . . . upon reading my response to you again now,<br/>&gt; it seems a little harsh.  hope you didn&apos;t take it that way.</p><p>Never a problem. I get a little &quot;heady&quot; once in a while too (as I&apos;m sure<br/>you&apos;ve noticed) and appreciate a little latitude when I do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; now of course i must acknowledge that the word &quot;tritone&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; is used generically to mean *both* the &quot;augmented 4th&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; *and* the &quot;diminished 5th&quot; -- and  T H I S  is probably<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; more likely the result of keyboard-based thinking.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; You got it! *That&apos;s* the one I was talking about. The term<br/>&gt;&gt; is handy when referring to either (or both) &quot;inversions&quot; as<br/>&gt;&gt; they function (usually as dominant in common practice) in<br/>&gt;&gt; musical contexts .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ok . . . but it seems like you were describing the 12edo tritone<br/>&gt; (with the double meaning of aug4/dim5) as something special.</p><p>Actually, I was.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i want to point out that in 12edo it&apos;s no more special than<br/>&gt; the double enharmonically-equivalent meanings of any of the<br/>&gt; other intervals.  i.e., the aug1/min2, aug2/min3, maj3/dim4<br/>&gt; and their respective complements dim8/maj7, min7/aug6, min6/aug5.<br/>&gt;<br/>Aha! There&apos;s the rub. My point was and is that the tritone is the only<br/>*fifth* in the major key that is not perfect. That&apos;s why it&apos;s special. It<br/>creates the &quot;action&quot; in the dominant seventh chord and, because there is<br/>only *one*, it is the driving force in determining tonality. (Also see my<br/>response below [#10 Digest 1895] to Margo. It relates to this point.)</p><p>The other enharmonic dissonances you listed are of course seeking<br/>resolution, but only the tritone is unambiguous in its tonal destination,<br/>provided (in 12edo) that the dominant root is sounding . In flexible tuning,<br/>no root is needed when the larger (in my terms) tritone--augmented fourth<br/>with leading tone on top--tends to expand; and the smaller<br/>tritone--diminished fifth with the chord seventh on top--tends to contract.<br/>The only basic thing not predetermined is whether the destination chord will<br/>be major or minor. A &quot;deceptive&quot; cadence, of course, by its name, tends to<br/>prove the point.</p><p>Incidentally, the &quot;tritone&quot; that results by flatting scale step 6 in the<br/>minor mode is normally non-functional (in a modulatory sense) and that is<br/>apparently why composers traditionally attempted to &quot;hide&quot; it by inverting<br/>the diminished ii-chord to allow the strength of the subdominant pitch to<br/>override any directional pull it might engender. In flexible tuning, the<br/>flat-6 would likely tune differently--directly to 4 rather than to a<br/>dominant root (implied or sounding).</p><p>So, fire away, Monz, whenever something I say sounds strange to you. That&apos;s<br/>how I learn, and also how I find better ways of communicating my thoughts<br/>and reporting my experience.</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2002 12:33:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Aha!

The<br/>Aeolian mode is *not* equal to the minor mode. That makes no sense. The<br/>major/minor system is a *system* unto itself. The discovery of the<br/>importance of the tritone was paramount in developing the *functional<br/>harmony* that Rameou described (although I&apos;m not sure he noticed the<br/>importance of the tritone in the way we&apos;re discussing it). The difference<br/>between the major and minor mode, in my opinion, centers on the major and/or<br/>minor quality of tonic and subdominant chords. The dominant chord is major<br/>in both modes to preserve the &quot;action&quot; of the tritone.
