As I&apos;ve said before, 34 is amazingly<br/>precise and complete in representing a &quot;simple JI&quot; interlaced<br/>with more complex intervals which are the harmonic means of JI<br/>intervals. Hearing it this way you have to completely dump<br/>the literal 7/x and x/7 intervals, IMO- it&apos;s an aseptimal<br/>framework, though exactly as you say it is somehow &quot;tinged&quot; with<br/>&quot;7&quot; sound, perhaps because it is full of gentle relations to<br/>the 7th and 14th partials without getting close enough to<br/>them to create conflict? I don&apos;t know, but anyway- sounds good<br/>to me.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3><a id=73437 href="#73437">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

An<br/>&gt; emergency proceedure to unswell your head may be in order.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Whatever the size of my head, the hat that fits it must be doffed<br/>to you, oh master of internet sophistry. Your ability<br/>to change the subject, completely avoid any unpleasant questions,<br/>failure to acknowledge even the possible validity of any<br/>viewpoints that don&apos;t agree with yours, and generally sidetrack<br/>any discussion that doesn&apos;t fit into your interpretation<br/>of temperament is simply dazzling.</p><p>Anyway, for those living higher than the geneosphere, ie, have<br/>unravelled such Gordian knots as &quot;3:1 is not the same as 3:2&quot;, Aaron<br/>was saying, in reference to curious things about 34 equal divisions<br/>of an octave</p><p>&quot;My first thought is that a n-limit temperament is tinged by a given<br/>p-limit interval when there is an interval in the temperament that is<br/>(close-to) halfway between the nearest approximation to that p-limit<br/>interval and the p-limit interval itself (e.g. the way 22-edo tempers<br/>out 64/63, i.e. 16/9 and 7/4 are the &apos;same&apos;).&quot;</p><p>which is something I tried to discuss here some time ago, with<br/>Gene no less, or should I say, no more. And I think there&apos;s<br/>something to what Aaron says, which I can express in this crude but<br/>perhaps musical (therefore probably of little interest here) way:<br/>rather than ignoring or poorly approximating intervals<br/>related to a particular partial, it is a good idea to deal<br/>with them by substituting them, so to speak, with intervals<br/>that have a rhyme and reason of their own, in relation to<br/>strong interval families in the tuning.</p><p>For example, the fact that the seventh partial is so poorly<br/>incorporated, in a literal fashion, into 34 equal may actually<br/>be an advantage, superior to sloppy representations of intervals<br/>incorporating the seventh partial, as long as the intervals<br/>which are near where the x/7s and 7/xs &quot;might have been&quot; are<br/>well and consistently related to the tuning as a whole and good in<br/>and of themselves.</p><p>In 34, 9/7 and 7/4 can be taken this way (&quot;substituted&quot; respectively<br/>by the mediants of 14/11 and 9/7, and of 7/4 and 16/9). Where 7/6<br/>&quot;might have been&quot; we find the mediant of 7/6 and 13/11, and so<br/>on.  The spanner in the works might be 11/7, which is closely<br/>enough represented in 34 that it can be used pure in a 34 well- or<br/>ill-temperament. But maybe it&apos;s a &quot;key&quot; rather than a clunker, for<br/>the hypothetically &quot;7s-tempered-toward-11s&quot; intervals certainly<br/>sound lovely with it.</p><p>This brings in the idea of tempering-away-by-tempering-towards.<br/>For example, take the intervals you wish to temper, temporarily<br/>overly another offset scale and temper to, say, the harmonic<br/>means of the first and second set of intervals, moving in the<br/>directions you desire. The overlayed scale would be designed to<br/>hammer the original towards an ideal, whatever that might be.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
