In your research you seem<br/>to consider the shrutis all the time as just ratios. Many theorists do that<br/>as well: Alan Dani&eacute;lou for instance. I do have a TEXTBOOK OF INDIAN MUSIC,<br/>written in 1934 by Pt. Firoze Framjee, Poona. He brings all the ratios,<br/>commas etc, together into one system, confirming the &apos;ancient writings&apos; and<br/>nowadays practice, all the time using just ratios. The book is excellent in<br/>itself and I can you send a photocopy without any problem. I do have some<br/>doubts about it, though. I played the Indian sitar myself and had an<br/>excellent Indian teacher in Amsterdam. He tuned all the strings, including<br/>the ones used for resonance, simply by ear and it sounded all right to me.<br/>Much better than I could myself, using naively a 12-tet reference. The point<br/>is, today, when I tune the sitar which I have now, with a one cent accuracy,<br/>into a raga as proposed by Firoze Framjee, I simply hear a very clean,<br/>beatless result, exactly the same as hearing the single string piano tuned<br/>by Lou Harrisson. It doesn&apos;t correspond to what I heard from my teacher.<br/>Neither does it correspond to any record or CD I possess with Indian music.<br/>So, are just ratios really enough to explain Indian music, or is there some<br/>more? What about the melodic quality of all the steps?</p><p>Your English is excellent. I make many mistakes myself, but my ideas are not<br/>as complicated as yours. Post me privately in French, whenever you want.<br/>BTW, I do live in Paris.</p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div><h3><a id=11492 href="#11492">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

All other Indian instruments (not including<br/>the 12-tET harmonium) are variable-pitch, and the detailes expressive<br/>nuances of master players make references to a fixed grid of ratios somewhat<br/>arbitrary.</p></div>
