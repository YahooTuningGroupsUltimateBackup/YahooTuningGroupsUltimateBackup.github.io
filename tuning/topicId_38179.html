Since nobody else tried any of<br/>this, I decided to hear it for myself last night on the Scalatron.</p><p>I used a simulated-sawtooth waveform with the high end filtered out<br/>and tried clusters of tones in a couple of different octaves, both<br/>above and below middle C.  I found a problem in trying to hold down a<br/>whole octave of keys all at once, especially when trying to change<br/>the tuning quickly -- I needed one hand free to change the tuning.<br/>So the best I could do was to spread one hand out over as many keys<br/>as I could, which covered almost an octave.</p><p>I tried 12-ET, 17-WT (well-temperament, but close to 17-ET), 19-ET,<br/>22-ET, 24-ET, and 31-ET.  Of these, I thought that 12-ET was *least*<br/>dissonant and 17-WT most dissonant (even though it had fewer tones<br/>sounding than most of the rest).  The rest came pretty close to 17-WT<br/>in overall dissonance, and I concluded that the difference isn&apos;t<br/>significant enough to matter.</p><p>I seem to recall Ivor Darreg saying that adding more tones in a<br/>cluster brings you closer to white or pink noise, which would produce<br/>simultaneous beating at many different rates, causing the individual<br/>beats to become obscured in a hodge-podge of noise.  The result would<br/>sound less dissonant than overt beating.</p><p>On a related note, I once ran an experiment to determine the most<br/>dissonant intervals between the unison and the octave (in a middle<br/>register).  I concluded that they were (in order of decreasing<br/>dissonance) around 70 (~24:25), 1145 (~16:31), and 740 cents<br/>(~15:23).  The first of these intervals is very close to the single<br/>degree of 17-ET (and the average single degree of 17-WT), which might<br/>explain why 17-tone clusters sound so dissonant.  I also thought that<br/>the last of these intervals (very close to a meantone wolf fifth)<br/>used alone would have a more shocking effect in a composition than an<br/>entire cluster of semitones in 12-ET.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=38269 href="#38269">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2002 9:47:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; On a related note, I once ran an experiment to determine the most<br/>&gt; dissonant intervals between the unison and the octave (in a middle<br/>&gt; register).

I was also thinking of my graph, which shows consonance.  But<br/>it helps to remember which way is up.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So I would surmise that<br/>&gt; &gt; the peaks would also be approximations, give or take a few cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes, the harmonic entropy curve, i think, converges to a limit as N<br/>&gt; goes to infinity. with N finite, you&apos;re only taking the first N<br/>terms<br/>&gt; in the series, as it were, so there can be some &quot;wiggles&quot; in the<br/>&gt; approximation. in the limit, the minima of disssonance should nail<br/>&gt; the simple ratios perfectly, though it would be up to someone like<br/>&gt; gene to prove this mathematically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; if you&apos;d like to see a graph, i can make one; it&apos;ll look a lot<br/>like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the second graph here:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/harmentr.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/harmentr.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Don&apos;t go to a lot of trouble.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; too late -- i already did:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/default.gi">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/default.gi</a><br/>f</p><p>Something that I am suspicious about in your graph is that it doesn&apos;t<br/>shown enough local points of maximum consonance.  Between 5:4 and<br/>4:3, for example, I see a local minimum consonance at 448 cents<br/>without any indication that 9:7 is more consonant than a mistuning,<br/>something about which I had no doubt in my observations.  (The same<br/>could be said for 10:7.)  Now when it comes to an interval such as<br/>11:9 (or even 11:8), the difference between it and a mistuning is<br/>very subtle -- my graph exaggerates the difference (reflecting the<br/>fact that you can hear a lot more under laboratory conditions than<br/>you can in a musical performance) -- and I was completely unable to<br/>hear 16:13 or 17:14 as such -- but rather as points of local minimum<br/>consonance.</p><p>Perhaps there is not enough resolution in the vertical direction in<br/>your graph -- 7:6 and 9:5 barely show up as consonances -- and a<br/>higher resolution might make a difference for 8:7 and 9:7.

After trying different sizes of<br/>semitones<br/>&gt; &gt; in various keys, I came to the conclusion that 70 cents (~24:25)<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; very close (closer than, say, 63 cents, ~27:28) to the most<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonically dissonant semitone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t this *highly* dependent on register and timbre, though? maybe<br/>&gt; on loudness as well?</p><p>I noted above what sort of timbre I used in my observations with the<br/>electronic organ -- that was of a kind that I thought would be most<br/>valid in a general way.  Other timbres (particularly those that lack<br/>even partials or contain inharmonic partials) would give somewhat<br/>different results, but I was not interested in pursuing that<br/>specifically; I was only concerned with generalities.</p><p>Now register is another story.  Helmholtz&apos;s assertion that the<br/>consonance and dissonance of intervals depend on register (e.g.,<br/>major thirds in the bass being muddy, therefore dissonant) is tied to<br/>his observation that maximum dissonance is associated with a beat<br/>rate of about 32 Hz.  This means that my electronic organ experiment<br/>might have a different result for the local points of least<br/>consonance if the constant tone were, say, an octave higher.  Or it<br/>might not matter much, if you consider the following.</p><p>With my most recent experiments involving suspensions (to find the<br/>most dissonant semitone) I varied the timbres and registers somewhat<br/>in reaching my conclusion.  I found that there is more to dissonance<br/>that just the beat rate -- there is also a psychological perception<br/>conveyed by a semitone of a given size that conveys an impression of<br/>dissonance that seems to be less influenced by (if not independent<br/>of) the register in which it is heard.  In connection with this,<br/>consider our perception in comparing two major thirds, for example,<br/>mistuned by the same number of cents, one wide and the other narrow.<br/>There is a somewhat different psychological perception associated<br/>with each that is a function of size (but independent of beating)<br/>that will influence our perception of dissonance.  (Might this be<br/>that an interval&apos;s melodic properties also come into play when the<br/>interval is heard harmonically?)  I believe that something of this<br/>sort played a part in my conclusion that the 70-cent semitone is the<br/>most dissonant.</p><p>These things are rather elusive if your objective is to describe<br/>everything mathematically.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=38300 href="#38300">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/28/2002 2:10:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; ***This is really amazing stuff.
