Marco Tiella wrote a paper about his reconstruction of the archicembalo, that he made some years ago; the paper is available here:<br/><a href="http://www.muzykologia.uj.edu.pl/conference/papers/Marco">http://www.muzykologia.uj.edu.pl/conference/papers/Marco</a> Tiella.pdf<br/>and contains a reproduction of some drawings from Vicentino&apos;s treatise, among which the keyboards with their internal layout.<br/>The entire original treatise by Vicentino is available online on the TMI (Thesaurus Musicarum Italicarum):<br/><a href="http://pcm1671.labs.cs.uu.nl:6334/dynaweb/tmiweb/v/vicant/@Generic__BookView;cs=default;ts=default;lang=it">http://pcm1671.labs.cs.uu.nl:6334/dynaweb/tmiweb/v/vicant/@Generic__BookView;cs=default;ts=default;lang=it</a><br/>but images are not available yet.<br/>A photo of one of the keyboards, taken from the original treatise, is available here:<br/><a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/e-music/Music_extra.html#music28">http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/e-music/Music_extra.html#music28</a><br/>(maybe someone already published this link in this forum sometimes in the past).</p><p>As you can see, the internal shape of the split keys simply consists in having two regular, although narrow, levers for each split black key, each lever linked to its own devices as for the usual keys, and this is the common system used on the &quot;traditional&quot; keyboards.<br/>I saw a slightly different system on one of the organs of S. Petronio in Bologna, where the split keys consist in small levers coming out of the table above the keyboard, just above the usual black keys, but the split keys are an addition of the XVI Century there (the original organ is dating 1475).</p><p>Regards<br/>Leonardo Perretti</p></div><h3><a id=56185 href="#56185">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

I found that I wasn&apos;t liking the 4-foot very much and wasn&apos;t<br/>using it.  Therefore I was looking at doing some restringing and creative<br/>re-use of the 4-foot jacks with some minor keyboard retrofit modifications.<br/>In this case the approach of adding several split keys per octave to the<br/>traditional design seemed the way to go.</p><p>However, since then I&apos;ve discovered that the 4-foot stop is adjustable, not<br/>simply on-off, and as a result I can quickly and simply voice down the<br/>entire 4-foot section to a degree that makes it quite pleasant, and indeed<br/>wonderful.  By voicing down both sections I get considerable dynamic<br/>capability and I feel totally transported to the Appalachians with the<br/>wonderful delicate plucking with its wonderful harmonic responsiveness.<br/>[Getting off onto another topic there, though, so perhaps a new subject is<br/>appropriate for any replies to this paragraph.]</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=56187 href="#56187">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2004 5:42:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 10/29/04 10:10 AM, Leonardo Perretti &lt;<a href="mailto:dombedos@tele2.it">dombedos@tele2.it</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kurt Bigler wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Does anyone have any sources for diagrams showing the internal design of<br/>&gt;&gt; split-key mechanisms, e.g. in which D# and Eb are distinct, but on an<br/>&gt;&gt; otherwise &quot;traditional&quot; keyboard?
