He did his Ph.D work on Debussy. went to<br/>europe looked at his letters, the whole deal. This data was a personal<br/>communication from him. This I admit leaves room for error but this is what i<br/>remember and i remember it cause it didn&apos;t make sense to me then, nor really<br/>now. The impression I got was that double sharps are double flats were the<br/>points of difference. I wasn&apos;t able to break that code. That this work of<br/>Busoni was next to one of Debussy is quite curious and if this is how it<br/>happened, It would be a very out of character mistake of Jacks!<br/>................................................................................................................................</p><p>    Well in order to that  keep the rest of you all busy for a while. i think<br/>you are all missing the boat though, what about those composers who hears in<br/>microtones but didn&apos;t necessarily saw any reason to say anything. what about<br/>Bartok. Or stravinsky who wrote music on a &quot;terribly out of tune&quot;(Robert Craft)<br/>piano ( also he had a theory of harmony according to lucky Mosko that was based<br/>on combination tones, I am checking this one out as we speak), Or chopin who<br/>tuned his own piano to meantone (communication from Lou Harrison circa early<br/>80s) What about burmese piano music, put it back in Burmese tuning. Brittens<br/>Prince of Pagoda into slendro. Schoenberg Into 53 since he foresaw it use in<br/>the future and was held back only by the impracticability at the time. Doug<br/>Leedy has performed at least one song of Landini in 11 limit, when you get here<br/>let me know, you might sucker me into this. At this point considering my<br/>composition skills aren&apos;t up to snuff with the great old white boys up here who<br/>did the real groundbreaking microtonal work (after all they are where its<br/>at,yeah!), i think it would be presumptuous of me to consider myself a<br/>microtonal composer. I am considering going to electronics, unless their list<br/>is filled with similar type of endeavors. I don&apos;t think Tomita would be taken<br/>so seriously as his counterparts here :)<br/>(Sorry to consolidate all this on you message dan)<br/>If you are really really going to insist on this road take a clue for Margo&apos;s<br/>research and observations. In examining tunings influence on 13th century<br/>counterpoint, she has pointed out how the tuning of the day &quot;explains&apos; why<br/>they used the intervals the way they did. This  I have found valuable in that<br/>it is something applicable to subsequent styles in the same way that Yasser<br/>Harmonization of infra diatonic scales are in maybe a lesser degree. It<br/>supplies a springboard for speculation on a strong foundation.<br/>    Unless  examinations can explain how the hearing of a different tuning<br/>affected the writing of the music in some way differing than if it was heard in<br/>12et, i have to consider it off topic outside as a historical curiosity.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/4/1999 7:42:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig, can you imagine how uncomfortable each of us gets when the discussion<br/>goes to one of our weaknesses?

The cost they charge<br/>make it impossible for the many to even consider going into &quot;fine arts&quot;. There<br/>is just to much money to pay back. I was talking to a head of an art dept. at a<br/>university just last night and he told me there is a larger Graphic Design dept.<br/>than the whole rest of the art dept. put together. The universities have created<br/>a situation where only individuals from an upper class can consider being an<br/>artist. If all our artist come from this class, what does that say about<br/>society.<br/>    It&apos;s kinda a reverse Psychology. :) If i make enough noise maybe they will<br/>give me a job to shut me up:)</p><p>&gt; For me, I find that one foot in the past and one foot in the future is the<br/>&gt; only way to live the present.

We will pummel them until they<br/> behave!  Everything must be EXACTLY as originally conceived!!<br/>  &gt;&gt;</p><p>In my scores, the pitches and rhythms are prescribed, if they&apos;re not right<br/>then one is not playing the piece. (I could also put it this way: if you<br/>don&apos;t like the pitches and rhythms I&apos;ve notated, why do you want to play the<br/>piece?).   In the domains of articulation and dynamics, my notation is rather<br/>sparse.  Some of my pieces are in open score (without specific instruments),<br/>others invite ornamentation.  So there is plenty of room for the player&apos;s<br/>sensibilities,  just not in the areas I have notated.</p><p>&lt;&gt;</p><p>You can still go to the Rodin foundation in France and order a new casting of<br/>one of his works.  His sculptures are on exhibition several times at the same<br/>time in different places.  I grant that some art works will always be<br/>one-offs, but visual artists have long been comfortable in this age of<br/>mechnical reproduction. What&apos;s wrong with the analogy?</p><p>You wrote:</p><p>&lt;&lt; You graciously &quot;allow&quot;<br/>those who have already proven themselves in your eyes the right to have<br/>done what they&apos;ve done, but evidently, if you had been there, before<br/>these people proved themselves (in your eyes), you would have done your<br/>best to explain to them that they had no right to do it!</p><p>Either that, or you&apos;re saying that, if any discussion comes up, that<br/>fact in and of itself proves the unworthiness of a project, and<br/>presumably the person in question will cease and desist immediately<br/>upon notification of your (or anyone&apos;s) disapproval.  &gt;&gt;</p><p>Obviously you did not read what I had written:</p><p>&gt; But this has got to be<br/>&gt;done with honesty about the nature of the re-composition, convincing<br/>&gt;rationale for the critique implied by the project, and enough touch of<br/>&gt;inspiration or virtuosity that discussion is unnecessary.</p><p>Experiment, by all means, every musician does it!  Most do it in private, as<br/>a means of digging out details in the music, but when it is more than details<br/>and done in public, please present it as an experiment or a new composition<br/>and not as a reproduction of the original composer&apos;s intent.  If you wish to<br/>do that, then the level of evidence required to support the claim is<br/>extremely high.</p><p>Your Bach retunings are interesting, but to my ears only demonstrate how much<br/>his voice leading technique was determined by the resources and limitations<br/>of temperaments.  Virtually all of Bach&apos;s works -- the solo cello and violin<br/>pieces are the great exceptions -- included keyboard instruments, whether as<br/>solists or as continuo instruments, and there is no evidence that Bach used a<br/>keyboard with more than 12 pitches to the octave. While his private<br/>clavichord playing might have used a lot of _Bebung_  (thus allowing him to<br/>bend pitches upwards a bit, as well as to use vibrato to disguise the<br/>intonation), all of his public performances were made with 12 tones of<br/>meantone or a well temperament.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
