I was asking for one period of this<br/>lattice, which I could construct myself, but maybe others<br/>here could not, so I thought maybe it would be most<br/>appropriate for you to do it.  And besides, I might make<br/>a mistake, and that would result in plenty of confusion.</p><p>&gt; periodic and we could draw a few periods to get the idea.</p><p>One period should do it.</p><p>&gt;And do you mean a 5-limit, 7-limit, or 11-limit-sans-9s<br/>&gt;lattice.</p><p>5-limit, since we&apos;ve been discussing and notating porcupine<br/>in terms of 5-limit music, and since they&apos;re easiest to draw<br/>and see.</p><p>&gt;Actually, I don&apos;t want to draw any of them.</p><p>In a sense this is equivalent to not drawing them, since if<br/>you drew them you must have wanted to.  Internally, though,<br/>it may be that parts of you want to draw them, but not enough<br/>to get you to do it.  In this case, I have no desire to sway<br/>you; I&apos;ve always believed in never doing anything I didn&apos;t<br/>want to.  And so far, it hasn&apos;t knocked me out of the richest<br/>tiny percentile of humans that I was born into, where I had<br/>the luxury of formulating it in the first place, so it can&apos;t<br/>be too bad of an idea.</p><p>I should really stop skipping dinner.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
