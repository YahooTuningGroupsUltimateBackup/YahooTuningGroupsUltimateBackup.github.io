A major third of 9/7 is larger even than the Pythagorean 81/64,<br/>&gt;which is itself larger than ET12. They would be good as D# and A#,<br/>&gt;though even then the major third from B to D# is flatter than just.</p><p>If you&apos;re going to demand a logical notation here, start by noticing that<br/>the fifth from D to A is flatter than just.</p></div>
