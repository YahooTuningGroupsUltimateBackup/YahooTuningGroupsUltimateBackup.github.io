Wow.  Those are<br/>interesting in conjunction with the tetrads!

I&apos;m having trouble<br/>visualizing it at the moment...  I&apos;m sure it&apos;s not as good as your &quot;C<br/>as B standard&quot; but I *do* have some problems with that which are<br/>pretty self-evident, but which I&apos;ll elaborate on shortly (and<br/>briefly...)</p><p>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s true, I like that long chain on the lattice with *naturals*<br/>&gt; &gt; rather than quarter-tone flats as they exist presently...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My current electronic piece needs to remain in C-F-G, but the<br/>next piece, for cello, will be in the C-G-D-A standard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fabulous.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, it only makes sense after a near sleepless night and paranoia.<br/>Thanks a *lot* Dave for these &quot;improvements...&quot;   :)</p><p>Naturally, I&apos;ll want to work with the *naturals* so I can imagine<br/>lots of open strings in this piece.  In fact, so nice open string<br/>drones might be nice... and still in Blackjack, of course, with this<br/>new system!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Let&apos;s hope we *keep* that standard for awhile!

It has the advantage of having its point of symmetry nearer the middle of the keyboard.</p><p>Whereever middle-C ends up, if you need it as a reference you can easily mark it in some way, and will soon learn it. It&apos;s only one note. There are 60 others to learn (of varying degrees of importance). I want to find the keyboard layout that will make it easiest to learn the most important ones.</p><p>We might also look at what layouts put the maximum number of 7-limit (otonal?) tetrads or 9-limit pentads on a 61 note keyboard.
