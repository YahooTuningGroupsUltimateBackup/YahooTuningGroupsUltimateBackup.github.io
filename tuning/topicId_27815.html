In the most obvious<br/>definition, microtonality (from Greek _mikro_, &quot;small&quot;) is the use of<br/>intervals smaller than the usual whole-tones and semitones of the<br/>best-known Western European compositional traditions, although the use<br/>of such intervals is a routine feature of many world musics.</p><p>(2) MICROTONALITY AS THE USE OF &quot;UNUSUAL&quot; INTERVALS OR TUNINGS. In a<br/>second and related definition broadening the first, microtonality is<br/>the use of any interval or tuning system deemed &quot;unusual&quot; or<br/>&quot;different&quot; in a given cultural setting -- in many 20th-21st century<br/>settings, for example, just about any tuning for keyboard or guitar<br/>other than a division of the octave into 12 equal semitones (12-tone<br/>equal temperament, or 12-tET). The composer Ivor Darreg&apos;s concept of<br/>_xenharmonics_, which it is tempting to describe in a paraphrase of<br/>the Latin poet Terence as the conviction that &quot;nothing intonational is<br/>alien to me,&quot; seems synonymous with this sense of &quot;microtonal.&quot;</p><p>(3) MICROTONALITY AS A MUSICAL CONTINUUM OR DIMENSION. In a third<br/>definition, microtonality is simply the dimension or continuum of<br/>variation among intervals and tuning systems, embracing _all_ musics.</p><p>==</p><p>The third definition makes microtonal mean tuning, so why not just<br/>say tuning? The second definition makes a Slendro scale microtonal,<br/>which seems to indicate a word without &quot;micro&quot; in it should be found<br/>instead--eg, xenharmonic.</p></div><h3><a id=27817 href="#27817">ðŸ”—</a>X.
