It is no<br/> wonder that Western texts (from guitar magazines to Persichetti&apos;s _Twentieth<br/> Century Harmony_) often give the &quot;pelog&quot; scale as C Db Eb G Ab, but that is<br/> of course a great distortion. &gt;&gt;</p><p>It depends upon whether you&apos;re talking about a single, five-toned pelog<br/>pathet or a pelog system which is tempered to accomodate more than one<br/>pathet. It has not been established that a characterisation like C Db Eb G Ab<br/>will not be adequate to describe the former case;  for Campur Sari groups --<br/>where electric 12tet instruments play together with pelog instruments -- it<br/>seems to be adequate, for Karawitan, classical Javanese music, it probably<br/>would not be. Interestingly, von Zant&apos;s measurements of Sundanese kechapi<br/>tunings also show that a 12tet representation is probably adequate for pelog,<br/>melog and degung, but not for salendro. I find this remarkable because one<br/>would expect some preference for just intervals with stringed instruments<br/>that is simply not to be found.</p><p>My article _Speculum Pelogi_, in Xenharmonikon XI (1989) discusses some of<br/>this, especially the mapping of three pathet onto 7 tones out of 9 equal, a<br/>model considered theoretically in Sunda, but it is in need of some serious<br/>updating, especially concerning the possibility of making _seleh_ intervals<br/>more _pleng_ (beatless) than others.</p></div>
