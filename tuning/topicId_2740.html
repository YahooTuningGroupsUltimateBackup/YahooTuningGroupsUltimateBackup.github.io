My kind of<br/>&gt; inconsistency is one of approximations to JI by ETs and can never<br/>&gt; arise in Just Intonation itself.</p><p>I apologize for extrapolating the concept into an area where you<br/>didn&apos;t intend it to be used.</p><p>What I meant by &apos;in the Erlichean sense&apos; was that in Johnston&apos;s<br/>notation, adding two intervals with the same &apos;type of spelling&apos;<br/>sometimes results in an interval that requires a different<br/>&apos;spelling&apos;, in the same way that adding the best approximations<br/>of two ET intervals sometimes results in an interval whose best<br/>approximation in that ET uses a different &apos;spelling&apos; than the one<br/>that results from the addition.</p><p>Is there any name or formal [mathematical] description for this<br/>type of inconsistency?</p><p>&gt; Joe Monzo wrote [re: Schoenberg&apos;s _Harmonielehre_],<br/>&gt;&gt; The inconsistency that Erlich would point out would have called<br/>&gt;&gt; these notes Bb, F#, and C#.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Never. That&apos;s yet another kind of consistency concept that<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t be further divorced from my own. Using the Erlich<br/>&gt; consistency that one gets with stretched partials, I would call<br/>&gt; these notes B, F#, and C#.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hmmm... I never knew you were using stretched partials in your<br/>consistency definition.</p><p>Again, is there a more formal description of this kind of<br/>inconsistency?

This is the same procedure you used in your transcription of Partch&apos;s system into 144-tET. In both cases,<br/>you not only violate the most basic principle behind Erlich consistency, which is that<br/>the consonant ratios and only the consonant ratios must be approximated as well as possible, but you also introduce another kind of inconsistency<br/>by approximating the same ratio in different ways in different parts of the scale.</p></div>
