But I think this<br/>&gt; underscores some of the problems as well. The &quot;miracle scale&quot; is not a<br/>&gt; scale paradigm at all in the diatonic sense where there&apos;s a symbiotic<br/>&gt; correspondence between a horizontal and a vertical structure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s a lot of unanswered (but fascinating) questions beyond the<br/>&gt; 5-limit. One of which is what kind of paradigm shift might be<br/>&gt; necessary to accommodate a horizontal concept that&apos;ll accompany higher<br/>&gt; harmonics in their readymade horizontal sense... whether by the weight<br/>&gt; of acculturation or some innate psychoacoustic threshold, clearly a<br/>&gt; &quot;white key&quot; concept collapses pretty quickly once the scale expands<br/>&gt; very much beyond 7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What could a non generalized diatonic diatonic be... any ideas?<br/>&gt;</p><p>The &apos;scale tree&apos; idea can lead one up from a &quot;lotta notes&quot; to<br/>something &quot;white key&quot; like.</p><p>for instance (pause for quick &apos;grep&apos;)...</p><p> +-------------------Blackjack-21-MOS-improper-CS------------+<br/> 2  9 16 23 30 37 44 51 58 65  0  7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70</p><p> 2 5 2 5  2  5  2  5  2  5  2  5  2  5  2  5  2  5  2  5  2<br/>0 2 7 9 14 16 21 23 28 30 35 37 42 44 49 51 56 58 63 65 70</p><p>Grahams 10 note scale</p><p>  7   7     7     7     7     7     7     7     7     7   2<br/>0   7   14    21    28    35    41    49    56    63   70</p><p>or try to push it up in a different direction and come across<br/>this gem, the &quot;neutral ionian&quot; (perhaps this was named something<br/>else as I didn&apos;t see it pop up all by its lonesome like this).</p><p>  9   12   9    12   9   12    9<br/>0  150  350  500  700 850  1050  1200 (cents now)</p><p>and lots of others...</p><p>        (growing out of a septimal pentatonic!)</p><p>    16         12       16             12       16<br/>  7    9       12       7     9        12       7     9<br/>  2 5  2 5  2  5  2  5  2  5  2  5  2  5  2  5  2  5  2  5  2</p><p>There are a lot of ways to play this game and some of them might<br/>lead somewhere.

So this octatonic scale is melodically<br/>similar to 22322322 (a mode of 18-EDO).
