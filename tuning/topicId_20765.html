It is as if one could hear only<br/>&gt;three frequencies, and got all the colour timbres from the relative<br/>&gt;strenght<br/>&gt;of those three frequencies.</p><p>In order to answer Sarn&apos;s question, I&apos;d go a little further, though. To each<br/>point in the visual field, the eye and brain assign only one color. This<br/>color is, as Robert says, dependent on the relative strengths of the<br/>responses of the three color sensors. These color sensors have overlapping<br/>ranges of sensitivity, so that any possible electromagnetic frequency within<br/>the visible range will be seen as a certain color. However, combining lots<br/>of frequencies will still result in only one color -- it&apos;s still only the<br/>strengths of the responses of the three color receptors that affects what<br/>color we see. By using lots of little red, green, and blue pixels<br/>(corresponding to our three color receptors), our TV screens and computer<br/>monitors can simulate almost any frequency or combination of frequencies<br/>that occur in nature. Our eye won&apos;t know the difference.</p><p>With sound, the situation is completely different. We can hear multiple<br/>instruments at the same time, and they don&apos;t necessarily combine to sound<br/>like a single instrument (that only happens if they&apos;re playing simple otonal<br/>chords including the unison). There is this phenomenon of timbre which has<br/>no analogue in the visual realm. If the ear is sensing a bunch of<br/>frequencies, the brain will parse these into approximate harmonic series and<br/>assign to each a timbre based on the relative strengths of the partials in<br/>the series, and a pitch based on the frequency of the fundamental (even if<br/>physically absent) of the series. This probably evolved as a result of vocal<br/>sounds being primarily composed of harmonic spectra, and an ability to<br/>separately hear various vocal sounds provided an evolutionary advantage.</p><p>Visual spectra of chemical elements result from electrons in atoms jumping<br/>between energy states. A given atom will be able to produce various<br/>electromagnetic frequencies corresponding to the differences between these<br/>states, so a given atom will have something roughly analogous to a &quot;harmonic<br/>series&quot;. However, (a) the visible range is very narrow, and most atoms won&apos;t<br/>have more than one or two frequencies within the visible range; and (b) most<br/>materials are composed of molecules, rather than isolated atoms -- and<br/>molecules have a much more complicated set of energy states. So we see that<br/>it would be really difficult to conceive of something like a &quot;timbre&quot; for<br/>visual stimuli, and even if we could, we did not evolve in such a way as to<br/>be able to see &quot;timbrally&quot; . . .</p><p>Synaesthesia is a completely different matter, though . . .</p></div><h3><a id=20778 href="#20778">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2001 11:32:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>&gt; Visual spectra of chemical elements result from electrons in atoms jumping<br/>&gt; between energy states.

I know that<br/>radar is often turned into sound, but haven&apos;t heard of it being done for a<br/>region of the spectrum including light.</p><p>I wonder, perhaps as you say, few of the colours we see would be perceived as a kind of timbre<br/>However, reason I think would be that most will have a large continuous component.</p><p>I think if the lines were discrete, would be perceived as a timbre, either<br/>harmonic or inharmonic.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I&apos;m convinced that only harmonic series can form a timbre. What about<br/>bell sounds. Bell makers use the sequence<br/>1/12, 1/6 1/5 1/4 1/3.<br/><a href="http://www.oakcroft13.fsnet.co.uk/lehr.htm">http://www.oakcroft13.fsnet.co.uk/lehr.htm</a></p><p>That looks as if it has been selected from the utonal rather than the otonal series.</p><p>Plus, one just does perceive instruments with inharmonic timbres as having an identity<br/>as an instrument does one not. Here is anohter suggestion: if one hears a note,<br/>then hears the same pattern of partials translated to another pitch, maybe somehow<br/>one keys into that pattern as a timbre? Probably with the harmonic series pattern<br/>being favoured as it is so prevalaent, and as you say, it would have evolutionary<br/>signficance for picking out voices, but I imagine it isn&apos;t the only one that<br/>will work.</p><p>After all, one also wants to pickout other kinds of sounds, say, the sound<br/>of a branch or twig breaking under foot, which has a kind of characteristic<br/>&quot;timbre&quot;, while varying in pitch, and I don&apos;t think it is particularly harmonic.</p><p>Or, the sound of the wind, and other natural sounds, which may have been highly<br/>significant for early hominids!</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=20780 href="#20780">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
