Rather, what I&apos;m taking to task is the general scientific assumption that the only way the harmonic series applies to music is by creating boundary conditions eg the string length b/w nut and bridge giving frequencies 1, 2, 3, etc... so that harmonies are created by adding upper harmonics to the fundamental. What this model does not take into account is the fact that the same conditions of rational-periodicity apply b/w two or more boundary conditions themselves AND ALSO when no boundary exists at all. All that is required for a tonic/fundamental to be produced is that the two frequencies bear a rational relation, the resultant wave giving a number of cycles corresponding to the GCD.<br/>eg: we all &apos;know&apos; that given the two freq&apos;s 6 and 9, the resultant frequency will be 3. Their appearance together puts them in the role of 2nd and 3rd harmonics to tonic 3. Observe also that taking the harmonic series of 6 and 9 will give each harmonic as a GCD; 12 and 18 have GCD 6, 18 and 27 have GCD 9, and so on. Thus, two violins when played simultaneously can produce a third harmonic series comprised of GCD&apos;s. Obviously it does not matter whether the frequencies are generated by a computer or a kazoo.</p><p>In my considered opinion, failure to recognise this subtle distinction has led scientists to underestimate the role that musical harmony actually plays in their underlying philosophy. It has also left the impression that mathematics is somehow more fundamental and important than musical harmony, that we impose maths onto music rather than vice-versa (PHI being one example. Why is the Fibbinachi series more &apos;natural&apos; than the harmonic series?). In view of the fact that both light and matter are also waves and that all waves display the same behaviour, I would suggest that it is rather the other way around.</p><p>So if this is correct, the million dollar question for the tuning group is and has always been: where does this leave irrationals (especially considering the commonality of 12 edo)? One possible explanation is that the irrationals themselves are an idealisation, that in reality the notes with which we are familiar are rational harmonics in the higher registers (i.e. perhaps we can only discern to a few decimal places?). Since the tonic needs to be 8ve to the tonic frequency, I propose that we should look for a tuning system based on minor third 609/512 and major third 645/512. These not only have the correct tonic of 512 as 2 power of 9, but also  correctly approximate their irrational counterparts to 4 decimal places. OR as I have been trying to find out with Carl/Erlich&apos;s Entropy model, is there a certain &apos;give&apos; around the number of cycles for each interval, or such a thing as &apos;almost periodic&apos;? These seem to me to be the most pressing problems for a group committed to tuning (which can/should also mean tuning our ideas with practice).</p><p>I hope this makes things a little clearer.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=82278 href="#82278">ðŸ”—</a>djtrancendance@...</h3><span>3/22/2009 7:40:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>---so that harmonies are created by adding upper harmonics to the fundamental.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right meaning...adding notes that intersect the harmonic series of the root note (if I have it right).&nbsp; Then again (if I have it right), that&apos;s what Sethares does, only for things like 10TET he &apos;de-stretches&apos; the overtones/timbre to match the new &apos;shrunk&apos; (vs. 12TET) tuning.</p><p>--All that is required for a tonic/fundamental to be produced is that the<br/>two frequencies bear --a rational relation, the resultant wave giving a<br/>number of cycles corresponding to the GCD.<br/>---eg: we all &apos;know&apos; that given the two freq&apos;s 6 and 9, the resultant frequency will be 3.<br/>---Their appearance together puts them in the role of 2nd and 3rd harmonics to tonic 3.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Right meaning...given two harmonics/overtones you can automatically derive where the root/bottom tone of the series is (it is the GCD).&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW, I have to clarify myself: when I say &quot;sounds harmonic&quot;, I mean that it sounds revolved rather than matches the mathematical construct explained above (which, of course, also sounds resolved).

If we played the harmonics of the &gt; harmonics series 1 to 15 at the same, for example (anything without &gt; the excessive beating of harmonics 19+), it would likely sound more &gt; natural than PHI mean-tone.<br/>&gt;   One slight problem: we&apos;d only have about one area (near harmonics &gt; 7-14 or 8-16) that would actually fit at least 7 notes per 2/1 &gt; octave.

And with JI, as you know from music theory, the &gt; majority of combinations of notes make sour chords (which is why &gt; music theory is so complex...and important with diatonic scales),<br/>&gt;    These realistic restrictions of using the harmonic series as a &gt; scale make me reconsider PHI.  With scales derived from a PHI tuning &gt; I can get pretty close to a &quot;scale that is a chord&quot; (IE very hard to &gt; find sour combinations of notes) without the above mentioned &gt; limitations of using the harmonic series as a scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --One possible explanation is that the irrationals themselves are an &gt; idealisation, that in ---reality the notes with which we are &gt; familiar are rational harmonics in the higher registers<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Could be.  Or they could simply be very near rational &gt; values...enough so that the ear barely notices (IE in my rational &gt; version of the irrational PHI scale).

The fifth of LucyTuning is 4.5 cents from 12TET.  The minor third is already 13.5 cents away.  The 12 note circle of fifths fails to close with an interval of about a quartertone.

And both of these, I believe, &gt; sound better than non-adaptive JI...because in regular JI some interval become &gt; severely skewed/tense for the sake of making other intervals pure (which &gt; explains the necessity of having some many different JI scales and not just &gt; one). :-P</p><p>What do you mean by &quot;Wilson&apos;s MOS scales&quot;?

I myself prefer just intonation over temperaments to compose in. However, this may not mean that irrational ratios have no value at all in music. Context is everything here: some pieces may sound better in just intonation, whereas others (that do not rely on stable consonant sonorities) may sound better in LucyTuning or 23-edo or 88-cet or some other irrational tuning.</p><p>I noticed in composition and improvisation that the tuning system (and the scales used) imparts its mood on the music being played. One of the advantages of LucyTuning seems to be (this is what I understood from the website) that it can be used to approximate a wide range of tunings (from other cultures or otherwise). For example, I found that every fourth generator from LucyTuning makes an excellent 22-tET, whereas more conventionally minded musicians might prefer to use LucyTuning as a meantone. I do not see this versatility in other meantones such as 1/4 comma (where the major third is a bad magic generator) or just intonation (where neither the perfect fifth nor major third is a good generator for a linear temperament.)</p><p>Probably this versatility is what Charles means by &quot;best sounding intervals&quot;: I interpret this to mean that LucyTuning can provide a spectrum of sounds that can fit anyone&apos;s definition of &quot;best sounding&quot; using a reasonable number of generators.</p><p>As far as the justness of the 2:1 is concerned, I think that it is because the 2:1 is a universal phenomenon in the music of cultures who use instruments with harmonic or near-harmonic timbres. (The same can be said for 3:2 or 4:3, but probably not for 5:4, 6:5, 7:6 and more complex intervals.) Distorting the 2:1 would make music theory in LucyTuning unnecessarily complicated, and it would directly contradict the purpose of LucyTuning, which seems to be to represent all musical cultures with a unified theory.</p><p>(However, LucyTuning (or any other tuning for that matter) can be stretched to accomodate inharmonic timbres.

For example,<br/>&gt; &gt; I found that every fourth generator from LucyTuning makes an excellent<br/>&gt; &gt; 22-tET, whereas more conventionally minded musicians might prefer to<br/>&gt; &gt; use LucyTuning as a meantone. I do not see this versatility in other<br/>&gt; &gt; meantones such as 1/4 comma (where the major third is a bad magic<br/>&gt; &gt; generator) or just intonation (where neither the perfect fifth nor<br/>&gt; &gt; major third is a good generator for a linear temperament.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s nothing special about LucyTuning here.  You get the<br/>&gt; usual meantone MOS scales and a good approximation to 88-tET<br/>&gt; (from which you can take a 22 note subset).  The third isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; a good magic generator either.  Enough fifths will<br/>&gt; approximate any interval to an arbitrary precision -- the<br/>&gt; same as quarter comma meantone, or pythagorean intonation,<br/>&gt; or various other JI subsets.</p><p>I agree. I myself am not a practitioner of LucyTuning (I prefer extended 7-limit just intonation, hence my pseudonym &quot;Justin Tone&quot;:-) It just happens to be that LucyTuning has a flat enough meantone generator that four of them makes a magic generator almost identical to 22-tET. This 22-tET connection is just a numerological coincidence, based on the fact that pi is very close to 22/7. This happens to be especially interesting as traditional musicians believe that 4 perfect fifths make a major third plus two octaves.</p><p>Other than meantone and magic, however, I see no other temperaments whose structures can be reasonably approximated with LucyTuning. The minor third, for instance, is too flat to be of any use for Kleismic temperament, and the minor second is too sharp for Miracle. There seems to be nothing even remotely resembling a subminor third for Orwell.</p><p>Of course, one can concoct a kleismic temperament out of LucyTuning with every 85th generator, and a miracle with every 906th generator. However, this (i.e. trying to change a tuning in the middle of a piece from meantone to kleismic by taking every 85th generator etc.) is extremely unlikely to appear in practical music. The ear simply cannot make the connection between a minor third and a chain of 85 fifths.</p><p>So, all in all, I feel that the use of 72-tET, just intonation and other tunings (even 11 and 13-tET) in xenharmonic music is much more enlightening and provides better tonal resources than LucyTuning. These other tunings I mentioned seem to give a better &quot;bang for the buck&quot; in terms of new intervals (why would you want to use a chain of 85 fifths for a single minor third with 72 notes can make a complete kleismic scale in itself?) as well as unexplored possibilities that, by nature, are not consistent with a Western meantone-biased tuning like LucyTuning.</p><p>Praveen Venkataramana</p><p>P.S. Pi-based scales can be intellectually stimulating, and I think that they do not always have to be based on meantone. I can easily conjure up new Lucy-like scales with other temperaments, such as a &quot;LucySchismic&quot; scale with generator [8 * 2^(1/pi)]^(1/8) to fit Indian srutis, and a &quot;LucyMiracle&quot; scale with generator [2^(1 - 1/pi)]^(1/7).

I don&apos;t see why</p><p>there should be anything specially bad about JI and I</p><p>thought your 9 note solution used JI anyway.</p><p>&gt; --It&apos;s relevant if you&apos;re trying to</p><p>&gt; --tune an instrument.</p><p>&gt; It wasn&apos;t obvious to me the first message concerned instrument tuning at all</p><p>&gt; beyond that, for example, by coincidence dividing the string into 1/3 produced a</p><p>&gt; &quot;3rd&quot; tone.</p><p>If you care about what another message concerned you&apos;d</p><p>better reply to that message so that we know the context.</p><p>The reply I gave was to a direct question about the</p><p>usefulness of ratios.  You didn&apos;t say anything about</p><p>dividing a string.  Ratios are used when you tune an</p><p>instrument to match partials or harmonics.</p><p>&gt; ---Which is sort of the point of this list.</p><p>&gt;   Well it sure as hell doesn&apos;t say that in the list description.  I don&apos;t think</p><p>&gt; instrument tuning is a bad thing at all...I just don&apos;t believe on monopolizing</p><p>&gt; the subject of tuning to one very specific topic.</p><p>You must be on the wrong list.  This one&apos;s description</p><p>starts &quot;This mailing list is intended for exchanging ideas</p><p>relevant to alternate musical tunings...&quot;</p><p>&gt; ---What about O&apos;Connell&apos;s paper then? I thought it was alarmingly similar to</p><p>&gt; what you&apos;re ---doing but you haven&apos;t acknowledged it.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;     Well, apparently he uses half steps and 3rd steps to make his scales.</p><p>&gt; Though I agree, from what I can tell, the tuning he bases his scales on IE the</p><p>&gt; &quot;circle of PHI&quot; or &quot;PHI mean-tone&quot; (phi^x/2(the standard octave)^y) is the</p><p>&gt; same.   But that&apos;s really just throwing a different generator into the mean-tone</p><p>&gt; equation: I don&apos;t exactly think O&apos;Connell or I did something original just by</p><p>&gt; doing that alone.</p><p>It&apos;s a linear tuning.  It has no more to do with meantone</p><p>than any other linear tuning.  The period&apos;s phi and the</p><p>generator&apos;s 2.  Yes, it&apos;s the same as how yours started, far</p><p>from not even remotely resembling it.</p><p>&gt;    Also, to note, he tempers the generator so the 25th tone of the tuning to</p><p>&gt; match the first (just as 12TET flattens the generating 5th (X) to make it fit</p><p>&gt; the octave on x^12) while I don&apos;t.</p><p>He suggested an equal temperament in 1965.  He then</p><p>suggested different temperaments in the afterword.  Don&apos;t</p><p>confuse matters by describing it all in the present tense.</p><p>&gt; ---What do you mean by &quot;mimic diatonic modes&quot;?</p><p>&gt;    I mean those built try to best approximate intervals like 2nds, 3rds,</p><p>&gt; 5ths...and, on a lower level, to match basic half steps.  For example 10TET is</p><p>&gt; obviously not a diatonic scale since no two notes in it can, say, very well</p><p>&gt; emulate a perfect 2nd.</p><p>So you&apos;re not trying to do that, like the rest of us.</p><p>&gt;   BTW, to be 100% sure what O&apos;Connell&apos;s theories do I&apos;d need a SCALA file</p><p>&gt; example of a scale generated using his method.  Given that it should be</p><p>&gt; blatantly obvious to my ear...if he and I are on the same page or not.  I&apos;m</p><p>&gt; quite willing to do the research given the material.</p><p>Isn&apos;t his 9 note scale essentially the same as your 9 note</p><p>scale?  Anyway, try searching oconnell*scl from the Scala</p><p>archive.  To hear what he intended you need the phi timbre</p><p>as well and that&apos;s more difficult.</p><p>Graham</p></div><h3><a id=82327 href="#82327">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2009 6:15:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--Scratch beneath the surface of the statement &quot;I know what I like&quot; and we get &quot;I don&apos;t like ---what I don&apos;t know&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will at least go so far as to say I DON&apos;T believe the 2/1 octave is the be and all of scale construction.&nbsp; I&apos;ve seen some great work with the tri-tave and slightly stretched octaves that, to my ear, can prove equally expressive.&nbsp; And, recently, I&apos;ve noticed 1.618 (PHI) also makes a great octave and your mind &quot;jumps&quot; a lot when you veer too far above or below it (IE it has a significantly higher level of concordance/consonance with the root than just about any frequency near it).</p><p>&nbsp; I, for one, agree that somewhat blindly accepting the octave should not be a necessity in tuning and I hope others take the leap and at least experiment with using other &quot;octaves&quot; (not 100% sure of the technical term for it) than 2/1.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>--- On Wed, 3/25/09, rick_ballan &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: rick_ballan &lt;rick_ballan@...m.au&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Rational vs Irrational Scales: a response to Rick<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Wednesday, March 25, 2009, 8:11 PM</p><p>            --- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, &quot;Claudio Di Veroli&quot; &lt;dvc@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Who knows?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I speculate that it is because:</p><p>&gt; &gt; ? when a string is &quot;split into two equal parts, each part becomes the</p><p>&gt; &gt; &quot;mirror&quot; of the other.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ?by definition the octave is a doubling of frequency.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I observe that:</p><p>&gt; &gt; ?Lightly touching a string at the octave position produces the same</p><p>&gt; &gt; pitch when playing between the bridge and the finger, and between the</p><p>&gt; &gt; nut and the finger on my guitars, kora, mandolin, basses and other</p><p>&gt; &gt; stringed instruments, and that note has an octave ratio of two to the</p><p>&gt; &gt; open string.</p><p>&gt; &gt; On 23 Mar 2009, at 21:29, Kalle Aho wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Charles,</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; if you think that the best sounding musical intervals might not be</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; at exact integer frequency ratios then why is the octave an</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; exception as it is at 2:1 in LucyTuning?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Kalle Aho</p><p>&gt; &gt; Rick wrote:</p><p>&gt;  &gt; Hi Charles,</p><p>&gt;  &gt;  You mentioned that &quot;Lightly touching a string at the octave position</p><p>&gt; produces the same pitch when playing between the bridge and the finger, and</p><p>&gt; between the nut and the finger on my guitars, kora, etc&quot;.

People here seem to &gt; constantly insist...that definitions 5 and 3 above are equivalent...when it &gt; seems pretty obvious they are not by definition equivalent.  Same goes for &gt; &quot;harmony&quot; vs. &quot;harmonic series&quot;...you can have harmony without it following the &gt; physics-based phenomena that is the harmonic series.</p><p>You&apos;re always talking about what &quot;seems&quot; to be the case. That tells us a lot about your distorted view of reality, but how about sticking to the facts?  Do you have a citation for somebody insisting on this definition?</p><p>This list is about music, so naturally we&apos;ll follow the &quot;Music&quot; definition.  I&apos;m not even happy about the &quot;Physics&quot; definition in terms of physics.  I notice, from that same page, that it isn&apos;t in Webster&apos;s or American Heritage.  I don&apos;t have a technical dictionary to cross-reference with.</p><p>If you want to know what &quot;we&quot; agree on you could at least start with the Monzopedia:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/c/consonance.aspx">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/c/consonance.aspx</a></p><p>&gt;     Indeed, in the end of the day, I agree with Cameron that ears are the only &gt; way to know for sure if something works or if something is/is-not possible. &gt; Mathematics, IMVHO, can only help us fine-tune the general areas our ears point &gt; to...and I strongly believe the best tuning wizards are the ones who don&apos;t rely &gt; mostly on math, but always &quot;reverse solve/prove&quot; what they find with math &gt; through their ears before accepting it as good.</p><p>Of course, we&apos;d all broadly agree with that.  It&apos;s hardly controversial, is it?  The best tuning wizards are the ones that exist.  What a surprise!</p><p>I can still think of some reasons for not trusting your ears.  Everybody hears things differently and you may be optimizing for your own, unique perception.  (Scale stretches seem to be like this -- by which I mean there&apos;s evidence that different listeners have a different sense of &quot;correct&quot; octaves.  Try Terhardt.)  Your hearing might actually be faulty.  Remember we all lose high frequencies as we get older.  Your equipment might be faulty.  This is particularly important with sine waves and beats because distortion can make you hear things that shouldn&apos;t be there.   Most importantly, you&apos;re naturally going to become familiar with the tunings you work with and so you&apos;ll hear them as less strange than a naive listener will.</p><p>All these caveats matter if you want other people to listen to your music.  There&apos;s always somebody who&apos;ll come along and say they don&apos;t, in which case it doesn&apos;t really matter what it sounds like.

With enough notes it can suit any other scale you like.</p><p>&gt;   The flip side is, based on your last somewhat charged response to me, even if &gt; he was &quot;in his world&quot;...is your view on JI superiority really any less &gt; &quot;uselessly proud&quot; (I kind of doubt it)?! :-(</p><p>Well, I hope not, of course.</p><p>&gt;    Once again my point is...come on guys, can&apos;t we move past analyzing and &gt; making scales that either<br/>&gt; A) Imitate JI and/or diatonic intervals in general (yes, this includes 12TET, &gt; meantone, or subsets of 19TET, 31TET, 53TET...meant to match diatonic intervals).<br/>&gt;   OR<br/>&gt; B) Don&apos;t even try for harmony or are used for purposes of &quot;experimenting with &gt; dissonance&quot;.</p><p>Imitating JI is the obvious way of getting harmony to work.   It&apos;s where you&apos;ve ended up.  Do you have any other ideas?   Depending on how define JI, it can be very difficult to avoid, what with the density of the rationals.</p><p>&gt; Again, as counter-examples I would say Wilson (for example his 9-tone MOS &gt; scales) and Sethares.  And again, in my mind so far as I&apos;ve seen, these two &gt; people constitute most (if not all) of truly modern tuning (IE that which sounds &gt; both consonant in terms of polyphonic use and quite different from anything from &gt; the past).  If you want to know why, look back at A) and B) above and notice &gt; those two people&apos;s work appears to defy both.</p><p>So what 9-tone MOS scales are you talking about?  You keep mentioning them but no details.  Erv Wilson has done a lot of work with just intonation.  I&apos;d put him squarely in A).</p><p>Bill Sethares has, as we know, done work with alternative timbres.  That may or may not count as JI depending on your definition.  It&apos;s worth pointing out that he wasn&apos;t the first to do this as he sometimes gets more credit than he deserves -- which is still considerable.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=82376 href="#82376">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2009 6:30:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>djtrancendance@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; --12TET isn&apos;t a very (let alone VERY) close approximation to<br/>&gt; --the harmonic series.

As an odd limit, the nearest neighbor is 6/5.  About 115 cents away.  As a prime limit, the nearest neighbor of anything is 0 cents away so that isn&apos;t very interesting.</p><p>As a sensible extension of the odd limit, you&apos;ll get a 9/8, which is pretty close.  But this is extended 3-limit, which 12TET generally does better than the 5-limit.  It is still very efficient at approximating the 5-limit but not so close as that in absolute terms.  You&apos;re likely to use a 25:24 in extended 5-limit JI.  That&apos;s about 30 cents out in 12TET, or 30% of a scale step.  If that&apos;s very close there can&apos;t be anything (with enough notes, at least) that&apos;s very far away.</p><p>&gt; --I&apos;m not interested in your delusions.<br/>&gt;     The only things I referred to were that people like Sethares did things far &gt; from JI and managed to sound consonant.  And I&apos;m not the only one who also &gt; thinks that...so, no, it&apos;s not a delusion: you can have a consonant scale that &gt; is not diatonic.</p><p>No, that isn&apos;t all.  You also said &quot;... I don&apos;t seem to qualify to you as making &apos;alternative tunings&apos;...it appears you ... have a preconceived notion that scales MUST meet the definition of harmonic series periodicity ... to be relevant.&quot;  This is delusional and I have no more to say about it.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  &gt; the PHI^x/2^y construct I use in my own tuning. So, I&apos;m pretty sure our tunings<br/>&gt;  &gt; are alike, if not the same.<br/>&gt; ---You use the same timbre? You didn&apos;t mention the timbre before.<br/>&gt;    I don&apos;t use that to generate the timbre...I use it to generate the tuning &gt; itself. You snipped the relevant part, which was &quot;I think that&apos;s the one thing we may have in common is that timbre.&quot;  What did you mean by it?  What timbre are you using?</p><p>&gt; &gt; ---Yes, they look the same, give or take some temperament.<br/>&gt;   The tunings do, I believe that much.  But my scales are different...his 9-tone &gt; scale is much wider (IE takes up much more vast of a frequency range for 9 notes).</p><p>His is about 3 cents wider.  So it&apos;s the tunings that are slightly different.</p><p>&gt;  &gt; BTW, as we&apos;ve discussed, I am taking a good few of your suggestions<br/>&gt;  &gt; seriously and have been working with the idea of making a tempered scale that<br/>&gt;  &gt; complies relatively well with BOTH JI and PHI and could be used easily on<br/>&gt;  &gt; acoustic instruments. So stay tuned for that... :-)<br/>&gt; --That&apos;s good, but there are lots of precedents out there for<br/>&gt; --JI scales.<br/>&gt;    Precedents such as? There&apos;s the one I found in Huainanzi.  Or the various ones Ptolemy listed.  Or Al Farabi&apos;s.  Plenty of more recent examples as well.</p><p>&gt;    My point in such a scale is that irrational generators can form patterns that &gt; have CLOSE ties with harmonic-series-type intervals many of which are NOT near &gt; diatonic intervals...and yet still sound very consonant.  Again, here&apos;s the my &gt; PHI scale converted to very nearby JI ratios (again, just a few cents away at &gt; most from tones in the PHI tuning):<br/>&gt; 1<br/>&gt; 17/16<br/>&gt; 9/8<br/>&gt; 19/16<br/>&gt; 5/4<br/>&gt; 4/3<br/>&gt; 7/5<br/>&gt; 28/19<br/>&gt; 14/9<br/>&gt; 21/13  (1.6153846) apx 1.618033<br/>&gt; &gt;     I dare you to find a duplicate of that scale: without PHI leading me past &gt; the basic interval areas above I likely would have never found this pattern. :-)</p><p>How do you get 4/3?  The simplest match I can find within 5 cents is -10 2:1 generators.  And 5/4???  That could be -33 generators.  What, in fact, is this &quot;PHI tuning&quot;?</p><p>I note that 4 of your first 5 notes are within 5 cents of 12TET.  The exception is 5/4.  So if 12TET is very close to 5-limit JI, this scale starts even closer.  The last three are further away, of course.  All steps but the last are within 16 cents of 12TET.  Only one other is more than 12 cents out.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=82377 href="#82377">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2009 7:00:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>djtrancendance@... wrote:<br/>&gt;    As a foreword, now I realize you are not arguing for or against the &quot;physics&quot; &gt; definition of consonance...</p><p>I am arguing against it.

I&apos;ll stick to that JI is about &gt; music, but it IS NOT the definition of music...meaning something not made in JI &gt; can still just as competently qualify as music.</p><p>Well, of course JI isn&apos;t the definition of music.

Again...it seems obvious there is no one tuning which has &gt; a &quot;monopoly&quot;...thus leaving room for the idea that tunings that don&apos;t follow &gt; that one model (IE irrationally generated tunings) may also work either as well &gt; or nearly as well (and perhaps provide some new artistic/emotional freedom on &gt; the side). :-)</p><p>My point, which may not have been clear, is that there are so many different styles that are called &quot;jazz&quot; that it&apos;s almost impossible for the same person to dislike them all. But still you hear people with apparently normal hearing say &quot;I don&apos;t like jazz&quot;.  There are also so many ways of making music with 5-limit JI, depending on the definition, that everybody must like at least one of them.  But you insist that you know people who don&apos;t.

Though, at least I noticed, many of the &gt; other notes are 8+ cents off, thus often pushing them into being interpreted as &gt; different tones so far as the brain is concerned (huygens tritone, 17th &gt; harmonic, 19th harmonic, septimal minor 6th, and then there&apos;s that odd 28/19 &gt; ratio and 21/13 (IE those mysterious &quot;last few ratios&quot;) you mentioned).<br/>&gt; &gt; --The last three are further away, of course. All steps but the last are<br/>&gt; --within 16 cents of 12TET. Only one other is more than 12<br/>&gt; --cents out.<br/>&gt;    Interesting...it seems you&apos;re right they are more commonalities than I &gt; realize, at least within the first &quot;pseudo octave&quot; of the PHI scale.</p><p>If you&apos;re comparing to 12-equal, and checking with people who are used to 12-equal, it&apos;s hardly surprising you end up with the best fit to 12-equal that&apos;s possible within your constraints.</p><p>&gt;   Although, just for grins...try extending my scale into more octaves IE past &gt; 1.618 and up to 1.618 and THEN compare it to 12TET going up to about 1.618^2.  &gt; It may be that the scale simply skews itself relative to 12TET as it moves to &gt; higher harmonics...remember we are using apx. 1.618 as the octave and not &gt; 2/1...I think it&apos;s pretty safe to assume that will cause an increasingly &gt; significant difference in how the ratios play out at higher octaves.</p><p>The steps sizes will be the same whatever register you look at.  Melodies will sound like 12TET, with a few steps wrong.   Only two steps are outside the tolerance range for the rationals matching phi ratios, or the 12TET diatonic being &quot;very close&quot; to 5-limit JI.  This is as close as you can get to 12TET and keep the equivalence interval near to phi.</p><p>                           Graham</p></div><h3><a id=82402 href="#82402">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2009 10:25:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>djtrancendance@... wrote:<br/>&gt;     Hehe...well it was partly a joke.  :-)  The idea is making scales that are &gt; almost indistinguishably close to being &quot;perfectly diatonic&quot; so far as the &gt; intervals they use may add extra consonance but, in the greater scheme of &gt; things, really function like part of something very very old.

I wish the</p><p>&gt; page hadn&apos;t been taken down but I recall the ones I mentioned (particularly the</p><p>&gt; 6-tone ones) had been mentioned by Carl Lumma as MOS.  Furthermore, Marcus</p><p>&gt; Satellite (one of my favorite micro-tonal artists) confirmed to me the Wilson</p><p>&gt; scales he used were MOS.  Carl...can you back me up on this?</p><p>Golden horagrams give you an MOS and a Mt Meru scale that</p><p>tends towards it.  I believe Marcus Satellite used MOS</p><p>scales but what does that have to do with the scales you&apos;re</p><p>talking about?  Anyway, try reading The Scales of Mt. Meru here:</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphori">http://www.anaphori</a> <a href="http://a.com/wilson">a.com/wilson</a>. html</p><p>&gt;    But, yes, you&apos;re right...in the sense that they use whole number ratios they</p><p>&gt; are JI.  But the way they are generated, as I understand, is far from the way JI</p><p>&gt; is generated.  Kind of like the way my scale approaches on many JI ratios</p><p>&gt; (despite only using PHI^(1 to 15) and not the infinite set of PHI^(0-infinity) ),</p><p>&gt; but is not JI generated.</p><p>If they&apos;re JI, they must be generated the way JI is generated.</p><p>&gt; --You could also try reading the book Bill</p><p>&gt; --Sethares wrote about tunings, timbres, spectrums, and</p><p>&gt; --scales, whatever that was called.

You know, even out of JI or mean-tone &gt;fanatics... you&apos;d think a lot of such people would at least question &gt;the possibility using 3/2 as the octave...after all, diatonic theory &gt;revolves around the circle of fifths, does it not?&quot;. Why use the term &quot;fanatics&quot; which is also a loaded term designed to undermine actual musical harmony? And creating mod 7 has already been explored many times in serial music, which is tantamount to treating the fifth like the octave. As Shoernberg said, &quot;To those of you who &quot;won&apos;t go too far&quot; but cannot explain why you go &quot;so far&quot;.&quot; Why not call the semitone the octave, or the flat fifth, or the square root of phi divided by the log of 433, and so on to infinity? After all, not to do so would be just another form of &quot;western bias&quot;.</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=82509 href="#82509">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/31/2009 10:07:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, djtrancendance@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --What is all this about calling the fifth or phi the octave &quot;from another point of view&quot;?<br/>&gt; Because it functions in the same way...&gt;&gt;regardless&lt;&lt; of the name.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Even my nine year old niece, being naturally musically talented, will<br/>&gt; automatically sing --melodies an octave above what she hears on the<br/>&gt; radio, and she has no &quot;hidden agenda&quot;.<br/>&gt;    That&apos;s AKA just plain old &quot;adapting to Western culture/music&quot;.

Thus, your problem is not<br/>solved, it is shown to be nonsensical.</p><p>&gt; Are they below the schizma threshold?</p><p>What is that?</p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3><a id=82603 href="#82603">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2009 11:19:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Hans,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not certain if you&apos;re answering me (Rick) or Michael,</p><p>I looked at the posting I answered to and have to say I myself cabbot tell for sure...</p><p>&gt; but if it was me, then yes, I was talking about something related<br/>&gt; but slightly different.</p><p>Alright then - sorry for breaking in in any case.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, the tempered 3rd is 2^1/3 = 1.25992105...The &quot;...&quot;<br/>&gt; here means that, theoretically speaking, there are an infinite<br/>&gt; amount of digits after the decimal point, which as you said &quot;no<br/>&gt; human will ever hear the difference&quot;.
