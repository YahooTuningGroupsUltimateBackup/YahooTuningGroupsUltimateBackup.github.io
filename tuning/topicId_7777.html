Checking...</p><p>My algorithm doesn&apos;t bother because I&apos;m only interested in absolute<br/>consistency and don&apos;t need to took at the individual triads.  It works<br/>because given a triad (A,B,C) and some random other pitch X, if (A,B,C)<br/>is inconsistent then at least one of (A,B,X), (A,X,C), and (X,B,C) will<br/>be inconsistent as well.  But for your purposes, Carl, Paul E. is right;<br/>you should check _all_ the triads.</p><p>--pH &lt;<a href="mailto:manynote@library.wustl.edu">manynote@library.wustl.edu</a>&gt; <a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote</a><br/>    O<br/>   /\        &quot;Churchill?

Of course that&apos;s right.  Fortunately, way I&apos;ve done things, it only<br/>takes about 10 seconds to fix.  The consist_triad files at<br/>ftp://lumma.org/pub/ are corrected.</p><p>I hesitated because I was still turning up the right stop limits -- you&apos;d<br/>think there&apos;d be places where a triad without a 1 would cause consistency<br/>to fail, and I&apos;d have missed it.</p><p>I forgot that to save time, I had the program checking for overall<br/>consistency in the normal way, before calculating subsets.</p><p>Funny thing is, taking that failsafe out and still checking only for triads<br/>with 1&apos;s, I can&apos;t find such a spot.  If you&apos;d like to try it, the procedure<br/>is called only_1s (also at my ftp site).</p><p>A corrected version of the chart I posted yesterday appears at:<br/><a href="http://lumma.org/consist_fail.txt">http://lumma.org/consist_fail.txt</a></p><p>I admit it&apos;s getting a little crowded.</p><p>Thanks!<br/>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul H.
