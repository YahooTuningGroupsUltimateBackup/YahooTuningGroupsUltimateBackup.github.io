There&apos;s just<br/>something about this medium that brings out the worst in people when<br/>it comes to disagreements and the like--especially argumentative,<br/>stubborn, hotheaded people (and I should know, &apos;cause I&apos;ve been there<br/>too many times myself only to later wish I hadn&apos;t).</p><p>Some people are good models in this regard... Margo obviously, but<br/>also Joe Monzo... I never, *ever* once remember Joe loosing his cool<br/>no matter how heated or personally insulting things got. I try to<br/>think of Joe when I know I shouldn&apos;t fire off a petulant response...<br/>it&apos;s hard, but not that hard.</p><p>Thanks Joe--and everyone else I&apos;m not mentioning who musters some<br/>restraint in this regard--for setting a good example.

I used to be 1/2 of the infamous Brahms Gang, and I like to think I&apos;ve reformed, but there&apos;s a lot to reform there, so verbum sat sapienti. Of course if you are sufficiently sapient there might be no tinder for my temper.</p></div>
