Piano<br/>manufacturing in the US long ago ceased to reach the production levels needed<br/>to offset the labour costs, and the kind of iron casting used in piano frames<br/>represents both an archaic material and a form of manufacture that largely<br/>ceased to innovate in the 19th century.</p><p>A recent history of Steinway gives an indication of just how small the<br/>production line has been.  Even Far East manufacturers are able to maintain<br/>piano manufacturing now only as loss centers within diversified firms or with<br/>extensive subcontracting to low-labour countries.  An alternative design for<br/>a piano frame is not likely ever to be made in a production large enough to<br/>compensate for the development costs which are the same whether one produce<br/>one or many frames.</p></div>
