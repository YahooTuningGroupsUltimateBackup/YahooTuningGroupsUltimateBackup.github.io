Here, it would be audacious to<br/>consider the D as a 7, because of its proximity with the real tonic D of<br/>this motet. Perhaps, the notion of transition may be explained by this<br/>impossibility to justify a 7, but we must proove this with different<br/>scores. There is the same problem on 40th and 41th bar, also with a D.</p><p>### Chromatisms</p><p>&#x9;In 4th bar, there is a chromatism which can be logically analised, if<br/>the G is identified as a 7 : A-G#-G = 16-15-14. Trying to combine usual<br/>semi-tones would be very complex (but not impossible, only incoherent).<br/>The 39th bar is a lot more complex, if we want that the D of soprano<br/>part to be at 9/8 under the E of 40th bar, while keeping usual semi-tone<br/>16/15 between D# and E, the semi-tone D-D# becomes complex : 135/128.<br/>Apparently, a simpler solution consist in considering that D-D#-E is<br/>equivalent to 16-17-18, this hypothesis will be developped in the<br/>chapter on the chromatism.</p><p>### Modulations</p><p>The problem of the correct ratio between the new and the old tonic is<br/>rarely mentionned in theoretical works. At best, advocates (and<br/>detractors) of just intonation scales consider that the new tonic is<br/>necessarily a note of the main scale. This non-avowed postulat is really<br/>not justifable, and it seems obvious that the way of the modulation<br/>intervenes directly in the pitch of the new tonic. This point will be<br/>also developped in a chapter of my future &quot;Th&iuml;&iquest;&half;se de Doctorat&quot; (~~<br/>Dissertation). A foreseeable risk is that the return to the initial key<br/>happens one or more commas higher or lower [&quot;pump&quot;?]. In that case, we<br/>will have to prove that there is no mistake in the analyse, or if we may<br/>consider that the composer hasn&apos;t modulate with the good way, or if it<br/>is deliberately comlex. Also, we may decide that it prove the necessity<br/>of Equal Temperament; but, at least, we must know how the modulation<br/>will be perceived [and performed].<br/>&#x9;In our score, there is a problem like that between 36th and 41th bars.<br/>After a surprising V-IV cadence there is a series of chords with a lot<br/>of chromatisms, &quot;landing&quot;, on the last quarter-note of 41th bar on the<br/>same fourth degree arranging as the same way, it looks like a hole in<br/>the score, where there is a short but daring coda. Here are the<br/>different chords of this passage :</p><p>36th bar : A major<br/>37th bar : G major<br/>38th bar : D dominant seventh chord<br/>39th bar : G minor, then a diminished seventh chord in E minor (without<br/>the root B)<br/>40th bar : E major turning into a (false?) seventh dominant chord.<br/>41th bar : a seventh dominant chord in D major, then the first degree of<br/>D major (as a sixth), then the return of the IVth degree of D (G major).</p><p>&#x9;A first attempt of numbering analyse gives this calculation :</p><p>bar  !   36      !   37     !   38     !   39     !   39     !  40<br/>! 41  !<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>chord! A x 8/9 = ! G x 3/4 =! D x 4/3 =! G x 5/4 =! B x 3/2 =! E x 3/2 =<br/>! A   !</p><p>(the B is the estimated root of the diminished seventh chord of 39th<br/>bar).<br/>The fractions are those which are deducted &quot;logically&quot; from the melody<br/>formed by the root of each chord. With this logic, we found that the<br/>chord of A (dominant seventh) of 41th bar is one comma syntonic (81/80)<br/>lower than the one of 36th bar. As we have already consider, either it&apos;s<br/>voluntary, or it&apos;s a mistake of Mozart, or an error of the analyst. The<br/>critical place, where an other solution is possible is the progression<br/>of 39th bar, may be it must be considered most melodically than<br/>harmonically? The previous solution gives for the chromatism of the<br/>sopranos (39th and 40th bar) : D-D# = 24-25, and D#-E = 15-16, hence D-E<br/>= 9-10. We can &quot;decide&quot; that D-E is equal to 8-9, what permits precisely<br/>to recuperate the 81/80 comma which exist between minor whole tone<br/>(10/9) and major whole tone (9/8). In this case we must fix the pitch of<br/>the intermediate D#, we have already consider 16-17-18 for this<br/>chromatism D-D#-E, this choice imply, as we have supposed it, a most<br/>melodic than harmonic reading of this progression. This approach is, for<br/>the moment, a simple hypothesis, but this problem of the modulations<br/>mustn&apos;t be neglected since we make up our&apos;s mind to analyse a score with<br/>the &quot;simple&quot; fractions [&quot;Just intonation&quot; in U.S.].<br/>&#x9;An other very complex progression - which we won&apos;t study here - is at<br/>14th bar. It&apos;s an interrupted cadence with a diminished seventh chord<br/>coming between the Vth and the VIth degree.</p><p>### Speculations and intonation</p><p>&#x9;The previous analysis are rather daunting, I hope that other analysis<br/>as the same principle will contribute to return them more convivial.<br/>Nevertheless, those analysis will be able, more or less punctually, help<br/>to detect, even to correct, some problems of intonation, of pitch, for<br/>strings or voices. The 22th and 23th bar provide us a typical example of<br/>this approach. We can see a quite daring progression from an A major<br/>chord towards a dominant chord in F major. If we consider the A as a<br/>really &quot;equal note&quot; (without any comma) between A and F major, and if,<br/>as well, we allow that Ist, IId and IId degree in major scale are equal<br/>to 8-9-10, then bass must sing a whole tone 10/9 between A and G of 23th<br/>bar. When voices work separately, it may happen that, because of the key<br/>of 20th to 22th bars (A major), the G may be sing too low, as a 7th in D<br/>major, which is 8/7 (if we allow, I have already say, the hypothesis of<br/>the &quot;7th harmonic&quot;).<br/>&#x9;After I done this hypothesis, I asked a chorus master if he has any<br/>problems of pitch in this score. He answered that there are a lot of<br/>problems, and precisely on 23th bar where &quot;bass are too low&quot;.</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>End of analysis of Ave Verum (part II/II)<br/>Xavier CHARLES</p></div>
