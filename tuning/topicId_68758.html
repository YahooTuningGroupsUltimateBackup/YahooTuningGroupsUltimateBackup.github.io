Wondering if anyone out there<br/>may be able to assist with ideas, possible formulas<br/>for computing, deriving values and feedback;</p><p>A range of 22 values exist.  Conceptually the values<br/>comprise a sort of harmonic series, or possibly an<br/>irregular scale or octave.</p><p>We only know two values in the range of 22.</p><p>From these two values we want to derive the other<br/>possible remaining twenty values;</p><p>1.842030768<br/>3.2</p><p>We also want to determine what the relationship is<br/>between the two values interval wise;</p><p>For instance, if we say 1.842030768 is the 1/1 of the<br/>scale, what interval would we associate 3.2 with?</p><p>Or alternatively from a different perspective, if we<br/>have only these two values, and we know they belong to<br/>a scale of twenty two irregular notes but we do not<br/>know the values of the other notes or intervals how do<br/>we compute them based on these values, would we say<br/>that 1.842030768 is closest to a minor 7th and 3.2<br/>a minor 6th an octave up?</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?
