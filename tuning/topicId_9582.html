Epiphone guitars, at least while I was in college, I<br/>found<br/>&gt; to be dreadfully out-of-tune with themselves, for example.  Luthiers&apos;<br/>&gt; Merchantile sells fretting charts so that makers don&apos;t have to do any<br/>&gt; calculations.  Some of them don&apos;t know what the calculations are.  A few<br/>even<br/>&gt; still stick with &quot;the rule of the 18th,&quot; which basically estimates the<br/>twelfth<br/>&gt; root of 2 to be 18/17.  That&apos;s a pretty good estimate for a half step<br/>alone, but<br/>&gt; the error really adds up quickly when you apply it repeatedly.</p><p>As a newbie here I thought I&apos;d lurk for a while, but I might add something<br/>here. I have a friend who is a guitar maker and some time ago he did some<br/>tweaks on a guitar of mine.</p><p>There are a couple of ways to retune the frets of guitar--in fact the whole<br/>issue of building a guitar to be in tune is a deep subject. But as far as<br/>the frets are concerned there is a device called a fret file which is<br/>designed to remove metal from the frets and still preserve the &quot;roundness&quot;<br/>of the fret. Between the file and special wide fret wire, you can move the<br/>placement a small amount and tune that location to the proper position.</p><p>This is a VERY tedious process and unless you&apos;re willing to pay a lot of<br/>money, or learn to do it your self, not something the average player would<br/>want to get involved with.</p><p>The discussion of this is probably beyond the topic of this list, except to<br/>say that most custom guitar makers would be happy to add frets to a guitar,<br/>if you&apos;ve got enough cash. You might have to be willing to work with the<br/>builder over an extended period of time to get it right.</p><p>Paul</p></div><h3><a id=9585 href="#9585">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

That causes higher frets to have higher tension than<br/>the<br/>&gt;lower frets, and pushing the bridge back makes compensates for that by<br/>giving<br/>&gt;those higher frets a greater percentage lengthening than the lower ones.</p><p>This bridge correction will go a long way in correcting the errors<br/>compounded from using the &quot;rule of the 18th&quot;, making the latter quite useful<br/>in practice.</p></div>
