Quite frankly, though, I believe that you discuss<br/>fundamentals to a great enough extent that even a layman, or a non-<br/>microtonal musician (there *are* a few of those... :)  without the<br/>background could understand it.  That&apos;s crucial, of course, since one<br/>can&apos;t expect that all of the readers have been following the Tuning<br/>List... :)</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll have some more specific questions as I study it further, but<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; think it marks a new level in clarity of Erlich writing to date...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks.
