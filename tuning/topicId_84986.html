Not my cup-o-tea. The Ives was pretty<br/>cool, though---not my favorite composer overall (sorry, I know that the<br/>height of coolness and hipness to many many composers is to worship at the<br/>Ives alter) but certainly contains some juicy stuff, and I think, very<br/>neo-Romantic in gesture more than modernists like to think...I hear much in<br/>common with late Scriabin and a lot of Ives piano music. Although the Ives<br/>has a little bit more of that quintessential American flavor and devilish<br/>humor. Like in the 2nd movement, at around 1&apos;50&quot;--those American marching<br/>band type moments that are so Ives.</p><p>The picture put up to go with the Wyschnegradsky music says it all--a stark<br/>B&amp;W woodcut of a man clearly pushed to psychic limits of sanity. Very, very,<br/>post 2nd Viennese school, and not at all what interests me or turns me on as<br/>a composer OR listener....although I respect the likes of Schoenberg, and<br/>much of the music inspired in their wake, I never find myself rushing to buy<br/>or swim in their sounds. Not a fan of Babbitt or Boulez. Or Carter. I have<br/>enough neurosis and anxiety in my own inner life, thank you very much---I<br/>like much that can settle me, calm me, or give me a catharsis in a much<br/>tamer way. Plus, it&apos;s 2009, not 1961. I know, I know, to each his own!</p><p>It could also be the _gestures_ of these composers that I react to even more<br/>than the tunings or even sonorities---I have ZERO problem with the gentle,<br/>Zen-like beauty of Morton Feldman, which actually soothes me for hours.<br/>Maybe I like my ultra-dissonance pianissimo? In any event, for me, if I feel<br/>like I&apos;m getting paper cuts in my ears listening any more, I turn it off and<br/>look elsewhere.</p><p>Let me say this, though---Ives as a rhythmic innovator is unparalled,<br/>however, and I do enjoy the amazing, and amazingly *humorous* piano studies.<br/>With Schoenberg, I tend to like the neo-tonal stuff best, both early and<br/>late periods---e.g. Verklarte Nacht, and say the 2nd chamber symphony. And<br/>if I&apos;m in the right mood, the 5 orchestral pieces hit the spot.</p><p>AKJ</p><p>On Tue, Oct 13, 2009 at 7:55 AM, daniel_anthony_stearns &lt;<br/>daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; quarter-tones have taken a lot of slag over the years, but I never really<br/>&gt; bought it, and man....

Examine the formulas in the cells to see how frequencies, beat rates, and brats are calculated.</p><p>In the two temperaments I gave you, all 24 major &amp; minor triads have exact proportional beating.
