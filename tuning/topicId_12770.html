After reading a bit John Adams wrote about<br/>Lou Harrison&apos;s &quot;free style&quot; JI, it suddenly dawned on me that this<br/>also seems to me to be a simple way to go about achieving something<br/>directly analogous to the Harrison example with an unbounded rhythmic<br/>space sitting in for an unbounded tonal space.</p><p>To convert ratios into &quot;note durations,&quot; I used<br/>[(LOG(n)-LOG(d))*(P/LOG(2))] where &quot;n&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are simply the top and<br/>bottom terms of a given ratio (the numerator and the denominator), and<br/>&quot;P&quot; is whatever you want to define a given periodicity (while this<br/>means any rhythmic periodicity, by way of the Harrison free style<br/>analogy, this could be seen as making the octave equal the &quot;barline&quot;<br/>so to speak). I almost always tried these out in conjunction with<br/>other, more traditional rhythmic designs, and was generally content to<br/>let P = meter. I remember finding these two rhythmic worlds all but<br/>prohibitively difficult to reconcile; the convinces and shortcomings<br/>of notation and &quot;counting&quot; did not help! (however, my drum machine<br/>didn&apos;t so much as once complain, and nailed &apos;em with ease the first<br/>time through...)</p><p>In the Harrison example, if I&apos;m understanding it correctly, a complex<br/>global surface of pitches are arrived at by the stepwise accumulation<br/>of simpler JI intervals, here you no longer have the simple grid-like<br/>duration&apos;s of halves, quarters, eighths, and the like, but rather a<br/>collision of logarithmic and linear designs, where 5:7s, 7:10s,<br/>12:17s, etc. are &quot;halves,&quot; and 5:6s, 6:7s, 11:13s, etc, &quot;quarters,&quot;<br/>and so forth.</p><p>ds</p></div><h3>Jacky Ligon &#x3C;jacky_ekstasis@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2000 6:09:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan,</p><p>Hi.</p><p>Do you happen to have musical examples of this (on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>)? Please<br/>do point me toward them if so. This is very interesting to me. This<br/>is somewhat analogous to something I&apos;ve tried with poly-tempi - which<br/>generally involves layers of simultaneous ratio based tempos, by<br/>which all of the performance elements are coordinated by a series of<br/>rhythmic reference tracks (click tracks at different tempos - except<br/>with more developed percussion parts). This is not to mention the<br/>fact that much of this music also delved deep into poly-meters (an<br/>area of current exploration). Ratios as applied to pitch, tempo,<br/>meter and - in your case - durations, can be very beautiful.</p><p>Peace,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Something that I&apos;ve experimented with a bit in the past is<br/>converting<br/>&gt; &quot;ratios&quot; into durations.</p></div><h3>Darren Burgess &#x3C;DBURGESS@ACCELERATION.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2000 6:34:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Check out these audio files of the polyrhythmophone:<br/><a href="http://www.city-net.com/~moko/rvirtual.html">http://www.city-net.com/~moko/rvirtual.html</a></p><p>Darren</p></div><h3>Rosati &#x3C;dante@pop.interport.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2000 10:11:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: Darren Burgess &lt;<a href="mailto:DBURGESS@ACCELERATION.NET">DBURGESS@ACCELERATION.NET</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Check out these audio files of the polyrhythmophone:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.city-net.com/~moko/rvirtual.html">http://www.city-net.com/~moko/rvirtual.html</a></p><p>Cool!
