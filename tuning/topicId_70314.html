His drinking, drug-taking and<br/>sexual exploits were renowned, even for Hollywood, but the phrase is<br/>said to have been coined following his acquittal in February 1943 for<br/>the statutory rape of a teenage girl. This seems to be supported by<br/>the date of the first example recorded, in American Speech in December<br/>1946, which cited a 1945 use in the sense of something being done easily.</p><p>The trouble with this explanation is that examples of obviously<br/>related expressions have now turned up from dates before Flynn&apos;s<br/>trial. Barry Popik of the American Dialect Society found an example<br/>from 1940, as well as this from the sports section of the San<br/>Francisco Examiner of 8 February 1942: &quot;Answer these questions<br/>correctly and your name is Flynn, meaning you&apos;re in, provided you have<br/>two left feet and the written consent of your parents&quot;. To judge from<br/>a newspaper reference he turned up from early 1943, the phrase could<br/>by then also be shortened to I&apos;m Flynn, meaning &quot;I&apos;m in&quot;.</p><p>It&apos;s suggested by some writers that the phrase really originated with<br/>another Flynn, Edward J Flynn Â— &quot;Boss&quot; Flynn Â— a campaign manager for<br/>the Democratic party during FDR&apos;s presidency. Flynn&apos;s machine in the<br/>South Bronx in New York was so successful at winning elections that<br/>his candidates seemed to get into office automatically.</p><p>The existence of the examples found by Mr Popik certainly suggest the<br/>expression was at first unconnected with Errol Flynn, but that it<br/>shifted its association when he became such a notorious figure. Since<br/>then, it has altered again, because in 1967 a film, In Like Flint, a<br/>spy spoof starring James Coburn, took its title by wordplay from the<br/>older expression, and in turn caused many people to think that the<br/>phrase was really in like Flint.</p><p>(aaron again) there&apos;s also this tidbit:<br/><a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_156.html">http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_156.html</a></p><p>&gt; And I&apos;m with you, man: microtonal.
