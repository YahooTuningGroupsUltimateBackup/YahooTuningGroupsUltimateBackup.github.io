How the<br/>intervals tune in the context of a chord depends upon what role the tones<br/>play in the chord. For an example that would include all three of the major<br/>seconds you mention, consider a dominant seventh chord with a natural<br/>ninth. Tuned 4:5:6:7:9, we have 9/8 between the ninth and the root, 10/9<br/>between the third and the ninth, and 8/7 between the root and the seventh<br/>(making octave adjustments as necessary). With regard to the tritone,<br/>whether it is 7/5 or 10/7 depends upon which note is the third and which is<br/>the seventh. Of course I&apos;m assuming that the interval between the root and<br/>third is 5/4 and not the high thrid that has been discussed here recently.</p><p>John Link</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by the JOHN LINK VOCAL QUINTET,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Brahe and Taylor, Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill<br/>Evans, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl<br/>Zindars.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Check out <a href="http://WWW.DUESBERG.COM">WWW.DUESBERG.COM</a> for information that could make the difference<br/>between life and death for you or someone you know.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p></div><h3><a id=7713 href="#7713">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Likely not &quot;naturally&quot; (perceptually). I&apos;m more<br/>&gt; concerned about what causes, or contributes to, the &quot;high third&quot; experience<br/>&gt; as I have described it here many times--which I suspect has little or<br/>&gt; nothing to do with major seconds, neither intellectually nor naturally.<br/>&gt;</p><p>As part of this thread, people responded on how 9/8 45/32 27/16 could be<br/>perceived more readilly than 9/8 11/8 13/8, since it tunes the triad.<br/>Although the numbers look daunting, 27/16 is &quot;the fifth of the fifth<br/>of the fifth&quot;, which is sort of straightforward and the 45/32 fills<br/>in the major triad between it and the &quot;fifth of the fifth&quot;.</p><p>Depending on ones belief in the strength of fifths (that &quot;up a fifth<br/>4 times&quot; after octave adjustment is a hearable relationship) and on<br/>the strength of the overtone series (that the 81&apos;st overtone still has<br/>a reasonably good pocket to slip into), then this could seem like a<br/>good choice for the high third.</p><p>Speaking of which, what happens to the high third in seventh chords, either<br/>dominant or major?

Now it<br/>&gt; &gt; is true that the Pythagorean major third wouldn&apos;t lock harmonically as part<br/>&gt; &gt; of a triad, so for the third time I suggest the possibility of<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/24:1/19:1/16 for your locked major triad with high third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For now the second time in a post to you (and the third if you count another<br/>&gt; to someone else) I am requesting a clarification of what appear to be<br/>&gt; fractions separated by colons.</p><p>Paul will have a better explanation of where this notation comes from<br/>but when I see it, I just multiply by the first denominator.

Here&apos;s why. As one tunes &quot;partials&quot; over a fundamental,<br/>the higher the numbers the less vividly intervals lock perceptually. While<br/>the 2:3 fifth can readily be locked in by raw beginners, locking in the 8:11<br/>interval, for example, takes considerable experience but can be mastered.</p><p>Also, while a single sounding fifth is easy to perceive, it seems to me that<br/>imagining(?) a number of stacked fifths is unlikely. While scale step 2 can<br/>be conceived as a stack of two fifths, it seems more practical to &quot;hear&quot; it<br/>as 8:9. Even though the numbers jibe (2:3 + 2:3 = 4:9 or 8:9), my perceptual<br/>impression appears to be a matter of tuning the 8:9 directly, and &quot;hearing&quot;<br/>scale step 5 in imagination is not required for locking in the tuning.</p><p>Higher stacks would have to compete with intervals having simpler ratios, I<br/>would think.

My &quot;mystery&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; has to do with an apparent singer preference for the high third in either or<br/>&gt;&gt; both. I hope I didn&apos;t give the impression that I believe the 4:5:6 triad is<br/>&gt;&gt; not the &quot;real one.&quot; I simply would like to explore possible rationalizations<br/>&gt;&gt; regarding the other one.</p><p>Bob commented:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, IF the &quot;high third&quot; was 14/11, AND the minor seventh was 7/4, then<br/>&gt; you get an 11/8 between them... for some reason, I think I&apos;ll want some<br/>&gt; extra water with that.</p><p>LOL.

The resulting 18:22:27:33<br/>[= 1/66:1/54:1/44:1/36] chord is a nice mellow one to<br/>my ears.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [Bob Valentine, TD 491.3]<br/>&gt;&gt; Well, IF the &quot;high third&quot; was 14/11, AND the minor seventh<br/>&gt;&gt; was 7/4, then you get an 11/8 between them... for some reason,<br/>&gt;&gt; I think I&apos;ll want some extra water with that.</p><p>&gt; [Jerry Eskelin, TD 492.16]<br/>&gt; LOL. But isn&apos;t 11/8 the &quot;in the cracks&quot; tritone that appears<br/>&gt; in the natural partial series? If so, I&apos;ll have mine straight,<br/>&gt; thank you. Just how that translates to the third/seventh of<br/>&gt; the dominant seventh chord I&apos;m not sure, but it seems like<br/>&gt; something worth exploring.</p><p>&gt;&gt; [Bob]<br/>&gt;&gt; Otherwise, numerical fiddling gets me into &quot;high sevenths&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; to go along with the &quot;high third&quot;.</p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; I like high thirds and low sevenths where dominant function<br/>&gt; is in effect.</p><p>In fact, the chord Bob suggested is just such a one.</p><p>With the ratios 1/1 - 14/11 - 3/2 - 7/4, it has the<br/>otonal proportions 44:56:66:77 (compare 44:55:66:77<br/>= 4:5:6:7), and can be described with smaller numbers<br/>as an utonal proportion 1/42:1/33:1/28:1/24.</p><p>It sounds to me like a very effective &apos;dominant 7th&apos; chord<br/>in need of resolution, as opposed to the smooth and stable<br/>4:5:6:7 &apos;harmonic 7th chord&apos;.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

In addition to the above, to a sustained (octaves<br/>&gt; ignored here) 4:6:7:9 drone,  Young and Riley would take turns<br/>&gt; going to the 9:8 above the 7, giving a complete chord of<br/>&gt; 32:48:56:63:72. They would lock into this dissonance by<br/>&gt; listening closely to beats, making sure that the beating<br/>&gt; did not change speed.</p><p>I made a MIDI file of this too<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/young9.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/young9.mid</a><br/>and agree that it&apos;s a really gorgeous chord; I lust after<br/>hearing the real thing with live instruments and voices.<br/>With such a rich chord, it must have been a real excercise<br/>to keep that 32:63 in tune.</p><p>If find the sonorous beauty of this chord especially<br/>interesting, because one of the most treasured new additions<br/>to my library is a copy of Boomsliter/Creel 1962 recently<br/>given to me by Erv Wilson (and apparently Erv got it from<br/>Boomsliter himself), in which they analyze Bessie Smith&apos;s<br/>vocal in _Empty Bed Blues_ as emphasizing (in C major blues)<br/>a 21/16 F, 75/64 Eb, and 63/32 C thru most of the song,<br/>only going to 4/3 F, 7/6 Eb and 1/1 C at the very end.<br/>I made a MIDI file of this too, with a very simple (since<br/>I&apos;m not familiar with the actual recording) 12-tET piano<br/>accompaniment:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/emptybed.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/emptybed.mid</a></p><p>REFERENCE<br/>---------<br/>Boomsliter, Paul C. and Creel, Warren.  1962.<br/>  _Interim Report on the Project on<br/>  Organization in Auditory Perception<br/>  at the State University College, Albany, New York_.</p><p>Joseph L.
