I worked<br/>on adapting my intonation according to what I was hearing, and later, when<br/>encountering the concepts of JI, had the proverbial light bulb go on. It<br/>continues to fascinate me that supposedly unschooled &apos;folk&apos; musicians of<br/>various cultures have universally adopted a very natural form of intonation<br/>to create their musics.</p><p>For many years, it had been a pet peeve of mine to hear slide players<br/>working hard to match their slide notes to ET fretted notes, the deeper I<br/>get into JI and microtonality, the more annoyed I now become when I hear<br/>this being done. I was recently listening to a borrowed instructional video<br/>of a very respected acoustic slide player, and had to turn it off, as he was<br/>playing his bottlenecked thirds and sevenths in 12ET. Arghh.</p><p>More and more I consider these examples to be distortion as opposed to<br/>interpretation. I&apos;m hearing way too many folk recordings by modern groups<br/>whose interpretation is clean up folk music to western music standards. To<br/>my way of thinking, this tends to dumb down the music, the best folk music<br/>is not afraid to be edgy and raw. Interestingly, it&apos;s not that I think that<br/>every instrument playing this music needs to be tuned strictly JI, I love<br/>the tension created by the juxtaposition between JI thirds and sevenths in a<br/>voice, slide guitar or fiddle against the fixed 12 ET pitch of the guitar,<br/>banjo or piano.</p><p>BTW, I offer my definition of folk to describe either traditional dance<br/>music and/or songs of a particular culture, as opposed to the common<br/>perception of folk these days as a singer/songwriter playing guitar.</p><p>Thanks for listening to my thoughts on this cold, windy day in New<br/>Hampshire.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>&quot;Music is far, far older than our species. It is tens of millions of years<br/>old, and the fact that animals as wildly divergent as whales, humans and<br/>birds come out with similar laws for what they compose suggests to me that<br/>there are a finite number of musical sounds that will entertain the<br/>vertebrate brain.&quot;</p><p>              Roger Payne, president of Ocean Alliance, quoted in NY Times</p></div>
