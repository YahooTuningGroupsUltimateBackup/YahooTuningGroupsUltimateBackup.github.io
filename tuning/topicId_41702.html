Thus there are filter and<br/>wave-table based sounds that can be tuned &quot;perfectly&quot;  (though they can<br/>also be twisted and distorted into distuned sounds as well), and there are<br/>samples of a deliberately &quot;out-of-tune&quot; piano, that can be tuned close to<br/>a desired exact pitch, but never exactly (because the samples themselves<br/>contain beatings);  and finally<br/>a major part of the piece was the use of lots of er. . . &quot;concrete&quot; or<br/>noise sounds, inter-mixed with the more &quot;intentionally pitched&quot; stuff.<br/>Part of the way I made the piece involved a &quot;gestural database engine,&quot;<br/>where I could specify the shape of a musical gesture in various parameters<br/>(for example:  some high, sharp attack sounds, followed by long-duration<br/>agitated middle-register sounds, or the like. . .), and the &quot;engine&quot; would<br/>look through a database of musique concrete sounds and find some that fit<br/>the gesture.</p><p>Some times I could ask for pitches with these, and it would find a sound<br/>fairly close in pitch to what I wanted. . .</p><p>but the point is that the piece moves between different degrees of<br/>&quot;messiness&quot; in regards to the tuning---perhaps a musical parameter that<br/>we&apos;re not always aware of, but that informs a lot of great music from<br/>gamelan to string quartet.</p><p>C Bailey</p></div>
