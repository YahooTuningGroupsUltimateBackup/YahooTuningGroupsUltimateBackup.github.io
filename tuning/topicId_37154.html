I just used their online form to inquire about the microtonal support in FM7, in particular about whether it at least supported TX-802/DX-7II type tuning tables &amp; resolution. I got a reply the next day from Daniel Richter            , Native Instruments Online Marketing Assistant, saying that the FM7 did support microtunings to a &quot;high resolution&quot; and that I should try the demo.</p><p>By this time I&apos;d found out it only supported 12 note tunings, and I&apos;d seen that there&apos;s been previous communication between members of this list &amp; NI regarding implementation of the MIDI Tuning Standard. So, I responded by letting him know about this and that besides considering implementing the MIDI Tuning Standard, FM7 should be able to import &amp; implement tuning tables that exist in Yamaha&apos;s SY, DX, &amp; TX machines, which I pointed out were still very much in use by microtonalists &amp; others.</p><p>I also pointed him to this list &amp; the Tuning list as places to find people who are seriously interested in this sort of thing.</p><p>Daniel replied thanking me for my input. So, the more voices that they hear asking for this kind of support, the better the chances they&apos;ll make the effort.</p><p>So, give it a shot, go to <a href="http://www.native-instruments.de">http://www.native-instruments.de</a> &amp; send them a message using the feedback form.</p><p>I don&apos;t think sample-playback synths are good for microtonality, which (I believe) by it&apos;s nature requires pure synthesis - FM, additive, physical modeling, analog, whatever. My perception is that it&apos;s purer from fundamental to overtones. Sounds that are born at their designated pitch behave more realistically, like actual acoustic instruments, which is a good thing if you happen to write for acoustic instruments. I&apos;m speaking from an end-user, low-technical-speak threshold, just-want-to-turn-it-on-and-make-music point of view.</p><p>While I&apos;m at it, just want to let any French footie fans on the list know I still have my fingers crossed. Of course the fingers on my other hand are crossed for Portugal. You never know... Ooh, Germany just made 8-0...!!!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Joel</p></div><h3><a id=37157 href="#37157">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;joelrodrigues@mac.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2002 11:31:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Saturday, June 1, 2002, at 10:14 , <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Communications with NI re.

It seems that some are intimidated by the big list.<br/>Some want to be with more immediate friends, or to vent, or to wax<br/>mathematical, etc.</p><p>The difficulty is in the extended bureaucracy of managing the information.<br/>It may reflect increasing regionalization, favorites in technology and tuning<br/>approach, or reflect hurt feelings in what are sometimes very tough<br/>commentary.</p><p>Regardless, an already fragmented study (microtonality) is further<br/>fragmented.  But there is less mail in the box, good for some, bad for<br/>others.  I&apos;m not sure anything will change.

Before<br/>that there *was* only one list, and for many years.</p><p>Several people, including myself, were opposed to the splinter lists,<br/>but we have been &quot;outvoted&quot; by the majority.</p><p>Many people did not want overly math-intensive posts on this list and<br/>the people who *did* want them felt inhibited since there was so<br/>much &quot;carping&quot; about them:  hence the &quot;Tuning Math List.&quot;</p><p>Many people really wanted to concentrate on *making microtonal music*<br/>and felt that the present list was too &quot;snippy,&quot; critical, and<br/>theoretical all the time:  hence the *MakeMicroMusic* list.</p><p>And many people felt that matters that do not pertain to tuning<br/>should not be on the main list.  This splitoff was actually one of<br/>the first:  *MetaTuning* list.</p><p>So, Joel, I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re outvoted on this, as are several other<br/>people who would prefer *one* list.  So, you&apos;ll just have to try to<br/>keep up with the three main ones, as *I* do now.</p><p>Frankly, as it turns out, I&apos;m beginning to think the splintering<br/>decision was right after all.  Each separate community has its own<br/>*flavor* and tends to encourage particular discussions.  I guess I<br/>didn&apos;t realize it would happen like that when I originally opposed<br/>the &quot;splitoffs.&quot;</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=37178 href="#37178">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;joelrodrigues@mac.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2002 11:08:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Joe, Johnny, and everyone else,</p><p>&gt; As a &quot;newbie&quot; here,<br/>And I&apos;ll always remain so in many ways, but I&apos;ve been around since 1998. It&apos;s complicated, unnecessary, &amp; uninteresting.</p><p>I understand what you both are saying, and I did see some of the discussion of the time the splits occurred. It&apos;s all more than a little sad though, isn&apos;t it ?</p><p>Nice to know that both of you and probably many others (there are 500+ groupies aren&apos;t there ?) share some of my naive idealism. I know the tuning list &amp; it&apos;s many illustrious members have served an important function &amp; has helped add to the wealth of knowledge about microtonality. But in many ways it fails miserably, and perhaps it may just as well be remarked upon that microtonality may yet succeed in becoming the norm someday, *in spite of* the tuning list.</p><p>I think it&apos;s easily demonstrable that most constructive &amp; tangible progress in microtonality continues to take place outside the tuning list &amp; it&apos;s direct sphere of influence.</p><p>Still, these lists remain interesting places to be, to learn in, &amp; most importantly, to meet others who share our interests.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Joel</p></div><h3><a id=37180 href="#37180">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/3/2002 12:20:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My response is to scan other lists on occasion, but to post foremost to the<br/>big list.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
