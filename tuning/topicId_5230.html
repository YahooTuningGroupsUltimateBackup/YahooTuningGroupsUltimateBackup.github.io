Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com">PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com</a>&gt;</p><p> Maybe Ferneyhough was using his ears? &gt;&gt;</p><p>I suspect that he was mainly using his eyes. F. isn&apos;t a performer himself,<br/>and his recent use of the computer is limited to some notational and<br/>algorithmic assistance, not audio output, so he doesn&apos;t have the means to<br/>hear what he is composing except in his imagination.  His statements on pitch<br/>practice are somewhat contradictory: on the one hand he wants to hear<br/>tempered pitches as themselves and not approximations of just intervals, or<br/>the other, he is not particularly fussy about precise intonation.  Thus, his<br/>quartertone notation may or may not be prescribing 24tet.  Presented with the<br/>unruly set of pitches used in his _String Trio_, I was really curious to know<br/>what he might be after, in both the case where the 24tet is played precisely<br/>and the case where it is only approximate.</p><p>I recall that the criteria F. used to select the source chords in a piano<br/>piece was something like their &quot;ungainlyness&quot;.  So he does operate with an<br/>implicit, if primitive, theory of consonance, and an empirical one at that,<br/>but not one that appears to have been formalized in any way.  While his<br/>complex rhythmic notation is intended to create a form of rubato, I had hoped<br/>that his use of microtones was intended to do more than to create more than a<br/>&quot;rubato with pitches&quot;.  I have no objection to that idea, but find the means<br/>F. uses -- the over-precise notation -- to be out of proportion.</p><p>There is an interesting paradox concerning the complexity of a set of<br/>pitches.  The complexity could be measured in terms of the number of ways in<br/>which the pitches might be associated with one another (i.e. the number of<br/>connections on an interval lattice), yet the larger the number of those<br/>connections, the shorter the algorithm will be for constructing the entire<br/>set, which is another measure of complexity.  Thus, pitch sets like an<br/>Eikosany or the 12tet aggregate can be constructed in rather short algorithms<br/>although -- and because -- they are both extremely rich in internal<br/>relationships. A set like that found in F.&apos;s _String Trio_ requires a fairly<br/>long algorithm to construct, yet is less rich in internal relationships.<br/>Since &quot;complexity&quot; is practically F.&apos;s trade mark, the issue has to be<br/>explored.</p></div>
