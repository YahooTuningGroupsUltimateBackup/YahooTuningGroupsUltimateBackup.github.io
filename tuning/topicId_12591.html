I am mailing it to you as an attachment.<br/>&gt;Let me know if it works for you this way.  I could<br/>&gt;send it as a .ZIP file or something if not.</p><p>&gt;Cheers,<br/>&gt;Christopher</p><p>Thanks, Christopher, so much for this, and thanks, also to Carl Lumma<br/>for his, as usual, illuminating post.</p><p>However, it does seem this process is a tad more involved than a<br/>&quot;simple&quot; copy and paste.</p><p>I have taken the &quot;liberty&quot; of creating a folder in the &quot;files&quot;<br/>section of egroups called, &quot;Schulter sound files.&quot;  neogw17a.scl is<br/>now in that folder.</p><p>Ms. Schulter, if for some reason you do NOT want this file available<br/>to all as a Scala file, please inform me immediately and I will<br/>delete it!  I am assuming, since the file was freely posted to the<br/>list as text, that this will not be a problem...</p><p>Now there is a different &quot;problem&quot; that perhaps some<br/>technically-inclined individual can explain to me and solve.  While<br/>Christopher&apos;s Scala file that he created works GREAT when I save it<br/>directly to a folder... when I &quot;save link as&quot; from the egroups<br/>Webpage<br/>where I uploaded the file and try to open it in Scala I get a &quot;file<br/>is not a Scala file.&quot;</p><p>Why would that be??  I guess we&apos;re not &quot;there&quot; yet...</p><p>_________ ____ __ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
