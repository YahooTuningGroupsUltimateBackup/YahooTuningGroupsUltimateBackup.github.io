Especially where I leave the 1/1, 4/3, 3/2, 2/1 stable. 11<br/>Limit intervals for instance are not found in the first 8 harmonics,<br/>yet 11/9 @ 347.408 and 18/11 @ 852.592, are incredibly powerful<br/>melodic intervals. Neutral intervals are very exotic, but I&apos;ve seen<br/>again and again that they can be sang. I conjecture that the reason<br/>this will work is because these exotic intervals are found by<br/>addition of the successive members of the harmonic series, so<br/>therefore sound correct over the harmonic drone. And where they may<br/>not be found in the first eight harmonics, gives one wonderful<br/>tensions and emotional flavors for melodic improvisation. Harmonic<br/>intervals seem to work in a relative way to me; not requiring all<br/>members of a scale to be a direct member of the linear harmonic<br/>series (but perhaps found by addition of its members) drone.</p><p>Thanks again for the posts - I&apos;m learning allot from them,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=20525 href="#20525">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>3/28/2001 7:37:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; As stated in an earlier message in the past, we can tune the<br/>tanpura<br/>&gt; in one of the three ways, depending upon whether the raga (i)<br/>&gt; includes G as one of the notes or not; (ii) includes a weak or a<br/>&gt; strong F; (iii) excludes both G and F, but includes F#.
