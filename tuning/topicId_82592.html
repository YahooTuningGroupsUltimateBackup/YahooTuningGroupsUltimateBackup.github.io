Until I was about 6 years old, the upride piano we had at home was tuned about a semitone lower than usual. Then, still going to the nursery school, I met some people there who were actually playing piano there somewhere. When I said I also knew how to play the piano and they allowed me to try, I realized everything was sounding higher than I expected. When I then went home and told my parents, they had almost no idea what I was talking about (neither of them is a musician, in fact). But anyway, they found a guy who got the piano &iuml;&iquest;&half;in tune&iuml;&iquest;&half; and then it was okay for me. :-D</p><p>Speaking about the possibility of deliberately switching to a different pitch reference while hearing music, I started thinking about that at the times I first became interested in early music. But anyway, I was more or less successful in learning to do that because, as I&iuml;&iquest;&half;ve said, I had already experienced &iuml;&iquest;&half;too-low-tuned&iuml;&iquest;&half; pianos earlier. What would probably be much more frustrating for me would be if Baroque orchestras should be using an A4 of, let&iuml;&iquest;&half;s say, 460Hz. You know what ... Recordings of old church organs are still a great deal of a problem for me because of these very same reasons. Many of them really are tuned remarcably higher than what we use today.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2009 6:18:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle Aho&quot; &lt;kalleaho@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello Michael,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if you insist on using Phi as the period of your irrational basis scale, why not try Phi^(1/Phi), the Phith root of Phi, about 1.34636082003 or 514.878118846 cents, as the generator?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-903e-text">http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-903e-text</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This talks about successive multiples Mod[h n, 1] of a number but has consequences for generated scales i.e. Phith root of the period as the generator will &quot;maximize the average difference of successive values&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The moments of symmetry are at Fibonacci numbers and the log-frequency ratio between large and small steps is Phi!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This seems to hit many small number ratios quite closely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kalle Aho<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Kalle,</p><p>I was following the Wolfram thread you posted and out of curiosity went to the intro where it started with something like &quot;300 years ago science discovered that mathematical equations could be used to describe the natural world&quot;. But this is a terrible historical anachronism, inaccurate by about 2200 years. In A History of Greek Philosophy, W.K.C. Guthrie states &grave;There has been general agreement among scholars that the numerical explanation of the universe was a generalization from a notable discovery made by Pythagoras himselfFrom Cornford we have:</p><p>the original source of the theory, Pythagoras&apos;s discovery (circa 570 B.C) that the concordant intervals of the musical scale or &apos;harmony&apos; could be expressed exactly in terms of the &grave;simple&apos; ratios. Pythagoras was capable of abstracting this complex of conceptions from the particular case of sound. It must have been a flash of inspired insight that he saw in it a formula of universal application. &apos;</p><p>So given that the current western education system is keyed towards this &apos;scientific&apos; rewriting of history, it is hardly surprising to find that even musicians are largely unfamiliar with their very own heritage, this despite the more recent discovery that waves do in fact govern the universe. Relating back to the chapter you posted, the Fibbonachi series is a subset of the natural numbers, which means that superimposing waves of frequencies 1,2,3,5,8,13...will simply produce a periodic wave of frequency 1. And as for their limit PHI, this is an irrational number and has no common period. Being a painter I use the golden mean all the time. But in attempting to bring music and art together, I tried for years to find a musical meaning for it and had to conclude that it was all just &quot;Phi in the sky&quot; (boom boom). In other words, it was music which put maths and science on the map, not the other way around, and I have since learnt not to apply maths to music without going to the source - waves.</p><p>-Ricardo</p></div><h3>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2009 6:40:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick wrote:</p><p>&gt; Relating back to the chapter you posted, the Fibbonachi series<br/>&gt; is a subset of the natural numbers, which means that superimposing waves<br/>&gt; of frequencies 1,2,3,5,8,13...will simply produce a periodic wave<br/>&gt; of frequency 1.

Most of the absolute listeners that were tested in this respect identified the C-major tones more reliably and, except for B, more quickly than the five &quot;black key&quot; tones,[14] which corresponds to the higher prevalence of these tones in ordinary musical experience. One study of Dutch non-musicians also<br/> demonstrated a bias toward using C-major tones in ordinary speech, especially on syllables related to emphasis.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This may explain why certain people &quot;have a<br/> tendency to hear<br/> anything near A tone as nothing but an A tone&quot;, for example: they have trained their minds to summarize most everything (even random noises like car horns) into basic diatonic scales.<br/>_______________________________________________________<br/>Also from wikipedia</p><p>&quot;The &apos;unlearning theory&apos;, first proposed by Abraham,[43] has recently been revived by developmental psychologists who argue that every person possesses absolute pitch (as a mode of perceptual processing) as an infant, but that a shift in cognitive processing styles (from local, absolute processing to global, relational processing) causes most people to unlearn it; or, at least, causes children with musical training to discard absolute pitch as they learn to identify musical intervals.&quot;<br/>_______________________________________________________<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; My take on this is that, by learning 12TET, we have taught ourselves to recognize &quot;perfect pitch&quot; in the context of if they match<br/> 12TET INTERVALS<br/> rather than the purity of actual tones (in unison IE without intervals) vs. where our basilar membranes can process them most clearly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>________________________________________________________________<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I showed the same two tones to my non-musically trained girlfriend and two of my non-musically trained friends (blind-testing: didn&apos;t tell them which was which)...and every single time they taught middle-C * 1.257 sounded better than middle-C * 5/4 (1.25)!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

I myself can very clearly distinguish absolute pitches but<br/>&gt; anyway I think many people simply hear what they &bdquo;wish to hear&ldquo;.<br/>&gt; Considering, for instance, the example of transposing music into different<br/>&gt; keys, I could say that it depends on two things: A) what instruments and<br/>&gt; what tuning you use, B) where you set your A (or C or whatever). For<br/>&gt; example, I can quite happily convince myself that now the A4 is at 440Hz and<br/>&gt; in another piece the A4 is at 415Hz (serious problems start arising when the<br/>&gt; A gets<br/> outside this range to about 400Hz or 460Hz or some such). Let&rsquo;s take<br/>&gt; an example of some music played in Pythagorean tuning in the key of C major<br/>&gt; at the standard pitch (i.e. A4 = 440Hz).If this was played on an old piano<br/>&gt; or on a harpsichord and if it was harmonically similar to some Baroque<br/>&gt; music, then I would very quickly ask: &bdquo;Hey, isn&rsquo;t it actually Db played in a<br/>&gt; well temperament?&ldquo; And from then on, I may tak&eacute; a completely different view<br/>&gt; on the piece even though I previously considered it to be C. And suddenly, I<br/>&gt; may say: &bdquo;So it&rsquo;s pretty full of accidentals&ldquo;. But if the same piece of<br/>&gt; music was played on instruments whose tuning I am completely unsure about, I<br/>&gt; would probably consider it to be C played in Pythagorean because it&rsquo;s the<br/>&gt; way I&rsquo;m used to recognizing pitches or chords. Likewise, if I hear music in<br/>&gt; B major played in a meantone-like tuning<br/> with older instruments, I&rsquo;ll<br/>&gt; probably think it should be C major with an A4 of about 415Hz, while if the<br/>&gt; same piece in the same tuning were played on a modern Steinway grand or<br/>&gt; something, I would probably consider it more &bdquo;tonally distant&ldquo; because I<br/>&gt; would call it B major. But generally, it&rsquo;s usually okay for me to recognize<br/>&gt; pitches with the A4 being 440Hz and it&rsquo;s more difficult for me when I have<br/>&gt; to intentionally convince myself to choose something else as the A.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&nbsp; <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning<br/> group.<br/>&nbsp; <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&nbsp; <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&nbsp; tuning-digest@...m - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&nbsp; <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&nbsp; <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>Yahoo!

The text doesn&apos;t say that the reason for Pavarotti demanding tuning to 438Hz was that he found it more &quot;pleasing to his ear&quot; than 440Hz. Secondly, don&apos;t forget that in some countries, even about 20 years ago, it was quite &quot;frequent&quot; to tune instruments to an A4 of about 435Hz (don&apos;t know about Italy, but generally, people usually prefer what they were used to in their childhood or so). For another thing, I personally DO like 438Hz more than 440Hz -- you know why? Because I like lower pitches. If, for example, I hear something like 460Hz when listening to &quot;early music&quot;, then saying that &quot;the pitch has been lowered so 460Hz is now a B4&quot; is fine with me even though I &quot;internally&quot; think of it as a Bb instead of a B, while saying &quot;the pitch has been raised so 460Hz is now an A4&quot; makes me almost angry.</p><p>Finally, let me say something about my own experiments. Some of you may know that I have, during a few years of being heavily involved in that topic, made quite a bunch of &quot;quasi-meantone&quot; irregular temperaments with the aim of many intervals using precisely specified beat rates, in order the scales were easily tunable without electronic equipment. To get various &quot;configurations&quot; of beat rate possibilities, I often used different starting pitches, like an A4 of 438Hz for one scale, 437Hz for another one, 441Hz for another one, 430Hz for another one, 420Hz for another one, and many others. One day, I decided to use an A4 of 450Hz. I calculated the ratios from the specified beat rates, wrote them into Scala and played in the tuning for a while. And what happened? After about half an hour of improvising, I was so angry about the high A that I finally decided to use a different scale degree for A -- namely the one which originaly should have meant G, which was about 406Hz (even though I &quot;internally&quot; heard it as a G#). :-D Of course, by doing this, I eventually turned the Eb..G# chain of fifths to F..A#.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2009 3:30:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Andreas Sparschuh wrote:</p><p>&gt; Conclusion:<br/>&gt; Appearently Pavarotti considered the plain single frequency 438Hz<br/>&gt; as more consonant than the 2Hz higher 440Hz one.</p><p>No.  He preferred it for some reason.

For about the 100th time, I&apos;m NOT talking about scales ideal/convenient singing but for composition...and, for the record, those earlier examples in the thread about how conductors and singers choose to tune lower vs. higher were not mine or even vaguely related to my point: aligning tones to the basilar membrane in addition to finding pleasantly beating (as opposed to excessively beating) intervals.</p><p>&nbsp; Surely people don&apos;t use calculus because it&apos;s &quot;easier to produce&quot;, &quot;more obvious&quot;, &quot;more natural&quot; than algebra...so why does music theory all too often have to be as such (as is which the case of your &quot;singers tend to most easily...&quot; example)?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems obvious to me music has fallen through in many ways: while science and mathematics keeps on becoming exponentially more advanced,<br/> music theory so often becomes grounded to only &quot;what&apos;s obvious from what follow before&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; An extreme counter-example is quantum theory in physics, which has many ideas and theories toward it which are near polar opposites.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do very few common people care about mean-tone tunings or JI, for example (even when many synthesizers/keyboards come with such tunings as native options)?&nbsp;&nbsp; I swear it because such a vast majority of people can&apos;t hear that much of a difference between either of them and 12TET.&nbsp; Ask the average singer subconsciously singing JI and they may well still think he/she is singing 12TET.</p><p>&nbsp;

Personally I consider the works of Sethares and Wilson more<br/> closely equivalent to pre-calculus in a world where 12TET is more analogous to pre-algebra (another analogy: most business math is also pre-algebra...as a metaphor for the rather complacent recording industry).&nbsp; Wilson&apos;s MOS scales, for example, are not &quot;naturally rounded to by singers&quot; and, even though they are based on o-tonal and u-tonal relationships, can do things like allow 9-notes-per-octave while still guiding the mind to feel relaxed / &quot;have a good idea what&apos;s coming up next&quot;, even if the degree of consonance is significantly less than JI for such large scales.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So what would be the equivalent of calculus to music?&nbsp; I&apos;m pretty sure it would not come so naturally as something based on the same harmonic series evident in virtually all acoustic instruments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So why solve a problem already well solved in history...why not instead search for the solution to a larger problem?&nbsp; Pushing past<br/> the limitation of beats and making beats work in a way so a 7 to 9-note-per-octave chord is possible, researching&nbsp; things beyond intervals like how notes in unison at different tones are received by the ears and mind (ultimately MRI scans between different people could even give some pointers).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  NO, I&apos;m not saying I have the solution, but I am giving myself at least some credit for searching for it instead of sitting on my laurels.&nbsp; There&apos;s nothing &quot;PHI in the sky&quot; about it...already I had a brief e-mail exchange with Sethares and says some of the latest research (by a researcher of the last name &quot;Cook&quot;) use symmetry to build scales that, even in Sethares&apos;

You convinced me this, and not just critical band roughness, is a huge factor in consonance...and<br/> this prompted me to find other ways of acheiving a feel of periodicity BEYOND just use of the harmonic series.<br/>E) 12TET works well in particular b/c its tones are equally spaced...in virtually every scale I make I try to A) start with what sounds natural to my ears B) approach equally spaced tones as much as possible</p><p>And....that&apos;s just a handful of things I&apos;ve learned from you...I guess you could say my &quot;PROBLEM&quot;

Are you have some<br/>sort of consonance score for the unison?

The answer to that question is: the<br/>resolution of the basilar membrane varies, depending on the<br/>frequency and amplitude of the stimulus.  And it varies somewhat<br/>from person to person.  Other than that, it&apos;s fixed.  If you want<br/>to stimulate as few hairs as possible, the only thing you can do<br/>is play a pure sine tone at low volume and at a frequency where<br/>the membrane&apos;s resolution is highest.  You still will get dozens<br/>of hair cells moving, but anyway... ...does that answer your<br/>question?</p><p>&gt; --I highly doubt that.

Either that, or priming<br/>from consonance effects (if you&apos;re listening to other notes<br/>before the test note).</p><p>&gt;Basically; my theory is it tricks the mind into thinking there&apos;s<br/>&gt;more consonance than there is mathematically, thus helping form<br/>&gt;a &quot;different kind of periodicity&quot;.</p><p>Here&apos;s a great example of pseudoscientific bulls___.

There are difference tones<br/>--between the harmonics, not just the fundamentals.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I meant including the harmonics...that&apos;s what I meant by aligning timbre with tuning: the harmonics are the timbre.&nbsp; And no...the harmonics do not match the PHI relationship.&nbsp; However, they do point to (and are recognized by the brain as) the root tone (of course, that&apos;s the nature of the harmonic series)...and the root tone does follow the a/b = a+b/a relationship and each harmonic also has that relationship to the same harmonic of any other root tone.&nbsp; So, no, I&apos;m not using PHI-timbre and gaining &quot;a/b = a+b/a symmetry of timbre&quot;, but I am gaining that symmetry in root tones and the harmonic of any tone vs. the same number harmonic of any other tone.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>--- On Fri, 4/10/09, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Suggestion for Michael<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Friday, April 10, 2009, 3:54 PM</p><p>      --- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, djtrancendance@ ... wrote:</p><p>&gt; --Above, are you talking about a harmonic unison, a melodic</p><p>&gt; --unison, or just about single pitches? -CARL</p><p>&gt;    I believe, according to what the words sound like, closer to</p><p>&gt; single pitches as there is no concept of lending &quot;toward</p><p>&gt; monophonic melody&quot; in that part of my theory.</p><p>It may be worth mentioning that the definitions I gave of</p><p>harmonic interval, melodic interval, and unison are not</p><p>my definitions.
