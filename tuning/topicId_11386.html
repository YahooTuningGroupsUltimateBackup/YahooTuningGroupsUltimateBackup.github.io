I&apos;m not certain how Paul was able to do this, or what<br/>equipment he was using (he will probably explain subsequently), but it<br/>certainly does work.</p><p>I hope to have these great experimental files up on the little &quot;Tuning<br/>Lab&quot; <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site within a couple of days.  It will be the best<br/>experiment there yet!</p><p>I will let everyone know when they have been effectively posted!!!!</p><p>Thanks again to Paul, and thanks again in advance to any prospective<br/>listeners!!</p><p>____________ ______ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
