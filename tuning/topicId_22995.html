The generator of this scale is 13/31 oct. or approximately a 7:9.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Despite having lots of common ingrediants,<br/>&gt; &gt; I couldn&apos;t figure out a way that<br/>&gt; &gt; LssLssLs could map to 72 and preserve these<br/>&gt; &gt; identities.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; You must be making use of some of 31-tET&apos;s unison vectors that are<br/>&gt; not quite unisons in 72-tET. I&apos;m sure we could figure this out if we<br/>&gt; wanted to (do you want to?).<br/>&gt;</p><p>You are right and no, I don&apos;t have to find the mapping. I was a little<br/>surprised that it didn&apos;t pop out, but your point about unison vectors<br/>is exactly on target. Although I didn&apos;t work it out, I have no doubts<br/>that 31 and 72 will have a different way of connecting &apos;3&apos; to the<br/>other terms the same way they differ in connecting to &apos;5&apos;.</p><p>This revealed to me some assumptions I&apos;d had in this thread which were<br/>also too 31 oriented. I had sort of assumed that an EDO that could<br/>function as a meantone would have the augmented second map to the<br/>&quot;best 7/6&quot; and the augmented sixth to the &quot;best 7/4&quot;. A cursory glance<br/>at a few showed that this was not the case.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=23064 href="#23064">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2001 9:06:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul E, wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Yup.
