You can also add Rothernberg as a precursor on<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;the &quot;Diatonic set theory&quot; page, and do other things there, &gt;&gt;&gt;like linking to a specific definition of &quot;set theory&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;d like to get Carl&apos;s input here, since he&apos;s studied thiis stuff.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven&apos;t read the &quot;Diatonic set theory&quot; page, so I don&apos;t know<br/>&gt; if Rothenberg should be cited there.  You have the same<br/>&gt; Rothenberg papers I do.  Here is the Clampitt paper Graham&apos;s<br/>&gt; talking about (I think)...<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://theory.esm.rochester.edu/norman_carey/text/self_sim.pdf">http://theory.esm.rochester.edu/norman_carey/text/self_sim.pdf</a><br/>&gt; &gt; Comparisons to MOS are hard, since we don&apos;t have answers<br/>&gt; to all our questions about exactly what Erv was up to in<br/>&gt; the 60s, nor a rigorous definition of MOS.  Paul E. worked<br/>&gt; at this, but with a 3-step communication channel, and, I<br/>&gt; suspect, Erv&apos;s inability to think of concepts in such a<br/>&gt; rigid way, progress didn&apos;t really occur in the end.</p><p>Yes, but we can still mention the concept without a rigid definition. There&apos;s also the letter to John Chalmers and other papers at the Anaphorian site we can use to check what concepts he definitely thought of.  Unfortunately, I can&apos;t reach it now :(</p><p>&gt; There are several very closely related concepts:<br/>&gt; &gt; MOS (Wilson)<br/>&gt; well-formedness (Carey, Clampitt)<br/>&gt; Myhill&apos;s property (Myhill)<br/>&gt; distributional eveness (?)<br/>&gt; maximal eveness (Clough, Douthett)</p><p>Yes.  Currently well-formedness, Myhill&apos;s property and maximal evenness are listed but distributional evenness and MOS aren&apos;t.  There&apos;s also the simpler property of a generated collection.  The entry on this, that also covers well-formedness, explicitly states that both &quot;were first described by Norman Carey and David Clampitt in &grave;Aspects of Well-Formed Scales&apos; (1989).&quot;  That ain&apos;t true.  Whether Wilson&apos;s MOS is the same as Well-Formedness or not, he certainly described generated collections well before 1989 and should get credit for it.</p><p>&gt; One of the differences is whether non-octave periods are<br/>&gt; allowed.  IIRC, the latest is that they&apos;re not in MOS, but<br/>&gt; they are in DE.  So Paul&apos;s been using DE for everything.<br/>&gt; But it&apos;s far from clear as far as I&apos;m concerned, exactly what<br/>&gt; Erv intended, whose work came first, or if anyone should<br/>&gt; care.</p><p>I don&apos;t think anybody really thought about non-octave periods, and so as such I don&apos;t care what the precise definitions were.</p><p>&gt; Another hydra-headed concept is Rothenberg propriety, which<br/>&gt; I think is identical to Balzano &quot;coherence&quot; (I&apos;d have to<br/>&gt; check to be sure).  In this case Rothenberg was first.<br/>&gt; Though different from these two, Erv&apos;s &quot;constant structures&quot;<br/>&gt; does overlap them in places, and your &apos;epimorphism&apos; is<br/>&gt; close to CS, is it not?</p><p>Coherence is mentioned, but doesn&apos;t have an entry.  Yes, it&apos;s the same except that Balzano was talking about equal temperaments and Rothenberg strictly wasn&apos;t.  But there are other Rothenberg concepts that the diatonic set theory crowd are rediscovering so he should at least be a precursor.  He&apos;s really more a part of the crowd than Balzano except that nobody knows about him.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Is anybody familiar with the following paper?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Rahn, Jay (1977). &quot;Some Recurrent Features of Scales&quot;,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;In Theory Only 2, no. 11-12: 43-52.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Not I.

He&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; not writing poetry.<br/>&gt;&gt;      of course he uses math when it applies and doesn&apos;t use it where it doesn&apos;t apply to convey what he wants to get across<br/>&gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;  Once again there is nothing in the MOS concept that is limited to &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; octaves as i have repeatedly pointed out.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;       &gt;&gt; Unless Wilson actually gives a definition, how can one tell? Asking &gt;&gt; him has apparently produced the opposite result--that octave periods &gt;&gt; were what he *was* thinking of.<br/>None of Erv works refer to the consonant/ dissonance question and his silence on this question should give you a clue as to how he feels about it.<br/>Why would he be concerned with an octave as set in stone.</p><p>True he doesn&apos;t go out of his way to find non octave equivalent intervals, because he mentions then when he likes the sound of them.<br/>Most commonly in discussion of Indonesian scales and recurrent sequences</p><p>I cannot count the number of times i have had to go on this list and point out , that he is no locked into the octave.<br/>i have referred to scales , i learned from him that  i used on recordings, some before these list even existed.<br/>And who would this definition serve?<br/>not me i can make MOS&apos;s all day long with a problem and any one who has worked with him has also.<br/>If you think a definition is in order then write one and you can place it along the rest that most musicians will not read or care too.<br/>There is nothing clear about Rothenberg to me and like i said leaves out the secondary layers we find in say Japanese music.<br/>These scales are more common than MOS&apos;s around the world and really might be more important.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               &gt;&gt;   &gt;&gt;     -- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=66510 href="#66510">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/23/2006 9:15:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I should care if I&apos;m going to write or edit a Wikipedia article.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Myhill&apos;s property&quot; was a name cooked up by Clough and Myerson<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;When?
