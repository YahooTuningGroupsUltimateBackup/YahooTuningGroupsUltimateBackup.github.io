I should say at the outset that the restrictions are pretty severe.  Basically,<br/>you can get certain tetrachordal, heptatonic scales, and their modes, with a drone.  With some<br/>thought, that could be expanded somewhat within the confines of the principle behind the<br/>trick.  At least it allows some experimentation in JI to those guitarists among us who can&apos;t<br/>afford to have a guitar fretted to JI yet.  Here&apos;s the method/trick:</p><p>Leave your D string at D or maybe as much as a whole tone lower.  Tune the A string up to one<br/>scale degree below the D string.  Tune the G, B, and high E strings to consecutive scale<br/>degrees - in other words, tune everything except the low E as if you were tuning up a diatonic<br/>harp.  Tune the low E string down to a drone tone, usually the tonic of whatever scale you have<br/>chosen.  Use string harmonics to achieve (practically) Just relationships between all strings.</p><p>Now pluck the harmonics at the half and third positions of the 5 scale-degree-tuned strings.<br/>Since the third position harmonics are (obviously) 3/2 above the half position, the lower<br/>tetrachord will be available at the half position, and will duplicate itself a perfect fifth<br/>above at the third position, making a complete tetrachordal scale.  Obviously, you&apos;ve got the<br/>quarter position, too, simply adding another three notes of range.  Isn&apos;t there a name for<br/>this, when the lower and upper tetrachords of a scale contain the same intervals in the same<br/>order?  Iso-somethingorother?</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ve found it really enjoyable to play this way.  If you grow your right hand nails out<br/>a bit, it&apos;s easy to get used to playing all harmonics with four fingers on five strings, and<br/>periodically thumbing the drone.  Naturally, it&apos;s prone to medieval sounding music, my chief<br/>interest at present.  Once I get a break from my nightmarish schedule, I&apos;ll try to record and<br/>post some examples.  Might be a few weeks.</p><p>--<br/>David J.

Finnamore</p><p>Nice trick. The same sort of scale structure can be played on a bass<br/>guitar (especially with round-wound strings) without retuning, since<br/>the mass of the strings makes higher harmonics easier to produce.<br/>Locate the third, fourth and fifth harmonic on one of your strings<br/>(the third harmonic is almost right over the fifth fret on a 12tet<br/>guitar or bass, while the fourth and fifth are roughly over the<br/>fourth and third fret). These three form a just major triad 1/1 5/4<br/>3/2, and on a 4 string bass there are four of these a fourth apart.<br/>Here is the basic scale pattern, with the degrees from 1 to 10:</p><p>   3 4 5   fret number<br/>   | | |<br/>G   10 8<br/>    / /<br/>D  9 7 5<br/>    / /<br/>A  6 4 2<br/>    / /<br/>E  3 1</p><p>Using the triad 5/4 3/2 7/4 and the same fingering pattern, down<br/>roughly 1 fret results in a different scale.</p><p>The first scale is the basic scale used by the late Jaco Pastorius on<br/>his solo piece Portrait of Tracy from his debut album.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
