Zweifel&apos;s generalised<br/>diatonic scale is a mode of it; the only difference is that B is<br/>one step lower (1080 cents). Zweifel uses exactly the same letters<br/>as you. In the paper he gives a number of arguments why he considers<br/>this scale a generalisation of the major mode in 12-tET. The fact that<br/>20=4x5 and 12=3x4 being one of them. Zweifel&apos;s notation is also built<br/>into Scala (set notation z20).</p><p>Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p></div>
