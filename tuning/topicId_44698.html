Also, that many of you<br/>had a complete classic training and came alone in tuning research.<br/>I find interesting to speak a little bit about that because I teach about<br/>tuning in a musical school in France.<br/>There, most of the students are interested in vari&eacute;t&eacute; (french word that I<br/>don&sup1;t now how to translate well. I presume you will do it wellÂŠ) music and<br/>few of them in Jazz. It seems that about 20% of them will be professionnal<br/>musicians, which is not bad if we know that in French conservatory of music<br/>(classic), only less than 3% get in the profession.<br/>I started, 2 years ago with a workshop, 2 hours a week (about 60 hours a<br/>year) and 13 students. I introduce all of them to play harmonic flutes (that<br/>I previously made in plastic - PVC in french &shy; two times longer than the<br/>usuals ethnics one, more easy to manage in group). That was a good way to<br/>manage a group with very different people (experience, instruments practice,<br/>ageÂŠ). So all of them was there beginner. 4 objectifs in this : to whet<br/>cr&eacute;ativit&eacute;, to practice collectif playing (in a very different way than<br/>usual), to practice improvisation, to gave a minimum of culture g&eacute;n&eacute;rale (in<br/>France also , it is quite incredible that musicians don&sup1;t even think that a<br/>music scale have a historyÂŠ).<br/>In this workshop, I manage few theorical sessions about what is the sound<br/>(mostly to understand harmonic scale and manipulation of ratio).<br/>This works pretty well and the director of the school asked me to manage in<br/>a different way because I didn&sup1;t want to come every weeks to the school for<br/>2 hours (far away from my home). So, last year, I made only theorical &shy; no<br/>pratice &shy; on sound, harmonic scale and manipulation of ratio. With a very<br/>strong limit that many people in the small group (10 people (volontary) of<br/>130 students in the school) stop normal school very early. My bet was : I<br/>must be understood by anyone of them (I have here a very good argument,<br/>which is : I stopped school myself when I was 15 old). I did this in 4 days<br/>and I will soon make two more days on arabic and indian scales (with also a<br/>time to think about that we call in french &sup3;fusion&sup2; (different styles mixing<br/>ethnic an usual tonal or modal occidental music), necessary  in my mind<br/>because of the french colonialist past).<br/>Next year, I want absolutely speak about the new ways of tuning (not only<br/>ethnic). It&sup1;s why I came on this tuning list few weeks ago.<br/>In France this subject doesn&sup1;t seem to interest much people. We have Jacques<br/>Dudon, who make a very good job in both hand, a very powerfull research on<br/>coh&eacute;rence differentielle (and other thingsÂŠ) and in his musical production<br/>with synth&egrave;se photosonique. His research is published by CNRS (the very best<br/>level in research in France) and his music is fascinating quite everybody,<br/>even people far away from tuning research. He is now going strongly on<br/>psycho-acoustique problems.<br/>But I don&sup1;t want to make a lesson on Jacques Dudon, I want to open doors !<br/>It&sup1;s why I joined this group (tuning list) ; I need more material to show<br/>that it&sup1;s not only a french crazy one (I love himÂŠ) but a lot of people<br/>every where who are going on this matter.  I could speak about Partch (for<br/>exemple) but I don&sup1;t want to. I want to speak about people doing today. I<br/>want to push my students in a research way and stimulate invention, even I<br/>don&sup1;t care what they will do with thisÂŠ</p><p>I hope you will excuse my very bad English writing (also that you will<br/>understand the matter I speak aboutÂŠ).</p><p>Anyway, i have very good time reading you, even I am sure I lose a lot,<br/>because my poor experience of your language (english and technical ; great<br/>thanks to Monzo for his very usefull dictionnary).</p><p>Any one of you can contact me, off list, to tell me about his experience in<br/>music playing, teaching, records production and so onÂŠ but, please, try to<br/>use a language simple as possible (it&sup1;s because my headache).</p><p>Gilles Patrat</p></div>
