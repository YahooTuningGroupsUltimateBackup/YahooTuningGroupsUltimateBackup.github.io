Oh no!</h1><h3><a id=8471 href="#8471">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2000 9:30:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks to Joe Monzo for clarifying his description of the Riemann<br/>&quot;functional harmony&quot; theory as appeared originally (at least to me) in TD<br/>523:6, and then recently was elaborated in TD 526:8.</p><p>I must confess it was not clear to me from the original TD 523:6 post that<br/>the Reimann theory was like a gigantic &quot;gravitational&quot; field with the<br/>entire span of dominant Pythagorean fifths implied by the formula<br/>3^(-1,0,1).</p><p>Isn&apos;t it amazing how a little formula like that can, with a few brush<br/>strokes, be so global, so all-encompassing, so CLEAR?? ( ;-),  :-) )</p><p>For me, it looked like, Joe, you were just &quot;labeling&quot; diatonic triads with<br/>I, IV or V in a &quot;gross&quot; over- symplification.</p><p>Also, even if you did have the &quot;global pull&quot; in mind and the overall &quot;force<br/>field&quot; of Pythagorean fifths in mind and were labeling according to this,<br/>some of the labels were wrong!</p><p>For example, you quote again from our Forte exchange in TD 526:8:</p><p>  &gt; [Forte, quoted by Joe Pehrson]<br/>                 &gt; Functionally, however, the supertonic triad has little<br/>                 &gt; relationship to the tonic triad.  By virtue of the 5th<br/>                 &gt; relationship II always functions as a dominant<br/>preparation.</p><p>                 &gt; [monz referring to Riemann]<br/>                 &gt; II            Subdominant (sometimes Dominant, I think)</p><p>Here you have the II supertonic &quot;classified&quot; as a &quot;subdominant&quot; [well, OK,<br/>SOMETIMES, dominant], which it clearly is not.  It is, of course, your most<br/>basic V of V relationship.</p><p>The II is clearly on the V &quot;side.&quot;</p><p>BTW, I think terming these &quot;force fields&quot; as &quot;sides&quot; or  &quot;elaborations&quot; is<br/>better than saying that anything is being &quot;replaced,&quot; since it isn&apos;t.  In<br/>the simple chord progression I-vi-ii-V-I, it&apos;s meaningless to say that the<br/>V is being &quot;replaced&quot; all the time.  If so, why not just go I-V-V-V-I.<br/>This would not lead to the most interesting of musics...</p><p>You state in TD 526:8:<br/>&gt; The whole point of having the new qualifier &apos;functional&apos; added to<br/>&apos;harmony&apos; is to explain the &gt;secondary chord-roots as &apos;substitutes&apos; for the<br/>three primary functions.</p><p>I guess it all depends on what a person means by the term &quot;substitutes.&quot;<br/>Why not go &quot;all the way&quot; and say that the V is a &quot;substitute&quot; for the I?<br/>In this case you could ultimately create a piece with only ONE CHORD, or<br/>maybe even only ONE NOTE!  (Tom Johnson has done it already...)</p><p>Additionally, your historical research may be accurate, and Riemann may<br/>have been the very first to come out with the term &quot;functional harmony,&quot;<br/>but I can assure you the limited definition you give to this term (as<br/>contrasted with &quot;traditional harmony&quot;) is NOT the way this term in used in<br/>the major music conservatories of this country.  [I know since I&apos;ve been in<br/>some...]  &quot;Functional harmony&quot; as it is taught today, IS &quot;traditional<br/>harmony,&quot;  at least as it&apos;s taught in the schools.  Perhaps, yes, the term<br/>has been bastardized and does not have it&apos;s original Riemann meaning, but<br/>terms CHANGE over time.</p><p>Let&apos;s continue with the &quot;analysis&quot;:</p><p>   &gt; [Forte, quoted and edited by Joe Pehrson]<br/>                 &gt; It is important to notice that III does NOT serve as a<br/>                 &gt; dominant preparation.  On the contrary, it occurs as a<br/>SUFFIX<br/>                 &gt; to V.  [Joey P&apos;s caps] it also occurs as a suffix to I.</p><p>                 &gt; [monz referring to Riemann]<br/>                 &gt;III          Tonic or Dominant</p><p>                &gt; Note that V (dominant) and I (tonic) are precisely the<br/>                &gt; functions I specified.</p><p>OK, so you have the same triads listed here, but Fortes ENTIRE IDEA was<br/>that the III Mediant chord was NOT immediately related or &quot;substituting&quot;<br/>[to use the dreaded word] for EITHER IV OR V.</p><p>Again, from my quotations in TD 525:20 from Forte:</p><p>&gt;&quot;III (Mediant) in the Major Mode&quot; [don&apos;t forget that &quot;key&quot; term,<br/>literally]  &quot;It is important to notice &gt;that III does NOT serve as a<br/>dominant preparation.  On the contrary, it occurs as a SUFFIX to V.  &gt;[Joey<br/>P&apos;s caps] it also occurs as a suffix to I.  THUS III IS QUITE DISTANT FROM<br/>BOTH &gt;ELEMENTS OF THE HARMONIC AXIS, AND IS RELATED TO THEM ONLY THROUGH<br/>VI.&quot;</p><p>I note that in your recent post of 526:8 you &quot;conveniently&quot; leave out the<br/>final capitalized sentence, which is the meaning Forte wished to convey in<br/>the ENTIRE PARAGRAPH.</p><p>So now, how we gonna classify III?  Tonic, subdominant, or dominant??  Does<br/>that really mean anything. No.  Only in relation to VI, which is on the &quot;V<br/>force field&quot; side.  The important part in traditional harmony -- and, as I<br/>say, this is called &quot;functional harmony&quot; today, perhaps erroneously, but<br/>that&apos;s what it&apos;s called -- is that the III is so INDEPENDENT.  It&apos;s an<br/>AC-DC kind of chord.  (Oh my!)</p><p>Frankly, Joe, I don&apos;t think you like traditional theory or harmonic<br/>analysis very much, and this is why you&apos;re glossing over this stuff so<br/>cursorily.</p><p>More errors:</p><p>I note that you &quot;conveniently&quot; avoided mentioning the submedient VI in your<br/>recent rejoinder.  Maybe that was because the original classification was<br/>so wrong in the first place.</p><p>Here was your &quot;original&quot; post of  523:6<br/>     &gt;              VII        Dominant or Subdominant<br/>    &gt;                VI        Tonic or Subdominant<br/>          &gt;           V        Dominant<br/>          &gt;        IV        Subdominant<br/>          &gt;       III        Tonic or Dominant<br/>          &gt;       II        Subdominant (sometimes Dominant, I think)<br/>         &gt;          I        Tonic</p><p>          &gt;    So typically, in an analysis, every chord is marked either<br/>          &gt;  &apos;T&apos;, &apos;S&apos;, or &apos;D&apos;.</p><p>Note that you have VI as the &quot;Tonic or Subdominant.&quot;  VI is you most simple<br/>V of V of V... and it would MOST CERTAINLY be on the V side of the &quot;force<br/>field&quot; NOT on the subdominant.</p><p>From my TD 525:20 post:<br/>&gt;again from Forte.  (Don&apos;t trust ME for a minute...):</p><p>&gt;We have seen that VI  SERVES AS A DOMINANT PREPARATION BOTH IN MAJOR AND<br/>IN &gt;MINOR. [NB, NB!]  Often it follows I immediately, providing the first<br/>cue to progression toward V.&quot;</p><p>So even if we go with the acceptance that your nice little formula<br/>3^(-1,0,1) explains everything there is to know about tonal music, the<br/>&quot;assignments&quot; to the basic force fields were incorrect.</p><p>I agree with you that theory needs to evolve and some of the older methods<br/>need further elaboration with mathematics and, certainly, with microtonal<br/>implications.  However, I firmly believe that the traditional methods of<br/>realizing figured bass and, especially, four part writing are what<br/>separates the &quot;sheep from the goats&quot; as far as composers are concerned.<br/>You can tell right away the people who have never had this &quot;basic training&quot;<br/>as composers.  There are more than enough of them out there...  [BTW Allen<br/>Forte has EXCELLENT exercises in figured bass and 4-part harmonization in<br/>_Tonal Harmony in Concept and Practice_ and I have to admit, I managed to<br/>do most of them...]</p><p>One of the limitations of the conventional, _Stufen_ - theory, although I<br/>must in my defense state that I am not mired in it... is the fact that it<br/>doesn&apos;t do a very good job describing the process of MODULATION...<br/>Everything is described with a chord symbol, but the overall<br/>&quot;gravitational&quot; implications are not always made clear.  A good resource is<br/>Elie Siegmeister&apos;s _Harmony and Melody_ which is still available from<br/>Wadsworth Publishing Company of Belmont, CA.  Elie does a great job<br/>describing modulation, and the conditions required before one is _really_<br/>in a new key.  It&apos;s more complex than one might imagine, and is determined<br/>by a number of factors, one of which is, most reasonably, the length of the<br/>section in the new key.  His four conditions of modulation are &quot;1.)<br/>Establishment of the home key, 2.)Use of a pivot chord 3.) Entry into the<br/>new key and 4.) Establishment of the new key.&quot;  I have to admit that the<br/>&quot;step by step&quot; old fashioned roman numeral chord labeling didn&apos;t handle<br/>these concepts adequately. [Elie also happened to be a friend of mine...<br/>but enough of &apos;name dropping&apos; at the moment]</p><p>Regarding Schenker... yes he was a strange one.  However, unless you have<br/>done countless Schenkerian analyses, as some of us have, you most probably<br/>will not fully realize the implications of his approach.  As an active<br/>composer, I am fully aware of the importance of pitch level to the contour<br/>of a piece of music, especially regarding points of arrival in the matrix<br/>of 3^(1-,0,1) [see, it&apos;s catching on!].  I think Schenker really remedied<br/>some of the shortfalls of the old-stock _stuffers_, and he has made lots of<br/>people look at tonal analysis in a new way...</p><p>Bye Joe!: Smiles and we&apos;re &quot;having fun&quot;  (hopefully!)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=8472 href="#8472">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Riemann categorized the &apos;secondary&apos;<br/>triads (II, III, and VI) in either of two categories precisely<br/>*because* of their mediant-relationships with the primary<br/>triads I, IV, V.  (The VII quite unproblematically represents<br/>an incomplete V.)  Thus, the explanation of III, for example,<br/>as representing either I or V, depending on context.  The same<br/>idea holds for II and VI.</p><p>Much of the recent elaboration on Riemann to which I alluded<br/>(Journal of Music Theory) has to do with analyzing mediant-<br/>relationships.</p><p>&gt; [Daniel Wolf]<br/>&gt; Already with such scholars as Tanaka (before the turn of the<br/>&gt; 20th century), tonal space was represented two dimensionally,<br/>&gt; in triangulated lattices.</p><p>In fact, Riemann&apos;s own _Tonnetz_ *was* a 2-D triangular lattice.<br/>I don&apos;t know if he got the idea from Tanaka (Riemann&apos;s _Tonnetz_<br/>appeared while Tanaka was living in Germany), or for that matter<br/>from someone else.  There&apos;s a dissertation available on microfilm<br/>(which I haven&apos;t been able to find but would *love* to read)<br/>by someone named Mooney, which covers the history of lattice<br/>diagrams in music, IIRC, or perhaps it&apos;s just the history of<br/>the development of the _Tonnetz_.</p><p>Anyway, I was under the impression that &apos;functional harmony&apos;<br/>had the specific meanings applied by Riemann and his followers,<br/>and didn&apos;t realize that so many people use it to simply be<br/>synonymous with &apos;common-practice harmony&apos;.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
