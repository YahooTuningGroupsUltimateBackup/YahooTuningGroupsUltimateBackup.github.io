I&apos;d like to canvas your opinions on why 7 notes seem to be just<br/>about &quot;enough&quot; to fill the range of an octave.</p><p>Although I&apos;m well aware of the many 5-note scales used by the world&apos;s<br/>different cultures, and have quite a bit of practice in creating and<br/>using scales of varying size, as needed, I&apos;m wondering if there may<br/>be some deep harmonic or timbral acoustical reason, or even a<br/>psychological reason why so many scales are around this size?</p><p>On the possibility of psychological limits, I believe the old theory<br/>about our short-term memory being able to handle 7, plus or minus 2,<br/>items of information has recently been discredited - or at least<br/>severely challenged.  But I can&apos;t quote a source for that information.</p><p>Perhaps we are more indoctrinated than we know by the constant<br/>barrage of common-practice music?</p><p>Over to you!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div>
