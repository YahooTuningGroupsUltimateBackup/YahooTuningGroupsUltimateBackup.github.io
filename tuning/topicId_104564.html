You need to<br/>input a bimonzo to get that, meaning &lt;&lt;bival|| \/ ||bimonzo&gt;&gt; will<br/>give you what you want.</p><p>One interpretation of this is that if you do &lt;&lt;bival|| \/ |2/1&gt;, you<br/>end up with a single &lt;val| remaining. Therefore, the &quot;number of notes&quot;<br/>in a bival with respect to 2/1 as period is actually a linear<br/>functional.</p><p>For instance, &lt;&lt;1 4 4|| \/ |1 0 0&gt; = &lt;0 1 4|. This is the &quot;number of<br/>notes per octave&quot; in meantone temperament. This is strange, but makes<br/>sense if you consider that there really is no answer to the question<br/>&quot;how many notes are in meantone, per octave?&quot; This is because it<br/>depends on what MOS you&apos;re using (if you&apos;re using an MOS at all), or<br/>how many generators you&apos;re using, or what have you.</p><p>This is what &lt;0 1 4| represents: a linear functional telling you how<br/>many notes are in meantone per octave if you input an additional<br/>monzo, which you can interpret as a &quot;chroma&quot; if you&apos;d like. Therefore,<br/>the &quot;number of notes in meantone per 2/1&quot; is a linear functional<br/>requiring another monzo to give you an answer.</p><p>You can also consider the result that you get if you put a bimonzo in<br/>directly. For instance &lt;&lt;1 4 4|| \/ ||1 0 0&gt; = 1, which tells you all<br/>of these things<br/>1) if 2/1 is a period, and 3/1 is the &quot;chroma,&quot; you get 1 note per octave.<br/>2) if 2/1 is a chroma, and 3/1 is the &quot;period,&quot; you get 1 note per octave.<br/>3) 2/1 and 3/1 are a pair of generators for meantone.<br/>4) if you go into the tempered meantone lattice, || |tempered 2/1&gt; ^<br/>|tempered 3/1&gt; ||  = 1.<br/>5) if you go into val space, and you take any pair of vals such that<br/>v1^v2 = &lt;&lt;1 4 4||, and you draw out the parallelogram with the origin<br/>and those two vals as vertices, and then you &quot;project&quot; this<br/>parallelogram onto the plane formed by the vals &lt;1 0 0| and &lt;0 1 0|,<br/>the area of the resulting parallelogram will be 1.</p><p>etc, but they&apos;re all subtly saying the same thing.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
