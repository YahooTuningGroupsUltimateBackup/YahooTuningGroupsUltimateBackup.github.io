Next tune E via 15:16 from F (use a<br/>temporary pure third F-A), E-B should now be &apos;tempered&apos; by 512/513. C<br/>can likewise be tuned via 16:15 from B (use a temporary pure third<br/>B-G) then F-C is also &apos;tempered&apos; by 512/513.</p><p>Now D is placed to temper G-D-A regularly, then G and A are themselves<br/>tempered to fill out C-G-D-A-E as a regular sequence. Finally G# is<br/>tempered between Eb and C#.</p><p>Try it for Mozart sonatas...</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2007 1:25:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Following the discussion of some weeks ago on the practical<br/>&gt; tunability of 19:15 relative to 81:64 (i.e. possible and<br/>&gt; possibly better), here are a couple of pseudo-historical<br/>&gt; circulating tunings with some 19-limit ratios.</p><p>Have you made Scala files for these?
