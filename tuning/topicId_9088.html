Lou&apos;s original idea<br/>&gt; was something like the followIng: a room would be filled with drawers,<br/>&gt; each containing a metallophone tuned to a particular mode.  The room<br/>&gt; would also contain tuneable harps or psalteries onto which one could<br/>&gt; transfer the tuning chosen. What might such a room look and sound<br/>&gt; like? To a certain extent, a program like Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s _Scala_<br/>&gt; and its extensive catalogue of scales serves this function, but I<br/>&gt; imagine that interface to the general public should be even<br/>&gt; friendlier.  The &quot;drawers&quot; could be graphic buttons on an html page,<br/>&gt; and opening each one would allow the viewer to read a description and<br/>&gt; history of the mode as well as hear the individual tones. Possibly<br/>&gt; samples of or links to real repertoire for the given mode might also<br/>&gt; be deposited in the drawer. What kind of sampling format(s) would be<br/>&gt; best for such a project? Perhaps midi and mp3? Does this idea interest<br/>&gt; anyone?

Each chest  would represent a<br/>cultural or historical grouping.  For example, one could be called<br/>&quot;Alexandria&quot; and would include all of the recorded Greek and Hellenistic<br/>tunings, each assigned to an individual drawer. Clicking on the individual<br/>drawer would open a page with a description and history of the tuning.  On<br/>the page would be some clickable graphic (lyre strings, aulos fingerholes,<br/>and metallophone bars come to mind) which would play individual tones.<br/>Perhaps important variations could be included on the same page -- for<br/>example: rotations of a tetrachord and both conjunct and disjunct scales<br/>built out of tetrachords.</p><p>I would be happy to generate sound samples, and I propose that they been<br/>available in mp3 format. Would eight seconds be an appropriate duration?<br/>What timbres should be used?  Should there be a standard tonic frequency?<br/>If there is, then the number of samples needed could be greatly reduced<br/>through sharing duplicated tones among the various modes. For &quot;Alexandria&quot;,<br/>something around &quot;d&quot; could be a suitable 1/1.</p><p>Are there volunteers out there who would like to serve as &quot;cabinetmakers&quot;,<br/>that is, to research the contents for individual chests-of-drawers?   I<br/>imagine having chests with such names as &quot;Alexandria&quot;, &quot;Bagdad&quot;,<br/>&quot;Liege&quot; (Margo Schulter, perhaps?), &quot;Madras&quot;, &quot;Mataram&quot;, &quot;Xi&apos;an&quot; etc.</p><p>Would anyone like to help out with graphics and html coding?</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p><p>&gt;This sounds like a good project for some of our students<br/>&gt;to do next year.

One thing<br/>we would need is Java to immediately play a tone of a given number of hertz<br/>in response to mouse clicks. Ideally, we would want to be able to have the<br/>decays overlap, so that &quot;strumming&quot; the psaltery (or whatever) would result<br/>in the notes strummed all sounding together. It would also be great to have<br/>a variety of timbres to choose from, possibly including samples. If they<br/>have already implemented JICalc, then it sounds like much of this is<br/>already done.</p><p>I can see several items in the drawer for each mode: a psaltery to play it,<br/>its tuning or variations, a historical/cultural discussion of the mode with<br/>a bibliography, links to similar modes, a discography, and example pieces<br/>or excerpts. Anything else?</p><p>Other things in the room itself: Lou&apos;s original UNESCO proposal, other<br/>appropriate &quot;items&quot; from Lou, a discussion about what a &quot;mode&quot; is, perhaps<br/>brief definitions of tuning and other terms used (or links to further<br/>discussion).</p><p>Until Lydia&apos;s students can begin work (or someone else does), I propose<br/>that we at least begin collecting the above information.
