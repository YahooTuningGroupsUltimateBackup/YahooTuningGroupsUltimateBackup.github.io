I&apos;ve tried many other ways, and would love to try more.</p><p>&gt;Mediant property has nothing<br/>&gt;to do with restriction modalities but only with fact of being Stern-Brocot<br/>&gt;subtrees.</p><p>Yes, Pierre, mediants seem to be the right thing to use no matter whether<br/>Farey or an alternative series is used. Please enlighten me -- this is why I<br/>contacted you in the first place!</p><p>&gt;Besides, with calculation depending of distance between ratios,<br/>&gt;jump to subsequent series results in few abrupt change in places.</p><p>Can you clarify? Do you mean changes in the distance between mediants?</p><p>&gt;For the sake of coherence it could be useful for particular calculation to<br/>&gt;use series of N-first [strata/layers/levels??] of Stern-Brocot tree.</p><p>hmm...</p><p>&gt;What<br/>&gt;is expecting ?</p><p>&gt;  - well-distributed changes from a series to the next</p><p>You mean changes in the distance between mediants?</p><p>&gt;As you know probably, by citation of Alex Bogomolny, I have soon<br/>&gt;demonstrated that Arithmetic Sum of simplicities on each layer is equal to<br/>&gt;1. This is equivalent to Harmonic Sum of complexities defined as 2^sonance<br/>&gt;or ab, in the case of reduced a/b. I recall what is Harmonic Sum :</p><p>&gt;   HS (a, b, c ...) = 1/(1/a + 1/b + 1/c ...)</p><p>&gt;If we attribute to each reduced ratio a/b of N-first layers series a weight<br/>&gt;equal to Nab then Harmonic Sum of those weights is equal to 1. I don&apos;t need<br/>&gt;to demonstrate that since it&apos;s almost an evidence.</p><p>PIERRE:<br/>*********************<br/>Can this be used to our advantage if we use a layer of the Stern-Brocot tree<br/>to calculate harmonic entropy???<br/>*********************</p><p>&gt;New fitted weights are defined at limits and vary only by factor N/N-1 when<br/>&gt;jumping to N.</p><p>Sounds promising . . . I guess I need to calculate these things myself and<br/>look at them . . .</p><p>&gt;I did&apos;nt read sufficiently on entropy theory to know if relevant as<br/>&gt;starting series. It seems only, at first glance, that it would be<br/>&gt;independant of subsequent physiological (and other) hypothesis by which<br/>&gt;smoothing and upper limitation of distribution could be obtained.</p><p>Yes! Yes! Yes!</p><p>I&apos;m gonna try using it for harmonic entropy instead of Farey series and see<br/>what comes out . . .</p><p>&gt;Besides, in the same<br/>&gt;spirit, I recall that &quot;lot of mathematics&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;most<br/>&gt;scientific&quot;.</p><p>That applies to dualism as well as everything else . . .</p></div>
