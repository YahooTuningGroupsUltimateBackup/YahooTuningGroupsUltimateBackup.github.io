I have a Martin 00016 with these magnetic<br/>interchangeable fingerboards. (By the way, I would attribute them to their<br/>inventor Tom Stone rather than to their current distributor Mark Rankin.) I<br/>have the action set fairly low, and it could easily be adjusted lower with<br/>the truss rod. The frets appear to be of standard height and shape (though<br/>they have no &quot;tang&quot; but rather are called &quot;Derby hat&quot; fret wire, with a wide<br/>flat bottom), so I do not see any inherent limitation on setting the action.<br/>As for removing the fingerboard, that is done by pushing to the side; it<br/>slides out under the strings. So that would not seem to be much affected by<br/>string height either, unless the strings are sitting right on the frets. Of<br/>course, all the different fingerboards must have the frets of the same<br/>height (though I have found that almost no filing is required).</p><p>David Canright                <a href="http://www.mbay.net/~anne/david/">http://www.mbay.net/~anne/david/</a></p></div>
