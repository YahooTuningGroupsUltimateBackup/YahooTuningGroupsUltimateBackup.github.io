Nearby<br/>schismic ets are 53, with a brat of 1.4273, 171 with a brat of<br/>0.63723, and 118 with a brat of 4.5724. I wonder if anyone would find a<br/>plot of brat vs fifth in cents for various temperaments interesting?</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/2003 10:01:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 07:05 PM 12/6/2003, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Carl wanted these, or at least I think that is what he was asking for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The meantone fifth with a brat of -1, the Wilson fifth, is the postive<br/>&gt;real root of f^4-2f-2=0.
