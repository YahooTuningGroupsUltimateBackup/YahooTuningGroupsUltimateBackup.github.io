Also, if you don&apos;t mind I&apos;ve changed the title - too<br/>many sightings of &apos;was Patrick Ozzard-Low&apos; in the past tense get a<br/>little disconcerting!  ;)</p><p>George wrote:</p><p>&gt;Patrick ...first contacted me (by phone, at what was around 3 a.m....<br/>&gt;This was also the event which first awakened me out of my microtonal<br/>&gt;slumber, so if you happen to read this, thank you Patrick!)</p><p>My pleasure!  anyone who wants to ring me at 3 am - just count to ten<br/>and wait till tomorrow!  ;)  Oh, except it almost 3 am now...  Thanks<br/>George - I&apos;m very glad indeed I made that call!</p><p>Now seriously, about these microtonal woodwinds, brasswinds, extended<br/>techniques... I&apos;ll try to put my view on this as clearly as I can.<br/>You&apos;ll see that I&apos;m not taking sides.  Many truths have been expressed<br/>on the list about this recently - apparently in contradiction - but I<br/>think that in reality they complement each other.  Here goes (apologies<br/>for length):</p><p>Firstly, I think its worth taking Johnny&apos;s position on this seriously,<br/>not only because there&apos;s more than a grain of truth in what he says, but<br/>because there are quite a significant and now increasing number of<br/>players who specialise in performing contemporary music, in Europe, USA<br/>and elswhere, who ARE indeed capable of playing mainly quarter-tones but<br/>also (as in Johnny&apos;s group) other tuning systems too.  Of course the<br/>overall accuracy of performance amongst these groups (considering pitch<br/>alone) varies, but as has been said, 1/4-tone realisation (for example)<br/>is seldom intended to be especially &apos;strict&apos; (in a mathematical sense),<br/>since composers and performers are more concerned with being &apos;in-tune&apos;,<br/>and that depends greatly on musical context, and these factors, taken<br/>together, are not easily correlatable or quantifiable.  In my opinion,<br/>for example, being &apos;in-tune&apos; is not reducible (even vertically, moment<br/>by moment, which to my mind is not a sufficent criterion) to analysis in<br/>terms of &apos;pure&apos; (JI) tunings, because what counts as &apos;in-tune&apos; results<br/>from both acoustic and &apos;encultured&apos; phenomena.</p><p>Anyway... one amongst quite a number of groups who achieve pretty<br/>&apos;accurate&apos; performances (in the above sense), is James Wood&apos;s UK based<br/>ensemble &apos;Critical Band&apos;.  At the recent CNMI symposium their<br/>clarinettist, Ian Mitchell, was present.  He commented at one stage that<br/>making 1/4-tone (or n-tone) instruments was unnecessary, and would &apos;take<br/>the fun out of playing 1/4 music&apos; (which Ian can sight-read while eating<br/>breakfast, reading the newspaper, and cycling to work).  I countered<br/>that, were 1/4-tone instruments available, the players could still have<br/>their &apos;fun&apos; playing 1/8-tones - or whatever.  And I think he gently<br/>concurred...</p><p>But this misses a more fundamental point which I think Johnny (and many<br/>others) have raised, which is that wind instruments aren&apos;t played &apos;in-<br/>tune&apos; just by pressing keys etc.  Rather, it is the intentionality of<br/>the performer, honed by years of experience, which really does the job.<br/>Once the player has as tuning in their mind&apos;s ear (or ear&apos;s mind), for<br/>the good player tuning, given the right (non-standard by conventional<br/>standards) combinations of fingerings, embouchure and breath-control are<br/>second nature, and come quite naturally...</p><p>As I tried to say in the book (despite it&apos;s three billion blemishes<br/>which I now see...) this must be recognised as part-and-parcel of all<br/>wind (wood and brass) playing.</p><p>Now the thing is - when George writes, very compellingly, that -</p><p>&gt;&gt;If microtonality is going to be so difficult to achieve that<br/>&gt;&gt;it is going to be beyond the reach of all but an elite group, then<br/>&gt;&gt;there is no chance of its becoming a part of the musical mainstream,<br/>&gt;&gt;achievable by unexceptional amateur musicians, and it will be doomed<br/>&gt;&gt;to remain a very small niche in the world of music.</p><p>&gt;&gt;This, I submit, is the compelling reason for the creation of<br/>&gt;&gt;microtonal instruments.</p><p>- I am in considerable degree of agreement with him.  But there is also<br/>a compelling counter-argument, which is that if tuning largely depends<br/>on the intentionality of the performer, no matter how many logically<br/>controlled tone-holes the instrument has, if the performer ain&apos;t doing<br/>the intentionality thing it ain&apos;t gonna sound in tune anyhow.</p><p>Johnny&apos;s other point is that it isn&apos;t _that_ difficult, once you get<br/>into it (and if you&apos;re already an excellent player).  (Johnny&apos;s<br/>perspective is slightly biased by the fact that the bassoon is the least<br/>&apos;in-tune&apos; of the orchestral winds - if, for example, comparison were<br/>made by blowing them all mechanically.  Because the learner bassoonist<br/>has to play _against_ the &apos;natural&apos; tuning of the instrument right from<br/>the start, playing &apos;alternative&apos; tunings is not so counter-intuitive as<br/>on other winds.  Or so I understand).</p><p>[Another point worth bearing in mind regarding tuning on woodwinds is<br/>that (again, as I understand it, from Leo Fuks) the player is constantly<br/>compensating for the changes in gas composition as the player blows out<br/>(the make-up of gas changes significantly with time).  Without<br/>compensation, on a longish note, the pitch of a note falls by up-to<br/>about 20 cents.  So I take a the pinch of salt when players talk about<br/>achieving accuracy (constant through start-time 0 and throughout the<br/>compensation process) of &apos;one cent&apos;.  Johnny, did you ever get one of<br/>your friends round to do 100% objective tests on intonation - with a<br/>good (say Peterson) pitch meter? Not that it really makes any<br/>difference...]</p><p>Anyway...  the counter-counter-argument goes: player&apos;s will have a<br/>better chance of learning and refining the tuning if the process of<br/>learning to play a new instrument itself refines the process of the<br/>&apos;intentional&apos; learning: in short, that the new instrument will generate<br/>a new degree of sensitivity and reactivity in the _player_.</p><p>So things are really upside down to conventional thinking: the most<br/>important thing about any musical instrument is the person who&apos;s playing<br/>it.  And the &apos;person&apos; who teaches the player to play is... to some<br/>extent... the instrument.</p><p>A counter-counter-counter-argument is: really good players have refined<br/>tuning anyway.  When the Berlin Phil play Messaien do you say: &apos;hey, I<br/>wish they would play better in tune&apos;?  Occasionally perhaps - but 99.99%<br/>of the time questions of tuning don&apos;t enter your head: its wonderful<br/>music.  So we don&apos;t need any further tuning refinement.</p><p>But counter-counter-etc is: that is not so, generally, with<br/>microtonality.  Most listeners regularly ask themselves when listening<br/>to such music: &apos;I wonder if I&apos;m really hearing what the composer<br/>intended&apos;.  New instruments (ones which really worked) could greatly<br/>help, I believe, focus complex melody and harmony.  (For simple<br/>microtonal harmony the need for new instrument may be less.)</p><p>However, there again, simple or slow music may call for the greatest<br/>uniformity of tone throughout the scale, and that is categorically NOT<br/>available on existing instruments if non-standard tunings are required.</p><p>And so, all in all...I still believe passionately that we need new<br/>acoustic instruments.</p><p>George also wrote:</p><p>&gt; Patrick reports that this<br/>&gt;sort of technology has already been tested (to a limit extent), and<br/>&gt;it has elicited some very favorable reactions from the players<br/>&gt;involved.</p><p>Just to be 100% clear: very favourable from a excellent trumpet player,<br/>Steve Altoft.  We don&apos;t unfortunately have any reports on radical<br/>microtonal wind instruments yet.</p><p>George also wrote:</p><p>&gt;I also mentioned brass instruments.  Within the past couple of years<br/>&gt;I completely rethought my original brass proposal and discarded it in<br/>&gt;favor of a completely new approach that does the same thing for the<br/>&gt;brass instruments that the Bosanquet keyboard could do for<br/>&gt;synthesizers (and did for the Scalatron) or that the sagittal symbols<br/>&gt;can do for notation: My new approach employs easy-to-learn fingerings<br/>&gt;that partially build on existing (12-EDO) patterns and carry over<br/>&gt;from one tonal system to another.  This can be implemented in multi-<br/>&gt;system brass instruments that would allow a player to have 17, 19,<br/>&gt;22, 24, 31, 36, and 41-EDO (and perhaps others) all in a single four-<br/>&gt;valve instrument.  I need to emphasize that these are not<br/>&gt;hypothetical instruments; I&apos;ve done the math on the tube lengths, and<br/>&gt;it can all be done with mechanical valves.  (Patrick has been<br/>&gt;pursuing the use of electrically controlled valves lately, and if<br/>&gt;that will offer any significant advantage in cost or reliability,<br/>&gt;then that could be a  possibility.)</p><p>I think what George has done here is very remarkable.  Unfortunately I<br/>have still not been able to persuade our brass instrument maker (Dave<br/>Cowie) to examine closely what George has done, partly because Dave is<br/>no mathematician, partly because he&apos;s got his own ideas of how he wants<br/>HIS brass quintet to work (and I can&apos;t argue with that!).  However, I&apos;m<br/>working on it...</p><p>&gt;With a multi-system instrument the player would not be locked into a<br/>&gt;single tonal system upon making a purchase, would not incur any<br/>&gt;adverse financial consequences upon a change of mind about that<br/>&gt;system, and would not have to carry more than one instrument to a<br/>&gt;performance to play in different systems.  Likewise, the manufacturer<br/>&gt;would not have to produce separate models for different tonal systems<br/>&gt;(as if that would happen anyway!), thus giving the convertible<br/>&gt;instruments the widest possible market, i.e., the entire microtonal<br/>&gt;community (which is small enough as things go).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Does this sound like the sort of &quot;standard&quot; that might appeal to you<br/>&gt;or anybody else out there?</p><p>I _have_ been talking (very very very tentatively) to a major UK<br/>ensemble/orchestra about them taking up some microtonal brass<br/>instruments for a demonstration...  Further details as things progress,<br/>I guess in about 25 years or so ;) ...</p><p>&gt;Both Patrick and Harry Partch gave the same answer to this question.<br/>&gt;The one (and probably only) thing that is going to put microtonality<br/>&gt;in demand is to have some significant microtonal music come into<br/>&gt;existence.  Whether it might be the sort of instant success that<br/>&gt;would accomplish what &quot;Switch-on Bach&quot; did for electronic music, or<br/>&gt;whether it would more likely be a significant cumulative body of work<br/>&gt;of a group of talented people, it&apos;s ultimately up to those of us who<br/>&gt;consider ourselves microtonal composers to compose something<br/>&gt;significant.  Short of that, I don&apos;t think we have a prayer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A primary purpose of the paper is to secure funding for what is<br/>&gt;admittedly a highly ambitious project, and in endeavoring to convey a<br/>&gt;vision of what should be the future of music, I think that Patrick<br/>&gt;felt that it was useful to show that musical tuning has a varied and<br/>&gt;illustrious past.  What we are using today has been in general use<br/>&gt;for a relatively short time; and what we will use in the future does<br/>&gt;not have to be what we are using today.</p><p>Thank you George for these incisive summaries!</p><p>Paul wrote:</p><p>&gt;i&apos;m surprised to hear you say that, given the imaginative mechanisms<br/>&gt;you&apos;ve proposed for new wind and brass instruments. it seems that 72<br/>&gt;would be far more practical, since one could preserve a musician&apos;s<br/>&gt;lifetime of training in 12-equal, and then use the electronic keying<br/>&gt;technology to provide a way, with just a couple of extra buttons, to<br/>&gt;inflect by a twelfth-tone, by a sixth-tone, and by a quarter-tone.<br/>&gt;and you&apos;re done!</p><p>Thanks Paul.  On a woodwind this kind of thing may well be possible,<br/>assuming, as George later pointed out, you&apos;ve got three extra fingers!<br/>But seriously, of course it&apos;s possible to reduce the number of keys<br/>required to do the jobs by simple combinative logic.  But the major<br/>problems are acoustics and interface (if the instr is an extension of<br/>the conventional design):</p><p>- the number of tone-holes used, and the the acoustic damage of having a<br/>large number of &apos;chimneys&apos; and an increase of multiple inner-<br/>enlargements within the bore itself; and the design of an optimal and<br/>playable (cognizable) arrangement of finger movements which are not<br/>necessarily biased toward particular (conventional) pitch arrangements<br/>and figurations.  There are so _many_ ways of solving the latter problem<br/>(each with plusses and minuses) that choosing which one (or ones) to<br/>prototype is the first problem...</p><p>Joseph (I think!) wrote:</p><p>&gt;*YES!*  Or even, possibly, with *conventional* fingerings and a *FOOT<br/>&gt;PEDAL* or some such to affect the three &quot;inflections!&quot;</p><p>IRCAM have developed a foot-pedal for the conventional clarinet.  If you<br/>buy any of Alain Damiens recent recordings he is likely to be using<br/>this.  Basically, it&apos;s something like a MIDI-keyboard-sustain pedal<br/>which attaches via a bicycle cable to a small piston which rides inside<br/>a horizontal cylinder - a &apos;branch-tube&apos; - on the side of the mouth-<br/>piece, just forward from the reed.  When you press the pedal down it<br/>pulls the piston outward, thus increasing the volume of air inside the<br/>mouthpiece - and the pitch falls.  Of course the amount the pitch falls<br/>varies proportionally to the number of toneholes which are closed.  So<br/>its not a &apos;discreet&apos; &apos;scale-forming&apos; device - its a slide, operating<br/>within about a tone.  Unfortunately the device also affects the timbre<br/>of the note - but this can be used to goo effect too, if that&apos;s what the<br/>composer wants.</p><p>That&apos;s all I can manage now (and its 4.00 am) and fingers are going.<br/>There&apos;s a book of this stuff in my head and I&apos;d be here until tommorrow<br/>at 4am.</p><p>George - I&apos;ve seen the woodwind stuff and will reply when possible.</p><p>Aaron (pitchcolor!) if you&apos;re reading this, I recieved the new diagram -<br/>thanks - back to you later!</p><p>Hope this is useful -</p><p>cheers for now,</p><p>Patrick</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2002 6:59:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Patrick Ozzard-Low &lt;pol@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/33911">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/33911</a></p><p>&gt; IRCAM have developed a foot-pedal for the conventional clarinet.<br/>If you buy any of Alain Damiens recent recordings he is likely to be<br/>using this.

Your are quite correct in your<br/>summations (in my estimation).  The bias you mention was quite sensitive on<br/>your part.  Of course, the bassoon, by being so &quot;not-press-and-blow&quot; leads<br/>this bassoon-biased musician to conclude that the other woodwinds could do<br/>more than they do to play in tune.</p><p>Regarding embouchure (the position or application of the lips and tongue in<br/>playing a wind instrument).  There is wind velocity, embouchure (direction,<br/>embouchure pressures on the reed or mouthpiece, glottis dropping, angle of<br/>the reed or mouthpiece, leanings on keys for further venting or depressing of<br/>keys, fine tuning of the instrument before playing (by bending keys, adding<br/>tape to holes for extensions, different size bocals and barrels) and of<br/>course different makings of reeds.  Then there is the humidity, the space<br/>(and how filled in it is with people), the mental feeling of the player (sad,<br/>excited, new to the group and shy, audience reception perceived); all these<br/>relate.</p><p>As Patrick said, any exact measurement of consonance as a slice in time<br/>proves nothing since it does not demonstrate the mental intention of the<br/>player.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
