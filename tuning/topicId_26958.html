Fact is, we really don&apos;t know just how Bach tuned, end of story. We can read about the times he lived in, and what has been written about that time period, etc...and then, of course, we can try to draw intelligent conclusions. From what I&apos;ve studied, it looks like well temps, meantone, and eq temps were all in use at that time, and there was a lot of experimenting and tweaking of keyboard tunings constantly being tried.<br/>    It wouldn&apos;t surprise me at all if Bach used well temps; especially since the Well Tempered Clavier is, apparently, named in regards to the tuning used. It also wouldn&apos;t surprise me if he also used equal temperament...it may not have been that big a deal to him...especially as he is known to have played with Sylvius Weiss, the great lutenist, written or adapted a number of works for the lute, and was known to have had a clavier that sounded like a lute. Of course, lutes were in 12 eq.<br/>   And, here&apos;s a quote I found from &quot;The New Bach Reader&quot; (P8): &quot;In his later years he was persuaded to become a member of the Society of Musical Sciences, which had been founded by one of his lesser pupils, but his contributions consisted exclusively of music, and Carl Philipp Emanuel expressly stated-referring to the discussions of proportions and temperament of which certain contemporaries were particularly fond-that &quot;he never was a friend of dry, mathematical stuff.&quot;<br/>   And, this is just my opinion, and will hopefully be taken with a bit of humor...I am of the opinion that Bach was, perhaps, less concerned about what tuning he used than many of the folks who are debating the issue. At heart, he was deeply concerned with creating beautiful and profound music; and, as a professional, working musician, we was also very practical, I believe, as he had to constantly be writing music for the various churches he oversaw, and the many freelance gigs he played. Again, we&apos;ll never know for sure how committed he was to one system or the other, unless, some day, we discover writings that explicitly talk about it. And until then, the debate will carry on, and provide us tuning folks with hours of entertainment...best...HHH<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>  <a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=67976 href="#67976">ðŸ”—</a>kevin ryan &#x3C;bentivi_cdo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/13/2006 7:39:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>All of this debate over Bach&apos;s tuning reminded me of<br/>this research that drew my skepticism when I read it<br/>in college:<br/><a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0014-1836(197901)23%3A1%3C57%3ATNPAS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-F">http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0014-1836(197901)23%3A1%3C57%3ATNPAS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-F</a><br/>The textbook for a Physics of Sound class I took cited<br/>it as an example of a cultural tuning system that was<br/>not logarithmic...<br/>I don&apos;t have a lot of knowledge about data analysis,<br/>but it seemed like Haeberli jumped to conclusions.

From what I&apos;ve studied, it looks<br/>&gt; like<br/>&gt;   &gt; well temps, meantone, and eq temps were all in<br/>&gt; use<br/>&gt;   &gt; at that time, and there was a lot of<br/>&gt; experimenting<br/>&gt;   &gt; and tweaking of keyboard tunings constantly<br/>&gt; being<br/>&gt;   &gt; tried.<br/>&gt;   &gt; It wouldn&apos;t surprise me at all if Bach used well<br/>&gt;   &gt; temps; especially since the Well Tempered<br/>&gt; Clavier<br/>&gt;   &gt; is, apparently, named in regards to the tuning<br/>&gt; used.<br/>&gt;   &gt; It also wouldn&apos;t surprise me if he also used<br/>&gt; equal<br/>&gt;   &gt; temperament...it may not have been that big a<br/>&gt; deal<br/>&gt;   &gt; to him...especially as he is known to have<br/>&gt; played<br/>&gt;   &gt; with Sylvius Weiss, the great lutenist, written<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt;   &gt; adapted a number of works for the lute, and was<br/>&gt;   &gt; known to have had a clavier that sounded like a<br/>&gt;   &gt; lute. Of course, lutes were in 12 eq.<br/>&gt;   &gt; And, here&apos;s a quote I found from &quot;The New Bach<br/>&gt;   &gt; Reader&quot; (P8): &quot;In his later years he was<br/>&gt; persuaded<br/>&gt;   &gt; to become a member of the Society of Musical<br/>&gt;   &gt; Sciences, which had been founded by one of his<br/>&gt;   &gt; lesser pupils, but his contributions consisted<br/>&gt;   &gt; exclusively of music, and Carl Philipp Emanuel<br/>&gt;   &gt; expressly stated-referring to the discussions of<br/>&gt;   &gt; proportions and temperament of which certain<br/>&gt;   &gt; contemporaries were particularly fond-that &quot;he<br/>&gt; never<br/>&gt;   &gt; was a friend of dry, mathematical stuff.&quot;<br/>&gt;   &gt; And, this is just my opinion, and will hopefully<br/>&gt;   &gt; be taken with a bit of humor...I am of the<br/>&gt; opinion<br/>&gt;   &gt; that Bach was, perhaps, less concerned about<br/>&gt; what<br/>&gt;   &gt; tuning he used than many of the folks who are<br/>&gt;   &gt; debating the issue. At heart, he was deeply<br/>&gt;   &gt; concerned with creating beautiful and profound<br/>&gt;   &gt; music; and, as a professional, working musician,<br/>&gt; we<br/>&gt;   &gt; was also very practical, I believe, as he had to<br/>&gt;   &gt; constantly be writing music for the various<br/>&gt; churches<br/>&gt;   &gt; he oversaw, and the many freelance gigs he<br/>&gt; played.<br/>&gt;   &gt; Again, we&apos;ll never know for sure how committed<br/>&gt; he<br/>&gt;   &gt; was to one system or the other, unless, some<br/>&gt; day, we<br/>&gt;   &gt; discover writings that explicitly talk about it.<br/>&gt; And<br/>&gt;   &gt; until then, the debate will carry on, and<br/>&gt; provide us<br/>&gt;   &gt; tuning folks with hours of<br/>&gt;   &gt; entertainment...best...HHH<br/>&gt;   &gt; <a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a> <a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>__________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;   Sponsored Link<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Try Netflix today!
