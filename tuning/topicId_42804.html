While many people use (and develop) wavetable instruments, there is still a large group of instruments known as samplers, even in software. For instance:</p><p><a href="http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?id=samplingline_us">http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?id=samplingline_us</a></p><p>Note that they refer to the entire line as &quot;software samplers&quot;. I know people that use samplers *as* samplers, not as some kind of synthesis, and I bet you do as well. No rubric here.</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t answer a question I don&apos;t understand.</p><p>I usually don&apos;t try to; if I don&apos;t know, I at least ask before assuming they wanted something else.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=42818 href="#42818">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/2003 6:06:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;A.

He obviously wants something that can<br/>play back, which would be called a synth in most circles.  If<br/>he wants it also to record, that&apos;s one thing.
