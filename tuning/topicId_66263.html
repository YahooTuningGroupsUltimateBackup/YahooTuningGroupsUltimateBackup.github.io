He was, afterall,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an impressive fellow.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; He&apos;s great in the sense that we know his name 400 years later,<br/>&gt; &gt; no doubt greater than most of his contemporaries whose names<br/>&gt; &gt; we don&apos;t know, but among those we do, he&apos;s not among my favorites.</p><p>To be clear: Richard Egarr&apos;s remark on that radio show was about *Louis* Couperin, not Francois.</p><p>&gt;Unfortunately, I think the Lehman approach sets back Bach &gt;scholarship, as well as early music in the tuning that gives that &gt;extra zing to a composer.</p><p>Do you even know what &quot;the Lehman approach&quot; is?  Ever come to any of my concerts, or pick up any of the CDs?  When I play a gig  that works completely in meantone (or similar), or otherwise closely segregated repertoire, I still use temperaments that as closely match that repertoire as possible.  My practice in this hasn&apos;t changed in 20 years of doing this; I just have an additional option now, when the concert also happens to include the Bachs or other composers who need something very smoothly circulating.</p><p>Like, for example, this concert from last autumn that had a trek through all 24 keys:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/2005nov21.htm">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/2005nov21.htm</a></p><p>Meanwhile, I keep one of my harpsichords here in various regular meantones almost all the time, and do some of my practicing regularly on that....especially in 16th and early 17th century music.</p><p>&gt;Some composers really lose out when played in equal (Buxtehude, &gt;Telemann) while others can be played in almost anything (like Bach &gt;-- although he sounds awful in just).</p><p>Have you actually played through all, or even a significant percentage, of the Bach test pieces I have listed at<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/testpieces.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/testpieces.html</a><br/>?  Sure, Bach&apos;s music &quot;can be played&quot; in tunings that make rough sounds (like Werckmeister III which isn&apos;t even for harpsichords at all!); and quite a few fine musicians still do so.  But, that alone doesn&apos;t constitute an argument that it *should* be.</p><p>Why should Bach&apos;s music be constrained to make rough/ugly sounds, as if that feature (alone) suddenly confers some extra degree of authenticity to it?  How?</p><p>And I agree with you that Buxtehude and Telemann sound lousy in equal; so does Bach, IMO.  Dull and colorless.</p><p>&gt;Not incidentally, the AFMM is present Joshua Pierce in the Duetto #2 &gt;by Bach in Werckmeister III since Brad declared it the killer piece &gt;to determine Bach was not in WIII.  Sounds great to us!</p><p>And you *like* those clashes that come up, especially in bars 74-105 when using W-III?  Listening at a variety of tempos, and a variety of distances from the instrument?  *Playing* the instrument with your head right there by the soundboard?</p><p>To W-III&apos;s credit, it sounds a lot less hellish in that passage than regular meantones (and variants) do.  But still, all those spots in W-III where the bass is more than 81/80 too low for the center of the harmony...ugh!  This Duetto lays them right out there, naked as major 10ths and 17ths: Db-F and Ab-C especially.</p><p>&gt;Of course Bach sounds awful in just intonation. He implicitely assumes<br/>&gt;that 81/80 is tempered out all over the place.</p><p>And there&apos;s the famous remark by Sorge, also, that Bach despised intervals that were 81/80 or more out of tune.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
