This performance at the Oddmusic Convergence used the same tuning (19 ET), equipment and software as GR-20 Hexaphonic 19-ET Guitar Improvisation with the exception that Session Drummer 3 was added.</p><p>Using that video and the original midi I combined video effects plus the output of &quot;Marktxt&quot; to the original performance</p><p>I applied that program to a large number of lyrics by Evan Harrington and myself and used the output as the basis of the text<br/>in this video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ROb89b1Cr4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ROb89b1Cr4</a></p><p>All of the media associated with this project is here:<br/><a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/19-ET/oddmusic_convergence_20091214/">http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/19-ET/oddmusic_convergence_20091214/</a></p><p>including the high quality version of the video (230 megs)<br/><a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/19-ET/oddmusic_convergence_20091214/performance-enhanced.wmv">http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/19-ET/oddmusic_convergence_20091214/performance-enhanced.wmv</a></p><p>Details can be found on my blog post <a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=68">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=68</a></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Chris</p></div><h3><a id=85911 href="#85911">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2010 1:39:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris,</p><p>&gt; I applied that program to a large number of lyrics by Evan Harrington and myself and used the output as the basis of the text<br/>&gt; in this video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ROb89b1Cr4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ROb89b1Cr4</a></p><p>Nicely done, both the original performance and all the post-production enhancement.

I am still<br/>exploring the potential of this technology.<br/>It does offer a unique advantage since I can control independently on the<br/>basis of each string.</p><p>Thank you for the view and comment!</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Thu, Jan 28, 2010 at 4:39 PM, jonszanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I applied that program to a large number of lyrics by Evan Harrington and<br/>&gt; myself and used the output as the basis of the text<br/>&gt; &gt; in this video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ROb89b1Cr4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ROb89b1Cr4</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nicely done, both the original performance and all the post-production<br/>&gt; enhancement.
