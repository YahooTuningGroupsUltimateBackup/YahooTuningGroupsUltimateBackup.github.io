Since 1 key to the right is a major 2nd, then this amounts to six major 2nds up.  Going up six major 2nds in 17, 19, 22, 31, meantone, pythagorean, or anything else that&apos;s not 12 does not take you up an octave; you would have to go right 6 keys and down 2 rows to get to the octave.  For any EDO, the octave will also be available in another row (assuming that there are a sufficient number of rows), but its location will vary according to the number of tones/octave: for 17 go up 3 rows and move to the left (the key to the left of the crack); for 19 go up 3 rows and move to the right; for 22 go up 4 rows and 1 key to the left; for 31 go up 5 rows and move to the right.  This sort of adjustment will be necessary if you&apos;re going much more than an octave away from the region around middle C.  In other words, the keys 2 octaves above and below middle C will be in different locations with different numbers of tones/octave.</p><p>I was wondering whether my failure to communicate my point is because we have different definitions of the term &quot;generalized&quot;.  As Bosanquet conceived the first generalilzed keyboard, it is not enough for a keyboard to have transpositional invariance (and I think I&apos;m correct in assuming that you will want to map the pitches of whatever tuning with transpositional invariance).  It must also have fingering patterns in common across multiple tunings over the entire range of the keyboard, insofar as those tunings will allow.</p><p>There are instances where the fingerings for certain intervals cannot be the same for different tunings, for example, the best approximation of 4:5 in 19-ET vs. 22-ET occurs at different locations in a chain of fifths, so that this interval *must* be played differently on Bosanquet&apos;s keyboard.  However, octaves, fourths, fifths, and major 2nds, and combinations thereof, are all played alike in those two tunings, so the fingering patterns for those intervals are generalized across those tunings.

I would advise keeping the keyboard as is and using a few stick-ons to mark the C&apos;s for other tunings.  You would be playing mostly by vectors and patterns anyway (i.e., more by touch than by sight), so the color disorientation would be a problem mostly in instances where you have to move your entire hand to make a large jump in pitch.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Colored tape is also a possibility, though admittedly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not ideal.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Kraig also observed, if you use a conventional right-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand fingering for a C major scale (thumbs on C &amp; F, which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also *does* maintain a meaningful color pattern, up to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a point), then your&apos;re going to move diagonally off the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; edge of the keyboard,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Erv mentioned this to me as a disadvantage of the Fokker<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; organ vs. Bosanquet&apos;s, in 1998.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Another disadvantage of the Fokker keyboard is that it isn&apos;t generalized, because the key colors are not consistent with tunings having other than 31 tones/octave.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; BTW, per a recent message, I saw that Kraig is under the mistaken impression that I came up with the Scalatron generalized keyboard completely from scratch.  I already knew about the Fokker keyboard, and I thought that it could be improved by: 1) reversing the order of the rows by mentally flipping it over along the x-axis, and 2) slanting the rows so that octaves of the same pitch were exactly lateral.  Only afterward did I realize that the result would accommodate any tuning that could be mapped to a single chain of 5ths.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I brought it up with Paul<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in 2001 and he demonstrated a fingering using 3 rows that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t have this problem and which he claims is superior<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway.

For any EDO, the octave will also be available in another row (assuming that there are a sufficient number of rows), but its location will vary according to the number of tones/octave: for 17 go up 3 rows and move to the left (the key to the left of the crack); for 19 go up 3 rows and move to the right; for 22 go up 4 rows and 1 key to the left; for 31 go up 5 rows and move to the right.

I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t checked the arithmetic, but it looks like his<br/>&gt; &quot;order 2 class 1&quot; defines diaschismic temperament.

Order 2 systems really demand<br/>&gt; a different keyboard, and Bosanquet showed this.  The<br/>&gt; diagram is on p. 382.  The later description specified c &grave;e<br/>&gt; g as a major third, so the note names must be Pythagorean.<br/>&gt; You can see that the whole tones like c-d, which will<br/>&gt; approximate 9:8, appear to be divided into two equal<br/>&gt; semitones.  This is a property of order 2 systems that is<br/>&gt; not reflected on a first order keyboard.  Bosanquet was<br/>&gt; right on the money.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve read Bosanquet&apos;s 1876 &quot;Elementary Treatise on<br/>&gt; &gt; Musical Intervals and Temperament&quot;, in which he doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; even mention the 22 division, although I understand he<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote about 22 later on.

This is the same keyboard geometry as the pajara keyboard diagrams I referred to in my previous message:<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/94614">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/94614</a></p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see any mention of Pythagorean intonation.  I<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t checked the arithmetic, but it looks like his<br/>&gt; &quot;order 2 class 1&quot; defines diaschismic temperament.  So<br/>&gt; closely that I&apos;ll propose re-naming &quot;Diaschismic&quot; as<br/>&gt; &quot;Bosanquet&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to take your word for it, because I haven&apos;t yet read the paper.  I only had time to look at the keyboard diagram, which instantly showed me that it&apos;s essentially a pajara keyboard.  The vertically aligned keys in my diagrams are different from Bosanquet&apos;s; mine differ by 1 degree of 34 and 56 and are duplicates in 22.</p><p>&gt; A first order keyboard does not work with these tunings.<br/>&gt; 22-equal can be treated as first-order, but remember your<br/>&gt; second criterion for a generalized keyboard:  &quot;It must also<br/>&gt; have fingering patterns in common across multiple tunings<br/>&gt; over the entire range of the keyboard, insofar as those<br/>&gt; tunings will allow.&quot;</p><p>The original generalized keyboard will work with second-order tunings that have all the tones in a single chain of 5ths, in other words, about 1/2 of them.  Thus 22 and 46 will work, but 34 and 58 won&apos;t.  This keyboard will also work with 56 (probably the optimal division for pajara), which is third-order.</p><p>&gt; The fingering pattern for 22 will not<br/>&gt; be shared correctly with 46.  Order 2 systems really demand<br/>&gt; a different keyboard, and Bosanquet showed this.  The<br/>&gt; diagram is on p. 382.  The later description specified c &grave;e<br/>&gt; g as a major third, so the note names must be Pythagorean.<br/>&gt; You can see that the whole tones like c-d, which will<br/>&gt; approximate 9:8, appear to be divided into two equal<br/>&gt; semitones.  This is a property of order 2 systems that is<br/>&gt; not reflected on a first order keyboard.  Bosanquet was<br/>&gt; right on the money.</p><p>I don&apos;t think he got it exactly right.  The suitability of the keyboard depends on the number of chains of fifths, not on the order of the division (as Bosanquet defined it).</p><p>Furthermore, on the first-order keyboard the positive first-order divisions don&apos;t have primes 5, 7, and 11 mapped the same way as the negative first-order divisions (yet this doesn&apos;t disqualify the keyboard from being generalized).  It&apos;s all a matter of &quot;insofar as the tunings allow it.&quot;  If you wanted 31 and 41 to have all the primes mapped the same way, you&apos;d need a decimal (Miracle) keyboard, which would also cover 72.  (The decimal keyboard will also accommodate 19 and 53, but the mapping of most of the primes is quite different.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve read Bosanquet&apos;s 1876 &quot;Elementary Treatise on<br/>&gt; &gt; Musical Intervals and Temperament&quot;, in which he doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; even mention the 22 division, although I understand he<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote about 22 later on.  The generalized keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; described in his 1876 treatise will work just fine with<br/>&gt; &gt; any tuning mapped to 22 tones in a chain of 5ths (I know<br/>&gt; &gt; so, because I&apos;ve used 22-equal many times on my<br/>&gt; &gt; Scalatron), so I don&apos;t really understand your question,<br/>&gt; &gt; because there&apos;s no need for a different keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course it works with a chain of fifths, because the<br/>&gt; keyboard is based on a chain of fifths.  It doesn&apos;t work<br/>&gt; with tunings that have two distinct chains of fifths.  It<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t work at all for 34, does it?</p><p>No, it doesn&apos;t.  Chains of fifths, not Bosanquet-order, is what determines the suitability of the keyboard.</p><p>No one keyboard will do it all, but Bosanquet&apos;s original generalized keyboard does more than any other.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2010 2:56:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi George,</p><p>&gt; Only the 3-limit consonances will map alike for 22, 41, and 31<br/>&gt; (comparing doubly-positive 22 with typical divisions that are<br/>&gt; singly positive and singly negative, respectively)</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; But the Bosanquet keyboard is still generalized *insofar* as<br/>&gt; the tunings permit the same fingerings, and the octaves in 22<br/>&gt; are still exactly lateral.</p><p>Fingerings for... the chain of 5ths, but not much else.</p><p>&gt; My point is that Bosanquet&apos;s original generalized keyboard<br/>&gt; works just fine for 22; you merely have to learn different<br/>&gt; locations for primes 5, 7, and 11.

Thus 22 and 46 will work, but 34 and 58 won&apos;t.  This keyboard will also work with 56 (probably the optimal division for pajara), which is third-order.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The fingering pattern for 22 will not<br/>&gt; &gt; be shared correctly with 46.  Order 2 systems really demand<br/>&gt; &gt; a different keyboard, and Bosanquet showed this.  The<br/>&gt; &gt; diagram is on p. 382.  The later description specified c &grave;e<br/>&gt; &gt; g as a major third, so the note names must be Pythagorean.<br/>&gt; &gt; You can see that the whole tones like c-d, which will<br/>&gt; &gt; approximate 9:8, appear to be divided into two equal<br/>&gt; &gt; semitones.  This is a property of order 2 systems that is<br/>&gt; &gt; not reflected on a first order keyboard.  Bosanquet was<br/>&gt; &gt; right on the money.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think he got it exactly right.  The suitability of the keyboard depends on the number of chains of fifths, not on the order of the division (as Bosanquet defined it).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Furthermore, on the first-order keyboard the positive first-order divisions don&apos;t have primes 5, 7, and 11 mapped the same way as the negative first-order divisions (yet this doesn&apos;t disqualify the keyboard from being generalized).  It&apos;s all a matter of &quot;insofar as the tunings allow it.&quot;  If you wanted 31 and 41 to have all the primes mapped the same way, you&apos;d need a decimal (Miracle) keyboard, which would also cover 72.  (The decimal keyboard will also accommodate 19 and 53, but the mapping of most of the primes is quite different.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ve read Bosanquet&apos;s 1876 &quot;Elementary Treatise on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Musical Intervals and Temperament&quot;, in which he doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; even mention the 22 division, although I understand he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote about 22 later on.  The generalized keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; described in his 1876 treatise will work just fine with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; any tuning mapped to 22 tones in a chain of 5ths (I know<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; so, because I&apos;ve used 22-equal many times on my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Scalatron), so I don&apos;t really understand your question,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; because there&apos;s no need for a different keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course it works with a chain of fifths, because the<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboard is based on a chain of fifths.  It doesn&apos;t work<br/>&gt; &gt; with tunings that have two distinct chains of fifths.  It<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t work at all for 34, does it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, it doesn&apos;t.

Bosanquet&apos;s first keyboard does one particular (and very important) pajara division, 22, better than schismatic -- better in the sense that 22 is much easier to play than any schismatic tuning.  I make this claim from my many years of experience of playing each of these on an actual generalized keyboard.  The reason for this is quite simple: consider, for example, a 4:5:6:7:9-approximated chord.

It doesn&apos;t do more than any other<br/>MOS-based layout.  It&apos;s special because the things it does are<br/>important.</p><p>Superpyth is simpler than Schismatic, but much less accurate.  I don&apos;t<br/>know why you&apos;d bother with it if you didn&apos;t already have a keyboard<br/>that happened to be designed around fifths and octaves.  If you want<br/>simple 9-limit harmony, and you&apos;re happy with the approximation,<br/>counting generators suggests you&apos;d be better off with a true Pajara<br/>keyboard.  The 9-limit is 8 generators/octave in Pajara compared with<br/>11 in Superpyth (not 9, either you miscounted the 7:5, or there&apos;s<br/>something strange going on).  If there&apos;s some specific feature of the<br/>mapping that makes Superpyth better, fine, but it still isn&apos;t Pajara.</p><p>&gt; A keyboard that will accommodate 12, 17, 19, 22, 29,<br/>&gt; 31, and 41 as well as (if not better than) anything else<br/>&gt; is, in my book, a tough act to beat.</p><p>Yes, we know Bosanquet&apos;s good.  If you want to discuss an alternative,<br/>thirds are the place to look.  Important temperaments will have<br/>thirds.  Hanson and Mohajira will already get you a long way, provided<br/>you&apos;re happy with learning more than one fingering.  If it can cover<br/>both Orwell and Magic, it&apos;d be very handy in the 11-limit.

For an example, myna tempers out 2401/2400, and you can make a keyboard layout for it by using myna-tempered 10/9 and 8/7 as generators. If you do this, (8/7)^11 (9/10)^7 gives the octave. Instead of using myna tempering, you could use breed tempering. For instance, the minimax tuning has the 5-limit just, and 7 flat by (2401/2400)^(1/4), so the generators could be a just 10/9 and an 8/7 sharp by 0.18 cents. You can go along happily until to reach 2, where the step sizes change--they are wolf steps.

Rank one<br/>&gt; temperaments can be treated as if they are rank two, but how<br/>&gt; do you &quot;squeeze in&quot; more generators?</p><p>I can foresee applications for octave-equivalent keyboards (keyboards<br/>with pitch classes) when you use them with computers.  You could have<br/>some kind of auto accompaniment program choosing the inversions.  Or<br/>have the chords from one instrument control the tuning of other<br/>instruments.  Or you can take the lattice at face value, give a pitch<br/>to each key (as I describe for &quot;Breed&quot;, or based on root position<br/>triads for the usual 5-limit lattice) and give up having a choice of<br/>inversion.  This might make sense for a split keyboard, where the left<br/>hand plays chords, and the right hand uses a completely different<br/>mapping.</p><p>Generally we&apos;d be talking about identifying an approximate octave, and<br/>setting it to be exact.  This means adding a unison vector (explicitly<br/>an &quot;octave vector&quot;) and giving a rank 2 temperament.  So at that point<br/>the keyboard&apos;s no more generalized than any other rank 2 layout.  But<br/>it&apos;s still biased toward chords with one particular inversion, and<br/>chord sequences that work in the planar tuning with that inversion can<br/>generalize to different tunings.</p><p>In general with &quot;Breed&quot; you&apos;d need both hands to get specific chord<br/>inversions.  Which isn&apos;t so bad, because I don&apos;t know of a keyboard<br/>that does give you arbitrary inversions of 11-limit chords exceeding<br/>an octave with one hand.</p><p>Generalized keyboards are rank 2 beasts.  The keyboard is always a two<br/>dimensional surface.  There are basic topological reasons why you<br/>can&apos;t escape that.  There are ways of getting higher rank tunings, as<br/>George says, but you lose transposability.</p><p>My &quot;Wicki-style&quot; suggestion was about defining a rank 1 object --<br/>essentially a periodicity block.  You then have a keyboard for the<br/>corresponding equal temperament, but also for rank 2 temperament<br/>classes that include it.  If it&apos;s based on a lattice, any chord in the<br/>generalized root position will either be playable with the same<br/>fingering, or not be playable at all because it lies outside the MOS<br/>you&apos;ve tuned to.  For other inversions, you can make use of two<br/>different &quot;octave vectors&quot; so that you have a choice of fingering.<br/>And whatever fingering you choose will either work or not work<br/>depending on whether the chord belongs to the MOS you&apos;ve tuned to.</p><p>We all seem to agree that the Wicki layout itself its good for 12 note<br/>scales.  My other suggestion was to extend it to 19 notes, and this is<br/>what George disagreed with.  With 19 notes, you can keep the<br/>black/white coloring to help orientation, because 19 is a meantone.<br/>You can also use conventional notation.  But you can also generalize<br/>the keyboard to Magic and Hanson without having to re-learn<br/>fingerings.  Any chords or tunes that happen to work with both scales<br/>will also work with the same fingering.</p><p>Because of the lattice geometry, you still get a (vertical) line of<br/>approximate 25:24 intervals, which are always steps in the MOS.  A 31<br/>note layout, as well as being less manageable, might not be so useful<br/>melodically because the approximate 25:24 isn&apos;t such a useful<br/>interval.  I don&apos;t know how a 22 note keyboard would work out.  It<br/>would, at least, mean you lose the familiarity of black/white keys.</p><p>Of course, if you want more notes, you can relax one of the octave<br/>vectors to get a rank 2 layout.  But you then lose generality between<br/>different temperament classes and if you want to share a keyboard with<br/>different mappings the key colors would be confusing.</p><p>You can&apos;t squeeze in more generators.  You can only squeeze in more<br/>primes with the current generators, which means implying unison<br/>vectors.  So the keyboard stops being generalized across different<br/>temperament classes.  The Breed lattice with 11:9 neutral thirds is<br/>also pretty much restricted to Miracle.  As such it&apos;s not more<br/>generalized than any other Miracle layout.</p><p>                        Graham</p></div>
