This guy is awesome!</p><p>This is a great example of someone who writes music in at least 7-limit JI (in practice it might be schismatic temperament or something, point is it&apos;s quite accurate and not meantone), with more or less familiar-sounding tonality, just &quot;decorated&quot; with xenharmonic sounds, but I&apos;d describe it as *breathtakingly* beautiful.</p><p>In this respect I&apos;d put him in the same category as Eivind Groven, another of my favorites (check out this CD: <a href="http://www.musikkonline.no/shop/displayAlbum.asp?id=24480">http://www.musikkonline.no/shop/displayAlbum.asp?id=24480</a> ). Can anyone recommend any similar artists?</p><p>I remember finding his website ( <a href="http://eufonia.de/">http://eufonia.de/</a> ) many years ago, wishing I could read German, and having my mind blown by things like &quot;Sonnenwind&quot; and the other examples on this page:<br/><a href="http://eufonia.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=105&Itemid=179">http://eufonia.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=105&Itemid=179</a><br/>Does anyone know how I can buy a CD or something that has these complete tracks??</p><p>Another great piece is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8bI4hNQSE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8bI4hNQSE</a> , and also <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gxuySP08Is">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gxuySP08Is</a> which I&apos;ve just heard for the first time.
