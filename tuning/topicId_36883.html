Why did Partch choose G (392Hz)as his 1/1?</p><p>For as simple a reason as the following: G, in the bass clef, was the lowest tone that Partch could sing (intone) and still have full voice. It was his lowest &apos;good pitch&apos;, and worked well with his original stringed instruments.</p><p>Not very scientific, maybe, but that&apos;s where it came from.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
