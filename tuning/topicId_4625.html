Since music exists only in<br/>time, couldn&apos;t a musical fragment in an equal temperament be developed over<br/>time in a way that is fractal. I suppose this would not be considered a<br/>scale. Perhaps the difference is in the development of the musical idea<br/>through time. You could have a fragment from a fractal scale that does not<br/>develop as a fractal, and one from an equal tempered scale that does. An<br/>important component of this would be memory and the ability to perceive<br/>musical relationships through time.  The scale is merely theory as opposed to<br/>the actual music being heard. What about Indian ragas?  Can we compare ragas<br/>to fractals?</p></div><h3>Paul H.
