Using<br/>  the tuning given by Dariush Anooshfar in the Scala scale archives (1/1<br/>  256/243 27/25 9/8 32/27 243/200 81/64 4/3 25/18 36/25 3/2 128/81 81/50<br/>  27/16 16/9 729/400 243/128 2/1), the Db and Gp end up about 20 cents<br/>  flat on the G string (and F&gt; ends up about 28 cents flat on the G<br/>  string), so I guess these are problematic notes either way.  Sehtar<br/>  don&apos;t normally even have a Db fret (relative to the C string, though I<br/>  believe tar normally do, and I&apos;ve actually added one to my sehtar),<br/>  and I normally I only play up to C on the G string anyway, so I think<br/>  this is really a non-issue. :-)</p><p>While we&apos;re on the topic:</p><p>  In case you or anyone else is interested, I was recently given a copy<br/>  of Hormoz Farhat&apos;s dissertation, &quot;The Dastgah Concept in Persian<br/>  Music&quot; in which he wrote that his measurements in 1959 and some UCLA<br/>  students&apos; measurements in 1964 of various tar and sehtar &quot;showed that<br/>  the whole-tone and the semi-tone are relatively fixed in Persian<br/>  music, and they are very close to the Pythagorean whole-step (204 c.)<br/>  and half-step (90 c.).  A neutral step which falls between these two,<br/>  and is the L+C of the scale of Barkeshli, was found to be very<br/>  flexible, varying anywhere from 125 to 150 cents.  It was shown,<br/>  however, that most often it is in the vicinity of 135 cents.&quot;</p><p>  Farhat goes on to give a tuning of steps (in cents):  90 45 70 90 45<br/>  70 90 65 65 70 90 45 70 90 45 70 90, which I think is basically the<br/>  same as Dariush Anooshfar&apos;s tuning (with intervals rounded to the<br/>  nearest five cents).</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p><p>p.s. It&apos;s about 1:00 am and I&apos;m rather out-of-it, so I apologize for my<br/>     rambling and incoherence, but I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d get another chance<br/>     to write much in the next few days, so I wrote just now.  :-)</p></div>
