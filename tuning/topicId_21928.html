The most common ones I know of are (low to high) AEAE or GDGD,<br/>sometimes called bagpipes tuning, also GDAD, ADAE, ADAD, DDAD (yes, the G<br/>string is tuned down to D an octave below the third string, this tuning is<br/>used for Bonapartes&apos; Retreat).</p><p>There&apos;s a really beautiful scordatura in klezmer violin that involves<br/>restringing and set up of your violin. Minor surgery, if you will. It&apos;s<br/>called &apos;tsvay strunes&apos;, roughly that means two strings. You put a D string<br/>in place of the A, file an extra notch in the nut really close to the high<br/>E, tune the D to E an octave below the high E and play &apos;unison&apos; melodies on<br/>the two octave strings together. I am not sure what is put in place of the<br/>normal D string, I think there&apos;s a variety of lower string configurations. I<br/>believe this style can be heard in gypsy violin as well.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:klezmusic@earthlink.net">klezmusic@earthlink.net</a></p><p>Cat hair is a wonderful compliment to any outfit (particularly gig clothes)</p></div><h3><a id=21935 href="#21935">ðŸ”—</a>Kees van Prooijen &#x3C;kees@dnai.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2001 8:23:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m afraid not.

In the following I am briefly summarising what I understood. Please correct me if I misunderstood anything.</p><p>I understand that for the tuning you map the pitches of incoming MIDI note events (128 different values in total) to the corresponding entries in a tuning table. In addition, the channel of these note events can be used to select a tuning table. No other MIDI information is used to affect the tuning as defined by Scordatura (of course some MIDI instrument may interpret other MIDI information for somehow changing pitches). So, at maximum a Scordatura tuning supports 128x16=2048 different pitches at a time (e.g., 12x16=192 pitches per octave).</p><p>So, (a subset of) a JI notation like Sagittal, HEWM or Extended HE could be implemented as follows. A first tuning table implements Pythagorean tuning, 2 (4) further tables implement the Pythagorean tuning transposed by 1 (2) syntonic commas up/down, 2 further transpose the Pythagorean tuning by one septimal comma up/down, further tables transpose by both one syntonic and one septimal comma up/down etc. (with more commas and all possible combinations we soon run out of our 16 channels :)</p><p>In the incoming MIDI notes (e.g., from a sequencer or music notation software), the JI microtonal accidentals for commas beyond 3-limit are then encoded as the channel information, while the note pitch encodes a Pythagorean nominal+accidental (from a chain of only 11 fifths in total, if we need more than we need explicit tuning tables for the Pythagorean accidentals as well). Multiple timbres can be encoded by streaming these notes via different MIDI Ports (16 in total, so at maximum 16 different timbres with the JI setup described above that uses channel information fully for encoding pitches). The tuned MIDI output of Scordatura could then in turn be routed, say, to multiple VST-instruments hosted by some sequencer.</p><p>If we can implement the JI meaning of such notations, then we can also implement ETs that can be represented by these notations, by tempering the tuning tables accordingly.</p><p>Did I understood that correctly?</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>Best,<br/>Torsten</p><p>PS: If folks are interested, the setup above could also be implemented, e.g., by a Kontakt script, but I figure things are likely more convenient with Scordatura :)</p><p>PPS: In my current approach, I am using CC messages to transpose pitches by an amount specified by the  CC message.

combination notes plus 40 single note tuning table triggers<br/>would yield instantaneous access to 820 different tunings! Just the<br/>ability to tune the regular 88-keys would result in 72160 distinct<br/>pitches on the whole in one Scordatura project. With only 40 trigger<br/>notes (for I&apos;d hate to use a trigger note &quot;underfoot&quot;) we had access<br/>to only 3520 distinct pitches on the whole. With dual trigger notes,<br/>the pitch universe is broadened by 20x. Therefore, with just 88 keys<br/>and 80-note maximum polyphony per port, we would have the means to<br/>construct immense microtonal chords with &quot;infinitesimal&quot; pitch<br/>inflexions utilizing at least 16 different timbres. You could increase<br/>the timbres by reducing the polyphony load per patch group, and then<br/>you would have double or triple the timbres. Can any microtonalist ask<br/>for more?</p><p>&gt;&gt; I couldn&apos;t find anything on the internet on DT. Can you explain it<br/>&gt;&gt; Torsten?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This has been discussed recently on this list.

But it appears you cannot get the notes to record pitch-bend<br/>&gt;&gt; information and you cannot use the Logic library of sampled<br/>&gt;&gt; instruments directly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean, because Scordatura encodes microtonal pitches with<br/>&gt; pitchbend it overwrite the pitchbend messages of the incoming MIDI<br/>&gt; events?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I mean, the midi notes I recorded into the Logic Pro arrange window<br/>did not contain any pitch bend information. Possibly, I made a mistake<br/>somewhere.</p><p>&gt; Concerning the Logic library: I remember vagues that Logic&apos;s sampler<br/>&gt; does not support multi-mode, in contrast to other high-end samplers.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Multi-mode meaning what Scordatura does: Open a multi-port and assign<br/>seperate instrument samples to every channel. No, Logic cannot do<br/>that. At least not the version I have, which is 8. Instead, you have<br/>to specify a port and channel in Logic per Scordatura patch group.</p><p>&gt; Thank you!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best<br/>&gt; Torsten<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; --<br/>&gt;&gt; Torsten Anders<br/>&gt;&gt; Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>&gt;&gt; University of Plymouth<br/>&gt;&gt; Office: +44-1752-586219<br/>&gt;&gt; Private: +44-1752-558917<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=86742 href="#86742">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torsten.anders@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2010 6:13:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Ozan,</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t quite understand what you mean by &quot;combination notes&quot;.</p><p>&gt; I mean, assigning two MIDI notes played at the same time as additional<br/>&gt; triggers for accessing further tuning tables.</p><p>OK, that makes sense now.
