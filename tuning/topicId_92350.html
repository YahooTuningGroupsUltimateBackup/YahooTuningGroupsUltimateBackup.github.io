At the very least I&apos;d<br/>factor the critical band dissonance curve into the rating for any dyadic<br/>interval of about 6/5 or under.<br/>    Harmonic entropy seems to say the quarter tone has the highest entropy and<br/>between there and about 7/6 slopes down evenly so far as discordance.  But try<br/>it yourself: I&apos;m betting you&apos;ll find the same thing I have...which is that<br/>dissonance shoots up exponentially between about 12/11 and the semi-tone but is<br/>fairly level between 9/8 and 12/11 and decreases linearly between about 12/11<br/>and 6/5 (see <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/images/image1.gif">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/images/image1.gif</a>).</p><p>&gt;&quot;Then I go on to describe different harmonic approaches I&apos;ve found useful in<br/>&gt;each EDO, different chord-shapes, strengths, weaknesses, synesthetic<br/>&gt;impressions, etc.--all my subjective data on them, if you will.&quot;<br/>   Agreed...this &quot;human factor&quot; is very important.  Perhaps one huge issue (at<br/>least to me) is the function/compositional practices of neutral intervals and<br/>chords using them...you can perhaps compare that to blues&apos; use of quarter-tones<br/>to interpolate between major and minor voicings (and then explain why what you<br/>are doing is so much better than quarter tones, lol).</p><p>&gt;&quot;I originally thought to show each EDO&apos;s approximations to JI, but after<br/>&gt;consideration I realized that I&apos;d have to give multiple ratios for every<br/>&gt;interval,&quot;</p><p>    Right.  The approach I use is to break each EDO scale into a few sub-scales,<br/>each using one of a set of possible ratios for each notes.  The idea is to have<br/>each scale have 2-3 sub-scales and the chords possible in each sub-scale<br/>ultimately summarize a huge percentage of all possible chords.   IE I have a<br/>scale with many neutral, major, and minor intervals and break it up into<br/>A) The diatonic scale<br/>B) A single half-step scale with one neutral tone used (IE 15/11 instead of 4/3)<br/>C) A zero half-step scale with no neutral tones used (ALA 7TET, using both the<br/>15/11 and 11/6 &quot;neutrals&quot;)<br/>   Then I concentrate on the possible chords relative to A,B, or C (one at a<br/>time).<br/>   This way....I don&apos;t think the use of JI is confusing.  Especially if you use<br/>JI up to starting at the 11th harmonic IE x/11 format fractions)...and can<br/>summarize most important ratios within 8 cents accuracy).</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2010 11:35:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>However, when it&apos;s relevant in particular cases, I do mention the harmonic series: i.e. 16-EDO gets low concordance scores because of it&apos;s very poor fifths, but it has very good 4:5:7 chords--the best of any EDO below 25, I think--so I mention this.

I got the values from a spreadsheet that Carl sent me, and I wrote a quick and dirty function where I can paste in the cents values of all intervals in a scale into one column and then get their corresponding concordance scores in the column next to it (I don&apos;t know jack about spreadsheets so it took me quite a while to figure out how to do that!).  I&apos;m not sure what formulation of HE was used to generate the values in the spread-sheet, but I do know it covers the first two octaves and came directly from Paul.</p><p>&gt; I was thinking about this just the other day - basically what you<br/>&gt; want, or what I wanted at least, was to come up with some type of<br/>&gt; &quot;badness&quot; analogue for EDO&apos;s. Something that takes into account both<br/>&gt; error and complexity, and maybe other things too. The complexity of an<br/>&gt; EDO has to be related to its size.

(or the normalized version of it that I use to give &quot;concordance scores&quot;) instead of error.  Like I said, looking at EDOs in terms of error is tough to do unless you have a mapping.  I mean, in 12-tET, we could look at 400 cents as being an approximation to 5/4, to 81/64, to 24/19, to 14/11, etc. etc. and those are all valid ways of looking at it, so it will have a different error depending on which interval we say it&apos;s &quot;supposed to be&quot;.</p><p>That&apos;s what I love about H.E.: it doesn&apos;t care about the exact ratio, it&apos;s a way of scoring according simultaneously to &quot;proximity to a simple ratio&quot; AND &quot;simplicity of nearest ratios&quot;.  Of course, what I DON&apos;T like about H.E. is the fact that an out-of-tune fifth still scores higher than a perfectly-in-tune major 3rd or harmonic 7th...but maybe, you know, that is actually okay?</p><p>One issue with looking at &quot;average concordance&quot; I&apos;ve noticed is that discords like small minor 2nds or wide major 7ths or extra-sharp or extra-flat 4ths and 5ths drag down the overall average.  For instance, 19-EDO is on average more discordant than 12-tET because its tritones and its subminor 2nd and supermajor 7th are so discordant.  This is why I opted to include the average of the four strongest concords--it is there that 19-EDO clearly beats out 12-tET.</p><p>&gt; One idea I had was to make the complexity measure not linearly<br/>&gt; proportional to size, but logarithmically proportional. Let&apos;s say base<br/>&gt; 2 log to keep the math simple. So 12-tet would have a normalized<br/>&gt; complexity of &quot;1,&quot; let&apos;s say. 24-tet would have a complexity of 2,<br/>&gt; 36-tet would have a complexity of 1.584 (log_2(3)), 48-tet would have<br/>&gt; a complexity of 3, etc. This is because if you&apos;re at 41-tet, the jump<br/>&gt; up to 53-tet is going to be less of a pain than the jump from 12 to<br/>&gt; 19, or so my thinking went, since you&apos;re already used to there being a<br/>&gt; lot of notes.</p><p>I wonder if that&apos;s true.  I&apos;ll say that on guitar, the number of notes seems to matter less than the open-string tuning.  For instance, 19-EDO is actually easier to deal with (for diatonic purposed) than 17-EDO, and 31-EDO is a bit easier than 22-EDO in a lot of ways.  All the 5n-EDOs,  like 15, 20, and 25, are easier than any near-by EDOs because you can tune all the strings in 4ths and span 2 octaves exactly.  So on guitar, scoring complexity just by number of notes isn&apos;t necessarily helpful.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2010 2:57:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;     As I&apos;ve said before, I think using harmonic entropy alone to judge<br/>&gt; concordance (no matter what the scaling) is a mistake.

It&apos;s really hard for me to say how much more concordant I find 12/11 to be than 18/17.  I really don&apos;t hear 12/11 as being equally concordant to 11/10, 10/9, and 9/8, but I do find 9/8 and 8/7 and 7/6 to all be fairly close.  Looking at the &quot;normalized&quot; H.E. values that I&apos;m using also gives a different curve, since it&apos;s based on the exponential version of H.E. (i.e. &quot;e^(H.E.)&quot; and is reversed so that low H.E. = high concordance score.

I wax fairly poetic about the quality of neutral intervals at a few points, too.  Intervals that straddle interval classes, like the 450-cent sub-4th/supermajor-3rd--it&apos;s a neat interval, really, despite being discordant as all hell.</p><p>&gt;     Right.

All I want to convey to them is &quot;what sounds good, what doesn&apos;t sound good, what emotional effects are supported, and what patterns relate different EDOs&quot;.  Also, I really hate the &quot;JI bias&quot; that is so common in tuning literature.  JI may be a sort of &quot;ideal&quot; as far as psychoacoustics is concerned, but it doesn&apos;t explain everything about non-JI scales...in fact, it may not actually explain ANYTHING about them.

Meanwhile the 5:7:9 chord sounds quite unsettled despite being<br/>highly periodic.</p><p>    JI (alone) ignores critical band dissonance, emotional effects of possible<br/>chords, how many sets of tones the mind can handle efficiently, how far away<br/>from periodicity you can go without the mind getting confused, dyadic dissonance<br/>(IE chords not based on perfect harmonic series segments ALA 7:8:10), root<br/>tonality (IE the 5:7:9 example), and a ton of other concepts.</p><p>&gt;&quot;but it doesn&apos;t explain everything about non-JI scales...in fact, it may not<br/>&gt;actually explain ANYTHING about them.  &quot;<br/>    Strict JI, dare I say it, seems to even throw out most things like intervals<br/>different than 12TET (IE neutral, supermajor, etc. intervals).  7-limit, to me,<br/>is often barely different than 12TET and where things start really getting is 9+<br/>limit...which is exactly what academic JI seems to try so hard to avoid.</p><p>------------------------------------<br/>  You made some fascinating points on things like how a nasty 16/11 dyad can be<br/>part of a quite &quot;pure&quot; sounding triad...and I&apos;d hate to think your tutorial<br/>would avoid such things because they are &quot;too close to JI&quot;.  I&apos;m not saying you<br/>need to write a &quot;JI essay&quot;...but at least a quick summary of how<br/>non-strict/&quot;open&quot; dyadic JI may in many cases help people determine the overall<br/>consonance (not just concordance!) of a chord would IMVHO be much encouraged.<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>   Now taking dyadic JI analysis of triads and such, as Harmonic Entropy (based<br/>on JI, but not on enforcing periodicity ALA 3+ notes with &quot;the same<br/>denominator&quot;) I think we can both agree matters...otherwise you wouldn&apos;t be<br/>using HE (right)?</p><p>&gt;&quot;What, in the end, matters most?

(or the normalized version of it that I use to give &quot;concordance scores&quot;) instead of error. Like I said, looking at EDOs in terms of error is tough to do unless you have a mapping. I mean, in 12-tET, we could look at 400 cents as being an approximation to 5/4, to 81/64, to 24/19, to 14/11, etc. etc. and those are all valid ways of looking at it, so it will have a different error depending on which interval we say it&apos;s &quot;supposed to be&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s what I love about H.E.: it doesn&apos;t care about the exact ratio, it&apos;s a way of scoring according simultaneously to &quot;proximity to a simple ratio&quot; AND &quot;simplicity of nearest ratios&quot;. Of course, what I DON&apos;T like about H.E. is the fact that an out-of-tune fifth still scores higher than a perfectly-in-tune major 3rd or harmonic 7th...but maybe, you know, that is actually okay?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One issue with looking at &quot;average concordance&quot; I&apos;ve noticed is that discords like small minor 2nds or wide major 7ths or extra-sharp or extra-flat 4ths and 5ths drag down the overall average. For instance, 19-EDO is on average more discordant than 12-tET because its tritones and its subminor 2nd and supermajor 7th are so discordant. This is why I opted to include the average of the four strongest concords--it is there that 19-EDO clearly beats out 12-tET.</p><p>I suppose that the complexity measure will be built into it if you<br/>have more notes, since most of them will be hitting discordant<br/>intervals, thus bringing it down.</p><p>HE is something that I think is primarily good for a very specific<br/>psychoacoustic phenomenon: predicting how intervals, specifically pure<br/>tones, will sound when tempered. The fact that a tempered fifth is<br/>higher than a perfectly in tune major 3rd is because a tempered fifth<br/>simply presents less &quot;options&quot; for misperception than a perfectly in<br/>tune major 3rd. There are a few ways to interpret the HE curve:</p><p>1) Is it measuring, in a musical sense, how &quot;consonant&quot; the interval is? (No.)<br/>2) Is it measuring, in a timbral sense, how strong or loud the<br/>fundamental being produced is? (Possibly indirectly, but not<br/>directly.)<br/>3) Is it measuring, in a timbral sense, how many fundamentals can<br/>match a certain dyad, if that dyad is allowed to be mistuned? (Yes.)</p><p>The second one, IMO, is what a lot of people think HE is measuring,<br/>but that it isn&apos;t really. The fact that 5/4 produces a weaker<br/>fundamental than 3/2 isn&apos;t for the same reason that HE has it listed<br/>as more discordant, for example. It&apos;s listed as more discordant<br/>because there&apos;s a chance it&apos;ll be perceived as a mistuned 6/5, and a<br/>mistuned 7/6, and a mistuned 9/7, and a mistuned 4/3. 3/2 doesn&apos;t have<br/>nearly as many strong intervals in the way, so it&apos;s perceived as being<br/>less confusing.</p><p>If the reason that the 5/4 fundamental is sonically lower in volume<br/>than the 3/2 one happens to be because the 5/4 one confuses your brain<br/>more or something - then HE would be measuring that too. If. But, I<br/>don&apos;t think that&apos;s something we know for sure. It could also be that<br/>there is a neural filterbank capturing in the incoming data, and that<br/>each filter simply has a rolloff so that higher overtones resonate<br/>less strongly than lower ones. In fact, there could be any explanation<br/>for how it works, really, so it&apos;s best not to make assumptions about<br/>that just yet.</p><p>The point of this long tirade? HE is a great concept, and it&apos;s the<br/>best thing we have, but there are a few practical considerations that<br/>have to be made before you really use it as an HE &lt;-&gt; consonance<br/>measure. &quot;Concordance&quot; is a different psychoacoustic percept than most<br/>people think it is, and your concerns about what the curve shows are<br/>very valid :) Entropy models in the future might take additional<br/>factors into consideration, and this might alter the shape of the<br/>curve slightly to match the phenomena you are describing.</p><p>An alternate, but shorter, explanation, is that a tempered fifth will<br/>probably &quot;fuse&quot; more easily than a pure major third if they&apos;re both<br/>played with sine waves. The fact that the pure major third sounds<br/>better with harmonic timbres has primarily to do with beating<br/>partials, I think.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2010 10:49:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Sep 5, 2010 at 8:08 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which rescaling is that?

So 12-tet would have a<br/>&gt; normalized complexity of &quot;1,&quot; let&apos;s say. 24-tet would have a<br/>&gt; complexity of 2, 36-tet would have a complexity of 1.584<br/>&gt; (log_2(3)), 48-tet would have a complexity of 3, etc. This is<br/>&gt; because if you&apos;re at 41-tet, the jump up to 53-tet is going to<br/>&gt; be less of a pain than the jump from 12 to 19, or so my thinking<br/>&gt; went, since you&apos;re already used to there being a lot of notes.</p><p>That&apos;s one way to look at it.  Another is that the number of<br/>possible chords goes up quadratically (Metcalfe&apos;s law).</p><p>Gene&apos;s &quot;logflat badness&quot; is</p><p>error * complexity^(pi(p)/(pi(p)-r)</p><p>where pi(p) is the number of primes, r is the rank (1 for<br/>EDOs) and ^ is exponentiation.  It makes sense in that we<br/>expect higher-rank systems to be more accurate for a given<br/>number of notes.  For instance, rank 1 meantone requires<br/>31 notes to provide the same accuracy that rank 2 meantone<br/>provides in 5.  And it happens that 5^3 ~~ 31^(3/2).</p><p>Gene found that if you plot a histogram showing the number<br/>of temperaments below a given badness as complexity goes to<br/>infinity, the histogram is roughly flat if the complexity<br/>axis is logarithmic and you used the above badness formula<br/>(hence its name).

I&apos;ve never used 16/11 in a triad. &quot;<br/>  In the first song on &quot;Map of An Internal Landscape&quot; I swear you told me you<br/>did and also swear it was some sort of alternative fifth.  Maybe it was 22/15?<br/>I&apos;d be interested to know which one...because (again) it completely fooled my<br/>ear &quot;in context&quot; into thinking it was a &quot;pure&quot; 5th and the triads sounded<br/>surprisingly stable.</p><p>&gt;&quot;One thing H.E. suggests is that &quot;bad fifths&quot; can be stronger concords than<br/>&gt;&quot;good thirds&quot;, or so it seems anyway (maybe my interpretation is unfounded).&quot;<br/>    Hmm...I&apos;d say yes and no.  Anything around 13-20 cents of 3/2 (IE around<br/>1.48) seems to really really bite my ears....but things like 22/15 and even 14/9<br/>often seem passable to the same degree, say, 5/4 is...and in the case of 22/15<br/>perhaps a bit better.  So I agree there is a lean toward<br/>near-simpler-intervals...but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s nearly so strong as HE presents<br/>it at (also HE puts a small dip in dissonance near 22/15, while I hear a huge<br/>sudden dip/bump at 22/15 relative to both its near neighbors 16/11 and 40/27).<br/>40/27, to me, actually sounds as or more dissonant than something like 12/11,<br/>despite being &quot;near the 5th&quot; on the HE curve!</p><p>  It (HE) often sound to me a case of right idea, wrong degrees of exaggeration,<br/>giving too much credits to exact versions of a tone like 3/2 and not enough<br/>credit to its alternative versions.<br/>   Try it yourself (on your own ears) and let me know what you think.....</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2010 8:01:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene&gt;&quot;So much the worse for HE, as 675 cents sounds like crap compared to 7/6.&quot;<br/>     Exactly!

Here&apos;s an experiment for you: try taking two triangle waves at the same pitch, and slowly increase the pitch of one without being able to see what pitch it&apos;s at (a MIDI pitch-bend wheel will probably work for this).

I was bothered at first by how Tenney Height suggested that a pure 3/2 is more than 3 times as concordant as a pure 5/4, until I started thinking of concordance as a measure of &quot;how obvious it is that two tones are sounding, rather than one&quot;.  For this reason, I think B-P &quot;tritave equivalence&quot; may very well be a possibility.</p><p>&gt;   Ok, but still it&apos;s really just looking at the same curve with a different unit<br/>&gt; skew (IE rates &quot;height of consonance&quot; instead of &quot;lowness of discordance&quot;),<br/>&gt; correct?</p><p>Yes.

I agree though...you certainly<br/>&gt; can&apos;t say many TET scales are &quot;just built for one type of limit&quot;.</p><p>That&apos;s the thing, though: unless the H.E. of a tempered interval is very low, you can&apos;t say for sure what limit it is.  I mean, *is* the 240-cent interval of 5-EDO a 7-limit interval?  Yeah, you could say that it&apos;s an approximation of 8/7, but it&apos;s also a 23-limit interval of 23/20, or a 13-limit interval of 15/13.  You could argue that 8/7 is simpler, so is a more &quot;valid&quot; interpretation, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a valid argument.  In 13-limit JI, 15/13 is NOT 8/7, they&apos;re completely distinct intervals.  Or take the 300-cent minor 3rd found in many EDOs: is it a 5-limit interval?  A 13-limit interval?  A 19-limit interval? A 25-limit interval?  It&apos;s pretty darn close to 19/16 and 25/21, and it&apos;s closer to 13/11 than it is to 6/5, so how do we even say what its odd- or prime-limit is?</p><p>The point is, if you&apos;re looking at &quot;n-limit&quot; intervals because you want to approximate JI, then you will want to have consistency.  If you&apos;re looking at n-limit intervals because you&apos;re using n-limit as a gauge of concordance, you&apos;re better off using H.E. anyway.  I mean, look at the EDO charts here:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com/scales.html">http://www.microtonal-synthesis.com/scales.html</a></p><p>They give one ratio that each interval is supposed to approximate, and they give error in approximation.  What sort of useful stuff does this really tell you?  To figure out concordance, you have to know how concordant the JI ratios are, and then how much mistuning effects their concordance.  H.E. tells you this directly.  But then look at it from a JI standpoint: look at their 22-TET page.  They give the 327.27-cent interval as a &quot;40/33&quot;, but they give the 381.82-cent interval as 5/4 and the 709.09-cent interval as a 3/2.  Yet, you can&apos;t have a 5/4 and a 3/2 *without* having a 6/5.  So either than 40/33 is actually a 6/5, that 3/2 is actually a 200/132, or that 5/4 is actually a 99/80.  But since it&apos;s NOT JI we&apos;re dealing with, ALL OF THE ABOVE is correct.  There is an infinite number of ways to interpret any EDO in terms of JI, and even narrowing it down to three or four is hopelessly arbitrary.<br/>&gt; In the first song on &quot;Map of An Internal Landscape&quot; I swear you told me you<br/>&gt; did and also swear it was some sort of alternative fifth.  Maybe it was 22/15?</p><p>It was 40/27.  That song is in 16-EDO, so the fifth is 675 cents, which is actually about 5 cents off, but I think 40/27 is a good-enough approximation of it.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;One thing H.E. suggests is that &quot;bad fifths&quot; can be stronger concords than<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;good thirds&quot;, or so it seems anyway (maybe my interpretation is unfounded).&quot;<br/>&gt;     Hmm...I&apos;d say yes and no.  Anything around 13-20 cents of 3/2 (IE around<br/>&gt; 1.48) seems to really really bite my ears....but things like 22/15 and even 14/9<br/>&gt; often seem passable to the same degree, say, 5/4 is...and in the case of 22/15<br/>&gt; perhaps a bit better.</p><p>As Mike said, what you are hearing is the partials clashing.  Try it with sine waves or maybe triangle waves.</p><p>&gt; It (HE) often sound to me a case of right idea, wrong degrees of exaggeration,<br/>&gt; giving too much credits to exact versions of a tone like 3/2 and not enough<br/>&gt; credit to its alternative versions.<br/>&gt; Try it yourself (on your own ears) and let me know what you think.....</p><p>Well, H.E. does have that variable &quot;s&quot; value for a listener&apos;s ability of discrimination, so maybe giving a different s-value would give results you&apos;d find more agreeable?</p><p>Either way, my ears would suggest that H.E. gives *too much* credit to &quot;alternative 5ths&quot;, but that&apos;s because I&apos;m using harmonic timbres for everything.  With sine or even triangle waves, I find the H.E. curve fits pretty much dead-on.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2010 11:32:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; MOS are not necessarily strictly proper; it depends on the ratio between the large and small &gt; step.</p><p>D&apos;oh.

What commatic build-up?<br/>    Well say if you take 3/2^12 (ALA Pythagorean Diatonic).  You get about<br/>129.7...and the nearest octave/&quot;power of 2&quot; is 128.

I&apos;d suggest trying to<br/>&gt;&gt; A) Single out scales you think have many things in common and group them<br/>&gt;&gt; B) Take one or two examples from each group to explain in detail, giving care<br/>&gt;&gt;to<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; cover general chords/moods/instrument-mappings etc. for such scales.<br/>&gt;&gt; C) Give good &quot;if interested&quot; references to existing documents that explain the<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; rest...or perhaps link to an &quot;in constant development&quot; web page that lists<br/>&gt;&gt; detail about increasingly more scales over time and labels them under each<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;group type&quot;.<br/>Igs&gt;Believe me, I&apos;ve considered my options.  Choosing to stick with MOS scales<br/>is an informed choice.</p><p>    Ugh...I was just saying that I can&apos;t see why &quot;having too many scales&quot; would<br/>be an impenetrable/&quot;non-hackable&quot; road block to influence you to base your<br/>tutorial around only MOS scales.  But now you seem to just be telling me &quot;this<br/>topic is not up for discussion&quot;...so I kind of wonder why you seemed to be<br/>asking for input....but fair enough; you&apos;ve decided.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And how do alternating generators (i.e. rank-3 temperaments, IIRC) eliminate<br/>&gt;commas any better than rank-1 or rank-2 temperaments?&quot;<br/>     If that really is what &quot;alternating generator&quot; means perhaps I have my<br/>definition wrong.<br/>    I always thought higher rank meant the temperament can be generated by<br/>taking ONE OF A SET of multiple generators and creating a scale using only that<br/>generator (x^y letting you change x to be a constant value for each generation).<br/>    For example, Miracle has a secor, which multiplied by itself gives about<br/>8/7, and 8/7^3 gives a fifth.  So any one of these three can be taken to a power<br/>and create and octave...but in NO case do I have to use one and not the other.<br/>Taking about 8/7^5 gives the octave.  A little under 3/2^12 gives the octave.<br/>But it all falls along the line of using one of a set of generators, not<br/>switching/alternating between them in the middle of the scale creation process.</p><p>    Try reaching the octave using either a pure 3/2 fifth OR near-22/15<br/>&quot;alternative fifth&quot; within 12 tones (IE either 3/2^x or about 22/15^x).  Can&apos;t<br/>do it!   Now try alternating between using 3/2 and near 22/15.  IE 3/2 * 3/2 *<br/>about 22/15 * 3/2 etc. ...and you can.  That&apos;s what I&apos;m talking about.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Yeah, you could say that it&apos;s an approximation of 8/7, but it&apos;s also a 23-limit<br/>&gt;interval of 23/20, or a 13-limit interval of 15/13. You could argue that 8/7 is<br/>&gt;simpler, so is a more &quot;valid&quot; interpretation&quot;<br/>  I simply argue round it to the simplest interval within 7 cents of the exact<br/>value.  Usually, at worst, you can round it to the nearest interval up to x/11<br/>and the two will sound and feel fairly alike.</p><p>&gt;&quot;25-limit interval? It&apos;s pretty darn close to 19/16 and 25/21, and it&apos;s closer<br/>&gt;to 13/11 than it is to 6/5, so how do we even say what its odd- or prime-limit<br/>&gt;is?&quot;</p><p>  Now that is one HUGE gray area between 13/11 and 6/5.  it&apos;s about 13 cents<br/>from each of those &quot;nearest points&quot;.  My impulse would be to say &quot;that interval<br/>is just too far gone...give it up!&quot;   But if you had to give it a class...I&apos;d<br/>call it in a &quot;noise&quot; class and forget trying to round it to JI.  Personally,<br/>those two are also so close to each other my ear can&apos;t tell the difference<br/>between them.   Haha...you win on this example...it&apos;s one of those cases where I<br/>don&apos;t think even fairly extended JI can classify it well at all.</p><p>&gt;&quot;It was 40/27. That song is in 16-EDO, so the fifth is 675 cents, which is<br/>&gt;actually about 5 cents off, but I think 40/27 is a good-enough approximation of<br/>&gt;it.&quot;<br/>   Right, 40/27 is close enough.  And it&apos;s awesome how it actually works<br/>consider it must be just about my least favorite &quot;5th&quot; other than the<br/>misery-mooded 16/11.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Yet, you can&apos;t have a 5/4 and a 3/2 *without* having a 6/5.&quot;<br/>   Sure you can.  My scales routinely have neutral stacked thirds that act as<br/>both 3/2 and 6/5 and still count as &quot;just&quot; within 7 cents or so.</p><p>&gt;&quot;There is an infinite number of ways to interpret any EDO in terms of JI, and<br/>&gt;even narrowing it down to three or four is hopelessly arbitrary.&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;they give the 381.82-cent interval as 5/4 and the 709.09-cent interval as a<br/>&gt;3/2&quot;<br/>  Hmm....the difference between the two is about 328 cents, about 12 cents off<br/>3/2.  But there is absolutely NO x/11, x/9...fraction nearby for it to compete<br/>with...the closest one is 14/11 and that&apos;s about 18 cents off!   Thus I&apos;d call<br/>it a bit of a nowhere interval, but round it to 6/5.  My rules of thumb: if the<br/>nearest x/11 does not work and it&apos;s no more than 15 cents from the nearest<br/>simple JI interval, round it to the nearest simple fraction (assuming harmonic<br/>entropy takes over and pushes it a bit).   If x/11 and another interval of x/11<br/>or lower format is almost equally near by (ALA 13 cents or so away)...the<br/>interval is generally registered as noise and not able to be explained in JI.</p><p>&gt;Me&gt;     Hmm...I&apos;d say yes and no.  Anything around 13-20 cents of 3/2 (IE around<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; 1.48) seems to really really bite my ears....but things like 22/15 and even<br/>&gt;&gt;14/9<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; often seem passable to the same degree, say, 5/4 is...and in the case of 22/15<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; perhaps a bit better.<br/>Igs&gt;As Mike said, what you are hearing is the partials clashing.  Try it with<br/>sine waves or maybe triangle waves.</p><p>   It sounds much better with sine waves indeed...but for almost any timbre<br/>(even in-harmonic ones) the 22/15 and 14/9 seem to have an obvious advantage.<br/>What it (and Mike B?!) seem to say is that in some cases critical band<br/>dissonance factors can over-ride harmonic entropy factors in terms of their<br/>contribution to overall sense of consonance.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Well, H.E. does have that variable &quot;s&quot; value for a listener&apos;s ability of<br/>&gt;discrimination, so maybe giving a different s-value would give results you&apos;d<br/>&gt;find more agreeable? &quot;<br/>   Right, but that doesn&apos;t give me much of a tool to &quot;optimize the<br/>&apos;imaginary/varying/user-generated&apos; curve of s&quot;. :-D</p><p>&gt;&quot;Either way, my ears would suggest that H.E. gives *too much* credit to<br/>&gt;&quot;alternative 5ths&quot;, but that&apos;s because I&apos;m using harmonic timbres for<br/>&gt;everything. With sine or even triangle waves, I find the H.E. curve fits pretty<br/>&gt;much dead-on.&quot;<br/>   My ears agree for sine waves but not triangular ones.  When I think of it the<br/>reason it works for sine waves is obvious: a sine wave only recognize the<br/>root-tone...and HE is based largely on root-tone periodicity.  Now if you could<br/>take fully fledged instruments with many harmonics (yes, including the option of<br/>weird FM synthesized sounds) and make them follow the HE curve at &quot;near 100%&quot;<br/>accuracy, that would certainly make me think twice if there&apos;s a way to make HE<br/>summarize nearly all psycho-acoustics behind music.  But as for now I&apos;m still<br/>split something like 60% HE, 40% critical band so far as how much they explain<br/>relative to each other.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2010 4:27:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Sep 6, 2010 at 2:49 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mike wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Paul&apos;s response was that it wasn&apos;t right because his curve<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slopes &quot;down&quot; and mine sloped &quot;up.&quot; That is, 7/1 is supposed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to have a lower entropy than 2/1, for example.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It is ??<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Apparently so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did you mean higher entropy?</p><p>No, I meant lower entropy.

I think the logical<br/>culmination of the concept of chords &quot;sharing notes that work with one<br/>another&quot; is the concept of the scale. Paul threw out as a hypothesis<br/>that whatever causes musical meaning to arise has something to do with<br/>a low-level cognitive procedure taking place right on your mental map<br/>of what&apos;s going on, which has something to do with a scale.</p><p>But if I could figure out why iv in minor resolves so nicely to i, I&apos;d<br/>be a very happy man. I think it has something to do with the structure<br/>of the F minor scale. This is my current obsession to figure out - how<br/>scales work and how mental maps work. I&apos;ve heard a few answers for why<br/>things &quot;resolve&quot; nicely and I still haven&apos;t found anything that<br/>satisfies me 100% yet. They&apos;re usually put in tandem with why only<br/>Aeolian and Ionian are usable as tonal systems that emphasize a<br/>certain note as the tonic. Coming from my musical background, I don&apos;t<br/>think that only Aeolian and Ionian ARE usable as tonal systems, so<br/>these theories usually leave me wanting. I think that Rothenberg has<br/>some of it figured out with his stuff, and I think that Paul has a lot<br/>figured out as well in his 22-tone paper. Someone also put out the<br/>idea a while ago that it was because only Aeolian and Ionian have<br/>dissonant intervals (the tritone) at an interval adjacent to the root<br/>(I think Carl, citing some other author). Perhaps all of these have<br/>something to do with it, but I still personally haven&apos;t seen &quot;the big<br/>picture&quot; yet.</p><p>I don&apos;t think the minorness has much to do with it, because note how<br/>well Bbm resolves to Fmaj as well. Try Dbaug -&gt; Bbm -&gt; F7. Voice it<br/>like this:</p><p>Db-C-F-A<br/>Bb-Db-F-Bb<br/>F-Eb-F-C</p><p>It sounds like some kind of mystical cavern or something. Explain that<br/>one to me :) You can make it Fmaj too instead of F7 and the feeling is<br/>pretty much the same.</p><p>Another neat technique is to use modes as &quot;chords&quot; and the chromatic<br/>scale as the &quot;scale.&quot; That is, chords are mini-reference frames, and<br/>the diatonic scale is the full reference frame in common practice<br/>music. A beautiful modern harmony trick is to use different diatonic<br/>scales as mini-reference frames, and the chromatic scale as the full<br/>frame. So try something like this chord progression:</p><p>||: Gm11 -&gt; Dbmaj9 -&gt; Dm7 -&gt; A13 :||</p><p>Voice it like this</p><p>G-F-G-A-Bb-C<br/>Db-Eb-F-Ab-Bb-C<br/>D-E-F-G-A-C<br/>A-F#-G-A-B-C#</p><p>Or pick your own roughness free voicings if you want, but try to do<br/>some nice voice leading if you can :)</p><p>You can keep the stream of consciousness type thing going for as long<br/>as you want, and it&apos;s possible to get very fluid with this approach,<br/>just as fluid as you can with common practice harmony. Every chord<br/>changes the &quot;background scale&quot; in your mind, and every change has a<br/>certain function that occurs, but you can make it sound as tonal or<br/>non-tonal as you want. You can, if you want, make it sound like a<br/>12-tet version of the eikosany, where every chord is harmonic, but<br/>there&apos;s no root, and where the basic tonal set is C-E-G-B-D instead of<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11.</p><p>||: Gm9 -&gt; Dbmaj9 -&gt; Dm9 -&gt;  A13 -&gt; Ebm7 -&gt; Fm9 -&gt; Cmaj9 -&gt; F#m9 -&gt;<br/>Ebm7 -&gt; Abmaj7/Bb -&gt; Emaj/F# -&gt; Ebm7 :||</p><p>I&apos;ll upload a listening example in a bit to get an idea of what I&apos;m<br/>talking about :) There are lots of things that resolve in different<br/>ways besides what is usually expressed in common practice harmony.
