I&apos;d like to propose that what we need more than anything else is a tuning FAQ.<br/>Perhaps we could all take some time out from our posting schedule to put something<br/>together that could end up being a big time-saver in the future. I&apos;d propose that<br/>everyone with a field of expertise come up with some basic questions and a set of very<br/>patient and broad answers. For now, we need a volunteer to collect the questions in<br/>private e-mail and then post them to see what holes we need to fill, if any . . . So, who<br/>would like to be the great e-mail collector?</p></div><h3><a id=18898 href="#18898">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/17/2001 12:42:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., PERLICH@A... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18895.html#18895">/tuning/topicId_18895.html#18895</a></p><p>&gt;So, who would like to be the great e-mail collector?</p><p>Well, Paul, wouldn&apos;t *YOU* really be the most logical person to do<br/>this,since it&apos;s YOUR idea and you know so much about the subject<br/>matter?

It would be strange for a<br/>FAQ not to mention it.</p><p>Another use of FAQs is that it gives newbies a way in to the subject.  One<br/>rule of electronic discussions is that you should read a group for at<br/>least a week before you post to it.  I reckon at least a month.  But a<br/>newbie to this group could well not understand what&apos;s going on for that<br/>month.

Probably a health warning should be given<br/>for all &quot;what is?&quot; questions, as few terms have an authoritative<br/>definition.  Monzo&apos;s tuning dictionary can be referred to for those who<br/>really care.</p><p>Right, now for some other FAQs.</p><p>What is meantone?</p><p>A system of tuning using a chain of tempered, perfect fifths where 4<br/>fifths approximates a 4:5 major third.

In 19-equal,<br/>the nominals are:</p><p>C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C<br/>0  3  6  8 11 14 17 19</p><p>And a # or b move by 1 step.

I&apos;d prefer we buried the whole<br/>thing in a<br/>&gt; FAQ.</p><p>Forcefully put, and perhaps you are right!  :  )</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Incidentally, my understanding of FAQs is that they hold answers<br/>that are<br/>&gt; agreed on.  That is, they must be a consensus of the groups the FAQ<br/>is<br/>&gt; for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So can&apos;t we agree on what Just Intonation is?  It would be strange<br/>for a<br/>&gt; FAQ not to mention it.</p><p>Agreed. It really should be straight forward since all points of view<br/>are known.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another use of FAQs is that it gives newbies a way in to the<br/>subject.  One<br/>&gt; rule of electronic discussions is that you should read a group for<br/>at<br/>&gt; least a week before you post to it.  I reckon at least a month.<br/>But a<br/>&gt; newbie to this group could well not understand what&apos;s going on for<br/>that<br/>&gt; month.  So either they have to ask redundant questions, and we all<br/>have to<br/>&gt; read the answers over and over again.  Or they get intimidated and<br/>leave.<br/>&gt;  Either is bad.</p><p>I don&apos;t see why it wouldn&apos;t be just as effective to just guide folks<br/>to John Starrett&apos;s page. You can access anything from the simple to<br/>the complex. This way consensus is unnecessary.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, now the question&apos;s reared its ugly head again, can we attempt<br/>an<br/>&gt; answer?  Okay, I&apos;ll try.  Before doing so, I&apos;ll state that I&apos;m not<br/>telling<br/>&gt; anybody to find a new way of describing what they&apos;re doing or<br/>forcing them<br/>&gt; to leave the list.  If anybody thinks I am, this is the last you&apos;ll<br/>hear<br/>&gt; of it.</p><p>Oops, did I summon the Dark One? He, he!</p><p>&gt; JI is tuning using pure intervals, typically small whole-number<br/>frequency<br/>&gt; ratios.</p><p>Not bad.</p><p>&gt; There, how was that?  It isn&apos;t precise, but it doesn&apos;t have to be.<br/>It&apos;s<br/>&gt; for a FAQ, not a dictionary.</p><p>I completely agree here.</p><p>Probably a health warning should be given<br/>&gt; for all &quot;what is?&quot; questions, as few terms have an authoritative<br/>&gt; definition.  Monzo&apos;s tuning dictionary can be referred to for those<br/>who<br/>&gt; really care.</p><p>Yes, so much already exists outside the forum here.

When<br/>&gt;&gt; composers and musicians choose to work in JI [especially those who<br/>&gt;&gt; choose<br/>&gt;&gt; to work exclusively in JI,  I am one myself ] there is often a certain<br/>&gt;&gt; amount of deliberateness, a sort of unwillingness to accept intonational<br/>&gt;&gt; compromise that is indicative of those who accept temperament equal or<br/>&gt;&gt; otherwise. A sort of close enough is good enough attitude.</p><p>&gt;Okay, this much seems to make sense, although it&apos;s a bit flamey.</p><p>&gt;&gt; It must be<br/>&gt;&gt; pointed out that I am not including those who use ET&apos;s or temperaments<br/>&gt;&gt; for<br/>&gt;&gt; their own sake and aesthetic properties but more those who use<br/>&gt;&gt; tempering to<br/>&gt;&gt; approximate JI intervals.</p><p>&gt;Er, so exactly how are you defining &quot;temperament&quot;?</p><p>Good point. Tempering is a bad word. As Dan was pointing out there does not<br/>exist any abbreviation that correctly expresses the taking of arbitrary [or<br/>organised without reference to JI pitches] divisions of pitch.</p><p>&gt;&gt; This is aimed at those who would in one breath<br/>&gt;&gt; state that there is no audible difference between some higher prime RI<br/>&gt;&gt; interval and some intereval in it&apos;s vicinity and then use the<br/>&gt;&gt; nomenclature<br/>&gt;&gt; of JI and pretend that this stands for this in another sentence.</p><p>&gt;All that in one breath?</p><p>&gt;&gt; If there is no audible difference between say 11:9 and the area<br/>&gt;&gt; surrounding<br/>&gt;&gt; it, then why use a ratio in your temperament diagrams?  Cents values and<br/>&gt;&gt; letter names should surely suffice.</p><p>&gt;Indeed they should.  Or why not</p><p>&gt; If there is no audible difference between say 11:9 and the area<br/>&gt; surrounding<br/>&gt; it, then why use a letter name in your temperament diagrams?  Cents<br/>&gt; values and ratios should surely suffice.</p><p>It is not me who says there is no audible difference between the ratio and<br/>the surrounding space ! I say these are the points of strongest consonance.<br/>If a ratio is not correctly intoned then I believe the mind makes up the<br/>difference and tries to hear that ratio.</p><p>It is only for proponents of temperament that the nomenclature is<br/>interchangeable. But it is also meaningless.</p><p>&gt;Or</p><p>&gt; If there is no audible difference between say 11:9 and the area<br/>&gt; surrounding<br/>&gt; it, then why use a cents value in your temperament diagrams?  Ratios<br/>&gt; and letter names should surely suffice.</p><p>See above.</p><p>&gt;Why are ratios so sacred that it&apos;s a sin for them to be used in a &gt;profane<br/>&gt;context?</p><p>Anyone can use any nomenclature device they like, but whether it is<br/>relevant is another matter.</p><p>Perhaps I should start using ratios to denote steps in 19tet and then<br/>people reading these posts could look at this music and see just harmonies<br/>with unlimited modulation.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I cannot understand why some theorists will create some temperament and<br/>&gt;&gt; then say it has this otonality and that otonality when the intervals are<br/>&gt;&gt; sometimes as much as 20 cents removed from the target intervals.</p><p>&gt;What else do you suggest we call a 6:7:9:11 chord?</p><p>I would call it a 6:7:9:11 chord if it was indeed a 6:7:9:11 chord. If it<br/>was tempered I would plot it on a gradient going from more messy to more JI<br/>depending on how accurate it was.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Why are<br/>&gt;&gt; these target interevals necessary if [as these theorists say] there is<br/>&gt;&gt; no<br/>&gt;&gt; audible difference between this exactly pinpointed [high prime] ratio<br/>&gt;&gt; and<br/>&gt;&gt; the surrounding space.</p><p>&gt;Firstly, that seems to use a straw man argument.  Secondly, it &gt;answers<br/>&gt;itself.  If there&apos;s no audible difference, the surrounding space is &gt;the<br/>&gt;same as the interval denoted by the ratio.  QED.</p><p>I am unaware of the straw man argument. But that a ratio denotes a precise<br/>spot means that these ideal spots have acoustical value over the<br/>surrounding area. Otherwise why are they invoked at all ?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Do they want to suck us all into the tempered  camp<br/>&gt;&gt; or are they secretly longing to use just intonation themselves ?</p><p>&gt;Whoa, hold on there!  Somebody, somewhere, said something that<br/>&gt;contradicts<br/>&gt;the tenets of the One True Church.  As a result, they&apos;re either evil<br/>&gt;proselytisers of the tempered path, or jealous apostates?  Give me a<br/>&gt;break!</p><p>This looks more serious on paper than the way i would have said it.</p><p>If JI is the One True Church it&apos;s religion is not encouraged much on this<br/>list.</p><p>&lt;If you have an argument, can you try forming it in a more lucid, &lt;less<br/>&lt;confrontational manner?</p><p>This sentence and most of your reply was more confrontational than my<br/>orignal post. For something to be confrontational there needs to be someone<br/>or something that decides to put itself it&apos;s path.</p><p>&gt; Anyway a defination of JI should be formulated by those who actually use<br/>&gt; JI, not provided for us by those who regard JI as impractical or too<br/>&gt; easy<br/>&gt; mathematically.</p><p>&lt;So who&apos;s going to decide who uses JI without a definition of what JI is?<br/>Are you suggesting an inner circle of initiates be formed, who then choose<br/>to admit novices when they have been enlightened by the True Definition?&gt;</p><p>Yes that&apos;s exactly what I said in my post.  Verbatim ! Hah hah!</p><p>&gt;What if a heretical faction of 1/8-schismic tuners also claim to be &gt;using<br/>&gt;JI?  Are they to be allowed to formulate the Definition</p><p>No definetly not. Me and the JI boys will put a stop to that !</p><p>&gt;, or be cast out<br/>&gt;into utter darkness where there shall be weeping and gnashing of &gt;teeth?&gt;</p><p>No really... It is up to composers themselves to decide whether they are<br/>using JI or not. Your own definition suits me. There are lots of other<br/>definitions of JI that composers can use.</p><p>Most of the people making music in JI are aware of what they are doing and<br/>under which definition they fit.</p><p>&gt;Collection of smiley things to hope this doesn&apos;t get out of hand</p><p>&gt;            :-)    8-)&gt;    }:-))&gt;    =:^)</p><p>Don&apos;t sweat it.

But perhaps his English translator could still be<br/>around to fuel the flames.</p><p>I&apos;ll copy the relevant part here.</p><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/> As early as 1927, Groven published his thesis The Natural Scale, a<br/>pioneer work in which he examined the use of formulas in vocal and<br/>instrumental folk music that might have been derived from the scales<br/>and playing technique used on the willow flute. The two dissertations<br/>Temperering og renstemming (Tempered and Just Intonation Tuning, 1948)<br/>- available in English and German - and Renstemningsautomaten (The<br/>Automatic Just Intonation Tuning, 1968) deal with the familiar problem<br/>of just intonation tuning of keyboard instruments in theoretical and<br/>practical terms. Groven&apos;s contribution in this field has gained<br/>international recognition. He constructed a justly tuned organ in<br/>which he retained the ordinary keyboard, but where each octave is<br/>divided into at least 36 tones, making it possible to play in all<br/>keys. An automatic conversion mechanism &quot;retunes&quot; the instrument as it<br/>is being played so that the chords and harmonies are in tune at all<br/>times. The instrument also makes it possible to construct scales<br/>consisting of steps other than the usual half and whole tones. Such<br/>scales are typical of folk music. Moreover, historical modes of tuning<br/>can also be imitated. Two justly tuned organs, a pipe organ and an<br/>electronic organ are to be found at Eivind Groven&apos;s Institute for Just<br/>Intonation in Oslo.<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>Has anybody mentioned this pioneer of adaptive tuning before, when I<br/>wasn&apos;t paying attention?  The Institute for Just Intonation looks like<br/>a good candidate for a Tuning List coach trip.</p><p>I think Ray Tomes is still on the list.  Note that English title: &quot;The<br/>Automatic Just Intonation Tuning&quot;.</p><p>               Graham</p></div>
