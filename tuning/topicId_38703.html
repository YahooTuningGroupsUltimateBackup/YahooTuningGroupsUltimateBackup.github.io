Is the length of your motivic line (segment, series, set, call it what<br/>you will) proportional to the number of overall tones?</p><p>2. Have you composed something where wide spaced chord tones are the basis<br/>for voice-leading, so that, for example, each note of the chord follows a<br/>voice-leading path, using small cells, and quasi-rules of counterpoint.<br/>(i.e. without using a longer sequence of tones)?</p><p>2, is based on the idea of voice-leading alone without using series. Could<br/>this be possible, and have instead a group of chords which one to could<br/>lead away from and towards. Of course this needs some kind of &apos;dissonance<br/>treatment&apos;, defining some chords as consonant and others as dissonant (not<br/>in an absolute sense, but referentially, arbitrarily, for each new work.)</p><p>I hope I have been clear.</p><p>M</p></div>
