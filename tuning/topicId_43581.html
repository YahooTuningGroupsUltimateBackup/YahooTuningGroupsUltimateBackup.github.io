There are lots of paintings that show<br/>impossibilities and other liberties when using a music subject.  I remember<br/>learning about this while taking a course with Leeman Perkins at Columbia.<br/>It may be the result of meshing realism with a poetic license.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
