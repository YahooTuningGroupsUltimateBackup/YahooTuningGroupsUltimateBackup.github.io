It consists of two intervals of one tone (Gk. _tonoi_, ranging in size from 10/9 to 8/7, possibly as wide as 7/6 (Aristoxenus)) and the interval which remains when two tones are subtracted from a perfect fourth, a semitone.  The 12-tet &quot;lie&quot; of modern music theory, if you will, is that a tone divides equally into two semitones. Of course there is no proportion in just intonation which will do that.</p><p>&lt;Both modes are dependent on the dominant seventh chord for participation in<br/>&lt;the major/minor system (as opposed to &quot;modal music&quot;)</p><p>One can find and compose for oneself perfectly acceptable tonal compositions in Major or minor without sevenths in the dominant chords.  American vernacular harmony may indeed differ on this point, but in parts of that repertoire sevenths sometimes function classically, as dissonances to be resolved, and sometimes as ordinary chord members without dissonance treatment.  However it is striking that one may also play a good deal of vernacular repertoire with all of the sevenths dropped (indeed, some of the earliest recorded examples of 12-bar blues consist only of simple major triads).</p><p>&lt;The business of &quot;three minor scales&quot; is basically nonsense that was invented<br/>&lt;by music educators who chose to &quot;teach&quot; melody before harmony. This<br/>&lt;prevented countless music students (many of whom are now teachers) from<br/>&lt;realizing that the reason for choosing flat 6 &amp; 7 or natural 6 &amp; 7 had<br/>&lt;nothing to do with going up or down, but rather with what harmony is<br/>&lt;prevailing. The dominant chord requires the leading tone while tonic and<br/>&lt;subdominant does not.</p><p>While I agree that music educators do turn a generalization about scalar forms into an unnecessary rule, teaching melody before harmony is certainly not to be criticized.  The idea of making a chorale harmonization without knowing the chorale melody inside and out, and without trying to make the individual lines as melodically attractive as possible is both unmusical and ahistorical. Classically, one mastered counterpoint before learning harmony, that is to say, figured bass; even in the chaconne form, with a fixed harmonic progression, the rules of contrapuntal voice leading had precedence over consistent restatements of the harmony. Your last statements are unsustainable -- melodies have generally preceded their harmonization.  (And before the common practice era, _ficta_ was determined on melodic criteria, often with remarkable harmonic results). Again, there may be exceptions to this in American vernacular practice, but you offer no qualification on this point.</p><p>Dr. Daniel Wolf<br/><a href="mailto:djwolf@snafu.de">djwolf@snafu.de</a><br/><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/</a></p></div>
