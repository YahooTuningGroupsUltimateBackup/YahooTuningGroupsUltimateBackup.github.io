I have built a new musical instrument designed for several tunings between<br/>5edo up to 240edo. The bells are made out of 2mm steel sheet spun on a lathe. The timbrical richness<br/>of the tone doesn&apos;t invite to go any higher than 240edo. The bells can be hit with felt, rubber and wooden<br/>mallets, bowed, played like singing bowls, played inside creating tremolo effect,etc.</p><p>The layout for the 96edo already constructed is with 6 rows of 16 bells (6 tones and a total range of an octave<br/>starting on G above middle C)</p><p>Glissandi can be achieve at many different speeds and by sliding hard mallets or simply by striking all the<br/>notes chromatically a high speeds.</p><p>Another bellophone has been ordered by EMI producer James Sanger. This conic bellophone will be tuned<br/>to 88edo. In order to reduce cost I have looked at the possibility of getting this handcraft job done<br/>in China, and I will be able to reduce the cost hopefully at almost half price. If anybody is interested or knows about an<br/>institution that might be interested this is the time to pay just for the materials and Graham&apos;s friend in china<br/>who is going to spin the steel, since at this point I am not interested to make money out of this.</p><p>The harmonic spectrum of the bells are too rich to search JI precision but Graham has worked out perfect timbral<br/>intonation for these bells according to the amount of bells you want per period. This data is not available yet and<br/>probably something to be discussed at the tuning-math list when samples become available.</p><p>Since I have been waiting to edit the video of the performance which is taking me too long.  I have decided to<br/>make these materials available (recording and pictures) in the mean time.</p><p>LISTEN to Autumn I for conic bellophone and mixed quintet</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Autumn">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Autumn</a></p><p>PICTURES of the conic bellophone</p><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=11323&id=696302104">http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=11323&id=696302104</a></p><p>Tony Salinas</p><p>PS.
