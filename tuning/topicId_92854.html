Neither of these triads is remotely tonal.  -Carl</p><p>Wow, there must be something weird with my ears, then.</p><p>Listen to the 2nd and 3rd chord, they have two notes in common (the 28th and the 45th harmonic), and the middle note goes from 35th harmonic to 36th, sort of like a C#min--&gt;C#maj. directly contrasting the major with the minor.  That change in quality is so obvious to me that it might as well be 20:24:30 changing to 20:25:30.</p><p>No, these chords are neither rooted nor especially concordant, but compared to the 5:6:7 example I posted previously, I can hear the difference between the two types of chord quite clearly.  The penultimate chord feels prominently &quot;major&quot; and resolves half-decently to the final chord (which is also the first chord), which itself sounds prominently &quot;minor&quot; to me (at least in comparison to the preceding chord).</p><p>Admittedly, these chords are much stranger than their &quot;diminished-esque&quot; counterparts--there&apos;s no &quot;ghost fundamental&quot; anywhere to be found, which gives the chords a thin and hollow sound.  But I swear, I can hear the difference in chord type no problem.  I wonder why that is??  Am I hard-wired to prefer non-concordant chords?</p><p>Well, anyway, I&apos;ll post an example using 16:18:21 chords later tonight, hopefully.  I&apos;ll be curious to see if, in that forthcoming example, whether people hear the otonal chords as &quot;major&quot;--i.e. &quot;bright&quot;, &quot;happy&quot;, etc--or the utonal ones.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2010 4:52:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Igs,</p><p>&gt; Listen to the 2nd and 3rd chord, they have two notes in<br/>&gt; common (the 28th and the 45th harmonic), and the middle note<br/>&gt; goes from 35th harmonic to 36th, sort of like a C#min--&gt;C#maj.<br/>&gt; directly contrasting the major with the minor.

For one thing it would have helped if I&apos;d<br/>noticed that the chords were the same except for the middle note.<br/>Then I&apos;d have known what to listen for.  Incidentally, this<br/>motion reminded me of Ivor Darreg&apos;s prelude in 19... I wonder if<br/>they&apos;re the same intervals or if I&apos;m just recognizing the<br/>characteristic step sizes in 19.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2010 5:41:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay gang, here&apos;s another example chord progression I cooked up, this time in 19-EDO.

Note that you&apos;ve messed<br/>around with father temperament more than I have, so perhaps you&apos;re<br/>used to dealing with crazy sharp fifths. I can see if I start to put<br/>myself into father mode I can sort of hear it as minor, but it&apos;s<br/>difficult because I&apos;m very new to father temperament (mavila&apos;s about<br/>as far out as I&apos;ve gone, but after knowsur&apos;s album I&apos;m ready to go<br/>buck w-wild)</p><p>But what did sound minor was at 0:35, where you play something that<br/>sounds like an F augmented chord, and then you move the lower note up<br/>- that sounded like you moved to a distorted F# minor. Now I&apos;m<br/>listening to it again, and the F augmented chord now sounds ilke<br/>F-Bb-Db instead of F-A-Db, and it moves up to Gb-Bb-Db. That is, it<br/>went from Bbm/F -&gt; Gbmaj. I can flip it either way.</p><p>But if by &quot;last chord&quot; you mean the low one that it drops back to, I<br/>don&apos;t hear that as anything but augmented... Some father tempering of<br/>my brain would probably do the trick.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2010 2:06:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; What format would you prefer?</p><p>Something more like Mike&apos; examples; sustained chords.</p></div>
