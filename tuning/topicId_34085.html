But I feel it&apos;s rather cumbersome, using them. I bought<br/>a Fatar SL88 asw controller and because of the keys and would like to<br/>use it. What software/techniques do you use?<br/>Pitchbend? doesn&apos;t it destroy the attack?<br/>How do you learn to think in the new scales?<br/>Phew, lots of questions, but truelly, I appreciate all help.</p><p>Have a good and just(bad joke) day</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>2/12/2002 4:49:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:a4aq7h+ci3h@eGroups.com">a4aq7h+ci3h@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>irrim wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&#xFFFD;m new on this list and new to alt. tunings as well.

I&apos;ve got some software for this at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/software.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/software.htm</a>&gt; and there&apos;s also Robert<br/>Walker&apos;s Fractal Tune Smithy, which keeps moving but a Google search<br/>should find it.  Both of these, and Scala above, are for PCs.</p><p>Pitchbends usually work fine with soft synths and wavetable soundcards,<br/>because the internal MIDI stream isn&apos;t limited by the hardware standard.</p><p>&gt; How do you learn to think in the new scales?</p><p>Work out a good keyboard mapping, and practice.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2002 8:28:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; How do you learn to think in the new scales?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Work out a good keyboard mapping, and practice.</p><p>Talk about distilling it down to the essence!
