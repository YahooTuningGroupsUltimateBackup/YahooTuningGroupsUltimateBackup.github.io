I apologize in advance to those of you<br/>whom I bore.</p><p>So, if you use the perfect fifth of 80 EDO as a generator -- that&apos;s 47\80,<br/>or exactly 705 cents -- then you get a 7- or 12-note MOS scales that temper<br/>out the following commas:</p><p>-----<br/>352/351, or &quot;minthma&quot;, 4.93 cents, monzo | 5 -3 0 0 1 -1 &gt;. This means that<br/>going down three fifths gets you a &quot;minor third&quot; of about 13/11.</p><p>896/891, or &quot;pentacircle&quot;, 9.69 cents, monzo | 7 -4 0 1 -1 &gt;. This is the<br/>product of gentle and minthma. It means that going up four fifths gets you<br/>a &quot;major third&quot; of about 14/11.</p><p>364/363, or &quot;gentle&quot;, 4.76 cents, monzo | 2 -1 0 1 -2 1 &gt;. This means that<br/>14/11 * 13/11 = 3/2: A major third + a minor third = a perfect fifth.</p><p>6656/6561, 24.89 cents, monzo | 9 -8 0 0 0 1 &gt;. This means that going up<br/>eight fifths gets you the thirteenth harmonic, 13/8. It also means that<br/>going up six fifths gets you 13/9, and going up seven fifths gets you 13/12.</p><p>180224/177147, 29.81 cents, monzo | 14 -11 0 0 1 &gt;. This means that going<br/>up eleven fifths gets you the eleventh harmonic, 11/8. It also means that<br/>going up nine fifths gets you 11/9, and going up ten fifths gets you 11/6.<br/>-----</p><p>I&apos;m not sure of the names of the last two commas.</p><p>Note that the effect of the first three commas is to do exactly what 81/80<br/>does for meantone, except instead of 5/4 major thirds and 6/5 minor thirds,<br/>you have 14/11 major thirds and 6/5 minor thirds. In other words, this is a<br/>scale with meantone-like structures, and if you tuned a piano to it, the<br/>modes would seem very familiar (black-key pentatonic, ionian, dorian,<br/>phyrigian, etc.) but have different flavors because of the different<br/>intervals.</p><p>Now, if you&apos;ve played with meantone tunings before, you know that they can<br/>get pretty good approximations to the seventh harmonic, 7/4, without really<br/>&quot;meaning to&quot; (i.e., they weren&apos;t part of classical theory). With a good<br/>7/4, some other intervals creep in, such as 7/5, 10/7, and 7/6. Those<br/>intervals are there because the slightly flattened fifth drives them there:<br/>As you repeat the generator again and again, the error accumulates to give<br/>you (e.g.) those &quot;flatter than minor&quot; minor thirds and such.</p><p>Similarly, this slightly sharp generator gets you pretty good<br/>approximations to the 11th and 13th harmonics (i.e., 13/8 and 11/8) without<br/>really &quot;meaning to&quot;, and pulls in other intervals (13/9, 13/12, 11/9, and<br/>11/6) in the process. (The 11/7 was already pretty good, because the scale<br/>was defined around a good 14/11, which is its inverse.) There&apos;s only one<br/>11/8 in the whole scale, unfortunately, but it&apos;s there.</p><p>The result is the same in both cases: Using a meantone generator will get<br/>you a 7-note MOS consisting of traditional diatonic scales, and going to<br/>the full 12-note MOS will get you the 7/4, 7/6, etc. Using a 47\80<br/>generator will get you a 7-note MOS consisting of traditional diatonic<br/>scales, but tuned differently using 14/11 and 13/11 thirds (among other<br/>differences); going to the full 12-note MOS will get you the 11/8, 13/8,<br/>11/9, etc.</p><p>This is cool because you can actually use this same scale to play I-IV-V<br/>chords with neutral thirds _or_ play I-IV-V chords with sharp-and-spicy<br/>14/11 major thirds _or_ play i-iv-v chords with 13/11 soft-and-mournful<br/>minor thirds. But it&apos;s also cool because you can play things like<br/>1/1-13/12-11/9-3/2-13/8 with pretty good accuracy, which sounds completely<br/>unlike anything remotely I-IV-V-ish. And you get it all within the same<br/>twelve notes.</p><p>The following EDOs and generators temper out all of these commas, each with<br/>slightly different tradeoffs. 46 is the least accurate of the bunch. 17 and<br/>29 temper the commas out as well, but with a lot more damage.</p><p> 46 704.34783<br/> 63 704.76190<br/> 80 705.00000<br/>109 704.58716<br/>126 704.76190<br/>172 704.65116<br/>189 704.76190</p><p>Interestingly, when I plug these commas into Graham&apos;s temperament finder, I<br/>get 17 and 46 note scales, but no twelve-note scales.

The latter shares an important<br/>element with a 705-cent tuning, Jake, which a comment you make<br/>about meantone gives an opportunity to address.</p><p>Jake wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Now, if you&apos;ve played with meantone tunings before, you know<br/>&gt;&gt; that they can get pretty good approximations to the seventh<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic, 7/4, without really &quot;meaning to&quot; (i.e., they weren&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; part of classical theory).

This is a point that can get lost in<br/>the theoretical and practical details that we love to explore<br/>here.</p><p>What I should make clear is that in using something like the<br/>e-based temperament at 704.607 cents -- part of the same family<br/>as 705 cents -- I would not normally attempt major-major triadic<br/>harmony, or for that matter the meantone modal styles of<br/>16th-century Europe. I say &quot;normally&quot; meaning &quot;in usual harmonic<br/>timbres,&quot; since there are timbres which can make 420-cent major<br/>thirds seem quite smooth and restful in the manner of something<br/>much closer to 5/4.</p><p>Rather, I tend to use either 13th-14th century European<br/>counterpoint, where major thirds around 14/11 fit quite<br/>nicely, or some kind of Near Eastern style where Pythagorean<br/>major third (sometimes a bit larger) are a typical<br/>expectation.</p><p>However, I do understand that from a certain perspective,<br/>using these large major thirds in styles where something<br/>close to 5/4 might be expected could be an intonational<br/>equivalent of being &quot;cranked to 11,&quot; and might be heard<br/>as &quot;spiciness&quot; rather than &quot;out-of-tuneness.&quot;</p><p>There&apos;s a real hazard in tuning discussions of taking<br/>things for granted that really aren&apos;t so obvious, for<br/>example that fact that I would generally use meantone<br/>for a meantone style, but something around 704-705 cents<br/>for a medieval or neomedieval style, which seems to have<br/>been my main interest over the last 12 years or so.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105939 href="#105939">ðŸ”—</a>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2013 8:47:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To Keenan, regarding the Temperament Classes from ETs: Um. Wow. :)</p><p>&gt; (Alternatively, you could do it the easy way and let Scala make<br/>&gt; the MOS scale for you from the period and generator, which<br/>&gt; are always the same no matter what vals you use...)</p><p>That&apos;s more-or-less what I did, but I more-or-less stumbled into the scale.<br/>I was actually building a comma pump using aprhowe. That&apos;s |  0 -3 0 -2 3<br/>&gt;, a.k.a. 1331/1323, a relatively simple no-fives 10.44-cent comma.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t looking at it for a musical goal, but just because it was a<br/>relatively simple comma in the 11-limit. So I found an EDO that tempered<br/>out aphrowe, 80 EDO, and started building a comma pump. I used a &quot;down a<br/>minor third, down a major third&quot; pattern with 13/11 and 14/11 thirds; but<br/>then I had to cancel out that pesky 13 because aphrowe is only 11-limit.<br/>When I finished the pump, I tallied up the tones needed and found a<br/>generator that would do the trick: ~3/2, or 705 cents.</p><p>When you use the fifth as a generator and 14/11 and 13/11 as thirds, you<br/>get something with a meantone-ish structure (5L7S). That made me think of<br/>other scales that I&apos;ve thought to be similar, but this one had really nice<br/>approximations to 13-ish intervals, which the others I&apos;d played with didn&apos;t<br/>have.</p><p>As it turns out, I didn&apos;t much care for the comma pump, but I liked the<br/>scale.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think it has a trivial name yet, so there&apos;s no better name than<br/>&quot;2.3.7.11.13 leapday&quot;.</p><p>And I&apos;m fine with not having Yet Another Name. It seems odd to me, though,<br/>that it would be named after a comma that isn&apos;t in the basis of the<br/>temperament. I get saying &quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a> porcupine&quot;, because 250/243 is a<br/>5-limit comma and the five-limit is contained in the name: No matter what I<br/>do with the 13, I get the same effect in the 5-limit because the porcupine<br/>comma is tempered out. That&apos;s really not the case with a no-fives leapday.</p><p>To Margo:</p><p>I wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Now, if you&apos;ve played with meantone tunings before, you know<br/>&gt;&gt; that they can get pretty good approximations to the seventh<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic, 7/4, without really &quot;meaning to&quot; (i.e., they weren&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; part of classical theory).

I understand why now, but when I started I didn&apos;t know the history<br/>of Pythagorean tuning, or that 407 cents sounded out of tune to people back<br/>in the day; I certainly didn&apos;t realize that 417 cents would be even more<br/>extreme. I used Gene&apos;s Cantonpenta scale to do a lot of quartal and quintal<br/>harmony (fancy words for the no-thirds power chords, sus2, and sus4 chords<br/>that I grew up with on guitar) that finally settled down to major and minor<br/>triads. I liked those sounds -- even using strings, which should be one of<br/>the worst timbres to use.

The way I got<br/>to 704.607 cents was a bit more random: I simply decided to set<br/>Easley Blackwood&apos;s R, the ratio between whole tone and diatonic<br/>semitone (the L and s in a 7-MOS), to Euler&apos;s e (2.71828...)!<br/>My idea, I guess, was something about midway between 29-EDO<br/>(R=2.5) and 17-EDO (R=3). But that e-based tuning and 705 cents<br/>(R=2.8) are close neighbors, with 14/11 as a common theme.</p><p>[Keenan wrote:]</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think it has a trivial name yet, so there&apos;s no better<br/>&gt; name than &quot;2.3.7.11.13 leapday&quot;.</p><p>Keenan, in a 29-MOS of Herman Miller&apos;s leapday, we get 5/4 with<br/>21 fifths up. In a 29-MOS at 705 cents, this gives 405 cents,<br/>near 81/64 with 25 fourths at 375 cents closer to 5/4; and in a<br/>46-MOS, 38 fifths up gives 390 cents, comparable to 21 fifths up<br/>in 46-EDO as a good example of leapday.

On one of these points, the best answer<br/>is that you&apos;ve raised a question where I&apos;d like to help in<br/>figuring out the best answer.</p><p>&gt; Thank you very much for pointing that out. You&apos;re obviously<br/>&gt; right, but I didn&apos;t notice because I rarely go beyond 12 notes,<br/>&gt; for technical reasons -- such as that I&apos;m technically too lazy<br/>&gt; so far to figure out how to do it easily with LilyPond and<br/>&gt; Timidity. :)</p><p>I&apos;ve used Timidity and know that I should learn LilyPond, so this<br/>is a question where having a good solution available for handling<br/>larger tuning sets could help lots of people. Of course, there<br/>may be experts here who could suggest such a solution, but I&apos;d be<br/>glad to help if I can.</p><p>With Timidity, I know that either MIDI pitch bends or the more<br/>elegant appraoch of a tuning table or .tbl file could support<br/>these larger sets, but am not sure yet how this would tie in with<br/>LilyPond. Scala can generate a .tbl file, although that might or<br/>might not be relevant to the situation with LilyPond. For example,<br/>for a 24-note regular tuning at 705 cents:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/reg705-24.scl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/reg705-24.scl</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/reg705-24.tbl">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/reg705-24.tbl</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Also, it&apos;s interesting that you wouldn&apos;t use 14/11 and 13/11<br/>&gt; for triadic harmony. I understand why now, but when I started I<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t know the history of Pythagorean tuning, or that 407<br/>&gt; cents sounded out of tune to people back in the day; I<br/>&gt; certainly didn&apos;t realize that 417 cents would be even more<br/>&gt; extreme.</p><p>If &quot;back in the day&quot; means the 13th and 14th centuries, then<br/>81/64 was fine as the everyday major third, relatively blending<br/>but unstable, with yet wider thirds like 14/11 or 9/7 occurring<br/>in expressive styles of intonation. But by the 16th century, with<br/>the 4:5:6 and meantone now in vogue, the older 81/64 indeed<br/>&quot;sounded out of tune,&quot; with a meantone diminished fourth at<br/>around 14/11, 32/25, or 9/7 &quot;even more extreme.&quot;</p><p>So my hesitation would be to use something like 14/11 for<br/>&quot;triadic harmony&quot; where major and minor thirds are expected to be<br/>stable, and something close to 4:5:6 is expected, as in the<br/>16th-17th centuries.</p><p>But from your perspective, my remark on styles like that of the<br/>16th or early 17th century where &quot;something close to 4:5:6 is<br/>expected&quot; might not necessarily apply to music with stable major<br/>and minor triads in the 21st century, where influences such as<br/>rock or extended jazz harmonies a la Mike Battaglia might open<br/>things up to a much wider range of intonations. So what was<br/>pleasantly spicy 700 years ago in an unstable context, a 14/11 or<br/>whatever, might again be pleasantly spicy in some major/minor<br/>triadic contexts as well!</p><p>&gt; I used Gene&apos;s Cantonpenta scale to do a lot of quartal and<br/>&gt; quintal harmony (fancy words for the no-thirds power chords,<br/>&gt; sus2, and sus4 chords that I grew up with on guitar) that<br/>&gt; finally settled down to major and minor triads.</p><p>The interesting thing is that 2:3:4, 8:9:12, and 6:8:9 are also<br/>very common in 13th-century European music, and I agree that<br/>these tunings are great for quartal/quintal harmony! Around 705<br/>cents or 3 cents wide isn&apos;t that much more tempering for fifths<br/>and fourths than in 12-EDO, and in the region of 704 cents, as<br/>with Gene&apos;s Cantonpenta, the impurity is almost identical or even<br/>sometimes a bit less, albeit in the opposite direction.</p><p>&gt; I liked those sounds -- even using strings, which should be one<br/>&gt; of the worst timbres to use. Here&apos;s an example of a &quot;work in<br/>&gt; progress&quot; (that hasn&apos;t progressed for about a year):<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/jdfreivald/cantonpenta-chord-progression">https://soundcloud.com/jdfreivald/cantonpenta-chord-progression</a>&gt;</p><p>Your link illustrates my technical problem in accessing music not<br/>downloadable, if I&apos;m right -- does this call for an application<br/>like RealPlayer or the like, which I&apos;ve not yet managed to<br/>install? But I&apos;d love to hear this!</p><p>&gt; Under your influence, I was thinking of trying to harmonize<br/>&gt; some Gregorian Chant with one of these 14/11 / 13/11 scales,<br/>&gt; keeping in mind your idea that the thirds would be a point of<br/>&gt; tension rather than one of rest.

For example, in a 24-note set with a<br/>generator in the range of around 704.6-705.0 cents, the fact that<br/>25 generators would be more or less close to 5/4 might be a bit<br/>academic, and not so relevant to the purposes of the 24-note set,<br/>for example 2.3.7.11.13.23. But that bit of information might be<br/>less academic if someone has 5 as a priority and is ready to<br/>expand the set! So various approaches might be relevant. With<br/>leapday, I focused on a 29-MOS because that was the basis for<br/>Herman Miller&apos;s name (i.e. February 29).</p><p>David Keenan, around 2000 or a bit earlier, focused on the<br/>diaschismic (e.g. srutal) mapping with 1\2 as a period. This kind<br/>of period other than the octave isn&apos;t so familiar to me either,<br/>and it can lead to a different sense of classification.  For<br/>example, I would reason, &quot;around 46-EDO, 21 fifths yield 5/4;<br/>around 80-EDO, 38 fifths.&quot; As someone often involved with rank-2<br/>or rank-3 tunings, I tend to focus on the chain of fifths. But<br/>someone attuned to the diaschismic concept might say, &quot;Ah, but<br/>the two are really similar, in that each derives 5/4 from the<br/>regular minor seventh less 600 cents.&quot; Like you, I&apos;m not so<br/>familiar with these periods other than 2/1.</p><p>Also, I tend to reason in terms of commas, although not<br/>necessarily in an RMP manner (which I&apos;ll let others judge). For<br/>example, I would note that around 704.0-704.4 cents, say, a close<br/>5/4 results from 21 fifths, that is, a regular major third around<br/>14/11 less a 17-comma on the order of 25-30 cents (in effect a<br/>56/55). But by 705 cents, with the 17-comma at only 15 cents, we<br/>need two of them to reduce a regular 420-cent major third to ~5/4 at 390 cents -- or +4 fifths for the 14/11, and +34 fifths for<br/>the two 17-commas by which it is narrowed. These seem to me very<br/>different situations, although from a diaschismic perspective<br/>they might be synonymous (minor sevent less 600 cents gives 5/4).</p><p>&gt;  If we want an octave period, we could call it 2.3.7.11.13<br/>&gt;  srutal, or 2.3.25.7.11.13 srutal if we add 2048/2025, I guess,<br/>&gt;  but that means no 5/4.  Please correct me if I&apos;m wrong, I&apos;m<br/>&gt;  still not too confident with regular temperaments with a<br/>&gt;  period other than the octave. ;)</p><p>Clearly you&apos;re far more acquainted with RMP theory than I am, so<br/>others will need to judge your srutal analysis. Does your<br/>notation refer to a 25/16 approximation? A curious thing I note<br/>in Scala is that the two most common minor sixths, the regular<br/>one at 780 cents and the septimal one at 765 cents, are almost<br/>identically distant from 25/16 at 772.627 cents. Interesting how<br/>either approximation is off by something a bit less than 225/224<br/>with a 705-cent generator.</p><p>&gt; I suppose you meant<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/11232">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/11232</a>&gt;</p><p>Thank you for catching and fixing this.

I am inclined to join Christopher Page, a<br/>strong advocate of Pythagorean or wider major thirds for<br/>Continental music of the era, in supposing that these stable<br/>English thirds were &quot;mollified&quot; at something around 5/4.</p><p>Walter Odington, around 1300, tells us that 81/64 and 32/27 are<br/>not far from the simpler ratios of 5/4 and 6/5, and that singers<br/>make these intervals &quot;fully consonant,&quot; which may suggest some<br/>intonational nuances. In contrast, descriptions in Continental<br/>treatises of the same era that the voices of a third &quot;are heard<br/>to differ greatly, and yet concord,&quot; or that thirds &quot;are neither<br/>perfectly concordant nor perfectly discordant&quot; would fit nicely<br/>with 81/64 and 32/27.</p><p>Ah yes, agreed.<br/>Also worth mentioning is perhaps that Ramis, who is accredited with making<br/>the 5/4, and therefore ultimately meantone temperaments, popular,<br/>based this 5/4 major third on his observations on how singers naturally sing<br/>the major third.<br/>Which also suggests that (at least some) practice of 5/4 major thirds<br/>probably pre-dated the meantone era.</p><p>However, what I do not see is a strong link between differences in meantone<br/>and Pythagorean leading to different music.<br/>The music is all fifth based, and all music from the middle ages till now<br/>functions perfectly well in Pythagorean.<br/>And in my opinion would have just as well been written had the popular<br/>tuning of the 16th century till the 20th century been Pythagorean instead of<br/>meantone.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But by the 16th century, with the 4:5:6 and meantone now in<br/>&gt;&gt; vogue, the older 81/64 indeed &quot;sounded out of tune,&quot; with a<br/>&gt;&gt; meantone diminished fourth at around 14/11, 32/25, or 9/7<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;even more extreme.&quot;</p><p>&gt; 81/64 as &quot;out of tune&quot; is quite a strong statement.</p><p>Since Jake, whom I was quoting on &quot;out of tune,&quot; and I, very much<br/>like large major thirds for various purposes, what we are both<br/>addressing is the idea that 81/64 or 14/11 can sound &quot;unstylish&quot;<br/>in a 16th-century context where some shading of meantone<br/>(1/3-comma to 1/11 comma) would be the likely historical choice.<br/>It&apos;s a beautiful major third in a less happy context.</p><p>Aah ok, sorry I missed that context of Â“out of tuneÂ”.<br/>Yes agreed on Â“unstylishÂ”. Not in an Â“objectiveÂ” musical context (as if<br/>meantone is implied by the music), but in a historically correct context<br/>meantone is of course known to be correct.</p><p>This assumes harmonic timbres, and focuses specifically on the<br/>16th and earlier 17th centuries, the periods which &quot;music based<br/>on stable major and minor thirds&quot; mostly suggest to me in my own<br/>musical activity.

I see a major third as<br/>de-constructible into 4 fifths (like a circle progression does for instance)<br/>and so does western music.<br/>I donÂ’t see any functional change by using 5/4 major thirds, nor does this<br/>change the music.

Meatone does give harsher sounds a more<br/>pleasant timbre than Pythagorean.<br/>But I do not see it as necessary for any instruments, including harpsichord.<br/>Personal preferences do come in play here.</p><p>CanÂ’t agree with counterpoint rules though.<br/>To me they imply the exact opposite.<br/>The thirds and sixths are not perfect consonances in counterpoint, but<br/>specifically imperfect consonances.<br/>And the rules for imperfect consonances are very different from the perfect<br/>consonances.<br/>For instance: no parallel fifths or octaves allowed, but parallel thirds and<br/>sixths are fine (within reason).</p><p>And in a harmonic timbre, my ears agree that meantone wonderfully<br/>agrees with a 16th-century style, and Pythagorean likewise with a<br/>14th-century Continental style.</p><p>&gt; As for the ~705 cents fifths range of temperaments.<br/>&gt; I find these interesting as well for the following reason:<br/>&gt; They turn the augmented prime into a small neutral second, and<br/>&gt; the diminished third into a large neutral second (and the<br/>&gt; diminished fourth and augmented second into neutral thirds).</p><p>This is precisely one of the main charms of these temperaments<br/>from around 703.45 to 705 cents, let us say, and also heavier<br/>temperaments out to 17-EDO (705.88 cents), where the diminished<br/>fourth and augmented second are identical at around 353 cents.</p><p>&gt; So one can easily express maqams melodically, while also<br/>&gt; harmonizing them with chromatic chord progressions following<br/>&gt; western harmony and counterpoint rules.</p><p>Certainly we can agree about these temperaments providing many of<br/>the genera of maqam music, which indeed is one of my primary uses.<br/>The question of whether, when, and why to develop hybrid forms<br/>combining maqam with European polyphony, as I have done at times<br/>in ways involving elements and patterns of 13th-14th century<br/>European technique, is really a discussion in itself.</p><p>Perhaps a discussion weÂ’ll have somewhere in the future! :)<br/>I find this one of the most interesting topics there are.<br/>The neutral intervals and how they function in a harmonic context.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Marcel</p></div>
