For these<br/>&gt; reasons, I haven&apos;t done much nut compensation in the past, but you are<br/>&gt; inspiring me to do some experiments, come up with measurements, and maybe<br/>&gt; make nut compensation (or at least partial compensation for average strings)<br/>&gt; a standard feature.</p><p>Walter Vogt showed me his measurements in 1979 when I came to his workshop<br/>in M&#xFFFD;hlen am neckar, a little village in the Black Forest in Germany. I did<br/>spend a full day overthere playing the new classical guitar I ordered and<br/>Vogt explained me many things about the way he worked. He had a specially<br/>designed experimental instrument on which he could actually measure the<br/>distance from the fret to the nut (any string, any position) once the result<br/>corresponded to exact equal temperament. He used a tuning device by Wandel &amp;<br/>Goltermann. Several sets of the same classical strings - they were all<br/>Augustine Blue - gave different results at every measurement. One of these<br/>results occured in his publicity flyer for the fine-tunable guitar with<br/>moveable frets he later devellopped. Only in six cases the result<br/>corresponded to what you might mathematically expect. Luckily I kept this<br/>folder:</p><p>Position  Mathematically  1st String  2nd      3d      4th     5th     6th<br/>I         36,1 mm         36,0        36,2     36,3    36,2    36,0    36,1<br/>II        70,5            71,5        71,2     71,7    70,5    72,3    70,4<br/>III       103,3           102,5       102,4    103,9   105,6   105,0   102,2<br/>IV        134,2           134,6       132,6    134,0   135,8   136,0   133,2<br/>V         163,2           164,7       159,5    163,8   164,4   164,0   163,2<br/>VI        190,6           191,6       188,5    191,0   192,0   192,0   189,5<br/>VII       216,4           216,7       213,5    216,6   218,0   218,3   217,0<br/>VIII      241,0           241,0       238,2    240,0   242,6   242,8   242,8<br/>IX        264,1           264,5       261,8    264,5   265,0   265,6   266,0<br/>X         285,7           285,6       283,2    285,0   288,0   287,0   286,7<br/>XI        306,0           306,0       303,5    305,0   308,3   308,0   307,4<br/>XII       325,1           326,4       323,9    325,3   326,6   326,8   326,8<br/>XIII      343,4           343,3       340,6    343,0   344,0   344,5   343,4<br/>XIV       360,7           361,5       358,0    359,6   360,2   362,0   360,6<br/>XV        376,9           377,5       374,5    375,0   376,7   378,7   377,3<br/>XVI       392,3           393,0       390,0    390,4   391,6   394,0   392,7<br/>XVII      406,4           407,0       404,0    404,9   407,0   408,2   407,3<br/>XVIII     420,0           420,4       418,2    419,0   421,7   421,9   421,1<br/>XIX       432,8           433,0                                        434,6</p><p>Moveable frets which are set accurately to 12tet clearly show the interest<br/>of a tuneable nut. Vogt devellopped this later on. I have one on my guitar.<br/>First I *tune* the six single frets in the first position. Whenever a fret<br/>is too much out of the straight line I correct the point on the nut where<br/>the string starts vibrating and *tune* the fret once more. Frets are<br/>slightly *moon*shaped - like this: ) - to compensate for lateral<br/>displacement. Due to the shape the vibrating length increases, which lowers<br/>the tone, while the lateral displacement sharpens the tone.</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf, Paris</p></div><h3><a id=5625 href="#5625">ðŸ”—</a>Wim Hoogewerf &#x3C;wim.hoogewerf@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/20/1999 4:29:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----------<br/>&gt;De&#xFFFD;: &quot;Glen Peterson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Glen@OrganicDesign.org">Glen@OrganicDesign.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&#xFFFD; : &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;Objet&#xFFFD;: [tuning] RE: micro-guitar-tunings<br/>&gt;Date&#xFFFD;: Mer 20 oct 1999 17:13<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Glen Peterson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Glen@OrganicDesign.org">Glen@OrganicDesign.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    From: &quot;Wim Hoogewerf&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wim.hoogewerf@fnac.net">wim.hoogewerf@fnac.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Walter Vogt showed me his measurements in 1979 when I came to<br/>&gt;&gt; his workshop...<br/>&gt;&gt; a specially<br/>&gt;&gt; designed experimental instrument on which he could actually<br/>&gt;&gt; measure the<br/>&gt;&gt; distance from the fret to the nut (any string, any position)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did you see this instrument?  Could you describe it?</p><p>I saw it in his workshop and there&apos;s a picture in the folder showing Vogt<br/>doing his measurements. It&apos;s a sort of rough guitar with a diamond shaped<br/>body and a metal plate instead of the ebony fretboard. Vogt is pushing an<br/>artificial finger in a perfect vertical way towards the string. The picture<br/>is not detailed enough to see exactly what&apos;s going on. Any suggestions how I<br/>could show this folder to the tuning list?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Goltermann. Several sets of the same classical strings - they were all<br/>&gt;&gt; Augustine Blue - gave different results at every measurement.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using multiple sets of strings gives credibility to his results.  This is<br/>&gt; great stuff!  The chart was very interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; One of these<br/>&gt;&gt; results occured in his publicity flyer for the fine-tunable<br/>&gt;&gt; guitar with<br/>&gt;&gt; moveable frets he later devellopped.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tell me more about these moveable frets.  Many people have emailed me about<br/>&gt; things like this.  Some even mentioned the crescent shaped frets.  If you<br/>&gt; can compensate at the nut and bridge, do you still need to compensate every<br/>&gt; fret?<br/>Definitely.</p><p>In the first version (about 1984) every single fret, in a crescent shape<br/>already, had to be fixed with a small screw and could be moved about 5 mm in<br/>both directions. That was enough to make corrections to obtain a *perfect*<br/>equal temperament. A 1-limit just intonation, all the octaves were in tune,<br/>which was quite a revolution for the classical guitar! A pianotuner in Paris<br/>confirmed me that in this way at least the classical guitar tuning was<br/>*understandable*. Thirds and fifths had their right number of beats! It<br/>remained impossible though to set the frets to for instance Werckmeister<br/>III. (I tried it, but missed some important steps.) I have an original Vogt<br/>guitar on which this system has been build in in 1986. A few years later<br/>Vogt improved the system by replacing the little screw by a small rubber<br/>ring which fixed the single fret inside an aluminium<br/>rail, thus allowing the fret to slide without limits. Instead of screwing<br/>and un-screwing the fret can simply be pushed in both ways with a special<br/>device. The fixation is solid enough to keep the fret perfectly in place<br/>while playing. My Van der Waals guitar has been transformed with this system<br/>about ten years ago. The first system seemed to add some very high partials<br/>in he timbre of the guitare. On the Van der Waals guitar I didn&apos;t notice any<br/>change in the actual sound of the instrument. This is the guitar I used to<br/>realize John Dowland&apos;s fret settings and to play spanish renaissance music<br/>(Narvaez, Milan, Mudarra...) in a 5-limit JI. Triple satisfaction: the sound<br/>from an instrument of the same person who build lutes for some very famous<br/>lutenists nowadays, perfect 5/4, 6/5 and 3/2&apos;s and very refined compositions<br/>in which hardly ever an interval over 5-limit occurs.</p><p>The technical realization of the moveable frets is far too complicated to<br/>explain by simple text and I&apos;m not a technician enough myself to be really<br/>sure about what I&apos;m saying. Vogt worked as precice as possible, most of the<br/>time with a 1/100 mm standard and built a huge number of special machines to<br/>transformate the guitars and produces the frets. They were all over the<br/>place. The system is really build in. It&apos;s not a ready-made fretboard. Be<br/>welcome to ask any questions.</p><p>--</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf, Paris</p></div>
