Now I can explain<br/>more clearly my own statement that I have not yet seen any examples of<br/>_direct_ &quot;enharmonic&quot; or fifthtone progressions a la Nicola Vicentino<br/>in Gesualdo, although Blackwood provides splendid illustrations of<br/>diesis distinctions between notes in very close proximity, and I shall<br/>add two more examples here.</p><p>In Section 1, Paul, I clarify my rather narrow and possibly fussy<br/>definitions of concepts such as &quot;direct chromaticism&quot; or &quot;direct<br/>enharmonicism,&quot; and confirm that Blackwood, you, and I seem much in<br/>accord as to the fine fit between Gesualdo&apos;s music and the 31-note<br/>meantone system described and realized by his early contemporary<br/>Nicola Vicentino and late contemporaries Scipione Stella and Fabio<br/>Colonna, among others.</p><p>In Section 2, I consider the complexity of Gesualdo&apos;s music from the<br/>viewpoints of modality, altered melodic intervals, and vertical<br/>sonance, urging that it be approached as much as possible in its own<br/>terms, and in the context of various 16th-century chromatic and other<br/>techniques which Gesualdo cultivates and further develops.</p><p>In Section 3, I argue that a system of 31 meantone pitch classes (of<br/>which Gesualdo uses 20 in his madrigals) is a felicitous intonational<br/>model, and that meantone is a tuning system at once sweet for the<br/>stable concords of this music and strikingly assertive for the<br/>augmented or diminished intervals and diesis contrasts of a type<br/>described by Blackwood.</p><p>In Section 4, distinguishing between the later historical concept of<br/>&quot;standard pitch&quot; and the 16th-century problem of pitch drift within an<br/>ensemble, I cite Giovanni Battista Benedetti&apos;s argument around 1563<br/>that just intonation following the syntonic diatonic is impractical<br/>for performers because it would result in such drift by multiple<br/>commas. Interestingly, as discussed by Claude Palisca, Benedetti may<br/>have been one of the first known European theorists to use frequency<br/>ratios in comparing degrees of concord between pure intervals.</p><p>In Section 5, surveying Gesualdo&apos;s musical neighborhood, I note his<br/>connection with the composer and keyboard designer Scipione Stella,<br/>whose 31-note meantone instrument with some notes replicated for<br/>easier fingering evidently served as a basis for Fabio Colonna&apos;s<br/>_Sambuca Lincea_, with some dispute between Stella and Colonna as to<br/>exactly who invented what first.</p><p>In Section 6, I consider specific and general indications that<br/>Gesualdo&apos;s madrigals were not infrequently performed by instrumental<br/>ensembles, or by mixed voices and instruments, although _a capella_<br/>renditions (voices alone) are certainly one possibility; and also a<br/>keyboard canzona by Gesualdo likely written for an instrument with 19<br/>or more pitch classes available, such as the Neapolitan _cembalo<br/>chromatico_ or a full 31-note instrument of the Stella/Colonna<br/>variety.</p><p>In Section 7, finally, I consider a theme suggested by some of the<br/>posts of Paul Erlich: the imprecision of musical perception, which may<br/>not observe nuances such as the small inflections involved in<br/>meantone-based adaptive JI (on Vicentino&apos;s keyboard in his second<br/>tuning, or by singers or players of flexible-pitch instruments), or<br/>the mathematical distinction between 1/4-comma meantone and 31-tET.<br/>This imprecision leaves open some tantalizing if uncertain inferences<br/>from remarks of theorists at the time.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Gesualdo&apos;s &quot;near-direct&quot; diesis distinctions and Vicentino<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As some readers may be not be too surprised to see demonstrated, the<br/>essence of a musicological mindframe may often seem to be a love of<br/>rather fussy distinctions. The following discussion of Vicentino<br/>(1511-1576) and Don Carlo Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa (1560-1613) may<br/>illustrate this trait, while confirming my agreement with and<br/>indebtedness to both Easley Blackwood and Paul Erlich for some superb<br/>examples of what I might term &quot;almost-direct&quot; diesis contrasts in<br/>Gesualdo&apos;s madrigals.</p><p>Earlier in this thread, I offered the remark that I had not seen any<br/>examples in Gesualdo of Vicentino&apos;s _direct_ &quot;enharmonic&quot; or fifthtone<br/>progressions, for example C-C*-C#, where an ASCII asterisk (*) stands<br/>for Vicentino&apos;s dot above a note raising it by a diesis equal to about<br/>1/5-tone or 1/31 octave.</p><p>At the same time, I added that Gesualdo uses notes an enharmonic<br/>diesis apart in rather close proximity, for example B# and C. Thanks<br/>to you, Paul, and to Blackwood, I now can joyfully affirm that this<br/>was rather an understatement, since melodic figures such as C-B-B#[2]<br/>or Eb-D-D# (see below) do occur with only a single note intervening<br/>between the pair a fifthtone apart. Another example below shows an<br/>equally close juxtaposition of sonorities with A# and Bb, although<br/>here not in the same voice.</p><p>We now encounter the musicological quibble of which the reader has<br/>been warned: a tendency to define _direct_ &quot;chromaticism&quot; or<br/>&quot;enharmonicism&quot; quite narrowly to mean the writing of an outright<br/>melodic interval of a chromatic semitone (e.g. G-G#) or enharmonic<br/>diesis (e.g. B#-C or D#-Eb). This very narrow definition may still<br/>provide a distinction between Gesualdo and Vicentino -- at least<br/>unless and until someone cites a direct enharmonic progression in<br/>Gesualdo.[3]</p><p>However, I enthusiastically agree with Blackwood and Paul that figures<br/>such as C-B-B#, like the &quot;direct fifthtone progressions&quot; C-B#-B or<br/>B-B#-C, very neatly illustrate the use of diesis contrasts available<br/>in a 1/4-comma meantone (or &quot;adaptive meantone-based JI&quot;) system, or<br/>the almost identical 31-tone equal temperament (31-tET).</p><p>While Blackwood, to my recollection, does not discuss the direct<br/>enharmonicism of Vicentino, his eloquent words about Gesualdo might<br/>nicely convey the kinship between these practices[4]:</p><p>      &quot;The availability of more than twelve notes makes possible<br/>       the placement in close proximity of two notes that differ<br/>       by a diesis (41.059 cents). This unusual and expressive<br/>       melodic device is strikingly used in _Merce grido<br/>       piangendo_.</p><p>       In bars 1 and 2, the soprano makes the succession C-B-B#<br/>       and a listener hears at once that B# is very substantially<br/>       lower than C.... Subjectively, this device is perceived as<br/>       an expressive inflection of a sort totally impossible<br/>       within the confines of conventional 12-note equal tuning.&quot;</p><p>Recognizing this kinship, we might still point to two features of<br/>Vicentino&apos;s enharmonic technique which may distinguish it from<br/>Gesualdo&apos;s. The first is the use of direct melodic fifthtones, whether<br/>spelled using conventional notation (e.g. C#-Db) or Vicentino&apos;s diesis<br/>signs (e.g. Ab-Ab*-A). The second is what Vicentino terms &quot;enharmonic<br/>cadences&quot; or related progressions where the &quot;major semitone&quot; is<br/>avoided (the usual diatonic semitone of 3/5-tone) while the minor or<br/>chromatic semitone (2/5-tone) is favored.[5]</p><p>To quote an example from Vicentino&apos;s treatise, using a MIDI-style<br/>notation where C4 is middle C and &quot;r&quot; shows a rest, in 2/2 meter (with<br/>the minim or half-note as a moderate beat):</p><p>1    &amp;    2   | 1    2</p><p>r    A4   Ab4   A4<br/>E4        E*4   E4<br/>C4        B*3   C2   C#2<br/>A2        E*3   A2</p><p>This example illustrates at once the direct fifthtone steps E4-E*4-E4<br/>in the next-to-highest part; the altered melodic fifths A2-E*3-A2 in<br/>the bass (equivalent to meantone diminished sixths, ~49:32); and the<br/>cadential progression between the outer voices of major third or tenth<br/>to octave (E*3-Ab4 to A2-A4) with the upper voice ascending by a<br/>chromatic semitone (Ab-A) of 2/5-tone. The concluding ornamental<br/>figure of C2-C#2 in the next-to-lowest voice, shifting from the minor<br/>third to the more conclusive major third above the bass, has an<br/>affinity to somewhat more conventional 16th-century chromatic styles.</p><p>Here it will be observed that Vicentino&apos;s enharmonic nuances leave the<br/>usual vertical consonances of third-plus-fifth-or-sixth above the bass<br/>unaltered; for example, E*3-B*3-E*4-Ab4 could be described as the<br/>usual cadential sonority E3-B3-E4-G#4 with each note raised by a<br/>diesis (one could alternatively write E*3-B*3-E*4-G#*4).</p><p>From this perspective, let us return to the &quot;almost-direct&quot; diesisism<br/>of Gesualdo. In addition to Blackwood&apos;s example from Gesualdo&apos;s<br/>madrigal _Merce, grido piagendo_ (Book V, 1611 and 1613), I have found<br/>an instance at the end of this phrase from _Tu piangi, o Filli mia_<br/>(Book VI, 1611 and 1613), p. 21, bars 24-27 of the same edition used<br/>by Blackwood[6], here read in 4/2 meter, with a Bb signature.</p><p>Here I&apos;ll use Bn (for B-natural) to confirm the presence of this<br/>inflection, with each note understood to be sustained until a rest or<br/>the conclusion of the excerpt, thus generally avoiding the problem of<br/>ties (the dash before the first note of the middle part shows that it<br/>is a suspension from the previous measure). I do use dots to show the<br/>prolongation of a semibreve or whole note by half of its usual value<br/>(a total duration of three beats rather than two), supplying such dots<br/>apparently omitted by the modern editor at bar 27 in the two highest<br/>sounding voices:</p><p>              25<br/> 1   2   3  4  | 1   2  3   4  &amp; | 1  &amp;  2  3   &amp;  4  | 1   2  3  4  |<br/> Eb5 D5  r       r<br/> r               Bn4    Bb4        A4 A4 A4        G4   F4.       F#4<br/>_C5  Bn4 r  G#4      G4     F4 F4  F4.             Eb4  D4.       D#4<br/> G4      r       r      Db4        C4      Bb3 Bb3 Bb3  Bb3 A3 A3 Bn3<br/> G3      r       E3     F3         F3      G3  G3  G3   D3  D3    Bn2</p><p>Here we have lots of conventional late 16th-century dissonances and<br/>idioms, and characteristic traits such as frequent motions of the bass<br/>by a third up or down, as well as the striking figure Eb4-D4-D#4 at<br/>the conclusion of the middle voice.</p><p>Like C-B-B# in Blackwood&apos;s example, we have diatonic semitone<br/>(3/5-tone) down immediately followed by a chromatic semitone<br/>(2/5-tone) up, with an enharmonic diesis between the first note and<br/>the last.</p><p>Here&apos;s an example of a &quot;diagonal&quot; near-direct diesis relationship from<br/>_Ancor che per amarti_, at p. 94, mm. 25-26, of the same modern<br/>edition of the Sixth Book of Madrigals[7], here a piece without<br/>signature, so that I show the two forms of the step B/Bb simply as B<br/>and Bb. This passage sets the text _Poi che vil fango anchor_:</p><p>  25<br/>  |  1   2    3   &amp;   4 | 1  &amp;  2 ...<br/>     r<br/>     r   A#4  A#4 A#4 B4  D5    C#5<br/>     r   C#4  C#4 C#4 B3  G4    A4<br/>     r   F#4  F#4 F#4 E4     D4 E4<br/>     r   F#3  F#3 F#3 G3  Bb3   A3</p><p>We have an almost-direct diesis contrast between A# in the highest<br/>sounding voice of the repeated opening sonority and Bb at the<br/>beginning of the second measure, with only a single sonority<br/>intervening.</p><p>The expressive tritone suspension Bb3-E4 opening the second measure<br/>leads to a conventional cadence of the remissive variety (with<br/>descending semitone Bb3-A3) to A3-E4-A4-C#5, concluding on Zarlino&apos;s<br/>harmonic division of the fifth (major third above bass, in contrast to<br/>the arithmetic division with the minor third above the bass). This<br/>cadence features the traditional progressions expanding from major<br/>third to fifth (Bb3-D4 to A3-E4) and from major sixth to octave<br/>(Bb3-G4 to A3-A4).</p><p>Gesualdo&apos;s use of A# here makes possible the more euphonious harmonic<br/>division of the fifth F#3-C#4-F#4-A#4, while also setting the stage<br/>for the near-direct diesis contrast with Bb. The melodic diminished<br/>fourth outlined in the bass, F#3-G3-Bb3, is also noteworthy, with<br/>other composers such as Giaches de Wert and Claudio Monteverdi using<br/>this interval expressively.</p><p>In sum, I heartily agree with Blackwood that diesis contrasts are a<br/>vital part of Gesualdo&apos;s music, and with you, Paul, that someone<br/>encountering melodic progressions such as C-B-B# or Eb-D-D# might well<br/>speak of &quot;quartertones&quot; -- which I would amend in a friendly manner to<br/>the more precise &quot;fifthtones.&quot; Such figures are distinguished by only<br/>one intervening note from the direct fifthtone music of Vicentino or<br/>Colonna based more expressly on a full 31-note cycle.</p><p>--------------------------------------------<br/>2. Complexity and sophistication in Gesualdo<br/>--------------------------------------------</p><p>On a philosophical note, I would caution against an excessive reliance<br/>on evolutionary concepts of history both older and newer which tend to<br/>propose a more or less progressive development from the simple to the<br/>complex. Gesualdo&apos;s art is an immensely complex and sophisticated one,<br/>and the challenges as well as opportunities for ensembles seeking<br/>felicitous intonations are at once nontrivial and exhilarating.</p><p>This music is based on a system of 12 modes adorned with various<br/>chromatic and nearly-direct enharmonic figures, as well as altered<br/>intervals both melodic and vertical of a kind partially described by<br/>Vicentino (1555) and explored by composers such as Wert.</p><p>This Manneristic agenda colors the use of an extended meantone system,<br/>distinguishing it from either a possible 18th-century agenda based on<br/>what might be described as in some ways a much simplified major/minor<br/>key system, or a possible 21st-century agenda based on using<br/>approximations of such ratios as 7:9:12 in neo-Gothic progressions.</p><p>Vicentino, in exploring the new as well as traditional intervals of<br/>his 31-note system, shows that then as now, tastes may vary. He finds<br/>the &quot;minimal third&quot; of 7/5-tone (~7:6) and &quot;proximate major sixth&quot; of<br/>24/5-tone (~12:7) rather dissonant, and the minimal seventh of<br/>25/5-tone (~7:4) somewhat more so, although noting that any of these<br/>intervals might be used to express an appropriate text.[8]</p><p>In contrast, he finds the &quot;proximate minor third&quot; of 9/5-tone, which<br/>he describes as having an approximate ratio of 11:9 and of leaning<br/>toward the outstanding concord of the usual major third at 5:4, to be<br/>rather concordant, and uses it as a cadential embellishment in some of<br/>his examples.</p><p>Thus &quot;n-limit&quot; concepts may not capture the subtle distinctions<br/>of Joe Monzo&apos;s &quot;sonance&quot; between intervals which may be treated as<br/>unstable or inconclusive but nevertheless recognized to have a degree<br/>of &quot;concord&quot; or &quot;compatibility&quot; in a given style.</p><p>In Vicentino or Gesualdo, the most complex stable ratios are defined<br/>ideally by factors of 5 (5:4, 6:5, 5:3, 8:5), but following and<br/>expanding earlier precedents they deploy a great variety of altered<br/>intervals as well as more or less conventionally treated dissonances.</p><p>Whether we are focusing on the altered intervals of these composers,<br/>or on the subtle adjustments singers and players may have made to<br/>obtain purer vertical consonances, Vicentino&apos;s words of advice in<br/>introducing his examples of enharmonic cadences are worthy of our<br/>attention.</p><p>Noting that the enharmonic genus with its fifthtone steps &quot;permits the<br/>creation of steps and leaps beyond the rational,&quot; from which reason<br/>&quot;such a division is called an irrational ratio,&quot; he continues [9]:</p><p>          &quot;A pupil must learn such disproportioned steps and<br/>           leaps in order to become a perfect musician and<br/>           perfect singer. Also, [s/]he should know how to<br/>           match and accompany with harmony all sorts of<br/>           disproportioned and irrational intervals, and<br/>           also how to sing them so as to show the world<br/>           that [s/]he is exceptional and can accomplish<br/>           with artifice that which cannot be done by reason.&quot;<br/>           (Inclusive English pronouns mine -- M.S.)</p><p>In Gesualdo, devices of this nature range from the &quot;commatic&quot; figure<br/>described as early as 1357 by Johannes Boen with two successive<br/>descending (or sometimes ascending) diatonic semitones, e.g. Ab-G-F#,<br/>to unusual leaps of a diminished fifth or diminished fourth or minor<br/>ninth.</p><p>The striking vertical dissonances favored by Gesualdo -- like<br/>Monteverdi and other contemporaries around 1600 -- also present subtle<br/>questions of tuning, with a 31-note meantone model providing an<br/>attractive starting point. While modern writers ranging from Blackwood<br/>to many more specialized historians often lean toward an 18th-19th<br/>century terminology in describing these sonorities, a more period-<br/>inclined approach may emphasize the plurality of forms and<br/>combinations in this fluid modal setting.</p><p>---------------------------------------<br/>3. Meantone: assertive as well as sweet<br/>---------------------------------------</p><p>While singers and players of flexible-pitch instruments would<br/>certainly not be bound by the fixed tuning of 19-note or 31-note<br/>keyboard, even such a keyboard can provide a reasonably faithful and<br/>enthralling realization of Manneristic music with its chromatic and<br/>sometimes enharmonic idioms.</p><p>At the outset, it might be well to note Blackwood&apos;s less than precise<br/>language when he comments that Gesualdo&apos;s vocal compositions fit the<br/>conventions of meantone tuning &quot;with one exception -- they frequently<br/>use more than twelve notes. It should not be surprising that a<br/>composer of vocal music should find it unnecessary to heed a<br/>restriction associated solely with the limitations of keyboard<br/>instruments.&quot;[10]</p><p>This might easily be amended: &quot;Gesualdo&apos;s compositions frequently use<br/>more than 12 notes, thus exceeding the range of a standard meantone<br/>keyboard, but nicely according with a musical environment where<br/>harpsichords or organs offering 19 notes or even a full 31-note cycle<br/>inspired their own repertory of keyboard music by composers such as<br/>Trabaci and, in at least one apparent instance, Gesualdo himself.&quot;</p><p>In fairness to Blackwood, I would add that his discussion of meantone<br/>emphasizes the many chromatic and other special effects available<br/>_even_ within a usual 12-note compass, and then presents Gesualdo&apos;s<br/>music to show the yet expanded possibilities such as diesis contrasts<br/>which a larger gamut offers.</p><p>In my view, it is unnecessary to turn to Vicentino or Gesualdo in<br/>order to experience the assertive qualities of 16th-century meantone,<br/>although their music exemplifies this quality _par excellence_. The<br/>diminished fourths or augmented fifths of Spanish vocal and keyboard<br/>music, including the beautiful pieces of Antonio de Cabezon for organ<br/>or clavier (harpsichord or clavichord), provide one prime example.</p><p>This is not to mention the audacious enharmonic sonorities of an early<br/>17th-century musician such as Fabio Colonna, who includes ratios such<br/>as 17:12 in his theoretical system and favors fifthtone &quot;slides&quot;<br/>producing vertical intervals such as a fourth a diesis wider than the<br/>usual interval (not too far from 11:8).</p><p>Of course, meantone also expresses itself in the tranquil flow of<br/>smoothly concordant sonorities, punctuated here and there by an<br/>ornamental figure or suspension dissonance, typical of so much<br/>16th-century music.</p><p>The genius of the tuning is that it can at once approximate the ideal<br/>of a seamless musical fabric woven largely of Renaissance JI concords,<br/>and realize the chromatic or enharmonic drama of a Lasso, a Vicentino,<br/>or a Gesualdo.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>4. Just intonation and pitch drift: a 16th-century view<br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>While absolute pitch in the 16th century apparently varied widely,<br/>with each locale or even ensemble having its own standards[11], the<br/>issue of pitch drift within a given ensemble during the performance of<br/>a given piece was both known and asserted as a problem of just<br/>intonation based on Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic diatonic as described by<br/>Ludovico Fogliano (1529) and Zarlino (1558).</p><p>My purpose here is not to resolve the open question debated among<br/>modern scholars of Renaissance polyphony such as Margaret Bent and<br/>Roger Wibberley, as well as advocates of various alternative tuning<br/>systems, as to whether such drift is good or bad, only to document<br/>that the issue was a 16th-century concern, and for at least one<br/>theorist a serious objection to classic JI as a practical ensemble<br/>tuning.</p><p>Around 1563, as chronicled by Claude Palisca, the philosopher,<br/>mathematician, and musician Giovanni Battista Benedetti corresponded<br/>with the great composer Cipriano de Rore (1516-1565) on the question<br/>of interval ratios and intonation.[12]</p><p>While traditional medieval and Renaissance theory defined intervals<br/>in terms of string ratios, Benedetti took some passages from Aristotle<br/>as the basis for what might be termed a frequency-based approach,<br/>focusing on the _intervallum tremoris_ or &quot;period of vibration&quot; for a<br/>string, which he states is inversely proportional to the length of the<br/>string.[13]</p><p>For example, in the case of a 2:1 octave, &quot;the larger portion of the<br/>string will complete one period of vibration (_intervallum tremoris_)<br/>during the time it takes the shorter to complete two.&quot; Likewise for a<br/>3:2 fifth, &quot;the longer portion of the string completing two periods of<br/>vibration during the time the lesser portion completes three.&quot;[14]</p><p>         &quot;Benedetti then arrives at the law which states that<br/>          that the product of the number representing the string<br/>          length and the number of periods of the longer portion<br/>          of the string will equal the product of the number<br/>          representing the string length of the shorter portion<br/>          and the number of periods of this portion....</p><p>          He proceeds to calculate the products for each of the<br/>          consonances recognized by Fogliano, which are:<br/>          diapason [2:1] 2, diapente [3:2] 6, diatessaron [4:3] 12,<br/>          major sixth [5:3] 15, ditone [5:4] 20, semiditone [6:5] 20,<br/>          semiditone [6:5] 30, and minor sixth [8:5] 40. He notes<br/>          that these numbers agree among themselves with a wonderful<br/>          reasonableness (_mirabili analogia_).<br/>          (Ratios in brackets added for convenience -- M.S.)</p><p>Benedetti thus surveys the standard 16th-century consonances in terms<br/>of &quot;the order of concurrence of the terminations of percussions of<br/>waves of the air through which sounds are generated&quot; (_ordinem<br/>concursus percussionum terminorum, seu undarum aeris, vnde sonus<br/>generatur_).[15] The smaller the product of the two terms of a musical<br/>ratio, the more frequently their periods of vibration concur.</p><p>As Palisca remarks, this approach to consonance theory seems to fit<br/>neatly with the just intonation models of Fogliano and Zarlino. For<br/>Benedetti, however, a complication precluded the practical use of the<br/>syntonic diatonic by voices or instruments: the problem of pitch<br/>drift.</p><p>Taking some musical excerpts, including an example from a chanson of<br/>Rore himself, Benedetti proceeds in his first of two letters to Rore<br/>to analyze the melodic whole-tone and semitone sizes of the syntonic<br/>diatonic required to maintain just vertical concords.</p><p>Only in the second letter, however, does he come to the point of this<br/>exercise: &quot;Bendetti declares that if these different sizes of<br/>semitones and whole tones are used, as they must be if the consonances<br/>are tuned justly, a vocal composition will not end on the same pitch<br/>as it began but either higher or lower.&quot;[16]</p><p>He proceeds to give examples of what might now be termed two &quot;comma<br/>pump&quot; progressions, each not surprisingly involving the maintenance of<br/>pure fifths at both G-D and D-A. These patterns, causing a rise or<br/>descent by a syntonic comma (81:80, ~21.51 cents), are typical of such<br/>modes as G Mixolydian or D Dorian[17]:</p><p>1    2   | 1    2  | 1 ...       1  &amp;  2  &amp;  | 1  &amp;  2  &amp;  | 1 ...<br/>G4   A4         G4               r  D4    C#4     D4    E4   G4<br/>D4         E4        D4          r  G3    G3   A3 D3 G3      r<br/>G3   D4    C4        G3          G3    E3      A3    r       G3</p><p>(a) Rise of 81:80                (b) Fall of 81:80<br/>Upper voice: 9:8 - 10:9          Upper voice: 27:25 - 16:15<br/>           G4    A4    G4                   D4     C#4     D4</p><p>While Benedetti concludes that temperament of the vertical concords is<br/>a practical necessity for performers, if one wishes to avoid such<br/>drifting of pitch then another solution is the adaptive JI tuning<br/>described by Vicentino (1555, 1561) as one alternative for his<br/>archicembalo and arciorgano with &quot;perfect fifths and perfect thirds.&quot;</p><p>Again, my purpose here is not to argue the issue of whether comma<br/>drift _should_ be considered a musical vice and/or virtue, only to<br/>show that the issue was fully recognized by a 16th-century theorist<br/>and composer keenly attuned to acoustical and mathematical questions<br/>of consonance.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1.

There is a common musicological distinction between &quot;accidentalism&quot;<br/>or the use of accidentals (routinely mandated by 14th-16th century<br/>guidelines such as &quot;closest approach&quot; in theory and practice), and<br/>&quot;chromaticism&quot; in the sense of direct chromatic semitones of the kind<br/>appearing in adventurous 14th-century or 16th-century music, although<br/>16th-century as well as modern writers often use such terms more<br/>freely. Vicentino goes so far as to regard any writing of a direct<br/>interval of a minor third, found in the Greek chromatic genus, as a<br/>momentary shift from the diatonic to that genus -- a point disputed by<br/>such theorists as Lusitano and Zarlino.</p><p>4.

At pp. 338-339, he<br/>finds that the proximate major sixth A-Gb (~12:7) &quot;produces less<br/>harshness&quot; than A-Gb* (~7:4), &quot;since it is smaller by one diesis.&quot;<br/>One is tempted to paraphrase: &quot;The proximate major sixth more<br/>resembles a major sixth, concordant in a 16th-century setting, while<br/>the minimal seventh more resembles a usual minor seventh, in this<br/>setting a clear discord generally treated with some caution&quot; -- in<br/>contrast to the freer treatment of minor sevenths in 13th-14th or<br/>17th-19th century styles.</p><p>9.

This unusual and expressive<br/>&gt;        melodic device is strikingly used in _Merce grido<br/>&gt;        piangendo_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        In bars 1 and 2, the soprano makes the succession C-B-B#<br/>&gt;        and a listener hears at once that B# is very substantially<br/>&gt;        lower than C.... Subjectively, this device is perceived as<br/>&gt;        an expressive inflection of a sort totally impossible<br/>&gt;        within the confines of conventional 12-note equal tuning.&quot;</p><p>I had another half hour in the library last night, before I&apos;d read this.<br/>I couldn&apos;t find such a motif in the opening.  The first B# I could see was<br/>in bar 28.  And it is in the soprano, at the end of a C-B-B#!  So I wonder<br/>why I missed it at the opening.  If I&apos;d had the exact bar numbers, I&apos;d<br/>have taken a photocopy to check later on if it really wasn&apos;t there.</p><p>The progression I did find, in jazz notation, is Gm-Am7-Em-G7-Em-G#.  The<br/>diesis is between the C in Am7 and the B# in G# major.  There&apos;s no easy<br/>way of respelling it to avoid the diesis.  Although the Em and G# chords<br/>have no notes in common, so you could re-write G# as Ab, Gesualdo seems to<br/>prefer the indirect diesis to the direct bad thirds.</p><p>Note that, although C and B# are two notes apart in the soprano, there are<br/>two chords in between them.  Also, there&apos;s a move from a root of G to G#,<br/>so a chromatic semitone, with one chord in between.  This may not be<br/>relevant, as root progressions weren&apos;t so important in those days(?)<br/>Three voices move by that chromatic semitone, one indirectly (D-B-D#)</p><p>&gt; &gt;From this perspective, let us return to the &quot;almost-direct&quot; diesisism<br/>&gt; of Gesualdo. In addition to Blackwood&apos;s example from Gesualdo&apos;s<br/>&gt; madrigal _Merce, grido piagendo_ (Book V, 1611 and 1613), I have found<br/>&gt; an instance at the end of this phrase from _Tu piangi, o Filli mia_<br/>&gt; (Book VI, 1611 and 1613), p. 21, bars 24-27 of the same edition used<br/>&gt; by Blackwood[6], here read in 4/2 meter, with a Bb signature.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;               25<br/>&gt;  1   2   3  4  | 1   2  3   4  &amp; | 1  &amp;  2  3   &amp;  4  | 1   2  3  4  |<br/>&gt;  Eb5 D5  r       r<br/>&gt;  r               Bn4    Bb4        A4 A4 A4        G4   F4.

The chord progression that involves<br/>the diesis is Eb-Bb-Dm-B.  Again there&apos;s a root progression by a chromatic<br/>semitone, with another chord in the middle.  And there the chords are the<br/>same kind, so it may be more relevant.  Three parts move by that chromatic<br/>semitone, two of them directly, as the notes are held.</p><p>And again, it&apos;s a seemingly innocent progression that happens to throw up<br/>a diesis.  We can only guess at whether Gesualdo fixed it to give this<br/>result.  That a voice was held over two chords to give that -3 +2 both<br/>times is suggestive.</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s an example of a &quot;diagonal&quot; near-direct diesis relationship from<br/>&gt; _Ancor che per amarti_, at p. 94, mm. 25-26, of the same modern<br/>&gt; edition of the Sixth Book of Madrigals[7], here a piece without<br/>&gt; signature, so that I show the two forms of the step B/Bb simply as B<br/>&gt; and Bb. This passage sets the text _Poi che vil fango anchor_:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   25<br/>&gt;   |  1   2    3   &amp;   4 | 1  &amp;  2 ...<br/>&gt;      r<br/>&gt;      r   A#4  A#4 A#4 B4  D5    C#5<br/>&gt;      r   C#4  C#4 C#4 B3  G4    A4<br/>&gt;      r   F#4  F#4 F#4 E4     D4 E4<br/>&gt;      r   F#3  F#3 F#3 G3  Bb3   A3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We have an almost-direct diesis contrast between A# in the highest<br/>&gt; sounding voice of the repeated opening sonority and Bb at the<br/>&gt; beginning of the second measure, with only a single sonority<br/>&gt; intervening.</p><p>Ah yes, so more direct in one sense, but the notes are further apart.</p><p>&gt; The expressive tritone suspension Bb3-E4 opening the second measure<br/>&gt; leads to a conventional cadence of the remissive variety (with<br/>&gt; descending semitone Bb3-A3) to A3-E4-A4-C#5, concluding on Zarlino&apos;s<br/>&gt; harmonic division of the fifth (major third above bass, in contrast to<br/>&gt; the arithmetic division with the minor third above the bass). This<br/>&gt; cadence features the traditional progressions expanding from major<br/>&gt; third to fifth (Bb3-D4 to A3-E4) and from major sixth to octave<br/>&gt; (Bb3-G4 to A3-A4).</p><p>Seemingly innocent again?  No root progression by a chromatic semitone<br/>this time.  Indeed, no parts move by chromatic semitones.</p><p>&gt; Gesualdo&apos;s use of A# here makes possible the more euphonious harmonic<br/>&gt; division of the fifth F#3-C#4-F#4-A#4, while also setting the stage<br/>&gt; for the near-direct diesis contrast with Bb. The melodic diminished<br/>&gt; fourth outlined in the bass, F#3-G3-Bb3, is also noteworthy, with<br/>&gt; other composers such as Giaches de Wert and Claudio Monteverdi using<br/>&gt; this interval expressively.</p><p>That is an interesting interval!  In the bass, as well.  Do you have<br/>examples of it being used directly (without the G3 in the middle)?</p><p>&gt; In sum, I heartily agree with Blackwood that diesis contrasts are a<br/>&gt; vital part of Gesualdo&apos;s music, and with you, Paul, that someone<br/>&gt; encountering melodic progressions such as C-B-B# or Eb-D-D# might well<br/>&gt; speak of &quot;quartertones&quot; -- which I would amend in a friendly manner to<br/>&gt; the more precise &quot;fifthtones.&quot; Such figures are distinguished by only<br/>&gt; one intervening note from the direct fifthtone music of Vicentino or<br/>&gt; Colonna based more expressly on a full 31-note cycle.</p><p>Yes, but they&apos;re also distinguished in that the dieses arrive as a<br/>side-effect of progressions with standard intervals.  Whereas Vicentino<br/>deliberately spiced up standard progressions to get different intervals to<br/>come out.</p><p>&gt; On a philosophical note, I would caution against an excessive reliance<br/>&gt; on evolutionary concepts of history both older and newer which tend to<br/>&gt; propose a more or less progressive development from the simple to the<br/>&gt; complex. Gesualdo&apos;s art is an immensely complex and sophisticated one,<br/>&gt; and the challenges as well as opportunities for ensembles seeking<br/>&gt; felicitous intonations are at once nontrivial and exhilarating.</p><p>I do find it interesting how closely linked Gesualdo&apos;s music appears to be<br/>to that which came after.  Of course, the conventions of spelling with a<br/>closed circle of fifths were forged in this meantone era when they did<br/>make a difference to the sound.</p><p>The very ending of Merce grido piangendo is also interesting.  It happens<br/>to be Ex. 42 in the Watkins book (Clarendon Press, your edition may vary)<br/>although not in the accidentals chapter, so I don&apos;t know what he has to<br/>say about it.</p><p>The progression from bar 30 is G-Gm-A-G#m-Bb-B-Em-E.  So all nice 5-limit<br/>triads.  The Eb of C minor is interesting in that it throws up a<br/>diminished third with the C# of A major.  Although they are in different<br/>voices.  There&apos;s also an indirect wolf between Eb and the G# that starts<br/>the melody.</p><p>But the really interesting chord is that Bb major.  It gives a Wolf<br/>between Bb and D# in the lowest two voices.  Different voices, but a<br/>direct melodic step.  That&apos;s along with the other intervals thrown up.<br/>Really, it should be spelt as a A# major.  So why isn&apos;t it?  Possibly<br/>because Cx would lie outside the gamut.</p><p>However, it does mean a direct progression of similar chords by a<br/>chromatic semitone is brought in.  With the two lowest voices both moving<br/>by a chromatic semitone.  In fact, this cadence is full of chromatic<br/>semitones!  So it&apos;s exactly what I was looking for to support the<br/>hypothesis that chromatic semitones should be preferred at cadences.</p><p>Of course, one example only goes so far.  But maybe it isn&apos;t a coincidence<br/>that it occurs so close to a diesis pump.  Perhaps Gesualdo saved his<br/>&quot;quartertone&quot; experiments for certain pieces.  Because those were the ones<br/>he wrote with access to a split key keyboard?  So here&apos;s another<br/>hypothesis to test:  look at the ends of the other pieces with semi-naked<br/>diesis pumps, and look for chromatic semitones!</p><p>The wolf rules out any 9-limit interpretation, BTW.</p><p>So far in my limited analysis, I haven&apos;t found a root progression by a<br/>diatonic semitone.  The statistically invalid sample off one fits the<br/>hypothesis perfectly.  I know it&apos;s an anachronistic concept, but I would<br/>be interested in other examples of semitonal root progressions,<br/>particularly the early examples of Neapolitan sixths.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/23/2001 4:07:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Bill Alves &lt;ALVES@O...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;This implies that a &quot;complete chromatic scale&quot; has 21 tones per<br/>&gt; &gt;octave -- a rather odd definition!
