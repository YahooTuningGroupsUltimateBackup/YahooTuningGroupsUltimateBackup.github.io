I did that because<br/>Woolhouse specifically states that the &apos;octave&apos; is always to be a 1:2<br/>ratio.</p><p>[Paul Erlich:]<br/>&gt; Seems to me like &apos;tET&apos; would be better then, since &apos;tET&apos;s always<br/>assume a 1:2 octave, at least around here (where we discuss such<br/>things as 27.35-tET).</p><p>Just thought that I&apos;d add that I originally started using EDO (equally<br/>divided octave) because I was personally dissatisfied with how the &quot;T&quot;<br/>in &quot;ET&quot; was historically and (lacking a better term) politically tied<br/>to twelve-tone equal temperament (or twelve-tone equal temperament<br/>specifically, and tempering in general)... the &quot;T&quot; in &quot;ET&quot;  had a lot<br/>of baggage that didn&apos;t always seem to be a good match for what I was<br/>trying to say or do... equally divided octave just seemed to me to be<br/>a better overall fit: more specific, more neutral... and while I tend<br/>to agree with Paul that it really is pretty clear that &quot;tET&apos;s always<br/>assume a 1:2 octave&quot; (and I use &quot;e&quot; as both a less cumbersome<br/>abbreviation of EDO and as an assumption of the &quot;O&quot; in EDO), I also<br/>think that if &quot;27.35-tET&quot; really is supposed to be saying a 3/2<br/>divided into 16 equal parts -- or something else as specific as<br/>that -- then some easy to decipher shorthand that says just that would<br/>be preferable... perhaps something like (2:3 / 16)e, though I really<br/>haven&apos;t given it a lot of thought... I guess I&apos;d say that the ideal<br/>(for me) &apos;equal tag&apos; would be one that is flexible (so as to cover<br/>exceptions, like the octave assumption for instance), specific (so as<br/>to bypass the accumulation of rounding errors and whatnot), and easy<br/>to decipher (so it can be quickly memorized and internalized).</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=7164 href="#7164">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@xx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/1999 9:00:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, 21 Dec 1999 00:59:47 -0800, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:stearns@capecod.net">stearns@capecod.net</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;Just thought that I&apos;d add that I originally started using EDO (equally<br/>&gt;divided octave) because I was personally dissatisfied with how the &quot;T&quot;<br/>&gt;in &quot;ET&quot; was historically and (lacking a better term) politically tied<br/>&gt;to twelve-tone equal temperament (or twelve-tone equal temperament<br/>&gt;specifically, and tempering in general)...</p><p>I just think of the &quot;T&quot; in &quot;ET&quot; as standing for &quot;tuning&quot;.<br/>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=7165 href="#7165">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/1999 12:23:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Herman Miller:]<br/>&gt;I just think of the &quot;T&quot; in &quot;ET&quot; as standing for &quot;tuning&quot;.</p><p>Well I like the sounds of that better as well, and if that were it&apos;s<br/>standard meaning (or implication) then I guess I&apos;d have little to<br/>squawk about (except perhaps it&apos;s vagueness, or lack of<br/>specificness)...</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=7191 href="#7191">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Actually, saying<br/>&quot;15-equal, 23-equal&quot; (which might be abbreviated 15EQ, 23EQ) is probably<br/>good enough. But I&apos;ve always used &quot;equal tuning&quot; to describe scales like<br/>13-note per octave equal tuning, so the possible ambiguity of ET (out of<br/>context) doesn&apos;t bother me.<br/>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div>
