Beautiful.  I&apos;m not<br/>sure they have so much to do with my actual composition process...<br/>but so what...</p><p>ANYWAY... what happened regarding the &quot;auditioning&quot; process of the<br/>scales is the following:</p><p>I had selected my MIDI IN port, but I never selected the &quot;Open Now&quot;<br/>option.  I guess I ASSUMED that the port would open automatically...</p><p>That&apos;s why I could never hear the keyboard, and I didn&apos;t know that I<br/>could &quot;audition&quot; Scala files.</p><p>Well, you might want to make that an automatic function... because<br/>I&apos;m not entirely convinced that I&apos;m more confused than the average<br/>bear... although it&apos;s quite possible.</p><p>Anyway... it&apos;s working right now!  I&apos;m playing the synth keyboard<br/>with my &quot;other hand&quot; right at this instant...</p><p>________ ___ __ __ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
