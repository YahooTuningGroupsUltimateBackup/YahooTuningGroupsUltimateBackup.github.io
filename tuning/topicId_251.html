Please note<br/>that although the term &quot;just intonation&quot; often implies 5-limit or<br/>above, in my view Pythagorean tuning is a system of just intonation<br/>not only in its basing all intervals on integer ratios, but in some of<br/>its musical qualities.</p><p>First of all, I&apos;d like to offer what may be the most important point<br/>in this article: comparisons between Pythagorean and 1/4-comma<br/>meantone, for example, are likely to reflect the differences between<br/>the styles of music conducive to either tuning.</p><p>In a European concept, this difference might be summed up by the<br/>adjectives &quot;trinic&quot; and &quot;triadic.&quot; In trinic music (c. 1200-1420), the<br/>three-note combination of octave, fifth, and upper fourth<br/>(e.g. d-a-d&apos;) sets the standard of stable saturation, and Pythagorean<br/>tuning permits a just tuning for such sonorities. In triadic music<br/>(c. 1520-1900, with 1680 or marking the transition for stringed<br/>keyboard instruments from meantone toward well-temperaments), the<br/>combination of fifth, major third, and upper minor third similarly<br/>sets the standard of complete harmony, and 1/4-comma meantone<br/>optimizes the prime interval of the major third.</p><p>Note that the period of around 1420-1520 is transitional, although<br/>meantone evidently starts coming into widespread use around<br/>1450-1480. This is one historical case where tuning and musical style<br/>seem to coevolve in a rather closely linked way.</p><p>Anyway, Pythagorean intonation or 3-limit JI seems to me parallel to<br/>5-limit JI (approximated to some extent by 1/4-comma meantone) in<br/>these ways:</p><p>(1) The most favored intervals, in this case fifths (3:2) and fourths<br/>(4:3), are pure, optimizing the complete trine (2:3:4), just as<br/>5-limit JI optimizes the most favored intervals of the major third<br/>(5:4) and minor third (6:5), and thus the complete triad (4:5:6).</p><p>(2) In Pythagorean JI, the mildest unstable intervals, &quot;imperfectly<br/>concordant&quot; or _relatively_ blending major thirds (81:64) and minor<br/>thirds (32:27) are somewhat more acoustically tense than the 5:4 and<br/>6:5 ratios of 5-limit. Similarly, in 5-limit JI, what might be<br/>considered among the mildest of the unstable intervals, the minor<br/>seventh (9:5), is likewise rather more tense than the 7:4 tuning of<br/>7-limit.</p><p>(3) In Pythagorean JI, a diminished fourth or &quot;schisma major third&quot; at<br/>8192:6561 (e.g. e-ab) is curiously only a schisma of 32805:32768 or<br/>about 1.95 cents from a pure 5:4; and likewise an augmented second or<br/>&quot;schisma minor third&quot; at 19683:16384 (e.g. db-e) in relation to a pure<br/>6:5. In 1/4-comma meantone, likewise, an augmented sixth (e.g. eb-c#&apos;)<br/>is only about 3.04 cents from a pure 7:4.</p><p>To state these features in more aesthetic terms, JI systems<br/>(Pythagorean and other) often tend to accentuate the contrast between<br/>stable and unstable intervals: Pythagorean thirds and 5-limit minor<br/>sevenths are somewhat less &quot;concordant&quot; than in 5-limit and 7-limit<br/>tunings respectively. Music conceived for these systems often makes<br/>the most of this contrast: 13th-14th century cadences exploit the<br/>tension of thirds leading to unisons or fifths, for example, while<br/>16th-17th century music intended for 5-limit JI or meantone often<br/>exploits the tension of sevenths, whether in the more subtle<br/>suspensions of usual 16th-century style or in the bolder seventh<br/>sonorities coming into vogue around the end of the century<br/>(e.g. Monteverdi, Gesualdo).</p><p>In addition to this kind of obvious contrast, the schisma or similar<br/>intervals can also invite &quot;special effects&quot; in certain epochs. Thus in<br/>early 15th-century music, realizing major thirds as diminished fourths<br/>leads to a strikingly new sound for at least some sonorities involving<br/>sharp. My own tendency at the keyboard is to play cadential thirds and<br/>sixths in the usual tuning (e.g. e-g#-c#&apos;), but prolonged noncadential<br/>thirds as schisma intervals (e.g. e-ab-b). This is just one of the<br/>possible interpretations, and at any rate _could_ be the way that some<br/>performers might have made use of the 17-note Pythagorean tuning<br/>described by some theorists of the epoch.</p><p>Likewise, as Dave Hill has demonstrated with pianos tuned in 1/4-comma<br/>meantone, the near-7:4 augmented sixth (e.g. eb-c#&apos;) can be a valuable<br/>resource for certain Blues settings, for example. There&apos;s some<br/>evidence, I hear tell, that certain 17th-century composers may have<br/>also experimented with this effect.</p><p>These kinds of intonational possibilities, of course, can invite new<br/>tunings devised to make such &quot;special effects&quot; routinely available at<br/>most or all scale positions. Thus it appears that the schisma thirds<br/>of the early 15th century whetted an appetite which could only be<br/>satisfied by something like the &quot;5-limit-like&quot; meantone temperaments<br/>of the later part of the century and after. Likewise, although I&apos;m not<br/>sure of a historical example, I can imagine how someone experimenting<br/>with the augmented sixths on a 1/4-comma meantone keyboard might<br/>develop a craving for 7-limit JI.</p><p>In European music, at least, this kind of evolution may correlate with<br/>a general axiom: &quot;One era&apos;s dissonant interval or combination will be<br/>regarded as mildly unstable in the next, fully concordant in the one<br/>after that, and &grave;rather incomplete and empty&apos; in the next yet era.&quot;</p><p>Note that one could call this either &quot;progress&quot; or &quot;degeneration,&quot; but<br/>I would simply call it artistic change.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
