Listening to the ET<br/>&gt;version after one on the Prelleur temperament is enlightening, to say<br/>&gt;the least.</p><p>jdl writes:<br/>&gt;&gt; BTW, could you<br/>give the numbers on the Prelleur temperament?&gt;&gt;</p><p>Greetings,<br/>   Jorgensen give the following cents deviations from ET.<br/>A  =0<br/>A#  = + 4.3<br/>B  =   -1.6<br/>C  = + 4.3<br/>C#  =  -.4<br/>D  =  + 1.6<br/>D#  = + 3.1<br/>E  = -.4<br/>F  =  + 5.3<br/>F#  = -.8<br/>G   = +2.3<br/>G# =  +1.2</p><p>This temperament is listed as one of the earliest refinements of<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s rules.  I suppose it would have been in use during Mozart&apos;s<br/>time.  Published in 1731, it reaches its limit of &quot;expression&quot; in C#  with a<br/>tonic third of 19.5 cents. F-A is its best third, creating &quot;home&quot; key of F<br/>(ala Valotti), as opposed to  C.   The difference is slight, since the C-E<br/>third is tempered only 1 cent wider than F-A.<br/>    We used this tuning because it is from the era, it is not any radical<br/>departure from numerous other non restrictive tunings of the time, and<br/>because it is slightly assymetrical.  The graphs that accompany the CD<br/>demonstrate a comparison of the thirds, and the thirds in the keys of F, C,<br/>G, D, A, suffer less tempering than the remaining ones. Normal for the well<br/>tempered keyboard and producing quite a sense of color in Mozart.<br/>   Our comparison allows  several approaches.  In the normal tracks of &quot;Six<br/>Degrees&quot;   the Prelleur Mozart follows a 1/4 comma Scarlatti piece.  In the<br/>separate comparison tracks, that same Prelleur Mozart follows 1/4 comma<br/>Mozart!  The physical sensation of tempering becomes readily apparent when<br/>the piece is the same.<br/>  I wish it were available now, but anybody that has ever dealt with a record<br/>company knows I can&apos;t say when,  I am praying by December 1.<br/>Regards,<br/>ED Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div>
