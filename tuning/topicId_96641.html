This fractured nature means<br/>that there will be more than one subset of the scale which is coherent<br/>and &quot;wind chimes&quot;-y, so you can have more than one tonal center and<br/>hence stuff like chord progressions.</p><p>So in this paradigm, the &quot;fractured&quot; thing and the &quot;wind chimes&quot; thing<br/>couldn&apos;t really happen at the same time, since a scale can&apos;t be both<br/>fractured and homogenous. It can be only kind of fractured, but you<br/>are pointing out that mohajira has characteristics of both. Since<br/>perhaps your paradigm makes more sense, what do you see the<br/>fundamental property of &quot;albitonic&quot; scales as being?
