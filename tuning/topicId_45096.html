In exchange I can say that I follow, without further checking,<br/>your analysis of the meaning of the occasional extra characters that are<br/>added to the tone names on the bells. Your result that C (&quot;gong&quot;) probably<br/>is the principal tone name of the tone-name system that was applied in the<br/>bell inscriptions agrees with what I read in the literature.</p><p>I am glad that you agree that this fact need not be relevant for the tuning<br/>of the bells. One can have a bell ensemble with D as the main tone, and F as<br/>the norm tone, in a C-based name system. It is like having a clarinet in Bb,<br/>tuned to a norm tone A, playing in a C-based name system.</p><p>Perhaps we can come to an agreement as to your other questions as well.<br/>1) Is there a standard scale?<br/>2) If yes, is there a main tone of the scale?<br/>3) Is there a norm tone?<br/>4) Is the tuning fifth/fourth based or octave based?<br/>5) Is one of the three sections of the 33 melody bells (10+12+11) a<br/>multi-octave instrument (2.5 or 3 octaves), or is it an additive<br/>single-octave instrument.</p><p>1) Is there a standard scale?<br/>DEFGAC is repeated 8 times. No other possibility comes close to this.</p><p>2) If yes, is there a main tone of the scale?<br/>For physical and physiological reasons, the lowest tone of a scale has a<br/>natural dominance. It is D in this case.</p><p>3) Is there a norm tone?<br/>If a fixed standard tone is used to tune the instruments of an ensemble, the<br/>least tuning variance in the ensemble must occur at this tone. It is F in<br/>this case. Because the small variance at F is also statistically<br/>significant, on has to conclude that a norm tone was most probably used and<br/>that it was F.</p><p>Additional evidence on issues (2) and (3):<br/>- The interval D-F clearly is the one that is most precisely tuned (see<br/>table B).<br/>- D is the middle of CGDAE. The &quot;middle&quot; (zhong) is one of the main terms in<br/>Chinese thinking. It is the fifth geographical direction, and it appears in<br/>one of the two characters for the Chinese name of China (zhong guo), which<br/>means &quot;land (or realm) of the middle&quot;.</p><p>4) Is the tuning fifth/fourth based or octave based?<br/>A fifth/fourth based tuning, also called Pythagorean, is easy to detect<br/>because of the terrible thirds (408 and 294 Cent). There is no trace of it<br/>in the bell data. The tables show that the tuning is octave based and that<br/>within the octaves the tuning focus is on thirds.</p><p>5) Is one of the three sections of the 33 melody bells (10+12+11) a<br/>multi-octave instrument (2.5 or 3 octaves), or is it an additive<br/>single-octave instrument.<br/>Acoustically, bells are not useful for fast, dancing, or party music, where<br/>players could be permitted to jump around between the bells. But they are<br/>very useful for serious music, where players have to stay put at their<br/>position. In Gamelan music players sit, and they do not rock around to reach<br/>far-off keys. As I saw in film material of a test performance with the<br/>original bells, one non-jumping player can best handle three of the melody<br/>bells, which in most cases amounts to one octave. Also note that the bells<br/>have to be struck far more precisely than Gamelan keys. If one player can<br/>best handle an octave section of an instrument, the instrument is an<br/>additive single-octave one. This is what we see with Gamelan instruments in<br/>Indonesia and perhaps also with marimbas in Central America.</p><p>Martin</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2003 9:14:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Martin Braun&quot; &lt;nombraun@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>...<br/>&gt; Perhaps we can come to an agreement as to your other questions as well.<br/>...</p><p>Dear Martin,</p><p>I would prefer if you would respond to all the actual questions I<br/>asked and points I made in<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/45708">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/45708</a><br/>rather than selecting a few and attributing to me some others that I<br/>did not ask.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Martin Braun &#x3C;nombraun@telia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2003 5:27:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Dave,</p><p>I had summed up your questions, because multiple interleaving becomes<br/>difficult to read.

When you do not assume any intention to<br/>&gt; &gt; tune octaves to a precise 1:2 ratio and compare, between sets, only the<br/>&gt; &gt; same note in the same octave, you find that there is no clear winner for<br/>&gt; &gt; the title of &quot;norm tone&quot;. Of those pitches which occur in all three<br/>sets,<br/>&gt; &gt; G4 has the lowest variance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, I did assume the intention to tune 1:2 octaves, because they had<br/>&gt;large<br/>&gt;zithers, which yield very precise octaves.</p><p>I don&apos;t see what that has got to do with it. Perhaps they did not _want_<br/>1:2 octaves for the bells. Perhaps they found that the bells sound better<br/>if you tune the octaves a little wider than the octaves obtained using<br/>string harmonics, as is the case with gamelan. Indonesians have stringed<br/>instruments too but choose to widen the octaves for their metallophones.</p><p>But as I pointed out, there is no need to assume any particular intended<br/>octave size, just don&apos;t octave reduce anything before looking at means and<br/>variances.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Given the names inscribed on the bells, it seems likely to me that any<br/>&gt; &gt; standard tuning note (norm tone), if it exists, would be one we&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; translated as C, G, D, or A since these are the names that do not<br/>&gt;consist<br/>&gt; &gt; of a suffix added to the name of another note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Other scholars were convinced that C was the main tone of the system,<br/>&gt;relying on music theoretical fragments.</p><p>Now that you have sent me the scanned tables showing the Chinese characters<br/>for the notes, it is also reasonably obvious to me that C is the main tone.<br/>i.e. it is the most common tonic (or ending note). This doesn&apos;t necessarily<br/>make it the tuning standard. But that would seem most likely, if there<br/>_was_ a tuning standard. But I see no evidence for a tuning standard in the<br/>pitch data.</p><p>The Chinese pitch names are not as simple as you have indicated in your<br/>article. There are 3 other characters which apparently indicate the<br/>register or octave in terms of the physical size of the bell. Two of them<br/>mean &quot;small&quot; (the TF character) and &quot;smaller than small&quot; (the penguin<br/>skiing character) which seem to be used for progressively higher octaves<br/>(but not in the same pitch class), and the other apparently means<br/>&quot;opposite&quot; (the square root of X-bar character) and is less clear. These<br/>are used in conjunction with the single characters for CGDA. They are not<br/>used with F, or any other note name that already has two characters, with<br/>one exception. This is presumably because 3 characters would be<br/>unacceptable. 3 character note names do not occur anywhere in the scanned<br/>tables.</p><p>The exception is E. Even though the chinese name for E already has two<br/>characters, meaning &quot;major-third from C&quot;, in four cases the octave<br/>modifiers are added to it and the character referring to C is dropped. So<br/>they effectively read &quot;octave above major third&quot; and &quot;two-octvaes above<br/>major third&quot;. But an octave above a major third above what? I figure the<br/>&quot;C&quot; can only be omitted because it is the tonic.</p><p>The other thing is that the character for C literally translates as<br/>&quot;palace&quot;. The palace is the centre of the kingdom, it sets the standards<br/>(makes the laws), all roads lead there.</p><p>On that basis, I suspect the primary pentatonic mode was CDEGAC.</p><p>I&apos;m unsure about some of the other characters, because the printing or<br/>scanning is unclear. It would be good to have actual photos of the<br/>inscriptions. But I can&apos;t find anything among their possible literal<br/>meanings that is even remotely as suggestive of a tonic as is &quot;palace&quot;,<br/>except perhaps &quot;to weave or knit&quot; for G, although the zhi character with<br/>that meaning was not the best match. The one with the &quot;fine, delicate&quot;<br/>meaning looks closer.</p><p>I have found the following possibilities at<br/><a href="http://www.zhongwen.com/">http://www.zhongwen.com/</a></p><p>C gong palace<br/>G zhi to weave or knit, lance+sound, watchtower, fine, delicate<br/>D shang discuss, trade, business, commerce, merchant<br/>A yu feather, wing</p><p>&gt; It is very common, however, that<br/>&gt;names and theory differ from practice (just think of the &quot;western&quot; seven<br/>&gt;letters for 12 tones).</p><p>I don&apos;t understand your point here. Clearly the main tone in western<br/>tunings _is_ one that is named with a single character with no modifiers<br/>(sharp or flat), as the Chinese name for F does not.</p><p>&gt; I tried to write down musical practice as<br/>&gt;visible in<br/>&gt;the data.</p><p>This is a laudable aim. But I hope you understand now that you have made an<br/>unwarranted and unnecessary assumption and so your calculations are not<br/>valid.</p><p>&gt; &gt; By the way, you should have translated gong zeng, zhi zeng, shang<br/>&gt;zeng as<br/>&gt; &gt; Ab, Eb and Bb, not G# D# and A#, so that all the nominal(in chinese)<br/>&gt;thirds<br/>&gt; &gt; would also be spelled as such in western notation (i.e. as thirds, not<br/>&gt; &gt; diminished fourths).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&quot;Diminished fourths&quot; only occur in the theory of the so-called &quot;tonal&quot;<br/>&gt;style of European music.</p><p>This is not relevant.</p><p>&gt; In contexts of 12-tone descriptions it is now well<br/>&gt;established to use only the # for the five &quot;accidentals&quot;.</p><p>This is only true of 12-tone _equal_tempered_ situations when there is no<br/>particular tonal centre and no consonant intervals being discussed. And<br/>even then it is also quite common to use EbBbFCGDAEBF#C#G# as the default<br/>rather than FCGDAEBF#C#G#D#A#. That is not the case here. Correct spelling<br/>of intervals is important.</p><p>For you to use G# D# and A# for what, in the Chinese, are clearly &quot;major<br/>third below&quot; (or &quot;minor sixth above&quot;) C G and D, is a travesty. It amounts<br/>to an unwarranted assumption of 12-tone-equal-temperament before you even<br/>start.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I find no evidence there that fifths are narrowed, or fourths<br/>&gt;widened, to<br/>&gt; &gt; favour thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, the fourths according to your method are widened.</p><p>The amount is not significant given the huge variance.</p><p>&gt; I rejected your<br/>&gt;method, however. I knew it from Andr&iuml;&iquest;&half; Lehr in the Netherlands. The<br/>&gt;bells do<br/>&gt;not represent a system that is based on intervals that cross the octave<br/>&gt;borders, like our piano. They are for octave confined music, just like the<br/>&gt;gamelan instruments,</p><p>What evidence do you have for this?</p><p>*** See yesterday&apos;s post.***</p><p>And if it is so, which octaves are we confined to, G to G, C to C, D to D?<br/>And how do you know.</p><p>*** See yesterday&apos;s post. The backbone octave of the ensemble is a<br/>non-closed one. It is D to C.***</p><p>&gt;because one player only has one octave in the reach of his hands.</p><p>What does it matter if it is played by one player or three, what has that<br/>got to do with the issue of how to calculate mean interval sizes?</p><p>*** See yesterday&apos;s post. A melodic phrase can best be played by one player,<br/>rather than by several interleaving players. What one player has in his/her<br/>hands tells us which intervals are most relevant to examine.***</p><p>*** See yesterday&apos;s post. I considered the intervals in the DEFGAC frame,<br/>because it is the obvious backbone of the ensemble. Concerning all other<br/>intervals, we only know that they must have been of secondary importance, if<br/>they were of any importance at all.***</p><p>If I am including intervals that cross these imagined octave boundaries,<br/>then so are you.</p><p>It seems from the photographs that a single player could easily span any<br/>fifth with two hands. But I do not see this as relevant anyway. Both notes<br/>of a fifth may never be played simultaneously and this would not affect my<br/>point about how to calculate their mean size.</p><p>&gt; Here, as in Gamelan, we have within-octave intervals and<br/>&gt;across-octave chroma consistency. Circles of fifths and fourths, or<br/>&gt;parts of<br/>&gt;it, do not seem appropriate to describe these instruments and their music.</p><p>How do you know this?</p><p>*** See yesterday&apos;s post on the absence of Pythagorean tuning.***</p><p> It certainly isn&apos;t in the data or photographs.</p><p>&gt;The term mean-tone tuning only makes sense in a 12-tone instrument.</p><p>Perhaps that is so for the literal meaning of &quot;mean tone&quot;, but not for the<br/>tempering principle that has come to be known as meantone temperament. This<br/>can be applied to a chain of only four fifths (5 notes) and is simply the<br/>principle of narrowing the fifths from 2:3 to bring the major and minor<br/>thirds closer to 4:5 and 5:6. This is what you are claiming the Zeng bells<br/>are doing for CGDAE.</p><p>&gt;What the<br/>&gt;Chinese had 2000 years before the Europeans was a tuning focus on the<br/>&gt;thirds at the cost of the fifths.</p><p>I disagree. I don&apos;t see any cost to the fifths, if anything the cost falls<br/>on the octaves and fourths. But the tuning errors are so huge it is<br/>ridiculous to draw any such conclusions.</p><p>&gt; &gt; How one can conclude anything from a nominally 12-note tuning where<br/>&gt; &gt; interval sizes vary +-50 cents, I&apos;m not sure. But if it can be said to<br/>&gt; &gt; approximate any kind of regular tuning, I&apos;d have to say it looks like a<br/>&gt; &gt; incredibly badly tuned 12 note equal division of a stretched octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They are &quot;incredibly badly tuned&quot;, if you apply this standards of<br/>&gt;multi-octave string instruments. If you apply the standards of<br/>&gt;metallophones, with their non-harmonic - but potentially very<br/>&gt;interesting -<br/>&gt;sound spectra, and the standards of musical practice of Gamelan<br/>&gt;instruments,<br/>&gt;the bells represent sufficiently balanced tuning compromises between scale<br/>&gt;precision and pleasant timbres.</p><p>But aren&apos;t you claiming that when struck in the right place there is very<br/>little inharmonicity in the bell tones?</p><p>*** No. When struck in the right place, A and B tones are well separated,<br/>but the spectrum of each of them always has both harmonic and non-harmonic<br/>components. See the spectral analyses concerning the original bells on my<br/>web site.***</p><p>Even if the inharmonicity _is_ responsible, surely you&apos;re not seriously<br/>claiming that those +-50 cent errors are _meant_ to be there. I&apos;m afraid<br/>this just doesn&apos;t hold water. How do you explain the enormous variations<br/>between what are presumably bell cast from the same mold, in different sets?</p><p>*** I know of no evidence that they were cast from the same molds. Some<br/>researchers think that they were cast at different times, or even at<br/>different places (as is possible with different Gamalan instruments of one<br/>ensemble, as well). But, obviously, they were integrated in one unitary rack<br/>and reflect the same tuning objectives.***</p><p>I suggest that either their casting was very inaccurate and they had no way<br/>of tuning the bells after casting, or 2,400 years has taken its toll (pun<br/>intended).</p><p>Either way, I think the claims you are making cannot be supported by the<br/>data, because of the uncertainty caused by these huge variations.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You say &quot;it is obvious that the tuning focus was on pure thirds, not on<br/>&gt; &gt; pure fifths&quot;. But I&apos;d say it was treating thirds and fifths<br/>&gt;approximately<br/>&gt; &gt; as equals. However, given that the bells tend to have an approximate<br/>&gt;third<br/>&gt; &gt; among their partials, tuning these so that an individual bell sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonious when both of its notes sound simultaneously will force them<br/>&gt; &gt; towards either a 4:5 or 5:6 ratio, and so even if the emphasis for the<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning _between_ bells is entirely on the fourths and fifths, you would<br/>&gt;end<br/>&gt; &gt; up with a tuning that appeared to favour minor and major thirds as<br/>&gt;much as<br/>&gt; &gt; fourths and fifths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In octave confined music you simply have more thirds than fourths and<br/>&gt;fifths. The data reflect that the bell casters cared more about the thirds<br/>&gt;in the octave frame.</p><p>I&apos;ll await evidence of this &quot;octave frame&quot; before I comment on this.</p><p>&gt;I think it should be clear from the context of the paper that we are<br/>&gt;dealing<br/>&gt;with a material 6-tone scale, not with a 6-tone scale in musical<br/>&gt;practice.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid I did not find that clear. But I&apos;m glad you agree. However there<br/>is still the possibility that the F was not used any more often than say<br/>the B, and just happens to occur in every octave because you have to put<br/>_something_ on the D bell.</p><p>&gt;I wrote about this at length in a reply to one of Kraig&apos;s posts.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry I missed that.</p><p>&gt; There is a<br/>&gt;possibly corresponding case in Gamelan pelog of Java, where the material<br/>&gt;scale always has seven tones in the octave, whereas the three modes<br/>&gt;that are<br/>&gt;used in pelog only select five of them, and different ones depending on<br/>&gt;mode.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Notice that the pentatonics can be played with pitch strictly increasing<br/>&gt; &gt; from right to left, whereas the hexatonic would require a<br/>&gt;counter-intuitive<br/>&gt; &gt; reversal of direction between E and F.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Good point. But for settings with one player per octave (mostly only 3<br/>&gt;bells), such a reversal would not have been much of a problem.</p><p>What evidence have you for one player per octave?</p><p>*** See yesterday&apos;s post.***</p><p>&gt; &gt; Your data does show a bell with 342 cents between its two notes (the<br/>&gt;D5-F5<br/>&gt; &gt; bell in set I) but interestingly, on your data tables page you do not<br/>&gt; &gt; suggest that either of its two notes are mistuned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Good point. In the table only assumed mistuning re ensemble is marked, not<br/>&gt;bell-internal one. The bell possibly was accepted and not melted down and<br/>&gt;re-cast, because it still fitted into the chroma scale of the ensemble, as<br/>&gt;shown in data table A.</p><p>Possibly.</p><p>&gt; &gt; With regard to what is mistuned and what isn&apos;t. The only place that we<br/>&gt; &gt; agree that something is very wrong is in the low octave of set two,<br/>&gt;where<br/>&gt; &gt; we find only 14 cents separating Bb from B.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This supports the view that the six &quot;accidentals&quot; were second-class<br/>&gt;passengers in the ensemble.</p><p>It only supports the view that Bb was a second-class passenger, or that<br/>2,400 years underwater and underground is a long time.</p><p>***The time was physically irrelevant for the state of conservation. The<br/>crystalline structure of bronze does not change between a few years and<br/>thousands of years.

I find it extraordinary that you assume an<br/>intention to tune 1200 cent octaves based on no evidence whatsoever. And<br/>you ignore the contrary evidence of the gamelan practice of stretching the<br/>octaves, while being quite happy to cite other gamelan practices as<br/>evidence for other hypotheses.</p><p>I must insist that the only meaningful way to calculate mean interval sizes<br/>is not to assume _anything_ about the intended octave size, but to first<br/>calculate the actual interval sizes _within_ each octave of each set, and<br/>then calculate their mean.</p><p>The following is a complete list of the nominal intervals within your<br/>proposed scale, that do not cross your proposed octave boundaries:</p><p>                    Qty  Mean  Std-dev  Qty on a single bell<br/>                       (cents) (cents)<br/>semitones      E:F   8    120     26<br/>wholetones     D:E   8    200     23<br/>               F:G   8    184     12<br/>               G:A   9    202     30<br/>minor thirds   D:F   8    320     14     8<br/>               E:G   8    303     27     6<br/>               A:C   9    310     15     6<br/>major thirds   F:A   8    384     27<br/>fourths        D:G   8    503      8<br/>               E:A   8    504     24<br/>               G:C   9    511     29<br/>fifths         D:A   8    704     33<br/>               F:C   8    696     28<br/>minor sixths   E:C   8    815     22<br/>minor sevenths D:C   8   1015     32</p><p>Do you dispute these results?

Also<br/>that those with the smallest deviation are most likely to be the closest to<br/>their _intended_ tuning. I don&apos;t have a problem with these assumptions,<br/>only with your failure to carry them through consistently by not assuming<br/>an octave size that is not given to you by the data.</p><p>The above results do not show &quot;a norm tone of F4 ~ 345 Hz&quot;.</p><p>We see that the interval with the lowest deviation by far is the D:G<br/>fourth, suggesting that one of these two notes is most likely to be the<br/>starting point for the tuning. F is only third in line, on this analysis.<br/>Your low deviation for the F &quot;chroma&quot; is merely an artifact of your<br/>unwarranted assumption of a 1200 cent octave. Of the octave-specific<br/>pitches that occur in all three sets, G4 has the lowest standard deviation<br/>(4 cents).</p><p>The above results do not show &quot;a third-oriented tuning with equally<br/>tempered fifths (~696 Cent) in the series CGDAE&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure how to make _any_ sense of this claim when you deny the<br/>relevance of the fifths C:G, G:D and A:E (because they cross the octave<br/>boundary), except to suppose that you are so immersed in the assumption of<br/>1200 cent octave-equivalence that you consider these to be equivalent to<br/>the remainder out of 1200 cents, of the fourths G:C, D:G and E:A. But such<br/>&quot;remainder fifths&quot; do not actually exist anywhere in the bell tuning. They<br/>are, like the F4 norm tone, an artifact of your unwarranted assumption of<br/>1200 cent octaves.</p><p>Here are the actual C:G, G:D and A:E fifths, which cross your octave boundary,<br/>                    Qty  Mean  Std-dev  Qty on a single bell<br/>                       (cents) (cents)<br/>fifths         C:G   6    700     20<br/>               G:D   6    705     15<br/>               A:E   6    706     28</p><p>The results suggest equal importance for (very approximately) justly<br/>intoned minor thirds and fifths, and provide no evidence whatsoever for any<br/>tempering of the fifths.

The individual bells are tuned by aiming for a 5:6<br/>ratio between their two main frequencies (E:G, A:C, D:F). Then the tuning<br/>_between_ bells is aimed at 2:3 ratios for C:G, G:D, and D:A, the four<br/>notes that are always named without reference to any others (gong, zhi,<br/>shang, yu).</p><p>This automatically results in a 4:5 ratio for the F:A and C:E major thirds.</p><p>It is more difficult to explain how the tempering was acheived, but it was<br/>probably aimed at approximately equalising the wholetones D:E, G:A, C:D and<br/>F:G at around 193 cents rather than the fourths at 509 cents or the octaves<br/>at 1211 cents. But once the syntonic commas are distributed over these<br/>wholetones, the stretched fourths and octaves will be the automatic result<br/>(given the Just minor thirds and fifths).</p><p>Perhaps a more complete description will explained why some of the<br/>wholetones are closer to a 9:10 (182 c) minor wholetone and some are closer<br/>to an 8:9 (204 c) major wholetone, but given the deviations, the suggestion<br/>of a target of 193 cents for all of them seems quite reasonable.</p><p>Here&apos;s the wholetone we haven&apos;t looked at so far, because it crosses your<br/>octave boundary.</p><p>                    Qty  Mean  Std-dev  Qty on a single bell<br/>                       (cents) (cents)<br/>wholetone      C:D   6    196     20</p><p>Is this anything like how Andr&eacute; Lehr describes the tuning?</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/</a></p></div><h3>Martin Braun &#x3C;nombraun@telia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2003 12:37:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; Dear Martin,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The main remaining issue I have with your paper is one that I have raised<br/>&gt; several times but you have not really addressed, except to say:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I rejected your method, however.

And<br/>&gt; you ignore the contrary evidence of the gamelan practice of stretching the<br/>&gt; octaves, while being quite happy to cite other gamelan practices as<br/>&gt; evidence for other hypotheses.</p><p>Dear Dave,</p><p>there is sufficient evidence to assume that the bell casters worked from a<br/>concept of an octave of 1200 Cent.</p><p>1) As opposed to the Gamelan practice, the apparent octave stretching in the<br/>bell tuning is small and inconsistent. The most cautious assumption that is<br/>possible from the data is that all deviations from an octave of 1200 Cent,<br/>in either direction, are accidental and not tuned on purpose.</p><p>2) The scale DEFGAC of the bell ensemble obviously is a tempered one. It<br/>reveals a balancing of thirds, fourths, and fifths. A temperament of this<br/>type, for an ensemble of 66 tones, can only be achieved, if there is a<br/>tuning template. It must have been realized either on a string instrument or<br/>on<br/>an instrument that had been tuned from a string instrument. Only string<br/>instruments allow the repeated alteration between exact and detuned thirds,<br/>which is necessary for this type of temperament. Octaves on string<br/>instruments, then, are very close to 1200 Cent.</p><p>&gt; I must insist that the only meaningful way to calculate mean interval<br/>sizes<br/>&gt; is not to assume _anything_ about the intended octave size, but to first<br/>&gt; calculate the actual interval sizes _within_ each octave of each set, and<br/>&gt; then calculate their mean.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The following is a complete list of the nominal intervals within your<br/>&gt; proposed scale, that do not cross your proposed octave boundaries:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                      Qty  Mean  Std-dev  Qty on a single bell<br/>&gt;                         (cents) (cents)<br/>&gt; semitones      E:F   8    120     26<br/>&gt; wholetones     D:E   8    200     23<br/>&gt;                 F:G   8    184     12<br/>&gt;                 G:A   9    202     30<br/>&gt; minor thirds   D:F   8    320     14     8<br/>&gt;                 E:G   8    303     27     6<br/>&gt;                 A:C   9    310     15     6<br/>&gt; major thirds   F:A   8    384     27<br/>&gt; fourths        D:G   8    503      8<br/>&gt;                 E:A   8    504     24<br/>&gt;                 G:C   9    511     29<br/>&gt; fifths         D:A   8    704     33<br/>&gt;                 F:C   8    696     28<br/>&gt; minor sixths   E:C   8    815     22<br/>&gt; minor sevenths D:C   8   1015     32<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you dispute these results?</p><p>No. I did not check them, though.</p><p>&gt; Some of them are very different from those you base your claims on.</p><p>They are not comparable with my results, and therefore not in conflict with<br/>them.</p><p>&gt; We should really look at _all_ the intervals that occur a significant<br/>&gt; number of times, but for now I&apos;m going along with your octave-confined<br/>&gt; assertion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your basic argument seems to be that the intervals or pitches which are<br/>&gt; tuned most consistently, in all octaves of all sets of bells, are likely<br/>to<br/>&gt; be the most important ones, and the ones the tuning is &quot;based on&quot;. Also<br/>&gt; that those with the smallest deviation are most likely to be the closest<br/>to<br/>&gt; their _intended_ tuning. I don&apos;t have a problem with these assumptions,<br/>&gt; only with your failure to carry them through consistently by not assuming<br/>&gt; an octave size that is not given to you by the data.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The above results do not show &quot;a norm tone of F4 ~ 345 Hz&quot;.</p><p>Because you analyzed intervals, instead of distribution of frequencies of<br/>single tones.</p><p>&gt; We see that the interval with the lowest deviation by far is the D:G<br/>&gt; fourth, suggesting that one of these two notes is most likely to be the<br/>&gt; starting point for the tuning. F is only third in line, on this analysis.<br/>&gt; Your low deviation for the F &quot;chroma&quot; is merely an artifact of your<br/>&gt; unwarranted assumption of a 1200 cent octave. Of the octave-specific<br/>&gt; pitches that occur in all three sets, G4 has the lowest standard deviation<br/>&gt; (4 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The above results do not show &quot;a third-oriented tuning with equally<br/>&gt; tempered fifths (~696 Cent) in the series CGDAE&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure how to make _any_ sense of this claim when you deny the<br/>&gt; relevance of the fifths C:G, G:D and A:E (because they cross the octave<br/>&gt; boundary), except to suppose that you are so immersed in the assumption of<br/>&gt; 1200 cent octave-equivalence that you consider these to be equivalent to<br/>&gt; the remainder out of 1200 cents, of the fourths G:C, D:G and E:A. But such<br/>&gt; &quot;remainder fifths&quot; do not actually exist anywhere in the bell tuning. They<br/>&gt; are, like the F4 norm tone, an artifact of your unwarranted assumption of<br/>&gt; 1200 cent octaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here are the actual C:G, G:D and A:E fifths, which cross your octave<br/>boundary,<br/>&gt;                      Qty  Mean  Std-dev  Qty on a single bell<br/>&gt;                         (cents) (cents)<br/>&gt; fifths         C:G   6    700     20<br/>&gt;                 G:D   6    705     15<br/>&gt;                 A:E   6    706     28<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The results suggest equal importance for (very approximately) justly<br/>&gt; intoned minor thirds and fifths, and provide no evidence whatsoever for<br/>any<br/>&gt; tempering of the fifths. There is however some evidence that some octaves<br/>&gt; and fourths are stretched by approximately 11 cents, thereby distributing<br/>&gt; the syntonic comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s how it works for one octave of the hexatonic (dual overlapping<br/>&gt; pentatonics).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    --------1211------<br/>&gt;   /                  \<br/>&gt; |  E4--509--A4--509--D5<br/>&gt; |    \     / \      /  \<br/>&gt; |   --702--  --702--    \<br/>&gt; |  /   316  /  316      316<br/>&gt; | /     \  /     \        \<br/>&gt; D4--509--G4--509--C5--509--F5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a start at what I find to be a plausible explanation of how the<br/>&gt; tuning has resulted. The individual bells are tuned by aiming for a 5:6<br/>&gt; ratio between their two main frequencies (E:G, A:C, D:F). Then the tuning<br/>&gt; _between_ bells is aimed at 2:3 ratios for C:G, G:D, and D:A, the four<br/>&gt; notes that are always named without reference to any others (gong, zhi,<br/>&gt; shang, yu).</p><p>It would have been a very poor strategy first to tune the bells internally<br/>(5:6 ratio) and then change their tones again to reach further tuning aims.<br/>All filing on the bells had to be minimized as much as possible in order to<br/>keep a well-sounding bell, or one that sounded bell-like att all. As I<br/>explained above, a tuning template for the complete scale of DEFGAC was<br/>mandatory.</p><p>&gt; This automatically results in a 4:5 ratio for the F:A and C:E major<br/>thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is more difficult to explain how the tempering was acheived, but it was<br/>&gt; probably aimed at approximately equalising the wholetones D:E, G:A, C:D<br/>and<br/>&gt; F:G at around 193 cents rather than the fourths at 509 cents or the<br/>octaves<br/>&gt; at 1211 cents. But once the syntonic commas are distributed over these<br/>&gt; wholetones, the stretched fourths and octaves will be the automatic result<br/>&gt; (given the Just minor thirds and fifths).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps a more complete description will explained why some of the<br/>&gt; wholetones are closer to a 9:10 (182 c) minor wholetone and some are<br/>closer<br/>&gt; to an 8:9 (204 c) major wholetone, but given the deviations, the<br/>suggestion<br/>&gt; of a target of 193 cents for all of them seems quite reasonable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s the wholetone we haven&apos;t looked at so far, because it crosses your<br/>&gt; octave boundary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                      Qty  Mean  Std-dev  Qty on a single bell<br/>&gt;                         (cents) (cents)<br/>&gt; wholetone      C:D   6    196     20<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is this anything like how Andr&iuml;&iquest;&half; Lehr describes the tuning?</p><p>His analysis was much less sophisticated than yours.

The syntonic comma (80:81, ~21.5 c) is irrelevant in gamelan. The much larger &quot;major limma&quot; (128:135, ~92 c) may however play a similar role in pelog tunings.</p><p>You have correctly observed that the bell tuning is tempered to distribute the syntonic comma, but you are quite mistaken about _where_ the pieces of the syntonic comma have been put, or in other words _which_intervals_ are tempered. Because you chose, right from the start, to blind yourself to the one possibility which turns out to be true.</p><p>&gt;  The most cautious assumption<br/>&gt;that is<br/>&gt;possible from the data is that all deviations from an octave of 1200 Cent,<br/>&gt;in either direction, are accidental and not tuned on purpose.</p><p>No! The most cautious assumption is no assumption at all! Or to put it another way: Even if that _were_ the most cautious assumption, it is not necessary to make it.</p><p>&gt;2) The scale DEFGAC of the bell ensemble obviously is a tempered one.</p><p>Yes. We certainly agree on that. We even agree on the comma that is being distributed.</p><p>&gt;It reveals a balancing of thirds, fourths, and fifths.</p><p>Yes. And more specifically it reveals the tempering of fourths (or wholetones or octaves) in favour of pure thirds and pure fifths.</p><p>In your abstract you describe the tuning as &quot;third-oriented&quot; and in your conclusion you write &quot;a preference of pure thirds over pure fifths&quot;.</p><p>But there is no evidence whatsoever in the data, of &quot;a preference of pure thirds over pure fifths&quot;. I say again, this is merely an artifact of your unnecessary assumption of 1200 cent octaves. There is however evidence of a preference for pure thirds over pure fourths (and octaves).</p><p>&gt;  A temperament of this<br/>&gt;type, for an ensemble of 66 tones, can only be achieved, if there is a<br/>&gt;tuning template.</p><p>I can go along with that.</p><p>&gt;  It must have been realized either on a string<br/>&gt;instrument or<br/>&gt;on<br/>&gt;an instrument that had been tuned from a string instrument. Only string<br/>&gt;instruments allow the repeated alteration between exact and detuned<br/>&gt;thirds,<br/>&gt;which is necessary for this type of temperament.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t go so far as to say the template can &quot;only&quot; have originated on a string instrument. I can imagine an iterative process of casting and filing and recasting so as to require less filing, and filing, and recasting to require even less filing and so on. However I agree that it would be much easier to first produce the temperament on a string instrument, and so I agree that is probably what happened.</p><p>&gt;  Octaves on string<br/>&gt;instruments, then, are very close to 1200 Cent.</p><p>This makes no sense to me whatsoever. Octaves on a string instrument can be anything you want them to be. Just as you describe detuning thirds above, so the octaves can also be detuned.</p><p>However, I don&apos;t understand why you talk of detuning thirds. I thought we both agreed that the bell tuning appears to be aiming for pure thirds.</p><p>...<br/>&gt; &gt; Do you dispute these results?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No. I did not check them, though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Some of them are very different from those you base your claims on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;They are not comparable with my results, and therefore not in conflict<br/>&gt;with them.</p><p>You claim that the mean sizes of the fifths F:C and D:A are 687.9 c and 697.8 c respectively. I claim that they are 696 c and 704 c respectively (to the nearest cent). How is this &quot;not comparable&quot;. Yours are respectively 8 and 6 cents narrower than mine (to the nearest cent). Similar differences apply to the other fifths and other intervals you give on your data page.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The above results do not show &quot;a norm tone of F4 ~ 345 Hz&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Because you analyzed intervals, instead of distribution of frequencies of<br/>&gt;single tones.</p><p>And why is one method more valid than the other? Possibly because one method does not make any assumptions about intended octave size.</p><p>However, I _did_ also analyse the distribution of frequencies of single tones, and reported my result: &quot;Of the octave-specific pitches that occur in all three sets, G4 has the lowest standard deviation (4 cents).&quot; Again I did not assume any particular intended size for the octaves.</p><p>So F4 loses out by two independent methods when no particular octave size is assumed.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The results suggest equal importance for (very approximately) justly<br/>&gt; &gt; intoned minor thirds and fifths, and provide no evidence whatsoever for<br/>&gt;any<br/>&gt; &gt; tempering of the fifths.

Now Martin says (and I agree) that the<br/>difference between 17.7 c and 19.8 c is not significant, so he must<br/>also agree that the difference between 19.8 c and 21.9 c is not<br/>significant.</p><p>The difference between 21.9 c and 17.7 c might be considered<br/>significant, but the change that occurs here is one of widening the<br/>octaves (or equivalently the wholetones or the fourths) while the<br/>fifths remain pure.</p><p>Assuming it is significant, the reason for widening the octaves would<br/>seem to be to improve the thirds in the scale, however this need not<br/>be the case. Given the size and inconsistency of the errors it would<br/>be difficult to even recognise the impossibility of having all<br/>thirths, fourths, fifths and octaves pure. The tuning may well have<br/>resulted from attempting to tune a Pythagorean scale with pure fifths<br/>as usual, while simultaneously making the individual bells sound as<br/>good as possible (which requires something like pure minor or major<br/>thirds between their two &quot;fundamentals&quot;).</p><p>The distinction I&apos;m trying to make here is between caring which thirds<br/>approach pure based on where they are in the scale, and caring which<br/>approach pure based only on whether they occur on a single bell.</p><p>i.e. if there is a change towards pure thirds it may well have been<br/>&quot;technology driven&quot; rather than &quot;thought driven&quot;. As an example of<br/>this, I just learnt that all those famous ancient greek bronze statues<br/>of the human form that proliferated around 450 to 400 BCE, that were<br/>previously thought to represent a major leap forward in artistic<br/>_thought_ towards greater realism, probably represent &quot;only&quot; a major<br/>leap forward in _technology_, for making molds from actual live humans!</p><p>Apparently someone intimately familiar with both human anatomy and the<br/>technology of mold making and casting noticed the incredibly accurate<br/>detail on the _underside_ of the feet.
