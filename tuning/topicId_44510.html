By the way, this was one of the most *fun*<br/>classes I ever had at school.  It wasn&apos;t just Bassett, the Michigan<br/>composition department always had these seminars on Fridays, the last<br/>thing, maybe from about 3PM to 6PM.  Everybody was in a semi-serious<br/>mood, but there was also the Weekend coming up, and it seemed to add<br/>to an underlying *party* subliminal chord.  That and the fact that<br/>composition was so strong both at that school and in the entire city<br/>of Ann Arbor, among some &quot;anti-academic&quot; composers who just hung<br/>around to make &quot;trouble...&quot;  (That&apos;s, of course where the ONCE group<br/>was started, Gordon Mumma, Bob Ashley, of course, Lucier....)</p><p>Annnnyway, one fellow who had studied at University of Illinois<br/>brough in Partch&apos;s _Genesis of a Music_.  Since I was only in my 20&apos;s<br/>at the time, I knew little about Partch and my first impression was<br/>that he was some kind of &quot;wacko...&quot; (apologies to all...)  However,<br/>we went through the book some at the seminar and I remember being<br/>quite impressed (naturally) by it, and started taking Partch<br/>seriously.</p><p>So, I guess there really *was* something about Tuning at Michigan at<br/>that time... at least in this seminar...</p><p>J.
