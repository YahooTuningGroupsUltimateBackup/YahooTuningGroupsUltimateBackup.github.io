Remember that Tchaikowski&apos;s Symphony No. 6, &quot;Pathetic&quot;, is not in c-minor (as Beethovens Sonata), but in b minor. And you find in (yes, again !) Chopin&apos;s work a lot of pathetic works that are not in c-minor, so you se the tradition had soon come to an end. Why? Because it was the tuning of that time which was at least at Werckmeisters standard.<br/>SORRY:<br/>Sometimes I get the impression that some of the tuning list members try to &quot;retune music history&quot; as a whole instead of searching for new possibilities to add more sounds, chords, contrapunctual and harmonic features to the music we already have.<br/>If I am wrong here, then please let me know. :-(</p><p>As for Chopin: it might of course be interesting what happens to his op. 45 if being played in different tunings...</p><p>Bye<br/>Werner</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2003 4:41:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Wernerlinden@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Sorry, I was brought up with the conception that Werckmeister<br/>&gt; paved the way for 12 tet, and by this enabled, if not inspired,<br/>Bach to create the &quot;Wohltemperierte Klavier&quot; (I dislike the<br/>abbreviation WTC for this work.)</p><p>This doesn&apos;t explain why WTC I is playable in meantone--though if you<br/>refused to retune you&apos;d need to transpose instead.

Murray Barbour to explain modern conclusions about which keys<br/>sound better or worse cannot be based on sustained harmonies as pertains to Bach.<br/> For, &quot;except at a final cadence, Bach usually avoids sustained triads.  Even<br/>subsidiary cadences are often arpeggiated or contain suspensions or other<br/>dissonances&quot; (Barbour, Bach, p. 81).</p><p>The use of internal evidence always implies an interpretation model.  Unless<br/>such a model is given by external evidence, it must be constructed anew by the<br/>20th-century investigator and is bound to be arbitrary (Rasch, &quot;Does&mldr;, p.<br/>26).</p><p>Barbour hammers home the conclusion that well temperament is evident for all<br/>organ works using the most conservative of those as prime evidence.  &quot;Even in<br/>the Orgelb&uuml;chlein, which contains the highest proportion of Bach organ works<br/>with simple compass, the latter are far outweighed by others which would be<br/>sharply dissonant in meantone tunings.&quot;  Barbour measured the compass of Bach&apos;s<br/>organ works as a whole to be Ebb-Cx, 25 degrees (Barbour, Bach, p. 84).</p><p>These organ works are pedagogical, written for his son in Cothen, to be a<br/>Dresden and Halle organist, likely in meantone.  Heinrich Sch&uuml;tz (1585-1672)<br/>referenced Dresden, Merseburg, and Halle as cities that had adopted his Psalter,<br/>wherein listeners like to follow the texts in their psalm-books, and even sing<br/>along by ear.  Praetorius worked in Dresden and Magdeburg (the city ravished<br/>by the 30 Years War and birthplace of meantone-based Telemann).  Was not Halle<br/>home to G.F. Handel of the subsemitonium organ keyboard?  Did not Johann<br/>Sebastian Bach go to Dresden to have a duel with a French organist, who thereupon<br/>fled with his tail between his legs?  Wilhelm Friedemann Bach worked almost<br/>exclusively in the meantone cities of Dresden, Merseburg, and Halle.  Friedemann<br/>studied at 15 with JG Graun in Merseburg.  Perhaps this is why his father<br/>utilized so many organ works in the Orgelb&uuml;chlein reduced to the meantone compass<br/>of notes (e.g., Eb-G#).</p><p>As we turn to the organ literature, we find that of the 148 works examined,<br/>only 15 lie completely within the E-flat-G-sharp compass, 12 of these being<br/>chorale preludes in the Orgelb&uuml;chlein.  Only one in ten would be playable on the<br/>conventionally tuned organ, or only one in thirty-four if we exclude the<br/>Orgelb&uuml;chlein!  This is an astounding result, not wholly unexpected to an organist<br/>who is familiar with the entire Bach literature, but still remarkable in the<br/>observed ratio (Barbour, Bach, p. 81).</p><p>The example of organ music culled from among many represent all periods of<br/>Bach&apos;s creative life.  &quot;They show no particular trend from youth to old age.<br/>Some of the modulations and chromatic effects referred to in our discussion are<br/>striking and dramatic (Barbour, Bach, p. 85).</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2003 3:59:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Lots of things may be &quot;playable&quot; in lots of tunings.

But<br/>even so, if you look at their concert programs, a &quot;solo keyboardist&quot;<br/>would play a concerto and improvise a fantasia within an orchestral<br/>program. Sonatas and the like were for teaching and private use, via<br/>music-sheet selling.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Bach&apos;s primary purpose in writing the (WTC), then, was to<br/>&gt; &gt;demonstrate in practice the musical manageability of all twenty-<br/>four<br/>&gt; &gt;chromatic keys, a system that had been considered only<br/>&gt; &gt;theoretically&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not true.  Well temperament was out and about.<br/>&gt;</p><p>But not as composed cycles for keyboard instruments in 24 keys, and<br/>certainly not with the sophistication of Sebastian Bach.  Wolff<br/>points out how, in the first book, the common subject of each prelude<br/>adn fugue was nothing other than the topos of the tonality itself.<br/>I.e. the triad in C Dur. R. Rasch has done the most research on this.<br/>(BTW the first such cycle was for the recorder...).</p><p>Also, the &quot;news&quot; of well temperament seems to have traveled very<br/>slowly. Haydn learned of it, from Kirnberger via von Sweten in his<br/>last decade, and it shows in his sudden use of many keys, not usual<br/>to meantone.</p><p>Gabor</p></div><h3>Jeff Olliff &#x3C;jolliff@dslnorthwest.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2003 11:32:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;<br/>&lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Which works of Bach do have wolf-related problems, no<br/>matter where</p><p>&gt; &gt; the tuning is centered?</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; It would be a big order to enumerate these, and it depends on<br/>your</p><p>&gt; definition of &quot;wolf&quot;. Does this mean the wolf fifth, or can it also</p><p>&gt; refer to sharp thirds? I certainly found things in WTC II which</p><p>&gt; didn&apos;t seem adapted to meantone.</p><p>Among single keyboard collections, which mostly support<br/>meantone, the 4 Duets at the end of Clavierubung 3 include some<br/>stark modulations suggesting ET.  I find a clear difference between<br/>the single manual chorales in this book, which always allow a<br/>meantone solution, and the organo pleno versions, which do not.  I<br/>don&apos;t have text in front of me.  To me it&apos;s simple.  Organs must have<br/>circular temperaments, readily tunable instruments may not.<br/>Meantone provides a richer palette of contrasting tone<br/>combinations than watered down alternatives, and Bach found<br/>more ways to  use them than anyone else.<br/>The worst case for meantone in WTC 1 is the B minor Fugue.  You<br/>need C but B# happens with G# six or more times, most often<br/>masked by F#.  No diminished sixths though, if you tune C through<br/>E#.  It is playable and effective, certainly an interesting experience,<br/>my fun today in my hotel in Doha.  What&apos;s wrong with meantone is<br/>it&apos;s limitations, but pushing those limitations is also a tonal resource.</p><p>The strangest exception to old keyboard temperament in WTC 2 is<br/>the Ab Major pair, among the last and grandest additions.  The<br/>prelude &amp; fugue mirror each other with cadenzas that shift around<br/>to a Gb centered tonality (from Bbb through D), while the<br/>expositions need Cb through E.  That&apos;s  14 note values, rather<br/>more than the 12 at hand.  If you want to accomodate this situation<br/>with a circulating temperament, the mutable key levers are A/Bbb,<br/>and E/Fb, so your widest fifths should be D-A-Fb-Cb, not likely to<br/>be found in any catalogue of Well Temperaments.  I think these<br/>books imply a flexibility of tuning beyond any others in our<br/>heritage, which is part of the instructional intent.   Before you neuter<br/>a note, let it find its own identity, or something like that.<br/><a href="http://www.dslnorthwest.net/~jolliff">http://www.dslnorthwest.net/~jolliff</a><br/>I just bought a nice unfretted clavichord C-d3, very much like a<br/>museum piece contemporary with Bach (Heinitz, 1716), so no more<br/>facile push button tuning for me.  We&apos;ll see how well I do with a<br/>tuning wrench.</p></div>
