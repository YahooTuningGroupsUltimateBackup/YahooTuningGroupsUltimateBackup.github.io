But still, Paul&apos;s statement strikes<br/>&gt;me as being less than totally correct.</p><p>Good thinking. Mathematically speaking, though, the statement is correct,<br/>since once you choose a certain interval (&apos;unison vector&apos;) as an equivalence<br/>relation, stacking that interval on top of itself an indefinite number of<br/>times results also in an equivalence relation. It would seem, though, that<br/>you&apos;ve pointed out an important practical shortcoming of this mathematical<br/>model.</p><p>That&apos;s not really the case. In practice, once you choose your unison vector,<br/>you&apos;re &quot;cutting off&quot; a little section of the chain of fifths and using that<br/>as your entire pitch set (i.e., the periodicity block). No other pitches<br/>come into the picture. So every time you go &quot;around&quot; the &quot;circle&quot; of 12<br/>fifths, you actually keep skipping from the end of chain back to the<br/>beginning of the chain, and you&apos;re simply ignoring the Pythagorean comma<br/>itself, never any larger multiple of it.</p><p>As for what &quot;true&quot; JI relations you can actually perceive without reducing<br/>them to a chain of simpler relations, 3-limit harmony implies one step along<br/>the chain of fifths, 9-limit harmony implies two steps along the chain,<br/>27-limit harmony implies three steps, etc. That&apos;s already beyond what I<br/>think is normally possible. To perceive a double Pythagorean comma directly,<br/>rather than as a construction from smaller units (e.g., 24 fifths), would<br/>require a sensitivity to 3^24-limit, i.e., 282,429,536,481-limit harmony. We<br/>don&apos;t really need to discuss the plausibility of that. So, since the chain<br/>of 12 fifths allows one to construct a 3:2, 9:8, 27:16 if you like, etc.,<br/>from any given note in the chain, with a maximum error of only _one_<br/>Pythagorean comma, and because you&apos;ve chosen the Pythagorean comma as your<br/>unison vector (i.e., acceptable approximation of a unison), you have, for<br/>all intents and purposes, collapsed the infinite chain of fifths into a<br/>circle.</p><p>Clear enough?</p></div>
