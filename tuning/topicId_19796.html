It might be a good idea to pack a sweater or two, but you can<br/>leave your parkas at home. For those of you who like colder weather, a<br/>half-hour drive can put you in the mountains and in the range of ski<br/>resorts. There&apos;s lots of snow there now, but I have no idea how much will<br/>be left in a month. Otherwise, nothing&apos;s likely to be frosty, especially<br/>among us good-natured tuning folk!
