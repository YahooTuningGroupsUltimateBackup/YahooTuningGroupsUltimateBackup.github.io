Personally, I think people have always sold Charles Ives short and<br/>&gt;that this condition continues.  Perhaps it seems like simple audacity for any<br/>&gt;individual to presume to read into another&apos;s words things that were missed by<br/>&gt;others.  But that&apos;s all it takes for the idea and understanding to spread.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For Ives to imagine the &quot;Universe Symphony&quot; is for Ives to imagine pure<br/>&gt;tuning as given by the cycle of fifths, the basis for the theory of keys.<br/>&gt;Just as one shouldn&apos;t review a book or a movie without reading or viewing it,<br/>&gt;perhaps one should hear the difference that the tuning adjustment in<br/>&gt;performance makes before pronouncing judgment.  By connecting the<br/>&gt;circumstantial evidence, I believe we can get to the core of Mr. Ives&apos;s<br/>&gt;imagination.</p><p>Although I am not at all familiar with the music of Ives, I&apos;ve been<br/>following this thread with interest. I&apos;ve been wondering if you&apos;ve written,<br/>or plan to write, a paper or a book on the topic. I hope so. I suspect that<br/>you probably already cited examples of recordings of his music with various<br/>tunings, but if so I haven&apos;t kept the references. Would you tell me what<br/>they are, so that I could introduce myself to his work and hear for myself<br/>the difference made by various tunings?</p><p>John Link</p><p>*************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the forthcoming CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by John Link&apos;s vocal<br/>quintet, featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of<br/>instrumental music by Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill<br/>Evans, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and<br/>Earl Zindars.</p><p>*************************************************************************</p><p>Check out <a href="http://WWW.DUESBERG.COM">WWW.DUESBERG.COM</a> for information that could make the difference<br/>between life and death for you or someone you know.</p><p>*************************************************************************</p></div><h3><a id=6410 href="#6410">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>11/27/1999 8:34:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes, John, this material will find its way into a chapter on Intonation in a<br/>book on Charles Ives&apos;s &quot;Universe Symphony.&quot;  The only recordings of retuned<br/>Ives, of any kind, are my own (Universe Symphony, Unanswered Question, 3<br/>Quarter-tone Pieces for 2 Pianos).</p><p>Each has a different commercial status and it is my challenge to make them<br/>available to a public.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=6412 href="#6412">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/1999 12:43:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Johnny Reinhard:]<br/>&gt;The only recordings of retuned Ives, of any kind, are my own<br/>(Universe Symphony, Unanswered Question, 3 Quarter-tone Pieces for 2<br/>Pianos).</p><p>Hmm, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s right.

In the time it takes to present an Ives work we could be hearing<br/>something from someone on this list for instance or some other living<br/>composer.

What Eugenio Barba has done with theater with his<br/>notion of &quot;theater anthropology&quot; is something Partch would resonate with<br/>and you would hope those that followed him would also.
