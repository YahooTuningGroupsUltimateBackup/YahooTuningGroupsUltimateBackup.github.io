The player holds<br/>and blows the instr as normal - its just that the keywork, which is<br/>more-or-less in the familiar place effects changes on the tone-holes via<br/>electronic buttons rather than mechanical touchpieces.  Same for brass<br/>instrs - I assume everyonme on the list has seen the call for scores for<br/>the 19/24-division trumpet?</p><p>We are trying to (very very slowly, admittedly) prototype flute and<br/>clarinet instrs along these lines; a 19/24-div brass quintet should be<br/>ready, hopefully, by summer 2002.</p><p>&gt;I would like to see one of those work!</p><p>Me too!</p><p>But... Giles Brindley has played his Logical Bassoon (which was the<br/>original prototype of this concept) in an amateur UK orchestra for the<br/>last 30 odd years or so.  Our (very prototype) trumpet was demonstrated<br/>at the CNMI Symposium in December.</p><p>&gt;I think it would be much easier to effect such xenharmonics in some<br/>&gt;kind of &quot;post processing&quot; which he also mentions.</p><p>Yes, much easier - but it won&apos;t ever be like acoustic intrs (I think).</p><p>&gt;Or perhaps, even more practically, what the fine composer Jonathan<br/>&gt;Harvey does... puts all the xenharmonics in the *electronic* part and<br/>&gt;uses *conventional* instruments.  Ok, so that&apos;s not going to be so<br/>&gt;much fun for somebody who wants to *play* xenharmonics, but the total<br/>&gt;piece is *definitely* xenharmonic, and Harvey gets *lots* of<br/>&gt;performances.</p><p>Jonathan does, I think, support the CNMI project in principle.<br/>Meanwhile, while new-such instrs don&apos;t exist, he writes what he can,<br/>which is I guess what we all have to do...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So what is my own *personal* conjecture as to what could be done:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) Develop more and dependable *alternate fingerings.*  Sure, they<br/>&gt;vary from instrument and player to player, but using an audio CD<br/>&gt;there should be some kind of &quot;consistency&quot; there (more on this word<br/>&gt;later)</p><p>I don&apos;t see the development of new instrs to be in contradiction with<br/>the development of extended techniques.  The two can complement each<br/>other.  As may eventually, &apos;extended techniques&apos; on new instrs.</p><p>&gt;I still don&apos;t quite understand Patrick Ozzard-Low&apos;s predilection for<br/>&gt;ETs.  He mentions the concept of &quot;consistency&quot; that, apparently Paul<br/>&gt;Erlich invented or helped to invent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Are ETs more &quot;consistent&quot; generally than irregular scales.  Maybe. ??</p><p>If you look at Appendix 4 of the book, you&apos;ll get a better idea of what<br/>is meant by &apos;consistency&apos;.  It is used here as a technical term to<br/>describe specific properties of ETs, and by which we might (ostensibly<br/>at least) distinguish which ETs might be more musically useful than<br/>another.  It was Paul Erlich&apos;s idea originally, and both he and Paul<br/>Hahn very generously helped me write the Appendix.</p><p>&gt;Anyway, Ozzare-Low seems to like them better.  I was trying to find a<br/>&gt;clear reason in his writing, but wasn&apos;t coming up with the answer.</p><p>Well, you might revisit the text on that.  To put it in a nutshell:</p><p>1: most instruments aren&apos;t used to realise 12-ET anyway, even though<br/>they are (to some degree, anyway) designed and engineered to realise<br/>something which approximates it.</p><p>2: and new instruments will be in just the same relation to intonation<br/>as the existing ones.</p><p>3: performance of any tuning system on instrs of non-fixed intonation<br/>(including JI, 12-ET, etc etc) is very much up to the ear of the<br/>performer</p><p>4: the majority of living contemporary composers are used to being able<br/>to transpose and modulate in wild and yet consistent ways - that is very<br/>much easier to achieve if the &apos;logic&apos; behind what is happening (if not<br/>the precise intonation which results) is an ET (of some sort).</p><p>&gt;So, that was a fascinating read.</p><p>Thanks...</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not quite sure why he felt he<br/>&gt;had to try to encapsulate the entire history of tuning theory in the<br/>&gt;paper rather than refer to other things, but maybe he thought that<br/>&gt;background was necessary in many people&apos;s understanding of the<br/>&gt;paper.</p><p>Well, in fact its very thin on history, really, if you reflect on that!</p><p>Don&apos;t know if I really want to get into all the discussions again about<br/>all this, as I guess we&apos;ll go round in the usual circles!  However, so<br/>far we CNMI is persevering with the new instr concept.</p><p>The Symposium back in December went OK - though there was nothing very<br/>new to report.  Graham Breed (on the list) came along, and maybe he<br/>mentioned it.</p><p>all best to everyone,</p><p>Patrick</p><p>--<br/>Patrick Ozzard-Low,<br/><a href="http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi">http://www.lgu.ac.uk/mit/cnmi</a><br/><a href="http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">http://www.c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a><br/><a href="mailto:pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk">mailto:pol@c21-orch-instrs.demon.co.uk</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2002 7:33:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Patrick Ozzard-Low &lt;pol@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/33684">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/33684</a></p><p>&gt; First - Joe, thanks for your interest and comments!<br/>&gt;</p><p>****My pleasure!

Rest assured, I am *totally* supportive of<br/>the concept of CNMI and all the developments.

One problem that got mentioned was that<br/>the solenoids on the adapted trumpets are slow to react, so aren&apos;t really<br/>good enough for trills.  Probably somebody will come up with a better idea<br/>-- solenoids are somewhat old hat after all.</p><p>Do you have the URL for the CNMI&apos;s discussion forum?
