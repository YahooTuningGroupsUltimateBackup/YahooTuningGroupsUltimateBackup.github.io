We don&apos;t have any experiments at all to talk about at<br/>all. And, all the ones you keep proposing are like &quot;go survey the<br/>microtonal community and see if people claim to perceive a resemblance<br/>between A and B, and if not, that establishes musical impossibility to<br/>a high degree of confidence because of Russell&apos;s teapot.&quot; No, this<br/>isn&apos;t &quot;scientific&quot; at all; it doesn&apos;t establish anything of the sort.</p><p>If you&apos;d like to really do an experiment that would yield useful<br/>information to talk about, then go and do what every other real-life<br/>scientific field does in this situation, which is actually perform a<br/>basic longitudinal study over the course of many years where you give<br/>a whole bunch of people new tuning systems to play around with and see<br/>how their perception changes. That would be the sort of thing that<br/>actually DOES help us understand how adaptations to novel tuning<br/>systems work, at least as a starting point for foundational research,<br/>much unlike what we have now.</p><p>And, even if you got sponsorship from a University and did such a<br/>study above (and if this is what you want to do, I&apos;m all for being a<br/>part of it), that still wouldn&apos;t be the definitive end of the story,<br/>no matter how much money you spend:</p><p>- Did you check to see what the difference was between musicians and<br/>non-musicians?<br/>- How do you know that you&apos;re not just measuring what people typically<br/>tend to adapt to, as opposed to what they COULD adapt to with specific<br/>ear training that your study didn&apos;t include?<br/>- Did the choice of instrument played (i.e. timbre) influence the<br/>results at all?<br/>- Was there a difference between the musicians who were still playing<br/>in 12-EDO at the time, and the ones who only did this for many years?<br/>- Were the musicians too used to 12 to adapt, and the nonmusicians too<br/>lacking in musical ability to adapt, thus excluding the population of<br/>people with musical ability</p><p>etc. There will be a ton of criticism, which will hopefully spawn some<br/>more studies. And if history has anything to say on the subject,<br/>whatever conclusions you extrapolate from it will probably be changed<br/>pretty dramatically within 20-30 years. And, in the meantime, we&apos;ll<br/>still have to deal with taxes and staying in shape and politics and<br/>all of the other mundane aspects of ordinary life. But, it would at<br/>least be a good starting point, and one more susceptible to &quot;Russel&apos;s<br/>teapot&quot; debates.</p><p>If what we care about is adhering to &quot;science,&quot; then this is what<br/>&quot;science&quot; actually looks like in the real world for every other<br/>real-life scientific field on planet Earth that actually adheres to<br/>the scientific method when these sorts of questions come up. It&apos;s very<br/>clear what the different roles of cross-sectional vs longitudinal vs<br/>epidemiological vs etc studies all are and people are careful not to<br/>equivocate between them (unless they&apos;re trying to sell fad diet<br/>books). Basing concrete physiological claims on the results of an<br/>epidemiological study is a big no-no in medicine, for instance, just<br/>like making neurological and cognitive claims from the results of...<br/>no study at all... makes no sense at all in the context of our little<br/>group here.</p><p>AND IF NO LONGITUDINAL STUDY IS AVAILABLE, people don&apos;t just pretend<br/>that it is, or lower their standards to accommodate the lack of<br/>existing research. They don&apos;t just commit an &quot;argument from financial<br/>infeasibility&quot; fallacy and just pretend the matter is still solved,<br/>because of &quot;science.&quot; They accept that the existing research, or<br/>pseudo-research, is nothing more than an interesting, non-conclusive<br/>platform for further study, and openly admit when their speculation is<br/>speculation.</p><p>However, sometimes I think that we&apos;re not really too concerned about<br/>fetishizing science on here (I&apos;m into some pretty hardcore science<br/>pr0n myself), but about fetishizing some philosophy on life which is<br/>just claimed de facto to BE &quot;more scientific.&quot; This discussion has no<br/>place in actual science at all.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
