I hope not. Actually my two<br/>short concerts last week went well tuning-wise:  the instrument held<br/>almost perfectly over two days, being moved before and after the<br/>concert, and only a handful of notes needed correcting each time.<br/>Which was lucky, considering the number of tourists mumbling around<br/>the church, not to mention the babies. My only anxiety in the end was<br/>putting my fingers in the wrong place. Pianos are really not that much<br/>better: recording studios generally keep a tuner/technician on hand<br/>during any piano solo recording. There are literally about ten times<br/>as many things that can go wrong in a piano.</p><p>What I said was that harpsichords are *individual*. You probably<br/>wouldn&apos;t compose the same way for a small Italian single manual one as<br/>for a large French double manual. (Would you write a song the same way<br/>for Sting and Dmitri Hvorostovsky?)</p><p>This is a *good* thing about harpsichords, because it means one can<br/>create more individual and interesting music than if they all sounded<br/>the same.</p><p>You may find it written that much harpsichord music is suited for many<br/>different types of instrument; and so it can be (Bach is usually<br/>cited) - but much of it was also written to exploit specific and<br/>individual types of sonority.</p><p>Anyway, if you want to compose something for the harpsichord, whatever<br/>kind, you have to hear it first, I mean really *listen* in detail.<br/>Which means you either have to buy one, or hear a lot of good,<br/>recently recorded harpsichord CDs - and even then you won&apos;t get much<br/>idea what strongly unconventional tunings sound like, unless there is<br/>some interesting stuff going on with meantone.</p><p>But how much must you spend to buy a musically perfectly functional<br/>instrument? Probably less than $5,000, actually.</p><p>For example this one is $6,000 brand new :<br/><a href="http://www.dalyharpsichords.com/Bambino.htm">http://www.dalyharpsichords.com/Bambino.htm</a></p><p>if you are willing to look around for second-hand - including spinets<br/>and virginals - you can get pretty cheap. See here:</p><p><a href="http://www.harpsichord.com/List/list_frmset.html">http://www.harpsichord.com/List/list_frmset.html</a></p><p>As for modern harpsichord music, check these out:<br/><a href="http://netcells.net/creative/index.php?g=1203780257">http://netcells.net/creative/index.php?g=1203780257</a></p><p>That is Jane Chapman&apos;s repertoire, how many dozens of pieces do you want?</p><p>Writing in &apos;unusual&apos; tuning for harpsichord is, in the abstract, a<br/>fairly good idea, because the instrument&apos;s tuning is very easy to<br/>alter within limits (given a reasonable time to achieve the new<br/>tuning). Main thing to note is that you can&apos;t take strings a semitone<br/>above their intended pitch level without considerable risk of breakage.</p><p>Perhaps you should try composing for synthetic MIDI harpsichord timbre<br/>instead. It&apos;s ugly and monotonous, but also extremely cheap, and can<br/>be retuned absolutely at will!</p><p>Honestly, I don&apos;t know what you are really wanting to do. I would hope<br/>the musical idea comes first, then when you get some more precise<br/>notion of what it should sound like, your tuning requirements should<br/>fall into place. Or if you hear a recording or performance where you<br/>really like the tuning, or the sound of the instrument, you can try<br/>and find out what it was and go from there. I&apos;m not sure where the<br/>rest of us come in to the game. Composing is a solo sport...</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div>
