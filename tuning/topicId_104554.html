A page in progress with all of this is on the wiki here:<br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Mike%27s+Lectures+On+Regular+Temperament+Theory">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Mike%27s+Lectures+On+Regular+Temperament+Theory</a></p><p>While my goal with this was basically to innovate as little as<br/>possible and just say things exactly as they&apos;re described, there were<br/>a few things that I&apos;ve consistently seen trip up EVERYONE who&apos;s new to<br/>this stuff, to the point where I thought a slight alteration would<br/>really help people understand much better. All of these things usually<br/>have to do with contorsion and so on. In these few cases I took the<br/>liberty of proposing some subtle extensions to bra-ket notation to<br/>make it clear exactly what idea I&apos;m talking about. These extensions<br/>are:</p><p>&lt;a b c| - val<br/>|a b c&gt; - monzo</p><p>(a b c| - projective val<br/>|a b c) - projective monzo</p><p>{a b c| - tuning map</p><p>The one that&apos;s most important is the projective one. Get any<br/>reasonably intelligent person who you&apos;ve explained the bare basics to,<br/>and then tell them the only 5-limit temperament tempering out 81/80<br/>and 128/125 is &lt;12 19 28|, and watch the look of confusion on their<br/>faces. At this juncture, which is inevitable, I believe it&apos;s<br/>suboptimal to attempt explanations of the nature that &lt;24 38 56| is<br/>&quot;not a temperament,&quot; or that &lt;24 38 56| tempers out (81/80)^2 but not<br/>81/80 itself or what have you, or that &lt;24 38 56| and &lt;12 19 28| &quot;are<br/>the same thing,&quot; or that there&apos;s a difference between 24-EDO and<br/>24-TET, etc. I&apos;ve tried all of these things at different points and<br/>I&apos;ve found they&apos;re just great ways to confuse the hell out of anyone.</p><p>There&apos;s no need to ever get into that, because we all know exactly<br/>what&apos;s going on. Rank-1 temperaments aren&apos;t vals, but are instead<br/>these magical things that correspond to lines through the origin. We<br/>can talk about &lt;12 19 28| in a projective sense, but to suddenly<br/>conflate that with the other sort of val without being very clear is,<br/>I&apos;ve found, a recipe for disaster. And sweeping this distinction under<br/>the rug by defining the word &quot;temperament&quot; cleverly enough also is<br/>something I think is a bad idea. In this case, the set of all vals<br/>tempering out both 81/80 and 128/125 forms a line through the origin,<br/>and is obviously not just the single val &lt;12 19 28|, and any new<br/>person who thinks enough about that will get it.</p><p>I think it&apos;s best to just be as explicit as possible about it from the<br/>beginning. And a good way to be explicit is to just alter the notation<br/>slightly so that it&apos;s always clear when you&apos;re talking about a<br/>projective vector or a subspace being spanned by a vector.</p><p>To notate a projective vector or a line through the origin and a<br/>vector, something like (12 29 28| fits the bill, with parentheses as a<br/>logical choice since they&apos;re used in homogenous coordinates anyway and<br/>look like a semicircle. The actual rank-1 temperament eliminating<br/>81/80 and 128/125 is thus (12 29 28|, which is a fundamental<br/>mathematical object that&apos;s independent from any one val. Then &lt;12 19<br/>28|, &lt;24 38 56|, etc, are all vals supporting this temperament, just<br/>like a val can support any temperament.</p><p>I also suggested {a b c| for tuning maps. This is because we just got<br/>in a big discussion over whether or not tuning maps are in &quot;the same<br/>space&quot; as vals and just interpreted differently, or if they&apos;re in &quot;a<br/>different space&quot; as vals or whatever. Clearly it doesn&apos;t matter<br/>because those two options are basically the same.</p><p>Whether or not you think tuning maps are in the same space as vals or<br/>not, they definitely imply a clear conceptual difference in how one is<br/>interpreting the musical relevance of the space of covectors. Since<br/>they&apos;re different enough to talk about as being different in English,<br/>there&apos;s no reason we can&apos;t just use shorthand for it and write {a b c|<br/>for them. This is especially useful, I think, because I don&apos;t know<br/>anyone who hasn&apos;t gotten tripped up at some point on the difference<br/>between vals and tuning maps, thinking that there&apos;s some mystical<br/>connection between them when there isn&apos;t, or confusing subtle aspects<br/>of the two.</p><p>This also leaves open the possibility of there being something like |a<br/>b c}, but I have no idea what that would be. If anyone has any ideas,<br/>I&apos;m all ears.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=104555 href="#104555">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2012 11:56:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Whether or not you think tuning maps are in the same space as vals or<br/>&gt; not, they definitely imply a clear conceptual difference in how one is<br/>&gt; interpreting the musical relevance of the space of covectors.

I wouldn&apos;t call an element of tuning space a<br/>&gt; &quot;tuning map&quot; unless it makes some sort of sense as one myself.</p><p>As you know, there was some disagreement over all of the different<br/>ways to look at the same exact thing. Paul wanted tuning maps to be in<br/>a separate vector space with units of &quot;cents&quot; or some such, along with<br/>a canonical isomorphism from &lt;a b c| in the first space to &lt;a b c| in<br/>the other space. You thought that was silly, and thought they should<br/>just be two different ways to interpret the same space. I think we<br/>left off that it was all the same.</p><p>All -I&apos;m- saying is, regardless of how you want to model things, that<br/>&lt;a b c| is a val, and {a b c| is a tuning map. Since there are<br/>obviously different mathematical ways to model the two, which are<br/>trivially isomorphic to one another then the mathematical<br/>interpretation of these elements will also change.</p><p>If you want to say that tuning maps lie in a separate vector space<br/>with units, then that&apos;s what the {a b c| is denoting - that it&apos;s in<br/>this space which has units of cents or millioctaves or whatever, as<br/>per Paul&apos;s use. Then &lt;a b c| refers to the elements in the normal dual<br/>space to interval space.</p><p>If you want to say that tuning maps are just another interpretation of<br/>the same elements in the same space, then {a b c| serves instead to<br/>denote the intended interpretation explicitly, rather than leaving it<br/>implicit, and assuming that a new student is going to be smart enough<br/>to figure things out from context.</p><p>It seemed above like you were suggesting that {a b c| is just the<br/>default notation for covectors. If that&apos;s how you want to do it, then<br/>instead &lt;a b c| becomes the &quot;special&quot; thing, this time denoting those<br/>special covectors which lie on the lattice of vals which has been<br/>embedded into the space. And then |a b c} can be the default for<br/>vectors, and then |a b c&gt; denotes the special vectors which lie on the<br/>embedded lattice of monzos.</p><p>It&apos;s all the same. I&apos;ll leave the philosophizing out of it and just<br/>suggest it&apos;s a useful notation for tuning maps vs vals.</p><p>For instance, you said you wouldn&apos;t call an element of tuning space a<br/>tuning map unless it makes some sort of sense as one. If your paradigm<br/>includes some notion of things &quot;making sense&quot; as tuning maps and using<br/>the English-language phrase &quot;tuning map&quot; to describe a bra like &lt;a b<br/>c| when it makes sense, then I simply suggest that it may be useful to<br/>shorten things like &quot;prepare! this is a tuning map: &lt;a b c|&quot; to just<br/>&quot;{a b c|.&quot;</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
