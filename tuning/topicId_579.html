No fifths all<br/>fifths&#xFFFD; beats and no beats&#xFFFD; melodic commas and harmonic commas&#xFFFD; the good the<br/>bad and the neutral...**</p><p>JUST INTONATION EXPLAINED...<br/>When I first started to delve into a bit of the written material on<br/>&#xFFFD;alternate intonational scenarios&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; three things seemed to jump right out at<br/>me: 1) That the theoretical and technical scope was immense, _extremely_<br/>daunting, and (ultimately) as irresistible as the actual sounds&#xFFFD; 2) That<br/>until the widespread advent of the Internet, you had to look hard and far to<br/>acquire much more than a misunderstood misrepresentation of Harry Partch and<br/>quartertones&#xFFFD; and 3) From the &quot;trista&quot;*** of Hermann Helmholtz&#xFFFD; &#xFFFD;On the<br/>Sensation of Tone&#xFFFD; to the red meat, processed sugars, and violent action<br/>movies**** of Kyle Gann&#xFFFD;s &#xFFFD;Just Intonation Explained&#xFFFD; -- my personal awes<br/>and admiration&#xFFFD;s of an undiminished pitch continuum (where all the possible<br/>resources one could find and make useful were as such _fundamentally<br/>useful_) stood in stark contrast to the oft repeated ideological<br/>equilibrium&apos;s of Just Intonation&#xFFFD;</p><p>UNEXHAUSTED TREASURE...<br/>In his introduction to the 1954 edition of &#xFFFD;On The Sensation Of Tone&#xFFFD;, Henry<br/>Margenau wrote: &quot;&#xFFFD;and the musician finds in it unexhausted treasure if he<br/>wishes to understand his art&#xFFFD;&quot; He got the unexhausted treasure part<br/>right! -- But the indicative &quot;IF&quot; of an &quot;if he wishes to understand his<br/>art&quot;***** has empowered not only the careful and considered &#xFFFD;high<br/>accountabilities&#xFFFD; of physiological literatim (et al)&#xFFFD; but also a plethora of<br/>axiomatic perorations and inimical broadsides that to this day comprise a<br/>sizable portion of the alternative tuning narrative&#xFFFD;</p><p>Dan</p><p>*For anyone who might be interested in hearing an audio example of these<br/>types of &#xFFFD;experiments and curiosities&apos; - see Blue Caro.rm or Silvered.rm @:<br/><a href="http://members.xoom.com/Minor2nd/">http://members.xoom.com/Minor2nd/</a></p><p>**Of course this is neither artistic carte blanche nor righteous character<br/>contingency&#xFFFD; (It is largely an autobiographical extrapolation of the<br/>anterior antecedents that take the soul + brain + ear + eye + hand ensemble<br/>of the conditioned and the innate in for a reasonably robust turn or two in<br/>the first place.)</p><p>***pg. 230 [Helmholtz, &#xFFFD;On the Sensations of Tone&#xFFFD;]</p><p>****The actual quote from Kyle Gann&#xFFFD;s &#xFFFD;Just Intonation Explained&#xFFFD; @:<br/><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/tuning.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/tuning.html</a> is... &quot;Equal temperament could<br/>be described as the musical equivalent to eating a lot of red meat and<br/>processed sugars and watching violent action films.&quot;</p><p>*****While it&#xFFFD;s obviously impossible to say exactly what role &#xFFFD;Genesis Of A<br/>Music&#xFFFD; played in supplying an example for the germane exculpation from an<br/>unsatisfactory status quo and the UPPERCASE intemperance of an ideology&#xFFFD;<br/>Surely Harry Partch embodied as vibrant a dose of the former as could<br/>perhaps be hoped for _and_ preached the latter with a blaring glee of rarely<br/>matched perspicacity and derision! And to be truthful (whether I agree with<br/>it or not) his carrying on rarely rubs me the wrong way&#xFFFD; much the same way<br/>as Charles Ives&#xFFFD; &#xFFFD;Memos&#xFFFD; rarely strikes me as anything but &#xFFFD;in context&#xFFFD;.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>TESTIS UNUS, TESTIS NULLUS...<br/>Personally I just can&#xFFFD;t help but feel that if the great anagogic promise of<br/>art lies outside the realm of some wayward humanistic ideomotor<br/>impingement... it most surely must encompass a hell of a lot more than the<br/>refined explications of any one of its teleological simulacrums&#xFFFD;</p></div>
