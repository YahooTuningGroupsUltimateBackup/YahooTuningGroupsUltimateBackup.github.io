I&apos;ll send a quote<br/>from him re the final universal acceptance of equal<br/>temperament which he reported as having occurred<br/>&quot;within the last 50 years&quot; in which he compares<br/>equal temperament with the earlier tuning methods<br/>shortly.</p><p>I suspect that around 100 years ago equal temperament<br/>may have been promoted with such forcefulness that<br/>history could have been partially rewritten and a<br/>bias towards equal temperament and against anything<br/>else have been implanted in musicians and music<br/>students which still affects attitudes in the present.<br/>I believe that equal temperament is to an extent based<br/>on people&apos;s accepting an illusion.  In order to maintain<br/>the illusion, voices raising doubts about it mustn&apos;t be<br/>allowed to be heard too widely.</p><p>People could have believed that they were doing the<br/>right thing in promoting such an illusion as equal<br/>temperament was extremely practical and people&apos;s<br/>enjoyment of equal tempered music would be spoiled<br/>if they were to have doubts raised about the music&apos;s<br/>quality being compromised in some way (through<br/>temperament).  One music professor told me that he<br/>had always been told that the deviations in pitches<br/>introduced by equal temperament were so small that<br/>they had a negligible effect on the way the music<br/>sounded.  When he heard side by side piano performances<br/>of simple pieces in equal temperament and mean tone<br/>temperament he said that to his surprise he found that<br/>there was a big difference and that to him the mean<br/>tone version sounded better than did the equal tempered<br/>version.  After having heard the comparison, his reaction<br/>was that it seemed to him difficult to understand how<br/>equal temperament could have been universally adopted<br/>by the music world.</p><p>I&apos;ll send the page and a half quotation from Fischer soon.</p><p>Dave Hill   La Mesa, CA</p></div>
