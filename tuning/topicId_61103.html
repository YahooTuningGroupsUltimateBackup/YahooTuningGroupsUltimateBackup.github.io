Wanted to get some ideas about tuning my UKELIN [1/2 Ukelele -1/2 violin] for a JI piece i am working on. In addition, if anyone has had any experience re-stringing one i would love to hear your perspectives.<br/>It has 16 zither like strings and 16 strummable strings and has this dreamy kind of reverb sound.</p><p>any/all info ideas are welcomed. i have of course affixed a pickup to it for that JOhnCAle/Tony Conrad drone that is so snapping with the kids nowadays</p><p>Patrick Pagano,B.S., M.F.A<br/>Digital Media Specialist/IT Expert<br/>Digital Worlds Institute<br/>University Of Florida<br/>(352) 294-2082</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>---------------------------------<br/>Yahoo! for Good<br/> Click here to donate to the Hurricane Katrina relief effort.</p></div>
