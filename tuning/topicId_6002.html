This feature is important to Carl Lumma&apos;s postings, to row use in<br/>late Stravinsky, indexing in Babbitt, and -- I believe, please correct me if<br/>I&apos;m wrong -- to George Perle&apos;s &quot;twelve-tone tonality&quot;.)</p><p>There is a mountain of twelve-tone theory, much redundant and most of little<br/>interest.  I find that if you want to wade through these waters, it is best<br/>to start at the source, i.e.:</p><p>M. Babbitt: &quot;Since Schoenberg&quot;, PNM 12 nos 1-2: 3-28 (see esp. page 26)</p><p>and for the topic of row verticals/diagonals:</p><p>M.
