Highlight the line with the<br/>numbers, press Ctrl+C, then press Ctrl+Alt+D. If you can&apos;t hear it, try<br/>turning up your speaker volume.</p><p>EXAMPLE TEXT LINE 1</p><p>1/1 6/5 3/2 3/2 3/1</p><p>EXAMPLE TEXT LINE 2</p><p>3:4:5 GarbageText 11&amp;333/127&amp;7:8:9&amp;MoreGarbageText&amp;5:4:3:2 6&amp;14 3&amp;11<br/>0&amp;6&amp;14&amp;19 0&amp;-8.75&amp;4.5 0&amp;6&amp;11&amp;1/2&amp;3/4 3 6 11/5 7/4 3/2 5/4 6/5 3 3 3 3 6 11<br/>11 11 6 8 7 6.5 -2 0 0 0 3/4 5/8 1/2 3/5 3/4 3/4 3/2 5/4 1/1 6/5 3/2 3/2 3/1<br/>5/2 2/1 12/5 3/1 3/1</p></div>
