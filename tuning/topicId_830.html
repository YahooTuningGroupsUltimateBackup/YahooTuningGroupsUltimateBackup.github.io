I could hear a lot of influences of Terry Riley,<br/>Steve Reich, even a little bit of Lou Harrison.  The music was very<br/>interesting, though some of it fell into the &quot;that&apos;s not music, that&apos;s<br/>noise&quot; category.  (But it was really good noise!)</p><p>Can anyone tell me more about Robert Davidson.  The announcer didn&apos;t mention<br/>anything about tunings, but it seemed obvious to me that Mr. Davidson is not<br/>tied to 12TET.</p><p>    -b0b-</p><p><a href="http://www.b0b.com/tunings">www.b0b.com/tunings</a></p></div>
