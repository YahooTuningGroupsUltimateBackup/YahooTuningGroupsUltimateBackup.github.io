On a 19-tET keyboard like<br/>that of Costeley, or the almost identical 1/3-comma tuning of Salinas, the<br/>same note would serve for Cb or B#, and again no adjustment would be<br/>needed.</p><p>The one question with this piece is whether at any point intervals<br/>intended as equivalent to major thirds are spelled as diminished<br/>fourths: Vincenzo Galilei used this kind of spelling as an example of what<br/>only a 12-tET instrument like the lute (or one in an unequal 12-note<br/>well-temperament, one might add) could handle.</p><p>One article mentions this possibility, but Lindley implies that this kind<br/>of conflict for extended meantone doesn&apos;t arise in the Bull piece<br/>(sections with sharps and sections with flats occur, but not mixtures of<br/>these accidentals at the same time), and I don&apos;t recall seeing such a<br/>problem.</p><p>Needless to say, I sure wonder what that &quot;Pythagorean Temperament&quot; might<br/>have been. Neo-Gothic equitones temper fifths in the wide direction to get<br/>14:11 major thirds and the like, but maybe that would be different from<br/>what is suggested by Yates.</p><p>I&apos;d add that Pythagorean intonation can support some very complex<br/>polyphony, with the late 14th-century variety of style a fine<br/>example. (People sometimes debate what kinds of tunings might have been<br/>used in practice, especially by singers and players of flexible-pitched<br/>instruments, but I love improvising in this kind of style in a usual<br/>Pythagorean tuning of Eb-G#, not to mention tunings with fifths wider than<br/>pure.) Here I suspect that &quot;simple&quot; could be taken to mean &quot;verticality<br/>based on fifths and fourths as the main concords,&quot; and &quot;complex&quot; to mean<br/>&quot;based on stable thirds and sixths.&quot; Around 1960, this was the prevailing<br/>view of music history, not so surprisingly.</p><p>One might also add, as sometimes discussed here, that the transition in<br/>the 15th century seems to have been mainly from Pythagorean to meantone,<br/>with 5-limit just intonation as a more of a model and ideal for voices and<br/>other flexible pitched instruments than a standard keyboard tuning,<br/>although Lindley and others have noted that complex schemes combining<br/>Pythagorean and &quot;5-limit just&quot; elements might have played a role in the<br/>transition to meantone around 1450 or so.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=21309 href="#21309">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2001 8:24:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; Needless to say, I sure wonder what that &quot;Pythagorean Temperament&quot;<br/>might<br/>&gt; have been.
