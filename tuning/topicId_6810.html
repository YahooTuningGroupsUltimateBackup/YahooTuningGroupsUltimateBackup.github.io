One turns one ear into a &quot;micro-scope&quot; to detect fine<br/>gradations of tunings, but most importantly, one is simply aware of, and<br/>sensitized to,  tuning as a dimension of what one is listening to. This way,<br/>for a listener either all music is microtonal, or none of it is. 12tet is<br/>heard as having no less of a tuning dimension than just or meantone. Neither<br/>is the &quot;tuning dimension&quot; simply quantitative, in the sense of an analytical<br/>perception of tuning &quot;sizes&quot;, but it becomes an important component of the<br/>expressiveness of harmony.</p><p>When 12tet is heard simply as &quot;the way music sounds&quot; then in effect the<br/>notes become neutral place-markers that only serve to make audible harmonic<br/>and contrapuntal combinations. Its like DNA except instead of four place<br/>markers in infinite permutations it is 12. Since only four are needed to<br/>encode a human being, its no wonder that 12 seems inexhaustible. Once the<br/>tuning dimension is added to (not substituted for) this, the tuning-quality<br/>of the intervals becomes part of their expression. You could consider<br/>composing in et like black and white drawing or photography, and non-et as<br/>adding a color dimension.</p><p>For the microtonally &quot;awake&quot;, all music is microtonal, but for the sleeping,<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; music is &quot;different&quot; or &quot;funny sounding&quot; or even &quot;out of tune&quot;.<br/>In effect, &quot;microtonal&quot; is understood to mean music that, in a given<br/>context, is &quot;usually&quot; tuned differently. Indonesian music is not usually<br/>thought of as &quot;microtonal&quot; because it always sounds that way, whereas a<br/>piano played in any non 12tet tuning is still rare enough to sound<br/>&quot;different&quot;.</p><p>So, in a way, it does a disservice to call a piece &quot;microtonal&quot; for it<br/>artificially consigns it to the category of &quot;music that sounds funny because<br/>it we&apos;re used to music in similar contexts sounding different.&quot; All the<br/>other options suffer from the same drawback- they imply that the tuning<br/>dimension is &gt;more&lt; important than usual, or that the piece is &quot;about&quot; its<br/>tuning system. Maybe sometimes it is. But as I said, for one who is aware,<br/>the tuning dimension is equally present in all music.</p><p>Since all music uses &gt;some&lt; tuning, it should really be a non-issue, and<br/>other stylistic elements will determine the music&apos;s  &quot;category&quot;. So maybe<br/>there shouldn&apos;t be a &quot;microtonal&quot; category at <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> at all, just pieces in<br/>various styles that happen to use unusual or unexpected tunings, if anyone<br/>is interested.</p><p>Since Lenny B was mentioned, I remember seeing him receive an award on TV at<br/>the Grammys years ago. The man was so sloshed he could barely talk, but he<br/>managed to say &quot;Theres only two kinds of music - good music and bad music&quot;.<br/>I definitely think he had a point there.</p><p>dante</p></div><h3><a id=6811 href="#6811">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/10/1999 5:55:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes, Dante, you make good points. I can certainly relate to the hearing of<br/>all music as microtonal.</p><p>Microtonal music is interstylistic: This is why it never bothered me that<br/>there would never be a &quot;microtonal&quot; section at Tower Records, nor should<br/>there be.  It&apos;s the reason The Village Voice didn&apos;t write anything about the<br/>AFMM until a &quot;microtonal&quot; eared Kyle Gann joined the staff.  The Voice arts<br/>director scolded me earlier for this by saying it was &quot;microtonal&quot;&apos;s  fault<br/>that it didn&apos;t not fit into easy, already set-up categories.  Thank you Kyle!</p><p>Yes, after _all_ music can be perceived through the microtonal organs that<br/>are your ears, the word would lose meaning.  To those are concerned by this<br/>(or by the eventual shrinking of the universe, or Y2K, or whatever) please<br/>don&apos;t over-react.  Words do evolve their meaning, no matter how tight a<br/>strangle hold any individual puts on a particular word, and we will survive.</p><p>There are pros and cons to every word.  From my vantaged position, all music<br/>is microtonal and has been for a score of years, and I&apos;m not alone, as<br/>members of this list have volunteered.  It&apos;s just ridiculous for me to negate<br/>the larger microtonal intervals from the word &quot;microtonal.&quot;  (Why not cut off<br/>your nose to spite your face?)  I respect different views on this subject as<br/>I do different religions, and non-religinons. It&apos;s just not my script and I<br/>won&apos;t have it force upon me.</p><p>BTW, I don&apos;t recall anybody ever feeling it was a mistake to be on a<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; festival for fear it might impact negatively on their<br/>reputations.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=6898 href="#6898">ðŸ”—</a>Drew Skyfyre &#x3C;skyfyre2@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/1999 10:00:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My vote for all-encompassing term goes to &quot;Xenharmonics&quot;.<br/>The literal translation from the Greek Xenos is &quot;strange&quot; (more or less, I<br/>gather). But it also implies adventure &amp; exploration.</p><p>Microtonal seems to me to be a quite inaccurate and somewhat meaningless<br/>term, requiring as it does some sort of reference point. &quot;Micro&quot; after all<br/>does mean &amp; come from the Greek &quot;mikros&quot; - small. So the question arises,<br/>small of what ? And if one just means any small interval, then what of the<br/>large ones like in 5 EDO ? And where does small end &amp; big begin ?</p><p>- Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Thousands of Stores.  Millions of Products.
