Not really my<br/>problem, after all -- I don&apos;t have a xen instrument except my computer. I<br/>map Dutch note names to cent values in Lilypond, and that&apos;s good enough.<br/>Nobody&apos;s going to play my stuff, either, so what difference does *notation*<br/>make?</p><p>Quite a bit, as it turns out.</p><p>I forget why it came up, but I started reading about Saggital while on<br/>vacation a few weeks ago. I had thought that it was primarily for JI, but<br/>it turns out it&apos;s supposed to be useful for EDOs, too, and that -- along<br/>with the linkage between EDOs and JI -- is where it&apos;s really, really smart.</p><p>It&apos;s so much easier to think in terms of note names and accidentals than in<br/>the numbers or scordatura or what have you that I&apos;ve been using. &quot;C E\! G&quot;<br/>builds on what I already know about C, E, and G in 12 EDO / Pythagorean,<br/>letting me instantly recognize that this is a C major chord with an<br/>approximately just major third. E\!/ G\!/ B\!/ is an E minor chord. E\!/<br/>means I&apos;m getting something like a neutral third -- the single (or triple)<br/>stem makes me think of prime eleven.</p><p>Relationships of accidentals in a scale matter, too. For instance, seeing<br/>the sequence C E\!!!/ E\!!/ E\!/ E G\!/ G in Wurschmidt[13] shows me that I<br/>have nothing that looks much like a second or fourth, and lots of choices<br/>of thirds.</p><p>Those relationships can tell me about the &quot;patent temperament&quot;[1] of the<br/>EDO I&apos;m using[2]: When I see an &quot;E&quot; and no &quot;E\!&quot; in 31 EDO, that means that<br/>31 tempers out 81/80; seeing both &quot;E&quot; and &quot;E\!&quot; in 53 EDO means that 53<br/>doesn&apos;t temper out 81/80.</p><p>[1] Is that a term? I mean the temperament given using the patent val.<br/>[2] Though not necessarily the temperament I&apos;m using, if I&apos;m not using the<br/>patent val.</p><p>Seriously, who wouldn&apos;t love that?</p><p>Don&apos;t get me wrong: I&apos;m sure I haven&apos;t grokked it in any kind of detail.<br/>But that&apos;s part of the beauty of the system. I don&apos;t have to grok all the<br/>detail to find it useful. And now, although I *could* generate a complete<br/>set of accidentals for, say, 31 EDO, I don&apos;t have to, because Scala does it<br/>for me. (Thank you again, Manuel!)</p><p>So, thank you to all those involved in making Saggital notation, especially<br/>the ringleaders, and if you haven&apos;t tried Saggital yet, I recommend it.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=106282 href="#106282">ðŸ”—</a>gedankenwelt94@...</h3><span>9/5/2013 6:35:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jake,</p><p>&gt; I had thought that it was primarily for JI, but it turns out it&apos;s supposed to<br/>be useful for</p><p>&gt; EDOs, too, and that -- along with the linkage between EDOs and JI -- is where<br/>it&apos;s really,</p><p>&gt; really smart.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s so much easier to think in terms of note names and accidentals than in<br/>the numbers</p><p>&gt; or scordatura or what have you that I&apos;ve been using. &quot;C E\!

The idea to use conventional notation and<br/>microtonal</p><p>accidentals to notate just intonation is nothing new, and dates back at least to<br/>Helmholtz.</p><p>However, from what I think I remember having read about Sagittal notation, much<br/>thought</p><p>was put in the choice of accidentals, commas that can usually be ignored, and<br/>for which</p><p>EDO the patent val or a subgroup mapping is used.

Clearly, any JI notation can be<br/>adjusted for any temperament or EDO by, say, dropping the Didymos<br/>accidental for the third if you&apos;re playing in meantone (which is why the<br/>major third C-E in 12 EDO has no accidentals), but the way it fell into<br/>place for Saggital just seemed more natural to me.</p><p>That could have had to do with the explanation I was reading or where I was<br/>coming from, too, of course. :)</p><p>&gt; So I think the special thing about Sagittal is not what it accomplishes<br/>(supporting<br/>&gt; JI and EDOs), but how well it does, and the amount of work that went into<br/>the<br/>&gt; design.</p><p>Yes, all that. They&apos;ve covered a ton of stuff that I usually don&apos;t care<br/>about, and can understand quickly when I do.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m wasn&apos;t sure if this is what you meant, and I&apos;m sorry if this sounds<br/>like criticism.</p><p>It&apos;s a mailing list. Criticize away! But no, I didn&apos;t take it badly.</p><p>&gt; I suppose there&apos;s a typo? Or did you mean a pythagorean minor chord?</p><p>Sorry, I was still thinking about 31 EDO when I wrote that. E\!/ G\!/ B\!/<br/>would be a pythagorean minor chord in a temperament that doesn&apos;t temper out<br/>81/80.</p><p>&gt; Hm ... while using the diatonic scale as a notation basis works, I&apos;d<br/>recommend to<br/>&gt; use a 7-, 10- or 13-note W&uuml;rschmidt MOS as a basis scale, and an<br/>accidental for<br/>&gt; the chroma instead, if you really want to *think* in this temperament.</p><p>Yes, I could do that, too, and that would make sense most of the time.<br/>Wurschmidt is funny because it&apos;s *so* improper. In this case, I&apos;m thinking<br/>of using it for an idea I had a while back -- using the same basic chord<br/>sequence, but with thirds shifting from subminor to supermajor as the piece<br/>progresses.</p><p>&gt; You can even do this with Sagittal notation if you specify a tuning, and<br/>&gt; use two key signatures:<br/>&gt; One that uses Sagittal accidentals to get W&uuml;rschmidt[7], and a second key<br/>signature<br/>&gt; that contains W&uuml;rschmidt[7] chroma accidentals in case you want to<br/>modulate.</p><p>Interesting, I hadn&apos;t considered that.</p><p>&gt; You&apos;ll laugh, but that&apos;s what I wanted to do starting yesterday. :)</p><p>Synchronicity! I *am* laughing.</p><p>&gt; I finally* finished programming my microtonal Vocaloid 3 plugin</p><p>Cool! Never used Vocaloid, but any tuning plug-ins for a voice synthesizer<br/>would be pretty cool.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3><a id=106286 href="#106286">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2013 11:46:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 09/05/2013 02:35 PM, gedankenwelt94@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; However, from what I think I remember having read about Sagittal notation, much<br/>&gt; thought<br/>&gt; was put in the choice of accidentals, commas that can usually be ignored, and<br/>&gt; for which<br/>&gt; EDO the patent val or a subgroup mapping is used.
