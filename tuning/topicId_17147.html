This article appeared in<br/>21Century Music... I get the e-mail version.  Please don&apos;t tell Mark<br/>Alburger I am reproducing this.</p><p>This is strictly for (un)fair use and research purposes.  (Yes, it&apos;s<br/>long, but not for fast &quot;scrollers&quot;)</p><p>.......</p><p>Dean Drummond is a composer, conductor, multi-instrumentalist, music<br/>instrument inventor, co-director of Newband and Director of the Harry<br/>Partch Instrument Collection.  Born in 1949 in Los Angeles, Drummond<br/>received degrees in music composition from the University of Southern<br/>California (Bachelor of Music, 1971) and California Institute of the<br/>Arts (Master of Fine Arts, 1973).  While a student, he studied<br/>trumpet<br/>with Don Ellis and John Clyman, composition with Leonard Stein, and<br/>worked as musician for and assistant to Harry Partch, performing in<br/>the premieres of Partch&apos;s Daphne of the Dunes, And on the Seventh Day<br/>Petals Fell in Petaluma, and Delusion of the Fury, as well as on both<br/>Columbia Masterworks recordings made during the late 60&apos;s.  In 1976,<br/>Drummond moved to New York, where he co-founded Newband the following<br/>year with flutist Stefani Starin.   Since 1977, Drummond has been<br/>engaged in a multi-faceted career including composition, hundreds of<br/>performances, recordings, production of Harry Partch&apos;s music theatre<br/>works, encouragement and education of composers interested in new<br/>microtonal resources, and many educational activities for children.</p><p>I met Dean Drummond at his guest accommodations in a decidedly<br/>downscale San Francisco hotel on Saturday, September 25, 1999 -- two<br/>days after his amazing concert of Harry Partch&apos;s and his own music at<br/>Yerba Buena Center.</p><p>ALBURGER:  Nice to see they&apos;re putting you up in such style.</p><p>DRUMMOND:  Yes!</p><p>ALBURGER:  At least the concert certainly had style.</p><p>DRUMMOND:  Now of course it&apos;s a bit of a blur.   We have performed<br/>some of those pieces so many times that I can&apos;t remember specific<br/>performances so well.   I did think the performance of my<br/>Congressional Record was one of our best.</p><p>ALBURGER:  How does your personal record begin?</p><p>DRUMMOND:  I got started by signing up for trumpet when band was<br/>offered in 4th grade (Los Angeles City School District) and by<br/>listening to my parent&apos;s collection of 78&apos;s and LP&apos;s.</p><p>ALBURGER:  What music was important to you then?</p><p>DRUMMOND:  When I &quot;discovered&quot; Louis Armstrong&apos;s Hot Five, I was<br/>about<br/>ten and knew that music was extremely important.  I quickly became<br/>interested in bebop and the innovative jazz of the late 50&apos;s and<br/>early<br/>60&apos;s, also in Stravinsky, Bart&oacute;k, and others.</p><p>ALBURGER:  How did you begin composing?</p><p>DRUMMOND:  I can&apos;t remember exactly how I began to compose.   My<br/>earliest memory is improvising, pretty crudely, at the piano, and<br/>then<br/>trying to write down the best part of the improvisation.    I guess I<br/>have always been an organizer and as early as middle school, I spent<br/>my allowance on jazz band arrangements by Dizzy Gillespie and others<br/>and attempted to organize readings.   Since I could never assemble<br/>exactly the right musicians,  I would have to arrange and transpose<br/>the parts for the instruments we had.   That&apos;s another way that I got<br/>started composing.</p><p>ALBURGER:  How did you hook up with Don Ellis?</p><p>DRUMMOND:  While in high school, I chanced to see an ad placed by Don<br/>Ellis offering trumpet and jazz lessons.   I remember I was about to<br/>turn 16 because I was just learning to drive and it was big deal to<br/>drive one hour each way across Los Angeles -- from San Pedro to the<br/>San Fernando Valley -- for a trumpet lesson.</p><p>ALBURGER:  What was it like to study with him?</p><p>DRUMMOND:  It was great.  I give Don credit for introducing me to a<br/>lot, from Luciano Berio to Indian music, from Leonard Stein with whom<br/>I studied species counterpoint to Harry Partch, who became my main<br/>mentor and a great inspiration.</p><p>ALBURGER:  So it was through Ellis that you met Harry Partch?</p><p>DRUMMOND:  Yes.  I was still 16 (in the fall 1965) when Don loaned me<br/>the Gate 5 recording of Revelation in the Courthouse Park and gave me<br/>a number to call to attend one of Harry Partch&apos;s rehearsals.   I<br/>called and ended up attending a demonstration of the instruments,<br/>mostly by Emil Richards, attempting to enlist some young studio<br/>percussionists to play Harry&apos;s music.  I was absolutely blown away by<br/>the instruments, by the demonstration and by Harry himself, who<br/>wouldn&apos;t answer any of my many questions and told me to read his<br/>book.<br/>   It was easy to see that musicians were needed.  I, probably<br/>naively, expressed interest in playing and left my number.   A couple<br/>months later, Harry called and asked me to play in what turned out to<br/>be the premiere of And on the Seventh Day Petals Fell in Petaluma,<br/>which happened during May 1966.  During the summer after Petals, I<br/>tried to help Harry organize some rehearsals of Delusion of the Fury<br/>but it proved to be a premature attempt.  I also helped Harry a<br/>little, driving him on  errands.   By this time, I had read his book<br/>-- some of it twice -- and also we got into huge discussions in which<br/>I would basically pick his brain or we would discuss the meaning of<br/>corporeality: what was corporeal and what wasn&apos;t.  In the fall of<br/>1966, I began studies at University of Southern California and didn&apos;t<br/>see much of Harry until he called me and invited me to serve as his<br/>assistant the following year at University of California at San<br/>Diego.<br/> The next year was one of the most amazing of my life.  Along with<br/>Jonathan Glasier, I assisted Harry throughout the year with tuning,<br/>minor instrument repairs, rehearsal organization, and played in the<br/>performances that were done that year, including the first<br/>performance<br/>of Daphne of the Dunes.  I had a pretty light schedule of classes at<br/>UCSD which made me willing and even eager to hang out with Harry as<br/>much as possible, which sometimes meant driving all over for a<br/>particular hardware supply and sometimes to check out reed organs.<br/>The following year Harry&apos;s position at UCSD evaporated and there was<br/>no reason for me to be there.  I moved back to L.A. and resumed<br/>studies at USC.  For continued participation with Harry, it ended up<br/>being the right move though.  Harry also moved to L.A. to organize an<br/>ensemble to perform at the Whitney Museum in New York during the fall<br/>(1968) and then to perform the first performances of Delusion of the<br/>Fury (possibly his greatest work) at UCLA the following Spring.<br/>What<br/>can I say?   It doesn&apos;t get much better than getting to go to New<br/>York<br/>with Harry Partch when you&apos;re 19 years old and then play in Delusion<br/>of the Fury and make two records for Columbia Masterworks to boot!</p><p>ALBURGER:  Sounds about right.  So what did your music sound like<br/>during these years?<br/>DRUMMOND:  My music sounded like what you might expect: eclectic and<br/>immature, not very original.   The reasons were pretty simple: I was<br/>young and I had spent a year devoted to Harry while still practicing<br/>trumpet for hours per day, and wasn&apos;t doing much with composing or my<br/>other studies at USC.</p><p>ALBURGER:  But after that, your lives went different directions?</p><p>DRUMMOND:  Yes.  I stayed in Los Angeles and at USC, never worked<br/>with<br/>Harry again, but drove down to visit him periodically, probably five<br/>or six times per year until around 1973.   I didn&apos;t see him much<br/>during the last year of his life because I was having my own<br/>difficulties: a too early marriage breaking up, first year out of<br/>college and facing the facts of life about how much time it takes to<br/>earn money, etc.  I was just getting settled in a cottage in<br/>Hollywood<br/>after moving out of the apartment I had shared with my ex-wife when<br/>my<br/>father called to tell me that he read about Harry&apos;s death in the<br/>paper.  But that&apos;s getting a little ahead; back in 1969 I decided<br/>that<br/>with no performances on the horizon, I was better off in LA.   Also I<br/>really wanted to compose again and was beginning to increasingly feel<br/>that Harry was too big an influence in my life, that I had to learn<br/>about a lot of music and come to more of my own ideas of what was<br/>important to me.   As I started to do this, I also came to a major<br/>realization, which was I couldn&apos;t devote myself to composition and<br/>trumpet and do either as well as wanted.   This was a very sudden<br/>decision, but one that I have never regretted.   I still remember<br/>clearly.   For the first time in my life, I considered quitting<br/>trumpet on January 2, 1970, thought about it for about 48 hours and<br/>then did it.   When I was sure, Harry was the first person I called<br/>to<br/>discuss my decision.   He thought it was great.  Sure enough, it paid<br/>off for me.   With more focus, determination and time, I began to<br/>write pieces almost immediately that still sound acceptable.   Still<br/>eclectic, still not really original, but at least growing in a<br/>direction.   I still like some of the pieces I composed between 1970<br/>and 1973, but I think my first original sounding piece was in 1974:<br/>Cloud Garden I, which I completed just after graduating from Cal<br/>Arts.<br/> Any time I got a tape, I would play it for Harry on my next visit.<br/>He was always encouraging, but always frank.  There was one piece he<br/>really liked a lot (Dedication) and one he openly criticized or at<br/>least said it made no sense to him (Ghost Tangents).  It&apos;s always<br/>amazed me on a personal level that not only did I compose the first<br/>music I thought was original in 1974, but that Harry knew my first<br/>wife pretty well, but didn&apos;t know we had separated, and certainly<br/>didn&apos;t know that I would meet Stefani Starin, my second and current<br/>wife a month after he died... and I also didn&apos;t get to play him Cloud<br/>Garden I.  To the best of my knowledge, my relationship with Harry<br/>was<br/>pretty unique through all of these years, 1966 to about 1972.   I&apos;m<br/>pretty sure I was the only member of his ensembles that had read<br/>Genesis of a Music cover to cover several times, frequently discussed<br/>and even argued (friendly) over some of the concepts -- also I&apos;m<br/>pretty sure I was the only young composer who was showing Harry<br/>his/her work during those years.  One more thing comes up because I<br/>recently reread Bob Gilmore&apos;s account of the one class that Harry<br/>taught at UCSD.   Of course everyone will have their own perception<br/>of<br/>what went on, but my memory differs a little bit with Harry&apos;s and<br/>some<br/>of the students.   Harry blamed the students a bit for disinterest,<br/>etc., but I believe that Harry, despite having the ability to explain<br/>himself brilliantly in Genesis of a Music, just didn&apos;t have the<br/>experience to teach effectively in the classroom.  While it&apos;s true<br/>that the music faculty and some students didn&apos;t give Harry the<br/>respect<br/>that I believe he deserved, creating some bitterness along the way, I<br/>think the students who signed up for his class did so out of interest<br/>mixed with an understandable level of misunderstanding and innocence.</p><p>They were all graduate students and good musicians, but there was a<br/>definite communication gap mostly caused, I believe, by the fact that<br/>Harry didn&apos;t really get into the role of educator, understanding what<br/>his students knew and didn&apos;t know, and then building cohesively from<br/>there.   This actually worked out very much to my advantage since I<br/>was asked to set up a series of sessions in which I tried to explain<br/>to these students what Harry was trying to explain, a task that very<br/>much challenged me to clarify my own understanding at the time.  What<br/>else can I say about Harry that hasn&apos;t been said?   He was a great<br/>friend despite the age difference.   He could be difficult,<br/>cantankerous, sometimes impossible, but he was almost always<br/>brilliant, interesting, inspiring, even incredible.   I loved him<br/>dearly.</p><p>ALBURGER:  He is dearly missed.  After his death, you eventually<br/>wound<br/>up staying in New York for much more than a recording session.</p><p>DRUMMON:  Ever since I was 12, I dreamt of coming to New York, mostly<br/>because it was the center for jazz.   The trip with Harry in 1969<br/>whet<br/>my appetite further.   I had very little professional reason to be in<br/>L.A.  I was earning my living as a bookkeeper, which I could do<br/>anywhere.  Teachers at Cal Arts, like John Bergamo, had come from New<br/>York and had made it sound great.  Finally, I had a girlfriend,<br/>Stefani, who had grown up outside of New York, hated L.A., and wanted<br/>to leave as soon as she completed her degree at Cal Arts.  The<br/>clincher was that I got a Fellowship in Composition to Tanglewood.<br/>They were going to send me a round-trip plane ticket, but I asked for<br/>the cash equivalent and paid for Stefani and myself to ship half of<br/>our belongings by Greyhound and then we drove across the country with<br/>the other half on top of our little Datsun.  After Tanglewood,<br/>Stefani<br/>and I were allowed to stay on briefly in the composer&apos;s cottage.<br/>After a brief period in which we considered moving to Boston, we<br/>started looking for jobs and an apartment in New York and moved to<br/>the<br/>city in December, 1976.</p><p>ALBURGER:  And eventually in New York, you founded Newband.</p><p>DRUMMOND:  Yes.  It didn&apos;t take long to understand that New York<br/>didn&apos;t have a support system for immigrant artists.   If Stefani<br/>wanted to perform and I wanted to have my pieces played, we needed to<br/>hustle our own gigs instead of hoping the phone would ring.   During<br/>the spring of 1976, I sent out a bunch of letters proposing a concert<br/>of music composed by myself and a few friends.   It was quite a<br/>surprise when someone from the programming office at New York<br/>University called up to hire the band, assuming we were cheap, which<br/>we were.   She asked me what the band would be called for publicity<br/>purposes and I thought for a second and said &quot;Newband.&quot;  We were very<br/>fortunate to have encountered some great young percussionists, James<br/>Pugliese, Rick Sacks, and Steve Paysen -- all students of Ray des<br/>Roches at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.   Louis<br/>Goldstein, a great pianist from Cal Arts, was at Eastman, and came<br/>down to rehearse.   We were joined by Allen Blustine, a.k.a.<br/>Devendra,<br/>then and still one of the best clarinetists in New York, and that was<br/>the beginning of Newband.   Even though I was still heavily into<br/>Harry&apos;s music, I was just beginning to construct the first prototype<br/>for the zoomoozophone.   Newband&apos;s first concerts weren&apos;t microtonal<br/>at all.   By 1978, I had completed the first zoomoozophone and that<br/>changed everything.    With a new instrument we had to create a new<br/>repertoire which took several years.    By 1982, Newband mostly<br/>presented a microtonal repertoire.</p><p>ALBURGER:  And eventually you and Newband became the caretaker to the<br/>Partch instruments.</p><p>DRUMMOND:  Becoming caretaker of the instruments was a matter of<br/>great<br/>coincidence.  By around 1988 or 1989, Newband was beginning to come<br/>into its own.  We had performed in some pretty prestigious venues,<br/>been to Europe and had released our first CD.  In 1989, we were<br/>contacted by the Andrew Mellon Foundation and invited to apply for a<br/>large grant that would allow the ensemble to grow.  We were<br/>encouraged<br/>to think of a large project that would help develop those aspects of<br/>our ensemble that made us unique.  One night I had the wild idea that<br/>we should apply for a grant to build the seven Harry Partch<br/>instruments necessary for a performance of U.S. Highball.  With<br/>Danlee<br/>Mitchell&apos;s approval, I applied, and much to our amazement, we got the<br/>grant.  Less than a year later, we were well on our way towards the<br/>completion of two instruments when Danlee arranged to come to New<br/>York<br/>with the instruments for a performance at Juilliard.  I wasn&apos;t<br/>connected to this performance at all, and first heard about it when<br/>David Lang of the Bang on a Can Festival called me to say that he had<br/>asked Danlee if the instruments could stay in New York for a<br/>performance at Bang on a Can.  Danlee was unavailable and made such a<br/>performance contingent on my participation; David was calling to see<br/>if I wanted to.  That led to three performances at Bang on a Can<br/>followed by a period in which I kept checking with Danlee to see if<br/>the instruments could stay for one more performance.   All this time<br/>the instruments occupied a loft on West 31st Street, right underneath<br/>a gigantic laundry that was cleaning all of the linens for several<br/>hotels.   The spin cycles were amazing; the whole building shook.<br/>The<br/>following year (1991), Newband staged The Wayward for eight nights at<br/>Circle in the Square, once again sponsored by Bang on a Can.   It was<br/>a shoestring production, but very exciting nonetheless, directed by<br/>Tom O&apos;Horgan.   Danlee came out from San Diego and asked me if I<br/>would<br/>want to take the instruments on &quot;permanent loan.&quot;   He was getting<br/>ready to retire and didn&apos;t want the pressure of caring for the<br/>instruments.  I was happy to.  As a lot of the instruments needed<br/>renovation, I requested that the Mellon Foundation allow Newband to<br/>spend much of the funds doing that.</p><p>ALBURGER:  In your own works, you now utilize Partch&apos;s instruments,<br/>plus a few of your own.</p><p>DRUMMOND:  I have invented two instruments, the zoomoozophone and the<br/>juststrokerods.  Both were built purposefully to be in tune with<br/>Harry&apos;s instruments.  I have always liked metallic ringing percussion<br/>sounds.   For me the zoomoozophone especially is a great complement<br/>to<br/>Harry&apos;s percussion instruments and goes especially well with diamond<br/>marimba, boo, and also harmonic canons.</p><p>ALBURGER:  It&apos;s so true.  Your workshop the other day very well<br/>demonstrated that.  So what are the pieces that you have written that<br/>are most important to you?</p><p>DRUMMOND:  Well, that&apos;s a difficult question and the answer might<br/>have<br/>been different several years ago as it will probably be different<br/>sometime in the future.   Right now I would say that The Day the Sun<br/>Stood Still is my favorite instrumental piece; The Last Laugh (a live<br/>film score for the silent film of the same name by F.W. Murnau) is my<br/>biggest piece definitely; and Congressional Record is probably the<br/>most fun.  Other favorites are a couple small recent pieces,<br/>especially Mars Face.  My favorite &quot;older&quot; pieces are  Then or Never,<br/>Ruby Half Moon and, really old, Zurrjir (1976).</p><p>ALBURGER:  Speaking of Congressional Record, your style seems denser<br/>and more contrapuntal than Partch&apos;s.  Do you  share this perception?</p><p>DRUMMOND:  Sure.   It seems obvious.  Harry was more interested in<br/>line and less interested in vertical constructions.<br/>ALBURGER:  I understand there was a bit of a scare that the Partch<br/>instruments would not have a proper home?</p><p>DRUMMOND:  Fortunately that&apos;s over.  Housing the instruments has<br/>always been a problem.   It&apos;s a bigger problem now, because we cart<br/>around my instruments, several replications, plus all of the<br/>instruments Harry built at the end of his life which weren&apos;t part of<br/>most of the moves he had to make.  Basically, there are only two ways<br/>that one can provide for the instruments: pay commercial rent or find<br/>a supportive institution.  The second way is in most circumstances<br/>much preferred. During Harry&apos;s lifetime, institutional support (i.e.<br/>at universities), went hot and cold.  After he died, Danlee kept the<br/>instruments at California State University (San Diego), where Danlee<br/>was already a Professor of Music.  When I first took charge, I wasn&apos;t<br/>connected with any institution, and Newband struggled to raise the<br/>money for the loft rent every month.  After 15 years in Manhattan,<br/>Stefani and I and our two children needed much more space than our<br/>apartment, and larger apartments were very expensive.   We moved to<br/>Nyack, a great little village about 30 miles north of Manhattan, and<br/>I<br/>looked for commercial space there.   Amazingly, the local high school<br/>band director, Bert Hughes, knew all about Harry and I was quickly<br/>offered temporary space in an unused room in the high school.   That<br/>lasted two years and then we were invited to be Artist Ensemble in<br/>Residence at Purchase College, State University of New York, by<br/>Donald<br/>Steven, Dean of Music.   Five years later, Donald left and was<br/>replaced by a new dean who immediately asked us to move out.   It<br/>wasn&apos;t much notice, certainly not enough to line up another<br/>institution, although we tried.   We spent a year rehearsing in a<br/>factory warehouse pretty far out of the way in Sloatsburg, New York.<br/> That takes us up to a little more than a month ago when we were<br/>invited by Ruth Rendleman, Chair of the Music Department at Montclair<br/>State University in New Jersey, to move the instruments there.<br/>Things<br/>seem much better at Montclair than at Purchase.  The faculty and<br/>administration, including Susan Cole, President, has been most<br/>supportive.  The bitterness about Purchase seems part of a distant<br/>past now, fortunately.   Montclair is simply a better place to be, a<br/>better university in general, and much more convenient to Manhattan<br/>for musicians and composers traveling to practice and rehearse.</p><p>[Dean Drummond has been hired as Assistant Professor of Music at<br/>Montclair State University and authorized to build a Harry Partch<br/>Institute at Montclair -- a place, finally, where the Partch<br/>instruments will live, and where interested students can receive a<br/>degree studying the late composer&apos;s music]</p></div>
