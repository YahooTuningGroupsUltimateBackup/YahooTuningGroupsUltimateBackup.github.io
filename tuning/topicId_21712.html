The violin embraces<br/>more than a western musical tradition. Indian musicians<br/>adapted the same design minus the chin-rest and absorbed<br/>into their own. Csound, being as an aggregation of features<br/>of many first generation computer music languages that were<br/>the children of Music 4, is based on another western<br/>metaphor for musical production, namely that the composer<br/>writes a score for an orchestra. But Csound like the violin<br/>is also capable of going beyond this eg Bernard Bel&acirc;Â€Â™s<br/>front end called the Bol Processor.</p><p>You said</p><p>&gt;The point is... the analogy of CSOUND with learning to play<br/>a musical<br/>&gt;instrument does not hold water (or sound)...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It becomes not learning to PLAY the instrument, but more<br/>like<br/>&gt;learning to MAKE the instrument!</p><p>Maybe the analogy IS valid simply because it&acirc;Â€Â™s an open<br/>question whether composers working with Csound assume the<br/>roles of the performers (in the sense that its tools allow<br/>the score to be played automatically) and also instrument<br/>makers as well (depending where you choose to draw the line<br/>between orchestration and instrument-making).</p><p>&gt;So what does this have to do with CSOUND?  Well, I think,<br/>basically,<br/>&gt;the composers using it have been just working on their own<br/>projects</p><p>Csound is by nature a software language that is simply an<br/>outgrowth of people working on their own pieces. Those that<br/>I know of probably have other things to do that are more<br/>important to their own personal creative objectives than<br/>creating a tidier work place. Csound is an environment to<br/>which anyone who is prepared to get their hands dirty is<br/>allowed to do so. Understand that and there&acirc;Â€Â™s no<br/>problem, whichever way you like to think about composition.</p><p>&gt;and no one has really taken the AUTHORITY to harbor CSOUND<br/>as a<br/>&gt;releasable product for general use...</p><p>and I know of no group of composers who would feel it is<br/>their responsibility to do this on behalf of other groups of<br/>composers who have a legitimate wish to venture into<br/>unfamiliar musical territory. Generic hardware changes so<br/>rapidly that it difficult to know how much effort an<br/>individual, whether composer or software engineer, will be<br/>required to make to create a friendlier Csound front end.<br/>But the volatility of current technology simply makes the<br/>risk too high for any composer to invest the kind of time on<br/>such a detour from creative work. Unless it is financially<br/>worthwhile for a software engineer I don&acirc;Â€Â™t think it is<br/>going to happen. Those composers who work with Csound<br/>embrace it precisely because it allows a new relationship<br/>with musical instruments. Above all they understand that all<br/>instruments seem have a use-by date, especially those based<br/>on &acirc;Â€Â˜current&acirc;Â€Â™ technology. What motivates me most<br/>as a composer working within the limitations of Csound is<br/>the freedom this software will give me to function as a<br/>composer irrespective of the good fortunes or otherwise of<br/>musical instrument manufacturers.</p><p>BTW, I appreciate your email response. I realise it&apos;s<br/>possible I might have offended you with the tone of my<br/>comparisons between email and text-based Csound interface.<br/>If so I apologise. I do appreciate the time you have given<br/>to sharing your thoughts and ideas.

I should mention, Greg, that I also, back in my<br/>&quot;brown hair&quot; years, ALSO did some small work with MUSIC 4.</p><p>It took me me more than a SEMESTER to write a 10 second piece!</p><p>My point is only that because something is &quot;difficult&quot; or<br/>&quot;unfriendly&quot; it is not, necessarily, &quot;sophisticated.&quot;  It could be<br/>just &quot;difficult&quot; or &quot;unfriendly.&quot;</p><p>Of course, the present version of CSOUND is a GREAT improvement over<br/>the old Music 4, which would only run on computers the size of a<br/>small building!<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; You said<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The point is... the analogy of CSOUND with learning to play<br/>&gt; a musical instrument does not hold water (or sound)...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;It becomes not learning to PLAY the instrument, but more<br/>&gt; like learning to MAKE the instrument!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe the analogy IS valid simply because it&apos;s an open<br/>&gt; question whether composers working with Csound assume the<br/>&gt; roles of the performers (in the sense that its tools allow<br/>&gt; the score to be played automatically) and also instrument<br/>&gt; makers as well (depending where you choose to draw the line<br/>&gt; between orchestration and instrument-making).<br/>&gt;</p><p>You&apos;re right Greg!  And it does seem, as you mentioned in your<br/>original message, that a composer using CSOUND is more akin to some<br/>of our composer list-members who MAKE their own instruments AS WELL<br/>AS compose for them...</p><p>&gt; &gt;So what does this have to do with CSOUND?  Well, I think,<br/>&gt; basically, the composers using it have been just working on their<br/>own projects</p><p>&gt;Csound is by nature a software language that is simply an<br/>&gt; outgrowth of people working on their own pieces.

Just an idea.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if you know Robert yet, but you will if you &quot;hang<br/>around&quot; this list for a bit.  Robert is, essentially, not PRIMARILY a<br/>composer... he&apos;s all kind of great things, one of them being a<br/>software developer who derives great satisfaction from making a<br/>WORKABLE and EASY TO USE product...</p><p>I believe for someone like Robert, the time spent developing<br/>software, particularly if his name were attached to it, and if,<br/>hopefully, there would be at least a small remuneration for it, would<br/>not be a &quot;distraction&quot; from composing time.</p><p>I don&apos;t want to be presumptious and speak for Robert, but I believe<br/>this is just the kind of individual that CSOUND needs... and the kind<br/>of &quot;cleanup.&quot;</p><p>Of course, as Pat Pagano and others have mentioned, one would have to<br/>take great care not to limit the FLEXIBILITY of the CSOUND instrument<br/>during these &quot;improvements.&quot;  I&apos;m not really suggesting a &quot;dumbing<br/>down...&quot; This is more in the avenue of stability and installation,<br/>etc...  I think there probably could be more &quot;front ends&quot; that could<br/>be implimented to do various functions.  I still have to study more<br/>CSOUND (which I *do* intend to do!) before I can be more specific.<br/>At this point, it&apos;s more a general &quot;feel...&quot;</p><p>Does anybody remember how cumbersome it was to use even the first<br/>wordprocessors??  I mean even PRE-DOS-Wordperfect...  Were those<br/>really &quot;flexible...??&quot;  But then, there&apos;s a FAR greater incentive for<br/>somebody to develop software like that for general use than there is<br/>for somebody to make CSOUND more user-friendly.</p><p>I&apos;d like to speak for a brief moment about another &quot;unfriendly&quot;<br/>program that I DID learn: SCORE for the IBM.  Well, SCORE is VERY<br/>flexible, but pretty difficult to learn.  It&apos;s worth the time and<br/>investment, but the FINALE folks really developed their product, made<br/>it friendlier, MIDI controllable (a BIG plus for FINALE over SCORE)<br/>by the way... INEXPENSIVE, and EVENTUALLY, SCORE has, basically been<br/>run out of town!</p><p>Well, Passport Designs dropped it, and it&apos;s now still back in the lap<br/>of Leland Smith and his &quot;San Andreas Press&quot;  (a slightly ironic name<br/>for his small software publishing company... but we get the &quot;drift.&quot;)</p><p>Smith is STILL working on a WINDOWS version of the product!  It&apos;s<br/>still BASICALLY in DOS!</p><p>There is a parallel here... it&apos;s only too bad that some COMPETENT<br/>software engineer hasn&apos;t come to the rescue!  (Smith is only &quot;so-so&quot;<br/>or so I&apos;ve heard... part of the problem that it is taking so long)</p><p>&gt; BTW, I appreciate your email response. I realise it&apos;s<br/>&gt; possible I might have offended you with the tone of my<br/>&gt; comparisons between email and text-based Csound interface.<br/>&gt; If so I apologise. I do appreciate the time you have given<br/>&gt; to sharing your thoughts and ideas. Here am I emailing, not<br/>&gt; Csounding, comment enough.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s OK, Greg!  Well, naturally people don&apos;t like to think they&apos;re<br/>&quot;wasting time&quot; here on the Tuning List!</p><p>So the question is:  have I been composing LESS since I&apos;ve been<br/>spending quite a bit of time on the list??</p><p>The answer:  quite possibly, BUT, what I HAVE been doing has been of<br/>greater interest!  I&apos;ve been getting MORE positive responses about it<br/>(some people... and not tunees, have said the more recent pieces are<br/>by FAR my most interesting). Additionally, I have still been getting<br/>public performances... and, frankly, more enthusiasm from the more<br/>&quot;cutting edge&quot; quarters.</p><p>So, although the Tuning List can be fun, there is very little time<br/>&quot;wasted&quot; here... at least this is MY impression...</p><p>Best,</p><p>Joe</p><p>______ ______ ____ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
