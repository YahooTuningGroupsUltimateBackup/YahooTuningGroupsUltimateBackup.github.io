It&apos;s slightly smaller than the traditional (and much more practical)<br/>32805/32768 schisma ~ 1.953721 cents.</p><p>I&apos;m coming up with these strange intervals using the argument that if X number<br/>of fifths is a good approximant of a certain prime interval such as 5/4, 7/4,<br/>11/8 etc., then X + 53 or X - 53 fifths should work too, and possibly better.<br/>I&apos;m using 53-tet because it has such a great fifth, and it&apos;s easier to handle<br/>than say, 665-tet. That&apos;s how I came up with the inferior septimal schisma based<br/>on 39 fifths, and I&apos;m currently calculating the other prime intervals up to<br/>31/16. (For 53-tone, it&apos;s not really possible to produce a good periodicity-type<br/>just scale using primes higher than 7; at that point one had better use a<br/>symmetrical Farey approximation, and that would result in irregular step sizes<br/>and problematic intervals such as the 17/16 augmented prime/chromatic step.)</p><p>~Danny~</p><p>p.s. I just found a good tredecimal schisma: 3489660928/3486784401, which is<br/>13/8 compared to a chain of 20 perfect fifths, or approximately 1.427644 cents.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Join the world&#xFFFD;s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail.

Using an<br/>asterisk (*) to show the tricomma at around 70.38 cents, we have for<br/>example the wierisma major third F4-G#*4 (schisma m3 plus tricomma);<br/>and the wierisma minor third G#*4-C5 (schisma M3 less tricomma).</p><p>By the way, on your approximation of 13:8 as 20 pure fifths up, this<br/>can easily occur in a regular 24-note Pythagorean tuning (two 12-note<br/>chains a Pythagorean comma apart) in an idiom like this, with the<br/>carat sign (^) showing a note raised by a Pythagorean comma of<br/>531441:524288 (~23.46 cents):</p><p>            C#^4        D4<br/>            F3    E3    D3</p><p>Here the near-13:8 interval F3-C#^4 is followed by the near-12:7 major<br/>sixth E3-C#^4 (a comma wider than the regular Pythagorean sixth<br/>E3-C#4), resolving to the octave D3-D4.</p><p>This is a neat coloristic touch, and one might wonder if<br/>flexible-pitch ensembles in 14th-century Italy or France might have<br/>arrived at something like this progression and intonation at certain<br/>cadences where a vertical augmented fifth seems not unlikely, and the<br/>major sixth before an octave might have been given a size of somewhere<br/>around 12:7. Anyway, I like it very much for related 21st-century<br/>styles.</p><p>To conclude, thank you for your latest messages -- and I agree that<br/>recognizing &quot;wierisma&quot; thirds of 45 fifths up and 44 fifths down would<br/>neatly fit your outlook.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=38900 href="#38900">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawier@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/2002 12:56:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for your input, Margo, though I&apos;m not really trying to get an interval<br/>named after me (yet) ;)</p><p>As an afterthought, I decided that it probably won&apos;t be necessary to use both 5-<br/>and 7-based schismatic adjustments in my 53-tone scale, but it would work in<br/>larger scales. 5:4 is much stronger than 7:4. But 13:8 is strong; it equals 37<br/>steps in 53-tet, or a spiral of 20 fifths, like I stated earlier.</p><p>Now a mix of 5:4 and 7:4 would work in classical tuning, where the 5:4 ratio<br/>equals a chain of four fifths.</p><p>~Danny~ (no more big intervals; my posts are already pretty boring)</p><p>&gt;From: &quot;M.
