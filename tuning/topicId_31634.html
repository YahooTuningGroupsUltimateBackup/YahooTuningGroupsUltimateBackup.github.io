It was (I believe) developed in order to attempt to accurately time the &quot;echo return time&quot; of sonar/radar echos which return highly dispersed in the time domain (as a result of the transmission medium having non-equal &quot;group delay&quot;), as well as possibly returning attenuated relative to other (non-removable) forms of noise which exist within the receive bandwidth of interest. It has been utilized in audio analysis (as well), in order to attempt to extract information regarding any (possibly present) predominant &quot;fundamental frequency&quot; which (may) exist within a spectrum including the contribution of signal sources whose spectra contain &quot;harmonic energy&quot; of some fundamental (which is not apparent from visual inspection of the composite waveform in either the time or the frequency domains).</p><p>&gt; When a fit is found the peaks it covers are removed, replaced<br/>&gt; by the fundamental of the mask.  The mask-fit process is then<br/>&gt; applied again, recursively, until no fit can be found that<br/>&gt; minimizes the function enough.  All this is done in real-time,</p><p>JG: Wow! Try building *that* out of (any) electronic components!!!</p><p>&gt; with all the data (after every iteration) being passed up to<br/>&gt; consciousness at once.</p><p>JG: Such would imply a &quot;sampling&quot; process occuring within the larger process. If one assumes that the repetition rate at which such would occur *must* (by Nyquist&apos;s sampling criterion) be less than 1/2 of the period of 20 KHZ (which is 50 microseconds)in order to avoid the horrible sounds we hear when we digitize an analog waveform with an inadequately low sampling frequency, that means that such an &quot;upload&quot; to the &quot;conciousness&quot; would have to occur every 25 microseconds. From the (limited) reading which I have done on the rates at which individual neurons can operate, it would seem that many, many, (parallel pathwayed) neurons would have to be involved for this to be so. Perhaps there is a neurologist (or a biochemist) reading this who might enlighten us as to the electro-chemical &quot;bandwidths&quot; of CNS neurons?</p><p>&gt; But we can only pay attention to one or<br/>&gt; two things at once -- &quot;categorical perception&quot; collapses this<br/>&gt; picture into something more manageable, depending on how<br/>&gt; specifically we&apos;re trying to focus our attention.</p><p>JG: But, it seems, that phenomena alone does not a hypothesis make...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Or, would you (and/or Terhardt) simply find the *lowest*<br/>&gt; &gt;frequency component which occurs in the spectrum (which would not<br/>&gt; &gt;appear to *always* be the appropriate selection)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t want to speak for Paul or Terhardt, but I would answer, &quot;no&quot;.</p><p>JG: Sounds reasonable to me. One (it seems) could easily fashion numerous complicated frequency spectrums (even ones that contain *no* non-harmonic energy, at all) where it would (appear to) be very hard for either a mathematician, an oscilloscope, a spectrum analyzer, or even a &quot;cepstrum analyzer&quot; (as previously described) to &quot;resolve&quot; a single and indisputable &quot;fundamental frequency/period&quot; from the veritable &quot;forest&quot; of (never fully resolvable) spectral lines existing at integer multiples of the *various* fundamental frequency components which would be and are present in &quot;complex&quot; composite musical signals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Isn&apos;t such a process (of second-guessing the &quot;aural mind&quot;) an<br/>&gt; &gt;implicitly subjective conceptual exercise, thus prone<br/>&gt; &gt;to &quot;falsifiability&quot;???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you mean prone to not being falsifiable?</p><p>JG: No, I mean &quot;falsifiable&quot; (in the sense of averements of fact in general which could be deduced from other &quot;assumptions&quot; which can be shown to be implicitly subjective, and/or inaccurate, and/or unknowable).</p><p>&gt; The answer to that<br/>&gt; question is &quot;no&quot;.

Why not &quot;biorhythms&quot;, or &quot;astrology&quot;, or &quot;divine providence&quot;, or &quot;your brand of toothpaste&quot;? For all we (would then) know, any of these are (it seems) similarly qualified to be considered as a qualifying factor!?!</p><p>&gt; Non-falsifiable statements aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; necessarily wrong,</p><p>JG: Would not a &quot;non-falsifiable statement&quot; (hypothesis, or averement)in fact, be an actual candidate *for* the status of a &quot;truism&quot;?</p><p>&gt; though, or even unjustified -- they just aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; as strong or significant as falsifiable ones.</p><p>JG: Carl, our definitions of the phrase &quot;non-falsifiable statement&quot; must (certainly) be exactly 180 degrees out of phase here!

Simple stuff,<br/>and not necessarily un-scientific.</p><p>&gt;Therefore, my speculations (I&apos;ll speak for myself :), no matter<br/>&gt;how fond I may become of them (and I have been a &quot;sinner&quot; myself,<br/>&gt;in my time), and no matter how nuch they may *seem* to be &quot;so<br/>&gt;right&quot;, can never be abvanced to the level of a &quot;non-falsifiable&quot;<br/>&gt;hypothesis.</p><p>I&apos;m still not sure I get your use of &quot;falsifiable&quot; and &quot;non-<br/>falsifiable&quot;.  Where I&apos;m from, non-falsifiable means weak,<br/>falsifiable means strong.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure how you could show that some psychoacoustic<br/>prediction refers to an unknowable phenomenon.  In certain<br/>formal systems, you can prove that certain statements will<br/>never appear as axioms, but...</p><p>&gt;&gt; If the model predicted that 7:4 was<br/>&gt;&gt; more concordant than 3:2, we could reject it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Great, but this (alone) shows our &quot;adaptivity&quot;, and does<br/>&gt; not speak to the &quot;provability&quot; of hypothesis arising out of<br/>&gt; our speculations in these subjects of the &quot;aural mind&quot;.</p><p>I doubt provability exists for physical systems.  All you can<br/>do is show that one theory works better than another.  If you<br/>can show this, the theories are said to be falsifiable.  If<br/>not, they are non-falsifiable, and some would argue, non-<br/>scientific.</p><p>&gt;&gt; We just take a glance at<br/>&gt;&gt; neuroscience and make sure we can hand-wave something together<br/>&gt;&gt; that sounds reasonable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JG: Well then, who needs &quot;neuroscience&quot; at all! Why<br/>&gt; not &quot;biorhythms&quot;, or &quot;astrology&quot;, or &quot;divine providence&quot;, or<br/>&gt; &quot;your brand of toothpaste&quot;? For all we (would then) know, any<br/>&gt; of these are (it seems) similarly qualified to be considered<br/>&gt; as a qualifying factor!?!</p><p>We pick neuroscience because it provides a better theory of<br/>hearing than biorhythms or toothpaste.  _It_ isn&apos;t unscientific,<br/>it&apos;s our application of music theory to neuroscience that&apos;s<br/>unscientific.  But it beats a scientific application of music<br/>theory to toothpaste!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=31710 href="#31710">ðŸ”—</a>unidala &#x3C;JGill99@imajis.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2001 3:43:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My apologies to Carl Lumma for (in message #31640) &quot;driving home&quot; my mistaken usage of the term &quot;falsifiability&quot;... falsely!</p><p>And to Karl Popper (whom I hope, is not &quot;turning over in his grave&quot; as a result of my faux pas...).</p><p>Thanks to Paul Erlich for presenting the following information (below):</p><p>-- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;unidala&quot; &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JG: Carl, our definitions of the phrase &quot;non-falsifiable &gt;&gt;statement&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;must (certainly) be exactly 180 degrees out of phase here! Please<br/>&gt; &gt;advise me as to how I have misunderstood the concept (a &gt;&gt;possibility)!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think Carl might be referring to Karl Popper&apos;s concept<br/>&gt; of &quot;falsifiability&quot;, which is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A scientific theory is falsifiable if it makes predictions which, IF<br/>&gt; refuted, would prove the theory false.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So Carl is saying that non-falsifiable theories are not very &gt;strong,<br/>&gt; since they make so few specific predictions, that there is no<br/>&gt; conceivable way that a new piece of evidence could be found that<br/>&gt; contradicts a prediction of the theory.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The best scientific theories both (a) are falsifiable and (b) have<br/>&gt; not been proven false despite intensive experimental investigations<br/>&gt; on the veracity of their predictions.</p><p>J Gill</p></div>
