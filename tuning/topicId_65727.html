Why shouldn&apos;t other cultures have the same license to reject the upper parts of the harmonic series as soon as it gets in the way of their theory? There have been other other explanations of the sruti, as eg by a violin player in the 1930s (exact documentation securely stowed away on the hard disk of a defunct computer) who had his playing measured and argued very strongly for a 6/7, 7/5 and 7/4. (The same writer also explained that the sruti count for scales is not about the intervals between, but the number of sruti to arrive at a tone, so that it&apos;s not Sa (4) Ri (3) Ga (2) Ma, but [Ni] 4-&gt; Sa 3-&gt; Ri 2-&gt; Ga. Clearly the consensus here neglects some traditions.)</p><p>klaus</p></div>
