To<br/>frame what I have said on this thread (and this thread only) as science is<br/>foolish.  What I have offered is that of an informant, a practitioner in<br/>professionally performing microtonal music.  Call me on the telephone and I<br/>will sing for you a 7/4 or 5/4 accurate to the cent.  Will you be able to<br/>determine the accuracy?  Does it matter to me?  No...chewing my<br/>cake...because nothing has changed for me in these posts.  Only younger<br/>microtonalists grasping at the facts.</p><p>&gt; Whatever, would somebody who&apos;s equipped, competent, and driven to do<br/>&gt; so -- preferably without an agenda -- run some measurements and just<br/>&gt; see what there is to see alright already!<br/>&gt;</p><p>I might say &quot;where are the studies&quot; that are supposed to determine what I am<br/>able to hear.

Then you reversed<br/>yourself, but could not explain any better than I could with internet<br/>mailings.  Similarly, if I have been accurate in years of playing and I tell<br/>you what I am hearing, don&apos;t you think it looks naive to me for the argument<br/>to appear artificially, outside of the context of music?</p><p>&gt; Johnny&apos;s accomplishments, reputation (et al) shouldn&apos;t be in doubt.<br/>&gt; However, as he&apos;s also the one who keeps bring this rather provocative<br/>&gt; &apos;I play 1200-tet accurately to the cent&apos; topic back every now and<br/>&gt; again, I also see no reason to shout-down or belittle anyone who might<br/>&gt; honestly question that or someone who might be interested in running<br/>&gt; some measurements to see just what&apos;s what.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I thank those that know my work and have supported my statements.  I note<br/>that no one that has met me and heard me has questioned my veracity, only<br/>newbies.  Now there are some that like the ruckus and rumble of argument in<br/>the form of belittling.

That was not my intent, and I worked carefully to frame the<br/>questions as objectively as possible, certainly as objectively as you<br/>put forth the claims. I note today that you write:</p><p>&gt; To frame what I have said on this thread (and this thread only) as<br/>&gt; science is foolish.</p><p>Two things:</p><p>1. &quot;foolish&quot; is the exact word I once used that you *excoriated* me<br/>for, saying that to use it was to show you great disrespect.

I would hardly, nor would others, call measuring frequency either<br/>unscientific or foolish, maybe just not applicable in this case.</p><p>&gt; I might say &quot;where are the studies&quot; that are supposed to determine<br/>&gt; what I am able to hear.</p><p>...and then...</p><p>&gt; ...if I have been accurate in years of playing and I tell<br/>&gt; you what I am hearing, don&apos;t you think it looks naive to me<br/>&gt; for the argument to appear artificially, outside of the context<br/>&gt; of music?</p><p>No one can measure what you hear (this must be what you meant<br/>by &quot;intent&quot; in your previous posts), but they can certainly measure<br/>what actually comes out of your bassoon or voice, and to an audience<br/>that is what is important. And I believe a couple of people have<br/>suggested analyzing a performce of yours, even your own music<br/>performed by yourself. I would hardly call that &quot;outside of the<br/>context of music&quot;.</p><p>Dan said:</p><p>&gt; Johnny&apos;s accomplishments, reputation (et al) shouldn&apos;t be in doubt.</p><p>To which I heartily agree! Many people on the list owe him big time,<br/>and he has changed the concert scene, for the positive, for<br/>microtonal music for a long time now.</p><p>&gt; However, as he&apos;s also the one who keeps bring this rather<br/>&gt; provocative &apos;I play 1200-tet accurately to the cent&apos; topic<br/>&gt; back every now and again, I also see no reason to shout-down<br/>&gt; or belittle anyone who might honestly question that or someone<br/>&gt; who might be interested in running some measurements to see just<br/>&gt; what&apos;s what.</p><p>Again, agreed.</p><p>&gt; I note that no one that has met me and heard me has questioned my<br/>&gt; veracity, only newbies.</p><p>Well, I think my first posts to the tuning list were in Fall of 1996,<br/>after being involved with microtones since 1971, so I am not in the<br/>newbie camp. You&apos;ve also heard support, but being a concert promoter<br/>and organizer raises the issue as to whether people might not want to<br/>upset you, lest they lose favor. Very understandable, in light of the<br/>somewhat limited opportunities for concertizing in this area of<br/>music. Thankfully, you&apos;ve always had a &quot;big tent&quot; that includes a lot<br/>of performers.</p><p>&gt; IMO, Practical Microtonality is an oxymoron. I&apos;ve made the<br/>&gt; impractical quite practical FOR ME, but it is clearly difficult<br/>&gt; to share without firsthand experiences (in person).</p><p>No, it is important for beginners in this field, and if you would (or<br/>could) look at it from someone else&apos;s perspective besides yourself,<br/>you would clearly be of great help to even more people. If someone<br/>has to come to you and experience your &apos;you&apos;-ness, then maybe a PM<br/>list is a good idea, where others have the ability to share other<br/>ways of making the music with microtones practical. Or, as people do,<br/>they share here.</p><p>As you say, it *is* difficult to imagine being in your shoes. And<br/>maybe difficult for you to imagine other peoples &apos;shoe&apos;-ness.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=24906 href="#24906">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2001 4:48:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Dan Stearns wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Then again, there always JdL&apos;s new list...</p><p>[Johnny Reinhard:]<br/>&gt;Yes, there is a splintering of lists which I think is unfortunate</p><p>Would you prefer that I invite Brian (&quot;flaming&quot;) McLaren to join the<br/>tuning list?</p><p>[Johnny:]<br/>&gt;I suspected that the FAQ work would lead to this fracturing.</p><p>???

I did post an objection early on.<br/>Sorry, if my opinion offends.  I just thought, and still think, that we were<br/>headed for new, uncharted territory as a list due to natural expansion.  I<br/>admit that there were great efforts made to be fair in the FAQs and they are<br/>certainly benign on the face of it.  But it did define our amazing<br/>differences in definitions.  It showed up what some take for granted and<br/>others truly glean.</p><p>Somehow there is too much information for a typical list of this nature, open<br/>and tolerant, if a bit acidic.

It<br/>freezes things so that a line is drawn in the sand.  It is like a supreme<br/>court justices decision which is a split decision.  It would seem like the<br/>cause to inspire splintering.

And<br/>&gt; maybe difficult for you to imagine other peoples &apos;shoe&apos;-ness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Mainly, I agree with you on this last go around.  I guess you&apos;d be surprised<br/>about I love talking about the pedagogy of learning the specific way a<br/>student learns before teaching the entire class new material. But before you<br/>over-read my academic metaphor, I said I AGREE with most all of what you<br/>said.  Unglaublich!</p><p>It is of interest to see how differently people perceive and surely, it&apos;s<br/>important to correctly interpret where they are coming from.  Andy is only<br/>trying to be sure about something he heard about.  Really, the only way I<br/>could vocalize Harry Partch without perfect pitch is because I CAN hear at a<br/>cent.  Once again, there are others who can learn to do this.  I hope to<br/>write more on learning how to hear with more discrimination.  :)</p><p>I guess it all comes down to playing perfect intervals on the bassoon for<br/>someone.  It can&apos;t be done if the player cannot first hear the intervals in<br/>his inner mind.  But then, it&apos;s not a problem.  For the nth time: Analyzing<br/>my compositions will not help in the search for certitude (please, no, the<br/>fear, the dread that my tone deaf ability will be found out).</p><p>I have a whole performing philosophy for music that sometimes involves using<br/>a mental pitch grid from which to relate to in where I place notes.  Keep in<br/>mind that notes enter on different parts of different partials.  The tongue<br/>can block off any number of different articulatives.</p><p>The best way to learn to hear in a similar fashion to the way I hear (and I<br/>was a bad student with Cs) is to keep the opening interval of a microtonal<br/>motive (or melodic pattern).  I remember the ascending neutral third by<br/>recalling an old world&apos;s fair automobile car which outlines the 350 cent<br/>third.  I have Catler&apos;s tune &quot;Hey Sailor&quot; for the 7/4 and tricesimoprimal<br/>tones, in general.  Quartertones, which I consider big, are easy to do, and<br/>work in bebop fashion in improv.  When different tunings give different<br/>vocabulary, they can be combined so that most all sensible interval are<br/>represented.  This is the origin of my assertion that ALL intervals are<br/>microtonal, preferring not to focus too hard on conventional 12-tET for<br/>meaning.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=24914 href="#24914">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2001 9:23:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny Reinhard wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;Dan&apos;s last post showed that he hadn&apos;t followed the thread, as<br/>admitted.
