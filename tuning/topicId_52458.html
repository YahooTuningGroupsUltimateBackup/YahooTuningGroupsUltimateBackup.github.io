Although I was originally playing with a 14-note &quot;beep&quot;<br/>scale, which works better as two interlaced pelogic scales, the smaller<br/>9-note beep subset actually has some nice qualities. The question is<br/>whether it qualifies as a temperament, or just an interesting tuning.<br/>Now that I&apos;ve actually started playing with it, I&apos;m even less certain<br/>about whether it  counts as a temperament! At least it seems more like a<br/>temperament than the anti-pentatonic 8-ET (aka &quot;father&quot;), which is just<br/>plain warped. But it has tetrads that aren&apos;t convincingly close to<br/>either 5-limit or 7-limit, instead having a strange intermediate<br/>character. They&apos;re a bit like added-sixth chords, but not quite.<br/>Whatever they are, it certainly has a lot of them for the size of the scale:</p><p>     (C)= B-----F#<br/>       D-/-\-A /<br/>      / /   \ /<br/> (Ab)= G-----D \<br/>    Bb/-\-F-/-\ C =(B)<br/>     /   \ /   \<br/>    Eb----Bb----F<br/>       Db----Ab =(G)</p><p>Here&apos;s a really brief (30 sec.) excerpt of a work in progress in &quot;beep&quot;<br/>tuning, both the 5-limit and 7-limit TOP versions:</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/beep5.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/beep5.mid</a><br/><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/beep7.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/beep7.mid</a></p><p>As far as I can tell, the 7-limit TOP doesn&apos;t noticeably improve the<br/>&quot;7-limit&quot; consonances over the 5-limit TOP tuning. This may be due to<br/>the fact that 7/4 is a more complex interval, so it&apos;s allowed to deviate<br/>so far from just that it&apos;s not perceived as 7-limit any longer. But both<br/>of the TOP tunings sound reasonably good for such an extreme temperament.</p></div><h3><a id=52462 href="#52462">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2004 11:49:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s a really brief (30 sec.) excerpt of a work in progress<br/>in &quot;beep&quot;<br/>&gt; tuning, both the 5-limit and 7-limit TOP versions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/beep5.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/beep5.mid</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/beep7.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/beep7.mid</a></p><p>Well, I jumped on the WinAmp bandwagon, but when I click on these,<br/>they come up in WinAmp, but they don&apos;t play.
