It<br/>worked reasonably well, but I didn&apos;t like Rosegarden&apos;s<br/>interface as much as Cubasis Audio.  I wish I could find<br/>something like Cubasis Audio on Linux.  I don&apos;t think I got<br/>Rosegarden&apos;s audio functionality to work.  At least, I<br/>didn&apos;t use it, I only wanted a MIDI sequencer.  ZynAddSubFX<br/>can record its audio directly.</p><p>These days, I&apos;ve stopped using Rosegarden because I<br/>upgraded to a version that doesn&apos;t run comfortably on my<br/>machine.  If you have something more powerful to run it on<br/>it should still work for you.  I can see it would be an<br/>advantage to write music in Lilypond, then bounce it into<br/>Rosegarden to edit and clean up the performance, and maybe<br/>bounce it back into Lilypond for printing.  I haven&apos;t<br/>looked into hacking Rosegarden to work with different<br/>notations.</p><p>&gt; I was thinking of compiling a list of different Linux<br/>&gt; DAWs and seeing how they compare with the following<br/>&gt; features</p><p>I&apos;m still not sure what a DAW is.

But it&apos;s possible to run a LADSPA<br/>to VST bridge.  I see there&apos;s been movement on this front:</p><p><a href="http://linux-sound.org/plugins.html">http://linux-sound.org/plugins.html</a></p><p>DSSI was an unimaginative format that duplicated the MIDI<br/>pitch model.  That&apos;s fine if you&apos;re working with MIDI, of<br/>course, all you do is lie about what the pitches mean and<br/>tune at the synth level.  But what would be really nice is<br/>to have a synth format that took flexible pitches and so<br/>that you could do the tuning at a higher level.</p><p>&gt; MIDI<br/>&gt; 1) has MIDI sequencing support<br/>&gt; 2) has MIDI realtime recording support</p><p>I remember Rosegarden being the only thing I could find to<br/>do these adequately.
