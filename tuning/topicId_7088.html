From what I&apos;ve read, England seems to have been<br/>&gt; the last country in Europe to generally adopt 12-EDO,<br/>&gt; and so perhaps he was really making a legitimate push for<br/>&gt; it here.  But he certainly would have appreciated a more<br/>&gt; inventive approach to building instruments, because he<br/>&gt; clearly preferred 19-EDO.</p><p>Reading that last sentence again made me think back to<br/>a little more than a year ago, when I was at the Sonic<br/>Arts Gallery, and had daily access to Ivor Darreg&apos;s<br/>19-EDO guitar.  Besides the fun I was having exploring<br/>all the great and weird new instruments in all kinds<br/>of different tunings, I got very interested in that<br/>19-tone guitar and began writing little pieces on it.</p><p>Hearing Neil Haversticks _The Gate_ and especially<br/>_African Stick_ CDs and reading his little book on<br/>19-tET earlier last year first got me interested in<br/>that tuning.  Now it&apos;s nice to know that a mathematician<br/>of Woolhouse&apos;s level choose 19-EDO as the most practical<br/>alternative to 12-EDO.  It&apos;s a tuning I certainly would<br/>like to explore much further.</p><p>Any knowledgeable comments on England&apos;s late adoption<br/>of 12-equal?  (Margo, perhaps...?)  Or how about a<br/>nice plausible chronology of global 12-tET monopolozation?<br/>That would make for a good webpage.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
