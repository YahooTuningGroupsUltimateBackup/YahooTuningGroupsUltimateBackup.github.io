It needs one. The<br/>&quot;double-diesis-flat third&quot;? &quot;Breed&apos;s minor third&quot;?</p><p>So the corresponding intervals relating to fifths are 3^2/2^3 (203.9c) the<br/>major whole tone (or Pythagorean whole tone), and 2^8/3^5 (90.2c) the<br/>Pythagorean semitone (or Pythagorean limma). The ideal t/s ratio is<br/>therefore 2.26 and thus we have 53-tET with excellent fifths where t = 9<br/>and s = 4.</p><p>I find it interesting that the diatonic scale falls out of this formula for<br/>ET&apos;s (EDO&apos;s) with reasonable fifths, N = 5T + 2s where T &gt;= 0 and T/9 &lt;= s<br/>&lt;= 6T/7. i.e. one definition of the diatonic scale might be &quot;that scale<br/>having the maximum notes, with two different step sizes arranged maximally<br/>evenly, which can be constructed in every equal division of the octave that<br/>has reasonable fifths&quot;. Does any other scale with any number of notes fit<br/>this description.</p><p>This suggests the question of whether the analogous thing for major thirds<br/>might be of interest. i.e. &quot;that scale having the maximum notes, with two<br/>different step sizes arranged maximally evenly, which can be constructed in<br/>every equal division of the octave that has reasonable major thirds&quot;.</p><p>So I change x to d and y to B, where B is the number of ET steps in the<br/>approximate Breed minor thirds and d is the number of ET steps in the<br/>approximate minor dieses. And we have N = 3B + 7d, where B &gt;= 0 and 0 &lt;= d<br/>&lt;= B/2.</p><p>So, analogous to the diatonic TTsTTTs we get this weird decatonic scale<br/>that goes<br/>   dBddBdddBd.<br/>Just as the diatonic can also be constructed as a chain of 6 fifths (3T+s<br/>each), the above can also be constructed as a chain of 9 major thirds (B+2d<br/>each). Notice that ddB, dBd and Bdd are all major thirds above.</p><p>In some such ET&apos;s we have the degenerate case where d = 0 and the scale<br/>becomes merely BBB. The simplest non-degenerate case is in 13-tET where B =<br/>2 and d = 1. Of the familiar ET&apos;s that also have reasonable fifths, the<br/>ones that support a nondegenerate version are:<br/>19-tET B=4 d=1 T=3 s=2  (B+2d = 2T)<br/>22-tET B=5 d=1 T=4 s=1  (B+2d = 2T-1)<br/>26-tET B=4 d=2 T=4 s=3  (B+2d = 2T)<br/>29-tET B=5 d=2 T=5 s=2  (B+2d = 2T-1, B=T, d=s)<br/>31-tET B=8 d=1 T=5 s=3  (B+2d = 2T)<br/>34-tET B=9 d=1 T=6 s=2  (B+2d = 2T-1)<br/>37 and above.</p><p>Consider the weird decatonic as cast in 19-tET</p><p>C  C# Db D  D# Eb E  E# F  F# Gb G  G# Ab A  A# Bb B  Cb(C)<br/>*  *           *  *  *           *  *  *  *           * (*)</p><p>Here&apos;s a 5-limit lattice of it</p><p>      E#  Cb<br/>    C#  G#<br/>  A   E<br/>    C   G<br/>  Ab  Eb<br/>E#  Cb</p><p>10 triads with 10 notes.</p><p>Paul E., you might want to examine its available harmonies in 22-tET.

The historical record that<br/>shows us that since the Werckmiester rules were in place, (1681) the syntonic<br/>comma, (21.5 c) seems to be the limit of acceptable tempering for this<br/>interval.  Not to say that it can&apos;t be used wider with today&apos;s ears,<br/>expectation, and equipment,  but I find with my acoustic customers, the 21<br/>cent M3 pushes them  about as far as they can harmonically go.   (yes, the<br/>dim4ths tuned in some of the latter meantones were used musically, but they<br/>didn&apos;t stay in vogue very long.)<br/>    In my tuning work, I have learned that there is a dissonance acceptance<br/>curve to the customer base.  Whereas I would convert approx. 1/3 of new<br/>listeners to &quot;other than ET tuning&quot; when using Thomas Young&apos;s temperament of<br/>1799 for the first departure, I have now found that the latter &quot;Victorian&quot;<br/>style of tuning, which usually limits the F#-A# third to 17 cents, is much<br/>more successful,  (like 95% of first time).  Temperament initiates love the<br/>different sound,  there are voices in a Steinway tuned this way that simply<br/>don&apos;t exist in normal 12 ET.<br/>    Bob Segar just finished a week long recording project here using a tuning<br/>that was<br/>documented to have been in use in the Broadwood factory in 1885.   There were<br/>two pianos in the studio, and I had kept one of them in this Victorian style,<br/>just for experiment, and they chose it over the usual tracking piano, without<br/>knowing that the tuning was different.  It sounded better on everything,<br/>until the last day when the decision was made to transpose one cut down to<br/>Ab.  This was too much, and I yanked it back into ET over the lunch break.<br/>The comment was, &quot;hmm,  ok, that sounds alright, but it sure takes the life<br/>out of this piano........&quot;<br/>   I recently had a successful presentation to the Piano Technician&apos;s Guild&apos;s<br/> national convention on this subject, and actually sold a fair number of our<br/>temperament CDs, (Beethoven on a Kirnberger and Young tuned Steinway D).<br/>Numerous techs told me later that they are finally ready to begin trying the<br/>older temperaments, and I foresee a greatly heightened appreciation for<br/>tonality as we get the sounds out in the public.<br/>   Hope this post is not too &quot;organic&quot; for the number fanatics here, and I<br/>will miss H&apos;stick&apos;s spiritual torch.
