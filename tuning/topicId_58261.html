In C major,  the<br/>dyad Bb and B,  is an &quot;extreme dissonance&quot;.   It&apos;s got &quot;foreign&quot;  pitches<br/>in it,  and it&apos;s highly discordant.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2005 10:45:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Christopher Bailey &lt;chris@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see why it wouldn&apos;t refer to a case of both.

But<br/>C-E-G-A# is not discordant, so it hardly makes sense to slap the<br/>&quot;extreme&quot; label on it. It simply confuses things and spreads<br/>disinformation, as I said.</p></div>
