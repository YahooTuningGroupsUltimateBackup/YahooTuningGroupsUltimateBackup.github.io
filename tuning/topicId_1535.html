The 5ths and 4ths are off just enough that it&apos;s not safe to tune by<br/>&gt;them.</p><p>Do you have a 22ET guitar?  I was only aware of your 20-tone just axe...</p><p>&gt;Many MOS scales are &quot;improper&quot;.  What are some people&apos;s thoughts on MOS vs<br/>&gt;propriety for melodic viability?  The few improper MOS&apos;s I&apos;ve played with<br/>&gt;do seem to have a feeling of unevenness and big skips -- but that also<br/>&gt;contributes to their &quot;exotic&quot; sound.</p><p>You&apos;ll find the &quot;worst&quot; scales sometimes have an exotic sound, and in any<br/>case may be useful.</p><p>Propriety is the basic measurement of a melodic scale.  Rothenberg assures<br/>us that all scales are proper one way or the other.  The other is usually<br/>pretty tricky, since there may be hundreds or thousands of ways to cover an<br/>improper scale with its proper subsets.  Even proper scales are probably<br/>broken down this way as music unfolds over time...  One also has to be<br/>careful, because small (in terms of the rest of the scale?) overlaps may<br/>simply not be noticed.</p><p>The harmonic component of Erlich&apos;s generalized diatonicity is concerned<br/>with covering the scale with consonances.  Propriety may be strongly<br/>influenced or even overpowered by the strong organizing force of harmony,<br/>which is seldom absent in music.</p><p>The real gem of Rothenberg&apos;s theory is the notion of equivalence classes,<br/>which says that the number of distinct melodic scales may be finite.  This<br/>is the part of his theory that had me so excited a few months back.</p><p>For the record, I&apos;ll say that I place little or no stock in maximal<br/>evenness, distributional evenness, Myhill&apos;s property, or any of that.</p><p>&gt;Also, is there any explanation of why melodic symmetry should be important?</p><p>I don&apos;t know of a magic formula that shows why MOS&apos;s work so well, and it&apos;s<br/>probably because they do a number of important things...</p><p>1. If the generator is a strong melodic interval, you&apos;ll have lots of them.<br/>2. Every acoustic interval is always subtends the same number of scale steps.<br/>3. You get symmetry about interval of equivalence (IE) and the generator.</p><p>Notes...</p><p>#1 In fact, you&apos;ll have as many of them as possible.  This satisfies the<br/>demands of an &quot;extended reference&quot; tuning (ref. Boomsliter and Creel) as<br/>well as any fixed scale can.</p><p>#2 This is the killer, and I believe it (and not #3) is the origin of the<br/>&quot;S&quot; in MOS.  Note that the reverse is not true -- every scalar interval is<br/>not the same acoustic size (this would seem true only for ET&apos;s...)!  This<br/>is very important.</p><p>#3 I don&apos;t put much stock in this one.  I put a little stock in symmetry<br/>about the 3/2 (which happens to be the generator in the vast majority of<br/>historical scales), but less than Chalmers or Erlich seem to.</p><p>Keep up the good work!  I love Endangered Species, as do the several people<br/>I&apos;ve played it for.</p><p>C.</p></div>
