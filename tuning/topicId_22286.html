I&apos;m always<br/>neurotically sticking floppies (still) into the computer and copying<br/>stuff...  It&apos;s obsessive, but this time it paid off.  (Sound files,<br/>of course, copied to CD-ROM)</p><p>I hate to say it, but if I were to write a &quot;review&quot; of Scala 2.0 it<br/>would not be very good.  Since I am too absolutely stupid to program<br/>something like this myself, I have great respect for what you have<br/>done!</p><p>However, I believe there is MUCH MORE work to be done before Scala<br/>2.0 is anything near what people expect from a Windows program.<br/>Sorry.</p><p>In the first place, it is painfully evident that this is just a<br/>graphic &quot;GUI&quot; running in the foreground of Scala.  Scala is sitting<br/>there running right underneath it!</p><p>That makes me, as someone with at least a modicum of computer<br/>experience, to want to get rid of the GUI.  I don&apos;t like lipstick<br/>either...</p><p>SUPPOSEDLY the installation of the .dlls is &quot;an easy process...&quot;</p><p>Well, just as in CSOUND, my ineptness has made this a small trial.</p><p>As usual, I write things in my autoexec.bat file, and it never works.</p><p>Finally, I get desperate, and copy ALL the .dlls from the CMD<br/>directory into my Windows system file...</p><p>Well, that will do it.  Still, not at all an optimal process for some<br/>people.</p><p>Whew!  Well, it&apos;s up and running!  So then, what.</p><p>Well, I find the &quot;navigation&quot; process in the GUI to be cumbersome.<br/>It&apos;s not at all like a standard windows file directory finder.</p><p>Without a doubt, both Graham Breed and Robert Walker have figured out<br/>how to do this process in Windows and make it &quot;standard.&quot;  You might<br/>want to confer with them about it.  I have NO TROUBLE loading in<br/>SCALA files from the directory window in Graham Breed&apos;s MIDI RELAY or<br/>Robert Walker&apos;s FRACTAL TUNE SMITHY, even with the large size of the<br/>scale directory.</p><p>With the new SCALA, I couldn&apos;t get this to work.</p><p>Ok, so I already spent a LOT of time on these simple things, and I<br/>DON&apos;T have much time, since I have to restore my entire computer<br/>system...</p><p>So, let me play with the one scale available to me in the &quot;root<br/>directory&quot; of SCALA:  ptolemy.scl.</p><p>Well, since we have been discussing Ben Johnston, this one should be<br/>applicable, no??</p><p>Anyway, since there are not too many .scl files in the directory,<br/>this one loads in OK...</p><p>Here it is.  Of course, it really just looks like the &quot;regular&quot; SCALA<br/>with a face lift.</p><p>I try to copy parts of this file.  &quot;Copy and past&quot; is a RUDIMENTARY<br/>Windows function.  EVERY Windows program does it!!!<br/>(Guys/gals/gui&apos;s, name one that doesn&apos;t for me, please...)</p><p>Scala 2.0 won&apos;t do it.  I guess I have to save the file every time as<br/>a text file.  Even THAT procedure wasn&apos;t immediately evident to me...<br/>I&apos;m sure it&apos;s there someplace... but I really didn&apos;t want to spend<br/>HOURS on a GUI!</p><p>The fact that there is no &quot;copy and paste&quot; in this interface would be<br/>a severe (not minor) inconvenience and setback for me in using<br/>SCALA.  I am FREQUENTLY citing parts of this and that... data about<br/>files.  Since I love e-mail, I send this kind of information to a LOT<br/>of people.  I do this all the time.  I don&apos;t want a whole bunch<br/>of .txt or whatever files in my directories that I have to eventually<br/>delete!</p><p>OK... enough.  As you can see, I&apos;m sticking with 1.7 for now.</p><p>I believe there is a LOT more work to be done before SCALA is a full-<br/>fledged Windows program... perhaps, Manuel, you could consult with<br/>some people whose expertise is in that direction.</p><p>As the &quot;village idiot&quot; around here, I would just remind you<br/>to &quot;consider the source&quot; in this evaluation.</p><p>However, I am a GREAT LOVER of SCALA... as I have mentioned time and<br/>time again, and it pains me to give &quot;bad marks&quot; to your wonderful<br/>product...</p><p>But this new Scala just isn&apos;t doing it for me... sorry.</p><p>with apologies</p><p>___________ ________ _____ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=22540 href="#22540">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/2001 7:31:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve written a program that one can use to copy to clipboard from<br/>SCALA, also paste, and use Windows explorer type Open and Save As,</p><p><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/open_etc/open_etc.zip">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/open_etc/open_etc.zip</a></p><p>Each is a two step process, but will be useful pro-tem until<br/>Gtk is updated to do this.</p><p>Example:</p><p>to copy to clipboard use</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/c">@c</a><br/>Scala commands to show output<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/copy">@copy</a></p><p>Details in the readme file</p><p>It is free source.

It doesn&apos;t have<br/>the exact same &quot;look and feel&quot; of a normal Windows program<br/>because the GUI toolkit is multiplatform as Robert mentioned.<br/>In fact the Windows version is more or less only a byproduct.<br/>This toolkit, GTK+ is developed primarily for Linux and<br/>therefore works much better with Linux and Unix.<br/>Every time after some development that I do a new Windows<br/>compilation, I&apos;m disappointed about the things that don&apos;t<br/>work as expected. Still, given the idiosyncrasies of Windows,<br/>I&apos;m surprised that it works as well as it does and am hopeful<br/>that it will be better in the future. The spectacular aspect<br/>for me is that I can make versions for different platforms<br/>__without changing a single line of code__!!<br/>Now try to adapt a regular Windows program to Linux...</p><p>&gt;In the first place, it is painfully evident that this is just a<br/>&gt;graphic &quot;GUI&quot; running in the foreground of Scala.  Scala is sitting<br/>&gt;there running right underneath it!</p><p>I think you&apos;re referring to the DOS window that&apos;s opened aside.<br/>This is not the old Scala running underneath. It is needed to write<br/>any error messages to. The GUI code sometimes does this. And<br/>if an exception occurs (this can happen when there&apos;s a bug), I<br/>will know exactly at which line of code in which module it occurred,<br/>in many cases making repair possible without even knowing what<br/>somebody did. Compare this to regular error messages like<br/>&quot;fatal exception at 0f43&quot; where it&apos;s still uncertain that 0f43<br/>is the place where the bug actually is.</p><p>&gt;I believe there is a LOT more work to be done before SCALA is a full-<br/>&gt;fledged Windows program... perhaps, Manuel, you could consult with<br/>&gt;some people whose expertise is in that direction.</p><p>This is not my priority. I&apos;m still hoping that I can throw<br/>Windows out the door at some point in time.</p><p>&gt;However, I am a GREAT LOVER of SCALA... as I have mentioned time and<br/>&gt;time again, and it pains me to give &quot;bad marks&quot; to your wonderful<br/>&gt;product...</p><p>Don&apos;t worry, no hurt.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=22735 href="#22735">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>5/14/2001 5:55:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe Monzo wrote:</p><p>&gt;I only have one major problem: the main window is showing<br/>&gt;everything in a proportional font (my regular Windows default<br/>&gt;is set to Arial), and I can see no way to change it to<br/>&gt;a non-proportional font, which is what it has to be to<br/>&gt;make all the tables and lattices line up correctly.<br/>&gt;How can this be fixed?</p><p>One of two things can be wrong: 1.

The new &quot;interface&quot; is pretty &quot;clunky...&quot;  It&apos;s<br/>not Manuel&apos;s fault... I believe it&apos;s the &quot;universal&quot; programming<br/>system that he&apos;s using.</p><p>He means, I believe, the capacity to scroll the text in the screen up<br/>and down, unbroken by the &lt;enter&gt; command.</p><p>It would be GREAT if version 1.7 could be updated to do that, too.</p><p>Robert Walker also added significant Windows implementation... as you<br/>will find in the recent archives... to open files for BOTH versions.<br/>(And to copy the screen text for 2.0 which is a necessary function<br/>that is not present... at least I think it&apos;s necessary...)</p><p>________ _________ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=24412 href="#24412">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>6/6/2001 4:51:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl wrote:</p><p>&gt;I have tried 2.0; what do you mean by scroll back?<br/>&gt;You could always scroll back, you just couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;see the commands.</p><p>Yes, under Windows NT and X-windows it is possible,<br/>but not under Windows 95.<br/>I can continue making console versions.
