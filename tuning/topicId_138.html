It would mean<br/>if I go back to subscribing from my Psion 3a, I can ignore it.</p><p>I don&apos;t think use of things like italicization is a good reason to use HTML,<br/>though.  Plain text subscribers shouldn&apos;t be denied messages because the<br/>authors decide to use some italics.  Now, XML, there&apos;s an idea: standard<br/>formats for staff notation and mathematical equations.</p><p>I still expect I&apos;d be more likely to put another page on my website than<br/>spend time formatting an HTML page and recording sound examples for a<br/>mailing list.  A lot more people will be able to view the web page for a<br/>start.  But then, I have a permanent connection at work, so I don&apos;t have to<br/>dial up for FTP.  As for the Usenet, well, I don&apos;t have time for that!</p><p>Two reasons why a mailing list might have more bandwidth problems than web<br/>pages:</p><p>1) When you&apos;re ISP gets the e-mail, it sits around on their server until you<br/>delete it.  A few large messages and you can eat into their disk space.  A<br/>website only takes up disk space on the server that hosts it (and any that<br/>cache it).</p><p>2) The chances are, most people aren&apos;t going to listen to all the examples.<br/>From a web page, you only have to download the links you click on.  And<br/>before you do, you can think &quot;Do I really want to download a 5 minute Real<br/>Audio feed?&quot;</p><p>But it might work.</p><p>MPEG-3 is better than .wav: the files should be smaller, and it&apos;s<br/>standardised enough.</p><p>Now, pitch bends:  Usually the standard range is called &quot;2 semitones&quot;<br/>although it covers 4 semitones.  This became a standard with General MIDI.<br/>All soundcards I&apos;ve come across have a 2 semitone range on power up.<br/>Presumably, they must have to be Sound Blaster or GM compatible.  There are<br/>also RPNs with GM for changing the pitch bend range.  These are not so<br/>widely implemented.</p><p>Finally, I&apos;ve added stuff on temperaments to my website :<br/><a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/meantone.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/meantone.htm</a> and so on.</p></div><h3>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/1999 5:00:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Now, XML, there&apos;s an idea: standard<br/>&gt; formats for staff notation and mathematical equations.</p><p>   I&apos;ve never heard of XML.  What&apos;s it all about?.<br/>.<br/>.</p><p>&gt;  As for the Usenet, well, I don&apos;t have time for that!</p><p>   Huh?  Why exactly do you perceive reading newsgroups as any more<br/>time-consuming than reading Email?.<br/>.<br/>.</p><p>&gt; 1) When you&apos;re ISP gets the e-mail, it sits around on their server until you<br/>&gt; delete it.  A few large messages and you can eat into their disk space.  A<br/>&gt; website only takes up disk space on the server that hosts it (and any that<br/>&gt; cache it).</p><p>   Apparently I&apos;m missing something here.  Either takes up space on a server,<br/>so what&apos;s the difference, other than the fact that Email gets automatically<br/>deleted thereby ensuring that it takes space for a shorter time?.<br/>.<br/>.</p><p>&gt; And<br/>&gt; before you do, you can think &quot;Do I really want to download a 5 minute Real<br/>&gt; Audio feed?&quot;</p><p>   I wasn&apos;t envisioning 5-minute recordings on this supplemental list, although<br/>I suppose people could do that.  I was envisioning more like:</p><p>   Blahblahblah 5:4, blahblahblah 81:64.  For comparison, here&apos;s that passage<br/>using a 5:4 &lt;3-second audio file&gt;, and here&apos;s that same passage using 81:64<br/>&lt;3-second audio file&gt;.</p></div>
