Thanks so much! The quality of the gifs is great.<br/>&gt; You must have saved them at higher than 72ppi.</p><p>A bit over 140 ppi. Actually, exported them to a Windows format<br/>metafile, then set its width to 1200 pixels, which works out as<br/>over 140 ppi for A4.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s beautiful what you did with it. Seems that you found &quot;the<br/>&gt; pattern&quot; quickly. There&apos;s an innate pattern in every scale, that is<br/>&gt; only revealed by playing the scale. You tapped the essense.</p><p>Thanks. It wrote itself pretty much...</p><p>&gt; I wonder how diffcult it might be to create a MOS animation, which<br/>&gt; would be fed with a data table of hundreds fourth generators ranging<br/>&gt; between 2/5 and 3/7 octave, whilst showing graphically, how as the<br/>&gt; size of the generator grows or shrinks, how this affects the size of<br/>&gt; scale degrees? Perhaps even treating the 2/5 to 3/7 as a 360 degree<br/>&gt; rotation. It would be an interesting visualization, as one could see<br/>&gt; how the roles of the scale degrees changes relative to the generator<br/>&gt; size. I can see this in my mind!</p><p>&gt; Erv Wilson says &quot;it passes through the looking glass&quot;. So cool!</p><p>Yes, a nice idea! It could be done in FTS very easily, by just animating the<br/>New Scale window while sliding from one generator to another.</p><p>Or one could make a special new window to show the animation<br/>and could then easily do the 360 degree idea as well, with<br/>each scale corr. to radial line.</p><p>Could also do same with two generator trivalent scales - set up<br/>the pairs of generators for each end, and continually change<br/>one into the other - in that case, you have two generators to<br/>change, so you need to change both simultaneously - could<br/>just do linear interpolatation between the two ends, to show<br/>one way of getting from one to the other.</p><p>You&apos;d set a max number of notes for the scale, say, 12.<br/>Then when there are no 12 tone scales available, but some<br/>with smaller numbers of notes, the animation would show those<br/>instead.</p><p>Also, could do so that you can press, say, &apos;S&apos; at any point,<br/>to pause the animation and hear the scale played, so you<br/>can hear how it varies during the animation.</p><p>Or for the case where you see them all in a single image,<br/>you just click anywhere on the image to hear the corresponding<br/>scale.</p><p>I&apos;ll add it to my 1.10 &quot;to do&quot; list.</p><p>Would be nice to be able to do an animated gif as well.<br/>Have to see how it goes, and how easy it is.</p><p>Maybe if FTS makes the bitmaps, there&apos;s some program<br/>to automatically combine them all into a single animated<br/>gif.</p><p>Great!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
