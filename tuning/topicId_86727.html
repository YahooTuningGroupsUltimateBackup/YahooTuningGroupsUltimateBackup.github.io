It&apos;s really a very versatile thing, with a selection of historical and modern instruments, and lots of parameters to tweak. I used the Schantz pianoforte with a 20-ET Scala file to play my old 20-ET etude from 1999, and it sounds nice even though the MIDI file doesn&apos;t have any expression in it.</p><p><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/teamouse/20-et-Pianoteq-Schantz.mp3?attredirects=0">http://sites.google.com/site/teamouse/20-et-Pianoteq-Schantz.mp3?attredirects=0</a></p><p>Then I loaded the 15-ET version of Beethoven&apos;s Moonlight Sonata (3rd movement) and started playing with some random parameter settings. I started with the Schmidt pianoforte, and kept pressing the Random button until I got something that sounded interesting, then tweaked the parameter settings one by one until I was satisfied with the sound. It has more hammer noise, but less hammer hardness; the impedance is really low, but the Q factor of the soundboard is higher, and the duplex scale is way up. The spectrum profile emphasizes the 5th harmonic but tones down the 2nd, 3rd, and 8th harmonics.</p><p><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/teamouse/mlgt3-15.mp3?attredirects=0">http://sites.google.com/site/teamouse/mlgt3-15.mp3?attredirects=0</a></p></div>
