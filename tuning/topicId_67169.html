But I wanted to contribute a few words about the relation between my orbifolds and traditional tuning lattices.</p><p>1) Take a very simple log-frequency tuning lattice, with acoustically pure fifths on the X axis and octaves on the Y axis: moving one unit to the right raises the pitch by perfect fifth, while moving one unit upward raises the pitch by one octave.<br/>&#x9;Now let&apos;s imagine that the axes are continuous -- if we move fractionally along the positive X axis, we glide slowly upward.  In this continuous version of our tuning lattice, every pitch will now represented by a line: for any distance that we move along the X axis, we can compensate with a move along the Y axis.  Thus points arbitrarily far away in the XY plane can represent the same pitch. Consequently, distance in this space isn&apos;t going to tell you about voice leading.<br/>&#x9;This generalizes to higher dimensions.  It&apos;s typically impossible to embed familiar tuning lattices in continuous spaces where every point represents a *distinct* pitch.  Moreover, &quot;distance&quot; in the resulting spaces measures something other than the distance relevant for thinking about voice leading.<br/>&#x9;(Note, by the way, that if you &quot;glue together&quot; all points representing the same pitch class, you end up with a log-frequency line corresponding to one of the axes.)</p><p>2) However, as someone on this list pointed out, it is possible to represent alternative tunings in my orbifolds.  Basically, any octave repeating scale (including an octave-repeating chromatic or diatonic scale representing a tuning system) gives you a way to measure distance in circular pitch class space.  Musicians typically refer to this unit of distance as a &quot;scale step.&quot;  Only in an equal temperament will all (chromatic) scale steps have the same log-frequency size.</p><p>&#x9;As this happens, my &quot;ChordGeometries&quot; program depicts this nicely.  Start the program, then do the following:<br/>&#x9;a) Select &quot;Master Parameters&quot; from the &quot;Commands&quot; menu.<br/>&#x9;b) Type in some (equal tempered) [sorry!] pitch classes into the &quot;Display These PCs&quot; menu.<br/>&#x9;c) Press &quot;return&quot;<br/>&#x9;d) Select &quot;Dyadic Space&quot; from the &quot;Geometries&quot; menu<br/>&#x9;e) Select &quot;Parameters&quot; from the &quot;Commands&quot; menu<br/>&#x9;f) Use the pop up menu that says &quot;No Lines&quot; to check &quot;Oblique Steps,&quot; &quot;Parallel Steps,&quot; and &quot;Contrary Steps&quot;<br/>&#x9;g) Look at the resulting figure</p><p>What you see represents the metrical grid that a tuning system imposes on the continuous orbifolds.  It sort of looks like the terrain of a hilly city, viewed from above.  It&apos;s worth looking at a bunch of scales (using the &quot;Master Parameters&quot; window) to see how they generate different metrics.</p><p>Hope that helps,<br/>DT<br/>--<br/>WARNING: Princeton Email is currently very unreliable.
