I&apos;d start with<br/>the Helmholtz type idea as the easiest, and because it is all<br/>set up to count beats anyway.</p><p>I&apos;m mainly interested in it from practical point of view as a heuristic<br/>for finding new chords, with the scale already given.</p><p>The Sethares book looks interesting, especially, the suggestion<br/>that the Gamelan scales are linked with the timbres of the gamelan<br/>instruments.</p><p>I&apos;ve also looked at your ideas from time to time, but couldn&apos;t<br/>say I understand enough to be able to program it in yet.<br/>I will be sure to ask you when / if I need to know.</p><p>At present don&apos;t know if this idea of searching for consonant<br/>diads will be a useful way of finding chords,<br/>but it seems quite promising, and if it works, makes sense to list<br/>the main ways of sorting diads according to consonance, so<br/>that one can try them all out and see what happens.</p><p>It&apos;s good at any rate to have some awareness of what<br/>has being done in the field, at this stage.</p><p>I was very interested to hear you say in one of your posts<br/>that if one superimposes notes to make<br/>an otonal chord, using a timbre with inharmonic partials,<br/>then one will hear a sequence of &quot;harmonics&quot; in the<br/>same pitch relationship as a &quot;normal&quot; harmonic series,<br/>with a new short &quot;harmonic series&quot; above each inharmonic partial.</p><p>Your idea seemed quite likely to me that those would remind one<br/>of an instrument timbre with harmonic partials.</p><p>As for your idea that this would make the otonal<br/>chord sound more consonant than the utonal ones,<br/>I&apos;d be interested to listen to them.</p><p>Were there any example clips for this - I&apos;d be<br/>especially interested to listen to them to hear what they<br/>sound like. Maybe other &quot;newbies&quot; would too?</p><p>One could imagine indeed with a sufficiently<br/>strange timbre, and with many notes in the otonal<br/>series, the constructed timbres might overwhelm<br/>the actual ones, so that one would hear kind of<br/>&quot;ghost instruments&quot; in the sound.</p><p>Could be fun to try and create that effect, and<br/>see if it works! Especially if one could do it<br/>with real samples, rather than synthetic timbres.</p><p>I wonder if anyone has done it...</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Paul H.

A<br/>computer-contolled performance should be capable of exploiting this effect<br/>and completely confusing the listener!</p></div>
