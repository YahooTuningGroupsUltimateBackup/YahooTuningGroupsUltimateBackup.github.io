It certainly brings into question the whole subject of<br/>&quot;progression&quot; in alternate tuning, a subject that has been explored in<br/>detail on this list before.  I note, also, that Mr. Lemothe is also<br/>asking questions and commenting on this aspect.</p><p>Curiously, though, it seemed as many of your progressions had more than<br/>only the &quot;penultimate&quot; chord retuned.  For me, many of them seemed to be<br/>entirely in just intonation-type chords.  I only say that since the<br/>&quot;beating&quot; seemed appreciatably reduced in almost all the chords.</p><p>The question is... if these progressions are indeed in just intonation,<br/>than why don&apos;t we have some kind of drift??  Why can we come so<br/>gracefully through the progressions?  Paul, I&apos;m not getting this.</p><p>A few months ago, Joe Monzo did an interesting experiment regarding<br/>&quot;adaptive&quot; just intonation.  I don&apos;t have the URL since I don&apos;t believe<br/>it was ever on his main page. He compared various ratios for just chords<br/>and, also, various &quot;adjustments&quot; to compensate for drift in the<br/>progressions.  It was fascinating.  Also, if you go back through the<br/>archive, you will see the extensive postings by John DeLaubenfels and<br/>Paul Erlich regarding John&apos;s significant work in adaptive just<br/>intonation.</p><p>I dunno.  Given that fact that it seems that listeners are significantly<br/>impacted by their &quot;expectations&quot; it would certainly seem that harmonic<br/>progressions, particularly common ones, would affect peoples&apos;<br/>perceptions of any single chord.  Paul??</p><p>Regarding your interest in the 11th partial:  It was interesting that<br/>the subject of Arabic scales and Zalzal should come up at the same time<br/>as your inquiry concerning the 11th partial!  Either this was<br/>coincidence, or the discussion reminded you of your interest in this...<br/>(??)</p><p>In any case, Joel Mandelbaum has a short discussion about it in his<br/>dissertation.  Most probably you know all of this, but I will quote it<br/>for you anyway:</p><p>Mandelbaum:</p><p>&quot;According to Partch, the Arabian lute-player Zalzal recognized the 11th<br/>partial as an element in his music, and the Renaissance theorist<br/>Vicentino accepted the 11th partial in theory if not in practice.  A<br/>number of writers have cited the 11th partial as the basis for<br/>quarter-tone music (24-tone equal temperament) owing to the close<br/>relationship between the intervals 12:11 (150.6 cents), 11:9 (347.4<br/>cents) and 11:8 (551.3 cents) and the corresponding intervals in 24-tone<br/>temperament (150, 350, and 550 cents respectively).  Partch and Eggen<br/>point out this relationship, but perhaps more significant is the<br/>affirmation of the role of the 11th partial in quarter-tone music by<br/>Ivan Wyschnegradsky, on of the most ardent of the quarter-tonists.  In<br/>his MANUEL D&apos;HARMONIE A QUARTS DE TON, 1933, Wyschnegradsky cites the<br/>11th partial as the best basis for 24-tone temperament...  Lindsay<br/>Norden spectulates that the 11th partial may well be the next to be<br/>brought into the body of music, although he does not consider it to have<br/>been of any importance in the art of harmony up till now...&quot;</p><p>__________ ______ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=11470 href="#11470">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2000 2:02:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Joseph Pehrson &lt;josephpehrson@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; The question is... if these progressions are indeed in just<br/>intonation,<br/>&gt; than why don&apos;t we have some kind of drift??

Paul, I&apos;m not getting this.</p><p>Joseph, although I suspect George is using 31-tET or a similar<br/>meantone temperament, just intonation does not make _every_<br/>progression drift. A progression in JI will drift _if_ all common<br/>tones are observed, _and if_ the progression does not return to the<br/>same point in the just lattice from where it began. I happen to know<br/>that George&apos;s theory does not place too much importance on common<br/>tones, so if faced with a progression that might drift in JI, he<br/>would<br/>probably be inclined to &quot;break&quot; one of the common tones instead of<br/>letting the drift take place.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A few months ago, Joe Monzo did an interesting experiment regarding<br/>&gt; &quot;adaptive&quot; just intonation.

I recall the URL containing &quot;I-IV-<br/>V7-I&quot; in it -- a search through the archives should locate this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I dunno.
