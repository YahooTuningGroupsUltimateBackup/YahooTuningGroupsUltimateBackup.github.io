Are there certain tunings that<br/>suggest themselves for such instruments, either historically or due to the<br/>constraints of the instrument and the player? I suppose one could only<br/>really have a single usable thumbhole, limiting the number of notes - but<br/>I&apos;m not sure, perhaps there are designs I haven&apos;t considered. I&apos;m also not<br/>certain about what hole placements and sizes produce the best sound. Also, I<br/>like techniques like overblowing, tremolo(? I don&apos;t know what wind players<br/>call it), microtonal trills, etc. Are there designs that esp. facilitate<br/>these?

So it is a good one<br/>to use, then - thank you, Chris. Is Mr. Forster on-list?
