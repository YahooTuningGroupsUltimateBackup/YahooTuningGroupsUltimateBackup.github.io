By doing this I was able to play my Fender Mustang, and thus my Roland Gr-20, real time in Carlos Alpha tuning for each melodic instrument. I discovered I was able to record midi and audio though session 3 drummer was finicky and sometimes would not play unless I re-loaded Sonar. Unfortunately I learned about the midi recording while enroute to the piece so I didn&apos;t take real advantage of it - just routed some extra notes to session 3 drummer. So I regret the tone of the guitar - I feel at this moment it doesn&apos;t fit in well with the rest of the timbres. Nontheless since I recorded audio I was able to use audio effects on the guitar, bass, and sax. So consider this a microtonal version of some stupid 70&apos;s heavy funk tune. It does sort of brake down about 1:38 but then so is gravity apparently but I feel ok because I&apos;m fighting entropy in a universe of disorder. *beams*</p><p>I think it was Igs that brought up the difficulty in melodies in Alpha (aka Valentine-ish) - well that difficulty seemed to melt away once I put some proper chords under it. The melodic scale became a sort of octatonic type thing that changed a bit between parts.</p><p>Download here<br/><a href="http://www.notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=824">http://www.notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=824</a></p><p>Online play<br/><a href="http://www.notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=414&start=0">http://www.notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=414&start=0</a></p></div>
