I didn&apos;t want to wait any<br/>longer, and if it were only me I would just walk on by.</p><p>But it wasn&apos;t only me, and so walking was out. Sleeve-rolling-up<br/>time, ladies and gentlemen. Time to make a place that was how it<br/>should be: not just a music-place, but a human-place.</p><p>Along with help from my valued and esteemed colleagues, Margo<br/>Schulter and Jacky Ligon, we have dreamed up a place that embodies<br/>the qualities *we* wanted to see in this kind of community. We&apos;ve set<br/>these qualities out for people to peruse, in a set of guidelines, and<br/>if it feels like home to you, then it probably is. And that will make<br/>us *very* happy.</p><p>All of this, and eventually more, awaits you at the simple address:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic</a></p><p>Creating Microtonal Music: it&apos;s a statement -- it&apos;s an action -- it&apos;s<br/>now a reality. Take a look and see if the panorama looks as good to<br/>you as it did, and does, to us. CMM is a part of the ether that<br/>resonates with the simple mantra:</p><p>      Respect people<br/> Share music and enthusiasm<br/>      Exchange ideas<br/>          Create!</p><p>Looking forward to seeing you there, along with your music!<br/>Jon Szanto<br/>List-Mom: Creating Microtonal Music</p></div>
