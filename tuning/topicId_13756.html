For instance, blue can shade to white (as the sky does on some<br/>days, blue at zenith, shading to white at horizon). You can make<br/>subdivisions, e.g. pale blue, but question still arises, where does pale<br/>blue end. You can define a cut off point at which blue ends and white<br/>begins. However what interests philosophers about this is that if the colour<br/>shades sufficiently gradually, it will be impossible to distinguish by eye<br/>between a shade, and another one that is minutely paler in shade.</p><p>The eye will see shades to either side of the cut off point as identical.<br/>Then you can use an argument called the sorites, or heap, and show that if a<br/>shade is blue, the next one is as well, because it looks identical to the<br/>eye, then the next, until eventually you prove to yourself that white is<br/>blue, and find yourself in a quandry.</p><p>(The actual example most often used in papers is red shading to orange, but<br/>I rather prefer to use blue shading to white because one can actually see<br/>this phenomenon when the weather is right, and have a go at it<br/>experimentally, seeing if one can decide on a definite cut of point for the<br/>colour blue, or not. One can use, say, the twigs of a tree as a marker, and<br/>ask which is the last one to be in front of a blue part of the sky, and<br/>which the first before a white part, and actually carry out the argument,<br/>and baffle oneself a little by it).</p><p>This raises interesting questions about how words have meanings, and vague<br/>predicates have been the subject of numerous philosophical papers.</p><p>However, no-one denies that colour words are meaningful and useful, the<br/>debate is only about why they are, and how it works.</p><p>In the same way, 5-ness could shade gradually into 7-ness, and both words<br/>could have useful meanings.</p><p>Interesting to see what those who feel they can hear a quality of 5-ness or<br/>7-ness in ratios think.</p><p>I&apos;ve done a program that generates successive n-limit (and non n-1 limit)<br/>approximations to any interval.</p><p>Compiled as Win 95/98 32 bit console app.<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/nlimit.exe">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/nlimit.exe</a> [46 K]<br/>c source code:<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/nlimit.c">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/nlimit.c</a></p><p>Examples of use:</p><p>&gt;nlimits 5 7 6<br/>Successive 5-limit and non 3-limit approx. to 7/6<br/>1/1 5/4 6/5 75/64 729/625</p><p>&gt;nlimits 7 11 10<br/>Successive 7-limit and non 5-limit approx. to 11/10<br/>1/1 7/6 8/7 15/14 28/25 35/32 54/49 19683/17920 36015/32768 65536/59535</p><p>Robert Walker</p><p><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/fts_beta/fts_beta_download.htm">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/fts_beta/fts_beta_download.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=13757 href="#13757">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
