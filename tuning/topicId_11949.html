Every interval is<br/>&gt;7-odd-limit consonant except the 21/16, which is so close to 4/3 as to be<br/>&gt;quite dissonant, giving this chord the melancholy sound common to all<br/>&gt;crunchy chords. This is completely lost in 12-eq because the best<br/>&gt;approximation to 21/16 is the perfect fourth. 1/1:9/8:7/6:3/2:7/4 is also<br/>&gt;very crunchy because every interval is 9-odd-limit consonant except the<br/>&gt;28/27, a very narrow interval of 63 cents or a thirdtone. This chord is<br/>&gt;recognizable in 12-eq as min7(9), but just doesn&apos;t have the same bite. I<br/>&gt;think the characteristic sound of these chords stems from the statement of<br/>&gt;two pitches that would be consonant on their own but are not with each<br/>&gt;other, like when two arguments both make sense but are mutually<br/>conflicting.</p><p>Awesome, Keenan. Crunchy chords would be the next category after saturated<br/>chords (see <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/ass.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/ass.htm</a>) in a classification of JI<br/>chords. Read that link and tell me what a crunchy rhubarb would be :)</p><p>&gt;My goal is to find a cruchy chord in which the harmonic entropy of the<br/>&gt;crunchy interval is more than the sum of all the other entropies combined.<br/>&gt;Such a chord would be as crunchy as ice cold raw green pepper, proven to be<br/>&gt;the most crunchy food.</p><p>Unlike the other calculations I&apos;ve been doing, that would depend sensitively<br/>on what order Farey (or whatever) series I use, since the higher the order,<br/>the higher the whole curve.</p></div>
