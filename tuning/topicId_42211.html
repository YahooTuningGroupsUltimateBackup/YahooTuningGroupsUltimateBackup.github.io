If<br/>history is not persuasive enough, you can find the music supports<br/>Werckmeister III.  I have been doing studies of Bach&apos;s use of the opening<br/>melodic interval in his most prominent pieces and the results support the<br/>supposition.  Bach knew about the variations of the 39 melodic intervals of<br/>Werckmeister III.  Perhaps you could get a copy of Igor Kipnis playing Bach&apos;s<br/>Chromatic Fantasy in Werckmeister III.  The aural landmarks are unmistakable.<br/> A comparison with a 12 equal performance is sickly by comparison.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard<br/>(working on the programs for the concert on Saturday)</p></div><h3><a id=42224 href="#42224">ðŸ”—</a>Kyle Gann &#x3C;kgann@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2003 7:01:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Dear All,</p><p>&gt;I was wondering what advancement in technology<br/>&gt;allowed 12 tone ET to become<br/>&gt;possible.

Thanks!</p><p>&gt;M</p><p>Matt,</p><p>This topic is covered in Owen Jorgensen&apos;s mammoth tome Tuning (Michigan University Press), which has a lengthy subtitle that I won&apos;t remember correctly. I probably won&apos;t quite remember the argument correctly either, and don&apos;t have the book at hand to check it. But the gist is, in the 18th century musicians didn&apos;t know enough about acoustics to understand how to tune a stringed keyboard instrument according to the speed of beats in an almost-in-tune interval. They knew the math to figure out the spacing of frets and the length of organ pipes, but couldn&apos;t accurately count the beats caused by two vibrating strings. As the science of acoustics developed in the 19th century thanks to major contributions by Helmholtz and others, it became possible to smooth out the beat rates among intervals along the scale and more closely approach 12-pitch ET. According to Jorgensen, the first &quot;scientific&quot; method for tuning a piano in true 12tet, with charts on how many beats per second each interval in the scale should produce, was published in 1917 by E.B. White. Everything up until then, he contends, had only been approximations, and he gives abundant documentary evidence. I highly recommend the book, written with passion and a high sense of philosophical purpose. Let your teacher slog through Tuning and see if he can rebut it.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Kyle Gann</p></div><h3><a id=42231 href="#42231">ðŸ”—</a>a440a@aol.com</h3><span>2/8/2003 11:36:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>matt writes:</p><p>&lt;&lt; I was wondering what advancement in technology allowed 12 tone ET to<br/>become<br/>possible.

If he did, I am sure he would<br/>have documented HOW he did this.  That is the tricky thing about ET,  it<br/>doens&apos;t depend on decisions of sensual nature, it requires the use of<br/>objective checks, and nobody, but nobody was writing anything down that would<br/>have described the necessary checks and tests for ET before 1830 or so.<br/>   But really, all that aside, if your teacher plays Bach on a WT instrument,<br/>then on an ET instrument, and can&apos;t hear the improvement, then none of the<br/>evidence elsewhere is going to make much difference.<br/>Regards ,<br/>Ed Foote RPT<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/</a><br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html">www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/well_tempered_piano.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=42238 href="#42238">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2003 12:55:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Matt Henry&quot; &lt;yrnehttam@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Dear All,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was wondering what advancement in technology allowed 12 tone ET<br/>to become<br/>&gt; possible.
