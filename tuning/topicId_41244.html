There will also be some<br/>comparisons with 72-EDO and other systems such as paultone tunings.</p><p>Peppermint 24 consists of two 12-note chains in the Wilson/Pepper<br/>temperament based on a ratio of the Golden Section, or Phi (~1.618),<br/>between the larger chromatic semitone and the smaller diatonic<br/>semitone, with fifths at around 704.096 cents, or about 2.141 cents<br/>wide of a pure 2:3. The two chains are placed at a distance equal to<br/>the difference between a regular major second (~208.191 cents) and a<br/>pure 6:7 major third (~266.871 cents), or about 58.680 cents.</p><p>For convenience in the discussion that follows, I&apos;ll give a keyboard<br/>diagram, with an asterisk (*) showing a note on the upper keyboard<br/>raised by the &quot;quasi-diesis&quot; of about 58.680 cents:</p><p>   187.349  346.393              683.253    891.445 1050.488<br/>      C#*      Eb*                   F#*       G#*     Bb*<br/> C*        D*          E*      F*        G*        A*       B*     C*<br/>58.680   266.871    475.062 554.584   762.775   970.967 1179.158 1258.680<br/>           7/6<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>    128.669  287.713              624.574    832.765 991.809<br/>       C#      Eb                    F#         G#     Bb<br/> C         D           E       F          G         A        B     C<br/> 0       208.191    416.382 495.904    704.096   912.287 1120.478 1200</p><p>-----------------<br/>1. Unison vectors<br/>-----------------</p><p>The most notable unison vectors of this tuning system are 896:891,<br/>352:351, and 364:363. More generally, these unison vectors are<br/>characteristic of tempered systems with fifths around 704 cents and<br/>regular thirds near 11:14 and 11:13 or 28:33.</p><p>The 896:891 (~9.688 cents), or &quot;3-11 kleisma&quot; as I call it, marks the<br/>difference between a pure 11:14 major third (~417.508 cents) and a<br/>Pythagorean 64:81 major third (~407.820 cents) formed from four pure<br/>fifths. In Peppermint 24, each fifth is tempered wide by about 1/4 of<br/>this kleisma -- actually a bit less, to produce major thirds at about<br/>416.382 cents, or around 1.126 cents narrow of 11:14.</p><p>The 352:351 (~4.925 cents), or &quot;3-13 kleisma,&quot; is the difference<br/>between a pure 11:13 minor third (~289.210 cents) and a Pythagorean<br/>minor third at 27:32 (~294.135) formed by three pure fifths. In<br/>Peppermint 24, fifths are tempered by slightly more than 1/3 of this<br/>kleisma, producing minor thirds at about 287.713 cents, around 1.497<br/>cents narrow of 11:13.</p><p>The 364:363 (~4.763 cents), or &quot;11-13 schisma,&quot; could be defined as<br/>the amount by which 11:14 plus 11:13 would exceed a pure 2:3 fifth --<br/>or the difference between 11:13 and 28:33 (~284.447 cents), the<br/>fifth&apos;s complement of 11:14. Likewise, 364:363 is the difference<br/>between major thirds at 11:14 and 26:33 (~412.745 cents), the latter<br/>ratio constituting the fifth&apos;s complement of 11:13.</p><p>In musical terms, having 896:891 and 352:351 as unison vectors in<br/>Peppermint 24 means that four fifths up are equivalent to 11:14, and<br/>three fifths down to 11:13.</p><p>Further, having 364:363 as a unison vector means that the same<br/>interval of 416.382 cents represents either 11:14 (~1.126 cents<br/>narrow) or 26:33 (~3.637 cents wide). Likewise, the interval of<br/>287.713 cents represents either 11:13 (~1.497 cents narroww) or 28:33<br/>(~3.266 cents wide).</p><p>Interestingly, 72-EDO provides an example of a system where some of<br/>these rather small ratios, but not all, are treated as unison<br/>vectors. Thus 896:891 is observed, and indeed magnified from 9.688<br/>cents to 16-2/3 cents (~64:81 at 400 cents, ~11:14 at 416-2/3 cents),<br/>while 352:351 is similarly magnified from 4.925 cents to 16-2/3 cents<br/>(~27:32 at 300 cents, ~11:13 at 283-1/3 cents).</p><p>However, in 72-EDO, 364:363 is treated as a unison vector: the same<br/>interval of 283-1/3 cents represents either 28:33 or 11:13, while<br/>416-2/3 cents represents either 11:14 or 26:33.</p><p>Returning to Peppermint 24, we can find some other unison vectors<br/>involving a range of intervals. Here I give a few examples I&apos;ve<br/>noticed.</p><p>The diminished fourth (e.g. F#4-Bb4, with C4 as middle C) at about<br/>367.235 cents can represent either 17:21 (~365.825 cents), in respect<br/>to which it is about 1.410 cents wide, or 21:26 (~369.747 cents), to<br/>which it is about 2.512 cents narrow. Here the unison vector is<br/>442:441 (~3.921 cents), the difference between these just ratios.<br/>Either ratio, or the Peppermint 24 interval used for both, could be<br/>described as a submajor third or large neutral or semi-neutral third.</p><p>Moving to the central region of neutral thirds, we find that the<br/>single interval of about 346.393 cents, a minor third plus<br/>quasi-diesis (e.g. C4-Eb*4), serves either as a very accurate<br/>representation of 9:11 (~347.408 cents), narrow by around 1.015 cents;<br/>or a rather less accurate representation of 32:39 (~342.483 cents),<br/>wide by around 3.910 cents. Here the unison vector, equal to the<br/>difference between 9:11 and the smaller 32:39, is the 352:351 we have<br/>already encountered with regular minor thirds (11:13 vis-a-vis 27:32).</p><p>A more &quot;esoteric&quot; interval in Peppermint 24 is the major third formed<br/>by diminished fourth plus quasi-diesis (e.g. B4-Eb*5), about 425.915<br/>cents. This interval can represent either 18:23 (~424.364 cents), to<br/>which it is about 1.550 cents wide; or 25:32 (~427.373 cents), to<br/>which it is about 1.458 cents narrow. Here the unison vector is<br/>576:575 (~3.008 cents). This Peppermint 24 interval could also be<br/>taken as a tribute to 17-EDO, with its colorful major third of about<br/>423.529 cents.</p><p>We encounter the same unison vector of 576:575 in relation to the<br/>tempered fifth&apos;s counterpart of this Peppermint 24 interval, the<br/>augmented second plus diesis (e.g. Eb*5-F#5) at around 278.181 cents.<br/>This interval is honored as a Monzian third, since it is very close to<br/>the 279-cent size which Joe &quot;Monz&quot; Monzo chose in an Aristoxenian<br/>fashion through trial by ear for one of his pieces; and could also be<br/>honored as a Secorian third, since it is almost identical to the minor<br/>third of around 278.115 cents found in the nearer keys of George<br/>Secor&apos;s superb 17-note well-temperament (17-WT).</p><p>The Peppermint 24 third at ~278.181 cents is about 0.590 cents wide of<br/>a pure 23:27 (~277.591 cents), and about 3.598 cents wide of a pure<br/>64:75 (~274.582 cents), the just ratio which Monz selected as the best<br/>equivalent for his empirical choice of 279 cents.</p><p>-----------------------<br/>2. Some observed ratios<br/>-----------------------</p><p>In Peppermint 24, the quasi-diesis of ~58.680 cents (e.g. F4-F*4)<br/>represents two very important observed ratios: 28:27 and 33:32.</p><p>The 28:27 (~62.961 cents), or septimal thirdtone much favored by<br/>Archytas, defines the difference for example between a 7:9 major third<br/>(~435.084 cents) and a 3:4 fourth (~498.045 cents). In Peppermint 24,<br/>the quasi-diesis is about 4.282 cents narrow of this ratio, and often<br/>represents it in cadential progressions where a tempered 14:18:21:24<br/>sonority, for example, expands to an approximate 2:3:4, here with the<br/>thirdtone steps of F4-F*4 and C4-C*4:</p><p>            F4     F*4<br/>            D*4    C*4<br/>            C4     C*4<br/>            G*3    F*3</p><p>The quasi-diesis also represents the undecimal diesis of 33:32<br/>(~53.273 cents), the difference between 3:4 and 8:11 (~551.318<br/>cents). Thus a fourth plus quasi-diesis (e.g. C4-F*4) yields the best<br/>approximation of 8:11 at ~554.584 cents (~3.266 cents wide).</p><p>The difference of a regular diatonic semitone (e.g. E4-F4) at ~79.522<br/>cents less this quasi-diesis (E4-E*4) yields a commatic interval of<br/>~20.842 cents (E*4-F4).</p><p>From one viewpoint, this interval represents the commatic vector of<br/>64:63, aptly named by George Secor as the comma of Archytas, marking<br/>the difference between the Pythagorean 64:81 and 7:9, or the<br/>Pythagorean 27:32 and 6:7. In Peppermint 24, this would be the<br/>difference between a regular major third (e.g. C*4-E*4) and a near-7:9<br/>major third at around 437.225 cents (e.g. C*4-F4, ~2.141 cents wide);<br/>or a regular minor third (e.g. C4-Eb4) and a just 6:7 minor third<br/>(e.g. C4-D*4).</p><p>From another viewpoint, this same commatic vector could be taken to<br/>represent 99:98 (~17.576 cents), the difference between 11:14 and 7:9,<br/>or 28:33 and 6:7.</p><p>Interestingly, the difference between the 28:27 thirdtone and the<br/>33:32 undecimal diesis is the unison vector of 896:891 -- as is the<br/>difference between 64:63 and 99:98.</p><p>Another and slightly smaller type of diesic vector observed in<br/>Peppermint 24 does not itself occur directly as a step: the 34:33<br/>(~51.682 cents), marking the difference between a 28:33 minor third<br/>and a 14:17 subminor or small neutral or semi-neutral third (~336.130<br/>cents), or between an 11:14 major third and a 17:21 submajor third.<br/>In a larger tuning set such as Peppermint 34, with two 17-note chains,<br/>this vector would be represented by the natural diesis, e.g. Ab4-G#4<br/>(e.g. F4-Ab4 vs F3-G#4, or Ab4-C5 vs. G#4-C5), about 49.147 cents).</p><p>We might describe as a &quot;chromatic vector&quot; the usual chromatic semitone<br/>(e.g. C4-C#4) at ~128.669 cents, only about 0.371 cents wider than a<br/>pure 13:14 (~128.298 cents).</p><p>A range of smaller distinctions are observed. For example, we have<br/>distinct representations both for 23:27 (a tempered 278.181 cents) and<br/>6:7 (pure), observing the vector of 262:261 (~10.720 cents). Likewise<br/>the distinctions within 11:12:13:14 are all observed, with vectors<br/>such as 169:168 (~10.274 cents), or 12:13 less 13:14.</p><p>A curious vector observed in Peppermint 24 is the difference between<br/>12:17 (~603.000 cents) and 17:24 (597.000 cents), or 289:288 (~6.001<br/>cents). These ratios are represented in tempered form by the augmented<br/>third plus quasi-diesis (e.g. Eb4-G#*4) at ~603.731 cents, and the<br/>diminished fifth less quasi-diesis (e.g. G#*4-Eb5) at ~596.269 cents,<br/>respectively wide of 12:17 and narrow of 17:24 by around 0.731 cents.</p><p>While the near-12:17 is a rare interval, occurring in only one<br/>location, it is very useful, for example, in an approximation of the<br/>isoharmonic sonority 7:12:17 with differences of 5: the 7:12 is just,<br/>with 12:17 and 7:17 (14:17 plus an octave) wide by only ~0.731 cents.</p><p>Notably, 289:288 is one of the unison vectors found in 22-EDO, or<br/>indeed in any paultone tuning, where a demioctave of precisely 600<br/>cents provides the best representation of 12:17 and 17:24 alike -- as<br/>also, most characteristically, of both 5:7 (~582.512 cents) and 7:10<br/>(~617.488 cents), the 50:49 commonly cited as one of the defining<br/>unison vectors for such a tuning.</p><p>-------------------------------------<br/>3. Vectors predictable and fortuitous<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>One topic of xenharmonic discussions is how some unison vectors or<br/>observed vectors are by design, while others arise more or less<br/>fortuitously. While George Secor&apos;s 17-WT, the topic for two articles<br/>in the forthcoming Xenharmonikon 18 (one by the designer himself),<br/>amply illustrates the first kind of process as well as the second here<br/>and there, Peppermint 24 might be taken largely as an example of happy<br/>serendipity.</p><p>To what extent did Ervin Wilson consider the musical characteristics<br/>of the regular tuning with a ratio between chromatic and diatonic<br/>semitones equal to Phi that appears on the Scale Tree? In proposing<br/>the same regular temperament as a counterpart of Kornerup&apos;s Golden<br/>Meantone (where the same ratio obtains between the large diatonic and<br/>small chromatic semitone), Keenan Pepper was evidently proceeding by<br/>way of an appealing mathematical intuition rather than a calculated<br/>optimization for a given musical style.</p><p>As it happens, however, the basic Wilson/Pepper temperament gets the<br/>ratios of 11:14, 11:13, 14:17, and 17:21 -- and also 13:14 -- all<br/>within 1.5 cents of just. Thus it _could have_ been proposed as a<br/>deliberate optimization of these intervals, with predictable unison<br/>vectors (e.g. 896:891, 352:351, 364:363) and observed vectors<br/>(e.g. 34:33, 14:13).</p><p>When I got the idea for Peppermint 24, the main intent was to add<br/>accurate ratios of 2-3-7-9, so that the system would have near-just<br/>versions of both 11:14 and 7:9, or 11:13 and 6:7, naturally implying a<br/>thirdtone vector of 27:28 and a commatic vector of 63:64 (or 98:99,<br/>from the viewpoint of 11:14 and 7:9, or 28:33 and 6:7).</p><p>As it happens, choosing a quasi-diesis between the two 12-note chains<br/>so as to obtain pure 6:7 thirds also produces a range of other<br/>intervals within about 3.266 cents of just -- 11:12, 9:11, 8:11, for<br/>example, and also 12:17, 18:23 and 23:27, and 23:31.</p><p>The most obvious weakness of the system is the tempering of fifths and<br/>fourths by a full 2.14 cents, meaning that 8:9 is wide by twice this<br/>amount, or about 4.282 cents. A proper &quot;near-just&quot; system, in<br/>comparison, should do somewhat better than 12n-EDO (fifths ~1.955<br/>cents narrow, 8:9 ~3.910 cents narrow).</p><p>A final point might not be out of place here: often convenient unison<br/>vectors, rather than accuracy, can serve as a major attraction for a<br/>given tuning in a given stylistic context.</p><p>For example, while the representation of 11:14 in Peppermint 24 at<br/>~416.382 cents is quite accurate (~1.126 cents narrow), 72-EDO is<br/>actually closer to just at 416-2/3 cents (~0.841 cents narrow).</p><p>However, in Peppermint 24, the unison vector of 896:891 permits<br/>the equivalence of a regular major third (e.g. C4-E4) to 11:14.<br/>In 72-EDO, in comparison, the best representation of 11:14 calls for<br/>an inflection of the regular 400-cent major third by 1/12-tone,<br/>observing and (as noted) actually magnifying the size of this kleismic<br/>vector.</p><p>Similarly, for music where 4:5 is the preferred major third, meantone<br/>has the advantage over 72-EDO not so much of accuracy (4:5 is just in<br/>1/4-comma, but 2:3 and 5:6 alike notably less accurate) as of the<br/>convenience of having the 80:81 unison vector, the syntonic comma or<br/>comma of Didymus (~21.586 cents) in just intonation. In 72-EDO the<br/>80:81 (e.g. ~4:5 at 383-1/3 cents vs. ~64:81 at 400 cents), like the<br/>891:896, is represented by a 1/12-tone step of 16-2/3 cents.</p><p>At the same time, Peppermint 24 shares with 36-EDO or 72-EDO a<br/>commatic vector of 64:63; the usual major or minor third is distinct<br/>from the best (and quite accurate) representation of 7:9 or 6:7.<br/>Further, we note that 72-EDO is more specific regarding 33:32 and<br/>28:27, with these intervals realized respectively as a quartertone (50<br/>cents) and a thirdtone (66-2/3 cents). In contrast, Peppermint 24<br/>relies on the 58.68-cent quasi-diesis to represent both ratios<br/>somewhat less accurately.</p><p>Looking at the unison vectors and observed vectors in a tuning system,<br/>or comparing systems, might at once help to identify musical patterns<br/>in use or to suggest new patterns for stylistic exploration; I share<br/>these reflections from both points of view.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=41246 href="#41246">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2002 5:42:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

The<br/>difference is 46, making me realize that the 46-comma is involved in<br/>the 704.2-cent region as the difference between the 12-diesis (12<br/>fifths up) and the 34-diesis (34 fifths down).</p><p>This is a bit analogous to the situation with Pythagorean, where the<br/>12-comma or Pythagorean comma (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents) plus the<br/>comma of Mercator (53 pure fifths less 31 octaves, ~3.62 cents) is<br/>almost identical to the comma of Archytas or 64:63 (~27.26 cents)<br/>which George Secor has aptly named. Thus 68 fourths less the requisite<br/>number of octaves is almost exactly equal to 6:7, or 68 fifths to 7:12.</p><p>We could break this down as (3 + 12 + 53) fifths forming a usual<br/>Pythagorean major sixth at 16:27 (~905.87 cents) plus a Pythagorean<br/>comma plus a comma of Mercator, together only a nanisma (~0.189 cents)<br/>short of a pure 7:12.</p><p>This means that having two chains of Pythagorean fifths at 68 pure<br/>fourths apart is almost identical to two such chains at a pure 6:7<br/>apart; and two such chains at 65 pure fifths apart (a 12-comma plus a<br/>53-comma) would be almost identical to having the chains a pure 64:63<br/>apart.</p><p>We might call such arrangements &quot;linear noncontiguous systems&quot;: a<br/>single generator can serve as the source of all the notes in the<br/>tuning, but we have two chains of a given size that are not<br/>contiguous. They are separated by a distance of 65 fifths or 68<br/>fourths for the Pythagorean example with pure 2-3-7-9 intervals, or by<br/>34 fourths for the 704.160-cent temperament with pure 6:7 minor<br/>thirds.</p><p>Here&apos;s the 704.160-cent scheme I describe in Scala format:</p><p>! lin76-34.scl<br/>!<br/>Two 12-note chains, ~704.160 cents, 34 4ths apart (32 4ths = 7:6)<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 58.55034<br/> 129.12199<br/> 187.67233<br/> 208.32057<br/> 266.87091<br/> 287.51915<br/> 346.06949<br/> 416.64114<br/> 475.19148<br/> 495.83972<br/> 554.39006<br/> 624.96171<br/> 683.51205<br/> 704.16029<br/> 762.71062<br/> 833.28228<br/> 891.83261<br/> 912.48086<br/> 971.03119<br/> 991.67943<br/> 1050.22977<br/> 1120.80142<br/> 1179.35176<br/> 2/1</p><p>In this scheme, the representations of 2-3-7-9-11-13 and 14:17:21 are<br/>much as in Peppermint 24, where an arbitrary &quot;quasi-diesis&quot; of ~58.680<br/>cents is used to achieve a pure 7:6.</p><p>Note, however, that from your 17-limit perspective, there&apos;s an<br/>important disadvantage in this approach: the noncontiguous chains<br/>don&apos;t include the excellent approximation of 4:5 as 21 fifths up<br/>(augmented second plus natural 12-diesis).</p><p>From my own point of view, I might prefer Peppermint 24, because it&apos;s<br/>minutely more accurate for fifths and fourths (~2.141 cents vs. ~2.205<br/>cents wide for fifths and narrow for fourths), with the temperament of<br/>these intervals, and of 8:9 and 9:16 by twice as much, as the main<br/>compromise from a &quot;near-just&quot; perspective. While Peppermint is also<br/>more accurate for the almost pure 12:13 and 13:14, the 704.160-cent<br/>system is more accurate for 11:12 and 8:11.</p><p>From my practical perspective as a keyboardist, either scheme would<br/>have much the same &quot;look and feel,&quot; producing an arrangement I call<br/>&quot;metachromatic,&quot; with the distance between the keyboards representing<br/>a step of 28:27 (and also 33:32). Thus 6:7 is &quot;major second plus<br/>diesis,&quot; and 7:9 &quot;fourth less diesis,&quot; etc. -- here actually the<br/>&quot;quasi-diesis&quot; of Peppermint, or the 34-diesis of the 704.160-cent<br/>scheme.</p><p>The main advantage of a regular and contiguous temperament such as the<br/>e-based tuning (Blackwood&apos;s R=e) is that we have free transposibility<br/>over the range of the gamut; in other words, G#-Eb*=G#-D#, a usual<br/>fifth. In Peppermint 24, that same interval is about 11.673 cents wide<br/>of 2:3, or in the 704.160-cent temperament scheme, about 10.832 cents<br/>wide.</p><p>However, in these noncontiguous schemes, the fifths are more<br/>moderately tempered, with 6:7 pure, to keep all intervals of<br/>12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 within 2.141 or 2.205 cents of pure. Also,<br/>ratios of 11:12:13:14 are overall more accurately represented. Each<br/>scheme has its own charms.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=41282 href="#41282">ðŸ”—</a>Gene W Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2002 11:57:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

In your linear<br/>temperament at ~704.16, this same relationship gives a near-pure<br/>rendition for the 5 limit.</p><p>For the e-based temperament at ~704.61 cents, or your RMS optimization<br/>at around 704.56 or whatever, the 46-comma is a similar size, but in<br/>the opposite direction (46-EDO is something like 704.35 cents). As you<br/>have pointed it, here -25 fifths or 25 fourths give a better 5-limit<br/>approximation that 21 fifths up -- for the e-based temperament,<br/>something like 384.75 cents (this was using 704.61 as a rough<br/>approximation of the generator). That&apos;s a bit closer to just than a<br/>Pythagorean schisma third at 8192:6561 (~384.36 cents).</p><p>While I noticed the near-pure 4:5 in the 24-note linear version of<br/>Wilson/Pepper when I looked at in October of 2000, the -25<br/>relationship in the e-based temperament is something that hadn&apos;t<br/>occurred to me, since it doesn&apos;t arise in a 24-note tuning. However,<br/>in applications where one has a larger tuning set, and especially<br/>where an accurate 5-limit representation is a priority, that -25 could<br/>be a defining parameter of the tuning.</p><p>From my own viewpoint, the defining feature of e-based is the use of<br/>-13 14 15 for 7:9, 6:7, and 4:7 -- but from a 5-limit viewpoint, the<br/>availability of -25 for 4:5 could be at least as important.</p><p>This dialogue might also illustrate the role that assumptions can play<br/>regarding the likely size of a tuning for a given purpose.</p><p>Thus Dave Keenan, in his germinal articles on chain-of-fifths tunings,<br/>assumes that the longest chain to be considered for his purposes is<br/>generally 14 fifths, with an exception for tunings with multiple<br/>chains of fifths separated by distances like 600 cents.</p><p>Often I tend to take 24 as a likely tuning size, so that anything up<br/>to about 16 fifths gets viewed as &quot;usual.&quot; For example, in a 24-note<br/>Pythagorean tuning, we have intervals of 2-3-7-9 realized as chains of<br/>-14 -15 16 for 4:7, 6:7, and 7:9. This means that there are as many<br/>7-based minor sevenths (10), minor thirds (9), and major thirds (8) as<br/>their regular Pythagorean counterparts, a satisfactory situation from<br/>my point of view.</p><p>However, as your linear temperaments show, being ready to consider<br/>longer chains and larger tuning sets opens up room for all kinds of<br/>optimizations that might not occur applying constraints like those<br/>Dave and I might assume (often implicitly) for smaller tuning sets.</p><p>Humorously, some of us might recall that Keenan Pepper himself was rather<br/>dissatisfied with his 704.096-cent temperament because it didn&apos;t have any<br/>close approximations of 4:5 or 4:7, two intervals he regarded as<br/>indispensable for his generally preferred harmonic style.  However, it<br/>turns it that 21 fifths up is a virtually pure 4:5, while 31 fifths down<br/>(as you point out for your optimization with slightly wider fifths) is<br/>quite close to 4:7, about 973.024 cents, or ~4.20 cents wide.</p><p>Of course, my immediate enthusiasm for Wilson/Pepper as a 12-note<br/>tuning _does_ reflect a rather different musical agenda -- but your<br/>remarks are a good reminder that in addition to timbre and style,<br/>tuning size can be a significant variable in judging the possible<br/>qualities of a given temperament.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=41306 href="#41306">ðŸ”—</a>M.

What I&apos;d like to do is to clarify how I use these<br/>tunings, while at the same time noting an interesting point raised by<br/>your examples taken from the spectrum between 29-EDO and 17-EDO.</p><p>First of all, from your 5-limit point of view (as part of your<br/>17-limit point of view), you note that some of these tunings have a<br/>best value for 4:5 (~386.31 cents) of either 21 or -25 (21 fifths up<br/>or 25 fifths down).</p><p>The 21 fifths up, as in Wilson/Pepper (~704.096 cents) or 121-EDO<br/>(very close to it, and one of the choices you list), could be analyzed<br/>as 4 + 17 -- that is, is a regular major third (near 11:14, ~417.51<br/>cents, in this region) less a 17-comma, which is here in effect<br/>equivalent to an 81:80 -- or a 56:55, if we take the comparison as<br/>11:14 vis-a-vis 4:5. Note that in Wilson/Pepper, for example, we have<br/>a regular major third at about 416.38 cents, and a 21-fifths major<br/>third around 386.01 cents -- a difference of ~30.37 cents, quite close<br/>to 56:55 (~31.19 cents).</p><p>The 25 fifths down or fourths up which we find to be optimal for<br/>5-limit with slightly larger fifths could be taken as -8 + -17, or a<br/>diminished fourth (rather close to 17:21, ~365.83 cents, in this<br/>region) plus a 17-comma. Here we might say that the comma represents<br/>85:84, the difference between 17:21 and 4:5. This approximation would<br/>hold on the other side of 46-EDO, as with your 704.56-cent<br/>optimization, which yields a -25 major third almost identical in size<br/>to the 21 major third of Pepper/Wilson.</p><p>An interesting feature of 29-EDO (~703.45 cents), by the way, is that<br/>we might say that 85:84 is a unison vector. Thus people might regard<br/>the interval of 8/29 octave (~331.03 cents) as either a small<br/>supraminor third not too far from 14:17 (~336.13 cents), or as a large<br/>and not-so-accurate representation of 5:6 (~315.64 cents). While I<br/>take the former approach, you might well take the latter. The point is<br/>that one interval in 29-EDO can represent both ratios. In contrast, in<br/>the around around Pepper/Wilson or the e-based temperament (~704.61<br/>cents), the two ratios have separate representations, so that 85:84 is<br/>observed.</p><p>Now for the question of how I actually use tunings in this general<br/>region between 29-EDO and 17-EDO and go about optimizing, an area<br/>where our approaches might be quite distinct.</p><p>Generally I&apos;m interested in the following considerations:</p><p>         (1) Regular thirds (4, -3) near 11:14 and 11:13 or 28:33;</p><p>         (2) Supraminor/submajor thirds (9, -8) near 14:17 and 17:21;</p><p>         (3) 2-3-7-9 intervals in 14:18:21:24 or 12:14:18:21; and</p><p>         (4) Approximate steps of 11:12:13:14.</p><p>Note that in this region, the usual mapping and keyboard notation of<br/>the 7-based intervals could be written like this:</p><p>          6:7 = 2*       7:9 = -1d     4:7 =  3*<br/>         7:12 = 3d      9:14 =  1*     7:8 = -3d</p><p>Here &quot;*&quot; shows the indicated number of fifths up or down plus a diesis<br/>or quasi-diesis separating the two keyboards; &quot;d&quot; likely shows the<br/>indicated chain less a diesis or quasi-diesis. For example, 6:7 is<br/>represented as a major second (2) plus a diesis or quasi-diesis.</p><p>In the e-based tuning or a tuning in that region, the natural diesis<br/>is the interval between the keyboards, so that we might write *=12.<br/>This means 6:7=14, 7:9=-13, and 4:7=15.</p><p>For Peppermint and other 24-note systems optimized for 2-3-7-9 which,<br/>in contrast to the e-based tuning, do not use a single 24-note chain,<br/>my approach is to define 2*=6:7 so that 6:7 is just; thus the<br/>quasi-diesis is equal to (6:7 - 2), or a pure 6:7 less a major<br/>second. This is about 58.680 cents for Peppermint 24.</p><p>Another way of defining this quasi-diesis is to say that it is equal<br/>to a just 27:28 (~62.96 cents) less twice the tempering of the fifth<br/>in the wide direction.</p><p>Thus my approach focuses on defining a distance between the chains so<br/>as to optimize 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24; each chain provides<br/>optimized versions of the regular thirds (~22:28:33 or ~22:26:33, the<br/>former for most of the region and the latter near 29-EDO at the lower<br/>end), and of supraminor/subminor thirds. The latter might be said to<br/>range from something like 52:63:78 near 29-EDO to 14:17:21 in the<br/>Peppermint region to something like 46:56:69 (23:28 and 56:59) in the<br/>e-based region.</p><p>Note that 5-based thirds are tangential in this kind of musical style,<br/>with the optimization determined by other factors. In either<br/>Peppermint 24 or the e-based tuning, we get some 9* thirds (augmented<br/>second plus diesis or quasi-diesis) at around 395.540 or 396.745<br/>cents, maybe something like 1/8-comma meantone, and a bit smaller than<br/>in 12-EDO. This is fine -- they add another somewhat exotic &quot;flavor&quot;<br/>at a few positions, thus increasing the diversity of the tuning, but<br/>the optimization focuses on the regular intervals in each chain plus<br/>2-3-7-9.</p><p>What I would emphasize is that these are only my musical priorities;<br/>your 17-limit method is a very logical approach for the kind of<br/>optimization you are seeking, and your 704.16-cent optimization with a<br/>long enough chain of fifths, or one of your other temperaments, looks<br/>like an ideal solution.</p><p>Of course, your conclusions are of interest from any viewpoint,<br/>because they show a bit more about the structure of these tunings,<br/>including the vectors that we&apos;re discussing in this thread.</p><p>One conclusion is that in using the larger tuning sets your 17-limit<br/>optimizations might imply, one should take note that in the area right<br/>around 704 cents, the 17-comma is just the right size to serve as a<br/>kind of 81:80 or 56:55 (11:14 vis-a-vis 4:5), but a bit large to serve<br/>as an ideal 99:98 (11:14 vis-a-vis 7:9, or 28:33 vis-a-vis 6:7). To<br/>put the point another way, the 12-diesis (close to 50 cents) is quite<br/>small for a 27:28, and we want a larger quasi-diesis.</p><p>If we go to the area close to but a bit past 46-EDO, however, then the<br/>17-comma makes a good 56:55 (e.g. 4 vis-a-vis -13 for 11:14 and 7:9 in<br/>the e-based tuning or your 704.56-cent optimization, or 109-EDO), but<br/>is rather large to add to a supraminor third (9* or 21) if the idea is to<br/>get a really accurate 4:5. Here a submajor third plus a 17-comma would<br/>be more accurate -- as in your 704.56-cent temperament, where -25<br/>yields a virtually just 4:5.</p><p>The implication is that to get optimal results for something like<br/>4:5:6:7, you&apos;d want a tuning set large enough to observe these<br/>differences and choose the best approximation for each interval.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=41308 href="#41308">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2002 11:08:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
