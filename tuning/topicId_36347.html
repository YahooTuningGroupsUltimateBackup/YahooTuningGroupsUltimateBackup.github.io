Thai music is based on pentatonic melodies<br/>that are typically transposed to three or four different keys in the<br/>course of a composition. the typical Thai pentatonic scales can be<br/>expressed in cents as</p><p>0  343  514  686  1029  (1200)</p><p>0  171  514  686  1029  (1200)</p><p>0  171  343  686   857  (1200)</p><p>Daniel Wolf has reported that vocalists and players of flexible-pitch<br/>instruments in Thailand tend to shade these intervals toward meantone<br/>tuning which distinguishes major and minor thirds (unlike 7-equal);<br/>the &apos;target&apos; scales of such an operation would resemble:</p><p>0  310  503  697  1006  (1200)</p><p>0  194  503  697  1006  (1200)</p><p>0  194  387  697   890  (1200),</p><p>respectively. however, nearby in Bali one finds the most common<br/>pentatonic scales bent in the *opposite* direction relative to 7-<br/>equal -- such as, just as examples,</p><p>0  365  522  678  1043  (1200)</p><p>0  157  522  678  1043  (1200)</p><p>0  157  313  678   834  (1200)</p><p>which come from the &apos;pelog&apos; tuning system, while &apos;slendro&apos;,<br/>resembling a 5-tone equal temperament scale, stands beside pelog in<br/>importance in many Indonesian cultures as well . . . .</p></div>
