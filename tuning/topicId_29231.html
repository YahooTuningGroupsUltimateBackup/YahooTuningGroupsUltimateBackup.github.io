Currently, I don&apos;t allow for user-specified grounding, but<br/>it certainly could be done!  A given pentatonic MIDI sequence would,<br/>of course, tend to find some sort of &quot;natural&quot; grounding, but it&apos;d<br/>probably look a lot like the COFT I did, with 1/4-comma meantone across<br/>notes C, D, and E (but not G and A).</p><p>Interesting thought!
