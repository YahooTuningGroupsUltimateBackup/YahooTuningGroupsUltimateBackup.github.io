If I re-do the search using 2 cents, I don&apos;t get it at all--it&apos;s dropped right off the chart. Except it hasn&apos;t: it&apos;s merely changed it&apos;s name to 7&amp;65. This is disconcerting to say the least.</p><p>It&apos;s still there, #3, at 0.5 cents, which is a relief. The commas for this temperament, in case anyone cares, are 243/242 and 4000/3993.</p></div>
