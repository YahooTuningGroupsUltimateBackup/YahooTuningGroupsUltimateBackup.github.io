IOW, use the interval class names of 31-tET, which (IMVHO) is about as fine-grained of a differentiation as can audibly be perceived.  But rather than defining them according to specific intervals, I&apos;ve opted to give *approximate* ranges for them, based on 36 &amp; 48-EDO (since they are related to 12-tET, and thus are simple fractions of the semitone...though I&apos;m considering basing it on 48 &amp; 72 to improve the accuracy a bit).

As for the &quot;major&quot; vs. &quot;perfect&quot;, all I can say is that it&apos;s diatonic convention.  I have to assume my readers know at least the basic diatonic interval classes, or else I&apos;d have to explain waaaaaay more than I&apos;m up for.  My guess is that the fifth and fourth are called &quot;perfect&quot; because, historically, these intervals have the highest priority.  Major thirds and minor thirds seem to be treated as equally consonant, but a perfect fifth is treated as much more consonant than a diminished fifth.  Oddly, though, the idea of having major and minor tritones seems totally sensible to me.</p><p>&gt;    The other tricky point: saying when one class starts and another ends.  If I<br/>&gt; were you I would try to decided it by ear rather than math based on<br/>&gt; feel...possibly even labeling areas with moods not leaning at all toward<br/>&gt; neighboring classes as &quot;gray areas&quot;.

But the way I intend to present it is that interval classes are by nature &quot;fuzzy&quot;, and there&apos;s no sharp boundary between them.  An interval like 450 cents is right between a fourth and a supermajor third, and depending on how you use it, it can sound like either.  So I want to make sure that my readers know that the boundaries are indistinct, and a clever composition can actually make good use of these ambiguities to make you hear the same interval as first one class, then another class.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=91674 href="#91674">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2010 1:22:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I would say that this naming terminology is on the whole really good,<br/>although the use of &quot;augmented&quot; and &quot;diminished&quot; to reflect<br/>quarter-tone shifted intervals will likely cause some confusion.

Of course the familiar terminology is going to seem warped a little bit.  But you are right, it does need to be addressed to avoid confusion.  Thank you for pointing that out.  I intend to get around this by explaining that in most EDOs, interval classes collapse in to each other, so even though you call 100 cents an &quot;augmented unison&quot; in 12-tET, that&apos;s only because the minor second and the augmented unison are both collapsed to 100 cents in 12-tET.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=91677 href="#91677">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2010 8:56:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs&gt;&quot;I intend to get around this by explaining that in most EDOs, interval<br/>classes collapse in to each other&quot;</p><p>   On that note (and another reason for people to get excited about<br/>micro-tonality...there are a lot of intervals in 12TET that don&apos;t collapse very<br/>well to anything nearby...</p><p>   In 12TET...<br/>1) The major third is about 13 cents off 5/4<br/>2) The tri-tone is about 17 cents from 10/7 and about the same distance from 7/5<br/>(easily into a &quot;fuzzy&quot; range).<br/>3) The minor third is about 16 cents off 6/5<br/>4) The major 6th is about 16 cents from 5/3<br/>5) The major 7th is about 12 cents from 15/8<br/>...and, since 12TET is an ET tuning...these problem intervals/dyads pop up<br/>relative to every single one of the 12 possible root tones!</p><p>   Now considering most of these pop up as dyads in the diatonic scale under<br/>12TET...it&apos;s no wonder common practice theory in 12TET seems to involve so much<br/>detail just to figure out which chords make good points resolution.  Even a<br/>quick comparison of 31TET to 12TET intervals should make it obvious to people<br/>that it is not too difficult to improve the current system.</p><p>   I think perhaps a huge part of the primer is saying flat out that there are a<br/>lot of issues with 12TET. ...And that this makes micro-tonality very useful even<br/>for those who like standard chords like the major triad and C E F A inverted<br/>major 7th.  At the &quot;worst&quot; you can simply clean up fuzzy/ambiguous-sounding<br/>12TET chords...at best, you can unlock whole new musical worlds.</p></div><h3><a id=91679 href="#91679">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2010 10:37:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would say that this naming terminology is on the whole really good,<br/>&gt; although the use of &quot;augmented&quot; and &quot;diminished&quot; to reflect<br/>&gt; quarter-tone shifted intervals will likely cause some confusion.

I can think of<br/>very few cases where more than 5-6 types of a note are needed to describe all<br/>the non blurred/non-fuzzy/non-in-between-sounding intervals.  Take for example<br/>the third.  5/4 would be major, 6/5 would be minor, 11/9 would be neutral, and<br/>8/7 diminished.</p><p>  If you go up to 9/7, you basically have a fourth sounding tone (the diminished<br/>fourth)...and going down to 9/8 makes it sound like a second.

Same goes with intervals like 22/15...it&apos;s like having a<br/>particularly strong sandbar instead of a beach.  I&apos;d suggest making note of such<br/>&quot;odd but strong intervals&quot; but do things like describe 22/15 as a &quot;more sad<br/>sounding version of a perfect 5th&quot; rather than it&apos;s own weird name.  Personally<br/>I just call them &quot;alternative 5ths/4ths/etc.&quot; as a way of saying &quot;they can<br/>substitute fairly well for other versions of the note, but are going to sound a<br/>bit more blurred due to harmonic entropy and X is the emotional characteristic<br/>of said blur&quot;.</p><p>_,_._,___</p></div><h3><a id=91709 href="#91709">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/12/2010 12:52:01 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I do, in fact, have an old page that covers this:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/31eq.htm">http://x31eq.com/31eq.htm</a></p><p>You can tell it&apos;s important because I named the website after it.

Probably<br/>&gt; the trickiest thing to do cleanly and concisely is to define interval<br/>&gt; classes. Basically, the approach that holds the most appeal to me is to have<br/>&gt; a nomenclature based on the standard diatonic interval classes, with<br/>&gt; &quot;subminor, supermajor, and neutral&quot; thrown in to the mix, as well as having<br/>&gt; major and minor tritones that are distinct from the augmented fourth and<br/>&gt; diminished fifth, and having an augmented unison and diminished octave. IOW,<br/>&gt; use the interval class names of 31-tET, which (IMVHO) is about as<br/>&gt; fine-grained of a differentiation as can audibly be perceived. But rather<br/>&gt; than defining them according to specific intervals, I&apos;ve opted to give<br/>&gt; *approximate* ranges for them, based on 36 &amp; 48-EDO (since they are related<br/>&gt; to 12-tET, and thus are simple fractions of the semitone...though I&apos;m<br/>&gt; considering basing it on 48 &amp; 72 to improve the accuracy a bit). I list as<br/>&gt; well the simplest frequency ratio to be found in each interval class, as the<br/>&gt; &quot;ideal&quot; example of the class.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Behold the table here:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/0L1hTHnsn9vQG8ONtyJRSOqZD_nzx82L_y3vHFwcq-GbJXgqgRWt1pgQz-wPQLeZz60pqvXqLRWa-NKDzK7rhuFRlc8-MnCDMztFnXtbwADx0LM/Igliashon%20Jones/Interval%20Classes%20in%201st%20Octave.pdf">http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/0L1hTHnsn9vQG8ONtyJRSOqZD_nzx82L_y3vHFwcq-GbJXgqgRWt1pgQz-wPQLeZz60pqvXqLRWa-NKDzK7rhuFRlc8-MnCDMztFnXtbwADx0LM/Igliashon%20Jones/Interval%20Classes%20in%201st%20Octave.pdf</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (or see my folder in the &quot;Files&quot; section if that link gets mangled)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ve tried to take harmonic entropy into account where possible, but if<br/>&gt; we relied only on harmonic entropy to define interval classes, we&apos;d have a<br/>&gt; lumpy and uneven taxonomy which (also IMVHO) would be less useful than one<br/>&gt; like Margo&apos;s, which relies on ratios and mediants. My taxonomy is modeled<br/>&gt; after hers, but is quite a bit simplified--solely for the purpose of<br/>&gt; simplicity. I intend to introduce it as just one possible way of defining<br/>&gt; interval classes, one which is more vague than it may appear and not<br/>&gt; perfectly accurate. The flipside of this fuzzy and inaccurate presentation<br/>&gt; is that I think it&apos;s very easily assimilable, it fits on one page, and it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t require much math or psychoacoustic understanding.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Feedback is welcomed!
