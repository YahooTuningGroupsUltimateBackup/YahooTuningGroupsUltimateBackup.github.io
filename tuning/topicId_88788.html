The male voices also know each other for several decades (summer<br/>camp, now on the AFMM Board).</p><p>The voices always line up in just harmonies except near the end ... as most<br/> of you know ... with some INCREDIBLE intervals that we must make sensible.<br/>  We use a just template with the altered intervals of 1/5th of a tone (39<br/>cents).</p><p>At first it is a bit disorienting ... and maybe this always remains on some<br/> level ... leads to intervals such as 460 cents, 640 cents, and 740 cents.</p><p>We had rehearsals every  Monday evening for months.  Sans some  shipwreck<br/>this should be a transcendent experience.</p><p>Concert to be mentioned in The New Yorker.  Hope some of you can make  this<br/>one.  It will be exciting.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>Director<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music</p><p>MicroNYC 2010: May 15, Saturday, 8 PM, Church of St. Luke in the  Fields,<br/>487 Hudson Street<br/>Greenwich Village</p><p>_www.afmm.org_ (<a href="http://www.afmm.org">http://www.afmm.org</a>)</p></div>
