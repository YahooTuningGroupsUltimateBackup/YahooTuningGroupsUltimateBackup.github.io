At this time, I have a student (about 24) with a lot of talent,<br/>but he doesn&apos;t like blues, based on the noodly jam sessions he&apos;s gone<br/>to, and the blandness of Kenny Wayne Shepherd. There&apos;s a bit of humor<br/>here, as he&apos;s never even heard any of the greats, Howlin Wolf, etc, so<br/>I&apos;m going to see if he can be swayed in his rather limited opinion of<br/>this marvelous art form. Maybe not, of course...in which case, I cannot<br/>imagine him ever being a meaningful jazz player (which is his<br/>direction), since jazz is firmly based on the bedrock of the blues. When<br/>Stevie Ray died, I knew we were in for a bad time, because our culture<br/>makes icons out of dead artists...now, there&apos;s a big push for folks to<br/>sound (and at times, even look) like SRV. Which is the death of blues,<br/>or any sort of creative statement.<br/>    BTW, guitar fans should check out Metheny&apos;s new Live Trio album...I<br/>heard one disc, and was mighty impressed at the creativity, the chops,<br/>and the wide stylistic range. There&apos;s a blues (Soul Cowboy) that really<br/>takes the form way out, harmonically and rhymthically, and a free piece<br/>that reminded me more of Fripp than Metheny...real whacked and<br/>psychedelic. Very micro sounding, as well..if the rest of the CD is that<br/>good, yow. Pat has reached a profound level in his development; he&apos;s<br/>integrated all his influences into a very personal style, with great<br/>skills as a composer and improvisor...something for everyone to strive<br/>for...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=17791 href="#17791">ðŸ”—</a>Todd Wilcox &#x3C;twilcox@patriot.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2001 12:36:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil wrote:<br/>&gt; blues.

I would have<br/>thought that people into SRV would be more interested in sounding like Jimi<br/>Hendrix, who is my favorite electric blues player, but maybe people realize<br/>they could NEVER sound like Jimi, without realizing they could never sound<br/>like Stevie, either.</p><p>There are some great bluesmen out there with their own sounds (John Hammond<br/>comes to mind) but I do find myself listening to the radio and thinking<br/>&quot;sounds like SRV, but clearly is not,&quot; many times.<br/>Good luck with that student!</p><p>Todd</p></div>
