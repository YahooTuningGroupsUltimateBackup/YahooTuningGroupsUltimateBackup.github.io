I hade been<br/>&gt; listening to music and playing music for 30 years before I heard it<br/>&gt; demonstrated, although I had read about it, and my jaw just dropped.  I<br/>&gt; think you need to have a really stable signal for it to work, a synthesizer<br/>&gt; or a well maintained pipe organ</p><p>A well-maintained pipe organ, if equal tempered, would have no pure<br/>intervals.</p><p>&gt; Bob G.</p><p>I would surmise that what you are describing is the unique psychoacoustic<br/>effect that one experiences when the difference tone falls *exactly* into<br/>a harmonic series which includes the sounded tones and all their harmonics,<br/>the implied fundamental of which is within the frequency range of the ear<br/>(above 20-25 Hz).  All of the heard frequency components (incident and<br/>ear-generated) are then &quot;phase-locked&quot;, and the perception of consonance is<br/>greatly heightened.  This is exactly the &apos;drug&apos; which all us JI junkies are<br/>addicted to.  Incidently, in the pursuit of my psychoacoustical studies, I<br/>invented an electronic instrument which I call a &quot;Harmonichord&quot; which<br/>simultaneously generates all the tones of the harmonic series up to the 32nd<br/>harmonic _phase-locked_ to the fundamental. Any combination of harmonics can<br/>be played by a two-dimensional touch-membrane keyboard.  The fundamental is<br/>tunable over a three-octave range up to about middle C.  This is the instument<br/>which I use to explore the phenomenon of difference tones.</p><p>Fred R.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a href="http://webmail.netscape.com">http://webmail.netscape.com</a>.</p></div>
