All of this stems from the<br/>recent time I&apos;ve put in listening to these essentially-tempered<br/>&quot;dyadic chords,&quot; things like (245/243-tempered) 1/1-9/7-5/3, or<br/>(875/864-tempered) 1/1-6/5-36/25-7/4.</p><p>These chords are truly magical, and their characteristic nature is<br/>that they imply more than one VF, and different ones can be brought<br/>out via what you&apos;re look for. Since &quot;musical context&quot; is a nice<br/>systematic way to make you look for something, these chords are<br/>goldmines in that they have more than one interpretation which can be<br/>brought out contextually. For any VF that you hear in one of these<br/>chords, the other incompatible notes are generally heard the same way<br/>that you hear the major 6th in a major 6 chord - it&apos;s like 4:5:6 with<br/>some nice vaguely pseudo-harmonic junk on top.</p><p>Another chord that fits this description perfectly is the minor chord,<br/>which likewise has a few different choices of VF (and/or &quot;root&quot;),<br/>which are selected by musical context. I think that there are a few<br/>different ways to perceive minor triads:</p><p>(1:)10:12:15 - how pleasant, a major 7 chord! (fully resolved)<br/>(1:)(junk:)4:5 - when you hear it as a major 6 chord in 2nd inversion<br/>(1:)16:19:24 - the familiar &quot;sad&quot; version</p><p>So this postulates that when we hear minor triads as being &quot;rooted&quot;<br/>and hence &quot;sad,&quot; the &quot;sadness&quot; comes from that we&apos;re biasing virtual<br/>pitch perception into hearing them akin to (1:)16:19:24, which is more<br/>complex and hence more dissonant and hence &quot;sad.&quot; I believe that Petr<br/>mentioned that we didn&apos;t always hear minor chords as &quot;sad but rooted<br/>chords&quot; but in the early Renaissance were treated like &quot;unresolved<br/>acoustic cloudiness&quot;, which I also think is noteworthy.</p><p>In short, I think that 96/95 might be a fundamental comma in the<br/>perception of western music.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Sun, Sep 18, 2011 at 10:42 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve gone back through the tuning archives and looked for discussion<br/>&gt; on the psychoacoustic basis of the minor chord.

Could you prove me wrong?</p><p>No, obviously I can&apos;t. I also can&apos;t prove that 16:19:24 is right<br/>either, nor can you prove that it&apos;s wrong. In fact, we won&apos;t be able<br/>to prove any of this until we can do some kind of MEG like they did<br/>with the subjects here:</p><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2565400/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2565400/</a></p><p>However, we can throw around some educated ideas just for fun. In this<br/>case, my idea was a simple proposal that&apos;s worth adding to the list of<br/>possible explanations for &quot;minorness,&quot; and hence also to the list of<br/>ways to generalize it to hunt around for new minor chords.</p><p>16:19:24 becomes a decent candidate if you assume the following</p><p>1) Virtual pitch integration occurs over the entire spectrum, meaning<br/>the notes in the bass count as well<br/>2) In western music assuming octave equivalence, the lowest note is<br/>doubled down a few octaves, which means that 16:19:24 is more like<br/>1:2:4:8:16:19:24 or something.<br/>3) 1:2:4:8:16:19:24 is simpler than 5:10:20:40:80:96:120 (10:12:15 on<br/>top), and also simpler than 4:8:16:32:64:77:96 (your chord), so<br/>inasmuch as harmonic entropy means anything, it&apos;s going to be a more<br/>likely choice.</p><p>I think that these are decent assumptions to make, so I&apos;m proposing<br/>it. Also, the fact that you can hear minor chords as being relative<br/>minors of major chords (or maj6omit5 chords in inversion) would<br/>suggest that this could be well analyzed as an essentially<br/>96/95-tempered chord. I obviously have no proof for this, but I think<br/>it&apos;s worth an exploration for anyone interested in the line of<br/>research of how to come up with new xenharmonic minor chords. I&apos;m<br/>personally interested in it because whereas I find major is easy<br/>enough to generalize (moar otonality!), minor has been far more<br/>difficult.</p><p>The other essentially-tempered chords also generalize the multiplicity<br/>of perceptions inherent in the minor chord, and I note particularly<br/>that the 875/864 tempered &quot;magical seventh&quot; chord sounds like a<br/>diminished seventh in which the outer 7/4 &quot;roots&quot; it - kind of a<br/>similar feeling to what minor does to my ears. They do mix random JI<br/>chord &quot;qualities&quot; together in interesting and novel ways. The<br/>245/243-tempered stack of two 9/7&apos;s likewise has this dual perception<br/>as 9/7 + junk on top, or 5/3 + junk in the middle, and I like that<br/>quite a bit. I suggest that they may be a good starting point for<br/>designing &quot;sad&quot; chords if you want - just construct an<br/>essentially-tempered chord in which one of the possible<br/>interpretations involves higher complexity and more dissonance, and<br/>see what you can get.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
