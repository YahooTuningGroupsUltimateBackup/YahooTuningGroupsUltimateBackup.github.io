(No surprise there)</p><p>&quot;Although the observations suggest that the hammer can make a rubbing<br/>motion against the string during contact, it has not yet been shown<br/>that such a motion takes place. Even if it does, it remains to be<br/>shown that a motion of this kind could influence the string<br/>excitation and hence the tone quality.&quot;</p><p>See also<br/><a href="http://www.speech.kth.se/music/5_lectures/askenflt/keybott.html">http://www.speech.kth.se/music/5_lectures/askenflt/keybott.html</a></p><p>&quot;Interestingly, the magnitude of this shift in timing with level was<br/>about the same for an untrained subject as for a professional<br/>pianist...&quot;</p><p>Controlling the absolute timbre of individual tones is surely a wild<br/>goose chase compared to the work that everyone can do on controlling<br/>artistically the relative dynamics of different notes in a piece. If<br/>you listen to great classical pianists the vital thing they use is<br/>playing on several different dynamic levels at the same time.

Key paragraph:<br/>&quot;&quot;One final comment. The effect of hammershank vibration can<br/>be observed by the effect it has on causing hammer head to<br/>move (the shank/head glue joint is effectively rigid). This<br/>can change the contact footprint (scuffing). A 4ms contact,<br/>for instance, corresponds to a 250Hz cycle, so the shank<br/>vibration frequencies are definitely in the range where about<br/>1 cycle or more occurs during contact with the string. If the<br/>amplitude is large enough and friction with the hammerhead<br/>and string is low enough you can typically expect motion in<br/>the order of 1mm during contact for a loud bow with a flexing<br/>hammershank. This scuffing we have observed with high speed<br/>imaging. We have also confirmed the frequencies with strain<br/>gages mounted on the top of the shank. All during regular<br/>playing of the key, not artificially clamped and driven<br/>hammershanks.&quot;&quot;</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=71211 href="#71211">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2007 5:22:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Andrew Hunt&quot; &lt;aahunt@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Tom.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess you must be a pianist?</p><p>I play piano, harpsichord and clavichord</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m curious because<br/>&gt; the technique you describe of keeping fingers on the keys</p><p>If you read what I wrote, and think a little about it, you will<br/>discover what I meant was maintaining contact BEFORE the hammer<br/>strikes, and using it to control dynamic.

Brahms&apos;s<br/>counterpoint is heavy-handed Â– it depends on the size of<br/>one&apos;s hands how it can be managed, and playing it dry is often<br/>impossible, such that a dry sound (right or wrong) isn&apos;t what&apos;s<br/>expected for Brahms. Glenn Gould&apos;s Brahms recordings exemplify<br/>a drier sound. Gould is one pianist who, whether you like his<br/>interpretations or not, indisputably had the absolute dynamic<br/>and rhythmic control which is necessary for the clear articulation<br/>of counterpoint at the piano, and it is well known that he<br/>preferred the light and quick action of his Chickering.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div><h3><a id=71219 href="#71219">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2007 12:03:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>SNIP</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;it was observed by Kirk in 1959 that a carefully and competently<br/>&gt; tuned piano had the strings of the trichords tuned slightly<br/>&gt; differently by an amount that appeared to vary randomly from note to<br/>&gt; note.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~~~T~~~<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>I noticed this myself, particularly with the bass strings.</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3><a id=71225 href="#71225">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2007 12:30:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Yes, Charles Rosen writes very well about it.

Brahms certainly<br/>sounds heavy if the chords and lines are not carefully voiced. The<br/>worst that can happen is for someone to imagine that each note<br/>deserves to be equally loud unless marked otherwise. As for<br/>impossibility, consider carefully how important it may be for this or<br/>that line to have a continuous legato...</p><p>There are a lot of places in Brahms where no pedal is marked and one<br/>wonders what was meant - prime example a late G minor piece I think<br/>op.118 with each hand going its way through continuous three-part<br/>chords, some marked staccato, some not. Well, David Owen Norris tried<br/>it on an old Streicher (BBC radio prog I heard) and it worked fine<br/>without any pedal in the opening statement. He (Brahms) was also<br/>somewhat fond of rapid staccato bass lines which tend to fall a bit<br/>flat if the damping is immediate, so pianists try and pedal over<br/>them, which of course ruins it in a different way.</p><p>Gould&apos;s Brahms is indeed interesting - a lot more than his Bach, to<br/>me - though it might have been even more so had he used an older<br/>piano, say a Baldwin or Bechstein.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>PS looking for counterpoint in Chopin, try the Ballades!
