Theory<br/>Five-Dimensional Sound-Musical Continuum materializes itself into<br/>objective Sound Space and subjective Musical Space defined as MOS-Musical<br/>Organisation of Sound. Sound-Musical Space is defined as union of the<br/>sets: A the set of parameters related to the sound signal at its source,<br/>B the set of<br/>parameters of the sound signal with a listener. A and B interactions<br/>with binary relations of ordered pairs represents the new set C. MOS<br/>defined as set X<br/>implicates Y as set of aural, final psychological perception of music.</p><p>II. Experiments<br/>Quantum of Hearing Discrimination was elaborated in experiments MATEST 1<br/>and 2 with values in cents ranged from 3-7, extreme 2, being constant along<br/>the greater part of the frequency spectrum, 4 cents. Unit called Unitary<br/>Distance was defined. Phase Space Cell signifies distribution of DTR<br/>within the<br/>Sound-Musical Space as matrix. MATEST 2 included several different tonal<br/>systems for comparison and DTR system justification.</p><p>III. Practice DTR-Discrete<br/>Tone Relations: 1. Hearing discrimination 2. Temperament 3. Intonation<br/>4. Musical abilities 5. Compositional organization of DTR 6.Ortography<br/>and notation<br/>7. Reproductive medium with its limits 8. Constructing new musical<br/>instruments 9. Aesthetics and axiology</p><p>KEYWORDS: discrete, tone, relations, DTR, UD, unitary, distance, STTR,<br/>PSC, phase, space, cells, QHd, quantum, hearing, discrimination, phenomenon,<br/>sound, musical, continuum, fivedimensional, matest, system</p><p>TOC:<br/>Introduction<br/>I. Theoretical aspects:</p><p>              1. General conception of universal sound-musical manifestation<br/>              2. Materialization of sound-musical continuum into union<br/>of sets of all musical parameters,<br/>              3. Defining of tone pitches and their relations on the<br/>base of quantum theory i.e. discrete atributs of sound-musical space,<br/>              4. Presentation of discrete tone relations system and its<br/>implications in regard to hearing phenomenon</p><p>II. Experimental aspects:</p><p>              5. Experimental determination of hearing threshold value<br/>and quantum of hearing discrimination within the range of discrete tone<br/>pitches and their<br/>              relations<br/>              6. Projection of discrete tone relation systems and<br/>selection of its optimal variants<br/>              7. Testing of discrete tone relations system in relation<br/>to already existing tone systems and proofs of its universality,<br/>validity and practical benefits</p><p>III. Practical aspects:</p><p>              8. Practical application of discrete tone relations from<br/>the aspect of contemporary musical science<br/>              9. Discrete tone relations application from the aspect of<br/>reproductive musical media,<br/>              10. Systematization of theoretical and practical results<br/>of discrete tone relations phenomenon research, Summary, Literature,<br/>Application of<br/>              references towards fundamental theses of dissertation.</p><p>CONTACT:<br/>P.
