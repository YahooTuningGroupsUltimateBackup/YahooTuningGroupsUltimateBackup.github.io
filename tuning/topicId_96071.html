If you<br/>do use the right kind of timbre, it&apos;s beautiful. I&apos;m also not sure<br/>exactly how to map it, because it&apos;s not really a &quot;temperament&quot; in the<br/>normal sense. There are probably a bunch of mappings that support<br/>this, which is more like a concept, or maybe a temperament &quot;paradigm,&quot;<br/>or who knows.</p><p>I said in my last message to the list that getting into Blackwood was<br/>a transformative experience in my paradigm of how this all works, and<br/>the first scale to really break me fully out of the &quot;diatonic&quot;<br/>paradigm. Rather than mapping 5/4 to a bunch of fifths, you let the<br/>fifths do their own thing, and then add in a second contorted chain of<br/>fifths offset by 5/4. Then you get some kind of kaleidoscopic<br/>symmetric diatonic scale, which is beautiful. And the puns are also<br/>really beautiful.</p><p>So I sought to recreate this feel with father temperament, by taking<br/>the really sharp fifths and then just sticking a 5/4 in there such<br/>that the whole thing makes somewhat recognizable 4:5:6 triads. So I<br/>guess the criteria here is that 256/243 end up reversed. I have set it<br/>such that the fifths have a lower boundary of 5-equal and an upper<br/>boundary of 8-equal, which is like the absolute maximum to hear them<br/>as fifths at all, but I don&apos;t want 5/4 to equate to 4/3. 26-equal is a<br/>good choice if you use the sharper mapping for the fifth. Play some<br/>major triads around the circle of fifths and it works really well.</p><p>As for a mapping - I&apos;m not sure how to do it. On one end you have<br/>8-equal with the wide fifth mapping, which is about a maximum of<br/>recognizability, and on the other hand you have 15-equal as the other<br/>bound. Graham&apos;s temperament finder spits out porcupine for 8&amp;15,<br/>though, which ain&apos;t right. So I went with 8&amp;10, which gives you a<br/>temperament called &quot;supersharp&quot; that has 2/1 mapped to 2 periods;<br/>sounds like we&apos;re headed in the right direction but I&apos;m not sure<br/>that&apos;s the only way to go, either. 8&amp;25 gives you an interesting<br/>unnamed scale.

Mapping 6/5 to +6 generators is really<br/>interesting. It seems to be most appropriate to say that this is the<br/>planar temperament where 256/243 is reversed and 8192/6561 is not.<br/>Using Bosanquet&apos;s terminology, 8 and 23 map this to a 256/243<br/>singly-negative temperament.

So 3 fifths gets you to 7/4; this works really well.</p><p>My first approach with this scale was to just play 4:5:6&apos;s, if you can<br/>still call them that, all the way around the circle of fifths, and<br/>observe the more and more exotic roots I was landing on. The MOS&apos;s<br/>don&apos;t really throw much 5 in there, though, so I guess I was thinking<br/>about this more like a simple 28/27 planar temperament, of which<br/>eliminating 256/245 gives us this, and eliminating 16/15 gives us<br/>father.</p><p>Another interesting, but related thing from this is that the 7:11:14<br/>recurrence relation is right around here, which gives a nice pleasant<br/>buzz. 7:14 is almost exactly 5\8, so a good way to do this is to start<br/>with 8-tet and then add another 8-tet chain, blackwood style, offset<br/>by ~11/7. Since there&apos;s no point pretending that this is perceived as<br/>anything but out of tune 5-limit harmony, this then is the 5-limit<br/>temperament eliminating 8192/6561.</p><p>Not sure I&apos;ll ever use these too much, but at least as of the present<br/>moment they&apos;re tripping me out pretty good.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
