His &apos;Thoughts on playing concert music&apos; were published 1777.<br/>Here from the section &apos;On pure</p><p>&apos;A teacher instructs his pupil to make the half note [semitone] by<br/>putting the finger close to the one it succeeds ... when the student<br/>is once able to tune his instrument, the insufficiency of that rule<br/>should be made known to him. ... this same first rule, by which all<br/>the sharps are made too sharp, and the flats too flat, even if the<br/>fingers are thick, is evidently the only one attended to by many of<br/>the Dilettanti.&apos;</p><p>&apos;Tune can only be ascertained by comparing one sound to another ...<br/>that performer who thinks he plays in tune, and yet whose ear cannot<br/>refine all the concords with the same degree of certainty it can a<br/>fifth or eighth, does but deceive himself and disappoint others.&apos;</p><p>&apos;Of ... the 5th and 8th, we shall ... suppose the student to be<br/>master. The others are in like manner adjusted by comparing them with<br/>one or other of the open strings, they being the tests by which Tune<br/>can be best ascertained... In playing these examples, a slow and even<br/>bow is recommended, as thereby the fingers will have time to move<br/>backward and forward in search of truth&apos;</p><p>(NB, these are *exercises* in pure intonation!)</p><p>&apos;The note F is to be so stopped that the open string A may become a<br/>perfect 3d to it... The 3d being thoroughly adjusted [ie as pure as<br/>the fifth or octave] let the finger on F remain in its place, to which<br/>let B flat be made a perfect 4th. ... If these two chords are in exact<br/>tune, they fix the flat stops of two fingers on all the strings [i.e.<br/>the minor second and minor third above the open strings].&apos;</p><p>B flat is then tested against G an octave above the open string G and<br/>the open string D, to produce a pure minor 3rd and 6th respectively.</p><p>&apos;The major, or greater 6th, only now remains to be treated of, and may<br/>be found thus: The note G tuned by its octave, to that G, tune a B a<br/>major 3rd, which B is a major 6th to D.&apos;</p><p>&apos;As 3ds and 6ths are the most difficult for the ear to perfect, the<br/>following example should be much practised; in the performing of<br/>which, the finger should be made to glide ... from one semi-tone to<br/>the other, till the ear be thoroughly satisfied, and well acquainted<br/>with what is, and what is not tune.&apos;</p><p>Violin examples: double stops D-A -&gt; D-Bb -&gt; D-Bnat, C-E -&gt; C#-E</p><p>&apos;That the eye may be satisfied as wwell as the ear, let the chords<br/>below (double stops G-B, G-C) ... be put in exact tune, and if the<br/>fingers stopping B and C are retained in their places, it may be seen,<br/>that though C is but a semi-tone above B, yet those fingers are not<br/>close to each other...&apos;</p><p>&apos;... if the student makes a point of giving due attention to tune on<br/>all occasions, his ear will soon become master of it ... for if alone,<br/>he has his own open strings for a test; and when with others, one or<br/>other of their parts, to which he may be a concord, will be his guide.&apos;</p><p>Perhaps this makes it more obvious to interpret the remarks of Quantz<br/>quoted by Haynes.</p><p> &quot;Every harpsichordist ... will also know that minor semitones like<br/>D-D# and E-Eb, etc, differ by a comma, and therefore cause on this<br/>instrument (unless the keys are split) certain intonation problems<br/>with other instruments that play these notes in their correct<br/>proportions. ... since these notes cannot always be avoided ... the<br/>accompanist does well to put them in the middle or lower part of the<br/>chord, or if such a note makes a minor third [eg Db above Bb], to omit<br/>it altogether.&quot;</p><p> &quot;... the other instruments play [notes such as Cb, D#] in their<br/>correct ratios, whereas on the harpsichord they are merely tempered.<br/>For this reason, it is better to omit them entirely [from the<br/>harpsichord], rather than offend the ear.&quot;</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2006 12:34:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Quotes from Early Music 7 (1979): Bremner was a Scots 18th century<br/>&gt; music  publisher, violinist (a pupil of Geminiani) and who knows what<br/>&gt; else.

It seems his ideas weren&apos;t systematized to the point of<br/>giving an explicit and coherent total system of intonation.

However, in playing a string<br/>duet, there&apos;s nothing preventing another player from taking<br/>the low G.</p><p>At which point we ask ourselves: How should the C sound?<br/>If we take it a pure fourth above the G, the third CE will<br/>be impure; if we take it a pure major third below the E, the<br/>fourth GC will be impure.</p><p>However, Bremner requires that the &quot;double stops G-B, G-C)<br/>... be put in exact tune&quot;; this instruction appears<br/>immediately after playing the &quot;double stops D-A -&gt; D-Bb -&gt;<br/>D-Bnat, C-E -&gt; C#-E&quot;.  Yet he does not mention that the Cs of<br/>these double-stops should be different!</p><p>This signifies one of the following:<br/>(a) That he is unaware they&apos;re different.  (Not likely.)</p><p>(b) That he wants both Cs to be a perfect fourth above the G.<br/>(Hang the third, it&apos;s a comma sharp, so what?)</p><p>(c) That he wants both Cs to be a just major third below the<br/>E.  (Hang the fifth, etc.)</p><p>(d) That he wants them both the same, and tempered.  (But I<br/>don&apos;t think - from the text quoted - he&apos;s a fan of tempering<br/>the violin intervals at all; though more recent players are.)</p><p>(e) That he wants them both different, and both pure to the<br/>other sounding string. (Then smart composers would never<br/>double-stop GC on the second violin with CE on the first,<br/>since that would produce dissonant Cs.  I could live with<br/>that; it&apos;s common to blame the composer whenever there&apos;s an<br/>intonation problem!)</p><p>Solutions (d) and (e) seem likeliest for Bremner, with (d)<br/>being the classical approach.</p><p>FWIW, as a violin player (briefly), my intonation practice<br/>aimed chiefly at producing the best consonances possible<br/>under the circumstances: pure intervals when playing solo,<br/>tempered when playing notes doubled by any other instrument,<br/>or with a continuo, and with a distinct leaning towards purer<br/>thirds than fourths.</p><p>Please note I&apos;m not being prescriptive; rather, I&apos;m just<br/>recording my own biases.</p><p>&gt; (And there is some room for the fifths to be very slightly<br/>narrowed in historical evidence.) Therefore I believe in<br/>practice some intervals must have been significantly impure,<br/>at least without extensive rehearsal.</p><p>Given a single rehearsal, performers of flexible pitch<br/>instruments usually align their tuning to the ensemble.<br/>IME - YMMV.</p><p>&gt; However, it does indicate the importance that one<br/>experienced later 18th-century musician placed on being able<br/>to hear and play pure intervals, as a basic method of training.</p><p>Absolutely!  However, demanding facility in producing pure<br/>intervals as part of practice does not automatically preclude<br/>making another demand, to produce suitably tempered intervals<br/>in ensemble performance.  What did Bremner have to say on the<br/>latter subject?</p><p>&gt; It would be interesting to see what range of fifths or thirds<br/>could be accepted as pure on a violin - clearly there must be<br/>some range of tolerance.</p><p>Of course; and some student players of my acquaintance could<br/>never achieve tolerable accuracy, which is exactly why we,<br/>teachers and students alike, encouraged them to take up<br/>woodwork ...  To the best of my recollection, the acceptable<br/>standard of tuning was that the student&apos;s sembibreve (whole<br/>note) was in unison with the teacher&apos;s, without perceptible<br/>beats.  That suggests a tuning accuracy of a quarter of a Hertz<br/>or better, doesn&apos;t it?</p><p>&gt; Those quotations are by no means the last word - I&apos;ve got<br/>the 1991 Early Music article by Barbieri on &apos;Violin intonation&apos;<br/>lined up as well.</p><p>Please don&apos;t rush on - what did Bremner say about intonation<br/>when playing in ensemble?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div>
