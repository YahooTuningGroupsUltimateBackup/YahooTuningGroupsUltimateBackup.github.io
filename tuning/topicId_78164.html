The interval of repetition/equivalence/whatever is<br/>the pure fifth, so you might even say that 9:4 is the &quot;octave&quot;.</p><p>Conjunct pentachords. The &quot;sharp octave&quot; is just the third tone of<br/>the second pentachord.</p><p>An important concept of tetrachordal, pentachordal and<br/>hemioctachordal constructions is that the octave, pure or otherwise,<br/>is more or less a byproduct, and not necessarily a fundamental<br/>interval.</p><p>I believe that this is one reason why it is possible to float things<br/>like, say, a 670 cent &quot;fifth&quot; in a triadic harmony without anyone<br/>even realizing: when this interval is, in the genes, a small major<br/>second above the 4/3 and not actually a &quot;fifth&quot; at all, and the music<br/>is tetrachordal in the soul, it will work. The other reason is that<br/>you can stack pretty much any damn kinds of different thirds or<br/>sixths and get a good chord in isolation- then the easily digestible<br/>logic of tetrachord or pentachord-anchored melodic movement holds the<br/>chords together in a perceptible way.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;robert thomas<br/>martin&quot; &lt;robertthomasmartin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MicroMadeEasy@yahoogroups.com">MicroMadeEasy@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;John H.
