[1]</p><p>Assume that in harmonic music, that is, with more<br/>than two tones, which will be our subject matter<br/>here, Parncutt&apos;s theory of &quot;tonalness&quot; has significant<br/>validity.  This theory states that a collection<br/>of tones heard together will strongly imply segments<br/>of a harmonic series and its fundamental, even if<br/>the actual pitches belonging to that set are not<br/>present.  In a case where the the ratios of the<br/>tones in the chord imply one series, and the<br/>combination (summation and difference) tones imply<br/>another, a sort of &quot;best fit&quot; fundamental will be<br/>perceived.  The lattice is a good generalized model<br/>of his proposition.</p><p>Assume also that I am not taking a stance here in<br/>the prime/odd dichotomy, and that when I say<br/>&quot;prime&quot; it can just as well stand for &quot;odd&quot; with<br/>the mathematics adjusted.  I *do* believe that<br/>prime-factoring is important in our listening<br/>habits, but that&apos;s tangential to my main point<br/>here, which is the mental process itself and the<br/>ambiguity involved in it; what follows will work<br/>similarly for non-prime odd-factors; I will stick<br/>to a description in terms of prime-factors.</p><p>The last assumption is that of &quot;octave&quot;-equivalence.<br/>Though scales can be constructed which do not<br/>have &quot;octaves&quot;, and good music can be written<br/>with them, most harmonic systems take &quot;octave&quot;-<br/>equivalence for granted, and I will do so here<br/>also.  This simply ignores factors of 2, and<br/>if necessary, 2 can be included in the theory<br/>in the same way as the other primes.</p><p>Now down to the matter at hand.</p><p>Start with a centrist view.  Our hearing mechanism<br/>allows us to recognize sounds from roughly 20 Hz to<br/>roughly 20,000 Hz.  There are sounds at either end<br/>which are audible to some other animals but not to<br/>we humans.  So we can&apos;t reference to any external<br/>absolute &quot;C&quot;, for example. (perhaps we can do this<br/>in notation, but not in actual listening)</p><p>There has to be one specific point from within our<br/>range of hearing which we use as a reference<br/>and from which we will recognize all other pitches.</p><p>To a large extent, we&apos;ve already produced &quot;middle-C&quot;<br/>as this reference, and there is also widespread use of<br/>tuning to &quot;A&quot; at or somewhere near 440 Hz.  Regardless<br/>of how well-defined it is, we take some pitch as our<br/>reference 1/1.  Were the &quot;octaves&quot; represented on the<br/>lattice, they would simply be straight vertical lines:</p><p>     upper limit of hearing</p><p>              /|\<br/>               |<br/>              4:1<br/>               |<br/>               |<br/>              2:1<br/>               |<br/>             __|__<br/>            | 1:1 |<br/>            |_____|<br/>               |<br/>              1:2<br/>               |<br/>               |<br/>              1:4<br/>               |<br/>              \|/</p><p>     lower limit of hearing</p><p>Ignoring the &quot;octaves&quot;, and modelling our understanding<br/>of the musical harmony as a prime-factor lattice,<br/>we tend to think of harmonic expansion from our<br/>reference 1/1 in two main ways.  One model is a chain<br/>or cycle of powers of 3, or &quot;steps&quot; of a &quot;5th&quot;, on a<br/>few low-prime axes:</p><p>1)<br/>====</p><p>3-axis alone<br/>                          27:16<br/>                           /<br/>                          /<br/>                         /<br/>                       9:8<br/>                       /<br/>                      /<br/>                     /<br/>                   3:2<br/>                   /<br/>                  /<br/>                 /<br/>               1:1<br/>               /<br/>              /<br/>             /<br/>           4:3<br/>           /<br/>          /<br/>         /<br/>      16:9<br/>       /<br/>      /<br/>     /<br/>   32:27</p><p>- this example is a type of Pythagorean &quot;major&quot; scale,<br/>just a chain of 3/2s, or powers of 3.

It provides two 3/2s,<br/>one 9/8, one 5/4, one 7/4, one 11/8, and the intervals<br/>resulting from their combinations.  The factors of the<br/>collection are the primes 3, 5, 7, and 11, each to the<br/>first power, and the composite odd number 9, which is<br/>3 to the second power.</p><p>Actually, the way we perceive harmony is usually a<br/>combination of these two models, the chain of exponents<br/>and the prime-factoring, each one being employed<br/>to varying degrees for different people and circumstances.<br/>The chain model tends to have a lateral orientation,<br/>while the prime model is overwhelmingly centric.</p><p>With the recognition of the xenharmonic bridges, the<br/>interchange between the two is dynamic and flexible.<br/>It&apos;s largely how both classical and Partchian tonality work.<br/>(Yes, Partch took advantage of xenharmonic bridges too.)</p><p>When we imagine that the ratios we&apos;re hearing wander<br/>out among the axes of the higher primes, say 11, 13,<br/>or 19, their exponents along the higher-primes axes<br/>stay as closely as possible to 1/1, usually right<br/>along the &quot;harmonic spiral&quot; [2] - in other words,<br/>whatever prime-factor, to the 1st power; that is,<br/>just the prime (or odd) harmonics themselves.</p><p>This is a vivid description on the lattice of Parncutt&apos;s<br/>&quot;tonalness&quot;.  The &quot;best fit&quot; case can be thought of as<br/>a whole series of xenharmonic bridges connecting to<br/>the central harmonic spiral of the &quot;best fit&quot; fundamental,<br/>from high among outlying axes, all pulling in different<br/>directions as they force our perception of the sound<br/>into the center of the lattice, as it were.</p><p>Shown in stages, the expansion of harmonic resources<br/>from 1 to 3:</p><p>                     3:2<br/>                     /<br/>                    /<br/>                   /<br/>                 1:1</p><p>to 5:</p><p>                     3:2<br/>                     /<br/>         5:4        /<br/>            &apos;-._   /<br/>                 1:1</p><p>to 7:</p><p>                     3:2<br/>                     /<br/>         5:4        /<br/>            &apos;-._   /<br/>                 1:1------------7:4</p><p>to 11:</p><p>            11:8<br/>              |<br/>               |     3:2<br/>                |    /<br/>         5:4     |  /<br/>            &apos;-._  |/<br/>                 1:1------------7:4</p><p>to 13:</p><p>            11:8<br/>              |                   13:8<br/>               |     3:2        _.-&apos;<br/>                |    /      _.-&apos;<br/>         5:4     |  /   _.-&apos;<br/>            &apos;-._  |/_.-&apos;<br/>                 1:1------------7:4</p><p>etc.</p><p>These diagrams of the harmonic chords remind<br/>me of molecules that are open-ended and ready<br/>to bond with others.  Each identity of the chord<br/>is ready to assume a new identity of another<br/>chord if one comes by which has the right connectors<br/>open.</p><p>This is certainly part of the reason why the development<br/>of higher identities in harmony about a century ago led<br/>to the &quot;breakdown of tonality&quot;.  A harmonic module is<br/>rife with a chameleon-like potential to change its<br/>&quot;appearance&quot; and conform to a new host harmonic block.</p><p>Paradoxically, the harmonic modules also have a very<br/>centrist aspect themselves.  Their vectors all meet<br/>at 1/1, or whatever happens to be functioning as the<br/>local 1/1.  There is therefore much ambiguity built<br/>right into this structure.</p><p>When our perception of the ratios has their lattice<br/>points wandering farther away from this centrist model,<br/>deviating off the prime axes themselves, they<br/>are usually still imagined as being close by,<br/>on a composite axis.  Thus the higher-prime axis<br/>is replicated at the distance of one or more of<br/>the lower-primes, and so on, for however many<br/>factors the ratio has.

For example,<br/>while avoiding all ratios having 5 as a factor, La Monte<br/>Young, in the lattice of his tunings, still deploys<br/>chains of powers of 3 among the 7-limit ratios.<br/>Using the same lattice structure we&apos;ve been developing<br/>so far, here is La Monte&apos;s current tuning for<br/>&quot;The Well-Tuned Piano&quot;: [3]</p><p>                                567:512<br/>                                  /<br/>                                 /<br/>                                /<br/>                            189:128------1323:1024<br/>                              /              /<br/>                             /              /<br/>                            /              /<br/>          9:8------------63:32--------441:256<br/>          /               /              /<br/>         /               /              /<br/>        /               /              /<br/>      3:2------------21:16---------147:128<br/>      /               /              /<br/>     /               /              /<br/>    /               /              /<br/>  1:1-------------7:4-----------49:32</p><p>Even in many very large just-intonation systems, such<br/>as the one devised on a paper keyboard model by Henry<br/>Poole [4], with 100 different pitches to the &quot;octave&quot;,<br/>the ratios are in only 5 chains (the 1-, 5-, and 7-axes<br/>and their combinations) of up to 20 powers of 3 - a good<br/>example of what Partch called &quot;Poly-pythagoreanism&quot;. [5]</p><p>Of course, by modelling the harmonic system on the<br/>lattice, it&apos;s very easy to see that we could build<br/>a chain of 5/4s, or 7/4s, or any other series of<br/>exponents along any of the prime axes.</p><p>And when those higher-prime ratios become &quot;roots&quot;<br/>of chords themselves, other tones in the chord tend<br/>to stay as close as possible in lattice-distance,<br/>along the 3-, 5-, or sometimes 7- axes.</p><p>Think of the primary prime vectors as being in<br/>bold on the lattice diagram, with all other composite<br/>axes a thinner weight.

Good - he was already<br/>a part of this essay. - Note right here that his<br/>&quot;Theory of the Regions&quot; [6] is entirely centrist<br/>and monophonic in the Partchian sense, and in<br/>the sense of my harmonic lattice diagrams.</p><p>In his theory, a modulation into a new key<br/>never negated the original key - it was felt<br/>rather as a region with a distinct relationship<br/>to the original key.  Very much like moving<br/>around on the lattice.</p><p>In a more profound sense, this is also the basic<br/>idea behind the technique for composing with Erv<br/>Wilson&apos;s Combination Product Sets, such as the<br/>Hexany, which tend to eliminate a central &quot;fundamental&quot;<br/>and replace centric tonality with a kind derived<br/>from the combined intervallic relationships among<br/>all tones in a specific set but without referring<br/>to a center. [7]</p><p>Now we&apos;re approaching the more interesting stuff.</p><p>A few weeks back there was discussion here of<br/>what truly new things could be done in music.<br/>Perhaps this is where the new directions in harmony<br/>and tonality are going - imagining rational<br/>harmonic implications along different prime axes<br/>other than 3 and 5.</p><p>This is *exactly* what Schoenberg had in mind<br/>[I have references!], but he was willing to accept<br/>the amount of error in the 12-Eq scale and make the<br/>*utmost use of its ambiguities*.</p><p>He said in 1911 that &quot;5 is already far behind us&quot;,<br/>in a polemic against Schenker&apos;s mystical speculations<br/>about keeping a 5-limit in harmony. [8]</p><p>Schoenberg explicitly stated that &quot;in 12-tone compostion<br/>...almost everything that used to make up the ebb and<br/>flow of harmony [is], as far as possible, avoided&quot;.<br/>In other words, his aim was to discard all the 3- and<br/>5-limit rational implications - and &quot;to use only the<br/>new resources&quot; of 7, 11, and 13.</p><p>Schoenberg defined the 12-Eq scale as a conglomeration<br/>of the rational implications of the first 13 partials<br/>of the &quot;tonic&quot;, &quot;dominant&quot;, and &quot;subdominant&quot; tones,<br/>so he kept the chain of 3/2s only in its most basic<br/>sense: [9]</p><p>             33:32<br/>              /|<br/>             /  |                          _39:32<br/>            /    |                     _.-&apos;  /<br/>         11:8     |                _.-&apos;     /<br/>          /|       |           _.-&apos;        /<br/>         /  |15:8   |      _.-&apos;        _13:8<br/>        /   /|  &apos;-._ | _.-&apos;        _.-&apos;  /<br/>     11:6  /  |     3:2--------_.-&apos;21:16/<br/>       |  /    |    /      _.-&apos;     /  /<br/>        |5:4    |  /   _.-&apos;        /13:12<br/>        /|  &apos;-._ |/_.-&apos;        _.-/&apos;<br/>       /  |     1:1--------_.-&apos;-7:4<br/>      /    |    /      _.-&apos;     /<br/>    5:3     |  /   _.-&apos;        /<br/>       &apos;-._  |/_.-&apos;           /<br/>            4:3-------------7:6</p><p>This is my diagram of the famous analysis of the<br/>rational implications of the 12-Eq scale by<br/>Schoenberg which was ridiculed by Harry Partch. [10]</p><p>Compared to the lower-prime lattices, look at<br/>the beautiful new geometries that come into play<br/>with Schoenberg&apos;s scheme!</p><p>So his intention was to stop implying ratios with<br/>3 and 5 as factors, while emphasizing the implication<br/>of those of 7, 11, and 13.  Of course he wasn&apos;t trying<br/>to stick to this rule dogmatically, but his invention<br/>of &quot;pantonality&quot; (the term he himself preferred to<br/>the more current &quot;atonality&quot;) was a way to make<br/>use of these previously unexplored implications<br/>in the 12-Eq scale.  As he put it, &quot;at the root<br/>of this is the unconscious urge to try out the<br/>new resources independently&quot;. [11]</p><p>Of course, from an acoustical standpoint Partch&apos;s<br/>criticisms are entirely valid.  Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&quot;bridges&quot; are far larger intervals than any that<br/>I would call by that term, with the most absurd<br/>pair of &quot;equivalents&quot; being 33:32 and 13:12, tones<br/>which are separated by 85 cents!  But there was a<br/>very sound basis to Schoenberg&apos;s retention of 12-Eq,<br/>as we will find in a moment.</p><p>So taking out of our lattice not only the 5-axis<br/>(as in La Monte Young&apos;s tuning), but also the<br/>3-axis, leaves us with, as our basic harmonic<br/>building-blocks:</p><p>            11:8<br/>              |                   13:8<br/>               |                _.-&apos;<br/>                |           _.-&apos;<br/>                 |      _.-&apos;<br/>                  | _.-&apos;<br/>                 1:1------------7:4</p><p>(I should also mention that Schoenberg may have<br/>felt 9 to be a legitimate new identity, as do the<br/>odd-limit proponents, rather than simply another<br/>power of 3.  He does not explicity say one way or<br/>the other.  His actual model what the &quot;possibly<br/>uncertain&quot; overtone series, implying mainly an<br/>integer-limit approach.)</p><p>Let&apos;s build part of a lattice with only these elements,<br/>&quot;just&quot; to see what we get:</p><p>  121:64<br/>     |                     143:128<br/>      |                  _.-&apos; |<br/>       |             _.-&apos;      |<br/>        |        _.-&apos;           |<br/>         |   _.-&apos;                |<br/>         11:8----------77:64      |<br/>           |              |      13:8-----------91:64<br/>            |              |  _.-&apos;          _.-&apos;<br/>             |           _.-|&apos;          _.-&apos;<br/>              |      _.-&apos;    |      _.-&apos;<br/>               | _.-&apos;         | _.-&apos;<br/>              1:1------------7:4-----------49:32</p><p>You get the idea.  I leave it to you, dear reader,<br/>to expand the lattice further, and to calculate the<br/>cents values of the ratios in your scale.</p><p>With so many composers, performers, theorists,<br/>*and mathematicians, psychologists, therapists, etc.*,<br/>interested in tunings these days, we&apos;re bound to<br/>discover many of the sounds and feelings Schoenberg<br/>could only imagine.</p><p>One of the most exciting new ideas in music to me<br/>today is polymicrotonality - using many different<br/>tunings in the same piece.  This means that<br/>we are *not* keeping the same pattern from<br/>one key to another, but indeed hearing different<br/>keys *and* different patterns all the time.<br/>They give the opportunity to compose new<br/>patterns among their differences.  This is<br/>also exactly what Schoenberg had in mind, but he<br/>certainly *tempered* the idea in practice.</p><p>Now this is getting to the crux of the matter.</p><p>This is exactly the kind of thing Schoenberg was thinking<br/>when he decided to adhere to the 12-Eq scale and use<br/>each of its tones independently.  The overwhelming,<br/>even unimaginable, multiplicity of relationships and<br/>ambiguities in the &quot;lattice&quot; he imagined was too much<br/>to try to deal with in a practical way.</p><p>It was suggested to Schoenberg that he try the<br/>53-Eq scale, as it had such good approximations of so<br/>many &quot;important&quot; ratios.  But he did not accept it,<br/>and no wonder - he could already imagine so many uses<br/>for the ambiguity of rational implication in 12-Eq that<br/>he either didn&apos;t want the precision of 53-Eq or he<br/>didn&apos;t feel that the cumbersomely large new scale would<br/>be worth it, or both.</p><p>But today we have all kinds of new tunings at our disposal,<br/>and a harmonic theory that is becoming ever more<br/>sophisticated and precise.  I believe that Erlich&apos;s work,<br/>and particularly the latest developments by Keenan on<br/>&quot;musical complexity&quot;, are very important as they apply to<br/>the ideas I&apos;ve discussed here.  We may be leaving<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s ambiguities behind, but it&apos;s opening up a<br/>whole new world of sound for us to play in.</p><p>- Monzo</p><p>===================<br/>NOTES</p><p>[1] see Paul Erlich&apos;s &quot;Harmonic Entropy&quot; at<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/entropy.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/entropy.htm</a><br/>for an interesting new development of this idea.</p><p>[2] There is an excellent diagram of the harmonic<br/>spiral on the cover of Xenharmonikon 6, by Erv Wilson<br/>- &quot;the harmonic series expressed as a logarithmic<br/>spiral&quot;.
