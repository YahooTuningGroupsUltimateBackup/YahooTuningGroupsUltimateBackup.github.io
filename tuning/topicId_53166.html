I believe it is possible that Bach was sensitive to the<br/>possibility of having a work do double duty in the sense that a piece conceived in<br/>well temperament may also work in sixth comma meantone.  Werckmeister III does<br/>help in this regard, mirroring diatonic keys best.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I simply do not know as much about Mean tone as I do about<br/>&gt; well temperament.  So I asked...   I do agree with another post concerning<br/>&gt; Bach and organs.  I was<br/>&gt; under the impression that meantone was quite usual in organ<br/>&gt; tuning at the time.  I would be happy to know of well tempered<br/>&gt; applications.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The organ used by Bach in Arnstadt and Muhlhausen were built by a certain<br/>Wender, who insisted on using Werckmeister III tuning, according to Kuhnau, based<br/>on a rather recent Bach Archiv article.  Kuhnau likely used well temperament<br/>as well.  Organist Johann Walther of Weimar, Bach&apos;s great friend and cousin,<br/>actually studied with Werckmeister.</p><p>&gt; I applaud and support all efforts to have Bach played in tune,<br/>&gt; though I must admit what exactly that might be may still be open<br/>&gt; to some discussion.</p><p>Well, not in the sense that whatever the tuning design, one must have<br/>mastered all the nuances within the practice of Werckmeister III.  And in that sense,<br/>it is a big deal to get it right.</p><p> I happen to prefer Kirnberger (YIKES!!) as it &gt;<br/>&gt; has maximal difference in the character of the keys. (Cf.

Only from a historical perspective, Bach didn&apos;t use<br/>Kirnberger&apos;s tuning.  I am really trying to be true to Bach&apos;s practice.  We did use a<br/>metal flute for last month&apos;s Brandenburg #5.  It was lovely, though some still<br/>scream for wood.

Aaron, you seem a generalist.<br/>Is this true of Mr. Poletti?<br/>Regardless, Werckmeister tuning is at once amateurish (as it is pioneering)<br/>as it is incredibly brilliant.  It was the standard in Thuringia as a result of<br/>Organ tuners, builders, and players.  Werckmeister was quite hooked up in his<br/>day, a generation for JS Bach&apos;s, judging instruments, writing tutors, writing<br/>the script as he would for being a player, a composer, a devout Christian,<br/>etc.</p><p>but I remain more convinced by Poletti&apos;s arguments that a Sorge or Neidhardt &gt;<br/>&gt; temperament would be the more sophisticated choice.</p><p>But Sorge and Neidhardt came after Bach.  He started and continued with<br/>something else.  It seems likely that if Bach changed directions in his lifetime,<br/>everyone would hear about it.  Rather, he was set within an already existing<br/>tradition, only to master it for the gratification of generations to come.</p><p>  Werckmeister seems to &gt; have been primarily an organ temperament, because<br/>&gt; it is easily tuned from<br/>&gt; meantone and vice-versa, saving $$ when an organ was tuned, esp. one with<br/>&gt; many ranks.</p><p>I have questioned this in the past.  BTW, if it is &quot;easily tuned&quot; on the<br/>organ, imagine how easy it is on the harpsichord!  Both Bach and Werckmeister are<br/>described as being able to tune a clavier in 15 minutes flat.  And yes, a<br/>modern can do this as well (citing harpsichordist Rebecca Pechefsky, before an<br/>audience)</p><p>Our early music culture suffers a myopia: there are only 3 &gt; tunings,<br/>&gt; historically for most so-called &apos;authentic performances: Kirnberger, Werckmeister,<br/>&gt; and Valotti-Young.

The<br/>&gt; name &quot;Well Temperament&quot; or Wohl temperirt is an Andreas Werckmeister<br/>&gt; coinage. There were no other published well temperaments for organ when<br/>&gt; Bach first began to play or even to compose.</p><p>In 1706, Neidhardt published his first circulating temperament. Bach would<br/>have been 21, early on in his composing years. In fact, it&apos;s an error to say<br/>that Neidhardt was after Bach--they were both born in 1685, and Neidhardt<br/>died in 1736.  A pupil of Bach, Lorenz Mizler, is purported to have said that<br/>he considered Neidhardt the greatest master of temperament theory of the<br/>times.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Kirnberger was criticized, according to Paul Poletti, during Bach&apos;s time,<br/>&gt; &gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; having a very unsophisticated tuning, considered quite amateurish. Johnny<br/>&gt; &gt; Reinhard would make the argument for Werkmeister, which is certainly<br/>&gt; &gt; doable,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Poletti has reached my radar only with you.  Aaron, you seem a generalist.<br/>&gt; Is this true of Mr. Poletti?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what you mean by &apos;generalist&apos;...besides, if you haven&apos;t heard<br/>something, that doesn&apos;t make it invalid or low quality. Bach himself wasn&apos;t<br/>&apos;on the radar&apos; for most of the listening public 100 years after his death.<br/>There were, however, connisseurs who kept his music alive (Mozart knew of<br/>Bach through such a connisseur, Baron von Swieten...). Conlon Nancarrow<br/>wasn&apos;t on the radar, the list goes on......</p><p>&gt; Regardless, Werckmeister tuning is at once amateurish (as it is pioneering)<br/>&gt; as it is incredibly brilliant.  It was the standard in Thuringia as a<br/>&gt; result of Organ tuners, builders, and players.  Werckmeister was quite<br/>&gt; hooked up in his day, a generation for JS Bach&apos;s, judging instruments,<br/>&gt; writing tutors, writing the script as he would for being a player, a<br/>&gt; composer, a devout Christian, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but I remain more convinced by Poletti&apos;s arguments that a Sorge or<br/>&gt; Neidhardt &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament would be the more sophisticated choice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But Sorge and Neidhardt came after Bach.</p><p>I looked again, and I stand corrected-- Sorge does come after Bach, however,<br/>this is NOT true of Neidhardt, as stated above.</p><p>&gt;&gt; He started and continued with<br/>&gt; something else.  It seems likely that if Bach changed directions in his<br/>&gt; lifetime, everyone would hear about it.  Rather, he was set within an<br/>&gt; already existing tradition, only to master it for the gratification of<br/>&gt; generations to come.</p><p>This is simply unestablished speculation, and cannot stand the test of truth<br/>anymore than my statements. There are no direct quotes or evidence.</p><p>In fact, there is as much, if not more, to suggest that Werckmeister III was<br/>not Bach&apos;s standard for harpsichord in particular...even Werckmeister himself<br/>published a separate harpsichord tuning in a thouroughbass manual--the tuning<br/>is not Werck III....so if Bach was part of the Werckmeister tradition in a<br/>strict sense (hardly something that one would expect from a universalist mind<br/>like Bach&apos;s, who would have certainly known of other tuning systems besides<br/>Werckmeisters), it wouldn&apos;t be Werck III on the harpsichord.</p><p>&gt;   Werckmeister seems to &gt; have been primarily an organ temperament, because<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; it is easily tuned from<br/>&gt; &gt; meantone and vice-versa, saving $$ when an organ was tuned, esp. one with<br/>&gt; &gt; many ranks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have questioned this in the past.  BTW, if it is &quot;easily tuned&quot; on the<br/>&gt; organ, imagine how easy it is on the harpsichord!  Both Bach and<br/>&gt; Werckmeister are described as being able to tune a clavier in 15 minutes<br/>&gt; flat.  And yes, a modern can do this as well (citing harpsichordist Rebecca<br/>&gt; Pechefsky, before an audience)</p><p>The point of being easily tunable on the organ is that organ tuning is by<br/>nature a lengthlier procedure.</p><p>Neidhardt, for instance, is equally fast---it&apos;s not any harder to tune, just<br/>more subtle, as there are only 4 pure fifths in the circle.</p><p>A master like Bach could have learned both well, and been able to tune either<br/>up in short order. This proves nothing.</p><p>&gt; Our early music culture suffers a myopia: there are only 3 &gt; tunings,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; historically for most so-called &apos;authentic performances: Kirnberger,<br/>&gt; &gt; Werckmeister, and Valotti-Young. Yes 1/4 comma meantone is used in<br/>&gt; &gt; Renaissance music, too.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But like I said, most well-temperaments will work anyway, and capture<br/>&gt; &gt; most of<br/>&gt; &gt; the spirit of a Baroque work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly, except &quot;most of the spirit&quot; is a generalist comment.  I aim to<br/>&gt; capture the spirit, not most of it.  When the exact harmonic language is<br/>&gt; mastered over years, the communication of the composition enters a whole<br/>&gt; new dimension.</p><p>I meant to say &apos;the spirit&apos;, not &apos;most of the spirit&apos;. i don&apos;t know what I put<br/>that clause &apos;most of&apos; there, but I did ! ;)</p><p>But on second thought, maybe I did mean most...can any self-respecting<br/>musician claim he captured &apos;all&apos; (whatever that means) of what there is to be<br/>captured in interpreting a composition of a master?</p><p>It seems awfully  misguided to make statements regarding exactitude about<br/>music that is over 250 years old. The landscape of the authenticity movement<br/>itself is an evolving style...what else could it be? Some absolutist dogma<br/>about the absolute truth of this music? Absurd !!!! As if we could freeze its<br/>ever changing image, which itself is a product of what we are today, and how<br/>we see ourselves. Every interpretation is a mirror reflecting the values and<br/>thoughts of the interpreter, and there&apos;s more to it that simply being<br/>historically informed, important as that is. If what I&apos;m saying is NOT true,<br/>then all historically informed players have given up playing with any stamp<br/>of personality, and I don&apos;t want to hear music played without personality.<br/>Boring !!!!!!</p><p>I have faith that we would both be surprised by the way Bach himself actually<br/>played his music. We know much less than we don&apos;t know. Admit that you are<br/>guided by faith and your taste, and we agree. But &apos;exact harmonic language&apos;?<br/>What on earth could you possibly mean by that? There&apos;s a generalist<br/>statement, if I&apos;m to understand what you mean by generalist.</p><p>This is not to take away your contributions as an artist, Johnny, which are<br/>widely respected, but put them in their proper perspective: the result of<br/>your love for the music, and your dialog with it, and study of it&apos;s history.<br/>That&apos;s all we&apos;ve got as interpreters, plus, of course, and most importantly,<br/>flashes of CREATIVE insight. Every interpretation is and should be, a<br/>CREATION, not a re-creation. Boring !!!!</p><p>And these &apos;creations&apos; -- you have them in your way, I have them in my way, and<br/>others in their way. No &apos;truth&apos;, but &apos;truths&apos;....surely you agree, no? :)</p><p>Many times modern composers are excited when interpreters open doors in<br/>performance that even the composer themsleves hadn&apos;t opened. This is why I<br/>think the whole authenticity thing is (partially) dead and (partially)<br/>misguided--Bach himself is not the be all and end all interpreter of Bach&apos;s<br/>music !!!! The moment we believe that is the moment classical music dies as a<br/>living tradition, and the sorry news is that in many ways, it already has<br/>become like going to the museum. The most brilliant interpreters are not the<br/>scholars, but the people who combine scholarship with the open-ended<br/>non-uptightness of a great jazz players.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As for meantone, it is intriguing that the inventions are in meantone<br/>&gt; &gt; keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think this is largely a pedagogic decision.  It&apos;s easier for beginners to<br/>&gt; work within the limited accidentals of the &quot;meantone keys.&quot;</p><p>Yes, that makes sense, but surely Bach knew he was writing for the 15 meantone<br/>keys.</p><p>Plus, as any good teacher reminds their students, keys with many black notes<br/>are as easy as keys with many white notes--instead of remembering F# and C#<br/>as the only blacks for D major, you remember B and E as the only whites for B<br/>major...</p><p>Warmly,<br/>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=53189 href="#53189">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2004 10:28:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 4/16/04 10:31 AM, Aaron K.
