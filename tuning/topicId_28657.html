It&apos;s so wonderful to have<br/>these options.  What would be the point of having an &quot;adjustable&quot;<br/>keyboard that can play all different kinds of scales, and then write<br/>in &quot;blackjack&quot; for the rest of my life?  It doesn&apos;t make any sense!</p><p>I guess the &quot;nutty professor&quot; is really right in that respect... it&apos;s<br/>important to work with *lots* of different tunings.</p><p>Another thing that I believe our code-worded &quot;nutty professor&quot; seems<br/>to have right is the fact that certain scales lend themselves<br/>naturally to harmony and others to melody.</p><p>Blackjack is, essentially an *harmonic* scale.  Frankly, for *me*<br/>personally, it fails the *melodic* test.  Why is that?  Well, since<br/>it basically consists of only two intervals, 83 cents and 33 cents,<br/>the &quot;close ones&quot; really are &quot;inflections&quot; or &quot;extensions&quot; of the<br/>larger ones.  This tends to restrict melodic development.  I feel it<br/>slams on the brakes for long melodies... even short ones.  There&apos;s<br/>got to be a science analogy to this...  It&apos;s almost as if the larger<br/>scale steps propel a melody on to the next note, whereas<br/>these &quot;inflections&quot; *absorb* melodic energy, being, essentially<br/>similar to another pitch and holding one back...</p><p>But for *harmonies,* of course, blackjack is the champion,<br/>particularly just harmonies... and the hard work that went into the<br/>creation of this scale is revealed there.</p><p>Now I was rather amazed by 18-tET.  Has there been much discussion of<br/>this scale on this list?  Maybe before I came here a couple of years<br/>ago.  This is a *FANTASTIC* scale.  It really is almost the &quot;dark<br/>brother&quot; to blackjack.  Because the step sizes are regular, it lends<br/>itself to a nice chromatic melody in ways that blackjack does not.</p><p>It reminds me, frankly, of 19 equal.  I know somebody is going to say<br/>this seems silly, since there are no just minor thirds and such like,<br/>but really on the *overall* due to the step sizes and the general<br/>degree of dissonance it reminds me of the 19-tone scales I was<br/>working with, equal and just...</p><p>Did I say that 18-tET is a fantastic scale??  That *definitely* would<br/>be the scale I would use for a World Trade Center tribute... unless I<br/>wait until the next incident, in which case somebody *else* is going<br/>to have to do *my* memorial...  (a constant thought these days,<br/>seriously).</p><p>On a brighter note, how about the two Phi-based 72-tET subsets?  They<br/>are also fascinating.  I was particularly intrigued with the 13-tone<br/>one.  That also is a wonderful scale, but the step sizes are so much<br/>closer to our 12-tET that it doesn&apos;t seem quite as adventurous.  A<br/>mad 21-century composer with an old out-of-tune piano could possibly<br/>come up with something similar just naturally...</p><p>How about the 23-tone Phi-based...?  Well, it seemed a little hard<br/>to &quot;tame.&quot;  I don&apos;t quite know what it is about it, but I think I<br/>would have a little more trouble working with it.  I&apos;m not quite<br/>certain why that is... but I hold the option to change my opinion on<br/>this, as I get better acquainted with this scale.  This is a &quot;first<br/>impression...&quot;</p><p>Anyway, I believe I will be working with *all* these scales.  I&apos;m<br/>going to figure out a way to place the little colored blackjack<br/>stickers that I presently have on my keyboard on some kind of<br/>cardboard backing, so I can take them on and off, and replace them<br/>with a different set of stickers for different 72-tET subsets...</p><p>Like I say, *variety* seems the key in the xenharmonic world.  At<br/>least this seem the &quot;fun&quot; of it.</p><p>Now, I want to defend a practice that surely some of you will<br/>consider quite stupid.  This is the idea of playing traditional<br/>chords and patterns on the keyboard in these new scales.</p><p>Quite frankly, I believe this practice is actually defensible!  Think<br/>about it... Although it&apos;s quite arbitrary, it brings our past<br/>musicianship to the new materials.  So what if it doesn&apos;t mean<br/>anything??  Lots of things in art don&apos;t mean anything. Many things,<br/>as we know, just evolve in certain ways without, necessarily, having<br/>theortical justification.  I have no problem with that.</p><p>I just thought if you saw me banging out &quot;major triads&quot; on the 18-tET<br/>keyboard, you should know what I was doing....  :)</p><p>_________ ______ _________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/26/2001 8:00:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Blackjack is, essentially an *harmonic* scale.

Do we not play music using diatonic,<br/>pentatonic, and octatonic subsets, on our 12-tET instruments? Doesn&apos;t<br/>the piano have &quot;white keys&quot; for a reason?

I&apos;d never dream of using a 21-tone-per-octave scale as a &quot;white-<br/>key&quot; scale, as Dan puts it. What culture on the planet makes its<br/>melodies with that many notes at a time? 5 to 9 seems the most common<br/>range . . . Turkish and North African melodies, for example, stick to<br/>such subsets for a time, and then cleverly &quot;modulate&quot; to another<br/>one . . . that&apos;s my idea of microtonal music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It reminds me, frankly, of 19 equal.

Scales like blackjack are meant to be a _universe_<br/>within which one may find many wonders . . . like 12-tET, but more so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and thanks!!

I guess a guitar would be better for<br/>this approach because if you *tried* to play a familiar chord on a<br/>guitar with an unfamiliar fretting, you&apos;d at least have roughly the<br/>same *sizes* of intervals . . . rather than intervals 6 times smaller!</p><p>You know, I don&apos;t actually like *micro*tonality . . . really teensy<br/>tiny intervals . . . naah, that in itself doesn&apos;t so much for me.

Classical Indian melodic music is soem of the most<br/>subtle, sophisticated, highly evolved, essentially melodic musics on<br/>the planet. It uses microtonal melodic inflections of very small<br/>degree quite frequently, and I personally find the effect exquisitely<br/>pleasing.</p><p>For example, we can take our cues from this and construct a melodic<br/>sequence that contains a kind of ornamentation that inflects back and<br/>forth among three versions of a minor third.

But that *is* important, I believe,<br/>from<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; performance standpoint!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well then, go with it!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Actually, Paul, I believe not really.  Anything above about 20<br/>&gt; notes<br/>&gt; &gt; per octave doesn&apos;t do this for me, even if the scale steps are<br/>&gt; &gt; regular.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But anything with 20 or fewer notes per octave would work . . . and<br/>&gt; if there are more, you can play _every other note_, or _every third<br/>&gt; note_, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I find it hard even to make melodies in 31-tET...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a very easy time making melodies on my 31-tET guitar . . .<br/>&gt; diatonic, pentatonic, slendro, even microtonal segments with 77-<br/>cent<br/>&gt; steps . . . all kinds of scales can be found in 31-tET . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And, have you tried playing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;decimal&quot; scales in blackjack? These are very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; even, &quot;chromatic&quot; . . .<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That would be an interesting subset to work with but, still it&apos;s<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; *subset...* not the entire scale...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good! I&apos;d never dream of using a 21-tone-per-octave scale as a<br/>&quot;white-<br/>&gt; key&quot; scale, as Dan puts it. What culture on the planet makes its<br/>&gt; melodies with that many notes at a time? 5 to 9 seems the most<br/>common<br/>&gt; range . . . Turkish and North African melodies, for example, stick<br/>to<br/>&gt; such subsets for a time, and then cleverly &quot;modulate&quot; to another<br/>&gt; one . . . that&apos;s my idea of microtonal music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It reminds me, frankly, of 19 equal.  I know somebody is<br/>going<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; say this seems silly, since there are no just minor thirds and<br/>&gt; such<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like, but really on the *overall* due to the step sizes and the<br/>&gt; &gt; general degree of dissonance it reminds me of the 19-tone scales<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; was working with, equal and just...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The general degree of dissonance? I&apos;m not sure I can agree!<br/>What<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; about fifths, fourths, major thirds . . .<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; See, I *knew* you were going to say that!  Of course the<br/>dissonance<br/>&gt; &gt; levels are different, but I just wanted to emphasize the fact<br/>that<br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; believe that the *overall* size of the steps is *very* important<br/>in<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; scale... maybe even *more* important than the purity of some of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; sonorities!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand that, but you did say &quot;general degree of dissonance&quot;.<br/>So<br/>&gt; what did you mean by that? Surely dissonance has little to do with<br/>&gt; the sizes of the smallest scale steps . . . does it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re trying to use _every single note_ in the melodic scales,<br/>&gt; then of course that&apos;s the impression you&apos;re going to get . . . but<br/>&gt; that seems, to me, to be such a silly limitation to place on<br/>yourself<br/>&gt; when composing. Scales like blackjack are meant to be a _universe_<br/>&gt; within which one may find many wonders . . . like 12-tET, but more<br/>so.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, and thanks!!  It was a *fine* idea... and I also think it&apos;s<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; *very* good idea for me to work with different subsets of 72-<br/>tET...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not saying I&apos;m going to abandon blackjack!  I haven&apos;t even<br/>&gt; &gt; *started* with it!  However, it might not be exactly what I need<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; every project...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed. But I&apos;m wondering whether you&apos;re limiting yourself greatly<br/>in<br/>&gt; the way you&apos;re conceiving of any tuning as a &quot;white-key&quot; scale . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, it would be hard for me to argue against ear training...<br/>BUT:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What is the *first thing* that a musician do when he/she picks up<br/>&gt; an<br/>&gt; &gt; instrument, *regardless* of the tuning it&apos;s in??<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I believe the first thing is to play common patterns we&apos;ve<br/>&gt; learned.<br/>&gt; &gt; I think virtually *everybody* does this.  Don&apos;t you do that, too,<br/>&gt; &gt; when you pick up a guitar??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm . . . if I&apos;m really stiff and need to warm up . . . but I play<br/>&gt; music from my _head_, not from my fingers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not saying you wouldn&apos;t *modify* those patterns, but I&apos;m just<br/>&gt; &gt; saying that they are not necessarily, useless.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For example, in some of the scales you have recently given<br/>&gt; &gt; me, &quot;regular&quot; 12-tET triads sound interesting in 18-tET and in<br/>the<br/>&gt; 13<br/>&gt; &gt; tone Phi scale you illustrated, but *not* so interesting in the<br/>23<br/>&gt; &gt; tone Phi or, even, in the full 72-tET.

Anytime one would play anything less than 21 notes<br/>&gt; simultaneously one would get a &quot;subset&quot; of blackjack!  That doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; mean anything, though!  It still doesn&apos;t effect the *overall* sound<br/>&gt; of the scale (the &quot;sonic footprint&quot; blah blah) and it&apos;s<br/>propensities<br/>&gt; for making melodies!</p><p>Hmm . . . if you conceive of the full 21-tone set as a melodic scale,<br/>you&apos;ll end up with a very different *sound* than if you use one of<br/>the many subsets that have proved useful for melody in the past . . .</p><p>&gt; &gt; But anything with 20 or fewer notes per octave would work . . .<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; if there are more, you can play _every other note_, or _every<br/>third<br/>&gt; &gt; note_, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, sure... but I just find that certain scales are *natively*<br/>&gt; geared to fostering melody... at least for *me* anyway, and some<br/>&gt; impede.</p><p>I agree, but I don&apos;t think playing the notes of a tuning<br/>consecutively up and down is going to give you much of an idea of the<br/>kinds of melodic possibilities that the various scales in the tuning<br/>have.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Naturally, one can make melodies out of *ANY* scales.  After all,<br/>the<br/>&gt; composer Tom Johnson made an entire *opera* out of only 4 notes!<br/>&gt; Now, *that&apos;s* a *subset* for you!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I find it hard even to make melodies in 31-tET...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have a very easy time making melodies on my 31-tET guitar . . .<br/>&gt; &gt; diatonic, pentatonic, slendro, even microtonal segments with 77-<br/>&gt; cent steps . . . all kinds of scales can be found in 31-tET . . .<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I *still* would rather make melodies on a keyboard set to 18-tET or<br/>&gt; 19-tET... Maybe it&apos;s also a matter of taste and approach...<br/>&gt;<br/>Well, on a standard keyboard with all of 31-tET, many common<br/>intervals will be *unreachable* . . . so I certainly can sympathize!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Good! I&apos;d never dream of using a 21-tone-per-octave scale as<br/>&gt; a &quot;white-key&quot; scale, as Dan puts it. What culture on the planet<br/>makes<br/>&gt; its melodies with that many notes at a time? 5 to 9 seems the most<br/>&gt; common range . . . Turkish and North African melodies, for example,<br/>&gt; stick to such subsets for a time, and then cleverly &quot;modulate&quot; to<br/>&gt; another one . . . that&apos;s my idea of microtonal music.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure... we *know* you&apos;re a kind of &quot;modulatory&quot; xenharmonicist. You<br/>&gt; like to think &quot;logically&quot; in that way.  That&apos;s why you like Herman<br/>&gt; Miller so much... he&apos;s a *master* at that kind of thing...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But then another xenharmonic master Jacky Ligon hardly modulates at<br/>&gt; all... or at least not *conventionally.*<br/>&gt;<br/>Neither does Turkish or North African music &quot;modulate&quot; in the<br/>conventional Western sense. That wasn&apos;t my point. My point was that<br/>successful melodies tend to come from a patterned use of a<br/>relatively &quot;comprehensible&quot; pitch set -- not one with 21 or so<br/>distinct pitches.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you&apos;re trying to use _every single note_ in the melodic<br/>scales,<br/>&gt; &gt; then of course that&apos;s the impression you&apos;re going to get . . .<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; that seems, to me, to be such a silly limitation to place on<br/>&gt; yourself when composing. Scales like blackjack are meant to be a<br/>&gt; _universe_ within which one may find many wonders . . . like 12-<br/>tET,<br/>&gt; but more so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now wait a minute!  Where did you get the impression I was<br/>abandoning<br/>&gt; blackjack??</p><p>I didn&apos;t. On the contrary, I&apos;m seeing you using it a lot in the<br/>future, which is why I&apos;m trying to influence you to try to think<br/>about it a little differently.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You know, I don&apos;t actually like *micro*tonality . . . really<br/>teensy<br/>&gt; &gt; tiny intervals . . . naah, that in itself doesn&apos;t so much for me.<br/>&gt; As a special effect, sure, but as the basis for melody . . . my<br/>path<br/>&gt; is different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well... I think from my commentary it&apos;s clear that I agree with<br/>you!<br/>&gt; I also just like the smallest intervals for &quot;special effects.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Otherwise I like xenharmonic *melodies* as one can find in the<br/>&gt; keyboard versions of 18-tET and 19-tET!!</p><p>Well, if you&apos;re not using subsets, this is exactly what I&apos;m saying I<br/>_don&apos;t_ like.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2001 11:43:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You think he&apos;s right about JI sounding terrible?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ha... that&apos;s a funny one.
