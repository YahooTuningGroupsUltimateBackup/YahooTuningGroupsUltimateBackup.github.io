And there is always a detrimental effect<br/>on playability as the octave gets wider.</p><p>While we&apos;re discussing detrimental effects on playability, we should<br/>mention the Starr keyboard&apos;s action travel of .008&quot;, the key diameter of<br/>less than 1&quot;, the fact that there&apos;s no way to locate yourself on the<br/>keyboard without looking at it, and the fact that the hexagonal packing<br/>makes it impossible to move a finger between ranks while sounding a key.</p><p>Also, the last time I spoke with Wilson, he was very sure to say that the<br/>keyboard is based on a design of his, and that he didn&apos;t want his name<br/>associated with it until he had a chance to play it.</p><p>-C.</p></div>
