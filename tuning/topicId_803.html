It is still in low phases of development, but it is<br/>&gt;pretty operational right now.  It generates only a csound score currently,<br/>&gt;but I may add a MIDI capability.</p><p>Oh do, do!  My stars!</p><p>&gt;The website is still unofficial, so some links may not work, but if you<br/>&gt;want, you should also check out my albums.  Every one uses an alternative<br/>&gt;tuning or the another, and there is a pretty large amount of real audio<br/>&gt;files.</p><p>Nice site.  None of the instruments links were working.  Would like to<br/>hear about your various guitars and what you think of them...  Realaudio<br/>sounds good (as good, I suppose, as it can).  Was it just me, or did<br/>I download two au files in 12tET a while back...  A piano prelude and<br/>a jazz ensemble thing?</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=806 href="#806">ðŸ”—</a>Peter Blasser &#x3C;Peter.Blasser@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/1999 6:06:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl thinks that I should give my 22tet sequencer midi capabilities.
