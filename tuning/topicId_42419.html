Pehrson</p><p>all right then . . .</p><p>well, in the gentle introduction to periodicity blocks,<br/>the 12-tone scale is derived in two ways. first</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm</a></p><p>as a 1-dimensional periodicity block delimited by the pythagorean<br/>comma (=531441:524288), and then</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/intropblock2.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/intropblock2.htm</a></p><p>as a 2-dimensional periodicity block delimited by the syntonic comma<br/>(=81:80) and the diesis (=128:125). another possible pair is</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/ramospblock.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/ramospblock.htm</a></p><p>the syntonic comma (=81:80) and the schisma (=32805:32768),</p><p>and there are of course others.</p><p>starting with 12-equal, we can search for likely candidates for 1-<br/>dimensional periodicity blocks by locating the consonant intervals<br/>(=very simple ratios) that have a small error. since whatever the<br/>error is, stacking 12 just versions of the interval will result in<br/>a &apos;comma&apos; 12 times as large as this error. and indeed the only<br/>possibility is the perfect fourth/perfect fifth, with an error of 2<br/>cents, resulting from spreading the 24-cent pythagorean comma equally<br/>among 12 of them.</p><p>in 22-equal, a likely candidate is 8/22-oct., which is 1 cent off a<br/>9:7. unfortunately, 8 and 22 are not mutually prime, so you only get<br/>11-equal out of this process. the next-best-approximated simple<br/>ratio, as you can see from table 1 of my paper on 22, is 7/22 oct., 4<br/>cents off from 5:4 -- or, if you consider it consonant, 3/22 oct.,<br/>1.4 cents off from 11:10. either of these can generate a 22-tone<br/>scale, and the comma at the end of the chain will be</p><p>twenty-two 5:4s -&gt; 98.9 cents<br/>twenty-two 11:10s -&gt; 30.1 cents</p><p>so the process of tuning twenty-two consecutive 5:4s, and octave<br/>reducing, certainly does not suggest &quot;ok, this is a good place to<br/>stop, let&apos;s now distribute the comma over the intervals we&apos;ve tuned<br/>up so far&quot; -- instead, twenty-eight of them come really close to<br/>closing. meanwhile, the process of tuning twenty-two consecutive<br/>11:10s, WITHOUT ANY OTHER &quot;HELPER&quot; TONES TO AID IN SETTING THE JUST<br/>RATIO THAT MIGHT THEN SUGGEST THEMSELVES AS INCLUSIONS FOR THE<br/>TUNING, is *exceedingly difficult*, and far-fetched (why only 11:10s,<br/>and twenty-two of them, but no other intervals??) . . . but take it<br/>if you like.</p><p>by comparison, 22-tone is fairly well-motivated by tuning out a full<br/>5-limit lattice (that is, two-dimensionally), but not as well-<br/>motivated as 12-tone, which latter motivation i hope the periodicity<br/>block documents make visually clear. you only have to tune two or<br/>three 5-limit consonant intervals in each direction, and if you&apos;re<br/>not &quot;artificially&quot; avoiding any *more consonant* intervals (say<br/>perfect fifths), you have a pretty strong suggestion of closure after<br/>12 tones . . .</p><p>however, what hasn&apos;t been mentioned yet, is that tuning out a full 7-<br/>limit lattice (that is, THREE-dimensionally), motivates 22-tone quite<br/>strongly indeed. i&apos;ve done several studies of the fact on this list.<br/>quite a few years ago, i generated a huge number of periodicity<br/>blocks from fokker&apos;s list of commas (three-dimensional vectors, 7-<br/>limit), and even using the smallest (hence rather complicated to<br/>generate; &quot;long&quot; in the lattice) 12 commas or so, the most popular<br/>cardinalities were 22 and 171! later, i latticed out eight 22-tone<br/>fokker periodicity blocks based on &quot;shorter&quot; commas, as you can see<br/>here:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/messages/21834?expand=1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/messages/21834?expand=1</a></p><p>here&apos;s a translation of the unison vector triplets to ratio notation<br/>(first column is power of 3, second column is power of 5, third<br/>column is power of 7):</p><p>    -5     1     2            =           245/243<br/>    -4    -2     0            =           2048/2025<br/>    -2     0    -1            =           64/63</p><p>     3    -1    -3            =           1728/1715<br/>    -2     0    -1            =           64/63<br/>     0     2    -2            =           50/49</p><p>     3    -1    -3            =           1728/1715<br/>    -3     3     1            =           875/864<br/>    -2     0    -1            =           64/63</p><p>     3    -1    -3            =           1728/1715<br/>    -5     1     2            =           245/243<br/>     0     2    -2            =           50/49</p><p>     3    -1    -3            =           1728/1715<br/>    -5     1     2            =           245/243<br/>    -3     3     1            =           875/864</p><p>     2     2    -1            =           225/224<br/>     3    -1    -3            =           1728/1715<br/>    -2     0    -1            =           64/63</p><p>     2     2    -1            =           225/224<br/>     3    -1    -3            =           1728/1715<br/>    -3     3     1            =           875/864</p><p>     2     2    -1            =           225/224<br/>     3    -1    -3            =           1728/1715<br/>    -5     1     2            =           245/243</p><p>let&apos;s look at the sizes of these &apos;commas&apos;:</p><p>50:49 = 35.0 cents<br/>64:63 = 27.3 cents<br/>225:224 = 7.7 cents<br/>245:243 = 14.2 cents<br/>875:864 = 21.9 cents<br/>1728:1715 = 13.1 cents<br/>2048:2025 = 19.6 cents</p><p>what this means is that if you start from a single note, and start<br/>tuning consonant just intervals (ratios of 7 or below) with it, and<br/>continue tuning consonant just intervals with all the notes you&apos;ve<br/>generated so far, stopping only when an additional iteration would<br/>produce a new note separated by one of the &apos;commas&apos;
