Again, he only<br/>discusses the cases with 12, 19, 22, 31, 41, and 53 notes. But I found<br/>that his quite extensive list of &quot;bridges&quot;, taken 3 at a time, leads to<br/>many other &quot;good&quot; numbers like 27, 72, 171, and 270, as well as &quot;bad&quot;<br/>ones (as ETs they&apos;re not consistent within the 7-limit).</p></div>
