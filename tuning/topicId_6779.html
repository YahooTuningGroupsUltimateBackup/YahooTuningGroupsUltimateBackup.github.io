(I mean, Larry Austin seems like a nice guy<br/>and has written some pretty good music, but when it comes to Ives, I mean<br/>really...)</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/1999 12:39:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Joseph Pehrson:]<br/>&gt;I truly find it a &quot;real&quot; joke when Dan Sterns listened the first time<br/>to Larry Austin&apos;s version of the Ives&apos; Universe Symphony expecting to<br/>hear something in the line of Ives&apos; Fourth Symphony.

If this really is your point, I&apos;ll just say<br/>that I didn&apos;t know anything about (or of) Larry Austin when I heard<br/>that *someone* had completed Charles Ives&apos; Universe Symphony, so my<br/>expectations were very much what they were. Unrealistic? no doubt...<br/>but I&apos;m not so sure I really understand why it was such a knee<br/>slapper!</p><p>&gt;At least maestro J.
