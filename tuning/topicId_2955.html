Maybe war and aggression is<br/>&gt; a more resent trait of civilization!</p><p>OK, I&apos;ll play devil&apos;s advocate and go along with that possiblity;<br/>it&apos;s a good point.  Our written historical records only go<br/>back about 5000 years, and that&apos;s not very long considering<br/>the whole span of our history.  So what we have is only<br/>reconstructed and really unprovable hypotheses for what happened<br/>among people socially during the vast span of time prior to that.</p><p>But Dante&apos;s point was still also a good one.</p><p>&gt;[me, monz]<br/>&gt;&gt; and are<br/>&gt;&gt; situated in what brain-theorists call the &apos;reptilian brain&apos;,<br/>&gt;&gt; which is our brain stem and evolutionarily the oldest part<br/>&gt;&gt; of our nervous system.<br/>&gt;[Kraig]<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think I ever ran across this one. The lizards in my<br/>&gt; yard are awful peaceful while the gangs at the bottom of my<br/>&gt; driveway are not!</p><p>Well, I never said humans were known for *using* the most<br/>typically human parts!</p><p>Scientists have studied the different parts of the brain<br/>that are electrically active during various types of behavior<br/>and response, and have found the general outlines I&apos;ve described.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry I don&apos;t have the reference right now, but there&apos;s<br/>an excellent book about this by a scientist (I think it&apos;s called<br/>&apos;The Brain&apos; - it accompanied a PBS series), and it&apos;s referenced<br/>in Carl Sagan&apos;s _Cosmos_, which is where I first read about it.</p><p>I bet if you sat for a *really* long time and watched those<br/>lizards in your yard, they wouldn&apos;t turn out to be quite as<br/>peaceful as they seem at first.  Reptiles tend to be (usually)<br/>sluggish creatures, except when they&apos;re feeding.  And they<br/>don&apos;t look too peaceful then...</p><p>&gt;[me, monz]<br/>&gt;&gt; These tendencies are basically concerned<br/>&gt;&gt; with territoriality, aggression, and sex.<br/>&gt;[Kraig]<br/>&gt; the first two are qualities of civilization and grow<br/>&gt; proportionally with it.</p><p>Sorry to disagree here, Kraig, but no they are *not* exclusively<br/>qualities of civilization, altho they do seem to characterize it.</p><p>Aggression and territoriality are basic survival instincts of<br/>virtually every living thing, including some plants.  But they&apos;re<br/>manifest more in reptiles, birds, and land mammals than anywhere<br/>else among earthly life-forms.</p><p>(I&apos;ve just realized, if indeed I&apos;m correct, that these<br/>characteristics are notably absent among mammals living in<br/>the sea, such as whales, dolphins, and seals.)</p><p>&gt; Maybe we need to &quot;devolve&quot; to plants where there is not the<br/>&gt; survival of the fittest but that which maximizes their<br/>&gt; interrelationship with the environment  prospers!</p><p>Well, as I alluded above, plants are not entirely free of these<br/>basic evolutionary principles either.  But I strongly agree<br/>with your point.</p><p>We *definitely* need to behave this way if we are going to<br/>survive as a species on this absurdly overpopulated planet.<br/>&apos;Survival of the fittest&apos; is a concept that should have<br/>disappeared among humans by about 5 billion people ago!<br/>(at the latest, because that&apos;s not that long ago - maybe<br/>only 100 years).</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
