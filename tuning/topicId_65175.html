Chord inversion never changes the notes of the chord, only the<br/>&gt; order of notes from bottom to top. It may be a misleading or odd use<br/>&gt; of the word in a gigantically global context, but that is the way the<br/>&gt; word has been used, at least AFAIK.<br/>&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt; Jon,</p><p>There are (unfortunately) two usages of &quot;inversion&quot; in music theory. The first, harmonic use, which you mention, refers to the voicings or positions of a chord: for example &quot;root&quot; or 1st position = tonic in the basss (5/3), 2nd position = third in the bass (6/3), 3rd position = fifth in the bass (6/4).  The second, equally legitimate usage, is more associated with melodic uses, and original with answers in imitative counterpoint. Answers are distinguished between real (the intervals are inverted exactly) or tonal (the contour is generally maintained, but intervals are adjusted to accommodate the tonal environment).  Real answer becomes especially important in atonal and 12-tone contexts (where interchangeability between melodic and chordal material is also essential), but there are plenty of examples of real imitation to be heard in earlier repertoire as well: not only Partch was fond of chordal inversion at the 1/1 (To hell with it, I&apos;m going to walk! 1/1 O7 - 1/1 U7).</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2006 1:03:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Wolf &lt;djwolf@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Answers are distinguished between real (the intervals are<br/>&gt; inverted exactly) or tonal (the contour is generally maintained, but<br/>&gt; intervals are adjusted to accommodate the tonal environment).</p><p>Is the vocabulary of &quot;real&quot; and &quot;tonal&quot; common in English?
