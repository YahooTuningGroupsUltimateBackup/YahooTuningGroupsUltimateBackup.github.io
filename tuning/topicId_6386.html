He has yet to prepare a fresh version of it for<br/>the web. I sent him a note that it would be nice to have it aroudn again.</p><p>A print version by Mark McConnell and Edward Dunne was published in the<br/>MAA&apos;s Mathematics Magazine, vol 72, april, 1999.</p><p>Edward sent me a reprint of the article. It&apos;s a classic. At the conclusion<br/>he makes an argument for 41-tET. Here r some bits from the concluding part<br/>of the paper :<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>The 41 tone scale has a fairly good representation of the standard<br/>acoustically distinct notes. One would guess that if we regularly used such<br/>a scale, our ears would be trained to hear the difference between adjacent<br/>mini-steps (1/41-sts). This interval is 1200/41=29.3 cents, only a few cents<br/>more than the Pythagorean comma. We would probably come to believe that the<br/>19.9%-of-a-mini-step error in the 41-tone major third is audible and bad,<br/>just as musicians today believe the 14.7%-of-a-half-step error in he 12-tone<br/>major third is audible and bad.</p><p><a href="http://www.math.okstate.edu/~mmcconn/">http://www.math.okstate.edu/~mmcconn/</a> 41tone.html contains a BASIC program<br/>that converts a computer keyboard into a 41-tone &quot;organ&quot;.</p><p>The failure to emplay the more natural microtones of the 41-tone scale is<br/>clear &amp; compelling evidence for the need for mathematics across the<br/>curriculum, especially the need for number theory in music.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>- Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Thousands of Stores.
