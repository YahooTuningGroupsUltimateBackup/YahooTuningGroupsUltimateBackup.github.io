I&apos;d actually forgotten about this<br/>intro...</p><p>Fux (1725):</p><p>&quot;Some people will perhaps wonder why I have undertaken to write about<br/>music, there being so many works by outstanding men who have treated<br/>the subject most thoroughly and learnedly;  and more especially, why<br/>I should be doing so just at this time when music has become almost<br/>arbitrary and composers refuse to be bound by any rules and<br/>principles, detesting the very name of school and law like death<br/>itself.  To such I want to make my purpose clear.  There have<br/>certainly been many authors famous for their teaching and competence,<br/>who have left an abundance of works on the theory of music; but on<br/>the practice of writing music they have said very little, and this<br/>little is not easily understood.  Generally, they have been content<br/>to<br/>give a few examples, and never have they felt the need of inventing a<br/>simple method by which the novice can progress gradually, ascending<br/>step by step to attain mastery in this art.  I shall not be deterred<br/>by the most ardent haters of school, nor by the corruptness of the<br/>times.</p><p>&quot;Medicine is given to the sick, and not to those who are in good<br/>health.  However, my efforts do not tend -- nor do I credit myself<br/>with the strength -- to stem the course of a torrent rushing<br/>precipitously beyond its bounds.  I do not believe that I can call<br/>back composers from the unrestrained insanity of their writing to<br/>normal standards...&quot;</p><p>________ ______ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
