They have the same tuning and error. Suprapyth (2.3.5.7.11 with commas 55/54, 64/63 and 99/98) is a little less accurate, but I&apos;m not sure accuracy is why Mike is so jazzed on machine, and the 5-limit stuff of suprapyth is nice if your generator chain reaches that far. You could always use the same tuning anyway. Of course I suppose I&apos;m supposed to call all of them superpyth.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2012 9:55:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Jul 10, 2012 at 12:32 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What are the comparative merits of supra (<a href="http://2.3.7.11">2.3.7.11</a> with commas 64/63 and<br/>&gt; 99/98) and machine (<a href="http://2.9.7.11">2.9.7.11</a> with commas 64/63 and 99/98?)

Of course I suppose I&apos;m supposed to call all of them superpyth.</p><p>The big deal about machine is that machine<br/>- is extremely low complexity<br/>- has MOS&apos;s with a great melodic structure<br/>- is supported with reasonable accuracy in low-numbered EDOs like<br/>11-EDO and 17-EDO<br/>- leads to a new basis for harmony with 4:7:9:11 which neither requires 3 nor 5<br/>- is a warped diatonic scale so it lets you mess around with strange<br/>category-bending effects<br/>- doesn&apos;t have any ambiguous intervals in its albitonic MOS</p><p>All these things make it very different from scales a 12-EDO listener<br/>are used to, but still have generalized versions of the same<br/>properties we like about them. So I like it a lot.</p><p>Supra is also good. First off, you&apos;re saying &quot;you&apos;re supposed to call<br/>supra superpyth,&quot; but that&apos;s not what I was saying: you don&apos;t have to<br/>do that any more than you&apos;re &quot;supposed to&quot; call meanenneadecal<br/>meantone. I proposed that it just be looked at as a higher-limit<br/>extension of superpyth and that it be in the superpyth family.</p><p>Within that paradigm, supra here is the extension of superpyth that I<br/>probably use the most, just because it&apos;s so obvious. IMO, it&apos;s more<br/>important than the <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> extension of superpyth. I don&apos;t care about<br/>mapping 5/1 that much (although sometimes I like that, in the <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a><br/>version, the aug5 is 5/3), but it just makes no sense to me to not<br/>call the dim5 11/8. This is why I&apos;ve liked &quot;supra,&quot; and &quot;suprapyth,&quot;<br/>more than the official 2.3.5.7.11 &quot;superpyth&quot; for some time now.</p><p>That being said, they&apos;re just different. Supra is like a staple<br/>temperament that everyone should know about, like 7-limit meantone or<br/>something. It&apos;s an alternate way to intone the diatonic and chromatic<br/>scales. For people who are trying desperately to get away from the<br/>diatonic and chromatic scales, this isn&apos;t what you want, but obviously<br/>it has its uses.</p><p>But machine is notable for having lots of desirable properties and<br/>also sounding completely different. Of course, since supra contains<br/>machine, it&apos;s obviously &quot;better&quot; in the sense that supra gives you<br/>both.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
