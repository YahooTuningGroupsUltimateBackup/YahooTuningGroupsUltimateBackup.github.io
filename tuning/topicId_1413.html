What it was I have not been able to<br/>find out. BTW have you heard the story that when Robert Craft tried to have<br/>Igors &quot;greatly out of tuned&quot; piano tuned&quot; He was violently stopped by<br/>Stravinsky. Maybe it was microtonally tuned in Secret!! Also Wilson has<br/>played me extended progressions based on combination tones that after a few<br/>I could &quot;predict&quot; the next chord, showing the inner logic and its musical<br/>use!<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
