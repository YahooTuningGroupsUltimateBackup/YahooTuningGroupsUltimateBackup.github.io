Play a G# together with the Eb a fifth<br/>above: the infamous &quot;wolf&quot; fifth of 1/4-comma meantone. Dissonant, isn&apos;t<br/>it? Now add the B a major sixth below the G#. What effect does this have?<br/>I&apos;ve noticed different effects with different timbres and different<br/>octaves, from none at all to a periodic alteration of the dissonance, which<br/>modifies it to a less unpleasant slow beating.</p><p>Has anyone noticed this effect before? What seems to be happening is that<br/>the 5th partial of the B interferes with the rapid beating between the 3rd<br/>partial of the G# and the 2nd partial of the Eb to reduce it to a slower,<br/>less regular beat. How would the various theories of dissonance account for<br/>this?</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div>
