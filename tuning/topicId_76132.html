I have another great mystery of the universe question.  Why would anyone want to play or write music in more than one key when playing equal temperament?  The intervals are all the same on a chromatic scale.  It seems like you could get anything you wanted with about 20 tones.  You wouldn&acute;t have to maneuver around to find the intervals you want!  If you had an electronic instrument or a fretless instrument you could just move A 440 around to get different tones on a diatonic scale.</p><p>      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Be a better friend, newshound, and<br/>know-it-all with Yahoo!

But even with the standard tuning different keys allow you to changes keys in a song. Even the Beatles did that. and in the ol days when people wrote symphonies often with each movement in the same key, it  can get boring to our modern ears. But if you have trouble with the pentatonic, i am afraid most of the stuff on this list is going to be disappointing to you, but perhaps not.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>Daniel Bernard wrote:<br/>&gt; OK, guitar sonics went over like a lead balloon.
