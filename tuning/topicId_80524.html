I noticed a bug in the marvel accidentals in a version that may have gone online yesterday.  Sorry if anybody&apos;s puzzling over that.  It was a side-effect of some of the MIDI files switching to 72-equal:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/magic/tripod-code.zip">http://x31eq.com/magic/tripod-code.zip</a></p><p>As for Csound, it would be one way to implement tricycle notation with pitch drift.  I haven&apos;t thought about how to do it though.  You&apos;d have to remember the current positions of the feet, and the pitch drift, which would slowly tend towards zero.</p><p>Here, though, is some code for implementing fixed tripod tuning:</p><p>--------------- begin code -----------------------------</p><p>; Global variables for the tuning<br/>; TOP-RMS<br/>gi_stretch      init    1.0009   ; 1.0 for pure octaves<br/>gi_magic_gen    init    0.5107   ; 0 for 22, 1 for 19</p><p>; gi_magic_gen is (g - 7/22)/(6/19 - 7/22)<br/>; where g is the generating third as a proportion of<br/>; the stretched octave</p><p>gi_orwell_gen   init    0.0      ; 0 for 22, 1 for 31<br/>gi_tonic        init    4.03     ; base 2 log of note 0 (Hz)</p><p>        ; Tripod tuning as a rank 2 tuning<br/>        ; (Actually may support rank 3 one day!)<br/>        opcode  R2Tuning, i, ii<br/>inote, ishift   xin</p><p>ioctaves        init    int(inote)</p><p>itoes   init    frac(inote)*10 - 1<br/>iinches init    int(itoes / 3)</p><p>ioctave_size    init    gi_stretch<br/>itoe_size       init    gi_stretch*(2/22 \<br/>                                    + gi_magic_gen*2/19 - gi_magic_gen*2/22 \<br/>                                    + gi_orwell_gen*3/31- gi_orwell_gen*2/22)<br/>iinch_size      init    gi_stretch*(1/22 \<br/>                                    - gi_magic_gen/22 \<br/>                                    + gi_orwell_gen/31 - gi_orwell_gen/22)<br/>ishift_size     init    gi_stretch*(1/22 \<br/>                                    + gi_magic_gen/19 - gi_magic_gen/22 \<br/>                                    + gi_orwell_gen/31- gi_orwell_gen/22)</p><p>ipitch  =       ioctaves*ioctave_size + \<br/>                itoes  * itoe_size + \<br/>                iinches * iinch_size + \<br/>                ishift * ishift_size</p><p>        xout    cpsoct(gi_tonic + ipitch)<br/>        endop</p><p>---------------- end code ------------------------------</p><p>It&apos;s a UDO that takes the tripod nominal and the semitoe shift relative to it, and returns a frequency in Hz.  The nominals are specified in decimal form, like the usual Csound note names, so 4.1 is yan in octave 4 (whatever that is, I forget the definition and I&apos;m only using MIDI so far :-P).

But I can list them here.  The &quot;harpoon&quot; inch is 81:80.  The curved/single headed arrow inch is 49:48 or 525:512.  I think I got the right Sagittal glyphs for these.  The standard semitoe is 36:35 and it&apos;s twin, with a different symbol, is 25:24.
