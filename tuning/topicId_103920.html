It replaces the piano roll used in<br/>conventional MIDI sequencers with a two-dimensional lattice roll in<br/>order to enable the intuitive visualization and dynamic manipulation of<br/>tuning. It is compatible with the Dynamic Tonality<br/>synthsTransFormSynth, The Viking, and 2032and, for static<br/>tunings, with any synthesizer that handles channel pitch bend.<br/>The updates include:<br/>  - The lattice now shears, rather than rotates, when the tuning is<br/>changed. This looks much neaterparticularly for more &quot;extreme&quot;<br/>tunings! - The use of shear means that octaves are always vertically<br/>aligned. It also means that, in addition to vertical distance on the<br/>lattice being proportional to pitch, horizontal distance is proportional<br/>to distance along the cycle of (pseudo-) fifths. - Adjacent Predominant<br/>Seconds (APS) layouts* are now available for any MOS scale** with<br/>nineteen or fewer tones. You choose an MOS scale by selecting its number<br/>of large and small steps in the Setup window, then click on &quot;APS&quot; to<br/>display the appropriate APS note layout for that scale. - Hex now<br/>supports microtonal pitches for standard multitimbral synths. In Setup,<br/>you can select either &quot;DT&quot; (for a Dynamic Tonality synth, like 2032) or<br/>&quot;std&quot; (for a standard multitimbral synth, like the synths built into<br/>Windows and OS X, or SimpleSynth, or Virsyn Tera, etc.). In both cases,<br/>the tones are played at the correct microtonal pitches. When using a<br/>non-DT multitimbral synth, Hex uses pitch bend to get the correct<br/>microtonal pitches. - You can play the hexagons by clicking on them with<br/>a mouse (or finger, if you have a tablet). This is a great way to find<br/>the correct pitch when composing in an unfamiliar scale or tuning. -<br/>Various other small enhancements...<br/>If you want to know more about Hex and its new features, please check<br/>out the CMJ article &lt;<a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/toc/comj/36/1">http://www.mitpressjournals.org/toc/comj/36/1</a>&gt;  or<br/>the free preprint<br/>&lt;<a href="http://open.academia.edu/AndrewMilne/Papers/1002899/A_MIDI_sequencer_th\">http://open.academia.edu/AndrewMilne/Papers/1002899/A_MIDI_sequencer_th\</a><br/>at_widens_access_to_the_compositional_possibilities_of_novel_tunings&gt; .<br/>* APS layouts are isomorphic generalizations of the Wicki layout, and<br/>are applicable to any MOS scale. In an APS layout, the most common<br/>(predominant) steps (e.g., diatonic wholetones) run along rows, while<br/>the less common steps (e.g., diatonic semitones) are given by a<br/>&quot;carriage return&quot; to the next row above. To learn more about APS<br/>layouts, try the above-mentioned CMJ paper.<br/>** MOS scales (also known as well-formed) have only two steps sizes that<br/>are evenly distributed. Familiar examples are the pentatonic and<br/>diatonic scalesthe first has 2 large steps and 3 small, the second<br/>has 5 large steps and 2 smallbut there are numerous unfamiliar<br/>possibilities that may hold great musical potential.

It&apos;s built around<br/>meantone[7] and is set up so that one unit vector is a whole step,<br/>another unit vector is a diatonic half step, and the last unit vector<br/>is a chromatic half step, so that the MOS traces out a diagonal line<br/>across the keyboard. The whole thing is typically oriented so that<br/>octaves end up being on a horizontal line that&apos;s parallel to the frame<br/>of the keyboard. It&apos;s the layout on George Secor&apos;s scalatron.</p><p>I dont know at this point if that&apos;s a &quot;Bosanquet layout,&quot; or if it&apos;s<br/>just one type of Bosanquet layout, but that&apos;s the exact thing I&apos;m<br/>talking about. I want to generalize this by letting the unit vectors<br/>correspond to L, s, and c for some arbitrary MOS.</p><p>I don&apos;t care which vector corresponds to which, but to make it most<br/>useful, you should try to orient the whole thing so that it roughly<br/>follows the shape of the keyboard, or else you&apos;re going to run the<br/>scale right off the end of the layout. On an AXiS this can be hard,<br/>but that&apos;s what it is. It still usually gets you about 2 octaves of<br/>most scales for about an octave or two.</p><p>For any rotation of the scale you pick, you&apos;ll still end up with two<br/>ways to satisfy the above definition which are vertical mirror images<br/>of one another. I&apos;ve used both in different circumstances, and<br/>consider them both to be the same basic layout. Or in other words, all<br/>affine-transformed versions of this concept are equivalent in my view.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You can see the actual &quot;carriage return&quot; style break from E to F,<br/>&gt; &gt; because it doesn&apos;t just skip a line, but moves all the way over<br/>&gt; &gt; horizontally as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, so for APS the common step has to be one unit on the<br/>&gt; keyboard and the rare step has to be one unit *from the<br/>&gt; tonic*?

Checkout the Flash app<br/>I linked to above and you&apos;ll see why they&apos;re not the same.</p><p>The thing that Andy&apos;s mentioning and the thing that I&apos;m talking about<br/>are totally different. His is supposed to be a generalization of the<br/>Wicki layout, which is really economical and makes it so that you can<br/>go up the long side of the keyboard. If you rotate an AXiS so that the<br/>two arrow buttons are at the bottom, then the Wicki layout for<br/>meantone is played so that major seconds are going to your right, and<br/>the diatonic semitone is two steps to the left and one step up-left.<br/>It&apos;s very compact and gives you a ton of range on the keyboard, but at<br/>the cost of being able to easily play chromatic stuff.</p><p>The layout I&apos;m talking about, in contrast, sets scales up diagonally,<br/>as in the Flash app I linked you to, so that the whole thing traces<br/>out a rough line and that the next MOS up from it tends to cluster<br/>around it. It&apos;s not as good for something like the AXiS (I&apos;m not sure<br/>if it&apos;s possible to build an ideal keyboard arrangement around it that<br/>works with a lot of MOS&apos;s, actually), but for me, it&apos;s the magic<br/>bullet for melody, harmony, and chromaticity all in one.

If we want to just call that the &quot;diatonic Bosanquet layout,&quot;<br/>or something like that, I&apos;m cool with it, but every time I try to then<br/>talk about a &quot;porcupine Bosanquet layout&quot; or whatever, everyone gets<br/>confused.</p><p>What do people think about the term &quot;pseudo-Halberstadt layout&quot; (PHL)<br/>for the general case, where the unit vectors are L, s, and c?</p><p>Or, if &quot;Halberstadt&quot; is too loaded as referring only to the chromatic<br/>scale, then the term &quot;pseudo-accretion layout,&quot; which has been<br/>advanced as a generalization of Halberstadt. (PAL)</p><p>(Of course, to avoid confusion, you could also go with<br/>pseudo-Halberstadt/accretion layout, or PHAL, thus coining a new<br/>generation&apos;s worth of dumb inside jokes.)</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2012 12:49:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;andymilneuk&quot; &lt;ANDYMILNE@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The large and small steps are distributed with maximal evenness<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in an MOS.
