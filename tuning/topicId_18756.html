If your music uses mostly tonal<br/>collections, you probably won&apos;t run into any conflicts anyways. At least in this<br/>way the players or analysts can later have a better shot at recovering your<br/>19tet structure.</p><p>By the way, if you use a notation program like Finale, you can write the score<br/>in 19tet and then add the cent modifiers for the 12tet version just by applying<br/>them as global articulations to each appearance of a given pitch.  Or write it<br/>in 12 with modifiers and then delete them for the 19tet score.  In either way<br/>you can then provide your players with a choice of scores.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/16/2001 12:46:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;djwolf1@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/18756">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/18756</a></p><p>&gt; From: jpehrson@r...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;So basically, as I mentioned in my reply to Graham Breed, a system<br/>of 1/3 syntonic comma fifths at approximately 695 cents value each<br/>will create a 19-tone scale...
