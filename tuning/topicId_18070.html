Though I am aware of, and largely<br/>&gt;&gt;agree with, the argument that &quot;odd limit&quot; more accurately reflects the<br/>&gt;&gt;difficulty of tuning a complex dyad to JI by ear, when it comes to the<br/>&gt;&gt;actual process of assigning tunings to notes, designating a prime<br/>&gt;&gt;limit makes more sense to me.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;Well, if you look at my definition of &quot;limit&quot; in the Monzo Dictionary,<br/>&gt;I specifically state that the prime definition of limit is the one to<br/>&gt;use when describing JI tuning systems, and the odd definition is the<br/>&gt;one to use when describing consonance of isolated sonorities. Since<br/>&gt;the context of adaptively tuning pieces of music is perhaps somewhere<br/>&gt;between these two contexts, it&apos;s no wonder the terminology gets<br/>&gt;confusing . . .</p><p>Hmmm, you seem to be saying that neither term satisfies you.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;As for &quot;11/13-limit&quot;, I still think<br/>&gt;(a) you should just call it 13-limit.<br/>&gt;(b) the 4:5:6:7:9:11:13 chord might be better approximated by<br/>&gt;C-E-G-Bb-D-F#-A than by C-E-G-Bb-D-F#-A, since 11:13 is very close to<br/>&gt;3 semitones, and 7:13 is a lot closer to 11 semitones than to 10<br/>&gt;semitones.</p><p>You mean rather than with Ab/G# at the top.  Yes, that could be done,<br/>but the problem is that then there&apos;s no way to produce a normal A,C,E,G<br/>chord.  The answer to THAT problem is to combine additional tuning files<br/>into the mix, which my program does already support.</p><p>And yes, I agree that just plain &quot;13-limit&quot; probably better describes<br/>the output of this file, but it means that I need to split out a<br/>separate 11-limit file, so that there isn&apos;t a gap.  I&apos;ll do that if I<br/>can find the time.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;As for my &quot;tuning file methodology&quot;, I&apos;m still not sure if the basic<br/>&gt;&gt;process I use is clear.  Can you enlighten me?</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;I think I understand the rough idea of the process you use, though it<br/>&gt;seems highly &quot;nonlinear&quot;, if you know what I mean.</p><p>Well, tuning itself is highly &quot;nonlinear&quot;, but I think I get what you<br/>mean.  I suppose that a more &quot;linear&quot; approach would, without the aid<br/>of tuning files, look at every possible permutation of tuning from the<br/>set of notes on.  Then, of course, there&apos;d have to be a separate<br/>mechanism for otonal/utonal differentiation, one of the nice immediate<br/>side benefits of the tuning file methodology.  When/if chordal harmonic<br/>entropy becomes possible in a reasonably finite amount of computing<br/>time, there will be more options available.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;. . . Do you mean enlighten you as to my ignorance?</p><p>If you want to put it that way.  I don&apos;t want to cover ground again if<br/>it&apos;s already clear, but will be glad to if it&apos;s not.  I&apos;m actually very<br/>satisfied with the tuning file aspect of the program, since it allows<br/>for a conscious manipulation of target tuning in a way that I think<br/>would be difficult for a program that didn&apos;t use them.  It is weak, as<br/>we&apos;ve discussed, in finding the best compromise for chain-of-fifth<br/>chords, which I&apos;ve recently patched around with a late wiring in of<br/>non-self-consistent vertical springs.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Paul H.

In this case the 7:9 will be brought into tune by a<br/>combination of the 2:3 (as 6:9) spring and the 6:7 spring. In effect, 7:9<br/>will have a spring of half (or is it 1/sqrt(2)) the strength of the spring<br/>constant you&apos;re using.</p><p>A similar situation arises in the 5-limit, as we discussed, with major<br/>seventh chords. I don&apos;t think the 8:15 should get a spring of its own, while<br/>the other five intervals are within the 5-odd-limit and should get their own<br/>springs. In fact, I really like major seventh chords in 26-tET, where the<br/>five intervals within the 5-odd-limit are reasonably well in tune, while the<br/>major seventh is actually very close to 7:13 rather than 8:15! This doesn&apos;t<br/>affect the consonance of the chord, to my ears, since 8:15 was never a<br/>consonance anyway. In other words, the &quot;odd-limit of my hearing&quot; is at least<br/>5 but is definitely less than 15.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Do you understand why I&apos;m suggesting that it might be useful to allow<br/>&gt;&gt;for a case where you _don&apos;t_ directly consider deviations in the 7:9,<br/>&gt;&gt;5:9, and 4:9?</p><p>&gt;Actually, no.

Quite the contrary, in fact.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;Well, might I venture than your perception here is similar to that<br/>&gt;which always prefers 7-limit retunings over 5-limit retunings?<br/>&gt;Essentially, you&apos;re saying that you&apos;re likely to prefer 9-limit<br/>&gt;retunings over 7-limit retunings. Perhaps someone else wouldn&apos;t, for a<br/>&gt;particular piece of music.</p><p>That&apos;s plausible.</p><p>&gt;But certainly I appreciate that the modifications involved may be<br/>&gt;difficult and only have a relatively minor effect, as far as I can see<br/>&gt;right now.</p><p>Hey!  You&apos;re trying reverse psychology, aren&apos;t you? ;-&gt;</p><p>&gt;&gt;Nope.  EXCEPT that it means that two files need to be balanced against<br/>&gt;&gt;each other, which in practice is a pain.</p><p>&gt;Doesn&apos;t this happen all the time anyway in your runs?</p><p>Well, I use certain combinations of files together: typically 12-tET<br/>and one other (in 5-limit, I also have a &quot;u&quot; version specifically for<br/>half-diminished chords; in 7, I do them 5:6:7:9 so don&apos;t need a &quot;u&quot;).<br/>The file I&apos;ve been calling just11.tun is quite old now, and probably<br/>would not be well balanced in use with, say, just7.tun.</p><p>&gt;&gt;it seems silly to me to offer 7 and 13, but not 11.</p><p>&gt;Oh, so that&apos;s what you meant! Well then, let me just add to the<br/>&gt;silliness by saying you should call 7 &quot;9&quot; and offer a real 7 as well.<br/>&gt;:)</p><p>I&apos;ll take it under consideration!</p><p>&gt;&gt;I think it does.  We&apos;ve discussed virtual fundamentals and methods by<br/>&gt;&gt;which to ensure that they&apos;re consistent.  One quick way to do this is<br/>&gt;&gt;to wire a full set of self-consistent otonal vertical springs.<br/>&gt;&gt;Leaving any of them out is a direct invitation to a poorly tuned<br/>&gt;&gt;chord, I believe.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t think so. In this case the 7:9 will be brought into tune by a<br/>&gt;combination of the 2:3 (as 6:9) spring and the 6:7 spring. In effect,<br/>&gt;7:9 will have a spring of half (or is it 1/sqrt(2)) the strength of<br/>&gt;the spring constant you&apos;re using.</p><p>It&apos;s half.  But, using that measure, if the direct spring IS in place,<br/>the interval actually has stiffness 1.5, so it&apos;s more realistic to say<br/>that it&apos;s cut to 1/3 of its original stiffness.  Well, that&apos;d be for<br/>a triad; larger chords would have a smaller effective change per spring<br/>removed.  Of course, you were going to remove three springs from the<br/>4:5:6:7:9, so that&apos;d be significant: a 30% reduction in total stiffness.</p><p>&gt;A similar situation arises in the 5-limit, as we discussed, with major<br/>&gt;seventh chords. I don&apos;t think the 8:15 should get a spring of its own,<br/>&gt;while the other five intervals are within the 5-odd-limit and should<br/>&gt;get their own springs. In fact, I really like major seventh chords in<br/>&gt;26-tET, where the five intervals within the 5-odd-limit are reasonably<br/>&gt;well in tune, while the major seventh is actually very close to 7:13<br/>&gt;rather than 8:15! This doesn&apos;t affect the consonance of the chord, to<br/>&gt;my ears, since 8:15 was never a consonance anyway. In other words, the<br/>&gt;&quot;odd-limit of my hearing&quot; is at least 5 but is definitely less than 15.</p><p>I hear you.  I&apos;ll add it to my list of things to do when possible.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Oh, and on the subject of octave invariance: it is true, as you say,<br/>&gt;&gt;that I collapse everything into a set of 12 pitch classes, thus<br/>&gt;&gt;discarding information about the power of 2 in the original note.<br/>&gt;&gt;But, if I&apos;m not mistaken, you&apos;ve recommended that I NOT do this<br/>&gt;&gt;collapse.</p><p>&gt;Well, I never would have seriously suggested that, given the work<br/>&gt;involved -- imagine the tuning files!</p><p>Yes.  Natch, I knew you meant the suggestion to be used in a program<br/>with a different methodology, but the point I took was that you were<br/>saying that octaves DO matter.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Which would be consistent with even OR odd limit reckoning, yes?</p><p>&gt;You would use _integer_ limit,</p><p>That&apos;s the term I was groping for.</p><p>&gt;or better yet, _product_ limit (product of numerator times<br/>denominator).</p><p>Yow - what would THAT imply as far as intervals to be considered or<br/>ignored?

The reason I brought this up is to show you a possible case<br/>&gt;where even _you_, let alone many others, might like this way better<br/>&gt;than your original &quot;5-limit&quot; methodology.</p><p>Ahhhh, I see what you&apos;re saying.  But my original 5-limit methodology<br/>works just fine on that chord, since the template file targets D at<br/>9:8 of C.  There might possibly be other chords which have trouble, but<br/>I&apos;m not aware of what they might be.  The half-diminished chord does<br/>need the utonal tuning file, as we&apos;ve recently discussed.  There is, of<br/>course, an appealing purity to having &quot;no tuning file&quot;, but those high<br/>7th degrees, well, tell me what you think of them!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Paul H.

She&apos;s a real caboose, no?  Though I realize<br/>you&apos;re not so old, I seem to have the idea you&apos;re pushing 30.  But<br/>the hard part is getting an acoustic piano to be real-time tunable, as<br/>discussed in the last few weeks.  Are you saying you want the tuning<br/>to be chosen by a computer rather than by pedals available to the<br/>performer?  I&apos;d pick the latter as the ideal.  Or, I &quot;have a dream&quot; that<br/>a piece could be pre-tuned by the artist (following a leisure retuning<br/>chosen by a program if desired) and that in real-time a computer follows<br/>that tuning as the piece is played.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2001 10:01:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John A. deLaubenfels wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;I wish there were composers like Mozart alive today.&gt;&gt;</p><p>Hmm, how so -- i.e., &quot;like Mozart&quot; in what way exactly?</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3>Paul H.
