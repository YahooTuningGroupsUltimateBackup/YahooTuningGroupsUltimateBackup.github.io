I never was a huge fan of propriety -- the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean diatonic is improper. Anyway, you pondered where the D<br/>&gt; comes from -- I think D tends to creep in because it is both an<br/>&gt; approximate 3:2 below A and an approximate 4:3 below G (in strict JI,<br/>&gt; it can&apos;t be both simultaneously, but I don&apos;t think musical intuition<br/>&gt; is tied so strongly to strict JI -- &quot;temperament&quot; of various sorts<br/>&gt; enters the picture in as primitive a stage as this).</p><p>But JI is built into the instruments, whatever musical intuition<br/>says. For the pair of lures, there is only a 3/2 above G or a 10/7<br/>below A. The question may be put differently: Why is the D, which is<br/>only available as a ninth harmonic, used, but not the seventh?<br/>Because it is not in a 3/2 relation to anything else?<br/>(It begins to dawn on me that this was the point of your objection.<br/>But then again, very strange alphorn ditties involving all those 7<br/>and 11 ratios do exist: there&apos;s an artistic decision.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Which in turn<br/>&gt; &gt; implies that there is something in the brain that shys away from<br/>&gt; &gt; higher primes... :o)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or in the way the brain tends to construct musical systems, yes<br/>&gt; you&apos;re absolutely right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And Guido used 5-limit intonation. :O)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not sure what you&apos;re getting at . . . ??</p><p>Just testing the limits! (You would suppose that music from the<br/>Middle Ages would be 3-limit. And it is probably true, since the<br/>structure of Gregorian chant differs from the songs I would derive<br/>from the repertoire of a lure or mouth harp duet.</p><p>Thanks and good night,</p><p>klaus</p></div>
