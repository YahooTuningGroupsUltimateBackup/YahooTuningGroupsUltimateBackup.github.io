Schulter&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: &quot;High third&quot;: Peace, musicmaking, and merriment<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, there Jerry and Bob and Paul and Francois and everyone, and<br/>&gt; please let me comment briefly on this &quot;high third&quot; question from my<br/>&gt; own perspective.</p><p>Welcome to the thread, Margo. Your insights are always of value to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mainly I would like to advocate a bit of &quot;harmonic empathy&quot; theory: an<br/>&gt; assumption that people&apos;s intonational perspectives, and possibly also<br/>&gt; perceptions, might differ, and that analyzing these differences might<br/>&gt; call for a lot of patience and mutual support.</p><p>Although patience may have appeared scarce here, I think frankness has been<br/>of much value to both Bob and I. Perhaps of some surprise to bystanders, Bob<br/>and I are on a healthy wave length and have &quot;leveled&quot; with each other,<br/>mainly because we both persisted through a number of misunderstanding that<br/>got in the way of productive sharing of ideas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Curiously, I found myself reflecting on this a bit while playing<br/>&gt; around a bit with a more-or-less &quot;regal organ&quot; kind of timbre in<br/>&gt; Zarlino&apos;s 5-limit JI tuning (or actually 15 out its full 16 notes -- I<br/>&gt; had two versions of D, Bb, and F#, while Zarlino also has a second Eb).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a Renaissance setting, I find that 5:4 or 4:5:6 sounds &quot;just<br/>&gt; right,&quot; and that if I try 2:3:5 (which Zarlino himself prefers as<br/>&gt; closer to the &quot;natural order of the sonorous numbers&quot;), the pitch of<br/>&gt; the just 5:4 third does not seem to change if I remove the fifth, or<br/>&gt; both lower notes.</p><p>Thanks for weighing in on the subject. Did you listen to Paul&apos;s sound<br/>samples?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Playing this is an opportunity to renew my appreciation in action of<br/>&gt; the perfection of 16th-century music. For this music, a cadential<br/>&gt; semitone of 16:15 (~112 cents) sounds &quot;just right&quot;: the elements fit<br/>&gt; together in beautiful proportion, and some patience with the comma<br/>&gt; complications seems well rewarded. Of course, Zarlino didn&apos;t say that<br/>&gt; this kind of keyboard would be easy to play; but it&apos;s fascinating, and<br/>&gt; wonderful, to play an actual syntonic diatonic kind of keyboard<br/>&gt; instrument following Zarlino&apos;s plan, albeit with &quot;split manuals&quot; (one<br/>&gt; version of D, Bb, F# on each 12-note keyboard) rather than split keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Shift the style, and something 81:80 or 56:55 higher than a 5:4 can<br/>&gt; sound equally &quot;just right&quot; and beautiful; since I can hear versions of<br/>&gt; an interval differently depending on the context, why shouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; different people have a range of views and experiences also?</p><p>I believe Paul and others have agree that this sort of &quot;personal artistic<br/>pitch deviation&quot; is often encountered. In fact, he suggested last year that<br/>this might explain the &quot;high third.&quot;</p><p>However, responses to his jerry0 and jerry00 have raised the notion that the<br/>effect may be psychoacoustic for some musicians in regard to continual<br/>experience with JI triads. In such a case, your &quot;range of views&quot; may have to<br/>include this phenomenon.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob and Jerry, as someone known to have been excluded from my high<br/>&gt; school choir because of an inability accurately to match pitches, what<br/>&gt; I&apos;d mainly urge might be a more relaxed approach to this important<br/>&gt; question -- and anything I say might carry the caution: &quot;Such lips,<br/>&gt; such lettuce&quot; (said by a Roman of a donkey eating thistles, and quoted<br/>&gt; by Thomas Morley in 1597 in his _A Plain and Easy Introduction to<br/>&gt; Practical Music_).</p><p>I&apos;m afraid to ask for a clarification here? :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s humorous, Francois: when you suggested that the choir was singing<br/>&gt; a major sixth at around 906 cents, and I noticed this number in some<br/>&gt; of the posts, my reaction was: &quot;That&apos;s a perfect 27:16!&quot; -- or would<br/>&gt; be, if the reading with its 5-cent error margin happened to be<br/>&gt; precisely what was happening.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the group were performing 13th-14th century European music, that<br/>&gt; would be an ideal Pythagorean sixth, and quite an accomplishment --<br/>&gt; not necessarily to endorse all of the surrounding events including the<br/>&gt; pitch drift and an &quot;unhistorical&quot; type of keyboard sound, of course<br/>&gt; &lt;grin&gt; -- if it had been a synthesizer simulating the Halberstadt<br/>&gt; Organ, I&apos;d count that as more &quot;authentic.&quot;</p><p>In this regard, we concluded last year that the Pythagorean third as well as<br/>the 7:9 third was not equal to (or similar to) the high third in question<br/>here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, I should add that the Renaissance was my first great love when<br/>&gt; I took a course in music appreciation/history in high school, and that<br/>&gt; I still regard it as _one_ of the most perfect eras from my point of<br/>&gt; view.</p><p>Shared. I think Bob would join us on that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Musing a bit on this &quot;high third&quot; discussion yesterday, I read a bit<br/>&gt; of Carl Dahlhaus. What he says about the music of Monteverdi and<br/>&gt; others around 1600 is really fascinating, and maybe captures at least<br/>&gt; part of how I go about improvising in this kind of style, as well as<br/>&gt; what I hear in the music of this epoch that I play on keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One of his conclusions is that music of this kind is based on a<br/>&gt; &quot;society&quot; of hexachord degrees which are &quot;coordinate,&quot; rather than in<br/>&gt; some kind of hierarchical relationship, whether defined by the<br/>&gt; traditional modal system or the key system of the later 17th century.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The flow of 5-limit consonance, with smooth progressions and few<br/>&gt; arbitrary limitations, is one of the real charms of this music; I must<br/>&gt; admit to making the usual period compromise of meantone most of the<br/>&gt; time, but it&apos;s nice to play now and then in real JI and take that in<br/>&gt; also.</p><p>I suspect that Monteverdi&apos;s &quot;free chromaticism&quot; is what broke it open for<br/>the seventeenth century composers to develop what we now call the<br/>major/minor system, with it&apos;s &quot;dominating&quot; tritone energy. Wouldn&apos;t it be<br/>fun to drop in on that era with a good tape recording and hear what they<br/>*really* were playing and hearing?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, Gothic/neo-Gothic and Renaissance/neo-Renaissance, along<br/>&gt; with their very different approaches to concord/discord contrasts and<br/>&gt; intonational styles, has some common assumptions that may knit<br/>&gt; together these sides of my musical life.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reading Dahlhaus, and getting in touch again with both sides of this<br/>&gt; equation, makes me ask, for example, &quot;Why is it that the progression<br/>&gt; from major third to fifth can be so beautiful not only a Gothic kind<br/>&gt; of setting where it represents a resolution from instability to<br/>&gt; stability, but also in a Renaissance setting where it guides a<br/>&gt; progression between two 5-limit sonorities?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe that&apos;s a special charm of the 16th century: a kind of special<br/>&gt; musical gravitation producing an orbital freefall of sorts as thirds<br/>&gt; and sixths are moving in old and familiar patterns -- but to new<br/>&gt; sonorities also with thirds or sixths. It&apos;s a kind of &quot;5-limit jazz.&quot;</p><p>Interesting thought!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An open question: might a Renaissance style invite something at or<br/>&gt; near adaptive 5-limit JI, and 17th-19th century tonality with its<br/>&gt; higher level of dissonance and tension something with narrower<br/>&gt; cadential semitones?</p><p>An even *more* interesting thought.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe this is a bit like the old philosophical question: Is Bach<br/>&gt; played in a 31-note meantone cycle, or even say adaptive 5-limit JI,<br/>&gt; preferable to Bach in Werckmeister III say, or the Kellner tuning?</p><p>Being a singer and choral person, I guess I&apos;m jaded toward adaptive JI (but<br/>7-limit for all those luscious secondary dominants.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, Bob and Jerry, the least I can do is to appreciate the talents<br/>&gt; and effort you exert in your work with vocal ensembles.</p><p>I trust you heard Bob&apos;s sound post the other day. Wonderful work!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Music history reveals that passionate dialogues are often the source,<br/>&gt; if not the occasion, for much vital theory;</p><p>I trust you&apos;re right, Margo. At this point, I think we&apos;ve got considerable<br/>theory. What we&apos;re looking for now is some indication as to what &quot;theory&quot; is<br/>closer to reality. :-)</p><p>&gt; the recognition of this<br/>&gt; potential, even in the throes of controversy, might encourage<br/>&gt; passionate advocacy and enthusiastic friendship on all sides as the<br/>&gt; colloquies proceed.</p><p>It would appear that you are right. Thanks for the verification.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p><p>And even *more* appreciation,</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div>
