The color graph was gorgeous and I look forward to printing<br/>it out with a color printer later on.</p><p>I had tried searching for &quot;Werckmeister&quot; using Google many times and your<br/>site never came up.  It sure would have saved a bit of time.   But I think<br/>working through an idea fully gives different insights.  Anyway, I still use<br/>a pencil to compose.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>2/20/2002 2:23:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Peter,</p><p>I didn&apos;t know you made these pages as well, I&apos;ll put it<br/>in the bibliography right away.
