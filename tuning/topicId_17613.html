But recently i have<br/>been using Ultramaster 101 which while not a random player so t speak it allows for the<br/>re-tuning of drum pitches with a certain cents variable creating at once dancey droney stuff<br/>and Extended temperements for those of you that enjoy that sort of thing. But I would simply<br/>use an algo prog and run it in to a new Roland handsonic with a wack algo prog as a kicker. Or<br/>you can go backwards and have someone &quot;humanizing&quot; by playing back in controlling Csound<br/>etc.........<br/>then you would have your human quality</p><p>cheers<br/>Pat</p></div>
