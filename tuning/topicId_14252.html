In a meantone, it&apos;s a different flavor of<br/>&quot;Wolf&quot; _narrower_ than a useful fourth, for example ~462 cents in a<br/>1/4-comma tuning with pure major thirds. In a neo-Gothic tuning such<br/>as your wonderful &quot;Noble&quot; temperament, it&apos;s quite close to an 11:8 --<br/>for example, ~545 cents in your tuning.</p><p>Maybe one reason for calling these sets something other than &quot;modes&quot;<br/>is that we might sometimes perform the same late 14th-century or early<br/>15th-century European piece in different sets without changing the<br/>basic &quot;scale&quot; pattern (often defined by whole-tones and semitones),<br/>but with some changes in the color or &quot;aura&quot; (to borrow Mark Lindley&apos;s<br/>term) of the music.</p><p>In our Eb-G# set, for example, cadential or other major thirds<br/>involving sharps (specifically E-G#, D-F#, A-C#) are regular thirds<br/>(as the spelling suggests) and will have a &quot;bright&quot; and active flavor.</p><p>In our Gb-B set, however, these same intervals will be diminished<br/>fourths or &quot;schisma thirds&quot; (E-Ab, D-Gb, A-Db) very close to a pure<br/>5:4, with a flavor which might be described either as &quot;smooth&quot; or as<br/>&quot;less than fully perfected&quot; from a traditional 14th-century viewpoint<br/>-- they are not as active and cadentially efficient as the regular<br/>versions.</p><p>It&apos;s quite possible that the same piece by a composer such as<br/>Francesco Landini (1325-1397) might have been performed around 1370 in<br/>the Eb-G# set, but around 1400 or 1420 in the Gb-B set.</p><p>One interesting solution I enjoy for some early 15th-century pieces is<br/>to combine both these sets, the &quot;traditional&quot; 14th-century Eb-G# and<br/>the &quot;modern&quot; early 15th-century Gb-B, into a 15-note tuning with one<br/>keyboard in each 12-note set. This offers such choices as using E-G#<br/>for a directed cadential progression where this interval expands to<br/>the fifth D-A, but E-Ab for some prolonged noncadential sonority.</p><p>(With a 14th-century composer such as Machaut, I&apos;d generally use E-G#<br/>in both contexts.)</p><p>Anyway, the situation around 1400-1450 may illustrate how using or<br/>combining different &quot;12-note sets&quot; can indeed make a musical<br/>difference.</p><p>Note, by the way, that naming a set such as &quot;Eb-G#&quot; doesn&apos;t depend on<br/>the specifics of a regular tuning as long as that tuning stays within<br/>a certain range of parameters: it can apply to 14th-century<br/>Pythagorean, 16th-century meantone, and turn-of-the-20th/21st-century<br/>29-tET or Pepperian Phi-based tuning.</p><p>Incidentally, theorists of the early to middle 15th century give these<br/>distinctions some attention, and one way of expressing the difference<br/>is to say whether the Pythagorean minor (i.e. diatonic) semitone is<br/>played &quot;below&quot; or &quot;to the left&quot; (e.g. G-Ab-A), or &quot;above&quot; or &quot;to the<br/>right&quot; (e.g. G-G#-A).</p><p>Both Prosdocimus de Beldemandis (1413) and Ugolino of Orvieto (c. 1435<br/>or 1440?) compare these two divisions, and conclude that a 17-note<br/>tuning including both five flats (Gb-B) and five sharps (F-A#) is<br/>needed for a &quot;perfect&quot; system, which Ugolino recommends for use on a<br/>17-note keyboard by &quot;the intelligent organist.&quot;</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=14301 href="#14301">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;mtpepper@prodigy.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2000 12:11:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;If I read your examples of &quot;chromatic modes&quot; correctly, then I might<br/>&gt;call them &quot;12-note tuning sets&quot; or maybe &quot;12-note gamuts.&quot;</p><p>Why not just call them &quot;keys&quot;? :)<br/>But they&apos;re still &quot;modes&quot; in the sense of &quot;a scale played in such a way that<br/>one pitch is considered central,&quot; which is really a hazy definition because<br/>sometimes it&apos;s not clear when the &quot;central&quot; pitch changes or even if there<br/>is one at all.

When you play<br/>something in, say, Aeolian instead of Ionian (&quot;minor&quot; instead of &quot;major&quot;),<br/>it&apos;s still very recognizable and has the same melodic contour and basic<br/>harmony, but it has a different &quot;aura&quot; that (in this case) most people would<br/>say was &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;scary&quot;; a very powerful musical effect. To do this<br/>microtonally (and make it sound good) would be a great achievement.</p><p>Since I didn&apos;t get any replies answering my original question (&quot;What are<br/>their names?&quot;), I take it to mean they haven&apos;t got any, so I get to name<br/>them myself.
