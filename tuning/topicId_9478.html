I had not seen this web page before. But yes, this is the<br/>inverse problem of what I am interested in -- Fokker is approximating JI<br/>with ETs, while I&apos;d like to approximate irrational ratios with JI. It is<br/>interesting that Fokker chooses Brun&apos;s algorithm. As I recall from<br/>Mandelbaum&apos;s book, Brun&apos;s algorithm does seem closest to generalizing the<br/>Euclidean algorithm (which would get all the right Farey approximants in the<br/>dyad case) to ratios of three or more terms. . . .</p></div><h3>Paul H.

But remember,<br/>what I&apos;m looking for is not necessarily the closest approximation -- for<br/>that, the voronoi cell approach would have already been perfect. In the 1-d<br/>order 10 case, the mediant between 10/9 and 1/1 is 11/10, so an interval<br/>like 150&cent;, even though it&apos;s closer to 10/9 than to 1/1, is pulled into the<br/>field of attraction of 1/1 since it&apos;s below 11/10.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Any number<br/>ending in all 1&apos;s would have to be rational, not irrational. I was saying<br/>their continued fraction expansions end in all 1&apos;s (that is, an infinite<br/>number of 1&apos;s).
