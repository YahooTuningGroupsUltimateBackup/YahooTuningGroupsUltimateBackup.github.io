I do realise,<br/>of course, that the answer must depend in large<br/>part upon the character of the music itself, whether<br/>fast or slow in tempo, thin or dense in texture, and<br/>the instrumental timbres and style of intonational<br/>embellishments such as trills, vibratos etc; and also<br/>in small part on the sensibilities of the listener.<br/>Still, I feel there ought to be some sort of general<br/>purpose answer that will do for a particular style<br/>of music, or even for a culture.  For example, Indian<br/>music, for centuries, did not see a need for a tuning<br/>system beyond the 22 s&apos;rutis.</p><p>Against this background, we have specific styles<br/>that seem to demand the utmost precision of tuning<br/>in order to produce their special effects.  I&apos;m<br/>thinking, of course, of the kind of thing done by<br/>La Monte Young and recently by Dave Seidel.  But<br/>these are (as yet!) special cases, and the vast<br/>majority of music continues to be made using a more<br/>limited palette of pitches.</p><p>I&apos;m wondering whether, for most of us, most of the<br/>time, 24-EDO is &quot;good enough&quot;?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; 7- I belive that we can play iranian music in every systems which<br/>shows<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fifth and forth pure or near pure. ...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;That is a very interesting statement!  It suggests<br/>&gt; &gt;that you might:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;a)  recognise a piece in a Western major key in a<br/>&gt; &gt;good meantone tuning as being &quot;Iranian music&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;b) and also recognise its transposition to the<br/>&gt; &gt;relative minor key as being essentially the same<br/>&gt; &gt;piece of &quot;Iranian music&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;Would this be so?</p><p>&gt; no , I told , for example I can play iranian music in 53-edo or 144-edo<br/>or&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;or just intonation ar ados or edls &iuml;&iquest;&half;.</p><p>Is 53-EDO &quot;good enough&quot; for all the Iranian music<br/>you play?  Or do you _need_ to go to 144-EDO or<br/>higher?</p><p>&gt; By the way , I don&apos;t know how to calculate neutral thirds in for example<br/>1/6-comma meantone or better to ask how to generate system with for example<br/>53-tone in 1/4-comma meantone?</p><p>I do hope you&apos;re not asking me, tho I&apos;m sure<br/>that other list members can help with this.<br/>I&apos;ve never tried to do that kind of thing before.<br/>But I will tell you my thoughts, for what they&apos;re<br/>worth.  (Remember you&apos;re getting them for free,<br/>so that may be indicative ...)  And I&apos;m sure the<br/>mental exercise will do me good!</p><p>I think there are two questions here:</p><p>Q1.  given a tuning (1/6-comma meantone), what<br/>notes of the gamut, if any, are a neutral third<br/>apart?</p><p>Q2.  given a tuning (1/4-comma meantone), does<br/>it support a gamut of 53 distinct notes, and if<br/>it does, how do I find them?</p><p>Here are some factors I would consider in trying<br/>to answer these questions, in the order I thought<br/>of them:</p><p>a) what is your tolerance for deviation in the style<br/>of music? (expressed as a number of cents, or<br/>perhaps in terms of harmonic entropy.)</p><p>b) what is the exact interval (or set of intervals)<br/>you are trying to approximate?  Eg it could be a<br/>neutral third of, say 150 cents, or perhaps some<br/>average of just major and minor thirds 5/4 and 6/5,<br/>examples being -</p><p> . the arithmetic mean<br/>= (5/4+6/5)/2 = 49/40<br/>= 1.225<br/>or</p><p> . the geometric mean<br/>= ((5/4)*(6/5))^(1/2)<br/>~= 1.2247<br/>or</p><p> . the harmonic mean<br/>= 2/(1/(5/4)+1/(6/5)) = 2/(4/5+5/6) = 60/49<br/>~= 1.2245<br/>(For easier comparisons, of course, one would<br/>convert these ratios to cents first.  For small ratios,<br/>these three kinds of average are quite close to each<br/>other, so the simple arithmetic mean would do.)</p><p>c)  What proportion of the notes of the gamut<br/>need to be related by this interval to other<br/>notes of the gamut?</p><p>d)  Are particular scales required from this<br/>gamut, and if so, what proportion of the notes<br/>of each scale need to be related by this interval<br/>to other notes of the scale?</p><p>e)  Are octaves equivalent?</p><p>f)  How many independent non-octave generators<br/>does [or should] the tuning have?  Eg it may have<br/>a single generator of a (tempered) fifth and<br/>equivalent octaves, in which case we have a two-<br/>dimensional temperament we can plot on a lattice<br/>as, for example, Paul Erlich does in his &quot;Middle Path&quot;<br/>paper.  Or again, it may have distinct generators of<br/>a (tempered) third and a (tempered) fifth, which<br/>with octave equivalence makes it three-dimensional.<br/>Or it can be a mixed temperament, partly generated<br/>by a sequence of fifths tempered by one amount<br/>and partly by another sequence of fifths tempered<br/>by another amount.  We&apos;ve recently had some<br/>&quot;quasi-meantone&quot; tunings like that on this list and on<br/>MakeMicroMusic.</p><p>g)  Do you prefer to use notes which are the fewest<br/>possible generator intervals apart, or does the<br/>distance between notes measured in this way not<br/>matter?  (What &quot;metric&quot; are you using?)</p><p>h)  Do you want all the notes of your scale to be<br/>reached in a few steps from each other (make<br/>a &quot;compact ball&quot; of pitches on the lattice)?</p><p>If I were trying to determine a neutral third in<br/>a fixed tuning with one generator, I&apos;d simply look<br/>to see how many steps of that tuning, up or down<br/>from the tonic, brought me &quot;close enough&quot;, to the<br/>desired interval.</p><p>If the tuning had one or two generators, a<br/>spreadsheet would come in handy.  It would still<br/>be useful with more generators.</p><p>&gt; &gt;If harmony is not important, does traditional<br/>&gt; &gt;Iranian music nevertheless modulate between<br/>&gt; &gt;different modes or keys?<br/>&gt; yes , but very limmited and mainly as modal movement, some times I think<br/>that modal spaces of and in dastgahs are brother with modes by changing<br/>tonic in major and minor scales. ...</p><p>Do these modal spaces typically involve a lower<br/>and a higher tetrachord, or the lower and the<br/>higher octave?  I&apos;ve heard that often in Indian<br/>music.  The raga can proceed in the second &quot;space&quot;<br/>with the same general melodic structure, but with<br/>different melodic inflections.</p><p>&gt; ... for example fifth upper : shur in c changes to shur in g. it is<br/>interesting that intervallic structure of 2 tetrachords in scale are<br/>different so we have 2 different intervallic structure for tetrachords in<br/>dastgah.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t understand your example.<br/>Could you give a little more detail, perhaps of<br/>the sequence of notes?</p><p>&gt; &gt;One final question: in your mind, what is the<br/>&gt; &gt;biggest difference between your music and<br/>&gt; &gt;traditional music?<br/>&gt; it is based on my sense (80%)and history(20%) and that is based on<br/>others(20%) and history(80%) &lt;-;</p><p>So you are guided more by your own intuitions<br/>than history; I&apos;m sure this makes you quite an<br/>unusual person in your society.

I had thought that the spirit of<br/>&gt; the tuning was more important than &quot;the letter<br/>&gt; of the law&quot; - that is, the exact ratios or numbers<br/>&gt; of cents, and you have confirmed my belief.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That is why I have been pestering this tuning list for the past year about<br/>the importance of my senior colleague Can Akkoc&apos;s work. I&apos;m not against<br/>Yekta-Arel-Ezgi because of any spite, but because I know they are very much<br/>lacking when it comes to notating the tradition.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;From the way you described it, I don&apos;t think this<br/>&gt; quarter-tone theory upsets your way of thinking,<br/>&gt; about the &quot;spirit&quot; of Iranian tuning, very much.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A vexing question for me has always been:  Just<br/>&gt; how precise do our tuning systems need to be?<br/>&gt; Where is the cutoff between audible differences<br/>&gt; and purely theoretical hair-splitting?  I do realise,<br/>&gt; of course, that the answer must depend in large<br/>&gt; part upon the character of the music itself, whether<br/>&gt; fast or slow in tempo, thin or dense in texture, and<br/>&gt; the instrumental timbres and style of intonational<br/>&gt; embellishments such as trills, vibratos etc; and also<br/>&gt; in small part on the sensibilities of the listener.<br/>&gt; Still, I feel there ought to be some sort of general<br/>&gt; purpose answer that will do for a particular style<br/>&gt; of music, or even for a culture.  For example, Indian<br/>&gt; music, for centuries, did not see a need for a tuning<br/>&gt; system beyond the 22 s&apos;rutis.</p><p>But those are very fluid pitch-clusters or perdes. When your instrument is a<br/>Qanun or a piano, or worse, when you want things explained on paper for<br/>dummies, you need a temperament solution eventually. That is why I keep<br/>proposing my 79 MOS 159-tET model, and expect people knowledged in the<br/>Near-Eastern tradition to react.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Against this background, we have specific styles<br/>&gt; that seem to demand the utmost precision of tuning<br/>&gt; in order to produce their special effects.

It also contains<br/>&gt; 19-et, and hence supports the 19-et version of meantone tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2006 4:47:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@o...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 311 is nowhere near the beauty of 171.

But it can use it since it<br/>gives a particular value to sharp and flat symbols.</p><p>I&apos;d like to know two things:</p><p>(1) Does &quot;#&quot; always mean where 2187/2048 is mapped to, assuming the<br/>best (rounded, or standard val) value is used for the fifth?</p><p>(2) When are the nominals F-B equal to a chain of best-value fifths?</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2006 3:01:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: 31 Ocak 2006 Sal&yacute; 3:27<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: about 53-edo and intervallic structure of<br/>iranian<br/>&gt; music and ......<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@o...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Disrupting the 19-tET framework would be your 12-tone suggestion<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;below:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Funny -- I don&apos;t remember suggeting this, and either way, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; certainly not expressed in the notation I suggested.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You suggested a circular 12-tone temperament out of 152-tET, I<br/>extracted<br/>&gt; one.

I have no idea what you mean. Also, you&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; aware that Scala was notating some ETs, like 103, incorrectly,<br/>right?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I couldn&apos;t have noticed it even if it was shoved to my face at<br/>point blank<br/>&gt; range.</p><p>Then I presume the notation given my Scala above can be safely<br/>ignored for the purposes of this discussion, and has nothing to do<br/>with your requirements/conclusions?</p><p>&gt; Maybe my choice of words is haphazard.</p><p>The below continues to be a bit murky, but I&apos;ll do my best:</p><p>&gt; What I require is a system which is<br/>&gt; cyclic,</p><p>A great many generators are capable of yielding a complete circle of<br/>152 tones.</p><p>&gt; where the chain has no wolves,</p><p>Isn&apos;t that the same as &quot;cyclic&quot;?

But if you want smaller circles, 152-equal<br/>certainly has them in spades.</p><p>&gt; a 19-tET subset could be achieved on any degree,</p><p>Obviously this is the case in 152-equal, since 152 = 19*8.</p><p>&gt; etc...</p><p>More explicit conditions would help, and it wouldn&apos;t hurt if you show<br/>exactly how your proposal (with 159-equal) satisfies them.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you extract a circular 50 or so tones without disrupting the<br/>&gt; &gt; cycle of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fifths?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Again I have no idea what you mean by &quot;disrupting&quot;. Sure, I can<br/>find<br/>&gt; &gt; plenty of intervals that give you a circle of 38 or 76 notes in<br/>152-<br/>&gt; &gt; equal. So?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please provide me a system out of 152-tET that has half the number<br/>of tones<br/>&gt; and where the cycle closes without any wolf fifths.</p><p>Obviously, 76-equal does it. I&apos;m assuming you&apos;re talking specifically<br/>about a cycle of *fifths* here since you mention wolf fifths. The<br/>fifths here would be 710.5263 cents (which I like because, in<br/>conjuction with pure octaves, they work great for Superpythagorean<br/>and Pajara purposes).</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you also preserve the 19-tET subset at the same time?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 152-equal will always have eight 19-equal subsets, no matter what<br/>&gt; &gt; else you do with it. I don&apos;t know what could fail to &quot;preserve&quot;<br/>it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you preserve the 19 equal subset in my request above?</p><p>76-equal contains four different transpositions of 19-equal in it. So<br/>as best I can understand your question, 19-equal is trivially<br/>preserved.</p></div>
