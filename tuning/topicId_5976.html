Its like being able to see only in black and<br/>white, and claiming that its better than seeing colors &apos;cause colors only<br/>distract you from appreciating the linear composition of your visual field.<br/>(Come to think of it, that &gt;is&lt; why black and white photography is so cool.<br/>hmmm.) All in all, if I could I think I would have perfect pitch, not so<br/>when the radiator hisses I can say &quot;C#&quot;, but because of the increased<br/>sensitivity to musical meaning that seems to accompany the ability.  [....]</p><p>I think that both perfect and relative pitch can be useful in specific<br/>situations, the first where exact identification of a number of Hz is<br/>required, and the second where identification of the effect is appropriate.</p><p>Not having perfect pitch, I can imagine that it would be nice to have it.<br/>But since I play on instruments varying between A=392Hz and A=464Hz, I would<br/>have to learn to turn it off.</p><p>A good sense of relative pitch seems to me especially useful in experiencing<br/>the effects of harmonic changes, such as a Schubert modulation from tonic to<br/>the lowered submediant.  The effect of such a modulation is not dependent on<br/>the pitch at which the passage is played.</p><p>Analogies [?]:  sometimes it&apos;s important to hear that the strings are<br/>alternating w/ the reeds, sometimes it&apos;s important to know that the<br/>particular reed you&apos;re hearing is a clarinet and not an oboe, and sometimes<br/>you need to know whether it&apos;s the 1st or the 2nd clarinet you&apos;re hearing.</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Dale C.
