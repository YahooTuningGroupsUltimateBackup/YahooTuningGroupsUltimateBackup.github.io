How about Britten or Copland and even Stravinsky. It<br/>&gt; seens the first two might even surpass Partch in number<br/>&gt; of occurrences.</p><p>I think I&apos;ve outlined pretty well why *I* drag Schoenberg<br/>and Babbitt into this forum so often:</p><p>They both introduced, explained, and illustrated with<br/>fantastic (IMO) music, concepts of numerical manipulation<br/>which I think can be applied to JI, which is my interest.</p><p>The case of Schoenberg in particular I find absolutely<br/>fascinating.  His early development was within the late-1800s<br/>post-romantic milieu, and within just a few years (1903-1909)<br/>his musical &apos;language&apos; evolved incredibly, to the point<br/>where his monodrama &apos;Erwartung&apos; [1909] is not only &apos;atonal&apos;,<br/>but also &apos;athematic&apos;: it is intended as an almost completely<br/>spontaneous musical expression of extreme mental states,<br/>with *no* concessions to any music that ever came before,<br/>with the exceptions that it was written down in regular music<br/>notes and intended to be played by a regular orchestra.</p><p>His vision was so far-reaching, and his influence so<br/>widespread, that if had chosen to embrace a microtonal scale<br/>rather than the 12-eq, 20th-century music that followed him<br/>would have gone in a far different direction than it did.</p><p>*You* tell us more about Copland, Britten, and Stravinsky<br/>in regard to tuning, Kraig, since you brought them up.<br/>I&apos;m interested in knowing more.</p><p>Joseph L.
