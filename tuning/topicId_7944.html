In<br/>early polyphonic music the uppermost melodic line is not necessarily the most<br/>important one (_Hauptstimme_). (The same, may I add, is true for most gamelan<br/>genres and for &quot;barbershop&quot; arrangements). This leads to questions of whether<br/>the relative importance of the voices was reflected in the performance<br/>dynamics (so that the most important line was projected above the others), or<br/>if particular voicings, independent of dynamics, project particular<br/>hierachies within a polyphony, or whether audiences were (and are) just<br/>conditioned to listen to polyphonic settings in a particular hierarchy.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
