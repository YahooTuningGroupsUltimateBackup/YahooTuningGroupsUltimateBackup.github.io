As I&apos;ll suggest in a story<br/>near the end of this message, misidentification can sometimes be the<br/>ultimate compliment -- but it&apos;s nevertheless a compliment best<br/>revised, without in any way being diluted, to true recognition.</p><p>Some weeks ago, I was totally engrossed in the writings of David<br/>Keenan, especially some articles about regular tunings based on single<br/>or multiple chains of fifths. These articles have certainly made the<br/>name &quot;Keenan&quot; a household one for me, and more generally I would<br/>warmly recommend a visit to Dave Keenan&apos;s site. However, this<br/>enthralling experience was unfortunately also a precursor of my<br/>mistake, for which I apologize to you, Keenan (Pepper, not Dave) with<br/>due circumspection, however belated.</p><p>Given this focus on Dave Keenan, when I saw quite captivating articles<br/>from a &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; on this Tuning List, I jumped to the conclusion<br/>that this must be some nickname or Internet address for Dave. Yes, I<br/>had a moment of hesitation -- am I _really_ sure that this is the same<br/>person?</p><p>Unfortunately, the topics and comments in these posts somehow very<br/>much connected for me with themes I associate with Dave Keenan such as<br/>consonance/dissonance; the image of the forest, for example, really<br/>had me intrigued, as did the comment about &quot;crunchy&quot; dissonances.</p><p>&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; that is, from the viewpoint of my getting to know<br/>you, Keenan, not as someone I was mistakenly identifying with one of<br/>my favorite theorists, but in your own right, for yourself. Thanks to<br/>Paul Erlich, who has kindly informed me of this mistake, I can now<br/>continue to appreciate your creative theory and wit while becoming<br/>acquainted with the special flavor of your excellence -- and maybe<br/>appreciating Dave&apos;s, too, more clearly in the process.</p><p>Now for the story. It said that sometime around 1515 or so, the same<br/>epic when Michelangelo was painting the Sistine Chapel, the Papal<br/>choir delighted to perform a beautiful piece by Josquin des Prez,<br/>renowned as the greatest composer of the age. Interestingly, this was<br/>a view on which the Papal choir could agree with the dissenter Martin<br/>Luther, who wrote in praise of Josquin. If I recall, Luther&apos;s<br/>statement was that other musicians had to do what the notes wished,<br/>but Josquin could make them do what he wished.</p><p>However, it turned out that the composer of the piece was actually a<br/>young musician named Adrian Willaert. When they found out, the choir<br/>stopped singing the piece. In their case, the compliment of mistaking<br/>the youthful composer&apos;s work for a masterpiece of Josquin turned out<br/>not to be such a compliment after all: they were more interested in<br/>the fame and status of the composer, it would seem, than in the beauty<br/>of the music itself.</p><p>It is said that Willaert had an artful response: he composed a piece<br/>using accidentals intricate enough that the choir was unable to sing<br/>it! This piece, actually setting a Latin text about drunkenness, is<br/>often known as his &quot;chromatic duo,&quot; although the complete piece is<br/>actually a quartet. The proper intonation of this piece is an engaging<br/>puzzle -- intriguing in the 16th century or the 20th or the 21st.</p><p>The attitude of the choir didn&apos;t stop Willaert from becoming the model<br/>of his generation -- like Josquin in his age -- who would likewise be<br/>acclaimed as the perfect musical model by the theorist Gioseffo<br/>Zarlino, writing about 40 years later.</p><p>Please let me say, Keenan, that like the musicians who mistook<br/>Willaert&apos;s composition for Josquin&apos;s, I made a mistake -- but in this<br/>case, having my mistake corrected makes me all the more delighted both<br/>by your articles themselves, and by the knowledge that there are<br/>indeed _two_ brilliant and creative theorists who happen to share the<br/>name Keenan, each of which I can learn to appreciate and relish.</p><p>Thank you for your articles, which I&apos;ll read with special interest,<br/>much looking forward to some engaging dialogue.</p><p>In friendship,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
