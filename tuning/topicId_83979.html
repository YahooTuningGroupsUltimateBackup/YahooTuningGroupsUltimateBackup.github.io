I got so cross trying to<br/>&gt; &gt; write an orchestral work that it put me off microtonal music for<br/>&gt; &gt; years. I don&apos;t have the resources (skill and money) to make<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments in umpteen possible tunings.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So much software these days is geared to MIDI savvy people. I want<br/>&gt; &gt; the kind of interface that asks the following questions<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1. What notes are you going to use?<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. How would you like to notate them (complex, but see below for an<br/>&gt; &gt; easy option)<br/>&gt; &gt; 3. Are there any other notational things that are important?<br/>&gt; &gt; then:<br/>&gt; &gt; 4. Open a new score with these settings<br/>&gt; &gt; 5. Add instruments<br/>&gt; &gt; 6. write score/with playback a la Sibelius/Cubase or most sequencers<br/>&gt; &gt; 7. Print score for live performance/generate audio-file sampler.<br/>&gt; &gt; 8. Put stuff on the internet.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Even if the system was only &apos;piano-roll&apos; I would be happy. You&apos;ll<br/>&gt; &gt; notice I don&apos;t mention midi or things like that. I just don&apos;t want<br/>&gt; &gt; to think about it. That&apos;s what computer sounds systems are for. All<br/>&gt; &gt; of the playback crap should be hidden, but also transparent - i.e.<br/>&gt; &gt; if I write a chord in a part, the synth should just handle it. No<br/>&gt; &gt; crapping about with channels n stuff. Yes I might want to tell my<br/>&gt; &gt; software what &apos;sound&apos; I want associating with which line of music<br/>&gt; &gt; (and even if it changes mid-music)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Without a fundamental reconceptualisation of the pitch/channels/<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments element of MIDI, my ideal won&apos;t happen. I&apos;ve never been<br/>&gt; &gt; able to map scales to keyboards because I can&apos;t &apos;see&apos; the scale<br/>&gt; &gt; when it&apos;s been lost in translation to Halberst&auml;dt...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d really love to work on software notation of new scales. My own<br/>&gt; &gt; opinion is to devise a stave for each scale, and for non-octave<br/>&gt; &gt; scales a &apos;raster&apos;, which amounts to the same thing. But piano-roll<br/>&gt; &gt; will do. I really like the custom controller idea in Scordatura,<br/>&gt; &gt; but it&apos;s been geekified. It should ask musical questions like:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Add a &apos;key&apos; - what note do you want it to play? From the scale you<br/>&gt; &gt; just devised...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Presently, everything is just too &apos;under the hood&apos; stuff.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the real world, Ask an ordinary violinist to play a piece with<br/>&gt; &gt; microtones, and they first think you&apos;ve got a misprint symbol in<br/>&gt; &gt; the score (you have some flats printed the wrong way round, typical<br/>&gt; &gt; computer print music&apos;, I&apos;ve heard one member of an amateur<br/>&gt; &gt; orchestra say - and that&apos;s despite a description at the top of the<br/>&gt; &gt; part).

Pitches are specified as MIDI floats (i.e. 60.5 is a quartertone above middle C). See comments in this file for further details.</p><p>You can render this example directly at the command line (DOS box). Move into the directory where you saved the file.
