Lehrdahl&apos;s a pretty nice guy, but I think his choice of LE<br/>&gt; MARTEAU as a communicative failure is misplaced.</p><p>I read it differently.</p><p>The article doesn&apos;t state it quite that way; it says:</p><p>&gt; Boulez&apos;s Le Marteau sans Maitre was widely hailed as a masterpiece<br/>&gt; of postwar serialism. Yet nobody could figure out, much less hear,<br/>&gt; how the piece was serial.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard the piece several times.  I agree that I can&apos;t &quot;hear&quot; how it&apos;s serial...  (In fact, I wasn&apos;t really aware that it _was_ serial; it&apos;s been too long since I read the liner notes.)  It&apos;s a powerful piece of music, but like any piece of serialism to my ears, without analyzing a score in great detail and listening repeatedly _FOR_ the serialism whilst gazing intently at the score, it sounds like a piece of music, not like a piece of serialism.  For me, it does illustrate a huge gap between the compositional system and the cognized result.  This isn&apos;t uncommon in the arts, but there was a period of time when &quot;serious composers&quot; took their compositional systems far too seriously, and seemed to forget that music is for people to listen to, and the only people who analyze it systematically are critics and students of composition.</p><p>The same goes for microtonal music.  In general, I&apos;ve found that people can react &quot;normally&quot; to microtonal music in a genre they understand already, and may or may not actually recognize that there&apos;s something &quot;odd&quot; about it.  People don&apos;t tend to hear the complex set of workings BEHIND the music, they hear _the music_.  So one question that springs to mind is, &quot;OK, if people only hear X out of XYZ, can it be simplified, or explained more simply?&quot;  Is that related to the theory behind why audio compression (MP3) works rather well...?  Only on a larger scale?</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=15519 href="#15519">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

For me, it does illustrate a huge gap<br/>between the &gt;compositional system and the cognized result.</p><p>Hear, hear! This is exactly why I feel that serialism and much modern music<br/>theory (including Babbitt&apos;s and Balzano&apos;s) has become an intellectual world<br/>of its own, removed from music theory&apos;s normal intent, which is to analyse<br/>how music is perceived and understood.</p><p>&gt;The same goes for microtonal music.  In general, I&apos;ve found that people can<br/>react &gt;&quot;normally&quot; to microtonal music in a genre they understand already,<br/>and may or may not &gt;actually recognize that there&apos;s something &quot;odd&quot; about<br/>it.</p><p>I&apos;ve found this to be sometimes true even when the listeners are experienced<br/>musicians, listening to my 22-tET music. Even when lines employing<br/>successive 1/22-oct steps are involved -- as long as the harmonies are<br/>clear.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t bother me -- I&apos;m happy to make nice music that most people like<br/>but which no one could have composed before. Of course, I like to contrast<br/>nice stuff with more out-there, tense kinds of sounds to give the music more<br/>expressive range. But I know that one has to master the more comprehensible<br/>means of expression before one can expect to be able to constuct satisfying<br/>music of a more abstract nature. I think the best serial composers knew how<br/>to compose tonally and that is why their serial music is effective -- and<br/>not because it&apos;s serial.</p><p>&gt;So one question that springs to mind is, &quot;OK, if people only hear X out of<br/>XYZ, can it be &gt;simplified, or explained more simply?&quot;  Is that related to<br/>the theory behind why audio &gt;compression (MP3) works rather well...?  Only<br/>on a larger scale?</p><p>Maybe. For example, we pretty much cannot hear phase -- the relative phases<br/>of partials in a sound don&apos;t matter, even though changing them can make the<br/>waveform appear completely different. Actually, the BBE enhancement system<br/>works by altering the phases of partials to eliminate large peaks in the<br/>waveform, which can be trouble for audio equipment. Whether MP3 compression<br/>exploits the inaudibility of phase data, I don&apos;t know, but I wouldn&apos;t be<br/>surprised if it does . . .</p></div><h3><a id=15520 href="#15520">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/14/2000 2:20:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.
