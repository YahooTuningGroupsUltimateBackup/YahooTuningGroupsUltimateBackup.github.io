L. West deconstructed KS in &quot;Ancient Greek Music&quot; by showing<br/>that the auloi she studied the most had visibly unequal spaces between<br/>holes. On the other hand, I&apos;ve seen ethnic instruments with equal-sized,<br/>equally spaced holes. It&apos;s certainly possible that something like KS&apos;s<br/>harmoniai are to be found in non-European musics. The idea is certainly<br/>testable with current technology such as Can Akkoc&apos;s.</p><p>Aristoxenos claims that the aulos was very hard to play in tune and was<br/>bored for 3/4-tone intervals. West gives a couple of examples where this<br/>is true on extant or replica instruments. Others yield different<br/>intervals, but none obviously approximate any of her harmoniai.<br/>Unfortunately, we know next to nothing about performance techniques --<br/>auletes may have bent pitches to all sorts of scales and modes.</p><p>At least on the basis of KS&apos;s evidence, I&apos;m not convinced they were ever<br/>part of Greek music.</p><p>Anyway, whether Greek music or not, Schlesinger&apos;s scales are worth<br/>listening to and composing with, but the only one I know of who has done<br/>much with them is Warren Burt, though I imagine a lot of us have tried them.</p><p>--John</p></div>
