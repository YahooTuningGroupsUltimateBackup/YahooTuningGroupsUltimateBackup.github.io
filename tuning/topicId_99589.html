Thank you. I&apos;m glad that all of my MODMOS work didn&apos;t go<br/>completely in vain. Porcupine is one of the best and simplest<br/>xenharmonic tonal systems we have. ANY of the following will work</p><p>1) Create scales tetrachordally. The tetrachords are JI versions of<br/>the diatonic ones we&apos;re used to, BUT ALSO you get the ultra-trippy and<br/>xenharmonic 3-ED4/3 tetrachord as well<br/>2) Create a system with parallel tonal scales, akin to the natural,<br/>melodic, and harmonic minor scales, except serving a &quot;major&quot; function<br/>3) In general, take the porcupine[7] MOS and alter any note and still<br/>end up with a proper scale.</p><p>For #2, some attractive choices are</p><p>- Lssssss b4, which turns the 11/8 into a 4/3, which means the lower<br/>tetrachord is a JI 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3, and the upper is a porcupine<br/>tempered 3-ED4/3<br/>- Lssssss #7, which turns the 11/6 into a 15/8 for leading tone<br/>purposes, which means the upper tetrachord is 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 and the<br/>lower pentachord is 8:9:10:11:12<br/>- The combination of both, which is a JI major scale and is the<br/>long-lost xenharmonic bridge between porcupine and the more usual<br/>fifth-based harmony<br/>- Lssssss b7, which turns the 11/6 into a 7/4, giving you an almost otonality<br/>- sssLsss #2, which is a symmetric &quot;Dorian&quot; scale - with the 10/9 over<br/>the root transformed into 9/8 in order to otonally strengthen it. USE<br/>THIS A LOT</p><p>etc. And I will scream this from the top of the highest mountain until<br/>people catch on! More realistically, I will write a piece of music to<br/>demo its capabilities, eventually, but as you remember, I&apos;m not hear,<br/>so I can&apos;t. Either way, thanks for keeping the dream alive. I think<br/>this is important enough to warrant a xenwiki page about it, or maybe<br/>an addition to the porcupine family page.</p><p>We also need to delve into the MODMOS&apos;s of miracle and orwell, which<br/>will probably melt faces off all across the globe, but I just have no<br/>time now... will have to put it on my backlog of stuff I&apos;ve said I&apos;m<br/>going to do.</p><p>&gt; In the age of electronics we can produce any tuning we wish, which reduces the attractiveness of low-complexity temperaments.</p><p>Except where comma pumps are concerned, which you seemed to agree<br/>before were of pretty important and fundamental concern. Consider that<br/>in 12-tet, the root fits otonally on top of the IV chord, but then the<br/>IV sits as a very rough 7-limit ratio on top of the V chord, which<br/>sits on top of the I chord. And then, on top of that, you have the<br/>81/80 comma pump that lets you run in circles endlessly while flirting<br/>with all of this. Humans seem to like such endless running in circles.</p><p>More importantly, if we could find low-complexity temperaments that<br/>have similar setups, where going utonally from the root can land you<br/>otonally above another note that&apos;s otonal from the root, that might<br/>lead to some magical possibilities.
