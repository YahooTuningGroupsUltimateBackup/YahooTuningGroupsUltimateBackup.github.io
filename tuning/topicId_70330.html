Existing designs are limited by the built-in<br/>number of keys and those depression surfaces that are emancipated from them<br/>are impossible to correctly tune on-the-fly.</p><p>This is why, I would like to bring to your attention the pressing need to<br/>innovate a microtonal interface accomodating any kind of keyboard<br/>configuration as the user may desire.</p><p>If I may be so bold as to suggest what is in my mind:</p><p>1. A portable rollable display such as the one seen in<br/><a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/philips-shows-rollable-display-123512.php">http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/philips-shows-rollable-display-123512.php</a><br/>but specifically manufactured to match the breadth of an ordinary 4-octave<br/>electronic keyboard,</p><p>2. A multi-touch and pressure sensor layer that accompanies the display for<br/>velocity-sensitive polyphony,</p><p>3. Integration with Manuel op de Coul&apos;s SCALA Chromatic Clavier<br/>(<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/</a>) and similar interactive software for<br/>various microtonal display arrangements,</p><p>4. Audio/Midi Controller functions such as those in Ozonic at<br/><a href="http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Ozonic-main.html">http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Ozonic-main.html</a>.</p><p>I hope to have aroused your interest in the development of such a device.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan Yarman<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p></div>
