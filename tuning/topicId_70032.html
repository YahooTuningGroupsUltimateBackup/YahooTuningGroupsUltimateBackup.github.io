For example, there are exact symbols for 7-limit<br/>alterations such as 16384:16875 and 625:648 (each containing 5^4),<br/>3072:3125 (containing 5^5), 864:875 (containing 5^3*7), 1024:1029 and<br/>1715:1728 (each containing 7^3), 64827:65536 and 19208:19683 (each<br/>containing 7^4), 243:245 (containing 5*7^2), and 32768:33075<br/>(containing 5^2*7^2).</p><p>As I&apos;m sure you&apos;re well aware, how one ultimately decides to go about<br/>notating microtonal accidentals involves certain trade-offs: more<br/>symbols (or combinations thereof) allow more commas to be notated<br/>exactly (or greater precision, when they must be approximated) for<br/>theoretical or electronic-music applications, but this can become so<br/>complicated that it&apos;s virtually impossible to read on a manuscript in<br/>a real-time performance.</p><p>Dave Keenan &amp; I intended Sagittal to be a notation that would be<br/>equally well suited to both theory and performance, and as we began<br/>to ponder the problem of notating comma-accidentals containing<br/>multiple primes &gt;3, we rejected the idea of using multiple Sagittal<br/>accidentals, because it becomes very difficult to judge the aggregate<br/>size of an alteration, particularly when the symbols alter in<br/>opposite directions.  For example, notating something as simple as a<br/>5:6:7 chord on C would result in Gbt/ for the top note (in Sagittal<br/>shorthand), where b = apotome down (flat), / = /| 80:81 up, and t<br/>= !) 63:64 down.  Instead, we decided to create a separate symbol |(<br/>for the difference between 63:64 and 81:80, i.e., the 5:7 kleisma<br/>(5103:5120), so that 7/5 could be notated more simply as Gbc or Gb!( .</p><p>In the process, we found that the 17-kleisma (2176:2187) and 17-comma<br/>(4096:4131) differed by almost exactly a 5:7 kleisma (&lt;0.25 cents<br/>difference), so we took advantage of that fact by using the<br/>combination of flags for the 17-kleisma ~| and 5:7 kleisma |( in the<br/>17-comma ~|( symbol (which is defined exactly as 17C, and not as<br/>the &quot;sum&quot; of 5:7k and 17k).  So you can easily judge the resultant<br/>size of the symbol alteration by its component flags (which never<br/>alter in opposite directions).</p><p>Likewise, we also created symbols --  /|\  (|)  (|(  (|  )|(  --<br/>that notate all of the 11-limit consonances exactly, as well as other<br/>symbols -- //|  /|)  (|\  -- that notate 5^2 and 5*7 exactly.  These<br/>are all members of the athenian-level (medium-precision) JI set.</p><p>After that, we addressed the problem of notating the more complex<br/>combinations of primes that would occur in more distant modulations<br/>by means of: 1) additional symbol cores (i.e., flag combinations) and<br/>2) the addition of accent marks added to the left and/or right side<br/>of a symbol core.  Thus, the symbol core (|\, with various accent-<br/>marks added, represents the following dieses exactly:</p><p>.(|\   7L, 27:28<br/>(|\.   125L, 51200:531441<br/>(|\    35L, 8192:8505<br/>(|\&apos;   13L, 26:27<br/>&apos;(|\.  5:77L, 77:80<br/>&apos;(|\   175L, 2^28:3^13*5^2*7</p><p>There are also 2 or 3 other (more complicated) possibilities that I<br/>haven&apos;t listed, simply because they haven&apos;t been finalized.  (As I<br/>write this, we&apos;re still working on some of the more esoteric symbol<br/>definitions.)  Observe that 125L and 13L differ from 35L by ~0.4<br/>cents.</p><p>In a real-time performance at a fast tempo, a player will probably<br/>choose to disregard the accent marks (and, assuming perfect<br/>technique, will still come within 2 cents of the intended pitch).  At<br/>a slower tempo the left-accent marks (amounting to ~2 cents) may be<br/>observed and fine-tuned by ear, while most right-accent marks will<br/>probably be disregarded.  In a theory text or an electronic music<br/>application the accent marks will allow these fine distinctions to be<br/>made.</p><p>I realize that the prime-number content of complex commas won&apos;t be<br/>readily apparent in most of these accented symbols, but OTOH the size<br/>alteration definitely will be (which may lead to some ideas for<br/>harmonic bridging).  If you work with these symbols over an extended<br/>period of time, you&apos;ll memorize the ones you use most -- in the above<br/>table, I already knew the prime content of the first four dieses off<br/>the top of my head.</p><p>If your modulations are so extensive that you run out of symbols,<br/>then would there be any problem with approximations that are<br/>typically 0.2 cents or a maximum of 0.4 cents?

If you&apos;re working at the 7 limit, for example, then<br/>it would be possible to expand the use of &quot;smart defaults&quot; (i.e., the<br/>ability to associate the same symbol with different commas, depending<br/>on the context) to various prime limits, so that an 11M-diesis<br/>(32:33) symbol, for example, would instead be interpreted as a 49M-<br/>diesis (4969:4096).</p><p>Another (perhaps better) possibility would be to make substitutions<br/>in the medium-precision (athenian) symbol set for 7-limit JI so that<br/>7-limit symbols are maximized.

Sagittal basically gives you a set of symbols for commas (whether tempered or not). It is the most extensive, logical and beautiful such set ever devised -- this is the symbolisation.

This is perfectly reasonable, even in Pythagorean tuning people rarely modulate so far as to need more. But if they do, they are free to choose whether to simply stack up more sharps or flats, or whether to notice that after 29 or 41 or 53 or 306 (or whatever) modulations they are back very close to their starting point and might as well start reusing shorter notations. The same goes for sagittal, but this time with comma symbols and higher prime limits.</p><p>You are free to stack up multiple sagittals if that&apos;s what you really want to do. There are no Sagittal police. :-) But we strongly discourage it as it will quickly become unreadable and we suspect that people are often not aware of all the alternatives (although clearly you are aware of some, with mention of 31-edo and 441-edo). Which is why George said it is a &quot;no no&quot;. And I suppose we worry that the sight of long strings of Sagittals against a single note might give people the wrong idea about Sagittal and hinder its acceptance.</p><p>There are situations where it does not need to be readable in real time, e.g. for purposes of theoretical explanation or analysis or indeed composition. And it certainly can make sense to use two sagittals in cases where the first can be considered to be tightly bound to the nominal, conceptually a compound nominal, due to modulation. But we would very strongly discourage more than two sagittals per note.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m more inclined, were I to use acoustic<br/>&gt;players, to notate in extended meantone with standard accidentals<br/>&gt;(31-eq), and just instruct them to do adaptive JI on the fifths etc.</p><p>31-edo with adaptive JI is a perfectly fine way to do it. That&apos;s the semantic level. Now why not use the Sagittal symbols for 31-edo. The only difference from conventional is that we can choose to use semi-sharp/flat symbols /|\  \!/ instead of double sharps or flats whenever it would make more sense. That&apos;s the symbolisation level.<br/>C C^  C# Db Dv D<br/>versus<br/>C Dbb C# Db Cx D</p><p>&gt;Of course, one would still have difficulties with notation if one were<br/>&gt;using commas as melodic intervals, though. And still, one could argue,<br/>&gt;as you have, that acoustic situations are going to be typically at or<br/>&gt;greater than 2 errors anyway.....</p><p>As George mentioned, 0.2 cent errors will be the ultimate limit of Sagittal, not 2 cent errors. But the 2 cent level -- Athenian -- should be adequate for most purposes, being effectively an unequal division of the apotome into 21 parts.</p><p>The higher precision levels have not yet been published as they have not been finalised and any input such as yours is very welcome. George and I discuss the details almost daily (with occasional gaps of a month or two). We&apos;ve been going at it for years now. Maybe it&apos;s time to lay out the remaining problems for wider discussion on tuning-math again -- after we&apos;ve published Sagittal 2 and its character map.</p><p>&gt;That said, I appreciate the work you and Dave have done to give the<br/>&gt;world Sagittal--it sure looks cool, and it&apos;s very complete. My one<br/>&gt;critique would be it&apos;s inelegance (meaning the literal sense--lacking<br/>&gt;simplicity--it&apos;s a lot of symbols to memorize, and it gets bloated<br/>&gt;fast---a lot to ask of players who would be fish out of water to begin<br/>&gt;with), but that reflects the real-world situation of any JI endeavor<br/>&gt;that would &apos;leave Kansas&apos; ;) --- but we should remember that there are<br/>&gt;very few reasons to modulate far in JI, anyway....</p><p>Yes there are a lot of symbols for completeness. But some of those symbols are there to fill a need that occurs maybe once in the entire Scala scale archive of over 2000 scales (20,000 pitches). You can forget about them. Unfortunately they still take up one slot in the font, and one slot in any table of symbols, which makes them look like they are just as important. We have tried to address this in the new character map by making the less important symbols smaller. If they were really made proportional to their popularity you wouldn&apos;t see them at all, but we&apos;ll use some kind of log scale.</p><p>It&apos;s entirely your choice as to how many symbols to actually use, e.g. at what point to rely on approximations. But there is yet another alternative that does _not_ rely on approximations.</p><p>Smart defaults<br/>--------------<br/>You may not be aware that in the sagittal notation of JI it is perfectly acceptable to define the same symbol as having a different comma meaning depending on which nominal and sharps or flats it occurs with, provided all such commas are within the &quot;capture zone&quot; of the symbol. This enormously increases the number of JI pitches notatable _exactly_ with only the 12 symbol pairs of Athenian. See<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/whatpitch.txt">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/whatpitch.txt</a></p><p>And since you&apos;re only doing 7-limit, you could do the same thing using only the 3 symbol pairs of the 72-edo symbol set. You can then provide a table or staff showing what each combination of nominal, sharps or flats and sagittal means as a ratio, to accompany your score. The player will probably still just use adaptive JI, but with this method she doesn&apos;t have to. You would not be notating 72-edo, it would be strict JI, but using the same symbol set as 72-edo for a (possibly unequal) division of the apotome into 6 parts.</p><p>I would be very keen to know whether this works for you.

If you want the single-ASCII-character form for the<br/>7-comma symbol it is &quot;t&quot; for down and &quot;f&quot; for up.

That&apos;s my main consideration.<br/>&gt; Of course, you address the smart default option, which is promising,<br/>&gt; below.</p><p>&gt; Yes, and I think microabc/abc, unfortunately doesn&apos;t allow a modular<br/>&gt; approach to stacking accidentals.

It just seems a<br/>&gt; typical JI fundamentalist (which I am *not*) would want unlimited<br/>&gt; precision of expression.

Once they are convinced of that there<br/>are really only two contenders and they don&apos;t really compete with each<br/>other, in fact they can be used simultaneously.
