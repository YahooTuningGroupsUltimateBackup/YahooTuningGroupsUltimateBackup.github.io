But I have to express an opinon that&apos;s totally<br/>contrary to yours on this one (of course, we&apos;ve been here before,<br/>so I&apos;ll keep it as brief as I can).  This is a case where we agree<br/>to disagree.   :)</p><p>Just as jazz musicians see no harm in taking any tune and changing<br/>it any degree up to and including beyond recognition, I see no<br/>reason why no composer&apos;s music can&apos;t be used in a retuning<br/>experiment.</p><p>I will qualify my opinion with the restriction that it should<br/>be clearly labelled as a retuning experiment by the person doing<br/>the retuning.  Keep in mind that _a capella_ vocal ensembles<br/>and unaccompanied string-quartets routinely perform music<br/>nominally written in 12-tET in a quasi-JI without labelling.</p><p>In the particular case of Schoenberg, my opinion is certainly<br/>harder to defend, because he spent hours coaching his string<br/>quartet (the Kolisch Quartet) to match their intonation to a<br/>strctly-12-tET piano, and his letters clearly state the need<br/>for trained musicians playing his music to restrain their<br/>tendency to tune intervals &apos;purely&apos; (nature) but rather instead<br/>make them 12-tET (art).</p><p>But the evidence for these beliefs and actions appears rather<br/>late in Schoenberg&apos;s life (from his 50s on), and his entire<br/>early practical musical experience was as a string player<br/>playing chamber music, which, in tandem with his apparently<br/>phenomenal sense of hearing and pitch (just like Partch),<br/>argues (IMO) that he would have envisioned harmony in JI terms<br/>in his early composing career, say 1890-1904 or so.  It&apos;s<br/>important to remember that except for lessons with Zemlinsky,<br/>Schoenberg prided himself on being entirely self-taught.</p><p>I see 1905 as the crucial year when the Viennese and Parisian<br/>composers, and Ives in New York, all began to envision a harmony<br/>that worked on the same principles as the old tonal harmony,<br/>but without a feeling of key-center.  This would be the moment<br/>when the 12-tET scale comes into its own as a distinctive<br/>harmonic basis, as Schoenberg wrote about it in his _Harmonielehre_<br/>in 1910-11.</p><p>Anyway, now I&apos;m rambling on longer than I wanted.
