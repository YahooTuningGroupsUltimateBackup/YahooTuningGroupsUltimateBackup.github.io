Even<br/>the tonic was sharp, and the subdominant even more so, perhaps as<br/>much as a quarter-tone!  Fascinating...</p><p>Then last night I got to Austin TX, where I got a chance to meet<br/>and talk with Chris Chapman (on whose computer I am now typing)<br/>and, today, Gary Morrison.  Unfortunately I had hoped to meet<br/>John Loffink, but just missed him.</p><p>That&apos;s just about it for visits to microtonalists, until I get<br/>to San Diego in a few more days...</p><p>-monz (on road trip 2000)</p><p>PS - Hey Dave, Chris thinks the T-shirts are a great idea!</p><p>______________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free Email at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div>
