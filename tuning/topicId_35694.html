I reported this<br/>phenominon earlier.  I hope it&apos;s nothing wrong with my hearing or<br/>ability to discern pitch as a composer.  Otherwise, I will have to<br/>move to a *much* more aleatoric style... hmmm.</p><p>The problem is, with the new jerries examples I&apos;m not hearing<br/>the &quot;fundamental&quot; very well.  Anybody else (of the two other people<br/>who are trying this) experiencing this phenominon.</p><p>What I get sounds like, instead of a perfect fifth opening, something<br/>that sounds more like a minor third... the 5:6 of the 4:5:6.  I&apos;m not<br/>getting the &quot;4.&quot;</p><p>Of course, there really is *no* third in there, but because I can&apos;t<br/>hear the fundamental I seem to want to supply one.  It&apos;s a curious<br/>situation.  Could it have something to do with some problems I am<br/>having with the timbres?</p><p>So I hear what sounds like a 5:6 and *then* the 5 transposed up<br/>another octave, becoming a 10, I guess.  So the 5:6 becomes a major<br/>sixth at 6:10 or 3:5.</p><p>Then the &quot;6&quot; drops out, and I&apos;m left with the 10...</p><p>But it&apos;s hard to judge it all in these samples without hearing the<br/>fundamental clearly.</p><p>What&apos;s going on here?  I didn&apos;t seem to have a problem when the<br/>triads were played as simultaneities in the first round of jerries...</p><p>Anybody *else* having trouble hearing the fundamentals??</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
