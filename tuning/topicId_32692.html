Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2002 1:50:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and I&apos;d like to say a bit more about George<br/>Secor&apos;s most impressive 72-EDO notation, and about some of the issues<br/>regarding &quot;standards&quot; in our community.</p><p>First, George, I&apos;d like not only to affirm everything that you&apos;ve<br/>quoted from my letters, but to add that I consider your saggital<br/>system one of the most ingenious and artful innovations in musical<br/>notation over the last 450 years at least.</p><p>Since &quot;implementation is the best flattery,&quot; to borrow a computer-age<br/>variant of a time-honored adage, I would like happily to announce my<br/>own policy. So far, I have not used any 72-EDO notation on this group,<br/>because I have not been involved with 72-EDO; for 24-of-36-EDO, I have<br/>used a simple notation with a single extra symbol to show the raising<br/>of a note by a 1/6-tone. Thus so far I have been &quot;neutral&quot; in the<br/>72-EDO notation debate.</p><p>What I would like to do at any appropriate point is to learn and use<br/>your ASCII equivalents of the saggital notation in this forum as my<br/>72-EDO notation of choice, both to demonstrate it, and to discuss some<br/>practical issues regarding the &quot;translation&quot; of music originally<br/>conceived in neo-medieval styles and tuning systems into 72-EDO.</p><p>Of course, as my quoted remarks should suggest, this notation very<br/>beautifully builds on tradition -- from Tartini/Cooper to Bosanquet --<br/>while achieving a unified and attractive visual appearance which &quot;puts<br/>it all together.&quot; An ASCII representation can only suggest part of<br/>this overall beauty, but it is in its own way a very practical<br/>solution for text-based dialogue in a forum like this one.</p><p>Please, Joe Pehrson, let me respond very respectfully to the issues<br/>you raise. First, I must admit that I am something of a creature of<br/>tradition myself, at least if the tradition doesn&apos;t conflict with my<br/>musical intent. Thus my 31-(N)EDO notation for a meantone cycle is<br/>mostly based on Vicentino&apos;s of 1555: it&apos;s simple, and practical.</p><p>However, I would not exclude the possibility of improvements, or even<br/>simply of new approaches which some people might prefer: for example,<br/>those of Colonna, Tartini/Cooper, and Fokker.</p><p>One could argue that a new notation in an area where a practical<br/>system is already in use should be asked to overcome a certain<br/>presumption in favor of that system: the new alternative should be<br/>good enough not only to serve the purposes for which it is designed at<br/>least equally well, but to justify the possible inconvenience of<br/>changing from the old system to the new, or of sometimes &quot;translating&quot;<br/>between them.</p><p>In my opinion, George, your system meets that burden, and does it both<br/>amply and in style. The loving care you have put into this saggital<br/>notation, your patience in refining it step by step for conceptual<br/>elegance and readability, are reflected in the version you now have to<br/>offer. I have been deeply honored to have played some small role in<br/>this process, one that makes me all the more appreciative of the<br/>creativity and disciplined imagination you have brought to this<br/>effort.</p><p>As a result, our community has a compelling new alternative for<br/>notating 72-EDO, and promoting communication about many fine points of<br/>intonation and musical structure.</p><p>Of course, time is the best test of any notation, and I urge that we<br/>all give George Secor&apos;s masterful solution a fair and open seeing --<br/>and hearing -- and from there make our own critical judgements.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=32694 href="#32694">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2002 2:26:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Anyone!<br/>    Where is this notation, i couldn&apos;t find it!</p><p>&quot;M.
