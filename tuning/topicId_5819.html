Example: the dorian mode<br/>&gt;&gt;of Cmaj, re-rooted on C as is done in the diamond, has 2 flats (3rd and<br/>&gt;&gt;7th).  Transposing Cmaj by its second degree gives Dmaj, which has two<br/>&gt;&gt;sharps (also 3rd and 7th).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Isn&apos;t that totally obvious?</p><p>I think so.  Does this mean that CS and self TC are the same?  In<br/>particular, since all of a scale&apos;s modes share the same diamond, CS is a<br/>property of scales.  But all of a scale&apos;s modes do not share the same<br/>square set, so is self TC a property of modes or scales?  That is: if one<br/>mode of a scale has self TC, do all modes?</p><p>&gt;I mean, taking the second mode is completely equivalent to transposing<br/>&gt;_down_ by the interval from tonic to second degree. What scale could<br/>&gt;possibly not have this property?</p><p>That transposing a scale by any ratio and its reciprocal would not change<br/>the accidentals the same amount in opposite directions?  None.  So I<br/>retract my statement that it is remarkable in the diatonic scale.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
