The graph shows 9/7 as<br/>&gt;the more concordant of the two intervals, with a pronounced dip of its<br/>&gt;own; 11/9 is perched at the top of an almost-flat mesa between 6/5<br/>&gt;and 5/4.</p><p>&gt;But 11/9 is the &quot;neutral third&quot;, which several people have described<br/>&gt;as relatively pleasant, whereas 9/7 is the &quot;car horn third&quot;, quite<br/>&gt;irritating-sounding on its own, though part of a well-tuned 7-limit<br/>&gt;dominant 9th chord.</p><p>&gt;The graph &quot;makes sense&quot; just looking at the larger numbers in 11/9 vs.<br/>&gt;9/7, yet for some reason the impression of the intervals does not<br/>&gt;match, to my ears.</p><p>Remember, John, the s=0.6% curve corresponds to an ideal listener listening<br/>in the ideal frequency range, around 3000Hz, pretty damn high. Try listening<br/>to 11:9 and 9:7 (and, of course, out-of-tune versions of those intervals) up<br/>there and see what you think. More appropriate for typical musical purposes<br/>might be s=1.5%. I graphed that -- see<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/ent_015.jpg">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/perlich/ent_015.jpg</a>. Although 11:9 is<br/>still higher than 9:7, they are both local maxima and 9:7 sits atop a much<br/>taller hump. As I&apos;ve said before, the overall downward slope of the curve is<br/>an artifact of the Farey series, and, controlling for that, 9:7 may be<br/>higher in this graph. I would need to make some graphs using a Tenney<br/>(numerator times denominator) limit, or other series, to make it easier to<br/>make direct comparisons of intervals that are not roughly the same size. I<br/>anticipate that virtually the same local minima will come up (given an s<br/>value) regardless of the type of series I start with, but it would be good<br/>to be sure . . .</p></div>
