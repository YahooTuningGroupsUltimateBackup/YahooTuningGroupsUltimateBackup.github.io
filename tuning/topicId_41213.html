For the modes of music are never disturbed without<br/>&gt; unsettling of the most<br/>&gt; fundamental political and social conventions&iuml;&iquest;&half; (Respublica 424c).&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The paper is not without it&apos;s flaws though, for one there is the<br/>&gt; cringe-inducing equation of &apos;well-tempered&apos; with<br/>&gt; &apos;equal-tempered&apos;.</p><p>it&apos;s good that you know and point out the difference ...<br/>there are a *lot* of papers in the tuning literature which<br/>make that fallacious equation.</p><p>based on my research, it seems to me that in fact it was<br/>standard practice to do so for almost the entire 20th century.</p><p>it was only in the late 1980s that most writers on tuning<br/>began using &quot;well-tempered&quot; to refer specifically to the<br/>12-tone irregular circulating temperaments.  i believe<br/>(but could be mistaken) that in the German-speaking areas<br/>where these temperaments were popular, they went by the<br/>name of &quot;equal-beating&quot; temperaments ... or at least, i<br/>think some of them did.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=41215 href="#41215">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/26/2002 10:37:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i believe<br/>&gt; (but could be mistaken) that in the German-speaking areas<br/>&gt; where these temperaments were popular, they went by the<br/>&gt; name of &quot;equal-beating&quot; temperaments ... or at least, i<br/>&gt; think some of them did.</p><p>&quot;equal-beating&quot; refers to a class of temperaments, some of which are<br/>well-tempered, and some of which aren&apos;t -- specifically, those which<br/>were tuned by setting certain beat rates equal to one another. for<br/>example, smith&apos;s 5/18-comma meantone tuning (well, not exactly, but<br/>at least it approximated 5/18-comma to a ridiculous number of decimal<br/>places) is derived by making the perfect fifth and the major sixth,<br/>constructed above any given pitch, have the same rate of beating.</p></div>
