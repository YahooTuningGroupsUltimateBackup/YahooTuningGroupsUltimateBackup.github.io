As before, I&apos;m delighted.</p><p>In truth, what I love most about the CD is the playing of Enid Katahn.<br/>Her touch makes the music sing!  Grieg&apos;s &quot;Glochengelaute&quot; is<br/>mesmerizing, and Chopin&apos;s &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; is irresistible.</p><p>And the temperaments do seem to help; to my ear they give the music a<br/>certain three-dimensional quality that is missing from 12-tET.  As with<br/>the previous disk, I found nothing objectionable about the tunings<br/>present.  The meantone does provide for some &quot;interesting&quot; scale steps<br/>in certain places, quite noticeably different from 12-tone.  All the<br/>well-temperaments, on the other hand, seemed quite subtle to my ear,<br/>though certainly beneficial.</p><p>This time, Ed has included numbers that show the distribution of errors<br/>in major thirds, a welcome addition.  Just a slight quibble with the<br/>graphics: the width of the bars does not always match the numbers<br/>printed beside.  As a method for conveying tuning, however, I found the<br/>graphics a very good choice.</p><p>As before, my sensations as to subtlety of tuning may be heavily skewed<br/>by my experiments with much more radical departures from 12-tET.</p><p>Also as before, I will definitely pull this CD off the shelf whenever I<br/>want to hear these works done on an acoustic piano.  Congratulations,<br/>Ed!!  And what is the next project?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
