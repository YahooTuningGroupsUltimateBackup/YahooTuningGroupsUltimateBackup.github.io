Start with this &quot;Tuning for Beginners&quot; page:</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/start.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/start.htm</a></p><p>Then move on to</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/tuning.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/tuning.htm</a></p><p>where you&apos;ll find plenty of articles on scales and temperaments.</p><p>Another theorist you may enjoy reading is Erv Wilson -- peruse the<br/>articles at</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html</a></p><p>I&apos;m planning a huge project which will, in a unified manner, go<br/>through a very large number of scales and temperaments with full-<br/>color diagrams . . . I have a small &quot;preview&quot; of this available for<br/>$5 . . . it&apos;s called _The Forms of Tonality_ . . . you may e-mail me<br/>if you&apos;d like a copy (I&apos;ll also throw in my paper _Tuning, Tonality,<br/>and Twenty-Two Tone Temperament_ for free).</p></div>
