The Luver folks were so impressed they<br/>gave me my own show. Oh...so flattering!</p><p>Check out his ezine, he gets around -</p><p>Perfect Sound Forever, the net zine:<br/><a href="http://www.furious.com/perfect/index.html">http://www.furious.com/perfect/index.html</a></p><p>There were three concerts this year, June 4, 5 &amp; 6.<br/>I was at the Sunday show, Jason went to the Friday and Saturday shows.</p><p>And I&apos;ll stick my little comments in, here &amp; there.</p><p>&gt; Story of Junk<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Taking a primitive tack<br/>&gt; that&apos;s more DIY than any punk band&apos;s, Skip La Plante&apos;s<br/>&gt; collective Music for Homemade Instruments recycles the<br/>&gt; city&apos;s garbage for its annual concert series, which has<br/>&gt; been held in La Plante&apos;s Bowery loft since 1976. An eight-piece<br/>&gt; group of middle-agers banging on pans and boards and blowing<br/>&gt; on tubes and bottles fresh from the dumpster&#xFFFD; seems<br/>&gt; like a damn farce, and it is. But there&apos;s also a landfill<br/>&gt; of know-how behind it, all in the lowbrow/highbrow<br/>&gt; tradition of P.D.Q. Bach and Spike Jones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fresh from an Avery Fisher<br/>&gt; Hall exhibit,</p><p>And the American Festival of Microtonal Music too.</p><p>&gt; MFHI bucked the usual &quot;here&apos;s our art,<br/>&gt; eat it up&quot; attitude for the crowd of 40 or so (including<br/>&gt; many precocious tykes), with each of the composers<br/>&gt; explaining their pieces and the instruments. David<br/>&gt; Simons&apos;s Harry Partch tribute (&quot;This Hoary Perch&quot;)<br/>&gt; featured &quot;string stretchers&quot; (hinged wood strung with wire)<br/>&gt; and sounded like a crazed ukulele troop<br/>&gt; playing Sousa.</p><p>This piece was performed at AFMM this year. This version<br/>included a third slide *guitar* monochord. These instruments<br/>have the ratios marked on the wood under the string and use<br/>whatever for a slide. In the past - tin cans, I noticed<br/>a shot glass or two on Sunday afternon. I think the<br/>wood body was molding [you know, between the floor and the wall].<br/>The string and the wood sat on top of Styrofoam packing<br/>material, a common Music for Homemade Instruments resonator.</p><p>&gt; His &quot;The Collective Chok&quot; had<br/>&gt; a chorus of label-intact soda and juice bottles<br/>&gt; tooting. John Bertles&apos;s solo barrage, &quot;Critical Mess,&quot;<br/>&gt; deployed turntable chimes, a toy car equipped with<br/>&gt; microphone, and alarm clocks. His other piece,<br/>&gt; &quot;The Camel&apos;s Back,&quot; was introduced as &quot;the first<br/>&gt; virtuoso piece for soda straws.&quot; For Jody Kruskal&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;Latex,&quot; huge balloons were scraped and deflated,<br/>&gt; and later distributed for audience participation.<br/>&gt; Lisa Karrer&apos;s &quot;My Cousin Paula,&quot; a spoken-word account<br/>&gt; of a nightmarish boating accident, was punctuated by<br/>&gt; spinning, droning windwands (wood strung with rubber<br/>&gt; bands). La Plante contributed &quot;Cycle for Blown Instruments&quot;<br/>&gt; with plastic tubes played as trumpets and bagpipes,<br/>&gt; climaxing in dissonance.</p><p>Flutes and bottles. Real nice on the fly microtonality.<br/>A big drone. What&apos;s the tuning? Incidental!</p><p>&gt; The centerpiece was La Plante&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;Themes and Variations,&quot; a childlike 13-part arrangement</p><p>This is the 13tet piece from the AFMM Microthon with extra movements.<br/>By the time I heard it, they really fine tuned the performance!<br/>I still really like that canon.</p><p>&gt; executed with table-leg marimba, broiler pans, and humidor<br/>&gt; panpipes, as intricately played as a gamelan piece<br/>&gt; (half of MFHI moonlight in gamelan ensembles).</p><p>And for me, this gamelan experience really shows in the compositions.</p><p>&gt; The show was at once laughable, educational, ridiculous,<br/>&gt; and inspiring. Kids, try this at home. &#xFFFD; Jason Gross</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
