I suspected that, context permitting, these intervals might<br/>instead correspond to harmonics in the rarefied upper registers. I<br/>developed a loose technique for finding such numbers: given 2 to power<br/>of n/12, take 2 to power of N + n/12, N = 0,1,2,3...If the whole-part<br/>of the number is odd then ignore the remainder and divide by 2 to<br/>power of N.

For minor 3rd, N = 4 gives 16:19 or 19/16=1.1875 (much closer<br/>than 6/5=1.2, and with the further advantage that 16 is octave<br/>equivalent to the tonic-fundamental while 5 is not). N=9 gives<br/>609/512=1.1894...and so on.<br/>My question is: Is there some way of determining some realistic limit,<br/>either in our hearing or even in the waves themselves?

You really<br/>should be able to test these things.  It isn&apos;t that complex.</p><p>Yes, the limits of this are related to human psychology and<br/>physiology.  Sure, *some* of the 12ET notes are close enough to<br/>harmonic to have essentially the same effect on listeners, but that<br/>doesn&apos;t prove anything.</p><p>Take a jazz guitarist who plays through an amp with a chorus effect...<br/>The chorus detunes the note slightly and creates a busy, slightly<br/>wavering sound.  That has a certain level of just a little tension for<br/>the listener, and that&apos;s pleasing in some ways.  And in that case,<br/>there is a decent range of a few cents in which no particular precise<br/>point has any change for the listener because it is all wavering and<br/>detuned anyway.</p><p>There is simply a lot more to this than theoretical numbers and<br/>tuning.  If you TELL people VERBALLY that they should listen for a<br/>particular sound and it is the main resolution, they&apos;ll relate<br/>everything to that and try to predict when it is coming and assess the<br/>best they can when it comes.  And if they believe that it arrived,<br/>then they&apos;ll feel a sense of resolution.  This is completely<br/>independent of whether the same sound did in fact arrive or what<br/>happens with the whole rest of the musical context.</p><p>The question is what expectations and predictions listeners develop<br/>unconsciously when they are not told anything.  And this relates to<br/>MANY factors, from being trained musicians or not, stylistically<br/>biased or experienced, having heard the piece before, the recording<br/>before, and yes it also includes things like harmonic support.</p><p>After you take into account all these related factors you will realize<br/>that maybe there are more important questions than finding some very<br/>complex rational number to justify 12ET intellectually.  There&apos;s very<br/>little chance that listeners experience it that way.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p><p> --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi everyone.

For example, the mediant of<br/> 6:5 and 5:4 is 11:9, and this is indeed very near the harmonic<br/> entropy maximum South of 5:4.  So intervals flatter than 11:9<br/> are more likely to be heard as 6:5 approximations than 5:4<br/> approximations.</p><p> &gt;    Suppose we actually take &quot;advantage&quot; of the fact the ears<br/> &gt; seems to round notes up or down to the nearest fraction to make<br/> &gt; extra notes both about the limit ABOVE and BELOW the perfect<br/> &gt; fraction thus doubling the number of possible notes in the scale<br/> &gt; while still fooling the brain that they are &quot;in tune&quot;?</p><p> Yeah, just imagine!</p><p> You&apos;ve discovered temperament.</p><p> &gt; Note I&apos;m not familiar with n*d notation...and I&apos;m guessing<br/> &gt; n * d = x number of cents</p><p> No.  For a ratio n/d (as in Numerator and Denominator),<br/> it is the product n * d.

Though<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t know temperament (as it seems now) means more than<br/>&gt; &quot;toward a clear tone&quot; but rather &quot;within a defined amount of<br/>&gt; space from a clear tone&quot;.  In that case, I&apos;m guessing, 7-tone JI<br/>&gt; is essentially either &quot;non-tempered&quot; because it does not contain<br/>&gt; any estimations?</p><p>The point of temperament is to get pitches to serve double,<br/>triple, etc. duty in terms of JI.  It&apos;s a bit confusing because<br/>people think of &quot;temperaments&quot; as tunings, but what they really<br/>are is mappings that define the double/triple/etc. duties.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what this 7-note JI is you keep mentioning, but<br/>you can get JI to approximate things.  The best-known example<br/>is Pythagorean tuning.  12 pure 5ths will give you usable<br/>major 3rds in the same spots that 12-ET does.  But the idea<br/>is that making the 5ths flat 2 cents improves these 3rds more<br/>than it damages the 5ths.  That&apos;s the idea behind tempered<br/>tunings.  But either way the mapping is the same.</p><p>Two pure 4ths will give you something that sounds like a 7:4,<br/>but if we make the 4ths flat we can improve the 7:4 more than<br/>we damage the 4ths.  Or so the theory goes.</p><p>&gt;   I was just wondering if someone in history had deliberately<br/>&gt; tried to make a scale out of &quot;maximum acceptable temperament<br/>&gt; errors&quot; on both sides of an ideal tone from JI, not just one<br/>&gt; or the other, in the quest to achieve a higher degree of tonal<br/>&gt; freedom without sounding odd to most listeners.</p><p>Yes some people do advocate high-error temperaments.  Herman<br/>Miller is one person who&apos;s used them in inspiring ways (check<br/>out his music!).  Easley Blackwood also did some nice work<br/>in this space with 15-ET.</p><p>&gt; If I have your article right that would mean around 3 cents<br/>&gt; and/or when you hit the other side of the &quot;entropy maximum&quot;<br/>&gt; or area of maximum dissonance.</p><p>In most cases you&apos;d hit 3 cents first.  You seemed to be asking<br/>about a constant fudge factor so I gave that as an example.<br/>You could use something I&apos;d call &quot;inverse weighted error&quot;, which<br/>would temper simple intervals more than complex ones (since their<br/>basins of attraction, if you will, are wider).  But what is<br/>usually done is &quot;weighted error&quot;, which tempers simple intervals<br/>less.  This is because even though their basins are wider they<br/>are also much deeper.  So a given amount of tuning error increases<br/>the dissonance more (because the walls of basin are steeper) and<br/>the idea is to minimize the total amount of dissonance doled out<br/>to the listener.</p><p>Hope that makes sense,</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=76653 href="#76653">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 2:37:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>up to the 10/7 for instance?<br/>but what about 9/8, 10/9 etc.<br/>even 28/27 can be learned which means we can hear it</p><p>but maybe this would apply more to frequency than ratio</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Auditory neuroscience is now probing the limits of periodicity<br/>&gt; detection in the ear/brain.

We are very used to C-Eb being a 6/5 minor third<br/>&gt; because we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hear it played that way on every other instrument than on a piano<br/>&gt; or a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; guitar. I would say that if you were to play an entire piece and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; replace all of the 6/5 minor thirds with 19/16 minor thirds and the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5/4 major thirds with 32/19 major thirds, you would hear the 19/16 as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; being an out of tune 6/5 and the 32/19 as being an out of tune 5/4,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; unless you somehow managed to create the distinction between 19/16<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 6/5 in people&apos;s minds. It is possible to use these intervals that<br/>&gt; way,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but as that music hasn&apos;t been so explored yet, I think that the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; current human condition is to hear those intervals as 6/5 and 5/4<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intervals.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Although I think it is noteworthy that my 12tet ears often hear major<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thirds that are slightly sharp as sounding very &quot;in tune&quot; and<br/>&gt; having a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; character all their own that is quite distinct from 5/4 -- so you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; might be onto something.

I was wondering if you could help me answer a<br/>&gt; question.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It never made sense to me that the tempered intervals in the<br/>&gt; 12 tone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tuning system correspond to the irrational numbers 2 to power<br/>&gt; of n/12<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (n = 1,2,...12). This is because these numbers are by definition<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; aperiodic and therefore without a tonic (e.g. Pythagoras&apos;<br/>&gt; proof that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sqrt 2 or flat 5th interval has no rational number<br/>&gt; corresponding to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it). I suspected that, context permitting, these intervals might<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instead correspond to harmonics in the rarefied upper registers. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; developed a loose technique for finding such numbers: given 2<br/>&gt; to power<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of n/12, take 2 to power of N + n/12, N = 0,1,2,3...If the<br/>&gt; whole-part<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the number is odd then ignore the remainder and divide by 2 to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; power of N.

Same thing with seconds and sevenths- they&apos;re<br/>quite accurate when they appear in terms of fourths and fifths or<br/>9/8, and in other contexts, altered tones etc. they&apos;re vague enough<br/>to do many duties.</p><p>Equating 400 cents with 5/4 is just plain boloney. Sometimes 400<br/>cents suggests 5/4, sometimes  400 cents on paper IS 5/4 in actual<br/>physical performance. Sometimes 400 cents is doing a fine job as<br/>81/64, or suggesting 9/7- or anything inbetween.</p><p>&gt;  Auditory neuroscience is now probing the limits of periodicity<br/>&gt;  detection in the ear/brain.

Anyway the whole issue of<br/>approximation can&apos;t be done out of context- when I have a minor<br/>third, a middle third and a major third in a tuning (that is, almost<br/>always), that changes the picture. And the nature of things like<br/>13/10 depends on context- assuming a roughly diatonic skeleton, is it<br/>a &quot;thirth&quot; or &quot;foird&quot;? Which must bear on approximation.</p></div>
