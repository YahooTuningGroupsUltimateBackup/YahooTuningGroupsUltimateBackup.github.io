But in bleu you temper them all to the same interval, about 140 cents, and then just make a chain of that interval, so every set of four consecutive notes in the chain is supposed to sound like 11:12:13:14. Eventually you need one step of a different size to complete the octave.</p><p>But here&apos;s the real kicker: five of these 140 cent steps makes a 3/2!</p><p>The obvious equal temperament to use here is 17, but some of its intervals are more out of tune than they need to be, particularly 3/2. I think a 17-note circulating temperament would be a fun thing to try.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2011 7:54:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Great for people who like to ignore 5, and I know you are out there.

And that puts a finger on the problem: 5*4 = 20, so the complexity of 5 is 20. It&apos;s not that it&apos;s not supposed to be there, it isn&apos;t there unless you reach for it; it&apos;s too complex.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2011 11:02:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jul 1, 2011 at 10:28 AM, Keenan Pepper &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Great for people who like to ignore 5, and I know you are out there.

Progression is not a subgroup temperament. As a 13-limit temperament, it tempers out 26/25 and 36/35. What all that means in practice, though, is that you are willing to accept a really sharp third as what 5/4 is mapped to. If you use the same 60edo tuning as I used for the scales for bleu, you get to call 420 cents an approximation of 5/4. To bleu temperament, that&apos;s a 14/11, which makes sense. If you add 55/54 to the mix, you get the 8d&amp;17 temperament, which if you use the POTE tuning has a good third, but the fifth has been pissed on; if you add instead 81/80 you get the 26&amp;43 temperament. Progression, however, is what you get by adding in 36/35, getting the 8d&amp;9 temperament, with a sharp third which you plan to claim as a 5/4.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2011 11:56:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jul 1, 2011 at 2:38 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So that&apos;s what this temperament is called, &quot;bleu&quot;?
