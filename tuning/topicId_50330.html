Every<br/>unique contribution is a good thing.  15-edo probably won&apos;t be of particular<br/>importance to me, but the ideas that spread into the community by<br/>combination of everyone&apos;s contributions will end up helping me some day,<br/>since notation *will* become a real issue for me sooner or later.
