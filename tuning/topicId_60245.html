(Was: Further doubts ...)</p><p>  A brat of 2 goes with 1/7 comma. 5/14 comma is a brat of 1/4, and is for a fifth (a root of f^4-4f+1) even flatter than 19-et. However, there *is* a 2 in there; in fact, two 2s, if we look at the associated beat ratios for all three chord consituants taken in pairs, we get two 2 beat ratios.</p><p>  If someone were looking for a 19-tone circulating temperament, this<br/>  fifth would be a good one to keep in mind.</p></div>
