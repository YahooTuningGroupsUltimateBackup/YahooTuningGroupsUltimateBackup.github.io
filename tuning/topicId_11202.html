The piece is based on a discussion on the Tuning<br/>list a few months ago on the feelings of the 1:1, 7:6, 3:2 minor<br/>harmonies. I decided to study some of the &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot;<br/>tonalities available in the tonality diamond.</p><p>I call the first chord subminor (1:1, 7:6, 3:2 from the otonality),<br/>then minor (1:1, 6:5, 3:2 from the utonality), major (1:1, 5:4, 3:2<br/>from the otonality) and supermajor (1:1, 9:7, 3:2 from the<br/>utonality.) The progression keeps the first and fifth of the triad<br/>constant, and only moves the third, from the lowest point in the<br/>subminor (7:6), to the highest point in the supermajor (9:7), and<br/>then back again. This gives an opportunity to study the major and<br/>minor tonality choices up close.</p><p>One interesting aspect of this study is that it is tough to tell when<br/>the progression goes from 7:6 to 6:5 or from 5:4 to 9:7, but very<br/>easy to tell when it changes from 6:5 to 5:4 (minor to major). The<br/>major tonality is distinct from the supermajor by virtue of the power<br/>of the overtone series. The supermajor sounds weak by comparison.</p><p>Each progression also carries some extra notes along, from either its<br/>otonality or utonality group in the tonality diamond.</p><p>The diamond I use looks like this:</p><p>                     11:8</p><p>                 9:8     11:10</p><p>            7:4       9:5     11:6</p><p>        3:2      7:5      3:2      11:7</p><p>    5:4     6:5       7:6      9:7      11:9</p><p>1:1     1:1      1:1      1:1       1:1     1:1<br/> x                x                  x<br/>    8:5     5:3      12:7      14:9     18:11</p><p>        4:3      10:7     4:3       14:11</p><p>            8:7      10:9      12:11</p><p>                 16:9     20:11</p><p>                     16:11</p><p>Start at the third 1:1 from the left (abovce the x) and move up and<br/>to the right for the subminor. Then start at the same 1:1, but move<br/>up the the left for the minor. Then go to the first 1:1 on the left<br/>(above the x), and move up and to the right for the major. Finally,<br/>for the supermajor, move to the 5th 1:1 from the left (above the x),<br/>and move up and to the left. As long as you are using those three<br/>notes of the otonality or utonality, also extend the scale material<br/>to the other notes of the respective tonality. Otonality goes up to<br/>the right, down to the left. Utonality goes up to the left, down to<br/>the right.</p><p>Melodic material and some harmonic material come from the six note<br/>scale of the tonality. Most of the harmonic material is based on the<br/>three notes of the triad. The subminor, minor, major, supermajor<br/>chords are the prevalent harmonies. Hence the title of the piece:<br/>MajorMinor</p><p>Rhythm is 3:4, divided up either 12 sixteenth notes, three quarter<br/>notes, or 4 dotted eighth notes.</p><p>The piece is realized using Csound, and a sample based instrument<br/>using samples from the McGill University Master Samples. This is an<br/>amazing set of orchestral instruments assembled by the university<br/>several years ago by some master musicians and technicians. Each<br/>instrument is represented by 44kHz stereo samples of six different<br/>notes per octave. The string section was very interesting to work<br/>with, since it has samples for pizzacato, martele, vibrato, non-<br/>vibrato, ensemble, and harmonics for bass, cello, viola, and violin.<br/>I used mostly the pizz, martele, and harmonics.</p><p>Csound allows terrific control over the sound envelope (I use 18<br/>different envelop patterns), stereo spacing, dynamics. Csound imposes<br/>is no practical limit to the number of stereo 44kHz samples in a<br/>single piece. I use 136 different samples, each one 50 to 100k in<br/>size, chosen from 1300 different instrument samples in the McGill set.</p><p>The cello soloist (cello martele) plays with amazing power and<br/>intensity, the other martele strings are crisp and sharp, and the<br/>pizzicato playing would leave a normal string quartet with blistered<br/>fingers. Thanks to the wonders of Csound, no one gets hurt, and they<br/>all play in tune!</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Mercer Island, WA</p></div>
