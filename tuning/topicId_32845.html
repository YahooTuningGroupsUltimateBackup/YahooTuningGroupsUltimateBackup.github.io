One must be cautious, then, abut<br/>confusing interest with expertise; it may just be an interest in music that<br/>is correlated with mathematical intelligence.

Expertise in any area means not just interest but a<br/>lifelong active occupation in said area, and a consistent challenging<br/>of oneself to greater heights of acheivement.

In 1900 David Hilbert gave the most famous mathematical speech on record to the International Congress of Mathematicians; he proposed problems for the future to solve. At that time probably *only* Hilbert had a good enough grasp of all of mathematics to have done this, and by the time he died no one could do it.
