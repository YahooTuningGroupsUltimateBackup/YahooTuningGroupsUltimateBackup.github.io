Alternative solutions and circular 2-3-7 JI system<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>Having surveyed some of the possibilities for our neo-Gothic adaptive<br/>JI system with two 12-note Pythagorean keyboards tuned a septimal<br/>comma apart, we first consider some alternative solutions to the<br/>problem of combining pure or near-pure ratios of 2, 3, and 7. In a<br/>neo-Gothic setting, such alternatives include septimal schisma<br/>temperaments, regular temperaments with fifths in the vicinity of<br/>704.61 cents, and 22-tone equal temperament (22-tET).</p><p>Returning to our 24-note adaptive scheme, we then explore how it could<br/>be enlarged to a circulating 106-note system with two 53-note cycles<br/>of pure fifths a septimal comma apart, and a remarkable property of<br/>near-perfect closure which this system would have. Such a system would<br/>afford a virtually pure realization of the &quot;web of 2, 3, and 7.&quot;[29]</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------<br/>5.1. Alternative neo-Gothic solutions for ratios of 2-3-7<br/>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In comparing neo-Gothic tunings which realize or approximate pure<br/>ratios of 2, 3, and 7, we might weigh such factors as accuracy,<br/>evenness or regularity, conceptual simplicity, minimum tuning size,<br/>and simplicity or intricacy for the performer. These last two factors<br/>tend to be related: the larger the tuning, the more likely it is that<br/>commas or dieses are routinely going to complicate -- or enrich -- the<br/>life of the keyboardist.</p><p>Especially for larger tunings, the availability of other favored<br/>neo-Gothic ratios can also be a main attraction: for example, regular<br/>major and minor thirds around 14:11 (~417.51 cents) and 13:11 (~289.20<br/>cents), the neo-Gothic &quot;11-favor&quot;; and diminished fourths and<br/>augmented seconds around 21:17 (~365.83 cents) and 17:14 (~336.13<br/>cents), the &quot;17-flavor&quot; of submajor/supraminor thirds.</p><p>Together, these factors happily conspire to prevent any one system<br/>from being a &quot;perfect&quot; solution, and to promote a multiplicity of<br/>systems in keeping with the ideals of Ivor Darreg.[30]</p><p>------------------------------------------------<br/>5.1.1. Septimal schisma tunings and temperaments<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>As explained in Section 1, our adaptive JI system grew out of a<br/>regular 24-note Pythagorean or &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; tuning with two 12-note<br/>manuals in identical Eb-G# arrangements tuned a Pythagorean comma<br/>apart (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents).</p><p>To achieve pure ratios of 7, our adaptive system stretches the fifth<br/>connecting the two manuals by a septimal schisma of 33554432:33480783<br/>(~3.80 cents), increasing their spacing from a Pythagorean comma to a<br/>septimal comma of 64:63 (~27.26 cents). All other fifths remain pure.</p><p>Using a carat (^) to show a note raised by a septimal comma, and<br/>Vicentino&apos;s &quot;comma&quot; or small interval sign, here an apostrophe (&apos;), to<br/>show a note raised by a septimal schisma above its Pythagorean<br/>position, we can diagram this scheme as follows, with two possible<br/>names for each note on the upper keyboard:</p><p>(D#&apos;- A#&apos; - E#&apos;- B#&apos;- F##&apos;-C##&apos;-G##&apos;-D##&apos;-A##&apos;-E##&apos;-B##&apos;- F###&apos;)<br/> Eb^- Bb^ - F^ - C^ - G^ - D^ - A^ - E^ - B^ - F#^ - C#^ - G#^</p><p> Eb - Bb  - F  - C  - G  - D  - A  - E  - B  - F# -  C# -  G#</p><p>In principle, we could tune this JI system by ear using only audibly<br/>pure ratios: the usual Pythagorean fifths, fourths, and octaves on<br/>each manual, plus a pure 7-based interval such as a 7:6 minor third or<br/>possibly a 7:4 minor seventh to bridge the transition between the two<br/>manuals.[31]</p><p>We might view the result as a chain of 23 fifths: 11 pure fifths on<br/>each keyboard (Eb-G#, Eb^-G#^), linked by the &quot;septimal schisma fifth&quot;<br/>G#-Eb^ or G#-D#&apos; at the complex integer ratio of 16777216:11160261<br/>(~705.76 cents), a 3.80-cent septimal schisma wider than pure.</p><p>As a JI system, this scheme therefore also belongs to the family of<br/>septimal schisma tunings and temperaments of a general kind described<br/>and advocated by Graham Breed[32], where one or more fifths in a<br/>Pythagorean chain is slightly widened in order to obtain or very<br/>closely approximate pure 7-based ratios.</p><p>More specifically, our system might be described as a &quot;rational<br/>adaptive schisma tuning&quot; (RAST), in which a single fifth bears the<br/>full burden of the septimal schisma adjustment. In regular schisma<br/>temperaments of the type we are about to consider, this burden is<br/>dispersed equally among all fifths along the tuning chain, each<br/>tempered by a very small and irrational quantity.</p><p>From the viewpoint of conceptual elegance, our RAST solution might be<br/>said to have the advantage that only a single fifth is &quot;virtually<br/>tempered by ratio,&quot; with all intervals remaining integer-based; and<br/>the disadvantage that this fifth represents a slight irregularity in<br/>what would otherwise be a perfectly regular system.</p><p>From the viewpoint of accuracy, we obtain pure ratios of 3 and 7<br/>within the base range of our &quot;standard&quot; gamut Eb-G#, but with the<br/>audible compromise of the fifth G#-D#&apos; at around 3.80 cents wide,<br/>about as impure as in 17-tET (~705.88 cents, ~3.93 cents wide).[33]</p><p>In a regular septimal schisma temperament, we avoid this slight<br/>irregularity while seeking to keep all fifths and 7-based intervals<br/>within our gamut &quot;virtually pure&quot; to the ear by adjusting each fifth<br/>equally.</p><p>To obtain pure 7:4 minor sevenths and 8:7 major seconds, formed from<br/>chains of 14 fifths up or down, we could temper each fifth by 1/14 of<br/>a 3.80-cent septimal schisma; for pure 7:6 minor thirds and 12:7 major<br/>sixths, by 1/15 septimal schisma; and for pure 9:7 major thirds and<br/>14:9 minor sixths, by 1/16 septimal schisma.</p><p>Here is a table of these regular temperaments:</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Chain        Pure intervals      Fifth          Tempering<br/>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>14 fifths      8:7 / 7:4     ~702.227 cents   +~0.272 cents<br/>15 fifths     12:7 / 7:6     ~702.209 cents   +~0.254 cents<br/>16 fifths      9:7 / 14:9    ~702.193 cents   +~0.238 cents<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Suppose we choose the middle alternative of a 1/15-septimal schisma<br/>temperament with pure 12:7 major sixths and 7:6 minor thirds; fifths<br/>and the other 7-based intervals of our table are alike impure by the<br/>amount of the temperament, about 0.25 cents, remaining &quot;virtually<br/>just.&quot;[34]</p><p>From a theoretical viewpoint, while our RAST approach leaves the<br/>Pythagorean intervals within each manual unaltered, our 1/15-schisma<br/>temperament causes very subtle changes in the global intonational<br/>fabric. Regular major thirds, for example, are slightly enlarged from<br/>a Pythagorean 81:64 (~407.82 cents) to around 408.83 cents, rather<br/>close to a ratio of 19:15 (~409.24 cents); usual diatonic semitones<br/>contract from a Pythagorean 256:243 (~90.22 cents) to around 88.96<br/>cents.[35]</p><p>In practice, the two systems seem musically synonymous, and it is an<br/>open question whether a performer at the 24-note keyboard would notice<br/>any difference of &quot;look and feel&quot; in these two schisma tunings with<br/>their kindred qualities of accuracy -- and intricacy.</p><p>From the viewpoint of the performer, either system is large and<br/>relatively intricate: 24 notes are needed to make 7-based intervals<br/>available at the same number of locations as their regular Pythagorean<br/>counterparts in a 12-note tuning, and septimal comma distinctions at<br/>once complicate and diversify the possible range of sonorities and<br/>progressions.</p><p>In conclusion, one&apos;s choice between a RAST approach and a regular<br/>schisma temperament may reflect one&apos;s conceptual taste for &quot;pure JI<br/>ratios&quot; (in theory!) versus pervasive regularity and symmetry; the<br/>musical kinship between these solutions may be more important than<br/>their theoretical differences.[36]</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>5.1.2. The many-flavored e-based tuning: a 2.65-cent solution<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>While either our 24-note adaptive scheme or a regular septimal schisma<br/>temperament provides pure or virtually pure ratios of 3 and 7 as a<br/>variation on extended Pythagoraen tuning, another intricate 24-note<br/>system combines close approximations of these intervals with others<br/>much favored in neo-Gothic music: the e-based tuning with fifths at<br/>around 704.61 cents (~2.65 cents wide).</p><p>In this tuning, the ratio between the whole-tone and diatonic semitone<br/>is equal to Leonhard Euler&apos;s e, ~2.7182818284590452353603, these<br/>steps having sizes of approximately 209.214 cents and 76.965 cents.</p><p>From a neo-Gothic perspective, the obvious attractions of this tuning<br/>may be found in its first 12 notes. Regular major and minor thirds at<br/>around 418.43 cents and 286.18 cents approximate ideal neo-Gothic<br/>&quot;11-flavor&quot; ratios of 14:11 and 13:11 or 33:28. Diminished fourths and<br/>augmented seconds, at around 363.14 cents and 341.46 cents, are not<br/>too far from ideal &quot;17-flavor&quot; ratios of 21:17 and 17:14, with the<br/>supraminor third leaning rather in the largish or neutral direction<br/>toward 11:9 (~347.41 cents).</p><p>Only after some months of exploring and analyzing the e-based tuning<br/>did I consider the properties of an extended 24-note version, and<br/>discover that in addition to these primary 11-flavor and 17-flavor<br/>intervals, such a larger tuning yields close approximations of<br/>7-flavor intervals, including virtually pure 7:4 minor sevenths and<br/>8:7 major seconds.</p><p>In such a 24-note e-based tuning, two keyboard manuals are tuned apart<br/>by a diesis, the amount by which 12 fifths exceed 7 pure octaves<br/>(analogous to the Pythagorean comma), approximately  55.28 cents. Here<br/>an asterisk (*) is used to show a note raised by a diesis:</p><p>       C#*     Eb*              F#*       G#*    Bb*<br/>C*         D*         E*   F*       G*        A*        B*  C*<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>       C#      Eb               F#        G#     Bb<br/>C          D          E    F        G         A         B   C</p><p>Canvassing this 24-note system, and using a MIDI-like octave notation<br/>with C4 as middle C and higher numbers showing higher octaves, we find<br/>the following approximations for 7-based intervals:</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Ratio  Fifth chain    Description       Example    Size/Variance cents<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> 9:7   13 5ths down   4th-less-diesis   G*3-C4       ~440.11  ~+5.03<br/>14:9   13 5ths up     5th-plus-diesis   D3-A*4       ~759.89  ~-5.03<br/>......................................................................<br/> 7:6   14 5ths up     M2-plus-diesis    E3-F#*3      ~264.50  ~-2.37<br/>12:7   14 5ths down   m7-less-diesis    G*3-F4       ~935.50  ~+2.37<br/>......................................................................<br/> 7:4   15 5ths up     M6-plus-diesis    E3-C#*4      ~969.10  ~+0.28<br/> 8:7   15 5ths down   m3-less-diesis    D*3-F4       ~230.90  ~-0.28<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Not inappropriately, this tuning defined by Euler&apos;s famous _e_ yields<br/>a near-pure 7:4 minor seventh and an excellent approximation of the<br/>7:6 minor third, two intervals he documented and championed as a music<br/>theorist in 1764.[37] The 9:7 major third receives a less accurate but<br/>reasonably fair approximation at about 440.11 cents, just over 5 cents<br/>wide.</p><p>The special musical appeal of the 24-note e-based tuning is that it<br/>combines these 7-flavor intervals with the more obvious 11-flavor and<br/>17-flavor intervals in a single intonational &quot;package.&quot;</p><p>Were we interested only in ratios of 2-3-7, then our adaptive JI<br/>system or a septimal schisma temperament would not only yield purer<br/>ratios of 7, but would avoid the compromising of our fifths by some<br/>2.65 cents.</p><p>Were we interested only in 11-flavor and 17-flavor intervals, we might<br/>choose a temperament in the range from 29-tET (fifths ~703.45 cents,<br/>~1.49 cents wide) to 46-tET (~704.35 cents, ~2.39 cents wide) or the<br/>almost identical tuning with pure 14:11 major thirds (~704.38 cents,<br/>~2.42 cents wide). These tunings involve somewhat less tempering of<br/>the fifth than the e-based system, and often yield more accurate<br/>approximations of such intervals as the 17:14 supraminor third.</p><p>If we seek a single 24-note system uniting 11-flavor, 17-flavor, and<br/>7-flavor intervals, however, then the e-based tuning becomes an<br/>outstanding option, a &quot;2.65-cent solution&quot; made at once intricate and<br/>alluring by the &quot;metachromatic&quot; possibilities of the 55-cent diesis,<br/>the standard cadential semitone in 7-flavor progressions.[38]</p><p>-----------------------------------------<br/>5.1.3. Simplicity and circularity: 22-tET<br/>-----------------------------------------</p><p>In contrast to these intricate 24-note systems, 22-tET with fifths at<br/>around 709.09 cents (~7.14 cents wide) offers regular or &quot;native&quot;<br/>7-flavor intervals conveniently available in a usual 12-note tuning:</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Ratio      Regular interval    22-tET steps    Size/Variance cents<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> 9:7       M3 (e.g. F3-A3)         8            ~436.36   ~+1.28<br/>14:9       m6 (e.g. A3-F4)        14            ~763.64   ~-1.27<br/>..................................................................<br/> 7:6       m3 (e.g. D3-F3)         5            ~272.73   ~+5.86<br/>12:7       M6 (e.g. F3-D4)        17            ~927.27   ~-5.86<br/>..................................................................<br/> 8:7       M2 (e.g. D3-E3)         4            ~218.18  ~-12.99<br/> 7:4       m7 (e.g. E3-D4)        18            ~981.82  ~+12.99<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A hallmark of 22-tET is its dispersal of the septimal comma: the<br/>regular major second at around 218 cents can represent either the<br/>usual Pythagorean interval at 9:8 or the 7-flavor interval at 8:7,<br/>while the 982-cent minor seventh can represent either 16:9 or 7:4.</p><p>The price for this simplicity and convenience is a substantial<br/>compromise not only of the 7:4 or 8:7, but of fifths and fourths, our<br/>primary neo-Gothic concords, varying almost 7.14 cents from pure.  In<br/>typical timbres, 22-tET may approach the far end of the neo-Gothic<br/>spectrum where this compromise becomes increasingly problematic.[39]</p><p>In addition to making 7-flavor intervals available in a 12-note<br/>tuning, 22-tET maximizes melodic evenness by using a single 218-cent<br/>whole-tone for steps of either 9:8 or 8:7, in contrast to the<br/>distinction between these steps in our other systems. Both styles of<br/>intonation -- equal or unequal whole-tone steps -- have their strong<br/>advocates, and like many musical questions this seems one largely of<br/>taste.</p><p>Interestingly, diatonic semitones at ~54.55 cents (1/22 octave) are<br/>somewhat smaller than the 28:27 cadential semitones (~62.96 cents)<br/>precisely realized in our adaptive JI scheme and very closely<br/>approximated in a septimal schisma temperament; but almost identical<br/>in size to the 55.28-cent diesis of our e-based tuning used as a<br/>cadential semitone in 7-flavor progressions.</p><p>In short, while our other solutions for combining ratios of 3 and 7<br/>maximize accuracy and intricacy, 22-tET optimizes convenience and<br/>simplicity as well as melodic evenness by dispersing the septimal<br/>comma; additionally, if circularity is desired, it offers closure in<br/>only 22 notes.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>5.2. Circularity: a 106-note &quot;web of 2-3-7&quot; and the nanisma<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In the 24-note version we have explored, our adaptive JI system for<br/>ratios of 2, 3, and 7 has the slight &quot;flaw&quot; of the impure fifth G#-D#&apos;<br/>(G#-Eb^), &quot;tempered by ratio&quot; a 3.80-cent septimal schisma wide.<br/>Curiously, this asymmetry could be &quot;repaired,&quot; and virtually perfect<br/>closure achieved, if we extended the system to two 53-note Pythagorean<br/>cycles a septimal schisma apart, or 106 notes per octave in all.</p><p>As is well known, a 53-note Pythagorean cycle offers &quot;virtual closure&quot;<br/>from a practical perspective, since 53 pure 3:2 fifths exceed 31 pure<br/>2:1 octaves by only the small quantity sometimes known as Mercator&apos;s<br/>comma, 19383245667680019896796723:19342813113834066795298816 or about<br/>3.615 cents.</p><p>Such a 53-note Pythagorean tuning therefore features 52 pure fifths,<br/>plus an &quot;odd&quot; 53rd fifth &quot;virtually tempered&quot; in the narrow direction<br/>by this comma, at ~698.340 cents. This odd fifth arises between the<br/>53rd note of the cycle, located 52 fifths up or ~501.660 cents above<br/>the initial note, and the pure octave of this initial note.</p><p>Suppose now that we tune two such complete 53-note cycles a septimal<br/>schisma apart -- 33554432:33480783 or ~3.804 cents -- as with our<br/>24-note adaptive JI tuning, obtaining pure ratios of 2-3-7.</p><p>To see the consequences for circularity, let us look at what happens<br/>as we approach the conclusion of the twin 53-note cycles. Here, in<br/>addition to the carat sign (^) raising a note by a septimal comma and<br/>the apostrophe (&apos;) raising a note by a septimal schisma, I use the<br/>&quot;greater than&quot; sign (&gt;) to raise a note by a Pythagorean comma.

For this expression I am most indebted to Jose Wurschmidt, who in<br/>1928 writes in a very different musical context based on ratios of<br/>2-3-5 of the &quot;web of fifths and thirds&quot; (_Quinten-Terzengewebe_),<br/>advocating 118-tET as an excellent approximation. See Brian McLaren,<br/>&quot;A Brief History of Microtonality in the Twentieth Century,&quot;<br/>_Xenharmonikon_ 17:57-110 (Spring 1998), at p. 64.</p><p>30. See ibid., p. 81, quoting Darreg&apos;s statement of 1967: &quot;No one<br/>microtonal system has emerged as the ultimate system, and after trying<br/>out several, I want to work with _all_ of them, each for its unique<br/>qualities.&quot;</p><p>31. Having placed the lower manual in a usual Pythagorean tuning of<br/>Eb-G#, we might take G4 of this manual (G above middle C) and tune E^4<br/>of the upper manual to a pure 7:6 below it, or possibly A^3 to a pure<br/>7:4 below it. The rest of the upper manual would now be tuned in usual<br/>Pythagorean fashion.</p><p>32. See <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/schismic.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/schismic.htm</a>. Since Graham<br/>Breed&apos;s discussion focuses mainly on systems combining ratios of 2-3-5<br/>or 2-3-5-7 or 2-3-5-7-11 (with a &quot;major third&quot; often suggesting 5:4),<br/>his viewpoint may be somewhat different from that involved in<br/>neo-Gothic systems based on ratios of 2-3-7 (with a &quot;major third&quot;<br/>typically suggesting 81:64 or 9:7). Here I use the term &quot;septimal<br/>schisma temperament&quot; rather narrowly to mean a regular temperament<br/>where the fifth is widened by around 1/14-1/16 of a septimal schisma<br/>to obtain near-pure ratios of 3 and 7, i.e. a temperament with fifths<br/>in the range of ~702.19-702.23 cents (~0.23-0.27 cents wide). Graham<br/>Breed favors a fifth at 79/135 octave (702.2222... cents, ~0.267 cents<br/>wide), virtually identical to a 1/14-septimal schisma temperament<br/>(pure 7:4 and 8:7).</p><p>33. In a neo-Gothic setting, we might relish the impurity of G#-D#&apos; as<br/>a stimulating touch of &quot;modal color&quot; at a location having a certain<br/>affinity to the diminished sixth or &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; G#-Eb. Might this<br/>much gentler and more &quot;domesticated&quot; counterpart with its 17-tET-like<br/>size be called a &quot;poodle fifth&quot;?</p><p>34. Intervals formed from 14 fifths up or down (8:7, 7:4) receive<br/>14/15 of their full septimal schisma correction from Pythagorean,<br/>while intervals formed from 16 fifths (9:7, 14:9) receive a slight<br/>overcorrection of 16/15 of the schisma -- in either instance, a<br/>variance of 1/15 schisma or ~0.25 cents. Dave Keenan has suggested<br/>that intervals within about 0.5 cents of pure may be considered as<br/>audibly equivalent to &quot;just.&quot;</p><p>35. The 1/15-septimal schisma tuning is located on the neo-Gothic<br/>spectrum of regular tunings about midway between Pythagorean with its<br/>pure 3:2 fifths at ~701.955 cents and 41-tET (fifths ~702.439 cents,<br/>~0.484 cents wide). While small, the variances of this 1/15-schisma<br/>tuning from our RAST scheme might sometimes be highly desirable. For<br/>example, in the special sixth sonority with a near-11:8 &quot;superfourth&quot;<br/>between the two upper voices, e.g. B3-Eb4-G#^4 cadencing to A3-E4-A4<br/>(see Part IV, Section 4.3.2), this interval has a RAST tuning of<br/>19683:14336 or ~548.77 cents, ~2.55 cents smaller than pure. In the<br/>1/15-schisma tuning, it is ~550.80 cents, within ~0.52 cents of pure.<br/>For either system, incidentally, this very special superfourth unites<br/>the extreme notes of the 23-fifth chain, Eb-G#^.</p><p>36. Analogous choices might include 53-note Pythagorean vs. 53-tET, or<br/>a 31-note cycle of 1/4-comma meantone vs. 31-tET.</p><p>37. See <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm</a>, and<br/>n. 15 (Part III).</p><p>38. For a brief discussion of 7-flavor cadences in the e-based tuning,<br/>see &quot;A gentle introduction to neo-Gothic progressions,&quot; 1, Part 2C,<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16134">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16134</a>. In a forthcoming article<br/>on this tuning, I hope to discuss &quot;metachromatic&quot; sequences moving<br/>between manuals in often surprising ways.</p><p>39. For metallophone-like timbres, 27-tET (fifths ~711.11 cents, ~9.16<br/>cents wide) can have a very pleasant effect in a neo-Gothic setting<br/>with its virtually pure 7:6 and 12:7 approximations (~266.67 cents,<br/>~933.33 cents, only ~0.20 cents respectively narrow and wide), and a<br/>somewhat &quot;gamelan-like&quot; ambiance.</p><p>40. See n. 29; Dave Keenan has remarked that 118-tET is the smallest<br/>equal temperament offering approximations of all 5-odd-limit intervals<br/>within 0.5 cents of pure.</p><p>41. In this 106-note system, as in our 24-note adaptive JI subset,<br/>pure ratios of 8:7, 9:7, 12:7, 27:14, and 81:56 (the 7-based tritone)<br/>are available with the lower note taken from the lower keyboard/cycle,<br/>and the upper note from the upper keyboard/cycle; pure ratios of 7:4,<br/>14:9, 7:6, 28:27, and 112:81 (the 7-based diminished fifth) involve a<br/>lower note from the upper keyboard/cycle and an upper note from the<br/>lower keyboard/cycle. Within a single 53-note cycle, approximations<br/>for these intervals will be a septimal schisma (~3.80 cents) from<br/>pure.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Brad Beyenhof &#x3C;saxman32@saintmail.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2001 11:54:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey people.

The second is perfect pitch -- people with perfect pitch<br/>find it painful to even listen to 12-tET music a quarter-tone sharp. But the<br/>brainwashing can be undone with sufficient exposure. One good way to begin<br/>is with _harmonic_ intervals -- the sensual difference between hearing a<br/>just major third vs. a 12-tET major third _harmonically_ is unmistakeable.</p></div><h3>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>1/19/2001 2:45:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, engell69@g... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Brad Beyenhof&quot; &lt;saxman32@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;ve been looking at previous posts, and I admit<br/>&gt; &gt; that this stuff is a bit over my head.<br/>&gt; You&apos;re not the only one.

Just reading through<br/>your methods of scale construction with fifth chains and temperings<br/>has been both fascinating and informative. And as always with your<br/>discussion of the two manual mapping; powerful imagery of nimble<br/>fingers navigating these scales, makes me yearn to hear some of your<br/>improvisations.</p><p>I&apos;ll add this one to my cherished Schulter Collection. With all your<br/>papers considered together, it looks as though you&apos;ve got a good<br/>portion of a book here!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; While either our 24-note adaptive scheme or a regular septimal<br/>schisma<br/>&gt; temperament provides pure or virtually pure ratios of 3 and 7 as a<br/>&gt; variation on extended Pythagoraen tuning, another intricate 24-note<br/>&gt; system combines close approximations of these intervals with others<br/>&gt; much favored in neo-Gothic music: the e-based tuning with fifths at<br/>&gt; around 704.61 cents (~2.65 cents wide).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this tuning, the ratio between the whole-tone and diatonic<br/>semitone<br/>&gt; is equal to Leonhard Euler&apos;s e, ~2.7182818284590452353603, these<br/>&gt; steps having sizes of approximately 209.214 cents and 76.965 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From a neo-Gothic perspective, the obvious attractions of this<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; may be found in its first 12 notes. Regular major and minor thirds<br/>at<br/>&gt; around 418.43 cents and 286.18 cents approximate ideal neo-Gothic<br/>&gt; &quot;11-flavor&quot; ratios of 14:11 and 13:11 or 33:28. Diminished fourths<br/>and<br/>&gt; augmented seconds, at around 363.14 cents and 341.46 cents, are not<br/>&gt; too far from ideal &quot;17-flavor&quot; ratios of 21:17 and 17:14, with the<br/>&gt; supraminor third leaning rather in the largish or neutral direction<br/>&gt; toward 11:9 (~347.41 cents).</p><p>You really inspire me to try the e constant - haven&apos;t did much with<br/>this yet (mostly phi so far). Very interesting properties!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not inappropriately, this tuning defined by Euler&apos;s famous _e_<br/>yields<br/>&gt; a near-pure 7:4 minor seventh and an excellent approximation of the<br/>&gt; 7:6 minor third, two intervals he documented and championed as a<br/>music<br/>&gt; theorist in 1764.[37] The 9:7 major third receives a less accurate<br/>but<br/>&gt; reasonably fair approximation at about 440.11 cents, just over 5<br/>cents<br/>&gt; wide.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The special musical appeal of the 24-note e-based tuning is that it<br/>&gt; combines these 7-flavor intervals with the more obvious 11-flavor<br/>and<br/>&gt; 17-flavor intervals in a single intonational &quot;package.&quot;</p><p>This is like thinking about my favorite ice-creams! A tastey mix!</p><p>&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 5.2. Circularity: a 106-note &quot;web of 2-3-7&quot; and the nanisma<br/>&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the 24-note version we have explored, our adaptive JI system for<br/>&gt; ratios of 2, 3, and 7 has the slight &quot;flaw&quot; of the impure fifth G#-<br/>D#&apos;<br/>&gt; (G#-Eb^), &quot;tempered by ratio&quot; a 3.80-cent septimal schisma wide.<br/>&gt; Curiously, this asymmetry could be &quot;repaired,&quot; and virtually perfect<br/>&gt; closure achieved, if we extended the system to two 53-note<br/>Pythagorean<br/>&gt; cycles a septimal schisma apart, or 106 notes per octave in all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As is well known, a 53-note Pythagorean cycle offers &quot;virtual<br/>closure&quot;<br/>&gt; from a practical perspective, since 53 pure 3:2 fifths exceed 31<br/>pure<br/>&gt; 2:1 octaves by only the small quantity sometimes known as Mercator&apos;s<br/>&gt; comma, 19383245667680019896796723:19342813113834066795298816 or<br/>about<br/>&gt; 3.615 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such a 53-note Pythagorean tuning therefore features 52 pure fifths,<br/>&gt; plus an &quot;odd&quot; 53rd fifth &quot;virtually tempered&quot; in the narrow<br/>direction<br/>&gt; by this comma, at ~698.340 cents. This odd fifth arises between the<br/>&gt; 53rd note of the cycle, located 52 fifths up or ~501.660 cents above<br/>&gt; the initial note, and the pure octave of this initial note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Suppose now that we tune two such complete 53-note cycles a septimal<br/>&gt; schisma apart -- 33554432:33480783 or ~3.804 cents -- as with our<br/>&gt; 24-note adaptive JI tuning, obtaining pure ratios of 2-3-7.</p><p>This is an absolutely amazing system Margo! Thanks for this<br/>explanation.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For this small difference by which the septimal schisma exceeds the<br/>&gt; comma of Mercator, I propose the term _nanisma_ (from Greek _nano_,<br/>&gt; &quot;tiny,&quot; also used as the prefix for 10^-9, the<br/>American &quot;billionth&quot;).<br/>&gt; The nanisma is a small interval expressed by a large integer ratio:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 649037107316853453566312041152512:648966242035284859600333477874109</p><p>Call the Guinness Book of Records, and pass me a Guinness Stout while<br/>your at it!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In practice, of course, 106 notes may seem like a rather large<br/>tuning;<br/>&gt; but larger systems for JI or near-JI applications are sometimes<br/>&gt; discussed, for example 118-tET for ratios of 2-3-5.[40]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whatever practical uses this 106-note system may invite, and<br/>&gt; electronic implementations for use with MIDI sequencers or the like<br/>&gt; seem quite feasible, the possibility of a circulating and indeed<br/>&gt; almost perfectly circular &quot;web of 2-3-7&quot; based entirely on integer<br/>&gt; ratios may be a notable (however novel or often-rediscovered)<br/>&gt; conclusion for JI theory.[41]</p><p>Actually I find allot of value in studying large scales and playing<br/>(subsets) from them.</p><p>&gt; ---------------<br/>&gt; Notes to Part V<br/>&gt; ---------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 33. In a neo-Gothic setting, we might relish the impurity of G#-D#&apos;<br/>as<br/>&gt; a stimulating touch of &quot;modal color&quot; at a location having a certain<br/>&gt; affinity to the diminished sixth or &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; G#-Eb. Might this<br/>&gt; much gentler and more &quot;domesticated&quot; counterpart with its 17-tET-<br/>like<br/>&gt; size be called a &quot;poodle fifth&quot;?</p><p>:  )</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 38. For a brief discussion of 7-flavor cadences in the e-based<br/>tuning,<br/>&gt; see &quot;A gentle introduction to neo-Gothic progressions,&quot; 1, Part 2C,<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16134">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16134</a>. In a forthcoming<br/>article<br/>&gt; on this tuning, I hope to discuss &quot;metachromatic&quot; sequences moving<br/>&gt; between manuals in often surprising ways.</p><p>This I will be eargerly awaiting! This would be a wonderful paper to<br/>have some audio examples to accompany the reading (let&apos;s do this!).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 39. For metallophone-like timbres, 27-tET (fifths ~711.11 cents,<br/>~9.16<br/>&gt; cents wide) can have a very pleasant effect in a neo-Gothic setting<br/>&gt; with its virtually pure 7:6 and 12:7 approximations (~266.67 cents,<br/>&gt; ~933.33 cents, only ~0.20 cents respectively narrow and wide), and a<br/>&gt; somewhat &quot;gamelan-like&quot; ambiance.</p><p>Intervals after my own heart!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>Paul H.

I&apos;m generally<br/>dubious of such a complex ratio, when the temperament can be defined using<br/>225:224 and 5120:5103.</p><p>&gt; As a JI system, this scheme therefore also belongs to the family of<br/>&gt; septimal schisma tunings and temperaments of a general kind described<br/>&gt; and advocated by Graham Breed[32], where one or more fifths in a<br/>&gt; Pythagorean chain is slightly widened in order to obtain or very<br/>&gt; closely approximate pure 7-based ratios.</p><p>Hey, there&apos;s my name!  I always pay attention when my name comes up.</p><p>That suggests I was describing tunings with fifths wider than Pythagorean.<br/> Although those tend to be the ones I advocate, it&apos;s 53-equal that&apos;s the<br/>borderline for the 7-based mapping.</p><p>&gt; To obtain pure 7:4 minor sevenths and 8:7 major seconds, formed from<br/>&gt; chains of 14 fifths up or down, we could temper each fifth by 1/14 of<br/>&gt; a 3.80-cent septimal schisma; for pure 7:6 minor thirds and 12:7 major<br/>&gt; sixths, by 1/15 septimal schisma; and for pure 9:7 major thirds and<br/>&gt; 14:9 minor sixths, by 1/16 septimal schisma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is a table of these regular temperaments:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Chain        Pure intervals      Fifth          Tempering<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; 14 fifths      8:7 / 7:4     ~702.227 cents   +~0.272 cents<br/>&gt; 15 fifths     12:7 / 7:6     ~702.209 cents   +~0.254 cents<br/>&gt; 16 fifths      9:7 / 14:9    ~702.193 cents   +~0.238 cents<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>That&apos;s neat.  I didn&apos;t realise that you could get fractional schisma<br/>temperaments this way.  The meantone equivalent would be the 50.7 cent<br/>septimal comma of 3^10:(2^13*7) or 59049/57344.  Then, 7/4 is just in<br/>1/10-septimal comma meantone.</p><p>&gt; Suppose we choose the middle alternative of a 1/15-septimal schisma<br/>&gt; temperament with pure 12:7 major sixths and 7:6 minor thirds; fifths<br/>&gt; and the other 7-based intervals of our table are alike impure by the<br/>&gt; amount of the temperament, about 0.25 cents, remaining &quot;virtually<br/>&gt; just.&quot;[34]</p><p>Although major seconds will be a half cent out from 9:8.</p><p>&gt; &gt;From a theoretical viewpoint, while our RAST approach leaves the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean intervals within each manual unaltered, our 1/15-schisma<br/>&gt; temperament causes very subtle changes in the global intonational<br/>&gt; fabric. Regular major thirds, for example, are slightly enlarged from<br/>&gt; a Pythagorean 81:64 (~407.82 cents) to around 408.83 cents, rather<br/>&gt; close to a ratio of 19:15 (~409.24 cents); usual diatonic semitones<br/>&gt; contract from a Pythagorean 256:243 (~90.22 cents) to around 88.96<br/>&gt; cents.[35]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In practice, the two systems seem musically synonymous, and it is an<br/>&gt; open question whether a performer at the 24-note keyboard would notice<br/>&gt; any difference of &quot;look and feel&quot; in these two schisma tunings with<br/>&gt; their kindred qualities of accuracy -- and intricacy.</p><p>I found a surprisingly large improvement in 7-limit chords as the tuning<br/>approaches 1/14-septimal schisma.  I think a performer would notice the<br/>difference.</p><p>&gt; From the viewpoint of the performer, either system is large and<br/>&gt; relatively intricate: 24 notes are needed to make 7-based intervals<br/>&gt; available at the same number of locations as their regular Pythagorean<br/>&gt; counterparts in a 12-note tuning, and septimal comma distinctions at<br/>&gt; once complicate and diversify the possible range of sonorities and<br/>&gt; progressions.</p><p>Yes, a meantone tuning can give you much simpler 7-based intervals  19<br/>notes of it go a long way.  However, it&apos;s a qualitatively different system<br/>melodically, so there&apos;s room in the world for both.</p><p>&gt; In conclusion, one&apos;s choice between a RAST approach and a regular<br/>&gt; schisma temperament may reflect one&apos;s conceptual taste for &quot;pure JI<br/>&gt; ratios&quot; (in theory!) versus pervasive regularity and symmetry; the<br/>&gt; musical kinship between these solutions may be more important than<br/>&gt; their theoretical differences.[36]</p><p>For me, &quot;conceptual taste&quot; doesn&apos;t enter into it.  I played with an<br/>almost-Pythagorean tuning for a long time, and was dissatisfied with<br/>7-limit chords in it.  Optimising the tuning really makes them sound a lot<br/>healthier.  (Keeping the chorus down helps as well.)  I&apos;m finding the same<br/>thing today with Kyma, so it probably isn&apos;t an artefact of tuning table<br/>inaccuracy.  I may look into this more closely.</p><p>Now for the footnotes.</p><p>&gt; 32. See <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/schismic.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/schismic.htm</a>. Since Graham<br/>&gt; Breed&apos;s discussion focuses mainly on systems combining ratios of 2-3-5<br/>&gt; or 2-3-5-7 or 2-3-5-7-11 (with a &quot;major third&quot; often suggesting 5:4),<br/>&gt; his viewpoint may be somewhat different from that involved in<br/>&gt; neo-Gothic systems based on ratios of 2-3-7 (with a &quot;major third&quot;<br/>&gt; typically suggesting 81:64 or 9:7). Here I use the term &quot;septimal<br/>&gt; schisma temperament&quot; rather narrowly to mean a regular temperament<br/>&gt; where the fifth is widened by around 1/14-1/16 of a septimal schisma<br/>&gt; to obtain near-pure ratios of 3 and 7, i.e. a temperament with fifths<br/>&gt; in the range of ~702.19-702.23 cents (~0.23-0.27 cents wide). Graham<br/>&gt; Breed favors a fifth at 79/135 octave (702.2222... cents, ~0.267 cents<br/>&gt; wide), virtually identical to a 1/14-septimal schisma temperament<br/>&gt; (pure 7:4 and 8:7).</p><p>I prefer the URL <a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/schismic.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/schismic.htm</a> although it<br/>points to the same site.  If I ever change ISPs, the <a href="http://cix.co.uk">cix.co.uk</a> links will<br/>break.</p><p>It happens that the best system for 2-3-7 ratios is also the best for<br/>2-3-5-7 ratios.  However, in theory it shouldn&apos;t make much difference<br/>whether you tune to that optimum or a more pragmatic near-Pythagorean<br/>tuning.  The worsening 7:4 should almost be compensated for by an<br/>improving 7:5.  However, in practice it makes quite a big difference, so I<br/>go for an easy to remember tuning near the optimum.</p><p>&gt; 35. The 1/15-septimal schisma tuning is located on the neo-Gothic<br/>&gt; spectrum of regular tunings about midway between Pythagorean with its<br/>&gt; pure 3:2 fifths at ~701.955 cents and 41-tET (fifths ~702.439 cents,<br/>&gt; ~0.484 cents wide). While small, the variances of this 1/15-schisma<br/>&gt; tuning from our RAST scheme might sometimes be highly desirable. For<br/>&gt; example, in the special sixth sonority with a near-11:8 &quot;superfourth&quot;<br/>&gt; between the two upper voices, e.g. B3-Eb4-G#^4 cadencing to A3-E4-A4<br/>&gt; (see Part IV, Section 4.3.2), this interval has a RAST tuning of<br/>&gt; 19683:14336 or ~548.77 cents, ~2.55 cents smaller than pure. In the<br/>&gt; 1/15-schisma tuning, it is ~550.80 cents, within ~0.52 cents of pure.<br/>&gt; For either system, incidentally, this very special superfourth unites<br/>&gt; the extreme notes of the 23-fifth chain, Eb-G#^.</p><p>Ah, the good old 23-fifth chain 11:8.  In 1/14-septimal schisma, it&apos;s only<br/>about 0.1 cents flat of pure.  Unfortunately, an 11:7 comes out as a<br/>37-fifth chain interval!</p><p>The other side of 41-equal, there&apos;s a simpler 18-fourth chain 11:8.  That<br/>would be C/-F# in my notation.  I think it&apos;s C^-Gb in Margo&apos;s.  And 11:7<br/>is a mere C-Ab in either system.  The optimal 11-limit tuning would be<br/>702.67 cents, where 11:6 and 12:11 are just.  Unfortunately, the C-Ab is<br/>still nearly 7 cents out from 11:7.</p><p>                      Graham</p></div><h3>Todd Wilcox &#x3C;twilcox@patriot.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2001 9:16:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;What other<br/>&gt; &gt;qualities of GM, if any, are required for these MIDI files?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you&apos;ve surmised, the bend range is important.

I&apos;m<br/>&gt; generally dubious of such a complex ratio, when the temperament can<br/>&gt; be defined using 225:224 and 5120:5103.</p><p>While after reading the remainder of your post I&apos;m not sure if this is<br/>still an issue, I should explain that the septimal schisma at its rather<br/>large ratio of 33554432:33480783 (~3.804 cents) isn&apos;t as formidable as<br/>it may appear.</p><p>It&apos;s simply the amount by which, for example, a minor seventh from a<br/>chain of 14 pure fourths up or fifths down differs from a pure 7:4. If<br/>we&apos;re addressing ratios of 2-3-7, then this is the relevant schisma;<br/>your ratios involve other factors such as 5 which would, of course, be<br/>relevant in a 7-limit system based on 2-3-5-7, for example.</p><p>Using the 3.80-cent schisma is thus the simplest approach in a 2-3-7<br/>system. In practice, of course, the complexity of the integer ratio is<br/>academic: it&apos;s a question of taking 3.80 cents and figuring the<br/>closest approximation on a given synthesizer&apos;s tuning table, for<br/>example (3/1024 octave for a 1024-tET synthesizer).</p><p>If we were hypothetically tuning the 24-note 2-3-7 JI system by ear,<br/>we actually wouldn&apos;t even need to know about this schisma or do any<br/>tempering at all: we just tune the first manual in Pythagorean; tune,<br/>say, a D on the second manual to a pure 7:6 below F on the first<br/>manual in the same octave; and tune the second manual in Pythagorean<br/>from there.</p><p>&gt;&gt; As a JI system, this scheme therefore also belongs to the family of<br/>&gt;&gt; septimal schisma tunings and temperaments of a general kind<br/>&gt;&gt; described and advocated by Graham Breed[32], where one or more<br/>&gt;&gt; fifths in a Pythagorean chain is slightly widened in order to<br/>&gt;&gt; obtain or very closely approximate pure 7-based ratios.</p><p>&gt; Hey, there&apos;s my name!  I always pay attention when my name comes up.</p><p>Actually, I feel like apologizing for rather understating your great<br/>contribution to my RAST (Rational Adaptive Schisma Tuning) solution<br/>for 2-3-7 JI, because your articles last summer really got me<br/>interested both in making those 7-based intervals _pure_, and in the<br/>septimal schisma as a key to the problem.</p><p>Please let me add that compared to the kinds of schisma tunings you<br/>discuss, mine is much simpler and less sophisticated, and addresses a<br/>much more rudimentary problem. If one is dealing with multiple prime<br/>factors (2-3-5-7 or 2-3-5-7-11), then your suggested schisma ratios<br/>and methods are indeed the relevant ones.</p><p>&gt; That suggests I was describing tunings with fifths wider than<br/>&gt; Pythagorean.  Although those tend to be the ones I advocate, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; 53-equal that&apos;s the borderline for the 7-based mapping.</p><p>From my 2-3-7 outlook, I would say that indeed 53-tET is satisfactory<br/>for yielding good approximations of 7 -- but that if we take<br/>Pythagorean (pure fifths) as the starting point, as it is for<br/>neo-Gothic, then 53-tET is moving in the wrong direction to improve<br/>7-based ratios, albeit ever so slightly. From a 7-limit perspective<br/>(2-3-5-7), of course, it is also slightly improving the 5-limit<br/>thirds.</p><p>Just to place this question in a bit of context: last summer, you were<br/>commenting that the comma in 53-tET (~22.64 cents, a tad narrower than<br/>the Pythagorean 23.46 cents) was a bit too small to be comfortable for<br/>you as a melodic inflection, so that you tended to favor leaning in<br/>the wide direction, where the comma gets larger. For example, it&apos;s<br/>~26.67 cents with your 1/14 septimal schisma tuning with the fifth at<br/>79/135 octave, and ~29.27 cents in 41-tET.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s neat.  I didn&apos;t realise that you could get fractional schisma<br/>&gt; temperaments this way.  The meantone equivalent would be the 50.7<br/>&gt; cent septimal comma of 3^10:(2^13*7) or 59049/57344.  Then, 7/4 is<br/>&gt; just in 1/10-septimal comma meantone.</p><p>This is a neat way of viewing things, and indeed 1/10 of this septimal<br/>comma gives us a temperament of the fifth on the meantone side by<br/>about 5.07 cents, close to 1/4-comma meantone (~5.38 cents) and even<br/>closer to 31-tET (~5.18 cents).</p><p>&gt;&gt; Suppose we choose the middle alternative of a 1/15-septimal schisma<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament with pure 12:7 major sixths and 7:6 minor thirds;<br/>&gt;&gt; fifths and the other 7-based intervals of our table are alike<br/>&gt;&gt; impure by the amount of the temperament, about 0.25 cents,<br/>&gt;&gt; remaining &quot;virtually just.&quot;[34]</p><p>&gt; Although major seconds will be a half cent out from 9:8.</p><p>One advantage of the RAST approach -- just &quot;virtually temper&quot; one<br/>fifth by the full 3.80-cent schisma, and have done -- is that apart<br/>from usual Pythagorean-like intervals with that fifth in their chains,<br/>we keep the familiar 3-based ratios pure, including all the 9:8&apos;s<br/>within either keyboard.</p><p>&gt; I found a surprisingly large improvement in 7-limit chords as the<br/>&gt; tuning approaches 1/14-septimal schisma.  I think a performer would<br/>&gt; notice the difference.</p><p>This is interesting, and I wonder how 1/14 schisma vs. 1/15 schisma<br/>might work out for 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 (what might Paul<br/>Erlich&apos;s &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; say?).</p><p>With a RAST approach, all these ratios are pure -- although we&apos;re<br/>talking about minute variations here.</p><p>&gt; Yes, a meantone tuning can give you much simpler 7-based intervals<br/>&gt; 19 notes of it go a long way.  However, it&apos;s a qualitatively<br/>&gt; different system melodically, so there&apos;s room in the world for both.</p><p>While the meantone indeed offers a shorter chain of fifths for these<br/>intervals, as Dave Keenan points out also, I&apos;d say the choice might be<br/>one between a Gothic style where the regular Pythagorean intervals are<br/>natural, and a Renaissance style where the meantone intervals are<br/>natural -- melodically and vertically.</p><p>In a Gothic setting, pure or near-pure fifths are great; in a<br/>Renaissance or later setting, that 5-odd-cents of temperament (in the<br/>narrow direction) also serves the very useful purpose of giving us<br/>pure or near-pure thirds at or close to 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>&gt; For me, &quot;conceptual taste&quot; doesn&apos;t enter into it.  I played with an<br/>&gt; almost-Pythagorean tuning for a long time, and was dissatisfied with<br/>&gt; 7-limit chords in it.  Optimising the tuning really makes them sound<br/>&gt; a lot healthier.  (Keeping the chorus down helps as well.)  I&apos;m<br/>&gt; finding the same thing today with Kyma, so it probably isn&apos;t an<br/>&gt; artefact of tuning table inaccuracy.  I may look into this more<br/>&gt; closely.</p><p>Here my &quot;conceptual taste&quot; remark was directed to the rather narrow<br/>question of whether to seek those pure 7-based intervals by stretching<br/>a single fifth the full schisma (RAST), or with a regular temperament<br/>(e.g. 1/14 of the schisma for a pure 7:4).</p><p>One thing I might have added is that for synthesizers, if one is going<br/>for pure ratios as the ideal, the tuning table and the &quot;nanotempering&quot;<br/>needed to fit its steps can make a difference.</p><p>For example, 1024-tET gives almost pure fifths, but the closest<br/>approximation of any of the regular schisma temperaments we&apos;ve been<br/>discussing is to widen one fifth in every four by 1/1024 octave (~1.17<br/>cents). If we look at the resulting chain of 23 fifths, we find<br/>something like this:</p><p> |-----------------------------------------|<br/>   s  s  s  L  s  s  s  L  s  s  s  L  s  s  s  L  s  s  s  L  s  s  s<br/>          |------------------------------------------|</p><p>Note over a chain of 14 fifths, we want 11 almost-pure (s) fifths and<br/>three large (L) fifths, for a total correction of 3 tuning units<br/>(~3.51 cents, the best approximation of the schisma). However, what we<br/>get are some chains with 3 L and some with 4 L, so that we can&apos;t use<br/>the most accurate approximation for all these intervals.</p><p>With a RAST approach, we temper one fifth by 3 tuning units, and<br/>optimize all 7-based intervals (including the 7:4&apos;s) to within around<br/>0.32 cents of pure, since all these intervals will have that one fifth<br/>in their chain.</p><p>Of course, as the phrase goes, this is a &quot;device-specific&quot; issue. If<br/>we had a synthesizer in 1350-tET, then a regular 1/14-schisma<br/>temperament with all fifths at 790 units would be the way to go.</p><p>&gt; I prefer the URL <a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/schismic.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/schismic.htm</a> although<br/>&gt; it points to the same site.  If I ever change ISPs, the <a href="http://cix.co.uk">cix.co.uk</a><br/>&gt; links will break.</p><p>Thank you for this information, of which I&apos;ll take note.</p><p>&gt; Ah, the good old 23-fifth chain 11:8.  In 1/14-septimal schisma,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s only about 0.1 cents flat of pure.  Unfortunately, an 11:7<br/>&gt; comes out as a 37-fifth chain interval!</p><p>Yes, 1/14-septimal schisma is right at an optimal 11:8 point. If we<br/>want both 11:7 and 11:8, then the region around 46-tET (pure 14:11<br/>major thirds and 11:7 minor sevenths) is one possibility. We get 11:7<br/>as the regular minor sixth -- a bit languid in a very pleasant way in<br/>neo-Gothic -- and 11:8 as the &quot;Wolf fourth&quot; of 11 fifths up,<br/>e.g. Eb-G# -- a chain 12 fifths shorter than in the Pythagorean zone.</p><p>For a pure 11:7 (and 14:11) we have fifths at ~704.38 cents (~2.42<br/>cents wide), just a tad wider than 46-tET. For a pure 11:8 Wolf fourth<br/>or augmented third, we need to go just a tad further than the<br/>&quot;e-based&quot; tuning at 704.61 cents, in fact ~704.665 cents (2.71 cents<br/>wide). With the e-based tuning, our 11:7 is about 0.91 cents narrow,<br/>and our 11:8 about 0.64 cents narrow.</p><p>&gt; The other side of 41-equal, there&apos;s a simpler 18-fourth chain 11:8.<br/>&gt; That would be C/-F# in my notation.  I think it&apos;s C^-Gb in Margo&apos;s.<br/>&gt; And 11:7 is a mere C-Ab in either system.  The optimal 11-limit<br/>&gt; tuning would be 702.67 cents, where 11:6 and 12:11 are just.<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, the C-Ab is still nearly 7 cents out from 11:7.</p><p>Yes, I find this fifth for the pure 18-fourth 11:8 at around 702.7046<br/>cents, about halfway between Pythagorean and 29-tET, and I could<br/>indeed describe the interval as A^-Eb, for example, a diminished fifth<br/>less comma (6 + 12 fourths up). From your viewpoint, I suspect, the<br/>regular diminished fifth only about 1.26 cents wide of a pure 7:5 is<br/>also an attraction.</p><p>By the way, to wander into the general neighborhood of Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>22-tET country, we get a diminished fifth of 11:8 with a fifth of<br/>around 708.11 cents (~6.16 cents wide), or roughly a cent less<br/>tempering than 22-tET. This is maybe around the middle of the &quot;optimal<br/>paultone zone.&quot;</p><p>One rational approximation of this fifth is 140:93 (~708.15 cents).</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2001 8:55:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s the origin of &quot;the septimal schisma&quot; I suppose.

I<br/>didn&apos;t understand its significance until I read your post.  I still<br/>have a minor gripe with it in other contexts, but it&apos;s not that<br/>important.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s simply the amount by which, for example, a minor seventh from a<br/>&gt; chain of 14 pure fourths up or fifths down differs from a pure 7:4.<br/>If<br/>&gt; we&apos;re addressing ratios of 2-3-7, then this is the relevant schisma;<br/>&gt; your ratios involve other factors such as 5 which would, of course,<br/>be<br/>&gt; relevant in a 7-limit system based on 2-3-5-7, for example.</p><p>This highlights the different ways we view these systems, you see.  I<br/>start with my tempered fifth and don&apos;t know or care what 14 pure ones<br/>would have been.</p><p>&gt; Using the 3.80-cent schisma is thus the simplest approach in a 2-3-7<br/>&gt; system. In practice, of course, the complexity of the integer ratio<br/>is<br/>&gt; academic: it&apos;s a question of taking 3.80 cents and figuring the<br/>&gt; closest approximation on a given synthesizer&apos;s tuning table, for<br/>&gt; example (3/1024 octave for a 1024-tET synthesizer).</p><p>And that&apos;s another thing.  When you take the 5s out, this is *the*<br/>septimal schisma.  To reflect this, I suggest it be called the<br/>&quot;Pythagorean-septimal schisma&quot; or &quot;2-3-7 schisma&quot;.</p><p>&gt; If we were hypothetically tuning the 24-note 2-3-7 JI system by ear,<br/>&gt; we actually wouldn&apos;t even need to know about this schisma or do any<br/>&gt; tempering at all: we just tune the first manual in Pythagorean;<br/>tune,<br/>&gt; say, a D on the second manual to a pure 7:6 below F on the first<br/>&gt; manual in the same octave; and tune the second manual in Pythagorean<br/>&gt; from there.</p><p>Yes, for ear tuning you&apos;d work with whatever pure intervals were<br/>relevant.  The fact that these intervals are so close to just means<br/>that you don&apos;t need to worry about tempering them exactly, and the<br/>tuning as a whole will take care of itself.</p><p>But I find it conceptually easier to explain a temperament without<br/>using the complicated &quot;bridge&quot; intervals.  I think of schismic<br/>temperament as being about commas.  In the 5-limit case, the<br/>Pythagorean and syntonic commas are equivalent.  The septimal comma<br/>64:63 then joins the party.  If 81:80 decides to leave, that&apos;s no<br/>problem!</p><p>I don&apos;t even know the ratio for a Pythagorean comma offhand.  I could<br/>work it out, of course.  But all I need to know it that it&apos;s the<br/>amount by which 6 whole tones of 9:8 are sharp of a 2:1 octave.</p><p>So when you&apos;re tuning your keyboard, you&apos;ll find an interval that is a<br/>comma flat of the Pythagorean minor third.  As all commas are equal,<br/>you know that interval approximates 7:6.  So, within the natural<br/>imprecision of acoustic instruments, you&apos;re free to tune it likewise.</p><p>A small bit of mathematics is needed to know that that interval is a<br/>7:6.  The Pythagorean minor third is three octave-reduced fourths.<br/>The denominator then is 27.  The numerator must be a power of two, and<br/>32 fits the bill.  But we don&apos;t even need to know that.  call it 1:27.<br/> Flatten it by 64:63, or 1:63, and we get 63:27 which cancels down to<br/>7:3.  And that&apos;s an octave equivalent of 7:6.</p><p>So, when I make casual remarks about &quot;the septimal schisma&quot; being<br/>over-complex, part of my argument is that we don&apos;t need a septimal<br/>schisma at all.  Only a septimal comma.  Which also means I don&apos;t care<br/>much what gets called &quot;the septimal schisma&quot; as I rarely talk about<br/>&quot;schismas&quot; only &quot;schismic temperaments&quot;.</p><p>The situation may be different if you were to tune 13 pure commas and<br/>decide the next one should be tempered.  But I&apos;d still rather say &quot;13<br/>pure commas&quot; than whatever ratio it turns out to be.</p><p>This also shows my preference for small integers over complex ratios.<br/> As I often use matrix algebra to manipulate those small integers, my<br/>idea of &quot;simplicity&quot; may not tally with that of the general<br/>population, but there you go.</p><p>&gt; Actually, I feel like apologizing for rather understating your great<br/>&gt; contribution to my RAST (Rational Adaptive Schisma Tuning) solution<br/>&gt; for 2-3-7 JI, because your articles last summer really got me<br/>&gt; interested both in making those 7-based intervals _pure_, and in the<br/>&gt; septimal schisma as a key to the problem.</p><p>Thanks for that.  Given your high standard of scholarship, I feel<br/>slightly honoured that you&apos;re paying me any attention at all.</p><p>&gt; &gt; That suggests I was describing tunings with fifths wider than<br/>&gt; &gt; Pythagorean.  Although those tend to be the ones I advocate, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; 53-equal that&apos;s the borderline for the 7-based mapping.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From my 2-3-7 outlook, I would say that indeed 53-tET is<br/>satisfactory<br/>&gt; for yielding good approximations of 7 -- but that if we take<br/>&gt; Pythagorean (pure fifths) as the starting point, as it is for<br/>&gt; neo-Gothic, then 53-tET is moving in the wrong direction to improve<br/>&gt; 7-based ratios, albeit ever so slightly. From a 7-limit perspective<br/>&gt; (2-3-5-7), of course, it is also slightly improving the 5-limit<br/>&gt; thirds.</p><p>The thing about 53 is that, if the fifth gets any flatter, the best<br/>7-limit approximation doesn&apos;t equate the Pythagorean and septimal<br/>commas.  So the general &quot;septimal schisma&quot; concept is only valid for<br/>tunings with a fifth wider than that in 53-equal.  As an example,<br/>118-equal is a good 7-limit tuning (may even be consistent) and is a<br/>schismic temperament, but it isn&apos;t a &quot;septimal schisma&quot; temperament.</p><p>In the same way, 12-equal is the borderline between meantone and<br/>schismic temperaments.  So &quot;meantone&quot; would usually refer to scales<br/>generated by a fifth flatter than 7/12 octaves (although the<br/>definition is contentious :) and &quot;schismic&quot; to those with fifths sharp<br/>of 5/12 octaves.</p><p>I &quot;advocate&quot; sharper fifths for the reasons you outline.  Including<br/>the fatter comma:</p><p>&gt;Just to place this question in a bit of context: last summer, you<br/>were<br/>&gt;commenting that the comma in 53-tET (~22.64 cents, a tad narrower<br/>than<br/>&gt;the Pythagorean 23.46 cents) was a bit too small to be comfortable<br/>for<br/>&gt;you as a melodic inflection, so that you tended to favor leaning in<br/>&gt;the wide direction, where the comma gets larger. For example, it&apos;s<br/>&gt;~26.67 cents with your 1/14 septimal schisma tuning with the fifth at<br/>&gt;79/135 octave, and ~29.27 cents in 41-tET.</p><p>Another way of thinking about this is the number of commas that make<br/>up an octave.  1/14 septimal schisma tuning has around 45 commas to<br/>the octave.  I tune it to exactly 45.  There are around 51.15<br/>Pythagorean commas to an octave, and I found that to be wide enough.<br/>So the cutoff is between 1/51 and 1/53 octaves.  It would follow that<br/>64- and 50-equal should also be okay if the single steps are audible.<br/> Although the exact cutoff will likely be a matter of personal taste.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Suppose we choose the middle alternative of a 1/15-septimal<br/>schisma<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; temperament with pure 12:7 major sixths and 7:6 minor thirds;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fifths and the other 7-based intervals of our table are alike<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; impure by the amount of the temperament, about 0.25 cents,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; remaining &quot;virtually just.&quot;[34]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Although major seconds will be a half cent out from 9:8.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One advantage of the RAST approach -- just &quot;virtually temper&quot; one<br/>&gt; fifth by the full 3.80-cent schisma, and have done -- is that apart<br/>&gt; from usual Pythagorean-like intervals with that fifth in their<br/>chains,<br/>&gt; we keep the familiar 3-based ratios pure, including all the 9:8&apos;s<br/>&gt; within either keyboard.</p><p>Ah, so that&apos;s another subtlety I hadn&apos;t taken account of.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I found a surprisingly large improvement in 7-limit chords as the<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning approaches 1/14-septimal schisma.  I think a performer<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; notice the difference.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is interesting, and I wonder how 1/14 schisma vs. 1/15 schisma<br/>&gt; might work out for 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24 (what might Paul<br/>&gt; Erlich&apos;s &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; say?).</p><p>If I remember these, I could try them.  Although the difference<br/>between 1/14 and 1/15 schisma is likely to be much smaller than<br/>between either and Pythagorean intonation.  12:18 and 14:21 are both<br/>fifths, right?  And 12:14 is 6:7.  So these are fifth pairs a subminor<br/>third apart.</p><p>Usually I go with a 4:5:6:7 for testing, or 4:5:6:7:8 if my fingers<br/>stretch far enough.</p><p>I have done some more tests as well.  I set up a MIDI knob to fade<br/>between my near-enough optimal 1/45 octave comma, and 41-equal.  Then<br/>I extrapolated to take me past Pythagorean.</p><p>Now, when I tried it that first evening, I found that the<br/>near-Pythagorean tuning wasn&apos;t as bad as I remembered.  Or, at least,<br/>it ceased to be as the experiment progressed.  Next morning, the<br/>sourness returned, so I think it&apos;s that I was coming to recognize the<br/>7-limit harmonies and unconsciously make allowances for their<br/>mistuning.</p><p>This is something we have to watch out for.  The average audience<br/>member will be less familiar with 7-limit harmony than I am.  So, if<br/>you hit them with mistuned 7-limit chords, the first impression will<br/>be &quot;yeek, that&apos;s out of tune!&quot;  You may think your intonation&apos;s fine<br/>if you&apos;ve been desensitised during rehearsals.  So be careful.</p><p>Anyway, the results.  There is some kind of cut-off where the tuning<br/>gets 110% of the way from 41 to 135.  I&apos;m not sure exactly where this<br/>falls, but it sounds uncomfortably close to 1/16-schisma.  Going the<br/>other side of 41-equal isn&apos;t such a problem.  The chords become<br/>blurred, but not sour.  So, where there&apos;s an uncertainty about how<br/>accurate an instrument may be tuned, I suggest something like<br/>1/14-schisma, or somewhere towards 41-equal, to be on the safe side.</p><p>7:9:11 chords, using the simplest approximation for 7:11, start to<br/>sound great half way towards 41-equal.  They aren&apos;t so sensitive to<br/>tuning, so either side of 41= is okay, althought the theoretical<br/>optimum is the far side of 41= to the 7-limit optimum.  If the<br/>equalness of 41 simplifies anything for you, go for it.</p><p>This is all done with filtered sawtooth waveforms.  Raising the filter<br/>is good for 7:9:11 chords.</p><p>&gt; With a RAST approach, all these ratios are pure -- although we&apos;re<br/>&gt; talking about minute variations here.</p><p>In practical terms, it would be hardware-dependent.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, a meantone tuning can give you much simpler 7-based intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; 19 notes of it go a long way.  However, it&apos;s a qualitatively<br/>&gt; &gt; different system melodically, so there&apos;s room in the world for<br/>both.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the meantone indeed offers a shorter chain of fifths for these<br/>&gt; intervals, as Dave Keenan points out also, I&apos;d say the choice might<br/>be<br/>&gt; one between a Gothic style where the regular Pythagorean intervals<br/>are<br/>&gt; natural, and a Renaissance style where the meantone intervals are<br/>&gt; natural -- melodically and vertically.</p><p>I think a lot of the neo-Gothic concepts would work in meantone.  You<br/>still have good-enough approximations to the 2-3-7 intervals.</p><p>&gt; In a Gothic setting, pure or near-pure fifths are great; in a<br/>&gt; Renaissance or later setting, that 5-odd-cents of temperament (in<br/>the<br/>&gt; narrow direction) also serves the very useful purpose of giving us<br/>&gt; pure or near-pure thirds at or close to 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>It happens that 1/4-comma meantone is both the optimal minimax 5-limit<br/>temperament, and the same optimum for the 7-limit.  So there isn&apos;t the<br/>7-5 dichotomy you get in schismic temperament where the two are<br/>optimised either side of Pythagorean.  However, in meantone, the<br/>fifths are always bad relative to schismic if you optimize to either<br/>of these limits.</p><p>I think the fifths in, say, 31-equal are good enough for trines to<br/>function as stable chords.  I find the tempering to be noticeable but<br/>tolerable.  7-based chords should be able to resolve onto trines the<br/>same as they do in a schismic temperament.</p><p>The near-pure thirds are something of a red-herring.  Yes, either 5:4<br/>or 6:5 can be pure in meantone, but so can either 7:6 or 7:4.  The<br/>trade-off between meantone and schismic is the same whether you take<br/>2-3-5 or 2-3-7.  Schismic temperament will give you much purer<br/>intervals, but with a more complex scale.</p><p>I&apos;m interested in how neo-Gothic would work in meantone.  I haven&apos;t<br/>followed the details of the theory as you outlined it.  I tend to<br/>switch off when I see harmonic progressions discussed, because I&apos;m not<br/>familiar with the traditional theory.  Perhaps a summary of<br/>characteristic progressions would be useful, or I could go back<br/>through the archives.</p><p>If enough intervals with 7 and 11 are involved, it may be possible to<br/>remove the Pythagorean ones altogether.  So an 11-limit aware meantone<br/>notation could be used for variable pitched instruments.</p><p>I&apos;m also wondering how much Common Practice harmony could work with<br/>9-limit intervals.  The occasional 6:7:9 minor triad, or 21:20 leading<br/>tone, could do it a power of good.</p><p>&gt; Here my &quot;conceptual taste&quot; remark was directed to the rather narrow<br/>&gt; question of whether to seek those pure 7-based intervals by<br/>stretching<br/>&gt; a single fifth the full schisma (RAST), or with a regular<br/>temperament<br/>&gt; (e.g. 1/14 of the schisma for a pure 7:4).</p><p>Ah, right.  So this is like a well-temperament for schismic scales.<br/>As such, it would favor some keys over others.  Although mostly, yes,<br/>likely a conceptual difference.</p><p>&gt; One thing I might have added is that for synthesizers, if one is<br/>going<br/>&gt; for pure ratios as the ideal, the tuning table and the<br/>&quot;nanotempering&quot;<br/>&gt; needed to fit its steps can make a difference.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, 1024-tET gives almost pure fifths, but the closest<br/>&gt; approximation of any of the regular schisma temperaments we&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; discussing is to widen one fifth in every four by 1/1024 octave<br/>(~1.17<br/>&gt; cents). If we look at the resulting chain of 23 fifths, we find<br/>&gt; something like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  |-----------------------------------------|<br/>&gt;    s  s  s  L  s  s  s  L  s  s  s  L  s  s  s  L  s  s  s  L  s  s<br/> s<br/>&gt;           |------------------------------------------|<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note over a chain of 14 fifths, we want 11 almost-pure (s) fifths<br/>and<br/>&gt; three large (L) fifths, for a total correction of 3 tuning units<br/>&gt; (~3.51 cents, the best approximation of the schisma). However, what<br/>we<br/>&gt; get are some chains with 3 L and some with 4 L, so that we can&apos;t use<br/>&gt; the most accurate approximation for all these intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With a RAST approach, we temper one fifth by 3 tuning units, and<br/>&gt; optimize all 7-based intervals (including the 7:4&apos;s) to within<br/>around<br/>&gt; 0.32 cents of pure, since all these intervals will have that one<br/>fifth<br/>&gt; in their chain.</p><p>Yes, that sounds like a good approach, if you want to consider such<br/>small details.  However, I caution against making too many assumptions<br/>about the way synthesizers do their tuning.  You may know the<br/>precision, but not the accuracy.  For example, if the tuning is with<br/>1024 steps to the octave, those steps may not all be equal.  So you<br/>might have to do a lot of experimentation to fit the tuning to the<br/>hardware.  I prefer to choose a temperament that is likely to fail<br/>gracefully however the precise implementation turns out.</p><p>If the tuning is done relative to a tonic, you&apos;ll probably find it<br/>ends up as some RAST like that when the tuning table&apos;s defined whether<br/>or not you oversaw the process.</p><p>&gt; Of course, as the phrase goes, this is a &quot;device-specific&quot; issue. If<br/>&gt; we had a synthesizer in 1350-tET, then a regular 1/14-schisma<br/>&gt; temperament with all fifths at 790 units would be the way to go.</p><p>You only need 135-tET for that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Ah, the good old 23-fifth chain 11:8.  In 1/14-septimal schisma,<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s only about 0.1 cents flat of pure.  Unfortunately, an 11:7<br/>&gt; &gt; comes out as a 37-fifth chain interval!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, 1/14-septimal schisma is right at an optimal 11:8 point. If we<br/>&gt; want both 11:7 and 11:8, then the region around 46-tET (pure 14:11<br/>&gt; major thirds and 11:7 minor sevenths) is one possibility. We get<br/>11:7<br/>&gt; as the regular minor sixth -- a bit languid in a very pleasant way<br/>in<br/>&gt; neo-Gothic -- and 11:8 as the &quot;Wolf fourth&quot; of 11 fifths up,<br/>&gt; e.g. Eb-G# -- a chain 12 fifths shorter than in the Pythagorean<br/>zone.</p><p>I don&apos;t like comparisons to 46-equal in this context, because it<br/>belongs to a different family of temperaments, which have different<br/>tuning considerations.</p><p>In schismic terms, the 2-3-7 starts to suffer when you optimize this<br/>11:7.  But 41-equal works well enough, so this is one way to think<br/>about the 11-limit in 41-equal.</p><p>12 note well temperaments work as they do because some parts of the<br/>keyboard favour thirds, and some fifths.  This compromise comes from<br/>the ideal tunings for 3:2 and 5:4 being either side of 12-equal.  In<br/>the same way, a 41 note RAST might balance the 3 and 7 on one side,<br/>and the 11 on the other.  Perhaps you could look at this in the light<br/>of your theories.  (Or perhaps you already have.)</p><p>&gt; Yes, I find this fifth for the pure 18-fourth 11:8 at around<br/>702.7046<br/>&gt; cents, about halfway between Pythagorean and 29-tET, and I could<br/>&gt; indeed describe the interval as A^-Eb, for example, a diminished<br/>fifth<br/>&gt; less comma (6 + 12 fourths up). From your viewpoint, I suspect, the<br/>&gt; regular diminished fifth only about 1.26 cents wide of a pure 7:5 is<br/>&gt; also an attraction.</p><p>The pure 7:5 isn&apos;t that important, because the other 9-limit intervals<br/>will be so far out.</p><p>In general, it looks like 5 and 11 don&apos;t go together.  In the same<br/>octave, they compare as 10 and 11.  So a chord using both implies an<br/>11:10, which is uncomfortably small, probably within the critical<br/>band.  The occasional 15 might turn up, but it&apos;d have to be with a 21<br/>to give a 7:5, and then you have 21:22.  As the tuning&apos;s optimized for<br/>chords with 11 in them, a 7:5 isn&apos;t likely to be at all important.  In<br/>this case leaving out 5 altogether looks like a good idea.  So we&apos;re<br/>in agreement!</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2001 6:35:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi John,</p><p>I wonder if you&apos;ve tried adaptive tuning for C.P.E.Bach?</p><p>With all the pure triads, and his transparent and very<br/>mellow &quot;laid back&quot; style, I think it would sound nice adaptively tuned<br/>to 5-limit.</p><p>I have a flute + piano sonata that I try out on the recorder,<br/>and I&apos;ve been practicing the recorder part with just intonation C major<br/>and G major chords today, and it sounds nice.

If all the right notes are played, but the speed<br/>varies from the original recording, that would be less of a problem<br/>as it wouldn&apos;t add any tracks or anything to it, but just retune the notes as they<br/>are played.</p><p>Would just need to go:</p><p>&quot;<br/>expecting an A at some time in the future as the next note - here it<br/>comes, so it needs to be pitch bent by ....</p><p>Now expecting a Bb,...<br/>&quot;</p><p>To take account of chords, would need to do something like<br/>&quot;Expecting a C and an E in some order for the next 2 notes&quot;</p><p>- maybe a look ahead buffer of maybe a dozen or so notes + their<br/>tunings would be the way to do it, and one would just use the next<br/>one in the list with the right midi note number.</p><p>With that sort of approach, and if one doesn&apos;t try to adaptively tune<br/>at all if one loses ones place, could be fairly robust and simple, and not<br/>demand much on the play back program.</p><p>Ideally one would want to integrate it with a program that could show the<br/>position in the score as one played, as that would make the setting and<br/>placing of cue points much easier and more intuitive I expect.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure how that might work - I&apos;d love to write a microtonal<br/>score editor, but that is so much work to contemplate, and at present I&apos;m using<br/>a standard score editor (NWC) with the output retuned using FTS,<br/>which works rather well.</p><p>Hope someone gets inspired to write a purpose built score editor some day!</p><p>FTS does have a very basic kind of &quot;score&quot; that it shows, but it isn&apos;t<br/>that far developed, and I think perhaps not up to this at present.</p><p>One way to get it started would be to start with something reasonably<br/>simple that actually worked and was interesting and worthwhile for<br/>players to experiment with, and didn&apos;t take much in the way of programming.</p><p>I&apos;ll keep it in mind.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2001 4:44:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi John,</p><p>&gt; Understood.

His work made a very strong impression<br/>on me, at a time when I was particularly impressionable.</p><p>His graduation piece for Manhattan School of Music, the<br/>marimba concerto _Dialogues II_, really knocked my socks off...<br/>and he dismisses it as &quot;juvenilia&quot; now.  My roomate at the<br/>time, Dan Palkowski, was hired by Rand to copy the parts for<br/>the performance, and I ended up with the copy of the manuscript<br/>score, which I still have and treasure.  We had an unusually<br/>cold winter here in San Diego this year, and when I told Rand<br/>a couple of months ago that I had the score, he suggested I<br/>&quot;hold on to it for use as kindling on one of those cold nights&quot;...<br/>his humility is not only notable, but funny too.</p><p>Rand was &quot;volunteered&quot; by Elias Tanenbaum to set up the computer<br/>interface for the Electronic Music Studio at Manhattan, back<br/>in 1980.  Everything had been analog up to that time.  The<br/>computer was the awesome (I&apos;m being facetious here) Commodore<br/>Pet.  Rand wrote the interface in Machine Language, which means<br/>pages and pages of 5-digit numbers.  Dan and I would hang out<br/>in the studio with Rand until 3:00 in the morning, helping<br/>him out by reading the numbers to him as he typed them in.<br/>That&apos;s mainly how we became friends.  He was always impressed<br/>by my compositions too (particularly _Romeo&apos;s Death_), so I<br/>guess we&apos;re a &quot;mutual admiration society&quot;.</p><p>We unfortunately only knew each other for one year, because<br/>Rand was a senior the year that I was a freshman.  He came<br/>out to California right after Manhattan, studied at Cal Arts,<br/>and became closely associated with Morton Subotnick.  He&apos;s been<br/>teaching composition on the music faculty at UCSD for 14 years,<br/>and held the rotating music department chair for a few years a<br/>little while back.  (Microtonalist and Ben Johnston student<br/>John Fonville is the current chair.)

I am working with Ben on his notation, among other things, as we speak<br/>(write? :). We were discussing this yesterday. To the best of my<br/>understanding if you base the lattice off a one dimensional system you have<br/>to notate whether you want a just third or not(meaning 5/4 against 1/1),<br/>adding to the complexity of the notated score(correct me if this is not quite<br/>accurate) In other words C = 1/1, 3/2  = G, and 5/4 = E -. The minus makes<br/>this more complicated on the score then with Ben&apos;s notation in the same<br/>situation.</p><p>On the other hand, yes, a two dimensional lattice is more complex than a one<br/>dimensional, but the same chord is less complex notationally. C = 1/1, G =<br/>3/2, E = 5/4. No minus is required. I&apos;m sure to most people on this list this<br/>is not new stuff, but I&apos;m just attempting to show a brief comparison. I see<br/>this as a give or take. It would seem good to understand both points of view,<br/>but the choice of what notation to use doesn&apos;t seem as important as just<br/>working on the sound of the intervals or the ear training aspect of<br/>microtonality in general, no matter what system you are working in. For<br/>another point of view, with a similar idea, here is an excerpt from an<br/>article by Adam Silverman entitled &quot;Notation Styles for Microtonal Just<br/>Intonation.&quot; (page 19) (sorry if you all have already read this - and alot of<br/>this info really comes from this source)</p><p>The primary advantage of of Wolf&apos;s notation is that it provides a consistency<br/>of accidental in chromatic music that wanders freely from one limit to<br/>another.

This Silverman article talks about it some, and Ben has some<br/>articles he wrote that discuss either the notation or other general JI topics<br/>which might be helpful if your trying to get to know his notation. I think<br/>some of this stuff is in perspectives in the 60&apos;s. There is also an article<br/>about his fourth quartet(not written by him), 70&apos;s?, that MIGHT discuss some<br/>of it. (I haven&apos;t read that one yet so no promises) Lets see, what else.<br/>There is a masters thesis written by one of his students which discusses his<br/>notation(if you want to try and read it I will se if I can find the name for<br/>you - I&apos;ve read it but I forget who wrote it!). Also there is a copy of<br/>&quot;Daphne of the Dunes&quot; floating around which has partch&apos;s notation translated<br/>into Bens. This might be helpful if you know Partch&apos;s notation,at least his<br/>notation at that time, well but not Ben&apos;s. This was done by Glenn Hackbarth.<br/>Or there are scores available and they might be helpful in and of themselves.<br/>I will ask Ben on friday to see if I forgot any others that might be useful.<br/>Also if you are want it I could throw a little list together for you?</p><p>Cheers hopefully this helps some,</p><p>Andy Stefik</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2001 12:09:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph!<br/>            If you will notice that the notation that Erv Wilson has proposed in Xenharmonikon and<br/>elsewhere can have the same bias as Johnson. The difference is that Erv notion implies that the<br/>scale being used in a Constant Structure. From that point, the notation is based on the melodic<br/>consistency (or linear series) of the tuning as opposed to the harmonic, not that this necessarily<br/>an opposition. The further advantage of his notation is that the logic holds true from tuning to<br/>tuning and is consistent with a Bosanquet keyboard. Not perfect, if such a thing was possible, it<br/>still is the only keyboard construction that offers any promise for moving forward. Of course we<br/>can all sit around and reinvent the wheel as many times as possible even though it was sitting in<br/>front of us 25 years ago. Also a a learning tool it far surpasses in simplicity the use of<br/>matrixes to see the unison vectors in any tuning. One has only to learn the basic template in a<br/>tuning and visually pick them out. Also when taking a given structure (such as a diamond) and<br/>wanting to fill it out until it forms a constant structure it is easy and simple to see what tones<br/>can be added. Matrixes are not simpler of doing this at all. One picture is worth a 100 words or<br/>in this case, numbers.</p><p><a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Of course, Johnson&apos;s system, if I understand it correctly, is VERY<br/>&gt; predicated on a C-major just tonality and, additionally, BEGINS the<br/>&gt; alteration process from what is ALREADY a two-dimensional rather than<br/>&gt; a one-dimensional lattice...  adding to the &quot;complexity.&quot;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2001 9:06:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JoJoBuBu@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22332">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/22332</a></p><p>&gt; Hi.

What do you intend by drawing the distinction?<br/>The Bosanquet layout ensures the two are not in opposition.</p><p>&gt; The further advantage of his notation is that the logic<br/>&gt; holds true from tuning to<br/>&gt; tuning and is consistent with a Bosanquet keyboard.</p><p>Of course it&apos;s consistent with a Bosanquet keyboard, it&apos;s designed for a<br/>Bosanquet keyboard.  It certainly is not consistent from tuning to tuning.<br/> In positive notation, a 4:5:6 triad is C E- G.  In negative notation it&apos;s<br/>C E G.  That&apos;s an inconsistency and it&apos;s a problem.</p><p>&gt; Not perfect, if<br/>&gt; such a thing was possible, it<br/>&gt; still is the only keyboard construction that offers any promise for<br/>&gt; moving forward.</p><p>What do you mean the only construction.  You said before:  &quot;One of the<br/>things that really got Erv excited about Hanson&apos; s keyboard is that it<br/>handles 72 where as the Bosanquet does not.&quot;</p><p>So Bosanquet can&apos;t handle 72.  Whereas a keyboard constructed around a<br/>10+1 &quot;Miracle&quot; scale could, along with 31 and 41.

I am working with Ben on his notation, among other things, as<br/>we speak (write? :). We were discussing this yesterday. To the best<br/>of my  understanding if you base the lattice off a one dimensional<br/>system you have to notate whether you want a just third or not<br/>(meaning 5/4 against 1/1), adding to the complexity of the notated<br/>score(correct me if this is not quite accurate) In other words C =<br/>1/1, 3/2  = G, and 5/4 = E -. The minus makes this more complicated<br/>on the score then with Ben&apos;s notation in the same situation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the other hand, yes, a two dimensional lattice is more complex<br/>than a one dimensional, but the same chord is less complex<br/>notationally. C = 1/1, G = 3/2, E = 5/4. No minus is required. I&apos;m<br/>sure to most people on this list this is not new stuff, but I&apos;m just<br/>attempting to show a brief comparison.</p><p>Hello JoJoBuBu!</p><p>This is just &quot;Jo,&quot; so you&apos;re a &quot;Jo&quot; and two boo boos ahead of me!</p><p>Well, what you say makes sense, but, on the other hand, if I am<br/>understanding things correctly, a simple tried even on D minor has<br/>a &quot;D&quot; with a minus sign, so things get pretty complex fast!</p><p>That is, unless one really is centering around C major continuously.</p><p>I have some reservations about the primacy of the key of C major in<br/>ANY intonational inflection... just or otherwise.</p><p>Why center on that?  OK, there is a certain historical precedent, but<br/>why not go back &quot;all the way&quot; to good ol&apos; Pythagoras (who possibly<br/>didn&apos;t exist) and take it from there...?</p><p>&gt;I see this as a give or take. It would seem good to understand both<br/>points of view,</p><p>I think there is no question but that &quot;Monzowolfellholtz,&quot; partially<br/>invented by our own Monz, is decidedly superior as a notation.</p><p>&gt; but the choice of what notation to use doesn&apos;t seem as important as<br/>just working on the sound of the intervals or the ear training aspect<br/>of microtonality in general, no matter what system you are working<br/>in.</p><p>Well, this is a very good point, which was emphasized (gently... not<br/>quite :) ) by Paul Erlich and David Doty himself (a user, of course,<br/>of the system...)</p><p>However, MY point in some of my prior posts is that NOTATION REALLY<br/>DOES make a difference, and that it even LEADS people to write in a<br/>certain way.</p><p>I could see a person using Johnston&apos;s notation to want to &quot;gravitate&quot;<br/>toward the key of C Major, for instance, just because it was a<br/>notational breeze...</p><p>For<br/>&gt; another point of view, with a similar idea, here is an excerpt from<br/>an article by Adam Silverman entitled &quot;Notation Styles for Microtonal<br/>Just Intonation.&quot; (page 19) (sorry if you all have already read this -<br/> and alot of this info really comes from this source)</p><p>Nope.

I remember it was played on<br/>baroque flute. Of course there is no baroque flute<br/>standard midi patch, but people do re-do midi files as mp3s or<br/>whatever using appropriate patches.</p><p>I&apos;ve greatly enjoyed the chopin you posted recently, and I thnk the<br/>adapitive tuning bring out his singing melodies wonderfully, and make<br/>the counterpoint clearer too. I htink he is a natural to adaptively<br/>tune to j.i. because of his wonderful singing melodies, whatever<br/>one might say about authenticity.</p><p>Pehaps the counterpoint is brought out most clearly in the<br/>7-limit one. I certainly like that one, so join the club of those<br/>who you say must have something seriously wrong with them.</p><p>I don&apos;t hear this thing about equal semitones and find the chromatic<br/>scales very exciting. Perhaps I do notice a kind of evenness about<br/>the chromatic passages in 12-tet, but not so sure, more notice<br/>the exciting variety of colour in the adaptively tuned ones.</p><p>There is a kind of &quot;mistyness&quot; about the 12-tet discords that is rather<br/>suited to Chopin however.</p><p>(See for example the discord on the repeated note just after the end<br/>of the lovely slow melody that ends the piece, just before the<br/>closing bars, which changes to a much crisper chord and the<br/>whole resolution is much stronger in the adaptively tuned versions.<br/>I like both, but actually, prefer the adaptively tuned resolutions<br/>really).</p><p>I wonder what tuning he actually used for his pianos?</p><p>I experimented playing as a cycle with the 12-tet version first.<br/>It was a nice way to hear them.</p><p>The original un-retuned version has no patches in it - playing<br/>it first, got some interesting renderings of Chopin on recorder<br/>:-) then on a second try after playing a bit of one of the others,<br/>recorder + piano (recorder playing the sustained base notes<br/>of course not fading away at all, and arpeggiated accompaniment)!</p><p>Of course, that&apos;s not going to be anything to do with<br/>your program.</p><p>Now if only one could adaptively tune a real acoustic piano<br/>(as in the fantasy grand)!</p><p>I&apos;ve also been gradually mulling over the cue points idea for<br/>adaptive tuning, but not getting very far with it. It would be<br/>easy to set them if the notes for chords were always played<br/>in the same order I expect, - one would just need to go through<br/>the entire midi file and make a search tree from it, each time<br/>indexing a note by the following sequence of notes. So when a<br/>particular sequence of notes is played, one uses that to key into<br/>the search tree, and go instantly to right part of the file.</p><p>(<br/>search tree entry would be:<br/>key = note sequence sufficiently long to uniquely identify the cue point<br/>+ data = pointer to relevant place in the midi file<br/>)</p><p>Then idea would be, by default starts at beginning of piece.</p><p>If you stop and re-start, moves to whatever point you re-started<br/>at. First time it does this you would expect some sliding of pitch.<br/>but then having cued it in to where you want to start from, it will<br/>then keep starting from that point, until you move to another practice<br/>cue point, and so on.</p><p>Seems quite workable and wouldn&apos;t need one to use a score editor<br/>to set the cue points. The search tree could be reasonably fast<br/>and not too large memory wise, except possibly for large<br/>repeated secitons, which might be a problem.</p><p>But, how will one ever deal with chords that could be started<br/>with the notes in any order (at level of milliseconds).</p><p>I think could be hard to do.</p><p>If one could recognise all the chords, then one could order<br/>the notes of a chord,say, from lowest to highest, and ignore<br/>the time order for those, and then it would work okay I<br/>imagine.</p><p>Anyway, will continue to keep it in mind.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>JoJoBuBu@aol.com</h3><span>5/11/2001 11:50:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 5/11/2001 10:55:50 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>LOL.

C is as good as any. C major is a simpler key to base it on as<br/>opposed to B triple sharp major. It is a better choice than any other key<br/>since it has no sharps or flats. On the other hand if you really want to base<br/>a lattice off B triple sharp major,or any other key, thats ok too. if you<br/>want to base off pythagoras I wont complain.</p><p>One important thing to remember with Bens actual music itself is that he<br/>often wants a 5/4.(not always of course but at least this would be fair to<br/>say for some of the string quartets)  In other words he had in mind the very<br/>music he was intending to write.  This doesn&apos;t mean his notation is better it<br/>just means different notations cane have different purposes. If you look at<br/>his string quartet scores in depth its pretty clear why he did it the way he<br/>did it, at least from my point of view. If you look at the ninth or tenth<br/>this should be very clear. Like I said though I&apos;m not saying its a better OR<br/>worse on the whole in ALL situations, cause thats just not an issue I&apos;m<br/>concerned with, if its even possible for a notation to have that cabability<br/>(meaning being better in all situations).</p><p>&gt;I think there is no question but that &quot;Monzowolfellholtz,&quot; partially<br/>&gt;invented by our own Monz, is decidedly superior as a notation.</p><p>&gt;However, MY point in some of my prior posts is that NOTATION REALLY<br/>&gt;DOES make a difference, and that it even LEADS people to write in a<br/>&gt;certain way.</p><p>&gt;I could see a person using Johnston&apos;s notation to want to &quot;gravitate&quot;<br/>&gt;toward the key of C Major, for instance, just because it was a<br/>&gt;notational breeze...</p><p>Well I see your point for sure. Notation does make a difference thats a<br/>reasonable statement. On the other hand Look at Toby Twinings music. He uses<br/>JI in an EXTREMELY complicated way, with Bens notation,  and by no means<br/>whatsoever tends to gravitate towards C major. Have a look if you can get a<br/>hold of a score and you will, hopefully see what I mean.  Sure notation is<br/>important but to say one notation is superior in this particular case seems<br/>more an academic argument then a viable advancement.</p><p>&gt; another point of view, with a similar idea, here is an excerpt from<br/>&gt;an article by Adam Silverman entitled &quot;Notation Styles for Microtonal<br/>&gt;Just Intonation.&quot; (page 19) (sorry if you all have already read this -<br/>&gt;and alot of this info really comes from this source)</p><p>&gt;Nope.&nbsp; And, in fact Monz asserts he gave all these citations, but I<br/>&gt;DO NOT believe he gave any Silverman citation...</p><p>I am actually not sure if the article I mentioned is published because Ben<br/>just had it lying around the house.

Did people add up all the<br/>marks on different scores and come up with some statistics suggesting the<br/>simplicity of one notation over the other in certain circumstances? In what<br/>cirumstances? Those types of studies could be very interseting and convincing<br/>if the methodology is reasonable.

But you see<br/>&gt; how C is really not the center of symmetry, because of the arbitrary choice<br/>&gt; to have the<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes I think I see what you mean. You mean that when you look at the lattice<br/>its not symetrical per se around C and instead the commas make this diagonal<br/>looking sort of thing as its structure governed by the intervals which Ben<br/>based it on. (this is really obvious when you make a gigantic lattice). On<br/>the other hand C is the 1/1 and everything does relate to that whether its<br/>looks symetrical or not. I dont necesarily think that the diagonal lattice<br/>makes the notation worse or better, and I dont think that is what you are<br/>saying, but I would agree that it is an interesting thing to notice about the<br/>lattice, the diagonal nature of the commas, which governs the notation.</p><p>Lastly If thinking about JI music, at least whenever I&apos;ve seen him do it, Ben<br/>doesn&apos;t look at the lattice of course he just has the &quot;rules&quot; so to speak of<br/>how the intervals work in his notation in mind and therefore the lattices<br/>aren&apos;t even needed. This is why I brought up the analogy of the 12TET<br/>keyboard. You just remember that B to F is not a perfect fifth. So in this<br/>context its a really simple way to think about notation because theres only a<br/>few simple rules to memorize and then lattices become less important.</p><p>Thanks for the interesting discussion Paul!</p><p>Andy</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2001 7:56:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Robert Walker wrote:]<br/>&gt;Hadn&apos;t realised you could retune files so easily.</p><p>Yes.  It&apos;s quite easy.  I can even batch tune many files in one swell<br/>foop.  It does suck a fair amount of juice out of the computer while<br/>it&apos;s running, due to the repetitive internal calculations.  Each retuning<br/>takes approximately as long as the sequence does to play.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d love to hear all the cpe Bach you&apos;ve retuned if it isn&apos;t too large<br/>&gt;a file as I like his style a lot, and I think adaptive tuning will<br/>&gt;bring it out.  Would be interesting to see if it does.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll be large.  Do you want soft or rigid vertical<br/>springs, and dom7ths at 8/9 of root (my older practice for 5-limit) or<br/>9/10 of root (&quot;tuning file free&quot;, or what Paul E calls &quot;true 5-limit&quot;)?</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ll keep an eye out and see if I can find the midi file for c.p.e.<br/>&gt;Bach flute sonatas anywhere.</p><p>Please do!</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve greatly enjoyed the chopin you posted recently, and I thnk the<br/>&gt;adapitive tuning bring out his singing melodies wonderfully, and make<br/>&gt;the counterpoint clearer too. I think he is a natural to adaptively<br/>&gt;tune to j.i. because of his wonderful singing melodies, whatever<br/>&gt;one might say about authenticity.</p><p>Kyool!</p><p>&gt;Pehaps the counterpoint is brought out most clearly in the<br/>&gt;7-limit one. I certainly like that one, so join the club of those<br/>&gt;who you say must have something seriously wrong with them.</p><p>;-&gt;</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t hear this thing about equal semitones and find the chromatic<br/>&gt;scales very exciting. Perhaps I do notice a kind of evenness about<br/>&gt;the chromatic passages in 12-tet, but not so sure, more notice<br/>&gt;the exciting variety of colour in the adaptively tuned ones.</p><p>It&apos;s funny, I&apos;ve got sequences where uneven step sizes do bother me,<br/>but not this one.</p><p>&gt;I wonder what tuning he actually used for his pianos?</p><p>This piece is on Ed Foote&apos;s latest CD, &quot;Six Degrees of Tonality&quot;.  He<br/>uses a De Morgan temperament, a kind of backward Well temperament (i.e.,<br/>F# major is more consonant than C major).  But as I recall, the liner<br/>notes express uncertainty as to what Chopin himself used.</p><p>&gt;The original un-retuned version has no patches in it - playing<br/>&gt;it first, got some interesting renderings of Chopin on recorder<br/>&gt;:-) then on a second try after playing a bit of one of the others,<br/>&gt;recorder + piano (recorder playing the sustained base notes<br/>&gt;of course not fading away at all, and arpeggiated accompaniment)!</p><p>Funny!  It&apos;s amazing how many good midi files of piano works have no<br/>patch command(s).  I run a GM reset file before I play anything, as a<br/>matter of habit, so I usually don&apos;t notice.</p><p>&gt;Now if only one could adaptively tune a real acoustic piano<br/>&gt;(as in the fantasy grand)!</p><p>Oh yeah!  Some day I&apos;m gonna throw a pot of money at that challenge, if<br/>at all possible...</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve also been gradually mulling over the cue points idea for<br/>&gt;adaptive tuning, but not getting very far with it. It would be<br/>&gt;easy to set them if the notes for chords were always played<br/>&gt;in the same order I expect, - one would just need to go through<br/>&gt;the entire midi file and make a search tree from it, each time<br/>&gt;indexing a note by the following sequence of notes. So when a<br/>&gt;particular sequence of notes is played, one uses that to key into<br/>&gt;the search tree, and go instantly to right part of the file.</p><p>My program uses a construct called a &quot;pseudo-simultaneous event&quot; (PSE),<br/>which collects up MIDI transitions within a preset period of time<br/>(default 64 msec), and does further analysis as if they had all happened<br/>together.  This would be very useful for synchronization, I think: one<br/>does not expect everything to happen in a particular order within the<br/>PSE, but one DOES expect to go into the PSE with a particular set of<br/>notes playing, and to come out of the PSE with some other set of notes<br/>playing.  I would base tracking on these successive sets of expected<br/>notes.</p><p>&gt;Anyway, will continue to keep it in mind.</p><p>Please do!  This challenge can wait to be solved, if necessary.  But<br/>it&apos;ll be fun once somebody gets it up and running.

Use<br/>&gt; the new one for new music. Besides, every one that lives on<br/>&gt; Theory Street keeps forgetting that for HP the theory and the<br/>&gt; scale were a means to an end: communicate using musical<br/>&gt; materials. I hope that is where the M business is headed.</p><p>First, I want to add that I am well aware of your feelings<br/>concerning Partch&apos;s work, and that indeed music is only a<br/>part of it.  His endeavor to achieve a truly corporeal<br/>experience in his work entails a lot of other domains<br/>along with the music.</p><p>But to me, MIRACLE is *very* much a means to an end.<br/>I don&apos;t have much hope of playing any Partch instruments,<br/>with the single exception of the replica Harmonic Canon<br/>at the Sonic Arts Gallery.</p><p>But if/when I get my MIRACLE Ztar, I will finally be able<br/>to play Partch&apos;s music on my own instrument, at my own leisure,<br/>and can study it thoroughly.  The Ztar can be programmed to<br/>play either Partch&apos;s actual 43-tone JI scale, or any of the<br/>MIRACLE scales, or any other tuning I care to put on it<br/>(within its own physical limitations, which really aren&apos;t much).</p><p>So I&apos;m looking forward to using MIRACLE to compose new music<br/>*and* to study the work of others that I really haven&apos;t had<br/>the ability to analyze *and play*.</p><p>&gt; Papers and books can come later. 12-tET theory books and treatises<br/>&gt; (treatii?) didn&apos;t *precede* the practice, did they? (Hell, that&apos;s<br/>&gt; actually an honest question, and I probably won&apos;t be around to read<br/>&gt; the answer!)</p><p>I&apos;ve mentioned this before (last year?).  There are two<br/>different kinds of theory: proscriptive and descriptive.</p><p>A theory like Schoenberg&apos;s _Harmonielehre_ was descriptive,<br/>because he was simply describing what he saw already<br/>happening in his music and that of others.  Partch&apos;s<br/>theories in _Genesis_ are *certainly* descriptive of his<br/>own musical practice.  A theory like Yasser&apos;s or Schillinger&apos;s<br/>is proscriptive, because it is a complete ready-made system<br/>looking for a &quot;user&quot;.</p><p>Schoenberg&apos;s case is particularly interesting in this respect,<br/>because I feel that his attitude changed to a proscriptive<br/>one by the time he invented the 12-tone Method.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I really think Joe Pehrson was closest to the mark when he<br/>&gt; &gt; talked about MIRACLE taking the place that 12-EDO used to<br/>&gt; &gt; (...

How about just adding a new resource, and be done<br/>&gt; with it?</p><p>Well, that&apos;s not exactly what I meant.  What I meant was:<br/>if we&apos;re going to have any kind of monolithic tuning around,<br/>I&apos;d much prefer MIRACLE to 12-EDO.</p><p>Hell, I still write 12-EDO music.  But as time goes on, I&apos;m<br/>retuning more and more of it...</p><p>My real point was that I see MIRACLE as being capable of<br/>being so many things to so many people that it could easily<br/>usurp the role that 12-EDO has had for about a century<br/>or more... and that would be a real good thing.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>5/15/2001 8:18:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>Excellent points, all!

(I would think that it still could be used for this purpose.)</p><p>&gt;&gt;i think that *is* what it does, but in a more clever way than<br/>&gt;&gt;a &quot;naive&quot; just intonation analysis would suggest (imho).</p><p>What I meant was that it&apos;s constantly making adjustments, even within<br/>passages that are all within a given &quot;key,&quot; so, yes,  it does allow you to<br/>modulate,  but it&apos;s operating on a much more fine-grained level than<br/>simply  adjusting the tuning once every time you modulate.</p><p>You had suggested that you could play an adaptuned piece using a pedal<br/>that would switch the tuning every time you modulated. . . my response was<br/>to say, sorry, but the tuning&apos;s gonna change a lot more often than that.</p><p>I *think* I&apos;m right about that. . . ?</p><p>I know that in my piano sonata, it changes every note,  pretty much.</p><p>cb</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2003 11:26:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>HI Wermer,</p><p>Nice to see posts from you on the list :-).</p><p>YOu may be interested to know that I&apos;m exploring another approach in my<br/>FTS program, real time. It is strict adaptive tuning with diesis shifts,<br/>uncompromising. If you have a comma pump then it will spiral up or down<br/>the pump. If you have a diminished seventh and play overlapping diads<br/>you will get a major diesis shift at the octavae - at least<br/>if one uses the strong dovetailing option.</p><p>So it isn&apos;t really meant for performance of common practice harmony<br/>particularly in its present form. It is best for exploring the diesis<br/>and comma shifts, and for composing and improvising pieces that work with the<br/>shifts, and maybe even exploit them as features. It does also have<br/>options to somewhat soften the tuning and make the connection of notes<br/>with previous ones looser, but this isn&apos;t much developed at all.</p><p>I plan to put up a page soon about this with retuned examples.<br/>Meanwhile you can find a few if you scroll down in the bug fixes<br/>and what is new page:</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/bug_fixes.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/bug_fixes.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/whats_new.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/whats_new.htm</a></p><p>You will find some examples in the bug fixes page which show<br/>that leisure tuning can find better tunings for some pieces<br/>at least for strict adaptive just intonation tuning<br/>than any real time system could possibly<br/>achieve.</p><p>Is that the same for Hermode tuning - can it also be<br/>used for leisure time retuning as well?</p><p>I have also used it though for retunign the fractal tunes<br/>in FTS and it seems to work well for many of those.<br/>Also for retuning some C.P.E. Bach and J.S. Bach<br/>flute pieces that I practice on the recorder for my<br/>practice sessions, and those too worked really well to my ears. They<br/>have many diesis shifts though so it is rather dependent<br/>on how tolerant one is of those - I seem to be<br/>exceedingly tolerant of them except in a few situations<br/>as to my ears diesis shifts have a tendency to sound like really tiny<br/>semitones in many contexts, indeed sometimes I hardly<br/>realise that it is a shift and not a proper scale<br/>step if I don&apos;t listen closely to what is going on.</p><p>Anyway I have some midi clips there of those too but<br/>I&apos;ll probably do some recordings later with my playing too, as I think<br/>that may bring out what they are like for someone<br/>playing along with them, maybe they will make more<br/>sense that way.</p><p>It seems to me that real time and leisure time could<br/>work together so that you play a piece in real time<br/>and also record it in midi or some such and<br/>process that file after the event in order to<br/>get another retuning that looks forwards as well<br/>as backwards.</p><p>Incidentally it has no connection with hermode tuning and<br/>wouldn&apos;t infringe on your patent I&apos;m sure. I use a method<br/>of searching through all the notes currently in play to<br/>maximise the number of consonant diads between the<br/>currently played note and previous notes in the chord.</p><p>Another thing about this is that the tuning of a chord<br/>may depend on the exact order in which you play the notes,<br/>as it has no look ahead. Is this the same for Hermode<br/>tuning or is it independent of the order of the notes,<br/>or maybe somewhere in between?</p><p>Anyway it is a fascinating field to be involved in.<br/>Wish you all the best for your Hermode tuning systm,<br/>and I have enjoyed my visits to your site to find<br/>out about what you are doing.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com">http://www.robertinventor.com</a></p></div>
