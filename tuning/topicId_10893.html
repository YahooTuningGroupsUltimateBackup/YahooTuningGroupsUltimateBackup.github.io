I don&apos;t know enough about<br/>it to say why it doesn&apos;t on yours.</p><p>Keenan Pepper said<br/>&gt;     Has anyone heard of the game Conway&apos;s Life? It&apos;s that little annoying<br/>&gt; program that comes with some operating systems and all it does is make<br/>&gt; little blobs multiply on a square grid apparently randomly, but they&apos;re<br/>&gt; always really working on some sort of rule. I was thinking, what if you let<br/>&gt; them do that on a lattice? Take a 3-5 lattice, for instance, and set up a<br/>&gt; game of Conway&apos;s Life on it, with different rules reminiscent of cadences,<br/>&gt; where whenever a cell occupied a square that pitch would sound. Oscilators<br/>&gt; would make pedals or rythmic patterns in the same meter as their period (a<br/>&gt; period-3 oscilator would do something in 3/4 time), gliders would modulate<br/>&gt; endlessly, and spacefillers would form gigantic, increasingly dissonant<br/>&gt; tonal structures. The generations would tap out the beat. I&apos;ll set to work<br/>&gt; on it straight away.</p><p>Excellent idea.
