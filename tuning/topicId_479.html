He<br/>related the consonance of an interval in a given register with the<br/>shortness of the period of repetition of the waveform resulting from<br/>both notes of the interval. This is not an implausible explanation of<br/>consonance but note that (a) the slightest deviation from just<br/>intonation causes the wave period to increase astronomically, and (b)<br/>adding a higher identity to an otonal chord leaves the period untouched,<br/>or perhaps multiplies it by 1, while adding a higher identity to a<br/>utonal chord multiplies the period by orders of magnitude. (a) is<br/>somewhat in line with Partch&apos;s hardcore JI-ism, but is quite silly in<br/>light of the accuracy of actual instruments, instrumentalists, the ear,<br/>and myriad tempering schemes. (b) spells disaster for the otonal/utonal<br/>dualism that Partch espouses, and the inconsistency between this dualism<br/>and the wave-period justification of consonance is probably the most<br/>glaring inconsistency in Partch&apos;s theory.</p><p>&gt;If it<br/>&gt;were not for overtones, there would be no beating phenomena that make a<br/>&gt;justly tuned interval just in the first place.</p><p>That is mostly true, but again, there are some other phenomena that make<br/>otonal chords &quot;special&quot; even in the absence of overtones. Utonal chords<br/>do, however, require harmonic overtones to be &quot;special&quot; -- the other<br/>phenomena are related to the wave period so, as discussed above, do not<br/>favor utonal chords in any way.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t see 4/3 as an abstract utonal generation</p><p>Neither would Partch -- three or more notes are necessary to classify a<br/>chord as &quot;otonal&quot; or &quot;utonal&quot;.</p><p>&gt;or some kind of &quot;three<br/>&gt;limit&quot; interval,</p><p>I don&apos;t see why you object to that.</p><p>&gt;but rather as the interval between the third and fourth<br/>&gt;partial.</p><p>The third and fourth partial of what? Of the difference tone between<br/>them? Or is it that the third partial of one note coincides with the<br/>fourth partial of the other note? Both are true, but there are different<br/>theoretical camps based on which fact is deemed more important for<br/>explaining musical effect. These camps will agree that 4/3 is consonant,<br/>but will disagree on issues such as otonal/utonal dualism.</p><p>&gt;Alternately it can be thought of as dividing a string in 3 and<br/>&gt;then making another string 4 of those lengths. Or, it is 3/4 of a<br/>string in<br/>&gt;relation to the whole string.</p><p>Why would these facts have anything directly to do with our perceptions?</p><p>&gt;What I was wondering was does anybody know if someone<br/>&gt;is currently making a guitar with interchangable fretboards? I see a<br/>real<br/>&gt;nice one in Scheider&apos;s book &quot;The Contemporary guitar&quot; (1985), that he<br/>says<br/>&gt;is made by Tom Stone of Intonation Systems in Iowa. A search on the net<br/>&gt;turns up nothing, so I dont know if anything like this is being made by<br/>&gt;anyone. The series of fretboards is just what I would drool over -<br/>various<br/>&gt;just, harmonic, historical and cultural intonations. Anybody who can<br/>help<br/>&gt;me out here, I would appreciate it greatly.</p><p>Likewise. If you hear anything let me know. I&apos;d like to have lots of<br/>different guitars, but I&apos;m holding out for interchangable fretboards so<br/>I don&apos;t blow all my cash.</p></div>
