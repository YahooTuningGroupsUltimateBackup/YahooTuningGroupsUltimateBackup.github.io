If b is a<br/>&gt; fixed small integer, it follows from a very deep and recent<br/>&gt; conjecture in elementary number theory called the ABC conjecture that<br/>&gt; in the p-limit, there will be only a finite number of ratios (a+b)/a.</p><p>Is there any mathematical proof for this?</p><p>&gt; From this we get the following list:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3-limit<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2, 3/2, 4/3, 9/8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5-limit<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5/4, 6/5, 10/9, 16/15, 25/24, 81/80<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7-limit<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7/6, 8/7, 15/14, 21/20, 28/27, 36/35, 49/48, 50/49, 64/63, 126/125,<br/>&gt; 225/224, 2401/2400, 4375/4374<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11-limit<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11/10, 12/11, 22/21, 33/32, 45/44, 55/54, 56/55, 99/98, 100/99,<br/>&gt; 121/120, 176/175, 243/242, 385/384, 441/440, 540/539, 3025/3024,<br/>&gt; 9801/9800<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is no guarantee that these lists are complete, or even finite,</p><p>I can give a proof that the first list is complete:</p><p>Let&apos;s consider the 3-limit interval as</p><p> a=2^c<br/> b=3^d</p><p>where c &amp; d are integers<br/>The interval is</p><p>b/a where a=b-1</p><p>or a/b where b=a-1</p><p>a=b-1 ==&gt;<br/>(1) 2^c = ( 3^d ) -1</p><p>if d is odd let&apos;s put d1= d-1 then 2^c = ( 3^d1 ) * 3 -1   ==&gt;  2^c -2 = ( 3^d1 ) * 3 -3</p><p>where d1 then is even.</p><p>==&gt; (2 ^ ( c-1 ) -1 )  * 2 =  (( 3 ^ d1 ) -1 ) * 3</p><p>this means ((3 ^ d1) -1 ) = [( 3^ (d1/2) ) -1 ] * [ ( 3 ^ ( d1/2) ) +1 ] is even (2).<br/>and unless c =1 we have [ ( 3^ ( d1/2 ) ) -1 ] * [ ( 3 ^ ( d1/2 ) ) +1 ] /2 is odd value</p><p>Let&apos;s put :<br/>f = [ ( 3 ^ ( d1/2 ) ) -1 ]<br/>g= [ ( 3 ^ ( d1/2 ) ) +1 ]</p><p> g * f / 2 is odd value means g or f is odd , but here we have f = g +2 this means f &amp; g are both odd which means f * g is odd which cannot be ( from ( 2) )</p><p>c=1 means ( 3^d ) -1 =2 means (3^d) = 3 means d =1. the result 3/2</p><p>Now if d is even, from (1):</p><p>2^c = [ ( 3^(d/2) ) -1 ] * [ ( 3^(d/2) ) +1 ]<br/>                =e                            =f<br/>e = 2^ee</p><p>f= 2^ff</p><p>2^ee = 2^ff + 2</p><p>2^(ee-1) = 2^(ff-1) + 1</p><p>this cannot be unless 2^(ee-1) =1 ==&gt; ee-1 = 0 ==&gt; ee =1 ==&gt; e=2, f=4 ==&gt; c=3 the result is 9/8<br/>or ( 2^(ff-1) ) =1 ==&gt; ff-1=0 ==&gt; ff=1 ==&gt; f=2, e=0 ==&gt; 2^c= 0 connot be</p><p>for b=a-1...
