We all do what we want and I am no exception. Now if I could only remove that &quot;wanting to&quot; level and could see my way clear timewise then I Might one day have something tuning related to share. However, much as I have rejected authority in my short dilettantish life, I have alas become one in other areas of music than tuning, namely, percussion. Yes, I am sure that explains a lot right there, you are probably thinking, &quot;Aha, a Drummer&quot; (Please Note: My solution to the capitalization problem, when emphasis is needed I Simply capitalize the first letter of the word, easier on the eyes than SHOUTING! &lt;grin&gt;).</p><p>Despite my perceived authority after moderating on Djembe-L (at yahoogroups) for a decade and having something to offer via my website, I too have run afoul of the Wiki-junkyard-dogs. I attempted to make some edits pointing to valid, germane, articles I&apos;d written ...only to be summarily accused of being a malicious Spammer and charged with what they cryptically call COI (&quot;Conflict Of Interest&quot;) a ban-able offense. All my careful edits thrown out, like the proverbial baby with the bath water. Little care seemed to given to the Content provided, only to the manner in which the information was delivered, or the person who provided such. When I protested that COI wasn&apos;t an issue in that one of my web pages was submitted by another editor and had stood there for many months, the response was to remove that link, also. &lt;sigh&gt;</p><p>I folded my discount tent and moved on, except to give this testimony.</p><p>Thanks for Everything!<br/>One Love, R<br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/RevRClark">http://tinyurl.com/RevRClark</a><br/>++++++<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;If you have something, something that gives you joy, peace, ecstasy, share it.
