Can you explain what this one is, how it&apos;s different from<br/>the one above, etc.? You say it&apos;s &quot;Seth&quot; (arized?) but somehow I<br/>think there must still be some just 5th partials in these<br/>timbres . . .</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact that would sound nice transposed down a couple of octaves<br/>&gt; - here it is again:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/12_et_oddt2_to_12_Bessel_Seth_C2.mp3">http://www.robertinventor.com/12_et_oddt2_to_12_Bessel_Seth_C2.mp3</a></p><p>Well here, the timbres don&apos;t seem to hold together as single pitches.<br/>When the 2nd &quot;note&quot; comes in, I&apos;m hearing at least an augmented<br/>triad, not a dyad.</p><p>&gt; Here is the buzzy x^3 sin(1/x^3), this time using all<br/>&gt; the harmonics up to the 13th, not setharised<br/>&gt; (didn&apos;t make much difference whether you did it Setharised not):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/12_et_all_to_13_xu3_sin_1oxu3_un_seth.mp">http://www.robertinventor.com/12_et_all_to_13_xu3_sin_1oxu3_un_seth.mp</a><br/>3</p><p>This sounds normal, like a clav or something.

In this regard, I asked you for some data on the<br/>waveforms you were using -- looking forward to whatever you might<br/>want to share . . .</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert.</p></div>
