When the recorded third came in, I fell off my chair!!!! It was<br/>*way* higher than 4:5. So, then I sang &quot;my&quot; high third into the open fifth<br/>and when the recorded third came in we had a tonal love affair!</p><p>The third in jerry0 might still be a smidge low, but then that may be due to<br/>the adrenaline pumping through the sheer excitement of finding a synthesized<br/>major chord with human ears. WOW!</p><p>I&apos;ll go back and spend some time with the others and offer my &quot;evaluations.&quot;<br/>It&apos;ll really be easy with the new format. Thanks for your efforts. I can&apos;t<br/>wait to find out what you did to prepare these examples.</p><p>I think I&apos;ll go pour me a stiff one.
