A<br/>sad and messed up feller, but the gift of genius was his. To me, perhaps<br/>the most important point to recognize was his openness to all forms of<br/>music...definitely not a jazz snot, or any snot at all. It was reported<br/>that he would often listen to country music on the jukebox at a certain<br/>bar, and his followers just couldn&apos;t believe it...when one of them<br/>finally asked him why, he said &quot;Listen to the stories..&quot; A marvelous<br/>lesson for any musician...Hstick  PS...while driving with a friend once,<br/>he was told that animals liked music..he asked his driver to stop, went<br/>into a field, and played a few bars for a cow...</p></div>
