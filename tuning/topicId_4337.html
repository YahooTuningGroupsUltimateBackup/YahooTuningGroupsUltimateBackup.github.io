As<br/>&gt;someone who knows many of them I would never mistake one for  the other.</p><p>Two-member ratios are not the full story. Chords of three or four notes can<br/>resolve ambiguities inherent in the individual intervals. Common-practice<br/>Western music since the abandonment of meantone temperament considers dyads<br/>to be incomplete harmonies, and the 5-limit triad is the norm. My idea of<br/>music in 22-tET uses the 7-limit tetrad as the norm. Each ratio within the<br/>7-limit tetrad is clarified by its position relative to the others. The<br/>otonal tetrad in 22-tET is much closer to just than in 12-tET, though<br/>musicians have been trying to use the latter for at least a century. 22-tET<br/>can distinguish the utonal tetrad from a 5:6:7:9 chord, which 12-tET can&apos;t<br/>do. To my ears, the distinction made in 22-tET is qualitatively the same as<br/>that made in JI.</p></div><h3><a id=4356 href="#4356">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I don&apos;t know when Western<br/>music reverted to two-part counterpoint. But I do know that Western pop<br/>music in the 20th century is largely triadic, while Schoenberg and his ilk<br/>have had little influence outside academia.</p><p>&gt;&gt; My idea of<br/>&gt;&gt; music in 22-tET uses the 7-limit tetrad as the norm.

If the context determines it all, the composer<br/>is<br/>&gt;constantly hemmed in just making clear what it is he means.</p><p>If the 7 is not in the bass then the chord will certainly be heard as<br/>1-3-5-7.</p><p>&gt;Why not use 31 or<br/>&gt;41?</p><p>Because my understanding of music is based on the idea that the harmony is<br/>formed from patterns in the underlying melodic scale. The decatonic scale in<br/>22 forms a pseudo-diatonic set from which 7-limit harmonies may be drawn. No<br/>one has yet found such scales in 31 or 41 (though we&apos;ve certainly been<br/>looking!). The closest things are 19-out-of-31 (Dave Keenan), an MOS<br/>generated by fifths, and 22-out-of-41 (me), an MOS generated by major<br/>thirds. However, these scales are very large and would be difficult to<br/>project compositionally, not to mention some other properties they don&apos;t<br/>share with diatonic and decaonic scales.</p><p>Once again, I&apos;m more than happy to advocate dynamic retuning so that each<br/>member of the 22-tone tuning may fluctuate slightly to better the harmony at<br/>each moment. However, I suspect many of us will be working with fixed-pitch<br/>instruments for some time to come, so 22-tET has some importance.</p><p>&gt;12et is no standard to build any new upon. Otherwise we keep delaying the<br/>&gt;problem till later.</p><p>That seems to imply that JI is some kind of ultimate goal in musical<br/>evolution. I strongly disagree.</p></div>
