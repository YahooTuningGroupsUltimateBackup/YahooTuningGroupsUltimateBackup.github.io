This early version was created at the Princeton University<br/>Computer Center using Music4BF. I&apos;ve emailed Prof. Ruff to see if it is still available.</p><p>The CD listed on Ruff&apos;s web pages at <a href="http://www.willieruff.com/menu.html">http://www.willieruff.com/menu.html</a>  is at<br/>least in part a new version prepared at Stanford and contains 3 tracks.<br/>However, a sample of the first track is available for free download as an mp3<br/>file and I recommend hearing it to compare it to Monzo&apos;s and Walker&apos;s treatment<br/>of the same material. The liner notes are also downloadable and I&apos;ve appended<br/>them below. They are a short summary of the 1979 paper without the technical<br/>details of Kepler&apos;s laws, the history of the concept of the &quot;music of the<br/>spheres,&quot; and some details of the tuning and phasing of the voices. By phasing,<br/>I mean starting the voices in different stages of their cycles to simulate the<br/>orbital positions of the corresponding planets on Dec. 27, 1571 (Kepler&apos;s<br/>birthdate).</p><p>The liner notes:</p><p>The Harmony of the World</p><p>A Realization for the Ear of Johannes Kepler&apos;s Data from Harmonices Mundi 1619</p><p>The main purpose of this record is to present Kepler&apos;s Harmony of the World for<br/>a period of several centuries. We decided that the length of time represented<br/>would have to be at least as long as the period of revolution of the slowest<br/>planet, Pluto. Pluto&apos;s period is approximately 248 years or, in our terms, 20<br/>minutes and 42 seconds, and we chose a total length of 22 minutes, representing<br/>264 years.</p><p>When one listens to the full nine-part Harmony - six tonal and three rhythmic<br/>&quot;voices&quot; - one may find it difficult to sort out the individual voices and<br/>assign them to the planets they represent. Therefore we begin by introducing the<br/>planets one by one, from the innermost to the outermost. The first you hear is<br/>Mercury, which as the innermost is the fastest and the highest pitched. It has a<br/>very eccentric orbit (as planets go), which it traverses in 88 days; its song is<br/>therefore a fast whistle, going from the E above the piano (e&quot;&quot;&apos;) down more than<br/>an octave to about C# (c#&quot;&quot;) and back in a little over a second.</p><p>Venus and the Earth in contrast have nearly circular orbits. Venus&apos; range is<br/>only about a quarter tone, near the E next above the treble staff (e&quot;&apos;); Earth&apos;s<br/>is about a half tone, from G (g&quot;) to G4# at the top of that staff. Together they<br/>drone a sixth, but the sixth is continuously changing from major to minor, or<br/>even down partway to a fifth, as the two planets go through their cycles -<br/>about 3 seconds for Venus, exactly 5 for Earth. Kepler compared Earth&apos;s sad<br/>minor second to the first minor second in the standard Do-Re-Mi scale - mi-fa-mi<br/>- and for him it sang of Earth&apos;s unending misery-famine-misery. Living into the<br/>period of the Thirty Years War, and indeed dying then, he knew what he was<br/>talking about, and for many millions in our own century, the song has not changed.</p><p>Next out from the Earth is Mars, again with an eccentric orbit. Its song is<br/>distinctive, one of the easiest to pick out in the full Harmony. Alone in the<br/>alto, it ranges from the C (c&quot;) above middle C down to about F*~ (f4t&apos;) and<br/>back, in nearly 10 seconds.</p><p>The distance from Mars to Jupiter is much greater than that between the inner<br/>planets (as mentioned above, the asteroids in this gap may represent a missing<br/>planet), and Jupiter&apos;s song is much deeper, in the baritone or bass, and much<br/>slower. It covers a minor third, from D to B (D to B) just below the bass staff.<br/>Still farther out and still lower is Saturn, only a little more than<br/>a deep growl, in which a good ear can sometimes hear the individual vibrations.<br/>Its range is a major third, from B to G (B2 to G2),the B at the top being just<br/>an octave below the B at the bottom of Jupiter&apos;s range. Thus the two planets<br/>together define a major triad, and it may well have been this concord - in the<br/>ratio 4:5:6, inevitable when angular velocities are equated with<br/>pitches - that made Kepler sure he had cracked the code and discovered the<br/>secret of the celestial harmony. Saturn&apos;s cycle is about 2 1/2 times that of<br/>Jupiter (almost 2 1/2 minutes vs. almost 1 minute), and their songs commonly<br/>strike the concordant ratios. This would be even more evident if the speed of<br/>the music were doubled, so that the cycles were half as long and the<br/>pitches were all raised an octave; together they then sing a majestic<br/>counterpoint in the key of G Major.</p><p>The outer, post-Kepler planets we have simulated not by musical tones at the<br/>given vibration frequency but by sharp rhythmic beats. Uranus is a rapid<br/>ticky-ticky-ticky changing gradually from less than 9 to more than 10 per second<br/>and back but over a period of 7 minutes, so that the change is not easy to<br/>detect. When the much steadier (because much less eccentric) Neptune is added,<br/>however, at nearly 5 per second, the changes in Uranus&apos; rhythm become more<br/>obvious, because the ratio between the two shifts continually back and forth<br/>from less than to more than 2:1, and the resulting &quot;beats&quot; are readily discerned.</p><p>Finally Pluto&apos;s bass-drum beat is the foundation of the whole structure.<br/>Although its period is so long - 20 minutes and 42 seconds - its orbit is so<br/>eccentric that the gradual slowing down and even more the speeding up of the<br/>rhythm is manifest. At Pluto&apos;s slowest, the ratio with Neptune is almost 1 to 2<br/>1/2, yet near its fastest their rhythms are identical and at the highest<br/>point Pluto is actually a little faster, because in fact at its closest point to<br/>the Sun it is actually closer than Neptune ever comes (lending credence to the<br/>view that Pluto is only an escaped satellite of Neptune&apos;s). Thus the relation<br/>between the two rhythms is continually changing, and &quot;beats&quot; come and go as they<br/>come into a simple ratio and then recede from it again. The additional doubled<br/>rhythm of Uranus, ticking away above, adds greatly to the fascination of this cross-rhythm.</p><p>We have inserted a part of the Harmony at half speed. The inner planets come<br/>down an octave and are clearer and more readily grasped. Jupiter on the other<br/>hand retreats into the basement, and Saturn is hardly audible. The cross rhythm<br/>of the outer planets proceeds at half pace, and its intricacies become even more apparent.</p><p>Part 2 begins with several minutes for the rhythmic planets alone, introduced<br/>one by one from Pluto in to Uranus. Then we add the visible planets, this time<br/>in order from Saturn to Mercuryrepresenting the second half of the full Harmony<br/>of the World, characterized particularly by the steady acceleration of Pluto to<br/>its perihelion and then a minute or so of relaxation beyond.</p><p>High fidelity earphones greatly enhance the spatial effect of the general<br/>planetary movement around the Sun. Note that the positions of the planets change<br/>in their orbits in Stereo from side to side. Always play the recording in Stereo.</p><p>Since proportion is the key to Kepler&apos;s idea of the Harmony of the world, this<br/>recording can be played at slower or faster speeds. Slower speeds will lower the<br/>pitches and allow for a greater harmonic appreciation of the inner planets while<br/>reducing the tonal presence of Jupiter and Saturn. Higher speeds will bring<br/>Saturn and Jupiter into Tonal prominence but Mercury will<br/>climb near or beyond the upper limits of our pitch perception.</p><p>This realization of Kepler&apos;s data was developed at Yale by Professors Rodgers<br/>and Ruff and recorded at Stanford University by Mike McNabb, Sound Synthesis Consultant.</p><p>Produced by Willie Ruff and John Rodgers</p></div>
