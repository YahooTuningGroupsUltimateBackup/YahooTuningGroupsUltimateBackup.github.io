I will have replaced my<br/>old tutorial with an HTML version of this FAQ at<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/guitar.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/guitar.html</a> by the end of the<br/>day.</p><p>Q: How can I convert a regular guitar to a microtonal one?<br/>Q: How can I make a fretless guitar?</p><p>A: Refretting a standard guitar is not all that difficult<br/>if you are patient, careful and have the right tools. Although a<br/>functioning microtonal guitar can be made with fewer specialized tools,<br/>and with less attention to detail, the following is in my opinion the<br/>minimum necessary to do a professional job, one you could charge money<br/>for and have a satisfied customer.<br/>&#x9;Making a fretless guitar is easy: just follow the first part of the<br/>directions, before we mark and cut the new fret slots. You will need<br/>only items 1,3,4,5,6,9,10,11,14,17,19 and 20.</p><p>You will need some (see above), or all, of these tools and<br/>supplies:</p><p>1. A 40 watt soldering pencil<br/>2. A fret saw<br/>3. A fret puller<br/>4. A long sanding block available from an auto body supply<br/>shop, and sandpapaer to go with it, in 120, 220 and 320 grit<br/>5. A small (6&quot; by 3&quot;) sanding block<br/>6. At least one sheet each of  40, 80, 120, 220, 320, 400 and 600 grit<br/>sandpaper<br/>7. A weighted plastic or brass faced hammer, or, alternatively, a ball<br/>peen hammer with a piece of leather glued to the flat face<br/>8. A ruler marked off in hundredths of an inch (at a good art supply<br/>store or the mechanical drawing section of a university book store)<br/>9. Several tubes of super glue<br/>10. Single edge razor blades<br/>11. X-acto knife with narrow (scalpel blades are the best) and wide<br/>blades<br/>12. Jewelers files and/or nut cutting files<br/>13. A flat smooth file about 10&quot; long and and 1&quot; wide. Sight down a<br/>number of files if you can to find the flattest.<br/>14. Paste wax<br/>15. Fret wire (available from Luthier&apos;s Mercantile,<br/>    Stewart-MacDonald, GHS strings, or other sources)<br/>16. A mechanical pencil with .5 mm lead<br/>17. A set of new strings<br/>18. An X-acto razor saw<br/>19. Phillips and flat blade screwdrivers<br/>20. Small socket set or small crescent wrench<br/>21. Artist&apos;s masking tape</p><p>There is a list at the end of this article of suppliers for these tools<br/>and supplies, and some suggestions for makeing some of the tools<br/>yourself.</p><p>Removing the old frets:</p><p>&#x9;Remove the neck from the guitar if possible, and remove the tuners and<br/>nut. Do not loosen the truss rod unless the neck is significantly back<br/>bowed (back bow is when the center of the neck is higher than the ends).<br/>You want the neck to be flat or have the slightest back bow when you do<br/>this work. If the neck does not come off, remove the tuning pegs (except<br/>on a classical guitar) and cover every part of the face of the body with<br/>paper affixed by artist&apos;s masking tape. I recommend artist&apos;s tape since<br/>it is not as sticky as painter&apos;s tape and is less likely to leave gum on<br/>the finish, or even pull some of it off. This paper will protect the<br/>finish of the top as you work on the guitar. &#x9;</p><p>&#x9;Wax the fingerboard and back of the neck thoroughly with paste wax<br/>(Johnson&apos;s or other) and let it dry. Do not buff. This wax coating will<br/>help repel the super glue that will inevitably drip where you don&apos;t want<br/>it when you are gluing in frets or repairing fingerboard chips.<br/>&#x9;Heat the frets with the soldering pencil to remove old glue. I have<br/>found that about 8 seconds at three evenly spaced positions on the fret<br/>is sufficient. Hold the soldering pen against the fret with the flat<br/>part contacting as much fret area as possible. Start at one<br/>end of the fret and move in as the fret is being pulled. Immediately<br/>after heating, place the end of the end nipper at the end of the fret<br/>and squeeze until the fret has lifted up enough for the nipper to move<br/>in a little. Move in a little and squeeze until the fret raises up a<br/>little more. Keep this up until you have moved the nipper all the way<br/>across and the fret is out of the slot. All this time, the soldering pen<br/>is moving ahead of the nipper.<br/>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;Little chips of wood will inevitable come out as the tang of the fret<br/>lifts out of the slot. If you should remove a large chip by accident,<br/>immediately replace it and glue in place with super glue. Should you<br/>lose a chip, the hole can be filled with super glue and wood dust. Most<br/>hardwood dust is slightly basic and will cause super glue to harden<br/>almost immediately (much as will saliva, blood, sweat and tears). Place<br/>a little super glue in the hole and cover with sawdust from the same<br/>kind or lighter colored wood than in the fingerboard you are working on.<br/>You can get a little dust by running the saw blade through an empty<br/>fret slot. You are just going to fill it with wood dust anyway. The glue<br/>will wick into the dust and harden very quickly. It takes a little<br/>practice to get just the right amount of glue and dust. I recommend<br/>gluing chips back in right away, and filling holes when the frets are<br/>all out.</p><p>Filling the old slots<br/>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;Now that the frets are all out, it is time to fill the fret slots. If<br/>you are refretting to an octave equivalent tuning, it is not necessary<br/>to fill the octave fret. First, run the fret saw through the slots to<br/>remove any remaining glue or obstructions. If you have a bound<br/>fingerboard, run the tip of the saw through from binding to binding and<br/>blow the dust out. If you have a fingerboard made from dark wood, there<br/>are several good ways to fill the fret slots. If you have a maple or<br/>other light wood fingerboard, there are no really good good ways I know<br/>of to fill the slots, as filled fret slots are always darker than maple<br/>even if you fill them with maple veneer (although see ****** below for a<br/>method I have recently had some success with). The glue lines at the<br/>edges of the fret slot almost always show up dark. I will list the four<br/>best<br/>ways I know of filling dark wood fret slots.</p><p>Method 1:</p><p>&#x9; Find a strip or page of veneer of a wood that is the same color or a<br/>little lighter in hue than the wood from which your fingerboard is<br/>made.  Get veneer as close in thickness as you can to the thickness of<br/>your fret slots. Cut strips of veneer a little wider than the depth of<br/>the fret slots and as close as you can to the exact width of the guitar<br/>neck at the fret slot you are filling. It is difficult to cut off<br/>protruding ends without marring the finish on the side of the<br/>fingerboard. Do the fret closest to the bridge first for practice. If<br/>you mess it up, it won&apos;t be noticed as much as the first fret, for<br/>instance.<br/>Place the veneer in the fret slot and carefully wick a small amount of<br/>glue into the wood between the veneer and the fret slot. Make sure that<br/>all the surfaces are bound, but don&apos;t put glue into the side of the slot<br/>yet. With luck, the glue will wick into the end of the slot by itself. &#x9;<br/>&#x9;When the glue is dry (to speed this up, you can us Hot Shot or other<br/>commercial super glue accellerators available at hobby shops or through<br/>Luthier&apos;s Mercantile), carefully slice off the protruding veneer with<br/>the razor blade by pulling the blade at a 45 degree angle to the<br/>fret slot with the blade as flat as you can against the neck. A series<br/>of short strokes is best, and be careful not to cut into the<br/>fingerboard. You will not remove all of the veneer on the first pass.<br/>Repeat the cutting process until there is barely any veneer protruding.<br/>Place paper under the neck to catch the sawdust for later use. Sand the<br/>stub with the grain of the neck using the small sanding block and 120<br/>grit paper. When the fingerboard is smooth here, brush off the dust with<br/>an old toothbrush and inspect your work. If you think you can improve<br/>your technique, do the next fret slot down.<br/>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;When you are confident that you have the knack, fill all the remaining<br/>slots with veneer, glue, cut and sand. Brush off and inspect your work.<br/>There are probably a number of little holes you missed. Fill these with<br/>wood dust and super glue. Remove the old position markers by<br/>drilling them out, being careful to go no deeper than necessary (you<br/>need that truss rod!). Place a little glue in the bottom of the hole and<br/>cover it with wood dust. Fill the hole to the top with wood dust and<br/>tamp in, leaving only the slightest crown. Wick super glue into the dust<br/>and let set. This will take a few minutes, and the fillet may even smoke<br/>a little as the glue sets up.<br/>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;When everything has hardened, sand the whole neck with the long sanding<br/>block with 120 grit sandpaper. Sand straight along the neck with even<br/>pressure, with the grain of the fingerboard, taking care to follow the<br/>radius of the neck. You will want to sand all the way across the width<br/>of the neck, angling the sanding block to conform to the curvature of<br/>the neck. Take care to stay away from the edges. The are certain to get<br/>sanded as a result of sanding near the edges. Inspect the fingerboard<br/>again and make any necessary repairs.</p><p>Method 2:</p><p> Fill the fret slots with wood dust by tamping it in with a<br/>business card or single edge razor blade until full. Slowly wick in<br/>super glue until the dust is secured.</p><p>Method 3:</p><p>Put super glue in the slot and sprinkle on wood dust to set<br/>the glue.</p><p>Method 4:</p><p>Make a mixture of 5 minute epoxy and wood dust and push into the fret<br/>slots with a business card or razor blade.</p><p>&#x9;Each of these methods requires wood dust lighter than the wood you are<br/>using. The mixture of dust and glue is always much darker than the wood<br/>the dust came from. If you are a perfectionist, and you should be if you<br/>want to be satisfied with your guitar, you should make some tests on<br/>wood dust to glue ratio in order to match the color of your fingerboard.<br/>Compare color of a sanded patch of fingerboard, as some manufacturers<br/>dye their wood, and your fingerboard is probably darker as the result of<br/>use.</p><p>******&#x9;If you have a light wood fingerboard, I recommend the veneer<br/>method, although recently I was able to do a pretty good match on a<br/>maple fingerboard with acetone-diluted Plastic Wood. It took a lot of<br/>testing,<br/>but it worked pretty well. It does need a top coat of super glue or<br/>urethane, as Plastic Wood is not that flexible.</p><p>###########################################################</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;FRETLESS INSTRUCTIONS</p><p>&#x9;If you are making a fretless guitar, you are almost done. Once you have<br/>the fret slots filled and level sanded, you must sand with increasingly<br/>fine grits. Sand with 220, 320, 400 and 600 grit, then brush off with an<br/>old toothbrush. Inspect the side of the neck and carefully<br/>trim any protruding veneer or glue with a single edge razor bleade or<br/>x-acto knife. If you have been extremely careful, you won&apos;t need any<br/>touch-up. Wax the fingerboard, remove the tape and polish the entire<br/>guitar with a soft cloth.</p><p>&#x9;You will need to sand the nut down since the distance between the<br/>strings and the neck is now less by the height of the frets. Mark off a<br/>little less than the height of a fret along the bottom of the nut with a<br/>sharp pencil. Glue a piece of 80 grit sandpaper to a flat piece of wood<br/>and sand the nut by rubbing the bottom of the nut over the sanding<br/>block, sanding almost to the line. Put the strings on and try the<br/>guitar. Play it for a while and adjust the height of the nut until it is<br/>just right.</p><p>###########################################################</p><p>Calculating the fret positions</p><p>&#x9;Now you have a smooth, filled fingerboard and are ready to mark the<br/>positions for fret slots. To calculate the length of your fret scale,<br/>measure the distance from the nut to the octave fret and multiply by<br/>two. Measuring from the nut to the bridge is not reliable.  The general<br/>formula for the distance from the nut to the kth fret is</p><p>f(k)=length(1-1/r)</p><p>where f(k) is the distance to the kth fret from the<br/>nut, length is the total scale length and r is the ratio you want from<br/>the fret. Let&apos;s say, for example, you measured a 12&quot; from the nut to the<br/>12th fret and that you want frets placed so as to give a scale of</p><p>1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8, 2/1.</p><p>This is an example of a just major scale. The nut<br/>is at 1/1, the first fret is calculated by</p><p>f(1)=24(1-1/(9/8))=24(1-8/9)=24(1/9)=2.67&quot;,</p><p>the second fret is calculated by</p><p>f(2)=24(1-1/(5/4))=24(1-4/5)=24(1/5)=4.8&quot;.</p><p>The remaining calculations are similar. The octave is 2/1, so the fret<br/>calculation is</p><p>f(8)=24(1-1/(2/1))=24(1-1/2)=24(1/2)=12&quot;,</p><p>just as it should be.</p><p>&#x9;The formula for equal tempered fret spacing is the same, but now<br/>instead of ratios, we use powers of two (unless you are using a<br/>non-octave scale).</p><p>The formula</p><p>f(k)=length(1-1/r)</p><p>is better written as</p><p>f(k)=length(1-2^(-k/n))</p><p>where the carat is the power sign and n is the number of equal tempered<br/>steps to the octave. As an example, let&apos;s calculate a few fret<br/>measurements for 19tet with a 35&quot; bass guitar scale. The 0th fret is the<br/>nut, and the distance to the first fret is given by</p><p>f(1)=35(1-2^(-1/19))=35(1-.9642)=35(.0358)=1.25&quot;.</p><p>The distance to the 8th fret is</p><p>f(8)=35(1-2^(-8/19))=35(1-.7469)=35(.2531)=8.86&quot;.</p><p>Keep your figures accurate to four places and your final measurement<br/>should be accurate to 1/100&quot;. Notice that .2531 is very close to 1/4.<br/>This is as it should be, since the 8th fret in 19 approximates the<br/>perfect<br/>fourth (4/3) very well, but is a little sharp. Plug 4/3 into the<br/>equation for just frets and you will get</p><p>length(1-3/4)=length(1/4)=length(.25).</p><p>It is a good idea to test the algorithm a couple of times in this way<br/>before you cut to make sure you are using it correctly.</p><p>&#x9;The general procedure for measuring for fret slots is the same whether<br/>you are using just intonation or equal temperament. Draw a pencil line<br/>down the centerline of the neck. Tape your ruler against this line with<br/>two sided tape with the end exactly against the end of the fretboard,<br/>and make a mark where the first fret will be. Be sure you do<br/>this very precisely. Use a very sharp pencil or a mechanical pencil with<br/>.5mm lead. Mark each fret position until you reach the octave. The last<br/>mark should line up exactly with the former 12th fret. Retape the ruler<br/>at the octave, and mark at 1/2 the distance calculated for the first<br/>octave. Now, depending on the type of ruler you have, either flip it<br/>over and tape it on the other side of the center mark, or slide it over<br/>and tape it parallel to the center mark. In either case you want a new<br/>set of<br/>marks parallel to the first and on the other side of the neck. Repeat<br/>the process until you have two sets of parallel marks. Connect the marks<br/>and you have a set of lines marking where all the frets will be placed.<br/>It is<br/>very important to do the measuring and cutting precisely. Check your<br/>work and redo the process if you have any doubt about the accuracy.</p><p>Cutting the new fret slots<br/>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;It is time to cut the fret slots. If you are cutting the slots by hand,<br/>you will need a guide to clamp or tape on the neck to assure that the<br/>saw cuts the slots accurately. I use a straight piece of wood that has a<br/>little cup cut out so as to fit snug against the face of the<br/>fingerboard. It is possible to cut fret slots by hand without a guide,<br/>but you increase the possibility that the saw will slip and mar the<br/>fingerboard. Tape or clamp the guide to the neck using a leather or cork<br/>jawed clamp, being careful to line it up about 1/2 the width of the fret<br/>saw behind the pencilled in fret mark. Making sure the saw is parallel<br/>to the neck, take one light swipe over the neck from side to side to<br/>make sure the block is properly placed. If the saw has cut out the line<br/>you<br/>are OK. Realign the guide if necessary. Cut into the fingerboard to a<br/>depth of about 1/40th of an inch deeper than the fret tang. You don&apos;t<br/>have to be anal about this--you just don&apos;t want to cut the slot too deep<br/>or too shallow. The same depth as the old slots is usually about right.<br/>Continue up the neck until you have all the slots cut. You may want to<br/>cut the top fret slots first so that your technique improves as you get<br/>closer to the lower frets, which, in general, will be the most used. If<br/>you nick the fingerboard during this process, wait until after the<br/>position markers are laid in to fix the nicks.</p><p>Laying in the position markers</p><p>&#x9;We will now lay in the position markers. Decide where you want the<br/>position dots (if any) and mark them by connecting with pencil the left<br/>and right ends of the fret slots between which the markers will be<br/>placed. You now have an &quot;X&quot; whose center marks the dot&apos;s position. Punch<br/>the center and drill the hole to the depth of the marker. Place the<br/>position dot in the hole and wick in super glue. When the dots are set,<br/>sand the fingerboard with the long sanding block using 120, 220, 320<br/>and  400 grit paper until the neck is smooth and blemish free. If there<br/>is any touch up you need to do, now is the time to do it, as once the<br/>frets are laid in this chore will be extremely difficult.</p><p>Placing the frets</p><p>&#x9;Re-wax the fingerboard, being careful not to get any in the slots. If<br/>you do, drag the fret saw lightly through the slot a couple times to<br/>remove it. The wax will help keep the super glue leaks from sticking to<br/>the fingerboard. To lay in the frets, cut off a piece of fret wire with<br/>the end nippers (or fret puller or toenail clipper), making sure there<br/>is enough straight tang to span the entire slot. The fret should be a<br/>little longer than the slot so that the deformed end where is was cut<br/>does not have to be pounded into the slot. The protruding ends will be<br/>cut off later with the end nipper. Lay the neck in a padded cradle made<br/>from a 4&quot;x4&quot;x4&quot; piece of wood with a cup cut out about the same radius<br/>as the back of the neck. I use a piece of<br/>sheepskin to line the cradle. This cradle insures that the back of the<br/>neck is protected while the fret is being hammered in and also that<br/>there is a good coupling from the table to the neck to transfer the<br/>energy of the hammer into the fret. For a classical guitar, the cradle<br/>may have to be taller. Plase the fret over the slot and tap the fret in<br/>lightly on one side of the fingerboard using the fret hammer. Once the<br/>fret is seated on one side, tap across the fret to seat it all the way<br/>across. Check to make sure it is seated against the fingerboard by eye<br/>and by trying to run you fingernail under it. If it needs to be tapped<br/>in harder, tap from the center to the outside in both directions. Be<br/>especially careful when doing this on a classical guitar. I prefer not<br/>to fret a classical above the 12th fret using a hammer since the risk of<br/>cracking<br/>the top or loosening braces is so great with this method. If you want to<br/>get fancy, there are a number of products available to press in frets.<br/>Again, you might want to practice on the higher frets first until you<br/>get a hang of the method.</p><p>&#x9;Take the end nipper and start from the lower frets, nipping off the<br/>protruding frets flush with the edge of the fingerboard. With care, you<br/>will not mar the surface. Carefully apply a coat of wax with a Q-tip to<br/>the edge of the fingerboard, avoiding the fret slots. Apply one drop<br/>of super glue at a time to the fret ends, allowing it to wick in. About<br/>3 drops is enough for each side is enough. Make sure glue is not oozing<br/>out the other side of the fret slot. If there are any frets whose ends<br/>just wouldn&apos;t stay down when you tapped them in, clamp them down before<br/>you<br/>apply the glue. A little baking soda on the glue will help it set up<br/>faster (though super glue accelerator is better). When the frets are all<br/>glued in, you may find that a little glue has seeped out between the<br/>fret and the fingerboard. Carefully cut the glue off with a single edge<br/>razor blade. You can score the glue next to the fret so it will come off<br/>easily. Here is where the fingerboard waxing is so important. With<br/>enough wax, the glue actually just peels off.</p><p>Dressing the frets</p><p>&#x9;Your frets are laid and it is time to dress them. Polish the wax on the<br/>fingerboard until it shines, then lay masking tape between all the frets<br/>to protect the fingerboard. This time, you may need to use painter&apos;s<br/>masking tape so it will stick better to the waxed surface. Run a magic<br/>marker across the top of each fret so you can tell what has been cut.<br/>Run the flat file lightly over the surface of the frets along the length<br/>of the neck, taking care to avoid making the same stroke twice. You<br/>should make a sort of criss-cross pattern along the length of the neck,<br/>trying to cover the length of the neck from several different angles.<br/>This way the file will tend to average the height of the frets over the<br/>whole surface.<br/>&#x9;As you file, the marker is cut from the highest portion of the frets.<br/>You are finished when there is at least a thin line cut through the<br/>magic marker all the way across every fret. Some of the lines of visible<br/>fret material will be wider than others, and that is all right.<br/>Brush off the filings and re-ink the frets. If you have a fret crowning<br/>file, run it across the top of each fret until there is a thin<br/>continuous line of fret material showing.<br/>&#x9;If you don&apos;t have a fret crowning file, run the long sanding block<br/>lightly over the fret surfaces using 320 grit sandpaper until a thin<br/>line of fret material shows through every inked fret. Now is a good time<br/>to lay in side position dots if you want them. The procedure for removal<br/>of the old and laying in the new is the same as that for dots on the<br/>surface of the fingerboard. Use the flat file to smooth the sides of the<br/>fingerboard where the frets end and the dots have been laid in. With<br/>care, you can do this without marring the finish much.<br/>&#x9;You may want to refinish the fingerboard edges, or you may want to wax<br/>them after a light touchup sanding. Never use silicone wax, as it will<br/>make refinishing impossible should you decide to do so in the future.<br/>With<br/>a jeweler&apos;s file or a file with a flat, noncutting edge (place the non<br/>cutting edge in contact with the fingerboard), using one or two light<br/>strokes only, file the tips of the fret at the edge of the fingerboard<br/>where<br/>the fret meets the fingerboard surface. The file should start at 45<br/>degree angles to both the plane of the fingerboad and a parallel to the<br/>length of the fret. The file remains at a 45 degree angle with the plane<br/>of the<br/>fingerboard, but during the stroke its angle relative to the length of<br/>the fret changes from 45 degrees to 90 degrees. This action takes a<br/>little practice, but the end result is a fret with a smooth edge where<br/>the hand is likely to contact it.</p><p>&#x9;To finish the frets, start with 220 paper (or 320 if you used a<br/>crowning file) and vigorously hand sand (no block, fingers gripping a<br/>small piece of sandpaper) each fret along its length to smooth the crown<br/>and remove nicks. When you are done with one grit, move up to the next<br/>finer, taking care to brush the fingerboard free of grit from the<br/>previous coarser sandpaper. This insures that a finer sandpaper will not<br/>drag a piece of detached coarse grit across the fret and mar the<br/>surface. Following the 600 grit paper, use 00 or 000 steel wool for the<br/>final finish. Brush off the neck, remove the tape and admire your<br/>handiwork.</p><p>Final steps</p><p>&#x9;Apply a fresh coat of wax or polish, re-attach the neck and replace the<br/>nut. Since you have new frets you may have to adjust the height of the<br/>nut. You can remove material from the bottom of the nut or from the<br/>slots, or if you need to raise the height of the nut (more likely) you<br/>can shim it with slips of brass strip (to be found at hobby stores), or<br/>with drops of super glue on the bottom of the nut hardened and filled by<br/>dropping baking soda on it. File the baking-soda-super-glue filler with<br/>a jeweler&apos;s file of an X-acto saw to get the right string height at the<br/>nut. You will probably have to adjust the bridge height too. Open a new<br/>set of strings, string it up and play!!</p><p>&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;Where to get Supplies</p><p>A fret saw, fret puller, weighted plastic or brass faced hammer, ruler<br/>marked off in hundredths of an inch, and fretwire can be obtained from<br/>Luthier&apos;s Mercantile, Stewart McDonald, GHS, or any number of luthiers&apos;s<br/>supply companies. A hand fret saw may be made by purchasing a good<br/>quality miter saw of approximately 0.023&quot; blade width and flattening the<br/>kerf (the waviness of the set of the teeth) carefully with a light<br/>hammer on an anvil or other flat surface.</p><p>The ruler in hundredths of an inch can usually be obtained at an art<br/>supply store or sometimes at a college book store (drafting classes!).</p><p>Jewelers files can be obtained from jewelry supply stores or good<br/>hardware stores.</p><p>Instead of a fret puller, you can grind the face of an end nipper<br/>(availableat a good hardware store) until the bevel of the cutting edges<br/>is ground away and the face is smooth and rounded. I have also heard of<br/>people using toenail<br/>clippers. The main thing is to have a flat or convex clipping face.</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
