And having<br/>&gt;interchangeable keyboard mappings means each needn&apos;t be as useful on its<br/>&gt;own as if that were all you had.</p><p>Graham, please understand that I&apos;m not dissing any plans you may have.  I<br/>strongly believe there&apos;s worlds to be done with a retuned halberstadt and a<br/>sequencer -- Brian McLaren has produced hours of such material.  It&apos;s just<br/>my choice to spend my time obtaining a keyboard that suits me, and then<br/>learning to play it, rather than learning to play one that doesn&apos;t, even<br/>though the latter option could be a fruitful one.  It&apos;s just my choice.<br/>It&apos;s what brought me to this list.  In fact, theory for me is just a means<br/>to a keyboard design.</p><p>Now, I know I&apos;ve said that a retuned halberstadt isn&apos;t &quot;serious&quot;.  That&apos;s<br/>based on some very careful thought about what made the Halberstadt so good<br/>for 12-tone tunings in the past 1000 years.  See, I believe the keyboard<br/>has had no small impact on music as we know it -- in fact, I believe it<br/>gave birth to western music.  What I&apos;m saying is, I doubt there will ever<br/>be a serious genre of music based on retuned halberstadts.  If somebody<br/>proves me wrong on that, I certainly wouldn&apos;t complain, but...</p><p>Like it or not, serious keyboard music is played &quot;live&quot;.  The ability for<br/>one person to control a large number of resources in real time with his<br/>hands is not a small deal.  It forces a certain understanding of music.<br/>Serious keyboards (ones that are up for consideration as a standard) are<br/>expected to do a wide variety of things -- like rehearsing a choir.  You<br/>simply cannot rehearse a choir in JI with a halberstadt.</p><p>&gt;A diminished triad contains two minor thirds.  Either could be subminor,<br/>&gt;and with the right keyboard you can try all three versions to see which<br/>&gt;you want.  And do that really easily.</p><p>And how would the ability to an octave prohibit this choice?</p><p>&gt;Sure, if you&apos;ve got one.</p><p>I&apos;m saying there are good reasons to get one!  That it is worth the effort.<br/> And the expense is not prohibitive!  How could anybody believe such a<br/>thing?  Do you drive a car?  Live under a roof?  Use a PC?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Caring about what voicings I can reach is arbitrary?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Insisting on reaching an octave with one hand is arbitrary.</p><p>No, it isn&apos;t.  What I insist upon, to be clear, is to be able to reach at<br/>least the interval of equivalence with a single hand.  As it is, much<br/>beautiful music would be lost by making the halberstadt bigger so that,<br/>say, Oscar Peterson could reach _only_ an octave.  Yes, it is true that by<br/>making such a strict rule, I imply a sudden change of goodness that doesn&apos;t<br/>exist.  Yes, I&apos;d probably take a keyboard on which I could only reach a<br/>15/8 if it appeared on my doorstep.  But every bit you loose, you loose a<br/>bit.  The IE is a good goal to set, because it is the point at which you no<br/>longer need two hands to play every interval in the tuning.</p><p>&gt;You can play cool music on a bad instrument.  My contention is that<br/>&gt;extended mappings allow you to do cool things that wouldn&apos;t otherwise be<br/>&gt;possible.  And if you&apos;re interested in the right scales, it may be worth<br/>&gt;rebuilding a keyboard to make them work better.  So long as that&apos;s<br/>&gt;understood, no problem.</p><p>Understood, and agreed.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
