His<br/>music,<br/>with overwhelming intensity, combines lush chromatic harmonies, sweeping<br/>lyrical motives, and great dynamic contrast.<br/>Laganella was born January 10, 1974 in Stratford, New Jersey.He grew up<br/>in<br/>a musical environment where he studied cello, piano, and guitar. His<br/>formal music studies began at the Berklee School of Music where he<br/>enrolled to study jazz and improvisation. It was there he was introduced<br/>to twentieth century concert music and given his first lectures in<br/>composition.<br/>Laganella went on to pursue his composition studies at New York<br/>University. While in Manhattan, he spent one year as the apprentice<br/>conductor of the New York Youth Symphony where he studied conducting,<br/>orchestration, and lead rehearsals at Carnegie Hall. He graduated from<br/>NYU<br/>cum laude with a bachelors degree in composition and theory.<br/>Presently, Laganella is a Ph.D. candidate and Teaching Fellow at the<br/>University of Pennsylvania. Recently, he received a scholarship prize to<br/>study with Betsy Jolas at the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau,<br/>France.
