A fine example is<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/mclaren/post118.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/mclaren/post118.html</a>. If I were<br/>teaching a class on Wilson CPS scales, a great exam question would be,<br/>&quot;find all the errors in Brian&apos;s article.&quot; First and foremost, the two<br/>hexanies that Brian starts the post with, and says have a &quot;distinctly<br/>different sound&quot;, are exactly the same scale! See if you can find the<br/>other errors in the post -- maybe John Starrett will agree to put a<br/>warning next to Brian&apos;s article.</p></div>
