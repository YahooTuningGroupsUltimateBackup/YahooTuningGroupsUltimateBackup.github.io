Your right though, the group title can<br/>be misleading.  I have tried the 5 string open tuning as was<br/>suggested by some members.  The part that doesn&apos;t play right in<br/>standard or 5 string open tuning is where the lyrics say &quot;You better<br/>stop&quot;....  There are only 2 strings that are changing and it doesn&apos;t<br/>sound like it is a slide up the frets which it would have to be with<br/>either of these tunings.  Actually what I should do is look for the<br/>tabulature for this song.  It shouldn&apos;t be too hard to find.  Again<br/>thank you to all that responded.</p><p>Bill Bau</p></div>
