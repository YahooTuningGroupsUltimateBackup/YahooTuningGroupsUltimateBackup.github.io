The harmonic series will be present only when<br/>straight-line tubes and strings are present. Other elastic natural thingies<br/>such as shells and fairly flat pieces of rock that present pitched material<br/>to our ears have some pretty irrational arrangements of tones, to say nuttn,<br/>of course, of rocks and other irregular objects.<br/>And, when I slow down crickets, there are also some odd overtones, which one<br/>would expect considering how the sound is made.<br/>We are a contrivance of Nature and anything we contrive will still be pretty<br/>well-connected with the rest of Nature. In fact, the thing I find most<br/>appealing about electronic musical instruments is that they can make sounds<br/>that are a lot closer to what I hear outside of manmade nature than our<br/>previous mechanisms.<br/>Equal temperaments ARE man made, and thus are NOT a natural<br/>&gt;phenomenon...the<br/>I agree that before humans came along, such a thing didn&apos;t exist, but thanks<br/>to us, it does _now and is just as much a part of the natural world as other<br/>sonic phenomena.<br/>vibrations produced are going to vary from the<br/>&gt;naturally occuring intervals of the harmonic series, and this means<br/>&gt;something...what, I&apos;ll spend the rest of this life studying...Hstick<br/>&gt;My feelings: well, maybe it means something, but not very much beyond the<br/>infinite variability of Nature. The meaning is not in the device or process<br/>so much as it is in the products that affect our whole beings, not just our<br/>brain alone.<br/>You would write music that&apos;s just as powerful and full of joie de vivre,<br/>regardless of the underlying pitch construct.

Light , and colour , is<br/>also<br/>a vibration but its frequency is more in the region of 562, 949, 953,  421 ,<br/>321<br/>cycles a second. Each colour has its own frequency  , just like pitch.<br/>So , in one sense , you could say that colour (or light ) is simply a sound<br/>that is<br/>so high that you need a different baodily organ to perceive it (the ear is<br/>only<br/>designed for certain frequencies) , or , alternatively , sound is simply<br/>light of<br/>such a low frequency that it cannot be perceived by the eyes .Perfumes ,<br/>Xrays,<br/>Heat , Electricity ....etc. These are all things that have their own<br/>vibrational<br/>frequency ranges.Research into sound and music therapy has shown that each<br/>organ<br/>in your body has its own vibrational frequency.

In theory it can be done with loss of fidelity<br/>now, like MP3. But the amount of processing power required is humongous. The<br/>main &quot;target market&quot; for MPEG-4 Structured Audio is things like games, where<br/>most of the sounds are synthesized. I&apos;m using it because I&apos;m a pure computer<br/>composer, and it does (in principle) everything CSound can do, but the<br/>syntax is easier to read than CSound.</p><p>Interestingly enough, I don&apos;t see the &quot;major&quot; synthesizer manufacturers like<br/>Yamaha jumping on either the CSound or MPEG-4 SA bandwagon. I think their<br/>fortunes are irrevocably tied to MIDI, Sound Fonts and other things that<br/>they&apos;ve made into de facto standards. I don&apos;t see Microsoft jumping on that<br/>bandwagon either. In short, for now anyway, MPEG-4 Structured Audio is just<br/>an interesting phenomenon, and a force to watch. At least one of the<br/>composers on the Tuning Punks site (I don&apos;t remember who) uses it. MPEG-4 SA<br/>tools can take MIDI input, of course, as can CSound, reducing the user&apos;s<br/>task to one of digital synthesizer design, which, unfortunately, has a steep<br/>learning curve. But MPEG-4 SA and its predecessor CSound are infinitely<br/>flexible -- both are general-purpose digital signal processing engines.<br/>--<br/>M.
