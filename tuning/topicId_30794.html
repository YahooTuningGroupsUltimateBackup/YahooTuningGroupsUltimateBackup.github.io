I thought it<br/>was a good idea to show the step sizes of Blackjack along with the<br/>scale:  L and S... so that the trombonist could hear that when<br/>practicing the scale.  That was really the only *major* change.</p><p>But reflecting on that piece and some of my recent works, I have to<br/>say that even though the extent of compositional *forces* in my<br/>pieces are significantly smaller now -- I&apos;m intentionally writing for<br/>solo instruments and electronics at the moment -- these pieces are<br/>easier to use to train performers and are relatively easy to produce -<br/>- I really feel that some of this work is among the most interesting<br/>music I have ever written!</p><p>And, basically, it&apos;s a result of this list.</p><p>So, thanks again to everybody!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
