For example, even though it doesn&apos;t have a fifth (it&apos;s a good 40 or so cents off!) is does have a tone with very similar feel/&quot;character&quot; to a fifth that tries to fool the brain into thinking it is a fifth.<br/>------------------------------------------------<br/>   I realize Lucy-Tuning and virtually every other tuning theory (&quot;even&quot; Sethares&quot;) has some subset of it which has it&apos;s own explanation of how/why the diatonic scale works...so I figured it&apos;s about time I tried it. :-)</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
