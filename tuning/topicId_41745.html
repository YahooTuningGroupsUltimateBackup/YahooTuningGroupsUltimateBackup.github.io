It is quite possible I read a little into John&apos;s posting of your note, and you certainly read more negativity into what I posted then I intended!

Doubting only on the Marimba Lumina, really: it is beautiful, but costs an astronomical amount! Maybe MalletKats would work for you, but they aren&apos;t cheap either; I have seen them used effectively for a wide range of musics, and sounds like they would definitely be a possibility for you.</p><p>&gt; And no one needs to hear more on this in the near future.<br/>&gt; It was just a question.</p><p>nononono. I hope you *do* respond back if you find something you like, and I&apos;m sorry you felt caught in the cross-hairs of a musico-philosophical diatribe.</p><p>OTOH, in some areas of Partch I&apos;m pretty picky.
