None of us would argue that there is only one<br/>tuning &quot;system&quot; in use today.

But I know you well enough (I think) that you wouldn&apos;t<br/>logically conclude from this that it must therefore explain the high third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Unlike singers, string players learn their craft in isolation,<br/>&gt;&gt;away from the influence of keyboards, where they are much more likely to<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;listen to mother nature.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So you still think the &quot;high third&quot; comes from &quot;mother nature&quot;?</p><p>I don&apos;t where the high third comes from. My point here is only that string<br/>players are not as likely to be influenced by keyboards as are singers.<br/>That&apos;s _all. The question of the &quot;high third&quot; is relevant here (as far as I<br/>know).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m aware of the mechanical options available to Handel and others.<br/>&gt; However,<br/>&gt;&gt;keyboard tunings are irrelevant to the basic issue here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you read Daniel Wolf&apos;s reply and Margo&apos;s preview of a reply to the<br/>&gt; issue of whether tonal music arose from tempered instruments or from<br/>&gt; free-pitch instruments? I really think you are operating under an inaccurate<br/>&gt; picture of how this music developed.</p><p>I&apos;m sure that exchange would be interesting, but time restraints being what<br/>they are, I can&apos;t afford the luxury. The reason I assume that it may not be<br/>relevant is that tonal music appears to have been developed vocally in most<br/>world cultures. Sure, that is an assumption on my part, but I am choosing to<br/>believe that instruments--whether tempered or free--had little to do with<br/>the development of tonal music. My experience with &quot;new ears&quot; (as opposed to<br/>&quot;tone deaf) shows that they frequently sing a fourth or fifth below a given<br/>pitch to be matched. I find that very significant and relevant to the point.<br/>I have to believe that the ancients &quot;discovered&quot; tonal music in a similar<br/>way.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, Handel probably composed his<br/>&gt; choral works at the organ (or other keyboard) -- are you suggesting that the<br/>&gt; enharmonic relations in these works would naturally assume a reversed<br/>&gt; direction relative to how Handel heard them if performed by an unaccompanied<br/>&gt; choir?</p><p>No. I&apos;m just suggesting that keyboard tuning was and is irrelevant to the<br/>way ears tend to tune music if left to their own devices. Very likely,<br/>&quot;mistuned&quot; keyboards in Handel&apos;s day were a bane to vocal tuning, just as<br/>they are today.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2000 11:06:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John Link contributed:</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s something Paul Hindemith had to say about the matter:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;A sensitive string player will always find greater pleasure in chamber<br/>&gt; music for strings alone than in music with piano, and the latter seems the<br/>&gt; less pleasant, the more stringed instruments are set against the piano. In<br/>&gt; piano quartets and quintets, the group of instruments capable of pure<br/>&gt; intonation holds the balance even against the tempered instrument.<br/>&gt; Adjustments of the movable tuning to the fixed, which can be made in<br/>&gt; smaller combinations, are hardly possible in such groups. ... The pitches<br/>&gt; of a single instrument capable of pure intonation, on the other hand, are<br/>&gt; easily adapted to the piano (which &quot;gives the pitch&quot;) although mostly<br/>&gt; without the player&apos;s being conscious of the fact.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Hindemith, &quot;The Craft of Musical Composition, Book 1: Theory&quot;, p. 29</p><p>Thanks, John. Hindemith is definitely one of my heroes. It&apos;s very troubling<br/>to me that his view of tonal intervals has been ignored in traditional music<br/>theory textbooks.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2000 11:16:05 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan Stearns said in response to my post:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keyboard tunings are very basic in this case, because the music we are<br/>&gt; talking about was always accompanied by a continuo ensemble (a bass<br/>&gt; instrument + organ, harpsichord or a plucked and fretted string instrument).<br/>&gt; If you really think otherwise, then please give us some examples of vocal<br/>&gt; music by H&#xFFFD;ndel without continuo to discuss.</p><p>Of course I do not think otherwise. Nearly all music in Handel&apos;s day<br/>included a continuo. However, when the keyboard of choice was not an organ<br/>the quickly decaying sounds would allow singers to seek an optimum tuning<br/>(assuming they chose to do so). When an organ was imposing its sustained<br/>pitches, singers would have little choice but to join it. The same is true<br/>today in regard to 12-tET instruments.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/20/2000 11:41:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan Strearns offered:</p><p>&gt; Even without the contributions of xenharmonists and other alternative tuning<br/>&gt; specialists, the conventional concert world enjoys a variety of tunings.</p><p>Of course. Indeed, there are a variety of tunings within a single orchestral<br/>performance given the variety of ears sitting in the ensemble. Most<br/>conductors I have observed today simply say &quot;please tune that up&quot; and seldom<br/>offer any specifics regarding how. If it sounds &quot;good,&quot; print it. It&apos;s<br/>mainly theorists, microtonalists, piano tuners and idiots like me who could<br/>give a rip about _which tuning system is the prevailing standard.</p><p>&gt; The old establishment in conservatory training (and especially Russian<br/>&gt; string players) did indeed emphasize raised sharps and leading tones in the<br/>&gt; pythagorean fashion, theory in hand or not. For a certain amount of<br/>&gt; repertoire, this is probably (for better or worse) the &quot;authentic&quot;<br/>&gt; performance practice, and it is very likely that Mr. Eskelin&apos;s training was<br/>&gt; in this tradition.</p><p>I had no early training one way or the other.</p><p>&gt;  Alternatively, for playing Schoenberg&apos;s twelve-tone<br/>&gt; music, music quite conciously built around properties of 12tet, violinist<br/>&gt; Rudolph Kolisch insisted on tuning his a to the piano and then proceed to<br/>&gt; tune the g, d, and e to the piano as well, insuring that the fifths matched<br/>&gt; the tempered keyboard.</p><p>That makes a lot of sense (and a few cents, as well)  :-)  It would be<br/>interesting to know how &quot;tempered&quot; the sonorities were &quot;on the fly&quot; as<br/>Kolisch placed his fingers on the fretless keyboard. While the intent here<br/>is admirable, it doesn&apos;t necessarily follow that the ear was faithfully<br/>ignored when &quot;chords&quot; were sustained.</p><p>&gt; And finally, the advent of the early music movement<br/>&gt; has led to a significant number of players who _are_ able to tune Major<br/>&gt; thirds narrowly, to keep leading tones low, matching whatever tuning the<br/>&gt; harpsichordist happened to come up with before the concert.</p><p>I&apos;m sure this is true. Paul has made a strong point of this. My only thought<br/>is that there is a danger in assuming that string players in historical<br/>periods were more careful then than now in tuning to keyboards. It might be<br/>a good assumption, but then again it may not. I don&apos;t really care very much<br/>one way or the other. It just seems a bit suspicious, and perhaps naive.<br/>That&apos;s all. No big deal.
