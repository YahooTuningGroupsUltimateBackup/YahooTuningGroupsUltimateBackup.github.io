(For which see<br/><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1768000/1768109">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1768000/1768109</a>.<br/>stm) This hotly debated artifact is thought to be either an ancient<br/>tuning document, or a 10000 year old grocery list. Since I incline to the<br/>former view, I&apos;ve brought it up to date with some comments included in<br/>the Scala scale file; I&apos;ve also attached a midi file retuned according to<br/>this ancient but effective system.</p><p>!

Just a day or 2 ago I was listening to a program on the BBC about replicas of 16th century musical instruments found in the wreck of the Mary Rose (sank in 1545 I think, &amp; raised in 1982). I dug this up: &quot;Sounds from the Seabed&quot; &lt;<a href="http://www.maryrose.org/news/music.htm">http://www.maryrose.org/news/music.htm</a>&gt;. It&apos;s got a low quality Flash audio recording. The radio was a lot clearer, and I love the sound of the &quot;Still Shawm&quot;. They played a tune attributed to Henry VIII. They said it has a &quot;reed at one end, finger-holes, &amp; some keys&quot;. Apparently all the instruments found on the wreck were tuned to the same pitch. Unfortunately they didn&apos;t go into the scale they were tuned to...</p><p>The program then continued with interesting things about &quot;experimental archaeology&quot;.</p><p>Great. Now I&apos;ve got something else to occupy my time with...</p><p>Something about Greek instruments:<br/><a href="http://masseynews.massey.ac.nz/2000/publications/massey_news/november/nov_22/">http://masseynews.massey.ac.nz/2000/publications/massey_news/november/nov_22/</a><br/>stories/early_music.html</p><p>- Joel</p></div>
