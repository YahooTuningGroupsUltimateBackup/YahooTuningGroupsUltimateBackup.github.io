Wim also sent me copies of &quot;Quintierens,&quot; for 24 tone guitar, by Dick Visser, and &quot;Onder Ons,&quot; by Kees Arntzen, which is for 2 guitars tuned a 1/4 tone apart. Other composers in the edition will include Joseph Pehrson, Francisco Luque, Johnny Reinhard, and John Schneider...and Wim is trying to get pieces by Haba and Carillo published as well.<br/>   Of course, getting micro music in print is a wonderful thing; interested guitarists will have some pieces to work on, and this gives folks like me more ammo in their quest to get the larger musical world interested in what we&apos;re doing. Editors like to have something new to write about, and this is a rather unique event, I feel. They&apos;re published by Christine Paquelet Edition Arts, at <a href="http://paquelet-editions.com">paquelet-editions.com</a>. Wim certainly deserves a lot of credit; the manuscripts are beautifully written out, and he&apos;s put years of work into this. He also mentioned that he&apos;s performed the 24 tone duo over 40 times, so folks are hearing it, too. Good stuff...best to all...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick...I've">myspace.com/microstick...I've</a> touched up my page a bit, the guitar pics are much more prominent now...</p></div><h3><a id=67018 href="#67018">ðŸ”—</a>J.Smith &#x3C;jsmith9624@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2006 2:13:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey all...guitar maestro Wim Hoogewerf has been working on getting<br/>some micro guitar pieces in print for the last few years, and I am<br/>honored to say that my 19 tone piece &quot;Mysteries&quot; has just been finished.</p><p>&gt;They&apos;re published by Christine Paquelet Edition Arts, at<br/><a href="http://paquelet-editions.com">paquelet-editions.com</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.paquelet-editions.com">www.paquelet-editions.com</a> &lt;<a href="http://www.paquelet-editions.com">http://www.paquelet-editions.com</a>&gt;</p><p>Congratulations, Neil!</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>jlsmith</p></div>
