Any cell frequency is the product of M, J or U commas by the preceding cell frequency. To reduce product errors 11 decimal digit cells were used, common fractions had to be set aside.</p><p>The progression is able to produce 12 tone scales according to a pair of adders like 50/52, 49/53  provided their sum gives 102. Their values should be about 50.</p><p>When the pair is 49/53, the C# frequency with values comprised within 1 and 2 to be detected in the progression is given by the first number (49), it means that C# frequency corresponds to cell # 49 whose consonant frequency is 1.05707299111. The second adder 53 plus the preceding 49 makes 102 so cell # 102 = 1.12246370821 is D.frequency.</p><p>The first adder 49 works again, it is summed to 102 to give (102 + 49) = 151 so cell # 151 (1.1865234375) is the Eb note frequency.</p><p>Similarly, 151 summed to the second adder 53 gives 204, so cell # 204 = 1.25991918672 is the</p><p>E tone frequency.</p><p>F tone frequency corresponds to cell # (204 + 49) = Cell # 253 = 1.3318294975</p><p>and so forth.</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>As an example, the scale shown below corresponds to pair 51/51. Note that Eb, F# and A tone frequencies of 12 TET and the corresponding cell tones that work in the progression coincide.</p><p>The remaining tone comparisons show very small differences which can be neglected.</p><p>Therefore, a consonant 12 TET cell scale has been drawn from the progression. Should M, J or U values or their sequence are not the ones that work in this set, a useless progression would be the result. How this pair (51/51) succeeded in constructing the 12 TET. I think the job was done by the progression exactness</p><p>May be the tuning list is not interested on this subject since only a few members requested the progression. The 12 TET cell scale shown below is a reason to investigate on this matter.  By now, there is no explanation on what principles were used by the M, J and U commas to settle such abilities.</p><p>I would be pleased to send you the progression (7 pages) as soon as you request it.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p>piagui@...</p><p>Lima, May 05</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>Pair  51/51..........N0TE --PROGRESSION       ----12 TET TONE ----- CELL FREQ. / 12 TET</p><p>ADDER -----Cell Number -----------  CELL FREQUENCIES---FREQUENCIES---TONE FREQUENCIES</p><p>.........# 0.....C...1.............1...........1</p><p>51.......# 51.....C#......1.05946387770....1.05946309436...1.000000739</p><p>51.......# 102.....

Let me add that mysteriously the ratio between the just mentioned cell#624 frequency and (cell # 612)= 2 is the pythagorean comma (1.01364326477051.

In effect you have three much smaller &quot;sruti&quot; generating many more notes.  It is notable that your three are all very similar in size so that the system closely approximates 612-equal (whereas the Indian system does not closely approximate 22-equal).

For future reference, don&apos;t tell people how bad they are at something unless you can back it up, or they may become annoyed. Of course, they may become annoyed anyway, and probably will, but then at least you can back what you said up.</p><p>Anyway, still awaiting the reason for all of this. What&apos;s the point of what you are doing? Why do you need irrational intervals?</p></div>
