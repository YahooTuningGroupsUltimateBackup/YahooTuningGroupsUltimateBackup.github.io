This is my first contribution to microtonal music<br/>sending<br/>E-mails to  a group of musicians I hardly know.  (I&apos;m familiar to some<br/>recent protagonists though.) As a performer, classical guitarist, I&apos;m<br/>involved in microtonal music since many years. Perhaps my experience in this<br/>field may be usefull to some of you. In 1985 I had my classical guitar<br/>equipped with the fine-tuneable fretboard invented by Walter J. Vogt. This<br/>system<br/>contained small individual frets for every string and every position, each<br/>fret moveable up and down around 25 cents. Later Vogt improved his system<br/>and allowed the frets to slide in  continuous rails incorporated in the<br/>neck. I had a second guitar equipped with this new system. Since then every<br/>imaginable division of the octave in twelve (or less) whatsoever steps has<br/>become<br/>possible. On the recent AFMM Festival I played works originally written for<br/>vihuela by Milan, Narvaez and Mudarra in a setting adapted to 5-limit just<br/>intonation. All the thirds were 5:4 or 6:5 and all the fifths were 3:2. Fret<br/>setting of course was adapted to the single tonality of a set of<br/>compositions.<br/>Since the death of Vogt one of his former disciples, Herv&#xFFFD; R. Chouard<br/>continued<br/>his work under the name Fret mobile. Adresse: Fellererstr.2, 85354 Freising,<br/>Germany.(E-mail???) The system has been used with success on the electric<br/>guitar as well. It is interesting to know that originally Walter Vogt was<br/>searching for a way to realize equal temperament on a guitar avoiding all<br/>the problems related to the wellknown poor quality of the classical guitar<br/>string. He was perfectly right: six individual frets in the same position,<br/>electronically accorded to 12ET hardly ever made a perfect straight line,<br/>even if this in theory had to be expected. The possibility of playing in a<br/>most precise way in just intonation or using historical temperaments was a<br/>gift for the musicians that Vogt wasn&apos;t aware of in the beginning...<br/>Musically I consider this invention to be of primary importance for the<br/>classical guitar. I cannot tell however if a rock guitarist will have the<br/>same satisfaction. The typical rock vocabulary uses many bends and vibratos,<br/>which are in fact in contradiction with any system proposing fixed pitches<br/>obtained by prepared settings of the frets.</p><p>From an harmonic point of view the 24 ET system offers some original<br/>starting points. Alois Haba, during his lifetime, stated that every chord<br/>had the right to follow any other chord, independend of it&apos;s traditional<br/>harmonic affection. (That&apos;s what Nirvana does as well!) In his Suite Opus 63<br/>(1947) he uses 24 ET as a 12 ET combined with it&apos;s own projection a<br/>quartertone higher. Chords in itself are built up either from the original<br/>12 ET or from it&apos;s transposition. The chord progression afterwards is<br/>completely without rules, exploiting the entire 24 ET system and seems<br/>improvised<br/>without any thematical emphasis.  I like this Opus 63 a lot and I first<br/>started working on it in 1987 on a 24 ET fretted Vogt guitar. I performed it<br/>again this year on the same AFMM Festival and partly on the MicroFest in Los<br/>Angeles. I will perform it another time 13 September in Prague on a Haba<br/>commemorial concert, using a Kohno with fixed frets in 24ET.</p><p>Dutch bass-player Jeroen Thesseling especially likes the 3/4 tone step (a<br/>virtually perfect 12:11)and fretted his bass-guitar in 8ET. Open strings are<br/>tuned at 9 quartertones from each other thus allowing the frets to be<br/>unbroken , separated by a 3/4 tone for each position. This should work<br/>easily when improvising against diminished chords. Is this an opinion?</p><p>Good luck, Wim (Paris, France)<br/>----------<br/>&gt;De&#xFFFD;: <a href="mailto:basila@txk.net">basila@txk.net</a><br/>&gt;&#xFFFD; : <a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a><br/>&gt;Objet&#xFFFD;: [tuning] More on refretting guitars...<br/>&gt;Date&#xFFFD;: Jeu 5 ao&#xFFFD; 1999 17:22<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:basila@txk.net">basila@txk.net</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I appreciate all the responses I&apos;ve received<br/>&gt; concerning my message of yesterday. But, I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; previously read everything that I was pointed to.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s good information, but it&apos;s not really<br/>&gt; what I was asking for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess what I&apos;m really asking for is opinions.<br/>&gt; I would like a tuning that isn&apos;t just some<br/>&gt; &quot;better Western tuning&quot;. I want something that<br/>&gt; sounds unusual, but nice and melodic. So far,<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve only heard stuff in 19TET, Partch 43, 31TET,<br/>&gt; and some historical tunings. Hence, I don&apos;t have<br/>&gt; a lot of aural experience to work from. I&apos;ll be<br/>&gt; playing somewhat hard progressive rock.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you have refretted a guitar to some &quot;strange&quot;<br/>&gt; tuning, what was it, and why did you pick it<br/>&gt; over the myriad of other choices?
