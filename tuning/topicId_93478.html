One<br/>of the most obvious examples is the academics from different<br/>countries or different periods conflicting.</p><p>For example &quot;22/15: &quot;In a neomedieval style, subfifths around<br/>16:11 are often substituted for regular fifths close to 3:2&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt</a></p><p>Also, the acute minor seventh around 11/6, which I&apos;ve found useful<br/>purely by ear, is very near the 729/400 (acute minor seventh, also<br/>Arabic), which I believe functions in the same manner as a seventh<br/>in common practice theory.  My ear also guided me toward using the<br/>12/11, which is &quot;blasphemy&quot; in common practice theory, yet quite<br/>common in Arab (and perhaps Persian as well) scales.</p><p>Perhaps some of you who&apos;ve read more about these periods could<br/>jump in and give much more elaborate examples and/or more specific<br/>text as well...I&apos;m just trying to touch the tip of the<br/>iceberg here.</p><p>In short, for every so many of the &quot;academic failures&quot; that people<br/>like myself make, there is likely a point in history when such<br/>structures were used.</p><p>So it seems many ideas ARE in a way associated with older or<br/>foreign (literally, from other countries) ideas and many &quot;failures<br/>to understand typical theory&quot; may indeed be able to have ties to<br/>such past/foreign theories...and what&apos;s wrong with that?<br/>If another country/period can make something &quot;illegal&quot; in the<br/>present sound good, why not use it?  At the same time, if something<br/>NOT able to be instantly tied to history sounds good, why not at<br/>least try it (and, perhaps, hand it over to people like those on<br/>this list who can define if such theory does have a not-so-<br/>commonly-known historical basis?)  Sophistry, to me, is simply what<br/>happens when people begin saying &quot;this idea is instantly good<br/>because I have X many papers and calculations to back it up<br/>with&quot;.  This would work if music was primarily a science, thus<br/>involving laws of nature, but it is equally and art and, as such,<br/>can&apos;t be quantified the same way.  Music theory seems more akin to<br/>proving something is likely to work beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><p>So if I have it right Cameron said &quot;Tempering out 81:84 or not is<br/>a very big deal in real life&quot;...and since there is likely no<br/>historical way to prove/disprove this we have to go to surveying<br/>people on the list using un-labelled/&quot;blind&quot; sound examples (IE<br/>where you have to judge dissonance not knowing which sample is<br/>which).</p><p>There is nothing wrong with evaluating parts of music<br/>quantitatively (via math, history, or referencing papers)...<br/>but the fact music is art along with science should mean a<br/>good survey of people believe it sounds should be at least<br/>equally weighed in determining a theory as valid/invalid,<br/>correct?</p></div>
