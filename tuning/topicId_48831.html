It can read Scala<br/>tuning files, which are also freely available in a separate<br/>distribution (well over 3000 different tunings) from the same<br/>website.  It can export those Scala files into MTS files (.mid, .syx)<br/>for your MTS-compatible gear.</p><p>Alternatively, look into LMSO<br/>(<a href="http://www.nonoctave.com/tuning/LilMissScaleOven/">http://www.nonoctave.com/tuning/LilMissScaleOven/</a>), which offers a<br/>bigger feature set for the price.  I use Max Magic Microtuner because<br/>I don&apos;t need any features right now beyond exporting tuning files to<br/>MTS files.</p><p>I am a Mac OS X user, so be aware I haven&apos;t looked much into the Mac<br/>OS 9 soft synth offerings.  For OS X, we are pretty much limited to<br/>Native Instruments&apos; soft synths and LinPlug&apos;s CronoX.  Of NI&apos;s soft<br/>synths, only FM7 and Pro53 can load tuning files of some kind.<br/>Absynth reportedly has tuning capability but it can&apos;t load tuning<br/>files - all tuning must be done manually.  CronoX is VST-only on OS<br/>X - a VST-AU wrapper must be purchased if you want to use it as an<br/>AU.  I limited my soft synth search to AU (Audio Unit) compatible<br/>offerings because the sequencer I use (Numerology) happens to be an<br/>AU host.</p><p>I currently use FM7 because the local shop sells it for $189, which<br/>is not much more than the cost CronoX + VST-AU wrapper software.  And<br/>I don&apos;t already have hardware synths.  One caveat about FM7 for OS X -<br/> it currently has a minor stuck-note problem which happens when I<br/>play it directly from a hardware keyboard, but not when I trigger it<br/>with Numerology.  Numerology&apos;s author is an NI beta user - he put in<br/>a tweak to compensate for FM7&apos;s stuck note problem.</p><p>The other soft synth solutions for the Mac that I am aware of are<br/>the &quot;roll your own&quot; type in which you are provided a toolkit to build<br/>your own synth (Max/MSP, CSound, etc.).  FM7 was just the quickest<br/>solution for me.</p><p>Good luck,<br/>Paolo</p></div>
