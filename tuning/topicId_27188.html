This card has the ability to use system ram to load<br/>soundfont files, which greatly improves the quality of the sounds. Midi piano<br/>is one of the most realistic of the sounds for a lot of the cards or synths<br/>I&apos;ve used. Percussion is probably the next best from the multitude of junk<br/>I&apos;ve collected or used. Most other sounds, however, are going to sound<br/>horrible on a crappy card, but will still work.</p><p>Although for non midi stuff you can miss out on cool stuff that cards offer<br/>nowadays, and there is some extremely cool stuff around, if you dont care to<br/>much about that stuff then cheap is good. A few years ago maybe speakers were<br/>more important for non midi, but now there are some awesome features you can<br/>miss out on with crappy cards. If you dont care about some of the new<br/>features like remote controls, dolby 5.1, quad speakers, optical in/out,<br/>front bays for easy recording and midi access, and lots more then go cheap.<br/>Most anything will work for crappy midi sounds.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Andy</p></div><h3><a id=27236 href="#27236">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/22/2001 11:38:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JoJoBuBu@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_27188.html#27191">/tuning/topicId_27188.html#27191</a></p><p>&gt; Most anything will work for crappy midi sounds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Andy</p><p>Actually... for the gentleman who wanted to know about sound cards...<br/>I am *amazed* at the difference in quality between them.

Its deffinitely worth it if you dont want ridiculously horrible<br/>sounding midi and even non-midi, but the crappy ones will work. As I said in<br/>my post though if you are going to buy a new one for midi sounds get a sound<br/>blaster live, not a soundblaster 64. The reason is because with the<br/>soundblaster live you can assign system ram to soundfont files, which makes a<br/>gigantic difference. It doesn&apos;t matter which SBLive you get for midi sounds,<br/>although the SB live platinum has midi inputs, and more stuff, on a front bay<br/>which is very handy.</p><p>Laters,<br/>Andy</p></div><h3><a id=27322 href="#27322">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/23/2001 8:20:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JoJoBuBu@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_27188.html#27276">/tuning/topicId_27188.html#27276</a></p><p>&gt; Oh hell yes.
