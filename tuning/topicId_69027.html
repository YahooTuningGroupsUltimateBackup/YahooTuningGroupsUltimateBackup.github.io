Besides the Brandenberg&apos;s, Koopman may have a concerto here and there in WIII.  But when I heard him do Bach&apos;s Christmas Cantata in Lincoln Center, it was in ET.</p><p>Re squiggles, just can&apos;t make the leap of faith.  Ornamentation of this kind was typical without having hidden codes contained within.  Carl&apos;s 3 examples does show a difference between the 3 tunings represented.  Haven&apos;t heard the Goldberg in squiggle.  If I come across it, I&apos;ll certainly give it a listen.  But Bach works in any well temperament, period.</p><p>all best, Johnny</p><p>p.s.  man, I&apos;ve wanted to weigh in on &quot;soul&quot; but don&apos;t think I could take any more heat. ;)<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.
