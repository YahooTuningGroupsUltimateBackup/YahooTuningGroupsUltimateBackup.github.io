Oh, sorry; wrong list. ;-)</p><p>Anyone out there use a Yamaha FSR-1 for microtonal music making?<br/>I have been considering getting one, but it&apos;s not micro-tunable<br/>out of the box, so I guess one would need to use the pitch-bend method<br/>in real-time. Is anyone doing this?</p><p>Does anyone have software, in C-source-code form for Windows,<br/>that can read an incoming MIDI stream in real-time; parse out<br/>note-ons; adjust them via pitch-bend in real-time; then send<br/>to MIDI-out?

But I&apos;m not quite ready to share<br/>it.  You could go to Justonic and buy their stuff.  I&apos;m likely going<br/>to buy it soon to compare with mine.  My hunch now is that mine is<br/>better for my purposes.
