The Piagui D major chord graph obtained in the past do not show periodicity but only aesthetics while Piagui D minor chord wave peak graph presented some degree of discordance that has been detected recently.</p><p>Both Justharm II, D maj and D min graph responses are really fine so I will process the remaining major and minor triads as well as sevenths, augmented and diminished chords. Probably, I am near to a great news item.</p><p>Each of the two graphs weights about 450 KB, page A4. If you want to get only one response or boths, you only need to ask them (Word, PDF- The weights are about the same).</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro<br/>piagui@...<br/>Lima, November 27, 2009</p></div>
