I didnt tell a<br/>&gt;lot of people how i lost so much because i wanted to try this stuff before i<br/>&gt;recommended it to anyone. This was all over TV and I was reluctant to try it but<br/>&gt;it really did work well for me. If you are trying to lose weight for the new<br/>&gt;year i highly recommend you try John Hopkins University Formula<br/>&gt;</p><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;Banned! Hulk smash!&quot;</p><p>    And there&apos;s always the temptation to try and trace the e-mail back whoever<br/>sent it and, if their e-mail server is private (IE it won&apos;t affect anyone but<br/>their most-likely-not-legal company), perform a Denial of Service attack so<br/>their easy ability to engage in spamming habits can rest in peace... :-D</p></div>
