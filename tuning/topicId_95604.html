I didnt tell a<br/>&gt;lot of people how i lost so much because i wanted to try this stuff before i<br/>&gt;recommended it to anyone. This was all over TV and I was reluctant to try it but<br/>&gt;it really did work well for me. If you are trying to lose weight for the new<br/>&gt;year i highly recommend you try John Hopkins University Formula<br/>&gt;</p><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;Banned!
