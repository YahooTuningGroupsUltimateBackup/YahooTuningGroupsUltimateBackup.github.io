Using pandit Young as a template for my own explorations in Just Intonation has been a fruitful excercise. The minimal &quot;gharana&quot; that he established, while there have been occaisonal detractors, remains one of the most solid and impacting elements on the &quot;underground&quot; american art/music scene. I am continuing my explorations that i began in the summer of 98. At that point i was collaborating with a friend on a piece entitled &quot;Pixel 31&quot; which employed about 16 sines with extended duaration. After visiting the dreamhouse in 99 i felt that my work of replicating La Montes installations (quite often a student in the hindu musical tradition will constantly try to imitate the masters inflection, tone and of course pitch while rendering a raga.) seemed quite pre-cognitive and my understanding of and assimilation of the aesthetic was as i felt, solid. Nonetheless<br/>i have chosen to continue -recontinue my studies, now focusing on some of the earlier Dream Music theorized and composed by Young.<br/>The development of Real-time Csound <a href="http://www.csounds.org">http://www.csounds.org</a> has enabled me to proceed &quot;click free&quot; into the sustained harmonic relationships previously limited by CPU speed and memeory allocations.<br/>As well, the wonderful work of Peter Blasser _-(who i have still been unable to contact) <a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/~pblasser/orch.html">http://www.oberlin.edu/~pblasser/orch.html</a><br/>places  ratios within brackets in simple rational form ex: [49/32]. making the compositional/replication process extremely easy to understand.</p><p>I would love to hear from any of you regarding the Dream Music, your opinions about the tunings and any ideas for collaboration and or performances you all might entertain.<br/>All i ask is that you refrain from flames about conrad, and the table of the elements shenanigans</p><p>Pat Pagano, Director<br/>South East Just Intonation Society<br/><a href="http://www.screwmusicforever.com/SHREESWIFT/">http://www.screwmusicforever.com/SHREESWIFT/</a></p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2002 4:26:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt;From: shreeswifty</p><p>&gt;As you all may or may not know i have been studying the<br/>&gt;compositions of La Monte Young for quite a long time.</p><p>Whatta ya know.

The arts that still are populated by souls who<br/>would never dream of making a *real* living out of it (dance,<br/>performance art, theatre) are still risk-taking.</p><p>I&apos;d love to hear about the performances that, while music-based, go<br/>beyond notes and rhythms and tunings, because while I try my damdest<br/>to keep abreast, it seems bleak. And to Alison&apos;s mention of the<br/>underground, there *are* a minority of musicians that have taken<br/>influence in a larger sense, and do want to synthsize more aspects of<br/>performance and the performance event into an absorbing experience,<br/>but they are operating on the fringes and in the shadows. They are<br/>marginal players, even as they are important ones.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if it is a pendulum or a straight path. I&apos;m hoping for<br/>the former, and figuring it&apos;s the latter; if so, my days in &quot;music&quot;<br/>are numbered, because if I die I don&apos;t want it to be of boredom,<br/>complacency, or fear.</p><p>Sorry I don&apos;t know more about LaMonte!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2002 1:05:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David Beardsley wrote:</p><p>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; &gt;From: shreeswifty<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;As you all may or may not know i have been studying the<br/>&gt; &gt;compositions of La Monte Young for quite a long time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whatta ya know.

Young&apos;s work with tunings is similar to Partch (to me)<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; that it enables all that come after it to reference a point (a stepdown<br/>if<br/>&gt; &gt; you will ) of intuitive understanding of the nature of vibration,<br/>harmonics<br/>&gt; &gt; and really the &quot;dream&quot; --a dreamer that remains or a dreamhouse --you<br/>&gt; &gt; choose --we are all in.

I imagine you have some of Kraig&apos;s<br/>stuff?  Michael Harrison&apos;s From Ancient Worlds is essential.<br/>Other Music has put out two delightful albums.  And Doty&apos;s<br/>latest is also essential.</p><p>Terry Riley&apos;s The Harp of New Albion is cool to play on<br/>occasion.
