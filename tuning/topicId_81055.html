Popularity in most pop music senses is a mene if I have the term right - it is the equivalent of a computer virus - a thought or pattern that appeals to the listener - even agaist their will (at first). There have been studies about this. Now much what I have heard microtonally is &quot;in your face&quot; this is different for the sake of being different. I suggest one won&apos;t win too many more fans this way than Schoenberg did.</p><p>It is all great to explore and I myself do tons of exploration but it isn&apos;t going to appeal to the masses. If you produce something that sounds catchy - has a real hook - I think it will have a chance to fly.</p><p>In otherwords the general public does not care what tuning system you use. All that matters is that they like it. In other words the vast majority isn&apos;t going to care if I have a mustang or stratocaster. They just want something they like. Even different - even radically different - is ok if it has appeal of some type.</p><p>If you want popularity you need one or more hooks. Technique does not matter. Heck most of the time true talent isn&apos;t part of that equation. Please let&apos;s all get out of the box if popularity is the goal.</p><p>Face it. Experiments are for geeks.

Generally melodic dissonace and experimentation preceded<br/>harmonic usage pretty consitantly. Some times by a little, often by a lot of<br/>time.

Just ask any guy who tracks break<br/>beats. That is much more diffcult than pressing &quot;play&quot;. And they go through<br/>the trouble to learn is because they like it.

For example, jazz is now a borderline (and if<br/>&gt; it weren&apos;t for Brad Mehldau, The Bad Plus, etc, would<br/>&gt; already be a fullblown) classical form. &quot;Experimental<br/>&gt; music&quot; is popular music in this sense, even if it is<br/>&gt; content with small audiences. Some evidence suggests<br/>&gt; that all forms will have to be content with small<br/>&gt; audiences in the near future -- the so-called &quot;long tail&quot;<br/>&gt; hypothesis.

So if you really want to improve your scales etc... I --suggest that you IMMERSE yourself in musical tradition instead of arguing about the<br/>--&quot;right to be original&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp; Feel free to prove me wrong.&nbsp; But, to the best of my experimentation (and looking at scales such as Ptolemy&apos;s scales...it seems &quot;historical&quot; musical theory eventually seems to point straight at Just Intonation as the ultimate tuning.&nbsp; And yet testing by my ear and others seems to say JI is not quite ideal.<br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/>&nbsp;.&nbsp; And forming straight JI scales like 6/5 7/5 8/5 9/5 10/5 11/5 12/5 seems to have a limit.&nbsp; At about the 16th harmonic or so critical band becomes more of an issue than the &quot;harmonic distortion&quot; caused by the constant beating between JI notes can help resolve.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;ve created about 10 JI scales, doing everything from straight series like the above to &quot;reverse harmonic&quot; scales like 12/11 * 11/10 * 10/9 * 11/10 * 10/9 to testing them again 5-limit and 7-limit JI scales.&nbsp; Note those scales DO use the same ratios many of Ptolemy&apos;s scales did, but the order in which they are used (at least) is drastically different.</p><p>&nbsp; And they all seem to have the same &quot;limit&quot;.&nbsp; Carl suggestion just using the harmonic series is #1) 10/9 11/9&nbsp; 12/9 13/9 14/9 15/9 16/9 17/9 18/9...but I did a blind test on myself and about 8 people I knew (most of them who&apos;d never heard anything other than 12TET)...<br/>...and 7 of them thought #2) 9/8 * 10/9 * 11/10 * 12/11 * 10/9 * 11/10 * 12/11 sounded better with all notes played together.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; True, you could go another level and say &quot;but #1 allows more chords&quot; or &quot;7-limit JI allows more chords&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp; Then again, what kind of musicians exactly would we be aiming such relearning at IE how much of a chance are their common musicians will be willing to assimilate a music theory more complex than the one they already have spent so long learning (IE 12TET, a close cousin of 5-limit JI)?</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &nbsp; As a hopefully reasonable challenge, Rick...what&apos;s the BEST historical scale system, in your opinion, and where can I read up on how it works (so I can eventually compare it to my own research and efforts)?&nbsp;<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>------------------------<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; So (so far) I am still convinced there is a hole in the system and many things, now that we have so much technology around, that we can solve which tuning wizards of, say, the 18th and 19th century could not.&nbsp; And, I&apos;m well open, thanks to people like William Sethares, to the idea that radically different tuning methods from JI CAN work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have an &quot;unfair advantage&quot; vs. historical tuning expert with modern technology...in the same way modern scientists have an unfair advantage over even the most ingenious ancient ones, and, so far, it&apos;s my opinion so far that we can solve problems which were &quot;impossible&quot; before with it...and possibly find methods radically different from old ones that work as well or better.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So far I&apos;ve learned things like attempt to obey the critical-band and trying to enforce harmonic-distortion/periodicity are always important to tuning regardless of the method used.&nbsp; Also universal is the order of intervals apparently always matters IE major, largest to smallest...always sounds better than minor or smallest to largest REGARDLESS of the fact the calculated dissonance is the same.&nbsp; But these can all be tied back to psychoacoustics and the way the human ear is designed...on the most basic level.<br/>---------------<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But so far as several other historical assumptions, like being stuck to whole-number ratios and/or JI....I am not 100% convinced of they are &quot;universal rule&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just for kicks, you might want to try listening to my latest &quot;PHITER&quot; scale at, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/djtrancendance/...which">http://www.geocities.com/djtrancendance/...which</a> 100% does not follow JI, and try explaining to me how it relates to historical tuning (or, if you think it doesn&apos;t work well, what historical tuning principles I&apos;m disobeying that may improve it).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; ....So far said above tuning has had better response than virtually all my JI scales, including onces based on a simple straight harmonic series.</p><p>-Michael</p><p>--- On Sat, 2/14/09, rick_ballan &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt;

In<br/>jazz theory, a lot of these scales, like Dorian mode, for example, are<br/>often mentioned in terms of the relationship of each note to the root.<br/>For example, Dorian mode has a minor 3rd, a major 6th, a major second,<br/>etc. This is how ear training is taught here - if it&apos;s minor, listen<br/>for the natural 2 and natural 6 and see if it&apos;s Dorian or not.

In<br/>&gt; jazz theory, a lot of these scales, like Dorian mode, for example, are<br/>&gt; often mentioned in terms of the relationship of each note to the root.<br/>&gt; For example, Dorian mode has a minor 3rd, a major 6th, a major second,<br/>&gt; etc. This is how ear training is taught here - if it&apos;s minor, listen<br/>&gt; for the natural 2 and natural 6 and see if it&apos;s Dorian or not. So it&apos;s<br/>&gt; an unordered pitch-collection concept, and it applies usually to refer<br/>&gt; to what mode or key a piece is in, as in &quot;this was written in Dorian<br/>&gt; mode.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But if I say &quot;play a Dorian scale&quot;, people will assume the notes are<br/>&gt; going to be played in the order of D-E-F-G-A-etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s the difference between referring to the major scale and saying<br/>&gt; that a piece is &quot;in major.&quot; The reference to the major scale is<br/>&gt; probably going to evoke imagery of an ascending C-D-E-F-G-etc pattern,<br/>&gt; and the concept of a piece being &quot;in major&quot; is going to refer to an<br/>&gt; unordered pitch collection. It doesn&apos;t matter if the major third is on<br/>&gt; top of the fifth, just that it&apos;s there for the piece to count as being<br/>&gt; &quot;in major.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand this is different from how common-practice theory labels<br/>&gt; modes and such, but the terminology is so widespread around here I<br/>&gt; might as well chip in and mention it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2009 7:14:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>---One thing that keeps coming up...is my giving Chris a tuning AND a<br/>scale and suggesting ---he use the XXXtuningXXX...only to have him make an<br/>example with the tuning and say he is using ---my &quot;scale&quot;.<br/>And I&apos;ll plead mine...that last sentence should have read</p><p>One thing that keeps coming up...is my giving Chris a tuning AND a<br/>scale and suggesting -he use the !!SCALE!!

Jazz harmony sometimes can&apos;t be explained only as based on classical third structure, there are also quartal chords and combination of thirdal and quartal harmony, or even bi-chordal or poly-chordal combinations.</p><p>It&apos;s important to understand another thing essential for music composition, which is work with intervals. It&apos;s applicable to any system, be it pentatonic, diatonic, chromatic, microtonal, modal, tonal, atonal, dodecaphonic, serial... And it&apos;s responsible for creating basic atmosphere of composition, much more than scale itself. If scale is subset of tuning, then series used as a melodic motif is a subset of scale and is based on work with selected intervals inside the scale. Scale is ordered, series can be considered unordered, as there are jumps, small, bigger intervals between adjacent notes, even repeated notes which all scale itself hasn&apos;t.</p><p>For example inside 7-tone diatonics we can create series which are based on small intervals with rare bigger intervalic jumps (typical for vocal music), or series with bigger intervals (typical for instrumental melodies). Melodies using let&apos;s say seconds, thirds and fifths will sound differently than motifs using seconds, fourths and sevenths. Relations between notes in series can follow relations in tonality, but as well we can compose atonal diatonic melody which doesn&apos;t follow classical rules, and has no central tone, dominant etc. In extreme we can have diatonic pointilistic structure with very big intervals, yet still diatonic or even tonal (which would be maybe difficult to consider as tonal when hearing).<br/>Opposite we can create 12-tone dodecaphonic series which sound quite modal or tonal, even diatonic (do you know Alban Berg&apos;s Violin Concerto?). Everything depends on interval selection.</p><p>Another simple example of extended 12-tone music is to combine diatonic on white keys of piano with pentatonic on black keys. Together they create 12-tone music, but not so boring like pure dodecaphony which sound often too sterile. Here every layer in music uses different principle (even more principles are hidden inside, thanks to different modes). In the extreme use With the help of a clever selected tones from both layers any music can be simulated by a clever selection of tones from both layers. In the frame of this system we can easily travel from modality to tonality to atonality, from pentatonics to chromatics. Motifs can be created as tonal or serial. Besides it&apos;s possible to jump to folklorism easily, as with traditional scales hidden here lot of traditional associations are connected.</p><p>I personally consider this very important point, and in my compositions I extensively work with this attitude. Thus is possible to create even such unusual combinations like &quot;diatonized chromatics&quot;, &quot;chromatized diatonics&quot;, &quot;atonal tonality&quot;, &quot;tonal atonality&quot;, &quot;serial modality&quot;, &quot;modal seriality&quot; etc. This border field offers still a lot.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 17 Feb 2009, at 12:11 PM, Chris Vaisvil wrote:</p><p>&gt; Mike,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am curious, if Jazz considers a scale a collection of unordered &gt; pitches, what would define a mode?<br/>&gt; I can, of course, understand minor / major distinction, but when &gt; one shifts for a mode the collection of pitches does not change - &gt; only the tonic you wish to emphasize by taking advantage of melodic &gt; interval relationships.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps I&apos;m a little confused, and perhaps I don&apos;t understand jazz &gt; well at all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another point is - what makes the unordered collection of scale &gt; pitches different from say the more  liberal interpretations of 12-&gt; tone serialist music?

Jazz harmony sometimes can&apos;t be explained only as based<br/>&gt; on classical third structure, there are also quartal chords and<br/>&gt; combination of thirdal and quartal harmony, or even bi-chordal or<br/>&gt; poly-chordal combinations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s important to understand another thing essential for music<br/>&gt; composition, which is work with intervals. It&apos;s applicable to any<br/>&gt; system, be it pentatonic, diatonic, chromatic, microtonal, modal,<br/>&gt; tonal, atonal, dodecaphonic, serial... And it&apos;s responsible for<br/>&gt; creating basic atmosphere of composition, much more than scale<br/>&gt; itself. If scale is subset of tuning, then series used as a melodic<br/>&gt; motif is a subset of scale and is based on work with selected<br/>&gt; intervals inside the scale. Scale is ordered, series can be<br/>&gt; considered unordered, as there are jumps, small, bigger intervals<br/>&gt; between adjacent notes, even repeated notes which all scale itself<br/>&gt; hasn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example inside 7-tone diatonics we can create series which are<br/>&gt; based on small intervals with rare bigger intervalic jumps (typical<br/>&gt; for vocal music), or series with bigger intervals (typical for<br/>&gt; instrumental melodies). Melodies using let&apos;s say seconds, thirds and<br/>&gt; fifths will sound differently than motifs using seconds, fourths and<br/>&gt; sevenths. Relations between notes in series can follow relations in<br/>&gt; tonality, but as well we can compose atonal diatonic melody which<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t follow classical rules, and has no central tone, dominant<br/>&gt; etc. In extreme we can have diatonic pointilistic structure with very<br/>&gt; big intervals, yet still diatonic or even tonal (which would be maybe<br/>&gt; difficult to consider as tonal when hearing).<br/>&gt; Opposite we can create 12-tone dodecaphonic series which sound quite<br/>&gt; modal or tonal, even diatonic (do you know Alban Berg&apos;s Violin<br/>&gt; Concerto?). Everything depends on interval selection.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another simple example of extended 12-tone music is to combine<br/>&gt; diatonic on white keys of piano with pentatonic on black keys.<br/>&gt; Together they create 12-tone music, but not so boring like pure<br/>&gt; dodecaphony which sound often too sterile. Here every layer in music<br/>&gt; uses different principle (even more principles are hidden inside,<br/>&gt; thanks to different modes). In the extreme use With the help of a<br/>&gt; clever selected tones from both layers any music can be simulated by<br/>&gt; a clever selection of tones from both layers. In the frame of this<br/>&gt; system we can easily travel from modality to tonality to atonality,<br/>&gt; from pentatonics to chromatics. Motifs can be created as tonal or<br/>&gt; serial. Besides it&apos;s possible to jump to folklorism easily, as with<br/>&gt; traditional scales hidden here lot of traditional associations are<br/>&gt; connected.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I personally consider this very important point, and in my<br/>&gt; compositions I extensively work with this attitude.

Jazz harmony sometimes can&apos;t be explained only as based<br/>&gt; on classical thirdal structure, there are also quartal chords and<br/>&gt; combination of thirdal and quartal harmony, or even bi-chordal or<br/>&gt; poly-chordal combinations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s important to understand another thing essential for music<br/>&gt; composition, which is work with intervals. It&apos;s applicable to any<br/>&gt; system, be it pentatonic, diatonic, chromatic, microtonal, modal,<br/>&gt; tonal, atonal, dodecaphonic, serial... And it&apos;s responsible for<br/>&gt; creating basic atmosphere of composition, much more than scale<br/>&gt; itself. If scale is subset of tuning, then series used as a melodic<br/>&gt; motif is a subset of scale and is based on work with selected<br/>&gt; intervals inside the scale. Scale is ordered, series can be<br/>&gt; considered unordered, as there are jumps, smaller or bigger intervals<br/>&gt; between adjacent notes, even repeated notes - which all scale itself<br/>&gt; hasn&apos;t. Scale is abstract theoretical term (but of course used in &gt; passages in some music styles - Classicism, Romantism...), series &gt; made from scale notes represent music itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example inside 7-tone diatonics we can create series which are<br/>&gt; based on small intervals with rare bigger intervallic jumps (typical<br/>&gt; for vocal music), or series with bigger intervals (typical for<br/>&gt; instrumental melodies). Melodies using let&apos;s say seconds, thirds and<br/>&gt; fifths will sound differently than motifs using seconds, fourths and<br/>&gt; sevenths. Relations between notes in series can follow relations in<br/>&gt; tonality, but as well we can compose atonal diatonic melody which<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t follow classical rules, and has no central tone, dominant<br/>&gt; etc. In extreme we can have diatonic pointilistic structure with very<br/>&gt; big intervals, yet still diatonic or even tonal (which would be maybe<br/>&gt; difficult to consider as tonal when hearing).<br/>&gt; On the other side we can create 12-tone dodecaphonic series which &gt; sound quite<br/>&gt; modal or tonal, even diatonic (do you know Alban Berg&apos;s Violin<br/>&gt; Concerto?). Everything depends on interval selection.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another simple example of extended 12-tone music is to combine<br/>&gt; diatonics on white keys of piano with pentatonics on black keys.<br/>&gt; Together they create 12-tone music, but not so boring like pure<br/>&gt; dodecaphony which sound often too sterile. Here every layer in music<br/>&gt; uses different principle (even more principles are hidden inside,<br/>&gt; thanks to different modes). In the extreme use any music can be &gt; simulated by<br/>&gt; a clever selection of tones from both layers. In the frame of this<br/>&gt; system we can easily travel from modality to tonality to atonality,<br/>&gt; from pentatonics to chromatics. Motifs can be created as modal, &gt; tonal or<br/>&gt; serial. Besides it&apos;s possible to jump to folklorism easily, as with<br/>&gt; traditional scales hidden here lot of traditional associations are<br/>&gt; connected.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I personally consider this very important point, and in my<br/>&gt; compositions I extensively work with this attitude.

Tempo, rhythm,<br/>timbre of instruments, dynamics and many other things can set the mood<br/>of a piece as much as its scales and chords. The only way pitch<br/>influences mood is probably in higher pitches being &quot;happier&quot; than lower<br/>ones, or in consonance and dissonance. And mood isn&apos;t a purely dualistic<br/>thing: you also have pride, fear, anger, apathy...</p><p>Partch, on p. 155 of &quot;Genesis&quot;, has a &quot;one-footed bride&quot;, a diagram of<br/>43 ratios within an octave and how they may set moods and other<br/>aesthetics in music.

If we limit the JI &quot;major&quot; scale to<br/>&gt; &gt; just those ratios posted above, that makes it more limiting than the<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-et major scale. So why not let that 5/3 drift by 81/80 as needed,<br/>&gt; &gt; and still say that it&apos;s part of the major scale? In fact, why not let<br/>&gt; &gt; any of the notes drift by 81/80 as needed?

For me intervals between<br/>&gt; neighboring notes, because this way you count also musical context,<br/>&gt; how music is developed in time. Note only abstractly when we see all<br/>&gt; notes written on paper and can them analyse together on one sight,<br/>&gt; but how music works in real time, that means sequentially note by<br/>&gt; note (now I&apos;m talking only about one voice melody).<br/>&gt; &gt; It still begs the question: are the Hijaz-type modes &quot;major&quot;, &quot;minor&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; both or neither?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Doesn&apos;t it depend on third? Then it&apos;s easy to say.<br/>&gt; &gt; The augmented second adds an emotion not found in the &quot;church modes&quot;,<br/>&gt; &gt; including natural minor, but found in harmonic minor.

And melody doesn&apos;t need to be in 7tone diatonics, it can be in minor pentatonics. This is typical for blues, where in fact minor and major gender are mixed.
