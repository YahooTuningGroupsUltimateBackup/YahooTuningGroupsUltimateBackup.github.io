This bass was fretted to<br/>&gt; 12th root of two. Back home I transferred the recording to my<br/>&gt; digital audio workstation then used it to find the exact frequency<br/>&gt; of the 24 notes. I then calculated the error between the expected<br/>&gt; frequency (given the fret placing) and the actual frequency (due to<br/>&gt; increased string tension).</p><p>Fascinating!  How much error was there in cents and millimeters of fret<br/>placement?  How did the 19 tone bass come out?  What was the accuracy?  What<br/>did the luthier have to change to make it more accurate?</p><p>If you sampled a single string on a single bass, you may have measured the<br/>accuracy of the string winding (or wear on the sting) as much as the<br/>fretting job.</p><p>You are correct, no guitar plays perfectly in tune.  This is much more<br/>important with JI than with equal temperaments, but there is a limit to how<br/>well frets ever play in tune.  A player can change the pitch of a note by<br/>fretting it harder or lighter, picking harder or lighter, or fretting right<br/>next to the fret or far away.</p><p>I have had this theory that Zappa tuned his guitar a few cents flat and<br/>controlled the exact intonation with finger pressure.  Listen to an album of<br/>his solos and see if you hear the same thing.</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>Peterson Stringed Instruments<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson">http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson</a></p></div>
