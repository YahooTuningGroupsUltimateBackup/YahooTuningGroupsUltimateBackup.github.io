For example,<br/>microtonal support.</p><p>I do not know anything about vietnamese music, but I am willing to bet<br/>that some of their music uses tuning systems other than 12-edo.</p><p>It would be a good idea to write a comment on the voting page,<br/>informing the vi_VN supporters of the tuning issue and how they can<br/>potentially benefit from it.</p><p>If you want to show your support for microtonal tuning in Java, I<br/>encourage you to reply to this message on the tuning list. Your reply<br/>should explain why alternative tunings are important for the<br/>vietnamese culture.</p><p>If the response to the present message justifies it, I will then post<br/>your replies on the appropriate page of Sun&apos;s website.</p><p>7Kami</p></div>
