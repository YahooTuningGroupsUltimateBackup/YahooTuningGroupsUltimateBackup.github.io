I think it<br/>&gt; would be more in our interest to advocate a Bosanquet keyboard on<br/>the<br/>&gt; accordion and elsewhere.  A chromatic keyboard is not going to make<br/>&gt; alternative tuning systems more practical, nor will the experience<br/>of<br/>&gt; learning 12-ET on a chromatic keyboard enable anyone to play any<br/>&gt; alternative tuning systems that have other than 12 tones in the<br/>&gt; octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George</p><p>In taking another look at the chromatic accordion keyboard, I<br/>realized that if you replace the reeds in the instrument with ones<br/>tuned to 19-ET, the tones would be arranged exactly as on the<br/>Bosanquet generalized keyboard, except that the rows of keys are not<br/>slanted.  And with slanted rows I think that the construction would<br/>not be much different from what it is now.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=40827 href="#40827">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/2002 11:58:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ...
