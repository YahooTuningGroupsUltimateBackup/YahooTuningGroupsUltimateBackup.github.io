He&apos;s not as well known as, say, Mike<br/>Stern, but does a lot of NYC/Europe gigs, and has played with a lot of<br/>well known folks...that&apos;s a good thing. Funny, though..he just did a<br/>lesson for Guitar Player, talked about this weird mode hes uses, but<br/>never mentioned alt tunings. On that note, none of the major music mags<br/>seem interested at all in this...although JazzTimes did a recent profile<br/>on Joe Maneri that was very well done.<br/>   Seth, you mentioned tuning with 5ths for JI guitars...I have recently<br/>tuned one of my fretlesses to a pure tuning of 1/1, 5/4, 3/2, 7/4,<br/>35/32, and 21/16...I performed a new piece in this tuning, and it works<br/>very well. I also tuned my fretless acoustic to a koto pentatonic scale,<br/>which was quite nice for &quot;Sakura.&quot; Tuning to the scale you&apos;re playing<br/>is, of course, what Indian musicians do...I like it because it also<br/>means I have the harmonics of the scale at my disposal, and it enables<br/>me to hear/find the notes I want easier. I plan on getting a 9 string<br/>fretless someday...it would open up new doors. In fact, there&apos;s a very<br/>good guitarist in LA, Paul Livingstone, who has a 9 string<br/>fretless..anybody heard him? I like this sort of thread, because it<br/>means we&apos;re looking at ways to take these concepts to the larger world<br/>of music....Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=16679 href="#16679">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>12/18/2000 9:57:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I like this sort of thread, because it<br/>&gt; means we&apos;re looking at ways to take these concepts to the larger<br/>world<br/>&gt; of music....Hstick</p><p>Neil,</p><p>I&apos;ll second that motion!

They keep it simple,<br/>equating JI intervals with rational intergers. (I think,<br/>I don&apos;t have the copy with me.) I wouldn&apos;t<br/>have been so quick to run out and buy a Korg<br/>MS2000R if Keyboard didn&apos;t mention it was tunable.</p><p>Jon Catler told me this afternoon that a recent<br/>issue of Acoustic Guitar has an article about<br/>some Northern European microtonalists. I&apos;ll<br/>be checking out the newstand for that one later<br/>today.</p><p>Guitar Player reviewed the Godin acoustic fretless<br/>recently.</p><p>Electronic Musican ran an article on microtonality<br/>sometime in the past few years.
