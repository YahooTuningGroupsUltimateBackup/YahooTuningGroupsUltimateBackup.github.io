Thanks for all the discussion that I&apos;ve been lurking around reading.</p><p>&gt;I wondered if others on this group have similar experiences, and how &gt;some &gt;cope with switching from one tuning to another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Mark</p><p>Yes, it happens to me all the time, having been cursed with close to perfect pitch, and so ingrained on equal tempered piano most of my life that other tuning systems are difficult for me to appreciate appropriately, as I try to fit it into my perspective, and yes, it can cause vertigo type symptoms, funny enough that is where balance is centered, in the ears. So it isn&apos;t that odd, really. I&apos;ve found that I can have a &quot;movable Do&quot; with my perfect pitch, so that I don&apos;t go totally nuts if something is a touch flat or sharp, fortunately.</p><p>Over the years I&apos;ve played a lot of synthesizer stretching and compressing from the standard 1 volt per octave into other tuning systems, but since most synths have standard piano type of keyboards it is hard to visualize the tunings on that kind of keyboard, and I&apos;ve found that my mind sees a &quot;C&quot; and wants it to be a &quot;C&quot; in every octave, rather than an F# or whatever it turns out to be in that particular scale (in this case a equal tempered quarter-tone scale) and my mind tries to put things into traditional tunings and messes me up. Trying to get it fine tuned and repeat that tuning again is another matter entirely. As a largely commercial musician, (I sometimes call myself a &quot;prostitute musician&quot;, playing anything that pays), few audiences appreciate other tuning systems, usually, so seldom go there in live performances.</p><p>While I still like to consider other scales, I&apos;ve pretty much kept to traditional 12 tone equal tempered scales being a keyboard oriented player. Now if I was good on a sitar or something that had tunable frets or whatever, then I might be much more encouraged to fiddle with other tunings and scales, something that doesn&apos;t want to force me into 12 tone equal tempered thinking that the &quot;black and whites&quot; tend to do.</p><p>Bonnie *:&gt;</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Join the world&#xFFFD;s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=39236 href="#39236">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2002 7:43:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Mark Gould&quot; &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Does anyone suffer the following ear disturbance:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.

But if I try to play a keyboard that&apos;s anything close<br/>to a half-step down, I&apos;m completely disoriented and start going for<br/>the &quot;wrong&quot; keys.</p><p>So I think after a time you&apos;ll get over it.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=39241 href="#39241">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2002 12:31:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>wallyesterpaulrus wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Mark Gould&quot; &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Does anyone suffer the following ear disturbance:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;  1.
