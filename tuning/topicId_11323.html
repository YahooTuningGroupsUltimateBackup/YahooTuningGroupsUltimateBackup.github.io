What do I do about negative<br/>&gt; &gt; deviations from equal temparment?<br/>&gt; In a practical way, you could add an equal amount of cents to each of the<br/>&gt; cents figures in a tuning so that the lowest &quot;minus&quot; deviation is assigned to<br/>&gt; a &quot;normal&quot; note.  All the other notes are now sharper.</p><p>?????  Just add 100 minus the deviation flat to the next-lower 12TET pitch.</p><p>For example, if you want B to be 5 cents flat of a 12TET B, tune it to Bb + 95<br/>cents.</p></div>
