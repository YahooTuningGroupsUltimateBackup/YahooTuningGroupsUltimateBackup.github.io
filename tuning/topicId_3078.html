Calculations show<br/>smallest possible detuned unison at a given fundamental frequency in Hz. Figure<br/>in seconds is number of seconds for one beat between partials<br/>at the fundamental frequency to occur. Assuming a perfectly<br/>harmonic overtone series such as you&apos;re likely to get with a<br/>simple wavetable oscillator, you&apos;d hear faster beats between<br/>the upper partials. But even so!</p><p>Cycle Length: 128 samples<br/>  1/(86.13806962967 Hz - 86.1328125 Hz) = 190.235 seconds<br/>  1/(689.0677571297 Hz - 689.0625 Hz)   = 190.512 seconds</p><p>Cycle Length: 512 samples<br/>  1/(86.13412678242 Hz - 86.1328125 Hz) = 762.047 seconds<br/>  1/(689.0638142824 Hz - 689.0625 Hz)   = 780.190 seconds</p><p>So the tuning resolution in Hz is seen to be slightly less<br/>for lower frequencies - but the length of a cycle in the wave<br/>table is a major contributor to tuning accuracy. Longer tables<br/>(requiring more memory and suggesting a higher initial sampling<br/>rate when creating the waveform banks) = more accuracy.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
