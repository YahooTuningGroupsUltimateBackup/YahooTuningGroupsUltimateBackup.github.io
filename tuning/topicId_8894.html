Does Lindley (or can you) present any such<br/>&gt; evidence?</p><p>The quick answer would be that Lindley indeed focuses on this<br/>criterion, as likely would anyone playing these pieces and seeking the<br/>best tuning, since a Pythagorean diminished sixth or &quot;Wolf&quot; fifth like<br/>B-Gb is a classic illustration of a nonequivalent for a 3:2 fifth, to<br/>put it mildly.</p><p>Thus in his germinal article &quot;Pythagorean Intonation and the Rise of<br/>the Triad,&quot; _Royal Musical Association Research Chronicle_ 16:4-61<br/>(1980), ISSN 0080-4460, Lindley shows that for the Robertsbridge Codex<br/>(c. 1335?) an F#-B (or actually Gb-B) tuning &quot;is out of the question&quot;<br/>(p. 33) because of the prominent use of the fifth B-F#. He concludes<br/>that a typical 14th-century tuning of Eb-G# would very nicely fit this<br/>collection, a conclusion which might fit most 14th-century pieces.</p><p>In contrast, in suggesting that the Gb-B tuning may have influenced<br/>the vocal compositions of certain composers in the epoch of around<br/>1400, Lindley remarks (p. 43):</p><p>          &quot;Anyone familiar with the secular composition of<br/>           Matteo of Perugia (active 1402-16) will readily<br/>           observe that most them avoid the harmonic interval<br/>           B-F#, especially between the lower voices, but at<br/>           the same time contain prominent written-in sharps<br/>           involving those triads that would have a special<br/>           sound in the F# x B tuning.&quot;</p><p>On p. 44, he offers a suggested list of &quot;other such works&quot; from the<br/>late 14th and early 15th centuries. By the way, rather than using<br/>Lindley&apos;s term &quot;triad&quot;[1], I would prefer to use such terms as _quinta<br/>fissa_ (&quot;split fifth&quot;), for example, to describe an outer fifth<br/>&quot;split&quot; by a middle voice into a major and minor third (e.g. D3-F#3-A3<br/>-- or, in this tuning, D3-Gb3-A3 with near-pure schisma thirds D3-Gb3<br/>and Gb3-A3). Here C4 is middle C, and higher numbers show higher<br/>octaves.</p><p>In practice, of course, the question gets much more complicated,<br/>because while the presence of prominent sonorities involving the fifth<br/>B-F# tends to exclude a 12-note F#-B (i.e. Gb-B) tuning, there are<br/>several other tuning possibilities to consider.</p><p>Also, some of Lindley&apos;s examples suggest to me that different people<br/>can reach different conclusions on how &quot;prominent&quot; a Wolf fifth should<br/>be to motivate one to choose some other tuning.</p><p>First, let&apos;s consider some of the tuning options during the late<br/>medieval and early Renaissance eras:</p><p>A. Traditional Gothic (1300-1420, sometimes later)<br/>   1. A &quot;classic&quot; 12-note Pythagorean tuning, e.g. Eb-G#;<br/>B. Transitional Pythagorean (1380?-1450?)<br/>   2. A 12-note Pythagorean tuning of F#-B (Gb-B);<br/>   3. A 13-note Pythagorean tuning of Gb-B plus a true F# (Gb-F#);<br/>   4. A 15-17 note Pythagorean tuning, e.g. Eb-G# plus Gb-B (Gb-G#);<br/>C. Renaissance meantone (starting around 1450?)<br/>   5. A 12-note meantone tuning (e.g. Eb-G# or Ab-C#);<br/>   6. An extended meantone tuning like Eb-G# plus Ab and D# (Ab-D#).</p><p>In deciding between these alternatives, period and general style -- as<br/>well as the preferences of the interpreter -- are important factors.</p><p>For example, in his article, Lindley gives an excerpt from a keyboard<br/>composition which he regards as appropriate for the Gb-B tuning:<br/>Buxheimer Organ Book #180, _Ob lieb din Lieb_ (Lindley, p. 48,<br/>ex. 25). However, this excerpt itself includes a fifth B-F# with the<br/>duration in transcription of a semiminim (crotchet) or quarter-note,<br/>and at least at my tempo of playing this piece, I definitely prefer to<br/>avoid such a Wolf fifth, although like Lindley I find a Pythagorean<br/>tuning fitting, and agree with him that some prolonged noncadential<br/>sonorities could serve as ideal illustrations of the schisma third<br/>effect (D3-A3-F#4 as D3-A3-Gb4; E3-A3-C#4-E4 as E3-A3-Db4-E4).</p><p>Interestingly, Lindley elsewhere suggests one quite viable alternative<br/>for this piece and others like it: a 13-note tuning with Gb-B plus an<br/>extra key providing a true F#, and thus a concordant fifth B-F#.<br/>Having earlier cited some 15th-century sources mentioning or endorsing<br/>the idea of _two_ accidental keys between F and G, Lindley remarks (at<br/>p. 45):</p><p>          &quot;Were evidence found that keyboard instruments with<br/>           thirteen notes per octave were built prior to the<br/>           late fifteenth century (that is, including two<br/>           forms of F#, as hinted by Ramos&apos;s friend Tristan<br/>           de Silva), then another group of compositions<br/>           would become particularly significant: those<br/>           which exploit the fifth B-F# as well as the<br/>           other intervals containing sharps.&quot;</p><p>Thus while Lindley might consider the fifth B-F# in _Ob lieb din Lieb_<br/>to be transient enough that a Wolf intonation is tolerable in G-Bb,<br/>those of us who prefer to avoid this dissonance might choose a 13-note<br/>Pythagorean tuning. This tuning provides all the schisma thirds and<br/>sixths of Gb-B plus a pure fifth B-F#.</p><p>My own choice, however, is to go with a 15-note Pythagorean tuning of<br/>Gb-G# -- basically a combination of the &quot;classic&quot; 14th-century tuning<br/>Eb-G# with the usual flats and sharps, and the early 15th-century Gb-B<br/>for the schisma thirds. In addition to solving the B-F# Wolf problem,<br/>this kind of tuning gives the option of using near-pure schisma thirds<br/>and sixths for &quot;coloristic&quot; sonorities like E3-A3-C#3/Db4-E4, but<br/>regular Pythagorean thirds and sixths for direction cadential<br/>sonorities like E3-C#4 leading to D3-D4 (M6-8).</p><p>Two theorists of the early 15th century, Prosdocimus of Beldemandis<br/>and Ugolino of Orvieto, express their preference for &quot;full perfected&quot;<br/>major thirds and sixths in M3-5 and M6-8 progressions -- that is, the<br/>regular wide and active Pythagorean flavors of these intervals,<br/>resolving by narrow diatonic semitones. Both these authors describe<br/>and endorse a 17-note Pythagorean tuning (Gb-A#), which Ugolino notes<br/>would permit the &quot;intelligent organist&quot; to perfect such thirds and<br/>sixths with discretion.</p><p>As Lindley (p. 45) remarks, 15th-century musicians may likely have<br/>found the wider cadential semitones entailed by a 12-note Gb-B tuning<br/>as something of a &quot;necessary evil&quot; for the sake of the beguiling<br/>schisma intervals. With a keyboard of 15 or more notes, however, we<br/>can choose freely between &quot;smoothed&quot; sonorities with schisma intervals<br/>(using Gb, Db, Ab for written F#, C#, G#) and dynamic cadential<br/>sonorities with regular Pythagorean thirds and sixths (with true F#,<br/>C#, G#).</p><p>As we reach the mid-15th century, another alternative arises: a<br/>meantone tuning, which solves the B-F# problem while providing smooth<br/>thirds and sixths for all such intervals with regular spellings.</p><p>A complication in all this is that a piece might be conceived in an<br/>era when one kind of tuning was likely in vogue, but also give very<br/>pleasant results for performers and listeners of a somewhat later<br/>epoch when realized in a newer tuning.</p><p>Lindley himself mentions this kind of situation when he notes that<br/>certain 14th-century compositions would take on &quot;an unforeseen<br/>acoustical aura&quot; when performed around 1400 in a Gb-B or similar<br/>tuning transforming thirds and sixths involving sharps into near-pure<br/>schisma intervals (p. 44).</p><p>Another way of putting this is that some compositions of Machaut, for<br/>example, might be satisfyingly realized either in an Eb-G# tuning<br/>(c. 1370?) or a Gb-B tuning (a &quot;modern&quot; interpretation of c. 1410?).<br/>Lindley, commendably, lists some compositions of Machaut as lending<br/>themselves to this treatment while leaving open the question of the<br/>composer&apos;s original intent.</p><p>His suggestion that by around 1400-1410, and a bit earlier in some<br/>Italian centers, the Gb-B may have been influencing such composers as<br/>Matteo de Perugia, Ciconia, and likewise the young Dufay in the<br/>1420&apos;s, seems quite credible and attractive.</p><p>As we enter the epoch around 1450, similarly, we face the possibility<br/>that many pieces originally conceived for Pythagorean keyboards may<br/>have been played on early meantone instruments.</p><p>Anyway, for the late Pythagorean repertory, we have in effect three<br/>possible criteria in choosing between the various tunings:</p><p>     1. Wolf avoidance, specifically B-F# in Gb-B tuning;<br/>     2. Schisma thirds/sixths with Gb, Db, Ab;<br/>     3. Regular cadential thirds/sixths with F#, C#, G#.</p><p>A classic 14th-century tuning of Eb-G# gives us (1) and (3); a 12-note<br/>tuning of Gb-B gives us (2); a 13-note tuning of Gb-B plus a true F#<br/>gives us (1) and (2); a 15-note or larger tuning with F#/Gb, C#/Db,<br/>and G#/Ab gives us all three advantages.</p><p>Maybe my main point in all this is that whatever criteria we decide<br/>on, people applying them to actual music may reach different<br/>conclusions -- is that B-F# sonority &quot;merely passing,&quot; or prominent<br/>enough to make a Wolf fifth in the Gb-B tuning a &quot;contraindication&quot;?</p><p>Anyway, Paul, thank you for a question which not only invites more<br/>discussion of Lindley&apos;s very important article, but shows how taste as<br/>well as logic can play a role in tuning decisions.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. Note, by the way, that I&apos;d prefer to use some term other than<br/>&quot;triad&quot; to describe unstable sonorities around 1400 such as an outer<br/>fifth plus lower and upper third (e.g. D3-F#3-A3) or an outer sixth<br/>plus lower third plus upper fourth, or vice versa (e.g. E3-G#3-C#4 or<br/>G3-C4-E4). Here I use C4 for middle C, and higher numbers for higher<br/>octaves.</p><p>The problem I have with &quot;triad&quot; is that not only is it anachronistic,<br/>it may for many readers imply stability, and distract from the<br/>directed cadential implications of a sonority such as E3-G#3-C#4,<br/>often resolving to a stable D3-A3-D4 (M6-8 + M3-5 by stepwise contrary<br/>motion).</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
