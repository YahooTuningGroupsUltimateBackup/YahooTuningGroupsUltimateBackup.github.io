I think I said it in a post once, and posted a correction<br/>shortly after.  Sorry if I have contributed to a misunderstanding.  This<br/>condition is equivalent to strict propriety.</p><p>&gt;So, equal temperaments would all qualify?</p><p>What qualifies or not is a set of three things- generator, interval of<br/>equivalence (IE), and number of tones.  It is true that all possible<br/>generators in an x root of n tuning have an x-tone MOS when the interval of<br/>equivalence is n, and some generators will also have MOS&apos;s with &lt; x tones,<br/>if x is not prime.</p><p>&gt;Plus a succession of fourths would qualify?  How about a succession of<br/>&gt;variable fourths?</p><p>That depends on what you mean by &quot;fourths&quot;?  In &quot;variable fourths,&quot; Wilson<br/>means intervals that subtend four scale degrees, but may be of different<br/>acoustic sizes.  To be MOS or not, the acoustic size of the generator must<br/>be known; the scalar size of the generator is determined later, by the<br/>number of places the chain is carried out to.</p><p>Remember that not all chains of an interval are MOS- only those chains<br/>where the chained interval (generator) always covers the same number tones<br/>in the IE-reduced scale are MOS.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=4283 href="#4283">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@nni.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/1999 7:05:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote...</p><p>&gt;Joe, may I suggest: &quot;A pythagorean-type scale (the generator need not be the<br/>&gt;3/2, and the interval of equivalence need not be the 2/1) is MOS iff the<br/>&gt;generating interval occurs at only one scale degree in all modes of the<br/>&gt;scale (i.e. 3/2 is always a 5th in the diatonic scale).&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It is true that all possible generators in an x root of n tuning have an<br/>&gt;x-tone MOS when the interval of equivalence is n, and some generators will<br/>&gt;also have MOS&apos;s with &lt; x tones...</p><p>I should point out that this allows cases where the generator evenly<br/>divides the IE (like the augmented triad in 12tET) to be MOS.
