Apparently, some of them might never<br/>have practiced tuning a harpsichord and just wrote down what came<br/>to them by hearsay.</p><p>I&apos;ve listened already Couperin-music performed in &quot;authentic&quot;<br/>Fr.Temp.

Can someone describe the subject temperament in<br/>&gt; terms<br/>&gt; &gt; of the circle of fifths for a 12-tone system?  IOW, starting with<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; note C how is the Pythagorean (ditonic) comma destributed in terms<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; each of the 12 fifths in order to achieve closure?  Thanks for your<br/>&gt; &gt; comment.  Sincerely,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The French Temperament Ordinaire differs from other well-temperaments<br/>&gt; in that it has a few perfect fifths _wider_ than pure -- typically<br/>&gt; the fifth Bb-F and adjacent fifths. Thus the remaining fifths have to<br/>&gt; be narrowed by a total of more than one pythagorean comma. Generally<br/>&gt; this means that all keys from F major through A major will be very<br/>&gt; pure and meantone-like.</p><p>That&apos;s fine! But how are the keys of C#, F#- and Ab - major??<br/>Manuel may have some specific examples.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
