I&apos;ve known others who<br/>_thought_ they were producing 4:5:6:7 dominant seventh chords, but<br/>were in fact rather far from it . . . also cases where 10:12:15 minor<br/>triads, and various supposed half-diminished tunings, were thought to<br/>have been being used, but weren&apos;t.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi, John!
