I&apos;m not sure what to call the list.</p><p>So (building on something Dan was speaking about) a description might go<br/>:</p><p>&quot;Guitarists with a cultivated microtonal approach without the benefit of<br/>a<br/> microtonal instrument proper, or study of microtonality, per se.<br/> These musicians regularily use pitches that fall outside the ubiquitous<br/> &quot;standard&quot; of 12-TET (Tone Equal Temperament), or more precisely,<br/> 12-EDO (Equal Divisions of the Octave).&quot;</p><p>So, this list might include guitarists like Ken Rubenstein, Glen Phillips,<br/>Hans Reichel, Dave Tronzo, Missisipi Fred McDowell, Steve Vai,<br/>Jimi Hendrix, Cedell Davis, etc.</p><p>Any comments/suggestions/additions to such a list ?</p><p>This is turning out to be a somewhat larger undertaking than I thought.<br/>But it&apos;s coming along nicely ! The site will have no unnecessary grahics,<br/>just the facts, and some photos of guitars &amp; guitarists.</p><p>Please keep the info coming. Anything you have to say/add, say it.<br/>E-mail me privately if you like.</p><p>Ciao,<br/>Drew</p></div>
