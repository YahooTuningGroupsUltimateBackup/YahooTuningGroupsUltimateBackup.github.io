But in this case, I<br/>found that the Dm/F ends up working well as 16:20:27, which in this<br/>situation sounds bright and unresolved and great. After getting used to this<br/>sound, I went back to meantone in which that 20:27 becomes a very, very<br/>resonant 4:3, which threw me for a loop entirely. Hence I had, to myself at<br/>least, &quot;identified&quot; the characteristic sound of the syntonic pun.</p><p>And in truth, I did get it, or at least I have it figured out in a way that<br/>makes sense to me. But the issue of the placebo effect aside, how could I<br/>ever know if this is because I had just formed a new map, or if the map was<br/>always there in the form of JI and I had to rediscover it? And then it gets<br/>philosophically absurd when you start to get into &quot;Is there a difference? Is<br/>it just semantics here?&quot; etc.</p><p>So tuning theory makes for some good zen koans.

Do they have a major/minor quality? Maybe reply offlist<br/>&gt; or on tuning.<br/>The 7-limit otonal tetrad sounds like a dominant 7 chord, the utonal tetrad<br/>sounds like a m6 chord, and the utonal tetrad in 1/4:1/5:1/6:1/7 inversion<br/>sounds like a half diminished 7 chord. Most interesting to me here is the<br/>parallel between the utonal tetrad in the &quot;m6&quot; inversion, and a subminor 6<br/>chord 6:7:9:10, can sound so similar. But in the second case, unless you&apos;re<br/>playing a 3 and a 1.5 in the bass, the 1 fundamental can become so loud that<br/>it just starts sounding like effectively a fifth note, so the whole thing<br/>starts to sound like a dom9 chord with the upper partials being emphasized.</p><p>&gt; &gt;For the minor triad I&apos;m even less sure that 10:12:15 serves an<br/>&gt; &gt;archetypical function. I did a test on this the other day and heard<br/>&gt; &gt;the 10:12:15 as having a fundamental of &quot;5&quot;, and the 6:7:9 as having a<br/>&gt; &gt;fundamental of &quot;1&quot; (or maybe it was 2 or 4, either way it was<br/>&gt; &gt;definitely a chroma a fourth off from the other one).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Were 10: and 6: the same pitch or...? For me, the lowest note<br/>&gt; in both chords can clearly be the fundamental, due to the outside<br/>&gt; fifth (2:3). Unless, in the case of 6:7:9, I&apos;m primed with<br/>&gt; 4:6:7:9 (or similar) beforehand.<br/>No, they were different. I did the test differently this time, using an idea<br/>I had to get past any type of &quot;mapping bias&quot;: I made a MIDI file of the<br/>melody to Yankee Doodle in C major. I sent it through a 3-op virtual analog<br/>synth. I set the 3 oscillators to 4:5:6, set about 2 octaves above middle C.<br/>As you&apos;d expect, it played in C major.</p><p>I then set them to 10:12:15, and they played in the key of C an octave up,<br/>and the timbre sounded like it had an extra bell-like inharmonic component<br/>to it. So at that point I realized why everyone came to the realization that<br/>the C-G dyad is what&apos;s emphasized, and the Eb is thrown away. But, if I<br/>tried, I could &quot;refocus&quot; on another fundamental appearing all the way down<br/>at Ab somewhere, I wasn&apos;t sure if this was 2 or 1. I didn&apos;t really look for<br/>Eb although I probably should have. This might have also been due to the<br/>presence of some kind of nonlinear distortion too.</p><p>I then set it to 6:7:9, and Yankee Doodle played in F, which was pretty<br/>awesome at the time. I was going to test 16:19:24 and answer The Ultimate<br/>Question Of Minorness, and then SONAR crashed and I lost everything, and I<br/>gave up. I&apos;ll do it again though.</p><p>One interesting thing, though, was at one point I heard a messed up<br/>distorted F popping out of it, and I realized I was perceiving 10:12:15 as a<br/>detuned 6:7:9. It was really fragile and lasted for only a short while, and<br/>then went back to being C again.</p><p>&gt; 4:5:6 seems to have a wider field of attraction than either 6:7:9<br/>&gt; or 10:12:15.<br/>I did consider that as an explanation - that I&apos;m just hearing the supermajor<br/>triad as a detuned 4:5:6. I also considered that this might &quot;bias&quot; me to<br/>hearing the minor triad as a 10:12:15, since the 4:5 would become the top of<br/>a 10:12:15.</p><p>I&apos;m still open to that interpretation, but I have a few reasons that I&apos;m not<br/>sure if that&apos;s what it is:</p><p>1) Where does it stop? Would that mean that all musical perception DOES<br/>directly derive from JI, if you have intervals influencing the perception of<br/>intervals influencing the perception of intervals and so on? Occam&apos;s Razor<br/>says no, but it&apos;s still possible.</p><p>2) Especially after playing with mavila[5], I think that when we hear a 5/4,<br/>a number of things happen that we all lump together under the &quot;major third&quot;<br/>umbrella. Part of it has to do with cultural/diatonic stuff, and another<br/>part of it has to do with how it is rooted and concordant, and we just lump<br/>them together in with the &quot;major third&quot; name.</p><p>3) After playing with mavila[5] I got to separate some of these things a<br/>bit, and end up in the aural situation where the first major third quality<br/>was assigned to 6/5, and the last was not. This happened mainly when playing<br/>stacked-fifth (or even better, octave-reduced stack fifth stuff), which<br/>&quot;flipped my brain&quot; to hear that 6/5 as very much a major third. Is this<br/>because I&apos;m &quot;hearing&quot; 81/64, which I also call a &quot;major third?&quot; Or cultural<br/>diatonic stuff that has nothing to do with JI? I wish I knew... :)</p><p>4) If you play a 6/5 minor third, say C-Eb, note how easy it is to imagine<br/>the root as C; that is, imagine it as being part of a Cm triad instead of<br/>Abmaj. Of course, the fundamental being produced is still going to be Ab and<br/>noticeably so, but in a musical context it is very easy to just ignore that<br/>Ab as extra &quot;noise&quot; and imagine the root as C.</p><p>When I play a 14:18:21 triad, with a timbre with a weaker 5th partial, it<br/>sounds unsettlingly unrooted compared to 4:5:6. I find that I can get used<br/>to it, but it just takes on a different &quot;flavor&quot; than the major triad - it<br/>still has the &quot;function&quot; of a major triad in diatonic harmony, but is<br/>nowhere near as resonant and rooted. It&apos;s almost like a minor triad in that<br/>I feel like the direct super-resonance of 4:5:6 is gone, and you just have<br/>the resonance of the perfect fifth with this foreign interval in between,<br/>which for some inexplicable reason made me hear it as almost sad. I actually<br/>got a full-blown synesthetic experience out of it - it was still &quot;major,&quot;<br/>but reminded me of the feeling of being &quot;chilly,&quot; as if it was the end of<br/>summer and turning to autumn, and so on.</p><p>The above are really just my subjective experiences. Perhaps the sensible<br/>thing to be done is to do another listening test with 14:18:21, and see what<br/>comes out. (I also want to do one in which different triads are put in front<br/>of 10:12:15, and see if you can &quot;prime&quot; it so that different fundamentals<br/>pop out each time from the same chord.)</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92713 href="#92713">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2010 2:50:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike:</p><p>&gt; &gt; 7-ET is actually a very good 5-limit temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the 3-limit I could see this, but why do you say for the<br/>&gt; 5-limit?

I suspect that this is because too many unique notes (i.e. not octave-doublings) sort of &quot;overload&quot; the perceptive faculties of most listeners, and when you get much more complex than triads, you&apos;re already pushing the limit.  I mean, changing one note in a triad creates a world of difference, but changing one note in a pentad or a hexad and you&apos;re lucky if the change is noticeable unless it&apos;s a huge change!  The overall effect of having a bad dyad in a chord can be &quot;drowned out&quot; by other good dyads, and the &quot;roughness&quot; added by that bad dyad may actually be pleasant (since modern humans don&apos;t seem to mind a bit of roughness, especially as a contrast to purity).</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=92719 href="#92719">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2010 1:02:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs&gt;&quot;I mean, changing one note in a triad creates a world of difference,  but<br/>changing one note in a pentad or a hexad and you&apos;re lucky if the  change is<br/>noticeable unless it&apos;s a huge change!&quot;<br/>  Exactly!

And there are two other inversions...</p><p>OK, let&apos;s call the &quot;m6&quot; variant root position. So first inversion is<br/>something like C E F# A, and sounds like it could either be a m6 chord<br/>in first inversion or the upper partials to a D9. Second inversion is<br/>something like C D F Ab, and sounds like it could either be a m6 chord<br/>in second inversion or the upper partials to a Bb9. Third inversion is<br/>something like C Eb Gb Bb and sounds like a half-dim7 chord. At least<br/>that was my impression of all of them.</p><p>Doing this experiment with the subminor equivalent of this chord, or<br/>6:7:9:10, yielded pretty much the same results but sounded much more<br/>resonant and concordant, as you&apos;d probably expect. The louder<br/>fundamental, however, biased me to hear everything as upper partials<br/>to dom9 chords.</p><p>&gt; 9:7 reminds me of the case we were just talking about with the<br/>&gt; 720-cent fifth, which was far away from 3:2 but still in 3:2&apos;s<br/>&gt; field of attraction -- and that&apos;s partly why it sounds so bad.</p><p>Right, but a few things come to mind with that:</p><p>1) The #1 thing that makes 720 cents to me sound so bad is the beating<br/>between the partials of the two notes. If you play it with a pure<br/>tone, or pick a clever timbre to hide this (like use a triangle wave<br/>so there&apos;s no 2 to beat against the 3), it sounds much, much better.<br/>2) Even if you use sine waves, it sounds really sharp, but I think<br/>part of this may be due to me starting to hear it move into &quot;minor<br/>6th&quot; territory. Cultural biases make this hard to pinpoint. All I know<br/>is, while I typed this entire message I had a triangle-ish recorder<br/>patch playing 3\5, and now that it&apos;s been like 5 minutes with that<br/>drone I hear it as a decent fifth.<br/>3) However, even assuming that this is entirely an issue of<br/>periodicity, I used to think the same about the 686 7-tet fifth. And<br/>after hearing knowsur&apos;s album, I think you could probably use 720<br/>cents to sound harmonically pleasant as well, if you&apos;re deft enough at<br/>constructing the proper musical context for it as knowsur did.</p><p>&gt; Same with 9:7. Still in 5:4&apos;s basin of attraction. Unlike<br/>&gt; 720 cents, it can be beatless. Still sounds bad on its own,<br/>&gt; though it sounds fantastic in 4:5:7:9. So clearly the<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic identity (in terms of JI) of intervals and<br/>&gt; chords is important.</p><p>The points I raised with #1 and #2 apply here. But to get some more<br/>useful data, I ran the timbral listening test again, with a just<br/>supermajor triad as the timbre, with the 3 oscillators tuned to sines.<br/>And instead of Yankee Doodle, I did a Mozart piece in C.</p><p>What is interesting, as a precursor to this, is that I ran the minor<br/>triad first. The minor triad is set up to be a masterpiece of priming.<br/>If we&apos;re talking C Eb G, you can make yourself hear the fundamental as<br/>C (the obvious choice), as Ab (start with the C Eb and gradually bring<br/>up the volume of the G, focusing on the Ab the whole time), as Eb<br/>(start with Eb and G, and bring up the C gradually; I found this one<br/>harder than Ab for some reason), and even as an Ab an octave below the<br/>other Ab, which indicates placement of the full 10:12:15 triad (I<br/>think this one might have been due to speaker distortion though). At<br/>one point, I got an isolated C-Eb dyad to sound like 5:4 (i.e. a C was<br/>popping out in a lower octave), then I heard the fundamental as Ab and<br/>now it&apos;s hard to snap back. Sometimes you can hear more than one<br/>fundamental at once. The whole tonal mass, if you focus on it, if a<br/>complex polytonal object where different fundamental come in and out<br/>of existence, sometimes more than one existing simultaneously, and<br/>with the 3:2 dyad on the outside being the strongest. Keep in mind<br/>that the notes themselves are also fundamentals.</p><p>So I set out to see how 14:18:21 fares. Right away, I heard the piece<br/>play in C 2 octaves down, thus indicating that it was being heard as<br/>4:5:6, but the presence of some crazy extraneous bell-like overtone<br/>was also present. I then tried for just 7:9 and it was still in C. I<br/>then tried just the 18:21 (which is a 7:6), and should have heard it<br/>in A, but instead the whole thing was completely ambiguous and I only<br/>could hear &quot;hints&quot; of it being in A, which popped out at random, and I<br/>wasn&apos;t sure quite what I was hearing at first. Putting 6:7:8 in made<br/>the &quot;A&quot; pop out, though. I was surprised that 7:6 was such a weak<br/>concordance. 7:9 was completely impossible, and was heard as 5:4.</p><p>However, there were moments when I heard the supermajor triad in the<br/>same way I heard the minor one: with the octave above popping out, and<br/>hearing just a random inharmonic tone in the middle. So that is also<br/>in line with my earlier perception of the supermajor triad: usually,<br/>it just sounds like an out of tune major triad, but there are brief<br/>moments where it sounds different, similar to the minor chord in that<br/>it&apos;s a sonority that doesn&apos;t sound &quot;fully rooted,&quot; which is probably<br/>what gave me the synesthetic reaction I had. Moments where my musical<br/>perception was like that were rare, as were moments where my timbral<br/>perception was like that also rare.</p><p>Thus ends my situation report, and now I really feel like I know nothing.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92724 href="#92724">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2010 10:48:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Sep 14, 2010 at 12:59 AM, cameron &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, I should add that I sometimes find a kind of &quot;minor&quot; quality to a 9:7. 5/4 my butt.</p><p>As you have expressed that you are synesthetic, you will note that in<br/>my earlier post I had a similar reaction - it&apos;s a less rooted triad<br/>with a note in the middle that isn&apos;t 5/4, just like minor.

Yes, it sounds minor, although perhaps if I<br/>&gt; was the proud owner of a map in which those two were distinguished,<br/>&gt; maybe it wouldn&apos;t. As you can see, I am clearly having trouble<br/>&gt; distinguishing musical meaning from psychoacoustics at this point.</p><p>Describing intervals as &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; is, I think, a red herring.  And perhaps a false dichotomy.  The terms themselves basically mean nothing more than &quot;wide&quot; and &quot;narrow&quot; or &quot;large&quot; and &quot;small&quot;.  So of course, when you play diatonic music where there are two types of third, one&apos;s going to big and the other small, and these sizes will be relative to each other; thus asking if a chord sounds &quot;major&quot; or &quot;minor&quot; is simply asking &quot;does this chord sound like it has a relatively-small or relatively-large third in it?&quot;</p><p>I don&apos;t think this is *really* what you guys are trying to figure out.  You&apos;re using &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; to refer to the musico-semantic *content* typically associated with major and minor chords, effectively trying to ask &quot;can two chords with different JI templates carry the same musico-semantic content?&quot;  Or, in other words, &quot;is it possible to associate multiple audibly-distinct psychoacoustic phenomena with the same perceptual gestalt?&quot;</p><p>To this, all I can say is: doing &quot;deep listening&quot; on a single dyad, I am perfectly capable of extracting (or perhaps projecting) any number of meanings from (or onto) ANY one dyad.

But what I really mean is that I can get it to cause the same change in cognitive state associated with any of those other intervals.  This is because music, just like words, loses its semantic definitiveness under close scrutiny.  Doing &quot;deep listening&quot; is the musical equivalent of repeating a single word over and over again.  If you&apos;ve never done that, try it: say &quot;door&quot; over and over again to yourself and pay attention to how the word&apos;s meaning changes.  Its meaning sort of unravels, or is eclipsed by the phonetic qualities (or something).</p><p>My point is thus: listening to different chords over and over again under close scrutiny reveals nothing about their musico-semantic content.  If you really want to know how if 7/6 really differs from 6/5, or if 9/7 really differs from 5/4, concoct a few diatonic-esque scales where the two thirds are ONLY 7/6 and 6/5, or ONLY 5/4 and 9/7.  Then see if you can tell the difference when playing chord progressions.  HINT: you may need to go non-octave to get these scales to work.  Perhaps this will reveal that 5/4 can sound &quot;minor&quot;, or that 6/5 can sound &quot;major&quot;?  Either way, comparing superpyth with meantone won&apos;t help, because in any given instance, you&apos;re not comparing 7/6 and 6/5 relative to each other, or 9/7 and 5/4 relative to each other; you&apos;re comparing 7/6 relative to 9/7, and 6/5 relative to 5/4.

Of course, I suppose if I called it &quot;A-C-E#&quot;, I could have won the argument, but this was before I knew that &quot;enharmonic equivalence&quot; didn&apos;t just mean &quot;musical synonym&quot;.</p><p>But I digress.  If I play a drone, say &quot;A&quot;, and then play various notes above it--say a 6/5, a 5/4, a 9/7, a 4/3, and a 3/2, I really don&apos;t know how to hear different &quot;fundamentals&quot; as the dyad changes.  I hear &quot;A&quot; as the root, usually because, being a drone, I&apos;m primed to think of it as the root.  It&apos;s the same reason that &quot;modes&quot; are a legitimate way of thinking about music.  Just because C Major and F Lydian share the same notes, it doesn&apos;t mean that C is always the tonic--we can tonicize any note in the scale, really.  If this didn&apos;t work, then we could never resolve to F with the Lydian scale.</p><p>I guess where I&apos;m going with this is that the psychoacoustic &quot;fundamental&quot; is a much weaker phenomenon than you think.  I mean, I might hear a shift in the difference tones between 6:7:9 and 10:12:15, but I swear I don&apos;t hear either of them as having a &quot;missing fundamental&quot; that the difference tones fill in or whatever.  If you build them both on &quot;A&quot;, I hear them both as having &quot;A&quot; as the root.</p><p>&gt; Can you listen to that supermajor example? :)</p><p>So, what exactly are you trying to demonstrate with this example?  That a 9/7 does substitute for 5/4 with no alteration of musico-semantic content?  It does feel a little different.  But I&apos;m pretty sure if you subbed 4/3 for 9/7, it wouldn&apos;t be like &quot;oh my god it&apos;s a completely different WORLD!!!!&quot;.  Sus4 chords have always felt like just &quot;exaggerated major&quot; chords to me.</p><p>&gt; Yes, you are saying to construct a scale in which they serve different<br/>&gt; functions. And if you create a scale where they serve the same function, or<br/>&gt; compare a just major scale with a just supermajor one, or meantone with<br/>&gt; superpyth, they will sound &quot;the same.&quot; It is certainly possible to create a<br/>&gt; map in which 7/6 and 6/5 are distinguished and then draw a difference in<br/>&gt; musical quality between them by referring to that map. You could probably<br/>&gt; create a pseudo-map in which they&apos;re distinguished by just playing 6/5 and<br/>&gt; 7/6 over and over. But that is not the same as saying that sonic quality<br/>&gt; derives only from the fundamental, as you can also create a map in which<br/>&gt; they are interchangeable (i.e. superpyth aeolian vs meantone), and so will<br/>&gt; they sound &quot;the same.&quot;</p><p>Well, I still think you need to try my suggestion--WILL they sound distinct if the map distinguishes them?  What if we concoct a map based on 5:6:7 triads and their utonal inversions (30:35:42), i.e. a hypothetical tonality where 5:7 takes the place of 2:3, 5:6 takes over for 4:5, and 6:7 takes over for 5:6?  Such a map will clearly distinguish 5:6 from 6:7, but will we hear 5:6:7 as any more &quot;major&quot; than 30:35:42?</p><p>Hmm...I think I can more or less do this in 18-EDO, maybe *I* should try it?  18-EDO is, I believe, the lowest EDO that distinguishes 6/5 and 7/6, and its error is no worse than 12-tET in this regard.</p><p>Although, I think contrasting major and supermajor might be more illuminating...but I don&apos;t know what kind of scale you could use to do it.  Using 4:5 and 7:9 to make chords leads to 28:35:45 and 28:36:45--not exactly a huge difference, and it&apos;d be tough to say which one is otonal and which one is utonal, since they&apos;re so close in the harmonic series!  In fact, I&apos;d be surprised if I could tell the difference between them.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>P.S. did you read my reply at MMM?</p></div><h3><a id=92756 href="#92756">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2010 12:15:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Sep 14, 2010 at 3:05 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would like to hear your thoughts on the other example, since I feel it was<br/>&gt; &gt; more effective at accomplishing what I was going for.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, the supermajor version sounds pretty normal to me.

I have typed it really quite a few times now. At<br/>this point I don&apos;t know what you want. I actually took the time not<br/>only to make the examples, but to make a score for each one, and<br/>asking you to confirm or deny if you hear the examples as written in<br/>the score.</p><p>This is absurd: I spent all of that time writing a score, rendering<br/>mp3&apos;s and uploading pdf&apos;s and so on, telling you exactly what to<br/>listen for, and you&apos;re trying to frame it like these are just random<br/>unmusical examples that I&apos;m throwing out of left field? What the hell<br/>are you trying to do? Get a rise out of me?</p><p>&gt; and why</p><p>Because in each instance, I have hidden various intervals in ways that<br/>you wouldn&apos;t expect, making them sound much different than you&apos;re used<br/>to. However, the scales are all improper, which means that they&apos;re<br/>unstable, and so the perception is such that it can &quot;flip flop&quot;<br/>between the regular diatonic meaning for that interval and the altered<br/>one. I didn&apos;t tell you which is which because I don&apos;t want to<br/>introduce any bias into the equation. So I simply asked if you heard<br/>it like it&apos;s written in the score.</p><p>The question is whether the flip flopping comes from scale<br/>impropriety, or from the fundamental reverting to some more &quot;basic&quot;<br/>&quot;meaning.&apos; An example in which JI intervals are being substituted with<br/>other ones and there is no impropriety would basically answer this<br/>question - if the chords in the scale sound unrecognizably different,<br/>then it comes down to periodicity stuff, if they sound the same, then<br/>it comes down to mapping. At the very least, a scale which is only<br/>&quot;slightly&quot; improper, or where the impropriety is hidden in intervals<br/>that aren&apos;t often played, or where the impropriety is such that<br/>cognitively it&apos;s still &quot;mostly proper,&quot; would suffice.</p><p>I know of one such scale in which this is the case, and it&apos;s the<br/>superpyth aeolian vs the meantone aeolian example, and it behaves as I<br/>would expect.</p><p>&gt; and even if you did, they sound so funky I don&apos;t think I&apos;d hear it.</p><p>I got in a discussion with my friends a while ago about high-energy<br/>physics. I told them that if you had a nuclear bomb, and you put it in<br/>a giant thermodynamically sealed box that was impervious to<br/>destruction, put it on a giant scale, and then detonated the bomb, the<br/>weight of the box wouldn&apos;t go down. I then said that if you opened up<br/>a windowpane in the box that simply allows light to leave, the weight<br/>of the box would go down.</p><p>They thought that it was a &quot;silly example,&quot; because it was just<br/>completely impractical and unrealistic. I said that if we&apos;re going to<br/>be talking about theoretical physics at all, then we&apos;re going to be<br/>dealing with &quot;impractical&quot; examples that push the limits of reality,<br/>and to criticize my example on that grounds is absurd.</p><p>If we&apos;re going to be dealing with the fundamentals of musical<br/>perception, we&apos;re going to be dealing with examples that push the<br/>limits of musical perception, so to criticize them on the grounds that<br/>they&apos;re &quot;unmusical&quot; or &quot;unpleasant&quot; is likewise absurd. They&apos;re<br/>supposed to sound like distorted diatonic melodies, because to figure<br/>out how this works, the approach I&apos;m taking is to distort them until<br/>something breaks, and find out where and how.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92815 href="#92815">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2010 12:03:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; There is supposed to be sustain.

The fact that a bare<br/>minor third still sounds minor, whether it&apos;s anywhere between 7/6 to<br/>somewhere less than a neutral third, however, confounds that. It can<br/>even sound rooted if you want it to, especially if we&apos;re in 12-tet.</p><p>4) For the former to be true in light of the above, this would mean<br/>that the reason a bare minor third sounds &quot;minor&quot; is because we<br/>subconsciously &quot;imagine&quot; other notes there (perhaps the fifth), thus<br/>priming the auditory system to hear the shadow of full minor triad.<br/>The rootedness is still not explainable as far as I can see - if you<br/>assume it&apos;s because we&apos;re viewing the minor third as 19/16, then you<br/>don&apos;t have a &quot;low tonalness&quot; triad anymore.</p><p>5) This is the same assumption as just that we&apos;re conditioned to hear<br/>how a minor third could fit in with other diatonic notes and that<br/>minorness arises from that, so Occam&apos;s razor no longer suggests the<br/>former. If it is so that we can spontaneously imagine the fifth and<br/>have that weighted into the periodicity calculation, then there is no<br/>reason that we couldn&apos;t spontaneously imagine other &quot;key notes&quot; of the<br/>diatonic scale as well.</p><p>6) The point of the mavila example was not whether the last chord<br/>seems major at first sight, but whether you CAN make it sound like a<br/>&quot;really flat major&quot; if you try.

But the only way I can even half-imagine how to test them is if we miraculously got access to a large number of people from cultures where diatonic music is unheard.  Whatever quality we assign to &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; thirds--or triads--that we can say is &quot;characteristic&quot; of those intervals/chords, the only way to know if it comes from cultural bias (i.e. our diatonic maps) is to see if those qualities are assigned to the same intervals by people without our maps.</p><p>However, my guess about why different intervals can share the same &quot;musical quality&quot; for us is that it&apos;s the same thing that happens when people try to understand an unfamiliar language.  Have you ever seen that old flash video &quot;Hyakugojyuuichi&quot;?  It&apos;s a music video for a song with Japanese lyrics, except that the Japanese has been &quot;interpreted&quot; as being heavily-accented English in the sub-titles, giving English lyrics that are completely absurd but sound reasonably like the Japanese words in the song.</p><p>Simply put, our brains love patterns and will do anything to fit sensory input into some established pattern.  If the incoming sensory information can even REMOTELY fit a familiar pattern, our brains will &quot;jam it in there&quot;.  Psychologists have long known that this desire to fit sensory input into familiar patterns can actually cause forms of blindness--so-called &quot;change blindness.&quot;  For instance, a STOP sign where the P is replaced with an F can actually go totally unnoticed.  Of course, there is a threshold for change-blindness; replace the P with a Q, or the T with an N (or something) and people will notice immediately.  But F is close enough to P that the mind can ignore the difference.</p><p>What you have been noticing--that neutral intervals &quot;flip-flop&quot;, that major thirds can sound minor if we&apos;re primed to accept &quot;supermajor thirds&quot; as major thirds, that superpyth and meantone scales can function equally-well for diatonic music--all this points strongly to your brain doing its best to cram unfamiliar intervals into a familiar template.  What exactly the &quot;nature&quot; of this template is, I&apos;m not sure, and I don&apos;t know if it can be successfully investigated by any of us since we&apos;re not (to my knowledge) psychologists.  But of course, one of the reasons that what you&apos;ve noticed about all these intervals may not be agreed upon by everyone on this list could be because they have different &quot;templates&quot;.

Why is this the &quot;real question&quot; to me?  Because the limits of what can be perceived as major/minor are the limits of possible tonal bases (basises?) for musical systems.

How about a bare 6:5 dyad?<br/>&gt; A bare 7:6? Or how about something like G#-F#-b#, a m7 chord without<br/>&gt; the 5? I would be hardpressed to believe that G# will ever pop up as<br/>&gt; the fundamental to that specific grouping of notes, but to me they<br/>&gt; still capture the &quot;essence&quot; of &quot;minorness&quot; from a musical standpoint<br/>&gt; more than just polytonal un-rough chords do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, it occurred to me that if I did an advanced search for<br/>&gt; &quot;harmonic entropy continuing&quot; in the title, I&apos;d get the whole thread.<br/>&gt; So I just did manage to read it, and I found it an interesting read.<br/>&gt; It left me with quite a few thoughts though:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) The sound of a minor triad still to me sounds to be minor, even<br/>&gt; outside of the context of a diatonic scale; I agree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) This could also be because of some inherent psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; implication of the minor triad, or because we start to immediately<br/>&gt; imagine it as part of a diatonic scale, or at least start to imagine a<br/>&gt; &quot;significant subset&quot; of the diatonic scale sufficient enough to<br/>&gt; impress upon us the quality of minorness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) Initially, Occam&apos;s razor suggests the former. The fact that a bare<br/>&gt; minor third still sounds minor, whether it&apos;s anywhere between 7/6 to<br/>&gt; somewhere less than a neutral third, however, confounds that. It can<br/>&gt; even sound rooted if you want it to, especially if we&apos;re in 12-tet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4) For the former to be true in light of the above, this would mean<br/>&gt; that the reason a bare minor third sounds &quot;minor&quot; is because we<br/>&gt; subconsciously &quot;imagine&quot; other notes there (perhaps the fifth), thus<br/>&gt; priming the auditory system to hear the shadow of full minor triad.<br/>&gt; The rootedness is still not explainable as far as I can see - if you<br/>&gt; assume it&apos;s because we&apos;re viewing the minor third as 19/16, then you<br/>&gt; don&apos;t have a &quot;low tonalness&quot; triad anymore.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5) This is the same assumption as just that we&apos;re conditioned to hear<br/>&gt; how a minor third could fit in with other diatonic notes and that<br/>&gt; minorness arises from that, so Occam&apos;s razor no longer suggests the<br/>&gt; former. If it is so that we can spontaneously imagine the fifth and<br/>&gt; have that weighted into the periodicity calculation, then there is no<br/>&gt; reason that we couldn&apos;t spontaneously imagine other &quot;key notes&quot; of the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6) The point of the mavila example was not whether the last chord<br/>&gt; seems major at first sight, but whether you CAN make it sound like a<br/>&gt; &quot;really flat major&quot; if you try. If you can&apos;t, mess around with<br/>&gt; mavila[5] (NOT mavila[7]) for a while and I guarantee you will find<br/>&gt; yourself in the situation more than once where major thirds sound<br/>&gt; minor and minor thirds sound major. It is transient, but it happens. I<br/>&gt; will assume that you have experienced this phenomenon at some point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7) To perceive a minor third as sounding like a &quot;flat major third&quot;, or<br/>&gt; to perceive a major third as sounding like a &quot;sharp minor third,&quot; or a<br/>&gt; &quot;sharp augmented second&quot; (which has a sonority all its own, it&apos;s not<br/>&gt; just an altered second) means that one of two things are happening<br/>&gt; that require an equal amount of assumptions: one is that you are<br/>&gt; actually managing to squeeze the wrong fundamental out of a dyad due<br/>&gt; to insane amounts of priming, which leads to the different meaning.<br/>&gt; The other is that you are managing to push an interval into a mental<br/>&gt; mapping position in which it usually doesn&apos;t go, which leads to the<br/>&gt; different meaning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 8) The distinction between the two might be illusory.

That&apos;s<br/>&gt; pretty basic but I guess I have to spell it out.</p><p>I thought I was doing that. You said there&apos;s no way anyone would ever<br/>hear 6/5 as sounding &quot;major.&quot; I came up with a musical example in<br/>mavila that I thought sounds major at the end despite the 6/5 being<br/>there, and I wanted you to tell me if you heard majorness it. I didn&apos;t<br/>want to tell you the tuning because the perception is quite fragile,<br/>and I thought if you knew to expect it being tuned to 6/5, it would<br/>introduce bias into the experiment. It is, of course, quite easy to<br/>hear it as being minor as well, which isn&apos;t the point; the point is<br/>that it can be heard as a very flat major too. This flexibility of<br/>perception makes the example particularly susceptible to bias.</p><p>After first attacking the example as unmusical and saying it was<br/>irrelevant, you proceeded to say you listened to it and didn&apos;t answer<br/>the question of whether you heard it the way I described. After asking<br/>for you to listen again and reiterating how I heard it, you said that<br/>you heard it pretty much the same way. I then used it to illustrate my<br/>point that 6/5 can be heard as major given the right context and<br/>distorting of the diatonic (or in this case pentatonic) map.</p><p>So where exactly did our communication go wrong? Perhaps you missed my<br/>initial message in which I described what I was asking for you to<br/>listen to? Apparently not, since you quoted it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; They both sounded &quot;diminished.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let me just tell you what I think&apos;s going on here and<br/>&gt; maybe it&apos;ll save us a lot of trouble. Far from emancipating<br/>&gt; the structure of music, you are in fact doing the opposite --<br/>&gt; interpreting xenharmonic chords and scales in terms of<br/>&gt; Western common practice.</p><p>I tried to use the terminology that you were using from the original<br/>thread. You said that major chords sound happy and minor chords sound<br/>sad, and that this was because major chords are otonal and minor<br/>chords are less tonal and not rough. You used the ASS&apos;s to illustrate<br/>your point that the perception of sadness comes right out of the &quot;less<br/>tonal and not rough&quot; quality, and hence that otonality leads to<br/>happiness, and stable chords of low tonalness and low roughness lead<br/>to sadness. At least that&apos;s what I took you to mean.</p><p>When I listened to Igs&apos; example, I didn&apos;t hear &quot;happy, happy, sad,<br/>sad, happy, happy, sad, sad.&quot; I heard &quot;really sad and ambiguous,<br/>really sad and ambiguous, really sad and ambiguous&quot; - which is what<br/>diminishedness sounds like to me. After enough listens I finally heard<br/>a weak fundamental popping out for some of them, and a different<br/>fundamental popping out for the others.</p><p>Perhaps if I listen enough to it, I will hear it as &quot;happy, happy,<br/>sad, sad.&quot; But why does that not mean that happiness and sadness have<br/>something to do with internal cognitive templates, and I haven&apos;t<br/>developed the ones for this example yet?</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s something you&apos;re doing that&apos;s<br/>&gt; interfering with your understanding of xenharmonic music,<br/>&gt; not something everyone else is doing that governs their<br/>&gt; understanding of it. I base this on your comments when<br/>&gt; listening to stuff... you are always using 12-ET pitch<br/>&gt; classes, common practice chord names, etc. to describe<br/>&gt; what you hear. Probably this is because your ear is better<br/>&gt; trained for conventional music than most others here, and/or<br/>&gt; you have less experience listening to xenharmonic stuff.</p><p>Let&apos;s not forget that the way you and I perceive music is, also, very<br/>different. I have AP, which leads to an entirely different level of<br/>cognitive processing than most people have, and biases things in<br/>different ways.</p><p>I think that once I hear a piece of music that sets up a cohesive<br/>cognitive structure for xenharmonic music, I will instantly hear<br/>different shades of happiness and sadness in a way I don&apos;t now.<br/>Knowsur&apos;s album was one of the first to really nail that, and I heard<br/>neutral triads as musically consonant for the first time, and it was a<br/>pivotal moment in my understanding of music.

Maybe.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 1) The sound of a minor triad still to me sounds to be minor,<br/>&gt; &gt; even outside of the context of a diatonic scale; I agree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whew!</p><p>Haha, well I hope you don&apos;t think I was ever saying otherwise!</p><p>&gt; &gt; 2) This could also be because of some inherent psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; &gt; implication of the minor triad, or because we start to immediately<br/>&gt; &gt; imagine it as part of a diatonic scale, or at least start to<br/>&gt; &gt; imagine a &quot;significant subset&quot; of the diatonic scale sufficient<br/>&gt; &gt; enough to impress upon us the quality of minorness.<br/>&gt; &gt; 3) Initially, Occam&apos;s razor suggests the former.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course it does. I can also remember hearing it as sad<br/>&gt; and discussing this with my grandmother in one of my first<br/>&gt; piano lessons when I was 4, before I really had much of a<br/>&gt; handle on the diatonic scale. Of course you can argue about<br/>&gt; exposure in the womb and so on, but let&apos;s face it: most music<br/>&gt; hangs out on arpeggios and pentatonics -- especially most<br/>&gt; popular music -- and most adults couldn&apos;t sing simple<br/>&gt; diatonic patterns if their life depended on it.</p><p>It&apos;s good that you started playing when you were really young - I also<br/>started playing when I was young, somewhere around 2. (Ironically, I<br/>was also taught by my grandmother.) And my perspective is that I think<br/>I would have had to have lived in an isolation chamber away from all<br/>music and then hear a minor chord for the first time to really<br/>determine if it comes from psychoacoustics and sounds sad. I don&apos;t<br/>think it has to do with exposure in the womb, but exposure out of the<br/>womb in early life to music. Listening to a few pieces in minor is<br/>probably sufficient for you to associate the feeling with the bare<br/>minor triad for the rest of your life, especially at an early age...<br/>People today can barely sing diatonically at all, but they still<br/>understand something about the template intuitively. I don&apos;t really<br/>think that the &quot;full diatonic scale&quot; is necessary for it to sound the<br/>way it does, but rather just perhaps a very small subset. I think it<br/>has something to do with leading tones and falling tones, more on that<br/>later (sort of a generalization of the tritone hypothesis that makes<br/>sense to me).</p><p>But by itself, a minor chord is just a sort of sound-object, so I<br/>don&apos;t know why it would be sad... The &quot;mapping-as-auditory-biasing&quot;<br/>hypothesis I outlined at the end of my last email would explain this.</p><p>&gt; 2. the mavila[7] experiment produces results, in<br/>&gt; both me and Igs and anyone who will ever try it, that are<br/>&gt; consistent only with the former hypothesis.</p><p>It produces the same result with me, but it is consistent with the<br/>latter hypothesis as well: when I hear a ssLsssL scale, it sounds like<br/>a shifting mix of aeolian and phrygian as I go up the scale. Keep in<br/>mind that &quot;aeolian&quot; and &quot;phrygian&quot; are words that to me represent two<br/>very distinct musical feelings, as do the words &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; to<br/>you. It has just occurred to me that perhaps there is a huge<br/>disconnect in communication here because of how we&apos;re perceiving these<br/>words.</p><p>But I also hear the same shades of meaning in 7-tet, where it&apos;s all<br/>the same. So the first hypothesis would explain this by saying that<br/>different diatonic maps are being applied.</p><p>Damn, I wish Paul would just join the list back for this conversation.<br/>I gave him the same exact argument and he responded as I just did. You<br/>have good points too, however.</p><p>&gt; Even if I agreed with that I don&apos;t see how it would<br/>&gt; confound anything. The only potentially &apos;rooted&apos; interval<br/>&gt; in this size range is 19:16 and it almost certainly<br/>&gt; approximates 6:5. But even if it didn&apos;t, it&apos;s at least as<br/>&gt; easy for me to claim it reminds people of a minor triad<br/>&gt; vs. reminding them of the minor scale.</p><p>Does C-D-Eb, played simultaneously in 12-tet, sound like minor to you?</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t understand. 16:19:24 may or may not have a life<br/>&gt; of its own -- I doubt it, but I should listen to it again<br/>&gt; and see what it does to 2010 Carl. Even if it did, it<br/>&gt; would have very low tonalness compared to something like<br/>&gt; 4:5:6.</p><p>I really do understand what you&apos;re getting at, and if you&apos;re right, it<br/>would probably be the most brilliant insight into the workings of<br/>music ever. Minor songs would sound sad because you have a tonal<br/>heirarchy emphasizing a sonority that sounds ambiguous; auditory scene<br/>analysis stuff would reveal this sound-object that is unknown and<br/>hence may be a threat, hence sadness. Major songs would sound happy<br/>because the tonal heirarchy would emphasize a sonority that sounds<br/>rooted and resolved; the whole structure can be understood better, and<br/>hence represents not a threat, happiness. The blues would be explained<br/>as African Americans, while stuck in a hellish world of misery, having<br/>figured out that the typical &quot;happy/sad&quot; divide of major and minor can<br/>be resolved if minor is played on top of major, thus envisioning the<br/>minor third as 16:19 (C-E-Bb-C-Eb-G, for example, might work best if<br/>tuned this way), hence the minor third starts to become otonal and<br/>rooted and &quot;major&quot; by your earlier definition.</p><p>It is elegant and intuitive, and correlates brilliantly with lots of<br/>things, and could probably lead one to become quite euphorically manic<br/>if followed for a long time. However, after the supermajor example I<br/>played for you - when 5/4 clearly takes the role of 75/64 (which is a<br/>color in and of itself in my world, or at least aug2 chords are, a la<br/>C-E-B-D#. They aren&apos;t just altered large seconds) - I can&apos;t see that<br/>as being the case anymore. Perhaps it still is in a way that I am<br/>missing.</p><p>The blues can be also explained as an alternate tonal set that happens<br/>to be a mode of Paul&apos;s standard pentachordal major.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 5) This is the same assumption as just that we&apos;re conditioned<br/>&gt; &gt; to hear how a minor third could fit in with other diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; notes and that minorness arises from that, so Occam&apos;s razor no<br/>&gt; &gt; longer suggests the former.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t you think it&apos;s simpler if something reminds people<br/>&gt; of 1 additional note vs. 5 additional notes?</p><p>I don&apos;t think that all 5 additional notes need to be imagined for the<br/>minor triad to take on its familiar &quot;minor&quot; role. It might be only<br/>one. It might, in fact, be just that the three notes in the minor<br/>triad make up their own little mini-map, which is then cognized. My<br/>point is that I think meaning comes from a subconscious cognizing of<br/>the mini-map, rather than inherently from the VF&apos;s produced. I think<br/>this is because you can push a 5/4 into crazy situations where it has<br/>a completely different meaning produced, and because you manage to<br/>cognize it in a totally different way, despite the same VF&apos;s being<br/>produced. I think there is simply just another level of music left to<br/>explore (semiology literature, anyone? Anyone know any good books?).<br/>But the more that I talk about this the more I start to think what we<br/>are saying overlaps somewhat...</p><p>&gt; &gt; 6) The point of the mavila example was not whether the last<br/>&gt; &gt; chord seems major at first sight, but whether you CAN make it<br/>&gt; &gt; sound like a &quot;really flat major&quot; if you try.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can make anything seem any way with categorical perception.<br/>&gt; I played a 7/8-scale piano keyboard for a day and when I got<br/>&gt; home the keys on my piano looked like giant canoes. So what?</p><p>How do you explain this then? In the supermajor example I posted, the<br/>melody is still recognizable, and 5/4 takes on the extremely<br/>bittersweet, sad characteristic that the D# takes in C-E-B-D#. Even at<br/>the end, when I play C-G-C under the melody, the C-G-C-D# (which is a<br/>2:3:4:5 and clearly has a fundamental of 1) STILL has the color of<br/>that bittersweet chord I posted above (although one can flip it<br/>around). Hence if we&apos;re defining major and minor as colors, then this<br/>is another color I know from my vast experiments with expanded<br/>diatonic harmony, and I got 2:3:4:5 to sound like it. That is...<br/>significant!</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you can&apos;t, mess around with mavila[5] (NOT mavila[7]) for<br/>&gt; &gt; a while and I guarantee you will find yourself in the<br/>&gt; &gt; situation more than once where major thirds sound minor<br/>&gt; &gt; and minor thirds sound major.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you phrase this in a way where I&apos;ll have a chance of<br/>&gt; knowing if it&apos;s happened or not? Like, &quot;Mess around with<br/>&gt; mavila[5] and I guarantee you&apos;ll temporarily experience<br/>&gt; hearing a mavila-approximate 10:12:15 triad sound happy&quot;,<br/>&gt; or...?</p><p>When you listen to a neutral triad, you can either hear it as a very<br/>flat major triad, or a very sharp minor triad. When you mess around<br/>with mavila[5], you will sometimes hear times when that minor third<br/>sounds like a very, very, very flat major third, and vice versa. That<br/>is, it takes on the quality of &quot;major,&quot; but just sounds flat as hell.<br/>And after enough exposure to mavila, I don&apos;t hear it as sounding &quot;flat<br/>as hell&quot; anymore; that is, while it never sounds like 5/4, it doesn&apos;t<br/>sound irritatingly &quot;wrong,&quot; just different.</p><p>So the question is, is this because you&apos;re perceiving 6/5 as a very<br/>flat 5/4? Or because you start to cognize the 6/5 in the same way that<br/>you cognize 5/4? I believe that the latter is the case, because there<br/>are certain &quot;cues&quot; that make this trick work. One is to play with the<br/>pentatonic scale by transposing a fifth up it. Go C-G -&gt; D-A -&gt; E-C -&gt;<br/>G-D -&gt; A-E and so on. That E-C will still be minor if you focus on it,<br/>but starts to pick up some of the &quot;majorness&quot; of the major pentatonic<br/>one. Stacking fifths like C-G-D-A-E can sometimes get the E to sound<br/>pseudo-&quot;major&quot; ish, especially if it&apos;s all in one octave, and preceded<br/>by a subminor triad. 23-equal or 30-equal I find are good tuning for<br/>these.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92844 href="#92844">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2010 1:02:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A quick afterthought: the more I think about it, the more I realize<br/>that the mapping-as-auditory-system-priming hypothesis makes sense.

Also, what is the relationship between otonality and majorness, as well as &quot;larger interval first&quot; and majorness?  Consider the following three examples:</p><p>4:5:6 vs. 10:12:15: 4:5:6 is lower in the series, thus the &quot;otonal&quot; member of the pair.  It also has a larger interval--5/4--first.</p><p>6:7:9 vs. 14:18:21: 6:7:9 is lower in the series, thus the &quot;otonal&quot; member of the pair, yet it has a smaller interval--7/6--first.

For some of us, IOW, the change-blindness might not be there. So how do we know if our templates have enough in common to support generalizations?</p><p>They don&apos;t. And I&apos;m not trying to make generalizations, and sorry if I<br/>came off that way. But the point that I&apos;m making is - I think musical<br/>meaning emerges from the templates, whatever they are. They emerge<br/>from the cognization of some kind of template. They do not emerge from<br/>the fundamental. That is, at least, my theory, although now that the<br/>discussion between me and Carl is getting more interesting, perhaps I<br/>will change my mind about that.</p><p>But you said that sus4 chords to you sounded like exaggerated major<br/>chords, as did supermajor chords. That indicates to me that you&apos;re<br/>fitting them to some kind of major template. They definitely do not<br/>sound like major chords to me; I can imagine different things that I<br/>&quot;can do&quot; with them than what I can do with major. This is part of the<br/>&quot;meaning&quot; of the sus4 chord in my world.</p><p>My recent enlightenment, I think, is this: there is no scale. The<br/>scale is an abstraction that doesn&apos;t exist. It exists for convenience.<br/>When you hear the &quot;meaning&quot; of a chord, part of what you are hearing<br/>is that it can move around in pitch space, which does not necessarily<br/>have to correlate to JI and is not limited to any scale.</p><p>So if I knew a musical system in which a supermajor chord &quot;did<br/>something different&quot; than a major chord, I would stop trying to cram<br/>it into the major chord template and it would suddenly stop sounding<br/>so dissonant. And this is where I think psychoacoustics DOES play into<br/>it: we want discordant sonorities to resolve to concordant ones. The<br/>exact type of concordance, though, I think isn&apos;t important.</p><p>Carl&apos;s theory seems to be that there are only two types of concordance<br/>that we distinguish between: that of the fully tonal sonority (major)<br/>and that of the half-tonal but not rough sonority (minor). It&apos;s an<br/>interesting theory, and one that I am open to. I&apos;m not entirely sure I<br/>believe it, since minor thirds in isolation still sound minor to me,<br/>even if they&apos;re 7/6. But I am open to it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The real question, to me anyway, is whether we can ascribe qualities of &quot;majorness&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or &quot;minorness&quot; to any triad, or just those that are &quot;close enough&quot; to something familiar<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (and how close is &quot;close enough&quot;?). Why is this the &quot;real question&quot; to me? Because the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; limits of what can be perceived as major/minor are the limits of possible tonal bases<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (basises?) for musical systems. I have some hypotheses, but nothing fleshed out yet.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Igs: did you listen to the mavila example?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. Didn&apos;t fool me.</p><p>The point isn&apos;t whether or not it fooled you - it isn&apos;t supposed to<br/>&quot;fool&quot; you. The point is whether or not you CAN get the last sonority<br/>to sound like a flat &quot;major&quot; by playing around with your perception of<br/>it. So far, the tally is that most people can get it to sound sort of<br/>&quot;major,&quot; but in a weird way that is kind of &quot;wrong.&quot; After playing<br/>with this chord for the last month, I can easily flip my perception of<br/>it around to major, and it no longer sounds &quot;wrong&quot; to me, just<br/>&quot;different.&quot; That is, I have managed to get the minor third into the<br/>major third position in my internal template - or have I?</p><p>Let&apos;s assume that this happens to you at some point (it&apos;s much easier<br/>with mavila[5], which still follows the same intervallic pattern as<br/>meantone[5]; mavila[7] is where it diverges). When this happens, the<br/>fundamental question is:</p><p>1) Is this minor third taking on some imprint of the &quot;major&quot; sonority<br/>because I&apos;m perceiving 6/5 as 5/4, and the major sonority comes<br/>directly from the JI relationship we&apos;re perceiving it as?<br/>2) Or, is this minor third taking on some imprint of the &quot;major&quot;<br/>sonority because I&apos;m cramming the minor third into the &quot;major third&quot;<br/>position in some cognitive map I have, and the major sonority comes<br/>directly from that map?</p><p>This is, I think, the disagreement that Carl and I are having.</p><p>&gt; I did, however, mis-phrase the above sentence. I should have said, &quot;The real question to me is whether we can ascribe qualities of majorness and minorness to any *pair* of otonal-utonal related triads.&quot; Another good question is whether majorness and minorness can be ascribed to a pair of triads that are NOT otonal-utonal related.</p><p>C-Eb-G-B-D is mostly otonal, but sounds minor to me. I don&apos;t think<br/>Carl is saying that minorness is coming from utonality though. I think<br/>he&apos;s saying it comes from polytonality, in a sense. Polytonality<br/>without roughness or discordance. It&apos;s an interesting theory and takes<br/>advantage of the fact that &quot;rooted&quot; intervals have a fundamental that<br/>is octave-equivalent to the lower note in the dyad, and octave<br/>equivalence takes on special significance in the mammalian brain. I&apos;m<br/>still on the fence with it.</p><p>&gt; 4:5:6 vs. 10:12:15: 4:5:6 is lower in the series, thus the &quot;otonal&quot; member of the pair. It also has a larger interval--5/4--first.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6:7:9 vs. 14:18:21: 6:7:9 is lower in the series, thus the &quot;otonal&quot; member of the pair, yet it has a smaller interval--7/6--first. It tends to sound &quot;minor&quot; in comparison to its utonal partner.</p><p>I think there are different qualities to the &quot;minor&quot; chord that we all<br/>know and love, and you are picking one of them and defining all of<br/>minorness as being related to that. I&apos;ll come up with another<br/>listening example and we&apos;ll see how it goes. I predict that if you<br/>play a chord like C Eb G B D Fv Av - where Fv and Av are 11/4 and 13/4<br/>respectively - that it will still sound &quot;minor&quot; in another more<br/>fundamental way, despite being almost entirely otonal.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92849 href="#92849">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2010 1:33:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Sep 15, 2010 at 4:25 PM, cameron &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When you listen to a neutral triad, you can either hear it as a very<br/>&gt; &gt; flat major triad, or a very sharp minor triad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ?????!

Even within a single scale, there are<br/>going to be &quot;avoid notes&quot; that you don&apos;t want to sustain over a<br/>particular chord. There are simply different levels of &quot;organizational<br/>relatedness&quot; that arise in some way that I don&apos;t fully understand<br/>(perhaps having to do with psychoacoustics, perhaps due to unrelated<br/>cognitive factors), and we as humans group them into discrete<br/>categories - chord tones, nonchord tones that are consonant, avoid<br/>notes that are consonant on some chords but not others, and notes that<br/>are &quot;out of the scale.&quot; When you start investigating other tonal<br/>structures like the blues, these distinctions break down and are drawn<br/>differently (the difference between &quot;avoid note&quot; and &quot;chromatic note&quot;<br/>becomes quite blurry).

And if I go back down, I can hear it<br/>differently, with that VIIaug sounding almost like major if played<br/>quick enough, etc. So my perception of this scale seems to be entirely<br/>due to diatonic template stuff, although the more I mess with it the<br/>more the templates seem to merge into one mavila template which is<br/>ambiguous and includes both.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Does C-D-Eb, played simultaneously in 12-tet, sound like<br/>&gt; &gt; minor to you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It sounds discordant.</p><p>But does it sound sad like minor, or happy like major? How about<br/>C-Eb-D, with the D up an octave? How about that vs C-D-E and C-E-D?</p><p>&gt; It should be obvious that it&apos;s right, but I hardly think it&apos;s<br/>&gt; such a great insight! In fact I think it&apos;s so pedestrian that<br/>&gt; I hardly ever mention it.</p><p>But for the mapping thing does matter as well. I am basically going<br/>with your theory and the mapping theory in parallel at this point,<br/>since they both seem to make decent predictions and require roughly<br/>equal amounts of assumptions, and have times when they both break down<br/>(for my perception). I expect somewhere down the road I will discover<br/>some way to tie them in together - the mapping as auditory biasing<br/>would be one way of doing that, but there could be others. And that<br/>would be quite the insight to make, I think, and probably be the holy<br/>grail of music theory.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The blues would be explained<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, the blues! Something to think about when I&apos;m not late<br/>&gt; for a convention. The minor pentatonic... a mode of the<br/>&gt; pentatonic with a minor chord at the bottom... just like the<br/>&gt; case with the major and minor diatonic modes.</p><p>Right. As I said in my addendum, I don&apos;t think that the full diatonic<br/>scale is what gives the minor chord its sound, since C dorian #4 and C<br/>phrygian have different notes in every position besides the minor<br/>triad, and it still sounds minor.</p><p>What I wrote about &quot;there is no scale&quot; and mini-maps fitting into an<br/>infinitude of larger maps I think applies here.</p><p>&gt; 75/64 has no identity in terms of tunable-by-ear ratios,<br/>&gt; and questionable identity any other way. But for someone<br/>&gt; with high-functioning AP, I&apos;m sure every interval has its<br/>&gt; own color.</p><p>It isn&apos;t as much the 75/64, it&apos;s just that when you play C-E-B-D#,<br/>which is a very bittersweet sound, the D# would be &quot;ideally&quot; tuned<br/>75/64. If the theory that chord qualities derive from psychoacoustics,<br/>then I would imagine the bittersweetness of this chord derives from<br/>that the 75/64 is &quot;what we&apos;re hearing&quot; (or 75/32 in this case).</p><p>&gt; &gt; How do you explain this then? In the supermajor example I posted,<br/>&gt; &gt; the melody is still recognizable, and 5/4 takes on the extremely<br/>&gt; &gt; bittersweet, sad characteristic that the D# takes in C-E-B-D#.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the kind of thing I wish you&apos;d pointed out when I had<br/>&gt; the example and score on my desktop. Too late now.</p><p>Perhaps I should just come up with a 12-tet example and then the supermajor one.</p><p>&gt; Honestly, I don&apos;t think I can keep up with this level of tuning list<br/>&gt; involvement.</p><p>Haha, me neither. I&apos;m going back to Haiti in a few days for 3 weeks. I<br/>think I need some time to organize all of these new ideas, there are a<br/>lot of new thoughts here.</p><p>&gt; &gt; When you listen to a neutral triad, you can either hear it<br/>&gt; &gt; as a very flat major triad, or a very sharp minor triad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose it depends on the context, but generally I&apos;m more<br/>&gt; like Cameron in that I tend to hear it as a neutral triad.</p><p>But you can &quot;flip&quot; the chord around to hear it as a flat major or a<br/>sharp minor, right?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92873 href="#92873">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2010 8:12:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt; On Tue, Sep 14, 2010 at 3:57 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&gt; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; After the i-iv-v-iv-i, does the melody sound like G-C-D-Eb-D-C to you?<br/>&gt;&gt; No.<br/>&gt; //<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t think they are unpleasant, though my on experiments with using them in place of major thirds suggests they aren&apos;t very good major thirds.

Again, I&apos;m amazed to hear how my perception differs from yours<br/>here... It just sounds like obnoxious useless beating noise to you...?<br/>Seriously, when I play C-D-Eb, I hear a clustered voicing that sounds<br/>unmistakably &quot;minor,&quot; with sadness arising and all of that.</p><p>This is really a quite astonishing observation for me, as I use<br/>voicings like that when I play all the time, and now I wonder it<br/>sounds like to everyone else... I&apos;ll use voicings like G-E-F-G-A-E for<br/>Gsus13 all the time, played at the same time, and I wonder if everyone<br/>else hears it as noise.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But for the mapping thing does matter as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree.

When you see a hammer, you&apos;re not just<br/>aware of what it feels and looks like, but also what it &quot;can do.&quot; This<br/>forms part of the meaning for that hammer. I would expect a similar<br/>process works with chords. So when you hear a chord, part of the<br/>feeling that emerges comes from an awareness of what a chord &quot;could<br/>do&quot; or how it &quot;could function&quot; in any musical setting that you have<br/>learned so far (or ones that logically follow from those). I just<br/>listened to Igs&apos; 16-tet clip, and I heard a lot of really bright stuff<br/>that sounded really familiar. He avoided the fifth and just played<br/>dom9 chords without it.</p><p>My brain, of course, would have no idea that he was in 16-tet if you<br/>just played that clip in isolation, because the concept of 16-tet is<br/>just an abstraction that doesn&apos;t really exist. I might also be in<br/>16000-tet, where some kind of meantone fifth still exists alongside<br/>the mavila one.</p><p>(If I say the word &quot;shit,&quot; it still has a meaning whether I use it in<br/>a sentence or not; I would expect something similar happens with<br/>chords.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; It isn&apos;t as much the 75/64, it&apos;s just that when you play<br/>&gt; &gt; C-E-B-D#, which is a very bittersweet sound, the D# would be<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;ideally&quot; tuned 75/64.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (grumbling noises) Stop analyzing xenharmonic with 12-ET!</p><p>It isn&apos;t 12-ET; it&apos;s meantone.

But I think I just<br/>gained a bit of insight into why that is. This comes after a long,<br/>long meditation on our recent conversation. Something about your<br/>nontonalness insight struck me as profound, and I wanted to figure out<br/>what. I noted that there are a LOT of &quot;patterns&quot; that emerge with the<br/>minor chord, and one of them has to be &quot;it.&quot; The utonality one is sort<br/>of close sometimes, but isn&apos;t quite it. Yours is much, much closer,<br/>although as you noted sometimes breaks down, and I think still<br/>reflects a brilliant insight that I wanted to fully understand. So I<br/>did a lot of ruminating and this is what I came to. This is very long,<br/>so you will probably want to read this in parts, but it is my complete<br/>train of thought, and I feel I should say it.</p><p>Dissonance can be PAINFUL. Think fingernails on a chalkboard painful.<br/>Think my listening examples that you hated painful. It can be so<br/>painful that we&apos;d rather listen to silence than listen to it. That is<br/>to say, we don&apos;t like it. I don&apos;t know how psychoacoustics can lead to<br/>happiness and sadness, but I do know that it can lead to displeasure,<br/>and that displeasure can lead to sadness. So strike one for liberal<br/>cultural relativism.</p><p>Let&apos;s make some predictions. The most dissonant interval that I can<br/>think of is slightly flatter than a semitone, preferably 1\17. It&apos;s so<br/>dissonant that it functions as a &quot;depriming&quot; interval that makes us<br/>hear the next note as a definitive movement away from the last one and<br/>hence works great for melody. I believe it&apos;s near the global maximum<br/>of harmonic entropy too. Let&apos;s look at what happens if we take the<br/>harmonic series and detune different notes by something near this<br/>interval, which I will refer to as the &quot;depriming interval.&quot; There may<br/>be other ways to do this, but this is the first one I tried.</p><p>To do this, let&apos;s pick a tuning system where something decently close<br/>to this depriming interval exists. I think 12 notes per octave should<br/>do, no doubt much to your chagrin. So I&apos;m going to make some 12-tet<br/>predictions, because it works there too and even explains chords I&apos;ve<br/>been using all my life, and makes this theory easy to communicate to<br/>you. I will end with a few xenharmonic predictions and leave the rest<br/>for you to have fun and see what you can find. Maybe there&apos;s a way to<br/>extend this further. I think there is a pattern here that you will no<br/>doubt see and understand intuitively and from a psychoacoustic<br/>standpoint, and perhaps be able to extend.</p><p>Please play the following chords, and keep in mind exactly what<br/>they&apos;re approximating. Play a C an octave below all of these. You will<br/>also note, if you ever do this in JI, that when a combination of<br/>intervals is detuned so as to push the whole thing into another<br/>&quot;concordant&quot; sonority, the illusion is completely destroyed, as you<br/>predicted.</p><p>C-E -&gt; happy. make sure you keep the octave below this.<br/>C-Eb -&gt; sad. to avoid yourself as hearing Ab as the root, play C an<br/>octave below, as I said.<br/>C-F -&gt; happy, because you end up with an otonal sonority despite the C<br/>in the bass, as you predicted. It&apos;s just too concordant. Go to C-E+ or<br/>some kind of slightly sharp supermajor third and it&apos;ll get painful and<br/>slightly sad, or disturbingly manic perhaps. Note that people often<br/>hear supermajor triads as having a bit of sadness to them.</p><p>C-Eb-G -&gt; detune the E, and get C-Eb-G -- sad.<br/>C-Eb-Gb -&gt; detune the G and the E, and get C-Eb-Gb - more sad, so sad<br/>that it&apos;s hopeless.<br/>C-E+-G -&gt; make the E sharp, but not as sharp as F. Find some middle<br/>ground of discordance. Supermajor perhaps. Sad. This can&apos;t be done in<br/>12-tet.<br/>C-E-F# -&gt; make the G flat to C-E-F#. Needs to be done in JI for the<br/>full effect, but works decently well in 12-tet. Sounds like lydian.<br/>Kind of sad, but in a different way than minor. Works better if the F#<br/>is flat - try 16:20:23.<br/>C-E-G# -&gt; make the G sharp to C-E-G#. Really needs to be in JI to get<br/>the full effect - try 16:20:25.8. Pretty painful. Detuning the fifth<br/>seems to be more painful than detuning the third (this is going to be<br/>a theme and I&apos;m sure you can see why)</p><p>Let&apos;s go to 4 notes. I&apos;m going to call it C-E-G-Bb, I don&apos;t want to<br/>hear any complaining.</p><p>C-Eb-G-Bb -&gt; detune the E, get C-Eb-G-Bb - not quite as sad as C-Eb-G,<br/>the Bb stabilizes it a bit.<br/>C-Eb-G-B -&gt; detune two notes, predicting more dissonance and pain.<br/>Change the E and the Bb, so go to C-Eb-G-B. Holy $#&amp;#, this is sad,<br/>even more so than C minor. If you detune the B so that it goes to A,<br/>it&apos;s also equally sad, and happens to be sort of near with the 7-limit<br/>utonality. If you make the A a little sharper than the 12-tet one it&apos;s<br/>sadder. Find some maximum of harmonic entropy.<br/>C-E-Gb-B -&gt; detune three notes. You get C-Eb-Gb-B, which is even<br/>sadder, hopeless, sinister, etc. Or C-Eb-Gb-A.<br/>C-E-F#-Bb and C-E-G#-Bb -&gt; these are sort of like the other discordant<br/>examples, but less dissonant. Stabilized. Not sad, but curious. Note<br/>how the meaning changes as you get in between consonance and<br/>dissonance. This works better in JI.<br/>C-E-G-A/C-E-G-B -&gt; detune the Bb, get C-E-G-A or C-E-G-B. Both of<br/>these are &quot;happy&quot; like major, but also a bit sad (as you yourself<br/>described). Make the A sharp and it&apos;s even more sad. This effect is<br/>intensified if you go into JI and make the B a little bit sharp.<br/>C-E+-G-B+ -&gt; for heightened sadness, make the major thirds both 9/7&apos;s<br/>or slightly sharper. More sad.</p><p>I&apos;ll spare you the full set, but I&apos;ll bring you to a few more notable ones:<br/>Start with C-E-G-Bb-D -  Make the B sharp, and you go to C-E-G-B-D.<br/>Sad. Make the D sharp, and go to C-E-G-B-D#. Really sad, bittersweet.<br/>This is the chord I took advantage of in my supermajor example, where<br/>I got that D# to be intoned as 5/2 above C. Again correlating with the<br/>notion that if you place notes a depriming interval away from the<br/>harmonic series, it sounds more dissonant, more painful, and sadder.<br/>Detune the G to F# - you get C-E-F#-B-D#. Even more so, but starts to<br/>sound concordant in a way because the F#-B-D# forms a major triad.<br/>This mixture of biting dissonance and concordance is going to come in<br/>handy in forming a definition of what &quot;minor&quot; is.</p><p>Start with 4:5:6:7:9:11 and detune to 12-tet C-Eb-G-A-D-F# (or B-D-F#)<br/>- this is an approximate 4:5:6:7:9:11 in which the 5 is flattened by a<br/>depriming interval, the 7 is flattened by a priming interval, the 9 is<br/>left alone, and the 11 is sharpened by a priming interval. This is<br/>sad. The sadness can again be enhanced by going to anti-JI and<br/>detuning things. The F# isn&apos;t quite sharp enough, and if you make it<br/>sharper, it&apos;s, as predicted, more dissonant, and more painful, and<br/>hence more poignant. Same with the A.</p><p>C-Eb-G-B-D-F#-A -- This is the same chord with a B in the 7/4 position<br/>and an A on top approximating an anti-13/8. I can intuitively tell<br/>that if I make the A sharper, it&apos;ll be more biting and dissonant, and<br/>so it is.</p><p>This also predicts new xenharmonic chords, which is why I seem to be<br/>having a psychotic break from reality:</p><p>Start with C-E-G-Bb-D. Detune one note and you get C-Eb-G-Bb-D - a bit<br/>sadder. Detune one more and you get C-Eb-G-B-D - sadder still. Detune<br/>that last D to C-Eb-G-B-D#. Well, it&apos;s &quot;almost&quot; sadder, but not quite,<br/>because in 12-tet Eb and D# are the same thing. Go to 19-tet and it<br/>works -really- well. This successful prediction is what encouraged me<br/>to continue this train of thought.</p><p>Another xenharmonic prediction that I just came up with while typing<br/>this that works: Go to scala, and go to the chord creator, and put the<br/>&quot;decimal&quot; feature on. Try this chord:<br/>1/1 - 19/16 - 3/2 - 12/7 - 8.8/4 - 8/3 - 12.9/4</p><p>Note that I&apos;m creating a combination of divergent notes from the<br/>series, and convergent notes with the series, which I think is<br/>essential to defining the &quot;minor&quot; sound. It&apos;s in between pain and<br/>pleasure and in between consonance and dissonance. And in fact, if you<br/>screw around with this enough, you will see sinister evilness morph<br/>into despair morph into sadness morph into being not happy but being<br/>chilled out morph into being nostalgic morph into being&quot;cool&quot; morph<br/>into being &quot;earthy&quot; morph into being &quot;mystical&quot;. Try something like<br/>this back in 12-tet: C-E-G becoming C-Eb-G, sad. C-E-G-Bb becoming<br/>C-E-G-B, happy yet sad, wistful, nostalgic. C-E-G-Bb-D becoming<br/>C-E-G-Bb-Eb, hendrix chord, &quot;cool.&quot; C-E-G-Bb-D-F# is itself a detuned<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11, and sounds &quot;mystical.&quot; These sounds are representative<br/>of different ways in which consonance and dissonance, and the feelings<br/>they produce are representative of different ways in which pleasure<br/>and pain interact.</p><p>There were a few other chords that we couldn&apos;t do in 12-tet. Try<br/>different ways of making the 5 and 6 in 4:5:6 sharper, but note that<br/>if you go too far with it, you&apos;ll end up getting to 3:4:5, which<br/>destroys the painfulness as it starts being tonal (or concordant), as<br/>your prediction states. One is a major sixth chord with a sixth that&apos;s<br/>a bit sharper. Try 1/1 - 5/4 - 3/2 - 12/6. This to me is a very<br/>interesting sonority that isn&apos;t quite sad, somewhere on a lower level<br/>than sad. Make 5/4 become 14/11 and it becomes a bit sadder. Make the<br/>3/2 become something like 49/32 and you have yourself a<br/>semi-consonant, somewhat painful but not too much, very colorful<br/>tetrad. 1/1 - 5/4 - 3/2 - 15/8 too - detune the 15/8 even more to<br/>27/14 and you have something more painful, but still kind of painless<br/>and rooted with the 4:5:6. Make the 5/4 become 9/7 and it pops to<br/>life. Make the 5/4 become 13/10 and it becomes more sad, but make the<br/>15/8 become 39/20. Seemed like it was going to become less sad, but<br/>the 39/30 is close enough to 2/1 that it starts to sound concordant,<br/>and hence doesn&apos;t freak you out and stimulate your heartbeat, or sound<br/>like nails on a chalkboard, or resemble the call of an ancient<br/>predator, or whatever lead this feature of the auditory system to<br/>evolve.</p><p>Note one last thing: I have left open the question of how to tune<br/>these things. Do we want them to beat like hell and be maximally<br/>discordant, or make them maximally concordant? And my answer is -<br/>whatever you want. If you like the sound of there being no roughness,<br/>tune them concordantly. If you want your minor triads to sound rooted,<br/>go with 16:19:24. If you want them to sound simpler and have the<br/>thirds be 5/4, go with 10:12:15. If you want them to be LESS biting,<br/>go a bit further away from the priming interval. 6:7:9 is more serene<br/>(and almost rooted), as are neutral triads. If you want them to be<br/>more biting as far as my ears go, make the minor third a bit sharp,<br/>maybe around 333 cents.</p><p>A few random odds and ends: this is an abstraction of the &quot;major is<br/>happy, minor is sad, diminished is depressingly&quot; sad concept. Note how<br/>often this aligns with utonal chords, which might be decent for tuning<br/>these sonorities if you want to avoid beating. Minorness is a mixture<br/>of tones that are divergent from the series, as well as tones that are<br/>convergent with the series, thus in between pleasure and pain, a<br/>mixture of both. I hypothesize that if we work out the math and come<br/>up with the &quot;most discordant sound,&quot; it will BE the nails on a<br/>chalkboard sound. I have read that this response evolved because it<br/>resembles the call of an ancient predator. Hence any psychoacoustic<br/>feature can be used to make music.</p><p>The structure of scales, modes, and tonality becomes very, very<br/>interesting when looked at from this perspective. We have studied<br/>consonance so far, henceforth I want to delve into dissonance.</p><p>I only hope that you hear this the same way I do. One last prediction:<br/>these two chords should be somewhat roughly equivalent in &quot;sadness&quot;<br/>from a 12-tet standpoint:</p><p>C-Eb-G<br/>C-E-G-B-D-F#</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92916 href="#92916">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2010 3:09:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Sep 17, 2010 at 5:24 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A few random odds and ends: this is an abstraction of the &quot;major is<br/>&gt; happy, minor is sad, diminished is depressingly&quot; sad concept.

If you flatten or sharpen the 6 in 4:6 by<br/>this amount, it sounds unstable and discordant and painful. If you<br/>keep the 4:6 the same and make it 4:5:6, and flatten the 5 by this<br/>amount, it&apos;s not so painful, just &quot;sad.&quot; If you sharpen it by about<br/>this amount, you get supermajor, which is disturbingly manic and a bit<br/>sad. The idea is that the higher up the overtone series you do this,<br/>the less effective the &quot;pain&quot; is, and if you do it to more than one<br/>interval, you make things even more painful, and hence more sad.<br/>Flatten the 5 in 4:5:6:7 by this amount and also flatten or sharpen<br/>the 7, and you get something even more despairing and sad than minor.<br/>You will find a predictable and consistent pattern for this all up and<br/>down the series, unless you flatten or sharpen things in a way that it<br/>starts to form another chunk of the series. You might need to temper<br/>things by less than 65 cents as overtones get closer together; use<br/>your ear and find what&apos;s most discordant.</p><p>So perhaps it would be a worthwhile venture for us to explore linear<br/>temperaments that contain lots of discordant notes in addition to lots<br/>of consonant notes, which might be useful for generating some kind of<br/>new type of tonal system in addition to the new ones we already have.<br/>If you temper out the difference between a 5/4 lowered by this<br/>interval and 6/5, we already have our first regular temperament with<br/>this expanded JI/anti-JI pitch space. Perhaps we could call it &quot;minor<br/>temperament&quot; or something.</p><p>Any thoughts? I think it might be a decent idea, and has some<br/>psychoacoustic basis to it. Probably why I also liked Michael&apos;s PHI<br/>scale so much back in the day. Either way, we should have linear<br/>temperaments that generate an equal amount of pain and pleasure!</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92924 href="#92924">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2010 7:16:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m thinking along the lines of that something along the lines of<br/>&gt; 60-70 cents is some kind of &quot;maximally discordant interval&quot;, hence why<br/>&gt; it&apos;s so great for melody.</p><p>&gt; Any thoughts?</p><p>Temperaments where 28/27 (63 cents) or 25/24 (70.7 cents) are of low complexity come to mind.

So<br/>it&apos;s just a rule of thumb, and you have to use your ears to find the<br/>most discordant possible sonority.</p><p>Hence the theory is, minorness is a watered down version of<br/>ultra-discordance. Dyadic entropy is not triadic entropy, and it&apos;s<br/>definitely not tetradic entropy. 5:4 and 6:5 are concordant dyads, but<br/>so what? How does that apply to the brain trying to fit 5:10:12:15?</p><p>&gt; If I remember correctly Paul Erlich thinks that in pentatonic and<br/>&gt; decatonic scales it&apos;s the more rare *large* steps that function as<br/>&gt; leading tone-like sign posts. Would it then make sense melodically<br/>&gt; to tune them close to the local HE maximum?</p><p>That&apos;s what people have noticed with 17-tet; its melodic properties<br/>are almost unbeatable. Also what Darreg noticed when he said that if<br/>you sharpen the leading tone in 31-tet by a diesis (how does one<br/>pronounce diesis exactly?), it resolves better.</p><p>I have talked to Paul about this; I think his &quot;rare interval&quot; theory<br/>is a decent one, but I&apos;m not entirely sure it covers the matter 100%<br/>to my satisfaction. I think a number of things go into the<br/>construction of some kind of tonality, them being</p><p>1) Having maximally discordant tones lying adjacent to the tonic,<br/>&quot;leading&quot; and &quot;falling&quot; tones<br/>2) Having a wide range of other harmonic chords to &quot;move&quot; to, with<br/>different roots, so that the tonic isn&apos;t the only concordant sonority<br/>to hang out on. Without this, there&apos;s no root movement.<br/>3) Other than that, I view the scale as a tonal abstraction serving<br/>these properties; a conceptual tool for simplification that doesn&apos;t<br/>really exist -except- for melodic purposes, a la Rothenberg.</p><p>Strong version (not the same as Paul&apos;s strong version):<br/>4) The two dissonant intervals should form another dissonant interval<br/>- that can resolve inward or outward to a harmonic sonority,<br/>preferably the tonic.</p><p>So from that perspective, some &quot;tonal&quot; 7-note scales of western music,<br/>if we&apos;re in the 5-limit, would be:</p><p>1) Ionian (C-F-B to C-E-C, or make it G-F-B to C-E-C. But the F-B to<br/>E-C is what&apos;s important)<br/>2) Harmonic Major (C-F-B -&gt; C-E-C, C-Ab-B -&gt; C-G-C, C-F-Ab-B -&gt;<br/>C-E-G-C. Don&apos;t tune the Ab and B to harmonic intervals, but rather to<br/>areas of maximum discordance. Ab might be best a bit flat, B a bit<br/>sharp.)<br/>3) Aeolian (C-D-Ab resolves to C-Eb-G)<br/>4) Harmonic Minor (C-D-Ab-B -&gt; C-Eb-G-C).</p><p>I got these by starting with the notes C F G C, and then filling in<br/>either E or Eb. If we relax the strong version, a ton of other systems<br/>can be used as tonal systems, although you have to learn to be more<br/>creative:</p><p>5) Descending Melodic Major (C D E F G Ab Bb C).<br/>6) Lydian<br/>7) Phrygian<br/>8) A million others</p><p>People have been exploiting Phrygian&apos;s harmonic properties in common<br/>practice music for a while under the guise of the Neapolitan sixth<br/>chord.</p><p>This is just my train of thought, anyway.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=93062 href="#93062">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2010 2:06:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Sep 20, 2010 at 4:32 AM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, it was.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The general approach is interesting, though I don&apos;t always<br/>&gt; agree with your descriptions of the examples... though I would<br/>&gt; appreciate a more test-based approach (preferably blinded).</p><p>This is an earlier description of the theory, actually... this is the<br/>first thing I wrote.

It<br/>generates, in particular, the major -&gt; minor -&gt; diminished sequence of<br/>increasing negativity, and the minor -&gt; minor/maj7 -&gt; minor9/maj7#11<br/>sequence of increasing negativity, and the fact that lydian can<br/>sometimes sound &quot;sad&quot; as can minor. The fact that it predicted that<br/>minor9/maj7#11 could become more harsh by sharpening the 9 (which<br/>isn&apos;t possible in 12-tet without just doubling the minor third) made<br/>me realize there was something going on here...</p><p>Which should be intuitive, because if you take the overtone series and<br/>keep making it more and more discordant, it&apos;s going to sound crappier<br/>and crappier. What I didn&apos;t expect was that if you pretend you don&apos;t<br/>know anything about &quot;minor,&quot; and try to slowly increase the<br/>discordance, minor is one chord in a huge series. And there are chords<br/>equivalent in pain to minor that you can make by keeping the major<br/>third major and detuning a combination of other overtones, above.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=93064 href="#93064">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2010 2:14:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike:</p><p>&gt; I used 12-ET very much on purpose, though.

A way to turn this perceptual and mental distinction into<br/>something real, I think, would be to consider the difference in<br/>discordance between 4:6:7:9 and 3:6:7:9, or between 8:10:12:15 and<br/>5:10:12:15. The latter, in each case, forces the lowest note in each<br/>triad to be heard as the root (although you can &quot;sort of&quot; hear the 1<br/>still in 3:6:7:9), but it is of lower complexity/Tenney height.</p><p>So here&apos;s your unbiased listening test - do you hear 4:6:7:9 or<br/>3:6:7:9 as more discordant?

Could you lay it out concisely?</p><p>Yes. Here&apos;s the simplest form of it, with as few assumptions made as possible.</p><p>1) Extreme discordance can be painful to listen to.<br/>2) By creating an overtone series and detuning the notes in it,<br/>discordance can be created in controlled fashion.<br/>3) By creating discordance, &quot;pain&quot; can be produced.<br/>4) By creating concordance, &quot;pain&quot; can be abetted.<br/>5) By creating a sonority in which pain is only partially present,<br/>musical feelings like &quot;sadness&quot; can be created, which I propose are<br/>just lesser amounts of nails-on-a-chalkboard pain in small doses.<br/>6) If you detune a note enough so as to hit another concordant<br/>sonority which creates a strong and perceptible different &quot;root,&quot;<br/>perhaps simultaneously existing with the first one, the effect will be<br/>destroyed.<br/>7) I predict that as long as 2 and 4 have the perception of being the<br/>root, there will be a &quot;field of discordance&quot; around each interval in<br/>which there approaches a point of maximum discordance, and slowly<br/>resolves into more concordance as it gets further from this point and<br/>starts to approach other concordant dyads.<br/>8) I predict that putting a higher overtone at its point of maximum<br/>discordance with the rest of the sonority will have less of an effect<br/>than a lower overtone, since it is less significant from a<br/>psychoacoustic standpoint.<br/>9) I predict that putting a combination of overtones at their points<br/>of maximum discordance will have more of an effect than just detuning<br/>a single one.<br/>10) I predict that the addition of non-detuned overtones at the points<br/>of maximum -con-cordance will &quot;undo&quot; some of the pain caused by the<br/>detuning of other overtones.<br/>11) Since I claim that minorness is a watered down version of<br/>discordance, or a combination of concordance and discordance, I<br/>predict that putting an overtone at an intermediate point of<br/>discordance can have a musical effect similar to minorness - a slight<br/>amount of pain. So can putting it at a maximum point of discordance<br/>and adding enough concordant overtones. Hence equivalent amounts of<br/>pain can be created from different sounds.<br/>13) At this point the above process is best approached from a<br/>listening perspective to &quot;find&quot; the points of maximum discordance<br/>nearby by ear, until we have n-adic harmonic entropy to do it for us.<br/>This does not diminish the claim that minorness is a watered down<br/>version of extreme discordance, and a proof of concept can still be<br/>drawn nonetheless.<br/>14) I claim that, due to cultural reasons, it may be more pleasant to<br/>find JI intervals that are nearby to the altered discordant ones to<br/>avoid roughness.</p><p>Here is a fully-laid-out example.</p><p>Let&apos;s start with something like 2:4:5:6:7:9:11:13. The 2 is there to<br/>force the perception of the chroma that 2 and 4 share as being the<br/>&quot;root.&quot; We will start with just 2:4:5:6, then detune a note. Then<br/>we&apos;ll add another concordant overtone, and detune it further to see<br/>what happens.</p><p>From 2:4:5:6 - detune 5 to about 333 cents. This becomes more painful<br/>and hence starts to sound minor. I will refer to this as 2:4:5-:6 from<br/>here on out to save having to type so much. You can find equivalent<br/>amounts of sadness and painfulness if you sharpen 5 instead, but for<br/>the purposes of this example we&apos;re going to go the minor route.<br/>From 2:4:5-:6:7 - A bit less painful - may start to sound &quot;major&quot;<br/>again. Sharpen the 7 to somewhere around 15/8 or 27/14 and it should<br/>become more painful, or flatten it to somewhere around 12/7 - use your<br/>ears and find the most painful spot. Note that this corresponds<br/>roughly to the utonal tetrad, which is often heard as minor. We&apos;ll go<br/>with the sharpened route to continue the example. From this point on,<br/>know that you could alter the note either way to find some sweet spot<br/>of discordance, but I&apos;m just going to arbitrarily pick one and keep<br/>going to keep this shorter.<br/>From 2:4:5-:6:7+:9 - May very, very slightly stabilize the chord, but<br/>in a much less perceptible way. Adding 9:11:13 may stabilize it more.<br/>Now sharpen the 9 to about 9.2/4, or maybe sharper. You should hear<br/>the &quot;discordance&quot; increase slightly, but in a way that is starting to<br/>resemble musical &quot;dissonance.&quot; Find the most discordant spot if you<br/>want and be sure to pay attention to intermediate spots.<br/>From 2:4:5-:6:7+:9+:11 - sharpen the 11 to something like 1830-1858<br/>cents and watch the pain increase. Let&apos;s say 1858 cents.<br/>From 2:4:5-:6:7+:9+:11+:13 - sharpen the 13 to something like 2131 cents.<br/>From 2:4:5-:6:7+:9+:11+:13- - Now let&apos;s go back and alter the 6. Make<br/>the 4:6 about something like 650 cents, or 750 cents if you want to go<br/>sharper. Watch the pain change. It may increase slightly, but will be<br/>a detriment as we resolve things back in because it lessens the<br/>rootedness of what&apos;s going on as the 2:4:6 is destroyed. If you put a<br/>1 underneath this, so that the 6 isn&apos;t as important to establishing<br/>the root, there is a clearer increase in pain as 6 is changed, and/or<br/>if you add 3 to the sonority. Let&apos;s say that you add both. Note also<br/>that if you detune 5 and sharpen 6, the 5-:6+ might approach 3:4, and<br/>so 2:5-:6+ approaches a relative 5:6:8. Let&apos;s say you flatten the 6 in<br/>this case to keep it simpler, although you can find similarly<br/>discordant sonorities in the &quot;up&quot; direction. Get 4:6- to be like 650<br/>cents.</p><p>Ending point: 1:2:3:4:5-:6-:7+:9+:11+:13+</p><p>At this point you should have an extremely discordant &quot;ultra-minor&quot;<br/>sonority, and have seen a progression in which minor increases into<br/>ear shrapnel. There are a million progressions you could make of which<br/>&quot;minor&quot; is a part, but to my ears, this is a particularly useful one.<br/>Whether you want to treat it as an abstraction of &quot;minor&quot; or not is up<br/>to you, but it seems more useful than the otonal/utonal concept, which<br/>stops working for a while. Note that the utonal cases which DO work<br/>generally happen to line up with this pattern. Note that if you do<br/>hear 1/1-6/5-3/2-12/7 as a &quot;more minor version&quot; of minor, then you may<br/>also hear 1/1-6/5-3/2-15/8 (or 27/14) as an also &quot;more minor version&quot;<br/>of minor, or at least I do. This perspective predicts both of them.</p><p>Hold your horses! Let&apos;s bring things back in, SLOWLY, and see what happens.</p><p>From 1:2:3:4:5-:6-:7+:9+:11+:13+ to 1:2:3:4:5-:6+:7+:9+:11:13 - bring<br/>the 11 and 13 back to just. Note what is happening to the sound, and<br/>the musical feeling that is being produced.<br/>From 1:2:3:4:5-:6-:7+:9:11:13 to 1:2:3:4:5-:6-:7:9:11:13 - bring the 7<br/>and 9 back to just. Note that this is starting to sound almost major,<br/>as if the 333 cent &quot;minor third&quot; is starting to flip into major third<br/>territory. Until I have n-adic entropy calculated, this is something<br/>that you will have to note by ear. n-adic entropy will predict this.<br/>Or, at least, it will have to, if it&apos;s going to match up with<br/>real-life discordance.<br/>From 1:2:3:4:5-:6-:7:9:11:13 to 1:2:3:4:5--:6-:7:9:11:13 - detune the<br/>333 cents to 6/5 or perhaps even as low as 19/16. Find the sound in<br/>which it&apos;s &quot;most out,&quot; and the pain increases again. Note that the<br/>pain increasing in this case has a particular musical effect - you may<br/>hear it as flipping from major to minor as the pain increases. Note<br/>how the other notes are biasing the perception of the detuned 4:5.<br/>Let&apos;s say you bring it to 19/16.<br/>From 2:4:5--:6-:7:9:11:13 to 2:4:5--:6:7:9:11:13 - bring the 6- back<br/>up to 6. Note the decrease in pain and/or depressingness.<br/>From 2:4:5--:6:7:9:11:13 to 2:4:5:6:7:9:11:13 - resolve the 5-- to 5.<br/>Pain gone, happy intense OHHHHHMMMM otonality. If this is still<br/>painful, decrease the volume of successive overtones to approximate a<br/>1/N rolloff or a 1/N^2 rolloff.</p><p>Hopefully that leaves nothing up to question. One last thing: If you<br/>start with 4:5:6, and you detune a combination of 7, 9, and 11, and<br/>13, you can :get a sonority that is equal in &quot;pain&quot; or sadness to<br/>minor. Perhaps 4:5:6: 7.65 :9: 11.55 : 13.6, or find nearby JI ratios<br/>if you can&apos;t stand the roughness. Something like 0-417-730-1133 too,<br/>perhaps.</p><p>&gt; Any kind of harmony can evoke musical feeling of some kind or another. All of us have always known this. What&apos;s your point?</p><p>Whoo, I can practically feel the contempt beaming at me through space.<br/>The point is that mixtures of concordance and discordance can lead to<br/>&quot;musical feeling of some kind or another,&quot; with mixtures of more<br/>concordance leading to &quot;some kind,&quot; and mixtures of more discordance<br/>leading to &quot;another.&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Detuned sonorites become &quot;minor&quot; assets, rather than unusable<br/>&gt; &gt; liabilities. Start playing with 13-tet and treat the sharp fifth as a<br/>&gt; &gt; pain-evoking &quot;minor&quot; fifth, and there&apos;s lots of cool stuff... Chords<br/>&gt; &gt; like 0 6 8 11 15 18, for instance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t even know what this means. Instead of treating the 8/13 octave interval as 738.5 cents, or an approximate 23/15, or anything else of that sort I treat as if someone was stabbing a pencil in my ear while I was listening to a fifth? How do I turn that into a compositional technique?</p><p>You treat it as a semi-augmented fifth which is slightly &quot;painful&quot; and<br/>add concordant overtones on top of it to stabilize it and transform it<br/>away from being so painful that it&apos;s a pencil being stabbed into your<br/>ear and into a level of painfulness comparable to &quot;minorness.&quot; One<br/>interval which is available in 13-tet for doing this is ~11/8. Try<br/>working in JI first - take this detuned fifth and then adding a just<br/>7/4, 9/8, 11/8, or whatever intervals you like until you hear the<br/>sound transform into something more palatable. Note the precise<br/>feeling created.</p><p>Then see what options are available to do similar things in 13-tet.<br/>Notes that are &quot;slightly out&quot; in 13-tet might slightly stabilize it,<br/>or make it more painful, depending on how out they are and how complex<br/>the base JI interval is.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=93107 href="#93107">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2010 6:09:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Sep 20, 2010 at 7:16 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Huh?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I mean is that C-E-G-B-D-F# does NOT necessarily<br/>&gt; approximate 1/1_5/4_3/2_15/8_9/4_45/8.

I&apos;m saying that both of them are perceived as<br/>divergent from 4:5:6:7:9:11, but not divergent enough to cause a new<br/>rooted or tonal sonority to develop; hence discordance, hence pain,<br/>hence &quot;sadness.&quot; C-E-G-B-D-F# is more divergent than 1/1 5/4 3/2 15/8<br/>9/4 45/8, and hence should be slightly more painful. 1/1 9/7 3/2 27/14<br/>9/4 81/28 should be even more so. And I personally hear a very<br/>significant transformation from rooted and slightly sad to more sad,<br/>longing, to even more sad and slightly painful, and beyond as I take<br/>1/1 - xx - 3/2 - xx - 9/4 - xx, start the xx&apos;s at 5/4, 15/8, and 45/16<br/>respectively, and start to sharpen them.</p><p>&gt; &gt; A way to turn this perceptual and mental distinction into<br/>&gt; &gt; something real, I think, would be to consider the difference<br/>&gt; &gt; in discordance between 4:6:7:9 and 3:6:7:9,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did suggest that. There isn&apos;t much difference in<br/>&gt; discordance. Technically the latter should be slightly more<br/>&gt; concordant, but because of rootedness the former is generally<br/>&gt; heard as more concordant.</p><p>Correct. Except I think that it&apos;s not so much rootedness specifically,<br/>but that you have to generalize HE for dyads to triads to tetrads in<br/>such a way that the concordance of different subtriads and such is<br/>taken into account. That being said, 3:6:7:9 is heard as matching<br/>1:2:xx:3. When you increase the xx slowly, you will eventually reach<br/>2:4:5:6. As you approach 2:4:5:6, you will pass through a region where<br/>it&apos;s &quot;almost&quot; 2:4:5:6, and yet it&apos;s not. It&apos;s on the border between<br/>distorted and harmonic, and inharmonic, so to speak.</p><p>So from a perceptual standpoint, this is the region of maximum<br/>discordance for tetradic entropy - it&apos;s right between placing it and<br/>giving up. And this causes perceptual pain for reasons I can only<br/>speculate about. So do this for 4:5:6, and detune the 5 to something<br/>like 11/9, or wherever you hear it as more discordant and painful.<br/>Then add 7, 9, and 11, and maybe 13, and see if it lessens the pain a<br/>bit. And then detune the overtones and cause more pain, etc. And then<br/>bring the 11/9 back into 5/4, or out a bit further to 6/5, to the<br/>point where it starts to &quot;give up&quot; more and perceive it as two<br/>separate sounds and maybe only try to place it &quot;a little bit,&quot; and the<br/>pain will abet slightly. Find something that you enjoy, and then find<br/>JI ratios nearby so that there&apos;s no roughness, and you will have a<br/>whole new variety of interesting and xenharmonic sounds to play with,<br/>of which the utonal sonorities are very close to a subset of (but of<br/>which there may be better &quot;minor&quot; options for higher limits).</p><p>So what I&apos;m saying is, if you really hate my theory and think I&apos;m<br/>totally off my rocker, at least just play around a bit with this and<br/>have some fun, and you will hopefully see the pattern. Start with 1/1<br/>- 6/5 - 3/2 - 12/7, which is the 7-limit utonality. It sounds sad.<br/>Increase the top one to 7/4, and it&apos;s less so, although the roughness<br/>might bum you out, so go to something like 9/5.

If tetradic entropy as formulated naively by just giving each<br/>tetrad a complexity of something like geomean(a*b*c*d) and assigning<br/>the incoming tetrad a generalized gaussian 4-dimensional probability<br/>curve, the point may not line up with this. If you generalize dyadic<br/>entropy to the four dimensional case another way, it may. Whichever<br/>way -does- line up with this is going to be the most effective way to<br/>generalize it, as by definition, it&apos;s going to pass the most listening<br/>tests.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So what I&apos;m saying is, if you really hate my theory and think<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m totally off my rocker,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can&apos;t figure it out, is all. Can you come up with a way<br/>&gt; to quantify it?</p><p>Harmonic entropy first represents a dyad as &quot;matching&quot; partially a set<br/>of basis dyads. The entropy equation comes entirely out of that. I am<br/>then going to investigate the representation of the set of all dyads<br/>&quot;matching&quot; an incoming dyad as the set of orthogonal (or<br/>non-orthogonal with an orthogonal subset, I haven&apos;t decided yet) basis<br/>functions for a theoretical vector space. Then I&apos;m going to try and<br/>turn this into a mathematical transform, which is how the Fourier<br/>transform already does things. The way HE does things is more similar<br/>to the Laplace transform from that perspective than the Fourier<br/>transform, so I&apos;m going to see what happens if I generalize the<br/>Laplace transform in order to incorporate a signal with harmonics.<br/>Given that HE has been so successful in predicting discordance from a<br/>purely information theory standpoint, I would expect that this<br/>approach will be at least equally successful. It may be that somewhere<br/>between the Laplace transform and the HE way of doing things lies the<br/>answer.</p><p>From this perspective, the distinction is that the Laplace transform<br/>uses basis functions which are exponentially damped sine waves (you<br/>can think of the Laplace transform as being a way to represent a<br/>signal in terms of basic components of damped harmonic motion rather<br/>than simple harmonic motion), and the HE fundamental calculation uses<br/>something more like sinc-damped sine waves. This is because each one<br/>is treated as having a &quot;reach&quot; in either direction that is total for<br/>its domain and then stops. This is equivalent to its domain being a<br/>rect function in the frequency domain with an amplitude of 1 and a<br/>width of sqrt(n*d) (actually in this &quot;dyadic&quot; domain that I hope to<br/>generalize in a more organic way), which is a sinc function in the<br/>time domain.</p><p>You will note that the characteristics of a sinc function and e^(-at)<br/>are very similar in terms of how they taper off over time. I would<br/>expect that the differences would be very small. The main distinction<br/>is that the use of the Laplace transform will give each dyad a domain<br/>that looks something like a Gaussian taper rather than a concrete<br/>&quot;domain,&quot; which I think makes more sense anyway. I don&apos;t think the<br/>entropy curve is going to see much of a difference; it may just<br/>increase slightly since everything will match slightly more dyads.</p><p>And then I&apos;m going to find the paper here<br/>(<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F7486%2F20359%2F00940605.pdf%3Farnumber%3D940605&authDecision=-203">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F7486%2F20359%2F00940605.pdf%3Farnumber%3D940605&authDecision=-203</a>)<br/>and see if I can steal a trick from their book and get the whole thing<br/>down to nlogn time, as they did with the FFT.</p><p>So that&apos;s how I&apos;m going to quantify it. I&apos;m going to see how accurate<br/>this is for n-adic entropy, and once I get it perfectly accurate, I&apos;m<br/>going to then see if there is a correlation between musical &quot;sadness&quot;<br/>and entropic discordance.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and you will hopefully see the pattern<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t do that on the stock market either.<br/>//<br/>&gt; You&apos;re writing too much, too fast.<br/>//<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve got to find a way to quantify it, then maybe we can test it.</p><p>Given that this recent outburst of excitement is a continuation of<br/>something I&apos;ve been working on for over a year, all of that is pretty<br/>insulting.
