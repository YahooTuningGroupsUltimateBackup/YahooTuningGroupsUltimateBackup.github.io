It&apos;s pricey at $60, but, in the first three pages he<br/>has you listen to five short CD tracks that are absolutely amazing!<br/>He comes up with a timbre that doesn&apos;t sound bad, but when you try to<br/>play intervals with it, you&apos;re &quot;forced&quot; into non-JI ratios.  It&apos;s a<br/>whole &apos;nother world!  And it&apos;s not even CLOSE to subtle: the dissonance<br/>of JI whaps you in the face!</p><p>Bill Sethares, my hat is off to you!!  I can&apos;t wait to hear the 10-tet<br/>pieces, performed with a voice specially chosen to work with this<br/>bizarre tuning!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
