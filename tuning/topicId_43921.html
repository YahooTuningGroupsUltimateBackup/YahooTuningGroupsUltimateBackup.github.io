It is on a come back now, getting in fact more and more established, leaving not much chances to experimental music and even less for microtonal alternatives, not to mention on new instruments. Trying to work<br/>myself as a microtonal composer in France, I can tell. And it&apos;s not the more recent so-called &quot;spectral&quot; movement that shows an improvement, as it should have, again.<br/>The only thing I&apos;m not certain is what is the real &quot;They&quot; you&apos;re talking about. I see more responsability in the institutions, culture and cities<br/>politics, establishment, than in the composers themselves. It&iuml;&iquest;&half;s true some of them became an institution themselves, but most escaped from that<br/>- also it&apos;s hard to say how each of us would behave if we were given that much power. I don&apos;t really see examples in the microtonal movement, but we never know... At least you do not seem to have that much compartimentalization and<br/>marginalization done by the institutions in the US. So keep on doing Microfests &quot;in every major cities&quot; like I red, and keep on opening the tuning doors, it&apos;s one of the best services you can do for the rest of humanity. And let us do one<br/>all together in the &quot;old europe&quot; some day, right ?</p></div>
