Imagine a chain of successive intervals like alternating 6/7s and 7/4s, lowering each consecutive tone by 1/7 of a syntonic comma, and reducing the result to a single octave range. What you get is essentially two 6-tone chains of 2/7-comma meantone, where one differs from the other by something close to 7/6 but not exactly that.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=83884 href="#83884">ðŸ”—</a>William Gard &#x3C;billygard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2009 10:43:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I definitely recognise a lot of septimal-minor thirds in this.

I don&apos;t remember hearing what sounded like a septimal-major (14:18:21)?</p><p>Did you use a certain scale tuning you came up with?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;Â™&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi tuners,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; about a week ago, I thought I had discovered a completely new temperament<br/>&gt; ...
