You should know that not all of the chords are<br/>really xenharmonic. The first two sets of chords are xenharmonic and<br/>shouldn&apos;t really be as intense as major/minor. It isn&apos;t otonal/utonal<br/>stuff that&apos;s going on though. The next set of chords should start with<br/>two non-xenharmonic chords that are just intoned nicely in JI - minor<br/>and minor maj7. Most people hear these chords as &quot;sad&quot; and &quot;more sad&quot;<br/>(or perhaps &quot;despair&quot;) respectively. It then adds a few more<br/>xenharmonic extensions that I hear as continuing the pattern of<br/>negativity and heighten the feeling - you don&apos;t hear these as more<br/>@#$*$# up than the last ones? And then I just try to slowly resolve it<br/>back into fully otonal to explore the range of moods in between.</p><p>I&apos;m really surprised about the last 3 - these aren&apos;t really too<br/>xenharmonic, just 12-tet chords that I&apos;m intoning a little bit<br/>differently. Most people I know hear major9#11 chords as sounding<br/>somewhat &quot;sad,&quot; or lydian mode in general having a bit of &quot;sadness&quot; to<br/>it...</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92965 href="#92965">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2010 2:27:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yeah, I had an experience like you suggested, but I also listened to it while reading your description.

The<br/>truth is that the examples worked for me, and I simply found a pattern<br/>that predicted when I&apos;d hear a chord as happy, sad, sinister,<br/>alarming, etc. I just posted it here to see if other people heard it<br/>the same way. To be honest, if everyone else heard it completely<br/>differently from me, then that would be real reason for me to assume<br/>that musical feeling emerges from cognitive aspects of the music,<br/>rather than psychoacoustics. There&apos;s plenty of room for cultural stuff<br/>even assuming the hypothesis I&apos;m making, though.</p><p>But I think you&apos;d have heard it somewhat similar if you were listening<br/>blind, especially the &quot;series of negativity part.&quot; I mean, just remove<br/>it from a musical context. If I hadn&apos;t told you to keep listening as<br/>it gets worse and worse, you might have just been like &quot;Damn it this<br/>is an irritating noise, Mike&apos;s examples suck, I need to turn this<br/>sound the hell off, beep beep boop organism must take action to remove<br/>painfully discordant intrusive stimulus.&quot;</p><p>Another Zen koan!</p><p>&gt; Though FWIW, the 7:9:11 major/minor examples definitely worked.

Should sound sadder. Now either flatten or sharpen the 7 by<br/>another 70 cents. Should sound even sadder. Add the 6 back in,<br/>shouldn&apos;t make much of a difference. Flatten the 6 by 70 cents, gets<br/>worse, etc. Note how consonance morphs into sadness morphs into fear<br/>and despair and eventually becomes<br/>fingernails-on-a-chalkboard-shut-that-damn-alarm-off bad.</p><p>Note 70 cents isn&apos;t a hard and fast rule; play by ear and find where<br/>the sound is most discordant. Introduce discordance in small,<br/>controlled, measured, predictable quantities, and you have<br/>&quot;minorness.&quot; I just detailed the space between &quot;minor&quot; and &quot;utter<br/>painful discordance.&quot; The space between &quot;minor&quot; and &quot;concordance,<br/>which sounds pretty cool&quot; I think is far more interesting to explore,<br/>however.</p><p>Also, once you detune one of the notes by this maximally discordant<br/>melodically optimal, you might choose to retune things into some JI<br/>near-equivalent to remove beating for cultural reasons; if you do<br/>this, you have effectively created a form of regular mapping in which<br/>this irrational, maximally discordant interval, is a &quot;prime&quot; that<br/>becomes &quot;tempered&quot; to align with the JI ratio of your choosing.</p><p>&gt; Also, what is the purpose in these listening examples of using such extended chords? Wouldn&apos;t it be more sensible to start by comparing the emotional qualities of triads first?</p><p>I don&apos;t think so. I simply tried to create an amount of discordance<br/>with each sonority, regardless of the human-imposed limit of how many<br/>notes are in a chord. I think there&apos;s a deeper principle at work here,<br/>which I have partially revealed above.</p><p>I&apos;m going to come up with a piece of counterpoint next that uses this<br/>as a compositional technique; I think it&apos;s instrumental in setting up<br/>something like &quot;tonality.&quot;</p><p>One last hint: 12-tet&apos;s 100 cent semitone functions pretty well as<br/>this &quot;maximally discordant interval.&quot; 13-tet from this perspective, is<br/>a bit better. Look at 13-tet from this perspective and note that every<br/>detuned JI ratio you see is a &quot;minor&quot; note, in a very, very abstract<br/>sense. 70 cents detuned from JI seems to be the peak of the &quot;pain&quot;<br/>that is introduced. You can add concordant intervals in order to undo<br/>some of this &quot;pain,&quot; if you create too much.</p><p>Have fun with it and see what you can come up with. Here&apos;s an<br/>interesting sonority that lies somewhere between &quot;classic minor&quot; and<br/>&quot;major&quot; on the &quot;pain&quot; spectrum, to my ears: 0 5 7 10 13 17 in 13-tet.<br/>There&apos;s a little bit of stimulative intrusiveness, I hear it as<br/>slightly &quot;unresolved&quot; (another zen koan) yet exciting, although<br/>slightly unsettled. My personal, subjective interpretation. From the<br/>perspective I outlined above, it&apos;s a detuned 4:5:6:7:8:10.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=93069 href="#93069">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2010 2:29:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/minortest.mp3">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/minortest.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first two chords you hear will be 4:7:8:10:11, then its<br/>&gt; &quot;minor&quot; version.<br/>&gt; After a few seconds of silence, you&apos;ll hear four more chords.<br/>&gt; First is the otonal 7:9:11.

I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll ever hear a triad as sounding<br/>&quot;equivalent&quot; to C-Eb-G in &quot;pain,&quot; and when you get to 7:9:11 and its<br/>detuned variant the difference is subtle. I also think that the<br/>distinction between triads and pentads breaks down on the<br/>psychoacoustic level that I&apos;m talking about.</p><p>If you want to stick to triads, I might be able to figure something<br/>out, but it&apos;ll have to wait until I get my head on straight with<br/>exactly how to best make predictions. It might have to wait until I<br/>calculate tetradic entropy, which I want to try and accomplish in my<br/>free time in the next few weeks. (You might actually find my approach<br/>somewhat interesting, as I think I can get it down to nlogn time for<br/>any amount of notes.).</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=93103 href="#93103">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2010 4:59:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I was gonna suggest to Mike &amp; Igs, that if we can agree on<br/>&gt; a set of chords to test, and Mike or Igs were willing to<br/>&gt; synthesize the examples, I am willing to buy Mechanical Turk<br/>&gt; time to get results and then maybe the three of us could<br/>&gt; put a paper together.</p><p>That&apos;s not a bad idea.
