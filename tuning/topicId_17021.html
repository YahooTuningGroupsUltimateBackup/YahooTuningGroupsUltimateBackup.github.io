If you<br/>see anyone trying to patent it in the future, remember you read it here<br/>first, in a public forum.</p><p>So you want to convert your standard 12-tET guitar to 5-limit JI, or<br/>meantone or whatever (so long as it has 12 notes per octave and doesn&apos;t<br/>differ too wildly from 12-tET). You wander down to your music store and<br/>select the appropriate packet of strings, come home and fit them, and away<br/>you go.</p><p>How could this magic be acheived?</p><p>By having unevenly ground strings. Strings whose diameter varies between<br/>frets.</p><p>Consider this standard 5-limit JI tuning</p><p>    C#  G#<br/>  A   E   B   F#<br/>F   C   G   D<br/>      Eb  Bb</p><p>Tune the open strings as E A D G B E on this lattice.</p><p>Consider that we want the first fret to change the pitch by different<br/>amounts for each string. We&apos;ll ignore the fact that pressing the string<br/>down increases the tension as well as shortening (decreasing the mass).</p><p>In 12-tET every string gets it&apos;s mass reduced by the 12th root of 2 which<br/>is approximately 16/17. In our JI tuning we will want the E D and B strings<br/>reduced by 15/16, the G string reduced by 24/25 and the A string reduced by<br/>25/27. So the part of the E D and B strings above the first fret would be<br/>slighly fatter so it represents 1/16 of the mass of the string instead of<br/>1/17, and the part of the G string above the first fret would be slightly<br/>narrower so it is only 1/25 of the mass of the string (about 18% smaller<br/>diameter).</p><p>Similarly we need the E and A strings to have 1/9 of their mass above the<br/>second fret while the D G and B strings have 1/10, and so on.</p><p>Now we just need to find someone to make these things!</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=17023 href="#17023">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/2000 7:44:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&quot;In 12-tET every string gets it&apos;s mass reduced by the 12th root of 2 which<br/>is approximately 16/17.

I think<br/>you&apos;d be hard pressed to make a significant frequency change just by<br/>tweaking the density of a fret-distance at the very end of a vibrating<br/>string.</p><p>(this could be easily verified by clamping a small fishing sinker to the<br/>middle of a guitar string, then successively closer to the bridge.  I do<br/>not have a guitar, or a sinker, but I&apos;m quite certain of the results.)</p><p>Also, I&apos;m pretty sure you&apos;d get nonharmonic partials as a result of such<br/>a trick, and they&apos;d be different for each note you played.  Perhaps<br/>interesting?  It&apos;d be fun to hear.</p><p>And, just to be a complete and total Captain Bringdown (sorry!), such<br/>a scheme would be extremely sensitive to a given guitar&apos;s string length,<br/>and each string would have to be carefully aligned - even quite small<br/>absolute tuning changes could pull a string significantly off where it&apos;s<br/>supposed to align.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=17174 href="#17174">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2001 6:53:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Dave Keenan:]<br/>&gt;By what proportion would you have to increase the diameter of the<br/>&gt;string uniformly above the first fret in order to lower its pitch by<br/>&gt;29 cents (the difference between 25/24 and a 12-tET semitone)?</p><p>Good question!  Setting up the second order differential equation is<br/>easy enough, but solving it for nonlinear string density, I don&apos;t know<br/>how to do.  The ideal way to answer the question would be to model the<br/>string in a finite element program capable of dynamic analysis, which,<br/>unfortunately, I don&apos;t have access to at the moment.</p><p>Here&apos;s a wacky thought: could piano strings be made to have more<br/>harmonic overtones (offsetting the effect of string stiffness, at least<br/>partially) by careful invocation of nonlinear string density?  If so,<br/>would the result sound more pleasing, or less?  Has this ever been done?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
