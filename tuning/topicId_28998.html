In TR #1<br/>and Halloween, John Kirkpatrick had respelled many of Ives&apos;s notes to<br/>make them more &quot;practical&quot; and more &quot;correct&quot; harmonically.  The<br/>reason I spent so much time undoing all that foolishness wa to make<br/>these Old editions in line with our new Ives Society guidelines. (We<br/>now preseve Ives&apos;s spelling, rhythms, and have a consistent format for<br/>describing details of the editing.)</p><p>Ives himself states his thinking in an Appendix to his &quot;Memos&quot; --<br/>flats represent repose and rest, sharps represent activity.  I&apos;ve seen<br/>several places where a first draft uses flats, but the later and final<br/>drafts use sharps. C# is nearer to D than to C, etc., Db closer to C<br/>than to D.  Hence that descending &quot;triad&quot; in &quot;West London&quot; b-ab-e.<br/>The &quot;3rd&quot; ab should be flatter than a &quot;proper&quot; g#.&gt;&gt;</p><p>Now I wonder how many of these spellings, ones that could easily be<br/>&quot;fixed&quot; in a harmonic sense, were &quot;corrected&quot; in this way at one point<br/>or another... and just how common were schismatic triads were in Ives<br/>anyway?</p><p>Was this late thinking, early thinking, consistent thinking....<br/>isolated instances? Did he go even further along these lines?</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
