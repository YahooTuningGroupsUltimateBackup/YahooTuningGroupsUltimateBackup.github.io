I spent a lot of effort making these charts adaptable<br/>to many instruments and many tunings for people not only to learn the<br/>standard tunings but for experienced players to experiment with other<br/>tunings easily and quickly. If your interested then please visit the<br/>site at <a href="http://pages.eidosnet.co.uk/liamredmond/guitar/index.html">http://pages.eidosnet.co.uk/liamredmond/guitar/index.html</a> if<br/>the tuning or instrument you require is no listed then forms are<br/>provided to add new ones. I was surprised that not one of my 1000 or<br/>so visitors has yet requested any different tunings so I thought I&apos;de<br/>post a note here for people who are &apos;into&apos; alternate tunings.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Liam D. Redmond.</p></div>
