Usually the goal it to achieve, or at least<br/>approach, some form of Just Intonation (JI).</p><p>There are many types of adaptive tuning:</p><p>   . Fixed Adaptive Tuning (FAT) vs. Variable Adaptive Tuning (VAT).<br/>     See below for an explanation of this distinction.</p><p>   . Method of making tuning choices: performer vs. computer program.</p><p>   . Real-time adaptive tuning vs. &quot;leisure&quot; tuning, with the latter<br/>     able to make choices based on an entire work, and the former able<br/>     to see only the past and present.</p><p>   . The particular tuning targeted: 5-limit JI, 7-limit JI, etc.</p><p>   . Whether exact JI intervals are mandated, or whether, for the sake<br/>     of reducing the retuning of notes continuously sounding, intervals<br/>     may deviate somewhat from exact JI.</p><p>   . Whether &quot;drift&quot;, the tendency of the overall absolute tuning to<br/>     change progressively over time, is to be allowed, or is to be<br/>     forbidden.</p><p>FAT achieves adaptive tuning by making dynamic use of a fixed set of<br/>available pitches, almost always on a keyboard instrument.  The number<br/>of possible pitches is usually determined by the number of physical keys<br/>available to the player.  This has the advantage of giving the artist<br/>complete control over the adaptive tuning used, at the expense of<br/>limiting to some extent the range of what can be done.</p><p>A theoretical method for FAT was first proposed by Nicola Vicentino in<br/>1555.  One keyboard manual consists of 19 consecutive fifths tuned to<br/>1/4 comma meantone; the other corrects for flat meantone fifths (and<br/>minor thirds) by being tuned 1/4 syntonic comma (5.38 cents) higher.<br/>For more information, see [Margo&apos;s entry].</p><p>VAT means that there is a continuous gradation of possible tunings for<br/>a given pitch.  VAT can be produced by some acoustic instruments, by the<br/>human voice, and by many electronic instruments.  Barbershop singing<br/>makes heavy use of VAT, and to some extent, so do jazz and blues singing<br/>and playing.  More recently, there have been experiments with retuning<br/>programs that apply VAT to MIDI files.</p><p>The challenges of adaptive tuning are easily illustrated: consider the<br/>sequence C-&gt;A-&gt;D-&gt;G-&gt;C, either with bare notes or with the chords Cmaj,<br/>Amin, Dmin, Gmaj, Cmaj.  The ideal tunings for the four sequential<br/>intervals are 5:6, 4:3, 4:3, 4:3, but the product of these, corrected<br/>for octave, is 80:81, the famous (or infamous) syntonic comma.  One way<br/>to deal with this challenge is to let the absolute tuning &quot;drift&quot; over<br/>time, in this case downward by about 1/5 semitone each time the sequence<br/>is played.  Over the course of a reasonably long piece, drift of this<br/>sort can easily amount to a large fraction of an octave, if not more.<br/>There is a school (&quot;Strict JI&quot;) which accepts such drift in order never<br/>to compromise simultaneous intervals or retune sounding notes.  If drift<br/>is considered unacceptable, however, then difficult choices have to be<br/>made, at least in modifying the tuning of notes which are continuously<br/>sounding, and (optionally) in compromising to some extent the tuning of<br/>intervals.</p><p>Real-time adaptive tuning by program is superior to leisure tuning in<br/>that one need not wait for the results: as a piece is played, it is<br/>tuned.  However, since chord transitions often involve a several<br/>milliseconds of overlap, not to mention slight arpeggiation of the new<br/>chord, a real-time program can easily become confused and make bad<br/>choices that have to be corrected with painful motion of notes already<br/>sounding.  This difficulty is particularly intense when tuning targets<br/>7 or higher limits, in which tuning deviations are much greater than in<br/>5-limit music.</p><p>At least one commercial program is available for real-time VAT (see link<br/>below), and at least one list member has dabbled in leisure VAT of MIDI<br/>files.  The field of adaptive tuning is still in its infancy, however,<br/>and many refinements have yet to be made.  Also, there is a great deal<br/>of controversy regarding what target adaptive tunings (if any) are<br/>suitable, or appropriate, for works of past masters.</p><p>For further information:</p><p>   Commercial real-time adaptive tuning:</p><p>      <a href="http://www.justonic.com/">http://www.justonic.com/</a></p><p>   Experimental leisure adaptive tuning:</p><p>      <a href="http://www.adaptune.com">http://www.adaptune.com</a></p><p>   A real-time, computer controlled FAT piano:</p><p>      <a href="http://tigger.cc.wmich.edu/~code/groven/">http://tigger.cc.wmich.edu/~code/groven/</a></p></div><h3><a id=19337 href="#19337">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>2/23/2001 2:30:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are many types of adaptive tuning:<br/>&gt;<br/>It appears here that what you mean is &quot;there are many choices one has<br/>to make in approaching adaptive tuning&quot;, since what follows is not<br/>actually a list of distinct types of adaptive tuning but rather a<br/>list of concurrent dichotomies.
