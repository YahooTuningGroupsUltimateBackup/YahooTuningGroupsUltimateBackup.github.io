As for *why* it is, this is my guess:<br/>- With cents error, if you make one key closer to JI some<br/>other key goes farther away from JI, but the two can cancel.<br/>It is, in other words, possible to have a well temperament<br/>without any of what George S. calls &quot;harmonic waste&quot; (I think<br/>that was you, George).<br/>- But the way harmonic entropy is scaled, they don&apos;t cancel,<br/>and if you consider all keys entropy tells you your best bet<br/>is equal.  This would apparently be supported by the historical<br/>move towards equal temperament as music used more and more<br/>modulation.  But some present-day listeners do seem to prefer<br/>the effect of some inequality even when using all keys.  I<br/>once heard Jerry Kuderna play Op.110, which is in Ab, at point-<br/>blank range in a tuning with a wolf fifth on Ab.  I would<br/>have preferred ET in such a case, but apparently Jerry did not.</p><p>Anyway, that&apos;s just a guess - I haven&apos;t really looked at the<br/>math.

The whole n/x2 family, ie harmonic overtones, for example,<br/>can wolf down big primes with no signs of indigestion.</p><p>Anyway, &quot;you know what I mean&quot;: if intervals do have recognizable<br/>character by virtue of rational properties, whatever or however many<br/>factors go into the making of that character, doesn&apos;t it stand to<br/>reason that, for example, a relatively simple interval which shares<br/>properties with a rational &quot;target&quot; interval and is 3 cents from<br/>that target, is going to better &quot;represent&quot; that target than an<br/>irrational interval two cents away? Better than &quot;represent&quot;, it<br/>could even be a &quot;better&quot; interval.</p><p>I&apos;ve mentioned several times that I work with &quot;regions&quot;, but I don&apos;t<br/>mean that anything goes within those regions, or that the<br/>theoretical center of the region is the goal. What I mean is, those<br/>intervals of the same musical family which fall in that region &quot;go&quot;.</p><p>George Secor&apos;s 17WT wasn&apos;t made thinking this way, as far as I can<br/>tell from his writings, but it audibly fulfills the criterion. I<br/>think it clear as to why- the two &quot;fifths&quot; he chose are<br/>simply &quot;right&quot;, and can probably be reproduced as two<br/>somehow-related ratios, or irrational proportions within a<br/>don&apos;t-be-silly distance of those ratios. So even though he<br/>says &quot;better/worse keys&quot;, I hear only different keys; in other<br/>words, I haven&apos;t heard a tone which is crying out for a split key<br/>because it&apos;s a sad attempt at being something else rather than what<br/>it literally IS.</p><p>&gt;   Appropriateness is also very subjective.</p><p>Yes indeed- 12-EDO seems an insane choice for a band that plays the<br/>same 3 chords in the same key for 30 years, for example, hahaha!<br/>They could hone that key to custom perfection and dump every comma,<br/>llama and wolf-o-rama anywhere else, and the same thing is true to<br/>different degrees for anyone else who isn&apos;t doing Giant Steps or<br/>Elektra.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway the whole business of considering everything as<br/>&gt; &gt; an &raquo;approximation&laquo; of a handful of just intervals is bogus- an<br/>&gt; &gt; interval should be good in and of itself,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t agree.
