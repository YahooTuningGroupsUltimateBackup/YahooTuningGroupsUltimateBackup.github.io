Two distinct kinds of<br/>&gt;&gt; tones are not being assumed. Unless you assume two semitones must make<br/>&gt;&gt; up a tone, which historically one cannot do, we are left with meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you are reading into it something which is not there. Can you<br/>&gt; provide an independent reference for your terms &quot;major tone&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;minor tone&quot;? On this side of the Atlantic a &apos;tone&apos; is a class of<br/>&gt; interval equal to two successive semitones.</p><p>Having grown up on the same side of the Atlantic as the poster, let me<br/>reassure the rest of the group that the English--with the quoted writer an<br/>exception--are as aware as the North Americans, the contintental Europeans<br/>and everyone else here, that until very recently C-D and D-E were not<br/>intended to be the same distance apart. Even as recently as the turn of<br/>the century Bruckner learnt this from his composition teacher, who taught<br/>that D-A wasn&apos;t as good a fifth as the others because it contained two<br/>minor tones, and had to be &quot;resolved&quot; like a dissonance! It&apos;s not a &quot;side<br/>of the Atlantic&quot; thing, it&apos;s a &quot;how ignorant you are or aren&apos;t&quot;. And for<br/>crying out loud, don&apos;t assume that because you haven&apos;t heard of something<br/>or it doesn&apos;t appear in the &quot;Oxford Companion to Music&quot;, that someone here<br/>just made it up. Get a real reference, or look into something online<br/>before accusing someone else of sophistry when they are by far your<br/>superior in these matters.</p><p>For my part, a much more direct irritant than any crackpot beliefs<br/>expounded offsite is this poster&apos;s assumption, based on ignorance, that no<br/>one else here has got a clue! I&apos;ve never seen anything quite like it.</p><p>--Jon Wild</p></div>
