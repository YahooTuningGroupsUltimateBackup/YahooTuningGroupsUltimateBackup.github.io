Perhaps it<br/>is something to do with using the wave samples well outside the<br/>natural range of the instrument sampled.</p><p>Here is a new version of the glock. oboe, this time using 14 partials<br/>and they are measured more accurately using a wave of about 10 seconds<br/>duration to find the partials, and cut off at MIDI note 103.</p><p><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/glock_oboe_v5_max_103.mid">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/glock_oboe_v5_max_103.mid</a><br/>Hopefully this will sound okay - let me know if it doesn&apos;t!</p><p>You will probably get the same effects in the<br/>comet fly by, whenever one of the planets reaches really high MIDI notes.</p><p>What one hears is the note itself, together with a<br/>lower note, which is often louder than the intended note.</p><p>When played fast, you get glissandi effects below the<br/>tune.</p><p>With the comet fly by, you may get rather attractive descending<br/>continuous and discrete glissandi towards the end</p><p>Then sometimes, you may get noise instead, as you say.</p><p>One doesn&apos;t often notice this, because most MIDI<br/>clips keep reasonably within the natural range of<br/>instruments.</p><p>For instance, default flute on my SB Live! soundcard is okay<br/>up to a&apos;&apos;&apos;. It first gets a quiet undertone note at b&apos;&apos;&apos; flat (E7, 106),<br/>but that note is basically okay. From c&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; upwards it plays all<br/>sorts of pitches and undertones, but the basic pitch is still there<br/>above them, though often much quieter, until MIDI note 113.</p><p>Piccolo has first quiet undertone at f&apos;&apos;&apos; (F7, 101).</p><p>The recorder is okay up to g&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; (G8, 115)&apos;.</p><p>Koto has first quiet undertone at d&apos;&apos;&apos; (D7, 98),<br/>and plays all sorts of under notes after that - and I have often<br/>noticed this effect when playing fractal tunes high on the koto voice.<br/>Actually can be rather pleasant.</p><p>Glockenspiel is okay up to 110.</p><p>My non wave table synth on the soundcard plays okay up to<br/>a certain point, then just cuts off altogether.</p><p>Presumably the designer of the soundfont has to make<br/>decisions about this, and I would be interested to hear more<br/>about how it works.</p><p>Re the Slendro Alit mode:</p><p>According to the SCALA mode list, Slendro Alit is an<br/>unequal four tone mode of Pelog:</p><p>degrees<br/>[2] 1 1 2 3  Slendro Alit</p><p>However the modes list of FTS has it as<br/>1 1 2 3  Slendro Alit</p><p>Sorry about that. It would have happened when I auto sorted<br/>all the modes lists according to numbers of notes and<br/>variation in step size, and must be a bug in that auto sort<br/>causing it to leave out the [n] at start of mode.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to fix the auto sort, and FTS modes lists, and so<br/>thanks very much for pin-pointing this bug.</p><p>However, it may also sound Pelog like in &quot;atmosphere&quot; because of the widely<br/>varying step sizes, since Pelog is an unequal seven tone scale,<br/>and this is a _very_ unequal four note scale.</p><p>With the Pelog scale I&apos;m using, this mode has steps:<br/>237  154  352  457</p><p>Here is a typical slendro scale:<br/>slendro_pliat.scl | Gender wayang from Pliatan, South Bali (Slendro), 1/1=305.5 Hz<br/>steps: 235.4  218.1  251.2  222.7  272.5</p><p>To within 20 cents<br/>     8/7~  8/7~    7/6~   8/7~  7/6~<br/> -4.245 -13.03  -15.64 -8.507 5.676</p><p>Most of the Slendro scales in the SCALA archive have roughly<br/>equal steps of around 8/7 or 7/6 (though one of them<br/>has a step of 156 cents)</p><p>These are the other modes of Pelog in the SCALA mode names<br/>list that have Slendro in the name:</p><p>[1] 1 1 2 1 2      Patet Barang with Pelog, Manangis, Slendro Gede, Pergenter 2<br/>[2] 1 1 2 3                Slendro Alit<br/> [4] 2 1 2 1 1             Slendro 1<br/> [1] 2 1 2 1 1             Slendro 3<br/> [3] 2 1 2 1 1              Slendro 4</p><p>The actual Pelog scale used was this one from SCALA:</p><p>pelog1.scl | Gamelan Saih pitu from Ksatria, Den Pasar (South Bali). 1/1=312.5 Hz<br/>1/1 153 cents 315 cents 552 cents 706 cents 848 cents 1058 cents 2/1</p><p>Anyway, I think there are some gamelan experts on the TL, so over to them.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/9/2001 6:59:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/18465">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/18465</a></p><p>&gt;<br/><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/glock_oboe_v5_max_103.mi">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/fts/glock_oboe_v5_max_103.mi</a><br/>d<br/>&gt; Hopefully this will sound okay - let me know if it doesn&apos;t!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Just as a continuation of this discussion, as most people probably<br/>know, patch editors generally have a &quot;morph&quot; function that will<br/>create similar kinds of effects, although not as systematically.

My feeling is that<br/>you&apos;re safest recording high notes and bending them down.
