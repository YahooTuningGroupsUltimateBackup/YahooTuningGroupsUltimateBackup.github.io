If he can&apos;t get his Jadassohn out and check it up, then<br/>it really isn&apos;t nice music etc. etc. &quot;He puts notes in a chord that<br/>don&apos;t belong in it--and he usually has too many notes--he doesn&apos;t<br/>understand harmony--for instance, on page three, there is a B# and B<br/>in the same chord{7}--that is wrong&quot; (Grandma Prof. says).  It is not,<br/>you g-- d--- sap!--takin&apos; money for emasculating music and students.<br/>I suppose I should explain by footnotes for soft-feeted, for those who<br/>can&apos;t see or do anything unless they have been &quot;learned to&quot; nice in<br/>some music kindergarten for grown-ups in legs.  The twelve notes in a<br/>nice well-tuned piano are &quot;twelve notes&quot;--machine-made almost--but at<br/>present the best instrument, that is, the widest sound implement we<br/>have, for only one man to use.  But the mind, ear, and thought don&apos;t<br/>have to be always limited by the &quot;twelve&quot;--for a B# and a C are not<br/>the same--a B# may help the ear-mind get higher up the mountain than a<br/>C always.  It has another use, perhaps a more important [use] than a<br/>nice little guide in a resolution--it makes a chord, in some cases,<br/>more a help and incentive for the ear to say (nearer to) what it<br/>feels.  For instance, in the key of C, B going up to C, sometimes<br/>under certain moods, is sung (regardless of the piano) nearer to C<br/>than B on the piano--and, going down from C to B, farther away.  Now<br/>when the two B&apos;s are used in a chord, there is a practical, physical,<br/>acoustical difference (overtonal, vibrational beats) which make it a<br/>slightly different chord than the B&apos;s of an exact octave--and [even]<br/>on the piano the player sees that and feels that, it goes into the<br/>general spirit of the music--though on the piano this is missed by the<br/>unimaginative.</p><p>Some of the chords in this, but more often passages from the _Second<br/>String Quartet_ and some of the chamber sets--one I remember in pages<br/>3-6 of _The St. Gaudens_{8}--I copied out and had played by six<br/>violins at Tams, playing in a kind of chord-system made--that is,<br/>assuming that a Db was nearer down to C, and that a C# was nearer up<br/>to D.<br/>After the players had sensed this difference in playing the<br/>passage--say B-B#-C, D-Db-C (to remember the B# and C, and the D and<br/>Db etc.)--to me they usually sounded nearer to each other than a<br/>quarter-tone, though in the upper and lower movements I noticed very<br/>little difference.  Then [I] would try to have the player think and so<br/>play the Db as it had [been] played in going up to D, and then play<br/>with the others in a chord--and this had its own way [of being]<br/>different to the usual.</p><p>For instance, I don&apos;t remember this particular chord Prof. S. remarked<br/>on page 3--but a passage marked page 15 (see end of fourth brace)--in<br/>the left hand, two lower notes of the chords, a G goes up to Ab<br/>(though in the sketch marked G#){9}, and the B to Cb, and Cb to<br/>C,--the B (when played by strings) went up from B, and the Cb went<br/>almost to C.<br/>And when this passage is played on the piano, this difference can be<br/>sensed, if not actually heard--that&apos;s the piano maker&apos;s or tuner&apos;s<br/>fault, not the ear&apos;s.  That is, as the G goes to Ab, the B is sensed<br/>as going to Cb--in the strings the chord Ab-Cb-Gb-Bb{10} is a<br/>different<br/>chord from Ab-B-Gb-Bb (see typewritten copy sent to Bellamann of<br/>technical plan etc. of Sonata, with tone-vibration tables etc.)--the<br/>difference in its overtonal beats (actually measured vibrationally),<br/>especially if hit rather hard, is evident.</p><p>Thus, when a movement, perhaps only a section or passage, is not<br/>fundamentally based on a diatonic (and chromatic) tonality system, the<br/>marked notes (natural, sharp, or flat) should not be taken as<br/>literally representing those implied resolutions, because in this case<br/>the do *not* exist.  The eye mustn&apos;t guide or enslave the ear too much<br/>or entirely in all cases--any more than the hand should too readily<br/>(&quot;easily&quot; better word), by the ways of its anatomy, physiology, and<br/>its life, limited too much by custom and habit and bodily ease, should<br/>narrow (enslave?--soften?--dwarf?--emasculate?) pianoforte<br/>music--Zat&apos;s right, Rollo?

Ives, _Memos_, pp. 189-90)</p><p>________________<br/>{7} In the first line of p. 3.</p><p>{8} Measures 13-18 of _The St. Gaudens_ would seem to lend themselves<br/>particularly to this kind of experiment.

I am sure he means well and I hope<br/>to be clear about my position.  For Dan Stearns, I hope this holds up<br/>similarly to a math proof.</p><p>Perhaps it best to proceed in a list format (no pun intended).</p><p>1.  There are only 2 tunings (or pure tuning models) in Western art music:<br/>just intonation and the spiral of fiths.  These provide the conceptual models<br/>of intonation necessary to composing.  Temperaments are designed to get a<br/>combination effect, and to achieve modulation.  Temperaments tend to favor<br/>one tuning or another.</p><p>2.  In the spiral of fifths, a C# is higher than a Db.  In just intonation it<br/>is the reverse. Ives gives not a vague piece of minutiae, but the key to a<br/>puzzle that must have an answer (like a clef to a staff).  No one can compose<br/>music at the level of Ives and not have a specific intonational model for his<br/>imagination to develop in harmonies and melodies.</p><p>3.  While the piano was the most flexible instrument for the time Ives was<br/>composing, it need not be restrictive to new developments in both instrument<br/>design and playing technique.  Extended Pythagorean, the cycle of fifths<br/>through 2 octaves, gives the music of Ives a perspective otherwise lost.  I<br/>read Ives as being practical about the piano.  He is writing about thoughts<br/>on intonation that no one could (or has) previously picked up.  It took<br/>intense performances of Ives to apperceive his aesthetic.</p><p>4.  Both AFMM performances of the &quot;Universe Symphony&quot; and the &quot;Unanswered<br/>Question&quot; demonstrated the value of this tuning orientation in the<br/>performance.  The recent &quot;Unanswered Question&quot; had more universal approval<br/>than any other performance of any single piece of any single composer since<br/>the AFMM began in 1981.</p><p>5.  Ives pointing out that a B# is an eighthtone higher than a C has already<br/>been demonstrated on the tuning list as being perfectly appropriate to an<br/>Extended Pythagorean tuning and merely underscores the correctness of the key<br/>(C# is higher than Db).</p><p>6.  Ives, being sympathetic to different tunings through his father&apos;s legacy,<br/>was never  given the opportunity to tweak musicians to the subtleties of<br/>different tunings, other than the story in the Memos, recently posted.  Had<br/>he the chance, he would have taken it as seriously as he did his printed<br/>score notation.  His anger with Kirkpatrick changing the accidentals for a<br/>published score is legendary.</p><p>7.  Where 12-tone equal temperament is an impovement on the Extended<br/>Pythagorean, Ives would prefer it.  It is a symetrical tuning with its own<br/>qualities.  I have long believed all music to be microtonal, and can easily<br/>understand why Ives would sometimes use 12-TET for the passages that it does<br/>well.  However, Ives seems to indicate it is not for the majority of his<br/>music.</p><p>8.  The leading tone is an interesting idea, but I don&apos;t think it has<br/>anything to do with just intonation.  It is an exagerated linear stretching<br/>of a note, akin to the spiral of fifths melodic melodic foundation (left<br/>hemisphere).  This is contrary to the overtone series-dictated just<br/>intonation favored for harmonic considerations (right hemisphere).  Together,<br/>integrated through temperament, the 2 tuning models offer differed shades of<br/>the human condition as expressed through composition and theory.</p><p>9.  Extended Pythagorean is also the basis for Babylonian music, modern<br/>Turkish music, the music of Guillaume Machaut, and was calculated through<br/>many octaves on a monochord with an abacus long before Anaximander of Miletus<br/>wrote on infinity.</p><p>10. Believing Ives to be &quot;vague&quot; and &quot;incomplete&quot; is contrary to getting his<br/>work out and about.  Presently the AFMM is undertaking a new Ives project.<br/>We are re-recording the &quot;Universe Symphony&quot; which we did live in 1996 so that<br/>it can be commercially distributed.  Also the score has been entered into<br/>Finale, and we&apos;re working on a book spilling the details of its organization.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/><a href="mailto:afmmjr@aol.com">afmmjr@aol.com</a></p><p>p.s.

It&apos;s a letter written to composer Ingolf Dahl and Sol Babitz by<br/>Ives with the aid of his wife, Harmony (yes, that was her real name) about<br/>the 3rd Violin Sonata.  I will quote the relevant passages:</p><p>&quot;Babitz / Dahl</p><p>    &quot;I am.... He thanks you for your letter.....</p><p>    &quot;He is rather sorry that some flats and sharps have been changed into<br/>each other.  Mr. Ives usually had a reason technically, acoustically or<br/>otherwise, for using sharps and flats.  If a D-flat is in one part and<br/>C-sharp in another on the same time beat, it was mainly due to some<br/>acoustical plan--which he had in mind or was working out or trying to in<br/>those days.......</p><p>    &quot;But after the first page, whatever changes there are in accidentals<br/>(which he hopes are not many, especially in the 3rd movement) do not bother<br/>to put them back as the old copy.--Either way won&apos;t &apos;make or break&apos; the<br/>listener&apos;s ear.</p><p>                                        &quot;With our kindest wishes to you both<br/>                                            [signed Harmony T.

And again this would seem to be another<br/>perfect opportunity to substitute &quot;some acoustical plan--&quot; with<br/>something that would firmly express this more or less easily<br/>expressible (if it all really were simply a case of &apos;note spellings<br/>coincide with chains of 3/2s and 4/3s&apos;) technical particular.</p><p>&gt;It is _not_ for every note of his music, as when it is not tonal and<br/>then 12-TET,</p><p>I agree with the first part, but as far as the &quot;when it is not tonal<br/>and then 12-TET,&quot; I get nearly the opposite impression when I read &quot;in<br/>many cases the accidental mark (call [it] key index--though really not<br/>an accidental, [but] a sign for a different ratio of overtonal<br/>vibrations) is made to suggest and conform to the above theory--in<br/>other places so as not to bring to mind a tonality which does not<br/>exist, and so not [to] feel or think about not having a key. This is<br/>so it won&apos;t mislead the eye first, then as a result also the ear and<br/>the mind et al.&quot; It seems to me that he meant to (occasionally)<br/>subvert *tonal* expectations with these note spellings... &quot;So two<br/>notes standing alone a whole tone apart seem (to the nice classroom)<br/>to be a nice sign that they are a part of the dominant seventh, and<br/>must act obediently--but the ear sometimes doesn&apos;t feel exactly that<br/>way--so we must be fair and change that sign. Suppose two curves, an<br/>up and down, start on Eb and Db, and are held down hard through the<br/>arpeggios and back, and we don&apos;t land in Ab major--that sign isn&apos;t<br/>fair, Rollo, it points us the wrong way--so the sign-maker makes it C#<br/>and Eb, and the music via the ear takes its own way up the mountain<br/>better, and feels better about [it]. For instance, just as an<br/>illustration or instance [of] wrong signs made nearer right, or at<br/>least away from a misleading tendency-- see _Thoreau_, page 61, 2nd<br/>brace, chord [at] beginning of 6th quarter-note beat--this is L.H.:<br/>C#-F#-E,{16} R.H.: G#-F-Bb--if the right-hand G# had been put an Ab,<br/>the eye would probably, to most, have suggested a resolution to a nice<br/>Eb major tonic chord, even in spite of the C# in the left hand with F#<br/>and E over [it] which may seem to lead towards a B gate--but it<br/>doesn&apos;t get there,&quot; etc.</p><p>&gt;Once again the letter points out that the ideal intonation for Ives<br/>was not that of conventional 12-TET, though it was not far enough off<br/>to &quot;make or break&quot; the music.</p><p>I think I agree with this... But if I were to purely speculate for a<br/>moment, I&apos;d be tempted to say that &quot;some acoustical plan--which he had<br/>in mind or was working out or trying to in those days&quot; probably never<br/>went very far beyond just that... and that I&apos;d somehow doubt that he<br/>actually ever got to hear (literately not figuratively) and weigh his<br/>music in a full Pythagorean intonation... Some of the more tonal songs<br/>that have a later date might make for interesting study and debate<br/>along these lines. Take for example _The Collection_ (which is dated<br/>1920). The chromatics of the 4/2 intro would read very differently in<br/>twelve tone equal temperament and extended Pythagorean (and not<br/>necessarily for the worst in extended Pythagorean either), but it<br/>would also seem that the tonic triads (even with the third an octave<br/>above the root) that open (when the meter changes from 4/2 to 3/2)<br/>this quite conventional sounding tune would&apos;ve really stood out (yes,<br/>even more than they already do in twelve tone equal temperament!) were<br/>they taken in a Pythagorean intonation... and while I&apos;m ENTIRELY<br/>speculating here (which I&apos;d probably be best off NOT doing), I do<br/>think that all these sorts of issues would have to be (or rather<br/>should be) addressed by somebody before &quot;a smoking gun&quot; becomes a<br/>&apos;case closed!&apos;</p><p>&gt;And incidentally, just played the Oct. 11th AFMM performance of the<br/>Ives &quot;Unanswered Question&quot; for Peermusic which publishes the piece<br/>last Friday.

Now<br/>when the two B&apos;s are used in a chord, there is a practical, physical,<br/>acoustical difference (overtonal, vibrational beats) which make it a<br/>slightly different chord than the B&apos;s of an exact octave&quot;</p><p>&quot;in the strings the chord Ab-Cb-Gb-Bb is a different chord from<br/>Ab-B-Gb-Bb (see typewritten copy sent to Bellamann of technical plan<br/>etc. of Sonata, with tone-vibration tables etc.)--the difference in<br/>its overtonal beats (actually measured vibrationally), especially if<br/>hit rather hard, is evident.&quot;</p><p>As far as your points 1 and 2 go, I personally agree with most all of<br/>what your saying... but I think the point (as I see it anyway) here is<br/>that Ives never said, &quot;Pythagorean,&quot; or &apos;note spelling are such as to<br/>coincide with chains of 3/2s and 4/3s.&apos; And even though the<br/>opportunity seemed to present itself on numerous occasions, he never<br/>pressed this... he never saw it through the way he did say his use of<br/>quartertones - no troubling ambiguities there, he (and performances in<br/>his lifetime) saw the interest through...</p><p>Something along the lines of &apos;note spelling are such as to coincide<br/>with chains of 3/2s and 4/3s&apos; might very well be the evidentially<br/>soundest conclusion one can piece together from the evidence as it is<br/>(what he said, etc.); but I&apos;ve seen nothing to sway me from my<br/>original feeling that a wholesale recasting of Ives&apos; music into a<br/>Pythagorean intonational framework is over amplifying one particular,<br/>tantalizing evidential bit... And that this is viable creative<br/>decision of Johnny Reinhard based on what he has best deduced, rather<br/>than some clear historically languishing intonational directive of<br/>Ives himself.</p><p>To point 3, I really think that he clearly indicates in the _MEMOS_<br/>that these note spellings *were* used to bypass typical harmonic/tonal<br/>expectations and &quot;mental&quot; habits.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve added a chapter on Intonation and I am eager to work out these<br/>issues.</p><p>Have you had any kind of contact with say the &quot;Ives Society&quot; people,<br/>or Lou Harrison (who would really seem to have a unique perspective on<br/>this due to his first hand knowledge of Ives manuscript roughs and his<br/>own personal history of intonational interest), etc.?</p><p>Dan</p></div>
