My dear friend and musical colleague for over 35 years, Dean Drummond passed away this morning after a long illness. Composer/Performer/Instrument Builder, Co-Director of Newband and Director of the Harry Partch Institute, Dean leaves an incredible legacy. At our first meeting I was so struck by the sounds he created through the orchestration of percussion and flute that our friendship was instant. I hadn&apos;t heard anything like it before. This lead to the formation of &quot;Newband&quot; and the invention of the 31 tones per octave Zoomoozophone. Having performed with Harry Partch at the age of 17 Dean was eventually chosen by Danlee Mitchell to become the curator of the Harry Partch Instruments, which led to the formation of the Harry Partch Institute at Montclair University. I can&apos;t say enough about Dean&apos;s dedication to music, performance and education. I am honored to have been a part of his life and I will miss him. Rest In Peace Dean.</p></div><h3>bigAndrewM &#x3C;bigandrewm@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2013 9:22:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I saw the news.</p><p>Yet another influence that I&apos;ll never get to meet . . .</p><p>Andrew</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brofessor&quot; &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since i have did not notice any mention of this.
