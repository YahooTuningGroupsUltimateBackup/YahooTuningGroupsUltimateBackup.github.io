No place I<br/>contacted had any idea. Have you actually gotten a hold of any of<br/>these? (seel below as well)</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know how difficult, or easy,  it was to obtain copies of<br/>&gt; Partch manuscripts until now, but it&apos;s certainly good to sea that<br/>&gt; they become now *officially* available.</p><p>Before now they were essentially unavailable, having never been<br/>published. For many reasons! But there is a caveat:</p><p>A couple of people have seen preproduction proofs of the scores, and<br/>seeing that Schott didn&apos;t see fit to get any knowledgeable Partch<br/>scholar involved, there are apparantly numerous errors. These would<br/>be in the accompanying descriptions, instrumentation, etc, as the<br/>scores are simply reproductions of his manuscript.</p><p>As of yet, Schott has not answered any of the contacts regarding the<br/>errors, essentially ignoring any input, and may either not care or<br/>don&apos;t want to be bothered with accuracy.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/5/2001 3:30:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Wim Hoogewerf&quot; &lt;wim.hoogewerf@f...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/26683">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/26683</a></p><p>&gt; At the occasion of Partch&apos;s 100th Year of the birth, Schott has<br/>published a facsimile edition of his scores.
