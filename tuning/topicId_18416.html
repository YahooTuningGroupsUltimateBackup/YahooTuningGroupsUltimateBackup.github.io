The bassoon formants must vary a lot between registers, and the piano<br/>partials stretch by varying amounts depending on register / heaviness of the strings. For<br/>those two instruments, best solution may be to play them very high.</p><p>For the illusion to have the best chance of succeeding, one will need an instrument that<br/>sounds distinctive at a high pitch (so that it can be recognised using releatively few<br/>partials) and sounds fairly similar over a wide range of pitches.</p><p>If one goes back to your original idea which Joseph Pehrson was keen on doing (which I<br/>prob. had in mind), then ones looking for a harmonic, and an inharmonic instrument with<br/>those properties. Just to take an example out of many poss. in standard Midi patch  set,<br/>to give the idea, say, oboe and glockenspiel.</p><p>As for decaying partials, and partials fluctuating in pitch as the note proceeds - one<br/>could do that in MIDI too if one had the data for it, using pitch bends and the expression<br/>controller.</p><p>Even new partials entering in as the note proceeds might be possible, by starting them at<br/>the minimum expression controller value that one can switch notes on at with ones<br/>soundcard / synth, so one hopefully won&apos;t hear much attack. Then increase to the desired<br/>expression level for them.</p><p>One will already be playing each partial in a new channel for the pitch bends, so adding<br/>fluctuating pitches and expression is certainly possible.</p><p>In fact, I&apos;ll add it to the &quot;For the future&quot; list for FTS. Actually, it already has about<br/>as much on it as the FTS 1.09 beta has since the 1.082 release, so may be talking about a<br/>couple of releases from now for some of the options (or possibly a series of smaller<br/>releases instead).</p><p>That leaves the continuous component of the sound.</p><p>Here is a java applet of the necker cube in perspective, so if one can get it to flip, it<br/>looks really strange.<br/><a href="http://www.gifford.co.uk/~principia/Illusions/necker.htm">http://www.gifford.co.uk/~principia/Illusions/necker.htm</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=18434 href="#18434">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/7/2001 2:14:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18416.html#18416">/tuning/topicId_18416.html#18416</a></p><p>&gt; Here is a java applet of the necker cube in perspective, so if one<br/>can get it to flip, it looks really strange.<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.gifford.co.uk/~principia/Illusions/necker.htm">http://www.gifford.co.uk/~principia/Illusions/necker.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert</p><p>I really love these visuals...

I&apos;m talking about<br/>perception and awareness of stress here. You can play passages of Bach&apos;s cello or violin<br/>sonatas in rhythmically different ways so that the pattern pops up on or off the beat. For<br/>example the E major violin prelude or the arpeggio passage in the Chaconne. I would like to<br/>hear more about  how the visuals relate to harmony and tuning.</p></div><h3><a id=18538 href="#18538">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/10/2001 12:33:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_18416.html#18537">/tuning/topicId_18416.html#18537</a></p><p>&gt; I would like to<br/>&gt; hear more about  how the visuals relate to harmony and tuning.</p><p>Hello Alison!</p><p>Thank you for your commentary.  Frankly, I think there are more<br/>examples of this kind of Escher/Necker phenominon in music than one<br/>might initially suppose.  I think even something as simple as the<br/>multiple resolutions of a diminished-seventh chord in 12-tET<br/>(probably in some other systems also) would be a good example of this<br/>perceptual &quot;multiplicity.&quot;</p><p>I think you will see from the commentary that Robert Walker has<br/>something specific in mind, a kind of &quot;morphing&quot; effect of timbral<br/>change created by mixing the partials of one timbre with those of<br/>another and then fading the initial ones out... so that the<br/>resultant timbre changes before our very ears, so to speak.  I<br/>believe Robert is working on some further examples of this, so you<br/>should have something to hear shortly...</p><p>_______ _____ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
