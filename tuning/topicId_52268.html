Here hair cells<br/>detect the vibrations and send signals to the brain via the auditory<br/>nerve. One theory is that the brain works out pitch simply from the<br/>timing of signals from nerves, which varies depending on the frequency<br/>of a sound. Models based on this timing theory are currently in vogue.</p><p>The competing theory says that perceiving pitch depends on where in the<br/>cochlea nerve signals come from as well as the timing of nerve signals,<br/>based on the fact that different nerve cells detect different<br/>frequencies. The start of the cochlea picks up very high-frequency<br/>sounds, with more distant areas responding best to progressively lower<br/>frequencies.</p><p>A clever trick that fools a high-frequency area of the cochlea into<br/>producing low-frequency signals has now been used to test which theory<br/>is correct. The method involves using a high-frequency carrier wave to<br/>stimulate the part of the basilar membrane tuned to such vibrations.<br/>But the wave is broken into tight pulses to make the nerves fire as if<br/>hit by a low-frequency tone, an effect that is supported by as-yet<br/>unpublished experiments.</p><p>And in recent experiments with such &quot;transposed tones&quot; some groups have<br/>found that volunteers can determine the direction the tones came from,<br/>even when the carrier frequency is higher than the range within which<br/>we can detect the direction of a sound. This suggests transposed tones<br/>really do trigger nerve signals characteristic of a much lower<br/>frequency. The finding also shows that when it comes to detecting<br/>direction, it does not matter exactly where in the cochlea the signals<br/>originate, says Andrew Oxenham of the Massachusetts Institute of<br/>Technology. But what about determining pitch?</p><p>The MIT team asked volunteers to carry out a variety of tasks, such as<br/>determining the higher of two tones or tuning a note to match a<br/>reference tone. With pure tones the subjects performed very well. But<br/>with transposed tones their performance plummeted (Proceedings of the<br/>National Academy of Sciences, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0306958101). &quot;It was a complete mess,&quot; says Oxenham. The results are all the more surprising<br/>given that people say the transposed tones &quot;sound&quot; like low-frequency<br/>ones, albeit with a high buzzy background. &quot;Whatever they&apos;re hearing,<br/>the brain doesn&apos;t integrate it as pitch at all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The beauty of this is how cleanly it establishes that location plays a<br/>role in pitch perception,&quot; says Shihab Shamma of the University of<br/>Maryland, College Park. The work does not prove that location is all -<br/>both place and timing may play a role - but it should help focus<br/>attempts to define how the brain discriminates different pitches.</p><p>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a> (LucyScaleDevelopments)<br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to: <a href="http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/">http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.co.uk">http://www.lucytune.co.uk</a>  or <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2004 10:30:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Charles, sounds interesting . . .
