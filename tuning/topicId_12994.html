It isn&apos;t _my_ Golden Mediant. The purely mathematical result is Keenan<br/>Pepper&apos;s. Despite his claim (in private email) not to have seen the general<br/>result implied by his post &quot;The Other Noble Fifth&quot;,<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12592">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12592</a><br/>I think it is clear that he would have seen it eventually, whereas I would<br/>not in a million years have come up with a single one of his specific results.</p><p>It seems likely to me that this formula for the limit of these iterated<br/>mediants (these other &quot;noble numbers&quot;) has been published elsewhere. Has<br/>anyone seen it?</p><p>I&apos;d also like to give credit to Paul Erlich for supplying a piece of the<br/>puzzle when he wrote, on 16 Mar 1999, in TD 105.10, regarding 13:8:</p><p>&gt;It is very close to the Golden Ratio, and the golden ratio has<br/>&gt;fewer coinciding partials than any other ratio (for any given tolerance<br/>&gt;for what &quot;coinciding&quot; means, you have to go higher up in the partials of<br/>&gt;the Golden Ratio to find that degree of coincidence than you do for any<br/>&gt;other ratio).</p><p>2. My other objection to the title of this thread is that it is different<br/>from the title of the original post to which it relates, which is<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12915">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12915</a><br/>and appeared in TD 810.3.</p><p>Joseph, I wonder if you missed the explanation of &quot;why Phi&quot; because of this?</p><p>Margo, I assume you used the present title in the hope of connecting with<br/>those people following the very interesting harmonic entropy discussion.<br/>This is a laudable aim which I think has now been achieved.<br/>----------</p><p>So may I respectfully suggest that any future posts on this topic be posted<br/>under the heading<br/>&quot;Re: The Golden Mediant: Complex ratios and metastable intervals&quot;.</p><p>Future readers who come into this thread, will at least find this message<br/>directing them back to the original.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=12996 href="#12996">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2000 7:51:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan Stearns wrote [TD810.9]:</p><p>&gt;One quick point or question on a first read through... I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt;it&apos;s always clear that Golden Mediant algorithm and the mediant method<br/>&gt;are essentially asking opposite questions; in other words, I&apos;m seeing<br/>&gt;the Golden Mediant as a wonderful little closed-form shortcut to a<br/>&gt;sort of &quot;eventuality of mediant iterations.&quot;</p><p>Yes. That&apos;s precisely what Pepper&apos;s function gives us.</p><p>&gt;But isn&apos;t the mediant<br/>&gt;method in its usual application generally being asked to give the<br/>&gt;*least* complex (or most stable) point between two others, with only<br/>&gt;successive iterations eventually closing in on maximally complex zone?</p><p>Quite right. But we have to be careful here since mathematical complexity<br/>doesn&apos;t always correspond with subjective complexity.</p><p>&gt;It seemed as though all these points are nicely delineated at one<br/>&gt;point or another but perhaps not consistently clear -- maybe I should<br/>&gt;just read through it a few more times!</p><p>No. You&apos;re right, it isn&apos;t consistently delineated. This is because, once<br/>you get one or two iterations past any ratios that could possibly be simple<br/>enough to be attractors, there really isn&apos;t much difference between further<br/>mediants and the golden mediant from a psychoacoustic perspective. However,<br/>this may also represent a compromise of different emphases between authors.<br/>I&apos;m quite happy to ignore 14:11 and 23:18 as irrelevant and go straight to<br/>(5+9phi):(4+7phi), for example.</p><p>However it should be noted that nothing special is detected precisely at<br/>the golden mediant (at least _I_ can&apos;t detect it). The effect is very broad<br/>and quite unlike the &quot;locking-in&quot; of a precise simple ratio such as 5:4.</p><p>&gt;So, what do the significantly larger discrepancies between these two<br/>&gt;mediant methods mean (the 5/4 6/5 example for instance)? That the<br/>&gt;traditional mediant is a non trivial distance from the actual point of<br/>&gt;maximum complexity (i.e., the Golden Mediant)... that would be my<br/>&gt;take.</p><p>Yes. That&apos;s my take on it too. But in line with what I said above, one<br/>could also claim that 11:9 is a significant attractor.</p><p>&gt;Anyway, looking forward to reading it a few more times, and once<br/>&gt;again -- my compliments to the chefs!</p><p>Thanks for your kind words Dan.</p><p>I must say that working on this paper with Margo, in whatever spare time I<br/>could muster these past two weeks, has been a very enjoyable experience.<br/>She is such a wonderfully &quot;civilised&quot; person.

At the same time, I would agree with Dave Keenan that<br/>if we are simply trying to estimate the central region of maximum<br/>complexity or ambiguity, then the Golden Mediant might be an<br/>appealingly parsimonious technique.</p><p>Before I go on, I would just to like to thank Dave for his most<br/>gracious and insightful comments, and also to note that while my<br/>errant thread heading was indeed posted with the intention of making a<br/>connection with the ongoing &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; discussion, I have duly<br/>returned to the original thread title.</p><p>Let us celebrate the contributions of both authors of the &quot;two<br/>Keenans&quot; Golden Mediant function, Keenan Pepper and Dave Keenan, and<br/>also delve into the noble antecedents of this mathematical<br/>application, a most fitting theme which Dave&apos;s response has happily<br/>brought into focus.</p><p>As to the general plateau region between 5:4 and 9:7, and maybe<br/>specifically the part of the plateau between around Pythagorean and<br/>17-tet, I wonder if Dave and I are addressing two different questions:<br/>locating a cardinal landmark, the rough point of maximum complexity;<br/>and exploring the general area with its various shades of vertical<br/>and cadential color.</p><p>One task might be compared to surveying an area and finding its<br/>geographical center; the other to walking about it and getting to know<br/>its many attractions.</p><p>For the surveying approach, the Golden Mediant has the advantage of<br/>quick and ready rule of thumb, like finding the area under a curve<br/>simply by computing an antiderivate rather than by going through<br/>numerical integration with all of those rectangles or trapezoids or<br/>whatever.</p><p>For _exploring_ the area under that curve, so to speak -- or the area<br/>between Pythagorean and 17-tet or 22-tet or whatever, the Golden<br/>Mediant provides one very useful cardinal point of orientation, along<br/>with distances from clear &quot;valleys&quot; (here 5:4 and 9:7), and some other<br/>landmarks like familiar tunings (e.g. Pythagorean, 29-tet, 17-tet).</p><p>The Golden Mediant at around 422.487 cents suggests that the area of<br/>maximum complexity is right around 17-tet, and that Pythagorean is not<br/>quite 15 cents from it on the part of the plateau maybe a bit closer<br/>to 5:4 than to 9:7.</p><p>Note that a 23:18 or weighted intermediate at y:x=2 or (5+18):(4+14)<br/>is just a bit larger than a 17-tet major third, while the Pythagorean<br/>81:64 is at y:x=4/9 or (45+36:36+28). Thus if we&apos;re interested in the<br/>region between Pythagorean and 17-tet or the 23:18, we can try out any<br/>y:x values between around 4/9 and 2.</p><p>While walking through various integer values for x and y is one way to<br/>explore the plateau and come up with some intriguing intervals with<br/>large integer ratios, I&apos;d emphasize that intervals with irrational<br/>ratios are equal members of this continuum of beauty: for example, the<br/>charming major third of 29-tet.</p><p>As to 14:11 or (5+9):(4+7), the classic mediant, I would say that it<br/>is enough that this ratio appeals to the intellect (or at least to<br/>mine) while its sonorous realization is beautiful as one of many fine<br/>shadings of color offered by this general region.</p><p>Whether 14:11 is tuneable by ear or recognizable as a &quot;primary color,&quot;<br/>so to speak, is a question on which I am undecided, although Dave&apos;s<br/>answer is in the negative based on experiment, and I would be curious<br/>about the experiences of others.</p><p>In any event, however, I would say that an interval or tuning need not<br/>be tuneable by ear to be of interest; it may represent a subtle<br/>shading on the continuum with musical appeal, and that is sufficient<br/>reason to tune and enjoy it.</p><p>Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone, for example, is known as a temperament<br/>quite difficult to tune by ear, as Zarlino himself suggested (in 1571,<br/>if I am correct) at least by comparison to 1/4-comma with pure major<br/>thirds. There is evidently no special &quot;locking-in&quot; or other defining<br/>aural event when a major or minor third is precisely 1/7 syntonic<br/>comma from pure, as happens in this tuning.</p><p>Yet the tuning is esteemed, and Mark Lindley not too long ago authored<br/>an article espousing it as an ideal temperament for some of the organ<br/>pieces of Andrea Gabrieli, for example, featuring modes with an<br/>emphasis on the arithmetic division of the fifth with minor third<br/>below and major third above. This is getting into the &quot;modern&quot; side of<br/>my repertory, but the point is that the historical meantone continuum<br/>features many temperaments which represent fine gradients or mixtures<br/>rather than the simplest primary colors, so to speak.</p><p>Similarly, a neo-Gothic tuning featuring major thirds at or close to<br/>14:11 is at once giving sonorous form to a noble ratio -- and I<br/>emphasize the equal nobility of the 29-tet major third and others with<br/>irrational ratios -- and letting us experience one shade or hue of the<br/>xenharmonic rainbow.</p><p>In some ways, maybe, a question of at least equal interest to the<br/>&quot;tuneability by ear&quot; of a ratio such as 14:11 might be the general<br/>discrimination of the ear in distinguishing between these shadings.<br/>For example, can people easily distinguish between 29-tet, and a<br/>regular tuning with pure 14:11&apos;s, and 17-tet, etc.? How about shades<br/>of 5-limit meantone, for that matter?</p><p>In musical practice, of course, a 14:11 does not occur in isolation:<br/>it has associated with it in a neo-Gothic context, for example, a<br/>certain distance of expansion to a stable fifth (around 285 cents or a<br/>bit more, roughly the size of a 33:28 or 13:11), a diatonic semitone<br/>of around 80 cents, a chromatic semitone or apotome of around 130<br/>cents, etc.</p><p>All of these factors give flavor to the musical &quot;vintage&quot; of the<br/>interval, so to speak. Just how fine the aural distinctions are which<br/>can be made by listeners remains an open question.</p><p>As someone, maybe Paul Erlich, once commented, intervals with complex<br/>integer ratios such as the typical unstable sonorities of Pythagorean<br/>tuning have a quality akin to that of tempered intervals. Thus from my<br/>point of view, the traditional 81:64 and likewise 19:15, 14:11, 23:18,<br/>as well as the neighboring major thirds of 29-tet and 17-tet, etc.,<br/>are all part of the rainbow.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=13244 href="#13244">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2000 7:32:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13225">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13225</a></p><p>&gt; Joseph Pehrson wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The objections are nonsense.

Maybe we really _are_ the same person!</p><p>Please let me add to your remarks in a previous article that I<br/>sometimes refer to the Noble Mediant as the &quot;two Keenans&quot; function, or<br/>maybe even the &quot;Keenan-squared&quot; function, to suggest the power of<br/>sharing and cooperation of the kind which can happen in a worldwide<br/>community such as this one.</p><p>Also, thank you very much for some comments which may serve to<br/>illustrate some nuances of emphasis regarding the Noble Mediant<br/>and plateau regions of complexity generally. As you remarked in an<br/>earlier post (TD 813:25), there can be &quot;different emphases&quot; in how one<br/>approaches such regions, coupled with a hearty consensus that<br/>complexity can be a &quot;beauty mark&quot; rather than a &quot;defect&quot; (as you<br/>observed in another article).</p><p>Please let me begin by affirming our very strong area of agreement:</p><p>&gt; I think the main message of that paper is that we often mistakenly<br/>&gt; assume that what we want in a temperament is simply to minimise the<br/>&gt; dissonance of certain intervals by minimising their distance from JI<br/>&gt; (i.e. simple integer ratios).</p><p>Indeed this is what I see as the main message of our paper also: a<br/>Pythagorean third in medieval European polyphony is a beautiful and<br/>complex interval, not an &quot;out-of-tune&quot; version of a 4:5 or some other<br/>simpler ratio.</p><p>Complexity does not have to be an &quot;error,&quot; it can be precisely what is<br/>aesthetically ideal.</p><p>&gt; But Pythagorean and neoGothic major thirds are not trying to be 4:5,<br/>&gt; or 7:9 or even 11:14 or 18:23. They want to _maximise_ their<br/>&gt; dissonance. They are trying to be (4+7phi):(5+9phi).</p><p>Here we come to the matter of our somewhat &quot;different emphases,&quot;<br/>different variations on our common theme that &quot;complexity is<br/>beautiful&quot; in the right musical context. It might be curious to<br/>consider how much this difference is one of theoretical inclinations<br/>or actual musical perception.</p><p>As I see it, the Noble Mediant is indeed a cardinal landmark in<br/>exploring a plateau such as that between 4:5 and 7:9, and the distance<br/>of an interval from that &quot;geodesic center&quot; of the plateau becomes a<br/>very helpful reference in navigating the area.</p><p>Thus having identified the Noble Mediant for 4:5 and 7:9 as around<br/>422.487 cents, we can place the Pythagorean 81:64 as a bit less than<br/>15 cents on the slope of the plateau a bit closer to 4:5, and the<br/>major third of 17-tet (~423.53 cents) or the slightly larger 23:18<br/>at very close to the central Noble Mediant.</p><p>A 14:11 at ~417.51 cents, whether or not as the Classic Mediant<br/>(5+9):(4+7) it might represent any kind of &quot;microdell&quot; in the terrain,<br/>is situated about 5 cents from the center of the plateau, and thus<br/>might have a slightly different &quot;flavor&quot; of complexity.[1]</p><p>As an advocate of equal opportunity for intervals with irrational<br/>ratios also, I would add that the 29-tET major third at ~413.79 cents,<br/>for example, is a tad less than 9 cents from the Noble Mediant,<br/>suggesting yet another subtly different shade of color or flavor.</p><p>In other words, I might suggest that we may be dealing with shades<br/>analogous to those of temperament in the traditional sense, each shade<br/>having its own place of beauty and honor on the continuum.</p><p>Please note a distinction I have made in writing some of the above<br/>ratios: 4:5 and 7:9, for example, but 81:64 and 14:11. Writing an<br/>interval as a frequency ratio with the terms in ascending order, the<br/>convention you eloquently advocate, may intimate an aurally<br/>recognizable &quot;locking-in&quot; of the partials, etc.</p><p>Writing a ratio such as 81:64 or 14:11 in the traditional medieval<br/>fashion as a string ratio, in contrast, may avoid such implications,<br/>while identifying a ratio which an &quot;attractant&quot; to the intellect and a<br/>pleasure to the ear, whether tuned by measuring the proportions of<br/>strings or by defining a synthesizer table.</p><p>While certainly accepting the Noble Mediant as a cardinal reference<br/>point, I would say that a 14:11 wants to be a 14:11, a 23:18 a 23:18,<br/>and likewise a major third of 10/29 octave wants to be 10/29 octave.<br/>They may all have a certain family resemblance, and very fine<br/>distinctions along the plateau may be recognized more by the intellect<br/>than by the senses; I celebrate the richness of the continuum.</p><p>Curiously, after hearing a neo-Gothic improvisation in more or less<br/>14th-century style using a tuning with pure 14:11 thirds (a poetic figure<br/>of speech? -- and please note that I wrote &quot;14:11&quot; rather than &quot;11:14&quot;), a<br/>friend compared this kind of tuning to my penchant for geometric or<br/>typographical designs featuring complexly nuanced shades of gray. Choosing<br/>a 14:11 seems a bit like choosing 14% gray for a background or for one<br/>side of a polyhedron -- not necessarily a primary color, but a pleasant<br/>number which may have a beautiful visual effect.</p><p>Please let me also duly note that when encountering a new large<br/>integer ratio such as 33:26, my natural next step is to determine its<br/>size in cents (here ~412.75 cents, or about a cent smaller than in<br/>29-tET), and to place it on the continuum in reference to familiar<br/>landmarks such as other intervals or tunings -- and also, now, the<br/>Noble Mediant. The expression &quot;33:26&quot; serves as an auspicious _name_<br/>for this location at once unique and closely akin to its immediate<br/>surroundings.</p><p>Maybe there is a certain &quot;local patriotism&quot; involved here, as well as<br/>a neo-medieval passion for the lore of large integer ratios: each<br/>millimeter of the plateau, so to speak, has its own place.</p><p>Your comments raise a wider philosophical question, maybe applying a<br/>bit more dramatically to certain meantone tunings near attractants<br/>such as 4:5 and 5:6 than to fine neo-Gothic distinctions in the<br/>gently sloping highlands between Pythagorean and 17-tET.</p><p>Might we say that all meantone major and minor thirds, for example,<br/>want to be 4:5 or 5:6; or might the thirds of Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma<br/>temperament be exactly the right size in the right musical context?<br/>Mark Lindley, for example, has suggested that the contrast between the<br/>pure 4:5 and the somewhat &quot;beatful&quot; 5:6 in 1/4-comma meantone may give<br/>a very pleasing variety to certain passages in parallel thirds.</p><p>Having offered these odd remarks, I would like to express appreciation<br/>above all both for our common affirmation of the musical value of<br/>complex intervals, and for this precious opportunity to exchange<br/>viewpoints with such an exponent of mathematics, musical sensitivity,<br/>and respect and empathy treasured beyond words.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. If one applies the definitional test discussed in recent posts by<br/>Paul Erlich and others, then 14:11 or (5+9):(4+7) meets what I might<br/>call the cross-product test that (9*4)-(7*5) = 1. However, I would<br/>regard the question of &quot;aural recognizability&quot; as one to be decided by<br/>experiment, and Dave Keenan at least has tried this experiment and<br/>reached a negative conclusion under usual timbral conditions.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=13291 href="#13291">ðŸ”—</a>M.
