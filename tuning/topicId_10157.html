But<br/>unfortunately, they aren&apos;t particularly cheap even if you use the retailers<br/>in Europe. It kind of surprises me how the price of the K2000 holds very<br/>steadfast, despite being in production for how long (the original non-VP<br/>K2000&apos;s differ only by the presets)?

It basically utilizes the lowest most MIDI notes (0-11) for<br/>the purpose of changing the &quot;reference key&quot; in a given scale without<br/>altering the transposition (jeez, I would hope so). While, this is all very<br/>convenient and cool, the K150 is limited to octave scaling (fixated at<br/>twelve note scales, but 650 +/- cents for each note in that scale) and also<br/>somewhat of a hassle to create voices for using the Apple II for what most<br/>people care. I do not know if the K1000/1000 or any of the other Kurzweil<br/>synthesizers have implemented this since, maybe worth checking into. The DKI<br/>Synergy to my knowledge may also provide this facility.</p><p>Microtuning is often an afterthought as you know, and I am not sure<br/>manufacturers really grasp the detail of alternative scales to begin with<br/>(nor do most people I think). So, it doesn&apos;t surprise me that X or Y synth<br/>is advertised on some level as &quot;microtonal capable&quot; when really it doesn&apos;t<br/>provide much more than rudimentary modification of preset octave-based<br/>scales and so forth.<br/>&gt; [Arthur Green]<br/>&gt;&gt; Fatar makes some so-so controller keyboards, but if you have some<br/>&gt;&gt; money to spend, I would eye a used 76 or 88 controller keyboard<br/>&gt;&gt; (Yamaha, Peavey, Oberheim, and Kurzweil all made one).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; May I ask why you prefer these to the Fatars?  Fatar actually makes<br/>&gt; the actions for Peavey and Kurzweil keyboards.  I don&apos;t know about<br/>&gt; Oberheim.  Yamaha does their own, last I heard...<br/>&gt;<br/>My preference for the other brands listed is primarily the degree of control<br/>they provide the user, as opposed to anything to do with the action or<br/>&quot;feel&quot;. Kurzweil used to do business with Pratt-Reed and Hammond-Suzuki for<br/>their older keyboards (especially the latter when PR was having some<br/>&quot;difficulties&quot;).</p><p>Oberheim produced the MC2000 and the MC3000, which all in all, seem to be<br/>rather decent controllers (especially the latter). But, I doubt that<br/>Oberheim produced their own action as well, so it may very well be Fatar or<br/>some Japanese brand.</p><p>Now that I think of it, Doepfer seems to produce some half-decent<br/>controllers, too. Ditto on the action, though.</p><p>&gt; While Fatar&apos;s MIDI controllers impress me as being rather poor musical<br/>&gt; instruments, they are some of the best on the market, IMO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Speculating: it strikes me as odd that while the musicality of most<br/>&gt; instruments, guitar, flute, violin, etc., is sought after almost to<br/>&gt; the point of absurdity, it seems nearly absent in the pursuit of<br/>&gt; electronic keyboards.

Or are both conditions<br/>&gt; caused by the way a person playing keyboard doesn&apos;t look cool on stage?<br/>&gt; Consider what Keith Emerson had to do to gain notoriety...<br/>While, the Silicon-Valley &quot;guys&quot; and the netheads would like to say<br/>otherwise, I think we are dealing with a very conservative and<br/>backward-looking society (since the 90&apos;s especially). Not merely with<br/>musical instruments either, as even pop music, which I think often<br/>represents the focus of the general public, has looked to swing among other<br/>things.</p><p>But consider the electronic instrument, since the days it left the<br/>avant-garde &quot;so to speak&quot;, it has led a very problematic life against a very<br/>conservative public. Wendy Carlos had mentioned regarding her first<br/>&quot;Switched-On Bach&quot; recording that at first, the album&apos;s title credits were<br/>given to the &quot;Moog Synthesizer&quot;. Even since then, the public&apos;s image of the<br/>synthesizer hasn&apos;t really changed all that much from the days of the &quot;album<br/>that was played by the machine&quot;. It seems clear to me that the public AND<br/>the record industry still really have no idea what a synthesizer really is<br/>beyond what has been persued to the &quot;point of absurdity&quot;.</p><p>Even regarding synthesis, this too seems like an afterthought sometimes. I<br/>can sort of understand why the retro analogue crowds would throw sticks at<br/>the digital world, when the primary use of digital technology is to roughly<br/>obtain or surpass the &quot;apparent&quot; performance of the equivalent analogue<br/>technology for a fraction of the cost. So in their defense, if the only<br/>example they saw of digitals were corner cut &quot;budget&quot; machines, I can see<br/>why they might be a little leary of digital machines to say the least .<br/>Although, I still can&apos;t rationalize this since there have been a very<br/>adequate quantity of good examples as well, in my opinion.</p><p>Of course, the real reason for &quot;corner-cutting&quot; I think is cost. In my<br/>opinion, it is not really possible to make an instrument with the necessary<br/>power and produce an instrument of good to high quality, and hope to confine<br/>to some limit of affordability. On top of that, most keyboards that provided<br/>that power and precision that many us need or would enjoy immensely have<br/>proven quite literally to be market bombs, as the<br/>understanding/comprehension and required time to &quot;master&quot; such instruments<br/>far exceeds the general public&apos;s limits of tolerance (which generally seems<br/>to be too small for comfort at times for us who want to see more of what<br/>electronic instruments have to offer).</p><p>As far as the electronic instrument in live performance, it&apos;s the effect of<br/>the keyboard on a very conservative public. Most people&apos;s comprehension of<br/>the synthesizer is that it somehow makes the player&apos;s life easier, and that<br/>it does not require the same kind of level of musicianship to play good<br/>music on a synthesizer as it does on a conventional instrument. The public&apos;s<br/>comprehension is that the keyboard cannot produce musically interesting<br/>results that cannot be obtained by the &quot;real thing&quot;, and that electronics<br/>merely produce funny noises and mock imitations of &quot;real instruments&quot;.</p><p>If you consider &quot;sought after almost to the point of absurdity&quot;, if may be<br/>also something to consider that maybe even most MUSICIANS don&apos;t really know<br/>what a synthesizer is.</p><p>[speaking of electronic instruments in live performance, take a look at<br/>&apos;<a href="http://www.electronic-mall.com/heavenbound">http://www.electronic-mall.com/heavenbound</a>&apos; when you have the chance.

In response to someone&apos;s query as<br/>to why the K2000 has pretty much kept its market price the answer is<br/>simple: they&apos;re the only mass producer of electronic instruments that I<br/>know of that have truly kept the promise of future software updates not<br/>rendering a particular model obsolete. They&apos;re really good at this.</p><p>The other half of my gear is Korg. David Beardsley is correct in<br/>recommending the X5. I picked up 2 of these rack mounts for a song at<br/>Sam Ash last year. They&apos;re probably cheaper now if they&apos;re still around.<br/>The only drawback is that they have only one user definable tuning.<br/>Still, its how I got my start and highly recommend it. A great module<br/>for scales of twelve or less pitches.</p><p> I&apos;ve had my Trinity for 3 years now and it has held up excellently,<br/>especially when one considers it gets moved around a lot. I also have<br/>the Triton which is my favorite to use, even over the Kurzweils, because<br/>of its ease of use.</p><p>I especially like the Triton because of its multitimbrality and the fact<br/>that each of the 16 programs can have its own tuning. So, even though<br/>each key only goes up or down 100 cents, programs, when use in<br/>combination and each in their own tuning and MIDI channel, can pretty<br/>much produce whatever scale one wants. This can also be aided octave<br/>shifting where, even though each hand is playing in different physical<br/>octaves, the sound produced would be within the same. Also great for<br/>quasi-bariolage FX.</p><p>When working with a computer, I&apos;ve had success in working more visually<br/>in that I like to assign different pitches to different MIDI channels<br/>(which read as staves in my programs) in order to better sort out what<br/>is going on sonically.</p></div>
