However, a pre-antibiotic afternoon at the dentist left him without any teeth and in ruinous health.  Darreg&apos;s plans to study were given up.</p><p>  So, pulling one tooth may lead to mistakes, but pulling all of them will either (a) make you a microtonalist or (b) keep you from becoming a 12-toner.</p></div>
