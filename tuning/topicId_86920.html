Disjunct tetrachords divided for a resulting diatonic octave scale? That&apos;s a &quot;classic&quot; scale structure, in a real way, like, &quot;a very large part of the world&apos;s music for the last several thousand years has used this same basic structure&quot;.</p><p>And it sounded really nice harmonically and melodically, not to mention it had stuff like some downright traditional alternate cadences, vii&deg;-i, IV-i on the original tonic for example. IMO you shouldn&apos;t dump it yet, though I&apos;d recommend dropping the third a couple of cents, to 63/52 (mirror image of the 13/7, 3/2 the mirror).</p><p>I think it be a shame to simply abandon a scale with a unique flavor for no real reason.</p><p>--- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@ ...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Try this</p><p>&gt; 1/1</p><p>&gt; 10/9</p><p>&gt; 16/13</p><p>&gt; 4/3</p><p>&gt; 3/2</p><p>&gt; 5/3</p><p>&gt; 13/7</p><p>&gt; 2/1 (period)</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;     I optimized this scale to improve purity for chords that extend between two octaves trying to approach the strong bass-line possibilities that exist in scales like deca-tonic scales and those formed from &quot;circles of intervals&quot;.  The more I played around with that idea the more I realized you were right and my &quot;tempered&quot; Ptolemy Homalon scale needed some tweaking.</p><p>&gt;    The scale did gain a tad of critical band roughness due to slightly decreased ratios between dyads, but gained a lot of periodicity due to ratios like 16/13 and 13/7 tempering closely between just pure intervals and doing so better across octaves (IMVHO) than the original 11/6.and 11/9 they replace.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;    Kalle and others, what do you think of this scale and what do you see as its still-standing weaknesses so far as compositional flexibility?</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; -Michael</p><p>&gt;</p></div>
