The doubt was about a possible translation into<br/>modern terms of the original contract&apos;s text.<br/>The phrase &quot;la tersa del fa delle f&quot; is pretty obscure, and I believe<br/>Lindley&apos;s translation &quot;the minor third above F&quot; may be somehow<br/>erroneous, considering that the literal translation is &quot;the third of the<br/>&apos;fa&apos; of the f&apos;s&quot;, then there is no mention to the &quot;minor&quot; term.</p><p>I would propose a solution that would both make more consistent the<br/>explication of the antique text, and allow to determine the second split key.<br/>The word &quot;fa&quot; might be a misspelling of the transcriptor who rendered<br/>the antique text, which, instead, may be was &quot;la tersa del # delle f&quot;.</p><p>Such an error is more understandable if we consider that the antique<br/>document was written by hand with the characters of the XV century, then<br/>there is place, to the reader, for a confusion between &quot;#&quot; and &quot;fa&quot;. It<br/>may even be that the error was made by the copyst of the time; in fact,<br/>it is known that the contracts were written by a notary, and than copied<br/>by an assistant in the number of copies which was needed, according to<br/>the number of contractors. It may well be that the copyst had some<br/>difficulties in understanding the meaning of the unusual &quot;#&quot; character,<br/>and rendered it by the nearer common letters.</p><p>If we accept such an interpretation, the text becomes quite clear, as<br/>the English translation would be &quot;the third of the # of the f&apos;s&quot;, which<br/>is explicative with no forcing, so the second split key would be the<br/>A#/Bb, as already suggested by L. F. Tagliavini.<br/>It would be nice to check the original manuscript, if it is still<br/>available somewhere.</p><p>I launch this as just a working hypothesis, and would like to hear your comments.</p><p>Best regards from Italy<br/>Leonardo Perretti</p></div>
