Perhaps Joe or Dave thought it<br/>&gt;wasn&apos;t too important? I&apos;m OK with that. There are many more graphs to<br/>&gt;come.</p><p>It was there all along as<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Erlich/hentropy2.gif">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Erlich/hentropy2.gif</a><br/>just not included in Monz&apos;s html file.</p><p>I&apos;ve included it now, although it wasn&apos;t important.</p><p>The &apos;.gif&apos;s being changed to lowercase was probably what foiled John Starret.</p><p>&gt;Anyhow, the second to last line of the page, and the third to last line<br/>&gt;of the last indented segment, should say numerator + denominator &lt; N,<br/>&gt;instead of numerator + denominator &lt; 2N, since the graph that says &quot;Mann<br/>&gt;series N=112&quot; was defined that way.</p><p>Ok. I changed this.</p><p>&gt;I notice that my page [at John Starret&apos;s site] still links to the old<br/>tuning digest posts,<br/>&gt;without Joe&apos;s commentary and without the graphs. I like that, but maybe<br/>&gt;the two versions of the page should be linked to one another?</p><p>I&apos;ll leave that to you (Paul) to sort out with Joe and John. I&apos;m just<br/>temporarily hosting this stuff until Joe can get ftp access to his site<br/>again. I&apos;d prefer to just receive web-ready file sets from Joe in future.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div>
