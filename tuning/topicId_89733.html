I think this was not the case.<br/>What I said in full was :</p><p>&quot;If a tuning integrates one or more loops between several notes (is it<br/>the case here ?), or even equal divisions of a comma, the fact that<br/>it can be modelized through very high numbers seems to me as a very<br/>relative indication of the &quot;meaning&quot; of the tuning.<br/>The only thing we can presume is that Bach was not using such complex<br/>ratios - but was he using numbers at all ?<br/>He could have use some advanced loop techniques and yet without the<br/>need to calculate any ratio.<br/>On the other hand, if a temperament can be modeled correctly with<br/>relatively low numbers it is an indication of possibly simple equal<br/>or proportional beating, and therefore tuning-by-ear techniques.<br/>The only thing we can say, apart from all other considerations, is<br/>that Lehman does not demonstrates it.&quot;</p><p>Lehman (from what I understood) performs tuning-by-ear himself perfectly and without any calculations yes, but does not explains his tuning by the means of a JI-beating model.<br/>I am a luthier and I would have been interested to know if he had one.<br/>But no problem !<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div>
