The keyboard<br/>works were, however, definitely composed for a temperament of some sort, but<br/>he also has wonderful music composed for ensembles of instruments with<br/>flexible intonation and without keyboard and it would interesting to<br/>investigate in some detail whether his harmonic practice took this into<br/>consideration or not.</p><p>Regarding his disavowal of the piano as a composing tool, if you are able to<br/>imagine sounds well enough to compose directly to score, then having an<br/>instrument around is often just an invitation to try everything out, which<br/>slows one done considerably.  In University, I had some teachers who swore,<br/>often invoking Stravinsky, that not a note should be written down until<br/>played or sung, while others believed that music had to be internalized, and<br/>still others thought that writing was an exercise in necessary abstraction.<br/>Schubert was by all accounts fabulously fast at getting things down on paper.<br/>He had, after all, only 28 years to do it.</p><p>Neither Rossini not Wagner played piano with any virtuosity and Berlioz did<br/>not play piano at all -- in fact, he played guitar, flageolet, and flute.<br/>Shall we soon expect N-tet guitar arrangements of _Les Troyens_, the<br/>_Symphonie Fantastique_, _Harald in Italy_, and the _Requiem_?</p></div>
