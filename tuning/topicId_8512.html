You&apos;ve got to cut this out, man. I really<br/>can&apos;t afford the time to stay here much past our solving the high third<br/>mystery. If you keep this up, I&apos;ll be more hooked than I already am. So<br/>please cut it out!!! LOL<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I&quot;m beginning to suspect that this &quot;problem&quot; is grounded in theorists (and<br/>&gt;&gt;perhaps microtonalists, as well) intent on providing a rational system of<br/>&gt;&gt;fixed pitches that relate directly to a tonal center.</p><p>Paul:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even in the fixed-pitch interpretation of the diatonic scale that Monz gave,<br/>&gt; the D-A fifth is 27:40, and the D-F minor third is 27:32. Clearly this is an<br/>&gt; example of what you are talking about. There had to be a way to sidestep<br/>&gt; this problem on Renaissance and Baroque (and later!) keyboard instruments<br/>&gt; (necessarily of fixed pitch); the solution was meantone temperament.<br/>&gt; Unfortunately for Jerry, meantone temperament has very dissonant dominant<br/>&gt; seventh chord. During the meantone period, a keyboard continuo was quite<br/>&gt; common and it is doubtful that many vocalists would have made the ~35-cent<br/>&gt; change necessary to make 4:5:6:7 dominant seventh chords. But I guess we&apos;ll<br/>&gt; never know for sure.</p><p>Of course, you are right. But also consider that vocal composition was<br/>primary until well into the seventeenth century. Ears were relatively free<br/>to seek satisfying pitch relations. (I&apos;ll mp3 a great recording of a<br/>Gabrielli polychoral motet that was not likely to have been &quot;corrupted&quot; by<br/>meantone interference. Unfortunately, it was not recorded circa 1610. :-)</p><p>Renaissance singers had little &quot;interference&quot; from keyboards since the only<br/>instruments that were used _with_ singing were somewhat flexible in<br/>tuning--viols (if they weren&apos;t fretted) and recorders. Then violins hit the<br/>scene and took over the responsibility for &quot;ear&quot; tuning.</p><p>Also, consider that harpsichords (like pianos) produce a decaying sound,<br/>making it possible for well-tuned singing and string playing to maintain<br/>well-tuned performances in spite of theoretical dissonances.</p><p>Me:</p><p>&gt;&gt;Interest in allowing<br/>&gt;&gt;for &quot;scale step&quot; deviations to accommodate root changes seems minimal, and<br/>&gt;&gt;appears to result in compromised intervals having high-number ratios.</p><p>Paul:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The type of theory you&apos;re describing here is one that I&apos;ve always lashed out<br/>&gt; against.</p><p>Have I found a new soul mate? LOL</p><p>&gt; You&apos;ll find a lot of theorists doing that sort of thing, including<br/>&gt; Yasser of all people, but those high-number ratios are almost always<br/>&gt; irrelevant.</p><p>(?)</p><p>&gt; The adaptive tuning algorithms John deLaubenfels has been<br/>&gt; implementing and I and others have been discussing aim to tune almost all<br/>&gt; simultaneities in simple-integer ratios; each &quot;scale step&quot; will fluctuate<br/>&gt; over the course of the piece, &gt; though John&apos;s program tries to keep sudden,<br/>&gt; drastic changes (which would be disturbing in performance) to a minimum.</p><p>I dig it!</p><p>&gt; Meanwhile, John Link and others seems to like sudden, drastic changes,<br/>&gt; particularly in scale step 2 in the major scale, but in my opinion they&apos;re<br/>&gt; clinging too strongly to an essentially fixed-pitch interpretation like the<br/>&gt; one Monz gave (augmented with an additional &quot;D&quot; at 10/9 to make a consonant<br/>&gt; D minor triad).</p><p>Perhaps &quot;John Link and others&quot; will respond to this. It should be<br/>informative.</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;To me, the functional &quot;augmented fourth&quot; in a dominant 7th chord is _not<br/>&gt;&gt;synonymous with &quot;tritone.&quot; The former is larger and specifically has the<br/>&gt;&gt;leading tone on top and the latter is the keyboard&apos;s compromised ambiguous<br/>&gt;&gt;version of both &quot;inversions.&quot;</p><p>Paul:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Tritone&quot; literally means three tones,</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; or three major seconds,</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; or an<br/>&gt; augmented fourth.</p><p>No.</p><p>The term &quot;tritone&quot; could only be spawned by a 12-tET keyboard concept of<br/>music. In fact, the concepts of &quot;whole step&quot; and &quot;half step&quot; requires a<br/>keyboard mentality for validity. In keyboard terms, both &quot;augmented fourth&quot;<br/>and &quot;diminished fifth&quot; are (uuuuuughhhhhhgggggg!!!!!!!) &quot;tritones.&quot; Keyboard<br/>tritones are invertible. Acoustic &quot;tritones&quot; are not.</p><p>In response to an earlier post, I said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Why not 600 cents? Aren&apos;t we talking keyboard here?</p><p>Paul:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ellis was one of the &quot;high-number ratio&quot; people we both take issue with. His<br/>&gt; 590 cents is the 45:32. For practical purposes, the keyboard tuning would<br/>&gt; indeed be relevant -- as it happens, one variety of meantone, 1/6-comma<br/>&gt; meantone, has exactly this 590-cent augmented fourth.</p><p>Okay. There&apos;s that meantone business again. Can be bury meantone? I guess<br/>not, since we really should honor the past. On the other hand we bury our<br/>fathers. I&apos;m really confused on this. LOL<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;In any case, is 7 cents<br/>&gt;&gt;considered &quot;quite close&quot;? The difference between a keyboard &quot;tritone&quot; and an<br/>&gt;&gt;acoustic 5:7 diminished fifth or 7:10 augmented fourth is aurally quite<br/>&gt;&gt;considerable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are meantone tunings, though, where the augmented fourth would<br/>&gt; coincide with Jerry&apos;s &quot;diminished fifth&quot;; namely, 583 cents. Most of the<br/>&gt; historical meantone tunings come closer to this than 1/6-comma meantone.</p><p>Excuse me if I say &quot;So what.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Sounds like a whopping difference. I&apos;ll go with the one that best describes<br/>&gt;&gt;what ears hear. It appears to me that the 5-limit concept is simply a<br/>&gt;&gt;compromised apology to 12-tET tradition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 5-limit concept is much older than 12-tET tradition. The 5-limit<br/>&gt; concept, combined with the consensus ears of musicians, brought about the<br/>&gt; adoption of meantone tuning in the late 15th century. The dominant seventh<br/>&gt; chord was born in this 5-limit, meantone environment. In that environment,<br/>&gt; it was the augmented sixth chord, not the dominant seventh chord, that<br/>&gt; approximated the 4:5:6:7 chord. In fact, if you look at the historical<br/>&gt; literature, you&apos;ll find people discussing ratios of 7 in the context of<br/>&gt; augmented sixth chords and on their own merits long before ratios of 7 were<br/>&gt; ever discussed in the context of dominant seventh chords. And this wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; the result of any over-abstract theory -- Tartini could play the ratios of 7<br/>&gt; on his violin (we know because he reported hearing the then-unknown<br/>&gt; difference tones in the correct places) and yet considered these ratios to<br/>&gt; be foreign (in a good way!) to diatonic music rather than part of an<br/>&gt; already-existing practice involving dominant seventh chords.</p><p>This paragraph makes me want to live another 65 years so I can catch up to<br/>Paul. How old are you, Paul? 130? Do you have a day job? What do you do<br/>every day other than pore over old manuscripts? No wife saying &quot;why don&apos;t<br/>you spend more time with me&quot;? No time clock to punch? No stacks of exam<br/>papers to grade?

This is<br/>&gt; exactly synonymous with &apos;augmented 4th&apos; in Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>The term &apos;tritone&apos; is *far* older than any 12-tET theory,<br/>and in fact probably predates keyboards too, which, remember,<br/>were not tuned even approximately in 12-tET until around 1500<br/>at the very earliest.</p><p>As far as I know, the Greeks did not use the term, and it<br/>developed with Latin theory c 1000 - waaaaaaay before 12-tET.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

Info from anyone more<br/>historically informed would be appreciated - maybe someone<br/>knows of a viol discussion list to which this post can<br/>be forwarded?</p><p>And you are correct to note that recorders were used and<br/>are not fixed pitch.</p><p>But keyboards were certainly a frequent part of the ensemble,<br/>and something you&apos;re really overlooking: lutes were ubiquitous<br/>during the Renaissance, and they were fixed-pitch but not<br/>meantone, tuned generally in something close to 12-tET and<br/>in at least one important case (Dowland) in a circulating or<br/>well-temperament:<br/><a href="http://interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm">http://interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm</a></p><p>&gt; [Jerry]<br/>&gt; Also, consider that harpsichords (like pianos) produce a<br/>&gt; decaying sound, making it possible for well-tuned singing<br/>&gt; and string playing to maintain well-tuned performances in<br/>&gt; spite of theoretical dissonances.</p><p>Good point.  To my mind, it&apos;s very likely that singers accompanied<br/>by a keyboard continuo could sing a note at the pitch given by<br/>the keyboard, then slide it upward or downward as the keyboard<br/>sound decays, to make it approach vertical JI better.</p><p>Ta da! - an adaptive JI stemming from meantone, as advocated<br/>by Paul Erlich. (see his many posts on this to John deLaubenfels)</p><p>And something that I think Jerry feels is natural but Paul<br/>might balk at is the ability of good singers to sing whatever<br/>damn pitch they want to, regardless of what&apos;s going on around<br/>them.  A great example is Robert Johnson&apos;s total disregard<br/>for the 12-tET pitches being produced by his guitar while<br/>he sings microtonal pitches all over the place:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm</a></p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
