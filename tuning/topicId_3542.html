These ratios do not have the same odd limit, nor the<br/>&gt;same prime limit, yet somehow they are related, and perhaps should<br/>therefore<br/>&gt;receive equal values in a consonance/dissonance measuring system.</p><p>Yes! The ratios have the same denominator, and in earlier discussions on<br/>this list, Daniel Wolf and I agreed that the size of the denominator is a<br/>good measure of the dissonance of simple just ratios. (clearly it doesn&apos;t<br/>work for ratios like 3001:2001).</p><p>I&apos;m assuming here that the ratios are always written with the numerator<br/>larger than the denominator.</p><p>I&apos;ve always justified odd-limit as follows: A composer would like to<br/>consider all octave extensions and inversions of an interval equivalent, so<br/>that he/she could think in an octave-equivalent fashion about the<br/>relationships between tones (clearly Partch was such a composer). Modern<br/>music theory often refers to a set of octave-equivalent ratios as an<br/>interval class or i. c. (e.g., in 12-tET minor third, major sixth, minor<br/>tenth, major thirteenth, etc. are all members of i. c. 3). If an interval<br/>has odd limit n, obviously all its octave extensions and inversions will<br/>have an odd limit of n. Less obviously, all of its octave inversions and<br/>extensions have a denominator n or less. So in a sense the odd limit<br/>measures the maximum possible dissonance of any octave-specific interval in<br/>an interval class. Since the entire interval class has the same odd limit,<br/>one can greatly simplify things, as Partch did with his One-Footed Bride, by<br/>simply associating a dissonance level with each interval class. The only<br/>exception Partch made was his finitely consonant &quot;foot&quot; at 2:1 vs. the<br/>apparently infinitely consonant 1:1; otherwise the graph is perfectly<br/>symmetrical about the half-octave. Again, the numbers can&apos;t get too high; as<br/>Dave Keenan and I discussed some time ago, around 13 or so the denominator<br/>rule, and thus the odd-limit measure of dissonance, starts to break down<br/>(which Partch was clearly aware of when he drew his One-Footed Bride! -- all<br/>odd limits above 13 are assigned to the same, lowest level of consonance),<br/>and of course by the time you get to 3001 it&apos;s totally gone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Each partial acts as a mini gliding sine wave and therefore manifests the<br/>&gt;roughness and beating phenomena as exhibited by pure sine tone dyads in the<br/>&gt;regions of 1/1 3/2 and 2/1. So, the composite interval consists of all the<br/>&gt;partials of the constituent tones interacting with each other (producing<br/>&gt;beating) dependent on where they &quot;intersect&quot; other partials, how close they<br/>&gt;are to the intersection, etc.  So - at the intersection: no dissonance,<br/>near<br/>&gt;the intersection (and, apparently, near the mean of the st partials)- high<br/>&gt;dissonance, at other points - ?.</p><p>That question is exactly what the graphs by Helmholtz, Kameoka&amp;Kuriagawa,<br/>and Sethares answer -- these researchers calculated the type of dissonance<br/>you describe for every possible interval (obviously, using some small<br/>increment) for some timbre and graphed the results.

It does not show<br/>dissonance at the 3:2 interval or even the 2:1 interval.<br/>In fact, the graph shows that dissonance has nearly approached<br/>zero by the time you reach the 2:1 interval.</p><p>   Actually, my analysis of the waveform produced by<br/>the gliding tone interacting with the steady tone indicates<br/>a different kind of envelope around the 3/2 and 2/1 intervals<br/>than what is present at the 1/1 interval.  The 1.(small)/1 interval<br/>shows the classic &quot;beating&quot; waveform, in which a high-frequency<br/>waveform is enveloped by a two sine waves that are offset<br/>in phase by 180 degrees.  The 3.(small)/2 and 2.(small)/1 intevals,<br/>on the other hand, consist of a high-frequency waveform enveloped<br/>by a shape consisting of the area outlined by _three_ sine<br/>waves, each offset by 120 degrees.  It&apos;s hard to explain<br/>in words, but the effect is not so much amplitude modulation<br/>as offset modulation (the amplitude of the envelope waveform<br/>appears constant, but the waveform moves up and down in<br/>a sinusoidal pattern.)  The frequency of the envelope waveform&apos;s<br/>oscillation is the same as the difference between the steady<br/>and gliding waveform (at the 3/2 interval), but is double that<br/>frequency at the 2/1 interval.</p><p>   So the audible effect does not precisely sound like &quot;beating&quot;<br/>in the typical sense of the word.  However, there is definitely<br/>a periodic change in the quality of the sound that is hard to<br/>describe.  When the period of this change is within a certain<br/>range, the effect is a &quot;dissonance&quot;, similar to the effect heard<br/>when two nearly unison tones are added, but not exactly the same.</p><p>   Although I can also hear other stuff going on at other intervals,<br/>none of it is visible in the resulting displayed waveform.  The<br/>only intervals that have visually interpretable phenomena are 1:1,<br/>3:2, and 2:1.  These are also the only intervals around which I<br/>hear sounds that I can objectively call &quot;dissonance&quot;.  The other<br/>stuff that I hear is interesting, but not clearly dissonant.</p><p>Tim Crews<br/><a href="mailto:timcrews@home.com">timcrews@home.com</a></p><p>&gt; Helmholtz&apos;s curve shows how the individual partials behave in exactly the<br/>&gt; way I observed on the spectrogram:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; GT Partial                 intersections up to octave<br/>&gt; &gt;1                              1/1                                  2/1<br/>&gt; &gt;2                              1/1             3/2                4/2<br/>&gt; &gt;3                              1/1        4/3         5/3      6/3<br/>&gt; &gt;4                              1/1    5/4    6/4     7/4     8/4<br/>&gt; &gt;5                              1/1  6/5  7/5  8/5  9/5  10/5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; His first partial only produces dissonance around 1/1 and 2/1, in<br/>&gt; proximity to the steady tone&apos;s partials.

For example, I could give you two totally,<br/>&gt; utterly different-looking waveforms that sound almost exactly the same, by<br/>&gt; simply changing the relative phases of the partials.</p><p>The most astounding demonstration of that fact (to my eyes and ears) is to<br/>play two tones which are just slightly off from 3:1. It looks from the<br/>curve like there really ought to be some sort of &apos;beating&apos;, with the<br/>volumes changing as the tones go from cancelling each other out to not<br/>cancelling each other out over time, but no such effect happens.</p><p>-Bram</p></div><h3><a id=3596 href="#3596">ðŸ”—</a>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>6/15/1999 9:08:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul Erlich, TD 219.8]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Dante Rosati]<br/>&gt;&gt; If dissonance is an acoustic phenomena I don&apos;t think<br/>&gt;&gt; measurements should break down already at 13.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They begin to because many 13-limit ratios are so close to each<br/>&gt; other that proximity plays a larger role than limit.

Or, stated another way, 11/12 is<br/>very close to 12/13 and these can be adjusted many ways by multiplying<br/>each by a common factor such as 4/3 or 3/2 and so on.</p><p>and in the &quot;Lattice visualization of music in real time&quot; thread<br/>&gt;This is true, but Erv has used *many* other geometrical<br/>&gt;configurations, and one that I particularly like (and have posted<br/>&gt;on before) is his Logarithmic Harmonic Spiral.</p><p>Then you might be interested in the website &quot;Music Of The Spheres&quot;<br/><a href="http://websites.pagosa.net/hydrogenix/">http://websites.pagosa.net/hydrogenix/</a> in which the author puts the<br/>masses of the elements around a log spiral and finds that they show some<br/>clustering around the scale (and he has a 7/4 note :) which agrees with<br/>my own observations.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
