My goal is to clarify specific things about who notices comma shifts in what contexts. I wanted to get to something about the significance of the issue, but I just need to focus on something small for a rigorous experiment to meet scientific ideals.</p><p>I&apos;m hoping to get some pointers on research already done and published in journals. Though I&apos;ll accept other citations, I&apos;m looking for examples of controlled studies done with multiple subjects and submitted to statistical analysis. Anything that relates to tuning and temperament.</p><p>I&apos;ve read a lot of the literature on cultural systems, history, theory, and also on psychoacoustics (general issues of beats, combination tones, etc.), but I haven&apos;t seen anything with controlled subject-based studies focusing on tuning issues.</p><p>In a more open sense, I&apos;m interested in any opinions about what citations I should or shouldn&apos;t use in my experimental design proposal.</p><p>For the record: I have not gotten around to reading the many back issues of journals like Music Perception. I have read a large number of the standard books in the areas of tuning etc. I&apos;m just in the process of trying to get more into the official academic side of all this stuff, especially from a scientific psychological experimental perspective rather than only a musicology/music-theory perspective.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Aaron Wolf<br/><a href="http://wolftune.com">wolftune.com</a></p></div>
