No doubt someone here has tried that - and I&apos;m wondering if the result was good - and if a better alternative exists.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris</p><p>A &quot;triple BP&quot; has been suggested by Paul Erlich, and used by Ron himself.  Roughly, one step of it is 48.77&cent; (calculated off of a 1:3 of 1902&cent; because I&apos;m lazy), dividing the tritave into 39 equal parts.  However, the &quot;triple BP&quot; lets one get around the &quot;point&quot; of BP as it can function in a variety of different &quot;modalities&quot;.  Double BP has not been much spoken of...at around 73.15&cent; a step, it&apos;s close to both 16-EDO and 17-EDO at first but gets pretty far from either of them very quickly.  I think it could be great, and doesn&apos;t allow one to &quot;cheat&quot; on the basic premise of BP so easily.</p><p>But the thing with BP is that, because it&apos;s meant to treat the tritave as an octave, it sort of NEEDS to have wide steps, elsewise you&apos;ll end up with scales that have a huge number of steps.  My feeling is that if you&apos;re gonna buy into BP, you should buy the whole package: 3:5:7 and 5:7:9 as the primary consonances, 3:1 as the &quot;repeat period&quot;, and really &quot;stretched-out&quot; scales.  If you can&apos;t get down with those principles, why do BP at all?  There are other non-octave systems out there that would probably suit you better, like the Wendy Carlos Alpha or Beta scales, 88-cent Equal Temperament, 5th root of 7/5 (116.502-cent Equal Temperament)...or, geez, just go here:</p><p><a href="http://www.nonoctave.com/tuning/twelfth.html">http://www.nonoctave.com/tuning/twelfth.html</a></p><p>Click links in the sidebar to see other equal divisions of rational intervals.</p><p>The question you&apos;ve really gotta ask yourself is, &quot;what do I want in a tuning&quot;?  I&apos;m surprised that first you were talking about 17, 19, and 22, and now suddenly you&apos;re looking at BP.  BP has pretty much nothing in common with any of those...no fifths, no octaves, no hope of compatibility with common-practice music.  Any sort of BP would be a rough place to start, I would think, unless you were really into the principle behind it.</p><p>For the record, the temperament Gene suggested will be more difficult than an equal temperament to apply to a guitar.  You *can* do it with straight, unbroken frets, but they will be unequally spaced and some frets on some strings will produce out-of-scale notes (or else there will be notes in the scale that don&apos;t appear in some positions on some strings).  There may also be frets uncomfortably close together in some places, depending on how you want to tune the open strings.  I&apos;d only recommend it if you were really in love with the temperament, otherwise you may end up with a guitar you don&apos;t play because it requires too much &quot;work&quot;.  The problem with unequally-spaced frets is that every time you retune an open string, you change the &quot;gamut&quot; of notes available to you, and unless you tune in a &quot;drone&quot; tuning (i.e. something like DGDGGD), you&apos;ll have a hard time making a mental map of which notes are where on the fretboard.</p><p>That&apos;s what happened to me with the Catler 12-tone Ultra Plus, which adds JI frets in between 12-tET frets.  I loved it to fool around with, and it sounded good, but it was too difficult to approach &quot;systematically&quot; and I lost interest in it very quickly.  I got sick of being unable to play full scales on it, and having to wrack my brain to keep track of what JI chords were available to me in a given open-string tuning.  I&apos;m not trying to discourage you from using a linear temperament/subset of a high-numbered EDO, I&apos;m just trying to make you aware of the difficulties they pose on guitar.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=90193 href="#90193">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2010 8:21:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the thing with BP is that, because it&apos;s meant to treat the tritave as an octave, it sort of NEEDS to have wide steps, elsewise you&apos;ll end up with scales that have a huge number of steps.

But it&apos;s a useful table for comparing, you can see all the cents-values for all the intervals in all these divisions right on top of each other, so you can see &quot;well, THIS one has a decent fifth but no major third, THAT one has a near 8/7 major second...etc. etc.&quot;</p><p>&gt; As for what do I want in a tuning - I haven&apos;t decided entirely yet -<br/>&gt; except not something 12-ish.

I&apos;m just used to people having really strong impressions of what they will accept or not.  Usually the crowd that likes 22-EDO and 19-EDO isn&apos;t keen on BP, so I was just (pleasantly) surprised to see that you actually ARE open to tunings with no fifth or octave!

It means means nothing to me.<br/>&gt; Every field has its terminology that one needs to learn - essentially<br/>&gt; another language. Chemistry,  geology, music theory, medicine... etc.<br/>&gt; etc.</p><p>Ah, well, let me clarify: &quot;moment of symmetry&quot; is a concept of scale construction.  The circle of fifths is a prime example of the moment of symmetry concept.  Basically: pick any two intervals, one to be a &quot;generator&quot; and another to be a &quot;period&quot;.  You can make scales by adding the generators together in a series, and subtracting the period any time the sum of generators surpasses it.  A &quot;moment of symmetry&quot; is a point wherein you have exactly two sizes of intervals between the consecutive notes in your scale.  Think of the circle of fifths in 12-tET: when you have one fifth, F-C-F, you have your first MOS, a two-note scale of Large step--small step (Ls), where L = a fifth and s = a fourth.  Add another fifth, G, and you have F-G-C-F.  This is the next MOS, a scale of sLL, where s = a whole tone and L = a perfect fourth.  Add another fifth, D, giving F-G-C-D-F: NOT a moment of symmetry, because there are three step sizes: a whole tone (F-G, C-D), a fourth (G-C), and a minor third (D-F).  Basically, with an interval of a fifth of 12-tET and a period of an octave, you get moments of symmetry at 2, 3, 5, and 7 notes, hitting an &quot;equal&quot; scale at 12 notes.</p><p>Not all scales with only two step-sizes are MOS scales: consider the &quot;melodic minor&quot; in 12-tET of LsLLLLs: this scale cannot be produced by a series of fifths, or of any generator (to my knowledge); it is, rather, a permutation of the diatonic MOS scale.  Similarly, Paul Erlich&apos;s &quot;Pentachordal&quot; scales in 22-EDO/Pajara are not MOS scales, but his &quot;Symmetrical&quot; scales are; the Pentachordal scales are permutations of the Symmetrical scales (his paper on &quot;Tuning, Tonality, and Twenty-Two Tone Temperament&quot; is a great read if you can gloss over the more abstract concepts in the beginning).</p><p>MOS scales are important because they serve to &quot;unify&quot; sets of equal temperaments.  Just as 12, 17, 19, 22, 26, 27, 29, and 31-EDO have a diatonic scale (because they all have pretty good &quot;fifths&quot;, which is the generator for the diatonic scale), other sets of EDOs have other scales in common (even as their harmonic properties may differ).  Finding MOS scales that you like can help you evaluate various temperaments, and give some indication of a temperament&apos;s musical utility (especially when coupled with an assessment of its harmonic properties).  This is why I like 23-EDO: it&apos;s got several of my favorite MOS scales, more so than any other equal temperament.  Sadly, it&apos;s also a tad too many notes for my liking; I prefer one instrument for each of my favorite scales, really.  But if I had to have only ONE microtonal instrument, it&apos;d be in 23.  But I&apos;d never have known that about 23 if I&apos;d only looked at it from a harmonic standpoint.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=90225 href="#90225">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2010 11:01:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; However, when you<br/>&gt; started to toss out terms like MOS frankly I drew a blank.

For example, if you choose to make an octave-periodic temperament where 81/80 vanishes, the only information this gives you is the fact that 1 generator approximates 3/2 and 4 generators approximate 5/1 (or you may use fourths instead of fifths if you prefer). But whether you eventually make a 7-tone diatonic scale out of this (i.e. a chain of 6 generators) or a 12-tone chromatic scale (11 generators) or a 19-tone enharmonic scale (18 generators), it&apos;s completely up to you.</p><p>#2.

It&apos;s not difficult to get this and it&apos;s also very useful to understand for the sake of compositional possibilities, so I think it&apos;s worth it.</p><p>In meantone, for example, the period is the octave (since the scale steps repeat after spanning one octave) and the generator is a tempered fifth or fourth (some people prefer fourths as generators but that&apos;s another story, let&apos;s go with fifths). So 2/1 is one octave, 3/1 is approximated by one octave and a fifth, and 5/1 is approximated by 4 fifths. So if the first number of every pair means the number of periods and the second number means the number of generators needed for one particular approximation, then it&apos;s &quot;1, 0&quot; for 2/1, &quot;1, 1&quot; for 3/1, and &quot;0, 4&quot; for 5/1.<br/>Obviously, if you used fourths as generators instead of fifths, the mapping would then be different. That&apos;s why it&apos;s always necessary to know not only the period&amp;generator mapping but also the size (either in cents or as a ratio) of the period and the generator.</p><p>In contrast, in hanson, for example, the generator is a slightly wider minor third. So 2/1 is represented by one octave, 3/1 is represented by 6 &quot;wider minor thirds&quot;, and 5/1 is represented by 5 minor thirds + one octave. So the mapping for hanson is &quot;1, 0&quot; for 2/1, &quot;0, 6&quot; for 3/1, and &quot;1, 5&quot; for 5/1.</p><p>For some reason, many people prefer listing the mapping vertically -- i.e. you have to read one particular column, not one line, to know the mapping for one particular interval.</p><p>That&apos;s it. :-)</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=90306 href="#90306">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2010 12:13:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For my part no,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And that would be wonderful Gene!!</p><p>Thinking about such an article, it seems to me it would depend too heavily on what kind of language you had to program in.

In actuality, tunings are not made, they are &quot;found&quot;, since they are all based on mathematics which is universal and transcendent and perhaps even absolute.  To &quot;find&quot; tunings, it helps to know where to look, what you&apos;re looking for, and HOW to look.</p><p>Like you, I tend to shy away from anything that suggest I have to learn and/or do math BEFORE I can make music.  I am a musician, not a mathematician, and I resent being &quot;seduced&quot; into math for the purpose of making music.  That said, the alternative tuning universe is vast and densely-populated.  To set out to explore it without a map is dangerous, for you risk getting totally lost and never finding that for which you are seeking.</p><p>Now, there are a LOT of maps out there, and none of them really cover all of the terrain.  The &quot;regular mapping paradigm&quot; (i.e. the one that produces the largest array of indecipherable specialist notation and esoteric jargon) is the most comprehensive map yet made, because it unifies JI theory with equal and unequal temperaments.  It also unifies the idea of harmonies as JI-approximations with the melodic structure of moment-of-symmetry scales, allowing one to look at a given scale and know both its harmonic properties AND its melodic properties (assuming one has a good idea of what generators produce which shape of MOS scales).  This paradigm even gives an &quot;access point&quot; for working with unmanageably-dense EDOs, like 271-EDO or 840-EDO, because you can break them down to smaller subsets which have the unified structure of familiar temperament classes.  I.e. you could &quot;manage&quot; 55-EDO by treating it as &quot;meantone&quot; and using a 12-note meantone subset of it.</p><p>Basically, if you know how a given linear temperament class works (like meantone), and you know the generator &quot;range&quot; for that class (i.e. a fifth sharper than that of 7-EDO but flatter than that of 12-EDO), you can be sure any equal temperament that produces a generator *in that range* will function *as that linear temperament*, at least to a certain degree of accuracy.  This effectively reduces the vast infinitude of equal temperaments to a manageable number of temperament classes, effectively reducing the amount of learning and exploration one must do to find &quot;the good stuff&quot;.</p><p>Now, this paradigm has several flaws: one, it&apos;s got a steep learning curve, until someone can find a way to explain it (and its notation and jargon) in a concise and systematic way.  Two, it&apos;s more cumbersome than necessary for people who have a narrowly-defined field of interest in the alternate-tuning universe (i.e. me, who is interested fairly exclusively in EDOs &lt;36).  Three, it&apos;s totally useless for other areas (non-Western historical/traditional tunings, strict JI, and scales based on irrational intervals not meant to approximate JI).  Four, the distinction between two temperament classes is not always all that musically significant.</p><p>Aaand...five (this one deserves its own paragraph): the boundaries between temperament classes aren&apos;t always clear or well-defined (and in fact, the paradigm does not seem to offer any good tools for determining these boundaries).  You can&apos;t always tell what the &quot;mapping&quot; will be from the generator, because two generators very close in size might produce different mappings (viz 350&cent; and 355&cent;: the former is Mohajira, the latter Beatles).  Also, there exist scales (many scales, in fact), which are at the &quot;boundary&quot; between two temperaments.  7-EDO, for instance, is both Meantone AND Mavila, in that prime 5 (the major third) maps both to 4 generators AND 13 generators.  Likewise, 12-EDO is both Meantone and Superpyth.  In fact--though I don&apos;t have a proof of this--any EDO can be seen as a &quot;boundary&quot; between two &quot;related&quot; temperaments.</p><p>The upshot of this is that if you extend the &quot;regular mapping paradigm&quot; to an arbitrarily-high level of exactitude in mapping primes, you have to divide a given temperament-class into an infinite amount of subclasses, as at some point the difference in size between two very similar generators will cause a deviation in the mapping of some prime, thus splitting the temperament class.  The &quot;classes&quot; are only valid if you arbitrarily set a &quot;limit&quot; to the primes you wish to approximate (AND to the acceptable level of error for the approximation...22-EDO can be said to map prime 5 to 4 generators (and thus be a meantone) IF you can accept an error of 50&cent; in the mapping).  Thus &quot;linear temperament classes&quot; are essentially arbitrary, and not absolute, so there is room for debate on whether two similar temperaments are in fact distinct or not (like &quot;Beatles&quot; and &quot;Mohajira&quot; or &quot;Bug&quot; and &quot;Beep&quot;, etc. etc.).</p><p>Bottom line is this: the &quot;regular mapping&quot; paradigm is powerful but also limited, and before deciding whether to learn it or dismiss it, it&apos;s good to know what its strengths and weaknesses are.  I hope I&apos;ve done an acceptable job of characterizing them here.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=90311 href="#90311">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2010 3:03:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Any volunteers?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; By the way, you may be asking why I want volunteers instead of<br/>&gt; &gt; explaining how to do it from within Scala.
