You might be able to find a<br/>second-hand DX7 II.  Or a TX81Z and plug an input keyboard into it.<br/>That&apos;s starting to get more and more pointless, though, because soft<br/>synths are getting so good at copying them (I don&apos;t even think it&apos;s<br/>even &quot;emulating&quot; because they just use the same algorithms).  And a<br/>TX81Z in particular is lousy for physical interaction.  All you get is<br/>a few buttons to press.  It&apos;s the same kind of user interface you get<br/>with a digital watch or video recorder of the same vintage.</p><p>Perhaps you&apos;re thinking of analog.  There are boxes that convert MIDI<br/>signals in to analog control voltages.  The trouble is, I don&apos;t think<br/>any of them work with microtonal tunings at all.  There are some nice<br/>digital keyboards that emulate analogs, with knobs and tuning, but not<br/>at entry level.  And there are some lovely software packages.</p><p>Really, the path of least resistance is just to get a cheap input<br/>keyboard and a USB/MIDI convertor.  Then play with soft synths on the<br/>computer you must already have to be sending these e-mails.  Even if<br/>you don&apos;t like that setup, at least you&apos;ll have more idea what to look<br/>for when you go shopping for a performance synth, or a knob box.</p><p>                            Graham</p></div><h3><a id=59193 href="#59193">ðŸ”—</a>Guglielmo &#x3C;gugliel@guglielmomusic.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2005 4:04:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I too thought a better answer than I could give would surface, too, but here&apos;s another contribution:</p><p>as an example keyboard (among others, no doubt) the kurzweil K2600 and K2500 keyboards can be set easily to different temperaments; they are available in good condition used, and are good quality keyboards that can be played by a pianist without disgust; they are synthesizers that come with a good variety of sounds.

Once it is on your system, and you&apos;ve installed<br/>whatever drivers needed for the kbd, you can use that kbd to play any<br/>of the 1000&apos;s of scales in the Scala collection, or use Scala to<br/>create your own entirely new scales. The kbd will use the sound card<br/>in your computer.</p><p>This will get you hearing and working with your tunings. It isn&apos;t an<br/>ideal situation for making more sophisticated musical settings, but<br/>for that there are a growing number of software synthesizers and<br/>samplers that not only are less expensive than hardware, but many now<br/>support a number of tuning file formats, all creatable with Scala.<br/>Design a scale/tuning in Scala, save a file, import it into a software<br/>instrument - voila! - you can now use it with a myriad of sounds.</p><p>I don&apos;t have time for links, but you can find software tuning support<br/>info at the link Graham provided. I can tell you the following, which<br/>I use, fully support any tuning I&apos;d like:</p><p>Virsyn Tera 2.0<br/>rgc:audio z3ta+<br/>BigTick Rhino 2.0<br/>LinPlug CronoX 3.0 and Alpha 2.0</p><p>I know the above inexpensive solution works, because we&apos;ve recently<br/>gotten a fellow tuning list person, with no experience in this, from<br/>nowhere to playing his own custom scale.</p><p>HTH,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=59195 href="#59195">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2005 3:55:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Guglielmo &lt;gugliel@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I too thought a better answer than I could give would surface, too, but<br/>&gt; here&apos;s another contribution:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as an example keyboard (among others, no doubt) the kurzweil K2600 and<br/>&gt; K2500 keyboards can be set easily to different temperaments; they are<br/>&gt; available in good condition used, and are good quality keyboards that<br/>&gt; can be played by a pianist without disgust; they are synthesizers that<br/>&gt; come with a good variety of sounds.

Nothing fancy, and there is a bit of latency (at least<br/>&gt; for me - all I&apos;ve used to hear the tunings is the built-in GS MIDI<br/>&gt; synth on the computer sound card; I&apos;ve never tried to see if it would<br/>&gt; relay to something else, and if Manuel could ever incorporate using<br/>&gt; VST instruments with ASIO drivers, it would be *really* happening...).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ha - that works indeed! Version 2.2s, BTW. With the computer&apos;s SW<br/>synth, indeed a lot of latency, though...
