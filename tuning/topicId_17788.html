        <a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Review of Ed Foote's Beethoven CD</h1><h3><a id=17788 href="#17788">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2001 9:55:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I sent $16 to</p><p>   Ed Foote<br/>   1506 Cedar Lane<br/>   Nashville, Tn. 37212</p><p>and just receive his wonderful CD, &quot;Beethoven in the Temperaments&quot;<br/>(Gasparo GSCD-332).  I thought it might be appropriate to post some<br/>impressions.</p><p>The CD is very professionally made, with a fat booklet (36 pages!) which<br/>explains the historical perspective to what Ed has done.  It&apos;s true,<br/>unfortunately, that no actual numbers for the tunings used are part of<br/>this booklet, but I can understand why - even I, a tuning afficianado<br/>(sp?), found the information included to be almost exhausting in its<br/>detail, aimed at bringing up to speed those who have never questioned<br/>12-tET.</p><p>Included are: Sonata, Op. 13 (&quot;Pathetique&quot;), Op. 14 No. 1, Op. 27 No. 2<br/>(&quot;Moonlight&quot;), and Op. 53 (&quot;Waldstein&quot;).  All are ably played by Enid<br/>Katahn on a great sounding and competently recorded Steinway D grand<br/>piano (serial number 467858 - how&apos;s THAT for specific info?).</p><p>I found nothing objectionable about the tuning(s) used, compared to<br/>12-tET.  At no place did I hear a chord that sounded sour to my ear,<br/>compared to 12-Tet.  My only complaint, and this is HIGHLY personal, is<br/>that I wanted more tunings changes, adaptive at that!  Such a feat is<br/>not possible today except through the highly inferior medium of MIDI and<br/>realizations thereof.  Nor, of course, would any such further<br/>modifications be true to Ed&apos;s goal of replicating what Beethoven himself<br/>might have heard as he composed these works.</p><p>If Ed, and others who are working along similar lines, are having<br/>trouble (and I suspect they are) selling the idea of using tunings such<br/>as these in concerts around the globe, it may be because the effects are<br/>fairly subtle.  That, and the fact that an acoustic piano should be<br/>tuned far in advance of any concert date, which makes 12-tET compelling<br/>for any location which does not have a nice grand to &quot;spare&quot; for some<br/>other tuning.</p><p>OTOH, my own sensations as to subtlety of tuning regard may be heavily<br/>skewed by my experiments with much more radical departures from 12-tET.</p><p>I will definitely pull this CD off the shelf whenever I want to hear<br/>these works done on an acoustic piano.  Congratulations, Ed!!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
