I&apos;m back home in Philly after a wonderful trip<br/>to southern California, and have just spent the day catching<br/>up on all the Tuning Digests I received while away.</p><p>It was great to once again see Jonathan Glasier, John<br/>Chalmers, Denny Genovese, Bill Wesley (and a couple of<br/>amazing new instruments he&apos;s built), Jeff Stayton, Brink<br/>[= John McBryde], and Kraig Grady.  And the highlight<br/>of this trip:  my first meeting with Erv Wilson.</p><p>Unfortunately I didn&apos;t have time to see everyone I wanted to.<br/>Apologies to Jon Szanto, Dave Hill, Harvey Starr, and my<br/>friends who teach at UCSD (John Fonville, Rand Steiger,<br/>Aleck Karis, Harvey Sollberger, George Lewis), which was<br/>closed for winter break.</p><p>The good news is:  I&apos;ll be moving back to San Diego within<br/>the next month or so (thanks principally to the magnanimity<br/>of Jonathan Glasier), so there will be plenty of opportunities<br/>for future get-togethers.</p><p>There&apos;s a lot of interesting stuff from the past week+ of<br/>Tuning Digests to which I&apos;d like to contribute.  This one<br/>jumped out at me first:</p><p>&gt; [John Link, TD 480.3]<br/>&gt; ONDAR AND THE EAGLES OF TUVA WITH<br/>&gt; TOM RUTISHAUSER AND JOE PEREIRA<br/>&gt; AT THE KNITTING FACTORY SUNDAY JANUARY 16   8PM<br/>&gt; MAIN STAGE      Call for tickets: $10 and at the door $12<br/>&gt; Knitting Factory 74 Leonard St ( btwn Broadway and Church)<br/>&gt; New York, NY 10013 tel: 212.219.3006<br/>&gt; Ondar and the Eagles of Tuva practice the centuries-old<br/>&gt; Tuvan art of throat-singing, in which a soloist can sing<br/>&gt; several notes simultaneously.  They also play traditional<br/>&gt; Tuvan instruments-the bowed igil and the doshpuluur.  The<br/>&gt; Tuvans combine their sounds with their long time associate<br/>&gt; Tom Rutishauser on electric cello.  Joe Pereira brings his<br/>&gt; array of percussion instruments from the New York Philharmonic.<br/>&gt; The show will center around the Tuvan music with a blend of<br/>&gt; free jazz and surprises.  Ondar is People&apos;s Throat-Singer of<br/>&gt; Tuva and is the star in the internationaly acclaimed film<br/>&gt; &quot;Genghis Blues&quot;; Igor K&#xFFFD;shkendey is the reigning world<br/>&gt; champion of throat-singing (UNESCO Festival of Throat-singing,<br/>&gt; 1998), and Yevgeny Saryglar is Ondar&apos;s star student at Ondar&apos;s<br/>&gt; School of Music in Kyzyl,capital of Tuva.</p><p>As luck would have it, I was calling Jonathan to invite he<br/>and his wife out to dinner my last night in San Diego (Saturday,<br/>the 8th), when he told me that they had plans to go see<br/>_Genghis Blues_ and that Ondar would be performing live<br/>after the movie.  This was at the Ken theater, scene of<br/>some of the most interesting cultural events in San Diego.</p><p>The movie is a documentary which chronicles the journey<br/>of blind San Francisco blues singer and throat-singing<br/>enthusiast Paul Pena to Tuva, to meet Ondar and participate<br/>in the throat-singing competition in Kyzyl.</p><p>(Paul Pena is now suffering from pancreatic cancer, and<br/>I encourage all who read this to search his name on the<br/>internet and find out where they can send a financial<br/>contribution to help him out.)</p><p>After the movie, Ondar and a handful of his students and<br/>other Tuvan cohorts sang and performed live in the theater.</p><p>Jonathan pointed out that he heard a very recognizable<br/>8/7 being used consistently for the &apos;major 2nd&apos;, while<br/>I noted how frequently the reinforced harmonics in the<br/>vocals hit a &apos;major 6th&apos;, which I thought sounded like<br/>27/16, but which (as Jonathan noted) had to be 13/8 because<br/>the fundamental, which the singers also sing in order to<br/>produce the harmonics in the first place, would have to<br/>be an &apos;octave&apos; lower than the already very low note being<br/>sung.  We also both noticed that the 11th harmonic is<br/>almost never used in this singing.  The melodies use a<br/>very restricted set of pitches:  1/1  9/8  5/4  3/2  13/8.</p><p>But despite the quality of singing from both Ondar and<br/>his students, what I found most interesting was the playing<br/>of the _igil_ by a young Tuvan whose name I don&apos;t recall.</p><p>This is a bowed string instrument with a range and size<br/>approximately between a viola and a cello, but with a very<br/>soft veiled sound.  It has 3 strings, the lower two providing<br/>a drone on 1/1 and 3/2, and the highest being stopped by<br/>the fingers to produce the melody notes.  It sounded to me<br/>most like a sort of muted bagpipe.</p><p>In this man&apos;s playing, I *did* hear the 11/8 used frequently,<br/>in addition to the other pitches typically used in the<br/>throat-singing.  But the &apos;major 3rd&apos; was consistently played<br/>much flatter than a 5/4, sounding to me most like 11/9.</p><p>It was a great show, which I caught more-or-less by accident,<br/>and highly recommend New York area Listers to attend the<br/>concert.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
