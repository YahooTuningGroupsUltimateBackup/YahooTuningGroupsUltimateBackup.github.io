See these candid comments by a performer.<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sibelius-list/message/6889">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sibelius-list/message/6889</a></p><p>I happen to find that both an illuminating and not surprising story from a busy London orchestral musician. I am fully confident in everything he says, and frankly agree with a good portion of it.</p><p>*However!* That doesn&apos;t mean that the experience he portrays will be cloned, across the board, for every non-traditional, and especially non-12tet piece, that comes down the pike. I don&apos;t think you could find a more difficult challenge in the entire world than to attempt a new and complex notation for a large orchestra. And yet the more obvious attempt is to have music, in a notation, that falls somewhere between Joe Pehrson&apos;s &quot;one person and a recording&quot; and 80 people trying to find their way.</p><p>I believe Alison Monteith will go there. I believe, in a fashion, Kraig Grady has been there. I&apos;m sure there are other people who can point out other small to medium size groups that:</p><p>1. got people interested in the music enough to want to learn it (along with the notation)<br/>2. had a notation that was successful in transmitting the intent of the composition<br/>3. 1 + 2 = a quality performance</p><p>Maybe Toby Twining falls into this, and certainly John Luther Adams may be there as well.</p><p>An orch player going to a recording session is *not* the barometer of a new music with a new notation. It will work only with the passage of time AND music of compelling stature. IMO.</p><p>Also, Carl mentioned:<br/>&gt; I forsee enormous problems with establishing anything about<br/>&gt; the nature/success of a new music, but it doesn&apos;t bother me.</p><p>But I&apos;m sure it bothers composers writing that music, and the focus should be on them, not people chatting on the sidelines of art.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/26/2003 10:32:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Also, Carl mentioned:<br/>&gt;&gt; I forsee enormous problems with establishing anything about<br/>&gt;&gt; the nature/success of a new music, but it doesn&apos;t bother me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But I&apos;m sure it bothers composers writing that music, and the<br/>&gt;focus should be on them, not people chatting on the sidelines<br/>&gt;of art.</p><p>Exactly my point, Jon.
