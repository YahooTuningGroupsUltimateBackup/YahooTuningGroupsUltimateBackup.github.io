I think that &quot;ambiguous&quot; is indeed good way to<br/>describe it,<br/>and that Jeff&apos;s comment:</p><p>&gt; It is an interesting interval since it sounds like some<br/>&gt; kind of third but not any kind in particular. It doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; seem to want to move anywhere but doesn&apos;t give any trouble<br/>&gt; if it does.</p><p>Is very definitely correct and insightful.</p><p>   In particular, I&apos;ve found that we are so conditioned to think of thirds as either<br/>major or minor that when we hear something right between the two, our ears<br/>have a<br/>tendency from habit, to characterize it as one or the other.  The option to portray<br/>that kind of ambiguity can be a useful to tool for composers;  it makes listeners<br/>reconsider the basis behind our impressions of majors and minors.</p><p>   I have found, at least in an 88CET environment, that melodic considerations<br/>suddenly have a stronger effect upon our impressions of whether a neutral<br/>third leaves<br/>a major-like impression, or a minor-like impression.  I suppose that&apos;s not surprising,<br/>since the harmony suggests neither.</p><p>   One interesting-sounding progression in 88CET based upon the ability to<br/>split the<br/>fifth in half to get a neutral third, then that in half to get a small whole<br/>step, is<br/>the following ... &quot;horn-shaped&quot; perhaps? ... voice leading pattern.  I&apos;ll<br/>characterize<br/>it below in 88-cent steps above whatever root note you&apos;d like to use, that<br/>root being<br/>represented here as 0 of course:</p><p>                       16<br/>                  14<br/>             12        12<br/>        10        10<br/>    8         8         8<br/>         6         6<br/>              4         4<br/>                   2<br/>                        0</p><p>   I used this progression to begin the fourth movement of my &quot;Alternative<br/>Fuels&quot;<br/>suite.  I find stacks of four, five, and more neutral thirds more interesting<br/>than<br/>just neutral triads.  That&apos;s true of 9:7s as well:  I find stacks of four or<br/>more<br/>9:7s interesting-sounding than supramajor triads.</p><p>   As for using 8 per 3:2 rather than 88CET, that strikes me as an interesting<br/>thought.  Clearly the two are very similar of course.  I originally conceptualized<br/>88CET as 11 per 7:4 (88.075CET), but 88 was more convenient.  I suppose<br/>87.745CET<br/>is at a slight disadvantage when it comes to approximating 5:2 and 7:4.  But<br/>there<br/>are probably counterexamples, and the difference is pretty small either way.</p><p>   I have toyed with the idea of expanding an 88-cent interval size to<br/>somewhere<br/>around 88 1/4 cents to make it less like 41 per triple-octave.  88.25CET would<br/>miss<br/>the triple-octave by 18.25 cents rather than 8.</p><p>   Jeff mentioned not liking 9:7 as much as 11:9 and 7:6.  As I&apos;ve mentioned before<br/>on the list, I think the key to understanding 9:7 is to avoid thinking of it<br/>as a<br/>major-like third, but instead as a shocking or perhaps &quot;freaky&quot;-sounding third<br/>instead.</p></div>
