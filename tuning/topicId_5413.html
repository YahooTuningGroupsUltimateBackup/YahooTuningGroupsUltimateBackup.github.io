And in this sense &quot;OTHER WORLDS&quot; could also be said<br/>to have something emotionally and sonically in common with both the<br/>early guitar improvisations of say Fred Frith, and the otherworldly<br/>electronic sounds of the classic Sci-Fi soundtrack.</p><p>As far as specific tunings, tracks 1, 2 &amp; 4 feature 34, 19 &amp; 12-tone<br/>equal temperament respectively, and track 3 features on overdubbed<br/>duet of Neil on fretless guitar and John Starrett on the StarrBoard...<br/>but with all the various phasing and echo effects, the music&apos;s<br/>emphasis is not really contingent on any specific tuning per say, but<br/>rather on the overall sense of otherworldliness... and to that end,<br/>the alternate tunings certainly do contribute heartily.</p><p>One of the most impressive aspects of this CD, is that these long<br/>texture based pieces accomplish a continued sense of direction &amp;<br/>organic development - they have real compositional arches so to speak.<br/>And with running times of 17:02, 10:55, 10:37 &amp; 17:57, I personally<br/>found this to be most appealing.</p><p>For anyone who is interested in Neil or his CD&apos;s, he can be contacted<br/>by email: &lt;<a href="mailto:stick@uswest.net">stick@uswest.net</a>&gt;, or via the Pony Express:</p><p>Neil Haverstick<br/><a href="http://P.O.Box">P.O.Box</a> 150271<br/>Lakewood, CO.<br/>80215</p><p>Dan</p><p>PS - For anyone who might be interested in more information about the<br/>StarrBoard that John Starret uses on this CD, see:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/StarrBoard.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/StarrBoard.html</a>&gt;</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/1999 2:12:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you, Dan!</p><p>-C.</p></div>
