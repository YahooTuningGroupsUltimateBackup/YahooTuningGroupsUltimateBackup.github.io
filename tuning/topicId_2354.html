Rather than being a missed harmonic<br/>opportunity, the dissonant sixth gave the music impetus to move forward and<br/>resolve.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>You&apos;re saying that the Greeks sounded this ratio in their music, but didn&apos;t<br/>consider it consonant?  Does that mean that the only &quot;consonant&quot; ratios were<br/>3/2 and 4/3?</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>I don&apos;t know what you mean. There&apos;s plenty of technology that can measure such<br/>things to sufficient accuracy.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s not clear to me that the above statement is entirely accurate.  It&apos;s<br/>true that it is relatively simple to measure the frequency of a simple<br/>periodic waveform that does not vary over time, but signals of that degree of<br/>simplicity rarely occur in music.  Even a simple periodic waveform whose<br/>harmonic content is changing as a function of time is difficult to measure,<br/>especially if a small amount of the<br/>spectral energy is expressed in the fundamental.  That can be done, to some<br/>degree of accuracy, but it it&apos;s quite difficult to determine what the<br/>accuracy actually is, depending on the system you are using for your<br/>measurement.</p><p>When you get into directly measuring the frequencies of notes that are<br/>sounded together, you are in a whole different universe, and one that is not<br/>thoroughly analyzed.  At least that was the state of the art a few years ago,<br/>when I had a lengthy discussion on the subject with a lot of knowledgeable<br/>people.   That may have been on the Mills College Tuning List, or a music<br/>discussion group on Bix.  I suppose if it was the Mills College List, then<br/>some of the present correspondents might remember.</p><p>Perhaps the state of the art has been recently fundamentally improved?</p><p>I suppose you could put musicians in isolation from on another and<br/>electronically control the distribution of sounds, and thus isolate all<br/>single channel musical instruments so that pitch analysis would be easier.<br/>That would still be not help for multiple voice acoustical instruments like<br/>guitars or violins.  Does anyone know of such a project?</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>&gt; The limitations of the chain of fifths idea have been discussed in this<br/>forum<br/>&gt; many times.  It seems to me that lattices are just an extension of this<br/>&gt; concept and suffer from the same limitations.  These  concepts, a kind of<br/>&gt; musical parallelism, are useful, but I find other methods better, especially<br/>&gt; in the context of discretely-tuned electronic musical instruments.</p><p>Oh?<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>I am often faced with the problem of getting accurately-tuned music from a<br/>discretely tuned electronic musical instrument.  For example, wavetable<br/>synthesis can be viewed mathematically as a frequency divider.  To assess<br/>what JI scales you can accurately produce on a frequency divider, you only to<br/>know the maximum LCM the frequency divider can accommodate.  Unfortunately,<br/>present day musical instrument manufacturers will not divulge such<br/>information, but if you have it, you can rather simply determine what scales<br/>you can use, for example with my Aliq program.</p><p>With a lattice approach you might, for example use the familiar:</p><p>6 9<br/>5 8 15<br/>4 6 16</p><p>to generate the following scale:</p><p>1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 64/45 3/2 8/5 5/3 16/9 15/8</p><p>The LCM of this scale is 1,036,800.  Using Aliq, or the LCMscal program from<br/>FasTrak, it is fairly simple to ascertain that there are eight 14-tone scales<br/>with this LCM, and a total of 69 scales with 12 or more tones.  To get this<br/>information with a lattice process is tedious, at best.  Just multiplying a<br/>number of lattice elements together is prone to producing scales that have a<br/>low LCM to tone ratio.  In other words, scales which will not fully utilize<br/>the tuning capacity of a discretely-tuned electronic musical instrument.</p><p>Of course, these considerations only apply to exact JI.  If you allow<br/>approximation to come into the picture, then you are in a different universe,<br/>which in my opinion is not a JI universe but a tempered universe.</p><p>In a more general sense, I find LCM useful because it describes the pattern<br/>of waveform interference when a chord is sounded.  Here, I am speaking of the<br/>LCMs of the periods of the sounds, not the frequency, though in practice, not<br/>a lot is lost by using the LCMs of the frequencies.  I am not claiming LCM is<br/>a completely accurate description of consonance, but I think it certainly<br/>tracks a lot better than limits, be they prime or odd.  It is certainly<br/>possible to generate 3-limit intervals that nearly everyone would find<br/>dissonant.</p><p>Not all high LCM chords are perceived as dissonant.  A good example is 12et<br/>in which all intervals except the octave have an infinite LCM.  On the other<br/>hand, all low LCM chords are perceived as consonant, as demonstrated by the<br/>perfect fifth with an LCM of 6, or the 5:3 with an LCM of 15, or the 5:4 with<br/>an LCM of 20.  Moreover, it can be demonstrated that those high limit chords<br/>that are perceived as consonant are in some sense a superset of some low LCM<br/>chord.  Take for example, the 12et fifth of 1.4983 etc.  The real LCM is so<br/>large that it is completely outside the pattern-recognition ability of the<br/>ear to integrate into the realm of harmony, so what the ear perceives is a<br/>fifth with changing phase and frequency relationships resulting in the famous<br/>&quot;beat&quot;.</p><p>The lattice approach is efficient for generating scales which contain<br/>specified parallelism.  That is the above lattice is guaranteed to generate<br/>scales which have 4:5:6 chords.  If some sense, the lattice elements are<br/>matrix factors of the scale.  You can use the aliq program to detect what<br/>parallelism exists in a scale by using the set select function from lattice<br/>mode.</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/>P.S. I think Margo Schulter addressed your comments in a much more polite but<br/>also<br/>much more historically informed way. How would you respond to her?<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>It seems to me that both you an Margo, as well as others on the list are much<br/>better informed on music history than I am, and I imagine things will stay<br/>that way as I am much more interested in the future than the past.  When I am<br/>studying the past I find it both interesting and informative, but my focus is<br/>on creating new technology.  While I have more time to devote to music now, I<br/>also have several other things going which demand my time and energy.</p><p>I have to admit that I haven&apos;t been paying a lot of attention to the list for<br/>the last couple of years while I was down in San Jose making some money.<br/>When you questioned my assertion about pentatonic scales, I didn&apos;t believe at<br/>first, and I did some web surfing to check.  I came across a paper by Margo,<br/>which I took as authoritative, but at that time I was unaware of her<br/>contributions to the list.</p><p>I did clip the Pythagorean Modes from her paper, and do some analysis from an<br/>LCM point of view.  It seems that Pythagorus somehow managed to include all<br/>seven of the scales with LCMs less than 2^10*3^6, or 746,496.  I&apos;m sure the<br/>Greeks were aware of LCM as an abstract concept, but it is unclear to me how<br/>they related it to music.</p><p>Also, I became interested in the problem of what smaller LCM approximations<br/>are available for Pythagorean ratios, so I took some ratios from the<br/>pythagorean modes and did some investigation.</p><p>The 16/9 ratio has an LCM of 144, but it can be approximated by 7/4 with an<br/>LCM of 28 and a 1.59% error.</p><p>The 27/16 ratio has an LCM of 432, but it can be approximated by 5/3 with an<br/>LCM of 15 and a 1.25% error.</p><p>The 32/27 ratio has an LCM of 864, but it can be approximated by 13/11 with<br/>an LCM of 143 and a 0.28% error.  It can also be approximated by 6/5 with an<br/>LCM of 30 and an error of 1.23%.</p><p>The 81/64 ratio has an LCM of 5184, but it can be approximated by 19/15 with<br/>an LCM of 285, and an error of 0.08%.  It can also be approximated by 5/4<br/>with an LCM of 20 and an error of 1.25%.</p><p>The 128/81 ratio has an LCM of 10,368, but it can be approximated by 19/12<br/>with an LCM of 228 and an error of 0.19%.  It can also be approximated by 8/5<br/>with an LCM of 40 and an error of 1.23%.</p><p>The 243/128 ratio has an LCM of 31,104, but it can be approximated by 19/10<br/>with an LCM of 190 with an error of 0.08%.</p><p>The 729/512 ratio has an LCM of 373,248, but it can be approximated by 10/7<br/>with an LCM of 70 and an error of 0.33%.</p><p>Is it possible that these musicians were trying to play 3-limit but were<br/>really playing 19 limit music?  We&apos;ll probably never know, but we may someday<br/>be able to accurately describe what contemporary musicians are doing with a<br/>reasonable degree of accuracy.</p><p>It seems clear to me that the 729/512 ratio at least was almost never used in<br/>practice.  At 440hz the pattern created by this interval would take 850<br/>seconds, or 14 minutes to repeat-longer than most songs.  Even the 32/27<br/>pattern would take almost 2 seconds at 440HZ.  Some of these claims of tuning<br/>accuracy seem a little shaky to me.</p><p>Marion</p></div>
