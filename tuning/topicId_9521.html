I wish I could make it.<br/>&#x9;To the rest of y&apos;all (you too, Johnny) I am<br/>currently broadcasting a show made from all the microtonal music I<br/>currently have in mp3 format. This is music from the tape swap, the<br/>forum CD, tuning punk submissions, and various others. You can listen with<br/>winamp or real player, among others, at <a href="http://132.194.200.113:8000">132.194.200.113:8000</a>. My server<br/>is on a 256K dsl line, broadcasting at 128Kbps, which is pretty high<br/>fidelity mp3. The bandwidth is real narrow for a media server, so it<br/>cannot handle many simultaneous listeners, but the software is supposed to<br/>cut the bitrate as the number of listeners increases.<br/>&#x9;I intend to keep broadcasting continually except for cd changes,<br/>and I would love to play a greater variety of microtonal music than I<br/>have, so if anyone wants to contribute a CD of mp3 files, I would be glad<br/>to try it. Write to me privately if you want to try this so that I may<br/>give you the necessary format.</p><p>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
