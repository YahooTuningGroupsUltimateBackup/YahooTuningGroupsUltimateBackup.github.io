A 4:5:6:7 is<br/>&gt;much more consonant and should be called a subminor 7th or (German)<br/>&gt;augmented 6th chord.</p><p>&gt;A dominant seventh chord has a _minor_ third stacked on a major triad<br/>&gt;(not a _subminor_ third).</p><p>As you know, Dave, your preferred tuning makes for a very high 7th<br/>note, 9:10 of the root above.  This is one of three JI choices (along<br/>with 12-tET) offered by Mark Nowitzky on his page:</p><p>   <a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/dom7.htm">http://www.pacificnet.net/~nowitzky/justint/dom7.htm</a></p><p>I go the opposite extreme, preferring my dominant 7ths to be tuned<br/>4:5:6:7, which makes for a very LOW 7th degree, at 7:8 of the root<br/>above.  In spite of the fact that this IS a consonant chord, as you say,<br/>to my ear it also has a wonderful longing that begs for resolution to<br/>tonic.  And the 21:20 transition (F to E in G7 -&gt; Cmaj) has a delightful<br/>smallness that counteracts the rather large 15:16 leading tone.</p><p>My sense is that most on this list would prefer a &quot;compromise&quot;, tuning<br/>the 7th degree as 8:9 of the root above.  Certainly the minor third<br/>thus formed (27:32) is nasty, but isn&apos;t dissonance the idea of 5-limit<br/>dominant 7ths?</p><p>Of course, in the end, it&apos;s all a matter of taste.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
