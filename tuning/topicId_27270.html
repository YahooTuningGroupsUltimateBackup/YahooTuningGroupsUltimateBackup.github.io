I believe they<br/>&gt; conceived of harmonic structure (intuitively, not theoretically) in<br/>&gt; basically the 12-tone manner in which it was notated and played.</p><p>We must agree to disagree.  I believe otherwise, that Bach conceived<br/>melodically, for each of his musical lines to be heard as distinct melodies.<br/>These melodies are &quot;microtonal&quot; in the sense that the tuning of<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s chromatic, far and wide the most popular well-temperament in<br/>Bach&apos;s time for the chromatic composers.  The character of the keys were<br/>imbedded in the musician&apos;s mind.</p><p>Frankly, people heard differently back then and I am trying to simulate it.<br/>Like parallel fifths and octaves, pure thirds in only 1 chord or key would<br/>give it too much attention in any comparisons with other keys.  So all thirds<br/>are to be tuned sharp.  This is not an admonition for what you had spoken<br/>about.</p><p>&gt; not referring to melodic schemes that contain shifts of 5 cents in<br/>&gt; pitch. I think that would seem to them the same way it does to me<br/>&gt; when I&apos;m thinking in terms of Baroque harmony: a tuning slide and not<br/>&gt; a separate, discrete pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>Surely they can discern and remember the 6 cents interval between the pure<br/>fifth of Werckmeister and the 1/4 comma flatted fifth of Werckmeister?  If I<br/>can, I suppose they can, too.</p><p>&gt; The multiple 31-tone keyboard schemes referred to in some threads<br/>&gt; here were not put in place as microtonal systems, but strictly out of<br/>&gt; a motivation to achieve mechanically accesible just harmonies.</p><p>You seem on solid ground here for 31-toners.  But Bach is not 31-tone ET.</p><p>&gt; &quot;blues&quot; and other folk melodic concepts therefore do not apply, I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think, to analysis of these issues for this music.</p><p>Not so quick.  If we are talking melodic traditions of intonation, why not<br/>&quot;blues&quot; or Thuringian folk music?  But if your bias is harmonic, it must be<br/>difficult to reorient towards something distinguishably melodic in priority.<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s tuning takes melody as a priority.  Little is really made<br/>between keys, as harmony based theories  would hunt for, but in the chromatic<br/>relationships relating to a central key.  Each key has its own universe of<br/>semantic meaning.</p><p>&gt; to apply it is to my mind, a superimposition of our times onto<br/>&gt; theirs.<br/>&gt;</p><p>And yet I think it is quite the reverse.  More on melodic pitch measurement<br/>soon.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=27283 href="#27283">ðŸ”—</a>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>8/23/2001 8:20:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bob had said:<br/>In Bach&apos;s time, microtonal melodies were not in vogue.</p><p>Johnny replied:<br/>&gt; We must agree to disagree.

Hope that&apos;s OK with you. If you think<br/>anything I said is out of conformity with anything you just stated in<br/>the previous paragraph, then I&apos;m not communicating myself to you<br/>well.</p><p>OF COURSE Bach conceived melodically, but also harmonically. That is<br/>inherent in counterpoint. If you could just write any old melody to<br/>combine polyphonically with any other old meldody, writing fugues<br/>would be a cinch, right? (But not gold-plated!)</p><p>Thought I had made it crystal clear that I recognize the inevitable<br/>microtonal differences between the &quot;same&quot; intervals inherent within<br/>just tunings and others that are not EDO!???! When I state that<br/>microtonal melodies were not in vogue, I DO NOT INCLUDE microtonal<br/>differences in diatonic and chromatic intervals! HOW ABSURD IT WOULD<br/>BE IF I DID! I WOULD BE EXCLUDING ALL SCALES THAT CONTAIN MICROTONAL<br/>DIFFERENCES IN THE &quot;SAME&quot; INTERVAL, such as the difference of a<br/>syntonic comma between the first and second Major seconds even in JI!</p><p>If we&apos;re considering my statments in the careful context I&apos;m trying<br/>to give them, I am at a total loss to understand why anyone would<br/>think for a millisecond that I meant that! I mean MELODIC microtonal<br/>moves, melodies that contain intervals significantly smaller than a<br/>chromatic half step. I would even accept as microtonal melodies any<br/>that consisted of several true chromatic half steps in  a row,<br/>juxtaposed, EXCLUDING enharmonic &quot;equivalents&quot;. Anyone know of such<br/>music from these periods, and I mean COMPOSED music, the ART MUSIC of<br/>the times? If such melodies WERE in vogue in Vicento&apos;s or Bach&apos;s<br/>time, I would be the first to want to know about it!</p><p>The melodic nuances that vary from key to key in Werckmeister are a<br/>CUMULATIVE result of these 6-cent differences between the just and<br/>tempered fifths. So, as you&apos;re clearly aware, this involves<br/>microtonal differences much greater than 6 cents among instances of<br/>the same interval type that shift relative positions in the scales.</p><p>As to reliably noticing that an unaccompanied melodic leap of, say, a<br/>perfect fifth is 5 or 6 cents either way from just, without any<br/>REFERENCE PITCH that would allow the perception to become HARMONIC,<br/>I&apos;m feeling a little like someone from Missouri. I have no problem,<br/>however, with accepting that the melodic character generated by such<br/>cumulative effects is necessarily embedded in a performer&apos;s melodic<br/>sense when performing with this or other such temperaments.</p><p>Respectfully yours,</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3><a id=27294 href="#27294">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2001 12:38:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:</p><p>&gt; I would even accept as microtonal melodies any<br/>&gt; that consisted of several true chromatic half steps in  a row,<br/>&gt; juxtaposed, EXCLUDING enharmonic &quot;equivalents&quot;.<br/>&gt; Anyone know of such<br/>&gt; music from these periods, and I mean COMPOSED music, the ART MUSIC<br/>of<br/>&gt; the times?
