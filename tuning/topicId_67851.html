In that case of course what<br/>one uses to seed the tree is irrelevant. But here, because we are looking at a correlation<br/>of three different trees, then the seeding of the et trees _is_ significant because the<br/>correlation depends on it.</p><p>If you look back to Dan&apos;s original post again, you will find that it all seems clear<br/>with hindsight and you wonder why you didn&apos;t get the message when you first<br/>read it, these sorts of things seem to work like that. You kind of skip over the<br/>details that don&apos;t seem to make sense because one has an expectation that<br/>the author is saying  something more ordinary in a clumsy way,when in fact<br/>he is saying something rather more novel and saying it precisely.</p><p>Sometimes there are undefined terms and that is why one misses<br/>what the author is syaing - but in the case of Dan&apos;s message, everything that<br/>one needed to know was actually there in the original post, and it is just a matter<br/>of somehow overcoming the reader&apos;s natural expectations that one is saying<br/>something else from what one is actually saying. So it needs, like more emphasis,<br/>repetition, and so on until the other person gets what it is about, this is normal<br/>and I don&apos;t think there is anything one can do about it except be patient and keep trying.<br/>It took me a day or two mulling it over from time to time before I finally got what he was saying.</p><p>So then that&apos;s why the next question for Dan is - how does one arrive at such seeds<br/>and what happens if one tries other seeds.</p><p>For mathematical proof I suppose one question is, does this pattern continue<br/>all the way down the tree to infinity, if so why, and if not, is there any choice of seed for<br/>which it does, or what is the maximum distance one can go down the tree in this<br/>way while preserving the bracketting of the ratios like this.</p><p>It is intriguing, looking at just the few rows I mapped out because the limits do bracket the<br/>ratios very nicely with the ratio right near the middle of the range between the two<br/>limits.</p><p>Anyway I hope the idea is clear now but if not do ask again. I&apos;m not sure if it needs to<br/>go to tuning math - complicated mathematical notation  would perhaps obscure it unless<br/>one needed it of course e.g. to construct a proof.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=67915 href="#67915">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2006 12:25:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was referring back to the previous post where the trees<br/>&gt; are defined.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By an et tree I just meant one that is based on<br/>&gt; fractional octaves so e.g. 3//5 in the tree<br/>&gt; means 3/5 of 1200 cents (or 3 steps of 5-et).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take Dan&apos;s example of the 0//2 and 3//3 tree.<br/>&gt; So just like the Stern Brocot tree,except that you start with<br/>&gt; 0//2 and 3//3 at the top.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Those are the seeds - the 0//2 etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Stern Brocot tree here is seeded<br/>&gt; with 1/1 and 2/1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reason the seed ratios for the tree are significant is because<br/>&gt; f the correlation between the three trees.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All three trees are constructed like the Stern Brocot tree, the only<br/>&gt; difference is in the interpretation of the numbers as ratios or<br/>&gt; as fractional octaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Stern.shtml">http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Stern.shtml</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So - here is the Stern Brocot tree (3 rows) interpreted as ratios:<br/>&gt; 1/1                                            2/1<br/>&gt;                        3/2<br/>&gt;             4/3                    5/3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Upper limits tree, interpreted as fractional octaves so I use the<br/>0//2 notation:<br/>&gt; 0//2                                              3//3<br/>&gt;                         3//5<br/>&gt;              3//7                       3//8</p><p>Shouldn&apos;t that be 6//8 = 3//4?</p><p>&gt; Lower limits tree:<br/>&gt; 0//3                                                      4//4<br/>&gt;                          4//7<br/>&gt;           4//10                            8//11<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then look in the same position in all three trees.

You can distort or fine tune the Just Intonation<br/>relationships with different seeding, but I use this seeding because<br/>it&apos;s the simplest way to create a tree where the smallest fractions of<br/>an octave correlate to the frequency ratio seeding of 1/1 and 2/1--and<br/>of course it&apos;s also important to note that the smaller the numbers in<br/>the fractions the larger the &quot;span&quot; between them. This is very<br/>important ,and the only seeding that works this way, if you want to<br/>interpret the results as unique interval spans that frame the pitch<br/>continuum with something akin to &quot;bounds of general<br/>recognize-ability&quot;, and in this sense I think it&apos;s quite interesting.<br/>(And as I&apos;ve said a few times, I&apos;m also attracted to its simplicity<br/>and pantheistic overtones.)</p><p>Anyway, I have no proof, but my instincts tell me the relationships<br/>extend into infinity just as the 1/1 and 2/1 seeding would--but as you<br/>might expect, the factions of an octave representing unique space are<br/>quite finite!</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/danstearns">http://www.myspace.com/danstearns</a></p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was referring back to the previous post where the trees<br/>&gt; are defined.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By an et tree I just meant one that is based on<br/>&gt; fractional octaves so e.g. 3//5 in the tree<br/>&gt; means 3/5 of 1200 cents (or 3 steps of 5-et).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Take Dan&apos;s example of the 0//2 and 3//3 tree.<br/>&gt; So just like the Stern Brocot tree,except that you start with<br/>&gt; 0//2 and 3//3 at the top.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Those are the seeds - the 0//2 etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Stern Brocot tree here is seeded<br/>&gt; with 1/1 and 2/1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reason the seed ratios for the tree are significant is because<br/>&gt; f the correlation between the three trees.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All three trees are constructed like the Stern Brocot tree, the only<br/>&gt; difference is in the interpretation of the numbers as ratios or<br/>&gt; as fractional octaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Stern.shtml">http://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Stern.shtml</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So - here is the Stern Brocot tree (3 rows) interpreted as ratios:<br/>&gt; 1/1                                            2/1<br/>&gt;                        3/2<br/>&gt;             4/3                    5/3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Upper limits tree, interpreted as fractional octaves so I use the<br/>0//2 notation:<br/>&gt; 0//2                                              3//3<br/>&gt;                         3//5<br/>&gt;              3//7                       3//8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lower limits tree:<br/>&gt; 0//3                                                      4//4<br/>&gt;                          4//7<br/>&gt;           4//10                            8//11<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then look in the same position in all three trees. For instance 4/3<br/>is the first ratio in the<br/>&gt; third row of the ratios tree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the same position in the upper limits tree we find 3//7<br/>&gt; In the same position in the lower limits tree we find 4//10<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then the result, conjecture, or whatever it is is that<br/>&gt; 4//10 &lt; 4/3 &lt; 3//7.<br/>&gt; and similarly for the other entries in the three trees<br/>&gt; So for instance, 8//11 &lt; 5/3 &lt; 3//8 etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For these few rows anyway, and for a few more rows as far as I<br/>explored it,<br/>&gt; the lower and upper bounds nicely bracket the ratio with<br/>&gt; a roughly equal sized gap to either  side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope this is clear now. One could set it all out using recurrence<br/>relations etc,<br/>&gt; but hopefully this is enough now to make it clear how it works. Do<br/>ask again if<br/>&gt; not - it is a simple idea and if it isn&apos;t coming over clearly,<br/>perhaps I have somehow<br/>&gt; made it seem  to complicated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These sorts of things are tricky to explain because of the<br/>similarity to something else<br/>&gt; which the reader anticipates that you are trying to say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - for instance we know that the ratios further down a single tree<br/>bracket the ratios further<br/>&gt; up which seemed to be where the confusion arose. In that case of<br/>course what<br/>&gt; one uses to seed the tree is irrelevant. But here, because we are<br/>looking at a correlation<br/>&gt; of three different trees, then the seeding of the et trees _is_<br/>significant because the<br/>&gt; correlation depends on it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you look back to Dan&apos;s original post again, you will find that it<br/>all seems clear<br/>&gt; with hindsight and you wonder why you didn&apos;t get the message when<br/>you first<br/>&gt; read it, these sorts of things seem to work like that. You kind of<br/>skip over the<br/>&gt; details that don&apos;t seem to make sense because one has an expectation<br/>that<br/>&gt; the author is saying  something more ordinary in a clumsy way,when<br/>in fact<br/>&gt; he is saying something rather more novel and saying it precisely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sometimes there are undefined terms and that is why one misses<br/>&gt; what the author is syaing - but in the case of Dan&apos;s message,<br/>everything that<br/>&gt; one needed to know was actually there in the original post, and it<br/>is just a matter<br/>&gt; of somehow overcoming the reader&apos;s natural expectations that one is<br/>saying<br/>&gt; something else from what one is actually saying. So it needs, like<br/>more emphasis,<br/>&gt; repetition, and so on until the other person gets what it is about,<br/>this is normal<br/>&gt; and I don&apos;t think there is anything one can do about it except be<br/>patient and keep trying.<br/>&gt; It took me a day or two mulling it over from time to time before I<br/>finally got what he was saying.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So then that&apos;s why the next question for Dan is - how does one<br/>arrive at such seeds<br/>&gt; and what happens if one tries other seeds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For mathematical proof I suppose one question is, does this pattern<br/>continue<br/>&gt; all the way down the tree to infinity, if so why, and if not, is<br/>there any choice of seed for<br/>&gt; which it does, or what is the maximum distance one can go down the<br/>tree in this<br/>&gt; way while preserving the bracketting of the ratios like this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is intriguing, looking at just the few rows I mapped out because<br/>the limits do bracket the<br/>&gt; ratios very nicely with the ratio right near the middle of the range<br/>between the two<br/>&gt; limits.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway I hope the idea is clear now but if not do ask again. I&apos;m not<br/>sure if it needs to<br/>&gt; go to tuning math - complicated mathematical notation  would perhaps<br/>obscure it unless<br/>&gt; one needed it of course e.g. to construct a proof.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=67917 href="#67917">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2006 11:01:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Robert.
