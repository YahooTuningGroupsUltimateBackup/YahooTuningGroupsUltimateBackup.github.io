The first message starts<br/>with a subject, and any replies to it (and, in a *well programmed<br/>mailing list*, the replies to the replies) will prepend &quot;Re: &quot; to<br/>that subject matter.</p><p>The entire reason for this is that if you subscribe in a normal<br/>manner (i.e. non-digest), you can use your email client to &apos;walk&apos; the<br/>thread of the subject and all it&apos;s replies, instead of looking at the<br/>posts as they come in chronologically.</p><p>It is *not* the individual people, writing their messages, who are<br/>repeating it. You *can* change a subject header by just writing a new<br/>post, but that defeats the purpose of being able to follow a thread.</p><p>And this is from someone who considers Warren a real swell guy!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
