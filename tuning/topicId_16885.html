Thanks for your input.</p><p>I went to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/Studio/7358">http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/Studio/7358</a><br/>And found the clavet as an interesting keyboard.</p><p>The best keyboard I believe will be one to cover all and I mean<br/>All tuning and microtunings will be a touch and velocity sensitive<br/>21 inch or larger monitor that can process multiple simultaneous<br/>Finger contacts. Since it will be a computer monitor one can program<br/>Any type on keyboard arrangement. The one very important<br/>element missing here is tactile feedback. Well, you cant have<br/>everything!</p><p>I have looked into this but the present technology can<br/>recognizoie only one finger contact at a time. No sustained<br/>notes, No chords can be played.</p><p>If any one ever makes a monitor alternate midi keyboard<br/>And is reasonably priced I will be the first buyer.</p><p>I am familiar to Starr&apos;s MicroZone keyboards.<br/>They are unfortunately beyond the reach of my budget.</p><p>The Monolith which is not in production.<br/><a href="http://www.electronic-mall.com/heavenbound/">http://www.electronic-mall.com/heavenbound/</a><br/>It is not velocity sensitive though the production<br/>Model if ever mfg. will be<br/>By the way I have Jacob Duringer&apos;s the<br/>Inventors of the Monolith two CD&apos;s.<br/>I was in communications to buy one of his<br/>Keyboards but he stopped all communications.</p><p>Vas</p></div>
