There&apos;s nothing much there yet, but there are a few MIDI examples to illustrate some of the tunings.</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/zireen-music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/zireen-music.html</a></p><p>Of particular interest is the Lemba example (<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/lemba.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/lemba.mid</a>). This is a new tuning that I&apos;ve been playing around with the last couple of weeks, identified by the wedgie [6, -2, -2, -17, -20, 1&gt;. It&apos;s a half-octave repeating temperament with useful 10-note and 16-note MOS scales; the TOP tuning has a period of 601.7004928 cents and a generator of 230.8749260 cents. This MIDI file is a very rough draft, without any attention to note velocities or volume controllers (which it needs), but it should give a rough idea of some of the potential in this tuning. I was starting to get a feel for the 16-note Lemba scale when I tried this melody that I&apos;ve had in the back of my mind for the last couple of years, and suddenly everything fell into place exactly as I&apos;d been imagining it!</p><p>Also new is the pajara example (<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/telek.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/telek.mid</a>). Telek is the Zireen name for pajara temperament; this is another melody that I&apos;ve had in my mind for a while and just recently got around to MIDIfying.</p><p>If you wonder why the kleismic example (<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/sinka.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/sinka.mid</a>) starts with an ocarina solo, it&apos;s my Scarecrow Song from Ocarina of Time (the Zelda game). (The Scarecrow Song is an 8-note melody you make up and play it to one of the scarecrows in the game on your ocarina.) For all the time I tried writing Zireen music in kleismic[11], I don&apos;t have much in the way of MIDI files to show for it.</p><p>And you may have heard the superpelog and beep examples before, but here they are for completeness:<br/><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/mahali.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/mahali.mid</a><br/><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/hanaki.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/hanaki.mid</a></p></div><h3><a id=53543 href="#53543">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2004 5:09:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Of particular interest is the Lemba example<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/lemba.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/ex/lemba.mid</a>).

If so, I can provide Lemba variations &gt; of these &apos;standard&apos; (Diatonic/Syntonic/Meantone) flora overlays:</p><p>I&apos;ve settled on a system based on 26-ET notation. Here&apos;s the basic 16-note scale:</p><p>0  3  6 1  4  7 2  5 0  3  6 1  4  7 2  5 0<br/>A  Ax B B# C  CxDb D#Dx E  ExF  Fx G G# AbA<br/>  (Bbb)(Cbb)        (Ebb) (Fb) (Gbb)</p><p>Small steps (-5 generators) are represented by a sharp and large steps (+3 generators) by a double sharp. The exception is the group of notes based on D# (there&apos;s no &quot;D&quot; in this system): (D#)# is simply written as Dx and (D#)bb is written as Db. I thought about just notating D# as D, but I doubt there&apos;s much point in going beyond 26 steps of this tuning, and writing it as D# makes it easier to remember.</p><p>This actually ends up being pretty easy to read (until you start getting into the enharmonic equivalents). The main melody of the example goes like this:</p><p>A-- B C E-- F Ex | E-- C----- D#-- | E----- C B# B | C-------</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve taken to calling the 5-limit kleismic system &apos;Hanson&apos;, after its &gt; seeming discoverer Larry Hanson, but haven&apos;t decided on names for the &gt; various 7-limit extensions yet . . .</p><p>The one I&apos;ve been using is the version with a 64/63 comma, with the wedgie [6, 5, 3, -6, -12, -7&gt;.</p></div><h3><a id=53546 href="#53546">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2004 9:51:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve taken to calling the 5-limit kleismic system &apos;Hanson&apos;, after its<br/>&gt; seeming discoverer Larry Hanson, but haven&apos;t decided on names for the<br/>&gt; various 7-limit extensions yet . . .</p><p>I really which you would not dismiss the idea of having 7-limit names<br/>correspond to 5-limit names with the same or similar generators.
