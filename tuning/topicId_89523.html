For example, the first repeated 3 chords sound fine, but the 4th sounds barely passable (IE still good to me, but I highly doubt the public would accept it).  Meanwhile the 5th chord sounds much like a mistake (not &quot;strategic/controlled dissonance&quot;...but as if the musician simply missed the correct chord completely)...IE it sounds bad to me and I&apos;m guessing most certainly bad to the average listener who&apos;s not, say, a common visitor on this list.</p><p>  Sadly, this perhaps confirms one of my most common criticisms...that most micro-tonal scales I hear seem to either focus on purifying a select relatively few chords (compared to, say, 12TET) or making something that sounds no different to the average musician than 12TET.</p><p>  I still say about 13 cents off a pure-sounding interval is about human tolerance...on the average...and that dyads around 11-limit (assuming the octave over that 11-limit interval is ALSO 11-limit or lower) represent the highest limit &quot;pure&quot; dyads.  And this isn&apos;t just from surveying my own scales, but looking over Wilson&apos;s scales, several TET scales including 15,16,22, 31 TET, Ptolemy&apos;s scales, and many more.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And while I can saturate my ears and make almost anything sound good to<br/>me usually after a break I can clearly hear the micro-tonalism.&quot;<br/>   The realistic problem is...at least if we&apos;re trying to pitch new tunings to not-already-microtonal musicians...we can safely assume they are not going to repeatedly listen to such pieces on repeat to &quot;get their ears used to them&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=89529 href="#89529">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2010 9:29:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here is an actual piece I&apos;m working on in that tuning with the same chords.</p><p><a href="http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=268">http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=268</a></p><p>or online play</p><p><a href="http://notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=289&p=2016#p2016">http://notonlymusic.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=289&p=2016#p2016</a></p></div><h3><a id=89530 href="#89530">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2010 9:45:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I don&apos;t find a zurna in Ethno 2 - could it possibly have a different<br/>name?

I wrote a longer response but I realized it all boiled down to this: F*** the &quot;general public&quot;, F*** &quot;pure intervals&quot;, and F*** trying to &quot;pitch&quot; microtonal music to an audience which, by definition, only likes things similar to what it is used to.  You&apos;re a fool if you think ANYTHING different than 12-tET will ever appeal to as many people in this culture as 12-tET does.  Microtonal music is made BY and FOR people who like things *because* they sound different, which is the diametric opposite of the &quot;general public&quot;.  The same things that make microtonal music UNAPPEALING to the &quot;general public&quot; are those that make it appealing to most of us here.</p><p>You&apos;ve painted yourself into a paradox by trying to find something that sounds exactly like 12-tET but completely different.  Nothing meets your standards because your standards are full of self-contradictions and I don&apos;t know why you don&apos;t see that.  People on this list have thrown you scale after scale, showing you the absolute best alternatives to diatonic music, and you&apos;ve rejected them all as &quot;not good enough&quot; because they all sound too different from 12-tET.  When are you going to wake up and realize that YOU just DON&apos;T LIKE MICROTONAL MUSIC, and that you should just stick with 12-tET because nothing else is gonna meet your criteria?  Stop using &quot;I haven&apos;t found the RIGHT scale&quot; as an excuse for your own compositional laziness.</p></div><h3><a id=89534 href="#89534">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2010 10:50:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;You&apos;re a fool if you think ANYTHING different than 12-tET will ever<br/>appeal to as many people in this culture as 12-tET does.&quot;</p><p>   I&apos;ve often released micro-tonal tracks WITHOUT telling people they are micro-tonal and gotten similar responses to my 12TET tracks.  The only &quot;rule&quot; I follow is to keep the average level of resolve about the same as my 12TET songs.  I do that by using scales where it&apos;s hard to go too sour...but it can also be done by smartly picking sweet chords from larger scales, holding the more dissonant notes for shorter durations, and such.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The same things that make microtonal music UNAPPEALING to the &quot;general<br/>public&quot; are those that make it appealing to most of us here.  &quot;<br/>  To some yes, but to most...I seriously doubt it.  Carl summed good temperament up by discussing maximizing the number of fairly pure dyads and minimizing the tuning error.  Come to think of it 12TET does that, but so do loads of micro-tonal scales.<br/>  (anyone on the list please answer...)<br/>Isn&apos;t it true that many of you turn to micro-tonal music for<br/>A) Tonal flexibility<br/>B) Improved consonance for certain chords<br/>C) Easy ways to quickly find out how resolved a chord is (often via JI)<br/>D) To understand what current tuning systems grew from?<br/>...none of which are contradictory to what 12TET does.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You&apos;ve painted yourself into a paradox by trying to find something that<br/>sounds exactly like 12-tET but completely different.&quot;<br/>   Something need not sound like 12TET to maintain a similar sense of resolve to 12TET...in the same way a color need not be bright blue to qualify as a bright color.<br/>  True, you are likely going to run into some intervals from 12TET...but also many (say, a good 30% or more) that aren&apos;t.  This is true of Wilson&apos;s MOS scales, the 7-tone scales from Gene&apos;s 31TET survey, and several other systems.</p><p>&gt;&quot;When are you going to wake up and realize that YOU just DON&apos;T LIKE<br/>MICROTONAL MUSIC&quot;</p><p>  I already compose about 70% of my music micro-tonally regardless of what &quot;style&quot; I&apos;m going for.  And two of my favorite electronic musicians EVER are Marcus Satellite and Sevish...despite the micro-tonal musicianship world has maybe 1 ten thousandth (or less) as many artists as the 12TET professional music world.</p><p>   The reason I got INTO micro-tonal music in the first place is I wanted to make large chords that were impossible to do in 12TET.  I was already known to push the harmonic bounds of 12TET with odd chords on the edge of consonance for the sake of a sense of musical mystique.  It came to the point where I had trouble not playing, say, the same few 6 to 7-tone chords I found that worked well every song...I wanted to do more than repeat myself.<br/>  And when I heard what Sethares was doing with Ten Strings and Blue Dabo Girl I just thought &quot;wow...now that is the kind of thing I was trying for...finally, something fresh&quot;!</p><p>&gt;&quot;Stop using &quot;I haven&apos;t found<br/>the RIGHT scale&quot; as an excuse for your own compositional laziness.&quot;<br/>  Only fools compose when not inspired.  For the longest time I composed 2-3 songs per week.  When people reviewed my songs they would VERY often say &quot;this sounds like a forced academic exercise...the technique is there but the soul isn&apos;t&quot;.  Now I compose more like one a month...but the quality per song is much better because I only compose when I&apos;m inspired and ratings and listener response are much better as well.  I released a track for Sevish&apos;s album and I&apos;m confident it will do quite well (so much for compositional laziness).  Meanwhile I see (for example) you have a lot of albums, but maybe 4 of every 18 songs per album of yours really strike me as sounding inspired...so I see that sort of thing as &quot;really&quot; producing 4 songs, and not 18.</p><p>   I refuse to treat music making like an assembly-line job.  Scale making, meanwhile, revolves enough around math and fixed logic that I can make progress on it regardless of inspiration (much like I can with computer programming).  Hence I stick with scale-making when I&apos;m not inspired to make music...and when I do make music (perhaps unlike yourself)...I don&apos;t always feel I have to release it everywhere and gloat about it to &quot;prove I compose&quot;.</p><p>   Also, for the record, I haven&apos;t as you&apos;ve said really been &quot;switched tunings&quot; much recently.  For the last 4 months or so I&apos;ve basically been just making tweaks on my &quot;Infinity&quot; scale system.<br/>  I&apos;ve even taken songs I wrote with &quot;version 1&quot; of the system and put in &quot;version 5&quot; and the mood stayed the same, only became more confident (much like changing a song from 12TET to a more JI-pure version in 31TET...just really improving the basic system, not really &quot;changing it from scratch&quot;).  I&apos;m just &quot;waxing the car and cleaning the filters...not rebuilding it&quot;, at this point.</p></div><h3><a id=89538 href="#89538">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2010 2:25:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Chris and Michael,</p><p>Please let me begin by warmly thanking you, Chris, for<br/>a piece that sounded to me like a pleasant guitar<br/>improvisation with some interesting &quot;pitch bends&quot;;<br/>that&apos;s just a first impression. Really I need to<br/>listen more also more carefully, because this isn&apos;t<br/>a genre with which I&apos;m most familiar. While Oz and<br/>others have nicely described what a zurna is (an<br/>instrument I remember hearing on some recordings<br/>maybe around the early 1970&apos;s), this doesn&apos;t of<br/>course prevent the use of this tuning with any<br/>instrument that seems apt.</p><p>I realize that often a given scale is a kind of<br/>litmus test as how to one&apos;s musical language or<br/>languages parse a given set of pitches into<br/>potential progressions. You were very helpful to<br/>provide the text file with a list of interval sizes,<br/>so that we can share ideas about some of the roads<br/>open with this &quot;zurna&quot; tuning set.</p><p>One idea that immediately occurs to me is a progression<br/>using that near-just 7/4 at 967.270 cents -- or also<br/>the slighter wider interval at 979.680 cents -- along<br/>with the great smallish neutral second and sixth at<br/>136.058 and 838.012 cents, quite close to 13/12 and 13/8.</p><p>   967  838<br/>   698  838<br/>    0   136</p><p>The first, more active chord has a 698-cent fifth plus our<br/>near 7/4, with a near-7/6 minor third between the two upper<br/>voices, close to 4:6:7. Then the lower two voices each moves<br/>up by about a 13:12 (139 cents), 136 or 140 cents; while the<br/>highest voice moves down by about a 14:13 (128 cents),<br/>129 cents, bringing us to a pure 3:2 fifth.</p><p>Of course, I see this because it has been a familiar<br/>progression for me since around late 2001, when George<br/>Secor and I explored his 17-note well-temperament and<br/>came upon many things like this. It might or not fit in<br/>the direction you decide to take a given piece.</p><p>Thank you also, Michael, for offering your frank opinion<br/>and raising some general philosophical questions. I might<br/>offer a few quick responses.</p><p>What you may be highlighing is a composer&apos;s dilemma in<br/>many genres: will something sound like a subtle and<br/>pleasing variation on a familiar musical language; a<br/>&quot;mistake&quot; where a familiar language seems to be spoken<br/>with a &quot;wrong accent&quot;; or an invitation to explore some<br/>new or at least unfamiliar language for a given listener?</p><p>To me, &quot;microtonality&quot; isn&apos;t a genre, but rather a dimension<br/>of any music with pitch: and 12-EDO is simply one tuning<br/>within that continuum. In my view there are no good, or more<br/>particularly bad, intervals in themselves, but rather<br/>intervals presented in more or less fitting or unfitting<br/>contexts. You wouldn&apos;t necessarily want to use an excellent<br/>slendro tuning for a church organ playing Palestrina, or<br/>tune a gender playing slendro in 1/4-comma meantone (or<br/>12-EDO for that matter) -- maybe Yarman-79 would offer a<br/>nice subset.</p><p>Consider, for example, one of the most popular and successful<br/>performers of the 20th century, still loved by millions and<br/>a cultural icon to many: Umm Kulthum. Did she call herself a<br/>&quot;microtonalist&quot;? Can her music be reduced to 12-EDO -- or,<br/>for that matter, to a regular 12-note Pythagorean or meantone<br/>tuning, or a 12-note well-temperament of the Bach era?</p><p>Someone might rightly point out that every note she sang was<br/>necessarily no more than 50 cents from some step of 12-equal,<br/>and that statement also applies to my music, or Chris&apos;s, or<br/>anyone else&apos;s. We&apos;re not out to be as similar to or different<br/>as possible from one good system out there along the interval<br/>spectrum, but rather to &quot;do our thing&quot; as relevant traditions,<br/>preferences, and sometimes sheer inspiration move us.</p><p>In short: thanks to Chris for a pleasant piece I need to<br/>listen to more carefully, with a due confession that I&apos;m<br/>not so familiar with this kind of genre; and to Michael<br/>for asking some questions providing much food for thought.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=89539 href="#89539">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2010 2:52:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Look, dude.

You&apos;re never satisfied with any scale, and you dismiss nearly every scale suggested to you.</p><p>But now you say you DO like some scales, and you DO think there is some good microtonal music out there, and you claim that you ARE making music.  So maybe there ARE scales and musicians that have met your stringent criteria, and you just don&apos;t like to talk about them?  I just don&apos;t know.  If you ever go back and re-read your posts, you&apos;ll see that just about EVERY SINGLE POST you make, it&apos;s all &quot;well this is kind of okay, but still not good enough&quot;.</p><p>Regarding output: everything I write is in the framework of a concept album, so yeah, some songs aren&apos;t quite as inspired because they have a role to fill and I have to keep them in that role, rather than following whatever direction I want to go in.  Had &quot;Map of an Internal Landscape&quot; NOT had the concept behind it, I would have taken those tunings in much different directions probably.  It was an exercise in trying to associate EDOs with mental states.  &quot;Early Microtonal Works&quot; is about half improvised, very unpolished.  But everyone seems to like different songs on those albums, which is a testament to the fact that what I consider my best work is not a reliable indicator of how it will go over.  So I write, release, and let the audience judge.</p><p>As to your output, the only music I&apos;ve EVER heard from you are those two examples of 19-tET stuff you linked me to quite a while back, and the occasional 4-bar snippet of something your working on.  Where are you hiding all this music you claim to have made?  It&apos;s easy to criticize others when no one gets to hear what YOU&apos;VE been making.</p><p>Aaaand, I still maintain that anything which sounds significantly different from 12-tET will NEVER be as popular in our culture as 12-tET.  No matter how &quot;consonant&quot; or &quot;resolved&quot; it sounds.  Because most people in our culture DON&apos;T LIKE &quot;DIFFERENT&quot;.  Some people, maybe your friends or anyone adventurous enough to find your work, might find it &quot;interesting&quot;, but come on...is Joe Lunchbox driving his pickup through the Heartland gonna dig it?  Is Donna Preteen with her boyband posters and Tiger Beat magazine gonna dig it?  Is the Carlos Hendrix-Ray-Vaughn psych-blues cover band go out and refret their guitars to it?  Is Betty Soccermom gonna blast it on her minivan stereo on the way to pick up the kids?  I think the answer is a resounding NO, and not just for your work, but for ALL of ours.  It&apos;s people like these little archetypes that drive the market, and NONE OF THEM could give a damn about microtonal music.  If you think otherwise, you&apos;re really fooling yourself.</p></div><h3><a id=89541 href="#89541">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2010 3:26:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;or<br/>about how you don&apos;t like the scale used in someone&apos;s piece&quot;<br/>  Admittedly I think a whole bunch of scales either sound profoundly like 12TET or just plain old lack any sort of easy resolve.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You spend most of your time here talking about how this scale or<br/>that<br/>scale isn&apos;t gonna &quot;sell&quot; micro-tonal music to the average listener&quot;<br/>   Yes...because if we actually want to grow this art beyond being mostly &quot;fringe hobby&quot; for those in musical academics...we need to get real, professional musicians interested.  Neil Haverstick has said very similar things many times...for example.  That&apos;s not me trying to push all toward MTV and major label (Lord forbid...I hate both)...but dealing with the reality that we&apos;re not getting too far at getting many musicians to try our art here and the fact it&apos;s hurting the scene. Less musicians in micro-tonallity = less micro-tonal music.  It&apos;s not rocket science.</p><p>&gt;&quot;and you&apos;re<br/>just constantly talking like there&apos;s no good micro-tonal music out there.&quot;<br/>   I just mentioned Marcus and Sevish.

Yes I do often say work here sounds a bit self-indulgent and not considering any type of wider audience...because, again, I see that as a problem keeping this art from reaching more musicians.</p><p>&gt;&quot;But now you say you DO like some scales, and you DO think there is some<br/>good microtonal music out there, and you claim that you ARE making<br/>music.&quot;<br/>  Have made music for a long time.  I&apos;ve posted about 4 songs on here.  You really need to know the honest reason I don&apos;t post a whole lot of songs?  I don&apos;t think I&apos;m that great a composer, period...and I&apos;ve been composing for over 10 years...so I think my time is best off composing example and making tunings for the sake of making things easier for those WITH such skills...instead of becoming the &quot;breakthrough artist&quot; I&apos;ve well realized I will never be.  Come to think of it, Carl, Rick, Marcel, and a handful of others don&apos;t release a lot of music either...are you going to bully them as well?</p><p>&gt;&quot;you&apos;ll see that just about EVERY SINGLE POST you make, it&apos;s all &quot;well<br/>this is kind of okay, but still not good enough&quot;.&quot;<br/>   The only time it will truly be good enough...is when the musical world sees microtonality as a more-or-less equally strong art to &quot;regular&quot; music.  It&apos;s an ongoing process, not a goal...kind of like curing cancer.</p><p>&gt;&quot;As to your output, the only music I&apos;ve EVER heard from you are those two examples of 19-tET stuff you linked me to quite a while back, and the<br/>occasional 4-bar snippet of something your working on.  Where are you<br/>hiding all this music you claim to have made?  It&apos;s easy to criticize<br/>others when no one gets to hear what YOU&apos;VE been making.&quot;<br/>   I&apos;ve also linked to my old song &quot;Sutrated&quot;, which is also micro-tonal.  Dare I say it...I think Sutrated and my 19TET piece &quot;Melancholy and Yellow&quot; are pretty solid, though no where near good enough to change people&apos;s minds about micro-tonallity.  Also I will gladly link to my new song on Sevish&apos;s album WHEN he releases it.  Granted also, a lot of my music I don&apos;t consider good enough to release.  In addition, I&apos;ve never claimed to make a ton of music in the first place.  You don&apos;t have to have made 100+ songs to call yourself a composer, do you?</p><p>&gt;&quot;Aaaand, I still maintain that anything which sounds significantly<br/>different from 12-tET will NEVER be as popular in our culture as 12-tET. No matter how &quot;consonant&quot; or &quot;resolved&quot; it sounds.  Because most<br/>people in our culture DON&apos;T LIKE &quot;DIFFERENT&quot;.  &quot;<br/>   I seriously doubt it.  There used to be no such thing as new-school hip hop and the original 303 that drives so much dance music was original supposed to be just a stand in for a rock bassist...drum and bass used to never exist and sounds dramatically different than anything before it, and now people love both of those &quot;crazy new genres&quot;.  Music has also become more dissonant over time throughout history...though not by huge jumps.  Somewhat inharmonic timbres have even become the norm in many genres of electronica and people pay thousands for analog synths often for the sole purpose of making weird sounds and effects.</p><p>  Considering how much difference people have gradually welcomed in music...I don&apos;t see why there&apos;s a so-called anti-difference barrier that one effects tuning...especially when they accept drastic changes in everything else.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Some people, maybe your friends or anyone adventurous enough to find<br/>your work, might find it &quot;interesting&quot;, but come on...is Joe Lunchbox<br/>driving his pickup through the Heartland gonna dig it?  Is Donna Preteen with her boyband posters and Tiger Beat magazine gonna dig it?&quot;</p><p>  Uh dude...the point is to get everyday MUSICIANS to take micro-tonal seriously enough to actually compose in it.  I don&apos;t care about Tiger Beat or any marketing garbage like that.  My point is that if you can&apos;t make an average pro musician take your musical art seriously your &quot;art&quot; is in trouble.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I think the answer is a resounding NO, and not just for your work, but<br/>for ALL of ours.  It&apos;s people like these little archetypes that drive<br/>the market, and NONE OF THEM could give a damn about microtonal music.<br/>If you think otherwise, you&apos;re really fooling yourself.  &quot;</p><p>  Sad thing, I don&apos;t consider myself a good composer...and yet even I&apos;ve had local DJ&apos;s play some of my microtonal tracks live and get average response playing it right along with 12TET music.  But I&apos;ve shown them other micro-tonal work...and they won&apos;t touch 98% of it...and when I ask for the reasons they give much the same ones I give here.  If a somewhat lousy composer like myself can manage...then I swear others, if they could spare maybe even one song out of every 20 they write to make a respectable public impression, could convince both professional DJs and live musicians to take micro-tonal seriously.  But, you&apos;re right...most people think it&apos;s just a circus.</p><p>  And your (and often others&apos;) apparent attitude of &quot;they will never give a damn...let&apos;s not even try...let&apos;s just do whatever we&apos;re doing and wait another 100+ years until they come to us&quot; I swear...is helping making sure micro-tonal music is never respected in the greater world the way it deserves to be.</p><p>  At least I&apos;m trying to make scales to help fill in that gap between micro-tonality and the rest of the music world and convince more musicians to join our art...I just can&apos;t believe the hypocrisy that people like you are making fun of me and calling me pathetic for trying to HELP out here by getting us all some more recognition...</p></div><h3><a id=89542 href="#89542">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2010 3:48:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Did you try Shenai?

Really I need to<br/>&gt; listen more also more carefully, because this isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; a genre with which I&apos;m most familiar. While Oz and<br/>&gt; others have nicely described what a zurna is (an<br/>&gt; instrument I remember hearing on some recordings<br/>&gt; maybe around the early 1970&apos;s), this doesn&apos;t of<br/>&gt; course prevent the use of this tuning with any<br/>&gt; instrument that seems apt.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I realize that often a given scale is a kind of<br/>&gt; litmus test as how to one&apos;s musical language or<br/>&gt; languages parse a given set of pitches into<br/>&gt; potential progressions. You were very helpful to<br/>&gt; provide the text file with a list of interval sizes,<br/>&gt; so that we can share ideas about some of the roads<br/>&gt; open with this &quot;zurna&quot; tuning set.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One idea that immediately occurs to me is a progression<br/>&gt; using that near-just 7/4 at 967.270 cents -- or also<br/>&gt; the slighter wider interval at 979.680 cents -- along<br/>&gt; with the great smallish neutral second and sixth at<br/>&gt; 136.058 and 838.012 cents, quite close to 13/12 and 13/8.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 967 838<br/>&gt; 698 838<br/>&gt; 0 136<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first, more active chord has a 698-cent fifth plus our<br/>&gt; near 7/4, with a near-7/6 minor third between the two upper<br/>&gt; voices, close to 4:6:7. Then the lower two voices each moves<br/>&gt; up by about a 13:12 (139 cents), 136 or 140 cents; while the<br/>&gt; highest voice moves down by about a 14:13 (128 cents),<br/>&gt; 129 cents, bringing us to a pure 3:2 fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, I see this because it has been a familiar<br/>&gt; progression for me since around late 2001, when George<br/>&gt; Secor and I explored his 17-note well-temperament and<br/>&gt; came upon many things like this. It might or not fit in<br/>&gt; the direction you decide to take a given piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you also, Michael, for offering your frank opinion<br/>&gt; and raising some general philosophical questions. I might<br/>&gt; offer a few quick responses.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What you may be highlighing is a composer&apos;s dilemma in<br/>&gt; many genres: will something sound like a subtle and<br/>&gt; pleasing variation on a familiar musical language; a<br/>&gt; &quot;mistake&quot; where a familiar language seems to be spoken<br/>&gt; with a &quot;wrong accent&quot;; or an invitation to explore some<br/>&gt; new or at least unfamiliar language for a given listener?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To me, &quot;microtonality&quot; isn&apos;t a genre, but rather a dimension<br/>&gt; of any music with pitch: and 12-EDO is simply one tuning<br/>&gt; within that continuum. In my view there are no good, or more<br/>&gt; particularly bad, intervals in themselves, but rather<br/>&gt; intervals presented in more or less fitting or unfitting<br/>&gt; contexts. You wouldn&apos;t necessarily want to use an excellent<br/>&gt; slendro tuning for a church organ playing Palestrina, or<br/>&gt; tune a gender playing slendro in 1/4-comma meantone (or<br/>&gt; 12-EDO for that matter) -- maybe Yarman-79 would offer a<br/>&gt; nice subset.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consider, for example, one of the most popular and successful<br/>&gt; performers of the 20th century, still loved by millions and<br/>&gt; a cultural icon to many: Umm Kulthum. Did she call herself a<br/>&gt; &quot;microtonalist&quot;? Can her music be reduced to 12-EDO -- or,<br/>&gt; for that matter, to a regular 12-note Pythagorean or meantone<br/>&gt; tuning, or a 12-note well-temperament of the Bach era?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Someone might rightly point out that every note she sang was<br/>&gt; necessarily no more than 50 cents from some step of 12-equal,<br/>&gt; and that statement also applies to my music, or Chris&apos;s, or<br/>&gt; anyone else&apos;s. We&apos;re not out to be as similar to or different<br/>&gt; as possible from one good system out there along the interval<br/>&gt; spectrum, but rather to &quot;do our thing&quot; as relevant traditions,<br/>&gt; preferences, and sometimes sheer inspiration move us.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In short: thanks to Chris for a pleasant piece I need to<br/>&gt; listen to more carefully, with a due confession that I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not so familiar with this kind of genre; and to Michael<br/>&gt; for asking some questions providing much food for thought.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most appreciatively,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a> &lt;mschulter%<a href="http://40calweb.com">40calweb.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=89547 href="#89547">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2010 12:41:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well Michael, if you like so many scales and you like so much microtonal music, why AREN&apos;T you out pitching music to &quot;professional quality&quot; musicians?  And if you ARE doing that, why aren&apos;t they biting, eh?</p><p>Oh, but if you&apos;re wondering what microtonality in the hands of a major-label band (you know, with pro-quality production and international distribution) looks like, google &quot;Massive Audio Nerve&quot;.  I don&apos;t like it, but it&apos;s definitely mainstream.  They even have a professional video!  The scale?  Quarter-tones.  Is this the sort of thing you want to see?</p><p>As to why I don&apos;t f*** with Carl or Marcel for not making music: Carl&apos;s a walking encyclopedia, his knowledge dwarfs all but a select few of the members here, and he does an awful lot to support the community.  He also makes mostly positive and helpful comments, and keeps the negativity to a minimum, and he owns up to the fact that his preferences are his own ONLY.  He&apos;d certainly never discourage anyone from making music in any scale, either, even if he personally didn&apos;t like it.  Marcel, that dude&apos;s on his own trip and he&apos;s only interested in analyzing and tuning one specific form of music, and is content to let anyone working outside that form &quot;live and let live&quot;.  I&apos;ve never heard him bash someone for NOT using 5-limit JI in an original piece.</p><p>But you, Michael...you&apos;re not shy about criticizing peoples&apos; approaches for failing to &quot;sell&quot; microtonality.  Why?  If you want to sell microtonality, then sell it.  But don&apos;t get all high and mighty about the people on this list using tunings you don&apos;t like or (&quot;Bob&quot; forbid) being too &quot;selfish&quot; to try to pretty up their music into a form that&apos;ll sell to John Q. Public.  We all have our own reasons for using microtonality...I&apos;d say every one of us probably has a different reason.  You think we should all be &quot;doing our part&quot; to sell microtonality, as if making bad/uninspired music is somehow a detriment to this project and people should be ashamed of themselves for posting music that doesn&apos;t adhere to your standards.  Sure, you never say &quot;this sucks&quot;, because you hide behind &quot;the average musician&quot;--&quot;oh, I think this chord is alright, but the average musician wouldn&apos;t like it.&quot;  What makes you so sure you can speak for &quot;the average musician&quot;?</p><p>If you want to criticize me for not doing &quot;enough&quot; for the movement, you have no right.  I&apos;ve picked &quot;alternative EDOs&quot; as my &quot;cause&quot; and I&apos;m doing a hell of a lot to make these tunings known to the masses.  In another month I&apos;ll have a primer, written in plain English using terms that any musician can understand, which explains and describes the properties, potential applications, and my subjective impressions of every EDO from 5 to 37, which will be freely available electronically to anyone who wants it.  I don&apos;t see anyone else (save for the Just Intonation Network) trying to make microtonal theory so accessible as this.  Let&apos;s not forget that I&apos;ve already made a CD of fairly accessible music demonstrating EDOs 9 to 27, which may be a bit &quot;uninspired&quot; but hey, at least it might give people some ideas of what&apos;s possible.  If you think I could be doing &quot;more&quot; with the modest resources I have available, I&apos;d love to hear it.  What have you done?  Come up with a few scales, written a few songs, and spent an awful lot of time criticizing the efforts of others.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;or<br/>&gt; about how you don&apos;t like the scale used in someone&apos;s piece&quot;<br/>&gt;   Admittedly I think a whole bunch of scales either sound profoundly like 12TET or just plain old lack any sort of easy resolve.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;You spend most of your time here talking about how this scale or<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; scale isn&apos;t gonna &quot;sell&quot; micro-tonal music to the average listener&quot;<br/>&gt;    Yes...because if we actually want to grow this art beyond being mostly &quot;fringe hobby&quot; for those in musical academics...we need to get real, professional musicians interested.

Yes I do often say work here sounds a bit self-indulgent and not considering any type of wider audience...because, again, I see that as a problem keeping this art from reaching more musicians.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;But now you say you DO like some scales, and you DO think there is some<br/>&gt; good microtonal music out there, and you claim that you ARE making<br/>&gt; music.&quot;<br/>&gt;   Have made music for a long time.  I&apos;ve posted about 4 songs on here.  You really need to know the honest reason I don&apos;t post a whole lot of songs?  I don&apos;t think I&apos;m that great a composer, period...and I&apos;ve been composing for over 10 years...so I think my time is best off composing example and making tunings for the sake of making things easier for those WITH such skills...instead of becoming the &quot;breakthrough artist&quot; I&apos;ve well realized I will never be.  Come to think of it, Carl, Rick, Marcel, and a handful of others don&apos;t release a lot of music either...are you going to bully them as well?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;you&apos;ll see that just about EVERY SINGLE POST you make, it&apos;s all &quot;well<br/>&gt; this is kind of okay, but still not good enough&quot;.&quot;<br/>&gt;    The only time it will truly be good enough...is when the musical world sees microtonality as a more-or-less equally strong art to &quot;regular&quot; music.  It&apos;s an ongoing process, not a goal...kind of like curing cancer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;As to your output, the only music I&apos;ve EVER heard from you are those two examples of 19-tET stuff you linked me to quite a while back, and the<br/>&gt; occasional 4-bar snippet of something your working on.  Where are you<br/>&gt; hiding all this music you claim to have made?  It&apos;s easy to criticize<br/>&gt; others when no one gets to hear what YOU&apos;VE been making.&quot;<br/>&gt;    I&apos;ve also linked to my old song &quot;Sutrated&quot;, which is also micro-tonal.  Dare I say it...I think Sutrated and my 19TET piece &quot;Melancholy and Yellow&quot; are pretty solid, though no where near good enough to change people&apos;s minds about micro-tonallity.  Also I will gladly link to my new song on Sevish&apos;s album WHEN he releases it.  Granted also, a lot of my music I don&apos;t consider good enough to release.  In addition, I&apos;ve never claimed to make a ton of music in the first place.  You don&apos;t have to have made 100+ songs to call yourself a composer, do you?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Aaaand, I still maintain that anything which sounds significantly<br/>&gt; different from 12-tET will NEVER be as popular in our culture as 12-tET. No matter how &quot;consonant&quot; or &quot;resolved&quot; it sounds.  Because most<br/>&gt; people in our culture DON&apos;T LIKE &quot;DIFFERENT&quot;.  &quot;<br/>&gt;    I seriously doubt it.  There used to be no such thing as new-school hip hop and the original 303 that drives so much dance music was original supposed to be just a stand in for a rock bassist...drum and bass used to never exist and sounds dramatically different than anything before it, and now people love both of those &quot;crazy new genres&quot;.  Music has also become more dissonant over time throughout history...though not by huge jumps.  Somewhat inharmonic timbres have even become the norm in many genres of electronica and people pay thousands for analog synths often for the sole purpose of making weird sounds and effects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Considering how much difference people have gradually welcomed in music...I don&apos;t see why there&apos;s a so-called anti-difference barrier that one effects tuning...especially when they accept drastic changes in everything else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Some people, maybe your friends or anyone adventurous enough to find<br/>&gt; your work, might find it &quot;interesting&quot;, but come on...is Joe Lunchbox<br/>&gt; driving his pickup through the Heartland gonna dig it?  Is Donna Preteen with her boyband posters and Tiger Beat magazine gonna dig it?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Uh dude...the point is to get everyday MUSICIANS to take micro-tonal seriously enough to actually compose in it.  I don&apos;t care about Tiger Beat or any marketing garbage like that.  My point is that if you can&apos;t make an average pro musician take your musical art seriously your &quot;art&quot; is in trouble.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;I think the answer is a resounding NO, and not just for your work, but<br/>&gt; for ALL of ours.  It&apos;s people like these little archetypes that drive<br/>&gt; the market, and NONE OF THEM could give a damn about microtonal music.<br/>&gt; If you think otherwise, you&apos;re really fooling yourself.  &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Sad thing, I don&apos;t consider myself a good composer...and yet even I&apos;ve had local DJ&apos;s play some of my microtonal tracks live and get average response playing it right along with 12TET music.  But I&apos;ve shown them other micro-tonal work...and they won&apos;t touch 98% of it...and when I ask for the reasons they give much the same ones I give here.  If a somewhat lousy composer like myself can manage...then I swear others, if they could spare maybe even one song out of every 20 they write to make a respectable public impression, could convince both professional DJs and live musicians to take micro-tonal seriously.  But, you&apos;re right...most people think it&apos;s just a circus.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   And your (and often others&apos;) apparent attitude of &quot;they will never give a damn...let&apos;s not even try...let&apos;s just do whatever we&apos;re doing and wait another 100+ years until they come to us&quot; I swear...is helping making sure micro-tonal music is never respected in the greater world the way it deserves to be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   At least I&apos;m trying to make scales to help fill in that gap between micro-tonality and the rest of the music world and convince more musicians to join our art...I just can&apos;t believe the hypocrisy that people like you are making fun of me and calling me pathetic for trying to HELP out here by getting us all some more recognition...<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=89549 href="#89549">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2010 2:22:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In another month I&apos;ll have a primer, written in plain English using terms that any musician can understand, which explains and describes the properties, potential applications, and my subjective impressions of every EDO from 5 to 37, which will be freely available electronically to anyone who wants it.</p><p>Will we be able to quote from it on the Xenwiki?

And if you ARE doing that, why aren&apos;t they biting, eh?&quot;<br/>  I don&apos;t know many.  But out of the five or so I do I have two &quot;bites&quot; IE people interested who are currently trying to figure out how to work the software to make micro-tonal music.<br/>  Most of the &quot;personal opinions&quot; I state hear about things like concordance echo from those &quot;bites&quot;.  I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s the only way to attract professional musicians...but I am saying it as, to say the least, one valid way to do that IE to make or show them scales with<br/>A) Resolved-sound chords being as easy to find as in 12TET<br/>B) Similar number of chords (or greater) available as in 12TET<br/>C) Not a ridiculously high amount of tones per octave for the musician to keep track of and/or map to an instrument<br/>.....indeed many of the same criteria you have mentioned before and I wholeheartedly agree with you on.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Oh, but if you&apos;re wondering what micro-tonality in the hands of a<br/>major-label band (you know, with pro-quality production and<br/>international distribution) looks like, google &quot;Massive Audio Nerve&quot;.&quot;<br/>   Hate to burst your bubble but...not good.  Its sounds represents many of the reasons people don&apos;t take micro-tonal seriously: it has a ton of noise and almost aims to sound chaotic.  I know there has been a lot of talk of metal/micro-tonal collaborations...which I don&apos;t think along is a bad idea...but most of what has come out (at least that I&apos;ve heard) sounds more like Tool than more musically involved (and considered much more classic/legendary) things like Metallica&apos;s old tunes.  I&apos;m not saying &quot;argh, let&apos;s get rid of it&quot;...but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to help much.</p><p>  We can do better...much better.  Again I&apos;m going to allude to Neil Haverstick&apos;s music...because he&apos;s one of the few who manages to balance micro-tonal guitar playing in such a way it sound both distinctly different than 12TET and well thought out enough that most musicians I&apos;ve gotten the chance to show it to take it seriously.  I can easily see why Guitar World (which is definitely NOT Teen Beat, lol) took him seriously as well.</p><p>&gt;&quot;But you, Michael...you&apos;re not shy about criticizing peoples&apos; approaches<br/>for failing to &quot;sell&quot; microtonality&quot;<br/>  I criticize my own and others.  I&apos;m not hear to kiss anyone else&apos;s ego or my own...I&apos;m here to get to the point where micro-tonal music is taken seriously by the musical community in general.  And I&apos;ve found I&apos;m not a bad guesser...if something comes across to my ears as too &quot;unstable&quot; most of the time when I show the work to professional musicians they echo my thoughts.  We have a lot of work to do...</p><p>  If we didn&apos;t...I&apos;d be able to happily drop by a music store or watch a movie or just walk in to a store (IE Abercrombie, Urban Outfitters, or some place that plays non-musak music) and hear micro-tonal music just about anywhere.</p><p>&gt;&quot;But don&apos;t get all high and mighty about the people on this list using<br/>tunings you don&apos;t like or (&quot;Bob&quot; forbid) being too &quot;selfish&quot; to try to<br/>pretty up their music into a form that&apos;ll sell to John Q. Public.  &quot;<br/>   There&apos;s no problem in that many of us don&apos;t do that...but I do see a huge problem in that virtually none of us do.  The only way your argument seems to be able to succeed is IF you can say I&apos;m insisting all of us &quot;go pop&quot;.  Which I&apos;m NOT.</p><p>  I&apos;m simply saying it wouldn&apos;t hurt if maybe one out of every hundred micro-tonal musicians put some serious effort into this...and do so with the mentality there may be MORE than one way to catch the public ear.  Is that really such a ridiculous thing to ask?</p><p>  Your technique seems to be separating the wheat from the chaff in TET scales while mine is making new scales that &quot;produce mostly wheat&quot;...my technique involves working on getting composers better than myself interested while your technique involves composing multitudes if music.  And, in fact, I read you article on &quot;multiple of 5&quot; TET tunings and guitars and found it quite amusing and useful.<br/>  It may well be that both of us succeed...I get better composers to use my scales and it catches the public ear, your own compositions catch the public ear and they actually start mass-producing things like 15TET guitars and selling them at my local Guitar Center store, etc.  And that would be a good thing...not some sort of terrible contradiction.</p><p>  Look; both opinions can be right and help the scene...my beef with you is you appear to keep saying that one technique of popularizing micro-tonal music MUST somehow come at the expense of another.  How about we stop this fighting and actually work in peace on forwarding our individual missions...we&apos;re both here to some extent to make micro-tonal music more accessible, right? :-)</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3><a id=89566 href="#89566">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2010 3:28:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;   Look; both opinions can be right and help the scene...my beef with you is you appear to keep saying that one technique of popularizing micro-tonal music MUST somehow come at the expense of another.

You don&apos;t have to kiss anyone&apos;s ass, but there&apos;s nothing to be accomplished by dismissing/denigrating anyone&apos;s scales or compositions.</p><p>What exactly IS your &quot;plan&quot; to sell microtonal music?  What steps are YOU taking toward this goal?  When a company wants to bring a product to market, they don&apos;t let it sit in R&amp;D forever until it&apos;s absolutely perfect; they develop it until it&apos;s good enough to sell, and then they pass it on to marketing.  I&apos;ve gotten you to admit that there are microtonal scales and bits of microtonal music that are at least &quot;good enough&quot; for you, so they&apos;re good enough to &quot;sell&quot;.  There are actually already several microtonalists out there already &quot;selling&quot; a variety of scales and approaches, while you&apos;re still bogged down in R&amp;D and babbling about how no one&apos;s trying to sell microtonality, which is just wrong:</p><p>Paul Rubenstein&apos;s out there teaching kids how to BUILD THEIR OWN MICROTONAL GUITARS from scratch in an after-school program; Elaine Walker&apos;s teaching community college students about Bohlen-Pierce, and writing amazing accessible microtonal pop music; Ron Sword started the world&apos;s first microtonal guitar company, and gives lectures and performances around the country about microtonality; XJ Scott invented a piece of software that can retune ANYTHING to ANY SCALE (though it only runs on the Mac), and runs one of the best microtonal websites on the &apos;net; Sevish started a microtonal netlabel to help distribute microtonal music, and has written (as you say) some of the absolute most accessible microtonal music ever; Andrew Heathwaite and Jacob Barton started a Wiki and a social networking site, have organized several microtonal performances in their home city, and spend a lot of time developing microtonal educational resources; Jon Catler is gigging non-stop with his JI blues band, and sells affordable microtonal guitar necks in a couple different tunings through his very slick website; Neil Haverstick continues to make excellent microtonal guitar music, has written a 19-tET guitar theory book, and has been featured in Guitar Player magazine; crikey, I could go on all day like this, I haven&apos;t even touched HALF the people who are out there really *going for it*.  So don&apos;t complain that no one&apos;s out there selling it.  That&apos;s just ignorant.  If you were half as productive as any of these people, I might take you a little more seriously, but you&apos;re not.</p><p>And what exactly do you think the Tuning List has to do with selling microtonal music to the outside world?  Just about EVERYONE I know who&apos;s actively trying to teach/preach microtonality to the uninitiated stays as FAR from this list as possible.  It&apos;s a black hole, one I keep getting sucked back into (because I&apos;m stupid like that).  Trying to sell a scale to the people here is like selling ice to Eskimos.</p><p>Seriously Michael, you need to STOP complaining about what people on this list &quot;aren&apos;t doing&quot;, because I don&apos;t see you doing it, either.  Lead by example, not by sitting in the back-seat and telling people they&apos;re driving in the wrong direction.</p></div><h3><a id=89568 href="#89568">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/27/2010 8:52:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Michael, this is exactly what I&apos;m trying to tell you: the way to<br/>&quot;forward your mission&quot; is not to spend so much energy criticizing and<br/>rejecting scales and compositions; it&apos;s to be positive and supportive<br/>of whatever good stuff emerges from this community and put your energy<br/>behind that.&quot;<br/>   If only it were that easy.  On one hand, I do see enough good micro-tonal material composed to make it worth commenting on very positively from time to time.<br/>  On the other hand, a sad majority of what I see seems to say &quot;the only way to reach the public is to simply repackage the same theories that have been around, and have failed to really make it public, for hundreds or thousands of years&quot;.  It&apos;s that attitude that seems to say &quot;things are what they are and can never be changed and barely, if ever, improved upon&quot;.<br/>  So if, say, someone releases a tune in, say, a pure pythagorean scale or a mean-tone scale while simultaneously bragging how well it follows &quot;expert methods&quot;, you bet I&apos;m going to say something about how it may well push listeners back into their anti-microtonal close-mindedness.  Because the sad fact is, I&apos;m pretty sure there ARE actually some standards in micro-tonality that largely result in the putting down of any new options.  It&apos;s that kind of thing, that often encourages people to, say, see JI as the only way to tune well as bitch out those who don&apos;t agree...in the same way people addicted to 12TET often bitch out those who do anything different than 12TET.</p><p>&gt;&quot;What exactly IS your &quot;plan&quot; to sell microtonal music?&quot;  What steps are YOU taking toward this goal?<br/>A path is as follows<br/>A)  Make several simple musical examples that show ways scales can be used which 12TET can&apos;t be used (IE those 7-30 second clips I often make).  Don&apos;t push toward a certain style that singles certain types of musicians out or make them think &quot;oh it&apos;s only useful for X type of music IE metal or neo-classic&quot;...just give basic examples that can apply to any type of music.<br/>  Also show them examples from musicians across various genres in various scales...again being careful not to allow them to think micro-tonal is only useful for certain genres.<br/>B) Show the examples to as many professional musicians as possible.<br/>C) Help them get set up with micro-tonal software and, when possible, micro-tonal instruments.  If you can&apos;t actually sit down with them to help, at least write tutorials.<br/>D) Help them with compositional tips and/or making situations the make it easier for them to play by-ear.  Such was the idea with my &quot;Infinity&quot; scale system (which was designed to be an &quot;easiest of the easy&quot; approach)...though I also recommend other systems such as Ptolemic scales and sub-sets of TET tunings that leave few sour combinations.  Not because they can&apos;t do more...but to make starting efforts as easy as possible before they move on the trickier stuff.<br/>*********************************<br/>   I have done A and B with about 3 musicians and am currently working with one new-to-microtonal professional musician at C.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve gotten you to admit that there are microtonal scales and bits of<br/>microtonal music that are at least &quot;good enough&quot; for you, so they&apos;re<br/>good enough to &quot;sell&quot;.

Too often I run into clicks...things like micro-tonalist who seem to voice things like that neo-classical is the only real way to do micro-tonality and anyone who doesn&apos;t like it doesn&apos;t like it because they are too dumb to understand true excellence...stuff like that.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Paul Rubenstein&apos;s out there teaching kids how to BUILD THEIR OWN MICROTONAL GUITARS from scratch in an after-school program&quot;<br/>   Not going to argue, that&apos;s awesome.<br/>&gt;&quot;Elaine Walker&apos;s teaching community college students about Bohlen-Pierce, and writing amazing accessible microtonal pop music;&quot;<br/>   Not going to lie, I consider that a bit mixed in its net effect.  This is because I figure favoritism of BP could easily lead to single-standard-ism much like that in 12TET...not to mention the way BP is based on triads very much makes it work &quot;like 12TET but for odd harmonic instruments&quot;.  I&apos;d say the same for someone trying to promote almost solely meantone or JI diatonic guitars, for example.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Sevish started a microtonal netlabel to help distribute microtonal<br/>music, and has written (as you say) some of the absolute most<br/>accessible microtonal music ever;&quot;<br/>  I wouldn&apos;t 100% agree after talking to him...though I will say his music, along with music from a few artists on his label such as Jacky Ligon and Carlo Serafani (sp.), really are incredibly accessible even from the very first listen.  Also I release music under his label and rarely ever get into any sort of nasty battles.  He&apos;s one of the few people who truly seems to understand and value my approach...but, more importantly, he runs one of the few labels I have managed to get any professional musicians across genres to take seriously as more than just an academic endeavor.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Andrew Heathwaite and Jacob Barton started a Wiki and a social<br/>networking site, have organized several microtonal performances in<br/>their home city, and spend a lot of time developing microtonal<br/>educational resources;&quot;<br/>  Admirable effort.  One thing to note is there are TONS of micro-tonal resources...but very few toned down enough for the average musician to have the patience to learn.  I haven&apos;t seen there site yet...so I don&apos;t know if it has that problem or not but, for sure, many Doctorate-level papers and guides out on micro-tonality scream &quot;harsh learning curve ahead&quot; for even very skilled musicians.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Jon Catler is gigging non-stop with his JI blues<br/>band, and sells affordable micro-tonal guitar necks in a couple<br/>different tunings through his very slick website;&quot;<br/>   Sounds great...assuming there are no &quot;JI is the only true way to do micro-tonality&quot; under-lyings.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Neil Haverstick<br/>continues to make excellent microtonal guitar music, has written a<br/>19-tET guitar theory book, and has been featured in Guitar Player<br/>magazine; crikey, I could go on all day like this&quot;<br/>  Now that just pissed me off as &gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt; gave him direct credit for this last message (including the Guitar Player article part), and now you&apos;re re-introducing him as if I hadn&apos;t said a thing.  That&apos;s just purely ignorant on your behalf at best and just plain cruel at worst.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I haven&apos;t even<br/>touched HALF the people who are out there really *going for it*. So<br/>don&apos;t complain that no one&apos;s out there selling it. That&apos;s just<br/>ignorant. If you were half as productive as any of these people, I<br/>might take you a little more seriously, but you&apos;re not.&quot;<br/>    Great, now you somehow know everything I&apos;ve done without asking me.  But here it is anyhow.  I have not one but two DJ&apos;s playing micro-tonal music at major clubs in Houston, Texas...and that isn&apos;t 25 or so person avant-garde fringe shows it&apos;s 75+ person live venues.  I have made my own tracks as well played in such venues.  I have one local professional guitarist on his way to composing micro-tonal music on his MIDI keyboard.  I have had an article about micro-tonal music published in a university magazine featuring links to people like Neil.  Plus I, much like people such as you and Elaine, have released pop-focused micro-tonal music of my own.</p><p>  And...just because I don&apos;t make huge websites or my own guitars or have a live pop group (like Elaine does) doesn&apos;t mean my efforts are trash.  Heck, far as I&apos;ve read, you don&apos;t do those things either.  No apologies.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And what exactly do you think the Tuning List has to do with selling<br/>microtonal music to the outside world?&quot;<br/>   It is kind of like selling ice to eskimos...only the fact seems to be it&apos;s very hard to find people who actually compose micro-tonal music going beyond this list and the MMM list.  I&apos;d much rather &quot;sell ice in Jamaica&quot; (IE in a world in micro-tonal musicians also extending beyond the list)...the only problem is, as I&apos;ve learned by searching for micro-tonality outside these lists...seems no one lives in Jamaica.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Seriously Michael, you need to STOP complaining about what people on<br/>this list &quot;aren&apos;t doing&quot;, because I don&apos;t see you doing it, either.<br/>Lead by example, not by sitting in the back-seat and telling people<br/>they&apos;re driving in the wrong direction.&quot;<br/>   Who&apos;s ignorant here?   Maybe once every 4-5 months I work on a new scale system, with a new direction, compose a good few examples with it, carefully work out the advantages of each system, and try to help out with other systems (IE with John&apos;s system, for example).    True, I don&apos;t spend as much time dealing with, say, older systems like BP...but, to be honest, if I did so I realize I&apos;d be much so just duplicating the work of people far more expert at it.<br/>  Look, here are my areas of promotion/specialty<br/>A) New dead-easy-to-play scales...such as the &quot;Infinity&quot; scale system where there are very few possible sour chords.<br/>B) Older scales, like Ptolemic scales, with very similar properties to A<br/>C) Introduction of musicians very easy to listen on the first try, such as Neil Haverstick (&quot;African Stick&quot; in particular), Sevish, Carlo Serafani, and Marcus Satellite.  To be honest, while I admire people like Elaine Walker and Jacob Barton&apos;s efforts and technical knowledge, I&apos;ve had little luck marketing their music to musicians.<br/>D) Reviewing.  Yes, the criticism you keep complaining about.  I was the highest ranked reviews on Trax In Space for a very long time despite giving harsh yet constructive criticism much of the time...because musicians could make constructive sense out of my complaints.  Dare I admit, enough musicians have told me I have talent as a reviewer that I have come to believe it (so sue me).  To make it clear, when I criticize I don&apos;t do so to say &quot;your way is wrong, here&apos;s the right way&quot;, but rather to say &quot;here are several options you can use to fix this issue&quot; or &quot;here is one general pattern many options that can be used to fix this issue have&quot;.  When I appear to say people are heading in the wrong direction...it usually refers to their having their mind stuck in one direction when they should be open to many more.</p><p>   To make it even more obvious, the reason I focus on A-D is that appears very few people are focusing on those aspects of micro-tonal music and I don&apos;t want to be, say, the 100th person making JI guitars (and I can swear Kraig Grady preceded a whole bunch of people in that art, btw).<br/>  Far as D in particular, all too often all I hear is &quot;great music!&quot; from everyone on the list and rarely ever a solid critique...and I don&apos;t see how &quot;handing out medals to everyone&quot; is going to help people figure out how to improve their music and/or scales.  I&apos;d much rather be helpful on the scene than considered &quot;cool&quot; on it.</p></div><h3><a id=89594 href="#89594">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2010 3:18:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, this is the first I&apos;ve heard of you doing anything productive off this list, so forgive me for being ignorant of your &quot;outreach&quot; efforts.  You never talk about them, so I don&apos;t know how you expect me (or anyone) to know about it.  I retract some of my criticism; if you&apos;re actually out putting your money where your mouth is, then that&apos;s fantastic.  I&apos;d like to see more of what you&apos;ve done: where can I find the tracks you&apos;ve gotten played at clubs?  Can I see the article you had published anywhere?  Who&apos;s this professional guitarist you&apos;ve got &quot;on his way&quot;?  Do you have an actual microtonal album released somewhere?</p><p>That said, I don&apos;t publicize my own efforts much here, so I don&apos;t expect you to know about them.  But I am very actively engaged in trying to make the &quot;theory&quot; accessible to the average musician.  EDOs are my thing, so that&apos;s what I&apos;m focusing on, and if you are working on making other areas of theory accessible, that&apos;s great.  Jacob and Andrew particularly are working on things like visual diagrams, vocal exercises, stuff like that.  When I finish my alternative EDO primer, I think it will be the most accessible thing ever written on the subject, and I will definitely request your criticism of its accessibility.  I think making &quot;layman-level&quot; theory easily available is an important project in general, not necessarily to &quot;sell&quot; microtonality but at the very least to make it accessible to those who take an interest in it.  Once we have some finished resources available, we should all consolidate it.  The xenharmonic wiki has a long way to go in accessibility, since it&apos;s chaotic and full of really academic stuff, so maybe we should form another group to facilitate a sort of &quot;Web Microtonality 101&quot; site.</p><p>I&apos;m also paying out-of-pocket to have a set of instruments in 16-EDO made, so that I can start a band and also invite multiple people to get their hands on microtonal instruments and actually jam.  The Oakland indie/art/noise scene is quite vibrant and supportive, and I have lots of connections here...lots of people interested and just waiting for me to put instruments in their hands and show them the ropes.  I&apos;ve also got several friends in popular local bands who are willing to let me open for them whenever I have an act together.  Being in Acupuncture/Med School full-time, it&apos;s slow going for me...but I&apos;ve already played a solo microtonal acoustic set at a local art opening, so at least the ball is rolling.</p><p>I guess what I just don&apos;t get about you is why you don&apos;t see this List for what it is.  It&apos;s a place for research: would you write into a scientific journal like JAMA or Nature berating the scientists for making their research papers too difficult for the layman to read?  MOST people here aren&apos;t interested in reaching out to the layman, they&apos;re interested in pursuing their own particular research.  If people here were interested in writing for the &quot;layman&quot;, they&apos;d write for the layman.  I keep trying to tell you: you&apos;re in the wrong place for what you&apos;re trying to do.  This place is not layman-friendly.  Look at what happens any time you try to discuss ways to &quot;popularize&quot; microtonality--most people here just get upset.  Doesn&apos;t that tell you that you&apos;re in the wrong place??  You spend like 95% of your time here either clarifying yourself or defending yourself, trying to get something out of this list it just doesn&apos;t want to give.  It&apos;s just wasting everyone&apos;s time--especially YOURS!</p><p>Most of the music that gets posted is not &quot;serious&quot; composition deserving of critique; it&apos;s exploratory doodling, little sketches of ideas meant to inspire further exploration, not to stand on its own as &quot;great&quot; music.  This is why your criticism of it seems so misguided to me: to me it&apos;s obvious that most of the work posted here is not considered &quot;serious&quot; by its composers, and thus not worth critiquing.  If I thought it WAS serious, I&apos;d be critiquing it too, because yes: very little produced here has aesthetic value beyond the curiousity of its tuning.  Certainly nothing I&apos;VE produced microtonally is nearly on par with my 12-tET music, aesthetically-speaking.  Not even remotely.  So criticism of my microtonal work I tend to disregard--I already know what it&apos;s lacking, and I don&apos;t need to hear it from other people.  Not everything produced has to be amazing; the way to learn microtonality is to work with it as much as possible, and to produce a LOT of rubbish along the way.  Eventually it all starts to make sense and people can start producing GOOD stuff, or at least SERIOUS stuff which is worth critiquing.</p><p>But c&apos;mon, Chris posts a sloppy little guitar improv and asks &quot;hey guys, does this sound xenharmonic to you?&quot; and then you go off on a tangent about how the chords are no good and its not gonna sell microtonality to anyone, and then you go even further off on a tangent about how most microtonal scales either sound too much like 12-tET or too &quot;unresolved&quot; or &quot;unconfident&quot;, all in response to one little &quot;doodle&quot; he farted out, and you think THAT&apos;S a valid criticism that&apos;s useful to the community?</p><p>Look, man, I want to tear down the barriers keeping microtonality hidden just as much as you do.  I&apos;m not as optimistic as you regarding how much interest I think we can generate in microtonality, but I agree it could be a good bit more than there currently is.  But this isn&apos;t the place for that mission--it&apos;s the exact OPPOSITE, in fact.  This list is WHERE all the arcane theory that MAKES microtonality inaccessible was INVENTED IN THE FIRST PLACE, and newer (and more arcane) theories are being developed here every day.  This place has a strong tendency toward informational entropy, and if we want to combat that, we have to go elsewhere.  Where?  I don&apos;t know.  The Ning was a good start, but it&apos;s &quot;going out of business&quot; in July when it stops being free and there&apos;s no alternative yet in place.  Rather than trying to corral a bunch of curmudgeonly academic-types who are unsympathetic to your/our goal, you should be building and deepening your relationships with the precious few who ARE sympathetic.  And most of those people AREN&apos;T HERE.</p></div><h3><a id=89595 href="#89595">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2010 4:46:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Well, this is the first I&apos;ve heard of you doing anything productive off<br/>this list, so forgive me for being ignorant of your &quot;outreach&quot; efforts.<br/>You never talk about them, so I don&apos;t know how you expect me (or<br/>anyone) to know about it.&quot;<br/>   I usually am not a big believer in bragging about things unless I think I have something rather unique and at least somewhat useful...that is, unless someone forces me into a corner and blindly accuses me.

But you are right, that place is not as active as it could/should be, possibly because all the actually active people are too BUSY for internet discussions most of the time.  But if you actually PM them or send them e-mails, most of them are very responsive, and very knowledgeable.  Not all of them know the deep esoteric theory that people like Gene, Graham, and Carl possess here, but (no offense, guys), that theory is largely unnecessary for the actual making of microtonal music.  The nuts and bolts that the neophyte needs to get his/her feet wet is actually pretty simple, and just about any of us could probably explain it pretty straightforwardly.</p><p>&gt;   Alright so...where on earth are they?

The reason I stick with stating the scales under the popularizing micro-tonality &quot;framework&quot; is that I assume in any type of research the final goal is its use on a more abstract scope and basis.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Well, the &quot;mission statement&quot; is a bit more idealistic than what<br/>actually takes place here.  That&apos;s why there have been so many<br/>off-shoots (like MMM): because this List just has a tendency to devolve<br/>into esotericism, which may contradict its mission statement, but what<br/>can you do about it?&quot;<br/>  You&apos;re right, absolutely nothing.  My hope is that those (few?) of us not into that can at least do our own thing in peace on this list and not be shouted at for our &quot;lack of academic credibility&quot;...and maybe even occasionally find people willing to work with us toward our goals.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Well, there is no &quot;list&quot; where these people have gathered, but most of<br/>them are on the Ning.  They&apos;re not terribly active there because few<br/>people seem to be trying to involve them in dialogs.  Just about<br/>everyone I listed in that list of &quot;people who are out there selling<br/>microtonality&quot; is NOT here, but IS at the Ning--Jacob Barton, Andrew<br/>Heathwaite, Elaine Walker, Ron Sword, Paul Rubenstein, XJ Scott, etc.<br/>etc.  &quot;<br/>   Heh, don&apos;t know what to say about &quot;ning&quot;...used to be discussions got a lot of feedback...now very few people seem to be actively posting or replying.  I wrote to Paul about 3 weeks ago...and still no response.  It&apos;s a good idea and it really does seem to have the right people for that sort of thing...but discussions seem tricky to get a response from over there.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Actually, Chris posted asking if he DID manage to make it sound<br/>xenharmonic, because it DIDN&apos;T sound xenharmonic to him&quot;</p><p>His message said<br/>&gt;&quot;does this sound xenharmonic?<br/><a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/MOTU/zurna/motu-try4-zurna.mp3">http://micro.soonlabel.com/MOTU/zurna/motu-try4-zurna.mp3</a><br/>When you have listened please check out the MOTU tuning compared to 12<br/>et via scala.&quot;<br/>  He did NOT anywhere specify if he wanted it to sound Xenharmonic or not...although he did say it didn&apos;t sound Xenharmonic to him.  One could easily have taken it either way IE either &quot;he wants it to sound Xenharmonic&quot; or &quot;he wants it to trick people into thinking it sounds like 12TET&quot;.  I leaned toward the latter as he mentioned comparing it to 12TET...and in the past I&apos;ve notice when most people compare a scale to 12TET like that, they are going for a 12TET-like (or better) level of consonance.<br/>   Perhaps he DID mean &quot;I want to see how UNLIKE 12TET this scale can be&quot;...in which case IMVHO he did a very ambiguous job of explaining what he wanted as a response.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Only because you are so critical of others.  If all I see is you telling others to do better/work harder, and I don&apos;t see any work that you are<br/>doing, I&apos;ll assume you&apos;re a hypocrite&quot;<br/>   That&apos;s much your own ignorance then if you still hold that opinion...especially considering how much I post that directly reflects many projects I&apos;ve worked on specifically for that goal.  Again (easy example) my scales and detailed analysis of them sure as anything don&apos;t write themselves....and just because I post a lot doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t also do a whole ton of work off-list.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I<br/>call it like I see it, though I don&apos;t always see it &quot;right&quot;...and if I<br/>see it wrong, I&apos;m always willing to stand corrected and retract any<br/>mistaken statements I have made.&quot;<br/>  Understood, but please double-check with me and look at all the work I have posted here very closely and think &quot;is it possible he did spend a whole lot of time off-list working this research through?&quot; before you not only &quot;tell&quot; me what I&apos;ve done, but do it in a very dramatic fashion as if I&apos;ve &quot;repeatedly earned your disrespect&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Like I said: they&apos;re on Ning, or in their private worlds.  XJ Scott is<br/>probably the most knowledgeable and most friendly AND most likely to<br/>want to help make microtonality as accessible as possible, and his site <a href="http://www.nonoctave.com">www.nonoctave.com</a> is occasionally a good place to discuss things.&quot;<br/>  Sounds like a plan...I&apos;ve conversed with him a few times and, as with Sevish, highly recommend him as a contact for anyone who, like myself, is interested in &quot;popularizing&quot; micro-tonal music and/or working on new scales or scale theories that may go with it.</p></div><h3><a id=89604 href="#89604">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2010 9:08:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You did not go back and read the complete message, obviously.</p><p>On Fri, May 28, 2010 at 11:48 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Actually, Chris posted asking if he DID manage to make it sound xenharmonic, because it DIDN&apos;T sound xenharmonic to him&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; His message said<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;does this sound xenharmonic?<br/>&gt; <a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/MOTU/zurna/motu-try4-zurna.mp3">http://micro.soonlabel.com/MOTU/zurna/motu-try4-zurna.mp3</a><br/>&gt; When you have listened please check out the MOTU tuning compared to 12 et via scala.&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; He did NOT anywhere specify if he wanted it to sound Xenharmonic or not...although he did say it didn&apos;t sound Xenharmonic to him.&nbsp; One could easily have taken it either way IE either &quot;he wants it to sound Xenharmonic&quot; or &quot;he wants it to trick people into thinking it sounds like 12TET&quot;.&nbsp; I leaned toward the latter as he mentioned comparing it to 12TET...and in the past I&apos;ve notice when most people compare a scale to 12TET like that, they are going for a 12TET-like (or better) level of consonance.<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps he DID mean &quot;I want to see how UNLIKE 12TET this scale can be&quot;...in which case IMVHO he did a very ambiguous job of explaining what he wanted as a response.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=89609 href="#89609">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2010 11:55:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 29 May 2010 06:29, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, the &quot;mission statement&quot; is a bit more idealistic than what<br/>&gt; actually takes place here. &nbsp;That&apos;s why there have been so many<br/>&gt; off-shoots (like MMM): because this List just has a tendency to<br/>&gt; devolve into esotericism, which may contradict its mission<br/>&gt; statement, but what can you do about it? &nbsp;This list is a product of<br/>&gt; the people who frequent it, and it just so happens that the majority<br/>&gt; of people who frequent it are interested in &quot;advanced microtonal<br/>&gt; academic work&quot;.</p><p>So here you are, having this big old ding-dong, and thinking that &quot;the<br/>List&quot; has some emergent consciousness that you&apos;re not part of.

This is how science works: the real educated scientists write papers that turn up in academic journals, and the half-educated (or sometimes fully-educated) scientists turn around and distill those writings into a form that can be digested by the layman.

The three top complaints I&apos;ve heard from<br/>&gt; actual professional musicicians about micro-tonality are 1) It sounds<br/>&gt; a-tonal and just way too disonant and/or &quot;wait, what&apos;s the<br/>&gt; difference?&quot;. 2) 12TET theory is hard enough. 3) Where on earth can I<br/>&gt; buy instruments to play it with and/or also instruments so my other<br/>&gt; band members can play with me in the same tuning?  And/or is that<br/>&gt; going to be ridiculously expensive to do?</p><p>Well, to an extent they&apos;re right. 1) Microtonality is great for atonal music, and it opens up a whole new level of dissonance beyond the relatively mild 12-ET. But what&apos;s wrong with that? (It also extends the boundaries of tonal music and allows for better consonance.) 2) Yeah, the theory is harder. 12-ET has the benefit of a long tradition (basically meantone with some extra bonuses tacked on), so you can more easily learn by example without needing the theory. But with effort, the only theory you really need is &quot;trust your ears&quot;. Theory can save a load of trial and error, but you still need your ears and your musical intuition to make good music with what you get from it. 3) Fretless instruments, trombones, voice, even theremin if you&apos;re good at it. It would be nice if retunable keyboards were more common (I learned quite a bit playing around with my DX7II), but these days we&apos;ve got MIDI software to help with that.</p><p>But none of what I&apos;ve said here is anything new. Would it be great if more musicians were paying more attention to tuning? Of course it would, but the important thing is to use whatever resources you have to make the kind of music you&apos;re inspired to write. Tuning is just one of the resources that happens to interest me the most.</p><p>&gt; And most people I&apos;ve seen randomly give up on micro-tonal music EVEN<br/>&gt; after hearing great things about it online are the same people who<br/>&gt; say #1...most often those who experience their first micro-tonal<br/>&gt; listening experience as something dissonant or sounding almost<br/>&gt; indistinguishable from 12TET. So IMVHO we can say all we want about<br/>&gt; how great micro-tonal music is...but as long as we don&apos;t have those<br/>&gt; top 3 covered we end up getting someone interested enough to &quot;try the<br/>&gt; product&quot; and then have them feel &quot;cheated by the false<br/>&gt; advertising&quot;...putting us right back at square one or worse.</p><p>The thing is, there isn&apos;t a single unified idea of &quot;microtonal music&quot; that you can generalize about from one or two examples. I mean, it can be anything from Harry Partch&apos;s 43-tone chromelodeons and diamond marimbas to traditional Scandinavian music with overtone flutes. Often microtonal music can be strange in other ways beyond just the tuning. And tunings that sound indistinguishable from 12-ET to a casual listener may have more subtle influences on the mood or style of music.</p><p>&gt; Far as a good group to actually work on discussion (and not just<br/>&gt; general info about) promoting the popularity of micro-tonal music<br/>&gt; (particularly among non-academics)...I have yet to find a good site.<br/>&gt; We seem to have a TON of options for academic micro-tonallity but<br/>&gt; very few for &quot;casual micro-tonality&quot;.

There&apos;s certainly a need for more accessible and clear introductions to tuning topics in many areas. Promoting the popularity would be a nice bonus, if it gets more people writing the kind of music we like to hear, but I think it&apos;s safe to say that&apos;s not why most of us are here.</p></div><h3><a id=89709 href="#89709">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2010 6:45:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>genewardsmith wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is this an idea for dummies:<br/>&gt; &gt; (1) Take a 5-limit scale<br/>&gt; &gt; (2) Temper it in 240 et<br/>&gt; &gt; (3) Make music with it<br/>&gt; &gt; If not, what needs to be added?</p><p>Most probably won&apos;t see the point of using 240-ET (assuming that you&apos;ve made it clear what a 5-limit scale is and why tempering can be beneficial).

But the only difference, is I&apos;m focusing on what I believe is the first step toward popularizing micro-tonality...I don&apos;t disagree with Igs&apos;s idea, I just think of mine as a bit of a necessary introduction that likely needs to become before it.</p><p>  I consider that step as getting people interested in a scale that sounds all four of as consonant as 12TET, easily recognizable as different than 12TET, as flexible as 12TET, and dead easy to play on the first try IE with virtually no learning curve (bringing the focus almost purely on musical emotion and not on theory).  It would be like introducing a young child to music by giving him/her a pentatonic scale instead of a diatonic one to give a sense of &quot;instant accomplishment&quot;.</p><p>  The next step I believe, is an &quot;intermediate choice in tuning&quot; approach (kind of like giving the now practiced child a diatonic scale to use) where the audience is already opened up to the idea from step one and has more patience.  Such a step would involve many not-too-hard-to-learn different theories and scales, such as those Igliashon is planning to write tutorials on.</p><p>  The third and final step IMVHO, would be an &quot;absolute choice in tuning&quot; learning process which would involve advanced tunings including some of the huge ones posted here that take a lot of theory (or a great ear) to really play well.  That would be like asking the child-turned-trained-young-adult to start modulating in 12TET like a jazz musician...obviously much much harder than playing well-balanced consonance/dissonance in a pentatonic scale.<br/>   These tunings would be tricky to play in well enough to sound like more than just a musician who hasn&apos;t quite learned to balance stably between consonance and dissonance and/or play good chords yet.  That&apos;s where the &quot;laymen&quot; will eventually meet the true academics here, IMVHO...when they get to the point they can quickly learn to separate &quot;the wheat from the chaff&quot; in even the most difficult scales.</p></div><h3><a id=89765 href="#89765">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2010 10:48:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;    A side question becomes what under JI counts as good and how far away error-wise from JI ratios comes across as decent?

To me there is a huge difference in my mind simply between scale that qualify as microtonal and microtonal scales that actually meet unique goals...and naturally different musicians will want to meet different goals and thus gravitate toward scales that meet such goals.</p></div><h3><a id=89788 href="#89788">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2010 7:58:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;The main argument that the &quot;I hate theory&quot; folks usually had was that the theory being taught was often irrelevant and based in somewhat arbitrary musical &quot;rules&quot; that limited expression rather than pointing at the moon; they were proscriptive rather than descriptive.&quot;</p><p>   Agreed...I&apos;d never go that far or say anything that anti-theory with a straight face (or recommend anyone else do so).</p><p>  I actually agree with both sides...there are many rules in music that do seem quite &quot;proscriptive rather than descriptive&quot; or based more on opinion or staying true to an old theory than actually being pleasing to the human ear/mind.

The &quot;sales pitch&quot; for 31 was very convincing, but I was disappointed with it.  For starters, there are few &quot;simple&quot; (10 notes or fewer) MOS scales that yield more than a couple of otonal 7-limit tetrads.  Bringing the flavor of 7-limit harmony into a diatonic structure requires chromaticism, which is confusing (on a guitar).  The fifths were definitely NOT a significant problem, on an electric guitar being used to play metal...though tuning using harmonics became impossible.</p><p>What I wanted from 31 I just didn&apos;t get: an alternative tonal structure nearly as simple as the diatonic scale which supplies similarly-resolved but significantly-different harmonies, with a ratio of &quot;consonant triads to notes in the scale&quot; comparable to the diatonic scale.  Of course, I was focused on 7-limit harmonies at the time and didn&apos;t discover the Mohajira-ish scale until I had abandoned 31...I might have gotten more mileage out of it if I had...but even Mohajira only gives 5 consonant triads out of 7 notes in the scale.  If you don&apos;t mind using more than 10 notes in a scale, 31&apos;s great; you can use it for all those temperaments that Gene listed, giving it a lot of &quot;bang&quot; for the buck.  But from a marketing standpoint, this might be overwhelming for a new-comer.  I was certainly overwhelmed.</p><p>The web resources on 31-tET cover precious little of the non-diatonic possibilities of 31-tET.  However, Ron Sword has written an exhaustive &quot;Tricesimoprimal Scales for Guitar&quot; book that I would have KILLED FOR when I was starting out.</p><p>Oddly, chords weren&apos;t a problem on the 31-tone guitar.  Even some barre chords were do-able.  The biggest challenge was just keeping track of which fret I was supposed to be on when playing a non-diatonic scale (the diatonic scale itself was a total breeze).</p><p>Bottom line: I see 31-tET as definitely &quot;marketable&quot;, but not a &quot;do-it-all&quot; tuning.

If Radiohead were to make an album of 31-tet<br/>&gt; music, people would be jumping on that too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But yes, it serves as an excellent 7-limit extension of meantone. To a<br/>&gt; lesser extent, it has decent approximations of 11-limit harmony as<br/>&gt; well, although the flat 11/8 drives me nuts most of the time, and it<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t distinguish between 9/7 and 14/11 (and consequently its 9/7 is<br/>&gt; pretty sharp). If you&apos;re really adventurous you can hit some sketches<br/>&gt; of 13-limit intervals as well. Furthermore, despite its having 31<br/>&gt; notes, every note has a clear 11-limit purpose (or a few purposes),<br/>&gt; except for the 12 step interval (and its reciprocal) which is best<br/>&gt; thought of as 13/10 and 20/13.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So for what it&apos;s worth, that means it&apos;s alright with me. Although I<br/>&gt; think the popularity of many of these tunings will depend on the<br/>&gt; instrument they&apos;re going to be used on.

Unless that is...you assume the only way to have a consonant triad is to use a virtually perfect 5th.  The 22/15-ish &quot;alternative 5th&quot; that appears twice in the scale sounds fine to me.</p><p>&gt;&quot;But from a marketing standpoint, this might be overwhelming for a<br/>new-comer.  I was certainly overwhelmed.&quot;</p><p>  (Assuming use of Mohajira)...were you mostly intimidated just by the triads or other things as well?<br/>  Personally I think the goal of virtually-perfect-fifth triads most often leads you either straight on the path to rather intimidatingly large (for most people) scales or variants on mean-tone which don&apos;t meet the &quot;similarly-resolved but significantly-different harmonies&quot; qualification that you brought up.  I figure Pythagorus (or at least the Pythagoreans) may well be laughing in his/their grave...about just how many people still think the 5th is the &quot;sole divine ratio&quot; and so rarely dare to &quot;disobey it&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;For starters, there are few &quot;simple&quot; (10 notes or fewer) MOS scales that yield more than a couple of o-tonal 7-limit tetrads.&quot;<br/>  Agreed...the flip side is what&apos;s so evil about 11-limit (assuming, for example, some of the dyads that form the 11-limit chord are lower than 11-limit)?</p><p>&gt;&quot;The biggest challenge was just keeping track of which fret I was<br/>supposed to be on when playing a non-diatonic scale (the diatonic scale<br/>itself was a total breeze).&quot;<br/>  I could definitely see that on a guitar.  I keep picturing in my head a guitar with frets that slide along the strings (rather than but glued to the neck) and could lock in different positions.   This way you could, say, adjust the fret positions the only use subsets of 31TET at once.  Thus you could, say, adjust the frets for 7-tone Mohajira and only have 7 frets per octave.  Or buy more fret &quot;beads&quot; to slide onto the string and make, say, 10-tone per octave scales.<br/>  Any reason why that sort of thing couldn&apos;t be done?</p><p>   I guess you could say I see maybe 4 or so really good beginner scales in 31TET that have a bit of everything though (and I&apos;d argue almost any TET has this problem) to meet virtually every need of every artist, you need several different tunings available.  Thus I really think there&apos;s a huge need for a guitar with slide-able frets...and ones you can alter without visiting, say, a carpenter or a welder.</p></div><h3><a id=89858 href="#89858">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2010 2:32:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Jun 2, 2010 at 2:08 PM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some people like the fifth, finding it mellow.

The &quot;sales pitch&quot;<br/>&gt; for 31 was very convincing, but I was disappointed with it.  For<br/>&gt; starters, there are few &quot;simple&quot; (10 notes or fewer) MOS scales that<br/>&gt; yield more than a couple of otonal 7-limit tetrads.  Bringing the<br/>&gt; flavor of 7-limit harmony into a diatonic structure requires<br/>&gt; chromaticism, which is confusing (on a guitar).  The fifths were<br/>&gt; definitely NOT a significant problem, on an electric guitar being<br/>&gt; used to play metal...though tuning using harmonics became impossible.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What I wanted from 31 I just didn&apos;t get: an alternative tonal<br/>&gt; structure nearly as simple as the diatonic scale which supplies<br/>&gt; similarly-resolved but significantly-different harmonies, with a<br/>&gt; ratio of &quot;consonant triads to notes in the scale&quot; comparable to the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale.  Of course, I was focused on 7-limit harmonies at the<br/>&gt; time and didn&apos;t discover the Mohajira-ish scale until I had abandoned<br/>&gt; 31...I might have gotten more mileage out of it if I had...but even<br/>&gt; Mohajira only gives 5 consonant triads out of 7 notes in the scale.<br/>&gt; If you don&apos;t mind using more than 10 notes in a scale, 31&apos;s great;<br/>&gt; you can use it for all those temperaments that Gene listed, giving it<br/>&gt; a lot of &quot;bang&quot; for the buck.  But from a marketing standpoint, this<br/>&gt; might be overwhelming for a new-comer.  I was certainly overwhelmed.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in 7-limit harmonies, you&apos;re pretty much stuck with scales having at least 10 notes (it seems that quite a few of the good 7-limit temperaments have a decatonic in them somewhere), but there&apos;s a handful of other options. You could get by with diminished[8] but you can do that in 12-ET. Semaphore has a 9-note MOS with a single 4:5:6:7 tetrad, which is a little better than meantone, and the 9-note MOS of negri has two of them.</p><p>Keemun is probably one of the best options as far as a temperament having relatively good accuracy while not requiring many notes in a chain for 7-limit tetrads (only 7!) Dave Keenan has a page about the 11-note chain of minor-thirds scale of this temperament (as described on <a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/ChainOfMinor3rds.htm">http://dkeenan.com/Music/ChainOfMinor3rds.htm</a>), and it works with Larry Hanson&apos;s keyboard (<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/hanson.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/hanson.PDF</a>). Maybe it&apos;s not your cup of tea, but it&apos;s at least worth a try.</p><p>One nice thing about regular temperament mappings is that you can easily tell how many notes in a chain you&apos;ll need if you want 7-limit tetrads (with simple arithmetic). Take negri as an example, with a generator mapping of &lt;0, -4, 3, -2]. The most negative number in the mapping is -4 and the most positive number is 3; so you&apos;ll need 4 + 1 + 3 = 8 notes in a chain for a single 4:5:6:7 or 1/4:5:6:7 chord (-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3). Every additional note in the chain gives you another pair of tetrads, so the 10-note MOS has 3 of each (otonal and utonal). With scales that repeat at a fraction of an octave, this gives you the number of notes in a period, so you&apos;ll have to multiply by the number of periods in an octave.</p></div><h3><a id=89879 href="#89879">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2010 9:20:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;I can&apos;t imagine trying to talk my younger self into starting with 16 or<br/>18-EDO instead of 31.

Good for those who need an instrument to easily play 12TET-style songs along with more exotic scale based ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; B) Gives a &quot;Mohajira MOS&quot; scale using x = -3 to 3 and 11/9 as the generator to create (11/9)^x / 2^y.

One thing that&apos;s odd about microtonality is it has many strong theories...many of which contradict each other.  And even weirder thing is that many strong new theories can come about from going against ones of the past.</p><p>   To me there&apos;s nothing wrong with &quot;institutionalized theory&quot;...minus any sort of a assumption that a musician and/or theorist can&apos;t possibly do great things without it.  &quot;Igs&quot;, your quote of (paraphrased) &quot;I figure things out by ear...and try to match them to theory after the fact&quot; is a great example of that.<br/>  The things that make theory (be it institutionalized or self-taught) work to me are how it works for my ears, how consistent it is (IE that it doesn&apos;t contradict itself or basic psychoacoustics), and (perhaps as a bonus) what % of people who have actually heard the theory believe it.</p><p>  I just made a dance song in 100% 12TET and then &quot;randomly&quot; swapped it to a slightly modified Ptolemic tuning (re-tuned to my liking via nothing but my own ears to fit the mood of the song).  And note the Pythagorean-based tunings (mean-tone, 12TET, etc.) have always had somewhat of a monopoly of Ptolemy&apos;s tunings.<br/>  Yet when I showed it to the same DJ who approved the 12TET version actually claimed it sounded BETTER with the re-tuning.  And this isn&apos;t a friend-to-friend sort of approval, he&apos;s going to play the thing live.  And...note my &quot;institutional copying&quot; was limited to starting with Ptolemy&apos;s scale as the basis...the rest was raw tweaking to fit the emotion of the song.</p></div>
