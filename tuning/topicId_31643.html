At least within the framework of tonal music, the affinity of tones being<br/>in anoctave interval is so pronounced that this relationship is termedoctave<br/>equivalence. For successive tones, affinity becomes apparent in the fact that<br/>repetition of a musical phrase in a &quot;transposition&quot; by an octave, or, to a<br/>lesser extent, by a fifth, is hardly perceived as a transposition at all - the<br/>transposition is often hardly noticed.

Affinity means that tones may be perceived as similar in<br/>&gt;certain aspects; that in some respect a tone may be replaced by<br/>&gt;another one; and that one tone may even be confused with another<br/>&gt;one.

Would you add other<br/>&gt;pairs of pitch intervals to (your) list?</p><p>Well, I&apos;d add the fourth, but probably Terhardt already had this<br/>included, since it&apos;s merely an octave-affinity combined with a fifth-<br/>affinity.</p><p>This rings VERY TRUE to me. Note that Terhardt is talking about<br/>_successive tones_ -- not _simultaneous tones_. In a statistical<br/>sampling of musical scales in cultures where simultaneous harmony is<br/>not used, one sees only very few intervals show up with more<br/>frequency than one could attribute to chance. These intervals are the<br/>octave, fifth, and fourth.</p><p>&gt;What about people like Mozart?

Are<br/>&gt;they more likely to explore the tonal &quot;possibilities&quot; at a higher<br/>&gt;rate, thus &quot;learning&quot; faster?</p><p>Sounds reasonable -- but note that Terhardt does not take such a<br/>strong &quot;nurture over nature&quot; view when it comes to _simultaneous<br/>harmony_.</p><p>&gt;Would you agree that it is true that &quot;musical abilities&quot; (in<br/>&gt;general) are not (at all) related to &quot;nature&quot; (&quot;in-born&quot;)?</p><p>Not at all, and that&apos;s not at all what Terhardt is arguing here or in<br/>most of the other webpages on his site.</p><p>&gt;How does this explain the (often heard) sentiments of musicians<br/>&gt;relating to the musical &quot;improvisation&quot; of musicians, to the effect<br/>&gt;that - rather than their concious minds speaking *through the<br/>&gt;music*, the &quot;music&quot; seems, instead to &quot;speak&quot; *through the musician*<br/>&gt;(without a focal concious awareness at play on the part of the<br/>&gt;practicing/performing musician during the process of the action of<br/>&gt;creating sounds).</p><p>I don&apos;t think that those who feel this way (myself included) would<br/>tend to or feel logically compelled to fall into either the &quot;nature&quot;<br/>or &quot;nurture&quot; camps when it comes to the origin of musical tone-<br/>systems. On second thought, it seems quite evident to me that even<br/>the deepest and most profound improvisational expressions of the<br/>musicians of a given culture are close to _totally unintelligible_ to<br/>listeners from a greatly removed culture, almost as profoundly as a<br/>great work of literature in the Anaphorian language (my apologies,<br/>Kraig) would be totally unintelligible to you, an English speaker.</p><p>&gt;Note that Terhardt (in the full text of his webpage) refers to his<br/>&gt;concepts of &quot;affinity of tones&quot; as relating to succesive tones &gt;<br/>(&quot;melody&quot;) as well as simultaneous tones (&quot;harmony&quot;).</p><p>True, but he is not nearly as restrictive when it comes to the set of<br/>intervals that have &quot;special characteristics&quot; such as &quot;consonance&quot; in<br/>the use of simultaneous tones. &quot;Affinity&quot; is only one possible<br/>characteristic that a pair of tones may have, but its the only one<br/>that seems to occur &quot;in nature&quot; for _successive tones_. Other &quot;non-<br/>affine&quot; pairs of tones may nevertheless possess a _special<br/>relationship_, independent of _nurture_, when it comes to<br/>_simultaneous tones_. (Note that when I say &quot;in nature&quot;, I&apos;m<br/>considering intimate, unconscious familiarity with the spectrum of<br/>the human voice &quot;natural&quot;, since hardly any musician in the world can<br/>be said to operate without such familiarity, whether it&apos;s inborn or<br/>not.)</p></div><h3><a id=31668 href="#31668">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/18/2001 1:58:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; With all due respect to dear Mr. Terhardt, I would have to say that<br/>&gt; even though he does not seem to mention timbre here *at all*, he<br/>must<br/>&gt; have some special timbres in mind.</p><p>Actually, he states that the effect hold good even with sine waves.</p><p>&gt; To speak about this kind of thing<br/>&gt; outside of a musical context, where timbre, rhythm, and spacial<br/>&gt; considerations are removed, is only looking at the *surface* of<br/>&gt; things.

I tend to include it, but only because I tend to assume<br/>octave-equivalence, and in an octave-equivalent view of a musical<br/>system, an affinity at a fifth translates into an affinity at a<br/>fourth. Even if one does not explicitly assume octave-equivalence,<br/>one can argue that, since virtually all cultures have experimented<br/>with building both an octave and a fifth in the same direction from a<br/>given starting pitch, the vast majority of those would have stumbled<br/>upon the fourth early and often in their constructions, and hence it<br/>would acheive a measure of ubiquity.</p><p>Similarly, a view which is focused on odd limit rather than prime<br/>limit would address your objection very well, since an odd limit of 3<br/>would include only the &quot;affine&quot; intervals, while a prime limit of 3<br/>would also include intervals such as 9:8, 16:9, 27:16, 32:27, 81:64,<br/>etc.</p><p>I guess these arguments are not as convincing as the simple statement<br/>that while primeness is an important property of _pitch systems_, it<br/>has absolutely nothing to say about the innate, non-cultural, sensual<br/>quality of an interval, when generalized away from any musical<br/>context. This may seem overly abstract to you, but it seems essential<br/>to me that one eliminates unnecessary hypotheses from a theory, and<br/>ascribing importance to &quot;primeness&quot; in isolated intervals seems just<br/>such a hypothesis, especially if you&apos;re going to build up from those<br/>isolated intervals and continue to have a clear picture of what&apos;s<br/>going on. Primeness comes into the picture when you look at JI tuning<br/>systems precisely inasmuch as the mathematics of primes (I&apos;m thinking<br/>the prime factorization theorem) forces it to do so, and no more and<br/>no less, I would argue. I see no evidence to the contrary, and<br/>ascribing a &quot;prime sense&quot; to our ears seems like a clear violation of<br/>Occam&apos;s razor to me.</p></div><h3><a id=31733 href="#31733">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2001 12:40:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Terhardt did _not_ include the fourth in his list of &quot;affine&quot;<br/>&gt; intervals.</p><p>Affine?
