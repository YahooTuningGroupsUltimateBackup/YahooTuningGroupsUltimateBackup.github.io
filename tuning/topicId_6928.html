S. B. Woolhouse, who wrote in the 19th century: &quot;It is very<br/>misleading to suppose that the necessity of temperament applies<br/>only to instruments which have fixed tones.  Singers and performers<br/>on perfect instruments must all temper their intervals, or they<br/>could not keep in tune with each other, or even with themselves;<br/>an on arriving at the same notes by different routes, would be<br/>continually finding a want of agreement. [. . .]&quot;</p><p>&gt;I believe that Mr. Woolhouse, in stating that equal temperament<br/>&gt;is rightly the long established basis of tuning, really went too far<br/>&gt;and overlooked the fact of experience that the deviations of equal<br/>&gt;temperament from the just ratios are so large that they really<br/>&gt;do have an appreciable effect on the sound of music performed in<br/>&gt;equal temperament.</p><p>First of all, my knowledge of Woolhouse&apos;s theories suggests that he viewed<br/>some form of meantone temperament to be ideal. According to Mandelbaum,<br/>Woolhouse derived an optimal meantone tuning (I believe it was the<br/>squared-error optimal tuning for the three 5-limit consonances, namely<br/>7/26-comma meantone), and decided that 19-tone equal tempermant was a close<br/>enough approximation, and one which gave to the musician the desirable<br/>properties of a closed system which were giving 12-equal its rise to<br/>prominence at the time. In fact, 31- or 50-tone equal temperaments would be<br/>better approximations (though not as convenient from a practical point of<br/>view), and neither of those tunings commits any errors larger than 6 cents<br/>in any of the classic (5-limit) consonant intervals. 19-equal has major<br/>thirds and perfect fifths that are over 7 cents off. 12-equal, of course,<br/>has major thirds 14 cents off and minor thirds 16 cents off.</p><p>Second and more importantly, I think Dave Hill has missed the importance of<br/>the last quoted statement (from Woolhouse) above. Many if not most<br/>common-practice musical passages performed in just intonation would result<br/>in contradictory tunings for the same written pitch. Whether or not Mr.<br/>Woolhouse went &quot;too far&quot;, Mr. Hill has failed to address Woolhouse&apos;s point<br/>here. Furthermore, far from overlooking the errors from just intonation,<br/>Woolhouse sought the best way to reduce them while preserving the musical<br/>meaning of the notes in the Western tradition.</p></div><h3><a id=6955 href="#6955">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Stockhausen though only instrumental use of<br/>microtones I know of is sirius. his ripoff of the partch diamond minus the 11<br/>used in the most uninventive way possible. O I forgot his other rip-off<br/>Stimmumg which he wrote after a Lamonte young performance. Badings when I met<br/>him expressed that his 31 tone works were for him a 31 tone notation for JI.<br/>He played me extensive JI pieces for two violins in the range of harmonics<br/>above 20 for those who dismiss such things.

None of his microtonal works are<br/>available as far as i know. I would love to get them. especially the violin<br/>music i heard!<br/>Joel Mandlebaum work is also a shame should be available as the little i heard<br/>was of worth! His book remains one of the best!<br/>Hank Badings had the best ear of any composer I have ever met. He was also one<br/>of the few people who understood  what i was doing, how and why i was<br/>manipulating my material the way I do.  He was probably more supportive of my<br/>doings than any one I can think of. Economics forced me to leave sooner than i<br/>would have liked. At that time recordings of his work consisted of one<br/>electronic piece.<br/>I don&apos;t know of any composers here who know who he is . These last two even<br/>more so. This is not my doing for God&apos;s Sake</p><p>&gt; Blackwood and Maneri are there.</p><p>&gt; Really?, i never noticed!</p><p>&gt; Young is<br/>&gt; not,</p><p>This is more I believe a matter of choice with the latter. Notice how<br/>Stockhausen has once again imitated Young in handling his own stuff.<br/>Stockhausen Studie I used a set intonation system is the only one i am aware<br/>of. Yes, the Russian National Anthem in Hymnen uses microtonal inflections.</p><p>&gt; and much Riley and Harrison are 12-equal. Less so than Ives, Stockhausen,<br/>&gt; Xenakis.</p><p>I&apos;ve always thought that Xenakis Pleides is an imitation of Harrison but turned<br/>up. Anyway the Pitch of these square plates seems to be more color-oriented<br/>than anything! You forgot Ligeti who has used different Temperaments. I heard<br/>one piece here where he threw in some ocarinas as his tribute to Partch. Gee,<br/>thanks!</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
