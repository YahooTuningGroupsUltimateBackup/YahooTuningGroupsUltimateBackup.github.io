This is<br/>&gt; much better than any ET with lass than 118 notes.</p><p>Another reason why I like the 72-ET notation so much.</p><p>&gt; 144-tET cannot improve upon any of 72-tET&apos;s approximations.</p><p>Well, as I said, I&apos;m still not convinced of 144&apos;s usefulness,<br/>but I got interested in it, and thought it worth exploring.</p><p>&gt; Partch obtained his full 43-tone system by transposing parts<br/>&gt; of the tonality diamond to centers other than 1/1.<br/>&gt; What is important in these transpositions is that the harmonic<br/>&gt; integrity of the each of the diamonds be preserved, not<br/>&gt; that the complex, secondary ratios be represented well with<br/>&gt; respect to the 1/1 of the overall system (G).</p><p>You are absolutely correct.<br/>(Do you *never* tire of me telling you that?)</p><p>I have to agree, because of your eloquent argument,<br/>that Dan Stearns was right and I should have just left<br/>Partch alone.</p><p>But this 144-ET notation is being explored by Stearns<br/>as a useful notation of the virtual pitch continuum,<br/>and I do think it succeeds admirably well in that<br/>regard.  For Stearns&apos;s compositional techniques, which<br/>include the mixing of 12-, 19-, and 20-eq in one piece,<br/>I think it&apos;s a good solution.</p><p>One of the big advantages it has over 72-eq is that<br/>it provides extremely accurate notation for 11-eq<br/>and 13-eq.  This may not be very important for composers<br/>like you and I who prefer to think ultimately in<br/>terms of (in my case), or in relation to (in your case), JI.</p><p>But for someone like Stearns, who uses non-12-ETs a lot<br/>without being concerned about their rational implications,<br/>I think it&apos;s quite useful to be able to use the same<br/>symbols for a variety of different tunings.</p><p>In this scenario, 144-eq avoids what I considered to<br/>be the biggest problem with Blackwood&apos;s &apos;Microtonal Etudes&apos;<br/>- a separate notation for each ET.</p><p>I think I can agree with Stearns that in a compositional<br/>situation where several different ETs are being used<br/>at once, disregarding rational implications, the ~4-cents<br/>maximum error of 144-eq can be considered negligible,<br/>and its notational simplicity and flexibility is<br/>a big advantage.</p><p>Joseph L. <a href="mailto:Monzo....................monz@juno.com">Monzo....................monz@juno.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/> |&quot;...I had broken thru the lattice barrier...&quot;|<br/> |                            - Erv Wilson     |<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div><h3><a id=2440 href="#2440">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/1999 7:08:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Erlich:]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Partch obtained his full 43-tone system by transposing parts<br/>&gt; &gt; of the tonality diamond to centers other than 1/1.<br/>&gt; &gt; What is important in these transpositions is that the harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; integrity of the each of the diamonds be preserved, not<br/>&gt; &gt; that the complex, secondary ratios be represented well with<br/>&gt; &gt; respect to the 1/1 of the overall system (G).</p><p>It seems that Partch sensed the logic of Constant structures and filled in<br/>the gaps of a 41 tone scale that required two interchangeable notes.<br/>Looking at the added pitches (also all epimores!) he added along<br/>pythagorean lines more than transposing diamond section which he could have<br/>done!
