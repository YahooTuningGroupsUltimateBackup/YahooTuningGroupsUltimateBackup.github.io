This<br/>suggestion apparently received savage response<br/>from the internet addicts who currently<br/>tyrannize the other tuning list, and who<br/>consequently do not have time to actually<br/>listen to or compose music in any of the tunings<br/>they discuss.<br/>    In my hands-on experience composing with<br/>equal temperaments from 5 through 53 and a few<br/>beyond, the answer boils down to &quot;It depends...&quot;<br/>    This never satisfies the arrogant incompetent<br/>ignorami on the tuning list, since they want all<br/>musical experience encapsulated in a single neat<br/>equation -- preferably an equation that doesn&apos;t<br/>stretch their grade school mathematical abilities.<br/>In the real world, however, the rest of the world&apos;s<br/>musical cultures unanimously agree that mathematics<br/>has no connection with music, and whenever you ask<br/>any musician anywhere in the world other than<br/>Europe/North America and India &quot;Why do you use this<br/>tuning?&quot; the answer is *NEVER* &quot;mathematics.&quot;<br/>    Typically you get answers like &quot;It fits my rasa&quot;<br/>(Bali); &quot;Tradition&quot; (China); &quot;Because a goddess<br/>sang that song at the beginning of the world&quot; (Japan);<br/>&quot;Because my guru taught it to me&quot; (Thailand)...and so<br/>on.<br/>    Since the responses of the people who have never<br/>composed in or even heard the tunings they discuss<br/>on the tuning list are contradicted so sharply by<br/>musical reality throughout the non-Western world, we<br/>must look elsewhere than mathematics or the harmonic<br/>series for the answer to Joseph Pehrson&apos;s question.<br/>    ----<br/>    In order of importance, the influences on the<br/>listener&apos;s perception of an (equal tempered) tuning<br/>are:<br/>    [1] The listener&apos;s cultural preconceptions. On a<br/>scale of 1 to 10, this rates a 10. Depending on the<br/>culture, tonal combinations which send one audience<br/>into ecstasy impel other non-acculturated listeners<br/>fleeing with their hands over their ears. Music forms<br/>which sounds &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;obvious&quot; to acculturated<br/>listeners strike listeners from outside the culture<br/>as &quot;noise&quot; and &quot;not even music.&quot;<br/>    [2] The musical style in which the tuning is<br/>used. By employing a sparse polyphonic highly rhythmic<br/>style with percussive timbres, 13/oct can be made to<br/>sound almost entirely like 12 equal. By changing to<br/>a bach chorale style with an organ timbre, 13/oct<br/>can be made to sound like the Tuning From Hell.<br/>    [3] The interaction twixt the timbre and the<br/>tuning and the ear/brain system&apos;s critical bandwidth.<br/>The critical band, about 280 cents in width, is so<br/>important that it impacts on all the ear&apos;s operations--<br/>loudness perception, acoustical roughness, streaming,<br/>just about everything. By changing the timbre of tones<br/>electronically, tonal combination which sound unbearably<br/>rough can be made to sound angelically smooth, and vice<br/>versa.<br/>    [4] Whether or not the tuning contains recognizable<br/>perfect fifths. Moran and Pratt showed in 1926 that the<br/>psychophysical range of the p5th runs from about 680 to<br/>720 cents, but in 9/oct it also runs down to 666.666 cents.<br/>Fifths within this range (except for 9/oct and 18/oct as<br/>2 pairs of 9s) will sound musically functional. p5ths<br/>outside that range will not. This has some important<br/>consequences for musical style and hte overall &quot;sound&quot;<br/>of the tuning. For ETs sans recognizable p5ths (6, 8,<br/>11, 13, 16, 18, 23) triads with near-harmonic-series<br/>timbres sound like diminished chords moving by diminished<br/>or agumented intervals -- not a strong recipe for<br/>tonal closure or convincing stable harmonic progressions<br/>that strongly establish a sense of tonality.<br/>   [5] The overall range of the ET. Beyond about 29 - 36<br/>tones per octave, successive equal temperaments become<br/>inditistinguishable from one another. That is to say,<br/>if you play a piece composed in 31 equal in the closest<br/>pitches in 34 equal, it&apos;s almost impossible to hear any<br/>musical difference. If you do the same for (say) 41 and 43,<br/>it IS impossible to reliably hear a difference.<br/>   Thus, Joseph Pehrson is onto something important in<br/>stressing the overall size of the individual scale step<br/>in a tuning. There is a crucial difference twixt tunings<br/>larger than 23/oct -- they ALL boast recognizable p5ths.<br/>Moreover, the &quot;region of blurring&quot; which begins around 31/oct,<br/>renders nearby tunings largely impossible to distinguish<br/>from one another.<br/>   These two properties mean that tunings beyond 23/oct<br/>differ drastically from those below 23/oct. There is no<br/>way of mistaking a very small ET from another nearby<br/>one -- 5 and 6 equal sound radically different. Not so<br/>51 and 56 equal, which sound essentially identical in<br/>real music in the real world.<br/>    OF the ET tunings from 5 - 23 inclusive, a total of<br/>6 out of that 19 (or about 1/3) have no recognizable<br/>pths. Of the ET tunings from 23 equal to infinity 100%<br/>have recognizable perfect fifths. That&apos;s a huge<br/>difference, and it&apos;s easily audible even to a novice.<br/>    Since these things are easy to hear, it stands to<br/>reason that the internet addicts who tyrannize the<br/>other tuning lists by hurling insults and shouting lies<br/>would be completely unaware of them. Naturally, you must<br/>actually *LISTEN* to music in these tunings to hear<br/>these things -- and that, the internet addicts who<br/>tyrannize the other tuning list have no time for. Instead,<br/>like Paul &quot;All Math, No Music&quot; Erlich and Dave &quot;All<br/>Idle Speculations, No Composition&quot; Keenan, these<br/>characters prefer to &quot;correct&quot; other people&apos;s posts<br/>with &quot;corrections&quot; which turn out to be riddled with<br/>errors, and laughably incorrect to boot to anyone who<br/>has actually listened to or composed music in the tunings<br/>concerned.<br/>   So the bottom line is that in the extremes, the<br/>individual step has a tremendous influence on the<br/>listener&apos;s perception of ETs. Mind you -- at the<br/>*extremes*. As we move from 5/oct to 72/oct, there&apos;s<br/>a drastic audible difference that anyone (except the<br/>people who never compose or listen to microtonal<br/>music on the other tuning list) can hear. However,<br/>going from 31 to 32 equal is not taking this question<br/>to extremes, and accordingly there will be little<br/>difference twixt such tunings. Between 5 equal and<br/>72 equal, yes -- between the ultra-small and utlra-large<br/>scale step range, yes...but between, say, 27 and 29<br/>equal, or 14 and 15 equal, no.<br/>   As always, it&apos;s more complex than you&apos;d expect.<br/>Fortunately for composers and listeners, and to the<br/>eternal humiliation of the amusical numerologists<br/>who tyrannize the other tuning list.<br/>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3><a id=1131 href="#1131">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>10/27/2001 10:36:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., xed@e... wrote:</p><p><a href="/crazy_music/topicId_1130.html#1130">/crazy_music/topicId_1130.html#1130</a></p><p>&gt; FROM: mclaren<br/>&gt; TO: New Practical Microtonality List<br/>&gt; SUBJECT: Number of tones per octave<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks so much, Brian, for your response on this.  Just from<br/>*listening* it seemed that the step-size was, on the overall, an<br/>*extremely* important characteristic of different ETs... at least, as<br/>you say, between the extremes.  Thanks for your elaboration<br/>concerning the inclusion of the perfect fifth in the larger ETs...  I<br/>remember this being on your CD &quot;Introduction to Microtonality&quot; as<br/>well, but it was useful to be reminded of it and its ramifications.<br/>Perhaps the idea of step-size variation in xenharmonic music seems<br/>overly obvious to some.  However, in composing sometimes the<br/>*obvious* characteristics seem at least as important as the arcane...<br/>at least as far as *listeners* are concerned!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
