There is a general decrease in<br/>dissonance as n gets larger (and the freq of the lower tone decreases). The<br/>uniformity just isn&apos;t there that there is for a fixed lower tone. I&apos;m<br/>fairly convinced that consonance is the same for all intervals sharing d<br/>when the frequency of d is fixed and the interval is wider than the<br/>roughness curve.</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>Daniel</p></div>
