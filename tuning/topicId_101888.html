Why is it acceptable for them to share the same name? AFAIK the precise conditions have never been spelled out anywhere, so I&apos;m going to give it a shot:</p><p>1. Temperaments with the same name must have the same rank. (It might be tempting to call both the 2.3.7 64/63 linear temperament and the <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 64/63 planar temperament &quot;archytas&quot;, for example, but I don&apos;t think this is currently done.)</p><p>2. Temperaments with the same name must agree perfectly on their common subgroup. That is, the mappings for all primes (or other basis elements) must be identical.</p><p>3. The common subgroup temperament must not be contorted or reduced in rank, and it must also share the same name.</p><p>These conditions guarantee that temperaments with the same name can always be derived, from some simplest possible version of that temperament, by mapping new primes to intervals that *already exist* in the temperament.</p><p>When I go from 5-limit meantone to 7-limit meantone, I&apos;m not adding any new notes or intervals to 5-limit meantone. I&apos;m just saying that the previously existing interval of an augmented sixth is now going to represent 7/4 in addition to all the 5-limit intervals it represented before.</p><p>Here are some examples of things this *disallows*:</p><p>* Consider Bohlen-Pierce (the rank-2 one) and bohpier. Bohlen-Pierce is 3.5.7 and bohpier is <a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a>, so their common subgroup is 3.5.7. But bohpier is rank-1 if restricted to the 3.5.7 subgroup, while Bohlen-Pierce is still rank-2 on that subgroup. This violates condition 2, so they must have different names.</p><p>* Consider tutone, a 2.9.5.7.11 temperament with the same commas as meantone. In meantone, 9 is mapped to -2 generators plus some octaves, but in tutone, 9 is mapped to 1 generator plus some octaves. This violates condition 2, so they must have different names.</p><p>* Consider bridgetown (a 2.3.11/5.13/5 temperament) and semiphore (a 2.3.7 temperament). These *do* agree perfectly on their common subgroup of 2.3, satisfying condition 2, but the common subgroup temperament is contorted Pythagorean, so this fails condition 3.</p><p>Note that according to these conditions, some familiar temperaments would be allowed to share names even though they currently don&apos;t. For example, slendric is not forbidden from being called &quot;2.3.7 rodan&quot;, or &quot;2.3.7 mothra&quot; or even &quot;2.3.7 gorgo&quot;. That it currently has the unique name &quot;slendric&quot; is totally fine - these conditions only say when two temperaments are *allowed* to have the same name. It&apos;s never *required*.</p><p>If these conditions are acceptable to everybody, then that&apos;s great because the name of the <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> temperament tempering out 55/54 and 100/99 can be simply &quot;porcupine&quot;, which is the only name that ever made sense for it.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2011 11:06:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If these conditions are acceptable to everybody, then that&apos;s great because the name of the <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> temperament tempering out 55/54 and 100/99 can be simply &quot;porcupine&quot;, which is the only name that ever made sense for it.</p><p>I think it&apos;s very confusing to call it simply &quot;porcupine&quot; rather than &quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> porcupine&quot;.

Already exist... with what complexity?</p><p>I wasn&apos;t thinking of complexity, I was thinking of the more obvious fact that some extensions keep all the generators and mappings of the &quot;original&quot; primes the same, whereas others split generators into smaller parts (or otherwise mangle them) and change all the mappings.</p><p>For example, let&apos;s say I want to extend 5-limit meantone to include the prime 7. There are many different ways to do this, but they fall into two categories.</p><p>In the first category we have 7-limit temperaments that coincide perfectly with meantone in the 5-limit. This means they take some interval that already exists in meantone and call it the 7th harmonic. Examples:</p><p>* If 7/4 is represented as a minor seventh (an interval which already exists in 5-limit meantone), then you get dominant.<br/>* If 7/4 is represented as an augmented sixth, you get 7-limit meantone.<br/>* If 7/4 is represented as a diminished seventh, you get flattone.</p><p>In the second category we have 7-limit temperaments that, when restricted to the 5 limit, are contorted versions of meantone rather than meantone itself. This means they add new intervals to 5-limit meantone that didn&apos;t originally belong to it and cannot be described in meantone-based nomenclature (e.g. &quot;augmented sixth&quot;). Examples:</p><p>* Godzilla splits the perfect fourth into two equal parts. Any interval that&apos;s an odd number of these parts is not an ordinary meantone interval, it&apos;s something new.<br/>* Cynder splits the perfect fifth into three equal parts. Now only one out of every three intervals is a familiar meantone one.<br/>* Injera splits the octave into two equal parts.</p><p>I think it&apos;s pretty darn important that the name &quot;meantone&quot; be bestowed only on an extension in the first category, never the second category.</p><p>You seem to be making the argument that since all the extensions in both categories temper out 81/80, they&apos;re all equally valid candidates for the name &quot;meantone&quot; because they&apos;re compatible with it. I can think of three good reasons to insist on extensions in the first category, though:</p><p>* Equal temperaments: Many people like to perform in equal temperaments. If an equal temperament supports meantone, then it&apos;s guaranteed to support all extensions in the first category to some extent, but not those in the second category. For example, 12edo supports meantone, therefore it also supports dominant, 7-limit meantone, and flattone (albeit with the second-best mapping for 7). In contrast, it does not support godzilla or cynder at all (unless you use a worse mapping for 3, which is insane).</p><p>* Notation and nomenclature: If you have a notation system worked out for some rank-2 temperament, that system automatically works for all extensions in the first category, but not the second. Dominant, 7-limit meantone, and flattone can all be notated with standard meantone-based notation. But how can you use standard notation to notate godzilla? The generator is neither a major second nor a minor third, nor any other meantone interval.</p><p>* MOS scales: The cardinalities of MOS (and MODMOS!) scales of extensions in the first category are closely related to those of 5-limit meantone (only changing for higher numbers of notes if the optimum tuning changes too much), but the cardinalities of those in the second category are totally different.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2011 10:22:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I definitely prefer &quot;<a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a> porcupine&quot;, for the same reason<br/>&gt; &gt; that I like the name &quot;7-limit meantone&quot; rather than &quot;smeantone&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; or &quot;meanntone&quot; or whatever.

Feasible searching for commas depends on an error<br/>weighting that essentially lets us ignore primes above<br/>some number, like 31.

If we choose the relative steepness<br/>of these two weighting functions to align with typical<br/>work in the field that uses hard cutoffs (prime limits<br/>and hard complexity cutoffs), a comma will be easier to<br/>find than a val.
