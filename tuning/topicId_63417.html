Other<br/>people are either opposed to any approximation at all, or willing to<br/>accept that getting to within 0.00001 cents of the JI interval is not<br/>actually necessary. This is far more accuracy than the MIDI Tuning<br/>Standard, for instance, even allows. It is of a degree of accuracy<br/>that doing acoustical experiments becomes difficult, and something<br/>probably best left to something like Csound. A single beat of a C-G<br/>interval, with the C at 256 Hz, would take 11 hours to complete. By<br/>comparison, 306 would take 13 minutes, and 53 66 seconds; the last is<br/>still slow enough that it already would give problems. The MIDI tuning<br/>standard, by the way, can in theory make the beat 40 minutes long, but<br/>no longer.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Take 53, and make the circle close exactly, and you are in<br/>&gt; &gt; business.</p><p>&gt; simply tune in practice a few (2^(31/53))^n artificial created 5ths<br/>&gt; and hear yourself how the errors accumulate:</p><p>But the *only* intervals you can test with your ears are fourths,<br/>fifths and their octave equivalents, or things which *approximate* to<br/>a consonant interval. Because the introduction of the dreaded a-word<br/>is *required*, I can&apos;t see any way your idea can make genuine musical<br/>sense. It&apos;s true that after eight fourths along the chain of fourths,<br/>you get to an interval you can test with your hearing which is not a<br/>fifth or a fourth. It&apos;s not a just major third, either, since it&apos;s<br/>1.95 cents flat. 53 differs in that it has this interval 1.41 cents<br/>flat. This makes a triad with 53 sound slightly different, but only<br/>very slightly, and then because it is *more* in tune.</p><p>&gt; The intermediate results become more and more of of tune<br/>&gt; by each step arising detuned<br/>&gt; versus the correct chain of just (3/2)^n pure 5ths.</p><p>This is a purely theoretical claim, not one based on hearing. Yes, 53<br/>gradually moves away from the Pythagorean chain, but why is the<br/>Pythagorean chain right and 53 wrong? Your ears won&apos;t tell you that.</p><p>&gt; Retrace that by experiment in order to comprehend that acoustical too.<br/>&gt; Then you have a clue of my own acustics experiments.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it is possible you came to this conclusion based on<br/>acoustic experiments with consonant intervals; instead, you seem to be<br/>concerned with listening to commas. But whether the Pythagorean comma<br/>and the 41-circle comma are precisely the same or not is irrelevant so<br/>far as music goes, so your acoustic experiment is meaningless. Why is<br/>the JI tuning musically better? Better in what way?</p><p>&gt; Learn to distingusih the different commas one from the other:<br/>&gt; 3^12/2^19  ~23.4 cents 13 steps in 665 (~~12 in 612)<br/>&gt; 2^65/3^41  ~19.8 cents 11 steps in 665 (~~10 in 612)<br/>&gt; instead of assuming them fuzzily equal,</p><p>I&apos;m not assuming them to be equal. They in fact *are* equal if you<br/>tune the fifth 0.068 cents flat, and close the circle of fifths, but<br/>this fact has to do with the structural organization of music in a<br/>tuning system (the 53 circle closes) not with any &quot;acoustic<br/>phenonmenon&quot;. They are not intervals having their own, independent<br/>musical life, whose exact tuning matters.</p><p>&gt; i&apos;m fully aware in respecting Jing-Fangs comma discrimination<br/>&gt; 3^53/2^84 ~3.6 cents ~2 steps in 665 (or 612 too)<br/>&gt; as mental in mind as acustical by ears.</p><p>It&apos;s acoustic in the sense you can hear it. It&apos;s not acoustic in the<br/>sense your ears will tell you what size it ought to be.</p><p>&gt; Already Moritz Wilhelm Drobisch gained<br/>&gt; the same accuracy of discrimination in the 19. century<br/>&gt; <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Wilhelm_Drobisch">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Wilhelm_Drobisch</a><br/>&gt; theoretical and practical.</p><p>Looks like an English page on Drobisch should be added to Wikipedia,<br/>but the German page doesn&apos;t say anything relevant.</p><p>&gt; If you alreay have grasped 612,<br/>&gt; why not the better choice?<br/>&gt; Superior 665!</p><p>Inferior 665 if we go beyond the 3-limit.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Why would anyone care to make the Pythagorean ratios exact and<br/>&gt;ignore<br/>&gt; &gt; all others?<br/>&gt; 5 arises from 3^-8, 7 from 3^-14, 11 from 3^23 ...........<br/>&gt; already in 53P.</p><p>Terrific. 5 arises from 3^-314, 7 from 3^-67, 11 from 3^129 in 665.<br/>These are not easy to get to, and when you do get to them they are not<br/>as accurately tuned as you seem to want. 5 is 1/7 cent flat, 7 is 1/5<br/>cent sharp, and 11 is 6/7 cents sharp. That&apos;s good enough for many<br/>people, but not for JI advocates. Moreover, pure fifths have the *same<br/>problem*.</p><p>&gt; Are you doubting about my championship of 665?</p><p>I&apos;m talking specifically about fifths and listening tests.</p><p>&gt; Counterexample:<br/>&gt; Just try to tune my Werckmeister concept in an real acustic organ:<br/>&gt; @ A4=456 Hz as exact by ear as you are able, as your ears can:</p><p>I&apos;d like to investigate this, but you give more than one number per<br/>note. They could also be reduced to the same octave. If I ignore the<br/>stuff in parenthesis, I get</p><p>! spars.scl<br/>Sparschuh circulating scale<br/>12<br/>!<br/>2304/2173<br/>2448/2173<br/>2592/2173<br/>2736/2173<br/>2916/2173<br/>3072/2173<br/>80/53<br/>3456/2173<br/>3648/2173<br/>3888/2173<br/>4104/2173<br/>2</p><p>Is this what you wanted? 665-et does not stand out as a particularly<br/>great way to approximate this scale, which is 53-limit. I also don&apos;t<br/>see why it is a &quot;Werckmeister concept&quot;, with one flat and one sharp<br/>fifth, so that I suspect I&apos;ve gotten it a little wrong.</p></div><h3><a id=63430 href="#63430">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2006 7:20:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; probably best left to something like Csound.
