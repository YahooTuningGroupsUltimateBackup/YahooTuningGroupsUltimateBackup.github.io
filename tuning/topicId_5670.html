The term &quot;fifthtone&quot; may be more specific than &quot;diesis,&quot; which can<br/>refer among other things to a Pythagorean diatonic semitone at 256:243<br/>(the usual limma). At the same time, it is more accurately descriptive<br/>than &quot;quartertone&quot; for Renaissance intervals equal to about 1/5-tone.</p><p>3. This 128:125 interval is sometimes known more specifically as the<br/>&quot;lesser diesis,&quot; the &quot;greater diesis&quot; being the difference between<br/>four pure 6:5 minor thirds and a 2:1 octave, 648:625 or ~62.57 cents.<br/>In the Greek enharmonic genus, a semitone is divided into two dieses,<br/>~45.11 cents each if we take the semitone as a Pythagorean limma of<br/>256:243 or ~90.22 cents.</p><p>4. See, for example, Mark Lindley, &quot;Temperaments,&quot; _New Grove<br/>Dictionary of Music and Musicians_ 18:660-674, ed. Stanley Sadie,<br/>(Washington, DC: Grove&apos;s Dictionaries of Music, 1980), ISBN<br/>0333231112, at 666. In the standard 16th-century modal system, G#<br/>serves for example as a major third above the final of E Phrygian,<br/>while Eb permits a fluid degree E/Eb in G Dorian with Bb signature, a<br/>transposed equivalent of B/Bb in D Dorian.</p><p>5.

From a modern perspective oriented to medieval as well as<br/>Renaissance music, this use of a small cadential semitone might<br/>suggest the Pythagorean tuning of the 13th-14th centuries, where<br/>relatively concordant but active and unstable thirds and sixths<br/>&quot;strive&quot; toward stable intervals such as fifths and octaves. Combining<br/>such compact semitones with pure or near-pure thirds, however,<br/>requires &quot;unusual&quot; intervals such as the 6/5-tone steps in this<br/>example.</p><p>11.

Patrizio Barbieri, Musurgiana 24 (Lucca: Libreria<br/>Musicale Italiana, 1991), ISSN 1121-0508, ISBN 88-7096-026-9. This<br/>fascimile edition includes a very helpful commentary in Italian and<br/>English.</p><p>12. On such 19-note instruments and their music around 1600, see<br/>Barbieri&apos;s commentary, ibid. pp. XLIX-L. In this music based on a<br/>range of Gb-B#, an occasional enharmonic note may arise at either end<br/>of the chain. Thus Gesualdo, in one of his vocal madrigals, uses a Cb<br/>(Vicentino&apos;s B*), while a keyboard composition by Giovanni Maria<br/>Trabaci from the same era has an optional F## as a major third to D#,<br/>with the performer invited to substitute a minor third F# on a usual<br/>&quot;chromatic&quot; instrument. On Gesualdo&apos;s accidentals, see Glenn Watkins,<br/>_Gesualdo: The Man and His Music_ (Chapel Hill: University of North<br/>Carolina Press, 1973), pp. 194-196. Stella entered Gesualdo&apos;s service<br/>in 1594, see Barbieri, ibid. p. XXXIV.</p><p>13. If this is the correct interpretation, then Vicentino&apos;s use of<br/>these keys, or of all 17 keys of the second manual in an alternate<br/>tuning based on &quot;just fifths&quot; with the basic 19 notes of the first<br/>manual (e.g. Maniates and Palisca, n. 1 above, 333-334 and commentary<br/>at xlix-l, and Tiella, n. 1 above, Fig. 5), might fit the concept of<br/>&quot;adaptive just intonation&quot; discussed by modern theorists such as Paul<br/>Erlich. In such a system, the melodic steps of the gamut are tuned in<br/>a scheme such as meantone, but concords with pure ratios are placed<br/>above these steps.</p><p>14.

Ibid. at 72, and Barbieri&apos;s interpretation at XLVI-XLVII and<br/>Fig. 2; my diagram is based on ranks consistently 1/5-tone apart, with<br/>Eh (E+4/5) equivalent to Vicentino&apos;s F*, and Bh to C*. If Colonna&apos;s Cb<br/>and Fb on Rank 4 are emended to C and F, as Barbieri and I have done,<br/>this keeps the symmetry of the ranks.</p><p>17. J. Murray Barbour, _Tuning and Temperament: A Historical<br/>Survey_ (East Lansing: Michigan State College Press, 1953), p. 119.</p><p>18. E.g. C-C*-C#-Db-D (LF-SF-LF-CS); G*-G#-Ab-A-A* (SF-LF-CS-LF);<br/>E-E*-F-F*-F# (LF-CS-LF-SF); and Gb-G-G*-G#-Ab (CS-LF-SF-LF).</p><p>19. Colonna, n. 12 above, at 101-102, and Barbieri&apos;s commentary at LI<br/>and transcription at LXVI-LXVII.</p><p>20. Ibid., XL-XLIII, where Barbieri explains Colonna&apos;s principle that<br/>a ratio is admissable if its smaller term forms an acceptable concord<br/>with the difference of the two terms, e.g. 17:12, 12:(17-12) = 12:5 (a<br/>just minor tenth); prime factors include &quot;3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and 17.&quot;</p><p>21. See Maniates and Palisca, n. 1 above, pp. 336-340, where Vicentino<br/>expresses the viewpoint that while the proximate minor thirds and<br/>sixths (here E4-C*5) are acceptable concords, proximate major thirds<br/>and sixths (here E4-Db5) are &quot;less tolerable&quot; or even &quot;harsh,&quot;<br/>although he does not categorically exclude them. In his partial<br/>madrigal _Madonna, il poco dolce_, he has a passing sonority of minim<br/>or half-note duration B3-F#3-B4-Eb4, ibid. at 214-217 at 216 m. 31,<br/>discussed at lv; facsimile in Lowinsky, n. 1 above, 68v-69r. This<br/>sonority includes both the proximate major third or tenth B3-Eb4 and<br/>the proximate major sixth F#3-Eb4, and occurs at the word _pianger_,<br/>&quot;to weep.&quot; Colonna&apos;s G-C*, a diesis wider than a usual fourth, does<br/>seem to me a vertical interval uncharacteristic of Vicentino.</p><p>22. While I find this example pleasant, and milder than Colonna&apos;s (the<br/>fourths between the upper voices remaining unaltered), Vicentino says<br/>that the &quot;minimal third&quot; a diesis smaller than minor (here Gb-A, first<br/>sonority) is generally &quot;discordant&quot; and should be &quot;set aside&quot; like the<br/>proximate major sixth, pp. 339-340. To my ears, this interval (~269.21<br/>cents) near 7:6 (~266.87 cents) is rather concordant; here it is<br/>combined with the augmented fifth Gb-D, a not too unusual interval in<br/>14th-century music. Since the LF-SF-LF motion in the lowest part<br/>(Gb-F#-F*-F) leads to the diatonic semitone F-E, the total descent<br/>Gb-E is a curious 6/5-tone, used as a direct melodic interval in<br/>Bertrand&apos;s cadence cited in Section 1 and n. 9.</p><p>23. See nn. 7-8.</p><p>24. This term is borrowed from physics and chemistry. As used here,<br/>&quot;chirality&quot; in 1/4-comma meantone involves a distinction equal to that<br/>between 31 tempered fifths and a pure 2:1 octave, or between the large<br/>and small fifthtones, ~6.07 cents. The &quot;handedness&quot; metaphor may<br/>suggest the relationship between pairs of intervals such as the large<br/>fifthtone (12 fifths down) and the small fifthtone (19 fifths up); or<br/>the larger proximate minor third (15 fifths down) and the smaller one<br/>(16 fifths up).</p><p>25. My special thanks to Ed Foote, musician, advocate, and tuner<br/>extraordinaire, for inspiring this section.</p><p>26. On Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo tuning, views have varied. Barbour,<br/>n. 17 above, pp. 117-119, describes this tuning as &quot;a clever method of<br/>extending the usual meantone temperament of 1/4 comma,&quot; and asserts<br/>that this temperament, the &quot;common practice&quot; of the time, &quot;is<br/>undoubtedly what Vicentino used.&quot; Tiella also takes this view, and<br/>gives values in cents for the notes of the instrument based on this<br/>tuning. However, Maniates and Palisca, n. 1 above, Appendix VII,<br/>pp. 452-453, give rounded values in cents for 31-tet, and Kaufmann,<br/>n. 1 above, pp. 87-88, 93-94, and Tables I and II, adopts the view of<br/>Lemme Rossi, _Sistema musico_ (1666), that Vicentino&apos;s tuning is<br/>31-tet rather than the very closely related 1/4-comma. The scale file<br/>vicentino1.scl from <a href="http://scales.zip">scales.zip</a>, an archive of scale data for Manuel op<br/>de Coul&apos;s Scala computer program, likewise gives the tuning as 31-tet.<br/>Among those favoring 1/4-comma, views of chirality vary, although<br/>Vicentino&apos;s own tuning procedure, Maniates and Palisca, pp. 332-333,<br/>specifies Cb-D###, with B* tuned a fifth down from Gb, but all other<br/>notes of the enharmonic fifth and fourth ranks up from B# (Gb*-E*),<br/>the fifth rank (Gb*-Bb*=F##-A##) being tuned _before_ the remaining<br/>notes of the fourth (F*-E*=E##-D###). Barbour, p. 118, says that the<br/>fourth rank adds flats (i.e. B*-F*=Cb-Gbb), while the fifth rank adds<br/>sharps (i.e. Gb*-Bb*=F##-A##), for a tuning of Gbb-A## -- following<br/>Vicentino&apos;s scheme for the fifth rank and for B*=Cb, but not for the<br/>other notes of the fourth rank. Tiella, in his Fig. 4, shows values in<br/>rounded cents which would define a 1/4-comma tuning with all 12 notes<br/>of the fourth and fifth ranks tuned as flats (Gb*-B*=Abbb-Cb), or<br/>Abbb-B#. This scheme would be identical to the 24-note tuning Eb*-G#<br/>described here plus Gb*-Ab*(Abbb-Bbbb) and D#-B# to complete a 31-note<br/>division; corresponding notes on the two manuals, as Tiella&apos;s diagram<br/>shows, are consistently a 128:125 diesis or large fifthtone apart (a<br/>rounded 41 cents). While it is gratifying to find an earlier precedent<br/>for my 24-note scheme with its flat chirality, Vicentino&apos;s scheme is<br/>different.</p><p>27. Fifths are tempered by ~5.38 cents in 1/4-comma, and ~5.18 cents<br/>in 31-tet. This excellent approximation is noted, for example, by<br/>Barbour, n. 17 above, pp. 117-119, citing also the calculations of the<br/>17th-century Netherlands theorist Christian Huyghens that the two<br/>tunings differ by no more than &quot;1/110 comma.&quot; Kaufmann, n. 1 above,<br/>pp. 87-88 and 93-94, cites Lemme Rossi on the similarities, and noting<br/>&quot;how closely the two tunings are related,&quot; states at p. 87: &quot;The 1/4<br/>comma temperament will thus be used for the tuning of the fifths in<br/>the remaining orders of the _archicembalo_&quot; (although values in cents<br/>are given for 31-tet). Barbieri&apos;s commentary in Colonna, n. 12 above,<br/>at XLVII and XLIX, refers to 1/4-comma as &quot;the most common tuning in<br/>the early seventeenth century&quot; and notes that 31-tet is &quot;excellently<br/>approximated&quot; by this tuning.</p><p>28. Maniates and Palisca, n. 1 above, pp. 331-332.</p><p>29. Colonna, n. 12 above, e.g. at 69, and Barbieri&apos;s commentary at<br/>XLIX.</p><p>30. Lindley, n. 4 above, at 662, and his &quot;Early Sixteenth-century<br/>Keyboard Temperaments, _Musica Disciplina_ 28:129-151 (1974), with<br/>pp. 139-144 on Aaron, and a statement at p. 150 and n. 23 that &quot;one<br/>should not assume _a priori_ that it was 1/4-comma meantone in<br/>particular that Nicola Vicentino necessarily had in mind&quot; for the<br/>standard tuning of the first two ranks of his instrument. In my view,<br/>one can propose 1/4-comma as an historically likely realization of<br/>Vicentino&apos;s 31-note division while joining Lindley in recognizing the<br/>variety of Renaissance meantone tunings. Incidentally, at 150 n. 23,<br/>Lindley cites Barber&apos;s puzzlement with part of Vicentino&apos;s scheme;<br/>Barber&apos;s perplexity may have resulted from a confusion in his sources<br/>of Vicentino&apos;s tuning based on a 31-note division of the octave and<br/>his alternative tuning with the notes of the second manual providing<br/>just fifths to those of the first (see n. 13 above).</p><p>31. Vicentino describes intervals of a &quot;minor diesis&quot; (1/5-tone),<br/>&quot;major diesis&quot; (2/5-tone, a chromatic semitone), and &quot;major semitone&quot;<br/>(3/5-tone, a diatonic semitone); and Colonna, n. 12 above, at 103,<br/>prefaces the music for his &quot;example of circulation&quot; with a statement<br/>that this composition demonstrates that &quot;our division of the tone into<br/>five intervals&quot; is true. In fact, Vicentino&apos;s model can be as useful<br/>in extended 1/4-comma as in 31-tet for many purposes (e.g. counting a<br/>&quot;proximate minor third&quot; such as C-Eb or C*-E as 9/5 of a tone); and<br/>either tuning permits Colonna&apos;s full circulation. Playing Colonna&apos;s<br/>piece on his instrument or Vicentino&apos;s in 1/4-comma, we would<br/>encounter a few sonorities of the kind described near the end of<br/>Section 3, with thirds of &quot;opposite chirality&quot; (major thirds 27 fifths<br/>down instead of four fifths up, ~392.38 cents; minor thirds 28 fifths<br/>up instead of three fifths down, ~304.20 cents). Intriguingly, we<br/>would also encounter one fifth of opposite chirality (30 fifths down<br/>rather than one fifth up), an almost pure interval of ~702.65 cents,<br/>wider than a just 3:2 (~701.955 cents) by the difference between the<br/>almost perfectly balanced factors of chirality and usual tempering,<br/>(~6.07 - ~5.38) or ~.69 cents. With Vicentino&apos;s tuning scheme of<br/>Cb-D###, for example, we would encounter this near-pure fifth<br/>D###3-Cb4, and likewise the near-pure fourth Cb4-D###4, at the<br/>sonority E*3-B*3-E*4-Ab4 (Colonna, ibid. at 105, m.2 of this page),<br/>realized as D###3-Cb4-D###4-Ab4, with the major tenth and third<br/>D###3-Ab4 and D###4-Ab4 also of opposite chirality, but the major<br/>sixth Cb4-Ab4 a usual meantone interval (as the spelling suggests).<br/>How noticeable these variations of chirality would be among those of<br/>the tuning process over 31 notes remains an interesting question, but<br/>in any case they seem no barrier to Colonna&apos;s full &quot;circulation.&quot;</p><p>32. For Bernard&apos;s piece, see n. 6 above; since this piece does not use<br/>G#, one could also play it in Ab-C#/Ab*-Db. For Vicentino&apos;s example,<br/>see Maniates and Palisca, n. 1 above, pp. 209-210, with commentary at<br/>lii-liii, and fascimile, Lowinsky, n. 1 above, 67r.; this excerpt<br/>likewise does not use G#.</p><p>33. Maniates and Palisca, ibid., pp. 211-213, with commentary at<br/>liii-lv, and facsimile, Lowinsky, ibid., 67v-68r. In a pinch, one<br/>might attempt this piece in Eb-G#/Eb*-Ab by disregarding the<br/>enharmonic inflections in all parts at m. 14 of the transcription,<br/>changing Ab*2-Ab*3-Eb*4-C*4 to Ab2-Ab3-Eb4-C4 (upper voices crossed).<br/>Vicentino&apos;s own remarks about optionally performing in &quot;mixed&quot; genera<br/>would seem to permit such an expedient, and here I see no obvious<br/>vertical or melodic contraindications.</p><p>34. For _Madonna, il poco dolce_, see Maniates and Palisca, ibid.,<br/>pp. 214-217, and fascimile, Lowinsky, n. 1 above, 68v-69r; for _Musica<br/>prisca caput_, see n. 5 above.
