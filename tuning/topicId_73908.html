It seems this topic struck a chord with a few people. Thank you<br/>&gt;   all for your suggestions. If I wind up having to write this myself,<br/>&gt;   I&apos;ll certainly incorporate your ideas on how to go about it. I&apos;m<br/>&gt;   keeping all of your replies in a folder.</p><p>Dear Robin,</p><p>Please let me thank you for giving us the opportunity to share one of<br/>the greatest responsibilities we have: to help others form their own<br/>artistic judgments and enjoy the vast range of world musics in JI and<br/>other intonation systems.</p><p>I feel that it is very important, in letting students experience a<br/>sample of this vast diversity, here with a main focus on simple or<br/>complex just ratios, but not excluding various other styles of tuning<br/>which may lend a bit of perspective.</p><p>This should also be a lesson in tolerance and empathy. For example,<br/>just about _any_ world musical tradition, emphatically including the<br/>classical composed tradition of Western Europe at any historical era,<br/>could be viewed as &quot;unnaturally limited.&quot;</p><p>For example, in classical Western European music from the medieval era<br/>to the 19th century, there are the familiar whole-tone and semitone<br/>steps. In Near Eastern traditions (Arabic, Persian, Kurdish, and<br/>Turkish) there are likewise these familiar steps, but also neutral or<br/>&quot;middle&quot; seconds and other intervals somewhere between major and<br/>minor. These steps may often follow or approximate just ratios like<br/>14:13, 13:12, or 12:11. Hearing and recognizing them is a bit like<br/>learning the sounds of an unfamiliar language, if one has not grown up<br/>in such a tradition.</p><p>Someone from one of these cultures might argue: &quot;How is it that<br/>someone has indoctrinated you so that you have not followed the<br/>natural course of using these beautiful melodic intervals, which the<br/>great lutenist Mansur Zalzal made popular in the 8th centuries.<br/>What has held you people back 1200 years?&quot;</p><p>We understand that each culture has developed in its own way, so that<br/>for people in each some just (as well as tempered!) intervals may seem<br/>familiar and &quot;natural,&quot; others strange or less inviting. Pythagorean<br/>intonation, favored at various times and places, is simply a system<br/>for tuning in pure 3:2 fifths and 4:3 fourths. In Europe and also Near<br/>Eastern traditions influenced by the Greek tradition, this is<br/>associated with Pythagoras and his followers. In China or Japan, it<br/>has deep roots also. It&apos;s neither a great conspiracy nor a universal<br/>solution to all musical problems, just one kind of JI approach, and a<br/>very easy one to tune.</p><p>For example, getting back to the Near East, many intervals such as<br/>major or minor thirds are often played at or near Pythagorean sizes,<br/>because fretted instruments are often tuned in pure fifths and<br/>fourths. However, the middle or neutral intervals I mentioned have<br/>another basis, and sometimes we have major or minor thirds at a<br/>variety of ratios. One of the first lessons of JI is that there are<br/>often lots of ways to tune an interval.</p><p>One thing I would urge: if a tuning system is taught, students should<br/>have an opportunity to hear some musical pieces, or at least examples<br/>of actual passages or progressions, where that system fits the music.<br/>For example, with Pythagorean, you could use some Chinese or Japanese<br/>music showing this kind of intonation; or 12th-14th century European<br/>music performed in this style. On a keyboard, it would be good to know<br/>at least a few simple cadences which make the available sizes of<br/>intervals move in a musically effective way. This goes for other just<br/>tunings also.</p><p>&gt;   I am still looking for a ready made plan to use, however. I know there<br/>&gt;   must be an elementary school math or music teacher on this list???<br/>&gt;   Please!!!!</p><p>&gt;   Thanks again,<br/>&gt;   Robin</p><p>As a very amateur and uncredentialed educator, maybe I could offer to<br/>help develop something, with feedback welcome from teachers or others<br/>in making things comprehensible to ordinary sane people, including<br/>younger ones &lt;grin&gt;.  There&apos;s lots of music on the Web to supplement<br/>whatever instruments or recordings might be available in class.</p><p>Please feel free to contact me via e-mail: this could be a great<br/>learning experience for us all.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=73927 href="#73927">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@polettipiano.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2007 11:39:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Margo addressed her post thusly:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Robin,</p><p>Though I&apos;m not so dense as to fail to realize that a lot of it is<br/>actually a bit of finger waving at me for having spoken negatively<br/>about Pythagorean tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I feel that it is very important, in letting students experience a<br/>&gt; sample of this vast diversity, here with a main focus on simple or<br/>&gt; complex just ratios, but not excluding various other styles of tuning<br/>&gt; which may lend a bit of perspective.</p><p>I agree completely, though they first have to get a grip on the basic<br/>concept. And that means getting a handle on overtone congruence as the<br/>arbiter of interval size, at least up to 5-limit. As far as I&apos;m<br/>concerned, if you want to push their conceptual envelopes, it would be<br/>far better to carry on exploring the universe of intervals to be found<br/>within a single tone, to 7-limit and 11-limit, than to introduce some<br/>unnatural system like Pythagorean.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This should also be a lesson in tolerance and empathy.</p><p>A sort of political correctness in intonation theory?</p><p>;-)</p><p>&gt; For example,<br/>&gt; just about _any_ world musical tradition, emphatically including the<br/>&gt; classical composed tradition of Western Europe at any historical era,<br/>&gt; could be viewed as &quot;unnaturally limited.&quot;</p><p>Of course, but it all depends on how you slice it. If the basic mode<br/>of approach AT THE MOMENT is JI, then Pythag is a limited unnatural<br/>system because it replaces the natural tuning of the major and minor<br/>third (and their inversions) and sevenths and so on if you want to go<br/>further by those dissonant intervals which only appear when one uses<br/>the unnatural synthetic approach of an extended series of but one<br/>natural interval to derive all the others.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Someone from one of these cultures might argue: &quot;How is it that<br/>&gt; someone has indoctrinated you so that you have not followed the<br/>&gt; natural course of using these beautiful melodic intervals</p><p>Margo errors in confusing that which is only perceived as being<br/>natural with what is objectively natural, i.e., those intervals which<br/>naturally occur within the lower regions of the harmonic series,<br/>intervals which are universal and not dependent upon cultural choice.<br/>For me, this is what JI is all about; it&apos;s not just anothe system, it<br/>is THE only natural system. I&apos;m not talking about various limited<br/>forms of JI, Pythgorean or the ubiquitous &quot;Just Scale&quot; of the<br/>acoustics theory books, though I admit that I did recommend that Robin<br/>use this particular structure to expand the essential JI concept to a<br/>selection of chords familiar to most teenagers.</p><p>&gt; We understand that each culture has developed in its own way, so that<br/>&gt; for people in each some just (as well as tempered!) intervals may seem<br/>&gt; familiar and &quot;natural,&quot; others strange or less inviting.</p><p>Again, I am not talking about what people THINK is natural, only that<br/>which is indeed natural according the laws of physic, according to<br/>those complex sounds produced by oscillating objects which manifest a<br/>harmonic series, which happens to be a majority of musical instruments<br/>world wide, including the human voice, bells and bars being the most<br/>obvious exceptions.</p><p>Pythagorean<br/>&gt; intonation, favored at various times and places, is simply a system<br/>&gt; for tuning in pure 3:2 fifths and 4:3 fourths. In Europe and also Near<br/>&gt; Eastern traditions influenced by the Greek tradition, this is<br/>&gt; associated with Pythagoras and his followers. In China or Japan, it<br/>&gt; has deep roots also.</p><p>No matter how ancient, I view any mathematical system which<br/>synthetically constructs a scale or a gamut by the extension of<br/>logical structures beyond the bounds of the lower (audibly<br/>perceivable) regions of the harmonic series as being after the fact,<br/>and in that sense, unnatural. I strongly suspect that ancient Chinese<br/>and Japanese intonation was like current day Mongolian intonation,<br/>until some wise guy came along and ran the numbers and imposed a<br/>Pythagorean cookie-cutter mentality upon it.</p><p> It&apos;s neither a great conspiracy nor a universal<br/>&gt; solution to all musical problems, just one kind of JI approach, and a<br/>&gt; very easy one to tune.</p><p>Only when you have the intellectual construct of deriving things by<br/>making chains of other things, AND when you have the practical<br/>construct of a musical instrument which allows you to realize the<br/>intellectual construct. In the absence of both, a pure major third is<br/>far more obvious and far easier to tune than a Pythag third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, getting back to the Near East, many intervals such as<br/>&gt; major or minor thirds are often played at or near Pythagorean sizes,<br/>&gt; because fretted instruments are often tuned in pure fifths and<br/>&gt; fourths.</p><p>My point exactly. Without such instruments, they&apos;d find it rather<br/>difficult. While we have no way of proving it, I find it preposterous<br/>to entertain the notion that any hunter/gather or early agrarian<br/>tribal group would hit upon something so unnatural as a Pythagorean<br/>major third. I think it is obvious that what &quot;ur altes&quot; peoples did<br/>was simply to open their mouths and make sounds which seemed pleasing<br/>in some way, and when this involved what we would call &quot;harmony&quot;, it<br/>would have been combinations based on readily perceivable overtone<br/>congruence, which is what we would call (extended) Just Intonation<br/>(though not in the sense of any rigid extended gamut derived by an<br/>extension of natural proportions). This is what the Mongolians do,<br/>what the Aborigines do, what Norwegian traditional musicians do, what<br/>lots of peoples do all over the planet, those who have been lucky<br/>enough to escape the curse of some Mesopotamian or Chinese or G(r)eek<br/>number cruncher coming along and telling them that what they are doing<br/>is wrong and they should stop listening and start adhering to some<br/>intellectual construct. They just pick up a bamboo tube and blow on<br/>it, or stretch a string and start plucking it, or grab an ox horn and<br/>blow on it, or pick up a tree branch hollowed out by termites and blow<br/>on it, and Lo! and Behold! - a scale emerges, which they imitate.<br/>Amazing! How is it possible without proceeding by a series of pure<br/>fifths until you have synthetically determined the precise placement<br/>of each tone? It just happens, that&apos;s how. And that is why I call<br/>Pythagorean &quot;unnatural&quot;. The only thing it is natural for is a fifth.<br/>One only. One could arge that a pure ninth is also Pythagorean, but<br/>the point is that you don&apos;t have to KNOW that it is the same thing as<br/>a stack of two pure fifths in order to hear it, nor do yo have to<br/>proceed by stacking fifths in order to produce it. If the tone is rich<br/>in harmonics, it jumps out and shouts, &quot;Hey! Listen to me!!&quot;</p><p>&gt; One thing I would urge: if a tuning system is taught, students should<br/>&gt; have an opportunity to hear some musical pieces, or at least examples<br/>&gt; of actual passages or progressions, where that system fits the music.</p><p>Agreed completely. Otherwise it&apos;s just a bunch of dead numbers.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div>
