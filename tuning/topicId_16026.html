Some earlier<br/>writers have even defined JI as the C mode of Ptolemy&apos;s Intense<br/>(syntonic) diatonic. Others admitted ratios of 7 and higher and there<br/>was an unspoken or unwritten assumption that JI should sound different<br/>from 12-tet.</p><p>It is only recently that theorists have tried to confuse the issue by<br/>deliberately inventing tuning systems which are aurally<br/>indistinguishable from 12-tet and calling them JI. Systems such as<br/>Hammond&apos;s gear ratios and Ellis&apos;s ratio  approximation to 12-tet have<br/>been considered  by most writers to be merely approximations of equal<br/>temperament and not true JI.  Since irrational intervals have to be<br/>approximated by rational fractions and because no physical system is<br/>either exactly in tune or completely stable, I think these quibbles are<br/>rather pointless. One can be clear enough by using a practical or<br/>effective definition -- JI is a tuning system whose intervals closely<br/>approximate ratios of small integers and which does not sound like an<br/>approximation to a tuning based on irrational frequency relationships.</p><p>Ivor Darreg faced similar definitional problems when he introduced the<br/>term xenharmonic. He was aware that one can write music in certain<br/>non-12-tet tuning systems which still sounds as if it were in 12-tet.<br/>Such music is NOT xenharmonic. Brian McLaren generated some musical<br/>examples (as midi files) and retuned them by computer while keeping all<br/>other musical parameters constant. In some cases, it was very difficult<br/>for most listeners to tell the tuning systems apart. In other cases,<br/>such as David Hills&apos;s examples, the distinction between meantone and<br/>12-tet was quite clear. The conclusion I draw from this is that one must<br/>take musical context as well as mathematics and psychophysics into<br/>account when describing tuning systems and their audible properties.</p><p>--John</p></div>
