It is most opportune that you should be joining us at<br/>this time, since otherwise we might have floundered about on this issue for<br/>some time with no clear direction or results. I&apos;m looking forward to further<br/>discussions and clarifications on that subject.</p><p>I&apos;d like to ask a question which you may attempt to answer as a member of<br/>academia:</p><p>&gt;At<br/>&gt;the time of our 1989 paper, Carey and I were unaware of MOS, Xenharmonicon<br/>&gt;not being in the holdings of the major research libraries we were<br/>&gt;inhabiting.</p><p>Why is it that all the major research libraries subscribe to 1/1 (the<br/>Journal of the Just Intonation Network) but virtually none subscribe to<br/>Xenharmonikon? (I have a personal interest in this question because I<br/>believe that my article in Xenharmonikon 17 addresses an issue common in the<br/>current journals, namely, generalizing diatonicity, but I fear that it will<br/>not get the attention that I believe it deserves from academia. Not to<br/>mention the attention that Wilson&apos;s many papers deserve.)</p></div>
