To my knowledge, they are not meant to be a full circle.  Do<br/>you disagree?  Remember, Werckmeister invented the circle in music regarding<br/>12 major and minor keys.  He doesn&apos;t focus on these 3 scales much at all.  Of<br/>course, anything you find out about them will be of the utmost interest.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=34719 href="#34719">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2002 3:04:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; In a message dated 2/22/02 4:35:50 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/>&gt; paul@s... writes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that&apos;s how Kirnberger III works: in &quot;8ve&quot;-equivalent terms,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; if C = n^0,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; aha! *that&apos;s* the key assumption you have to make. but isn&apos;t it<br/>just<br/>&gt; &gt; as valid to use G, or any other pitch as the &apos;center&apos;?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, it not musically valid to shift the starting pitch for a<br/>well<br/>&gt; tempered tuning.  Changing the starting note for a tuning<br/>completely<br/>&gt; disregards the composer&apos;s choice of intervals (as each key is<br/>different).</p><p>johnny, you&apos;re completely misinterpreting me. i&apos;m *not* talking about<br/>transposing werckmeister up a fifth, or anything like that. with what<br/>i&apos;m suggesting, the intervals between any pair of pitches would<br/>remain the same. all the pitches remain the same. the structure of<br/>the tuning, and the sound of the music, remains unchanged. it&apos;s just<br/>that monz is pinning the 1/1 ratio on c, and drawing far reaching<br/>conclusions from that, which i&apos;m arguing don&apos;t have much meaning.</p><p>&gt; Re Werckmeister IV, V, &amp; VI,  perhaps Paul, you can do some focus<br/>on these 3<br/>&gt; orphan scales.  To my knowledge, they are not meant to be a full<br/>circle.  Do<br/>&gt; you disagree?</p><p>from the data i presented, they sure seem to be full circles,<br/>*literally*. they do have a few very slightly *sharpened* fifths but<br/>this was common for example in french temperament ordinaire. please<br/>present alternative data if you have any. perhaps werckmeister said<br/>he intended them only for use in certain keys? please fill us in.</p><p>&gt; Remember, Werckmeister invented the circle in music regarding<br/>&gt; 12 major and minor keys.
