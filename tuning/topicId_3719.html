This one is the<br/>&gt;major third above F.  Two major tones (which is what four perfect fifths<br/>&gt;generate) is different.</p><p>The above is the usual standard JI scale plus two extra black notes.<br/>The standard has only one A.  Of course the other A is also desirable<br/>but not absolutely essential.  The same applies to a second D etc.</p><p>The origin of this scale can be seen in my post TD 202.15 which I won&apos;t<br/>quote here as it is too long.  The essence of that post is that is shows<br/>a complete pattern of development from unity to the most complex scales.<br/>The pattern that I list above is the part from 48 to 96 (the beginning<br/>of that post).  By two octaves later (192 to 384) the numbers 320 and<br/>324 (i.e 4 times 80 and 81) are roughly equal as Ken says, but in the 48<br/>to 96 octave 81 is very weak (unimportant) by comparison to 80 (I am<br/>taking liberties with powers of 2 here).</p><p>I would say that this scale has the maximum possible 7 limit<br/>relationships for the number of notes but very limited ability for<br/>modulation to nearby keys.  If some section is selected from further up<br/>the harmonic series in TD 202.15 then greater modulation capability<br/>exists but a larger number of notes are also required.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
