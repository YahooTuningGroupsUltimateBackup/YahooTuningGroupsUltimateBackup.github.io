No other pitch is allowed. I used Paul Stretch&apos;s filtering and compression to accomplish this BUT the piece was not stretched - this is what is the result of listening to just this one harmonic series from last week&apos;s ImprovFriday video 19 Black Hawks for Osama. The footage in the video was taken last winter and processed. So the result is a  harmonic spectral-ism drone on E.</p><p>Full quality video is here:<a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/harmonic_series/16E_ImprovFridays.wmv">http://micro.soonlabel.com/harmonic_series/16E_ImprovFridays.wmv</a></p><p>See the link below for audio only.</p><p><a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/harmonic_series/16E_ImprovFriday.mp3">http://micro.soonlabel.com/harmonic_series/16E_ImprovFriday.mp3</a></p></div>
