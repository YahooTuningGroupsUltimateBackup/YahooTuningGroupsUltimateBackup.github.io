But that is not what thunking is<br/>about at all. Thunking is about a reality check.</p><p>For those who are interested in what I actually said, I<br/>put what I said in the original emails over in the<br/>metatuning group for anyone who wants to know what it&apos;s<br/>all about.</p><p>I myself find the entire idea of voting off the weakest<br/>link or whatever to be fraught with errors, fallacies, and<br/>lies and never advocate such a thing. Look what happened<br/>in China and the Soviet Union earlier this century as an<br/>example. Yes those who perceive themselves as strong _can_<br/>dominate and destroy those they perceive as weak. That is<br/>what Mao Tse Tung did -- killed all the intellectuals and<br/>teachers and artists and religious leaders. And took China<br/>from being a marvelous center of culture and ideas to a<br/>third world country that can only steal ideas from others<br/>and produce cheap junk with slave labor in a single<br/>generation. Not to single China out here either, we got<br/>plenty of people like this here in the US as well (I am<br/>thinking of Thomas Edison as one of the more notorious<br/>examples.) And sure they can keep dominating and stealing<br/>but after you&apos;ve killed everyone who is &apos;a threat&apos; because<br/>they are actually -doing- something with their lives, then<br/>what?</p><p>But I like the idea of tribal rules in the spirit of fun,<br/>though as you&apos;ll see in my post I gave up on the idea of<br/>any mandatory rules.</p><p>I think rules are helpful only to the extent that they are<br/>voluntarily accepted as a tool to get our own acts<br/>together (and by that I mean me), whether the rule domain<br/>be life, art, composition, engineering, whatever.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=23331 href="#23331">ðŸ”—</a>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@orphonsoul.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2001 1:00:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 5/20/01 12:46 PM, &quot;X.
