Modern physics strongly points toward the<br/>possibility that the physical body along with all physical phenomena<br/>are a set of holographic-like metaphenomena generated from a<br/>common &quot;unified field&quot; (uniting magnetic, electromagnetic,<br/>gravitational, and the strong and weak nuclear forces) which is<br/>itself not differentiable from awareness.</p><p>****Sarn says: I have heard newer theorys of the Universe being of that of<br/>matter, enegry, dark matter and dark enegry, and also that of INFORMATION,<br/>and every constituant particle of the Universe4 COULD have a NUMERICAL IDENTITY.</p><p>Science takes a reductionalist approach, and it seems to me that it knows<br/>more-and-more about less-and-less.</p><p>A&lt;SNIP&gt;...a philosopher scientist was once discussing this in the presence of a<br/>group of world-class scientists and kept mentioning the intelligence<br/>implicit in the unified field from which all natural laws and<br/>associated phenomena are generated via a process of &quot;sequential<br/>symmetry breaking&quot; (from unified field theory). A prominent<br/>physicist, hiself a unfied field theorist, asked him why he kept<br/>referring to the unified field as intelligent.</p><p>Sarn says: A Universe as a mind????? Yes?!<br/>&lt;<br/>SNIP&gt;The philosopher asked the physicist whether he thought himself to be<br/>intelligent. The physicist answered that he did. The philosopher then<br/>asked him if he thought he existed outside the unified field (from<br/>which all matter and energy theoretically arises). The physicist saw<br/>the point clearly and responded with a facial expression that clearly<br/>indicated an &quot;aha&quot; experience.</p><p>Sarn says:Which I am doing, but cannot show on ASCII or pen and paper.</p><p>&lt;SNIP&gt;So consider the possiblity that every organism contains within it an<br/>anolog, a practical implementation, of every natural law that has<br/>participated in its evolution to that point. Eventually, there should<br/>arise an organism that contains within it the complete set of natural<br/>laws operating in nature. This organism would be capable of<br/>reflecting locally the nature of the whole from which it originated.</p><p>Sarn says:An intelligent Universe??!? Yes!??!</p><p>&lt;SNIP&gt;It could consciously reflect on the nature of its own origin. It<br/>could mirror the workings of nature in its own localized intelligence<br/>and project them into objects that implemented those laws. It could<br/>write scriptures describing itself as made in the image of its Source.</p><p>It could also stupidly deny its connection with the intelligence that<br/>fostered its evolution. It could arrogantly consider itself, in spite<br/>of its status as an infinitessimally small subcomponent of the cosmic<br/>system that evolved it, as superior to everything else in the<br/>universe from which it sprouted, and with this fragmented thinking<br/>which destroys the integrity of the wholeness of our cosmos, create<br/>technologies which it misapplies to destroy the very system that<br/>sustains it.</p><p>Sarn says:Yes, but this NEEDN&apos;T be so...</p><p>I can see a positive future, as long as there are intelligent people around.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p></div>
