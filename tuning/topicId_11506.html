I am only hasty in that what i can directly observe might take 100 years to get<br/>around to prove or even ask the right question.  the missing fundamental can easily be<br/>explained via difference tones. We have be able to guess before hand sequences based on guide<br/>tones without any problem at all. Wilson enjoys playing such sequences on an ORGAN to<br/>illustrate that the ear can hear and process them. just as I have enjoyed playing nice big<br/>sustained subharmonic chords on ORGANS as well as wood and metal. I am sorry your own<br/>experience with this material is limited to the electronic medium.<br/>[Paul Erlich, TD 738.6]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know George Kahrimanis will disagree with me, but I believe<br/>&gt; that chords which are expressed most simply as subharmonic series<br/>&gt; are only consonant insofar as the individual intervals are<br/>&gt; consonant, and there is no perception of unity through an<br/>&gt; octave-shifted common overtone or a Partchian &quot;Numerary Nexus&quot;<br/>&gt; or any such phenomenon. What is well-established in<br/>&gt; psychoacoustical science, however, is our nervous system&apos;s<br/>&gt; ability to process and simplify the sensation of chords<br/>&gt; which are expressed most simply as harmonic series -- the brain<br/>&gt; is able to supply a missing fundamental (we know it is the brain<br/>&gt; at work since the harmonics can be separated dichoically), and<br/>&gt; nonlinear combination tones will only reinforce whatever harmonic<br/>&gt; series is already implied.</p><p>&quot;Paul H. Erlich&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Banaphshu wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;To my ear, these are extremely consonant chords, much more than your<br/>&gt; western practice numerals would make you think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would say that 7:9:11 and similar chords have some degree of<br/>&gt; _concordance_, and very much like styles of music (e.g., Partch) that<br/>&gt; incorporate them; however, I would say that they would not be accepted where<br/>&gt; augmented triads are written in a score of Gesualdo, Gluck, or Grieg.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;. I also don&apos;t understand your &quot;research&quot; concerning the subharmonic chords<br/>&gt; for I have always heard them as consonant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK . . . I hear them as consonant too, but only to the extent that the<br/>&gt; individual intervals are consonant . . . have you tried the examples that<br/>&gt; Daniel Wolf posted comparing the 4:5:6:7:9 and 1/9:1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 chords?<br/>&gt; These chords contain exactly the same intervals, but with a timbre rich<br/>&gt; enough in harmonic partials, say a sustained trumpet sound, the subharmonic<br/>&gt; chord sounds more discordant (in my opinion, because of that &quot;car horn&quot; 7:9)<br/>&gt; than the harmonic chord -- in fact Joseph perceived the subharmonic chord<br/>&gt; followed by the harmonic chord as a powerful resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suspect we may be basing our judgments on vastly different timbres -- in<br/>&gt; your case, metallophones or their wooden cousins perhaps?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;harmonically based chords many times just blend into a timbre.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly. With metallophones and other types of instruments that are<br/>&gt; primarily a sine wave with weak, possibly inharmonic, overtones, and maybe<br/>&gt; some noise, a justly tuned otonal chord will blend into the sensation of a<br/>&gt; single note, even if the fundamental of that note is physically absent. With<br/>&gt; more complex timbres playing a &quot;harmonically based&quot; (otonal) chord, this<br/>&gt; fundamental sensation will be very strong and provide a sense of order that<br/>&gt; overwhelms the dissonance arising from any individual intervals. Play the<br/>&gt; mirror-image of that chord (the &quot;subharmonic&quot; or utonal version), and any<br/>&gt; dissonant intervals will noticeably spoil the consonance of the chord as a<br/>&gt; whole.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The problem must be with my ears as it is hard to imagine that science<br/>&gt; could be mistaken.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I make references to &quot;science&quot; where I seek explanations for what I hear but<br/>&gt; what I hear always comes first. My opinions on this matter are based on<br/>&gt; extensive listening first, and then trying to understand what I hear in<br/>&gt; terms of what is understood about the ear and brain -- never the other way<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=11507 href="#11507">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2000 11:20:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Banaphshu wrote: (a correction or two)</p><p>&gt;  We have been able to guess before hand sequences based on guide tones<br/>&gt; without any problem at all.
