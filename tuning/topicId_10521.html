The &quot;former&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; function of<br/>&gt; any interesting intervals in these scales is _totally irrelevant_ because<br/>&gt; the mapping to the traditional keyboard, and the fact that the traditional<br/>&gt; keyboard is used at all, is _purely arbitrary_. These characteristics you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; been focusing on are completely incidental, and could easily disappear in a<br/>&gt; keyboard mapping philosophy different from &quot;one key, one pitch&quot;</p><p>I suppose Paul, you are right in that after about 12+ years squeezing<br/>out a living as a &quot;professional pianist&quot; I would develop a keyboard<br/>fixation!</p><p>HOWEVER, I&apos;m not totally convinced I don&apos;t have a point in comparing<br/>these &quot;new&quot; scales to the traditional keyboard.  After all, our standard<br/>associations with the keyboard goes back a long way.  I remember being a<br/>little startled seeing a 500 year old standard 2+3 keyboard at the<br/>Metropolitan Museum...  This goes back a ways, of course...</p><p>Is comparing our &quot;standard&quot; practices as musicians... the &quot;standard&quot;<br/>12t-ET keyboard with xenharmonic scales really all that reprehensible??<br/>I realize it doesn&apos;t FEATURE the entire spectrum of sound with the<br/>freedom maybe desired through the eyes of a theoretical physicist...</p><p>I suppose I might feel the same way about the 5-line staff.  This stuff<br/>is just so &quot;ingrained&quot; that I, personally, see nothing wrong with<br/>comparing the &quot;xenharmonic&quot; against it.</p><p>But, I will keep an open mind until I am convinced.</p><p>Speaking of MAPPING, I do have a few questions concerning the Erlich<br/>22-note scales and others.  I believe I understand the procedure in<br/>Scala for mapping scales to the keyboard.  It looks pretty much like<br/>it&apos;s a simple text file that you load in...</p><p>However, in the Erlich 22-note scales in Scala, there is only ONE, I<br/>believe #5 that contains 22 notes that a person COULD map to a keyboard.<br/>The others are all decatonic -- 10.  How could you map that to a<br/>keyboard except one note at a time ascending.  I DID read your paper,<br/>but I&apos;m not understanding how it is done... except that you say<br/>something about starting another set at the pitch &quot;E,&quot; or something of<br/>that nature.  I&apos;m mystified at this.</p><p>Oh yes, and the 1,4,7,9 in the decatonic certainly show the difference<br/>between major and minor.  They really do make beautiful chords.</p><p>And I WAS comparing the &quot;quasi jazz&quot; chords that I made when I just<br/>played familiar &quot;keyboard patterns&quot; with the new scales...  But is that,<br/>as I say again, so totally IRREVELANT... when it is the product of such<br/>ingrained musicianship??...</p><p>I always enjoy agreeing with you when I am convinced... but on this one<br/>I still feel I have a case and am not yet totally convinced.</p><p>Does anyone else have an opinion on this topic?... or is it really so<br/>irrelevant??  I would like to hear specifically from the &quot;ingrained<br/>ivory&quot; set...</p><p>__________ _____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
