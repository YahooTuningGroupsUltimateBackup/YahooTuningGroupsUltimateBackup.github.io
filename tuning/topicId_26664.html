I red<br/>he used some unusual intervals, and he is one of my favourite composers, so<br/>I decided to buy the score. Indeed, the first mouvement Hora lunga (1994) is<br/>a monody, to be played entirely on the low C-string of the viola. Ligeti<br/>makes use of the natural intervals (pure major third,  pure minor seventh<br/>and also the 11th harmonic). The harmonics of C serve as a model. Nothing<br/>spectacular in itself, if it wasn&apos;t that Ligeti is a leading composer and<br/>it&apos;s conforting to notice that, whenever folkmelodies (in this case<br/>Romanian) are referred to, Just Intonation seems to be approved as a better<br/>tool for this musical language.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard, perhaps this is an idea for Anastasia, since she&apos;s already<br/>collaborating in your coming AFMM Festival. Congratulations, by the way!</p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
