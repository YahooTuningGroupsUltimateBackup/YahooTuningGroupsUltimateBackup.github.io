This means that his<br/>approach so far is to find well-temperaments that deviate from 12-tet<br/>by 6-7 cents max. While this may not personally satisfy those of us on<br/>the bleeding edge who are exploring higher-limit systems like Orwell<br/>and Miracle, or radically different 5-limit tunings like Porcupine and<br/>Mavila, or generally want something -far away- from 12-equal, there&apos;s<br/>a certain market for what he wants to accomplish and I wish him the<br/>best of luck in his endeavor. I&apos;ve encouraged him to work with<br/>completely different tonal systems but for now this is where his<br/>efforts are focused.</p><p>His earlier systems basically involved messing with things like<br/>diminished[12] that are tuned slightly off from 12-equal. I think he<br/>messed with some sort of augmented[12] variants as well. I&apos;m not sure<br/>what the latest incarnation of his Piagui scale is. (To Mario: I would<br/>highly recommend, by the way, looking at the 12-note MOS scale for<br/>diaschismatic temperament, as you might find some pretty huge<br/>intonational improvements there.)</p><p>I believe all of his scales come out of looking at a 612 note MOS that<br/>he constructs by treating the generators as the schisma and one other<br/>comma, and then he finds useful 12-note subsets of that. So it looks<br/>like what he&apos;s done this time is ditch the octave and just stack the<br/>two generating intervals on top of one another, much like Petr&apos;s doing<br/>with his rank-2 subgroup approach for otherwise rank-3 temperaments.<br/>Apparently when you do this, you arrive at an octave that is<br/>pleasantly slightly sharp, which will vibe well both with the natural<br/>inharmonic stretch of the piano timbre, as well as the natural<br/>preference that people have for slightly sharp octaves.</p><p>So when Mario is saying he&apos;s found the &quot;true octave,&quot; what he&apos;s really<br/>saying is that, above.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>PS to other regular mapping theorists - If we do the above as much as<br/>possible, sooner or later we&apos;ll take over the world!</p></div><h3>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2011 8:17:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Alright, since Mario&apos;s post seems to be throwing everyone for a loop,<br/>&gt; allow me to explain where he&apos;s coming from in stricter theoretical<br/>&gt; terms.</p><p>Thanks, Mike.

If it were extended further, however, the actual tuning of the<br/>instrument would become increasingly inaccurate. This is due to a factor<br/>known as inharmonicity &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inharmonicity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inharmonicity</a>&gt;, which<br/>is present in different amounts in all piano strings.

This is due to a factor known as inharmonicity, which is present in different amounts in all piano strings. Strings&apos; harmonic series do not fall exactly into whole-number multiples of their fundamental frequency; instead each harmonic runs slightly sharp, the sharpness increasing as higher tones in the harmonic series are reached. This problem is mitigated by &quot;stretching&quot; the octaves as one tunes above (and to an extent below) the temperament region. When octaves are stretched, they are tuned, not to the lowest coincidental overtone (second partial) of the note below, but to a higher one (often the 4th partial).

Since some members of the list want to have it as soon as possible, I decided to postpone the paper and send to Mike Battaglia, via tuning yahoogroups the following:</p><p>-- The true octave (given in decimals, 11 decimal digits and cents)</p><p>-- A 12 tone scale (the piano middle true octave) that I named MPER12ET given by 11 decimal digits (C = 1, 2C = The adjusted cents to work with A = 440 Hz),</p><p>-- The 12 tone scale where 2C equals the true octave value given in decimals and cents.</p><p>-- 12 Equal fifths (decimals and cents)</p><p>-- 12 Equal major fifths (decimals and cents)</p><p>-- A brief summary of the procedure used to derive the true octave.</p><p>All the above can be sent in a message. Since I cannot send attachments to tuning, I can also send you an attached table containing the 88 piano keyboard frequencies given in decimals, cents, Hz, A = 440,  to the email address stated by tuning.</p><p>I am waiting for your instructions to achieve the above.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario<br/>Lima, July 13, 2011</p></div><h3>Mario Pizarro &#x3C;piagui@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2011 8:22:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris,</p><p>Thank you for your words, the fever is gone.

In the past century, a well known orchestra director and mathematician, Juli&iuml;&iquest;&half;n Carrillo from M&iuml;&iquest;&half;xico, anounced that he detected by ear that the exact octave is sligtly higher than 2. He wrote a book titled SONIDO 13, and couldn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t derive its exact value. You&iuml;&iquest;&half;d better believe me. The finded octave is fantastic.</p><p>I am absolutely shure that any scale that is based on the true octave will produce full armonized chords.</p><p>Seems that you are not an open minded man. You should study the DERIVING THE TRUE OCTAVE file.</p><p>The octave is a natural parameter that man forced to be a round number. Until now, I think, didn&iuml;&iquest;&half;t find a natural property whose value is a round figure, the 2 octave is a forced parameter.</p><p>You can send me your personal email address in order to send you attached, the corrected page # 1.

In the past, somebody stated the 2 octave, this wrong value is responsible of the many incongruences and imperfections we find in the music harmony.

It was done in two contiguous<br/>    afternoons using a second piano tuned to 12 tet for comparison purposes and<br/>    I was a witness of how rigurous was the pianist. At the end of the<br/>    evaluation he informed that in all comparisons the true octave chords and<br/>    chord progressions were much much better than 12 tet. I just phoned the<br/>    pianist to tell him that one member of tuning (Steve Parker) wrote that the<br/>    true octave scale sounds bad, he said that probably he (Steve) is invaded by<br/>    2 octave chords and that if he practice the true octave scale his opinion<br/>    might be different.</p><p>    He recommended me to tune just the following: C maj: (100.49 + 401.95 +<br/>    703.4 cents), C minor: (301.46 instead of 401.95) and separately: 1005.37<br/>    and 1004.89 for major and minor sevenths so this way by tuning only 6 piano<br/>    keys we can do about a 70 % of the evaluation.</p><p>    Mario<br/>    July, 25</p><p>    ----- Original Message -----<br/>    From: &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@...&gt;<br/>    To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>    Sent: Monday, July 25, 2011 3:55 AM<br/>    Subject: [tuning] Re: The true octave</p><p>    &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mario&quot; &lt;piagui@...&gt; wrote:<br/>    &gt;&gt; ...
