Back to the old days - with computers so fast, you seldom<br/>need to do that anymore, except for a real number crunching maths<br/>search.</p><p>However, I&apos;ve managed to get it down to an estimated 1.5 to 2 hours for<br/>the 21000 posts now.</p><p>Needs about another hour or so (not timed yet) to go through all the<br/>posts and ftp all the links mentioned to make a list of links mentioned<br/>with titles (new feature).</p><p>It is spending more time making the posts into html and the<br/>making all the html tables than it does actually<br/>reading the text files from disk, and saving the html files,<br/>but they are within the same order of magnitude at least.</p><p>Most of the time now is that needed to ftp the archive in the first<br/>place, at least on a 56 K modem (though having done that, I don&apos;t need<br/>to do it again).</p><p>May upload a preliminary version of it soon.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
