Both necks cost me around $500 or so each, and the<br/>guitars that they were grafted onto were both about $700 new,<br/>so...make me an offer?</p><p>I also have a 17-EDO acoustic guitar that was made custom for me by<br/>Lukas Brunner in Switzerland.  It is a deep resonant instrument meant<br/>to be tuned low and played loud, and I spent a pretty penny on it--a<br/>cool $4000.  To get $3000 for it would be sweet, but I&apos;ll entertain<br/>other offers.</p><p>I&apos;m going to cross-post this to MMM just in case, please e-mail me<br/>off-list if you&apos;re interested.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=78621 href="#78621">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2008 12:44:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dzam, Igs.  Good luck selling them.  But I&apos;d rather you<br/>were asking for donations towards your next album using<br/>them.  Anyway, I think you&apos;re among the finest musicians<br/>ever to take up our sublime cause, and if you ever have a<br/>change of heart I&apos;ll be there to buy your albums.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
