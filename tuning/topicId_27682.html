While going through an old email folder I ran across a<br/>&gt; couple of old digests.

Is that correct, Robert.</p><p>&gt; Is the problem still space??  Maybe we could take up a &quot;collection...&quot;</p><p>I expect we&apos;ve got most of them, maybe all.</p><p>However, duplicates are fine, as the program sorts them<br/>all by date and removes duplicates.</p><p>Why not just send the 1606 anyway John, and I can see how they fit<br/>in.</p><p>Is the ONelist one the same as the one at yahoogroups, renamed? if so<br/>I hve those already - the earlier posts in the on-line<br/>archive.<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tuning/arch./index.html">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tuning/arch./index.html</a></p><p>I&apos;ve not done much on the archives program for a while.<br/>I made a first draft of the mills archive, but it has a fair number of<br/>bugs in it - sorting of the messages by date can be improved, and some<br/>small things. I&apos;ll  do a proper version of it when I get back to work<br/>on the program.</p><p>The date thing is a bit tricky as the messages have various dates<br/>depending on time zone. Also same message has differing send date / time shown<br/>depending who receives it, for some reason. Effect is, one<br/>can get replies to messages before the posts that they are a reply<br/>to. I had ideas of ways of dealing with this (by using the<br/>ordering of the messages in the digest), but don&apos;t seem to<br/>have coded them up yet.</p><p>Should be okay to upload it to tripod - they have a<br/>generous Mb allowance, and will accept zips and<br/>html pages. I&apos;m using them for the FTS beta<br/>download page. Would do the archive in a separate<br/>web site.</p><p>May be useful to have an alternative<br/>site for the zip, if anyone has problems downloading<br/>the zip from tripod. I think they have some kind of precaution<br/>against what they call remote loading - hosting a file<br/>at tripod that is linked to from another site.</p><p>I use my ntlworld account for alternate download page<br/>for FTS, but have very little space there, perhaps just<br/>enough for all my programs, if I delete everything else<br/>there.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>8/31/2001 6:23:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27729">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/27729</a></p><p>&gt; Hi JOhn, and Joseph,</p><p>Hi Robert...</p><p>It&apos;s great to know that you are still working on the &quot;combined&quot;<br/>archive...
