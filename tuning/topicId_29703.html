Likewise the next one transposed<br/>up a keyboard whole tone is also labeled &quot;dissonant...&quot;</p><p>And, going in the other direction *below* the F#3 C#4 F#4 B4 the<br/>pattern is, apparently, also broken since:</p><p>E3 B3 E4 A4                 G&gt; C&lt; D&gt; F               dissonant</p><p>is also labeled &quot;dissonant.&quot;</p><p>So the pattern of just tetrads breaks off on that end, too.</p><p>Now, why is it that the pattern breaks and just tetrads don&apos;t run for<br/>the remaining length of the keyboard?</p><p>I notice similar changes in the extremities... only they do different<br/>things, in the other chord lists.</p><p>There has to be an easy explanation for this... I can sense it...</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>________ ________ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>10/29/2001 7:31:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:9rijbl+jlah@eGroups.com">9rijbl+jlah@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Joseph, Blackjack isn&apos;t an equal temperament!

(let&apos;s say C, for instance) and that&apos;s the only place where<br/>they don&apos;t alternate.</p><p>My guess is that&apos;s what &quot;throws it off&quot; when the transpositions<br/>extend over one &quot;octave...&quot;</p><p>Am I on the right track, Paul??</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>10/29/2001 11:04:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; However, I was puzzled that when I transposed by a &quot;secor&quot; of 116<br/>&gt; cents (a &quot;whole tone&quot; on the keyboard) the 4:5:6:7 tetrads were<br/>&gt; maintained for EIGHT transpositions and then suddenly stopped.</p><p>It&apos;s the same phenonmenon as trasposing by fifths in a meantone<br/>system, and suddenly hitting the wolf. In a meantone system, you have<br/>a pattern of 0,1,4 for triads--one fifth up gives the fifth, and four<br/>fifths gives the third.

Starting<br/>from the third, this means 0 secors for the third, 5 for the 7/4, 7<br/>for the octave, and 13 for the fifth. You can go from 0,5,7,13 all<br/>the way to 7,12,14,20 with no problem, but 8,13,15,21 means you&apos;ve<br/>hit the wolf secor, and have a wolf fifth.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2001 11:32:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Now, why is it that the pattern breaks and just tetrads don&apos;t run<br/>for<br/>&gt; the remaining length of the keyboard?</p><p>Because the scale is only a chain of 20 secors, reduced to within one<br/>octave.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit like the case of the &quot;wolf&quot; in a 12-tone meantone, which<br/>is a chain of 11 fifths, reduced to within one octave:</p><p>Bb D  F     4:5:6<br/>B  Eb F#    dissonant<br/>C  E  G     4:5:6<br/>C# F  G#    dissonant<br/>D  F# A     4:5:6<br/>Eb G  Bb    4:5:6<br/>E  G# B     4:5:6<br/>F  A  C     4:5:6<br/>F# Bb C#    dissonant<br/>G  B  D     4:5:6<br/>G# C  Eb    dissonant<br/>A  C# E     4:5:6</p><p>More specifically, in the blackjack case, the pattern you noticed<br/>would hold indefinitely up and down the keyboard if you used a non-<br/>octave-repeating version of the blackjack scale:</p><p> . . . . 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 . . . .</p><p>But since, once an octave, you have two consecutive &quot;2&quot;s, the pattern<br/>is broken -- usually resulting in a dissonant chord, but sometimes in<br/>a new type of consonant chord.</p><p>And don&apos;t forget to consider all the inversions of the chords I&apos;ve<br/>listed for you!</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>10/29/2001 7:06:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/29718">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/29718</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, I was puzzled that when I transposed by a &quot;secor&quot; of 116<br/>&gt; &gt; cents (a &quot;whole tone&quot; on the keyboard) the 4:5:6:7 tetrads were<br/>&gt; &gt; maintained for EIGHT transpositions and then suddenly stopped.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s the same phenonmenon as trasposing by fifths in a meantone<br/>&gt; system, and suddenly hitting the wolf.
