So I&apos;m wondering why Duffin doesn&apos;t consider any ways to<br/>sing other than strict JI, or strict adherence to a temperament.</p><p>His remarks on vibrato are unclear. At first he seems to be saying<br/>vibrato can help to &apos;cover up&apos; for the impure intervals of his<br/>proposed JI versions:</p><p>&quot;a pitch variance of 22 cents is negligible for vibrato anyway.<br/>Moreover, using vibrato to cover up imperfections in tuning is<br/>something that happens all the time in performances today, even where<br/>the goal is Equal Temperament.&quot;</p><p>Not a statement that fills me with hope for performances of<br/>Renaissance music.</p><p>But then at the end he enthuses over the Hilliards&apos; largely<br/>vibrato-free Tallis. See the footnote:</p><p>&quot;Seashore and Barbour maintain that scooping and pitch wandering make<br/>it impossible for singers to come reliably closer to a certain<br/>frequency than about a fifth of a semitone. (...) But the Hilliard<br/>Ensemble recording excerpt given below, in a sampling of major chords<br/>at eleven points throughout, gives an average major 10th (the most<br/>common voicing for the third) with a ratio of 2.507 above the root.<br/>This compares with the pure ratio of 2.500 and the ET ratio of 2.520,<br/>and represents a predilection for thirds that are twice as close to<br/>pure as they are to ET, as well as a tuning accuracy six times closer<br/>to the intended frequency than that predicted above.&quot;</p><p>A bit of a contradiction... unless Duffin is thinking that one should<br/>use comma-wide vibrato only at points which are &apos;difficult&apos; in JI,<br/>which would hardly be practical or artistic. (The Tallis does not<br/>include any &apos;difficult&apos; spots.)</p><p>Unfortunately I can&apos;t get his examples to play in my browser, so my<br/>critique will have to remain verbal for the time being.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Wild &lt;wild@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear tuners,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some of you might be interested in this article by Ross Duffin that has<br/>&gt; just come out in Music Theory Online:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://mto.societymusictheory.org/issues/mto.06.12.3/mto.06.12.3.duffin.html">http://mto.societymusictheory.org/issues/mto.06.12.3/mto.06.12.3.duffin.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s called &quot;Just Intonation in Renaissance Theory and Practice&quot; and it<br/>&gt; demonstrates some synthesised sound clips demonstrating the author&apos;s<br/>&gt; suggestions for getting around problems of comma drift.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best - Jon Wild<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=67844 href="#67844">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@calweb.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2006 1:39:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, 29 Oct 2006, Jon Wild wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear tuners,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some of you might be interested in this article by Ross Duffin that has<br/>&gt; just come out in Music Theory Online:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://mto.societymusictheory.org/issues/mto.06.12.3/mto.06.12.3.duffin.html">http://mto.societymusictheory.org/issues/mto.06.12.3/mto.06.12.3.duffin.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s called &quot;Just Intonation in Renaissance Theory and Practice&quot; and it<br/>&gt; demonstrates some synthesised sound clips demonstrating the author&apos;s<br/>&gt; suggestions for getting around problems of comma drift.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best - Jon Wild<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hello, Jon, and thank you for calling this article to my attention.</p><p>My own reaction is a bit like that I saw on the Tuning List: what about<br/>adaptive JI a la Vicentino? This is not to say that singers would<br/>necessarily follow any precise mathematical model (something that Vincenzo<br/>Galilei says explicitly, and that Zarlino may be implying when he says<br/>that singers tend toward pure vertical concords, but do not encounter<br/>the kinds of difficulties found on keyboards tuned in the syntonic<br/>diatonic).</p><p>A small technical correction, or rather quibble: the schisma by which<br/>a Pythagorean diminished fourth at 8192:6561 differs from a pure 5:4<br/>major third, 32805:32768, is minutely smaller than the amount by which<br/>a fifth is tempered in 12n-EDO, or 1/12 Pythagorean comma. Some years<br/>ago this minute difference between a 700-cent fifth and one at the<br/>just ratio of 16384:10935 was playfully referred to on the Tuning List<br/>as the &quot;Scintilla of Artusi,&quot; because of Artusi&apos;s criticism of Monteverdi,<br/>as discussed by Mark Lindley, for writing vocal music in a style which,<br/>to Artusi, suggested the influence of equal temperament on the lute.<br/>(Actually Wert, applauded by Artusi, had likewise used the diminished<br/>fourth in vocal music -- but that&apos;s another discussion.) Anyway, Artusi&apos;s<br/>conclusion was that 12-note equal temperament was fine on fretted<br/>instruments, but not should be adopted for voices until it could be<br/>described in terms of known integer ratios! Kirnberger relied on the<br/>near-identity of the schisma and 1/12-Pythagorean comma for a proposal<br/>of 1766 on how keyboards could be placed in virtual 12-EDO by just<br/>intonation techniques -- if one could actually tune pure intervals so<br/>precisely by ear in long chains, as Owen Jorgensen adds! Thus the<br/>&quot;scintilla of Artusi&quot; was a humorous reference to Artusi&apos;s desire<br/>for 12-EDO by known integer ratios, and Kirnberger&apos;s approximate<br/>solution.</p><p>Getting back to Renaissance just intonation, I would say that fractional<br/>comma shifts could possibly help resolve the puzzle of understanding not<br/>only Zarlino&apos;s remark that singers are untroubled by comma problems, but<br/>also Galilei&apos;s remarks finding the same (and suggesting that singers<br/>seem to approximate a kind of meantone temperament somewhere between<br/>12-EDO and the 2/7-comma both he and Galilei favor for keyboards<br/>(in Galilei&apos;s case, despite his theoretical preference for 12-EDO as<br/>a perfect or &quot;spherical&quot; music).</p><p>Maybe empirical studies of what good Renaissance ensembles do is one<br/>approach, albeit to demonstrate what is possible rather than necessarily<br/>what happened in the 16th century.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s model offered by his second archicembalo or arciorgano<br/>tuning, in principal with two 19-note keyboards (Gb-B#) in something<br/>like 1/4-comma or 31-EDO at 1/4-comma apart if this appealing<br/>interpretation is correct, seems still a useful one at least to<br/>experiment with. (In practice, he could not fit E# and B# on his<br/>upper keyboard, thus leaving him with a 36-note instrument.)</p><p>For people curious to hear what this sounds like in a crude MIDI<br/>rendition, here are some examples:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/LassoPrologue.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.ogg">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.ogg</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.mid">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/GesualdoGagliardaAJI.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>A possible caution is that while the article eloquently advocates<br/>a 5-limit (or &quot;6-limit,&quot; following Zarlino&apos;s senario) aesthetic<br/>for Renaissance music, applying this aesthetic to &quot;late medieval&quot;<br/>music is a more complicated proposition. If we have in mind the<br/>later Dufay, say, such a proposal is not unlikely. However, for<br/>the 14th century -- to me still &quot;late medieval,&quot; if we conceive<br/>of medieval in music as roughly 500-1420 or a bit later -- a<br/>Pythagorea or even Marchettan aesthetic might be more applicable<br/>to certain styles. The latter term refers to the vocal intonation<br/>described by Marchettus of Padua (1318) in his Lucidarium, where<br/>major thirds and sixths resolving in directed progressions are<br/>made rather larger than Pythagorean, and cadential semitones or<br/>dieses rather smaller. For a more &quot;extremophile&quot; interpretation,<br/>with major thirds and sixths around 450 and 950 cents, this<br/>brief example may give some idea:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/PythEnharImprov01.mp3">http://www.bestii.com/~mschulter/PythEnharImprov01.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>The point here is that an appreciation for Renaissance JI can be<br/>one instructive instance of sensitivity to the stylistical<br/>implications of any era.</p><p>Another small point on the article: what Zarlino does in 1571<br/>is not to abandon his 2/7-comma meantone of 1558, but to note<br/>that 1/4-comma and also 1/3-comma are also available, with<br/>1/4-comma easy to tune and pleasing to the ear, and 1/3-comma<br/>somewhat &quot;languid&quot; in effect. What this may imply between the<br/>lines (as Mark Lindley has suggested) is that either 1/4-comma<br/>or 2/7-comma may be in the range of optimal meantone euphony<br/>(with Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone, for example, somewhere<br/>in between), but the former is easier to tune by ear.</p><p>One might wonder why adaptive JI has not received more<br/>attention in the literature on Renaissance JI, especially from<br/>advocates. Roger Wibberley did an article in MTO concluding<br/>that JI _was_ practical, taking Willaert&apos;s famous puzzle<br/>piece often interpreted as a demonstration of 12-EDO or the<br/>like as in fact a lesson in JI through remote Pythagorean<br/>accidentals (with schismatic thirds treated as equivalent<br/>to 5-limit).</p><p>He assumed, however, that vertical JI must imply the<br/>problem of the comma -- with the best practical solution<br/>for pitch stability, which he sees at play in some music<br/>of Willaert, requiring the composer carefully to note<br/>and keep track of comma shifts so that they balance out.<br/>However, I am tempted to question the conclusion which he<br/>draws, not so surprisingly, once the premise is granted:<br/>that most music of composers contemporary with Willaert,<br/>but who do not attend to balancing the comma shifts, was<br/>actually performed by vocalists in Pythagorean intonation!<br/>The hypothesis of adaptive JI seems more attractive, unless<br/>the style of a piece seems to fit a Pythagorean ethos --<br/>which might be more applicable to Ockeghem or even Josquin,<br/>in certain situations, than to music by the 1540&apos;s or so.<br/>This is not to rule out the possibility of a &quot;common<br/>practice&quot; based on some kind of adaptive JI, and a more<br/>&quot;select&quot; one based on the deliberate use of unequal<br/>whole-tones and commas in pieces where the composer<br/>balances shifts as proposed for Willaert by Wibberley.</p><p>If this article by Ross Duffin prompts more discussion --<br/>and it is very readable and engaging -- then our<br/>understanding both of Renaissance music and of the &quot;art<br/>of the possible&quot; for vocalists may be improved as we<br/>continue the exploration urged by the author.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=67847 href="#67847">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2006 1:29:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; A small technical correction, or rather quibble: the schisma by which<br/>&gt; a Pythagorean diminished fourth at 8192:6561 differs from a pure 5:4<br/>&gt; major third, 32805:32768, is minutely smaller than the amount by which<br/>&gt; a fifth is tempered in 12n-EDO, or 1/12 Pythagorean comma.

When Zarlino first describes 2/7-comma in 1558 he doesn&apos;t say where it comes from, but you would expect it must have been derived as a &quot;cross&quot; between 1/4-comma with its pure M3s and 1/3-comma with its pure m3s - especially given the emphasis Zarlino places on major and minor thirds in the rest of his treatise.</p><p>You mention &quot;the range of tunings in use then&quot;--if we&apos;re talking about 1558 then 2/7-comma is *all* we know about for sure--Zarlino&apos;s is the earliest surviving unambiguous meantone description. We know (from Ramis) that some kind of meantone was in use in the 1480s, but we don&apos;t know which one. The New Grove article on &quot;Regular meantone temperaments to 1600&quot; by Mark Lindley has lots of information - it mentions 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 1/5, 1/6, 2/9. It&apos;s a bit long to paste in the whole article, sorry. 3/14 and 5/18 seem to be the only other fractions that crop up in the follow-up article &quot;Regular mean-tone temperaments from 1600&quot; and in the &quot;mean tone&quot; article itself (which is very short).
