To compose each movement, I first constructed a<br/>hierarchical structure representing a melodic fragment, and then<br/>embedded that structure within itself.  The resulting movements might<br/>therefore be called weakly self-similar. (A truly self-similar<br/>movement would result only if this embedding process were carried out<br/>infinitely many times.)</p><p>So in each movement, listen for a single melodic fragment to be<br/>repeated at diatonic transpositions and tempi that outline a<br/>large-scale instance of the very same fragment.  Notice, too, how the<br/>perception of that repeated fragment evolves: at higher tempi it<br/>begins to resemble compound melody.  My favorite parts of the piece<br/>are the second and last movements, especially the ascent to the last<br/>movements climax beginning around 1:26, and the following final<br/>descent.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>  Carl McTague</p></div><h3><a id=56147 href="#56147">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2004 1:23:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I have put a new piece online called &quot;The Lyre of Ur&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://www.mctague.org/carl/music/computer/pieces/lyre">http://www.mctague.org/carl/music/computer/pieces/lyre</a></p><p>I particularly like &quot;lament&quot;.
