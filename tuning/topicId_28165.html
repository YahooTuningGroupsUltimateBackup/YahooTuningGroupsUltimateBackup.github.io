I&apos;ve been here for over 5 years,<br/>and have come to know many of you; a good number of you live where<br/>the worst of human nature has evidenced itself.</p><p>It is very difficult to be distant and removed from the terrible<br/>times that people are going through in New York (and Washington, for<br/>that matter). If it were in my home town, I&apos;d be down there,<br/>physically helping. The only obvious thing that I have been able to<br/>do is pray.</p><p>But beyond that, disasters - natural and human-made - not only bring<br/>the need for resources but for the funds that can buy those<br/>resources. Someone mentioned <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> to me on Weds, and I took a<br/>look. They had set up one of their own PayPage accounts to contribute<br/>to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund. When I saw it on Weds<br/>morn, there was around $400,000.00 donated. By tonight, over 100,000<br/>people had contributed nearly $4,000,000.00. It won&apos;t bring back<br/>lives lost, but may help those still in need.</p><p>PayPage Details:<br/>----------------<br/>Title: Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund<br/>Owner: Jonathan Leblang<br/>Description: All of us at <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> are deeply saddened by the<br/>recent tragedies in New York City, Washington, D.C., and southwestern<br/>Pennsylvania, and we extend our sympathies and condolences to those<br/>affected. You can support relief efforts by making a donation to the<br/>American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund. You can contribute from $1<br/>to $100--any donation is greatly appreciated. ALL donated money will<br/>go to the Red Cross to help victims of this and other tragedies--<br/><a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> is waiving its usual fees.</p><p>To take a look at this PayPage, go to:<br/><a href="http://s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/ts/my-pay-page/PKAXFNQH7EKCX">http://s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/ts/my-pay-page/PKAXFNQH7EKCX</a></p><p>Another online clearing-house, if you would like a variety of<br/>national and local agencies to contribute to, is the front page of<br/><a href="http://Helping.Org">Helping.Org</a>:</p><p><a href="http://www.helping.org/index.adp">http://www.helping.org/index.adp</a></p><p>Thanks for tolerating this non-tuning message; to all those<br/>affected, you are in my deepest thoughts and prayers.</p><p>Jon</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>9/14/2001 7:52:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28165">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28165</a></p><p>&gt; To my tuning friends and colleagues,<br/>&gt;</p><p>John has an excellent suggestion here to contribute to the <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a><br/>Red Cross relief effort.</p><p>It&apos;s right on their main page.
