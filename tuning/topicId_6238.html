I just purchased a very good Pappalardo<br/>&gt;&gt; guitar, which eventually can be transformed into another n-ET<br/>&gt;&gt; version, but who&apos;s gonna be the composer?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d love to write an n-ET piece for you, Wim.  Which n-ET?</p><p>That&apos;s a nice proposal! However that&apos;s not exactly what I mend to say in my<br/>last  phrase. It&apos;s a sort of romantic idea, referring to *hidden* existing<br/>compositions waiting for their first performance since a long time. Good<br/>quality music, but simply no performers trained enough for the specific<br/>instrumental efforts they require. I have some phantasies on these kinds of<br/>historical pick-ups:  19t-ET lute compositions from an unknown genious in<br/>the 16t century, recently discovered manuscripts from Constantyn Huygens in<br/>31t-ET dedicated to  his son Christiaan... (still to be found).<br/>Cela dit, even if that&apos;s not what I mend to say, I&apos;d love to set my teeth on<br/>a new Monz&apos; guitarpiece. But wouldn&apos;t it be a good idea to see what you can<br/>do with my my existing instruments? 24t-ET and/or moveable frets with any<br/>octave division you want as long as the number of steps in an octave (equal<br/>or non-equal) stays within a certain limit. I have only twelve frets per<br/>octave but I can *borrow* frets from another octave to go over that<br/>number.  Joe Pehrson recently wrote me a piece for this guitar which I would<br/>like to present to the list very soon.  I&apos;m sorry, but I really cannot just<br/>refret a guitar into n-ET andthen use it for one single composition still to<br/>come.<br/>That&apos;s understandable, isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s too large a step.</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
