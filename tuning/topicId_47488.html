Both pairs have a<br/>vertical stroke in common and differ in two ways: 1) a curved vs. a<br/>straight-line stroke 2) placed on opposite sides of the vertical<br/>stroke.</p><p>Ezra Sims addressed the problem of symbol legibility under adverse<br/>conditions (poor lighting and excessive reading distance) by making a<br/>couple of his 72-ET symbols (the ones for the quartertones) rather<br/>large (i.e., long in the vertical direction, besides being rather<br/>ugly), which makes it more difficult to determine quickly which<br/>notehead is being modified in a polyphonic part or score.  For parts<br/>in sagittal notation that are likely to be read under less-than-ideal<br/>conditions, we recommend using staves that are slightly larger than<br/>usual -- a 10 percent linear magnification would make a significant<br/>difference in legibility.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Dave Keenan sent me the font.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I sent the current draft which has final versions of the 72-ET<br/>symbols<br/>&gt; &gt; and drafts versions of many others.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s arrows upon arrows.

Did you learn your alphabet<br/>&gt; &gt; overnight?  Do you now have any problem distinguishing &quot;J&quot;<br/>from &quot;L&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ###The problem with this is that in training musicians they&apos;re not<br/>&gt; going to take the time to learn this.  Most of them, as Johhny<br/>&gt; Reinhard mentioned, care little about theory (many don&apos;t even take<br/>&gt; much of it in school!) and they just want to play.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it is up to *me* as the composer to present it to them, and it<br/>has<br/>&gt; to be something totally transparent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 72-tET symbols do not appear adequate to me.  I understand that<br/>&gt; they illustrate commas and have their own logic but there is a big<br/>&gt; difference between 16 cents and 33 cents and the arrows don&apos;t show<br/>&gt; these distinctions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not going to tell a player:  &quot;Well here is my notation.  If the<br/>&gt; little arrow is straight and points to the left it&apos;s 16 cents, but<br/>if<br/>&gt; it is just a teeny tiny little tiny bit curvy and points to the<br/>&gt; right, well, we&apos;re talking about 33 cents here...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They&apos;re going to look at my crosseyed.  They *already* look at me<br/>&gt; crosseyed...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nobody is going to play this and, at the moment, I am not inclined<br/>to<br/>&gt; put it on my music, even for &quot;experimental&quot; purposes since it&apos;s so<br/>&gt; ridiculous...</p><p>Let&apos;s step back a little and put this into perspective.  Suppose<br/>you&apos;re writing for just intonation, where the commas represented by<br/>these two symbols are ~21.5 and ~27.3 cents, respectively.  Suddenly<br/>the size difference isn&apos;t so drastic.  The problem is that 72-ET<br/>exaggerates these differences.  Our symbols were designed to progress<br/>in size according to the size of the actual commas in JI, and they<br/>were also designed to be harmonically meaningful in many different<br/>tunings.  You can either have a notation that is meaningful and that<br/>works reasonably well in a lot of different tunings, or you can have<br/>a multitude of separate notations that are optimized to (harmonically<br/>illiterate) performers&apos; expectations for each tuning.  Take your pick.</p><p>But, come on now!  You make it sound like you&apos;re dealing with people<br/>who don&apos;t have the wits to be able to cope with the difference<br/>between a penny and a dime, or a sharp and a double-sharp (ha ha, got<br/>you there!).  When you come right down to it, we&apos;re talking about<br/>whether players will be able to remember and distinguish between<br/>these *two* specific symbols (since I assume that the one for 3deg72<br/>has been judged as acceptable).  Hey, if they need a reason for why<br/>|) is larger than /|, then explain to them that |) stands for a 7-<br/>comma and /| for a 5-comma, and that the characters that we use for<br/>the numbers 7 and 5 are also about the same size.  I know that<br/>statement is logically full of holes, but I&apos;m trying to make the<br/>point that there are numerous instances in life where symbols do not<br/>perfectly express the realities that they are supposed to represent,<br/>but we still manage to get along pretty well with them.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; This is admittedly a bit theoretical, but that is what gives the<br/>&gt; &gt; notation a great deal of flexibility.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ###I read through this and it&apos;s very interesting and it&apos;s great<br/>that<br/>&gt; you have designed such a sophisticated system.  However, it doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; address the question of legibility and differentiation and that, of<br/>&gt; course, I what I&apos;m having problems with...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; which is all the more reason why you should try printing out some<br/>&gt; &gt; music (in a slightly larger size than usual) using the sagittal<br/>&gt; &gt; symbols, then spend a some time looking it over, and after a few<br/>&gt; days let us know what you think.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Well, I&apos;ll continue to give it the benefit of the doubt, and<br/>will<br/>&gt; continue thinking about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, in a complex passage, if a performer is going to see a<br/>whole<br/>&gt; bunch of *very* similar arrows (just with the flags going different<br/>&gt; ways) pretty soon his mind is going to glaze over.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We might as well be playing aleatoric music at *that* point... :)</p><p>Please, just give it a chance (pun intended :-).

But exactly what those eight components should _look_ like, is still up for grabs. And there is still some freedom available in the specific choice of commas (and therefore component combinations) used to notate each ET.</p><p>George and I have indeed spent the last several months in an ivory tower, and agree we need to be brought back to earth, however the 72-ET symbols have barely changed since March 2002. The first year was spent designing the sagittal symbols in full public view, first on tuning, then on tuning-math. What a pity you didn&apos;t object so vehemently to any of the proposals back then. See the dates on some of the .gif and .doc files in<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/notation/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/notation/</a><br/>If it is because you found those versions of the 72-ET symbols to be sufficiently distinct, then there&apos;s no problem.

The way they look in a high resolution printout has nothing to do with the choice of font program. They can all do the same in that regard. I&apos;m currently using Font Creator as it was only US$50, but it has no &quot;hinting&quot; which is what could make the symbols come out on screen the same as the bitmaps we designed earlier. If anyone has experience with, and access to, more powerful font software such as a recent version of Font Lab or Fontographer, and is interested in helping, please email.</p><p>&gt;They look very &quot;artistic..&quot;  In fact, they<br/>&gt;look &quot;too artistic&quot; which, to me, is part of the problem...</p><p>Can you explain this? Do you mean you&apos;d rather they were ugly and looked totally out of keeping with other musical symbols. ;-)</p><p>&gt;The 72-tET symbols do not appear adequate to me.  I understand that<br/>&gt;they illustrate commas and have their own logic but there is a big<br/>&gt;difference between 16 cents and 33 cents and the arrows don&apos;t show<br/>&gt;these distinctions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not going to tell a player:  &quot;Well here is my notation.  If the<br/>&gt;little arrow is straight and points to the left it&apos;s 16 cents, but if<br/>&gt;it is just a teeny tiny little tiny bit curvy and points to the<br/>&gt;right, well, we&apos;re talking about 33 cents here...</p><p>Now this, at last, is valuable criticism. One problem we have is that these symbols must also serve as 5-comma and 7-comma symbols in JI. In JI their sizes are not 17 and 33 cents, but 22 and 27 cents - barely different at all. But since 72-ET is so important we must certainly do better.</p><p>I am surprised that you find the sixth-tone symbol to be only a &quot;teeny tiny little tiny bit&quot; curved, but we could certainly make the radius tighter, such that it is almost square like this.

As we&apos;ve said before, it will often be possible to design a more distinct set of accidentals for any _particular_ tuning, but then musicians will have to learn completely different sets for every tuning, and the same symbol will end up being used with entirely unrelated meanings in different tunings (as the common arrow is now).</p><p>If we are to have a harmonically-based and polyphonically-suited lingua-franca of microtonality, in addition to the cents-from-24-ET notation, then some folks may have to accept some compromise for the good of the whole. Of course everyone thinks their favourite tuning is the most important. But having said that, I&apos;ll agree that 72-ET _is_ very important and I&apos;m sure there is still room for improvement.</p><p>But if not, I suppose I&apos;d rather break something like the trojan sub-system for all multiple of 12-ET, than see the whole system assigned to the dust-bin of history so soon.</p><p>&gt;[I don&apos;t care what side of the f*ing stem it&apos;s on!  :) ]</p><p>I don&apos;t understand the need for profanity here, even in jest. We&apos;ve said from the early days that flipping a symbol horizontally is not sufficient to make it distinct. That&apos;s why one symbol is straight and the other curved. I&apos;m hoping we just have to make the curvature more obvious.</p><p>Otherwise, someone please come up with another set of eight graphical components that can be assembled max-two at a time into a set of maximally distinct symbols having a definite up or down direction, that don&apos;t occupy significantly more space vertically than the conventional accidentals, that won&apos;t be confused with any other music symbols, that have a definite alignment with a notehead, that won&apos;t lose essential detail when merged with staff lines in the two possible positions, and are aesthetically pleasing.

I could probably notate it with Dx Fx Ax instead of E G B,<br/>which would be theoretically more sensible, but then you&apos;d have a C major<br/>triad, for instance, written C Dx Fx, which doesn&apos;t immediately register as<br/>a triad when you look at it. With the scordatura notation, the major and<br/>minor triads all look like triads of some kind (although only A and C major<br/>actually look like a major triad). Still, in most cases I imagine the<br/>keyboard-based notation would make less sense than a theoretical notation<br/>designed for the specific tuning.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2003 8:03:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/47541">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/47541</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;###The problem with this is that in training musicians they&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;not going to take the time to learn this.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; That&apos;s a problem for microtonal music, not microtonal notation.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;***I disagree, Carl.

The admissions!  So, I am not totally in the stratosphere!</p><p>&gt; and agree we need to be brought back to earth, however the 72-ET<br/>symbols<br/>&gt; have barely changed since March 2002. The first year was spent<br/>designing<br/>&gt; the sagittal symbols in full public view, first on tuning, then on<br/>&gt; tuning-math. What a pity you didn&apos;t object so vehemently to any of<br/>the<br/>&gt; proposals back then.

We can make them so<br/>again.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***I don&apos;t think so.  As I recall, I was &quot;complaining&quot; about the<br/>Sagittal notation back then but I probably wasn&apos;t complaining so<br/>vehemently, because I wasn&apos;t seriously considering it for my *own*<br/>music.  Now I am.</p><p>You see, this is part of the problem.

But, I believe you<br/>probably have gathered this by now...</p><p>&gt; &gt;Anyway, I don&apos;t know what font program was used, but they did come<br/>&gt; &gt;out quite nicely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks.

They can all do the same in that<br/>regard.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m currently using Font Creator as it was only US$50, but it has<br/>no<br/>&gt; &quot;hinting&quot; which is what could make the symbols come out on screen<br/>the same<br/>&gt; as the bitmaps we designed earlier. If anyone has experience with,<br/>and<br/>&gt; access to, more powerful font software such as a recent version of<br/>Font Lab<br/>&gt; or Fontographer, and is interested in helping, please email.</p><p>***Quite frankly, the font came out fine.

Do you mean you&apos;d rather they were ugly and<br/>looked<br/>&gt; totally out of keeping with other musical symbols. ;-)<br/>&gt;</p><p>***No, I just meant that with all the little squiggles here and there<br/>and with all the arrows that look the same with just a little<br/>additional squiggle here an there, or a bend, or such like, they look<br/>extraordinarily *elaborated* but still many look very similar to one<br/>another.  That&apos;s what I meant by &quot;artistic&quot; as opposed<br/>to &quot;practical...&quot;  But, of course, they should look &quot;nice...&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt;The 72-tET symbols do not appear adequate to me.  I understand that<br/>&gt; &gt;they illustrate commas and have their own logic but there is a big<br/>&gt; &gt;difference between 16 cents and 33 cents and the arrows don&apos;t show<br/>&gt; &gt;these distinctions.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;m not going to tell a player:  &quot;Well here is my notation.  If the<br/>&gt; &gt;little arrow is straight and points to the left it&apos;s 16 cents, but<br/>if<br/>&gt; &gt;it is just a teeny tiny little tiny bit curvy and points to the<br/>&gt; &gt;right, well, we&apos;re talking about 33 cents here...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now this, at last, is valuable criticism. One problem we have is<br/>that these<br/>&gt; symbols must also serve as 5-comma and 7-comma symbols in JI. In JI<br/>their<br/>&gt; sizes are not 17 and 33 cents, but 22 and 27 cents</p><p>***Got it!  I see what you&apos;re saying here...</p><p>- barely different at<br/>&gt; all. But since 72-ET is so important we must certainly do better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am surprised that you find the sixth-tone symbol to be only<br/>a &quot;teeny tiny<br/>&gt; little tiny bit&quot; curved, but we could certainly make the radius<br/>tighter,<br/>&gt; such that it is almost square like this.

Of course everyone thinks their favourite tuning is<br/>the most<br/>&gt; important.
