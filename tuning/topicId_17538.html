Contrary to assertions posted<br/>last year, recent research demonstrated W. was proud and confident of his<br/>chromatic tuning, and that it was widely used throughout central Germany.</p><p>Last year it was postulated incorrectly that W. offered 12-tET as an<br/>alternative tuning in his &quot;Short Lesson and Addition, how one can tune and<br/>temper well a clavier&quot; which was tagged to his &quot;The most necessary<br/>Observations and Rules How the Bassus Continuus Or Thoroughbass can be well<br/>treated And each who has just a little knowledge of music and the clavier can<br/>learn it on his own.&quot;</p><p>This pamphlet was written for a green beginner.  In it, W. suggests as a<br/>start a rough tuning of 12 equally sized fifths, only to give further<br/>directions for fine tuning well-tempered.  After first making a joke at the<br/>funny sound of the word the Dutch use for the comma, he writes that he<br/>doesn&apos;t want to talk about the comma because it is complicated.  W. referred<br/>instead to his previously published monochords engraved in his &quot;Musical<br/>Temperament&quot; for further details.</p><p>Werckmeister never endorsed equal temperament as an alternative to his<br/>previously published monochords engraved in &quot;Musical Temperament&quot; (1691).</p><p>Even the posthumously published &quot;Musical Paradox&quot; (1707), published by W.&apos;s<br/>children to get some money, refers to &quot;Musical Temperament&quot; for temperament<br/>specifics.  In fact, most every work specifies &quot;Musical Temperament&quot; for<br/>further interest in temperament.  This is the reason that the 2nd edition of<br/>W.&apos;s &quot;Orgel-Probe&quot; left tuning specifics out.  It is because W. has begun<br/>what would become a tradition of referring to others books he had written for<br/>further examination.  Clearly he wanted all his books to be of continuous<br/>value, and to be purchased.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Werckmeister wrote of the common chromatic tuning as early as<br/>1681,  three years before J.S. Bach was born.  When W. died, J.S. was getting<br/>married in Muhlhausen and they never did meet.  However, W.&apos;s chromatic<br/>tuning scheme was the only game in town that inquiring minds could agree<br/>upon.  The light of God was shining down bright on this music, and<br/>Werckmeister lit the way.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>p.s. besides there&apos;s mucho evidence for the cultural connections, and Bach<br/>definitely read Werckmeister&apos;s &quot;Orgel-Probe&quot; besides.</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2001 7:09:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17573">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17573</a></p><p>The light of God was shining down bright on this music, and<br/>Werckmeister lit the way.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Mein gott, Johnny, you&apos;re starting to sound like Ashcroft!</p><p>(Just kidding)</p><p>Joseph<br/>______ ___ _____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
