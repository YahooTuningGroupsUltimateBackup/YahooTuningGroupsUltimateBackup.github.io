Perhaps the main purpose is to use neutral thirds? Another possibility would be to use a generator equal to the cube root of either 15/8 (which would make 3/2 and 5/4 mistuned by the same amount)or 9/5 (then this would go for 3/2 and 6/5). But this would mean a clear preference for major thirds over minor thirds or vice versa.

Many other temperaments of the same or lower complexity are more accurate. But there are other considerations. It has a 7-note MOS, which is usually a good sign that it might have one or more musically useful modes. In this case, it has two modes with a tonic chord that has a perfect fifth (using A for the large step and B for the smaller step): A A B A B A B and A B A A B A B. For any other consonant fifths you have to use notes outside the basic MOS. One thing that&apos;s apparent is how little difference there is between major and minor. The 1/4 keyboard in Erv Wilson&apos;s generalized keyboard classification system (<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/key.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/key.PDF</a>) is a good match for this temperament. One interesting thing is that it splits the major third into two equal steps without being a meantone.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  I had an example on my old Comcast web page that used gorgo temperament.<br/>&gt;&gt;  I chose it as much for its melodic properties as anything else, but it<br/>&gt;&gt;  also illustrates some of the potential for 7-limit harmony.<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, you seem to be more successful than I was.

Maybe my problem there was &gt; that I find the two intervals of 6/5 and 5/4 to be of such a different &gt; nature that I simply don&rsquo;t know how to &bdquo;effectively&ldquo; treat a tuning &gt; where they turn into one thing. Perhaps the main purpose is to use &gt; neutral thirds? Another possibility would be to use a generator equal to &gt; the cube root of either 15/8 (which would make 3/2 and 5/4 mistuned by &gt; the same amount)or 9/5 (then this would go for 3/2 and 6/5). But this &gt; would mean a clear preference for major thirds over minor thirds or vice &gt; versa. Okay, the cbrt(15/8) choice sounds acceptable to me, maybe I&rsquo;ll &gt; try it one day too - and hear what it sounds like.<br/>&gt; &gt; Petr</p><p>One way to deal with something like dicot temperament, to create a distinction similar to major vs. minor, is to change the spacing of chords. I.e. rather than CEG - ACE, do something like CGE - CAE. Also, dicot is one of those temperaments that sounds better with slightly stretched octaves.</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2009 11:38:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marcel de Velde wrote:<br/>&gt;     It&apos;s one point that&apos;s getting lost in this whole JI vs. meantone<br/>&gt;     thread.

For example, in the case of 81/80, the 2,3,5 prime generator mapping is &quot;0, 1, 4&quot;, which means that DL is 1 (i.e. the difference between the mapping of 2 and the mapping of 3) and DH is 4 (between mappings of 2 and 5). To pick a different temperament, for 16875/16384, the generator mapping is &quot;0, -4, 3&quot; and therefore DL is 3 (between mappings of 2 and 5) and DH is 7 (between mappings for 3 and 5). So if we are staying with 5-limit temperaments, then I start with a major triad and keep adding or subtracting DL from the generator numbers (let&apos;s call them A for the lowest, B for the middle, and C for the highest number). If I&apos;m adding, then I change C to a value lower than A in order the highest difference between the numbers was still DH. If I&apos;m subtracting, I change A to a value higher than C (actually, only if this doesn&apos;t get me out of the minimum generator range). I do this a few times until I eventually end up with the same numbers with which I started. So for the case of meantone, for example, I&apos;ll start with &quot;0_1_4&quot; and let&apos;s say I&apos;ll decide to subtract DL (which is 1 here). But instead of using the actual result of &quot;-1_0_3&quot;, I&apos;ll change the -1 to 4, which means that &quot;0_3_4&quot; will be the generator mapping for the second chord. Then I&apos;ll subtract 1 again, which makes &quot;-1_2_3&quot; (this time I don&apos;t make any other changes as I want the overall generator range used so far to be at its minimum, which is 5; if I changed the -1 to 6, then this would be 6). Then I subtract 1 again and change the resulting -2 to 5, so that I get &quot;1_2_5&quot;.

To show the meantone example at its extreme, I could happily start with major triads a fifth apart (like C, F, Bb, Eb, Ab). And I can immediately see that not only is G contained in C major but also in Eb major. And not only is C contained in C major but also in Ab major. But if I leave the progression of major triads as it is, then the highest tone in the chain of fifths will be E (i.e. 4 generators away from C) and the lowest tone in the chain will be Ab (-4 generators), which occupies a total range of 8 generators. If I change one of the generator numbers, I can stay in a smaller generator range without actually disrupting the effective descending by fifths in any way and eventually I&apos;ll get to the same chord as the first one. So if, instead of playing C major and F major, I play C major and A minor, then the fact that E-G go down a fifth to A-C is still there but the total generator range used is still 4, not 5 as in the case of C major and F major. When I then go down one more fifth, I get D minor. I could play D major instead of D minor but this would change the total generator range to 6 so I&apos;ll leave the D minor there to keep the total generator range at 5, which means that all three tones go down a fifth. When I go down another fifth then, I get G minor; but this time there&apos;s no problem in changing Bb to B so I&apos;ll use G major instead, which means that D-A goes down a fifth to G-D. And finally I play C major again, making all the tones go a fifth down once more. -- When I convert this chord progression to generator numbers, I get the thing I described in my previous message.

And why<br/>&gt; is this desirable? etc.</p><p>Well, my first question was how to find a comma pump for any particular temperament with as few chords as possible. And my first idea for answering that question was to start simply by repeatedly shifting major triads up or down by the same interval (like fifths in meantone) until I got to a chord which had one pitch equal to any one in the initial triad. But this didn&apos;t sound nice to me because after, let&apos;s say, going down a fifth for three times, I then had to go down by a minor third (or up a major sixth) to get to the initial chord (i.e. one step in the negative direction repeated three times and then three steps in the positive direction), which made the last two chords sound a bit &quot;tonally distant&quot;. Because I didn&apos;t find this to be one of the best ways to do it, it soon occured to me that I also needed to minimize the generator range, which eventually gave me the possibility to basically keep going down by fifths without having to do things like going three fifths up at a time then. And because a major triad in meantone spans 4 generators, then I can do this task, if I&apos;m subtracting, simply by changing the lowest generator number to a value which is 4 higher than the middle value (then becoming the lowest). And voila, when I keep doing this, I&apos;ll eventually get to the same chord as the initial one. And this also confirms that, in meantone, I need at least 7 tones in the scale to be able to realize the chord progression.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
