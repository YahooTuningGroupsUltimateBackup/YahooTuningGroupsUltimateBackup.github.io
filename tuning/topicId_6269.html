I don&apos;t think so.</p><p>Positive - he says it twice.</p><p>And for two of the four pianos, actually.</p><p>From the first page of the score:</p><p>&gt; Les pianos 1 et 3 doivent etre accordes au diapason normal,<br/>&gt; les pianos 2 et 4 a un quart de ton plus haut.  L&apos;orchestre<br/>&gt; est divise en deux groupes - I et II, dont chacun se compose<br/>&gt; d&apos;un piano au diapason normal et d&apos;un autre a un quart de ton<br/>&gt; plus haut.  Chaque groupe realise ainsi d&apos;une facon complete<br/>&gt; le systeme de quarts de ton et forme un tout homogene.</p><p>My translation:</p><p>&gt; The 1st and 3rd pianos must be tuned in the normal way,<br/>&gt; the 2nd and 4th a quarter-tone higher.  The orchestra is<br/>&gt; divided into 2 groups - I and II, of which each is composed<br/>&gt; of a piano in normal tuning and another a quarter-tone higher.<br/>&gt; Each group thus realizes in a complete way the system of<br/>&gt; quarter-tones and forms a homogenous whole.</p><p>Wyschnegradsky goes on recommend other ways to acheive a<br/>homogenous sound, and says that &apos;the whole work will always<br/>have to be executed under the direction of a conductor&apos;.</p><p>&gt; Though, Ives did want a piano tuned up for his &quot;Three<br/>&gt; Quarter-tone Pieces&quot; for 2 pianos.</p><p>Wasn&apos;t this a fairly standard way of achieving quarter-tone<br/>music in the first few decades of this century?  (You&apos;d<br/>know that better than me, Johnny.)</p><p>&gt; When we recorded it for the CD Joshua Pierce found that the<br/>&gt; touch of the piano had changed radically.  The top lines have<br/>&gt; more punch and bounce. There is a difference in the music.<br/>&gt; (Though most piano owners would rather the tuning was flatter<br/>&gt; rather than sharper.)</p><p>You guys did Wyschnegradsky&apos;s _Zarathoustra_ and I missed it??!!<br/>Aaarrrrrghhh !!!!!!</p><p>So it sounds like you&apos;re saying that you tuned the second pair<br/>of pianos *down* when you recorded it...?</p><p>And I only added that bit about &apos;except for minor<br/>differences of timbre and range&apos; as an afterthought.<br/>Apparently it makes much more of a difference than I<br/>thought, that Wyschnegradsky asks to tune two of the<br/>pianos up rather than down...</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

It was the Ives 3<br/>Quarter-tone Pieces that we recorded.  I do have a recordig of Zarathustra<br/>played over the radio with Wyschnegradsky in the KPFK Berklee studio with<br/>well known DJ - Amirkhanian.  I believe that Pierre Boulez is playing one of<br/>the 4 piano parts.</p><p>Boulez is one of the Honorary Advisors of the Wyschnegradsky Society in<br/>Paris.  He is not really hostile.  There is a story people tell of<br/>Wyschnegradsky bringing a score to Boulez who had said he would look it over.<br/> A long time passed before Wyschnegradsky returned to ask about the piece.<br/>Boulez kept Wyschnegradsky waiting outside his door while he retrieved the<br/>unlooked at volume of work.</p><p>It could have been worse, Boulez was much nastier to Stravinsky...at least at<br/>first.</p><p>And no, there was no impetus to tune up a quartertone in the the earlier part<br/>of this century.  The idea is usually to go a quartertone lower because that<br/>puts less tension on the strings which already has an increadible amount of<br/>tension.  Who wants to break strings?</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
