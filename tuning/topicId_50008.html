The basic idea is to take all the notes that are sounding<br/>at any given time and to retune them so as to maximize a measure<br/>of &quot;sensory consonance,&quot; or perhaps more properly to minimize the<br/>&quot;sensory dissonance.&quot; This measure is built up from the Plomp and Levelt<br/>curves for the roughness between pairs of sine waves by assuming that<br/>the dissonances between all pairs of simultaneously sounding partials<br/>are additive. For harmonic sounds (likemost of those in &quot;excitalking,&quot;<br/>this comes down something very close to JI, but a JI in which there<br/>are no fixed pitches at all (because the pitches always wiggle around<br/>depending on what else is sounding at the time).</p><p>Of course, there are a number of practical details -- and I talk about<br/>some of these in a paper in the J.

I am wondering how you deal with a disonnace function whose<br/>derivative is not monotonic, or am I leaping to conclusions that you<br/>did things the way I was turning over in my mind? I also wonder if<br/>you assume a certain timbre in advance.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve put a version online at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/adaptun2002.pdf">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/adaptun2002.pdf</a></p><p>Ah, thanks.
