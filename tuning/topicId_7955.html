One option, which in fact I do, is to seek out such<br/>&gt;overlaps, evaluate them for duration, and essentially throw away the<br/>&gt;very brief complex chords formed when they don&apos;t last longer than some<br/>&gt;preset time, which I typically set to 64 msec.</p><p>My procedure only tunes the five loudest notes at a given time; less if<br/>there are less than five unique (after octave equivalence) pitches sounding.</p><p>&gt;Do you plan to have any chords actually tuned to 12-tET?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>&gt;What is your thought about considering the duration of chords?  If I<br/>&gt;play a chord for a very brief length of time, should it have as much<br/>&gt;pull on tuning as a long sustained chord?</p><p>In my version, duration isn&apos;t a factor.  But keep in mind it was designed<br/>to be composed for, rather than to retune existing music (although you<br/>might get many interesting results!).  It is for the composer who wants to<br/>work in extended JI, thinking of chord progressions as common-tone paths<br/>through chord space (after Wilson), but who only has provisions for scoring<br/>in 12-tone (say he uses MIDI).</p><p>&gt;How will you handle drift?  The ol&apos; comma pump, repeated many times?</p><p>Ignores drift entirely.  Repeated pump makes the music go flat.</p><p>&gt;Will you consider the length of time between chords?  Two conflicting<br/>&gt;chords back-to-back vs. separated by a long silence, say.</p><p>Silence is ignored.</p><p>&gt;In your scheme, can chords, or the notes within them, interact when<br/>&gt;something else intervenes?</p><p>Just the five loudest notes at any given time.  Notes may be retuned as<br/>they sound, if that&apos;s the question.</p><p>&gt;If there are three successive chords, and only the outer two have a C, say,<br/>&gt;will the two C&apos;s consider their relative tuning?</p><p>Nope.  In a way, I&apos;m actually after &quot;strict&quot; JI here.  I call it adaptive<br/>because it&apos;s getting at JI with only 12-pitches, moving the tonic is all<br/>over the place.  But I&apos;m trying more to access high-limit pitch sets than I<br/>am trying to get JI to conform to meantone logic.</p><p>&gt;When you refer to &quot;ticks&quot; in a MIDI file, what does this mean?  I&apos;m<br/>&gt;aware of the MIDI time scheme, but if nothing is changing, there&apos;s<br/>&gt;nothing to focus on, yes?</p><p>Just the shortest unit of action in the MIDI-verse.  Yes, many ticks will<br/>not feature a change (although not as many as one might think, since event<br/>loudness is sampled at each tick), but the thing is: ain&apos;t nothin&apos; gettin&apos;<br/>past this baby.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7959 href="#7959">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2000 7:31:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; [John deLaubenfels, TD 497.3]<br/>&gt;&gt; How will you handle drift?
