If I ever made it to an event of theirs, I&apos;d probably take them out for a round of drinks, and it would end up costing more than that. *If* (and when) I decide to enter, I would consider that small sum of money my way of contributing to their little fledgling organization, nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>YMMV. Do as you will. There are many larger, more important issues in the world to get hyperbolic over.</p><p>Yours in a joyous world and coupon-clipping,<br/>Jon</p></div>
