Is the total cross<br/>sectional area all that matters, regardless of shape?<br/>I doubt it.  I would guess it only matters in the direction<br/>of vibration, so ribbons would seem to make sense.  They<br/>would also kill side-to-side modes of vibration, which<br/>presumably only hurt power transfer to the soundboard.<br/>If one ribbon could stand in for three strings, it&apos;d make<br/>tuning easier, and it would presumably save space along<br/>the keyboard, which is one of the blocks to building<br/>acoustic keyboards with &gt; 12 tones/octave.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
