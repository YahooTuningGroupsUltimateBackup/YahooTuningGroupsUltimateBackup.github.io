Glad you found this!</p><p>None of my doing, just pasted the names Manuel gave into Google<br/>and it was close to the top of the list.</p><p>I wonder how large the original is. Seems to me it must be<br/>pretty large to be readable. How does the performer read<br/>through the music I wonder, or does it have to be<br/>memorised in its entirety?</p><p>Would like to see the original.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
