They were the founding<br/>members of the French &quot;spectral&quot; school.</p><p>They have written wonderful-sounding music.   Some of my favorites:<br/>Murail&apos;s  &quot;13 Colours of the Sun&quot;  (I forget what it is in French),<br/>&quot;L&apos;esprit de dune&quot;, &quot;desintegrations&quot; (all for chamber orchestra) and &quot;le<br/>barque mystique.&quot;  (for piano violin and cello).</p><p>Their notation is 90% with 1/4-tones, sometimes with 1/8s,  the emphasis<br/>being on practicality.  Before anyone cries &quot;lame!&quot;, answer this:  have<br/>you written gorgeous orchestral scores, with vividly memorable microtonal<br/>sounds, (and talk about orchestration, baby!!!!  It&apos;s on a par with<br/>Messiaen and Ravel. . . ), that have been performed by symphony ochestras<br/>world wide?  . . . didn&apos;t think so.</p><p>(I&apos;m *defending* them here. . . .at school, I&apos;m on the *other* side,<br/>extolling the benefits of alternative ETs, pure JI, and whatever other<br/>&quot;impractical&quot; microtonal explorations. . . .)</p><p>In any case, they are perhaps the major strand of microtonality in Europe<br/>in the last 50 years. . . .  .Murail&apos;s arrival at Columbia, in a sense,<br/>led me to ask, &quot;hey, wait a minute, what&apos;s been happening this side of the<br/>Atlantic?&quot;, which led me to this list, among other places. . . . . .</p><p>and yes, they have worked at the evil IRCAM. . . however, it&apos;s important<br/>to note that for many years they were kept out of the institution by<br/>Boulez;  finally, they became so important that he could no longer ignore<br/>them.  In a way, sociologically speaking, they are the &quot;minimalists&quot; of<br/>France. . .</p><p>Anyway, polemics and aesthetics aside, the music is great.    (All of it<br/>involves instruments, some pieces with electronics.)  I recommend it.</p><p>cb</p></div><h3><a id=33795 href="#33795">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2002 6:11:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Being a student at Columbia, I&apos;ve heard a lot of Grisey and ...</p><p>Chris, I just wanted to thank you for serendipitously answering a<br/>question: I was at a wonderful symposium today with Gyorgi Ligetti,<br/>and when the topic of the &apos;spectral&apos; composers came up there was one<br/>name mentioned I couldn&apos;t understand, or hadn&apos;t heard of.</p><p>I do believe, now, that it was Grisey!</p><p>Great afternoon, facilitated by James Tenney in a very helpful way...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S.
