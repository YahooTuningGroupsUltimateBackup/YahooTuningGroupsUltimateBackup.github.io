(Also about<br/>this triad on G: requiring the 5th to be pure is what differentiates<br/>Zarlino&apos;s tuning from Fogliano&apos;s - doesn&apos;t Fogliano tune C-D 10:9, so that<br/>D-A is pure and the wolf is between G and D?)</p><p>Speaking of major/minor and triads, it might be important to remember that<br/>Zarlino considered E-G-C, say, a *minor* sonority because it has a minor<br/>3rd and 6th above the bass. There is still no recognition in Zarlino of<br/>inversional equivalence of triads. Lippius has been mentioned by Monz and<br/>Margo, and he&apos;s the guy to thank for that.</p><p>It&apos;s also interesting that Zarlino can&apos;t escape the conclusion that the<br/>6/4 chord 3:4:5 &quot;should&quot; be more consonant, according to his theory, than<br/>the 5/3 4:5:6 - just like Helmholtz, 300 years later. I can&apos;t quite<br/>remember how he squirms out of it - does anyone have it handy to check?</p><p>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=15358 href="#15358">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
