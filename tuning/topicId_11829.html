Well, after<br/>&gt;this experiment, it became clear that there is a whole range of<br/>&gt;well-temperaments, ranging from 12-tET to tunings where the worst fifth<br/>&gt;is upwards of 710 cents, that come out as local minima. Since (I did<br/>&gt;not mention this yet, so I&apos;m glad you asked) the total discordance of<br/>&gt;these scales was greater the farther they were from 12-tET, it is clear<br/>&gt;that 12-tET is the only true local minimum here.</p><p>Well, given a requirement to optimize for all keys equally, 12-tET<br/>undoubtedly IS the best possible tuning, and that result would fall out<br/>by any number of optimization processes.</p><p>&gt;I can&apos;t be too upset at my optimizer for not always converging to<br/>&gt;12-tET, since 11-dimensional space can be hard to navigate.</p><p>Yes, I do appreciate that!</p><p>&gt;However, there may be some significance to the fact that all the<br/>&gt;well-temperaments significantly different from 12-tET that the<br/>&gt;optimizer got stuck at share a common pattern, beyond the obvious one<br/>&gt;you mentioned -- anyone see it?</p><p>Why don&apos;t you just share it with us?

Because the biggest dips in the harmonic entropy curve are at<br/>     3/2, it&apos;s &quot;not a bad approximation&quot; to say that this is all that<br/>     matters.  You further emphasize this by saying that, between<br/>     major and minor seconds, the curve is &quot;featureless&quot;.</p><p>   . But, when I suggest you reduce the strength of minor seconds and<br/>     eliminate the unison dip to keep the scales from collapsing into<br/>     others with fewer notes, you say you don&apos;t want to &quot;bias the<br/>     results.&quot;</p><p>You say you&apos;re looking for &quot;interesting new scales&quot;.  Could you better<br/>define what makes a scale &quot;interesting&quot; in your view?</p><p>How do you test for convergence in a particular run of your optimization<br/>program?  The results you posted have precision to .01 cents in some<br/>values, but only to integer cents in others - what does this mean?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
