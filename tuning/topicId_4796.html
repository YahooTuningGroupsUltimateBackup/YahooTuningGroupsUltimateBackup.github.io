Many<br/>of the &quot;glitches&quot; in the original have been detected and removed (and,<br/>with less frenzied retuning motion, the files are also a LOT smaller!).<br/>As before, there are three choices:</p><p>   be-ps-08.mid    As originally recorded by Bunji Hisamori<br/>   be-ps-08z5.mid  Retuned to 5-limit (sevenths tuned 16/9 of root).<br/>   be-ps-08z7.mid  Retuned to 7-limit (sevenths tuned  7/4 of root).</p><p>I&apos;m not going to claim this is the best that can be done - the<br/>refinement process can go on indefinitely - but to my ears this is good<br/>stuff!  I&apos;m waiting for permission to post some wonderful Brahms<br/>sequences by the same artist, including piano sonatas 1, 2, and 3, and<br/>I&apos;m still open to tune other midi files (single voice, though several<br/>tracks in is OK).</p><p>I&apos;ll post info about the algorithms I&apos;m using if there is interest.<br/>Keep in mind they&apos;re still evolving on the edges.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
