She was recently<br/>featured on Frank Oteri&apos;s American Music Center website during the<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; discussion.  I mentioned to Frank that I really didn&apos;t<br/>think she was a &quot;card carrying&quot; microtonalist, since she really<br/>wasn&apos;t concerned about the systems, but only the gliss.  (Actually, I<br/>know Lois and like her... this was just a matter of debate).  Frank<br/>responded by suggesting that he wanted *all different kinds* of<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; composers represented... and that is why he included<br/>her...

The tones themselves would decompose and recompose with each successive chord.  You<br/>have to take amplitude and pitch into constant consideration for every partial - quite a<br/>daunting task!

You<br/>&gt;&gt; can sustain this kind of pseudo-gliss as long as you want.<br/>&gt;Eventually the<br/>&gt;&gt; listener realizes he&apos;s been tricked. It&apos;s sort of the audio<br/>&gt;equivalent of<br/>&gt;&gt; the barber pole illusion ... you can watch it for hours and even<br/>&gt;though you<br/>&gt;&gt; *know* those stripes aren&apos;t rising, it sure looks like they are. :-)<br/>&gt;I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;&gt; forgotten exactly what this trick is called<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Shepard tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;See <a href="http://www.cameron.edu/~lloydd/webdoc1.html">http://www.cameron.edu/~lloydd/webdoc1.html</a><br/>&gt;Not sher this is the same thing, but Region IV of Stockhausen&apos;s &quot;Hymnen&quot;<br/>has extensive passages of glisses that sound similar to what&apos;s described<br/>here. I&apos;ve not had the record for 20-some odd years, but as I remember it,<br/>the chord is comprised os something akin to a whole-tone structure, starts<br/>quietly at the top of its slide, gets louder, and fades about a major sixth<br/>lower. As it fades, the same thing starts again and so on and even though<br/>you know the cycle&apos;s repeated, it always sounds like the phenomenon is<br/>continuously going downward, it&apos;s just that your brain wonders why it never<br/>gets below the narrow range. One helluva powerful effect. Anyone know<br/>details of what&apos;s actually going on? I&apos;m only figgerin&apos; according to what I<br/>hear. Sher wish I had that thing again but don&apos;t wanna pay the hickuppy<br/>price of the CD from Stockhausen&apos;s web site.
