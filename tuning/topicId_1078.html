It is, instead, to develop new musical structures and<br/>logic to use even just a new one in a meaningful way (for human beings) that<br/>does not repeat the same basic implementation of the ideas of classic<br/>harmony (tonic - dominant - subdominant, tension, dissonance and so forth.)<br/>Unfortunately, I haven&apos;t heard thus far any &quot;microtonal&quot; music which isn&apos;t<br/>conceptually a modification of those classic patterns, or random<br/>combinations</p><p>Don&#xFFFD;t &quot;random combinations&quot; and &quot;meaningful way[s]&quot; tell at least as much<br/>about the quoted observer as they do they do about the  examples observed?</p><p>&gt;The challenge is to make sense out of it. On the other hand, which kind of<br/>conditioning would it take to fully understand such a new approach?</p><p>Don&#xFFFD;t these decidedly human conditions of &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;understanding&quot; (more<br/>or less) settle themselves with a natural fidelity to talent, inspiration,<br/>and resourcefulness?* Hasn&#xFFFD;t the common course** of creativity and<br/>inspiration time and time again allowed talented/resourceful individuals to<br/>&#xFFFD;hear&#xFFFD; (_and give voice to_) &#xFFFD;phenomena&#xFFFD; the likes of which any &quot;one&quot;<br/>slumbering orderliness [or half-adumbrated contour*** of some underlying<br/>&quot;art of space&quot;****] would be hard pressed to call its own?</p><p>Dan</p><p>*[Although it was in a different context&#xFFFD;] Daniel Wolf offered a wonderfully<br/>instructive example of this when he said: &quot;That brings me back to a point<br/>about minimalism which ought to be made. Many of the landmark works of early<br/>minimalism used as simple a surface (i.e. the &quot;notes&quot;) as possible in order<br/>to make it possible to hear phenomena that were not normally in the<br/>perceptual domain of traditional concert music. This required radical shifts<br/>in the ways one listened to music&#xFFFD;. It is clear that many listeners never<br/>made those shifts, but that is a matter of individual preference&#xFFFD; &quot; [Digest<br/>59, message 3]</p><p> **&quot;Practically, metaphysics and philosophy proper are not separated, and<br/>they are not marked off in sharp distinction from science, on the one hand,<br/>and common sense, on the other.&quot; [Charles E. Seashore., &quot;Psychology of<br/>Music&quot;, pg. 376]</p><p>***I remember Joseph Yasser [In his epic 1932 &quot;A Theory of Evolving<br/>Tonality&quot;] using the example of Scriabin&#xFFFD;s &quot;mystic chord&quot; to argue for the<br/>prognosticated &quot;preliminary stages&quot; of &quot;such a new approach&#xFFFD;&quot;</p><p>****&quot;Raumkunst&quot; is an interesting architectural term that was used by Joseph<br/>Yasser while arguing for the validity of a sort of fundamental (or perhaps<br/>deterministic) &quot;art of space.&quot;</p></div>
