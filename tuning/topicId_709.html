This is also fair<br/>warning to those who believe serialism is moribund to hit your delete key<br/>now.</p><p>Last week I sent the following note to a few friends.  It is a description<br/>of a &quot;hyper-12T operation&quot; that I probably won&apos;t have time to work up into<br/>publishable form for some time, but I wanted as many comments on<br/>compositional possibilities as possible.</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;****************</p><p>It seems I&apos;ve stumbled onto a &quot;hyper-atonal&quot; version of a Cohn function<br/>(sans the requirement that the transformations have to always produce a<br/>TTO version of the same chord).  After moving recently I&apos;ve misplaced my<br/>copy of David Clampitt&apos;s paper on his &quot;Q-relation&quot; which also might have<br/>some bearing here.  Whether or not it&apos;s far-fetched to relate the<br/>following to the Cohn function is your call, but the operation (P for<br/>parity) sure is parsimonious.</p><p>One of my primary theory motivations lately has been the idea of<br/>transformations between spaces of different sizes, thus the recent foray<br/>into scale theory resulting in a &quot;warp&quot; function to generate hypertonal<br/>structures.  But in the back of my mind has always been the generalization<br/>of 12-tone and other atonal structures and systems into the microtonal<br/>sphere, i.e., the development of &quot;hyperatonal&quot; compositional<br/>strategies.</p><p>This past weekend I was doing some pre-compositional exercises and came<br/>across what I think is a very interesting operation.  It started in<br/>quartertones, but then I tried it in the more manageable 12-space, and<br/>some startling things began to fall out.  The results are obviously<br/>applicable to any n-TET space where n is even.</p><p>I started by constructing a &quot;warped&quot; row of 12 notes in 24-space using the<br/>well-explored and exploited 014-trichord as a generator.  I can&apos;t remember<br/>my original 12T row for sure this morning, but I think it was this:</p><p>&#x9;0 4 3   8 7 e   6 9 t   2 5 1</p><p>I then divided the row into 3 successive tetras and raised the middle one<br/>by a quartertone:</p><p>S:&#x9;(0  4  3) (8     7+  e+) (6+ 9+     t) (2  5  1)</p><p>This effectively leaves the outer trichords untouched in an ambivalent<br/>12-space while warping the inner trichords unambivalently into 24-space.<br/>The outer tetras on the other hand remain in &quot;even parity&quot; 12-space<br/>compared to the inner tetra in &quot;odd parity&quot; 12-space (all this using the<br/>partition of the chromatic into two WT-scales as a model).  In Z/24, then,<br/>I translated S to:</p><p>S&apos;:&#x9;0  8  6  16  15  23  13  19  20  4  10  2</p><p>I then dutifully (and laboriously) generated the usual 4 (hyper)TTO lists<br/>(call inv &amp; transp in any space HTTOs -- conveys bad 12-TET bias though),<br/>and proceded to write some brief exercises for a scordatura string quartet<br/>(1st &amp; va tuned 1/4-tone up).</p><p>But before reaching a reasonable compositional facility here, I decided to<br/>see what the S&apos; complement looked like.  O fortuna! -- a z-related twin<br/>that looks like some sort of skewed-inversion of S&apos;--</p><p>T*(unordered):&#x9;1  3  5  7  9  11  12  14  17  18  21  22</p><p>$({S&apos;}) = 2 2 2 2 2 3 2 1 3 1 3 1<br/>$(T*)   = 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 3 1 3 1 3</p><p>Since I know of no HTTO to get from elements of S&apos; to elements of T*, I<br/>decided to see how much I could get T* to &quot;look like&quot; S&apos; and came up with<br/>the row</p><p>T&apos;:&#x9;0  8  6  16  17  11  13  21  20  4  10  2</p><p>and worked out the HTTO&apos;s.</p><p>Now, 24 integers ain&apos;t easy to work with, and I had to admit that I wasn&apos;t<br/>working in a totally &quot;free&quot; 24-space system since it was highly dependent<br/>on 12-space as a reference -- even my notation was bound by inflections of<br/>12-space notation -- the curse of the microtonalist. So I ended up with<br/>HTTO charts that were 12-tone with pluses (as I started out with). This<br/>quickly made something clear even to me when I spotted the S look-alike<br/>complement Almost-T:</p><p>S:&#x9;&#x9;0  4  3  8  7+ e+ 6+ 9+ t  2  5  1<br/>Almost-T:&#x9;0+ 4+ 3+ 8+ 6  7  9  e  t+ 2+ 5+ 1+</p><p>So I corrected my &quot;mistake&quot; by rearranging T to conform to the operation<br/>&quot;keep the integers but exchange their parities&quot; making:</p><p>T:&#x9;&#x9;0+ 4+ 3+ 8+ 7  e  6  9  t+ 2+ 5+ 1+</p><p>Obviously, in 24-space notation, this operation translates (and quickly<br/>generalizes) to something like &quot;evens become odd and odds become even.&quot;<br/>To play with it a little, I tried this definition of &quot;parity<br/>transposition&quot; Pn:</p><p>&#x9;If element e is even, P/n/e = e+n;<br/>&#x9;        if e is odd,  P/n/e = e-n<br/>&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;(all mod space cardinality)</p><p>This would relate S and T above as T = P/1/S with the inverse<br/>S = P&apos;/1/T = P/-1/T.</p><p>I&apos;ve been ranging n = 0,1,2,..., for exploration of examples, but of<br/>course if we set P = P/1/, say, (and retaining I = P/0/ for an identity)<br/>then the ranging can be expressed as composition; e.g., P(PX) = P/2/X or<br/>P^2^(X) and so on.</p><p>For manageable tests I took P back into 12-space and found some<br/>interesting characteristics, which I think are far from exhausted yet, so<br/>the following assume 12-space.</p><p>~~~P partitions all of Z/12&apos;s subsets -- e.g., every trichord can be<br/>placed into one (and only one) of 6 P-partition classes.</p><p>~~~The members of any given P-set (all sets generated by P/n/, n ranging<br/>over 0,...,11) are themselves often (always? - haven&apos;t tested yet) related<br/>by other operations -- e.g. trichords again: starting with X = {0,1,2}<br/>which produces the following P-set:<br/>&#x9;         set&#x9;  $&#x9;vector<br/>a&#x9;P/0/&#x9;0 1 2&#x9;1 1 t&#x9;210000<br/>b&#x9;P/1/&#x9;1 0 3&#x9;1 2 9&#x9;111000<br/>c&#x9;P/2/&#x9;2 e 4&#x9;3 2 7&#x9;011010<br/>d&#x9;P/3/&#x9;3 t 5&#x9;2 5 5&#x9;010020<br/>e&#x9;P/4/&#x9;4 9 6&#x9;2 3 7&#x9;011010<br/>f&#x9;P/5/&#x9;5 8 7&#x9;2 1 9&#x9;111000<br/>g&#x9;P/6/*&#x9;...&#x9;...&#x9;...<br/>etc.<br/>&#x9;* P/6/ begins repetition of the string series since $P/+6/=$P/-6/<br/>&#x9;~~~ g etc. are all T6-related to a through f<br/>&#x9;~~~ b,f and c,e are TnI-related<br/>&#x9;~~~ a,d; b,c; e,f are TnM5-related</p><p>~~~Since the evens and odds retain their respective EVEN intervallic<br/>relations throughout the consecutive operations, all even vector entries<br/>remain the same.  But, since you are adding +n or -n, the odd entries<br/>(which represent the vector between the even subset and odd subset) trace<br/>a careening diagonal path as the P-related sets are generated.  Thus,<br/>displaying only the odd vector components from the previous example:</p><p>component: 1 3 5</p><p>           2 0 0<br/>          ( \<br/>           1 1 0<br/>            \ \<br/>           0 1 1<br/>              \ )<br/>           0 0 2<br/>              / )<br/>           0 1 1<br/>            / /<br/>           1 1 0<br/>          ( /<br/>           2 0 0<br/>          ( \<br/>            ...</p><p>~~~ The behavior of the odd vector components in a partition class may<br/>explain why m5- and z-related sets (in 12-space) are often members of the<br/>same P-set.

Transposition by 1 through<br/>5 would then be a kind of &quot;atonal modulation&quot; (I love that one) which<br/>would effectively scramble the appearances of the basic single trichordal<br/>building block, the 026-SC (every one of which is contained in the<br/>P-set-class &amp; partitions each hexachord due to the construction of the<br/>source set), and hence 026 might profitably be employed in modulation as<br/>a common chord (though other common-chord possibilities are interesting as<br/>well -- e.g., SC-016 appears in every hexachord).</p><p>Serialism is dead.

Around 1948 Pierre<br/>Boulez<br/>and Milton Babbitt independently discovered &quot;total serialism&quot;, which means the<br/>row is used for as many parameters as the composer wants to use. Karlheinz<br/>Stockhausen applied the row not only to individual notes (Punkte - points),<br/>but to<br/>groups (Gruppen) of notes, and even to large scale form (Momente).</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/1999 5:49:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Message text written by Bram</p><p>&gt;That sounds a lot like other descriptions I&apos;ve heard of atonal music.

The works of Schoenberg, Webern, Berg composed in the years<br/>before Schoenberg&apos;s invention of the twelve-tone technique fall into this<br/>category and the technique was largely conceived as a way of overcoming<br/>some of the perceived deficits of free atonal writing.  The microtonalist<br/>Haba used what he called a &apos;athematic&apos; technique, a very free form of<br/>atonality, with, in my opinion, some notable deficits in overall coherence.</p><p>Following the second Viennese School (Schoenberg, Berg, Webern) It is<br/>useful to distinguish between an American twelve-tone technique (i.e.<br/>Babbitt) and European serialism.  In retrospect and very broadly<br/>generalizing, Babbitt&apos;s technique gave priority to the idea of regulating<br/>the consumption of twelve-tone aggregates based upon a given intervallic<br/>set structure and then generalized the intervallic idea to other parameters<br/>so that the other parameters would cooperate with pitches to project the<br/>same underlying structure.  Across the pond, European composers generalized<br/>the concept of the series as applicable to the organization of the division<br/>of any continuum.  The notion of underlying interval structures common to<br/>the various parameters is not found here. To a certain extent, Europeans<br/>retained the idea of the series as a melody rather than as an abstract<br/>series of PCs or intervals.</p><p>I&apos;m giving a very condensed version here that ignores a lot of important<br/>figures (e.g.. Skryabin and the Skryabinists, Messiaen, Harrison, Carter,<br/>Cage) and ideas (e.g. the roles of logical positivism in the US and<br/>Magister Luci cum Marxian mysticism in Europe) but this is the general<br/>idea, and there is no reason (aside from inertia and the general atonal<br/>fatigue) why these techniques could not be adopted to gamuts other than<br/>12tet.  Ben Johnston used twelve tone set techniques in several works, John<br/>Cage/Lejaren Hiller&apos;s HPSCHD is a extravagant example of what could be<br/>called chance-driven serialism.  The just versions of La Monte Young&apos;s<br/>twelve tone _for Guitar_ and _Trio for strings_ are quite elegant.  One of<br/>Boulez&apos;s earliest works, written in the shadow of Wischnegradsky and later<br/>re-edited with microtones erased, used two intertwined twelve tone rows a<br/>quarter tone apart. Stockhausen has applied his brand of serial techniques<br/>to extremely microtonal woodwind scales in studies for his opera cycle,<br/>Nono applied his brand of serialism to the application of microtonal<br/>(apprx. quartertone) accidentals in several of his late works.  Some of the<br/>so-called complexity people work in this direction.</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/1999 6:00:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Didn&apos;t Ben Johnston use serial techniques in his microtonal<br/>compositions?</p><p>Sorry, don&apos;t know his work well enough.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d        B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3>bram &#x3C;bram@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/1999 2:15:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ok ...

It is virtually impossible to directly hear (especially<br/>for the non-specialist) all of the &quot;rules&quot; involved in common-practice<br/>counterpoint/harmony, and yet the application of that process creates a<br/>very compelling sort of musical effect -- full tertial harmonies,<br/>resolution of dissonances, independence of lines, and so on.</p><p>In such a case, as with most serialism, the purpose is to use musical<br/>processes to create such an overall musical effect, not to expect that the<br/>listener will be able to directly perceive every row transformation like<br/>some sort of theme and variations.</p><p>What effects is serialism suited for? Well, it is well suited to create<br/>atonal music because it enforces an equal distribution of the tones of the<br/>set, thus ensuring that no one receives special status through repetition.<br/>Serialism of other non-pitch parameters can similarly enforce an equal<br/>distribution of the set of possibilities, often resulting in irregular<br/>rhythm, inconsistent timbre, and so on.</p><p>Whether such a process results in music that you like is another question<br/>entirely, but I don&apos;t think you can blame processes that are not directly<br/>perceptible.
