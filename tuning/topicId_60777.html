I would love to hear your<br/>opinions on the subject too. Sorry that I am too lazy<br/>to edit the text! And, when I talk of the effect of<br/>someones mind, I mean like the effect of the actual<br/>positive or negative qualities held by their mind.<br/>Here it is:<br/>---</p><p>There is a subject which I am interested in, which I<br/>cannot often discuss wih people. I know it is not<br/>directly related to Tibetan software (though perhaps<br/>indirectly) so please forgive me if it is improper to<br/>post.<br/> Tony has said &quot;If your mind is afflicted then your<br/>action is afflicted.  It is misery and becomes the<br/>cause of further misery in the future.&quot; It is this<br/>which may not be accepted in most western circles. But<br/>I am more and more interested in the effect of the<br/>mind. I play music. When I play for someone, I bring<br/>them into contact with me. And I see an influence on<br/>them. My question has been, is it the MUSIC that<br/>effects them (if we can possibly conceive the music as<br/>a seperate entity, which seems false anyway!) or is<br/>the music simply a bridge from my mind to theirs, it<br/>being my mind which is now directly influencing<br/>theirs?<br/> So the question about mind would also be, is there an<br/>effect from the mind (or intention) of the composer<br/>which is embedded in the piece (eg the melody)? What<br/>has more effect, the mind of the composer, the mind of<br/>the performer, or the composition?<br/> This also relates to Tibetan software if you like -<br/>is the mind of the translator effecting people through<br/>the translation? Or even through software?<br/> The implication is that even an igeniously<br/>written/performed piece of music by a person with a<br/>negative mind, may have a negative effect, whereas<br/>even a musically bad piece by an enlightened being may<br/>be very beneficial to the listener. (Same applying for<br/>art, theatre etc).<br/> I would really like to hear what you think, as you<br/>may be of the few people I can ask who might hold a<br/>similar world-view in respect to &quot;mind&quot;.<br/> Best wishes<br/> Justin.</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>__________________________________<br/>Yahoo!
