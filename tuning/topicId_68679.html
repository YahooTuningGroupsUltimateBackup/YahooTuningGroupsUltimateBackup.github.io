Taking this in reverse, we can deduce that<br/>the chord of E major was &apos;usually&apos; tuned somewhat like ET; C major<br/>then probably being notably purer (regarding the thirds), and Ab major<br/>notably worse.<br/>Considering the usual inner workings of irregular temperaments, it<br/>also seems likely that both A major and F major were purer than ET<br/>triads... therefore C# major was likely to have been notably worse.</p><p>The biggest uncertainty is of course the degree of inequality. Given<br/>the popularity (in 18th century England) of tuning instructions which<br/>said effectively &apos;tune the thirds as sharp as the ear can bear and the<br/>fifths as flat as the ear can bear&apos; I think it unlikely that C major<br/>was any &apos;purer&apos; than in 1/5-comma meantone. Of course there are a lot<br/>of ways to gradate from that round to an ET-like E major...</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=68694 href="#68694">ðŸ”—</a>threesixesinarow &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/6/2007 6:13:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;threesixesinarow&quot; &lt;CACCOLA@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The Monthly Review, vol.lxx 01-06.1789, p147<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;To what do all these investigations tend?&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://books.google.com/books?http://books.google.com/books">http://books.google.com/books?http://books.google.com/books</a>?<br/>&gt; &gt; vid=OCLC40852044&amp;id=946NER8wVDYC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Clark<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cavallo is interesting not so much as a proponent of 12-ET, as for<br/>his<br/>&gt; interactions with the English musical establishment at so late a<br/>date<br/>&gt; (in this case the 1780s) and what this tells us about the &apos;usual<br/>&gt; manner&apos; of tuning for solo keyboard playing.</p><p>Cavallo has become associated with a music instrument manufacturer,<br/>David Wainwright quotes from Broadwood&apos;s records &quot;Carvalo&quot; bought &quot;a<br/>sett of jacks,&quot; and at least indirectly through Edward Whitaker Gray,<br/>but I noticed Wainwright seems to overemphasize Gray&apos;s role in a paper<br/>on light and acoustics read to the Royal Society in 1800, and the head<br/>clerk at Broadwood&apos;s Alfred Hipkins doesn&apos;t seem to cite anything.</p><p>Clark</p></div>
