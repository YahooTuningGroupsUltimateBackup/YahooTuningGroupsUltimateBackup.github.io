This &apos;C-E&apos; will be a remarkably close 2/7-comma meantone third<br/>C-E: now distribute this &apos;C-E&apos; into the 4 usual meantone fifths, C-G-D-A-E;<br/>the size of the fifth C-G will agree to 5 places after the decimal<br/>(~1.49468733 vs. the true value of ~1.49468550)! In fact, I think this<br/>technique might be *more* accurate than a monochord, because you are not<br/>dealing with the error of the fret placement--it&apos;s purely an acoustic<br/>relationship between beats...</p><p>To get 1/7-comma, take the resulting C-G, put a pure fifth G-D above it, and<br/>then readjust C-G so that G-D beats 1.5 times faster than C-G.<br/>This results in a 1/7-comma fifth.</p><p>Mathematically, you&apos;ve of course taken the square root of C-D&apos; (a major ninth)<br/>to get C-G...</p><p>Two other tricks:<br/>1/6-comma fifth= sqrt(1.5*(1/3 comma fifth))<br/>1/8-comma fifth = sqrt(1.5*(1/4 comma fifth))</p><p>Not satisfied with that, I found a way to get a very accurate 1/5-comma<br/>meantone fifth by ear...tune C-B as a pure 15/8. Temporarily tune C-G as a<br/>1/4-comma meantone fifth. Then make E sharp slightly so that E-B beats at<br/>exactly the same rate as C-G. This C-E is now a very accurate 1/5-comma<br/>meantone third. The &apos;C-E&apos; will then be divided into four fifths as any<br/>meantone, C-G-D-A-E, as above. The new C-G after this division will be an<br/>accurate 1/5-comma meantone fifth, again to five places after the decimal<br/>point (~1.49627528 vs ~1.49627787)!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/2005 11:30:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hey all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been busy investigating various ways to quickly approximate<br/>2/7-comma<br/>&gt; meantone temperament by ear without any monochord, audio aids, and<br/>beat rate<br/>&gt; charts, but purely with proportional beating guides.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I found a remarkably accurate relationship...</p><p>You can get very close to 2/7 comma by setting the beat ratio to be<br/>exactly -3/2.

Secondly, I am well aware of<br/>the synchronous beating properties of 2/7-comma. Thirdly, what I discovered<br/>was not those synchronous properties (duh, I knew about them already), but an<br/>accurate trick to find a 2/7-comma fifth without a monochord, so you could<br/>tune the puppy up without other audio aids. (Ditto my 1/5-comma trick, and<br/>yes, I know that 1/5-comma has great beat synchrony too, as does 1/7-comma,<br/>etc.)</p><p>Do you understand what I&apos;m saying here?</p><p>&gt; Gene<br/>&gt; should have said something about how the link he was pointing you to<br/>&gt; contained a more general statement of both your (re-) discovery and<br/>&gt; many other related facts.</p><p>Like I said, it&apos;s not a re-discovery, but a genuine discovery of a tuning<br/>bearing-plan trick.
