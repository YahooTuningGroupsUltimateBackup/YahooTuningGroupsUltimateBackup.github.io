My method here was to tune the &apos;roots&apos; of the<br/>&gt;chords to small-integer JI, then to tune other notes<br/>&gt;with commatic substitutions of small-integer JI wherever<br/>&gt;small-integer JI didn&apos;t sound right to me, and where<br/>&gt;I imagined Beethoven might want those commatic substitutions<br/>&gt;for harmonic or melodic reasons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So is that extended reference or not?</p><p>Extended reference is not rigorously defined, by me, Boomsliter &amp; Creel, or<br/>anyone else.  It&apos;s just a term for something B. &amp; C. observed.  My<br/>definition trys to put their observation in terms of what&apos;s been discussed<br/>here over the last few years.  Let&apos;s walk through it.</p><p>Say we agree that JI is important in melody.  How should we apply JI in the<br/>following example?</p><p>C D E D E F</p><p>The classical JI school would say [subscribers to this school please<br/>forgive the color that follows], &quot;The diatonic scale, eh?  What intervals<br/>does that involve?&quot;  They write...</p><p>1:1  9:8  5:4  4:3  3:2  5:3  15:8</p><p>Then they say, &quot;C is the tonic of the above melody!&quot; and write...</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8<br/>C   D   E   F   G   A   B</p><p>...and finally...</p><p>1/1  9/8  5/4  9/8  5/4  4/3</p><p>The extended reference version is more like, &quot;Diatonic music, eh?  What<br/>basic set of intervals do we need?&quot;</p><p>1:1  16:15  9:8  6:5  5:4  4:3  7:5  3:2  8:5  5:3  9:5  15:8</p><p>&quot;Now, what&apos;s happening in our melody?  The first note is always 1/1...&quot;</p><p>1/1<br/>C</p><p>&quot;Let&apos;s make the 2nd above C a 9:8...&quot;</p><p>1/1 9/8<br/>C   D</p><p>&quot;And a cracking-good 3rd is 5:4...&quot;</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4<br/>C   D   E</p><p>&quot;And we see that the scale degree pattern 1 2 3 is now being repeated on D<br/>[modal transposition].  So D is our new tonic, and the first note is always<br/>a 1:1 [D stays 9/8].  Let&apos;s make the 2nd above D a 9:8.  That gives...&quot;</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4 9/8 81/64<br/>C   D   E   D   E</p><p>&quot;And the third above D should be a 6:5...&quot;</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4 9/8 81/64 27/20<br/>C   D   E   D   E     F</p><p>There you have it.  I&apos;ve used the convention developed on this list -- /&apos;s<br/>for pitches, and :&apos;s for intervals.  Notice the main difference between the<br/>classical JI school and the extended reference school is where the modal<br/>transposition takes place -- on the pitches vs. on the intervals.</p><p>[It&apos;s important not to hang up on the details of my example.  The &quot;basic<br/>set&quot; actually chosen by the extended reference tuner, the particular just<br/>&quot;diatonic&quot; scale chosen by the classical tuner, and the choice of tonics by<br/>both parties may be entirely different than what I&apos;ve given.  The methods<br/>themselves have nothing to say about these choices.]</p><p>So now maybe you can answer the question.  I would guess that if you were<br/>successful, the Robert Johnson transcription would be extended reference if<br/>the performance was.  The Beethovan?</p><p>[P.S.  You can take out the &quot;&lt;--insert references...--&gt;&quot; part of my<br/>definition.  Thanks for inserting the references!!]</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=8117 href="#8117">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@nni.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2000 7:30:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;With the Beethoven fragment, I was consciously *not*<br/>&gt;&gt;seeking small-number ratios in many cases, which upon<br/>&gt;&gt;reflection seems to contradict the extended-reference<br/>&gt;&gt;idea.

See<br/>TD 502.7.</p><p>Raises the question if intent or content should determine extended<br/>reference.  One problem with content: If the basic set never leaves the<br/>diamond of a certain scale, and you allow rapid tonic changes on the<br/>current frequencies (not just the original ones), you can notate any<br/>extended ref. interp. in classic JI using that scale.  So should we define<br/>classic JI as allowing modulation only on the original frequencies?  Or<br/>should we make a subjective judgement as to which notation is more concise<br/>in a given case?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
