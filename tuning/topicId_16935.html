I&apos;m meeting lot&apos;s of great people in<br/>this group and hopefully can find time to respond to everyone in a<br/>timely fashion. Exploring different tunings and understanding what<br/>each sounds like and what I can do with them sounds like &quot;EXACTLY&quot;<br/>where I want to be. What books or web sites do you recommend that<br/>will get me started in understanding the whole concept. I&apos;ve been<br/>to MANY web sites and at times am &quot;saturated&quot; in wonderful info.<br/>I&apos;ll get my questions together and ask them to all of my new<br/>friends on this tuning group. Friends I met so far are Paul, David.<br/>and Neil.</p><p>Thanks so much</p><p>Wally</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;    Hey Wally...I have been playing guitar for 35 years now, starting<br/>&gt; with 12 eq.
