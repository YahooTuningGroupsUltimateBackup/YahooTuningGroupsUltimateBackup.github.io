I<br/>was interested in the microtonalisms outside of the placement of sa re ga ma<br/>pa dha ni .</p><p>As I remember, he felt a bit sideswiped by me.  LaMonte Young and Marian<br/>Zazeela were in on the sessions, sometimes droning, and playing tamboura.<br/>Pran Nath thought he would start a semi-beginner, expecting to have to drill<br/>me on matching new pitches and remembering there names and placements.  At<br/>one point he turned to LaMonte in what seemed an angered way.  &quot;Why did you<br/>not tell me he was a musician?&quot;  So I sort of took the opportunity to write<br/>down this list of gamukas with his explanation and demonstrations (which I<br/>had to reproduce).</p><p>meend - sliding</p><p>soot (ooh sound) -- falling off at end</p><p>andolin -- swing (very slight)</p><p>gaseed -- sliding pond down</p><p>kutka -- sa, sa, sa (only 3 times or less)</p><p>houlik -- upwards glide</p><p>gitkree -- glottal</p><p>dhuran -- ascending slide</p><p>muran -- upper note/descending</p><p>layhuk -- snakelike/descending</p><p>consure -- part of other note, regarding its pitch</p><p>murki -- downward mordent</p><p>tan -- quick or medium putters through</p><p>It was a long time ago.  best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
