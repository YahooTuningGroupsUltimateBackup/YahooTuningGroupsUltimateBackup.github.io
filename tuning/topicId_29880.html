Not only is<br/>it lovely music, possibly made even lovelier, but the act of working<br/>with 12-tET works such as this torques off people who are intolerant of<br/>touching past masters, and believe me, these are people who seriously<br/>_need_ to be torqued off! ;-&gt;</p><p>So here&apos;s Debussy&apos;s Estampes #3, (Jardins sous la pluie), sequenced by<br/>Jeruen E. Dery.  I&apos;ve included the original 12-tET, 5-limit &quot;tuning file<br/>free&quot;, and 7-limit.  Also, because I find the dynamic range of the<br/>sequence excessive on my sound card, I have included the same three<br/>versions with slightly less dynamic range.</p><p>If you have an adventuresome spirit, and aren&apos;t frightened by those who<br/>would glare at you when you listen to &quot;unapproved&quot; and &quot;inappropriate&quot;<br/>treatments, I recommend starting with debest03vcs7.  If that&apos;s too much,<br/>try debest03ves3 (the 5-limit volume flattened version), and if that&apos;s<br/>_still_ too much, you can go 12-tET, as originally sequenced.</p><p>I put this in a zip file on my web page:</p><p>   <a href="http://www.adaptune.com">http://www.adaptune.com</a></p><p>(change to Studio J; it&apos;s near the top of the page).</p><p>Requires a sound card or module capable of rendering General MIDI.<br/>Enjoy!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=29887 href="#29887">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2001 7:55:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you have an adventuresome spirit, and aren&apos;t frightened by those<br/>who<br/>&gt; would glare at you when you listen to &quot;unapproved&quot;<br/>and &quot;inappropriate&quot;<br/>&gt; treatments, I recommend starting with debest03vcs7.</p><p>_I_ certainly wouldn&apos;t label the 7-limit tuning &quot;inappropriate&quot;.

BTW, Herman Miller has written me<br/>off-list to say that the sequence has some fairly serious errors in<br/>it, which I wasn&apos;t aware of.
