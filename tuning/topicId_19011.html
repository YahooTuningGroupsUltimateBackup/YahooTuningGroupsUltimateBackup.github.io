Unfortunately, I&apos;m only really interested<br/>if there&apos;s a plausibility in 7-limit as well, and there the ambiguity<br/>of 7:6 and 8:7 means that springs can&apos;t reasonably be &quot;blindly&quot;<br/>targeted.  Thus, for 19-tET in 7-limit, my tuning file method or some<br/>good substitute is required.  That&apos;s more work than the blind method.</p><p>And what of the second question?  Pitch bends?
