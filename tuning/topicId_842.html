His stuff isn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;earth-shattering, but I do find it sensitive and tasteful, and he&apos;s a<br/>&gt;&gt;far better pianist than Riley, whose piano stuff may be important from<br/>a<br/>&gt;&gt;tuning point of view, but not as far as what he plays, IMO, judging<br/>&gt;&gt;from Harp of New Albion, which is a cheap bunch of runs.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;Keith&apos;s modest liner notes from &quot;Vienna Concert&quot;:</p><p>&gt;&quot;I have courted the fire for a very long time, and many sparks have<br/>flown<br/>&gt;in the past, but the music on this recording speaks, finally, the<br/>language<br/>&gt;of the flame itself.&quot;</p><p>&gt;I rest my case. :-)</p><p>I see nothing egotistical in that quote. It is the statement of an<br/>artist&apos;s lifelong personal struggle to capture a burning creative<br/>inspiration.</p><p>Dante, have you tried writing to Mark Rankin at either of the addresses<br/>posted so far? If not, I volunteer to write him for both of us.</p></div><h3><a id=1130 href="#1130">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The closer it is, and the lower the odd limit of the ratio<br/>it&apos;s<br/>&gt;near to, the harder it is to hear it &quot;as itself&quot;</p><p>Yes, that&apos;s exactly what&apos;s implied by the quantitative theory I adapted<br/>from Van Eck and use for determining &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;. I posted the<br/>quantitative details of the former a long time ago, and all my postings<br/>on the latter are collected at<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/entropy.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/entropy.htm</a>. Basically it confirms<br/>Harry Partch&apos;s Observation One, that the &quot;field of attraction&quot; (measured<br/>in logarithmic units) of a simple ratio is inversely proportional to the<br/>interval&apos;s odd limit.</p><p>&gt;Rather than trying to gain an advantage (this is not a competition) any<br/>&gt;changing of terms or inconsistancies on my part are simply the result<br/>of my<br/>&gt;trying to get a handle on issues that are somewhat new to me. I can<br/>only<br/>&gt;ask for your patience and try to formulate my thoughts more carefully<br/>in<br/>&gt;future.</p><p>Certainly -- and I am not immune to the same phenomenon, but I have<br/>thought deeply about these issues for many years. My apologies again if<br/>I got crabby.</p></div>
