What is the fundamental frequency,<br/>&gt;&gt; according to your FFT? And according to your ear? Do they agree?<br/>What I&apos;m<br/>&gt;&gt; guessing it that you&apos;re using a fundamental frequency corresponding<br/>to the<br/>&gt;&gt; period of your entire sample, which would of course be a subsonic<br/>frequency,<br/>&gt;&gt; and all the other frequencies are necessarily (by the design of<br/>FFT) integer<br/>&gt;&gt; multiples of that frequency. Could this be your error?</p><p>Jacky wrote,</p><p>&gt;Paul,</p><p>&gt;Hello.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m not convinced that it is in error. The reason being is that the<br/>&gt;frequencies that I used to construct the scale were from 27-30 of the<br/>&gt;highest amplitude - and correct me if I&apos;m wrong, these certainly<br/>&gt;*could* have been the found in such a sample as the prominent<br/>&gt;frequencies. It was the other 500 that I didn&apos;t use (of lesser<br/>&gt;amplitude), that we haven&apos;t (yet) considered.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t matter. You need to answer the question -- is your fundamental<br/>frequency simply the lowest spectral line from your FFT? If it is, you will<br/>only ever get an exact harmonic series as your spectrum, which is of course<br/>useless if what you&apos;re trying to do is a Sethares-typ matching of tuning to<br/>timbre.</p><p>&gt;One other thing that makes me believe that it&apos;s either correct, or<br/>&gt;else, very close, is that the tuning *sounds* correct with the music.</p><p>You&apos;ve got an otonal series as your tuning -- as Carl has discussed, this<br/>will, in a way, &quot;sound correct&quot; with _any_ timbre with any fixed spectrum.<br/>The reason is that the virtual pitch and combination tone processes will<br/>yield psychologically far more coherent results when sets of partials can be<br/>grouped into exact harmonic (i.e., otonal) series.</p></div><h3><a id=15773 href="#15773">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>11/22/2000 2:16:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.
