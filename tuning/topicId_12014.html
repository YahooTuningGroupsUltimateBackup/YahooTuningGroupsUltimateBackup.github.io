By the<br/>way, as a very experienced guitarist, let me assure you all that G&amp;Ls are<br/>extremely fine instruments, easily outclassing Fenders in the same price<br/>range. I recently switched my main (12-tET) guitar from a Les Paul Custom to<br/>a G&amp;L S-500, and though I miss the vocal lead and jazz tones of the Custom,<br/>the G&amp;L gives me great funk and country tones, has the wider string spacing<br/>that my picking hand prefers, and is a blessing to the pinched nerve in my<br/>left shoulder which didn&apos;t appreciate the 10-ton Custom hanging from it on a<br/>strap . . .</p></div>
