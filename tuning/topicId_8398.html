The first verse is scored for<br/>oboe, bass clarinet, cello, and guitar quartet (two electric&apos;s, and<br/>two steel string acoustics). The piece is also what I&apos;ll call a<br/>polytonal modal composite, where the electric guitars take C as the<br/>1/1, while the oboe, bass clarinet, and acoustic guitars take F (4/3)<br/>as the 1/1, and the cello takes D (9/8) as the 1/1. So as the basic<br/>step structure of the electric guitars is 10/9, 21/20, 9/8, 8/7,<br/>28/27, 9/8, 8/7, i.e., LsLLsLL:</p><p>1/1, 10/9, 7/6, 21/16, 3/2, 14/9, 7/4, 2/1</p><p>While the step structure of the oboe, bass clarinet, and acoustic<br/>guitars is sLLLsLL:</p><p>1/1, 28/27, 7/6, 4/3, 40/27, 14/9, 7/4, 2/1</p><p>And the step structure of the cello is LLsLLsL:</p><p>63/32, 9/8, 5/4, 21/16, 189/128, 27/16, 7/4, 63/32</p><p>Which results in a VI, III, V modal composite.

As I better<br/>understand what your doing now Dave, I&apos;ll just try some of these<br/>myself when I get a chance. Usually I would say that most of these<br/>microtempering differences would probably just be lost in the ebb and<br/>flow of naturally occurring errors - by that I&apos;m meaning both<br/>unintended tuning errors in performance and whatnot, and sensitive,<br/>and variable intonation adjustments made by non-fixed pitch<br/>instruments (I also think that these sensitive and intended micro<br/>adjustments of pitch are sometimes adumbrated, or hinted at, by the<br/>dynamics and attacks and placements of certain notes by fixed pitch<br/>instruments as well). However my recollection of this piece was that<br/>certain intervals were very sensitive to slight tuning alterations, so<br/>microtempering seems just the thing to try.</p><p>&gt;By the way Dan, I must commend you on the enormous strides you&apos;ve<br/>made in learning and using standard ASCII math notation since we first<br/>e-met.</p><p>Well as I&apos;ve said before, though I don&apos;t have much of a desire to iron<br/>out every single wrinkle and quirk of the way I was used to going<br/>about things, I very much DO appreciate what I&apos;ve been able to learn,<br/>better understand, and perhaps better present, from the time I&apos;ve<br/>spent this previous year at the TD. I got the computer and all that<br/>goes with it (electronic tuning forums, standard ASCII math notation,<br/>etc., etc,) all at once last year, and it was all completely uncharted<br/>territory for me. So I had to get my feet wet in a bunch of different<br/>(and usually embarrassing!) ways all at once.</p><p>&gt;The only oversight I noticed recently (and I&apos;m a bloody-minded<br/>pedant) was something like &quot;6/17&quot; where you apparently meant six<br/>seventeenths of an octave (I don&apos;t remember the actual example).

I guess I&apos;ve just never had much of a problem understanding that<br/>when the numerator is less than the denominator here, chances are<br/>pretty fair that it&apos;s going to mean a fraction of an octave. But I<br/>also do understand the desire for a more sound or precise<br/>nomenclature... so I&apos;ll think it over again.</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=8443 href="#8443">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@capecod.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2000 1:22:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Graham Breed:]<br/>&gt; Aha!

The fact that Dave Keenan got the right numbers to two decimal<br/>places means he must have derived the same scale.  The fact that<br/>everything is determined by the fifth means that it isn&apos;t a<br/>microtemperament.  Or does it?  I don&apos;t find a definiiton in Monzo&apos;s<br/>dictionary.  Here&apos;s an attempt.</p><p>A temperament where each just interval approximates to a single tempered<br/>interval, and more than two intervals (including the octave) are required<br/>to define the tuning.</p><p>If a just interval approximates to different tempered intervals, you have<br/>a well temperament.</p><p>If only two intervals, usually an octave and a fifth, are required to<br/>define the tuning, you have a linear temperament.  Examples are meantone<br/>and schismic scales.</p><p>Kudos to Dave Keenan for blazing this trail.</p><p>For an octave-invariant scale, the number of bridge intervals for a<br/>microtemperament is two less than the number of harmonic axes.  For<br/>7-prime limit, there are 3 harmonic axes: 3, 5 and 7.  So only 1 bridge is<br/>required for a microtemperament.  Two bridges therefore must give you a<br/>linear temperament, as indeed they do here.</p><p>I also disagree with Monzo&apos;s definition of temperament: &quot;a tuning which is<br/>/not/ a just-intonation; that is, the intervals are /not/ small-integer<br/>ratios&quot;.  I would prefer &quot;a tuning which /approximates/ just-intonation;<br/>that is, the intervals are /close to/ small-integer ratios, and the scale<br/>is somehow simplified relative to its just equivalent&quot;.  Some tunings make<br/>no attempt to approximate JI, and so should not be considered<br/>temperaments.</p></div><h3><a id=8543 href="#8543">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
