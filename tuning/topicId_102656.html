Depending on which one we decide is correct, we will end up with a different hierarchy of consonance and dissonance, as well as a different model of the &quot;fields of attraction&quot;.  We don&apos;t currently have sufficient evidence to single any one of these curves out as the universally-correct one, and some of them are wildly at variance with the others.  There are free variables within the theory of HE, including s, octave equivalence, type of probability distribution, weighting method, and type of seed series.  There are points they all share in common, such as 3/2 being the most concordant interval between 1/1 and 2/1 or 81/64 failing to be a local minimum.  However, in for instance the last curve, we do in fact see 15/14 emerge as a local minimum, whereas in others we might not even see 11/7 emerge as a local minimum.  As regards the consonance or attractiveness of the ratios of 11 to maybe 19 or 21, the jury is still out--especially for intervals wider than a 2/1.  I don&apos;t have a horse in the race (anymore) and I&apos;m content to allow there to be debate and ambiguity.  Paul has suggested to me on numerous occasions that s is *necessarily* a free parameter, as it varies from subject to subject.

Because you seem to think there is no ambiguity about the absolute dissonance of dyads of the 11-limit and up, despite a lack of sufficient evidence to convince, well, anyone.  I&apos;m quite sure you&apos;re the only person here who considers the matter settled.  Even Paul was flabbergasted at your insistence that a Tenney Height above 70 was an automatic disqualifier for consonance (he puts the Tenney Height at *least* around 100, FWIW, and has noted in himself the ability to tune up to a 17/13 by eliminating beats).</p><p>&gt; &gt; In any case, I hope you understand where I&apos;m coming from,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I do - I think you like disbelieving things.</p><p>It&apos;s true.  Like most philosophers, I try like hell to disprove as many of my beliefs as I have the resources to disprove, and only an overwhelming failure to succeed at this disproof is sufficient grounds to let the belief stand.  In recent times, you&apos;ve given me evidence to reject my previous beliefs on nuclear power, the economy, the NDAA, and many things espoused by the Occupy movement, and I have immediately modified my beliefs in accordance with the compelling evidence or arguments you presented.  My love of discordant EDOs emerged from a similar test of my (previously-held) belief that only maximally-consonant tunings are worth composing with.  I still have some correspondence between Paul and me where *he* was trying to convince *me* that 720 cents could work as an approximate 3/2.  At the time I refused to even call 720 cents a &quot;fifth&quot;.</p><p>In the case of the question of consonance and fields of attraction, I think your usual ability to produce robust and convincing evidence (which tends to obviate any debate) has come up very short, again and again and again, yet your conviction never wavers.  The fact that the vast majority of people in this community are also not convinced by you, and that this &quot;debate&quot; comes up again and again, should give you pause about either a) the evidence for your beliefs or b) your ability to articulate your beliefs and your evidence for them.  I won&apos;t say you&apos;re wrong, just that you haven&apos;t given me enough reason to agree with you.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Compare these images:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The all show both features I mentioned: that for simple<br/>&gt; ratios, fields of attraction are wider and dissonance<br/>&gt; increases more rapidly per cent of detuning -- features<br/>&gt; also described by Werckmeister and Partch.</p><p>And I acknowledged this.  But the question of how wide the fields of attraction are, which ratios have them, and how fast the dissonance increases with detuning, are decidedly not answered.  Some of the Vos-curve models show fields of attraction for intervals up to 21/11, for instance.  Of course they are not deep or wide, and of course the 5-limit is mostly more concordant than the 7-limit, which is mostly more concordant than the 9-limit, which is mostly more concordant than the 11-limit (etc.).</p><p>If the goal of weighting is to reflect discordance, I don&apos;t see how one single weighting algorithm (Tenney weighting) can accurately reflect all of the possible discordance curves.

I want to assume as<br/>&gt;&gt; little as possible. Fields of attraction are debatable.<br/>&gt;&gt; Consonance and dissonance are debatable. There are about a<br/>&gt;&gt; dozen HE curves that I&apos;ve seen, with none of them being<br/>&gt;&gt; clearly universally-superior and several of them conflicting<br/>&gt;&gt; with each other. See the XA facebook group photos section.<br/>&gt;&gt; However, the absolute distance of a tempered interval from<br/>&gt;&gt; a rational interval is not debatable. I want to measure how<br/>&gt;&gt; close each ET gets to the various subgroup tonality diamonds,<br/>&gt;&gt; and then other people can debate what those measurements<br/>&gt;&gt; mean as far as consonance/dissonance and intervallic<br/>&gt;&gt; identities.  This way if someone asks &quot;which subgroup is most<br/>&gt;&gt; accurately represented in 15-TET?&quot;, I can say &quot;2.a.b.c.d&quot; and<br/>&gt;&gt; not have to worry about what the weighting did or did not do<br/>&gt;&gt; to the error calculations.</p><p>I guess really don&apos;t know how to parse this, and maybe I<br/>jumped to a conclusion.

Pretty much everybody<br/>uses weighted error these days, so it seems like it ought to<br/>be less debatable than unweighted error.</p><p>I also don&apos;t know what a subgroup tonality diamond is.  But<br/>I think what you&apos;re calling a subgroup is actually the basis<br/>of a subgroup, and you want the tonality diamond formed by<br/>the basis elements.  If so you may be thinking of the bases<br/>as chords, which is what I tried to bring up before: if you&apos;re<br/>interested in chords, measure the error of chords and don&apos;t<br/>worry about subgroups.

People who tend to compose in JI will probably go on and learn<br/>to identify/categorize a lot of JI intervals, beyond the threshold<br/>where psychoacoustic concordance ends.

But I can think of cases where someone seeking to apply Partch&apos;s principle (that complex intervals need to be tuned more accurately) would find Tenney weighting ass-backwards for their purposes.  *You* might want to argue with them about the merits of Tenney weighting or the spuriousness of Partch&apos;s principle; I don&apos;t want to argue with them, and would rather just be able to say &quot;okay, you don&apos;t like the weighting?  Well, here&apos;s the unweighted error, make of it what you will.&quot;  This is something Paul does a lot on XA--&quot;you don&apos;t think this HE curve adequately represents your experience of consonance?  Here, look at this other one, it&apos;s got a lower s (or a different probability distribution, etc.).&quot;  I&apos;d prefer a variety of things to look at and offer people.  That is all!</p><p>Of course unweighted error is debatable (you can debate whether it accurately reflects how consonant the intervals are, or how accurately it reflects the integrity of intervallic identity), but it makes the fewest assumptions about what error *should* reflect.  It&apos;s also the &quot;raw&quot; information, which can be manipulated further more easily than any weighted forms.</p><p>&gt; Pretty much everybody<br/>&gt; uses weighted error these days, so it seems like it ought to<br/>&gt; be less debatable than unweighted error.</p><p>It would be less *debated*, among this group which has reached a consensus, but no less *debatable*, as those outside the group may find issue with it.  And for the record, I&apos;m not saying we shouldn&apos;t look at weighted error as well.  I just want the option to look at unweighted error, in the event that I may someday be confronted with someone who wants to debate the weighting methods we use.</p><p>&gt; I also don&apos;t know what a subgroup tonality diamond is.  But<br/>&gt; I think what you&apos;re calling a subgroup is actually the basis<br/>&gt; of a subgroup, and you want the tonality diamond formed by<br/>&gt; the basis elements.</p><p>Yeah, you&apos;ve got it.</p><p>&gt; If so you may be thinking of the bases<br/>&gt; as chords, which is what I tried to bring up before: if you&apos;re<br/>&gt; interested in chords, measure the error of chords and don&apos;t<br/>&gt; worry about subgroups.  Subgroups are for when you aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; targeting a particular chord.</p><p>Okay.  I think I need an alternative word to &quot;subgroup&quot;.  Maybe &quot;subset&quot;?  I mean, the chords I&apos;m looking at are subsets of the 15-limit, and the dyadic intervals formed between basis elements of the chords form a subset of the 15-limit tonality diamond.  Does that make sense?</p><p>Now I&apos;m going to write a post about Tenney weighting, because I have some questions that I want clarified.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=102890 href="#102890">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2012 10:16:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Cameron can clarify, but what he meant seems pretty<br/>&gt; straightforward.

That&apos;s why I said &quot;outside<br/>of laboratory conditions&quot; in the parent post.  And it&apos;s<br/>ironic that Paul is the counterparty, since he was the most<br/>vigorous and successful attacker of rational intonation<br/>dogma probably in all of history.  One of the first threads<br/>I joined on this list consisted of Paul and I arguing over<br/>whether there was a significant difference in the beating<br/>patterns of 300 cents and 19/16 (Mills Digest 1217).</p><p>In any case the entire situation is bizarre, since I was<br/>only agreeing with your statement that &apos;some people say the<br/>identity of complex ratios is more quickly lost through<br/>detuning&apos;.  Another way to say that is that the fields of<br/>attraction are smaller.  So I was just agreeing.  But I also<br/>pointed out that musical context helps with identification,<br/>and that discordance increase per cent detuning is also<br/>relevant, and that almost everyone since Werckmeister agrees<br/>that 2:1 should bear less error than 6:5 if possible, and<br/>hence almost all RMP work is done using weighted error.</p><p>&gt; What I don&apos;t understand is why consonance and dissonance are<br/>&gt; necessarily inherent in error measures.</p><p>Error is only defined this way, full stop.</p><p>&gt; I know why we, in this group, build consonance into our error<br/>&gt; metrics--because we are interested in consonance.</p><p>A thousand times no.

Is that what<br/>you think, or not?</p><p>&gt; *You* might want to argue</p><p>What *I* want is completely immaterial.</p><p>&gt; This is something Paul does a lot on XA--&quot;you don&apos;t think this<br/>&gt; HE curve adequately represents your experience of consonance?<br/>&gt; Here, look at this other one, it&apos;s got a lower s (or a different<br/>&gt; probability distribution, etc.).&quot;</p><p>All HE curves (or nearly all) have the features that we are<br/>talking about in this thread, which pertain to your ET<br/>profiling project.  Paul is fitting curves to people&apos;s<br/>stated preferences; an activity I consider to be largely a<br/>waste of time at this point.  But it&apos;s also relatively safe<br/>because the underlying model is incredibly simple.  In no<br/>way does it cast doubt on our ability to measure error and<br/>optimize tunings for temperaments.</p><p>&gt; Of course unweighted error ... makes the fewest assumptions<br/>&gt; about what error *should* reflect.</p><p>No, that&apos;s not true!

Another way to say that is that the fields of<br/>&gt; attraction are smaller.  So I was just agreeing.  But I also<br/>&gt; pointed out that musical context helps with identification,<br/>&gt; and that discordance increase per cent detuning is also<br/>&gt; relevant, and that almost everyone since Werckmeister agrees<br/>&gt; that 2:1 should bear less error than 6:5 if possible, and<br/>&gt; hence almost all RMP work is done using weighted error.</p><p>The only claim I made involves other peoples&apos; beliefs.  I personally am agnostic as regards &quot;fields of attraction&quot;, but that&apos;s moot in this discussion.  In any case, why is it impossible to look at error from the perspective of fields of attraction, rather than consonance?  Size of field of attraction is inversely proportional to consonance, suggesting that the exact opposite weighting should be used.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What I don&apos;t understand is why consonance and dissonance are<br/>&gt; &gt; necessarily inherent in error measures.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Error is only defined this way, full stop.</p><p>Explain.  I understand error to be difference between a tempered interval and a rational interval; nothing in my understanding requires any definition of consonance or dissonance.  It&apos;s just a difference between two numbers.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I know why we, in this group, build consonance into our error<br/>&gt; &gt; metrics--because we are interested in consonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A thousand times no.  We do not build consonance into error<br/>&gt; metrics.  We build error metrics to measure consonance.</p><p>What&apos;s the difference?  And why can&apos;t error metrics be used for other purposes?</p><p>&gt; &gt; But I can think of cases where someone seeking to apply<br/>&gt; &gt; Partch&apos;s principle (that complex intervals need to be tuned<br/>&gt; &gt; more accurately) would find Tenney weighting ass-backwards<br/>&gt; &gt; for their purposes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 21/16 should be tuned as accurately as 2/1?  Is that what<br/>&gt; you think, or not?</p><p>*I* don&apos;t think anything.  But I want to allow for a multitude of interpretations.  Some people might think a fudged 2/1 is more sensible than a fudged 21/16.  I don&apos;t begrudge them that.  I can see, for instance, how 1215 cents still sounds like a 2/1 in a way that 485 cents no longer sounds like a 21/16, even if the former loses more consonance in the mistuning than the latter.  I can also see some sense in the idea that simple ratios have *more* to lose, and going by the HE graphs it looks like a 3/2 can be mistuned *a lot* before it becomes as discordant as a pure 13/8 (for instance)...so it&apos;s sort of a &quot;rob a rich man, or rob a poor man&quot; kind of question--the rich man has more to lose, but can also bear a small loss more easily than the poor man.  But like I said, I don&apos;t have a conviction either way.</p><p>&gt; &gt; *You* might want to argue<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What *I* want is completely immaterial.</p><p>Coulda fooled me!</p><p>&gt; All HE curves (or nearly all) have the features that we are<br/>&gt; talking about in this thread, which pertain to your ET<br/>&gt; profiling project.  Paul is fitting curves to people&apos;s<br/>&gt; stated preferences; an activity I consider to be largely a<br/>&gt; waste of time at this point.  But it&apos;s also relatively safe<br/>&gt; because the underlying model is incredibly simple.  In no<br/>&gt; way does it cast doubt on our ability to measure error and<br/>&gt; optimize tunings for temperaments.</p><p>What about the Farey series HE curve, with a downward overall slope?  You seem to be avoiding responding to that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Of course unweighted error ... makes the fewest assumptions<br/>&gt; &gt; about what error *should* reflect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, that&apos;s not true!  It makes just as many assumptions,<br/>&gt; and, in the context of extrapolating error from a basis,<br/>&gt; makes worse ones.</p><p>Clearly I am missing something.  How does unweighted error make any assumptions?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I just want the option to look at unweighted error,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How many times have I told you it will be there?</p><p>Then why are you arguing with me about it?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Okay.

Some people report similar experiences even with 5/4 and 400 cents. Kind of like how I&apos;m so used to the sound of 400 cents that I can usually tune my B string 400 cents above the open G in 12-TET by finding that just-right texture by ear, since I&apos;ve done it so damn many times.  462 and 553 cents between the strings of my 13-ED2 guitar are getting there, too.  Am I homing in on 17/13 and 11/8?  I doubt it, unless I have the gain jacked up enough to hear the combination tones lock in.  I think I&apos;ve just familiarized myself enough with the character of those intervals that I can recognize them by ear.  Meaning they now have fields of attraction for me.

They can&apos;t tell that the unison (or octave, or fifth, or whatever) is out-of-tune, and just blithely plow onward.  I can think of hundreds of real-world cases where people have demonstrated this, and I&apos;m sure you can too.

But, for the sake of argument,<br/>let&apos;s say there are things that Western tonality has that other styles<br/>of music don&apos;t have, and these things are rather agreeable to most<br/>people.</p><p>I still doubt that concordance is the most important part of Western<br/>tonality. There&apos;s a million other things that we haven&apos;t even fully<br/>explored. There&apos;s this huge, overarching logical structure of how<br/>intervals are laid out, connect with one another, &quot;resolve&quot; to one<br/>another, combine with one another, form scales, are arranged in order<br/>with respect to one another, are habitually used in an unspoken<br/>logical/musical context with one another, etc.</p><p>The Bach retunings preserve almost all of those things except for the<br/>concordance, and although concordant tunings add a sweetness to the<br/>whole thing which only adds to the enjoyment of it all (at least in<br/>this case), the other things do more to establish the effect of<br/>&quot;tonality&quot; more than the concordance does. You can claim that<br/>eliminating the concordance makes it suck, but there&apos;s a lot of us who<br/>don&apos;t share that value judgment. And these are things I don&apos;t think we<br/>know much about.</p><p>What I do know is that this &quot;background logical structure&quot; I talked<br/>about, which is fundamental to western tonality, means a lot. It means<br/>that when you play two part inventions, you get the sensation of<br/>triadic harmony, complete with corresponding western emotions, whether<br/>or not you ever end up playing three notes at the same time. It means<br/>that you constantly have some kind of background &quot;key&quot; or &quot;scale&quot; or<br/>&quot;mode&quot; or whatever in your mind, typically something like the major or<br/>minor scale, which you change in small doses as new notes are added.<br/>It means that certain chords which are extremely concordant, like<br/>4:5:6:7, can be suddenly very dissonant, like in German sixth chords.<br/>It means that if you warp the hell out of the diatonic structure so<br/>that the augmented fourths are closer to 3/2 than the perfect fifths,<br/>the augmented fourths will sound like tritones that&apos;d be nice if they<br/>resolved. None of this necessarily has anything to do with concordance<br/>at all, although concordance can be used as a tool to augment<br/>different aspects of this structure.</p><p>And the more you start playing in different tunings, the more at least<br/>some people start building similar background logical structures for<br/>that tuning, and actual concordance matters less and less; sooner or<br/>later 11/8 now sounds like it&apos;s implying 8:9:10:11:12 and at this<br/>point I have to take 4 tabs of LSD and go on a guided Zen meditation<br/>to become aware of all of the stuff I&apos;m filtering out and projecting<br/>onto the sound.</p><p>That&apos;s my experience, anyway.

Western music was the<br/>&gt; xenharmonic music of its day, having 12 rather than 7 or 5<br/>&gt; notes, 5-limit harmony, and meantone (and later diminished,<br/>&gt; augmented, and dominant) comma pumps.</p><p>No question, our Western forebears really figured out how to milk the reward-centers in our brains via technological and social innovation.

And has *evolved* to do so with greater and greater efficiency, leading to modern top-40 radio, and especially techno music.  Simpler and simpler forms, slicker and slicker presentation.  A single person can now wield all the grandiosity of an orchestra.

Banking was another -- Westerners had robust<br/>&gt; &gt; property rights and contract law, abstract (trust-based)<br/>&gt; &gt; media of exchange, and quantification of the time value of<br/>&gt; &gt; money (interest).  Western languages had larger vocabularies<br/>&gt; &gt; and could be exchanged through reading, writing, and<br/>&gt; &gt; printing (Western scholars developed phonetic systems for<br/>&gt; &gt; many indigenous languages).  Western music was the<br/>&gt; &gt; xenharmonic music of its day, having 12 rather than 7 or 5<br/>&gt; &gt; notes, 5-limit harmony, and meantone (and later diminished,<br/>&gt; &gt; augmented, and dominant) comma pumps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No question, our Western forebears really figured out how to milk the reward-centers in our brains via technological and social innovation.

Sine have dyads and chords &quot;have partials&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; in the human ear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sorry, I&apos;m lost. Sines have dyads?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, typographical error there. &quot;Sine dyads and chords &quot;have partials&quot; in the human ear. That is, we can&apos;t truly test dyads and chords of &quot;simple sines&quot; with the human ear.</p><p>OK, but I don&apos;t think that these partials are going to be too loud. If<br/>you actually look up the characteristics of the distortion products<br/>generated by the ear - like the kind they use to measure your hearing,<br/>called DPOAE&apos;s - they&apos;re just not all that loud. But this is one<br/>subject I&apos;m not a total expert on, so you should take that with a<br/>grain of salt. But either way, even if you believe this sort of thing<br/>is important, then this is still a totally psychoacoustic thing, and<br/>that there&apos;s a certain limited sense in which psychoacoustic things<br/>like this can be interpreted as having &quot;fields of attraction&quot; or<br/>&quot;fields of interaction&quot; or &quot;fields of wakalix&quot; or whatever word you<br/>want to use.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m all for discussing fundamental concepts, but it doesn&apos;t seem &gt;like we<br/>&gt; &gt; are. It seems like you&apos;re saying the term &quot;field of attraction&quot; is<br/>&gt; &gt; misleading and that you&apos;d prefer a different term. OK, that&apos;s not a<br/>&gt; &gt; terrible idea. Now what?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dump the whole circular argument about &quot;JI&quot; being the foundation of Western music, which is the most bestest no duh cuz everybody luvs it,<br/>&gt; and everybody luvs it because it is natural, man, and that&apos;s why it&apos;s the foundation, etc. etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Invoking the magic of &quot;fields of attraction&quot; is key to that bogus argument.</p><p>No arguments here, but apparently Carl &quot;doesn&apos;t disagree&quot; too.</p><p>&gt; &gt; There is another sense in which I think the term &quot;field of &gt;attraction&quot; is<br/>&gt; &gt; important, and that&apos;s for intervallic categorical perception. It&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; precisely in this sense that I&apos;d like Carl&apos;s statements to not be<br/>&gt; &gt; interpreted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s an area we could go into without talking nonsense, but fields of interaction (or something like that), tuning tolerances, references to partials, etc. would be a better concepts to use. Clearly &quot;M3&quot; is NOT attached to 5:4, but how far from 2:1 can we go and retain the qualities and structural nature that we attach to &quot;octave&quot;? I don&apos;t know.</p><p>Wow. Well, that&apos;s a hell of a question. Maybe we should see if Graham<br/>can implement octave stretching in Lilypond and do some more examples.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=103038 href="#103038">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2012 2:29:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Jan 18, 2012 at 2:49 PM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not saying Western music didn&apos;t develop some significant xenharmonic attributes.

And I think he&apos;s probably right, considering that while many ideas from colonized cultures did cross-pollenate significantly into Western thought (see, for instance, Marco Polo), music is one area where adoption of Western norms is almost universal, despite that it&apos;s also one of the least value-laden aspects of the culture (unlike, say, religion).  There&apos;s got to be some reason for that, and I just put forward one hypothesis I have.  It could be wrong.</p><p>Contrary to Carl&apos;s observation, it is worth noting that there was harmonic Western music prior to the advent of meantone, which used thirds harmonically even though they were dissonant.  It&apos;s also worth noting that the Chinese developed 12-tone equal temperament long before we adopted it in the West, and never produced the kind of sophisticated harmony that we did.  It&apos;s also also worth noting that the copious use of extended chords was rare in Western music until the advent of jazz, which came directly from the interaction of African musicians in America trying to adapt to the Western musical norms (and trying to adapt those norms to their own ends as well).  You might even say that jazz is the most harmonically-advanced music yet seen on the planet, and that it&apos;s not entirely western in origin, and that it gave birth to modern pop music (the most viral form of music yet seen), thereby proving that NOT western music but a hybrid east/west music is that which is now found endemically all over the globe.  You might also conjecture about the possibility of an even-more-advanced harmonic future emanating from the Middle East, arising from the integration of quarter-tone melody with Western harmony by invoking the 11- and 13-limit, as a sort of &quot;reverse colonization&quot;.</p><p>Still, all we know for sure right now is that nobody finds 5-limit tonal harmony unpleasant, all else being equal.  The same cannot be said of any other form of harmony (except perhaps 3-limit Pythagorean), and I don&apos;t believe there is any reason to consider the source of that to be conditioning.  It hints at a certain universality, I think, at least about what people *will* like if given the chance.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=103047 href="#103047">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2012 6:16:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; What do you mean it would be fair evidence?

If we look at the history of Western harmony, by the time we&apos;re in &quot;common practice&quot;, parallel movement by fifths, with which parallel organum was rife, was &quot;forbidden&quot;. Any of the rare instances by a famous CP composer will surely be singled out by a composition teacher, but not so many centuries earlier, an entire tune could be harmonized by a running parallel fifth.</p><p>Rock guitar is full of parallel organum. Power chords, barre chords. It sounds good. Now look at the tunings of the times involved. When fifths were pure, it was cool to have loads of parallel fifths. When fifths were not pure 3:2s, parallel fifths went out. Fifths are damn near pure now, parallel fifths are in.</p><p>We don&apos;t need to get into a chicken-or-egg debate, it doesn&apos;t matter if parallel fifths were already out, enabling detuning of 3:2, or if the heavily tempered 3:2 pushed out the practice and no one cared because they were enjoying the pure thirds so much.</p><p>The principle sonority of the 1/4 comma era was the smooth triad, and definitely not open or parallel fifths. It is an anachronism to look at 1/4 comma meantone the way it is looked at on these lists. There is nothing wrong with this, as long as you wear a condom on your time travels, so to speak.</p></div><h3><a id=103051 href="#103051">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2012 9:34:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could have defined &quot;heard as&quot; differently, and easily arrived at a<br/>&gt; definition where Western listeners hear 5/4 as a major third, not the<br/>&gt; other way around.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>It is easy as pie to compress a tetrachord such that what is allegedly a major third, because supposedly under the magic spell of 5:4, is heard as Fa, and utterly un-M3.</p></div><h3><a id=103052 href="#103052">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2012 9:40:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Contrary to Carl&apos;s observation, it is worth noting that there was harmonic Western music prior to the advent of meantone, which used thirds harmonically even though they were dissonant.

But as far as tunings go, meantone&apos;s really kind of a blip and its existence doesn&apos;t prove much.  It was both preceded and succeeded by tunings that more strongly emphasized the purity of 3/2 over 4/3...and the absolute purity of 2/1 is absolutely demanded throughout most of the world-history of harmonic music.  Compromising the 3/2 for the sake of 4:5:6 was an experiment that culture at large ultimately rejected.</p><p>&gt; The irony here is that it is not impossible that you, Igliashon Jones, are more familiar, in &gt; actual experience, with the validity of what I am saying, than anyone... ever.</p><p>My experience is that what *I* like has little correlation with what is considered by most to be concordant.  And lots of people seem to like my music.  Lots of other people lament that I&apos;m wasting my talents on nasty-sounding tunings.  While I do believe damn near any tuning can be used successfully in certain applications, I am not sure if I believe that a tuning notably less concordant than 12-TET will succeed in attracting the kind of widespread and sustained interest I would like to see.  Simultaneously with these creeping doubts, I am growing tired of ceaseless novelty and experimentalism, and am starting to want to settle down with a couple tunings...maybe buy a house, raise a few kids, that kind of thing.</p><p>I&apos;ve already seen the failure of other tunings to thrive--31-TET was too big to make it, and too complicated at almost thrice the size of 12-TET (with between 5 and 7 sizes of 3rd, depending on if you want to count the 8/7 and 21/16 as &quot;3rds&quot; or not, that&apos;s between 25 and 49 triads, 125 to 343 tetrads, and 625 to 2401 pentads to sift through); 22-TET has problems that are harder to define, but for some reason it just doesn&apos;t seem to attract the kind of interest people think it should--maybe it&apos;s too large, maybe it&apos;s lacking accessible tonal structures, maybe 11-limit harmony isn&apos;t actually interesting to many people, or maybe it&apos;s too close to 24-TET that people would rather go that direction; 19-TET is a great meantone but just doesn&apos;t sound that good outside that context, and theorists have pushed it as hard as any tuning has ever been pushed to scant avail.  So far, no one&apos;s seriously proposed 11, 13, 14, 18, 20, 21, or 23, and proposals for 15, 16, and 17 have generated some interest but have been made too recently to evaluate.</p><p>JI has appeal as a general approach, but no single JI pitch-set seems poised for dominance, or demonstrates any clear superiority over alternatives.  Partch&apos;s 43-tone construction probably gets the most press.  Without a single scale, it&apos;s hard to construct a practical music theory, or to develop a compositional language comparable to what we have with 12-TET.</p><p>Oddly, next to JI the one tuning that seems to be thriving more than anything else is BP, which is macrotonal, equally-tempered, non-octave, and so thoroughly unlike all prior Western tunings that it&apos;s about as divorced from common-practice theory as one can possibly get.  Yet it offers concordant harmony 1:3:5:7:9 harmonies (if you avoid all the dissonances) and it&apos;s super-simple.  Next to BP and JI, quarter-tones are the only real visible alternative tuning system in the West.</p><p>So I&apos;m looking for a tuning that won&apos;t fail to thrive the way just about everything we discuss here has.  And I&apos;m pretty sure that means giving up my &quot;nihilism&quot; (as Carl calls it) and just accepting that concordance in some form is important and necessary to get any more than a handful of rugged individualists to pay attention.  The only question still open, as far as I&apos;m concerned, is what form concordance needs to take.</p><p>&gt; Let me put it this way: what are the major and minor triads of 20 equal division of the<br/>&gt; octave?</p><p>Good question!

Lots of other people &gt;lament that I&apos;m wasting &gt;my talents on nasty-sounding tunings.  &gt;While I do believe damn near &gt;any tuning can be used successfully in &gt;certain applications, I am &gt;not sure if I believe that a tuning &gt;notably less concordant than &gt;12-TET will succeed in attracting the &gt;kind of widespread and &gt;sustained interest I would like to see.</p><p>Maybe you&apos;ll have the same experience I did some year ago: one day you&apos;ll hear 12-tET and say hey, that&apos;s not actually very &quot;concordant&quot; at all, it&apos;s more dry and &quot;neutral&quot;, and the effects of concordance and discordance are actually achieved by the spectacular array of timbres used in Western music.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; 22-TET has problems that are harder to define,</p><p>Oh I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s so hard to define: 22 sounds cheesey, like playing EVERYTHING on a DX-7.</p><p>&gt; 19-TET is a great meantone but just doesn&apos;t sound that good outside &gt;&gt;that context, and theorists have pushed it as hard as any tuning &gt;has ever been pushed to scant avail.</p><p>I&apos;d like to hear work in 19-edo rather than 19-tET. I think 19-tET sounds like soggy meantone, people have commented on this over the last half-century or more.</p><p> &gt;So far, no one&apos;s seriously proposed 11, 13, 14, 18, 20, 21, or 23, &gt;and proposals for 15, 16, and 17 have generated some interest but &gt;have been made too recently to evaluate.</p><p>17 works for me. 16 is very pleasant, I am looking forward to using it in some soundtrack-type context someday.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; JI has appeal as a general approach, but no single JI pitch-set &gt;seems poised for dominance, or demonstrates any clear superiority &gt;over alternatives.  Partch&apos;s 43-tone construction probably gets the &gt;most press.</p><p>Partch, Carrillo and Wyshnegradsky get almost all the press. As is to be expected- in both theory and music they are completely non-threatening to entrenched hegemonies.</p><p>&gt; Without a single scale, it&apos;s hard to construct a practical music &gt;theory, or to develop a compositional language comparable to what we &gt;have with 12-TET.</p><p>There are other ways, but that would be long discussion. But I see what you mean.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oddly, next to JI the one tuning that seems to be thriving more &gt;than anything else is BP, which is macrotonal, equally-tempered, &gt;non-octave, and so thoroughly unlike all prior Western tunings that &gt;it&apos;s about as divorced from common-practice theory as one can &gt;possibly get.  Yet it offers concordant harmony 1:3:5:7:9 harmonies &gt;(if you avoid all the dissonances) and it&apos;s super-simple.</p><p>BP is also non-threatening to entrenched hegemonies, because it has such a specific character. I think BP sounds very nice indeed, though.</p><p>&gt;Next to BP and JI, quarter-tones are the only real visible &gt;alternative tuning system in the West.</p><p>A century of evidence tells us that quarter-tones just don&apos;t work for non-satanic harmony. Given appropriately written music, an ensemble could be trained to read quartertones but play sensitively to adaptive Just interpretations.  This in my opinion is what should have happened with quartertones, but audibly did not.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I&apos;m looking for a tuning that won&apos;t fail to thrive the way just &gt;about everything we discuss here has.  And I&apos;m pretty sure that &gt;means giving up my &quot;nihilism&quot; (as Carl calls it) and just accepting &gt;that concordance in some form is important and necessary to get any &gt;more than a handful of rugged individualists to pay attention.  The &gt;only question still open, as far as I&apos;m concerned, is what form &gt;concordance needs to take.</p><p>Or you could put together a hard and heavy band and be the king of discord.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let me put it this way: what are the major and minor triads of 20 equal division of the<br/>&gt; &gt; octave?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good question!  You might want me to say, &quot;0-420-720 and 0-300-720 cents, obviously&quot;, but 0-360-720 could just as easily stand in for both of them, or 0-360-660 and 0-300-660 could, too.  If you gave me any of those and told me &quot;tune this so it sounds in tune&quot; (and I didn&apos;t feel like being pedantic), I&apos;d tune it to some 5-limit chord.</p><p>Yes there&apos;s more than one, isn&apos;t there? But how is this so? If &quot;major triad&quot; were 4:5:6, and you buy the whole thing about approximation by proximity, you&apos;d have to choose 0-360-720. And sure enough if I&apos;m listening in a JI way, for smoothness, that&apos;s the best 4:5:6. But as soon as you start playing it, it is clear that the other choices you mention offer actual major and minor chords, whereas 0-360-720, despite being the best 4:5:6, is not a major triad at all. A major triad has a major third and a minor third.</p><p>0-420-720 and 0-360-660 both work, and even sound, like major triads. The ability to alternate with minor, without needing additional interval sizes (you could have said &quot;0-360-720 and 0-300-720&quot;) is part of the definition of &quot;major triad&quot;. In the case of 20-edo you can see this essential characteristic brutally override approximation of 4:5:6.</p><p>On the other hand you could conceive your 20-edo music in terms of JI smoothness and throw out the stuff that makes major/minor as we hold it.</p><p>Either way, I think this is a clear example of how 4:5:6 and &quot;major triad&quot; do not equate. But I&apos;m not trying to create a false dichotomy- clearly in practice there is a continuum between the two concepts.</p></div><h3><a id=103115 href="#103115">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2012 1:11:52 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Jan 20, 2012 at 4:06 PM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could also have said &quot;24-edo FTW!&quot; as a sarcastic response.

It enjoyed a few centuries of non-exclusive use in select European countries.</p><p>So you also do not think of 12-tET as a meantone?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Either way, my original point was about principles of approximating Just. 1/4-comma kicks ass at feeling like 4:5:6. Try a major triad with the fifth a quarter-comma sharp from 3:2, rather than flat. I&apos;d say it is certainly less 4:5:6 sounding, wouldn&apos;t you?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nope.  Sounds about as good to me.</p><p>I didn&apos;t say &quot;good&quot;, I said &quot;like 4:5:6&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Maybe you&apos;ll have the same experience I did some year ago: one day you&apos;ll hear 12-tET<br/>&gt; &gt; and say hey, that&apos;s not actually very &quot;concordant&quot; at all, it&apos;s more dry and &quot;neutral&quot;, and<br/>&gt; &gt; the effects of concordance and discordance are actually achieved by the spectacular<br/>&gt; &gt; array of timbres used in Western music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have deluded myself in the past into thinking 12-TET sounds awful and discordant compared to nice, pure, 5-limit harmony.  The revelation I eventually had was that it actually doesn&apos;t.  It&apos;s quite a nice tuning.  300 cents and 400 cents are both lovely 5-limit intervals in a variety of other temperaments, plenty smooth and nice to my ears.</p><p>I&apos;m not really much of a fan of nice, pure 5-limit harmony. And I don&apos;t think 12-tET sounds discordant. It sounds dry and neutral. Pretty blank. Which turns out to be a wonderful thing, in hindsight- the amount of timbral variety developed to compensate is astronomically greater than all the instrumental timbres of all the other cultures with far more colorful tunings, put together.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s so hard to define: 22 sounds cheesey, like playing EVERYTHING on &gt; a DX-7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I dunno, Paul&apos;s &quot;Tibia&quot; was pretty legit.  But otherwise I tend to agree.  At least about my own music in 22.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d like to hear work in 19-edo rather than 19-tET. I think 19-tET sounds like soggy<br/>&gt; &gt; meantone, people have commented on this over the last half-century or more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It sounds like a fine meantone to me.  Can&apos;t tell it apart from 31, TBH.</p><p>I think all meantones have a certain sogginess about them, including 1/4-comma.  Then again 4:5:6 has a languid quality that isn&apos;t far from soggy.</p><p>Sometimes there is a fine line between moist and fetid.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A century of evidence tells us that quarter-tones just don&apos;t work for non-satanic<br/>&gt; &gt; harmony. Given appropriately written music, an ensemble could be trained to read<br/>&gt; &gt; quartertones but play sensitively to adaptive Just interpretations.  This in my opinion is<br/>&gt; &gt; what should have happened with quartertones, but audibly did not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, they don&apos;t go away, and the only major-label band I&apos;ve seen use microtones used 24-edo.  Some schools actually teach quarter-tone techniques in composition.  And there&apos;s a huge field of theory based on bastardizing Middle Eastern music into the quarter-tone system.  I&apos;m sure someone will eventually figure out that if you use some of the alternate MOS&apos;s in 24, you can get non-Satanic harmony.  Barbados[9] sounds pretty nice, so does Mohajira[10].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Or you could put together a hard and heavy band and be the king of discord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No one will hear the difference.  Did you hear that Swedish quarter-tone metal band?  Fat lot of charm the quarter-tones added.</p><p>I meant actually hard and heavy, not heavy metal.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes there&apos;s more than one, isn&apos;t there? But how is this so?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because none of them quite gets 4:5:6 right, but they&apos;re all in the &gt;rough vicinity of it.  They all approximate it to some extent, to &gt;the extent that it&apos;s reasonable to say any chord approximates any &gt;other chord.</p><p>You&apos;re missing the point that the most accurate approximation to 4:5:6 offered in the tuning is simply not a major triad.</p></div><h3><a id=103122 href="#103122">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/20/2012 2:29:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Fri, Jan 20, 2012 at 4:34 PM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Beats me- I suspect that close-but-no-cigar approximation is responsible.

I definitely wouldn&apos;t say there&apos;s a clear unambiguous<br/>VF though, as there is for something like 2:3:4:5 or whatever. I can<br/>sort of block out different notes and then different VFs can pop out.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=103286 href="#103286">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2012 1:37:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Virtual fundamentals can also be ambiguous due to inharmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; timbres, cf. marimba and other &quot;tuned&quot; percussion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the VF for a second-inversion chord, if the lowest note is<br/>&gt; doubled in the bass, is pretty ambiguous too.</p><p>Yes, I already said that.
