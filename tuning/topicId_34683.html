(That&apos;s what<br/>&gt;&gt; I need: one more silly problem to solve.)</p><p>Carl asked:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What pages?<br/>&gt;<br/>I had posted a request for anyone interested to look at a &quot;Natural Ear<br/>Training&quot; preface I&apos;m about to publish. The idea was to identify any<br/>statements I may have to &quot;eat&quot; later.</p><p>I included a URL that I thought would point directly to the page, but folks<br/>couldn&apos;t get to it. I had done this before with no problem. I suspect it has<br/>to do with my new .com domain. It really is an Earthlink address &quot;under<br/>cover.&quot; It appears that one has to come in by the front door in order to<br/>navigate to the page in questions. I haven&apos;t checked with Earthlink yet to<br/>see if there is another way.</p><p>If you (or anyone) have the time and interest, go to &lt;<a href="http://stage3music.com">stage3music.com</a>&gt; and<br/>click &quot;writing about...&quot; then &quot;Natural...more info&quot; then &quot;read the preface.&quot;<br/>I&apos;ll appreciate all the feedback I can get.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
