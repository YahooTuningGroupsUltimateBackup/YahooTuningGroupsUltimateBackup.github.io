The 13-note scale gives us four<br/>triads, as well as 11 and especially 13 harmonies.</p><p>31+10  4/41</p><p>This is the 41-et version of miracle, so it comes in for some stiff<br/>competition from 31 and 72. Both 31 and 41 map 13 to -3 secors, and<br/>if you aren&apos;t quite as picky as some about intonation it is a viable<br/>alternative.</p><p>29+12 17/41</p><p>Two systems with good fifths give us a fifth system which is the 41-et<br/>version of schismic, with primes mapped to [-1,8,14,18,-20,-7,3]. The<br/>53-et gives it stiff competition. Graham also calls this Cassandra 2.</p><p>26+15  11/41</p><p>We have a prime mapping [-9,-10,3,-2,-16], so scales in this system<br/>are interesting for exploring the higher prime limits. We have scales<br/>3838388, 33533533535 and 333233323332332 of size 7,11, and 15, and<br/>the 11-note scale already has quite a bit of harmony on offer.<br/>Certainly one worth exploring!</p><p>22+19  13/41</p><p>This is good for triads, as we would expect, and is quite a nice<br/>system, which Graham has dubbed &quot;Magic&quot;. This and the previous<br/>generator seem to be the most interesting ones for the 41-et, because<br/>for both the 41-et seems to be the right way to make use of them. We<br/>have generator map [5,1,12,-8] and scales 11 2 11 2 11 2 2,<br/>9229229222, 7222722272222, and 5222252222522222, of sizes 7, 10, 13<br/>and 16--of course 19 and 22 also if we want to go that high! The<br/>7-note scale has two complete triads and a lot (of course) of major<br/>thirds.</p><p>24+17  12/41</p><p>This has a map to primes of [2 -16 13 5 -1], and a neutral third<br/>generator which we can consider to be 11/9 or 16/13. Graham seems to<br/>like it, and it would be a good way to explore 11 and 13 if you are<br/>prepared not to have much 5 or 7.</p></div>
