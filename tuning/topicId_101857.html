Each Sagittal symbol represents a specific (possibly tempered) frequency ratio. That is the primary consideration.</p><p>&gt; or on the other hand if there is always a specific size ordering of Sagittal accidentals that must be preserved regardless of tempering.<br/>&gt;</p><p>We attempt to preserve the size ordering of the symbols (as per strict JI) whenever possible. So when a temperament gives you a choice of several commatically-valid sets of accidentals, size order is a very important consideration in choosing between them. Choosing a _good_ sagittal notation for a tuning, from among those which are commatically valid, is something of an art. There are several other considerations as well, such as tempered size close to untempered size, consistency of &quot;flag arithmetic&quot; and having the the multi-shaft symbols in the second half-apotome recapitulate the sequence of flag combinations in the first half-apotome, consistency with standard notations for related standard tunings, staying within the smallest standard subset possible e.g Spartan or Athenian, using more popular symbols, etc. etc.</p><p>These are not like sagittal _laws_, but are just things that everyone comes to value who thinks about the problems deeply enough with enough different tunings, although folks may disagree on the the fine balance of relative importance of these things.</p><p>The abovementioned primary consideration has been broken (or perhaps I should say bent) in a _very_few_ places because of the sheer weight of these secondary considerations.</p><p>&gt; As a specific example, consider superpelog temperament: <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=9_5c&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=9_5c&limit=7</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In superpelog, 2 generators is 4/3, so every other note can be represented as the basic chain of fourths in Sagittal.

But it is not recommended. I&apos;d go to higher prime-limit extensions of the temperament until I find a pair of valid accidentals that does not involve a size reversal relative to JI. And look at standard notations for related ETs.</p><p>What Mike said about not being allowed to use accidentals whose tempered size is zero or negative, should probably be extended to avoiding _pairs_ of symbols that differ by a flag whose standalone comma interpretation has zero or negative size in the temperament, in this case the left barb /|. But such an extension isn&apos;t a law, just a good idea.</p><p>&gt;Or instead, could you have a system where |) is the 36/35 and /|) is the 64/63, even though they correspond to JI backwards?<br/>&gt;</p><p>No. That would be completely outside Sagittal.</p><p>&gt; Of course, as a practical matter you&apos;d want to avoid this kind of confusion as much as possible, but I&apos;m interested in which one the Sagittal system defines to be technically correct usage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s say we&apos;re hundreds of years in the future when xenharmonic music has finally caught on and everyone&apos;s into it, and I&apos;m a hotshot trombone player who claims to be able to sightread *anything* in Sagittal perfectly.

So if the primary comma makes no sense when tempered (i.e. it becomes zero or negative or way out of size order with other symbols) you would try tempering the secondary comma meaning of that symbol.</p><p>The secondary comma, for those symbols that have them, is always a more complex comma whose untempered size differs by less than half a cent from the primary comma. The most notable example is /|) whose secondary comma is the 13-medium-diesis 1024:1053.</p><p>Automated playing of sagittal is possible given only the temperament mapping and the fixed mapping from symbol to primary comma.</p><p>That mapping is called the Sagittal Character Map and is on the sagittal website in several formats, although it needs updating to include the accented symbols.<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal</a></p><p>It doesn&apos;t list secondaries. Why not? There is an alternative way of viewing secondary commas. A secondary comma is simply the primary comma for a symbol differing by a mina accent (approx 0.4 c) up or down. The accent has simply been dropped because no other symbols in the notation for that tuning have accents and there is no possibility of confusion. For example 1024:1053 is the primary comma for the  /|). symbol. The period or full-stop after the /|) represents a downward right accent in text.</p><p>See <a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/SagittalJI.gif">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/SagittalJI.gif</a></p></div><h3><a id=101862 href="#101862">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2011 9:13:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Very clear and helpful answer, Dave.

Note: I&apos;m not sure, but you may have to install Excel&apos;s math toolpack in order for all of the functions to work.)  You can enter a ratio in cells E1872 and F1872, and the apotome complement will appear in the row above (you may have to fiddle with the numbers in cols. E &amp; F in the row below to get the complement ratio into lowest terms, or you can add a formula that checks cells Q1872 and R1872 to come up with the desired values).</p><p>As you examine the various cells that contribute to the weighted complexity in col. M, you&apos;ll see that it&apos;s not a simple calculation; several different things were taken into account (prime limit, number of prime factors and their distribution in numerator vs. denominator, the value of the 3-exponent, and the comma &quot;slope&quot;), and the last three were weighted by the factors in row 1.  The factors were determined subjectively (by trial &amp; error) to get the simplest commas to sort in what Dave &amp; I agreed to be the most appropriate order; e.g., Didymus&apos; (syntonic) comma (5C) and Archytas&apos; (septimal) comma (7C) should be less complicated than the schisma (5s) or the pythagorean comma (1C).  The color-coding for the comma names &amp; ratios is: magenta for a ratio that defines an athenian-level symbol; orange for a promethean-level symbol (all unaccented symbols not athenian-level); yellow for herculean-level symbols (left-accented only); green for olympian-level symbols (right-accented, for the remaining &quot;minas&quot;, defined by 233-EDA boundaries); cyan for ratios that could be assigned unique symbols not previously defined (although we have chosen not to do this, so that the notation does not become more complicated than it already is).</p><p>There are two columns (A &amp; B) listing popularity rank, because that was determined twice, using slightly different methods; the second method, Pop2, is the one we&apos;re currently using.  Popularity was calculated only for intervals less than 1/2-apotome, so the larger of each apotome-complement pair was assigned the same popularity ranking as the smaller (plus .1, so they&apos;ll sort with the smaller one first).  Note that apotome-pairs will have differing weighted complexity, e.g., 9.162 for 27:28 vs. 15.328 for 57344:59049.</p><p>--George</p></div>
