It may be that I&apos;m dense, or it may be that<br/>the existing web resources are inadequate (or both).</p><p>Monz has just put his dictionary page on the topic back on-line.<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/tondiam.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/tondiam.htm</a><br/>I read it some time ago and I failed to understand (a) why it was called a<br/>diamond (except in the 5-limit case) and (b) that in a 2N-1 limit diamond<br/>there were N otonalities and N utonalities (e.g. for 11-limit N=6). This is<br/>a serious local maximum in consonances per tone, for strict JI. However,<br/>one can&apos;t blame Monz, since he is simply quoting Partch. And thanks Monz,<br/>for your recent email explaining things further.</p><p>Perhaps someone else can benefit from the following development of the<br/>11-limit diamond. This diamond is contained within all of Partch&apos;s tunings.</p><p>First make a 2 dimensional array of the fractions between all the odd<br/>numbers up to our chosen limit.</p><p>den|          numerator<br/>om.| 1    3    5    7    9   11<br/>---|-----------------------------<br/> 1 | 1/1  3/1  5/1  7/1  9/1 11/1<br/>   |<br/> 3 | 1/3  3/3  5/3  7/3  9/3 11/3<br/>   |<br/> 5 | 1/5  3/5  5/5  7/5  9/5 11/5<br/>   |<br/> 7 | 1/7  3/7  5/7  7/7  9/7 11/7<br/>   |<br/> 9 | 1/9  3/9  5/9  7/9  9/9 11/9<br/>   |<br/>11 | 1/11 3/11 5/11 7/11 9/1111/11</p><p>Notice that every row is an otonal hexad and every column a utonal one. One<br/>diagonal consists of 6 spellings of 1/1. And because 3 and 9 are not<br/>relatively prime (i.e. they have a common factor) there are two spellings<br/>of 3/1 and two of 1/3. So there are only 29 different tones<br/>(octave-equivalent).</p><p>Now rotate it 45 degrees clockwise and distort it to a rhombus (a.k.a<br/>&quot;diamond&quot;).</p><p>                     1/1<br/>                 1/3     3/1<br/>             1/5     3/3     5/1<br/>         1/7     3/5     5/3     7/1<br/>     1/9     3/7     5/5     7/3     9/1<br/> 1/11    3/9     5/7     7/5     9/3    11/1<br/>     3/11    5/9     7/7     9/5    11/3<br/>         5/11    7/9     9/7    11/5<br/>             7/11    9/9    11/7<br/>                 9/11   11/9<br/>                    11/11</p><p>The 1/1&apos;s now form the &quot;spine&quot;.</p><p>Assume octave-equivalence and put all the tones in first-octave form. We<br/>follow Partch and retain different spellings for the multiple 1/1&apos;s, 3/2&apos;s<br/>and 4/3&apos;s. i.e. We don&apos;t reduce them all to lowest terms.</p><p>                     1/1<br/>                 4/3     3/2<br/>             8/5     3/3     5/4<br/>         8/7     6/5     5/3     7/4<br/>    16/9    12/7     5/5     7/6     9/8<br/>16/11   12/9    10/7     7/5     9/6    11/8<br/>    12/11   10/9     7/7     9/5    11/6<br/>        20/11   14/9     9/7    11/10<br/>            14/11    9/9    11/7<br/>                18/11   11/9<br/>                    11/11</p><p>Now Partch shuffles the hexad lines (no hexads are broken), so that pitch<br/>increases from left to right.</p><p>                     7/7<br/>                12/7     7/6<br/>            11/7     3/3    14/11<br/>        10/7    11/6    12/11    7/5<br/>     9/7     5/3    11/11    6/5    14/9<br/> 8/7     9/6    20/11   11/10   12/9     7/4<br/>     4/3    18/11    5/5    11/9     3/2<br/>        16/11    9/5    10/9    11/8<br/>             8/5     9/9     5/4<br/>                16/9     9/8<br/>                     1/1</p><p>This corresponds to the diagram on p. 159 of &apos;Genesis of a music&apos;. The<br/>notes to the left of the central spine are to be taken as being in a lower<br/>octave than those to the right of it, so all the hexads are now in the form<br/>8:9:10:11:12:14 and 1/(8:9:10:11:12:14).</p><p>I think that&apos;s absolutely brilliant. Unlike our usual prime lattices, the<br/>same pitch can occur more than once in strict JI, and there is no<br/>one-to-one mapping of interval and vector, but it beautifully reduces the<br/>dimensionality (from 4 down to 2) by breaking some of the graphical<br/>connections and making them nominal ones (by name) instead. AND it orders<br/>the pitches somewhat.</p><p>Notice however that it doesn&apos;t order the pitches as well as the following.<br/>I&apos;ve also reduced everything to lowest terms this time.</p><p>                     1/1<br/>                11/6    12/11<br/>             5/3     1/1     6/5<br/>         3/2    20/11   11/10    4/3<br/>     4/3    18/11    1/1    11/9     3/2<br/> 7/6    16/11    9/5    10/9    11/8    12/7<br/>    14/11    8/5     1/1     5/4    11/7<br/>         7/5    16/9     9/8    10/7<br/>            14/9     1/1     9/7<br/>                 7/4     8/7<br/>                     1/1</p><p>As well as ordering them primarily from left to right, this orders them<br/>secondarily from back to front (on the right hand side) or front to back<br/>(on the left hand side). But this gives hexads 7:8:9:10:11:12 where the<br/>root is not octave-equivalent to the virtual fundamental.</p><p>In the 13-limit diamond, the best ordering of pitches also gives an<br/>octave-equivalent root (8:9:10:11:12:13:14). But IMHO ratios of 13 are not<br/>good value (being too close to the 11-limit ratios). Better to add other<br/>11-limit ratios (as Partch usually did).</p><p>Many thanks to Paul Erlich for checking this for accuracy (and explaining<br/>it to me in the first place).</p><p>Paul pointed out that we might have avoided the (possibly obscure)<br/>shuffling step by starting with the array headings 8 9 10 11 12 14 rather<br/>than 1 3 5 7 9 11, and pointing out that 8 9 10 11 12 14 is<br/>octave-equivalent to 1 9 5 11 3 7. However, I feel that this is too<br/>specific to the 11-limit case and would obscure the general principles that<br/>apply to all tonality diamonds. Also we have seen that Partch&apos;s ordering of<br/>the pitches is something of a compromise.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=7681 href="#7681">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
