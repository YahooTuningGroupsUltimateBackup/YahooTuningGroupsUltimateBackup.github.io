It has 3 beats per second (or double the metronome speed of 89) if we are starting from A=440; or 2.8 beats (double the metronome 84) if starting from A=415. This establishes the boundary for the four intervening 5ths, F-C-G-D-A: our regular size of 5ths, 1/6 Pythagorean comma. All four of those 5ths will now become equally spaced within that region, tempered 1/6 comma each.<br/>   Tenor F fourth down to C temporarily pure. (See why we&apos;re doing this temporary step...)<br/>   Tenor A fifth down to D temporarily pure.<br/>   Tenor G from that C and D so the fourth D-G beats 1.5 times as fast as the fifth C-G. (Triplets against duplets.)<br/>   Middle C from the tenor F and that G, likewise: the fourth G-C beating as triplets against the duplets of the fifth F-C.<br/>   Middle D from tenor G and A likewise.<br/>   Correct the lower D and C to match these two.<br/>   Middle E from tenor A slightly flat, same quality as these other fifths. It should beat as a major third from middle C at 4.5 times per second. (4.2 if you started from an A=415.) Also check it as a 10th from tenor C, the same 4.5 times per second. An excellent test for this particular F-A and C-E is found at bar 21 of the WTC book 1 C major prelude. These two major thirds should have exactly the same character as one another, although the beat rate is different (since the pitch is different). Coincidentally (?) this is at the golden mean of this piece.... The A-E fifth should beat exactly half as fast as our original F-A major 3rd, sharing the same A.<br/>   Copy middle E down to tenor E. For especially careful accuracy, fuss with both these E&apos;s until all four of the following points are true:<br/>      (1) Whatever speed the tenor D-A 5th is, the fifth A-E across middle C should beat in 3/2 ratio from that speed (i.e. triplets vs duplets).<br/>      (2) Likewise, whatever speed the tenor F-A major 3rd is, the middle C-E major 3rd is triplets against its duplets. [We are up a fifth on the keyboard, and all frequencies are 3/2 as much.]<br/>      (3) Playing the tenor E as a 4th against tenor A, it should beat exactly half as fast as our original F-A major 3rd. Likewise, the A-E 5th we are testing across middle C should be exactly half as fast as our original F-A major 3rd.<br/>      (4) The octave E must of course be pure! Tune the intervening B pure with both of them.</p><p>   The above procedure has put all the naturals (except B) into regular 1/6 comma temperament, the same as the first half of &quot;Vallotti&quot;: F-C-G-D-A-E all tempered identically. Bach&apos;s temperament finishes differently, as follows:<br/>   Pure fifths E-B-F#-C#.<br/>   Pure fifths F-Bb-Eb. This is a step to set the Eb exactly; we will move this temporary Bb soon.<br/>   Tune G# pure to C# and then slightly lower it so the C#-G# fifth and the Ab-Eb fifth have the same quality: very slow beat from each.<br/>   Lower Bb slightly so it has a slow beat from Eb like that of C#-G# and Ab-Eb.<br/>   Make all octaves and unisons pure to finish the instrument: all the bass, then all the treble.<br/>  Summary<br/>   1/6 comma fifths F-C-G-D-A-E<br/>   pure fifths E-B-F#-C#<br/>   1/12 comma fifths C#-G#-D#-A#<br/>   1/12 comma wide diminished sixth resulting at A#-F<br/>  as compared to, starting from C</p><p>  3/2<br/>  3/2<br/>  5/4<br/>  3/2<br/>  3/2<br/>  3/2</p><p>  starting from C again, and retuning F# when it is arrived at</p><p>  4/3<br/>  4/3<br/>  8/5<br/>  4/3<br/>  4/3<br/>  4/3</p><p>  if you retune any composition that sounds good in 12-tET it will sound good in the mystical tuning.</p><p>  the Secor is exceptional, to say the least, very impressive!</p><p>  thanks,</p><p>  rt</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Be a PS3 game guru.<br/>Get your game face on with the latest PS3 news and previews at Yahoo!

Get A from the tuning fork or other appropriate source.<br/>    b.. Tenor F-A (below middle C) beating wide 3 beats per second. It has 3 beats per second (or double the metronome speed of 89) if we are starting from A=440; or 2.8 beats (double the metronome 84) if starting from A=415. This establishes the boundary for the four intervening 5ths, F-C-G-D-A: our regular size of 5ths, 1/6 Pythagorean comma. All four of those 5ths will now become equally spaced within that region, tempered 1/6 comma each.<br/>    c.. Tenor F fourth down to C temporarily pure. (See why we&apos;re doing this temporary step...)<br/>    d.. Tenor A fifth down to D temporarily pure.<br/>    e.. Tenor G from that C and D so the fourth D-G beats 1.5 times as fast as the fifth C-G. (Triplets against duplets.)<br/>    f.. Middle C from the tenor F and that G, likewise: the fourth G-C beating as triplets against the duplets of the fifth F-C.<br/>    g.. Middle D from tenor G and A likewise.<br/>    h.. Correct the lower D and C to match these two.<br/>    i.. Middle E from tenor A slightly flat, same quality as these other fifths. It should beat as a major third from middle C at 4.5 times per second. (4.2 if you started from an A=415.) Also check it as a 10th from tenor C, the same 4.5 times per second. An excellent test for this particular F-A and C-E is found at bar 21 of the WTC book 1 C major prelude. These two major thirds should have exactly the same character as one another, although the beat rate is different (since the pitch is different). Coincidentally (?) this is at the golden mean of this piece.... The A-E fifth should beat exactly half as fast as our original F-A major 3rd, sharing the same A.<br/>    j.. Copy middle E down to tenor E. For especially careful accuracy, fuss with both these E&apos;s until all four of the following points are true:<br/>      a.. (1) Whatever speed the tenor D-A 5th is, the fifth A-E across middle C should beat in 3/2 ratio from that speed (i.e. triplets vs duplets).<br/>      b.. (2) Likewise, whatever speed the tenor F-A major 3rd is, the middle C-E major 3rd is triplets against its duplets. [We are up a fifth on the keyboard, and all frequencies are 3/2 as much.]<br/>      c.. (3) Playing the tenor E as a 4th against tenor A, it should beat exactly half as fast as our original F-A major 3rd. Likewise, the A-E 5th we are testing across middle C should be exactly half as fast as our original F-A major 3rd.<br/>      d.. (4) The octave E must of course be pure! Tune the intervening B pure with both of them.<br/>    a.. The above procedure has put all the naturals (except B) into regular 1/6 comma temperament, the same as the first half of &quot;Vallotti&quot;: F-C-G-D-A-E all tempered identically. Bach&apos;s temperament finishes differently, as follows:<br/>    b.. Pure fifths E-B-F#-C#.<br/>    c.. Pure fifths F-Bb-Eb. This is a step to set the Eb exactly; we will move this temporary Bb soon.<br/>    d.. Tune G# pure to C# and then slightly lower it so the C#-G# fifth and the Ab-Eb fifth have the same quality: very slow beat from each.<br/>    e.. Lower Bb slightly so it has a slow beat from Eb like that of C#-G# and Ab-Eb.<br/>    f.. Make all octaves and unisons pure to finish the instrument: all the bass, then all the treble.<br/>  Summary<br/>    a.. 1/6 comma fifths F-C-G-D-A-E<br/>    b.. pure fifths E-B-F#-C#<br/>    c.. 1/12 comma fifths C#-G#-D#-A#<br/>    d.. 1/12 comma wide diminished sixth resulting at A#-F<br/>  as compared to, starting from C</p><p>  3/2<br/>  3/2<br/>  5/4<br/>  3/2<br/>  3/2<br/>  3/2</p><p>  starting from C again, and retuning F# when it is arrived at</p><p>  4/3<br/>  4/3<br/>  8/5<br/>  4/3<br/>  4/3<br/>  4/3</p><p>  if you retune any composition that sounds good in 12-tET it will sound good in the mystical tuning.</p><p>  the Secor is exceptional, to say the least, very impressive!</p><p>  thanks,</p><p>  rt</p></div><h3><a id=70596 href="#70596">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2007 9:24:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@coolgoose.com">genewardsmith@coolgoose.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 16 Mart 2007 Cuma 21:57<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: well temperament</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Raintree Goldbach<br/>&gt; &lt;thefractalgourmet@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   in the scale in question the primary chord is 1/1 512/405 3/2,<br/>&gt; which sounds better, to my ear, than the standard 1/1 5/4 3/2. the<br/>&gt; comma between 5/4 and 512/405 is 2048/2025, which, i believe, is 1/12<br/>&gt; of a pythagorean comma smaller than a syntonic comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s also 81/64 lowered by a schisma of 32805/32768, which means<br/>&gt; instead of comma of difference, you get a comma lowered by a schisma,<br/>&gt; which is the diaschisma, 2048/2025.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s simply a fact of life that people differ in how they react to<br/>&gt; intervals, and that you prefer 1-512/405-3/2 does not mean most<br/>&gt; people would.
