I would be interested to hear George Secor&apos;s response<br/>&gt; to the article on the Horn.</p><p>The idea of using tubing in lengths that are rational fractions of<br/>the total effective tube length (with no valves depressed) is<br/>intriguing, because it appears to be a way to overcome the shortfall<br/>in length that results when valves are depressed simultaneously<br/>(since the combinations are all rational values; see page 20).  It&apos;s<br/>not perfect, however, because the major 3rd that results is 15:19; to<br/>get a true 4:5 downward alteration you&apos;d need to &quot;lip&quot; the pitch<br/>upward by about a comma (which is more difficult on a brass<br/>instrument than &quot;lipping&quot; it downward).</p><p>My solution to the problem of shortfall is to make use of the<br/>compensating mechanism already present in the instrument (in<br/>conjunction with the thumb valve), but to connect it to the 3rd-valve<br/>tubing instead (which requires major surgery), leaving the thumb to<br/>operate a 3-position micro-interval valve -- admittedly a more<br/>drastic (and expensive!) change than what Marc has outlined.</p><p>The function of the finger valves is strikingly similar to what I<br/>advocate in that the first and second valves alter downward by<br/>approximately a major 2nd and minor 2nd, respectively, which retains<br/>their conventional functions, while the third valve alters downward<br/>by approximately a major 3rd (as in my plan), which makes it easier<br/>to fill the gap between the 2nd and 3rd harmonics (than if it were to<br/>lower by the conventional minor 3rd).</p><p>I thought I had a spreadsheet of my plan out there, but evidently<br/>not, so I&apos;ve just added it here:<br/><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/Brass.xls">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/Brass.xls</a></p><p>The tables use Donald Boucher&apos;s notation, which both Dave Keenan and<br/>I have seen before.  It was developed more recently than Sagittal and<br/>contains some similar ideas (which is not surprising, since Sagittal<br/>combines several of the best features of 20th-century microtonal<br/>notations).  My chief criticism is that there&apos;s too much to take in<br/>at once when reading the accidentals, in too large an area (above,<br/>below, and/or to the left of the conventional sharp/flat/natural<br/>symbol.  In Table 7 (page 24) observe the 3rd example on the top<br/>staff and the 4th, 6th, 7th, and 8th examples on the 3rd staff.  In<br/>each of these the compound accidentals alter in opposite directions<br/>from one another (bad form, IMO).</p><p>--George</p></div>
