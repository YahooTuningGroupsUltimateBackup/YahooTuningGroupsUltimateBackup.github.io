It&apos;s the old tic-tac-toe (or turtle back)<br/>number pattern that adds up to the same thing in all directions, like this...</p><p>8   1   6<br/>3   5   7<br/>4   9   2<br/>-------------<br/>15&apos;s</p><p>expanded...</p><p>17  24  1   8   15<br/>23  5   7   14  16<br/>4   6   13  20  22<br/>10  12  19  21  3<br/>11  18  25  2   9<br/>---------------------------<br/>65&apos;s</p><p>It always fascinates me because of how easy it is to generate these matrices<br/>if you know the pattern.  Just as long as it is square and has an odd length<br/>on its side, it works, and it is possible to generate infinitely huge (and<br/>seemingly complex (to me anyway)) matrices.</p><p>It occurred to me that there are some really cool tunings in there.</p><p>Has anybody done any work with something similar?<br/>Am I way out in left field?  (I wouldn&apos;t know if i was/am)</p><p>regards,<br/>andy</p></div>
