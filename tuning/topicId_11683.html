Annis wrote,</p><p>&gt;Now this is no surprise that the addition of the 7/5 would<br/>&gt;improve the overall sensation of consonance, I thought, until I<br/>&gt;checked the intervocalic ratios: 56:45, 25:21.  Now, 25:21 is only two<br/>&gt;cents off (301.85) a tempered minor third, but 56:45 is well away from<br/>&gt;anything at 378.6 cents (5/4 is 386.31).  I&apos;ve checked the tuning of<br/>&gt;the synth several times in desperation.</p><p>While you&apos;ve accepted 301.85 cents as a decent representation of a minor<br/>third, even though its 14 cents flat of 5:6, what you seem to miss is that<br/>378.6 cents is less than 8 cents flat of 4:5. So you&apos;ve divided the wolf<br/>fifth into two essentially consonant intervals, &quot;masking&quot; the wolf<br/>considerably.</p><p>I&apos;ve made reference to this kind of effect before. For example, some years<br/>ago I asked people on this list what would be the best major third to use<br/>with a  720&cent; fifth in a major triad. Though 720&cent; is kind of hard to take as<br/>a fifth on its own, those who did the experiment suggested major thirds in<br/>the 395&cent; range. As I see it, the major third is then about 9&cent; sharp, and the<br/>minor third is also about 9&cent; sharp, both acceptable enough to make those<br/>intervals recognizable, which goes a long way toward making the whole chord<br/>a pretty undeniable major triad. The same thing is happening in your<br/>example.</p><p>Once I have a workable model of triadic harmonic entropy, not just total<br/>dyadic harmonic entropy, a portion of this sort of &quot;masking&quot; will be<br/>quantifiable. The explanation of the portion I&apos;m referring to is essentially<br/>that although an out-of-tune 2:3 produces a not-too-strong sense of what the<br/>fundamental at 1 is, addng a note that allows one to construe the 2 and 3 in<br/>the 2:3 as the 4 in a pretty good 4:5 and the 5 in a pretty good 5:6, gives<br/>you a pretty clear sense that you&apos;re listening to the 4th, 5th, and 6th<br/>harmonics of a fundamental, and this &quot;sureness&quot; of fundamental sensation<br/>contributes to increased consonance.</p><p>In order to get a sense of how far this explanation goes in solving your<br/>dilemma, try the mirror-image version of this chord, with the &quot;minor third&quot;<br/>on the bottom and the &quot;major third&quot; on top. How much is the dissonance of<br/>the wolf fifth alleviated when this &quot;minor third&quot; is added? I would predict<br/>not as much, because the additional intervals in the minor triad do not<br/>affirm the same fundamental that the fifth is trying to affirm. However,<br/>there could still be some alleviation, since some of the &quot;masking&quot; might not<br/>be due to harmonic entropy but due to a more literal interpretation of<br/>&quot;masking&quot;. That would mean the suppression of sensitivity at frequencies<br/>where the sensory roughness of the out-of-tune intervals takes place,<br/>resulting from the additional frequencies.</p></div>
