The topic of pitch and color is kind of<br/>&gt; an obsession for me.  I have my own ideas about it which I apply to writing<br/>&gt; music in pure intonation, and I&apos;ve invented an electronic wind instrument<br/>&gt; based on these ideas.  As I&apos;ve been working on a book about it for a while<br/>&gt; now, I can give you a partial bibliography of interesting sources.</p><p>Thanks Haresh and Aaron for these posts. Sure to keep us all busy for<br/>months.</p><p>The teacher with whom I studied in Philadelphia during the late 70s, Edgar<br/>Stanistreet, often talked about improvising music from pitches based on<br/>colors. He told me he&apos;d played some art museum gigs in Paris in the &apos;20s<br/>where he spontaneously improvised pieces on the mandolin based on Picassos&apos;<br/>works exhibited there, and that Picasso later painted his painting &quot;the<br/>mandolinist&quot; with himself as the model. At some point I asked him what the<br/>colors corresponding to each of the notes were, he didn&apos;t answer this<br/>directly, he said instead that I just had to look and I&apos;d see them! 25 years<br/>later, I&apos;m still looking :-)</p><p>The fall colors are beautiful this morning here in New Hampshire, I am going<br/>to go out and enjoy them, and come back and play music.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:klezmusic@earthlink.net">klezmusic@earthlink.net</a></p></div>
