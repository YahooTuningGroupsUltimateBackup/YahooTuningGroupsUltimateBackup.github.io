(During<br/>their peak in the late &apos;70s and early &apos;80s, long before American punk<br/>was mainstream, the band was considered, not unwarrantedly, a thuggish<br/>and hostile street unit, although time has given their work a<br/>considerable measure of musical acclaim.) A worthwhile song is<br/>&quot;Damaged II,&quot; from 1981&apos;s Damaged LP Â— a live-in-studio recording in<br/>which intentional (and surprisingly scale-aware) use of quarter- and<br/>eighth-steps suggests a guitar in danger of detonation. Another is<br/>&quot;Police Story,&quot; most versions of which end in a cadence played a<br/>quarter-tone sharp, to similar effect.&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=72453 href="#72453">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2007 9:40:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; I think some punk guitarist did that to make their sound more<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonant and jarring, but I can&apos;t remember who it is/was.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could be wrong, but I think that was Black Flag&apos;s Greg Ginn.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Flag_%28band%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Flag_%28band%29</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=72471 href="#72471">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2007 2:43:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igliashon Jones wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think some punk guitarist did that to make their sound more<br/>&gt; dissonant and<br/>&gt;&gt; jarring, but I can&apos;t remember who it is/was.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could be wrong, but I think that was Black Flag&apos;s Greg Ginn.

The detuning of guitars were widely used though by just about all of them which was my own appeal to this music. Besides myself there was a group called Cypher which worked in microtones, a 22 tone 7 limit system.  Robert Rich would also appear in such venues. Here is where microtones became known and was met with as much shock as an idea. Go through the stuff written in the late 70&apos;s and early 80&apos;s and see where you find the word microtonality in the L.A. punk community.<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
