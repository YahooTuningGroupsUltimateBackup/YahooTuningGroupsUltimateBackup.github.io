The intervals are:</p><p>    4:5 major 3rd<br/>    5:6 minor 3rd<br/>    6:7 septimal minor 3rd (?)</p><p>and in the 1/ chord these appear with this last interval at the bottom of<br/>the chord.</p><p>On a 12et keyboard you get another interval closer to 5:6 instead of the<br/>6:7, and so you can achieve that as C-Eb-Gb-Bb, which has the major 3rd at<br/>the top instead of the bottom of the chord.  But this untonal chord provides<br/>no cue (that I know of) to allow you to hear the bottom interval as 6:7.  On<br/>the other hand, the 4:5:6:7 otonal chord has all the harmonics stacked up to<br/>give a strong hint that the mistuned 7 is actually meant to be heard as<br/>such.  At least that is what a lot of us have gotten used to listening to<br/>12et dominant 7th chords for all these years.  I always thought they sounded<br/>bad as a kid, but I grew used to it until recently.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=53571 href="#53571">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2004 6:24:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;traktus5&quot; &lt;kj4321@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; hi Paul - (I&apos;m referring to a tonalsoft excerpt which, according to<br/>&gt; Joe&apos;s indendation, is from one of your postings, which reads &quot;Our<br/>non-<br/>&gt; laboratory experiments on the harmonic entropy list seem to<br/>&gt; conclusively show that the dissonance of a chord can&apos;t be even<br/>close<br/>&gt; to a function of the dissonances of the constituent intervals. For<br/>&gt; example, everyone put the 4:5:6:7 chord near the top of their<br/>ranking<br/>&gt; of 36 recorded tetrads from least to most dissonant, while everyone<br/>&gt; put 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 much lower.&quot;</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; 4:5:6:7 on the piano would be c-e-g-Bb.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s as close as you can get to it on the piano, but of<br/>course it&apos;s still very different, since pianos are normally in 12-<br/>equal.</p><p>&gt; How would I play 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, and 1/4  on the piano?</p><p>If we keep using C as the lowest note, the closest piano chord would<br/>be C-Eb-Gb-Bb (1/1 would be the Bb two octaves higher), but again<br/>there&apos;s quite a big difference since the piano is in 12-equal.<br/>5:6:7:9 and 17:20:24:30 would also map to C-Eb-Gb-Bb on the piano but<br/>really all three JI chords sound quite different.</p></div>
