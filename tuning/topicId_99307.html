I think the scale is melodically bearable with a generator below 16-edo&apos;s 375 cents, but around there it gets harmonically iffy without matched timbres. Above there I agree it feels melodically less natural. Movement by 5/4s creates some progressions that I really really like though, regardless of the magic tuning.</p><p>-John</p></div><h3>Jake Freivald &#x3C;jdfreivald@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2011 5:51:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs,</p><p>I&apos;m really not a fan of the sustained synth chords at the beginning.<br/>They sound like someone trying to sound microtonal.

In jazz, if I said to play<br/>Emb5 -&gt; A7b13 -&gt; Dm7, you might play E locrian #2 over the first chord<br/>(from D mixo b6), A altered over the second chord (from Bb harmonic<br/>minor (!), makes use of 128/125 tempering), and D Dorian over the last<br/>chord. All of those scales are MODMOS&apos;s of meantone[7]. So although<br/>the whole thing loosely makes use of the 81/80 comma pump, you&apos;d play<br/>whatever scales you want over it to design the colors you want and not<br/>get trapped into the usual diatonic sound.</p><p>I&apos;d recommend doing the same thing with magic - find some cool scales<br/>for each chord, and then modulate by major third as you want - that<br/>way you aren&apos;t trapped into this dark, magic, augmented &quot;sound&quot; all<br/>the time. I think that scales that incorporate all of the chords we&apos;ll<br/>ever need are more the exception rather than the rule - in dicot<br/>temperament, for example, there&apos;s only one minor scale, but in<br/>meantone you need three to adequately represent common practice<br/>harmony.</p><p>You could try things like (in 19-equal) Cmaj - Gmaj - Emaj - Bmaj -<br/>G#maj - D#maj - Cbmaj - Gbmaj - Ebmaj - Bbmaj - Gmaj -&gt; back to Cmaj.<br/>Or maybe that chord progression is too drawn out for you, but the<br/>point is that there&apos;s no reason you can&apos;t move around by a fifth if<br/>you want. As for actually designing MODMOS&apos;s, just find the chroma<br/>(L-s) and move random notes around by it until you&apos;re happy. Since we<br/>don&apos;t really know how the MODMOS&apos;s work yet (probably will depend on a<br/>better generalization of propriety), I leave the rest to you.</p><p>In fact, why do you only have to play magic MOS scales over the magic<br/>tempered lattice at all? You could play a magic-tempered JI major<br/>scale over all of those chords, or if you want something a little more<br/>xenharmonic then you could try playing some mavila scales over each<br/>one in 16-equal, which supports both magic and mavila. Or what&apos;s more<br/>likely is you could decide to not just stick to one approach, play<br/>magic-ish scales sometimes, play mavila-ish scales other times, maybe<br/>throw diminished[8] in there if you want, etc.</p><p>Cliffnotes: There is more to &quot;magic temperament&quot; than playing major<br/>chords that move around by 5/4.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2011 10:59:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These have to be some of the most steady leads I&apos;ve ever seen from Igs.</p><p>Thanks, Michael.

You just can&apos;t beat that level of efficiency.  15 beats 19 in the 2.5.11 subgroup, Porcupine DUH.

If we&apos;re talking about repeated motions by<br/>something like 81/80 turning into something like 16/15, or whatever it<br/>is we&apos;re trying to do, then not only do the numbers involved quickly<br/>get huge, but we&apos;ve effectively just created some leverage with which<br/>to maneuver around the 5-limit lattice. I never thought something like<br/>amity would be useful for anything other than purely theoretical<br/>reasons, but this approach makes it possible to traverse huge portions<br/>of the JI lattice very easily and practically. Cmaj -&gt; A-m -&gt; D-m -&gt;<br/>G-maj -&gt; C-maj is a pretty simple motion that can move you by 81/80,<br/>so by doing that a number of times you can easily explore something<br/>like Amity or Gravity or Immunity or etc.</p><p>Perhaps we could come up with a &quot;pun badness&quot; score based on the<br/>number of 5/4, 3/2, and 6/5 motions that it takes to get to the comma<br/>in question (and hence traverse the pump). Two ways I can think of<br/>doing this</p><p>1) represent the comma in 2.3.5 space, drop the 2, and look at what<br/>you have left in the monzo for 3 and 5. Then come up with a third<br/>column representing 6/5 - condense as many +3 -5 motions into a single<br/>+6/5 motion as possible. Then either compute the naive score, or<br/>weight it so that motion by 3 is better than motion by 5, both are<br/>better than motion by 6/5, etc. If you pick the weighting to be a<br/>certain way you might be able to skip the condensation of everything<br/>into 6/5.</p><p>2) work out the minimal pump for the comma, and then take every step<br/>in this minimal pump that isn&apos;t 5/4, 3/2, or 6/5 and break it down<br/>into that. I can&apos;t tell if this will be the same as the above.</p><p>Any thoughts?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2011 7:21:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 34359738368/32958984375 seems cool, how are you analyzing it?
