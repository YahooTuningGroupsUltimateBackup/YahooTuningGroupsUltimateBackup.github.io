All interesting options. I&apos;ll check what is<br/>most convenenient and best suits my system. I have an old Midiman,<br/>but it uses the huge printer cable and goes into the printer port,<br/>which my laptop doesn&apos;t have. I used it with Rhapsody, maybe familiar<br/>to you as a subset of Encore, pretty nice music-publishing software<br/>I&apos;ve been using for arranging and composing common-practice music.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; In-Reply-To: &lt;9qmt73+fbhs@e...&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Wendell wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have a basic keyboard with signle-channel midi in and out.

It<br/>uses pitch bends sent to the sound card... It&apos;s multi-voiced and uses<br/>different timbres.  Running it with a sequencer is a *bit* more<br/>complex, and involves using MIDI YOKE, which I haven&apos;t messed with...<br/>but probably isn&apos;t very difficult to get going.</p><p>________ _______ ___________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
