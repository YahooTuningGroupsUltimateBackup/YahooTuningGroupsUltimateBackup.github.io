Perhaps it only seems majestic after<br/>the substantial tuning time they go through.  Anyway, I tried for<br/>about a year to learn piobreachd (not just pipe music, but the old,<br/>formal stuff, with songs lasting up to 40 minutes).  After a while,<br/>the practice chanter -- basically a tuned duck call -- gets irritating<br/>so I&apos;d grab the pipes and run out to a local park.  Kids from the<br/>surrounding area had to come hear what the amazing sound was.  I felt<br/>like the Pied Piper.  I&apos;ll always remember the shriek one girl let out<br/>when I kick-started the pipes without realizing just how close her<br/>little head was to the practice chanter.</p><p> &gt;More seriously, last year on holiday in Ireland my wife bought a few<br/> &gt;CDs, including the piping of Seamus Ennis.

That music was strongly influenced<br/>by Scottish music, and there&apos;s a very clear piping esthetic at work.<br/>If you look at &quot;The Northern Fiddler&quot; (out of print but I was lucky<br/>enough to find a copy years ago) is full of tunes where the C# is some<br/>other thing entirely.  You can get some of the field recordings from<br/>the book now (&quot;Bundle and Go,&quot; with John Doherty, as I recall; have it<br/>at home).</p><p>--<br/>wm</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/2000 7:15:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Ah, thanks Dave.
