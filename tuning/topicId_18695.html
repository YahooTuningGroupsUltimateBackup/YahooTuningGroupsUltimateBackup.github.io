Why does the &quot;common&quot; system of<br/>&gt; enharmonic sharps and flats in notation end up working for 19??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think it&apos;s just chance.  There is no basis in the enharmonic system<br/>&gt; for 19, is there... or is there...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regardless.  I, personally, feel such a notational system is poor,<br/>&gt; since is goes against ALL musicianship &quot;basic training.&quot;  Yes, and I<br/>&gt; mean 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose if someone hasn&apos;t HAD any &quot;basic training&quot; it wouldn&apos;t be<br/>&gt; much of a problem, but THOSE are not necessarily the kinds of<br/>&gt; musicians I am looking for...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would much rather use REAL NOTES (yes, derived from 12-tET) and use<br/>&gt; cents deviations from these than something &quot;ersatz&quot; or &quot;faux.&quot;</p><p>Joe, I think there is a real musical reason why the enharmonic notation for<br/>19-tet works very well. All the minor and major thirds in 19-tet get much<br/>closer to their just values than in 12-tet. So when you&apos;re playing a piece<br/>on a 19-tet fretted guitar, the choice between a C# and a Db is very easy to<br/>make. Is that really coincidence? Look at the seven note scale:</p><p>C D E F G A B C</p><p>Now we fill it up chromatically, first following 12-tet:</p><p>C . D . E F . G . A . B C (the dot might be called # or b, just the same)</p><p>Next following 19-tet:</p><p>C . . D . . E . F . . G . . A . . B . C ( every first dot is called # and<br/>every secon dot is called b, except for the dot in between B and C, and E<br/>and F, which may be called either # or b). This doesn&apos;t really go against<br/>&quot;basic training&quot;, for the ear still recognizes C D E F G A B C as an<br/>ordinary seven note scale. This works in the same way for 31-tet. You may<br/>take a 12-tet score for a traditional guitarpiece and sightread it<br/>instantaneaously in 19-tet. It will sound pretty close to meantone.</p><p>However, it will go against &quot;basic training&quot; if we use this system for<br/>21-tet:</p><p>C . . D . . E . . F . . G . . A . . B . . C</p><p>Now of course the seven note scale doesn&apos;t sound as the basic C D E F G A B<br/>C anymore. For example, the E# in this notation sounds virtually as an E in<br/>12-tet! Dans la poubelle!</p><p>If you want to use 19 pitches, but not 19-tet, I would say that the<br/>combination 12-tet with cents deviation would work better.</p></div><h3><a id=18725 href="#18725">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/14/2001 1:38:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Wim Hoogewerf&quot; &lt;wim.hoogewerf@f...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18695.html#18695">/tuning/topicId_18695.html#18695</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Next following 19-tet:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C . .
