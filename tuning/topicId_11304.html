I don&apos;t really get your<br/>remark above, because I don&apos;t see any necessary conflict between what you<br/>wrote and what Spud wrote, nor do I see how agreeing with me on Einstein<br/>balances your remark. Although Spud&apos;s suggestion does seem far-fetched, I<br/>would assume that Spud is familar with the fact that vowels are<br/>characterized by the absolute frequencies of their formants -- I&apos;m cc&apos;ing<br/>him in case you guys want to start a discussion on the topic of vowels in<br/>music.</p></div>
