Institutions of any kind<br/>usually suck, but I think this is particularly true of religious and<br/>artistic institutions. In the administrations of music conservatories and<br/>music departments of universities one will find more than a few frustrated<br/>failed musicians. I know this is true at Juilliard. Those who are successful<br/>doing their art may have some time to teach, but they definitely don&apos;t have<br/>time to be administrators. This fact alone (its psychological ramifications)<br/>suffices to account for why the institutions themselves suck. The students<br/>who pass through them are a different story, and those who are destined to<br/>be artists take what they can from the experience and assimilate it and move<br/>on. In this respect anyone with an open mind can be greatly benefited from<br/>attending an institution which, ultimately, sucks.</p><p>The situation is somewhat different in the sciences, including, say,<br/>musicology, where the academic institution exists primarily to support<br/>research and the students who pass through are expected to be enriched<br/>through their contact with  the researchers. Some will be inspired to join<br/>their ranks while most will pass through and return to the &quot;outside world&quot;<br/>It is interesting to note that esoteric compositional styles and experiments<br/>(like serialism) can only exist when they are supported in this way. Left in<br/>the market place they would quickly founder. I think this is a good thing<br/>and even though most of my serial CDs have a thick layer of dust on them I<br/>am glad that these kinds of experiments are made and supported. Some<br/>experiments are recognized by academia as valid and are supported while<br/>others  are ignored, as in science where there is a party line to toe and<br/>anyone who strays too much from it is punished (grants taken away, labs<br/>closed, etc.) Look at what happened to Duesenburg when he had the temerity<br/>to question the &quot;HIV causes AIDS&quot; equation, as well has Halton Arp when he<br/>questioned if  high redshift quasars were really at cosmological distances.<br/>As far as tuning goes, I suspect it can only get into academia by the &quot;back<br/>door&quot;, that is, composers who are already recognized by academia from their<br/>work as serialists can get away with writing other kinds of music too. The<br/>situation may be different in Europe, I wonder if Stockhausen, if he were a<br/>young composer, could get any support here in the usa now.</p><p>For any instrumentalist, the major focus of their stay at a conservatory or<br/>university music department is their contact with their teacher which is a<br/>one-on-one dynamic which exists largely untouched by the institution itself.<br/>One could easily just take private lessons with someone and get the same<br/>thing. Artistic degrees are only of value to those hoping to teach at an<br/>academic institution, and are totally irrelevant to an artist&apos;s audience.</p><p>dante</p></div><h3><a id=2781 href="#2781">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@home.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/8/1999 8:58:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rosati wrote:</p><p>&gt; As far as tuning goes, I suspect it can only get into academia by the &quot;back<br/>&gt; door&quot;, that is, composers who are already recognized by academia from their<br/>&gt; work as serialists can get away with writing other kinds of music too.

However, I<br/>never once experienced anyone discouraging me or criticizing my music<br/>because I used JI or influences outside the European tradition. Quite the<br/>contrary.</p><p>Of course, I did not have the luxury of having a teacher like Ben Johnston<br/>to teach me all about Partch, lattices, and so on, and I had to travel<br/>across town to UCLA to find a gamelan to play in. However, my teachers<br/>taught me many more important lessons that go much deeper than any tuning<br/>system.</p><p>It&apos;s true that university music degrees aren&apos;t for everyone. History shows<br/>that not only is it possible to be a great composer or performer without a<br/>degree, it&apos;s the rule rather than the exception, though I still believe<br/>that, everything else being equal, more education (however obtained) is<br/>always better than less.</p><p>It&apos;s also true that not every music department or teacher is ideal for<br/>every student. I commend the U of F faculty for their realistic and frank<br/>evaluation of Pat&apos;s future there. It would have been terrible for them to<br/>lie and put him through 4 years of hell. Likewise there are those who<br/>wouldn&apos;t be happy at USC or studying with me for that matter.</p><p>I would have to agree that many of the academic stereotypes of<br/>compositional style have an element of truth in them (except Babbittry -- I<br/>think few people take such strict serialism seriously anymore). But, first<br/>of all, that view overlooks the important exceptions, not to mention good<br/>music in those styles.</p><p>Insofaras composing in alternate tunings constitutes an exception, I would<br/>name myself and Larry Polansky and a number of others (whose names were<br/>listed in a previous series of posts). I certainly didn&apos;t get my job<br/>through the &quot;back door&quot; of serialism, and I&apos;m sure Larry didn&apos;t either.</p><p>Second, whatever the style of an academic composer, the most important<br/>thing is how they teach. I was lucky enough to have wonderfully encouraging<br/>(and tolerant) teachers*, but I don&apos;t believe they are so exceptional as<br/>everyone seems to think.</p><p>Bill</p><p>* P.S. Their names are Gerald Benjamin, William Thornton, Rick Lesemann,<br/>Gil Blount, and Tony Vazzana.

So I have chosen to study Raags privately as well as Just Intonation<br/>with Denny which i of course completed. And in the end I have struck up a nice<br/>relationship with Dr. Sain the Electroacoustics prof at UF<br/>not exactly a Maxfield or a Mumma but definitely in the know regarding C<br/>sound,Max granular synthesis etc....He allowed Experimental Audio Initiative<br/>one of my performing entities to perform a 31 minute hybrid media piece loosely<br/>based on my affection of the &quot;Obsidian Ocelot.....&quot;: Mind you this is in the<br/>student show where the longest other piece was about 4 minutes. It used 16<br/>sines,tabla,Harmonic Overtones singing and Microinterval Synthesizer,and spoken<br/>narrative. Apparently Allen Strange had a piece (I know hes on this list<br/>somewhere) on the bill but I did not see it because of work... So don&apos;t get me<br/>wrong I was merely commenting on one portion of the UF academia I snuck in the<br/>back door because frankly I could not afford to seek out the official teacher I<br/>needed I  got my degree from Denny and the WHP and it will fly right next to<br/>not beneath all my others.</p><p>Daniel Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: Daniel Wolf &lt;<a href="mailto:DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com">DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not surprising that the faculty in Florida had noth&#xFFFD;ng to offer to<br/>&gt; someone playing Hindustani music.
