And if I couldn&apos;t make<br/>that rapid-fire output and couldn&apos;t get rapid-fire input, and was<br/>limited to 5 posts a day (I hope 6 people don&apos;t respond to any of my<br/>messages!), then I&apos;d still be thinking it had to do with HE depriming,<br/>research would be slowed (even if this particular train of thought<br/>ends up leading nowhere).</p><p>I could continue to discuss this offlist with Carl and folks, but I&apos;d<br/>rather just work on this publicly, because if it ends up leading to<br/>anything useful there should be archives for people to go through, as<br/>I have the benefit of going through with the harmonic entropy list.

I, for<br/>one, certainly think you are getting somewhere and that it takes strong Ethics<br/>as it often goes against a lot of the theory you learned before IE it forced you<br/>to make the &quot;I knew a lot, but now I realize I no little&quot; response for the sake<br/>of a more inclusive theory.</p><p>  It is interesting you posted the topic as &quot;tuning-research&quot;...because I think<br/>that would be an IDEAL name for a new list where people who join agree to do a<br/>whole lot of debating for the sake of new theories.<br/>  If you started such a list I would gladly join and encourage anyone who<br/>doesn&apos;t mind low winding debates to join as well . :-)</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Wed, September 22, 2010 3:52:57 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] tuning-research</p><p>Hi all,</p><p>This is my last night in the States for 3 weeks - tomorrow morning I<br/>go to Haiti.
