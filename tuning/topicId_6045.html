I&apos;ve finally fixed the webpage:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/eqtemp.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/eqtemp.htm</a></p><p>There was some discussion here a few months ago,<br/>in which I contributed quite a bit, on Salinas.<br/>Did we ever settle the question of whether or not<br/>Salinas advocated 19-tET?</p><p>I already had 1924 as the date for Carillo&apos;s first<br/>publication advocating 24-tET.  Paul Erlich reminded<br/>me that Carillo was really championing 96-tET and<br/>its subsets, of which 24-tET is one.  I&apos;m looking for<br/>my copy of Gerald Benjamin&apos;s _Julian Carillo and<br/>&apos;Sonido Trece&apos;_ and can&apos;t find it: is 1924 the correct<br/>date for Carillo&apos;s publications on 96-tET?</p><p>Paul also pointed out to me that Joseph Schillinger<br/>advocated 144-tET (one of my own personal favorites),<br/>but didn&apos;t have the date.  The _Schillinger System<br/>of Musical Composition_ was published in 1946 - is<br/>this the book that has the info on 144-tET?  There<br/>are some more recent books containing Schillinger&apos;s<br/>work; the two listed in the U. of Penn library catalog are:</p><p>Title: Encyclopedia of rhythms : instrumental forms of harmony : a<br/>massive collection of rhythm patterns (evolved according to the<br/>Schillinger theory of interference) arranged in instrumental form / by<br/>Joseph Schillinger.<br/>Publisher: New York : Da Capo Press, 1976, c1966</p><p>Title: Mathematical Basis of the Arts<br/>Publisher: 1948</p><p>(BTW, Schillinger had already died in 1943, before his work was<br/>published.)</p><p>Paul also reminded me that Giacinto Scelsi composes<br/>in 24-tET.  Does anyone have the date of his earliest<br/>statement expressing a preference for this?  (Johnny<br/>Reinhard perhaps?)</p><p>And someone *please* give me some info on who it was<br/>who advocated 171-tET, and when.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
