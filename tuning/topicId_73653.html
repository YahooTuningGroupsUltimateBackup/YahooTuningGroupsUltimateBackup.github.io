But i&apos;m playing<br/>devil&apos;s advocate -- i do agree with you that &quot;harmonic&quot;<br/>is better.</p><p>&quot;Harmonic&quot; and &quot;partial&quot; are essentially synonymous.<br/>They both refer to the idea, modeled by Fourier Analysis,<br/>that a complex sound can be described as a conglomeration<br/>of sine-waves, each with their own amplitude envelope.<br/>The frequencies can also vary, but generally follow the<br/>arithmetic &quot;harmonic series&quot; 1:2:3:4:5:6:7... etc.</p><p>Calling them &quot;partials&quot; just makes obvious the fact<br/>that each of them is considered to be only a part of<br/>the whole complex sound. Thus, the lowest sine-wave is<br/>indeed both the &quot;first harmonic&quot; and the &quot;first partial&quot;.</p><p>The case of &quot;overtone&quot; is more complicated. The use<br/>of this word came about precisely as a result of the<br/>kind of thinking that you were doing when you criticized<br/>the use of &quot;partial&quot;. The lowest partial is felt to be<br/>the &quot;actual&quot; sound, and is in fact often called the<br/>&quot;fundamental&quot;.

He<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested that it would be best on pianos if<br/>&gt; &gt; the actual third<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; partial of the strings were supressed via<br/>&gt; &gt; placement of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hammers, to compensate for the stretching.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; djw<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By third partial, do you mean 4:1?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Carl<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; No, 3:1. (Third partial = &quot;second overtone&quot;).  The<br/>&gt; &gt; idea was to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; surpress the third partial of the string, which on<br/>&gt; &gt; a piano tends<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to vary from a 3:1, so that there were be no<br/>&gt; &gt; beating between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a the third partial of a lower tone and the first<br/>&gt; &gt; partial of an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; upper tone.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But by definition this tuning calls for tuning the<br/>&gt; &gt; 3:1 beatless.<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems like you&apos;re supressing the very thing<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;re improving!<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, it seems impractical (if not impossible) to<br/>&gt; &gt; have the<br/>&gt; &gt; hammers 1/3 of the way down the strings from the<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That said, I am totally unclear as to how the<br/>&gt; &gt; third partial<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would be surpressed on longer strings -- the<br/>&gt; &gt; hammer would have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be quite far out -- perhaps a mute of some sort<br/>&gt; &gt; could be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; placed at a node?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hm, perhaps.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Carl<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>_____________________________________________________________________<br/>_______________<br/>&gt; Building a website is a piece of cake.
