pictures in to a four tone state, thus the hue of a picture could<br/>be 2^16 as a binary tone sequence, and as could the tint of a picture, thus:</p><p>ONE PIXEL:-</p><p>       2^16 Hue                2^16 Tint<br/>     -----------------      ------------------<br/>4 3 | 0110110101111011 | 3 | 01101111101011101| 3 4</p><p>The above shows the codeing and encryption for varous pictures that need to<br/>be &quot;encapsulated&quot;
