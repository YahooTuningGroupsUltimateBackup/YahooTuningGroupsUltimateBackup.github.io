I made two long recordings of the Gyaling from the CD into the PC;<br/>taken from different segments of the recording. Knowing that<br/>woodwinds tend to change pitch as they warm up from being played, I<br/>wanted to take my measurements from separate parts of the ritual, so<br/>as to insure that I was getting the most accurate representation of<br/>the scale pitches.</p><p>2. Chose a timbre that is similar to the Gyaling for the comparison<br/>and tuning.</p><p>3. Using a midi sequencer, I programmed 12 separate tracks, that<br/>could &quot;loop-play&quot; one-at-a-time the 12 tET chromatic scale into the<br/>synth module (this is so I wouldn&apos;t have to use my hands on the<br/>keyboard, thus allowing me to focus on tuning out the beats from the<br/>recording and the synth).</p><p>4. Using an audio editor, I selected small sustained moments of the<br/>scale pitches, and loop-played them along with the sequencer - which<br/>was controlling the synth module.</p><p>5. I would then one-at-a-time un-mute the sequencer tracks while<br/>playing the looped segments of the recording, to determine the<br/>closest 12 tET pitch.</p><p>6. I then tuned out the beats by changing the cents values in the<br/>synth (using a synth editor for this purpose).</p><p>It was very interesting to find that 2 of the scale pitches fell<br/>exactly on Just ratios; 13/12 and 5/3, also that there was a good<br/>approximation of 13/10 as well. Also noteworthy is that there was<br/>inversional symmetry in the 4/3 and 3/2 (approximations) 5 cents flat<br/>and 5 cents sharp respectively; and that there wasn&apos;t a 7th in the<br/>scale. I did take Kraig Grady&apos;s advice - and have only represented<br/>the cents values that I measured, and made no attempt to make it fit<br/>into the Just intervals. In fact, so as to not corrupt what I was<br/>doing, I closed my eyes during the tuning - so that my ear was the<br/>only guide, and when I had the beats tuned out, I would write down<br/>the results. Thanks to everyone for all of the good ideas about how<br/>to do this, and the inspiration to try it myself. As a result of this<br/>endeavor, I now have a template that I can use for this purpose for<br/>future study of scales in recordings.</p><p>Peace,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
