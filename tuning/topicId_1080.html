The<br/>groove is only 1 mm wide and only on one side of the bar.  I use a magnetic<br/>pickup to amplify the vibrations of the bar and the bar has a small<br/>magnetic armature at one end to accomplish this.</p><p>I measured the partials by ear using the frequency generator and counter.</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;Partials(hertz)<br/>Action&#x9;&#x9;1&#x9;2&#x9;Interval (approx)<br/>no groove&#x9;349&#x9;964&#x9;11/4+  (+ meaning slightly sharp)<br/>1mm deep&#x9;345&#x9;966&#x9;7/5<br/>almost 1/2&#x9;329&#x9;966&#x9;11/9-<br/>slightly more&#x9;317&#x9;966&#x9;64/21<br/>end grind&#x9;319&#x9;970</p><p>So you can see that I went slightly to far.  This may be able to be<br/>corrected by grinding from the end, although my first attempt increased the<br/>2nd partial at about the same rate.  The second partial can be flattened by<br/>cutting a groove at its node, although this will probably also effect the<br/>first partial.  Ideally, one would not go to far when cutting the .50<br/>groove.</p><p>I believe that the ancient HP analog frequency generator is starting to<br/>have a shift problem, as I found it very difficult to get a consistent<br/>measurement.  The counter would sometimes shift as much as 3 or 4 hertz<br/>over 30 seconds or so.</p><p>The amplitude of the third partial is insignificant, so I am ignoring it,<br/>and it will probably be even more attenuated by future dampers.</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>South East Just Intonation Society<br/>Gainesville, FL</p></div><h3>Antriasian@xxx.xxx</h3><span>2/27/1999 9:16:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>i have a question for Darren Burgess:</p></div><h3>Antriasian@xxx.xxx</h3><span>2/27/1999 9:19:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>i have a question for Darren Burgess:</p><p>     Exactly how did you mount the aluminum bar for testing??</p><p>     When you refer to using salt or sugar, I can see how  that the node can<br/>be     detected by the area where sugar still remains, but again, how do you<br/>mount the par to preform such a test??</p><p>thanx alot----Anson Antriasian</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/1999 12:37:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:Antriasian@aol.com">Antriasian@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i have a question for Darren Burgess:</p><p>This was my comments not Darrens!</p><p>&gt;      Exactly how did you mount the aluminum bar for testing??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      When you refer to using salt or sugar, I can see how  that the node can<br/>&gt; be     detected by the area where sugar still remains, but again, how do you<br/>&gt; mount the par to preform such a test??</p><p>I just place the bar on some  foam near the modes by eye.

In the golden age of US marimba making, the ideal was to<br/>widen this to a 4/1 ratio and least in the lower octaves.</p><p>In traditional marimba or vibraphone bars, which have the advantage of a<br/>stronger amplitude in the 1st node, lateral modes in the bars often<br/>interfere, as do twists in the grain of wooden bars. These can be adjusted<br/>through notching at an angle in the middle of the bar or by reducing the<br/>width of the bar.</p><p>I&apos;m not certain about this at all, but I believe that the problem with<br/>square bars is that the lateral vibrations are so close to those of the<br/>playing surface that phase interference occurs.</p></div><h3>Darren Burgess &#x3C;dburgess@xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/1999 8:39:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; i have a question for Darren Burgess:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Exactly how did you mount the aluminum bar for testing??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      When you refer to using salt or sugar, I can see how  that the node<br/>can<br/>&gt; be     detected by the area where sugar still remains, but again, how do<br/>you<br/>&gt; mount the par to preform such a test??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; thanx alot----Anson Antriasian<br/>&gt;</p><p>Dear Anson,</p><p>I don&apos;t use salt to test where the node is.  It is very reliably found at<br/>.225 of the total length of the bar, from each end.  Slight variations<br/>don&apos;t make much difference.  I just calculate the point, drill two holes<br/>and it works.</p><p>The mount of the bars is fairly complex, so I don&apos;t care to describe it by<br/>email.  When the instrument is complete I will post pics on a website.</p><p>Darren Burgess</p></div><h3>Darren Burgess &#x3C;dburgess@xxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/1999 9:26:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not certain about this at all, but I believe that the problem with<br/>&gt; square bars is that the lateral vibrations are so close to those of the<br/>&gt; playing surface that phase interference occurs.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Daniel,</p><p>That sounds like a very plausible explanation.  Well, the interesting thing<br/>is that the test bar I just created didn&apos;t have any phase problem (it&apos;s<br/>1/4&quot; square).  Perhaps it is a better machined metal than other stock I<br/>have used.  In addition the manner in which these bars are mounted helps to<br/>dampen the lateral vibrations. (according to the patents).</p><p>By the way, the patents I have are as follows, with a number and brief<br/>review of each.  They illustrate very well the history of  technological<br/>advances in the art/science of metal bar tuning.  Patents can be obtained<br/>through <a href="http://www.uspto.gov">www.uspto.gov</a> for $3 a copy.  Abstract are found at a decent<br/>library, in my case the U. of FL.  Internet info on these is nill as they<br/>are too early--no internet info prior to 1976.  They are wonderful<br/>documents for those of us who haven&apos;t become addicted to the convenience of<br/>synthesizers, tuning tables, and samplers. ;-)</p><p>3048071    Excellent info on getting the first four partials into octave<br/>relationship.  Includes a really cool chart that plots the variation of<br/>frequency of the partials given the location of grooves along the length of<br/>the bar.  (Describes the 5 octave carillon I am restoring/retuning)<br/>2655069   Earlier patent where points on the bar are ground to flatten<br/>partials or crimped perpendicular to the plane of vibration to stiffen the<br/>bar and sharpen the partial.<br/>2606474   Extensively describes the construction and engineering behind a<br/>flemish bell tone instument (I also have 5 octaves of this instrument)<br/>Lots of info in this one.  This instument is quite complex and integrates<br/>several earlier techniques.<br/>2413062  Bell instument that has variable amlitude and frequency control of<br/>the &quot;hum&quot; tone<br/>2703504  Round bar tuning method that involves bending the ends and cutting<br/>grooves<br/>2588295  Ditto<br/>2273333  complex method of bar tuning that involves alot of grooves<br/>throughout  the length of the bar.  This one has almost no detailed<br/>information or measurements, so it is only historically useful.<br/>1632751 A patent referenced by patent 2703504,  I don&apos;t have this one but<br/>it should be useful.</p><p>Perhaps more information (ie hard data and greater detail) can be obtained<br/>on these patents.  Anybody have any ideas?</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>SEJIS-Gainesville, FL</p></div>
