Local harmony is &quot;excellent&quot; (in terms of traditional 1-3-5 triads), but non-local (&gt; 1 octave) harmony is &quot;bizarre&quot; due to lack of octave repeats.</p><p>I&apos;d be curious to know if other people have worked with these non-octave tunings.

In an old post on<br/>tetrachordality, Paul commented on how singers are often off by a fifth in<br/>novice sing-alongs.  True fact.  Also, according to David L.

At the low end<br/>it&apos;s hard to perceive any sense of pitch at all without the help of<br/>overtones.

The first several times I listened to William<br/>Sethares&apos; &quot;October 21st&quot; (with &quot;octaves&quot; stretched to a proportion of 2.1<br/>to 1), it sounded utterly atonal and cacophonous to me. Then one day<br/>something &quot;clicked&quot; and I was able to perceive the individual voices. But I<br/>still don&apos;t perceive anything like octave-equivalence, and I feel no sense<br/>of harmonic progression even though I can mentally reconstruct it by<br/>following the separate voices.
