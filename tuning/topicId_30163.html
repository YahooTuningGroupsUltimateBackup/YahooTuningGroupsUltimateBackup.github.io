This can be seen in the C and F clefs of medieval<br/>staff notation (with G coming into vogue later, in the Renaissance),<br/>and also in the use of keyboard octaves described in terms of C-C, or<br/>sometimes F-F.</p><p>However, as the &quot;center&quot; of a tuning, I would say that D might be more<br/>characteristic.</p><p>Thus in a 12-note tuning of Eb-G# (Pythagorean or meantone, for<br/>example), D is in the middle, since it has 5 fifths below and 6 fifths<br/>above -- or as close to the middle as possible (along with A) in a<br/>tuning with an odd number of fifths.</p><p>In a 17-note tuning of Gb-A#, we find that D has 8 fifths either below<br/>or above it, so that it is squarely in the middle.</p><p>In a 24-note tuning, which I might write as Eb-G#/Eb^-G#^ in a<br/>Pythagorean setting with two manuals a Pythagorean or 64:63 comma<br/>apart (using ^ as a comma sign), or Eb-G#/Eb*-G#* in a meantone or<br/>neo-Gothic eventone temperament (using * as a diesis sign), the system<br/>is typically from my viewpoint two 12-note tunings, with D or D^/D* in<br/>the middle of its respective chain.</p><p>These are the kinds of schemes I&apos;m mostly accustomed to, with D at or<br/>near the &quot;center&quot; of a chain.</p><p>Thus while I tend to make keyboard diagrams with C-C, or F-F, I also<br/>tend to follow the convention of having D around the center of a<br/>chain.</p><p>Of course, style plays a role in this: the medieval and Renaissance<br/>styles which serve as a background for my music feature a variety of<br/>diatonic modes, with modes often &quot;mixed&quot; in a given piece, and with a<br/>range of accidental inflections.</p><p>With Blackjack, I&apos;d say that musical experience might be the best<br/>basis for &quot;standards,&quot; and that historical conventions of the kind<br/>I&apos;ve discussed might or might be that relevant to such a choice of<br/>standards.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
