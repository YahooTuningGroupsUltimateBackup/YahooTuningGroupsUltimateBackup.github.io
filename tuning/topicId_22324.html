It&apos;s official!  No more Opie Taylor epithets thrown at me.</p><p>Actually, I think Baroque music uses a lot of intervals that were intended by the composers to be<br/>7-limit consonances.  Bach and Handel, particularly.  There are a few in late Renaissance and<br/>Classical (strictly speaking) period music , too.  But Baroque seems more replete with them, to<br/>me.  I think it&apos;s always been agreed that Romantic music has many of them, right?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve been meaning to add velocity compression (and other mapping<br/>&gt; options) to my software.  But I also need a &quot;real&quot; sequencing program<br/>&gt; and don&apos;t want to re-invent that wheel.  What do you use and recommend?</p><p>I don&apos;t have experience with too many of them.  In Windows and DOS I&apos;m currently using the<br/>extremely inexpensive, but somewhat clunky, Power Tracks Pro.  Logic and Cakewalk both have very<br/>good reputations and large market share.</p><p>Most any commercial one will offer some way to compress velocities.  It&apos;s usually done by a two<br/>step process: 1) reduce the velocities by a *percentage*, 2) increase them by a correspondingly<br/>appropriate *amount*.  People who use audio gear will recognize those as the Ratio and Gain knobs,<br/>respectively, on an audio compressor.  For instance, if your highest velocity is 127 (the max) and<br/>you want to compress 2:1, reduce them all by 50% then add back 64.  That returns your highest one<br/>to 127 and raises the others half way between where they were and 127.  I found that 33% + 42<br/>worked well for the Bach with my particular synth.  Different units respond differently.</p><p>&gt; &gt;The Chopin is nice, too.  It has its moments.  I think Paul is right<br/>&gt; &gt;about the step sizes in the chromatic passages.
