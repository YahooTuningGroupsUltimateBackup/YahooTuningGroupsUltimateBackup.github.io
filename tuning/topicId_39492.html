The system of quartertones in use is a<br/>modified form of the traditional Tartini microtonal accidentals, as<br/>found in the SCORE notation program which was used for this piece.<br/>(I no longer use SCORE...)</p><p>I have to admit that the violist who played this piece first<br/>concentrated on trying to get the *quartertones* and only later<br/>managed to get the &quot;nuanced&quot; cents microtones, sometimes more<br/>successfully than at other times...</p><p>The other example is a .gif of the *Sims* microtones (there is also<br/>another graphic file in my folder showing Sims accidentals).  The<br/>symbols for that are, of course, only quartertone up, down, sixth-<br/>tone up, down and twelfth tone up, down.  The piece in question is<br/>the cello piece we have been discussing, called _Blacklight_.</p><p>The Sims accidentals *should* make the piece easier to play than the<br/>cents method, with numbers all over the page.  However, Johnny<br/>Reinhard, and possibly others, feels the &quot;hieroglyphic&quot; nature of the<br/>Sims causes &quot;confusion&quot; and player reluctance...</p><p>I have to admit that the reactions to the Sims, commonly used for 72-<br/>tET, have not been all *that* enthusiastic among performers who are<br/>new to this.</p><p>*You* be the judge... :)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
