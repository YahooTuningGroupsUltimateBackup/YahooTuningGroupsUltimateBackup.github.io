She became interested in Carrillo&apos;s music and became a close friend of Carrillo&apos;s daughter Lolita.</p><p>While at a biochemistry meeting in Mexico City in the 1980&apos;s,  I visited the Carrillo home in San Angel, D.F., where saw and noodled on the pianos, and obtained some of Carrillo&apos;s writings.</p><p>Interestingly, I noticed that there was a copy of Novaro&apos;s Sistema Natural de la Musica in Carrillo&apos;s bookshelf. Lolita said that he had interviewed her father, but not credited him in the book. I had not heard about the litigation, but Pat Smith said that there was a lot of polemic in Sonido Trece, most of which she decided to omit in her translation.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3>J.A.Martin Salinas &#x3C;tony@tonysalinas.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2008 10:21:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Pat Smith said that there was a lot of<br/>&gt; polemic in Sonido Trece, most of which she decided to omit in her<br/>&gt; translation.<br/>&gt;<br/>I have almost put together a family tree for the family<br/>with the help of Carrillo&apos;s niece, Carmen, and it will<br/>be easier to track down the available information,<br/>but I guess there must be somebody alive who worked<br/>at the Conservatoire (in Mexico City) and new them both,<br/>and what was going on.</p><p>I can see the clash in their conceptions, but considering<br/>the dimensions of Carrillo&apos;s work it would be more likely<br/>of him looking reacting to the work of Partch than to the<br/>work of Novaro, which I have to say I do not know much<br/>about.</p><p>Tony Salinas</p></div>
