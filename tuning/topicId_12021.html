padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>as far as software synthesis and sampling goes, i gotta put in the good<br/>word for my favorite -- max + msp.  this program is much like csound,<br/>except with a graphical interface (much more intuitive for me), and<br/>realtime-oriented (and not free...).  csound has a bazillion opcodes,<br/>and the kitchen sink, but i think max is a better and more sophisticated<br/>programming language.  max is more or less an object oriented language,<br/>while csound seems barely a language at all!</p><p>and like csound, max is very nuts and bolts --<br/>meaning, you can do just about anything you want, but it might take some work.<br/>msp is the expansion that does digital audio (as opposed to midi).<br/>microtonal work is no problem -- msp does not have any particular tuning<br/>built-in, except a couple of objects that can convert midi note-numbers<br/>to frequency in hertz.  you can do anything you want, microtonally, so long<br/>as you are willing to build the system yourself.</p><p>max/msp has all the sound synthesis and sampling &quot;primitives&quot; needed<br/>to implement just about any technique i&apos;ve heard of.  it has, more or<br/>less, everything csound has.  i&apos;ve been using both, and my ideas<br/>translate pretty easily from one to the other.  since max works in<br/>realtime, i use csound when i want to do something beyond the capabilities<br/>of my computer.  but i try not to do that because max has (for me) a much<br/>faster &quot;turnaround&quot; time for getting a project up and running.  and i<br/>find testing and debugging much easier in max.  currently, max is only<br/>available for macintosh, but they&apos;ve been working on the pc port, and<br/>claim it will be out &quot;before the end of the year&quot;.<br/>(&quot;they&quot; are <a href="http://www.cycling74.com">www.cycling74.com</a>)</p><p>i haven&apos;t used gigasampler, but unless i&apos;m mistaken, it&apos;s in a very<br/>different class of programs.  max and csound are programming languages<br/>for sound, while gigasampler is &quot;just&quot; a sampler -- no programming.<br/>as far as software samplers goes, it looks pretty good.  one could<br/>write a program in max that does the same thing -- plays samples from<br/>file instead of RAM -- but you&apos;d have to code it yourself.  so it<br/>depends on what your priorities and interests are.  hmm, i&apos;m looking<br/>at the gigasampler page now, and i don&apos;t see anything about microtonal<br/>tuning..</p><p>lately i&apos;ve been building a modular &quot;workspace&quot; in max in which i can<br/>call up instances of other programs i&apos;ve made (modules) that do synthesis,<br/>sampling, processing, mixing, etc.  just this afternoon, i&apos;ve been working<br/>on a sample &quot;scrambler&quot;.  you load a soundfile, enter some parameters,<br/>and press the *scramble* button.  the sample is cut into a number of<br/>slices.  pairs of slices might end up swapped in position, some end up<br/>reversed, muted, skipping, etc -- all in realtime.  the idea is to use this<br/>on drumloops.. or anything rhythmic and repeating.  this kind of sample<br/>manipulation is pretty straightforward, once you learn the language.<br/>playback of samples in non-standard tunings is straightforward.</p><p>on my list of things to do is something microtonal-oriented.  i&apos;m saving<br/>that until *after* i have enough sound generating modules.  i&apos;d like to<br/>write a little program that can load tuning information from Scala files.<br/>once the files are loaded, the user could select tunings from a menu<br/>and play them via a midi keyboard, or a midi-file, or (my main goal),<br/>max programs that generate streams of note events algorithmically.<br/>such an algorithmic note-generator could be made intelligent enough to<br/>understand the features of the particular tuning being used.  another<br/>obvious possibility is switching between tunings on-the-fly, or perhaps<br/>&quot;morphing&quot; from one tuning to another.  all of this will take some time<br/>and work, but i don&apos;t foresee any major problems.</p><p>anyway, for microtonal work (and any other kind of computer music for<br/>that matter), there&apos;s nothing i like more.  that&apos;s my plug. :)</p><p>pfly</p><p>--<br/>P a u l  F l y<br/><a href="http://www.neuron.net/~pfly">http://www.neuron.net/~pfly</a></p></div><h3><a id=12032 href="#12032">ðŸ”—</a>phv40@hotmail.com</h3><span>8/29/2000 3:02:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
