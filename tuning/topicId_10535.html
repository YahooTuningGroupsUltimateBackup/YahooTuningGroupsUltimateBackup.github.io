I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t have to<br/>think about constructing the mapping file in the first place... maybe<br/>later when I&apos;m more &quot;comfortable&quot; with this... (gulp)</p><p>I have to admit one must &quot;watch out&quot; for the keyboard pitch &quot;E&quot; in these<br/>scales... it isn&apos;t mapped and sounds a &quot;blooper...&quot; but, there we go<br/>with the KEYBOARD again!</p><p>Oh, and to Paul Erlich... I wanted to mention that, no, there certainly<br/>is no problem with the density of your article.  The &quot;density&quot; simply<br/>resided in the mind of the reader... something I&apos;m hoping to soon<br/>remedy!<br/>_____________ ________ ____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
