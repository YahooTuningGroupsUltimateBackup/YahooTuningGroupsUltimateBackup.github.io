I&apos;ll briefly<br/>mention here some things I found when doing additive analysis of<br/>recorded musical sounds in the early 1990s which may be of interest to you.</p><p>In 1990 I developed an additive analysis system which could be applied<br/>to digitized recorded sounds.  I first did a frequency analysis on the<br/>sound yielding a frequency vs time trajectory.  I then did a modified<br/>Fourier analysis on the sound, taking for current window analysis frequency<br/>that read from the previously determined frequency vs time trajectory.<br/>I did a frequency analysis on a trombone Ab3 note and found the frequency<br/>trajectory to have a lot of &quot;wobble&quot;.  If I did the analysis assuming<br/>a frequency approximately at Ab1, two octaves below the heard pitch of<br/>that note, I obtained a smoother frequency trajectory.  I did additive<br/>analyses for the two cases: (1) assuming the frequency trajectory<br/>obtained for Ab3 and (2) assuming that obtained for Ab1.  Both analyses<br/>yielded the amplitude and frequency trajectories for a series of partials<br/>having 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. times the frequency of Ab3.  However, in addition,<br/>there were additional weak partials having 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, etc.<br/>times the frequency of Ab1.  I resynthesized sounds based on both the<br/>analysis<br/>on Ab3 and that on Ab1.  Both closely resembled the original recorded<br/>trombone note, but the resynthesis on Ab1 had a kind of breathy &quot;presence&quot;<br/>which made it seem almost indistinguishable from the original recorded note.<br/>Thus I concluded that some sounds produced by musical instruments, certainly<br/>horns, may contain a &quot;subfundamental&quot; at 1/2 or 1/3 or 1/4, etc. the<br/>frequency of<br/>the nominal fundamental and faint overtones of this &quot;subfundamental&quot;.</p><p>I analyzed voice sung notes and often found a weak subfundamental an octave<br/>below<br/>the apparent fundamental.  Basing analysis on the subfundamental usually<br/>yielded<br/>a more realistic additive resynthesis of the sound.  I analyzed the notes C4,<br/>F4,<br/>Bb4, Eb5, and Ab5 sung by a soprano voice student singing the vowel sound<br/>&quot;ah&quot;.<br/>There was a prominent subfundamental at C3 for her lowest sung note, which<br/>had<br/>a rather breathy character.  I believe I recall there being a weaker<br/>subfundamental<br/>for her F4, while for the higher notes the subfundamental was scarcely<br/>detectable.</p><p>I did not pursue the question of determining the physical explanation for<br/>there<br/>being subfundamentals, but given the physics of standing waves in cavities<br/>such as<br/>horns, it seems plausible that there should be faint vibrations at one half<br/>or<br/>possibly another submultiple of the fundamental frequency.</p><p>Dave Hill     La Mesa, CA</p></div>
