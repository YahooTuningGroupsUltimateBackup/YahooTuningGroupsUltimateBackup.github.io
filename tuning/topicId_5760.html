In central Javanese Slendro -- which is close to 5tet<br/>and where the pitches within an octave are numbered 12356 with &quot;fifths&quot;<br/>ordered 1-5-2-6-3-1 --  players use pitch three as both the &quot;fifth&quot; above<br/>pitch six and the &quot;fifth&quot; below pitch one, thus compounding the 81/64 and 4/3<br/>implications.  The gongsmith has to temper his tuning so that both functions<br/>can be covered within reasonable tolerance, while the players of instruments<br/>without fixed pitches find a variety of ways to nuance the relationship.  In<br/>_gender_ playing, the 6-3 interval is less critical in that it does not<br/>function as _seleh_  (the &quot;goal&quot; interval of a gender pattern), so that there<br/>may be a bias in the tuning towards the the 3-1 interval.</p><p>A characteristic by-product of this tempered pythagorean cycle of five is the<br/>introduction of melodic steps close to the septimal intervals 8/7 and 7/6.</p></div>
