It&apos;s still available on my web page, at the bottom.<br/>It makes its tuning decisions solely upon the set of notes playing at<br/>any given moment in time, and centers tuning deviation around an average<br/>of zero compared to 12-tET.

What things do your input parameters adjust?<br/>Could you share output tuning values in cents and/or midi files?  How<br/>do you deal with transitions, where the old chord overlaps the new<br/>slightly?  That&apos;s another type of challenge, BTW, that is VERY difficult<br/>for real-time software, IMO, especially in limits beyond 5.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
