That was just<br/>as well, since the progression was wrong anyway.</p><p>However, *now* it&apos;s been corrected and is in the files area under my<br/>Pehrson directory. (Blackjack progression1.mp3)</p><p>Again it is the following (it *really* is this time, I promise):</p><p>The &quot;magic&quot; chord G:Bv:F:Db^ in a &quot;tilted square&quot; shape (what is that<br/>called?)</p><p>Followed, and connected to the parallelogram by two common tones:</p><p>F:Db^:C:Ab^</p><p>Which shares, then, three pitches with the utonal tetrad:</p><p>F:C:Ab^:D&gt;</p><p>And finally resolves and shares two common tones with the &quot;real&quot; (I<br/>shouldda heard that) otonal tetrad:</p><p>C:D&gt;:Gb^:A&gt;</p><p>This is really a great progression.  In fact, it&apos;s the first one I&apos;m<br/>*really* excited about.  (It&apos;s even *more* exciting without<br/>the &quot;errors...&quot; :) )</p><p>Could it be, possibly, because I&apos;m varying the *shapes* on the<br/>lattice, and not just connecting utonal and otonal tetrads like I was<br/>before?  Possibly.  Maybe there&apos;s more variety in the connections<br/>that way... ??</p><p>In any case, I was trying to even extend this one further to a 8-note<br/>progression using similar procedures... and possibly if I&apos;m still<br/>excited about it, I will post that one tomorrow...</p><p>Thanks to everybody for the very distinguished hearing!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
