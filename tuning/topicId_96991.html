Say the scale contains a 9/8 and a 7/5. The distance between them is 56/45 (378.60219 cents) which is not a good harmony interval. 56/45 is 7.71152 cents away from a 5/4 (386.31371 cents) interval. 7.71152 cents is greater than the &quot;maximum deviation from just&quot; (6.7758758 cents) so 56/45 is not a good harmony interval and is not close enough to a 5/4 interval to be good.</p><p>We could temper the 7/5 and raise it by, say, 3 cents so now the distance between 9/8 and the tempered 7/5 is 381.60219 cents which is within 6.776 cents of a 5/4 (386.31371 cents) interval. So now the 9/8 and tempered 7/5 &quot;meet&quot; (or &quot;kiss&quot;) forming a good harmony interval (an approximate 5/4).</p><p>When tempering a just scale where all the notes paired with the tonic form sweet (2/x + 2/y &gt;= 0.25) melodic intervals, each note should be tempered by not more than +/-6.7758758 cents (a kiss).</p><p>The origin of the kiss is based on an educated guess backed up with listening tests. The educated guess has to do with the fact that powers of 2 occur a lot in my research and seem significant. 256 is 2 to the power of 8.</p><p>John.</p><p><a href="http://www.johnsmusic7.com">http://www.johnsmusic7.com</a></p></div>
