This shows, incidentally,<br/>that omega squared is just omega itself - that<br/>is, that your doubly infinite scale is no &quot;bigger&quot;<br/>than a singly infinite scale.</p><p>Could you please give an example of the sort of<br/>doubly infinite scale you had in mind?  Your<br/>later comments on &quot;density&quot; suggest you may<br/>have been thinking of a continuum, rather than<br/>a countable infinity.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.322 / Virus Database: 266.11.13 - Release Date: 19/5/05</p></div>
