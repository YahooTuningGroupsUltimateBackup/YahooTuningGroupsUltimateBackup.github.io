So, here we go...</p><p>Imagine this scene: you&apos;re at a party.  A lovely young woman arrives,<br/>and somehow you find yourself in conversation with her, and somehow it<br/>comes around to tuning, and she asks, &quot;But isn&apos;t equal temperament the<br/>perfect way to tune?  Why would you want to change it?&quot;.  Are you ready?<br/>Could grab a calculator and dazzle her with math?</p><p>Or are you left stammering?  Dont&apos;cha HATE it when that happens?  Well,<br/>now you can be math literate, because Uncle John has prepared...</p><p>BASIC TUNING MATH: converting frequency ratios to cents and back</p><p>A conceptual introduction to logarithms</p><p>The piano provides the perfect model, as well as an illustration of why<br/>we have to do these transformations.  On the one hand there is the row<br/>of strings: with each octave higher, the frequency doubles, from A440 to<br/>880 to 1760 hertz (cycles/second) as we go up to higher A&apos;s; 220, 110,<br/>and 55 hertz as we go down to lower A&apos;s.  On the other hand, the keys<br/>move in linear progression, twelve semitones per octave.</p><p>Logs are a mathematical way of relating doubling to linear motion.<br/>Exponents (powers) go the other way, relating linear motion to doubling.</p><p>Whenever the whole process gets confusing, think of the piano.  But,<br/>even if you&apos;re lost or indifferent so far, you can still do</p><p>The math</p><p>First you need a calculator with logs and exponents.  A key might be<br/>labeled &quot;log&quot; or &quot;ln&quot; (for log natural).  The other key we want is<br/>something like &quot;X^Y&quot;, where Y is probably a superscript to X, indicating<br/>that the key will raise X to the Y power.</p><p>Don&apos;t have a calculator with those keys?  Get down to the store and buy<br/>one!  They&apos;re cheap.  Yes, you did vow most solemnly you&apos;d never own<br/>anything of the sort, but holding out this long is enough to have made<br/>your point.  Now buy (or borrow) one.</p><p>Let&apos;s walk through some basic calculations.  You gotta get this to work<br/>before we can go on.  Confess your lack of knowledge to someone who<br/>might know, if you&apos;re stuck.</p><p>Raise 2.0 to the 3.0 power; get 8.0.  I wish I could help you with more<br/>specific instructions, but calculators are all different.</p><p>Next exercise: divide the log of 1.5 by the log of 2.  It&apos;ll go one of<br/>two ways:</p><p>   If your calculator uses natural logs:</p><p>      log(1.5)             = 0.4055<br/>      log(2.0)             = 0.6931<br/>      log(1.5) / log(2.0)  = 0.5850</p><p>   If your calculator uses base 10 logs:</p><p>      log(1.5)             = 0.1761<br/>      log(2.0)             = 0.3010<br/>      log(1.5) / log(2.0)  = 0.5850</p><p>Note that the final answer comes out the same, so it doesn&apos;t matter;<br/>we&apos;re actually calculating &quot;log to base 2&quot; by either path.  By the way,<br/>0.5850 happens to be the fraction of an octave representing a perfect<br/>fifth (frequency ratio 1.5).</p><p>Cents review: a cent is a measure defined to be 1/100 of a 12 tone<br/>equal temperament semitone.  So, a cent is 1/1200 of an octave.</p><p>Now you&apos;re ready!</p><p>To convert frequency ratio to cents interval:</p><p>   Delta_cents = 1200 x log(freq_ratio) / log(2)</p><p>OK, walk thru with an example: a major third, a 5/4 ratio, divides out<br/>to 1.25 frequency ratio; take the log of that; take the log of 2 and<br/>divide; you should see 0.3219 (if your calculator displays intermediate<br/>results); multiply by 1200 and get 386.31 cents (compare with 400 cents<br/>for a major third in 12-tET).</p><p>To convert cents interval to frequency ratio:</p><p>   Freq_ratio = 2 ^ (delta_cents / 1200)</p><p>That&apos;s &quot;two to the power&quot;.  Again, do an example: a 12-tET minor third,<br/>3 semitones or 300 cents, divided by 1200 gives 0.25 (octaves).  Two<br/>(2.0) raised to that power gives 1.1892; compare to 1.2000 for a perfect<br/>6/5 minor third ratio.</p><p>You are SO cool.  Put a mortar board on your head!</p><p>Note that everything we&apos;ve talked about relates TWO notes.  A single<br/>note in space, such as A440, may be a starting point for forming<br/>intervals, but there&apos;s little we can do with it by itself.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
