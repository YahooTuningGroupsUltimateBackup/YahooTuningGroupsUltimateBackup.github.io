The first is my chapter &quot;Introduction to<br/>&gt;Sound Design with Csound&quot;.  As you will see, in itself this is an entire 12<br/>&gt;week software synthesis curriculum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The second chapter is a CD-ROM chapter by Kim Cascone  entitled<br/>&gt;&quot;Recontextualizing Ambient Music with Csound&quot;.  His chapter is the perfect<br/>&gt;companion to mine.  He focuses on moving from sound design to composition<br/>&gt;and documents the process beautifully.  And both of these chapters, by the<br/>&gt;way, are filled with block diagrams and are fully linked to the html<br/>&gt;reference manual.  Of course, they include zip files of all orchestras,<br/>&gt;scores and samples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Also, when you click on the Csound Book button (you know... the red one)<br/>&gt;you will get to check out the cover to the Csound Book.  It was created by<br/>&gt;award winning graphic designer Ori Kometani.  You might  appreciate the<br/>&gt;fact that she had taken one of the Csound instruments from my chapter on<br/>&gt;Sound Design and converted it into a swirling pattern.  For someone that<br/>&gt;has never used Csound before, I think she has perfectly captured the<br/>&gt;essance of the program... it turns text into beautiful waveforms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The third chapter is also from the CD-ROM.  On The MIT Csound FrontPage<br/>&gt;this appears as a new &quot;Universities&quot; button.  Of course, I started by<br/>&gt;featuring the music by some of my students at Berklee. Many of them have<br/>&gt;helped with the Csound Book and I owe them very much for their dedication<br/>&gt;and sacrifice.  I hope you like their music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hey?  Do you teach a course in Csound at your university?  If the answer is<br/>&gt;YES.  Please use this as a model and send me your student works so that I<br/>&gt;can post them on the site here at MIT.  It would be great to find out where<br/>&gt;Csound is being taught and what the students are doing.  On the CD-ROM<br/>&gt;several other universities are featured: Bowling Green, LSU, Glasgow. In<br/>&gt;fact, I haven&apos;t burnt the CD yet. So, if you get me the materials in the<br/>&gt;next two weeks, I might be able to add your university program to the<br/>&gt;CD-ROM in addition to posting it on the MIT site.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I will keep you posted on the progress of The Csound Book.  MIT Press tells<br/>&gt;me that it is currently being typeset  and I should have the pageproofs in<br/>&gt;about a week.  I plan to have a reading party here at my home with all my<br/>&gt;student assistants reading and re-reading all the chapters to make sure<br/>&gt;there are no mistakes.  Then it is off to the printers.... You may be able<br/>&gt;to order copies in June... That is the hope.  Well see.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For now, I hope you will appreciate all the work that my INCREDIBLE<br/>&gt;assistant Jacob Joaquin has done to build, maintain and now redesign the<br/>&gt;MIT Csound FrontPage.  He is totally committed to keeping it up to date and<br/>&gt;continually improving it.  He and I both would appreciate any suggestions<br/>&gt;and feedback... We would especially appreciate contributions to the FAQ and<br/>&gt;the Universities sections.  And of course we want to hear your music!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Have a great spring. Enjoy the Matrix and Star Wars Episode 1 and then get<br/>&gt;ready for the Summer of Csound.  I can&apos;t wait until you all get to check<br/>&gt;out the wonderful instruments and chapters that the contributers have<br/>&gt;written for The Csound Book.  The two that I have included on the MIT<br/>&gt;Csound FrontPage are just appetizers... the main course is on its way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yours Sincerely,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Richard Boulanger<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;_____________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;Dr. Richard Boulanger<br/>&gt;Professor - Music Synthesis Department<br/>&gt;Berklee College of Music<br/>&gt;1140 Boylston Street  - Boston, MA  02215-3693<br/>&gt;Office Phone: (617) 747-2485   Office Fax: (617) 536-2257<br/>&gt;Email: <a href="mailto:radiobaton@earthlink.net">radiobaton@earthlink.net</a>  OR  <a href="mailto:rboulanger@berklee.edu">rboulanger@berklee.edu</a><br/>&gt;_____________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;Personal Webpage: <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~radiobaton/">http://home.earthlink.net/~radiobaton/</a><br/>&gt;THE Csound Frontpage: <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/csound/frontpage.html">http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/csound/frontpage.html</a><br/>&gt;HTML Tools &amp; Tips: <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~richardboulanger/btot99.html">http://members.tripod.com/~richardboulanger/btot99.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
