That of: You<br/>feel that there is a certain Prime Limit beyond which we would tend<br/>to interpret the intervals as lower number integer ratios. I believe<br/>it was the 13 Prime Limit (correct me if wrong). Please explain what<br/>led you to this realization about this perceptual limit. And perhaps<br/>why it may be important to establish a limit that is not exceeded in<br/>the construction of a scale system.</p><p>I should admit here that I frequently cross this line. Perhaps even<br/>this would be a good topic for research: To &quot;A&amp;B&quot; some<br/>chords/progressions from higher and lower limits (for which the<br/>higher may perceived as lower), than the limit you have said, just to<br/>hear if there is any significantly difference between them. Could be<br/>very interesting as well.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Jacky</p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2000 2:41:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacky Ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ekstasis@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12456">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12456</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...

I can see that you do consider a much broader palette from<br/>&gt; your post. Thanks for the clarification. I found this chapter of<br/>&gt; your book particularly interesting.</p><p>Oh....OK, Jacky.  Thanks for pinpointing the info in my book.<br/>Now I can answer you specifically on that point.</p><p>What I developed there was the idea that in traditional &apos;common-<br/>practice&apos; harmonic theory, chord-members are stacked in &apos;3rds&apos;,<br/>but that after the &apos;13th&apos;, the cycle returns back to the origin,<br/>i.e., the &apos;15th&apos; = the &apos;double 8ve&apos;.</p><p>As you (and probably everyone else on this List) well know, this<br/>is not necessarily the case with just-intonation.  A 5-limit<br/>system can build chords out of just-tuned &apos;major-&apos; and &apos;minor-3rds&apos;<br/>(5/4s and 6/5s) in the same way.</p><p>But if one&apos;s JI system follows the harmonic series strictly into<br/>higher prime- or odd-limits, the &apos;3rds&apos; get progessively smaller,<br/>so that, in an otonality for instance, after the 13th harmonic,<br/>the 15th harmonic is *not* a return to the origin, but rather<br/>an entirely new form of &apos;7th&apos; (the &apos;major 7th&apos;, whereas the 7th<br/>harmonic is closer to a &apos;minor 7th&apos;).</p><p>Similarly, if one builds a JI system up to the 31st harmonic,<br/>again the 29th harmonic will be a kind of &apos;minor 7th&apos; and the<br/>31st will sound like either a wide &apos;major 7th&apos; or a narrowed<br/>&apos;8ve&apos;.</p><p>And what I noticed about this was the traditional harmonic<br/>prescription that &apos;major&apos; and &apos;minor&apos; intervals are not used<br/>simultaneously, which seemed to have an echo in JI in that<br/>a nice typically tonal chord would have a &apos;7th&apos; that can be<br/>any one out of the set of 7th, 15th, 29th, or 31st harmonics,<br/>but not more than one of them together.</p><p>Now of course, lots of music has been written that doesn&apos;t<br/>follow this &apos;rule&apos; at all - some of it by me :)  There&apos;s no<br/>reason why any set of tones can&apos;t be used, if it sounds right<br/>or suits the compositional purpose.</p><p>But I did think that there was a very interesting parallel<br/>with traditional theory there, and so I felt this observation<br/>was a sort of vindication of my prior idea that 13 is a kind<br/>of limit.</p><p>So, that fleshes out a bit what I wrote in my book.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Many Greek theorists were firm believers in the need for all<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios in a tetrachord to be superparticular.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m very aware of Ptolemy.</p><p>But there were *lots* of others!  Many of them are in my book too:<br/>Eratosthenes, Didymus, etc.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2000 8:26:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;josephpehrson@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12464">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12464</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Joe...
