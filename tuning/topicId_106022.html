Let&apos;s find the mistuning in the following factors: 2/1, 3/1, 5/1, 3/2, 5/2, 5/3.</p><p>In the first case, we have the following comma fractions:</p><p>0, -1/4, 0, -1/4, 0, 1/4</p><p>For our second example, we get:</p><p>0, -1/3, -1/3, -1/3, -1/3, 0</p><p>And finally, we have:</p><p>0, -2/7, -1/7, -2/7, -1/7, 1/7</p><p>The sum of absolute errors is therefore 3/4, 4/3, or 1 comma, respectively.</p><p>According to this type of measurement, 1/4-comma meantone should be more &quot;in tune&quot; than 2/7-comma. But this omits the fact that only 2 of the 6 factors have the highest error in 2/7-comma meantone while in 1/4-comma meantone there are 3 of them. This becomes even more noticeable when I compare just 3 factors (3/1, 5/1, 5/3), only one of which has the highest error in 2/7-comma meantone.</p><p>This raises several questions:</p><p>1) What other procedure for finding a generator should we choose (I&apos;ve excluded minimax tuning right now) if we want the lowest non-zero absolute error to be the lowest possible and also to appear in as many intervals as possible?</p><p>2) How should we apply this consideration in the case of tempered octaves?</p><p>Any suggestions or comments will be highly appreciated.</p><p>Petr</p><p>&#x3000;</p></div><h3><a id=106023 href="#106023">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2013 12:02:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>What are your desiderata here?

But for non-tempered octaves, the lowest non-zero error always appears more than once if I compare 3/1, 5/1 and 5/3. And I think this should be one of the criteria. Of course, the error appears twiceeven in 1/4-comma meantone, but it isn&apos;t the lowest possible one (i.e. 1/4-comma) compared to the lowest error in 2/7-comma meantone (only 1/7-comma). This indicates to me that now we have one more requirement -- that one of the errors appearing more than once should be the lowest possible non-zero value.</p><p>It seems to me that both of these requirements should be met. Because if I went for, let&apos;s say, 1/11-comma meantone, then the error in the 3/1 is tiny but it appears just once, which makes the other two errors (in 5/1 and 5/3) meaninglessly high.</p><p>Hope my words are understandable.</p><p>Petr</p><p>&#x3000;</p></div><h3><a id=106026 href="#106026">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2013 10:39:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Petr,</p><p>Not sure I&apos;m following your inquiry.

Graham wrote the original paper on it<br/>here, calling it TOP-RMS: <a href="http://x31eq.com/primerr.pdf">http://x31eq.com/primerr.pdf</a> . The Wiki has<br/>good information as well, under the &quot;Tenney-Euclidean tuning&quot;<br/>sections.</p><p>It&apos;s all quite abstract and mathematical, and Graham&apos;s done the work<br/>by coding it up on his temperament finder anyway. So, you need to ask<br/>yourself: is your goal really to understand and code up an<br/>implementation of the algorithm yourself? If so, I can help walk you<br/>through it, but if not, you might be happy just to use what the<br/>temperament finder spits out.</p><p>So you at least understand the basic goal of the whole procedure, for<br/>prime-limits, the approach is essentially as follows:<br/>1) For any tuning of your temperament, compute the tuning of each<br/>prime. This set of prime tunings is called the &quot;tuning map&quot; for the<br/>temperament.<br/>2) Subtract the tempered primes from their idealized JI equivalents<br/>and take the absolute value to come up with the &quot;error&quot; for that<br/>prime.<br/>3) Take the root-mean-squared of all of the prime errors. This is the<br/>&quot;RMS error&quot; for that tuning.<br/>4) Find the tuning map supporting your temperament which has RMS error<br/>as low as mathematically possible.<br/>5) This tuning map has the magical &quot;minimizing average error over all<br/>intervals&quot; properties that I mentioned before, where &quot;all intervals&quot;<br/>is formulated as that one specific limit I mentioned.</p><p>#4 is the nontrivial step which is made easy if you have a good<br/>pseudoinverse routine. But again, you don&apos;t need to reinvent the wheel<br/>because Graham&apos;s already done the work on his temperament finder. For<br/>instance, here&apos;s 5-limit meantone:<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=12_19&limit=5">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=12_19&limit=5</a> . Note that it says</p><p>Tuning Map (cents)<br/>&lt;1201.397, 1898.446, 2788.196]</p><p>This is, in fact, the TE tuning for meantone. Done! You read this<br/>tuning map as though it were a val with real coefficients, so in this<br/>case the first one is the tuning for 2/1, the second is the tuning for<br/>3/1, and the last is the tuning for 5/1. Note that octaves are detuned<br/>as well, so that error is spread out along the octaves too.</p><p>To compute the POTE tuning instead of the TE tuning, you want to scale<br/>the whole thing linearly so that the first coefficient becomes<br/>1200.000. So in this case, multiply the whole map by<br/>1200.000/1201.397, and you get &lt;1200.000 1896.238 2784.954|. This is<br/>the POTE tuning, easy.</p><p>TOP is similar, except you can think of it as minimizing maximum error<br/>rather than average error. It strives to make the worst-case detuning<br/>as palatable as possible. TE, in contrast, is better at spreading the<br/>error out as evenly as possible. In practice they both almost always<br/>agree very closely, to within a few cents, so it&apos;s not worth really<br/>agonizing over.</p><p>A final caveat: Graham&apos;s code currently doesn&apos;t compute the TE tuning<br/>properly for subgroup temperaments. If you want to compute it for<br/>subgroup temperaments, just compute it for the full-limit version<br/>instead with the same kernel and then throw the extra intervals away.<br/>So for instance, if you want to work out the TE tuning for the<br/>2.9/7.5/3 245/243 temperament, which is basically a subgroup version<br/>of sensi, just use the temperament finder to compute it for the<br/><a href="http://2.3.5.7">2.3.5.7</a> 245/243 temperament instead, and then throw away the intervals<br/>you don&apos;t want.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Mon, Apr 8, 2013 at 5:15 AM, Petr Pa&rcaron;&iacute;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Mike,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; can you give an example of the procedure, one with pure octaves and one<br/>&gt; without?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr</p></div><h3><a id=106032 href="#106032">ðŸ”—</a>petrparizek2000 &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2013 10:25:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Mike.</p><p>Thanks for the description.

Yes, I was making a small utility for Microsoft QuickBasic (still under MSDos) that could generate pitch sequences for triadic comma pumps (you just type in the ratio and it does all the rest for you). And if the tempering is to be the least possible, then the steps are as follows:</p><p>#1. Find the logarithmic size of the interval which will be tempered out (i.e. for meantone, it&apos;s ~21.506 cents).</p><p>#2. Find the exponents of the 3 ratios in question. If the ratios are 2/1, 3/1, 5/1, then the exponents are -4, 4, -1.</p><p>#3. Find their absolute values and add them up. You get 9. Divide the comma size by 9 and you get the required amount of tempering.</p><p>#4. Make a sequence of 4 falling octaves, 4 rising 12ths, 1 major 17th, in an order of your choice (I usually try to minimize the repetitions of one ratio more times in a row so I would probably alternate between 12ths and octaves). You end up a comma higher.</p><p>#5. Shift each consecutive pitch down by the resulting tempering amount. You end up where you started. If you add or subtract a proper number of octaves for each of the 9 pitches, you end up with a pentatonic scale because the 4 other pitches are octave equivalents of some other ones.</p><p>I&apos;m sending a link to one of my experimental results from 2011. Here the vanishing interval is the schisma but the 3 ratios change from case to case. They are labeled by letters from A to F, meaning 2/1, 3/1, 3/2, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, respectively.</p><p>BTW: Sorry for the &quot;0&quot; before the prime exponents; the program was originally intended for something else and I didn&apos;t want to rewrite too much of it.</p><p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8497979/CPLIST_SCHISMA.TXT">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8497979/CPLIST_SCHISMA.TXT</a></p><p>Petr</p><p>&#x3000;</p></div><h3><a id=106055 href="#106055">ðŸ”—</a>Glenn &#x3C;glenn.leider@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2013 9:44:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;marcel@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Btw, you can then click on &quot;approximate form&quot; under &quot;real solutions&quot; at<br/>&gt; the wolfram alpha results.<br/>&gt; And then click &quot;more digits&quot; and then &quot;A -&gt; copyable plaintext&quot; and then<br/>&gt; copy the text and input it in a ratio to cents converter like<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-centsratio.htm">http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-centsratio.htm</a> and then you&apos;ll<br/>&gt; have your value in cents.<br/>&gt; Which is only 0.139551484857567 cents in the below example.
