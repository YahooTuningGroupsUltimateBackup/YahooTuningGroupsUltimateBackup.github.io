The CD that comes with the book has numerous tracks of<br/>sound recordings of both birds and insects.<br/>    Dunn writes of Track 23, &quot;Yakushima Forest, Japan: Insects and Birds&quot;:</p><p>    &gt; &gt;&quot;This exquiste recording of a Japanese forest soundscape is not only<br/>provocative for the beauty of the nature sounds but also for how it is<br/>suggestive of aspects of Japanese culture. I hear things in this recording<br/>that are so much a part of how I think about traditional Japan. The sense of<br/>time, its slow pulse and purposefulness, is directly evocative of Japanese<br/>music such as Gagaku. In fact, Japanese musicians claim that the the<br/>relationship is the other way around: the music evolved from meditative<br/>listening to nature....&quot;&lt; &lt;</p><p>    I hear an amazing variety of &quot;higher intervals&quot; in insect soundscape<br/>&quot;songs,&quot; i.e. tropical rainforest recordings --- esp&apos;ly &quot;lower-case-sound&quot;<br/>drones (Hmm, I also wonder if Ligeti gets some of his polymicrotonal timbral<br/>ideas/inspiration from insects? Perhaps even Crumb... I think Tan Dun in his<br/>more experimental chamber ensemble pieces has the &quot;insect influence&quot; as well.<br/>Mayhaps dronality did evolve from insect song much like melody perhaps<br/>evolved from bird song...)</p><p>        Stillness -<br/>    the cicada&apos;s cry<br/>        drills into the rocks.</p><p>                        ~ Basho</p><p>    Insect song seems to be a _high cultural_ East Asian obsession. I possess<br/>a book on it: _Insect Musicians and Cricket Champions: A Cultural History of<br/>Singing Insects in China and Japan_ by Lisa Gail Ryan (China Books, 1996,<br/>ISBN 0-8351-2576-9).<br/>It has great illustrations and colour photographs besides more info on insect<br/>song and the aesthetics of its appreciation (for more scientific treatments<br/>ya on your own, hehe).</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang, the &quot;Yves Klein Bleu Aardvark&quot;</p><p>&quot;I have the feeling that the English word &apos;noise&apos; has more negative<br/>connotations than our German word &apos;Gerausch&apos;.  We would describe the sound of<br/>wind blowing as Gerausch, to imply that it&apos;s a beautiful and natural sound.<br/>It&apos;s so stupid when people say that instead of making beautiful sounds, I<br/>make noise...I like these sounds and this has nothing to do with<br/>&apos;anti-beauty&apos;&quot; - Helmut Lachenmann</p><p>&quot;We cannot doubt that animals both love and practice music. That is evident.<br/>But it seems their musical system differs from ours. It is another<br/>school...We are not familiar with their didactic works. Perhaps they don&apos;t<br/>have any.&quot;  - Erik Satie</p><p>NADA BRAHMA - Sanskrit, &quot;sound [is the] Godhead&quot;<br/>LILA - Sanskrit, &quot;divine play/sport/whimsy&quot; - &quot;the universe is what happens<br/>when God wants to play&quot; - &quot;joyous exercise of spontaneity involved in the art<br/>of creation&quot;</p></div>
