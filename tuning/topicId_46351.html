Pitch Bending is a<br/>MIDI function which allows a note to be &quot;bent&quot; (pitch shifted up or<br/>down), in real time. Pitch Bend MIDI messages cause all the<br/>notes on that channel to be shifted up or down a specified<br/>amount. The pitch bend is specified as a 14-bit number, using<br/>two 7-bit bytes. This results in 16,384 pitch steps being<br/>available. The availability of 16,384 steps can produce pitch<br/>bends which are completely smooth to the human ear (even<br/>though they are carried out in discrete steps). It should also be<br/>noted that Pitch Bend commands are standard within the MIDI<br/>interface.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>14 bit pitch bend results in 98304/12 = 8192 steps per halfstep,<br/>not 16384.</p><p>&lt;&lt;[0071] The proposed invention implements notes which do<br/>not lie on the traditional Western semitone scale using the<br/>following method: First, a standard note lying on the Western<br/>scale is played. Then, a Polyphonic Aftertouch signal is<br/>immediately sent to shift the pitch of the standard note to<br/>transform it into a non-standard note. The Polyphonic Aftertouch<br/>message follows immediately behind the Note On message<br/>and pitch value creating the standard note. Thus, the standard<br/>note only sounds for about 960 microseconds. The shortest<br/>temporal resolution of the human ear is approximately 2-3<br/>milliseconds. As a result, the human ear does not hear the first<br/>standard note, since it does not sound for a sufficient length of<br/>time. The human ear only perceives the pitch shifted note. &gt;&gt;</p><p>MIDI is serial and it&apos;s clunky; I&apos;m afraid that the above claim is<br/>indefensible in practice...</p><p>All other qualms aside, using aftertouch has been tried before<br/>for various tuning purposes, but the question remains in this<br/>patent : how, specifically, is the retuning accomplished? It<br/>doesn&apos;t really say. It implies something like sysex because<br/>apparently every pitch can be retuned. Is the suggestion really<br/>that new hardware should interpret aftertouch messages as<br/>tuning messages? How is this an improvement over sysex? Is<br/>the suggestion to change the MIDI protocol? A tuning box would<br/>apparently be built. What messages does it send to retune?<br/>Sorry, I must have missed something.</p><p>Aaron</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2003 12:15:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/jiqk?___aftertouch_retuning_patent">http://tinyurl.com/jiqk?___aftertouch_retuning_patent</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Comments?</p><p>Just a note -- this is a patent application.
