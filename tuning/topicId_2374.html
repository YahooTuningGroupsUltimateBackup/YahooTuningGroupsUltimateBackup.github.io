Among his many interests,<br/>microtonal music was specifically mentioned. Does anyone know of his<br/>work in our area? Blackwood is also at Chicago, BTW.</p><p>McCawley is best known as the creator of &quot;generative semantics,&quot; a<br/>theory which became inintentional construed as a challenge to Chomsky,<br/>McCawley&apos;s former teacher.</p><p>As for my lattices, I&apos;m still experimenting, but I thought the early<br/>results interesting enough to release. I tend to agree that trying to<br/>show both the sizes (in cents) of the intervals and their harmonic<br/>relations on the same diagram is confusing. I might add that I use<br/>octave reduced intervals and reduce the generating prime factors to one<br/>octave also.</p><p>Does anybody have any good ideas how to revive cheaply a Mac SE/30 with<br/>a dead hard disk so I can continue to run system 6.0X on it. MicroSoft<br/>QuickBASIC, in which all my lattice and theory programs are written,<br/>won&apos;t run under system 7 or above. Of course, I can learn C(++),<br/>Mathematica, VisualBasic, Pascal, etc., but that means re-writing<br/>thousands of lines of code and revising the program structure for these<br/>modern GUI-oriented programming systems.</p><p>--John</p></div>
