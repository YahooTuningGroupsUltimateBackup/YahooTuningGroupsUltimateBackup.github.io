Two of the white keys are redundant and are tuned the same as<br/>adjacent black keys.</p><p>In the columns below I show the keyboard key, the cents deviation from<br/>12-tET, and four different notations:<br/>Graham Breed&apos;s decimal numbers, decatonic letters, Tartini/Fokker 31 note,<br/>Tartini/Fokker 72 note.</p><p>Kbd Cent Dec Dec T/F T/F<br/>Key dev  num let 31  72<br/>--------------------------<br/>A   +33  0   A   A|  A|\<br/>Bb  +50  1   B   B;  B;<br/>B   -50  1   B   B;  B;<br/>C   -33  2   C   C;  C;/<br/>C#  -17  3   L   C#  C#\<br/>D     0  4   D   D   D<br/>Eb  +17  5   N   Eb  Eb/<br/>E   +33  6   E   E|  E|\<br/>F   +50  7   F   F|  F|<br/>F#  -50  7   F   F|  F|<br/>G   -33  8   G   G;  G;/<br/>G#  -16  9   H   G;  G#\</p><p>The decimal numerals have been realigned relative to Grahams earlier<br/>conversion chart.</p><p>The decatonic letters are slightly different from my earlier proposal. I<br/>switched from K and L to L and N so that the numbers agree with the letters<br/>modulo 10. e.g. ABC could also be IJK and D could also be M.</p><p>The ASCIIfied Tartini/Fokker notation is Manuel&apos;s and uses<br/>| half sharp<br/>; half-flat<br/>/ comma up<br/>\ comma down</p><p>In real life Tartini&apos;s half sharp looks  more like</p><p> |<br/>-|-<br/> |<br/>-|-<br/> |</p><p>and Tartini&apos;s half flat looks more like</p><p> |<br/> |<br/> |<br/> | /<br/> |/</p><p>Fokker&apos;s comma strokes are just as they are in ASCII.</p><p>The pentatonics are generated by Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s generator (~14/72 oct,<br/>every second miracle generator). They are a quasi-equal pentatonic or<br/>slendro scale (Dudon&apos;s slendro_s2.scl). They are also a degenerate<br/>1.7.49.343 Hexany (hexany18.scl).</p><p>The decatonic is similar to a half Euler-Fokker Genus 357777<br/>(halfefg357777.scl) (9.3 c error).</p><p>I would have given a Scala file for this 12-tET to Miracle-10 mapping but I<br/>assume the 2/1 must be C, and if C is 0/1200 cents then some other notes<br/>will need 83 cent deviations and I know some devices&apos; tuning tables only<br/>allow -64 to +63 cents deviation. Can someone help me out here?</p><p>If we need to make it clear that a letter is a decimal letter and not a<br/>diatonic letter, I propose we use a subscript &quot;o&quot;, as in &quot;Ao&quot; (read A<br/>decimal). This is unnecessary for chromatic alterations if we use &quot;^&quot; and<br/>&quot;v&quot; for these as Graham Breed proposes, and Monz stops using them for ASCII<br/>72-EDO 1/4-tones (possibly using | and ; instead).</p><p>So you can think of &quot;o&quot; as the natural of &quot;^&quot; and &quot;v&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m going to give some chords and things using decimal letter notation, so<br/>you might want to put some little stickers on your G#, C# and Eb keys<br/>reading respectively &quot;H&quot;, &quot;L&quot; and &quot;N&quot;. And remember that Bo can be played<br/>on either the B or Bb key, similarly Fo can be played on either the F or F#<br/>key.</p><p>The two Slendro pentatonics are ACDEG and BLNFH.</p><p>Here are some triads in root position to get you started:</p><p>Neutral   : ALE, BDF, CNG, LEH<br/>4:5:7     : FAN, GBE, HCF<br/>4:6:7     : CGA, LHB<br/>6:9:11    : AEH</p><p>If you find other chords, please post them. There are the utonal versions<br/>of the non-neutral ones above. There are also some ASSes in there<br/>somewhere. I&apos;m sure you will find other interesting ones by listening, that<br/>I haven&apos;t found with the numbers. And I&apos;m dying to hear some more music in<br/>this scale. :-)</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2001 12:29:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>As requested by Joseph Pehrson via email.</p><p>!

The only ASCII 72-EDO<br/>notation you had wrong was the first one.  You had C#-<br/>instead of C#+.</p><p>Here&apos;s a formula that you might find helpful:  Notice that<br/>in ASCII 72-EDO, as you cycle thru a MIRACLE scale by<br/>means of the 7/72-&quot;octave&quot; generator, the accidental<br/>for each successive 12-EDO nominal bumps up to the next higher<br/>symbol.  So if you start on C, there is no accidental.  Then,</p><p> C# gets a +<br/> D  gets a &gt;<br/> Eb gets a ^  ...or the simpler enharmonic Ev, which starts<br/>                 a new pattern:<br/> F  gets a &lt;<br/> F# gets a -<br/> G  has no accidental<br/> G# gets a +</p><p>etc.</p><p>You can see this process vividly by looking at my Ztar<br/>blackjack mapping, shown in the first mapping example at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/blackjack/blackjack.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/blackjack/blackjack.htm</a>&gt;.</p><p>The break that Dave made in the cycle in this particular<br/>scale is that after G#+, he used Bb&lt; [= 2^(58/72)] instead<br/>of A&gt; [= 2^(56/72)].  If you look again at my blackjack mapping<br/>you&apos;ll see that up to that point, the 10-note scale uses the<br/>lower of each pair of blackjack notes, then at that point<br/>switches to the higher of the last two pairs.</p><p>This is probably actually shown more clearly on Dave&apos;s own<br/>chart &lt;<a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/MiraclePitchChart.htm">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/MiraclePitchChart.htm</a>&gt;,<br/>but the lack of ASCII 72-EDO notation there makes it hard<br/>for me to see it too.  I know you&apos;re philosophically opposed<br/>to ASCII 72-EDO for MIRACLE, Dave, but how about adding it<br/>anyway, to help those of us who like it?  It would probably<br/>lead to greater understanding of your own notational preferences.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2001 12:47:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello Dave and list!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thank you so much for this!

I admit there could be<br/>improvements to it, but it seems even MORE intuitive than the &quot;cents<br/>notation&quot; method I was using previously.  The smallest unit, after<br/>all, is only 1/12 of a whole tone!!!</p><p>As far as the MIDI setup is concerned, I am rather limited, since I<br/>only have 8 voices to use with my present setup.  (Limitations are<br/>good, though... I really don&apos;t feel I&apos;ve totally exhausted everything<br/>there yet...

They fulfil most of the criteria so long as<br/>you bend the rules on harmony a bit.</p><p>I find I can get acculturated to neutral triads fairly quickly.  If I hear<br/>enough of them in a row, the 31-equal minor third even works as a<br/>dissonance.  Melodically, the MOS at least is fairly bland.  But I find<br/>this ideal for a bleached-out, apathetic kind of feel.  It would suit a<br/>lot of Stina Nordenstam&apos;s music, which is why I had a go at converting<br/>that one piece.  If I get into the right mood again, I&apos;ll try and finish<br/>that, if summoning up the motivation doesn&apos;t itself destroy the apathy ;)</p><p>There are some cool pentatonics within both neutral third heptatonics.<br/>They work well melodically, but I don&apos;t think would fulfil the harmonic<br/>criteria for a generalised diatonic.</p><p>But taking either a neutral-third or fifth-based MOS as a Miracle diatonic<br/>is somewhat bizarre.  The meantone diatonic doesn&apos;t have the 5-limit<br/>intervals spelt right.  And if you&apos;re tuned to 72-equal, it means you&apos;re<br/>only taking 1/6 of the scale.  There are easier ways of getting the same<br/>result!</p><p>I think it makes more sense to use the JI diatonic, and allow for some<br/>&quot;enharmonicism&quot; (see my other post).  But that drags you into 12-note<br/>thinking, so you&apos;re not really exploiting the miracle-ness.</p><p>Similarly for the neutral-third scales.  The &quot;wolf&quot; minor third isn&apos;t<br/>anything special in Miracle.  Taking a neutral third MOS from Blackjack<br/>means one third of the gamut.  And no modulation by notes within the scale<br/>can cover any more of the gamut.  So the ideas I suggested about<br/>modulating between the MOS and Rast scales won&apos;t work at all -- or won&apos;t<br/>make sense in context.</p><p>Also, when you get to the Rast it is important the 5-limit intervals<br/>should be in tune.  To get all the 11-limit intervals of these scales to<br/>work means they become really fluid concepts.  The distinction between<br/>major and neutral seconds is blurred, but perhaps an approach like this<br/>based on the neutral-third MOS would work.</p><p>&gt; But if you loosen the definition of generalized diatonic a bit . . .<br/>&gt; for example, if you allow chords to be formed from different<br/>&gt; permutations of a set of two generic chord-constructing intervals . . .<br/>&gt; and you allow a small number of unsaturated chords . . . you see that<br/>&gt; Blackjack itself doesn&apos;t look so bad as a generalized diatonic!<br/>&gt; Certainly, the 33-cent steps make it very unlike any &quot;white-note scale&quot;<br/>&gt; heretofore considered . . . but who knows how this ball-game will<br/>&gt; evolve!</p><p>Indeed, Blackjack sort of works, but so many notes!  I think it&apos;s good<br/>that Miracle thinking doesn&apos;t guide you into a simple, &quot;white note&quot;<br/>diatonic.  It leaves to composer free to define whatever key centers and<br/>modes they like, and also &quot;encourages&quot; them to think about how some tuning<br/>details should be resolved.  It&apos;s a post modern temperament, gaining value<br/>from the multitude of scales it contains, rather than it&apos;s rendition of<br/>one particular scale.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>5/24/2001 6:10:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:9ehra9+r6j6@eGroups.com">9ehra9+r6j6@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt; But I&apos;m pretty sure that if you could make the break from the 12-tET<br/>&gt; based notation to a decimal one you would find that the decimal<br/>&gt; notation, while still requiring accidentals in almost all consonant<br/>&gt; chords, would automatically tell you where the wolves are.

Only 7 gives you neutral seconds, but it<br/>doesn&apos;t have a tritones.  12 doesn&apos;t have neutral thirds, and hence does<br/>place major and minor thirds in different interval classes.  10 lumps 7:6<br/>in with 8:7 rather than 6:5, which does make some sense but means<br/>diminished triads don&apos;t look symmetric.</p><p>11:10 and 10:9 are relatively complex intervals in Miracle temperament, so<br/>you probably wouldn&apos;t use them as much as in free JI.

It&apos;s not all _that_ bad harmonically, is it?<br/>&gt; It has more triads than notes. So how is its stability? The answers<br/>&gt; you get for these Rothenberg quantities depends entirely on whether<br/>&gt; you consider the 1 step of 150c to be quite distinct from the 9 of<br/>&gt; 117c. Otherwise it might as well be 10-EDO with extremely low<br/>&gt; efficiency.</p><p>On the nominals, only the &quot;minor&quot; 4-step (and complement) is not an<br/>11-limit consonance.

So you could maybe take a 7-note subset and<br/>call it the &quot;mode&quot;, but allow diesis shifts relative to that.  I&apos;ll call<br/>this &quot;enharmonicism&quot; whereas taking notes outside of the 7 interval<br/>classes would be &quot;chromaticism&quot;.  So you&apos;re taking 7 out of 10 interval<br/>classes rather than 7 pitch classes from the 10 nominals.</p><p>This is taking &quot;interval class&quot; to mean intervals we consciously think of<br/>as different, but group together for convenience.  &quot;Pitch classes&quot; are<br/>notes that may or may not have the same pitch or be written the same, but<br/>are considered equivalent in the relevant temperament.</p><p>If you&apos;re really lucky, I might observe this distinction myself ;)</p><p>So another approach to 9-limit harmony would be to define a regular<br/>diatonic mode in terms of 12 interval classes.  You can then use<br/>enharmonic shifts to make a minor third 7:6 or a tone 8:7, and also choose<br/>which kind of tritone you want.</p><p>The problem I have with 12 interval classes for 11-limit enharmonicism is<br/>that there&apos;s no concept of &quot;neutral third&quot;.  So you have to set the<br/>submajor and superminor thirds to be equivalent.  This is a problem for<br/>Miracle temperament where that equivalence is important.  So we go back to<br/>our 7 nominals, which work fine defined on 31, but lose the &quot;7 from<br/>12-ness&quot;.</p><p>The Boston 72-equal notation does still have the 7 nominals behind it, so<br/>neutral thirds are still there.  But it&apos;s still going to be cumbersome for<br/>Miracle progressions.  I don&apos;t have examples to hand, but hopefully when<br/>they come in they&apos;ll demonstrate this.

Actually, using a perfect fifth and<br/>&gt; then the &quot;third&quot; of a triad in the octave BELOW and then running up<br/>&gt; and down in &quot;parallel&quot; on the keyboard produces some amazing<br/>&gt; results...
