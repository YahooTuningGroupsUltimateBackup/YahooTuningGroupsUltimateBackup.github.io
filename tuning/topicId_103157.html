Those of us searching for something that works like meantone, but differently, occasionally consider a triadic basis other than these two triads, but usually we only consider alternatives to the major triad and let the minor &quot;sort itself out&quot; as being maybe the utonal counterpart of the major triad.  One problem with this is that the utonal counterparts of most triads more complex than 4:5:6 are much more discordant, at least if we go by the size of the numbers used to represent the utonal chords as a sequence of overtones.
