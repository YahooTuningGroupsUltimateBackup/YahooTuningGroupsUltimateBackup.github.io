This CD is still<br/>available.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Two characterstic Beethoven figures lend themselves to ET, in my opinion:</p><p>The first would be long, fast chromatic runs, almost like slow glisses. As</p><p>Paul pointed out, these would sound smoother on an ET keyboard. &lt;&lt;</p><p>    The difference between equal and well temperament is very difficult to<br/>discern in a fast chromatic run.  Meantone, yes, but a well tempered<br/>keyboard, not usually.  The real place to hear the difference is in the<br/>texture of the harmony.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I would also bet that any relationship between Beethoven and ET would show</p><p>up much more in his piano works than in his symphonic pieces, simply because</p><p>intonation is completely fixed on the piano, and much more fluid in an</p><p>orchestra. &lt;&lt;</p><p>      The relationship between Beethoven and ET doesn&apos;t exist to those that<br/>have become familiar with Beethoven and the key character of a well<br/>temperament.   The concept of the &quot;Character of the Keys&quot; was extensively<br/>debated and written about before and during LVB&apos;s lifetime.   Schubart is one<br/>of the major figures quoted in Rita Steblen&apos;s book.  The key characters of<br/>the time were in synch with the manner of well tempering on the keyboard, the<br/>extreme keys being the most agreed upon.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I also know that Beethoven was one of the first to exploit the</p><p>capabilities of a new breed of piano that became available in his lifetime.</p><p>These newer pianos were the first to have cast-iron frames, making higher</p><p>string tension and greater dynamic range possible. It would be interesting</p><p>to research whether these newer pianos were primarily tuned ET or not.</p><p>Babcock was the first to successfully make an iron plate, this happened<br/>around 1820, long after Beethoven&apos;s sense of tonality was in place. The<br/>pianos of his formative years were of the older style.  The iron plate pianos<br/>began to be built after he had lost most of his hearing.</p><p>Paul writes:<br/>&gt;&gt;Foote&apos;s CD uses some extreme well-temperaments whose pairings with the<br/>pieces seem almost arbitrary, yet the music doesn&apos;t suffer at all -- it<br/>merely gains a</p><p>little color.&lt;&lt;</p><p>Gee,  I need to parse this out.  First and last, is a point being made here<br/>that &quot;extreme&quot; WT only produce a &quot;little&quot; color?  The Kirnberger has a full<br/>syntonic comma in the three highest keys,(Gb, Db, and Ab).  This was near the<br/>historically accepted limit if one was to escape the &quot;wolf&quot;.<br/>    Now,  as to my pairings (parings for pun), of temperament to pieces:  The<br/>Kirnberger is a near copy of the Neidhart/Prinz tunings published as far back<br/>as 1732, and which seem to have been commonly used for much of the 18th<br/>century.  It&apos;s major characteristic is that the white keys are in a 1/4C<br/>meantone arrangement, providing a Just C-E third.   Beethoven&apos;s sense of<br/>tonality could very plausibly have been formed under the influence of such a<br/>tuning, as well as the assorted meantones still appearing through the late<br/>1700&apos;s.<br/>     I chose this tuning so that there would be a landmark formed which<br/>technicians could discuss,( the middle section of the Pathetique uses a<br/>&quot;curtain&quot; of this dissonance behind the melody,  it is tense, yes, but on<br/>purpose), but what more believable temperament would do?  Prior to selection,<br/> we did listen to the pieces on a variety of tunings, rejecting the ones that<br/>sounded &quot;unmusical&quot; on the Railsback-poisoned modern concert grand.  It is<br/>worth noting that this piano carries 45,000 lbs of string tension, so the<br/>effects of tempering can be exaggerated.<br/>    The Young, published in 1799, was widely regarded as an ideal balance,<br/>since its symmetry is perfect and encompasses a near pure third at the<br/>historical &quot;home&quot; ( C-E at only 5 cents wide, which is beating near<br/>heart-rate speed (1 bps) in the middle of the keyboard) and has only one key<br/>with a full comma in its tonic third (F#-A#).  The publication dates of the<br/>Moonlight and Waldstein are within a few years of this temperament&apos;s formal<br/>arrival.  I don&apos;t think &quot;arbitrary&quot; is quite accurate!  What other tuning<br/>carries a better or more plausible pedigree for a Beethoven piece of 1804?<br/>The Young also provides a good deal of contrast while avoiding any great<br/>steps between adjacent keys, making the middle section of the Waldstein work<br/>as it does.</p><p>Paul again:<br/>&gt;&gt; Actually, retuning Beethoven is made more interesting by the fact that he</p><p>was deaf when he wrote most of his music. &lt;&lt;</p><p>    Ah,  we have a debate, here!  This runs counter to everything I have read<br/>about Beethoven&apos;s deafness.  He became aware of the impending hearing loss<br/>around 1801, but was capable of hearing at least until 1815, and some say<br/>even later than that. Things didn&apos;t get profound until around 1820.  His<br/>&quot;Hammerclavier&quot; may have been written deaf, though.</p><p>I also wrote,</p><p>&gt;From a tuning standpoint, the main feature of ET is a sameness to the keys.</p><p>To which Paul writes:<br/>&gt;&gt;Agreed, but you have to modulate through all the keys before you can hear</p><p>that, which is why I said &quot;in an immediately audible way&quot; above.</p><p>   There isn&apos;t any reason to modulate through all of them to hear the<br/>sameness in ET and no reason to modulate through all of them to be affected<br/>by the different harmonic textures in a WT.<br/>     When Beethoven modulates from the opening C tonality of the Waldstein to<br/>the 2nd theme (in E) in measure 35, you can hear a distinctly  different<br/>harmonic texture offered by the key of E. This move to Emaj occurs<br/>immediately after a series of descending arpeggios of a B major chord.  The<br/>tempering of this B triad, though masked by the notes not being struck<br/>simultaneously,  is greater than that of Emaj. (A similar  approach is used<br/>by Bach to mask the harshness of the C#-F in a Werckmiester while still<br/>retaining the &quot; active&quot; feel of the tonality in the  C#prelude  in WTC 1)<br/>    By going so far around the circle of fifths, than dropping back a notch,<br/>he creates a feeling of resolution for the 2nd theme, giving it a rather<br/>complex context.  This is a neat trick, to create a resolution to E following<br/>32 measures of C!  But there is more going on that that.<br/>    Not only is the 2nd theme in E whith its &quot;brilliance&quot;  much greater than<br/>C, but it is marked with a softer dynamic!   Pianissimo is more sedative than<br/>forte, yet the E triad, (in the Young or most any other temperament of this<br/>period) possesses a tonic third that is 18 cents wide, which makes it more<br/>stimulative than the C&apos;s tonic third, which has been drummed into the hearing<br/>at the opening.<br/>     By combining these opposing emotional manipulations of loudness and<br/>tempering, Beethoven creates a very complex sensation.   This is the sort of<br/>juxtapositon of effects that appear in well-tempered Beethoven, effects that<br/>are totally lost in ET.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=17454 href="#17454">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2001 10:37:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ed Foote wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt; By going so far around the circle of fifths, than dropping back a<br/>notch, he creates a feeling of resolution for the 2nd theme, giving it<br/>a rather complex context.

Some interesting things popped<br/>out!</p><p>For the set of intervals present in the piece, my program calculates<br/>5-limit vertical pain (== pain of mistuned intervals) as follows:</p><p>Fixed tunings:</p><p>   12-tET Total          spring pain:     1902472.969<br/>   Werckmeister III      spring pain:     1755256.711 (92% of 12-tET)<br/>   Kirnberger III Total  spring pain:     1572885.583 (83% of 12-tET)<br/>   Thomas Young Total    spring pain:     1542156.918 (81% of 12-tET)<br/>   COFT Total            spring pain:     1362917.444 (72% of 12-tET)</p><p>Adaptive (5-limit) tuning (showing also horizontal and grounding pain),<br/>using fairly soft vertical springs gives:</p><p>   After relaxing, Total spring pain:      578536.049 (30% of 12-tET)<br/>   Final vertical        spring pain:      297621.677<br/>   Final horizontal      spring pain:       27006.588<br/>   Final grounding       spring pain:      253907.784</p><p>Here&apos;s what I find very interesting: the Calculated Optimized Fixed<br/>Tuning gives a slightly MORE extreme contrast between the keys of C<br/>major and E major (discussed by Ed Foote in his posts) than Young does.</p><p>I got the numbers on Thomas Young&apos;s Well Temperament of 1799 from Kyle<br/>Gann&apos;s excellent web page on historical tunings:<br/><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/histune.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~kgann/histune.html</a></p><p>   C      0.0     0.0<br/>   C#    93.9    -6.1<br/>   D    195.8    -4.2<br/>   Eb   297.8    -2.2<br/>   E    391.7    -8.3<br/>   F    499.9    -0.1<br/>   F#   591.9    -8.1<br/>   G    697.9    -2.1<br/>   G#   795.8    -4.2<br/>   A    893.8    -6.2<br/>   A#   999.8    -0.2<br/>   B   1091.8    -8.2</p><p>Looking at the intervals of this piece, my program finds 5-limit COFT to<br/>be:</p><p>   C      2.84   +2.84<br/>   C#    99.34   -0.66<br/>   D    203.80   +3.80<br/>   Eb   301.72   +1.72<br/>   E    394.44   -5.56<br/>   F    501.79   +1.79<br/>   F#   599.92   -0.08<br/>   G    704.71   +4.71<br/>   G#   800.46   +0.46<br/>   A    895.64   -4.36<br/>   A#  1000.92   +0.92<br/>   B   1094.41   -5.59</p><p>C-E in Young is 391.7 cents; in COFT, it&apos;s 391.6, almost identical!<br/>E-G# in Young is 404.1 cents; in COFT, it&apos;s 406.0.  Almost Pythagorean.</p><p>Certainly these numbers provide reinforcement (if any were needed) to<br/>Ed&apos;s claim that Young works well as a fixed tuning for the piece.</p><p>[Dan Stearns:]<br/>&gt;This very sort of thing in a nutshell is why I support a full pitch<br/>&gt;continuum, all tunings, whatever you can organize for the better of<br/>&gt;the music type of an approach. And this is why I clock in with my<br/>&gt;protests of adaptive retuning as espoused by John deLaubenfels despite<br/>&gt;the fact that I think it&apos;s a brilliant bit of problem solving given a<br/>&gt;particular approach. But to my mind that approach is a tuning first,<br/>&gt;music second one that immediately lops off a huge array of fascinating<br/>&gt;and emotionally rich horizons by way of an overriding (tuning)<br/>&gt;assumption; all thirds = 5/4 = good, for example...</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t mean to single John -- out as his work in tuning is<br/>&gt;exceptional -- but it is also a very good counterexample to a full<br/>&gt;pitch continuum, whatever works on an example to example basis works,<br/>&gt;type of an approach: you simply won&apos;t get &quot;more stimulative&quot; (or &apos;more<br/>&gt;restive&apos;, etc., etc.) moments if they&apos;re thrown right out from the get<br/>&gt;go!</p><p>Well, though my adaptive tunings DO soften the characteristics of<br/>individual keys within a piece, they don&apos;t completely obliterate the<br/>character of different keys, because all notes are grounded to<br/>quasi-COFT values.  So, in the adaptive treatment of the Waldstein<br/>Sonata, C-E will still be closer to 5:4 than E-G# will be.  The<br/>grounding springs can be stiffened to force the final tuning to approach<br/>COFT values with little to no adaptive movement, if it is desired to<br/>accentuate key color differences more.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=17501 href="#17501">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2001 9:06:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17485">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17485</a></p><p>&gt; Joseph Pehrson wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt; I can&apos;t see what Ed Foote&apos;s work has to do with John&apos;s work at<br/>all.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you might&apos;ve missed my point here.

Yes, there were theorists,<br/>Vicentino and others, who advocated methods to achieve adaptive tunings<br/>that would maximize JI, and IF they had had the tools I have available<br/>to me, it&apos;s POSSIBLE they, and/or others, would have used methods<br/>similar to the ones I&apos;m using.  My methods aren&apos;t obscure; they seem to<br/>me to be a natural way to deal with the conflicts that exist in tuning<br/>any complex work, given my own strong penchant for JI.</p><p>I would not presume to divine what Beethoven or anyone else imagined as<br/>they composed.  It would be wonderful if it were possible to go back in<br/>time and introduce the tools we have today to past composers.  Truly,<br/>I have no idea what they would say!  But, as I have stated before, it<br/>seems to me to be a waste of time to debate such things that can never<br/>be resolved.</p><p>There are many on this list who take a great deal of trouble to attempt<br/>to figure out what tunings WERE made use of by given composers.  This<br/>is a worthy task, and certainly brings past music to life in a way that<br/>12-tET cannot (for those many composers in the not too distant past who<br/>didn&apos;t use 12-tET).  That makes the effort doubly worthy.</p><p>By contrast, I can only make a single small claim: that, to my ear, the<br/>tunings I present sound nice.  That&apos;s enough for me.  I do believe<br/>strongly that music as a whole is the better for new interpretations<br/>in general, and that the sanctification and rigidification of music is<br/>also the death of music.  I think it entirely possible that my work will<br/>be washed away by history, left in the dustbin of misguided attempts to<br/>breathe fresh life into old works.  But, if I fail, others will succeed,<br/>and will, I hope, live in mutual respect with those whose focus is an<br/>attempt to unearth the way music was originally presented.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=17526 href="#17526">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;joseph@composersconcordance.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/15/2001 6:52:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17513">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17513</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Joe, my real point had very little to do with either Ed or John<br/>&gt; really.

This runs counter to everything I have read<br/>&gt;about Beethoven&apos;s deafness.
