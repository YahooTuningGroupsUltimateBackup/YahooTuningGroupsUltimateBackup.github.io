You also seem to claim that your is some<br/>sort of natural, or universal, system. I don&apos;t remember what term you used,<br/>but it was clear to me that you don&apos;t think of your system as some sort of<br/>compromise, as I think you would consider 12tET. Yet I couldn&apos;t find any<br/>explanation of why you choose your small and large scale steps the way you<br/>do. I understand that they are related to the number pi, but what does that<br/>have to do with melody and harmony?</p><p>Please tell me whether my description of your system is correct, and direct<br/>me to the appropriate place for the explanations. And if you would explain<br/>how your system explains the experience of locking in, that would be great.</p><p>John Link</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Watch for the CD &quot;Live at Saint Peter&apos;s&quot; by the JOHN LINK VOCAL QUINTET,<br/>featuring original compositions as well as arrangements of instrumental<br/>music by Brahe and Taylor, Chick Corea, Miles Davis, Claude Debussy, Bill<br/>Evans, Ennio and Andrea Morricone, Modeste Mussorgsky, Erik Satie, and Earl<br/>Zindars.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Check out <a href="http://WWW.DUESBERG.COM">WWW.DUESBERG.COM</a> for information that could make the difference<br/>between life and death for you or someone you know.</p><p>****************************************************************************</p></div>
