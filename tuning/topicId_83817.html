Buy only second hand and only things that retain their value. So<br/>no paying for software (and Scala is free anyhow), latest digital synth etc<br/>etc.<br/>I think if you follow the above guidelines you will eventually end up with<br/>your dream studio.</p><p>One thing though that seems very important to me no matter the type of music<br/>you&apos;ll make.<br/>If you want it to sound professional and good on everybodys soundsystem the<br/>main thing you&apos;ll need is good monitoring.<br/>If you use a computer that means atleast one good DAC, like a second hand<br/>Lavry black DA10 which costs around 600 second hand (<a href="http://head-fi.org">head-fi.org</a><br/><a href="http://gearslutz.com">gearslutz.com</a>)</p><p>Good headphones can be helpfull, Sennheiser HD580, HD600, HD650 are very<br/>good, musical and cheap second hand, but are slightly veiled (will work<br/>great from the DA10 headphone amp), AKG K701 are more clear and critical but<br/>they make many great recordings sound unmusical, I owned both and prefer the<br/>HD650). Around $200-250 second hand.<br/>Sennheiser has a new topmodel that probably has the advantages of both and<br/>then some is the HD800 but it&apos;s not yet available second hand and when it is<br/>it&apos;ll cost close to $1000 perhaps.</p><p>Monitors. From nearfealds to full range.<br/>I can really suggest the very cheap AppleDesign powered speakers model<br/>M6082. They are used by many big mixing engineers including Bob<br/>Clearmountain who made them famous. Costs around $10 to $100 second hand and<br/>very worth it, they tell you things about the mix other speakers wont<br/> (except perhaps auratones which are more expensive but do basically thesame<br/>thing with a bit less bass) and mixes you make on them translate very well<br/>to any other speaker (if it sounds good on these it&apos;ll sound good on<br/>anything)<br/>Nearfealds like the Yamaha NS10, don&apos;t know what a good cheap nearfeald is<br/>these days, could do some research on <a href="http://Gearsultz.com">Gearsultz.com</a>)<br/>You&apos;ll probably work most on these, so they may not have to be super<br/>critical and revealing as long as they do have a proper sound balance for<br/>making rough mixes / compositions.<br/>(If you do classical you need something else like ATC monitors but they&apos;re<br/>very expensive and you can&apos;t get real quality with sample libraries anyhow<br/>no matter how good your ears and monitors are.)<br/>Midfeald/fullrange speakers. I like old Tannoys with dual concentric drivers<br/>myself but there are a zillion options here and it also depends on what&apos;s<br/>available second hand in your area as shipping is problematic it seems to<br/>me. <a href="http://Gearslutz.com">Gearslutz.com</a> could help you out again.<br/>Amps, for cheap I like the old Samson servo amps, plenty available second<br/>hand very cheap. For less cheap Bryson for instance, also plenty of those<br/>second hand.</p><p>And I don&apos;t know what kind of room your studio is located but expensive full<br/>range / mid range speakers are a waste of money unless your room sounds good<br/>and you place them properly.<br/>If it doesn&apos;t then just settle for lesser full range / mid range speakers<br/>and amp and spend a little more on good nearfealds (no ns10 then) or<br/>headphones (HD800?).</p><p>If you spend your money carefull you can get your sound monitoring (dac amps<br/>speakers headphones) done for under $2000.<br/>If you go a bit more expensive for under $3000<br/>And you&apos;ll never regret it, and even if you do if you did good second hand<br/>deals you can sell things again for thesame or even make some profit.<br/>You can make amazing music out of cheap crap equipment as long as you have<br/>the skills and your monitoring is good.<br/>No way to do it when you can&apos;t hear what you&apos;re doing and have no idea how<br/>it&apos;ll sound on the thousands of different audio systems other people around<br/>the world have.</p><p>Lol this ended up as much more typing on monitoring than I thought :)</p><p>For computer I&apos;d get a second hand PC running windows XP (should even leave<br/>over some extra money after selling your MAC)<br/>If only because you can get all the software / sequencers / plugins / sample<br/>libraries / virtual instruments for free on the pirate bay for instance.<br/>This alone will give you anything like $10.000 worth, that if you were to<br/>buy it all would then be worthless after a few years.<br/>Ohyeah and make sure the PC is dead quit! Nothing more disturbing than noisy<br/>fans in your studio.<br/>You could put windows xp on your intel mac too i think.</p><p>If you want to do quirky music that may mean you also like effects?<br/>The only thing I&apos;d do on the computer is clean delays and Altiverb reverb<br/>(available as a free torrent).<br/>But Altiverb sounds a bit dead. for truly acoustic music it&apos;s great but for<br/>electronic music I&apos;d go outboard for reverbs, even cheap outboard sound much<br/>better than any plugin reverb.<br/>You could get a lot of cheap effects processors, like yamaha spx900, ensoniq<br/>dp2, boss se50. And for more money a great Eventide H3000.<br/>And to interface these effects to your computer something like a yamaha i88x<br/>which sounds great, 8ch ADC, 8ch DAC, works stable on the PC now, and is so<br/>cheap ($300) for the quality it&apos;s a steal (better than all current new sub<br/>$1000 ADA converters like m-audio emu etc) (and if you want to stay cheap<br/>use it as your main monitoring dac too, though it&apos;s offcourse not as good as<br/>the lavry). Ohyeah and you get 2 really good clean mic preamps thrown in too<br/>:)</p><p>For mirotonal midi keyabord I second Carl on the Axis 64. I saw one go<br/>second hand for about Euro 600 in Holland a few weeks ago.</p><p>For mixing I&apos;d do that in the box with something like reaper or sonar (which<br/>unlike cubase which gives trouble, is available on the priate bay in a<br/>stable version)<br/>For compression and EQ download a big Waves bundle or something, again<br/>pirate bay.</p><p>Now for things that actually make sound :)<br/>Which is what it&apos;s all about haha.<br/>I can&apos;t give you much advice on this, since there are a zillion options and<br/>I don&apos;t know what you want to make.<br/>There are many sample libraries / virtual instruments with microtonal<br/>support.<br/>Omnisphere, East/west Silk, The new Garritan stuff based on the Aria engine,<br/>I think Vienna symphonic library has some support for microtuning aswell but<br/>not sure on this, and many many more.<br/><a href="http://Northernsounds.com">Northernsounds.com</a> has a great forum where you can find a lot of sample<br/>libraries and ask questions about them.<br/>Though perhaps you find it easyer working on a workstation synth. The new<br/>yamaha Motif XS has support formicrotuning, so do some others.<br/>Scala webpage and <a href="http://microtonal-synthesis.com">microtonal-synthesis.com</a> have lists of synths that support<br/>microtuning.<br/>If you like electronic sounds you may also like the Yamaha SY99 which is<br/>going very cheap these days.<br/>It has PCM (awm2, like the new motif xs still has) and FM combined, and<br/>supports microtuning. But you must be willing to really put the time into<br/>getting to know this synth, it&apos;s very deep.<br/>Ah there are a zillion options here.</p><p>I hope the above is in some ways useful to you.<br/>It the advice I can give after a long time trying to find my perfect studio.<br/>I used to be rich after 2 succesfull internet companies and bought all the<br/>most expensive equipment, almost 20.000 euro italian speakers (M. acoustics<br/>- Coherence Stage), hi-end Manley tube amp, lexicon 960L new when it just<br/>came out, studer mixing desk, custom analogue modular synths, many vintage<br/>analogue synths etc etc.<br/>Though never was happy with what I had.<br/>I partied a lot (a LOT) and my companies went downhill, I spent all my<br/>money, sold all my studio equipment (along with everything else) and now am<br/>on welfare. (but ok with that for now and happy in life :)<br/>My complete studio is now: Yamaha SY99, Yamaha V50, Ensoniq dp2 (comming<br/>soon so don&apos;t know it&apos;ll stay), Yamaha i88x, Sennheiser HD650, Appledesign<br/>powered speakers, Samson servo 260, big old Tannoy speakers (forgot the<br/>model name and not going to move them now to find out), and a lot of free<br/>software on an IBM T60 laptop.<br/>I paid less than $2000 for everything together.<br/>I bought it all second hand with good deals and I think I could sell<br/>everything again for more than I paid.<br/>I&apos;m in heaven as far as I&apos;m concerned :) If money weren&apos;t a concern and I<br/>had to choose between my old studio and my current one I&apos;d choose my current<br/>one without thinking.<br/>This one just fits me, it has the sound I love and I know how to make it<br/>make the music the way I want it.<br/>Only my monitoring is a bit on the weak side, just enough as far as I&apos;m<br/>concerned (yes, I miss the 20.000 euro speakers lol)</p><p>Good luck with sorting out your studio, and hope you can enjoy it (with some<br/>selling and buying other gear again) for the rest of your life :)<br/>Marcel</p><p>Btw sorry for openly saying to download software / plugins etc.<br/>I realise there may be some people on this list who take offense on this.<br/>However I personally feel most software is way too expensive to begin with<br/>and lose their value in no time.<br/>I dont consider it stealing since nobody is losing their copy. I personally<br/>wouldn&apos;t buy the software I use so no loss to the creator of the software<br/>either.<br/>For reasonably priced software I use a lot, I pay. (not a lot of reasonably<br/>priced software out there though)<br/>If I ever make good money off my music I&apos;ll buy all the software I use.<br/>I wrote the recomendation above to dowload expensive software for free<br/>because it&apos;s what I see as good advice, won&apos;t write anything else.</p></div><h3><a id=83830 href="#83830">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2009 7:52:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Generally the way to go is with softsynths.

They&apos;re better<br/>&gt; expressed as chains of trichords, tetrachords or pentachords than octave<br/>&gt; scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using the Miracle-based tuning system, my scales tend to be the<br/>&gt; following sizes in 72-edo commas:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * major second: 12 (as whole tone), sometimes 11<br/>&gt; * minor second: 7<br/>&gt; * neutral second: 9, sometimes 10<br/>&gt; * augmented second (also a &quot;blues minor&quot; third): 16<br/>&gt; * diesis/quarter tone: 3, sometimes 4<br/>&gt; * wide tone (also diminished third or &quot;amber major&quot; second)&quot;: 14<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But in kleismic, minor seconds can easily be 8 steps, and so on. And<br/>&gt; with 12-equal instruments, I&apos;d be forced to use generalized semitones of<br/>&gt; 6 commas, unless I can sneak something else in there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well enough for now; I might need to write a full treatise on all this<br/>&gt; theory, but a lot of this has been talked about long before I was born.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~D.<br/>&gt; My music: <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Wier/Demos">http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Wier/Demos</a><br/>&gt; My blog: <a href="http://ludwigvan-tx.livejournal.com">http://ludwigvan-tx.livejournal.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Danny,</p><p>on the contrary.

A violin is not more perfect when it&apos;s a pure band<br/>limited csound saw-wave.<br/>The most objective measure would be what people like.<br/>And probably one of the best ways to find this out is by looking what the<br/>people who make music professionally like most.<br/>And they think the real analogue synths sound better than their virtual<br/>copies.<br/>Look at the prices for a second hand minimoog or tb303 or Arp2600 etc.</p><p>And what to measure for exactly? Signal to noise? This is not what sound is<br/>about.<br/>I&apos;ll happily take a bit of noise with real synths.<br/>It&apos;s the soundquality and character of a real synth that is very complex.<br/>The better sounding softsynths even try to emulate this! But still a saw<br/>from for instance an Oberheim SEM you&apos;re not going to get from a softsynth.<br/>It&apos;ll simply sound different, thinner. Yes it may measure more like a<br/>perfect saw or have almost no noise etc, but this is not what makes<br/>something sound good.</p><p>Where measurements in music like signal to noise and distortion are more<br/>aplicable is in music recording.<br/>If your goal is to capture perfectly the sound of a real instrument these<br/>kinds of measurements apply to the microphone and microphone preamp and<br/>analogue to digital converter etc.<br/>But wait, even here the best sounding things are not the best measureing<br/>things!<br/>The best microphones are anything but best measuring. Very old AKG and<br/>Neumann mics that measure terribly are still considered the best microphones<br/>by the top producers precicely because they have a certain sound that people<br/>prefer over better measuring microphones.<br/>Same for the mic preamp, a Neve preamp is anything but perfectly measuring,<br/>yet it&apos;s greatly prefered over preamps measuring better.<br/>As for the ADC, it&apos;s usually preferred to measure best as possible when<br/>recording a voice like in the example above.<br/>But there&apos;s a whole rap / hiphop / house scene that loves old samplers like<br/>emu sp1200, ensoniq eps, old akai samplers etc.<br/>These machines would be worthless if they&apos;d had converters like those used<br/>today, who measure a lot better but most often sound cheap and tiny. They&apos;re<br/>preferred and demand a high price today precicely because they have a sound<br/>that the computer cannot replicate. (no you can&apos;t get even close by simply<br/>making wav files lower bitrate / samplerate and add fake distortion etc)</p><p>You know, another example, just today I downloaded native instruments fm8 to<br/>see if it perhaps improved over fm7 and if perhaps i remebered wrong in<br/>thinking it sounded like crap back when i tried it.<br/>But no, it still sounds like crap. It sounds tiny and thin and cheap<br/>compared to my SY99 and V50. And this is after recording my synths, so the<br/>sound is out of thesame converters.<br/>How can this be? The SY99 and V50 are digital FM synths. Forget emulating<br/>analogue, this is digital it should be able to replicate perfectly on the<br/>computer right? only with modern code and better resolution improving signal<br/>to noise and reducing distortion etc.<br/>But either native instruments wrote horrible code, or (what i think is the<br/>case) yamaha wrote not prerfect code but musical code.<br/>They built custom chips for their synths that sounded right, selected the<br/>right DAC with their ears etc. Something like that I think.<br/>Anyhow, in the end my SY99 and V50 sound huge and musical. And the FM8<br/>sounds like a toy / plugin.</p><p>Same story for effects. There isn&apos;t a single dsp based reverb plugin for the<br/>computer that sounds really great.<br/>Somehow this is apparently still done better by dedicated hardware. For<br/>instance the new bricasti reverb.<br/>And there are many many great sounding vintage reverbs that have a sound no<br/>plugin comes even remotely close to. Lexicon 224, EMT 250 etc.</p><p>Perhaps one day the computer will be powerfull enough and the programmers<br/>good enough to emulate convincingly the things that makes certain hardware<br/>sound so good, and then make virtual synths and effects etc that are unique<br/>/ have no hardware equal, that sound even better than any hardware has ever<br/>sounded.<br/>But right now this is certainately not the case.<br/>So untill then saying softsynths sound better than harware synths is simply<br/>wrong. It&apos;s the other way around most of the time.</p></div><h3><a id=83838 href="#83838">ðŸ”—</a>cpertsinides &#x3C;cpertsinides@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2009 4:30:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Interesting discussion here on hardware vs software. Normally I&apos;d just stay out of it, but I happen to own several of the instruments that were named.</p><p>Comparing the FM8 to the SY99 isn&apos;t really a direct comparison, they are totally different instruments. The SY99 has both AFM and AWM synthesis, you can stack 4 sounds together per patch, you can use sampled waveforms as AFM operator sources (RC&amp;M), it&apos;s 16 part multitimbral, you have looping panning envelopes, and you have a very sophisticated effects engine.</p><p>The FM8 has not a single feature listed above. It&apos;s a DX7 emulator with some but not all of the features of the DX7II added in. Notably, it&apos;s not duotimbral like the DX7II.</p><p>It&apos;s not legally possible to emulate the SY series instruments in software because the RC&amp;M is still under patent, and the AWM sample sets are not available for licensing.</p><p>Compare to a stock DX7, the FM8 is a very worthy contender and has many features not available, as well as substantially better sound quality. The noise floor on the DX7 is LOUD and it doesn&apos;t have much of a high end. Only thing is the FM8 does not always import DX7 patches perfectly, special effects patches that depend on the DX7&apos;s original aliasing don&apos;t work well in particular.</p><p>On to the ARP2600 that was mentioned, I have two of them, and also own both of the ARP2600 softsynths. I would say that the WayOutWare version is closer than the Arturia one, the oscillators and filters are pretty much identical to my hardware, minus the noise and adding complete MIDI and plugin parameter control of every knob and cable.</p><p>Now that is great, but I will put the hardware ARP on stage because I can tweak it right on the stage and although it sounds scratchy and noisy, it looks great. But I certainly wouldn&apos;t want to have to be recabling a patch in the middle of a performance, which is why I have to have two of them, and I am limited to one patch per performance.</p><p>In the studio though, for recording work, I&apos;ll use the plugins.</p><p>Now that&apos;s for a couple ones that were mentioned, I have a fairly large collection and I will say there is a place for both hardware and software.</p><p>The big advantage I see of hardware is there are no version upgrades to pay for when a new computer operating system comes out, hardware keeps working. It&apos;s also usually just one button press to get it running, which means a couple seconds going from idea to recording. The SY99 is great for this because it has a built in sequencer. I can turn it on and two seconds later I am recording. With the computer, turning it on, getting a sequencer running, plugins loaded, and all that stuff can take 10-15 minutes to get going from a dead start, and by that time I can&apos;t remember what I was thinking. For retaining the muse, software sucks big time.</p><p>Another huge advantage of the SY99 and the ARP2600 is latency. I don&apos;t care what people say, I can hear and feel the difference. The timing on the instruments themselves is tight. Run it all through the computer and the timing starts to get sloppy and there is an interminable delay.</p><p>Software instruments have their advantages of course. I wouldn&apos;t say that cost is really one of them though once you start to factor in updates over time. There are many interesting hardware synths in the $500-$1000 range right now, which is not too different from buying a high end soft synth and keeping up with paid bug fixes for a couple years.</p><p>As far as which sounds better, I don&apos;t think it is so cut and dried. For one thing, many of the modern hardware instruments are just a bunch of virtual instrument software running on a chip inside, so they are not really so different from the computer. To make either of them sound more warm you need to work with the sound with effects and post processing.</p></div><h3><a id=83839 href="#83839">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Lucy &#x3C;lucy@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2009 5:07:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I can appreciate the points for and against each side of this debate, yet the whole question to some extent becomes redundant, when you consider that any of these instruments may be recorded and mapped to a sampler.</p><p>using e.g. Auto Sampler or KeyMap for EXS, and various other samplers for other platforms.</p><p><a href="http://www.redmatica.com">http://www.redmatica.com</a></p><p>This also overcomes the &quot;legally possible&quot; problem, and the recorded audio can be further modified with virtual effects and other plug-ins;</p><p>some of which e.g. Cameleon5000, and Melodyne can be used to generate new virtual instruments from the audio signal.</p><p><a href="http://www.camelaudio.com/cameleon5000.php">http://www.camelaudio.com/cameleon5000.php</a></p><p><a href="http://www.celemony.com">http://www.celemony.com</a></p><p>The resulting samples can then be microtuned to the nearest tenth of a cent as explained here:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html">http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html</a></p><p>On 8 Jun 2009, at 00:30, cpertsinides wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not legally possible to emulate the SY series instruments in &gt; software because the RC&amp;M is still under patent, and the AWM sample &gt; sets are not available for licensing.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Charles Lucy<br/>lucy@...</p><p>- Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning -</p><p>for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>For LucyTuned Lullabies go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div><h3><a id=83840 href="#83840">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Andrew Hunt &#x3C;aaronhunt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2009 5:09:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have not followed this discussion, but perhaps you are forgetting<br/>about analog synthesizers?

Whenever an instrument is invented, some great<br/>musician will use it to great effect, complete with all<br/>its quirks and shortcomings, and the result will be a &quot;sound&quot;<br/>that is remembered.  Had the software instruments come<br/>first, I doubt anyone would be trying to get them to<br/>emulate particular hardware synths.  Despite this, some<br/>circuit-modeling softsynths sound very close indeed to the<br/>hardware synths they proxy.</p><p>We might also mention that there was never a hardware synth<br/>with 9GB piano samples.</p><p>I feel somewhat differently about electroacoustic instruments<br/>like the clavinet, but here the problem is mostly down to<br/>the shortcomings of MIDI keyboard controllers.  I find it<br/>a bit funny that anyone would defend post-1985 digital MIDI<br/>instruments just because their algorithms were run on ASICs<br/>and their output shunted through crappy aluminum RCA jacks.</p><p>With regard to latency, there&apos;s no reason a software synth<br/>can&apos;t respond as fast or faster than a digital hardware<br/>synth.  Or a grand piano for that matter:<br/><a href="http://www.ofai.at/cgi-bin/get-tr?paper=oefai-tr-2003-15.pdf">http://www.ofai.at/cgi-bin/get-tr?paper=oefai-tr-2003-15.pdf</a><br/>Granted, this does depend on your ability to configure your<br/>software environment.</p><p>Of course, for us what matters most is microtonal support.<br/>And there softsynths reign supreme.  Precious few hardware<br/>synths supported full-keyboard retuning -- the selection is<br/>much greater with softsynths.  Sending tunings over sysex<br/>is a big kludge.  And if you need &gt; 128 notes, compare<br/>ganging four rack synths together with MIDI cables to running<br/>four instances of your favorite softsynth in REAPER.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=83844 href="#83844">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2009 6:43:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Aaron H.,</p><p>&gt; I have not followed this discussion, but perhaps you are<br/>&gt; forgetting about analog synthesizers?
