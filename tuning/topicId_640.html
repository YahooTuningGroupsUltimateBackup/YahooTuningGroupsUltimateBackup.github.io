We wondered<br/>about the apparent disappearance of the enhamonic genus. Aside from a few<br/>efforts by modern composers to use the genus (Slonimsky, Partch, Kondo came<br/>to mind), we could think of no examples of contemporarry traditional musics<br/>where the enharmonic genus is used, in particular, where a semitone is<br/>divided melodically into two parts and used as regular scalar tones.<br/>Anyone?</p></div>
