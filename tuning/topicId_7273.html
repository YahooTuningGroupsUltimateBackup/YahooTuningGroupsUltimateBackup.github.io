I guess I&apos;d say that the ideal (for me) &apos;equal tag&apos;<br/>&gt; would be one that is flexible (so as to cover exceptions, like<br/>&gt; the octave assumption for instance), specific (so as to bypass<br/>&gt; the accumulation of rounding errors and whatnot), and easy to<br/>&gt; decipher (so it can be quickly memorized and internalized).</p><p>While I generally go along with the maxim &apos;If it ain&apos;t broke,<br/>don&apos;t fix it&apos;, in the case of definitions of terms I really<br/>think there&apos;s no excuse for unclearness.  Not even the law<br/>of inertia should allow us to continue using a term just<br/>because it&apos;s already accepted, when there are much better<br/>solutions.</p><p>In this case, I think Dan&apos;s argument that ET can mean an<br/>equal division of *any* interval is absolutely a good one,<br/>and the qualification of how many degrees that scale has<br/>still provides no information to an &apos;outsider&apos; as to what<br/>is the basic interval being divided.</p><p>His idea of &apos;(2:3 / 16)e&apos; is basically a good one, one<br/>that I think is far better than 27.35-EDO or 27.35e<br/>(altho that too gives a different perspective on the<br/>tuning).</p><p>But if we&apos;re going to get *that* cryptic, why not just use<br/>for the name the mathematical notation which provides a<br/>completely lucid description of what&apos;s going on?<br/>(3/2)^(16/16).  I hereby nominate this kind of notation<br/>to describe any equal-temperament of any interval.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
