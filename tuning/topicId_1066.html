This demonstrated<br/>that the maker was aware of how the timbre could be manipulated, but<br/>deliberately chose a non-harmonic timbre to bring out the distinctiveness<br/>of the instrument.</p><p>****</p><p>Daniel,</p><p>Please explain the process by which these instrument builders tune the 2nd<br/>partial in an octave relationship.</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>Gainesville FL</p></div><h3><a id=1068 href="#1068">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2001 8:01:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here is s huge list of scientific software, much of it for free:<br/><a href="http://euclid.math.fsu.edu/Science/Software.html">http://euclid.math.fsu.edu/Science/Software.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=1075 href="#1075">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@...</h3><span>8/30/2001 1:56:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;John Starrett&quot; &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In crazy_music@y..., xed@e... wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;    Alas, John, this points up a truly grotesque aspect of today&apos;s<br/>&gt; modern world...namely, the obscenely high price of mathematical<br/>&gt; software.</p><p>&gt; Yikes!
