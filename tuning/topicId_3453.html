The fretless<br/>&gt; electrics include Sustainer circuits, which more than compensates for<br/>&gt; the slightly shorter sustain in comparison to fretted guitars.  A<br/>&gt; glass fingerboard option, I was told, is to be offered next year and<br/>&gt; would also be available as a retrofit to current fretless models.  I<br/>&gt; have a Fernandes Fretless Native Pro myself and the only thing I<br/>&gt; would change is increase the gauge to .011s to improve the high<br/>&gt; strings&apos; natural sustain and responsiveness to the Sustainer.  The<br/>&gt; Sustainer takes longer to activate a .009 high E than the other<br/>&gt; strings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; David B&apos;s fretless G&amp;L is a very nice axe indeed.  With the epoxy<br/>&gt; coating, his high strings except for the high E have pretty good<br/>&gt; natural sustain on the high notes.  .009 E strings are just too thin<br/>&gt; for fretless in my opinion.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I am reading all these posts from other guitarists with much interest. The<br/>12 tET guitar has been my main instrument for over 30 years, so I have much<br/>interest in playing refretted or fretless guitars. I&apos;ve been through the<br/>luthier refretting cheap guitars mode a couple of times now, for both 19 and<br/>31 tET fretted guitars. I did some interesting musical experiments with<br/>these instruments, but ultimately, due to the frustrating fact that the<br/>instruments themselves didn&apos;t excite me much, I didn&apos;t explore microtonality<br/>with them as much as I would&apos;ve liked. They were useful at least for<br/>learning to correctly play these pitches on my slide guitar, so all was not<br/>wasted.</p><p>So here&apos;s the problem, I do not play electric guitar at all, I really am an<br/>acoustic player at heart. It appears that there are decent choices out there<br/>for electric players, If I thought I could be happy using one, I&apos;d just buy<br/>the G&amp;L, I know they&apos;re good guitars as far as electrics go. But anytime<br/>I&apos;ve had an electric, no matter how nice (including things such as a Roland<br/>GK-2 synth modified Strat), it just didn&apos;t happen for me, the acoustics are<br/>what I gravitate towards. It would sit in the case more often than not, and<br/>eventually I&apos;d sell it.</p><p>I am interested in knowing anyones&apos; experience with the acoustic fretless<br/>from <a href="http://fretlessguitar.com">fretlessguitar.com</a> or if any one has had any luck making a good<br/>fretless acoustic by pulling the frets from an existing acoustic guitar. I<br/>really want to end up with a good quality performing instrument, with good<br/>tone, playability, etc. I tend to use alot of open tunings, so resonance of<br/>harmonics on the open strings when I play a just fretted (or stopped) note<br/>properly would be of the utmost importance.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen<br/>please visit me on the web at <a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>Download a song (mp3) at <a href="http://www.mp3.com/sethausten">www.mp3.com/sethausten</a></p></div><h3>phv40@hotmail.com</h3><span>11/24/2000 4:22:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Seth Austen &lt;acoustic@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I am interested in knowing anyones&apos; experience with the acoustic<br/>fretless<br/>&gt; from <a href="http://fretlessguitar.com">fretlessguitar.com</a> or if any one has had any luck making a good<br/>&gt; fretless acoustic by pulling the frets from an existing acoustic<br/>guitar.
