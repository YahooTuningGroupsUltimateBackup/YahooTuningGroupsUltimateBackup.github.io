I&apos;m aware<br/>of the fact that there is seldom one single tuning system for one culture<br/>(like the tuning systems in Indonesia that varies from village to village),<br/>but even a single tuning system from a whole bunch of them would be enough -<br/>all that is important is that is/was used somewhere.</p><p>Does anyone know of any resources online? It would save me a lot of time if<br/>they were in Hz or cents.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Johan</p></div><h3><a id=10569 href="#10569">ðŸ”—</a>Christopher J.

You can use the Scala program<br/>to display the different files in cents (some are already in cents, others<br/>are in ratios) or in Hertz, using the commands:<br/>   show /cents<br/>      or<br/>   show /hertz</p><p>(Sorry for the repetition if someone already wrote this and I missed it.)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div>
