It so happens that the majority of my CD&apos;s were still<br/>there, as Michael Sheppard (who put them out) would pay for a patch and then distribute them.<br/>Going back to the factory on several occasions, he has been unable to locate mine or many of his<br/>other CD&apos;s (much less the masters). The bottom line it appears that those already out of the<br/>factory are the only one available so if any of you had thought about picking any of these up, now<br/>is the time. As most of this work is from 10-5 years old and i am no longer really using these<br/>tunings i will not be pushing to get them remade. At least for now. Anyway if interested they can<br/>be got from  <a href="http://www.forcedexposure.com/welcome.html">http://www.forcedexposure.com/welcome.html</a><br/>those in possession of them should consider them now collectors items :)<br/>nothing Anaphorian about this at all!<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
