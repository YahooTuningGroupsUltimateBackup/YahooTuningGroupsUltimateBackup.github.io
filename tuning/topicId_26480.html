I am currently in my predicament due to a neighbor getting me<br/>hooked on this idea of making bells out of old gas cylinders. ;-&gt;</p><p>So I&apos;ve found a source of decomissioned tanks (the ones welders use)<br/>and have started cutting the bottoms off of them.</p><p>They resonate nicely, but I&apos;d like to make 5 (or so) into a big bell<br/>xylophone and I&apos;m having some trouble figuring out how to get the<br/>right &quot;pitch&quot; from each bell to get the appropriate range.  I&apos;m<br/>trying to figure out what length will give me what general note.  I<br/>can then try and tune from there (add or remove metal ;-&gt;)</p><p>I&apos;m keeping track of this work in progress at<br/><a href="http://www.squidgey.com/bells/">http://www.squidgey.com/bells/</a> if y&apos;all are curious or want to see<br/>(and hear) what I&apos;m rambling on about.</p><p>Right now, I have 2 main questions (or 2 vexing problems impeding<br/>progress):<br/>1) Which tone in a bell is the one that our minds select to be the<br/>bell&apos;s pitch?  For example, on a larger bell, the hammer/strike tone<br/>and the hum/ring tone sound different.  The strike tone is usually<br/>higher.</p><p>2) Does anyone have any good ideas on how to measure these tones?  I<br/>am trying a variety of methods but am not quite sure of the accuracy<br/>of each one.  I can make my multimeter read in Hz so I can<br/>watch the numbers flash by, but there are so many tones and they vary<br/>in amplitude and decay time such that it is tough to get a reliable,<br/>repeatable number this way.</p><p>I also have a tone generator which I can use to try and match the<br/>bell&apos;s sound &quot;by ear&quot;.  This really only works for the ring tone and<br/>of course is quite subjective.</p><p>I then found this little program called wavanal from a church bell<br/>website.  This thing analyses sounds files and spits out a list of<br/>tones.  If your bell fits into the simpson tone subset, the program<br/>will try to ID the tones (hum tone, partial, etc).  Of the 4 or 5<br/>experiments so far, only 1 happened to accidentally fit into that<br/>simpson set.</p><p>This is turning out to be a fun project.</p><p>While I understand some general musical relationships from playing<br/>the guitar and banjo, my knowledge of musical theory is rudamentary.<br/>Reading through some of these posts are pretty far over my head so I<br/>thought I would go ahead and ask the general question.</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br/>Flint Weiss</p></div><h3><a id=26482 href="#26482">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/26/2001 3:04:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., flint@s... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Right now, I have 2 main questions (or 2 vexing problems impeding<br/>&gt; progress):<br/>&gt; 1) Which tone in a bell is the one that our minds select to be the<br/>&gt; bell&apos;s pitch?</p><p>Generally, it&apos;s not one of the physically present ones at all!<br/>Instead, the brain sorts through the various spectral components,<br/>finds the strongest hint of a harmonic series, and hears the &quot;pitch&quot;<br/>as the best-fit fundamental to this series. I posted an excellent<br/>webpage on this some time ago but don&apos;t have the link handy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) Does anyone have any good ideas on how to measure these tones?</p><p>As the &quot;pitch&quot; is not physically present, it&apos;s not easy to measure!<br/>With standard carillon bells, centuries of experience with that<br/>particular inharmonic spectrum have made the process rather well-<br/>defined, but for your project we may well be in some uncharted<br/>territory. I think your best working hypothesis will be that the<br/>tanks won&apos;t have a very clear &quot;pitch&quot; but rather there will be<br/>several competing &quot;pitches&quot; involved in our perception of these<br/>sounds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also have a tone generator which I can use to try and match the<br/>&gt; bell&apos;s sound &quot;by ear&quot;.  This really only works for the ring tone<br/>and<br/>&gt; of course is quite subjective.</p><p>Right . . . that&apos;s what I was trying to say . . . but it may be your<br/>best bet. Just don&apos;t throw away any &quot;extra&quot; pitches you may be<br/>hearing in these tones . . . they may be productive basis on which to<br/>form tunings and scales later on . . .</p></div><h3><a id=26485 href="#26485">ðŸ”—</a>JoJoBuBu@aol.com</h3><span>7/26/2001 3:39:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;2) Does anyone have any good ideas on how to measure &gt;these tones?

Have you looked at any of Jean-Claude Risset&apos;s work with Bell tones?</p><p>The way people usually try to figure out things about timbre is to use computers, as you obviously know. Theres a whole ton of work that has been done in this field, meaning timbre, and so check out the computer music literature.</p><p>A book which I have in front of me at the moment which discusses bell tones is &quot;Computer Music&quot; by Charles Dodge and Thomas A. Jerse.</p><p>Theres lots more than this around on this topic, but its one example.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Andy</p></div>
