From an historical viewpoint, Machaut suggest 3-limit or<br/>Pythagorean just intonation, which nicely brings out the unstable<br/>quality of thirds and sixths and their cadential action, while<br/>Ockeghem might suggest something not far from 5-limit JI, since thirds<br/>and sixths are here more restful and &quot;almost stable.&quot;</p><p>However, especially with non-fixed-pitch instruments (including<br/>voices), there&apos;s considerable room for variation. Thus some major<br/>thirds in Machaut, 81:64 in a Pythagorean tuning, might approach<br/>either a &quot;softened&quot; 5:4 or an accentuated 9:7.</p><p>With Ockeghem, composing in the later 15th century, right around the<br/>time when meantone was becoming standard on keyboards and getting its<br/>first theoretical recognition, 5-limit might seem natural. However,<br/>there may also be a case for Pythagorean, at least for some pieces or<br/>textures: this might fit the tradition of narrow semitones which some<br/>choristers of the era may still have followed, while bringing out the<br/>independence of the individual lines.</p><p>Certainly 5-limit JI (or meantone on keyboard) wouldn&apos;t be obviously<br/>&quot;wrong&quot; for Ockeghem, and it was in 1482 that Ramos (or Ramis)<br/>described a system of 5-limit tuning for the monochord.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
