Â“Il Â‘miglioreÂ’ sistema musicale temperato: Â‘querellesÂ’<br/>fra Est&egrave;ve, Romieu e altri accademici francesi (c.1740-60)Â” in LÂ’Organo<br/>XXVII pp. 31-81. Bologna 1992.<br/>The controversies scrutinised by Barbieri were historically of no<br/>consequence. They obviously happened at a time when, outside<br/>English-speaking countries and old church organs, meantone was already dead<br/>in practical use.</p><p>&gt; You actually pointed out that the major 6th 5:3 (not 5:4) is the most<br/>consonant interval within the octave after the fifth and its inversion.<br/>I wrote &quot;perhaps&quot;: actually I find 5:3 and 5:4 equally consonant.<br/>Mathematically it is difficult to argue one way or the other.<br/>Historically however, as you know, most theoreticians disregarded 5:3 (see<br/>my p.25) for not being superparticular.<br/>Only with Helmholtz beat/consonance setup it became obvious that<br/>superparticular was not such an important factor in consonance but merely a<br/>consequence of ratios among very small integers. I am not surprised<br/>therefore that Helmholtz was the first to notice that 5:3 was as consonant<br/>as 5:4.<br/>But tuners knew this in practice surely much before: I am sure there must be<br/>some pre-Helmholtz source for this.<br/>(Perhaps Montal in one of his many tuning checks? Should check ...)</p><p> &gt; But what happens if you require that the deviations of 5:3 and 3:2 be<br/>equal?<br/>&gt; Just quarter-comma again! The pure 5:4  comes almost for free.<br/>This is obvious from my chart in p.81, but I did not put it in words there.<br/>It is indeed very good argument to keep to standard pure-major-thirds 1/4<br/>S.c. meantone!<br/>Was this ever mentioned in Baroque sources? Not aware of any such<br/>occurrence.<br/>Their preference for the pure major thirds seem to arise from the<br/>traditional two reasons: a) as a way to render JI practical and b) as a very<br/>easy to tune system whereby the pure thirds guaranteed the precision.</p><p>&gt;I also seem to remember there was some question of what the sources were<br/>for the discussion of &apos;meantone circularized&apos; on your p.76 (first ed.).<br/>The matters were indeed muddy in mid-18th century; 1750 is a time of great<br/>tuning confusion in the Western musical world:<br/>1- We have the above querelles, where they believed-wrongly-that a regular<br/>meantone with suitably larger fifths was the best way to get rid of wolves<br/>(modifying meantone was the solution, which as we know is a completely<br/>different tuning system).<br/>2- We have a large amount of mutually-incompatible circular systems (from<br/>very unequal such as the ordinaire such as quite equal as some Neidhardt<br/>proposals).<br/>3- Some performers of non-keyboard instruments would follow the keyboards<br/>circular systems, others would follow meantone variants, others were<br/>returning to Pythagorean!<br/>4- Still others were suggesting Equal Temperament: d&apos;Alembert for one put it<br/>in writing that a good reason for E.T. was simply to put an end to the<br/>different methods, that were causing mayhem in ensemble intonation.</p><p>&gt;Unfortunately as I am moving house soon I don&apos;t have time to look at the<br/>recent revised version.<br/>You will like the new version!</p><p>Kind regards and happy removal!</p><p>Claudio</p><p><a href="http://temper.braybaroque.ie/">http://temper.braybaroque.ie/</a></p></div><h3><a id=82454 href="#82454">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2009 12:59:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
