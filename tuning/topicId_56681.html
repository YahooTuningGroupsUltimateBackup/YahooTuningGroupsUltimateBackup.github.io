In fact I got a friend to tune a second guitar so we<br/>had two guitars with moveable chord shapes tuned to<br/>harmonics up to 17 and then we could play together and play<br/>parallel progressions.  Still not very useful towards actual music,<br/>but it was a lot of fun.</p><p>See in my position I see students who are not tied to anything<br/>musically, are essentially beginners with no direction.  They&apos;ve<br/>almost arbitrarily decided to play guitar because they know<br/>someone else who does or just heard that it might be fun.  I<br/>wish I could present to them the option of playing microtonally<br/>fretted guitars or something, but it just isn&apos;t realistic.  So I try very<br/>hard to explain that compromises and decisions about music<br/>were pre-set for them when they chose guitar and they should<br/>be aware of these and think outside the box.  Still, am I as a<br/>guitar teacher to tell every student to not play guitar but find a<br/>better instrument?  There exists a lot of legitimate music using<br/>the guitar.  I do tell my students that they need to trust their ears.<br/>If they hear a certain pitch as in tune but the guitar is different<br/>&quot;you&apos;re right, the guitar is wrong.&quot;  At this point I feel the best I can<br/>do for these students is to make them aware of the<br/>compromises in 12-tet so they don&apos;t have the bias and confusion<br/>of most students, but in the end I still need to teach them to play<br/>standard guitar progressions and repertoire and they want to<br/>play the guitar songs they&apos;ve heard.</p><p>Anyway, if I focused more on teaching voice and microtonal<br/>composition and fretless guitar or whatever, I would not only<br/>have much harder time finding work, but all those students that<br/>randomly choose guitar would be worse off for ending up<br/>instead with a typical teacher who wouldn&apos;t explain even basic<br/>harmonics.  If there existed cheap, beginner microtonal guitars<br/>or something like that I could tell beginners that they had to start<br/>with that and then later go to 12-tet if they really wanted.  In fact if I<br/>could only get ahold of such guitars I could singlehandedly<br/>develop a small viable community of microtonalists around here.<br/>If only.  On the other hand, students do tend to want to play music<br/>they&apos;ve heard or their friends are playing, so that makes things a<br/>little tougher.</p><p>-Aaron</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot;<br/>&lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; But unfortunately, we are still thinking in terms of a &grave;universal<br/>music theory&grave; that has no bearing whatsoever to the microtonal<br/>musics of the East.

They can be moved by hand and<br/>hence put to whatever tuning or position is wanted.  So forget<br/>calculating fret position and worries of issues with varying string<br/>rigidity etc., it could just be moved until the actual heard or<br/>measured pitch is as desired.  If I had one I&apos;d tell you more what I<br/>thought of it.
