My implication was,<br/>that any harpsichordist, when playing with a meantone<br/>instrument like the baroque flute, recorder, or oboe,<br/>will fiddle with the tuning of his keys. Take a# for<br/>instance. It is very common in pieces in Bmin, and<br/>there is scarce likelihood that the same piece will<br/>require a bb note, so you tune your bb key to meantone<br/>a# and pronto. I do it for sure, and I know lots of<br/>players who do the same.</p><p>Michael</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>___________________________________________________________<br/>Yahoo!
