Who knows??  I may even &quot;shut up&quot; and not post all the time.<br/>This is a powerful incentive for somebody to confirm what I am (I think)<br/>beginning to understand:</p><p>A big &quot;key&quot; to the apartment was given by Paul Erlich in 535:20, with his<br/>string of fifths:</p><p>...Fbb-Cbb-Gbb-Dbb-Abb-Ebb-Bbb-Fb-Cb-Gb-Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-<br/>D<br/>#-A#-E#-B#-F##-C##-G##-D##-A##-E##-B##...</p><p>If I am understanding this correctly, the &quot;comma drift&quot; or &quot;comma pressure&quot;<br/>for PYTHAGOREAN is going toward the *RIGHT*.  Thereby, B# is higher than C,<br/>and any of the enharmonics to the right of the linear chain are also higher<br/>than the ones to the left, ie. G# is higher than Ab.</p><p>In MEANTONE, the comma pressure is *reversed* due to the narrowing of the<br/>fifths by some percentage of the comma, depending on the particular<br/>meantone.<br/>Therefore, the &quot;pumping pressure&quot; goes toward the *LEFT* and as we traverse<br/>12 fifths there is actually a *DROP* in pitch by a diesis.</p><p>For this reason, in meantone, Db, on the left of the scale becomes *HIGHER*<br/>than the corresponding enharmonic C#.  This actually corresponds to more<br/>how we would think today in 12-tET where it would seem that a Db should be<br/>higher in performance than a C#.  This also makes a lot of sense since<br/>meantone is *essentially* the system we use today, with the Pythagorean<br/>comma &quot;ironed&quot; a little differently and spread evenly as  12v 2...</p><p>?? Pi or &quot;P&quot; ??</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=8670 href="#8670">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
