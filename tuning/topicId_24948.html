Thank you for your in depth response.  There<br/>are several points that I would like to address.</p><p>1. First, I&apos;m surprised that my &quot;claim&quot; is taken so powerfully by some.  This<br/>is only a boast in light of years of college-level ear training that failed<br/>me.  Because I learn differently, I went an autodidact road.  My Korg tuner<br/>and I were inseparable.  It showed 5-cent increments on either side of &quot;0.&quot;<br/>My thumb could shift the dial to any cent value smaller than &quot;50,&quot; which was<br/>outlined on either side of &quot;0&quot; as well.  I could easily make out the other<br/>cents:  I had &quot;1&quot; and &quot;5&quot; indicated exactly (quartz memory).  Cent &quot;3&quot; was<br/>dead in the middle and also easy to pick out.  Cents &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; filled in<br/>very perceivable visual space.  For years I played every possible altered<br/>pitch I could find on the bassoon, notating them in tablature in lists that<br/>are available on the net, and have been published in several places.  Each<br/>time I aimed for a specific cent value...and the tuner could actually play<br/>the sound aloud as well.  I learned to hear to the cent.</p><p>A second point: when I said &quot;Parlor trick&quot; a single time, it was in humor.<br/>Admittedly, it appears that humor does not travel well on this list, when<br/>there is deep misunderstanding.  This was unexpected on my part.  However, if<br/>I claim to sing an accurate 7:4 it will be the 969 cent interval that I play<br/>on electric bassoon on the old J.C. &amp; the Microtones record &quot;Hey Sailor&quot;<br/>which opens with me doing a descending octave and a 7:4 alternation (2169<br/>cents).  I am now able to reproduce this interval in an idealized form,<br/>vocally and instrumentally, and so can most all instruments.</p><p>And third, now that accuracy is established to the cent, and through<br/>modulation different intervals can be combined to other intervals (in the<br/>form of an unfixed moveable Do solfege) I am able calculate and utter<br/>different numbers turned to pitch.  Freak out!  I&apos;m as surprised by your<br/>reaction as you are of mine!  I really believe and &quot;claim&quot; that clarinetist<br/>Michiyo Suzuki can do this.  Also cellist Dave Eggar.  But they have perfect<br/>pitch.  However, by admitting that I do this is shaking the foundations of<br/>List Member belief systems.  Wow.  Do you know what the purpose of the parlor<br/>trick is?  Because you know that know one can ever tell?  It&apos;s a follow up to<br/>asking someone to split a 7/4 into 2 equal parts by singing its logarithmic<br/>middle, and demonstrating that the sung pitch was clearly closer to the root<br/>or the 7th.  It is never a true bisection, which is a big surprise to people.<br/> THEN, the parlor trick and there always few buyers.</p><p>Both your 2 outcomes are unacceptable to me.  You are missing important<br/>things because of an obstinacy still in reaction to how my material has been<br/>constituted in your consciousness.  What I have described is acquirable and I<br/>have always enjoyed teaching it.  However, I mainly teach my own ensemble.<br/>Those that have worked with me are comfortable with my &quot;claim.&quot;  But as you<br/>said to defend myself is silly.</p><p>Frankly, if you, yourself, or anyone out there cannot hear accurately to the<br/>cent, please consider working on yourselves, as some have indeed responded.<br/>I believe that you CAN learn this greater accuracy, in large part because I<br/>had to learn if for myself.  Secondly, if you all, and even more so people<br/>not on this list, had learned to focus on intervals much earlier in life, you<br/>would all have greater control and acuity of pitch.</p><p>But I play to human speech microtonality, as I vocalize it with Li Po.  This<br/>is the linear 1200.  Now, it is a bitch to try to sing 1999 and then 1200.<br/>(No one mentioned that.)  That would be tough to check, as well.  But that&apos;s<br/>not music.  It doesn&apos;t matter.  It doesn&apos;t happen.  For what does happen, I<br/>am pleased to state for the record: it will continue to be played accurate to<br/>the cent, all things being equal.  Intent was the missing element in the<br/>equation, and I see it is still a misunderstood concept.  There is no test,<br/>only an inside look into a performer specializing in microtonal music.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=24960 href="#24960">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2001 4:01:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny,</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to further flesh this out. I think it might<br/>be hard for you to see how much this changes the complexion of the<br/>whole topic... how it gives it all some much needed meaningful context<br/>to hang on.</p><p>I still see no reason why the measure and analysis of actual<br/>performance accuracy wouldn&apos;t be a worthwhile undertaking on a couple<br/>different levels, so long as there&apos;s some basic form of mutual<br/>understanding between the participants.</p><p>In fact, in light of your methods and longstanding experience in<br/>passing them on, you and your students would seem to be ideal<br/>candidates for this in a certain sense.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
