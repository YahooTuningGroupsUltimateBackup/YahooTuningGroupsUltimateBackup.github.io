Chapter 21 of &quot;The Csound Book&quot; describes<br/>&gt; how to make a pitch to MIDI convertor.  I haven&apos;t tried it out, but it<br/>&gt; looks like a lot of thought has gone into the pitch tracking utilities.<br/>&gt;   I think the source code is LGPL, so you can use it, but with<br/>&gt; restrictions.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a few weeks since I read it, but I think they do best fits for the<br/>&gt; full harmonic series.</p><p>Oh right I&apos;ll look into it. No I hadn&apos;t realised that it had<br/>this feature.</p><p>I&apos;ve just found the relevant opcode here:</p><p><a href="http://kevindumpscore.com/docs/csound-manual/specptrk.html">http://kevindumpscore.com/docs/csound-manual/specptrk.html</a></p><p>Yes it says that you can specify the number of harmonic partials<br/>to look for based on the instrument you want to track.<br/>It&apos;s an FFT based approach and I&apos;ve tried that in<br/>FTS but my work on that is rather rudimentary<br/>when it comes to tracking changing pitches.<br/>They seem to have done a lot of work on tracking<br/>simultaneously changing partials through time.</p><p>What FTS can do quite well is to find the notes<br/>via FFT if you first mark out the notes on the<br/>recording yourself by hand rather than asking<br/>FTS to locate the notes itself. (It can do the<br/>same with the wave count method too - after it<br/>finds notes, if it finds too many for instance,<br/>you can simply delete the extra notes and then<br/>get it to refind the frequencies of the remaining<br/>ones). It won&apos;t attempt to track pitch glides<br/>however. Yes, FTS already calls CSound in FTS 3.0 to render to audio<br/>and to let users play CSound instruments in real time<br/>using CSoundAV. The easiest thing would be to use the<br/>opcode, and call CSound to analyse the performance.</p><p>Yes as far as I understand the license, it is okay<br/>to use lgpl&apos;d code so long as I make sure that<br/>if I make any code I derive<br/>from it into a library or a separate program that<br/>I make that available for anyone to use and further<br/>modify if they want. While GPL&apos;d code I just<br/>can&apos;t use at all from a commercial app.</p><p>The restriction for lgpl is that I can&apos;t use the code<br/>directly in FTS. You have to make any derivative<br/>code open source too. But you can wrap it all up in<br/>a library and make that available for other programmers<br/>to use, and that is fine. I find LGPL is not really much of an<br/>issue in most cases for the ways I want to use the<br/>projects. Actually commercial programming involves<br/>a lot of shared code too, with various sites<br/>where you can go down and get examples of how<br/>to code various things. Actually when I mentioned sine wave best fit though<br/>I had in mind actually plotting a sine wave through<br/>the data points and doing some kind of best<br/>fit type approach to find the best curve to actually<br/>go through all the points.</p><p>Like the way it is done on this page:</p><p><a href="http://www.mathematic.co.uk/examples/SineCurves.htm">http://www.mathematic.co.uk/examples/SineCurves.htm</a></p><p>perhaps but with several sine waves simultaneously.</p><p>I wonder now if somehow the two approaches can be<br/>combined somehow - i.e. use the zero interpolation<br/>method to refine the estimates of the pitches<br/>of the peaks, and the peak frequencies to refine<br/>the expectations of the shape of the waveform<br/>and the parameters to use for the wave count searches.<br/>But that is just a vague thought. I have no idea really<br/>how to set about it.</p><p>Anyway thanks for letting me know about the CSound pitch tracking opcode and I&apos;ll look into<br/>it and see how it goes.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=58019 href="#58019">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2005 3:29:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Ozan,</p><p>&gt; Solo Explorer 1.0 from <a href="http://www.recognisoft.com">www.recognisoft.com</a> has a modest pitch to midi<br/>&gt; conversion feature for monophonic wave files.</p><p>Thanks.
