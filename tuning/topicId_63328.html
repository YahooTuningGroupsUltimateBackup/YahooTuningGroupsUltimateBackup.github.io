My comment on 31 was not intended to be a big deal, I was sort of thinking out loud, so to speak. I think a lot about tunings and what they mean, and since I haven&apos;t composed yet in 31 (mainly cause I wanted to concentrate on 34, since not as many people have composed in 34 compared to 31), when I picked up the 31 tone guitar I went &quot;oh, something sounds out of tune,&quot; and the whole subject of temperaments and why they came into being in the first place sort of went through my head...maybe putting this less than earthshaking insight on the forum wasn&apos;t a good idea, if I had been talking in person to someone about the flat 5ths, it would have been a one sentence casual remark and been gone in a second.<br/>  In 19, it&apos;s also interesting that the major 3rd is as flat as the 5th, so there&apos;s some sort of symmetry there at work. If one likes chordal, modulating  music, as I do, using some sort of tempered tuning seems inevitible, so you have to live with the out of tune intervals. And, another subject which interests me is why Europeans, out of all the cultures on Earth, got interested in chordal music in the first place...it seems that most cultures were making music with melody and rhythm as the main structures, not chordal modulation. Maybe there&apos;s no good answer, but I&apos;ve often reflected how much work has gone into creating temperaments so we can modulate through distant keys. And, of course, a lot of great music has come from those out of tune 5ths and 3rds. It&apos;s also fascinating how the natural structure of the overtone series does not seem to be made for modulating music...it&apos;s a deep and vast subject, it will surely keep me busy for the rest of this life...best...HHH</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2006 2:31:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;microstick@m...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Hey Paul...you&apos;re quite correct, of course, the 19 tone 5ths are<br/>worse<br/>&gt; (but only by 2cents) than 31, and I do, indeed, notice it.

These intervals<br/>shouldn&apos;t be treated as less important than the major third itself,<br/>as they occur in all major and minor triads . . . But overall, I<br/>think the triads sound just a bit purer in 31, since both the 5th and<br/>(especially) the major 3rd are better in 31.</p><p>&gt; If one likes chordal,<br/>&gt; modulating  music, as I do,</p><p>I see the &quot;modulating&quot; part as less important, and the use of chord<br/>changes within the diatonic (or other 2D) scale as the real fly in<br/>the JI ointment. See below.</p><p>&gt; using some sort of tempered tuning seems<br/>&gt; inevitible, so you have to live with the out of tune intervals.</p><p>On a fretted guitar or any fixed-pitch instrument, this is basically<br/>true. Though sometimes, you can do a bit better with &quot;Middle Path&quot;<br/>tunings such as, say, (a slightly stretched) 1/4-comma meantone, than<br/>you can with ETs, depending on which chord progressions and scales<br/>you wish to use. This was what the paper I sent you was about.</p><p>With flexible-pitch instruments, such as human voices or fretted<br/>guitars, or even fixed-pitch instruments with enough pitches (like<br/>Vicentino&apos;s Archicembalo in his second tuning of 1555), you can<br/>sometimes get around this problem by using adaptive JI. Adaptive JI<br/>means each chord is perfectly just in itself, but the horizontal<br/>(melodic) intervals are tempered, so that chord progressions that are<br/>supposed to return to their starting point do just that, instead of<br/>drifting or requiring full &quot;comma&quot;-sized shifts.</p><p>&gt; And, another<br/>&gt; subject which interests me is why Europeans, out of all the<br/>cultures on<br/>&gt; Earth, got interested in chordal music in the first place...</p><p>I think it might have evolved from polyphony, when it was slowly<br/>realized that the succession of combinations made by the notes in the<br/>various strands can have as much musical meaning as the melodies in<br/>the strands themselves, and especially after the Western _tonal_<br/>system crystallized around 1670.</p><p>&gt; it seems that<br/>&gt; most cultures were making music with melody and rhythm as the main<br/>&gt; structures, not chordal modulation. Maybe there&apos;s no good answer,<br/>but I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; often reflected how much work has gone into creating temperaments<br/>so we can<br/>&gt; modulate through distant keys.</p><p>I see temperament as most relevant even when we stay in one key! Just<br/>changing chords in a single diatonic key can reveal the problems with<br/>JI. No modulation is necessary.</p><p>&gt; And, of course, a lot of great music has come<br/>&gt; from those out of tune 5ths and 3rds. It&apos;s also fascinating how the<br/>natural<br/>&gt; structure of the overtone series does not seem to be made for<br/>modulating<br/>&gt; music</p><p>I think I&apos;d change &quot;modulating music&quot; to &quot;diatonic music&quot; (as well as<br/>music based on other 2D scales). There&apos;s no trouble moving to<br/>different key centers in JI if you have enough notes. The real<br/>problems with strict JI show up plenty well in a single key. You&apos;re<br/>right that _chord changes_ are typically what causes these problems<br/>to arise, though.</p></div>
