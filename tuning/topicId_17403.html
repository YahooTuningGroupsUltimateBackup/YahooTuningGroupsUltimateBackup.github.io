If you were to use these scales harmonically, though, you&apos;d be<br/>much more interested in the ratios formed between each note and each other<br/>note, rather than what ratios the notes form with 1/1. And from that<br/>standpoint, your scales would rather poor compared with most JI scales,<br/>since most of the ratios _between_ notes in your scales are extremely<br/>complex. However, your aesthetic goals are clearly quite different from<br/>those of most JI theorists, so I would suggest that your best bet would be<br/>to let go of JI or prime-based preconceptions entirely, and start exploring<br/>the pitch continuum for what it is. Forget ratios -- you don&apos;t need them --<br/>they&apos;re probably a hindrance rather than a help. I&apos;d suggest starting with<br/>lots of scales with randomly generated cents values, playing with those for<br/>a while, making a note of what you like and what you don&apos;t like, and<br/>imposing more and more constraints on your random scale generation until you<br/>come up with some really unique and musical tonal constellations . . .</p></div>
