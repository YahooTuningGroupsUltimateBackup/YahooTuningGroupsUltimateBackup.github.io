Kees&apos;<br/>idea of sub-blocks seems natural, it&apos;s just that the size of the unison<br/>vectors relative to the 2nds isn&apos;t what causes it.</p><p>I know I could stand to understand better what happens to a block when notes<br/>are transposed by unison vectors -- an issue raised in the gentle<br/>introduction<br/>series but never fully explored.  What do you think of an &quot;excursion&quot; on<br/>that,<br/>Paul?</p><p>If Kees&apos; idea is right, then triple blocks should exist as well.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
