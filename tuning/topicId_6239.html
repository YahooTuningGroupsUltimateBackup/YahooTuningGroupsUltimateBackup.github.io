Or, is there a Verese-type person using<br/>&gt; 31-tet?</p><p>French composer Alain Banquart has most of his  composition method based<br/>upon the 24t-ET, using  non-octavating series  like:</p><p>B+ C#+ D# D#+ F F# F#+ G# A A# A#+ C C+ D D+ E E+ F+ G G+ G#+ A+ B B+ C#</p><p>These are all fixed pitches starting on the B+ central octave and going up<br/>to C# third octave). Instrumentalists playing Banquart&apos;s music (like the<br/>members of the french ensemble 2E2M) have to master this special serie,<br/>which is called &quot;&#xFFFD;chelle de Banquart&quot;. I found a good working solution to<br/>play it on the electric guitar using a scordatura combined with a capo at he<br/>XIVth position. Open strings sound like A+ C# G G#+ D#+ F instead of EADGB.<br/>The capo gives B+ D# A A#+ F+ G (six notes included in the serie). Then an<br/>easy fingering allows to play the complete range. Other composers (mostly<br/>french) like Didier D&#xFFFD;nis adapted it as well. Alain Banquart recently<br/>retired from his function as a composition teacher at the Paris Conservatory<br/>and has had (has still) great influence on younger composers like Phlippe<br/>Leroux or Henri Pauli-Laubry.</p><p>&gt; I have a tape of Vyshnegrodsky&apos;s &quot;Zarathustra&quot; (or is there an &quot;also Sprach&quot;<br/>&gt; in the title) for four pianos, a pair at standard pitch and a pair a<br/>&gt; quarter-tone flat. His style features more clusters and other textures that<br/>&gt; make the tuning seem a more integral feature. To me, that piece simply has<br/>&gt; no 12-tet equivalent.<br/>&quot;Also sprach&quot; is correct. That&apos;s Opus 17.</p><p>The Ensemble 2E2M produced a CD with 8 works by Wyschnegradsky (Opus Nr.<br/>45c, 34, posthume, 39bis, 9 and 12)<br/>Reference: 2E2M 1001 Distribution Disques Concord</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
