It&apos;s interesting to note the difference between the<br/>Times review and Kyle Gann&apos;s...I wish there were more folks like Gann in<br/>the media...keep it up. Didn&apos;t see any reviews of Schneider&apos;s<br/>fest...what happened?<br/>    On the Denver front, I&apos;ve been working on an interesting<br/>project...some folks are putting together a new play for possible<br/>production next year...it is very contemporary in theme, and one of the<br/>main characters is a guitarist who is not satisfied with the 12 tone<br/>system; he replaces his necks (on his guitars), and is moving towards<br/>pure tunings. I get to use my 19 tone guitar, and 2 of my fretless axes<br/>as well...one is tuned to the harmonic series (1/1, 5/4, 3/2, 7/4,<br/>35/32, 21/16), and the other to a spiral of 5ths. The music is an<br/>integral part of the storyline. What&apos;s fascinating to me is that this is<br/>happening at all...I hope to see other tunings become part of the<br/>landscape someday, a natural and accepted phemonenon...projects like<br/>this are a step in that direction. We do a reading Friday, and hopefully<br/>will get the goahead to do it...we&apos;ll see...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=3329 href="#3329">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Hence,<br/>their different slants regardless of the different concerts they were<br/>covering.</p><p>To stay with Paul Griffiths for a moment, he is a serialist which makes the<br/>comment about Rovner finding Mozart harsh and granitic a bit surprising.</p><p>Re the choice of space: it is true that different spots present different<br/>listening conditions, as do the choice of ensemble AND their placement.  Over<br/>the years I&apos;ve developed an intimate relationship with spacial concerns and<br/>program accordingly.  While I enjoy the magnification that the chapel gives<br/>the microtonal relationships, it might seem overly burdensome to someone that<br/>resents them as &quot;irregular, eccentric or plain wrong.&quot;</p><p>Incidentally, there is a typo describing Joseph Pehrson&apos;s &quot;One Small Step for<br/>Man&quot;: it was in eighthtones, not eighth notes.</p><p>Oh, and the commentary on the &quot;none too credible&quot; Renaissance polyphony<br/>performed with decisive microtonal dissonances is supported by: &quot;Microtones<br/>in a Sixteenth Century Portuguese Manuscript&quot; by Hoyle Carpenter<br/>(Glassboro/New Jersey).  Mr. Carpenter published the score that we used which<br/>he located in the library of the University of Coimbra.</p><p>All in all, it was a great review considering Mr. Griffiths liked the<br/>performances despite initial misgivings about the concept of microtonality<br/>itself.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3><a id=3382 href="#3382">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

The two differ widely<br/>in their coverage of microtonal music; while the former contains none (if I<br/>recall correctly), the latter goes into enough depth that even Blackwood<br/>gets a paragraph.</p><p>&gt;Oh, and the commentary on the &quot;none too credible&quot; Renaissance polyphony<br/>&gt;performed with decisive microtonal dissonances is supported by: &quot;Microtones</p><p>&gt;in a Sixteenth Century Portuguese Manuscript&quot; by Hoyle Carpenter<br/>&gt;(Glassboro/New Jersey).  Mr. Carpenter published the score that we used<br/>which<br/>&gt;he located in the library of the University of Coimbra.</p><p>I am curious -- are these &quot;microtonal dissonances&quot; a result of meantone<br/>(possibly extended beyond 12 tones) or do they come from some other tuning<br/>schema? The former would certainly qualify a decent selection of Renaissance<br/>and Baroque music as microtonal; even using just 12 tones of meantone, most<br/>augmented and diminished intervals sound &quot;off&quot; to a modern, 12-tET trained<br/>ear.</p></div><h3><a id=3390 href="#3390">ðŸ”—</a>John Schneider &#x3C;johnoschneider@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/1999 8:45:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: Neil Haverstick &lt;<a href="mailto:stick@uswest.net">stick@uswest.net</a>&gt;<br/>Didn&apos;t see any reviews of Schneider&apos;s<br/>&gt;fest...what happened?</p><p>Hey neil!! fancy meeting you here...</p><p>In spite of a wonderful year for MicroFest here in LA (two completely<br/>different shows, too! for the first time) we got no press. Just as you<br/>predicted: when it&apos;s new, it gets noticed. Too bad, too, cause it was a<br/>great year - with a 15-piece gamelan on night #1, and gamelan influences in<br/>Kraig&apos;s night at the Brand Library in Glendale on night #2 with Bill Alve&apos;s<br/>beautiful Pelog Suite, and Kraig&apos;s own Harrison influenced<br/>Anaphorian/gamelanish delights.<br/>Nest year, I&apos;m hoping to feature re-tuned keyboards, with Lou Harrison&apos;s<br/>Harpsichord Sonatas done in three pairs, and Ben Johnston&apos;s exquisite Suite<br/>for Microtonal Piano (1977) as featured works.<br/>Yes, we&apos;re alive and well and still tuning out here on the Coast.</p><p>John Schneider</p><p>_______________________________________________________________<br/>Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
