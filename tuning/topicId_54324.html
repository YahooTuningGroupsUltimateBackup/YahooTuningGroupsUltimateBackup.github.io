Maybe this<br/>&gt; &gt; will be one of those post that will lead to one of the other lists,<br/>&gt; &gt; instead of our usual other way around :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve used his idea for the Fibonacci tonescapes in FTS.<br/>&gt; They do a single row traverse along a row of tiles<br/>&gt; in the Penrose tiling (then I extend the idea to other<br/>&gt; fibonacci type patterns built up recursively in the same<br/>&gt; way as the L S sequences for Penrose tilings).</p><p>Yes this is the way we have wanted to play with this, mainly with some parallel<br/>intervals<br/>as you example illustrates.  having different voice pairs crisscrossing over the same<br/>area, so to speak. another piece based on a<br/> few pairs (between 3 and 6) starting at one &apos;junction&apos; all having one tone in common<br/>and going out and later returning</p><p> Ass you might already know. Lou Harrison was big into the fibonacci series and was a<br/>member of the Fibonacci society.<br/> he also advocated a method of doing microtonal music which he called &apos;free style&quot; where<br/>not the tones were predetermined, but the intervals.<br/> these tilings kind of combine these too interest of his.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I link to your anaphoria<br/>&gt; file at the end or this page in the help<br/>&gt; -<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/Penrose_tilings.htm">http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/Penrose_tilings.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>last page of</p><p>&gt;  <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal.PDF</a></p><p>But there was also a cover of Xenharmonikon that took it out past the confines of a<br/>small area but have neither put this up or<br/>can i seem to be able to find this off hand</p><p>&gt; - Manuel told me about it which is how I got the idea.<br/>&gt; I see that that link at the end needs updating<br/>&gt; - do you know where it is on the site so that I<br/>&gt; can update the link? I remember I saw his figure<br/>&gt; in one of the pdfs but I can&apos;t remember where I saw it now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you choose just any ratio for the intervals for the<br/>&gt; wide and narrow rhombs then the tune rapidly rises<br/>&gt; or falls in pitch. But with some choices then<br/>&gt; you can continue along the row of tiles<br/>&gt; for a long time with the overall pitch kept steady.<br/>&gt; So for instance with 10/11 and 7/6 as your<br/>&gt; two ratios, the pitch is very steady.</p><p>I think Ervs idea was to use the harmonic series represented by the centered pentad<br/>(plus the inversion of these) that way you actually can end up with full harmonic and<br/>subharmonic hexads in the most unusual places!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A bit about how that works is described here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/fibonacci_rhythm.htm#Fibonacci_tonescapes">http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/fibonacci_rhythm.htm#Fibonacci_tonescapes</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FTS can find suitable &quot;companion&quot; ratios for<br/>&gt; any ratio entered by the user, to keep the<br/>&gt; pitch of the tonescape steady over long<br/>&gt; periods of time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is an example midi clip that plays<br/>&gt; notes along a row of a Penrose tiling<br/>&gt; using the ratios 10/11 and 7/6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/jazzy_fibonacci_tonescape_v2.mid">http://www.robertinventor.com/jazzy_fibonacci_tonescape_v2.mid</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - also played in a Fibonacci rhythm - there<br/>&gt; I&apos;m using the strict rhythm where the L beat<br/>&gt; corresponds to the wide rhombs in the tiling<br/>&gt; to make sure it is thoroughly Penrose tiling<br/>&gt; based.</p><p>This is indeed an interesting addition to Dave Canwright&apos;s Fibonacci rhythm<br/> and my own Horogram Rhythms.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, it is only one dimensional as the<br/>&gt; FTS tonescapes travel along a single row of tiles<br/>&gt; in the tiling (in the case where they use the<br/>&gt; Fibonacci rhythm that corresponds to a Penrose tiling row).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When using a Penrose tiling it would<br/>&gt; be interesting to somehow use it<br/>&gt; in two dimensions as well. I haven&apos;t had<br/>&gt; any ideas about how to do that in a fractal<br/>&gt; tune. But the same ratios such as<br/>&gt; 10/11 and 7/6 could be used<br/>&gt; to keep the pitch level of the 2D<br/>&gt; fibonacci tonescape for the Penrose<br/>&gt; tiling steady over large patches of the<br/>&gt; surface of the tiling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=54331 href="#54331">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2004 4:05:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But there was also a cover of Xenharmonikon that took it out past<br/>the confines of a<br/>&gt; small area but have neither put this up or<br/>&gt; can i seem to be able to find this off hand</p><p>It&apos;s easy to generate Penrose tilings (and their associated<br/>tonescapes) by doing golden slices through a five- or six-dimensional<br/>lattice.
