I&apos;ve met them!</p><p>I&apos;m not tone deaf, and I think the claim I can&apos;t understand music is<br/>idiotic.</p><p>I just responded to this, so I don&apos;t know why you&apos;re acting like I didn&apos;t.<br/>You -DO- have a diatonic-based categorical perception. The fact that yours<br/>isn&apos;t as strong as someone with AP and 22 years of piano training doesn&apos;t<br/>mean you don&apos;t have one. The way you heard the Bach retunings is evidence<br/>of that, as you agreed the other night.</p><p>If we can agree that you&apos;re not by any definition part of these<br/>hypothetical category-less people who would be tone deaf, then that still<br/>begs the question about what Western music sounds like to someone without a<br/>Western categorical perception. Keenan has a story about a native Balinese<br/>listener who went to see Fiddler on the Roof, and came out singing melodies<br/>in the LssLs mode of pelog. Was he tone deaf? Well, maybe not, but he<br/>certainly was interpreting the tones in a radically different manner than<br/>we are.</p><p>Lastly, I do very much expect that someone with a stronger categorical<br/>perception might enjoy certain types of music that someone without it might<br/>not. For example, I particularly enjoy free jazz, or let&apos;s say the kind of<br/>&quot;harmonically broken&quot; jazz that Ari Hoenig&apos;s band plays. I hear all of<br/>these little fragments of chords coming in and out of existence, like a<br/>kaleidoscopic mixture of harmonic quantum fluctuations or something. I hear<br/>notes temporarily implying new tonal centers which rapidly pop in and out<br/>of existence. I think it&apos;s great. But the average Western listener doesn&apos;t<br/>like free jazz at all; it sounds like random chaotic noise to them, they<br/>clearly can&apos;t follow what&apos;s going on at all.</p><p>Many westerners hear Gamelan music and think it sounds weird and chaotic at<br/>first.

He described his<br/>experience of music as being more like &quot;Grog like&quot; than anything else.</p><p>It&apos;s been shown that musical training increases certain facets of ones<br/>categorical perception, such as which categories &quot;belong&quot; most with<br/>regards to some background scale; Krumhansl famously tested this to<br/>show that a tonal heirarchy of perceived &quot;belonging&quot; exists for the<br/>notes in the diatonic scale with respect to one another. So it&apos;s not<br/>that surprising that someone with less hands-on training would have a<br/>weaker categorical perception than someone with more.

But as to the question of whether Gene&apos;s<br/>developed any sort of underlying acculturation to JI, due to his<br/>extensive exposure to it - I&apos;m not sure. I&apos;m not sure how to measure<br/>it. He certainly displays greater sensitivity to intonational purity<br/>than most of us, but whether that&apos;s due to more JI acculturation on<br/>his part, or a lack of ear-destroying high error acculturation on our<br/>part, I have no idea.</p><p>What I do know is that Western listeners confuse things like 3/2 and<br/>2/1 all the time, and you&apos;ll be hard pressed to find a non-musician<br/>who can verbally identify a major sixth vs a minor sixth without ear<br/>training. But there&apos;s clearly some underlying internalized scale<br/>template there anyway, as measured in experiments like Krumhansl and<br/>others.

It<br/>looks like people without a decent amount of 12-EDO based training<br/>don&apos;t exhibit the behavior at all.</p><p>So to rephrase what I was saying to Gene then, I think that there is<br/>some aspect of how the listener perceives intervals as subdividing and<br/>combining into other intervals - a more abstract way of defining<br/>something like a scale - that contributes significantly to the<br/>&quot;function,&quot; &quot;quality,&quot; or net perceptual effect of the interval when<br/>used in a musical context. And also for me, at least, this aspect of<br/>an interval&apos;s perception weighs more heavily on the way I hear things<br/>at the end of the day than its concordance, especially when things<br/>like &quot;tonality&quot; are involved.</p><p>You mentioned rhythm. Here&apos;s an exercise: tap the rhythm to &quot;happy<br/>birthday&quot; on a table, and ask the person across the room which song<br/>you&apos;re tapping, and see if they can recognize it. There is only so<br/>much information you can communicate with rhythm, and I think there&apos;s<br/>a dimension of information which remains intact throughout all the<br/>Bach retuning examples besides the rhythm. Besides, what&apos;s the rhythm<br/>here anyway? A constant barrage of 16th notes for a minute and a half?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure what communicates the essence of a melody.<br/>&gt; Rothenberg proposed it has more to do with the relative sizes<br/>&gt; of intervals than absolute sizes. That seems reasonable<br/>&gt; because most people can tell which of two melodic intervals<br/>&gt; is larger -- in some cases down to a resolution of 5 cents.</p><p>So I think &quot;relative sizes of intervals&quot; is the same sort of thing I&apos;m<br/>getting at above. However, there&apos;s at least one ratio which I think<br/>matters, and that&apos;s 2/1. Thanks to Graham we now have Lilypond<br/>retuning code that&apos;ll stretch octaves, so we&apos;ll see what comes of<br/>that. I expect that while a &quot;major third&quot; doesn&apos;t seem to have<br/>anything to do with 5/4, everything will in fact fall apart when you<br/>stretch the octave, despite the rhythm and everything else still being<br/>identical, just like Cameron said in one of his recent posts.</p><p>&gt; Rothenberg advanced his stability as an expedient, but<br/>&gt; considers the portion of proper subsets of a melody that are<br/>&gt; preserved by a retuning to be an &quot;ideal measure&quot; (see pg. 356<br/>&gt; of part 2 of his Pattern Perception paper). One could imagine<br/>&gt; an n-back weighting for this, applied to real music. I wonder<br/>&gt; how your Bach retunings would look under such an analysis.</p><p>I think that Rothenberg stability sucks, because the scales with the<br/>highest stability are the ones that are closest to equal. Here&apos;s what<br/>doesn&apos;t suck: considering how far apart all of the intervals in a<br/>scale are from one another, weighted by the number of times each pair<br/>of intervals appears.</p><p>Consider the mavila example we were listening to a little while ago,<br/>where we were trying to figure out what mode was used, and it boiled<br/>down to that we couldn&apos;t figure out if they were using a major or<br/>minor second. Well, if they had used a tuning for mavila that widened<br/>the difference between the seconds, we&apos;d hardly be talking about it at<br/>all, wouldn&apos;t we? It&apos;d be obvious to figure out what the scalar<br/>structure was at that point. Of course, if you widen the chroma too<br/>much, then the small step starts to get really small, causing<br/>intervals that differ by s to become ambiguous. And there&apos;s that point<br/>in the middle where s-c disappears too.</p><p>This is usually where I talk about categorical entropy, so I&apos;ll reveal<br/>a little bit more about it now. I&apos;d been focused on the above idea for<br/>about a year, which is that scales will be clearest to understand if<br/>you make all of the intervals as far apart as possible. What I was<br/>going to do was smear each interval out by a Gaussian and see how much<br/>they all run over one another. I was using an information-theoretic<br/>quantity called the &quot;conditional entropy&quot; which can be applied to the<br/>scale, and thought it might be nice to expand this to use the Shannon<br/>mutual information instead, which was a bit more elegant. I ran into<br/>some trouble with this when Andy Milne beat me to the punch and posted<br/>something very similar which he called an &quot;expectation tensor.&quot; So I<br/>let it rest for a bit, until the discussion about &quot;rank range&quot; brought<br/>it back up a few months ago.</p><p>More recently, I was looking for a really simple way to measure this<br/>for an arbitrary scale, something as easy to calculate as Rothenberg<br/>stability, maybe called &quot;weighted rank range,&quot; but wasn&apos;t sure how to<br/>do it. So I made it my goal for about a month to bombard Keenan Pepper<br/>with information on this subject until he was convinced it was a good<br/>idea. We had a pretty epic conversation about it on XA chat (the fact<br/>that XA chat isn&apos;t being documented is a sin), and within like 4 days<br/>of that he signed on and said &quot;hey, I invented categorical entropy!&quot;<br/>and sent me his independent derivation of the same thing I mentioned<br/>above - he even got the mutual information working. And that&apos;s where<br/>things are at now.</p><p>We&apos;re doing things in slightly different ways, though, and now that<br/>I&apos;ve read the study I linked to in the other post, it&apos;s pretty clear<br/>that Keenan&apos;s way is better for modeling the comprehensibility of<br/>individual scales, whereas mine is better for modeling actual<br/>categorical perception in the perceptual warping sense. Keenan&apos;s<br/>doesn&apos;t assume the listener has any categorical perception at all and<br/>simply shows how much information is in a scale. Mine can sort of be<br/>used the same way, but has a more direct application in modeling how<br/>scales will sound to someone who has a pre-existing categorical<br/>perception for a certain scale. I suggested calling his &quot;scalar<br/>entropy,&quot; although that&apos;s kind of a crappy name because the word<br/>&quot;scalar&quot; has another mathematical meaning beyond this.</p><p>That&apos;s all for now, except to maybe add that some preliminary results<br/>I got in searching for MOS&apos;s show that the scale lowest in categorical<br/>conditional entropy is the diatonic scale with a generator of about<br/>699 cents. Yes, it sucks.</p><p>&gt; Finally, I would again remind you that AP is a skill possessed<br/>&gt; by no more than 1 in 10,000 individuals, making it one of the<br/>&gt; rarest traits known.
