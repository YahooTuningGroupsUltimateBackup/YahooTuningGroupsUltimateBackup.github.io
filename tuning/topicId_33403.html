I brought him a few lattices to look at. Afterwards, I sent him the link above. Here are his comments:</p><p>&quot;I had a great time last night.  It was great to finally meet you in person<br/>after so many years of email correspondence.  Our conversation really pushed<br/>my concepts of tuning, consonance, and scale and instrument design into a<br/>new dimension (literally, not in the trite sense).  I wonder what kind of<br/>possibilities for instrument design there are for incorporating the<br/>3-dimensional lattice you showed me last night?</p><p>StereoDekany rocks!  This is quite possibly the most enthusiastic I&apos;ve ever<br/>felt about a piece of computer music.  I can hardly wait to get home and<br/>whip out my 3-D glasses.&quot;</p></div>
