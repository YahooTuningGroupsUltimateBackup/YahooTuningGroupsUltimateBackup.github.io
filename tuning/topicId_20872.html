(can&apos;t tell) but there is a roughly 5 second cycle in play<br/>Continual emergence of new cycles of melodic and or pitch<br/>configurations......<br/>This is gong like (even bowed gong) - resonant metallic space voyage or<br/>exotic bush.......</p><p>Really satisfying ripples (blooms!) of sound, opens up the ears and the<br/>imagination wonderfully.</p><p>It entices the development of sound perception and observation by delightful<br/>means.....</p><p>A river of oozing cycling colours of sound,<br/>Sounds that continue (and persist in continuing) to make appealing dimples<br/>appear in themselves.</p><p>Bloom not boom (?) nature?</p><p>Its not really drones, its extremely developmental, once you settle into it.<br/>LaMonte Young and Phil Niblock lend, but here there are more contours, if<br/>still healthily detached in mood, redefining restraint.....</p><p>What ARE those voices and sounds - they&apos;re well integrated and bubbled<br/>together, but, other than bowed metal, its hard to gauge, (that&apos;s a nice<br/>position to listen from).</p><p>Really good!
