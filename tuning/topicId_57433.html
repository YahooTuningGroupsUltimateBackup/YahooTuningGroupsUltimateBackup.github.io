Unless I&apos;m mistaken, we (collectively)<br/>now know much more about actual Hellenic practice than Helmholtz did.</p><p>For something possibly less contentious, you could get them to make<br/>panpipes, perhaps using modern Peruvian instruments as models; or<br/>even willow-bark flutes - an old standby of &quot;Things to Make and Do&quot;<br/>books written for the youth of the British Empire in its last days!</p><p>The maths of pipes, is to first approximation very similar to that of<br/>strings, as I&apos;m sure you know, so you could use either pipes or strings<br/>to explore tuning by ratios.</p><p>With the monochord, you can also explore the relation of pitch to<br/>tension - given by a weight suspended from the free end.</p><p>You may have seen the recent discussion on the Harmonograph, or<br/>double pendulum.  Using a simple pendulum gives some fun physical<br/>maths.  And your pendulum and weight could come from turning<br/>your horizontal monochord to stand upright!  Simple and inexpensive<br/>apparatus can be improvised to serve these dual purposes.</p><p>So what of the double pendulum?  I&apos;ve wondered idly whether<br/>there is a good way to &quot;lay it flat&quot; to produce a musical instrument<br/>with two tunable lengths ...  let me know if you have any ideas!</p><p>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.7.2 - Release Date: 11/3/05</p></div>
