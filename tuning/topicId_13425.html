All harmonic and melodic<br/>   contextual relations are depending of this shaped diamond. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Paul H. Erlich wrote :</p><p>&lt;&lt; I find this highly arbitrary -- where does the 45 come from? &gt;&gt;</p><p>Hmm ... Paul ...</p><p>I find &quot;highly&quot; irrelevant (it&apos;s the less I can say) the expression<br/>&quot;highly&quot; arbitrary. Has you take time to click on refered link ? Has you<br/>take time to think that what I wrote about Hindu Classical system is not a<br/>long numerical manipulation blended with fudge factors that I would have<br/>adjusted to fit values.</p><p>What I wrote is pure reflect of axiomatic mathematical structure. Find<br/>another  universal axiomatic theory which has, as simple case,<br/>justification for the list of 22 srutis given by Donald Lentz in &quot;Tones and<br/>Intervals of Hindu Classical Music&quot;. After, we could compare. I don&apos;t<br/>believe that French word &quot;arbitraire&quot; can have a so opposite meaning to<br/>English word &quot;arbitrary&quot;.</p><p>You wrote :</p><p>&lt;&lt; Partch diamonds arise from consonance against<br/>   a monophonic tonic -- what kind of consonance do<br/>   these numbers capture? Joe Monzo and I have a more<br/>   &quot;reasonable&quot; explanation, found on Monz&apos;s page. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Where have you seen I was talking of consonance. I&apos;m talking of coherence<br/>in composition of intervals and of &quot;concordance&quot; in strict sense I give to<br/>this term in a mathematical theory where musical structure appears as<br/>simple case.<br/>I think that ancient Hindu theorists have lessons of coherence to give to<br/>actual searchers.</p><p>You have a more &quot;reasonable&quot; explanation of what ? It&apos;s seems easier to<br/>give answers and explanations than to give questions and define problematics.</p><p>You work inside the acoustical paradigm. Even if about all studies are yet<br/>made inside this paradigm, I don&apos;t reproach to you to work inside it.<br/>However, I seek to introduce a new paradigm as complement. And you don&apos;t<br/>facilitate my task. You give me the impression that you perceive what I<br/>wrote as attack against your work. I seek only to define validity domain of<br/>both approachs.</p><p>I affirm that we have to use a structural approach (as in linguistic) to<br/>understand articulation of &quot;sounds as sensations&quot; and &quot;chosen sounds as<br/>signs&quot;. We have to distinguish sensitive aspects used in texture and<br/>invariant aspects (in acoustical channel) used in elementary structure on<br/>what architecture can be build.</p><p>You wrote :</p><p>&lt;&lt; Pierre, what harmonic and melodic contextual relations<br/>   are you speaking of? &gt;&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s a circumlocution I use to give an idea of what can be a gammoid<br/>structure. But as I said to you off-list, I hesitate yet to begin more<br/>serious talk on that. I need a debate level where suspicion of inaneness is<br/>excluded. I&apos;m not musician, I&apos;m not mathematician, I know almost nothing<br/>about theories and history, but I think I can use my neurons with critical<br/>mind and fecondity.<br/>If I have only language barrier, I can work even so, but if minds are<br/>closed to outsiders ideas, I&apos;ll say simply goodbye without bitterness. I<br/>would have only regret, for I had find here search and passion for thruth.</p><p>Now I prepared for you a &quot;deFrench-texted&quot; version of my webpage easier to<br/>consult. Hoping you&apos;ll take time to look at.</p><p><a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/erlich-hcs.htm">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/erlich-hcs.htm</a></p><p>Pierre Lamothe</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2000 6:01:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Pierre Lamothe wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not musician, I&apos;m not mathematician, I know almost nothing<br/>&gt; about theories and history, but I think I can use my neurons with critical<br/>&gt; mind and fecondity.</p><p>Then why ARE you here?
