His point of view is very refreshing to any &quot;jazzer&quot;<br/> who knows very well that the root of a C6 chord is NOT &quot;A.&quot;</p><p> Gerald Eskelin &gt;&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t know why that would be &quot;refreshing&quot;; the point of view is virtually<br/>the same on this point.  Nether Hindemith nor the vernacular (i.e. &quot;jazzer&quot;)<br/>music theory tradition has much to say about voice leading, and one would<br/>think that learning about a viewpoint which doesn&apos;t suffer this deficit would<br/>actually be more refreshing.</p><p>The chord neatly called C6 in vernacular theory could be a number of things<br/>in common practice (&quot;classical&quot;) theories, depending upon the voice leading<br/>context.  The &quot;a&quot; could be a passing dissonance or suspended non-harmonic<br/>tone over a C-rooted chord or the chord could be an A-rooted harmony. And not<br/>to forget: even in terms of Hindemith theory, the chord can be voiced so that<br/>the interval A-E is much stronger than the C-G...</p></div>
