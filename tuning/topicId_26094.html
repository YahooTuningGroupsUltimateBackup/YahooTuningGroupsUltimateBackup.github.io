From England by way of Los Angeles, he&apos;s<br/>doing something very special with his Martin acoustic guitar, playing his<br/>own material in Just Intonation. With the guitar fretted with the frets straight<br/>across the neck, his compositions are full of rippling arpeggios, creating<br/>clouds of sum and difference tones.</p><p>On June 14th, he opened for Jon Catler&apos;s Evolution for electric guitar and<br/>orchestra at NYC&apos;s Makor Center at Central Park West. He performed his<br/>&quot;The Death Adder&quot; in a 46-minute set that was hypnotizing and introduced<br/>him to a full house of attentive New Yorkers.</p><p>Other gigs in the area included a show at Downtown Music Gallery in the<br/>East Village on June 12th. Performing &quot;The Death Adder&quot; in a 35 minute<br/>set where he dipped into free improv territory (he&apos;s played with Derek Bailey,<br/>Donald Miller and members of AMM) by getting into a bit of extended technique<br/>by plucking behind the capo and tapping rhythmically on the body in the middle<br/>of the set. On June 17th, he played an enthusiastically received new composition<br/>at ABC No Rio in the Lower East Side for about 30 minutes with a very short encore.</p><p>To sum up this quickie off-the cuff review, I would like to say that although Mr. Poole is<br/>doing some real interesting work in the field of microtonality, he&apos;s making some<br/>of my favorite music today. Amazing.</p><p>David Beardsley</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2001 6:37:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David,</p><p>Thanks for the well-written review, esp:</p><p>&gt; although Mr. Poole is doing some real interesting work in the field<br/>&gt; of microtonality, he&apos;s making some of my favorite music today.</p><p>Making music is more important than doing microtonal work any day!<br/>Some one who is putting the horse before the cart...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
