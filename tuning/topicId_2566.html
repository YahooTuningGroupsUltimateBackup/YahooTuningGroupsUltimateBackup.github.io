It has a rather Islamic sound and the 9/8 x 88/81 x 12/11<br/>&gt; tetrachord was known to Avicenna.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --John</p><p>I actually had just produced this scale &quot;on paper&quot; as something to<br/>investigate. I came up with a varient which puts the &quot;large neutral<br/>third&quot; (27/22) in the position of the &quot;major third&quot; and the &quot;small<br/>neutral third&quot; (11/9) in the &quot;minor&quot; position.</p><p>    9/8     12/11       88/81     9/8    12/11     9/8     88/81<br/>1/1     9/8       27/22       4/3     3/2     18/11   81/44</p><p>For some reason, the discussion of Harrisons septimal tuning</p><p>   1/1 9/8 7/6 4/3 3/2 14/9 7/4</p><p>and the neutral thirds set off a light. &quot;New algorithm to generate more<br/>scales than I can deal with&quot;.</p><p>1)   Drive the 3-limit stakes into the ground.<br/>2)   Pick a &quot;third under test&quot;.<br/>3)   Boogie.</p><p>So another neutral type scale that comes out of this is<br/>with the neutral third 49/40.</p><p>   9/8   49/45     480/441   9/8   49/45     9/8       480/441<br/>1/1   9/8     49/40       4/3   3/2     49/30   441/240</p><p>A more &quot;rational&quot; version of an 11/9 scale gives up some of the<br/>niceness of Johns, or my counterproposal, but may be musically<br/>useful too. Unfortunately, most of the fifths are flat, and it<br/>doesn&apos;t obey the same &quot;whole step half step&quot; rules as the<br/>others, but it has an interesting &quot;11&quot; oriented lydian mode.</p><p>   10/9    11/10    12/11   9/8   10/9   11/10    12/11<br/>1/1    10/9     11/9     4/3   3/2    5/3     11/6</p><p>Thats what happens when you forget to drive the &quot;3-limit&quot;<br/>stakes into the ground.</p><p>Somebody give me &quot;5&quot;, cuz I finally got my computer music<br/>program up and can actually hear some of these things.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
