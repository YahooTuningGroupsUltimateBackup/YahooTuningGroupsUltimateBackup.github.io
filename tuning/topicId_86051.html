The goal was to keep the composition to 60 seconds or less since this is a submission to the Chicago 60&Atilde;60 event (not selected at this time).</p><p>The main motive is a 17 ET analog to a suspended 4th to major 3rd in common practice 12 edo tuning.</p><p><a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/17-ET/60x60-4001-1-ver2.mp3">http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/17-ET/60x60-4001-1-ver2.mp3</a></p><p><a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/17-ET/60x60-4001-1-ver2.ogg">http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/17-ET/60x60-4001-1-ver2.ogg</a></p></div>
