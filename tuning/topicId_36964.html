Pehrson</p><p>Joseph,</p><p>I have been hard at work on the sagittal notation project with Dave<br/>Keenan on tuning-math, and I didn&apos;t read your posting until today.  I<br/>thought I should respond immediately.</p><p>I empathize with you -- the lack of a proper keyboard is just plain<br/>frustrating!!!  But I have already been doing something about it.</p><p>The article that I wrote in Xenharmonikon 3 in 1975 that (almost<br/>correctly) defined what has since come to be known as the Miracle<br/>tuning also gave a keyboard layout that can be used for this, as well<br/>as for 31-ET, 41-ET, 72-ET, and Partch&apos;s 11-limit JI.</p><p>Last year I took that design and fleshed it out -- key shape and<br/>dimensions and a color-coding scheme.</p><p>You can see it at:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/KbDec72.bmp">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/KbDec72.bmp</a></p><p>and if you wish to download the file, there is a zipped version:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/KbDec72.zip">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/KbDec72.zip</a></p><p>I also made what I am sure will turn out to be a controversial<br/>modification -- flipping it over so that the rows are right-rising<br/>rather than left-rising.  I have a good justification for this -- a<br/>result of the experience that I since gained using the Bosanquet<br/>generalized keyboard Scalatron.  (Details will be provided if anyone<br/>wishes to take issue with this.)</p><p>Last year Erv Wilson sent me a diagram of a keyboard sketch he made<br/>using this tuning geometry, and it was also right-rising.  I<br/>responded by sending him a color printout of an earlier version of<br/>the above file, along with a letter (4 October 2001).  A portion of<br/>my reply follows:</p><p>&lt;&lt;  The first thing I noticed is that your arrangement of keys also<br/>reverses my original order for the rows, which puts us in complete<br/>agreement on that one crucial issue, much to my relief.  The only<br/>points on which we seem to differ are the shape and dimensions of the<br/>keys, which will determine for the most part the specific angles and<br/>distances for the columns and rows.  I tried a hexagon, but found<br/>that a rectangle offered a couple of distinct advantages:</p><p>-- Hexagons are most natural for keys staggered in adjacent rows,<br/>whereas the arrangement of pitches suggests that nearly vertical<br/>columns of keys would be the most appropriate.</p><p>-- Having ten lateral keys per octave requires that the keys be as<br/>close together as possible in order to keep intervals within easy<br/>reach.  Rectangles pack together most closely, given the preference<br/>for vertical columns of keys.</p><p>I have enclosed several sheets illustrating my proposed keyboard.  (I<br/>was in the process of putting some ratios on one octave of keys, so<br/>the  key labeling is only partially complete.)  The keys resemble<br/>computer keys, but they are actually narrower and taller Â– narrower<br/>for a better octave reach, and taller to make it easier to avoid the<br/>thumb accidentally pressing two keys at once in adjacent rows.  (I<br/>did not judge that a short lateral distance would be a significant<br/>problem, since the side of the thumb would generally be parallel to<br/>the long dimension or, when stretching, the diagonal dimension of a<br/>key.)</p><p>The &quot;decimal keyboard&quot; concept is linked to the generating interval<br/>scale at the left, C being the origin.  Notice that the keys<br/>immediately above the C are identified as +10G, +20G, etc.  In a<br/>computer interface, this property could be used for easy integer<br/>identification of each pitch (within an octave), with the tens digit<br/>being the number of keys along the y-axis (including the sign of the<br/>integer) and the units digit being the number of keys along the x-<br/>axis, C (or 1/1) being the origin; units would thus range from 0 to<br/>9.  Such integers could be stored digitally in a single byte of<br/>information in the range +/-127, with Â–128 serving to indicate a rest.</p><p>The color coding is based on the six circles of fifths in 72-ET.  I<br/>initially tried six colors (one for each circle of 12 keys), with<br/>light (for 7 keys) and dark versions (for 5 keys) of each color<br/>(e.g., white &amp; black, pink &amp; red, etc.), but the result, as viewed on<br/>the computer screen, was almost impossible to comprehend.</p><p>By trying various modifications of this initial idea (using fewer<br/>colors), I finally based it on the two sets of 36-ET in 72-ET,<br/>retaining the 7 vs. 5 contrast within each circle of fifths.  In 72-<br/>ET neighboring keys in the same column differ by two degrees of 72-ET<br/>(2deg72), so that 3 contiguous keys in a single column belong to the<br/>same set of 36.  If these are all colored using the same 7 plus 5<br/>pattern in all three circles, the sets of 5 (dark) in each circle can<br/>be readily identified on the layout in sub-groups of 2 and 3, just as<br/>on the Bosanquet keyboard.  These are the black and red keys on my<br/>keyboard.</p><p>For the light colors corresponding to black and red, I chose<br/>complementary colors: white and a light cyan.  Inasmuch as this did<br/>not result in easily distinguishable sub-groups of 3 and 4, I hit<br/>upon the idea of making the outer keys in each column set of 3 a<br/>grayish version of the central key, i.e., gray and grayish-cyan.<br/>This then makes the 7 white and 7 light-cyan keys easy to identify in<br/>sub-groups of 3 and 4.  Since the white keys are the naturals C<br/>through B and the light-cyan keys are the seven tones 1deg72 lower,<br/>the tones in a Ptolemaic sequence (i.e., so-called &quot;just&quot; major<br/>scale) on C are played entirely on white and light-cyan keys.</p><p>In 41-ET, these corresponding tones in the white and light-cyan<br/>groups are a single degree (or comma) apart, whereas in 31-ET they<br/>are duplicate keys for the same tones.  (These properties also apply<br/>to the black and red groups and the gray and grayish-cyan groups as<br/>well.)</p><p>I have thus given my comments in the form of a counter-proposal and<br/>would welcome your comments.  &gt;&gt;</p><p>Erv&apos;s reply (13 Oct 2001) was brief, but enthusiastic:</p><p>&lt;&lt; Dear George,</p><p>Thanks for the very excellent material of Oct 4, 01.  Do it!  When<br/>can I get delivery of a working keyboard?  ...  I apologize for being<br/>brief but there are crops in the field.  I will take your packet w.<br/>me to the ranch and send you a response when I get back.</p><p>Adios!</p><p>Erv W.  &gt;&gt;</p><p>The files that I just put out (on tuning-math) have the note names<br/>labeled in sagittal notation (old 72-ET version with all straight<br/>flags).  I also included ratios on the keys for 19-limit JI (which<br/>can be done to a certain extent, should anyone wish to go that high).</p><p>I understand that Johnny Reinhard recently got some funding to<br/>develop a new keyboard.

I&apos;m concerned about a useless plethora of &quot;de facto non-<br/>&gt; standards&quot; that this approach could potentially circumvent.</p><p>We have tried to make the notation flexible enough to prevent that<br/>from happening.</p><p>For example, there are at least a couple of variations on how to<br/>notate just intervals, and the most suitable choice will depend on<br/>how complicated the selection of tones may be (which would favor<br/>mapping them onto a large ET such as 217) vs. how important it may be<br/>to distinguish intervals that differ by a very small amount (which<br/>would favor the use of rational symbols).  There would probably not<br/>be any significant differences in the symbols unless one exceeded a<br/>harmonic limit of 13.</p><p>Also, we are currently in the process of working out standard sets of<br/>symbols for all of the ET&apos;s so that no one else will have to puzzle<br/>over how to notate any of them.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=37302 href="#37302">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2002 2:04:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;1) Dave Keenan and I have not been able to agree on this one major<br/>&gt;point (i.e., single vs. double symbols), nor have we been able to<br/>&gt;arrive at any sort of compromise;</p><p>I vote for single.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=37335 href="#37335">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2002 9:08:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Carl Lumma &lt;carl@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;1) Dave Keenan and I have not been able to agree on this one major<br/>&gt; &gt;point (i.e., single vs. double symbols), nor have we been able to<br/>&gt; &gt;arrive at any sort of compromise;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I vote for single.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>Sorry, you can&apos;t vote by e-mail.
