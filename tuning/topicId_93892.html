It is excellent and has a groovy &quot;selfless&quot; mode that gives one 98 individual notes  more than a standard piano. I couldn&apos;t resist trying my hand at an improvisation.</p><p>The music is in 17 notes per octave. Since the AXiS 49 does not have a sustain pedal port I used my M-Audio 88es to provide a sustain pedal by putting both software synths into OMNI mode to accept MIDI input from any source. The two synths I chose were pianoteq and Z3TA+. The midi performance was recorded live in Sonar 8.5  there is not editing since that would defeat the point of the demonstration.</p><p>download<br/><a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/17-ET/if20101028selfless.mp3">http://micro.soonlabel.com/17-ET/if20101028selfless.mp3</a></p><p>online listen<br/><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=298">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=298</a></p></div>
