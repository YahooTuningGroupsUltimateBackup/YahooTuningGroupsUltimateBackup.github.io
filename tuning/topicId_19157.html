You can then place them on the vertices of an octahedron,<br/>and if you wish, octave reduce them. The octahedron used this way is known as<br/>a hexany because it has six vertices.</p><p>They will obviously be part of the 3 5 7 lattice.</p><p>Octave reduced:<br/>3/2 5/4 7/4 15/8 21/16 35/32</p><p>In fact, it&apos;s made up of opposite pairs of triangles, such as 3 5 3*5 and 7 3*7 5*7<br/>(3/2 5/4 15/8 and 7/4 21/16 35/32)<br/>7 3*7 5*7 is a major chord 1 3 5<br/>and 3 5 3*5 is a minor chord 1/5 1/3 1/1<br/>The two triangles join together to make the octahedron.</p><p>1 3 5 is otonal (expressed most simply using overtone series)<br/>and 1/5 1/3 1/1 is utonal (expressed most simply using undertone series).</p><p>Here it is in VRML, which you can get a plug in to view in p.c, and<br/>there are some for the mac too, but they don&apos;t seem to work nearly as well<br/>as they do for the p.c.</p><p>--------------------viewers-------------------------</p><p>I&apos;d recommend Cosmo Player<br/><a href="http://www.cai.com/cosmo/home.htm">http://www.cai.com/cosmo/home.htm</a></p><p>You could also try ticking Control Panel | Add Remove Programs | Windows Setup | Internet<br/>tools | Microsoft VRML 2.0<br/>viewer (which I think might be WorldView, another good one).</p><p>Another good one is Cortona:<br/><a href="http://www.parallelgraphics.com/products/cortona/download/">http://www.parallelgraphics.com/products/cortona/download/</a></p><p>However, VRML causes lots of problems for the mac (especially, beware of the Cosmo Player<br/>beta for the mac, which can erase your address book when you install it!!!<br/>- while Cosmo Player is one of the best VRML viewers for the p.c.).</p><p>In fact, I haven&apos;t yet heard from anyone who has been able to view these<br/>successfully on the mac, and if anyone has, would like to hear from them,<br/>so I can recommend the viewer they use as one that works on at least some<br/>macs!</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><a href="http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/interactive_models_with_titles/hexany.wrl">http://www.rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk/interactive_models_with_titles/hexany.wrl</a><br/>Click on the ratios to hear the notes, and on the cyan or red spheres to hear the diads<br/>or triads.</p><p>Octahedron has eight faces, so four &quot;opposite pairs&quot; of faces.</p><p>So lets look at the other three.</p><p>1*5 3*5 7*5 and 1*3 1*7 3*7<br/>(5/4 15/8 35/32 and 3/2 7/4 21/16)<br/>That is clearly<br/>1 3 7 and 1/7 1/3 1/1</p><p>The others are going to be<br/>1 5 7 and 1/7 1/5 1/1<br/>and<br/>3 5 7, 1/3 1/5 1/7.</p><p>So the 1 3 5 7 hexany notes can be used to make all the otonal triads that<br/>are subsets of 1 3 5 7, and all the utonal triads that are subsets of 1/1 1/3 1/5 1/7<br/>and the otonal triads are opposite the utonal ones.</p><p>That is a lot of consonant triads for a six note scale!</p><p>Now try five factors, say<br/>1 3 5 7 11</p><p>You can make two different scales this time. One uses all pairs of factors,<br/>and the other uses all triples, and both have 10 notes.</p><p>For instance, the one using pairs of factors has<br/>1*3, 1*5, 1*7, 1*11, 3*5, 3*7, 3*11, 5*7, 5*11 and 7*11<br/>as the ten vertices.</p><p>They are known as dekanies, because they have ten vertices, and so,<br/>ten notes.</p><p>One of them is richer in otonal chords, and the other is richer in<br/>utonal chords.</p><p>Now, with the extra factor, one can have otonal or utonal _tetrads_ (four note chords).</p><p>The one that you make using three factors at a time is the one rich<br/>in utonal chords, and with utonal tetrads, and the other is especially<br/>good for otonal chords, with otonal tetrads.</p><p>This time, three space dimensions aren&apos;t enough to show the<br/>shape, as each time you add an extra factor, you need one extra<br/>dimension.</p><p>1 3 = linear lattice - cycle of fifths, needs only one dimension<br/>1 3 5 = the 3 5 lattice - needs two dimensions.<br/>1 3 5 7 = needs three dimensions.</p><p>Add another, and you need a fourth space dimension at right angles to<br/>the three we are familiar with.</p><p>It is _not_ the dimension of time though, just another space dimension, if<br/>one can imagine such a thing, or more likely, fail to imagine it!</p><p>There are records of people who have said they can get an inkling of the idea<br/>of a fourth space dimension, and even solve problems in 4D by imagining<br/>the shapes in periods of concentration. But most are happy to view projections<br/>of it, and just rely on the maths to get it right.</p><p>What one can do is to make a projection into a smaller number of dimensions.</p><p>We do this whenever we draw a 3D figure on a sheet of paper.<br/>In the same way, one can draw a 4D figure in 2D, or indeed, in 3D.</p><p>So this is what one does for the dekany.</p><p>Here is one projection of each into 3D, using a particularly symmetrical<br/>projection that I adapted from one that Paul did.</p><p>Taking the factors two at a time = known as the 2)5 dekany:<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/dekany/dekany2_1_3_5_7_11.wrl">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/dekany/dekany2_1_3_5_7_11.wrl</a><br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/dekany/dekany2_1_3_5_7_9.wrl">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/dekany/dekany2_1_3_5_7_9.wrl</a></p><p>It will take a while to load as all the midi clips need to be transferred,<br/>and it is best to wait for them all to load before you start clicking on them.</p><p>-----------------------------------------</p><p>Here is a zip with all the dekany files in it for off-line browsing<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/dekany/dekany.zip">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/dekany/dekany.zip</a> [200KB]<br/>278 files Unpacks to 971 Kb.</p><p>Because of number of files in it, needs an extra Mb for disk partitions with 4 K clusters,<br/>or up<br/>to an extra 8-9 Mb for 32K clusters  (= Fat 16, 1-2 Gb, or Fat 32, 32 Gb or more for<br/>Wndows).<br/>-----------------------------------------</p><p>This has otonal tetrads - click on any of the tetrahedra to hear them.</p><p>The tetrahedra are squashed because this is a 3D view on a 4D object.</p><p>It is a perspective view, and one is looking through the octahedron, which<br/>is the nearest face, towards the inside tetrahedron, which is the furthest<br/>away face in the fourth space dimension.</p><p>They are nested neatly within each other because one is looking at it<br/>from directly opposite the outer octahedron in the fourth space dimension.<br/>It is like the method of drawing a cube as two concentric squares.<br/>Makes the 3D shape simpler to look at.</p><p>The faces you can see through are the utonal triads, and you will find<br/>red or magenta spheres in the middle of each which you can click to hear the triads.</p><p>Taking the factors three at a time = known as the 3)5 dekany:<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/dekany/dekany3_tetrahedra_triads_1_3_5_7_11.wrl">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/dekany/dekany3_tetrahedra_triads_1_3_5_7_11.wrl</a><br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/dekany/dekany3_tetrahedra_triads_1_3_5_7_9.wrl">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/dekany/dekany3_tetrahedra_triads_1_3_5_7_9.wrl</a><br/>Click on the transparent tetrahedron outside the vacant faces to hear<br/>the utonal tetrads.</p><p>This time, click on the faces to hear the otonal tetrads.</p><p>When I do a web page, I&apos;ll do these as gifs as well, (maybe do from<br/>several angles for the dekany) for those who can&apos;t view the vrml.</p><p>Here is the Wilson diagram of a CPS set<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal16.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal16.html</a><br/>and Paul&apos;s explanation<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11031">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11031</a></p><p>If you have Excell, you can listen to the dekany, with notes fading and getting louder<br/>again depending on distance, and watch as the 3D projections change, using Dave<br/>Keenan&apos;s dekany spreadsheet.</p><p>N.B. if Monz or anyone else wants to use / adapt my VRML models for their web sites,<br/>they are very welcome - can&apos;t remember if I said this before, or just took<br/>it as understood.</p><p>It is very easy to change the notes for the vertices (both the text and the notes you hear<br/>for them)<br/>if one wants to use the same model, but for another combination of the factors.</p><p>I haven&apos;t tried doing a VRML of the complete Eikosany<br/>which is a five dimensional shape made up of all the products of three factors from<br/>a list of six, such as<br/>1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13<br/>say.</p><p>It will have 6*5*4/6 = 20 notes.</p><p>However, one could do 3D projections for parts of it:</p><p>I&apos;ve done that for the pentadekany, which consists of pairs of factors from<br/>1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 (say)<br/>(5*4/2 = 15 notes)</p><p>but not for the Eikosany, which will be a much more complex shape in 3D,<br/>if one wants to be able to show all the tetrads, and pentads.</p><p>For the pentadekany, see:<br/><a href="http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/pentadekany_c2-g4_br/Pentadekany.htm">http://www.robertwalker.f9.co.uk/pentadekany_c2-g4_br/Pentadekany.htm</a></p><p>There&apos;s another pentadekany which you get by taking the factors four at a<br/>time.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=19206 href="#19206">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

This is something one<br/>would need to do in a web page about it.</p><p>So here is a first attempt at that too.</p><p>The hexany is part of the tetrahedron + octahedron lattice, also known<br/>as the face centred cubic, or the fruit stacking lattice.</p><p>Each face of the octahedron is one face of a 2D triangular sub-lattice.</p><p>So the 1, 3, 5 and 1/1, 1/3, 1/5 faces are in parallel &lt;3,5&gt; lattices.<br/>(intervals 3, 5 and 5/3)</p><p>The 1 3 7 and 1/1 1/3 1/7 triangles are in parallel &lt;3,7&gt; lattices<br/>(intervals 3, 7 and 7/3)</p><p>1, 5, 7 and 1/1 1/5 1/7 are in parallel &lt;5,7&gt; lattices.<br/>(intervals 5, 7 and 7/5)</p><p>Then 3 5 7 and 1/3 1/5 1/7 are in parallel lattices generated by<br/>the intervals 5/3 and 7/3.<br/>(intervals 5/3, 7/3 and 7/5)</p><p>I&apos;m not sure how one describes a lattice generated by 5/3 and 7/3,<br/>except to use those words. Is there another way of looking at it that is<br/>better?</p><p>The six edge directions are 3, 5, 7, 5/3, 7/3 and 7/5</p><p>If you look at a stack of fruit, you will see that each group of three<br/>oranges (say) is positioned above another group of three in the previous<br/>layer in a hexagonal star arrangement, and that is the hexany.</p><p>Each group of three has a single orange above and below it, and those<br/>make tetrahedra, which are the tetrads of the lattice.</p><p>A nicely stacked pile of fruit makes a pyramid with four sides to it,<br/>and those four sides are the four types of lattice.</p><p>The four edges of the pyramid, together with the two edge<br/>directions that make its base, give the six edge directions of<br/>the lattice.</p><p>Maybe for the web page, I&apos;ll do a vrml of a small stack of &quot;fruit&quot; showing<br/>how this works, with tetrads, triads etc to click on.</p><p>If anyone has any comments about this, especially, anything left out that<br/>one should say for a beginner, or anything that&apos;s unclear, please go ahead!</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=19264 href="#19264">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2001 6:14:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry, got the stack of fruit wrong</p><p>It is a pyramid with three sides and a triangular base, so, a tetrahedron,<br/>and the four faces are the four types of lattice, and the six edges of the<br/>pyramid are the six lattice directions.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=19268 href="#19268">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2001 7:32:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry about the confusion about the fruit stacking lattice.</p><p>Of course, both descriptionsn are correct.</p><p>If you stack fruit, and start with the fruit as close together as<br/>possible in the first layer, so that they make a triangular lattice,<br/>you will end up with a tetrahedron - used for stacking cannon balls<br/>sometimes.</p><p>If you stack them with the first layer in a regular square array<br/>instead, you end up with a square based pyramid, or<br/>the familiar stack of fruit with a rectangular base and a<br/>ridge across the top.</p><p>Naturally, that one is more convenient for a rectangular fruit<br/>stall!</p><p>Both are the same lattice, tilted at slightly different angles.<br/>The tetrahedron has one of the triangular 2D lattices as<br/>its base, and the other one has the square cross section of the<br/>octahedron as its base.</p><p>The one used by greengrocers is particularly good for seeing<br/>the octahedra.</p><p>Each orange is above a square of oranges in the previous row,<br/>and then there is another orange beneath it too, making the octahedron.</p><p>Then each pair of fruit is above another pair in a little four orange<br/>cluster, and those together make the tetrahedra.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
