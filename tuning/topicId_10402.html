Any tone from the set can be chosen as the 1/1. However a big<br/>caveat with the CPS-command in Scala is that the 1/1 in the<br/>resulting scale does not actually belong to the CPS and should be<br/>deleted. This is on purpose (somebody might still like to keep it).<br/>Here&apos;s an example. We&apos;ll create the <a href="http://1.3.5.11">1.3.5.11</a> hexany on 1.11, the<br/>scale file is hexany13.scl (12/11 5/4 15/11 3/2 20/11 2/1).<br/>There are four factors: 1, 3, 5 and 11. A hexany is a 2-out-of-4 CPS<br/>so enter this:<br/>CPS<br/>4<br/>2<br/>1<br/>3<br/>5<br/>11<br/>SHOW<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000<br/>  1:          3/1            1901.955<br/>  2:          5/1            2786.314<br/>  3:         11/1            4151.318<br/>  4:         15/1            4688.269<br/>  5:         33/1            6053.273<br/>  6:         55/1            6937.632<br/>That doesn&apos;t look like it yet. We want to set the 1/1 to the 1.11 =<br/>11/1 tone which is degree 3. However we first have to delete the<br/>current 1/1, so do<br/>DELETE 0<br/>SHOW<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000<br/>  1:          5/3             884.359<br/>  2:         11/3            2249.363<br/>  3:          5/1            2786.314<br/>  4:         11/1            4151.318<br/>  5:         55/3            5035.677<br/>Now what was degree 1 has become 0, so degree 3 is now degree 2.<br/>We move the key to this degree by doing<br/>MOVE/KEY 2<br/>SHOW<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000<br/>  1:          3/11          -2249.363<br/>  2:          5/11          -1365.004<br/>  3:         15/11            536.951<br/>  4:          3/1            1901.955<br/>  5:          5/1            2786.314<br/>We can&apos;t use the normal KEY command because this is not an octave<br/>repeating scale yet. If we had done nothing here then the 1/1 would<br/>have been the first combination, 1.3 = 3/1.<br/>Now we make it octave repeating by doing<br/>NORMALIZE 2/1<br/>SHOW<br/>  0:          1/1               0.000<br/>  1:         12/11            150.637<br/>  2:          5/4             386.314<br/>  3:         15/11            536.951<br/>  4:          3/2             701.955<br/>  5:         20/11           1034.996<br/>  6:          2/1            1200.000<br/>And there&apos;s the scale in hexany13.scl.<br/>You can see the structure by doing<br/>LATTICE/TRIANGULAR 3 5 11<br/>hor &gt; 3/1 - ver ^ 5/1 - hor &gt;&gt; 11/1</p><p>  * * |  *   |<br/> . *  | 0 *  |</p><p>A command file is included, cmd\cpsoct.cmd, to make an octave based<br/>CPS. It assumes the 1/1 will be the first combination.<br/>So, this approach is not ultimately user-friendly, let alone<br/>didactically sound, but as general as possible. Note that the CPS&apos;s<br/>factors don&apos;t have to be integer numbers and can be any cents value.</p><p>Something else, there is a new Linux version of Scala, version 1.61,<br/>which runs under Red Hat 6.x.

On page 3 of the &quot;Letter to John<br/>&gt;Chalmers&quot;, Wilson indicates five possible solutions for a &quot;stellated<br/>&gt;dekateserany&quot;.  (All five are present in the stellated Eikosany.)  It<br/>&gt;appears that the n=2m CPSs will each have single stellations while the<br/>&gt;non-2=2m CPSs  will have m possible stellations.</p><p>Wow- I&apos;d like to see that.  There should be exactly one complete<br/>stellation for every CPS, regardless the proportion of m and n.</p><p>How many tones would they have?  That&apos;s an interesting question.<br/>I don&apos;t suspect the answer would be in Pascal&apos;s triangle.  For<br/>CPS&apos;s with 2:1 m:n, I think the answer is as simple as t + s(c),<br/>where t is the number of tones in the un-stellated structure, c<br/>is the number of un-saturated chords in the CPS, and s is the<br/>number of identities needed to saturate the CPS&apos;s basic chord.<br/>The 14 tones of the stellated hexany make sense here; each of the<br/>hexany&apos;s 8 triads needs 1 extra note.  The something is different<br/>with the 70 tones of the stellated eikosany, tho; each of its 30<br/>tetrads needs 2 extra notes, giving 80, but according to Chalmers<br/>the stellated 1*3*5*7*9*11 eik. has 70 notes.  So either 10 notes<br/>are redundant due to the composite 9-factor, or 10 points are<br/>getting re-used somewhere and my formula is incorrect (which is<br/>unlikely, since the chords of the CPS will already exploit the<br/>maximum number of common-tone relations in prime-factor JI: 2).</p><p>For non-2:1-m:n CPS&apos;s, the answer is more difficult, since s is<br/>not a constant.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10579 href="#10579">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2000 6:48:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John- I think your 70-note structure is correct, since Scala &quot;shows&quot;<br/>the &quot;locations&quot; of the correct number of chords.</p><p>&gt;&gt;How many tones would they have?

Then come back to the Eikosany. If you<br/>&gt;want to &quot;cheat&quot;, look at the factors that make up the notes of the<br/>&gt;Eikosany (3 factors for each note) -- each consonant otonal tetrad will<br/>&gt;have two factors in common to all notes (e.g., A*B*C, A*B*D, A*B*E,<br/>&gt;A*B*F), and each utonal tetrad will have two factors absent from all<br/>&gt;notes (e.g., A*B*C, A*B*D, A*C*D, B*C*D).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Carl -- does that last hint for Joseph help you simplify your formula<br/>&gt;[t + s(c)] any further?</p><p>Hrm...  We already know how to find t; my first thought was to find a way<br/>to express c and/or s as something we know from t.  But I don&apos;t see it<br/>from your clue yet.</p><p>Since I first learned about CPSs, I&apos;ve wanted a way to find the number<br/>of notes in the basic chord of the CPS (which, in the case of the highly-<br/>symmetrical CPSs, gives s when subtracted from the number of factors, n).</p><p>Here&apos;s a try for c:</p><p>c = tn/(n-s)</p><p>8 = 6*4/(4-1)<br/>30 = 20*6/(6-2)<br/>112 = 70*8/(8-3)</p><p>...which shows that the number of chords grows more quickly with respect<br/>to the number of factors than with the tonality diamond.
