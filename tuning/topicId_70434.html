In fact the<br/>&gt; entire low-mass PVC bridge is supported about half a millimetre<br/>above<br/>&gt; the tube by a short PVC pillar glued on top of the 20 mm disc<br/>&gt; transducer which is in turn glued to a flattened area on the tube.<br/>The<br/>&gt; very ends of the bridge are then glued around the back of the tube<br/>to<br/>&gt; stabilise it. So almost all of the static and vibratory forces of<br/>all<br/>&gt; the strings are brought to bear on the piezo disc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These disc shaped piezos are manufactured by the millions as sound<br/>&gt; _output_ devices for electronic equipment. They are dirt cheap,<br/>highly<br/>&gt; linear and need no preamp.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Dave K<br/>&gt;</p><p>I think Max Mathews piezoelectric violin bridge made them bend, the<br/>sounds from bowing when they sense pressure might be better for lower<br/>notes but aren&apos;t unmusical, in my experience anyways.</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3><a id=70578 href="#70578">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2007 4:01:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I sometimes think that if electric guitars were being invented<br/>&gt; for the first time today, no one would bother with magnetic<br/>&gt; pickups, as prone to hum and nonlinearity as they are.</p><p>What about optical pickups?</p><p><a href="http://www.lightwave-systems.com">http://www.lightwave-systems.com</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=70583 href="#70583">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2007 5:06:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I sometimes think that if electric guitars were being invented<br/>&gt; &gt; for the first time today, no one would bother with magnetic<br/>&gt; &gt; pickups, as prone to hum and nonlinearity as they are.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about optical pickups?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lightwave-systems.com">http://www.lightwave-systems.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yeah, I thought about those.

Going from 6 strings to 8, and going from<br/>8.5 mm spacing at the saddle to 10 mm spacing. This has placed the<br/>outer strings 35 mm from the middle of the piezo instead of 21 mm and<br/>there has been a noticeable drop in volume of the top string.
