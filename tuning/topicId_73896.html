With composers there are  some<br/>striking differences.  Those with more attention deficit go the way of  the<br/>chart and brevity (maybe that&apos;s me).</p><p>More egregious to me is using ridicule, whether for a person, or for a<br/>tuning.  Two different instances have just occurred in recent posts.   Why would<br/>someone insult a tuning system?  All intervals are valid for  making music,<br/>requiring only the right artist to make it so.  Noise makes  great music in modern<br/>times.</p><p>Assuming that we are not just rehashers of microtonal trivia, or worse,<br/>rehashers of earlier views of music and intonation that do not stand the test of<br/>time, we have to have the confidence on this List to speak out.<br/>What continually brings me to the List is the opportunity to thrash through<br/>some ideas. Occasionally, there is censoring attempted.  P.C. is not really<br/>better.  We should continue to reward new thinking while  insulting no one.</p><p>It is clear.  We do not all agree on musical matters.  That is  our strength.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div>
