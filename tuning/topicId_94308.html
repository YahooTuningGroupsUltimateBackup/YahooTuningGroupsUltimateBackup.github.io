In that field a theory is a testable explanation of how something<br/>works.&quot;</p><p>   Ah, ok.  But, in the case, is not it true that showing something works<br/>through math alone is not truly a &quot;test&quot;, but doing so in such a way that you<br/>can showing to results in physical reality in easily recognizable form (IE sound<br/>or motion) is?   I start to get the feeling that, in music, the only &quot;real&quot;<br/>theories would be the ones that could be tested in sound and then recognized by<br/>listeners as representing what they say they represent very well.  IE if a chord<br/>is made out in music theory to be a potential resting point or point of tension,<br/>musicians should be easily able to use it as such and get a positive response<br/>from a fair share (if not a clear majority) of listeners in a real-world<br/>double-blind listening test.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Music archeology or music language strikes closer to home in my opinion because<br/>&gt;you can&apos;t really test anything new - you can only explain or demonstrate what<br/>&gt;has already happened.&quot;<br/>   Funny thing to me is, in music, I often find it in reverse IE I can hear a<br/>phenomenon in many cases but not explain it in, say, mathematical form (at least<br/>immediately).    Would you assuming (for the way most people on the list use the<br/>term &quot;music theory&quot;) that you need to have a result in recognizable sonic format<br/>first, one in mathematical format first, that it does not really count until<br/>both have happened/been done, or something else entirely?</p></div><h3><a id=94352 href="#94352">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2010 5:21:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 11/6/2010 3:20 PM, Chris Vaisvil wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Michael,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess I&apos;m still hung up on the word &quot;theory&quot; based upon my<br/>&gt; scientific background.

What I did was take ideas from music theory and apply them in practice. Then this chord progression I used was found to be more generally useful, and inspired a new bit of music theory. I can&apos;t make sense of the phrase &quot;a theory&quot; in this situation. Again, this is &quot;theory&quot; as distinct from &quot;practice&quot;, not &quot;a theory&quot; as in a scientific explanation.

The thing that 15- and 22-ET have in common that allows this progression to work is that the comma 250/243 vanishes. That&apos;s also why it doesn&apos;t work in 12-ET. You&apos;d think you might be able to extend the analogy to work with 12-ET, but it ends up changing keys in an endless climb, rather than being a closed cycle. So I don&apos;t think the idea of &quot;musical analogy&quot; is very helpful here.</p><p>&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sun, Nov 7, 2010 at 8:21 PM, Herman Miller&lt;hmiller@...&gt;  wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; Take the harmonic progression at the end of my Mizarian<br/>&gt;&gt; Porcupine Overture: I knew you could tile copies of 15-ET on a plane<br/>&gt;&gt; (essentially using it as a periodicity block), so I made a cyclical<br/>&gt;&gt; chord progression that made use of that feature.

There<br/>is no corresponding analogy in 12-equal, for example. And the pattern<br/>is that any tuning that eliminates 250/243 works. And if 250/243 is<br/>eliminated, that means that the tuning equates 10/9 (a minor whole<br/>tone) and 27/25 (a 5-limit diatonic semitone + a syntonic comma). This<br/>means that it equates a 5-limit chromatic semitone and the syntonic<br/>comma. So then they just assigned the name &quot;porcupine&quot; to the above<br/>temperament, which 15 and 22 equal both support.</p><p>But you raise another good point, which is that sometimes similarities<br/>exist even between temperaments - the 17-equal pentatonic minor scale,<br/>for example, sounds pretty similar to 12-equal&apos;s, 19-equal&apos;s, and<br/>22-equal&apos;s, and even 27-equal&apos;s, but in some of these the minor third<br/>makes more sense as 6/5 and in other ones it makes more sense as 7/6.<br/>This means that some of them temper out 64/63, and the others temper<br/>out 81/80, but the &quot;analogy&quot; still holds in a sense.</p><p>Why this is is still a matter of open debate and the discussion<br/>generally revolves around how psychoacoustic and cultural factors<br/>interact with one another. Rothenberg&apos;s ideas have been somewhat<br/>influential in this regard.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
