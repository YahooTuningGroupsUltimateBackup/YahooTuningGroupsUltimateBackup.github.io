Music can progress in other directions<br/>through the &quot;technologies&quot; already developed by other musics around the world. India and<br/>Persia have developed meters we haven&apos;t even started to explore. The counterpoint of the<br/>pygmies, or the are&apos;are of the solomon islands remain little understood and despite the<br/>popularity of the Bulgarian Woman choir this harmonic direction lies outside our use. European<br/>music needs to take a hard look at what it doesn&apos;t do that others have develop successfully.<br/>It will find itself neither advanced in pitch or rhythm, nor timbre. i will argue on one level<br/>i find nothing better about european harmony than the others except in one important feature,<br/>Modulation.

If<br/>you have to come up with a scale you are going to have to use the rest of your life or even<br/>for 10 years, you are going to look at what the scale can do much more than if you can delete<br/>it tomorrow morning. All scales are not equal.

I have to<br/>agree that there is more that is musically vital and new happening on,<br/>of all places, the dance floor, than is happening in the average<br/>University Composition Department.  This is not to say that I don&apos;t<br/>think a lot of music on the radio and discos might not be greatly<br/>helped by a serious dose of the Academe, even if it involves a little<br/>instruction in something like serialism, an esthetic I find offensive<br/>and ugly.

However, a lot of<br/>interesting experimentation is going on off the beaten track.<br/>Autechre is so rhythmically irregular that *I* can&apos;t imagine dancing<br/>to it.  Stranger branches of Drum &amp; Base have explored interesting<br/>realms of rhythmic variation that make me fall over.  There&apos;s a great<br/>song from the album &quot;Stalker&quot; by Covenant which could be construed as<br/>4/4 -- it fits on a drum machine -- but is actually a compound rhythm:<br/>3+3+2/8.  It slowly shifts into a standard 4/4.  And some people will<br/>write various melody lines which contradict the 4/4 feeling, though<br/>that&apos;s less common in straight dance music than I might wish.</p><p> &gt;             Its innovation is strictly in the realm of timbre,<br/> &gt;although this is not to be underestimated.</p><p>        Thank you for pointing this out!  This is one of the most<br/>interesting areas in electronic music to me, though one hopes people<br/>will get beyond the standard bandpass filter resonance sweep that is<br/>so pervasive Kim Cascone calls it &quot;western culture&apos;s Tamboura<br/>instrument.&quot;</p><p> &gt;                     i will argue on one level i find nothing better<br/> &gt;about european harmony than the others except in one important<br/> &gt;feature, Modulation. Here is where european music has made the most<br/> &gt;advance and is the very thing that is being discarded first.</p><p>        Harmonic modulation, with only two possibilities for modal<br/>modulation major-&gt;minor or vice versa.  One thing I&apos;m very interested<br/>in right now is modal modulation to more distant *melodic* realms.  In<br/>fact, in a fit of whimsy and inspired by a harpsichord sample set, I&apos;m<br/>trying to write a few two-voice &quot;inventions&quot; (a la Bach) which go<br/>from, say, JI major to some 11-limit thing and back.  Getting my ideas<br/>for modal modulation (a feature, according to Chalmers in &quot;Divisions<br/>of the Tetrachord&quot;, of music in Classical Greece, and certainly a<br/>feature of classical Arabic and Turkish musics) to mesh with harmonic<br/>modulation has been, well, interesting. :)</p><p>        My hope, though, is to take what I&apos;ve learned from the<br/>inventions and apply them to my Electronica, which *I* certainly hope<br/>to hear on a dance floor some day.  I already have planted the seeds<br/>of JI in a friend&apos;s mind... if he ever wants to remix my new music,<br/>he&apos;ll have to learn to cope with alternate tunings. :) If 808 state<br/>can use standard European modulation in Techno (well, they did about<br/>10 years ago), perhaps I can sneak in a little intonational<br/>variation...  That&apos;s my goal, at any rate.</p><p>--<br/>wm</p></div><h3><a id=14527 href="#14527">ðŸ”—</a>William S.

Composers of new music will have to<br/>learn humility and relearn theory, as many on this list have done admirably, or forever<br/>recycle decaying material.

There&apos;s a great<br/>&gt; song from the album &quot;Stalker&quot; by Covenant which could be construed as<br/>&gt; 4/4 -- it fits on a drum machine -- but is actually a compound rhythm:<br/>&gt; 3+3+2/8.</p><p>well all rock uses this</p><p>&gt; It slowly shifts into a standard 4/4.  And some people will<br/>&gt; write various melody lines which contradict the 4/4 feeling, though<br/>&gt; that&apos;s less common in straight dance music than I might wish.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;             Its innovation is strictly in the realm of timbre,<br/>&gt;  &gt;although this is not to be underestimated.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Thank you for pointing this out!  This is one of the most<br/>&gt; interesting areas in electronic music to me, though one hopes people<br/>&gt; will get beyond the standard bandpass filter resonance sweep that is<br/>&gt; so pervasive Kim Cascone calls it &quot;western culture&apos;s Tamboura<br/>&gt; instrument.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;                     i will argue on one level i find nothing better<br/>&gt;  &gt;about european harmony than the others except in one important<br/>&gt;  &gt;feature, Modulation. Here is where european music has made the most<br/>&gt;  &gt;advance and is the very thing that is being discarded first.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Harmonic modulation, with only two possibilities for modal<br/>&gt; modulation major-&gt;minor or vice versa.  One thing I&apos;m very interested<br/>&gt; in right now is modal modulation to more distant *melodic* realms.  In<br/>&gt; fact, in a fit of whimsy and inspired by a harpsichord sample set, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; trying to write a few two-voice &quot;inventions&quot; (a la Bach) which go<br/>&gt; from, say, JI major to some 11-limit thing and back.  Getting my ideas<br/>&gt; for modal modulation (a feature, according to Chalmers in &quot;Divisions<br/>&gt; of the Tetrachord&quot;, of music in Classical Greece, and certainly a<br/>&gt; feature of classical Arabic and Turkish musics) to mesh with harmonic<br/>&gt; modulation has been, well, interesting. :)</p><p>It is in this direction we can best use the european tradition!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         My hope, though, is to take what I&apos;ve learned from the<br/>&gt; inventions and apply them to my Electronica, which *I* certainly hope<br/>&gt; to hear on a dance floor some day.  I already have planted the seeds<br/>&gt; of JI in a friend&apos;s mind... if he ever wants to remix my new music,<br/>&gt; he&apos;ll have to learn to cope with alternate tunings. :) If 808 state<br/>&gt; can use standard European modulation in Techno (well, they did about<br/>&gt; 10 years ago), perhaps I can sneak in a little intonational<br/>&gt; variation...  That&apos;s my goal, at any rate.</p><p>I thought that some of the Aphex twin Ambient 2 CD&apos;s uses some interesting pitch use which i<br/>can&apos;t really tell what it is but nice.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=14532 href="#14532">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2000 2:59:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>William!<br/>    There is a difference between compromise and finding those aspects of one own voice that<br/>communicates to others.

I think<br/>most of us are people writing for other people, as far as history is concerned the outlook is<br/>highly uncertain (to paraphrase Britten:-) )</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         So, I guess, Kraig, I&apos;m all for being true to one&apos;s own and<br/>&gt; uncompromised voice so long as there is some honest assessment of how<br/>&gt; likely it is to be understood and without maligning people who aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; necessarily able (or willing) to hear that voice.</p><p>How do you evaluate such a thing. Corporate market statistical research attempts to do this<br/>and it is not paying off. All music that has lasted started with a small audience and made<br/>other people uncomfortable to start. If one person walks up to you and points out what you set<br/>out to do without prompting, you are communicating. Others will follow.</p><p>&gt; I think this last<br/>&gt; point is what so irritates me about a certain class of composers.  Art<br/>&gt; is not entitled to an audience.  If there is an audience for my music,<br/>&gt; wonderful.  If not, well, I&apos;ll cope.  I sure have no business<br/>&gt; demanding that I be listened to.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         I think I&apos;ve officially veered entirely off topic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; wm</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=14573 href="#14573">ðŸ”—</a>Clark &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2000 7:02:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Dan,</p><p>I caught a couple shows at the Autumn Uprising festival in Boston this<br/>weekend - EED and Undr Quartet don&apos;t stray too far from normal<br/>instruments, but the way they use them! These folks use microtones<br/>explicitly all the time, and Undr Quartet especially, they improvise<br/>intricately contrapuntal music largely using extended techniques. Some<br/>of these might not become general practice (like Greg Kelley scraping<br/>the side of his trumpet with sheet metal, or Dave Gross strumming the<br/>keys on his saxophone with a reed guard!) but they&apos;re more immediate<br/>than, say, learning to play a four-valve trumpet.<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.teleport.com/~mmpco/tptcat/tptcat13.htm">http://www.teleport.com/~mmpco/tptcat/tptcat13.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>Richard Waters and Reed Ghazala&apos;s instruments have reached listeners<br/>outside EMI&apos;s readership, but in some sense like many of the inventions<br/>from those<br/>(sadly bygone) pages they&apos;re far more limited and idiomatic than<br/>traditional Western instruments. The latter survived through evolution<br/>(tuning, timbre, technique, etc...) at least until the 20th century, and<br/>though with some wonderful historical dead ends along<br/>the way, it&apos;s difficult to match their accumulated, empirical<br/>flexibility (even with a Waterphone or Trigon Incantor).</p><p>It&apos;s interesting that the earliest computer music was extended compared<br/>to what has evolved; I forget where, but I read a comment that computer<br/>musicians still are inventing rather than developing virtuosic<br/>technique. Hip hop uses of many of the same musical interfaces mentioned<br/>on this list, and yet perhaps a fluency with these means grows from a<br/>simpler approach rather than modifying parameters, coding macros or even<br/>building from scratch. I think Kraig&apos;s comment about the fixedness of<br/>real, fixed-pitch instruments hints to this, as do many of Neil<br/>Haverstick&apos;s posts about musically understanding instruments. For my<br/>part, the technical make-up of instruments all but has prevented me from<br/>doing anything musical with them!</p><p>Anyways, thanks - this is a thought provoking thread, and I&apos;m looking<br/>forward to that kegger! ;)</p><p>Clark</p></div>
