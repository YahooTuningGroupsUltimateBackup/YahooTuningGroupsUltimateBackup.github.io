A chain<br/>of fifths up from C goes C-G-D-A#, so A# represents 27/16. A 28/27 up<br/>from that is 7/4.

The sharp symbol<br/>&gt; represents 28/27, and the chain continues D-F#-A# ...</p><p>Since two of these 28/27 symbols make up an apotome, it probably makes<br/>more sense to retain # as meaning the apotome, and use another symbol<br/>for the half-apotome. Sagittal has an important symbol, an up arrow,<br/>for an approximate half-apotome of 33/32, and another for the apotome<br/>complement of 729/704. In the 11-limit hemififths (41&amp;58) temperament,<br/>these are the same, and we can notate them in ascii, sagittal style,<br/>by v for the flat direction, and ^ for the sharp direction. Hence we<br/>have a symbol pair which we can take to be various things in<br/>different, related temperaments:</p><p>v, ^ equals:</p><p>27/28 and 28/27 in 7-limit hemififths</p><p>that, and 32/33 and 33/32 in 11-limit hemififths</p><p>392/405 and 405/392 in breed (2401/2400 planar) and ennealimmal<br/>temperaments</p><p>In all these temperaments ^^ = #, vv = b. In hemififths, 15/14 is<br/>equivalent to the apotome: (15/14)/(2187/2048) = 5120/5103. In breed<br/>and ennealimmal of course it is not. If we used # as a symbol for<br/>15/14 in breed and ennealimmal anyway, then in all of these systems<br/>a 7/4 is notated as C-A#, precisely as in meantone. In breed and<br/>ennealimmal, #vv would now become 10976/10935 ~ 5120/5103.</p><p>We now want a symbol pair for 49/50, 48/49 down and 50/49, 49/48 up.<br/>We might use ? up and j down for that, I suppose, though Manuel&apos;s<br/>choice of ), ( seems better for our purpose. In hemififths C-F# is an<br/>interval of 10/7, and iterating this, a Bv## = B^# is a 50/49 in<br/>hemififths, and ) is shorthand. In any of the above, C-E}-G-A# will be<br/>the otonal tetrad, however.</p></div>
