I mentioned this some time ago, namely, that more thought and inevitably,<br/>&gt; writing, of both theory and music, will be needed before we have at least an outline of some of<br/>&gt; the more artful methods of creating lasting higher identity music. Then of course it will be<br/>&gt; suggested that simple tonal practice and its theory are decadent and that an entirely new<br/>&gt; paradigm is to be sought out.</p><p>My own view is that there are invariables in good music, even in good noise/music, and that these<br/>are structural pertaining to form.  Pitch selection is only one of these variables, albeit an<br/>important one. Having said that there is a psychoacoustic consideration to take into account with<br/>the use of higher identities. This concerns the speed or rather the tempo at which we can take in<br/>and process harmonic information. A lot of Western tonal music that I know of chunders along at<br/>fast tempos and modulates as it goes, hinting at the 5 limit most of the time for both melody and<br/>harmony and the 7 limit at cadential points for harmony only. No problems for the listener, the<br/>more exotic cadences adding more tension before release.  If we introduce pitch sets that clearly<br/>outline the 7 and 11 identities we then have a choice of new harmonic AND melodic resources. Does<br/>a composer then treat 7 and 11 as exotic additions to familiar melodic and harmonic structures? If<br/>so then melodies become more interesting and harmonies more crunchy but the framework remains the<br/>same. Or do we vote democrat and liberate 7 and 11, granting them parity, in which case I would<br/>have a problem with processing faster music. But I would be challenged by the vast increase in<br/>resources.</p><p>I would suggest that the more radical and pioneering approach would be to look at 7 and 11 as much<br/>more than extensions of existing structures. (It would help also to demystify the higher<br/>identities, especially 11, by exposing control groups to pronounced 11 limit melodies and long<br/>sustained 7 and 11 limit chords just to prove that you will not in fact convert to Satanism.) In<br/>the mid term the sort of music that would appeal to me would be at slower tempos with more<br/>sustained vertical structures. The art would lie in the formal engineering of the piece. The door<br/>would open to more homophonic music and to modal and dronal techniques which would allow composers<br/>to plunder the riches of pre-tonal theorists.</p><p>On a lighter note, lots of university ne&apos;er- do -wells would either have to re-train or work for a<br/>living : - ) and orchestras and audiences  wouldn&apos;t have to dress up in silly 19th century clothes<br/>and put on affectations. Hopefully opera as we know it would wither and die releasing millions for<br/>meaningful music making.</p><p>Some more thoughts...</p><p>Best Wishes</p></div><h3><a id=22466 href="#22466">ðŸ”—</a>PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</h3><span>5/11/2001 12:40:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So how about some shop talk and miscellaneous gossip from the angle<br/>of<br/>&gt; how to expand tonality.
