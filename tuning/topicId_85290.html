Can it produce and control both consonance and &lt;dissonance?******</p><p>No one scale controls consonance and dissonance. If we tune a piano to a PERFECT SCALE, neither Mephistopheles would impede that the player plays what we call dissonant chords 24 hours a day, actually they do not deserve to be called that way. The dissonant effect that you are probably referring to, precisely comes from the particular amplitude distribution of harmonic components presented by the piano itself. The JUSTHARM scale consonance production is granted  since its foundations rely on K and P semitone factors and M, J commas.</p><p>&lt;********6.

Physics showed that harmonic parameters obey to physical characteristics of the instrument which have no relation with music but they improve its expression. If you replace the piano strings or the hammers, you will notice that harmonic components or overtones have changed; each new partial percentage, or most of them, varied despite the scale is the same.</p><p>I spent some time trying to understand what makes the difference between a practical and a non-practical harmonic rules.

And, for the sake of accessibility to the public, I agree such rules should ideally be fairly simple.</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Mario Pizarro &lt;piagui@...&gt;<br/>To: tuning yahoogroups &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Sun, November 22, 2009 2:10:30 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] IMO-2</p><p>Dear friends,</p><p>Charles Lucy has added four<br/>questions/doubts to what Michael stated regarding my post (IMO) sent last 11/20.</p><p>Charles&apos;questions and my answers follow:</p><p>&lt;********3.
