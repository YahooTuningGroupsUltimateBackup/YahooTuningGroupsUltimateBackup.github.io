I &gt; haven&apos;t seen<br/>&gt; David in many, many years, but we were good friends in the 70s and &gt; 80s. Besides<br/>&gt; the scale work, David was very interested in timbre theory, computer &gt; music,<br/>&gt; computer compositional ideas. We spent many hours together talking about<br/>&gt; everything under the sun. I have a file of several his articles &gt; (including some<br/>&gt; of the stuff on timbre), and will look and see if there&apos;s anything I &gt; can post<br/>&gt; that will help.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I brought him to Mills at one point, and the Mills Contemporary Ensemble<br/>&gt; performed one (two?) of his pieces, and he did a lecture on the &gt; Seminar in<br/>&gt; Formal Methods Series (this must have been the early 80s). Somewhere, &gt; I have a<br/>&gt; tape of that lecture, and there&apos;s a brief description of the talk in &gt; the old<br/>&gt; Leonardo article John Levin and I wrote about that Series (I can send &gt; a hard<br/>&gt; copy of that article to anyone who&apos;d like it).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll look around for materials (scores, tapes, articles), and if &gt; anyone makes contact with David (I&apos;ve lost touch, I&apos;m sorry to say, &gt; David was a warm, funny, brilliant guy with a big heart!), let me &gt; know, and I&apos;ll ask his permission to post some of thematerials I have &gt; of his.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; larry polansky</p></div><h3><a id=66759 href="#66759">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2006 11:21:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Wolf &lt;djwolf@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Good to see all the recent interest in David Rothenberg&apos;s work.

Tanaka was a physicist by trade, but modern physicists are probably not going to recognize much significant in his work, hence a Physics-oriented person will strike him from Wikipedia.  Since the wikipedia tribe is heavily populated with computer scientists, identifying him as a computer scientist might well get him knocked out. Go with music theorist AND information scientist and see what happens...</p><p>DJW</p></div>
