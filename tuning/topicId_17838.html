It was incredibly striking... particularly the first two<br/>pieces, the Beethoven &quot;Pathetique&quot; and &quot;Op. 14 #1&quot; piano sonatas in<br/>the &quot;Prinz&quot; tuning.  Something &quot;spooky&quot; is going on right away...</p><p>Actually, part of the charm is the fact that the pieces on his album<br/>are SO familiar.  Virtually all of us who are pianists have played<br/>them all at one time or another...  We&apos;ve also heard OTHER people<br/>play these time and time and time and time tasdfjaeoirghojf and time<br/>again, so it&apos;s refreshing to listen to them in a different way!</p><p>The Young tunings (That&apos;s Thomas, of course, not La Monte) are also<br/>quite distinguishable, although not as much so from 12-tET as the<br/>Prinz.  Ed explains why in his program notes...</p><p>However, I, personally, hear the difference in mid-to-upper register<br/>chords for whatever reason (??) and sometimes at unexpected times...<br/>I suppose it&apos;s the particular chord that&apos;s ventured upon...</p><p>Striking, also, were the big famous &quot;thump, thump, thump, thump&quot;<br/>chords of the Waldstein...  I heard a more &quot;harmonious&quot; in terms of<br/>5th-partial harmonics, sound in this chord than usual...  Would that<br/>make sense (??)  Anyway, that was quite striking, as well as the<br/>diminished seventh chords at the very end of the piece.  The Young<br/>temperament is extremely obvious there...</p><p>Say, does anybody know a bit about this piece?  I was trying to find<br/>some more info on the Web... but I was wondering about the ending.<br/>At the very end, Beethoven has some chords that sound vaguely like a<br/>&quot;hunting horn.&quot;  Was he making some kind of bad pun on the &quot;Wald&quot; of<br/>&quot;Waldstein??&quot;  Could this be possible??  Does anybody know the<br/>commissioning history of this piece??</p><p>Anyway, anybody at all interested in tuning (a couple around here, I<br/>would venture) should get ahold of this CD.  It makes quite an<br/>impact... at least it did for me...</p><p>_______ _____ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=17857 href="#17857">ðŸ”—</a>a440a@aol.com</h3><span>1/23/2001 6:05:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote stuff and John ask questions:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;&gt;Kirnberger?  The notes say that &quot;Prinz&quot; is used for the first two</p><p>sonatas, and Young for the second two.  Is Prinz essentially the same</p><p>as Kirnberger?</p><p>   Yes,  these tunings have a pure C-E and three full comma thirds across the<br/>top of the circle of fifths.  In the dissonance,  they resemble the<br/>Werckmeister, but the Just third at the bottom of the circle requires a<br/>faster climb into the &quot;color&quot; for the Kirnberger/Prinz/Neidhardt form of the<br/>tuning.</p><p>&gt;  In the case of Young, at least, Kyle Gann makes the</p><p>comment that the difference between it and 12-tET is most apparent to</p><p>the performer.  Do you agree?&lt;&lt;</p><p>   Yes, the performer&apos;s grasp it more quickly, saying it feels like &quot;power<br/>steering&quot;.  Audiences get a taste for well temperament more quickly with the<br/>stronger tunings, if they don&apos;t get scared off by the alien nature of a 21<br/>cent third.</p><p>John again,<br/>&gt;&gt;I meant to mention that: &quot;WARNING: this CD contains pure intervals which</p><p>may be habit forming!&quot;  ;-&gt;</p><p>   Some people regard this a facetious, however, it is there for a serious<br/>reason,(just so I can say ITYS)</p><p>Inre the &quot;Menage a Mozart&quot; that we are including on our next one:<br/>&gt;&gt;I like the fact that you&apos;re including three versions for comparison.  Of</p><p>course, there will also be subtle differences in the three performances,</p><p>difficult or impossible to control in the organic/acoustic world.</p><p>    The difference betwee the Meantone and well tempered versions are great<br/>enough that any difference in play is almost moot. Enid Katahn has a lot of<br/>control, (which is required when one tries to play Mozart with wolves<br/>howling.....)</p><p>&gt;&gt;y own preferences are highly adaptive by now, and that&apos;s</p><p>unlikely to change, I fear.  Tell me, Ed: what are your thoughts on</p><p>the possibility of making a grand piano real-time adaptive, given</p><p>unlimited resources?  I realize there are serious problems, beyond the</p><p>mechanics of turning the tuning pin: the string would have to slip over</p><p>the bridge and the other terminating rail  &lt;&lt;</p><p>   I think a more plausible approach would be to mimic the pedal steel<br/>guitar(the king of all musical instruments!).  It would create a piano that<br/>weighs several tons, and would have at least 30-40 pedals,(driven by a<br/>computer-driven set of servos.)<br/>   If I know musicians, there would be a number of them that would want the<br/>pedals to also be foot-accessible,too, so that they could manually adapt<br/>pitch on the fly,also.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div><h3><a id=17872 href="#17872">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2001 2:57:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ed Foote wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;Yes, the performer&apos;s grasp it more quickly, saying it feels like<br/>&quot;power steering&quot;.&gt;&gt;</p><p>Ha, what an interesting description!</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
