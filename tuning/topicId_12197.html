Saturday 17 May 1969.</p><p>What will I remember of this town: the sound of lawnmowers, the smell<br/>of weekend barbecues in the backyards, the retired military men and<br/>the retired insurance agents who are our neighbors, decent folk with<br/>their red checkered shirts and baseball caps, and the boredom of the<br/>curved streets. Psychologist have discovered that straight streets<br/>make people unhappy, so everything here curves like the halls of the<br/>Queen Mary, meeting other curving streets, all the way to the main<br/>highway.</p><p>On Wednesday I went to Princeton. I was kindly received and the<br/>seminar I gave on information retrieval met with polite applause. Then<br/>a man with intense eyes and silver hair took me aside. We sat on the<br/>benches in the lab next to the lecture hall. He said, &quot;There is a<br/>fundamental fallacy in artificial intelligence, and your falling into<br/>it like everybody else.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In what respect?&quot; I asked with the feeling this discussion was not<br/>going to conform to the usual exchange of generalities heard at most<br/>professional meetings.</p><p>&quot;Artificial intelligence is trying to emulate nature, it wants to<br/>approximate what man does.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What other inspiration is there?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Imitation of nature is bad engineering,&quot; he answered patiently. &quot;For<br/>centuries inventors tried to fly by emulating birds, and they killed<br/>themselves uselessly. If you want to make something that flies,<br/>flapping your wings is not the way to do it. You bolt a 400-horsepower<br/>engine to a barn door, that&apos;s how you fly. You can look at birds<br/>forever and never discover this secret. You see, Mother Nature never<br/>developed the Boeing 707. Why not? Because nature didn&apos;t need anything<br/>that would fly that fast and that high. How would such an animal feed<br/>itself?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What does that have to do with artificial intelligence?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Simply that it tries to approximate man. If you take man&apos;s brain as a<br/>model and test of intelligence, your making the same mistake as the<br/>old inventors flapping their wings. You don&apos;t realize that Mother<br/>Nature has never needed an intelligent animal and accordingly, she has<br/>never bothered to develop one!&quot;</p><p>I could only greet this stunning thought with silence. He went on:</p><p>&quot;When an intelligent entity is finally built, it will have evolved on<br/>principles very different from those of man&apos;s mind, and its level of<br/>intelligence will certainly not be measured by the fact that it can<br/>beat a chess champion or appear to carry out a conversation in<br/>English.&quot;</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2000 9:20:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [D.Stearns]<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12197">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12197</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Willingboro.
