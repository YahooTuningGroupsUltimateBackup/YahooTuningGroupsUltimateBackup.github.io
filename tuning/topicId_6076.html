Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@xxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/1999 10:26:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and I&apos;d like to comment a bit on a recent dialogue about<br/>whether and when, in just intonation, substituting a simultaneous or<br/>vertical interval of 32:25 for a 5:4 major third might be either an<br/>obvious &quot;mistake&quot; or an apt solution. Here I suspect that for an<br/>enthusiastic newcomer to Just Intonation (JI), the problem of the<br/>32:25 may be something of an &quot;in-joke,&quot; a joke more comprehensible<br/>once explained. Here I&apos;ll try to provide a bit of explanation,<br/>warmly inviting further questions, as well as other views.</p><p>First, a disclaimer: this discussion seems mainly directed to<br/>Classic/Romantic music in the major/minor key system, or more recent<br/>music, where concepts of &quot;key&quot; and of &quot;modulation&quot; (in the sense of<br/>moving between major/minor keys) are relevant. As someone mainly<br/>involved with medieval and Renaissance/Manneristic tunings -- mostly<br/>Pythagorean (3-limit just) and meantone, I hope that my response may<br/>complement the views of others involved mainly with later styles.</p><p>Now, I&apos;d like to begin by explaining the &quot;humor&quot; of the 32:25<br/>problem. Objectively, a vertical or simultaneous interval of 32:25,<br/>e.g. a diminished fourth of E3-Ab3 in 5-limit JI, is simply another<br/>possible interval on a vast spectrum. (Here I use C4 for middle C,<br/>with higher numbers showing higher octaves.) In a typical 5-limit<br/>setting, however, it is often considered what is called a &quot;Wolf,&quot; an<br/>interval _not quite_ the same as the one you probably intend. Because<br/>it&apos;s &quot;not quite right&quot; if you expect a 5:4 major third, it can sound<br/>figuratively like the &quot;howling of Wolves,&quot; and thus the name.</p><p>Here&apos;s where a special kind humor or irony may come in. In the<br/>intonation problem being discussed, the use of 5-limit JI would<br/>suggest a special priority of having major thirds at a pure 5:4, as<br/>smooth as possible. Using the system of cents, where a cent is 1/1200<br/>of an octave, and 1/12 octave (an equal semitone of 12-tone equal<br/>temperament or 12-tet) is 100 cents, this pure 5:4 interval is around<br/>386.31 cents.</p><p>Certainly this 5:4 third can be very smooth, indeed captivatingly so,<br/>and ideal for music where thirds (and sixths) are the most favored<br/>intervals, as is true both in Renaissance music starting around 1450,<br/>and in later music of the kind being discussed in this dialogue.</p><p>However, some advocates of JI seem to go further, and will argue not<br/>only that 5:4 is the ideal tuning for major thirds in such music, but<br/>that any tuning substantially different is not really &quot;concordant,&quot;<br/>e.g. the considerably wider major third in 12-tet at 400 cents. Still<br/>wider, and quite active although regarded as _relatively_ concordant,<br/>is the Pythagorean major third formed from four pure 3:2 fifths at<br/>81:64, or about 407.82 cents. In comparison with a 5:4 major third,<br/>one of either 400 cents or 81:64 has prominent beats, at least with<br/>many accustomed timbres of voices and instruments.</p><p>Now for the &quot;prank,&quot; as it were, of musical geometry: three pure 5:4<br/>major thirds, unfortunately, don&apos;t add up to quite a pure 2:1<br/>octave. For example:</p><p>   5:4     5:4     32:25<br/>c   -   e   -   g#   -   c<br/>  386.31  386.31  427.38</p><p>We can tune two pure major thirds, c-e and e-g#, but the remaining<br/>interval to form an octave (2:1, 1200 cents), g#-c, must be a<br/>diminished fourth, definitely larger than a 5:4 major third, and in<br/>fact 32:25 or about 427.38 cents. This is about 41.06 cents larger<br/>than pure, a difference called a &quot;diesis&quot; of 128:125, about 1/5-tone.</p><p>This &quot;bug&quot; -- or, sometimes, &quot;feature&quot; of Renaissance and later<br/>tunings based on pure major thirds -- can complicate problems of<br/>intonation. If you want a normal 5:4, then hitting a 32:25 can<br/>definitely be a &quot;bug&quot; or &quot;mistake.&quot; If you want something very<br/>deliberately &quot;different,&quot; however, then it might be a feature.</p><p>The 32:25 _can_ be a feature, either in 5-limit JI or in what is<br/>called 1/4-comma meantone for keyboards, a popular Renaissance tuning<br/>where each regular fifth is made slightly narrower than a pure 3:2 in<br/>order to permit 5:4 major thirds. Nicola Vicentino (1511-1576), for<br/>example, uses a sonority with a 32:25 above the bass (B2-F#3-B3-Eb4)<br/>to bring out the Italian word _pianger_, &quot;to weep.&quot;</p><p>However, if it&apos;s _not_ intended as a calculated effect, then singing a<br/>32:25 could be a bit of a humorous predicament, especially as judged<br/>by some bystander not necessarily so enthusiastic about 5-limit JI.</p><p>The humor is that the performers are going to such great lengths to<br/>produce _pure_ thirds, and for all their pains, here they are singing<br/>or playing something much more &quot;out of tune&quot; from a conventional<br/>viewpoint than the 12-tet or even the Pythagorean major third! One can<br/>almost hear a proverb: &quot;Extreme (intonational) justice is extreme<br/>injustice.&quot;</p><p>A bit more than 400 years ago, the lutenist and radical music theorist<br/>Vicenzo Galilei (father of the astronomer Galileo Galilei) indulged in<br/>a similar kind of humor in his _Fronimo_ when he pohed fun of lute<br/>players who would add extra _tastini_ or &quot;little frets&quot; to their<br/>instruments in order to play purer thirds. Lutes were generally tuned<br/>in 12-tet, considered acceptable for this instruments because the<br/>strings somewhat &quot;softened&quot; these thirds, unlike the organ or<br/>harpsichord, where meantone with pure or near-pure thirds was<br/>standard. However, some players -- like modern designers and players<br/>of JI guitars -- weren&apos;t satisfied with the &quot;usual&quot; 12-tet, and added<br/>frets for smaller intervals.</p><p>In having his bit of fun, Galilei points out that these players<br/>sometimes touch their extra frets so as to produce very audibly impure<br/>fifths -- likely around 40:27 rather than 3:2, another &quot;Wolf&quot; interval<br/>-- thus showing listeners the true &quot;delicacy&quot; of their ears!</p><p>Such &quot;humor&quot; seems almost inevitable when people try something new, or<br/>different: it&apos;s like seeing an automobile fail to start (let&apos;s say a<br/>solar-powered car, for the sake of the environment) and shouting &quot;Get<br/>a horse!&quot;, or poking fun at a new and very useful piece of software<br/>because of an obvious bug or two.</p><p>To sum up so far: in 5-limit JI or meantone where pure 5:4 major<br/>thirds are the norm, a 32:25 or diminished fourth (spelled, for<br/>example, E3-Ab3 rather than the usual E3-G#3, or A3-Db4 rather than<br/>the usual A3-C#4) is either a rather glaring &quot;bug,&quot; or a deliberate<br/>&quot;special effect.&quot; It can have great &quot;surprise value,&quot; but shouldn&apos;t be<br/>an unwelcome surprise to the musicians themselves.</p><p>In other kinds of tunings and music, however, an interval at or near<br/>32:25 might be quite routine, whether we choose to call it a &quot;major<br/>third,&quot; a &quot;supermajor third,&quot; or something else.</p><p>In Gothic music of the 14th century, for example, where the usual<br/>Pythagorean major thirds are already quite wide and active, some<br/>performers may have used even wider (super)major thirds at cadences<br/>where they expand to fifths:</p><p>G#+3 - A3<br/>E3   - D3</p><p>(Here the &quot;+&quot; means that the G# is somewhat higher than the usual<br/>Pythagorean note, making the melodic semitone G#+3-A even narrower<br/>than the usual compact Pythagorean semitone.)</p><p>Marchettus of Padua (1318) describes the use of such extra-large<br/>thirds, which _might_ in practice have been tuned somewhere near 32:25<br/>(~427 cents) or 9:7 (~435 cents), making cadences even more dramatic<br/>and intense. In this music, fifths and fourths are richly stable<br/>intervals, contrasting with tense although &quot;tolerable&quot; thirds and<br/>sixths -- either Pythagorean, or in some cases &quot;super-Pythagorean&quot; (if<br/>we follow the likely meaning of Marchettus).</p><p>In 20th-century tunings, also, intervals of around 32:25 or 9:7 get<br/>used regularly -- in this case not necessarily as unstable, but also<br/>as pervasive &quot;concords,&quot; as in Gary Morrison&apos;s music based on his<br/>system of 88-cet (88-cent equal temperament), with its supermajor<br/>third of 440 cents, a bit larger than 9:7. This composer has nicely<br/>demonstrated how a supermajor third can be accepted by the ear as a<br/>concord in the right musical setting.</p><p>Also, for example, 17-tone equal temperament (17-tet) has a major<br/>third of 6/17 octave, or ~423.53 cents, quite close to a 32:25.<br/>Depending on one&apos;s stylistic inclinations, one could use this interval<br/>either in a &quot;neo-medieval&quot; manner like that of Marchettus, inviting a<br/>resolution to the fifth, or in Gary Morrison&apos;s manner, as an<br/>independent concord in its own right.</p><p>In addition to explaining the &quot;joke&quot; of hitting a 32:25 in 5-limit JI<br/>(unless it&apos;s a deliberate special effect, so to speak), I have<br/>attempted to give some idea of the range of tunings, historical and<br/>recent, available.</p><p>Again, I warmly invite questions, knowing that explanations of this<br/>kind can be clearer to the author than to the reader, and also that<br/>while I might not be unique in having musical and intonational biases,<br/>the views of others may at least reflect different biases, thus<br/>possibly lending some perspective to the observer in reaching a<br/>balanced judgment.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
