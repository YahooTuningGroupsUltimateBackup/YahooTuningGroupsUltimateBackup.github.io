Clearly that is not what you are<br/>&gt;suggesting.</p><p>Oops!  Consider it done.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;Is there any way to get rid of the springs to &quot;ground&quot;? Isn&apos;t it true<br/>&gt;that all you really need is to &quot;ground&quot; one note, say C, and let the<br/>&gt;rest fall as they may? At least in a piece of music where every note in<br/>&gt;the scale is harmonically connected (directly or indirectly) to the<br/>&gt;overall tonic, which I would think would take care of all pieces of<br/>&gt;interest.</p><p>Now that&apos;s a clever idea; why didn&apos;t I think of that?  (Hey!  Not<br/>funny!).  Maybe start by scanning the entire sequence to establish which<br/>note is most represented, and ground it, either exclusively or at least<br/>more heavily than other notes.</p><p>There would be danger when a piece goes through an extended passage very<br/>distantly modulated from tonic (or whatever note is grounded), that<br/>tuning would drift aimlessly and irritatingly.  In general, though, I<br/>really like the idea of nailing down one pitch and letting the others<br/>find themselves according to the harmonic needs of the sequence.  I&apos;ll<br/>play with adding that capability to the program, and should have some<br/>trial results by Monday, if not sooner.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;What I would think is that, in a pre-19th century piece of music,<br/>&gt;occurences of G# and Ab, though named identically in the MIDI file,<br/>&gt;would occur far enough apart in the music so that they wouldn&apos;t be<br/>&gt;attached with a spring, or at least not a very strong one. As a result,<br/>&gt;the two pitches would come out quite different, as they would in a<br/>&gt;meantone tuning. In fact, I would expect most pre-19th century music to<br/>&gt;_naturally_ approach something close to meantone tuning (if 5-limit is<br/>&gt;the overall paradigm expressed in your tuning files) if this method is<br/>&gt;used.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if you&apos;re right!  And in any case, the results<br/>should be verrrry interesting!!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
