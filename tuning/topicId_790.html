I don&apos;t wish to belabor the point<br/>here, but wouldn&apos;t it simply be safer to accept a broad, inclusive<br/>definition of &apos;tonal&apos; (everything from drones to early Webern) and then<br/>distinguish a &apos;classical&apos;  tonal practice within the broader concept?  This<br/>would be the western European, voice-leading derived,  &apos;common&apos; tonal<br/>practice whose properties, extents and limits have been debated since<br/>Christ left Chicago and will continue to be debated until the cows come<br/>home.</p><p>By the way: Is it just me, or does &apos;dronality&apos; seem to be a particularly<br/>awful neologism?  Aside from the awkward etymology (the word drone comes<br/>from the Greek _threnos_, which was the lyric form usually translated as<br/>&apos;dirge&apos;, so making a new term on analogy with  _tonos_/tonality is a kind<br/>of category error ) , does it really convey anything that couldn&apos;t be said<br/>with something like &apos;static tonality&apos;?</p></div>
