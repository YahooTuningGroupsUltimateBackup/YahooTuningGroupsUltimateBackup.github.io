I tried  them and I like them:    3121222    3131212       2141212.        Will someone suggest what notes to combine together to make chords or at least two notes together to play harmonies?     I have used the scale of     2212231.  I never found very nice chords or two notes together to play harmonically with my scale.  My microtonal instrument is a &quot;steel guitar&quot; of a homemade type.  I can retune each string in thirds or whatever works for the scale I am playing.   Does anyone have some suggestion on what tones go together with 13 tet?

If you are looking for some<br/>nice dissonances, simply improvising in this scale will make great<br/>results (there is no need to consciously avoid tonality as in 12-tet).</p><p>I gather that you are looking for consonant relationships, however.</p><p>1 = 19/18<br/>2 = 10/9<br/>3 = 7/6<br/>4 = 5/4<br/>5 = wolf 4/3<br/>6 = 11/8<br/>7 = wolf 3/2<br/>8 = wolf 3/2<br/>9 = 8/5 or 13/8<br/>10 = 12/7<br/>11 = 9/5<br/>12 = 15/8<br/>13 = 2/1</p><p>Above is one possible just interpretation of 13-tet.  Of these<br/>intervals, the most consonant are probably the 3-step minor third,<br/>followed by the 4-step major third, and the 11-step minor seventh.</p><p>As for triads... the best to my ear is 4:5:9 (13-tet degrees<br/>0-4-15).  You can form a quasi 10:12:15 with degrees 0-3-7 (same<br/>pattern as a minor triad in 12-tet!), and a quasi 12:14:21 with<br/>degrees 0-3-11.  All this depends on the timbre used, naturally.<br/>You&apos;ll have to experiment.</p><p>One approach would be to really exploit &quot;voicings&quot;.  In a tuning<br/>this dissonant, you need to use your octaves!  Don&apos;t be afraid to<br/>consider 6:7:12 a triad, to consider 6:12:7 a different triad, etc.</p><p>&gt;Last week the topic of 13 tones equal tempered scales had three<br/>&gt;scales suggested. I tried them and I like them: 3121222 3131212<br/>&gt;2141212.</p><p>You might also like to try my 10-tone scale 2112112111.  Get a<br/>hold of Xenharmonikon 13, too, if you can.  It has two good articles<br/>on 13-tet harmonic practice.  Chalmers suggests an 8-tone scale<br/>2212212...</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10006 href="#10006">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2000 7:40:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote...<br/>&gt;Chalmers suggests an 8-tone scale 2212212...</p><p>Whoops!  The last 1 got chopped off somehow.  The 8-tone scale is 22122121.<br/>It&apos;s a 5L+3s MOS.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
