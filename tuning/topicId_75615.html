Tom, I agree with you.  And yes,  they were my<br/>words using the Archambault translation.  Werckmeister would  also agree with<br/>you, which is why he offered students different ways to  tune.  Werckmeister<br/>1698 is not a mathematical tuning as you describe  it.</p><p>Brad: D&apos;oh!  While waiting for Paul to respond to a previous posting I  put<br/>some extra work into making my own opinion, rather than sheepishly following<br/>another&apos;s.  Hope you understand.  Seems Paul and I don&apos;t see the same  things<br/>looking at the same information.  That&apos;s exciting and necessary, if  can remain<br/>civil.  You are aces at being civil, and I appreciate  that.</p><p>Paul: Aay!  Welcome back.  Um, you can attack me head on.   Archambauldt is<br/>guiltless.  You see, it is my professional experience as a  performer not to<br/>listen to another&apos;s interpretation before developing my  own.  When I did a<br/>realization of the Charles Ives &quot;Universe Symphony&quot; I  made certain that it was<br/>only my own work, basically refusing to discuss with  other that had their own<br/>set views.  These set views easily become  territory to defend, and it gets<br/>worse from there.  I&apos;d rather be 100%  responsible for my views.  I&apos;ll try to<br/>make some cogent remarks -- and look  past the unnecessary explosiveness.  (Hope<br/>you are a bit kinder with your  actual students.  wink wink ).</p><p>--- In _tuning@yahoogroups.com_<br/>(<a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/post?postID=SnGd96CBFd48hnfX8RMTFzILaOe4fWSS5W5j3sSYI-O5IR_CLPMgPRdDaj6geeTxxYl">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/post?postID=SnGd96CBFd48hnfX8RMTFzILaOe4fWSS5W5j3sSYI-O5IR_CLPMgPRdDaj6geeTxxYl</a><br/>g91YzaBZB7xRHlCpR) , Afmmjr@...  wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Tunas!

There is no possible cause<br/>of confusion.  It even takes in Tom&apos;s views  (yes, Tom?)<br/>Ordinaire sounds too French for a Werckmeister tuning.   Personally, I see an<br/>argument against WVII simply because it is not on the  monochord.</p><p>&gt; I have<br/>&gt; deduced its identity using a  translation by Ellen J.

Johnny</p><p>Paul:  My first thought is, if you want to &quot;deduce&quot;  it&apos;s structure, why don&apos;t<br/>you just sit down and tune it according to  Werckmeister&apos;s quite clear<br/>instructions, rather than relying on some modern  mislead<br/>interpretation?

Unlike you, I am very<br/>comfortable in cents.

The continuo  temperament is far more<br/>difficult to tune than WIII!! Any idiot can tune WIII  with one ear<br/>tied behind his back;<br/>How is this easier?!</p><p>Johnny: I am just trying to arse  some questions.</p><p>&gt; Essentially, it is simpler language for getting  started.</p><p>Bollocks!</p><p>Johnny: It&apos;s easier because:<br/>1. no monochord needed, nor any of the skills associated with  it<br/>2. no intellectual knowledge of commas, etc. of tuning, and  no organs<br/>3. there is a new flexibility in using inexact size fifths  which are<br/>harmonized to Werckmeister&apos;s suggestions<br/>4. no need to refer back to his Musicalische Termperatur  (1691), or pay for<br/>it<br/>5. the white notes of the keyboard are the same as sixth  comma meantone,<br/>which some believe was increasing prevalent<br/>6. is is declared by its creator for non-experts (there are  plenty of<br/>quotes).<br/>7. It&apos;s easier because there is intended leeway for errors  which the<br/>Monochordo temperaments did not have</p><p>That&apos;s a start.</p><p>Paul:  1/6 Syn. comma is but one of the tempered  fifths that will work. It<br/>could be anything from about 1/5 Syntonic to 1/7  Pythagorean and still<br/>work.</p><p>Johnny: I believe it had to be something.  I give good  reasons why I think a<br/>schisma of 2 cents is a good way to go for the majority  sixth comma<br/>intervals.  Besides, why fly in the face of sixth comma  (Telemann, Silbermann, Tosi,<br/>Frederick the Great).  Even if you want to  quibble, there is nothing to be<br/>heard from the others.  Besides, even  further, it had to be something!</p><p>&gt; It is likely a nod by  Werckmeister to the realities<br/>&gt; on the ground.</p><p>Paul:  It is  much more likely to be a nod by this modern author to the<br/>current fad for  thinking that 1/6th comma meantone is some sort of<br/>default late 17th/early  18th century temperament.</p><p>Johnny:  You&apos;re half right.  I am, by definition, a  modern author, but I am<br/>not the only one.  And yes, like Monzo, and many  others on this List, I think<br/>sixth comma had a long bout as the basic tuning of  the orchestra until the<br/>20th century.  It had to start sometime.   Werckmeister 1698  showed me that<br/>this might be the first description of  any sixth comma tuning, if only<br/>partially.  The partial part might be more  because of his need to close the circle in<br/>improvisation, and a different  aesthetic.</p><p>&gt; Besides, they would need the odder<br/>&gt;  intervals for improvisation that Buxtehude, Werckmeister, and  Bach<br/>needed.</p><p>I suppose they is a typo for &quot;they woundN&apos;T need&quot;.  Bullkrap again. It<br/>is quite easy to push the Contiunuo scheme to a point  where it is<br/>actually BETTER than WWIII in providing distant keys; in it&apos;s  mildest<br/>version, it only has ONE Pythagorean major third, whereas WIII  has<br/>three. Ugh!</p><p>Johnny:  Ugh! You misunderstand, rewrite me, and still  make a rude noise.<br/>(why do i bother.)<br/>There is no need to deny me, or anyone on this list there  experience.<br/>Werckmeister would have wanted it that way.</p><p>Buxtehude, Werckmeister, and Bach were exemplary improvisers,  who needed a<br/>full circle on the organ to think and play freely.  They also  need to visit<br/>different areas of the circles in order to entreat different  sounding<br/>intervals, but not necessarily wolves.</p><p>Unlike you, I do not believe that the German aesthetic in the  Bach cities in<br/>its environs was for an irregularity in tuning, and a closed  circle.  It was<br/>not about Tom&apos;s idea of trying to get home to just  intonation at all times<br/>possible.  Odd intervals sound great for what they  are.  Everyone on this List<br/>should understand that.  Why else explore  different tunings.  With names<br/>like Werckmeister, Kirnberger, &amp; Forkel  expressing the banality of equal<br/>temperament, it is important to supply the  tuning to the music.  Leaving<br/>Werckmeister 1698 as having its majority of  fifths somewhere between fifth comma and<br/>seventh comma, with the others equally  flexible in bandwidth might mean<br/>something really special to you as a  harpsichord tuner.  I have a different<br/>interpretation.  As already  expressed, these different tunings (which you may call<br/>temperaments) are loved  by their populations for their irregularity.</p><p>&gt; They<br/>&gt; might not rally around depicting gloomy  sentiments.</p><p>Paul: Cute but pointless.</p><p>Johnny: Not pointless to a professional improviser at the  organ.  I&apos;d like<br/>to put the passion back into St. Matthew&apos;s Passion.   All we have is equal<br/>temperament.  All of the alternatives are better than  equal temperament.  The<br/>music is not played the same way.  Faster  tempos are faster in equal<br/>temperament.  Slow movements seem to slow in  equal temperament.  No variation.</p><p>&gt; The eventual scale, in<br/>&gt; comparison with the  primary tuning of Musicalische Temperatur<br/>(1691), or<br/>&gt; Werckmeister III  tuning, demonstrates they sound much alike with no<br/>more than six<br/>&gt;  cents difference, and on only one note, A. The other distances  are<br/>much<br/>&gt; less.</p><p>Paul:  This is where this author shows her  real ignorance. One does not<br/>compare historical temperaments by how much the  individual notes of<br/>their &quot;scales&quot; differ, but rather by how much the major  and minor<br/>TRIADS differ.</p><p>Johnny:  Ever hear of heuristics?  Different ways  to tackle problems?  I<br/>don&apos;t do things like you.  You don&apos;t do things  like me.  This does not mean that<br/>only one of us can be right and the other  must be wrong.  But I do listen<br/>differently than you do, I&apos;ll bet.</p><p>I am the one that works with cents, and made the  deduction.  Nowhere did I<br/>claim that only my interpretation was  accurate.  I understand you are coming<br/>from a different place, a different  profession, and that you see a flexible<br/>bandwidth with the W1698.  Let  us agree not to denigrate the ignorant...more<br/>humble, at least fake it.</p><p>sincerely, Johnny</p><p>**************It&apos;s Tax Time!

If he had ONE &quot;something&quot; in<br/>mind, he wouldn&apos;t need to leave all this flexibility, obviously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is likely a nod by  Werckmeister to the realities<br/>&gt; &gt; on the ground.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:  It is  much more likely to be a nod by this modern author to the<br/>&gt; current fad for  thinking that 1/6th comma meantone is some sort of<br/>&gt; default late 17th/early  18th century temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny:  You&apos;re half right.

All we have is<br/>equal<br/>&gt; temperament.</p><p>Uh, I don&apos;t know what you mean by that. As a tuner for the Nederlands<br/>Bach Vereeniging, which does a huge St. Mat tour every year, all with<br/>original instruments, I&apos;ve tuned for and heard more &quot;passionate&quot;<br/>passions than I care to think about. We&apos;ve done WIII, Vallotti, a<br/>modified Vallotti, and several different Neidhardts. The majority of<br/>the musicians preferred the Neidhardts.</p><p>We never tried equal.</p><p>&gt; All of the alternatives are better than  equal temperament.  The<br/>&gt; music is not played the same way.  Faster  tempos are faster in equal<br/>&gt; temperament.  Slow movements seem to slow in  equal temperament.  No<br/>variation.</p><p>Right.

Different ways  to tackle<br/>problems?  I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t do things like you.  You don&apos;t do things  like me.  This does<br/>not mean that<br/>&gt; only one of us can be right and the other  must be wrong.  But I do<br/>listen<br/>&gt; differently than you do, I&apos;ll bet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am the one that works with cents, and made the  deduction.<br/>Nowhere did I<br/>&gt; claim that only my interpretation was  accurate.  I understand you<br/>are coming<br/>&gt; from a different place, a different  profession, and that you see a<br/>flexible<br/>&gt; bandwidth with the W1698.</p><p>That&apos;s all very fine and good, it&apos;s when you start making comments<br/>like 1698 &quot;was easier&quot; for it&apos;s target audience than WIII, when I<br/>don&apos;t think anybody who ever mimicked the target audience, that is,<br/>sat down and tuned them both on a keyboard instrument, would agree.<br/>It&apos;s just more work, a more complicated structure, and more trouble<br/>balancing. And when you reject judging the temperament by triad<br/>quality, you are rejecting Werckmeister himself, who gave a table of<br/>the thirds for WIII and kept harping about the quality of the thirds<br/>in the 1698 instructions. Neidhardt also give tables of major and<br/>minor thirds for all his temperaments. You can do what you want, of<br/>course, but if it is going to have any relevance to old music, which<br/>you seem to want to do, you ought to at least try judging the<br/>temperaments the way the old guys did.</p><p>Have you ever tried making a monochord, by the way, and actually using<br/>it to temper a harpsichord? I have, and I can tell you it&apos;s not nearly<br/>as easy nor as accurate as the old texts would have us believe,<br/>especially not with a 2 foot string like many of them suggest. The<br/>slightest bit of error in marking out the ruler, the slightest bit of<br/>error in bridge displacement, the slightest flexibility in the<br/>structure, the slightest change of tension as you push the string<br/>against the bride, and the whole thing goes wanky. The ear is a far<br/>better tool, as long as the instrument is fairly bright, like a harpsi<br/>or as W recommends a regal.</p><p>I dunno, Johhnie. I&apos;m beginning to see that you have an emotional<br/>attachment to WIII, and just like dinosaur bones, the presence or<br/>absence of any real evidence is of little importance to you.

And that the<br/>white notes can all be the same as  the white notes in sixth comma meantone.</p><p>Paul:  Again, have you ever TRIED to set  it on a harpsichord or a regal,<br/>Johhnie? Try it on what it was designed for  in the way it is described<br/>instead of tooting your various horns according to  cents deviation<br/>charts before making all sorts of pronouncements about which  is easier.</p><p>Johnny: I bet no one in the world has tried it  except for you and someone<br/>you helped to tune it.  Am I right?<br/>There must be some grace period to trying it out  once it has been deduced.<br/>Isn&apos;t there a union call on this?</p><p>Paul: Ah, the old myth of the 55 comma division =  1/6 meantone? Telemann,<br/>for one, specifically said NOT to do this. BTW, what  did Freddie say<br/>about this? Any evidence?</p><p>Johnny: For starters Freddie was in  meantone.  His flutes were built with<br/>subsemitones, if I can borrow a  keyboard term for a woodwind.  As long as there<br/>is no argument that Freddie  was playing flute in meantone, I will get back<br/>soon with the sixth comma  argument.</p><p>&gt; Even if you want to quibble, there is  nothing to be<br/>&gt; heard from the others. Besides, even further, it had to be  something!</p><p>Why?</p><p>Johnny: Because the musician wants it to be one  thing.  It&apos;s the musical<br/>thing to do.  The musician doesn&apos;t want to  tune it differently each time.  &quot;Oh,<br/>let&apos;s make this not higher this  time.&quot;  And for a continuo that<br/>inconveniences lots of other  musicians.</p><p>And when it is heard, in real time performance,  the keyboard is plastic in<br/>its tuning.  Other than slippage, heat, aging,  and the usual whine of pitch<br/>dangers, there are no flexible fifths bandwidth of  anywhere from a fifth to a<br/>seventh of a comma.</p><p>That&apos;s why I dispatched Brad&apos;s comments about  your work.  I admire you for<br/>it.  However, I must work with it in a  way that is best for the natural growth<br/>of my idiosyncratic path.  Hands on  with Werckmeister&apos;s instructions gave me<br/>a sense of sixth comma meantone quite  strongly.  Quarter comma to me is 696<br/>cents.  If you think it is  something else, please, let&apos;s hear it.</p><p>696 cents is an old familiar interval for  me. When in 1698 W. says he thinks<br/>them lame, even though they are built  into WIII, two cents less flat would<br/>be the right accommodation.  If  an oboist tuned to the 1698 tuning one day,<br/>and it is different on the  second, and still different on the third, you are<br/>messin&apos; with that oboist&apos;s  head.</p><p>To me this &quot;continuo&quot; tuning (I&apos;m not sure about  this yet because the tuning<br/>is in an addenda to the continuo treatise) may not  be so great.  Are you<br/>sure the addenda says the word continuo at least  once?</p><p>Paul:  Do you mean &quot;it had to be ONE thing&quot;?  I think not. It is OBVIOUSLY<br/>undefined as to the basic size fifth, which is  why he gives all that<br/>flexibility about the number of almost pure and wide  fifths, and<br/>doesn&apos;t pin down the last fifth F-C. If he had ONE &quot;something&quot;  in<br/>mind, he wouldn&apos;t need to leave all this flexibility, obviously.</p><p>Johnny:  Another read is that it was a way  to communicate to amateurs.<br/>Okay, not such a flat fifth.  If the  lowest fifth was constantly heard as the 696<br/>cent fifth, which many of us  moderns love, than 698 is the first clearly<br/>variegated pitch.  I have known  about bandwidth theories for years and have<br/>usually poopooed them.  But now  I&apos;m dealing with one from Werckmeister.</p><p>Why wouldn&apos;t the tuner learning Werckmeister 1698  tune it the same way for<br/>themselves each time the tried it?</p><p>Paul:  Uh, I don&apos;t know what you mean by  that. As a tuner for the Nederlands<br/>Bach Vereeniging, which does a huge St.  Mat tour every year, all with<br/>original instruments, I&apos;ve tuned for and heard  more &quot;passionate&quot;<br/>passions than I care to think about. We&apos;ve done WIII,  Vallotti, a<br/>modified Vallotti, and several different Neidhardts. The majority  of<br/>the musicians preferred the Neidhardts.</p><p>Johnny:  This is fantastic news!  Do  you have or know of available<br/>recordings of St. Matthew&apos;s passion in any tuning  but equal?  I want to buy!  Of<br/>course they&apos;d have to start the whole  piece in D minor instead of the usual E<br/>minor.</p><p>Paul:  We never tried equal.</p><p>Johnny:  Good for you!  Any of the ones  you tried would be better than equal<br/>temperament for a Bach passion.</p><p>Paul: That&apos;s all very fine and good, it&apos;s  when you start making comments<br/>like 1698 &quot;was easier&quot; for it&apos;s target  audience than WIII,</p><p>Johnny:  Blah, blah, blah, of course.   Can&apos;t wait to tune it for myself.<br/>And yes I made a primitive  monochord.  And yes, I know it is hard to get the<br/>exact pitch hear it and  apply it, especially to an organ.  And W. only had a<br/>model on one, after  all. I am not fighting the old arguments.  I am making new<br/>ones.</p><p>Paul: ..., the slightest flexibility in  the<br/>structure, the slightest change of tension as you push the  string<br/>against the bride, and the whole thing goes wanky. The ear is a  far<br/>better tool, as long as the instrument is fairly bright, like a  harpsi<br/>or as W recommends a regal.</p><p>Johnny: Reminds me of tuning a chinese sheng with  wet wax dripped on the<br/>tongues in Pythagorean tuning.  When Brad Catler  would put the pipes in its<br/>holder, the pitches would change.  We spent  hours getting the pitches to be right<br/>when the instrument was all put  together.</p><p>Re W. 1698, I don&apos;t know right now a single piece  of music that would be<br/>appropriate to be heard in it.  Do you?</p><p>Paul: I dunno, Johhnie. I&apos;m beginning to see  that you have an emotional<br/>attachment to WIII,</p><p>Johnny:  I do to the spelling of my  name.</p><p>Paul:  and just like dinosaur bones, the  presence or<br/>absence of any real evidence is of little importance to you. As  you<br/>say, we&apos;re coming from different places, aiming at different  goals.<br/>Happy Trails, Ciao, P</p><p>Johnny:  You might say that I have the  ability to see past the lack of<br/>evidence, until different evidence becomes  visible.</p><p>**************It&apos;s Tax Time!

I don&apos;t like it.  It makes music sound awful whenever it gets beyond two flats in the signature, and it&apos;s not great with three or more sharps in the signature either.  It&apos;s trivially easy to do on harpsichord, but that&apos;s not a compelling reason to DO it on harpsichord.  It&apos;s trivially easy to give a kid a haircut with four straight snips of scissors, too, but it&apos;s going to be a bad haircut.</p><p>The Werckmeister 1698 continuo temperament is trivially easy, too, especially if one is bringing any experience from setting a tasteful regular meantone anywhere in the 1/5 to 1/6 comma range (which takes 8-10 minutes, tops, to do a whole 8-foot set of strings).  Narrow the 5ths gently and check that the major 3rds come out a little bit sharp, to taste; duh.  Nine of the twelve notes are already in place.  To convert a regular layout of this type to that Werckmeister 1698, just crank up the G# a little bit higher (making C#-G# either slightly narrow or slightly wide, to preference, testing Ab-C), bring Eb down until it&apos;s just barely wide from that G#, and then fit Bb so it&apos;s slightly wide from Eb and pure (or nearly so) from F.  Three minutes, tops, to convert all the G#-Eb-Bb on an 8-foot set of strings.  I did it again this afternoon just to remind myself how easy it is.  The result still sounds crappy in the same four major triads that traditionally sound crappy in any regular meantone, but more gently.  That is, instead of really solving that problem it merely tames it a bit.  It&apos;s still usable as a modified meantone (9 regular notes, 3 modified notes finessed).  And it sounds way better than WIII, on harpsichord.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/15/2008 1:03:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Brad:  Successfully tuning the easy WIII  only &quot;several&quot; times?!

Brad may have the  Stockholm Syndrome with all the<br/>attacks you have given him, but my background is  Brooklyn.</p><p>Brad:   The Werckmeister 1698 continuo  temperament is trivially easy, too,<br/>&gt; especially if one is bringing any  experience from setting a tasteful<br/>&gt; regular meantone anywhere in the 1/5  to 1/6 comma range (which takes<br/>&gt; 8-10 minutes, tops, to do a whole 8-foot  set of strings).</p><p>Pail:  Right again, although it is important to  point out that this<br/>experience is exactly what the beginner does NOT bring.  As<br/>Werckmeister literally says, the beginner often does not even know<br/>what  a &quot;tempered keyboard&quot; is.</p><p>Johnny:  That must be why Werckmeister  sacked the beginner with an even<br/>harder venture.  One thing the two of you  erudite harpsichordists have missed is<br/>that amateurs and beginners have plenty  more time to do their tuning.  They<br/>would not be harmed by the extra time  they needed to check things.  For that<br/>matter, it should be expected that  amateurs and beginners would need to check<br/>their work in many different  ways.  The mere fact that have the fifths could<br/>be anywhere from a fifth to  a seventh of a comma flat indicates to me that it<br/>wasn&apos;t that critical.   This is not as serious an affair lacking any specific<br/>goal (as the temperaments  of 1691 demonstrate).</p><p>Brad:   Narrow the<br/>&gt; 5ths  gently and check that the major 3rds come out a little bit sharp,<br/>&gt; to  taste; duh.

For weeks I have been asking<br/>piano tuners, friends, scholars, etc, which is  easier to tune quarter comma<br/>meantone or WIII.  Besides guessing, no one  without experience could offer<br/>anything convincing.  The tuners all said  they were the same because each tuning<br/>takes the same time to do it well.   That was surprising so I didn&apos;t want to<br/>get into which is mechanically easier to  tune.</p><p>That mechanical ease is irrelevant to the  outcome.  1698 appears quite<br/>vague, eager to please, an extra thrown in  with a new book, one of many.  The<br/>description directions are so wishy  washy that there are many acceptable<br/>results...not true WIII.</p><p>Pohl: How crappy they sound depends a lot  on which size of basic fifth you<br/>use. The instructions do not specify  anything, though logically there<br/>is a limit.</p><p>Johnny:  I bet when you get to the crappy  fifths your eyes goes ballistic<br/>and you begin to sweat uncontrollably.   Voices in your head scream, &quot;No! No!&quot;<br/>and you run away from the harpsichord as  quickly as your feet will take you.</p><p>Pill:  Johhny steadfastly refuses to  learn what that term [modified<br/>meantone] means, even though<br/>you are now the  third (I think) person to give him a reasonably<br/>precise illustrative example.

From a microtonal<br/>view, with all music considered  microtonal, it is a useless term.</p><p>This is not a court room.  And it is not an  insane assylum.  We are here to<br/>discuss things that are important to  us.  Rather than jab at my interest in<br/>recategorizing for a specific  purpose of understanding the musical conditions<br/>in Bach&apos;s world, what should I  care if Brad and Pool think my idea is crappy.<br/> About the same as they  think the music is crappy, I guess, not.  This is<br/>not an ideal way to  approach these matters.</p><p>1698 is only less elementary to you because it  takes more time to explain<br/>and to fulfill.  There is more to  consider.</p><p>Re Modified Meantone: it reminds me of a harsh  review Rudolf Rasch wrote<br/>about Gardner Read&apos;s new book on Microtonal  Notation.  Rudolf was hitting Garder<br/>hard for not explaining where the  notation came from, its pedigree.  Read<br/>did this intentionally, and was  quite upset.  I do understand both positions.<br/>However, you may not  understand that I would have agreed with Gardner.  It is<br/>not important to  the musician where the notation comes from, only what it<br/>is.  Rudolf is not  a musician so it is understandable that he would think that<br/>more was  needed.  But I play music of 1200 tones per octave and direct others<br/>to do  likewise.  I don&apos;t care where the note came from, only how it sounds<br/>among  its mates.</p><p>Brad:  &gt; And it<br/>&gt; sounds way better  than WIII, on harpsichord.</p><p>Johnny:  Value judgment.  That&apos;s  it.  You call crappy what makes 31-tone<br/>equal temperament so  beautiful.  Have either of you ever heard 31-ET?  It&apos;s<br/>gorgeous stuff,  and so is much quarter comma meantone.  Charles Lucy likes this<br/>fifth,  no?  Modern aesthetics are inathema to the realities on the ground.<br/>Have you heard the sharp quartertone harmonies in Haiti?  How about  the harsh<br/>Appalacian music?  Do your international language skills  inform you about the<br/>meaning of Inuit music?  How are your Sapmi joiking  skills.  Don&apos;t repeat<br/>any prominent intervals there!</p><p>Poil:  Johhny is of course free to enjoy  whatever sounds turn him on, and to<br/>find beauty in whatever dissonant clashes  may appear.</p><p>Johnny:  That&apos;s one for Varese and  Xenakis!</p><p>Paul:  However, when he<br/>starts saying  things like W 1698 is &quot;easier&quot; to set than WIII,<br/>especially for a beginner,</p><p>Johnny: This would be a lie since I never said  that.

I said that Werckmeister  always referred his readers to the<br/>monochord and Musicalische Temperatur (1691)  for greater tuning detail.  This was<br/>true past 1698, to include his  posthumously published book. The monochord<br/>clearly made it easier for some to  conceptualize the different tunings.

Why have you been asking<br/>everyone about 1/4 comma?</p><p>You see, having that pure major third to set the confines of the first<br/>four fifths is already a great advantage. Secondly, after having<br/>manipulated only three notes to get 4 uniformly tempered fifths, you<br/>can tune all the rest of the notes by setting pure major thirds. NO<br/>MORE TEMPERING, thus. In any other flavor of meantone (excepting 1/3),<br/>you don&apos;t have either of these advantages, so they naturally take<br/>longer to set.</p><p>&gt; Besides guessing, no one  without experience could offer<br/>&gt; anything convincing.  The tuners all said  they were the same<br/>because each tuning<br/>&gt; takes the same time to do it well.</p><p>Actually if they had been thinking clearly enough they would have said<br/>they take the same amount of time because the process is identical. In<br/>both cases, you establish a limit and uniformly temper the four fifths<br/>within it. This tempering is precisely the same amount of work in both<br/>cases. In both cases, ALL of the rest of the notes are established by<br/>tuning pure intervals; the only difference is that in WIII you do most<br/>of it at the beginning, and in 1/4 mean you do most of it at the end.<br/>But just about anyone can tune pure thirds as quickly as pure fifths,<br/>including all the amateurs I&apos;ve ever worked with.</p><p>&gt;  That was surprising so I didn&apos;t want to<br/>&gt; get into which is mechanically easier to  tune.</p><p>Not surprising at all when you realize the above.

Here&apos;s your own words regarding the 1698:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/75568">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/75568</a></p><p>&quot;Werckmeister directed this amendment towards beginners in tacet<br/>recognition that organs will always need to be tuned by trained<br/>professionals.  Werckmeister once again attempted to aid the more<br/>na&Atilde;&macr;ve readers in the actual tuning of a harpsichord...This new 1698<br/>tuning was not included on the published copper-plate monochord, and<br/>it was distinguished from its predecessors for being easier to tune,<br/>and without having to split commas.  Essentially, it is simpler<br/>language for getting started...The audience for this new tuning is<br/>would not be expected to understand the intricacies to tune any other<br/>way.&quot;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Piel:  or that WIII requires the use of  a<br/>&gt; monochord,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: Why do you behave as if we are running  for office?  Why put<br/>words in<br/>&gt; my mouth?</p><p>In:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/75615">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/75615</a></p><p>Johnny, in explaining why W1698 was easier to tune (oops! sorry, I<br/>forgot yo never said that) than WIII said the following:</p><p>&quot;Johnny: It&apos;s easier because:<br/>1. no monochord needed, nor any of the skills associated with it<br/>2. no intellectual knowledge of commas, etc. of tuning, and no organs<br/>3. there is a new flexibility in using inexact size fifths which are<br/>harmonized to Werckmeister&apos;s suggestions<br/>4. no need to refer back to his Musicalische Termperatur (1691), or<br/>pay for it<br/>5. the white notes of the keyboard are the same as sixth comma<br/>meantone, which some believe was increasing prevalent<br/>6. is is declared by its creator for non-experts (there are plenty of<br/>quotes).<br/>7. It&apos;s easier because there is intended leeway for errors which the<br/>Monochordo temperaments did not have&quot;</p><p>I specifically direct the reader, including the author of these very<br/>words who unfortunately no longer seems capable of remembering that he<br/>penned them, to reason No.1</p><p>&gt; I said that Werckmeister  always referred his readers to the<br/>&gt; monochord and Musicalische Temperatur (1691)  for greater tuning detail.</p><p>No you didn&apos;t, you said &quot;no monochord was needed&quot; for 1698, which is<br/>logically implies that a monchord IS needed to tune WIII</p><p>&gt; The monochord<br/>&gt; clearly made it easier for some to  conceptualize the different tunings.</p><p>I don&apos;t think any monochord diagram or values make it easier to<br/>conceptualize any tuning or temperament, quite the contrary; they are<br/>intended to assist the REALIZATION of same, precisely as Neidhardt<br/>says. As simple table of &quot;schweben&quot; in fractions of a comma is far<br/>more illustrative in conceptualizing a system of tuning an intrument.<br/>Werckmeister himself says:</p><p>&quot;Meanwhile, by means of a monochord demonstration, one gains the<br/>certainty and guidance of how the ear can tackle the problem, in that<br/>with our monochord, the different manners of tempering and tuning can<br/>be found out.&quot;</p><p>In other words, it is for training the ear, not the mind.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pisl:  Whatever his arguments may be  in<br/>&gt; general for a preference among the Bach circle for WIII, this sort  of<br/>&gt; stuff undermines everything he says because it is so obviously  false.<br/>&gt; Ciao, P<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: And with this the discussion is  closed.</p><p>In short, Johnny is in fact completely out of ammunition.</p><p>Well, then, in closing I would only say should one want to argue that<br/>WIII represents the epitome of Werckmeister&apos;s temperament theorizing<br/>in terms of providing the best possible solution to the problems of<br/>performing music of his time and place, the fact that he did NOT<br/>present it in the 1698 treatise is indeed a very difficult stumbling<br/>block, especially in light of the fact that the work is specifically<br/>intended  to set the reasonably accomplished though inexperienced<br/>keyboard player on the right path to begin tackling the complicated<br/>task of realizing continuo. Logically there is no reason why he would<br/>saddle the reader with a more complex solution which is more difficult<br/>to implement if it were musically less useful. Perhaps a convincing<br/>argument can be made; time will tell.</p><p>Happy Trails.</p><p>P</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/16/2008 4:17:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul, can you show in simple steps how to tune this W1698 on a piano?

That&apos;s  it.  You call crappy what makes<br/>31-tone<br/>&gt; equal temperament so  beautiful.  Have either of you ever heard 31-ET?</p><p>Uh, let&apos;s DO try to stay on point, Johnny. We were discussing Bach and<br/>Werckmeister. As far as I knew, neither one of them had anything to do<br/>with a 31 note per octave instrument. 12 is the unfortunate<br/>restriction. Another indication that you are out of real things to<br/>say: dragging in tangentially related though specifically<br/>inconsequential aspects.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul:  However, when he<br/>&gt; starts saying  things like W 1698 is &quot;easier&quot; to set than WIII,<br/>&gt; especially for a beginner,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: This would be a lie since I never said  that.</p><p>Memory lapses, Johnny? Here&apos;s your own words regarding the 1698:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/75568">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/75568</a></p><p>&quot;Werckmeister directed this amendment towards beginners in tacet<br/>recognition that organs will always need to be tuned by trained<br/>professionals.  Werckmeister once again attempted to aid the more<br/>na&Atilde;&macr;ve readers in the actual tuning of a harpsichord...This new 1698<br/>tuning was not included on the published copper-plate monochord, and<br/>it was distinguished from its predecessors for being easier to tune,<br/>and without having to split commas.  Essentially, it is simpler<br/>language for getting started...The audience for this new tuning is<br/>would not be expected to understand the intricacies to tune any other<br/>way.&quot;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Piel:  or that WIII requires the use of  a<br/>&gt; monochord,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: Why do you behave as if we are running  for office?  Why put<br/>words in<br/>&gt; my mouth?</p><p>In:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/75615">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/75615</a></p><p>Johnny, in explaining why W1698 was easier to tune (oops! sorry, I<br/>forgot yo never said that) than WIII said the following:</p><p>&quot;Johnny: It&apos;s easier because:<br/>1. no monochord needed, nor any of the skills associated with it<br/>2. no intellectual knowledge of commas, etc. of tuning, and no organs<br/>3. there is a new flexibility in using inexact size fifths which are<br/>harmonized to Werckmeister&apos;s suggestions<br/>4. no need to refer back to his Musicalische Termperatur (1691), or<br/>pay for it<br/>5. the white notes of the keyboard are the same as sixth comma<br/>meantone, which some believe was increasing prevalent<br/>6. is is declared by its creator for non-experts (there are plenty of<br/>quotes).<br/>7. It&apos;s easier because there is intended leeway for errors which the<br/>Monochordo temperaments did not have&quot;</p><p>I specifically direct the reader, including the author of these very<br/>words who unfortunately no longer seems capable of remembering that he<br/>penned them, to reason No.1</p><p>&gt; I said that Werckmeister  always referred his readers to the<br/>&gt; monochord and Musicalische Temperatur (1691)  for greater tuning detail.</p><p>No you didn&apos;t, you said &quot;no monochord was needed&quot; for 1698, which is<br/>logically implies that a monchord IS needed to tune WIII</p><p>&gt; The monochord<br/>&gt; clearly made it easier for some to  conceptualize the different tunings.</p><p>I don&apos;t think any monochord diagram or values make it easier to<br/>conceptualize any tuning or temperament, quite the contrary; they are<br/>intended to assist the REALIZATION of same, precisely as Neidhardt<br/>says. As simple table of &quot;schweben&quot; in fractions of a comma is far<br/>more illustrative in conceptualizing a system of tuning an intrument.<br/>Werckmeister himself says:</p><p>&quot;Meanwhile, by means of a monochord demonstration, one gains the<br/>certainty and guidance of how the ear can tackle the problem, in that<br/>with our monochord, the different manners of tempering and tuning can<br/>be found out.&quot;</p><p>In other words, it is for training the ear, not the mind.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pisl:  Whatever his arguments may be  in<br/>&gt; general for a preference among the Bach circle for WIII, this sort  of<br/>&gt; stuff undermines everything he says because it is so obviously  false.<br/>&gt; Ciao, P<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny: And with this the discussion is  closed.</p><p>In short, Johnny is in fact completely out of ammunition.</p><p>Well, then, in closing I would only say should one want to argue that<br/>WIII represents the epitome of Werckmeister&apos;s temperament theorizing<br/>in terms of providing the best possible solution to the problems of<br/>performing music of his time and place, the fact that he did NOT<br/>present it in the 1698 treatise is indeed a very difficult stumbling<br/>block, especially in light of the fact that the work is specifically<br/>intended  to set the reasonably accomplished though inexperienced<br/>keyboard player on the right path to begin tackling the complicated<br/>task of realizing continuo. Logically there is no reason why he would<br/>saddle the reader with a more complex solution which is more difficult<br/>to implement if it were musically less useful. Perhaps a convincing<br/>argument can be made; time will tell.</p><p>Happy Trails.</p><p>P</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>Yahoo!

But if you<br/>really want to, go ahead and give it a spin.</p><p>&gt; assume it involves 1/5 comma tempering of fifths making up the C major<br/>&gt; scale.</p><p>Rationally I cannot exclude 1/5th comma from the list of<br/>possibilities, though I think it is at the narrow extreme of the<br/>range. 1/6th or 1/7th would give more gentle &quot;harsh&quot; keys. But go<br/>ahead and start with 1/5th if you feel you don&apos;t need to tame the<br/>wolves too much.</p><p>&gt; How does one calculate 1/5 comma tempering by ear?</p><p>Any rational tempering of the Syntonic comma (i.e. simple fraction)<br/>can be realized by ear by simply doing exactly what the fraction<br/>indicates, the numerator indicating the number of commas to be divided<br/>and the denominator the number of divisions, or in other words, the<br/>number of 5ths which will be uniformly narrowed to arrive at a<br/>cancellation of exactly one comma. In any case, use this technique:</p><p>Assuming you are starting from C (common practice in earlier times),<br/>set E pure to it. This establishes a virtual correction of one<br/>Syntonic comma; virtual, because you haven&apos;t yet tempered any fifths,<br/>but the mere fact that the third is pure means it&apos;s position<br/>represents one which requires the elimination of one S comma.</p><p>Now that you have your comma, you proceed in dividing up the<br/>correction among the required number of fifths. If it is 1/4, you&apos;re<br/>all set to go, just temper C-G-D-A-E uniformly without touching C or<br/>E. If you want 1/5, first tune B pure above E, which gives you a chain<br/>of five (4 virtual + 1 real) pure fifths minus a Syntonic comma, which<br/>is the very definition of 1/5th comma meantone: minus one comma spread<br/>out over five fifths. All you have to do now is temper the five fifths<br/>C-G-G-A-D-E-B without touching C nor B in the process. Of course, you<br/>will have to retune the E you originally set pure.</p><p>This little trick works for anything: 1/6th, 1/7th, even (with a<br/>twist) Young&apos;s 3/16th comma. If you want to do bi-comma meantones,<br/>like 2/7 or 2/9, again, just do what the fractions tell us: tune TWO<br/>pure thirds, one atop the other, and you&apos;ve established two S commas.<br/>Then either expand or contract the virtual chain of fifths by one<br/>fifth, and use those notes as your extremes.</p><p>All that said, we should not forget that Werckmeister said he didn&apos;t<br/>want to get into specifying any (fraction of a) comma, so an<br/>irrational division would be completely kosher as well, as long as it<br/>was between about 1/5th S comma and 1/8th P comma, and as long as all<br/>of the fifths between C and C# are uniformly tempered (the latter<br/>being clearly stated by W).</p><p>Beyond that, let your fancy be your guide. Read Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>instructions and play with the variations allowed for by the width of<br/>the wide fifths, their number, and the quality of the final fifth F-C.<br/>Contrary to Johnny&apos;s assertion, I believe that Werckmeister would have<br/>had no qualms whatsoever with tuning it slightly differently each<br/>time, depending upon the harmonic requirements of the literature at<br/>hand. Personally, I would favor solutions in which F-C is the same<br/>size as the fifths in the main sequence, but that&apos;s just my opinion.<br/>If you don&apos;t have to play a lot of adventurous literature that<br/>evening, tune it more towards 1/5th with more wolfy thirds out in the<br/>wide fifth zone. This gives you better natural key thirds and the<br/>possibility of sharper contrast if you stray into the minefield. On<br/>the other hand, if you have to do some nasty transposition, up or down<br/>a minor third, for example, to accompany someone playing a wind<br/>instrument built at another pitch, tune it more towards 1/8th P comma,<br/>and the wolf thirds will all but disappear (certainly much better than<br/>in WIII).</p><p>Do let us know what flavors you end up with, what music you try, and<br/>what you think of it.</p><p>Have fun!</p><p>P</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2008 9:35:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Poletti&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Generally I don&apos;t recommend that people try historical tunings on a<br/>&gt; piano, unless it is an historic piano, say pre-1830 or so.</p><p>Why on earth not?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
