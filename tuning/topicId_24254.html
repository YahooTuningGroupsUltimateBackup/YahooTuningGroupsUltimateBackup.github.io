Basically, in my fantasy<br/>scenario, all musicians would first be taught the basic concepts of<br/>where tunings come from, for example, the ratios of the harmonic series,<br/>5ths based tunings, tunings from geometrical shapes, and on and on. The<br/>properties of these systems would be investigated (do they have good<br/>3rds, 5ths, etc, can you play harmonically or just melodically), and<br/>then, with our incredible 300 note keyboard, each tuning would be<br/>demonstrated, and students could hear the actual sound of any possible<br/>tuning, played by a master performer, who was also a brilliant composer,<br/>fluent in all possible tunings. Then, each student would be free to<br/>choose which system/systems they were most drawn to, and have their<br/>chosen instrument(s) built to order in that system. I think that would<br/>be very cool...the variety of music in the world would be assured, and<br/>the infinite nature of tuning systems would be emphasized, much to the<br/>benefit of composers worldwide.<br/>    I do, indeed, wish something like this would happen in the music<br/>schools of the world...as I&apos;ve mentioned, Reinhard and crew play in all<br/>sorts of tunings, and they have inspired me to want to achieve a similar<br/>goal. It&apos;s a hard process, but very worthwhile, I feel...it makes the<br/>musical horizons limitless...Hstick</p></div>
