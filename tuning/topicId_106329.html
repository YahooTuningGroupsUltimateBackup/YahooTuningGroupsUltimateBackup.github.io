This is no fun.</p><p>I finally got to play on an actual Terpstra at Queens college. I absolutely<br/>loved it and shot some footage of myself and my buddy Tyler playing it,<br/>which the Terpstra folks asked if they could edit into a video for the<br/>campaign.

There is no longer any doubt in<br/>my mind that the future of 21st century music is different tunings. You can<br/>see at one point in the video where I&apos;m playing this 31-edo meantone thing,<br/>and then I decide I want to end the phrase with the chord 2:3:5:7:9:11 from<br/>the harmonic series... so I just do it. Just being able to do stuff like<br/>that was pretty mind-blowing.</p><p>It was also pretty crazy to teach my buddy Tyler what a &quot;comma pump&quot; is and<br/>watch him figure out Hanson comma pumps in like 20 seconds. It was a really<br/>eye-opening experience to be like &quot;11-limit harmony sounds like this&quot; or<br/>&quot;this is what a comma pump&quot; is and have another musician next to me<br/>immediately &quot;get it.&quot;</p><p>Wait, you folks on diykeyboard don&apos;t know what these terms mean? Well, you<br/>tell me which makes more sense: is it the jargon on this page (<br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/comma+pump">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/comma+pump</a>), or the example of the chord<br/>progression I play at 0:58 here (<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=QUJ2oND3cdg#t=58">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=QUJ2oND3cdg#t=58</a>).<br/>Never mind, don&apos;t answer that :)</p><p>Ordinarily, this is where I&apos;m supposed to explain that full-row-rank<br/>matrices define musical temperaments, and the null space of one of these<br/>matrices corresponds to the set of vanishing unison vectors, etc etc. Or, I<br/>can just play an example of one, so you can just hear that these are<br/>Escher-style chord progressions that suddenly land you back to the I chord<br/>when you don&apos;t expect it, which was the point anyway. As a staunch internet<br/>microtonalist who&apos;s struggled for years to explain this stuff, that was<br/>pretty unbelievable :)</p><p>The keyboard itself:</p><p>I was playing on a pretty old, busted prototype. Most of the issues that<br/>came up were on the end of the old softsynth we had the thing plugged into<br/>- some custom Max/MSP patch they wired up. I&apos;m talking about stuff like<br/>19-EDO not being set up all the way isomorphically, latency issues, etc. I<br/>mentioned this to Dylan and he said that they were aware of this, and that<br/>in the future there&apos;s going to be a better synth hooked into the Terpstra<br/>anyway, so that doesn&apos;t bother me.</p><p>The prototype I was playing on was an old first-gen prototype, and it was<br/>old enough that there were a couple of mechanical issues - sometimes the<br/>magnetic keycaps would fly off if you hit them at the right angle, and some<br/>of the keys were &quot;dead,&quot; and others would sometimes stick. I mentioned<br/>those Dylan and he said he was already aware of those issues - they&apos;ve<br/>already changed the design to go with a different type of non-magnetic<br/>removable keycap because of that very issue, and they&apos;ve already fixed the<br/>dead/sticking key issue by redoing the key mechanism. I wasn&apos;t phased too<br/>much by any of that, since I knew anyway in the beginning that the<br/>prototype I was playing on was an old beat up first-gen thing that they&apos;d<br/>redesigned anyway. So, I got what I expected and was glad to know Dylan was<br/>already on top of everything. None of that didn&apos;t change my opinion of the<br/>keyboard.</p><p>Ironically, the issue that came through most in the video is that the<br/>action seemed &quot;loud,&quot; but in real life that wasn&apos;t an issue at all. It just<br/>came through more in the video because my buddy was filming me on a crappy<br/>iPhone camera, and the sound was coming out of this dinky little speaker on<br/>the other side of the room, so after we brought the volume up the keyboard<br/>ended up sounding louder than it did IRL. I don&apos;t work for Terpstra and I<br/>just filmed this for fun, so it isn&apos;t like I had a $10k camera with me, but<br/>anyway, YMMV.</p><p>Despite all of that, this thing blew my mind. I was just able to play all<br/>of this exotic new tuning stuff whenever I wanted. I&apos;ve been waiting for a<br/>high-quality instrument to let me do this for a long, long time, and now<br/>that I&apos;ve gotten to play on one it&apos;s like it&apos;s made the whole thing &quot;real.&quot;</p><p>I am 100% behind this project, and think everyone would benefit from one of<br/>these, even the cheaper 1-octave version if it&apos;s all they can afford. I<br/>hope the campaign succeeds, because I think this type of music, as well as<br/>alt-keyboard design, will grow by leaps and bounds if it does. And again,<br/>I&apos;m not affiliated with Terpstra or anything: I just asked if I could play<br/>the prototype and they agreed, and then in return I let them use my video<br/>in their promotional campaign (for free, I wasn&apos;t paid or anything).</p><p>The campaign needs about 5 more people as of this writing, so here&apos;s hoping<br/>my very candid review makes an impact.</p><p>Two thumbs up from me.</p><p><a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/terpstra-keyboard-280-color-changing-continuous-controllers">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/terpstra-keyboard-280-color-changing-continuous-controllers</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=106331 href="#106331">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor@...</h3><span>11/5/2013 2:06:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike, your remarks &amp; especially your enthusiasm for the generalized keyboard bring back memories of 1975, when I first got to play a generalized-keyboard Scalatron.
