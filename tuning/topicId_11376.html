Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>8/7/2000 2:16:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and while a project prevents me at the moment from<br/>participating in some Tuning List threads as much as I would like,<br/>please let me offer a brief reply to some questions from Joseph<br/>Pehrson about the nature and purpose of &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; music.</p><p>(The question of 9:12:16 is something I look forward to addressing<br/>after I finish this stage of my project -- and greetings to George<br/>Kahrimanis, with whom I might exchange some reflections about the<br/>close temporal proximity between Ugolino of Orvieto&apos;s proposal for a<br/>17-note Pythagorean octave and Nicholas of Cusa&apos;s favorable view of<br/>the Pythagorean paradigm of a heliocentric solar system.)</p><p>First of all, Joseph, I very much agree with the view that Pythagorean<br/>or similar tunings can be used for many varieties of music, not only<br/>for European medieval or derivative styles. The various Pythagorean<br/>systems of China, Persia, and other musical cultures quite distinct<br/>from those of Gothic Europe should confirm this point.</p><p>Further, I consider it a point very much worthwhile making &quot;early and<br/>often,&quot; because I would not want to leave people with a certain tacit<br/>impression that Gothic or neo-Gothic is the one &quot;correct&quot; way to use a<br/>Pythagorean tuning -- even in the context of European and derived<br/>styles, let alone that of world musics generally.</p><p>The importance of this point becomes all the more clear when I see<br/>statements which seem to make categorical assumptions that anyone<br/>tuning Pythagorean -- or more likely the almost identical 53-tone<br/>equal temperament (53-tet) -- is taking 5-limit just intonation (JI)<br/>as their model. I would be equally ill-advised to invite the<br/>impression that a Gothic or neo-Gothic style is inherent in tunings<br/>which lend themselves to many purposes.</p><p>Indeed, 5-limit JI schemes based on 53-tet and the like are a very<br/>healthy antidote to any impression that a Pythagorean or similar<br/>tuning structure implies a medieval or neo-medieval style. I hope that<br/>discussions of Xeno-Gothic or more generally neo-Gothic music may<br/>likewise help to illustrate the diversity of styles possible.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that the reason I use Pythagorean tunings, or<br/>tunings such as 22-tet for that manner, to play in Gothic or<br/>neo-Gothic styles is that I love Gothic music and have played this or<br/>improvised in similar styles for over 30 years, on keyboards of<br/>various kinds (yes, often by default in 12-tet).</p><p>This certainly doesn&apos;t mean that because I use these tunings for<br/>medieval European and related styles, this is what everyone else<br/>interested in these tunings should do also. In fact, if other people<br/>use these tunings for whatever music captures their passion and seems<br/>to fit the intonational structure more or less, that would be a most<br/>desirable consequence, quite apart from my own desire to promote<br/>enthusiasm for Gothic and neo-Gothic styles.</p><p>Now we come to an important question you have raised: why the label of<br/>_Xeno_-Gothic to describe a 24-note Pythagorean tuning which may seem<br/>closer to original medieval practice than to a &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;alien&quot;<br/>departure from it?</p><p>Possibly this label may reflect my historical orientation, which<br/>prompts me to caution that indeed a 24-note Pythagorean tuning<br/>designed for rendering certain intervals a Pythagorean comma wider or<br/>narrower than usual, at the performer&apos;s discussion, is something &quot;new&quot;<br/>or &quot;strange&quot; when set against the known period practice.</p><p>As far as I know, a 17-note Pythagorean tuning is the limit of<br/>medieval theory, and it remains an open question whether keyboards of<br/>this kind were actually built in the late 14th or early 15th<br/>century.</p><p>Above all, the use of Pythagorean tuning to obtain major intervals<br/>a comma wider than usual and minor intervals a comma narrower than<br/>usual in &quot;closest approach&quot; resolutions (m3-1, M3-5, M6-8, m7-5, M2-4)<br/>is a &quot;new&quot; and &quot;strange&quot; nuance, even if the often elusive remarks of<br/>Marchettus of Padua (1318) about cadential intonation may provide some<br/>scintilla of historical rationale.</p><p>The modified Pythagorean tunings of the early 15th century producing<br/>&quot;smoothed&quot; major and minor thirds involving written sharps -- actually<br/>diminished fourths and augmented seconds -- offer another partial<br/>precedent, and I consider the use of these intervals for the music of<br/>this epoch to be a &quot;standard&quot; performance practice rather than &quot;Xeno.&quot;<br/>Even when I lean toward a more &quot;experimental&quot; approach, say a tuning<br/>of 15 or 16 notes permitting discretionary use of both C# and Db, for<br/>example, I would call this &quot;an adventurous interpretation&quot; but not<br/>quite &quot;Xeno.&quot;</p><p>However, going beyond 17 notes and using a major third or sixth a<br/>comma wider than the regular 81:64 or 27:16 is for me &quot;Xeno,&quot; whatever<br/>aesthetic inspiration Marchettus may lend; here my theoretical source<br/>is not any medieval treatise, but the modern theorist John Chalmers,<br/>who called to me attention the fact that Pythagorean can approximate<br/>7-limit intervals. Given my orientation to Gothic music, it may not be<br/>surprising that I quickly associated these intervals with Marchettus<br/>and medieval cadences.</p><p>Thus I call the music both Xeno, to emphasize this _is_ a modern<br/>development, and Gothic, to emphasize the grounding in such<br/>traditional 3-limit musical assumptions as the principle of &quot;closest<br/>approach.&quot;</p><p>Also, Xeno-Gothic style can involve some novel progressions which I<br/>wouldn&apos;t immediately associate with Gothic music but may be based on<br/>kindred if slightly altered musical patterns. For example, consider<br/>this progression in regular Pythagorean intonation, shown in a<br/>MIDI-like notation with C4 as middle C, with the rhythmic signs at the<br/>top showing a 2/2 or 2/4 meter:</p><p>1  2 |1   2  | 1<br/>F4    E4  F#4  G4<br/>D4    C#4      D4<br/>B3    A3       G3<br/>G3    A3       G3</p><p>Here the first sonority G3-B3-D4-F4 suggests a resolution to the<br/>stable fifth A3-E4, like this, a progression with at least close<br/>analogues in the 13th century:</p><p>         F4   E3<br/>         D4   E3<br/>         B3   A3<br/>         G3   A3</p><p>(m7-5 + M3-1 + m3-5 + m3-1)</p><p>The progression of the outer minor seventh to a fifth might be<br/>taken as the &quot;guiding&quot; two-voice resolution, with the three unstable<br/>thirds resolving in the usual manner to unisons or fifths. The<br/>diminished fifth B3-F3, regarded as a strong dissonance, adds tension<br/>and color, and behaves typically like a &quot;counterfeit&quot; fifth, often<br/>progressing by parallel or similar motion to a concordant fifth (as<br/>here) or fourth.</p><p>In our actual progression, however, this resolution is both delayed<br/>and diverted. The minor seventh indeed contracts to a fifth, but<br/>instead of A3-E3 we have what is called a _quinta fissa_ or fifth<br/>&quot;split&quot; by a middle voice into two thirds, A3-C#4-E4. The major third,<br/>especially in connection with the accidental alteration, suggests<br/>resolution to a fifth, and this is what happens -- after the upper<br/>voice accentuates this expectation by moving to F#4, a major sixth<br/>inviting expansion to the octave.</p><p>This brings us to the complete trine G3-D4-G4, a point of repose.<br/>While the opening G3-B3-D4-F4 could have been resolved in a &quot;standard&quot;<br/>13th-century fashion, and the last two measures alone have a<br/>characteristically 14th-century sound, the juxtaposition seems to me<br/>&quot;new,&quot; and maybe &quot;Xeno.&quot;</p><p>Note that here the &quot;Xeno&quot; aspect involves the musical progression<br/>itself, not the intonation, which could be achieved on a standard<br/>12-note Pythagorean keyboard in Eb-G#.</p><p>In other instances, the music may be standard Gothic but the<br/>intonation &quot;Xeno&quot; -- as when a major third before a fifth is made a<br/>comma wider than the regular 81:64. Even here, note that the medieval<br/>concept of &quot;closest approach&quot; may give a better idea of what is going<br/>on than the simple intonational label &quot;near-9:7.&quot;</p><p>To sum up, I might define Xeno-Gothic and more generally neo-Gothic<br/>music as involving an interaction between Gothic or Gothic-like styles<br/>and new tunings -- with 24-note Pythagorean being a new tuning in<br/>relation to known medieval practice based on 17 or fewer notes per<br/>octave.</p><p>In celebrating and indeed promoting a practice, I do have concerns in<br/>more than one direction.</p><p>First, I am concerned that it be clearly understood that Gothic,<br/>Xeno-Gothic, and neo-Gothic styles are only _one_ possibility for the<br/>tunings I discuss: 24-note or larger Pythagorean, 17-tet, 29-tet,<br/>22-tet, etc.</p><p>Secondly, I would like often to emphasize that I play in Gothic or<br/>Xeno-Gothic and Neo-Gothic styles because I love the music, a taste<br/>that goes back long before my awareness of the richness that<br/>alternative intonations have to offer.</p><p>Finally, having offered these cautions and comments, I do also hold to<br/>the opinion that Gothic music has not yet gained full recognition as<br/>one great historical practice based on 3-limit JI, a practice with its<br/>own vocabulary of vertical progressions which suggest musical<br/>possibilities maybe not so often considered.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
