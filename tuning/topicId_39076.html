Thanks for adding this analogy.  Of course, I<br/>would have preferred it in &quot;standard&quot; 72-tET notation!  :-)</p><p>That&apos;s more *your* business, but I *do* have one suggestion that you<br/>might agree with:</p><p>I think it would be more effective if you would run *different<br/>colors* up and down the bicycle chains.  Then one would see them<br/>immediately.  I think it would make a striking *visual* statement.</p><p>Great to have links to &quot;real world&quot; bicycles, too.  Very fun.</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
