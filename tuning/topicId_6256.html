In my brash, younger days I tuned several<br/>Steinways down a quarter-tone for various concerts. The then head tuner at<br/>Indiana specifically asked me to do it, only don&apos;t tell him I did, and also,<br/>don&apos;t let him know that I pulled it back up to pitch, and don&apos;t tell him how<br/>frustrating it is. I&apos;ve never worried about the change in tension since, in<br/>the Midwest, if you tune a piano to standard pitch in January, bu June it&apos;ll<br/>be a very generous quarter-tone higher. If I break a string in the process,<br/>well, it&apos;s just piano wire and can be replaced. We did make sure the<br/>soundboards were um, sound, and I&apos;d hesitate to muck with a piano that had<br/>acquired some pedigree.<br/>I achieved enough stability for the concert by giving it my brute force<br/>treatment the day before. I lowered the thing half again farther so that, by<br/>the time I finished, it was pretty much in the ballpark. Then I&apos;d do the<br/>fine tuning.<br/>Of course it was a chore, stabilizing it for the next concert, but I didn&apos;t<br/>care. I&apos;d do anything to further rarely heard contemporary music.<br/>He also didn&apos;t wanna know of the preparations for the John Cage pieces. What<br/>a boss! To let this brash experimenter run free like that.<br/>And zoh! You have the same tape I have. By<br/>any chance did you preserve it on, say, a high-bias cassette or even, on<br/>open-reel? I compiled mine from tapes I made on two mismatched machines and<br/>then, onto an unremarkable cassette. A better copy would be a daymaker-type<br/>thingy.<br/>Also, Joe, I&apos;m aware of how much time it would take to key in a MIDI file of<br/>that, but oh my! What a<br/>boon for us blind folks. We can look at the sequence with speech<br/>synthesizers, and, so long as tempo changes are in the tempo track and the<br/>real notation&apos;s preserved we have a usable score. Orpheus would blessya<br/>plenty and keep you from Hades.<br/>I might even sendya a cd of some fabulous music.<br/>Jay<br/>At 03:46 PM 11/17/99 EST, you wrote:<br/>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Clark, that&apos;s what I had thought.
