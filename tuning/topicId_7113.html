If I am to understand this correctly, it<br/>means that pitches would have to be constantly &quot;retuned&quot; in order to affect<br/>a legitimate JI interpretation of Schubert in 5-limit.  This retuning would<br/>have to be virtually instantaneous, something perhaps a synthesizer and<br/>sequencer could do... or on the other hand, non-tempered instruments which,<br/>I believe is what Daniel Wolf was getting at.  If I understand his posts,<br/>they seem to be suggesting that Schubert is sometimes ALREADY played in<br/>5-limit JI by non-tempered instruments...  So, although Schubert is a<br/>&quot;closed 12-tone system,&quot; perhaps other things are going on in live<br/>performance.  In any case, I would certainly like to hear some<br/>intentionally &quot;retuned&quot; Schubert if anyone has done it... maybe it&apos;s a job<br/>for the intrepid Johnny Reinhard and his micro band... although conceivably<br/>he has already done this.  (I&apos;ll check the archive &quot;playlist.&quot;)</p><p>Thanks again for the help and definitions.  Also, regarding the use of the<br/>term &quot;pun,&quot; so far I&apos;m finding your suggestion of &quot;homophone&quot; to be much<br/>more satisfactory.  If there was so much consternation concerning the word<br/>&quot;microtone&quot; there should even be MORE legitimate questioning of the term<br/>&quot;pun.&quot;  I really don&apos;t see how one can escape the inherent sense of irony<br/>and sometimes humor in the term.  The only drawback with &quot;homophone&quot; would<br/>be a possible confusion with the musical term &quot;homophonic,&quot; but that usage<br/>is now so clearly defined that probably it wouldn&apos;t be a problem.</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=7131 href="#7131">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Because of the standard _diatonic_ pun, pitches would have to be<br/>constantly retuned in order to affect a legitimate JI interpretation of<br/>_any_ common-practice Western composer. But the range of retuning would be<br/>larger with Schubert than with most of his predecessors, because Schubert<br/>would be using a large measure of _enharmonic_ puns as well (e.g., G#=Ab).</p></div><h3><a id=7132 href="#7132">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

It is these puns in the CPS that can<br/>keep the tonality constantly suspended yet consonant. But I feel I am missing<br/>something. In the CPS structures, these puns or multiple meanings are organized<br/>as a structural feature in that how a note is used determines where you are in<br/>the structure. The opposite functions or puns are always at the most dissonant<br/>points in the structure. It is something that is learned after some familiarity<br/>of the structure.

When harmony is reduced to a matter of pushing notes around on<br/>&gt;staff paper, then what those figures might mean is given short change. When<br/>&gt;one hears a chord, knowing that it has function a in key x, and then suddenly<br/>&gt;discovers with the following chord that that it has taken on a completely<br/>&gt;different function b in key y, or when one hears a chord with multiple<br/>&gt;meanings get resolved in an unexpected way, then you&apos;re really at the height<br/>&gt;of classical tonal practice.  The affect of such moves can be surreprising,<br/>&gt;tragiddical, pyronic, even punny...</p><p>Could you give an example of a CPS doing this?

Daniel was talking about<br/>the kind of &quot;pun&quot; where G is a 3/2 in the key of C and yet it is a 1/1 in<br/>the key of G. Paul Hahn wouldn&apos;t call this a pun, since it&apos;s not that a<br/>single pitch is implying two different pitches, though it is taking on two<br/>different functions (albeit relative to two different keys).</p></div><h3><a id=7193 href="#7193">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
