Our bodies have &apos;ears&apos; and their<br/>associated<br/>&gt;mechanisms to experience that vibration as sound. Light , and colour , is<br/>&gt;also<br/>&gt;a vibration but its frequency is more in the region of 562, 949, 953,  421<br/>,<br/>&gt;321<br/>&gt;cycles a second. Each colour has its own frequency  , just like pitch.<br/>&gt;So , in one sense , you could say that colour (or light ) is simply a sound<br/>&gt;that is<br/>&gt;so high that you need a different bodily organ to perceive it (the ear is<br/>&gt;only<br/>&gt;designed for certain frequencies) , or , alternatively , sound is simply<br/>&gt;light of<br/>&gt;such a low frequency that it cannot be perceived by the eyes</p><p>A further thought on this light vs sound idea.<br/>Forgive me if it is a little off  topic for this list.<br/>When a frequency is doubled in its vibration, we have a rise in pitch of an<br/>octave. In theory , if the doubling continues (for between 34 and 45 further<br/>octaves) , our &apos;sound&apos; will now be perceived by our eyes in the form of<br/>colour/light.<br/>It should be possible , therefore , to &apos;transpose&apos; , for example , a J.S.<br/>Bach<br/>prelude up the required number of octaves so that it is perceived visually<br/>as<br/>an intricate and harmonically balanced &apos;light- show&apos; . Dissonances would<br/>show as colour clashes and harmonies as colour compliments.<br/>Perhaps in the future we may be playing our favourite optical C.D&apos;s at the<br/>end of a busy day instead of , or as well as  , aural C.D&apos;s.<br/>Anyway , just a thought.<br/>If there is anything glaringly obviously wrong with my sound / light<br/>frequency relationships , please let me know. I am by no means a<br/>scientist , or a mathematician. I am barely a musician.</p><p>Buddhi</p></div><h3><a id=14870 href="#14870">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

First of all, they are completely different physical phenomena.<br/>Sound is longitudinal pressure waves (which is why there is no sound in<br/>space), while light is transverse waves in the electromagetic field.<br/>Secondly, similar light frequencies don&apos;t clash but blend together to<br/>produce an apparent intermediate frequency. Our computer monitors and TV<br/>screens use only three frequencies to emulate the entire visual spectrum.<br/>Imagine if we had only three notes! Thirdly, light does not normally have<br/>harmonics . . . I could go on and on.</p></div><h3><a id=14909 href="#14909">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2000 6:48:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Buddhi Wilcox&quot; &lt;buddhi@p...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/14869">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/14869</a></p><p>&gt; It should be possible , therefore , to &apos;transpose&apos; , for example ,<br/>a J.S.Bach prelude up the required number of octaves so that it is<br/>perceived visually as an intricate and harmonically balanced &apos;light-<br/>show&apos; .
