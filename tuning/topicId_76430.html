But, since I don&apos;t know either of you personally, it&apos;s<br/>possible I&apos;m overreacting and viewing the argument as hotter than the<br/>two of you view it.</p><p>Secondly, and I&apos;ll put this as clearly as I can because I haven&apos;t seen<br/>an indication from you that my previous comments to this effect have<br/>been understood, as a moderator, I don&apos;t want to be involved in<br/>censoring the discussion and I don&apos;t think the list, with the possible<br/>exception of Carl, wants us involved in censoring discussion. But IF<br/>the list desires the moderators to become involved, and that is a very<br/>big if, I would consider a thread where the personal attacks are<br/>underway a bigger threat to list peace than a thread where the<br/>discussion is still civil and act accordingly.</p><p>I understand your passion and only ask that you disagree without being<br/>disagreeable.</p><p>David Bowen</p></div>
