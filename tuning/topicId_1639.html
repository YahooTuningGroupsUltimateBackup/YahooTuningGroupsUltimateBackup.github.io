Their string<br/>instrument - the qanun - can modulate along the lines David Beardsley is<br/>suggesting.</p><p>A number of years ago I had the opportunity to play Oum Kalsoum &quot;fakebooks&quot;<br/>(not much different than the jazz chart collections) in a Lebanese restaurant<br/>in the Arab area of Brooklyn, on Atlantic Avenue.  There were no patrons,<br/>until much later.</p><p>The book had 2 accidentals: one for quarter sharp and one for quarter flat.<br/>They had key signatures.  Since I could sight read in straight 24ET<br/>quartertones, I just read through them.  Several were familiar.  Oum Kalsoum<br/>was the greatest musical artist that Egypt has produced by popular and<br/>critical acclaim.  I listen to her music every so often for sheer enjoyment.</p><p>There was a woman named Abdel Haq that made a microtonal piano for the Arabic<br/>world.  There was an expose on her instrument in an Irish Magazine which I<br/>have.  Dr. Haq lived in NYC for a year and explained her theory to me.</p><p>The piano - which never took off financially...Saudi Arabi didn&apos;t come<br/>through, could change to accommadate subtle pitch differences.  Iraq was the<br/>extreme with Syria somewhere between Iraq and Egypt (which she felt was equal<br/>spaced quartertones).</p><p>Egypt has historically been credited by the Greeks for having originated<br/>modulation.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br/><a href="mailto:afmmjr@aol.com">afmmjr@aol.com</a></p></div>
