Kaleidophon is a kind of functional canon.  Not an exact canon,<br/>&gt;because the note durations are taken at discrete points of a continuous<br/>&gt;function (a sine function, in fact).  This &quot;sampling&quot; of the function<br/>&gt;(at whatever time a new note is needed) leads to rhythmic values in each<br/>&gt;voice that are not exactly canonic even though the phase-shifted functions<br/>&gt;*are* strictly canonic.  Or something like that ....</p><p>Hmmm.  I&apos;m not sure I follow.  Isn&apos;t this the cannon with each part<br/>starting at a different place in the theme?  Isn&apos;t this the one where I<br/>pointed out the &quot;diagonal of 1/1&apos;s&quot; in the graphic representation?  Or was<br/>that a hasty analogy?</p><p>&gt;I suppose the piece is a kind of &quot;algo-comp&quot; though I don&apos;t think of it<br/>&gt;that way.  More like process music, where the piece is completely<br/>&gt;determined and constrained by the process.  early Reich, Lucier, etc...</p><p>Well, it might not fit well into the genre called &quot;algo-comp&quot;, but I sort<br/>of use the words process and algorithm interchangably here.</p><p>Carl</p></div>
