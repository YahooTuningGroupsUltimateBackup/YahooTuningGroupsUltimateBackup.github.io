Thought I would post<br/>it here, even though it&apos;s kind of borderline with respect to being<br/>mathematical, I think it has more of an atonal theory core to it:</p><p>&gt; In 12-Et there are 35 pentachord/septachords, after reducing for<br/>&gt; direction (reversibility of necklaces) and Z-relation (There are<br/>three Z-related pentachord/septachords (Three pairs of pentachords<br/>where each pair shares a common interval vector). The Z-related<br/>pentachords are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (0,1,2,5,9)---Z---(0,1,3,4,8)<br/>&gt; (0,1,2,5,8)---Z---(0,1,4,5,7)<br/>&gt; (0,1,3,5,6)---Z---(0,1,2,4,7)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first two are also related by &quot;M5&quot; symmetry: D4XS3 Group<br/>symmetry.<br/>&gt; The last one is an &quot;impassible&quot; weakly-related 7/5 set complex: The<br/>only<br/>&gt; way to go from the septachord to the pentachord is through a Z-<br/>related<br/>&gt; hexachord (All the Z-related hexachords are complements of each<br/>other)<br/>&gt; (0,1,3,5,6) is also special as a WR7/5SC in that the pentachord<br/>does not<br/>&gt; fit into the complementary septachord. The other two WR7/5SC<br/>complexes<br/>&gt; are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (0,1,4,7,8) and<br/>&gt; (0,1,2,4,7)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now there are also 35 hexachords, after reducing for direction and<br/>Z-<br/>&gt; relation (or just complementarity, since all the Z-related pairs<br/>are<br/>&gt; complements: there are 15). But let&apos;s stick to pentachords for now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My thinking is there is some numerical relationship between the 35<br/>&gt; pentachord/septachord types (and also 35 hexachord types) and<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; considerations: The diatonic MOS scale (white keys), the pentatonic<br/>MOS<br/>&gt; scale (black keys) number 7 and 5. There are 7 half steps in a P5<br/>and 5<br/>&gt; half steps in a P4. 36/35 is an important comma. And so forth.<br/>There is<br/>&gt; a fairly complicated formula for deriving the 35 hexachord types,<br/>(And<br/>&gt; 38 pentachords, short of the Z-relations) There is no real formula<br/>for<br/>&gt; calculating which sets are Z-related. Of course there is a formula<br/>for<br/>&gt; measuring primitive sets (using the moebius function). Of course<br/>with<br/>&gt; pentachords all of the sets are primitive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t have the formulas with me, but for pentachords it boils<br/>down to<br/>&gt; taking the 66 pentachords (full count, with inverses) and averaging<br/>with<br/>&gt; the symmetric ones (10) and gettin 38. With hexachords, there are<br/>80 to<br/>&gt; start with, reducing for complementability: 80+8/2 (8 is the number<br/>&gt; which map perfectly into their complement) This gives us 44,<br/>averaging<br/>&gt; with 26 (core of symmetry of complements, these are sets which are<br/>&gt; either symmetrical (13) or where the complement is also the inverse<br/>&gt; (13)) brings the count down to 35. So I ended up talking about<br/>&gt; hexachords anyway. The formulas for calculating these are based on<br/>&gt; Polya&apos;s counting method. (A different one from the one hitherfore<br/>&gt; presented on this newsgroup -- I&apos;ll post a new message tomorrow.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thoughts anyone, of how reversible complementable necklaces (which<br/>use<br/>&gt; group theory) could tie into tuning theory? Or even further, how<br/>&gt; interval vector counts (which one obtains after reducing for non-<br/>&gt; complementable and complementable Z-relations) could tie into<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; considerations?</p><p>Some added thoughts: Add 8 to (0,1,3,5,6) (That &quot;strangely-Z-related<br/>impassible weakly-related seven-five set complex&quot;) and you obtain<br/>(0,1,3,5,6,8). It&apos;s composed of V7 (on 8)and I (on 1) superimposed.<br/>It&apos;s complement is the blues scale! (0,1,2,5,7,10). If you take the<br/>complement of (0,1,3,5,6) you obtain a more symmetrical form of the<br/>blues scale (0,3,4,5,6,7,10) which is the blues scale with added<br/>major third (which is often in the harmony of blues: C-(E)-G-Bb)</p><p>Now the complement of (0,1,2,4,7), the Z-relation of (0,1,2,3,5,6) is<br/>nothing special. But its kind of interesting that (0,1,3,5,6) in 7-<br/>limit just intonation is (15,16,18,20,21) The ratio of 18/15 and<br/>21/18 is (6/5)/(7/6) is 36/35 -- could this have anything to do with<br/>the 35 pentachord/septachord types? Probably not... Remember there<br/>are also 35 hexachords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Hj</p></div>
