Beyond 256 you get some intervals that the formula says are bad but some of these are within 6.776 cents (256/255) of a *good* interval and by virtue of this are in themselves also good.</p><p>Testing the above formula it was consistent with sine wave tones but not consistent with complex tones. Intervals that should have been stronger sounded weaker and vice versa. So I wrote a program using the formula above that paired the first 32 partials (harmonics) of each note in an interval with the first 1024 partials of both notes avoiding doing any pairing twice. Why not pair *all* 1024 partials of both notes? I&apos;m not sure but it doesn&apos;t work. Perhaps it&apos;s because as you progress along the harmonic series the 1/x + 1/y part of the formula approaches zero (e.g. 1/256 + 1/512 = 0.0059) but the dissonance value does not diminish significantly (e.g. 256/512 = 0.5).</p><p>Right or wrong, the program I wrote (called IntCalc7) seems consistent when testing harmony intervals whose notes have a regular harmonic series/timbre (i.e. the frequencies of the partials are approximately x, 2x, 3x, 4x etc and the amplitudes of the partials are approximately y, y/2, y/3, y/4 etc).</p><p>What about melody? The formula I worked out was 2/x + 2/y. Why not<br/>1/x + 1/y? This is purely cosmetic: using 2/x + 2/y any melodic interval with a value of 1.0 or higher sounds like a Major progression and any melodic interval with a value less than 1.0 sounds like a Minor progression.</p><p>I had a suspicion that the 2/x + 2/y formula might be good for complex tones as well as sine wave tones and indeed it is. I wrote two programs that used the 2/x + 2/y formula. The first program paired the first 32 partials of each note with the other 1024 partials and the second paired *all* of the first 1024 partials of both notes. The results were different in magnitude but in all three cases the proportions were pretty much exactly the same. In other words the 2/x + 2/y formula for melody is equally good for both sine wave tones *and* complex tones with a &grave;regular&apos; timbre.</p><p>For me this is relevant to scale construction. Say you want a scale exactly one octave wide. The tonic is 1/1 and the octave is 2/1. Now you select a few notes (I stick with eleven but you can choose any number) in between 1/1 and 2/1 so as to build a scale. It seems to me that (if 1/1 is the tonic), every note in the scale should &quot;go&quot; with 1/1 according to a *good* melodic interval within 6.776 cents (256/255) accuracy. What are the good notes that *go* with 1/1?

I know some will argue that if you don&apos;t play a pair of notes that are less than 48.18855 cents apart consecutively then you can &quot;get away with it&quot; but I disagree.</p><p>End of Part I.

Beyond 256 you get some intervals that the formula says are bad but some of these are within 6.776 cents (256/255) of a *good* interval and by virtue of this are in themselves also good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Testing the above formula it was consistent with sine wave tones but not consistent with complex tones. Intervals that should have been stronger sounded weaker and vice versa. So I wrote a program using the formula above that paired the first 32 partials (harmonics) of each note in an interval with the first 1024 partials of both notes avoiding doing any pairing twice. Why not pair *all* 1024 partials of both notes? I&apos;m not sure but it doesn&apos;t work. Perhaps it&apos;s because as you progress along the harmonic series the 1/x + 1/y part of the formula approaches zero (e.g. 1/256 + 1/512 = 0.0059) but the dissonance value does not diminish significantly (e.g. 256/512 = 0.5).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right or wrong, the program I wrote (called IntCalc7) seems consistent when testing harmony intervals whose notes have a regular harmonic series/timbre (i.e. the frequencies of the partials are approximately x, 2x, 3x, 4x etc and the amplitudes of the partials are approximately y, y/2, y/3, y/4 etc).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about melody? The formula I worked out was 2/x + 2/y. Why not<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/x + 1/y? This is purely cosmetic: using 2/x + 2/y any melodic interval with a value of 1.0 or higher sounds like a Major progression and any melodic interval with a value less than 1.0 sounds like a Minor progression.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I had a suspicion that the 2/x + 2/y formula might be good for complex tones as well as sine wave tones and indeed it is. I wrote two programs that used the 2/x + 2/y formula. The first program paired the first 32 partials of each note with the other 1024 partials and the second paired *all* of the first 1024 partials of both notes. The results were different in magnitude but in all three cases the proportions were pretty much exactly the same. In other words the 2/x + 2/y formula for melody is equally good for both sine wave tones *and* complex tones with a &grave;regular&apos; timbre.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For me this is relevant to scale construction. Say you want a scale exactly one octave wide. The tonic is 1/1 and the octave is 2/1. Now you select a few notes (I stick with eleven but you can choose any number) in between 1/1 and 2/1 so as to build a scale. It seems to me that (if 1/1 is the tonic), every note in the scale should &quot;go&quot; with 1/1 according to a *good* melodic interval within 6.776 cents (256/255) accuracy. What are the good notes that *go* with 1/1? Here they are in order of strength (use fixed width font)...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interval, Strength, Width<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  1/1   4.000      0.0000c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  2/1   3.000   1200.0000c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  3/2   1.6667   701.9550c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  4/3   1.1667   498.0450c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  5/3   1.0667   884.3587<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  5/4   0.9000   386.3137<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  7/4   0.7857   968.8259<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  6/5   0.7333   315.6413<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  7/5   0.6857   582.5122<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  8/5   0.6500   813.6863<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  9/5   0.6222  1017.5963<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  7/6   0.6190   266.8709<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  8/7   0.5357   231.1741<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11/6   0.5152  1049.3629<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  9/7   0.5079   435.0841<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 10/7   0.4857   617.4878<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  9/8   0.4722   203.9100<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11/7   0.4675   782.4920<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 12/7   0.4524   933.1291<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 13/7   0.4396  1071.7018<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11/8   0.4318   551.3179<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 10/9   0.4222   182.4037<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11/9   0.4040   347.4079<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 13/8   0.4038   840.5277<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 15/8   0.3833  1088.2687<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11/10  0.3818   165.0042<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 13/9   0.3761   636.6177<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 14/9   0.3651   764.9159<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 13/10  0.3538   454.2140<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 12/11  0.3485   150.6371<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 16/9   0.3472   996.0900<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17/9   0.3399  1101.0454<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 13/11  0.3357   289.2097<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 14/11  0.3247   417.5080<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 13/12  0.3205   138.5727<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17/10  0.3176   918.6417<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 15/11  0.3152   536.9508<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 16/11  0.3068   648.6821<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 19/10  0.3053  1111.1993<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17/11  0.2995   753.6375<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 14/13  0.2967   128.2982<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 18/11  0.2929   852.5921<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 15/13  0.2872   247.7411<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 19/11  0.2871   946.1951<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17/12  0.2843   603.0004<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 20/11  0.2818  1034.9958<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 16/13  0.2788   359.4723<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 21/11  0.2771  1119.4630<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 15/14  0.2762   119.4428<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 19/12  0.2719   795.5580<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17/13  0.2715   464.4278<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 18/13  0.2650   563.3823<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17/14  0.2605   336.1295<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 19/13  0.2591   656.9854<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 16/15  0.2583   111.7313<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 20/13  0.2538   745.7861<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 23/12  0.2536  1126.3193<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17/15  0.2510   216.6867<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 17/16  0.2426  104.9554<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyone want to test these melodic intervals against their values?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I propose 5 categories of Melodic intervals...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (i) Value 1.0 or higher is Major (sweet).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (ii) Value between 0.5 and 0.9999 is a Blue Minor (sweet).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (iii) Value between 0.25 and 0.4999 is an Ultra Minor (sweet).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (iv) Value between 0.125 and 0.2499 is &quot;tolerable&quot; but not sweet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (v) Value less than 0.125 is &quot;intolerable&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So if all the notes in a scale are within 6.776 cents (256/255) of any of the notes listed above (except the last note,17/16) then the scale is &quot;tonally good&quot;. If a note occurs that isn&apos;t within 6.776 cents of any of the notes listed above then the scale is &quot;tonally bad&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The last note in the list above, 17/16 has a value less than 0.25 but it is within 6.776 cents accuracy of 16/15. In fact it is right on the cusp. The distance between 16/15 and 17/16 is exactly my old friend 6.775877 cents (256/255). Interesting coincidence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have one more stipulation for a good scale. Most &quot;tonally good&quot; scales will contain other melodic intervals (that don&apos;t contain the tonic, 1/1) that are not &quot;sweet (i) to (iii)&quot; but are &quot;tolerable (iv)&quot; and/or &quot;intolerable (v)&quot;. As long as all the notes that go with the tonic are &quot;sweet&quot; it doesn&apos;t seem to matter much if a few other intervals in the scale that don&apos;t contain the tonic, 1/1, are only &quot;tolerable&quot;. The narrowest &quot;true&quot; interval that is &quot;tolerable&quot; is 32/31 with a value of 0.127 (just above the cutoff point of 0.125). Any interval within 6.776 cents of 32/31 should be tolerable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 32/31 is 54.964428 cents. Going down by 6.775877 cents we get 48.18855 cents. So any interval narrower than 48.18855 cents is &quot;intolerable&quot;. So a scale that contains an interval narrower than 48.18855 cents is &quot;intolerable&quot;. I know some will argue that if you don&apos;t play a pair of notes that are less than 48.18855 cents apart consecutively then you can &quot;get away with it&quot; but I disagree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; End of Part I.

Next pair the second note (15/14) with the other 12 notes and add the 12 results. Next pair the third note (9/8) with the other 12, and so on. The ratios should be simplified (e.g. 16/12 simplifies to 4/3) before calculation. The formula above is good only for &quot;just&quot; intervals where x and y are less than 256.</p><p>The note with the highest value is the tonic (in this case 1/1).</p><p>So here 1/1 is stronger than 2/1. This is good for melodies or chord progressions that go up from 1/1 and back down to 1/1 again, but not so good for melodies/progressions that go down from 2/1 and back up to 2/1 again. Most music &grave;lands&apos; on 1/1 but there are exceptions. E.g. Sweet Jane by The Velvet Underground starts on a high E (the tonic), goes down to B, down to A, up to Db Minor, down to B and finally up to the high E again. Here the tonic is (relatively) 2/1 and not 1/1.</p><p>So it would seem that Blue Just is better for &quot;up/down&quot; music but not so good for &quot;down/up&quot; music.</p><p>One way to have 1/1 and 2/1 as tonics of equal strength is to build a symmetric scale. Here&apos;s a likely candidate (Michael S. correctly suggested that 10/9 and 9/5 should be better than 9/8 and 16/9)...</p><p>1/1, 16/15, 10/9, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, sqrt(2), 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 9/5, 15/8, 2/1.</p><p>The notes going up from 1/1 are the exact mirror image of the notes going down from 2/1. So both 1/1 and 2/1 are equally good as tonics. Note that a sqrt(2) interval does not work in harmony (chords) but it is acceptable in melody. It is only 3 cents away from 17/12 which for me is a &grave;sweet&apos; (but minor) melodic interval (see msg 96503). Using the 2/x + 2/y formula, 2/17 + 2/12 = 0.2843. Any melodic interval with a value higher than 0.25 should be good.</p><p>I tempered the symmetric scale above (I call it the Mirror Scale) so as to yield as many good harmony intervals as possible while maintaining the symmetry and the resulting scale has only 83 good harmony intervals an octave or less wide. Blue Temperament has 97 good harmony intervals. Here are the good (according to my taste) harmony intervals...</p><p>9/8, 8/7, 7/6, 6/5, 5/4, 9/7, 4/3, 11/8, 7/5, 10/7, 3/2, 11/7, 8/5, 5/3, 12/7, 7/4, 9/5, 11/6, 13/7, 2/1.</p><p>I found symmetry another way. By chance I stumbled upon a scale where the notes going up from 1/1 were the exact mirror image of the notes going down from 3/2. Blue Just has this property. Here it is again...</p><p>1/1, 15/14, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 9/5, 15/8, 2/1.</p><p>Like I said, the notes going up from 1/1 are the exact mirror image of the notes going down from 3/2. So we have two usable tonics of equal strength, 1/1 and 3/2. 1/1 is better for &quot;up/down&quot; music and 3/2 is better for &quot;down/up&quot; music (see above). We now have the best of both worlds.</p><p>Blue Just has exactly 72 &quot;good&quot; harmony intervals an octave or less wide (including the octave and excluding the unison) over twelve keys. That&apos;s 72 out of a possible 144 (12 x 12) intervals, a &quot;hit rate&quot; of exactly 50%. These are all perfectly in tune. There&apos;s also a 13/7 interval lurking in there somewhere, not perfectly in tune but within 6.776 cents accuracy.</p><p>My chosen method for building scales is to find the best possible &quot;just&quot; scale (which should be &quot;tonally good&quot;, see msg 96503) and then temper each note by not more than 6.776 cents (256/255) to squeeze as many good harmony intervals (an octave or less wide) out of it as possible. It may not be the best approach but there&apos;s nothing wrong with it and it&apos;s viable.</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure that Blue Just is the most versatile &quot;symmetric&quot; (two tonics of equal strength, in this case 1/1 and 3/2), 12 keys per octave, just scale. I tempered this scale (preserving the symmetry) to get Blue Temperament. Here it is...</p><p>0.0<br/>121.6<br/>200.7<br/>313.5<br/>388.4<br/>501.2<br/>580.4<br/>702.0<br/>816.9<br/>889.4<br/>1012.5<br/>1085.1<br/>1200.0</p><p>Blue Temperament has 97 good harmony intervals (within 6.776 cents accuracy) out of a possible 144, a &quot;hit rate&quot; of just over 67%.</p><p>Can anyone beat this? Mike sent me a few scales and the most versatile (Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone) has only 94 good harmony intervals.</p><p>My tempering algorithm does not use chains or circles of intervals. The program works out every possible combination of frequencies and analyses each combination. Each frequency starts with &quot;original just freq - 6.776 cents&quot; and ends with &quot;original just freq + 6.776 cents&quot; with a step size of 0.28233 cents. Because of the symmetry (pairs of notes and not single notes are tempered equally) I only need 5 nested &quot;for loops&quot; (the program takes over five hours to run) and not 11 nested &quot;for loops&quot; (which would take years to run).</p><p>You can hear five compositions by Chris Vaisvil that use both Blue Just and Blue Temperament on my web site...</p><p><a href="http://www.johnsmusic7.com">http://www.johnsmusic7.com</a></p><p>John.</p></div><h3><a id=96585 href="#96585">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Nielsen &#x3C;nielsed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2011 12:32:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m enjoying these posts, John.

Would it be sensible to interpolate these functions?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=96612 href="#96612">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Nielsen &#x3C;nielsed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2011 10:43:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This is a different formula than the one you originally stated.
