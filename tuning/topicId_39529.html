That&apos;s partially because quartertones are so<br/>&gt; established in the contemporary repertory.  That&apos;s one reason that<br/>&gt; music composition software manufacturers like *Sibelius* pretty much<br/>&gt; *have* to include quartertone options.  So we&apos;re at 50 cents, there...</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2002 9:37:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/39529">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/39529</a></p><p>&gt; Sib can do more than this, but very badly.

I can get you in touch<br/>with him if you&apos;re interested in it.  It, basically, transforms<br/>the &quot;usual&quot; accidentals of Sibelius into whatever you want through<br/>pitch bends but, of course, it&apos;s *also* after you&apos;ve run the plug-<br/>in!  :)</p><p>&gt; World&apos;s best music program - not!</p><p>***Dunno.  My friend Bill Holab, who is one of the master ingravers<br/>in New York, feels it&apos;s the best to come along so far... that is the<br/>best program that does *notation* as well as writing.  Of course,<br/>there are certain things that can be done in sequencers that it can&apos;t<br/>presently do.</p><p>However, it&apos;s my feeling that Sibelius is still new and is very much<br/>a work in progress, and I think there&apos;s going to be much development<br/>on that front.  Admittedly, they are presently thinking more of *plug-<br/>ins* for &quot;accessory&quot; targeted applications at the moment...</p><p>But i still use it.

It can&apos;t<br/>even notate Beethoven and classical stuff correctly.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***What is &quot;Sib Soft&quot;... is that what you&apos;re calling the company?  I<br/>would have to disagree with you there, since I&apos;ve found them<br/>extraordinarily responsive, even if they haven&apos;t incorporated many of<br/>my microtonal suggestions as yet!</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s just so hooked up into midi<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;musically idiotic duodecimal indoctrination&quot; (can anyone improve<br/>on this?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for playback rather than being intelligent or easy to use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - sibelius winge over -<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Well, MIDI is a very important aspect.  I&apos;m coming from the SCORE<br/>tradition, which did a better job on the overall of *calligraphy* but<br/>didn&apos;t do MIDI hardly at all.  I&apos;d certainly rather have the MIDI<br/>application, though, since it turns it into an *entirely* different<br/>kind of composing tool, so I&apos;m afraid I&apos;d have to disagree with you a<br/>bit there...</p><p>By the way, Mark, would you mind if I were to post your ideas on the<br/>microtonal limitations of Sibelius to the Sibelius list??  (Or post<br/>them yourself if you are so inclined)</p><p>The only way we&apos;re going to get the company to do anything is if they<br/>hear from users about these things.  I won&apos;t include any of the<br/>really negative commentary about the company, but I *would* like to<br/>include your comments about the microtonal limitations.</p><p>Is that OK??</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
