In 13-tET, you can&apos;t<br/>get 26-tET&apos;s approximations of the 3rd harmonic or the 7th harmonic, but you<br/>can get a full 4:5:9:11:13 chord, as well as (obviously) subsets and<br/>subharmonic versions. The intervals in this chord are approximated about as<br/>well as the intervals in 4:5:6 are approximated by 12-tET.</p><p>The 4:5:9:11:13 chord is 0 4 15 19 22 in 13-tET. Try it!</p></div>
