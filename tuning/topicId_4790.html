He cites a study by Strucker, Zsch. Sinnesphysiol., XLII,&lt;br&gt;&gt;1908,<br/>where the pitch discrimination of 16 professional musicians in<br/>the&lt;br&gt;Royal&lt;br&gt;&gt;Opera in Vienna was measured (at 435 Hz).  Four of the<br/>subjects discriminated&lt;br&gt;&gt;less than one cent, and five others within two<br/>cents (one cent at 435 Hz is&lt;br&gt;&gt;very nearly 0.25 Hz).  Figure 1, page 60,<br/>also shows that pitch&lt;br&gt;discrimination&lt;br&gt;&gt;is actually about twice as fine at<br/>2000 Hz as for 435 Hz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fred, do you know if this was done with pure<br/>tones, or...?</p><p>Seashore&apos;s discussion of measurement of pitch discrimination, just preceding<br/>his citation of the Stucker experiment, is clearly restricted to pure tones -<br/>either tuning fork/resonator devices or electr[on]ic oscillators.  So, I would<br/>infer that the Stucker measurements were made with pure tones.</p><p>Fred</p><p>____________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a href="http://webmail.netscape.com">http://webmail.netscape.com</a>.</p></div>
