Jazz Choir. I recommend that you read his<br/>book, which although not technically advanced, clearly explains how music<br/>actually works. His idea about flexible intonation is fundamental to the<br/>theory that I&apos;ve been proposing. His examples of his experience working<br/>with his singers, and his descriptions of how they listen for intonation<br/>(&quot;singing into the chords until the individual pitches disappear&quot;) are<br/>illuminating.</p><p>Gerald Eskelin&apos;s website is as follows:</p><p>        <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/">http://home.earthlink.net/~stg3music/</a></p><p>John Link<br/>ALMOST ACAPPELLA</p></div>
