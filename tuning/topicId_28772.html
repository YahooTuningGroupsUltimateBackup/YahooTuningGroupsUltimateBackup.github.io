Many of these are certainly in a &quot;higher&quot;<br/> class of complexity compared to lots of familiar rhythms in the West.<br/>However, what we look at as 11/8, they may be internally thinking<br/>of as &quot;short short short long short&quot; (2 2 2 3 2) hence it is really<br/>a sequence of 5 familiar things. You can see other more complex<br/>rhythms which will be similarly heirarchical, like (artificial<br/>example follows, but its kinda hip!)</p><p>                           24/8<br/>                        7 + 8 + 9<br/>              (2+2+3) + (3+3+2) + (2+2+2+3)</p><p>This does get back to some form of Miller 7+-2 stuff.</p><p>(If we look at Afro-Cuban and other West African descended musics,<br/>we have some &quot;simple&quot; fundamentals in the &quot;marriage of 3 and 2&quot; and<br/>the clave pattern etc...)</p><p>I believe something like this holds in a melody sense too. I don&apos;t<br/>think I could ever grasp a &quot;white key&quot; scale of more than about 9<br/>notes, however, that doesn&apos;t mean that it can&apos;t freely modulate or<br/>borrow neighbors from some infinite pallette, as long as I can deal<br/>with some part of the heirarchy at that sort of level.</p><p>Related thoughts to this :</p><p>   I like Babbitts music because of the repeated notes. He allows<br/>   his very complicated melodic material slip into these little<br/>   &quot;micro-motifs&quot;, and suddenly, there is something comprehendable.<br/>   If this didn&apos;t occur, it would  just sound like random notes<br/>   at random volumes to me (at which point it is likely that real<br/>   world noises will be more interesting since they often have<br/>   timbral activity that we try to eliminate from our musical<br/>   instruments).</p><p>   One way of dealing with non-octave scales is to build them up<br/>   heirarchically from smaller cells similar to tetrachordality,<br/>   just don&apos;t have them bump into a usable 2/1 (or hit it in the<br/>   middle of a pattern so its function is not quite a 2/1).</p><p>   Latest scale I&apos;m working with, (in 12, but I&apos;m trying some<br/>                                   other tunings...)</p><p>     logically  1 b2 #2 3 [4 #4 b5] 5 b6 #6 7<br/>                           ^^^^^^^: not quite sure whether I want<br/>                                    one or all of these to tie the<br/>                                    repeated thingies together...</p><p>     &quot;JI&quot; : 1/1 12/11 7/6 5/4 [ ] 3/2 18/11 7/4 15/8<br/>                               ^<br/>                   [4/3 11/8 7/5 10/7 16/11]</p><p>   Relating to the non-octave thing I mentioned,, 0one could<br/>   construct it in 31 as the cell</p><p>             3 4 3 4 4</p><p>   and it will produce this series, miss the octave, and keep<br/>   repeating the cell on the chain of fifths (1, 5, 2, 6, 3 etc...)<br/>   Of course this is a MOS, but in a non-octave world, the addition<br/>   of a sharp HERE also adds a sharp THERE, and its only on the<br/>   same cell degree, not related to the octave... I guess this gets<br/>   into how I would approach using the Peirce-Bohlen (sp, sp)...</p><p>   I&apos;m not sure THIS is entirely useful... I&apos;m more inclined to<br/>   keep it as an octave scale (again in 31) like...</p><p>             3 4 3 3 [5] 3 4 3 3<br/>                      ^<br/>      [2,3 and 3,2 equally available]</p><p>   But back to the 3 4 3 4 4, if we make it an octave scale it looks<br/>   like<br/>             3 4 3 4 4 3 4 3 3</p><p>   For MOSniks, this is two alterations from a 9 note MOS.</p><p>             s L s L L s L s s &lt;- the scale<br/>take out<br/>two          s L s L s L s L s &lt;- the MOS parent<br/>alterations</p><p>   ...and it has a symmetric rotation (which probably would<br/>   sound a bit harsh in 31...)</p><p>             L s L s s s L s L</p><p>The success will be when I can improvise in it at speed (with<br/>taste and feeling) over the 11/8 above, regardless of the tuning!</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
