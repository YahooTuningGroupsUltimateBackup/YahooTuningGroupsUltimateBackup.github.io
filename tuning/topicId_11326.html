Instead, bringing it any distance (in this case, halfway)<br/>&gt; &gt; towards 7:4 only improves its concordance.  Meanwhile, the two<br/>&gt; &gt; perfect fourths are only tempered by 1/4 of a septimal comma. As a<br/>&gt; &gt; result, this two-stacked-fourths chord (and for similar reasons,<br/>&gt; &gt; chords of three stacked fourths) sounds very pleasant in &quot;pure 9:7<br/>&gt; &gt; hypermeantone tuning&quot;, or the virtually identical 22-tET.</p><p>I was thinking of the cases where D-G-C is used as a D7sus4 (no 3rd) chord,<br/>i.e., D is clearly the root (say it&apos;s doubled an octave or two lower by the<br/>bass). Your theory may not allow this interpretation but believe me, as a<br/>musician I know it is real. In this case, bringing the seventh down toward<br/>7/4 is helpful both in terms of making the 16:9 more consonant, and in terms<br/>of chord function.</p></div><h3><a id=11333 href="#11333">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Essentially, the previous chord is 1/1:7/6:7/4. Then, holding these<br/>notes, the root moves down a &quot;fifth.&quot; The temperament is essential since it<br/>allows the 7/4 to function as a smooth suspended &quot;fourth&quot; over the new root,<br/>while remaining consonant with the 7/6 which is a smooth &quot;seventh&quot; over the<br/>new root.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I was thinking of the cases where D-G-C is used as a D7sus4 (no 3rd)<br/>chord,<br/>&gt;&gt; i.e., D is clearly the root (say it&apos;s doubled an octave or two lower by<br/>the<br/>&gt;&gt; bass). Your theory may not allow this interpretation but believe me, as a<br/>&gt;&gt; musician I know it is real.</p><p>&gt;&quot;D&quot;, you say? &quot;My&quot; theory (Partch would agree, I think) says that D is<br/>&gt;one of the two alternate roots (an incomplete Gm with added 4th,<br/>&gt;common overtone D). (Of course you do know this<br/>&gt;sort of calculus, only you do not apply it. BTW, I am still<br/>&gt;grateful for catching a silly mistake of mine once.)</p><p>By emphasizing the low bass note, I&apos;m clearly implying a normal, otonal<br/>root, rather than a high-pitched common overtone which would be the utonal<br/>&quot;root&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In this case, bringing the seventh down toward<br/>&gt;&gt; 7/4 is helpful both in terms of making the 16:9 more<br/>&gt;&gt; consonant, and in terms of chord function.</p><p>&gt;I repeat, it might be so in certain progressions but I remain<br/>&gt;to be convinced with an example. In the static case my ears simply do<br/>&gt;not perceive the advantage, not yet in any case.</p><p>I certainly don&apos;t disagree with you -- from the point of view of roughness,<br/>the fourths will probably suffer more from being mistuned by 1/4 septimal<br/>comma than the seventh gains by its mistuning being reduced from 1 septimal<br/>comma to 1/2 septimal comma. However, the chord gains a certain quality<br/>having to do with the seventh approaching a 7:4, thus strengthening the root<br/>feeling of the bass note, despite the apparent contradiction that the<br/>fourths, still heard as 4:3s, would mathematically imply a 16:9 seventh.</p><p>&gt;(The stack of<br/>&gt;three fourths is another story.)</p><p>Why?</p><p>I think in that case the consonance of using a 7:3 for the outer interval is<br/>a strong motivation to use this temperament.</p><p>&gt;I joined the list to look for<br/>&gt;suggestions on a certain subject but I got distracted by the<br/>&gt;argument on the ideal tuning of stacked fourths.</p><p>That not really what this exchange was about -- I think you took my remarks<br/>out of context. I did not say that 22-tET or a similar hypermeantone was<br/>&quot;the ideal tuning of stacked fourths.&quot; I was simply responding to Margo&apos;s<br/>note that for a 4:6:9, 6:8:9, 8:9:12, or 9:12:16 chord, the tempering would<br/>disturb the 9-limit interval twice as much as it disturbs the 3-limit<br/>intervals. My response was that, particularly in the case of the 9:12:16,<br/>the disturbance of the 9-limit interval could be more than offset by<br/>bringing it closer to a simpler 7-limit interval. However, the disturbance<br/>of the 3-limit intervals remains unmitigated.</p></div>
