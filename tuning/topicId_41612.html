From what I have read about on the history of scales seems to indicate that as time passed, more and more notes were added to the &quot;western&quot; traditional scale, but it stopped at 12. Is the reason for this due to the &quot;average&quot; human being able to &quot;deal&quot; with 12 notes in an octave? (Key word here is &quot;average&quot;, and I assume that most people on this list are NOT average when it comes to the number of &quot;notes&quot; they can decern within an octave).</p><p>My curiosity here might also have a relationship to the &quot;acceptance&quot; of serial techniques (in a limited way). In general, I do like the serial music of Messian and Stravinsky. They both used these techniques in different ways from how Schoenberg set down.</p><p>Stravinsky created tone rows that were of shorter length, and did not use all the notes of the chromatic scale. How does this &quot;limiting&quot; contribute to the (relative) success of these works? (I wish that I could remember the names of some of these works, but most all his later works are in this vain).</p><p>Messian seemed to have extended the idea of &quot;serialism&quot; to include an entire phrase. Look at the opening to &quot;Quartet for the end of time&quot;, he layers several unrelated phrases. This might be considered a &quot;strick&quot; serialism, but it could also be considered an early example of tape-loops...</p><p>How about a strick canon? Is that not a strick form of serialism? I don&apos;t think serialism per se, is new. JS Bach used it (in a sense) with his use of cantus firmus. I think the only rule that Schoenberg added was that no note may appear a second time until all others have been used (he was not the only one with that idea either). Other composers started to apply the &quot;serial&quot; techniques to other parameters, ad inifinitum/nauseum/absurdity...</p><p>I also wonder about how the relation between strick serial techniques and its &quot;polar&quot; opposite of &quot;aleatory&quot; or chance music (as in some of the piano works of Cage). These works seem to have many aural similarities.</p><p>Just a couple of sparks from my synaspes... for what its worth...</p><p>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=41628 href="#41628">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2002 11:42:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;(6) Is this any more or less artificial than serialism?

I didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; attend the talk, but noted that this sounded like nonsense<br/>&gt; to me.</p><p>While I don&apos;t think that 7 is a magical number as when measuring an absolute time, but a phrase of 7 different pitches (or with some repeated) seems to be well within the &quot;average&quot; persons ability to remember. How many pop songs (and I am not advocating pop music as any standard of excellance, but as a point of musical memory) do you remember simply because they have a memorable hook (or phrase) be it musical, rhythmic, or lyrical. These things are generally short and catchy.</p><p>A case in point in &quot;western&quot; classical music, look at each of the inventions by Bach, each presented a short (well some do) phrase of limited resources, which goes on to be subjected to several types of tranformations. I would venture to say that the ones that are based on shorter, smaller number of elements, are the more memorable one due to having fewer elements to deal with. I would imagine that Bach wrote these pieces knowing that they would be played by 2nd or 3rd year students, so they needed to have simple &quot;hooks&quot; that could be easily picked up.</p><p>I am in no way suggesting that to get music to be more &quot;acceptable&quot; that it needs to be dumbed down, but I do question the levels of complexity that some composers seem to strive for. While in concept, I agree with the &quot;Futurist Manifesto&quot;, I am not really thrilled with music produced using those philosophies... I agree that an &quot;artist&quot; should be free to explore their &quot;art&quot;, but how self-indulgent do we have to be.</p><p>&gt; Brian McLaren and Stephen Soderberg have both discussed the<br/>&gt; Miller limit in the past on this list, in dubious contexts<br/>&gt; as far as I was concerned.</p><p>While it does have some concerns, I don&apos;t know how easily it applies in all &quot;contexts&quot;. Just like the concept of &quot;Total Serialism&quot; reaches absurdity in practice, I would imagine that trying to apply this &quot;7-limit&quot; (and I don&apos;t mean the tuning 7-limit) to all factors of music would produce just as an absurd music as 12-tone or serial techniques.</p><p>While I do like some serial music, I do admit that I like it more for the effect that it produces while I am listening to it more than how memorable it is, or if I can whistle it the next day. I can remember some recordings of complex soundscapes in my head almost as if I were listening to them (or at least I seem to delude myself into thinking this), and I think this is because in my mind, I am hearing each of the complex groups as separate elements, which (may or may not) come down to a set of 7 elements. But trying to whistle a simple 12-tone tune (even one as simple as the chromatic scale) is difficult for some trained musicians.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Is the reason for this due to the &quot;average&quot; human being able<br/>&gt;&gt;to &quot;deal&quot; with 12 notes in an octave?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Miller suggests that the diatonic scale may have been limited<br/>&gt; to 7 notes because of the limitations of human working memory.<br/>&gt; 12 is too far beyond the limit for this kind of reasoning, and<br/>&gt; indeed, very few memorable tunes use 12 distinct tones (not<br/>&gt; including ornaments, commatic variations, etc.).</p><p>Well, now that I read down this far, it would appear that we are both saying the same things...</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Mike</p></div><h3><a id=41633 href="#41633">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>12/23/2002 2:25:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael McGonagle wrote:</p><p>&gt; I have wanted to track this article down myself (I have since deleted &gt; the refernce to the article), as I have wondered how something such as &gt; this &quot;Limit&quot; concept has played a part in how our scales have been &gt; created over the ages.

A 12 note scale is the simplest one in which you can describe a diatonic scale with large and small steps.  As such, it&apos;s been around a long time -- even the Greeks thought about equal semitones.  Equal tempering is the modern idea, but it looks like one reason 12 won out over 19 is that people were already thinking in terms of a 12 note gamut.</p><p>There are plenty of ways you can break the 12 note octave down into comprehensible chunks:</p><p>- Use subset scales (7 for major, 9 for minor)</p><p>- Think in terms of tetrachords (5 notes) or pentachords (7 notes)</p><p>- Use symmetrical tone rows (Webern did a lot of this)</p><p>                          Graham</p></div>
