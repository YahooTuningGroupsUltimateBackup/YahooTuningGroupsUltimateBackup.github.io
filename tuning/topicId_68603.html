A more severe test would come from, say, sawtooth<br/>waveforms...</p><p>I thought about playing it on my spinet, then worked out that the<br/>number of notes is too large to accommodate without temperament. So I<br/>tuned a meantone instead, pretty close to 31-EDO, with the aim of<br/>making 7:4 pure and 5:4 and 7:5 negligibly out-of-tune.</p><p>The drawback is that the minor thirds are about 6 cents out, and<br/>almost all the beating intervals you hear on the recording are minor<br/>thirds. The moment of greatest &apos;togetherness&apos; is the aug6 chord!<br/>I could probably do better since not all the minor 3rds involve notes<br/>which need to be tempered...</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning_files2/files/tomd/">launch.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning_files2/files/tomd/</a><br/>(may be some delay - my present connection is pretty slow and I&apos;m not<br/>sure if the file will get transferred properly)</p><p>How about the aug6 chord in the Parrott/Taverner recording? Sounds<br/>pretty close to a 4:5:7 to me.</p><p>In Excerpt 2 I changed my mind about the second chord (dim on<br/>Csharp)... owing to the voicing with E in the bass, I think it would<br/>be better with the following (relative to D=1)</p><p>E 10/9 G 4/3 Csharp 28/15</p><p>As for a Baroque recording with audible 7-limit chords, how about<br/>Michelangelo Rossi harpischord music on Naxos (played by Sergio<br/>Vartolo). Near the end of Toccata no.7 is an amazing chromatic<br/>passage which at a couple of points sets Eb against Csharp... and in<br/>the meantone tuning used, this results practically in a 7:4. However<br/>the passage is quite rapidly-moving so it is difficult to pick it out.</p><p>I think there is also a longer-held chord Eb-A-B at one point.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/2006 11:34:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Belated thanks to Monz for synthesizing the 7-limit Handel (and<br/>&gt; happy birthday to Monz Jr.!)</p><p>Is there a Monz Jr.?!</p><p>&gt;... however the sound quality my computer<br/>&gt; dresses it with is not ideal because<br/>&gt; 1) the &apos;voices&apos; have chronic vibrato, making it difficult to hear<br/>&gt; (mis)tuning, and<br/>&gt; 2) relatively little harmonic content.</p><p>I had similar concerns.  You may try what I didn&apos;t bother to<br/>do, which is load the midi file in a sequencer and change the<br/>patch to something like &quot;reed organ&quot; or whatever sounds best<br/>on your synth.</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning_files2/files/tomd/">launch.groups.yahoo.com/groups/tuning_files2/files/tomd/</a><br/>&gt; (may be some delay - my present connection is pretty slow and<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure if the file will get transferred properly)</p><p>I was able to get it just fine.  It sounds great!  And<br/>decidedly more &quot;septimal&quot; than any Messiah performance I&apos;ve<br/>heard (and I&apos;ve seen it live about a dozen times, sang it<br/>in choir myself, and I have 5 different recordings of it).</p><p>It&apos;s not that the performers aren&apos;t flirting with these<br/>ratios, it&apos;s just that they don&apos;t tend to hit them as accurately<br/>as they do ratios like 5:4 or 3:2.  And accurate hitting is<br/>even more important to bring out the locked sound of the<br/>septimal intervals.</p><p>&gt; How about the aug6 chord in the Parrott/Taverner recording? Sounds<br/>&gt; pretty close to a 4:5:7 to me.</p><p>There&apos;s a bit of chorusing going on.  Whatever it is, it isn&apos;t<br/>particularly clean.</p><p>&gt; As for a Baroque recording with audible 7-limit chords, how about<br/>&gt; Michelangelo Rossi harpischord music on Naxos (played by Sergio<br/>&gt; Vartolo). Near the end of Toccata no.7 is an amazing chromatic<br/>&gt; passage which at a couple of points sets Eb against Csharp... and<br/>&gt; in the meantone tuning used, this results practically in a 7:4.<br/>&gt; However the passage is quite rapidly-moving so it is difficult to<br/>&gt; pick it out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think there is also a longer-held chord Eb-A-B at one point.</p><p>I have this on a recording by Il Complesso Barocco under<br/>Alan Curtis.  Such things can be found in many keyboard works<br/>of the period.  But I believe, if you look back at the claim<br/>I made, it was in the context of non-keyboard music (because<br/>I am very well aware of these cases).</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/2006 1:05:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; As for a Baroque recording with audible 7-limit chords, how about<br/>&gt; Michelangelo Rossi harpischord music on Naxos (played by Sergio<br/>&gt; Vartolo).
