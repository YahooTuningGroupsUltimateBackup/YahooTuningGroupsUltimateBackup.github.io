Allow me to transfer some<br/>excerpts from the original analog sources and convert them to mp3,<br/>and I&apos;ll put some up on my <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a> page.</p><p>This is great that you&apos;ve got to see them live! I also love Zeena<br/>too! Anyone who will play a Harp through a fuzz box is ok in my book.</p><p>One interesting thing is that a friend of Frith and Cora was a guest<br/>improviser at my place during a recording session for my old free-<br/>form ensemble &quot;Silent Tongues&quot; (early 90s period). His name is Thomas<br/>Dimuzio. An extremely talented &quot;techie&quot; and guitarist, who actually<br/>did all of the sound design for a commercial sampling CD that Frith<br/>and Cora put out. Very nice chap.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
