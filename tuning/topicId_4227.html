I<br/>would therefore hope that our given area of interest -- tuning -- and all<br/>the related topics would be expressed in as precise a manner as possible.<br/>It is the imprecision that caused me to misinterpret Johnny&apos;s comment thusly:</p><p>[Johnny]<br/>&gt;Math is music.  Math is the true universal language.</p><p>[Jon]<br/>&gt;Therefore, music is also a universal language.</p><p>I must have taken the implication if (all) math is music then (all) music<br/>is math. My mistake (I&apos;m being generous); however, statements such as<br/>Johnny&apos;s, made with such broad generalities, will frequently be subject to<br/>misinterpretation. The tone of my post was to refute the idea that music is<br/>intrinsically or primarily a mathematical construct. So Johnny writes:</p><p>&gt;I am misrepresented in his charming anti-mathematical Sunday sermon.</p><p>It was _not_ in any way, shape, or form, *anti*-math. This was not unclear<br/>in my post; I referred to my afternoon being non-mathematical. Not anti-.</p><p>[Johnny]<br/>&gt;While not every parameter of music is fully grasped mathematically, digital<br/>&gt;recording is certainly more than a quantam leap past Pythagoras.</p><p>Digital recording has nothing to do with music, it only has to do with<br/>sound. While you can record music, you can also digitally record the sound<br/>of my taking a pee, and even Jesse Helm&apos;s will tell you that isn&apos;t music.<br/>The point of the statement is completely unclear.</p><p>&gt;IMHO, math in intrinsic to all music</p><p>That makes as much sense as saying math is intrinsic to all pieces of wood,<br/>since you can measure and weigh the wood. Math is certainly not intrinsic<br/>to *my* music, save for in the most incredibly banal ways, such as a time<br/>signature (if I choose to use one). I do not look at a painting and say<br/>&quot;Wow...math.&quot; I do not listen to my music, or for that matter, most music,<br/>and say &quot;Wow...math.&quot; While others may luxuriate in the patterns that spin<br/>out of a particular tuning schemata, tone row, or rhythmic periodicity, I<br/>don&apos;t.</p><p>But, for crying out loud, that does not make me anti-math.</p><p>Clarity.<br/>Clarity.<br/>Clarity.<br/>Music is not math.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>   Jonathan M.

True.  Clarity is not<br/>so easy with email.  I&apos;ve always tried to take the mystery out of music, to<br/>explain it even when it seems stubbornly ineffable.  It seems that as the<br/>mysteries are solved (usually through number juggling), the lessons drawn are<br/>filtered through the composer and me and the audience is mystified more than<br/>ever.</p><p>I suspect each of us has a different take on math and music, possibly due in<br/>large part to the nature of the interaction of the two in their respective<br/>artistic lives.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
