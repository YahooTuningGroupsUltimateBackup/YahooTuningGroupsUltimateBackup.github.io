One step of 402653184-edo is 2.98 * 10^(-6)<br/>cents; at 440 Hz that gives us a step from 440 to 440.00000075744,<br/>which has beats 15 days 6 hours and 44 minutes long.

For that matter, how would you handle new notes<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; being played while the pitchbend wheel is out of position?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; My suggestion: keep the current pitch bend as it is for the pitch wheel;<br/>&gt;&gt; It will always be a channel message and bend all notes on a channel.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is unacceptable and detrimental to microtonality. Each channel should<br/>&gt; be assigned an immense equal resolution out of which any subset should be<br/>&gt; extractable. Pitch-bend would then be merely a continuous reassignment of a<br/>&gt; particular note on that channel.</p><p>Depending on the instrument the pitch wheel can do different things. It&apos;s common for the pitch wheel to bend all notes on a channel, but for instance the Yamaha DX7II has a mode where only the notes that are held down are bent. It depends on whether you&apos;re trying to imitate a steel guitar or a koto. If you need more than one pitch bend at the same time in the same MIDI channel, you&apos;d need a message that&apos;s associated with a particular key, like polyphonic aftertouch.</p><p>Using the pitch wheel as a substitute for tuning tables is really just a hack for lack of a better method that works with most existing MIDI implementations, and interferes with the use of pitch wheel messages for expression. Changing the pitch bend message to specify a single note would just be a hack that works with even fewer MIDI implementations.</p><p>Adding a new status byte for an extended Note On (with tuning data) sounds like a good idea at first, but what would existing implementations do with it? They might just ignore the status byte and treat the following data bytes as new messages, interpreting them according to the current running status.

The multiple notes can come so<br/>fast that they don&apos;t even sound like the arpeggios that they<br/>actually are ...

The usual implementation is that it does, but an alternative<br/>implementation is that it doesn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   My next release of Fractal Tune Smithy (FTS 3.0) has an in-built waveform player -<br/>which specialises in playing repeating single waves - i.e. theoretical pure harmonic<br/>timbres. Anyway - I&apos;ve programmed it with an option to treat pitch bends in this<br/>polyphonic fashion and it works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   With this implementation of pitch bends, then you can have every one of those 128<br/>notes with a different pitch bend if you like, and you can do it without adding to the midi<br/>standard at all - just by choosing an alternative implementation of the pitch bend<br/>message.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   It has disadvantages. One disadvantage is that you can no longer use the pitch bend<br/>wheel to bend notes already in play.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Ideally one would want to combine the two - which seems to require two pitch bend<br/>messages - one to retune only the notes not yet played, and another to bend all the notes<br/>in the channel, including ones already in play as well as ones not yet played. The first one<br/>would be the one you send to retune a note to the current tuning and the second one<br/>would be the one you use to bend notes already in play - so that all notes in the channel<br/>are simultaneously bent and kept in tune with each other (e.g. to bend an entire chord at<br/>once).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   The two have to be cummulative - if you have already applied a pitch bend of -14<br/>cents to put the E in tune, then when the pitch bend wheel is in its rest position of - 0<br/>cents -  that should give you an E at 14 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   So - if you want to introduce a new message, you could have these two types of pitch<br/>bend message. This would require recoding because the synth would have to respond to<br/>both types of message - so would need to keep track of two types of pitch bend. But I<br/>think it may be about the smallest change you could make to midi that would work. You<br/>still have to figure out what bytes to use to send the alternative pitch bend message.<br/>Maybe add a new rpn? The rpns seem to be the easiest mechanism available in Midi to add<br/>new messages to it without the cumbersomeness of sysexes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Another disadvantage of these &quot;polyphonic pitch bends&quot; is that if you want to play lots<br/>of notes simultaneously that are very close in pitch - you may run out of notes near<br/>enough to be pitch bent to position within the standard + - two semitones pitch bend<br/>range. But you can manage a few notes all within a semitone of each other - and it isn&apos;t<br/>that often that one wants to simultaneously play a cluster of more than two or three notes<br/>so close together.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Another is that this &quot;polyphonic pitch bend&quot; still applies to all notes that follow from<br/>then on - if you do -14 cents, then E, then 0 cents then C then play an E  then the E is at 0<br/>cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   If you want to retune all your Es 14 cents flat, then you need to send a -14 cents pitch<br/>bend before every E that you play.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   So - to address those as well - you could have another new pitch bend message which<br/>applies to only a particular midi note, as suggested.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   That could be implemented using two rpns - one rpn varies the number to apply the<br/>bend to, and the other rpn sets the amount of the bend to use for the currently selected<br/>note to bend.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I&apos;m not particularly suggesting that this particular approach is the best way ahead. It is<br/>just an illustration, maybe it illustrates the sorts of issues one would need to address to<br/>implement this sort of change at a low level.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   The proposal to use ints would require more work by way of low level coding in<br/>practice, simple though it is in principle.. The midi file format is based on 7 bit integers<br/>and 8 bit bytes in a very low level way - and if you saved a midi file with ints, then there is<br/>no doubt at all it would be unplayable, and there is no way to make it playable by standard<br/>midi players as they would go through the file incrementing by 8 bits at a time, and if it<br/>was actually 16 bit ints, rather than 8 bit bytes in the file, then the file would be nonsense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Similarly also - in Windows anyway the way programs communicate midi messages to<br/>each other is also based on 8 bit bytes and the standard message structures of Midi in a<br/>very low level way. So in order to communicate integers via Midi Out or In, then you would<br/>need to get Microsoft to recode the Windows API for midi to accept integers, which would<br/>be a big task, and midi device drivers etc would also need to be recoded.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   You could have a midi file format involving ints that is only a file format used for<br/>sharing data between newly coded apps that are able to recognise it - but then the<br/>programs themselves need to be recoded to use ints when parsing the midi file. They<br/>would also need to be recoded to e.g. accept integer ranges for the variables. Also to re-<br/>parse the &quot;new style&quot; midi files using ints instead of bytes. I think maybe some very<br/>enthusiastic programmers might, or if their own internal format they use in their program<br/>is already for some reason very similar for some reason - happens to also use ints instead<br/>of bytes already (and particularly ints, and not floats or doubles say) - but the take up<br/>would be likely to be rather uneven.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Robert<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Robert walker &#x3C;robertwalker@robertinventor.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2007 7:32:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Ozan,</p><p>Yes it does take just a bit more time to send the messages.</p><p>The time to send the messages is already relevant for midi note ons - in a chord of five notes, then you have to send five midi messages to play the chord, so the last message is slightly delayed with respect to the first.</p><p>If the notes just have to be relayed internally from one program to another on the same computer - or over a high speed midi connection - then the extra time isn&apos;t that important.</p><p>Typically it may add a millisecond or so every five or ten messages or so (depending on the speed of the computer). At millisecond timing, then that&apos;s the sort of timing where if you view a piano from the player&apos;s point of view you hear the relative timing of the notes differently from a listener that hears the piano from the audience, because of the speed of sound as the soundwaves traverse the piano they take a millisecond or so to travel.  A chord in time to the nearest millisecond for the player (assuming the player could achieve such a thing) would no longer be in time at the millisecond level from the point of view of the audience because of the change in the geometry (the bass notes take slightly longer to reach the audience than treble notes on the millisecond level, while both take the same time to reach the player)..</p><p>(speed of sound = 340 m / second so in one millisecond sound travels about a foot).</p><p>I don&apos;t think ensembles normally manage to synchronise their notes to quite this level of accuracy - more like hundredths of a second, or maybe slightly better than that, but not quite thousandths of a second. It would be a great surprise if they could becaue they stand feet apart so sound takes milliseconds to get from one player to the other. E.g. if two players are one metre apart, the sound takes 3 ms. to get from the one to the other, so if the notes sound in time for the one player, they will sound 6 ms out of time to the other, just because of the speed of sound and the geometry of the situation.</p><p>If the notes have to go through a midi cable then the number of messages to be sent is more relevant as the protocol assumes a very slow rate of transmission of messages - in a very dense chord meant to be synchronous, if you have lots of midi messages it may get ragged just because of the time to transmit them through the cable.</p><p>With midi cables again, the size of an MTS sysex is relevant  though internally within a computer it isn&apos;t so releavant as a single sysex may well be transmitted internally in not much more than the same time it takes to send a single midi message.</p><p>Yes, you could have an enormous number of notes - or you could somewhat more easily conceptually have floating point numbers for the note number - so you can send e.g. 67.01955 as your midi note number to play - somewhat similar to what is done in CSound - same effect as having huge numbers of notes but probably easier to code for and for the user to understand too.</p><p>Conceptually that approach is much better. The problem is that that involves a fundamental change to the way that midi itself works, won&apos;t be backwards compatible, and will require a lot of recoding for someone. Would need recoding of all programs that parse midi files, and of all code used to transmit midi messages from one program to another - and change in the midi standards for sending data through a midi cable. Really you would prob. be better not calling it midi any more and just say it is a new standard with a close affinity to midi.</p><p>Again, hope this helps.</p><p>Robert</p><p>Re: [tuning] Re: Why don&apos;t we create our own damned midi standard?</p><p>Robert, your suggestion does not appeal to me for reasons you already stated as disadvantages.

I would like to see how you could program FTS to double pitch-bend notes on a single channel as you said. But is there no other solution that is backwards compatible?<br/>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Robert walker<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 04 Nisan 2007 &Ccedil;ar&scedil;amba 17:32<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Why don&apos;t we create our own damned midi standard?</p><p>  Hi Ozan,</p><p>  Yes it does take just a bit more time to send the messages.</p><p>  The time to send the messages is already relevant for midi note ons - in a chord of five notes, then you have to send five midi messages to play the chord, so the last message is slightly delayed with respect to the first.</p><p>  If the notes just have to be relayed internally from one program to another on the same computer - or over a high speed midi connection - then the extra time isn&apos;t that important.</p><p>  Typically it may add a millisecond or so every five or ten messages or so (depending on the speed of the computer). At millisecond timing, then that&apos;s the sort of timing where if you view a piano from the player&apos;s point of view you hear the relative timing of the notes differently from a listener that hears the piano from the audience, because of the speed of sound as the soundwaves traverse the piano they take a millisecond or so to travel.  A chord in time to the nearest millisecond for the player (assuming the player could achieve such a thing) would no longer be in time at the millisecond level from the point of view of the audience because of the change in the geometry (the bass notes take slightly longer to reach the audience than treble notes on the millisecond level, while both take the same time to reach the player)..</p><p>  (speed of sound = 340 m / second so in one millisecond sound travels about a foot).</p><p>  I don&apos;t think ensembles normally manage to synchronise their notes to quite this level of accuracy - more like hundredths of a second, or maybe slightly better than that, but not quite thousandths of a second. It would be a great surprise if they could becaue they stand feet apart so sound takes milliseconds to get from one player to the other. E.g. if two players are one metre apart, the sound takes 3 ms. to get from the one to the other, so if the notes sound in time for the one player, they will sound 6 ms out of time to the other, just because of the speed of sound and the geometry of the situation.</p><p>  If the notes have to go through a midi cable then the number of messages to be sent is more relevant as the protocol assumes a very slow rate of transmission of messages - in a very dense chord meant to be synchronous, if you have lots of midi messages it may get ragged just because of the time to transmit them through the cable.</p><p>  With midi cables again, the size of an MTS sysex is relevant  though internally within a computer it isn&apos;t so releavant as a single sysex may well be transmitted internally in not much more than the same time it takes to send a single midi message.</p><p>  Yes, you could have an enormous number of notes - or you could somewhat more easily conceptually have floating point numbers for the note number - so you can send e.g. 67.01955 as your midi note number to play - somewhat similar to what is done in CSound - same effect as having huge numbers of notes but probably easier to code for and for the user to understand too.</p><p>  Conceptually that approach is much better. The problem is that that involves a fundamental change to the way that midi itself works, won&apos;t be backwards compatible, and will require a lot of recoding for someone. Would need recoding of all programs that parse midi files, and of all code used to transmit midi messages from one program to another - and change in the midi standards for sending data through a midi cable. Really you would prob. be better not calling it midi any more and just say it is a new standard with a close affinity to midi.</p><p>  Again, hope this helps.</p><p>  Robert</p><p>  Re: [tuning] Re: Why don&apos;t we create our own damned midi standard?</p><p>  Robert, your suggestion does not appeal to me for reasons you already stated as disadvantages. Synchronous playing is sacrificed, or at least latency is introduced. Is it so impossible to implement a humonguous tuning table out of which any number of notes may be mapped to a Midi controller? I am thinking in line with Gene of an equal division of the entire compass so large as to be JI to all intents and purposes. As such, we can reserve pitch-bend its original function of simultaneously sliding chords in a channel. If we had, say a trillion or so equi-distant notes out of which any practical subset could be chosen and where portamenti and glissandi are indistinguishable from the real thing, then our problems would be over.</p><p>  Oz.</p></div><h3>Aaron Andrew Hunt &#x3C;aahunt@h-pi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2007 8:15:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham, MMA members are reps of companies.

Personally I&apos;d prefer that to ints in some very high number et, since you don&apos;t need a &quot;magic number&quot; to decode the file, so it is a bit more transparent, and also doubles at 64 bits are a little more accurate than ints.</p><p>It might also be better to change to a format that uses &quot;punctuation&quot; - or just a format where each status byte is followed immediately by an integer that tells the parser how many bytes to expect next - to allow for future changes if any more things need to be done to it. I expect that is how the midi file format would be done if it was set out now - rather than back then when every byte counted. Or indeed even a plain text format e.g. XML.</p><p>But even if it was just a new file format with ints or doubles all the way through - there would be issues for coders, many of them. You are asking for many hours of work to update the code. I could do it in FTS but it would take a fair amount of work just because it assumes byte size messages in the midi file parser, which then sends those messages on internally to the retuning midi player which also expects them to be byte sized - all that would need to be recoded and debugged with ints or (I would prefer) doubles. I might do it because of enthusiasm if there was a lot of demand for it and if I had the time. But do you expect Sibelius, Finale,  Microsoft etc to all follow suite? If they did, everyone would also have to update to a newer version of all those programs and of Windows too, and since they are all commercial companies, they would undoubtedly add on an extra cost to the customer to pay for all the extra coding that was required.</p><p>It is a fair amount of work - the equivalent for midi coding of the year 2000 bug fixes which was a very similar type of problem at the low level coding level. Depends - some programmers might find not much work is involved, while others might find that a lot of work is involved, so the uptake would be bound to be uneven, and depend on how easy it is to do and how enthusiastic the programmers were.</p><p>While on the other hand the extra rpns - though not ideal - do require very little extra coding all round, and also the sort of coding that is unlikely to lead to unrelated bugs - while changing bytes to ints or doubles is just the sort of thing that is fairly likely to introduce mysterious bugs and crashes in a program that need to be debugged - if coded all the way through to use bytes for that thing. Depending on how it is coded of course, so that is why I predict that it would be uneven in the uptake.</p><p>Robert</p><p>Re: Why don&apos;t we create our own damned midi standard?</p><p>Just use a conditional to parse the Note ON message.<br/>When it is found, either expect this or that; 2 more bytes,<br/>or 4 mour bytes, or whatever, and act accordingly.

But with RPNs, they should not be used for anything else. Yes if you add an extra RPN that _does_ mean a change in the midi spec, but a minimal one using a special mechanism already in place in the midi format to permit expansion.</p><p>The problem with the 5 byte midi note ons is the amount of recoding needed which would be expensive - and the lack of backward compatibility, so that you have to have two versions of your code to parse note ons, one version that parses them as 2 byte for backward compatibility - and one as 5 byte - and you need a mechanism by which a program can tell which way to parse the note message as well since one can&apos;t expect all programs, device drivers etc to simultaneously update to the new standard, and old hardware never can be updated, so a program must be able to handle both types of note on - and there has to be a message to tell a midi synth which one is currently in use for any particular device - and there must be an option in the user interface for the user to tell any particular midi program to send only the old two byte note ons to a particular synth if the user knows e.g. that it is a hardware synth or has not yet been coded for the newer 5 byte note ons of your proposal.</p><p>The amount of recoding you are talking about there is huge, many thousands or more of programmer years I would guess if all existing midi software were updated in this way.</p><p>While the rpns only affect the sending and receiving programs and nothing else in between, and is backwards compatible - as the receiving synth if it doesn&apos;t receive these extra rpns will just parse the midi stream as usual - it can include MTS sysexes, and standard pitch bends as well as the two new types of pitch bend message - and most programs won&apos;t use the new pitch bend messages to start with, but you just need one soft synth and one sending program that does use them and that is enough to start a user base. Then  if it is useful enough the new messages could then spread to other programs if enough users demand them to be introduced. So fully backwards compatible and it does introduce a couple of new RPNs - but there are plenty of those not yet taken up. Does need that to be approved in some way, don&apos;t know what the process is - or you could just introduce them experimentally in programs flagged clearly as beta software for users, and then use those programs as reasons to update the midi spec to permit them.</p><p>Not so elegant, but would work, is backward compatible, and you can continue to use standard pitch bends and MTS sysexes and this just adds another layer on top of them that has no effect if not present.</p><p>If you want to get something underway, and spread widely, something that requires a minimum of coding to include it is I think more likely to be widely accepted, not necessarily this idea, but some idea that requires similarly minimal recoding at the low level in midi, and preferably backwards compatible.</p><p>For something more elegant than midi while more data redundant, really one needs a new format altogether, midi comes from a time when single bytes were precious and transmission rates were slow, and formats used the minimum number of bytes - it is elegant in that sense of minimising the number of bytes, but not in the sense of transparency or permitting easy future expansion, and if that is ones objective one should really prob. start again and make a new up to date format for modern conditions - though it could be one with strong  affinities with midi.</p><p>If ones objective is to not change the midi spec at all, ones efforts might perhaps be best put towards trying for more widespread adoption of MTS.</p><p>The extra bytes are a nice idea at a high level, it is just that it doesn&apos;t work at a low level because of the particular way that midi was implemented at a low level. If it was more of a packet or tagged type format then the change would be trivial - but of course such formats use more bytes so would have been inappropriate to adopt at the time that the midi format was originally devised. Just a matter of particular historical circumstances which we can&apos;t do anything about and have to work with because of the widespread popularity of midi - well deserved I think because it is a fine format of its type, just that it has been so successful that it has lived on to times when the limitations in place when it was invented no longer apply.</p><p>Robert</p><p>..........<br/>Thanks Robert, for explaining your idea again here. If the spec<br/>isn&apos;t changing, then NRPS or non-registered parameter numbers<br/>would need to be used, since by definition RPNs mean something<br/>in the spec. It could be done, both in hardware and software, as<br/>you say. Since MIDI was created as a hardware interconnect protocol,<br/>in response to a lack thereof, for anything MIDI I tend to think<br/>about hardware first. A problem with this will be accessing the source<br/>for multiple notes in small intervals, especially if it is a sample,<br/>when the note number is the same but the tuning is different,<br/>such as an A + 4 cents and an A - 49 cents at the same time.<br/>In software you can work around it, but hardware?</p><p>Re: the problem you point out with the 5-byte message screwing up<br/>existing MIDI apps, APIs, etc. Yes, but this would not happen after the<br/>MIDI spec changes, because when the spec changes it will be<br/>supported. MMA members will not ignore a change to basic MIDI<br/>messages in the official spec. Microsoft and everyone else will have<br/>to update their drivers. That&apos;s how the rest of the techno-world functions;<br/>it&apos;s about time MIDI started working the same way.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2007 3:57:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; For something more elegant than midi while more data redundant,<br/>really one needs a new format altogether, midi comes from a time when<br/>single bytes were precious and transmission rates were slow, and<br/>formats used the minimum number of bytes - it is elegant in that sense<br/>of minimising the number of bytes, but not in the sense of transparency<br/>or permitting easy future expansion, and if that is ones objective one<br/>should really prob. start again and make a new up to date format for<br/>modern conditions - though it could be one with strong  affinities with<br/>midi.</p><p>How well would a Scsla seq file serve that purpose?

You could use your multi-channel keyboards to control 16 different voices of a microtonal synth by switching the cable number and you might even find a hardware box already set up to do this.

Also when you retune a midi file<br/>using pitch bends, the cents are stored as comments in the pitch bend<br/>track.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Why would<br/>&gt; &gt; you want to retrieve quantised raw tuning data from midi<br/>&gt; &gt; files?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because I&apos;d really like to be able to recover the<br/>&gt; tuning people (including but not confined to me)</p><p>Including yourself, so then use the solution I suggested and it will<br/>be much easier and you don&apos;t lose information. As for other people&apos;s<br/>files, there are often other ways to get this information, like asking<br/>them, etc. The remaining cases where there&apos;s no alternative are<br/>probably so rare, they don&apos;t warrant me to put a lot of effort in.</p><p>&gt; Oh, please. After all the times I&apos;ve looked at asciied<br/>&gt; midi binary, checked the pitch bend, coverted that to<br/>&gt; an interval, and tried to determine what scale was<br/>&gt; implied I think I am in a position to say it&apos;s a pain.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ve done this many times&quot; is not a convincing argument when there<br/>are alternatives.</p><p>&gt; Of course, maybe a utility exists somewhere to extract<br/>&gt; scale information from pitch bends, but if so, I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know of it.</p><p>No, anyone else cares to help Gene here?</p><p>&gt; So it should have no difficulty in recovering pitch info<br/>&gt; from the files it itself makes, it seems to me.</p><p>Nor should you have the problem of losing this info, it seems to me.</p><p>&gt;And why do we still get the track limitations with this system?</p><p>Which track limitations?</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>Aaron Andrew Hunt &#x3C;aahunt@h-pi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2007 2:17:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Robert; your idea is making more sense to me each time<br/>you explain it.

But with RPNs, they should not be used for<br/>anything else. Yes if you add an extra RPN that _does_ mean a change in the midi spec,<br/>but a minimal one using a special mechanism already in place in the midi format to permit<br/>expansion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The problem with the 5 byte midi note ons is the amount of recoding needed which<br/>would be expensive - and the lack of backward compatibility, so that you have to have two<br/>versions of your code to parse note ons, one version that parses them as 2 byte for<br/>backward compatibility - and one as 5 byte - and you need a mechanism by which a<br/>program can tell which way to parse the note message as well since one can&apos;t expect all<br/>programs, device drivers etc to simultaneously update to the new standard, and old<br/>hardware never can be updated, so a program must be able to handle both types of note<br/>on - and there has to be a message to tell a midi synth which one is currently in use for<br/>any particular device - and there must be an option in the user interface for the user to tell<br/>any particular midi program to send only the old two byte note ons to a particular synth if<br/>the user knows e.g. that it is a hardware synth or has not yet been coded for the newer 5<br/>byte note ons of your proposal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The amount of recoding you are talking about there is huge, many thousands or more<br/>of programmer years I would guess if all existing midi software were updated in this way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the rpns only affect the sending and receiving programs and nothing else in<br/>between, and is backwards compatible - as the receiving synth if it doesn&apos;t receive these<br/>extra rpns will just parse the midi stream as usual - it can include MTS sysexes, and<br/>standard pitch bends as well as the two new types of pitch bend message - and most<br/>programs won&apos;t use the new pitch bend messages to start with, but you just need one soft<br/>synth and one sending program that does use them and that is enough to start a user<br/>base. Then  if it is useful enough the new messages could then spread to other programs<br/>if enough users demand them to be introduced. So fully backwards compatible and it does<br/>introduce a couple of new RPNs - but there are plenty of those not yet taken up. Does<br/>need that to be approved in some way, don&apos;t know what the process is - or you could just<br/>introduce them experimentally in programs flagged clearly as beta software for users, and<br/>then use those programs as reasons to update the midi spec to permit them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not so elegant, but would work, is backward compatible, and you can continue to use<br/>standard pitch bends and MTS sysexes and this just adds another layer on top of them<br/>that has no effect if not present.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want to get something underway, and spread widely, something that requires a<br/>minimum of coding to include it is I think more likely to be widely accepted, not<br/>necessarily this idea, but some idea that requires similarly minimal recoding at the low<br/>level in midi, and preferably backwards compatible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For something more elegant than midi while more data redundant, really one needs a<br/>new format altogether, midi comes from a time when single bytes were precious and<br/>transmission rates were slow, and formats used the minimum number of bytes - it is<br/>elegant in that sense of minimising the number of bytes, but not in the sense of<br/>transparency or permitting easy future expansion, and if that is ones objective one should<br/>really prob. start again and make a new up to date format for modern conditions - though<br/>it could be one with strong  affinities with midi.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If ones objective is to not change the midi spec at all, ones efforts might perhaps be<br/>best put towards trying for more widespread adoption of MTS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The extra bytes are a nice idea at a high level, it is just that it doesn&apos;t work at a low level<br/>because of the particular way that midi was implemented at a low level. If it was more of a<br/>packet or tagged type format then the change would be trivial - but of course such<br/>formats use more bytes so would have been inappropriate to adopt at the time that the<br/>midi format was originally devised. Just a matter of particular historical circumstances<br/>which we can&apos;t do anything about and have to work with because of the widespread<br/>popularity of midi - well deserved I think because it is a fine format of its type, just that it<br/>has been so successful that it has lived on to times when the limitations in place when it<br/>was invented no longer apply.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ..........<br/>&gt; Thanks Robert, for explaining your idea again here. If the spec<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t changing, then NRPS or non-registered parameter numbers<br/>&gt; would need to be used, since by definition RPNs mean something<br/>&gt; in the spec. It could be done, both in hardware and software, as<br/>&gt; you say. Since MIDI was created as a hardware interconnect protocol,<br/>&gt; in response to a lack thereof, for anything MIDI I tend to think<br/>&gt; about hardware first. A problem with this will be accessing the source<br/>&gt; for multiple notes in small intervals, especially if it is a sample,<br/>&gt; when the note number is the same but the tuning is different,<br/>&gt; such as an A + 4 cents and an A - 49 cents at the same time.<br/>&gt; In software you can work around it, but hardware?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Re: the problem you point out with the 5-byte message screwing up<br/>&gt; existing MIDI apps, APIs, etc. Yes, but this would not happen after the<br/>&gt; MIDI spec changes, because when the spec changes it will be<br/>&gt; supported. MMA members will not ignore a change to basic MIDI<br/>&gt; messages in the official spec. Microsoft and everyone else will have<br/>&gt; to update their drivers. That&apos;s how the rest of the techno-world functions;<br/>&gt; it&apos;s about time MIDI started working the same way.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2007 2:34:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Manuel Op de Coul&quot;<br/>&lt;manuel.op.de.coul@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;And why do we still get the track limitations with this system?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which track limitations?</p><p>Where using pitch bends when there are too many parts<br/>causes Scala to crap out.</p></div><h3>Charles Lucy &#x3C;lucy@harmonics.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2007 4:02:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have tended to avoid using .scl and other file formats for microtuning, for many reasons.</p><p>One of those reasons is because meantone tunings usually seem to be listed in a very limited way and unable to handle more exotic &quot;scales&quot; using .scl and other file formats.</p><p>May I suggest that for all meantone type tunings only two values are needed:</p><p>a) the octave ratio - usually exactly two.</p><p>b) the size of the Large interval (e.g. between the fourth and the fifth)</p><p>Using a) and b) can unambiguously define the parameters of any meantone tuning.</p><p>Having defined any meantone tuning, we now need to set a reference pitch to a particular midinote.</p><p>(My own preference is A=440Hz, and octave equivalents for ratio 2 meantones)</p><p>Now the problem arises;</p><p>To provide a reasonable selection of playable scales, in diverse keys there need to be a plethora of files for each meantone tuning.</p><p>I have publicly limited my freely available downloads to about 50 for &quot;consonant&quot; LucyTunings.</p><p>This could be reduced by examining the sequence of interval patterns which can be viewed as transpositions, yet transposing in this way shifts the reference pitch to midinote relationship.</p><p>If we could agree on the definition parameters for all meantones, it should also be possible to agree a number of standard patterns which could be applied to all and every meantone tuning.</p><p>This would result in 50 + files for each meantone, but at least we could all understand exactly what tuning each meantone tuning file should produce.</p><p>This same system could be applied to the edo scales which are also obviously &quot;circular meantones&quot;. e.g. 19, 31, 53, 88 etc. which are presently also often confusingly mapped or non-existent.</p><p>I appreciate that this approach will result in thousands of different tuning files, yet with the ubiquity of broadband, cheap hard drives/storage, and multimegabyte applications and programmes, the</p><p>present technology can easily handle the traffic and storage volumes necessary to transmit and host them.</p><p>As things stand at present, I accept responsibility for tuning files downloadable from the <a href="http://lucytune.com">lucytune.com</a> site only;</p><p>and zero blame for the multiple supposedly Lucy tuning files, which others may have misguidedly and erroneously produced and published on the net or bundled with various applications and programmes.</p><p>Comments, flames, etc. welcomed;-)</p><p>Charles Lucy <a href="mailto:lucy@lucytune.com">lucy@lucytune.com</a></p><p>-----  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -----</p><p>For information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>LucyTuned Lullabies (from around the world):<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p><p>Skype user = lucytune</p><p>On 5 Apr 2007, at 22:34, Gene Ward Smith wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Manuel Op de Coul&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;manuel.op.de.coul@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;And why do we still get the track limitations with this system?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Which track limitations?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where using pitch bends when there are too many parts<br/>&gt; causes Scala to crap out.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2007 5:08:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; May I suggest that for all meantone type tunings only two values<br/>are<br/>&gt; needed:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a) the octave ratio - usually exactly two.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; b) the size of the Large interval (e.g. between the fourth and the<br/>&gt; fifth)</p><p>A Scala seq file can use LT notation.

I ha ven&apos;t really got the time to work on it in a sufficiently thorough way to do it justice right now.<br/>.................................<br/>Another option might be to just convert to a midi file but with the extra RPNs used to give appropriate &quot;pitch bends&quot; before each note - i.e. work out the extra rpns format, and use those in a regular type of midi file but just with the extra rpns inserted as they would be to get it played correctly tuned on a midi player able to respond to them.</p><p>The midi file then wouldn&apos;t be particularly user friendly to read, but it would be very easy to modify ones programming for playing midi files to detect the rpns in it and use those as extra pitch bends for the appropriate notes. So would minimise the amount of coding needed all round.</p><p>.................................<br/>Maybe use .seq as a user readable text format. To play it, Scala would convert that via command line args into the rpn midi format, and the player then plays that by using the rpns as extra pitch bends for notes that follow them, or for just a particular note number following, as appr.</p><p>Programs that want to save to a user readable text format could use a simplified version of the Scala .seq. format as a common format, using any of the .seq options as convenient. So long as the program only saves to .seq instead of reading from it then it doesn&apos;t need to keep up to date with latest developments for .seq, and doesn&apos;t need to program all the notations and various other options that make the .seq. files more user friendly for editing.</p><p>If it were nec. to read a .seq. file not for playing (not sure what for but if it is a common format, may be needed in some way), if there were some Scala command line option to convert a .seq. file to a &quot;simplified .seq.&quot; of some sort then it would then be poss. for programs to input .seq. files by calling Scala on a more complex user edited .seq. file.</p><p>Just a few thoughts. It would need more careful thought I&apos;m sure before actually setting down to do anything about it.</p><p>Robert</p><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; There is already a text-based file format that can be used for<br/>&gt;&gt; microtonal scores ... a Csound score file.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, because that requires an orc file to go with it,<br/>&gt; and there isn&apos;t anything like GM.

It&apos;s the best system I know of, at any rate.</p><p>This is to do with the programming side of things rather than the user&apos;s point of view. So long as there is a converter available to convert .seq files to something more like midi in the background then there would be no problem and one could use the full .seq format too, not just a subset of it.</p><p>The thing is that  you can only say that your program is able to play a format if it will play any file of that format that you throw at it.</p><p>Otherwise your player is &quot;broken&quot; - and your job is never quite done until you can play all the formats that a user may ask your program to be able to play. Right now you feel only four formats are needed - well four very flexible formats is still a fair amount to code for! Especially for parsing, which is harder than saving. Then - some time in the future maybe you will find some other format essential for some particular project in some not foreseen way, and may then press for it to be added too (very natural and nothing wrong about that too - I would in such a position anyway).</p><p>But have an automatic pre-processor of .seq files to something else much closer to midi or even to valid midi with MTS sysexes embedded in it for the tunings - and then it is no longer a problem at all.</p><p>From the point of view of the user then it is the same more or less - they can write .seq files by hand and play them immediately in the player (don&apos;t need to concern themselves that it is automatically converted to an intermediate file in the background as it can all be done invisibly). They can also record to .seq files as well, and give them the choice of those four formats to save their playing in prob.</p><p>But require that the player can play .seq files directly and the coding immediately becomes far more involved, and  you are less likely I think to get much take up. From the user&apos;s point of view, there is hardly any difference, maybe a slight extra delay when they press the play button for SCALA to launch invisibly and the file to get converted.</p><p>Recording to .seq format is different. It is easier to save in a format than to parse it for input anyway - and it would be reasonable to start with e.g. just the ratios and cents - then add the other two later on if there was enough user demand and one had the time to do it - and then gradually add more .seq options as required and depending on the time available, ones own enthusiasm for the project, and feedback from users who find the .seq save useful to them. The difference is that unlike the player, your recorder isn&apos;t broken in any way, just a bit less versatile, and this is also far less likely to lead to complaints and requests to fix it. With a player there is a natural reluctance to embark on a project which you know will cause frustration for the user from time to time when they maybe come across a .seq file somewhere which they want to play and find that your player won&apos;t play it, or make such a file themselves and find it won&apos;t play it.</p><p>I agree with you on CSound BTW that it is just too different from midi to be useful in this particular context where the music is to be played on a slightly modified microtonal midi player with as few coding changes as possible.</p><p>Best is prob. the MTS sysexes which may require no work at all for the player if it is already coded to recognise them - and I expect SCALA could convert a .seq file to a midi file with MTS sysexes in it?</p><p>Or the rpns idea (or just polyphonic pitch bends for the situation where no pitch bending of notes is needed while they are held on). Advantage of those is that the player doesn&apos;t need to parse sysexes. The MTS sysexes are straightforward to parse but there are a few &quot;gotchas&quot; just making sure one keeps track of the position in the sysex in the correct fashion as you go through it - there is enough involved in it to require some debugging and testing rather than to just write it out and expect it to work straight off with hardly any testing at all. It&apos;s a fair amount of work for a coder if they haven&apos;t already got the code to parse MTS sysexes - well it took me long enough with FTS, can&apos;t remember now how long exactly, but long enough. Adding code to parse the extra RPNs to polyphonic pitch bends would be far easier from the programming point of view if one doesn&apos;t have the MTS sysexes already coded for, but of course isn&apos;t standard midi.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Robert walker &#x3C;robertwalker@robertinventor.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2007 4:51:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>Perhaps it isn&apos;t clear how the automatic conversion would work.</p><p>The way I&apos;ve done it in other similar situations - from the user&apos;s point of view - the playing program (e.g. the retuning midi player for FTS) would just show the user a list of .seq files in the current folder. User selects one of them and clicks the Play button. The player then plays the file.</p><p>What is happening in the background is that when the user clicks Play, the player calls SCALA with the file on the command line in some way - and SCALA converts it to a temporary .mid file with MTS sysexes (or whatever is appr.). Once the .mid file has been completed, then the player plays that. When it is finished playing, then the .mid file is deleted (though there could also be a user selectable option to keep the .mid file, and only remake it if the .seq file is newer).</p><p>But user sees none of this - just sees the .seq file listed, and click the Play button to hear it.</p><p>So long as SCALA can convert a .seq file passed on the command line to a .midi file, and also can be started invisibly (some programs don&apos;t let themselves be started invisibly - you start them hidden but they show themselves a moment or two later anyway) - then all is fine. It might be nec. to use the non GUI version of SCALA for command line conversions, if so, requires the user to install it before they can play .seq files - well you would need to consult with Manuel if one wants to take the whole thing further in this part. direction, but this gives an idea of the sort of thing that may be poss.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2007 5:29:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;paolovalladolid&quot; &lt;phv40@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; GM is not that great, but what else is there?

Yes you are right!<br/>If the time delta is small enough then the 1 isn&apos;t needed and it could be confused with a data byte if one didn&apos;t know the length of the preceding message. Then the next status byte would be taken as time delta, its first data byte as the second byte of a time delta and you only know that you have a corrupted midi file by the time you get to the second data byte (if present).</p><p>Yes you are correct, and so was I originally as you said.
