In the<br/>just version, I used some rather abrupt comma shifts (gliding<br/>over perhaps half a second or so) to keep in tune with the<br/>harmonies as they shifted.

Johnny :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; johnny, i notice that monz&apos;s dictionary isn&apos;t clear on this<br/>&gt; distinction, and contains links that can cause one to confuse the<br/>two.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so for you and monz:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a shift is an *immediate* change in the pitch of a note, as the<br/>note<br/>&gt; is held or repeated from one harmony into another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a drift is an overall pitch change of the entire scale. its effect<br/>on<br/>&gt; the pitch of any note doesn&apos;t become evident until an entire &quot;comma<br/>&gt; pump&quot; chord progression has been traversed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; for example, in the classic problem of rendering the I-vi-ii-V-I<br/>&gt; progression in strict JI, one either has a shift (the 2nd scale<br/>&gt; degree shifts from 10/9 in the ii chord to 9/8 in the V chord) and<br/>no<br/>&gt; drift, or a drift (the final I is lower by 80:81 than the initial<br/>I)<br/>&gt; and no shifts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; personally, i prefer *adaptive* JI (e.g., vicentino&apos;s second tuning<br/>&gt; of 1555), so that each chord maintains perfect justness, but there<br/>&gt; are no audible shifts, and, for what it&apos;s worth, no drift.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but i have no earth-shattering objections to your rendition of<br/>&gt; binchois, which drifts by a few commas, as most people probably<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t notice anyway . . . :)</p><p>***This was, actually, a *very* clear definition of this...</p><p>CALLING MONZ... or the FAQ!</p><p>They should obviously both be linked, too, if you get my drift.</p><p>(Sorry, used that joke before...)</p><p>J.

The result was that<br/>wathever was the care to obtain a natural speech tone, if there is no<br/>breath pause, the result is litteraly suffocating for the auditor!!<br/>Hearing speech without breathing pause make most people feel<br/>inconfortable (even though most people do not realize why). The same<br/>disconfort can be created by editing out the breathing pause from<br/>natural voice. I think that is what musical phrasing is basically<br/>about: reproduce the breathing patterns of spoken or song voice. This<br/>comes naturally for wind instruments, but not so naturally for<br/>keyboard or bowed instrument.</p><p>To caricature a bit, good phrasing produce a &quot;karaoke syndrome&quot;: the<br/>urge to sign along. I have, for instance, this feeling with Casal&apos;s<br/>performance of Bach&apos;s cello suites (and not that much with most other<br/>cellists). A bad phrasing makes it difficult to establish a mental<br/>correspondance with singing voice.</p><p>Obviously, &apos;breath group&apos; is not the only one thing about phrasing for<br/>song voice, there is also the correspondance between the prosodic (or<br/>metric) structure of the language itself and the music.
