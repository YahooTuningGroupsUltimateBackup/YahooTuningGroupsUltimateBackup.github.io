A most informative online article about gearing and friction, which<br/>translates to piano actions, is on the NASA site. So I guess it&apos;s<br/>official - it _is_, or at least it can be rocket science. ;)</p><p>Modern pianos more or less have plain wire inharmonicity double each<br/>progressively higher octave; speaking lengths are reduced by about 47%<br/>and wire by 2 sizes or so. Albert Sanderson&apos;s widely used IH formulas<br/>were averaged from measurements of instruments (as with Robert Young&apos;s<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.afn.org/~afn49304/young.html">http://www.afn.org/~afn49304/young.html</a>&gt;, and others), and common<br/>scaling factors are percent of tensile breaking strength, impedance and<br/>&apos;power&apos;; yet other factors in the behavior of a wire include material<br/>and temper, terminations, waste lengths, bridge mass, soundboard<br/>stiffness, loading and mass, hammer mass, even other vibrating unison<br/>strings and duplexes.</p><p>Many calculated bass string inharmonicity curves do no intersect that of<br/>the tenor and treble strings, and which results in an audible break<br/>corresponding with the physical one. Our rescaling attempts to correct<br/>this and other problems in original scales, often yielding curves (since<br/>IH influences tuning and stretch) to an extent that resemble the Rhodes<br/>stretch tuning posted by Joe Monzo.</p><p>C.V. Raman&apos;s article &quot;On some Indian stringed instruments&quot;<br/>(&lt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Facility/4118/raman/strings.html">http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Facility/4118/raman/strings.html</a>&gt;)<br/>describes vina and tanpura not obeying the Young-Helmholtz Law due their<br/>special bridges; two articles discuss the presence - if reduced in<br/>amplitude - of partials corresponding to piano hammer striking points at<br/>string nodes (Young&apos;s cited in one for pointing out they aren&apos;t<br/>missing): Donald Hall and Peter Clark&apos;s &quot;The Question of Missing Modes&quot;<br/>(JASA 82, p1913-1918), and K.A. Legge and N.H. Fletcher&apos;s &quot;Nonlinear<br/>Generation of Missing Modes on a Vibrating String&quot; (JASA 76, p.5-13).</p><p>Gabriel Weinreich&apos;s &quot;Coupled Piano Strings&quot; describes more in depth the<br/>effects of deliberate mistuning of unison strings that Benade reports,<br/>findings which John Sankey concludes affect single strings besides<br/>(&lt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/Studio/1714/string.html">http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/Studio/1714/string.html</a>&gt;). In quite an<br/>interesting parallel of the influence mentioned here of pickups on<br/>guitar strings, more intentionally, John Stuart (Stuart &amp; Sons, AU) is<br/>using magnets to change the vibratory patterns of piano strings.</p><p>Fourier transforms for three concert pianos are at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://wapin.com/howitworks.htm">http://wapin.com/howitworks.htm</a>&gt;, showing how variable are the number<br/>of partials at least for one instrument family.</p><p>The amplitudes and even number of these partials can degenerate with<br/>time, especially with wound bass strings and there have been a few novel<br/>products intended to prevent build-up of dirt and corrosion with various<br/>barriers, from plating to sprayed-on synthetics. (I never changed<br/>strings when I played guitar - yuck!).</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2000 6:22:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Clark wrote...</p><p>&gt;Hi,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Slowly I&apos;m catching up with messages!</p><p>Hey, dude!
