But as Paul Erlich pointed out, you should<br/>not find the _correct_ mapping to be a problem, with errors less than<br/>4 cents. 53-tET would be nowhere near as kind to your scale.</p><p>Rami&apos;s gamut in its rational description has only one kind of<br/>step-wise &quot;tetrachord&quot; (undecachord?), which in steps of 72-tET is<br/>(approximately):<br/>5 2 5 2 2 3 4 3 2 2<br/>This allows for tetrachords (where no step is smaller than 6 or larger<br/>than 18) of<br/> 7  7 16<br/> 7  9 14<br/> 7 12 11  Xenakis<br/> 7 16  7<br/>12  7 11<br/>12 11  7  Xenakis<br/>14  9  7<br/>16  7  7</p><p>The disjunction is always 12 steps.</p><p>But when Rami&apos;s gamut is _correctly_ mapped to 72-tET (or the<br/>Secor/MIRACLE temperament and maybe the Keenan planar temperament) it<br/>has 2 more &quot;undecachords&quot;.<br/>2 5 2 5 2 2 3 4 3 2<br/>2 2 5 2 5 2 2 3 4 3<br/>which allow for these additional tetrachords:<br/> 7 11 12  Xenakis<br/> 7 14  9<br/> 9  7 14<br/> 9  9 12  Bilalis (proposed practice)<br/> 9 12  9  Bilalis (proposed practice)<br/> 9 11 10<br/> 9 14  7<br/>11  7 12  Xenakis<br/>11  9 10<br/>11 12  7  Xenakis<br/>14  7  9<br/>16  7  7</p><p>Note that Rami&apos;s gamut doesn&apos;t contain _any_ intervals of 6 or 8<br/>(72-tET steps).
