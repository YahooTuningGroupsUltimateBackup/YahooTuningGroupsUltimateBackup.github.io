Heaviside&apos;s uncle was Charles Whetstone (whose name is attached to the &quot;Whetstone Bridge&quot; used in the study of electricity, although he didn&apos;t actually invent it, and apparently didn&apos;t claim to).  From page 19 (the footnote also comes from the book):</p><p>&quot;With such a wonderful uncle as this is it no surprise that Oliver soon developed a lifelong interest in music, and learned to play the piano[*] and the aeolian.&quot;</p><p>[*] O. Heaviside, &quot;Pianoforte touch&quot;, Nature, vol. 91, p. 397, June 19, 1913. Heaviside once modestly related to a friend, &quot;I have no technical knowledge [of music] nor am I a pianist, though I once taught myself B.&apos;s Opus 90.  I liked it better than anything else.&quot;</p><p>- Dave</p><p>John Chalmers wrote:</p><p>&gt;Jeff and Dave--thank you both. I too doubt it was microtonal, but it<br/>&gt;might be adaptable.
