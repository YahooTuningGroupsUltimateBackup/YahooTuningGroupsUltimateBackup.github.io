I introduced him and Ray Kennedy to the<br/>Young temperament when they leased a Steinway from me for their studio, and<br/>it bowled them over!  Gives me some vindication that there is more than one<br/>way to tune a piano.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I&apos;ve been hearing about your Beethoven cd - and I was wondering if</p><p>you could provide me with info about where to get it,</p><p>You can send a check for $16 and I will mail it to you.<br/>Ed Foote<br/>1506 Cedar Lane<br/>Nashville, Tn. 37212</p><p>&gt;as well as</p><p>where to find other meantone and possibly ji recordings of baroque to</p><p>romantic works.  Reccomendations would be wonderful.&gt;&gt;</p><p>Well,  sadly, there is only one other that I know of, a CD of the Diabelli<br/>Variations done by Susan Halligan,(Yamaha C7 in a Kirnberger). There may be<br/>others commercially available, but not usually on the modern piano. Dave Hill<br/>has numerous recordings of meantone on a piano, but I don&apos;t know that they<br/>are commercially available.  Dave???<br/>    Malcolm Bilson put out the entire Beethoven sonatas, but they are<br/>recorded on fortepianos and the various students did their own tuning,  so<br/>who knows what one is listening to.<br/>Thanks for the note,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div>
