(Monz, this may be wrong... you may contradict<br/>&gt; me here...)</p><p>oh no, i think you&apos;re right about that.  i&apos;ve thought a lot<br/>about musical notation over the years, and have invented<br/>several different new notations.  but i do believe that<br/>Dave and George have invested an enormous amount of work<br/>over the last couple of years in developing sagittal.  and<br/>sagittal is much more comprehensive in its ability to include<br/>many different notations with the same symbols.</p><p>my HEWM started life as a JI notation which was specifically<br/>intended to be an improvement on Johnston notation.  when<br/>72edo become popular around here two years ago, i adopted<br/>that as an easier method for any limit up to 11.</p><p>the main difference between the two versions is that<br/>JI-HEWM is exact, with every pair of symbols representing<br/>one prime-factor above 5, whereas 72edo-HEWM uses the<br/>accidentals as approximations quantized to 72edo.</p><p>i never made any attempt to have HEWM work in, say,<br/>19edo, 31edo, or 53edo, or any fraction-of-a-comma meantones.</p><p>&gt; But, in any case, I&apos;m about ready for a switch, if I can find<br/>&gt; something satisfactory.</p><p>after i become more familiar with sagittal, i may also<br/>decide that it is superior to HEWM for JI and 72edo.<br/>(or i may not) but for all other cases, i&apos;m already certain<br/>that it&apos;s the best comprehensive microtonal notational system.</p><p>&gt; As I mentioned, my association with the Boston microtonalists<br/>&gt; is marginal at best and my music is quite a bit different<br/>&gt; from their directions, for the most part, so I have no<br/>&gt; particular necessity to be associated with them notationally...</p><p>that&apos;s good to know!  and it sure sounds like a switch in<br/>your thinking.  you used the &quot;weight&quot; of use by the Boston<br/>community as part of your argument against HEWM in the past.<br/>glad to have you with me now!  now let&apos;s convince *them*<br/>that HEWM is better!  ;-)</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=47617 href="#47617">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2003 1:10:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_47609.html#47616">/tuning/topicId_47609.html#47616</a></p><p>&gt; that&apos;s good to know!  and it sure sounds like a switch in<br/>&gt; your thinking.  you used the &quot;weight&quot; of use by the Boston<br/>&gt; community as part of your argument against HEWM in the past.<br/>&gt; glad to have you with me now!  now let&apos;s convince *them*<br/>&gt; that HEWM is better!  ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p><p>***Well, they&apos;re a minority of a minority.
