Paul Erlich has<br/>&gt;suggested that, in the case of Pelog, it is the problem of<br/>&gt;approximating 4:5 and 5:6 frequency ratios with a short chain of<br/>&gt;approximate 2:3&apos;s, even shorter than that of meantone. Paul&apos;s argument<br/>&gt;relies on inharmonic timbres to eliminate the objectionable nature of<br/>&gt;the 24 cent errors involved. Unfortunately, this doesn&apos;t work for<br/>&gt;bamboo pipes. I think there may be some other explanation of the [678]<br/>&gt;cent generator.</p><p>    ::jokin&apos; sweet&amp;sour:: Mayhaps it just sounds more right, good and roundly<br/>beautiful than the rather thin, anemic &quot;Western&quot; 12tET 5th, eh?  0_o?<br/>*gigglabyte!*</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang,<br/>musical mad scientist (no, I don&apos;t wanna take over the world, just the sound<br/>spectrum...)</p><p>    &quot;What strange risk of hearing can bring sound to music - a hearing whose<br/>obligation awakens a sensibility so new that it is forever a unique, new-born,<br/>anti-death surprise, created now and now and now. .. a hearing whose moment<br/>in time is always daybreak.&quot;  - Lucia Dlugoszewski</p><p>&quot;The wonderousness of the human mind is too great to be transferred into<br/>music only by 7 or 12 elements of tone steps in one octave.&quot; - shakuhachi master<br/>Masayuki Koga</p><p>&quot;Music is the art of thinking with sounds.&quot; - Combarieu</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s a rabbinical tradition that the music in heaven will be microtonal&quot;<br/>-annotative interpretation of Schottenstein Tehillim, 92:4, the verse being:<br/>&quot;Upon a ten-stringed * instrument and upon lyre, with singing accompanied by<br/>harp.&quot; [* utilizing new tones]</p><p>NADA BRAHMA - Sanskrit, &quot;sound [is the] Godhead&quot;</p><p>&quot;God utters me like a word containing a partial thought of himself.&quot; -Thomas<br/>Merton</p><p>LILA - Sanskrit, &quot;divine play/sport/whimsy&quot; - &quot;the universe is what happens<br/>when God wants to play&quot; - &quot;joyous exercise of spontaneity involved in the art<br/>of creation&quot;</p><p>...improvisation is about change, about flux rather than stasis. ... you have<br/>to be aware of the fact that improvisation is about a constant change. -<br/>Steve Beresford</p><p>improvisation: &quot;a process of liberation, a working around the assumptions<br/>that define our civilization, and the results are open-ended.&quot; - John Berndt</p></div><h3>Martin Braun &#x3C;nombraun@telia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2003 1:11:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hanuman Zhang:</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;     - &quot;primitive Pelog&quot; (IIRC cited by Colin McPhee):<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;         102 , 258, 522, 678, 780, 936, 1200</p><p>There is now a sufficient amount of hard data on pelog.
