This looks to be long and ugly (my post, that is!)</p><p>[I&apos;m on digest so I&apos;ll answer in the order the posts came in.]</p><p>&gt;From: Allen Strange<br/>&gt;Indeed-  I think it was Bewitched (1955?) that Harry used real-time<br/>&gt;recording/performance to record live one section of the dance to be<br/>&gt;played back later in the pieces at twice the speed (of course 8va<br/>&gt;higher).</p><p>Allen, that is a small error: Partch *never* used &quot;live&quot; electronics; Daniel Wolf mentions (pretty categorically) his uses of tape. The prime occurrences are in two pieces: the opening of &quot;Revelation in the Courthouse Park&quot; utilizes a tape of the cloud chamber bowls being played back half-speed (or they were recorded double-speed -- whatever, the effect is to drop pitch an ~octave), and more &apos;famously&apos; the use of the tape in first &quot;Windsong&quot; and it&apos;s later counterpart, &quot;Daphne of the Dunes&quot;. Here, Partch used recordings that were both twice as fast and twice as slow as the original: for sonic effects, for drones, for interest. The initial incarnation of the piece, as a film score, is notable for being such an early use of (relatively) primitive overdubbing, Partch having recorded all the parts himself. (Some of this can actually be seen in Madelaine Tourtelot&apos;s film &quot;Music Studio&quot;).</p><p>I didn&apos;t remember the tape in &quot;Water! Water!&quot;, but since it has only been produced once (the premier) I am not as familiar with it. (As an aside: when I was preparing the master tape transfers for CRI and their Partch series, I freaked out when I first put on the tape of WW, because as it came to certain sections there was a low-frequency hum that could *not* be ignored! I feared the tape had been damaged, and went to other dubs: there too. I pulled out my vinyl: ditto. I looked at the score -- every time it occurred, it was during the vigorous playing of the Marimba Eroica, one bar in particular as I recall. Huge standing wave distortion in the too-small recording room. Nothing to be done about it at this point...!)</p><p>And good call to Daniel about the extended overdubbing of &quot;Petals...&quot;. The overdubbing in &quot;Intrusions&quot; was mainly circumstance (only a handful of people to do it) and would have normally been played tutti. The recording and mixing of &quot;The Dreamer That Remains&quot; was Partch&apos;s only encounter with a professional multi-track recording scenario, and he very much enjoyed the flexibility it gave him in the mixdowns.</p><p>Though all of this (about recording) is in contrast to Harry&apos;s true aim: live performance. Recordings were for him, at best, a compromise, a way of earnings, and a small way of encouraging others to experience his work live. He had a love/hate relationship with recordings most of his life.</p><p>&gt;This was one of the first instances of &quot;live electronic music&quot; that I know of!</p><p>Well, um, I guess we debunked that! I hope you have other instances that can warm the cockles of your heart, Allen!  :)</p><p>&gt;I heard a performance last year with NewBand in San Francisco- correct me &gt;if I am wrong about the piece and/or date.</p><p>They played &quot;Daphne&quot;, so you heard correctly.</p><p>{Daniel Wolf}<br/>&gt;When he wanted a string quartet (as in _Water! Water!_, but definitely not &gt;in _Barstow_) he asked for it.</p><p>...and stuck it in to underline, sarcastically, the politically and morally bankrupt heart of Her Honor, the Mayor of Santa Mystiana.</p><p>{DW}<br/>&gt;He did indeed consider electronic alternatives to the harmonium (at least &gt;once in a less-than-serious scam to reroute research funds)</p><p>I&apos;ll mention this in a moment...</p><p>{Bill again:}<br/>&gt;If I fully understand your descriptions (which I likely don&apos;t), I don&apos;t see<br/>&gt;any major problems to electronic reproduction of the Chromelodeon.</p><p>I would suggest watching Partch play, probably at least slightly toasted, the climatic scene of &quot;Revelation&quot; on the Chromelodeon (solo) at the opening of the film &quot;The Dreamer That Remains&quot;. I&apos;d love to see that kind of physicality, as transmitted from the body into an instrument that kicks and screams and wheezes, transferred into a current keyboard/MIDI realization. I don&apos;t believe for a minute that, at least someday, physical modeling or other technology could come close to this. But the Herculean effort could be better spent find a cure for some disease or helping the homeless...or finding and retuning a reed organ.</p><p>{And now, some from Johnny Reinhard}<br/>&gt; &gt;  What do you mean &quot;not been printed&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Only that the Partch I quoted had not been previously posted to this list.</p><p>Well, then say that! It read, to me, as &apos;never before seen the light of day&apos;. An entirely different serving of tapioca.</p><p>&gt;Jon, it would be helpful if you know of other ambiguities and promise to read<br/>&gt;through Enclosure 3 faster.  It is a very heavy book.</p><p>On this subject, with a quick glance, I found a very pertinent section in Gilmore&apos;s &quot;Harry Partch&quot;; go directly to pages 190-191, where you will find full quotes of HP bemoaning the Chr., wanting to never use it again, the proposal and granting of a Guggenheim for &quot;studies toward the development of an electronic instrument&quot;, and how the money instead went for purchasing lumber and other materials for Partch&apos;s instrument building. Thus were HP&apos;s priorities.</p><p>Two important points:</p><p>1. Partch, throughout his entire life (apparently) uttered completely contradictory statements, and quite frequently during times of despair. Without being entirely categorical about it, my recollection is that when he whines about the Chr. it is usually in correlation to it&apos;s upkeep and tuning, related to weather, storage conditions, and travel. It is not hard to understand that he would want a suitable alternative. I&apos;ll make up a RealAudio clip of an out-take from the &quot;Petals&quot; recording session, where Harry is positively whining about &quot;I don&apos;t care...&quot; concerning something during the recordings; it is *impossible* for Harry to have *not* cared -- he was just being petulant in Petaluma.</p><p>2. If it was so godammed important to him to have an electronic or other alternative to the Chr., seeing that (in his lifetime) he managed to build or retrofit and entire orchestra of instruments (besides the compositions, etc.), had it really been a priority *I believe he would have made it happen*. He didn&apos;t, and his music was written for, and performed on, a couple of funky old foot-pump reed organs. (Bearing in mind he made a second Bamboo Marimba, out of different bamboo with a radically different design, and had approved of the materials that eventually went into the last Boo, constructed posthumously; he was not stuck in the mud or adverse to experimentation...)</p><p>{JR}<br/>&gt;Dan Stearns?  Could you address this issue, that of piece-mail versus a<br/>&gt;complete chapter and/or book?</p><p>Yes, I read Dan&apos;s post and it is what I suspect (I also remember Dan writing to this effect earlier): it is well and good to post little snippets, and use this kind of forum as a work in progress -- everyone does it here! But to make a cohesive and compelling argument of merit and weight requires a more thorough examination of the facts and issues. As you have apparantly done, and which someday I will eagerly read -- Mr. Ives being one of my more favorite humans.</p><p>{JR}<br/>&gt;Every scholar is biased.</p><p>All humans are biased. All scholars are human. Understood already.</p><p>&gt;I was carefully laying my bias out for all to see.</p><p>The only self-referential comment was that you were an acoustic-oriented musician, which then would lead one to believe you would favor the Chromelodeon! And I *know* you don&apos;t want that!!  :)</p><p>&gt;Exactly, this is why Partch writing that he is not happy with the<br/>&gt;chromelodeon throughout much of his life is eye opening.</p><p>Harry was not happy with a lot of things in his life. They, as well, are eye opening, such as his disdain for &quot;concerts of music&quot;, intolerance, the East Coast cognoscenti in general, etc.</p><p>&gt;Not so, I only want to give the Internet readers a chance to read views<br/>&gt;contrary to the Corporeal Meadows website.</p><p>Those bastards!</p><p>&gt;Encosure 3 is very expensive, something that Harry Parch could never have &gt;afforded to buy in his lifetime, certainly if it was about a different &gt;composer than himself.  (This last sentence is pure speculation.)</p><p>Oh, come. Harry did all of his initial research into intonation in LIBRARIES! Including a trip to the British Museum: &quot;The biggest initial excitement came from the long hours he spent researching the history of intonation in the British Museum, which provided access to a much more extensive library of works on intonational theory and practice than had been available to him in California.&quot; (Gilmore, p. 105). Libraries still exist, at least in large cities. The enthusiastic seeker will find a way...</p><p>&gt;What would you suggest he is a pioneer of?</p><p>I would suggest he was a finder of ancient performance ideals, and a dreamer.</p><p>&gt;Percussion music? Just Intonation? An Indie record company?  Why not the &gt;concept of electronics?</p><p>I find the setting of text to intonation more valuable than the percussion breakthroughs, but that&apos;s just me. But in comparison to the panorama of his accomplishments (and failures), the few connections with electronics, especially in light of their limited scope in his body of work, remain of lesser import. To me.</p><p>&gt;Please share more with us.</p><p>Don&apos;t open the door, Johnny, you know I type too much! :)</p><p>&gt;As a result of the your previous postings, I ceased performances of &gt;Partch&apos;s music using electronic means.</p><p>Something I never asked you to do, BTW.</p><p>&gt;Pardon me for receiving a shock wave when reading that Partch wished for &gt;something that is now possible.</p><p>Pardon me for suggesting that you are reading far more into those statements than is actually there: he may have &quot;wished&quot; for a stable, electronic solution (and, in fact, he made similar statements on a number of occasions), but he never went down that path.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Well, that&apos;s about enough for now; I hope I haven&apos;t committed any real grave errors in fact, this was a bit hurried. I&apos;m still trying like hell to finish up some new material for the Meadows and am shockingly and morbidly behind on email correspondence. Nonetheless, Johnny wanted me to address the issue, which I guess I have, in my clumsy manner. And as for *my* biases and any that may be purveyed on the Meadows, well... those are clearly spelled out, and have been since Day One:</p><p>&quot;This site, centering on the life and works of Partch, is maintained by people who knew him, worked with him, and are familiar with what moved him.

Creating<br/>music directly on tape (or, in the early days, acetate discs) is one thing<br/>-- Pierre Schaefer had been creating pieces like that since 1948, and<br/>composers (including Hindemith, Milhaud, and Grainger) had experimented<br/>with recorded sound manipulation since the late 1920s -- but playing tape<br/>as part of a live instrumental performance is something that, as far as I<br/>know, only began with Luening&apos;s and Ussachevsky&apos;s pieces for tape and<br/>orchestra in 1953-54 and Varese&apos;s _Deserts_ in 1954. This is the background<br/>I think Allen Strange was referring to when he called Partch&apos;s use of tape<br/>in a live performance one of the first examples of &quot;live electronic music.&quot;<br/>Indeed, there are very few examples of the combination of tape and live<br/>performers in the 1950s and even the early 1960s. While it would have been<br/>even more extraordinary had Partch used tape back in 1955 as Allen first<br/>supposed, his use of it in Revelation in 1960 was quite unusual for the<br/>time.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
