I explicitly stated that certain notes were<br/>equivalent (in the same box in the diamond) because &apos;1&apos; is equivalent<br/>to &apos;3&apos; in the BP world.

Sounds interesting but without examples I&apos;m unable to<br/>follow your meaning. Could you provide some examples?</p><p>The 9 tone and 13 tone BP scales in JI are constant structures and<br/>periodicity blocks, both with 245:243 as one of the unison vectors.<br/>Is the &quot;next&quot; constant structure also going to have 245:243 as one of<br/>the unison vectors? If so, what&apos;s the other unison vector defining<br/>it? If not, I&apos;m guessing 271 tones per octave is the &quot;next&quot; constant<br/>structure? (I don&apos;t expect you to answer these questions right<br/>now . . .)</p><p>Here&apos;s a TOP BP horagram which goes out well beyond 13 notes in case<br/>it&apos;s of any interest:</p><p><a href="/tuning/files/Erlich/bigbphor.gif">/tuning/files/Erlich/bigbphor.gif</a></p></div>
