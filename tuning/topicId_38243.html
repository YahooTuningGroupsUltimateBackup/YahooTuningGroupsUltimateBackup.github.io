This way you can tweak that if you like, but it initially<br/>&gt; gives you the series at its optimum bend value... and this would be<br/>&gt; both relevant and quite handy as it keeps you from having to scroll<br/>&gt; down and cut and paste every time you tweak the period and the number<br/>&gt; of notes. Other than that it&apos;s freakin aces!</p><p>&gt; (Now if we could only get it to give each x its corresponding Scale<br/>&gt; Tree!)</p><p>Those are easy changes as it so happens<br/>(about a dozen lines of code or thereabouts) - done</p><p><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk/uo_non_oct.htm">http://tunesmithy.co.uk/uo_non_oct.htm</a></p><p>If anyone has just been browsing that page<br/>recently, old version may be in your cache<br/>- in Windows anyway, exit from internet explorer<br/>(all of its windows if you have several web pages<br/>on the go at once) and start it up again and<br/>reload the page and you should see the new<br/>changes)</p><p>Robert</p></div>
