I didn&apos;t print them, but they look correct on the screen.<br/>Look at the posting from Dan Stearns F + 1 = 0 on 1/2/99 at 2:43 PM.  He<br/>has a divide mark which is the .--. all written in one column (the mark<br/>which I learned to use for divide in elementary school).  My keyboard<br/>doesn&apos;t have it and neither does my list of ASCII characters.  Does your<br/>keyboard have it or do you have it on your ASCII list?  If so how do you do<br/>it?  You know what kind of computer I have.<br/>&#x9;By the way I have not changed the format of the new tuning.  Someone set<br/>it up for us to be sent with everyone elses non-tuning e-mail messages.  I<br/>can print each one by itself if I want to without having to print all the<br/>other ones on the listing.  I&apos;ll keep it that way at least for a while or<br/>until someone running the tuning requires us to change to format.  Other<br/>formats should be OK also if necessary.

Since we&apos;ve been over this before, I expected that you&apos;d see the unusual<br/>characters correctly.  I&apos;m glad there were no surprises.</p><p>   As for a divide mark, yes, I can produce it: &#xFFFD;  I don&apos;t know how you&apos;d go about<br/>producing it, but on the Mac, I use a thingie called PopChar, which lets me type<br/>anything in its character set with a click of a mouse button.  Or, to be more<br/>accurate, it pops them up in a menu.</p><p>   As for changing over your tuning-list, I can&apos;t recall the exact step-by-step<br/>procedure, but I&apos;ll say this much:  You&apos;re already subscribed, so all you need to<br/>do is change your &quot;address book&quot;, or whatever Microsoft calls it.  In your address<br/>book, there&apos;s probably something called &quot;tuning&quot; as a shortcut for<br/>&quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@eartha.mills.edu">tuning@eartha.mills.edu</a>&quot;.  All you have to do is change that to being a shortcut<br/>for &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a>&quot;.</p><p>   Once you&apos;re in the mail program, look for a menu entry called something &quot;Address<br/>Book&quot;, and select it.  I suspect you&apos;ll find it pretty easy to figure out from<br/>there.</p></div><h3>Gary Morrison &#x3C;mr88cet@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/1999 3:15:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Gary Morrison &lt;<a href="mailto:mr88cet@texas.net">mr88cet@texas.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Good.

The point was<br/>that, if the vast majority of us can in fact read these characters, then we<br/>can probably feel better about using them.</p><p>   The result was that most of us could view them, so, it&apos;s probably not wise<br/>to do so routinely, but it&apos;s probably OK if it becomes sufficiently<br/>inconvenient not to.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.</p><p>&gt; What is a all this about HTML?  That is not a suitable<br/>&gt; format for e-mail, is usually unreadable and I just delete such junk.</p><p>   That depends on your Email program.  Under Netscape Communicator, all of<br/>your Email is written in HTML from the start, so you can do all of the text<br/>formatting and insert graphics and sounds you&apos;d like.  It then has an option<br/>to, on a recipient-by-recipient basis, to reduce it to raw text upon sending<br/>it.  But if your recipient also has Netscape or Internet Explorer (the two<br/>most commonly-used internet programs), you&apos;ll both see all that formatting and<br/>graphics and sound and all that.</p></div>
