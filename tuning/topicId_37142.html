I had thought of a hammer<br/>dulcimer but the designs I&apos;ve seen are really quite complicated so I&apos;ll<br/>go with ol&apos; Harry&apos;s stringbox which is just within my reach.</p><p>I have three 8&quot; x 36&quot; x 1/4&quot; spruce tops that I want to make into one<br/>large board. Before I just glue and rub together I wonder if anyone has<br/>experience of this type of craftwork and can offer some tips. The tops<br/>are best quality and expensive and I don&apos;t want to botch up the job.</p><p>I&apos;ll be stringing the canon with 31 plus steel strings going from<br/>(roughly) 22s to 14s, bass to treble, so there&apos;s a slight bass to treble<br/>difference in tension, but not as much as on a guitar. Any advice on<br/>struts and bracing would be useful. Thanks in anticipation</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div>
