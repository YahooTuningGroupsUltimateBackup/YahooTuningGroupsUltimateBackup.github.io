It&apos;s my understanding that Magellan was killed on the beaches of the Phillipines by a warrior named Lapu Lapu, using the indigenous martial arts techniques found there...unfortunately, the Spanish still colonized the Filipinos a bit later, making their lives miserable for many years, and bringing the horrors of European domination, as they did all over the world. As you may know, the Church&apos;s position on indigenous people&apos;s the world over was that they were subhuman, and created by God to be slaves to the Europeans...so, with that reasoning, it was ok to take their lands, gold, rape the women, whatever, since they were destined for that fate in the first place. Works out pretty well for the invaders, not so well for the folks who lost their cultures and way of life...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>  <a href="http://guitar9.com">guitar9.com</a></p></div>
