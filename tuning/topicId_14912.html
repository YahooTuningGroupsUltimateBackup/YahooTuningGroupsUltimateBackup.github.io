All consonant dyads are not equally consonant and otonal chords<br/>&gt;are not equal to utonal.</p><p>True, but there is more to tonality than consonance.  In fact I think<br/>it&apos;s an abuse of the term to call CPSs atonal.  I think what has been<br/>meant in the past, with comparisons to the diamond, etc., is the way<br/>the common tones are distributed between the chords.</p><p>&gt;But still it&apos;s an extraordinary acheivement to get as close to atonal<br/>&gt;as this, in JI.</p><p>Not especially.  It&apos;s quite easy to use the diamond atonally.  Or, one<br/>could use a bunch of chords distant from eachother on the lattice.  The<br/>cool thing about CPS is the number of consonant chords you can use, from<br/>a small number of notes, without boring the hell out of people by having<br/>them always hear a single common frequency as in the diamond.</p><p>&gt;I think that complete atonality can only be obtained by using all the<br/>&gt;notes from some equal temperament (equal division of the octave).</p><p>I disagree, even if we take atonality to mean a lack of consonance.  One<br/>central theme of the list seems to be that the brain is hard-wired for<br/>JI... it will always hear some intervals as more consonant than others, ET<br/>or otherwise.</p><p>&gt;     5*7<br/>&gt;   ,&apos;/ \&grave;.<br/>&gt;1*5-/---\-3*5-------5*9<br/>&gt; |\/     \/|        /|\<br/>&gt; |/\     /\|       / | \<br/>&gt;1*7-------3*7-------7*9 \<br/>&gt;   &grave;.\ /,&apos;       /,&apos;   &grave;.\<br/>&gt;     1*3-------1*9-------3*9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It seems clear to me that some notes will have a much stronger pull than<br/>&gt;others because they are involved in more consonances that are simple and<br/>&gt;otonal.</p><p>Which ones are those?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2000 4:44:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan wrote...</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;It seems clear to me that some notes will have a much stronger pull than<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;others because they are involved in more consonances that are simple and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;otonal.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Which ones are those?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1*3, 1*5, 1*7, 1*9.
