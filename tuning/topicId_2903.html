If the JI pitch set is invariant,<br/>then the traditional serial transformations could produce some<br/>nifty materials since transposition has more &quot;meaning&quot; in a non-<br/>tempered environment. Another approach is, for a &apos;free JI&apos; work<br/>to make the row from the set of ratios rather fthan set of pitches<br/>and now apply the serial techniques to the ratios. There will be<br/>a LOT of drift...</p><p>Matt Fields web site has the &apos;composition gems&apos; series, one of<br/>which is about serial composition. In it he quotes Shoenberg,<br/>something to the effect of &quot;First you come up with a Row, then<br/>you write out the R, I and RI forms, then you just write music&quot;.</p><p>I think all these games (including those we spend the majority of<br/>our time discussing) are ways of getting from wanting to write<br/>a composition, to writing (or finishing!) a composition.

His point is (as illustrated by the rest of<br/>the &quot;gem&quot;) that the row is born out of an initial motive or idea which is<br/>then saturated into the subsequent row.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Jon Southwood<br/><a href="mailto:noj@cedar-rapids.net">noj@cedar-rapids.net</a></p></div>
