Those<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pseudo-clarinets/chalumeaux in there have only half the overtone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; series in them, skipping the odd partials as clarinets do.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This can&apos;t very well be it; clarinets skip the even partial tones.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Only on the distinction of starting the counting at 1 vs 0.  Partials,<br/>&gt; &gt; overtones, whatever; the half of them that would matter most here are<br/>&gt; &gt; missing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That&apos;s probably what you meant, though. Skipping the even partials and<br/>&gt;superimposing a 7 and a 9 seems nice in clarinet terms.</p><p>No; I meant what I said, but evidently I didn&apos;t say it clearly enough.  (Judging also from several off-list responses/questions from others....)</p><p>I&apos;ll try one more time.</p><p>9/7 is dangerously into &quot;bad 4/3&quot; territory.  On harpsichord, when the 9/7 is not quite in tune, the rapid beats (really a nasty buzz) from the skanky 4/3 are very audible, and they are the main thing that is noticed.  We don&apos;t hear a not-quite-resonant 9/7; we hear a thoroughly incompetent 4/3 protesting its error.  This area is both lower in pitch, and louder, than the place in the overtone series where the 9th and 7th multiples are almost lining up.</p><p>But, in &quot;clarinet&quot; timbre where the odd overtones (OK, the &quot;even partials&quot;) are missing, there&apos;s no 4th multiple in there from the lower note to bash against the 3rd multiple of the upper note.  Therefore, the beats of the incompetent 4/3 are not audible and not in our way.  Two &quot;clarinets&quot; making an almost-pure 9/7 sound much more harmonious than two harpsichord strings making the same almost-pure 9/7.</p><p>Of course, this is all moot most of the time, on harpsichord, because 9/7 doesn&apos;t come up at all except in a regular layout close to 2/7 syntonic comma....</p><p>=====</p><p>Clarification of my remarks about the &quot;purity&quot; of tritone 45/32 as a distinctive sound on harpsichord (when playing in 1/6 syntonic comma meantone): it has nothing to do, in this case, with the coincidence of the 45th multiple and 32nd multiple way up there.  A perfectly tuned 45/32 sounds pure because the ear breaks it down to pure components 9/8 and 5/4.</p><p>In Baroque figured-bass terms, the ear fills in that missing note (for example, D between the pure C-F#) and the whole thing seems like a &quot;4-2 chord&quot;, i.e. a dominant seventh in third inversion.  That&apos;s why the tritone&apos;s resolution has to happen outwards: the F# going up to G, and the C going either to B or B-flat.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=55887 href="#55887">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2004 10:59:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Clarification of my remarks about the &quot;purity&quot; of tritone 45/32 as<br/>&gt;a distinctive sound on harpsichord (when playing in 1/6 syntonic<br/>&gt;comma meantone): it has nothing to do, in this case, with the<br/>&gt;coincidence of the 45th multiple and 32nd multiple way up there.<br/>&gt;A perfectly tuned 45/32 sounds pure because the ear breaks it down<br/>&gt;to pure components 9/8 and 5/4.</p><p>This &apos;breaking down&apos; ability has been hotly contested here over a<br/>period of years.

I&apos;ve been largely convinced that nothing like<br/>&gt; this happens, unless one of the other tones is present, or was<br/>&gt; recently present.</p><p>I don&apos;t know anything that&apos;s been said about this particular<br/>phenomenon of division, one way or another, here or elsewhere.</p><p>All I know is what I hear from the 45/32 interval itself, and its<br/>usual functional position in the music of my specialty, when playing<br/>in 1/6 syntonic comma meantone.  It creates a very strong impression<br/>(being comprised of those two very simple pure components) and<br/>therefore draws extra attention to itself; and then it resolves in<br/>the way it must do in 17th-18th century music.</p><p>It makes such cadences very strong harmonic events.  It creates<br/>tension because the in-tune-ness is so sudden and startling, in<br/>context where no other available intervals (save octaves) are ever<br/>pure.  Then, the music relaxes from this dominant into the resolution<br/>of a tonic that is gently less in tune (i.e. less intense, but with<br/>medium-speed beating major thirds and fifth).</p><p>Or, if we&apos;re resolving from such a tritone into one of the augmented<br/>fifths(!) C-G#, Eb-B, F-C#, or Bb-F# (being misspelled in the music as<br/>a minor sixth), those too are very nearly pure, and therefore<br/>startling.  That is, the diminished fourths are nasty but their<br/>inversions are extremely consonant in musical context.</p><p>We&apos;re safely out of range of 25/16 since we&apos;re 2/3 of a syntonic<br/>comma sharp of it, and we&apos;re much too low from 8/5.  2/3 of a syntonic<br/>comma from 25/16 puts us into the neighborhood a tiny bit sharp of<br/>11/7, doesn&apos;t it?  (Have I caught the correct ghost?  Who in the JI<br/>family lives nearest to 786.96495 cents?)</p><p>It&apos;s one of those freaky bits in 1/6 syntonic comma meantone that<br/>lets one get away with some misspellings.  For example, playing basso<br/>continuo, if there&apos;s a notated D# in the middle of the bass staff<br/>with figured &quot;6&quot; (and resolving next to E minor...), it works in a<br/>B-F#-B spacing for the right hand; but it doesn&apos;t work if the F# is<br/>placed in the same octave as the &quot;D#&quot;.  That is: the B major triad is<br/>pretty lousy, but its first inversion (if spaced carefully!) is<br/>usable.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
