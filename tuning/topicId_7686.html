Good organ builders are despised and the<br/>bunglers receive in some pieces, shelter, and consolation.  A reasonable man<br/>who by chance gets a hold of the author&apos;s thesis or the abusing writings<br/>should confront then with my Orgel-Probe. He will see how too much is<br/>happening to me and how my good intentions are misunderstood and slandered<br/>against all reasoning.  I am amazed how envy disavows that which the eyes can<br/>see, the ears can hear, and the hands can hold, and thus dares to suppress<br/>the truth.</p><p>&quot;I confess once more that I am sincerely sorry that I have to think of the<br/>dead in my writings as I will gladly endure, as a Christian, with patience,<br/>the calumny poured upon me.  Only because the dead, as mentioned, still has<br/>some followers to whom poison has been administered with a mother&apos;s milk, and<br/>who have these writing&apos;s in their hands and thereby always still try to<br/>slander and insult me wherein the foreword of this my thesis is directed.<br/>Thus I could have had a connection through which to defend my honorable name,<br/>to defend the truth, and to free myself from further calumnies.</p><p>&quot;I would prefer that the slanderous writings were brought into open print so<br/>that one himself can be much better answerable against that; for the secret<br/>envious still stings more maliciously than the public enemies; for then the<br/>whole world could also recognize the contained poison, absurdities, and<br/>affects so much better and it would not even be necessary that one refutes<br/>the whole nonsense for the vices and the rudeness contained therein would<br/>stand completely naked anyway.&quot;</p><p>Quite an environment, no?  Somehow Kirnberger was totally squelched as<br/>&quot;old-fashioned&quot; even though he offers so much in his writings as a theorist.<br/>Johann Walther was squelched for reasons that still remain unclear.  If<br/>Werckmeister was so sure that it was only through his writings that he would<br/>be vindicated, why hasn&apos;t he been translated?  I continue to quote the<br/>translation of an Oberlin sophomore in 1967.  It is not in distribution at<br/>this time.  I hope that it opens a reader&apos;s imagination to other<br/>possibilities and probabilities than that imparted by institutionalized music<br/>education.  No one is immune, because the institutionalized education is<br/>valuable in itself.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
