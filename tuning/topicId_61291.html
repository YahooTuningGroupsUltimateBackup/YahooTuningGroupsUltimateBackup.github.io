(look at two systems at the bottom of<br/>mail) the For example if we accept major triad chord 24:30:36 or 4:5:6<br/>as a otonal relationship in the second system as otonal system, we can<br/>also see in first utonal system 1/48:1/38:1/32 or 1/24:1/19:1/16 as<br/>another version of major triad chord.</p><p>2- i wrote 1/48:1/38:1/32 or 1/24:1/19:1/16  because in utonal systems<br/>which I think it is better for me to call them &quot;&quot; constant/decreasing<br/>rational system &quot;&quot; the nominator is constant and denominator is<br/>decreasing .this system is the same when you divide the lenght of the<br/>string to equal parts which is difined by farabi in his book<br/>musighi-al-kabir , working on tanbour of baghdad.</p><p>3- vice versa , in otonal systems which I call them &quot;&quot;<br/>increasing/constant rational system &quot;&quot; the denominator is constant and<br/>nominator is increasing so the chords are for example 4:5:6 .</p><p>4- I guess the numerary nexus in partch theory is the constant part<br/>between system ratios (nominator or denominator)before simplification of<br/>ratios.</p><p>5-In tonalsoft it is mentioned that otonality is major tonality and<br/>utonality is minor :</p><p>If we assume a utonal rational system with cardinality(I use also this<br/>word like in EDO SYSTEMS) OF

that *any* collection of rational pitches can be<br/>viewed as either otonal or utonal. Usually, one perspective<br/>or the other gives smaller identity-numbers ... but there<br/>are also some cases where either classification gives the<br/>same numbers.</p><p>A perfect example of the latter is a JI minor-7th chord<br/>with ratios 1/1 - 6/5 - 3/2 - 9/5:</p><p>* In the otonal classification, the missing 1-odentity is 8/5,<br/>the numerary nexus is 5 in the denominator, and the numerator<br/>odentities, reading pitches from the bottom in ascending order,<br/>are 5, 3, 15, and 9.</p><p>* In the utonal classification, the missing 1-udentity is 9/8,<br/>the numerary nexus is 9 in the numerator, and the denominator<br/>udentities, reading pitches again from the bottom in<br/>ascending order, are 9, 15, 3, and 5.</p><p>This is made plain on a rectangular lattice:</p><p>.. 1:1 --- 3:2 -- (9:8)<br/>... | ..... | ..... |<br/>. (8:5) -- 6:5 --- 9:5</p><p>2)<br/>As klaus explained, but rather cryptically, an interval<br/>(which is a dyad, that is, only 2 notes) cannot be classified<br/>as either otonal or utonal.

On the contrary, I believe they are very much synonymous. Of course this is a feeling of mine based on the observation that Maqam Music perdes have Persian names along with many Maqams and Terkibs. Add to that the fact that Ottoman-Persian history goes hand in hand in culture, poetry and music, we are one step away from concluding that we share almost the same traditions.</p><p>You recited an example where Mukhalif is a genre of Segah. In our treatises, Mukhalifek is a Segah Maqam (E F G A B C D# E) with the third note sharpened. There is also a Hijaz-i Mukhalif, which is essentially a Hijaz Maqam (G F# Ed D) that goes down to B as in the Segah tetrachord and ends with an A.</p><p>From Fractal Tune Smithy&apos;s default Persian Tar scale, I found Mukhalif to be:</p><p>9/8 32/27 4/3 3/2 81/50 729/400 2/1</p><p>In retrospect, here are the two available Segah Dastgahs:</p><p>9/8 243/200 4/3 3/2 81/50 16/9 2/1</p><p>(Mukhalif seems to be a detuned version of this)</p><p>27/25 243/200 4/3 36/25 81/50 729/400 2/1</p><p>This last one very much resembles one of our own Segah scales.</p><p>Here is Dastgah Shur from the same source:</p><p>27/25 32/27 4/3 3/2 128/81 16/9 2/1</p><p>Shur seems to be a variant of the second Segah Dastgah above. Also, Shuri is a perpendicularly blown perde Rast (or Neva 3/2 above) in the Ney. Because of the special angle of blowing for this pitch, the technique is called the &quot;Shuri position&quot;.</p><p>It is equally important for us to preserve the pure fourth and fifth relations in Turkish Maqam Music. That is why Maqam scales are explained as tetrachords hereabouts. But I insist that there is a diatonical framework that allows tonality. That is why I conjured up 79-MOS 159-tET. I have been experimenting in delight with my new Qanun, and I do believe I have chanced upon many Dastgahs accidentally or wistfully.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Mohajeri Shahin<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 17 Ekim 2005 Pazartesi 14:53<br/>  Subject: RE: [tuning] otonal and utonal</p><p>  DEAR BROTHER OZAN</p><p>  AS YOU KNOW ,THE CONCEPT OF DASTGAH IS DIFFERENT FROM MAQAM , ALTHOUGH, IN THE PAST THEY WERE DIFFERENTIATED FROM EACH OTHER AND KNOW THEY HAVE MANY THINGS SIMILAR.</p><p>  DASTGAH IS A COMPLEX OF SOME GUSHEH .

Add<br/>to that the fact that Ottoman-Persian history goes hand in hand in<br/>culture, poetry and music, we are one step away from concluding that we<br/>share almost the same traditions.</p><p>You recited an example where Mukhalif is a genre of Segah. In our<br/>treatises, Mukhalifek is a Segah Maqam (E F G A B C D# E) with the third<br/>note sharpened. There is also a Hijaz-i Mukhalif, which is essentially a<br/>Hijaz Maqam (G F# Ed D) that goes down to B as in the Segah tetrachord<br/>and ends with an A.</p><p>From Fractal Tune Smithy&apos;s default Persian Tar scale, I found Mukhalif<br/>to be:</p><p>9/8 32/27 4/3 3/2 81/50 729/400 2/1</p><p>In retrospect, here are the two available Segah Dastgahs:</p><p>9/8 243/200 4/3 3/2 81/50 16/9 2/1</p><p>(Mukhalif seems to be a detuned version of this)</p><p>27/25 243/200 4/3 36/25 81/50 729/400 2/1</p><p>This last one very much resembles one of our own Segah scales.</p><p>Here is Dastgah Shur from the same source:</p><p>27/25 32/27 4/3 3/2 128/81 16/9 2/1</p><p>Shur seems to be a variant of the second Segah Dastgah above. Also,<br/>Shuri is a perpendicularly blown perde Rast (or Neva 3/2 above) in the<br/>Ney. Because of the special angle of blowing for this pitch, the<br/>technique is called the &quot;Shuri position&quot;.</p><p>It is equally important for us to preserve the pure fourth and fifth<br/>relations in Turkish Maqam Music. That is why Maqam scales are explained<br/>as tetrachords hereabouts. But I insist that there is a diatonical<br/>framework that allows tonality. That is why I conjured up 79-MOS<br/>159-tET. I have been experimenting in delight with my new Qanun, and I<br/>do believe I have chanced upon many Dastgahs accidentally or wistfully.</p><p>Cordially,</p><p>Ozan</p><p>&#x9;----- Original Message -----</p><p>&#x9;From: Mohajeri Shahin &lt;<a href="mailto:shahinm@kayson-ir.com">mailto:shahinm@kayson-ir.com</a>&gt;</p><p>&#x9;To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>&#x9;Sent: 17 Ekim 2005 Pazartesi 14:53</p><p>&#x9;Subject: RE: [tuning] otonal and utonal</p><p>&#x9;DEAR BROTHER OZAN</p><p>&#x9;AS YOU KNOW ,THE CONCEPT OF DASTGAH IS DIFFERENT FROM MAQAM ,<br/>ALTHOUGH, IN THE PAST THEY WERE DIFFERENTIATED FROM EACH OTHER AND KNOW<br/>THEY HAVE MANY THINGS SIMILAR.</p><p>&#x9;DASTGAH IS A COMPLEX OF SOME GUSHEH .

Have you heard of Nayi Uthman Dede and Dmitri Kantemir?</p><p>  but the framework of intervallic structure mainly in structural intervals of modes, modal movement ,&mldr;.. are specific.</p><p>What do you make of my claim that these three brothers born under the same roof are all tonal genres? And that Dastgahs/Maqams are keys rather than modes?</p><p>  You know,scales and tetrachord may be the same but the mixture of tetrachord and the way you think musically due to the rules of modes different.may be we two play in mokhalif but our taste of segah due to tuning of instrument , phrasing , &mldr;&mldr;different.</p><p>Misinterpretation, or outright denial of facts contained in historic treatises must be the cause of certain grotesque mistunings in my opinion. On the other hand, I concur that different tastes have evolved in Persia, Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries throughout the past millenium.</p><p>  I have a book in farsi by the late maestro morteza han&apos;naneh , a greate theorician and composer, working on the root of dastgah , he proposed that shur is the same as yegah , and rast is another root of persian music.according to old documents from maraghi and &mldr;.. melodic and rhythmic music of iran were bwsed on maqam concept.</p><p>It is interesting how there occured this reactionary movement both in Turkey and Iran against the original Maqam so much so that we almost entirely reverted back to the tetrachordal system of Ancient Greek and Arab theoreticians.</p><p>  like the other parts of islamic culture  but unfortunately we don&apos;t know the time of change to dastgah and loosing the rhythmic maqams.but as I mentioned before and you told we can trace the footprint of maqams from names from common structures and intonations.</p><p>The living relic, so to speak. It is a wonder how it survived all that mutilation in the hands of nationalists.</p><p>  We cant give exact scale-formula for each things in iranian music and also middle east and may be all musics based on personal approach, because of intervallic spectrum . I&apos;m working on this item to see what are the maximum and minimum limits of an interval to save the  taste of mode , indeed in degrees of good and bad . I don&apos;t mean that scales are bad or good but modal taste for example can be qualified .</p><p>Have you examined my 79 MOS 159-tET? I do believe that you can express all the tastes of Persian Art Music with this system.</p><p>  These sacles are near to theory of dr.barkeshli who told for example quarter-tones in persiam music are just minor intervals + sy. Comma , but they are only two intervals  in intervallic spectrum:</p><p>  0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime</p><p>    1:         27/25            133.238 large limma, BP small semitone</p><p>    2:        243/200           337.148 acute minor third</p><p>    3:          4/3             498.045 perfect fourth</p><p>    4:         36/25            631.283 classic diminished fifth</p><p>    5:         81/50            835.193 acute minor sixth</p><p>    6:        729/400          1039.103 acute minor seventh</p><p>    7:          2/1            1200.000 octave</p><p>  |</p><p>These would be degrees 0, 9, 22, 33, 42, 55, 68 and 79 of 79 MOS 159-tET.</p><p>  0:          1/1                 C    Dbb   unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:        135.830 cents   C#   Db<br/>  2:        332.030 cents   D#   Eb<br/>  3:        498.045 cents   F    Gbb<br/>  4:        633.875 cents   F#   Gb<br/>  5:        837.785 cents   G#   Ab<br/>  6:       1033.985 cents   A#   Bb<br/>  7:       1200.000 cents   C    Dbb</p><p>    0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime</p><p>    1:         27/25            133.238 large limma, BP small semitone</p><p>    2:         32/27            294.135 Pythagorean minor third</p><p>    3:          4/3             498.045 perfect fourth</p><p>    4:          3/2             701.955 perfect fifth</p><p>    5:        128/81            792.180 Pythagorean minor sixth</p><p>    6:         16/9             996.090 Pythagorean minor seventh</p><p>    7:          2/1            1200.000 octave</p><p>These would be degrees 0, 9, 20, 33, 46, 52, 66 and 79 of 79 MOS 159-tET.</p><p>  0:          1/1           C    Dbb   unison, perfect prime<br/>  1:        135.830 cents   C#   Db<br/>  2:        301.845 cents   D#   Eb<br/>  3:        498.045 cents   F    Gbb<br/>  4:        701.955 cents   G    Abb<br/>  5:        792.509 cents   G#   Ab<br/>  6:       1003.800 cents   A#   Bb<br/>  7:       1200.000 cents   C    Dbb</p><p>Cordially,</p><p>Ozan</p></div>
