It is used with great success in treating Alcoholism for<br/>instance.  Other people around the globe also have there own uses for there<br/>plant with equal success. They do not abuse it there by they acknowledge the<br/>&quot;nature&quot; of the substance. With Hemlock they would likewise recognize its<br/>&quot;nature&quot; and realize it is best left alone. The knowledge of herbs is not one<br/>dimensional. Golden seal for flu. etc. But the full extent of the plant of it<br/>pro and cons are always considered.<br/>    I have to concede that LSD (which is from ergot) was one of the most<br/>successful methods of rehabilitation of Criminals. Once it was realized that<br/>its effects on Prison Guards was the complete opposite, the notion of it being<br/>wide spread cure all should have been abandoned.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; To which I always responded, &quot;Yeah, so leg&apos;s try hemlock.

On the other hand, I have never<br/>seen any example of ET in nature.

On the other hand the distortion and use of<br/>noise in Grunge<br/>is not to be underestimated, or in techno. Maybe it sounds better than<br/>Schoenberg. I think there are reasons it works in some contexts and not in<br/>others!
