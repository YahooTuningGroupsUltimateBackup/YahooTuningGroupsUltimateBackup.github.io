Even with a<br/>fast connection it takes forever to load. I took Paul and<br/>Dan&apos;s advice and decided to break it up into three stations,<br/>Tuning Punks A-I, Tuning Punks J-R and Tuning Punks S-Z. Got<br/>the first one built, with about an hour worth of work, but<br/>now I can&apos;t find where it is. I can administer it, but I<br/>can&apos;t just open it, cant find it with a search, arrrrrgh! I<br/>will finish the job providing I can find my work...<br/>Really, it would be a lot faster just to pop up a web page<br/>on my server with the punks there, but then it wouldn&apos;t get<br/>the exposure. Either <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> needs to upgrade their servers,<br/>or the code behind the page calls a bunch of stuff. It<br/>really shouldn&apos;t take that long to load. Rant, rant rant...</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
