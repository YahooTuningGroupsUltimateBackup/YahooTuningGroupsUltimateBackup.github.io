The<br/>tetrachord (or division of the fourth) in this genus is based on the<br/>intervals of a major third and of two &quot;diesis&quot; each equal to about<br/>half of the remaining semitone. For example, in Pythagorean tuning,<br/>with intervals shown in rounded cents, and an asterisk (*) used to<br/>show the raising of a note by a diesis (about 45.11 cents, half of a<br/>256:243 semitone such as E-F at about 90.22 cents):</p><p> E   E*  F       A<br/> 0   45  90     498<br/>   45  45   408</p><p>On the role of the enharmonic in ancient Greek music, John Chalmers or<br/>others might be able to comment, but the basic idea is the division of<br/>a semitone into two precisely (or approximately?) equal parts.</p><p>Although the enharmonic division itself doesn&apos;t seem to play much of a<br/>role in medieval European composed polyphony, Marchettus of Padua in<br/>1318 advocates the use of an interval he terms a &quot;diesis&quot; equal to<br/>&quot;one fifth part of a tone&quot; -- whether an equal or unequal division is<br/>a point of much debate. However, if he is advocating an equal fivefold<br/>division, the mathematics would be rather different than for<br/>conventional Pythagorean tunings of the era where an interval of this<br/>size (~41 cents) does not occur with tuning sets of 17 or fewer notes<br/>of the kind discussed by theorists of the era.</p><p>Around the second quarter of the 15th century, interestingly, Ugolino<br/>of Orvieto in discussing a 17-note Pythagorean organ keyboard (Gb-A#),<br/>mentions the possibility of adding two extra notes dividing the<br/>semitones E-F and B-C into two equal parts after the &quot;ancient&quot;<br/>practice -- that is, the enharmonic genus. However, he remarks that<br/>this is not in use by the &quot;moderns,&quot; that is, in late medieval styles<br/>familiar to him.</p><p>The enharmonic genus really gets revived as a central element of style<br/>by Nicola Vicentino (1511-1576) in his treatise on _Ancient Music<br/>Adapted to Modern Practice_ (1555).</p><p>This &quot;adaption&quot; is in part evidently result of musical serendipity: in<br/>the meantone tunings favored by the 16th century for their pure or<br/>near-pure thirds (an element of the new Renaissance styles), the<br/>interval between such alternative accidentals as G# and Ab is equal to<br/>size comparable to that of the ancient enharmonic diesis. In 1/4-comma<br/>meantone with pure major thirds, for example, it is equal to 128:125<br/>or ~41.06 cents.</p><p>What Vicentino does is to take this interval, and to use it<br/>deliberately for its &quot;gentle&quot; and subtle effect in vertical and<br/>melodic progressions, building an _archicembalo_ or &quot;superharpsichord&quot;<br/>which divides the octave into 31 essentially equal diesis intervals.<br/>Actually, in a 1/4-comma tuning, there are two slightly different<br/>sizes of dieses or &quot;fifthtones&quot;: the usual meantone diesis at 128:125,<br/>and a slightly smaller fifthtone at about 34.99 cents, or ~50:49, the<br/>difference between a meantone chromatic semitone at ~76.05 cents and<br/>the larger 41-cent diesis.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s enharmonic diesis or fifthtone is &quot;microtonal&quot; in a sense<br/>beyond that of a conventional European tuning such as 12-note meantone<br/>or 12-tone equal temperament (12-tET) for lutes in the same era: the<br/>use of this interval delighted some listeners, and perplexed others<br/>such as Vincenzo Galileo, who argued that the enharmonic genus was<br/>ill-proportioned to the human ear.</p><p>How the term &quot;enharmonic&quot; came to be applied to accidentals regarded<br/>as equivalent in a given tuning, e.g. G#/Ab in 12-tET or B#/Cb in<br/>19-tET, I&apos;m not sure; but in 1/4-comma meantone, G#-Ab or B#-C is<br/>indeed equal to an &quot;enharmonic diesis,&quot; so possibly this usage derives<br/>from the enharmonicism of Vicentino and his followers in the 16th<br/>century.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
