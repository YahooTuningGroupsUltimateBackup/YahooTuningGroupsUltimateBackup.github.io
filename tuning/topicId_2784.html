There are institutions where a MA is worth it&apos;s weight in gold, and<br/>others where that and $2.75 will get you a Grande Decaf Latte (no cinnamon<br/>or anything else) at the local StarWarsBucks. It is the *student* that<br/>makes what he/she will of the course work -- we&apos;ve all known people with<br/>graduate degrees that were incredible, and then some that were ...<br/>incredible.</p><p>Please, there are better issues to argue.</p><p>Re: Orchestras, especially the San Diego Symphony.</p><p>From monz we get:<br/>&gt;And when I arrived in San Diego last fall, I found out that the San Diego<br/>&gt;Symphony had been disbanded for lack of support! (Thankfully,<br/>&gt;by December it had just reformed and begun concerts again).</p><p>Just wanted to make a small correction -- the orchestra was forced into<br/>bankruptcy by an inept management, and the only reason we are operating<br/>again is *because* of community support, not lack of it. And why do I even<br/>*play* in an orchestra? To remind myself of what Harry meant by the &quot;tight<br/>coat, tight shoes mentality&quot;...</p><p>And a paycheck.</p><p>Re: Ravi</p><p>&gt;&gt; BTW I heard and maybe this needs to be corrected  that Ravi Shankar was<br/>&gt;turned down for teaching job at<br/>&gt;&gt;UCSD because they said they considered him an &quot;untrained&quot; musician. How<br/>&gt;else could they compete!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(if this is even true) I&apos;m sure his worldwide fame from playing to overflow<br/>&gt;crowds of adoring and appreciative fans somewhat lessoned the blow of<br/>&gt;rejection.  :-) Meanwhile those who rejected him sit in their offices<br/>&gt;pushing paper and sucking up to rich old ladies to try and raise money.</p><p>So that you all are aware of the true situation, Ravi Shankar was given a<br/>titled position with the school, something like Honorary Resident<br/>Something-or-other. He lives in the North County coastal area of SD, and<br/>will be making somewhat regular appearance, seminars, and the like. He will<br/>*not*, I am sure, be anything like a regular faculty.</p><p>If any of you wants detailed info on the Shankar situation, I have become<br/>friends and colleagues with one of the percussionists at UCSD who also<br/>happens to have been an accompanist to Shankar on a couple of occasions at<br/>the school, and I can get more info from him. BTW, he (my percussion buddy)<br/>is just finishing his doctorate in the next couple of weeks, and is without<br/>a doubt one of the most amazing, well-rounded and profound musicians I have<br/>ever met (not to mention in his mid-30&apos;s). He, all by himself, pretty much<br/>blows to hell any all-encompassing theories on formal education vs. knowing<br/>which end is up...</p><p>[for those some of you who spent time at UCSD in your &apos;formative&apos; years<br/>(you know who you are), the dept. is in quite a bit of chaos these days,<br/>torn between different factions, generational tides, and disciplines<br/>(mostly comp. vs. performing) -- the road will be bumpy for a while before<br/>it can get back to being one of the bright spots...]</p><p>Sheesh, enough of me.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>..... . . . . . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . .....<br/>Jonathan M.
