I have a mono recording I made off a birthday<br/>&gt;broadcast - All I can hear is the installation, La Monte singing<br/>&gt;and an occasional trombone. I really wish I could have been in the room.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m sure with the advent of the DVD format, the entire piece could be put<br/>onto a DVD disc. And the same thing goes for the well tuned piano, and the<br/>Theatre of Eternal Music Big Band (which in fact sounds like it is very<br/>interesting).</p><p>DVD could be the savior of musical compositions of over an hour and much<br/>more.</p><p>Jeff Collins</p></div>
