It is still in low phases of development, but it is<br/>pretty operational right now.  It generates only a csound score currently,<br/>but I may add a MIDI capability.  Unfortunately, I am low on documentation<br/>skills, but I think you will be able to get around at least.  Check out<br/><a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/~pblasser/rocky.html">www.oberlin.edu/~pblasser/rocky.html</a>.  The website is still unofficial, so<br/>some links may not work, but if you want, you should also check out my<br/>albums.  Every one uses an alternative tuning or the another, and there is<br/>a pretty large amount of real audio files.</p><p>-Peter</p></div>
