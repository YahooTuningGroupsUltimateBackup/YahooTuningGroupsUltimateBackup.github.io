So why call it a<br/>dissonance?  It&apos;s a matter of context.  In two part counterpoint, a fourth<br/>is still treated as a suspension that needs to be resolved.  But I&apos;m sure<br/>you&apos;ll agree that perfect fourths can be quite consonant.</p><p>In context of an o/utonal definition of consonance, ASSes are dissonances,<br/>so you could always say they have to be resolved.  As I showed before, you<br/>can use them as suspended dissonances between an o/utonal pair.  If they<br/>don&apos;t sound dissonant, they&apos;re anomalies, as the name suggests.</p><p>You could even define all saturated 9-limit chords to be dissonances that<br/>have to resolve onto 5-limit consonances.  That&apos;s pretty much the way<br/>traditional harmony works.</p><p>One other idea, though.  We have three kinds of n-limit chords:<br/>otonalities, utonalities and the anomalous cases.  So why not call the<br/>latter anomalous-tonalities, or atonalities?  That would tie in with them<br/>not including the 1/1.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=32850 href="#32850">ðŸ”—</a>clumma &#x3C;carl@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/16/2002 12:09:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;See... a &quot;suspension&quot; implies &quot;resolution...&quot;  That&apos;s why a<br/>&gt;&gt;different name has to come up for the ASSes.</p><p>That&apos;s true -- I said the same thing in a much more confusing<br/>way eariler.
