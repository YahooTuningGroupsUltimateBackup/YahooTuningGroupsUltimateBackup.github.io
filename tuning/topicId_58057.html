There are many theoretical treatises but very<br/>&gt;few tell you how to tune a harpsichord (which needs retuning almost<br/>&gt;every day) by ear or with the minimum of other equipment. Naturally<br/>&gt;I do not mean electronic equipment, only what would be readily<br/>&gt;available in the 17th or 18th century.</p><p>Yes, and in fact there has been some debate (a great deal,<br/>actually) around here as to whether some of the theoretical<br/>tunings from this period *could* have even been tuned with<br/>the math and tools available at the time.</p><p>&gt;19th century and modern works mention beating, but we have to<br/>&gt;remember that the fact that a standard A is 440 Hz was not<br/>&gt;discovered until the mid 19th century, and the number of beats<br/>&gt;per second in meantone tunings is constantly varying depending<br/>&gt;on which fifth or third is being tuned.</p><p>Actually, this is also the case in equal temperament -- equal<br/>intervals (on different roots) do not beat equally!  In fact,<br/>there has been some debate here about whether the same German<br/>term was used for both equal-beating tuning and equal temperament,<br/>and if it meant the German theorists did not know the difference.</p><p>&gt;Any thoughts on how to bridge the gap between precise historical<br/>&gt;theory and everyday historical practice?</p><p>It&apos;s not my area of expertise, but you might try searching<br/>the archives.  Yahoo&apos;s search is tedious to use, but it does<br/>work (sort of).  You can also try a site-specific google<br/>search (add &quot;site:groups.yahoo.com&quot; to the end of your query)<br/>if your query (say, Werckmeister) is likely only to occur<br/>here out of all the yahoo groups.  Finally, you can try<br/>Robert Walker&apos;s archives, which I can&apos;t locate at the moment.<br/>Maybe he&apos;ll chime in.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
