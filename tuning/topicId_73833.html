Within each circle,<br/>eight fifths (F-C#) are tempered in Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma (695.81<br/>cents), while the other four are tempered equally wide (708.38<br/>cents). The two circles are placed at a distance equal to the<br/>enharmonic diesis of 2/7-comma (50.28 cents). Note that many of the<br/>intervals are identical to those of a regular 24-note version of<br/>Zarlino&apos;s meantone, but others are different because of the irregular<br/>temperament to close each circle.</p><p>Here are the links, followed by a Scala file of this circulating<br/>system:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/InHoraObservationis.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/InHoraObservationis.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/OElsa.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/OElsa.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Baran-GiftOfRain.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Baran-GiftOfRain.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/LaPacifica.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/LaPacifica.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-lattice.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-lattice.txt</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-septendecene.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-septendecene.txt</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-RastBayyati.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest24-RastBayyati.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>! zest24.scl<br/>!<br/>Zarlino Extraordinaire Spectrum Temperament (two circles at ~50.28c apart)<br/> 24<br/>!<br/> 50.27584<br/> 25/24<br/> 120.94826<br/> 191.62069<br/> 241.89653<br/> 287.43104<br/> 337.70688<br/> 383.24139<br/> 433.51722<br/> 504.18965<br/> 554.46549<br/> 574.86208<br/> 625.13792<br/> 695.81035<br/> 746.08619<br/> 779.05173<br/> 829.32757<br/> 887.43104<br/> 937.70688<br/> 995.81035<br/> 1046.08619<br/> 1079.05173<br/> 48/25<br/> 2/1</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@calweb.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2007 3:53:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, everyone.</p><p>Many thanks to Dave Keenan for his list of metastable intervals. I<br/>thought that I might see how many these are available in the Zest-24<br/>system. Everything here follows his list, except that I&apos;ve added a<br/>&quot;narrow supermajor sixth&quot; at 923 cents. Also, I might term the<br/>interval at 448c as both a &quot;wide supermajor 3rd&quot; and &quot;narrow sub-4th,<br/>but will here follow Dave&apos;s table.</p><p>If the nearest equivalent to one of these metastable intervals in<br/>Zest-24 is more than about four cents from the Phi-mediant value, then<br/>I have used brackets to emphasize this degree of variation. As we<br/>point out in our paper, a Phi-mediant is not a precise point where we<br/>expect something &quot;special&quot; to happen, but rather a guide to the region<br/>of a plateau of complexity. However, I tend to assume that a<br/>difference of five cents or more could cause a more appreciable change<br/>in shading or color, and therefore is worthy of an alert to readers.</p><p>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>      Limit of       Cents  Description           Zest-24  locations<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   5:6 6:7 11:13 ... 284c  wide subminor 3rd        287c      4<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   4:5 5:6 9:11  ... 339c  narrow neutral 3rd       338c      2<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   4:5 7:9 11:14 ... 422c  narrow supermajor 3rd    421c      4<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   3:4 7:9 10:13 ... 448c  narrow sub-4th           446c      2<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   3:4 5:7 8:11  ... 560c  wide super-4th           562c      2<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   2:3 5:7 7:10  ... 607c  narrow diminished 5th   [613c]    [4]<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   2:3 5:8 7:11  ... 792c  narrow minor 6th         792c      4<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   3:5 5:8 8:13  ... 833c  narrow neutral 6th       829c      2<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   3:5 7:12 10:17... 923c  narrow supermajor 6th    925c      4<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   3:5 4:7 7:12  ... 943c  narrow subminor 7th or   946c      2<br/>                           wide supermajor 6th<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   4:7 5:9 9:16  ... 1002c minor 7th              [1008c]   [14]<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   3:7 4:9 7:16  ... 1424c narrow supermajor 9th   1425c      2<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   2:5 3:7 5:12  ... 1503c narrow minor 10th       1500c      4<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   2:5 3:8 5:13  ... 1666c sub-11th               [1671c]    [2]<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   1:3 3:8 4:11  ... 1735c narrow super-11th       1737c      2<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   1:3 3:10 4:13 ... 2055c neutral 13th            2054c      2<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   2:7 3:10 5:17 ... 2109c wide major 13th or      2113c      4<br/>                           narrow supermajor 13th<br/>   ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   2:7 3:11 5:18 ... 2226c narrow neutral 14th     2229c      4<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@calweb.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2007 4:25:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, everyone.</p><p>Please let me warmly take note of recent discussions on meantone<br/>and related topics, which have lent me impetus to consider some<br/>questions of &quot;modal color&quot; in the Renaissance and Manneristic<br/>eras. As is very aptly observed in that thread, remote modal<br/>transpositions involving &quot;unusual&quot; intervals around 1600 or<br/>a bit later are very relevant to the question of &quot;key character&quot;<br/>traditions of a later era oriented to a major/minor system.</p><p>For anyone seeking an understanding of meantone aesthetics, both<br/>historical and modern, I would warmly recommend the writings of Doug<br/>Leedy, which combine much erudition, fine musical judgement, and<br/>eloquent advocacy.</p><p>While my main focus is on the late 15th to early 17th century, it<br/>is fascinating how modal and tonal concepts interact in what might<br/>be called the early tonal epoch around 1670-1730. Joel Lester&apos;s<br/>book _Between Modes and Keys_ is a fascinating survey of the<br/>situation in German from around 1592 to the mid-18th century.<br/>The French literature around 1700 concerning &quot;transposed modes&quot;<br/>that I mention below is intriguing, as are the modal organ<br/>compositions of Chaumont (1695) for a temperament ordinaire<br/>with nine regular and three wide fifths. Tempering the major<br/>thirds slightly wide, with the regular fifths at around 1/5-comma<br/>or 2/9-comma, would make the system circulate (i.e. no Wolf fifth).</p><p>A concern is that possibly I have written less of a coherent essay or<br/>presentation than a table of contents for a treatise &lt;grin&gt;. Maybe the<br/>best remedy is to say, early and often: &quot;Please feel free to jump in<br/>and ask questions or make comments at any point.&quot;</p><p>                 *          *         *</p><p>To me, the &quot;meantone era&quot; means especially the period from around 1450<br/>to 1670 when this style of tuning (regular or sometimes modified)<br/>nicely fit a style of modal polyphony based on a tertian ideal of<br/>sonority (established by the 1520&apos;s or so), and also with many<br/>characteristic accidental inflections often borrowed from the very<br/>sophisticated medieval technique of the 14th century where the<br/>complete trine (2:3:4) is the complete stable sonority.</p><p>However, I realize that meantone retained an important role in the<br/>early tonal era (say 1670-1750), and indeed beyond, even as<br/>circulating well-temperaments gained in popularity.</p><p>For me, the modal meantone era is a panorama of practices, a time when<br/>traditional medieval patterns and concepts like intensive and<br/>remissive cadences, and routine inflections, get used in new ways, and<br/>sometimes reshaped to fit the new aesthetic of pervasive tertian<br/>sonority, with subtly controlled shades of tension, as opposed to the<br/>older dynamic contrast of stability and bold instability.</p><p>Thus the question of &quot;modal color&quot; can be an intricate one, because we<br/>must consider not only the process of transposing the regular notes of<br/>a mode, and the fluid nature of B/Bb, but also the routine or<br/>sometimes not-so-routine inflections required to form intensive or<br/>remissive cadences on various steps of a mode. This modal situation is<br/>somewhat analogous to that of Near Eastern maqam and dastgah<br/>traditions, where likewise certain accustomed inflections are part of<br/>the routine &quot;procedure&quot; of a mode, nicely expressed by the Arabic<br/>_sayr_ or Turkish _seyir_, i.e. the &quot;path&quot; followed the music.</p><p>Here we have a kaleidoscopic picture, in part captured by known<br/>compositions themselves, in part reported by theorists (often of<br/>diverse tastes and opinions!), and in part very imperfectly inferred<br/>from this incomplete evidence. Why don&apos;t I outline a few points for<br/>discussions, and eagerly invite anyone reading to seek clarification<br/>of not-so-transparent points or definitions of unfamiliar terms and<br/>concepts:</p><p>       (1) Interestingly, the &quot;standard&quot; accidentals of Eb, Bb,<br/>           F#, C#, and G# seem common to much 14th-century and<br/>           16th-century music, in part because both periods tend<br/>           to use the same manners of cadencing, intensive or<br/>           remissive. on the same steps. Thus intensive cadences<br/>           with ascending semitones are common on F, C, G, D, and A;<br/>           and remissive semitones with descending semitones on E,<br/>           A, and sometimes D. In 1350 or 1550, a 12-note keyboard<br/>           tuning of Eb-G# nicely serves this system of modes or<br/>           octave-species and inflections -- albeit Pythagorean<br/>           in the earlier period and meantone in the latter.</p><p>       (2) In the trinic focality of the 14th century, where the<br/>           restful and conclusive goal is a complete 2:3:4 trine<br/>           on the final of a mode or octave-species (e.g. D-A-D),<br/>           inflections serve mainly to alter unstable intervals<br/>           so as to make them &quot;more closely approach&quot; their stable<br/>           goals: for example, minor third before unison, major<br/>           third before fifth, major sixth before octave. Thus we<br/>           have intensive (E-G#-C# before D-A-D), or remissive<br/>           (Bb-D-G before A-E-A) manners. Many of these progressions<br/>           play a role in guiding the tertian textures of the 16th<br/>           century also, as does the intensive/remissive contrast,<br/>           noted by Tomas de Santa Maria in his treatise of 1565<br/>           on keyboard counterpoint and harmony. Of course, this<br/>           intensive/remissive theme of late medieval focality<br/>           takes new shapes in the meantone era.</p><p>       (3) Additionally, by the 1520&apos;s, 16th-century technique<br/>           demands the regular use of accidentals to obtain<br/>           major thirds or tenths above the lowest voice of<br/>           sonorities of repose, as at final and also internal<br/>           cadences. This is one very strong reason for<br/>           adapting Eb-G# rather than Ab-C# as a usual 12-note<br/>           meantone: we need the major third E-G# for a close<br/>           in E Phrygian including the third. A love of what<br/>           Zarlino will describe as the harmonic division of<br/>           the fifth with the major third below the minor,<br/>           in frequency ratios 4:5:6, will invite many colorful<br/>           effects and inflections, including some forms of<br/>           direct chromaticism.</p><p>       (4) One school of 16th-century and early 17th-century<br/>           thought is that ideally, at least, one should strive<br/>           to maintain smooth and &quot;correct&quot; meantone intonation<br/>           either by avoiding remote transpositions which will<br/>           place modes and especially their characteristic<br/>           cadences where the regular steps and inflections<br/>           will not be available on a given fixed-pitch<br/>           instrument; or, using an extended instrument<br/>           (anything from 13-16 to 31 notes) that will provide<br/>           those remote steps and accidentals in their usual<br/>           proportions. This is the view of Zarlino (1558), who<br/>           cautions that people writing modal transpositions<br/>           should consider the intended instrument or ensemble<br/>           and its possible limitations (not applying to singers,<br/>           of course). Praetorius, 60 years later, urges that<br/>           a meantone keyboard (1/4-comma) with 19 notes will<br/>           make available correct thirds such as F-Ab which are<br/>           missing on 12-note instruments in a usual Eb-G#.</p><p>       (5) Another approach is to modify a 12-note tuning so<br/>           as to accommodate at least some locations where one<br/>           may be especially tempted to extend the system,<br/>           for example G#/Ab and/or Eb/D#. This approach is<br/>           documented as early as 1511 by Arnold Schlick, indeed<br/>           in the first practical guide on how to tune a keyboard<br/>           instrument (more specifically the organ) in a meantone<br/>           style of temperament. In Schlick&apos;s system, Ab is<br/>           somewhat compromised so as to serve as a tolerable<br/>           G# in ornamented intensive cadences on A. Praetorius<br/>           describes a similar compromise in 1618, a bit more<br/>           than a century later; and at the end of the 17th<br/>           century, Werckmeister exhorts those still enamoured<br/>           with the &quot;Praetorian temperament&quot; (i.e. 1/4-comma)<br/>           to at least consider this kind of finessing for<br/>           Eb/D#, for example.</p><p>       (6) While authors such as Ramos (1482) and Denis (1643,<br/>           1650) emphasize that one must not play &quot;bad&quot; meantone<br/>           intervals, for example augmented seconds or diminished<br/>           fourths in place of regular thirds, others such as<br/>           Lanfranco (1533) tell us that C# and F#, for example,<br/>           are sometimes used as Db and Gb. This might imply<br/>           either the frank acceptance of some of the intervals<br/>           that Ramos and Denis warn us against, or a subtle<br/>           &quot;mollification&quot; of these intervals through a bit of<br/>           finessing (see point 5 above).</p><p>       (7) Around 1700, the French literature speaks of<br/>           &quot;transposed modes&quot; in the sense of those involving<br/>           unusual intervals in a regular or modified meantone<br/>           tuning, and reports that some musicians find them<br/>           all the rage; the keyboard music of Couperin, as<br/>           analyzed by Lindley as neatly fitting a temperament<br/>           ordinaire, accords well with such observations.<br/>           While by this point we are moving into the realm<br/>           of early tonality, such a taste for unusual<br/>           intervals might also fit the sensibilities of late<br/>           Manneristic modality around 1600, along with the use<br/>           of new dissonances and chromatic idioms.</p><p>       (8) In the performance on keyboard of a written<br/>           composition, unusual meantone intervals may occur<br/>           either if they are expressly written (e.g. D-Bb-F#<br/>           or E-G#-C), as may occur in conventional as well as<br/>           &quot;experimental&quot; 16th-century styles; or if sonorities<br/>           with regular spellings are performed with accidental<br/>           substitutions (e.g. written B-B-D#-F for an intensive<br/>           cadence to E realized B-B-Eb-F; written Ab-C-F-C for<br/>           a remissive cadence to G realized G#-C-F-C). How<br/>           often might performers accept the latter situation,<br/>           or possibly even relish its colorful consequences?<br/>           Lindley suggests that composers might sometimes<br/>           anticipate such a situation by writing D# to form<br/>           an intensive cadence on E, for example, but with<br/>           ornamentation to soften the vertical impact -- much<br/>           as Schlick had done with G# in his organ composing<br/>           when making an intensive cadence on A.</p><p>       (9) From a modern xenharmonic perspective, neomedieval<br/>           or otherwise, the septimal approximations produced<br/>           by unusual meantone spellings can be a special<br/>           attraction. However, we should be aware that while<br/>           some musicians of the period such as Fabio Colonna<br/>           loved a range of unusual intervals and intonations,<br/>           a specific taste for septimal ratios and intervals<br/>           as an asset of meantone may first be articulated<br/>           by Huygens (1691) in his famous essay on the new<br/>           31-note harmonic cycle. It is a signal for due<br/>           caution when Vicentino (1555) finds the augmented<br/>           second or &quot;minimal third&quot; likely near 7:6 (in a<br/>           circulating 31-note 1/4-comma or 31-EDO) to tend<br/>           toward dissonance, and the augmented sixth likely<br/>           close to 7:4 as also on the dissonant side -- in<br/>           contrast to the neutral or &quot;proximate minor&quot; third<br/>           which he states is close to 11:9, and finds rather<br/>           concordant. Taking into account both Vicentino<br/>           and Huygens leaves open the possibility that<br/>           tastes might vary at any point in time.</p><p>      (10) Looking at this situation from a 21st-century<br/>           perspective, we may be influenced in our view<br/>           of the meantone era by a familiarity with either<br/>           the earlier medieval or later tonal practice,<br/>           not to mention elements of other world musics.<br/>           It is fascinating to try and sort out both the<br/>           historical evidence as to the sonorous worlds<br/>           that may have obtained during this engaging<br/>           era, and our own &quot;alternative histories&quot; that<br/>           may be inspired by this era at once luminous<br/>           and nebulous.</p><p>Again, I welcome questions, comments, or requests for clarification on<br/>any of these maybe not-so-easily comprehensible points, a great help<br/>for me in trying to state things more coherently.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@calweb.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2007 1:37:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Re: Metastable Intervals and Tenney Complexity<br/>   --- In [34]tuning@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>   &gt; &gt; I find these intervals (among others) to fulfill my<br/>   &gt; &gt; requirements for non-Just, non-equal intervals with<br/>   &gt; &gt; a characteristic sound and internal cohesiveness/integrity<br/>   &gt; &gt; of their own- and I find them strangely &quot;consonant&quot;.<br/>   &gt;<br/>   &gt; Well, we might have to agree not to call them &quot;consonant&quot; as such, as<br/>   &gt; this could cause a lot of confusion, but they seem to have<br/>   &gt; _something_, as Erv Wilson agrees.</p><p>   &gt; I&apos;ve also been calling these and some other intervals &quot;distant&quot;<br/>   &gt; or &quot;soft&quot; consonances.

The point about<br/>the contrast between pure major thirds and slightly impure minor ones<br/>in 1/4-comma is something Mark Lindley suggests could add special<br/>interest to passages in parallel thirds.</p><p>As for 2/7-comma, which I mostly seem to be using in a modified form<br/>(regular in the range of F-C#), I would agree with Lindley that it may<br/>be ideal for rather moderately paced music, and also for music putting<br/>a good deal of emphasis on modes favoring the arithmetic division of<br/>the fifth where the minor third is placed below the major.</p><p>The big point about meantone I might emphasize, as does Jean Denis in<br/>his treatise in the editions of 1643 and 1650, is the inequality of<br/>the diatonic and chromatic semitones: 117/76 in 1/4-comma, and 121/71<br/>in 2/7 comma. Even when no &quot;special&quot; intervals or direct chromatic<br/>steps are used, as in a beautiful piece of Viadana I much enjoy, the<br/>routine juxtaposition of different inflections of a step (e.g. F#/F)<br/>can make this &quot;enharmonic difference,&quot; as I recall Dave Keenan calls<br/>it, vital.</p><p>For me, and also Denis, the difference in semitone sizes is of central<br/>importance. Reacting to people who wanted keyboards tuned equally<br/>(i.e. in 12-EDO), like the lute Denis said that rather this people<br/>might better use their ingenuity to improve the tuning of the lute by<br/>giving it proper major and minor semitones like the organ or<br/>harpsichord!</p><p>Easley Blackwood also makes this point: meantone chromaticism has the<br/>special charm of those dramatically unequal semitones, which just doesn&apos;t<br/>translate into a 12-EDO rendition.</p><p>Johnny, I certainly agree that we shouldn&apos;t neglect irregular<br/>temperaments other than &quot;circulating well-temperaments.&quot; Lindley, for<br/>example, emphasizes that Schlick&apos;s temperament would have had at least<br/>what I&apos;d call a &quot;semi-Wolf&quot; at C#-G#/Ab, about 8-10 cents wide, and<br/>which Schlick himself urges we avoid. Finessing only one or two notes<br/>in 1/4-comma like G#/Ab or Eb/D#, as described by Praetorius and<br/>advocated by Werckmeister for those not interested in a circulating<br/>well-temperament, would be unlikely to repair the Wolf fifth, although<br/>it might alleviate it a bit, say to something like 1/6-comma.</p><p>The Grammateus temperament is a bit different, because that is<br/>primarily based on Pythagorean tuning with diatonic whole tones<br/>divided into two equal semitones -- that is, each equal to 9:8^(1/2),<br/>or about 101.955 cents (e.g. F-F#-G); E-F and B-C are the<br/>usual 256:243 or 90.224 cents. Jorgensen considers this as circulating,<br/>with two fifths at 1/2 Pythagorean comma narrow, or just on the verge<br/>of being Wolves by this definition. Maybe, like Schlick&apos;s, it could be<br/>called &quot;semi-circulating&quot; -- but not necessarily by intent, as far as I<br/>know. Dowland&apos;s irregular lute tuning is also interesting, and that has<br/>at least one Wolf fifth, as I recall.</p><p>A final point I&apos;d like to clarify is that 31 notes per octave in<br/>1/4-comma is a very nice circulating system, much like 31-EDO, with<br/>the subtle difference that some intervals will differ in size by about<br/>6.07 cents, the difference between 18 pure octave and 31 1/4-comma<br/>fifths. This variation will affect only a few major and minor thirds,<br/>and is, of course, milder than that typically found even in quite<br/>subtle 12-note well-temperaments.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@calweb.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2007 1:52:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Shaahin,</p><p>Please let me suggest that if you are looking for a tetrachord<br/>covering a tritone of some kind, the European Lydian mode might be one<br/>example.

The strange spot around 284<br/>&gt; cents, by the way, coincides with 33:28 (284.447 cents), for whatever<br/>&gt; reason.

By the way, I wonder if maybe,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; in the harmonic entropy kind of context, we might want a term<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; like &quot;assonance&quot; (that came up once, I seem to recall, in a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; discussion where Heinz Bohlen was involved) or even &quot;isonance,&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the latter meaning a kind of uniform or pervasive<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; non-coincidence of partials described by Professor Temes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Isophones&quot; sounds very suitable, though I was thinking of the<br/>&gt; &gt; same term for those skiaharmonic series consisting of harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; means. To be most correct, maximally inharmonic intervals would<br/>&gt; &gt; be truly &quot;xenharmonic&quot;- xenophones. I don&apos;t find that the maxima<br/>&gt; &gt; of harmonic entropy to be &quot;the&quot; yardstick, or &quot;justify&quot; intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; because they&apos;re found by HE, rather, the reverse, for the HE<br/>&gt; &gt; charts I have seen have a number of intervals I found by far<br/>&gt; &gt; simpler means.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Considering this, I&apos;d agree that &quot;isophones&quot; or &quot;isonance&quot; runs into a<br/>&gt; possible confusion with isoharmonic sonorities or chords, which have a<br/>&gt; ery clear and accepted meaning (e.g. 7:9:11:13). However, your<br/>&gt; &quot;xenophones,&quot; or maybe xenonances, looks perfect. These nobly intoned<br/>&gt; (NI) intervals, as Dave has named them, are indeed &quot;strange&quot; ones at<br/>&gt; ratios maximally distant by at least one possible mathematical measure<br/>&gt; from the familiar realm of simple ratios with coinciding partials.<br/>&gt; What I like about &quot;xenonance&quot; is that it tells us that this is<br/>&gt; definitely something different, but doesn&apos;t impose any viewpoint as to<br/>&gt; just how we should hear it -- as concord, discord, or something else.<br/>&gt; It also has a pleasant association with the &quot;xentonality&quot; of Bill<br/>&gt; Sethares.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; With many thanks<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; , rather, thank you, Margot!

I realize that,<br/>if you&apos;re so inclined, we could be in for a long conversation, and<br/>will try to follow your points step by step.</p><p>&gt;   Margo: Lindley, forexample, emphasizes that Schlick&apos;s temperament<br/>&gt;   would have had at least what I&apos;d call a &quot;semi-Wolf&quot; at C#-G#/Ab,<br/>&gt;   about 8-10 cents wide, and which Schlick himself urges we avoid.</p><p>&gt;   Johnny: It seems that there is a standard irregular tuning family,<br/>&gt;   much like the meantone family.  They commonly have 20 major and<br/>&gt;   minor keys (such as with Fischer).  This indicates there are 2<br/>&gt;   &quot;semi-wolves&quot; as you call them.</p><p>May I assume that &quot;keys&quot; here means simply the number of locations in<br/>a tuning with a fifth plus a major or minor third of an acceptable<br/>size for a given style? What I&apos;d like to do is to look at Schlick from<br/>a few stylistic angles, including Schlick&apos;s as far as we can tell, in<br/>a way that might address some of the issues of the counting process.<br/>I must admit I don&apos;t know what Fischer&apos;s temperament from the Bach era<br/>is, but I&apos;m very interested to learn. Why don&apos;t I give a Scala file<br/>for one reading of Schlick (1511), based largely on Lindley&apos;s analysis:</p><p>! schlick_1511.scl<br/>!<br/>One reading of Arnold Schlick&apos;s modified meantone (1511)<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 88.27000<br/> 196.09000<br/> 303.91000<br/> 392.18000<br/> 501.95500<br/> 589.24750<br/> 698.04500<br/> 799.02250<br/> 894.13500<br/> 1002.93250<br/> 1090.22500<br/> 2/1</p><p>First, let&apos;s consider the fifths: 11 locations have fifths within<br/>about 5 cents of pure, with C#/Ab as the semi-Wolf or &quot;dog&quot; at about<br/>8-10 cents wide according to Lindley. In a medieval style, where major<br/>and minor thirds are unstable and flexible in their tuning, and thus<br/>not an essential element in defining a stable polyphonic center, we<br/>have 11 locations for transposing any desired mode -- as long as that<br/>pesky &quot;dog fifth&quot; doesn&apos;t &quot;bark&quot; on a degree where we need a stable<br/>fifth, like the confinal or reciting tone. Actually that canine might<br/>be very exciting and charming if it occurs between two upper voices in<br/>the unstable sonority E-G#/Ab-C# leading to a cadence on D-A-D!<br/>Indeed, Lindley says (and I agree) that in this kind of medieval<br/>cadence, the upper fourth of that unstable sixth sonority might be<br/>impure by a full Pythagorean comma!</p><p>However, for medieval or neomedieval purposes where &quot;circulation&quot;<br/>means simply that all 12 fifths are within maybe 7 cents or so of pure<br/>(as in 19-EDO, or 22-EDO with tempering in the opposite direction),<br/>it&apos;s easy to achieve full circulation simply by lowering Ab/G# about<br/>two or three cents, so that Ab-C and E-G# are about equally impure,<br/>each somewhere 404 cents. This doesn&apos;t have to be precise, and here<br/>I&apos;ve simply picked one possibility that still favors Ab-C a bit:</p><p>! Schlick1511_variation.scl<br/>!<br/>Variation on Schlick (1511), all 5ths within 7c of pure<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 88.27000<br/> 196.09000<br/> 303.91000<br/> 392.18000<br/> 501.95500<br/> 589.24750<br/> 698.04500<br/> 797.00000<br/> 894.13500<br/> 1002.93250<br/> 1090.22500<br/> 2/1</p><p>Now let&apos;s go back to Schlick&apos;s temperament itself, viewing it from his<br/>own stylistic perspective in an early 16th-century context. Now thirds<br/>as well as fifths become factors in defining a good modal center. By<br/>Schlick&apos;s own criteria, we have 8 locations with reasonably agreeable<br/>major thirds, Ab-C less smooth than the others but still acceptable<br/>for sustained use (maybe around 12-EDO size).</p><p>At around Pythagorean, E-G# is unstable but tolerable for use in<br/>ornamented intensive cadences to A (with an ascending semitone G#-A);<br/>B-Eb, F#-Bb, and C#-F are like typical meantone diminished fourths,<br/>here maybe 413 cents or so, in the zone Secor has discussed between<br/>Pythagorean and the region of 14:11 (418 cents) or a tad wider where<br/>listeners might still hear some semblance of relatedness to 5:4 in<br/>styles where it is the ideal. Writing in a 16th-century context, not<br/>surprisingly, Schlick tells us that they are &quot;little esteemed and<br/>seldom used&quot; -- but maybe also, one is tempted to guess, not<br/>categorically excluded, at least for the more adventurous transposers<br/>whom certain theorists either mention without reproach (Lanfranco<br/>1533) or passionately warn us against (Denis 1643, 1650).</p><p>Thus we have 11 stable fifths, and 8 stable centers for modes<br/>featuring major thirds above the final (Lydian, Ionian, Mixolydian) --<br/>assuming that the C#-Ab/G# &quot;dog&quot; or those 4 major thirds at<br/>Pythagorean or larger don&apos;t disrupt other steps where we need stable<br/>tertian sonorities. How about modes with minor thirds above the final<br/>(Dorian, Aeolian, Phrygian)?</p><p>Here things are more problematic, because we don&apos;t know Schlick&apos;s<br/>criteria for minor thirds. If we embrace one modern view that the<br/>tuning of these intervals is very flexible -- like major thirds also<br/>in a medieval rather than Renaissance/Manneristic context -- with<br/>anything from around 7:6 to 6:5 acceptable, then we have potentially<br/>11 locations for these modes, everything except for C# with that dog<br/>fifth. Again, once we consider other steps of the mode and cadences,<br/>it will get more complicated.</p><p>If we instead say that a minor third shouldn&apos;t be &quot;substantially&quot;<br/>smaller than Pythagorean, based on theorists who outright reject<br/>meantone augmented seconds used as normal minor thirds (e.g. Denis),<br/>or at least urge great caution (e.g. Vicentino, 1555), then we have 8<br/>such minor thirds at locations with acceptable fifths, here including<br/>Ab/G#-B-Eb with the minor third at around 291 cents, or three cents<br/>narrow of Pythagorean. This leaves Eb-F# and Bb-C# at 285 cents or so,<br/>outside the range of musical interchangeability under this criterion.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting to ask how a composer like Josquin might take to<br/>playing something like his beautiful _Mille regretz_ in Eb Phrygian<br/>with the third above the final Eb-F# at around 285 cents. Would it<br/>sound too far from the new meantone ideal -- or possibly quite<br/>congenial to the older Pythagorean tradition still in evidence around<br/>1500, where it could add to the melancholy quality of the piece: a<br/>touch of &quot;modal color&quot; analogous to the key color that French writers<br/>about 200 years later describe for very small minor thirds in a<br/>temperament ordinaire?</p><p>Unfortunately, Eb Phrygian becomes rather academic because of that<br/>pesky dog fifth on C#, the step below the final, although that step is<br/>less prominent than in lots of Phrygian settings. If we&apos;re going to<br/>try it, I&apos;d say let&apos;s lower Ab/G# a bit as in my variation, which<br/>wouldn&apos;t affect the size of Eb-F# or Bb-C#, our smallest minor thirds.</p><p>My point is that counting acceptable modal or tonal centers can be<br/>very sensitive to what people are assuming is &quot;acceptable,&quot; and also<br/>that having &quot;8 locations with an acceptable major third and fifth; and<br/>9 with an acceptable minor third and fifth&quot; is only the first step in<br/>deciding how many of those locations would also accommodate the<br/>confinals, usual internal cadences, and so forth for a typical piece<br/>in Dorian, say.</p><p>Let&apos;s illustrate this moving ahead a bit in the 16th century, to the<br/>1520&apos;s and later. How about untransposed E Phrygian, or A Dorian for<br/>that matter? With either, we encounter a very basic problem: a closing<br/>sonority with a third above the final -- or likewise a sectional close<br/>on some other step of the mode -- is by this point expected to be<br/>major, by inflection if necessary. A Pythagorean E-G# thus makes an<br/>up-to-date Phrygian untenable, and likewise modes like A Dorian which<br/>often have internal cadences on E (here the confinal).</p><p>Anyway, as far as the fifths go, there&apos;s only one &quot;semi-Wolf&quot; in<br/>Schlick&apos;s temperament, C#-Ab/G#. It&apos;s a situation where we have a<br/>harmonic excess from the 11 notes or 10 fifths Eb-C#, with the six<br/>diatonic fifths F-B maybe around 1/5-comma and the other four around<br/>1/6-comma according to Lindley, of something like 12 cents. The<br/>&quot;finessing&quot; involves the single note Ab/G#, with Schlick evidently<br/>making Ab-Eb about 2-4 cents wide (thus comparable to some of the<br/>narrow fifths), and leaving 8-10 cents for our C#-Ab/G# &quot;dog.&quot; A<br/>division of this excess more like 5/7 cents or 6/6 cents would make<br/>all fifths fully circulating.</p><p>Again, I&apos;m very curious about the Fischer temperament and how it might<br/>compare to this one.</p><p>&gt;   I have seen the use of the term &quot;dog-fifths&quot; for these (for being<br/>&gt;   more tame than wolves...instead of howling, they merely bark).</p><p>Yes, I have seen someone, Bradley Lehman maybe, compare the Wolf in<br/>1/6-comma to a &quot;border collie.&quot; By the way, in discussing<br/>&quot;circulation,&quot; maybe it would be helpful to separate the wolves and<br/>dogs from the goats, so to speak.</p><p>My idea is to use the canicular terms for fifths somewhat more than<br/>1/3-comma from just: maybe &quot;dogs&quot; in the Schlick range of 8-10 cents;<br/>&quot;semi-Wolves&quot; around 1/2 comma or a bit more (Jorgensen goes as far as<br/>15 cents or so in certain circumstances); and outright Wolves beyond<br/>that.</p><p>In contrast, &quot;goats&quot; are thirds appreciably larger than Pythagorean<br/>(if major) or smaller (if minor). My inspiration for this is a French<br/>term, _ton de la chevre_ or &quot;goat tone or mode,&quot; evidently used by<br/>around 1700 to describe a transposition like C# Dorian or Aeolian<br/>(moving by this point into minor) with &quot;bleating&quot; major thirds in a<br/>regular or modified meantone. While the term might actually have<br/>originated to describe some kind of lute effect involving timbre<br/>rather than supra-Pythagorean major thirds, it came to describe a<br/>keyboard transposition with those extra-wide thirds.</p><p>Thus in a conventional well-temperament, the idea is to avoid both<br/>wolves or dogs and goats; in a &quot;fifth-circulating&quot; temperament, as I<br/>might call it, we might specifically seek to have meantone color over<br/>a bit more than half of the 12-note circle while making the remote<br/>region a peaceful pasture where goats may safely graze. The variation<br/>on Schlick that I describe would thus be a fifth-circulating<br/>temperament of the goat-friendly variety, but certainly _not_ a<br/>&quot;well-temperament&quot;!</p><p>&gt;  Margo: Finessing only one or two notes in 1/4-comma like G#/Ab or<br/>&gt;  Eb/D#, as described by Praetorius and advocated by Werckmeister for<br/>&gt;  those not interested in a circulating well-temperament, would be<br/>&gt;  unlikely to repair the Wolf fifth, although it might alleviate it a<br/>&gt;  bit, say to something like 1/6-comma.</p><p>&gt;  Johnny: I could not find this in Werckmeister&apos;s Musical<br/>&gt;  Temperament, which I have just typed out to put with a new book I<br/>&gt;  have written on Bach&apos;s tuning.  Do you recall where you saw this?</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure that it was in this article, only available via the<br/>Internet through a subscription but very likely still at my library:</p><p>   Bach&apos;s keyboard temperament<br/>   Internal evidence from the Well-Tempered Clavier<br/>   BARNES Early Music.1979; 7: 236-249</p><p>This is a very well-written article that considers the evidence in a<br/>calm and balanced way, and shows an appreciation for the fine points<br/>of unequal temperament. As I recall, the relevant passage (possibly<br/>from the Orgelprobe?, if not from the work you mention) occurs in a<br/>discussion where he mentions Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma, and shows that even<br/>1/7-comma will have a dog fifth, as we&apos;re calling it, so that the<br/>direction to circulation lies elsewhere. Then he describes how people<br/>who are wedded to the Praetorian temperament could still benefit from<br/>the concepts he is presenting by adjusting Eb (if I recall correctly)<br/>so that it is also usable as D# -- in other words, a very rudimentary<br/>temperament ordinaire. This is my recollection, at any rate. A trip to<br/>the library could clear this up, and I&apos;ll try to do it in the next day<br/>or two.</p><p>&gt;  Margo: The Grammateus temperament is a bit different, because that<br/>&gt;  is primarily based on Pythagorean tuning with diatonic whole tones<br/>&gt;  divided into two equal semitones -- that is, each equal to<br/>&gt;  9:8^(1/2), or about 101.955 cents (e.g. F-F#-G); E-F and B-C are<br/>&gt;  the usual 256:243 or 90.224 cents.</p><p>&gt;  Johnny: Doesn&apos;t it have 20 keys only like other irregular tuning?</p><p>The count of &quot;keys&quot; or locations, for a modal or tonal style, could<br/>depend on two main things.</p><p>First, we have 10 pure fifths plus two (Bb-F and B-F) impure by 1/2<br/>Pythagorean comma. For Jorgensen, a &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; is anything _more_<br/>impure than precisely this amount (11.73 cents) -- so these two make<br/>it just under the wire, and he considers it a circulating<br/>temperament.</p><p>Second, since all fifths are pure or narrow, we don&apos;t have any goat<br/>thirds to consider. For Jorgensen, a major third is serviceable if not<br/>significantly larger than Pythagorean, and a minor third at just about<br/>any size from around 7:6 to 6:5 -- so we have all 24 locations<br/>covered, 12 major and 12 minor thirds.</p><p>If we consider those semi-Wolves or dog-fifths too assertively barking<br/>to be stable, then we have 10 rather than 12 locations available as<br/>stable centers in a medieval type of context; as in lots of early<br/>15th-century music, the different shadings of unstable thirds will add<br/>lots of modal color, but are more or less freely interchangeable.</p><p>In part. Grammateus is offering a mathematical demonstration or<br/>&quot;amusing reckoning&quot; for the sheer intellectual joy of showing how a<br/>superparticular ratio like 9:8 can be equally divided by geometrical<br/>means. Musically, however, the tuning seems to me to fit with an early<br/>15th-century kind of outlook where the idea is to have a basically<br/>Pythagorean system, but with some schismatic or allied thirds deployed<br/>at certain strategic locations. In this view, fifth-circulation is not<br/>the point, but splitting the Wolf fifth into two parts to combine the<br/>remaining ten pure fifths with a larger number of &quot;mollified&quot; thirds<br/>including one of these two semi-Wolves in their chains. An English<br/>organ tuning of 1373 with an 18:17:16 division of diatonic whole tones<br/>(e.g. C-C#-D) in a generally Pythagorean scheme might address similar<br/>concerns, and would well comport with the penchant for 5-limit or<br/>nearby tunings of thirds shown in some strains of medieval English<br/>theory and practice, of which you have also spoken.</p><p>Putting the two semi-Wolves on steps a semitone apart (Bb-F, B-F#)<br/>means that no fewer than 8 of the 12 major thirds will be so tempered<br/>at about 396 cents, but creates a semi-Wolf at Bb-F which can create<br/>problems with lots of late medieval music. Relocating these fifths to<br/>locations like Eb-Bb and F#-C# (7 major thirds smaller than 400 cents)<br/>or F#-C# and G#-Eb (6 major thirds smaller than 400 cents) gives many<br/>of the same advantages with less disruption.</p><p>It is worth emphasizing that these variations, like the original<br/>Grammateus tuning, really belong more to the musical style current<br/>around 1400 rather than 1500, and do not address the needs of a style<br/>calling for some variety of meantone. The diatonic major thirds F-A,<br/>C-E, and G-B, for example, remain Pythagorean -- so that the system is<br/>not in the same musical category as Schlick&apos;s.</p><p>This said, we may note that the problem for someone wishing to make<br/>these systems fully fifth-circulating are quite different, also. With<br/>the Grammateus modified Pythagorean system, we face the problem that<br/>the Wolf simply cannot be shared between only two fifths while making<br/>both fifths less impure than 1/2 Pythagorean comma -- one or both must<br/>howl, or at least bark quite assertively! An equal division among<br/>three fifths could be marginally acceptable, with four fifths much<br/>better. The result would be akin to a well-temperament, but with pure<br/>fifths and Pythagorean thirds in the nearer part of the circle, and<br/>tempered fifths and smoother thirds in the more remote portion. This<br/>pattern fits with 15th-century Pythagorean variations rather than with<br/>either 16th-century meantone or an 18th-century well-temperament.</p><p>With Schlick, the harmonic excess is something on the order of<br/>about 12 cents, so it&apos;s easy to have both fifths within 7 cents or so<br/>of pure if that&apos;s the goal -- which it wasn&apos;t for Schlick, who<br/>evidently wanted to compromise Ab-C as little as possible while very<br/>partially taming the goat third at E-G#.</p><p>&gt;  Margo: Jorgensen considers this as circulating, with two fifths at<br/>&gt;  1/2 Pythagorean comma narrow, or just on the verge of being Wolves<br/>&gt;  by this definition.</p><p>&gt;   Johnny: While modern ears might enjoy a bark or even a howl, the<br/>&gt;   earliers (as opposed to the moderns) strictly avoided moving in<br/>&gt;   their territory.  And we are speaking of improvisation, as<br/>&gt;   composition strictly avoided the canine keys.  I must disagree<br/>&gt;   with Jorgensen; there is no circulating without a circle, and that<br/>&gt;   begins on paper with Werckmeister.</p><p>Here I&apos;d urge that we sort out the wolves and goats. On the canine<br/>side, I&apos;d agree that it&apos;s very unlikely that composers are going to<br/>cadence on a fifth which is assumed to be half a comma or more<br/>impure. If we see a fifth Ab-Eb, I&apos;d take that as a hint that the<br/>piece is intended for an instrument which actually has both notes!</p><p>There&apos;s an interesting partial exception that seems likely in the<br/>earlier 15th century, when we find keyboard pieces in places like the<br/>Buxheimer Organ Book with cadences like this:</p><p>                  B   C<br/>                  F#  G<br/>                  D   C</p><p>Totally routine -- until we note, as Lindley does, other stylistic<br/>indications that the piece is intended for a regular Pythagorean<br/>tuning with written sharps tuned as flats, Gb-B, so that the upper<br/>fourth F#-B, or actually the augmented third Gb-B, is wide by a full<br/>comma! However, given the consonances formed by both upper voices with<br/>the lowest one, and also the cadential context where we _expect_<br/>instability and excitement when major third and sixth expand to fifth<br/>and octave, he and I agree that it can be quite pleasing in practice.</p><p>Maybe that&apos;s the exception that proves the rule, as far as these<br/>canine fifths go. It might fit with the 14th-century observation of<br/>Johannes Boen (1357) that either an augmented or diminished fourth can<br/>become a &quot;consonance by circumstance&quot; (_consonantia per accidens_)<br/>when an appropriate third is placed below it (D-F-B or E-G#-C) -- and<br/>so, apparently, an early 15th-century Wolf fourth.</p><p>However, depending on the concept of &quot;circulation&quot; at issue, we could<br/>be talking about only wolves and dogs, or also goats. Here are two<br/>possible definitions I&apos;d consider relevant to this discussion:</p><p>                   -----------------<br/>                   Fifth-circulation<br/>                   -----------------</p><p>A 12-note tuning may be considered fifth-circulating if all 12 fifths<br/>are within about 1/3-comma or 7 cents of pure: major and minor thirds<br/>may be of any size as long as this condition is met. In a very<br/>colorful modified meantone, for example, they may often range from<br/>roughly 5-limit or pental to septimal: 5:4-9:7 and 7:6-6:5 for major<br/>and minor thirds respectively.</p><p>          -----------------------------------------<br/>          Tertian circulation or &quot;well-temperament&quot;<br/>          -----------------------------------------</p><p>A 12-note tuning may be considered tertian-circulating or<br/>well-tempered when these three conditions are all met:</p><p>     (1) The tuning meets the requirements for fifth-circulation,<br/>         with all 12 fifths no more than about 7 cents from just;</p><p>     (2) The diatonic major thirds F-A, C-E, and G-B are not<br/>         substantially further from a just 5:4 than the 400 cents of<br/>         12-EDO.</p><p>     (3) There are no &quot;goat&quot; major thirds substantially larger than<br/>         Pythagorean, with around 409-410 cents (say 19:15, used in a<br/>         temperament by Aaron Johnson) as a possible bounding region.</p><p>Getting fifth-circulation in a modified meantone is easy, and for a<br/>more moderate degree of temperament like Schlick&apos;s irregular scheme<br/>can easily be done by finessing only one note -- he could have done it<br/>if he&apos;d wanted to, and the same goes for a regular 1/6-comma meantone<br/>where we adjust one note to split the Wolf about equally between two<br/>fifths. Around 1/5-comma or 2/9-comma, we need to adjust two notes and<br/>have three fifths share the excess; while for 1/4-comma or 2/7-comma,<br/>this involves three adjusted notes or four comparably wide fifths.</p><p>However, I&apos;d agree that for tertian circulation or well-temperament,<br/>Werckmeister is a great innovator -- the only recorded earlier schemes<br/>that I can think of that would qualify would be proposals or purported<br/>proposals (like the one attributed by Doni to Frescobaldi) to tune<br/>keyboards in 12-EDO. Very basically, even if Grammateus had split a<br/>Pythagorean wolf into three or yet better four equal parts, achieving<br/>full fifth-circulation, it would address a medieval kind of style<br/>rather than the imperatives of meantone so central to Werckmeister.</p><p>Here the crucial imperative is requirement (2): the nearest major<br/>thirds should be 12-EDO or smoother, not the Pythagorean size so<br/>effective for medieval or neomedieval music but exactly what Schlick<br/>and others tuning regular or modified meantone around 1500 are seeking<br/>to get away from!  To people like Zarlino and Lippius a Pythagorean<br/>third is not only unstable but just about &quot;dissonant,&quot; although<br/>Praetorius gives us evidence that some people were ready to tolerate<br/>it in order to have some approximation of both Eb and D# on a 12-note<br/>instrument, for example. It&apos;s one thing to hit this now and then for<br/>some remote sonority or cadence, another to have it at some of your<br/>most frequently used locations for a 16th-century modal or<br/>18th-century tonal style.</p><p>As for colorful fifth-circulating modified meantones, emphatically<br/>including mine, as well as Schlick&apos;s rather more restrained approach,<br/>we encounter requirement (3) of well-temperament: no goat thirds.<br/>Note that this rule does _not_ exclude all fifths wider than pure, as<br/>long as they are discreetly deployed, as in some of Neidhardt&apos;s<br/>temperaments or Aaron Johnson&apos;s, so that thirds don&apos;t go substantially<br/>outside Pythagorean limits.</p><p>On the subject of goats, as opposed to wolves and dogs, these<br/>indubitably _are_ used in conventional as well as experimental<br/>16th-century writing where they are explicitly spelled as diminished<br/>fourths, for example. Here there is a fine and calculated balance,<br/>whether in a Spanish Psalm setting or in an avant garde madrigal by<br/>Monteverdi. The interval is &quot;cushioned&quot; by occurring between two upper<br/>voices; occurs in passing; or otherwise is treated with due<br/>discretion, rather like a more conventional suspension dissonance.</p><p>The open question is how often people made keyboard transpositions<br/>where these goat thirds were substituted for regularly spelled ones in<br/>a composition, and also whether composers, for example of the English<br/>virginals school, either desired or expected this to happen for some<br/>pieces going beyond the spellings available on a 12-note<br/>instrument. Denis goes to great length to warn about the perils of<br/>such transposed modes, which suggests that the practice wasn&apos;t unknown<br/>in early 17th-century Paris, at any rate. However, he associates it<br/>with organists too eager to accommodate singers, a motivation not so<br/>relevant to solo keyboard performances then or now.</p><p>&gt;  Margo: Maybe, like Schlick&apos;s, it could be called &quot;semi-circulating&quot;<br/>&gt;  -- but not necessarily by intent, as far as I know. Dowland&apos;s<br/>&gt;  irregular lute tuning is also interesting, and that has at least<br/>&gt;  one Wolf fifth, as I recall.</p><p>&gt;  Johnny: Dowland&apos;s tuning has different pitch distinctions for the<br/>&gt;  same pitch, making it an irregular irregular tuning.  As a lute<br/>&gt;  tuning that does not need to make a full circle, it may best be<br/>&gt;  categorized as a different can of beans.</p><p>Certainly I&apos;d agree that this is in a different category from a<br/>12-note modified meantone or the like, and maybe related to the<br/>_tastini_ or alternative frets that Vincenzo Galilei tells us that<br/>some lutenists used to improve the thirds.</p><p>&gt;   What do you think?</p><p>Mainly I think that we&apos;re discussing topics of great mutual interest,<br/>from different perspectives, of course. Yours, as a performer and<br/>advocate, may be the most valuable of all. I&apos;m not sure if any of this<br/>is intelligible and accessible, but if it is, I would be delighted.</p><p>&gt;   best, Johnny</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2007 1:35:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Hi Margo,<br/>&gt; &gt;  I noticed that you were absent from this list for<br/>&gt; &gt;  quite some time, and it&apos;s good to see you back again.<br/>&gt; &gt;  -monz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Monz,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for your warm welcome, and for your perennial<br/>&gt; presence and contributions.

The strange spot around 284<br/>&gt; cents, by the way, coincides with 33:28 (284.447 cents), for<br/>whatever<br/>&gt; reason.</p><p>Also 5:6 from the half-octave... and has some other &quot;coincidental&quot;<br/>features.

By the way, I wonder if<br/>maybe,<br/>&gt;    &gt;&gt; in the harmonic entropy kind of context, we might want a term<br/>&gt;    &gt;&gt; like &quot;assonance&quot; (that came up once, I seem to recall, in a<br/>&gt;    &gt;&gt; discussion where Heinz Bohlen was involved) or<br/>even &quot;isonance,&quot;<br/>&gt;    &gt;&gt; the latter meaning a kind of uniform or pervasive<br/>&gt;    &gt;&gt; non-coincidence of partials described by Professor Temes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    &gt; &quot;Isophones&quot; sounds very suitable, though I was thinking of the<br/>&gt;    &gt; same term for those skiaharmonic series consisting of harmonic<br/>&gt;    &gt; means.  To be most correct, maximally inharmonic intervals<br/>would<br/>&gt;    &gt; be truly &quot;xenharmonic&quot;- xenophones. I don&apos;t find that the<br/>maxima<br/>&gt;    &gt; of harmonic entropy to be &quot;the&quot; yardstick, or &quot;justify&quot;<br/>intervals<br/>&gt;    &gt; because they&apos;re found by HE, rather, the reverse, for the HE<br/>&gt;    &gt; charts I have seen have a number of intervals I found by far<br/>&gt;    &gt; simpler means.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Considering this, I&apos;d agree that &quot;isophones&quot; or &quot;isonance&quot; runs<br/>into a<br/>&gt; possible confusion with isoharmonic sonorities or chords, which<br/>have a<br/>&gt; ery clear and accepted meaning (e.g. 7:9:11:13). However, your<br/>&gt; &quot;xenophones,&quot; or maybe xenonances, looks perfect. These nobly<br/>intoned<br/>&gt; (NI) intervals, as Dave has named them, are indeed &quot;strange&quot; ones<br/>&gt;at<br/>&gt; ratios maximally distant by at least one possible mathematical<br/>&gt;measure<br/>&gt; from the familiar realm of simple ratios with coinciding partials.<br/>&gt; What I like about &quot;xenonance&quot; is that it tells us that this is<br/>&gt; definitely something different, but doesn&apos;t impose any viewpoint<br/>&gt;as to<br/>&gt; just how we should hear it -- as concord, discord, or something<br/>else.<br/>&gt; It also has a pleasant association with the &quot;xentonality&quot; of Bill<br/>&gt; Sethares.</p><p>Xenonance is a great word, LOL.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; With many thanks<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; , rather, thank you, Margot!

I will at some<br/>point have to get a generalized keyboard, for I want to put<br/>pure 7s into my tuning via a 68 framework.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t find the dark third or the middle third functionally<br/>&gt; &gt; different from the ones I use, but drive of your high third is<br/>more<br/>&gt; &gt; 9/7-y than the 422.323 cent high third I use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe I should just whether we&apos;re speaking of the 420.948-cent<br/>third,<br/>&gt; very close to yours (F#/Gb-Bb and G#/Ab-C in each 12-note circle),<br/>or<br/>&gt; the 433.517-cent third (C#/Db-F in each circle, with a few<br/>available<br/>&gt; also by combining notes from the two circles)?

One reason for sometimes<br/>&gt; preferring a version right around 2/7-comma for the regular<br/>meantone<br/>&gt; fifths is that Mark Lindley has suggested that this might be about<br/>the<br/>&gt; high end of the range with maximum euphony, and gentler on the<br/>fifths<br/>&gt; and major thirds than something further toward 1/3-comma. However,<br/>&gt; Wilson&apos;s Metameantone is quite comparable to your 88-EDO version,<br/>and<br/>&gt; that 7/4 makes 88-EDO a logical spot to choose in this neck or<br/>niche<br/>&gt; of the woods.</p><p>Wilson&apos;s Metameantone sounds superb, I think I failed to mention<br/>this when Kraig brought it up a little while ago but now I&apos;ve<br/>corrected my lapse.</p><p>take care,</p><p>Cameron Bobro</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2007 7:52:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes dear tuners, mad as a hatter.

After checking out the canines in<br/>&gt; Schlick, I found some variance in the calculations.</p><p>Hi, Johnny. Looking over your post, I&apos;d say that two factors may<br/>be in play here. The first is that Schlick&apos;s temperament can have<br/>different shades of interpretation, so people&apos;s numbers may<br/>differ a bit. The second is that we may be using the term &quot;dogs&quot;<br/>or &quot;canines&quot; a bit differently -- and each use has its own logic.</p><p>&gt;  Firstly, there are indeed 2 dogs in Schlick&#xFFFD;s temperament, not<br/>&gt;  one. The larger dog is from C# to G# at 711 cents according<br/>&gt;  to Lindley&apos;s numbers, and the smaller dog is three cents sharp<br/>&gt;  from just between G# and D#, as exists on the Halberstadt<br/>&gt;  keyboard.</p><p>OK, what&apos;s happening here is that we were defining our &quot;dogs&quot;<br/>differently. You are counting _wide_ fifths, by however much.<br/>I am counting fifths far enough from pure in either direction to<br/>constitute a &quot;navigational hazard&quot; to the style of music in<br/>question.</p><p>Your usage has a natural logic behind it. A wide Wolf in meantone<br/>is a kind of wild or howling canine. Thus even if a fifth in a<br/>modified system like Schlick&apos;s is only three cents wide, we can<br/>still think of it as a &quot;domesticated canine,&quot; although it&apos;s no<br/>hazard at all to navigation.</p><p>How about &quot;poodle fifth&quot;?</p><p>Maybe we could agree that Schlick has &quot;one semi-Wolf and one<br/>poodle fifth.&quot;</p><p>&gt;  J. Murray Barbour found different values for Schlick, making<br/>&gt;  the smaller dog a bit bigger at four cents sharp of just.</p><p>Yes, he interpreted the tuning as fully fifth-circulating, and a<br/>logical step toward 12-tET.</p><p>&gt; With all other fifths flatter than just, this smaller dog is<br/>&gt; even more noticeable.  This is the reason I consider Schlick an<br/>&gt; irregular tuning musician, someone that relished a variety of<br/>&gt; keys, is that I read this about him.  Sadly, I do not know of a<br/>&gt; full translation for Schlick.  (It really is hard to trust<br/>&gt; second and third hand sources.)</p><p>Certainly we agree that this is an irregular tuning; and if we<br/>use &quot;key&quot; in a kind of neutral way, as Morley did, to mean simply<br/>a location or transposition of a piece (modal or tonal), a bit<br/>like the 17th-century French use of _ton_, variegation of keys or<br/>modal transpositions is indeed what happens in Schlick.</p><p>&gt;   And Fischer, too, had only 20 ueable keys that were easily<br/>&gt;   distinguishable with 2 dogs.</p><p>A quick comment: in describing a tuning, I&apos;d want to distinguish<br/>my Wolves or semi-Wolves from my gentle poodles. A fifth 9 cents<br/>off in either direction is going to stand out in a typical<br/>meantone or WT context, and not pleasantly. A fifth 4 cents wide<br/>is in my view no problem at all, and often about as far off from<br/>pure as the usual narrow fifths in the other direction; if it<br/>causes any problems, it might do so by breeding goat thirds<br/>inappropriate to the style. (How&apos;s that for a mixed metaphor?)</p><p>&gt;   And Werckmeister IV/Trost as well.  In contrast, meantone is<br/>&gt;   indistinguishable in chord function interval quality, with<br/>&gt;   only non-harmonic tones providing color/or meantone variant<br/>&gt;   distinction as per Tom.  My sense is that meantone provides<br/>&gt;   the greatest real impetus to ET, while deriving as well from<br/>&gt;   a homogenization of well temperaments, while taking the<br/>&gt;   ultimate advantage of the properties of the number 12, and<br/>&gt;   the development of the modern piano.</p><p>Here I&apos;m looking at this from what I&apos;d take to be one meantone<br/>era perspective. Where a meantone around 1/4-comma or 2/7-comma<br/>differs from 12-tET dramatically is in the unequal semitones,<br/>which really come out in 16th-century chromaticism; and also in<br/>the &quot;special effects&quot; intervals like diminished fourths or<br/>augmented fifths, etc. People around 1550-1650 were familiar both<br/>with meantone on keyboards and 12-tET on lutes, and argued about<br/>the virtues or vices of each system (Galilei, Mersenne, Doni,<br/>Denis, etc.).</p><p>Certainly I understand your point that both meantone and 12-tET<br/>provide uniform interval sizes as to the &quot;usual&quot; intervals, such<br/>as regular major and minor thirds. As someone to whom &quot;modern&quot;<br/>often means &quot;around 1600,&quot; I give weight to those &quot;unusual&quot;<br/>intervals, and to chromatic progressions as well. From a<br/>perspective of 1750 or 1850, I can see your point. Someone who<br/>likes the uniform sweetness of a meantone organ might conclude<br/>that if we need a 12-note circulating system, let&apos;s at least make<br/>everything as uniform as possible -- thus 12-tET.</p><p>[...]</p><p>&gt;  I loved the use of dog and goat intervals in your writing.  It<br/>&gt;  makes for easier reading and understanding.  Using this turn<br/>&gt;  of speech, I guess the major third in C# major in sixth comma<br/>&gt;  meantone at 416 cents is a goat third, because it bleets.  How<br/>&gt;  about the large major second in that same key, at 220 cents;<br/>&gt;  perhaps it is a frog second because it jumps higher?</p><p>That&apos;s a good question. Getting back to our &quot;dogs,&quot; maybe we<br/>could say that a &quot;canine&quot; is simply any fifth that is tempered in<br/>the opposite direction from the prevailing one; or is<br/>significantly impure in either direction in a just tuning. A Wolf<br/>is deemed unusable; a semi-Wolf generally avoided; and a &quot;poodle&quot;<br/>about as well-behaved as the other fifths tempered in the<br/>opposite direction, or maybe even more so.</p><p>Actually I do have a term for a major second around 220 cents:<br/>that would be a largish major second or whole tone approaching<br/>the ratio of 8:7 (231 cents). To me 10:9 (182 cents) is small;<br/>9:8 (204 cents) is middle; and 8:7 is large. I&apos;m not sure about<br/>animal metaphors, however.</p><p>&gt;   Yes, I do appreciate Barnes&apos;s work.  Jorgensen has done a lot<br/>&gt;   of good, but I don&apos;t understanding how he could mislead<br/>&gt;   listeners to Anthony Newman&apos;s harpsichord performance of The<br/>&gt;   Well-tempered Clavier by describing the tuning as<br/>&gt;   Aron-Neidhardt II, rather than as Kirnberger III.  As to no<br/>&gt;   one tuning accurate ET in the Baroque, how about Neidardt<br/>&gt;   doing so quite publicly in Jena in 1703, using a monochord.<br/>&gt;   (Where there&apos;s one there&apos;s many.)</p><p>Please let me say that I&apos;m not a member of the &quot;12-tET was<br/>impossible in the 18th century on keyboards&quot; school, and I have<br/>great respect for Neidhardt. It&apos;s only fair to add that I&apos;m more<br/>familiar with earlier eras; but Neidhardt&apos;s craft, like Bach&apos;s<br/>counterpoint, is something that almost anyone might admire.</p><p>&gt;   Back to meantone alternatives, it is the variegation of the<br/>&gt;   harmonic notes of keys that distinguished the irregular<br/>&gt;   tunings.  Even though these irregular tunings (to include<br/>&gt;   both Grammateus and Schlick) have different derivations, the<br/>&gt;   ear only hears the variety of harmonic connections in<br/>&gt;   irregulars.  With every key a different sounding tuning, no<br/>&gt;   one can tell them apart!</p><p>Do you mean that given that Grammateus and Schlick are both<br/>variegated, no one can tell these two tunings apart?</p><p>If so, I&apos;d say let&apos;s take a keyboard prelude in an F mode, for<br/>example, around 1500, and compare the 408-cent thirds at F-A,<br/>C-E- and G-B in Grammateus with the same thirds somewhere around<br/>390-394 cents in Schlick (say 1/5-1/6 comma). The first is<br/>appropriate to a late medieval style based on some variation of<br/>Pythagorean tuning, the second to a Renaissance style of the kind<br/>that assumes meantone temperament.</p><p>&gt;  It was funny to read today in a biography of Frederick the<br/>&gt;  Great how horrified the King was of the irregulars on the<br/>&gt;  other side in war.  In his meantone court, the soldiers were<br/>&gt;  clearly intended to be regular.  As you may know, Quantz built<br/>&gt;  meantone distinctive keys into his new flutes/ D#-Eb, for<br/>&gt;  example has a different key for each chromatic identity.</p><p>Around 1600, meantone might not necessarily be associated with<br/>&quot;regularity&quot; if we look at all the keyboard pieces celebrating<br/>_durezze_ (&quot;little dissonances&quot;) and augmented or diminished<br/>intervals. People with split keyboards were often taking the<br/>opportunity to relish rather than avoid these intervals.<br/>Similarly, Artusi regarded Monteverdi as undisciplined for<br/>writing C#-F (thus spelled) in one of his madrigals, although he<br/>considered it fine on a 12-tET lute, and suggested that this<br/>composer didn&apos;t know the difference! Meantone may mean different<br/>things to different people in different periods.</p><p>&gt;   Margo, you might want to revisit your idea that &quot;If we see a<br/>&gt;   fifth Ab-Eb, I&apos;d take that as a hint that the piece is<br/>&gt;   intended for an instrument which actually has both notes!&#xFFFD;<br/>&gt;   This is exactly true, unless it is a circular well<br/>&gt;   temperament, and of course, 12-tET.  Werckmeister was<br/>&gt;   explicit, though, that chromatics like Eb and D# were to be<br/>&gt;   intended as enharmonic identities, while recognizing it might<br/>&gt;   not take.  Obviously, I think is ideas took big time,<br/>&gt;   contrary to some on this List.</p><p>Please let me quickly and concisely (for once!) clarify that I<br/>was speaking specifically of a meantone instrument around<br/>1/4-comma or 2/7-comma temperament. In a context where enharmonic<br/>identity applies, as for many 16th-century lutes in 12-tET as<br/>well as 12-note WT a la Werckmeister, my statement obviously<br/>doesn&apos;t apply -- as you&apos;re very right to point out.</p><p>We much agree that enharmonic equivalence for keyboards is an<br/>idea &quot;which took big time&quot; -- maybe a bit of an understatement.</p><p>&gt;  I guess I don&apos;t care for the very idea of modified meantone.<br/>&gt;  It creates a hazy distinction between the 2 categories I am<br/>&gt;  looking at.</p><p>Of course, we&apos;ll each have our own tastes, in tunings and in<br/>categorizations of them.</p><p>&gt;  It&apos;s understandable that there were individuals that tuned<br/>&gt;  every which way.  However, I am against imaginative<br/>&gt;  contemporary interpretations as akin to the way<br/>&gt;  anthropologists whitewashed their studies of native American<br/>&gt;  music.</p><p>Of course the example of the music of the First Nations has a<br/>special force because here we&apos;re talking about a context of<br/>ethnocide, ethnic cleansing, and often outright genocide.</p><p>More generally, as someone who strives both to teach history and<br/>to create new &quot;alternative history&quot; (George Secor and Daniel Wolf<br/>have written eloquently on this latter concept), I do feel a<br/>responsibility in my writing not to confuse the second with the<br/>first.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2007 9:58:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Although this conclusion seems rather to &quot;gallop to a conclusion,&quot;<br/>which may be appropriate for an arrow-armed horseman, I think it&apos;s<br/>great that this entertaining and educational presentation of this<br/>important microtonal notation has &quot;come full circle&quot; so to speak... :)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p><p>P.S.

This is under the Scala reading where the most<br/>heavily tempered fifths are around 694 and 710 cents; Paul Erlich was<br/>willing to consider going this far under very different circumstances<br/>to optimize septimal ratios for his &quot;paultones&quot; with fifths around<br/>22-EDO, or possibly a bit larger.</p><p>If it&apos;s within 7 cents or so of just, I generally would simply call it<br/>a &quot;fifth&quot; -- noting the direction of temperament where that is<br/>relevant (&quot;wide&quot; or &quot;narrow&quot;). The new term &quot;poodle&quot; sounds very nice,<br/>and I _would_ use it for a 707-cent fifth in a tuning where 697 cents<br/>is the norm. As far as I&apos;m concerned, the two are equally circulating.</p><p>Maybe this reflects my custom of quite routinely tempering fifths in<br/>either or both directions -- all regular fifths wide in Peppermint or<br/>a 17-note circulating temperament; all narrow in regular meantone; and<br/>a mixture of eight narrow and four wide in my modified meantones.</p><p>Similarly, Charles, I regard a major third around 9:7 as routine and<br/>desirable, and at the same time distinct from 5:4, rather as some fine<br/>ornate typeface is distinct from a simple and smooth one. Juxtaposing<br/>the two indiscriminately, in music or typesetting, is not necessarily<br/>the formula for aural or visual concord. In a modified meantone like<br/>the one I use, where all the fifths are comparably impure, I would<br/>consider Db-F at close to 9:7 as the glory of Eb Dorian or C Phrygian,<br/>where this third respectively contracts to a unison or expands to a<br/>fifth; these modalities almost by definition call for a medieval or<br/>neomedieval style. Of course, it also makes a striking and compelling<br/>diminished fourth in a Renaissance meantone setting. The fun question<br/>is which transitions or juxtapositions are pleasant and desirable.</p><p>Then, again, I&apos;m ready to go rather further than 9:7 when it comes to<br/>cadential major thirds expanding to fifths, with an article by Jay<br/>Rahn about Marchettus of Padua as the basis for the following:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/PythEnharImprov01.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/PythEnharImprov01.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>What I&apos;ve decided is that making new music should be my first<br/>priority, and offering some curious verbalizations about what I&apos;m up<br/>to, however imperfect and incomplete, a good next priority. That means<br/>discussing lots of history, and making some alternative history, which<br/>with a passionate enough immersion in both need be distinguished only<br/>when convenient for certain pedagogic purposes. Those purposes often<br/>_are_ relevant and convenient, by the way.</p><p>A quick final note on Werckmeister V: I&apos;d call it a nice circulating<br/>temperament, and note with curiosity that it achieves one goal also<br/>important to my 2/7-comma temperament extraordinaire in a 16th-century<br/>context: keeping major thirds on the six untransposed modal finals no<br/>larger than about 396 cents. Of course, they are radically different<br/>systems, and Werckmeister was presumably focusing mainly on tonality<br/>around the end of the 17th century rather than polyphonic modality of<br/>one kind or another.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/25/2007 3:18:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo:  Johnny, to me a &quot;Wolf&quot; or &quot;semi-Wolf&quot;  means a fifth rather more than<br/>1/3 syntonic comma impure -- with 1/3  Pythagorean comma (as in<br/>Werckmeister IV) sort of pushing the envelope, but  still just within a<br/>&quot;circulating&quot; category.

I can certainly accept<br/>that  you feel this way, and I speak more regularly with Paul as I&rsquo;m planning to<br/>do my  Odysseus in Boston on May 4 and Paul is  playing.<br/>While I await a possible  correction from Paul on WIV in C major, I believe<br/>the historical situation for  Werckmeister, who inherited his positions using<br/>what he now call WIV, but which  he credited to Trost and his unnamed late<br/>cousin.  My suspicion it is because Andreas was  primarily recognized as an<br/>improviser rather than a composer.  I have been performing every  Werckmeister piece<br/>I can find, more recently his Praeludium in G from the  Halle  dissertation.<br/>Most famously, the  Christmas cantata Wo ist die neugeborne Konig auf den<br/>Juden (PITCH 200202 Early).</p><p>Margo:  If it&apos;s within 7 cents or so of just, I  generally would simply call<br/>it<br/>a &quot;fifth&quot; -- noting the direction of  temperament where that is<br/>relevant (&quot;wide&quot; or &quot;narrow&quot;).

Werckmeister actually used the<br/>word  Circul to indicate the difference between WIII and WIV.  (Sorry everyone<br/>that the names of these  prominent scales are so arcane.)  What you like to<br/>hear, or consider sounding nice, doesn&rsquo;t change the  facts.  If one is allergic<br/>to dogs,  even the nicest, sweetest poodle would still cause an allergic<br/>response.  It may be one of the most amazing  challenges, the ability to get into<br/>someone&rsquo;s head.  Actors do it all the time.  Musicians are often actors,<br/>usually the  best of them.  Getting into the mind  of a long dead person through<br/>their writing may be toughest of all.  As I said to Paul, I do not think the<br/>literature portends the full story.  At best it is a part of the story.  The<br/>literature is more interesting in its influence of later  generations.</p><p>Margo:  Maybe this reflects my custom of quite  routinely tempering fifths in<br/>either or both directions -- all regular fifths  wide in Peppermint or<br/>a 17-note circulating temperament; all narrow in  regular meantone; and<br/>a mixture of eight narrow and four wide in my modified  meantones.</p><p>Johnny: Exactly, you have  stretched ears.  Me, too.  That&rsquo;s why I recognize<br/>the  condition.  It&rsquo;s no different than  musicians being over sensitive to<br/>sound in general.  We have stretched our minds in to  encompass dissonance as<br/>consonance.  The French take the just third of 386 cents and recoil in horror at<br/>its  dissonance (anecdotal).<br/>Your later comments: &ldquo;What  I&apos;ve decided is that making new music should be<br/>my first<br/>priority, and  offering some curious verbalizations about what I&apos;m up<br/>to, however imperfect  and incomplete, a good next priority&rdquo; make total sense<br/>as regards your  intervallic reactions.</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@calweb.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2007 3:56:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, Leonardo and Monz and all.</p><p>Please let me bring you up to date: I&apos;m now in the middle of the process<br/>of going through the translation and making suggestions.

Since it was a commentary by Brad Lehman to his<br/>temperament spreadsheet that made me aware of these convenient units,<br/>I warmly dedicate this modest essay to him.</p><p>There may be a certain paradox, Brad, in my dedicating this essay<br/>about synthesizer tuning to you, above all a paragon of the craft of<br/>tuning historical instruments by ear. Please let me emphasize that<br/>this dedication is a token of deepest appreciation and indebtedness<br/>which, however, should carry no implications as to how you might view<br/>my curious methods and musical goals.</p><p>---------------------------<br/>1. What is nanotemperament?<br/>---------------------------</p><p>For many microtunable hardware synthesizers, the units of tuning are<br/>rather coarse, on the order of 1-2 cents. Theoretically &quot;regular&quot;<br/>temperaments often become in practice necessarily irregular, in order<br/>to balance out the synthesizer tuning units.</p><p>A very practical example is my temperament extraordinaire based on<br/>Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone, with eight fifths (F-C#) in this regular<br/>tuning, and the other four tempered equally wide. For more information<br/>on this general style of temperament, people might wish to visit:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/TE1.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/TE1.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>In theory, at least, the meantone fifths should be narrow by about<br/>6.145 cents, and the wide ones by 6.424 cents -- not that any tuning<br/>by ear could be anywhere near this precise!</p><p>As it happens, I could not be this precise on my Yahama TX-802<br/>synthesizer either. Here there are 1024 tuning steps per octave, so<br/>that each is 1.171875 cents. An interval of 599 steps is a virtually<br/>just 3:2 fifth (actually about 0.002 cents narrow), so that for all<br/>practical purposes one may regard this fifth as pure.</p><p>Unfortunately, the desired narrow temperament for the meantone fifths<br/>of 6.145 cents (2/7-comma) is not an even multiple of 1.171875 cents.<br/>Our nearest approximations are either 5 steps narrow (5.859 cents);<br/>or 6 steps narrow (7.0325 cents).</p><p>A serviceable compromise, however, is available: _nanotemperament_, or<br/>introducing very small variations in the sizes of the theoretically<br/>regular fifths in order to have them &quot;average out&quot; at about 2/7-comma<br/>narrow. Specifically, a chain of three fifths each 5 steps narrow,<br/>plus one 6 steps narrow, means an average tempering of about 6.152<br/>cents, almost identical to the desired 6.145 cents.</p><p>Another way to gauge the accuracy of this &quot;averaging out&quot; is to<br/>consider that a regular major third in 2/7-comma is about 383.241<br/>cents, or 1/7 comma narrow of 5:4. Our nanotemperament produces a<br/>third of 383.203 cents. Since there are eight of these narrow fifths<br/>to be tuned, we can arrange them in two groups of four, so that any<br/>major third with both notes within this accidental range will have<br/>this size virtually identical to that of Zarlino&apos;s meantone. Thus:</p><p>    F     C     G     D     A     E    B    F#    C#<br/>      -5    -5    -6    -5    -5    -5   -6    -5</p><p>The theoretically uniform tempering of the wide fifths, 6.424 cents,<br/>likewise is not an even multiple of the 1.171875-cent synthesizer<br/>unit, or very close to such a multiple. Again, the nearest available<br/>amounts of temperament are 5 steps (5.857 cents) or 6 steps (7.029<br/>cents).</p><p>However, a chain with two fifths at 5 steps and two fifths at 6 steps<br/>wide produces an average temperament of about 6.443 cents wide --<br/>again, almost identical to the desired size. Together, these four<br/>fifths produce a major third (or meantone diminished fourth) at around<br/>433.594 cents, as compared with 433.517 cents in the theoretical<br/>version.</p><p>Now we come to an interesting decision -- or rather accident -- that<br/>occurred in implementing this concept. For whatever reason, rather<br/>than arranging the pattern of wide 5-step and 6-step fifths as evenly<br/>as possible, I found myself with this situation:</p><p>                C#     G#     D#/Eb     Bb     F<br/>                   +5     +6        +6     +5</p><p>Here the two fifths tempered by 6 steps are placed adjacent to one<br/>another. What I seem to recall is that I was thinking along the lines<br/>of a traditional meantone chain, and going by the impression that the<br/>more &quot;remote&quot; fifths on each end of the chain (G#-D#/Eb and Eb-Bb)<br/>should be the more heavily tempered.</p><p>Only later did I note this slight &quot;unevenness&quot; and consider the<br/>implications for the tuning. Such a consideration invites a convenient<br/>measure which happens almost exactly to mesh with the synthesizer<br/>tuning system: Brombaugh&apos;s temperament units.</p><p>-----------------------------<br/>2. A (nano)temperament recipe<br/>-----------------------------</p><p>In Brombaugh&apos;s system, there are 720 temperament units (TU) in a<br/>Pythagorean comma, 531441:524288 or 23.460 cents. A syntonic comma at<br/>81:80 (21.506 cents) is virtually equal to 660 TU; and a septimal<br/>comma at 64:63 (27.264 cents) to about 837 TU, and almost exactly<br/>to 836.75 TU.</p><p>On a synthesizer like the TX-802 dividing the octave into 1024 equal<br/>steps, 20 of these steps are almost precisely equal to a Pythagorean<br/>comma, or 720 TU; and one synthesizer step to 1/20 of this comma, or<br/>36 TU (actually about 35.965 TU).</p><p>A tempering of 5 synthesizer steps will thus be equivalent to 1/4 of a<br/>Pythagorean comma or 180 TU; and 6 steps to 3/10 of the comma or 216 TU.</p><p>We can use negative values to show temperament in a narrow or meantone<br/>direction, and positive values to show temperament in a wide direction.<br/>The following temperament recipe results:</p><p>F    C    G    D    A    E    B    F#    C#    G#   D#/Eb   Bb     F<br/>-180  -180 -216 -180 -180 -180 -216  -180  +180  +216   +216  +180</p><p>Here 6 fifths at -180 TU plus two at -216 TU do a total of 1512 TU of<br/>negative temperament, exceeding the 720 TU of the Pythagorean comma by<br/>792 TU. The 2 wide fifths at +180 cents, plus the 2 at +216 cents, do<br/>792 TU of positive temperament -- thus balancing the circle.</p><p>The obvious compromise in this arrangement, of course, is that some<br/>narrow and wide fifths alike will be tempered at just over 7 cents<br/>impure, a degree of temperament comparable to 1/3-comma meantone or<br/>the almost identical system of 19-tone equal temperament (19-tET),<br/>also known as a 19-note equal division of the octave (19-EDO). Among<br/>regular tunings with wide fifths, 22-EDO is also comparable.</p><p>Given that this compromise is unavoidable on such a synthesizer if we<br/>wish to approximate the 2/7-comma temperament extraordinaire, we might<br/>ask if any benefits are derived from this necessity. Before addressing<br/>this question, we should quickly mention an alternative.</p><p>To avoid having any fifths more impure in either direction than 180 TU<br/>(5 synthesizer units), we could simply temper the 8 meantone fifths at<br/>180 TU narrow each, and the other four fifths at 180 TU wide -- so<br/>that each is tempered by 1/4 Pythagorean comma. This procedure would<br/>yield a very nice temperament while keeping all fifths within 6 cents<br/>of pure. Further, it would not require any nanotemperament, since a<br/>fifth tempered at 5 synthesizer steps narrow or wide is for all<br/>practical purposes tempered by 1/4 Pythagorean comma or 180 TU in the<br/>chosen direction.</p><p>However, I must admit that using Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma as the basis for<br/>a circulating system does has a special historical appeal to me: this<br/>is the first known meantone (1558) to be described in precise<br/>mathematical terms. Thus the above temperament recipe is an invitation<br/>to a meeting between the old and the new, with the &quot;seasoning&quot; of<br/>nanotemperament having two especially interesting consequences.</p><p>---------------------------------------<br/>3. Optimizing the smallest minor thirds<br/>---------------------------------------</p><p>In a temperament extraordinaire, one of the primary goals is to obtain<br/>some small minor and large major thirds at or close to the septimal<br/>ratios of 7:6 and 9:7, or about 267 and 435 cents; these will be the<br/>smallest minor and largest major thirds of the tuning, generated<br/>respectively by a chain of three or four wide fifths.</p><p>To see how my inadvertant nanotemperament scheme for the remote<br/>portion of the circle served to promote this quest, let us consider<br/>the relevant region of the tuning recipe:</p><p>            C#/Db      G#/Ab     D#/Eb     A#/Bb      F<br/>                 +180       +216      +216      +180</p><p>Since a minor third is generated from a chain of three fourths up<br/>(F-Bb-Eb-Ab) or three fifths down, we can read this diagram from right<br/>to left in order to locate the two minor thirds generated from three<br/>wide fifths (or narrow fourths): F-Ab and Bb-Db.</p><p>Having the two more heavily tempered fifths at 3/10 Pythagorean comma<br/>or 216 TU placed together in the central portion of this wide-fifth<br/>region, with the two fifths at 1/4 Pythagorean comma or 180 TU at the<br/>borders of the region, ensures that any minor third formed from three<br/>wide fifths will get both of the 216 TU fifths, together with one<br/>&quot;border&quot; fifth at 180 TU. This adds up to 612 TU of temperament in the<br/>direction of 7:6.</p><p>Thus here is the situation for F-Ab:</p><p>                                F-Ab      +612 TU<br/>                         |----------------------------|<br/>            C#/Db      G#/Ab     D#/Eb     A#/Bb      F<br/>                 +180       +216      +216      +180</p><p>and likewise for Bb-Db:</p><p>                      Bb-Db     +612 TU<br/>              |------------------------------|<br/>            C#/Db      G#/Ab     D#/Eb     A#/Bb      F<br/>                 +180       +216      +216      +180</p><p>How close to 7:6 are these small minor thirds? A minor third from a<br/>chain of four pure 3:2 fifths would have a Pythagorean size of 32:27<br/>or 294.135 cents. To obtain a just 7:6 third (266.871 cents), we must<br/>do a full septimal comma (64:63) of tempering in the wide-fifth<br/>direction, 27.264 cents or about 837 TU (almost precisely 836.75 TU).</p><p>Here we have done 612 TU of tempering for each of our smallest minor<br/>thirds, leaving them about 225 TU wide of a just 7:6 -- or 7.323<br/>cents. These thirds have a size of about 274.194 cents.</p><p>In the theoretical model for a 2/7-comma temperament extraordinaire,<br/>these same thirds would have a size of 274.862 cents; so the necessity<br/>of nanotemperament, along with the quirk of my placing those two wide<br/>fifths at 216 TU together, has resulted in &quot;optimizing&quot; these<br/>approximations of 7:6.</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>4. Outlying meantone thirds and E Phrygian<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>A temperament extraordinaire is meant for playing in modal styles of<br/>music: typically Renaissance and Manneristic styles premised on<br/>meantone in the nearer portion of the circle; and medieval or<br/>neomedieval styles in the remote part of the circle premised on<br/>Pythagorean intonation and its accentuated modern variations and<br/>offshoots.</p><p>For music in Renaissance and Manneristic styles, having restful major<br/>thirds quite close to 5:4 is an important consideration. This is<br/>obviously no problem in the F-C# region of the tuning, identical to<br/>Zarlino&apos;s regular 2/7-comma temperament -- apart from small and mostly<br/>inconsequential variations on synthesizer due to nanotemperament. The<br/>most &quot;consequential&quot; variation is that the fifths G-D and B-F# are<br/>narrow by a tad more than 7 cents, rather than the 6.145 cents of<br/>Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma. In effect, they are approximate 1/3-comma fifths:<br/>tolerable, but not necessarily ideal.</p><p>Of more concern, from the perspective of major third quality, is the<br/>&quot;outlying meantone&quot; region occupied by the thirds Bb-D and E-G#,<br/>formed from three narrow fifths plus one wide fifth. In a theoretical<br/>model of a 2/7-comma temperament extraordinaire, these thirds would be<br/>at 395.810 cents, or 9.497 cents wide of 5:4. This is comparable to<br/>the regular major thirds of 1/7-comma meantone (395.531 cents), and<br/>also to the smallest and mildest major thirds of Werckmeister V and<br/>some Neidhardt well-temperaments, for example, at 1/2 Pythagorean<br/>comma smaller than the Pythagorean 81:64 (407.820 cents), or 396.090<br/>cents.</p><p>Granted that using these considerably compromised major thirds in<br/>place of their regular meantone counterparts is less than ideal, we<br/>might wish, at least, to keep these &quot;outlying meantone&quot; thirds Bb-D<br/>and E-G# as close to 5:4 as reasonably possible. This can be<br/>especially desirable for E-G#, routinely used in closing sonorities in<br/>untransposed E Phrygian, a common and very beautiful modality.</p><p>Here nanotemperament can contribute a small but helpful nudge in the<br/>right direction. Let us focus on the nearer of meantone portion of the<br/>tuning recipe, plus the two wide fifths Bb-F and C#-G# that border it.</p><p>  Bb     F     C     G      D     A     E     B     F#     C#     G#<br/>    +180  -180  -180   -216  -180  -180  -180  -216   -180   +180</p><p>The two outlying meantone major thirds Bb-D and E-G# each have a<br/>generating chain of four fifths including one fifth narrow by 216 TU,<br/>two narrow by 180 TU, and one wide by 180 TU. The wide fifth, in<br/>effect, &quot;cancels out&quot; the narrow tempering done by one of the 180 TU<br/>fifths. This leaves a narrow tempering of 216 TU plus 180 TU, or a<br/>total of 396 TU.</p><p>A chain of four pure 3:2 fifths would produce a Pythagorean major<br/>third at 81:64; to obtain a pure 5:4 (386.314 cents), we must do a<br/>full syntonic comma (81:80, 21.506 cents) or 660 TU of narrow<br/>tempering. Here we have done 396 TU, or 3/5 of that comma, leaving<br/>Bb-D and E-G# wide of 5:4 by 2/5 comma, or about 8.603 cents -- a size<br/>of about 394.916 cents.</p><p>This is almost a cent closer to 5:4 than the theoretically expected<br/>value of 395.810 cents, and curiously comparable to the smallest<br/>minor thirds in the Prelleur temperament at about 394.669 cents. It is<br/>still hardly an ideal situation, but a viable compromise slightly<br/>improved.</p><p>Interestingly, this modestly more pleasant result with Bb-D and E-G#<br/>owes itself in part to the same cause as the closer approach to 7:6 of<br/>the small minor thirds F-Ab and Bb-Db: the arrangement of the four<br/>wide fifths.</p><p>Arranging them with the two fifths at +180 TU, Bb-F and C#-G#, both<br/>placed on the borders of the meantone region, as shown in the last<br/>diagram, means that Bb-D and E-G# will each have in their generating<br/>chains a wide fifth cancelling out only 180 TU rather than 216 TU of<br/>the desired narrow temperament provided by the other three fifths.</p><p>Instead, the two more heavily tempered wide fifths G#-D#/Eb and Eb-Bb<br/>are concentrated at the center of their region, as discussed in<br/>Section 3, where rather than undesirably moving outlying meantone<br/>major thirds further from 5:4, they can agreeably draw our smallest<br/>minor thirds nearer to 7:6.</p><p>-----------------------------------<br/>5. Conclusion, or postlude for Brad<br/>-----------------------------------</p><p>Each tuning form, and musical style, may have its own constraints and<br/>preferences. Writing this essay has been an opportunity to reflect on<br/>some of the historical contrasts and playful paradoxes that can arise<br/>when, as Vicentino proposed in his famous title, &quot;ancient music&quot; is<br/>&quot;reduced&quot; or &quot;adapted&quot; to &quot;modern practice.&quot;</p><p>I have devoted considerable space to the quest for 7:6 and 9:7 thirds<br/>in a modern circulating temperament, because it is for me a high<br/>musical priority -- but by no means necessarily a priority for those<br/>of the meantone era, with interesting exceptions (notably Huygens).</p><p>Indeed, as Paul Poletti recently noted, Michael Praetorius reported a<br/>name that early 17th-century musicians had given to the meantone<br/>augmented second F-G#: &quot;the wolf,&quot; a term now especially associated<br/>with the diminished sixth or augmented third (e.g. G#-Eb or Eb-G#) in<br/>a regular meantone tempered by about 1/6-comma or more.</p><p>Since Praetorius specifically favored 1/4-comma meantone with pure 5:4<br/>major thirds -- the &quot;Praetorian&quot; temperament to later writers such as<br/>Werckmeister -- we know that F-G# was very close to a just 7:6. Yet he<br/>very clearly describes it as a &quot;false minor third&quot; -- an obstacle to<br/>free harmonic navigation encountered in a usual 12-note temperament,<br/>rather than an adornment, as Huygens would declare it in 1691.</p><p>It is thus a somewhat humorous modern predicament to be debating how<br/>much to compromise both the narrow and wide fifths of a temperament<br/>extraordinaire in order to &quot;optimize for 7:6&quot; -- that is, in terms<br/>like those of Praetorius, to keep the &quot;wolves&quot; at F-G# and Bb-C# as<br/>&quot;wolfish&quot; as possible while getting the fifths to circulate.</p><p>Moving ahead to the era of Bach and well-temperaments which you have<br/>studied and explored so intimately, Brad, I also reflect on the<br/>possible distinctions between modal and tonal approaches to the<br/>question of the major third E-G#.</p><p>In a 16th-century modal style, where it is customary often to have<br/>closing sonorities including a major third above the modal final,<br/>obtained by inflection if necessary, E-G# is basic to E Phrygian, and<br/>is one of my first criteria for evaluating any 12-note circulating<br/>system. More generally, I would like each of the untransposed modal<br/>finals (C, D, E, F, G, A) to have a major third within 9-10 cents of a<br/>pure 5:4; and likewise Bb-D, which may occur often in various modes.</p><p>A temperament extraordinaire can meet this goal with fewer compromises<br/>than tonal 12-note well-temperaments, because an equally important<br/>goal is to obtain major thirds in the more remote portion of the<br/>circle at sizes such as 421 cents or 434 cents. These are &quot;excellent<br/>neomedieval thirds&quot; -- a rather different description than might be<br/>applied in a tonal context around 1706 or 1722!</p><p>Thus each art form, contrapuntal or intonational, may have its own<br/>peculiar rules. Brad, my warmest thanks to you as an artist and<br/>scholar who has brought to my attention the noble ingenuity of the<br/>temperament unit, and inspired me to seek creative by-ways for<br/>applying it.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@calweb.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2007 10:33:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[On my view that Werckmeister IV might be marginally circulating]</p><p>&gt;  Johnny: If that was true for Werckmeister, he would never have<br/>&gt;  suffered the grief that he did in promoting WIII ahead of WIV.

My gut reaction is to run up and<br/>embrace those thirds as old friends! -- but _not_ evidently the<br/>general period view. Here WIII has tonal circulation; WIV doesn&apos;t.</p><p>By the way, so that people can compare notes and versions, here&apos;s<br/>Scala&apos;s version of WIV in an octave of C-C:</p><p>! werck4.scl<br/>!<br/>Andreas Werckmeister&apos;s temperament IV<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 82.40600<br/> 196.09000<br/> 32/27<br/> 392.18000<br/> 4/3<br/> 1024/729<br/> 694.13500<br/> 784.36100<br/> 890.22500<br/> 1003.91000<br/> 4096/2187<br/> 2/1</p><p>&gt;  While I await a possible correction from Paul on WIV in C major, I<br/>&gt;  believe the historical situation for Werckmeister, who inherited<br/>&gt;  his positions using what he now call WIV, but which he credited to<br/>&gt;  Trost and his unnamed late cousin.  My suspicion it is because<br/>&gt;  Andreas was primarily recognized as an improviser rather than a<br/>&gt;  composer.  I have been performing every Werckmeister piece I can<br/>&gt;  find, more recently his Praeludium in G from the Halle<br/>&gt;  dissertation.  Most famously, the Christmas cantata Wo ist die<br/>&gt;  neugeborne Konig auf den Juden (PITCH 200202 Early).</p><p>This is the kind of detail and intimacy in studying any period that I<br/>deeply treasure and respect. I must admit that I&apos;m quite unfamiliar<br/>with this era, but your writing makes it intriguing. Of course,<br/>&quot;historically informed&quot; views can often differ -- as can views of<br/>contemporary writers in a given period also!</p><p>&gt;  Johnny: I suspect you have stretched ears.  Werckmeister actually<br/>&gt;  used the word Circul to indicate the difference between WIII and<br/>&gt;  WIV.  (Sorry everyone that the names of these prominent scales are<br/>&gt;  so arcane.)  What you like to hear, or consider sounding nice,<br/>&gt;  doesn&#xFFFD;t change the facts.  If one is allergic to dogs, even the<br/>&gt;  nicest, sweetest poodle would still cause an allergic response.</p><p>Here you make a _critical_ point: what someone like Vicentino,<br/>Werckmeister, or whoever writes _does_ tell us a lot about their<br/>viewpoint, and should be duly noted!</p><p>Thus Schlick clearly wanted his poodle (or Lehmanian &quot;prairie dog&quot;?)<br/>at Ab-Eb to be used, because that&apos;s the whole point of the compromise<br/>with Ab/G#. The idea is to have Ab-C-Eb usable as a sustained<br/>sonority, as he does in his organ composition, with Ab-C maybe similar<br/>to 12-EDO, while still being able to use E-G# at around Pythagorean<br/>for ornamented cadences to A. An allergy to Ab-Eb would defeat that<br/>purpose. So it appears that Schlick is a &quot;poodle-friendly&quot; tuning.</p><p>However, I seem to remember reading about someone around 1600<br/>suggesting that 3:2 is &quot;as wide as bearable,&quot; or the like, for a fifth<br/>-- which _would_ mean the kind of poodle allergy we&apos;re discussing.</p><p>&gt;  It may be one of the most amazing challenges, the ability to get<br/>&gt;  into someone&#xFFFD;s head.  Actors do it all the time.  Musicians are<br/>&gt;  often actors, usually the best of them.  Getting into the mind of a<br/>&gt;  long dead person through their writing may be toughest of all.  As<br/>&gt;  I said to Paul, I do not think the literature portends the full<br/>&gt;  story.  At best it is a part of the story.  The literature is more<br/>&gt;  interesting in its influence of later generations.</p><p>Please let me agree that while period literature, like any attempt to<br/>verbalize about music and musical taste, is necessarily incomplete, it<br/>is not unuseful. Thus reading Praetorius and Denis will at least alert<br/>me to the fact that they considered meantone F-G# a &quot;wolf&quot; or &quot;false<br/>minor third&quot; rather than &quot;a beautiful and near-pure 7:6.&quot; Thanks to<br/>Paul Poletti for reminding me that Praetorius discussed the use of the<br/>term &quot;wolf&quot; _specifically_ to mean this third.</p><p>In the early 14th-century Italy of Marchettus, 7:6 or so _may have_<br/>been a favored tuning of a cadential minor third contracting to a<br/>unison (e.g. C#-E resolving to D), but we can&apos;t be sure. Christopher<br/>Page concludes that it should often be considerably smaller than<br/>Pythagorean, but leaves the details to the singers.</p><p>[On my taste for wide fifths]</p><p>&gt;  Johnny: Exactly, you have stretched ears.  Me, too.  That&apos;s why I<br/>&gt;  recognize the condition.  It&apos;s no different than musicians being<br/>&gt;  over sensitive to sound in general.  We have stretched our minds in<br/>&gt;  to encompass dissonance as consonance.  The French take the just<br/>&gt;  third of 386 cents and recoil in horror at its dissonance<br/>&gt;  (anecdotal).</p><p>This is very true, and can affect my reactions both to the intervals<br/>themselves, and to seeing their sizes in cents: numbers like 274, 287,<br/>416, or 427 cents make me feel a certain affection for a tuning. Of<br/>course, I still know that these sizes should not be taken as freely<br/>interchangeable with meantone thirds &lt;grin&gt; -- although sometimes I<br/>try curious things anyway.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit like the question of parallel fifths, routine in a<br/>13th-century style, but generally excluded in a 16th-century style<br/>(apart from relaxed styles like certain dance settings and the<br/>villanella).</p><p>By the way, I recall some years ago playing in a usual 14th-century<br/>Pythagorean (Eb-G#) and hearing a diminished fourth (384 cents) as<br/>indeed something of a &quot;wolf.&quot; Acoustically, to borrow from Gertrude<br/>Stein, it may be true that &quot;a 5:4 is a 5:4 is a 5:4,&quot; and likewise<br/>&quot;a 7:6 is a 7:6 is a 7:6.&quot; In varying musical contexts, however, they<br/>can indeed sound different, fitting or otherwise.</p><p>&gt;   Your later comments: &quot;What I&apos;ve decided is that making new music<br/>&gt;   should be my first priority, and offering some curious<br/>&gt;   verbalizations about what I&apos;m up to, however imperfect and<br/>&gt;   incomplete, a good next priority&quot; make total sense as regards your<br/>&gt;   intervallic reactions.</p><p>This is a direction in which George Secor encouraged me during our<br/>very fruitful dialogue of 2001-2002 concerning his 17-tone<br/>well-temperament: seeking out to compose and explore an &quot;alternative<br/>history&quot; where the music would, he predicted, likely sound less and<br/>less like anything historically familiar.

And thank<br/>you for posting the mix of ratio and cents that  you retrieved from Scala.  The<br/>more information given, in all its guises,  the better for a full evaluation,<br/>not only of the truth, but of different errors  that are circulating.  This<br/>List is for exploration, not necessarily for  circulation.</p><p>The more I think of the literature, the less I  think is its percentage of<br/>full revelation of a historical musical  practice.  Besides the translation<br/>problems, and Werckmeister&apos;s  translations are more difficult in the regularly<br/>recurring Latin than in the  German, few tend to read what gets published.</p><p>Please correct me if warranted, but few read  Grammateus in his life time.<br/>Werckmeister, on the other hand, was  ingenious in getting his work published<br/>and distributed throughout the German  speaking world.  It would be interesting<br/>to list important writings on  tuning according to the category of<br/>dissemination.  More important, for  most, is the value place on the writings due to<br/>influence on later generations,  and here we might place Kirnberger.</p><p>Still, more important, much of musical action is  not written about in books,<br/>especially by musicians.  Note how few  microtonal musicians are on this<br/>List.  If you are unfamiliar with them, I  can make a list for you later.<br/>Musicians, as should be commonly  understood, regularly deal with the ineffable.<br/>Simply, they are not  verbal.  In this I am a notable exception.  (At Columbia I<br/>was called  by my advisor &quot;a talking chimpanzee.&quot;</p><p>&gt;Thus Schlick clearly wanted his  poodle (or Lehmanian &quot;prairie dog&quot;?)<br/>at Ab-Eb to be used, because that&apos;s the  whole point of the compromise<br/>with Ab/G#.

So it appears that Schlick is a &quot;poodle-friendly&quot;  tuning.</p><p>Margo, because I have been so busy teaching this  year, I had to pause on my<br/>Bach&apos;s Tuning work, sometimes finding myself  confused as to where I got<br/>something.  I had a source on Schlick where he  wrote of what to avoid and yearn to<br/>find it again.</p><p>Most dramatic in my college experiences was  taking a Renaissance music<br/>graduate course with Prof. Lippman at Columbia  University.  Lippman was known for<br/>his book on ancient Greek tuning.   When I appeared in his class, as an<br/>ethnomusicology grad student on fellowship,  I was asked to leave the class.  It had<br/>been determined that as an  ethnomusicologist, there would be no reason for<br/>me to be there.  Intervals  were to written on a blackboard in ratios.  When I<br/>brought in a Korg tuner  to play the intervals, they shuddered and shrank.</p><p>Now that I have the WIV numbers correctly  crunched thanks in part to my good<br/>friend at NYU, I see that there are 2 dogs at  710.

The 1/3-comma variation seems<br/>to fit this model -- at least if, like Costeley (1570) and Salinas<br/>(1577), we are ready to accept fifths tempered by this great a<br/>quantity, as in a regular 1/3-comma meantone or 19-EDO. Zarlino (1571)<br/>found 1/3-comma temperament &quot;languid,&quot; in contrast to either 1/4-comma<br/>or his own 2/7-comma -- but not, as I recall, outright unacceptable.</p><p>If one can bear with these fifths, then one advantage for usual<br/>diatonic transpositions (modal, or by this epoch tonal also) is that<br/>each of the seven major thirds formed from two _musica recta_ notes<br/>(the diatonic steps plus Bb) will be uniformly at 1/6-comma meantone<br/>quality -- except for E-G#, which will actually be a schisma closer to<br/>5:4 because of the &quot;schisma fifth&quot; in its chain at C#-G#.</p><p>At Eb-G we have a fifth at about 401 cents, considerably less than<br/>ideal but still tenable, in modes like G Dorian or F Lydian or Ionian,<br/>a compromise possibly rather like Schlick&apos;s (1511) with Ab-C.</p><p>The schisma adjustment of C#-G# in this 1/3-syntonic comma version may<br/>offer a small but notable advantage in pieces calling for B-D# as a<br/>usual major third: this third is a schisma smaller than Pythagorean,<br/>or around 406 cents, the size which Easley Blackwood has suggested may<br/>mark the limit for a stable major triad in a tonal style.</p><p>In contrast, C#-F, F#-Bb, and G#-C remain appreciably wider than<br/>Pythagorean, at about 413-415 cents, also the evident upper limit for<br/>major thirds or diminished fourths in Schlick&apos;s temperament and some<br/>versions of the temperament ordinaire in favor at the time of<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s treatise of 1681. Brad might note that the augmented<br/>fifth C-G# gives a nice approximation to a just 11:7, by the way --<br/>this is something that I look for, also.</p><p>These three diminished fourths would nicely fit their role as &quot;special<br/>effects&quot; intervals in meantone, and might sometimes be used as<br/>&quot;marginally interchangeable&quot; with more usual major thirds, as Mark<br/>Lindley describes in French keyboard music of Couperin. George Secor&apos;s<br/>modern temperament ordinaire also explores this territory.</p><p>However, if we take the main focus of Werckmeister IV to be a<br/>conventional diatonic style, then the 1/3-syntonic-comma variant does<br/>seem an attractive solution if one can accept this much temperament of<br/>the fifths, a la Costeley or Salinas.</p><p>Please let me conclude, Tom, by thanking you for your at once diligent<br/>and creative insight that Werckmeister&apos;s Septenarius temperament<br/>(Werckmeister VI) might better fit his own declared musical goals and<br/>standards if the monochord value printed as &quot;176&quot; were read as &quot;175.&quot;<br/>I looked at your proposal, and quickly saw how much sense it made!<br/>That gave me the idea of considering whether, if either a Pythagorean<br/>or a syntonic comma is a possible reading of Werckmeister&apos;s diagrams,<br/>an interpretation of the &quot;comma&quot; in Werckmeister IV as syntonic might<br/>not likewise promote his musical purposes.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2007 8:39:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo wrote (inter alia):</p><p>&gt; Brad, my warmest thanks to you as an artist and<br/>&gt; scholar who has brought to my attention the noble ingenuity of the<br/>&gt; temperament unit, and inspired me to seek creative by-ways for<br/>&gt; applying it.</p><p>You&apos;re welcome!

Anybody should<br/>get the *exactly* 3/7 of a syntonic comma answer, without having to<br/>calculate down to any of these units, or pick any amount of decimal<br/>round-off.  We&apos;ve taken 1/7 comma off each of four 5ths, such as<br/>C-G-D-A-E to build a C-E of some size.  There are therefore 3/7 of<br/>that comma remaining.  The major 3rd is therefore 3/7 of a syntonic<br/>comma sharp from 5:4.  Exactly.

There is<br/>nothing &quot;crippling&quot; about this.  It only answers a different type of<br/>question than you would pose to it.  Listening to a real organ or a<br/>real harpsichord, the normal listener is not going to give a flying<br/>fig how big the major 3rd is in absolute size, measured in any<br/>numerical units from bottom to top, either in some logarithmic units<br/>or as numerical frequencies per unit of time.  Rather, the perception<br/>(well, at least for me!) is: &quot;about how much&quot; is the interval<br/>wavering, being not quite on a pure integer ratio spot?  It&apos;s some<br/>amount sharp.  How much?  A little less than half a comma, or 3/7, or<br/>about 43%.  Or a smidge under size 5 on the 11-unit metric from Sorge<br/>et al, where 11 is a Pythagorean ditone, and a 12et major 3rd works<br/>out to exactly 7.  How big is the entire major 3rd on that 11-unit<br/>metric?  It&apos;s not designed to answer that question.  It&apos;s designed,<br/>rather, to tell us how many 1/11ths of a syntonic comma we&apos;re off from<br/>pure in a given major 3rd.  All the TU system does is multiply this by<br/>60, and it answers similar questions.</p><p>There exists a scale of Scoville Units to measure the pungency of<br/>chili peppers.<br/><a href="http://www.chemsoc.org/exemplarchem/entries/mbellringer/scoville.htm">http://www.chemsoc.org/exemplarchem/entries/mbellringer/scoville.htm</a><br/>But when you go to a restaurant and peruse the menu, does it give you<br/>any numerical measurements in Scoville units?  No, you get something<br/>like Mild, Medium, Spicy, and maybe a fourth option, and you pick one,<br/>and then the chef tries to give you something accordingly to the taste<br/>you said you wanted.  The chef probably doesn&apos;t even know or care what<br/>absolute number of Scoville units his dish would register, nor does<br/>the customer; only that it tastes enjoyable and as ordered.  Is the<br/>Mild-Medium-Spicy scale &quot;intellectual crippleware&quot;, or does it really<br/>help the customer get what he wants to eat?</p><p>Let&apos;s ask the flu system some question it&apos;s not designed to answer.<br/>How much is 1/3 of a major 3rd, in flus?  Well, let&apos;s see.  The entire<br/>major 3rd, presumably a pure 5:4, is (according to you) 14819 flus.<br/>And it&apos;s not evenly divisible by 3.  It comes out to a repeating<br/>decimal and can never be rounded off accurately!  Nor is 14819<br/>divisible by 2, 3, or 5.  It *is* divisible by 7 and 2117, so maybe<br/>the flu is designed to hack major 3rds into seven equal pieces?  What<br/>kind of system assigns a big unit that is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5,<br/>6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 but *only* by<br/>7?

Here are some preliminary<br/>comments from that.  These are all from working it by ear at the<br/>instrument, not calculating anything.</p><p>I set up regular 2/7 all the way around from Eb up to G#.  The major<br/>3rds are a little bit narrow, the minor 3rds (6:5) scarcely wide.  The<br/>F# to Bb, B to Eb, C# to F, and G# to C work out to hit almost on a<br/>9:7, and the F to G#, Bb to C#, Eb to F# are almost on 7:6.  With this<br/>installed I played through a bunch of random pages of medieval and<br/>Renaissance music, mostly vocal, from the _Historical Anthology of<br/>Music_ (HAM).  Margo&apos;s point, as I recall, is to set up something<br/>suitable for accompanying this type of repertoire.</p><p>Then I tried her recommendation of converting this to _temperament<br/>extraordinaire_ (her nomenclature, not mine; I&apos;d already co-opted the<br/>phrase &quot;extraordinary temperament&quot; to mean something different, a<br/>couple of years ago...).  That is: stretch F-Bb-Eb wide each, and<br/>F#-C#-G# wide each, so it eradicates the wolf G#-Eb and reduces it to<br/>four other lesser canines, all the same as one another.  In practice<br/>at harpsichord this is simply a process of cranking the Bb and Eb<br/>downward in turn, and the C# and G# upward in turn, until we have<br/>similar 5ths F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-E#.  They&apos;re all a little bit rougher than<br/>the 2/7 comma 5ths, and of course they&apos;re rough in the opposite<br/>direction, but given that all these 5ths/4th are growly anyway they<br/>don&apos;t sound too bad in context...playing them as open 5ths/4ths,<br/>without any 3rds (whether major or minor) in them.</p><p>But, does it work?  I played some more from HAM, some of the same<br/>compositions and some others randomly.  To the extent that the notes<br/>Bb, Eb, G#, and C# came up, which was rarely, they always stood out to<br/>me as not fitting their context when played in major or minor 3rds.<br/>Neither fish nor fowl.  Especially in the case of Bb, the most<br/>frequent of these four notes, it seemed to me there&apos;s too much<br/>difference in character between the Bb major triad and the F major<br/>triad, and between the A-Bb semitone vs the E-F semitone.  The Bb-D is<br/>scarcely wide as a major 3rd, and pleasant enough, but it doesn&apos;t have<br/>that tight center of gravity like the major 3rds on the naturals.<br/>Similarly, A-C# is only a little bit wide but it&apos;s lost its gravity.<br/>And Eb-G and E-G# are watered down even more, each.  They&apos;re still<br/>smaller than Pythagorean ditones and they&apos;re pleasant enough, in<br/>isolation, but they don&apos;t seem to fit their context.</p><p>Worse yet: we haven&apos;t really gained any usable B-D#, F#-A#, Ab-C, or<br/>Db-F.  They were kind of OK and attractive in their own way (while<br/>exotic) when they were hitting nearly 9:7, tuned regularly.  But now,<br/>having these modified 5ths, these misspelled major 3rds are in a<br/>no-man&apos;s-land.  They just sound like &quot;wrong notes&quot; giving nothing for<br/>my ear to grab onto, or to take me past the wincing.  I kept itching<br/>to put them back down (sharps) and up (flats) where they belong.</p><p>And in doing so, I found that I was presented with several viable<br/>places to put each of those stinkers Bb, Eb, C#, and G#.</p><p>Well, first, the Bb almost had to go back to its regular 2/7 position<br/>so it&apos;s not sticking out as mentioned above.</p><p>Having done that, there are four or five arguably decent places to put<br/>the others, all pretty close to one another when turning the tuning<br/>pin and sliding through all possibilities.</p><p>C#: back to its regular 2/7 comma place from F#, or tune it as a pure<br/>5:4 from A-C#, or tune it as pure 7:6 with Bb, or tune it as pure 9:7<br/>from F.  Or, simply as a pure 3:2 from F#.  All five of these spots<br/>are arguably good for C#.  Following Margo&apos;s lead I favored the two<br/>septimal spots.  Why hit only near a 7:6 or a 9:7 when you can hit<br/>directly on one of them?  It makes the minor triads, diminished<br/>triads, and tritones lock in that way, too.</p><p>G# similarly has four or five spots: its 2/7 comma tempering from C#<br/>(before we moved C#), or as 5:4, 7:6, 9:7, or 3:2 from its neighbors.</p><p>And Eb similarly has those options with respect to Bb, B, F#, and G.</p><p>All of this writes off the G#-Eb wolf as a loss...but it&apos;s not going<br/>to come up in this medieval and Renaissance music anyway.  And by<br/>going back to regular 2/7, or nearly so (choosing septimal placements<br/>on C#, G#, and Eb), we&apos;ve got a fantastic set of eleven minor triads,<br/>eight tightly attractive major triads, three septimal major triads,<br/>and all the other related emoluments.  The 5ths F#-C#-G# and Eb-Bb<br/>work out decently (for context) no matter what we do, given that the<br/>2/7 comma 5ths on the naturals are already rough.</p><p>If the point is to accompany medieval or Renaissance [vocal] music,<br/>regular 2/7 works better (at least for me) than the 5th-stretching<br/>_extraordinaire_ step does.  If the point was to get those septimal<br/>resonances going, why move off them by widening the 5ths?</p><p>I could change my mind tomorrow, but that&apos;s how I hear it today.  And<br/>all of this might work better (or worse?) on organ as opposed to<br/>harpsichord.  On harpsichord, at least, the septimal intervals are<br/>clear and pungent.</p><p>And if the notes D#, A#, Ab, and Db aren&apos;t going to come up in the<br/>music anyway...why not just stick with regular 1/4 instead of 2/7?<br/>It&apos;s sort of a trade-off here between the major 3rds and minor 3rds.<br/>But if we wanted pure minor 3rds, why not go all the way to 1/3 comma<br/>then?  2/7 goes down between these, giving the strengths of both...and<br/>because those 3rds aren&apos;t pure, they&apos;re (arguably) more attractive<br/>just by virtue of being livelier, not sitting there dead-on.

And by<br/>&gt; going back to regular 2/7, or nearly so (choosing septimal<br/>&gt; placements on C#, G#, and Eb), we&apos;ve got a fantastic set of eleven<br/>&gt; minor triads, eight tightly attractive major triads, three septimal<br/>&gt; major triads, and all the other related emoluments.  The 5ths<br/>&gt; F#-C#-G# and Eb-Bb work out decently (for context) no matter what we<br/>&gt; do, given that the 2/7 comma 5ths on the naturals are already rough.</p><p>Here I consider this kind of empirically fine-tuned solution as a<br/>creative side of things that must have often shaped the historical<br/>temperaments that are now all too easy to approach mainly as neat<br/>mathematical constructs.</p><p>I&apos;m honored to have played some role in this process, and would like<br/>to say so in a short post where your new variation, admirably suited<br/>to historical Renaissance music, can enjoy center stage.</p><p>In a longer post, I&apos;ve responded to your comments about the<br/>_temperament extraordinaire_ at some length, and mainly to clarify<br/>that this system is meant mainly for _new music_ which mixes or<br/>alternates Renaissance styles using meantone colors in the nearer<br/>portion of the circle with medieval or especially neomedieval<br/>styles using modes transposed to the remote portion of the circle<br/>with its large major and small minor thirds. This is a kind of<br/>21st-century manneristic tuning, combining two very different<br/>styles of intonation in one 12-note circle, with many inevitable,<br/>striking, and hopefully artful distortions.</p><p>However, your septimal refinement of a usual 2/7-comma has the great<br/>advantage for period performances of leaving the usual meantone<br/>structure intact while gently optimizing 7:6 and 9:7.

For example:</p><p>                  F  -   Bb  -  Eb  -  G#<br/>                  regular regular  Wolf</p><p>Now we know that the net tempering of those three fifths has to be<br/>equal to the septimal comma or Comma of Archytas (thanks to George<br/>Secor for the latter name!) at 64:63, 27.26 cents, or 836.75 TU.<br/>More specifically, this net temperament of the fifths must be in<br/>the wide direction.</p><p>Let&apos;s take that as an even 837 TU for most practical purposes. If we<br/>use &quot;t&quot; for the temperament of the regular fifths (the unknown to be<br/>found), and &quot;w&quot; for the impurity of the Wolf fifth in the wide<br/>direction (&quot;w&quot; standing for either Wolf or wide), we have:</p><p>            w - 2t = 837</p><p>Next, let us consider the relationship between t and w. If we take t<br/>as the amount by which regular fifths are tempered narrow, and a<br/>positive value for w to mean the amount by which the Wolf fifth is<br/>wide of a pure 3:2, then we have:</p><p>            w = 11t - 720</p><p>This means that we take the total amount of negative temperament done<br/>by the 11 regular meantone fifths, and subtract 720 (the Pythagorean<br/>comma) to find out the amount by which the Wolf exceeds 3:2, and so<br/>can contribute toward a septimal size for an augmented second like<br/>F-G#.</p><p>Now, substituting our second equation for the size of the Wolf fifth<br/>into the first concerning the net temperament of F-G#, we have:</p><p>            11t - 720 - 2t = 837</p><p>This simplifies to:</p><p>            9t - 720 = 837</p><p>and further to:</p><p>            9t = 1557</p><p>and thus:</p><p>             t = 173</p><p>This seems intuitively a reasonable result, since we know that<br/>1/4-comma at 165 TU comes very close, but with F-G# a bit larger than<br/>a just 7:6. This is a regular fifth at about 696.32 cents, or 5.64<br/>cents wide, as an approximation based on 837 TU for the septimal<br/>comma.</p><p>It would be more accurate to do the same calculation with a value of<br/>836.75 TU for this comma.

Here are some preliminary<br/>&gt; comments from that.  These are all from working it by ear at the<br/>&gt; instrument, not calculating anything.</p><p>Dear Brad,</p><p>Thank you again for devoting this kind of creative energy to a tuning<br/>system in a very hands-on way, exploring its nuances and indeed<br/>customizing it to your own very experienced tastes.</p><p>In my response, I&apos;ll try to keep to this spirit by avoiding too much<br/>mathematical complexity and focusing on the sound of the intervals and<br/>their intended musical effect. Your impressions are fascinating to<br/>read, and come from someone who can illuminate all kinds of practical<br/>angles that my experience simply doesn&apos;t cover.</p><p>While it appears that our recipes for tuning the _extraordinaire_ may<br/>have varied a bit, as explained below, most of your comments are<br/>equally applicable to my recipe. They neatly highlight some aspects of<br/>the tuning, and questions about its purpose, which I&apos;ll try to address<br/>here, and ask for your feedback on how well I&apos;m doing.</p><p>I&apos;ve decided to rewrite my original long response, because I realize<br/>that the biggest issue needing clarification here may be the _purpose_<br/>of the tuning. As will appear below, it is a hybrid circulating system<br/>meant mainly for _new_ music often alternating between or juxtaposing<br/>Renaissance/Manneristic meantone styles in the nearer portion of the<br/>cycle with medieval or especially neomedieval styles using transposed<br/>modes focusing on the remote portion of the circle.</p><p>Here&apos;s a piece I did in a mostly 16th-century style emphasizing the<br/>nearer portion of the circle, with a few septimal touches:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Here are some neomedieval pieces and improvisations focusing on the<br/>remote portion of the circle:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/InHoraObservationis.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/InHoraObservationis.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/OElsa.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/OElsa.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Following your admirable lead of giving first place to actual sound<br/>and musical experience, I&apos;m offering this sample of how the<br/>_temperament extraordinaire_ sounds with music designed for or adapted<br/>to it. In some of what follows, I&apos;ll refer back to these pieces to<br/>illustrate some of your very well-taken points and explain why I find<br/>certain compromises acceptable or even attractive for my purposes --<br/>but not necessarily for others!</p><p>&gt; I set up regular 2/7 all the way around from Eb up to G#.  The major<br/>&gt; 3rds are a little bit narrow, the minor 3rds (6:5) scarcely wide.<br/>&gt; The F# to Bb, B to Eb, C# to F, and G# to C work out to hit almost<br/>&gt; on a 9:7, and the F to G#, Bb to C#, Eb to F# are almost on 7:6.</p><p>Brad, you&apos;ve hit on one of the attractions of 2/7-comma: if the idea<br/>is to optimize both 9:7 and 7:6, this is a &quot;sweet spot.&quot; A small<br/>clarification: in 2/7-comma, the minor thirds are also &quot;a little bit<br/>narrow&quot; of 6:5, as you have noted the major ones are of 5:4.</p><p>&gt; With this installed I played through a bunch of random pages of<br/>&gt; medieval and Renaissance music, mostly vocal, from the _Historical<br/>&gt; Anthology of Music_ (HAM).  Margo&apos;s point, as I recall, is to set up<br/>&gt; something suitable for accompanying this type of repertoire.</p><p>For Renaissance music, I would indeed say that a regular 2/7-comma (or<br/>1/4-comma) is hard to outdo, in comparison to _any_ 12-note<br/>circulating scheme! For medieval music, I&apos;d likewise recommend the<br/>usual period tuning of a regular Pythagorean -- or possibly, for a<br/>discreetly &quot;modern&quot; variation, something like Peppermint where all<br/>regular fifths are a tad more than 2 cents (66 TU) wide of 3:2.</p><p>My circle, in comparison, can hardly be ideal if we are aiming<br/>consistently for either type of period sound. As compared with a<br/>regular meantone, some very important pure or near-pure thirds are<br/>compromised; as compared with Pythagorean or even a modern variant<br/>such as the gentle Peppermint, the fifths are impure by 6-7 cents!<br/>This will come out more in your remarks below and my responses.</p><p>The purpose the _temperament extraordinaire_, rather, is primarily to<br/>accommodate new music which is free to transpose any mode to any step,<br/>or cadence on any of the 12 fifths, suiting the style to a given<br/>region of the circle -- now Renaissance meantone, now neomedieval,<br/>sometimes with striking transitional colors or &quot;fringe effects.&quot;</p><p>Actually I _do_ use this tuning for playing historical Renaissance<br/>pieces in the nearer portion of the circle (Bb-G#, with Eb calling for<br/>discretion as discussed below), and like the result -- but a regular<br/>meantone would, as you note, be more idiomatic and consistent both<br/>harmonically and melodically with a period ethos.</p><p>&gt; Then I tried her recommendation of converting this to _temperament<br/>&gt; extraordinaire_ (her nomenclature, not mine; I&apos;d already co-opted<br/>&gt; the phrase &quot;extraordinary temperament&quot; to mean something different,<br/>&gt; a couple of years ago...).</p><p>Please let me join you in noting the difference between the French<br/>term _temperament extraordinaire_, which I&apos;ve been using since 2003<br/>&lt;<a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/43016">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/43016</a>&gt; to<br/>describe a modified 1/4-comma or 2/7-comma meantone with eight narrow<br/>and four equally wide fifths; and &quot;Bach&apos;s Extraordinary Temperament,&quot;<br/>the title of your articles of 2005.</p><p>I&apos;ve never thought of translating my French term literally into<br/>English, and your personal trademark now clearly stamped on the phrase<br/>&quot;extraordinary temperament&quot; is another reason not to do so.</p><p>&gt; That is: stretch F-Bb-Eb wide each, and F#-C#-G# wide each, so it<br/>&gt; eradicates the wolf G#-Eb and reduces it to four other lesser<br/>&gt; canines, all the same as one another.  In practice at harpsichord<br/>&gt; this is simply a process of cranking the Bb and Eb downward in turn,<br/>&gt; and the C# and G# upward in turn, until we have similar 5ths<br/>&gt; F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-E#.</p><p>Please let me clarify that my recipe for the _extraordinaire_ is a bit<br/>different in that only three notes are adjusted: Bb, Eb, and G#. The<br/>following diagram using our beloved TU may make this clearer:</p><p>F    C    G    D    A    E    B    F#    C#    G#    D#/Eb   A#     F<br/> -189 -189 -189 -189 -189 -189 -189  -189  +198  +198    +198  +198</p><p>One aural recipe for use at the harpsichord might be to tune the eight<br/>fifths F-C# in a regular 2/7-comma, thus setting nine of the 12 notes.<br/>Then, _without changing any of these notes_, temper G#, D#/Eb, and Bb<br/>so that the near-9:7 major third or diminished fourth C#/Db-F already<br/>set is derived from a chain of four equally wide fifths.</p><p>Specifically, in my recipe, C# is not adjusted, so that A-C# stays a<br/>regular meantone third and C#/Db-F stays at its near-9:7 size. This<br/>changes the details of the compromises involved, but not their basic<br/>nature, which you well describe.</p><p>You make a very important point about the wide fifths:</p><p>&gt; They&apos;re all a little bit rougher than the 2/7 comma 5ths, and of<br/>&gt; course they&apos;re rough in the opposite direction, but given that all<br/>&gt; these 5ths/4th are growly anyway they don&apos;t sound too bad in<br/>&gt; context...playing them as open 5ths/4ths, without any 3rds (whether<br/>&gt; major or minor) in them.</p><p>Thank you for this invaluable aural feedback, which for me is really a<br/>critical point: in a medieval or neomedieval styles with their remote<br/>modal transpositions, those wide fifths are indeed going continually<br/>to be used as stable consonances without any thirds, in this context<br/>definitely unstable intervals.</p><p>&gt; But, does it work?  I played some more from HAM, some of the same<br/>&gt; compositions and some others randomly. To the extent that the notes<br/>&gt; Bb, Eb, G#, and C# came up, which was rarely, they always stood out<br/>&gt; to me as not fitting their context when played in major or minor<br/>&gt; 3rds.  Neither fish nor fowl.  Especially in the case of Bb, the<br/>&gt; most frequent of these four notes, it seemed to me there&apos;s too much<br/>&gt; difference in character between the Bb major triad and the F major<br/>&gt; triad, and between the A-Bb semitone vs the E-F semitone.</p><p>Here I might be curious as to whether these were mainly medieval or<br/>Renaissance pieces from HAM, or some mixture. I&apos;ll focus here on a<br/>Renaissance style, since typically with medieval pieces I would make<br/>remote transpositions (e.g. D Dorian to Eb or Bb) that would bring<br/>other intervals and issues into play, some addressed below.</p><p>So that people can hear some of the things you discuss in relation<br/>both to altered third sizes and melodic semitones in a Renaissance<br/>meantone kind of style, here&apos;s a link repeated for convenience to my<br/>_Intrada in F Lydian_, which prominently uses lots of the accidentals<br/>and intervals you mention. Apart from the matter of C#, which as I<br/>noted is not modified in my recipe, all of your comments apply:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Thus while usual meantone thirds are at 383 cents, a tad narrow of 5:4<br/>as you have said, Bb-D is around 396 cents, and Bb-D-F often occurs<br/>close to a near-pure sonority such as F-A-C or D-F#-A. While I might<br/>call this &quot;a stimulating touch of modal color,&quot; it&apos;s definitely a<br/>compromise for a period sound where the uniformly pure or near-pure<br/>thirds of regular meantone are the norm.</p><p>Also, the major third Eb-G, used here in the sixth sonority Eb-G-C, is<br/>actually at 408 cents a tad larger than Pythagorean; while I much like<br/>the color of this sonority and also C-Eb-G in a Renaissance as well as<br/>neomedieval context, it is in the former setting a dramatic departure<br/>from the smooth 5:4 sound again offered by a regular meantone.</p><p>Your point about the different melodic sizes of A-Bb and E-F is also<br/>right on. While E-F is a regular 2/7-comma semitone at 121 cents, the<br/>altered A-Bb is about 108 cents (comparable to 1/5-1/6 comma), while<br/>Eb-D, featured in some cadences, is 96 cents. One can relish this<br/>variegation, or have more mixed feelings, but it is again a departure<br/>from a regular meantone where all these steps would be 121 cents.</p><p>&gt; The Bb-D is scarcely wide as a major 3rd, and pleasant enough, but<br/>&gt; it doesn&apos;t have that tight center of gravity like the major 3rds on<br/>&gt; the naturals.</p><p>Certainly the different is there -- 384 vs. 396 cents. From a<br/>21st-century perspective, I might argue that in a Renaissance kind of<br/>style with restful thirds, Bb is a less likely modal final than the<br/>naturals (other than B), and so, in a circulating system, can better<br/>afford some compromise. However, that argument is double-edged, as<br/>will appear shortly! In any event, for a period sound, regular<br/>meantone would, of course, leave Bb-D near-pure like the naturals.</p><p>&gt; Similarly, A-C# is only a little bit wide but it&apos;s lost<br/>&gt; its gravity.  And Eb-G and E-G# are watered down even more, each.<br/>&gt; They&apos;re still smaller than Pythagorean ditones and they&apos;re pleasant<br/>&gt; enough, in isolation, but they don&apos;t seem to fit their context.</p><p>While A-C# is in my scheme unaltered, what you say about it definitely<br/>could apply to E-G# at 396 cents, the &quot;double edge&quot; of my possible<br/>argument regarding Bb-D, since E _is_ a natural, and the untransposed<br/>final for one of my favorite modes, E Phrygian, which comes up<br/>continually. While some other things are going in the piece which<br/>follows, I&apos;d like people to hear the compromise of closing in Phrygian<br/>on that 396-cent third, which I accept, but wouldn&apos;t happen in a<br/>regular 2/7-comma:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Invocation-ToneIV.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/Invocation-ToneIV.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Worse yet: we haven&apos;t really gained any usable B-D#, F#-A#, Ab-C, or<br/>&gt; Db-F.  They were kind of OK and attractive in their own way (while<br/>&gt; exotic) when they were hitting nearly 9:7, tuned regularly.  But<br/>&gt; now, having these modified 5ths, these misspelled major 3rds are in<br/>&gt; a no-man&apos;s-land.  They just sound like &quot;wrong notes&quot; giving nothing<br/>&gt; for my ear to grab onto, or to take me past the wincing.</p><p>Certainly I&apos;d agree, as a septimal fan myself, that having only one<br/>near-9:7 major third at Db-F, rather than four, is a compromise --<br/>although one not so unpleasant for me, since in a neomedieval setting<br/>I also relish thirds around 408 or 421 cents, or anywhere along the<br/>spectrum from Pythagorean to septimal. This can be very much a matter<br/>of taste, with one person&apos;s &quot;pleasantly variegated neomedieval thirds&quot;<br/>being another person&apos;s &quot;wrong notes.&quot;</p><p>This more remote terrain in the circle is rather like a distinctively<br/>modern circle of another kind: a 17-tone well-temperament such as<br/>George Secor&apos;s of 1978, with major thirds at 418-429 cents. While<br/>Marchettus of Padua (1318) and the modern scholar and performer of<br/>medieval music Christopher Page provide a basis for concluding that<br/>thirds of around this size may have occurred in 14th-century<br/>performances of vocal music, this is above all a 20th-21st century<br/>keyboard concept rather than an historical one!</p><p>Why don&apos;t I repeat for convenience the links to neomedieval pieces so<br/>that people can hear these thirds at 408 and 421 as well as 434 cents.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/MMMYear001.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/InHoraObservationis.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/InHoraObservationis.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/OElsa.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/OElsa.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>It might not hurt for me to emphasize that these thirds are generally<br/>intended for use in a neomedieval context where they contrast with and<br/>often expand to stable fifths; or in a Renaissance context as meantone<br/>diminished fourths (B-Eb, C#-F, F#-Bb, G#-C). Apart from Eb-G at about<br/>408 cents or Pythagorean, which I might use in a meantone setting in<br/>Eb-G-C or C-Eb-G, they are _not_ meant for use in a Renaissance style<br/>as usual thirds.</p><p>Also, your remarks point to a basic consequence of circulation. The<br/>extreme values for major thirds, 383 and 434 cents, or very close to<br/>5:4 and 9:7, are identical to those in a regular 2/7-comma. However,<br/>averaging out that Wolf fifth into four wide fifths results also in<br/>the intermediate values of 396, 408, and 421 cents. While I like these<br/>intermediate shades, they inevitably result in fewer major thirds at<br/>either extreme, at a near-just 5:4 or 9:7.</p><p>[On your own preferred modification of 2/7-comma]</p><p>&gt; C#: back to its regular 2/7 comma place from F#, or tune it as a<br/>&gt; pure 5:4 from A-C#, or tune it as pure 7:6 with Bb, or tune it as<br/>&gt; pure 9:7 from F.  Or, simply as a pure 3:2 from F#.  All five of<br/>&gt; these spots are arguably good for C#.  Following Margo&apos;s lead I<br/>&gt; favored the two septimal spots.  Why hit only near a 7:6 or a 9:7<br/>&gt; when you can hit directly on one of them?  It makes the minor<br/>&gt; triads, diminished triads, and tritones lock in that way, too.</p><p>This is very creative: to take my septimal theme, but realize it in a<br/>different way that leaves the tuning quite close to its regular<br/>historical form! I wonder if your having altered C# in your version of<br/>the _extraordinaire_ recipe for circulation might have facilitated<br/>this happy result.</p><p>&gt; All of this writes off the G#-Eb wolf as a loss...but it&apos;s not going<br/>&gt; to come up in this medieval and Renaissance music anyway.</p><p>Here the different, of course, is that for my remote neomedieval<br/>transpositions Ab-Eb is going to come up all the time in Ab Mixolydian<br/>or Eb Dorian or Gb Lydian, etc. Where this kind of circulation isn&apos;t<br/>relevant, however, your solution very subtly optimizes the septimal<br/>intervals while leaving the smooth Renaissance meantone color<br/>undisturbed.</p><p>&gt; And by going back to regular 2/7, or nearly so (choosing septimal<br/>&gt; placements on C#, G#, and Eb), we&apos;ve got a fantastic set of eleven<br/>&gt; minor triads, eight tightly attractive major triads, three septimal<br/>&gt; major triads, and all the other related emoluments.  The 5ths<br/>&gt; F#-C#-G# and Eb-Bb work out decently (for context) no matter what we<br/>&gt; do, given that the 2/7 comma 5ths on the naturals are already rough.</p><p>It&apos;s wonderful that your exploration led you to this happy conclusion<br/>bearing your own distinctive stamp!</p><p>&gt; If the point is to accompany medieval or Renaissance [vocal] music,<br/>&gt; regular 2/7 works better (at least for me) than the 5th-stretching<br/>&gt; _extraordinaire_ step does.  If the point was to get those septimal<br/>&gt; resonances going, why move off them by widening the 5ths?</p><p>Another way of phrasing this question: &quot;What price circulation?&quot; If I<br/>wanted to play in a Renaissance style around the circle, it wouldn&apos;t<br/>make sense. If something like Ab-C-Eb did occur, say in Schlick or an<br/>extended meantone piece assuming more than 12 notes per octave, having<br/>Ab-C at 421 cents would be just as much a barrier as a Wolf at G#-Eb.</p><p>The answer is neomedieval styles in remote transpositions -- at the<br/>cost of fewer septimal resonances: Db-F at a near-9:7 as in the<br/>regular meantone, plus F-Ab and Bb-Db at around 275 cents, or not too<br/>far from 7:6. Now we have a 12-note circle where Bb-Db-F, for example,<br/>can cadence beautifully to Ab-Eb in Ab Dorian or Mixolydian, say. I&apos;m<br/>quite happy with Eb-Gb and C-Eb at 287 cents also, another favorite<br/>size, so it&apos;s an amenable compromise to me -- but still a compromise!</p><p>In short, from the viewpoint of septimal optimizations, I&apos;d consider<br/>this one of the best 12-note circulating systems -- but not so good as<br/>a regular meantone!</p><p>&gt; I could change my mind tomorrow, but that&apos;s how I hear it today.<br/>&gt; And all of this might work better (or worse?) on organ as opposed to<br/>&gt; harpsichord.  On harpsichord, at least, the septimal intervals are<br/>&gt; clear and pungent.</p><p>Again, thank you for your honesty and directness, as well as your<br/>experience and musical sensitivity. You also bring up an interesting<br/>question regarding timbres: do I tend to select timbres on<br/>synthesizer, for example (which I often consider a kind of organ)<br/>where major thirds at 421 cents, say, might have a different effect<br/>than on harpsichord? Anyway, I&apos;m delighted that your septimal<br/>variation fits your instrument well.</p><p>&gt; And if the notes D#, A#, Ab, and Db aren&apos;t going to come up in the<br/>&gt; music anyway...why not just stick with regular 1/4 instead of 2/7?<br/>&gt; It&apos;s sort of a trade-off here between the major 3rds and minor 3rds.<br/>&gt; But if we wanted pure minor 3rds, why not go all the way to 1/3<br/>&gt; comma then?  2/7 goes down between these, giving the strengths of<br/>&gt; both...and because those 3rds aren&apos;t pure, they&apos;re (arguably) more<br/>&gt; attractive just by virtue of being livelier, not sitting there<br/>&gt; dead-on.  Every listener might of course have a different opinion<br/>&gt; about that.</p><p>Your appreciation of 2/7-comma may be rather like mine: a certain<br/>balance for major and minor thirds with both gently beating. Also, I<br/>love those just 25:24 minor semitones (kept at C-C# and F-F# in my<br/>_extraordinaire_). They&apos;re beautiful in 16th-century chromatic<br/>progressions, and excellent as regular neomedieval semitones, very<br/>close to George Secor&apos;s ideal size of around 67 cents.</p><p>Please forgive the length of my response, but take it as a measure of<br/>how thoughtful and significant I find your comments.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2007 9:35:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Happily I find that the TU is a good tool to solve this problem, and<br/>&gt; will try to explain my process for solving it in a reasonably<br/>&gt; comprehensible way, I hope.<br/>&gt; (...)<br/>&gt;              t = 173</p><p>Margo rocks.

Maybe the<br/>ways we&apos;ve each used it might give curious clues about us &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Brad and George, I might say that for each of you, the aspect of the<br/>tuning that makes it _extraordinaire_ might be rather subtle.</p><p>Brad, I very much enjoy your explanation of how the essence of the<br/>&quot;extraordinary&quot; in your usage is having E-G#, traditionally a regular<br/>meantone major third, smaller than Ab-C, traditionally a diminished<br/>fourth -- a heritage reflected in many well-temperaments, and also in<br/>the French _ordinaire_ where the fifths tempered wide tend to be on<br/>the flat side (e.g. Ab-Eb-Bb-F in a very simple modification of<br/>regular 1/5-comma, say). As developed in your reconstruction of Bach&apos;s<br/>temperament, the idea that E-G# should be larger than Ab-C has some<br/>fascinating ramifications.</p><p>George, while any tuning system you design is likely to be<br/>&quot;extraordinary,&quot; your _extraordinaire_ seems especially so in the<br/>matter of coordinated beat rates. Again, this is a very subtle but<br/>musically significant detail, a mark of craftspersonship possibly more<br/>notable for its depth than its flamboyance.</p><p>In contrast, my _extraordinaire_ seems rather less refined. Take a<br/>regular 1/4-comma or 2/7-comma meantone in 12 notes (Eb-G#), and<br/>simply distribute the Wolf equally over four wide fifths, leaving F-C#<br/>as is. The _extraordinaire_ aspect is not some fine nuance in the<br/>gradation of sharps and flats, or some pleasant synchrony of beat<br/>rates, but the sheer &quot;colorfulness&quot; of the thing: major thirds at<br/>386-427 cents and minor thirds at 279-310 cents in 1/4-comma; and<br/>respective ranges of 383-434 cents and 275-313 cents in 2/7-comma.</p><p>Of course, in March 2003 or now, to get excited about something like<br/>this you have to a certain curious sensibility: for example,<br/>applauding interval sizes like 421 cents as &quot;delicious.&quot; But the idea<br/>of my &quot;extraordinaire&quot; is mostly having a full spectrum of thirds<br/>running most if not all of the way from 5-limit through Pythagorean<br/>through 14:11 or 13:11 country and beyond to septimal.</p><p>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/42903">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/42903</a></p><p>&gt;  She indicates that she likes major and minor 3rds that approximate<br/>&gt;  11:14 and 11:13, respectively.

A<br/>distinction might be that yours does this as part of a very subtle<br/>balance within the circle.

That<br/>might also be influenced by how the two of you approach your own<br/>usages of &quot;extraordinare&quot; and &quot;extraordinary.&quot;</p><p>By the way, Brad, I must say that your dialogue with me about your<br/>2/7-comma harpsichord experiments has been most educational for me,<br/>and makes me resolve to strive for accounts of these spectrum tunings<br/>as lucid as yours about &quot;extraordinary&quot; ones.

This is not the case with a single size<br/>fifth, in which they&apos;re approximate.  Exact proportional beat rates<br/>tend to make the beating sound more unified (or periodic), like a<br/>vibrato, as if the instrument is &quot;singing&quot;.  With non-proportional<br/>beating, the interactions between the differing beat rates sounds<br/>more disturbing.</p><p>And if part of your definition of<br/>&gt; &quot;rationalization&quot; includes the use rational numbers instead of a<br/>more<br/>&gt; precise method of representation, then it would have been 7209/4819<br/>or<br/>&gt; 27542/18411, or even 868220/580379... though I don&apos;t see the point<br/>in<br/>&gt; this archaic methodology. Rather like doing dental surgery with a<br/>shot<br/>&gt; of whiskey, a pair of pliers and a soldering iron.</p><p>The rational numbers are precise, i.e., they result in *exact*<br/>proportional beat rates within the various triads.  The rational<br/>approximations to the irrational number you suggested are inexact.</p><p>&gt; &gt; A key feature of the _extraordinaire_ (as I use the term) is the<br/>&lt;1/4-<br/>&gt; &gt; comma tempering of the narrowest fifths.  In the 5/23-comma<br/>version,<br/>&gt; &gt; the fifths in the root-position C and G major triads beat at the<br/>same<br/>&gt; &gt; rate as the major 3rds, which hides the beating of the major<br/>3rds --<br/>&gt; &gt; so it sounds as if the major 3rds are just (as in 1/4-comma<br/>&gt; &gt; meantone), while the narrowest 5ths (tempered &lt;4.7 cents) beat<br/>more<br/>&gt; &gt; slowly than in 1/4-comma meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Umm, I tried this temperament this morning in Absynth using both<br/>&gt; Goerge&apos;s values and re-rationalized values with constant fifths,<br/>with<br/>&gt; both a regal sound and a sampled Silbermann open diapason, and I<br/>don&apos;t<br/>&gt; find that there is any &quot;masking&quot; to speak of. I still hear both the<br/>&gt; thirds and the fifths beating, and the thirds certainly do NOT sound<br/>&gt; like the pure thirds of straight-up meantone. Granted, the fifths<br/>&gt; don&apos;t beat as fast, but I think the claims about the thirds are<br/>inflated.</p><p>The thirds beat if they are sounded separately, but within a triad<br/>they&apos;re masked by the beating fifths, because the beat rate of both<br/>is the same.  I think it&apos;s preferable to have both intervals beat at<br/>the same rate, as opposed to one beatless and the other beating,<br/>because the contrast in beating vs. beatless intervals tends to make<br/>the beating more conspicuous.</p><p>You need to compare the C and G triads in the ~5/23-comma rational<br/>temperament (not an oxymoron!) with 1/4-comma meantone temperament<br/>(which also has proportional-beating triads, BTW).  The question to<br/>ask is whether one sounds better than the other.  If the difference<br/>is judged to be very small or insignificant, then the rational<br/>temperament will be a better choice as a starting point for a<br/>circulating temperament, because there will be less total error on<br/>the far side of the circle of fifths.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In a nutshell, that&apos;s what makes it<br/>&gt; &gt; _extraordinaire_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What?! All this mucking about with numbers just for TWO major chords<br/>&gt; that display this supposedly extra-ordinary characteristic, and only<br/>&gt; when played in root position?<br/>&gt;</p><p>No, and no.  The major-3rd-to-fifth beating for those two triads is<br/>1:1 in all (close) triad positions, except that you need to<br/>substitute the fourth for the fifth and (for the 1st inversion) the<br/>minor 6th for the major 3rd.</p><p>In the other major triads the proportions are different, yet still<br/>fairly simple; e.g., the ratio of the minor-3rd-to-major-3rd rates is<br/>2:1 in the E and F major triads and 3:1 in D major.  In the minor<br/>triads the proportions are not quite as simple, but the effect is<br/>still better than if the ratios between the rates are unplanned<br/>(i.e., haphazard).</p><p>&gt; Oh well, I guess it IS the era of<br/>&gt; reduced expectations...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; :-(</p><p>Or an era of increasing explanations. :-)</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@polettipiano.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2007 4:54:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.

Can&apos;t help with Open Office, I&apos;m afraid.</p><p>My main objection to TU is that they are absurdly and spuriously tiny<br/>for any realistic acoustic situation. What is the point of an<br/>organbuilder using a unit which is probably at least ten times smaller<br/>than any interval he could reliably or usefully adjust his temperament<br/>by? Thinking in TU carries a great risk of attributing a<br/>pseudo-scientific precision to what is, in reality, the rather messy,<br/>unpredictable and artistic process of actually tuning organ pipes.</p><p>Didn&apos;t Brad tell us not too long ago about tuning a small organ for<br/>continuo accompaniment ... one of the remarks there was that the<br/>reading on an electronic pitch meter was chronically unstable, and<br/>thus useless for calibration or setting temperament, and this was a<br/>normal situation for certain types of register. Also, I know that if<br/>one tunes the pipe with the lid of the portative organ off, then<br/>replaces the lid, some relevant intervals may change noticeably -<br/>probably by dozens of TU. So what use are TU there? Can one ever hear<br/>or control *one* TU?</p><p>Cents have probably stayed in use partly because they do correspond<br/>quite closely to the minimum audible difference between intervals in<br/>some relevant situations - for example tuning fifths on a keyboard<br/>instrument.</p><p>By the way, my solution was as follows. Nine fifths F-G# have to have<br/>a total (flatwards) tempering of one comma plus 64/63. In my<br/>third-(syntonic)-comma / septimal scheme that is seven steps, since<br/>64/63 is represented by 4/3 comma. Hence the tempering of each fifth<br/>is one-ninth of 7/3 comma, ie 7/27 (syntonic) comma. So far, not a<br/>single logarithm or decimal in sight...

You don&apos;t need any electronic device to see it, either.<br/>Just compare the sound of any pipe to an electronically generated tone<br/>(with a reasonable amount of harmonics) by listening to the pipe<br/>through a pair of non-isolating headphones. The slight wavers produced<br/>by random phase shifting is readily audible.</p><p>Furthermore, don&apos;t forget that the frequency of a pipe changes by<br/>about 3 cents for every degree C of temperature! So you&apos;d better move<br/>fast when tuning an organ. See:</p><p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/waves/opecol.html">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/waves/opecol.html</a></p><p>BTW, I don&apos;t know what sort of &quot;electronic pitch meter&quot; Brad uses, but<br/>if it is a Korg, forget it! Those things are utterly worthless,<br/>inherently unstable, and so poorly programmed that even the octaves<br/>are often out of tune.</p><p>&gt; Also, I know that if<br/>&gt; one tunes the pipe with the lid of the portative organ off, then<br/>&gt; replaces the lid, some relevant intervals may change noticeably -<br/>&gt; probably by dozens of TU.</p><p>A common problem, due to the lid shading the pipe. Worse yet, in<br/>portatives, the pipes are packed so close to one another that they<br/>interact acoustically, so tuning one pipe can mess up the tuning of<br/>another already tuned, merely because the process changes the<br/>impedances of the ambient field.</p><p>&gt; So what use are TU there? Can one ever hear<br/>&gt; or control *one* TU?</p><p>How many angels can dance on a pinpoint?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cents have probably stayed in use partly because they do correspond<br/>&gt; quite closely to the minimum audible difference between intervals in<br/>&gt; some relevant situations - for example tuning fifths on a keyboard<br/>&gt; instrument.</p><p>Yeah, there is a pretty good theory/practice correlation with cents,<br/>though the main problem is that we hear beats and not interval size,<br/>and beats are linear while interval size is log. That&apos;s why we can<br/>tolerate a relatively large detuning (in cents). Often, when the<br/>tuning of an organ goes all wanky during a rehearsal and I&apos;ve only got<br/>45 minutes to clean it up AND retune the harpsi before the concert, I<br/>don&apos;t even touch the bass pipes. Nobody knows.</p><p>TU, like so much of what seems to go on here, is nothing more than<br/>having fun with numbers.

How you would best map this in your<br/>application sounds like a more complicated question, because you know<br/>the technical practicalities and I don&apos;t.</p><p>Why I don&apos;t a give quick summary of the categories of major and minor<br/>thirds? Certainly we can agree that the nearest range F-C# represents<br/>5-limit meantone, while the thirds C#/Db-F, Bb-C#/Db, and F-G#/Ab<br/>represent ratios of 2-3-7, the first 9:7 and the other two 7:6. It<br/>gets more complicated when we consider how a combination of small and<br/>large fifths in a chain can, in effect, disperse other kinds of<br/>commas.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;m doing you a favor here by mentioning yet more factors<br/>to consider diagramming. However, my purpose is only to explain how I tend<br/>to interpret the different third sizes, leaving to you the consideration<br/>what is possible, realistic, or elegant to include in a lattice diagram.</p><p>------------<br/>MAJOR THIRDS<br/>------------</p><p>Obviously the regular meantone thirds F-A, C-E, G-B, D-F#, and A-C# at<br/>383 cents, built exclusively from small fifths, represent 5:4.</p><p>The thirds Bb-D and E-G# at 396 cents, built from three small and one<br/>large fifths, may be considered rather compromised 5-limit thirds<br/>also. Indeed I often quote the usual &quot;meantone-like&quot; range as Bb-G#,<br/>which implies that these thirds are meant to be interchangeable with<br/>the near-pure ones.</p><p>The thirds Eb-G and B-D# at 408 cents, built from two small and two<br/>large fifths so that the two directions of temperament almost cancel<br/>out, are in effect representations of the Pythagorean 81:64, and<br/>generally are meant for a neomedieval rather than meantone style.<br/>Sonorities like Eb-G-C or C-Eb-G, however, do come up as touches of<br/>&quot;modal color&quot; in a meantone setting.</p><p>The thirds F#-A# and Ab-C at 421 cents, from three large and one small<br/>fifth, might be taken as not-so-accurate representations of 14:11,<br/>although 23:18 is also a possibility. These are very characteristically<br/>neomedieval, and not too far from 17-EDO -- but 14:11 or 23:18 seems<br/>to me the likely JI interpretation.</p><p>The third Db-F at 434 cents from four large fifths is a near-9:7, and<br/>here the lattice clearly enters septimal territory.</p><p>------------<br/>MINOR THIRDS<br/>------------</p><p>The thirds D-F, A-C, E-G, B-D, F#-A, and C#-E at 313 cents are again<br/>regular meantone intervals representing 6:5, from three small fifths<br/>(or large fourths).</p><p>The thirds G-Bb and G#-B at 300 cents built from two small and one<br/>large fifth have an ambiguous interpretation, with an inexact 6:5 in<br/>meantone or 32:27 in a neomedieval as likely historical associations.<br/>Sometimes 19:16 is also a possibility, as for example with G-Bb-D used<br/>in a style around 1500 as a closing sonority for G Dorian, say; this<br/>third might to some modern listeners, at least, actually be more<br/>conclusive than a near-just 6:5, although Bb-D is 8 cents narrow of<br/>the 24:19 in a just 16:19:24. Also, something like D-F-Ab/G#-B might<br/>be interpreted as 15:18:21:25, with G#-B at 300 cents as 25:21.</p><p>The thirds C-Eb and Eb-Gb at 287 cents, built from two large and one<br/>small fifth, closely represent 13:11, or also 33:28, and might also<br/>represent a variation on the traditional medieval 32:27.</p><p>The thirds F-Ab and Bb-Db at 275 cents, from three large fifths (or<br/>small fourths), represent 7:6, and are almost precisely at 75:64.<br/>Again, we are clearly in septimal territory, albeit not without some<br/>compromise.</p><p>To sum up, here are the ratios I might suggest are likeliest<br/>candidates, trying to focus on a few main themes:</p><p>MAJOR THIRDS            MINOR THIRDS</p><p> 383 cents               313 cents<br/>    5:4                     6:5</p><p> 396 cents               300 cents<br/>    5:4                  6:5, 32:27<br/>(more impure)</p><p>  408 cents              287 cents<br/>    81:64               13:11, 32:27</p><p>  421 cents              275 cents<br/> 14:11, 23:18               7:6</p><p>  434 cents<br/>     9:7</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>George D.

With non-<br/>proportional<br/>&gt; &gt; beating, the interactions between the differing beat rates sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; more disturbing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I have to admit that after a half hour of staring at my large<br/>&gt; monitor (19&quot; wide) and my big chart which graphically shows the beat<br/>&gt; rates of every major and minor triad over two octaves (thirds and<br/>&gt; fifths), I haven&apos;t got the foggiest notion what you are on about.<br/>When<br/>&gt; I switch back and forth between the regular-sized fifth version and<br/>&gt; your irregular sized fifth version, the movement of the traces is so<br/>&gt; small that it can hardly be seen (full scale is 25 b/s, so we&apos;re<br/>&gt; talking about 6mm or so for every 1 b/s - pretty darn easy to see<br/>&gt; changes that would be nigh to impossible to hear). If I set the<br/>trace<br/>&gt; value indicators to 2 decimal places, it also tells me that the<br/>change<br/>&gt; only affects a very few triads, and the largest change is in the<br/>area<br/>&gt; of  than 0,01 b/s. That means you are going to have to hold a triad<br/>&gt; for about 100 seconds while you do nothing else musically to<br/>distract<br/>&gt; the ear from the extremely subtle gradual drift of phase between<br/>third<br/>&gt; and fifth or third and third beat rates. Do you REALLY think this is<br/>&gt; an advantage?</p><p>If you&apos;re saying, for all practical purposes, there&apos;s no audible<br/>difference between slightly varying fifths with rational ratios and<br/>like fifths with irrational ratios, then yes, you&apos;re right.  OTOH, I<br/>could turn that around and say that there&apos;s no advantage of the like<br/>fifths with irrational ratios over slightly varying fifths with<br/>rational ratios.</p><p>Using rational fifths enables me *to define the tuning* in such a way<br/>that the proportions between the beat rates are *exact (usually<br/>simple) rational values* in both major and minor triads, so there is<br/>a *theoretical* advantage for doing this.

Applying this insight to my own modal style in its<br/>&quot;Manneristic&quot; aspects, I came upon a cadence that might be of<br/>interest.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest12-cadence001.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest12-cadence001.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest12-cadence001.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/zest12-cadence001.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>Tom&apos;s idea was a &quot;dominant&quot; sonority spelled in his message as<br/>C#-B-F-A, suggesting to me also the possibility of C#-F-G#-B in the<br/>rather different kind of musical syntax I often follow.</p><p>In Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone, and also in my encompassing spectrum<br/>tuning of 2003 (then called a &quot;temperament extraordinaire&quot;) based on<br/>this regular tuning, C#-F at about 433.52 cents is very close to<br/>9:7. Thus C#-F-G#-B gives a rather good approximation of 14:18:21:25,<br/>a sonority which George Secor called to my attention in October 2001<br/>as a pleasing use of 9:7. More specifically, he favored 14:18:21:25:28<br/>including the octave, with its many mixed isoharmonic differences of<br/>3, 4, and 7; but my progression in four voices uses the simpler<br/>14:18:21:25.[1]</p><p>Here is the progression, notated again in a usual meantone spelling,<br/>with C5 indicating middle C; as it happens, all notes and intervals<br/>used are identical to those of Zarlino&apos;s regular tuning. See also the<br/>link above to a PDF score:</p><p>  1    2   +  | 1   +     2  | 1     2  +   | 1    2    ||<br/>  B5   B5  B5   C6             C6       C6    C6<br/>  G#5  G#5 G#5  G5             A5       A5    A5<br/>  F5   F5  F5       E5 D5 E5   F5       F5    F5<br/>  C#5  C#5 C#5  C5             F4       F4    F4</p><p>A curious feature of this cadence is that the outer minor seventh of<br/>the opening sonority, which we might often expect to contract to a<br/>fifth by stepwise contrary motion, insteads expands in this fashion to<br/>an octave! Likewise the upper minor third, instead of contracting to a<br/>unison, expands to a fourth.</p><p>From this point of view, the seventh B5 might actually be viewed as a<br/>kind of surrogate for Bb5, which would yield a major sixth sonority at<br/>approximately 14:18:21:24. With this more conventional note, and the<br/>progression otherwise identical, we would have a major sixth C#5-Bb5<br/>expanding to an octave, and an upper major second G#5-Bb5 expanding to<br/>a fourth.</p><p>While the &quot;substitution&quot; of the minor seventh for the major sixth<br/>might be considered a kind of rhetorical figure -- see below -- in<br/>other ways this is typical &quot;Xeno-Mannerism.&quot; A sonority with a tritone<br/>or augmented fourth -- here F5-B5 -- characteristically serves as an<br/>antepenultimate leading up to a cadential 4-3 suspension. This might<br/>contrast with tonal harmony, where tritonic sonorities often play a<br/>penultimate or &quot;dominant&quot; role.</p><p>Also, the motion of the bass, descending first by a step and then by a<br/>fifth, is very characteristic both of historical Renaissance and<br/>Manneristic cadences, and of 21st-century offshoots such as this.<br/>Typically the stepwise descent is part of a resolution from major<br/>sixth to octave with an upper voice ascending by a whole tone, leading<br/>into a 4-3 suspension between the bass and another voice, which then<br/>ascends by a semitone while the bass descends a fifth.</p><p>This cadence varies only in that instead of an initial expansion from<br/>major sixth to octave, as already noted, we move from a minor seventh<br/>to an octave, which both outer voices moving by a semitone -- the<br/>minor semitone of 25:24 or about 71 cents in the bass, and the regular<br/>diatonic semitone of Zarlino&apos;s meantone at 121 cents in the soprano!</p><p>A fine point of contrapuntal style might involve the parallel fifths<br/>between bass and alto moving from the first to the second measure<br/>(C#-G# to C-G). Possibly one might argue that since the minor or<br/>chromatic semitone could be considered only a matter of &quot;coloring,&quot;<br/>this might be excused as analogous to repetition of a fifth without<br/>melodic motion! However, a better approach might be frankly to<br/>recognize that some of the normal liberties of historical medieval and<br/>neomedieval writing, where parallel fourths and fifths are freely<br/>used, are sometimes &quot;imported&quot; into Xeno-Manneristic idioms.<br/>Conventional meantone progressions would be more likely to observe<br/>16th-century proprieties.</p><p>Now for the concept of a rhetorical figure. In defending Monteverdi&apos;s<br/>bold uses of the minor seventh around 1600, treated rather more<br/>cautiously in a conventional 16th-century style (where it appears<br/>prominently mainly as a suspension), an academic writing under the<br/>name of &quot;l&apos;Ottuso&quot; argues as follows:</p><p>             &quot;[Y]ou allow an excellent poet the metaphor<br/>              purposely used; similarly the seventh is taken<br/>              in place of the octave.&quot;[2]</p><p>Here a minor seventh (C#-B) is taken in place of an expected<br/>near-septimal major sixth (C#-A#, or C#-Bb in a usual meantone<br/>spelling). Possibly this experiment in modern mannerism could serve as<br/>a tribute to the Monteverdi brothers (Claudio and his literary partner<br/>Giulio Cesare) for the 400th anniversary of their manifesto of 1607<br/>defending the modern practice of the previous six decades or so<br/>against those who could see Zarlino&apos;s classic rules of counterpoint as<br/>the only ones conceivable.</p><p>While the free uses of the seventh by Monteverdi and his contemporaries<br/>became one ingredient of major/minor tonality in the later part of the<br/>17th century, he and his brother in 1607 notably championed a style<br/>drawing on a variety of modes as might be required to express the<br/>ideas and emotions of a given text. It is interesting that precisely<br/>this concept had been championed in 1555 by Nicola Vicentino, who with<br/>his archicembalo and 31-note meantone cycle might be described as the<br/>greatest xenharmonicist of the 16th century.</p><p>It is thus as a meeting place of old and new that I share this<br/>cadence.</p><p>-----------<br/>   Notes<br/>-----------</p><p>1. Interestingly, George&apos;s colleague in so much of the development of<br/>   the Sagittal notation system, David Keenan, briefly mentions<br/>   14:18:21:25 as a possible tuning for the tonal dominant seventh in<br/>   a Tuning List post of 1999.</p><p>2.

To put it another way: we get five great neomedieval<br/>major thirds! That, however, evidently wasn&apos;t the goal of Couperin and<br/>his colleagues and successors in the art of the temperament ordinaire,<br/>although it might be fun to imagine them launching a revival of<br/>Machaut around 1700 and relishing the remote transpositions for this<br/>purpose!</p><p>Thus Zest may better fit something new, and keep alternative history a<br/>bit more distinct from actual history where confusion could indeed<br/>result.</p><p>&gt;  Have you tried a variant of this with 5th size ~695.63?

A possible just tuning has<br/>occurred to me which is not too far from the melodic steps you<br/>describe, and on which I would warmly invite your comments.</p><p>First, however, I would like to express my clear and strong opinion<br/>that some genres of Japanese music are indeed polyphonic. In gagaku,<br/>the classical court orchestral music, various kinds of complex<br/>sonorities with several voices sounding at once are a basic feature of<br/>the style. It is said that these sonorities are built from<br/>superimposed fifths or fourths, as also happens in some 20th-21st<br/>century European music, both classical and more popular.</p><p>This is also true for music played on the sheng or &quot;mouth organ,&quot; also<br/>common to the music of China, Laos (where it is known as the khene and<br/>is a treasured national instrument), and in certain Cambodian<br/>traditions.</p><p>Further, Japanese koto music often is polyphonic, in that it uses two<br/>or more notes sounding at the same time.

In gagaku,<br/>&gt; the classical court orchestral music, various kinds of complex<br/>&gt; sonorities with several voices sounding at once are a basic feature of<br/>&gt; the style. It is said that these sonorities are built from<br/>&gt; superimposed fifths or fourths, as also happens in some 20th-21st<br/>&gt; century European music, both classical and more popular.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is also true for music played on the sheng or &quot;mouth organ,&quot; also<br/>&gt; common to the music of China, Laos (where it is known as the khene and<br/>&gt; is a treasured national instrument), and in certain Cambodian<br/>&gt; traditions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Further, Japanese koto music often is polyphonic, in that it uses two<br/>&gt; or more notes sounding at the same time. A very beautiful sonority,<br/>&gt; for example, may involve the fifth at 3:2 or 702 cents in JI, and a<br/>&gt; major ninth at 9:4 or 1404 cents; interestingly, this happens both in<br/>&gt; medieval European music for voices and in modern Japanese koto music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here is the seven-note tuning which I mentioned above:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; !

For example,<br/>the 5:4 major third at 386 cents and 9:7 major third at 435 cents may<br/>have an intervening region of &quot;gravitational equipoise,&quot; or maximum<br/>complexity, at around 422 cents.</p><p>The paper explains David Keenan&apos;s ingenious process for estimating<br/>this NI value by using a Phi-weighted mediant of the two simpler<br/>ratios. Here, however, the purpose is not so much to analyze this<br/>process as to hear the audible results.</p><p>Zest-24 is called an &quot;Encompassing Spectrum Tuning&quot; because it surveys<br/>many different regions and subregions of interval space. In my notes<br/>for the mp3 examples which follow, I describe these regions in terms<br/>which hopefully will be reasonably self-explanatory, but are more<br/>fully developed in my newly completed paper exploring one possible<br/>approach to the interval spectrum.</p><p>    &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntervalSpectrumRegions.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>As mentioned at the beginning of this paper, I am much indebted to the<br/>very thoughtful and musically sensitive writings of David Keenan on<br/>interval names and regions and much else. Our counterpoint of ideas,<br/>like a musical counterpoint, seems to proceed now by similar and now<br/>by contrary motion.</p><p>    &lt;<a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/</a>&gt;</p><p>The Zest-24 system uses two 12-note circles of a modified meantone<br/>tuning based on Gioseffo Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma meantone. Each circle has<br/>eight regular meantone fifths (F-C#), with the other four equally<br/>wide; the two circles are at the distance of Zarlino&apos;s meantone<br/>diesis, 50.276 cents. A Scala file is included at the end of this<br/>article.</p><p>The name for each mp3 file starts with &quot;NIA&quot; for &quot;Noble Intonation<br/>Approximation,&quot; and includes the sizes in rounded cents for the<br/>relevant NI approximations used in a given example. Here I have<br/>specified the sizes which theoretically should occur in my specific<br/>synthesizer realization of Zest-24 in 1024-EDO, which may sometimes<br/>vary by something on the order of a cent from the values appearing in<br/>the Scala file below.</p><p>----------<br/>EXAMPLE 1.<br/>----------</p><p>      &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NIA001-422.926.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NIA001-422.926.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>This example includes two simple and very characteristic neomedieval<br/>cadences using a 422-cent major third and 926-cent major sixth, the<br/>first virtually coinciding with the estimated NI zone at 422 cents or<br/>so, and the second slightly wide of this zone at around 923 cents.<br/>The sonority Ab-C-F (or G#-C-F in a typical meantone spelling) found<br/>in either 12-note circle includes these intervals. The resolution has<br/>the major third expand to a fifth and the major sixth to an octave.</p><p>----------<br/>EXAMPLE 2.<br/>---------</p><p>      &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NIA002-337.829.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NIA002-337.829.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>This example features the small neutral third and sixth at 337 and 829<br/>cents, not too far from NI values of 339 and 833 cents -- these<br/>intervals, in either shading, may also be called supraminor thirds and<br/>sixths. Here the third expands to the fifth, and the sixth to the<br/>octave.

In this context, these intervals (C*-F-Bb) serve<br/>as an &quot;ultramajor&quot; third and sixth expanding to fifth and octave with<br/>the upper voices rising by 50-cent steps.</p><p>The 454-cent interval showcased in this example, by the way, is almost<br/>identical to Gene Ward Smith&apos;s &quot;ratwolf&quot; equal to precisely to 13:10,<br/>also his name for a regular meantone temperament differing minutely<br/>from 2/7-comma which produces a &quot;RAT(ional) WOLF&quot; at this just ratio<br/>from a chain of 11 fifths up. In Zest-24, the 2/7-comma &quot;near-ratwolf&quot;<br/>is tempered out or &quot;domesticated&quot; within each 12-note circle, but<br/>happily &quot;reintroduced into the wild&quot; by the 50-cent diesis between the<br/>two circles.</p><p>----------<br/>EXAMPLE 9.<br/>----------</p><p>       &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NIA009-926.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NIA009-926.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>This Manneristic cadence in a meantone style uses a 926-cent major<br/>sixth (or here diminished seventh) in the sonority C#-E-G-Bb at around<br/>0-313-626-926 cents, followed by a 4-3 suspension and resolution.</p><p>-----------<br/>EXAMPLE 10.<br/>-----------</p><p>       &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NIA010-422.2113.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NIA010-422.2113.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>An interesting feature of metastable or NI intervals underscored in a<br/>recent list contributed by David Keenan is that octave extensions can<br/>make a difference. Here the metastable or NI major third at 422 cents<br/>is coupled with a near-NI major 13th at 2113 cents, close to the<br/>estimated NI zone at around 2109 cents. These intervals (Gb3-Bb3-Eb5<br/>with C4 as middle C), available within either circle, resolve to fifth<br/>and 15th (or double octave) respectively.</p><p>-----------<br/>EXAMPLE 11.<br/>-----------</p><p>       &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NIA011-2055.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NIA011-2055.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>Another example of an NI interval larger than octave, this cadence has<br/>a 2055-cent neutral 13th, here used together with a 2752-cent neutral<br/>third plus two octaves or neutral 17th (Ab2-E*4-B*4). These intervals<br/>expand to the 15th or double octave and 19th or fifth plus double<br/>octave. This wide a spacing of voices is rather rare in a neomedieval<br/>style; but this example and the last show how certain NI intervals<br/>well beyond the octave may provide an incentive.</p><p>-----------<br/>EXAMPLE 12.<br/>-----------</p><p>       &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NIA012-422.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/NIA012-422.mp3</a>&gt;</p><p>This concluding example shows how the 422-cent NI major third may be<br/>used as an idiomatic meantone diminished fourth in a Manneristic<br/>style. Here we start at D-G-Bb-D, with the fourth and minor sixth<br/>above the bass suggesting a cadential approach.

The system Johnny already<br/>has in use feels very natural to a trained microtonal<br/>musician, because the quarter-tones are &quot;anchors&quot; at<br/>the 50-cent points, and so using +/-50 cents (without<br/>the quartertone accidentals) is an easy way for a performer<br/>to develop ear training to acheive the desired results.</p><p>&gt; For those don&apos;t want to cope with the many accidentals<br/>&gt; this requires, we offer lower-precision JI options:<br/>&gt; e.g., extreme-precision (olympian-level) JI corresponds<br/>&gt; to ~2460-EDO, whereas high-precision (herculean-level<br/>&gt; and promethean-level) JI is comparable to 612-EDO and<br/>&gt; 494-EDO (respectively), and medium-precision (athenian-<br/>&gt; level) JI to 224-EDO.

They allow the conservatory  trained music reader to<br/>follow a logic they come to expect as normal to  playing.  In addition,<br/>numbers 1-49 are clearly more likely to be numbers  less than 25.  50 breaks the<br/>bank.  Numbers larger than 50 are hard to  negotiate on the hoof.</p><p>I agree with George.</p><p>Joe:  Anyway, just some  ideas i had. The system Johnny already<br/>has in use feels very natural to a  trained microtonal<br/>musician, because the quarter-tones are &quot;anchors&quot;  at<br/>the 50-cent points,</p><p>Johnny:  I think they are much more visual anchors for  sight reading skill<br/>expectations more than they are soundposts for hearing an  interval.</p><p>Joe:  and so using +/-50 cents (without<br/>the  quartertone accidentals) is an easy way for a performer<br/>to develop ear  training to acheive the desired results.</p><p>Johnny:  Sorry to pick (or  poke), but where is the ear training from the<br/>following of visual  symbology?  They are apples and oranges here.  The hearing<br/>of, and the  initiating of, discrete microtonal intervals is independent of<br/>actually playing  it.  In fast movement the eye goes to a quartertone specific<br/>sector  (quadrant?) and the deviation of a norm is quickly calculated.  Even<br/>with  this, I use a notation shorthand for quick fingerings, but I still need the<br/> number of cents to set the intellect of my mind.  Both are necessary.</p><p>But there is also a difference between genuine sight reading,  and<br/>preparation preceding group reading.  At a certain point, a player  employs other<br/>symbology; I use a pair of glasses to make me alert at a certain  point in a piece<br/>of music.  I circle alternative fingerings to distinguish  them from the much<br/>more usual fingerings(generally yielding monophonic pivots,  if not simply<br/>alternative timbres).  There are some fingerings for ease of  motion, for<br/>trilling, for dynamic, for timbre, for pitch sensitivity (one with  open tone holes<br/>and one with the gradual depression of a key).  Of course,  I know you know much<br/>of this.</p><p>Joe:  Myself, i still like 72-edo HEWM. ;-P<br/>I&apos;m  still looking forward to having HEWM and Sagittal<br/>notations in Tonescape  someday, so i can compare the<br/>same piece notated both  ways.<br/>-monz</p><p>Johnny:  Great art is made out of the material found  about it.  There are<br/>many ways to segregate.  72 does not yield just  intervals that I miss.  But I<br/>still think it is the composer that  makes the difference, not the tuning.<br/>(But it does help some individuals  over the hump of being derivative, the method<br/>that is so abundant  taught in contemporary music education.)</p><p>************************************** See what&apos;s new at <a href="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</a></p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>11/13/2007 5:18:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo!</p><p>!!!</p><p>I am completely blown away by your post and your wonderful article<br/>surveying the interval spectrum.

Arigatogozaimas! Now I can read your chart without<br/>any problem</p><p>Also, please let me thank you very warmly for the _Haru-no-Kyoku_ mp3,<br/>which sounds to me very often polyphonic, and sometimes seems to use<br/>what is called in Europe &quot;imitation&quot; -- that is, having the same<br/>melodic theme or pattern sounded first in one voice, and then in<br/>another.</p><p>Your new listing of the four sets is very helpful in explaining a<br/>possible reason for the tuning I have proposed. However, please let me<br/>emphasize that _it is not necessarily better than your tuning above,<br/>or Herman&apos;s_. Either of those might be better, and also closer to the<br/>prevailing practice as you have described it!</p><p>Herman, please feel warmly welcome to step in at any point. I suspect<br/>that we are illustrating two approaches to tuning, and I hope that I<br/>am correctly interpretating your intentions. As I emphasize below,<br/>your tunings of minor thirds and sevenths are just as good as mine,<br/>and my idea is to experiment with the idea of a single chain of nine<br/>fifths to express the four transposition sets -- six pure fifths and<br/>three tempered by a tad less than five cents.</p><p>A possible advantage of my tuning is that it could be done on certain<br/>instruments with fewer than 13 notes available per octave, since it<br/>would allow us to use a single string, flute hole, or key on a<br/>keyboard to represent what have traditionally been two separate<br/>pitches. Thus we have in the usual style C# and C#-25, D# and D#-25,<br/>and F and F-25.</p><p>Here I would prefer to spell C# as Db, since C to Db-25 in the 4th set<br/>is a usual semitone, and Db-25 to Ab-25 is a regular fifth. However, I<br/>understand that Western note spellings may sometimes be confusing, and<br/>might actually myself be quite happy simply to use cents.</p><p>Why don&apos;t I first show my ten-note tuning in which we would need only<br/>one version rather than two for Db, F, and Ab; and then the four sets<br/>as they would be played in this tuning. Here I would add the Western<br/>note names at the end of each line, not being sure if they are<br/>helpful, and also column listing of where the note appears in each<br/>set, with an &quot;n&quot; meaning it is not used in a given set. For example,<br/>the notation &quot;D:154n&quot; tells us that D is the first step of the 1st<br/>set, the fifth step of the 2nd, the fourth step of the 3rd, and is not<br/>used in the 4th. I&apos;ve tried to get the four columns to line up.</p><p>  0:          1/1               0.000 unison, perfect prime    (D:;154n)<br/>  1:         22/21             80.537 undecimal minor semitone (Eb:26n3)<br/>  2:          9/8             203.910 major whole tone         (E:;nn5n)<br/>  3:         33/28            284.447 undecimal minor third    (F:;3764)<br/>  4:          4/3             498.045 perfect fourth           (G::4175)<br/>  5:         88/63            578.582                          (Ab:n2n6)<br/>  6:          3/2             701.955 perfect fifth            (A::5n1n)<br/>  7:         11/7             782.492 undecimal minor sixth    (Bb:6327)<br/>  8:         39/22            991.165 tridecimal minor seventh (C:;7431)<br/>  9:         13/7            1071.702 16/3-tone                (Db:nnn2)<br/> 10:          2/1            1200.000 octave                   (D:;154n)</p><p>We may need to discuss some concepts a bit, if you are curious,<br/>because I realize that the theory can get rather complicated.

Six<br/>of these fifths are pure, as in Herman&apos;s tuning also, where three of<br/>them are made wide by about five cents each.</p><p>Note that the tunings vary a little from set to set, but that they<br/>should all be reasonably tolerable, if my guess is correct -- this is<br/>for you to judge!</p><p>Indeed many of the intervals will be identical to those of Herman&apos;s<br/>fine tuning. Thus note that the 1st and 3rd sets have a pure fifth and<br/>a pure fourth above the first note (D or A), and that in the 3rd set,<br/>from A to G is a Pythagorean minor seventh at 16:9 or 996 cents.</p><p>At the same time, melodically, you will see that the semitone steps in<br/>each of these four sets, found between the first and second steps of a<br/>given set and also the fifth and sixth steps, are about 81 cents,<br/>somewhat wider than the preferred 75 cents, but yet smaller than the<br/>90 cents we would get tuning with all fifths and fourths pure.</p><p>This brings me to the idea of a &quot;chain of fifths,&quot; which you also<br/>mentioned in a message with questions for Herman. I will try and show<br/>the chain of fifths in this tuning, starting with Db and going to E.</p><p> Db--+4.9--Ab--0--Eb--0--Bb--0--F--+4.8--C--+4.9--G--0--D--0--A--0--E</p><p>Here a &quot;0&quot; between two numbers means a pure fifth, and &quot;+4.9&quot; or<br/>&quot;+4.8&quot; shows that a fifth is tempered wide by about 4.9 or 4.8 cents.</p><p>&gt;  Could you tell me why you prefer &quot;33/28 284.447 undecimal minor<br/>&gt;  third&quot; to Herman&apos;s suggestion &quot;32/27 294.135 Pythagorean minor<br/>&gt;  third&quot;?</p><p>Actually I think that these are both fine minor thirds, and very much<br/>like both flavors or shadings, as they might be called. The possible<br/>advantage of 33:28 is that, as one pleasing kind of minor third, it<br/>might be closer to a pure fourth in relation to your preferred size of<br/>minor sixth around 775 cents -- or, here, often 782 or 787 cents.<br/>Actually, 284 is closer to a pure fourth below 782 cents, while either<br/>284 or 294 cents (32:27) is comparably close to a pure fourth below<br/>787 cents.</p><p>&gt;  And &quot;39/22 991.165 tridecimal minor seventh&quot; to Herman&apos;s suggestion<br/>&gt;  &quot;16/9 996.090 Pythagorean minor seventh&quot;?</p><p>Either of these minor sevenths is fine! I&apos;d be happy to use either. In<br/>fact, if you are playing polyphony and play a note, its fourth, and<br/>minor seventh all together -- about 0-498-996 cents -- then you might<br/>prefer the pure 16:9 minor seventh of Herman&apos;s tuning, because both<br/>fourths will be pure. With my version, if you play D-G-C in the first<br/>set at the same time, D-G will be a pure fourth, but G-C will be<br/>almost five cents narrow.

The step<br/>of 131.55 cents should be especially welcome to Persian or Kurdish<br/>ears, for example, attuned to maqam or dastgah styles where a step on<br/>the order of 14:13 is very idiomatic. Here the mathematical noble<br/>mediant between 14:13 and 27:25 -- or also 1:1 and 13:12, as Dave has<br/>suggested -- happens to yield a fine melodic effect. I see no reason<br/>not to use this mathematical formula, or any mathematical formula,<br/>when it produces a result that fits the musical situation.</p><p>Dave, you are equally correct that the concept of Noble Intonation<br/>was, if I am correct, conceived as especially applying to<br/>_simultaneous_ intervals which represent regions of maximum complexity<br/>between two simpler ratios. A classic illustration, of course, is the<br/>pair of major thirds at a just 5:4 and 9:7, with the NI region located<br/>somewhere around 422 cents.</p><p>Thus I warmly agree that it would be a misunderstanding of the<br/>original NI concept to think that _any_ mathematical noble mediant<br/>between a pair of integer ratios will produce an audible &quot;NI&quot; effect.<br/>In fact, Oz&apos;s purpose seems to me quite different: to strike a kind of<br/>artful compromise between two sizes for _melodic_ steps, 14:13 and<br/>27:25. The mathematical noble mediant operation happens to produce a<br/>most agreeable result -- although that wasn&apos;t its original purpose.</p><p>Dave, I would say that one of the hallmarks of really great concepts<br/>and discoveries is that they may be used in various ways. Sometimes<br/>applications not anticipated by the discoverer may arise -- for better<br/>or worse -- and even be (mis)attributed to the discoverer.</p><p>Here I would say, &quot;Oz -- congratulations on a fine maqam tuning!&quot;; and<br/>to Dave, &quot;Indeed, while the formula was used here to pleasant effect,<br/>people should understand that the NI concept which gave rise to the<br/>formula is somewhat different.&quot;</p><p>With warmest wishes to you both, and all,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@calweb.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/22/2007 11:28:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Brad]</p><p>&gt; And to complete the picture of these several concerts, the rest of<br/>&gt; our first half (the 17th century half) was an Uccellini sonata in A<br/>&gt; minor, Venice 1649, which happened to have some B major triads in it<br/>&gt; (cadencing into E minor, repeatedly), and an F# major triad.  And<br/>&gt; the other accompanied piece was a Schmelzer sonata in G minor from<br/>&gt; 1664, which happens to need the note A-flat.  [And then he played<br/>&gt; the Biber unaccompanied Passacaglia, and then we went on to the<br/>&gt; Corelli as I mentioned above.]</p><p>Hi, Brad. Indeed this is a very interesting period, for me more or<br/>less _ultra_-modern, and in one style of periodization we would say<br/>that the 1640&apos;s might mark the end of the Manneristic era (1540-1640<br/>or so) and the beginning of the Early Baroque. In another traditional<br/>approach, the Baroque starts around 1600 with the rise of continuo<br/>notation, opera, and oratorio, so the whole 17th century would be<br/>included.</p><p>One small point, where I know that usages differ, although maybe not<br/>so relevantly for the intonational questions we&apos;re considering: While<br/>it&apos;s common to apply major/minor key labels to early 17th-century<br/>music, I might prefer to follow the composer&apos;s designation, whatever<br/>it is, for example a given tone or mode. Of course, if composers are<br/>already using major/minor terminology, then that would be both<br/>appropriate and very noteworthy -- for Uccellini, I&apos;m not sure.</p><p>&gt; Again: what would you have us do?  1/4 comma meantone doesn&apos;t really<br/>&gt; work for *any* of these pieces, unless we&apos;re supposed to put up with<br/>&gt; ridiculous-sounding B major and F# major in normal cadencing<br/>&gt; situations.</p><p>Actually my guess is that 1/4-comma meantone should be just fine, if<br/>you use a tuning set which has accidentals with proper spellings for<br/>sonorities like B-D#-F# and F#-A#-C#. This would often involve the<br/>very authentic period choice of an instrument with more than 12 notes<br/>per octave.</p><p>While an instrument with only a couple of split keys (G#/Ab, Eb/D#)<br/>would address a lot of common situations, here we also need A#, which<br/>might suggest an instrument with at least 17 notes per octave. A usual<br/>_cembalo cromatico_ of the kind popular around Naples in the epoch of<br/>Gesualdo, with 19 notes per octave likely tuned in 1/4-comma, would<br/>neatly address the situation.</p><p>This is the kind of 19-note keyboard recommended by Praetorius, and<br/>also taken by Fabio Colonna (1618) as the basis for tuning the first<br/>19 notes of his 31 note _Sambuca Lincea_ evidently based on a cycle of<br/>1/4-comma meantone closely approximating 31-EDO. Of course, Colonna is<br/>championing a 31-note meantone cycle which goes back to Nicola<br/>Vicentino (1555, 1561).</p><p>In 1666, Lemme Rossi discusses both extended 1/4-comma meantone and a<br/>precise 31-EDO, with Christiaan Huygens in 1691 advocating &quot;The New<br/>Harmonic Cycle&quot; based on 31-EDO, which he also shows differs only<br/>minutely from the familiar 1/4-comma.</p><p>Of course, one could construct examples where extended 1/4-comma (or<br/>31-EDO) would run into problems: specifically, if a composer relies on<br/>enharmonic equivalence, as Vincenzo Galilei does in the late 16th<br/>century specifically to show the &quot;perfection&quot; of 12-EDO and the lute<br/>as an instrument customarily using it.</p><p>However, unless this kind of equivalence is demanded, my guess is that<br/>the problem you are describing is not inherent to 1/4-comma, but<br/>rather to instruments which don&apos;t cover a large enough range of it to<br/>have available the needed accidentals for a given piece.</p><p>I realize, of course, that this is a rather obvious point; but since<br/>period practices are such an important consideration in this thread,<br/>maybe mentioning split-key accidentals isn&apos;t out of place.</p><p>This leaves the question, &quot;What should we do if only a 12-note<br/>keyboard is available?&quot; That&apos;s an intriguing question. Of course, one<br/>period solution (however controversial) is a regular tuning at or not<br/>too far from 12-EDO, which Mersenne discusses in the 1630&apos;s, and Denis<br/>heartily disapproves in his treatise on keyboard tuning and music<br/>(1643, 1650). Doni tells the story that Frescobaldi recommended 12-EDO<br/>for a new church organ which Doni persuaded those responsible to tune<br/>in the usual meantone -- however accurate or otherwise this tale.</p><p>Another is some kind of temperament ordinaire based on something<br/>around 1/4-comma. An interesting question is what context F#-A#-C#<br/>appears in. If it&apos;s used as a cadential sonority leading to B, then a<br/>bit of ornamentation might help (a la Schlick 1511). Mark Lindley<br/>suggests that even an unaltered 1/4-comma diminished fourth at 32:25<br/>(427 cents) might be used in ornamented contexts, although an<br/>irregular scheme that ameliorates F#-A# to about Pythagorean could<br/>further ease this dilemma.</p><p>Again, 1650 is really late for me, so I&apos;d welcome comments from Tom or<br/>others more conversant with this epoch.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/22/2007 1:30:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Another is some kind of temperament ordinaire based on something<br/>&gt; around 1/4-comma.

Some sections<br/>modulated into G# minor, as well.  And, in that sonata, the<br/>harpsichord or organ had to play those harmonies for a whole bar (with<br/>a somewhat moving bass line, too), in long sequences, while the violin<br/>did bariolage figurations in continuous motion: four-note chords of<br/>his own, broken up.  Again, not a great place to try to make up<br/>right-hand dodgy continuo stuff just because an F would be way too<br/>high to serve as E#, or a Bb way too high to be A#.</p><p>The far more elegant solution is to scrap the unworkable notion of 1/4<br/>comma around the naturals, open the thing up, and have some room to<br/>breathe!</p><p>I don&apos;t see any compelling reason to borrow advice from Schlick 1511<br/>to play music from more than 130 years later (the Uccellini and<br/>Schmelzer), or 189 years (the Corelli)!  :)</p><p>=====</p><p>To try out the new Yale University organ a few months ago (while it<br/>was still inside the factory in Virginia), I brought along a book of<br/>Froberger.  The instrument has regular 1/4 comma everywhere, and<br/>several split keys for the subsemitones (two or three splits in each<br/>octave, except for the bass).  Well...it still didn&apos;t work.  I tried<br/>out several pieces that were harmonically adventurous, from the<br/>1640s-60s.  And they just sounded stupid whenever notes such as E# and<br/>B# turned up, having no split key available.  No amount of<br/>ornamentation salvaged such spots, especially in a piece by Froberger<br/>that *ends* each of its sections on a C# major triad!</p><p>Nor do I buy the fantasy argument that organists simply transposed the<br/>whole piece (if indeed they played composed pieces in public at<br/>all...); one of the Froberger toccatas I played needed not only<br/>E#/A#/D#/G#/C#/F#, but also Db/Ab/Eb/Bb and F and C.  And it&apos;s<br/>definitely an organ piece: by its title, it&apos;s for use during the<br/>elevation of the host during a liturgy.  There&apos;s no wholesale<br/>transposition of the composition available that would get it to work<br/>on extended regular 1/4 comma, even if all five raised keys got<br/>split...because it would also have to have one or more split *naturals*.</p><p>The failure here is not the physical keyboard with its limitations,<br/>but rather the premise of 1/4 comma for such repertoire.  I find it<br/>sad to see a brand-new, deluxe, expensive organ go into service, with<br/>a temperament scheme unable to play early-to-mid-17th-century core<br/>repertoire.  (Some Frescobaldi would have problems, too.)  But, they<br/>built it the way the customer wanted and ordered it....</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@calweb.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2007 11:34:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  In the Uccellini piece we played, it had me sitting on B major for a<br/>&gt;  whole bar at a time while the violin played melodic/ornamental stuff,<br/>&gt;  and then E minor for the whole next bar.

I&apos;d say that your<br/>interpretation of the 1722 diagram is one very interesting contender,<br/>with some Neidhardt temperaments also very plausible. However, I<br/>should caution that I feel on much more confident ground when<br/>discussing modal rather than tonal styles.</p><p>&gt;  Similarly, as I mentioned, the Corelli D major sonata we played<br/>&gt;  (from 1700) had a bunch of F# major and C# major in it.

The far more elegant solution is to scrap the unworkable<br/>&gt;  notion of 1/4 comma around the naturals, open the thing up, and<br/>&gt;  have some room to breathe!</p><p>Since Corelli&apos;s style is often regarded as the clear advent of<br/>major/minor tonality, I&apos;d say that there could be arguments for a<br/>temperament less heavy that 1/4-comma on melodic grounds; we might<br/>want a narrower diatonic semitone narrower than 117 cents, for example.<br/>Around 1700, there&apos;s evidence that people often preferred something<br/>around 1/5-1/6 comma, not to speak of various irregular schemes.</p><p>However, a strictly technical answer to your remarks is that a 19-note<br/>tuning of 1/4-comma (Gb-B#), the kind of thing that had been known for<br/>at least about 150 years by 1700, would provide both A# and E#, as<br/>well as B# if that should come up. Again, I&apos;m not saying that it&apos;s the<br/>best temperament for repertory around 1700, only that from a view of<br/>having the right accidentals, it allows considerable &quot;room to breathe.&quot;</p><p>&gt;  I don&apos;t see any compelling reason to borrow advice from Schlick<br/>&gt;  1511 to play music from more than 130 years later (the Uccellini<br/>&gt;  and Schmelzer), or 189 years (the Corelli)! :)</p><p>While it was my purpose to honor Schlick for his description of what<br/>might be called the first known modified meantone tuning, I should<br/>emphasize that for music around 1650, there are some later clues and<br/>theorists that suggest similar conclusions. Thus Praetorius in 1618 or<br/>so reports that some people tune 1/4-comma so as to compromise notes<br/>such as G#/Ab -- much, I would add, as Schlick describes in 1511.</p><p>Also, Werckmeister in his _Orgel Probe_ of 1698 urges people who want<br/>to stick with the &quot;Praetorian temperament&quot; (i.e. 1/4-comma) to<br/>consider at least doing precisely this kind of thing with Eb/D#, for<br/>example. I&apos;m not recommending it as an ideal solution, but mentioning<br/>it as an idea that comes up in 1618 and 1698 as well as in 1511.</p><p>As to the use of a major third around Pythagorean -- or possibly even<br/>a full meantone diminished fourth -- in an ornamented cadence, Mark<br/>Lindley suggests indications in some keyboard music around 1600 where<br/>D# is consistently treated in this way as evidence for a regular<br/>meantone in 12 notes (e.g. Eb-G#) with this liberty allowed. Again,<br/>this is very much like Schlick&apos;s treatment of G# in his organ<br/>compositions. This isn&apos;t to say it is an ideal, or even credible,<br/>solution for every mid-17th century piece as played on a 12-note<br/>instrument in a more or less regular meantone around 1/4-comma, only<br/>that I&apos;m not relying on Schlick in isolation to raise certain<br/>possibilities that _might_ be tried for some pieces.</p><p>Also, I&apos;d emphasize that some 16th-century as well as 17th-century<br/>pieces clearly call for a proper D#; Vicentino uses it, as does Andrea<br/>Gabrieli in a musical setting of the Oedipus drama where trying to<br/>ornament every time it comes up would be quite untenable. Of course,<br/>if the range happens to stay within Bb-D#, then on harpsichord one<br/>could retune Eb to D#, and then retune it for pieces preferring the<br/>more usual Eb. The Yale University organ, of course, would make such<br/>retuning unnecessary, since it has both Eb and D#.</p><p>&gt;  To try out the new Yale University organ a few months ago (while it<br/>&gt;  was still inside the factory in Virginia), I brought along a book<br/>&gt;  of Froberger. The instrument has regular 1/4 comma everywhere, and<br/>&gt;  several split keys for the subsemitones (two or three splits in<br/>&gt;  each octave, except for the bass).</p><p>I&apos;d be curious as to the precise accidentals. From your description, I<br/>might guess something like Gb-A#, with 17 notes per octave.</p><p>&gt;  Well...it still didn&apos;t work. I tried out several pieces that were<br/>&gt;  harmonically adventurous, from the 1640s-60s. And they just sounded<br/>&gt;  stupid whenever notes such as E# and B# turned up, having no split<br/>&gt;  key available. No amount of ornamentation salvaged such spots,<br/>&gt;  especially in a piece by Froberger that *ends* each of its sections<br/>&gt;  on a C# major triad!</p><p>My first reaction is that I would have advised them, if they&apos;re going<br/>this far, to go just a bit further and have a standard 19-note tuning<br/>of Gb-B#, which, for example, very nicely supports C#-E#-G#.</p><p>The main reason wouldn&apos;t necessarily be to play Froberger, whose music<br/>Mark Lindley suggests is really best in 12-EDO, but to fit the style<br/>of composers like Gesualdo and Trabaci who may use a range of Gb-B#,<br/>and make a distinction, for example, between B# and C at a diesis<br/>apart (I know specifically that Gesualdo does this).</p><p>This would be like the lower manual of Nicola Vicentino&apos;s arcicembalo<br/>or (presumably) arciorgano, with 19 notes (also Gb-B#). There is a<br/>theoretical consideration supporting this tuning size, standard on the<br/>_cembalo cromatico_ around 1600 and also on some French instruments<br/>like that of Costeley (which he started using in 1558, as I recall,<br/>and described in 1570) at 1/3-comma or 19-EDO. We have what Erv Wilson<br/>calls in modern terms a &quot;Moment of Symmetry&quot; (MOS) where there are<br/>only two sizes of adjacent steps, here the meantone chromatic or minor<br/>semitone at about 76 cents in 1/4-comma, and the enharmonic diesis at<br/>128:125 or about 41 cents.</p><p>Here&apos;s a Scala file:</p><p>! meanquar_19.scl<br/>!<br/>19 of 1/4-comma meantone scale<br/> 19<br/>!<br/> 76.04900<br/> 117.10786<br/> 193.15686<br/> 269.20586<br/> 310.26471<br/> 5/4<br/> 462.36271<br/> 503.42157<br/> 579.47057<br/> 620.52943<br/> 696.57843<br/> 25/16<br/> 8/5<br/> 889.73529<br/> 965.78428<br/> 1006.84314<br/> 1082.89214<br/> 125/64<br/> 2/1</p><p>However, I certainly wouldn&apos;t be disappointed with that 17-note Gb-A#<br/>instrument (which would be an MOS in a Pythagorean tuning, or some<br/>modern regular temperament with fifths a bit larger than pure,<br/>obviously both relevant to other styles than those we&apos;re discussing!).</p><p>There&apos;s a wealth of conventional and more adventurous 16th-century and<br/>early 17th-century music that will fit beautifully on that new organ,<br/>including, of course, pieces with both Eb and D#, or indeed chromatic<br/>settings by Lasso that go up to A#.</p><p>While there might be a few pieces by Frescobaldi that might not fit,<br/>there are lots and lots that will.</p><p>Also, where diminished fourths or augmented fifths are intended as<br/>&quot;special effects&quot; intervals in meantone, they&apos;ll have their<br/>characteristic proportions.</p><p>Having stated some advantages of 19 tones above, I should emphasize<br/>that split-key instruments varied considerably in the number of notes<br/>per octave, with 17 as one quite tenable compromise. The repertory is<br/>large enough that the new Yale instrument should make lots of<br/>beautiful music.</p><p>&gt;  Nor do I buy the fantasy argument that organists simply transposed<br/>&gt;  the whole piece (if indeed they played composed pieces in public at<br/>&gt;  all...); one of the Froberger toccatas I played needed not only<br/>&gt;  E#/A#/D#/G#/C#/F#, but also Db/Ab/Eb/Bb and F and C. And it&apos;s<br/>&gt;  definitely an organ piece: by its title, it&apos;s for use during the<br/>&gt;  elevation of the host during a liturgy. There&apos;s no wholesale<br/>&gt;  transposition of the composition available that would get it to<br/>&gt;  work on extended regular 1/4 comma, even if all five raised keys<br/>&gt;  got split...because it would also have to have one or more split<br/>&gt;  *naturals*.</p><p>First of all, Lindley&apos;s suggestion of 12-EDO as Froberger&apos;s preferred<br/>tuning would cover this kind of situation; it&apos;s an interesting<br/>question whether, if Lindley&apos;s conclusion is correct, this might be<br/>indirect evidence that Froberger was influenced in this taste by his<br/>teacher Frescobaldi, maybe making Doni&apos;s story about the latter&apos;s<br/>penchant for 12-EDO more credible. Then, again, the example of Zarlino<br/>and his student Vincenzo Galilei cautions us that a teacher is not<br/>necessarily responsible for all the views of her/his pupil -- although<br/>Galilei, as it happens, expresses a liking for Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma as<br/>the most pleasing keyboard temperament.</p><p>As I explained above, the &quot;split naturals&quot; as you call them of E#/F<br/>and B#/C are standard in a 19-note meantone tuning of Gb-B#, which is<br/>what was tuned in parts of France and Italy around 1600, and also<br/>specifically commended by Praetorius in 1618 as solving lots of<br/>accidental problems. With &quot;an extended regular 1/4-comma&quot; in this<br/>size, no transposition would be needed, because all of your<br/>accidentals specified above would be available in their usual places.</p><p>Just for fun, I would add that if your listing of accidentals for the<br/>Froberger toccata is complete (Db-E#), one _could_ play this on a<br/>17-note Gb-A# instrument by transposing down a fifth or up a fourth.<br/>Then we would have Gb-A#, which just fits the range of the instrument.</p><p>This isn&apos;t to say that this fantasy scenario, as you term it, is an<br/>ideal solution: if Froberger intended 12-EDO, I&apos;d say that that is<br/>what we should use, a fascinating early instance of its choice for an<br/>organ piece.</p><p>However, if the folks at Yale want to try a transposition as an<br/>interesting kind of variant reading, I&apos;d say, &quot;Go ahead, and let&apos;s<br/>hear how it sounds.&quot; This is the same kind of thing that applies to<br/>Aaron Johnson&apos;s meantone realizations of Elizabethan and Jacobean<br/>keyboard music, where 1/3-comma or 19-EDO might be a bit heavier<br/>temperament than Bull might have used, but is quite pleasing and<br/>striking.</p><p>&gt;  The failure here is not the physical keyboard with its limitations,<br/>&gt;  but rather the premise of 1/4 comma for such repertoire. I find it<br/>&gt;  sad to see a brand-new, deluxe, expensive organ go into service,<br/>&gt;  with a temperament scheme unable to play early-to-mid-17th-century<br/>&gt;  core repertoire. (Some Frescobaldi would have problems, too.) But,<br/>&gt;  they built it the way the customer wanted and ordered it....</p><p>Personally, I find it delightful to see a brand new organ go into<br/>service with a temperament scheme ideally fitting a vast repertory of<br/>16th-century and early 17th-century music -- much of it within a<br/>conventional Eb-G# range, and some of it calling for 13-17 notes per<br/>octave. Here I&apos;m talking about the Renaissance and Manneristic eras,<br/>say 1450-1650 or so. The fact that a few pieces might not fit, or<br/>technically might be playable but really better adapted to other<br/>tuning schemes, should hardly be cause for sadness, only an indication<br/>that no one tuning scheme can cover everything.</p><p>Yes, 19 notes would have been yet more versatile than 17, and 31 notes<br/>more versatile yet (a complete 1/4-comma circle) -- but the perfect<br/>need not preclude the very good.</p><p>Also, I&apos;m not offering 1/4-comma as a universal temperament solution.<br/>The people at Yale might also want a Pythagorean organ for medieval<br/>repertory (17 notes, Gb-A#, as described in the early 15th century,<br/>would be ideal), and something in a irregular 12-note temperament of<br/>some kind if they&apos;re going to play music after around 1650, or also a<br/>few earlier pieces you&apos;ve mentioned that might fit this kind of scheme.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2007 1:46:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt;  To try out the new Yale University organ a few months ago (while<br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt;  was still inside the factory in Virginia), I brought along a book<br/>&gt; &gt;  of Froberger.

I&apos;d like to express my regrets for any needless controversy or<br/>excitement in my remarks, especially when I have a responsibility to<br/>set a different kind of example on this list, as some of your writings<br/>very wisely remind me.</p><p>First, while trying to follow the information offered by the builder<br/>of the Yale University organ still left me uncertain to exactly how<br/>many subsemitones or split-key accidentals there are in an octave,<br/>your estimate of 14 or 15 sounds very reasonable -- maybe G#/Ab,<br/>Eb/D#, plus one other pair (C#/Db?).</p><p>If I now understand correctly, then obviously we&apos;re agreed that lots<br/>of music likely intended for other kinds of tuning systems will be out<br/>of its reach, as well as some 19-tone meantone repertory like the<br/>_cembalo cromatico_ music around 1600 or some Gesualdo pieces.</p><p>However, this is hardly in my view a major fault of the Yale organ,<br/>because I&apos;d regard even a usual 12-note keyboard in 1/4-comma meantone<br/>as incredibly versatile. In fact, I&apos;d say that Eb/D# and G#/Ab should<br/>handle a lot of commonly occurring situations around 1600.</p><p>If I were advising them, I would say that considering 19 notes per<br/>octave would be good (Gb-A#). What I&apos;d _really_ like to see is a<br/>31-note instrument, which shows the full potential of 1/4-comma<br/>and supports enharmonic or fifthtone pieces (e.g. Vicentino and<br/>Colonna). Especially in a group which often celebrates explicitly<br/>microtonal music, I consider this well worth mentioning.</p><p>Having said this, I&apos;d like to focus on a few important points which<br/>could be more important than technical niceties of transposition and the<br/>like.</p><p>First, I&apos;m really not in a good position to give opinions on what is<br/>best for Froberger, Corelli, or Bach. This music is outside the<br/>scope of what I&apos;m familiar with and take as the main basis for my own<br/>compositions and improvisations.</p><p>Having seen what happens when people discuss medieval and Renaissance<br/>music, often in widely disseminated articles or textbooks, with what<br/>seems to me less than comfortable familiarity with these styles, I<br/>have no reason to suppose that I would do better with periods likewise<br/>not so familiar to me. Further, I don&apos;t have the justification many of<br/>these authors do that &quot;the curriculum requires it.&quot;</p><p>Thus I should enact a self-denying ordinance excluding myself from the<br/>&quot;Bach&apos;s tuning&quot; debate; people who are well-informed can get<br/>themselves into enough dilemmas without my &quot;help&quot;!</p><p>Further, I would emphasize that a temperament like Zest-12 or Zest-24<br/>is _not_ proposed as an &quot;historical tuning&quot; of any kind, but rather a<br/>21st-century tuning that happens to fit certain stylistic directions.</p><p>Specifically, having mentioned some possible &quot;compromises&quot; in our<br/>discussion, I would emphasize that I _don&apos;t_ consider ornamented<br/>versions of standard 16th-17th century cadences as the best use for a<br/>major third of 408 cents or 422 cents, say.</p><p>A far nobler use is to use such a third so that it will really be in<br/>tune, whether as a meantone diminished fourth, or as a usual<br/>neomedieval major third. Thus in Zest-12 or Zest-24, B-D# is much<br/>nicer in some kind of neo-Gothic context (e.g. B-D#-G# before A#-E#-A#<br/>or A-E-A) than in B-D#-F# before E-G#-B. Likewise, F#-A#-C# is<br/>beautiful in a 13th-century style of cadence to G#-D#.</p><p>The sad thing about meantones, and especially some modified ones,<br/>from a certain 21st-century perspective, is that you have all of these<br/>wonderful wide major and small minor thirds that didn&apos;t really get<br/>fully used in 16th-17th century period styles, because people weren&apos;t<br/>aware of how nicely these intervals might fit more of a 13th-14th<br/>century style.</p><p>Anyway, without taking any position on the Bach tuning question, I<br/>must admire and commend your thoroughness in testing out different<br/>pieces and seeking a solution &quot;to taste&quot; that can also fit the<br/>historical evidence. That is a great contribution.</p><p>With many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>11/23/2007 4:12:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; First, while trying to follow the information offered by the builder<br/>&gt; of the Yale University organ still left me uncertain to exactly how<br/>&gt; many subsemitones or split-key accidentals there are in an octave,<br/>&gt; your estimate of 14 or 15 sounds very reasonable -- maybe G#/Ab,<br/>&gt; Eb/D#, plus one other pair (C#/Db?).</p><p>Take another look at the photo links I sent, especially this one:<br/><a href="http://www.taylorandboody.com/opuses/opus_55_pages/10_19_06/55keys.htm">http://www.taylorandboody.com/opuses/opus_55_pages/10_19_06/55keys.htm</a></p><p>1.

No Db, Gb, Cb, B#, or E# anywhere on the instrument.</p><p>If I remember correctly, from only about 20 minutes of playing it<br/>some months ago, the Eb/D# and the G#/Ab play differently from each<br/>other: the front half of the key plays the Eb or G# (i.e. the more<br/>frequently-needed note), and the back half plays the D# or Ab.  It<br/>would have made more sense to me as a player to have the back half<br/>always be the flat and the front half always be the sharp, or vice<br/>versa, consistently across the whole keyboard....  The actual layout<br/>makes it quite tricky to play things such as A-flat major triads,<br/>using the front half of one split key with the back half of the other<br/>one.</p><p>2. Now to the bass octave, everything below tenor c:</p><p>No subsemitones anywhere (not even for the G#/Ab); rather, all the<br/>split keys there (but only available on one of the three manuals) are<br/>to handle the short-octave layout.</p><p>That lowest octave is short, whether the keys are split or not: the<br/>lever looking like &quot;E&quot; plays C, the F plays F, the &quot;F#&quot; plays D, the<br/>G plays G, the &quot;G#&quot; plays E, the A plays A, and then the Bb and B do<br/>what they look like.</p><p>The low F# and G# are available only on the lowest manual, the<br/>Ruckpositif, by playing the back half of the split.  On the other two<br/>manuals those notes aren&apos;t available.</p><p>Lowest C# or Eb aren&apos;t available on any of the manuals.  Compositions<br/>requiring them *won&apos;t* be played.</p><p>3. And in the pedal it&apos;s fully chromatic, except that there&apos;s no<br/>lowest C# or Db.  Or any subsemitones (unless I&apos;m mis-remembering the<br/>pedalboard).</p><p>It seems to me, if Yale&apos;s folks wanted their organ students to learn<br/>short-octave layouts and 1/4 comma meantone hands-on and intimately,<br/>another good way to do so would be to have all their organ students<br/>take at least a required year of harpsichord lessons, and give them<br/>harpsichord tuning duties, on some suitable early-Italian or early-<br/>German harpsichords.  :)</p><p>Short-octave stuff is daily bread, with a couple of different<br/>schemes, for some of the harpsichord repertoire by 17th century<br/>Germans (and Froberger)...and especially so, going back into the 16th<br/>in other countries as well.</p><p>I must also say, not in conjunction with Yale or anything else<br/>specifically, but just to say it: the presence of split keys and/or<br/>short octave on any keyboard instrument still doesn&apos;t constrain<br/>anybody to use regular 1/4 on it, to the exclusion of other systems.<br/>What&apos;s to stop anyone from tuning a subsemitones keyboard to regular<br/>1/6 or anything else of one&apos;s fancy?  (And the front half and the<br/>back half would then be one Pyth comma apart....)  The split keys<br/>only provide an option to do some *different* note, and to have<br/>either half be the higher-pitched half, to one&apos;s choosing.  On an<br/>organ, though, such things can&apos;t be changed day to day.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2007 5:00:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Margo,</p><p>My apologies for the late reply.

Here the mathematical noble<br/>&gt; mediant between 14:13 and 27:25 -- or also 1:1 and 13:12, as Dave has<br/>&gt; suggested -- happens to yield a fine melodic effect. I see no reason<br/>&gt; not to use this mathematical formula, or any mathematical formula,<br/>&gt; when it produces a result that fits the musical situation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dave, you are equally correct that the concept of Noble Intonation<br/>&gt; was, if I am correct, conceived as especially applying to<br/>&gt; _simultaneous_ intervals which represent regions of maximum complexity<br/>&gt; between two simpler ratios. A classic illustration, of course, is the<br/>&gt; pair of major thirds at a just 5:4 and 9:7, with the NI region located<br/>&gt; somewhere around 422 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus I warmly agree that it would be a misunderstanding of the<br/>&gt; original NI concept to think that _any_ mathematical noble mediant<br/>&gt; between a pair of integer ratios will produce an audible &quot;NI&quot; effect.<br/>&gt; In fact, Oz&apos;s purpose seems to me quite different: to strike a kind of<br/>&gt; artful compromise between two sizes for _melodic_ steps, 14:13 and<br/>&gt; 27:25. The mathematical noble mediant operation happens to produce a<br/>&gt; most agreeable result -- although that wasn&apos;t its original purpose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dave, I would say that one of the hallmarks of really great concepts<br/>&gt; and discoveries is that they may be used in various ways. Sometimes<br/>&gt; applications not anticipated by the discoverer may arise -- for better<br/>&gt; or worse -- and even be (mis)attributed to the discoverer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I would say, &quot;Oz -- congratulations on a fine maqam tuning!&quot;; and<br/>&gt; to Dave, &quot;Indeed, while the formula was used here to pleasant effect,<br/>&gt; people should understand that the NI concept which gave rise to the<br/>&gt; formula is somewhat different.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With warmest wishes to you both, and all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@calweb.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2007 9:39:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;  Take another look at the photo links I sent, especially this one:<br/>&gt;  &lt;<a href="http://www.taylorandboody.com/opuses/opus_55_pages/10_19_06/55keys.htm">http://www.taylorandboody.com/opuses/opus_55_pages/10_19_06/55keys.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>Thank you for this specific link. One lesson I&apos;ve learned from this is<br/>that especially with a site where there isn&apos;t such easy navigation<br/>with a text-based browser, I would do better to download and save your<br/>post in HTML format and then follow the URL&apos;s with links rather than<br/>lynx (the latter of which is more compatible with Yahoo).</p><p>&gt;  If I remember correctly, from only about 20 minutes of playing it<br/>&gt;  some months ago, the Eb/D# and the G#/Ab play differently from each<br/>&gt;  other: the front half of the key plays the Eb or G# (i.e. the more<br/>&gt;  frequently-needed note), and the back half plays the D# or Ab. It<br/>&gt;  would have made more sense to me as a player to have the back half<br/>&gt;  always be the flat and the front half always be the sharp, or vice<br/>&gt;  versa, consistently across the whole keyboard.... The actual layout<br/>&gt;  makes it quite tricky to play things such as A-flat major triads,<br/>&gt;  using the front half of one split key with the back half of the<br/>&gt;  other one.</p><p>What I suspect, Brad, is that this question of preference might be one<br/>indication of what repertories a given player is most familiar with or<br/>gives highest priority. You are, of course, correct that Ab-C-Eb or<br/>the like would be easier if flats were aligned with flats, and sharps<br/>with sharps, consistently.</p><p>My own preference would be for the rather standard 16th-century<br/>approach they&apos;ve evidently taken, which is also Vicentino&apos;s, for<br/>example. I would regard Eb and G# as &quot;usual,&quot; and D# or Ab as more<br/>&quot;unusual.&quot;</p><p>While I haven&apos;t experienced this issue directly with split keys<br/>proper, I have dealt with the analogous situation of mapping a 17-note<br/>circulating system to a potentially 24-note keyboard with two standard<br/>12-note manuals. Do I put all the flats on one keyboard and the sharps<br/>on another, or do Eb-G# on the lower keyboard and the more &quot;unusual&quot;<br/>accidentals on the other?</p><p>I&apos;ve tried both, and preferred the Eb-G# arrangement as more familiar,<br/>although it is much _less_ convenient for Ab-Eb, especially if this<br/>occurs with an octave, Ab-Eb-Ab -- and likewise with G#-D#. Well, with<br/>a 17-note circle, at least there&apos;s the compensation of having the<br/>fifth A#-Gb (or A#-E# for an equivalent spelling) with both notes on<br/>the same keyboard.</p><p>Actually, with two 12-note manuals, I find that I tend to go for<br/>24-note tunings where the two manuals have identical steps and<br/>intervals at some fixed distance apart (e.g. 1/4-comma or 2/7-comma<br/>meantone at the enharmonic diesis, or Zest-24, a kind of modified<br/>variation on the latter, with 18 or the 24 notes identical to a<br/>regular 24-note tuning).</p><p>&gt;  I must also say, not in conjunction with Yale or anything else<br/>&gt;  specifically, but just to say it: the presence of split keys and/or<br/>&gt;  short octave on any keyboard instrument still doesn&apos;t constrain<br/>&gt;  anybody to use regular 1/4 on it, to the exclusion of other<br/>&gt;  systems.  What&apos;s to stop anyone from tuning a subsemitones keyboard<br/>&gt;  to regular 1/6 or anything else of one&apos;s fancy? (And the front half<br/>&gt;  and the back half would then be one Pyth comma apart....) The split<br/>&gt;  keys only provide an option to do some *different* note, and to<br/>&gt;  have either half be the higher-pitched half, to one&apos;s choosing. On<br/>&gt;  an organ, though, such things can&apos;t be changed day to day.</p><p>Please let me enthusiastically second this very important point, which<br/>indeed might easily get overlooked among the specifics of a discussion<br/>about the Yale organ. Interestingly, one historical tuning that very<br/>much comes to mind shares with your 1/6-comma example a set of split<br/>accidentals at Pythagorean comma apart: a 17-note Pythagorean tuning<br/>(Gb-A#) of the kind advocated by Prosdocimus de Beldemando and Ugolino<br/>or Orvieto in the earlier 15th century.</p><p>A keyboard supporting this 15th-century tuning scheme -- Lindley isn&apos;t<br/>sure if it might have been implemented at that time -- would also<br/>nicely support a modern 17-note circle, equal or unequal (as with<br/>George Secor&apos;s 17-WT). Or, of course, it could support 17 notes of any<br/>desired meantone temperament.</p><p>Again, I&apos;ve had experience only with a crude equivalent of real split<br/>keys: tuning certain keys on two 12-note MIDI keyboards to different<br/>notes, e.g. C# on the lower keyboard and Db on the upper, or F and E#,<br/>etc. I&apos;d suspect that even with the Ab-C-Eb complication you describe<br/>(if my curious preference for Eb and G# at the front is followed),<br/>actual split keys might be a bit easier than having to find the notes<br/>for such a sonority on two different manuals -- a good<br/>finger-stretching exercise, as I&apos;ve reminded myself trying it a moment<br/>ago.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@calweb.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2007 9:40:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Ozan,</p><p>Please let me thank you for your mention of 17-EDO and 34-EDO.

I very much agree, and might offer an illustration involving<br/>modal music.</p><p>Please let me say that I do this with great modesty, given that my<br/>range of experience both in composition and theory may be quite<br/>circumscribed compared to yours in many areas. Given that your focus<br/>is mainly tonal, and mine modal, it&apos;s interesting to ask how this<br/>might influence intonational preferences. Quite possibly, we might<br/>draw sometimes on similar interval sizes used in somewhat different<br/>contexts, just as two natural languages might have some similar<br/>phonemes used in quite distinct grammatical systems.</p><p>Given your mention of meantone, I thought I might again post an mp3<br/>file and PDF score for a piece, _Intrada in F Lydian_, which I linked<br/>to in an article of some weeks ago.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>If I were asked to describe the genre of this piece, I might say<br/>&quot;Manneristic,&quot; referring to the era of around 1540-1640 in European<br/>music. More specifically the piece uses a variation on Zarlino&apos;s<br/>2/7-comma meantone; but a listener might hear and recognize the<br/>general period style without focusing on this intonational aspect,<br/>much less the fact that this is a _modified_ meantone where the major<br/>third and sixth in Eb-G-C, for example, will be a full syntonic comma<br/>wider than in Zarlino&apos;s regular temperament.</p><p>While the intonational dimension is indeed meant to be significant, I<br/>suspect that many other aspects of counterpoint and harmony around<br/>1600 play a central role in shaping the piece. It would be quite<br/>possible to use a meantone (regular or modified) for some tonal music<br/>around 1720, say; but here the style would produce different results,<br/>even were the interval sizes quite similar.</p><p>A metaphor I am tempted to draw involves the early years of<br/>typesetting and page layout on personal computers, then widely<br/>celebrated as &quot;desktop publishing.&quot; A common refrain of experienced<br/>typesetters in that era, and even of some not-so-experienced ones, was<br/>that the main emphasis needed to be placed on desktop _publishing_.<br/>In others, simply learning a given software program was not a<br/>satisfactory substitute for the often more daunting task of mastering<br/>the craft of typography and graphic design.</p><p>Similarly, understanding or emulating the style of Nicola Vicentino<br/>involves more than understanding meantone tunings, enharmonic dieses<br/>or fifthtones in a temperament around 1/4-comma or 31-EDO, and the<br/>altered intervals which occur in a 31-note circle. The style is also<br/>shaped by the conventional patterns of 16th-century counterpoint and<br/>harmony to which Vicentino devotes much of his treatise of 1555.</p><p>Please let me say that although I recognize the merits of your<br/>observation that sometimes sticking to theoretical discussions avoids<br/>the possible sensitivities and even injuries that might arise when a<br/>given piece by a given participant becomes a focus for discussion, yet<br/>I would love to hear some of your music, whether posted here or<br/>available elsewhere. I am sure that it offers much enjoyment and<br/>education alike.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Magnus Jonsson &#x3C;magnus@smartelectronix.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2007 2:56:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, 5 Dec 2007, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf</a>&gt;</p><p>I like this!</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@calweb.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/2007 3:46:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Magnus,</p><p>Thank you warmly for your enthusiastic response to _Intrada in F<br/>Lydian_, and also your Web site, which includes some evidently very<br/>extended pieces that I look forward to hearing.</p><p>An essay by Siemen Terpstra which you have very helpfully made<br/>available on your site raises some issues about the potentials of<br/>modified meantone tunings, and how the resources of these tunings may<br/>resemble or different somewhat from those of 31-EDO or a very similar<br/>31-note circle of 1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>Currently I am exploring some of these questions in a composition<br/>using Zest-24, a tuning based on two 12-note circles of the modified<br/>meantone system used for the Intrada.

I recall<br/>hearing it in an undergraduate course in contemporary music --<br/>curiously, the one college course in music that I can recall taking.<br/>His music indeed sounded very distinctive, modern, and awesome.</p><p>Of course, I regard intonation as only one dimension of musicality,<br/>and by no means always the most significant in shaping a composer&apos;s or<br/>listener&apos;s sense of identity and affinity. Thus I would regard the<br/>neomodality of Debussy or Vaughan Williams as a shaping influence of<br/>my own music, for example, as well as the modality and quartal/quintal<br/>styles of Bartok, quite regardless of whether this music happens to be<br/>performed in 12-EDO or some other system.</p><p>Thus I express my great affection and appreciation to Stockhausen for<br/>having conceived of such unique and transforming edifices of sound --<br/>rather as I am enthralled by aural architectonics of Perotin. Of<br/>course, as Stockhausen&apos;s own use of intonational variation shows, a<br/>plurality of tuning systems can multiply the possibilities.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>webtrailer &#x3C;bryan45777@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2007 3:12:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>RE: I didn&apos;t know Wiki had a Microtonal page; thanx.<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Daniel (and All),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for your very thoughtful remarks about &quot;microtonality&quot; as<br/>&gt; one dimension of musical technique or choice rather than a discrete<br/>&gt; genre. I very much agree, and might offer an illustration involving<br/>&gt; modal music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me say that I do this with great modesty, given that my<br/>&gt; range of experience both in composition and theory may be quite<br/>&gt; circumscribed compared to yours in many areas. Given that your focus<br/>&gt; is mainly tonal, and mine modal, it&apos;s interesting to ask how this<br/>&gt; might influence intonational preferences. Quite possibly, we might<br/>&gt; draw sometimes on similar interval sizes used in somewhat different<br/>&gt; contexts, just as two natural languages might have some similar<br/>&gt; phonemes used in quite distinct grammatical systems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Given your mention of meantone, I thought I might again post an mp3<br/>&gt; file and PDF score for a piece, _Intrada in F Lydian_, which I<br/>linked<br/>&gt; to in an article of some weeks ago.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.mp3</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/IntradaFLydian.pdf</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I were asked to describe the genre of this piece, I might say<br/>&gt; &quot;Manneristic,&quot; referring to the era of around 1540-1640 in European<br/>&gt; music. More specifically the piece uses a variation on Zarlino&apos;s<br/>&gt; 2/7-comma meantone; but a listener might hear and recognize the<br/>&gt; general period style without focusing on this intonational aspect,<br/>&gt; much less the fact that this is a _modified_ meantone where the<br/>major<br/>&gt; third and sixth in Eb-G-C, for example, will be a full syntonic<br/>comma<br/>&gt; wider than in Zarlino&apos;s regular temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While the intonational dimension is indeed meant to be significant,<br/>I<br/>&gt; suspect that many other aspects of counterpoint and harmony around<br/>&gt; 1600 play a central role in shaping the piece. It would be quite<br/>&gt; possible to use a meantone (regular or modified) for some tonal<br/>music<br/>&gt; around 1720, say; but here the style would produce different<br/>results,<br/>&gt; even were the interval sizes quite similar.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A metaphor I am tempted to draw involves the early years of<br/>&gt; typesetting and page layout on personal computers, then widely<br/>&gt; celebrated as &quot;desktop publishing.&quot; A common refrain of experienced<br/>&gt; typesetters in that era, and even of some not-so-experienced ones,<br/>was<br/>&gt; that the main emphasis needed to be placed on desktop _publishing_.<br/>&gt; In others, simply learning a given software program was not a<br/>&gt; satisfactory substitute for the often more daunting task of<br/>mastering<br/>&gt; the craft of typography and graphic design.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Similarly, understanding or emulating the style of Nicola Vicentino<br/>&gt; involves more than understanding meantone tunings, enharmonic dieses<br/>&gt; or fifthtones in a temperament around 1/4-comma or 31-EDO, and the<br/>&gt; altered intervals which occur in a 31-note circle. The style is also<br/>&gt; shaped by the conventional patterns of 16th-century counterpoint and<br/>&gt; harmony to which Vicentino devotes much of his treatise of 1555.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me say that although I recognize the merits of your<br/>&gt; observation that sometimes sticking to theoretical discussions<br/>avoids<br/>&gt; the possible sensitivities and even injuries that might arise when a<br/>&gt; given piece by a given participant becomes a focus for discussion,<br/>yet<br/>&gt; I would love to hear some of your music, whether posted here or<br/>&gt; available elsewhere.

The basic Goya-17 features a set of<br/>major, minor, and neutral intervals with reference to a &quot;1/1&quot; of Db that<br/>somewhat resemble, but often radically differ from, a 17-tone circle such<br/>as George Secor&apos;s 17-WT. Generally major septimal intervals from Db are<br/>approximated using the chain of fifths on the lower keyboard, while the<br/>upper keyboard supplies approximations of minor septimal intervals and<br/>also neutral intervals, as explained more in the notes.</p><p>Supergoya-17plus3 adds some approximations of septimal ratios such as<br/>21:16 and 189:128. This makes some basic 17-tone-style resolutions<br/>available at more locations, but also facilitates idioms which favor<br/>sonorities such as 16:21:24:28 or the narrow and wide fourths and fifths<br/>(and octaves!) of gamelan.</p><p>Here&apos;s a link to this very rough sketch, more of an essay in progress<br/>than anything, but possibly curious to some here.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/letter-goya-supergoya.txt">http://www.bestII.com/~mschulter/letter-goya-supergoya.txt</a>&gt;</p><p>Also, here&apos;s a Scala file of a tuning set which I hope by some time early<br/>next year will have some mp3 files to illustrate its potentials -- from<br/>me, with others warmly encouraged to join in also if this system looks<br/>interesting.</p><p>! zest24-supergoya17plus3_Db.scl<br/>!<br/>Goya-17 plus 484, 676, and 1180 cents<br/> 20<br/>!<br/> 50.39062<br/> 171.09375<br/> 216.79688<br/> 267.18750<br/> 363.28125<br/> 433.59375<br/> 483.98437<br/> 503.90625<br/> 554.29688<br/> 625.78125<br/> 676.17187<br/> 707.81250<br/> 758.20312<br/> 867.18750<br/> 925.78125<br/> 976.17188<br/> 1059.37500<br/> 1129.68750<br/> 1180.07812<br/> 2/1</p><p>With many thanks, wishing happy holidays to all,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@calweb.com">mschulter@calweb.com</a></p></div><h3>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2008 1:53:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Margo Schulter &lt;mschulter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;.... it occurred to me that if the<br/>&gt; &quot;comma&quot; may be either Pythagorean or syntonic, with the schisma<br/>&gt; regarded as not so important, then why not 1/3-syntonic comma<br/>&gt; tempering for the narrow and wide fifths alike?</p><p>&gt; ! werckmeisterIV_variant.scl<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; Werckmeister IV with 1/3 syntonic comma temperings<br/>&gt;  12<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;  85.00995<br/>&gt;  196.74124<br/>&gt;  32/27<br/>&gt;  393.48248<br/>&gt;  4/3<br/>&gt;  45/32<br/>&gt;  694.78624<br/>&gt;  785.01123<br/>&gt;  891.52748<br/>&gt;  1003.25876<br/>&gt;  15/8<br/>&gt;  2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; !
