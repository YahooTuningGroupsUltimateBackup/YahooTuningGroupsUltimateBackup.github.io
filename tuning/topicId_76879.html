Many, if not most, of the discussions here about tuning theory concern the mathematics involved in constructing the systems, and the intricacies of decimal points. From my studies of tuning concepts in different cultures, I am struck by how Arabic, Indian, Chinese, Greek (especially Pythagoras), and most other cultures relate tuning theory to spiritual ideas and concepts. Numbers were always symbolic of larger and deeper Universal structures, and tunings were much more than just arrangements of notes. And of course, music itself was thought to have a deep Universal connection as well. I think something profound is lost when those elements are removed from tuning/music. None of those earlier cultures separated the math from the spiritual, not one. And today, those sorts of ideas are rarely, if ever, discussed concerning music or tuning systems.

Sounds like an interesting book; I&apos;ll have to check it out. One thing this whole discussion brings to mind is Douglas Hofstadter&apos;s book _G&iuml;&iquest;&half;del, Escher, Bach: The Eternal Golden Braid_. The book covers a range of seemingly disparate topics, but it somehow manages to hold it all together. The topic of G&iuml;&iquest;&half;del&apos;s incompleteness theorem does come up, but there is also discussion of Bach&apos;s music and Escher&apos;s unique style of art.</p><p>One of the things that Hofstadter comes up with is the idea of playing more than one piece of music from the same score. In one of the dialogues there&apos;s a pair of record players that produce a different piece of music from the same record: one of them plays a variation on the theme B-A-C-H, and the other one changes all the notes around so that it plays variations on the theme C-A-G-E. I&apos;m sure I must have had that in mind when I did the Warped Canon page. I wonder what he&apos;d think of mavila, swapping major for minor and minor for major?</p></div><h3><a id=76909 href="#76909">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/6/2008 12:08:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Just an observation...I am not trying to start a thread about<br/>this, but wanted to make a comment.

Amazing. Was just saying to<br/>microstick (is that your real name?) that the ancient Greek Harmonia<br/>meant unity between spirit and nature, political stability,<br/>mathematical order and logic, personal responsibility, and that this<br/>was all seen to be encoded in musical tunings. Wasn&apos;t it Kronecker,<br/>Cantors teacher/critic, who said that God created the natural numbers,<br/>mankind created the rest? Still, Cantors proofs seem much more<br/>spiritual to me than Betty and Jim arithmetic.</p></div>
