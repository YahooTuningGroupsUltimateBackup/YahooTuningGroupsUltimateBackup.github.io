Are you suggesting to use XML to drive a synthesis engine<br/>&gt; like CSound, Supercollider, Max, or something like that?</p><p>I&apos;m proposing using the tools provided by XML (elements (tags),<br/>attributes, content, processing instructions, properties, etc.) to create<br/>a thoroughly general musical notation, or language, in which it&apos;s possible<br/>to express anything that can be expressed in any existing musical<br/>notation, and maybe a few things that aren&apos;t.  (Such languages, built from<br/>the tools provided by XML, are called XML applications.)</p><p>One way in which such a language might be used is to drive synthesis<br/>engines, through what in XML parlance is called a &quot;processor&quot;, a program<br/>that works with XML files for a particular purpose.  (Editors and<br/>browsers are also processors.)</p><p>&gt; I catch that you dont mean to use it as a standardized notation for<br/>&gt; performers, not sure how that would work anyway?</p><p>Probably not, but it could be used to drive displays for performers,<br/>through a different sort of processor, and it could also be used to<br/>produce sheet music, much as a word processing file can produce a<br/>nicely formatted document.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m a prgogrammer but I&apos;ve never used XML.
