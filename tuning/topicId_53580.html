They may represent<br/>equivalence along a chroma dimension but certainly can matter when it<br/>comes to smoothness. If you compare 12/7 or 24/7 vs. 7/3 I think<br/>you&apos;ll hear it.</p><p>So the correct comparison would be between</p><p>5/3 = 5^1 * 3^-1<br/>and<br/>15/8 = 5^1 * 3^1 * 2^-3</p><p>and 15/8 looks more complex, as it should.</p><p>The second way is to follow Harry Partch and Kees van Prooijen --<br/>I&apos;ve explained this method in detail before. Here, octave equivalence<br/>is indeed considered to apply fully -- admittedly, a simplification,<br/>which is made to aid the composer&apos;s conceptualizing. But the<br/>complexity is then given by the largest *odd* factor in either the<br/>numerator or denominator. So 5/3 is considered a &quot;ratio of 5&quot; by<br/>Partch, while 15/8 is considered a &quot;ratio of 15&quot;. And again, 15/8<br/>looks more complex, as it should.</p></div><h3><a id=53586 href="#53586">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2004 10:45:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 16/5 = 15/8 is a problem, but this is only because 16/15 is so<br/>small.<br/>&gt; Most toy complexity measures run into this problem, which we call<br/>&gt; SPAN.</p><p>Once again, I totally disagree with this assessment/definition of<br/>SPAN.

I think is less subjective that the chord: 1/1, 3/2, 9/4<br/>is much less complex than any other chords which includes 7/5.</p><p>In any case is strange that 9/4 has to be considered more complex<br/>than 7/4. This contraddicts the &quot;limit&quot; concept which is normally<br/>assumed in tuning discussion. This implies a clear choice between<br/>prime or odd numbers as measure of complexity.</p><p>&gt;15/12 is not a real ratio -- it reduces to 5/4. So yes, &quot;15/12&quot; is<br/>&gt;much simpler, as the numbers 5 and 4 are much smaller than 13 and<br/>11.</p><p>This means that odd numbers measure does&apos;nt work with unreducted<br/>ratios. This is strange since a ratio manteins his characteristics<br/>even if not reducted. I think a good complexity measure would have<br/>to work in these cases too.</p><p>This happens when you measure complexity as a combination of primes<br/>and exponents:</p><p>9/4 = 2^-2 x 3^2<br/>7/5 = 2^0 x 3^0 x 5^-1 x 7^1</p><p>15/12 = 2^-2 x 3^(1-1) x 5^1<br/>13/11 = 2^0 x 3^0 x 5^0 x 7^0 x 11^-1 x 13^1</p><p>Complexity has to do with the &quot;digestibility&quot; of prime numbers.<br/>To understand you can think to the growing rhythmic complexity<br/>between a couple of notes, a triplet of them, a quintlet (not<br/>sure this is the right word...), a septlet (?)....</p><p>Is not possible to subdivide a prime numbers in simpler parts. So<br/>the ear has to &quot;eat it&quot; in one bite only. To me this is the base of<br/>ratio complexity.</p><p>&gt;If I compare _pure_ (not 12-equal) 5/3 or 5/4 vs. 9/8 or 16/9,<br/>&gt;there&acute;s no question that the ratios of 5 sound simpler.</p><p>This is true but the cause is the ear perceptive model which implies<br/>the critical bandwith: any intervals smaller than a minor third is<br/>not well received by the ear. This don&apos;t have to do with<br/>digestibility of prime numbers and ratio complexity.<br/>This is not relative to the object of perception but to the subject.<br/>Not to what you ear but to your ear.</p><p>&gt;&iquest;What prevents you from going on to 32/27 and 27/16?<br/>&gt;&iquest;What prevents you from going on to 25/16, 25/24, 45/32, etc.?<br/>&gt;&iquest;What about 7/4, 7/6, 9/7, 21/16, etc.?</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that the intervals I purpose are the only possible.<br/>I just think that these derives one from the other in a natural way<br/>and that this has, at the same time, an harmonic and melodic scope.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I think harmony&apos;s history is slowly going down on this circle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In 12-equal, you can&acute;t even distinguish 9/5 from 16/9, for example<br/>&gt;so whatever &acute;circle&acute; you&acute;re referring to with JI ratios can&acute;t really<br/>&gt;apply to the Western musical system.</p><p>12-equal is the end of an historic path. Tunings born for an<br/>harmonic use are developed on circle of fifths.<br/>Pitagoric tuning (which includes also some of the intervals you<br/>wrote) is based on 3-limit; then some of these intervals were<br/>substituted by 5-limits intervals through a syntonic comma shift:<br/>zarlino tuning for example. Meantone tunings are attempts to build a<br/>good circle of fifths around a fundamental note respecting 5-limits<br/>harmony. Circle of fifths represents the model that the ear has used<br/>to reach 12-equal which is the base of our western system.</p><p>Is possible to go ahead with this cicle from the bottom, introducing<br/>other ratios as 21/20 and 40/21, 11/7 and 14/11, 13/11 and 22/13.<br/>Naturally this prosecution determines the use of other tempered<br/>systems as 19-et for example.</p><p>&gt;And as far as the circle of fifths, two steps (i.e., major seconds<br/>&gt;and minor sevenths) were certainly not accepted as stable harmonies<br/>&gt;for centuries while major and minor thirds and sixths were. So even<br/>&gt;that part of your theory doesn&acute;t seem to hold up.</p><p>This is due to critical bandwith. Triads are the only chords without<br/>seconds and sevenths (assuming octave doubles). From this  derives<br/>the development of thirds harmony. But, for example, a sixth with a<br/>fifth is something more recent, even if these intervals are both<br/>consonant in triadic harmony.</p><p>In any case I think that, so as 3/2 is the more ancient harmonic<br/>principle after octave, 9/8 is the more ancient melodic principle.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Each passage to a new prime produces a &quot;comma&quot;.

So even<br/>&gt; &gt;that part of your theory doesn&acute;t seem to hold up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is due to critical bandwith.</p><p>This is a misassessment of the critical band phenomenon. One needs to<br/>proceed a little more carefully to determine its effect, and its<br/>result on dyads is, as calculated in many published papers and books,<br/>related to the *size* of the numbers in the reduced ratios, and not<br/>at all to factorability, when one is comparing intervals tunable by<br/>eliminating critical band roughness.</p><p>&gt; Triads are the only chords without<br/>&gt; seconds and sevenths (assuming octave doubles). From this  derives<br/>&gt; the development of thirds harmony.</p><p>If you mean triads, then I agree that you have reached a somewhat<br/>valid conclusion. But timbre, and most of all musical style, are huge<br/>variables in this assessment.</p><p>&gt; But, for example, a sixth with a<br/>&gt; fifth is something more recent, even if these intervals are both<br/>&gt; consonant in triadic harmony.</p><p>That&apos;s largely because of that complex *second* existing in the<br/>chord. It&apos;s the complexity of *all* the dyads, not just some of them,<br/>that contributed to chordal complexity.</p><p>&gt; In any case I think that, so as 3/2 is the more ancient harmonic<br/>&gt; principle after octave, 9/8 is the more ancient melodic principle.</p><p>4/3 more ancient still, I think. Meanwhile, melodic seconds of all<br/>sizes are found throughout the world&apos;s musics, and 9/8 are favored in<br/>comparatively few of them.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Each passage to a new prime produces a &quot;comma&quot;.

Of course this comma has been the center of a huge<br/>amount of discussion. Where did you get the name?</p><p>&gt; &gt;There are far more commas than this, even if you don&acute;t go to higher<br/>&gt; &gt;primes. 32805/32768 is one of the more important ones with all<br/>&gt; &gt;primes 5 and below, while prime 7 introduces such commas as 64/63,<br/>&gt; &gt;126/125, 225/224, 2401/2400, and 4375/4374, to name but a few.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not saying that the commas I&apos;ve showed are the only possible.<br/>&gt; I just think that these derives one from the other in a natural way<br/>&gt; and that this has, at the same time, an harmonic and melodic scope.</p><p>So do many non-diatonic systems, as I&apos;ll show you after about 5 days.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Commas apart any new ratio<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; is obtained just with the powers of three (and the rearrangement<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; in the same octave with powers of two).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Not sure what this means.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Circle of fifths represents the powers of number three shifted in<br/>&gt; some points of a comma.</p><p>So one of the terms in what you would consider a &quot;comma&quot; has to be<br/>a &quot;Pythagorean&quot; term? This is similar to Dave Keenan and George<br/>Secor&apos;s &quot;notational&quot; commas, but I would argue that those don&apos;t have<br/>to be the only relevant ones for music.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&iquest;But here, you&acute;re basically assuming a 12-equal grid that<br/>&gt; everything snaps to,<br/>&gt; &gt;yes? &iquest;Since this is the alternative tuning list, I wonder if you<br/>&gt; &gt;actually might have some other tuning system than 12-equal in mind?<br/>&gt; &gt;It isn&acute;t quite clear from what you write.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m trying to understand causes of 12-equal to better undestand how<br/>&gt; to use other et systems as 19, 5, 31, 7....</p><p>Great -- I think in 5 days I will be able to help you a lot!</p><p>It&apos;s a real pleasure talking to you.

Where did you get the name?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;There are far more commas than this, even if you don&acute;t go to<br/>higher<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;primes. 32805/32768 is one of the more important ones with all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;primes 5 and below, while prime 7 introduces such commas as<br/>64/63,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;126/125, 225/224, 2401/2400, and 4375/4374, to name but a few.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not saying that the commas I&apos;ve showed are the only possible.<br/>&gt; &gt; I just think that these derives one from the other in a natural<br/>way<br/>&gt; &gt; and that this has, at the same time, an harmonic and melodic<br/>scope.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So do many non-diatonic systems, as I&apos;ll show you after about 5<br/>days.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Commas apart any new ratio<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is obtained just with the powers of three (and the<br/>rearrangement<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in the same octave with powers of two).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Not sure what this means.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Circle of fifths represents the powers of number three shifted in<br/>&gt; &gt; some points of a comma.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So one of the terms in what you would consider a &quot;comma&quot; has to be<br/>&gt; a &quot;Pythagorean&quot; term? This is similar to Dave Keenan and George<br/>&gt; Secor&apos;s &quot;notational&quot; commas, but I would argue that those don&apos;t<br/>have<br/>&gt; to be the only relevant ones for music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&iquest;But here, you&acute;re basically assuming a 12-equal grid that<br/>&gt; &gt; everything snaps to,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;yes? &iquest;Since this is the alternative tuning list, I wonder if you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;actually might have some other tuning system than 12-equal in<br/>mind?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;It isn&acute;t quite clear from what you write.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m trying to understand causes of 12-equal to better undestand<br/>how<br/>&gt; &gt; to use other et systems as 19, 5, 31, 7....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Great -- I think in 5 days I will be able to help you a lot!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a real pleasure talking to you.

Seldom<br/>&gt; more than 9 unless you count passing tones.

Hanson and schismic are, of<br/>course, far more accurate in their tuning, with 53 the happy medium<br/>able to accomodate both. Hanson is also a 72-et system, which is a<br/>consideration for some people.

You run across it pretty quickly when doing any kind of triadic harmony involving progressions of fifths, so it can be useful to sort temperaments according to what they do with 81/80 (some temperaments actually make it wider, and one version of 64-ET makes it go negative, for instance). You could also say that about 25/24 and 135/128 (I have a particular interest in 135/128), but their use is more limited, and the harmony produced by tempering out these commas is noticeably less smooth than meantone. 32805/32768 only starts being of interest with relatively large scales of 12 or more notes, and then you have to be careful to avoid progressions that run into the 81/80 (unless of course you&apos;re in 12-ET). 15625/15552 is a nice comma, and the 11-note scale that tempers it out has a lot of harmonic and melodic potential (you also tend not to run into the 81/80 problem with it so much, since root movement by fifths is limited when it takes 6 generators of the temperament to reach one fifth). Even some of the more exotic commas like 27/25 or 2187/2048 are not without their uses. Still, it&apos;s _really_ hard to beat meantone as a general-purpose 5-limit temperament. 2048/2025 is probably the best alternative; it also works well with root movement by fifths and the complexity of the scales is not too bad for the extra accuracy. Certainly it seems to have the advantage in the 7-limit.</p><p>(As far as 7-limit commas go, there are a number of nice choices; it&apos;s hard to decide between 50/49, 64/63, 126/125, and 225/224.)</p></div><h3><a id=53722 href="#53722">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2004 11:42:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; Carl seems to be implying much the same thing about 81:80 here:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/music/theory/tctmo/">http://lumma.org/music/theory/tctmo/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It seems to me that what he is saying is, more or less, that 81/80 is<br/>&gt;the smallest superparticular 5-limit comma.

You run<br/>across it<br/>&gt; pretty quickly when doing any kind of triadic harmony involving<br/>&gt; progressions of fifths, so it can be useful to sort temperaments<br/>&gt; according to what they do with 81/80 (some temperaments actually<br/>make it<br/>&gt; wider, and one version of 64-ET makes it go negative, for instance).</p><p>As does the usual version of 21-tET.</p><p>&gt; Still, it&apos;s _really_ hard to beat meantone<br/>&gt; as a general-purpose 5-limit temperament. 2048/2025 is probably the<br/>best<br/>&gt; alternative;</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sure I agree with this, and I&apos;m inclining toward calling<br/>the latter temperament &quot;srutal&quot; (instead of &quot;diaschismic&quot;), since its<br/>22-tone omitetrachordal scale is virtually identical with the Indian<br/>Shruti scale.</p></div><h3><a id=53731 href="#53731">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2004 12:52:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ...how can I make it clearer, or what am I being asked?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;My guess, only that, is that you were saying that 81/80 is the<br/>&gt; &gt;smallest superparticular 5-limit comma, among other things.
