It was like getting blood out of a stone. :-) Paul really didn&apos;t want to discuss it because he quite understandably didn&apos;t want to take sides in what had previously been a somewhat acrimonious discussion. But I pushed and prodded until eventually I think I came up with something useful.</p><p>Here is the (slightly edited) text of my final message to Paul on the topic, which he has asked me to share with you.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>DK:<br/>&gt;&gt;What do you call that perceptual property that an 8:11 +-0.5c has, but a<br/>&gt;&gt;35:48 does not (assuming a suitable harmonic timbre)? &quot;Consonant&quot; won&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;do. Many people agree with me that while a bare 8:11 may be JI, it is a &gt;&gt;stretch to call it consonant.</p><p>PE:<br/>&gt;It&apos;s a form of concordance. I&apos;d tend to spell out the fact that it has<br/>&gt;nearly coinciding partials.</p><p>DK:<br/>Well Paul, I have to say I have very little respect for this position. I really don&apos;t think many people who hear them (with a suitable harmonic timbre) would have trouble agreeing that 8:11 +-0.5c is a justly intoned super-fourth while 35:48 is a super-fourth which is not justly intoned, in the same way as they would agree that a 4:5 +-0.5c is a justly intoned major third while a 64:81 is not.</p><p>DK:<br/>&gt;&gt;So you would say &quot;64:81 is JI when it is in a Pythagorean scale&quot;.</p><p>PE:<br/>&gt;Agnostic.</p><p>DK:<br/>&gt;&gt;But what could &quot;JI&quot; stand for here, if not &quot;justly intoned&quot;?</p><p>PE:<br/>&gt;Just Intonation.</p><p>DK:<br/>That doesn&apos;t even seem quite gramatically correct &quot;The interval 64:81 is just intonation&quot;? What could this mean?</p><p>So, do you respect the view of people who say that some interval is JI (just intonation) merely because it is in a Pythagorean (or other JI) tuning system? Despite the fact that _any_ interval will be within 0.5c (or whatever tolerance you like) of some interval in such a system, if it is sufficently extended.</p><p>And what about that &quot;or other JI [system]&quot; above. We both agree that Pythagorean systems are JI systems. But how do you decide (or how do you think these people decide) what is a JI tuning system in general. They can&apos;t logically use JI intervals to define JI systems, since they have already used JI systems to define JI intervals. That is unless _some_ JI intervals are defined without reference to JI systems, in which case _those_ JI intervals are somewhat special aren&apos;t they? And they deserve a different adjective don&apos;t they?</p><p>It seems that people use the abbreviation &quot;JI&quot; in a very ambiguous manner when using it as an adjective to describe intervals or chords. It can be an abbreviation for either &quot;justly intoned&quot; (the perceptual property) or &quot;just-intonation-systemic&quot; (i.e. contained within a just intonation system). This leads to a great deal of confusion, particularly for the poor newbies. I think the tuning list can do better than to allow this confusing state of affairs to continue. And I think it can be addressed without acrimony.</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t it be a lot simpler and less confusing to agree that those special intervals (such as 4:5 +-some tolerance) are the justly intoned intervals (= JI intervals) while the others (such as 64:81 +-some tolerance) are merely just intonation system intervals (= JI-system intervals or JI-scale intervals = JIS intervals).</p><p>I think JIS is a better term than RI because it allows that these intervals may have a tolerance too, and don&apos;t have to be precisely rational (which can only be achieved by extraordinary digital means in any case).<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Just so we know what we&apos;re talking about, the following URL is for a graph that models quite well, my perception of the justness (JI-ness) of intervals using typical harmonic timbres. I&apos;d prefer not to tell you how it was derived until after you&apos;ve had a look at it and thought about how well it models _your_ perception of justness.
