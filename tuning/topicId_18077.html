It&apos;s<br/>fairly common to tailor inharmonicity in piano design or redesign, I&apos;ve<br/>started also to integrate its effect to pitches ultimately that I&apos;ll<br/>tune (more than anything, out of obstinacy), otherwise which would be<br/>theoretical frequencies. Since string inharmonicity varies with wire<br/>material, tension, length, section and I guess loading (maybe even<br/>bridge admittance) the effect is a compass of micro-timbers: partials<br/>sharping increasingly up the plain wire scale, if bridged fairly well to<br/>the highest wound strings usually sharping again toward the lowest.<br/>Well, nothing a little length couldn&apos;t fix...</p><p>Clark</p></div>
