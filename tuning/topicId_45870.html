If you are bypassing the soundcard, where is<br/>the &quot;output&quot; coming from that you are sending to headphones or amp?  Perhaps<br/>you just meant to bypass the amp built into the soundcard?  I&apos;ve never owned<br/>a soundcard that had any kind of amp (in the sense of power amp) built in -<br/>all have had line-level outputs, and at this point I&apos;ve owned 4 different<br/>sound cards, though a couple of years ago I switched from using sound cards<br/>to using external USB and Firewire audio interfaces, so maybe things have<br/>changed.</p><p>&gt; Another is to wait until ogg players hit the market, I<br/>&gt; suppose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any other suggestions from those more knowledgeable than me?</p><p>(Gene, now I understand where you were coming from, with your &quot;burn a CD&quot;<br/>suggestions.)</p><p>I would expect that most 16-bit soundcards are &quot;pretty good&quot; nowadays, and<br/>probably at least _minimally_ adequate for the purpose of hearing tunings<br/>through ogg files, provided you connect the sound card up to an external<br/>amplifier with some decent speakers (or headphones, if you like).</p><p>However, the signal-to-noise ratio from your sound card may be a fair bit<br/>worse than your CD player, so when you crank it up through your external amp<br/>you will have both more hiss and more distortion in the quieter passages<br/>than would be acceptable for &quot;hi fi&quot; purposes. (Chances are the hiss will<br/>drown out the distortion.)</p><p>But if you are seriously into computer music, then why not bite the bullet<br/>and get a professional quality sound card or else an audio interface that<br/>sits outside your computer and connects to it via USB or Firewire?  With<br/>this route you are likely to get sound quality that approaches or exceeds<br/>what you are used to hearing from your CD player.</p><p>If your listening to computer-originated audio is rare, then this does not<br/>apply to you, and burning an occasional CD may not be a problem.  But if you<br/>are listening to audio from the web on a regular basis, then at least<br/>connecting your computer (with its existing sound card or sound &quot;on the<br/>motherboard&quot;) to your stereo system is a worthy thing.  And if you are doing<br/>it a lot, and you are serious about it, then spending a few hundred to get<br/>professional quality sound out of your computer may also be a worthy thing.<br/>Then you can just click on a link and listen, which is ideal, if you can<br/>afford it.</p><p>Moderately good USB audio interfaces can be had for 400USD or so, and very<br/>good FireWire audio interfaces for as little as 700USD.  Last I heard the<br/>MOTU 828 was selling at Guitar Center for $699.</p><p>When you buy one of these professional interfaces you are likely buying more<br/>channels than you have need for.  8 output channels for a FireWire interface<br/>and 4 to 6 for a USB interface are typical.  But if you want the quality,<br/>that&apos;s what you have to do, so just ignore the extra channels and connect<br/>your amp up to channels 1 and 2.</p><p>In any case the first step would be to connect your sound card up to an amp,<br/>and see how bad it is.  Maybe this will be good enough for your purposes.<br/>Still you can burn a CD now and then when you want to hear a particularly<br/>piece in higher fidelity.  But in the mean time you can at least *audition*<br/>oggs and MP3s off the web with amplified computer audio, so that you know<br/>what is worth burning a CD of.</p><p>Meanwhile, the G5 Macs that are coming out in a month or so have built-in<br/>optical digital audio connections, so you can run an optical cable from your<br/>computer direct into your 5.1 surround system&apos;s optical input.  Then we can<br/>work on Gene to start producing sound files that can take advantage of your<br/>surround system--but I don&apos;t know that 5.1 MP3 or OGG formats exist yet.</p><p>-Kurt Bigler</p></div><h3><a id=45874 href="#45874">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2003 1:37:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; on 7/27/03 3:06 AM, Gene Ward Smith &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Not sure what you mean here.

You might try<br/>to arrange having a dedicated USB bus, because USB can not guarantee<br/>continuous throughput to any single device when other devices are present on<br/>the same bus.  I think some computers with multiple USB connectors on the<br/>back have each one on a separate bus, but this is not the norm.</p><p>For some people USB audio works fine however, and this might work fine for<br/>you.</p><p>If you have any inclination toward &quot;high end&quot; you might be better off<br/>getting an interface with balanced outputs (rather than RCA), to allow<br/>connecting to pro amplifiers with balanced inputs, in order to eliminate<br/>possible hum problems.  These problems tend to be causes mostly by ground<br/>loops, but eliminating ground loops between computers and audio equipment is<br/>no easy trick, or so I have found.</p><p>Also I think it is harder (or more expensive) to isolate the audio gear from<br/>interference originating from digital activity on the USB bus.  This is one<br/>problem that crops up and which will be worse with USB than firewire, and<br/>worse with RCA than with balanced outputs.</p><p>If you try one, you might want to make sure what the return policy is, and<br/>how much time you have to try it and return it if necessary.</p><p>Good luck.  Chances are this will be better.  But I&apos;m concerned that a USB<br/>solution might not be that much better than a good 2-year old sound card.<br/>You might also look for a used MOTO 828 or something.</p><p>I had trouble with hum myself with almost every device I used, except when<br/>using balanced outputs.  The single exception is the Metric Halo Mobile I/O<br/>2882, which support a cabling method that optimizes the use of the<br/>unbalanced outputs.  But those boxes are very steep, probably outside of<br/>your range.</p><p>On the other hand these solutions that provide integrated 5.1 capability may<br/>give you better value in the long run, if you have or expect to obtain a 5.1<br/>system.  That way there is no hum issue at all, since you have direct<br/>digital into your amp.  In fact if you don&apos;t have one you might at this<br/>point be able to get a used 5.1-capable receiver on eBay or such for not<br/>much money at all.</p><p>You need to be sophisticated about your synthesis/recording level setting.<br/>In a synthesis situation you have the ideal situation actually since you can<br/>presumably reproduce the entire synthesis at a different level with little<br/>effort.  Using Carl&apos;s solution of mastering to 24-bit also is a great way to<br/>avoid that whole problem.  Then with the right software you should be able<br/>to generate oggs with optimal levels automatically.</p><p>Good luck.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=45890 href="#45890">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2003 8:58:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I get excellent fidelity with headphones and the 6GB of sound files<br/>&gt; I have.</p><p>If this were true, you would not have made any complaints about low<br/>sound volume, which is a classic symptom of a computer soundcard not<br/>up to the job.
