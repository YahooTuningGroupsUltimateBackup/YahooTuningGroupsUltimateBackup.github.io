If<br/>my discussion of neo-Gothic music can encourage new experiments and<br/>performances, that would be most rewarding, especially I hope for the<br/>performers and listeners.</p><p>Very briefly, I might just propose these possible distinctions, since<br/>I recognize that terms like &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; and &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; may often<br/>seem synonymous, and in fact overlap (&quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; being one approach to<br/>the larger category of neo-Gothic).</p><p>--------------<br/>1. Xeno-Gothic<br/>--------------</p><p>Xeno-Gothic refers specifically to a 24-note Pythagorean tuning with<br/>two 12-note keyboards a Pythagorean comma apart, as used for music of<br/>13th-14th century Gothic Europe and related derivative styles. Here<br/>I would emphasize that it is not the tuning alone which is<br/>&quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; -- Euler apparently proposed a similar if not identical<br/>arrangement in 1739 (according to Barbour) for a kind of 5-limit just<br/>intonation -- but the use of this tuning for Gothic or derivative<br/>styles.</p><p>More specifically, this implies an outlook where generally the regular<br/>Pythagorean intervals are the usual norm, with a characteristic focus<br/>also on the &quot;near-7-limit&quot; intervals in cadential progressions to<br/>stable 3-limit sonorities. Certainly the &quot;near-5-limit&quot; intervals can<br/>play a role also, especially in early 15th-century idioms and their<br/>offshoots, but the overall outlook is &quot;complex 3-limit, with<br/>interesting variations.&quot;</p><p>-------------<br/>2. Neo-Gothic<br/>-------------</p><p>Generally &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; refers to any kind of tuning or musical style<br/>derived from Gothic music in a reasonably recognizable fashion. Within<br/>this larger category, Xeno-Gothic is one subset.</p><p>(1) Xeno-Gothic JI. More specifically, Xeno-Gothic is a just<br/>intonation (JI) system based on 3-prime-limit intervals -- as is<br/>Pythagorean tuning in general. As a matter of convenience, Xeno-Gothic<br/>uses a 24-note chain fitting two standard 12-note keyboards, but the<br/>scheme might be extended to a full and &quot;virtually closed&quot; cycle of 53<br/>notes.</p><p>(2) Other JI systems. Another JI approach to neo-Gothic might be the<br/>use of arrays of intervals including pure ratios at higher prime<br/>limits such as 7:6, 9:7, 13:11, 14:11, 17:14, 21:17, and so on.</p><p>(3) Neo-Gothic regular temperaments. Neo-Gothic hypermeantone tunings<br/>with fifths larger than Pythagorean, ranging out to around 22-tet and<br/>in some special circumstances to 27-tet, are counterparts of<br/>traditional meantones with fifths narrower than pure. Such tunings,<br/>also like meantones, may be precisely closed (n-tet&apos;s) or open.<br/>Familiar examples might include 17-tet, 22-tet, 27-tet, 29-tet,<br/>41-tet, and 46-tet. Note that 53-tet, although not a hypermeantone<br/>since its fifths are minutely smaller than Pythagorean, also serves as<br/>a regular temperament closely approximating Pythagorean JI.</p><p>(4) Neo-Gothic irregular temperaments. Like the late 17th-19th century<br/>well-temperaments, these tunings would feature regular fifths of more<br/>than one size. As Paul Erlich has pointed out in a Baroque context,<br/>such tunings need not be limited to 12 notes per octave, although the<br/>historical term &quot;well-temperament&quot; often implies this tuning size.</p><p>(5) Adaptive JI systems. As Paul Erlich recently noted, one could use<br/>a tuning such as 1/4-septimal-comma hypermeantone (fifths ~6.82 cents<br/>flat, major thirds at a pure 9:7) or 22-tet as the basis for an<br/>adaptive tuning system making adjustments so that vertical sonorities<br/>might, for example, have consistently pure 3-limit and 7-limit ratios.<br/>Such a scheme would be analogous to that taking 1/4-comma meantone or<br/>31-tet as the basis for adjustments to obtain pure 3-limit and 5-limit<br/>ratios (in the manner of Nicola Vicentino, 1555, and Erlich).</p><p>Please feel welcome to ask more questions: I know that it is often<br/>easier for me to use terms such as &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; or &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; than<br/>to define them clearly, especially here when one term may represent<br/>the subset of another.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
