I never seen anything to suggest it reflects any<br/>deep structure in music (as its presentation would imply).  I view it as a<br/>simple descriptive language, which may be reasonably compact when applied<br/>to the music it was based on, but which I find useless for examples like<br/>the ones I gave.</p><p>Once again, this is something I would find quite reasonable if it was<br/>presented as a descriptive effort, but something which I find quite<br/>laughable when presented as a constructive effort -- with the cock of a<br/>chin, no less, in 4 out of 5 cases (in my experience).</p><p>That said, I am prepared to be corrected.  In Berkeley I will once again be<br/>near a library, and I will try to check out some Mathieu.  I will post a<br/>full retraction here if I like it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
