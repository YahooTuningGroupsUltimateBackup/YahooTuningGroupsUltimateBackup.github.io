Because it&apos;s easier to tell the direction of<br/>the alteration (from pythagorean) if the slanted line is combined<br/>with a vertical line to form a semi-arrow.</p><p>This example is in JI, but the same 5-comma symbol pair is used for a<br/>single-degree alteration of 41-ET (and 22, 46, 53, and 72, for that<br/>matter).  So you see that the *harmonic* meaning of the symbol *does<br/>not change* when the tuning changes.</p><p>--George</p></div>
