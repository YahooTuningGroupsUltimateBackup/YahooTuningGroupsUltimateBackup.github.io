But that also allows it to<br/>be readilly harrassed on these as other periods</p><p>Note that I have a bit of a problem thinking this<br/>way since the application of a # or b will alter<br/>notes that are not octave equivalent. Whatever...</p><p>      6<br/>    5   1<br/>  4   1 1 etc down to chromatic</p><p>      4<br/>    3   1 the octave extended version (313131) is<br/>          sometimes called the augmented scale. Note<br/>          how a #/b turns it to (131313)<br/>  2  1  1 (this one looks sort of cool, 211211211)</p><p>      3<br/>    2   1 the octave extended version (21212121) is<br/>          the diminished scale, apply a sharp and<br/>          it rotates 12121212</p><p>I guess thats it for 12.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But my comfort had come from playing with MOS in other<br/>&gt; &gt; EDOs (on paper) and watching the same sort of system<br/>&gt; &gt; pop out as diatonic mapped into 12. So it really was<br/>&gt; &gt; coming from a different language and viewpoint even if<br/>&gt; &gt; I thought it matched up with his &quot;vision&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ok, you got me interested.  you&apos;ve probably posted this<br/>&gt; kind of stuff before and i skipped it ... sorry.  any<br/>&gt; examples of &quot;MOS in other EDOs&quot; you can give now?<br/>&gt; others may feel free to respond to this too.</p><p>Mats has been exploring this stuff with a lot more musical<br/>output than I have. Certainly one of the most talked about<br/>MOS in other EDOs here has been &apos;Blackjack&apos; which in 72<br/>is</p><p> 252525252525252525252 (I would call a 21.10)</p><p>which is the child of the Miracle MOS (11.1)</p><p>   77777777772 (again in 72)</p><p>Another well-discussed MOS is the neutral third scale<br/>which I consider a 7.3. In 31 it&apos;s</p><p>  5445454</p><p>which can be rationalized as</p><p>1/1 9/8 11/9 4/3 3/2 18/11 20/11 2/1</p><p>This is all part of the &quot;search for a white note<br/>scale&quot; and I came to it mostly interested in octave<br/>periods so that transposition would be very much<br/>like the traditional diatonic.</p><p>So...</p><p>5445454  # = 5-4 = 1</p><p>goes to</p><p>5454454</p><p>An n.2 will rotate somewhere around the half octave,<br/>like the traditional diatonic. An n.3 will rotate<br/>somewhere near the third of an octave, which makes<br/>the modulatory cycle fundamentally different in sound,<br/>though similar in concept.</p><p>After grinding away at this stuff, I found that my<br/>playing was much more modal than modulatory, and<br/>that this feature may nbe less important than I;d<br/>thought. We&apos;ll see when I have all 31 tones at my<br/>disposal.</p><p>Another thing, in the same way that some of the<br/>coolest things happen to the diatonic by applying<br/>the # or flat to the &quot;wrong note&quot; (harmonic minor<br/>and melodic minor as represented in 12 are exactly<br/>this), this holds true for alterations of MOS in<br/>other EDOs.</p><p>Paul has mentioned Pajara??? which in 31 is</p><p>5445544</p><p>an alteration of the 7.3 MOS. This may be a more<br/>practical scale than its parent.</p><p>So any EDO can have a tree extended in this manner<br/>and produce a variety of interesting and other<br/>offspring. Lastly, I should abandon my notation (n.m)<br/>since it is so unspecific (for instance, what is<br/>larger and what is smaller).</p><p>Bob</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p></div><h3><a id=34111 href="#34111">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2002 12:48:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Paul has mentioned Pajara??? which in 31 is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5445544<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; an alteration of the 7.3 MOS.</p><p>how is that pajara? it&apos;s the arabic diatonic, as far as i can see.</p></div>
