I am spontaneously<br/>both unwilling and unable to do more than declare that the music and the<br/>instructions in the score must speak for themselves.  Perhaps I could point<br/>out that it involves human beings and is contemporary (and) that the<br/>geographical pinpointing of the title might be an individual whim.  I might<br/>also say that the work is conceptually imaginary rather than fictionally<br/>imaginary.  Finally, it is a summation of factors that I cannot feel<br/>impelled&mldr;..to battle over or to interpret.</p><p>This asks a great deal from a performing ensemble: to have sufficient faith<br/>to carry it through the excessive demands of rehearsal without a verbally<br/>expressed dramatic idea to hold on to, and without assurance of compensating<br/>esthetic rewards in the final reckoning.  Yet, if the words were frankly a<br/>sonata, there would be no expectation by the musicians of more than a slowly<br/>revealed musical concept, and the rewards of passages pleasurable to play.<br/>Perhaps for the purposes of rehearsal only, the work should temporarily be<br/>titled: The Incident at Drake&apos;s Bay.</p><p>Now, discuss amongst yourselves.

Johnny</p><p>Here we have Partch jotting down notes about a proposed piece that<br/>never came to fruition. He specifically states:</p><p>&quot;I am spontaneously both unwilling and unable to do more than declare<br/>that the music and the instructions in the score must speak for<br/>themselves.&quot;</p><p>He never produced music for this piece, therefore no score, therefore<br/>no instructions; they cannot &quot;speak for themselves&quot;. It is<br/>interesting (for those who care about these things) to see someone<br/>like this &apos;working out&apos; on paper the thoughts in his head, and it is<br/>also a very early indication of the importance of including a<br/>drammatic or theatrical underpinning to the work. Had it been a<br/>project of high priority with him, or something deep inside that<br/>moved him, my guess is that we would have eventually actually *had* a<br/>Partch work entitled &quot;Incident at Drake&apos;s Bay&quot;.</p><p>But what we have is a glimpse at one artist&apos;s rumminations. If people<br/>will make more of it than that, it is because the work can&apos;t &quot;speak<br/>for itself&quot;.</p><p>As in all things, YMMV; these are just my thoughts.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/11/2001 11:31:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, we will see different things in this.  For me &quot;Incident at Drake&apos;s Bay&quot;<br/>is a concept work, like John Cage&apos;s &quot;4 Minutes and 33 Seconds.&quot;  Since first<br/>noticing this non-piece in piece&apos;s clothing, it seemed to me that Partch is<br/>describing an improvisation in a verbose, yet witty manner.  It may have been<br/>a reaction against something, but it was written (and dated) November 11,<br/>1953.

Instead, you extract only this<br/>jotting, free from any context whatsoever.</p><p>This, of course, allows it to conform to your own view that it is a<br/>piece, in and of itself. If anyone has spent time, virtually any time<br/>at all, trying to follow Partch&apos;s creative intentions, &quot;conceptual&quot;<br/>compositions, where the performers are allowed to do just whatever<br/>they please, aren&apos;t even on the map. That you would compare to Cage,<br/>having found this resource in a book that later shows in great detail<br/>the difficult correspondence that occurred between Partch and Cage,<br/>and contains some scathing reviews of Cage&apos;s general and<br/>compositional aesthetic, well... balderdash.</p><p>That&apos;s just my take on it, of course.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/11/2001 12:40:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon, I honestly do not have any other material other than what I posted.  I<br/>know all about Partch&apos;s negative views on Cage.  I also know Cage&apos;s positive<br/>views on Partch.<br/>The world has always put them on the same page, regardless.</p><p>Honestly, Jon, could your provide some background to this and &quot;Mendota<br/>Night,&quot; another example of Partch describing what appears to be an improvised<br/>&quot;piece.&quot;  Other examples of Partch using improvisation include &quot;Ulysses<br/>Departs From the Edge&quot; for trumpet (and string bass and boobams), and &quot;U.S.<br/>Highball for what is an improvised longer than usual measure.</p><p>I am well aware that Partch had doubts about things, including improvisation.<br/> He had doubts about being represented on vinyl, and yet he produced an early<br/>Indie.  BTW, Partch specifically states that &quot;Incident at Drake&apos;s Bay&quot; is &quot;a<br/>music drama&quot; right at the top.  In this regard it is superior to a mere<br/>abstract conceptualization, IMHO (and as honestly as I know how).</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>3/11/2001 1:32:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Jon, I honestly do not have any other material other than what I<br/>posted.</p><p>OK.

Yes, I know that<br/>Partch treated Cage as a charlatan.  However, steadfastly, Cage honored<br/>Partch and credited him.  When asked if Partch could indeed hear the notes he<br/>wanted to use, Cage gave out an emphatic &quot;Of course!&quot;  He was angry at the<br/>question, indignant (Mitch Corber&apos;s Cage Video).</p><p>Cage composed differently, like some of the people on this list.  Partch did<br/>not respect Cage, but Cage was tolerant to Partch, but not to Glen<br/>Branca....but that is a different story.  What I am alluding to is that both<br/>Partch and Cage were really different.  It&apos;s probably like Brahms and<br/>Tchaikovsky, 2 great talents interpreting their worlds differently.</p><p>According to Baker&apos;s Dictionary, Partch preceded Cage&apos;s 4&apos;33&quot; by a full year.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
