It&apos;s tough<br/>standing for three hours straight when I have a plate<br/>in my leg telling me to sit down. The show was f*@#$%&amp; amazing.<br/>It was great to hear my teenage guitar hero kick booty.</p><p>One of his stylistic qualities that I always liked - besides<br/>his unpredictability as an improvisor - was his senitivity to<br/>pitch. A few notes and I know it&apos;s him. He obviously<br/>a microtonalist, although I don&apos;t think a he&apos;s a modern day<br/>hot rod flash guitar Pythagoras.</p><p>Here&apos;s a quote from a CNN interview:</p><p>&gt; Q: How has your playing style changed over the years?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Beck: I think my playing has changed more in the last eight to<br/>&gt; 10 years than the rest of my whole life. Still, I cannot escape<br/>&gt; some Beckisms. I think Beckisms are influences from eastern<br/>&gt; Europe, speedy vibratos, slightly weird intonations. Influences<br/>&gt; from Bulgarian folk music have definitely crept in the last five to<br/>&gt; 10 years. I&apos;ve been in love with Bulgarian village choirs a long<br/>&gt; time. They&apos;re so spot on. The music sounds like 12-part<br/>&gt; harmonies. That has crept into my playing style.</p><p>Full interview here:</p><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9903/19/jeff.beck.ap/">http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9903/19/jeff.beck.ap/</a></p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=1928 href="#1928">ðŸ”—</a>Neil Haverstick &#x3C;stick@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/1999 8:22:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Beck is my first real guitar mentor...when I heard the Yardbirds as<br/>a kid, my whole life changed, thanks to Beck and co. His new CD is out,<br/>and very good...a couple of tracks are the best work he&apos;s ever done...I<br/>wish him much success. As far as his microtonal influences, the<br/>Bulgarian Choral music he mentions is surely in there...in fact, there&apos;s<br/>some singing by Angelite on the album &quot;Fly, Fly my Sadness&quot; that is<br/>eerily like the Yardbird&apos;s tune &quot;Hot House of Omagarashid,&quot; on &quot;Over<br/>Under Sideways Down.&quot; But, on Beck&apos;s new CD, I also hear influences of<br/>the Vietnamese instrument the Dan Bau, which is a one string zither,that<br/>can do some flabbergasting things. Beck did a CD called &quot;Frankie&apos;s<br/>House&quot; a while back, which was about the Vietnamese war; the music on<br/>this project was heavily influenced by the Dan Bau, and on &quot;Who Else&quot;<br/>(the new one). you can really hear this influence as well..there&apos;s some<br/>truly amazing guitar work on this disc, and it is way outside of the 12<br/>eq system. He does it strictly by feel and intuition, and it&apos;s some of<br/>the best rock guitar playing in many years...Hstick</p></div>
