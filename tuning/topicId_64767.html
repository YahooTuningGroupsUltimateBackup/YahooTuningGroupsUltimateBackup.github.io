I was around a lot a couple years ago.  I had a long<br/>thread asserting that barbershop harmony could exist in a pure<br/>extended JI with no tempering.  I have since learned a lot, played a<br/>lot of tempered music in a band setting, and am back to barbershop<br/>again.</p><p>While I do renounce my JI extremist fundamentalism, I stand by my<br/>statements about the flexibility and musical practicality of strict<br/>extended JI.  The difference is I now appreciate and respect all<br/>tunings for what they are and do not care to insist that strict JI<br/>is &quot;the way.&quot;  But is certainly is A way.</p><p>Announcing a recording I wish to share with the list.  Visit this<br/>address:</p><p><a href="http://www.harmonize.com/motorcity/bachelors/members.html">www.harmonize.com/motorcity/bachelors/members.html</a></p><p>There I have posted a number of recordings designed to help my<br/>barbershop chorus learn a song &quot;Bye Bye Blues.&quot;  After getting a<br/>recording of an unrehearsed quartet attempting the song, I used<br/>modern pitch adjusting software and a lot of work analyzing the score<br/>considering every tuning issue, this is the result.  Every single<br/>note is STRICT extended JI accurate to 1 cent, except for minor,<br/>intentionally left-in slides and extremely subtle vibrato (meaning I<br/>nearly squashed any recorded vibrato).</p><p>This is very listeneable.  But do keep in mind this is designed as an<br/>educational recording.  I think that a quartet that learned from this<br/>as strictly as humanly possible, that then added more dynamics and<br/>rehearsed better vocal technique and expressiveness would then be<br/>wonderful and truly appropriate for mass consumption.  This recording<br/>is not that.</p><p>These recordings show that in this style with a good arrangement,<br/>there is NO concern for the sliminess of comma shift and drift.  The<br/>melody line (Lead) even has a couple spots of exact note to note<br/>comma shift, but it is musically functional and expressive and<br/>subtle - almost beautiful and better than straight.</p><p>The basic idea was to stick with prime7-limit extended JI.  I had<br/>these priorities: when one part had a held or repeated note, but the<br/>overall harmony changed, I kept the one note the same and had the<br/>other parts tune to that.  Whenever shifting away from tonic into a<br/>circle-of-fifths progression, I had the root shift to sharper<br/>pythagorean notes and everything tune accordingly.</p><p>There were some tough decisions.  I feel very good about all the end<br/>results.  I used a septimal minor seventh chord with 7:4 and 7:6<br/>harmonies instead of a 5-limit m7 chord, because that fit better with<br/>the surrounding notes and harmonies, for example.</p><p>Sometime, I could post more details, or if there are any questions,<br/>let me know.  The notes that I posted list some of the spots.  The<br/>score is also available to download and look at, unfortunately not my<br/>copy that has my analysis on it.</p><p>I feel that this is proof that all that is needed to avoid<br/>the &quot;sliminess&quot; and weirdness of comma shift is appropriate and clear<br/>harmonic intent, just enough glide between pitches, and a good<br/>arrangement like this that puts the most distant harmonics in the<br/>harmony voices, keeping the bass and melody relatively consistent,<br/>and in this case focusing on pythagorean root motion, with almost<br/>entirely 9-limit harmonies.</p><p>When I have more time, I&apos;d love to share specifics about the chords<br/>used.  For now, let me know what you think.

It&apos;s very good, and really quite different although also<br/>strict JI.  Barbershop is traditional tonality and the Toby Twining is all over the place.<br/>There&apos;s a few dozen barbershop recordings about the quality of the Chrysalid Requiem,<br/>just not as unique and extensive.  My understanding is the singers listened to some tonal<br/>notes to follow but not to exact recordings of their parts.</p><p>Fact is, as much as I love that CD, barbershop (especially as I&apos;m presenting) shows far<br/>more how JI and microtonality relates to what most people understand as tonal music,<br/>with traditional framework and normal melodies.  In fact, I heard an instrumental jazz trio<br/>play a version of this particular tune just last weekend.</p><p>Anyway, I mostly want to point out that there are thousands of arrangements like the Bye<br/>Bye Blues one I&apos;m sharing.  While the Chrysalid Requiem is a unique one-time composition,<br/>barbershop is a style that we can discuss as a whole style, along with discussing ragas and<br/>blues and things like that.  In other words, just be sure not to think of this in any way as<br/>one special piece.  There&apos;s whole libraries of music like this, just not quite so carefully<br/>analyzed and recorded.  I did this one in a week (and an otherwise busy one at that).  I<br/>could easily do more.

I was around a lot a couple years ago.  I had a long<br/>&gt; thread asserting that barbershop harmony could exist in a pure<br/>&gt; extended JI with no tempering.  I have since learned a lot, played a<br/>&gt; lot of tempered music in a band setting, and am back to barbershop<br/>&gt; again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While I do renounce my JI extremist fundamentalism, I stand by my<br/>&gt; statements about the flexibility and musical practicality of strict<br/>&gt; extended JI.  The difference is I now appreciate and respect all<br/>&gt; tunings for what they are and do not care to insist that strict JI<br/>&gt; is &quot;the way.&quot;  But is certainly is A way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Announcing a recording I wish to share with the list.  Visit this<br/>&gt; address:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.harmonize.com/motorcity/bachelors/members.html">www.harmonize.com/motorcity/bachelors/members.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There I have posted a number of recordings designed to help my<br/>&gt; barbershop chorus learn a song &quot;Bye Bye Blues.&quot;  After getting a<br/>&gt; recording of an unrehearsed quartet attempting the song, I used<br/>&gt; modern pitch adjusting software and a lot of work analyzing the score<br/>&gt; considering every tuning issue, this is the result.  Every single<br/>&gt; note is STRICT extended JI accurate to 1 cent, except for minor,<br/>&gt; intentionally left-in slides and extremely subtle vibrato (meaning I<br/>&gt; nearly squashed any recorded vibrato).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is very listeneable.  But do keep in mind this is designed as an<br/>&gt; educational recording.  I think that a quartet that learned from this<br/>&gt; as strictly as humanly possible, that then added more dynamics and<br/>&gt; rehearsed better vocal technique and expressiveness would then be<br/>&gt; wonderful and truly appropriate for mass consumption.  This recording<br/>&gt; is not that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These recordings show that in this style with a good arrangement,<br/>&gt; there is NO concern for the sliminess of comma shift and drift.  The<br/>&gt; melody line (Lead) even has a couple spots of exact note to note<br/>&gt; comma shift, but it is musically functional and expressive and<br/>&gt; subtle - almost beautiful and better than straight.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The basic idea was to stick with prime7-limit extended JI.  I had<br/>&gt; these priorities: when one part had a held or repeated note, but the<br/>&gt; overall harmony changed, I kept the one note the same and had the<br/>&gt; other parts tune to that.  Whenever shifting away from tonic into a<br/>&gt; circle-of-fifths progression, I had the root shift to sharper<br/>&gt; pythagorean notes and everything tune accordingly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There were some tough decisions.  I feel very good about all the end<br/>&gt; results.  I used a septimal minor seventh chord with 7:4 and 7:6<br/>&gt; harmonies instead of a 5-limit m7 chord, because that fit better with<br/>&gt; the surrounding notes and harmonies, for example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sometime, I could post more details, or if there are any questions,<br/>&gt; let me know.  The notes that I posted list some of the spots.  The<br/>&gt; score is also available to download and look at, unfortunately not my<br/>&gt; copy that has my analysis on it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I feel that this is proof that all that is needed to avoid<br/>&gt; the &quot;sliminess&quot; and weirdness of comma shift is appropriate and clear<br/>&gt; harmonic intent, just enough glide between pitches, and a good<br/>&gt; arrangement like this that puts the most distant harmonics in the<br/>&gt; harmony voices, keeping the bass and melody relatively consistent,<br/>&gt; and in this case focusing on pythagorean root motion, with almost<br/>&gt; entirely 9-limit harmonies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I have more time, I&apos;d love to share specifics about the chords<br/>&gt; used.  For now, let me know what you think.

JI is not the reason this sounds unnatural.  The reason<br/>is due entirely to how much I had to adjust from a very unrehearsed performance by non-<br/>professionals.  Actual barbershop quartets do have chords that are nearly this close to JI,<br/>except that slightly more wavering of the voice is going to happen live, and that, of<br/>course, nearly no quartet is this flawless.  In other words, I doubt I&apos;ll find any top-level<br/>barbershopper who thinks that there is anything at all unusual sounding about my<br/>recording.  To a top level barbershopper, this JI recording simply sounds computer<br/>perfect, but it doesn&apos;t sound to a barbershopper&apos;s ears that any of the notes are different<br/>from normal.</p><p>So while I can&apos;t make claims about this recording sounding totally natural, I&apos;ll be so bold as<br/>to say that the idea that JI is to blame for any bit of unnaturalness is completely<br/>unfounded.  I have practically NO doubt that these JI notes are the ones any good<br/>rehearsed barbershop aims for and hears, even though their voices can&apos;t create computer<br/>perfect performances.  The only reason this is hard to show is that there are only a small<br/>number of quartets of world-class caliber, and most quartets are hobbyists who literally<br/>regularly sing wrong notes and do not sound anything like what they aspire to.</p><p>I know it may be hard to accept, but only people outside the barbershop world think that<br/>my recording is new sounding or weird or different.  Barbershoppers just think it sounds<br/>&quot;right.&quot;  And to my ears, this exercise showed me that the JI theories in my head DO in fact<br/>align exactly with the intuitive sense of barbershop harmony that I&apos;ve learned by rote.  Not<br/>a single note in my recording made me sit up and say &quot;oh, that&apos;s neat and different.&quot;  It<br/>sounds exactly like I&apos;m used to this song sounding, just more precisely clean and perfect.<br/>And with the same response from other barbershoppers, I know I&apos;m not just fooling<br/>myself.</p><p>Sorry if I come off as defensive, but I really feel this recording proves that you can&apos;t come<br/>up with a more accurate tuning system for this style.  JI is the right one, and the farther<br/>you drift from this, the less accurate to the style it will become.</p><p>-Aaron</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Really nice work.

But I still assert that you have no basis to claim JI as the unnatural factor.<br/>From what I hear, it is the precision of the notes, not the JI-ness that is unnatural.</p><p>At any rate, I agree that only by comparing other options would we be able to tell for sure.</p><p>I do not have a lot of experience with 99TET or 72.  I&apos;d be more than willing to open up my<br/>file and try some other tunings, and share the results.  I could use some guidelines as to<br/>how to go about this and what other options to try.  If you wanted to do something such<br/>as take a section of the score and simply tell me what cents offset to use for each note<br/>(meaning you do the analysis) then I&apos;ll go and create that version for you.  I&apos;m willing to do<br/>something even if you can&apos;t do that much work, but I will at least need some guidelines as<br/>to how to apply the tunings that you&apos;re suggesting.  Thanks.</p><p>I will state further though, that to my ears, many barbershop recordings DO sound like the<br/>chords in mine.  I have no problem admitting that it&apos;s *possible* 99TET will be better, but I<br/>have no reason to think so.</p><p>I can easily accept that the difference between my JI recording and live recordings is<br/>comparable to a computer quantized rhythm recording, and a love performance.  In other<br/>words, it is the imprecision and imperfection itself that draws the line between my<br/>recording and other barbershop, and that (while I&apos;m willing to try and see for sure) I think<br/>anything like 99TET could only sound more like standard barbershop because it would be<br/>slightly more dissonant.</p><p>To further the rhythm comparison, some &quot;grooves&quot; are as they are because a beat is<br/>clearly early or late or accented, such as can be created by modern groove quantization in<br/>today&apos;s sequencers.  This is different from imprecision, which is simulated by &quot;humanizers&quot;<br/>that randomize the timing and emphasis within a rhythm.  I think live barbershop exhibits<br/>this randomization, but is otherwise centered on JI.</p><p>I can add that I know for certain that even gold medal quartets have out of tune chords<br/>that go by in an instant, such that if we analyze those chords, they would be not JI, but<br/>that these same quartets, if they chose to hold them out, would adjust their tuning to<br/>make it near JI.  In other words, the tendancy is to skip through chords that don&apos;t sound<br/>just very quickly and focus on the functional chords.  Besides, the issue is a chicken and<br/>egg discussion.  Singing by ear with no arrangement came first in this style, but now we<br/>have written arrangements...  from what I&apos;m aware of, most woodshedding by ear<br/>harmonizers actual do not sing arrangements that have any of the major tuning problem<br/>areas that piano playing arrangers of written scores create.  They don&apos;t sound right, so<br/>they find ways to make it work.  It is temperament and pianos that leads to arrangements<br/>with these problems, and then quartets sing them and rush through the trouble spots.</p><p>Anyway, to wrap up, the point is:  even gold medal quartets will not claim that they are<br/>absolutely certain on their tuning.  It is tough stuff.  Again, I doubt I could find a<br/>barbershopper who thinks my JI chords sound different from the barbershop they are used<br/>to.  The only comments are and will be that it sounds robotic because it is so exact and<br/>because of the artifacts from the tuning adjustment.</p><p>In addition to trying some tempered versions of this, I hope to eventually make a JI<br/>recording along these lines that is based on a much more rehearsed, top level quartet<br/>recording, and I&apos;ll predict that you&apos;ll agree that one, in JI, will sound natural.</p><p>-Aaron</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Wolf&quot; &lt;backfromthesilo@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Gene,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sorry but I must strongly disagree.

Barbershoppers are<br/>clearly aiming to get the JI lock.  But they are real people with real voices and it is<br/>extremely hard.  As in my rhythm example, some band might truly feel like the bass is<br/>behind the bass drum in time, but let&apos;s say, for example that a band truly was attempting<br/>to create a singular sound of everyone hitting at one moment.  Then say you compare a<br/>live recording of that to a quantized, perfect recording.  They will not be the same.  Yet it<br/>will be erroneous to say that therefore the quantized version is different from the real<br/>style.  It is more the &quot;real&quot; style than the real people.</p><p>See I think it is all about INTENT.  Musical intent.  I think barbershoppers intend to lock<br/>chords, JI style.  And I don&apos;t think it is fair to say that since they don&apos;t always lock, that the<br/>lock is different from barbershop style.  The vast majority of my recordings of barbershop<br/>barely lock at all, but the vast majority of my fellow barbershoppers think that those vast<br/>majority of recordings are mediocre, so does that mean that anything not mediocre is not<br/>barbershop???  If a barbershopper says that the JI one sounds more &quot;right&quot; than the non-<br/>locked one, doesn&apos;t that say something?  I mean, when the Gas House Gang showed up,<br/>they were more in tune than any before them.  Did everyone say, &quot;that&apos;s not barbershop&quot;<br/>or &quot;that&apos;s different?&quot;  No, they said, &quot;wow, these guys are better than any quartet I&apos;ve heard<br/>before!&quot;</p><p>And if I start making JI part tapes and barbershoppers learn to sing from them, will that<br/>change the barbershop style into a different version?  I really don&apos;t think so.  I think it<br/>would be a simple case of getting better.  Just like someone who never practices with a<br/>metronome, all of a sudden learning to play with a metronome.  They can still perform<br/>without a click in their ear, but they&apos;ll be much better than before, and they can slow down<br/>and speed up when they INTEND to because their sense of timing is better.  Just like a<br/>quartet who might learn from my JI recording, might still sharp a note hear or there for<br/>expressive intent, because barbershop is still fluid, even though centered around JI.  Isn&apos;t<br/>that fair?</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=64894 href="#64894">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2006 9:19:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene:</p><p>Here&apos;s the list of the JI notes used the arrangement just for intro and chorus I, since I see<br/>no reason to spend time redoing the whole darn piece.</p><p>Intro in Eb:</p><p>63/32<br/>15/8<br/>1134/640<br/>27/16<br/>5/3<br/>25/16 *used just in end slidy chord, so could be otherwise, but use this<br/>3/2<br/>189/128<br/>45/32<br/>1701/1280<br/>21/16<br/>81/64<br/>5/4<br/>9/8<br/>567/512<br/>35/32 *used just in end slidy chord, so could be otherwise, but use this<br/>135/128<br/>1/1</p><p>Chorus I in Ab:</p><p>63/32<br/>15/8<br/>9/5<br/>27/16<br/>5/3<br/>8/5<br/>3/2<br/>189/128<br/>45/32<br/>7/5<br/>4/3<br/>21/16<br/>81/64<br/>5/4<br/>6/5<br/>153/128<br/>7/6<br/>9/8<br/>135/128<br/>1/1</p><p>If you could give me cents info, that&apos;d be ideal.

It&apos;s a tad more fatigueing to my ears.<br/>There&apos;s no way that it sounds closer to &quot;right.&quot;  But in a way, it sounds more<br/>similar to barbershop recordings that, yes, are not perfectly JI.</p><p>So you know what?  All this leads me to be totally uninterested in exploring more<br/>temperaments.  I&apos;ll simply say that there&apos;s a continuum from JI to way off dissonant<br/>that has no clear dividing lines, it&apos;s totally continuous.  Remember, by the way, that<br/>even the original JI posting did not have completely no vibrato, so it wasn&apos;t absolutely<br/>perfect, and on top of that, it was only accurate to 1 cent at the best.</p><p>The difference between JI and 72 is enough for me to have a clear preference, but<br/>I wouldn&apos;t care much if I were just a casual listener.</p><p>As I said originally, I&apos;ve renounced my fundamentalism.  Temperament is ok.<br/>It&apos;s all a question of tolerances and where to put one&apos;s time while working on<br/>music.  So here&apos;s where I&apos;ll stand:</p><p>The nature of this style is harmonizing by matching overtones.  That implies JI,<br/>but there are tolerances for all sorts of variations.  As that is the case, some<br/>quartets focus more than others on subtleties of tuning, or on lessening vibrato.<br/>There really is enough range that we can&apos;t honestly break apart all the elements<br/>from a complete performance.  There is still no doubt in my mind that no quartet out<br/>there would be in a position to hear the difference between JI and subtle temperament<br/>and care about the difference and choose the temperament as preferred.  In other<br/>words, most any quartet would barely care about this level of subtlety.  What you&apos;d<br/>never find, I predict, is one that did, yet preferred temperament.</p><p>What my recording still shows is that comma shift is NOT a problem, and that the<br/>essential feel of barbershop is based on raising by a comma when leaving tonic<br/>and then heading around the circle of fifths back home.  And this is very different<br/>from the ideas I&apos;ve seen that claim that barbershop has a near equal tempered melody<br/>and then near JI chords around it.  It&apos;s quite clear to me that nearly every lead singer<br/>is also tuning subtley to the chords around them, and that as often as not the bass<br/>part is the most stable, as it is nearly always on roots and fifths.  And basses learn to<br/>sing most notes a comma high, such as in Pythagorean, because they only sing 3 based<br/>harmonies.  There&apos;s no 5s or 7s in the bass part almost ever.  So of course the bass<br/>would be used to pythagorean intervals, that&apos;s all they ever sing, and all exceptions<br/>are treated as the bass singer on a non-bass note.</p><p>To summarize: barbershop tuning is basses on pythagorean intervals when the<br/>harmony changes, and everyone else tuning to that and basically matching harmonics,<br/>which implies JI, even though the result will be tempered by varying degrees for various<br/>reasons.  Comma shifts are fine and happen.</p><p>To conclude finally, there is a large range of what will be accepted as barbershop.<br/>Most importantly in my mind, the &quot;problems&quot; of JI that most people cite are not<br/>problems.  Therefore, it is wholly reasonable for me to say that I&apos;d like my quartet<br/>and chorus to aim for JI, and that doing so is entirely within the barbershop<br/>tradition, even if it is not always the way things are done.  And there are no<br/>cons to be wary of when taking this JI approach.</p><p>A final note, every theorist within the barbershop society has the underlying<br/>idea that JI is the goal we all have, so I&apos;m not imposing some new idea on something<br/>that was previously done differently.</p><p>Love to hear any feedback.

Kind of wish you&apos;d tested something other than 72, though. :)<br/>&gt;</p><p>I only stopped there because it convinced me of the value of being slightly off fromJI.<br/>Really, it did.  I don&apos;t think that it is any of these particular temperaments, but<br/>simply being tempered that creates the effect.  And it has its place for sure.</p><p>If I intended this for mass consumption, I&apos;m quite certain that what would deliver the<br/>best result would be to use JI as a foundation, and then have a live quartet sing<br/>it well.  Then, I could even move pitches around if I chose, but I wouldn&apos;t squash the<br/>vibrato so much.  I think simply having less squashed vibrato will have the same<br/>effect as the tempering.  Besides that, if I felt that expressively it would be nice<br/>to move some notes away from JI, I&apos;ll do that.</p><p>I mainly think JI is still the foundation to which everything else is off by.</p><p>Just like a late beat in a groove has the effect of being late because the strict<br/>beat pattern is the simple foundation.  And late beats can be wonderful, no<br/>doubt!  Just like temperament can be.</p><p>To put it another way, there is no need for &quot;compromise&quot; in barbershop that<br/>results in tempering.  It can simply be off from JI because that effect may be<br/>musically desired (or not, it&apos;s up to the musicians making the music).</p><p>So understanding that, I have no need to try other temperaments.  I know what<br/>I need to know.  That JI works and that slight tempering doesn&apos;t destroy the sound<br/>and less than 72TET tempering would be subtler and I bet I&apos;d like it.</p><p>If I ever create a barbershop recording for mass consumption that I don&apos;t feel<br/>is innapropriate to have retuning done, I will consider all these options and how<br/>they fit my expressive goal.  So it may or may not be JI or may fluxuate.  But JI<br/>will always be the starting point for undertanding the harmonic content.</p><p>Thanks for helping me see the big picture.</p><p>I think I can build from here to create truly flexible recordings that are less<br/>stagnant and have more life.  Again, the important stuff is that I&apos;ve learned that<br/>JI really can work, so I can disregard the warnings against it, and consider tuning<br/>only on the basis of desired musical effect, and I&apos;ll be open to the possibilities in<br/>that regard.</p><p>And while I think anyone could accept the comma shift in my JI recording, I think<br/>that they&apos;d be even less blatant with subtle, natural vibrato and less aliasing, and<br/>I could even use more sliding to hide the shift, so there&apos;s no way it could ever be<br/>a distraction and problem musically.</p><p>The one other bit of knowledge is that I don&apos;t have to accept any comma DRIFT.<br/>I can have it if I want it, but I&apos;ve shown that it can be cleanly avoided without<br/>any compromise to any harmonies.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=64955 href="#64955">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2006 12:50:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Here&apos;s the intro in 72ET:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.darktownsaints.com/intro72.mp3">www.darktownsaints.com/intro72.mp3</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Honestly, it doesn&apos;t sound THAT different.

While<br/>there was conflict, we are on good terms.  We all have different priorities.  Drew, the<br/>keyboard player is the driving force behind being commercial, and I&apos;m glad to have learned<br/>what I did from that focus, but it isn&apos;t my priority (although I do care to be accessible).  I&apos;m<br/>working on developing new microtonal music, and I&apos;ve got some LONG term projects that I<br/>think everyone here will find exciting, but there unfortunately won&apos;t be any results for<br/>quite some time.
