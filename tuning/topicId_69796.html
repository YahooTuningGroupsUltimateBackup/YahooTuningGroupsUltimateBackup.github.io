From this you can see, if you read these things, that the<br/>generator is an 8/7 and the period an octave.</p><p>It&apos;s been pointed out that Studloco contains the entire 11-limit<br/>tonality diamond with the exception of 11/10 and 20/11, which falls<br/>between -19 and +19 secors. Studloco we can take as between -20 and +20<br/>secors, and it has three copies of this truncated tonality diamond in<br/>it. Studloco has about the same number of notes as the Partch Genesis<br/>scale, and people have had fun compariing the two.</p><p>I want to point out here that Rodan[41] is remarkably similar to<br/>Studloco, and in some ways better. Rodan[41] also has everything in the<br/>11-limit diamond with the exception of 11/10 and 20/11 between -19 and<br/>+19 generators, and we similarly have three copies of this truncated<br/>diamond between -20 and +20 generators. The tuning accuracies are<br/>comparable--a good rodan tuning being 128-et. But rodan is a much<br/>better 13-limit temperament than miracle, and has many 13-limit<br/>intervals, in better tune than 72-et allows, inside of the compass of<br/>Rodan[41].</p><p>The complexity of 3/2 in rodan is 3 rather than 6, of 7/4 is 1 rather<br/>than 2, and of 7/6 is 4 rather than 8. 11/8 has a complexity of 13 as<br/>opposed to miracle&apos;s 15. Rodan is high-complexity for 5/4: 17 as<br/>opposed to 7. But the tuning world is overrun with people who seem to<br/>get along fine without much 5 in their music, and certainly you still<br/>get plenty of it in Rodan[41]. The complexity of 13/8 is 22 in rodan,<br/>which is pretty high, but better than the secor complexity of 34 (or<br/>38, in the other direction) it has in 72-et. Rodan really does much<br/>better at working the 13-limit into the picture.</p><p>Here&apos;s Rodan[41] in 128-et:</p><p>! rodan41.scl<br/>Rodan[41] in 128-et tuning<br/>41<br/>!<br/>28.125<br/>56.250<br/>84.375<br/>112.500<br/>150.000<br/>178.125<br/>206.250<br/>234.375<br/>262.500<br/>290.625<br/>318.750<br/>346.875<br/>384.375<br/>412.500<br/>440.625<br/>468.750<br/>496.875<br/>525.000<br/>553.125<br/>581.250<br/>618.750<br/>646.875<br/>675.000<br/>703.125<br/>731.250<br/>759.375<br/>787.500<br/>815.625<br/>853.125<br/>881.250<br/>909.375<br/>937.500<br/>965.625<br/>993.750<br/>1021.875<br/>1050.000<br/>1087.500<br/>1115.625<br/>1143.750<br/>1171.875<br/>1200.000</p></div>
