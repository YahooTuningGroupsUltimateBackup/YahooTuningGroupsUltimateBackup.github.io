Each passage<br/>to a<br/>&gt; &gt; new mode produces the lowering of a note so that, at the end,<br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt; will have lowered any note except the tonic. If you do the same<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt; this last note you will reach again a lydian mode but an half<br/>tone<br/>&gt; &gt; below.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Considering the structure of these modes you will find that<br/>there<br/>&gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; a specularity in the structure between lydian and locrian,<br/>ionian<br/>&gt; &gt; and phrigian, mixolidian and eolian; and that dorian mode is<br/>&gt; &gt; specular respect himself.</p><p>Well, this &quot;specularity&quot; is the first discovery many of us have come to<br/>(including myself). But when you start inverting actual music, soon you get<br/>to another important result. The tonic is no longer tonic because the only<br/>degree that has still the same meaning is the third. The inversion makes the<br/>tonic exchange the position with the dominant. So if you invert the ionian<br/>mode, in fact, you get the hypoaeolian rather than phrigian. As an example I<br/>could take a scale of C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C which is ionian. If I want to leave<br/>the C unchanged, after inverting I get C-Bb-Ab-G-F-Eb-Db-C. Right, let&apos;s try<br/>it with the major chord of C-E-G-C. Inverting this makes C-Ab-F-C, or<br/>upwards, C-F-Ab-C. You see, it looks like phrigian but the centre is on F,<br/>not on C, and that&apos;s just why I think that calling it &quot;hypoaeolian&quot; would be<br/>rather in place here. This can be also explained well in the terms of just<br/>intonation. Suppose you make a dorian mode on D so that the basic three<br/>triads (d-minor, G-major, a-minor) are in tune. Just for clarity I will list<br/>the scale here for you:<br/>9/8<br/>6/5<br/>4/3<br/>3/2<br/>5/3<br/>9/5<br/>2/1<br/>OK, let&apos;s invert this in the way of &quot;2/factor&quot;. And what do we get?<br/>10/9<br/>6/5<br/>4/3<br/>3/2<br/>5/3<br/>16/9<br/>2/1<br/>What a strange result? So both C and E are a syntonic comma lower now and<br/>the rest is unchanged. In this scale, the a-minor chord is out of tune. On<br/>the other hand, the C-major chord, which was unusable in the previous scale,<br/>is now maximally in tune. Does it mean we got a mixolydian mode? Yes, we<br/>almost did. More precisely, we turned a dorian into a hypomixolydian.<br/>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=53871 href="#53871">ðŸ”—</a>frizzerius &#x3C;lorenzo.frizzera@libero.it&#x3E;</h3><span>7/2/2004 6:15:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ciao Petr.</p><p>&gt; Well, this &quot;specularity&quot; is the first discovery many of us have<br/>come to<br/>&gt; (including myself).

So has to be expected that, in just<br/>intonation, there is a shift of tonal center of a descending fifth<br/>(or an ascending fourth).</p><p>I think that this specularity is not interesting as a source for JI<br/>tunings but to understand that there is a descending stability in<br/>modes when you order in fifths. To me (these was the argument) the<br/>minor triad is the next step respect major triad in this descending<br/>stability scale. The next one is the diminished triad.<br/>I was trying to show that a minor triad comes from a specularity<br/>model which also produces a &quot;flattening&quot; process. This also confirm<br/>that feeling regarding major triad as more rooted or the locrian<br/>scale as less rooted. Infact during this process each mode change a<br/>note (inserting a flat) and this note is the root respect the tonic<br/>of the mode. So the mode looses gradually his &quot;tonicity&quot;.<br/>I think that the minor mode (I consider the official minor as<br/>dorian) comes from this process.</p><p>Ciao</p><p>Lorenzo</p></div>
