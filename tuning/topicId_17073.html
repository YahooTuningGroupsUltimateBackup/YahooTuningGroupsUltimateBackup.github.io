I&apos;m very sorry that my absurd flight delays<br/>got me there too late to meet Heinz Bohlen, who was prepared for<br/>my visit on Saturday; it would have been the three of us together.<br/>But on Sunday, Kees took me on a very nice, albeit very short<br/>(and very foggy) sight-seeing trip.  (I missed the beautiful<br/>weather in SF on Saturday...)</p><p>Kees also drove me to the airport and came in with me, where we<br/>got to see a very interesting exhibit of percussion instruments<br/>from all over the world, from the collection of Mickey Hart<br/>(or is that Nicky?), who used to play drums for the Grateful Dead.<br/>It was very strange that just that morning in my hotel room in<br/>San Francisco, on the &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; TV program, I had<br/>seen a segment specifically about that percussion exhibit.<br/>I recognized some of the instruments from TV when we actually<br/>saw them at the airport.</p><p>It turns out that Kees and I have many interests in common...<br/>such things as lattice diagrams, Schoenberg, maps, etc.  There&apos;s<br/>a rumor that we may be collaborating on a Schoenbergian project<br/>some time in the future...<br/>(hint: a film realization of _Die Glu:ckliche Hand_...)</p><p>...

Do you not feel that this kind of<br/>modification to other&apos;s compositions (whether public domain or not),<br/>represents a kind of &quot;distortion&quot; of the original intent of the<br/>composer?</p><p>One other thing too is this: If Schoenberg&apos;s intention was to attempt<br/>to avoid &quot;tonality&quot; within the pitch set of 12tET, then is it your<br/>intention to give Schoeny a tuning that would help him along the way,<br/>such as 13tET? Or is it your intention to re-tune his (or other&apos;s)<br/>music to an unintended &quot;tonal&quot; system, such as JI? It could be<br/>perceived by many, that to impose something onto another&apos;s work,<br/>which was not their intention could represent a kind of &quot;trampling of<br/>the sacred&quot;.</p><p>Let me pose by analogy: What if you composed a piece of music in &quot;X-<br/>Tuning&quot;, that you felt delivered the desired intention of the music,<br/>and less than a hundred years from now, some future microtonalist(s)<br/>came along and found your tuning theory to be ludicrous, and decided<br/>to make &quot;improvements&quot; to your work, by imposing their own subjective<br/>tuning views onto your compositions? How would you (or your ghost)<br/>view this kind of &quot;hi-jacking&quot;?  When you compose new music, are you<br/>intending that others may be allowed to come along in the future and<br/>make alterations to the original intent of your music?</p><p>Let me know if this is ok. When you guys have left for the big<br/>microtone in the sky, I&apos;ve got some great ideas I&apos;d like to try out<br/>on your midi files - of course - I&apos;m unable to discuss these with<br/>the &quot;living&quot; victims at this time (although I have been wondering how<br/>Joe Monzo&apos;s work would sound with a &quot;house beat&quot;, and tuned to a 8000<br/>tone non-octave scale).   }:  )</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/2001 11:24:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(Sorry to have taken so long to respond to this request...<br/>Upon resettling back home, I&apos;m working a lot of hours and<br/>also dealing with a rather severe personal crisis...)</p><p>Jacky Ligon<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17093">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17093</a></p><p>raises the question of the ethics of retuning the music of<br/>composers who had a definite intended tuning for their pieces,<br/>specifically, the case of Schoenberg.</p><p>John deLaubenfels<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17104">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17104</a></p><p>answers that he sees all music as fair game for retuning,<br/>provided that the altered version is clearly labelled as<br/>such and is not marketed as representing the composer&apos;s<br/>intention, and that any living composer should be paid for<br/>any work so used.</p><p>Bob Valentine<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17121">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17121</a></p><p>says pretty much the same, arguing from the jazz musician&apos;s<br/>perspective that a &quot;tune&quot; is little more than a melody and<br/>chord changes, around which good jazz musicians will improvise<br/>a piece that may sound nothing like the original tune.</p><p>Jacky answers Bob:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17126">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17126</a></p><p>&gt; All your points are well taken and well put, but perhaps I<br/>&gt; neglected to make it clear that I was questioning the<br/>&gt; re-tuning of Schoenberg&apos;s music in particular.  And as we<br/>&gt; know, his music (latter opus&apos;) dealt with the unique<br/>&gt; theoretical/philosophical approach of trying to avoid<br/>&gt; tonality with his serial techniques, using the 12tET pitch<br/>&gt; set.  This concept was anchored in this tuning system.  So<br/>&gt; with this in mind, I find it extremely difficult to be overly<br/>&gt; euphemistic with regard to imposing a tuning other than 12tET<br/>&gt; onto Big Daddy Schoenberg.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Follow me in this line of reasoning for a moment, by<br/>&gt; considering 2 things:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.  If one attempts to impose a JI quality onto this music,<br/>&gt; where its intention is to avoid the feeling of tonality,<br/>&gt; then &quot;distortion&quot; IMHO spells more accurately what&apos;s being<br/>&gt; done to Schoenberg&apos;s music.  The &quot;Lense&quot; analogy again!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2.  If one wishes to &quot;help him along the way&quot; with a tuning<br/>&gt; system that would have surely been more beneficial to this<br/>&gt; already bizarre theory, then 13tET would be the perfect choice<br/>&gt; as far as avoidance of tonality (or perhaps an non-octave<br/>&gt; spiral tuning).  But then, one is confronted with the fact<br/>&gt; that Schoenberg&apos;s music used highly specialized 12tET set<br/>&gt; theory, with the 12 tone row, and also to impose this onto<br/>&gt; his music (forgive me Bob!), would also amount to &quot;distortion&quot;<br/>&gt; of the geometries of his theory.  This however would be the<br/>&gt; approach I would be most interested to hear - if Schoenberg<br/>&gt; wanted to avoid tonality, then supply his music with a tuning<br/>&gt; system with maximal tonal ambiguity, and PLEASE let me know<br/>&gt; when you&apos;ve got the midi file ready!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just to clarify:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have absolutely no issues with &apos;interpretation&apos; or<br/>&gt; &apos;realisation&apos; or &apos;rendering. I also have been an active<br/>&gt; improvising musician for most of my music life, so all<br/>&gt; you said was in resonance with me, but when we speak of<br/>&gt; re-tuning music which is inseparable from its tuning theory/<br/>&gt; set theory, then we tread a thin line between &quot;distortion&quot;<br/>&gt; and the more euphemistic choices of &apos;interpretation&apos; or<br/>&gt; &apos;realization&apos; or &apos;rendering.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.S. This was really an attempt to get Monz to speak about<br/>&gt; how he intends to tune this music.</p><p>I agree very much with what both John and Bob said.</p><p>Please note emphatically that the compositions of Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>in which I&apos;m most interested, and those which I&apos;d like to retune,<br/>are *not* the later 12-tone serial pieces, but rather, the early<br/>tonal and &quot;free atonality&quot; ones.</p><p>Schoenberg did indeed consider the question of using microtonal<br/>tunings, experimented with quartertones a bit around the summer<br/>of 1909, and rejected them by August 1909.  (I&apos;ll be presenting<br/>this info, along with much more concerning Webern and many German<br/>and Austrian microtonalists of the early 1900s, in a lecture/<br/>demonstration at Microfest 2001 in Claremont, CA, in April.)</p><p>So far, John has let his software do the work of retuning<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s early masterpiece _Verkla:rte Nacht_, and I&apos;m *very*<br/>pleased with the results, agreeing with John that the 7-limit<br/>version sounds best.  In disagreement with John, I also very<br/>much like the 11-/13-limit version and think that it sounds<br/>not too much unlike what real string players might play.</p><p>It&apos;s difficult for me to give a real answer as to how I&apos;d retune<br/>this early Schoenberg work.  I feel like there&apos;s still so much<br/>research to be done.  Schoenberg had a brilliant mind, which more<br/>often than not was able to embrace two opposing poles of thought,<br/>probably because he was able to see that they were merely the ends<br/>of a continuum of possibility... very much like the way he described<br/>the issue of consonance and dissonance (see my &quot;sonance&quot; Dictionary<br/>entry).  His rhapsodizing about the beauties of &quot;untempered&quot; music<br/>while at the same time rigidly limiting himself to the 12-tET scale<br/>are only one more example of this, and one which makes it extremely<br/>difficult to divine exactly what he may have been &quot;hearing in his<br/>head&quot; when he wrote these pieces.  And ultimately, what I&apos;m trying<br/>to do is to give a presentation of the music which I think comes<br/>as close as possible to what these composers heard in their heads.</p><p>One thing which would be good to bear in mind is that after 1904<br/>Schoenberg idolized Mahler, and accepted wholeheartedly many of<br/>Mahler&apos;s idiosyncratic performance practices.  Mahler was roundly<br/>criticized (by the newspapers) for his reorchestration of Beethoven&apos;s<br/>9th, but Schoenberg entered all of Mahler&apos;s changes into his own<br/>copy of that score.  My point: Mahler had absolutely *no* qualms<br/>about rewriting an older piece, and his intention was always to<br/>&quot;bring out the composer&apos;s intention&quot;.  Usually, his changes were<br/>based on things such as the increased size of the orchestra and<br/>concert hall of his day compared with, say, Mozart or Beethoven&apos;s.<br/>He realized that the different &quot;room&quot; in which the music was played<br/>had a tremendous impact on the audience&apos;s reception, and tried<br/>to adjust accordingly.</p><p>And again exemplifying the paradoxes inherent in Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>thinking, he discussed in his _Harmonielehre_ [1911] how the<br/>overtone series makes a good archtypical pattern which helps<br/>guide the composer into using &quot;new&quot; harmonic structures, then<br/>later (in a much-quoted letter to Joseph Yasser) insisted that<br/>good musicians did not let their technique be dictated by<br/>&quot;natural&quot; (= JI) tendencies, but rather learned how to alter<br/>these tendencies to conform to &quot;humanistic&quot; (= 12-tET) art.</p><p>The only real arguments Schoenberg cited in abandoning<br/>microtones were:  1) the inavailability of instruments so<br/>tuned, and 2) his inability to comprehend the math.  If it<br/>weren&apos;t for those two limitations, he apparently would have<br/>accepted microtonal tunings for use in his own work.</p><p>Joe Pehrson:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17133">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17133</a></p><p>&gt; I&apos;m sorry, Jacky, but I believe this reading is a totally<br/>&gt; inaccurate assessment of Schoenberg&apos;s intention. I will<br/>&gt; need Joe Monzo, an expert in these matters, to back me up,<br/>&gt; but in NO WAY was Schoenberg hoping to &quot;destroy tonality.&quot;<br/>&gt; I think you need to read up a bit on your history (despite<br/>&gt; your great ability in sound manipulation, which I greatly<br/>&gt; admire!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg considered himself a continuation of the great<br/>&gt; Germanic tradition from Mozart and Brahms onward, and his<br/>&gt; 12-tone system was rooted in the idea the EVERY SINGLE TONE<br/>&gt; was a tonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, Schoenberg didn&apos;t want his system to be called<br/>&gt; &quot;atonality&quot; or &quot;serialism.&quot; He thought of it as a way of<br/>&gt; extending tonality post-Wagner.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe the term he wanted was &quot;pan-tonality,&quot; right Monz??</p><p>Right, Joe, Schoenberg preferred &quot;pantonality&quot; to describe what<br/>he did between 1908 and roughly 1920 (when he began composing<br/>serially), and which is today known as &quot;free atonality&quot;.  Schoenberg<br/>very logically argued (as he always did) that since the very<br/>substance of music was &quot;tone&quot;, then &quot;atonal&quot; was an oxymoron<br/>and could not describe anything having to do with music.  His<br/>point here was that the overtone series presented an extended<br/>set of harmonic relationships which could be emulated and explored<br/>in compositions, and that until his day composers had stopped<br/>at 5-limit but he wanted to go beyond.</p><p>Schoenberg&apos;s big apparent error, as pointed out by Partch, was<br/>the inconsistency (in the Erlichian sense) of his mapping of<br/>13-limit ratios to the 12-tET scale.  I say &quot;apparent&quot; because<br/>Schoenberg had absolute pitch and certainly would have known,<br/>had he heard them, that the 7th, 11th and 13th harmonics were<br/>*far* off from their supposed 12-tET representatives.  But most<br/>likely, he never did hear them, and his argument would thus<br/>be based entirely on theoretical considerations.  He admitted to<br/>being less than conversant in the mathematics of tuning, so<br/>he probably never did realize how inaccurate his ideas were.</p><p>And note, in passing, that Jacky did not accuse Schoenberg of<br/>wanting to &quot;destroy tonality&quot;, but only of wanting to &quot;avoid&quot; it.<br/>I&apos;m not exactly supporting Jacky&apos;s interpretation, because at<br/>least in his &quot;pantonal&quot; music, what Schoenberg clearly wanted to<br/>do was to *expand* tonality.  I suppose tho that &quot;avoid&quot; is a<br/>good way to characterize what he was doing after the adoption<br/>of the &quot;12-tone method&quot;; it&apos;s consistent with the language in<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s later essays.  There was clearly a major change<br/>in his thoughts about harmony during the relatively barren<br/>(in terms of compositions) period around World War 1.  IMO,<br/>his biggest concern was that he needed some type of systematic<br/>limitation on his compositional possibilities after he chucked<br/>old-fashioned tonality, and serialism was it.</p><p>What I&apos;m interested in exploring is: how might Schoenberg have<br/>actually used the overtone series as the paradigm for his set<br/>of limitations if he had continued to experiment with microtones?</p><p>Jacky:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17137">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17137</a></p><p>&gt; Your [John deLaubenfels&apos;s] work stands as a pinnacle of<br/>&gt; excellence to me in the area of midi files/tuning, but I<br/>&gt; do not see it as the same thing as re-tuning Schoenberg.<br/>&gt; This becomes a much deeper philosophical undertaking</p><p>What must be kept very clear is that Schoenberg had a very open<br/>mind about intonation until around 1912 or so.  This was when<br/>he first contacted Hauer (the other, earlier, inventor of a<br/>12-tone method) and began formulating his serial method.<br/>Also note that Schoenberg never became proficient at the piano<br/>or any other fixed-tuning instrument; he was and always remained<br/>a fretless-string player (mainly violin and cello), which I<br/>think certainly influenced the way he thought about tuning.<br/>So while I agree with Jacky that Schoenberg&apos;s wishes for his<br/>serial music should be respected, I think there are a multitude<br/>of tuning possibilities for his earlier pieces without piano<br/>(much of this was for string ensemble or orchestra).</p><p>Note that right around the time that Schoenberg rejected microtones<br/>was also when he invented _sprechstimme_.  This was a vocal technique<br/>which he continued to incorporate in many of his compositions for<br/>the rest of his life; the earliest example is &quot;Klaus the Fool&apos;s<br/>Narrative&quot; from the _Gurrielieder_ [1910] and the last (that I<br/>know of) is _A Survivor from Warsaw_ [1947].  It&apos;s very interesting<br/>to me that while he abandoned the use of microtones on *instruments*,<br/>he preserved them on voices.</p><p>The points made by Christopher Bailey<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17150">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17150</a></p><p>about the way Schoenberg may have wished to mix various different<br/>implied tunings are also relevant.  By knowing that 12-tET distorted<br/>the true harmonic intervals and accepting it anyway, he knew that<br/>his 12-tET chords were not accurate reflections of the harmonic-series<br/>structures he purported to be using as his basis.  I think he very<br/>much was thinking in terms of letting nature be his guide but<br/>reshaping what he found there into &quot;artistically acceptable&quot;<br/>(i.e., 12-tET) terms.  He was also very much interested in exploiting<br/>the ambiguities involved in the tempered approximations to the<br/>JI ratios.</p><p>(Thanks for asking, Jacky... it&apos;s helped me put together a lot of<br/>my upcoming lecture!
