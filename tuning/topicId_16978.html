I *do* know<br/>that if you are buying a card for a studio, you should make<br/>sure it is full duplex, or you will not be able to double<br/>track recorded music, as opposed to MIDI. Also, depending on<br/>how you are going to get your MIDI sounds, whether<br/>triggering an external synth or using the sounds resident on<br/>your card, it may be important to get a card with good<br/>native sounds. I have been using a Creative PCI 512<br/>recently, and for under $100, it serves my needs. I am sure<br/>there are newer, better, cheaper cards out there these days.</p><p>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
