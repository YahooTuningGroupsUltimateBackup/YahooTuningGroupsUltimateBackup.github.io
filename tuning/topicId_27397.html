Your graphics are quite beautiful. It<br/>sounds like you have a ton of interesting ideas, and from the end of<br/>the &quot;atlas&quot; page, it sounds like you&apos;re interested in adaptive JI,<br/>which our own John deLaubenfels has perfected (give him a MIDI file<br/>and he&apos;ll give you an adaptive JI retuning of it).</p><p>I do have quite a number of comments and questions. Here&apos;s the first.<br/>Aristoxenos is known as the staunch _opponent_ of JI in the ancient<br/>Greek world. While most theorists from Pythagoras to Ptolemy, and<br/>even (as if by force of habit) Kirnberger, were fond of supplying<br/>lists of ratios for their scales, Aristoxenos maintained that these<br/>ratios had nothing to do with music; that the ear must be the final<br/>arbiter of correctness in interval; and that the usual modes implied<br/>a division of the octave into 12 conceptually/perceptually equal<br/>parts, with other scales implying a 72-tone octave.</p><p>I&apos;ll continue with further comments at your request.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p></div>
