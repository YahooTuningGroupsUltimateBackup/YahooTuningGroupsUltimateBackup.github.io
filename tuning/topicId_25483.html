The logarithmic division of the 2:1 is different<br/>&gt;for all three tunings, and not many of the degrees really<br/>&gt;match up.</p><p>Clearly they don&apos;t have many pitches &quot;in common&quot;, but I never made that<br/>claim! (Obviously, ET&apos;s will only have pitches in common if they have<br/>common factors, in this case 2.)</p><p>To clarify what I intended: if two EDO&apos;s (say x-TET and y-TET) both have<br/>good approximations of some interval, then the scale produced by adding<br/>together the number of steps per octave in both tunings (x+y-TET) will have<br/>an approximation that&apos;s somewhere in between. It might be better than both,<br/>or it might only be not quite as bad as the least good approximation.</p><p>What&apos;s happening with 56-TET is that 34-TET&apos;s minor seventh (988.2c) isn&apos;t<br/>a very good ~7/4 (968.8c), but 22-TET&apos;s is better (981.8c). Thus, 56-TET&apos;s<br/>minor seventh has got to be better than 34-TET&apos;s, but since both 22-TET and<br/>34-TET have sharp minor sevenths (if intended as a ~7/4 approximation),<br/>56-TET&apos;s approximation to ~7/4 isn&apos;t as good as 22-TET&apos;s. It happens to be<br/>985.71 cents, but you don&apos;t need to do the calculation to know that it&apos;s<br/>going to be somewhere in between the 22-TET and 34-TET values.</p><p>This seems like magic, but it makes sense if you look at a permutation<br/>lattice. I first saw this at <a href="http://www.bikexprt.com/tunings/tunings3.htm">http://www.bikexprt.com/tunings/tunings3.htm</a>,<br/>but I&apos;d been making charts that looked similar to that before I saw it<br/>online. There&apos;s a similar chart somewhere in the Erv Wilson archive. Note<br/>that 56 fits between 22 and 34* on the diagram, and there are straight<br/>lines connecting all three scales. Why this works is probably a topic for<br/>the tuning-math list (and I don&apos;t fully understand it myself), but the fact<br/>that it *does* work is useful in characterizing EDO&apos;s for their musical<br/>properties. All meantone ET&apos;s, for instance, are various sums of 12 and 7<br/>(12+7=19, 19+7=26, 19+12=31, 31+12=43, 31+19=50, etc.)</p><p>*actually, 34-TET is shown as 17-TET in the chart, but you can imagine<br/>where the missing lines would be, or print out the chart and fill them in.</p><p>(In fact, both 34-TET and 56-TET have better ~7/4&apos;s, but they don&apos;t show up<br/>in the retuning, since the 12-TET original doesn&apos;t distinguish between ~7/4<br/>and ~16/9. Since the errors for the ~7/4 are opposite in 22-TET and 34-TET,<br/>56-TET actually has a better ~7/4 than either of them.)</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=25500 href="#25500">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/23/2001 10:43:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: Herman Miller &lt;<a href="mailto:hmiller@IO.COM">hmiller@IO.COM</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Saturday, June 23, 2001 2:39 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [tuning] 22 + 34 =/= 56 (was: Re: Warped Canon page updated!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To clarify what I intended: if two EDO&apos;s (say x-TET and y-TET) both have<br/>&gt; good approximations of some interval, then the scale produced by adding<br/>&gt; together the number of steps per octave in both tunings (x+y-TET) will<br/>have<br/>&gt; an approximation that&apos;s somewhere in between.
