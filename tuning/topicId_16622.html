Monz did mention, though,<br/>&gt;that this exercise is particularly applicable to Verklarte Nacht<br/>&gt;since, of course, the original instrumentation is unfretted strings!</p><p>I have been quite surprised, since first supporting sequences with<br/>multiple voices, how forgiving instruments other than the piano are to<br/>retuning!  The piano is a crisp, stark instrument, yet the differences<br/>still seem to go beyond what I would expect.  David Finnamore&apos;s<br/>suggestion may be correct, that our ears are already accustomed to<br/>strings, winds, and horns having a somewhat variable pitch, while the<br/>piano is expected to hold a constant tuning.  Still, I&apos;m not sure I<br/>understand the whole picture.</p><p>Thanks again for your comments, Joe!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
