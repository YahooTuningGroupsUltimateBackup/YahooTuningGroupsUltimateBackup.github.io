It&apos;s actually pretty neat that the difference tone changes so clearly when I move the C by 57/56. I can&apos;t get it to generate an F at all though, no matter how I try to cheat. I&apos;m not sure what these guys were thinking, because if every harmonic is a multiple of 3 then it&apos;s simply a harmonic series on C and has nothing to do with F. There is no &quot;period tripling&quot; that would be needed to produce F.</p><p>If there&apos;s no distortion I can&apos;t hear any of these things, only imagine them.</p><p>The two base notes for the minor triad are of course very clear with modest distortion, but again pretty much absent without it.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=105553 href="#105553">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/2012 10:21:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Dec 12, 2012 at 12:39 PM, bigAndrewM &lt;bigandrewm@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;In this process, the auditory system tolerates quite large mistunings<br/>&gt; between partials and fundamentals.

I think that exposure<br/>to these sorts of sounds can carry over later to situations when<br/>there&apos;s no VF at all, such as in an arpeggiated chord - you still<br/>remember the sound lurking in the background that you know would be<br/>there if you just played all of the notes at once. To a lesser extent<br/>I think the same applies to things like dyads, where save for stuff<br/>like 3/2, I find that unless my level of consciousness is somewhere up<br/>there with &quot;Buddhist monk,&quot; I don&apos;t really hear any overt VF at all.</p><p>This is just my experience though, YMMV. But FWIW, I find that some<br/>principle like the above models very well how my hearing has changed<br/>as I&apos;ve played more in 19-EDO and 22-EDO. 9/7 used to sound woefully<br/>discordant to me, but once I started playing 4:7:9 and 9-limit harmony<br/>in general a lot, it started sounding more like an abstract &quot;piece&quot; of<br/>that chord. The same applies to 11/8; it still has that same sort of<br/>semi-discordant flavor to it, but it&apos;s hard for me to play that dyad<br/>and not immediately think of a full 8:9:10:11:12 lurking somewhere in<br/>the vicinity after playing around in porcupine temperament so much,<br/>and this covers up the discordance somewhat.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
