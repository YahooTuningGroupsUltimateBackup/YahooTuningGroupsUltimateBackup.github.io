Perhaps Gerry can<br/>&gt;reference some vocal music (his or others) where the &quot;high third&quot; in a<br/>&gt;major triad that he is referencing here is making itself particularly<br/>&gt;apparent? Without this it seems hard to imagine this thread really<br/>&gt;going anywhere (other than where it seems to be presently stalled at<br/>&gt;that is).</p><p>That fact is becoming more and more apparent to me. I was hoping to find<br/>that others on the list, like John LInk, had experienced the triad with the<br/>&quot;mysterious&quot; third. It appears that most of the good folks here have been<br/>approaching tuning from a different point of view (no problem) and therefore<br/>should not be expected to have experienced the tuning we singers &quot;know&quot; to<br/>be &quot;natural.&quot;</p><p>I am on the road at the moment so cannot access any &quot;illustrations&quot; but will<br/>do so as soon as I get home. You are absolutely right that this discussion<br/>will go nowhere until some specific sounds are introduced to the<br/>conversation.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
