Commissioned<br/>by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, &apos;The Dharma at Big Sur&apos; is the first<br/>piece to receive its premiere at the new hall.</p><p>&lt; just intonation, six-string violin &gt;<br/>Fittingly, Adams has composed a groundbreaking score.  The orchestra<br/>performs in just intonation, a system of tuning in which the<br/>intervals can be expressed as whole-number ratios.  The sound of a<br/>justly-tuned ensemble - previously explored by composers such as Lou<br/>Harrison and Harry Partch, among many others - has an unmistakably<br/>pure and resonant quality.  The two-movement work also includes a<br/>prominent role for six-string electric violin, played by Tracy<br/>Silverman.  (Tuned in 5ths like a standard violin, the bottom two<br/>strings go down to F above the cello&apos;s low C, and are<br/>fretted.)</p><p>&lt; a tribute to his adopted home state &gt;<br/>After graduating from Harvard in 1971, Adams drove to San Francisco.<br/>He was well aware of others who had preceded him, including fellow<br/>Massachusetts native Jack Kerouac, whose books include &apos;On the<br/>Road,&apos; &apos;The Dharma Bums,&apos; and &apos;Big Sur.&apos;  Says Adams, &quot;I wanted to<br/>write something that had as its theme the sensation that one<br/>experiences on arriving in California. I looked around for literary<br/>sources, and eventually hit on Jack Kerouac.  His arrival here was<br/>sort of a defining moment - not only for himself but for the<br/>representation of a totemic experience for all Americans, which is the<br/>journey westward.&quot;</p><p>&lt; his first glimpse of the Pacific &gt;<br/>Ultimately, Adams hopes to convey the exhilaration of a life-changing<br/>encounter.  &quot;I&apos;ll never forget the first time I came down the Marin<br/>headlands on a beautiful August morning, and saw the Golden Gate<br/>Bridge and San Francisco off in the distance - those were very<br/>powerful moments....I hope to create a musical expression of that<br/>experience.&quot;</p><p>__________________<br/>Steven Swartz<br/>Publicity Manager<br/>Boosey &amp; Hawkes, Inc.<br/>35 East 21st Street<br/>New York, NY 10010<br/>212/358-5361 tel<br/>212/358-5306 fax<br/><a href="http://www.boosey.com">www.boosey.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=48002 href="#48002">ðŸ”—</a>Maximiliano G.
