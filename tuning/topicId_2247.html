From: Sarn Richard Ursell &lt;<a href="mailto:thcdelta@pop.ihug.co.nz">thcdelta@pop.ihug.co.nz</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I noticed that there is a lot of talk these days on the tuning list about<br/>&gt; the use of prime numbers.<br/>&gt; In some ways these are very special, but it really depends on which way you<br/>&gt; look at things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My point may be entirely philosophical, but: &quot;What is so special about logic?&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I mean, playing around with my formula graphing programme, and ants, and<br/>&gt; cellular automata in QBASIC, I notice how counter intuitively logic behaves,<br/>&gt; at times.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I mean, is it just THERE, waiting to be discovered, or do we invent it?<br/>&gt; Or both?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does the mind create mathematics, or mathematics create the mind?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, we could say, &quot;BOTH&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But it brings us to the question of &quot;Which came first, the chicken or the egg?&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My post may seem a little esoteric, but, I wanted to ask you microtonalists<br/>&gt; about you philosophys on, why we are here,what lies beyond the big brick<br/>&gt; wall saying &quot;do not enter&quot; at the Universe&apos;s boundrys, the so-called<br/>&gt; existance of time, the mind to body connection.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a theory of &quot;the Polyverse&quot;-something who&apos;s existance I have argued<br/>&gt; about to a rather abrasive mathematician at Victoria University in<br/>&gt; Wellington, (New Zealand&apos;s capital city).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe, and have believed, even since my childhood-as I became aware of<br/>&gt; being, and not just accepting, as a child does, that our Universe, is one of<br/>&gt; many others, in an infinite continum called &quot;the Polyverse&quot;-an infinite<br/>&gt; array of Universes each with their own laws of science.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And whilst these places (if we can use the term &quot;places&quot;-perhaps &quot;realms&quot;,<br/>&gt; or &quot;planes&quot; is a better word), would be very beautiful, they would contain<br/>&gt; little in the way of intelligent life, to ask:&quot;Why are we here&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess that this could be compared to games in a toystore:<br/>&gt; Cards, Monopoly, Chess, Dominos, &quot;Hungry-hungry hippos&quot; (my favorite), Guess<br/>&gt; Who?, Treyshar Chess (3 player Chess), Jenga ect.....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I incorrectly labeled this form of thinking &quot;The Strong Anthroptic<br/>&gt; Principal&quot;-after reading this in Stephen Hawking&apos;s &quot;A Breif History of Time&quot;.<br/>&gt; Was this an editorial error?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---I looked up the definition on the Internet, and found it completely<br/>&gt; different!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In some way, these Universes are competeing for existance, and ours is<br/>&gt; somewhere at the top of the chain, or near to it.<br/>&gt; Ours, also, in some ways, reflects these other Universes, but the Polyverses<br/>&gt; interacting parts are seperate from each other, and cannot interact-I believe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This also brings us to the question of &quot;hyper-exobiology&quot;, or &quot;Its life,<br/>&gt; Jim-but not as we know it&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Life from another universe, with, say 5 spatial dimension, and two time<br/>&gt; dimensions, would be??????<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also believe that other Universes could have different, and even<br/>&gt; logically-inconsistent mathematics, where our algebraic rules, at least,<br/>&gt; break down.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have come to believe, also, that matter is infinitely divisible, split an<br/>&gt; electron, we get a &quot;cosmolon&quot;, split a quark and we get a &quot;preon&quot;,<br/>&gt; ------&gt;the infintesimal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cartoon Universes, laughing at our logically constricted constraints on<br/>&gt; their cartoon television sets, even these are logicaly constricted to<br/>&gt; Universes with different mathematics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was reading about a class of numbers called:surreal numbers, and<br/>&gt; transfinite numbers, as invented (or discovered by Gregor Cantor).<br/>&gt; Aleph_0= 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..........<br/>&gt; Aleph_1=Irrationals, cannot be shown as a fraction=1.3412743784747.......<br/>&gt; Aleph_2=fromulae involving rationals and irrationals in Aleph_0 dimensional<br/>&gt; space....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does anybody know about anything higher than Aleph_2?<br/>&gt; Also, Aleph_Aleph_0 was = to Beth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And also, I found a class of numbers called &quot;Hyperinacessible&quot;, given by<br/>&gt; Aleph_Aleph_n, where n=&gt;0.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I need to know:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is there anything of use with:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.Canor&apos;s Alephs,<br/>&gt; 2.Hexagonal matrices,<br/>&gt; 3.Surreal-surreal numbers,<br/>&gt; 4.Superpowers/superinvolution?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. and 3.I have invented.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And this is why I have always loved microtonal music-as I feel that it gives<br/>&gt; us a chance to glimpse these other planes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I need to know is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IS THERE ANYONE ELES ON THE ALTERNATIVE TUNING LIST THAT SHARES THIS<br/>&gt; PHILOSOPHY WITH ME???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If so, I&apos;d love to hear from you,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;
