Admission to the public will be free. In exchange for the free<br/>admission we are receiving a large amount of TV, radio, press, and internet<br/>advertizement in the central Indiana area.  In order to raise money we will<br/>be asking for donations and selling** CDs.</p><p>We are asking our community for submissions of high quality microtonal<br/>music or microtonal books to be sold at the recital. All proceeds will go<br/>to Untwelve - all recognition from the sale will go to the composers /<br/>authors who contributed. While submissions of physical media would be<br/>totally awesome you can also submit mp3 / wav / flac / PDFs and we will<br/>package them into CD-Rs with light-scribe labels for sale at the event. We<br/>will put a link in the CD-R package to a webpage that will point to<br/>explanatory text or if you prefer a link to your web presence. Due to<br/>practical considerations submission doesn&apos;t guarantee use of your material<br/>though we will consider every work submitted and may use it, with your<br/>permission, at a future event. Also, you must *explicitly* give Un12 the<br/>right to use your submission for fundraisers.</p><p>We are also actively pursuing additional dates for Dr. Kallay in Urbana,<br/>Chicago, and Boston.</p><p>Some links to Aron Kally&apos;s work follows:</p><p><a href="http://www.aronkallay.com/index.html">http://www.aronkallay.com/index.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMlzIwFr2M0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMlzIwFr2M0</a><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlFmJEQzGPI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlFmJEQzGPI</a><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT4ChF1cWrc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT4ChF1cWrc</a><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdJkIsbobjQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdJkIsbobjQ</a></p></div>
