I need to simplify things and keep my e-mail volume as low as possible; I&apos;m not always good at keeping up with things.</p><p>Also, I uploaded a few showoff tracks to my music page (<a href="http://dannywier.ucoz.com/index/music/0-2?lr2Y7v">http://dannywier.ucoz.com/index/music/0-2?lr2Y7v</a>): &quot;An American in Istanbul&quot;, &quot;The Devil Sleeps Tonight&quot; (so far unfinished), and a new version of &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; using the GeneralUser soundfont. I also added descriptions of the tunes, and everything in the &quot;symphony/soundtrack&quot; uses pitches fron 72-edo, though much of the time it&apos;s conventional 12-tone.</p><p>And I may have gotten &quot;discovered&quot;: I met someone here in Austin who works with composers in Hollywood for TV programs and ads, movie trailers, video games and other software. He liked my work and is recommending me to his friends--it&apos;s still way too early to know where this will lead, but it&apos;s an opportunity. I told him I&apos;d write jingles for minimum wage, essentially.</p><p>Finally, an observation: I&apos;ve long complained that 440 Hz as a tuning standard was a bit, you know, arbitrary, but it occurred to me recently: if A is 440 Hz, then B half-flat could be 440 &times; 12/11 = 480 (12/11 ~ 150.64 cents, close enough to 24n-equal), E half-flat is 480 &div; 3/2 = 320, and that&apos;s four octaves above 20 Hz, the nominal low end of the human hearing range. Also, an octave below that, 10 Hz, produces oscillations every 0.1 sec, the normal human response time. Of course, 320 Hz could be thought of as E comma-flat too, 5/4 higher than C = 256 Hz, but I&apos;d rather stick to the commonly accepted standard...</p><p>~D. &para;&brvbar;&not;{&gt;</p></div>
