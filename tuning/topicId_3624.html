In the 3, 5, 7 lattice it looks like this:</p><p>&#x9;     6/5 --- 3/2 ---15/8<br/>&#x9;     / \     / \     /<br/>&#x9;    /   \   /   \   /<br/>&#x9;   / 7/5 \ / 7/4 \ / 35/32<br/>&#x9; 8/5 --- 1/1 --- 5/3</p><p>&#x9;28/15</p><p>The pivotal pitch of the scale is pitch 28 out of 31, represented twice<br/>by 15/8 and 28/15 (separated by 225/224), this scale&apos;s equivalent of the<br/>supertonic in that it relates the &quot;dominant&quot; and &quot;subdominant&quot; harmonic<br/>regions to each other.

Frankly, my theorizing has never made it to this stage<br/>before.</p><p>Oh, John and Daniel--I know full well numerology is a bunch of hooey.<br/>My father is a mathematician, after all.  But in this case it&apos;s kind of<br/>fun to speculate on what subconscious or cultural influences may have<br/>been at work.  F&apos;rinstance, cats have nine lives and I love cats, and as<br/>I mentioned before nine is significant in Norse mythology, which I have<br/>been interested in for a long time.  Here&apos;s a quote from _The Norse<br/>Myths_, by Kevin Crossley-Holland:</p><p>&#x9;Nine worlds encompassed by the tree (which so becomes a symbol<br/>&#x9;of universality known to mythologists as the World Tree); nine<br/>&#x9;nights hanging on the tree; the number nine recurs again and<br/>&#x9;again in Norse mythology.  Odin learns nine magic songs from a<br/>&#x9;giant that enable him to win the mead of poetry for the gods;<br/>&#x9;Heimdall has nine mothers; Hermod, Odin&apos;s son, journeys for nine<br/>&#x9;nights in his attempt to win back the god Balder from Hel; the<br/>&#x9;great religious ceremonies at the temple of Uppsala lasted for<br/>&#x9;nine days in every ninth year, and required the sacrifice of<br/>&#x9;nine human beings and nine animals of every kind.  Why nine was<br/>&#x9;the most significant number in Norse mythology has not been<br/>&#x9;satisfactorily explained, but belief in the magical properties<br/>&#x9;of the number is not restricted to Scandinavia.  In _The Golden<br/>&#x9;Bough_, J.G. Frazer records ceremonies involving the number nine<br/>&#x9;in countries as widely separated as Wales, Lithuania, Siam and<br/>&#x9;the island of Nias in the Mentawai chain.  Nine is, of course,<br/>&#x9;the end of the series of single numbers, and this may be the<br/>&#x9;reason why it symbolises death and rebirth in a number of<br/>&#x9;mythologies; hence it also stands for the whole.</p><p>No luck yet on 31 though. 8-)&gt;</p><p>--pH &lt;<a href="mailto:manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu">manynote@lib-rary.wustl.edu</a>&gt; <a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote</a><br/>    O<br/>   /\        &quot;Churchill?

Sorry, when<br/>&gt; was it?</p><p>Last Thursday.  Basically, you fix 1/1, 5/4, and 8/5 as the boundaries<br/>of three tetrachords (pitches 1, 4, 7 of the nonatonic scale), then the<br/>others can vary within those bounds as long as they form a 8/7, 7/6, or<br/>6/5 with one of those pitches.  Nine tones is a little too few to have<br/>very many complete tetrads, but this technique practically guarantees<br/>you a reasonable number of triads.  So far the interesting ones I have<br/>are:</p><p>4-3-3-5-3-3-4-3-3</p><p>The most regular melodically.  Harmonically there are only two consonant<br/>tetrads, one Otonal and one Utonal, both most consonant with the 1/1 of<br/>the scale as the root.  For these reasons I think of it as being<br/>somewhat analogous to the major pentatonic (12TET 2-2-3-2-3).  Looking<br/>for interesting scales I generally start with this one and then start<br/>varying pitches by 36/35s and 49/48s.</p><p>4-4-2-5-3-3-4-3-3</p><p>The most regular harmonically, as it can be derived from three 4:6:7<br/>triads rooted on 1/1, 5/4, and 8/5.  Possibly the best nonatonic<br/>equivalent of the major diatonic scale.  Two Otonal tetrads on 1/1 and<br/>8/5.</p><p>3-5-2-5-3-3-4-3-3</p><p>The one with the most (7-limit) consonances.  Also it has three tetrads<br/>instead of two; the same two the above scale has, plus a Utonal one.<br/>Sort of analogous to Mixolydian.</p><p>3-4-3-5-3-3-4-3-3<br/>3-4-3-3-5-3-4-3-3<br/>3-5-2-3-5-3-4-3-3</p><p>Other variants with three tetrads, but the way they relate to each other<br/>harmonically is a little stranger.  Still figuring these out.</p><p>&gt;                                         I haven&apos;t spent much time looking<br/>&gt; for harmonic derivations as things like 3 triads without common tones or<br/>&gt; 3 tetrads with tend not to be very good scales melodically in my<br/>&gt; experience.</p><p>This is where Fokker&apos;s method really helps me out; it assures me of a<br/>relatively even distribution of pitches, as pairs of pitches separated<br/>by one of the &quot;vanishing&quot; intervals are disallowed.
