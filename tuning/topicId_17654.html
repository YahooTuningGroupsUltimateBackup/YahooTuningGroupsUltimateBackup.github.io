Good choices.<br/>&gt; Can be microtuned?</p><p>You could retune an SB Live by making your own SoundFonts with different<br/>pitch specifications, like with any sampler.  A few of us were looking at<br/>software to automate this, but nothing came of it.  I would still be<br/>interested in a simple program that could read in a SoundFont file, and<br/>spit it out in a different cent-step equal temperament, without the clever<br/>stuff about re-defining key ranges.  If somebody has a library for reading<br/>the files, get in touch.</p><p>The other work-around for soundcards is to retune them using pitch bends.<br/> I have some free software for doing this, see<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/software.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/software.htm</a>&gt;.  There&apos;s also the Fractal Tune<br/>Smithy that gets talked about here.  It&apos;s shareware, but it seems he<br/>doesn&apos;t mind people using it on indefinite evaluation.  Anyway, pitch bend<br/>tuning is good for casual use, but not for serious work.  So an Oasys card<br/>would be wasted if it doesn&apos;t have tuning tables.</p><p>The classic retunable sound card is the Turtle Beach Tropez Plus.  But<br/>this is really old now, and ISA only.  I don&apos;t know of any newer ones.<br/>Theoretically, any card should work with the right drivers.  So you could<br/>get hold of a Free Linux driver, become a C god, and re-write it to<br/>support tuning tables.  Unfortunately, it&apos;d still only work in Linux.</p><p>The next nearest thing to a retunable soundcard is Kyma, which is even<br/>more expensive than Oasys and doesn&apos;t do normal soundcard things.  But is<br/>very powerful.  Otherwise, use soft synths.  CSound and Reaktor are both<br/>being used by list subscribers.  VAZ+ claims to use tuning tables, but I<br/>haven&apos;t seen them.  And there&apos;s that sampler that I&apos;ve forgotten the name<br/>of.  You could try a search on the archive.</p><p>&gt; I there a list of sound cards with Microtuningd<br/>&gt; capabllity?</p><p>There&apos;s a list of synthesizers:</p><p>    &lt;<a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal/">http://home.att.net/~microtonal/</a>&gt;</p><p>It does include soundcards, but no recent ones last time I checked.</p><p>&gt; My extent of microtining will be on less than<br/>&gt; 12 tone scales.</p><p>You think that now!</p><p>                 Graham</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Vas</p></div><h3><a id=17783 href="#17783">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2001 8:04:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Graham Breed wrote:]<br/>&gt;Anyway, pitch bend tuning is good for casual use, but not for serious<br/>&gt;work.</p><p>Wah!!

Thanks for the info!</p><p>No, it only seems to be a couple of Turtle Beach cards that use it.<br/>From what I gathered on this list, there was an engineer at TB who was<br/>keen on tunings, got the standard through and got it implemented (in<br/>part).  But then he left, and TB dropped microtonality, and nobody has<br/>yet picked up the standard.</p><p>That&apos;s a good link, as it covers the low-level detail.  You can work<br/>it out, but here&apos;s some high-level guidance.</p><p>Bulk tuning dump request<br/>------------------------</p><p>Not very glamorous, but it means you can find out what tuning tables a<br/>synthesizer already has.  Target device ID is a standard SysEx thing,<br/>it defaults to the primary channel number for the device.  The tuning<br/>program number is so that the synthesizer can hold up to 128 tuning<br/>tables at any one time.</p><p>Bulk tuning dump<br/>----------------</p><p>This is the reply to the request, but also what you use to send a<br/>tuning table.  It contains a list of 128 frequencies mapped to notes,<br/>so this is a full keyboard dump.  Checksums are a pain if you&apos;re<br/>constructing messages manually, but there is one.  It does mean you<br/>can request a re-send if the dump fails.</p><p>Realtime messages<br/>-----------------</p><p>These are what you want!  You can arbitrarily retune any notes from<br/>any tables.  So it isn&apos;t limited to static tuning tables.  You could<br/>load a different table to each channel, and use one of these messages<br/>every time you want to change the pitch of a note.  12 note octave<br/>tables would probably be implemented with these messages.</p><p>No checksum, how nice.</p><p>Program and bank changes<br/>------------------------</p><p>These use RPNs.  RPNs are a way of getting beyond the limit of 128<br/>MIDI controllers.  The hex messages are telling you how to set an RPN.<br/>The standard controllers 00 and 03 are used to say which RPN you want<br/>to change.  The MSB is 00 in both cases, like all current RPNs (others<br/>are for setting the pitch bend range and absolute pitch).  The LSB is<br/>03 for a program change and 04 for a bank change.  Controller 6 is<br/>used to set the value.</p><p>The program change is so that you can say &quot;use this tuning table on<br/>this channel&quot;.  This is a good thing to be able to do.  I think the<br/>bank change is so that you can have more than 128 tuning tables<br/>available, like GS, SoundCanvas and XG have more than 128 patches.</p><p>Note that 3 and 4 are small numbers.  RPNs were only introduced by<br/>GeneralMIDI.  0, 1 and 2 are for pitch bend range, coarse and fine<br/>tuning.  These are part of GM, and I think they have to be implemented<br/>for a &quot;GM&quot; sticker to go on the box.  The MTS obviously doesn&apos;t have<br/>that status, but its RPNs were either assigned as part of GM, or were<br/>the first to be added afterwards.</p><p>Frequency data format<br/>---------------------</p><p>The &quot;frequencies&quot; are specified relative to an untuned note.  This is<br/>like saying &quot;D5 +37 cents&quot; except the offset is  in 16384 steps to a<br/>semitone instead of 100.  And you can only specify sharp, but that&apos;s<br/>no problem because flat is only sharp of the previous note.</p><p>The divisions are a way of doing binary fractions.  Nothing clever<br/>there.  Note that this means 1/163.84 cent precision.</p><p>It&apos;s a shame nobody uses this, because it&apos;s comprehensive enough that<br/>everybody could implement the part of it that their synthesizer<br/>supports.  And you could embed the SysEx messages instead of having to<br/>embed pitch bends, and be careful about the channel assignments.</p><p>Still, such is life.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17818 href="#17818">ðŸ”—</a>Vas Gardiakos &#x3C;vas@albrite.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2001 11:22:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Graham, Dimitri, John and all,</p><p>I certainly am learning a heck of a lot about<br/>microtuning!</p><p>All samplers can be microtuned!

You won&apos;t need to run a pitch shift algorithm.<br/> I think that&apos;s how GigaSampler works already.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; My polyphony requirement is high due to my style of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Music and the 294 two dimensional keyboard I am building.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Is there a reason why multitracking doesn&apos;t suit?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I will also employ multitracking but I need live<br/>&gt; high polyphony. My choices are limited<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just found out that Creamware PowerSampler can be staked two high<br/>&gt; for a total of 64 note stereo polyphony. Unfortunately<br/>&gt; it is not 128 note mono polyphony</p><p>If polyphony&apos;s all you want, a Korg X5D has 64 note polyphony.  As you<br/>can assign channel and note ranges, you could chain as many as you<br/>like.  And there is an equivalent rack unit that saves you the cost of<br/>the keyboard.  There must be a lot of other external hardware that&apos;ll<br/>do the same job.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Each of the six segments will have 49 white keys, 25 front<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And 24 back with no black Raised keys.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ooh!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So why not throw in more rows, and make it a Bosanquet keyboard?<br/>&gt; If<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;re building it from scratch, that is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is a Bosanquet keyboard!!!<br/>&gt; I want to check it out, however there is<br/>&gt; a budget, space and design criteria to<br/>&gt; consider.</p><p>The Bosanquet is a 19th century layout for a two dimensional keyboard.<br/> This link might help.</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.bikexprt.com/music/introduc.htm">http://www.bikexprt.com/music/introduc.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>And the Wilson Archive will have something</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html</a>&gt;</p><p>It looks like</p><p> C# D# E# Fx Gx Ax<br/>C  D  E F# G# A# B#<br/> Db Eb F  G  A  B<br/>     Fb Gb Ab Bb C<br/>                Cb</p><p>sort of thing.</p><p>&gt; the re-mapping can be done sometimes in a drum editor.<br/>&gt; Also Windows provides a midi mapper.
