As I see it, all kinds of creative deviations from the<br/>modern<br/>standard 24-tET can be justified on theoretical and/or cultural<br/>grounds, but<br/>I wouldn&apos;t automatically stuff everything into the nearest just ratios<br/>unless I were going to make a significant use of harmony (which is<br/>rare in<br/>Arabic music). If I were, I&apos;d make sure the ratios provided for simple<br/>proportions in the intervals to be used as harmonies (rather than<br/>worrying<br/>about whether they looked simple on their own), and didn&apos;t run into<br/>any<br/>comma difficulties (such as the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth between 9/8 and 5/3 if I<br/>planned to use the D-A harmony in the C major &quot;just&quot; scale).<br/>Otherwise, I&apos;d<br/>see no real reason to choose just ratios over 24-tET, though in many<br/>cases<br/>(11/9, 3/2, etc.), it wouldn&apos;t make an audible difference.&quot;</p><p>Paul,</p><p>I will keep your suggestions in mind as I work with the scales.</p><p>I entered all of the Arabic scales into my spread sheet so that I<br/>could see them as cents scales. I found that one of the scales had a<br/>sequence that exceeded 1200 cents. It was the 3 1 2 1 4 4 2 4 4 Maqam<br/>Jabburi, which added up to be 150, 200, 300, 350, 550, 750, 850,<br/>1050, 1250 cents. Is this correct for this scale? All the others<br/>terminated on 1200 cents.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky</p></div>
