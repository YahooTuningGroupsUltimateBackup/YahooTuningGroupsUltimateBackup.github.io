I particularly liked Thomas&apos; deconstruction of Eggar&apos;s<br/>arguments.</p><p>Anyway, re: the historical development of pianos, in particular the<br/>issue of inharmonicity. This is a topic I can speak to with some<br/>authority as it is my primary professional occupation.</p><p>Inharmonicty is caused by one thing: the relative rise in significance<br/>as a restoring force of the stiffness of the string over the<br/>normally-operative restoring force of tension. The added force of<br/>stiffness increases the acceleration of the displaced string during<br/>every cycle, and increased acceleration naturally results in decreased<br/>period which raises the frequency of that particular mode of<br/>vibration. It affects higher modes progressively more than lower.<br/>Inharmoncity is ALWAYS present in EVERY vibrating string, it is just<br/>that in many cases it is so low that the difference between the<br/>altered series of overtones and a truly harmonic series is<br/>inconsequential.</p><p>In practical terms, stiffness becomes noticeably operative due to<br/>three design factors:</p><p>1. Tension. When the ambient tension drops, rigidity becomes<br/>relatively more operative. This is why traditionally keyboard<br/>instruments have been designed to utilize maximum practical tension<br/>levels. I will state that I believe there is no real grounds for the<br/>current low tension fad which some harpsichord makers are peddling.</p><p>2. Length/diameter ratio. When diameter becomes larger relative to<br/>length, rigidity increases. Simple tube/beam models.</p><p>3. Stiffness of the material. Different metals have different values<br/>of Young&apos;s Modulus (E), and the higher the value, the more rigidity,<br/>thus the more inharmonicty, all other factors being equal (tension,<br/>length, diameter, freq.). The Great Divide is the move from<br/>charcoal-fired steel refining to coal-fired, which occurred near the<br/>end of the first half of the 19-century. Charcoal introduces trace<br/>amounts of phosphorous, which is the factor which makes the material a<br/>steel and not pure iron. This was the operative element from antiquity<br/>until 1840 or so. Coal, on the other hand, leaves trace amounts of<br/>carbon, which is the basis of modern steels. The two together produce<br/>an extremely brittle material which is useless as it cannot be formed,<br/>which is why modern steel production processes involves aspects to<br/>control any P contamination.</p><p>As of today, nobody has reproduced P wire in commercial quantities.<br/>Stephen Birkett in Canada is coming close, but the process is<br/>complicated and expensive. ALL other &quot;historical&quot; wires are made from<br/>carbon-based steels, even if the seller claims they are &quot;iron&quot;. Based<br/>on lab tests of surviving historical strings, P wire seems to have<br/>been surprisingly strong while having a value of E significantly lower<br/>the C steel. This makes it more flexible and also raises internal<br/>damping, both of which give a pure (i.e. more harmonic) though less<br/>bright tone.</p><p>Historically, the story was pretty simple. The first pianos more or<br/>less had string lengths similar to harpsichords, but it was quickly<br/>discovered that a thicker string works better when the excitation<br/>mechanism is a hammer. Thicker strings require a shorter scale, not<br/>for tension&apos;s sake, but because they will break at lower loads<br/>(tension/area). Contrary to what you will read in many books, it is<br/>not true that all diameters of a given material will break a the same<br/>pitch, a falsehood based on the fact that while tension varies, load<br/>is constant for all diameters at a given length/freq. Steel (and to a<br/>lesser extent, brass) work-hardens when cold formed, and wire drawing<br/>is a type of cold-forming. Thus finer diameters are relatively<br/>stronger than fatter, and when you replace a fine string with a<br/>thicker you will find that it cannot be drawn up to the same pitch<br/>before it breaks.</p><p>Thus the early makers where caught in a bind regarding inharmonicty:<br/>thicker strings required shorter scales, and inharmonicty rose because<br/>the were getting a double whammy on the diameter/length ratio: strings<br/>where becoming both shorter and thicker. From 1800 or so onward, the<br/>move to ever thicker strings was further encouraged by a desire for<br/>ever louder instruments, largely due to the gradual demise of the<br/>patronage of royalty and the emergence of a relatively wealthy middle<br/>class which desired to ape the life styles of the aristocrats in every<br/>possible way, which included the &quot;consumption&quot; of cultural events.<br/>Thus the appearance of the mega-concert, by which the artist earns by<br/>packing ever more people into ever larger halls.</p><p>The increased thickness matched by reduced scale length continued<br/>until the appearance of true carbon steel. By this time, makers had<br/>also been playing around with metal reinforcement, primarily as a<br/>means of stabilizing tuning under variations of temperature and<br/>humidty, to the point where the two separate developments coincided to<br/>allow a return to longer scales with even larger strings. The metal<br/>frameworks allowed the higher tension levels and the stringer wire<br/>allowed a longer scale, which - theoretically - inharmonicty. However,<br/>the increased stiffness of the stronger material added increased<br/>inharmonicity which could not be entirely accounted for by the<br/>increased length, which meant that makers have never been able to<br/>reproduce the relatively pure sound of an early piano in the larger<br/>modern form.</p><p>Modern steel is many many times stiffer than old wire. I have some of<br/>the stuff in my shop and I am always amazed t how utterly rigid it is<br/>compared to all the &quot;historical&quot; wire types I have, including some<br/>real antique strings. I have not measured the inharmoncity of a modern<br/>piano, though it would be plenty easy enough to do and perhaps I&apos;ll<br/>get around to it when the current work overload reduces a bit. But I<br/>have had the relatively unpleasant experience of tuning a number of<br/>transitional pianos, those made in the period of 1830-50. They<br/>definitely demonstrate a markedly noticeable degree of inharmonicity.<br/>The idea of using anything but equal on these instruments is a joke,<br/>because a pure interval doesn&apos;t exist. Equal hides the inherent<br/>inharmoncity because it keeps everything fluttering more or less<br/>equally. If you try to set anything else, what you get in an<br/>unpleasant mix of rapidly beating &quot;good&quot; intervals with rapidly<br/>fluttering &quot;bad&quot; intervals. The problem is the the &quot;good&quot; intervals<br/>aren&apos;t good enough to provide the acoustic sense of repose that<br/>unequal temperaments manifest on harmonic instruments. The whole thing<br/>just ends up sounding out of sorts.</p><p>Frankly I have never been convinced by the sound of modern pianos in<br/>historical temperaments. The sound is too far from how these<br/>temperaments sound on historical instruments for my ear, but then I<br/>came from the organ/harpsichord world and the modern piano always has<br/>been and still is a bizarre product of advanced technology. It sounds<br/>like a synthesizer to me, the tone being too loud and too long to be<br/>an acoustic instrument.</p><p>Finally, regarding the leather/felt dichotomy. The historical move has<br/>been from harpsichord-like to a muffled, dark, perhaps bell-like tone,<br/>but it was by no means any sort of universal evolution, as many books<br/>would have us believe. The earliest instrument had very thin leather,<br/>of in many cases no leather at all, just bare wood against the<br/>strings. This very bright and transparent tone ideal continued until<br/>1805 or so, when Streicher, one of the last hold-outs, made their big<br/>design change. Most other makers had long moved to leather covered<br/>hammers, though the covering was quite thin. English and French makers<br/>had already been using a considerably thicker application of multiple<br/>layers of leather, and some Viennese makers began imitating this by<br/>about 1810, particularly Streicher. His motivation is without<br/>question, as we have surviving letters between him and Haertel saying<br/>he is trying to imitate the sound of English pianos. Other Viennese<br/>makers continued the late 18th century ideal, keeping to a very thin<br/>covering of 2 or 3 layers only until 1830 or so. Graf, another big<br/>name, used many layers, like Streicher. The move to felt was primarily<br/>a practical consideration; it is considerably less labor intensive to<br/>apply one layer of felt than many layers of leather. Felt is also a<br/>more predictable raw material; leather is terrible, the acoustic<br/>quality of skins varies from fantastic to absolutely crap, something<br/>which cannot always be determined before the application. Felt does<br/>have the added advantage that it produces a duller tone, which helped<br/>to hide the inharmonicty. In many ways, the industrial production<br/>aspect of piano making has always been far more the arbiter of design<br/>considerations that the aesthetic, though they moved with a certain<br/>degree of parallelism that makers could claim the latter for<br/>promotional purposes.</p><p>Any questions?</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3><a id=79281 href="#79281">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2008 12:11:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Poletti&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ....not so sure if it is comforting or disturbing to see<br/>&gt; that some things never seem to change,<br/>&gt; like the endless debate of<br/>&gt; Bach&apos;s<br/>alleged<br/>&gt; tuning.<br/>Once in 1999, when I wangeled a dozen 5ths into JSB&apos;s squiggles,<br/>in order to fob my old friend H.A.Kellner:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25913">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25913</a></p><p>then I never expected ~not even in my wildest dreams~<br/>that my own unsmoked hoax would result in so much even<br/>denser smother out of the reeking pipes of:<br/><a href="http://www.taylorandboody.com/opuses/opus_41.htm">http://www.taylorandboody.com/opuses/opus_41.htm</a><br/>&quot;This organ is (de)tuned(?) in an unusual temperament,...&quot;</p><p>Apology:<br/>In the hope,<br/>that the squiggle-charlatanry ends up soon fully in smoke,<br/>without any residues.</p><p>Please excuse:<br/>Sorry to all those,<br/>that became bored by that entangeled &apos;Rosetta-stone&apos;d story,<br/>that sometimes got out of my control,<br/>when flogging that dead horse all to much...&amp;.c.t...</p><p>&gt; I particularly liked Thomas&apos; deconstruction of<br/>&gt; Eggar&apos;s<br/>&gt; arguments.<br/>Me too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, re: the historical development of pianos, in particular the<br/>&gt; issue of inharmonicity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Inharmonicty is caused by one thing: the relative rise in<br/>&gt; significance<br/>&gt; as a restoring force of the stiffness of the string over the<br/>&gt; normally-operative restoring force of tension....<br/>&gt; Inharmoncity is ALWAYS present in EVERY vibrating string,...</p><p>Right:<br/>Theoretically it vanishes strictly spoken only for<br/>infintesimal razor-thin and infinite long-expanded strings<br/>in the abstract terms of Fourier&apos;s harmonic analysis<br/>as linear approximation.</p><p>But in real strings the ratio inbetween length and diameter is finite.<br/>Hence the inevitable bias inbetween the partials,<br/>that causes the observed deviations from JI.</p><p>&gt; 2.

Rather, it is an integral and<br/>inherent part of natural piano tone behaviour, noticed in the<br/>scientific investigation of piano tone at least as far back as 1935<br/>(Wolf and Sette, JASA, 6, 160-168), and mentioned as early as 1907 by<br/>the piano tuner Cree Fischer (Piano tuning Â– a simple and accurate<br/>methodÂ…). It is at least in part due to the natural behaviour of piano<br/>string motion itself, which is much more complicated than as supposed<br/>by the standard theory for beats. Piano strings do not simply vibrate<br/>polarized in one plane, as the standard theory of beats requires. Nor<br/>can the transverse motions of piano strings in situ be adequately<br/>described by more generalized elliptical polarization. Rather, in<br/>general, the description of transverse piano string motion must allow<br/>for parametric loci. As early as 1943 Schuck and Young (JASA, 15, 1,<br/>1-11) suggested that what we would in the context of piano tuning call<br/>false beat phenomena, could be explained by the rotation of the plane<br/>of vibration of the piano string, and possibly by the transfer of<br/>energy from one mode to another.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is is possible to describe the audible difference in fortepianos due<br/>&gt; to &apos;locked&apos; strings of different individual frequencies, versus<br/>&gt; truly unison strings?</p><p>....<br/>In addition to the existence of two distinct types of &quot;beating&quot; in<br/>piano tuning, is the fact that bridge coupling between strings allows<br/>for the adjustment of partial decay rates and amplitudes, at least in<br/>unisons, and possibly in other intervals (Weinreich, G, &quot;Coupled piano<br/>strings&quot; JASA, 62, 1474-1484, 1977). The existence of false beats in<br/>the context of bridge coupling, presents an acoustical system in the<br/>actual piano tuning situation, which the standard theory of beats is<br/>simply not able to describe. The description provided by the latter,<br/>even taking into account inharmonicity, is a crude simplification and<br/>approximation for the actual situation. Nonetheless, it has penetrated<br/>the psyche of a good many theorists, would-be theorists, and<br/>practitioners who claim to be good tuners. It is in the nature of the<br/>human mind to attempt to fit the interpretation of experience to<br/>presumed knowledge already established in the mind, and in the case of<br/>the popular paradigm for tuning, learning from the experience of<br/>tuning Â– even correctly perceiving what is actually there - can be<br/>impeded by holding inadequate mental/theoretical models for the<br/>phenomena being encountered. The better theorists generally know from<br/>experience that a natural phenomenon is always likely to be more<br/>complicated than previously supposed, but unfortunately there are many<br/>who never question the popular paradigms.</p><p>Provided it is understood that &quot;beating&quot; and &quot;beats&quot; are somewhat<br/>generic terms, it is reasonable to say that (aural) piano tuners tune,<br/>in part, by &quot;listening to beats&quot;. However, rather than using the<br/>paradigm of tuners applying beat rates to &quot;aurally estimate&quot; some<br/>theoretically &quot;worked out&quot; tuning, perhaps a more accurate paradigm<br/>would be:</p><p>The finest piano tuning is an art, carried out by tuners drawing on a<br/>deep empirical knowledge of piano tone and tuning behaviour. All<br/>current theoretical models for piano tuning are just models. Even if<br/>we improved the model to account for the data we now have for piano<br/>tone behaviour, in the words of Samuel Karlin, The purpose of models<br/>is not to fit the data, but to sharpen the questions.&quot;</p><p>Qutation from:<br/>(Karlin, S, 11th RA Fischer Memorial Lecture, Royal Society,<br/>20/4/1983, cited in Buchanan, Mark, Ubiquity, Phoenix, 2000)</p><p>bye<br/>A.S.</p></div><h3><a id=79448 href="#79448">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2008 12:30:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Andreas Sparschuh&quot; &lt;a_sparschuh@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; &quot;False&quot; beating is not an anomalous &quot;add on&quot; to an otherwise complete<br/>&gt; picture of piano tone and tuning.
