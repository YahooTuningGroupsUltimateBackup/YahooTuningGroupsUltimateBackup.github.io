This seems to work out well, at<br/>least for this scale. It allows an ensemble of fixed-pitch instruments to<br/>handle a scale larger than any individual instrument can deal with. The<br/>basic tuning is superpelog[14], with a 260.76 cent generator and a 1206.55<br/>cent period (the Zireen love those stretched octaves!). The two hammered<br/>dulcimers are tuned to overlapping superpelog[9] scales which together<br/>cover the entire range of superpelog[14]. The two harps are each tuned to<br/>one of the interleaved pelogic[7] subsets of superpelog[14]. I allowed the<br/>complete 14-note scale for the reed organ part and the melodic instruments<br/>(although the melody is largely based on a 5-note mode).</p><p>I wanted to do a 14-ET version for comparison, but I prefer the sound of<br/>the superpelog version. Of course, it&apos;s already stretching the limits of<br/>Scala&apos;s retuning capability (if only MIDI had more than 16 channels.....)</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2004 11:05:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s an incomplete midi featuring a Zireen melody that&apos;s been floating<br/>&gt; around in my head for a while, waiting for the right tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/zireen1-superpelog.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/zireen1-superpelog.mid</a></p><p>Fun - definitely has a unique feel to it!
