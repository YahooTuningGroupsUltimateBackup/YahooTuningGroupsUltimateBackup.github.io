The<br/>12-tone system, (just like 12tet), was not an end in itself;  but rather a<br/>means to an end.</p><p>What end?  Playing around with bunch of numbers?  Well, sure, that can be<br/>fun for some;  but what do we hear happening in the resulting music?</p><p>We hear twisted, fragmented Viennese waltzes,  floaty, ambiguously<br/>harmonized tunelets,  *frequent* references to tonality, as well as<br/>frequent references to (or rather, appearances of) those favorite pet<br/>sonorities of his &quot;atonal&quot; period:  stacked 4ths/5th chords, major-minor<br/>third chords, etc. etc. These things are what pop up on the surface of his<br/>(and many other atonal or 12-tone composers) music, and they are not<br/>absolutely relegated to one tuning system or another.  For example,<br/>several Schoenberg works from the late (&quot;12 tone&quot;) period end with big<br/>major triads.  Why couldn&apos;t these be played in JI, for example?  Or all of<br/>those major-minor third chords (034 as the set theory folks say);  wasn&apos;t<br/>Dan Stearns playing with these a while back?  I&apos;d love to hear them<br/>reinterpreted in that way . . . Or how about the ending of the Berg violin<br/>concerto, that gorgeous added 6th harmony?  how about retuning that one. .<br/>. . .mmmmmmmmmm that could be tasty.</p><p>As someone who writes serial music myself, generating &quot;the numbers&quot; is<br/>only the beginning---I happen to enjoy nerding out on that stuff---but<br/>then comes the really fun part:  looking at all of the wildly random<br/>combinations of notes that I have to make into music---for [stupid]<br/>example, if I have to compose out C-E-G and then C#-D-Eb,  aaah a sweet<br/>triad and then an angry cluster---a dumbly basic illustration of the kind<br/>of thought-process I&apos;m talking about.</p><p>I have a feeling (from listening to the music) that Schoenberg thought<br/>this way, and given that that&apos;s the case---well, why not tune that C-E-G<br/>as JI, and that cluster, maybe keep it 12tet, or, I believe La Monte Young<br/>is fond of clusters like that, maybe tune it like he does. . . .</p><p>Anyway, the point is that just because a piece is &quot;12 tone&quot; doesn&apos;t mean<br/>that&apos;s the most important thing about it.  Even in music of Milton<br/>Babbitt, arguably the most arch-12-tone of them all, well, I enjoy most of<br/>all the tonal puns, 7th and other &quot;jazz&quot; chords and licks, or for example<br/>the intense foggy C# major chord 3/4 through the 2nd piano concerto. . .</p><p>And as a composer, I&apos;m cool with people re-interpreting my music, as long<br/>as the result is as cool (or cooler) than the original.</p><p>So I say, re-tune away!!</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p>212-663-2515<br/><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div>
