I<br/>wouldn&apos;t recommend that. Perhaps you meant the missing fundamental, the 1,<br/>making a triad where the interval in question is heard as part of a harmonic<br/>series above the 1. It certainly would be helpful to alternately include and<br/>exclude the 1 if you&apos;re working on hearing intervals otonally. If you want<br/>to hear intervals utonally, instead of the 1 you would alternately include<br/>and exclude n*d, the product of the numerator and denominator of the<br/>interval in question.</p><p>Also, if you indeed meant to form triads, it would be helpful to<br/>occasionally consider intervals not in lowest terms, such as 9:3.</p><p>Though I don&apos;t think intervals (even simple-ratio ones) need to be heard<br/>otonally or utonally, it certainly can help interval-identification<br/>abilities if you do hear them that way. Well, otonally, anyway.</p></div>
