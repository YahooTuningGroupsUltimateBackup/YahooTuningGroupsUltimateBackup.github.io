Double- and half-speed tape<br/>manipulation is required for _Windsong_/_Daphne of the Dunes_, _Revelation_,<br/>and _Water!

To see a DX on stage with a speaker in<br/>&quot;Delusion&quot; or any of his other works would be a far from his theater as possible. Electronics?<br/>Haven&apos;t you ever notice his almost lack of such elements as METAL. This would have given his<br/>tuning far more sustain, but his theater required something else.  What Partch didn&apos;t do is<br/>almost as important as what he did. When shown the Motorola Scalatron Organ his comment was<br/>&quot;You are 40 years too late&quot;. This comment was a comment coming from his own life theatre. I<br/>don&apos;t think he really would have use it then.<br/>    It appears that I have worked with pump organs more than anyone else on this list which is<br/>a bit of a surprise. 20 years. Something I would not even thought about. Being the case, I<br/>would like to make a few comments that might shed some light. They are very frustrating<br/>instruments for a variety of reasons of which tuning is just one. That Partch thought that<br/>Brass was a bad choice of reeds, i will disagree with . For the most part they hold their<br/>tuning over very long periods of time. Metal has a certain amount of memory as to its tuning.<br/>I believe the problem he was having was caused by something by a different phenomenon. Air<br/>Pressure. now different air pressure will change the pitch of a reed you are playing. So when<br/>tuning you have to make sure that you pump at the same speed for every reed. Now the amount of<br/>pressure between when you play one tone compared to when you play an 8 tone chord is large<br/>enough to cause a difference in pitch. I assume that Partch didn&apos;t notice (like myself) till<br/>after he made that comment. In playing these instruments one has to read adjust ones pumping<br/>speed depending on what you are playing. They are not absolute fixed pitched instruments which<br/>can make them somewhat unpredictable.  I am sure temperature would have some effect but I<br/>always tune around about 70 degrees. He might have not. Another aspect of a Pump Organ or<br/>Chromelodeon is the way it interacts with mallet instruments. They do not blend easily and<br/>things that work well alone sound bad in combination. My own use of organs with these other<br/>instruments has been so much trial and error, that  at times I abandoned there use<br/>altogether.  I am sure Bill Sethares could explain this but what i would like from such<br/>explorations is more for this type of research to tell me what would sounds good on the organ<br/>with the metal and wood. So far unisons and dyads doubled in octaves seem to sound the best to<br/>my ear. I am sure there more waiting to be discovered. Many times I have thought of using<br/>electronic instruments and use one occasionally. I can say that despite my quite different<br/>temperament from Partch, I feel the say way as him in this case.<br/>    If I hadn&apos;t read Lou Harrisons comment about designing an orchestra as opposed to an<br/>instrument(s), I probably might have fallen in to the many traps that Partch fell into. His<br/>string instrument fail to have any volume at all much less hold there tuning. The use of<br/>piano/autoharp pins would have made tighter strings possible, thus more volume. But from a<br/>theatre point of view, the latter looks better. Partch seem to make decisions that had more to<br/>do with going for his total vision as opposed to suggesting a philosophy of &quot;practicality&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Jonathan M.

The<br/>corporeal, in Partch&apos;s aesthetic, is a constant demand for authenticity in<br/>the music-theatrical experience.  Ratios of small whole numbers and their<br/>performance on instruments whose very physical character mediated between<br/>the playing body and the acoustic realization of those ratios in the<br/>theatrical space were both parts of that aesthetic. The only surrogates he<br/>seems ever to have accepted were the small instrument called on to assist<br/>the overworked kitharist and the device for simulating railroad horns (and<br/>whose very name suggests perhaps other horned contexts).</p><p>Lou Harrison&apos;s music for gamelan can, to large extent, be realized on any<br/>Javanese-style instruments, with a variety of tuning. He has made his scores<br/>widely available just for that purpose.  Understanding and accepting the<br/>varieties of realization to which that can lead is one emblem of Lou&apos;s<br/>generous and open character as well as an outgrowth of his experience with<br/>percussion music of abstract pitch and with Indonesian musical tradition.<br/>Likewise, Lou is terribly enthusiastic about David Doty&apos;s electronic<br/>realization of his &quot;Simfony in Free Style&quot;.</p><p>Partch, on the other hand,  never had much interest in publishing his scores<br/>(only two were published in full during his lifetime), both as a way of<br/>protecting his own performance monopoly and as a realization of the<br/>practical difficulties in realizing the scores. But he did will his<br/>instruments to be used in the future, rather than be destroyed in a second<br/>_auto da f&iuml;&iquest;&half;_ and his intellectual testament, _Genesis of a Music_, contains<br/>such detailed information about his instrument designs, tunings, and playing<br/>techniques, that one cannot help but read this book as an invitation to take<br/>up carpentry for oneself.</p><p>The idea of realizing a Partch score is daunting. First, forget most of what<br/>you&apos;ve previously learned about music and theatre, second, build an<br/>orchestra.... The only parallel that comes to my mind is fictional, Borge&apos;s<br/>&quot;Pierre Menard&quot;, who attempted to write _Don Quixote_ by living the life of<br/>Cervantes.  I&apos;m not suggesting that you have to spend a decade on the bum or<br/>suffer Partch&apos;s various ills and anxieties in order to play his music, but<br/>you damn well better spend some time in the American Southwest and Pacific,<br/>and a few blisters on the hands from the workbench or on the feet from<br/>pumping a reed organ are probably prerequisite to admission into this<br/>particular corner of musical paradise.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frankfurt</p></div><h3><a id=11067 href="#11067">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>7/6/2000 2:27:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In an answer to a letter to Leigh Gerdine (former President of Webster<br/>College in St. Louis, and translator of several 31-TET items, working closely<br/>with D.A. Fokker of The Netherlands), Harry Partch wrote the following on<br/>June 4, 1944:</p><p>&quot;In answer to your questions:<br/>1.  Electronic instruments.  I am tremendously interested, but I have always<br/>had to work on a small budget or none at all.  I&apos;ve had to stick to what I<br/>could do, and I&apos;ve built my entire orchestra for an amount that would hardly<br/>budget one single musical electronic experiment.</p><p>&quot;However, I do not think that I rationalize when I say that I hope we never<br/>abandon the natural world of direct sound--entirely.  Percussion is direct,<br/>the guitar is direct: the piano is not so direct, and electronic instruments<br/>generally, do not have the direct potentiality.</p><p>&quot;2. Some keyboard system.  Since you know my book you know that I built--away<br/>back in 1935--a reed organ with something resembling a typewriter keyboard.<br/>I still think that it, or something like it, is a good idea, and I&apos;ve spent<br/>many hours detailing the capabilities that I would like to see in an<br/>electronic keyboard instrument--possibly with a typewriter keyboard, with<br/>engineers.  The thousand dollars that Guggenheim gave the Microwave<br/>Laboratory for materials on this project did not lead to the hearing of a<br/>single tone, by my ears at least.  The difficulty for a composer who must get<br/>his music heard in order to survive is players.  There is at least a<br/>possibility that I will find a musician willing to play my present<br/>Chromelodeon, whereas this would become an improbability in the case of the<br/>typewriter keyboard.&quot;</p><p>(page 229 of Enclosures 3)<br/>----</p><p>This brings up many thoughts and feelings.
