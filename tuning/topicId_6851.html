I don&apos;t believe he was ever exiled from the US.  He just preferred<br/> Mexico.</p><p> -Carl &gt;&gt;</p><p>After Mr. Nancarrow&apos;s return from the Spanish Civil War, where he fought with<br/>the Lincoln Brigade, the US withdrew his passport. He was, as they say,<br/>&quot;prematurely anti-fascist&quot;.  Without a US passport, his travel was restricted<br/>to Canada or Mexico, and he found the latter more interesting and attractive.<br/> After settling in Mexico and taking Mexican citizenship, he made only one<br/>&quot;undercover&quot; trip the the US to purchase materials for equipment.  On the<br/>basis of newspaper articles (including one describing the refusal to allow<br/>Luigi Nono to attend his mother-in-law&apos;s (Gertrude Schoenberg&apos;s) funeral<br/>before the intervention of Senator Kennedy) and word-of-mouth in the old left<br/>expatriot American community in Mexico he was of the belief that he would not<br/>be allowed to visit the US. It was only late in his life, first for an<br/>appearance at the Cabrillo Music Festival in 1981, that this matter would be<br/>officially cleared up. Unfortunately, by that time his health was so weakened<br/>that he restricted himself to one trip outside Mexico each year.</p></div>
