Familiar examples of such tunings might include 41-tone equal<br/>temperament (41-tet), 29-tet, 46-tet, 17-tet, and 22-tet.</p><p>From an artistic point of view, such temperaments offer accentuated<br/>variations on standard medieval Pythagorean tuning both for 13th-14th<br/>century Western European music of the Gothic era, and for allied<br/>&quot;neo-Gothic&quot; styles of composition or improvisation. Usual Pythagorean<br/>traits such as active thirds and sixths inviting efficient resolutions<br/>to stable 3-limit concords, and narrow diatonic semitones for<br/>expressive melody and incisive cadential action, are heightened in a<br/>form of intonational mannerism.</p><p>By describing these regular temperaments beyond Pythgorean as<br/>&quot;neo-Gothic meantones,&quot; however, I elicited some predictable and<br/>constructive controversy. In a prompt response, Paul Erlich[2]<br/>questioned whether tunings with fifths wider than pure could be<br/>&quot;meantones&quot; in even &quot;the most inclusive sense.&quot;</p><p>In a germinal paper surveying the entire spectrum of regular tunings<br/>with fifths from 685 cents to 721 cents, David C. Keenan (1998)<br/>acknowledged that &quot;some authors&quot; would refer to all such tunings as<br/>meantones, only to reject this usage &quot;on historical grounds.&quot;[3]</p><p>As the result of a very helpful private dialogue with Paul Erlich, in<br/>which he introduced the word &quot;hypertone&quot;[4], I would like to propose<br/>the term &quot;hypermeantone&quot; to describe regular temperaments with fifths<br/>larger than pure. This term may be taken in at least two senses:</p><p>(1) The size of the fifths goes &quot;beyond&quot; the range of conventional<br/>meantone temperaments, a range with Pythagorean tuning (&quot;zero-comma<br/>meantone,&quot; pure fifths) as one possible upper limit.</p><p>(2) The regular major second or whole-tone, larger than 9:8, serves as<br/>a &quot;hypermeantone&quot; for some regular major third with a size going<br/>&quot;beyond&quot; the Pythagorean 81:64.</p><p>If we adopt this definition of &quot;hypermeantone,&quot; then the term<br/>&quot;hypomeantone&quot; might apply to regular tunings with fifths_smaller_<br/>than in historical meantones, with 1/3-comma meantone or 19-tet as a<br/>possible line of demarcation. One example might be 26-tet, with fifths<br/>at ~692.31 cents, or about 9.65 cents narrower than pure.[5]</p><p>From this perspective, the continuum of regular diatonic tunings with<br/>fifths ranging between the limits of 7-tet (~685.71 cents) and 5-tet<br/>(720 cents) would invite a conceptual map[6] like this.</p><p>-~16.24            -~7.22          0                          +~18.04<br/>~685.71           ~694.74       ~701.96                         720<br/>   |-----------------|-------------|------------------------------|<br/>7-tet              19-tet        Pyth                           5-tet<br/>   |-----------------|-------------|------------------------------|<br/>      hypomeantone      meantone            hypermeantone</p><p>Here signed (+/-) numbers show the tempering of the fifth in the<br/>negative (narrow) or positive (wide) direction from the pure 3:2 ratio<br/>of Pythagorean tuning (&quot;Pyth&quot;).</p><p>As the term &quot;hypermeantones&quot; may suggest, regular tunings beyond<br/>Pythagorean are at once distinct from traditional meantones and yet<br/>may share kindred aspects of structure and artful compromise. This<br/>paper seeks to explore some contrasts and parallels, while touching<br/>here and there on hypomeantones and hopefully encouraging a full<br/>exploration of these tunings also.</p><p>Section 1 offers an approach to meantones as regular tunings involving<br/>a trade-off between 3-limit and 5-limit concords, and thus having a<br/>range from about 1/3-comma (pure 6:5 minor thirds) or 19-tet to<br/>Pythagorean (pure 3:2 fifths). Hypomeantones with fifths narrower than<br/>in 19-tet, and hypermeantones with fifths wider than Pythagorean,<br/>evidently involve other kinds of compromises and balances.</p><p>Section 2 explores how hypermeantones may bring into play interactions<br/>and balances between prime limits _analogous_ to meantones, involving<br/>for example the septimal rather than syntonic comma, as in the case of<br/>22-tet as a near approximation of &quot;1/4-septimal-comma hypermeantone&quot;<br/>with pure 9:7 major thirds.</p><p>Section 3 shows how, more generally, hypermeantones may achieve or<br/>approximate higher-prime-limit ratios for various intervals, thereby<br/>facilitating an intriguing encounter between the intonational systems<br/>and musical ideals of the 14th and 21st centuries.</p><p>Section 4 considers how &quot;alternative thirds&quot; -- diminished fourths and<br/>augmented seconds -- can serve as bridges between the hypermeantone<br/>and hypomeantone portions of the spectrum.</p><p>-----------------------------------<br/>1. The meantone equation and beyond<br/>-----------------------------------</p><p>Any exploration of the &quot;meantone&quot; concept might aptly begin with the<br/>recognition that this term can mean many different things to different<br/>people, or indeed to the same person at different times.[7]</p><p>For the purposes of this paper, I would like to present a possible<br/>perspective centering on &quot;meantone&quot; as the region of a tradeoff or<br/>compromise between 3-limit and 5-limit concords, and &quot;stylistic<br/>meantone&quot; as the slightly narrower region where these concords are<br/>deemed to be in &quot;acceptable balance&quot; for tertian styles of music where<br/>both 3-limit and 5-limit intervals participate in stable sonorities.</p><p>From an historical point of view, the advent of meantone temperaments<br/>around 1450 represents an effort to achieve thirds and sixths at or<br/>near pure 5-limit ratios (M3 5:4, m3 6:5, M6 5:3, m6 8:5) while<br/>keeping fifths reasonably close to their ideal 3-limit ratio of 3:2.</p><p>Such a &quot;meantone&quot; equation or dialectic focuses on the syntonic comma<br/>by which the active Pythagorean thirds and sixths of traditional<br/>Gothic style differ from their pure 5-limit counterparts avidly sought<br/>by the mid-15th century. This comma of 81:80, or ~21.51 cents, is thus<br/>a logical as well as traditional measure of meantone temperaments.</p><p>Taking the trade-off between 3-limit and 5-limit intervals as the<br/>essence of the meantone equation, we find that this equation suggests<br/>two limiting conditions which may define boundaries of the meantone<br/>spectrum.</p><p>When fifths are narrowed by 1/3-comma (~7.17 cents), minor thirds are<br/>at a pure 6:5 and major sixths at a pure 5:3. Any further tempering<br/>would compromise these intervals as well as moving other 5-limit as<br/>well as 3-limit concords further from their ideal ratios. In 19-tet, a<br/>minutely greater amount of tempering (~7.22 cents) may be motivated by<br/>a desire for precise mathematical closure and symmetry; this tuning<br/>thus serves as a convenient lower limit.</p><p>When fifths and fourths are pure (Pythagorean tuning), any tempering<br/>in the _wide_ direction would compromise these 3-limit intervals as<br/>well as further accentuating the full comma by which thirds and sixths<br/>differ from the ideal 5-limit ratios implied by a &quot;meantone&quot; frame of<br/>discourse. Thus Pythagorean tuning or &quot;zero-comma meantone&quot; serves as<br/>one logical upper limit to the meantone spectrum.</p><p>Therefore 1/3-comma meantone or 19-tet with pure or virtually pure<br/>minor thirds, and Pythagorean tuning with pure fifths, represent the<br/>mathematical limits or boundary conditions of the 3-limit/5-limit<br/>meantone tradeoff. Hypomeantones with fifths narrower than 19-tet, and<br/>hypermeantones with fifths wider than Pythagorean, evidently reflect<br/>other tradeoffs and aesthetic possibilities.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>1.1. Stylistic meantone and 5-limit &quot;acceptability&quot;<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>From a mathematical point of view, Pythagorean tuning with pure fifths<br/>is at once the upper limit of the meantone spectrum and the lower<br/>limit of the hypermeantone spectrum.</p><p>Musically, however, this quintessential Gothic tuning and the almost<br/>identical 53-tet have a strong affinity to neo-Gothic hypermeantones.<br/>Their active and dynamic thirds and sixths superbly fit a medieval or<br/>neo-medieval style, in contrast to the Renaissance and later 5-limit<br/>styles usually associated with the term &quot;meantone.&quot;</p><p>Given this aesthetic reality, and the origin of meantone temperaments<br/>around 1450 as a calculated departure from Pythagorean tuning, the<br/>term &quot;meantone&quot; often implies a regular temperament where the fifths<br/>are narrowed sufficiently to bring thirds and sixths appreciably<br/>closer to 5-limit ratios, so that they may serve comfortably as full<br/>concords.</p><p>&quot;Stylistic meantone&quot; in this sense thus implies an &quot;acceptable<br/>balance&quot; between 3-limit and 5-limit intervals for tertian styles<br/>where both types of intervals participate in fully concordant<br/>sonorities.</p><p>Easley Blackwood[8] places an upper limit of &quot;acceptability&quot; on the<br/>size of major thirds for 5-limit music at around 406 cents, with<br/>regular fifths at around 701.5 cents (~0.46 cents narrower than pure,<br/>or ~1/47-comma meantone). This is the point where such thirds become<br/>just restful enough to form stable triads -- or, from another point of<br/>view, where they are just approaching a Gothic/neo-Gothic level of<br/>activity and energy.</p><p>If we adopt Blackwood&apos;s limit as a useful conceptual guide, then the<br/>spectrum of &quot;stylistic meantones&quot; ranges from our lower limit of<br/>19-tet or 1/3-comma meantone to an upper limit slightly below<br/>Pythagorean (with fifths at around 701.5 cents).[9]</p><p>From this perspective, the rather narrow border zone between 701.5<br/>cents and 53-tet or Pythagorean is technically still within the<br/>meantone region but musically is more of a portal or antechamber to<br/>the world of Gothic and neo-Gothic intonations.[10]</p><p>Transition zones and fuzzy boundaries of this kind should be seen not<br/>as a flaw but as an enticing feature of maps, whether geographical or<br/>conceptual, especially as we focus on finer levels of detail.[11]</p><p>------------------------<br/>1.2. Meantone and beyond<br/>------------------------</p><p>For the purposes of this paper, we have defined the meantone spectrum<br/>as the region of compromise between 3-limit and 5-limit intervals, or<br/>the slightly narrower region where an &quot;acceptable balance&quot; is struck<br/>between these intervals for Renaissance and later tertian European<br/>styles.</p><p>Hypomeantones with fifths narrower than in 19-tet or 1/3-comma<br/>meantone, and hypermeantones with fifths wider than Pythagorean,<br/>belong to different although related musical universes on the larger<br/>continuum of regular tunings from 7-tet to 5-tet.</p><p>&quot;Stylistic meantones&quot; in our rather broad sense (including 12-tet),<br/>and also the irregular well-temperaments favored for European keyboard<br/>music during the era of around 1680-1850, reflect a musical imperative<br/>to make both 3-limit and 5-limit intervals acceptable stable concords.</p><p>With hypomeantones and hypermeantones, a variety of other styles,<br/>balances, and artful compromises may apply, in some cases analogous to<br/>those of meantones. The remainder of this paper focuses primarily on<br/>hypermeantones in the range from Pythagorean to 22-tet or 27-tet as<br/>used for Gothic or neo-Gothic styles of music, with hypomeantone<br/>connections briefly considered in Section 4.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. New balances: hypermeantones and the septimal comma<br/>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In Gothic and neo-Gothic styles of music based at once on a 3-limit of<br/>stability (with fifths and fourths the most complex stable concords)<br/>and a subtle scale of relative concord/discord, Pythagorean tuning<br/>serves as a classic starting point for various forms of intonational<br/>mannerism. Unstable intervals may be &quot;attracted&quot; to various ratios<br/>based on higher prime limits.</p><p>In such a setting, neo-Gothic tunings including hypermeantones may<br/>typically be subject to the following basic constraints:</p><p>(1) Stable 3-limit concords should remain within &quot;acceptable&quot; limits;</p><p>(2) Other regular intervals should remain &quot;recognizable&quot; as variants<br/>on their standard Pythagorean forms, e.g. with wide major thirds and<br/>sixths distinguishable from fourths or minor sevenths[12]; and</p><p>(3) At least in more &quot;classical&quot; styles, these intervals should fit<br/>13th-14th century orderings of relative concord/discord, with a bare<br/>major third, for example, being _relatively_ blending and somewhat<br/>more &quot;concordant&quot; than a relatively tense bare major second.</p><p>In the complex 3-limit setting of Gothic or neo-Gothic music, one very<br/>viable approach to this intonational equation is to avoid temperament,<br/>instead extending Pythagorean just intonation to obtain new flavors of<br/>intervals while retaining all of the traditional medieval ones.</p><p>For example, suppose we feel an attraction toward an extra-wide<br/>cadential major third at 9:7 (~435.08 cents) resolving to a stable<br/>fifth. In a Xeno-Gothic tuning (24-note Pythagorean mapped to two<br/>12-note keyboards a Pythagorean comma apart), the interval formed by<br/>16 fifths in the upward direction will serve nicely for this<br/>purpose. At ~431.28 cents, this interval is only about 3.80 cents<br/>narrower than a pure 9:7 -- and precisely a Pythagorean comma wider<br/>than the usual major third at 81:64 (~407.82 cents).</p><p>Using a &quot;@&quot; symbol to show a note lowered by a Pythagorean comma, and<br/>a MIDI-like notation with C4 as middle C, we could therefore notate<br/>such a Xeno-Gothic cadence as follows:</p><p> B3  --  +67 -- C@4<br/>(431)          (702)<br/> G@3 -- -204 -- F@3</p><p>Here the numbers in parentheses show vertical intervals in cents,<br/>while signed numbers show ascending or descending melodic intervals in<br/>cents.</p><p>Both the &quot;superwide&quot; major third at ~431 cents, and &quot;supercompact&quot;<br/>diatonic semitone in the upper voice at ~66.76 cents (a Pythagorean<br/>comma narrower than the usual 256:243 at ~90.22 cents) are &quot;special<br/>effects&quot; intervals. At the same time, the melodic motion in the lower<br/>voice by a pure 9:8 whole-tone (~203.91 cents), and the resolution to<br/>a pure 3:2 fifth, are normal features of Pythagorean just intonation<br/>which we retain in our extended tuning.</p><p>The obvious complication as well as artistic opportunity of such a<br/>system is that it calls on the performer to negotiate comma<br/>distinctions. Suppose we desire a simpler system where regular major<br/>thirds (formed by a chain of four fifths) are at or near a pure 9:7.</p><p>In order to make four regular fifths add up to a 9:7 major third, we<br/>must disperse the septimal comma of 64:63 (~27.26 cents) which defines<br/>the difference, for example, between a usual Pythagorean major third<br/>at 81:64 and a 7-limit major third at 9:7 (or 81:63). Each fifth must<br/>therefore be tempered in the wide direction by 1/4 of this comma, or<br/>~6.82 cents, resulting in a size of ~708.77 cents.</p><p>In this tuning, each regular major second serves as a &quot;hypermeantone&quot;<br/>of ~217.54 cents, equal to precisely half of a pure 9:7 major third,<br/>and to the geometric mean of the unequal 9:8 and 8:7 whole-tones<br/>forming a 9:7 third.[13] These hypermeantones are 1/2 septimal comma<br/>(~13.63 cents) wider than the Pythagorean 9:8, so that two of them<br/>produce a major third a full septimal comma wider than 81:64 (i.e. our<br/>desired 9:7).</p><p>The following diagram shows this hypermeantone temperament scheme,<br/>with &quot;SC&quot; standing for the septimal comma:</p><p>            + 1/4 SC    + 1/4 SC    + 1/4 SC   + 1/4 SC<br/>          |-----------|-----------|----------|----------|<br/>          C           G           D          A          E<br/>          |-----------------------|---------------------|<br/>                  + 1/2 SC               + 1/2 SC<br/>          |---------------------------------------------|<br/>                            + 1 SC (9:7)</p><p>We might call this tuning &quot;1/4-septimal-comma hypermeantone,&quot; closely<br/>analogous in structure to the familiar 1/4-(syntonic)-comma meantone<br/>with its pure 5:4 major thirds. The aesthetic and musical qualities<br/>of these temperaments are, of course, radically different.</p><p>The most obvious compromise of our pure 9:7 hypermeantone tuning is<br/>the tempering of the fifths (and fourths) by about 6.82 cents, an<br/>amount approaching that in 1/3-comma meantone (~7.17 cents) or 19-tet<br/>(~7.22 cents), and also the tempering of major seconds and minor<br/>sevenths by a full 1/2 septimal comma in the context of such<br/>relatively concordant sonorities as 4:6:9, 6:8:9, 8:9:12, or 9:12:16.</p><p>Just as minor thirds in 1/4-comma meantone are tempered in the narrow<br/>direction by the same amount as the fifths (~5.38 cents in relation to<br/>6:5 and 3:2 respectively), so in our 1/4-septimal-comma temperament<br/>the minor thirds are 1/4 septimal comma (~6.82 cents) wider than a<br/>pure 7:6, or about 273.69 cents. Major sixths are narrower than a pure<br/>12:7 by the same amount.</p><p>While the tempering of our prime concords by almost 7 cents may be a<br/>less than ideal compromise, this tuning in an appropriate timbre can<br/>indeed meet typical constraints of neo-Gothic style. Stable 3-limit<br/>intervals remain within acceptable limits, and other intervals remain<br/>&quot;recognizable&quot; variants of the usual Pythagorean intervals. Both the<br/>7-limit and near-7-limit intervals of this tuning, and its very narrow<br/>diatonic semitones at ~56.14 cents, contribute to its flavor.</p><p>Interestingly, there is a well-known equal temperament quite close to<br/>1/4-septimal-comma hypermeantone: 22-tet, with fifths tempered by<br/>~7.14 cents, and major thirds just slightly larger than 9:7 (~436.36<br/>cents, or ~1.28 cents wide). Here the diatonic semitone of 1 step<br/>(~54.55 cents) is literally a &quot;quartertone&quot; in relation to the major<br/>second of 4 steps (~218.18 cents).[14]</p><p>Another equal temperament, albeit one calling for special timbral<br/>conditions in a neo-Gothic setting, very closely approximates<br/>1/3-septimal-comma hypermeantone with pure 7:6 minor thirds: 27-tet,<br/>with fifths at ~711.11 cents (~9.15 cents wider than pure). Here the<br/>minor thirds at ~266.67 cents are only ~0.20 cents narrower than 7:6,<br/>and the major sixths wider than 12:7 by the same amount.</p><p>Thus our situation is very close to that shown in the following<br/>diagram, where three upward fourths each narrowed by 1/3 septimal<br/>comma (~9.09 cents) produce a regular minor third at a pure 7:6, a<br/>septimal comma narrower than the usual Pythagorean 32:27 (~294.13<br/>cents).</p><p>              - 1/3 SC         - 1/3 SC          - 1/3 SC<br/>        |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|<br/>        D                 G                 C                 F<br/>        |-----------------------------------------------------|<br/>                              - 1 SC (7:6)</p><p>Just as in the usual 1/3-comma meantone we have pure 6:5 minor thirds<br/>and major thirds 1/3 comma narrower than 5:4, so in 1/3-septimal-comma<br/>hypermeantone the major thirds are 1/3 septimal comma wider than a<br/>pure 9:7 (~444.17 cents). In 27-tet, they are ~444.44 cents.</p><p>With a somewhat gamelan-like timbre, 27-tet can be an enchanting<br/>neo-Gothic tuning, with the fifths and fourths quite acceptable as<br/>stable concords, and the very wide major thirds not only<br/>&quot;recognizable&quot; but quite pleasant. Near-pure ~7:6 minor thirds<br/>contracting to unisons, and ~12:7 major sixths expanding to octaves,<br/>lend a special flavor to standard Gothic progressions, along with the<br/>diatonic semitone (literally a fifthtone) of ~44.44 cents.</p><p>As these examples of 1/4- and 1/3-septimal-comma tunings (approximated<br/>by 22-tet and 27-tet) may suggest, neo-Gothic hypermeantones may<br/>involve some of the same interactions and compromises between prime<br/>limits as conventional meantones. Such relationships may extend to a<br/>variety of intervals and prime factors.</p><p>---------------<br/>Notes to Part 1<br/>---------------</p><p>1.

Keenan, &quot;Harmonic errors in single-chain-of-equal-fifths<br/>tunings&quot; (1998; updated 1999), available on World Wide Web at<br/><a href="http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/1ChainOfFifthsTunings.htm">http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/1ChainOfFifthsTunings.htm</a>. See<br/>the section &quot;Familiar regions&quot; on the issue of defining meantones.</p><p>4. Erlich remarked that a major second in a regular tuning with fifths<br/>wider than pure would not be a &quot;mean-tone&quot; of some major third which<br/>&quot;comes out closer to 5:4&quot; than the Pythagorean 81:64, but rather a<br/>&quot;hypertone.&quot; He suggests a necessary condition that a meantone tuning<br/>have a major second which is a &quot;mean-tone&quot; in the sense of being<br/>somewhere _between_ the 9:8 and 10:9 whole-tones forming a pure 5:4 in<br/>5-limit just intonation. (Often the term &quot;mean-tone&quot; refers uniquely<br/>to the major second of 1/4-comma meantone, the exact geometric mean of<br/>9:8 and 10:9.) In contrast, the major second of a tuning with fifths<br/>wider than pure exceeds 9:8, and is thus Erlich&apos;s &quot;hypertone&quot; -- or my<br/>&quot;hypermeantone of some major third greater than 81:64.&quot;</p><p>5. The term &quot;hypermeantone&quot; might just as logically refer to tunings<br/>with fifths _smaller_ than in historical meantone tunings -- that is,<br/>tunings where the meantone process of narrowing the fifths is carried<br/>to a degree &quot;beyond&quot; historical practice. I am indebted to Paul Erlich<br/>both for this point and for the example of 26-tet.</p><p>6. For a different and very engaging map, see Keenan, note 3 above.<br/>Exploring and comparing a variety of conceptual maps of the spectrum<br/>of regular tunings may make us aware of landmarks which might be<br/>overlooked in any one view.</p><p>7. Thus I find it quite natural to ask whether a German organ piece<br/>from around 1450 &quot;sounds better in Pythagorean or meantone,&quot; or<br/>whether a Spanish lute piece from around 1540 &quot;sounds better in<br/>meantone or 12-tet.&quot; Here the term &quot;meantone&quot; suggests the range of<br/>historical temperaments from about 1/3-comma to 1/6-comma favored as<br/>keyboard tunings during the era of around 1450-1680. In other<br/>contexts, however, I might include 12-tet (&quot;1/11-comma meantone&quot;) or<br/>even Pythagorean (&quot;zero-comma meantone&quot;) as meantone tunings.</p><p>8. Easley Blackwood, _The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_<br/>(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), pp. 202-203.</p><p>9. For Blackwood&apos;s limit as a possible upper bound of meantone -- my<br/>&quot;stylistic meantone&quot; -- I am much indebted to Paul Erlich. A regular<br/>tuning at Blackwood&apos;s limit might be the best solution for<br/>compositions inviting a &quot;Pythagorean-like&quot; approach where diatonic<br/>semitones are noticeably narrower than chromatic semitones, and sharps<br/>higher than corresponding flats (e.g. Ab-G#), but where 5-limit<br/>triadic sonorities are common. Following Johnny Reinhard&apos;s thesis on<br/>the &quot;Pythagorean&quot; intentions of Charles Ives for some of his works,<br/>this tuning would fit such intentions while permitting some degree of<br/>cohesion for 5-limit triads built from regular thirds.</p><p>10. This border region is also the domain of &quot;schismic&quot; or &quot;skhismic&quot;<br/>temperaments emulating 5-limit just intonation, where the diminished<br/>fourth is tuned and remapped as a pure 5:4 major third, or the<br/>augmented second as a pure 6:5 minor third. These temperaments are<br/>often measured by the schisma (32805:32768, ~1.95 cents) by which a<br/>Pythagorean diminished fourth at 8192:6561 (~384.36 cents) falls short<br/>of a pure 5:4 (~386.31 cents), and a Pythagorean augmented second at<br/>19683:16834 (~317.60 cents) exceeds a pure 6:5 (~315.64 cents). Thus a<br/>1/8-schisma temperament (fifths ~701.71 cents, ~0.24 cents narrow)<br/>yields pure 5:4 diminished fourths, while a 1/9-schisma temperament<br/>(fifths ~701.74 cents, ~0.22 cents narrow) yields pure 6:5 augmented<br/>seconds.</p><p>11. Such border regions may lend themselves to various perspectives.<br/>For example, a wider &quot;semi-meantone/semi-Gothic&quot; zone from around<br/>12-tet to Blackwood&apos;s limit (fifths ~700-701.5 cents) might better<br/>capture the ambivalence of this territory, with 12-tet featuring<br/>&quot;Pythagorean&quot; as well as &quot;stylistic meantone&quot; qualities. Keenan, n. 3<br/>above, places the boundary between his &quot;meantone&quot; and &quot;Pythagorean&quot;<br/>regions at 12-tet.</p><p>12. The deliberate bending of such categories is a feature of<br/>&quot;ultra-Gothic&quot; music, where an interval such as 19 steps in 24-tet<br/>(950 cents) or 23 steps in 29-tet (~951.72 cents) can serve as either<br/>a very wide major sixth inviting expansion to an octave or a very<br/>narrow minor seventh inviting contraction to a fifth. In these<br/>tunings, a major third one step larger than usual -- 9/24 octave (450<br/>cents), 11/29 octave (~455.17 cents) -- expanding to a fifth has a<br/>similar effect of &quot;blurring&quot; or &quot;warping&quot; familiar categories, the<br/>latter term in an ultra-Gothic context carrying the pleasant<br/>connotation of &quot;travelling through a new space.&quot;</p><p>13. Note that in our Xeno-Gothic example of a near-9:7 major third<br/>resolving to a fifth, this third G@-B can likewise be divided into two<br/>unequal whole-tones of 9:8 and ~8:7: G@-A@ and A@-B, or G@-A and A-B.<br/>In each division, one of the whole-tones exceeds the usual 9:8 by<br/>precisely a Pythagorean comma (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents), and has a<br/>size of 4782969:4194304 (~227.37 cents, ~3.80 cents narrow of 8:7).</p><p>14. As I emphasize in my paper on neo-Gothic tunings (n. 1 above),<br/>this description of whole-tones and semitones in 22-tet assumes a<br/>Pythagorean interpretation of the tuning; for another outlook<br/>producing very different interval definitions, see Paul Erlich,<br/>&quot;Tuning, Tonality, and Twenty-Two-Tone Temperament,&quot; _Xenharmonikon_<br/>17 (Spring 1988), pp. 12-40.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=79771 href="#79771">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;straub@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/8/2009 9:04:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;M.

Familiar examples of such tunings<br/>&gt; might include 41-tone equal temperament (41-tet), 29-tet, 46-tet,<br/>&gt; 17-tet, and 22-tet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From an artistic point of view, such temperaments offer accentuated<br/>&gt; variations on standard medieval Pythagorean tuning both for<br/>&gt; 13th-14th century Western European music of the Gothic era, and for<br/>&gt; allied &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; styles of composition or improvisation. Usual<br/>&gt; Pythagorean traits such as active thirds and sixths inviting<br/>&gt; efficient resolutions to stable 3-limit concords, and narrow<br/>&gt; diatonic semitones for expressive melody and incisive cadential<br/>&gt; action, are heightened in a form of intonational mannerism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By describing these regular temperaments beyond Pythgorean as<br/>&gt; &quot;neo-Gothic meantones,&quot; however, I elicited some predictable and<br/>&gt; constructive controversy. In a prompt response, Paul Erlich[2]<br/>&gt; questioned whether tunings with fifths wider than pure could be<br/>&gt; &quot;meantones&quot; in even &quot;the most inclusive sense.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a germinal paper surveying the entire spectrum of regular tunings<br/>&gt; with fifths from 685 cents to 721 cents, David C. Keenan (1998)<br/>&gt; acknowledged that &quot;some authors&quot; would refer to all such tunings as<br/>&gt; meantones, only to reject this usage &quot;on historical grounds.&quot;[3]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As the result of a very helpful private dialogue with Paul Erlich,<br/>&gt; in which he introduced the word &quot;hypertone&quot;[4], I would like to<br/>&gt; propose the term &quot;hypermeantone&quot; to describe regular temperaments<br/>&gt; with fifths larger than pure. This term may be taken in at least<br/>&gt; two senses:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) The size of the fifths goes &quot;beyond&quot; the range of conventional<br/>&gt; meantone temperaments, a range with Pythagorean tuning (&quot;zero-comma<br/>&gt; meantone,&quot; pure fifths) as one possible upper limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) The regular major second or whole-tone, larger than 9:8, serves<br/>&gt; as a &quot;hypermeantone&quot; for some regular major third with a size going<br/>&gt; &quot;beyond&quot; the Pythagorean 81:64.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we adopt this definition of &quot;hypermeantone,&quot; then the term<br/>&gt; &quot;hypomeantone&quot; might apply to regular tunings with fifths_smaller_<br/>&gt; than in historical meantones, with 1/3-comma meantone or 19-tet as a<br/>&gt; possible line of demarcation. One example might be 26-tet, with<br/>&gt; fifths at ~692.31 cents, or about 9.65 cents narrower than pure.[5]</p><p>I am probably a few years late - but let me express that I am not<br/>really happy with this definition of &quot;hypermeantone&quot;, for the<br/>following reason:</p><p>The basic idea of meantone, AFAIK, (the historical one, at least,) is<br/>to lower the fifth a little to get purer major thirds. Now, when I<br/>hear the term &quot;hyper-meantone&quot;, I translate it as &quot;more meantone than<br/>conventional meantone&quot;, from which I would conclude that this<br/>describes a tuning whose fifth &icirc;s even LOWER than that of conventional<br/>meantone. For a fifth higher than conventional meantone, I would<br/>prefer &quot;reverse-meantone&quot;, or maybe &quot;anti-meantone&quot;<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div>
