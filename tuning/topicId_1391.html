The inverse of a<br/>non-square matrix is not defined.</p><p>Monzo:</p><p>&gt;the result my spreadsheet gave me<br/>&gt;was 0.  What does this mean?</p><p>In my terminology, the intervals you chose are not a basis.  The determinant</p><p>| 4 -1  0|<br/>|-2  0 -1|<br/>| 2 -1 -1|</p><p>means equating the intervals (4 -1 0)h (-2 0 -1)h and (2 -1 -1)h.  However,<br/>any two of these will give the third.  (4 -1 0)h = (2 -1 -1)h - (-2 0 -1)h.<br/>So, one interval is redundant.</p><p>So the thing I was playing with a month or so ago is Wilson&apos;s scale tree.  I<br/>couldn&apos;t work it out from the web page.  Anyway, there is another<br/>interpretation.  Take this:</p><p>       2                                                  3<br/>                                5<br/>                    7                       8<br/>               9         12          13          11<br/>           11    16   19    17    18     21   19    14<br/>         13 20 25 23 26 31 29 22 23 31 34 29 27 30 25 17</p><p>5 is derived from 2 and 3.  This means a 5 note MOS has 2 intervals of one<br/>size and 3 of another.  Similarly a 7 note MOS has 5 intervals of one size<br/>and 2 of another and a 12 note MOS has 5 intervals of one size and 7 of<br/>another.</p><p>The sizes of the generating intervals follow the same pattern.  Has this<br/>been mentioned?  Also, an m&amp;n scale, where n of one interval and m of the<br/>other make up an &quot;octave&quot;, can be an MOS iff m and n are mutually prime.</p><p>The neutral scale I mentioned a while ago is an MOS with the generating<br/>interval a neutral third.  Hence the &quot;symmetric&quot; tag I applied to it.</p><p>The time I tried an acoustic piano, it probably wasn&apos;t very well adjusted.<br/>I could press the keys down alright, but no sound came out.  I ended up<br/>poking it with one finger to get the necessary force.  The kids who&apos;d had<br/>piano lessons had no trouble, so it&apos;s all in the action.</p><p>Carl Lumma:</p><p>&gt;I think somebody said they could play faster on an electric piano than an<br/>&gt;acoustic one.  Many harpsichordists say their instrument is faster too.</p><p>I said I was faster on a cheap keyboard than an electric piano.  This was<br/>because &quot;pressing&quot; the keys worked better with the cheap keyboard.  I also<br/>said it was easier to control dynamics with the expensive one.  Ideally, I&apos;d<br/>have one of each depending on what kind of music I wanted to play.</p><p>&gt;Maybe for runs.  But ask yourself why nobody plays Rachmaninov on a synth.</p><p>Yes.  Rachmaminov wrote for a particular instrument, so you wouldn&apos;t expect<br/>the music to transfer to another one.  I keep asking myself why people still<br/>play Bach on a piano, and &quot;conservatism&quot; seems to be the answer.</p><p>&gt;There&apos;s more to speed than runs.  Repetition is the most important place to<br/>&gt;have speed, and the piano has got everything else beat by a mile.</p><p>Rubbish.  Sequencers are the thing.  Record once, loop it, double the<br/>tempo...</p><p>&gt;Because<br/>&gt;the keys have momentum and move independently of one&apos;s finger, and because<br/>&gt;the action has momentum and moves independently of the key.</p><p>Ah.  Is this for repeating the same note?</p><p>&gt;It should not be difficult to build a synth action that has all the<br/>&gt;desirable properties of a piano action, and requires no regulation.  It<br/>&gt;should also be possible to design synth actions that do new types of<br/>&gt;things, that pianos don&apos;t.</p><p>Sure.  Regardless of the keyboards, though, there are some places where<br/>synths have the upper hand.  One is that it&apos;s much easier to retune a synth.<br/>This is the killer for me.  Another is that you can get a higher variety of<br/>sounds from a synth.  Only playing one voice at a time as if it were an<br/>acoustic instrument isn&apos;t showing it in its best light.  For that matter,<br/>using the preset voices doesn&apos;t give me what I want.</p><p>I&apos;m not much interested in a synth that sounds like any particular acoustic<br/>instrument.  I am interested in one that plays in a less stale way.  For a<br/>sample base synth, this would mean cross-fading between samples as I go up<br/>and down the keyboard, or the key velocity changes.  My TX81Z, bless it, is<br/>great for this.  If you don&apos;t like the sound, try sending it through guitar<br/>effects.</p><p>Yes, the quantum harmonics stuff I mentioned before is pretty much fuzzy<br/>logic.  It&apos;s still close to QM in that they can both come from probability<br/>matrices.</p><p>The thing about this American Indian tribe and colours is a bit deeper than<br/>has been mentioned.  As well as having a single name for blue and green,<br/>they were found to consider blue and green as more related than native<br/>English speakers.  I don&apos;t know if similar experiments have been done with<br/>French/English speakers and different kinds of brown.</p><p>Another set of experiments was done with people who speak languages where<br/>pitch carries meaning.  I think Mandarin Chinese, Thai and Swedish are<br/>examples, I don&apos;t know who the experiments were done with.  It was found<br/>that they perceived pitch with different parts of their brains, so it was<br/>more to do with meaning than emotion.</p></div>
