I wrote two short pieces<br/>in it a couple of years ago.  It has a very interesting set<br/>of strengths and weaknesses.  I really like having the 11:6<br/>and 13:12 on either side of the 12:12 tonic, sort of fat<br/>semitones.  One of the pieces I wrote uses a bass ostinato<br/>that emphasizes that characteristic (picked bass guitar in<br/>straight 8th note rhythm):</p><p>12-13-12-11-12-13-12-11-12-11-12-11-12-13-12-11 repeat ad<br/>infinitum</p><p>Makes me feel like I&apos;m half weightless after a couple of<br/>minutes of it, which is good since I wrote it for a custom<br/>level of a computer game set in space.  Strange that a<br/>tuning that looks so &quot;natural&quot; on the surface would easily<br/>sound so un-earthly.  I guess it&apos;s because the primes are<br/>out of proportion with their occurrence in nature?  The way<br/>I used it, I mean, not necessarily the tuning itself.</p><p>Actually, now that I look at the sequence more carefully, I<br/>see that I added 27:12 (9:8) to the mix, as well, and used<br/>it to help achieve a more triadic/modulating sound,<br/>especially in the bridge.</p><p>You&apos;re right, of course, about the high degree of<br/>consonance, as would be expected for a set of relatively low<br/>harmonic relationships.</p><p>Dead end path?  I guess it depends on where you&apos;re trying to<br/>get to.  I have yet to find a tuning that I&apos;d describe that<br/>way.  As with any other, try to compose to its strengths and<br/>make creative use of its weaknesses and you&apos;re bound to get<br/>somewhere interesting, though it might not be where you<br/>expected to end up.</p><p>I don&apos;t have a full-blown website at the moment but I&apos;ll put<br/>up a page with just those two MIDI files on it, and maybe<br/>add Real Audio versions after the weekend/holiday.  The URL<br/>will be:</p><p><a href="http://www.tcinternet.net/users/jfinnamore/df/12tat.html">http://www.tcinternet.net/users/jfinnamore/df/12tat.html</a></p><p>I like that suggestion, 12-tat! :-)  The page should be up<br/>within a few hours if I can find the old<br/>SoundBlaster-compatible versions.</p><p>David J.

I prefer the above mode to the one you list later on.  BTW, Fred, there&apos;s a little convention on the list: the colon for an interval (distance), the slash for a note (frequency).  So...</p><p>1/1  24/23  13/12  7/6  5/4  4/3  17/12  3/2  19/12  5/3  7/4  11/6</p><p>...would be the preferred way to write the scale.</p><p>&gt;Has anyone explored the possibilities of this scale, or written in it?<br/>&gt;Or is it so restrictive that it is a dead-end path?</p><p>It isn&apos;t the most versatile scale you&apos;ll ever use.  But it is a fairly interesting way to use tune 12 notes in extended JI.  Usually, modes of the harmonic series starting on a power of 2 are better, however, while it is subharmonic modes that tend to work best when started on a 3 (or octave extension thereof).  If 12 is the number, this leads to the following scale...</p><p>1/1  12/11  9/8  6/5  5/4  4/3  11/8  3/2  13/8  12/7  7/4  15/8</p><p>...which we owe to Denny Genovese.  This contains harmonics 8-16 and subharmonics 6-12.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3>Prent Rodgers &#x3C;prodgers@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/1999 9:33:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Fred Reinagel wrote on Thu, 27 May 1999 16:15:25:</p><p>&quot;Has anyone on the list ever played around with this scale:</p><p>1:1  13:12  7:6  5:4  4:3  17:12  3:2  19:12  5:3  7:4  11:6  23:12<br/>2:1&quot;</p><p>I made a struck brass pipe metalophone instrument once with 24 tones,<br/>the 13th through the 26th partials of A-110. It was the only instrument<br/>I had with that tuning, and I made it just to experiment with higher<br/>partials. Its best characteristic was demonstrated when I dropped it.<br/>First was the shock value of a musician throwing an instrument on the<br/>floor, with the loud SMACK as it hit the cement, then a perceptions of a<br/>tone cluster of very loud high tones, then suddenly a very pronounced<br/>low tone, made of the difference tones of the cluster. It was clearly a<br/>low A-110, like a low hum. Made a nice ending for our 80&apos;s space music<br/>concerts in San Francisco.</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Mercer Island, WA</p></div>
