Well, it DOESN&apos;T, it all comes<br/>&gt; together nicely, which leads me to conclude that the INTEGRATION of<br/>&gt; the hexany can only be appreciated through such a GESTALT approach,<br/>&gt; and not by playing it in a typically scalar fashion...</p><p>Thanks, I really look forward to hearing what he is doing.
