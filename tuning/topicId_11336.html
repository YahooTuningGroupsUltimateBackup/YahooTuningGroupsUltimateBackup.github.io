It&apos;s a criterion for<br/>determining<br/>&gt;what are good fits, of which there are always more than one.  The decision<br/>&gt;of how to represent the Pythagorean diatonic could simply be, take the<br/>&gt;lowest n which gives a good fit (since this is a translation between one<br/>&gt;mathematical description and another, we have to give a tolerance in this<br/>&gt;case.  For translations from heard music to a representation, other factors<br/>&gt;such as cultural indoctrination may also play a role, but I presume that we<br/>&gt;will be able to specify by some other criteria which intervals must be the<br/>&gt;same, and which different).</p><p>So you&apos;re saying that _all_ scales are perceptually forced into the lowest<br/>equal temperament which gives a good fit? That kind of assumption may sit<br/>well with theorists like Balzano and Clough-Carey-Clampitt, who&apos;ve<br/>&quot;explained&quot; a lot of things on these sorts of bases, but I don&apos;t buy it, not<br/>one bit -- there&apos;s always a better, more acoustical explanation, with fewer<br/>arbitrary assumptions.</p><p>Equal temperament is a contrivance that offers many great benefits, but I<br/>don&apos;t believe it is of perceptual origin (though in the _particular_ case of<br/>the Pythagorean scale the fit to 12 is so good that it is hard to avoid,<br/>even perceptually).</p><p>&gt;Yes, and this fact gives us a useful method of finding the generator of<br/>&gt;the scale at any step of the process.  But here&apos;s where I cash in on the<br/>&gt;observation above that each choice of a previous number of places to go<br/>&gt;back to find the number to add to the last, given the weak criterion, gives<br/>&gt;a unique l:s in the following scale: to explain the value of the strong<br/>&gt;criteria.  If the choice is always 1, then l:s is always 2:1.</p><p>??? Actually, it approaches 1:phi, unless you&apos;re dealing with a Yasser-type<br/>situation where you use an equal temperament which is chosen by using the<br/>next term in the sequence (i.e., using an additional &quot;choice of 1&quot;).</p></div>
