She uses five to six notes per<br/>string. I use four notes per string, as there are four fingers on the<br/>fretting hand, and it makes it easier to jump around. Five of the ten<br/>positions are very easy for guitarists who already know how to play<br/>the pentatonic scale. Just play a pentatonic scale (in any of the<br/>five positions) with your 1st and 3rd fingers, and play the same<br/>pentatonic scale two frets higher with your 2nd and 4th fingers. For<br/>example:</p><p>| | | | | |<br/>| | | | | |<br/>| | | | | |<br/>| | | | | |<br/>| | 1 1 | |<br/>1 1 | | 1 1<br/>| | 2 2 | |<br/>2 2 | | 2 2<br/>| | | | | |<br/>3 3 3 3 3 3<br/>| | | | | |<br/>4 4 4 4 4 4<br/>| | | | | |<br/>| | | | | |<br/>| | | | | |<br/>| | | | | |</p><p>Try this for the other four pentatonic positions, and you&apos;ll<br/>immediately know how to play half of the decatonic positions! (though<br/>to make decatonic music, you should know your tetradic arpeggios as<br/>well . . .)</p></div>
