But I don&apos;t think that or any<br/>of the reasons you keep offering for not liking it (or rather for not<br/>thinking it&apos;s important/useful in some way) address any of the reasons<br/>why I think it is.</p><p>I guess the most important of those would be the relation to the<br/>Moment of Symmetry... if I hadn&apos;t of seen the two term M-out-of-N<br/>connection there I probably never would&apos;ve seen the three term<br/>L-out-of-M-out-of-N scales. And seeing this connection helped me solve<br/>a very difficult problem.</p><p>No maximal evenness then no seeing single generator interpretations<br/>for fractional periodicity. No maximal evenness and no seeing a global<br/>ordering method for the steps of N-bonacci type scales... (etceteras)</p><p>In short, I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t take your word for it on ME!</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2004 7:28:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>someone please write a good definition of<br/>&quot;maximal evenness&quot; for me.  thanks.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2004 12:31:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; someone please write a good definition of<br/>&gt; &quot;maximal evenness&quot; for me.  thanks.</p><p>Isn&apos;t that what Blackwood is getting at in his chapters about spirals<br/>of infinite meantone, or infinite Pythagorean?

Feel free to use it or<br/>clarify it further.</p><p>A scale is maximally even if there are no more than two different interval<br/>sizes for each interval class (this can be seen with SHOW INTERVALS), and<br/>if<br/>the difference between each size of interval per interval class is less<br/>than<br/>one scale step. Originally, this one scale step was intended to be the step<br/>of<br/>some equal tempered scale from which a subset was taken.<br/>Both versions of this property are shown by SHOW DATA. If the scale is a<br/>subset of an equal temperament with less than 1200 tones and maximally<br/>even,<br/>it&apos;s said that it&apos;s ME for that particular equal temperament. For the more<br/>general version, it&apos;s said that it&apos;s ME for L / S &lt;= 2, the ratio of the<br/>size of larger step (step being interval of class 1) to the size of the<br/>smallest step must be less than or equal to two. See also FIT/MODE.</p><p>A weaker form, distributional evenness, is also mentioned by SHOW DATA. For<br/>this the scale must have only one or two different interval sizes for each<br/>interval class. So if a scale is maximal even, it is also distributional<br/>even.<br/>The command FIT/MODE shows whether these properties exist for an equal<br/>temperament mode. For maximal evenness, the definition here is in one<br/>respect<br/>different than with SHOW DATA: the difference in step sizes may not be<br/>greater<br/>than 1. This is the original definition of John Clough. For distributional<br/>evenness, Clough&apos;s definition is not restricted to integer step size<br/>proportions, so there is no difference of definition there.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2004 8:20:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Manuel Op de Coul&quot; &lt;<a href="http://manuel.op.de">manuel.op.de</a>.<br/>coul@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve written this in the Scala tips.par file.
