Questions concerning tuning practices before 1750<br/>have been carefully explored over the last generation of scholarship,<br/>but tuning practices between about 1750 and the advent of recordings<br/>have received little serious scholarly attention. This gap is all the<br/>more puzzling, in that the core repertory of the Classical concert<br/>tradition was created in this period. Owen Jorgensen&apos;s two major works<br/>on historical piano tunings are core contributions to research into<br/>tuning practices prior to 1900, but after some two decades his research<br/>has still not been adequately discussed in the academic literature.&nbsp;</p><p>This colloquium will welcome a wide variety of approaches. Possible<br/>topics include:</p><p>Â– the comprehensiveness and reliability of existing research,<br/>including</p><p>Jorgensen&apos;s</p><p>Â– tuning practices in different instrument families, performance<br/>traditions, and</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; geographical regions</p><p>Â– patterns and tendencies of historical change in tuning practices</p><p>Â– ramifications of recent research into historical tunings for<br/>performance</p><p>practice, analysis, cognition, and aesthetics</p><p>Â– new avenues of research</p><p>Presenters are welcome to take part in both events, but are not required<br/>to do so.

Many American composers employing just intonation<br/>have focused on the beauty of just intonation, using lower-limit<br/>intervals and a limited group of notes, and have tended to adopt highly<br/>conservative aesthetic justifications for their work. In contrast,<br/>Johnston has throughout his career focused on the innovative potentials<br/>of just intonation: he has developed a sophisticated harmonic system<br/>allowing for an infinite number of notes and range of modulations, he<br/>has explored higher-limit and often highly dissonant intervals, and he<br/>has created a complex and original rhythmic language. This musical<br/>language has been developed not to exemplify mathematical relations, but<br/>rather for expressive ends, by a composer pondering issues of<br/>significance to himself and, he feels, to his society.</p><p>Until now, most research on Johnston has focused on explications of his<br/>tuning system, and relatively little in-depth analytical work has been<br/>done on his music. This colloquium in particular welcomes analyses of<br/>Johnston&apos;s music, discussions concerning Johnston&apos;s aesthetic goals and<br/>the degree of his success in realizing them, investigations of the<br/>relationship of Johnston&apos;s system to historical theoretical models (such<br/>as Riemann&apos;s O- and U-tonality), speculative papers concerning<br/>potentials for further development of just microtonality, and broader<br/>discussions of the goals and achievements of composers in this<br/>tradition. In addition, Johnston&apos;s notational approach opens interesting<br/>avenues for specifying variations in tuning that historical performance<br/>manuals have discussed, but for which no notation previously<br/>existed.&nbsp; Papers exploring the potential for performing older<br/>repertoire with the notational resources Johnston has developed are<br/>welcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Colloquium #2: Tuning Practices since 1750,</p><p>in Honor of Owen Jorgensen</p><p>&nbsp;March 13, 6-10 p.m.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the mid-20th century&apos;s seemingly most self-evident truisms<br/>concerning tuning was that equal temperament represented a high point of<br/>musical progress, a solution simultaneously rational, practical, and<br/>aesthetically pleasing after centuries&apos; worth of dissatisfaction with<br/>earlier temperaments.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a core assumption in J. Murray<br/>Barbour&apos;s seminal history of tuning practices, is central to the<br/>argument in important essays by the great musicologist Edward Lowinsky,<br/>and was an article of faith for the project of Modernist composers such<br/>as Stravinsky and Schoenberg.</p><p>Barbour, among others, assumed that performers since the Renaissance<br/>have commonly used equal temperament. One mark of the influence of such<br/>views is the fact that one still finds in introductory textbooks the<br/>claim that Bach&apos;s Well-tempered Clavier was actually intended for equal<br/>temperament, representing a milestone in the centuries-long struggle to<br/>overcome the imperfections of earlier tuning systems. These assumptions<br/>are still strong in our current culture: instrument design is still<br/>focused on removing deviations from equal temperament, professional<br/>musicians widely regard accurate performance in equal temperament as a<br/>mark of professionality, and&nbsp; generations of new-music performers<br/>have been trained to regard&nbsp; the assimilation of equal temperament as<br/>a sort of moral imperative,</p><p>Over the last generation, some aspects of what one could call the<br/>&quot;Equal-Tempered Project&quot; have begun to dissolve. Both the large volume<br/>of research on Medieval through Baroque tuning practices and the wealth<br/>of outstanding historically informed performances and recordings of this<br/>music have demonstrated the unreliability of equal-tempered biases,&nbsp;<br/>at least as regards the pre-Classical repertoire.&nbsp; In contrast to the<br/>situation in the mid-20th century, very few Baroque experts now would<br/>claim that performing Bach with equal temperament indicates a<br/>progressive, morally correct, or historically informed approach.&nbsp;</p><p>This sort of questioning of equal-tempered assumptions has, however, not<br/>yet been widely applied to Classical and Romantic music. The vast<br/>majority of performers consider the choice of equal temperament for this<br/>music to be self-evident, and few who question this premise have solid<br/>historical grounds for their choice.&nbsp; As one example, when expressive<br/>intonation is discussed, performers almost without exception assume the<br/>heightened leading tones advocated by Casals, whereas the mid-eighteenth<br/>century consensus overwhelmingly favored wide leading tones (diatonic<br/>semitones) and small augmented unisons (chromatic semitones), precisely<br/>the reverse of the current &quot;expressive intonation&quot; consensus.</p><p>Owen Jorgensen&apos;s two major works on historical piano tunings, Tuning the<br/>Historical Temperaments by Ear &nbsp;and Tuning, are core contributions to<br/>this debate, but after some two decades have still not been adequately<br/>discussed in the academic literature. Advocates such as Ross Duffin have<br/>treated his research as authoritative and ratified Jorgensen&apos;s assertion<br/>that true equal temperament was on a practical level not possible before<br/>the 20th century. Numerous musicologists and expert piano tuners,<br/>however, have questioned the reliability of Jorgensen&apos;s research and<br/>conclusions. What is missing is a thorough scholarly exploration of the<br/>issues Jorgensen has raised.&nbsp;&nbsp; If Jorgensen&apos;s research is reliable<br/>regarding the historical tunings of the piano, the central instrument of<br/>the 19th century, then there are important implications for both<br/>understanding and performing the music of this century.&nbsp; Perhaps the<br/>claims of Schumann and other composers to be able to identify specific<br/>key colors were not simply illusions, as has often been claimed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Perhaps the equal-tempered tuning currently used to perform Classical<br/>and Romantic music is not historically accurate.&nbsp; Most importantly,<br/>perhaps crucial expressive values in this music have been weakened or<br/>eliminated through the use of equal temperament (as has been<br/>demonstrated, for example with regard to the French clavecinistes of the<br/>Baroque period),</p><p>The Colloquium on Tuning Practices since 1750 will explore these and<br/>related issues.&nbsp; Possible topics include:</p><p>Â– the comprehensiveness and reliability of existing research,<br/>including</p><p>Jorgensen&apos;s</p><p>Â– tuning practices in different instrument families, performance<br/>traditions, and</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; geographical regions, including topics such as instrument<br/>design, historical performance manuals,&nbsp; and traditions of harmonic<br/>practice.</p><p>Â– patterns and tendencies of historical change in tuning practices,<br/>both prior to</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and during the era of recordings.</p><p>Â– ramifications of recent research into historical tunings for<br/>performance</p><p>practice, analysis, cognition, and aesthetics</p><p>Â– new avenues of research</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
