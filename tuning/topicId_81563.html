This will give a more<br/>complex underlying harmonic structure and chromatic melody.<br/>81/80 is not a normal melodic step in these 2 forms of modes.</p><p>When there is a modulation, and it is done in such a way that one note<br/>shifts by 81/80, there is a melody on the original note, which moves to<br/>another note (wether it is played or not) but not the 81/80, or better put<br/>it is no longer at the original note and it has the potential to move to<br/>many other notes according to the underlying harmonic structure, but not the<br/>old note shifted by 81/80.<br/>Yet, melody also has what I see as the ability to be made up of not 1<br/>melodic structure, but for one melody to stop sounding, and a completely new<br/>melody to start sounding and take over thesame melody spotlight as you could<br/>call it from the old melody so to continue as this melody.<br/>An easy to understand example of this is an &quot;echo&quot; to a melody. However<br/>these are still fairly distinguishable, it can be done much more subtle. One<br/>melody taking over from the other. I beleive it&apos;s found a lot in common<br/>music.<br/>Now this melody taking over from the other melody CAN be in the new location<br/>of the 81/80 shift.</p><p>So one can have a melody shifting by 81/80 (though it is in actuality 2<br/>different melodies, one taking over from the other).<br/>My theory is that this should still make sense (though only in the context<br/>of the modulation) and sound ok.<br/>I was wondering if there were examples of this where it sounds right and or<br/>where it sounds wrong.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=81586 href="#81586">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2009 1:28:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I understood you OK it shouldn&apos;t Marcel.</p><p>Claudio sorry, I misread your reply.<br/>I read it as should instead of shouldn&apos;t, which then didn&apos;t make sense with<br/>the rest of your reply so I thought you had misunderstood me :)<br/>But you did understand me right.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=81588 href="#81588">ðŸ”—</a>Claudio Di Veroli &#x3C;dvc@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2009 1:41:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I see, you mean to differentiate two melody levels one S.c. apart.<br/>Interesting it is.<br/>Not even Helmholtz in mid 19th c. was thinking along those lines, in spite<br/>of the fact that his famous 24-note JI harmonium would fit the two-levels<br/>very well.<br/>So it is definitely a modern idea.<br/>How good it is, I leave it to the experts in modern JI music.</p><p>Claudio</p><p>Marcel wrote:<br/>Claudio sorry, I misread your reply.<br/>I read it as should instead of shouldn&apos;t, which then didn&apos;t make sense with<br/>the rest of your reply so I thought you had misunderstood me :)<br/>But you did understand me right.</p><p>Yet, melody also has what I see as the ability to be made up of not 1<br/>melodic structure, but for one melody to stop sounding, and a completely new<br/>melody to start sounding and take over thesame melody spotlight as you could<br/>call it from the old melody so to continue as this melody</p></div><h3><a id=81592 href="#81592">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2009 2:23:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Claudio Di Veroli&quot; &lt;dvc@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see, you mean to differentiate two melody levels one S.c. apart.<br/>&gt; Interesting it is.</p><p>Not a modern idea at all.
