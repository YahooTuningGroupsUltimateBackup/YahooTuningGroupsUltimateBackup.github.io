Either compose (and perform) or improvise a piece that demonstrates the<br/>&gt; richness.<br/>&gt; &gt;2. Record the results.<br/>&gt; &gt;3. Post it on the web somewhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;It would be worth so much, maybe more than a _paper_.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Musically, all yours,<br/>&gt; &gt;Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wholeheartedly agree! For an improvisation, I would need a<br/>&gt; 27-tone-per-octave JI instrument, where the connections in the lattice<br/>&gt; diagram would be visible due to layout, coloration, or other means.<br/>&gt; Otherwise, I could attempt a composition and performance using my Ensoniq<br/>&gt; keyboard, but that would take some time. I&apos;d like to get around to it<br/>&gt; someday. Right now my musical efforts are focused on a new (but years in the<br/>&gt; making) band and we&apos;re writing and improvising in 12-equal at the moment.</p><p>Traitor.</p><p>&gt; Once we get off the ground, and I am confident that we will, 22-equal is<br/>&gt; around the corner, as two of the four of us have performed with it already<br/>&gt; (and a third is just the drummer :). It&apos;s too soon to say, but I wouldn&apos;t be<br/>&gt; surprised if we end up using other tuning systems as well, including<br/>&gt; non-equal ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Otherwise, I still feel my efforts to be of value. I posted that particular<br/>&gt; lattice because Joe Monzo had just asked me in an e-mail to draw some.<br/>&gt; Someone who likes lots of consonant 7-limit JI harmony might decide that<br/>&gt; they want to write a piece whose melodic resources divide the octave into<br/>&gt; three parts, with each of those divided into three parts, and each of those<br/>&gt; divided into three parts. Maybe they&apos;re reading this list and find what<br/>&gt; they&apos;re looking for. I know that several people on the list have been<br/>&gt; inspired by my original ideas about 22-equal to obtain or create, and play,<br/>&gt; instruments in that tuning; one in particular sent me e-mail after<br/>&gt; joy-filled e-mail as he proceeded to discover for himself the musical value<br/>&gt; of item after item in my paper.</p><p>I remember when I was in grade school and I had a problem<br/>with a teacher, my father would tell me &quot;those who can&apos;t, teach&quot;.</p><p>&gt; My 12-equal music also gives many people a lot of joy.</p><p>Wasted drunks in a bar digging a blues band?</p><p>&gt; I often get powerful,<br/>&gt; emotional responses from people and that is why I believe I am on the right<br/>&gt; path. I know that there is a lot of negative feeling toward me around here<br/>&gt; but I am really just trying to make people happy and make their lives<br/>&gt; richer. Sometimes I am argumentative or harsh but I believe that the truth<br/>&gt; will ultimately be more beneficial than misconceptions. Not that I always<br/>&gt; know the truth, or am always right, but I&apos;ve thought and listened hard and<br/>&gt; read widely on this stuff and sometimes I will have knowledge or a point of<br/>&gt; view to share. I&apos;m here to share and to learn. May we all do the same!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m off to perform (yes, plain old 12-equal guitar tonight). Let the flames<br/>&gt; begin!</p><p>and 90% of the list IS Paul....</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n  N e t  R a d i o<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
