I see 8 just 5:4s<br/>(386 cents), 4 are off by -7 cents (the &quot;spooky&quot; 7) and 2 are off by<br/>-21 cents.</p><p>Compared to 19-equal it seems to be &quot;better,&quot; since the number of<br/>just intervals is more than half... and in 19-equal ALL the 5:4s are,<br/>of course, 379 cents, all -7 low.</p><p>Of course, in a way it&apos;s kind of a &quot;toss up,&quot; since -7 is pretty<br/>close to just for each of the thirds.</p><p>Let&apos;s face it... it&apos;s a tie for the 5:4.</p><p>Let&apos;s be adventurous and try the 6:5 = 316 just:</p><p>In the 19-tone &quot;just&quot; scale:</p><p>316<br/>337<br/>316<br/>316<br/>302<br/>316<br/>316<br/>330<br/>316<br/>316<br/>302<br/>316<br/>316<br/>337<br/>316</p><p>OK... that&apos;s 10 just minor thirds, 2 are off by -14 cents and 2 are<br/>off by +21 cents.</p><p>HOWEVER, as we know, ALL the 6:5s in 19-tET are JUST:  316 cents!</p><p>So 19-tET is the big winner in the minor third category.</p><p>Mark your scorecards!</p><p>Let&apos;s spring for the 3:2 = 702 just.  That has to be useful somewhere<br/>down the road...</p><p>702<br/>716<br/>695<br/>702<br/>666<br/>702<br/>695<br/>716<br/>702</p><p>OK...  We&apos;ve got 4 just &quot;perfect&quot; fifths, 2 are off by +14 cents, 2<br/>are off by -7 cents and 1 is off by -35 cents...</p><p>In 19-tET all are 695, or off by -7 cents.</p><p>Pooh... looks like the just scale is a &quot;loser&quot; here...  I can hardly<br/>hear -7 cents!</p><p>Mark your scorecards!</p><p>I&apos;m feeling very Medieval at the moment, so let&apos;s look at the 4:3=<br/>498 just:</p><p>498<br/>519<br/>512<br/>519<br/>498<br/>498<br/>498<br/>498<br/>498<br/>519<br/>512<br/>519<br/>498</p><p>Hmmm.  6 just, 4 off +21 cents, 2 off +14 cents.  In 19-tET all are<br/>off -7 cents.  None really pure...</p><p>I think it&apos;s a tie here...</p><p>Please mark your scorecards...</p><p>Let&apos;s look at the 7:6= 267 just:</p><p>267<br/>267<br/>267<br/>253<br/>232<br/>253<br/>246<br/>267<br/>267<br/>246<br/>253<br/>232<br/>253<br/>267<br/>267<br/>267</p><p>Well, we have here 8 just 7:6s, 4 are off by -14 cents, 2 are off by<br/>+35 cents and 2 are off by +21 cents.</p><p>In 19-tET, all are off by -14 cents.</p><p>I think we have a winner here with the just scale!  Mark your<br/>scorecards!</p><p>I&apos;m feeling very 9:7= 435 just.  Let&apos;s try that kind of third.</p><p>435<br/>449<br/>449<br/>449<br/>435<br/>449<br/>428<br/>449<br/>435<br/>449<br/>435<br/>449<br/>449<br/>449<br/>435</p><p>Hmmm.  4 just, 8 off by +14 and 1 off by -7.</p><p>In 19-tET all are off by -7 cents.</p><p>With only 4 just, I would say that 19-tET is the &quot;winner&quot; here.  Mark<br/>your cards, please.</p><p>Lets go for the 5:3 = 884 cents just.</p><p>Well, I don&apos;t even have to post the results, since we know that the<br/>major sixth is JUST in 19-tET.</p><p>It&apos;s a clear &quot;winner&quot; in 19-tET....</p><p>Those are the most obvious intervals, but there are others:</p><p>52:18 = 568 just</p><p>and</p><p>36:25 = 632 just</p><p>For BOTH of these intervals, 19-tET differs from just NOT AT ALL, and<br/>transposes throughout the entire scale!</p><p>Well, let&apos;s look at our &quot;scorecard&quot; and rate the 9 interval choices<br/>we have made so far:</p><p>BETTER IN JUST SCALE??:  5:4 (a tie),  4:3 (a little debatable-- a<br/>tie) and 7:6</p><p>3 classes of intervals-- with two &quot;ties&quot;</p><p>BETTER (&quot;juster&quot;) in 19-tET:</p><p>6:5, 3:2, 9:7, 5:3, 25:18, 36:25...</p><p>6 intervals.</p><p>So, it seems that 19-tET produces MORE just intervals for 6 classes<br/>of intervals to the 3 classes of intervals for the &quot;just&quot; scale among<br/>the 9 basic classes selected...</p><p>Can it be that 19-tET is actually &quot;juster&quot; than just??</p><p>Of course, there is a &quot;downside.&quot;  The fact that, as a temperament<br/>the MAJORITY of intervals are &quot;off&quot;  (not the minor thirds and major<br/>sixes, though, nor the 25:18 and 36:25 intervals!)</p><p>Also, there is the &quot;cloying regularity&quot; of an equal temperament.<br/>That might, though, make it easy for performers to learn, but it<br/>seems so &quot;mechanical.&quot;  Little boxes... ugh.</p><p>ALSO, it doesn&apos;t correspond to such nice visual lattices... or at<br/>least corresponds only roughly.</p><p>HOWEVER, you&apos;ve got to admit that, in some quarters, it could be<br/>claimed that 19-tET is SUPERIOR from a JUST standpoint to this &quot;just&quot;<br/>scale we have been discussing.</p><p>Yes, no??</p><p>What did I do wrong in this study...???</p><p>thanks!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=21936 href="#21936">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>4/30/2001 9:13:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, let&apos;s look at our &quot;scorecard&quot; and rate the 9 interval choices<br/>&gt; we have made so far:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BETTER IN JUST SCALE??:  5:4 (a tie),  4:3 (a little debatable-- a<br/>&gt; tie) and 7:6<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3 classes of intervals-- with two &quot;ties&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BETTER (&quot;juster&quot;) in 19-tET:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6:5, 3:2, 9:7, 5:3, 25:18, 36:25...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6 intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, it seems that 19-tET produces MORE just intervals for 6 classes<br/>&gt; of intervals to the 3 classes of intervals for the &quot;just&quot; scale among<br/>&gt; the 9 basic classes selected...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can it be that 19-tET is actually &quot;juster&quot; than just??</p><p>First of all, you rigged the contest. 25:18 and 36:25 are such large-number intervals that<br/>you only ever could have been interested in because 19-tET approximates them so well<br/>(by stacking two of those just 6:5s).

Well, it&apos;s hard to beat those just minor thirds in 19-tET!</p><p>So our scorecard is now in favor of the just scaleÂ…. Of the 6<br/>intervals chosen for comparison, now 4 are superior in the just scale.</p><p>This is fortunate, since I have already set up the synthesizer for<br/>this scale, and have started composing in it!</p><p>Talk about &quot;skewing&quot; the results!</p><p>__________ _____ _ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=21954 href="#21954">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/1/2001 4:10:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_21931.html#21947">/tuning/topicId_21931.html#21947</a></p><p>Sorry... didn&apos;t mean to send TWO of these...  but I sent the first<br/>one very early in the afternoon and figured it somehow got lost...</p><p>The list was &quot;funky,&quot; obviously...</p><p>_______ ______ _____ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
