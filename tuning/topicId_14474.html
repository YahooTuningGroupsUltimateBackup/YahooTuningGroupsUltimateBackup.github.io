You have clarified some<br/>points about your original intentions in proposing your &quot;Other Noble<br/>Fifth&quot; tuning of which I, for one, will take due note in discussing<br/>the history of what is to me indeed a beautiful neo-Gothic tuning (or<br/>more properly &quot;temperament,&quot; as you point out, see below).</p><p>In music, as in the sciences, serendipity is often the name of the<br/>game: an experiment may have unpredictable results leading in new<br/>directions, not necessarily the ones intended by the original<br/>experimenter. This may be an especially notable, and humorous,<br/>example.</p><p>Please let me warmly agree that given your actual intentions in<br/>proposing this temperament, &quot;Keenan Pepper&apos;s neo-Gothic temperament&quot;<br/>is wrong; how about the rephrasing, &quot;Keenan&apos;s Pepper&apos;s proposed &apos;Noble<br/>Fifth&apos; temperament, which happens to be a beautiful and brilliant<br/>optimization from a neo-Gothic point of view&quot;?</p><p>By the way, your remark that you haven&apos;t _heard_ any neo-Gothic music<br/>reminds me that I should find or borrow a cassette recorder or the<br/>like and tape a few improvisations and medieval compositions; my<br/>cassette deck has been out of order for a couple of years, and it&apos;s<br/>time to repair or replace it. Then I could send you a tape, however<br/>&quot;quick and unpolished,&quot; of some actual music. (This goes for you and<br/>other Tuning List members, some with lots of experience and advice to<br/>offer, I&apos;d suspect.)</p><p>Your comment about &quot;temperaments,&quot; as opposed to &quot;tunings,&quot; leads me<br/>to consider how inconsistent my own usage is. Strictly speaking, the<br/>only &quot;regular tuning&quot; I&apos;ve used so far is Pythagorean; the others,<br/>including yours, are all &quot;regular temperaments.&quot; Informally, however,<br/>I often tend to use &quot;tuning&quot; as a generic category for everything.</p><p>Paleobiologists, for example, speak of _sensu strictu_ (&quot;in a strict<br/>sense&quot;) and _sensu latu_ (&quot;in a wider or freer sense&quot;), and maybe as a<br/>kind of musical evolutionary throwback to the 14th century, I can<br/>especially appreciate such distinctions.</p><p>Anyway, given your own musical agenda calling for ratios of 5 and 7,<br/>we are much agreed that &quot;Pepper&apos;s Noble Fifth&quot; is _not_ an especially<br/>likely tuning, any more than one would be likely to locate a tropical<br/>resort in the middle of Antarctica!</p><p>Seeing the allusion to &quot;hypermeantone&quot; in your original &quot;Other Noble<br/>Fifth&quot; post, I let myself guess that at least in a general sort of<br/>way, you may have intended it for neo-Gothic music, the main context<br/>on this List where &quot;hypermeantone&quot; has been discussed. However, as is<br/>often true, the actual story may be more remarkable than any legend.</p><p>For someone who seeks close approximations of ratios like 14:11 or<br/>21:17, it just happens that the 416-cent and 367-cent thirds of your<br/>tuning are ideal, and the balance of optimizatons between 14:11 and<br/>13:11 (or 33:28), and between 21:17 and 17:14, is quite remarkable.</p><p>When I first saw your proposal and checked out some of the intervals,<br/>my unabashed reaction was: &quot;I wish I had thought of this, but I&apos;m<br/>delighted that Keenan Pepper has.&quot; Both the idea of a temperament<br/>serving as a &quot;noble counterpart&quot; to Thorwald Kornerup&apos;s, and the<br/>wonderful _musical_ results, are indeed things of joy and beauty.</p><p>Now we know that it was serendipity, a serendipity best expressed in<br/>actual music.</p><p>Again, I want strongly to agree with you that if your agenda calls for<br/>ratios of 5 and 7, temperaments around 704 cents are not the likeliest<br/>choice. As Dave Keenan has noted in his brilliant paper on regular<br/>&quot;chain-of-fifths&quot; tunings, one ideal choice might be 1/4-comma<br/>meantone or 31-tET; a more &quot;offbeat&quot; choice might be 22-tET, much<br/>beloved by Paul Erlich.</p><p><a href="http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/1ChainOfFifthsTunings.htm">http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/1ChainOfFifthsTunings.htm</a></p><p>In theory, _any_ open tuning might approximate _any_ ratio to any<br/>desired degee of accuracy if the tuning chain is carried far enough.<br/>However, Dave very reasonably proposes 14 fifths or 15 notes per<br/>octave as one line to draw.</p><p>While it may be rash to judge a book by its cover, sampling the first<br/>15 or so notes of a tuning to get an idea of its general color and<br/>quality seems musically quite natural to me. If those notes don&apos;t fit<br/>a given style, then there is always the option Chaucer suggested to<br/>his readers: &quot;If you don&apos;t like this tale, choose another.&quot;</p><p>This isn&apos;t to exclude the very creative and ingenious tuning schemes<br/>and keyboard mappings of someone like Graham Breed, only to say that<br/>it isn&apos;t wrong to choose a tuning which makes the desired intervals<br/>available in the simplest and easiest way.</p><p>If the first 15 notes interest me, then certainly I may go to an<br/>archicembalo of 24, for example, and find additional &quot;surprises.&quot;<br/>However, with something like the e-based tuning I&apos;ve discussed<br/>recently (a neighbor to your &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning near the other end<br/>of the &quot;704-cent&quot; block), the first 12 or 15 notes are what attracted<br/>me to the neighborhood; the others are a kind of bonus.</p><p>It&apos;s both amusing and maybe educational that my passion for &quot;Keenan<br/>Pepper&apos;s Noble Fifth tuning&quot; should be something of an enigma to the<br/>author of that tuning himself.</p><p>Keenan, there&apos;s an old Latin saying which might apply, and which<br/>Thomas Morley invoked in 1597 to explain the taste of musicians given<br/>to a style of improvisation he considered &quot;old-fashioned&quot; and even<br/>crude: &quot;Such lips, such lettuce&quot; -- the quip of a certain M. Crassus,<br/>on seeing a donkey eat thistles.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
