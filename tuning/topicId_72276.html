My AP<br/>skills are of the sort that, if I&apos;m familiar with a popular tune<br/>through hearing it multiple times, I&apos;ll be able to play it in any<br/>key, even if I&apos;ve never played it before (come to think of it,<br/>shouldn&apos;t anyone with good relative pitch be able to do that?).</p><p>To avoid making this entirely OT, might I add that a generalized<br/>keyboard would, because of its transpositional invariance, eliminate<br/>many of the difficulties of transposing, improvising, or playing by<br/>ear for both AP and non-AP keyboardists, because one would be able to<br/>think almost entirely in terms of intervals and their associated key-<br/>patterns.</p><p>&gt; Unnerving in the same way that transposing a orchestral<br/>&gt; trumpet part for Bb trumpet is unnerving (until it becomes<br/>&gt; second-nature).  But not unnerving in any supernatural way.</p><p>With AP it&apos;s a little different than that.  If the instrument isn&apos;t<br/>producing the expected pitches, then I would have to translate the<br/>notes directly into physical actions and do my best to ignore the<br/>pitches being produced.  This is perhaps feasible for a transposed<br/>keyboard, but if I happen to be playing a transposing wind instrument<br/>(not hypothetical, since I&apos;ve played clarinet, trumpet, and French<br/>horn, each for a period of at least several years), I&apos;ll need to pay<br/>attention to my intonation.  I&apos;ve found that the best solution for a<br/>person with AP is *not* to transpose the pitches, but rather to learn<br/>to read a different *clef* at the same time one learns to play the<br/>instrument.  (This is particularly true with the French horn, which<br/>sounds a 5th lower than written.)  As a result, I&apos;ve learned to read<br/>5 different clefs fluently, and using the technique of translating<br/>notes to pitches to physical actions, I can sight-read a reasonably<br/>simple part (i.e., one that&apos;s not beyond my technical ability)<br/>written for one instrument on another instrument (or sight-sing it).</p><p>For example, on the French horn (in F, which parts I normally read in<br/>mezzo-soprano clef in C) I sight-read viola (alto clef in C) and<br/>trombone  (bass clef in C) parts with little difficulty the very<br/>first time I tried, and the first time I encountered a horn part in E-<br/>flat, I immediately sight-read it with no trouble at all as soon as I<br/>had figured out (after only a few seconds) that the pitches could be<br/>read in bass clef an octave higher, remembering to make adjustments<br/>for the key signature (which was quite obvious, since I could *hear*<br/>what key the piece was in; I knew another horn player with AP in Los<br/>Angeles who did it exactly the same way).</p><p>As you say, it becomes second-nature.  But for a musician with AP the<br/>mental process is a bit different than for one without.</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s a sensitive period for AP, but the skill can be<br/>&gt; refined with practice throughout one&apos;s life.</p><p>Very true.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=72305 href="#72305">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

(Does<br/>Deutsch<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; know this?) That is: at a minimum Kammerton and Tief Kammerton<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Chorton. Since Handel went to Italy and England he probably met<br/>one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or two more pitches there.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And this would effect their AP... how?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean their supposed or claimed AP - no circular arguments<br/>please.</p><p>Assuming AP, if the pitch difference is a semitone or more from<br/>previous experience, it would be quite disorienting the first time<br/>it&apos;s encountered (see my response to Carl).  If it&apos;s less than a<br/>quartertone, then there&apos;s not much problem.  It&apos;s analogous to seeing<br/>colors shifted (or blurred) along the color wheel.  A red that&apos;s<br/>somewhat orangy or purplish can still be accepted as &quot;red&quot;, but<br/>calling orange or purple &quot;red&quot; is more of a stretch.</p><p>&gt; Unless you have one single privileged pitch standard by which to<br/>&gt; identify and name notes, AP in anything like the modern sense is<br/>&gt; fairly meaningless. It could mean something if pitch standards<br/>&gt; differed by some whole number of semitones (with an inevitable fudge<br/>&gt; factor due to the uncertain size of semitone) - but what if there<br/>are<br/>&gt; also instruments with pitch &apos;in the cracks&apos;.</p><p>I would say that the opposite is true.  AP is developed from the<br/>ability to remember or &quot;play back&quot; in one&apos;s mind specific sounds<br/>(i.e., having specific pitches with specific timbres) heard multiple<br/>times.  If the pitches being heard are from more than one source,<br/>involving different timbres and possibly slightly different<br/>frequencies for the same &quot;key&quot; (as will inevitably be the case), then<br/>a given pitch-name may become somewhat generalized such that any<br/>pitch within a certain frequency range or cluster will be interpreted<br/>under that label.  This is analogous to the variations in color most<br/>of us accept for the labels &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;, or &quot;blue&quot;.  And (to<br/>keep this OT) if you&apos;re going microtonal or &quot;microcolor&quot;, then you&apos;ll<br/>need more pitch or color names.</p><p>&gt; George Secor put forward the idea that Bach and Handel, for some<br/>&gt; reason, would have been exposed to only one keyboard instrument<br/>with a<br/>&gt; fixed and stable pitch at the young age when AP may be acquired.<br/>That<br/>&gt; is highly debatable. The pitch of clavichords and harpsichords is<br/>&gt; unstable over periods longer than a few weeks.</p><p>That&apos;s plenty of time to start developing AP.  I specifically<br/>remember that I had already memorized &quot;A&quot; when I returned for my<br/>second music lesson (after only a week of study), and after that<br/>memorization of the rest of the natural notes came rapid-fire, almost<br/>automatically.  I didn&apos;t memorize the black keys until many months<br/>later, since I didn&apos;t have names for them.  I had gone for several<br/>months without lessons following 6 weeks of lessons in an<br/>introductory program offered by an accordion studio (yes, I developed<br/>AP with an accordion!).</p><p>The point is, once you&apos;ve started developing AP, the ability stays<br/>with you forever.  You can&apos;t turn it on and off, but you can sharpen<br/>(refine) it or dull (blur) it, depending on what you&apos;re subsequently<br/>exposed to.</p><p>&gt; The standard used to<br/>&gt; tune them would have been a pitch-pipe (no tuning forks yet!) which<br/>&gt; itself is unstable according to temperature, humidity etc. - as are<br/>&gt; organs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t exclude that Bach and many others could have had an ability<br/>&gt; *analogous* to people who today recognise pitches in the A=440 (or<br/>&gt; 438, Luciano!) equal-tempered scale - but it must have manifested<br/>&gt; itself in a rather different way, given the absence of stable pitch<br/>&gt; standard. Bach couldn&apos;t have said &apos;that&apos;s an A&apos;.</p><p>About your &quot;must have&quot; I must disagree.  I would think that the<br/>development of extreme AP acuteness would require a very stable pitch<br/>source.</p><p>I think it more likely that Bach and others would have categorized<br/>pitch-names cluster-fashion.  The piano and accordion in my home were<br/>probably somewhat different in pitch (since the piano was not tuned<br/>for years at a time), which would account for my tendency to identify<br/>pitches in this way.  When I was older I tested myself for pitch-<br/>range identification, and I discovered that I tolerated pitches tuned<br/>downward by a much greater amount than upward, probably because my<br/>piano, after years of not being tuned, had dropped somewhat in pitch.</p><p>This eventually motivated me to learn to tune a piano, which in turn<br/>led to my study of the reason for temperament, and that led to my<br/>investigation of microtonality.</p><p>&gt; More like (if he was<br/>&gt; really accurate!) &apos;that&apos;s an A in Cammerton a bit flatter than the<br/>old<br/>&gt; pitch-pipe my uncle used, in a cold winter&apos;.</p><p>That&apos;s possible, but I don&apos;t think he would have been talking about a<br/>difference of only 2 Hz (~8 cents).</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve read accounts of Bach and AP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good. Where, and what do they say? A lot of Bach stories are<br/>&gt; posthumous mythology.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And what is the evidence for Beethoven?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ... I&apos;m still asking.</p><p>Nothing I&apos;ve said provides any evidence *for* either of these.  I&apos;m<br/>only making the point that it&apos;s not highly unlikely.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; It is not down to tuning error differences in circulating<br/>&gt; &gt; temperaments, as is sometimes claimed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who says? I can cite you a source from France about 1700 which<br/>&gt; discusses this point and states the exact opposite. Namely, if you<br/>&gt; tune two harpsichords in the normal way, but one a semitone higher<br/>&gt; than the other, you find a very large difference in character when<br/>&gt; playing on one of them in C# major and on the other in C major,<br/>&gt; although the pitch of the keynotes may be the same.</p><p>Good point.</p><p>&gt; (And as if there weren&apos;t many, many other possible sources of key<br/>&gt; character in the peculiar characteristics of instruments and musical<br/>&gt; notation...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; More and better history please!</p><p>That&apos;s the bottom line!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=72307 href="#72307">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/12/2007 3:31:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>&gt; I haven&apos;t studied the paper yet, but I would like to make<br/>&gt; the analogy to color.

Bach (or of any European musician who started at or after the age<br/>of 4-5) acquiring AP was therefore less than 20%.</p><p>For non-tone-language musicians who didn&apos;t start until the age of 8 or<br/>9, the incidence of AP drops to zero!</p><p>The default (most likely) assumption for a musician who has a European<br/>language as mother tongue is that they do *not* have AP. It is only<br/>plausible for a minority of those who started training at an early age.</p><p>Statistical arguments can only go so far. With Mozart, the case is<br/>absolutely clear due to eye-witness accounts, and it is equally clear<br/>that he started playing the keyboard at an exceptionally young age - 3<br/>or 4, precisely what you would expect from Deutsch&apos;s theory for<br/>someone most likely to develop AP in Western culture. But prior to<br/>1750 the trail seems pretty cold.</p><p>Beware of assuming that the Great Man&apos;s musical experience must have<br/>been rather like your own...</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=72328 href="#72328">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>7/13/2007 11:34:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl: Actually I&apos;m aware of two university  studies that demonstrated<br/>acquisition of AP skills by college-age people in  some<br/>of participants.</p><p>Johnny: This sounds like people who had the necessary  predisposition for AP,<br/>but needed it to be awakened.</p><p>How would you explain why George Ives had AP, but Charles  Ives did not.<br/>Surely, Charles had all the musical advantages of his father  to &quot;learn the<br/>skill.&quot;</p><p>Carl:  It&apos;s rather like language, really.

So little hope<br/>&gt; &gt; yet with pitch per se, as opposed to hearing an instrument&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; own quirks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To me, Eb sounds &apos;hollow&apos; or &apos;nasal&apos; and F# sounds shrill<br/>&gt; or bright.  Works on every piano in the middle three octaves,<br/>&gt; and I can identify them cold based on this.  I had C and A<br/>&gt; at some point too, but I lost them some years back I think.<br/>&gt; I should try it again.<br/>&gt;</p><p>No need for me to go all that way, Carl.

The necessity<br/>of occasionally having to think in two different keys at once (e.g.,<br/>when the choir I was singing in suddenly, for no apparent reason,<br/>dropped the pitch a half-step) motivated me to improve my relative<br/>pitch skills.</p><p>These problems are far outweighed by the advantages, e.g., the<br/>ability to jump in with an accompaniment for a song leader who<br/>(taking full advantage of my AP) started singing something in a key<br/>literally &quot;pulled out of the air&quot; (which, BTW, was *hardly ever* the<br/>original key).  Sometimes I play the trumpet (a B-flat instrument, by<br/>ear) with a group that likes to play in keys best suited to the<br/>guitar, and the experience has caused me to become comfortable<br/>playing in keys with a lot of sharps.</p><p>AP can present challenges, but it also presents opportunities to grow.</p><p>&gt; this whole discussion is<br/>&gt; pretty amusing. And the whole topic is even funnier when I consider<br/>&gt; one of my brothers, who is a kind of &quot;savant&quot;, busting out with some<br/>&gt; downright creepy demonstrations of musical prowess (entire operatic<br/>&gt; scenes heard one time in perfect pitch and time and so on) when<br/>he&apos;s<br/>&gt; not busy working on his &quot;good relationships with insects&quot; and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pfffft, forget it and go make music.</p><p>Yes, I agree that&apos;s good advice if you don&apos;t already have it.

It&apos;s possible<br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; where I live and work makes me too sensitive to this (just did a<br/>&gt; &gt; concert in Belgrade) but I really feel it&apos;s true for all humans:<br/>&gt; &gt; one man&apos;s &quot;blue&quot; might be another man&apos;s &quot;green&quot; so it&apos;s best just<br/>&gt; &gt; to hear and create as &quot;true&quot; as you can and let a Higher<br/>&gt;authority<br/>&gt; &gt; judge what&apos;s really &quot;absolute&quot;, trusting that we&apos;re all tied in<br/>&gt;an<br/>&gt; &gt; absolute whether we know it or not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It sounds as if you&apos;ve had to contend with varying pitch standards.</p><p>Thankfully, yes- it seems a shame to establish any kind<br/>of fixed hierarchy in the sound continuum. Probably a major step<br/>toward liberation came from first day singing Baroque at A-415<br/>without having been told anything about the tuning (wait a sec...<br/>am I crazy, aren&apos;t we singing everything a semitone down? and so<br/>much more natural sounding!)</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m wondering whether Bach or Handel might have felt this way if<br/>&gt;they<br/>&gt; had developed AP at an early age and subsequently discovered that<br/>&gt; there were multiple (contradictory) pitch standards.  They would<br/>&gt; probably have been loath to discuss it (in which case, we&apos;ll never<br/>&gt; know).</p><p>I&apos;m afraid that the typical human reaction is to consider the<br/>familiar the &quot;real&quot;. Not that Bach would necessarily have typical<br/>reactions of course.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now Johnnny may insist that his solo bassoon work is performend<br/>&gt; &gt; without AP, but noone and no thing can sail by dead-reckoning<br/>&gt;&gt;like<br/>&gt; &gt; that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does a very highly developed sense of relative pitch count for<br/>&gt; nothing?</p><p>Counts immensely, I wish mine were much better than it is, but I<br/>can hear that &quot;thing&quot; of the... embracing support? structural field?<br/>I don&apos;t know what to call it. If the intonational cohesiveness of<br/>the solo piece of Johnny Rheinhard&apos;s I listened to recently was<br/>achieved without a subconcious absolute reference, I would<br/>consider Rheinhard&apos;s relative pitch more than &quot;highly developed&quot;,<br/>rather &quot;phenomenal&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s obvious that there&apos;s a &quot;global&quot; picture involved, and that<br/>&gt; &gt; is true AP without the social elements. And Carl, don&apos;t try to<br/>sell<br/>&gt; &gt; me bananas. When Aaron posted his listening test a couple of<br/>months<br/>&gt; &gt; ago, do you really tink that you heard those difference by<br/>counting<br/>&gt; &gt; beats and shit like that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t have to count beats to hear qualitative differences<br/>(faster<br/>&gt; or slower) in beat rates, just as you don&apos;t need AP to tell<br/>whether<br/>&gt; one pitch is higher or lower than another.</p><p>Yes but how fine can the differences be?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Give me a break, your heard those tiny<br/>&gt; &gt; differences in the<br/>&gt; &gt; context of an overarching &quot;absolute&quot;, the same as I did.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It depends on what you mean by this.  If you mean that many of us<br/>on<br/>&gt; this list are sufficiently familiar with the characteristic sound<br/>of<br/>&gt; triads in 12-ET that we can use that as an internalized &quot;absolute&quot;<br/>&gt; reference against which we can make qualitative comparisons of<br/>&gt;other<br/>&gt; triads tempered by different amounts (e.g., slightly better than<br/>&gt;12-<br/>&gt; ET or somewhat worse than 12-ET), then that&apos;s a kind of &quot;tonal<br/>&gt; memory&quot; (similar to being able to distinguish one timbre from<br/>&gt; another), but it&apos;s not the same thing as AP.</p><p>Don&apos;t mean that- in the test I was referring to, it was two<br/>non-12-tET higher-ratio thirds less than two cents apart. I<br/>seriously doubt that referencing them against 12-tET alone could<br/>suffice. It seems to me that people naturally reference against<br/>much finer &quot;absolutes&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Likewise, the ability to distinguish between a just, 12-ET, and<br/>&gt; pythagorean major 3rd with the tones played *consecutively* is not<br/>&gt; AP, but a refined sense of relative pitch (which I&apos;m sure many on<br/>&gt; this list have developed).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As someone with born &quot;AP&quot; who has spent a decade at least<br/>getting<br/>&gt; &gt; rid of it, at least on a conscious level,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How tragic!

The Dutch 31-tone<br/>&gt; movement used A=440, and 31-ET was also set at A=440 in the 3<br/>&gt; Scalatrons made with generalized keyboards in the 1970&apos;s, so there&apos;s<br/>&gt; ample precedent to stick with that.</p><p>I agree; that&apos;s the tuning I use already.

(Otherwise you would have to<br/>&gt; make relative-pitch comparisons with the nearest 12-ET pitches in<br/>&gt; your head, which isn&apos;t AP in the strictest sense.)  In my most recent<br/>&gt; answer to Carl (msg. #72411) I make mention of a &quot;simpler, more<br/>&gt; passive, and less structured&quot; (and relatively painless) method of<br/>&gt; developing AP that&apos;s readily adaptable to microtonality; if you<br/>&gt; already have AP with reference to 12-ET, then it&apos;s a sure thing.</p><p>I still have think of everything in terms of 12 or 24. I&apos;d probably be better at 72-ET than 31-ET.</p><p>&gt; 3) There would be a very limited market for a 31-tone test, so we&apos;re<br/>&gt; not likely to see one any time soon.</p><p>That sort of program would have to test and train for a variety of tunings, and of course be able to load .scl and .tun files. It would be a pretty simple program, as long as you have a MIDI synth that can execute pitch bends.</p><p>Come to think of it, I&apos;d like to see an ear-training function in Scala. (You reading, Manuel?)</p><p>&gt; However, you did manage to get this thread back on topic. :-)</p><p>There was a discussion of absolute/perfect pitch; I just had to jump in. It might be that people with AP are more likely to have an interest in tuning issues. We surely have a few more list members yet to come out of the woodwork.</p><p>~D.</p></div><h3><a id=72436 href="#72436">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2007 6:13:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; As discussed, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any meaning in stating<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that someone is born with AP.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I suspect that everyone&apos;s born with AP actually, or goes through<br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt; at a certain stage as an infant (the direct mimicing stage, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; very cute as you know).

As I was working on my<br/>reply and revisiting my own early childhood experiences, I not only<br/>remembered seemingly insignificant details, but also came to the<br/>realization that a couple of those details seem to have been<br/>extremely important to my success in developing AP as easily as I<br/>did.  The more I write, the more thoughts I have left to write.  It&apos;s<br/>very similar to what happened with the &quot;avalanche of ideas&quot; that went<br/>through my mind when Margo Schulter wrote me about my 17-tone well-<br/>temperament in September 2001.   It&apos;s curious that you mentioned the<br/>paper that came out of that; perhaps I&apos;ll end up writing one about<br/>absolute pitch and microtonality.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m not quite done writing my reply to Carl (hang in there!),<br/>and I hope you&apos;ll think it was worth waiting for.</p><p>&gt; Some time ago I specifically mentioned your 17-WT<br/>&gt; as audibly having what I call a cohesive character (it&apos;s of &quot;one<br/>&gt; pallette&quot; so to speak) and I now wonder if your &quot;kinder gentler<br/>micro-<br/>&gt; friendly AP&quot; is actually the same thing I was talking about when<br/>&gt; disparaging &quot;A-440 12-tET AP&quot; and saying that a deep and all-<br/>embracing<br/>&gt; version is the true ideal.</p><p>If I&apos;m interpreting what you&apos;re saying correctly, then the &quot;simpler,<br/>more passive, and less structured&quot; method I refer to above doesn&apos;t<br/>directly address what you&apos;re looking.  What I have at the moment is a<br/>specific approach or tactic (based on past experience) for the person<br/>with 12-ET-based AP to make new pitch-associations outside of the 12-<br/>ET set, without specifying what those pitches might be.  (I won&apos;t<br/>elaborate on that here, because I expect to include something about<br/>that in my reply to Carl.)</p><p>Something that approach or tactic doesn&apos;t address, however, is how to<br/>cope with some of the seemingly contradictory things that you come<br/>across when you&apos;re into multiple tunings, e.g., sharps and flats<br/>equivalent in 12-ET may be higher or lower than one another in other<br/>tunings, and pitch standards are yet another issue.  The essence of<br/>the problem is that you run into trouble if you want to tie a pitch<br/>name down to one particular pitch, or put another way, confusion<br/>results when you attempt to use the same name for two significantly<br/>different pitches.</p><p>If I had to give you a quick and easy solution off the top of my<br/>head, then here it is.  (Danny Wier, take note!)  You could simply<br/>settle on tackling the pitches of 72-ET, but you&apos;ll need reasonably<br/>short names for them.  For names, I&apos;d suggest the modifiers 5-up, 5-<br/>down, 7-up, 7-down, 11-up, and 11-down (for +1, -1, +2, -2, +3, and -<br/>3 degrees of 72, respectively) to correspond to the prime-number<br/>(harmonic) modifications indicated by the accidentals required for 72-<br/>ET.  One nice thing about this is that it would enable you to<br/>integrate 6 separate pitch-standards for 12-ET into a single grand<br/>scheme, since 72-ET consists of 6 chains (or circles) of 12 fifths.</p><p>However, settling on a 72-ET framework, good as it is, has the<br/>disadvantage of making it difficult to integrate other excellent<br/>tunings into your frame of reference -- but it&apos;s not impossible.  For<br/>example, I thought of a way to integrate 31-ET into 72.  Start with<br/>A=440 and construct a chain of 15 additional pitches in each<br/>direction from A using a Miracle generator (or &quot;secor&quot; :-), for a<br/>total of 31 pitches (i.e., Canasta).  In 72-ET a secor is ~116.67c,<br/>while in 31-ET it&apos;s ~116.13c, a difference of ~0.54c.  Over the<br/>extent of 15 secors in either direction this accumulates to slightly<br/>over +/-8 cents maximum difference at the very worst.  Since 1deg72<br/>is ~16.67c, that&apos;s still less than half of that, so you have all of<br/>the pitches of 31-ET (organized in a single chain) to within the<br/>nearest degree of 72-ET.  If you can tolerate a difference of up to 8<br/>cents for a given pitch-name, you&apos;re in business!</p><p>If you wish, you could then convert the 72-ET names into 31-ET names<br/>(using the prefixes semi- and sesqui- with the sharp and flat word<br/>roots to translate them into 31 notation), but it wouldn&apos;t be<br/>necessary to think of them that way.</p><p>Does this help at all?</p><p>&gt; By the way, where&apos;s your 34-tone paper?</p><p>Not yet a reality, but some day soon, I hope.  I started writing a<br/>book on microtonality around seven or eight years ago.  I completed<br/>an introduction and about 10 chapters, but much of it would have to<br/>be rewritten, since so much has taken place since then.

The 4:5:6:7:9:11 chord on C, for example, I could spell out<br/>as C E- G<br/>&gt; Bdb+ D F&acirc;Â€&iexcl; (&acirc;Â€&iexcl; = half-sharp, d = half-flat, + = one 72-edo comma<br/>up, - = one<br/>&gt; comma down). Reading that out, I could say &quot;C, E down, G, B flat-<br/>and-a-half<br/>&gt; up, D, F half-sharp&quot;.</p><p>Not bad.  You could simplify &quot;flat-and-a-half&quot; by using &quot;sesquiflat&quot;,<br/>and &quot;half-sharp&quot; would then become &quot;semisharp&quot;.  I&apos;m thinking that<br/>there could be even simpler (much shorter) names and already have an<br/>idea of how to go about it, but I&apos;ll have to give it a lot more<br/>thought before I say anything more.</p><p>&gt; But I&apos;m not all *that* precise in determining pitches at that level<br/>of<br/>&gt; precision. Does anybody have AP with comma-level accuracy?</p><p>If so, it would most likely be someone associated with the Boston<br/>Microtonal Society.  Personally, I can&apos;t see investing the time &amp;<br/>effort to develop AP that fine, especially since I&apos;ve never used 72-<br/>ET (and don&apos;t expect to) for anything more than an brief example.</p><p>Now 31-ET is a different story.  I&apos;ve used that a lot on my Scalatron<br/>over the years, so I&apos;ve already internalized its pitches to some<br/>extent.  Shortly after getting the instrument, I quickly noticed<br/>differences in pitch-color between pairs of sharps and flats that are<br/>equivalent in 12-ET.  (Curiously, the flats, though higher in pitch<br/>than the adjacent sharps, seem to have what I would call a &quot;mellower&quot;<br/>quality.)</p><p>I may try listening experiments with the 31 pitches out of 72 that<br/>are closest to 31-ET.</p><p>&gt; (Note: the &acirc;Â€&iexcl; symbol, which might not come through in your e-mail,<br/>is the<br/>&gt; double dagger; I use it for half-sharp. In Windows is typed<br/>Alt+0135; its<br/>&gt; Unicode location is U+2021.)</p><p>It didn&apos;t come out right, but I know what you mean.</p><p>&gt; &gt; However, settling on a 72-ET framework, good as it is, has the<br/>&gt; &gt; disadvantage of making it difficult to integrate other excellent<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings into your frame of reference -- but it&apos;s not impossible.<br/>For<br/>&gt; &gt; example, I thought of a way to integrate 31-ET into 72.  Start<br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; A=440 and construct a chain of 15 additional pitches in each<br/>&gt; &gt; direction from A using a Miracle generator (or &quot;secor&quot; :-), for a<br/>&gt; &gt; total of 31 pitches (i.e., Canasta).  In 72-ET a secor is<br/>~116.67c,<br/>&gt; &gt; while in 31-ET it&apos;s ~116.13c, a difference of ~0.54c.  Over the<br/>&gt; &gt; extent of 15 secors in either direction this accumulates to<br/>slightly<br/>&gt; &gt; over +/-8 cents maximum difference at the very worst.  Since<br/>1deg72<br/>&gt; &gt; is ~16.67c, that&apos;s still less than half of that, so you have all<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; the pitches of 31-ET (organized in a single chain) to within the<br/>&gt; &gt; nearest degree of 72-ET.  If you can tolerate a difference of up<br/>to 8<br/>&gt; &gt; cents for a given pitch-name, you&apos;re in business!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been working on incorporating 31-et into 72-et, and I do use<br/>MIRACLE.<br/>&gt; What I do is start with the 41-tone &quot;studloco&quot; subset. I then put<br/>31-et<br/>&gt; names on top of those, with two 41-tone pitches one 72-edo degree<br/>apart<br/>&gt; getting the same name.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0: C<br/>&gt; 1:<br/>&gt; 2: Dbb (C&acirc;Â€&iexcl;)<br/>&gt; 3:<br/>&gt; 4: C# (Ddb)<br/>&gt; 5: C# (Ddb)<br/>&gt; 6:<br/>&gt; 7: Db (C&acirc;Â€&iexcl;#)<br/>&gt; 8:<br/>&gt; 9: Cx (Dd)<br/>&gt; 10:<br/>&gt; 11: D<br/>&gt; 12: D<br/>&gt; 13<br/>&gt; 14: Edd (D&acirc;Â€&iexcl;)<br/>&gt; 15<br/>&gt; 16: D# (Edb)<br/>&gt; 17<br/>&gt; 18: Eb (D&acirc;Â€&iexcl;#)<br/>&gt; 19: Eb (D&acirc;Â€&iexcl;#)<br/>&gt; (no need to do the whole octave)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since sizes of sharps and flats and their doubles, halves and and-a-<br/>halves<br/>&gt; would vary in size, there might be problems with this method, this<br/>would at<br/>&gt; least reflect actual musical practice, sparing us the use of &quot;comma<br/>up&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;comma down&quot; for that 4:5:6:7:9:11 chord, which then would simply<br/>be called<br/>&gt; C-E-G-Bdb-D-F&acirc;Â€&iexcl;.</p><p>That&apos;s liable to lead you down the pitfalls of a Ben Johnston-type of<br/>nomenclature that is best avoided.  Let me show you how I&apos;d do it.</p><p>For now, I&apos;m ignoring the problem of finding simple spoken names for<br/>the pitches and instead am focusing on a simple way to write them<br/>down.  Using Sagittal shorthand, the characters representing Sagittal<br/>symbols for alterations to the natural notes of 72-ET are shown in<br/>the first 3 rows of the following table:</p><p>deg72: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12<br/>   up: /  f  ^  #t #\ #  #/ #f #^ xt  x\  x<br/> down: \  t  v  bf b/ b  b\ bt bv bbf bb/ bb<br/>deg31: 0  1  1  1  2  2  2  3  3  3   4   4<br/>             1        2        3          4</p><p>(To view this properly, click on &quot;Show Message Option&quot; at the top of<br/>the gray area to the right of this message, and then click on &quot;Use<br/>Fixed Width Font&quot;.)</p><p>The characters (and Sagittal symbols they represent) are symbolizing<br/>prime-number alterations (specifically the commas 80:81, 63:64, and<br/>32:33) valid for 1, 2, and 3deg72, but since they&apos;re defined as<br/>rational comma-alterations rather than specific degrees of 72, they<br/>also have validity and meaning in other octave divisions (as do the<br/>sharp and flat symbols, which are defined as alterations of an<br/>apotome, 2048:2187).  For 31-ET, these characters represent the<br/>number of degrees of 31 indicated in row 4 of the table, and row 5<br/>shows you which characters are used to notate 31-ET.</p><p>Since 80:81 (the 5-comma) vanishes in 31-ET, the \ / symbol pair<br/>equates to 0deg31, i.e., it has no effect on the pitch; so if you&apos;re<br/>in 31-ET and read E\ of C/, you&apos;ll ignore the 5-comma alterations and<br/>think of them as E and C, respectively.</p><p>Likewise, since the 63:64 (7-comma) and 32:33 (11-diesis) both<br/>correspond to 1deg31, if you have a 7-comma alteration in the 72-ET<br/>name, in 31-ET you can think of it as equivalent to an 11-diesis<br/>alteration and can mentally convert the t f character pair to v ^.</p><p>Here&apos;s how the tones of Canasta, centered on A=440, are notated in<br/>both 72 and 31-ET:</p><p>72: Df Ev Ft F#\ G Ab/ Af Bv Ct C#\ D Eb/ Ef F^ Gt G#\<br/>31: D^ Ev Fv F#  G Ab  A^ Bv Cv C#  D Eb  E^ F^ Gv G#</p><p>72: A Bb/ Bf C^ Dt D#\ E F/ Gbf G^ At A#\ B C/ Dbf D^<br/>31: A Bb  B^ C^ Dv D#  E F  Gb  G^ Av A#  B C  Db  D^</p><p>Notice that the 72-to-31 character conversions work perfectly!</p><p>There are also other spellings in both 72 and 31, for example, the<br/>harmonic 7th of C/ in 72 (alias C in 31) is Bb\ in 72, which should<br/>be Bbv in 31.  Simply dropping the \ when translating from 72 to 31<br/>isn&apos;t guaranteed to work with alternate spellings (due to the fact<br/>that A# and Bb are equivalent in 72, but not in 31), so you&apos;ll have<br/>stick with to translating the written names given in the above<br/>listing, so that A#\ in 72 becomes A# in 31, which you then convert<br/>to Bbv (or Bdb).</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve started practicing 72-edo on my Oriental keyboard, which has<br/>twelve<br/>&gt; scale tuning buttons - when turned off, they leave the keyboard in<br/>12-et,<br/>&gt; but when one is turned on, it raises or lowers one note in the<br/>octave up to<br/>&gt; 64 cents (by default, it lowers it by 50, since the instrument is<br/>designed<br/>&gt; for modern Arabic music, but that can be changed for each of the<br/>pitches).<br/>&gt; There are three memory buttons as well.</p><p>Sounds good to me!  In my experience all you need to do is play<br/>around with the pitches, and you&apos;ll automatically remember some of<br/>the things you&apos;re hearing, particularly if you play them over again<br/>at least several times (but don&apos;t try to cover too much at one time).</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=72533 href="#72533">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

The essence<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; the problem is that you run into trouble if you want to tie a<br/>&gt;pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; name down to one particular pitch, or put another way, confusion<br/>&gt; &gt; results when you attempt to use the same name for two<br/>significantly<br/>&gt; &gt; different pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the rub- I get tangled up in solfeggio (ma, me, mo, mi mu,<br/>&gt; LOL )already in 34, which is the realistic and practical point of<br/>&gt; reference for me.</p><p>Ha ha!

Were the 3 hours of training all in one day in a<br/>special facility, or did you do it by yourself at home?  Did you<br/>actually learn to identify each of these two pitches cold, i.e.,<br/>hearing only one of them without hearing the other one first in a<br/>session?  Are you still able to do now what you did at the end of the<br/>3 hours?  Why didn&apos;t you go any farther?</p><p>&gt; &gt; In order to distinguish middle C from the C an octave lower or<br/>&gt; &gt; higher, it&apos;s necessary to use information other than an impression<br/>&gt; &gt; of the &quot;pitch-color&quot; perceived by persons with AP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Fortunately, an octave separation between tones is sufficient<br/>&gt; &gt; to distinguish one from the other using the rough sense of<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch-height that all musicians possess:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; let&apos;s try that in<br/>&gt; &gt; a subsequent session with the tones a major 7th apart, then a<br/>&gt; &gt; minor 7th, then a major 6th, etc., making the distance<br/>&gt; &gt; progressively smaller.</p><p>Now that I think about it, this method may actually be useful for<br/>developing AP, because it keeps one (and only one) pitch constant<br/>within a varying context, so you may actually learn to recognize its<br/>pitch-color through many repetitions.  (But that&apos;s just an &quot;aside&quot;.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; You&apos;ll soon reach a point where your<br/>&gt; &gt; rough sense of pitch-height is not up to the task, and I<br/>&gt; &gt; suspect that may occur somewhere in the vicinity of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;moderate successs&quot; to which you refer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, I was using pitch color, not pitch height.  And the<br/>&gt; studies had people getting all 12 pitches.</p><p>So there was some success, then.  I&apos;m wondering why there&apos;s so much<br/>bad press to the contrary.  Perhaps some of these courses are not as<br/>good as the one you took.</p><p>&gt; &gt; For a more informed opinion, search for the two occurrences<br/>&gt; &gt; of &quot;waste&quot; in the following:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.jackgrassel.com/pages/perfect_pitch.html">http://www.jackgrassel.com/pages/perfect_pitch.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first occurrence implies you can&apos;t study both RP and AP.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it was meant to, or if it was, that you can&apos;t study<br/>both at the same time.  The point was that improving one&apos;s relative<br/>pitch is not only possible (regardless of one&apos;s age), but it&apos;s also<br/>well worth the time and effort, with none of the drawbacks of AP.<br/>Not only do I agree wholehearted with this, but I also believe that<br/>AP is not a substitute for RP and that any musician with AP should<br/>also work on RP.</p><p>&gt; The second discusses 350 hours of learning to distinguish<br/>&gt; two notes.  I don&apos;t believe *anyone* would have the patience<br/>&gt; to work on two notes for that long to achieve success.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t say exactly what they worked on or how they worked on it,<br/>only that the results weren&apos;t any better than that.  I would have to<br/>agree that if this was the case, it was a colossal waste of time.</p><p>&gt; He<br/>&gt; also mentions some guy wandering around with a tuning fork<br/>&gt; for a year.  I did that for a month in 1994, and I discovered<br/>&gt; that this can never work to train AP.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>&gt; You don&apos;t know what<br/>&gt; to listen for without comparing tones.</p><p>Yes.  It&apos;s like observing the differences in timbre between a<br/>clarinet, oboe, trumpet, and violin.  You more easily perceive the<br/>characteristic sound of each one of these by comparing it with the<br/>others.</p><p>&gt; And trying to<br/>&gt; &quot;memorize&quot; isn&apos;t going to get you anywhere.</p><p>That&apos;s rather mystical, but yes, I agree!  Following my analogy<br/>above, the first time you hear the timbre of a clarinet or oboe in a<br/>music appreciation course, you don&apos;t have to try to memorize it,<br/>because that comes automatically after listening to it once or<br/>twice.  Of course, you&apos;ll need to remember the name of the instrument<br/>producing the sound, but what you&apos;re memorizing is really the *name*<br/>of the sound rather than sound itself.</p><p>One problem that must be dealt with in AP training, however, is that<br/>the tones being compared differ not only in pitch-color but also in<br/>pitch-height, so it would be helpful to present sounds in a way that<br/>would enhance one&apos;s perception of the former while inhibiting that of<br/>the latter.  As you&apos;ll see below, this was in fact accomplished very<br/>elegantly, and completely by chance, in my own experience of<br/>acquiring AP.</p><p>&gt; Since only 12<br/>&gt; things are involved, if it were a question of memory and<br/>&gt; exposure, lots more people would have AP.</p><p>I found that I didn&apos;t have to *try* to memorize pitch-colors, because<br/>the differences were fairly obvious (is it that young children<br/>naturally hear things differently?).  The only memorization I had to<br/>do was to associate the pitch-colors with their names, so it was<br/>indeed the *names* I was memorizing.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks. I think a note-naming game will be sufficient,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Contrary to what you might think, I have good reason to believe<br/>&gt; &gt; that it might *not* be the best way,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First off, wouldn&apos;t you say that Weiger&apos;s method is a &quot;simple<br/>&gt; note-naming game&quot;?</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s necessarily simple.  I didn&apos;t say it wouldn&apos;t work, only<br/>that I didn&apos;t think it was necessarily the best way -- at least by<br/>itself.  As you&apos;ll see below, I think that it helps if this sort of<br/>activity is preceded by other, less structured, experiences in which<br/>music and/or musical pitches are absorbed and internalized in a way<br/>that literally sets the child up for success in the game.  These<br/>kinds of activities can be provided at an earlier age than might be<br/>appropriate for a note-naming game, because they allow the child to<br/>have fun on his/her own terms and also avoid putting pressure on the<br/>child to &quot;perform&quot; in a predetermined manner in order to produce<br/>certain expected results.</p><p>&gt; &gt; but I must have done something right to have come by<br/>&gt; &gt; it almost effortlessly -- and I believe I&apos;ve figured it out!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, spill the beans then.  That&apos;s the 2nd time I&apos;ve asked,<br/>&gt; despite my editing-out.</p><p>Okay, sorry, but I couldn&apos;t put it in a short reply.  It&apos;s going to<br/>require a mini-essay, which I&apos;m having to write in bits and pieces.<br/>I&apos;m going to supply many details, because even seemingly<br/>insignificant details can provide very important clues about the<br/>process.  It&apos;s possible that others reading this may pick up on<br/>things that I&apos;ve missed, so I&apos;m sharing this in the hope that we may<br/>all learn something from it.</p><p>First, I need to relate several things not a part of my formal<br/>musical training that I believe prepared me for AP development:</p><p>1) I began music lessons at age 6, but in the couple of years prior<br/>to that I enjoyed listening to phonograph records (that&apos;s what we<br/>called those 78 rpm disks back in the forties).  In the course of a<br/>couple of years I had listened to my favorite ones countless times,<br/>and the sounds in vivid detail (including the pitches) became fixed<br/>in my memory.  My #1 favorite was the opening section of the first<br/>movement of Tchaikovsky&apos;s first piano concerto.  It wasn&apos;t until<br/>years later that I was surprised to learn, hearing a pop recording on<br/>the radio that I had listened to only days before on the phonograph,<br/>that the turntable was rotating too fast, transposing everything up<br/>roughly a semitone.  The Tchaikovsky that I first heard in D major<br/>was supposed to be in D-flat!  Likewise, &quot;Waltz of the Flowers&quot; from<br/>the Nutcracker, which I thought was in E-flat, was actually in D!<br/>Fortunately, this did not take place at the time I was memorizing<br/>note names.</p><p>2) I began kindergarten at the age of 4 years, 10 months (beating the<br/>deadline by only 3 days), and I recall one song that semester (which<br/>the class sang to the teacher&apos;s piano accompaniment) that<br/>particularly impressed me, because the sound of the piano was<br/>different than usual.  After I had developed AP I was able to &quot;play<br/>back&quot; that song in my head, and I realized that I had internalized<br/>all sorts of details: 1) it was in 3/4 time; 2) it was in D major,<br/>and 3) the difference in the sound of the piano was due to the melody<br/>being played *in octaves*.  I can still remember it, and I could play<br/>it for you today.  The important thing to observe here is that *I<br/>remembered the sounds of the pitches before I even had names for<br/>them*, so years later I was able to identify what key the piece was<br/>in!</p><p>3) My third observation is only a faint memory.  When I was around 3<br/>years old I stayed with my grandparents for a period of several<br/>months.  At the time my parents were renting an apartment on the<br/>opposite side of the city (Chicago), and it was not until my 2nd<br/>semester of kindergarten that we moved into a house that had room for<br/>the baby grand piano that was moved from my grandparents&apos; house.<br/>Anyway, while I was there, I spent a lot of time fooling around on<br/>the piano keys.  I don&apos;t remember exactly what I did, but evidently I<br/>had a very good time, because my mother later told me that she had<br/>gotten rather upset when she learned that I wasn&apos;t looking forward to<br/>returning home.  This opportunity to experiment probably played a<br/>major role in preparing me to acquire AP.</p><p>Now for the formal training.</p><p>In 1950, the accordion was very popular, and my dad had wanted to<br/>learn to play one, but never got the opportunity, so he decided to<br/>try the next best thing.  I had just turned 6 the previous fall, and<br/>he pestered me a couple of times about taking lessons, but I wasn&apos;t<br/>interested.  The third time I said yes, just to get him off my back,<br/>and I was enrolled in a 6-week trial course in one of the many<br/>accordion studios that were around at the time.  I began lessons on a<br/>rented accordion that had a two-octave treble keyboard and 12 buttons<br/>for the left hand.  For a part of the lesson the teacher had me<br/>play &quot;oom-pah-pah&quot; going up and down on all 6 pairs of bass &amp; chord<br/>buttons, just to get the feel of navigating the full extent of the<br/>bassboard.  He told me the names of each of the buttons, but it was<br/>too much to remember all at once.  One thing I did remember was that<br/>A was on one end and B-flat was on the other end (but not which was<br/>which).  As I practiced that week, I remember being especially taken<br/>with the sound of the button pair at one end, and for some<br/>inexplcable reason I felt very strongly that it should be called &quot;A&quot;,<br/>because when I played it, it seemed to be saying &quot;A-putt-putt&quot; to<br/>me.  (I know that sounds silly, but it made a lasting impression on<br/>me.)  I could hardly wait for my second lesson to find out whether it<br/>was really A or B-flat, and to my great delight, it turned out to be<br/>A after all.  Joy!  That done, I thought it might be useful if I made<br/>sound-with-name associations for the rest of them, which I did within<br/>the next few weeks.</p><p>I&apos;d like to make a few observations at this point:</p><p>1) It was the *bass*, not the treble, side of the instrument that<br/>gave me my initial impression of pitch-color.  The treble keyboard<br/>had two reeds tuned not quite in unison (musette-style), so that the<br/>frequencies beat against one another several times a second -- not<br/>the best thing for singling out pitches.  A bass button, on the other<br/>hand, simultaneously sounded several reeds tuned to 3 or 4 different<br/>octaves, and one set of these reeds will typically have the octave<br/>break at a different point in the octave from the others, so as to<br/>produce the illusion that the pitch is constantly ascending (or<br/>descending) when scales are played.  In other words, accordion basses<br/>are set up to *decrease the perception of pitch height while<br/>reinforcing (through octave doubling) the perception of pitch color!<br/>*</p><p>2) In addition, initially hearing each of these not only as bass<br/>notes but also as major triads (via the chord buttons) helped me to<br/>perceive the character or &quot;color&quot; of both a note and the major<br/>tonality of the same name.</p><p>3) What really blew me away over this past weekend was realizing that<br/>not only the kindergarten song that made the greatest impression on<br/>me, but also my favorite section of the Tchaikovsky piano concerto<br/>had the melody *in octaves*.  If you&apos;re in the process of developing<br/>AP, then I have a hunch that there&apos;s something magic about hearing<br/>the pitches in octaves.</p><p>When the trial course ended, my dad bought me an instrument with a<br/>longer keyboard (with the reeds tuned in octaves instead of off-tuned<br/>unisons) and more bass buttons, but for some reason, with summer<br/>approaching, I didn&apos;t continue with the lessons until the following<br/>fall.  In the meantime I became more comfortable on the larger<br/>instrument playing the pieces I had already learned.</p><p>My dad also spent a lot of time fooling around with the accordion,<br/>picking out melodies on the treble keyboard.  I remember one day he<br/>had a particularly frustrating time trying to find a certain note, so<br/>I directed him to the key I knew he was seeking.  Looking at me with<br/>an expression of disbelief, he tried it and was astonished that it<br/>was the correct one.  He asked how I knew that, and I told him that I<br/>had memorized the sounds made by all of the white keys.  He then had<br/>me turn my back to him, and I named each note as quickly as he played<br/>them at random.  My &quot;secret&quot; was finally out, and only then did I<br/>learn that this was something extraordinary -- something that even my<br/>mother&apos;s cousin, a very capable pianist, couldn&apos;t do.</p><p>I was going to follow this with my ideas for developing AP (based on<br/>the above experiences), both for young children and adults, for both<br/>12-ET and other tunings.  But since I have little knowledge of<br/>exactly what goes on in adult AP training courses, and since you can<br/>probably figure out most of what I might recommend from the above,<br/>and since this is already too long for a single message, I think I&apos;d<br/>better quit here and leave my suggestions for later.</p><p>Others may have similar or different experiences to report and may<br/>want to share those.  I figure, the more clues we have, the better<br/>we&apos;ll understand what&apos;s been going on in our heads.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=72535 href="#72535">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2007 5:19:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hiya George,</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t consider &quot;moderate success&quot;, such as the ability<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; to distinguish Eb from F# after many months of training,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I learned to distinguish them in about 3 hours of training.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m curious about how well this worked and was wondering if<br/>&gt; you could be more specific.  Were the 3 hours of training all<br/>&gt; in one day in a special facility, or did you do it by<br/>&gt; yourself at home?  Did you actually learn to identify each<br/>&gt; of these two pitches cold, i.e., hearing only one of them<br/>&gt; without hearing the other one first in a session?  Are you<br/>&gt; still able to do now what you did at the end of the 3 hours?<br/>&gt; Why didn&apos;t you go any farther?</p><p>As I remember it, a friend had the David L. Burge tapes,<br/>and he loaned the first couple tapes to me (in high school).<br/>The 3 hours were over two consecutive days, and didn&apos;t<br/>include the hour or two I spent listening to the tapes now<br/>that I think of it.  I drilled myself with my piano (in my<br/>house).  I did learn to recognize the pitches cold, and can<br/>still do today, though the ability never translated away<br/>from piano timbre (Burge says this is how it starts, and<br/>the ability to do it trans-timbre comes with practice).  I<br/>did try to continue with the course, but I was borrowing<br/>the tapes, which turned out to be cumbersome, and it turned<br/>out you needed a drill partner, which I couldn&apos;t find.  I<br/>got my Mom to help me a few times, and I got decent accuracy<br/>with A and C, but life was happening and ...</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; You&apos;ll soon reach a point where your<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; rough sense of pitch-height is not up to the task, and I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; suspect that may occur somewhere in the vicinity of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;moderate successs&quot; to which you refer.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No, I was using pitch color, not pitch height.  And the<br/>&gt; &gt; studies had people getting all 12 pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So there was some success, then.</p><p>Yes.  I&apos;ll dig up the papers tonight.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m wondering why there&apos;s so much bad press to the contrary.</p><p>In one of the papers, the investigator himself didn&apos;t think<br/>too highly of the success rate.  But I think he had<br/>unreasonable expectations of a college study.  It often<br/>gives me pause when I remember that most scientific knowledge<br/>is obtained this way... I&apos;ve participated in probably a dozen<br/>studies in a variety of disciplines in two States, and the<br/>bias in the subject population has always been substantial.<br/>And anything requiring any kind of effort on the part of the<br/>subjects should be considered a fool&apos;s errand.</p><p>There&apos;s a ton of ignorance about AP, as recent threads on<br/>this list show.  Then again, the social consensus on autism,<br/>or savants, or schizophrenia, or ... any mental disorder,<br/>really, is pretty overwhelming, isn&apos;t it?</p><p>I don&apos;t want it to sound like learning this stuff outside<br/>of the sensitive period is easy, like there&apos;s nothing<br/>stopping people.  It&apos;s very unlikely any adult has the time<br/>or focus to do something like this.  People spend hundreds<br/>of dollars on software like Cubase or Photoshop and never<br/>learn to use it.  I switched from QWERTY to Dvorak after<br/>a lifetime of touch-typing on the former, and it almost<br/>killed me.  Almost everyone (according to Burge) can hear<br/>the pitch-color contrast between Eb and F#.  Turning it<br/>into AP is another matter, especially, I should think, if<br/>they have a well-honed sense of RP.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; For a more informed opinion, search for the two occurrences<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of &quot;waste&quot; in the following:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.jackgrassel.com/pages/perfect_pitch.html">http://www.jackgrassel.com/pages/perfect_pitch.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The first occurrence implies you can&apos;t study both RP and AP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think it was meant to, or if it was, that you can&apos;t study<br/>&gt; both at the same time.  The point was that improving one&apos;s relative<br/>&gt; pitch is not only possible (regardless of one&apos;s age), but it&apos;s also<br/>&gt; well worth the time and effort, with none of the drawbacks of AP.<br/>&gt; Not only do I agree wholehearted with this, but I also believe that<br/>&gt; AP is not a substitute for RP and that any musician with AP should<br/>&gt; also work on RP.</p><p>Does anyone believe this?  Who&apos;s saying this, anyway?  Even<br/>Burge is adamant that both are needed.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And trying to<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;memorize&quot; isn&apos;t going to get you anywhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s rather mystical, but yes, I agree!  Following my analogy<br/>&gt; above, the first time you hear the timbre of a clarinet or oboe<br/>&gt; in a<br/>&gt; music appreciation course, you don&apos;t have to try to memorize it,<br/>&gt; because that comes automatically after listening to it once or<br/>&gt; twice.  Of course, you&apos;ll need to remember the name of the<br/>&gt; instrument producing the sound, but what you&apos;re memorizing is<br/>&gt; really the *name* of the sound rather than sound itself.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>&gt; One problem that must be dealt with in AP training, however,<br/>&gt; is that the tones being compared differ not only in pitch-color<br/>&gt; but also in pitch-height, so it would be helpful to present<br/>&gt; sounds in a way that would enhance one&apos;s perception of the<br/>&gt; former while inhibiting that of the latter.  As you&apos;ll see<br/>&gt; below, this was in fact accomplished very elegantly, and<br/>&gt; completely by chance, in my own experience of acquiring AP.</p><p>Holy crap!  I can&apos;t wait to read it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Since only 12<br/>&gt; &gt; things are involved, if it were a question of memory and<br/>&gt; &gt; exposure, lots more people would have AP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I found that I didn&apos;t have to *try* to memorize pitch-colors,<br/>&gt; because the differences were fairly obvious (is it that young<br/>&gt; children naturally hear things differently?).  The only<br/>&gt; memorization I had to do was to associate the pitch-colors<br/>&gt; with their names, so it was indeed the *names* I was<br/>&gt; memorizing.</p><p>Yes, exactly right.</p><p>More responses under separate cover...</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=72536 href="#72536">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2007 5:34:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The important thing to observe here is that *I<br/>&gt; remembered the sounds of the pitches before I even had names for<br/>&gt; them*, so years later I was able to identify what key the piece<br/>&gt; was in!</p><p>Very cool.

If it&apos;s an electronic<br/>keyboard, then I&apos;m not sure whether it would be a good idea to vary<br/>the timbre at first, because that may draw the child&apos;s attention away<br/>from hearing pitch-color.</p><p>2) Provide music (including &quot;good&quot; music) for the child to listen to,<br/>particularly music with passages played in octaves.  Don&apos;t discourage<br/>the child from repeatedly listening to the same thing, because<br/>repetition builds familiarity with the musical content, including<br/>pitch.</p><p>Notice that there are no goals, other than that of allowing these to<br/>be enjoyable experiences.</p><p>After that, then try a note-naming game, perhaps using an electronic<br/>keyboard with a timbre containing pitches in octaves (such as a pipe<br/>organ -- no vibrato, please!).</p><p>For musicians without AP who want to attempt to acquire it without<br/>assistance, I have a few ideas that you could try:</p><p>1) If you happen to have any recordings of music that you listened to<br/>and enjoyed as a young child, then listen to them again today,<br/>tomorrow, the day after, for several days.  It doesn&apos;t matter how<br/>childish or silly the music might seem.  The idea is to revisit,<br/>revive, and reconnect with music that you may have internalized at an<br/>early age.  (It&apos;s important that you hear them in the same key as<br/>before, so if the playback equipment you had as a child was off-speed<br/>by any significant amount, then you probably won&apos;t hear it in the<br/>same key, which defeats the purpose.)  If you can&apos;t think of anything<br/>for this step, then go on to step #2.</p><p>2) Repeat step #1 with recordings of music that you&apos;re already<br/>familiar with (even if only as an adult), preferably with very<br/>memorable passages played in octaves.  It should be something that&apos;s<br/>invariably played in a single &quot;standard&quot; key.  If nothing else<br/>immediately comes to mind, then try listenening to the first part of<br/>Beeethoven&apos;s 5th symphony (up to where the horns play in unison to<br/>usher in the 2nd theme) at least once or twice a day, every day for a<br/>week.</p><p>3) Find a quiet room where you won&apos;t be interrupted by anyone else<br/>and won&apos;t hear any music coming from outside.  Have some sort of<br/>fixed-pitch musical instrument (or computer program) handy on which<br/>you can play reference pitches, but don&apos;t play anything yet.  If<br/>you&apos;ve just listened to some music and still have it going through<br/>your head, then stop and try again later.  (If it&apos;s still going<br/>through your head a half-hour later, then maybe something desirable<br/>is happening, and you should go ahead anyway.)  Now think of one of<br/>the pieces of music that you listened to in #1 or #2, above.  Try to<br/>imagine the actual sounds, and then attempt to sing the notes aloud.<br/>Then play the notes on your reference instrument to see how close you<br/>came.  If you succeeded, then you may be ready for step #4 (but if,<br/>after some time, you didn&apos;t, you can try step #4 anyway).</p><p>4) On an instrument of fixed pitch, play around with single notes in<br/>simple patterns, or (if you&apos;re able) in octaves,  or use a timbre<br/>that sounds in octaves.  Some of these melody patterns could be<br/>portions of what you listened to in steps #1 and #2, above (in the<br/>same key).  Don&apos;t make any particular effort to &quot;memorize&quot; any of the<br/>sounds, but just spend some time every day playng the same things<br/>each time.  Repetition is the key to getting these things to sink<br/>into your head.  After a week, start a session by thinking of one of<br/>the simple melody patterns you played, and try to &quot;play it back&quot; in<br/>your mind and/or sing it aloud before playing it on the keyboard.  If<br/>you succeed in coming up with the correct pitch a few times (in<br/>separate sessions), then try playing the same things using a<br/>different timbre (or a different instrument; at this point you might<br/>try using an instrument with flexible pitch, if you&apos;re reasonably<br/>proficient), to begin generalizing your impression of the pitch-<br/>colors.</p><p>5) At this point you may want to try some AP drills.  If the previous<br/>steps were as successful as I&apos;m hoping, you may find this step is<br/>unnecessary.</p><p>I need to emphasize that I have no experience or training AP in<br/>adults, and my only qualifications in making the above suggestions<br/>are that I&apos;m able to remember what was helpful in enabling me to<br/>acquire AP, unassisted, at the age of 6.</p><p>If you&apos;ve acquired AP in 12-ET and want to develop it microtonally,<br/>then I have a couple more suggestions, based on the above techniques,<br/>that I&apos;ve been able to verify as effective from my own experience:</p><p>6) Select one or more microtonal pieces in a tuning that you&apos;d like<br/>to internalize.  Listen to it repeatedly (in separate sessions over a<br/>period of time) until you can &quot;play back&quot; in your head their most<br/>impressionable parts.  It might be helpful to obtain a score of one<br/>or more of these, in order to help you associate the pitches with<br/>their notes (which might be necessary, if there are any strange<br/>progressions).  If no music exists in the tuning you&apos;d like, then it<br/>might be best to write something, in which case you&apos;ll either have a<br/>score, or you won&apos;t need it (since you&apos;ll already be familiar with<br/>the piece).</p><p>When I first experimented with a retuned electronic organ some years<br/>back, I tuned 12-note subsets of 31-ET and recorded them on tape for<br/>my own amazement.  After listening to some of these a few times, I<br/>found that I was able to remember the pitches.</p><p>I&apos;ve collected a lot of sound files from MMM and often listen to my<br/>favorite ones.  Among the ones I&apos;m able to play back (at least<br/>portions) in my head are Harry Partch&apos;s &quot;Two Greek Studies&quot; in JI,<br/>Aaron Johnson&apos;s &quot;Juggler&quot; in 19-ET, Herman Miller&apos;s &quot;Mizarian<br/>Porcupine&quot; in 15-EDO (particularly that legendary progression at the<br/>very end), and the fragment of a jazz piece I started using a 9-tone<br/>MOS subset of 17-ET.</p><p>7) Do step #3 with one or more of the pieces you selected in step #6.</p><p>8) Do step #4 using your chosen tuning.</p><p>Notice that, except for step #5, no drills (or activities requiring<br/>the assistance of another person) were involved.</p><p>Don&apos;t be afraid to experiment with variations on the above, or with<br/>your own ideas.</p><p>For anyone trying out any of these ideas, I wish you success!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=72563 href="#72563">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2007 3:30:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Perhaps a relevant anecdote from (literally) yesterday- my son (3<br/>1/2 years old) asked me to sing him the Roman song (his favorite<br/>movie is &quot;Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, music by Tiomkin).

Were the 3 hours of training all in one day in<br/>a<br/>&gt; special facility, or did you do it by yourself at home?  Did you<br/>&gt; actually learn to identify each of these two pitches cold, i.e.,<br/>&gt; hearing only one of them without hearing the other one first in a<br/>&gt; session?  Are you still able to do now what you did at the end of<br/>the<br/>&gt; 3 hours?  Why didn&apos;t you go any farther?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In order to distinguish middle C from the C an octave lower or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; higher, it&apos;s necessary to use information other than an<br/>impression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the &quot;pitch-color&quot; perceived by persons with AP.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Right.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Fortunately, an octave separation between tones is sufficient<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to distinguish one from the other using the rough sense of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pitch-height that all musicians possess:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Right.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; let&apos;s try that in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a subsequent session with the tones a major 7th apart, then a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; minor 7th, then a major 6th, etc., making the distance<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; progressively smaller.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now that I think about it, this method may actually be useful for<br/>&gt; developing AP, because it keeps one (and only one) pitch constant<br/>&gt; within a varying context, so you may actually learn to recognize<br/>its<br/>&gt; pitch-color through many repetitions.  (But that&apos;s just<br/>an &quot;aside&quot;.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You&apos;ll soon reach a point where your<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; rough sense of pitch-height is not up to the task, and I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; suspect that may occur somewhere in the vicinity of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;moderate successs&quot; to which you refer.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No, I was using pitch color, not pitch height.  And the<br/>&gt; &gt; studies had people getting all 12 pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So there was some success, then.  I&apos;m wondering why there&apos;s so<br/>much<br/>&gt; bad press to the contrary.  Perhaps some of these courses are not<br/>as<br/>&gt; good as the one you took.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; For a more informed opinion, search for the two occurrences<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of &quot;waste&quot; in the following:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.jackgrassel.com/pages/perfect_pitch.html">http://www.jackgrassel.com/pages/perfect_pitch.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The first occurrence implies you can&apos;t study both RP and AP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think it was meant to, or if it was, that you can&apos;t study<br/>&gt; both at the same time.  The point was that improving one&apos;s<br/>relative<br/>&gt; pitch is not only possible (regardless of one&apos;s age), but it&apos;s<br/>also<br/>&gt; well worth the time and effort, with none of the drawbacks of AP.<br/>&gt; Not only do I agree wholehearted with this, but I also believe<br/>that<br/>&gt; AP is not a substitute for RP and that any musician with AP should<br/>&gt; also work on RP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The second discusses 350 hours of learning to distinguish<br/>&gt; &gt; two notes.  I don&apos;t believe *anyone* would have the patience<br/>&gt; &gt; to work on two notes for that long to achieve success.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t say exactly what they worked on or how they worked on<br/>it,<br/>&gt; only that the results weren&apos;t any better than that.  I would have<br/>to<br/>&gt; agree that if this was the case, it was a colossal waste of time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; He<br/>&gt; &gt; also mentions some guy wandering around with a tuning fork<br/>&gt; &gt; for a year.  I did that for a month in 1994, and I discovered<br/>&gt; &gt; that this can never work to train AP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You don&apos;t know what<br/>&gt; &gt; to listen for without comparing tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.  It&apos;s like observing the differences in timbre between a<br/>&gt; clarinet, oboe, trumpet, and violin.  You more easily perceive the<br/>&gt; characteristic sound of each one of these by comparing it with the<br/>&gt; others.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And trying to<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;memorize&quot; isn&apos;t going to get you anywhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s rather mystical, but yes, I agree!  Following my analogy<br/>&gt; above, the first time you hear the timbre of a clarinet or oboe in<br/>a<br/>&gt; music appreciation course, you don&apos;t have to try to memorize it,<br/>&gt; because that comes automatically after listening to it once or<br/>&gt; twice.  Of course, you&apos;ll need to remember the name of the<br/>instrument<br/>&gt; producing the sound, but what you&apos;re memorizing is really the<br/>*name*<br/>&gt; of the sound rather than sound itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One problem that must be dealt with in AP training, however, is<br/>that<br/>&gt; the tones being compared differ not only in pitch-color but also<br/>in<br/>&gt; pitch-height, so it would be helpful to present sounds in a way<br/>that<br/>&gt; would enhance one&apos;s perception of the former while inhibiting that<br/>of<br/>&gt; the latter.  As you&apos;ll see below, this was in fact accomplished<br/>very<br/>&gt; elegantly, and completely by chance, in my own experience of<br/>&gt; acquiring AP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Since only 12<br/>&gt; &gt; things are involved, if it were a question of memory and<br/>&gt; &gt; exposure, lots more people would have AP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I found that I didn&apos;t have to *try* to memorize pitch-colors,<br/>because<br/>&gt; the differences were fairly obvious (is it that young children<br/>&gt; naturally hear things differently?).  The only memorization I had<br/>to<br/>&gt; do was to associate the pitch-colors with their names, so it was<br/>&gt; indeed the *names* I was memorizing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks. I think a note-naming game will be sufficient,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Contrary to what you might think, I have good reason to believe<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that it might *not* be the best way,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; First off, wouldn&apos;t you say that Weiger&apos;s method is a &quot;simple<br/>&gt; &gt; note-naming game&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, it&apos;s necessarily simple.  I didn&apos;t say it wouldn&apos;t work, only<br/>&gt; that I didn&apos;t think it was necessarily the best way -- at least by<br/>&gt; itself.  As you&apos;ll see below, I think that it helps if this sort<br/>of<br/>&gt; activity is preceded by other, less structured, experiences in<br/>which<br/>&gt; music and/or musical pitches are absorbed and internalized in a<br/>way<br/>&gt; that literally sets the child up for success in the game.  These<br/>&gt; kinds of activities can be provided at an earlier age than might<br/>be<br/>&gt; appropriate for a note-naming game, because they allow the child<br/>to<br/>&gt; have fun on his/her own terms and also avoid putting pressure on<br/>the<br/>&gt; child to &quot;perform&quot; in a predetermined manner in order to produce<br/>&gt; certain expected results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but I must have done something right to have come by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it almost effortlessly -- and I believe I&apos;ve figured it out!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, spill the beans then.  That&apos;s the 2nd time I&apos;ve asked,<br/>&gt; &gt; despite my editing-out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay, sorry, but I couldn&apos;t put it in a short reply.

It&apos;s possible that others reading this may pick up on<br/>&gt; things that I&apos;ve missed, so I&apos;m sharing this in the hope that we<br/>may<br/>&gt; all learn something from it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, I need to relate several things not a part of my formal<br/>&gt; musical training that I believe prepared me for AP development:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) I began music lessons at age 6, but in the couple of years<br/>prior<br/>&gt; to that I enjoyed listening to phonograph records (that&apos;s what we<br/>&gt; called those 78 rpm disks back in the forties).  In the course of<br/>a<br/>&gt; couple of years I had listened to my favorite ones countless<br/>times,<br/>&gt; and the sounds in vivid detail (including the pitches) became<br/>fixed<br/>&gt; in my memory.  My #1 favorite was the opening section of the first<br/>&gt; movement of Tchaikovsky&apos;s first piano concerto.  It wasn&apos;t until<br/>&gt; years later that I was surprised to learn, hearing a pop recording<br/>on<br/>&gt; the radio that I had listened to only days before on the<br/>phonograph,<br/>&gt; that the turntable was rotating too fast, transposing everything<br/>up<br/>&gt; roughly a semitone.  The Tchaikovsky that I first heard in D major<br/>&gt; was supposed to be in D-flat!  Likewise, &quot;Waltz of the Flowers&quot;<br/>from<br/>&gt; the Nutcracker, which I thought was in E-flat, was actually in D!<br/>&gt; Fortunately, this did not take place at the time I was memorizing<br/>&gt; note names.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) I began kindergarten at the age of 4 years, 10 months (beating<br/>the<br/>&gt; deadline by only 3 days), and I recall one song that semester<br/>(which<br/>&gt; the class sang to the teacher&apos;s piano accompaniment) that<br/>&gt; particularly impressed me, because the sound of the piano was<br/>&gt; different than usual.  After I had developed AP I was able<br/>to &quot;play<br/>&gt; back&quot; that song in my head, and I realized that I had internalized<br/>&gt; all sorts of details: 1) it was in 3/4 time; 2) it was in D major,<br/>&gt; and 3) the difference in the sound of the piano was due to the<br/>melody<br/>&gt; being played *in octaves*.  I can still remember it, and I could<br/>play<br/>&gt; it for you today.  The important thing to observe here is that *I<br/>&gt; remembered the sounds of the pitches before I even had names for<br/>&gt; them*, so years later I was able to identify what key the piece<br/>was<br/>&gt; in!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) My third observation is only a faint memory.  When I was around<br/>3<br/>&gt; years old I stayed with my grandparents for a period of several<br/>&gt; months.  At the time my parents were renting an apartment on the<br/>&gt; opposite side of the city (Chicago), and it was not until my 2nd<br/>&gt; semester of kindergarten that we moved into a house that had room<br/>for<br/>&gt; the baby grand piano that was moved from my grandparents&apos; house.<br/>&gt; Anyway, while I was there, I spent a lot of time fooling around on<br/>&gt; the piano keys.  I don&apos;t remember exactly what I did, but<br/>evidently I<br/>&gt; had a very good time, because my mother later told me that she had<br/>&gt; gotten rather upset when she learned that I wasn&apos;t looking forward<br/>to<br/>&gt; returning home.  This opportunity to experiment probably played a<br/>&gt; major role in preparing me to acquire AP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now for the formal training.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 1950, the accordion was very popular, and my dad had wanted to<br/>&gt; learn to play one, but never got the opportunity, so he decided to<br/>&gt; try the next best thing.  I had just turned 6 the previous fall,<br/>and<br/>&gt; he pestered me a couple of times about taking lessons, but I<br/>wasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; interested.  The third time I said yes, just to get him off my<br/>back,<br/>&gt; and I was enrolled in a 6-week trial course in one of the many<br/>&gt; accordion studios that were around at the time.  I began lessons<br/>on a<br/>&gt; rented accordion that had a two-octave treble keyboard and 12<br/>buttons<br/>&gt; for the left hand.  For a part of the lesson the teacher had me<br/>&gt; play &quot;oom-pah-pah&quot; going up and down on all 6 pairs of bass &amp;<br/>chord<br/>&gt; buttons, just to get the feel of navigating the full extent of the<br/>&gt; bassboard.  He told me the names of each of the buttons, but it<br/>was<br/>&gt; too much to remember all at once.  One thing I did remember was<br/>that<br/>&gt; A was on one end and B-flat was on the other end (but not which<br/>was<br/>&gt; which).  As I practiced that week, I remember being especially<br/>taken<br/>&gt; with the sound of the button pair at one end, and for some<br/>&gt; inexplcable reason I felt very strongly that it should be<br/>called &quot;A&quot;,<br/>&gt; because when I played it, it seemed to be saying &quot;A-putt-putt&quot; to<br/>&gt; me.  (I know that sounds silly, but it made a lasting impression<br/>on<br/>&gt; me.)  I could hardly wait for my second lesson to find out whether<br/>it<br/>&gt; was really A or B-flat, and to my great delight, it turned out to<br/>be<br/>&gt; A after all.  Joy!  That done, I thought it might be useful if I<br/>made<br/>&gt; sound-with-name associations for the rest of them, which I did<br/>within<br/>&gt; the next few weeks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to make a few observations at this point:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) It was the *bass*, not the treble, side of the instrument that<br/>&gt; gave me my initial impression of pitch-color.  The treble keyboard<br/>&gt; had two reeds tuned not quite in unison (musette-style), so that<br/>the<br/>&gt; frequencies beat against one another several times a second -- not<br/>&gt; the best thing for singling out pitches.  A bass button, on the<br/>other<br/>&gt; hand, simultaneously sounded several reeds tuned to 3 or 4<br/>different<br/>&gt; octaves, and one set of these reeds will typically have the octave<br/>&gt; break at a different point in the octave from the others, so as to<br/>&gt; produce the illusion that the pitch is constantly ascending (or<br/>&gt; descending) when scales are played.  In other words, accordion<br/>basses<br/>&gt; are set up to *decrease the perception of pitch height while<br/>&gt; reinforcing (through octave doubling) the perception of pitch<br/>color!<br/>&gt; *<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) In addition, initially hearing each of these not only as bass<br/>&gt; notes but also as major triads (via the chord buttons) helped me<br/>to<br/>&gt; perceive the character or &quot;color&quot; of both a note and the major<br/>&gt; tonality of the same name.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) What really blew me away over this past weekend was realizing<br/>that<br/>&gt; not only the kindergarten song that made the greatest impression<br/>on<br/>&gt; me, but also my favorite section of the Tchaikovsky piano concerto<br/>&gt; had the melody *in octaves*.  If you&apos;re in the process of<br/>developing<br/>&gt; AP, then I have a hunch that there&apos;s something magic about hearing<br/>&gt; the pitches in octaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When the trial course ended, my dad bought me an instrument with a<br/>&gt; longer keyboard (with the reeds tuned in octaves instead of off-<br/>tuned<br/>&gt; unisons) and more bass buttons, but for some reason, with summer<br/>&gt; approaching, I didn&apos;t continue with the lessons until the<br/>following<br/>&gt; fall.  In the meantime I became more comfortable on the larger<br/>&gt; instrument playing the pieces I had already learned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My dad also spent a lot of time fooling around with the accordion,<br/>&gt; picking out melodies on the treble keyboard.  I remember one day<br/>he<br/>&gt; had a particularly frustrating time trying to find a certain note,<br/>so<br/>&gt; I directed him to the key I knew he was seeking.  Looking at me<br/>with<br/>&gt; an expression of disbelief, he tried it and was astonished that it<br/>&gt; was the correct one.  He asked how I knew that, and I told him<br/>that I<br/>&gt; had memorized the sounds made by all of the white keys.  He then<br/>had<br/>&gt; me turn my back to him, and I named each note as quickly as he<br/>played<br/>&gt; them at random.  My &quot;secret&quot; was finally out, and only then did I<br/>&gt; learn that this was something extraordinary -- something that even<br/>my<br/>&gt; mother&apos;s cousin, a very capable pianist, couldn&apos;t do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was going to follow this with my ideas for developing AP (based<br/>on<br/>&gt; the above experiences), both for young children and adults, for<br/>both<br/>&gt; 12-ET and other tunings.  But since I have little knowledge of<br/>&gt; exactly what goes on in adult AP training courses, and since you<br/>can<br/>&gt; probably figure out most of what I might recommend from the above,<br/>&gt; and since this is already too long for a single message, I think<br/>I&apos;d<br/>&gt; better quit here and leave my suggestions for later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Others may have similar or different experiences to report and may<br/>&gt; want to share those.  I figure, the more clues we have, the better<br/>&gt; we&apos;ll understand what&apos;s been going on in our heads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --George<br/>&gt;</p></div>
