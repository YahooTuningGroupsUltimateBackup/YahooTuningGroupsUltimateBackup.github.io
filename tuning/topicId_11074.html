I&apos;ll check the score tonight after work, and will only reply off-list. If Newband misled you, shame on them!</p><p>(...and I tended to think of &quot;live electronics&quot; in terms of the Cage/Tudor pieces, or similar live processing - hopefully this is not *too* semantical a difference...)</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div>
