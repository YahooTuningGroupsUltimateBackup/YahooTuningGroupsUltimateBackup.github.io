Thai musicians accept do<br/>accept 7-tET, but they also accept modest deviations from it, which<br/>usually come up in practice since ETs are very hard to tune by ear,<br/>especially on instruments such as the Thai xylophones, etc.</p><p>By contrast, a study of Central African musicians employing 5-tone<br/>scales showed that, while they felt 5-tET was OK, they preferred<br/>somewhat unequal tunings.</p></div>
