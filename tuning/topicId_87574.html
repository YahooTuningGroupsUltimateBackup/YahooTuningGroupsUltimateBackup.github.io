Metatunings like 11-EDO and 23-EDO don&apos;t approximate 3/2 well (if they can even be said to approximate it AT ALL), so calling them &quot;equal temperaments&quot; seems misleading (though you could technically describe them as just &quot;really exaggerated&quot; temperaments).  Really, there isn&apos;t a strong technical difference between ET and EDO, just an aesthetic one.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Cody Hallenbeck &lt;codyhallenbeck@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; EDO is an acronym for equal division of the octave, and came about to define<br/>&gt; what was being equally divided, there being some work  done in scales that<br/>&gt; equally divide other interals, such as the 12th, in the equal version of<br/>&gt; bohlein-pierce.
