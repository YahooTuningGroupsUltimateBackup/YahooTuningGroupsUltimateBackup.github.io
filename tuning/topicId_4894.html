No, I wouldn&apos;t trade these for my copy of the first edition of &quot;Genesis&quot;, even though I didn&apos;t have the presence of mind to take it along and have it autographed when I met with Harry in the summer of 1960 in Champaign.  He also had one word to describe Nickolais:  &quot;idiot&quot;.  It was something about not being able to count in 5/4 time or perhaps a slightly more difficult rhythm.  As for the Mazda marimba, it was the idea of one of his students and Harry thought it would be too fragile.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Jonathan M.
