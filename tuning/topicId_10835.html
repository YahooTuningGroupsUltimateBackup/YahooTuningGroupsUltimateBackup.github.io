Your answer was OK. I had read<br/>only the begining. English is not easy for me. I stop often my reading (by<br/>fatigue) if I think that I have understood essential. My remark for value<br/>22 was insignificant : reason was a misinterpretation after too fast reading.</p><p>I&apos;m glad that your subsequent message touch important divergence. But I<br/>have a problem. It&apos;s hard to explain a new approach which is opposed to<br/>common opinion of musicologists, acousticians, microtonalists, etc. It&apos;s<br/>almost impossible, for me, in english. It&apos;s like boxing with gloves<br/>attached. I have to decide if I will try in english. If yes, perhaps it<br/>will be long.</p><p>For the moment, I would like to dissipate only a misunderstanding. When I<br/>use the term &quot;gamme&quot; in french (that I translate by &quot;scale&quot;) I don&apos;t refer<br/>to the standard meaning which is much concerned with fixed notes, tuning,<br/>acoustic, transposition, interfaces, etc.</p><p>As music is a human communication (and expression) I want to describe the<br/>implicit conditions of intelligibity. The tonal segment of this<br/>intelligibility depend mostly, in my opinion, of the only elementary<br/>invariance of time &amp; frequency thru acoustical channel which permit<br/>algebrical structures (concerning time &amp; frequency) to serve as paradigm in<br/>(schematic) form recognition. If you name &quot;ideal&quot; the conception of<br/>Zarlino, you have to go up for qualify mine&apos;s.</p><p>You presume, because I was speaking only of JI structure, that I reject<br/>using of temperament. It will be odd after I had severely criticized, in<br/>&quot;F&eacute;tichisme du num&eacute;rique et rationalit&eacute; musicale&quot; the use of obsessive<br/>precision. You will never find number like 234.567891234567 in my texts.<br/>It&apos;s absolutely ridiculous. There is no irrationality in perception. There<br/>are two rationnal dimensions : rationality of widths (0 1 2 3 4 ..) and<br/>rationality of sonances (2/1 3/2 4/3 ..). Actual mathematics join in real<br/>field the two perceptive dimensions, inserting irrationality. It&apos;s good for<br/>acoustical description of sonic matter. True tonal matter need a more<br/>sophisticated mathematical approach respecting the concern of musical<br/>apprehension. At end, If you think I reject temperament look at</p><p><a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/jchal/jchalmers.htm">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/jchal/jchalmers.htm</a></p><p>I stop here.
