The Chopi&apos;s of southern Mozambique take five tone scales out<br/>of there heptatonic scale. the same process occurs in Japanese, and Pelog is often taken out to 7<br/>places with subsets of 5 taken.

Somehow these two don&apos;t seem to contradict each other.

Perhaps some people, perhaps many<br/>musicians and theorists in the past century, have had a deep<br/>familiarity with various musical styles, a deep familiarity with<br/>musical tunings over broad geography and history, and a deep<br/>understanding of how the two are intertwined . . . perhaps these<br/>people, hesitantly at first, might begin to see _patterns_ and<br/>_connections_ amongst these facts and insights, until a _unified<br/>view_ of the whole picture comes into focus. Now let&apos;s say each of<br/>these people comes up with their own system or set of systems which<br/>fall perfectly into the scheme of patterns and connections they&apos;ve<br/>found, but _expand_ the heretofore available pitch possibilities in<br/>one direction or another.</p><p>Now let&apos;s say another such musician comes along, at the end of said<br/>century, and comes at it with the same attitude and knowledge . . .<br/>and finds that a great number of the disparate schemes that have been<br/>devised over the past century . . . and comes up with a _broader<br/>unified view_ that encompasses those as well! Should not such a<br/>musician then attempt to submerse him/herself in the sonic worlds<br/>implied by expanding this insight in one direction or another, until<br/>his/her imagination begins to _make music_ with such materials?</p><p>My heroes of &quot;THE PROCESS OF &quot;CREATION&quot; OF MUSIC INTEGRATED WITH THE<br/>PROCESS OF (SONIC)&quot;PRESENTATION&quot; OF THAT MUSIC&quot; in our &quot;default&quot; 12-<br/>tone equal-tempered system, the jazz musicians, Parker, Gillespie,<br/>Powell, Coltrane, and their progeny, work from deep cultural<br/>influences, but also from a very sophisticated *theoretical*<br/>understanding of the 12-tone system and its melodic and harmonic<br/>structures and behaviors. No young musician today, aside from the<br/>rare Art Tatum born once a generation, is going to be able to make a<br/>serious statement in the jazz style without assimilating both the<br/>deep cultural influences, _and_ the sophisticated harmonic theory of<br/>jazz (I challenge you to name an exception to this). As these<br/>innovators found the theory of their musical system invaluable in the<br/>effort to take their influences a step further, surely someone<br/>seeking to take their music to an entirely new tuning system is going<br/>to be at least as motivated to study the foundations of musical<br/>harmony and their logical expansion. And as long as they&apos;re doing<br/>that, why not let the study _influence_ their choice of tuning<br/>systems to try out? Sure, one could try out lots and lots of tuning<br/>systems with musical trial and error.

My tentative guide has to be the vocal-<br/>&gt; based music of world cultures, which, despite the complete<br/>&gt; flexibility of the voice, in virtually every case, has settled on<br/>&gt; some set of conceptually fixed systems -- often, as in &quot;raga&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;maqam&quot;, something beyond a &quot;scale&quot; but still implying only a<br/>&gt; limited set of pitch options.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 3rd Question: IS THE PROCESS OF &quot;CREATION&quot; OF MUSIC SEPARABLE (IN<br/>&gt; &gt; CONCEPT) FROM THE PROCESS OF (SONIC)&quot;PRESENTATION&quot; OF THAT MUSIC?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The West operated that way for some time, but perhaps that&apos;s the<br/>&gt; exception rather than the rule.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 4th Question: IF one would answer yes to the 3rd Question (above):<br/>&gt; &gt; CAN MUSIC BE CREATED BY ONE WHO HAD NEVER ENGAGED IN THE HUMAN<br/>&gt; &gt; EXPERIENTIAL PROCESS OF PRESENTATION (ONE *PLAYING* THE SOUNDS)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, sure, but personally I find such music tends to pale in<br/>&gt; comparison with music fully imagined, in real time, by someone with<br/>a<br/>&gt; rich cultural heritage -- especially those few who have mastered a<br/>&gt; variety of cultural expressions and combined those influences. These<br/>&gt; are the true musical masters of our world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 5th Question: IF one would answer yes to the 4th Question (above):<br/>&gt; &gt; HOW WOULD ANY CONCEPTUAL &quot;MUSICAL STRUCTURE&quot; (AS OPPOSED TO ROTE<br/>&gt; &gt; INSTRUCTIONS) AID YOU IN THE &quot;KNOWING&quot; OF WHAT THE COMPOSITION<br/>&gt; WOULD<br/>&gt; &gt; SOUND LIKE UPON PRESENTATION (HAVING NO &quot;GROUNDING&quot; IN HAVING<br/>HEARD<br/>&gt; &gt; THE SOUNDS THEMSELVES RESULTING FROM THE APPLICATION, IN SOME<br/>&gt; MANNER,<br/>&gt; &gt; OF SUCH A &quot;MUSICAL STRUCTURE&quot; TO THE DECISIONS OF WHICH *NOTE(S)*<br/>&gt; TO<br/>&gt; &gt; SELECT WITHIN THE BODY OF THE COMPOSITION)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think I&apos;d ever dream of attempting such a thing. But without<br/>&gt; opening and training our ears, either via some system or via the<br/>&gt; total pitch continuum, we (well, perhaps I) would never achieve the<br/>&gt; familiarity with new pitch materials necessary to imagine, and hence<br/>&gt; compose, music using such materials.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems (to me) that, where it comes to the *WHEN* of placing<br/>&gt; &gt; musical notes/chords, we would probably *not* expect even a genius<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; be able to simply look at a bunch of vertical lines on a piece of<br/>&gt; &gt; paper, arranged in various multi-periodic patterns across the page<br/>&gt; &gt; (beatiful to the eye, or not) to, upon viewing the pattern, *know*<br/>&gt; &gt; what it would *actually* sound like played on a percussion<br/>&gt; instrument<br/>&gt; &gt; (s)!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;re talking about a written score or part, I think you<br/>&gt; underestimate many, if not most, professional musicians!

No &quot;point of (inductive) reference&quot; can exist<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; a conceptual framework which does not derive (in full) from the<br/>&gt; &gt; actual (consumated) process in question - the (human) &quot;hearing&quot; of<br/>&gt; it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a very reasonable thought . . .
