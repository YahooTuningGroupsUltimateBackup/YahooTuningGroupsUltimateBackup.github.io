Did I miss something?<br/>In my opinion it doesn&apos;t need to be replaced, why. But because chromatic system became a base of western music culture, it was enough used in the historical music of many styles until now and microtonality is one of possible future ways how to develop music. If we have more tones, we have more possibilities for melody and harmony. Increasing the quantity can be reflected also in increase in quality (hopefully), and for sure some new esthetics will come from it.

Since some members of the list proposed scales with more than 12 tones per octave, they know that their proposals have the same function. Should the improvement occurrs, the new scale would have replaced 12 TET partially.</p><p>He wrote:<br/>&quot;If we have more tones, we have more possibilities for melody and harmony&quot;.</p><p>-- I think that the more we increase the number of tones, harmony becomes more dispersed like if we add three or four different flavors to the classic and original peruvian &quot;pisco sour&quot;, despite the combined taste is acceptable, the good taster has lost its classical formula.

So<br/>restoring these double notes polarities adds possibilities of expression, not only melodically but also because in most cases, the<br/>choice of one polarity or the other changes the favoured modes of a<br/>scale, and therefore their emotional content.<br/>But double tones have the problem to add complexity in some of the<br/>instruments manufacture, as well as in the musical practice, and I<br/>believe that the use of temperament came mainly because of these two<br/>problems.<br/>In the end a scale, like a drink or other cultural objects, is also<br/>part of a geographic and/or ethnic identity, and it&apos;s not rare to see<br/>that different neighbouring countries or even villages use slighthly<br/>different versions of the same scales, thus marking their preferences<br/>as you said, for one &quot;classical formula&quot; over  another.<br/>What&apos;s your receipe of the peruvian Pisco sour BTW ? how many drops<br/>of Amargo de Angostura for one glass ? ;)</p><p>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div>
