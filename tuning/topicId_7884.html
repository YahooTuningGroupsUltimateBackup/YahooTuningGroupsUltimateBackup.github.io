That&apos;s why I suggested 24/19 -- it&apos;s<br/> still a long shot, but may be within the realm of possibility due to the<br/> common overtone. &gt;&gt;</p><p>If the 9/8 is also present and the timbres are rich in harmonics (and<br/>especially so when amplified), then it&apos;s not only possible but quite<br/>beautiful. This was featured in some performances during the golden days of<br/>the Theatre of Eternal Music.  One of the most stunning things I have ever<br/>heard was a recording of the group including oscillators, Tony Conrad&apos;s<br/>violin and La Monte Young, Terry Riley and Marian Zazeela singing.  In<br/>addition to the above, to a sustained (octaves ignored here) 4:6:7:9 drone,<br/>Young and Riley would take turns going to the 9:8 above the 7, giving a<br/>complete chord of 32:48:56:63:72. They would lock into this dissonance by<br/>listening closely to beats, making sure that the beating did not change speed.</p></div>
