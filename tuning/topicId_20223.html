Very often I find myself in the camp of The Dan Stearns<br/>Institute of wacky fifths.  Interestingly, Scala doesn&apos;t recognize<br/>this as a fifth, but it does function as one in this tuning.  I<br/>wonder what is the boundary at which Scala denies &quot;fifthdom&quot; for an<br/>interval.  Anyone know?  Manuel?</p><p>It is interesting to note that Scala recognizes 8 fifths @ an average<br/>of 697.671, but apparently the 23/15 is out of the range of what<br/>Scala considers a fifth.</p><p>&gt; And I&apos;ve stared at that 30/23 substituting for the 23/17.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sitting around thinking &apos;how did it occur to him to<br/>&gt; do that?&apos; cos I can&apos;t think of any way that it would<br/>&gt; occur to me to do that. Like, what&apos;s the deal with that?<br/>&gt; Is it because of folding the pivot point into an octave:<br/>&gt; 2:1 / 23:15 = 30:23? Is that it? It is a &apos;secret&apos; octave<br/>&gt; reference?</p><p>You are correct! This is one species of this kind of scale, where I<br/>wanted to use the inversion of the fifth generator.  But as you<br/>perceptively noticed, the other species, does have the 23/17 (utonal<br/>versions exist too). I&apos;m not sure yet which I prefer - I really like<br/>the sound of both.</p><p>The interesting and infinitely useful thing about this kind of<br/>construction, is that the symmetry can be &quot;mirrored&quot; from a point<br/>other than the 2/1.</p><p>Here I used a short chain of two 23/15. So the 529/225 behaves like<br/>what would be the 2/1 in a &quot;normal&quot; JI tuning. All of the ascending<br/>intervals are merely inverted at the 529/225.</p><p>This scale is a constant structure, and an interesting facet of this,<br/>is the &quot;Spiral&quot; of the 23/15 that runs over the range of the keyboard.</p><p>&gt; You are driving me crazy Jacky with your tunings that I<br/>&gt; cannot figure out and which sound so darn good!!</p><p>Glad to spread a little of this around - I&apos;ll go buggy if I keep it<br/>to myself.  This kind of tuning is something so near and dear to me,<br/>but I&apos;ve posted little about it.  It is my hope that others will come<br/>forth to speak about their methods of working with non-octave tuning<br/>systems.  I&apos;m somewhat familiar with Gary Morrison&apos;s 88cet - but I<br/>know there&apos;s many more folks too that enjoy these varieties.</p><p>&gt; And furthermore you are completely ruining my<br/>&gt; philosophical objections to just intonation!</p><p>An interesting statement, as I have probably worked in a reverse<br/>order here - and I know what you mean too. Another huge facet of my<br/>research into this is Non-Octave ETs.  This is a wonderful world too,<br/>which has many extremely practical uses.  I&apos;ll be happy to post about<br/>this too if any are interested.</p><p>&gt; How dare you<br/>&gt; send me just scales that I like!</p><p>He, he!  Thanks!  Glad you enjoyed it!  :  )</p><p>&gt; What about all of my<br/>&gt; years of theorizing and pontificating and developing a<br/>&gt; finely crafted bad attitude about JI? All that will have<br/>&gt; to be defenestrated now!!</p><p>Well, I think what may turn you off - and it does me too - is &quot;JI<br/>Conservatism&quot;.  There was a former list member who euphemistically<br/>stated that my goals with rational theory differ dramatically from<br/>most Just Intonationalists. I didn&apos;t perceive them to be receptive to<br/>it at all, but I can&apos;t disagree with this point either. My music<br/>requires more than 5-7 Limit Ratios. Great rational treasures are<br/>found in the higher primes. It can be a challenging task -<br/>compositionally - to make the leap beyond 5-7, and we see occasional<br/>effort (in surprising places and journals), to make us believe that<br/>nothing of value lies beyond 7. This I categorically reject. And<br/>here&apos;s the reason:  &quot;5-7&quot; may be good for harmonic languages, which<br/>may care to have music function in a sonic manner, not that different<br/>from 12 tET; but what about the Melodic Frontiers?  I have to reject<br/>any philosophy of 5-7 JI which requires me to give up one particle of<br/>the melodic treasures of higher primes. This is the main difference -<br/>I&apos;m not all about harmony and just sounding chord progressions, but<br/>need a broader spectrum of ratios to accommodate the melodic style of<br/>my music. I&apos;ve found great worth in this area, and have explored up<br/>to the 37 limit to good results.  Folks out there in tuning land -<br/>believe your ears, they are the best measure of what&apos;s correct for<br/>your music and style.</p><p>Then on the flip side, I also enjoy many other types of non-rational<br/>tunings.  Shall we begin to discuss Non-Octave ETs?</p><p>Thanks for your reply and good humor here - made me laugh out loud!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2001 2:45:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>shreeswifty wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  I gotta admit Jacky you have got<br/>&gt; &gt; a real knack for making gorgeous tunings.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;  My point exactly<br/>&gt; Mr. Ligon DOES indeed produce very interesting scales.</p><p>They look interesting, I just have&apos;nt had<br/>a chance to check &apos;em out.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a><br/>* <a href="http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley">http://mp3.com/davidbeardsley</a></p></div><h3>Travis Nevels &#x3C;travisn@mindspring.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/17/2001 4:20:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Any tuning defined as &quot;gorgeous&quot; I&apos;d like to find out about.

In other words,<br/>how do we define the boundaries of the octave (if we dare)? And here<br/>I&apos;m talking about the &quot;perceptual octave&quot; that is either stretched or<br/>compressed in the music of multitudes of cultures around the world;<br/>some preferring it wide, some liking it small. Here the exact<br/>mathematical 2/1 of JI and EDOs is now where to be found, and the<br/>music sounds beautiful, and is heard within the cultural context as a<br/>desirable sound in the music.</p><p>The pertinent question being: If the Blackwood/Rapoport/Regener<br/>limits allow that 3/2 may be between 2^4/7 = 685.71 cents and the<br/>upper bound 2^3/5 = 720 cents, then may we use a similar measure to<br/>define a similar boundary for our beloved 2/1?</p><p>Or do we hold it to be a &quot;too sacred object&quot; to follow the model of<br/>large portions of the world in constructing scales, and insist on<br/>keeping it &quot;un-violated&quot;?</p><p>I believe this is somewhat dependent upon the timbres being used, and<br/>the musical context, where melody and rhythmic motion come into play.</p><p>IMHO (and the HO of many I know), this is a great wellspring of<br/>tuning possibilities, nearly untapped where we insist on the<br/>supremacy of an exact 2/1 ratio. My experience, along with many<br/>others who have explored these realms, is that there *is* a band<br/>around the 2/1, which when used in the context of music, is<br/>functionally and perceptually the same as a 2/1, but may have an<br/>energetic and slight beating which is quite lovely. I believe we can<br/>easily look at this as a flexible interval, in the same manner as we<br/>have came to regard the 3/2 as flexible (I should note that on my<br/>piece &quot;Ten Thousand Things&quot; there is singing with a 750 cents &quot;fifth&quot;<br/>which does not shock the ear, but sounds wonderfully energetic,<br/>displacing even here, what we may call a 3/2), without committing any<br/>violation to the sound of tunings, scales and music. We only gain<br/>from this view a boundless freedom. And when we arrive at the doors<br/>of music with all this, we find things are quite a bit more flexible<br/>than we ever imagined while looking through a more theoretical<br/>conception of tunings. At music&apos;s door theory becomes realized and<br/>sometimes discarded for the realities of what the ear, and our<br/>emotions reveal.</p><p>Any thoughts?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/4/2001 3:47:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>According to my harmonic entropy model (with &quot;typical&quot; resolution of<br/>1% assumed), any interval in the range</p><p>667.1&cent; to 736.7&cent;</p><p>is more likely to be heard as a 3:2 ratio than to be heard as any<br/>other ratio.</p><p>Similarly, any interval in the range</p><p>1158.0&cent; to 1242.0&cent;</p><p>is more likely to be heard as a 2:1 ratio than to be heard as any<br/>other ratio.</p></div><h3>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>5/4/2001 4:11:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., paul@s... wrote:<br/>&gt; According to my harmonic entropy model (with &quot;typical&quot; resolution<br/>of<br/>&gt; 1% assumed), any interval in the range<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 667.1&cent; to 736.7&cent;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is more likely to be heard as a 3:2 ratio than to be heard as any<br/>&gt; other ratio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Similarly, any interval in the range<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1158.0&cent; to 1242.0&cent;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is more likely to be heard as a 2:1 ratio than to be heard as any<br/>&gt; other ratio.</p><p>Paul,</p><p>This does show quite a bit flexibility, and for the area of the 3/2<br/>your findings seem to accord well with the Blackwood/Rapoport/Regener<br/>limits.

I refuse to deny myself the broader<br/>reality of tunings outside 5-7 limit JI. My ears grew to need this<br/>over ten years ago - and I *don&apos;t* think 5-7 represents everything<br/>that is valid about scales. How about we think of something other<br/>than &quot;out of tune&quot; relative to our conceptions (and preconceptions)<br/>of what 5-7 limit has to offer? How about the wonders of 11, 13, 17,<br/>19, 23 (one of my favorites), and beyond? Now don&apos;t get me wrong - I<br/>*know* the beauty of 5-7 *intimately*, from years of using it in<br/>actual music compositions - but I can&apos;t let my mind become frozen to<br/>other *equally* beautiful realities. Surely there are better ways to<br/>say things, that will not imply that things beyond 5-7 Limit Ratios<br/>are &quot;out of tune&quot; - where these stretched or compressed intervals<br/>that fit within and neighbor these lower members of the harmonic<br/>series; and thereby, imply by our use of terms, that they may be<br/>invalid. There are myriad of other consonances and near consonances<br/>to be cherished, and should be considered treasures for music<br/>creation, every bit on the level of 5-7 limit JI. I suggest other<br/>metaphors, even though I don&apos;t know what they might be right now. All<br/>I know, is that if we but forth this to those new to tuning theory,<br/>and who may hope to make music with it, then they may have an<br/>unnecessarily warped view early on in the course of their learning.</p><p>Beauty is what we hear folks - never discount this. And yes - beauty<br/>is subjective - and this is exactly why it&apos;s important to your music<br/>with microtonality; you decide with your ears what sounds right, then<br/>you&apos;ll know the most important reality - *your reality*. Your reality<br/>is what has made centuries of music sound beautiful, and will for<br/>centuries to come. &quot;Out of tune&quot; is meaningless, because it implies<br/>good scales and bad scales. I like beating (no not my chest!) - huge<br/>portions of the world like beating. Having beatless intervals is kind<br/>of one dimensional anyhow (a laboratory construct based in<br/>mathematics) - and really a myth of sorts, because no matter what you<br/>do - now get yer faces close to that monitor out there on this one:<br/>you are going to have beating in music where you have overlapping<br/>harmony and melody no matter how MIRACULOUS your scales are. Beating<br/>makes music live. I could never say this if I didn&apos;t have 15 years of<br/>experience wallowing in this reality almost daily, and from the<br/>effort, have enough music to set you down for a week and play<br/>continuous original microtonal music.</p><p>&gt; Well in that case I think Jacky and I are really talking about a<br/>different<br/>&gt; concept. Neither one of us want to be restricted to using only<br/>heptatonic scales.</p><p>Right - nor do I wish to be constricted by conceptions of &quot;out of<br/>tune&quot; relative to this and that. Freedom - Freedom - FREEDOM!! I toss<br/>all these phrases out the window, so I can get on with tuning up my<br/>synths and samplers, and getting wonderful friends to sing in<br/>microtonal compositions without 3/2 and 2/1 or 5-7 limit JI anywhere<br/>to be found.</p><p>Tenderly,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>In 1931 the mathematician and logician Kurt Godel proved that within<br/>a formal system questions exist that are neither provable nor<br/>disprovable on the basis of the axioms that define the system. This<br/>is known as Godel&apos;s Undecidability Theorem. He also showed that in a<br/>sufficiently rich formal system in which decidability of all<br/>questions is required, there will be contradictory statements. This<br/>is known as his Incompleteness Theorem.</p><p>In establishing these theorems Godel showed that there are problems<br/>that cannot be solved by any set of rules or procedures; instead for<br/>these problems one must always extend the set of axioms.
