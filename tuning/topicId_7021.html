If anyone has,<br/>and would like to offer their views and opinions, please feel free to<br/>respond off-list (as this is probably straying to far off-topic). I<br/>really like Brant, and he would seem to me to be well suited for such<br/>an undertaking, so I&apos;m real curious as to whether anyone has heard<br/>it...</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Dan</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/30/1999 3:02:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Actually, I did attend the premiere at Carnegie Hall.  Henry Brant and I had<br/>been speaking and meeting about Ives&apos; &quot;Universe Symphony&quot; and we were<br/>remarking at how this was such a different kind of thing.</p><p>In a way it was a colorizing of a black and white film.  But maybe the<br/>broader strokes needed by an orchestra, especially brass and woodwinds, gave<br/>it a kaleidoscopic effect.  It was certainly enjoyable and one could hear a<br/>lot, but I didn&apos;t hear it as the same piece so much as a take on a piece, a<br/>speculative sand castle.  It was not Ravel and Musorgsky &quot;Pictures at an<br/>Exhibition.&quot;  It was more like a softening of the abstractness that is the<br/>piano when compared to an orchestra.  When I heard Paul Kim play the Thoreau<br/>movement I preferred the piano.</p><p>But hey - Henry Brant did give all who attended the concert a richer<br/>involvement with the &quot;Concord&quot; and he certainly brought us all closer to Ives<br/>through the perspective brought out by the concert.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/1999 8:02:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Johnny Reinhard:]<br/>&gt;Henry Brant and I had been speaking and meeting about Ives&apos; &quot;Universe<br/>Symphony&quot;</p><p>Neat.

Likewise, I&apos;m reading Kirnberger and he says J.S. Bach was the<br/>ultimate expert in intonation.  The keyboard was only a stepping stone from<br/>the mind to the audience.</p><p>But for now, Happy Millennium interval!</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>and all the little folk at the<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music</p></div>
