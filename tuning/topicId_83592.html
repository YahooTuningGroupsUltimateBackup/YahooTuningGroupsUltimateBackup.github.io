This idea gains ground when we<br/>&gt; &gt; consider that truly irrational numbers such as in 12 ET require an infinite<br/>&gt; &gt; number of digits after the decimal point, which neither man nor computer<br/>&gt; &gt; could obtain.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes I agree it&apos;s a good line of thought.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve tried it myself several times.<br/>&gt; I even put several pieces in exteded JI using 19/16 as the minor third,  the<br/>&gt; drei equali piece (posted on this list), the whole lasso piece (unposted)<br/>&gt; and a piece by bach (also unposted).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seemed to work really well at first but l started disliking the sound of it, it sounded tempered to me and gave problems. for instance I&apos;ve found that often the 19/16 in the minor third will become the &quot;fifth to the seventh&quot; in the V7 chord, making a V7 of 1/1 5/4 3/2 57/32. I&apos;ve tried to accept this as correct as well, but in the end it doesn&apos;t work out, the V7 in major mode should be 1/1 5/4 3/2 16/9.<br/>&gt;<br/>Hello Marcel,</p><p>Yes it will tend to sound tempered which is precisely why it shouldn&apos;t give you those types of problems. Not sure what you mean by the &quot;fifth to the seventh&quot;. In the key of C for eg, the 7th degree of G7 is an F note and its 5th is C (which doesn&apos;t belong in G7). Or do you mean that it gives C7 rather than C maj 7?? But either way it would seem that something is amiss in your application. From C maj tonic, the chord should be a maj 7th, successive maj3 min3 maj3. Using small JI the maj 7 should be 15/8. This is because it is semi-symmetric (the maj 3 from 5th degree). Similarly, a minor 7th using 6/5 should be 1/1 6/5 3/2 9/5. Also, given C7 as 1/1 5/4 3/2 57/32, you&apos;re still using 6/5 between 5/4 and 3/2 which might cause problems down the track. But 57/32 is a good flattened 7th anyway and is in fact also closer to tempered than 7/4.</p><p>&quot;Yes 1/1 6/5 3/2 doesn&apos;t have a tonic X/2^ but you assume it should have so, I agree it would make sense but in the end 1/1 6/5 3/2 makes more sense to me than the idea the minor chord should have a tonic X/2^. Many chords don&apos;t have such a tonic.&quot; This is not really an assumption on my part, but is a direct result of 8ve equivalence and proofs relating to the GCD frequency which becomes &quot;1&quot; for all harmonics. Nevertheless it is true that many intervals when heard in isolation don&apos;t have such a tonic but sound like they do. However, the reason for this might be because, as Carl has pointed out, there is an uncertainty around each interval which is why we hear for instance 6/5, 7/6, 19/16 etc...all as &quot;minor thirds&quot;. The problem arises when we start to build larger chords and change key where those uncertainties accumulate and are no longer negligible. In this regard, you should find that 19/16 stays pretty stable if applied properly and consistently. After all, WHY should 6/5 make more sense? It is something close to a minor third from the major third degree, not from the tonic 1,2,4 etc...</p><p>Rick</p><p>Further, (as someone recently said) the idea that the minor sounds &apos;sad&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; because it doesn&apos;t have a tonic sounds a bit poetic to me; tonality requires<br/>&gt; &gt; the tonic to be 8ve to 1 (10:12:15 is the minor triad from the major third<br/>&gt; &gt; degree). Therefore, instead of comparing 19/16 against standard JI and<br/>&gt; &gt; trying to see where it fits, try starting from scratch using this interval.<br/>&gt; &gt; eg 5/4 x 19/16 = 95/64 = 1.484375 or 81/64 x 19/16 = 1539/1024 = 1,502929688<br/>&gt; &gt; (ironically, giving this fifth as even closer to 3/2).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Try a minor third of 32/27.<br/>&gt; 32/27 x 81/64 = exactly 3/2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve found for myself that to use the minor third in music it should be<br/>&gt; either 32/27 or 6/5, both leading in different ways back to 1/1 5/4 3/2.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes 1/1 6/5 3/2 doesn&apos;t have a tonic X/2^ but you assume it should have so,<br/>&gt; I agree it would make sense but in the end 1/1 6/5 3/2 makes more sense to<br/>&gt; me than the idea the minor chord should have a tonic X/2^. Many chords don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have such a tonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The question for me are now different questions.<br/>&gt; I beleive another minor chord can be 1/1 32/27 40/27 (= also 1/1 5/4 27/16)<br/>&gt; Is 1/1 32/27 3/2 also a much used chord and when do you get it?<br/>&gt; Is 1215/1024 also a minor third that can occur. (perhaps here is your tonic<br/>&gt; third? it occurs between for instance 16/9 and 135/64)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The advantage of major triad 64:80:95 and minor 64:76:95 is that they<br/>&gt; &gt; preserve the tonal integrity of both maj and min thirds (i.e. because<br/>&gt; &gt; multiplication is commutative, n x m = m x n). Of course, all other tonal<br/>&gt; &gt; chords such as 7th&apos;s, 9th&apos;s etc...can be obtained by successive application.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like 1/1 5/4 3/2 16/9 20/9 as a ninth chord. (Perhaps also 1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5<br/>&gt; 9/4 but not sure about this one yet.)<br/>&gt; You can continue like this 1/1 5/4 3/2 16/9 20/9 4/3 5/3 2/1<br/>&gt; On white keys: 3/2 15/8 9/4 8/3 10/3 4/1 5/1 6/1<br/>&gt; All you have to do is to accept the minor ii chord is often 1/1 32/27 40/27<br/>&gt; and everything works out like magic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One more thing.

Why is there 4/3 and 5/3?&quot;. Because F is now the tonic, C the fifth (3) and A the major third (5). Technically speaking both intervals represent a key change to the key of F. If we heard each one by itself it would sound like the key of F. But since we&apos;ve been playing in the key of C then our ear still hears C as tonic. In other words, it is due to context. Generally, given x/2^N, then we can always invert the interval 2^(N+1)/x placing the original tonic x in the role of an upper harmonic to fundamental 2^0 = 1.</p><p>As a thought experiment, try thinking of JI intervals only from the tonic and ignoring others. Eg, major triad 4:5:6 has pure maj 3 and perfect 5, while min 3 as 6/5 isn&apos;t an interval from the tonic and is ignored. Similarly, minor triad 16:19:24 has pure min 3 and perfect 5, but maj 3 as 24/19* doesn&apos;t exist for the moment. (After all, tuning consecutive intervals is more of an ET problem. The second interval of a major triad IS the same as a usual minor third in ET etc...but not in JI).<br/>*24/19 = 1.263157895 is in fact close to a major third. But I wouldn&apos;t use it. So why use 6/5 just because it has single digits, despite the fact that it has the wrong tonic? Some JI purists &quot;won&apos;t go too far, but cannot explain why they go SO FAR&quot;. What use is using JI intervals if it is not to preserve precise tonality during the time that tonal chords are played? They fall far short when modulation is needed.</p><p>Next, if you do want to preserve the purity of both major and minor third then you can think of sacrificing the fifth as 3/2. This gives the fifth as 5/4 x 19/16 = 95/64, which is still ok since it is odd/2^6 (and 95/64 = 1.484375 approx 1.5). We then have maj triad 64:80:95 and minor 64:76:95. Or we can repeat the process with maj 3 as 81/64. These intervals will be better for things like modulation and extended 7th, 9th chords etc...that is, places where ET comes into its own. They are particularly better for symmetric chords like diminished eg: (19/16)^2 = 1.41015625, much closer to b5th as sqrt2 = 1.41421356 than (6/5)^2 = 1.44. Similarly,(19/16)^4 = 1.9885...is closer to the 8ve 2 than (6/5)^4 = 2.0736 (the differences being of the order of 0.01 and 0.07 respectively). The list goes on. All of these important issues some historical JI&apos;ists tend to conveniently ignore.</p><p> Regards</p><p>-Rick</p><p>Hi Rick,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marcel, what I&apos;m saying is that in strict JI, as opposed to ET, one needs to<br/>&gt; &gt; make a distinction between tonic and root note. For example, there is a<br/>&gt; &gt; difference between an E minor in the key of E minor and an E minor in the<br/>&gt; &gt; key of C major. In the first case, E is both tonic of the key and the root<br/>&gt; &gt; note of the chord, while in the second, E is the root note but C is the<br/>&gt; &gt; tonic. If C corresponds to 1 in the harmonic series, then 2,4,8,...2^(N =<br/>&gt; &gt; 0,1,2,3...) are also all C notes, 3,6,12,24...are all G notes (perfect<br/>&gt; &gt; fifths)and 5,10,20,40 are all E notes (major thirds or 8ve equivalents).<br/>&gt; &gt; Therefore, 5:6 or 6/5 has 5 or E as root note but not tonic which must be a<br/>&gt; &gt; C here, which means a denominator 2^(N = 0,1,2,3...). (Incidentally, you<br/>&gt; &gt; said that 32/27 also has 2^N. But 32 is in the numerator).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah ok I understand a little better what you ment now.<br/>&gt; But what you&apos;re saying is that in the key of C major only the tonic major<br/>&gt; chord of C E G 1/1 5/4 3/2 confirms to this rule.<br/>&gt; And when you play in C minor you expect this same rule to apply making C Eb<br/>&gt; G 1/1 19/16 3/2.<br/>&gt; But why then in C major key are there not all X/2^ intervals? Why is there<br/>&gt; 4/3 and 5/3?<br/>&gt; And I find skipping a lot of prime harmonics to go to 19 all of a sudden<br/>&gt; very unsatisfactory.<br/>&gt; I think that intervals made up of low prime numbers are more consonant even<br/>&gt; when the numbers are bigger. And they certainately play nicer when you<br/>&gt; combine more intervals into chords that can divide the larger intervals,<br/>&gt; this never happens with a large prime.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Btw i ment that 32/27 is also X/2^ when the chord is inverted. (1/1 32/27<br/>&gt; 27/20 = 1/1 5/4 27/16, 1/1 32/27 3/2 = 1/1 81/64 27/16)<br/>&gt; Perhaps things like 1/1 675/512 405/256 make sense too (1/1 6/5 1024/675) or<br/>&gt; 1/1 21/16 63/40 (1/1 6/5 32/21)<br/>&gt; (expecially like the sound of this when playing 135/128 675/512 405/256 15/8<br/>&gt; - 1/1 5/4 3/2 2/1 etc)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, knowing that in practice minor keys enter on an equal footing with major<br/>&gt; &gt; and must have their own tonic, the question becomes; what is a good minor<br/>&gt; &gt; third ratio where C = 1,2,4...is the tonic (denominator)? The first<br/>&gt; &gt; candidate is 19/16. We have a nice prime number 19 in the numerator which<br/>&gt; &gt; wont factor out, 2^4 in the denominator therefore giving the correct tonic,<br/>&gt; &gt; and an interval which far better approximates a tempered minor third than<br/>&gt; &gt; the traditional 6/5. The next two possibilities are 37/32 or 39/32. But<br/>&gt; &gt; these are either sharper or flatter than the 19 and therefore not as good.<br/>&gt; &gt; Next are 75 or 77 over 64. Again not as good. In fact the next improvement<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t come until 609/512, so in the scheme of things 19/16 seems like the<br/>&gt; &gt; simplest option.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One more thing. You mentioned that you didn&apos;t like this interval because it<br/>&gt; &gt; sounds tempered. But it IS a whole numbered ratio and is not the tempered<br/>&gt; &gt; interval 2^(1/4). The fact that it does not fit into the nicely packaged 5<br/>&gt; &gt; or 7-limit JI&apos;s may just mean that these theories are not sufficiently<br/>&gt; &gt; general to account for minor keys correctly.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The way I was reasoning was that the intervals for the minor third should<br/>&gt; make sense when you change chords and do not expect a comma shift.<br/>&gt; for instance can in 1/1 19/16 3/2 the 1/1 19/16 become the minor third in a<br/>&gt; major chord? this would give a major chord something like 1/1 24/19 3/2 if<br/>&gt; you use a pure fifth.<br/>&gt; Or can in this 1/1 19/16 3/2 the minor third become the minor third that<br/>&gt; makes the 7th in a major chord, which would then become 1/1 5/4 3/2 57/32?<br/>&gt; Also, does this 19/16 tell you anything about music theory and things like<br/>&gt; that?

It is not &quot;my&quot; rule but &quot;the&quot; basis of musical tonality. As I&apos;ve said many times here before, given two waves with frequency ratio a/b, where a and b are whole, then the resulting wave addition will give a frequency corresponding to the GCD. For eg, given frequencies 6 and 9, then 9/3 = 3/2, a = 3, b = 2, therefore 9 will be the 3rd harmonic of tonic 3 and 6 will be the 2nd harmonic. In other words, the resultant wave will be 3Hz. And while we can&apos;t hear this resultant frequency directly, it does make itself felt as musical tonality. We &quot;know&quot; when we hit waves that are 8ve equivalent to this GCD, that they are the tonic. The fact that most music theorists and scientists have systematically overlooked this simple fact for centuries says more about their lack of true understanding of the inner workings of musical harmony than anything truly &quot;scientific&quot;. After all, is not centuries of practising with an orchestra or instrument also counted as a legitimate &quot;scientific experiment&quot;?</p><p>Nor did I &quot;pick&quot; the number 19 at random. Without being egotistical, like all jazz musicians, I have to identify and respond to intervals in a nanosecond, and on a regular basis. So my ears are pretty sharp. I also know that in 12ET minor and major are harmonically equal. It seems obvious now, but it took me ages to work out this interval with just a calculator and guitar. I have since tested it in my microtuning program in many tunings and it sounds just fine.</p><p>For starters, try cutting back to just I, IV and V. For I, take 1:19/16:5/4:3/2 as say C:Eb:E:G. Then apply the same from IV and V, 4/3:19/12:5/3:2 and 3/2:57/32:15/8:9/4, respectively. You will find this is a perfectly valid JI tuning, one among many including this interval, and with the advantage of giving minor chords the priority they are due.

One knows indeed that it is usually supposed that preparation and resolution are only used to accustom the ear , beforehand and &quot;subsequently&quot; as one might say, to the dissonant sound by making it hear in consonances. And Euler<br/>concludes:<br/>&quot;It is commonly claimed that one makes use in music only of proportions made up of these three prime numbers 2, 3 and 5 and the great Leibniz 24 has already remarked that in music we have still not learned to count beyond 5; which is also incontestably true in the instruments tuned according to principles of the harmony. But, if my conjecture has validity, one can say that in the compositions one already counts up to 7 and that the ear thereby is already accustomed to it. 25 It is a new kind of music, one that has begun to show use and which was unkown to the ancients. In this kind the chord 4, 5, 6, 7 is the most complete harmony, since it contains numbers 2, 3, 5 and 7; but it is more complicated than the common triad which contains only numbers 2, 3 and 5. If it is a perfection in composition, perhaps one will try to carry the instruments to the same degree.&quot; [OO, 3a, I, 515]</p><p>References:</p><p>Download an facsimile of Euler&apos;s original publication from the site:<br/><a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E033.html">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E033.html</a><br/>Especialliy see for the above mentioned 7-limit consonances:<br/><a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E314.pdf">http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E314.pdf</a><br/>(written in French).</p><p>You can buy an 1739 original &quot;First Edition&quot;:<br/><a href="http://search.abaa.org/dbp2/book336685744.html">http://search.abaa.org/dbp2/book336685744.html</a><br/>actual &quot;Price: USD 2,500.00 $&quot;<br/>or simply study the less expensive:<br/><a href="http://www.rev.net/~aloe/music/7limit.html">http://www.rev.net/~aloe/music/7limit.html</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimal_comma">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimal_comma</a><br/>induced intervals.</p><p>bye<br/>A.S.</p></div><h3><a id=83730 href="#83730">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2009 7:17:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;then the resulting wave addition will give a frequency corresponding to<br/>the GCD.

For eg, given frequencies 6 and 9, then 9/3 = 3/2, a = 3, b =<br/>&gt; 2, therefore 9 will be the 3rd harmonic of tonic 3 and 6 will be the<br/>&gt; 2nd harmonic.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just a general comment about GCD&apos;s and matching the harmonic series.  While this is a very mathematically sound idea...if you try actually playing an x/16 harmonic series with an instrument I&apos;m pretty sure you will find it sounds rather mechanical-sounding with virtually all beating being exactly at the same rate.  It presents a similar problem to keyboardist playing every key at a fixed &quot;mathematically perfect&quot; velocity.<br/>&gt;     So while I agree x/c (where c is a constant...the most widely used example being the x/16 harmonic series fragment) is a perfectly aligned harmonic series and good &quot;limit&quot;...it&apos;s a limit made to be approached but sounds less than perfect if you hit it dead-on (and thus up to about 15 cents of tempering can actually be desirable to preserve a soft/flowing/non-mechanic sense of beating on a 1-2 out of 7 notes in a scale and up to 7 cents tempering on the rest, for example).  Not to say 12TET, for example, is good...but that one of its advantages over a straight harmonic series, for example, is that it creates this relaxed/slow beating.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;<br/>Yeah I agree that the pure harmonic series applied mechanically can get rather boring, although there are theoretically an infinite number of harmonics to choose from (and some of these can sound pretty weird). This is why I&apos;m interested in the idea of &quot;almost&quot; periodic functions and the &quot;leverage&quot; around each interval as in Harmonic entropy. (How far can we go before a major third sounds out of tune rather than becoming a minor third etc...? i.e. how near is &quot;almost&quot;?). Still, we can&apos;t just spiral off into infinity without some reference point, and fanatical avante garde stuff can become equally boring in its unpredictability because we don&apos;t &quot;care&quot; for one note over another. (I remember reading Wagner who said that tonal keys are like families, modulation like adolescence, and the climax is a form of maturity where the prodigal son returns home but with a new understanding). Having composed a symphony myself (just for myself), I realised that you waste nothing. This part you rejected here can come in there with a transposition etc...</p><p>OTOH, the maths of GCD is much more elegant than just applying the counting numbers. This is because if we form a GCD frequency out of whole numbers a/b with b not equal to 1 and take the harmonic series of both sine frequencies then we get a harmonic series of GCD&apos;s. Each wave has the same shape (tone) as the original while the frequencies increase harmonically i.e. (a + 2a + 3a + ...) + (b + 2b + 3b + ...) = (a + b) + 2(a + b) + 3(a + b) + ...(although this is an abbreviation for adding sine waves). Then this frequency can be added with another, then another, and so on ad musicum.</p><p>For 12 TET beating, an example that immediately springs to mind is the wonderful closed voicings of the jazz pianist Bill Evans.</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83735 href="#83735">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2009 8:38:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Then it&apos;s second inversion, isn&apos;t it?

Thus, idea&apos;s like comma shifts etc...needed to come into play because intervals had to share a double function, one as notes in chords and another as notes between keys. And once the instruments were tuned, the results were &quot;set in stone&quot;. Of course, 12 EDO is a good solution to this as each note has 12 equal functions (though sometimes this distinction is now overlooked).</p><p>However, in the computer world, we have been freed from some of these limitations. When I said that 6/5 does not have the correct tonic, I was speaking strictly in the first sense of intervals within chords, not between keys. Nowadays we can retune for each individual chord during the time duration of that chord. And for tonal chords, THIS is where JI will sound great. But for modulation intervals and symmetric chords like diminished, I&apos;m 99% sure that ET&apos;s will sound best here. Therefore, since comma&apos;s don&apos;t exist in ET&apos;s, and are not an issue for tonal chords regarded from the tonic, then problem solved!</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83738 href="#83738">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2009 9:42:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; G7th as 9/8:4/3:3/2:15/8 (again including 32/27 but where 9/8 is now the seventh).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Rick, is there a mistake there?

One knows indeed that it is usually supposed that preparation and resolution are only used to accustom the ear , beforehand and &quot;subsequently&quot; as one might say, to the dissonant sound by making it hear in consonances. And Euler<br/>&gt; concludes:<br/>&gt; &quot;It is commonly claimed that one makes use in music only of proportions made up of these three prime numbers 2, 3 and 5 and the great Leibniz 24 has already remarked that in music we have still not learned to count beyond 5; which is also incontestably true in the instruments tuned according to principles of the harmony. But, if my conjecture has validity, one can say that in the compositions one already counts up to 7 and that the ear thereby is already accustomed to it. 25 It is a new kind of music, one that has begun to show use and which was unkown to the ancients. In this kind the chord 4, 5, 6, 7 is the most complete harmony, since it contains numbers 2, 3, 5 and 7; but it is more complicated than the common triad which contains only numbers 2, 3 and 5. If it is a perfection in composition, perhaps one will try to carry the instruments to the same degree.&quot; [OO, 3a, I, 515]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; References:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Download an facsimile of Euler&apos;s original publication from the site:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E033.html">http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E033.html</a><br/>&gt; Especialliy see for the above mentioned 7-limit consonances:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E314.pdf">http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E314.pdf</a><br/>&gt; (written in French).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can buy an 1739 original &quot;First Edition&quot;:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://search.abaa.org/dbp2/book336685744.html">http://search.abaa.org/dbp2/book336685744.html</a><br/>&gt; actual &quot;Price: USD 2,500.00 $&quot;<br/>&gt; or simply study the less expensive:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.rev.net/~aloe/music/7limit.html">http://www.rev.net/~aloe/music/7limit.html</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimal_comma">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septimal_comma</a><br/>&gt; induced intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; bye<br/>&gt; A.S.<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks A.S.,</p><p>Allot of reading there.

The upward extension of triads in bebop follows two very different principles, both inherited from African practices. One could be called &quot;the central African model&quot; of piling thirds on top of each other; the other principle is the selective use of upper harmonics, an auditory experience in African-American traditions transmitted through the blues. Because higher partials cannot be played exactly on a piano, the pianist chooses optimal approximations. Upper partials are what Charlie Parker must have heard internally when he tried to work out something new over &quot;Cherokee.&quot; Thus even within the tuning of the European tonal system, C (9) in bebop and earlier blues-based jazz can be taken as a column of harmonics incorporating partials 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9; and its cognate, [C.sup.+11], the augmented eleventh chord, is but a representation of the harmonic series up to partial 11. Because that partial stands at 551 cents, its pitch value cannot be played accurately on a keyboard instrument; soft is used to represent it. That note fulfills its task much better than f, because f would simply corroborate the diatonic scale....<br/>However, because partials-derived pitch patterns can only be objectified approximately on a piano or guitar, the analysis of such chords boils down to this question: Which note represents which partial? In the key of C over the tonic chord, partial 7 can be rendered as b, although it is 31 cents lower than the tempered value; partial 9 at 204 cents is virtually identical with a d, while partial 11 at 551 cents is rendered as f# on a piano, and partial 13 (at 840 cents) as a[flat]. Remarkably, when jazz pianists began to lay out the partials-based cluster chords, they also followed the order of partials in the natural harmonic series, from bass to treble, thereby revealing the underlying (often unconscious) auditory basis....<br/>Thus, some of the cluster chords in bebop are simply the nearest possible representations of selected partials from the natural harmonic series, extended high up. The famous flatted fifth in bebop represents partial 11; to make that clear, it is often struck together with its fundamental, for example, f# with c, or g with c[sharp] to be resolved into c. The accurate intonation of the bebop flatted fifth would be 551 cents; the approximation played on a piano is at 600 cents.

The problem with these, however, is that they don&apos;t explain minor that well. And when it comes to a 7th chord, the aug 11th is called a flat-5th because it is at the expense of the fifth (aug or #11 requires maj 7, which is a chord that includes the perfect fifth). The so-called blue notes are the 7th, the b5, and min3 played against a major chord (7(b5#9) type harmony), not necessarily in the chord. Honestly, I think that our extended chords have more to do with stacking alternate maj and min thirds in ET rather than anything to do with the harmonic series up to 11 or 13. So the problem comes back to finding a decent minor third ratio with the correct tonic i.e. 19/16.

Much later (Debussy, Skriabin...) they were chromatized,<br/>&gt; altered, especially when used in subdominant function (for example 11<br/>&gt; +/5+) and exploited on all chromatic steps in the key.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; which is a chord that includes the perfect fifth). The so-called<br/>&gt; &gt; blue notes are the 7th, the b5,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But in blues scale can&apos;t be diminished 5th,  only augmented 4th. Only<br/>&gt; that way the rule of alternate chromatic scale is kept. So blues<br/>&gt; scale can be for example C-(D)-Eb-F-F#-G-(A)-Bb-(B), where notes in<br/>&gt; parenthesis could be omitted. This scale can be played over all basic<br/>&gt; chords used in blues pattern, or transposed according to chord<br/>&gt; changes. This depends on performer&apos;s attitude.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and min3 played against a major chord (7(b5#9) type harmony), not<br/>&gt; &gt; necessarily in the chord. Honestly, I think that our extended<br/>&gt; &gt; chords have more to do with stacking alternate maj and min thirds<br/>&gt; &gt; in ET<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then such major chord would be derived from Lydian (C-E-G-B-D-F#-A)<br/>&gt; and it will be C13/11+/7maj which is wrong as classical harmony<br/>&gt; derives it from Mixolydian, as 13th chord was originally used only in<br/>&gt; dominant function (check Liszt&apos;s Love dream No. 3 for example). So<br/>&gt; for C major it is G-B-D-F-A-C-E (G13 - normal diatonics without<br/>&gt; altered notes). Besides in the end there will be two small thirds (F#-<br/>&gt; A, A-C).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And keeping your rule of alternating major and minor thirds we get<br/>&gt; for minor key C-Eb-G-Bb-D-F-A, derived from Dorian, which is again<br/>&gt; far from reality, as 13th chord for minor key is build again on<br/>&gt; dominant and for C minor key it will be G-B-D-F-Ab-C-Eb (G13-/9-),<br/>&gt; based on harmonic C minor - you see we get irregular pattern of major<br/>&gt; and minor thirds. Check Chopin&apos;s Nocturno C minor op. 48/1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; rather than anything to do with the harmonic series up to 11 or 13.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 11+ could be influenced by 11th harmonics, because normal 11th chord<br/>&gt; based on major dominant chord has perfect 11th, then third is omitted<br/>&gt; to avoid dissonance. Augmented 11th together with minor 7th could<br/>&gt; imitate harmonic series, which is often case in the music of Debussy,<br/>&gt; Ravel, Skriabin, Stravinskij, Bart&oacute;k... also Gershwin, pop and jazz<br/>&gt; music since 20ies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And augmented 11th together with augmented 5th is essential chord<br/>&gt; beloved by impressionists for its power to destroy tonality, as it&apos;s<br/>&gt; made from whole-tone scale (C-E-G#-Bb-D-F#).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nothing to say about chords like 13/11+/9+/9- (C-E-G-Bb-Db-D#-F#-A),<br/>&gt; 13/11+/9+ (C-E-G-Bb-D#-F#-A),  13/11+/9- (C-E-G-Bb-Db-F#-A), 11+/9+<br/>&gt; (C-E-G-Bb-D#-F#), 11+/9- (C-E-G-Bb-Db-F#) all of them opening door to<br/>&gt; the huge world of diminished scale and bitonality explored by many<br/>&gt; New music and jazz composers (just to name Skriabin and Messiaen).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forr&oacute;<br/>&gt;<br/>Hi Daniel,</p><p>Almost everything you say here is true, but you&apos;re taking me way out of context and wrongly concluding that I don&apos;t know my harmony or history. In the original statement of this thread (I think to Marcel) I was talking about minor third as 19/16 being a far more viable option for minor tonality in all extant 12 tone harmony than 6/5 or 32/27 etc which all have the wrong tonic. I was pointing out that while 6/5 might sound good in simple triads considered in isolation, that 19/16 explains much better extended four note or symmetric chords than successive applications of 6/5 etc which will accumulate wrong tonics over time. With A.S it became more about trying to explain these extended 4-note chords of modern jazz harmony in terms of the harmonic series and traditional precedences to be found in Euler. I then pointed out that the 7th in dom7 chords might be better approx by 3/2 x 19/16 than the 7th harmonic (and then as an aside that the same could be said of 13 chords and the 13th harmonic as 13/8).</p><p>For the record, C E G B D F# A is called maj7(#11) because it is the #11, not the b5 which comes in on dominant chords, like you said. Of course this Lydian tonality often replaces the tonic Ionian during the time it is played for added colour.</p><p>For altered chords (on the dominant) we can have flat, sharp, or normal fifths and ninths, but we&apos;d never play altered fifths or ninths with the natural fifths or ninths because it sounds horrible. Over A7alt, the scale we&apos;d usually play is a Bb jazz melodic minor where the maj 6 and 7 are played both up and down, essentially a Bb min maj 7 chord with A root. Of course we can play on this chord as if it were a tonic. As you said, &quot;And augmented 11th together with augmented 5th is essential chord beloved by impressionists for its power to destroy tonality, as it&apos;s made from whole-tone scale (C-E-G#-Bb-D-F#)&quot;. And as you see, there is no fifth present. There is also no E in Bb min maj 7 (i.e. A7alt).</p><p>Another common dom chord is 13th, so called because we don&apos;t want it to clash with the b7. This goes with a jazz dim scale, semitone-tone-semi starting from the root note of the chord. We can add all the altered 5ths and 9ths except +5 which clashes. This agrees with what you said that &quot;Nothing to say about chords like 13/11+/9+/9-&quot; and so on. Again, notice that there&apos;s no +5 with the 13.</p><p>However, this altered harmony is different than blues harmony where I IV and V are all 7th chords and we CAN play the blue notes b3 and b5 over the maj3 and perfect 5. It can be called b5 now because of cliche&apos;d blues phrases such as 5 b5 4 b3 3. But since the scale C Eb F Gb G Bb contains both 4th and 5th, then the naming is up for grabs. This is often a point of confusion. Besides, blues players themselves couldn&apos;t care less what its called, which also says something. So when you say &quot;Normal full 11+ chord has perfect fifth, and<br/>&gt; minor 7th, like C-E-G-Bb-D-F#&quot;, you too are confusing the two worlds. Notwithstanding serialism etc..., for C root we choose F# with B OR Gb with Bb. Why? Because just as the diminished chord can go up or down min 3rds and remain the same, or the aug by maj 3rds, so too the 7(b5) can go up or down b7. This is because they are the same chord: G7(b5) = G:B:Db:F = Db7(b5) = Db:F:G:B. Adding a D natural or Ab confuses this harmonic function with a flat 9 which is diminished based (i.e. G7(b9) has Ab dim harmonicity, but Db7(b9) doesn&apos;t lead to C tonic like Db7(b5)).</p><p>Finally, as you know C Eb G Bb D F A is called minor 11, min69, depending upon extension. Of course this is Dorian. But my original point was that this chord stands on equal ground as the maj7(#11). And if we assume that there is a rational JI counterpart, then the adoption of 19/16 in EVERY SINGLE ONE of these contexts will give far better approximations to the tempered intervals than 6/5, 32/27. Eg: 3/2 x 19/16 = 57/32 for b7. Then 57/32 x 5/4 = 285/128, 285/256 gives a new whole-tone etc...Or since the fifth is often the first to go in tonality, 5/4 x 19/16 = 95/64 gives a reasonable fifth with the correct tonic, as does 81/64 x 19/16 = 1539/1024 = 1.5029...(which is actually closer to 3/2). For bitonal/atonal symmetries, (19/16)^2 = 1.4101, a better JI sqrt2 than (6/5)^2 = 36/25 = 1.44. The list goes on.</p><p>So you see that I&apos;m not trying to find new harmonies here but trying to explain the old ones correctly in terms of upper harmonics. I&apos;m saying that 12 tone harmony has created new approaches to JI and is not necessarily just a bad compromise to trad JI. And I&apos;ll bet that these (my) intervals also sound closer to the whole-tone music of Debussy, the 12 tone of Shoernberg, Berg, and Webern, or the diminished scale and bitonality explored by Scriabin (spelt with a C not K btw) and Messiaen, than low-limit JI.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83776 href="#83776">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2009 8:02:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Andreas Sparschuh&quot; &lt;a_sparschuh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Andreas Sparschuh&quot; &lt;a_sparschuh@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; So the problem comes back<br/>&gt; &gt; to finding a decent minor third ratio<br/>&gt; &gt; with the correct tonic i.e. 19/16.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Ok Rick,<br/>&gt; already Erasthostenes introduced 19-limit interval-ratios in his<br/>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachord">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachord</a><br/>&gt; &quot;Eratosthenes chromatic tetrachord &#x9;20:19, 19:18, 6:5&quot;<br/>&gt; and Boethius considered just that 19/16 the context of:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://eamusic.dartmouth.edu/~larry/published_articles/divisions_of_the_tetrachord/chapter2.pdf">http://eamusic.dartmouth.edu/~larry/published_articles/divisions_of_the_tetrachord/chapter2.pdf</a><br/>&gt; Quote<br/>&gt; p.7<br/>&gt; &quot;Boethius&apos;s tuning for the tetrachord...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; chromatic: 256/243 &acirc;Â€&cent; 81/76 &acirc;Â€&cent; 19/16<br/>&gt; ... p.8<br/>&gt; ... 19/16 is virtually the same size<br/>&gt; as the Pythagorean minor third, 32/27.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consider the quotient among them:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 513/512 = (19/16):(32/27)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; that is labeled as<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/intervals.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/intervals.html</a><br/>&gt; &quot;513/512  undevicesimal comma, Boethius&apos; comma&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and is examined in<br/>&gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm</a><br/>&gt; &quot;The difference between 2187/2048 and 81/76 is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;2187:2048 &#x9;= &#x9;&#x9;2^-11 &#x9;3^7<br/>&gt; &Acirc;&cedil; &#x9;81:76 &#x9;= &#x9;- &#x9;2^-2 &#x9;3^4 &#x9;19^-1<br/>&gt; &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;___ &#x9;___ &#x9;___<br/>&gt; &#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;2^-9 &#x9;3^3 &#x9;19^1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or 513:512 [= 3.378 cents].<br/>&gt; Thus Marchetto&apos;s 81/76 &quot;Diatonic Semitone&quot;<br/>&gt; of 3 &quot;dieses&quot; is indeed very close to the<br/>&gt; &quot;apotome&quot; to which he equated it.<br/>&gt; Surprisingly, however, it is even closer to the 5-limit larger semitone, which a few centuries later also became known as the &quot;diatonic&quot;.

This to me is made all the more surprising when we consider that it is the first minor third to have prime/2^N, which seems so basic considering 2/1, 3/2, 5/4, and 9/8. I wonder why that is? Is it because it needed ET to draw our attention to it, but since it wasn&apos;t recognised historically it didn&apos;t find a place in the pantheon of JI intervals? Poor lonely 19/16.

I was pointing out that while<br/>&gt; 6/5 might sound good in simple triads considered in isolation, that<br/>&gt; 19/16 explains much better extended four note or symmetric chords<br/>&gt; than successive applications of 6/5 etc which will accumulate wrong<br/>&gt; tonics over time. With A.S it became more about trying to explain<br/>&gt; these extended 4-note chords of modern jazz harmony in terms of the &gt; harmonic series and traditional precedences to be found in Euler. I<br/>&gt; then pointed out that the 7th in dom7 chords might be better approx<br/>&gt; by 3/2 x 19/16 than the 7th harmonic (and then as an aside that the<br/>&gt; same could be said of 13 chords and the 13th harmonic as 13/8).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the record, C E G B D F# A is called maj7(#11) because it is<br/>&gt; the #11, not the b5 which comes in on dominant chords, like you said.<br/>&gt;<br/>I don&apos;t understand quite well what you wanted to say here... BTW I<br/>can imagine major chord C11/9/7maj/5-, for example. More interesting<br/>would be C11/9-/7maj/5-, as there will be inverted symmetry between C-<br/>E-B (47 in number of halftones) and Gb-Db-F (74)...<br/>&gt; Of course this Lydian tonality often replaces the tonic Ionian<br/>&gt; during the time it is played for added colour.<br/>&gt;<br/>It depends on the context, but I don&apos;t see any reason why it should<br/>be so. But everything is possible if it&apos;s intentional.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For altered chords (on the dominant) we can have flat, sharp, or<br/>&gt; normal fifths and ninths,<br/>&gt;<br/>If you mean diminished, augmented or perfect fifth, diminished,<br/>augmented and major ninth, then terminology is OK :-) Not always<br/>there&apos;s flat or sharp on those altered notes. That&apos;s the reason why I<br/>always use neutral &quot;-&quot; and &quot;+&quot; for such alterations - it&apos;s universal<br/>system independent on keys.<br/>&gt; but we&apos;d never play altered fifths or ninths with the natural<br/>&gt; fifths or ninths because it sounds horrible.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes, it can&apos;t be combined. But we can have double altered chords,<br/>like C5+/5- (and all extensions), or C9-/9+, and with 7maj also 13-/13<br/>+ is possible. Very rarely used...</p><p>&gt; Over A7alt, the scale we&apos;d usually play is a Bb jazz melodic minor<br/>&gt; where the maj 6 and 7 are played both up and down, essentially a Bb<br/>&gt; min maj 7 chord with A root. Of course we can play on this chord as<br/>&gt; if it were a tonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>I personally don&apos;t like those fixed simplistic assignments &quot;certain<br/>chord/certain scale&quot;, as scale used should depend more on the musical<br/>context, not much on the chord structure itself.  There&apos;s always more<br/>possibilities, the most extreme is bitonality.</p><p>&gt; As you said, &quot;And augmented 11th together with augmented 5th is<br/>&gt; essential chord beloved by impressionists for its power to destroy<br/>&gt; tonality, as it&apos;s made from whole-tone scale (C-E-G#-Bb-D-F#)&quot;. And<br/>&gt; as you see, there is no fifth present.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I see here one augmented fifth in root chord :-)<br/>&gt; Another common dom chord is 13th, so called because we don&apos;t want<br/>&gt; it to clash with the b7.<br/>&gt;<br/>I don&apos;t follow you here...</p><p>&gt; However, this altered harmony is different than blues harmony where<br/>&gt; I IV and V are all 7th chords and we CAN play the blue notes b3 and<br/>&gt; b5 over the maj3 and perfect 5. It can be called b5 now because of<br/>&gt; cliche&apos;d blues phrases such as 5 b5 4 b3 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>It can&apos;t be called diminished 5th even when used melodically. Rules<br/>valid for altered chromatic scale allows only rising the fourth, not<br/>lowering 5th.</p><p>&gt; But since the scale C Eb F Gb G Bb contains both 4th and 5th, then<br/>&gt; the naming is up for grabs.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Proper spelling is C-Eb-F-F#-G-Bb.</p><p>&gt; This is often a point of confusion. Besides, blues players<br/>&gt; themselves couldn&apos;t care less what its called, which also says<br/>&gt; something. So when you say &quot;Normal full 11+ chord has perfect<br/>&gt; fifth, and<br/>&gt; &gt; minor 7th, like C-E-G-Bb-D-F#&quot;, you too are confusing the two<br/>&gt; worlds.<br/>&gt;<br/>There&apos;s only one world. I&apos;m living proof as a musician. And harmonic<br/>rules are valid even in jazz music. It can&apos;t be changed by improper<br/>use from the side of uneducated jazz amateurs.</p><p>&gt; Notwithstanding serialism etc..., for C root we choose F# with B OR<br/>&gt; Gb with Bb.<br/>&gt;<br/>I don&apos;t understand what you mean, if not just more comfortable<br/>reading of the score. But if harmonic rules ask it, we must combine<br/>flats and sharps.</p><p>&gt; Why? Because just as the diminished chord can go up or down min<br/>&gt; 3rds and remain the same, or the aug by maj 3rds, so too the 7(b5)<br/>&gt; can go up or down b7.<br/>&gt;<br/>Minor 7th? That must be wrong. You mean tritone probably, then yes<br/>(when we ignore necessary enharmonic changes).</p><p>&gt; This is because they are the same chord: G7(b5) = G:B:Db:F = Db7<br/>&gt; (b5) = Db:F:G:B.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Wrong enharmonic spelling: it must be Db-F-Abb-Cb, otherwise it&apos;s not<br/>derived from the seventh chord. When you write Db-F-G-B it&apos;s just<br/>second inversion of G-B-Db-F.</p><p>&gt; Adding a D natural or Ab confuses this harmonic function with a<br/>&gt; flat 9 which is diminished based (i.e. G7(b9) has Ab dim<br/>&gt; harmonicity, but Db7(b9) doesn&apos;t lead to C tonic like Db7(b5)).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Don&apos;t understand. Such chords like 9-/5- are in use, of course, why<br/>not? It gives Phrygian or Gipsy major scale character.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Finally, as you know C Eb G Bb D F A is called minor 11, min69,<br/>&gt;<br/>11 and 9/6 chords are totally different.</p><p>&gt; depending upon extension. Of course this is Dorian. But my original<br/>&gt; point was that this chord stands on equal ground as the maj7(#11).<br/>&gt; And if we assume that there is a rational JI counterpart, then the<br/>&gt; adoption of 19/16 in EVERY SINGLE ONE of these contexts will give<br/>&gt; far better approximations to the tempered intervals than 6/5,<br/>&gt; 32/27. Eg: 3/2 x 19/16 = 57/32 for b7. Then 57/32 x 5/4 = 285/128,<br/>&gt; 285/256 gives a new whole-tone etc...Or since the fifth is often<br/>&gt; the first to go in tonality, 5/4 x 19/16 = 95/64 gives a reasonable<br/>&gt; fifth with the correct tonic, as does 81/64 x 19/16 = 1539/1024 =<br/>&gt; 1.5029...(which is actually closer to 3/2). For bitonal/atonal<br/>&gt; symmetries, (19/16)^2 = 1.4101, a better JI sqrt2 than (6/5)^2 =<br/>&gt; 36/25 = 1.44. The list goes on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>High math to me. In this purely theoretical disputation I don&apos;t<br/>consider microtones or tempering. Just standard 12 ET.</p><p>&gt; So you see that I&apos;m not trying to find new harmonies here but<br/>&gt; trying to explain the old ones correctly in terms of upper harmonics.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Not everything in classical thirdal harmony can be explained from<br/>upper harmonics, but there&apos;s high probability it was derived from it.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m saying that 12 tone harmony has created new approaches to JI<br/>&gt; and is not necessarily just a bad compromise to trad JI. And I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; bet that these (my) intervals also sound closer to the whole-tone<br/>&gt; music of Debussy, the 12 tone of Shoernberg, Berg, and Webern, or<br/>&gt; the diminished scale and bitonality explored by Scriabin (spelt<br/>&gt; with a C not K btw) and Messiaen, than low-limit JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Rick<br/>&gt;</p><p>Skriabin was Russian composer (besides other languages I&apos;m fluent in<br/>Russian), so his name can be transliterated from azbuka in more ways<br/>to the other languages.

Azbuka has also special character<br/>for &quot;ia&quot; (or &quot;ya&quot;), that&apos;s another reason for different<br/>transliterations.

It is incredibly<br/>&gt; close to 19/16 btw (much closer than 32/27).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marcel<br/>&gt;<br/>Howdy Marcel,</p><p>In traditional classical major tonality where I and IV are maj triads and only V is 7th, your tuning will work fine. Inverted 4/3 and 3/2 for 7th of dominant is perfect and no further complication like introducing &quot;19/16&quot; etc. is needed. And for key changes to other maj keys I suppose you can just retune.</p><p>In Jazz we rarely play straight triads. Unless we are playing pop or country, we would play 7ths of some sort. The reason for this is because of the mov&apos;t of what are called &quot;Guide Tones&quot;. The rule is that, as we cycle, 7ths become 3rds and 3rds become 7ths. Eg Cmaj7 to Fmaj7, C E G B becomes C E F A. The 7th of C, here a maj 7 B, moves to the 3rd of F, here a major 3rd A, while the 3rd of C (E) becomes the 7th of F (also E). Or we could turn the C into a dominant giving Bb to A, or F7 giving E to Eb. As an exercise on a piano, start with C E G B, move top two notes down the white keys for F maj 7, then the bottom two for B half dim, top two for E min 7, etc...till you reach C maj 7 again. You can modify chords along the way to become dom 7ths instead of min 7 etc...Observe also that we can play C major over the entire progression giving all the modes in their correct place.</p><p>Obviously your JI tuning will begin to break down over such progressions, which is where 19/16 might come in.</p><p>Given 1/1 32/27 3/2 the Pyth minor triad (switched Pyth major), the first (bottom) note seems to serve a double function as both 27 and 2. Since 2 overrides 27, then what you say is probably true i.e. we would here the bottom note as the tonic because of the presence of the perfect fifth.</p><p>Try this on a piano. C7 to F7 to Bb7 to Eb7 etc...Observe that the interval b/w 3rd and 7th (the guide tones) is a tritone and that these go down chromatically. Now cut out the fifths altogether. Eg Left hand goes C F Bb Eb... and right hand goes E-Bb, Eb-A, D-Ab, Db-G,...So you see that in this harmony at least, the fifths are not important. It is the guide tones that identify the chords. It is for reasons like this that I sensed that preserving both major and minor thirds was more important than preserving fifths (which are present as a strong harmonic anyway).</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83788 href="#83788">ðŸ”—</a>William Gard &#x3C;billygard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2009 9:45:09 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Marcel de Velde &lt;m.develde@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; And they really try to sing the harmonic 7th for the dominant 7th chord in<br/>&gt; major mode?<br/>&gt; If so I&apos;m very surprised by this as my ear doesn&apos;t accept the harmonic 7th<br/>&gt; here.<br/>&gt; G 3/2  B 15/8  D 9/4  F 21/8<br/>&gt; Instead G 3/2  B 15/8  D 9/4  F 8/3 sounds perfect to me and makes perfect<br/>&gt; sense in major mode of 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>I mainly was correcting the text that said the 7th harmonic is sharper than the ET minor 7th.</p><p>By the way, if you put the dominant 7th on the 3rd degree (EG#BD), in the JI major scale, using the 25/16 tuning for the G#, the 7th would be an even wider 9/5.

Therefore at least one more significant figure is required throughout the calculations, meaning that numbers must be represented to at least a precision of 0.00001 or 0.001%.

Or re-voiced it could be a D13(#9), perhaps with the 7th C in the bass. As for your second chord, I&apos;m not exactly sure what you mean since there is no E note. (Two successive semitones C B Db will always be tonally ambiguous).</p><p>Of course this Lydian tonality often replaces the tonic Ionian<br/>during the time it is played for added colour.</p><p>It depends on the context, but I don&apos;t see any reason why it should<br/>be so. But everything is possible if it&apos;s intentional.</p><p>Because it goes without saying that you&apos;d play Lydian over the fourth degree chord. Naturally, intentionality is almost everything as you said. However, you and I already know the groundwork of harmony and so can recognise when something might be new and interesting, intentionally original. I just get annoyed when dilettante&apos;s use the &quot;artistic 5th amendment&quot; and try to cover their ignorance by screaming &quot;I have the right to be free and modern&quot;.</p><p>For altered chords (on the dominant) we can have flat, sharp, or<br/>normal fifths and ninths,</p><p>If you mean diminished, augmented or perfect fifth, diminished,<br/>augmented and major ninth, then terminology is OK :-) Not always<br/>there&apos;s flat or sharp on those altered notes. That&apos;s the reason why I<br/>always use neutral &quot;-&quot; and &quot;+&quot; for such alterations - it&apos;s universal<br/>system independent on keys.</p><p>When reading most jazz charts at a live gig where things go by quickly, &quot;+&quot; means augmented 5 and occurs either as a dominant 7 chord or a &quot;rising 5&quot; (eg James Bond for minor, or raining in my heart for major). To write a &quot;+9&quot; or &quot;+7&quot; for eg would read #5 with ninth or seventh.</p><p>but we&apos;d never play altered fifths or ninths with the natural<br/>fifths or ninths because it sounds horrible.</p><p>Yes, it can&apos;t be combined. But we can have double altered chords,<br/>like C5+/5- (and all extensions), or C9-/9+, and with 7maj also 13-/13<br/>+ is possible. Very rarely used...</p><p>Yes double altered&apos;s are technically just altered&apos;s. It is often left up to the player as to choice since no combo&apos;s will clash. But 7maj also 13-/13+ would usually occur in the rising/falling 5, for if 13- was played for some time the chord becomes maj from 6- degree (maj 3rds being the stronger interval), while 13+ is 7 and would sound awful with maj7, so very rare.<br/>&gt;<br/>Over A7alt, the scale we&apos;d usually play is a Bb jazz melodic minor<br/>where the maj 6 and 7 are played both up and down, essentially a Bb<br/>min maj 7 chord with A root. Of course we can play on this chord as<br/>if it were a tonic.</p><p>I personally don&apos;t like those fixed simplistic assignments &quot;certain<br/>chord/certain scale&quot;, as scale used should depend more on the musical<br/>context, not much on the chord structure itself.  There&apos;s always more<br/>possibilities, the most extreme is bitonality.</p><p>Well of course there are options in the choice of original chords and scales which enter the world together. And there is nothing simplistic about music. I personally don&apos;t like those fixed simplistic assignments such as &quot;scales&quot; because it is like studying the alphabet to learn to become a writer, which is only necessary as a first step. And bitonality only has meaning against the backdrop of tonality i.e chords, not ordered notes such as scales. It is in the choice of chords that bitonality takes off. For one simple example, using diminished chords as dominant and coming out in different keys, or even two keys at once.<br/>&gt;<br/>As you said, &quot;And augmented 11th together with augmented 5th is<br/>essential chord beloved by impressionists for its power to destroy<br/>tonality, as it&apos;s made from whole-tone scale (C-E-G#-Bb-D-F#)&quot;. And<br/>as you see, there is no fifth present.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>I see here one augmented fifth in root chord :-)<br/>Another common dom chord is 13th, so called because we don&apos;t want<br/>it to clash with the b7.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>I don&apos;t follow you here...</p><p>First case, I meant there is no perfect fifth present since it&apos;s been raised. Second case, called 13th not 6th because it is a dom 7 chord with a 6th up the 8ve so as not to clash with the 7-.<br/>&gt;<br/>However, this altered harmony is different than blues harmony where<br/>I IV and V are all 7th chords and we CAN play the blue notes b3 and<br/>b5 over the maj3 and perfect 5. It can be called b5 now because of<br/>cliche&apos;d blues phrases such as 5 b5 4 b3 3.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>It can&apos;t be called diminished 5th even when used melodically. Rules<br/>valid for altered chromatic scale allows only rising the fourth, not<br/>lowering 5th.</p><p>What, now you&apos;re talking about rules?? What about &quot;I personally don&apos;t like those fixed simplistic assignments&quot;? Who made up our minds for us that &quot;Rules valid for altered chromatic scale&quot; are to override every other &quot;rule&quot;?. It IS a flat fifth because it is preceded by the fifth. Again, this scale approach does not take ordered relations into account, the true meaning of context.<br/>&gt;<br/>But since the scale C Eb F Gb G Bb contains both 4th and 5th, then<br/>the naming is up for grabs.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>Proper spelling is C-Eb-F-F#-G-Bb.</p><p>Not necessarily, F-F#-G on the way up, G-Gb-F on the way down. Besides, the blue note is the flat-fifth, not the sharp fourth.<br/>&gt;<br/>This is often a point of confusion. Besides, blues players<br/>themselves couldn&apos;t care less what its called, which also says<br/>something. So when you say &quot;Normal full 11+ chord has perfect<br/>fifth, and minor 7th, like C-E-G-Bb-D-F#&quot;, you too are confusing the two worlds.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Notwithstanding serialism etc..., for C root we choose F# with B OR Gb with Bb.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>I don&apos;t understand what you mean, if not just more comfortable<br/>reading of the score. But if harmonic rules ask it, we must combine<br/>flats and sharps.</p><p>Yes that&apos;s true. But #11 and b5, though they are enharmonically equal in 12 tet, are different beasts.The reason I state below.<br/>&gt;<br/>Why? Because just as the diminished chord can go up or down min<br/>3rds and remain the same, or the aug by maj 3rds, so too the 7(b5)<br/>can go up or down b7.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>Minor 7th? That must be wrong. You mean tritone probably, then yes<br/>(when we ignore necessary enharmonic changes).</p><p>Yes sorry, tritone transposition.<br/>&gt;<br/>This is because they are the same chord: G7(b5) = G:B:Db:F = Db7(b5) = Db:F:G:B.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Wrong enharmonic spelling: it must be Db-F-Abb-Cb, otherwise it&apos;s not derived from the seventh chord. When you write Db-F-G-B it&apos;s just<br/>second inversion of G-B-Db-F.</p><p>But I am in the key of C here, and Db7(b5) is a very standard substitution leading to a C tonic. I would never write Abb in the key of C, as you wouldn&apos;t either. The horn section would probably beat me up!<br/>&gt;<br/>Adding a D natural or Ab confuses this harmonic function with a<br/>flat 9 which is diminished based (i.e. G7(b9) has Ab dim<br/>harmonicity, but Db7(b9) doesn&apos;t lead to C tonic like Db7(b5)).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>Don&apos;t understand. Such chords like 9-/5- are in use, of course, why<br/>not? It gives Phrygian or Gipsy major scale character.</p><p>I&apos;m saying that we wouldn&apos;t include the perfect fifths from G or Db roots in the 7(b5) chord because the b5 is an alteration to the fifth. We could play G7(b5b9) with an Ab, but there goes the Db substitution.</p><p>Finally, as you know C Eb G Bb D F A is called minor 11,</p><p>min69, 11 and 9/6 chords are totally different.</p><p>No they&apos;re not. We can almost always play an 11 with -69 without any clashes. They belong to the same group. The &quot;vagueness&quot; in certain jazz chord symbols is there for a reason to give leverage. There&apos;s nothing worse when people write charts trying to be &quot;jazzy&quot; with too many fancy chords, because jazz musicians will do this themselves automatically.<br/>&gt;<br/>depending upon extension. Of course this is Dorian. But my original<br/>point was that this chord stands on equal ground as the maj7(#11).<br/>And if we assume that there is a rational JI counterpart, then the<br/>adoption of 19/16 in EVERY SINGLE ONE of these contexts will give<br/>far better approximations to the tempered intervals than 6/5,<br/>32/27. Eg: 3/2 x 19/16 = 57/32 for b7. Then 57/32 x 5/4 = 285/128,<br/>285/256 gives a new whole-tone etc...Or since the fifth is often<br/>the first to go in tonality, 5/4 x 19/16 = 95/64 gives a reasonable<br/>fifth with the correct tonic, as does 81/64 x 19/16 = 1539/1024 =<br/>1.5029...(which is actually closer to 3/2). For bitonal/atonal<br/>symmetries, (19/16)^2 = 1.4101, a better JI sqrt2 than (6/5)^2 =<br/>36/25 = 1.44. The list goes on.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>High math to me. In this purely theoretical disputation I don&apos;t<br/>consider microtones or tempering. Just standard 12 ET.</p><p>But that&apos;s just the point. To truly understand 12 tet, and not just dismiss it as a popular bias, requires seeing objectively all of the JI harmonies, both old and new, that it subsumes. As i&apos;ve said repeatedly, possibilities like 19/16 have completely been ignored historically because it has been stuck in the middle b/w an ongoing argument between JIists and ETists.<br/>&gt;<br/>So you see that I&apos;m not trying to find new harmonies here but<br/>trying to explain the old ones correctly in terms of upper harmonics.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Not everything in classical thirdal harmony can be explained from<br/>upper harmonics, but there&apos;s high probability it was derived from it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m saying that 12 tone harmony has created new approaches to JI<br/>&gt; &gt; and is not necessarily just a bad compromise to trad JI. And I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; &gt; bet that these (my) intervals also sound closer to the whole-tone<br/>&gt; &gt; music of Debussy, the 12 tone of Shoernberg, Berg, and Webern, or<br/>&gt; &gt; the diminished scale and bitonality explored by Scriabin (spelt<br/>&gt; &gt; with a C not K btw) and Messiaen, than low-limit JI.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cheers<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Rick<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Skriabin was Russian composer (besides other languages I&apos;m fluent in<br/>&gt; Russian), so his name can be transliterated from azbuka in more ways<br/>&gt; to the other languages. Skriabin is the nearest one, there&apos;s no<br/>&gt; reason to use &quot;c&quot; for Russian &quot;k&quot;. Azbuka has also special character<br/>&gt; for &quot;ia&quot; (or &quot;ya&quot;), that&apos;s another reason for different<br/>&gt; transliterations. In French they use Scriabine to avoid wrong<br/>&gt; pronunciation. And Japanese write it in katakana as Sukurya-bin<br/>&gt; (where dash means long pronunciation).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW, dear friend, before giving me language lessons, try please learn<br/>&gt; how Sch&ouml;nberg is spelled.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forr&oacute;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=83807 href="#83807">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2009 8:20:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 30 May 2009, at 2:07 PM, rick_ballan wrote:</p><p>&gt; I hope your not talking about me here.

So for eg sqrt 2, 4+ interval, is not really 1.41421356...all the way to infinity but probably a four digit approx such as 181/128 = 1.414062, an odd harmonic over the 7th 8ve. If this is true then 12 ET is a form of JI already. Since Marcel was trying to retune Beethoven in JI as an experiment, because Ludwig also composed in 12 ET I suggested 19/16 as minor third since its much closer to 12 ET than 6/5 and has a correct tonic-denominator, that&apos;s all.</p><p>-Rick</p></div>
