I was sitting next to him, but<br/>didn&apos;t know this until I happened to turn to him, showing a<br/>page from Mandelbaum&apos;s thesis with a diagram of the tuning<br/>for 2 pianos, and said something like &quot;this is how they are<br/>getting 19 tones to the octave with 2 pianos&quot; assuming he<br/>knew little or nothing about tuning. Then I flipped a few pages<br/>and said, &quot;here&apos;s the score to some music on tonight&apos;s concert.&quot;<br/>He took a glance at the page and said, &quot;that&apos;s Joel Mandelbaum&apos;s<br/>doctoral thesis...&quot; (looking up at me and smiling) &quot;I have a copy<br/>of those pieces... on cassette... from way back when...&quot; I said,<br/>&quot;Oh, really? What&apos;s your name?&quot; And he said &quot;George S#%^@*$&quot;<br/>and I said &quot;sorry, what?&quot; and he said &quot;GEORGE SECOR&quot;. I was<br/>surprised, and told him I was glad to meet him. Astonished,<br/>he replied, &quot;you&apos;ve heard of me?&quot; &quot;Oh, yes&quot;, I said. Then he asked<br/>my name, I told him, and he said, &quot;Sorry, I&apos;ve never heard of<br/>you. A friend of mine just told me about this concert&quot;, and the<br/>concert began.</p><p>Later when AKJ said a few things about keyboards, he flashed<br/>an aged and discolored photo of a scalatron. After the concert,<br/>he greeted Joel Mandelbaum warmly as an old acquaintence. I<br/>have no reason to doubt this was the real George Secor, but he<br/>said he had done no work with microtonality since 1981. It was<br/>all quite strange.</p><p>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Apparently some guy turned up at the 19-tone concert in Chicago,<br/>&gt; claiming to be George Secor and also claiming never to have heard of<br/>&gt; the tuning lists before now.
