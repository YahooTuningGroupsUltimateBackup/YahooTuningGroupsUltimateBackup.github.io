Hooker was, of course, one of the last<br/>of the old time maestros, with an incomparable voice, full of deep and<br/>dark meaning, very unique and original. Atkins was  one of the best, and<br/>most influential, guitarists of all time...since he was a huge influence<br/>on Scotty Moore, Elvis&apos;s guitarist, as well as on George Harrison, the<br/>Atkins sound became a significant part of early rock and roll, and<br/>reached millions of budding guitarists, worldwide. He was also one of<br/>the most innovative of the Nashville producers over the years, shaping<br/>the sound of country music, while working with folks such as Jim Reeves,<br/>Don Gibson, Waylon Jennings, Charley Pride, and Jimmy Driftwood. He was<br/>a true legend in his own lifetime, deservedly so...he will be<br/>missed...Hstick</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2001 10:23:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil,</p><p>Buried in a post about something else was a quote I saw from the<br/>memorial for John Lee. I&apos;ll post it here again, just because:</p><p>&quot;Blues harmonica great Charlie Musselwhite said yesterday that when<br/>you listened to John Lee Hooker&apos;s music, you were &apos;listening to his<br/>heart.&apos;&quot;</p><p>Ain&apos;t it the truth.</p><p>Respectfully,<br/>Jon</p></div>
