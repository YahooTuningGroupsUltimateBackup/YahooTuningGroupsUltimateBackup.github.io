(He&apos;s been working on it for 5 years). Nice piece.  Rather<br/>lengthy, a full-length requiem... probably 40 minutes, but interesting<br/>in that the entire chorus of 12 (6 men, 6 women) wore headsets and took<br/>their pitch cues from a laptop computer onstage.  The purpose was to<br/>create a work in just intonation... or some workable system thereof<br/>(adaptive?? whoknows).  Nice sounds of the overtone series behind the<br/>singing added, at times, to the &quot;ethereal&quot; effect.  Some people left,<br/>expecting the traditional Bang on a Can &quot;rock&quot; offerings.  Not that<br/>those type pieces have been bad... it&apos;s just that BOC seems to be<br/>expanding its &quot;palette&quot; these days, going back a bit more to the earlier<br/>times before the big Lincoln Center &quot;commercial&quot; expansion... Twining,<br/>as many list members probably know, posts here from time to time.</p><p>____________ _____ ___ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
