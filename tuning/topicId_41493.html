So I promise not to pursue any protracted argument on the subject.</p><p>I imagine I&apos;m pretty typical of members of this list in having a complex relationship to serialist music. I was steeped in Schoenberg, Webern, Boulez, and Stockhausen - our pantheon - in college. Webern was no less than the prophet of a New Musical Order. But I had also already fallen in love with Ives, Cage, Messiaen, and Partch, and over the years, I found myself wanting to listen to Ives and Partch more and more, while the idea of sitting down to relish Schoenberg&apos;s Variations or Le Marteau seemed more and more ludicrous. In particular, I now believe that I was brainwashed in grad school to listen to 12-tone music in a certain way that made it meaningful, becoming able to follow the rows and pitch areas by ear. And in the process, I was enjoying other music less. During the &apos;80s, in a rather painful but liberating process, I rejected the kind of pitch set thinking that 12-tone music encouraged, and as a result began enjoying other music more, especially jazz, and also started composing much better.</p><p>An example that strikes me as poignant: around 1977 I analyzed Boulez&apos;s Second Sonata before ever hearing it, and the first time I listened to a recording, I was so into the intricacies of the piece that tears rolled down my cheeks. It was an honest emotional reaction, one conditioned not just by the music itself, but by all the analytical time I had spent getting into the structure.</p><p>Today, if you played the Boulez Second Sonata for me in a blindfold test along with three other 12-tone piano pieces, I wouldn&apos;t be able to identify it. Of course that music can be extremely emotionally satisfying if you go to the necessary amount of work to make it that way. But there are tons of music that can give me just as much pleasure or much more without so much work, in which the music itself elicits the emotion without requiring special pleading and analysis. And ultimately, Boulez&apos;s Second is an unmemorable piece unless you&apos;ve just analyzed it.</p><p>I still teach 12-tone music in my classes. Every other year I analyze Webern&apos;s Symphony, Stockhausen&apos;s Gruppen, Babbitt&apos;s Post-Partitions, along with the occasional odd Schoenberg or Dallapiccola piece. My students gravitate enthusiastically toward Messiaen, Bartok, Nancarrow, Feldman, but with Webern and Babbitt they start to resist, and eventually beg me to admit that I don&apos;t find that way of composing rewarding. I present the music with all the objectivity I can muster, but ultimately I think they&apos;re right. I worshipped Webern&apos;s every note (I analyzed all 31 of his opuses in college), but over the years his music has come to sound more and more thin and arbitrary and uninspired. I&apos;ll keep teaching him, and I have a certain affection for his Piano Variations and Second Cantata, but the best I can say for him is, he was an awfully good composer for a musicologist.</p><p>It&apos;s not that 12-tone music isn&apos;t a &quot;valid&quot; way to compose. Eating with six-foot long chopsticks isn&apos;t an &quot;invalid&quot; way to eat, but experience would suggest that it&apos;s a pointless self-limitation, and that more satisfying results are almost certainly likely without them. The fact that I can think of four or five 12-tone pieces, out of hundreds I know, that I still love to listen to - Dallapiccola&apos;s Piccola Musica Notturna, Stockhausen&apos;s Mantra - is almost the exception that proves the rule. And the works that come to mind, including those two named, so far subvert 12-tone technique that they almost prove that the 12-tone language only produced listenable results when you subverted it.</p><p>Add to all this the fact that, for a few decades, serialism was laid out for us as the language of the future to which we would all have to conform; and the fact that while many of us were interested in both serialism and minimalism, the serialist composers fascistically forbade any interest in non-serialist music - I was THERE, and I saw Mario Davidovsky hand any student piece that wasn&apos;t serialist back to the guilty culprit with no comment and a look of withering scorn - and it&apos;s no wonder that serialism leaves a bad taste in the mouths of many of my generation. And chances are that the type of musicians who are interested in alternative tunings are going to be, on average, even less sympathetic to serialism than the general population of musicians, due to the types of musical concerns that drive a person to consider more subtle degrees of consonance and dissonance in the first place.</p><p>Once again: there is no reason in the world that Partch&apos;s *methods* of composing make him a more *valid* composer than Webern. Partch had no *method* in the 12-tone sense; just intonation is not a method of composing. 12-tone music was the basis of a dogmatic ideology, but the composers I know who dismiss it don&apos;t do so on dogmatic or ideological grounds, but as a result of a heavy preponderance of bad experiences. I just feel, after 30 years of experience of 12-tone music, that Partch was a *better* composer than any of the 12-tone people, Schoenberg emphatically included. I think the best composers could intuitively sense that 12-tone technique was a ridiculous self-limitation. In any case, please don&apos;t think that all those of us who &quot;diss&quot; serialism necessarily do so from ignorance, nor from ideology; in some cases, we are all too well-versed in it.</p><p>Back to tuning and/or lurking.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Kyle Gann</p></div><h3><a id=41593 href="#41593">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2002 12:14:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_41493.html#41592">/tuning/topicId_41493.html#41592</a></p><p>I think the best composers<br/>&gt; could intuitively sense that 12-tone technique was a ridiculous<br/>&gt; self-limitation.

In other words, I could write tonal serial music, or atonal JI music, easily enough.</p><p>As a mathematician, serialism is intriguing; it seems to me the full mathematical resources have never been explored. As a music theorist, I note that the techniques of serialism are not based on how we hear, and that it is therefore an artificial system. As such, it is a worthy idea for experimenting, but building a whole school on it seems a dubious enterprise. One could just as easily make up other artificial rules and build schools of music on them.</p></div><h3><a id=41603 href="#41603">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/22/2002 7:14:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Joseph Pehrson &quot; wrote:</p><p>***I wonder if there are any other composers on this list who have</p><p>&gt; either written 12-tone pieces and thrown them out (I have!) or<br/>&gt; written *parts* of pieces in the serial method and then thrown out<br/>&gt; those pages and re-written them in a more *intuitive* fashion (I<br/>&gt; have!)...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J.
