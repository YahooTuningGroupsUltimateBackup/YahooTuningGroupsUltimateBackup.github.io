I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;think so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the other hand, Ken Rubenstein&apos;s and Don Van Vleit&apos;s musics are<br/>&gt; based around 12tet with radical pitch inflections and I am tempted to<br/>&gt; call them microtonal, certainly more so than a meantone Scarlatti...<br/>&gt; Tough question.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John Starrett</p><p>My head has been really heavily into periodicity-block graphing<br/>lately and I kind of avoided answering Jon&apos;s question.  I&apos;d really<br/>have to think more about it, because I&apos;m pretty open-minded<br/>about music.</p><p>But I definitely lean in the same direction as John about Vleit<br/>AKA Captain Beefheart.  I would certainly call his music microtonal<br/>-- intentionally so.  I hear a *lot* of Howlin&apos; Wolf in most<br/>of Vliet&apos;s vocals.</p><p>Another fairly &quot;big&quot; personality skirting on the frige of pop<br/>who&apos;s *very* microtonal these days is Tom Waits.  A former roomate<br/>had a large collection of Waits CDs, and for a couple of years<br/>I heard a lot of his work.  I discern a steadily increasing<br/>influence of Partch on Waits, in the microtonality, the<br/>unusual instrument sounds, and the weird inflections in the<br/>rhythm.</p><p>I know I&apos;ve written about both of these guys before... try<br/>searching the archive.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/1/2002 12:35:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Another fairly &quot;big&quot; personality skirting on the frige of pop</p><p>You mean like a refrigerator magnet? :)</p><p>&gt; who&apos;s *very* microtonal these days is Tom Waits.

Why? Because one of Wait&apos;s<br/>closest friends growing up was Francis Thumm, Chromelodeon player in<br/>the Harry Partch Ensemble, San Diego, 1971-1987.</p><p>Francis had not only introduced Waits to Partch&apos;s music, but Tom came<br/>to a number of our performances, and Francis acted as co-producer (or<br/>some such title) on some of the turning point recordings of Waits,<br/>particularly &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;.</p><p>Not to mention: have you *seen* a Waits concert? Every little thing<br/>about a corporeal experience Partch could have wanted (or anyone<br/>else, for that matter). If he sneaks in &apos;microtones&apos;, fine; frankly,<br/>it is what and how he is communicating that matters to me. String<br/>bending, squawking in a megaphone - if that&apos;s microtonal, fine. I<br/>just like the stuff...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
