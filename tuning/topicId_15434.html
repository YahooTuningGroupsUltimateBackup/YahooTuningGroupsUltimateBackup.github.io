Shouldn&apos;t that be A3-D4-F4?</p><p>Absolutely, and I&apos;m glad that someone caught this: my E3-G3-C4 is a<br/>result of copying the first part of the table to use for the second<br/>part, but not making the needed changes in the note names for the<br/>second part.</p><p>&gt;&gt;     C5  15<br/>&gt;&gt;            8:5<br/>&gt;&gt;     G4  20</p><p>&gt; that should be 8:6 . . .</p><p>Again, thanks for the perspicacious proofreading! Here I suspect that<br/>when typing I was focusing on the minor sixth (indeed 8:5) which C5<br/>forms with E4, but the interval we&apos;re looking at here is certainly an<br/>8:6 fourth.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Might this tie in with Zarlino&apos;s opinion that C4-F4-A4 is &quot;good,&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; but C3-E3-A4 is &quot;better&quot;?</p><p>&gt; This contradicts what you wrote above. Which was did Zarlino see it?</p><p>Fortunately, the contradiction here arises only from my typo or the<br/>like in stating the last quoted sonority, which should be A3-C4-F4<br/>(minor third below fourth), mentioned a bit earlier in this concluding<br/>part of the article.</p><p>Zarlino, in sum, says that C3-F4-A4 is a more harmonious arrangement<br/>of the _major_ third and fourth than F3-A3-D4; but finds a sonority<br/>with the _minor_ third below and fourth above such as A3-C4-F4 yet<br/>better. The converse arrangement with fourth below minor third,<br/>e.g. A3-D4-F4, he finds the least harmonious of all these choices, and<br/>&quot;almost dissonant.&quot;</p><p>Maybe the rather tense qualities of the last combination makes it all<br/>the more effective in a common type of 16th-century cadential<br/>approach, typically leading into a 4-3 suspension:</p><p>F4  E4      D4<br/>D4     C#4  D4<br/>A3          D3</p><p>In this kind of Renaissance/Manneristic setting, the suspended 6:8:9<br/>represents an increase in dissonance from the minor sixth sonority, so<br/>tempered fifths and fourths may reinforce rather than compromise the<br/>cadential grammar, so to speak.</p><p>Apart from the invaluable corrections, you also offer some fascinating<br/>remarks that I&apos;d like to address in a separate reply.</p><p>Anyway, your proofing is a real service, and I&apos;m pleased to say that<br/>I&apos;ve made corrections in my original version for any future use.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
