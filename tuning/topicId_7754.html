Specifically, the ET<br/>is rated by the largest cardinality it can consistently represent.  So if<br/>12tET isn&apos;t consistent at the 19-limit, maybe it would be consistent with<br/>respect to all 19-limit tetrads.  In that case, I would call it &quot;4-part<br/>consistent at the 19-limit&quot;.</p><p>Funny thing is, I&apos;ve searched the first 50 ET&apos;s at all limits up to 19, and<br/>no intermediate results have shown up.  That is, at each limit, the ET is<br/>either consistent with respect to the whole set, or not at all.  IOW, while<br/>12tET is consistent with the [1 7 15 19] tetrad, it is not consistent with<br/>_all_ 19-limit tetrads.  At least, that is what my software is telling me.<br/>There&apos;s a good possibility it&apos;s wrong; I haven&apos;t looked it over carefully<br/>since writing it.  My question is, does this result sound surprising?<br/>Reasonable?  Trivial?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2000 3:44:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote...]<br/>&gt;My question is, does this result sound surprising?

A failure of consistency means there&apos;s at least<br/>one triad that&apos;s failing, and that triad will turn up if you take all the<br/>subsets (down to, of course, triads) of the saturated chord.  That sound<br/>right?  I keep forgetting that consistency doesn&apos;t really involve anything<br/>bigger than a triad!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul Hahn &#x3C;Paul-Hahn@xxxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/13/2000 4:27:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, 13 Jan 2000, Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; Hmm.
