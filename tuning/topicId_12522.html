I had an<br/>opportunity to play Chris Mohr&apos;s microzone a few weeks ago, and I was bowled over. Chris&apos;<br/>particular instrument has 288 keys in 6 rows of 48, and he has it tuned to 53tet.<br/>Unfortunately I do not remember the exact layout of the keys in regards to the tuning, but the<br/>octaves in a particular row were about the spacing of the piano octave, and the pitch rose as<br/>you moved up the 6 rows. It was triggering a Proteus, whose sound I did not care for, for the<br/>most part. The keyboard was velocity sensitive, and I do not remember if it had aftertouch.<br/>Anyhow, it was amazing to have all those little sons of pitches within easy reach, and I had<br/>no trouble at all playing rapid arpeggios or glisses. The buttons are flexible in a way that<br/>sliding across them would trigger notes pretty much uniformly. It is a very natural feeling to<br/>play on a 2d grid (but I have played StarrBoard for many years, so I might be acclimated).<br/>    Would I buy one? If I had $3000 sitting around, I would in a minute. In fact I still<br/>might, even though I would have to save up. Chris thinks that the one he has would cost more<br/>than the $3000 he shelled out since it was an experimental job and Harvey probably didn&apos;t<br/>cover his costs. However, list members might want to consider the ztar as an alternative to<br/>the microzone. It has 6 ranks (&quot;strings&quot;) of  24 keys (&quot;frets&quot;) and may well be suited to your<br/>compositional needs. I may get one from Tod Keene on loan and try it out. I will report and<br/>post some sound files if I do.<br/>    BTW, Chris Mohr is playing the 53tet microzone at Microstock this year. Can&apos;t wait.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3><a id=12542 href="#12542">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2000 8:16:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [John Starrett]<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12522">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12522</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...

I think the Ztar is also a great<br/>instrument, and it&apos;s *much* less expensive than the MicroZone.<br/>(But I still want a MicroZone... someday...)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=12551 href="#12551">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2000 10:18:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Anyhow, it was amazing to have all those little sons of pitches within easy<br/>&gt;reach, and I had no trouble at all playing rapid arpeggios or glisses.</p><p>What about chords?
