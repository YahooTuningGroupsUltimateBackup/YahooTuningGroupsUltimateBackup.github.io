I believe that the instrument for which Mozart (and other<br/>contemporaries) composed had only a single 8&iuml;&iquest;&half; flute register.</p><p>If mechanical organs were tuned as other organs in the era, then some form<br/>of meantone would have been likely, and a 5-limit COFT is very close to<br/>meantone in character. On the other hand, such instruments are often played<br/>out-of-doors where changes in the weather probably meant the instrument was<br/>either constantly ou-of-tune, or constantly being adjusted by the<br/>performer...</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: John A. deLaubenfels &lt;<a href="mailto:jadl@idcomm.com">jadl@idcomm.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Tuesday, June 06, 2000 4:49 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] More sweet Mozart</p><p>I listened to this piece in 5-limit COFT and could hardly believe it<br/>wasn&apos;t adaptively tuned, so sweet did all the chords sound.
