Schenker&apos;s<br/>fundametal melody is _not_ an arpeggio -- it is a _scalar_ descent. I<br/>think D.C.Carr&apos;s description is actually closer to Schenker&apos;s in that<br/>for Schenker, much harmony is simply a way of structuralizing and<br/>embellishing what is ultimately scalar melodic motion, in conjuction<br/>with elaborations of I-V-I bass movements .</p></div>
