It is the religion based on the myth of analysis. Mathematics is one of<br/>its prime tools t so you have a belief that reality can be reflected by numerical reality. Hence<br/>if you break something down into its pieces you can discover what it is, This whole discussion<br/>shows how misplace such religious practices are. First we take a single Dyad (which occurs<br/>isolated rarely in Just intonation ) and compare it with an ET interval that is repeated,<br/>something that is hardly ever repeated ( maybe never except with pythagorean and then it tends to<br/>be known by that name not the former) and attempt to show that the term means nothing or is<br/>imaginary as if numbers are not. Now if we look at the reality of Just intonation we will notice<br/>that it occurs in scales. so possibly we might want to examine scales. The first thing you will<br/>notice is that these scales are almost universally unequal in step sizes. Now those scales<br/>constructed in nature by man divorced from mathematics are also unequal. so it would be possible<br/>to describe any found tuning as JI using the set of infinite integer ratios. we might notice that<br/>those people who use the word equal do not mean what we mean by equal by merely observing what an<br/>&quot;equal&quot; scale means to them. so my conclusion is that ET is nothing but a mathematical hence<br/>religious artifact that has no spontaneous models in reality. What justification in nature do you<br/>have for even proposing ET as a possibility out side of the habitual belief in a mathematical that<br/>can be imposed with<br/>any regard to what is observable.<br/>    My real point (which I hate to say McLaren has reached) is that any use of mathematics is<br/>religious and you better.<br/>    Now there are an infinite amounts infinite series that can be used. Et being one of the most<br/>unimaginative and frankly i see no reason why those of you who are the true believer in applying<br/>mathematics  don&apos;t understand why you don&apos;t apply all mathematical formulas to music.</p><p>&gt;  It is all about words, and the<br/>&gt; difference between the right and wrong ones is critical.</p><p>Who is to decide  this.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
