I realized this myself years ago,<br/>but had forgotten about it.</p><p>For me, rhythm pretty much break down into bundles of 2s and 3s<br/>grouped together in various ways.  I think it&apos;s interesting that<br/>the old mensural notations were based on this concept... but<br/>Margo should step in to finish this thought.  And what about<br/>the unusual polymeters of the Mannerists -- how were *those* rhythms<br/>notated?</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
