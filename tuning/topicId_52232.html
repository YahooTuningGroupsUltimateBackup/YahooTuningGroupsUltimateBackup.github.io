Its main advocate is<br/>Charles Lucy, who discovered it in the eighteenth century writings of<br/>John &apos;Longitude&apos; Harrison. The Lucy tuned perfect fifth is 0.0384 cents<br/>sharper than the fifth of 88 tone equal temperament, and a mere 0.01015<br/>cents flatter than 3/10-comma meantone, and therefore is audibly<br/>indistinguishable from either.</p><p>Dessent follows:</p><p>Many musicians believe that extreme precision is significant in musical<br/>tuning, as different beat frequencies are heard, which are<br/>characteristic of each different tuning.</p><p>&quot;I appreciate that I could appear to be beating angels on pinheads to<br/>death. Yet......... There is a valid reason for my demands about<br/>precision.</p><p>I am thinking beyond only the cent values, and preparing for the day<br/>when the precision of our tuning technology improves,</p><p>The production, analysis and discussion of beat frequencies will then<br/>become both practical and significant.&quot; (quote from Charles Lucy Jan.<br/>2004.)</p><p>End of dissent.</p><p>A major tone is two fifths up and an octave down, so in Lucy tuning it<br/>will be 2(600+300/&pi;)-1200 = 600/&pi; cents. The major third therefore is<br/>two tones, or 1200/&pi; cents, which is an octave divided logarithmically<br/>by &pi; or the &pi;-th root of two. This works out as 381.972 cents, 4.342<br/>cents flatter than a just major third. A diatonic semitone is the<br/>interval between a major third and a fourth, which in Lucy tuning will<br/>be (600-300/&pi;)-1200/&pi; = 600-1500/&pi; cents, or 122.535 cents. Any<br/>interval can equally well be expressed in terms of octaves and fifths<br/>or whole tones and diatonic semitones. If we call the whole tone L and<br/>the diatonic semitone s, the familiar diatonic scale is LLsLLLs, and a<br/>Lucy-tuned diatonic scale will be one with the above specific values<br/>for L and s.</p><p>In Robert Smith&apos;s Harmonics of 1749 we find the following description<br/>of Harrison&apos;s system of tuning:</p><p>He told me he took a thin ruler equal in length to the smallest string<br/>of his base viol. and divided it as a monochord, by taking the interval<br/>of the major IIId, to that of the VIIIth, as the diameter of a circle,<br/>to its circumference. Then by the divisions on the ruler applied to<br/>that string, he adjusted the frets upon the neck of the viol. and found<br/>the harmony of the consonances so extremely fine that after a very<br/>small and gradual lengthening of the other strings at the nut, by<br/>reason of their greater stiffness he acquiesced in that manner the<br/>placing of the frets.</p><p>While Smith himself interpreted this somehow to mean that Harrison&apos;s<br/>major thirds were a comma flat, it does seem to say that the proportion<br/>of third to octave is 1:&pi;, which only seems to make sense if it is<br/>interpreted so that this proportion is logarithmic, or in other words,<br/>that Harrison&apos;s third is the 1200/&pi; third of Lucy tuning.<br/>&lt;end&gt;</p><p>As it now seem to be &quot;open season&quot;, perhaps others would like to make<br/>their own edits ;-)<br/>If so go to</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_tuning">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_tuning</a></p><p>Have Fun!</p><p>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a> (LucyScaleDevelopments)<br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to: <a href="http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/">http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.co.uk">http://www.lucytune.co.uk</a>  or <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div>
