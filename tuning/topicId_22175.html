I just<br/>finished a little ditty which happens to be microtonal (it uses a wierd<br/>system Ben Johnston Jokingly calls Unjust Intonation - it seems like a<br/>fitting name). Anyone who works in Csound I would suggest taking a look at<br/>some of the newer sound synth languages like Supercollider (what I use) or<br/>Max. They work for live performances and if I remember correctly, its been a<br/>while, Csound does not work in real time (although direct Csound might I dont<br/>remember). As for your question it can take a good chunk of time to program<br/>that stuff depending on how complicated you make it and what program you are<br/>using. I haven&apos;t used Csound very much myself but from what I read it uses<br/>mostly lists of notes to represent whatever you are doing(correct me if this<br/>is incorrect).</p><p>        With other programs, like Supercollider, things go much quicker<br/>simply because there are programming techniques which simplify things. With<br/>Supercollider though you could tell the computer to just do random things or<br/>generate random pitches or lots of other really simple things, which wouldn&apos;t<br/>take long, or you can make an intricate super ellaborate program which takes<br/>in live audio modifies it, pitch shifts things, has patterns, or whatever<br/>which would of course take more time.</p><p>cheers,</p><p>Andy Stefik</p></div><h3><a id=22222 href="#22222">ðŸ”—</a>prentrodgers@home.com</h3><span>5/6/2001 8:51:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>This song took me six months. Lots of time on coding the pre-<br/>preprocessor program in Pascal, called &quot;samples&quot;, to accept different<br/>timing options (which randomize the start time of notes to imitate<br/>the out of phase playing of high school drum and bugle corps). I also<br/>spent some time implementing the upsampling and downsampling options.<br/>These allow me to make miniature pianos and giant piccolos. I hand<br/>coded all the glissando&apos;s: 65 different slides, up and down by<br/>different amounts to allow the move from 4:5:6 to 7:9:11 in all<br/>inversions and combinations. The program picks which one to use<br/>randomly. Each time through is different.</p><p>This is not the fastest way to make music. But I can&apos;t figure out a<br/>faster alternative. How else do you get to hear these chord changes,<br/>in perfect intonation, perfect rhythms, and never hear anyone<br/>complain about one more time through?</p><p>I think I may be able to move a little faster when soccer season<br/>ends.</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., John Starrett &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Another fine piece of microtonal music Prent.

I didn&apos;t realize the immense amount of coding thats<br/>required for CSound(let alone using turbo pascal along with it), I&apos;ve only<br/>used it very briefly. With SC programmings quite different. Its easy to<br/>create a little function that puts whatever ratios, or temperaments desired<br/>into patterns. you could for example set a ton of material into a variable<br/>and then later manipulate that pattern, meaning pattern of ratios to a<br/>fundamental or frequencies in general, and modulate it or whatever you want<br/>by whatever ratio or number you want with very little code. Of course this<br/>all depends on how specific you want to be with everything</p><p>Or you can work in scale degrees or other ways I havent messed with much. It<br/>does have a feature that can do lists of notes which I&apos;ve used briefly but I<br/>always tend to make a mistake here or there (wrong duration for a note or<br/>what not which screws everything up). Everything you specify, unless you are<br/>specifically using lists of notes, can of course be specified of course but<br/>you definately dont have to specify it for every note.</p><p>I wish it was supported on PC. I am more of a PC guy myself.</p><p>Thanks for the info on how you work with the microtones, interesting.</p><p>Andy</p></div>
