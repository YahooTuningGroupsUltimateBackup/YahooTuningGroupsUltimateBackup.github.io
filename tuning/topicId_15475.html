Also, the great work of Patrick Grant,<br/>who did the sound.  This was a VERY complex all-day event.  I<br/>wouldn&apos;t dream, myself, of trying to produce anything of this<br/>complexity.  Despite minor snaffus, it adhered pretty much to<br/>schedule, with the usual New York City problems of time and space...<br/>not enough rehearsal space and not enough time to schedule rehearsal.</p><p>These are endemic New York City problems, not particular to the AFMM.</p><p>In short the problem in New York doesn&apos;t take Einstein to figure<br/>out...  time=space, time=money, and money,money is what&apos;s always<br/>lacking.... at least for alternative arts events...</p><p>__________ ____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson<br/>board officer, AFMM</p></div>
