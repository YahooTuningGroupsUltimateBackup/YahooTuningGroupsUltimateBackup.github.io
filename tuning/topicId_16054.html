In an n-tone MOS, the<br/>interval formed from n generators is the interval of coloration.<br/>    When this idea is expanded to two dimensions, there are three intervals<br/>of coloration, one of which is the sum of the other two.

At least as general as the normal<br/>way of making a MOS in terms of the family of<br/>scales you can make with it.</p><p> I vaguely remember that there was some connection<br/>with n-ets maybe, using those numbers to select<br/> particular subsets of a larger n-et, or maybe that was<br/>some other closely related topic, we are talking about<br/>a discussion that took place over five years ago now<br/>and my memory of it isn&apos;t that clear. At any rate<br/>there is a particular construction that<br/>he is describing there which generates those<br/>scales in a recursive way.</p><p>It took a lot of explaining and I came very close to understanding<br/>it when we had to break off.</p><p>In that post, he uses a number<br/>of shorthands like silver weighting etc and his a b c notation,<br/>all of which have to be explained before one can know what they mean<br/>- they do refer to particular very specific constructions<br/>that need to be described and understood, and there<br/>are many assumed details that one can&apos;t<br/>know from reading the post, just<br/>like a mathematical paper relying on<br/>results and definitions in earlier papers.</p><p>Also do you have any ideas about his conjecture that<br/>the only completely rational trivalent scales are the<br/>ones with an odd number of notes? He may even<br/>have proved it or got very close<br/>to doing so, I remember discussing that with<br/>him too, and it is rather intriguing.</p><p>In our discussions, we found that it<br/>takes time on both sides, for the<br/>mathematician listener  to figure out<br/>what he is saying, also for him to work out<br/>how to say it and to answer all the questions.<br/>I think what it is is that he has figured out some of<br/>the mathematical techniques he needed<br/>largely for himself, so has got used to rather<br/>individual ways of presenting it, but whenever I have had the<br/>opportunity to follow it through, the reasoning<br/>has  been sound, the results interesting, and<br/>often coming at the ideas with a novel slant.<br/>There is a lot more to what he says than<br/>often appears at first sight when one reads it.<br/>It is well worth the effort on both sides if<br/>one has the time to do it.</p><p> If no-one else can describe his technique to me, I<br/>hope to come back to the discussion<br/>when I have more time.</p><p>BTW I did a comprehensive search of the<br/>SCALA archive for trivalent scales and higher<br/>valency scales ,and you will still find it somewhere in the<br/>files area under my name probably.<br/>I can&apos;t remember how I did it, except that it<br/>involved some programming and I have a vague<br/>idea I may have somehow used FTS to prepare<br/>the list of scales, but can&apos;t remember how.</p><p>Just did a search of my desktop for &quot;trivalent&quot; and found a note<br/>about it where I mention that the search turned up<br/>only one trivalent scale with an even number of notes<br/>which was:</p><p>arabic1.scl | From Fortuna.

What do you think?</p><p>    Sounds good, except I don&apos;t like the part about the fundamental&apos;s<br/>    absolute pitch. First off, what happens if it isn&apos;t a power<br/>    of 3? Secondly, I don&apos;t think performers (or composers) need<br/>    to know this. There&apos;s no way a bass is going to be able to say,<br/>    &quot;Oh, 3129/8080, I was a bit flat there, wasn&apos;t I?&quot;</p><p>    Performers are more likely to be interested in which note<br/>    remain unchanged or nearly unchanged between chords. They<br/>    can then tune pure to it/them. For nearly unchanged notes,<br/>    yes I agree plenty of mileage could be gotten out of only one<br/>    type of &quot;nearly&quot;. I like drawing lines to make the common<br/>    tones obvious. Then one doesn&apos;t even have to read music (or<br/>    both clefs) to know that he&apos;s got to match the bari&apos;s previous<br/>    pitch. Dotted lines make a good nearly, with perhaps a plus<br/>    or minus sign above them to indicate direction.</p><p>    That takes care of shifts. Drift I think is best shown as a<br/>    cumulative cents offset from concert pitch. Every time the<br/>    offset changes direction -- say it&apos;s been going flat and<br/>    starts going sharp -- the current offset should be printed<br/>    above the barline. Say we start out at A=440, go 20 cents<br/>    flat every other bar for 5 bars, then go 20 cents sharp every<br/>    other bar for 5 bars and end on A=440. The notation would<br/>    show &quot;-100&quot; above the 6th barline and &quot;+-0&quot; above the last<br/>    barline. The point is that this is something that should<br/>    happen naturally if one tunes pure and respects the shifts<br/>    notation (above). It&apos;s just there as a check so you can<br/>    troubleshoot whether you&apos;re going flat &apos;cause you&apos;re tired<br/>    or because the composer/arranger intended it.</p><p>    -Carl</p><p>    Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>    Messages in this topic (10)<br/>    1c.

I observed that 34 is the only tuning that has both a<br/>    good 5/4 and 5/3 and also has the Archytas comma tempered out in the<br/>    upward jump of the fifth between 7/4 and 4/3 (at 0:27-0:28). But I<br/>    can&apos;t say that it&apos;s clearly my favorite for that reason, because I<br/>    also liked 46 and 68 better than the others.</p><p>    In the paper, I didn&apos;t mean to give the impression that wide fifths<br/>    are necessarily better melodically under all circumstances -- I was<br/>    writing specifically about a diatonic scale, where wide fifths result<br/>    in significantly narrower-than-12ET diatonic semitones. Several<br/>    times in the paper (pp. 59, 74, 75), I made statements to the effect<br/>    that chromatic semitones in 31-ET could be used to enhance the<br/>    melodic effect of that (narrow-fifth) tuning, so the size of the<br/>    fifths is, under more general circumstances, beside the point.</p><p>    If your tuning has dozens of tones/octave, you then have<br/>    opportunities to alter the mood on the fly by making subtle<br/>    substitutions in your scale subset, so it&apos;s not wise to draw<br/>    conclusions too quickly about one of these tunings vs. another.</p><p>    --George</p><p>    Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>    Messages in this topic (9)<br/>    3.

At least as general as the normal<br/>way of making a MOS in terms of the family of<br/>scales you can make with it.</p><p> I vaguely remember that there was some connection<br/>with n-ets maybe, using those numbers to select<br/> particular subsets of a larger n-et, or maybe that was<br/>some other closely related topic, we are talking about<br/>a discussion that took place over five years ago now<br/>and my memory of it isn&apos;t that clear. At any rate<br/>there is a particular construction that<br/>he is describing there which generates those<br/>scales in a recursive way.</p><p>It took a lot of explaining and I came very close to understanding<br/>it when we had to break off.</p><p>In that post, he uses a number<br/>of shorthands like silver weighting etc and his a b c notation,<br/>all of which have to be explained before one can know what they mean<br/>- they do refer to particular very specific constructions<br/>that need to be described and understood, and there<br/>are many assumed details that one can&apos;t<br/>know from reading the post, just<br/>like a mathematical paper relying on<br/>results and definitions in earlier papers.</p><p>Also do you have any ideas about his conjecture that<br/>the only completely rational trivalent scales are the<br/>ones with an odd number of notes? He may even<br/>have proved it or got very close<br/>to doing so, I remember discussing that with<br/>him too, and it is rather intriguing.</p><p>In our discussions, we found that it<br/>takes time on both sides, for the<br/>mathematician listener  to figure out<br/>what he is saying, also for him to work out<br/>how to say it and to answer all the questions.<br/>I think what it is is that he has figured out some of<br/>the mathematical techniques he needed<br/>largely for himself, so has got used to rather<br/>individual ways of presenting it, but whenever I have had the<br/>opportunity to follow it through, the reasoning<br/>has  been sound, the results interesting, and<br/>often coming at the ideas with a novel slant.<br/>It is well worth the effort on both sides if<br/>one has the time to do it.</p><p> If no-one else can describe his technique to me, I<br/>hope to come back to the discussion<br/>when I have more time.</p><p>BTW I did a comprehensive search of the<br/>SCALA archive for trivalent scales and higher<br/>valency scales ,and you will still find it somewhere in the<br/>files area under my name probably.<br/>I can&apos;t remember how I did it, except that it<br/>involved some programming and I have a vague<br/>idea I may have somehow used FTS to prepare<br/>the list of scales, but can&apos;t remember how.</p><p>Just did a search of my desktop for &quot;trivalent&quot; and found a note<br/>about it where I mention that the search turned up<br/>only one trivalent scale with an even number of notes<br/>which was:</p><p>arabic1.scl | From Fortuna. Try C or G major<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 100 cents 200 cents 300 cents 350 cents 500 cents 600 cents 700<br/>cents 800 cents 900<br/>&gt; cents 1000 cents 1050 cents 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or in 24-tet:<br/>&gt; 0 2 4 6 7 10 12 14 16 18 20 21 24<br/>&gt; steps:<br/>&gt; 2 2 2 1 3 2 2 2 2 2 1 3</p><p>It also turned up a number of modes of et scales<br/>as trivalent, and they were all with even<br/>number of notes, so I wonder if it goes both<br/>ways, that all et trivalent scales have an<br/>even number of notes and that all rational<br/>trivalent scales have an odd number,<br/>at least the data seems to suggest<br/>that as a conjecture.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: Wednesday, October 25, 2006 11:50 AM<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Digest Number 4177</p><p>  Welcome to the Alternate Tunings Mailing List.<br/>  Messages In This Digest (6 Messages)<br/>    1a.

What do you think?</p><p>    Sounds good, except I don&apos;t like the part about the fundamental&apos;s<br/>    absolute pitch. First off, what happens if it isn&apos;t a power<br/>    of 3? Secondly, I don&apos;t think performers (or composers) need<br/>    to know this. There&apos;s no way a bass is going to be able to say,<br/>    &quot;Oh, 3129/8080, I was a bit flat there, wasn&apos;t I?&quot;</p><p>    Performers are more likely to be interested in which note<br/>    remain unchanged or nearly unchanged between chords. They<br/>    can then tune pure to it/them. For nearly unchanged notes,<br/>    yes I agree plenty of mileage could be gotten out of only one<br/>    type of &quot;nearly&quot;. I like drawing lines to make the common<br/>    tones obvious. Then one doesn&apos;t even have to read music (or<br/>    both clefs) to know that he&apos;s got to match the bari&apos;s previous<br/>    pitch. Dotted lines make a good nearly, with perhaps a plus<br/>    or minus sign above them to indicate direction.</p><p>    That takes care of shifts. Drift I think is best shown as a<br/>    cumulative cents offset from concert pitch. Every time the<br/>    offset changes direction -- say it&apos;s been going flat and<br/>    starts going sharp -- the current offset should be printed<br/>    above the barline. Say we start out at A=440, go 20 cents<br/>    flat every other bar for 5 bars, then go 20 cents sharp every<br/>    other bar for 5 bars and end on A=440. The notation would<br/>    show &quot;-100&quot; above the 6th barline and &quot;+-0&quot; above the last<br/>    barline. The point is that this is something that should<br/>    happen naturally if one tunes pure and respects the shifts<br/>    notation (above). It&apos;s just there as a check so you can<br/>    troubleshoot whether you&apos;re going flat &apos;cause you&apos;re tired<br/>    or because the composer/arranger intended it.</p><p>    -Carl</p><p>    Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>    Messages in this topic (10)<br/>    1c.

I observed that 34 is the only tuning that has both a<br/>    good 5/4 and 5/3 and also has the Archytas comma tempered out in the<br/>    upward jump of the fifth between 7/4 and 4/3 (at 0:27-0:28). But I<br/>    can&apos;t say that it&apos;s clearly my favorite for that reason, because I<br/>    also liked 46 and 68 better than the others.</p><p>    In the paper, I didn&apos;t mean to give the impression that wide fifths<br/>    are necessarily better melodically under all circumstances -- I was<br/>    writing specifically about a diatonic scale, where wide fifths result<br/>    in significantly narrower-than-12ET diatonic semitones. Several<br/>    times in the paper (pp. 59, 74, 75), I made statements to the effect<br/>    that chromatic semitones in 31-ET could be used to enhance the<br/>    melodic effect of that (narrow-fifth) tuning, so the size of the<br/>    fifths is, under more general circumstances, beside the point.</p><p>    If your tuning has dozens of tones/octave, you then have<br/>    opportunities to alter the mood on the fly by making subtle<br/>    substitutions in your scale subset, so it&apos;s not wise to draw<br/>    conclusions too quickly about one of these tunings vs. another.</p><p>    --George</p><p>    Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>    Messages in this topic (9)<br/>    3.

He may even<br/>have proved it or got very close<br/>to doing so, I remember discussing that with<br/>him too, and it is rather intriguing.</p><p>In our discussions, we found that it<br/>takes time on both sides, for the<br/>mathematician listener  to figure out<br/>what he is saying, also for him to work out<br/>how to say it and to answer all the questions.<br/>I think what it is is that he has figured out some of<br/>the mathematical techniques he needed<br/>largely for himself, so has got used to rather<br/>individual ways of presenting it, but whenever I have had the<br/>opportunity to follow it through, the reasoning<br/>has  been sound, the results interesting, and<br/>often coming at the ideas with a novel slant.<br/>There is a lot more to what he says than<br/>often appears at first sight when one reads it.<br/>It is well worth the effort on both sides if<br/>one has the time to do it.</p><p> If no-one else can describe his technique to me, I<br/>hope to come back to the discussion<br/>when I have more time.</p><p>BTW I did a comprehensive search of the<br/>SCALA archive for trivalent scales and higher<br/>valency scales ,and you will still find it somewhere in the<br/>files area under my name probably.<br/>I can&apos;t remember how I did it, except that it<br/>involved some programming and I have a vague<br/>idea I may have somehow used FTS to prepare<br/>the list of scales, but can&apos;t remember how.</p><p>Just did a search of my desktop for &quot;trivalent&quot; and found a note<br/>about it where I mention that the search turned up<br/>only one trivalent scale with an even number of notes<br/>which was:</p><p>arabic1.scl | From Fortuna. Try C or G major<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1 100 cents 200 cents 300 cents 350 cents 500 cents 600 cents 700<br/>cents 800 cents 900<br/>&gt; cents 1000 cents 1050 cents 2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or in 24-tet:<br/>&gt; 0 2 4 6 7 10 12 14 16 18 20 21 24<br/>&gt; steps:<br/>&gt; 2 2 2 1 3 2 2 2 2 2 1 3</p><p>It also turned up a number of modes of et scales<br/>as trivalent, and they were all with even<br/>number of notes, so I wonder if it goes both<br/>ways, that all et trivalent scales have an<br/>even number of notes and that all rational<br/>trivalent scales have an odd number,<br/>at least the data seems to suggest<br/>that as a conjecture.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: Wednesday, October 25, 2006 11:50 AM<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Digest Number 4177</p><p>  Welcome to the Alternate Tunings Mailing List.<br/>  Messages In This Digest (6 Messages)<br/>    1a.

What do you think?</p><p>    Sounds good, except I don&apos;t like the part about the fundamental&apos;s<br/>    absolute pitch. First off, what happens if it isn&apos;t a power<br/>    of 3? Secondly, I don&apos;t think performers (or composers) need<br/>    to know this. There&apos;s no way a bass is going to be able to say,<br/>    &quot;Oh, 3129/8080, I was a bit flat there, wasn&apos;t I?&quot;</p><p>    Performers are more likely to be interested in which note<br/>    remain unchanged or nearly unchanged between chords. They<br/>    can then tune pure to it/them. For nearly unchanged notes,<br/>    yes I agree plenty of mileage could be gotten out of only one<br/>    type of &quot;nearly&quot;. I like drawing lines to make the common<br/>    tones obvious. Then one doesn&apos;t even have to read music (or<br/>    both clefs) to know that he&apos;s got to match the bari&apos;s previous<br/>    pitch. Dotted lines make a good nearly, with perhaps a plus<br/>    or minus sign above them to indicate direction.</p><p>    That takes care of shifts. Drift I think is best shown as a<br/>    cumulative cents offset from concert pitch. Every time the<br/>    offset changes direction -- say it&apos;s been going flat and<br/>    starts going sharp -- the current offset should be printed<br/>    above the barline. Say we start out at A=440, go 20 cents<br/>    flat every other bar for 5 bars, then go 20 cents sharp every<br/>    other bar for 5 bars and end on A=440. The notation would<br/>    show &quot;-100&quot; above the 6th barline and &quot;+-0&quot; above the last<br/>    barline. The point is that this is something that should<br/>    happen naturally if one tunes pure and respects the shifts<br/>    notation (above). It&apos;s just there as a check so you can<br/>    troubleshoot whether you&apos;re going flat &apos;cause you&apos;re tired<br/>    or because the composer/arranger intended it.</p><p>    -Carl</p><p>    Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>    Messages in this topic (10)<br/>    1c.

I&apos;m fond of the extra shimmer 99 adds<br/>    on,<br/>    &gt; though it generally sounds a lot like the JI version.

I observed that 34 is the only tuning that has both a<br/>    good 5/4 and 5/3 and also has the Archytas comma tempered out in the<br/>    upward jump of the fifth between 7/4 and 4/3 (at 0:27-0:28). But I<br/>    can&apos;t say that it&apos;s clearly my favorite for that reason, because I<br/>    also liked 46 and 68 better than the others.</p><p>    In the paper, I didn&apos;t mean to give the impression that wide fifths<br/>    are necessarily better melodically under all circumstances -- I was<br/>    writing specifically about a diatonic scale, where wide fifths result<br/>    in significantly narrower-than-12ET diatonic semitones. Several<br/>    times in the paper (pp. 59, 74, 75), I made statements to the effect<br/>    that chromatic semitones in 31-ET could be used to enhance the<br/>    melodic effect of that (narrow-fifth) tuning, so the size of the<br/>    fifths is, under more general circumstances, beside the point.</p><p>    If your tuning has dozens of tones/octave, you then have<br/>    opportunities to alter the mood on the fly by making subtle<br/>    substitutions in your scale subset, so it&apos;s not wise to draw<br/>    conclusions too quickly about one of these tunings vs. another.</p><p>    --George</p><p>    Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>    Messages in this topic (9)<br/>    3.

Which is an interesting result because as I understood it, unlike what I was doing which was hit or miss, every scale in his family was trivalent.</p><p>Dan would need to come in on this - I was under the impression that his scales were irrational ones but may be wrong. However, once one has a family of trivalent scales like that, one can try converting them into  rational scales with the same patterns of L, M and S steps and roughly the same step sizes, like the conversion  of the diatonic into a trivalent et scale done in reverse.</p><p>So for example the diatonic:</p><p>1/1 9/8 5/4 45/32 3/2 27/16 15/8 2/1<br/>=  9/8 10/9 9/8 16/15 9/8 10/9 16/15</p><p>L M - L S - L M - S</p><p>L M L S L M S<br/>M L S L M S L<br/>L S L M S L M<br/>S L M S L M L<br/>L M S L M L S<br/>M S L M L S L<br/>S L M L S L M</p><p>one step intervals are L, M, S<br/>two step intervals are<br/>LM, ML, LS, and re-orderings</p><p>three step intervals are<br/>LML, MLS, LSL, and re-orderings</p><p>so any scale with this sequence of L, M and S steps is trivalent<br/>so long  as the three step sizes are unequal, and none of those<br/>six two or three step sizes are equal to each other.<br/>.<br/>So having come up with  an L M S step pattern that  works, ET, or otherwise, one  can then create many rational scales from it.</p><p>Maybe one could begin to see why even numbered trivalent scales are impossible in some way by looking at the patterns of step sizes in even trivalent  scales and to see what it is about how they work that means that they can&apos;t convert into rationals. Those are just a couple of ideas I&apos;m throwing out which I might follow up if I have  time later.</p><p>Here:<br/><a href="http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/cK5BRZEHgUbcTrVSXNq_Gf312XP2b5Wsli335JCOjaZBCpvKNE4wstbrq48cU59yKjBwupgMVSp0zkwT4xNJqvV7qjilOu-DOTHW/Robert%20Walker/n-valent_et_modes.txt">http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/cK5BRZEHgUbcTrVSXNq_Gf312XP2b5Wsli335JCOjaZBCpvKNE4wstbrq48cU59yKjBwupgMVSp0zkwT4xNJqvV7qjilOu-DOTHW/Robert%20Walker/n-valent_et_modes.txt</a><br/>(notation explained here:<br/><a href="http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/cK5BReOWKVbcTrVSfGxGbRvxMcNMPsBuHxqdMDyvfuRmP4t-5UlqZ_lZ04VshnXEPIW1GYgKHR5gU1TS5bpQrJ8XS-74NO6l4Ml8/Robert%20Walker/n-valent_modes_info.txt">http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/cK5BReOWKVbcTrVSfGxGbRvxMcNMPsBuHxqdMDyvfuRmP4t-5UlqZ_lZ04VshnXEPIW1GYgKHR5gU1TS5bpQrJ8XS-74NO6l4Ml8/Robert%20Walker/n-valent_modes_info.txt</a><br/>)<br/>the first trivalent scale is:<br/>2 1 4 1 4  V___3_n__5_alt_class_1_z_2_a_1_[_2]_b_4_[_2]_abab_class_2_z_6_a_5_[_3]_b_3_aaba_class_3_z_9_a_7_[_3]_b_6_aaba_alt_class_4_z10_a_8_[_2]_b11_[_2]_abab_   29 Hira-joshi: Japan</p><p>BTW it has 5 steps so I&apos;m just mis-remembering when I thought that the et scales had only even numbers of step sizes.

Hyper-MOS question<br/>    Posted by: &quot;Robert walker&quot; <a href="mailto:robertwalker@robertinventor.com">robertwalker@robertinventor.com</a>   robert_inventor5<br/>    Wed Oct 25, 2006 8:20 am (PST)<br/>    Welcome to the Alternate Tunings Mailing List.Hi Chris,</p><p>    Dan Stearns and I had a long discussion a while back about the generation of hyper-mos scales which should be trivalent, three interval sizes for each possible number of scale degrees, by analogy with a MOS which has two interval sizes for each possible number of scale degrees. It was partly motivated by the observation that many scales in the SCALA archive are trivalent, and many are also quadrivalent, or more.</p><p>    I had the idea of a generator involving two intervals such as 5/4 6/5 alternating,<br/>    1/1 5/4 3/2,<br/>    which you then repeat as:<br/>    1/1 5/4 3/2 15//8 9/8 45/32 27/16<br/>    which is where the scale you found on the tunesmithy site comes from.<br/>    That is trivalent, as you can check in Scala.</p><p>    If you continue a bit further you get another trivalent &quot;moment of symmetry&quot; at seventeen notes.</p><p>    So the method produces a few trivalent scales, but is only moderately successful.</p><p>    You can read more about my alternating generators method here:<br/>    <a href="http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/More_scales.htm#mos">http://www.tunesmithy.netfirms.com/fts_help/More_scales.htm#mos</a></p><p>    Dan followed another line of investigation which was far more successful and he could produce many trivalent scales to order. However I got busy with programming and he took a long break not long after so the discussion got rather broken off, and I can&apos;t say I understand his method quite yet. Also since then I have been so pre-occupied with programming FTS and particularly the upcoming FTS 3.0 release that I have done little by way of further scales explorations.</p><p>    I added that programming to FTS as part of the process of investigation. I see that II didn&apos;t explain the situation properly in the help. I just explained how the option in FTS works. To give the context properly, I should have explainedhat what I was describing is just one of two current candidates for a notion of Hyper MOS, and give the reader some pointer to Dan&apos;s more successful method</p><p>    Anyway, he is the one to ask, as I think his version is probably a better candidate for the label &quot;Hyper MOS&quot; as it is more successful at generating trivalent scales.</p><p>    This is Dan Stearn&apos;s Eureka post about his Hyper MOS method:</p><p>    <a href="/tuning/topicId_16061.html#16585">/tuning/topicId_16061.html#16585</a><br/>    <a href="/tuning/topicId_19322.html#19361">/tuning/topicId_19322.html#19361</a></p><p>    Then it got taken up again on the tuning-math list in a discussion of &quot;Tribonacci scales&quot;. But I hadn&apos;t got the time to follow the discussion there either.</p><p>    I hope I get a chance to get back to this some time. It would be great to program Dan&apos;s method as well as mine.</p><p>    He also had an interesting conjecture that every trivalent scale with an even number of notes has to contain an irrational interval, and later I think he concluded that it has to be a subset of an n-et as well, so if that is so, the rational hyper-mos&apos;s have to have an odd number of notes.</p><p>    Unfortunately I haven&apos;t go tthe time to join in discussing it at present either. But if anyone feels they could summarize the conclusions and describe it to me - the construction algorithm for his scales - sufficiently so that I can program it, then I&apos;m interested to program it in FTS, and should do to complement my own less successful method. Or later once I have the time to read it all up and get up to date with it. Also I wonder if it might be in Scala by now?</p><p>    Meanwhile anyway I&apos;ll add a note to the help and to the window in FTS to make it clear that Dan Stearns method exists and is probably a better candidate for the term &quot;hyper MOS&quot;</p><p>    Robert</p><p>    ----- Original Message -----<br/>    From: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>    To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>    Sent: Wednesday, October 25, 2006 11:50 AM<br/>    Subject: [tuning] Digest Number 4177</p><p>    Welcome to the Alternate Tunings Mailing List.<br/>    Messages In This Digest (6 Messages)<br/>    1a.

What do you think?</p><p>    Sounds good, except I don&apos;t like the part about the fundamental&apos;s<br/>    absolute pitch. First off, what happens if it isn&apos;t a power<br/>    of 3? Secondly, I don&apos;t think performers (or composers) need<br/>    to know this. There&apos;s no way a bass is going to be able to say,<br/>    &quot;Oh, 3129/8080, I was a bit flat there, wasn&apos;t I?&quot;</p><p>    Performers are more likely to be interested in which note<br/>    remain unchanged or nearly unchanged between chords. They<br/>    can then tune pure to it/them. For nearly unchanged notes,<br/>    yes I agree plenty of mileage could be gotten out of only one<br/>    type of &quot;nearly&quot;. I like drawing lines to make the common<br/>    tones obvious. Then one doesn&apos;t even have to read music (or<br/>    both clefs) to know that he&apos;s got to match the bari&apos;s previous<br/>    pitch. Dotted lines make a good nearly, with perhaps a plus<br/>    or minus sign above them to indicate direction.</p><p>    That takes care of shifts. Drift I think is best shown as a<br/>    cumulative cents offset from concert pitch. Every time the<br/>    offset changes direction -- say it&apos;s been going flat and<br/>    starts going sharp -- the current offset should be printed<br/>    above the barline. Say we start out at A=440, go 20 cents<br/>    flat every other bar for 5 bars, then go 20 cents sharp every<br/>    other bar for 5 bars and end on A=440. The notation would<br/>    show &quot;-100&quot; above the 6th barline and &quot;+-0&quot; above the last<br/>    barline. The point is that this is something that should<br/>    happen naturally if one tunes pure and respects the shifts<br/>    notation (above).

I&apos;m fond of the extra shimmer 99 adds<br/>    on,<br/>    &gt; though it generally sounds a lot like the JI version.

I observed that 34 is the only tuning that has both a<br/>    good 5/4 and 5/3 and also has the Archytas comma tempered out in the<br/>    upward jump of the fifth between 7/4 and 4/3 (at 0:27-0:28). But I<br/>    can&apos;t say that it&apos;s clearly my favorite for that reason, because I<br/>    also liked 46 and 68 better than the others.</p><p>    In the paper, I didn&apos;t mean to give the impression that wide fifths<br/>    are necessarily better melodically under all circumstances -- I was<br/>    writing specifically about a diatonic scale, where wide fifths result<br/>    in significantly narrower-than-12ET diatonic semitones. Several<br/>    times in the paper (pp. 59, 74, 75), I made statements to the effect<br/>    that chromatic semitones in 31-ET could be used to enhance the<br/>    melodic effect of that (narrow-fifth) tuning, so the size of the<br/>    fifths is, under more general circumstances, beside the point.</p><p>    If your tuning has dozens of tones/octave, you then have<br/>    opportunities to alter the mood on the fly by making subtle<br/>    substitutions in your scale subset, so it&apos;s not wise to draw<br/>    conclusions too quickly about one of these tunings vs. another.</p><p>    --George</p><p>    Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>    Messages in this topic (9)<br/>    3.

They<br/>    &gt; can then tune pure to it/them. For nearly unchanged notes,<br/>    &gt; yes I agree plenty of mileage could be gotten out of only one<br/>    &gt; type of &quot;nearly&quot;. I like drawing lines to make the common<br/>    &gt; tones obvious. Then one doesn&apos;t even have to read music (or<br/>    &gt; both clefs) to know that he&apos;s got to match the bari&apos;s previous<br/>    &gt; pitch. Dotted lines make a good nearly, with perhaps a plus<br/>    &gt; or minus sign above them to indicate direction.<br/>    &gt;</p><p>    Carl,</p><p>    I like a lot of your ideas, but we always need to remember what the<br/>    mindset of a stylistic performer is. Everything you are talking about<br/>    comes from the world of POLYPHONY. When everyone is concerned about<br/>    what their particular part is, then your points make sense. And even<br/>    in barbershop there is definitely a bit of that. However,<br/>    barbershoppers do best when they hear themselves as part of a whole.</p><p>    Put further, woodshedders historically were concerned first with what<br/>    the root harmonic movement was and secondly with simply whether they<br/>    were staying on a note or moving. But whether they move a third or<br/>    fifth isn&apos;t important, but what place they have in the new chord.</p><p>    Watch Dave Steven&apos;s &quot;What Are We Trying To Preserve&quot; at <a href="http://barbershop.org">barbershop.org</a><br/>    for a very wonderful entertaining presentation:</p><p>    &lt;a<br/>    href=&quot;<a href="http://stellent.spebsqsa.org/web/groups/public/documents/native/cb_00083.ram">http://stellent.spebsqsa.org/web/groups/public/documents/native/cb_00083.ram</a>&quot;&gt;What<br/>    Are We Trying To Preserve&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>    He discusses a system used by the old folks who did not read music:</p><p>    They basically used a system to say that the chord was &quot;home&quot; or 1, 2,<br/>    3, or 4 away on the 5ths-system (meaning 3 identities). They just<br/>    held up 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 fingers, and everyone knew what that chord<br/>    sounded like and found a note that fit into that chord.</p><p>    That is a great way to work when working in a style which is totally<br/>    based around those progressions.</p><p>    My concept is to get away from everyone treating their own part as the<br/>    focus and go toward listening to the unified result of all the parts.</p><p>    Anyway, recognizing that different sorts of music work differently, I<br/>    feel pretty confident that identifying the root of each chord is<br/>    extremely useful in barbershop specifically. Realize that 95% of all<br/>    barbershop roots fit a very small number of different roots.</p><p>    Main point is I&apos;m not imposing my ideas of what people should know.<br/>    The style is built on the tradition of knowing certain basic chord<br/>    progressions and then knowing how to sing the different identities of<br/>    each chord. So I&apos;m trying to reflect that more clearly. Just because<br/>    classical singers are so polyphonically focused and don&apos;t listen to<br/>    each other doesn&apos;t mean I should compromise my notation to fit that<br/>    mindset.</p><p>    -Aaron</p><p>    Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>    Messages in this topic (12)<br/>    3b.

They<br/>    &gt;&gt; can then tune pure to it/them. For nearly unchanged notes,<br/>    &gt;&gt; yes I agree plenty of mileage could be gotten out of only one<br/>    &gt;&gt; type of &quot;nearly&quot;. I like drawing lines to make the common<br/>    &gt;&gt; tones obvious. Then one doesn&apos;t even have to read music (or<br/>    &gt;&gt; both clefs) to know that he&apos;s got to match the bari&apos;s previous<br/>    &gt;&gt; pitch. Dotted lines make a good nearly, with perhaps a plus<br/>    &gt;&gt; or minus sign above them to indicate direction.<br/>    &gt;<br/>    &gt; Carl,<br/>    &gt;<br/>    &gt; I like a lot of your ideas, but we always need to remember<br/>    &gt; what the mindset of a stylistic performer is. ... When<br/>    &gt; everyone is concerned about what their particular part is,<br/>    &gt; then your points make sense. ... woodshedders historically<br/>    &gt; were concerned first with what the root harmonic movement<br/>    &gt; was and secondly with simply whether they were staying on<br/>    &gt; a note or moving. But whether they move a third or fifth<br/>    &gt; isn&apos;t important, but what place they have in the new chord.</p><p>    Hi Aaron,</p><p>    There&apos;s obviously a disconnect somewhere, because you seem<br/>    to be agreeing with what I said!</p><p>    &gt; He discusses a system used by the old folks who did not read<br/>    &gt; music:<br/>    &gt;<br/>    &gt; They basically used a system to say that the chord was &quot;home&quot;<br/>    &gt; or 1, 2, 3, or 4 away on the 5ths-system (meaning 3 identities).<br/>    //<br/>    &gt; That is a great way to work when working in a style which is totally<br/>    &gt; based around those progressions.</p><p>    Exactly. And not a good way for music that isn&apos;t.</p><p>    &gt; My concept is to get away from everyone treating their own part<br/>    &gt; as the focus and go toward listening to the unified result of all<br/>    &gt; the parts.</p><p>    Such a focus would tend to come from a notation that emphasized<br/>    absolute pitch, would it not? And be discouraged by one that<br/>    emphasized vertical harmony?</p><p>    &gt; Anyway, recognizing that different sorts of music work<br/>    &gt; differently, I feel pretty confident that identifying the<br/>    &gt; root of each chord is extremely useful in barbershop<br/>    &gt; specifically.</p><p>    That&apos;s why the notation I suggested labels all the roots in<br/>    the music.</p><p>    &gt; Just because<br/>    &gt; classical singers are so polyphonically focused and don&apos;t listen to<br/>    &gt; each other doesn&apos;t mean I should compromise my notation to fit that<br/>    &gt; mindset.</p><p>    Where did you get this from?</p><p>    -Carl</p><p>    Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>    Messages in this topic (12)<br/>    4a.

At least as general as the normal<br/>    way of making a MOS in terms of the family of<br/>    scales you can make with it.</p><p>    I vaguely remember that there was some connection<br/>    with n-ets maybe, using those numbers to select<br/>    particular subsets of a larger n-et, or maybe that was<br/>    some other closely related topic, we are talking about<br/>    a discussion that took place over five years ago now<br/>    and my memory of it isn&apos;t that clear. At any rate<br/>    there is a particular construction that<br/>    he is describing there which generates those<br/>    scales in a recursive way.</p><p>    It took a lot of explaining and I came very close to understanding<br/>    it when we had to break off.</p><p>    In that post, he uses a number<br/>    of shorthands like silver weighting etc and his a b c notation,<br/>    all of which have to be explained before one can know what they mean<br/>    - they do refer to particular very specific constructions<br/>    that need to be described and understood, and there<br/>    are many assumed details that one can&apos;t<br/>    know from reading the post, just<br/>    like a mathematical paper relying on<br/>    results and definitions in earlier papers.</p><p>    Also do you have any ideas about his conjecture that<br/>    the only completely rational trivalent scales are the<br/>    ones with an odd number of notes? He may even<br/>    have proved it or got very close<br/>    to doing so, I remember discussing that with<br/>    him too, and it is rather intriguing.</p><p>    In our discussions, we found that it<br/>    takes time on both sides, for the<br/>    mathematician listener to figure out<br/>    what he is saying, also for him to work out<br/>    how to say it and to answer all the questions.<br/>    I think what it is is that he has figured out some of<br/>    the mathematical techniques he needed<br/>    largely for himself, so has got used to rather<br/>    individual ways of presenting it, but whenever I have had the<br/>    opportunity to follow it through, the reasoning<br/>    has been sound, the results interesting, and<br/>    often coming at the ideas with a novel slant.<br/>    There is a lot more to what he says than<br/>    often appears at first sight when one reads it.<br/>    It is well worth the effort on both sides if<br/>    one has the time to do it.</p><p>    If no-one else can describe his technique to me, I<br/>    hope to come back to the discussion<br/>    when I have more time.</p><p>    BTW I did a comprehensive search of the<br/>    SCALA archive for trivalent scales and higher<br/>    valency scales ,and you will still find it somewhere in the<br/>    files area under my name probably.<br/>    I can&apos;t remember how I did it, except that it<br/>    involved some programming and I have a vague<br/>    idea I may have somehow used FTS to prepare<br/>    the list of scales, but can&apos;t remember how.</p><p>    Just did a search of my desktop for &quot;trivalent&quot; and found a note<br/>    about it where I mention that the search turned up<br/>    only one trivalent scale with an even number of notes<br/>    which was:</p><p>    arabic1.scl | From Fortuna. Try C or G major<br/>    &gt;<br/>    &gt; 1/1 100 cents 200 cents 300 cents 350 cents 500 cents 600 cents 700<br/>    cents 800 cents 900<br/>    &gt; cents 1000 cents 1050 cents 2/1<br/>    &gt;<br/>    &gt; Or in 24-tet:<br/>    &gt; 0 2 4 6 7 10 12 14 16 18 20 21 24<br/>    &gt; steps:<br/>    &gt; 2 2 2 1 3 2 2 2 2 2 1 3</p><p>    It also turned up a number of modes of et scales<br/>    as trivalent, and they were all with even<br/>    number of notes, so I wonder if it goes both<br/>    ways, that all et trivalent scales have an<br/>    even number of notes and that all rational<br/>    trivalent scales have an odd number,<br/>    at least the data seems to suggest<br/>    that as a conjecture.</p><p>    Thanks,</p><p>    Robert</p><p>    ----- Original Message -----<br/>    From: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>    To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>    Sent: Wednesday, October 25, 2006 11:50 AM<br/>    Subject: [tuning] Digest Number 4177</p><p>    Welcome to the Alternate Tunings Mailing List.<br/>    Messages In This Digest (6 Messages)<br/>    1a.

Say we start out at A=440, go 20 cents<br/>    flat every other bar for 5 bars, then go 20 cents sharp every<br/>    other bar for 5 bars and end on A=440. The notation would<br/>    show &quot;-100&quot; above the 6th barline and &quot;+-0&quot; above the last<br/>    barline. The point is that this is something that should<br/>    happen naturally if one tunes pure and respects the shifts<br/>    notation (above).

Anyway, people<br/>    &gt; can compare to 31 and see if sharp fifths are really melodically<br/>    &gt; better as George claims.<br/>    &gt;<br/>    &gt; <a href="http://bahamas.eshockhost.com/~xenharmo/midi/examples/kirkwood/">http://bahamas.eshockhost.com/~xenharmo/midi/examples/kirkwood/</a></p><p>    Hi Gene &amp; Robert,</p><p>    I got a chance to listen to the Kirkwood gaps (original &amp; all of the<br/>    retunings) last night (several times) to decide if I had any<br/>    preferences. I observed that 34 is the only tuning that has both a<br/>    good 5/4 and 5/3 and also has the Archytas comma tempered out in the<br/>    upward jump of the fifth between 7/4 and 4/3 (at 0:27-0:28). But I<br/>    can&apos;t say that it&apos;s clearly my favorite for that reason, because I<br/>    also liked 46 and 68 better than the others.</p><p>    In the paper, I didn&apos;t mean to give the impression that wide fifths<br/>    are necessarily better melodically under all circumstances -- I was<br/>    writing specifically about a diatonic scale, where wide fifths result<br/>    in significantly narrower-than-12ET diatonic semitones. Several<br/>    times in the paper (pp. 59, 74, 75), I made statements to the effect<br/>    that chromatic semitones in 31-ET could be used to enhance the<br/>    melodic effect of that (narrow-fifth) tuning, so the size of the<br/>    fifths is, under more general circumstances, beside the point.</p><p>    If your tuning has dozens of tones/octave, you then have<br/>    opportunities to alter the mood on the fly by making subtle<br/>    substitutions in your scale subset, so it&apos;s not wise to draw<br/>    conclusions too quickly about one of these tunings vs. another.</p><p>    --George</p><p>    Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>    Messages in this topic (9)<br/>    3.

At least as general as the normal<br/>    way of making a MOS in terms of the family of<br/>    scales you can make with it.</p><p>    I vaguely remember that there was some connection<br/>    with n-ets maybe, using those numbers to select<br/>    particular subsets of a larger n-et, or maybe that was<br/>    some other closely related topic, we are talking about<br/>    a discussion that took place over five years ago now<br/>    and my memory of it isn&apos;t that clear. At any rate<br/>    there is a particular construction that<br/>    he is describing there which generates those<br/>    scales in a recursive way.</p><p>    It took a lot of explaining and I came very close to understanding<br/>    it when we had to break off.</p><p>    In that post, he uses a number<br/>    of shorthands like silver weighting etc and his a b c notation,<br/>    all of which have to be explained before one can know what they mean<br/>    - they do refer to particular very specific constructions<br/>    that need to be described and understood, and there<br/>    are many assumed details that one can&apos;t<br/>    know from reading the post, just<br/>    like a mathematical paper relying on<br/>    results and definitions in earlier papers.</p><p>    Also do you have any ideas about his conjecture that<br/>    the only completely rational trivalent scales<br/>(Message over 64 KB, truncated)</p></div><h3><a id=67813 href="#67813">ðŸ”—</a>Hudson Lacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@yahoo.com.br&#x3E;</h3><span>10/27/2006 6:31:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert walker escreveu:<br/>&gt; Welcome to the Alternate Tunings Mailing List.Hi Gene,<br/>[...]</p><p>Huh!
