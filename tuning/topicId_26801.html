My questions is what instrumentation do you use to<br/>accomplish this?  As far as I have found out, there are no<br/>synthesizer companies which currently produce any keyboards capable<br/>of Just Intonation ratios.  With guitars, there are only MIDI<br/>controller varieties which would have to connect to a synth in order<br/>to work.  What software are you and others using to achieve these<br/>microtonal capabilities?  That is what I am wondering.  I am<br/>searching for specific software which must be created if it has not<br/>been created already.  So far, most of you have been basically<br/>ignoring all of my messages and ramble on about all of this technical<br/>jargon.  What good are symbols written on paper if you are unable to<br/>hear what you are describing?<br/>  I would appreciate some real help on this one since I have not<br/>found any here before.  There are only 3 types of computer software<br/>for PC which I have found any substantial merit in.  They are the<br/>Midicode Synthesizer, the Phi Music Generator, and the Justonic Pitch<br/>Palette.  All three of these have serious drawbacks.  I am looking<br/>for software which allows full keyboard custom tuning in Hz of each<br/>individual key with any scale length possible.  This software would<br/>also allow for automatic modulation with in the scale when it is<br/>shifted to other keys.  I would also like to know of synth guitars<br/>which have the possibility to be connected to the synth for full<br/>tuning range.<br/>  Midicode Synthesizer has a 64 note scale length limit and has<br/>dynamic retuning.  Dynamic retuning is pathetic because YOU HAVE TO<br/>SET THE KEY NOTE BEFORE YOU PLAY IN THE NEW KEY.  This is ridiculous;<br/>it is not automatic modulation.  The Phi Music Generator has full<br/>keyboard scales of any Hz tuning, but as far as I know, it does not<br/>have automatic modulation or modulation ability to any degree.<br/>Justonic Tuning only has a 12 note scale length limit, but it does<br/>have automatic modulation within certain limitations.  I just<br/>purchased the software, so it will be a while before I can test it.<br/>I talked to the owner, and he said that there are some instances<br/>where the computer cannot recognize what chord/scale is being<br/>played.  This is a setback, but the software seems like the best<br/>alternative out there.<br/>  FINDING THE IDEAL SOFTWARE IS PARAMOUNT TO ME AND SHOULD BE<br/>PARAMOUNT TO ALL OF YOU.  I cannot see why finding software which<br/>truly has infinite possibilities is not of vast importance to you.<br/>Modulation is of prime concern when it comes to pure ratio scale<br/>systems.  You should know this.
