Please also help me plan the test<br/>&gt;scientifically.</p><p>we can construct random sequences of successive and simultaneous<br/>tone comparisons, and have the subject describe whether there was a<br/>change and if so, in what direction. statistical tests can then be<br/>run on the results to determine what the most likely threshold of<br/>discriminability is.</p><p>i would recommend finding such a study in the published professional<br/>acoustic/psychoacoustic literature (many have already been done) and<br/>reproducing it with your students. then you will have a basis for<br/>comparison, and more importantly, sound experimental design. start<br/>with juan roederer&apos;s book, _the physics and psychophysics of music_,<br/>look up JND (just noticeable difference) and follow the citations to<br/>JASA and other sources.</p></div>
