I am DJ Kaeru aka Kaeru Ichiban-a hip hop/drum &apos;n bass/beats/breakbeats producer from Canada. I want to let you all know about the various services and gear I offer over the inet...<br/>Please do not regard this message as spam, because it isn&apos;t. I am a fully legitimate, active member of this group-not some outsider just coming in to spam...anyway..<br/>Spam is where someone sends you junk email to tell you about some kind of scam or get-rich quick scheme. I am just a studio mole that is trying desparately to get his music some exposure. I give everything out for free, and I am not charging any money for anything...so excuse me if I am bothering anyone, but I want to tell you what I have to offer, again, it is all free, so don&apos;t bother trying to flame me or anything, there is really no point, and you aren&apos;t justified to do it anyway because I am truly just trying to contribute something of value to my fellow &quot;netizens&quot; here. Ok-enough waffling! Here are the goods..</p><p>1. My music-beats-tracks-as I mentioned, I am a DJ-producer.
