Being<br/>that the list started somewhere around 6 years ago, for those that<br/>wanted to utilize synths and computers and whatnot, it was a good time<br/>to post that info. Move forward to the present, and there are a lot<br/>more resources at one&apos;s disposal, and it isn&apos;t as hard to get done<br/>what needs to get done.</p><p>I&apos;ve learned one other thing from this, and whether people agree, or<br/>are comfortable with it, I haven&apos;t a clue: it is about the people.</p><p>I&apos;ve been spending a lot of time in a couple other forums, in<br/>decidedly different subject areas, and almost all of what *didn&apos;t*<br/>work - as a community - in MMM works very well. I had given up hope,<br/>but it turns out it was mainly the basic makeup of people who might<br/>have been interested in microtonality that skewed the thing.</p><p>So, not a failure, IMO, but an interesting experiment that has, just<br/>like threads will do, drifted. And, who knows? Something very similar,<br/>with differing members, and differing leadership agendas, might behave<br/>very differently.</p><p>Ok, back to your tunings...</p><p>&lt;3,<br/>Jon</p></div>
