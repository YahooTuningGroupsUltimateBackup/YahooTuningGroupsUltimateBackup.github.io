The pitches of the Utonal/Otonal chord ARE<br/>THE SAME.  Could someone please explain this.  What&apos;s going on??  I&apos;m<br/>not &quot;getting it.&quot;</p><p>I hear identical pitches, but there is some entire elimination of<br/>&quot;roughness&quot; as we go from the Utonal to the Otonal.  Pourquoi?</p><p>What an amazing experiment!  Almost eerie... especially with the &quot;saw.&quot;<br/>But, what&apos;s happening?? How are the pitches the same??  It&apos;s an amazing<br/>&quot;resolution.&quot;  There are really LOTS of compositional possibilities in<br/>this... Has anyone worked extensively with these effects??</p><p>______________ _______ ____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
