And I know the<br/>pleasues of playing Maqam Rast with a tempered approximation<br/>of this at 207-162-127 cents. The baglama tuning Cameron has<br/>reported at 202-168-128 cents, like my tempered version, may<br/>vary here and there from the exact mathematical values, but<br/>the pattern seems to me clear.</p><p>And these tetrachords of the medieval Islamic theorists, as<br/>I&apos;m sure you discuss in your book, are beautiful!</p><p>What you say would also apply to my experience of medieval<br/>European theory, which I&apos;ve been involved in for much longer<br/>than the Near Eastern practice and theory.</p><p>For example, Jacobus of Liege in his _Speculum musicae_<br/>written maybe around 1325, where he was looking back on the<br/>beloved music of his youth and lamenting that in his later<br/>years only the &quot;moderns&quot; were by then getting much<br/>attention, has some incredible insights about consonance and<br/>polyphony which, at least in the 1970&apos;s to 1990&apos;s, weren&apos;t<br/>getting enough notice in analyses of Gothic music.</p><p>One passage you might find of special interest, if it isn&apos;t<br/>in your book, is the explanation in another anonymous<br/>treatise very likely by him from around 1300 called<br/>_Compendium de Musica_ in which he notes that in composing<br/>for three or more voices, the voices forming an octave<br/>should be arranged according to the &quot;natural series&quot; 2-3-4,<br/>so that the fifth (3:2) is below the fourth (4:3).</p><p>Although this is maybe three centuries before the discovery<br/>of the harmonic series, Jacobus with his series of 2-3-4,<br/>like Zarlino some two centuries later with his senario or<br/>series of &quot;sonorous numbers&quot; 1-2-3-4-5-6, is reaching<br/>results similar to those suggested by the harmonic series.<br/>He also notes in the _Speculum musicae_ that a harmonic<br/>division such as 6:4:3 or 12:8:6 (the string ratios for the<br/>&quot;natural series&quot; of 2-3-4, although I haven&apos;t seen this<br/>connection drawn in his writings) is best, remarking in<br/>relation to 12:8:6 that a cube has 12 vertices, 8 corners,<br/>and 6 sides.</p><p>It would be interesting to know if there could be any<br/>&quot;etymology of concepts&quot; linking Jacobus to Zarlino. A rule<br/>the two share is that the simpler or better consonance<br/>should be placed below the more complex one: for Jacobus,<br/>the fifth below the fourth in the perfect three-voice<br/>medieval consonance of 2:3:4 (string ratios 6:4:3); and for<br/>Zarlino, the major third below the minor third in perfect<br/>16th-century consonance of 4:5:6 (string ratios 15:12:10).</p><p>Some years ago I published a two-part article in _1/1_ on<br/>Ugolino of Orvieto and his 17-note Pythagorean tuning<br/>(comparable to that of Safi al-Din maybe 150 years before<br/>Ugolino&apos;s treatise of somewhere around 1425-1440), in which<br/>I discussed the &quot;natural series&quot; of 2-3-4 as presented by<br/>Jacobus as a guide for composing _poliphonia_, possibly one<br/>of the earlier appearances of that Latin term.</p><p>Anyway, your beautiful statement reminded me that while my<br/>focus nowadays is often on Near Eastern music, I shouldn&apos;t<br/>forget my roots in medieval European pratice and theory.</p><p>&gt;  Cris</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2010 2:15:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Kraig (and Cris and Cameron),</p><p>Thank you for reminding me of George Secor&apos;s chord,<br/>which I&apos;m guessing may be the same thing discussed<br/>in his article on his 17-tone well-temperament in<br/>_Xenharmonikon_ 18, pp. 69-70. If so, we&apos;re talking<br/>about 8:9:11:13.

This would fit with a comment<br/>he makes in _Xenharmonikon_ 17 on how a book<br/>on JI by Vogel fails adequately to consider<br/>primes higher than 7 and their role in pure<br/>melody, where Leedy notes that 10:11:12 seems<br/>to show up in various world musics.</p><p>And I&apos;ll quickly add that I listened, encouraged<br/>by this thread, to a near-just 9:12:16:21, and<br/>can look with renewed amazement on suggestions<br/>that it&apos;s necessarily a flaw to derive 7:3 or<br/>the like from a chain of fourths including a<br/>21:16.
