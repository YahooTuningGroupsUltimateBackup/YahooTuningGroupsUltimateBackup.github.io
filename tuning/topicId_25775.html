The band would have been worth seeing solely as an example of<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt;genre (which I&apos;m quite fond of, actually) of guitar-heavy creative<br/>&gt;blues-rock-heavymetal synthesis.  As a major bonus, adding in Jon and<br/>&gt;Brad&apos;s<br/>&gt;use of alternate tunings, chord arrangements, and matching vocals -- the<br/>&gt;experience was astounding.</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/28/2001 5:25:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25775">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/25775</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ditto everything below, and then some.

Brad was<br/>out of the group and Hansford Rowe was playing bass. I think<br/>Jim Mussen was playing drums. Jon was already going for a heavier<br/>sound. Evolution and Swallow are really just an extension of Birdhouse (for<br/>me at least, I&apos;m not speeking for Jon).</p><p>David Beardsley</p></div>
