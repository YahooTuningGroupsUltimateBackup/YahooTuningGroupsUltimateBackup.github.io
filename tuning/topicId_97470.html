I didn&apos;t realize that you were now<br/>in the habit of analyzing things outside of the 256/255 range. If you<br/>are now willing to do so, or if you&apos;re in general willing to<br/>experiment with different tolerance values in your model, then I<br/>apologize and concede my criticism on this point.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Fri, Apr 1, 2011 at 2:01 PM, john777music &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I posted this earlier but it never got through, second try.<br/>&gt; I was using a +/-6.776 cents (256/255) accuracy in my analysis of the good dyads in EDOs 4 to 24.
