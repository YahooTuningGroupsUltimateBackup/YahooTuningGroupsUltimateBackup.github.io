At the root of all this is the unconscious urge to try<br/>&gt;&gt; out the new resources independently, to wrest from them<br/>&gt;&gt; possibilities of constructing forms, to produce with them<br/>&gt;&gt; alone all the effects of a clear style, of a compact, lucid<br/>&gt;&gt; and comprehensive presentation of the musical idea. ... the<br/>&gt;&gt; chance of enjoying whatever can *only* be attained by the<br/>&gt;&gt; new resources when the old ones are excluded!</p><p>putting these two together, it seems to me that Schoenberg<br/>was saying that his new &quot;atonal&quot; style was an attempt to<br/>produce music illustrating primarily ratios-of-11 in various<br/>combinations with 7-limit ratios.</p><p>an analysis of a bingo-card lattice of 11-edo as a<br/>representation of 7,11-prime-space shows that it represents<br/>ratios of this prime-space *very* well!</p><p>this can also be seen on the error graphs on my webpage:<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/edo-prime-error.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/edo-prime-error.htm</a></p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=58503 href="#58503">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2005 4:18:54 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@t...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; an analysis of a bingo-card lattice of 11-edo as a<br/>&gt; representation of 7,11-prime-space shows that it represents<br/>&gt; ratios of this prime-space *very* well!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this can also be seen on the error graphs on my webpage:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/edo-prime-error.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/edo-prime-error.htm</a></p><p>in his 1927 lecture (published in Enlgish in 1934 as<br/>_Problems of Harmony_), Schoenberg derives the 12-edo<br/>chromatic scale from the first 13 partials of C, F, and G.</p><p>an 11,13-prime-space bingo-card lattice, and my<br/>EDO prime-error page, show that 13-edo is a good choice<br/>for representing 11,13-prime-space.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=58508 href="#58508">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2005 9:25:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; an analysis of a bingo-card lattice of 11-edo as a<br/>&gt;&gt; representation of 7,11-prime-space shows that it represents<br/>&gt;&gt; ratios of this prime-space *very* well!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; this can also be seen on the error graphs on my webpage:<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/edo-prime-error.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/edo-prime-error.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;in his 1927 lecture (published in Enlgish in 1934 as<br/>&gt;_Problems of Harmony_), Schoenberg derives the 12-edo<br/>&gt;chromatic scale from the first 13 partials of C, F, and G.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;an 11,13-prime-space bingo-card lattice, and my<br/>&gt;EDO prime-error page, show that 13-edo is a good choice<br/>&gt;for representing 11,13-prime-space.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what you mean by 11,13-prime-space.

In fact,<br/>based on the limited listening I&apos;ve done, his theorizing was<br/>remarkably detrimental to his composing.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
