My<br/>ideal composer would be something like:  the king of the east meets Ralph Vaughn Williams meets<br/>Alban Berg (with the accent being on Vaughn Williams).  Does such an accomplishment exist?</p><p>Also, I have noticed that in my quest for tonal and tuning perfection that I find the perfect<br/>tones and tunings I am seeking in diatonic music.  I am thinking that the modes (dorian,<br/>phrygian,etc) in the keys (a, a#, b, c, etc.) produce the apperception (subjective experience)<br/>of microtones.  I also experience this in vocal and orchestral pieces where the timbre is<br/>oftened changed.<br/>Are there are any harmonic studies of this phenomena I am experiencing?</p><p>Any help on the above subjects would be greatly appreciated.</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2000 4:18:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Troubledoor wrote:</p><p>&gt; I am looking for a microtonal composer who writes<br/>&gt; without the dissonance of Schoenberg.</p><p>Try Lou Harrison.

From the webpage, all I get is that he does choir<br/>music.  I&apos;d really like to hear Harry Partch meets Arvo Part meets Schoenberg.  All 72 notes of<br/>the ideal Pythagorean scale singing like Arvo Part&apos;s &quot;Miserere&quot;.<br/>Which brings me to another idea.  Arvo Part&apos;s &quot;Miserere&quot; is not microtonal officially yet it<br/>sounds just as free and beautiful.<br/>Maybe its impossible.  I doubt it.  When Pythagorus made the lambda, an array of harmonic<br/>divisions, it implied the 12 tone tablets a tone row writer might make (except that I am<br/>dreaming of a 72 tone array).  I think that China probably had all 72 notes singing and that it<br/>was forgotten by history because of the Tannhauser thing.</p><p>David Beardsley wrote:</p><p>&gt; Or maybe David Hykes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; * D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>&gt; * 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>&gt; * <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.
