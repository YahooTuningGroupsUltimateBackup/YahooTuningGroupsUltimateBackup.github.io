An interval or sonority may be at once<br/>relatively &quot;concordant&quot; but unstable, i.e. a &quot;dual-purpose sonority&quot;<br/>as I might also describe it.</p><p>An example, maybe analogous to the 4:5:6:7 in the music you are<br/>describing, John, would be the _quinta fissa_ or fifth &quot;split&quot; by the<br/>middle voice of sonority into two thirds, e.g. F3-A3-C4 (64:81:96);<br/>and also the major ninth &quot;split&quot; into two fifths, e.g. F3-C4-G4<br/>(4:6:9). Both sonorities are relatively blending, but definitely<br/>unstable, inviting resolution either to a complete 3-limit trine<br/>(2:3:4), e.g. E3-B3-E4 for the first sonority and F3-C4-F4 for the<br/>second, or to the trine&apos;s choicest interval of the fifth.</p><p>Paul, your comments about 4:5:6:7 as a stable tetrad in decatonic<br/>music nicely illustrate how some terms routinely used to describe<br/>sonorities can carry implications about stability/instability which<br/>may fit one style of music but not another.</p><p>Thus the term &quot;triad&quot; fits the 4:5:6 sonority in Renaissance-Romantic<br/>style, tending to imply that this is the richest stable concord. In a<br/>Gothic setting, the term _quinta fissa_ (or its English translation<br/>&quot;split fifth&quot;) describes the mildly unstable 64:81:96, which has the<br/>same intervals (5 + M3 + m3) but a different role.</p><p>Similarly the term &quot;dominant seventh&quot; fits 20:25:30:36 or 4:5:6:7 in<br/>various tonal styles where triads are the most complex stable<br/>sonorities, while &quot;complete tetrad&quot; fits 4:5:6:7 in a decatonic style.</p><p>One metaphor I sometimes use to express the relationship between<br/>stable concords and dual-purpose sonorities is that of &quot;saturation&quot;<br/>and &quot;supersaturation.&quot; In a Gothic style, a 2:3:4 trine marks the<br/>point of saturation or complete stable concord; in tonal music, a<br/>4:5:6 triad. A Gothic 64:81:96 or 4:6:9, or a tonal 4:5:6:7, is<br/>alluringly blending but &quot;supersaturated,&quot; somehow too complex to<br/>be stable.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=11545 href="#11545">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2000 3:46:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Margo, for your comments.  The analogies you mention seem very<br/>on-target.  The only quibble I might have is with your statement that<br/>a 64:81:96 chord is &quot;relatively blending&quot;.  To my ear the Pythagorean<br/>thirds are discordant in and of themselves.  Certainly that sensation<br/>reinforces your assertion that resolution is needed!  As for the 4:6:9<br/>chord, I agree that it is both smooth and in need of resolution.</p><p>In discussing dominant 7ths, you give two tuning possibilities,<br/>20:25:30:36 and 4:5:6:7.  The first of these puts the 7th degree at<br/>9/10 of the root above, the second puts it at 7/8.  What about the<br/>intermediate tuning, 8/9?  To my ear this last is discordant but<br/>tolerable, where the 9/10 is VERY high.  Is 9/10 more &quot;historical&quot;?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
