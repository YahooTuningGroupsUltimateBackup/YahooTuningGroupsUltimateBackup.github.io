I have performed using different temperaments, investigated<br/>the music/writings of Harry Partch (thanks to my connection with Gunnar<br/>Johansen), studied Arabic music with the late Jafran Jones and listened to<br/>much (though the amount of music is HUGE).  Composing music is another thing<br/>and I have long felt constrained by limitations of equipment and technology,<br/>thus I stick with 12TET.  My great dream (sadly rendered unlikely by my lack<br/>of carpentry skills) is to build instruments after Harry Partch&apos;s designs.<br/>On the other hand I would dearly love to be able to work on the Polytone of<br/>Arthur Fickenscher, but I expect that will never happen.</p><p>My primary focus these days is on Baroque through Romantic tuning and<br/>temperament to which I owe a great debt to Owen Jorgensen among others.<br/>Next month, for example, I plan to record on an 1848 Broadwood and am<br/>working at convincing the technician to prepare it in the Young temperament.<br/>A further project involves the Well Tempered Clavier on a variety of<br/>instruments using several different temperaments.</p><p>However, I am also very interested in the philosophic/spiritual/historical<br/>issues of tuning and indeed at this moment I am rereading The Myth of<br/>Invariance.</p><p>Finally, it seems to me that music education sadly neglects tuning and<br/>tuning theory for reasons obscure to me.  I recall with great distaste<br/>having to do ear training/dictation exercises on an out of tune piano played<br/>by a bad pianist/theory teacher.  Needless to say I always had a &apos;bad ear&apos; a<br/>fact I am now quite proud of...In all of the years I studied I do not recall<br/>a single mention in courses of tuning or temperament (except for a piano<br/>technology course where only ET was considered).

There is an unusual current of inspiration in<br/>Partch from a lot of directions (maybe his hundredth birthday, a week<br/>from today?), and you may yet be pulled back into that world as well.</p><p>Enough blather from me -- glad to have you, and have fun!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Seth Austen &#x3C;klezmusic@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2001 3:47:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 6/18/01 12:25 AM, <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> at <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 12<br/>&gt; Date: Sun, 17 Jun 2001 15:38:32 -0700<br/>&gt; From: Kraig Grady &lt;<a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Re: Microtonal Music<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Seth!<br/>&gt; Is he homophobic or is it a comment on homophobia. i sense he laughin at it,<br/>&gt; not glorifying<br/>&gt; it.</p><p>Kraig,</p><p>That&apos;s a good question, I&apos;ll keep it in mind the next time I hear his music<br/>to see if that might be the perspective he&apos;s coming from.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a><br/><a href="mailto:klezmusic@earthlink.net">klezmusic@earthlink.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2001 11:30:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon wrote,</p><p>&gt; &gt; But of course, and I know many people, most all of them musicians,<br/>&gt; &gt; who know and like much of the music from that era *except* the<br/>Dead<br/>&gt; &gt; for this very intonation reason (well, and others), but this<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t explain how SO many people could have had their lives<br/>&gt; &gt; changed by a band whose intonation prevents YOU from appreciating<br/>&gt; &gt; them (Caps are only for clarity, not shouting).
