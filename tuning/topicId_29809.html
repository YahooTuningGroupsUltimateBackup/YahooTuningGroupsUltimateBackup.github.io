Soon he will have an article<br/>describing the way Protopopoff&apos;s tritone theory fits into his<br/>expanded notion of microtonality:</p><p>Dear Joseph,</p><p>Of course you can post my article on Protopopoff on the tuning list.<br/>I would always welcome additional publicity and the Ukrainian journal<br/>will certainly not mind.</p><p>The microtonal Yavorsky/Protopopoff ideas are very interesting, but<br/>you have to keep in mind that they are the next step (or the next<br/>grade in school) after his ideas on tonal and atonal music (which I<br/>have wrote about extensively in my article). I promised Johnny a<br/>while ago to help him get access to these ideas. While it would be a<br/>bit difficult to summarize these ideas during the next few days, I do<br/>want to give them some attention. I think that the best way for me to<br/>disseminate these ideas is to write a short article or paper about<br/>them, summarizing them and giving prospective composers ideas on how<br/>to use them practically in their compositions.</p><p>Protopopoff himself used Yavorsky&apos;s ideas (chiefly applicable to tonal<br/>music) in his own compositions (which were not tonal, but chromatic<br/>like late Scriabin), so the next extension of that would be for<br/>someone to write some microtonal compositions using Protopopoff&apos;s<br/>microtonal ideas.</p><p>To make a long story short, the microtonal ideas also involve<br/>dissonant intervals like tritones resolving into consonant intervals<br/>like major or minor thirds, except that in the new resolutions<br/>microtones are used (equal tempered ones - quarter-tones, third-<br/>tones, eighth tones) in particular cases. The thing that I have to<br/>figure out is in what particular case what microtones I use. Once I<br/>will read about it more extensively, I will write to you about it,<br/>and then write an article about it.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Anton</p></div>
