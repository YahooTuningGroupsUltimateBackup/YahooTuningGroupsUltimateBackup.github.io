I think that this is, in part, unresolveable, but one shouldn&apos;t lose faith in face of an inevitable lack of resolution.

In my experience, those listeners and musicians with intensive experience in sound recording, and in particular, commercial sound recording, have a lot of nuts and bolts information to offer, but also seem to bring in the greatest prejudices in this regard; in the end they are often re-producing cliches that ought not be left unchallenged.</p><p>But I do believe that there are some strategies to deal with this.</p><p>The first is to assume that the soundfont at hand is good enough for some music, and that making it work for your music is more a matter of adding musical elements -- dynamics, phrasing, rubato, perhaps a bit of portamento -- than of tinkering with the font itself.

In electronic forms, these effects need not be overstated, in fact, they should probably be on the subtle side.

I would just like to add that there are certain facts about<br/>human perception that do play into this well beyond prejudices about<br/>recording.  Constant noticeable vibrato, for example, will always be<br/>fatigueing to human ears, even though many will choose to suffer<br/>through it.  Likewise, extreme compression is also fatigueing.  I can<br/>listen to the whole range from very computerized to humanly expressive<br/>and variable, and I do definitely still appreciate the in-between.<br/>Personally, I find extreme vibrato to be really distrurbing and distracting<br/>in either case, including in a live performance.  Sure, this is still subjective,<br/>and I can&apos;t speak for everyone.  But I&apos;ll certainly do what I can to ask<br/>everyone, electronic MIDI composers, and live instrumentalists both<br/>to please use anything beyond very subtle vibrato only as an ornamental<br/>effect.  A flute player I heard in college drove me to nearly having an<br/>actual headache playing one of my favorite composers: Piazzolla.<br/>I ask you to please believe me: I wasn&apos;t trying to focus on the vibrato<br/>and have a hang-up about it, I was trying to enjoy the music.</p><p>An extreme example of this would be if I was visiting Gene and<br/>he played a piece for me, but turned his speakers up to 120dB<br/>which also distorted his speakers.  It would be painful, and I&apos;d<br/>rather leave than listen.  There&apos;s NOTHING intellectual here.<br/>Gene&apos;s  examples were not at all *that* bad, but my simple point<br/>is that it isn&apos;t about expression or subtlety (though those elements<br/>will certainly make anything more broadly accessible), it&apos;s about<br/>recordings simply not being excessively fatigueing on the ears,<br/>first and foremost.  Though I&apos;ll still push for anyone bothering<br/>to record trying to make it as nice as they realistically can.</p><p>-Aaron</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Wolf &lt;djwolf@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I may step in here.
