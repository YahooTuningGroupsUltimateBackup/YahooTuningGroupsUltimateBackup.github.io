It<br/>isn&apos;t all decimal nominals, but I think having D and A where they should<br/>be makes up for this.  I gave it a quick try last night, and it sounds<br/>good.</p><p>If you really want to tune to 72-equal, it&apos;ll probably be:</p><p>D#+33<br/>C-33<br/>F+50<br/>D+0<br/>A+0<br/>F+50</p><p>But I don&apos;t think anybody has a 72-equal guitar to try it out on.  It<br/>might even work on a normal fretting.  Stranger things have happened,<br/>only two spring to mind.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2001 4:57:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve changed the way I tune my guitar strings for easy Miracles.

Even ignoring the accidental, if it did the same sort of thing<br/>I did with the Miracle-10 keyboard mapping, the six strings from low<br/>to high would be<br/>EADGBE -&gt; 6 0 4 8 1 6<br/>Not that I think that would be a particularly good tuning for a<br/>Miracle guitar.</p><p>So you&apos;ve got EADGBE -&gt;  7  0&lt;  4  7  2  5<br/>So the intervals between strings are<br/>n3-P4-n3-d5-n3<br/>|9:11|3:4|9:11|7:10|9:11|<br/>Is that right?</p><p>What were you using previously?</p><p>If I were designing a Blackjack guitar I&apos;d want to keep the number of<br/>different notes to a minimum, to avoid too many split or redundant<br/>frets.<br/>How about<br/> n3-P4-n3-n3-P4<br/>7  0&lt; 4  7  0&lt; 4</p></div>
