A few years back, I wrote a<br/>composition in it. A recording of it can be found here:</p><p><a href="http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/students/mbattaglia/Senior_Recital/1-01%20Sand%20Prism.mp3">http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/students/mbattaglia/Senior_Recital/1-01%20Sand%20Prism.mp3</a></p><p>(a little messy, but oh well, this was a few years ago and I was<br/>pretty nervous :) )</p><p>The MOS is, as far as 12-equal is concerned, every note except for<br/>4/3. So it&apos;s this:</p><p>100.0<br/>200.0<br/>300.0<br/>400.0<br/>600.0<br/>700.0<br/>800.0<br/>900.0<br/>1000.0<br/>1100.0<br/>1200.0</p><p>I&apos;ve been assuming the generator here is 100 cents and I&apos;ve been using<br/>it as something like a 2.3.5.7.17.19 subgroup temperament.<br/>- You get 16:17:18:19:20 in there, but the 19/16 also doubles as<br/>75/64, because you can use it in chords like C-E-B-D#. This means that<br/>76/75 vanishes.<br/>- The 17/16 also doubles as 135/128, because you can use it in chords<br/>like C-E-G-B-D-F#-A-C#, so 136/135 vanishes.<br/>- If two generators gets you to 9/8, and four gets you to 5/4, then<br/>81/80 vanishes.<br/>- If three generators gets you to 6/5, which it does between the 15/8<br/>and the 9/4, then that means that 19/16 and 6/5 are equated, so 96/95<br/>vanishes.<br/>- If two 4/3&apos;s gets you to 7/4, which was kind of how I was sort of<br/>trying to use it then 64/63 vanishes.</p><p>The problem: we&apos;re at rank 1 now. Whoops. So let&apos;s ditch the last<br/>comma, and say that that isn&apos;t 7/4. OK. But now we have a rank 2<br/>temperament with period 100 cents. Oops. Wait a sec, let&apos;s try this<br/>again. If four generators going up gets us 5/4, and three generators<br/>going up gets us 6/5, then 7 generators gets us 3/2. But in the<br/>initial MOS I gave, five generators going down gets us 3/2. So we&apos;re<br/>in 12-equal again.</p><p>So is there no useful way to derive a linear temperament from all of<br/>this that I&apos;m missing? Or is this just a case of a scale that needs to<br/>be rank-1 to actually work as advertised?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2011 12:31:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; So is there no useful way to derive a linear temperament from all of<br/>&gt; this that I&apos;m missing?

The POTE tuning for the generator is 28.893 cents, and 2/84 for the generator, with a period of 7/84, looks good to me, though 1/36 might help you escape the question of why in hell don&apos;t you use compton temperament instead.</p></div>
