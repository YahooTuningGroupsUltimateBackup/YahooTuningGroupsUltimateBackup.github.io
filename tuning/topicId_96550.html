On the contrary, not the funeral, but the feast  pentatonic tuning of the West African Bala can&apos;t escape to the semifourth pentatonic as one of its models, if not the main and typical one.<br/>I will just relate an anecdote about it :<br/>Two Bala and Djembe fola girls near my place have a African music school, and two nice balafons they brought from Mali. They were going back to Burkina Faso and Mali and wanted to bring back more balafons. But how to have them tuned with the first instruments ?<br/>I found that these tunings were super good and I said to them I would lend them a small tubular bell set they would be able to carry with them, to present to the Bala maker. This is what they did and they came back with 2 more balafons in tune with the first ones. But not with my little tubular bells carillon, because the luthier loved it so much that they gave it to him.<br/>What was this tuning ?</p><p>! neutr_pent2.scl<br/>!<br/>Quasi-Neutral Pentatonic 2, 15/13 x 52/45 in each trichord, after Dudon<br/>5<br/>!<br/>15/13<br/>4/3<br/>3/2<br/>45/26<br/>2/1</p><p>I found this model in many other African Balas, and I have also done plenty of music myself with sequences of those since the early years of my photosonic disks.<br/>I said what are my names for them, now you guys can do what you want, but you won&apos;t get me in calling those &quot;Barbados&quot; tunings.<br/>- - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>Gene wrote :<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t presented any hobbit scales in a while, but this one is &gt; worth looking at if the recent discussion of island tempering and &gt; the Archipelago interested you.
