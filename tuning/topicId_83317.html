Actually the name does make sense: the history of<br/>Vallotti&apos;s temperament, like many other systems, is quite complicated. To<br/>make a long history short, it was devised and used by Vallotti and others<br/>from the 1730&apos;s on in the Veneto in Italy: it consisted of tempering the 6<br/>diatonic fifths F_C_G_D_A_E_B by 1/6 Syntonic comma, leaving the other<br/>fifths pure. Since that would not close the Circle (by the Schisma or<br/>difference between the two commas, approx. 2 Cents), one of the fifths was<br/>slightly tempered to that effect. In later years Barca and others proposed<br/>either to spread that slight correction by tempering every pure fifth by 1/3<br/>of a Cent, an almost inaudibly amount, or else to temper the 6 diatonic<br/>fifths by 1/6 Pythagorean comma, which is the easiest-to-tune variant used<br/>nowadays. Nobody can tell the difference between the three in performance,<br/>not even tuners. Very slightly favouring the flats, many modern musicians<br/>have found Vallotti it an ideal temperament for J.S.Bach.</p><p>Half a century later Young proposed the same sistem, shifted 1 fifth<br/>clockwise, i.e. tempering C_G_D_A_E_B_F#. Very slightly favouring the<br/>sharps, this temperament is better for some Baroque music.</p><p>Nowadays Vallotti/Young is used to refer to all the variants, and also to<br/>specifically to Young&apos;s particular one.</p><p>Kind regards</p><p>Claudio<br/><a href="http://temper.braybaroque.ie/">http://temper.braybaroque.ie/</a></p><p>PS: (&quot;Vallotti/Young&quot; occurs 62 times in my U.T.

Yet<br/>that is precisely what this temperament is best at, and is much likely (NOT<br/>proven) to have been in use. We know (from Vallotti&apos;s letters and later from<br/>organ tuning documents all many years before the publication by Tartini)<br/>that Vallotti&apos;s original system was in use from the 1730&apos;s in Italy&apos;s<br/>Veneto. It was later discussed between him and others with no less than two<br/>variants, and though a &quot;clockwise shift&quot; (i.e. Young 2) was not specifically<br/>mentioned, it is historically likely. Its use in Germany is justified<br/>because it resembles (though it is not identical) to quite a few of<br/>Neidhardt&apos;s proposals, but they have some serious issues (making Neidhardt<br/>unlikely to achieve accuracy in pre-beat-rate times) that are resolved in<br/>Vallotti. As for Young, his 2nd system is not only a variant of Vallotti but<br/>also a VERY obvious variant of Werckmeister&apos;s III (see my UT p.127) and this<br/>is the main reason why its use is justified for Late Baroque German music.</p><p>As for Young knowing about Vallotti, can&apos;t tell: do not have here the<br/>original text by Young, but I have read quite a few accounts and do not<br/>recall that anybody noticed any reference to Vallotti in Young. Besides, by<br/>the 1800&apos;s the main source for Young would be Tartini, who described the<br/>original version by Vallotti, 1/6 S.c-based, not the corrected 1/6 P.c.<br/>version which is identical to Young shifted. As for what Young had in mind<br/>for use in his time, it is not really relevant, because his work was largely<br/>ignored. It is well documented that in his Beethoven times everybody would<br/>tune in E.T. except a few still attached to meantone in English-speaking<br/>countries and Latin-speaking old church organs. Circular temperaments were<br/>no longer in use and the only sources discussing them in the 1800&apos;s<br/>according to Barbieri&apos;s research are in Italy where anyway they were a small<br/>minority in a prevailing E.T. scenario. (All this is clearly explained in my<br/>pp. 166-173).</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Claudio</p></div><h3><a id=83354 href="#83354">ðŸ”—</a>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/3/2009 4:03:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;     A question for Claudio, or anyone else who cares to answer: why is the<br/>&gt;     Vallotti-Young temperament so-called? On the face of it, the name<br/>&gt;     doesn&apos;t make much sense.</p><p>Vallotti&apos;s layout has 1/6 comma 5ths from F-C-G-D-A-E-B, and all the<br/>other notes are arranged in pure 5ths from either side of that. (Technically, he specified it as 1/6 syntonic comma, and there&apos;s a schisma to burn off within the pure 5ths; but, everybody does it now as if it were 1/6 Pythagorean comma, for simplicity.)</p><p>Young&apos;s presentation (1800/1807) reproduced at<br/><a href="http://harpsichords.pbworks.com/f/Young.html">http://harpsichords.pbworks.com/f/Young.html</a><br/>gives no indication that he was aware of Vallotti&apos;s work.</p><p>Nevertheless, his first (and preferred) temperament puts 10 of the 12<br/>notes in the same places as Vallotti.  The only differences are that his<br/>F is slightly lower, and B slightly higher.  Among other niceties, this<br/>gives less harsh major 3rds B-D# and Db-F than Vallotti has.</p><p>The complete specification works out to: C-G-D-A-E 1/6 Pythagorean comma; E-B-F# 1/12; Gb-Db-Ab-Eb-Bb pure; Bb-F-C 1/12.  (An easy way to do it in practice is to set Vallotti first, and then simply nudge the F downward to an average spot within Bb-F-C, and the B upward to be average within E-B-F#.  That&apos;s about 15 seconds of work on a harpsichord.)</p><p>His second temperament, which he said is the simpler way of getting &quot;nearly the same effect&quot;, has only six notes in common with Vallotti: C, G, D, A, E, and B.  The other six (F#/Gb, C#/Db, G#/Ab, D#/Eb, A#/Bb, and E#/F) are all lower than in Vallotti.</p><p>They are both easy to do by ear, without needing Young&apos;s monochord lengths.

My memory of<br/>finding your book Unequal Temperaments was momentous, many years ago.  Long since<br/>then, my ideas have taken new directions.  To that end I have written a book<br/>called &quot;Bach and Tuning&quot; in which your name does come up a few times.</p><p>I particularly like your support of the 81/64 ditone when others have shown<br/>it disdain (Rasch).  However, wonderful was, and is, your book, one should<br/>not expect 100% agreement.</p><p>&quot;I stand by my previous post.<br/>IMHO, Vallotti and VallottiYoung:<br/>- - have  A LOT to do with Bach&apos;s music: I substantiated this in Early<br/>Music back in 1981 and much more detail is shown with full detail in my book.&quot;</p><p>Pushing back Vallotti tuning to Bach when Werckmeister III is SO MUCH MORE<br/>LIKELY for reasons such as chronology, vicinity, profession, and the simple<br/>fact that it works eminently well for Bach, is unpersuasive.  Perhaps I am<br/>missing something, but all the &quot;circumstantial&quot; evidence supports<br/>Werckmeister III tuning in my reading of history.</p><p>&quot;Some important points:<br/>- Vallotti&apos;s circle of fifths are a &quot;natural&quot; variant of Werckmeister III<br/>- Vallotti&apos;s circle of major thirds are similar to temperaments by<br/>Neidhardt&quot;</p><p>Neidhardt is entirely variant on Werckmeister III, and so then are all<br/>circular but unequal well temperaments.  This offers little regarding Bach.<br/>Werckmeister III is a variant of equal temperament in that Andreas Werckmeister<br/>first considered ET before publishing his first book in 1681.</p><p>As much as I love Vallotti for Tartini and Brahms, it is a travesty on<br/>music it was not intended for.  I would include Bach in this assessment.</p><p>all best in discovering histrorical musical truths with value in<br/>contemporary performance.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>- Vallotti already mentioned his temperament in letters in the 1730&apos;s,<br/>decades before Tartini included it in his treatise<br/>- Church organs in Italy were tuned to Vallotti around 1750.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Claudio<br/>**************The Average US Credit Score is 692.

I already demonstrated that in this article:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/outline.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/outline.html</a><br/>and the basic speculative point about organ conversion was in one of Mark Lindley&apos;s _New Grove_ articles before that.</p><p>But, let&apos;s take a step back.  I believe some people are over-thinking this.  Let&apos;s look at some simple and practical points:</p><p>- Mid-17th-century keyboard music (music as evidence!) already demands the enharmonic flexibility to play notes interchangeably: A#/Bb, E#/F, D#/Eb, G#/Ab, C#/Db, F#/Gb, and more rarely C/B#.  A# and D# are required to play in keys as simple as E minor.  Ab and Db come up whenever we start in G minor or C minor (or F minor!) and do normal musical things.  (And I say &quot;minor&quot; here, fully aware that it was more modally based than that, but making the point about the *scales* in practical use...and because all those accidentals outside the mode got written in as needed, anyway.)  Wherever those enharmonic pairs of notes got used within the same piece, or the same small collection, there was likely some moderate way of tuning so the compromised pitch on that keyboard lever could be played adequately as either named note.</p><p>- Good musicians have never needed &quot;permission&quot; from treatises or theoreticians, or any other mathematically-inclined individuals, to do things in practice that sound good in the music they are facing (or composing or improvising).</p><p>- The conventional keyboard layout, assuming no split keys, is symmetrical across D.  (It&apos;s also symmetrical across G#/Ab, but let&apos;s see it from the perspective of a natural note.)</p><p>- A symmetrical system is easy to do in practice, working symmetrically.   It is also easy to check, mirroring the quality of any interval on either side of D, or on either side of G#/Ab.</p><p>- Without getting caught up in any numbers, it is easy to tune well by simply listening to and comparing the *quality* of intervals, averaging out their relative spiciness by trial and error...not needing to count any beats.</p><p>- Easy systems tend to win, especially with beginners and intermediate musicians.</p><p>So, try this one:</p><p>- Get middle C from your reference source.</p><p>- Tune E from it, a little bit wide from pure...i.e. as much as you know it needs to be, for the next steps to work out...where it&apos;s giving a bit of vibrato, but not yet high enough to sound rough.</p><p>- Pure E octave down to tenor E.</p><p>- Put tenor G#/Ab at the spot where E-G# and Ab-C both sound equally bright and spicy.</p><p>- From that Ab, tune pure 5ths or 4ths: Eb, Bb, F.  Your F should be pretty good with the C, wobbling a little bit, but gently.</p><p>- From that G#, tune pure 5ths or 4ths: C#, F#, B.  Your B should be pretty good with the E, wobbling a little bit, but gently.</p><p>- Almost done, already.  Put middle D midway between Bb and F#, so its quality D-F# and Bb-D is equally spicy.</p><p>- Put G where it averages out quality from both C and D.</p><p>- Put A where it averages out quality from both D and E.</p><p>- Check that all of F-C-G-D-A-E-B by 5ths or 4ths sound similar in quality, all gently impure, but not enough to bother anybody.  If something is off, go back a few steps and correct your error.</p><p>- Finish the rest of the keyboard by octaves.  Check 4ths and 5ths along the way if you want to get really good octaves....</p><p>Voila, that&apos;s the symmetrical layout (aka &quot;Vallotti&quot;) working only by practical listening skills.  I did it on a harpsichord this morning in 11 minutes, easily.</p><p>And if you want to refine it a little bit, go back to the B and the F. Nudge the B ever so slightly upward so both of E-B and B-F# have a hardly perceptible impurity.  Do the same for F, downward, so Bb-F and F-C are both slightly impure (instead of having it all in F-C).  Your B-D# and Db-F are now better than they were, at hardly any cost, and you&apos;ve also made the 5ths F-C and E-B more gently tempered than they were.</p><p>Voila, that&apos;s Young 1.  It even matches up with the way Young described it: &quot;It appears to me, that every purpose may be answered, by making the third C : E too sharp by a quarter of a comma, which will not offend the nicest ear; E : G#, and Ab : C, equal; F# : A# too sharp by a comma; and the major thirds of all the intermediate keys more or less perfect, as they approach more or less to C in the order of modulation. The fifths are perfect enough in every system.&quot;</p><p>- C to E put as sharp as you know it needs to be, to work out, without offending even the nicest ear....</p><p>- G#/Ab midway inside the major 6th E-C.</p><p>- F#-A# &quot;too sharp by a comma&quot; because both those notes come from four pure 5ths in succession.  (G#-D#-A#, and G#-C#-F#)</p><p>- All the other major 3rds going gradually smaller toward C-E, on both sides (around this symmetrical layout).</p><p>The circumstantial evidence of *musicianship* suggests that people could have been doing this in the 17th century: because their music requires such flexibility, and because it&apos;s so easy to do, without needing any written-down notes about string lengths or commas or any other mathematical apparatus.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=83385 href="#83385">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2009 9:33:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brad Lehman &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; - Easy systems tend to win,<br/>&gt; especially with beginners and intermediate musicians....<br/>&gt;....

He knows very well that I have been tuning harpsichords professionally by ear for more than 25 years, efficiently and with care for detail.  The bearing section takes only the first 4 or 5 minutes (with any reasonable temperament!), and all the rest of the work is octaves.  [Tables of made-up calculations to the nth decimal place do NOT count as &quot;reasonable&quot; temperaments for that efficient work, though.  That&apos;s ludicrous, when dealing with harpsichords that are only going to stay in best tune for only a couple of hours at best.]</p><p>A point of my posting this morning was simply that &quot;Vallotti&quot; and &quot;Young 1&quot; ARE both very easy to put onto a harpsichord in very few minutes, WITH GOOD ACCURACY and checking all the 5ths and 4ths along the way (as I always do), by a person who knows how to handle a tuning lever.</p><p>Other skilled harpsichord tuners here are welcome to corroborate my remarks about the feasibility of speed and accuracy, from their own experience.  If it&apos;s this easy to perform the task efficiently now, entirely by ear (with no mathematical calculations), why wouldn&apos;t it be similarly easy for 17th century musicians to do the same?</p><p>Maybe the 17th century experts were even better at it than we are today, because THEIR time wasn&apos;t being wasted by personal attacks in public every single time they said something.  They were allowed to deliver their expert opinions and their work.  And through apprenticeships or guilds, they probably had more focused time available to train their skills, too.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=83399 href="#83399">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/5/2009 3:28:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brad Lehman&quot; &lt;bpl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; - Easy systems tend to win,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; especially with beginners and intermediate musicians....<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;....

Pedantically I would say then, not that Vallotti favours the flats, but that Bach is better served by a temperament that favours the flats, and Vallotti does this in comparison with Young 2.  In this regard, has anyone suggested transposing Vallotti down a 5th instead of up a 5th?  Or a compromise between this and Vallotti?  (Just as, I see on your website, there is a Barbour proposal that is a compromise between Vallotti and Young 2.)</p><p>I would like to mention that I do have some more thoughts in this area, but I am just trying to weigh up whether they are likely to be of interest to members, before posting anything.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Steve M.</p></div>
