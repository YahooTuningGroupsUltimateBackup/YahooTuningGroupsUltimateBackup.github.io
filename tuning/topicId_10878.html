It didn&apos;t go all the way<br/>&gt; back to Germany, did it??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would be too bad, since I am certain that somebody over here would<br/>&gt; like one or could use a &quot;backup.&quot;  A possibility, of course,  is to use<br/>&gt; two in &quot;tandem&quot; in a larger &quot;orchestra&quot; as Jacky Ligon has...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ______________ ____ __ __ __<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson<br/>&gt;</p></div>
