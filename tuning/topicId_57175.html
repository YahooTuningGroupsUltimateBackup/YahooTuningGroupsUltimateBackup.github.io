This might shed some light on<br/>the issue at hand.</p><p>My personal opinion is that Maqam Music is much MORE intricate than<br/>expressed by &grave;commatic differences&grave;. If you want to map a certain maqam to<br/>53-tET, I surmise it will only be a crude approximation of the real<br/>phenomenon. Yet, due to the &grave;pyhtagorean air&grave; and level of detail one can<br/>achieve with 53tET, the Middle East finds this temperament tolerable for the<br/>transcription of maqams.</p><p>If the Rast tetrachord were to be mapped to 53tET, the third note, or E<br/>quarter-flat on the staff, could be anywhere between (and around) 16th and<br/>17th degrees depending on the &quot;seyir&quot;, or &quot;melodic excursion&quot;. Let&apos;s see if<br/>your ears are in concord with me as to how these degrees should be applied<br/>to the Rast tetrachord.</p><p>In comparison with &quot;phoneme&quot;, &quot;perdes&quot; signify the entire set of pitches and<br/>pitch-clusters within about two and a half octaves according to historical<br/>treatises. The singular form is &quot;perde&quot;, which generally means &quot;pitch&quot;.<br/>Nevertheless, there are instances where a single &quot;perde&quot; can vary in<br/>pitch according to maqam and seyir.</p><p>Below is a list of perdes (and their solmization with ratios prepared by<br/>myself) given by Sheik Abdulbaki Nasr Dede of the early 19th century,<br/>Istanbul:</p><p>1.
