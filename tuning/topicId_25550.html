Done a few<br/>years ago</p><p>&quot;Bad Vibes!&quot;<br/>or<br/>&quot;Everybody&apos;s Heard About the Bird!&quot;<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>ENSEMBLE OF THE 31 BIRDS</p><p>In what way are you your parents&apos; child?</p><p> In the obvious &quot;pro and con&quot; ways.  My father was well known for his<br/>Psychic and visionary gifts.  He even had his own following.  His sights</p><p>were toward the future.  He sought to escape history.  My mother, on the</p><p>other hand, reminded me of my diverse ancestry, while not inclined to<br/>look forward.  Now I find, in the most ancient, a cue toward the future<br/>and vice-versa.</p><p> There is an assumption, in this question, that the key to a person lies</p><p>in the parents - kind of a behaviorist reduction.  Such belief were put<br/>to bed once I had a child and noticed that she had traits independent<br/>and opposite of both her mother and I.</p><p>What aspects of structure does your music share with your upbringing?</p><p> Abrupt changes mixed with stasis.</p><p>Are structure and control mutually inclusive?</p><p> Of course not!</p><p>Does structure become an aspect of the aesthetic itself when composing?</p><p> Of course so!</p><p>Is it possible to create a work of art existing independently of the<br/>aesthetic?</p><p> Who cares about Art?  Art in most cases is the secularization of Sacred</p><p>Objects.  I am interested in its opposite.</p><p>What does the term &quot;power electronics&quot; mean to you?</p><p> Loud, suppressive noise.  Fascism.  Power in the ability to humiliate<br/>and nothing more</p><p>Does that term refer to the power of electronics, the empowerer, or a<br/>third mind?</p><p> I&apos;m not qualified to answer</p><p>Insofar as your music goes, why do you do what you do?</p><p> I can&apos;t help it and sometimes it is quite self-entertaining!</p><p>Is chance as important as knowledge, in experimental music?</p><p> The greatness of (John) Cage is that he knew (had knowledge of) just<br/>what chance was!</p><p>Is it important, at times, not to know what you&apos;re doing in experimental</p><p>music?</p><p> Yes, it is good to remember that the part of us that creates is not<br/>always the part that analyses.</p><p>What is your ancestry?</p><p> I have 9 known nationalities, including Chippewa and Slavic</p><p>Was your heritage crucial in bringing you to where you are now with your</p><p>music?</p><p> Economically, yes.  The most successful new music people have outside<br/>support or sell pot to underwrite their &quot;profession&quot;.  Having a widely<br/>diverse background prevents my music from resolving to any cultural<br/>singularity!</p><p>Does your way of thinking about your music affect your life in general?</p><p> I find that sometimes I have a hard time functioning in everyday<br/>routines.  Sometimes I will start thinking about some music idea in a<br/>middle of a conversation.  It has nothing to do with the person, it&apos;s<br/>some form of subconscious overdrive.</p><p>Should art be consumptive?</p><p> It is something people do that sometimes others enjoy consuming.<br/>People do something they want to do out of some inner urge or drive.  No</p><p>one is bothered with making ART anymore except as an economic<br/>enterprise.</p><p>Are people who answer questions with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; stupid, or just plain</p><p>lazy?</p><p> That question is like Socrates, leading others along to where he wants<br/>to lead them!</p><p>Does experimental music imply a separation of art and artist?</p><p> I don&apos;t think there really is that much experimental music these days.<br/>The process is more of assimilation of the early revolt.  Today we pick<br/>up the pieces and unearth the gems!</p><p>How has your music separated you from living life?</p><p> Living is a music, and music is living but not a way to make a living,<br/>at least not at this point.  Besides, those who do, many times end up<br/>hating it.  Where is that?!</p><p>Does your music have an ending point?</p><p> No, none of my pieces end, they just become inaudible.</p><p>Do you see your work continued after you have assumed room temperature?</p><p> Only in a general way, not a specific way.  Each person has different<br/>questions they want to answer and explore.</p><p>Who do you see today carrying the tradition of experimental music into<br/>tomorrow?</p><p> There will always be the Dreamers that remain (as Harry pointed out!).</p><p>Does performing microtonal music make you live longer?</p><p> I many times experience different bodily reactions that I consider<br/>beneficial.  This is the opposite reaction I have to noise!  After all,<br/>most of the people who were doing music when I started have fallen to<br/>the wayside.  I&apos;m not about to stop!</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p><br/>
