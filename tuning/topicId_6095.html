I&apos;d also like<br/>to make MIDIs of the _5th Quartet_ (his first use of 36-ET)<br/>and _16th Quartet_ (his first use of 31-ET), if I can find<br/>the scores.</p><p>As usual, I&apos;ve edited the note-durations to precisely reflect<br/>the composer&apos;s phrasing markings, and made extensive use<br/>of _rubato_ in my tempos, to delineate the phrase-groupings<br/>and make the performance more expressive.</p><p>I&apos;d like to note that my version of these pieces seems to<br/>me to give Haba&apos;s melodies a great deal of the quality of<br/>speech, which I think is partly the result of the use of<br/>quarter-tone intervals.</p><p>The _2nd Quartet_, which (I think) was the last piece<br/>Haba wrote in Vienna, where he had been studying Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>compositions, sounds to me like it was heavily influenced by<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s _1st Quartet_, op 7.</p><p>Also evident when listening to both of these samples<br/>is how Haba&apos;s style changed after the Communist takeover<br/>of Czechoslovakia in 1947.  The _16th Quartet_ has a<br/>palpable folk-song feel to it that is very different<br/>from the style of the _2nd Quartet_.</p><p>I&apos;ve never heard these pieces before, so I&apos;m going strictly<br/>on my own deduction of what&apos;s in the score.</p><p>(The only performance of a Haba work I&apos;ve ever heard was<br/>Wim Hoogewerf playing his _2nd Suite for quarter-tone guitar_,<br/>op 63, at a recent AFMM concert.)</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
