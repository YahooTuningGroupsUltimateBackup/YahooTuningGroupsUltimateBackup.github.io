If I spoke to them about you it was about composition, not the<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; paper.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, actually I was responding more to something you yourself posted on<br/>&gt; Metatuning, in which you describe informing Mat, it seems, of  some sort of<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; intolerance on my part.<br/>&gt; <a href="/metatuning/topicId_2475.html#2475">/metatuning/topicId_2475.html#2475</a><br/>&gt; (Joe Pehrson and Paul Erlich had been saying repeatedly that Metatuning was<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; place to go with this dialogue, so I checked it out, though I didn&apos;t find<br/>&gt; much.) Joe<br/>&gt; Maneri knows my article inside-out, and Mat has had his own copy if it for<br/>&gt; a long<br/>&gt; time, though who knows if he&apos;s read it. He has known me and my approach for<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; years, so it&apos;s just the same. We can let this issue go, though, if you<br/>&gt; wish.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I wrote:  &quot;I told him of Julia&apos;s 72-tone bias and the division she<br/>is perceived to be drawing between JI and exotic tunings....and the further<br/>fracturing of 12 ET. He was glad to be told (as I said to him, so he<br/>wouldn&apos;t be blindsided). He knew nothing of this but told me squarely that<br/>he does not share this view.&quot;</p><p>Here I wrote of tongue-in-cheek of a 72 bias to the son of the major US<br/>proponent.<br/>Julia, you have not been clear.  Otherwise, there would not be a &quot;perception&quot;<br/>that you are intolerant.  I hope to speak with them soon (Christine and Mat).</p><p>&gt; &gt;And I think the usage by PNM is paramount to what is gained by you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure what you mean by this statement. The sum value of the PNM<br/>&gt; essay is<br/>&gt; nothing more than how it has served *me*?<br/>&gt;</p><p>You are serving PNM more than you may realize.  More on this for private<br/>communication.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Truly, I have avoided theory all my life as a career.  After 4<br/>&gt; postgraduate<br/>&gt; &gt; years at Columbia in ethnomusicology and theory, I was supposed to move<br/>&gt; &gt; exclusively to theory.  Ethno kicked me out, but theory was unsatisfying.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Composition and Performance are my favorites.  Theory took the gut joy<br/>&gt; out of<br/>&gt; &gt; playing.  Composing is independent of theory.  Besides, theories that are<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; based on style are ipso-facto biased.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I share these sentiments, more or less. My Ph.D. is actually in Composition<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; Theory, but I&apos;ve never had the heart of a theorist (which may be one reason<br/>&gt; I was<br/>&gt; never drawn to JI or other tuning fields).</p><p>Julia, I think it is mainly life experience.  You never were seduced by the<br/>beautiful sounds that are just.  As for my polymicrotonal material, I don&apos;t<br/>think you have heard any of it.  Nor an AFMM concert.  I&apos;m not sure you know<br/>much outside the University experience.</p><p>Theory for me is useless unless it can &gt; help us figure out how to compose our<br/>&gt; own music, or help us understand the music<br/>&gt; of others. In other words, I&apos;d say that theory  *is* about how music is<br/>&gt; composed,<br/>&gt; put together, and nothing more, for me.</p><p>This is fine with me.</p><p>&gt; There seems to be an impression that I am advising avoiding fifths, thirds,<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt; (12-note ET or &quot;almost-just&quot;). What I actually wrote in PNM (see page 189)<br/>&gt; about<br/>&gt; this was advice to try to de-emphasize *all* of the familiar, traditional<br/>&gt; intervals of<br/>&gt; 12-note ET. All of them. (Some of you guys ought to like that!) My exact<br/>&gt; words:<br/>&gt; &quot;A concerted effort to *avoid*  emphasis of the traditional intervals is<br/>&gt; based, of<br/>&gt; course, not on some presumed criteria regarding the quality of certain<br/>&gt; relationships [no &quot;synaesthesia&quot; here], but rather upon the need simply to<br/>&gt; experience the new relationships, to become familiar with them and give<br/>&gt; them<br/>&gt; musical relevance.&quot; Isn&apos;t that pretty benign?<br/>&gt;</p><p>The question that seems to be shaping up is whether to hear music in<br/>relationship to something that is being avoided, or listening to new<br/>intervals based on ridding old habits.  Doesn&apos;t the music give the new<br/>relationships relevance?  How did your paper improve upon that relevance?</p><p>&gt; I never would have stated that I, or Joe, or Mat - I didn&apos;t even discuss Mat<br/>&gt; in the<br/>&gt; essay - compose or play without &quot;low number superparticular,&quot; as you put<br/>&gt; it.<br/>&gt; (Octaves, fifths, thirds.) We just use different shades of them. A major<br/>&gt; third<br/>&gt; augmented by 33 cents, for example, has a delicious flavor, and so on. At<br/>&gt; the same time, the interrelatedness of different, even parallel, musical<br/>&gt; traditions isn&apos;t the same thing as their having the same demands. (Joe has<br/>&gt; never been much of a<br/>&gt; rocker, or a minimalist, by the way.) And under whose guidance do you think<br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; came to these ideas (like the ones I mention above on p189 of PNM)? Joe&apos;s,<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; course. He was my teacher for ten years!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Julia<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, I know you studied with Joe.  He&apos;s an old friend.  What I am responding<br/>to now is the perception that you are missing a perspective that your article<br/>is more PNM than it is AFMM.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=38541 href="#38541">ðŸ”—</a>jwerntz2002 &#x3C;juliawerntz@attbi.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2002 4:39:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Julia, you have not been clear.

The writing is dense, and unless<br/>one reads it carefully - and if one comes at it with strong preconceptions about<br/>what I *might* be saying - one can get the wrong impression, which has happened<br/>with a few of the Tuning List members, and has *not* happened with other<br/>members. I was aware, when writing, that I would not have the luxury of knowing<br/>that all readers would take my words at face value - the way they are intended. But<br/>I was unable to write any other way than clear and straight-forward. I did write a<br/>page or so to acknowledge the beautiful work of some composers, such as Ezra<br/>Sims, Ben Johnston, Manfred Stahnke, etc., and in that section stated my belief that<br/>it&apos;s possible to make good music with JI. But I judged that adding *further*<br/>paragraphs here and there to reassure the reader of my good intentions would<br/>have added unecessary bulk to an already wordy paper, though perhaps this was a<br/>misjudgement, after all.</p><p>&gt; Julia, I think it is mainly life experience.
