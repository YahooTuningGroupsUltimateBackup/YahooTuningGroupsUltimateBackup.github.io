The process of producing a<br/>scale of melodic integrity by the superposition of a single interval<br/>(generator). Those points where there is only 2 different size intervals<br/>are called MOMENTS OF SYMMETRY. This cycle has the property that any<br/>occurrence of an interval will always be subtended by the same number of<br/>steps. When a harmonic system is used instead of a single interval and<br/>all the melodic gaps are filled the scale is referred to as a CONSTANT<br/>STRUCTURE. It is also been found fruitful to utilized the Moments of<br/>Symmetry within a preexisting Moment of Symmetry.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=2470 href="#2470">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

If the<br/>interval between two pure tones is greater than a critical band, there will<br/>be no roughness in the sensation; as the interval is further decreased the<br/>roughness will at first increase, then the notes will sound like they are<br/>fusing into one rough sound; then the sensation will be of one tone of<br/>varying amplitute (beating); then the roughness will decrease as the rate of<br/>beating decreases, slowing down to zero as the interval approaches unison.</p><p>tonalness</p><p>A quantity measuring the sonance of an interval or chord, based on the<br/>degree to which the notes approximate a harmonic series over a single<br/>fundamental and thereby blend into a single sensation. The perceived pitch<br/>of that single sensation corresponds to the root of the chord. This<br/>conception of sonance is associated with the harmonic theories in the<br/>tradition of Rameau, and finds a modern advocate in Parncutt.</p><p>matrix: the representation of ratios in terms of the exponents of the prime<br/>factors is really a vector, not a matrix; vector addition is what you mean<br/>instead of matrix addition. A matrix is not a mathematical model so much as<br/>a mathematical construct, a generalization of the concept of number. Also,<br/>only prime factors, not odd factors, should be used in calculations with<br/>matrices; I noticed the same problem with the &quot;unison vector&quot; definition.<br/>Another problem in the latter: the 225/224 is not a septimal schisma (which<br/>is 33554432/33480783) but I think it&apos;s a kleisma.</p><p>determinant</p><p>A calculation made on a matrix. When the matrix is square and the rows<br/>represent independent unison vectors, the determinant indicates the number<br/>of pitches contained within the corresponding periodicity block. This was<br/>documented by Fokker.</p><p>Interestingly, the same numbers which delimit ETs with good rational<br/>implication often also specify the number of pitch-classes in<br/>just-intonation systems which incorporate bridging to delineate the finity<br/>of the system.</p></div>
