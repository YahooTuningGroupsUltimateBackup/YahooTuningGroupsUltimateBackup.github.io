Within<br/>this range, major and minor thirds are equally impure by 1/7 comma<br/>(~3.07 cents). The effect is for me very stately.</p><p>Secondly, the major thirds Bb-D and E-G# are within 10 cents of pure:<br/>as in any &quot;8-4&quot; temperament extraordinaire (eight regular meantone<br/>fifths, others equally wide), these thirds are precisely 300 cents<br/>smaller than the regular meantone fifth, or here about 395.81 cents<br/>(9.50 cents wide). They are almost as good, with respect to 4:5<br/>(~386.31 cents), as in 1/7-comma meantone (~395.53 cents, ~9.22 cents<br/>wide). This can be especially helpful in E Phrygian, where sonorities<br/>with a major third (E-G#-B) are often used at closes.</p><p>Thirdly, all five of the remaining major thirds are _larger_ than<br/>Pythagorean, the &quot;squirrel&quot; factor so pleasing for neo-medieval styles<br/>in this part of the circle, and also for some 16th-century music<br/>calling for diminished fourths. For example, I find the diminished<br/>fourth G#-C (~420.95 cents) very pleasing for a Spanish piece<br/>audaciously using the sonority E-G#-C in approaching the final cadence<br/>on E.</p><p>Also, the 7-limit approximations at the farthest side of the circle<br/>are almost as good as in 22-EDO: for example, Eb-Bb-Db-F (or, in a<br/>conventional meantone spelling, Eb-Bb-C#-F) gives ~0-708-983-1417<br/>cents as an approximation of 4:6:7:9 (~0-709-982-1418 in 22-EDO).</p><p>Of course, a temperament extraordinaire with even more heavily<br/>tempered meantone fifths (as with Wilson&apos;s metameantone) would yield<br/>even better results for Bb-D and E-G# with respect to 4:5, and even<br/>better 7-limit approximations (including a virtually pure 7:9, as has<br/>been observed). However, one could argue that the extra tempering<br/>would compromise the quality of the usual meantone sonorities; Lindley<br/>suggests that around 2/7-comma is the upper end of the optimal range<br/>(although one might choose 1/3-comma or 19-EDO for a regular 19-note<br/>circulating system, for example).</p><p>As long as conventional Renaissance music stays in the range of Bb-G#,<br/>apart from sonorities such as diminished fourths (e.g. C#-F or G#-C),<br/>the system is pretty much interchangeable with a regular 2/7-comma<br/>meantone, with all usually spelled major thirds staying within 10<br/>cents of 4:5.</p><p>The obvious weak point is Eb-G, with a third slightly larger than<br/>Pythagorean (~408.38 cents) hardly interchangeable with the intended<br/>meantone size in a Renaissance setting. However, many 16th-century<br/>pieces stay within a Bb-G# range, or can be transposed with such a<br/>range. For a neo-medieval style, of course, Eb-G is a fine resource.</p><p>Anyway, thanks to Gene Ward Smith and Bob Wendell for the dialogue<br/>which led me to experiment with the temperament extraordinaire<br/>approach; and also to Paul Erlich for his 22-EDO and paultone<br/>discussions, some of which seem curiously relevant to a system of this<br/>type.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
