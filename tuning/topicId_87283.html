However I&apos;ve figure out enough to be sure that you can&apos;t take either the critical-band-consonance theory or JI theory alone and solve nearly all tuning/consonance-related problems.  It&apos;s great we have people around with your attitude though IE more dedicated to solving the problems at hand than showing that they know a lot or taking too much ego in their work.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I played the 33/16 interval using<br/>a piano voice and it clearly sounded &quot;jarring&quot;. With a sine lead voice<br/>however the beating was obvious but (to my ear and my ear has fooled me<br/>before) not too unpleasant.&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;but just out of curiosity I played a 47/19 interval and again, with a<br/>piano voice it didn&apos;t sound great but with the sine lead voice it<br/>sounded beautiful.&quot;<br/>   it would be nice if I had a second person on here verify (or &quot;de-verify&quot;?) this, but I&apos;m guessing in the 47/19 piano case a low overtone of the first tone on the piano is clashing with the first root or first overtone of the second (higher) base tone.<br/>   This type of overtone/root clashing I&apos;ve found is generally the only thing that can make an interval played with a sine wave sound better than with a full instruments.  This goes hand-in-hand with the criticism given before of (paraphrased) &quot;a weakness is your theory&apos;s not take timbre into account&quot;.</p><p>      Also to note...aligning overtones to match root tones (IE making the timbre and scale match and change for each different root tone) and using Sethares-style timbres are the two ways to make &quot;instruments act like sine waves&quot; and achieve sine-wave like consonance.<br/>    Both of these (of course) involve electronic processing/manipulation of sound, though, so it is a bit of a barrier for non-electronic music (unless there was a guitar-pedal or &quot;real-time rack processor&quot; designed to perform the processing in real-time...really wish there was). ;-)</p><p>   One thing though...I actually think &quot;just optimizing for sines&quot; is not a bad idea because if you start optimizing for all possible overtones you are very likely to just run straight into JI diatonic (as so many theorists, including Sethares, have).</p><p>&gt;&quot;I need to look into this but I haven&apos;t ruled out my formulas just yet.<br/>Perhaps they are correct with pure sine wave tones only (no overtones).&quot;</p><p>   I think, at least with fairly low prime limit ratios your formula should work pretty well...but I&apos;m pretty sure temperaments with high-limit fractions fairly near low-limit ones will confuse it (due to things like the &quot;so close to the octave&quot; mis-match you ran into).<br/>    The thing I believe you formula would ultimately need (even with regards to &quot;just&quot; sine wave) is some way to start exponentially (and seperately) subtracting the critical-band and JI/&quot;periodicity&quot; types of consonance past a certain point.  For example, for you numbers around 6/5 might be one &quot;limit&quot; on periodic consonance while around 1.09 might be one for &quot;critical band consonance&quot;.<br/>    Another plus I figure would be to assume that two notes in a scale very close to each other need to be more periodic than those, say, two notes much further apart because the first two are fighting against more critical band dissonance and need less periodic dissonance in order to compensate for this (here things like super-particular ratios, of course, come in handy).</p><p>&gt;&quot;47/19 is very &quot;non periodic&quot; yet sounds beautiful (using a sine lead voice) so perhaps you can&apos;t be &quot;too non periodic&quot;.&quot;<br/>   Well, come to think of it, 47/19 = 2.47, which is VERY close to 2.5 (AKA 5/2) which is very periodic.  Same issue as you ran into with the being too close to the 2/1 (octave) before, only instead you&apos;re too close the to the &quot;octave plus the major third&quot;.  Here it seems temperament again appears to comes into play.</p><p>    The only conclusion I&apos;m about 99% sure of is you only have a certain amount of slack to far as periodicity and critical band...and if you either grossly violate one of these limitations or start pushing one without giving a corresponding amount of lack on the other you run into trouble.</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
