My<br/>recommendation was not to avoid these hugely important works, but<br/>rather to read them with an awareness that they present only one side<br/>of the coin (albeit the more popular side). Of course to suggest<br/>sound exists &quot;outside the body&quot; is speculative, but to suggest that<br/>it _doesn&apos;t_ exist &quot;outside the body&quot; is _just_ as speculative. And<br/>it is to this type of &apos;implicit speculation&apos; I wished to alert the<br/>new reader.</p><p>&apos;Implicit speculation&apos; is a much graver beast than anything openly<br/>speculative. Just because the &apos;speculations&apos; of the books in question<br/>tend to hide behind demonstrable and &apos;verifiable&apos; data does not make<br/>them &apos;immune&apos; to questioning. The Partch-Helmholtz view seems to me<br/>to be a firmly closed book, closed to the possibility of there being<br/>anything beyond the &apos;verifiable&apos;. (Sure, sound &apos;verifiably&apos; has a<br/>corporeal consequence, but does that automatically mean its first<br/>principle is corporeal?)</p><p>I think it was Paul who made the point that reading should be about<br/>exposing oneself to as many &quot;ideological biases&quot; as possible, and I<br/>now agree that this is probably a more sensible tactic than trying to<br/>seek the perfect &apos;neutral&apos; book. Thus, I make yet another suggestion<br/>to Alex (the new reader), and that is to read Partch and Helmholtz,<br/>but to also read the following:</p><p>Duckworth, William, et al., ed. _Sound and Light: La Monte Young<br/>Marian Zazeela_.

I discovered Helmholtz / Ellis (Ellis was as much a part of<br/>this as Helmholtz was) in the late 1960s / early 1970s and<br/>immediately went out and tried stuff using digital circuitry and<br/>computers. I had been exposed to Partch by that time, but didn&apos;t know<br/>then that his theories were built around JI.

In any<br/>event, along with Helmholtz and Partch, I would add<br/>Sethares&apos; &quot;Tuning, Timber, Spectrum, Scale&quot; as essential reading!<br/>Sethares, along with Wendy Carlos, Easley Blackwood and a few other<br/>pioneers, took what Helmholtz and Partch did with JI and expanded it<br/>to other forms of microtonality and xentonality. *My* bias here, as<br/>is well known, is to electronic / computer implementations of music<br/>in general and microtonality in particular, so it shouldn&apos;t come as<br/>any great surprise that Sethares, Carlos and Blackwood are on my<br/>essential reading / listening list.</p><p>Which brings up an interesting point ... shouldn&apos;t we also be<br/>discussing an essential *listening* list?<br/>--<br/>Relax!
