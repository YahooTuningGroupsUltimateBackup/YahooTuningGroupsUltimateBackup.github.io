It will also make changes very hard, imagine having to<br/>change channels if you add notes later. Fortunately the command<br/>EXAMPLE/MIDI in Scala can take care of this. It will leave the track<br/>ordering intact and put all the pitch bend messages in a single extra<br/>track. You need to make a mapping between note numbers and scale<br/>degrees and use this entering your score in Finale. Remember you<br/>can&apos;t have more than 128 pitches. For example if you use a 36-note<br/>scale you have at most 128/36 octaves if you use all of them.<br/>You could also make a mapping for all 128 midi notes separately<br/>instead of using octave repetition.<br/>In Scala you LOAD the scale you wish to use, then LOAD/MAP the<br/>mapping you created, then transform the midi file with EXAMPLE/MIDI.<br/>You can also leaves midi channels untouched with the SET EXCLUDE<br/>command. Look in the help file for how to do everything.<br/>I&apos;m out of town now, if you need help I probably won&apos;t respond soon.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=26012 href="#26012">ðŸ”—</a>JoJoBuBu@aol.com</h3><span>7/4/2001 10:55:09 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 7/4/2001 7:53:49 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com">manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I hear that midi pitch bend units depend on hardware.

I made an example<br/>once like this and it worked fine I just didn&apos;t know what the values meant.<br/>In other words I&apos;d like to enter accidentals into the score and have them<br/>play it back rather than just making midi files.
