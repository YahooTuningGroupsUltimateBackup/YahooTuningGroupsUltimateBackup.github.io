Thanks for the article, it gives<br/>all the info you&apos;d need! Looks like it transmits each string on it&apos;s own<br/>channel, so it&apos;s ready for microtonality. And apparently supports an<br/>expression pedal, cool. It actually maps the accelerometer to midi--cool!</p><p>It also looks like the Strat has pitch to midi built in? That&apos;ll be cool to<br/>keep costs down. I wonder how well it works for real music making.<br/>On Mon, Nov 1, 2010 at 1:47 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt;wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This might be a neat, cheap tool to use for MIDI guitar retuning.

The good news is that the strings are velocity sensitive. One drawback is that hammer-ons and pull-offs aren&apos;t supported, so you have to strum each note. There&apos;s a &quot;synth mode&quot; which just transmits button presses, but you need to actually strum to set the velocity, which doesn&apos;t work all that well.</p><p>However, if you look at the MIDI data it sends, each button press generates a SysEx message. So it shouldn&apos;t be too hard to write a program that reads the button presses from the SysEx data and the strumming from the note on messages, and then you can do whatever you want with the data. Does anyone have any pointers on writing MIDI software?</p><p>Now all I have to do is actually learn how to play the thing. I can barely manage the &quot;warmup&quot; songs (the easiest ones in the game) on hard difficulty on pro bass (which is easier than the pro guitar parts).</p></div><h3><a id=95070 href="#95070">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2010 8:01:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; However, if you look at the MIDI data it sends, each<br/>&gt; button press generates a SysEx message.
