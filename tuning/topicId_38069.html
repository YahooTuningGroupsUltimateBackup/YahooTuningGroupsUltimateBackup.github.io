From another view, this is the<br/>special case of two 12-note chains which happen to be placed precisely<br/>a Pythagorean comma apart (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents). A slight<br/>modification of this scheme increases the distance between the manuals<br/>to a 64:63 (~27.26 cents), or by about 3.80 cents, producing pure<br/>ratios of 2-3-7-9.</p><p>A conceptually elegant feature of these two solutions is that we have<br/>a regular or virtually regular system with free transposibility within<br/>the range of the 24-note gamut. However, schemes with other distances<br/>between the keyboards can have the advantage of making available other<br/>types of intervals, or ratios of 2-3-7-9 in more positions.</p><p>Curiously, while such a Pythagorean-based system is, of course,<br/>distinguished by its pure tuning of fourths and fifths, the primary<br/>consonances in a neo-medieval setting, it can sometimes involve<br/>delicate compromises regarding other types of stylistically favored<br/>intervals.</p><p>For example, the Pythagorean tricomma tuning places the two keyboards<br/>at a distance of three Pythagorean commas (each at 531441:524288, or<br/>about 23.46 cents), or around 70.38 cents, emulating as it were<br/>24-of-36-tET as a system combining approximate ratios of 2-3-7-9 and<br/>14:17:21. A very notable difference is that the just system is much<br/>less accurate for such ratios as 9:7, 7:6, and 7:4 -- as well as<br/>making these ratios available in fewer positions!</p><p>While 36-tET might be considered a special kind of neo-medieval<br/>&quot;near-just&quot; tuning -- and an excellent one -- such systems more<br/>typically have the fifths tempered by about the same amount, but in<br/>the opposite direction.</p><p>As with the Pythagorean-based just systems, a near-just system may<br/>consist either of a simple 24-note regular tuning with a single chain<br/>of fifths; or of two 12-note chains of fifths at some convenient<br/>distance other than that of the enharmonic diesis (e.g. G#-Ab, the<br/>amount which the chromatic semitone exceeds the diatonic semitone).</p><p>The usual parameters are about like this:</p><p>      (1) The fifths are gently tempered in the wide direction<br/>          by about 1.5-2.65 cents;</p><p>      (2) Regular major and minor thirds are around 14:11<br/>          and 13:11 or 33:28 (~284.45 cents);</p><p>      (3) Augmented seconds and diminished fourths are not too<br/>          far from 17:14 (~336.13 cents) and 21:17 (~365.83 cents);</p><p>      (4) There are often rather close approximations of ratios<br/>          of 2-3-7-9, with most of these intervals within 3 cents<br/>          or so of pure; and</p><p>      (5) Other attractions can include sonorities involving narrow<br/>          fourths around 21:16 (~470.71 cents) or &quot;superfourths&quot;<br/>          around 11:8 (~551.32 cents); assorted neutral intervals<br/>          around ratios such as 11:9 (~347.41 cents) and 11:6<br/>          (~1049.36 cents); and so on.</p><p>While dialogues about the amount of temperament permitted or desirable<br/>in a &quot;near-just&quot; system might focus on topics such as beat rates of<br/>fifths, my range of around 1.5-2.65 cents could be taken as reflecting<br/>certain pragmatic structural factors.</p><p>The lower amount of around 1.5 cents, as in 29-tET (fifths ~703.45<br/>cents, ~1.49 cents wide), is about the minimum required to move<br/>augmented seconds and diminished fourths within, say, 5 or 6 cents<br/>of 14:17:21. Having some of these intervals available as part of a<br/>regular 12-note chain helps in optimizing for item (3) above.</p><p>If we seek _all_ of the above optimization criteria in a regular<br/>24-note tuning _with a single chain of fifths_, then the upper amount<br/>of around 2.65 cents (fifths ~704.61 cents) provides ratios of 2-3-7-9<br/>arguably approaching &quot;near-just&quot; accuracy, along with augmented<br/>seconds and diminished fourths (around 341.46 cents and 363.14 cents)<br/>still with a quality somewhat like that of 14:17:21, although leaning<br/>somewhat toward the more central neutral region.</p><p>As it happens, 2.65 cents is close to the 2.7 cents or so which Dave<br/>Keenan has mentioned as one possible maximum for a &quot;near-just&quot; tuning,<br/>about that of 1/4-(syntonic)-comma meantone where fifths are impure by<br/>around 5.38 cents in the opposite direction.</p><p>Here I should add that George Secor has proposed an approach to<br/>&quot;near-just&quot; systems where fifths are considerably closer to pure, say<br/>within about 1.625 cents -- or, from another viewpoint, where the<br/>ratios 9:8 and 16:9 are impure by not more than twice this amount,<br/>about 3.25 cents.</p><p>Given the attractions of such Gothic and neo-medieval sonorities as<br/>6:8:9 and 4:6:9, Secor&apos;s point is a very cogent one as applied to the<br/>systems we are now considering.</p><p>One response to these definitions might be to recognize various<br/>degrees of &quot;near-justness,&quot; with each proposed definition educating us<br/>as to some of the compromises in an often fine balancing process.</p><p>To conclude, I might remark that the distinct attractions of just and<br/>near-just systems of a similar kind can involve considerations other<br/>than simple issues of &quot;purity.&quot;</p><p>For example, one of the attractions of 36-tET for me is that it&apos;s a<br/>bit of a &quot;change of pace&quot; -- having regular minor thirds and<br/>diminished fourths the same size is a bit different. This 20th-century<br/>kind of symmetry makes possible approximations of 2-3-7-9 and 14:17:21<br/>in more positions -- and both Busoni&apos;s &quot;tripartite tone&quot; at 66.67<br/>cents, and the 2/3-tone at 133.33 cents, are beautiful melodic<br/>intervals.</p><p>With the Pythagorean tricomma tuning -- a kind of JI &quot;emulation -- a<br/>main attraction is having a 36-tET-like scheme with regular<br/>Pythagorean intervals such as more expansive major thirds and compact<br/>diatonic semitones. There&apos;s also the elegance of a system using all<br/>&quot;native&quot; Pythagorean intervals -- the familiar medieval ones on each<br/>keyboard, plus the novel ones to be found by mixing or moving between<br/>notes on the two keyboards. Melodic steps at 70.38 cents (the tricomma<br/>between the keyboards) and 133.53 cents, used in the same types of<br/>progressions as their 36-tET counterparts, suggest the affinity of the<br/>two systems.</p><p>Both systems, interestingly, start with a standard 12-note historical<br/>tuning, and add another identical 12-note chain at some convenient<br/>distance to generate new types of steps and sonorities.</p><p>Here I&apos;d like to suggest that terms such as &quot;just&quot; and &quot;near-just&quot;<br/>take shape in a range of stylistic settings, with the kind of<br/>&quot;optimization&quot; sought in either approach -- or the very definitions of<br/>these approaches -- varying along with musical preferences.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
