An introductory paper (from the<br/>&gt; Proceedings of the First Annual Symposium for Systems Research and<br/>&gt; Cybernetics in the Arts, Baden-Baden, 1999) is available here in MS Word<br/>&gt; and plain text formats.  The entire dissertation is available for<br/>&gt; download here in Postscript (2.9Mb) and PDF (1.7 Mb) (viewable with<br/>&gt; Adobe Acrobat Reader) formats, as well as two browsable versions (with<br/>&gt; less than optimal handling of figures, equations, footnotes, etc.) here<br/>&gt; and here. The old site at Cardiff is available here, including the &quot;What<br/>&gt; is Rusty&quot; page and pictures of the old demo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The above materials describe the plan for the language in great<br/>&gt; detail. It now remains to code it but, as resources have been extremely<br/>&gt; meager, little progress has been made. This page will serve as the<br/>&gt; progress report, updated as progress occurs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; August 28, 2000---The first classes which must be coded are those which<br/>&gt; represent mathematical objects on which most musical objects depend.<br/>&gt; Principally these are one-dimensional functions. The class structure of<br/>&gt; this section has been altered somewhat from that described in the<br/>&gt; thesis, but it&apos;s still based on analytical combinations of complex<br/>&gt; functions represented as piecewise near-minimax polynomials on a<br/>&gt; partitioned domain.  The interfaces DomainValued and Evaluable are<br/>&gt; complete as are the classes Domain and Subdomain. The class NearMinimax,<br/>&gt; which represents a near minimax polynomials and calculates the expanded<br/>&gt; Chebychev points, is very nearly complete. A survey of possible Rusty<br/>&gt; generators (a &quot;Map of Parnassus&quot;) is underway, and may soon have its own<br/>&gt; webpage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; May 4, 2001---I have provided online versions of the thesis and the<br/>&gt; Baden-Baden paper in various formats. Work on the mathematical<br/>&gt; foundations continues slowly; I&apos;m currently reviewing methods for<br/>&gt; regression (least-squares using optimal or given basis polynomials or<br/>&gt; trigonametric polynomials), various types of piecewise interpolation<br/>&gt; (splines, etc., as a method of function definition), etc.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand a lot of that, but that&apos;s as it should be... ;-)</p><p>[] John T.
