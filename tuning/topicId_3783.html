However I<br/>really do like your generalized EDI proposal (and specifically the idea of<br/>a more generalized - and more specific - microtonal nomenclature). Here are<br/>a couple of off-the-cuff thoughts and comments -- I think that perhaps both<br/>the &quot;D&quot; and the &quot;I&quot; of the EDI may be unnecessary, as I think a designation<br/>on the order of say: &quot;n&quot;e, could (as much by default as anything else....)<br/>always be understood to say: &quot;The 2:1 equally divided by n...&quot; and then<br/>your other examples could perhaps be pared down to something on the order<br/>of say:</p><p>12e<br/>19e-3 (or 19e-3:1)<br/>7e-3:2<br/>31e-pi<br/>e-88c</p><p>Dan</p></div>
