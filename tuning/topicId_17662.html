I didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; mean to imply in any way that jazz stopped evolving at any<br/>&gt; point.  I was referring specifically to the extent of use of<br/>&gt; microtonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know that the biggest criticisms in the reviews of the<br/>&gt; &quot;Jazz&quot; PBS series are:  1) the fact that the movie is presented<br/>&gt; more-or-less as factual when in reality it is seen mostly thru<br/>&gt; Wynton Marsalis&apos;s own perspective, and  2) the way the last<br/>&gt; several decades are presented in much more perfunctory fashion<br/>&gt; than the earlier periods.</p><p>I&apos;ll get to the microtonal stuff in a min, but here&apos;s some thoughts.</p><p>It shouldn&apos;t have been a film, it should be a TV series on PBS<br/>called Jazz Biography. After a year or two or three, they would<br/>get to the lesser known jazz greats and everyone wouldn&apos;t feel slighted.<br/>But if documentries have to be made, someone other than Burns should<br/>make</p><p>Jazz II -  Free Jazz: the musicans that Sun Ra, Ornette Coleman, late<br/>           period John Coltrane and Cecil Taylor influenced. Maybe<br/>           the likes of Anthony Braxton, ACMM, the whole &quot;Downtown&quot;<br/>           scene of NYC jazz and free improv could fit in here. Also<br/>           the European influence, ie Evan Parker, Derek Bailey...</p><p>Jazz III - Fusion: from Larry Coryell to Miles Davis and his sidemen<br/>           who became band leaders - John McLaughlin, Chick Corea,<br/>           Herbie Handcock, and Joe Zawinul, through the &quot;Canterbury&quot;<br/>           English scene including Soft Machine, Alan Holdsworth and<br/>           Bill Bruford to its decline as CD-101 Smooth Jazz with the<br/>           likes of Kenny G. Somewhere in here Pat Metheny and John<br/>           Scofield could somehow fit in.</p><p>Jazz IV -  Straight Ahead - All those guys who continue to mine the<br/>           traditional territory of standards and the dense harmonic<br/>           vocabulary of chord subs.</p><p>&gt; But what I was saying here is that after the advent of bebop<br/>&gt; in the late 1940s, the increasingly sophisticated harmonic<br/>&gt; and melodic gestures simultaneously became increasingly<br/>&gt; grounded in 12-tET tuning (with glaring exceptions, of course),<br/>&gt; whereas from the beginning (c. 1915 or so) until that time,<br/>&gt; microtonality played a much larger role.</p><p>That&apos;s why I suggested Ornette Coleman (critics complained<br/>about his intonation!). His free jazz broke away<br/>from the harmonic prison of hard bop just like the modality of<br/>Miles Kind of Blue did. Both of these new directions opened up the<br/>music for any kind of microtonality.</p><p>In fact I can think of an old Pharoah Sanders album on Impulse<br/>where Cecil McBee (bass) is playing a harmonic 7th in his vamp.<br/>And hitting it constantly.</p><p>And then there&apos;s Eric Dolphy, Ron Carter, Sun Ra, Don Ellis<br/>from the &apos;60s.</p><p>And even during the &apos;50s hard bop period, horn players were sliding<br/>around a bit.</p><p>&gt; One thing I&apos;ve noticed in particular is how Louis Armstrong<br/>&gt; (the greatest jazz musician ever? possibly...)</p><p>I don&apos;t know about that - music ain&apos;t sports.</p><p>&gt; made very<br/>&gt; extensive use of microtonality in both his playing and singing<br/>&gt; in the early days, but as time went on, he conformed more<br/>&gt; and more to 12-tET.  Check it out.</p><p>Someday...now-a-days I&apos;m too busy with my own music and I want<br/>to go back to doing regular reviews for Juxtaposition Ezine on<br/>a regular basis.</p><p>db</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=17681 href="#17681">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2001 5:50:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, David Beardsley &lt;xouoxno@v...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17662">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/17662</a></p><p>&gt; It shouldn&apos;t have been a film, it should be a TV series on PBS<br/>&gt; called Jazz Biography.

Absolutely<br/>no way I can find the time right now... but if you listen to<br/>a fair selection of his recordings in chronological order,<br/>I guarantee you&apos;ll hear the shift.  The early stuff is *very*<br/>microtonal, while later big hits like &quot;Hello Dolly&quot; and &quot;What<br/>a Wonderful World&quot; are much less so.</p><p>(I haven&apos;t analyzed those, and maybe they&apos;re actually closer<br/>to JI than ET, but in any case, the melodic language is much<br/>more &quot;straightforward&quot; and simple than in the older tunes.<br/>In practically every Armstrong vocal or solo from the 1920s,<br/>there&apos;s at least one powerfully emphasized note - and usually<br/>many more - that&apos;s so microtonal it hits you in the face, and<br/>he eventually stopped doing this.)</p><p>And I realize that &quot;music ain&apos;t sports&quot; - that&apos;s why I put<br/>that comment in parentheses, but it does express my personal<br/>feeling... maybe.  I&apos;m also a huge fan of Benny Goodman and<br/>Coltrane... and Coleman, too.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div><h3><a id=17735 href="#17735">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2001 6:21:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; And then there&apos;s Eric Dolphy, Ron Carter, Sun Ra, Don Ellis<br/>&gt; &gt; from the &apos;60s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yep - more good exceptions.
