From what<br/>I&apos;ve been able to deduce from the Harmonic Entropy threads, the width<br/>of this is different for each interval, with the gravitational pull of<br/>the 3/2 being the most strong. So am I correct to assume that there is<br/>a sort of gradient scale of tonal gravity for each interval in terms<br/>of where it falls in integer size? If true, then the harmonic series<br/>would provide the order of gravitational pull: 1/1, 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 5/1<br/>etc...right - wrong?</p><p>Hi Jacky,</p><p>Though Paul will certainly be the one most apt to address this most<br/>clearly (as it&apos;s his baby), I would just like to say that if you look<br/>at something like Helmholtz&apos; intensity of influence chart, you can see<br/>something very much like an octave reduced n*d (numerator times<br/>denominator) ranking; as he gives a 9-odd limit (&quot;partials are given<br/>up to the 9th inclusive&quot; p. 187) example of:</p><p>1/1 2/1 3/2 4/3 5/3 5/4 7/4 6/5 7/5 8/5 7/6 9/5 8/7 9/7 9/8</p><p>However, if you look at the depth of the troughs, or local minima in<br/>Paul&apos;s various harmonic entropy graphs, you can see that they all<br/>differ depending slightly on the input of N, and more so on the type<br/>of series used, i.e., &quot;s&quot;; for instance, note the distinct differences<br/>in trough depth between the Farey and the Mann series in these<br/>examples:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/entropy.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/entropy.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>If I&apos;m reading this all correctly, then I would think that Paul would<br/>argue that it&apos;s the consistent occurrences of minima across the two<br/>variables of N (given that you start with a high enough N in the first<br/>place) and s that are most pertinent, rather than something like a<br/>cleanly ordered trough depth... but I&apos;ll digress and leave the cleanup<br/>job to Paul!</p><p>&gt; if I map a 13/10 to &quot;F&quot;, which I must do if I want to tune it to 454<br/>cents - well I certainly don&apos;t hear this interval as a 4/3 - I hear it<br/>as a very wide major 3rd.</p><p>Interesting, I actually tend to hear this more as some flavor of a<br/>fourth... maybe an interesting listening experiment would be to take a<br/>slate of some of Paul&apos;s various local dyadic maxima and have folks<br/>offer there opinion of what those intervals most resemble -- maybe a<br/>future project for Dr. Pehrson&apos;s Tuning Lab?</p><p>On a somewhat related note, I remember an old chart from Carl<br/>Seashore&apos;s &quot;Psychology of Music&quot; that gives an &quot;order of merit of<br/>interval in the consonance-dissonance series&quot; based on a empirical<br/>listening classification method that combined three criteria: S, P,<br/>and B -- smoothness, purity, and blending (see pp. 131 - 33 for more<br/>details):</p><p>C&apos;C&apos;&apos;<br/>C&apos;G&apos; (the chart actually says c&apos;g&apos;&apos; here, but I can only imagine that<br/>that must be a typo...)<br/>C&apos;A&apos;<br/>C&apos;E&apos;<br/>C&apos;F&apos;<br/>C&apos;Ab&apos;<br/>C&apos;Eb&apos;<br/>C&apos;Gb&apos;<br/>C&apos;Bb&apos;<br/>C&apos;D&apos;<br/>C&apos;B&apos;<br/>C&apos;Db&apos;</p><p>Hmm... Interestingly Seashore summarizes that, &quot;The significance of<br/>the above experiments lies not so much in the determination of<br/>consonance-dissonance as in showing what the contributing factors are.<br/>In general, we may say that consonance-dissonance depends primarily<br/>upon two factors; namely, roughness-smoothness and purity-richness.<br/>The factor of blending covers both of these and does not seem to add<br/>any new element, but merely represents a point of view in the<br/>judgement.&quot;</p><p>Dan</p></div>
