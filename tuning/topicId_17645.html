As I was watching tonight (pt. 5), which<br/>featured Benny Goodman, I couldn&apos;t help but note that Goodman was also<br/>quite involved with other types of music as well, having had a piece<br/>commissioned for Bartok to compose (Contrasts) for clarinet, violin, and<br/>piano. I believe this piece had a section for violin tuned 1/4 tone<br/>higher...am I right, or was it another composition? It&apos;s a cool<br/>piece...and it&apos;s always been interesting, to me, how Goodman kept his<br/>swing side and his &quot;modern&quot; side totally separate...I don&apos;t hear any<br/>attempt at trying to combine Bartok with his dance thing...would surely<br/>have been interesting if he had, somehow, and it probably would have<br/>cost him his audience...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=17657 href="#17657">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2001 3:15:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just a quick thought here....
