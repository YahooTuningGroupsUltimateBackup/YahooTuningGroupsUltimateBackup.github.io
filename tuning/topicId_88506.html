This song was written in the following scale, hand-crafted by Michael to be as sour and difficult as possible (it was originally non-octave, but I discovered this actually ADDED consonances, making the scale less of a challenge):</p><p>0&cent;<br/>149&cent;<br/>336&cent;<br/>471&cent;<br/>613&cent;<br/>763&cent;<br/>947&cent;<br/>1200&cent;</p><p>I think that one listen to this song will prove that while this scale would be useless in a common-practice setting, it is still capable of sounding pretty, expressive, nuanced, and gosh-darn accessible.  I used a grand piano sound layered with a filtered saw-tooth sound for the main instrument, so you can rest assured there are no &quot;tricks&quot; going on here to hide the dissonance.  I also put very little thought into the composition; by and large, it&apos;s all played by ear.  I didn&apos;t sit down and calculate where the &quot;good&quot; chords pop up, I just let the scale speak to me (and I am UTTERLY incompetent when it comes to playing the piano!  I probably have the worst keyboard technique of anyone on this list).  I think the litmus test for any scale is how easy it is to improvise with, as careful calculation can often hide the weaknesses of a scale.  This scale wasn&apos;t very hard at all.</p><p>My conclusion is that this scale really ain&apos;t that dissonant, despite utterly lacking a fifth (though there is a 724&cent; interval on the fourth degree, a 729&cent; interval on the seventh, and a 736&cent; interval on the fifth, every other degree misses the fifth by at least 60&cent;).   It has a piquant latin-jazz feel about it that I quite like.</p><p>As a companion piece, I&apos;d like to try something in the &quot;best&quot; scale Michael can come up with, sort of a &quot;Yin&quot; to the &quot;Yang&quot; of this track...whenever Michael gets that scale nailed down! ;-&gt;</p><p>Anyone else want to submit an &quot;impossible&quot; scale in which I can try to write a song in a popular idiom?  Let&apos;s keep it octave-based to ensure that I don&apos;t end up gaining extra consonances in different registers.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2010 12:16:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igliashon,</p><p>   Bizarre...it still sounds way off to me in some ways: beats are everywhere and nearly everything sounds &quot;jumpy&quot; and skewed...but much much less so than I would have thought and close enough that it comes across as confident.  It sounds almost like who is playing it both &quot;can&apos;t stay in a key&quot; but &quot;is somehow playing in another type of intelligent pattern&quot;...an oddly similar effect to what I got from my PHI and Silver Ratio-based scales when I heard what Chris made with them.<br/>  Seriously, I&apos;ve seen several pieces composed in things like &quot;5-limit JI&quot; that sound more off (far as overall mood generated by the piece) than this (good job!). ;-)</p><p>   Granted, the piano (which I hear loudly over the sawtooth) has a relatively in-harmonic timbre and may have given you a bit of extra leeway.  Also the chords and it seems notes are hit one by one and/or as dyads at most and then &quot;droned&quot; at a much lower volume to create larger chords (also comes across to me as a slight cheat).</p><p>   Dare I ask...can you re-generate this piece using a trumpet (very dense harmonic/overtone set) as the main instrument?  I think it would reveal the sourness in some of the chords in more detail.  Though even if it did/does...I think you succeeded by-and-large on &quot;defeating&quot; this scale and indirectly proving &quot;over-doing dissonance can actually flip back around and lead to some consonance&quot;..</p><p>---------------<br/>  And far as the &quot;sweetest scale&quot;....I&apos;m still working on it.  I have a version I&apos;m fairly sure has all notes within about 7-8 cents of their ideal values.  I&apos;m just going to have to convert it to cents because it&apos;s &quot;just&quot; a highly tempered version of</p><p>12/11<br/>5/4<br/>11/8<br/>3/2<br/>5/3<br/>11/6<br/>2/1<br/>............with the actual notes being up to about 7-9 cents away from the above values to preserve a fairly relaxed sounding &quot;circle of imitation fifths&quot; which rotate between 7/5, 22/15, 3/2, and 8/5 (and maybe 50/33 as well)...which I calculated as some of the more consonant intervals in the 7/5 to 8/5 range.  I also avoided the nasty 16/11 &quot;Wolf&quot; 5th-like interval that keeps popping up in Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scale by doing this.</p><p>       I obviously couldn&apos;t just use a fairly pure circle of fifths or fairly pure any-other-interval...because if I did I would have no way to hit those 9/8 to 12/11 &quot;semi-tones&quot; I enjoy so much (IMVHO those &quot;alternative semi-tones&quot; are a bit tense, but sound more like 10/9 than anything else and seem not so tense they can&apos;t be stacked in chords...unlike the usual 15/14-16/15 semi-tone which to me sounds horrific when clustered like that in chords).</p><p>-Michael</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2010 1:11:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;    Dare I ask...can you re-generate this piece using a trumpet (very dense harmonic/overtone set) as the main instrument?

Check my folder in the &quot;files&quot; section.  Rendered it with the filter off on the sawtooth patch, and with the piano switched to a (non-vibratoed) horn section patch.  I had to look for a while just to find a brass patch that didn&apos;t incorporate a vibrato/chorus effect!  Anyway, I think these timbres would be offensive no matter what scale they&apos;re played in, but hey--you asked for it!  I could also try a guitar patch if you want something more &quot;middle of the road&quot;, but I think that between these two version, the result is pretty clear: not totally &quot;pleasant&quot; at times, but definitely colorful, unique, and expressive!</p><p>&gt;   And far as the &quot;sweetest scale&quot;....I&apos;m still working on it.

Check my folder in the &quot;files&quot; section.  Rendered it with the filter off on the sawtooth patch&quot;<br/>     Agreed...I mean, that taking the filter off a sawtooth sounds relatively offensive in just about any tuning (and obviously in the case of my &quot;max dissonance test tuning&quot; and your song with it).  However (yes I know, I&apos;m being picky)...try substituting the trumpet with another brass instrument (full of overtones and not unrealistically loud high ones like the sawtooth)...and I&apos;m pretty sure it would make a more realistic test.  I actually learned the &quot;piano = semi-inharmonic timbre = cheating&quot; from this list as I used to test most of my tunings with pianos and responses made it clear why I should not...I didn&apos;t just bring it up out of any random picky-ness. :-D</p><p>&gt;&quot;Interesting. Looks to me like it will be great for demonstrating my<br/>theory that scales based on harmonic ideals tend to suffer a loss of<br/>melodic expressiveness (given that melodic expressiveness requires<br/>intervals of a semitone or smaller to provide &quot;ornamental flourishes&quot;)&quot;<br/>     At least on the surface my scale seems as an obvious disadvantage for &quot;melodic even-ness&quot;.<br/>     TET tunings have the advantage of having a constant ratio per step, usually I find the usable scales under those tunings require 2-3 significantly different step sizes to move melodically across the scale.  In 12TET, both the semi-tone and whole tone are needed and such the melodic intervals &quot;skew&quot; heavily between B-C and E-F, for example, because the whole-step is 2 times the size of it.<br/>     My scale has many step sizes needed to move melodically across the scale (about 12/11, 10/9, and 9/8), which seems very &quot;uneven&quot; at first.   But realize that 12/11 is only 1.03 times the size of 9/8...a big difference from the full 2/1 difference in size between the whole and half-step in 12TET.  We&apos;ll see what happens...</p><p>&gt;&quot;Maybe you could hit me with a prototype, I&apos;ll compose something in it,<br/>and then I can retune it as you iron out any further kinks?&quot;<br/>Considering I&apos;m pretty sure my latest proto-type has each note within about 7 cents of the final scale, that would probably be a good idea.  I&apos;ll hand you over the prototype scale most likely some time this weekend.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2010 6:44:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris&gt;&quot;Igs - you are my point in the &quot;make micro music popular debate&quot; - the<br/>composer - not the tuning - is the most important part of the<br/>equation!&quot;</p><p>    I must point out, I never dis-agreed with said-above point.  I just added to it &quot;however,  improving the tuning used can make a bad composer sound decent, a good composer sound great, and a great composer sound absolutely fantastic&quot;.   In other words, next to compositional skill, I think tuning is a very important factor.  It&apos;s like comparing Michael Andretti&apos;s lap times in an F1 car (the equivalent of a &quot;great&quot; tuning) vs. in a Corvette (the equivalent of a &quot;not-so-great tuning&quot;) to an average driver&apos;s times in an Indy car.</p><p>  Of course, Andretti will likely beat the average driver&apos;s F1 times &quot;even&quot; in a Corvette because he&apos;s so much more of a talented driver...but you&apos;d better believe he&apos;ll best his Corvette lap times by a good deal in an Indy car!<br/>    To test this additional theory to what we both agree on (that the composer is the most important factor)...we&apos;ll have to see what happens with Iglishon (who is kind of like Michael Andretti in the example) composes with my consonant tuning and see if he turns from &quot;great&quot; to &quot;fantastic&quot;.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/1/2010 8:17:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here is the prototype &quot;tempered&quot; version of my &quot;maximum average consonance&quot; scale:</p><p>159.2154  (1.096328)<br/>380.5259  (1.245828)<br/>551.2827  (1.374972)<br/>696.1746  (1.495)<br/>878.5709  (1.661104)<br/>1043.5672 (1.827206)<br/>1200      (2/1)</p><p>...lets see how this does vs. my &quot;maximum dissonance scale&quot;. :-D</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/1/2010 2:18:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, in the spirit of fairness, I wrote a piece with the same instruments and channel settings, same tempo and meter, same length (more or less) and same structure as &quot;Atlantean Geometry&quot;.

Again, the version I sent you is called a prototype because (much due to only limited compositional experience which the scale myself) and there are a couple of ratios such as 18/11 which occasionally show up and I consider significantly more dissonant than the others...and between the two I realize the scale isn&apos;t quite final yet.  For the record, I was aiming the get most of the 6th-ish dyads to match at either 8/5 or 13/8 or 5/3...but a couple I realize fall a bit &quot;off&quot;...not that they beat a whole lot but have sour &quot;moods&quot; (the 18/11 in particular seems to have this issue).</p><p>&gt;&quot;I felt like the scale often seemed to &quot;fight&quot; the direction I wanted<br/>the chords to progress, though sometimes I got some really sweet<br/>changes that surprised me.&quot;<br/>    One thing is for sure...it fights 12TET a lot in that a lot of the intervals change.  The usual 5/3 is often replaced with a 8/5.  The 13/8 is often replaced with an 11/6 or 9/5.  The &quot;half step&quot; nears the 11/10 near a step in 7TET.  And the whole step generally varies between 6/5 and 11/9.  Thus there are no guarantees a chord will sound the same when played from a different root...but consonance/&quot;tension&quot; should merge toward being fairly uniform across the board IE even if the chord isn&apos;t &quot;predictable&quot; the consonance should be.<br/>   The &quot;really sweet changes&quot; you mention should ideally (if the scale is working relatively as planned) equate to &quot;not the chord I expected, but still gives an equally-or-better consonance in sound&quot;...does this seem to be the case or, if not, what is the case? :-D</p><p>&gt;&quot;And FWIW, this scale would be very well rendered in 31-tET.&quot;<br/>  Cool I will try that. :-)</p><p>&gt;&quot;and the overall feel of the scale I found to be a bit bland.&quot;<br/>    Bland as in...using too-well-known intervals or what exactly?   I&apos;m not here for the ego I&apos;m here to develop the scale...so shoot me some of the chords and such you find &quot;bland&quot; and I&apos;ll definitely look into if I can find any patterns I can figure out a way to improve on.</p><p>   I know, for one, I&apos;ve been itching to fit in a  27/20 AKA 1.35 ratio in there...but can&apos;t figure out how to without screwing a whole bunch of other ratios up.  Also more 7/4&apos;s (I think the original has just one 7/4-like dyad possible would be nice if I could figure out how to make it without knocking a bunch of other intervals into &quot;beating hell&quot;)...not to say beating is bad but that I don&apos;t think I could get non-xen-tonal listeners to go for it.</p><p>BTW, dare I ask, what are, say, your 5 favorite scales ever?</p><p>&gt;&quot;And FWIW, this scale would be very well rendered in 31-tET.&quot;<br/>Cool...I will definitely try that and see what the &quot;approximation&quot; in 31TET is.
