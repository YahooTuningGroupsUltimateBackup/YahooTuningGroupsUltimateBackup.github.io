After so much time spent researching and performing,<br/> you too are weakening your work by barking up this ridiculous tree.<br/>  &gt;&gt;</p><p>Though I don&apos;t approve of your threatening to leave the list all the time, I<br/>do want others on the list to contribute.  To that end, intimidation is the<br/>wrong end by you or any other.  To characterize another&apos;s deep held beliefs<br/>as &quot;ridiculous&quot; is demeaning and unnecessary.  One&apos;s lifetime achievements<br/>are not jeopardized by the serious examination of any term on this list.<br/>Unless you want to be Marpurg to my Kirnberger...</p><p>Re: a Greek derivation of mikro: we do not speak Greek.  My grandfather was<br/>Greek by it has not influenced my life much since I never had the opportunity<br/>to see him as died before I was born.  Most of the musical terms used from<br/>ancient Greece have totally different meanings today (e.g. enharmonic).<br/>Besides, &quot;micro&quot; of microphone takes an already audible voice and raises its<br/>amplitude so that there is are meaning to a &quot;micro&quot; that actually increases<br/>sound level.  In a similar way, one might define microtonality as a means to<br/>enlarge the tonal vocabulary.</p><p>Re: &quot;microtone&quot; - though Ezra Sims did aid the Harvard Dictionary early on<br/>with a definition  of &quot;an interval smaller than a semitone&quot; while he was a<br/>librarian at Harvard, Mark Lindley expanded upon the definition in the New<br/>Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians in his article &quot;microtone.&quot;  It<br/>begins with the early Sims definition, but acknowledges that &quot;others extend<br/>it to all music with intervals markedly different from the (logarithmic) 12th<br/>part of the octave and its multiples, including such scales with fewer than<br/>12 pitches as are used for example in Southeast Asia (Lindley 1980:279)</p><p>Ates Orga in an article entitled &quot;Alois Haba and Microtonality&quot; wrote  that<br/>during the 19th century &quot;folklorists were well aware of the microtonal<br/>structures of traditional music.&quot; (Orga 1968:541).  Orga must be wrong to<br/>you, for there are no intervals smaller than a semitone in the folk music<br/>being discussed.  It is the larger intervals that are &quot;maligned.&quot;</p><p>There are others on this list who hear and understand music similarly to the<br/>way I do.  I recall Danlee Mitchell declared himself &quot;not a microtonalist&quot; in<br/>one of Jonathan Glasier&apos;s Interval roundtables, and maybe you do not consider<br/>yourself as one.  As director of the American Festival of Microtonal Music<br/>since 1981, it is only natural to object to a &quot;small-minded&quot; definition of<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; so that it truly reflects the power that the music has,<br/>distinguished primarily by its intonational variations.</p><p>Please, Jon, don&apos;t evoke the deity for fear of my damaging my own career.
