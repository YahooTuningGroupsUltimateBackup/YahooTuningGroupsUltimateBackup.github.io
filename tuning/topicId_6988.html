Does identifying f as the<br/> second chord&apos;s tonic imply a different set of ratios?<br/>  &gt;&gt;</p><p>Yes. Here are only _some_ possible versions with f (the top note) as chord<br/>fundamental and eb as (key) tonic:</p><p>&gt;8/7        or  10/9    or  9/8<br/>&gt;1/1            1/1         1/1<br/>&gt;8/5            14/9        63/40<br/>&gt;48/35          4/3         27/20</p><p>An important part of the magic of the piece is that you don&apos;t yet know if<br/>that f in the second chord is (a) a 7th subharmonic on an eb guiding tone or<br/>(b) the chordal root of a half diminished 7th chord on the V of V or (c) on a<br/>ii chord in a subdominant function.  Brahms does indeed disambiguate this pun<br/>in  the course of the composition, but wouldn&apos;t resolving the ambiguity<br/>intonationally at this point remove one of the important driving forces in<br/>the piece?</p><p>As I mentioned in my previous post, Partch uses similar progressions.  But<br/>his is a musical rhetoric that is very different to that of Brahms, and one<br/>in which this kind of punning plays no role.</p></div>
