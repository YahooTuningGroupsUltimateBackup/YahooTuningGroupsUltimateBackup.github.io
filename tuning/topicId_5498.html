In this case, I&apos;ll use it as a<br/>way to define the equal divisions of the octave that would render a<br/>scale of ten notes comprised of seven large step sizes and three small<br/>step sizes (and more generally, where L=L s=s, and, L&gt;s &amp; s&gt;0).</p><p>(7)  4   1   8   5   2   9   6   3  10<br/>17 (14) 11  18  15  12  19  16  13  20<br/>27  24 (21)(28) 25  22  29  26  23  30<br/>37  34  31  38 (35) 32  39  36  33  40<br/>47  44  41  48  45 (42)(49) 46  43  50<br/>57  54  51  58  55  52  59 (56) 53  60<br/>67  64  61  68  65  62  69  66 (63)(70)</p><p>By setting the horizontal cut-off point of this table at L=s+10, you<br/>not only stave off an inexorable march to ~3e, but you also clearly<br/>define the EDO&apos;s [equally divided octaves] where s=(-n), and where<br/>s=0. And as the 7L 3s scale can be seen here as a linear mapping of an<br/>interval &gt;2/7 &amp; &lt;3/10 (or their inversions, i.e., &gt;7/10 &amp; &lt;5/7), any<br/>EDO that does not have an interval inside of this 1/70 space will map<br/>as s=(-n), and will therefore be incapable of rendering a (functional)<br/>scale (of 7L 3s). By the same token it&apos;s also clear to see that the<br/>EDO&apos;s that only have an interval that is exactly equal to 2/7 or 3/10,<br/>are also multiples of 7L where s=0, and as such, that they too are<br/>also incapable of rendering the scale. All EDO&apos;s &gt;7*10, e.g. L*(L+s),<br/>will have an interval &gt;2/7 &amp; &lt;3/10, and therefore all of them will<br/>also create a 10-note linear sequence of 7L &amp; 3s.

Does that fact that MOS&apos;s have a like proportion of semitone<br/>&gt; steps<br/>&gt; in all interval classes have anything to do with anything?  Can anybody<br/>&gt; hear it in Gregorian chant, as the authors claim (page 66)?  What about<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; scales where semitones aren&apos;t so rare (say 3 + 4 scales)?  What about<br/>&gt; tunings where the size of the semitone approaches the size of the whole<br/>&gt; tone (such as the diatonic scale in 47tET)?</p><p>I don&apos;t think &quot;self-similarity&quot; is the right word for it.  But whatever,<br/>it might have some meaning in some musics.  The fact that a scale covering<br/>an octave will have proportionately the same number of semitones as the<br/>same scale covering a fourth is useful to know.  But you&apos;d expect this to<br/>happen for an MOS, because the rarer steps size is evenly distributed.<br/>Inventing a term and then declaring it to be redundant is a bit odd.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/1999 8:32:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;Does that fact that MOS&apos;s have a like proportion of semitone steps<br/>&gt;&gt;in all interval classes have anything to do with anything?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Can you explain this claim more clearly?</p><p>I assumed reading of the paper.

These ratios are the best approximations to 2/7<br/>and 5/7 with denominator five.  2/7 and 5/7 are the ratios of s and L steps<br/>in any octave span, respectively.  And the authors show that this is the<br/>case for all melodic intervals in the diatonic scale (and in any WFS/MOS),<br/>and propose that diatonic music takes advantage of this sort of scaling<br/>symmetry.</p><p>I think it&apos;s bunk.  There are two ways to test it I could think of.  First,<br/>you can listen to Gregorian chant and see if you can hear it.  The authors<br/>imply (on pg. 66) that it is easy to hear in chant because it&apos;s one of the<br/>only tricks being turned, in a manner of speaking.</p><p>Another way would be to ask if this sort of thing would be at all<br/>discernable in scales where the semitone steps are less rare (like 3 + 4<br/>scales), or where they differ in size by far less (like the diatonic scale<br/>in 47tET), and if not to play music in such scales and see if they still<br/>work melodically.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/1999 1:18:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I noticed that a host of old disembodied posts have suddenly<br/>materialized just in time for Halloween...</p><p>[me:]<br/>&gt; &gt; s=(-n), just means that the small step<br/>&gt; &gt; size is a negative number,<br/>[Graham Breed:]<br/>&gt; s&lt;0, then.</p><p>Well I find that being able to see in a glance the EDOs that don&apos;t<br/>work in a particular mapping (where s=(-n)), to also be a useful<br/>convenience... but as you point out, not a musically significant<br/>mapping.</p><p>[Graham:]<br/>&gt; Yes, it can be clearly defined at a glance, so no need for all this<br/>verbiage.</p><p>Yes... verbiage...
