I suggest you to start the wide field of applications of the true octave, with your knowledges and experience you are one of  the needed men to achieve these targets. I am an old man that already needs to rest instead of facing contrarieties like those I have with Steve Parker.</p><p>Thanks<br/>Mario<br/>July, 24<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>Re: The true octave</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Steve Parker &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Can someone - anyone - explain to me why I should not accept a 2/1<br/>&gt; octave by definition?<br/>&gt; Another tuning of the octave may sound nice, have cute mathematical<br/>&gt; properties or some other utility, but as it stands 2/1 &apos;defines&apos; an<br/>&gt; octave.<br/>&gt; Either way stop calling it &apos;true&apos;.</p><p>2/1 is a JI octave by definition. Like any other JI interval, it can be detuned,<br/>either as a part of a regular temperament tuning or irregularly. If you detune<br/>it regularly, you&apos;ve now got a certain fixed tuning for it, just as detunintg<br/>3/2 to 700 cents gives you a<br/>new fixed tuning for that. Calling the tempered octave &quot;true&quot; is a bit like a<br/>fervent believer in 12 equal calling 700 cents true, I suppose.</p><p>Some people like to announce the One True Tuning, which for some people can<br/>change from day to day and with other people seems fixed for their lifetime.<br/>It&apos;s just a psychological fact of life in the alternative tuning world, one<br/>which sometimes leads to friction since no one else ever seems to climb aboard<br/>the One True Tuning train of any of these proposals.</p></div>
