Below are<br/>24 &quot;magic&quot; q-comma meantones for all the different values of q<br/>which keep things less than or equal to 200 times the base<br/>beat. I give the q for the q-comma, the beat ratio, and the<br/>maximum ratio of the base beat to the others. This is probably not<br/>the best way to evaluate what should be considered suitably magic,<br/>but it seems no matter how you slice it, a lot of historical<br/>temperaments are turning up. This means that while Paul has given<br/>cogent historical evidence against Robert&apos;s thesis, there is also this<br/>sort of evidence in its favor. Temperaments which have that<br/>fascinatin&apos; rhythm do keep turning up.</p><p>Note also that while the q-values are good only for meantone, the beat<br/>ratios are the same magic ones which would turn up in any other regular temperament.

That&apos;s why tempering exists in the first<br/>place. My approach is to take the simplest, most fundamental<br/>parameters, the ones that imply the most about everything else, and<br/>work with them.</p><p>I have trouble buying that close- or spread-voiced matters, since all<br/>that octave displacement does to an interval is invert it and double<br/>or halve the beat rate on that interval. For example, if you use the<br/>first inversion of a close-voiced, root-position triad in which the<br/>m3/M3 beat ratio is 2.0, the major sixth that encompasses this<br/>inversion will beat at exactly the same rate as the major third on<br/>top does. This is very audible in the octave below middle C (C3-C4)<br/>on real, rather inharmonic strings.</p><p>I consequently do NOT find it easy to believe that musicians as<br/>sensitive to subtle differences in tuning as those of Zarlino&apos;s day<br/>manifestly were, would fail to notice beat synchrony. If you&apos;ve<br/>played with it for real and not just on paper, it&apos;s very much in your<br/>face! And anyone sophisticated enough to describe a temperament<br/>accurately in mathematical terms, is a musician, and has actually<br/>GOTTEN HIS HANDS DIRTY TUNING REAL STRINGS, is not likely to miss<br/>that it&apos;s there! It&apos;s slow enough and audible enough to use as a<br/>guide in both setting and checking accuracy in meantone temperaments.</p><p>At this stage, I have tuned many times on real acoustic strings, with<br/>inharmonicity and all, a lot of different meantones, well<br/>temperaments, and some modified meantones. I have designed six<br/>temperaments that have received such strongly favorable views from<br/>top professional tuners that six of them are going into the next<br/>release of Verituner.</p><p>Verituner finally got to where when they heard through the grape vine<br/>that I&apos;d come up with a new temperament, they contacted me asked if<br/>they could include it. I have received emails from professionals, one<br/>who tuned conservatory pianos, who went bananas over my<br/>temperaments...people I&apos;ve never heard of. I get emails from<br/>professional tuners who say their clients raved about &quot;whatever they<br/>did&quot;, and &quot;please do it again&quot;, when the client had no idea that my<br/>temperaments were on their instrument. [Many professionals into<br/>alternative temperaments do not mention to clients they&apos;re doing<br/>anything different the first time they put a sufficiently mild well<br/>temperament on their piano. :) ]</p><p>I assure you, all this hullabaloo is no accident. As far as I&apos;m<br/>concerned, it&apos;s the proof of the proverbial pudding from practical<br/>professionals and their clients who have actually tasted it. It<br/>absolutely confirms my own aural experience, and I don&apos;t think there<br/>is anyone on this list who is very familiar with me who worries much<br/>about the accuracy of my ear.</p><p>Major triads in close-voiced root position with 1.50, and especially<br/>2.00 beat ratios between the thirds sound wonderful in spread<br/>position. Such a 2.0 triad spread out as C3-G3-E4, for example, will<br/>have, for every five beats on the tenth encompassing the chord, ten<br/>(2/1) on the major sixth at the top and one beat on the fifth at the<br/>bottom. This sounds gorgeous; much better than the close-voiced chord<br/>because the beats are slower. (The common harmonics occur lower<br/>in the series, since the spread position imitates their corresponding<br/>order in the harmonic series.)</p><p>So why all this concern about potentially invalid projections from<br/>close-voiced position? The mathematics is elementary arithmetic, and<br/>the ear can hear this without any problem. People love the<br/>smooth &quot;tremolo&quot; voice it gives to the voicing of the instrument, and<br/>the harmonic/melodic clarity and color.</p><p>The beat synchrony makes the key color of well temperaments more<br/>obvious and more charming. Tuners repeatedly tell me, &quot;That piano<br/>never sounded so good!&quot; We&apos;re talking about several different<br/>synchronous temperaments, including my Synchronous ET Equivalent,<br/>where the only significant difference from ET is the synchrony all<br/>around the circle.</p><p>This is not me talking theory, dang it! I&apos;m telling you what it<br/>SOUNDS like. Try it, tune it, if you can, and then come back and tell<br/>me it&apos;s irrelevant, and that these ancient musicians didn&apos;t even<br/>notice it! I don&apos;t need any historical documentation to tell that<br/>they did. If they weren&apos;t *#*@*&amp;^@!! deaf, they HEARD it! And I bet<br/>they used it like any intelligent tuner trying set those meantones by<br/>ear would eventually end up learning to do even if no one ever<br/>mentioned it to them.</p><p>:) Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p><p>P.S. I&apos;ve played &quot;flat third&quot; chords (e.g., C-G-E-Bb-EB), &quot;stacked<br/>fourths&quot; (e.g., Bb-E-A-D-G-C, which is harmonically equivalent to an<br/>extended Cm7 with the root at the top and the seventh on the bottom),<br/>etc. in every key on a couple of my milder synchronous wells and they<br/>sound wonderful! They have a harmonic sheen and clarity that is<br/>missing in equal temperament. They glisten, and it is magical. That&apos;s<br/>the word, Gene! You hit it. It&apos;s plain magical! And there is no<br/>harmony that doesn&apos;t work in such a mild, synchronous well.</p></div><h3><a id=42616 href="#42616">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2003 9:45:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i don&apos;t know if 3/14-comma is &quot;magic&quot;, but it and<br/>&gt; &gt; 7/26-comma are the only fraction-of-a-comma meantones<br/>&gt; &gt; in my list that you left out of yours ... was that<br/>&gt; &gt; simply an oversight, or are those two not &quot;magic&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Magic&quot; is a relative term.

(correct me if i&apos;m<br/>&gt; wrong bob.)</p><p>Yes, you&apos;re right, but my Natural Synchronous Well has no compromised<br/>ratios at all, unless you want to count the ratio in the C major<br/>triad going from 2.00000.... to 2.0016 because I put the spare change<br/>there (0.0058 cents) left over for the Pythagorean comma.</p><p>However, it isn&apos;t possible, I have pretty much concluded, to have<br/>any other tuning in a cycle of 12 fifths limited to perfect 1.50 and<br/>2.00 beat ratios. That&apos;s why I call it the Natural, because it just<br/>works out that way. I didn&apos;t make it happen that way (no choice<br/>involved; just a discovery). It&apos;s simply a mathematically beautiful<br/>thing that it does.</p><p>Anything else is going to require some compromised ratios. Since the<br/>whole idea of synchronized beating is to compensate that there is<br/>inevitable beating in the first place (i.e., tempering<br/>or &quot;necessarily compromised tuning&quot;). The most heavily mistuned<br/>triads are the ones most in need of precisely synchronized beats.<br/>Where the beats are slow and therefore relatively unimportant to the<br/>ear, we can compromise the beat ratios most and get away with it.</p><p>So yes, 2.00 +-0.08 is the high side of my tolerance (the Wendell<br/>Very Mild Synchronous Well) so far except on C, where I have<br/>compromised with 1.86 versus 2.0. However, the C major is the<br/>cleanest, nearest just of all the triads. It sounds lovely at +7.9<br/>cents with a 1.86 beat ratio (m3/M3). This is the most conservative<br/>of all my temperament designs, deliberately aimed at tuners who wish<br/>to try an alternative to ET without feeling any need to advise their<br/>clients. I have received great feedback on this from two top members<br/>of the Piano Technicians Guild, one of whom has several temperaments<br/>with his name on them.</p><p>So this very mild well uses a deliberate &quot;tempering&quot; of the beat<br/>ratios in the opposite direction from the tempering of the<br/>intonation. That is, the perfect ratios are in the most remote keys<br/>where the tuning is most compromised and the most heavily compromised<br/>ratios are on the side of the circle nearest C where the intonation<br/>is purest.</p><p>I have noticed empirically that 2.0 offers the most room for<br/>variation before it ceases to sound synchronous, since it is the<br/>simplest of all the ratios except 1/1. Further, the slower the beat<br/>rate, the less obvious any variation from 2.0 becomes. If you think a<br/>second, you will realize that 2.08 implies 20.8 beats for every ten<br/>instead of 20. When the beat rate is slow, this is not very<br/>noticeble.</p><p>I find it interesting to observe that this phenomenon is quite the<br/>opposite of what we find in intonation. The conceptual equivalents of<br/>1/1 and 2/1 beat ratios, unisons and octaves, are the least tolerant<br/>of any mistuning. In the case of beat synchrony, however, we are not<br/>dealing with interference among the strongest, lowest-order common<br/>harmonics or, in the case of unisons, directly between common<br/>fundamentals, as we are in intonation. We are simply dealing with<br/>rhythmic perception, and at a fairly subtle perceptual level to boot.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3><a id=42660 href="#42660">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Wendell &#x3C;rwendell@cangelic.org&#x3E; &#x3C;rwendell@cangelic.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2003 8:03:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus<br/>&gt; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; bob isn&apos;t really using it for meantone -- his contributions to<br/>&gt; &gt; Verituner are all well-temperaments, i believe . . .</p><p>All but one, which is a modified meantone with the widest major third<br/>on Db/C# at +21.5 cents, so if you don&apos;t mind fully Pythagorean<br/>thirds, it doubles as a well. That was not intention, however. I<br/>wanted a relatively homogeneous tuning from Bb major to A major (a<br/>range of keys that encompass the triads on Eb and E), but wanted to<br/>add a triad to the traditional 8 meantones both ends for a total of 8<br/>good major and 5 good minor keys, versus 6 and 3 respectively for<br/>straight, totally homogeneous meantones.</p><p>So mine began with 1/7-comma meantone as a basis, since it has 2.0<br/>beat ratios for the m3/M3 of all playable major triads. I bent it at<br/>the ends so that at Bb and Eb we&apos;e just nipping the underside of 12-<br/>tET and then it swoops sharply upward to max width for the third on<br/>C#. The result is much nicer than ET in the six traditional meantone<br/>keys, but still quite playable in the extensions to Eb major and E<br/>major at opposite ends of the traditional range.</p><p>The purpose was to provide a modern practical performance option that<br/>would work for almost any music originally written for meantone<br/>without any need to retune or transpose, and yet remain much more<br/>historically informed than it would be in ET.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For which part of the circle of fifths is 1/7-comma meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>Having 2.0 beat ratios all the way around has nothing to do with 1/7-<br/>comma meantone. It has everything to do with the fifth being 1/3 as<br/>flat as the major third on the same pitch is sharp. Only that and<br/>always that will result in a 2.0 beat ratio on the resulting major<br/>triad. 1/7-comma does that, but in well temperament you can do that<br/>on all the tempered fifths if you choose them as I did for the<br/>Natural Synchronous Well.</p><p>The triad on G is closest to 1/7-comma at -3.27 cents on the fifth<br/>(versus -3.07 = 1/7th syntonic comma), but the fifths range from 1/4-<br/>comma to almost 1/9-comma and none are excatly 1/7-comma. They all<br/>have fifths 1/3 as flat as the thirds are sharp, though. That is the<br/>only necessary and also sufficient condition.</p><p>&gt; but it does seem<br/>&gt; &gt; that even beat ratios like 5:1 could be important . . . and bob<br/>does<br/>&gt; &gt; seem willing to use &quot;tempered&quot; beat ratios in this context . . .<br/>so<br/>&gt; &gt; in further research on this, why don&apos;t we use a harmonic entropy<br/>&gt; &gt; function designed to mirror tenney height up to n*d = 6 or so,<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; which is continuous everywhere?<br/>&gt;<br/>Even a 3.0 beat ratio of the minor to major third in a major triad,<br/>which I use in my Bold Synchronous Well, uses up so much of the<br/>available real estate in the requisite total of one Pythagorean comma<br/>that you can only us it once in the boldest well. The fifth has to be<br/>flat by the same amount as the third is sharp to get 3.0. If you<br/>don&apos;t want a horribly flat fifth, that means you have to use up most<br/>of your total Pythagorean real estate in four consecutive fifths.</p></div>
