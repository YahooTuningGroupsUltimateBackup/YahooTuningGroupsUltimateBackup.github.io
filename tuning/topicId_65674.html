I did NOT say the music<br/>&gt; was worthless. I did NOT say the music was soulless. I did NOT say<br/>I<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t like ANY of it, NOR did I say anything to disparage those<br/>who<br/>&gt; find that music highly enjoyable. I even went to the effort to<br/>&gt; append &quot;with the rare exception&quot; -- which apparently bypassed<br/>notice<br/>&gt; by others (with exceptions, of course!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (Actually, when someone puts words into my mouth, it illuminates<br/>&gt; their own preconceptions quite nicely, thanks.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To say I find something dull (musically) simply means that I find<br/>it<br/>&gt; uninteresting after the first hearing (and I gave many first<br/>&gt; hearings). However, this was apparently too much for others, who<br/>&gt; promptly and soundly trounced this upstart for heresy against the<br/>&gt; musical avant-garde. I was compared to creationists and<br/>reactionary<br/>&gt; politicians. Simply calling me a knuckle-dragging proto-hominid<br/>&gt; would have taken less space, I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was baldly stated that I didn&apos;t comprehend the inseperability<br/>of<br/>&gt; mathematics and music; that I didn&apos;t comprehend the 12-tone method<br/>&gt; of composition; that my opinion was anti-intellectual. I&apos;ve<br/>pointed<br/>&gt; out that I enjoy Schoenberg, Sessions, Carter etc, and that in<br/>fact<br/>&gt; I have composed a good deal of &quot;atonal&quot; music myself, earlier in<br/>my<br/>&gt; development. These inconvenient admissions went unacknowledged.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And many of these accusations came from someone who admitted to<br/>&gt; setting not a single note to even one - ONE - 12-tone composition.<br/>&gt; Hmmm.....seems to me, that I ought to be the offended party here,<br/>&gt; what with the blatant insults to my person and my intellectual<br/>&gt; integrity, and so forth. And all for saying that I found a tiny<br/>bit<br/>&gt; of music, dull. I don&apos;t recall labelling anyone effete academic<br/>&gt; dilettantes or snot-nosed-and-whiney children, for having an<br/>opinion<br/>&gt; different from my own.

Fecitiousness<br/>doesn&apos;t come across in print.</p><p>Funny though that you say the &quot;overtone series&quot; shouldn&apos;t be a sort of<br/>&quot;uber-scale.&quot;  So, what you just said is:  Overtones should be thought of<br/>as an over-scale.  Uber means OVER.  I think *some* of the false mystique<br/>and reverence for the harmonic series comes from the bad english<br/>translation of Helmholtz&apos; &quot;obertone&quot; as &quot;overtone&quot; instead of the<br/>accurate &quot;uppertone&quot;.  Upper correctly feels like these tones are the<br/>ones there, the upper ones.  Over has this kind of powerful and<br/>metaphysical connotation, like those tones exist in a higher realm.</p><p>Still, anyone exploring pitch, especially in anything beyond monophonic<br/>music, is going to find the harmonic series plays at least a large part<br/>in how they relate pitch.  Or to be more specific, the spectrum of the<br/>sounds they use will affect these things (see Bill Sethares work).  And<br/>since voice is the foundation of just about every pitch-focused music,<br/>the harmonic series is prominant whether you like it or not.  I&apos;m not<br/>placing it on a pedastel, I&apos;m just accepting reality.  And I&apos;m trying not<br/>to put any value judgment on anything.  If you want to play non-<br/>harmonic scales, and like them, that&apos;s great.  That doesn&apos;t mean<br/>that harmonics are irrelevant.</p><p>Cheers!<br/>-Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=65693 href="#65693">ðŸ”—</a>ambassadorbob &#x3C;ambassadorbob@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2006 5:32:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Wolf&quot; &lt;backfromthesilo@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Overall, I agree.

The question is whether they have a pitch in mind, and<br/>whether that is what they are in fact singing.  In other words,<br/>singing in tune is the skill of knowing what pitch is aimed for<br/>or is heard in the singer&apos;s mind, and singing that pitch.  There<br/>is no such thing as an out-of-tune pitch, if the pitch is what<br/>was desired.

I simply,<br/>can say what I like.  But even beating is a phenomena that relates<br/>to acoustics, overtone series, etc.  So it STILL plays a part.  It seems<br/>to me that you are still tending to want to write off the whole of what<br/>some theorists are expressing.  As an analogy, if I don&apos;t agree as a<br/>whole with a particular religion or philosophy, it would be terrible<br/>to then reject any idea that is included in it.

It simply means that you<br/>are treating each idea on its own merits.</p><p>You went and attached a bunch of tuning ideas to my statement<br/>that the harmonic series plays into thing prominantly.

However, the extent to<br/>which market conditions apply to seriously non-commercial musics is<br/>definitely debatable. I happen to think that musics outside of the market<br/>economy provide a serious instrument for resisting those forces, but<br/>that may just be me, and I will also vigorously defend the right of any listener<br/>to hear whatever music they like without paying attention to the<br/>social or political context.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=65709 href="#65709">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2006 2:56:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Abhorrent, really, with all due respect to good ol&apos; Marxists.</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:genewardsmith@coolgoose.com">genewardsmith@coolgoose.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 25 Mart 2006 Cumartesi 11:02<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Presumptions</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.Smith&quot; &lt;jsmith9624@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; About two years ago, I read a book by a Marxist academician...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s this whole Marxist argument in favor of serialism, in that it<br/>&gt; treats each note the same and hence is poltically better, whereas<br/>&gt; tonality introduces hierarchical arrangements, with the tonic as king.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think we need take this seriously as music theory, any more<br/>&gt; than the corresponding thing in math which says geometry is more<br/>&gt; politically correct than algebra.
