I&apos;ve decided to publish the score without the original microtonal accidentals because (a) as each movement is limited to seven pitches, it&apos;s easy enough to play without them, and (b) any of the competing systems floating around today can be added in, if needed, by hand.</p><p>the score is here:  <a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/QuartetI.pdf">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/QuartetI.pdf</a></p><p>The piece originally had a fast fourth movement; like many other things from the &apos;70s, it&apos;s gone walkies and is probably not missed.</p><p>djw</p></div>
