One of<br/>the reasons is the fact that it was the patch I could find that had the<br/>LEAST vibrato.  I&apos;m sorry to say that some of my previous findings were<br/>&quot;colored&quot; by the fact that the synth ADDED vibrato to the 12t-ET version<br/>of the tuning, so the beating effect was more prominent than it should<br/>have been.  Well that certainly added to the &quot;success&quot; of the<br/>experiment!  However, the real effect is subtle, at best.  But, one can<br/>still clearly hear the difference.</p><p>2) &quot;Tripod,&quot; the web host, is a little &quot;funky&quot; in the upload<br/>department.  When you click on the file, it takes one to ANOTHER page<br/>for the upload...  With a little patience, however, everything should be<br/>OK.</p><p>I still haven&apos;t been able to figure out how to &quot;stream&quot; these files.<br/>Anybody know?? I asked around at CompuServe, and they thought THEIR<br/>server couldn&apos;t handle them.... but, I am not so certain about<br/>&quot;Tripod&quot;...</p><p>Finally...  a couple of times, when I played my &quot;uploads&quot; they got cut<br/>off.  I hope this doesn&apos;t happen to you!  :)  Maybe it&apos;s related to<br/>traffic on the site.</p><p>In any case, with only a little patience you should be able to hear the<br/>files.  They ARE working. I&apos;m hoping to continue to do this audio<br/>posting in the future, since, as you can see, the discussion was already<br/>on the list, but there was no way for listers to really hear what I was<br/>experiencing.  This should make for a much more &quot;multimedia&quot; tuning<br/>experience...</p><p>Any comments will be, as ever, greatly appreciated...</p><p>___________ ____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
