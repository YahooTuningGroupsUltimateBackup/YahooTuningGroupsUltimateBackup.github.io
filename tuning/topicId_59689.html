A point here is to locate the<br/>Bach expectations within musical and historical context, which<br/>presupposes the reader&apos;s ability to hear and compare this with other<br/>contemporary layouts (including Neidhardt&apos;s and Sorge&apos;s, for the<br/>adventurous and thorough!).</p><p>Notice that my suggestion *does not* say listen to MIDI files run<br/>through a computer.  That in itself might be interesting, but Bach<br/>could not have done so.  It&apos;s up to hands-on playing on acoustic<br/>instruments, experiencing them by *playing* the repertoire directly<br/>and noting what it does to your own sense of melody/harmony/timing,<br/>as to the tensions and resolutions in the music.  Bach wrote the WTC<br/>for musicians to work on in their own keyboard practice and lessons.<br/>If he somehow also envisioned computer-listening or recording-<br/>listening at some point in his distant future, with people having the<br/>music played for them passively by a machine, that would really be<br/>something else!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Several Bach compositions are demonstrated directly in<br/>&gt; &gt; recorded examples at<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/samples.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/samples.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt; with four full-length CDs to be released shortly.  Those are<br/>&gt; &gt; played on organ and harpsichord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These aren&apos;t even comparisons -- only your temperament is<br/>&gt; demonstrated.</p><p>And those are for people who don&apos;t play keyboards at all, so they can<br/>at least hear the music on appropriate acoustic instruments with the<br/>proposed tuning.  Broader comparisons require actually doing some<br/>homework: finding other comparative recordings by other people, and<br/>(better yet) hands-on playing of the repertoire oneself.  I&apos;m not<br/>going to have multiple additional recording sessions and production<br/>cost, just to excuse people from going and doing their own homework<br/>and investigations....!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, it seems very unlikely that the Kleines Harmonisches<br/>&gt; Labyrinth was written by Bach.</p><p>I have addressed exactly that question of authenticity in the Oxford<br/>supplement to part 2 of the article, as part of discussing that<br/>piece.  Some _Bach-Jahrbuch_ articles, and indeed a recent volume of<br/>the _Neue Bach-Ausgabe_ (2003) as well, do include this piece in the<br/>Bach repertoire after all.  The books/articles I&apos;ve cited are from<br/>2000, 2001, and 2003 on this.  And yes, I know that Ledbetter in 2002<br/>and Williams in 2003 continue to vote it out, and that the 1998 BWV<br/>still has it in the &quot;questionable&quot; index.</p><p>Whether some people would allow this composition as a testing example<br/>or not, based *only* on the question whether Bach himself wrote it<br/>(to everybody&apos;s unanimous satisfaction), is to miss the broader<br/>point.  The piece, as it stands, is a useful one with which to<br/>explore temperament issues hands-on.  And it&apos;s a fairly easy one to<br/>play, too, on any keyboard: with only one optional pedal-point in the<br/>last section, or just restrike it a couple of times if there&apos;s no<br/>pedalboard available.</p><p>As I mentioned here a couple of days ago, the four Duetti BWV 802-5<br/>are even better in that regard as hands-on test pieces, and they are<br/>unquestionably by JSB.  There&apos;s nowhere for any less-than-worthy<br/>temperament to hide in their brutally exposed texture of two voices,<br/>either melodically or with two-note intervals harmonically.</p><p>Bradley Lehman</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2005 11:55:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; On Friday 19 August 2005 12:57 am, monz wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... too bad that the Yahoo search feature sucks so much<br/>&gt; &gt; that i&apos;m not willing to invest the time to look for<br/>&gt; &gt; his posts ... but hopefully someone else will.<br/>&gt; &gt; They&apos;re in here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where where you Monz, when I suggested we move over<br/>&gt; to Google groups for that very reason? ;)</p><p>I was busy working on the new Tonalsoft website ...<br/>where *we* plan to eventually host the tuning list!</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2005 1:59:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/testpieces.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/testpieces.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s just a list of pieces.

While you might get some interesting results playing<br/>&gt; some of Bach&apos;s music in it, I would not expect anything in the key of<br/>&gt; A major (its worst triad) to fare particularly &quot;well&quot; (pun intended.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Rather than &quot;expecting&quot; some, or speculating, how about tuning a harpsichord and an organ this way and playing some?  From more than a year of doing so, A major has become one of my favorite keys to play in and listen to, with its melodic smoothness and the brightness of those sharps. The note C#, as it turns out, is exactly midway between A and F.  One could turn your observations right around and say them the other way: in other temperaments, the interval Db-F is so much worse than A-C# that the music played using it (such as quite a bit of Bach&apos;s in F minor) &quot;doesn&apos;t fare particularly well&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Besides this, there&apos;s a wide fifth (Bb-F) that, strictly speaking,<br/>&gt; would by itself exclude this temperament from the &quot;well-temperament&quot;<br/>&gt; category, inasmuch as this causes the total error of the intervals in<br/>&gt; the 12 major triads (379.3c) to exceed the minimum theoretically<br/>&gt; possible (387.5c).</p><p>No, look again: *strictly speaking* that interval is the diminished 6th A#-F.

Believe me, I was as skeptical/dubious as anybody BEFORE setting it up on harpsichord and playing it for a bit; it looks ludicrous on paper IN SPECULATION but music isn&apos;t speculation.</p><p>Also keep in mind that your argument from &quot;the well-temperament category&quot; here is based on a *modern* definition made up by Owen Jorgensen et al; there&apos;s nothing historically that would constrain Bach to conform to categories made up a couple hundred years after he was gone.</p><p>&gt; My reason for bringing this point up is not to<br/>&gt; nitpick about a categorical technicality, but rather to make the<br/>&gt; point that the inclusion of a wide fifth is *totally unnecessary* in<br/>&gt; a temperament in which the narrowest fifths are tempered only 1/6 of<br/>&gt; a pythagorean comma (see following paragraph).</p><p>I see that Jorgensen&apos;s speculative notions about the undesirability of &quot;harmonic waste&quot; are alive and well.  But within such a paradigm, where the expectations *have been made up in the 20th century*, of course my solution is going to be judged and found wanting.  The key here is to come to it with 17th century expectations and habits, and then to see/hear how new it is against that background.  Against *that* relief it sounds so smoothly equal and so unremarkable that it doesn&apos;t call a huge amount of attention *to itself*, but rather it calls attention to the *the music* and the way tonal progressions behave.</p><p>Keep in mind that Bach was as master of harmony, both simple and complex. A couple of days ago I played through the &quot;Schmucke dich&quot; BWV 654 and the &quot;Nun komm der heiden Heiland&quot; BWV 659, marveling at the blend of harmonic/melodic motion in these pieces, in this tuning (there is a pipe organ tuned this way in Indiana, and a second one being completed now in Helsinki).  In that same session I played through the &quot;Liebster Jesu&quot; settings BWV 633-634 [in A major!] with their canons, suspended 6ths, D#s, etc...*musically* it&apos;s wonderful.  And obviously there&apos;s no way I can convince anybody who would prefer his/her own speculations on paper ahead of listening to and actually *playing* the music hands-on.</p><p>For any who are willing to listen, there is a BBC radio 3 program about this on Sunday, and available on the web all next week:<br/><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/earlymusicshow/pip/z9s45/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/earlymusicshow/pip/z9s45/</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I found on this website:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.rollingball.com/TemperamentsFrames.htm">http://www.rollingball.com/TemperamentsFrames.htm</a><br/>&gt; a 1/6-pythagorean-comma well-temperament (Valotti-Young, 1799) that&apos;s<br/>&gt; a perfect (even if &quot;unauthentic&quot;) alternative to Lehman-&quot;Bach&quot;.</p><p>What do you mean &quot;unauthentic&quot;?  Werckmeister knew the simple layout of six chained tempered 5ths, contrasted against the other six chained pure 5ths, in the 1680s as a typical Venetian style.

Why would Bach care about that?  My hypothesis is that Bach used the term _wohltemperirt_ to mean this specific layout that he wrote down himself; and if some people *today* can&apos;t accept that it might have a wide &quot;5th&quot; (really a diminished 6th) in it, or the little zigzag where B major is better in tune than E major is, that&apos;s a problem of modern expectations, not a problem of Bach&apos;s practice. And to see what&apos;s in this hypothesis, please read the actual article and try the music as it recommends, rather than relying solely on internet chatter about it.</p><p>&gt; Brad, it was not my intention to be unkind in my criticism of your<br/>&gt; work, and I hope that you&apos;ll be open to reviewing your methodology in<br/>&gt; light of my observations.</p><p>I haven&apos;t taken offense at your remarks, George; it&apos;s only that I&apos;ve already covered all that ground myself in the months *before* writing the article, and indeed in the 21 years of working as a harpsichord tuner before that.  Your remarks here haven&apos;t told me anything yet that I didn&apos;t already consider *before* putting my boldly anti-establishment stuff into the article.  I know that this article calls for a paradigm shift in the way people think about and listen to temperaments, and it took me some months myself to realize what was necessary to say in it.  I had to drop the encrusted habits of 20+ years out the window myself before taking this different harmonic balance seriously myself.  And then, having heard it and played in it for a while, I had to figure out the theory as to why it works.  The layout of intervals is different enough that it calls for its own methods of analysis, arising from the sounds produced.  Its handling of tonics/dominants is simple and logical, *after* one is able to dump old habits and expectations out the window and play directly in the music, to hear what&apos;s there.</p><p>Bradley Lehman<br/><a href="http://www.larips.com">http://www.larips.com</a></p></div><h3>George D.

Put your<br/>base frequency for A in K2, the type of comma (d/p/a/s) in G3, the<br/>fraction of that comma to use as your unit of departure in G4, and<br/>the numerator of the fraction in B15.  I presently have figures<br/>entered for a regular 5/17-didymus-comma temperament with A=220, for<br/>which the intervals in a root-position major triad are all equal-<br/>beating.  If you change G4 to 7 and b15 to -1 (negative number for a<br/>*narrow* 5th), you&apos;ll see that the 1/7th-comma temperament is very<br/>close to having proportional-beating triads.</p><p>Now change G4 to 23 and b15 to -5, and you&apos;ll see that the 5/23rd-<br/>comma temperament is very close to having equal-beating 5ths and<br/>major 3rds (with minor 3rds beating 4X -- more about this below).<br/>I&apos;m a bit perplexed as to why the ratios between the beat-rates are<br/>*almost* exact integers (imprecision in the calculations perhaps, but<br/>I&apos;m not so sure).</p><p>Observe in all of the above regular temperaments that F# and Gb are<br/>different pitches.

(Note that cents for F# and Gb are now the same.)</p><p>You can construct your own temperament either by changing the numbers<br/>in the light-cyan-colored cells, or you can enter cents directly in<br/>cells E8-E19.  If your temperament does not conform to Owen<br/>Jorgensen&apos;s strict definition of a well-temperament, this will be<br/>indicated by one or more asterisks appearing in columns H, J, L, or N.</p><p>&gt; I am indeed referring to the wolf of 1/4 comma meantone which I<br/>&grave;tempered&grave; - so to speak - in such a way as to make sure the fifths<br/>do not howl anymore.

(I devised my old #1 temperament<br/>in 1964, and #2 and #3 eventually replaced it.  Now, IMO, this new #1<br/>could replace all of them.)</p><p>After listening and comparing, I&apos;ve concluded that the 8 equal- and<br/>proportional-beating major triads in this temperament sound as if<br/>they have less total error than the numbers would indicate, with the<br/>faster beats tending to be masked by the slower ones.  In conducting<br/>some head-to-head comparisons of the C and G major triads with those<br/>in 31-ET (12c total error), I found that they sound at least as good;<br/>likewise the E and Eb major triads as compared with 12-ET.  (The<br/>Scalatron permits me to jump back and forth instantly from one tuning<br/>to another, which easily allows me to make comparisons using the same<br/>timbres.)  I also found, for some reason, that the B and Ab major<br/>triads sound only about as dissonant as pythagorean triads, even<br/>though they have about 5 cents greater total error.</p><p>I was frankly a bit surprised at how quickly I was able to come up<br/>with proportional beat rates for so many triads, thinking that it<br/>should have been a lot harder to do this and beginning to experience<br/>some feelings of doubt that there must be some room for improvement --<br/> at this point I don&apos;t know.

My mistake there. But<br/>  &gt;Paul, the mistuning of the minor third is - obviously - directly<br/>  &gt;correlated to the mistuning of the major third in a consonant triad.</p><p>  Sometimes it&apos;s independent, for example if you&apos;re only specifying<br/>  absolute deviations from JI.</p><p>  &gt; I have merely proposed a model to explain the phenomenon observed.<br/>  &gt;By no means do I make any ontological claims in that respect. If the<br/>  &gt;model works, then a triad indeed should require the &quot;proportional<br/>  &gt;stretch&quot; formula to sound consonant. Do you have any relevant<br/>  &gt;evidence to the contrary?</p><p>  Not necessarily evidence, but I can propose a test. I believe that if<br/>  we&apos;re talking about a root-position close-voiced major triad,<br/>  approximating 4:5:6, and the 4:6 (or 2:3) is stretched by 20 cents,<br/>  then the triad is likely to sound more concordant when the 4:5 is<br/>  stretched by only 9 1/3 cents (and hence the 5:6 is stretched by 10<br/>  2/3 cents). The reasoning here is that 4:5 is a slightly stronger<br/>  concordance than 5:6; stronger concordances are slightly more<br/>  sensitive to mistuning than weaker ones; thus the 4:5 should be<br/>  mistuned just a bit less than the 5:6 in order to prevent one or the<br/>  other interval from being too damaged by mistuning.

However, I don&apos;t find it<br/>  particularly objectionable -- rather like a good vibrato.</p><p>Playing with dozens of 12-tone systems just showed me that beats should be calibrated in only a special way, or otherwise the temperament in question becomes intolerable.</p><p>  Anyway, I&apos;ve had a chance to play around with this on my Scalatron<br/>  the past couple of days, and I&apos;ve decided to call it &quot;#1&quot;, because I<br/>  think it tops both my #2 (well-temperament) and (in all respects) my<br/>  #3 (temperament ordinaire) tunings.  (I devised my old #1 temperament<br/>  in 1964, and #2 and #3 eventually replaced it.  Now, IMO, this new #1<br/>  could replace all of them.)</p><p>  After listening and comparing, I&apos;ve concluded that the 8 equal- and<br/>  proportional-beating major triads in this temperament sound as if<br/>  they have less total error than the numbers would indicate, with the<br/>  faster beats tending to be masked by the slower ones.  In conducting<br/>  some head-to-head comparisons of the C and G major triads with those<br/>  in 31-ET (12c total error), I found that they sound at least as good;<br/>  likewise the E and Eb major triads as compared with 12-ET.  (The<br/>  Scalatron permits me to jump back and forth instantly from one tuning<br/>  to another, which easily allows me to make comparisons using the same<br/>  timbres.)  I also found, for some reason, that the B and Ab major<br/>  triads sound only about as dissonant as pythagorean triads, even<br/>  though they have about 5 cents greater total error.</p><p>I can personally say that it is by far the most optimal solution in my opinion that deserves to replace 12-tET utilized in contemporary music education and practice worldwide.</p><p>I was frankly a bit surprised at how quickly I was able to come up<br/>with proportional beat rates for so many triads, thinking that it<br/>should have been a lot harder to do this and beginning to experience<br/>some feelings of doubt that there must be some room for improvement --<br/>at this point I don&apos;t know.  (But the more I play around with it,<br/>the less my doubt.)</p><p>Anyway, I hope that some others will try this tuning and give me your<br/>reactions -- at least go through the triads in Scala using the chord<br/>playing function in the keyboard clavier.

Observe<br/>that all of the major triads from Gb thru G have the same beat ratios.</p><p>Now that is fascinating! But how does one go to a temperament where the octave closes with equal-beating triads after, say, 30-40 tones?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Uh, slow down please! And tell me what beat-rates, or BRATS are and what their significance is in your own words.</p><p>A beat-rate is simply the number of beats per second that occur in a tempered consonance.  A triad has synchronous beating when the ratios between the beat rates for its constituent intervals can be expressed with small integers.</p><p>Okay, ratios between the beat-rates... as in the ratio of the beat rate of 5/4 to the beat rate of 3/2? In the case of 5/17-comma temperament, the major third beats 4.14 times per second and the fifth the same, so the ratio is 1/1. In the case of the 5/14-comma temperament, the BRAT of the consonant major triad is 10/5=2. I think I got it! The comma-fractions you gave yield multiples of beat-ratios. Right?</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; And what is the total error for this extra-ordinary temperament of yours?</p><p>For the 12 major triads: ~386.5 cents (in cell H21); since this isn&apos;t a well-temperament, that figure exceeds the theoretical minimum of ~375.4 cents for a curculating 12-tone temperament.</p><p>That is because you have chosen to increase the error in the remote keys in favor of the more accustomed keys. Correct?</p><p>&gt; Anyway, I hope that some others will try this tuning and give me<br/>your reactions -- at least go through the triads in Scala using the<br/>chord playing function in the keyboard clavier.

(Should the latter be the case,<br/>then I might question whether the figures are even correct to the<br/>nearest cent.)</p><p>&gt; I confess that I haven&apos;t yet managed to have a listen-in<br/>&gt; (I haven&apos;t yet succeeded in getting my computer to do<br/>&gt; this scale stuff, even with &apos;Scala&apos;, but maybe I will<br/>&gt; soon crack this thing!), but if I may add a question:-<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I notice that your temperament is defined with<br/>&gt; precision down to 10^-5 cents, while the discussion four<br/>&gt; years ago was based on trial of a temperament defined only<br/>&gt; to the nearest cent.  How much precision of implementation<br/>&gt; do you think is needed in practice to realise these<br/>&gt; internal agreements of beat-rate?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kind regards<br/>&gt; Terry Stancliffe<br/>&gt; Cambridge</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see that George replied; but one often needs far better<br/>than 1<br/>&gt; cent precision to get the beating ratios to sound audibly right. So<br/>&gt; most electronic synths are out of the question for hearing the<br/>effects.</p><p>I&apos;m inclined to agree with Paul about this.  Since the pitch<br/>increments on my Scalatron vary (from 0.8 to 1.6 cents) according to<br/>the interval the pitch makes with &quot;A&quot;, I would also have to<br/>investigate how many of the triads have the pitches close enough to<br/>exhibit the desired effect on my instrument.  (I do remember as I<br/>consulted a lookup table to set the Scalatron switches for each note,<br/>that many of the pitches were within 0.2 cents or so -- I&apos;ll have to<br/>listen closely to the beating of the individual intervals in each<br/>triad and do a qualitative comparison.  In any case, I&apos;m *extremely*<br/>happy with the way my temperament sounds.)</p><p>In attempting to analyze the temperament described by whole-cent<br/>offsets, I found that this precision is barely adequate for<br/>*determining* the intended beat rates.  For example, C-G is 3 cents<br/>narrower than in 12-ET, which would be 5 cents narrower than just,<br/>but this could apply to a 5th ranging anywhere from a 1/4-comma (5.4<br/>cents) narrow to the 5/23-comma (4.7 cents narrow) fifth that I have<br/>in my #1 temperament.  If one (reasonably) assumes that the chain of<br/>fifths from F to B are the same size and that all of the pitches in<br/>the table are indeed to the nearest cent, then the fifth must be<br/>rather closer to 5.0 cents.  But it&apos;s difficult to say for sure,<br/>since the offsets may be, at best, a second-hand description.</p><p>The text in the above link provides another clue:</p><p>&lt;&lt; In this tempering in the central keys of 1 or 2 sharps and flats,<br/>for example, beats in thirds or fifths agree with beats in sixths<br/>which creates a wonderful clarity of texture to chords and harmonies.<br/>&gt;&gt;</p><p>If &quot;agree&quot; is interpreted as a 1:1 beat-ratio, this description could<br/>apply to the F, C, and G major triads in a temperament with 5ths 5/23-<br/>comma narrow from F to B (1:1 beat ratio between 5th &amp; M3), as long<br/>as we allow a little leeway with the cents.  Using this as a starting<br/>point, I&apos;ve constructed a temperament here:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/TO-523.xls">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/TO-523.xls</a></p><p>!

An important one that doesn&apos;t is the diaschismic family, including that explained in Paul Erlich&apos;s 22 tone temperament paper.  I explain them in my website, I think at</p><p><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/diaschis.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/diaschis.htm</a></p><p>The 10 note MOS is of the form</p><p>s s s s L s s s s L</p><p>in terms of small and large intervals.  In 22-equal, the small interval is 2 steps and the large one is 3 steps.  There&apos;s no way of defining this scale with the octave as a generator, because you lose half the notes.  Hence the period has to be set at a half octave, but for convenience you can still think of the scale as being 10 notes to an octave.</p><p>Another example is the octatonic scale in 12-equal:</p><p>1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2</p><p>This repeats 4 times in an octave, and can be generalized to give a linear temperament with a period of a quarter octave.</p><p>My linear temperament searches threw up a lot of examples where the period is quite small.  They are most useful in the higher limits, and so less famous because of the difficulties involved in making music with such beasties.  My favourite is the one I call &quot;mystery&quot; which does 15-limit JI by dividing the octave into 29 equal parts, and using either 0 or 1 of the other generator (around 16 cents) to get to each 15-limit interval.</p><p>Looked at from another direction, meantone always divides the major third into two equal parts.  If, for some strange reason, you decided that the major third was to be your identity interval, the whole tone would have to be your period.  Some regular temperaments happen to equally divide an interval that wouldn&apos;t be so divisible in JI.  If one of those intervals happens to be the octave, then the octave can&apos;t be the period.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3>George D.

The period is a special kind<br/>&gt; of generator.  You need two generators to define a two-dimensional scale<br/>&gt; (or linear temperament, where the period-generator becomes invisible)<br/>&gt;</p><p>And it becomes visible in rank 3 temperaments?</p><p>&gt; Did you check 58?  It&apos;s the next step in the mystery chain.  Good for<br/>&gt; 15-limit harmony, may or may not be what you want for Maqam music.<br/>&gt;</p><p>In 58, the cycle of fifths produce super-pythagorean intervals, which do not<br/>very well suit my needs. My default is a meantone-pythagorean hybrid that<br/>closes the cycle in between 31 or 55 jumps.</p><p>&gt; Unless the identity interval is 4/1?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, you can always define it that way, but most people would be<br/>&gt; confused by an identity interval that isn&apos;t the octave.  If a scale<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t have an octave, this is unavoidable.  Otherwise, we usually<br/>&gt; divide the octave to get a new period.  It&apos;s a matter of convenience.<br/>&gt; That is, it&apos;s *supposed* to make it easier to understand.<br/>&gt;</p><p>So, the &grave;period&grave; AKA the &grave;interval of periodicity&grave; is the interval where the<br/>scale repeats itself using the exact same intervals. This generates the<br/>&grave;interval of equivalance&grave;, as in the &grave;octave&grave;, or else, is squeezed inside<br/>it any number of times.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;               Graham<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2005 3:23:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul, I did not find the oppurtunity to thank you for your informative post.

In conducting<br/>&gt; some head-to-head comparisons of the C and G major triads with those<br/>&gt; in 31-ET (12c total error), I found that they sound at least as good;<br/>&gt; likewise the E and Eb major triads as compared with 12-ET.  (The<br/>&gt; Scalatron permits me to jump back and forth instantly from one tuning<br/>&gt; to another, which easily allows me to make comparisons using the same<br/>&gt; timbres.)  I also found, for some reason, that the B and Ab major<br/>&gt; triads sound only about as dissonant as pythagorean triads, even<br/>&gt; though they have about 5 cents greater total error.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was frankly a bit surprised at how quickly I was able to come up<br/>&gt; with proportional beat rates for so many triads, thinking that it<br/>&gt; should have been a lot harder to do this and beginning to experience<br/>&gt; some feelings of doubt that there must be some room for improvement --<br/>&gt;  at this point I don&apos;t know.

Convince me<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that this isn&apos;t all a dream!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I expect you&apos;ve had plenty of feedback by now?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, but more is welcome.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, FWIW, here are my reactions to tuning up your<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;extraordinary&quot; temperament, then playing with it for<br/>&gt; &gt; an hour or so using both piano and harpsichord samples<br/>&gt; &gt; on my Roland keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Everything is fine - EXCEPT the sounds of the bare Db,<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb, E, F#, Ab and B major triads in root position with<br/>&gt; &gt; root in the octave above middle C.  Other inversions of<br/>&gt; &gt; these triads are (more or less) acceptable, while more<br/>&gt; &gt; open chords using these harmonies are fine.  Playing an<br/>&gt; &gt; accompanied melody, or improvised two- and three-part<br/>&gt; &gt; counterpoint, all sounds pleasant enough to me.  The only<br/>&gt; &gt; problem I have is with these triads in that range.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They all have total absolute error greater than the triads of 12-ET,<br/>&gt; and the problem is mostly with the thirds.  You&apos;ll need to understand<br/>&gt; that the purpose of a _temperament ordinaire_ is to have high<br/>&gt; (meantone-like) consonance in as many triads as possible after taming<br/>&gt; the &quot;wolf&quot;.  In my temperament (extra)ordinaire wolf fifths are<br/>&gt; completely eliminated.  The 3rds will of necessity be worse than in<br/>&gt; 12-ET, but the objective is to have as few &quot;worst&quot; triads as<br/>&gt; possible.</p><p>Thanks for that explanation; until now, I had no idea what<br/>the goals of a &quot;temp&iuml;&iquest;&half;rament ordinaire&quot; were.</p><p>&gt;  ... I&apos;m a bit surprised that you had problems with E and<br/>&gt; especially Eb -- I would judge them to be not significantly worse<br/>&gt; than 12-ET.  (However, see my comment about becoming &quot;spoiled&quot;,<br/>&gt; below.)</p><p>I can rule this out;  I toggled between the two tunings several times,<br/>playing identical passages in each.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I checked out the actual sizes of the fifths and thirds<br/>&gt; &gt; in all major chords.  The fifths are not a problem - by<br/>&gt; &gt; construction, almost.  (I don&apos;t really like fifths as<br/>&gt; &gt; narrow as 697 cents, but that&apos;s the price we pay for<br/>&gt; &gt; being able to play in all keys, I guess.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, narrow fifths are the price we pay for being able to get the<br/>&gt; thirds closer to just in the best triads.</p><p>Hmmm.  So the nature of the compromise in these tunings<br/>is that (unlike any EDO) some keys MUST be worse than<br/>others.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The major thirds<br/>&gt; &gt; in these chords, without exception, are a little wide to<br/>&gt; &gt; very wide, and I think this explains the worst of my<br/>&gt; &gt; difficulty with them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Still, the E-G# is only 400.26122,<br/>&gt; &gt; hardly different from the 12EDO third of 400 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt; I can&apos;t really explain why the E major triad on E4 sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; so wrong to me.  Is it the minor third of ~297 cents?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Probably.  (Those who think that the beating of minor 3rds aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; nearly as important as beating major 3rds should take note.)</p><p>&gt; Another possibility is that once you&apos;ve gotten &quot;spoiled&quot; hearing how<br/>&gt; nice the triads from Bb thru A sound, you&apos;re jarred by the relative<br/>&gt; dissonance of triads only slightly worse than 12-ET.  In my latest<br/>&gt; experimentation with WT&apos;s and TO&apos;s I&apos;ve listened and relistened (and<br/>&gt; compared and recompared) tunings with one another and have been<br/>&gt; occasionally surprised to find that I may experience different<br/>&gt; reactions at different times -- sometimes only a matter of 10 or 15<br/>&gt; minutes apart.</p><p>I noticed the same thing, but over much shorter time intervals, mostly<br/>when I was contrasting the effect of the two tunings (your extra-TO<br/>and 12-EDO) by playing a short phrase of perhaps two bars, first in<br/>one and then the other, then repeating both - in the pattern 1 2 1 2.</p><p>&gt; ...  At one time a Pythagorean triad may sound only<br/>&gt; marginally acceptable and at another time a triad with even more<br/>&gt; total absolute error than that (such as the worst ones in the<br/>&gt; temperament extraordinaire) will sound more acceptable.  Likewise,<br/>&gt; sometimes a low-contrast modern well-temperament (with a relatively<br/>&gt; small difference in intonation between the best and worst triads)<br/>&gt; will sound as if all the triads are very close to 12-ET (and<br/>&gt; therefore probably not worth the effort), whereas at other times the<br/>&gt; difference between the best and worst will seem quite effective.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There seems to be some sort of &quot;hearing fatigue&quot; in operation here,</p><p>Perhaps my even shorter-term &quot;hearing fatigue&quot; arose from the<br/>fact I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ... ? :-)  Yes, I thought much<br/>the same thing, so I took a rest break and came back to it.  The first<br/>time I repeated the fourfold pattern 1 2 1 2 as above, I still heard<br/>the representations of the first tuning differently.  So the effect I<br/>heard probably had more to do with the different contrasts, as<br/>follows:</p><p>  Tuning          1      2      1      2<br/>  Contrast     0-1   1-2  2-1  1-2</p><p>All of which makes me even more certain that I will never listen<br/>to an adaptive tuning without a distinct feeling of nausea!  (Slight<br/>OT: Is barbershop tuning necessarily adaptive?  It certainly sounds<br/>so to me.

I set two identical tracks to<br/>&gt; a long sustained note at MIDI-note 69 (A-440 Hz).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then, while keeping the pitch of Track 1 constant,<br/>&gt; and using the finest pitch-bend resolution in Cakewalk --<br/>&gt; the 12mu (dodekamu) level, 4096 steps per semitone<br/>&gt; -- i incremented the pitch-bend values of Track 2 until<br/>&gt; i heard the notes go out of phase, indicating that<br/>&gt; the pitch of Track 2 had changed minutely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On my old soundcard, the pitch change occurred each<br/>&gt; time i incremented the 12mu values by 64, which indicates<br/>&gt; that the soundcard was giving 6mu (hexamu) resolution,<br/>&gt; that is, 4096/64 = 64 steps per semitone, which equals<br/>&gt; 768-edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But on my new soundcard, the pitch change occurred at<br/>&gt; unequally-spaced intervals which incremented by either<br/>&gt; 40 or 41 (12mu) steps, or 80 or 81 steps, which means<br/>&gt; that each pitch-change &quot;zone&quot; is quantized to either<br/>&gt; 1 or 2 cents:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4096/40 or 4096/41 = ~1 cent<br/>&gt; 4096/80 or 4096/81 = ~2 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So in effect, what i get is a 768-tone subset of 1200-edo.</p><p>Thank you, that is quite clear.  So to test the MIDI<br/>frequency resolution of our sound sources (card or external<br/>MIDI source), using whatever MIDI software we have to<br/>hand, we could also try to find the smallest MIDI Pitch Bend<br/> that audibly changes the simplest timbre.  Obviously, only<br/>software with fine PB resolution would be useful in such an<br/>exercise.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The only thoughts I have on the matter are, that since<br/>&gt; &gt; the soundcard is a digital device, it necessarily DOES<br/>&gt; &gt; have a fixed resolution that will depend on the chip and<br/>&gt; &gt; logic design.  Thus, the manufacturer would probably be<br/>&gt; &gt; best able to advise you on the resolution they intended<br/>&gt; &gt; the card to have.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Without bothering to get any more scientific about it<br/>&gt; than i already have, i just think it&apos;s easiest and safest<br/>&gt; to assume that digital audio hardware is not going to<br/>&gt; give resolution better than 2 cents.</p><p>I don&apos;t know about that ...  I suspect the actual limits<br/>to the frequency resolution of digital audio hardware<br/>will be much better than that.  In practice, this will<br/>probably only matter in music with slow sustained sounds<br/>or very slow changes in pitch.

I tend to think making the major triad brats exact and<br/>letting the minor triad brats be a little bit off makes the most sense.</p><p>&gt; As to how close it comes to perfection, judge for yourself:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Major -----Beat Ratios-----<br/>&gt; Triad  M3/5th  m3/5th m3/M3<br/>&gt; ----- ------- ------- -----<br/>&gt; Ab... ------- -------  1.50<br/>&gt; Eb... ------- -------  1.50<br/>&gt; Bb... ------- -------  1.50<br/>&gt; F....    7.01   13.02  1.86<br/>&gt; C....    2.50    6.26  2.50<br/>&gt; G....    2.50    6.26  2.50<br/>&gt; D....    3.34    7.51  2.25<br/>&gt; A....    5.01   10.01  5.00<br/>&gt; E....    6.67   12.51  1.87<br/>&gt; B...   16.63   27.45  1.65<br/>&gt; F#... 1467.47 2203.71  1.50<br/>&gt; C#... 1084.06 1628.58  1.50</p><p>You didn&apos;t like Wendell&apos;s brats of 2, but I can&apos;t see this is an<br/>improvement. A 5/2 brat has a brat orbit of 5/2, -5/2, -4/25, which<br/>doesn&apos;t seem as good as 2. The 5 brat has an orbit 5, -5/7, -7/25, and<br/>I would urge you to dump it in favor of one or more brats of 4<br/>instead. I don&apos;t know where the 1.86 and 1.85 come from, but a brat<br/>of 13/7 has an orbit 13/7, -7, -1/13. 9/4 is another not very terrific<br/>looking brat, with an orbit of 9/4, -10/3, -2/15.</p><p>I recommend using as many of the &quot;magic&quot; brats as possible; load up on<br/>3/2 and 4, and fill in a gap with 2 or 3.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2005 9:54:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, 20 Oct 2005, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Paul,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; On Mon, 17 Oct 2005, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can&apos;t really explain why the E major triad on E4 sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so wrong to me.

Holding the Keyboard Scale button<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; down for two seconds changes the tuning mode to one in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; which you can adjust the tuning of each note name (octave<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent pitch class) independently by from -64 to +63<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; cents, in steps of 1 cent, away from 12-EDO.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s also possible to toggle between the altered tuning and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the standard 12-EDO tuning by tapping the Keyboard Scale<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; button.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;...

Monz did a test where he found that, for at least<br/>one<br/>&gt; &gt; synth model, the increments were not at all equal (in his case,<br/>some<br/>&gt; &gt; were one cent and some were two cents), even though nominally, if<br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt; trusted the manufacturer, they should have been. The same is most<br/>&gt; &gt; definitely true of another synth, my Ensoniq. Synth manufacturers<br/>&gt; &gt; have had very little market pressure to implement accurate<br/>&gt; &gt; microtuning offsets.

I tend to think making the major triad brats exact<br/>and<br/>&gt; letting the minor triad brats be a little bit off makes the most<br/>sense.</p><p>I agree, and that&apos;s exactly what I did with all of the other<br/>synchronous temperaments I worked on over the past couple of months.<br/>With this one there was actually a completely different reason for<br/>making both the major and minor brat ratios approximate: if the tones<br/>in a chain from Ab thru G# are pitched so that that brat ratios for<br/>major triads Ab thru E are exact then, G# is 0.01661 cents lower in<br/>pitch than Ab; widening all of the tempered fifths (spanning F thru<br/>G#) by 1/9 of that miniscule amount makes them the same pitch.<br/>(Hmmm, I just noticed that this improves some of the minor 3rd brat<br/>ratios but worsens others, but fortunately it&apos;s only a slight change -<br/>- oh, well!)</p><p>&gt; &gt; As to how close it comes to perfection, judge for yourself:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Major -----Beat Ratios-----<br/>&gt; &gt; Triad  M3/5th  m3/5th m3/M3<br/>&gt; &gt; ----- ------- ------- -----<br/>&gt; &gt; Ab... ------- -------  1.50<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb... ------- -------  1.50<br/>&gt; &gt; Bb... ------- -------  1.50<br/>&gt; &gt; F....    7.01   13.02  1.86<br/>&gt; &gt; C....    2.50    6.26  2.50<br/>&gt; &gt; G....    2.50    6.26  2.50<br/>&gt; &gt; D....    3.34    7.51  2.25<br/>&gt; &gt; A....    5.01   10.01  2.00 [corrected from 5.00]<br/>&gt; &gt; E....    6.67   12.51  1.87<br/>&gt; &gt; B...   16.63   27.45  1.65<br/>&gt; &gt; F#... 1467.47 2203.71  1.50<br/>&gt; &gt; C#... 1084.06 1628.58  1.50<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You didn&apos;t like Wendell&apos;s brats of 2, but I can&apos;t see this is an<br/>&gt; improvement.</p><p>Oh, I liked it okay, because I used it in my A major triad (note that<br/>I had the wrong figure in the 3rd column of the above table, which<br/>I&apos;ve now noted as corrected).</p><p>&gt; A 5/2 brat has a brat orbit of 5/2, -5/2, -4/25, which<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t seem as good as 2. The 5 brat has an orbit 5, -5/7, -7/25,<br/>and<br/>&gt; I would urge you to dump it in favor of one or more brats of 4<br/>&gt; instead.</p><p>My primary objective was to keep the total absolute error of the<br/>major triads for F, C, and G under 20 cents and Bb and D under 24<br/>cents (which is to say, 5 triads significantly better than 12-ET;<br/>Wendell has only 3).  I therefore selected brat ratios that would not<br/>only accomplish this, but also create a smooth change in intonation<br/>as one moves about the circle of fifths (whereas Wendell has all the<br/>major triads from D to B slightly worse than 12-ET).</p><p>In other words, my priorities were different.  Synchronized beating<br/>is a very subtle effect, and it requires considerable tuning<br/>precision.  The error of the individual intervals from just<br/>intonation is much more obvious, so I have selected brats that will<br/>produce a decent well-temperament.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know where the 1.86 and 1.85 come from, but a brat<br/>&gt; of 13/7 has an orbit 13/7, -7, -1/13.</p><p>The untweaked value for 1.86 is 1.85714285714..., or 13/7.</p><p>I didn&apos;t have 1.85 anywhere; did you mean 1.87?  Its untweaked value<br/>is 1.875.</p><p>&gt; 9/4 is another not very terrific<br/>&gt; looking brat, with an orbit of 9/4, -10/3, -2/15.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I recommend using as many of the &quot;magic&quot; brats as possible; load up<br/>on<br/>&gt; 3/2 and 4, and fill in a gap with 2 or 3.</p><p>Okay, I&apos;ll take another look at this. I just think that a lot of the<br/>minor 3rd brats won&apos;t be as simple as we would like.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2005 12:23:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dave Seidel &lt;dave@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; One combination I&apos;m interested in exploring (I understand others have<br/>&gt; already done stuff like this) is a combination of Csound and Keykit,<br/>&gt; where KeyKit streams MIDI to Csound for rendering.

The brat for 12-et is 1.7133, so a mixture of 1.5 and 2.0<br/>&gt; brats makes sense. The brats for 1.5 are 3/2, 0, infinity and their<br/>&gt; inverses, which is nice. The 2 brats are not so good, being 2, -5,<br/>&gt; -1/10 and their inverses. However, you need to go up to a brat of 4 to<br/>&gt; get something simpler, giving 4, -1, -1/4, and you then need to<br/>&gt; balance off the flatter fifths with either more pure fifths, or even<br/>&gt; fifths with brats less than 3/2. Wendell liked the sound of these brat<br/>&gt; 2 triads, and they represent the easiest way to tackle the problem.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In attempting to construct synchronous temperaments (with irrational<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals) with both proportional *major and minor* triads, I found<br/>&gt; &gt; that, unless the 5ths are exact, the minor-triad brats will at best<br/>&gt; &gt; only approximate simple ratios when the majors are exact (or vice<br/>&gt; &gt; versa), or you can compromise and make both inexact by about half and<br/>&gt; &gt; thereby get most of the brats to within 0.02 of simple numbers --<br/>&gt; &gt; close enough, I would say, considering that the required adjustment<br/>&gt; &gt; is very small.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s correct. I tend to think making the major triad brats exact and<br/>&gt; letting the minor triad brats be a little bit off makes the most sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As to how close it comes to perfection, judge for yourself:<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>[snipt]</p><p>I&apos;ve tried to follow this thread, but without much success.<br/>I see you both doing some maths to make the ratios of beats<br/>(&quot;brats&quot;) proportional - but still don&apos;t understand why.

In the following example, each of the tempered fifths<br/>  is modified by less than 0.002 cents (i.e., -3.9114 vs. -3.9132 cents<br/>  for an exact 2/11-comma narrow fifth).</p><p>  Here&apos;s a sneak preview of my 2/11-comma well-temperament (with beat<br/>  synchrony in virtually all 24 major &amp; minor triads).  Bear in mind<br/>  that this is an honest-to-goodness well-temperament that meets *all*<br/>  of Jorgensen&apos;s requirements, with key contrasts that are very similar<br/>  to the Valotti-Young (1/6-pythagorean-comma) temperament:</p><p>  ! secor_WT2-11.scl<br/>  !<br/>  George Secor&apos;s 2/11-comma well-temperament, proportional beating<br/>  12<br/>  !<br/>  92.13884<br/>  196.08721<br/>  296.01562<br/>  392.17442<br/>  499.92562<br/>  590.20835<br/>  698.04361<br/>  794.06062<br/>  894.13082<br/>  997.97062<br/>  1090.21803<br/>  2/1</p><p>  As to how close it comes to perfection, judge for yourself:</p><p>  Major -----Beat Ratios-----<br/>  Triad  M3/5th  m3/5th m3/M3<br/>  ----- ------- ------- -----<br/>  Ab... ------- -------  1.50<br/>  Eb... ------- -------  1.50<br/>  Bb... ------- -------  1.50<br/>  F....    7.01   13.02  1.86<br/>  C....    2.50    6.26  2.50<br/>  G....    2.50    6.26  2.50<br/>  D....    3.34    7.51  2.25<br/>  A....    5.01   10.01  5.00<br/>  E....    6.67   12.51  1.87<br/>  B&mldr;...   16.63   27.45  1.65<br/>  F#... 1467.47 2203.71  1.50<br/>  C#... 1084.06 1628.58  1.50</p><p>  Minor -----Beat Ratios-----<br/>  Triad  M3/5th  m3/5th m3/M3<br/>  ----- ------- ------- -----<br/>  Ab... ------- -------  1.00<br/>  Eb... ------- -------  1.00<br/>  Bb... ------- -------  1.00<br/>  F....   20.74   22.74  1.10<br/>  C....    7.99    9.99  1.25<br/>  G....    6.01    8.01  1.33<br/>  D....    4.02    6.02  1.50<br/>  A....    2.99    4.99  1.67<br/>  E....    2.99    4.99  1.67<br/>  B&mldr;...    7.93    9.93  1.25<br/>  F#...  950.96  952.96  1.00<br/>  C#...  933.34  935.34  1.00</p><p>  The F# and C# triads have 5ths that are nearly just, so you can<br/>  consider those 3- and 4-digit numbers as approaching infinity.

If those numbers were hertz we&apos;d have a 4 Hz beat<br/>between the lowest relevant harmonics in each of the three<br/>intervals.

If those numbers<br/>&gt; were hertz we&apos;d have a 4 Hz beat between the lowest relevant<br/>&gt; harmonics in each of the three intervals. And if it&apos;s tuned<br/>&gt; precisely enough those beats will be synchronised so there<br/>&gt; will be only one simple beat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This example results in narrowing of the fifth and major and<br/>&gt; minor thirds by approximately 4.5, 2.7 and 1.8 cents<br/>&gt; respectively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Compare this to 512 : 640-1/phi : 768-phi which should have no<br/>&gt; discernable beat synchrony but similar cent errors of<br/>&gt; approximately 3.7, 1.7 and 2.0 cents. phi = (sqrt(5)+1)/2</p><p>This is exactly the kind of comparison I&apos;ve been asking for<br/>the data to do...</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/6339">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/6339</a></p><p>I get...</p><p>766.38196601125010515179541316563<br/>639.38196601125010515179541316563<br/>512.0</p><p>...Hz. for the messy chord.

Anybody feel one<br/>&gt; &gt; sounds better than the other?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for doing this, Carl. I now think my earlier theory on<br/>&gt; beat rates is crap, as I would have realised if I&apos;d (before now)<br/>&gt; set up a spreadsheet to look at the waveforms and their<br/>&gt; envelopes, even without listening to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is a lot more to it. The waveform used for the single<br/>&gt; notes matters a lot (I used sawtooths, what did you use Carl?).</p><p>The least-jarring thing with decent harmonic content that<br/>I could coax out of Cool Edit.  Which turned out to be the<br/>&quot;inverse squared sine&quot; waveform, at, I believe, equal power<br/>and phase for all three notes, with short fades in and out<br/>added.</p><p>&gt; I think A has the 1:1:1 rates and B has those with no simple<br/>&gt; ratio.</p><p>That&apos;s right.</p><p>&gt; But I think B sound more restful. It simply sounds like<br/>&gt; it has slower beats (maybe 1.5 times slower) and a lower beat<br/>&gt; amplitude.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure about amplitude, but slower beat rate is the<br/>major difference to my ear.  Respondants so far included<br/>Magnus, Herman, Yahya, and yourself.  All preferred B for<br/>similar reasons.  But my wife prefers A.

Did you actually listen to the samples A, B, B1, B2? I was<br/>thinking mainly about the preference that almost everyone expressed,<br/>which turned out to be that the slower the beating of the 5th (though<br/>not going as far as absolute purity), the more pleasant the chord.</p><p>Perhaps, though, this was a function of overtone strengths: that the<br/>3rd harmonic was rather stronger than the 5th in the example - perhaps<br/>relatively stronger than in most acoustic instruments.</p><p>My idea was that some harpsichord makers might have intended the 5th<br/>harmonic stronger than the 3rd. NOT that they might have wanted to<br/>eliminate the beating of 5ths altogether (which would make the<br/>instrument untunable!). Taking the opinion &apos;X should be bigger than Y&apos;<br/>to a supposedly &apos;logical&apos; conclusion &apos;X should be enormous and Y<br/>should be nonexistent&apos; is a straw man. In 1/4 comma meantone, the<br/>beating 5ths are always going to be noticeable to some extent; the<br/>question is how to stop them *dominating* the aural picture (as they<br/>would if the 3rd harmonic was stronger).</p><p>Actually, my spinet has a rather strong 3rd harmonic, which makes it<br/>easy to tune, but some tempered fifths rather *obtrusive* to listen<br/>to. That&apos;s why I tend to prefer more nearly (12-)equal tunings on it.</p><p>In 1/4 comma meantone, the fifths beat really pretty quickly and in<br/>many cases in the &apos;intermittence&apos; range which psychoacoustically<br/>causes annoyance. I would want this sort of rapid beating to be almost<br/>submerged below other strong harmonics if the major chord is to be<br/>perceived as a consonance.</p><p>Besides, isn&apos;t it a strong consensus in the historical tuning industry<br/>that the size of the fifths in a circular temperament is of little<br/>consequence except insofar as they determine the size of thirds? How<br/>could this be true except if the beating of fifths was rather unobtrusive?</p><p>I&apos;ll let others deal with the &apos;deadness&apos; of pure intervals... and the<br/>position of the king and queen and how the strengths of harmonics can<br/>reverse themselves in travelling through the air (??).

And one needs<br/>to<br/>&gt; be able to set the start-phase of each harmonic independently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Consider the sync-beating 512:639:766 Hz chord. This will have the<br/>&gt; following beats between the following four pairs of partials.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4 Hz between 3rd harmonic of root and 2nd harmonic of fifth<br/>&gt; 8 Hz between 6th harmonic of root and 4th harmonic of fifth<br/>&gt; 4 Hz between 5th harmonic of root and 4th harmonic of major third<br/>&gt; 4 Hz between 6th harmonic of major third and 5th harmonic of fifth<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By carefully arranging the phases of the partials in the original<br/>&gt; timbre (sorry I&apos;m too lazy to work out the details) it should be<br/>&gt; possible to arrange for the three 4 Hz beats to be 120 degrees out<br/>of<br/>&gt; phase and thereby cancel each other and leave only the 8 Hz beat.</p><p>Again, your use of the word &quot;cancel&quot; here strikes be as totally<br/>incorrect. There is no cancellation because all the beats are just as<br/>audible whether they are in phase or out of phase.</p><p>&gt; This isn&apos;t terribly satisfactory since with equal amplitude<br/>partials<br/>&gt; that 8 Hz beat will still be quite obvious, so the next step is to<br/>&gt; look at a more normal timbre where the higher partials have lower<br/>&gt; amplitude.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this case it should be possible to make it so that the beats of<br/>the<br/>&gt; major and minor third intervals are in phase with each other and<br/>add<br/>&gt; to produce a beat which is the same amplitude as the 4 Hz beat in<br/>the<br/>&gt; fifth interval but 180 degrees out of phase with it, and thereby<br/>&gt; cancelling it.</p><p>Ditto. No cancellation would take place.</p><p>&gt; We still have the 8 Hz beat, but this time at lower<br/>&gt; amplitude.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one cheated and knocked out the 6th harmonic of the root and the<br/>&gt; 4th harmonic of the fifth completely, then one could have no<br/>beating<br/>&gt; at all in the triad (in the sense of loudness variation) even<br/>though<br/>&gt; every dyad heard alone has obvious beating.</p><p>Well, I&apos;m glad you agree at least about the latter.</p><p>(a) You haven&apos;t calculated loudness correctly.</p><p>(b) Have you listened to check if this supposed lack of loudness<br/>variation is actually audible as such?

To put it<br/>another<br/>&gt; way, in a close position chord *every* beat is a variation in<br/>timbre,<br/>&gt; since every beat affects the upper partials, not the fundamental.<br/>&gt; Beats could in principle only cancel each other out if they were all<br/>&gt; at the same pitch (as in a violin section all playing the &apos;same&apos;<br/>note).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~~~T~~~<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2005 2:45:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A single variable that correlates well with the preferences<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; majority here is simply the _error_in_the_fifth_.

Essentially, you can&apos;t get rid of the beats in B5 but you can<br/>get rid of the beats in B6 by removing 1920Hz which is the common overtone<br/>of the major third. This is done by adjusting the phase of either G4 or B4<br/>in such a way that the harmonic B6 vanishes and only the inharmonic B6<br/>remains. This may explain another reason for promoting quarter-comma<br/>(eventually third-comma) meantone.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2005 10:00:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Yes, or schismic or helmholtz or any other name that its been<br/>&gt; given over the years.

Thought you<br/>might<br/>&gt; have some thoughts on this as a possibility.</p><p>Hi Kraig,</p><p>I am in complete agreement with you on this point, so much so, in<br/>fact, that for the past few years I have made it a general practice<br/>in my tuning spreadsheets to express the numbers of ratios as the<br/>calculated products of their factors whenever it&apos;s meaningful to do<br/>so.</p><p>&gt;  I have BTW quite liked many of these scales you have come up along<br/>&gt; these lines and look forward to trying this one out in the future<br/>when i<br/>&gt; have a little less on my table.</p><p>OOPS!  Please disregard this latest one!!!  Although the paint&apos;s not<br/>dry yet, I&apos;ve already come to the conclusion that I can do better<br/>(and expect that I&apos;ll eventually replace my 1/7-comma and 2/11-comma<br/>well-temperaments with something else).</p><p>BTW, getting back to factoring ratios, I hope you won&apos;t try to factor<br/>the ones with the largest numbers in the following one:</p><p>&gt; &gt; !
