Does it refer to sruti or temperament?</p><p>----------</p><p>All is in definitions!</p><p>Either we share the same sruti definition and then you have simply to count<br/>or else we have distinct definitions and then we have to compare them.</p><p>Why are you astonished that two distinct tones may have a same count of<br/>srutis while it seems you would not be if they would have a same count of<br/>steps?</p><p>----------</p><p>If you would share my sruti definition, then you would rattach, at any<br/>system having &lt;21/20 16/15 15/14 10/9&gt; as steps, this set</p><p>   &lt;21/20 64/63 225/224 28/27&gt;</p><p>as unique possibility for srutis. In that case, it would remain only to<br/>count :</p><p>   10/9 = (21/20) (64/63) (225/224) (28/27)</p><p>             1       2        3        4</p><p>    9/8 = (21/20) (64/63) (225/224) (21/20)</p><p>----------</p><p>Since you seem to see a problem in that equality and the count 24 for the<br/>octave, you have to give first to me your sruti definition (if it is not<br/>something varying from case to case according to contextual fudge factors).</p><p>What can I say without that? It could maybe permit to see why I distinguish<br/>macrotonality from microtonality.</p><p>----------</p><p>Now I give to you my sruti definition.</p><p>It is not derived from matrices using. It is only 7 years after I defined<br/>them I found that srutis are easily manipulated by matrices : what might<br/>talk about its consistency level.</p><p>I used already since many years a Turbo Pascal program finding structures<br/>like gammoids and gammiers when I discover, in one of seldom visit at music<br/>library of Laval University, the Donald Lentz Hindu Classical System book.<br/>I saw immediately how this system would be a great illustration of the<br/>gammier theory.</p><p>Using my program I found in few minutes the near corresponding harmonic<br/>generator and in few hours the explanation of all anomalies shown by Donald<br/>Lentz. It is there, about this problem, I defined srutis.</p><p>What I mean here by defining srutis? The srutis had already a rich<br/>polysemic sense in Hindu music. I mean I distinguished in sruti concept<br/>between a universal aspect, that may be applied to all gammoids, and<br/>particular aspect, that might be applied to only few gammoids sharing a<br/>specific property existing in the Hindu Classical system.</p><p>In that Hindu system we find something very specific : the interval between<br/>the maximal tone of a degree (SA RI GA ...) and the minimal tone of the<br/>next degree is always the minimal step (256/243). There is no exception in<br/>the Hindi region where the sruti 12 is 729/512 but one exception where the<br/>sruti 12 is 64/45.</p><p>If a similar particularity is included in a sruti definition then you<br/>cannot have a universal algebraic tool. However I have not invented a new<br/>concept. I took simply what was universal while already there in Hindu system.</p><p>---</p><p>In the Hindu Classical system the first degree has four tones being in order</p><p>   &lt;256/243 16/15 10/9 9/8&gt;</p><p>Do you know their Hindu names? I translate only :</p><p>   &lt;one-sruti two-srutis three-srutis four-srutis&gt;</p><p>So one of the srutis, in the precise sense of increments, is forcely the<br/>minimal step 256/243 for starting with unison 1</p><p>   one-sruti = (zero-sruti)(sruti increment)<br/>     256/243 =          (1)(256/243)</p><p>Since 16/15 is two-srutis (meaning composed of 2 srutis) another sruti<br/>increment is forcely 81/80 for</p><p>   two-srutis = (one-sruti)(sruti increment)<br/>        16/15 =   (256/243)(81/80)</p><p>Continuing, since 10/9 is three-srutis (meaning composed of 3 srutis)<br/>another sruti increment is forcely 25/24 for</p><p>   three-srutis = (two-srutis)(sruti increment)<br/>           10/9 =      (16/15)(25/24)</p><p>Finally since 9/8 is four-srutis (meaning composed of 4 srutis) the next<br/>increment is forcely the sruti already used 81/80 for</p><p>   four-srutis = (three-srutis)(sruti increment)<br/>           9/8 =         (10/9)(81/80)</p><p>That gives the three srutis</p><p>   &lt;256/243 81/80 25/24&gt;</p><p>having in cents approximately</p><p>   [90 22 70]</p><p>permitting to obtain the very particular 22-tone Hindu system with the<br/>particular sequence of these well-defined three increments</p><p>   (90 22 70 22)(90 22 70 22)(90 22 70 22)(90)(90 22 70 22)(90 22 70 22)(90)</p><p>That construction is very particular but the manner we have obtained the<br/>three sruti increments is not only universal but very useful in musical<br/>system algebra.</p><p>It is exactly that definition I wrote recently in condensed manner</p><p>   sB = e&apos;(tG)</p><p>where</p><p>   the tonal generator tG means the steps (degree 1) and</p><p>   the srutal basis sB means the srutis</p><p>and where as seen, the srutis are composed of the minimal step and the<br/>unison vectors necessary to construct the steps starting with the minimal.</p><p>----------</p><p>Maybe there exist another definition having its proper virtues. I need to<br/>know it if I have to say something new.</p><p>Pierre</p></div>
