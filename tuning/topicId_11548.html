I don&apos;t propose sonance definition as<br/>a measure in practical context. If 30001:20000 &quot;is&quot; very consonant, it&apos;s<br/>clearly because 30001:20000 &quot;is perceived&quot; as 3:2 ratio. Rationality of<br/>sonance, or rationality of width, are a matter of brain. 30001:20000 exists<br/>in (abstract) space of acoustical measured values, but don&apos;t exist in brain<br/>as category for sonance apprehension.</p><p>I&apos;ve wanted to distinct partial order accessible by perception of total<br/>possible orders to dissipate bunch of &quot;malentendus&quot; on historical<br/>discussions about order of consonant tones. There is no total order of<br/>sonance in music like quasi-total perceived order of width. What I expect<br/>from a global sonance definition (compatible with perception) has been well<br/>expicited: only perfect congruence and fruitfullness.

Context is purely mathematical.</p><p>You wrote (on partial and total orders)</p><p>&lt;&lt; Could you please explain these concepts, with examples if possible? &gt;&gt;</p><p>There is a total order on a set of elements if, for all pairs (a,b), we can<br/>write a &lt;= b or (non-exclusive) a &gt;= b. Order is partial if the relation is<br/>defined for only a subset of all pairs.</p><p>For example, I can translate and develop what I have soon written privately<br/>in french. We can construct three total distinct orders on all pairs of<br/>rationals in using criteria (ab) or (a+b) or max(a,b) for reduced ratio a/b<br/>in comparaison relation. With criteria</p><p>      (ab)    7/2 &lt; 3/5  for (7x2) &lt; (3X5)<br/>     (a+b)    7/2 &gt; 3/5  for (7+2) &gt; (3+5)<br/>  max(a,b)    7/2 &gt; 3/5  for (7) &gt; (5)</p><p>All rationals are completly ordered by one or other of these criteria. Two<br/>ratios can be equal but all ratios are comparable. These total orders are<br/>very different. Comparing 7/2, 3/5 et 7/1, we have (14)(15)(7) for (ab),<br/>(9)(8)(8) for (a+b) and (7)(5)(7) for max(a,b).</p><p>But partial order of adjacent ratios in Stern-Brocot tree is compatible<br/>with the three total orders defined.
