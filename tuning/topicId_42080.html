The tuning matters because this landmark of microtonal<br/>experimentation represents one of Harrison&apos;s most successful responses to<br/>Partch&apos;s pioneering theories. (Burman-Hall and Bill Slye&apos;s informative CD<br/>liner notes provide a fuller explanation of these tuning issues.) Despite<br/>the temperamental experimentation, and a freewheeling structure that<br/>eschews barlines, the music (written for a never-realized puppet production<br/>of the classic French play) is a deeply affecting evocation of both the<br/>ancient Rome of the script and the 17th-century Paris of the playwright. As<br/>with so much of this composer&apos;s work, Cinna manages to be at once radically<br/>progressive and strikingly beautiful. It&apos;s spellbinding music like this<br/>that makes Lou Harrison one of the great composers of the 20th century.&quot;</p><p>Look at what we see:</p><p>&quot;The tuning matters...&quot;<br/>&quot;...liner notes provide a fuller explanation of these tuning issues.&quot;<br/>&quot;successful responses to Partch&apos;s pioneering theories.&quot;</p><p>But most important are the last two sentences: progressive, beautiful,<br/>spellbinding, and composorial accolades for the last century. If anyone<br/>wants to take up a challenge to the ruling tuning, they might note that it<br/>wasn&apos;t papers, opinions, diagrams, or experiments on display. Those<br/>activities might prime the pump, but music, and only music, will win the<br/>day. And night.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; <a href="mailto:jonszanto@yahoo.com">jonszanto@yahoo.com</a></p></div>
