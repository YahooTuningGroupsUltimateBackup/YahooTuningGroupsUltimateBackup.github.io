Good points. I think we can generalize with a fair<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; degree of safety (cringing defensively) that the octave is the most<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; critical interval in terms of human tolerance for tuning error, the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perfect fifth next, etc., right on up the harmonic series, but<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eliminating factors of two.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Bob, It&apos;s lucky you cringed defensively. :-)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I feel that what you say holds until the complexity a*b of a ratio  a:b</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (in lowest terms) gets up around 35. Then I think tolerance for<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mistuning (e.g. in cents) starts to decrease again, but for an<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entirely different reason. A complex ratio doesn&apos;t become much more<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dissonant with mistuning like a simple ratio does, since it is already<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fairly dissonant, but it loses its justness, or its identity _as_ that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ratio, with a smaller mistuning the more complex the ratio, until<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finally up around a complexity of 100 to 120 (depending on the timbre<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and lots of other things) it _has_ no identity distinct from its<br/>&sup2;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nearby mistunings and its justness cannot be found.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The above assumes we&apos;re talking about bare dyads. If the more complex<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ratios are embedded in larger otonal chords then I think the tolerance<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stays about the same as we keep going up.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just my humble opinion.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; i think dave keenan is exactly right. there&apos;s no substitute for<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; actually *listening* to lots of just and mistuned ratios, and dave<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; has obviously done a great deal of this.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ***This is terribly interesting, but I&apos;m only *half* getting it.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Bob Wendell is saying that the tolerance for error increases as we go<br/>&gt;&gt; further up the harmonic series. Dave Keenan says this is true,  but<br/>&gt;&gt; after a certain a*b (num*denom) then again we need to be more<br/>&gt;&gt; sensitive to error again, yes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;right, between a*b=35 and a*b=100, or higher.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; But the reasoning is the &quot;justness&quot; of the larger ratio which becomes<br/>&gt;&gt; rather an &quot;academic&quot; distinction, yes, since we&apos;re in the realm<br/>&gt;&gt; of &quot;rational&quot; intonation rather than truly &quot;just&quot; intonation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;no, that comes in with even more complex ratios.</p><p>Hello, I am just an amateur musician interrested in physics of music.</p><p>Back to the basic:</p><p>When a fifth (3/2F0) is out of tune of dF with a fundamental (F0), the<br/>beating harmonics are around 3F0, 6F0 and so on, with corresponding beat<br/>frequencies of 3*dF, 6*dF etc.</p><p>When a major third (5/4F0) is out of tune, the beating harmonics<br/>are around, 5F0, 10F0 and so on with corresponding beat<br/>frequencies of 5*dF, 10*dF etc.</p><p>When a minor third (6/5F0) is out of tune, the beating harmonics<br/>are around, 6F0, 12F0 and so on with corresponding beat frequencies<br/>of 6*dF, 10*dF etc.</p><p>So, for a given mistuning value of dF, the first beat if faster for<br/>minor third than for major third and faster for major third than for<br/>a fifth. Thats for the hard facts. But how annoying it sound depends<br/>of other (partly subjective) factors.</p><p>For most acoustic sources, there is an overall enveloppe damping<br/>that is typically between 3 and 6 dB per octave. So typically,for<br/>a given value of dF the beating frequency of the third shall be faster,<br/>but also less intense (from -6 to -12dB) than the beating of the fifth.<br/>The accoustic damping may compensate partly for the increase of speed.<br/> This compensation is more important for instrument with great damping<br/>(such as modern grand piano) than for instrument like harpsichord<br/>having a a flatter spectrum with much more intense high wavenumber<br/>harmonics.</p><p>In my opinion that may explain why ET is much more tolerable on a<br/>piano that on an harpsichord.</p><p>Further, there is a threshold in frequency beyond which a beat is<br/>not perceived as a beat but as a &quot;roughness&quot;. Figures: 4Hz out of<br/>tune for A4 at 440 Hz represents around 15 cents (this is approximately<br/>how much out of tune is ET thirds). This gives a 4*5=20 (maj. 3rd)<br/>or 4*6=24 (min.third) beats per second for a third; quite rough but<br/>for a fifth that whould give an annoying (nearly intolerable) 12 beats<br/>with an even greater intensity.</p><p>For ratio between greater numbers (let say 17/19), the beating harmonics<br/>are farther away from the fondamental, much more rapid, less intense<br/>and thus less likely to be perceived. Further, most ears are not used<br/>to the smooth sound of a just 17/19 :-).</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p></div>
