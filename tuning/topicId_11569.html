Kind of like the Godowsky example that came up a few<br/>days ago (&quot;Java Suite&quot;), I think that a given musics tuning is not one<br/>of the more dominant conveyers of a given musics style, or rather<br/>overall impact. (Note that this is different from a dominant or<br/>prominent shaper of music.) This is probably not going to be a popular<br/>view here at the tuning list, but it has been my experience.</p><p>&gt; It would be great if there was some software that could achieve this<br/>kind of analysis of a midi file, by allowing you to input the<br/>intervals of the tuning that was used, then be able to look inside of<br/>the moment-to-moment choices that a 12 tET improviser made during a<br/>first exposure to the tuning - and be able to quantify the choices.<br/>Two things it might reveal are the deficits of 12 tET and the<br/>strengths of the tuning used - providing intuitive information based<br/>on improvisation.</p><p>I don&apos;t really see how this sort of a first exposure approach could<br/>really tell much more than some very basic (and most likely trivial)<br/>things about the particular improviser and the particular tuning. I<br/>would tend to think the &apos;magic&apos; and the &apos;secrets&apos; come from a body of<br/>committed music (be it improvised or composed or whatever).</p><p>&gt; Perhaps a &quot;12 Tetter&quot; would gravitate to things that are better than<br/>what they are used to.</p><p>Perhaps, but as you said earlier, (and I agree) &quot;it&apos;s way too<br/>subjective of a thing to ever be universally quantified.&quot;</p><p>Dan</p></div>
