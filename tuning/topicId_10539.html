(obviously, diamond marimba, etc.)</p><p>&gt; many arrangements that simply reshuffle 12-tET pitches. For<br/>&gt; example, since you enjoy the effect of a 6-tone scale, with &quot;tritones&quot;<br/>&gt; sounding like &quot;octaves&quot;, you could explore all kinds of 6-tone scales found<br/>&gt; within 12-tET</p><p>I see what you&apos;re saying... I could basically map ANY 12-tET pitches to<br/>the first 6 notes...</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m surprised that my paper is so unclear to you. Is it that poorly written?<br/>&gt; In any case, the idea is that 22-tone equal temperament is mapped to the<br/>&gt; keyboard one note at a time ascending, except that the key &quot;B&quot; is skipped<br/>&gt; over. The obvious result is that two keyboard octaves sounds like a regular<br/>&gt; &quot;octave&quot;,</p><p>I&apos;m getting the two &quot;Es&quot; as not being mapped... at least when I use the<br/>two22.kbm mapping file from Scala</p><p>Whoops... I just see another one Erl22.kbm... maybe that&apos;s the alternate<br/>I&apos;m looking for...</p><p>__________ ____ ___ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
