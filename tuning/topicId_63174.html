Last<br/>night, I had some kind of weird dream in which I had discovered some<br/>scales for someone using LOG MOD arithmetic.  Maybe it was<br/>determining frequencies... dunno.  Was Monzo ever discussing LOGs in<br/>conjunction with MODulus arithmetic in determining scales?  I was<br/>very positive in my dream-like state that I knew absolutely what this<br/>was all about.</p><p>This is, essentially, a symptom of too much Tuning List cold turkey,<br/>and a bad time of year for it, at that...</p><p>On the other hand, in addition to my usual lunacy and composing, I<br/>did manage to read 5 (well, actually 4.5... since I&apos;m not done) books<br/>by the venerable Nicolas Slonimsky who, despite his &quot;perfect pitch,&quot;<br/>was frequently very positive toward microtonality, especially just<br/>intonation.  Such thoughts run through many of his writings.</p><p>But, Slonimsky, besides being a &quot;new music person&quot; extraordinare, was<br/>also quite an iconoclast, which led to his friendship and association<br/>with Frank Zappa.  They actually got along quite well, partially<br/>through their mutual enthusiasm for the music of Edgar Varese.</p><p>In any case, I had the good fortune to have the opportunity to<br/>interview Slonimsky&apos;s daughter Electra, and the audio interview is<br/>now on the Internet here:</p><p><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pagemusic.cfm?bandID=446488">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/pagemusic.cfm?bandID=446488</a></p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/2005 7:27:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I really am anxious to get back to the Tuning List again.

Yes, I have<br/>gone through this, maybe with a little assistance here and there.  I<br/>don&apos;t even think it was really all that complicated... So, that&apos;s<br/>what I was remembering!  Amazing what&apos;s actually lurking in the<br/>recesses of the mind... I&apos;m anxious to get back here, after I finish<br/>my Slonimsky phase, since there is much to do.  Szanto has found some<br/>great composing tools so I may be back in my &quot;candy store&quot; approach<br/>of explorations, and can start all over again!  (Not forgetting, of<br/>course, the beautiful *Blackjack* for practical instrumental<br/>composition...)</p><p>JP</p></div>
