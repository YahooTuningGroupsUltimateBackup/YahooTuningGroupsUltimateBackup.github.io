One obvious example is the<br/>recent success of Moby&apos;s album &apos;Play&apos;. Almost all the songs relied heavily<br/>on samples of field recordings made by  Alan Lomax  of a capella singing by<br/>blues singers. These recordings unmistakenly contained 7 limit just<br/>intonation harmonies and melodies. So obviously people respond to music<br/>with unfamiliar harmonies.</p><p>One observation I have made is that to actually make popular music the most<br/>important thing is to have words, lyrics, singing. Instrumental music of<br/>any kind [with one important exception] has not been popular since people<br/>stopped dancing to jazz. And there is another point, people generally want<br/>to have some physical involvement with music. This is the crux of  Partch&apos;s<br/>corporeal manifesto that everyone seems to have ignored or<br/>forgotton.&apos;Genesis of A Music&apos; was not just a book about  microtones or<br/>extended just intonation but the biggest thread was a tirade against<br/>abstract music.</p><p>And what kind of music are most of the microtonalists creating ?<br/>Answer-abstrct music.</p><p>Put simply abstract music is not popular. Songs and music people can dance<br/>to are popular.</p><p>This music need not be bland and mediocre but if it is in Just Intonation<br/>it should not sound &apos;out of tune&apos; [Dave Keenan made this excellent point].<br/>The problem with art music is that techniques and form are the ends not the<br/>means to an end. For me the goal of  music is communication of ideas<br/>wrapped up in emotions.</p><p>Music does not in itself convey ideas or at least not very specific ideas.<br/>Words do convey specific ideas.  Music accompanying lyrics can colour and<br/>add a general emotional feeling, perception or  value to ideas contained in<br/>songs.</p><p>The other big one is dance. If music does not  make human limbs and torsos<br/>want move in a rhythmic way it only succeeds in conveying a general emotion<br/>or if words are included ideas will however be communicated.</p><p>Most microtonal music I have heard fails on almost all these counts, And<br/>could never be popular unless some consideration were given to these ideas.</p><p>The lyrics in songs needn&apos;t be banal or stupid. Tom Waits who has written<br/>some of the best lyrics since Captain Beefheart has had commercial success<br/>with his last album &apos;Mule Variations&apos;   which was 1 on the American album<br/>charts for quite a while.</p><p>Anyway with some care anyone on this list could come up with something that<br/>was commercially popular yet still had intellectual interest.</p><p>But please when you send off your demo to a record company don&apos;t talk about<br/>what tuning your track is in ! They won&apos;t care but if it sounds good they<br/>will know.</p><p>Justin White</p><p>DAVID JONES LIMITED      ACN 000 074 573</p><p>This email and any attachments are confidential and are intended solely for<br/>the recipient.
