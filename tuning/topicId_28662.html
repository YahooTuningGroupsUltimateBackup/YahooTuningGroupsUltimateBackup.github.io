I enjoy<br/>playing jazz in 19 eq, and I can imagine playing it in just about any<br/>tuning...although it might not sound like &quot;Misty.&quot; In fact, jazz is a<br/>real young art form, and I would imagine there&apos;s a lot of interesting<br/>things yet to be done with it...aren&apos;t there?<br/>    And as for blues (yet another young form, as is all American music,<br/>really, excepting the music of the folks who were here to greet the<br/>white guys), I always get a kick out of seeing folks try to analyze it<br/>in terms of ratios. In my 35 years of playing and studying blues, I have<br/>yet to see one of the Maestros of the form ever analyze what they do in<br/>terms of ratios...they just do it. At it&apos;s most basic and deepest, blues<br/>is a REALLY non-intellectual form; it comes from the heart and soul<br/>first (and Mike Bloomfield did occasionally mention microtones...but,<br/>never from a math viewpoint).<br/>Sure, it&apos;s ok with me to see folks chat about blues in a math<br/>context...but, fact is, if you listen to the guys who really bend them<br/>strings, like Albert King, Hendrix, Roy Buchanan, and many others,<br/>they&apos;re really all over the place, pitchwise. Albert had a limited<br/>repertoire of licks; but, within his framework, he really had a lot of<br/>tonal subtleties happening; he always had a little twist to his bends,<br/>and they always sounded fresh. He would put the string in different<br/>places, depending on the feeling he was after. Yeah, maybe those places<br/>can be related to ratios; but, the feeling came first.<br/>Also, of course, there&apos;s lots of regional styles of blues, some more<br/>microtonal than others...blues is pretty diverse, to be sure, and most<br/>folks don&apos;t play more than one style. Blues, too, is wide open to<br/>innovation...I&apos;ve found, again, that 19 eq lets one enter new realms of<br/>expression, both in composition and improvisation, in this style...try<br/>it, you&apos;ll like it...and do keep up the challenging posts...Hstick</p></div><h3>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>9/27/2001 9:56:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I agree wholeheartedly that the feeling and musical intuition come<br/>first. The origin of these delicious blues sounds was certainly not<br/>mathematical intellection!!! However, just as in any music, there are<br/>those who do it well, and those who don&apos;t. I notice some white blues<br/>singers stick to 12-tET tunings when they sing, and by and large the<br/>old Mississippi and Memphis, etc. black folk artists and certainly<br/>most black gospel blue runs definitely DO NOT.</p><p>I much prefer the latter! But even among blacks, there are those who<br/>tune consistently and well and those who don&apos;t, and the ones that<br/>tune well are gerneally the same ones who are also more musically<br/>expressive. Funny, huh? Just like musicians in other traditions!</p><p>My ear was able to imitate the black intervals from when I was &quot;knee<br/>high to a toad frog&quot;, and I knew nothing of JI then, I assure you!<br/>However, I find it fun to appreciate in terms of JI what the<br/>intuition has led us to do in practice. It deosn&apos;t hurt a thing and<br/>it even liberates keyboard players to experiement in ways that only<br/>vocalists and guitarists could before.</p><p>And what about something like experimenting with quasi-renaissance<br/>polyphony on blues scales that are tuned accurately to what the best<br/>in the authentic blues traditions have done? A good football player<br/>can throw a good pass without knowing anything about the mathematics<br/>of ballistics, but then he couldn&apos;t design anything that would<br/>imitate that action accurately, could he?</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;     The Catler Brothers &quot;Crash Landing&quot; CD is pretty good JI<br/>&gt; jazz...sounds fine.
