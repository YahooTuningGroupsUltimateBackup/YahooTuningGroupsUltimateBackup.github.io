Zarlino and others took the syntonic diatonic<br/>division of the tetrachord or fourth by Ptolemy, 9:8 10:9 16:15, as<br/>the basis for this system of intonation, which from a Renaissance<br/>standpoint had the advantage of providing pure major and minor thirds<br/>at 5:4 and 6:5 -- now the most favored consonances.</p><p>However, if we take anything smaller than 16:15 (or the 100 cents of<br/>12-tet) as a &quot;microtonal&quot; interval, then conventional medieval<br/>European music in 3-limit JI (Pythagorean tuning) is &quot;microtonal,&quot;<br/>since it uses a diatonic semitone of 256:243, about 90.224 cents.</p><p>Further, by this &quot;smaller than 16:15 or than 100 cents&quot; definition,<br/>any Renaissance piece using direct chromatic semitones (e.g. G-G#)<br/>would be &quot;microtonal,&quot; since the 5-limit chromatic semitone is 25:24,<br/>~70.67 cents, while the same interval in 1/4-comma meantone is about<br/>76.05 cents.</p><p>If we assume that a &quot;microtonal&quot; interval should be somewhat smaller<br/>than a usual diatonic or chromatic semitone in the most common<br/>European historical tunings, then the exact place to draw the line<br/>remains unclear, although I would draw it on the narrow side of 25:24.</p><p>For example, I am not sure whether I would describe Guillaume<br/>Costeley&apos;s 1/3-tone interval of 1/19 octave (~63.16 cents), or almost<br/>exactly 28:27 (~62.96 cents), as a &quot;microtone&quot; or simply as a &quot;very<br/>narrow semitone.&quot; Anything narrower than this I would consider a<br/>&quot;microtone.&quot;</p><p>&gt; though some would disagree with including quartertone music as being<br/>&gt; microtonal arguing that quartertone music is just an extension of<br/>&gt; 12tET resources.</p><p>To those asserting such an opinion, I might reply that 1/24 octave<br/>should be considered a &quot;microtone&quot; if it is noticeably narrower than a<br/>usual semitone, regardless of whether it is related to 12-tet, n-limit<br/>JI, or some other tuning system. In challenging the uniquely<br/>privileged position of 12-tet, I can at the same time respect it as<br/>_one_ valid alternative in an open universe of tunings.</p><p>Since 24-tet is a very popular microtonal system for 20th-century<br/>composed music, I would want to recognize it rather than exclude it<br/>from a definition of &quot;microtonality.&quot;</p><p>Incidentally, I wonder if &quot;direct microtonality&quot; might be a useful<br/>term for the melodic use of &quot;microtonal&quot; intervals of the kind we are<br/>discussing here. Other kinds of music may engage in what I might call<br/>&quot;microtonal distinctions&quot; without necessarily using direct<br/>microtonality:</p><p>(1) Medieval or Renaissance music realized in an extended tuning<br/>system such as 3-limit JI or meantone may involve microtonal<br/>distinctions between such notes as G# and Ab, the former note being a<br/>Pythagorean comma (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents) higher in 3-limit, and<br/>a diesis (128:125, ~41.06 cents) lower in 5-limit JI or 1/4-comma<br/>meantone. If these notes are both used in the same piece, but are not<br/>directly juxtaposed, then we have a microtonal distinction without<br/>direct microtonality.</p><p>(2) Certain tuning systems, for example a 12-note version of 3-limit<br/>JI popular in the early 15th century with a chain of fifths Gb-B, may<br/>involve microtonally distinct &quot;flavors&quot; of the same basic vertical<br/>interval, for example a contrast in this case between major thirds at<br/>the usual 81:64 (~407.82 cents) and 3-limit diminished fourths at<br/>8192:6561 (~384.36 cents, a Pythagorean comma smaller, and very close<br/>to 5:4). Likewise, the well-temperaments of the late 17th-19th<br/>centuries involve contrasting sizes of perfect fifths and thirds.</p><p>(3) Some tuning systems may also engage in microtonal adjustments of<br/>certain notes for the sake of just intonation: for example,<br/>Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI tunings on his archicembalo, where certain<br/>notes are apparently shifted by about 1/4 syntonic comma (~5.38 cents)<br/>in order to permit the tuning of certain sonorities with pure 3:2<br/>fifths and 6:5 minor thirds as well as 5:4 major thirds.</p><p>Thus one might say, for example, that early 15th-century keyboard<br/>music in a Gb-B 3-limit tuning or Bach&apos;s keyboard music in a period<br/>well-temperament indeed makes use of &quot;microtonal nuances,&quot; although it<br/>does not involve &quot;direct microtonality&quot; of the kind found in<br/>Vicentino&apos;s enharmonic music or 20th-century compositions in 24-tet,<br/>not to mention many world musics using smaller direct intervals than a<br/>semitone.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
