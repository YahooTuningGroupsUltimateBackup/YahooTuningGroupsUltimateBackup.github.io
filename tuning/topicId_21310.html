Of<br/>course, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s an issue that can ever be proven, in a<br/>scientific way, but it&apos;s interesting to reflect on. For example,<br/>although I understand that Schoenberg&apos;s atonal breakthroughs are<br/>important in the development of Western music, most of the music I&apos;ve<br/>heard in that system doesn&apos;t do anything for me in a positive way...it<br/>doesn&apos;t touch me on those real deep emotional, spiritual levels that,<br/>say, Bach (and many others) does. In fact, I&apos;ve tried to listen to<br/>Arnie&apos;s Violin Concerto over the years, and it&apos;s like a body without<br/>blood...it&apos;s cold, remote, and lifeless. Yet, again, I know<br/>intellectually that it&apos;s &quot;important...&quot; but, I don&apos;t enjoy listening to<br/>it. So, it isn&apos;t important to me in a total way...only on the<br/>intellectual side. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of Partch&apos;s music,<br/>either...I understand that his theories, his writings, and his<br/>instrument construction were/are significant milestones in Western<br/>music...yet, his music doesn&apos;t grab me down deep in any way. Thus, on a<br/>spiritual/emotional level, his music is not important to me at all,<br/>except as a demonstration of his theories...I admit I am somewhat amazed<br/>at the amount of passion his music arouses in some circles. But, that&apos;s<br/>ok...it&apos;s what makes life interesting, to be sure.<br/>    To me, important art is that which speaks to us on many levels at<br/>once...the human, the spiritual, the creative, the deepest emotional<br/>places, that which unites our humanity, in it&apos;s totality, with the<br/>eternal, the unknowable, the awesomeness of being in this remarkable<br/>Universe, knowing that we will soon pass on to...who knows?<br/>And, I know that these are rather personal concepts, perceived by each<br/>person in their own way, so perhaps these areas are not as easy to write<br/>about as factual ideas, math and science...yet, these are the areas I<br/>wish more folks on this forum would chat about. Sometimes, I feel this<br/>list is just a bit dry...I&apos;d like to hear more about what you all feel<br/>about music/art/life, what moves you, what doesn&apos;t. That&apos;s why I do<br/>enjoy it when folks get a bit passionate, and let their inner selves<br/>come out...that&apos;s what&apos;s really interesting to me. Sam Phillips (Sun<br/>records) said something about Howlin Wolf once that really touched<br/>me...&quot;This is where the soul of man never dies.&quot; And, 12 eq or 31st root<br/>of 17, if music has that quality, then that&apos;s what makes it &quot;important&quot;<br/>to me...Hstick</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>4/20/2001 10:13:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil,</p><p>It&apos;s funny that you wrote today, about music as it affects, because I<br/>just yesterday had gotten an email from a person who knew Partch in<br/>the very last year(s) of his life. It made me think of you<br/>immediately:</p><p>&quot;...i can&apos;t even breath or talk or listen to nature now without<br/>hearing the music in such phenomena i once percieved as sound, thanks<br/>to what Harry showed me!!! without a doubt, Harry Partch &amp; Jimi<br/>Hendrix were the two greatest influences upon my musical &quot;microtonal&quot;<br/>perceptions... after their deaths, i was lost emotionally...&quot;</p><p>Which only goes to show that everyone is so different. I know that<br/>you&apos;ve shared how much Hendrix meant to you, but apparently Partch<br/>doesn&apos;t do it.

So, it isn&apos;t important to me in a total way...only on the<br/>&gt;intellectual side.<br/>Now, on that one I happen to agree, if only because, as with other music<br/>that I find unaffecting, it simply doesn&apos;t connect with any other sensation<br/>patterns I&apos;ve stored up. I suppose that if I listened to it enough times<br/>and in enough situations that involved, say, great weather, good food, good<br/>love or something, I might build up some sort of associations or &quot;pattern<br/>recognition&quot; that would give meaning to the experience. But I&apos;ll never know<br/>as the piece itself just doesn&apos;t attract me enough to volunteer constant<br/>listening. For that matter, I can say the same for all those Stamitz guys<br/>in the early Manheim school. The stuff doesn&apos;t relate to anything alive in<br/>my head, but I know that&apos;s just me and my head. I&apos;m sure there are plenty<br/>of folks who are well-versed in recent music who&apos;d say the same of Xenakis,<br/>for example. For me his music connects in myriad ways.<br/>That&apos;s about as much as I can safely say as to what makes music click for<br/>me. I&apos;m convinced that there are those for whom music works as a thing in<br/>and of itself, that is, their appreciation of it doesn&apos;t depend on further<br/>association.<br/>Any tuning that unequalizes the intervals is most welcome as all the rest<br/>of life sounds that way. Thus we get back to Arny&apos;s Violin Concerto and the<br/>12-tone-row idiom in general: as I&apos;ve occasionally posited, I think that<br/>stuff would come very much alive for me if it were performed in any tuning<br/>other than 12tet. I don&apos;t think it would matter which, just so long as all<br/>the intervals had different characteristics. Equal temperament makes that<br/>music just plain monochromatic (literally, of one color.) Subjecting it to,<br/>say, Pythagorean tuning would give it the wildness it needs.<br/>Jay</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/20/2001 10:51:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Of course, Jay, the Ives recording I&apos;m presently working on will be in the<br/>Pythagorean you have hoped for (and Ives preferred).

But<br/>I note with amusement that they all date from my own favorite<br/>period in Schoenberg&apos;s career: 1906-12.  And one piece that<br/>*must* be included in this group is the incredible _Erwartung_,<br/>which I&apos;ve been listening to daily for about the last month.</p><p>_A Survivor From Warsaw_ is much later, one of Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>last works (1947).  His heart stopped beating for a few minutes<br/>in 1946, and after he was revived with injections directly into<br/>his heart, he wrote a few really amazing pieces in which he<br/>applied his 12-tone technique to the expressionistic style<br/>of the pieces Joe recommends: his _String Trio_ (in which he<br/>depicts his temporary death) and _A Survivor From Warsaw_<br/>are my faves.</p><p>The 12-tone pieces he wrote before this (1920-45) pretty much<br/>leave me cold too.  He decided to become a neo-classicist of<br/>sorts, using old-fashioned forms and styles combined with the<br/>12-tone technique.  To my ears, he was at his best as an<br/>expressionist, whether early (1908-12) or late (1946-50).</p><p>And there&apos;s another reason why I chose _Warsaw_: it uses<br/>_sprechstimme_, which therefore makes it microtonal and on-topic.</p><p>BTW, op. 9 is the _Chamber Symphony_, *not* _Concerto_.<br/>(Berg was the one who wrote a _Chamber Concerto_.)
