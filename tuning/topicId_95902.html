The<br/>house contains a wonderful &apos;media pit&apos; with surround sound acoustics and can<br/>seat 30 comfortably. In addition, the room can be made totally pitch black<br/>so that sound concerts take on an extra-sensory aspect not afforded by a<br/>more traditional public venue. The experience is akin to a<br/>sensory-deprivation tank, and music takes on extra vividness and becomes<br/>rich with synaesthetic association. The experience is not easily forgotten.</p><p>We will be featuring the following music on Saturday&apos;s concert:</p><p>winners:<br/>1st prize ($500): Monroe Golden (USA)- Incongruity<br/>2nd prize ($250): Soressa Gardner (USA)- Mayne at Midnight<br/>3rd prize ($150): Igliashon Jones (USA)- Persephone Descends<br/>finalists:<br/>David Snow (USA)- Etudes for Imaginary Harp<br/>Joseph Post (USA)- US Gold<br/>Shaahin Mohajeri (Iran)- The battle of Ahuramazda and Ahriman<br/>Martin Loridan (France)- brume, espace, temps...<br/>James Wyness (Scotland)- a dissolving view<br/>Donald Craig (USA)- Study in 31<br/>Ann Cantelow (USA)- Lu Dong Bin&apos;s Dream</p><p>We will be asking for a suggested donation of $15 for the concert plus a<br/>post-concert wine and cheese spread to celebrate the recent non-for-profit<br/>501(c)3 status of UnTwelve. If you wish to just stay for the concert only,<br/>we are asking for a suggested donation of $10 dollars.</p><p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p><p>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a></p><br/>

I happen to know, however, that CD Baby tend to<br/>double with Emusic, and I subscribe to that.  I found &quot;A<br/>Still Subtler Spirit&quot; there.  I had to &quot;buy&quot; the whole<br/>album to get the two explicitly microtonal tracks.  I have<br/>managed to trick Emusic into letting me do that.  I&apos;m<br/>listening to the second one now.  I&apos;ll have to listen more<br/>times to get a proper opinion.</p><p>So far so good.  But I&apos;m interacting with him as a<br/>customer, not a member of a community.  I can&apos;t even find<br/>anything about tuning.  Somewhere on my travels I found<br/>this page:</p><p><a href="http://www.voxnovus.com/60x60/2010_UnTwelve_Mix.htm">http://www.voxnovus.com/60x60/2010_UnTwelve_Mix.htm</a></p><p>It has the program notes for the 60x60 mix from last year.<br/>That mentions &quot;an overtone-based collection representing<br/>partials 6-27&quot; so I&apos;ll assume JI.  But there&apos;s no advice<br/>that I can use or ignore in my own music.</p><p>&gt; 2nd prize ($250): Soressa Gardner (USA)- Mayne at Midnight</p><p>I found this site:</p><p><a href="http://www.soressa.com/">http://www.soressa.com/</a></p><p>It lists projects, and they have some kind of videos.  Last<br/>night they weren&apos;t working at all, but to day something is,<br/>and it says YouTube.  I know all about that, and I know it<br/>does work for some people.  In fact, it&apos;s working for me<br/>today!  I&apos;m intermittently getting a video, the way YouTube<br/>generally works on normal connections.  I know there&apos;s a<br/>way of tricking YouTube into giving you downloads, but I<br/>haven&apos;t looked into it, so this is the best I can get.<br/>Frankly, I don&apos;t have much idea what it would sound like as<br/>music, unless it&apos;s supposed to be a post-Webernian<br/>pointillist thing.</p><p>I know the recommended solution of course: move to a big<br/>city in North America.</p><p>&gt; 3rd prize ($150): Igliashon Jones (USA)- Persephone</p><p>Well, we know him, of course.</p><p>From the 60x60 page, Robert Fanelli looked interesting.<br/>This is the most promising link:</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/wunderbandnyc">http://www.myspace.com/wunderbandnyc</a></p><p>Is it the same Robert Fanelli?  I don&apos;t know.  There&apos;s an<br/>album from 1997 on Emusic.</p><p>I could keep looking, and maybe I will.  But this is<br/>turning into a lot of work for not much result.  These much<br/>abused mailing lists are so far doing a much better job of<br/>delivering reasonably good microtonal music to me.</p><p>I&apos;m happy to play the 60x60 mix in my bedroom on a CD<br/>player I borrow from work if that means I can get my hands<br/>on the CD.  I&apos;m guessing it won&apos;t constitute a<br/>&quot;performance&quot; though.</p><p>                           Graham</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2011 12:27:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll reply to this because it&apos;s recent and it lists the<br/>&gt; competition winners.
