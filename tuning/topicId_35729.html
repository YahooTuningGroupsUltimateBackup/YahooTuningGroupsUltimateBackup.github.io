If we had a sample rate a million samples per second<br/>we would have a much higher cutof frequency (500 KHz), but doing so, we<br/>would allow higher frequency to get in the signal.

Each time you increase the<br/>number of samples, you may have the impression that you increase the<br/>interpolation accuracy, by each time, high frequencies kick in to make<br/>interpolation as bad as before. Thus, having no a priori knowledge of the<br/>amplitudes of high frequencies, a raise in the sample frequency provide<br/>extra information on those high frequencies, but give no more information on<br/>the low frequency part of the spectrum.</p><p>Have higher sampling frequency would change absolutely nothing!!</p><p>The fact that we talk about digital signal contribute to make this falsely<br/>obvious.

That is<br/>&gt; probably true to some extend, but not to an infinite precision.</p><p>Yes, probably this is why it works. Also, isn&apos;t true to infinite precision,<br/>but enough to get some improvement over the nearest FFT bin size.</p><p>&gt; you can actually find a value there, correct, but the confidence interval<br/>&gt; still remain 1/T. It may occur that, if you make the FFT of a pure sine, you<br/>&gt; find, by interpolation the original frequency with some accuracy but, then<br/>&gt; this is an artifact of the way the dataset was produced an information that<br/>&gt; you know a priori. This principle cannot increase the confidence interval<br/>&gt; for natural signal.</p><p>If you are analysing noise, probably yes. But if it is a musical instrument,<br/>the peaks are fairly symmetrical, if one looks at a detailed FFT<br/>using a long note. So it works well in that case.</p><p>One is presumably relying on some special properties of the types of sound<br/>used to make clearly pitched musical notes, but for that it increases<br/>the confidence interval.</p><p>One can demonstrate that it works. If you find the frequency of a constant<br/>pitch musical note using a short sample of say 0.1 seconds using peak<br/>interpolation, then do another analysis of 1 second to find the nearest FFT<br/>bin size, by the usual non peak interpolation method, you end up with the<br/>same frequency as you got using the peak interpolation method for the short sample.</p><p>Confidence intervals are based on statistics - what is the probablity that<br/>the actual pitch of the note is within so many standard deviations<br/>of the measured value. So if you find that a method increses the<br/>probability of being within a particular range of the target pitch,<br/>that means you have reduced the confidence interval, and improved the<br/>accuracy. That is just the definition of a confidence interval.</p><p>So this shows that peak interpolation reduces the confidence interval,<br/>and in my experience, it does so by about an order of magnitude<br/>(factor of ten) for most musical timbres.</p><p>If there is some theory that says that this is impossible, then<br/>it isn&apos;t in accord with results, and needs to be revised -<br/>experiment should drive theory rather than the other way round.</p><p>Also what about the thing about perceiving a quarter note pitch change<br/>using notes of a tenth of a second. That isn&apos;t at all controversial<br/>I&apos;d have thought. It is very easy for many to do.</p><p>My guess is that _if_ the ear does rely on fft like methods then<br/>it is using some type of peak interpolation, and those who<br/>are particularly good at discriminating pitch have learnt to<br/>interpolate better. I assume that they are still hearing much the same<br/>way as anyone else - because physically we all have pretty<br/>much the same perception. Except of course, maybe some will<br/>lack the fine hairs altogether and be deaf, or have very<br/>few of them and maybe be unable to discriminate pitch<br/>at all well.</p><p>(Some who can&apos;t distinguish pitch at all well, even notes<br/>a semitone apart, may just have never learnt to give it<br/>particular attention, and may be physically able to if they<br/>were to do some training).</p><p>I imagine fine pitch discrimination is something that can be learnt,<br/>e.g. by spending many hours a day tunign a musical instrument,<br/>one would probably increase ones pitch perception by gradually<br/>learning to do the peak interpolation better.</p><p>As for the zero crossing rate - to get it to work you<br/>need to be able to measure the exact time of the zero<br/>crossings.</p><p>If you have a pure sine wave, or nearly, no higher<br/>harmonics, then it will work, and even if you<br/>increase the sample rate, if there are no higher<br/>harmonics in the waveform to find, then there<br/>is nothing to perturb the positions of the zero<br/>crossings.</p><p>Just to explain it a bit more clearly.</p><p>Suppose you have 500 waves, and you<br/>measure the exact time of the first<br/>zero crossing, and the last one, and the<br/>time interval between the two is, say<br/>0.851323 seconds, or whatever it is.</p><p>Just divide one by the other<br/>500/0.851323</p><p>to get frequency of<br/>587.323216</p><p>Then if you work out the time interval to<br/>greater precision, the frequency is more accurate.</p><p>This can be done even with a single wave -<br/>measure the exact time for a single wave<br/>to great accuracy and you get a good frequency<br/>determination.</p><p>The only way I can imagine this mightn&apos;t work is if<br/>you can&apos;t measure the waveform accurately in the first<br/>place - if there is some inaccuracy in the measurement<br/>of the samples. But, we aren&apos;t talking about quantum<br/>mechanics here, where there is some fundamental<br/>limitation on what can be measured.</p><p>Improve the accuracy of the measurement of the individual<br/>samples, and increase the sample rate, and you<br/>will improve the precision with which you know<br/>the waveform.</p><p>(presumably there is some limit eventually when you<br/>meet the discrete nature of air as made up of individual<br/>molecules, but at order of 10^27 or so<br/>molecules involved, that is probably not going to<br/>be reached easily).</p><p>Now if the waveform is better known, and it has<br/>no higher harmonics in it, then you get a<br/>very accurate count.</p><p>Even if it has higher harmonics, if those are of<br/>lower amplitude than the first harmonic, then<br/>they don&apos;t in practice affect the position of the<br/>zero crossing noticeably.</p><p>Even if they are of higher amplitude than the first<br/>harmonic, but are multiples of its frequency,<br/>that also doesn&apos;t affect the zero crossing<br/>method appreciably either, as the harmonics<br/>wont perturb the position of the zero crossings at<br/>all if they are at exact multiples of the frequency<br/>of the fundamental. All harmonic timbres<br/>fall into this category.</p><p>So the wave counting method has a lot of promise<br/>in it. In practice it seems to do even better than<br/>FFT with peak interpolation for suitable waveforms,<br/>- maybe getting on for another order of magnituede improvement<br/>in pitch recognition if you are lucky.</p><p>I&apos;d be interested to know what it is that signal<br/>processing theory has proved.</p><p>It seems at any rate that with musical notes and typical<br/>musical timbres, e.g. reasonably harmonic ones (I expect<br/>some inharmonic ones too if they aren&apos;t just a kind of<br/>coloured noise) that one can go beyond the limitations<br/>by one or two orders of magnitude. With the wave crossing<br/>method, in principle there is no limitation at all if<br/>the waveform is a harmonic timbre as the higher harmonics<br/>don&apos;t perturb the positions of the zero crossings.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=35761 href="#35761">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2002 12:58:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., LAFERRIERE Fran&ccedil;ois &lt;francois.laferriere@c...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Paul wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Much has been made of the 3- and 4- cent deviations from JI in<br/>72-tET<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chords.

So in fact, the relationship between precision<br/>deltaF (in<br/>&gt; Hz) and length of the window T is simply deltaF = 1/T (not 2*pi/T).<br/>In spite<br/>&gt; of this 2*pi factor, Paul is basically correct about the classical<br/>&gt; uncertainty principle.</p><p>in my original message, which appeared many months ago, i was citing<br/>a website which was using a particular definition of uncertainty.<br/>perhaps that&apos;s what you guys should be replying to, if you can find<br/>it.</p></div><h3><a id=35773 href="#35773">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2002 2:23:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi robert,</p><p>would you mind subjecting the &apos;jerries&apos; to your analysis algorithm?<br/>it&apos;ll be interesting to see what cents values you come up with.<br/>perhaps this will show francois the utility of your methods better<br/>than any verbal explanation?</p><p>see gene, the possible uses of the &apos;jerries&apos; keep multiplying! :)</p></div>
