This is the<br/>ultimate triumph of the Riemann 3^(-1,0,1) paradigm, since it seems,<br/>according to him, that that&apos;s all there is, anyway :-).</p><p>In a way, this experiment reminded me of a time at the University of<br/>Delaware where I had been invited as &quot;guest&quot; composer and conducted a large<br/>chamber piece.  [Sorry, had to blow my horny -- just human nature...]</p><p>In their computer rooms, they had &quot;computer assisted&quot; music theory, one of<br/>the most developed in the nation at that time (er.. 1988).  They had touch<br/>computer screens and focused on 4-part harmony -- one would enter pitches<br/>by touching parts of the computer screen...</p><p>Well, it was Summer, and very hot.  The computers went amok, and all the<br/>ear-training turned out entirely discordant.  None of the pitches were<br/>correct, except that, somehow they all seemed to end on nice 5-limit<br/>triadic consonances at the end.  We, ultimately, figured the computers were<br/>unintentionally doing a &quot;Hindemith emulation...&quot;</p><p>In any case, I wasn&apos;t sure I had the listening experience with these kinds<br/>of tunings to offer much and resisted posting.  Upon reading Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>response and Monz&apos; response, I realize my own reactions were really not<br/>that far &quot;off the mark&quot; and were interesting...  I have not changed them<br/>since reading the reactions of others:</p><p>I enjoyed Dave Keenan&apos;s adaptive just intonation sample probably the most<br/>if the JIs.  The V-7 was not as &quot;sweet&quot; as the &quot;big third&quot; of the 12-tET,<br/>which seemed almost &quot;perfumed&quot; to me.  (Perfume the &quot;ultimate&quot;<br/>fabrication?)</p><p>I thought the 5-limit 5:9, with the large ratios 27/20, 15/8 in the V-7 was<br/>pretty terrible, pretty discordant.  I think Paul Erlich came to the same<br/>conclusion...  HOWEVER, I agree with Joe Monzo and enjoyed the 7-limit<br/>adjustment with the 21/16 rather than the 27/20 for the &quot;F&quot; of the V-7.  I<br/>know this is a disagreement with Paul Erlich on the 7-limit but, in a way,<br/>it is consistent with some of my previous posts regarding the John de<br/>Laubenfels&apos; files.  It must be that Paul is looking for some kind of<br/>consistent tuning paradigm, and some of the rest of us are just enjoying<br/>the &quot;weirdness.&quot;  I guess that&apos;s OK by me...</p><p>The Pythagorean, to me, had the &quot;sweet&quot; sound of the V-7 that was in the<br/>12-tET.  Is it supposed to do that??  I guess the thirds are quite large in<br/>Pythagorean, right??</p><p>Finally, I have to agree with Paul Erlich (always a safe bet, but this was<br/>BEFORE I read his post) that the 7 limit 64:81 is really terrible.  It is<br/>the woist.  It seemed to combine a somewhat discordant IV and the<br/>sickeningly &quot;sweet&quot; V-7.  Uccch...  Joe Monzo seemed to find this OK, so<br/>there is a wide range of opinion on this sample.</p><p>Finally, curiously, I found the 1/4 comma meantone sample the best of all.<br/>It seemed natural, balanced, and harmonious.  Let&apos;s all go back to it! (??)</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=8671 href="#8671">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I do enjoy weirdness, and in listening to these<br/>files I wasn&apos;t looking for a &quot;consistent tuning paradigm&quot;. But I _was_<br/>looking for what sounded best relative to my acculturated musical ears. What<br/>would I enjoy hearing in a performance of &quot;conventional&quot; music? What would<br/>sound like a &quot;mistake&quot; or &quot;amateurish&quot; to me?</p><p>&gt;Finally, curiously, I found the 1/4 comma meantone sample the best of all.<br/>&gt;It seemed natural, balanced, and harmonious.  Let&apos;s all go back to it! (??)</p><p>By the way Joe, what was your reaction to the JI version with 9:16 seventh<br/>(the one Carl and I both liked best of all)? You left that one out. It seems<br/>odd that your favorite was the meantone seventh, falling between 9:16 (996&#xFFFD;)<br/>and 5:9 (1018&#xFFFD;), but you liked the 4:7 (969&#xFFFD;) in both of the examples where<br/>the V7 was 4:5:6:7.</p></div><h3><a id=8673 href="#8673">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

It can&apos;t do<br/>everything, but what it can do, it does beautifully.  I&apos;ve been composing a<br/>large-ish piece in 1/5 comma meantone (I had started in 1/4 comma, but found<br/>that 1/5 comma was needed for the amount of modulation I required since I<br/>had restricted myself to 12 pitch classes). Although I set myself the task<br/>of working entirely from first principles, I&apos;ve been constantly surprised by<br/>the way in which features of the classical tonal language keep emerging, as<br/>if they were immanent in the tuning itself.</p><p>By all means, let&apos;s keep up the meantone revival. And not only for<br/>historical repertoire but for new compositions as well.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
