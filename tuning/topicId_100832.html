It<br/>&gt;&gt; sounds like a chord progression in 12-tet in which the pitch slowly<br/>&gt;&gt; drifts until you end back from where you started. Which is what comma<br/>&gt;&gt; pumps often sound like<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe that&apos;s because the first and last chord of the smaller part of the &gt; progression are essentially a syntonic comma apart (like F, Bb, Eb, C\, &gt; F\).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; (although I&apos;m really getting the hang of<br/>&gt;&gt; porcupine as its own &quot;thing&quot; now), but amity&apos;s is so gradual that it<br/>&gt;&gt; almost feels &quot;artificial&quot; to me. I feel like the non-major 7 one was<br/>&gt;&gt; easier to hear as a &quot;different&quot; thing. Not sure why that is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thought about your porcupine suggestion yesterday and tried to make a &gt; list of step sizes which would make a maximal tetradic pump in some &gt; temperaments which I&apos;ve selected for the time being.<br/>&gt; Here I&apos;m disregarding the fact if the pump goes in one direction or the &gt; other, I&apos;ve just chosen the step sizes in such a way that all of them &gt; could be greater than 1/1.<br/>&gt; If you find mistakes there, don&apos;t be surprised - I was doing it all in my &gt; head.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, this is what I&apos;ve got:<br/>&gt; Meantone, porcupine, tetracot, superpyth, semisixth, unicorn, amity<br/>&gt; 5/4, 16/15<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hanson<br/>&gt; 3/2, 16/15<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Magic, wuerschmidt<br/>&gt; 3/2, 10/9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Diaschismatic, negri, schismatic, passion, orwell, miracle<br/>&gt; 6/5, 10/9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
