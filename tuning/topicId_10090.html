A good way to begin is to find out first what<br/>you can do with your sound card, at least before deciding to invest more in<br/>an expensive keyboard.  If you have a windows machine and any standard midi<br/>keyboard, Graham Breed&apos;s &quot;Midi Relay&quot; <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/software.htm">www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/software.htm</a><br/>might be a handy way to get started.  Manuel op de Coul&apos;s  &quot;Scala&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/xen/scala/">http://www.tiac.net/users/xen/scala/</a>  provides a wealth of tools for working<br/>with scales both analytically and for generating tuning commands, i.e. for<br/>Midi Relay. If you have a fast machine and enough memory, &quot;Mellosoftron&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.polyhedric.com">www.polyhedric.com</a> allows you to map any sample to any key in real time,<br/>while another polyhedric product, WAVmaker, allows one to specify very exact<br/>frequencies for each pitch while rendering a midi file into a WAV file.  If<br/>you use notation, Finale 2000 has an improved pitch bend facility, although<br/>with pitch bend one has to be careful to keep midi channels distinct and<br/>pitch resolution for midi pitch bend will vary highly from card to card (WAV<br/>files, on the other hand, will not be so restricted by the sound card). I&apos;m<br/>not familar enough with Sibelius, which has had some good reviews, but the<br/>shareware &quot;Lime&quot; notation program has adequate pitch bend implementation.<br/>Finally, if you don&apos;t need any real time playing, and you like to program,<br/>then CSound may be a way to go.</p><p>If you have a Mac or Linux machine, please let the list know -- I&apos;m sure<br/>someone else will be able to help you out.</p><p>From: Keenan Pepper &lt;<a href="mailto:mtpepper@prodigy.net">mtpepper@prodigy.net</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] A Broad Question:</p><p>&gt; My parents are ready to buy me a microtunable synthesizer/keyboard of my<br/>&gt; choice.

Which one is best?</p><p>Well that would depend on what kind of tuning system you are after.  Carl<br/>Lumma suggested a few synths that only use 12 tone based tunings.  If you<br/>want the ability to have more than 12 tones per octave, then you need a<br/>synth with one or more &quot;full keyboard&quot; tuning tables.  I personally need a<br/>synth that allows you to retune any midi note number to any frequency,<br/>limited of course by the tuning resolution of the instrument.</p><p>I am very happy with my Yamaha TG77 module.  The cost was about $450 used on<br/>ebay.  It has 64 preset tuning tables with a variety of just, meantone, and<br/>ET tunings and it has two user definable tuning tables.  The resolution if<br/>1.17 cents or 1024 steps per octave/85 steps per semitone.  Depending on<br/>your music, this resolution may or may not be adequate, as it can produce<br/>noticable beating between intended JI intervals.  1.17 cents is about the<br/>best resolution available on hardware synths. The TG77 is also available in<br/>a keyboard - SY77, and has a later version in the SY99.  It is a great<br/>sounding 6 operator FM synth.  It also has sample playback for real<br/>instrument sounds and allows you to modulate the FM operators with the<br/>samples.  I have encounter some problems with retuning the higher note<br/>numbers of some sounds that use both sample waves and FM operators -- they<br/>have progressively lower amplituned the higher the note number.</p><p> It is difficult to program, and requires a PC based editor.  I purchased<br/>Sound Quest ($100) which is turning out to be a great synth<br/>editor/librarian.  If you are not into programming a synth, then there are<br/>tons of patches available.  I have over 2000 unique patches.  This series of<br/>synths is very commonly available on ebay.</p><p>I also researched the Ensoniq MR module ($500 used on ebay) Also available<br/>in keyboard form.  It is strictly a sample playback synth.  I believe its<br/>nicest feature for the microtonalist would be the .39 cent tuning<br/>resolution, although it _may_  have some problems remapping the samples when<br/>they are retuned to far, causeing a &quot;chipmunkish&quot; effect.</p><p>I would strongly recommend that you do allot of research prior to a<br/>purchase.  I would suggest the synth user reviews on <a href="http://www.harmony-central.com">www.harmony-central.com</a><br/>as a starting point.   What I did was I checked out the microtonal synthesis<br/>page at <a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal/">http://home.att.net/~microtonal/</a> , complied a list of all the synths<br/>that met my criteria (2 tuning tables, 1.17 cent resolution, full keyboard<br/>retuning).  Then I read the reviews on harmony central and did searches on<br/>ebay to check on price and availability.</p><p>Also try the following post from Brian Mclaren on John Starrett&apos;s site:<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/post164.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/post164.html</a> , which is an excellent<br/>summary of available microtonal synths, although somewhat outdated.</p><p>Darren Burgess<br/>SEJIS<br/>Gainesville, FL</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Assume I know nothing about electronics, but everything I need to on<br/>tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please help,<br/>&gt;     Keenan P.</p></div><h3><a id=10097 href="#10097">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;mtpepper@prodigy.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2000 2:23:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In &quot;Microtonal Synthesis,&quot; some synthesizers that are listed as having full<br/>keyboard retuning have a &quot;Tuning range per note&quot; of less than a semitone.<br/>What does this mean?

Of<br/>course, if you want more than 12 notes per octave, you&apos;ll need something<br/>like Ensoniq&apos;s kind of full keyboard retuning.

Many JI systems have 12 tones, all within a comma<br/>or so of 12-tET.
