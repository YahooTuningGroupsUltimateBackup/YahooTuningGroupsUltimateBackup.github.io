What good is a book you never get when you order<br/>&gt;it?</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in learning about practical just intonation, I know of<br/>no better book than Doty&apos;s Just Intonation Primer.  Helmholtz and Partch&apos;s<br/>efforts are also excellent, but both carry a lot of extra baggage.  I would<br/>just give a call to Henry Rosenthal, explain what happened, and I&apos;m sure<br/>he&apos;ll get your order shipped straight away;(415) 864-8123.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t usually write about the technical aspects of tuning because I&apos;m<br/>&gt;more concerned about composition &amp; performance.</p><p>1/1 is a great place to publish scores, as well as practical articles,<br/>about performance and the like.</p><p>&gt;The list has been quiet of late, perhaps some of our more prolific posters<br/>&gt;could be working on an article?  I doubt it.</p><p>Why always so negetive, David?</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
