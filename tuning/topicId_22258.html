If you have, for instance, a sustained<br/>trombone note on channel 1 you can also have piano notes going at the same<br/>time, provided you provide the appropriate program number (0, say,) just<br/>before each piano note or chord. The trombone note will still sustain.<br/>Pitchbend and aftertouch entries still affect the channel as a whole, so if<br/>applied to these new notes, the whole channel is affected. But, still a<br/>useful thing, I think.</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2001 12:06:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Jay Williams wrote:]<br/>&gt;By a lucky accident I see that on my Roland Sound Canvas, and I presume<br/>&gt;on other MIDI gs-compatibles, you can stuff at least two separate<br/>&gt;instruments ( programs) on the same channel.

But there&apos;s a problem!  If you have a trombone note and a<br/>piano note of the same pitch on the same channel, how do you tell it<br/>which one to turn off and which one to continue?  I hoped that by using<br/>the program number ahead of the note off, that could be specified, but<br/>it didn&apos;t seem to work, as I recall - the module picked one on its own.</p><p>Maybe you can figure out a way around this?</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Jay Williams &#x3C;jaywill@tscnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2001 8:50:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 01:06 PM 5/7/01 -0600, you wrote:<br/>&gt;if you have a trombone note and a piano note of the same pitch on the same<br/>channel, how do you tell it<br/>&gt;which one to turn off and which one to continue?

Well, shucks. Next thing I&apos;d try is to play<br/>with those separate &quot;parts&quot; that make up those more squirrelly sounds, like<br/>the one that runs in parallel 4ths number 86. Maybe you have more<br/>flexibility in editing one of those &quot;parts.&quot; I&apos;d try it now, but the<br/>manual&apos;s hiding somewhere and I don&apos;t know which of those combinations of<br/>wee buttonlets to push to turn sysex on. I don&apos;t think I can do that from<br/>the pc keyboard. D&apos;ya know how off hand? Cuz I wonder if this phenomenon<br/>hasta do with somehow controlling those separate parts.<br/>Jay<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You do not need web access to participate.
