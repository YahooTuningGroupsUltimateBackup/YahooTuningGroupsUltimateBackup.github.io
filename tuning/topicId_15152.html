Despite my mentioning of the 21st and 27th identies I have ear tested<br/>&gt;them and prefer the 11th and 13th harmonics in these circumstances.</p><p>OK!</p><p>&gt;So I<br/>&gt;will probably venture further north and south and further north east and<br/>&gt;south west in my periodicity blocks [ie more 5 and 7 less 3]</p><p>11 and 13 are distinct primes and you&apos;ll never get them by combining any<br/>number of 5s and 7s. So perhaps we should look at 13-limit periodicity<br/>blocks -- or did I misunderstand you?</p><p>By the way, on a guitar, there are additional great advantages to using<br/>equal temperaments -- same notes appear on all strings and frets go straight<br/>across . . . . 41-tone equal temperament is consistent and very accurate<br/>through the 13-limit. If you find the 41-tET approximations to your chords<br/>acceptable, you will have access to an _infinite_ expanse of the<br/>5-dimensional 13-limit lattice -- i.e., there will be no restrictions on<br/>what kind of 13-limit consonant chord you can construct on any note of any<br/>previous consonant chord . . . and then there are all kinds of intermediate<br/>possibilities between 13-limit JI and 41-tET, just as meantone is<br/>intermediate between 5-limit JI and 12-tET . . .</p></div>
