But I hope someone can give me a clue on this.<br/>I always thought that a 2D temperament could be uniquely defined by the wedgie. To my surprise, this doesn&apos;t seem to be the case if there&apos;s contorsion -- or I must be doing something wrong. For example, if I try to pair up 24d and 14c and then I try to pair up 24d and 26, I get identical wedgies. However, according to Graham&apos;s Temperament Finder, each of the resulting 2D temperaments uses a different generator and therefore a different mapping. May I know what on earth is going on here?<br/>Thanks.<br/>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=103185 href="#103185">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2012 2:20:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, Jan 25, 2012 at 5:01 AM, petrparizek2000<br/>&lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi there.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been away from the list for a few weeks recently so I haven&apos;t carefully followed the topics for some time.
