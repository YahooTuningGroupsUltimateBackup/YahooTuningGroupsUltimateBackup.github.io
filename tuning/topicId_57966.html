I&apos;ve worked my way through the tutorial.  This, one might fairly<br/>assume, is intended for Scala-neophytes to get their feet wet with.  As<br/>such, it may be the only software introduction available for musicians<br/>who want to learn about alternative tunings.  I was astounded by the<br/>depth of my ignorance!  There are so many terms I had not yet seen - in<br/>over a month on the tuning and tuning-math lists, and with much research<br/>following the links in messages on those lists - that I fear they would<br/>frighten off any but the stoutest heart ...  After all, we&apos;re there to make<br/>music, right? - rather than learn heaps of esoteric jargon ...  With Scala<br/>as an introduction, alternate tunings would seem to present, not just a<br/>steep learning curve, but an almost insurmountable barrier.  Don&apos;t get me<br/>wrong; I&apos;m sure Scala is competently written and reliable software - it&apos;s<br/>just that I was hoping for a gentler introduction.</p><p>Is there an easier way to get into using Scala than thru the tutorial?</p><p>I&apos;d love to find such a way.  Potentially, I&apos;ll be able to interest many<br/>other<br/>musicians, through the Music SIG of the Melbourne PC User Group, in<br/>exploring alternate tunings - but not if the means at hand seem to require<br/>a couple of degrees in musicology and maths ...  8-o.  I&apos;ve actually stuck<br/>my<br/>neck out, and promised to present some of this stuff within the next two<br/>months.  (How wonderfully the news of one&apos;s imminent demise focuses the<br/>brain ... !)</p><p>Challenge #2:<br/>----------------<br/>So far, I&apos;ve had no luck in SENDing a tuning to my Roland E-28, a GS<br/>instrument, using either SET SYNTH 107 or SET SYNTH 109.  This is<br/>rather puzzling ... I&apos;m _dying_ to hear some of the scales I&apos;ve been cooking<br/>up!</p><p>Can anyone help me please?  Undying musical gratitude will be your reward,<br/>even a dedication of the first Scala .seq files notating my newly-liberated<br/>compositions ... :-o</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>------------------------------------------------<br/>      Yahya Abdal-Aziz<br/>      <a href="mailto:Yahya@MelbPC.Org.Au">Yahya@MelbPC.Org.Au</a><br/>      Melbourne PC User Group<br/>      Convener, Music Interest Group<br/>------------------------------------------------<br/>PS - MelbPC (the Melbourne PC User Group) has about 12,000 _current_<br/>members.</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.9.9 - Release Date: 13/4/05</p></div><h3><a id=57980 href="#57980">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
