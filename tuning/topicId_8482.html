Can I prove it. Probably not.<br/>&gt;Do I believe it? Absolutely. (At least until someone provides reasonable<br/>&gt;evidence to the contrary.) Has anyone been to the seventeenth century<br/>&gt;lately?</p><p>Jerry, the same line of reasoning led many to argue (a few months back on<br/>this list) that the ratios of 5 _had_ to be used for thirds and sixths in<br/>early to middle Medieval times. I feel Margo Schulter and others made a<br/>powerful case that the historical evidence indicates that these intervals<br/>were compositionally used, and perceived, as _dissonant_. Dissonant ratios<br/>are not ones whose ratios are perceived clearly. The only ratio-based guides<br/>to their tuning would have been chains of relations by 2:3 or 3:4, operating<br/>alongside certain cadential tendencies that may have biased major thirds and<br/>sixths toward &quot;expansion&quot; and minor thirds and sixths toward &quot;contraction&quot;.</p><p>Much as the thirds and sixths were unstable sonorities in early to late<br/>Medieval times, the diminished fifth was an unstable sonority in Renaissance<br/>through Classical times, and hence its tuning was likely inflenced quite<br/>strongly by the 5:6|5:6 intervallic structure normally contained within it,<br/>and also somewhat by the 3:4 relation existing between the &quot;seventh of the<br/>dominant&quot; and the &quot;tonic&quot;.</p><p>&gt;In that sense, Fokker&apos;s interval names can be seen<br/>&gt;as &quot;non functional&quot; in that they fail to reflect the &quot;common practice&quot; that<br/>&gt;likely arose as a result of flexible tuning and Fokker, like others before<br/>&gt;him, appears to encase &quot;common practice&quot; in the coffin of keyboard<br/>&gt;limitations.</p><p>We need a historical reality check. Wolf, Schulter, et. al., did &quot;common<br/>practice,&quot; specifically the use of the tritone to define tonal keys, arise<br/>as a result of flexible tuning or as a result of keyboards and lutes or some<br/>combination of the two?</p></div>
