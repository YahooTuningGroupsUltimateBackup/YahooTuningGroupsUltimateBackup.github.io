Theme is purely COHERENCE.<br/>Transposition, comma problems or enharmony haven&apos;t to emerge at this level.<br/>In Descartes tradition, splitting contributes to understanding. I&apos;ll be<br/>glad to debate at coherence level, but it would be too heavy for me to<br/>discuss about what someone may presume as consequences for tuning. That<br/>implies much more concepts. I use also results of Paul H. Erlich&apos;s theory<br/>as starting point. I hope having catched the general ideas in my synthetic<br/>references. If not, I assure that it wouldn&apos;t a disguised criticism and<br/>that it would be due only to insufficient reading. ]</p><p>At first glance (I mean in apparence), harmonic entropy theory seems to<br/>have few to say about scales structure since it concerns mainly smoothing<br/>and upper limitation of dissonance curve on intervals continuum. It appears<br/>like a &quot;realistic&quot; justification of Euler&apos;s principle about trend to<br/>perceive intervals near simple ratio as this simple ratio. But curves<br/>exhibit severe limitation at only few exceptional attractors among ratios.<br/>On what, (Width, Sonance) logarithmic representation of Stern-Brocot tree<br/>was given a congruent anticipation. So entropy theory seems to half-open<br/>the door to introduce heuristic approach of COHERENCE. It&apos;s a basic concept<br/>of macrotonal theory about scales structure.</p><p>In gammier theory, Width and Sonance, concerning intervals, are distinct<br/>dimensions. The way mathematicians link the two (partially ordered)<br/>perceptions, using irrationals, is a pitfall for representation. It&apos;s only<br/>in mathematical heaven that Width and Sonance belong to same dimension.<br/>This reduction, that implies infinity, is absolutely out of perception<br/>possibilities.</p><p>Keeping in mind the irreductibility (by mean of perception) of the two<br/>dimensions, we can observe, in chosen set of tones, that tones have well<br/>distinct bidimensional comparitivity profiles. Since tones 9/8 and 10/9 are<br/>in slow slope dissonance curve, they are more easily ordered as Width than<br/>as Sonance. (However, choice between 9/8 and 10/9 in harmonic context<br/>implies comparison with other tones, as we&apos;ll see, and then difference<br/>intervals may be easily ordered as Sonance.) On the other hand, the most<br/>consonant ratios have, inversely, better comparativity as Sonance than as<br/>Width, mainly for exceptional reinforcements like it appears on dissonance<br/>curve and also on representation in bidimensional tonal spaces.</p><p>Adding now a bit of macrotonal ingredients, we can build a gammier<br/>structure in heuristic way. (I would like to emphasize that gammier theory<br/>don&apos;t stand out  a similar approach but have a much deeper mathematical<br/>foundation. It&apos;s just much easier to look at gammier, in first approach,<br/>without maths.)</p><p>Before starting to build a global COHERENT structure, we could look at an<br/>intermediate level, how coherence question may arise with a known simple<br/>example implying chordal concordance. I note that concordance measuring<br/>approach of tetrads in entropy theory sensibly address similar problem.<br/>I&apos;ll just add, in this first example, a tonal context (and not a global<br/>context). I won&apos;t use here measured values but it will be easy to make<br/>parallel with tetrads ranking problem and see why talking about concordance<br/>rather than dissonance is required. Even if the term &quot;concordance&quot; I use in<br/>French, as mathematical concept, is different of the first one, word<br/>similarity is not fortuitous. Collective properties of tones are concerned<br/>in both cases (even if level changes). Such properties can&apos;t be seen as<br/>simple scalar sum of individual properties. Interaction is the dominant<br/>factor.</p><p>Let C=(1) be the tonic in a set of tones where we find also F=(4/3),<br/>G=(3/2), A=(5/3), B=(15/8). Which of D=(10/9) or D=(9/8) would be more<br/>concordant ?<br/>We have seen that 9/8 and 10/9 can hardly be ordered relatively to Sonance.<br/>Is this fact implies difficulties to choose them in harmonic context ? Let<br/>us compare the two chords (D F A) and (G B D). We seek for the best<br/>concordant X in the two following cases, (X 4/3 5/3) and (3/2 15/8 X). We<br/>have here, successively,</p><p>     (tones)     ==   (ratios)    == (complexities vector)</p><p>(10/9  4/3  5/3) == (10:12:15)    == (30,20,6)<br/>( 9/8  4/3  5/3) == (27:32:40)    == (864,20,1080)<br/>( 3/2  4/3 20/9) == (108:135:160) == (20,864,1080)<br/>( 3/2  4/3  9/4) == (4:5:6)       == (20,30,6)</p><p>Obviously choice of D depends of chord choice.</p><p>Minor tone 10/9 is clearly more concordant in given minor triad.<br/>Major tone  9/8 is clearly more concordant in given major triad.</p><p>If interaction is important at chord level let imagine how interaction of<br/>tones and chords could be important at global level.</p><p>We can now facing global level. I recall it&apos;s an heuristic process and that<br/>we have shown quickly but clearly, I hope, that tones may have very<br/>different bidimensional comparativity profiles.</p><p>To build our structure, let us begin with choice, after {1}, of the four<br/>best consonances in first octave {5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3}. We understand easily<br/>that harmonic interactions implying these tones will be the most<br/>determining of all context (due to extreme reinforcement). Besides, we<br/>understand easily that limiting free combinatory of these tones would be an<br/>artifice (possibly relevant only at stylistic level). Now, before adding<br/>new tones, let us see which tones are soon implied by total free use of the<br/>four best consonances.</p><p>After {1} and {5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3} we see minimaly that the three steps in<br/>the series are forcely soon implied. And we understand immediately that the<br/>comparativity profile of these intervals are very different. The steps<br/>{16/15, 9/8, 10/9} appears mostly as Width than as Sonance. And here, not<br/>only the tones can be ordered, but 16/15 appears easily in Width as half of<br/>9/8 or 10/9. The approximative Width relation 4-5-7-9 (12-tET) for the best<br/>consonances is less immediate than 1-2 for the steps. Using more than an<br/>octave implies also all inverses : {8/5, 6/5} and {15/8, 16/9, 9/5}. Since<br/>we have soon 13 tones, let us imagine that it could be complete and let us<br/>see how musical modes could be related to this chosen context.</p><p>The tones collected are :</p><p>{1, 16/15, 10/9, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 16/9, 9/5, 15/8}</p><p>Let us define a musical mode as contiguous unidirectional path through<br/>octave. This simple definition has no sense without context because, and<br/>only because, the term contiguous require a context. We have to determine<br/>previously what is contiguous and what is not. In a previously chosen<br/>context like our set of 13 ratios, contiguous is obviously defined. Some<br/>tones can&apos;t be divided by lower tones in the set. Excepted {1}, these tones<br/>are the prime tones of the set, and  a contiguous path has only steps pick<br/>out among the prime tones. Here we have only {16/15, 10/9, 9/8} as<br/>contiguous steps.</p><p>Analysing all possibilities, we find 16 modes in this context. All these<br/>modes have 7 degrees. Much of these modes are well-known like the dual<br/>Doristi diatonic mode (main mode of Aristoxenus System presented here in<br/>its original descending form) and Zarlino major mode.</p><p>                      2 16/9 8/5 3/2 4/3 6/5 16/15 1</p><p>                       1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2</p><p>Something seems magic with that and arbitrary. As heuristic process, it&apos;s<br/>effectively arbitrary. It&apos;s easy to misunderstand, by pure impression, that<br/>Zarlino context is promoted. Zarlino context has no privilege in the<br/>theory. Also, it&apos;s not easy to detect what are the operating concepts and<br/>how they could permit to build much more contexts.</p><p>I could soon pointed out these concepts but I&apos;m not certain that heuristic<br/>way is the good one on the List. I&apos;ll wait for feedback before to progress<br/>in that way. If bells won&apos;t soon be ringing it will be better to proceed<br/>more formally or yet with questions like &quot;What is a musical scale ?&quot;.</p><p>I would like to terminate with an aspect of all musical contexts described<br/>by the (gammier) theory and applied here to our 13 ratios. There exist a<br/>matrix analog to Partch&apos;s diamonds for each COHERENT context. But<br/>generators are not limited by the concept of N-limit. Not only this matrix<br/>gives the ratios, but the algebric composition law on these ratios is<br/>totally defined by this matrix. I give here two matrix. The first one<br/>generates more easily the 13 ratios and the (factorization) lattice of<br/>musical modes. This matrix generate the context as LARGE CHORDOID and as<br/>such don&apos;t give the complete composition law. The second matrix generates<br/>the same context as CHORDOID and then defines the complete composition law.<br/>The first matrix is ordered to allow direct reading of the lattice (degrees<br/>are on diagonals). The second matrix is ordered to show constitutive<br/>harmonic properties.</p><p>      15    1     9     5</p><p>15    1   16/15  6/5   4/3</p><p> 1  15/8    1    9/8   5/4</p><p> 9   5/3  16/9    1   10/9</p><p> 5   3/2   8/5   9/5    1</p><p>     9/8                  15/8<br/>    /   \                 /   \<br/>   /     5/4           5/3     \<br/>  /     /   \         /   \     \<br/>1 - 10/9     4/3 - 3/2     9/5 - 2<br/>  \     \   /         \   /     /<br/>   \     6/5           8/5     /<br/>    \   /                 \   /<br/>    16/15                 16/9</p><p>      1     5     3     15    9</p><p> 1    1    5/4   3/2  15/8   9/4</p><p> 5   4/5    1    6/5   3/2   9/5</p><p> 3   2/3   5/6    1    5/4   3/2</p><p>15   8/15  2/3   4/5    1    6/5</p><p> 9   4/9   5/9   2/3   6/5    1</p><p>I imagine that most members can appreciate the coming closer of Partch and<br/>constitutive classical harmony through this diamond a few magically built.</p><p>Pierre Lamothe</p></div><h3><a id=14261 href="#14261">ðŸ”—</a>Pierre Lamothe &#x3C;plamothe@aei.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/2000 6:36:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oups... yet an error!</p><p>In message 14259,  9/8 and 10/9 have been inversed.

Why do the first five<br/>tones (or seven, if you go into the lower<br/>octave as well) get chosen only based on<br/>their concordance against the 1/1, and not<br/>based on their concordance with one<br/>another, while subsequent tones are not<br/>chosen based on their concordance with 1/1<br/>but only based on their concordance with<br/>other tones? It seems you need to justify<br/>your choice of the number five (or seven) as<br/>a delimiter between the two stages of scale<br/>formation. It certainly would seem hard to<br/>justify based on considerations of the history<br/>of musical practice.

And<br/>here, not<br/>&gt; only the tones can be ordered, but 16/15 appears easily in Width as<br/>half of<br/>&gt; 9/8 or 10/9.

These are the tones that are<br/>consonant (within the 5-limit) against 1/1. All<br/>of Partch&apos;s diamonds come from choosing<br/>certain minimum level of consonance against<br/>the 1/1, as defined by odd-limit. A use of<br/>the Partch diamond construction without the<br/>odd-limit, hence without a minimum<br/>consonance requirement against the 1/1,<br/>would require a whole new raison d&apos;etre.</p><p> Not only this matrix<br/>&gt; gives the ratios, but the algebric composition law on these ratios<br/>is<br/>&gt; totally defined by this matrix.</p><p>I&apos;d like to understand what you mean by<br/>this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       15    1     9     5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 15    1   16/15  6/5   4/3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  1  15/8    1    9/8   5/4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  9   5/3  16/9    1   10/9<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  5   3/2   8/5   9/5    1</p><p>That&apos;s neat, and I&apos;m sure Partch would have<br/>enjoyed seeing that work out too, but I<br/>don&apos;t see the principle behind it.

Erlich message # 14331<br/>        Answer - Part II<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>Quoting message 14259 (14261) :</p><p>&lt;&lt; After {1} and {5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3} we see minimaly that<br/>   the threesteps in the series are forcely soon implied. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Paul wrote (14331) :</p><p>&lt;&lt; I don&apos;t understand this. Why do the first five<br/>   tones [..snip..] get chosen only based on<br/>   their concordance against the 1/1, and not based<br/>   on their concordance with one another,<br/>   while subsequent tones are not chosen based<br/>   on their concordance with 1/1 but only based on<br/>   their concordance with other tones? &gt;&gt;</p><p>(1) I&apos;ve soon begin to answer in 14333 message.</p><p>(2) I recall it&apos;s an arbitrary starting point. There exist a very large<br/>space of coherent structures (gammiers). Here is an heuristical way to<br/>build one of them without mathematical axioms.</p><p>(3) The values {1/1, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3} are not chosen simply for their<br/>actual relation to 1/1 but mainly for the potential to have between them<br/>great concordance. We have here, reordered, the Maj9 chord</p><p>  2/3__5/6__1/1__5/4__3/2  ==  8:10:12:15:18</p><p>which contains much subchords like 2 major triads 4:5:6, 1 minor triad<br/>10:12:15, Maj7 and min7 tetrads 8:10:12:15 and 10:12:15:18, etc.</p><p>(4) Once free use principle is applied to these 5 tones, the subsequent<br/>tones are not chosen based on their concordance with these 5 tones but they<br/>are implied as difference tones between them, without regard to their<br/>position in dissonance curve. They are simply there, without direct choice<br/>(choice is free use).</p><p>It&apos;s why I talk about diversity in kind of tones in a coherent set. (I<br/>refer to comparativity profiles in witdth and sonance dimensions). It could<br/>be particularly incoherent to applied free use principle to difference<br/>tones like {16/15, 10/9, 9/8}. These tones act, in the chosen set, above<br/>all as width. When they are used in chords, we have seen, with the example<br/>of choice between 9/8 and 10/9, that their proper sonance qualities are not<br/>determinant : concordance discrimination arise from difference tones<br/>sonance qualities. What they need is coherent qualities like having common<br/>factors with other tones of the set.</p><p>--------</p><p>Paul wrote (14331) :</p><p>&lt;&lt; It seems you need to justify your choice of the<br/>   number five (or seven) as a delimiter between the<br/>   two stages of scale formation. It certainly would<br/>   seem hard to justify based on considerations of<br/>   the history of musical practice. (In case anyone&apos;s<br/>   confused, the five note scale 1/1 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3<br/>   and the seven note scale 1/1 6/5 5/4 4/3 3/2 8/5 5/3<br/>   have nothing to do with the pentatonic and heptatonic<br/>   scales of historical importance -- neither Pierre nor<br/>   I are suggesting that they do). &gt;&gt;</p><p>(1) You&apos;re right saying there is no consideration of the history of musical<br/>practive. Practice implies tuning problems which are not in the scope of<br/>this discussion. I add also that the &lt;&lt; five note scale &gt;&gt; and the &lt;&lt; seven<br/>note scale &gt;&gt; are not, here, scales at all. The five notes are a chord and<br/>the seven notes are a simple subset of the 13.</p><p>(2) The number 5 is not a theoric delimiter. The 13 tones generated are the<br/>set of tones corresponding to gammier 9 generated by the chord (1 3 5 9<br/>15). The &quot;chordic dimension&quot; here is 5. By convention let us write 5H. The<br/>first 5H corresponds to gammier 4 generated by (1 3 5 9 11). The first 4H<br/>corresponds to  gammier 1 generated by (1 3 5 9). The first 6H corresponds<br/>to gammier 11 generated by (1 3 5 7 9 15), etc. And I add, to show that<br/>large number may be used, that Indian gammoid has dimension 7H generated by<br/>(1 3 9 27 45 81 243). There is no theoric upper limit. (I would think,<br/>however, that confusion may arise using too long chordic generator, but<br/>that concerns only constitutive harmony and not vertical harmonic extension.)</p><p>--------</p><p>Quoting 14259 (14261) :</p><p>&lt;&lt; And we understand immediately that the comparativity<br/>   profile of these intervals are very different. The steps<br/>   {16/15, 9/8, 10/9} appears mostly as Width than as Sonance.<br/>   And here, not only the tones can be ordered, but 16/15<br/>   appears easily in Width as half of 9/8 or 10/9. The<br/>   approximative Width relation 4-5-7-9 (12-tET) for the best<br/>   consonances is less immediate than 1-2 for the steps. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Paul wrote (14331) :</p><p>&lt;&lt; I&apos;m having trouble understanding the implications<br/>   of Width-Sonance Comparativity (?). &gt;&gt;</p><p>(1) I think I&apos;ve partially answered at (4) of the first question.</p><p>(2) I would like to say that I never used this expression before. I<br/>believed that it could only help me to explain.</p><p>(3) I seek to say that all tones in a coherent set don&apos;t play an equivalent<br/>role. For unison 1/1 it&apos;s obvious. In a simple approach (without theoric<br/>tools) to constitute a coherent set we could focus on width or sonance.<br/>Focusing on width would mean look first at tones having &quot;width profile&quot;<br/>like contiguous steps. We would have to discover how they combine and see<br/>after resulting harmony. Other way is easier. Focusing on sonance means<br/>look first at type of chords in view starting with tones having &quot;sonance<br/>profile&quot; and then obtain  other tones by simple matrix of difference tones.</p><p>--------</p><p>That closes Part II of the answer.

It&apos;s probably the most important<br/>thing to understand at this moment : distinction between microtonal and<br/>macrotonal properties.

The term coherence refer directly to<br/>algebraic structures in math manipulation and paradigmatic structures to<br/>explain categoric perception and tonal intelligibility.</p><p>(2) What is not in the scope of the discussion, for much reasons are both<br/>tuning problematic and musical artistic structures. For the art, it&apos;s<br/>clear, I&apos;m not musician. For the tuning problematic there are many reasons.<br/>First it&apos;s soon very confused with this restricted scope. Second, I&apos;m very<br/>interested by the question but I&apos;m not prepared for that. A part of my<br/>research has for goal a renewal of the tuning problematic using new<br/>&quot;lutherie&quot; concepts. I need to work with a musician to spot missing musical<br/>ones. Third, the language barrier.</p><p>(3) For the chordic generator, I hope the graphic chordic generator example<br/>was enlightening. Since we are yet in heuristic way, I won&apos;t use heavy<br/>maths definition and I&apos;ll give only example. With gammier 9, (1 3 5 9 15)<br/>is the minimal harmonic generator building the matrix giving our 13 tones.<br/>The 5 tones used as starting tones are a chordic generator of the same<br/>matrix. It&apos;s a chord and using these 5 tones is equivalent to use (1 3 5 9<br/>15) for calculation.</p><p>Now, there exist in the matrix, five lines and five columns. These 10<br/>objects are chords : five Maj9 chords and five min9 chords. If we take any<br/>of these 10 distinct chords, we generate the same matrix of 13 tones. That<br/>are all chordic generators of gammier 9. There exist also 8 chords<br/>corresponding to generator (1 5 9 15) giving also the 13 tones but the<br/>composition law on these 13 tones is not completely explicited by the<br/>4-dimension matrix. By example, it is not explicited by the matrix that<br/>there exist 9/8 interval between 4/3 and 3/2. These two intervals appears<br/>in opposite corners of the matrix. In basic theory that refer to a LARGE<br/>CHORDOID rather than CHORDOID.</p><p>(4) I add that in gammoid (and gammier) the matrix has toroidal structure<br/>and tones class can be aligned on diagonals in matrix and circles in torus.</p><p>(5) Perhaps have you a definition for musical structure not covered by<br/>these explanations.

We need a generic term when the law is not defined as<br/>&gt;such, talking only about axioms. I use &quot;difference matrix&quot; in this sense,<br/>&gt;values being ratios, cents or whatever.</p><p>I think I get it now! The 2/3 5/6 1/1 5/4 3/2 is simply rewritten as 1 5 3<br/>15 9 and the &quot;Partch diamond&quot; (i.e. the cross-product of the set with its<br/>inverse) is calculated, giving the 13 ratios. But what motivates this? The<br/>13 ratios represent the _intervals_ between the 5 _pitches_ in {2/3 5/6 1/1<br/>5/4 3/2}. What justifies one to take these 13 ratios and reinterpret them as<br/>_pitches_?</p><p>&gt;1) Mathematically speaking, the following graph A is a chordoid. Chordoid<br/>&gt;theory don&apos;t apply only in music. Why it is a chordoid? (Forgeting details)<br/>&gt;it&apos;s because there exist a chordic generator C for this graph A</p><p>&gt;    0---O---O---O<br/>&gt;   / \ / \ / \ / \<br/>&gt;  O---0---0---O---O<br/>&gt;   \ / \ / \ / \ /<br/>&gt;    O---0---0---O</p><p>&gt;And the chordic generator C is</p><p>&gt;       0---O<br/>&gt;      / \ / \<br/>&gt;     O---0---0</p><p>&gt;How? Refering to origin, the chord C may be translated to take all the<br/>&gt;positions where one of his node occupies origin (without rotation).</p><p>Yes, Dan Stearns and others were taking many different &quot;C&quot;s and drawing the<br/>corresponding &quot;A&quot;s about a year ago on this list. You reminded me of one<br/>thing: in addition to the chordiod being interpretable as the set of<br/>intervals in the chordic generator, it&apos;s also interpretable as the set of<br/>_pitches_ created by constucting all modes of the chordic generator on a<br/>single root. So is that your justification for reinterpreting the intervals<br/>as pitches? Are you suggesting that all the modes of five-tone &quot;scale&quot; need<br/>to be constructed from a single &quot;tonic&quot;? Why?</p><p>&gt;(2) Then, If you apply that to your lattice you&apos;ll span the 13 tones I name<br/>&gt;gammier 9. Why gammier rather than chordoid? For there exist supplemental<br/>&gt;properties like abelian group isomorphism between (factorization) class of<br/>&gt;tones G/2S and cyclic integers Z/7. The paths in its factorization lattice<br/>&gt;are the musical modes.</p><p>Can you explain this?</p><p>Pierre wrote,</p><p>&gt;&lt;&lt; (2) The number 5 is not a theoric delimiter.<br/>&gt;   The 13 tones generated are the set of tones<br/>&gt;   corresponding to gammier 9 generated by the<br/>&gt;   chord (1 3 5 9 15). The &quot;chordic dimension&quot;<br/>&gt;   here is 5. By convention let us write 5H. The<br/>&gt;   first 5H corresponds to gammier 4 generated<br/>&gt;   by (1 3 5 9 11). &gt;&gt;</p><p>I wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt; What happened to 7? &gt;&gt;</p><p>&gt;(1) I never talk about 7 tones as starting point.</p><p>I meant, why did you skip the number 7 in (1 3 5 9 11)?</p><p>&gt;(2) The 7 degrees arising in gammier 9 are a macrotonal property of the 13<br/>&gt;tones took as a whole.</p><p>I understand that, but it seems that you have to construct a 13-tone<br/>chordoid scale _before_ you can get your 7-tone scale. That is what I think<br/>I&apos;ll have a hard time with. I&apos;d argue that the diatonic scale is<br/>musico-historically and logically prior to the 13-tone chordoid.</p><p>&gt;Structure is what I talk about. The term coherence refer directly to<br/>&gt;algebraic structures in math manipulation and paradigmatic structures to<br/>&gt;explain categoric perception and tonal intelligibility.</p><p>I&apos;ll like to see more about how you &quot;explain categoric perception and tonal<br/>intelligibility&quot;.</p><p>&gt;Now, there exist in the matrix, five lines and five columns. These 10<br/>&gt;objects are chords : five Maj9 chords and five min9 chords.</p><p>Yes -- the Maj9 chords are the five transpositions of the original five<br/>tones, and and min9 chords are each created by following where one of the<br/>original five tones moves during the five transpositions.</p><p>&gt;These two intervals appears<br/>&gt;in opposite corners of the matrix.</p><p>I don&apos;t immediately see what of practical importance the position in the<br/>matrix represents. At this stage, I must say your theory seems highly<br/>abstract with a preponderance of notions that correspond to no evident<br/>elements of musical reality. I seek to invoke William of Ockham and his<br/>razor -- &quot;hypotheses should not be multiplied beyond necessity&quot;. In my<br/>_Gentle Introduction to Periodicity Blocks_ I give a derivation of the<br/>various JI diatonic scales (and, in connected documents, of pentatonic<br/>scales, chromatic scales, and the sruti scale of India) with far fewer<br/>abstract notions -- and what abstract notions there are are immediately<br/>motivated by a mathematical formulation of a real musical problem that a<br/>musician may have faced. In my paper _Tuning, Tonality, and Twenty-Two Tone<br/>Temperament_, I give psychological and psychoacoustical rules for what<br/>constitutes &quot;diatonicity&quot; and so far my friends on the list and I have found<br/>only very few &quot;generalized diatonic&quot; scales -- this specialness is a more<br/>convincing explanation to me of the scale&apos;s musical importance than its<br/>derivability from a mathematical framework that seems utterly contrived<br/>(though I eagerly await further understanding which I hope will dissuade me<br/>of this opinion).</p><p>&gt;(5) Perhaps have you a definition for musical structure not covered by<br/>&gt;these explanations. If it is the case, could you explicit your definition?</p><p>Musical structure -- how music is constructed from the scale. Melody,<br/>harmony, tonality as we know them -- how do they arise? How do their<br/>development influence the further development of scales? Perhaps we should<br/>leave this aside. Though I concern myself with those &quot;musical structure&quot;<br/>issues in _Tuning, Tonality, and Twenty-Two Tone Temperament_, I don&apos;t in<br/>the _Gentle Introduction to Periodicity Blocks_. There the concern is simply<br/>harmonic connectedness and categorical clarity (which you mentioned above).<br/>Perhaps you could do me the favor of looking at</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock2.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock2.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblockex.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblockex.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock3.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock3.htm</a></p><p>and then</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/5245">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/5245</a></p><p>and then, if time permits,</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/srutipblock.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/srutipblock.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/ramospblock.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/ramospblock.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/partchpblock.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/partchpblock.htm</a></p><p>Perhaps (seems unlikely, but who knows?) it will turn out that in some<br/>sense, your theory is mathematically equivalent to periodicity-block theory.<br/>But periodicity-block theory would remain the better _musical_ theory since<br/>it _explains_ with a minimum of abstract notions. For an example of<br/>mathematically equivalent theories with different explanatory powers,<br/>consider Einstein&apos;s development of special relativity. Before Einstein,<br/>Lorentz and Fitzgerald has essentially written down all the equations of<br/>special relativity. So what was Einstein&apos;s great achievement? A few still<br/>maintain, &quot;nothing&quot;, but the vast majority of physicists see Einstein&apos;s<br/>brilliance in the _interpretation_ he gave to these equations -- in terms of<br/>time and space being relative to one&apos;s frame of reference, with all frames<br/>of reference obeying the same laws of physics. In fact, this interpretation<br/>proved so powerful that the equations themselves could be derived from it<br/>(and from the assumption that the speed of light is the same in all<br/>reference frames) -- rather than derived from considerations of a seeming<br/>natural &quot;conspiracy&quot; to hide one&apos;s state of motion relative to the medium of<br/>electromagnetic waves. When Wien recommended that Lorentz and Einstein be<br/>jointly awarded a Nobel Prize, he stated:</p><p>&quot;While Lorentz must be considered as the first to have found the<br/>mathematical content of the relativity principle, Einstein succeeded in<br/>reducing it to a simple principle. One should therefore assess the merits of<br/>both investigators as being comparable... &quot;</p><p>So, Pierre, unless I&apos;m missing large portions of your theories, they seem to<br/>be in need of underlying _musical_ principles. I would like to see if I can<br/>be the Einstein to your Lorentz (not comparing myself to Einstein in any<br/>way). Or maybe even help show that Fokker serves as the Einstein to your<br/>Lorentz (Fokker did happen to work with Einstein!).</p></div><h3><a id=14378 href="#14378">ðŸ”—</a>Pierre Lamothe &#x3C;plamothe@aei.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>10/14/2000 2:55:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yesterday, Serge, my friend and sponsor, repeat yet to me : &quot;Why do you<br/>lost your time?

However, for an eventual serious discussion about<br/>relations between structural explanation and musical understanding, I would<br/>have to insert this question in the vast philosophical debate between &quot;to<br/>explain&quot; and &quot;to understand&quot;. Paul Ricoeur shows with great luminosity the<br/>fecundity of a fine dialectic between the two irreducible cognitive modes<br/>in his article &quot;Entre herm&eacute;neutique et s&eacute;miotique&quot;, 1990.</p><p>--------</p><p>In 14371 Paul wrote :</p><p>&lt;&lt; my friends on the list and I have found only very few<br/>   &quot;generalized diatonic&quot; scales -- this specialness is<br/>   a more convincing explanation to me of the scale&apos;s musical<br/>   importance than its derivability from a mathematical<br/>   framework that seems utterly contrived. &gt;&gt;</p><p>(1) I don&apos;t understand.

I would<br/>like to talk about the coherence notion but, for now, I have to answer not<br/>only to questions about what I&apos;ve written but also to general comments<br/>about what I&apos;ve not written.</p><p>(3) Since detail about tools is far from hypothesis, I ask to me why Ockham<br/>is convoked.</p><p>--------</p><p>Quoting 14367 :</p><p>&lt;&lt; Structure is what I talk about. The term coherence refer<br/>   directly to algebraic structures in math manipulation<br/>   and paradigmatic structures to explain categoric perception<br/>   and tonal intelligibility. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Paul wrote (14371):</p><p>&lt;&lt; I&apos;ll like to see more about how you &quot;explain categoric<br/>   perception and tonal intelligibility&quot;. &gt;&gt;</p><p>             &quot;L&apos;&eacute;tonnant de la perception, c&apos;est que nous ne<br/>              cessons de d&eacute;chiffrer un sens qui s&apos;enl&egrave;ve sur<br/>              l&apos;opacit&eacute; de la pr&eacute;sence brute et muette, sans<br/>              pour autant s&apos;arracher jamais &agrave; la limitation<br/>              d&apos;une perspective, sans jamais renier l&apos;inh&eacute;rence<br/>              de la conscience &agrave; un point de vue.&quot;</p><p>                     P. Ricoeur, Hommage &agrave; Merleau-Ponty, 1961</p><p>(1) Categoric perception refers to quick integration of perceptions toward<br/>sense decoding using predeterminate categories.</p><p>(2) The expression &quot;categoric perception&quot; underlines its distinction with<br/>pure &quot;sensitive perception&quot;. Grosso modo, as correlated to acoustical<br/>parameter a sound appears like a sensitive perception and as correlated to<br/>psychic structure where it has a predeterminated place it appears like a<br/>categoric perception. Men and women have distinct pitchs and formants for<br/>the vowels. When a vowel &quot;o&quot; appears in a conversation its quick perception<br/>is categoric and organized immediately in the speech perception. But<br/>someone can be attentive to difference between female and male &quot;o&quot; and then<br/>its perceptions regress toward sensitive ones.</p><p>(3) The expression &quot;tonal intelligibility&quot; corresponds to &quot;intelligibilit&eacute;<br/>tonale&quot; where the term &quot;tonale&quot; denote class of intervals by octave<br/>equivalence. So it corresponds to a relational property rather than a<br/>sensible property. Acoustics tends to reduce interval at a sensible<br/>property like pitch for which the sensation is correlated to the frequency<br/>parameter. But an interval is not the sensible &quot;correlat&quot; of one parameter.<br/>First, it corresponds to a relation between two frequencies, such relation<br/>being not tied to a particular region of pitchs. Second, there exist<br/>minimaly two associated perceptive fields, width and sonance, informing<br/>about intervals. In this context, intelligibility refer to the possibility<br/>of a rationnal (though inconscious) organization of these relations in such<br/>manner than quick categoric perception can be obtained facilitating<br/>immediate insertion in musical woof.</p><p>(4) As mathematical, the gammier theory is purely axiomatic and as such,<br/>like all mathematical theories, it&apos;s a developped tautology. Technical<br/>rather than musical knowledge is required to derive tools. However, as it<br/>appears that gammier structures have morphology similar to long-lasting<br/>widespread musical scales like anhemitonic, by example, a speculative<br/>theory in developpement is superposed. That starts with justification with<br/>only two general principles for the axioms chaining. Main goals are to<br/>constitute a metalanguage helping musical theorists to define more<br/>rigourously their concepts and to prepare technical tools permitting<br/>perhaps a renewal of relations with technology (complexity mastering to<br/>merge with new interfaces).</p><p>(5) First step derive from &quot;How sound may act as a musical sign?&quot; I&apos;ve soon<br/>talk about possibilities to keep relations in acoustical channel. I said<br/>that intensity intervals varied with translation in pitchs and intensities<br/>spectra. So it is impossible to maintain algebraic structures other than<br/>groups based on set of oppositions. But continuous ordered structures are<br/>maintained and continous variations are largely used by music in a proper<br/>intelligibility segment, driving particularly emotions.</p><p>Only frequency and duration intervals are elementary invariants. Timbres<br/>are, in a certain manner, complex invariants (but not elementary) so their<br/>relations are hardly structurable otherwise than oppositions and they are<br/>mainly used for textures and voices distinction. Actual focus on timbres<br/>(mass work, spectral microstructures, morphing, etc.) permits to extend<br/>possibilities, but algebraic structuration is out of reach. It&apos;s not<br/>fortuitous that acuity and duration signs constitute majority of signs in a<br/>traditional partition.</p><p>(6) Second step derive from &quot;What musical functionality may be associated<br/>with algebraic structuration of pitch and duration intervals?&quot; It would be<br/>trivial to simply talk here about categoric perception and fast decoding<br/>possibilities. Questions are &quot;What is the real advantage for music?&quot; or yet<br/>&quot;What wouldn&apos;t be obtained without algebraic structuration?&quot; The main<br/>concept here is the rapid perception of similarities. Life implies dynamic<br/>identities or, in other words, keeping identity thru transformations.<br/>Musical appreciation implies not only sonorities and textures perception<br/>but also pattern simililarities recognizing and global arrangement. Even if<br/>there exist maybe much possibilities to define similarities class (like<br/>fuzzy class) it seems, in first approximation, that algebraic class concept<br/>allows a simple comprehensive distinction between paradigmatic and<br/>syntagmatic axis.<br/>It would be hard to give more details here, so I prepared in French a non<br/>musical example showing how similarity may imply algebraic structure.</p><p><a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/similar.htm">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/similar.htm</a></p><p>-Pierre</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>                             APPENDICE</p><p>(1) Quelques r&eacute;flexions de Paul Ricoeur tir&eacute;es de &quot;Structure et<br/>    herm&eacute;neutique&quot; 1963) concernant la l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; du paradigme<br/>    structural.</p><p>&lt;&lt; Pour l&apos;historicisme, comprendre, c&apos;est trouver la gen&egrave;se, la<br/>   forme ant&eacute;rieure, les sources, le sens de l&apos;&eacute;volution.
