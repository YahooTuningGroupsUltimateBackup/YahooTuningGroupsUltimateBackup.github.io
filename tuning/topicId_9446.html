Or let me<br/>&gt;rephrase that:  I should say that I like it BECAUSE of its kinda freaky<br/>&gt;sound.  It doesn&apos;t strike me as discordant, but I have been able to use<br/>&gt;it as reasonably effective a dissonance, such as resolving outward to<br/>&gt;fourths.</p><p>&gt;One that I&apos;d like to experiment with is a JI version of what Ivor Darreg<br/>&gt;found so interesting in 17TET:  Resolving 9:7, which is could be thought<br/>&gt;of as an unsettled version of a major third, outward to 7:5, which is a<br/>&gt;very consonant tritone.  That would then be more or less the reverse of<br/>&gt;the traditional tritone resolution.  One could then resolve that outward<br/>&gt;to 5:3.</p><p>The &quot;7:5&quot; is not very consonant in 17TET, where the best approximation of a<br/>7:5 is 18&cent; flat of a just 7:5.</p><p>But along similar lines, in my 22-tET paper<br/>(<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/22ALL.pdf</a>), 9:7 is the<br/>&quot;characteristic dissonance&quot; of the symmetrical decatonic scale (whose odd<br/>limit is 7), much as the tritone is the &quot;characteristic dissonance&quot; of the<br/>traditional diatonic scale (whose odd limit is 5). The term &quot;characteristic<br/>dissonance&quot; refers to an interval&apos;s occurence in the scale as a &quot;diminished&quot;<br/>version of an interval that is usually a consonance (4:3 and 3:2,<br/>respectively), allowing one to easily find one&apos;s position within the scale<br/>(hence the strong cadential quality).</p></div>
