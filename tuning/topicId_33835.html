Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2002 1:05:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Joe Pehrson, and thank you for an opportunity to<br/>appreciate how maybe my outlook is &quot;early music&quot; in a way you discuss:<br/>I am generally quite happy with &quot;sloppy notation&quot; that simply<br/>indicates which notes on a keyboard are played, and maybe includes a<br/>remark about the tuning, or general type of tuning, intended.</p><p>Please let me caution that I am not addressing the specific issues of<br/>interval naming or notation in Blackjack, but rather my experience<br/>with the tunings I typically use in terms of questions like &quot;How large<br/>is a major third like G-B, and what size should &apos;G-B&apos; indicate?&quot;</p><p>Here I&apos;d go with some medieval scholastic opinion which asserted that<br/>although Aristotle had proposed that the Earth is the &quot;proper place&quot;<br/>at which falling objects seek their rest, an object dropped near the<br/>surface of the Moon would seek the &quot;center&quot; of the Moon, and so<br/>forth.</p><p>In other words, each tuning system or style has its own sense of<br/>&quot;normalcy,&quot; and to me it makes sense to let &quot;G-B&quot; represent,<br/>typically, whatever the regular &quot;major third&quot; is in that tuning.</p><p>From my perspective, since a regular major at G-B often has a size of<br/>around 408-429 cents, I find either 5:4 or 400 cents a rather curious<br/>&quot;standard.&quot; However, I&apos;d gladly use 5:4 in 1/4-comma meantone, or 400<br/>cents in 24-EDO or 36-EDO -- where this is indeed the size of G-B.</p><p>Why don&apos;t we move through a quick survey of tunings, including one<br/>suggested, Dave Keenan, by your scenario with a meantone where the<br/>major third is equal to 23/72 octave or 383-1/3 cents?</p><p>Joe and Dave, actually I sometimes use a tuning very close to that<br/>specification, which also happens to be the first regular temperament<br/>in Western Europe documented with mathematical precision: Zarlino&apos;s<br/>2/7-comma meantone of 1558. In this tuning, the major third is 1/7 of<br/>a syntonic comma narrower than just (and the minor third wider by the<br/>same amount), or about 383.24 cents, within a tenth of a cent of the<br/>Blackjack interval you were discussing.</p><p>In this meantone, G-B is this size -- the &quot;major third&quot; of this<br/>particular intonational planet. The regular thirds aren&apos;t the only<br/>just thirds, by the way -- the diminished fourth (e.g. E3-Ab3) is<br/>around 433.52 cents, actually a bit more accurate than 36-EDO,<br/>although the fifth and minor third are definitely a bit less so!<br/>Nevertheless, we get a very nice 6:7:9 or 7:9:12, and in a wonderful<br/>16th-century tuning.</p><p>What would I call the near 9:7 third in Zarlino&apos;s tuning? Maybe a<br/>diminished fourth (in a more or less usual Renaissance style), or a<br/>supermajor third if I&apos;m using it in a neo-Gothic fashion. Anyway, I<br/>would call it something other than a simple &quot;major third,&quot; which in<br/>this tuning is about 383 cents -- G-B, the regular third from a chain<br/>of four fifths (G-D-A-E-B).</p><p>By the way, speaking of historical authenticity, following Zarlino<br/>himself we could call that near-9:7 third a &quot;semidiatessaron,&quot; meaning<br/>a &quot;less-than-fourth&quot; -- in other words, a diminished fourth. We could<br/>also follow Vicentino and call it a &quot;proximate major third,&quot; rather<br/>like the &quot;supermajor third&quot; concept. My notation confirms that<br/>whatever we call it, this third is something other than regular. For<br/>example, on a 24-note keyboard with two manuals a diesis apart (about<br/>50.28 cents), here are two ways of writing a cadence from a<br/>7:9:12-like sonority to a near-2:3:4 in neo-medieval style, with the<br/>first also available in a basic 12-note tuning of Eb-G#:</p><p>         Eb4  E4            C#*5  D5<br/>         Bb3  B3            G#*4  A4<br/>         F#3  E3            E4    D4</p><p>In the second example, the * shows a note on the upper keyboard,<br/>raised by a diesis. I find this quite descriptive, and it&apos;s how I<br/>write down a progression I find in a tuning like this.</p><p>Now suppose we shift to 36-EDO, where, like 72-EDO, a regular major<br/>third is 400 cents. To me this isn&apos;t a general &quot;standard,&quot; because I<br/>consider the symmetry of 12n-EDO a rather specialized choice, but<br/>certainly when I&apos;m using it, I&apos;m ready to recognize a 400-cent<br/>interval such as G-B as the &quot;usual&quot; third.</p><p>In 36-EDO, a near-just third of special interest to me is the near-9:7<br/>at 433-1/3 cents (13/36 octave or 26/72 octave), but I recognize again<br/>that this is something different than the _regular_ major third.</p><p>Of course, one could remark, as you have, Dave: &quot;Suppose that you were<br/>playing a 22-EDO keyboard with the notes generated from a usual chain<br/>of fifths, e.g. a 12-note tuning of Eb-G#. Now G-B would be about<br/>436.36 cents, almost the same size as this 36-EDO interval.&quot;</p><p>This is quite correct, and in each tuning G-B in my notation stands<br/>for the regular third formed by four fifths. It happens that either<br/>the diminished fourth of Zarlino&apos;s tuning, or the third a sixthtone<br/>larger than the regular 400-cent third of 36-EDO, is very close to the<br/>regular major third of 22-EDO. However, each system is distinct.</p><p>Thus when I write &quot;G-B&quot; in meantone, I mean something at or near 5:4;<br/>in 36-EDO, 400 cents; and in 22-EDO, something very close to 9:7. All<br/>of these are regular &quot;major thirds,&quot; and each tuning has its own<br/>&quot;standard.&quot;</p><p>Now let&apos;s move to a tuning where the regular major third, G-B for<br/>example, has a size very close to another 72-EDO interval. In the<br/>&quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning mentioned in the Scale Tree of Erv Wilson, and<br/>described here during the summer of 2000 by Keenan Pepper, the fifth<br/>is about 704.10 cents, giving a major third of about 416.38 cents,<br/>almost identical to the 72-EDO third at 25/72 octave or 416-2/3<br/>cents. Either interval is an excellent approximation of 14:11 (~417.51<br/>cents).</p><p>The Wilson/Pepper tuning also has a large major or supermajor third at<br/>around 446.76 cents, very close to 22:17 (~446.36 cents), which I<br/>would notate, for example, as G*3-C4 in a 24-note tuning -- a fourth<br/>less the diesis of about 49.15 cents.</p><p>It also, curiously, has a few rather exotic thirds in a 24-note tuning<br/>at about 386.01 cents, a virtually just 5:4 (~386.31 cents), which I<br/>would notate, for example, Eb4-F#*4. These thirds are formed from an<br/>augmented second plus diesis, and as the notation may suggest, are<br/>special &quot;altered&quot; intervals in this context, formed from 21 fifths up,<br/>although in meantone they (or intervals of much the same size) would<br/>define the usual &quot;major third.&quot;</p><p>So far, we&apos;ve been discussing tunings where all regular fifths, and<br/>thus also regular major thirds, have a single size -- be it 383 cents,<br/>400 cents, 416 cents, or 436 cents.</p><p>In some well-temperaments and related just systems, however, regular<br/>major thirds may have a range of sizes. Thus in George Secor&apos;s 17-note<br/>well-temperament, they vary from a just 14:11 to around 428.88 cents,<br/>with the largest thirds (closest to the simple ratio of 9:7) in the<br/>nearest keys or transpositions, and G-B as an example.</p><p>In a 17-note circulating temperament I came up with before learning of<br/>that one, these thirds range from 14:11 to 9:7; in a 17-note just<br/>tuning I&apos;ve recently developed with much inspiration from Kathleen<br/>Schlesinger and others, they range from the Pythagorean 81:64 (~407.82<br/>cents) to about 440.24 cents. As it happens, G-B is a just 14:11 in<br/>the first tuning, and very slightly narrower in the second.</p><p>Thus I would say that the notation should follow the system and the<br/>style: a 418-cent major third feels &quot;right&quot; in one setting, and a<br/>383-cent major third in another.</p><p>Of course, especially if one is writing a piece that might be<br/>performed in a range of different systems, or by performers with<br/>different expectations, then something like George Secor&apos;s notation<br/>could be very helpful.</p><p>However, I must admit that I tend to take the regular chain of fifths<br/>in a tuning as a &quot;standard,&quot; which generally leads to a &quot;regular major<br/>third&quot; (e.g. G-B) fitting the main stylistic purpose at hand. In<br/>another words, letting G-B equal 383 cents for a 16th-century<br/>meantone, but 418 cents for a neo-Gothic tuning, not only is<br/>conceptually convenient but happens to fit what I&apos;m doing musically.</p><p>By the way, there are circumstances where a &quot;usual major third&quot; could<br/>be close to either a 5:4 or an 81:64, specifically in historical<br/>tunings of the early 15th century or the late 17th-18th century era in<br/>Europe.</p><p>It&apos;s well-known that in an 18th-century well-temperament, the major<br/>thirds can range from around a just 5:4 to around Pythagorean, and a<br/>similar situation occurs in the early 15th-century Pythagorean tunings<br/>of the Dufay era that we&apos;ve sometimes discussed.</p><p>In a 12-note tuning of Gb-B, for example, from a performer&apos;s or<br/>composer&apos;s viewpoint, either G-B (81:64, ~408 cents) or A-C# (actually<br/>A-Db, 8192:6561, ~384 cents) is a &quot;usual major third.&quot; That means a<br/>mixed &quot;standard,&quot; one of the special charms of the epoch.</p><p>In a Pythagorean tuning of the Eb-G# variety, I&apos;d say that 81:64 is<br/>the &quot;standard major third,&quot; while something like C#4-F4 is a<br/>&quot;diminished fourth,&quot; which is how Johannes Boen describes it in 1357.<br/>As it happens, this altered interval at about 384.36 cents is very<br/>close to the small major third in Blackjack at ~383.33 cents, or to<br/>Zarlino&apos;s regular third in 2/7-comma meantone at ~383.24 cents.</p><p>Moving from 1357 to 1427, however, we find that _either_ size of third<br/>is standard; and by 1487 or so, at least judging from what Ramos<br/>(1482) and Gaffurius (1496) tell us, some kind of meantone temperament<br/>has made a regular major third maybe quite close to 5:4 the new<br/>keyboard &quot;standard.&quot;</p><p>In my view, this _variability_ of intervals such as &quot;regular major<br/>thirds&quot; in different tuning systems and stylistic contexts is a basic<br/>element of xenharmonicism or &quot;microtonality.&quot;</p><p>For me, to &quot;get people to take microtonality seriously&quot; means to let<br/>people know about the range of available choices out there, with<br/>beautiful music (historical or new) a very powerful form of advocacy.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=33859 href="#33859">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2002 7:29:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

It&apos;s always nice to know there are &quot;alternatives.&quot;</p><p>Of course, my naming G-B as a &quot;major third&quot; in Blackjack is mostly<br/>just a &quot;facilitator&quot; since performers have been trained that way.</p><p>Accepting that *condition* G-Bv becomes &quot;ad-just-ed...&quot;</p><p>I think it&apos;s easiest for performers to start out learning a new<br/>system this way.</p><p>However, Dave Keenan is undoubtedly right in thinking that G-Bv is<br/>*THE* important third in Blackjack, regardless of what one wants to<br/>call it.  Otherwise why would we even be *interested* in Blackjack? :)</p><p>Maybe, if *later* in their development, traditional 12-tET musicians<br/>would like to call G-Bv or the &quot;real&quot; 4:5 ratio the &quot;major third,&quot;<br/>that&apos;s OK by me.</p><p>The irony of this all is that when a musician *plays* G-Bv, s/he will<br/>most likely not be calling it *ANYTHING!*  They will just be reading<br/>the notes!</p><p>So G-Bv will be *played* correctly, and they&apos;ll let the *THEORISTS*<br/>figure out what to call it!  :)</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
