But I know what a dominant chord is.  Barbershop music contains<br/>&gt;&gt;plenty of them, often tuned 4:5:6:7.  It also contains tetrads which are<br/>&gt;&gt;not dominant chords, and are tuned 4:5:6:7, and in fact this latter type<br/>&gt;&gt;of chord is at least as plentiful as the former type in the typical<br/>&gt;&gt;Barbershop performance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Really? They&apos;re not secondary dominants or deceptive dominants? Can you<br/>&gt;give an example?</p><p>Barbershop songs modulate primarily by fifths, just as the songs of most<br/>genres.  So if you wanted, you could describe most of the 7th chords as<br/>being dominants of their successors.  But the successor is also a &quot;dominant&quot;<br/>7th, and so on.  Such an analysis wouldn&apos;t add much insight to the music,<br/>though.  And there are many progressions which would not succumb to even<br/>this perverse treatment; 4:5:6:7 tetrads are often connected by tritones,<br/>thirds, and half-steps.</p><p>Here&apos;s a phrase from &quot;Down Our Way&quot;, the first Barbershop tune I ever sang<br/>in a quartet...</p><p>F7 - Cm7 - E7 - F7<br/>&quot;How  do  you  do?&quot;</p><p>The E7 is a typical half-step &quot;passing chord&quot;.  Okay, here&apos;s a tag called<br/>&quot;Our Last Goodbye&quot;...</p><p>Bb7 - G7 - G7 - F#7 - C7 - Dm7 - BbM<br/>&quot;Will this  be  our  last  good  bye?&quot;</p><p>Here we have a modulation by a minor third, then a local dominant-tonic<br/>modulation is split into a half-step and a tritone.  Then we return<br/>symmetrically -- the Dm7 subs for the G7, and back to the tonic (by a<br/>third).</p><p>Here&apos;s a classic tag called &quot;Rainbows in the Sky&quot;...</p><p>BbM -- Bb7 - F#7 - C7 - C79 - Gm6 - Am - C7 - F7 - Dm - F7 - Eb6+9 - BbM<br/>&quot;There will  be   rai - ain - bows  in  the  Sky---------y   some   day.&quot;</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=8370 href="#8370">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

In the meantime, take a look at Forte and Mathieu (you&apos;ll<br/>absolutely _love_ the latter). Mathieu shows how, in the right contexts, a<br/>G7 chord can resolve _functionally_ to 27 different major or minor triads,<br/>including all 24 12-tET equivalence classes.</p></div>
