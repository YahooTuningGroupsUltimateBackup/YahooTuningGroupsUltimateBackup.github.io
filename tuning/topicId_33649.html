So, in 31, I would play the<br/>same thing for G Bv D as G B D.</p><p>The issue arises because traditional intonation maps<br/>meantone onto the &quot;solution to the riddle of the universe&quot;,<br/>which is more pythagorean sounding, but preserves meantone<br/>identities (in fact preserves both identities<br/>   4 * P5 = M3<br/>   8 * P4 = M3).</p><p>Keeping M3 &lt;&gt; best(5/4) in 72 seems like inventing the<br/>appendix except that it is a big part of the development of<br/>our 72 club :</p><p>1) it is very good 11-limit JI approximating system</p><p>2) it is a superset of ubiquitous Western music practice</p><p>3) 72 is even studied and advocated by musicians in a real<br/>   Western style conservatory</p><p>These are powerful concepts for a hoping-to-be-performed<br/>composer.</p><p>This Swiss army knife doesn&apos;t solve a lot of other problems.<br/>The best meantone in 72 is 12et, so for performing Western<br/>music written in the past 1000 years it doesn&apos;t solve the<br/>problem of how to play G B D (choices are : &quot;play it in 12&quot;,<br/>&quot;wedge in a 16c comma somewhere&quot;, &quot;adapt it beyond 72 as you<br/>adapt beyond 12 today&quot;). There is no one answer which can<br/>answer the G B D question as historically it may have meant<br/>pythagorean, meantone, etc, etc... I just don&apos;t think that<br/>72 addresses this, and perhaps its not meant to address it.</p><p>In my opinion, M3 = best(5/4) but thats probably just not<br/>going to work in 72.

But why go into<br/>&quot;tclM3&quot; when you mean &quot;just M3&quot; (where just means<br/>approximately beat-free)?
