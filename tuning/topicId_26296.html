As there<br/>are 16,384 of them available to assign, and only 5 have ever<br/>been assigned, all in the original midi spec, I suppose<br/>if one chose a large rpn like 8192, or say, a range of<br/>rpns from 8192 upwards, it is hardly likely any of them<br/>will be registered to mean anything in the very near future.</p><p>Perhaps one should hesitate about using a rpn - but doesn&apos;t<br/>seem that likely that many more will be added in the immediate<br/>future, I suppose one never knows,...</p><p>Or, possibly a nrpn? I&apos;m not sure what issues are involved<br/>in using those.</p><p>I wonder if rpns or nrpns are easier to insert than a sysex?</p><p>Just a few thoughts.</p><p>The rpns are easier to program for at low level api, as<br/>in Windows C anyway, you need to use special function<br/>calls just for sysexes (as the standard lowlevel api ones only<br/>let you send two bytes of data at a time).</p><p>Basically, you have to fill a buffer with the sysex, and<br/>then send that, and the way it is done in Windows is quite<br/>complicated.</p><p>I don&apos;t know the details as I haven&apos;t needed to do it yet.<br/>That&apos;s for midi relaying - of course they are easy to read<br/>from a midi file.</p><p>Of course that level of things doesn&apos;t affect most, as the<br/>programmer of whatever program one is<br/>using will have done it (and I&apos;m sure it won&apos;t be that<br/>hard to do if I ever do need to to it!).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
