A startling find!<br/>&gt;            From: &quot;M. Edward Borasky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:znmeb@aracnet.com">znmeb@aracnet.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: A startling find!</p><p>&gt; So ... if anyone out there had a KIM-1 and thinks this<br/>&gt; sounds familiar,<br/>&gt; please let me know ...</p><p>Sure sounds familiar. My first MIDI stuff was done on a<br/>board with similar resources but was based on 6802. Two<br/>quite elaborate algorithmic pieces were entered via hex<br/>keypad. One of these pieces &quot;Polyphonic Variations&quot; still<br/>works too &apos;cause I burnt an EPROM (the noise of an FSK<br/>cassette is like going to the dentist!) 6802 architecture is<br/>the same but has different size registers. The public-domain<br/>cross assembler I use on the MIDI Tool Box (68HC11) might<br/>allow disassembly of 6502. If you find the code and would<br/>like it dissassembled, send me the file.</p><p>Greg S</p></div>
