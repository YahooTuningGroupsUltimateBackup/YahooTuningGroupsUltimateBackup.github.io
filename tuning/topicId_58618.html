Would be less for a p.c. If you have<br/>a recent computer bought in the last year or two<br/>it will probably be fast enough.<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;120 for an external soundcard that will work with Giga.<br/>I bought it second hand &quot;As New&quot; on <a href="http://ebay.co.uk">ebay.co.uk</a></p><p>Nothing for giga itseslf as it came bundled with the soundcard<br/>in the Light Edition. The light edition is fine if ones<br/>main aim is just to be able to play them.</p><p>You can alternatively just use Virtual Sampler which will<br/>let you play gigs on any soundcard with direct sound or<br/>with Asio using the Asio4All.</p><p>Decent headphones to listen to it (cost a lot less<br/>than decent speakers). Mine are the Grado SR60 prestige<br/>which cost about &iuml;&iquest;&half;70 or so a few years ago.</p><p>Then some decent gigs. I have just got Dan Dean&apos;s solo strings<br/>as I&apos;m particularly insterested in string sounds. Doubtless<br/>I&apos;ll build on it later. But if you have a particular interest<br/>you can get gig files for that.</p><p>Of course if you want to do a complete orchestra as you did<br/>then that requires some serious outlay for the gig files.<br/>If you want to stream all the tracks for a complete<br/>orchestra at once or some such you need a fast computer<br/>with good high capacity hard disks.<br/>One can find good reasons for spending all  that you spent<br/>on it and more certainly. But for someone who wants to<br/>wet their feet and just get started with something<br/>satisfying, it isn&apos;t such a very great expense as<br/>all that.</p><p>BTW I enjoyed your piece a lot, and thanks for sharing it :-).</p><p>Robert</p><p>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t say &quot;shockingly&quot; close, but almost reasonably close these<br/>&gt; days.  And here&apos;s a very rough price list:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; $1500 modern home-built windows computer w/2 gigabytes ram, PIV 3.2, big<br/>&gt; fast disk drives, moderately good sound card<br/>&gt;   $500  gigastudio 3<br/>&gt;   $500  sequencer and audio recording software<br/>&gt; $1000 speakers for computer output<br/>&gt; $2000  ($1000-$5000, orchestral sample libraries, prices and<br/>&gt; comprehensiveness vary greatly)<br/>&gt; --------<br/>&gt; $5500  plus a LOT of time.<br/>&gt; Guglielmo</p></div>
