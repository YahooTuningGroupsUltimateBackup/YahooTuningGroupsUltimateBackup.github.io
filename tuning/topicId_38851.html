The samples sound interesting so far...I will listen to them in their entirety soon.</p><p>Yes, I had a similar reaction to the Beethoven in the Temperaments CD; the first time I listened to (parts of) it (a few years ago), I wasn&apos;t especially impressed; however, last week I listened to the whole CD and it was very remarkable. I am seriously planning to have my piano tuned in a well temperament when it&apos;s time for the next tuning. Besides the obvious (and probably positive) effect on the sound of common practice music, I am very curious how a piece like the Berg Sonata, Op. 1, would sound, as well as actual twelve-tone music (e.g. Babbitt). Perhaps not the most desirable, but I think it will be a small sacrifice in comparison to what is gained - if nothing else, for the experience of hearing something different.</p><p>I remember many of your posts to the old Classica list, which is how I first learned (in detail) of the various temperaments, although it&apos;s taken me this long to seriously consider the possibilities of tuning and microtonality as a composer. Anyway, keep up the good work - would love to see more CDs of well-tempered piano music.</p><p>Best,<br/>Marc</p></div><h3><a id=38860 href="#38860">ðŸ”—</a>Billbrpt@aol.com</h3><span>8/28/2002 3:20:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 8/27/02 9:00:57 PM Central Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:op132@bigfoot.com">op132@bigfoot.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; would love<br/>&gt; to see more CDs of well-tempered piano music.<br/>&gt;</p><p>As would I.

I have often been<br/>told by listeners that ,on first listening, there was little difference to<br/>their ear, yet after several exposures, they began to discern what is missing<br/>in the ET versions of the same pieces.    It seems that there is a process of<br/>&quot;recoupment&quot; on the sensual level that takes place with repeated exposure.<br/>This makes me wonder how much of the great piano literature&apos;s affective power<br/>has been lost by the subtle transcription into equal temperament.  It does<br/>seem that the last 100 years has seen a lessening of attraction to the great<br/>keyboard composers.  (what  does hip hop have that Haydn don&apos;t?  Is there not<br/>enought beat in Beethoven or motion in Mozart?  Get Bach, Loretta!)<br/>     The change in musical quality between tunings may be so subtle as to be<br/>easily missed on initial hearing but many of us involved in the Temperament<br/>Revival go on in the faith that there is something of exquisite value in the<br/>work of the great composers that is lost without a harmonic palette<br/>representative of their times.  Are we in the teapot?  Perhaps, but a number<br/>of events sustains us. Chiefly among them,  the response of the musicians.<br/>Even though a listener may not immediately recognize a change, the pianist is<br/>usually aware of something as soon as they touch the instrument.  How that<br/>change is received often depends on what their expectations were going into<br/>it. In this process, the tuner must become the guide, and lemme say,<br/>established ivory-tower types don&apos;t normally like to grant guide status to<br/>the &apos;tuner&apos;, but that is changing.<br/>    Whereas today, there are a great many innovators of temperament, (this<br/>list bears proof of that!),  and there is a wonderful promise of new<br/>intonational resources for today and the future in our &quot;many-N-based&quot;<br/>explorations,  the true musical architecture of Bach, Haydn, Mozart,<br/>Beethoven, etal. requires less theory than research.  We know how<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s proposals were molded into a variety of shapes by Kirnberger,<br/>Rousseau, Prelleur, Smith and Young, as well as countless others.  From our<br/>21st Century vantage point, we can see the common denominators that remained<br/>in place between 1680 and 1900 as the octave was hammered this way and that,<br/>reflecting not only pietistic desires, but supposed &quot;natural&quot; values and<br/>sought after emotional states.  The whole concept of &quot;key character&quot; lent<br/>ammo to the war between the  proponents of the &quot;intellectual&quot; and the<br/>subscribers to &quot;Ethos&quot;.<br/>    I believe that composers of the past had little to say about any given<br/>temperament du jour because the concept was universally understood. Once you<br/>got past the restrictions of Meantone, it was just a guessing game for the<br/>average choirmaster or music teacher to get the 12 notes placed so that<br/>nothing really screamed.   The basic allotment of dissonance was common<br/>enough for virtually everybody to recognize the difference in feel between a<br/>C-E third and the F#-A#.  The various divisions found between these extremes<br/>were in all probability fluid, but the overall concept of rising dissonance<br/>seems to have been shared by the vast majority of writers.<br/>      It would have been as surprising to hear George Gershwin praise<br/>equality as it would have been for Mozart to remark on key color, they just<br/>used the tools at their disposal to create something that would sell.<br/>(though, according to Schubart, there were numerous writers that did go on<br/>record as to the emotional states represented by various keys).</p><p>&gt;I am seriously planning to have my piano tuned<br/>&gt;in a well temperament when it&apos;s time for the next tuning. Besides the<br/>&gt;obvious (and probably positive) effect on the sound of common practice<br/>&gt;music, I am very curious how a piece like the Berg Sonata, Op. 1, would<br/>&gt;sound, as well as actual twelve-tone music (e.g. Babbitt). Perhaps not<br/>&gt;the most desirable, but I think it will be a small sacrifice in<br/>&gt;comparison to what is gained - if nothing else, for the experience of<br/>&gt;hearing something different.</p><p>The effect on the music depends on the performers use of the resources. As<br/>Enid Katahn has said,  &quot;Highly tempered intervals can be made to sound harsh,<br/>or they can be made to sound expressive, it depends on how you play them&quot;.<br/>   It is often best for the modern ear to make a small departure, (as well as<br/>being gentle on the piano).  For this purpose, I think a copy of the<br/>Broadwood tuning would be a wise first step.  If you would like the info for<br/>your tuner, I will be glad to send it along,(deviations from ET, in cents).<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=38884 href="#38884">ðŸ”—</a>prophecyspirit@aol.com</h3><span>9/2/2002 6:49:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 9/2/02 8:06:06 PM Central Daylight Time, <a href="mailto:a440a@aol.com">a440a@aol.com</a><br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; This makes me wonder how much of the great piano literature&apos;s affective<br/>&gt; power<br/>&gt; has been lost by the subtle transcription into equal temperament.

I<br/>agree iwth your assessment of the difference a given temperament makes in<br/>music quality.</p><p>MT is good for keys 0-2#/b, unless the B major chord is used. In which case<br/>WM is  used. WM is good also for 3-4b. When the music is in 3-4# or 5b, I use<br/>ET.</p><p>I might mention, I have a forum below that deals with just intonation, just<br/>temperament, and my organ I&apos;m building tuned to just temperament. JT is a<br/>very slight detuning of the theoretical cents valuses. This permits a<br/>practical scale, and keeps the intervals from being in phase. Intervals or<br/>chords 100% in phase sound dead. They don&apos;t occur naturally. And the major<br/>third in a tirad has a reedy quality not wanted in most music. I notice this<br/>also when singers record themselves singing in pure just major thirds.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Pauline W.

I have seen one proposal around the end of the 19th century<br/>to develop a version of the grand piano with a meantone tuning using<br/>more than 12 notes -- 31 notes per octave would give a complete<br/>circulating tuning in 1/4-comma -- but that is rather the theoretical<br/>exception that proves the rule.</p><p>Harpsichords and/or organs in meantone with 31 notes per octave were<br/>built by Nicola Vicentino (1555), and by Fabio Colonna (1618) and his<br/>colleague Scipione Stella.</p><p>Looking at the achievements of 31-note meantone in the Renaissance and<br/>Manneristic eras, and its uses in the 20th and 21st centuries<br/>(e.g. Fokker) is, of course, a different stylistic question than<br/>intonational practices of 1700-1900 on 12-note pianos.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
