Similarly to the way BP has a period of 3/1 and approximates 1:3:5:7:9, this is a 4/1-periodic linear temperament and approximates 1:4:7:10:13:16 so there&apos;s some kind of &quot;triharmony&quot; in it -- or whatever I could call it. It has two interval sizes, one being about 158 cents and another one being quite close to the usual 12-EDO semitone. The generator is ~357.076254 cents, which is the 9th root of 32/5.<br/>I think this could be a similarly interesting possibility as BP is. Unfortunately, so far I&apos;ve not found a way to easily set up the tuning in the XG format but I hope I&apos;ll think of a solution soon because, personally, I can&apos;t wait to make a new piece in it. The scale has 20 tones and looks like this:</p><p>! triharmon.scl<br/>!<br/>The triharmonic scale<br/>20<br/>!<br/>99.53378<br/>257.54248<br/>357.07625<br/>456.61003<br/>614.61873<br/>714.15251<br/>8/5<br/>971.69498<br/>1071.22876<br/>1170.76254<br/>1328.77124<br/>1428.30502<br/>5/2<br/>1685.84749<br/>1785.38127<br/>1943.38997<br/>2042.92375<br/>2142.45752<br/>2300.46622<br/>4/1</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>iranief &#x3C;carlo@seraph.it&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2008 1:14:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I was reading about the &quot;47-step, non-octave scale within the framework of the double<br/>octave&quot; by Heinz Bohlen <a href="http://members.aol.com/bpsite/pythagorean.html">http://members.aol.com/bpsite/pythagorean.html</a><br/>and I see some similarities with yours.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;Â™&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi everyone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would be very curious if someone had mentioned this before --</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2008 3:32:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>if you really look at the 12th as an interval of equivalence BP can look like this type of diamonds<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/images/BPdiamond.gif">http://anaphoria.com/images/BPdiamond.gif</a><br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/images/BPdia2.gif">http://anaphoria.com/images/BPdia2.gif</a></p><p>iranief wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was reading about the &quot;47-step, non-octave scale within the &gt; framework of the double<br/>&gt; octave&quot; by Heinz Bohlen <a href="http://members.aol.com/bpsite/pythagorean.html">http://members.aol.com/bpsite/pythagorean.html</a> &gt; &lt;<a href="http://members.aol.com/bpsite/pythagorean.html">http://members.aol.com/bpsite/pythagorean.html</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; and I see some similarities with yours.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, Petr &gt; Pa&angst;&trade;&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi everyone.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would be very curious if someone had mentioned this before --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  -- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/index.html">http://anaphoria.com/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp">http://www.kxlu.com/main/index.asp</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2008 6:12:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>iranief wrote:<br/>&gt; I was reading about the &quot;47-step, non-octave scale within the framework of the double &gt; octave&quot; by Heinz Bohlen <a href="http://members.aol.com/bpsite/pythagorean.html">http://members.aol.com/bpsite/pythagorean.html</a><br/>&gt; and I see some similarities with yours.<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;&trade;&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I would be very curious if someone had mentioned this before -- They do seem to be related.

Put your fingers on X-G-U-K or C-H-I-L to get an idea. That won&apos;t be much help until generalized keyboards are more common, but maybe someday...</p></div>
