It is virtually impossible to directly hear (especially<br/>&gt;for the non-specialist) all of the &quot;rules&quot; involved in common-practice<br/>&gt;counterpoint/harmony, and yet the application of that process creates a<br/>&gt;very compelling sort of musical effect -- full tertial harmonies,<br/>&gt;resolution of dissonances, independence of lines, and so on.</p><p>I think there&apos;s an important distinction overlooked here.  The &quot;rules&quot; of<br/>conventional theory were made up to describe music that had already been<br/>written.  The music always came first, which may explain why &quot;breaking all<br/>the rules&quot; is almost required for significant historical music.</p><p>But the rules of serialism were made up, and then music was based on them.<br/>As Carlos, Erlich, Grady and others have pointed out, you don&apos;t need cheesy<br/>rules to avoid tonal center.  And anybody who needs rules to manipulate<br/>tempo and dynamics in a random way...</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3>Erik Nauman &#x3C;ENauman@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx.xxx.xx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/1999 9:41:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Yes, they do use the techniques.<br/>&gt;I&apos;m thinking &quot;Chamber Symphony&quot; which uses<br/>&gt;all forms of row, etc.  great combinations.<br/>&gt;rick S.</p><p>One of Johnston&apos;s piano pieces, the suite or the sonata, uses serial<br/>techniques in one or two movements, on the disc played by Bush<br/>(Philip?).</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/1999 4:35:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Message text written by c. lumma</p><p>&gt;But the rules of serialism were made up, and then music was based on<br/>them.&lt;</p><p>Please let us know what those &apos;rules of serialism&apos; are.</p><p>I am aware of some ideas and conventions widely but not universally used by<br/>twelve-tone and serial composers, but have never encountered any strict<br/>rules akin to those for species counterpoint exercises or Gedalge fugues.<br/>There are many composers who work strictly within sets of rules that they<br/>have developed for a given work, but that&apos;s true for _all_ composers trying<br/>to create coherent works, regardless of the style or tradition in which<br/>they work.  While one might distinguish between those composers who<br/>consciously articulate rules and those for whom the rules remain<br/>unarticulated, and one may often wish to say that &apos;this work was<br/>over-planned&apos; or that work &apos;lacked coherence&apos;,  it&apos;s doubtful that this can<br/>be generally held to have any relevance to the comparison or evaluation of<br/>the completed works.</p></div><h3>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>5/11/1999 4:54:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Carl Lumma, TD 174.25]<br/>&gt; Like deconstruction, serialism may be cool in its own right,<br/>&gt; but nobody to my knowledge has ever come forward with any<br/>&gt; reason why serializing things should be interesting.</p><p>Are you kidding? (!!!)</p><p>There&apos;s a loooooooooooooong list of people who&apos;ve written on this.<br/>Here they come...</p><p>For starters, you might try reading Schoenberg&apos;s original essays<br/>on the subject: &apos;Composition With Twelve Tones (1)&apos; and &apos;(2)&apos;,<br/>in _Style and Idea_ [2nd ed., 1975, Faber], p 214-249.</p><p>BTW, altho the original of &apos;(1)&apos; was written in German, it was<br/>translated for a lecture given in English by Schoenberg himself,<br/>and &apos;(2)&apos; was apparently written by Schoenberg in English when<br/>he was living in Los Angeles.</p><p>(I include that comment because Daniel Wolf has criticized the<br/>fact that my knowledge of Schoenberg is based almost entirely<br/>on English sources.)</p><p>*The* follow-up would be Webern&apos;s _The Path to the New Music_,<br/>taken from notes from his 1932-33 lectures, published by<br/>Universal Edition. (English version distributed by Theodore<br/>Presser - right here in our own Pennsylvania!)</p><p>This could be followed by the many writings of Babbitt, Forte,<br/>Lewin, etc. etc.  Look into any 1970s or 1980s issue of<br/>_Journal of Music Theory_ or _Perpectives of New Music_.</p><p>A few specific recommendations:</p><p>These four papers are from<br/>_Perspectives on Contemporary Music Theory_ [1972, W.
