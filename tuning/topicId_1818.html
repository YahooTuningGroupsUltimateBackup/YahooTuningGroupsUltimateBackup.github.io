Then consonance could be expressed simply as 1/d, dissonance<br/>as d.</p><p>This leads to results that are a bit uncoventional. Ratios of high numbers<br/>have high consonance when d is low. But these are supportable when heard<br/>away from the background noise of existing repertoire.</p><p>Of course, it can&apos;t be all that easy. The frequency-dependent factors<br/>(roughness, span/remoteness) require a supplemental calculation, as would<br/>tolerance*.  But dyads seem to be straightforward, with several plausible<br/>measures floating around; the &quot;holy grail&quot; for tuning theory will be a<br/>workable theory for all n-ads.</p><p>This does not mean that I am giving up on complexity measures based on<br/>factoring. After tolerance is taken into account, I suspect that factoring<br/>will play a role in measuring consonance at the triad and higher n-ad<br/>level. The complexity of lattice moves largely define the identity and<br/>coherence of harmonic and melodic progressions. Then there is the role of<br/>factoring in the perception of complex rhythms, but that&apos;s a topic for<br/>another list... (is there an &apos;alternative rhythms list&apos; out there?).</p><p>------<br/>* to which Barlow&apos;s scale step property should be added (where the<br/>acceptance of one interval identity does not conflict with the<br/>identification of other scale members).</p></div><h3><a id=1835 href="#1835">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/1999 4:06:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Wolf &lt;<a href="mailto:DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com">DJWOLF_MATERIAL@compuserve.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;I made a series of WAV files with sawtooth waveforms and a smooth envelope<br/>&gt;in the following series of intervals, with the lower tone set to 200, 300<br/>&gt;and 400 Hz:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;(0/0  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ----  ----  ----  ----  ---)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ---  2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 5/1, 6/1, 7/1, 8/1, 9/1, 10/1, 11/1, 12/1, 13/1, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           3/2, ---  5/2, ---  7/2, ---  9/2, ----  11/2, ----  13/2, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                4/3, 5/3, ---  7/3, 8/3, ---  10/3, 11/3, ----  13/3, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                     5/4, ---  7/4, ---  9/4, ----  11/4, ----  13/4, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                         6/5,  7/5, 8/5, 9/5, ----  11/5, 12/5, 13/5, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                               7/6, ---  ---  ----  11/6, ----  13/6, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                    8/7, 9/7, 10/7, 11/7, 12/7, 13/7, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                         9/8, ----  11/8, ----  13/8, ...<br/>&gt;                                               ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Please try this for yourselves!

I expect you still to experience no change in<br/>dissonance across each row and an increase with increasing denominator d.<br/>But then we realise that the interval 2/3 is exactly the same size as the<br/>interval 3/2 etc. They are the same interval. And yet we have decided that<br/>2/3 is more dissonant than 3/2. A contradiction? No. Paul Erlich has<br/>already explained this, although I think the full implications have not<br/>been appreciated.</p><p>Those who say dissonance is proportional to d are keeping the lower<br/>frequency constant. If you keep the higher freq constant then it&apos;s<br/>proportional to n (when the fraction is in the usual improper form (n&gt;d)).<br/>Those who say n+d (or (n+d)/2) are comparing intervals about roughly the<br/>same center.</p><p>This implies that lower frequencies are inherently more dissonant than<br/>higher ones. To use n+d is just to remove the effect of the average<br/>frequency on dissonance, and just leave that which depends on the ratio<br/>itself.</p><p>Thanks Dan, for helping to make this clearer.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=1875 href="#1875">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

It was adapted from the appendix of Van Eck&apos;s _J. S.<br/>Bach&apos;s Critique of Pure Music_; I had to correct an error in that and<br/>proceed from there on my own. My harmonic entropy model is based on<br/>exactly the same framework as this derivation, with the additional<br/>assumptions (also taken from Van Eck) that one&apos;s perception of an<br/>interval is &quot;blurred&quot;, that this blurring takes the form of a Guassian<br/>probability distrubution centered around the actual interval, and that<br/>the probability of a given just interpretation of the interval is the<br/>area under the Gaussian between the mediants between that just interval<br/>and its neighbors in the Farey series. My only original contribution was<br/>to propose calculating the entropy of the probability distribution<br/>(defined as -sum(p*log(p))) as a measure of dissonance.</p><p>Basically the derivation was a proof (original to me) that the<br/>(log-frequency) distance between the mediants between a just interval<br/>and its neighbors in the Farey series, assuming the numbers making up<br/>the just interval are much smaller than the order of the Farey series,<br/>is inversely proportional to the denominator of the just interval. In<br/>particular, the width is approximately equal to 2/Nd, where d is the<br/>denominator and N is the order of the Farey series. (BTW, if d is not<br/>small compared to N, then the actual width may be as small as 1/Nd, but<br/>never exceeds 2/Nd).</p><p>Daniel, when I posted that long, complicated derivation, it was part of<br/>a discussion I was having with you.
