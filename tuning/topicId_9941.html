The book is called<br/>&quot;Traditional Persian Art Music: The Radif of Mirza Abdollah&quot;.  I ordered<br/>mine a couple of months ago (before it was available), and it just<br/>arrived yesterday.</p><p>The book includes a little information about Persian tunings (giving<br/>both a subset of 24 TET and an alternative tuning and explaining that<br/>neither is completely satisfactory -- hence the moveable frets of the<br/>tar and sehtar).  :-)</p><p>The book also describes the combinations of different tetrachords used<br/>in Persian music.</p><p>Here&apos;s a description of it from Mazda Publishers&apos; web page:</p><p><a href="http://www.mazdapub.com/Traditional-Music.htm">http://www.mazdapub.com/Traditional-Music.htm</a><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   This volume ... is a book of musical notation of the Persian<br/>   classical music repertory, the radif, as handed down by the<br/>   nineteenth-century master of the setar and tar, Mirza Abdollah, to<br/>   his students and children, along with a concise explanation of his<br/>   music. The book&apos;s musical notation and the explanatory material are<br/>   written by Dariush Tala&apos;i. He has transcribed his entire performance<br/>   into musical notation so that a person who reads music can see<br/>   exactly what is being performed. Information is given in the<br/>   notations about fingering on the setar, how to pluck the instrument,<br/>   and what ornamentation to use. The accompanying written materials<br/>   will provide information about the radif, the modal system, and a<br/>   concise description of the characteristics of each of the two major<br/>   parts of the radif.</p><p>   About the Compact Discs<br/>   This volume is accompanied by a set of 5 compact discs (CDs) with the<br/>   complete radif performed by setar virtuoso, Dariush Tala&apos;i. The<br/>   recordings were made at the University of Washington in Seattle in<br/>   1992 while Mr. Tala&apos;i was a Visiting Professor in the School of<br/>   Music.</p><p>   Specifications:<br/>   1999: ix+597pp., includes 5 compact discs.<br/>   Bibliotheca Iranica: Performing Arts Series No. 3<br/>   ISBN:1-56859-039-3(hard cover book+ 5 CDs):$95.00<br/>   ISBN:1-56859-073-3 (CDs only): $65.00<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div>
