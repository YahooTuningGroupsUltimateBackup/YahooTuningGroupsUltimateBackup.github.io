I have wondered if we were all to<br/>begin a relentless letter writing campaign to them if they would<br/>start to offer more products that would fit our specific needs.</p><p>Any thoughts on this? I really believe that it could be effective in<br/>the long run if we were to let them know that there are many<br/>composers, producers, performers and educators that would like to see<br/>positive growth toward better tunable products. If we can form a<br/>consensus on this you can count me in! Hey - what many are there here<br/>now - about 400 of us? That&apos;s allot of letters! If we bombard those<br/>Inboxes we CAN effect some change! Of course we can just choose to<br/>sit back and whine about what&apos;s lacking in the current crop of<br/>keyboards, and things may go on &quot;as is&quot; until interest wanes out<br/>there.</p><p>Let me know what you think. Perhaps if enough of us are interested in<br/>this it could become a mission of sorts for us all, so that maybe our<br/>grandchildren will have better instruments to carry on our tradition<br/>with.</p><p>Good Day!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
