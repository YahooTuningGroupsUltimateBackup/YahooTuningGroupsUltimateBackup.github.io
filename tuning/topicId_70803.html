So if you own one of these synths<br/>or are thinking of picking one up, here&apos;s what you do:</p><p>1. Download and install g2ools.  Download location and instructions<br/>for installation are here:</p><p><a href="http://electro-music.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15405">http://electro-music.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=15405</a></p><p>2. Download the new Scala-loading-and-conversion tool from here and<br/>follow the instructions:<br/><a href="http://electro-music.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10387&start=25">http://electro-music.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10387&start=25</a><br/>(Look for <a href="http://G2SCL.zip">G2SCL.zip</a>)</p><p>The forum thread in #2 above also has posted sample patches tuned to<br/>Fokker and Meantone.  The author says he generated those off of Scala<br/>files using the new tool.</p><p>3.
