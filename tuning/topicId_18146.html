Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/2001 3:31:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Graham Breed and everyone, and please let me acknowledge<br/>my real doubts about my ability to do full justice in replying to your<br/>response at once rich with practical experience and offering a wealth<br/>of new ideas with a relevance going far beyond the rather specialized<br/>area of neo-Gothic music.</p><p>Your article (TD 1068:19) spurred me on to a post about 2-3-7<br/>optimizations and neo-Gothic cadences in meantone, but that doesn&apos;t begin<br/>to respond to all your valuable observations, many relating to themes such<br/>as 11-limit harmony about which others can comment with a better basis in<br/>theory and practice.</p><p>Your 41-note well-temperament looks to me like an idea whose time has<br/>come, most appropriately at the opening of a new millennium. I hope<br/>that others will join the dialogue, for example John deLaubenfels with<br/>his enthusiasm for 11-limit and 13-limit harmony.</p><p>Here I&apos;ll try mainly to acknowledge some very valuable contributions<br/>you&apos;re made, for example in clarifying the matter of &quot;septimal<br/>schisma&quot; terminology, and to respond a bit further on your points<br/>about optimization and neo-Gothic music in meantone.</p><p>However, this remains a very partial reply to ideas which I hope may<br/>gain much attention and a receptive response from the alternative<br/>tuning community at large, on this List and elsewhere.</p><p>&gt; And that&apos;s another thing.  When you take the 5s out, this is *the*<br/>&gt; septimal schisma.  To reflect this, I suggest it be called the<br/>&gt; &quot;Pythagorean-septimal schisma&quot; or &quot;2-3-7 schisma&quot;.</p><p>This is an excellent point, and you&apos;ve convinced me that &quot;2-3-7<br/>schisma&quot; is an ideal term because it communicates that we are talking<br/>about the difference between the 2-3 or Pythagorean comma and the 3-7<br/>or septimal comma. I really like it!</p><p>We could call the familiar schisma of ~1.95 cents the &quot;2-3-5 schisma,&quot;<br/>and maybe the schisma at 5120:5103 the &quot;3-5-7 schisma.&quot;</p><p>&gt; But I find it conceptually easier to explain a temperament without<br/>&gt; using the complicated &quot;bridge&quot; intervals.  I think of schismic<br/>&gt; temperament as being about commas.  In the 5-limit case, the<br/>&gt; Pythagorean and syntonic commas are equivalent.  The septimal comma<br/>&gt; 64:63 then joins the party.  If 81:80 decides to leave, that&apos;s no<br/>&gt; problem!</p><p>With the 2-3-7 JI scheme, we could define it without using schismas at<br/>all: it&apos;s simply two 12-note keyboards in Pythagorean tuning (Eb-G#) a<br/>septimal comma apart.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t even know the ratio for a Pythagorean comma offhand.  I<br/>&gt; could work it out, of course.  But all I need to know it that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; the amount by which 6 whole tones of 9:8 are sharp of a 2:1 octave.</p><p>In fact, that&apos;s one of the ways that Jacobus of Liege presents the<br/>idea of the Pythagorean comma around 1325: six whole-tones of 9:8 give<br/>us an interval called the _hexatonus_, _not_ equal to a pure octave.<br/>The ratio of the comma is 531441:524288 (~23.46 cents).</p><p>Using the more modern device of rounded cents, we can approximate this<br/>by reasoning that if 9:8 is about 204 cents, then six of these<br/>whole-tones will be around 1224 cents -- a comma of about 24 cents. If<br/>we take the 9:8 more accurately at 203.91 cents, then we get six of<br/>these tones at 1223.46 cents -- and the comma at 23.46 cents, as<br/>accurate an approximation as we&apos;re likely to need.</p><p>Curiously, this tends to get rounded off as 24 cents rather than the<br/>slightly closer 23 cents, maybe a psychological and practical<br/>attraction of an approximation in cents divisible by various<br/>integers.</p><p>&gt; In the same way, 12-equal is the borderline between meantone and<br/>&gt; schismic temperaments.  So &quot;meantone&quot; would usually refer to scales<br/>&gt; generated by a fifth flatter than 7/12 octaves (although the<br/>&gt; definition is contentious :) and &quot;schismic&quot; to those with fifths<br/>&gt; sharp of 5/12 octaves.</p><p>Here I tend to use the term &quot;negative tunings&quot; for those with fifths<br/>smaller than 700 cents, including historical meantones; and &quot;positive<br/>tunings&quot; for those with fifths larger than 700 cents, including what I<br/>tend to consider a rather small subset of &quot;schismic temperaments.&quot;</p><p>However, your idea of a &quot;schismic&quot; temperament or tuning may be much<br/>broader than mine because you&apos;re dealing with 11-limit harmony where<br/>there may be more schismas to consider.</p><p>To me, a &quot;schismic temperament&quot; has the rather narrow meaning of a<br/>tuning where the fifth is very slightly tempered to disperse either<br/>the 2-3-5 schisma (e.g. Helmholtz/Ellis 1/8-skhisma, as they spell it,<br/>with pure 5:4 thirds; or Sa/bat 1/9-schisma with pure 6:5 thirds); or<br/>the 2-3-7 schisma (1/14-schisma for pure 7:4; 1/15-schisma for 7:6;<br/>1/16-schisma for 9:7).</p><p>Additionally, there are &quot;schismic untemperaments&quot; such as two 12-note<br/>keyboards a 3-7 or septimal comma apart (my 2-3-7 scheme), or a 3-5 or<br/>syntonic comma apart, 81:80 or ~23.46 cents (for pure 2-3-5 ratios).</p><p>Of course, since you&apos;re dealing with more factors like 11, you have a<br/>wider range of schismas and schismic temperaments to consider.</p><p>Let&apos;s discuss this more, because it gets into some fascinating<br/>questions of 21st-century terminology where either 11-limit harmony or<br/>neo-Gothic polyphony may call for a real reappraisal of 19th-century<br/>concepts such as &quot;positive/negative&quot; or &quot;schismic&quot; tunings.</p><p>&gt; If I remember these, I could try them.  Although the difference<br/>&gt; between 1/14 and 1/15 schisma is likely to be much smaller than<br/>&gt; between either and Pythagorean intonation.  12:18 and 14:21 are<br/>&gt; both fifths, right?  And 12:14 is 6:7.  So these are fifth pairs a<br/>&gt; subminor third apart.</p><p>That&apos;s correct, and in the 2-3-7 system that is how they are played: a<br/>fifth on each keyboard, for example 12:14:18:21 as E^3-G3-B^3-D4.</p><p>Also, in the most typical resolution, those two fifths proceed by<br/>parallel motion, while the unstable 7-based intervals resolve by<br/>contrary motion. This may be simplest in a 22-tET spelling, where all<br/>these are regular intervals, and I&apos;ll also give it in my 2-3-7 JI<br/>spelling:</p><p>D4 C4       D4  C4<br/>B4 C4       B^3 C4<br/>G3 F4       G3  F3<br/>E3 F3       E^3 F3</p><p>22-tET     2-3-7 JI</p><p>&gt; Usually I go with a 4:5:6:7 for testing, or 4:5:6:7:8 if my fingers<br/>&gt; stretch far enough.</p><p>For 7-limit, that seems a natural choice.</p><p>&gt; I think a lot of the neo-Gothic concepts would work in meantone.<br/>&gt; You still have good-enough approximations to the 2-3-7 intervals.</p><p>Certainly, and I might add that 2-3-7 is only one side of neo-Gothic.<br/>For example, from a 2-3-7 viewpoint, the diminished fourth in<br/>1/4-comma at around 427 cents isn&apos;t an especially accurate 9:7; but<br/>it&apos;s a perfectly fine neo-Gothic major third, somewhere between 17-tET<br/>and 39-tET.</p><p>In fact, a major third of almost identical size occurs in a neo-Gothic<br/>JI tuning I came up a few months ago based on pure 3:2 fifths and<br/>14:11 major thirds. It&apos;s a 14:11 plus two commas of 896:891, the<br/>amount by which the 14:11 exceeds the Pythagorean major third at 81:64<br/>(about 9.69 cents).</p><p>As I discuss in the optimization article, if we want to combine<br/>Renaissance and neo-Gothic styles in a single piece based on a single<br/>tuning, then meantone is an _ideal_ solution, because for the<br/>Renaissance sonorities we want those thirds close to pure ratios of 5.</p><p>For this I would go with two manuals in 1/4-comma tuning a diesis<br/>apart, a favorite tuning of mine for &quot;Xeno-Renaissance&quot; generally. In<br/>effect, it&apos;s a subset of Vicentino&apos;s 31-note meantone cycle on his<br/>archicembalo of 1555.</p><p>&gt; It happens that 1/4-comma meantone is both the optimal minimax<br/>&gt; 5-limit temperament, and the same optimum for the 7-limit.  So there<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t the 7-5 dichotomy you get in schismic temperament where the<br/>&gt; two are optimised either side of Pythagorean.  However, in meantone,<br/>&gt; the fifths are always bad relative to schismic if you optimize to<br/>&gt; either of these limits.</p><p>Once we modify the 2-3-7 optimization question by bringing ratios of 5<br/>into it, I would say that meantone has the very important practical<br/>advantage of giving us 5-limit thirds as regular intervals filling the<br/>keyboard at the usual places.</p><p>A significant distinction: in neo-Gothic, &quot;7-flavor&quot; for me includes<br/>the 9:7; but for many people &quot;7-limit&quot; means 7-odd, not including the<br/>9:7 major third. If we&apos;re optimizing 2-3-5-7, not including the 9:7,<br/>then I agree that meantone is comparably accurate for 5 and 7.</p><p>For a near-Pythagorean 2-3-5-7 solution (with or without 9:7), one<br/>strategy might be to tune a fifth around 702.04 cents (~0.08 cents<br/>wide), at which point ratios of 5 and 7 alike should be within about<br/>2.72 cents of pure (5:4, 6:5, 7:4, 7:6, 9:7). The idea is balance out<br/>the 2-3-5 schisma (~1.95 cents) and the 2-3-7 schisma (~3.80 cents) so<br/>that 5-based and 7-based intervals are impure by about the same<br/>amount.</p><p>&gt; I think the fifths in, say, 31-equal are good enough for trines to<br/>&gt; function as stable chords.  I find the tempering to be noticeable<br/>&gt; but tolerable.  7-based chords should be able to resolve onto trines<br/>&gt; the same as they do in a schismic temperament.</p><p>Certainly I&apos;d agree: neo-Gothic progressions are recognizable,<br/>acceptable, and intriguing in 1/4-comma meantone with the fifths<br/>around 5.38 cents narrow; in 22-tET with the fifths around 7.14 cents<br/>wide, a yet greater compromise; or, with the right timbres, in 20-tET<br/>with trines at 0-720-1200 cents.</p><p>While Vicentino didn&apos;t design his archicembalo to play neo-Gothic<br/>progressions, a 24-note version of his 38-note design makes these<br/>intervals quite conveniently available -- about as simply or<br/>intricately as one of my usual 24-note neo-Gothic tunings for ratios<br/>of 2-3-7. There are a couple of examples in my post on neo-Gothic<br/>progressions in meantone.</p><p>Also, from an historical point of view, I&apos;d very much want to confirm<br/>your point that meantone fifths are still stable concords, and can be<br/>more conclusive than thirds in much early Renaissance keyboard music.</p><p>During the first epoch of meantone, say 1450-1500, thirds and sixths<br/>were still typically considered &quot;not-quite-conclusive&quot; intervals, with<br/>lots of cadences on sonorities identical to medieval trines. If fifths<br/>weren&apos;t stable concords in meantone, there would have been lots of<br/>problems.</p><p>In playing some Spanish vocal music around 1500 on a meantone<br/>keyboard, I like the way that concluding fifth-plus-octave sonorities<br/>(the term &quot;trine&quot; sounds a bit medievalistic for this Renaissance era)<br/>have a bit of &quot;bounce.&quot; Of course, meantone optimizes the sonorities<br/>with thirds and sixths at most other points.</p><p>Also, 16th-century keyboard composers like Cabezon use lots of<br/>sonorities with fifths and no thirds, and the tempering is no problem<br/>at all for me. Mark Lindley likes the effect of these meantone fifths<br/>in the lute music of Milan from around the 1530&apos;s, and finds this<br/>tuning more pleasing than 12-tET (which theorists report was becoming<br/>standard on the lute by around the middle of the century).</p><p>For neo-Gothic music, I would say that 1/4-comma meantone has fifths<br/>tempered rather more heavily than in what I would consider the most<br/>characteristic tunings (roughly Pythagorean to 17-tET), but<br/>considerably less than in 22-tET, let along 20-tET. It&apos;s one more<br/>alternative, and a very creative one.</p><p>&gt; The near-pure thirds are something of a red-herring.  Yes, either<br/>&gt; 5:4 or 6:5 can be pure in meantone, but so can either 7:6 or 7:4.<br/>&gt; The trade-off between meantone and schismic is the same whether you<br/>&gt; take 2-3-5 or 2-3-7.  Schismic temperament will give you much purer<br/>&gt; intervals, but with a more complex scale.</p><p>Here I might agree with what you say while stating it a bit<br/>differently from my point of view: a quasi-Pythagorean tuning fills<br/>the keyboard manuals with regular Pythagorean-like intervals, and<br/>meantone with regular meantone intervals.</p><p>For neo-Gothic music, I find that the Pythagorean and 7-based<br/>intervals form a very nice and happy family, so that in effect a<br/>24-note tuning for 2-3-7 JI gives me a regular Pythagorean scale plus<br/>the special &quot;7-flavor&quot; steps, plus the ideal optimization.</p><p>For Renaissance music, meantone gives regular 5-limit intervals of a<br/>conventional 16th-century style plus the 7-based intervals and other<br/>treats such as near-11:9 neutral thirds (regarded as consonances by<br/>Vicentino, who, however, found the near-7:6 and near-7:4 as leaning<br/>toward dissonance, along with the near-9:7).</p><p>With either system, and I&apos;d tune either in 24 notes, our 7-based<br/>intervals are something other than regular thirds, sixths, and<br/>sevenths, etc.</p><p>For a 2-3-7 approximation with real simplicity, I&apos;d go for 22-tET,<br/>where a 9:7 is a regular major third of four fifths up, etc., although<br/>this is overall less accurate than either more intricate system --<br/>with the fifth notably tempered more heavily than in meantone!</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m interested in how neo-Gothic would work in meantone.  I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; followed the details of the theory as you outlined it.  I tend to<br/>&gt; switch off when I see harmonic progressions discussed, because I&apos;m<br/>&gt; not familiar with the traditional theory.  Perhaps a summary of<br/>&gt; characteristic progressions would be useful, or I could go back<br/>&gt; through the archives.</p><p>In my longer post, I give a few examples, including some which can be<br/>played on a usual 12-note meantone keyboard with a range of Eb-G#.</p><p>Please let me maybe reassure you on one point about neo-Gothic music:<br/>it doesn&apos;t really fit traditional theory as many people define it,<br/>based mostly on 18th-19th century European harmony. It&apos;s more like<br/>13th-14th century European theory, something quite different, with a<br/>very different set of progressions.</p><p>Why don&apos;t I give URL&apos;s for my &quot;Gentle introduction to neo-Gothic<br/>progressions,&quot; and invite your questions or feedback. One thing I<br/>tried to do was to explain some of the style without assuming<br/>familiarity with medieval theory, but only readers can say how closely<br/>I approached this ideal:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_15038.html#15038">/tuning/topicId_15038.html#15038</a>  (1/Pt 1)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15630.html#15630">/tuning/topicId_15630.html#15630</a>  (1/Pt 2A)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_15685.html#15685">/tuning/topicId_15685.html#15685</a>  (1/Pt 2B)<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_16134.html#16134">/tuning/topicId_16134.html#16134</a>  (1/Pt 2C)</p><p>&gt; If enough intervals with 7 and 11 are involved, it may be possible<br/>&gt; to remove the Pythagorean ones altogether.  So an 11-limit aware<br/>&gt; meantone notation could be used for variable pitched instruments.</p><p>From a neo-Gothic perspective, I want very much to keep those<br/>Pythagorean intervals, which nicely contrast with the 7-based ones to<br/>make a happy family; but for 11-limit styles, meantone could be the<br/>ideal choice.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m also wondering how much Common Practice harmony could work with<br/>&gt; 9-limit intervals.  The occasional 6:7:9 minor triad, or 21:20<br/>&gt; leading tone, could do it a power of good.</p><p>Someone more informed about common practice -- &quot;key-based era,&quot; I<br/>might say, basically Corelli-Wagner or the like (say 1680-1900) --<br/>might have better answers, and I suspect that John deLaubenfels might<br/>be very supportive of this approach, since he loves the 6:7:9 for<br/>settings of music from this era. It&apos;s interesting how these 7-based or<br/>higher ratios can apply to different kinds of styles.</p><p>&gt; Ah, right.  So this is like a well-temperament for schismic scales.<br/>&gt; As such, it would favor some keys over others.  Although mostly,<br/>&gt; yes, likely a conceptual difference.</p><p>Technically, yes, we could call RAST (Rational Adaptive Schisma<br/>Tuning) with two Pythagorean keyboards a septimal comma apart a<br/>&quot;well-temperament&quot; in the sense that G#-D# is a 3.80-cent septimal<br/>schisma wider than pure, with the other 22 fifths all pure.</p><p>Within the base range of Eb-G#, it&apos;s a JI system for pure ratios of<br/>2-3-7 (ratios of 7 formed from 14, 15, or 16 fifths up or down).</p><p>However, for Pythagorean-like intervals in the more remote part of the<br/>gamut including the wide, 17-tET-like fifth in their chains, it is a<br/>subtle kind of well-temperament, with such intervals altered by the<br/>3.80-cent schisma. For example, the major third F#-A# (or F#-Bb^ in my<br/>keyboard notation) is enlarged from a usual Pythagorean 81:64 (~407.82<br/>cents) to around 411.62 cents, or a bit more than halfway to 29-tET.</p><p>Using my 2-3-7 schisma notation, I&apos;d write this F#-A#&apos;, with the<br/>apostrophe (&apos;) showing a note raised by a 2-3-7 schisma from its usual<br/>Pythagorean position.</p><p>Here I might do well to add that for many people a &quot;well-temperament&quot;<br/>implies circulation, which for this scheme would call for 106 notes;<br/>but certainly the 24-note version involves a slight shift of &quot;color&quot;<br/>for some more remote intervals because of the one 17-tET-like fifth.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Of course, as the phrase goes, this is a &quot;device-specific&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; issue. If we had a synthesizer in 1350-tET, then a regular<br/>&gt;&gt; 1/14-schisma temperament with all fifths at 790 units would be<br/>&gt;&gt; the way to go.</p><p>&gt; You only need 135-tET for that.</p><p>Of course you&apos;re right, and I may have indulged in a bit of overly<br/>obscure humor by picturing a new synthesizer standard dividing each<br/>135-tET step into ten equal parts, or 1350-tET, for a resolution a bit<br/>better than one cent.</p><p>By the way, on your point regarding precision vs. accuracy, I wonder<br/>if there have been any accuracy tests on sythesizers by microtonal<br/>advocates.</p><p>&gt; 12 note well temperaments work as they do because some parts of the<br/>&gt; keyboard favour thirds, and some fifths.  This compromise comes from<br/>&gt; the ideal tunings for 3:2 and 5:4 being either side of 12-equal.  In<br/>&gt; the same way, a 41 note RAST might balance the 3 and 7 on one side,<br/>&gt; and the 11 on the other.  Perhaps you could look at this in the<br/>&gt; light of your theories.  (Or perhaps you already have.)</p><p>Actually, my first impressions is that this looks like a great idea<br/>which is a bit outside of usual neo-Gothic theory, but potentially a<br/>most creative solution for 11-limit musics.</p><p>For example, in neo-Gothic, a 24-note e-based tuning at ~704.61 cents<br/>optimizes the ratios of 2-3-7, 11:7, and 11:8 _as they&apos;re typically<br/>used in this musical style_, but not necessarily as they&apos;d be used in<br/>11-limit. The 11:8, for example, is a kind of special &quot;Wolf fourth&quot;<br/>occurring between a diminished fourth and major sixth of a sonority<br/>expanding to a trine like a usual major sixth sonority:</p><p>G#4 A4<br/>Eb4 E4<br/>B3  A3</p><p>In an 11-limit system of harmony, I suspect that these intervals might<br/>be used in quite different ways, and that the e-based temperament<br/>might be much less relevant than your neat 41-note well-temperament<br/>idea, which looks really worthwhile to me in theory and practice.</p><p>Please let me conclude by saying that such a well-temperament could be<br/>relevant to various musics, and has very much a &quot;21st-century&quot; ring to<br/>it.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=18169 href="#18169">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>1/31/2001 11:15:13 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t even know the ratio for a Pythagorean comma offhand.

The 5-limit approximation provides<br/>the real definition, like with meantone.  The 7-limit approximation is<br/>fairly consistent in both, unlike the 22, 34, 46, ... family. In this<br/>context, the 7-limit takes center stage.  So 118-equal is schismic,<br/>but not &quot;septimal schismic&quot;.</p><p>&gt; To me, a &quot;schismic temperament&quot; has the rather narrow meaning of a<br/>&gt; tuning where the fifth is very slightly tempered to disperse either<br/>&gt; the 2-3-5 schisma (e.g. Helmholtz/Ellis 1/8-skhisma, as they spell<br/>it,<br/>&gt; with pure 5:4 thirds; or Sa/bat 1/9-schisma with pure 6:5 thirds);<br/>or<br/>&gt; the 2-3-7 schisma (1/14-schisma for pure 7:4; 1/15-schisma for 7:6;<br/>&gt; 1/16-schisma for 9:7).</p><p>That&apos;s the one.  It&apos;s implicit in Arabic music as well.  I worked it<br/>out from one of the files in Manuel&apos;s archive that is written in<br/>Pythagorean, but turns out to be suspiciously close to a JI diatonic<br/>scale.</p><p>&gt; Additionally, there are &quot;schismic untemperaments&quot; such as two<br/>12-note<br/>&gt; keyboards a 3-7 or septimal comma apart (my 2-3-7 scheme), or a 3-5<br/>or<br/>&gt; syntonic comma apart, 81:80 or ~23.46 cents (for pure 2-3-5 ratios).</p><p>The schismic nature of these tunings is compelling, so they do belong<br/>under that umbrella even though they aren&apos;t temperements.  Getting<br/>intervals so close to just leads to the temptation to make them just.<br/> So if the logic of the keyboard is</p><p>&gt; Of course, since you&apos;re dealing with more factors like 11, you have<br/>a<br/>&gt; wider range of schismas and schismic temperaments to consider.<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s discuss this more, because it gets into some fascinating<br/>&gt; questions of 21st-century terminology where either 11-limit harmony<br/>or<br/>&gt; neo-Gothic polyphony may call for a real reappraisal of 19th-century<br/>&gt; concepts such as &quot;positive/negative&quot; or &quot;schismic&quot; tunings.</p><p>In the 11-limit, it makes less sense to think of positive scales as a<br/>coherent system.  The mechanics of keyboard mappings can be<br/>generalized, but the 11-limit intervals have to be thrown in ad-hoc.<br/>I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any &quot;grand unified theory&quot; that covers 41, 29,<br/>22, 46 and 17-equal, all of which work with some 11-limit intervals in<br/>their own special way.</p><p>The full 11-limit does tend towards equal temperaments.  There are so<br/>many compromises, and the intervals get so complex, that you may as<br/>well simplify it all by collapsing the tuning into one dimension.  The<br/>exception is that gift of a 2-3-6-11 approximation, which is almost<br/>just but does need a lot of fifths to work.</p><p>However, you can invent new temperaments based on different subsets of<br/>the 11-limit.  The only ones I&apos;ve found so far are the &quot;neutral third<br/>scales&quot;.  They also have counterparts in Arabic music, and are<br/>mentioned in that Carey/Clampitt paper that came out around when I was<br/>looking at them.  I explain them at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/7plus3.htm">http://x31eq.com/7plus3.htm</a>&gt;.  The idea is that a perfect<br/>fifth divides into two equal thirds, which can be identified with<br/>11:9.  You get a 7-note scale coming out, that fits the ETs 10, 17,<br/>24, 31, 38, etc and 41.  It also happens that, whereas the 2-3-11<br/>approximation is common to the system, there are different mappings to<br/>7 and 5.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think a lot of the neo-Gothic concepts would work in meantone.<br/>&gt; &gt; You still have good-enough approximations to the 2-3-7 intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly, and I might add that 2-3-7 is only one side of<br/>neo-Gothic.<br/>&gt; For example, from a 2-3-7 viewpoint, the diminished fourth in<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma at around 427 cents isn&apos;t an especially accurate 9:7; but<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a perfectly fine neo-Gothic major third, somewhere between<br/>17-tET<br/>&gt; and 39-tET.</p><p>It&apos;s good enough for a 6:7:9 chord to work.  The inverse, &quot;major&quot;<br/>chord sound distinctly automitive, but perhaps it does in JI as well.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It happens that 1/4-comma meantone is both the optimal minimax<br/>&gt; &gt; 5-limit temperament, and the same optimum for the 7-limit.  So<br/>there<br/>&gt; &gt; isn&apos;t the 7-5 dichotomy you get in schismic temperament where the<br/>&gt; &gt; two are optimised either side of Pythagorean.  However, in<br/>meantone,<br/>&gt; &gt; the fifths are always bad relative to schismic if you optimize to<br/>&gt; &gt; either of these limits.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Once we modify the 2-3-7 optimization question by bringing ratios<br/>of 5<br/>&gt; into it, I would say that meantone has the very important practical<br/>&gt; advantage of giving us 5-limit thirds as regular intervals filling<br/>the<br/>&gt; keyboard at the usual places.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A significant distinction: in neo-Gothic, &quot;7-flavor&quot; for me includes<br/>&gt; the 9:7; but for many people &quot;7-limit&quot; means 7-odd, not including<br/>the<br/>&gt; 9:7 major third. If we&apos;re optimizing 2-3-5-7, not including the 9:7,<br/>&gt; then I agree that meantone is comparably accurate for 5 and 7.</p><p>Yes, I used a sleight of hand to bring &quot;7-limit&quot; tuning into<br/>contention.  Meantones aren&apos;t as good in the full 9-limit, but the<br/>optimum is around the same point, as discussed in the other thread.</p><p>&gt; For a near-Pythagorean 2-3-5-7 solution (with or without 9:7), one<br/>&gt; strategy might be to tune a fifth around 702.04 cents (~0.08 cents<br/>&gt; wide), at which point ratios of 5 and 7 alike should be within about<br/>&gt; 2.72 cents of pure (5:4, 6:5, 7:4, 7:6, 9:7). The idea is balance<br/>out<br/>&gt; the 2-3-5 schisma (~1.95 cents) and the 2-3-7 schisma (~3.80 cents)<br/>so<br/>&gt; that 5-based and 7-based intervals are impure by about the same<br/>&gt; amount.</p><p>Oh no!  I&apos;ve been into this before.  For whatever reason, balancing 5<br/>and 7 doesn&apos;t work.  So you optimize for 7, and let 5 take care of<br/>itself.</p><p>&gt; During the first epoch of meantone, say 1450-1500, thirds and sixths<br/>&gt; were still typically considered &quot;not-quite-conclusive&quot; intervals,<br/>with<br/>&gt; lots of cadences on sonorities identical to medieval trines. If<br/>fifths<br/>&gt; weren&apos;t stable concords in meantone, there would have been lots of<br/>&gt; problems.</p><p>So this was a crossover period, which in retrospect looks like a<br/>mixture of Medieval and more modern harmony?</p><p>&gt; Also, 16th-century keyboard composers like Cabezon use lots of<br/>&gt; sonorities with fifths and no thirds, and the tempering is no<br/>problem<br/>&gt; at all for me. Mark Lindley likes the effect of these meantone<br/>fifths<br/>&gt; in the lute music of Milan from around the 1530&apos;s, and finds this<br/>&gt; tuning more pleasing than 12-tET (which theorists report was<br/>becoming<br/>&gt; standard on the lute by around the middle of the century).</p><p>Isn&apos;t there a lute tutorial with a section on tuning that says simply<br/>&quot;tune the strings as tight as they can get without breaking&quot;?  Even if<br/>the technology had moved on from there, it&apos;s possible that the lutes<br/>wouldn&apos;t have kept perfect equal temperament for long, and so the<br/>effect of the fifths might have been more like those of a precisely<br/>tuned meantone harpsichord.</p><p>&gt; For neo-Gothic music, I find that the Pythagorean and 7-based<br/>&gt; intervals form a very nice and happy family, so that in effect a<br/>&gt; 24-note tuning for 2-3-7 JI gives me a regular Pythagorean scale<br/>plus<br/>&gt; the special &quot;7-flavor&quot; steps, plus the ideal optimization.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For Renaissance music, meantone gives regular 5-limit intervals of a<br/>&gt; conventional 16th-century style plus the 7-based intervals and other<br/>&gt; treats such as near-11:9 neutral thirds (regarded as consonances by<br/>&gt; Vicentino, who, however, found the near-7:6 and near-7:4 as leaning<br/>&gt; toward dissonance, along with the near-9:7).</p><p>Yes, it does seem that the 7- and 11-limit pull in the same direction.<br/> So the &quot;7&quot; and &quot;11&quot; flavour would become equivalent in 31-equal.  And<br/>the 3-flavour would be replaced by the 5-flavour.  So there&apos;s no way<br/>of getting away from the 5-limit intervals in meantone.  But there&apos;s<br/>still a contrast between &quot;neat&quot; and &quot;flavoured&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m interested in how neo-Gothic would work in meantone.  I<br/>haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; followed the details of the theory as you outlined it.  I tend to<br/>&gt; &gt; switch off when I see harmonic progressions discussed, because I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; not familiar with the traditional theory.  Perhaps a summary of<br/>&gt; &gt; characteristic progressions would be useful, or I could go back<br/>&gt; &gt; through the archives.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my longer post, I give a few examples, including some which can<br/>be<br/>&gt; played on a usual 12-note meantone keyboard with a range of Eb-G#.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me maybe reassure you on one point about neo-Gothic<br/>music:<br/>&gt; it doesn&apos;t really fit traditional theory as many people define it,<br/>&gt; based mostly on 18th-19th century European harmony. It&apos;s more like<br/>&gt; 13th-14th century European theory, something quite different, with a<br/>&gt; very different set of progressions.</p><p>There doesn&apos;t seem to be as strong a contrast as some people suggest.<br/> The progressions may be different, but they&apos;re still progressions.<br/>And there&apos;s still the idea of particular intervals resolving in<br/>particular directions.  Such ideas, from what I&apos;ve seen, are unique to<br/>the European tradition.  Not that I don&apos;t belong to that tradition,<br/>but I don&apos;t have much education in this area.  I am trying to learn,<br/>at my own speed.</p><p>&gt; Why don&apos;t I give URL&apos;s for my &quot;Gentle introduction to neo-Gothic<br/>&gt; progressions,&quot; and invite your questions or feedback. One thing I<br/>&gt; tried to do was to explain some of the style without assuming<br/>&gt; familiarity with medieval theory, but only readers can say how<br/>closely<br/>&gt; I approached this ideal:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_15038.html#15038">/tuning/topicId_15038.html#15038</a>  (1/Pt 1)<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_15630.html#15630">/tuning/topicId_15630.html#15630</a>  (1/Pt 2A)<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_15685.html#15685">/tuning/topicId_15685.html#15685</a>  (1/Pt 2B)<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_16134.html#16134">/tuning/topicId_16134.html#16134</a>  (1/Pt 2C)</p><p>Yes, they can always be listed again.  I did find them and go through<br/>them after sending that original message.</p><p>It seems the general case is for a 7th chord on the VIIth degree to<br/>resolve onto a 3-limit chord on the tonic.  And all parts move by<br/>either a tone or semitone.  It looks like each chord could be given a<br/>meantone tuning, and the flavoured versions tend to have those smaller<br/>semitones and larger tones.</p><p>I&apos;ve written the examples onto a few cards, and I&apos;ll try them with<br/>different tunings sometime.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If enough intervals with 7 and 11 are involved, it may be possible<br/>&gt; &gt; to remove the Pythagorean ones altogether.  So an 11-limit aware<br/>&gt; &gt; meantone notation could be used for variable pitched instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From a neo-Gothic perspective, I want very much to keep those<br/>&gt; Pythagorean intervals, which nicely contrast with the 7-based ones<br/>to<br/>&gt; make a happy family; but for 11-limit styles, meantone could be the<br/>&gt; ideal choice.</p><p>Yes, there&apos;s no way you can fake Pythagorean intervals in meantone<br/>because they don&apos;t exist.</p><p>&gt; For example, in neo-Gothic, a 24-note e-based tuning at ~704.61<br/>cents<br/>&gt; optimizes the ratios of 2-3-7, 11:7, and 11:8 _as they&apos;re typically<br/>&gt; used in this musical style_, but not necessarily as they&apos;d be used<br/>in<br/>&gt; 11-limit. The 11:8, for example, is a kind of special &quot;Wolf fourth&quot;<br/>&gt; occurring between a diminished fourth and major sixth of a sonority<br/>&gt; expanding to a trine like a usual major sixth sonority:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G#4 A4<br/>&gt; Eb4 E4<br/>&gt; B3  A3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In an 11-limit system of harmony, I suspect that these intervals<br/>might<br/>&gt; be used in quite different ways, and that the e-based temperament<br/>&gt; might be much less relevant than your neat 41-note well-temperament<br/>&gt; idea, which looks really worthwhile to me in theory and practice.</p><p>There isn&apos;t any other theory of 11-limit music I know of that says<br/>anything about how such intervals should behave.  So, if you&apos;re<br/>finding progressions that work in one context, they might be adaptable<br/>to another.  The B-Eb is a like B-D# and a 5:4 major third.  Then<br/>Eb-G# is an 11:8, and the B-G# is the major sixth.  Unfortunately, as<br/>that&apos;s a Pythagorean interval, we don&apos;t end up with a genuine 11-limit<br/>chord.  I see.</p><p>However, if we move the major sixth from the 3- to 5-flavour, the<br/>major third becomes neutral.  That could be:</p><p>D/ E<br/>A  B<br/>F/ E</p><p>This progression can be played on the white notes of my neutral third<br/>mapping.  It looks like it could be promising as a cadence.  The<br/>&quot;11-limit&quot; chord still can&apos;t be made just, but it does contain only<br/>approximations to 11-limit intervals.  And it also contains the two<br/>intervals considered dissonant in this context -- the 11:8 fifth and<br/>the 6:5 third (or 5:3 here).  So, it&apos;s worth a look.</p><p>         Graham</p></div><h3><a id=22095 href="#22095">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2001 1:13:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rummaging around the archives, I found this:</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

If we take the 9:8 more accurately<br/>&gt; at 203.91 cents, then we get six of these tones at 1223.46<br/>&gt; cents -- and the comma at 23.46 cents, as accurate an<br/>&gt; approximation as we&apos;re likely to need.</p><p>Hello Margo,</p><p>I suppose, since you seem to be quite familiar with Boethius,<br/>that you are probably aware that this demonstration of the<br/>&quot;Pythagorean Comma&quot; (in quotes because I believe its recognition<br/>is likely far older than Pythagoras&apos;s) dates from long before<br/>Jacobus, c. 1325.

Although the ratio of these two numbers is not<br/>given a name, neither here nor in _Sectio Canonis_, it<br/>is none other than the Pythagorean Comma.</p><p>(Boethius recapitulates this with less explanation<br/>in 4.2 [Bower, p. 121-122], at the end of his near-quoting<br/>from _Sectio Canonis_ Propositions 1 - 9.)</p><p>Taking advantage of modern mathematics this can be simplified.</p><p>Using 8 and 9 as factors gives a clear presentation:</p><p>8^0  8^1  8^2  8^3  8^4  8^5  8^6[* 9^0]<br/>                                         &gt; 8^5 * 9^0<br/>                              8^5 * 9^1<br/>                                         &gt; 8^4 * 9^1<br/>                              8^4 * 9^2<br/>                                         &gt; 8^3 * 9^2<br/>                              8^3 * 9^3<br/>                                         &gt; 8^2 * 9^3<br/>                              8^2 * 9^4<br/>                                         &gt; 8^1 * 9^4<br/>                              8^1 * 9^5<br/>                                         &gt; 8^0 * 9^5<br/>                             [8^0 *]9^6</p><p>It&apos;s easy to see here that if 8 and 9 are our factors,<br/>the exponents progress according to the vector addition<br/>formula |-1 1|, giving a series of 6 successive 9:8 ratios.</p><p>In prime-factor notation:</p><p>2^0  2^3  2^6  2^9  2^12  2^15  2^18[* 3^0]<br/>                                            &gt; 2^15 * 3^0<br/>                                2^15 * 3^2<br/>                                            &gt; 2^12 * 3^2<br/>                                2^12 * 3^4<br/>                                            &gt; 2^9  * 3^4<br/>                                2^9  * 3^6<br/>                                            &gt; 2^6  * 3^6<br/>                                2^6  * 3^8<br/>                                            &gt; 2^3  * 3^8<br/>                                2^3  * 3^10<br/>                                            &gt; 2^0  * 3^10<br/>                               [2^0  *]3^12</p><p>Here the vector addition formula is |-3 2|.<br/>(Can someone please explain how the actual addition works<br/>in this case?)</p><p>Now, for the benefit of further historical research...</p><p>In Base-60 numbering system:</p><p>1  8  1,4  8,32  1,8,16  9,6,8  1,12,49,4<br/>                                            &gt; 9,6,8<br/>                                1,21,55,12<br/>                                            &gt; 10,14,24<br/>                                1,32,9,36<br/>                                            &gt; 11,31,12<br/>                                1,43,40,48<br/>                                            &gt; 12,57,36<br/>                                1,56,38,24<br/>                                            &gt; 14,34,48<br/>                                2,11,13,12<br/>                                            &gt; 16,24,9<br/>                                2,27,37,21</p><p>(1,12,49,4) * 2  =  2,25,38,8</p><p>So in base-60 the Pythagorean comma would thus be:</p><p>    (2,27,37,21) / (2,25,38,8)</p><p>=   1,0,49,6,56,42,41,6,32,...</p><p>= ~ 1,0,49,7   ...a very good approximation</p><p>I presented the base-60 notation because I have a strong<br/>hunch that the &quot;Pythagorean comma&quot; was known to the Sumerians.</p><p>Are there any Assyriologists or Sumerologists out there<br/>who recognize this progression of numbers?
