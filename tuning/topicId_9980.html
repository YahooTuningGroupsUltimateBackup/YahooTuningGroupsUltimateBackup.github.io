First in Basic, by<br/>&gt;Eduardo Sabat and later in Ada, by me, in Scala (the command SHOW<br/>STRINGLEN).<br/>&gt;It calculates fret positions for one string at a time, taking the<br/>&gt;string stretching into consideration. But getting the parameters<br/>&gt;right is rather cumbersome. Also, string stiffness is not taken into<br/>&gt;account and I don&apos;t know if its influence can be neglected.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a><br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>According to my experience with the Dinarra, I can make the following<br/>comments.<br/>In order to deduct my equation I take into account the three physical<br/>states of the chord.<br/>The chords weight the same in each of the different states..<br/>State 0 : Is the chord &quot;as per&quot;, before stretching. It has, let&apos;s say, 3<br/>to 5<br/>milimeters less than in state 2.<br/>State 1 : Tuned chord in normal tuning. The first chord is tuned at 660<br/>Hz,<br/>the fifth at 110 and so on. The length of the chords are the standard<br/>for the instrument.<br/>I use a length of 650 mm for Dinarra.<br/>State 2 : Pushed string. The value of the total length is the addition<br/>of both<br/>cathetus of the &quot;triangle&quot;. The hypotenuse is in this case always 650.<br/>When I handle the physical formulas, the &quot;Modulus of Young&quot; (M of Y) is<br/>eliminated.<br/>I believe this procedure is legitimate. The final formula is formed ONLY<br/>by<br/>lengths. The streching of the chord from state zero to one is related<br/>with the M of  Y<br/>which is hidden. M of Y is the relation of length and weight. The<br/>streching of the<br/>chord from state zero to one is the realtion of length and &quot;note&quot;..<br/>This streching of the chords is a constant mathematical value of each<br/>chord.<br/>I call this &quot;Delta L sub zero-one&quot;. It has a value of 3 to 5 mm. wich is<br/>the same for<br/>plastic or steel chords, be them torched or not. This value is easily<br/>measured<br/>in steel chords. Both in the Dinarra and in the ordinary guitar the<br/>using of the chords<br/>increases this value till it stabilizes for a reasonable period of time.</p><p>The practical solution to have a trustworthy and accurate Dinarra is<br/>making the<br/>length of each chord variable. Bear in mind that the words trustworthy<br/>and<br/>accurate have in this case the same physical meaning than the one they<br/>have<br/>in the study of  scales.<br/>The bridge of electrical guitars generally have inside movable bridges<br/>for each<br/>of the chords. There is for acoustic Dinarra a special device wich makes<br/>it<br/>possible to vary the length of each of the chords easily. This device is<br/>very<br/>light and is of my invention.<br/>I have not yet analized mathematically this practical solution but for<br/>now it<br/>is the only one we have got and it works very well in practice.<br/>Working with harmonical echoe in the different chords I was able to<br/>value the<br/>accuracy and trustworth of this device I mentioned above, even thought<br/>I do not have a frequencymeter of direct reading. The result is<br/>efficient enough.</p><p>Eduardo<br/>--<br/>Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi<br/>Simon Bolivar 1260<br/>11300 Montevideo<br/>URUGUAY<br/>email: <a href="mailto:esabat@adinet.com.uy">esabat@adinet.com.uy</a></p><p>URL:    <a href="http://members.xoom.com/dinarra/dinarra.html">http://members.xoom.com/dinarra/dinarra.html</a></p></div>
