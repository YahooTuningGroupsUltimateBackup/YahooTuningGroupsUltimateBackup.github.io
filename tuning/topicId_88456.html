All of this happens with no noticeable lag and is as response (once set up right) as playing the GR-20 normally.</p><p>In this case the chosen tuning is 17 equal divisions of the octave and these are excerpts from an improvisation / exploration of 17 EDO.</p><p>Probably not of interest too much unless you&apos;ve not tried 17 edo</p><p>MP3 Dizzy Heights of Ego</p><p><a href="http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=174">http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=174</a></p><p>MP3 Plowing Dust</p><p><a href="http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=173">http://notonlymusic.com/board/download/file.php?id=173</a></p></div><h3><a id=88457 href="#88457">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2010 9:22:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;christopherv&quot; &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Using a program called &quot;Fractal Tune Smithy&quot; I can play my Roland GR-20 in different tuning once I set the GR-20 to &quot;local off&quot;.</p><p>I think it is only appropriate here to give a shout to Robert Walker, the man behind FTS. Robert is a long-time member of both this list and MMM, and has done boatloads of work to help the microtonal community create sounds and music with his software. Generous to a fault, and always obliging when you&apos;re stuck on something, I wish he was around more. A genuinely nice guy, and a real positive element of the off-shoots of the Mills tuning lists.</p><p>Even though I hammered him relentlessly over the years about trying to get some semblance of a modern and useable UI on the stuff, he never complained!</p><p>Robert, your efforts continue to bear musical fruit...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
