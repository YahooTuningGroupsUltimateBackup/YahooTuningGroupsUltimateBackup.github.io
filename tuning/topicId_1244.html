That seems contrary to all my experience (and the very definition<br/>of un-weighted)! Of course &quot;lightness&quot; is subjective, but it&apos;s<br/>definitely easier (for me) to play unweighted synth after playing piano<br/>for a while than to play piano after playing unweighted synth for a<br/>while.</p></div>
