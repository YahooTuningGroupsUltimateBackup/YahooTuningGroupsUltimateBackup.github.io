I would like to also track down<br/>&gt; this book as well.</p><p>Presume you&apos;re referring to Bonnie C Wade &quot;Music in India: the Classical Traditions&quot;...  Check out <a href="http://www.khazana.com">www.khazana.com</a>.  That&apos;s where I got my copy.  It&apos;s in print for $24.</p><p>&gt; both of these concerts they were using<br/>&gt; these little electronic Tamboura boxes to supply the drones</p><p>Yeah... &quot;electronic sruti boxes&quot;.  The Ali Akbar school sells &apos;em; and Khazana might also have them.  They&apos;re not too expensive.  They seem to be used almost exclusively in place of tambura by Carnatic musicians these days.  I prefer the live tambura myself, but they&apos;re widely popular.  (I guess I don&apos;t envy the tambura player&apos;s job over the course of a 3 hour concert... so I can see why people like these electronic gadgets for that reason alone...)</p><p>&gt; I was unable to inspect one up close, but I would like to ask if<br/>&gt; anyone on the list has ever got to see one of these to where you<br/>&gt; might be able to tell me if the intervals of the drones could be<br/>&gt; switched to other pitches?</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve looked at them but not up close.  They come in many varieties, with various continous knobs to set the drone frequencies and invervals within some range.  There also exist hand-pumped sruti boxes; check them out at the Ali Akbar school:</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://www.aacm.org/shop/index.html">http://www.aacm.org/shop/index.html</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
