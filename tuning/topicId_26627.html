The concerts on Thursday, October 18th (a full evening of Harry<br/>Partch), and Friday, October 26th will be held at the Washington Square<br/>United Methodist Church (133 West 4th Street). All concerts begin at 8 pm.<br/>Admission is $12, $6 seniors.</p><p>The Saturday, September 29th program features J.S. Bach&apos;s Brandenburg<br/>Concerto No. 4 highlighted by Andreas Werckmeister&apos;s &quot;famous&quot; chromatic<br/>tuning of 1681.  The performance features violinist Juliann Klopotic and<br/>recorder players Johnny Reinhard and Deborah Booth.  Quebec&apos;s Bozzini Quartet<br/>makes its New York debut playing Charles Ives&apos;s String Quartet No. 2 in<br/>Ives&apos;s preferred &quot;fine tuning&quot; of extended-Pythagorean intonation, as well as<br/>Johnny Reinhard&apos;s polymicrotonal string quartet, Cosmic Rays.  AFMM veteran<br/>Skip LaPlante resurrects his timeless classic Glyptodont, named for an<br/>extinct South American armadillo, performed by the Music For Homemade<br/>Instruments Ensemble.  And master Macedonian bottles artist Zoron Madzirov<br/>explores his tuning inheritance in the world premiere of Microdonia.</p><p>The Thursday, October 18th concert is devoted to the early music of American<br/>microtonal music pioneer Harry Partch (1900-1974), now at the Washington<br/>Square Church (133 W. 4th). The 17 Li Po Songs (1930-33) will be performed in<br/>their entirety by violist Anastasia Solberg and the evening&apos;s featured<br/>vocalist, Johnny Reinhard. The entertaining quartet versions of U.S. Highball<br/>(1944) - &quot;A Musical Account of Slim&apos;s Transcontinental Hobo Trip,&quot; and<br/>Barstow (1944) - &quot;Eight Hitchhikers&apos; Inscriptions from a Highway Railing at<br/>Barstow, California&quot; are heard with the next generation of<br/>Partch-instruments.  The Kithara, a 72-string harp built and played by Skip<br/>LaPlante, has been designed to be portable.  Keyboardist Joshua Pierce<br/>simulates a Chromelodeon, a 43-note per octave harmonium, courtesy of Henry<br/>Lowengard&apos;s sound design for the Proteus synthesizer.  Now, add virtuoso<br/>microtonal guitarist Jon Catler to the mix and you have sizzling microtonal<br/>music from the prime of the composer&apos;s hobo period.  Cellist Dave Eggar joins<br/>the Ensemble for a finale of Partch&apos;s Dark Brother.</p><p>The Friday, October 26th (at Washington Square Church) alternates earlier<br/>microtonal expressions with new.  Roman Giacinto Scelsi&apos;s trio Okanagon for<br/>harp (Nina Kellman), double bass (Mat Fieldes), and gong (Don Conreaux) is<br/>given a rare performance. Mexican microtonal pioneer Juli&agrave;n Carrillo&apos;s<br/>Crespuscular for cello (Dave Eggar) and piano (Joshua Pierce) will receive<br/>its American premiere.  17-year-old percussion prodigy Adel Sabirianov from<br/>Kazan, Tartarstan (in Russia) introduces spectacular original music for<br/>timpani.  Seasoned pros Mike Ellis, Joshua Pierce, and Johnny Reinhard<br/>(soprano sax, prepared piano, and bassoon, respectively) make music of the<br/>moment.  18-year-old Bostonion David Glasier premieres his latest work, a<br/>Suite for Harps in Quartertones.  And AFMM violin demon Tom Chiu sets the<br/>stage afire with his latest composition.</p><p>The AFMM gave its very first concert at Christ and St. Stephen&apos;s Church on<br/>March 7, 1981.  Since then, the AFMM has achieved much, including<br/>international success, most recently in Norway, England, and Russia.  To<br/>complement the achievement of a double-decade of concert presenting, a newly<br/>recorded commercially available recording of Charles Ives&apos;s Universe<br/>Symphony, as realized and conducted by Johnny Reinhard, will be available<br/>through Michael Thorne and the Stereo Society.  A complete score of this<br/>large work has been produced on Finale by the AFMM, and a book, Ives&apos;s<br/>Universe, further augments.</p></div><h3><a id=26631 href="#26631">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2001 10:53:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &lt;<a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Thursday, August 02, 2001 8:36 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] MicroFest 2001: 20 Years<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; AMERICAN FESTIVAL OF MICROTONAL MUSIC<br/>&gt; Celebrates its 20th Anniversary with 3 Autumn Concerts in New York<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MicroFest 2001: 20 Years</p><p>Now *that&apos;s* what I really miss, now that I&apos;m on the &quot;other side&quot;!</p><p>And Tom Chiu is composing his own stuff now?!

After the New<br/>York concerts in the Fall, some of the AFMMers play with Critical Band in<br/>Toronto, Winnipeg, and Vancouver.  In May, we have some big plans for<br/>Amsterdam (more information as it develops).  We are available in the U.S.,<br/>of course, but there is usually little support from California and other<br/>parts of the States to cover the requisite travel costs.  However, countries<br/>are interested in bringing us to them.  We present largely American music<br/>when we travel abroad.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
