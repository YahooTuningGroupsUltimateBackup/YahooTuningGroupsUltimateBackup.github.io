But I tend to think that intelligent people will at least<br/>try a new tool if it gives them some additional ability they currently<br/>lack.</p><p>&gt; And my own opinion is that if these are supposed to be taken as<br/>&gt; striking &quot;art&quot; on it&apos;s own, then there is something distressingly akin<br/>&gt; to &quot;colorization&quot; about the whole process... I mean these are not<br/>&gt; rearrangements (or even arrangements outside of whatever&apos;s been done<br/>&gt; before they got to JdL&apos;s program for that matter), they&apos;re just<br/>&gt; retunings - one size fits all... and it just seems (to me anyway) that<br/>&gt; it would be a much better (or prudent) idea to present the retunings<br/>&gt; of the existing material as experiments in seeing what seems to work<br/>&gt; and what could use some tweaking, rather than an impossible to say<br/>&gt; (and obviously disagreeable to many) assumption that these great<br/>&gt; composers might have liked this.</p><p>I am not saying that I know what the greats would have liked. If one does<br/>not like listening to DeLaubenfels retunings then one is not so compelled.<br/>Why all the uproar? I am completely mystified. A guy writes some tuning<br/>software, retunes some MIDI files, says it sounds great to him, and people<br/>jump all over him. Huh???</p><p>&gt;    From: &quot;Paul H. Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com">PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; The major omission here is of course meantone temperament.<br/>&gt; Western composers of the &quot;early&quot; (c.900-1680) and &quot;common practice&quot;<br/>&gt; (c.1680-1900) eras did not write music in just intonation, with the possible<br/>&gt; exception of a brief &quot;schismatic&quot; period in the 1400s. There were three<br/>&gt; major tuning paradigms for Western music: Pythagorean, meantone, and 12-tone<br/>&gt; circulating (ultimately ET), in that order. If one wishes to view this as an<br/>&gt; &quot;evolution&quot;, equal temperament should really be compared with meantone,<br/>&gt; which is what it &quot;evolved&quot; from (although 12-equal had been present on lutes<br/>&gt; since the Pythagorean era, so that&apos;s another somewhat relevant comparison).<br/>&gt; One should, of course, compare each _consonant interval_ in ET with the JI<br/>&gt; version of that interval, but to me what is usually done, comparing an<br/>&gt; entire _scale_ of 7 or 12 tones in ET with one in JI, is musically<br/>&gt; irrelevant and misleading.</p><p>Yes, Paul I actually know this, and I left meantone out in my haste to<br/>finish my post. Thanks for pointing out my omission, and for the<br/>additional detail.</p><p>&gt;    From: <a href="mailto:johnlink@con2.com">johnlink@con2.com</a> (John Link)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I have plans for extended solos in the middle of some Chopin<br/>&gt; nocturnes that I&apos;ve arranged for soprano and guitar or SATB and guitar. I<br/>&gt; believe that they&apos;ll be great Chopin. I bet that NO one will be expecting<br/>&gt; to hear what I plan to do, and I hope that they will be pleasantly<br/>&gt; surprised. Maybe some people will even say: &quot;That&apos;s the way Chopin ought to<br/>&gt; be played!&quot;. (That&apos;s what *I* think.)</p><p>Oh, you are in BIG trouble!! Cool daddy-o.</p><p>&gt;    From: Paul Hahn &lt;<a href="mailto:Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu">Paul-Hahn@library.wustl.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See also Keith Jarrett, who has done renditions of classical standards<br/>&gt; that incorporate jazz improvisations into otherwise &quot;straight&quot;<br/>&gt; performances.</p><p>Oh yeah. We have heard it. Thanks Paul.</p><p>&gt;    From: <a href="mailto:johnlink@con2.com">johnlink@con2.com</a> (John Link)</p><p>&gt; &gt;        What an unexpectedly (to me) contentious issue this thread of<br/>&gt; &gt;faithfulness to the composer&apos;s wishes is! Now that I&apos;ve said more than my<br/>&gt; &gt;share I will shut up after this: If we all had computers with software<br/>&gt; &gt;that would allow us to compose and record, even perform whatever was in<br/>&gt; &gt;our heads...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What? Do you really think that a computer-generated sequence of sounds is<br/>&gt; in the same category as live performance by human beings? I&apos;ve heard<br/>&gt; musicians complain about the work they lose because of DJ&apos;s playing<br/>&gt; recorded music, but do we now have *composers* who want to remove the human<br/>&gt; element entirely from performance?</p><p>Oh no, no, no. I am just saying that the capability now exists to build<br/>any sound or sequence of sounds whatsoever (with csound for instance), and<br/>that if a composer wished, given enough time and skill, she could make a<br/>recording of anything she could imagine. I view live performance as a<br/>necessity.</p><p>John Starrett, not shutting up like he promised.</p></div><h3><a id=6840 href="#6840">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/1999 9:40:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[John Starrett:]<br/>&gt; I am not saying that I know what the greats would have liked.</p><p>No, me neither.</p><p>&gt;If one does not like listening to DeLaubenfels retunings then one is<br/>not so compelled.</p><p>Absolutely, I agree... and trust me, I&apos;m not exactly foaming at the<br/>mouth to get in there with my bulk eraser (ah, I mean delete button I<br/>guess, well you know what I mean!) or anything either. And I think<br/>that the more sophisticated (or perhaps something like contextually<br/>sensitive) the program becomes, the better and better it&apos;s all going<br/>to be... JdL has said several times himself that these are preliminary<br/>steps, and I believe that this (at it&apos;s core) is good and heartfelt<br/>work that many people (who&apos;s tuning interest line up or overlap with<br/>it) could really benefit from.</p><p>&gt;Why all the uproar? I am completely mystified. A guy writes some<br/>tuning software, retunes some MIDI files, says it sounds great to him,<br/>and people jump all over him. Huh???</p><p>Well I think that the &quot;veiled&quot; -- and I have not even the slightest<br/>doubt *UNINTENDED* -- message of &quot;it sounds great to him&quot; has been<br/>that it (&quot;it&quot; being someone else&apos;s music) didn&apos;t sound good enough to<br/>begin with... and whether this is fair to JdL or not, it apparently<br/>has struck a raw nerve in many... and I guess I&apos;d have to say I&apos;m one<br/>of those that can understand this. (But I think I&apos;ve also made it<br/>pretty clear why I believe using these familiar pieces is a good idea<br/>in an educational and experimental sense.)</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=6855 href="#6855">ðŸ”—</a>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>12/11/1999 7:27:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: John Starrett &lt;<a href="mailto:jstarret@math.cudenver.edu">jstarret@math.cudenver.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    From: <a href="mailto:johnlink@con2.com">johnlink@con2.com</a> (John Link)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Well, I have plans for extended solos in the middle of some Chopin<br/>&gt;&gt; nocturnes that I&apos;ve arranged for soprano and guitar or SATB and guitar.
