Unless...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;You are probably aware that since Karlheinz taught Markus<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;pedal notes on the trumpet are suddenly possible; you can<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;bend these everywhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The other, &quot;traditional&quot; way to bend a note every which way<br/>&gt; is halve valving (Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White, Perez<br/>&gt; Prado). It works over the complete range. There is no pitch<br/>&gt; focus any more, you&apos;re floating in the continuum with your<br/>&gt; ears the only guides.

It<br/>&gt; certainly frees you from thinking about the instrument too much.<br/>&gt;</p><p>###It seems most instrumentalists, particularly younger ones, have<br/>had experience with quartertones, since almost every living composer<br/>has used at least one of them in a piece... :)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;For practical reasons it is probably good to stick to the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;true harmonic notes in the upper range (your trumpet player<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;will tell you where this begins; I expect it to be somewhat<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;lower than what is normally (without bending) considered<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;high range&quot;).

I&apos;m about to write a piece for<br/>&gt; trumpet and piano (probably, in *my* book, one of the *least*<br/>&gt; inherent microtonal combinations possible...:)</p><p>Hi, Joseph,</p><p>I play the trumpet (at an amateur level), and I would agree that it<br/>is not one of the better candidates for obtaining microtones with a<br/>conventional instrument.</p><p>&gt; How far can a trumpet player bend up and down with the lips in<br/>&gt; various registers?</p><p>As others have already pointed out, much more easily down than up.  I<br/>recently attempted to play something on the trumpet along with a 5/17-<br/>comma meantone midi accompaniment track that I had prepared (keeping<br/>A=440), and I found that I could produce the C&apos;s and F&apos;s most easily<br/>if pushed the tuning slide all the way in (to raise the pitch<br/>slightly) and then lowered the other pitches by either lipping and/or<br/>using the pinkie tuning slide (possible only when the third valve is<br/>depressed).  Thus, (concert) Bb would be played (on a Bb trumpet)<br/>with no valves depressed, whereas A# would be played with the 1st and<br/>3rd valves depressed and the pinkie tuning slide extended.</p><p>As an amateur, my limit for lipping a pitch downward is around 25 or<br/>30 cents, but of course a virtuoso could do better.  But I agree with<br/>another response that you should not expect a player to execute<br/>accurate changes in pitch-bending in passages with rapid movement of<br/>notes.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; I realize that the brass instruments are based upon the harmonic<br/>&gt; series, and I&apos;ve written for horn in just intonation where the horn<br/>&gt; player plays the &quot;natural&quot; pitches (not always the ones generally<br/>&gt; used) go get at the harmonic series for each position.  Does the<br/>&gt; trumpet work similarly, or don&apos;t they like to play that way?? (I<br/>&gt; happened to have a *very* adventurous horn player who was &quot;into&quot;<br/>just<br/>&gt; intonation before *I* was...)</p><p>The horn is much better suited to microtonal experimentation, since<br/>the 7th, 11th, and 13th harmonics are all within the normal range of<br/>the instrument (whereas with the trumpet they&apos;re an octave higher<br/>than that, relatively speaking).  These harmonics are normally<br/>avoided, because they&apos;re out of tune with a twelve-tone octave, but<br/>for microtonality they&apos;re very handy.</p><p>In addition, the horn also offers the possibility of pulling the<br/>valve slides out farther (a lot of adjustment is possible) or even<br/>(in a double horn) swapping them between the F and Bb sides of the<br/>horn. For example, putting the Bb 3rd valve slide into the F side<br/>will give you something close to quartertones when the 3rd valve is<br/>depressed, either alone or in combination with other valves.</p><p>&gt; Any insights or practical observations would be appreciated.  I<br/>&gt; really don&apos;t want to write *yet another* standard 12-tET piece for<br/>&gt; this combo, if possible...</p><p>Now if your trumpet player had access to a slide trumpet, then you<br/>could have any pitch within the range of the instrument.  Problem<br/>with this, however, is that the player must learn a new technique,<br/>and the agility offered by valves is lost.  What I would like to see<br/>is a valve trumpet with a thumb-operated slide added that would<br/>adjust the pitch no matter which valves were depressed.  In order to<br/>have a total range of adjustment of ~130 cents (for +-65 cents of<br/>pitch alteration), if the thumb were to travel ~150 mm total (or +-75<br/>mm from its rest position), it would&apos;t work to have the thumb operate<br/>the slide directly.  Instead, there would have to be some sort of<br/>linkage that provided a mechanical advantage of speed (or travel) of<br/>~2.5 times.</p><p>Short of making permanent modifications to an existing instrument,<br/>there is one other possibility for producing greatly altered<br/>intervals on a trumpet.  If it were possible to have an alternate<br/>(longer) 3rd-valve slide manufactured to produce a pitch 50 cents<br/>lower than usual when the 3rd valve was depressed, then you could<br/>have 12-ET with the 3rd valve up and quartertones with the 3rd valve<br/>depressed (besides being the most adjustable in pitch, since this<br/>piece of tubing *is* the pinky tuning slide).  Only a few 12-ET notes<br/>would be missing, most of them in the lower part of the range, and<br/>the instrument could be converted back to its original state in a<br/>matter of seconds by swapping the original valve slide back in.  This<br/>would certainly be much less expensive than a custom-built<br/>instrument, and the playing technique would be much, much easier (and<br/>with much more agility) than with lipping the pitch on a conventional<br/>instrument.  Perhaps a brass manufacturer could be persuaded to offer<br/>this as an accessory item for *all* of the valved brass instruments.<br/>(Anyway, just a thought.)</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2004 1:15:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.
