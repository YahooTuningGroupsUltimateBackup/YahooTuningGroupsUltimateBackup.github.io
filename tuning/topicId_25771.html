Perhaps you will find it<br/>interesting.</p><p>A major metropolitan symphony is considering the endowment of a Director<br/>of Music Science. The responsibilities of this position would be<br/>extremely broad, covering the following three general areas:</p><p>- In partnership with very prominent local universities, the Director of<br/>Music Science would establish a series of technical lectures targeted at<br/>the undergraduate student body but open to the general public. Such<br/>lectures would be prepared and delivered by university professors in<br/>support of their regular course syllabi, would take place in the<br/>symphony hall, and would enjoy the full cooperation and support of the<br/>symphony&apos;s director and musical staff.</p><p>- In partnership with local universities and other research and<br/>educational institutions, the Director of Music Science would establish<br/>a series of lectures targeted at the educated lay public. Such lectures<br/>would be prepared and delivered by nationally and internationally<br/>prominent figures in the fields of Anthropology, Architecture, Cognitive<br/>Science, Computer Science, History, Mathematics, Medicine, Philosophy,<br/>Physics, Psychology, Language, and the Arts. Although the audience can<br/>be presumed to share an aesthetic appreciation of the musical arts, the<br/>focus of these lectures would be on those aspects of music--particularly<br/>classical music--subject to rational investigation. Lectures would take<br/>place in the symphony hall, and would enjoy the full cooperation and<br/>support of the symphony&apos;s director and musical staff.</p><p>- In partnership with local universities and other research and<br/>educational institutions, the Director of Music Science will leverage<br/>the symphony&apos;s considerable contact list to facilitate a number of<br/>formal, interdisciplinary research projects aimed at the exploration of<br/>various aspects of music. Such projects shall involve, in a meaningful<br/>way, students of local secondary schools. Additionally, such projects<br/>shall have as their goal the successful publication of their results in<br/>peer-reviewed journals appropriate to each topic of study. Finally, such<br/>projects would enjoy the full cooperation and support of the symphony&apos;s<br/>director and musical staff.</p><p>This proposal is currently in a developmental stage. The sponsors of the<br/>proposal would greatly appreciate the feedback and support of the<br/>scientific community. Of particular importance would be the following:</p><p>- Arguments in favor of the concept, suitable for presentation to the<br/>symphony&apos;s board of directors.</p><p>- Suggestions for additions or amendments to the program.</p><p>- Offers to perform the public lectures described above. Please include<br/>a C.V. and a brief abstract of the proposed lecture material.</p><p>- Proposed topics for research, as well as offers to participate in such<br/>research. Again, please include a C.V. and a brief summary of the<br/>proposal, as well as an estimate of associated material requirements and<br/>costs.</p><p>Please address feedback to Jason Williscroft at <a href="mailto:jscroft@fairygod.com">jscroft@fairygod.com</a>.<br/>Thank you for your interest and support.</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/>http:\<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
