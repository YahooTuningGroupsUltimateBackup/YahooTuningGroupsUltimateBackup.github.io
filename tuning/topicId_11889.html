This is what I thought you<br/>meant when you wrote &quot;true&quot; interval - I was just seeking<br/>clarification.</p><p>I was reading from: &quot;The harmonic entropy is based on the concept<br/>that the critical band represents a certain degree of uncertainty in<br/>the perception of pitch, and for any &quot;true&quot; interval, the auditory<br/>system will perceive a range of intervals spanning a number of simple-<br/>integer ratios.&quot;</p><p>So the ear could percieve a 5/4 as a 9/7 or 16/13 etc...?</p><p>Also: &quot;Combination tones complicate the matter but with a knowledge<br/>of the amplitudes and frequencies of all combination tone components,<br/>Plomp&apos;s algorithm can be still applied. &quot;</p><p>Do the harmonic entropy computations include first, second ,third<br/>(etc..) order combination and difference tones supplied by<br/>neurological processing of intervals, or is anything beyond the first<br/>order negligible?</p><p>What are some compositional uses of this theory?</p><p>Thanks kindly,</p><p>Jacky</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;PERLICH@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacky Ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ekstasis@y...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve been reading your &quot;On Harmonic Entropy&quot;, and would like to<br/>ask<br/>&gt; &gt; for clarification on what you mean by &quot;True Intervals&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I just mean the actual interval being played, with a<br/>precise<br/>&gt; cents value, rather than the various just ratios that the brain<br/>tries<br/>&gt; to hear it as.

I think this has the potential<br/>to answer a question that I have long pondered about how our hearing<br/>tends to round off intervals.</p><p>You know, when I&apos;m mapping intervals to my synths and samplers, and I<br/>wish to bring them all in to the same tuning system, I have to make a<br/>compromise in that some of my modules are limited to a +50, -50 cents<br/>adjustment. This forces me to map and classify intervals to a certain<br/>pitch name if they fall within 1/4 tone above or below the 12 tET<br/>pitch name. This is really a horrible compromise too, because as we<br/>all know, that even though you may map a ratio to a certain key and<br/>call it a certain pitch name, what the ear percieves this as is<br/>entirely another thing altogether.</p><p>For example, in a 12 pitch tuning in a &quot;C to C&quot; octave, if I map a<br/>12/11 to &quot;D&quot; (which I must do if I want to tune it to 151 cents), and<br/>I&apos;m wanting to classify this in a scale as a &quot;whole tone&quot; - well, my<br/>ear tells me something entirely different - I&apos;m still hearing this as<br/>a minor second (obviously pitch naming/mapping/classification and the<br/>experience of &quot;major and minor&quot; scale degrees are two mutually<br/>exclusive things). Another example is: if I map a 13/10 to &quot;F&quot;, which<br/>I must do if I want to tune it to 454 cents - well I certainly don&apos;t<br/>hear this interval as a 4/3 - I hear it as a very wide major 3rd. So<br/>you see the paradoxical problem with this.</p><p>This leads to the following question: How far beyond the simple<br/>integer ratios does this band of classification extend in light of<br/>the reality of what the ear/neurological processing perceives? From<br/>what I&apos;ve been able to deduce from the Harmonic Entropy threads, the<br/>width of this is different for each interval, with the gravitational<br/>pull of the 3/2 being the most strong. So am I correct to assume that<br/>there is a sort of gradient scale of tonal gravity for each interval<br/>in terms of where it falls in integer size? If true, then the<br/>harmonic series would provide the order of gravitational pull: 1/1,<br/>2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 5/1 etc...right - wrong?</p><p>It is an honor to learn from you guys - thanks!!!</p><p>Jacky</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacky Ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ekstasis@y...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So the ear could percieve a 5/4 as a 9/7 or 16/13 etc...?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Jacky,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just thought I&apos;d take a stab at clarifying this.
