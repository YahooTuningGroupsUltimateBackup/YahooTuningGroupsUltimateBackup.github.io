I lean<br/>towards<br/>&gt;1/4 myself--again, me being a 31-toner, that&apos;s probably not surprising.</p><p>Well, I advocated a something closer to 2/7-comma meantone by optimizing<br/>its triads. If one is talking about chords with four or more notes<br/>forming consecutive fifths, then I would weight the tuning of the fifth<br/>more heavily, since there would be more of them than thirds. So maybe<br/>1/6-comma meantone for these chords.</p></div>
