If you don&apos;t already know about the event, you can<br/>read about it at <a href="http://www.untwelve.org/2010_competition.html">http://www.untwelve.org/2010_competition.html</a><br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.untwelve.org/2010_competition.html%20">http://www.untwelve.org/2010_competition.html%20</a>&gt;We currently offer a<br/>first place cash prize of $400 dollars, because that&apos;s<br/>what we are prepared to pay comfortably out of our current coffers. However,<br/>we would like to raise donor money so that we can use our current money to<br/>keep the organization funding future events. Our ability to meet our<br/>operating expenses is at a critical stage, and in these tough economic<br/>times, we are feeling the pinch!</p><p>We&apos;re writing to you to ask if you or anyone you know would be interested in<br/>donating to the cause. You&apos;d be enriching the life of a growing cultural<br/>institution unique in the Midwest, and helping in the creation of wonderful<br/>new music from fine composers, both young/upcoming and established.</p><p>One idea would be just to achieve through donations the $400 underwriting of<br/>prize money, break even on helping our composers, and stop there. But<br/>wouldn&apos;t it be great to have an all-out campaign similar to public radio,<br/>and have a goal to raise more through our network of friends, colleagues,<br/>and family--enough to offer smaller 2nd and 3rd place prizes and/or increase<br/>the pot for the 1st prize, all the while generating momentum and excitement<br/>for the event and for the organization?</p><p>&quot;What&apos;s in it for me?&quot;, you say/think....</p><p>Well, the benefits to a donor would be:</p><p>   -  A pride and a sense of contibution to the arts<br/>   -  A mention of their generosity in an email list blast, in fact, any<br/>   email blast between now and the end of the competition where the competition<br/>   is mention.<br/>   -  Links from the UnTwelve website that mention them and/or their<br/>   organization; in other words, *we will advertise your cause or<br/>   organization *from our website page about the competition.<br/>   -  Thank you gifts</p><p>We can do this with a few large or medium size donations from a few donors,<br/>or we can accomplish this by many of you who want to help giving a small<br/>amount : $5, $10, $20, $500, or whatever you might afford!!! Any donation<br/>whatsoever will get you mentioned as a donor on the UnTwelve website and<br/>emails. Every donation of $20-$100 will be met with a thank-you gift<br/>of the 2009<br/>UnTwelve compilation CD &lt;<a href="http://www.untwelve.org/2009compilation.html">http://www.untwelve.org/2009compilation.html</a>&gt;. Any<br/>gift of $100 will get you a gift of free attendance for you and a friend at<br/>the next 3 UnTwelve events. Any gift of $250 or more will be met with a<br/>private performance at your home (provided you live in Illinois or the<br/>midwest!!) of an extended piano solo work-in-progress, or a private<br/>screening of not-yet-publicly released &quot;60x60 UnTwelve mix&quot; video,<br/>consisting of video interpretations of 1-minute pieces by 60 composers, set<br/>to video art by Patrick Liddell &lt;<a href="http://www.ontologist.us">http://www.ontologist.us</a>&gt; (and made in<br/>collaboration with NYC&apos;s Vox Novus &lt;<a href="http://www.voxnovus.com">http://www.voxnovus.com</a>&gt;). Out-of-state<br/>donors will be mentioned on the UnTwelve website, at every live event and/or<br/>printed concert programs, and can have ads for their organization embedded<br/>into the competition webpage. The *top donor* will have the *first prize* in<br/>the competition *named after them or** their organization!<br/>*<br/>So, perhaps you or someone or some organization you know would like to<br/>support our cause of helping a composer receive a justly deserved award for<br/>their hard work in creating a worthy new piece of music. If so, you can go<br/>now to <a href="http://www.untwelve.org/donate.html">http://www.untwelve.org/donate.html</a> and make your donation.</p><p>Thanks for all you do!</p><p>The UnTwelve crew<br/><a href="http://www.untwelve.org">http://www.untwelve.org</a></p><br/>
