I spoke<br/>with Eduardo about the tuning many times and though language was not easy, we<br/>did cover some ground.  I understood, reluctantly, that a conventional guitar<br/>would match exactly frets on the Dinarra.  I wondered about this and asked<br/>Eduardo, &quot;So, it is like the French system, with 9 commas to the<br/>equal-tempered whole tone.&quot;  And he nodded yes.</p><p>Now, since no guitarist had to &quot;fudge&quot; anything to accompany the Dinarra on<br/>their conventional guitars, and I think it unlikely that he pulled any frets<br/>that he didn&apos;t have to when laying down all the others (which nearly engulf<br/>the instrument),  I think it is as I remember.  The theory of 53 is a basis<br/>for what appears to be 54.</p><p>Take into account the style of playing, moving only a single fret below, or<br/>above,or at most 2 frets, so as to deepen the melody.

If you mean within 5 cents, for diatonic music, sure -- see<br/>below.</p><p>&gt; Now, since no guitarist had to &quot;fudge&quot; anything to accompany the<br/>Dinarra on<br/>&gt; their conventional guitars, and I think it unlikely that he pulled<br/>any frets<br/>&gt; that he didn&apos;t have to when laying down all the others (which<br/>nearly engulf<br/>&gt; the instrument),  I think it is as I remember.</p><p>Johnny, I will wager any amount that not all of the 12-tET frets were<br/>left in place when refretting the instrument -- and if some were left<br/>in, the bridge was moved so that the former 12th fret no longer<br/>corresponds to the octave. Shall we ask Eduardo? Surely we wouldn&apos;t<br/>see Eduardo providing these very detailed lists of cents values,<br/>which agree with everything he&apos;s posted and written, if he were<br/>simply abandoning them in practice?</p><p>In the performance, there would usually only be a few cents<br/>difference between the notes on 12-tET guitar and the nearest notes<br/>on the Dinarra. Let&apos;s look at a typical diatonic key for the guitar,<br/>G major, with A taken as tuned identically on both guitars:</p><p>    12-tET guitar       Dinarra        Difference<br/>    -------------       -------        ----------<br/>G     1000              996.52           3.48&cent;<br/>A        0                 0               0&cent;<br/>B      200              203.46           3.48&cent;<br/>C      300              294.79           5.21&cent;<br/>D      500              498.26           1.74&cent;<br/>E      700              701.74           1.74&cent;<br/>F#     900              905.21           5.21&cent;</p><p>Much larger differences are quite common, for example in Renaissance<br/>music where a 12-tET lute plays with a meantone harpsichord. So<br/>no &quot;fudging&quot; would be necessary. To the contrary, intentional one-<br/>fret (and perhaps two-fret) variations in the playing of a particular<br/>note on the Dinarra, with neither version exactly agreeing with the<br/>12-tET chord tone below, can be clearly heard on the Dinarra tape.<br/>For chromatic notes not in the diatonic key of the tune, you can<br/>clearly hear that the Dinarra _never_ matches 12-tET.</p><p>&gt; The theory of 53 is a basis<br/>&gt; for what appears to be 54.</p><p>If 54 is lined up with 12, half the notes of 12 have no corresponding<br/>note in 54. This will translate to three or four notes in _any_<br/>diatonic key. The notes not falling within the common whole-tone<br/>scale will differ by the maximum possible amount (11.11&cent;).</p><p>&gt; Take into account the style of playing, moving only a single fret<br/>below, or<br/>&gt; above,or at most 2 frets, so as to deepen the melody.</p><p>Just as I supposed I heard above.</p><p>&gt; Regardless of the<br/>&gt; Dinarra&apos;s true condition, the jury is still out on this one.</p><p>I warmly welcome you to consider my arguments above, and let me know<br/>whether you still think the &quot;reality&quot; tuning of the Dinarra was 54,<br/>or in some other way departed from the &quot;theory&quot; tuning Eduardo has<br/>presented.</p></div>
