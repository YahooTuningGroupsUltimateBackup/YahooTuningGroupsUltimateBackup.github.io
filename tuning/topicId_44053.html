This is one<br/>designed for retuning midi files, and I wanted the following attributes:</p><p>(1) Near the key center, it functions as an honest meantone, with<br/>major thirds not too far off pure</p><p>(2) All fifths must be usable; no wolf fifths are allowed</p><p>(3) All thirds in all keys must be functional</p><p>I finally found such a temperament, named below &quot;grail.scl&quot;. The key<br/>idea was to have two pure 14/11 major thirds and one pure 9/7 major<br/>third in the remote keys. By giving them a precise just value, even if<br/>that value is not 5/4, I got something which didn&apos;t sound bad. For the<br/>minor thirds, I was happy to get two fine 7/6 subminors and settled<br/>for a couple of 13/11 intermediate minor thirds.</p><p>Here are the fifths, major thirds, and minor thirds above each scale<br/>degree:</p><p>0 695.623009 391.246018 304.376991<br/>1 708.753982 417.507964 304.376991<br/>2 700.000000 382.457951 308.753982<br/>3 708.788065 391.246018 273.703969<br/>4 695.623008 404.376991 304.376991<br/>5 695.623009 391.246018 291.246018<br/>6 708.788067 435.084096 317.542049<br/>7 700.000000 391.246017 317.542047<br/>8 708.753982 404.376991 291.246017<br/>9 695.623009 391.246018 304.376991<br/>10 691.211935 382.457953 273.703971<br/>11 691.211934 417.507965 308.753983</p><p>The major thirds on degree 1 and 11 are exact 14/11&apos;s, and on degree 6<br/>we have the 9/7. On degree 3 and 10 we get minor thirds of 273.7<br/>cents, which are good subminor thirds (to my mind, this is very<br/>acceptable.) On degrees 5 and 8 we have 291 cent minor thirds, which<br/>is pretty close to a 13/11 at 289 cents. All the other minor thirds<br/>improve on those of 12-equal. We have three sharp fifths a tad flatter<br/>than the 22-et fifth, which is quite acceptable, two of 12-et&apos;s<br/>excellent fifths, three 5/17-comma meantone fifths and two 1/2-comma<br/>meantone fifths; the last (over degrees 10 and 11) are the only fifths<br/>which are any kind of problem, being &quot;flattone&quot; fifths a cent flatter<br/>than the 26-equal fifth.</p><p>Here are some retuning examples. I also retuned a movement from the<br/>Emperor concerto, sequenced by some guy named G. Breed, but as<br/>sometimes happens Scala munged it, despite not giving the error<br/>message about not enough midi channels. I also retuned Mendelssohn&apos;s<br/>Italian, which worked except for adding a lot of weird percussion.<br/>Even if you disable channel 10, this still happens with complex<br/>retunings at the limit of what Scala capable of.</p><p><a href="/tuning/files/grail/steppes.mid">/tuning/files/grail/steppes.mid</a></p><p><a href="/tuning/files/grail/mv1.mid">/tuning/files/grail/mv1.mid</a></p><p><a href="/tuning/files/grail/mv3.mid">/tuning/files/grail/mv3.mid</a></p><p><a href="/tuning/files/grail/op6n9m4.mid">/tuning/files/grail/op6n9m4.mid</a></p><p>Here is the Scala scl file:</p><p>! grail.scl</p><p>Holy Grail circulating temperament with two 14/11 and one 9/7 major third</p><p>12</p><p>!</p><p>86.869027</p><p>195.623009</p><p>304.376991</p><p>391.246018</p><p>504.376991</p><p>578.080960</p><p>695.623009</p><p>795.623009</p><p>895.623009</p><p>1013.165056</p><p>1086.869026</p><p>1200.000000</p></div><h3><a id=44062 href="#44062">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/2/2003 8:22:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here is the Scala scl file:</p><p>I also have a version where I simply took my 36 target intervals and<br/>did an rms optimization.

Most synthesizers and samplers also have an absolute pitch resolution in Hertz that limits the bass frequency resolution.

Most synthesizers that &quot;appear&quot; to have 1 cent resolution actually have an internal resolution, often 768 steps per octave, that the user programmable tuning table is mapped to.

I<br/>personally was able to use his data, directly entering it into software I<br/>wrote myself to do synthesis.  My software won&apos;t be as accurate as his<br/>number, but I also didn&apos;t bother to edit out any of the extra precision.</p><p>The numbers he gave may have excess precision for some purposes, but I agree<br/>it doesn&apos;t hurt anything.  In fact the values he calculated ARE proably that<br/>exact.  The community will have to fight with the issue of lacking a way to<br/>reproduce scales accurately.  Reducing the presented accuracy certainly<br/>won&apos;t help anything.  Giving numbers only as much precision as typical<br/>synthesisizers can render would render the scale information useless,<br/>instead of being of limited use, which is better than no use at all.</p><p>Numbers in decimal cents can be recognized by software as representing exact<br/>integral ratios using fairly simple algorithms.  The more digits presented,<br/>the less ambiguity there is in the intended integer ratio (when applicable).</p><p>So it seems to me Gene&apos;s data is useful to some, less useful to others.<br/>Perhaps it is of limited use to the majority of people, but that is a<br/>problem that needs to be worked on.  Keep in mind that whenever anyone<br/>presents scales using exact integer ratios or equal-temperament steps rather<br/>than cents, they are actually giving INFINITE accuracy, which is much more<br/>than 6 digits after the decimal point.  In other words, the integer 1 is a<br/>shorthand for 1.0000000000000000000000000000... (etc.), and we don&apos;t want to<br/>stop using integers because of their extraneous precision.</p><p>This is just DATA being presented, and it is being presented in the<br/>&quot;universal language&quot; of numbers, and can be interpreted across many cultures<br/>and used on many kinds of instruments by a large variety of possible<br/>mechanisms.  People can find ways to tune any instrument using these<br/>numbers, and can throw away any extra precision that they can&apos;t use.  Any<br/>new software written now can be written to interpret the .scl file format,<br/>and the contents can be read by hand and used to manually calculate pitches<br/>in Hz for any instrument.  So the data as presented seems to me very<br/>appropriate for a public forum.</p><p>Independent of this, people need to be educated regarding this current<br/>difficulting in rendering pitches accurately, so that they can be aware when<br/>they might not really be hearing the intended scale.

And an organ tuner who is here with me today says that<br/>practical tunings may often be off by a few cents and still be considered<br/>&quot;in tune&quot;, that you would drive yourself crazy as a tuner truing to do<br/>better.  This sheds a slightly different light on the limitations of<br/>electronic instruments, making even crude synthesizer technology look pretty<br/>good!</p><p>This would also seem to make some distinctions based on exact ratios<br/>apprently irrelevant for organ tunings.  I have tenatively decided not to be<br/>concerned with any fine distinctions in exact ratios, and go more by things<br/>like RMS info instead, to help me make choices.  The choices will ultimately<br/>be determined by listening anyway, and listening on a synthesised instrument<br/>for simulation purposes is unlikely to reveal the actual _qualities_ that<br/>the tuning will have on the real instrument, because of fine distinctions in<br/>harmonic structure that will also vary note to note.</p><p>So I am feeling somewhat set back in my hopes to be able to wisely chose a<br/>scale in advance of actually trying it in the real instrument in question<br/>(organ in my case).
