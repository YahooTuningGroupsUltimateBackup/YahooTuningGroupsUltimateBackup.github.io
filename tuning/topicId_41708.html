It&apos;s easy<br/>to point out that 14th-century European intonation was generally<br/>derived, at least in conventional theory, from factors of 2 and 3<br/>only, while we now commonly use factors of 2-3-7-11-13-17-23. However,<br/>tunings are used in practice to realize musical patterns, as well as<br/>to produce new interactions, and many of the patterns I find myself<br/>playing or writing today are those which Machaut helped to make<br/>&quot;standard&quot; or &quot;routine.&quot;</p><p>While melodic beauty and rhythmic subtlety are basics of his art, I<br/>would emphasize especially his use of complex textures for three and<br/>four voices, and the element of directed harmonic progressions and<br/>their artful anticipation (sometimes delayed or diverted), as<br/>documented by a scholar such as Sarah Fuller.</p><p>Of course, even during Machaut&apos;s youth, Marchettus of Padua in his<br/>Lucidarium (1318) describes a &quot;fivefold division of the tone&quot; for<br/>polyphonic music which has served as an inspiration for modern<br/>intonational practices, along with Near Eastern sources of around the<br/>same era or earlier which explicitly describe ratios of 2-3-7-11-13.</p><p>Today we have such refinements as 17-note circles and minutely<br/>calculated temperaments -- following the general approach of<br/>Marchettus, for example, we might propose an approximate 21-fold<br/>division of the tone into a usual limma of 8 parts and apotome of 13<br/>parts; and a cadential diesis of 6 parts and chromatic semitone of 15<br/>parts. However, now as then, it is a matter of taste rather than of<br/>unalterable mathematical edict.</p><p>There is also the question of historical &quot;authenticity&quot;: the<br/>distinction between a performance on historical lines in Pythagorean<br/>tuning, or a combination of the Pythagorean and Archytan systems where<br/>some cadential imperfect concords have precise or approximate septimal<br/>ratios, and renditions in modern temperaments where fifths are<br/>somewhat stretched and fourths somewhat compressed from their just<br/>proportions. Given the conclusion of a scholar and interpreter such as<br/>Christoper Page that the purity of the stable concords was likely a<br/>prime concern of 14th-century European musicians, temperament might be<br/>considered the mark of a &quot;modernistic&quot; interpretation. At the same<br/>time, Page recommends the stretching of major imperfect concords at<br/>points such as cadences, citing Marchettus, and a system of just<br/>intonation on keyboard with two Pythagorean chains at a Pythagorean<br/>comma or 63:64 apart could nicely maintain the purity of 2:3:4 while<br/>permitting cadential major thirds and sixths at or near 7:9 and 7:12.</p><p>The sheer beauty and sophistication of Machaut&apos;s music can influence<br/>and has influenced musical style in tunings ranging from Pythagorean<br/>to 20-equal and indeed 13-equal under the right timbral conditions.<br/>The opening of the 21st century, an epoch sometimes with the ambience<br/>of its own Ars Nova, is a propitious opportunity to honor this<br/>composer of transcendent genius.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=41714 href="#41714">ðŸ”—</a>Joel Hickman &#x3C;joelhickman_1999@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/1/2003 12:38:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello everyone!!</p><p>   Are there any of his works in<br/>print?

Schrade. There&apos;s the famous Mass, the rich variety of<br/>French songs ranging from one to four voices, and also the very artful<br/>motets and his double hoquet (literally a &quot;hiccup&quot; piece, with the two<br/>upper voices truncating each other, a 13th-century technique to which<br/>Machaut gives a new flavor).</p><p>Interesting things can happen if one applies to Machaut a septimal<br/>(2-3-7-9) interpretation of the guidelines Marchettus of Padua gives<br/>in 1318 for intoning cadential progressions, a topic for another<br/>post.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=41763 href="#41763">ðŸ”—</a>Kyle Gann &#x3C;kgann@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2003 6:38:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo and others,</p><p>&gt;Please let me clarify that my post on Machaut<br/>&gt;expresses my own<br/>&gt;indebtedness to this composer as a source of my<br/>&gt;own style, and goes<br/>&gt;with a qualification well worth stating that<br/>&gt;tastes can vary.</p><p>I think I was probably guilty of grossly overstating, for effect, my reservations about our old friend Guillaume de Machaut. His Notre Dame Mass is a stunning achievement: I never get over how it seems to rise up out of history without comparable precedent, like Devil&apos;s Tower or that big rock down in Australia. Ciconia left us no similarly large-scale architectural achievement to compare with it. And I&apos;m very fond of several of Machaut&apos;s ballades and virelais, and his very striking use of the tritone in songs like, I think (I&apos;m writing without my vinyl collection nearby for reference) &quot;Amours me fait bien,&quot; or whatever it is. The little virelai whose refrain is the line &quot;Dieu! C&apos;est droit / Que je l&apos;aime sans blame(?)&quot; is heart-breakingly beautiful. Very charming, memorable music. It&apos;s mainly in what I see as the tremendous technical advances between Machaut&apos;s isorhythmic motets and those of Ciconia; in the comparison, it seems that music suddenly blossoms as an independent artform. Isorhythm yields more interesting musical results for Ciconia, seems to me, affecting the entire musical texture, and doesn&apos;t strike one as so &quot;mathematical.&quot; And there&apos;s no Machaut song I find quite as stunning as Ciconia&apos;s &quot;Una Panthera.&quot; Nevertheless, Machaut is a towering figure and an old favorite of mine. I&apos;d be thrilled to hear his music couched in some of Margo&apos;s tuning solutions.</p><p>Penitently,</p><p>Kyle</p></div>
