This is an opportune time for me to say<br/>a couple of brief things about the list...first, I have, and have always<br/>had, the higest respect for math...interestiingly enough, my dad,<br/>brother, and uncle are all very good mathematicians, so it&apos;s been around<br/>in my life a lot...it just isn&apos;t me. This sort of speculation gets deep,<br/>because I believe I got my &quot;right brain&quot; sort of attitude from my mom&apos;s<br/>side, where a great uncle was conductor of the Kansas City Symphony at<br/>one time, and my granny was a classical pianist...I find genetics quite<br/>fascinating, why we are the way we are. I am also an enormous Einstein<br/>fan...here&apos;s an interesting guy, who obviously knew something about<br/>math, but also had an ability (with his thought experiments), to bring<br/>very tough concepts down to a very simple place...that&apos;s for me.<br/>   People do change, hopefully for the better...I apologize here and now<br/>for any past bad vibes directed towards the math folks...I now feel very<br/>at peace with all that...all you theory guys who love lattices and all<br/>that...go for it, it&apos;s most likely a blast for you, and I&apos;m sure it is<br/>very meaningful....it sure isn&apos;t causing me any harm. On the other hand,<br/>the SOUND of music is my thing, and a knowledge of any sort of tuning<br/>theory is absolutely non essential for producing great music. Sure, it<br/>can point some paths to check out, but the 2 are unrelated. My analogy<br/>is martial arts...I studied many years with some very tough dudes, and I<br/>have a lot of theories about fighting..however, I AM NOT going to get<br/>into the ring and test my theories...I enjoy watching martial arts<br/>contests from the safety of my living room. And, I also must mention<br/>that I studied music theory very deeply for many years with a great<br/>bebop sax player....I love theory, I love speculation and learning new<br/>concepts...it&apos;s just that, as I am aging and developing more as a<br/>person, that my more intuitive side is gaining more prominence. We all<br/>have a balance of yin/yang, and I believe my approach to life is more<br/>yin at this point. Again, I have no problem with the math<br/>guys...Starrett is one of my best compadres in all of this, and he<br/>surely qualifies as a math guy...yet, we meet in a place where the<br/>sounds of music take precedence, and we have, and will continue to, make<br/>some great (I hope so) music together.<br/>   I am always sorry to see folks calling each other foul names...geez,<br/>when that happens, of COURSE the other party is going to have a heated<br/>response...that is a line that should not be crossed, and when someone<br/>does it, in an earlier time (or read Dune), one could be &quot;called out,&quot;<br/>and loss of life was emminent. A respect for each other as humans is<br/>essential, and those that disrespect it have a problem that they need to<br/>deal with, post haste.<br/>   As far as yin/yang, we often see Partch&apos;s name mentioned as a great<br/>pioneer, and rightly so...but, Ivor Darreg was also a great pioneer, and<br/>rarely recieves mention here...I believe he was yin to Partch&apos;s yang,<br/>and the basic tone of this list is very yang and intellectual...thus,<br/>Partch. Ivor was a great influence on me because of his basic concepts,<br/>the most important being that each tuning has it&apos;s own MOOD, or<br/>feeling...indeed, this is a profound concept, quite true, and points the<br/>way towards the making of music...Ivor was not much of a technician, to<br/>be sure, but his &quot;Detwelvulate&quot; CD is a favorite of mine because of the<br/>FEELING in it.<br/>   And, that brings me to a parting suggestion...how about all you math<br/>guys talking about your passion for music itself, separate from the<br/>math? What moves you in the field of music? What are you wanting to<br/>experience, feel, when you put a CD on? For example, when I listen to<br/>Bartok&apos;s &quot;Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta,&quot; it&apos;s like seeing<br/>the storm of WW 2 brewing on the horizon in Europe...it&apos;s an experience<br/>beyond music itself...same when I hear Hendrix play &quot;Machine Gun;&quot; it&apos;s<br/>like seing a battlefield in the Vietnam war. Marty Robbin&apos;s music is<br/>like going to the movies for me, it&apos;s totally visual...I could go on.<br/>So, what do some of you other folks get from listening? Thanks for<br/>reading this, I hopwe folks chill out and get into the peaceful and<br/>profound pursuits which music and tuning can provide all of us...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=13300 href="#13300">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2000 1:16:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Very inspiring post, Neil.  I&apos;d love to share a few words on the topic.</p><p>I got into music because it seems so cool- it&apos;s only there (like all art<br/>I guess) because it&apos;s beautiful.  It&apos;s a way for humans to share what we<br/>find beautiful.  It seems unlike the other arts, though (and I&apos;m not the<br/>first to point this out), in that it takes sound to a whole new level on<br/>this earth.  A visual artist may show us something that&apos;s never been seen<br/>(like the fantasy of a Roger Dean painting) or even a new way to see (like<br/>a Picasso or Van Gough), but it never really seems to compare to the<br/>fantastic visual detail around us.  Computer graphics are getting there,<br/>I guess (if you&apos;ve ever seen the movie Antz).  Architecture gives us a<br/>new way to live -- an artificial environment -- but on balance, I&apos;ve<br/>always preferred the woods (where my waste is recycled and the food and<br/>air are fresher, and, the latest science informs us, more healthful).</p><p>Music, on the other hand, is definitely at the top of its game.  There<br/>are those who may prefer the sound of a running stream, or a traffic jam,<br/>but I&apos;m not one of them.  To me the greatest sound on this earth is the<br/>sound of human voices singing in just intonation.  I like to imagine that<br/>animals like dogs and cats experience pure bliss when they hear human<br/>music.  I even played a concert about this, called _Chorus in the Cello_.<br/>I used the cello register of my piano, which can sound a lot like a tenor<br/>voice, and tried to play what a human choir might sound like if you<br/>couldn&apos;t understand the words.  There are many stories of angelic choirs.<br/>For an agnostic like me, angelic choirs are human ones.</p><p>I&apos;m allergic to cats, and I don&apos;t really like them.  But when I lived in<br/>Berkeley and had no piano to play, and my neighbor let me use his<br/>Steinway, I had to put up with his cat.  But I soon grew to love that<br/>cat, because when I played, it stretched out on top of the piano, on its<br/>back, and hung its head over the fall board, and looked right at me with<br/>its blue eyes.  It would stay there for hours while I played.  I would<br/>try to imagine what it must be like to hear that, while feeling it<br/>vibrate all around and through you.  And if I ever wanted the cat to<br/>leave, I would simply switch to harpsichord (they _hate_ it!).  :)</p><p>For me, music is one of the richest things in life.  Take Beethovan&apos;s<br/>late string quartets, a good Bach fugue, or some extended YES tunes.<br/>I&apos;ve also heard &quot;ethnic&quot; music from Africa, India, and Persia that I<br/>simply couldn&apos;t believe.</p><p>The kind of thing I&apos;m saying seems to be supported, somewhat, by recent<br/>experiments where listening to &quot;complex&quot; music (Mozart is only one<br/>example) temporarily improves scores on spatial reasoning tests.  I<br/>first learned of those experiments from an article Erv Wilson gave me.<br/>He&apos;s into this aspect of music, too.</p><p>I guess what I&apos;m saying is, I see music as one of the best things about<br/>being human, and thus as one of the best things to be involved with as a<br/>human, to improve humanity if such is possible.  Take Beethovan&apos;s Ode to<br/>Joy -- a celebration of the fact that all humans experience, from time to<br/>time, the feeling of joy, and isn&apos;t that great?  Sure, the work is over<br/>played, but if I can live 150 years after it was written and still get<br/>that out of it, then wow!</p><p>I got into tuning because it seems like the natural concern of a good<br/>musician.  From my earliest memory, I can remember wondering what gave<br/>Barbershop quartets and boys&apos; choirs that special sound.  When I found<br/>out about just intonation, I was shocked.  I can still remember the first<br/>time I heard the familiar Barbershop, not as a timbre, but as a locked<br/>7-limit chord.  I was _really_ shocked.  I can still remember the first<br/>time Denny played his 15-limit slide guitar for me.  I was blown away.<br/>I knew I was on to something, but that I&apos;d have to learn as much as I<br/>could if I was going to synthesize these new materials into good music<br/>in my lifetime.</p><p>You said, Neil, that theory didn&apos;t have anything to do with making good<br/>music, and I can see what you&apos;re saying.  But it only applies to the guy<br/>who&apos;s had a 19-tone guitar dropped in his lap -- or, for that matter, a<br/>12-tone one!  I&apos;ve made outstanding music on the top of an empty can of<br/>Pavich organically-grown Jumbo Thompson seedless raisins... but I think I<br/>prefer polyphonic instruments that approximate just intonation (with a<br/>raisin-can holding down the beat, of course!).</p><p>A 19-tone guitar may be about the same as a 12-tone one, but consider the<br/>piano.  The white keys make a strong statement.  They suggest there&apos;s<br/>something special about the diatonic scale.  I&apos;m a keyboardist in search<br/>of an instrument, and it will be expensive.  I want to choose carefully.<br/>That&apos;s why I&apos;m on this list, trying to understand all this stuff.  I still<br/>believe that the raw materials of 11-limit JI are enough to keep me<br/>occupied making awesom music for many years, but I&apos;m becoming convinced<br/>that organizing these materials a bit before I start will be worth my<br/>time.  When I get there, we&apos;ll have to jam!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=13326 href="#13326">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2000 9:54:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil and Carl, wonderful testimonials, both of you!  Here&apos;s my stab.</p><p>Music has been a passion for me since long before I knew the meaning<br/>of the word &quot;passion&quot;.  At about age three, in church, I remember a<br/>particular passage from &quot;Onward Christian Soldiers&quot;, where the words<br/>are &quot;forward into battle&quot;, and the dyads are something like F-A,<br/>(falling) C-G, A-F, (then back up) C-G, F-A; that progression seemed<br/>very vivid and lovely.   The rest of church was a complete and utter<br/>bore to me (something which, for good or ill, has changed little over<br/>time).</p><p>My grandfather had huge 78 RPM records, 14 or 15 inches across, with<br/>various light classics.  One passage, I think from a Sousa march (!),<br/>always made me think of a graveyard at night with some spirit floating<br/>nearby - again very vivid.</p><p>My dad rebuilt an old reed pump organ, and I played by ear, hymns and<br/>popular tunes.  I figured out tonic, subdominant, dominant relationships<br/>(without, of course, knowing their names).  Relative minors (ditto).<br/>Inversions.  Sharps and flats associated with each key.  Perfect and<br/>plagal cadences.  It&apos;s all right out there for intuitive understanding.<br/>Piano lessons did not stick: I found the drills stiflingly boring, when<br/>I could already play songs by ear, with harmony.  Of course, I missed<br/>out on learning good keyboard fingering technique by failing to follow<br/>through on lessons!</p><p>Somewhere, long ago, my older brother Emerson introduced me to the math<br/>of Just Intonation.  I have no idea where he found it, or exactly how<br/>old we were.  Teenagers, I suppose.  But I didn&apos;t actually hear JI<br/>till much later, in my 40&apos;s, when I used pitch bends to produce it on a<br/>Korg M1.  Beginning in the early &apos;90&apos;s, and working completely in a<br/>vacuum, I started writing real-time dynamic retuning software.  A year<br/>and a half ago I found the tuning list, learned words like &quot;5-limit&quot; and<br/>&quot;7-limit&quot; for the first time, and abandoned for the moment real-time<br/>tuning in favor of &quot;leisure&quot; tuning (having the whole sequence available<br/>for consideration).</p><p>I am by now completely hooked on the sound of (quasi) JI, and listen to<br/>it every day.  My own works, such as they are, and retunings of<br/>sequences I happen to like.  Especially when well tuned, music has a<br/>sweetness and purity which, to me, no other living experience<br/>approaches.  It has no calories, won&apos;t get anyone pregnant or sick; it<br/>does not fatigue; it requires no exertion yet demands one&apos;s willing<br/>attention; it engages, relaxes, and satisfies like nothing else.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=13356 href="#13356">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2000 10:26:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil Haverstick wrote,</p><p>&gt; As far as yin/yang, we often see Partch&apos;s name mentioned as a<br/>greatpioneer, and rightly so...but, Ivor Darreg was also a great<br/>pioneer, and rarely recieves mention here...I believe he was yin to<br/>Partch&apos;s yang, and the basic tone of this list is very yang and<br/>intellectual...thus, Partch.</p><p>Great post Neil! I really like your Partch/Darreg analogy, and I<br/>agree -- though I might&apos;ve said Partch via Helmholtz; there was an<br/>awful lot to Partch (so to speak), and for the most part it&apos;s the<br/>Helmholtz part that most frequents the list... In fact, with the<br/>pro/con harmonic entropy threads making so many headlines lately<br/>&lt;grinning thing&gt;, some might find it instructive to check out chapter<br/>X (specifically the &quot;degree of harmoniousness of consonances&quot; section)<br/>of Helmholtz&apos; &quot;On the Sensations of Tone&quot;.</p><p>In this one bit he offers amongst other things a dyadic &quot;intensity of<br/>influence&quot; measure; that&apos;s 100/(n*d) for short (see p. 187), and what<br/>I&apos;m sure must be the original &quot;one footed bride&quot;/&quot;harmonic entropy&quot;<br/>styled attempt to model dyadic consonance (or &quot;concordance&quot;) across<br/>the pitch continuum. Of these beautiful and -- to anyone who&apos;s been<br/>following the harmonic entropy threads -- familiar looking graphs (see<br/>p. 193) he wrote, &quot;to obtain a general graphical representation of the<br/>complicated relations which co-operate to produce the effect, I have<br/>made such a calculation, knowing that diagrams teach more at a glance<br/>than the most complicated descriptions&quot;. I can just see Joe Monzo<br/>nodding his head in approval now! (BTW -- note to Joe Monzo: I think<br/>paragraphs three and four on page 194 would offer an excellent<br/>&quot;classic&quot; psychoacoustic definition of discordance and concordance;<br/>all the more so as he uses the terms dissonance and consonance...<br/>perhaps it would be a good way to set up the distinctions in the<br/>tuning dictionary?).</p><p>Anyway, I think it is this prudent, scientific influence in the<br/>tradition of Helmholtz, or Partch via Helmholtz, that probably best<br/>typifies the Erlichian or Keenanesque vibe of the list. Personally I&apos;m<br/>grateful for the degree of quality control that results from the<br/>occasionally curt &quot;technical policing&quot;... but then again I&apos;m also the<br/>type who would like to know if something I&apos;m saying or doing tuning<br/>theory wise is technically out of whack, and I don&apos;t think I could<br/>find a better place for that than this very list (thanks in large part<br/>to Paul Erlich&apos;s persistency and diligence). The occasional clashing<br/>of the &quot;technocrats&quot; and the &quot;feel&quot; guys is always going to occur, and<br/>I think (and as David Finnamore just pointed out) that simply by its<br/>very nature this type of a forum better sustains technical, as opposed<br/>to aesthetic, discourse... but I see no reason why there wouldn&apos;t be<br/>room enough for everyone who&apos;s got something to say to say it on the<br/>list the way the it presently operates. I also think of John<br/>Starrett&apos;s <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site as an indispensable tuning list &quot;satellite&quot;.<br/>Many a list member has their music there to be shared in the same way<br/>that the technical oriented discourse is shared at the tuning list<br/>proper.</p><p>Former tuning lister Jeff Collins kindly sent me an Ivor Darreg<br/>&quot;video&quot; a while back, and it was chockfull of quirky homespun warmth<br/>and about a bazillion wonderful oddly detwelveulated devices! Neil<br/>definitely hits the mark when he says &quot;he was yin to Partch&apos;s yang&quot;!<br/>But that&apos;s not to say that he wasn&apos;t an effective or astute author of<br/>tuning theory, as that&apos;s hardly the case; Brian McLaren has sent me<br/>some photocopies of Darreg&apos;s written material, and I&apos;ve always found<br/>it to be clear and very informative. But the very idea that he could<br/>coin an archetypal tuning term at once as nebulous and inimitably<br/>useful as &quot;moods&quot; speaks volumes for his experience based,<br/>straightforward approach. Lots of fun and very inspiring.</p><p>Anyway, keep yingin&apos; and keep yangin&apos;!,</p><p>  - dan</p></div><h3><a id=13363 href="#13363">ðŸ”—</a>Dale Scott &#x3C;adelscott@mail.utexas.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2000 2:24:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John A. deLaubenfels wrote:</p><p>&gt;Music has been a passion for me since long before I knew the meaning<br/>&gt;of the word &quot;passion&quot;.

I&apos;m sure this<br/>has something to do with how &quot;catchy&quot; its sound is to the ear;<br/>John&apos;s relation of his experience of it as being the one thing that<br/>was interesting to him about a church service when he was a toddler<br/>is a nice testament to that catchy effect.</p><p>But what I&apos;m wondering is, why *is* it so catchy? Is it merely that<br/>the device is isomorphic to a goodly portion of the harmonic series,<br/>or could any of the following factors have something to do with it:</p><p>--the alternation of imperfect and perfect consonances?<br/>--the implied alternation between two triads a fifth apart?<br/>--the similar motion of the two parts?<br/>--the expanding and contracting size of the interval?</p><p>And I wonder if anyone else would agree that the particular instance<br/>of the horn fifth in this hymn is more catchy than just any old horn<br/>fifth because of the fact that the implied two triads a fifth apart<br/>are the tonic and subdominant in the key (whereas the same device<br/>on the tonic and dominant doesn&apos;t seem to me like it would have quite<br/>the same effect). In other words, does the tonal implications of the<br/>passage as more-or-less a prolongation of the dominant harmony in the<br/>hymn contribute to the catchiness?</p><p>I think if the answer is &quot;yes&quot; this demonstrates an important<br/>relationship between music and those two other things that together<br/>with it form a great triumvirate of passions in my life: food and sex.<br/>For while the music has a great urge to move toward the dominant and<br/>finally come to a rest on the tonic after &quot;see his banners flow,&quot;<br/>the vacillation between the subdominant and the contrapuntal tonic<br/>chord has an irresistable quality all its own, much like the moment<br/>just as one takes a swig of a good beverage right after a heavy meal,<br/>or like the moment just prior to an orgasm.

I remember reading about him hearing some particular 19-tET<br/>music and being vexed by the sound of these pieces, which he<br/>understandably attributed to their composer, only to later discover<br/>upon actually tuning and playing in 19 that he could easily recreate<br/>the vibe he had originally attributed to these pierces by simply<br/>playing the tuning.

Start simple - say 5 and 10 equal. Once<br/>you&apos;ve assimilated five, got it good and happening in your ear, can<br/>you then hear its characteristic &quot;mood&quot; in 10? Try the same with say 7<br/>and 14 equal... This is the basic idea.</p><p>Try rumaging around in the Brian Mclaren archives at:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/mclarens_posts.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/mclarens_posts.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Brian is (to my mind) an engaging and prolific writer on the topic of<br/>microtonality.

I think his main point was that there was<br/>no reason to not explore a certain ET, just because &apos;theory&apos;<br/>says that it&apos;s useless from the standpoint of JI approximations,<br/>etc.  Every ET has compositional possibilities because each<br/>one has its own valid mood to explore.</p><p>McLaren is no doubt the main person carrying on the Darreg<br/>tradition - indeed he has devoted a *lot* of work to assembling<br/>Darreg&apos;s work into a website that hopefully we&apos;ll see some day<br/>soon.

The nearest low-integer ratios to it are 11/5<br/>[= ~165 cents], 35/32 [== 5^1*7^1 = ~155 cents], and 12/11<br/>[= ~151 cents].</p><p>But you&apos;re right to observe that the other ones are rather<br/>closer, maybe not so much to 12-tET, but to ratios we know.<br/>It&apos;s interesting to observe what familiar intervals these<br/>&apos;weird&apos; ones approximate...</p><p>The 5^(1/31) step-size of ~90 cents is nearly identical to<br/>the 256/243 [== 3^-5] &apos;limma&apos; version of the &apos;semitone&apos; in<br/>Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>The 5^(1/25) step-size of ~111 cents is very close to the<br/>16/15 semitone of 5-limit JI [= ~112 cents].</p><p>But note that neither of these non-&apos;8ve&apos; ETs has any special<br/>resemblance to the respective JI approximations *as a whole*,<br/>because both Pythagorean and 5-limit scales have *two* versions<br/>of the semitone, and McLaren&apos;s scales only have one.<br/>So they still sound &apos;weird&apos; (and beautiful).</p><p>The 17^(1/21) step-size of ~234 cents is quite close to the<br/>septimal &apos;whole tone&apos; of 8/7 [= ~231 cents].

Brian<br/>and Johnny Reinhard stand out as the two who have composed in<br/>more different kinds of tunings than anyone else I know of.</p><p>Brain has also composed pieces in every ET from 5 to 53, and<br/>if you think La Monte Young uses high-prime JI, track 12 of<br/>McLaren&apos;s _Microtonal Music, Volume 6_ is in 641-limit JI,<br/>and track 15 is in 3067-limit JI!</p><p>(In case Paul Erlich is ready to dispute the relevance of a<br/>JI limit this high, I&apos;ll emphasize now that this is *precisely*<br/>McLaren&apos;s point:  we can&apos;t hear anything in these tunings<br/>that has anything to do with their supposed numerical qualities,<br/>because these large numbers are too close to the small ones<br/>which *do* have such a powerful affect.)</p><p>Mostly he just likes to find an interesting mathematical construct,<br/>then tune up his intruments and compose pieces expoloring what<br/>they sound like.  Mostly I see him as a great adventurer, sort<br/>of a Magellan of microtonality.  His intent is definitely to<br/>open up the &apos;Western&apos; world&apos;s ears to *non*-12-tET in every<br/>way possible.</p><p>I think McLaren&apos;s real point of departure is Darreg&apos;s observation<br/>that each tuning has its own &apos;mood&apos;, and that regardless of<br/>supposed psychoacoustical relevance or irrelevance, *every*<br/>tuning has more-or-less unique compositional possibilities.</p><p>I say &apos;more-or-less unique&apos; because when one begins working<br/>with as many different tunings as McLaren (and Reinhard, and<br/>Dan Stearns), one begins to perceive the &apos;family&apos; relationships<br/>between different tunings.  For example, 5-, 10-, 15-, 10-,<br/>and 25-tET all have some intervals in common, so there are<br/>sounds common to all of them that can be used to portray these<br/>&apos;familial&apos; relationships.</p><p>A &apos;natural&apos; step-size for scales?<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>&gt; &lt;...&gt; and perhaps it also indicates that there is a kind<br/>&gt; of &quot;natural&quot; step size to scales (somewhere around 100 cents<br/>&gt; maybe) that make pitch differentiation meaningful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dunno.  Just something to think about.</p><p>That&apos;s an interesting observation.  But if anyone asked me what<br/>I thought was a &apos;natural&apos; scale step size, I&apos;d probably be<br/>inclined to answer in terms of some kind of pentatonic scale<br/>system, because a *lot* of music all over the world and for<br/>centuries (millenia?), right down to present-day pop music,<br/>has made use of pentatonic scales most of the time.  So I&apos;d<br/>be much quicker to say that the &apos;natural&apos; step size is somewhere<br/>between a &apos;major 2nd&apos; [= ~200 cents] and &apos;minor 3rd&apos; [= ~300<br/>cents].</p><p>I think it&apos;s perhaps even more interesting that I can&apos;t make<br/>a decision between these two:  the &apos;natural&apos; scales seem more<br/>often to contain *two* step-sizes rather than one, whether<br/>they&apos;re pentatonic or heptatonic (= diatonic).  Of course I&apos;m<br/>generalizing here, but the concept is one worth exploring<br/>- Dan Stearns posts a lot on this.</p><p>The &apos;complete set&apos; of McLaren non-&apos;8ve&apos; ETs<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>Here&apos;s a table of all the non-&apos;8ve&apos; ETs used by McLaren in the<br/>CDs I have by him:</p><p>(The &apos;vol.trk&apos; column gives the volume number of the CD in<br/>McLaren&apos;s &apos;Microtonal Music series, and track number of the<br/>composition.

Gladja enjoyed it!</p></div><h3><a id=13790 href="#13790">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>9/29/2000 11:53:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gary Morrison wrote,</p><p>&gt; Another musician coworker friend (a saxophonist with a big-band jazz<br/>background if that matters - probably not) had a somewhat similar<br/>impression from hearing 88CET music.

I really think that tunings, no matter how &quot;bizarre&quot; or<br/>removed from what most folks know (or even like), are easier to retain<br/>(and acquire &quot;meaning&quot;) if they are tethered to some memorable (or<br/>striking) music.</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div>
