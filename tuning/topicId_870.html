Acustica 24, 126-136</p><p>The frequencies of a sinusoidal tone and of a complex tone with the<br/>same pitch are slightly different. The investigations show that<br/>usually the pitch of a complex tone is lower than the pitch of<br/>sinusoidal tone of the same (fundamental) frequency. The frequency<br/>ratio corresponding to the subjectively correct pitch interval of a<br/>musical octave usually differs slightly from the value 2. This<br/>phenomenon was investigated with low pure tones and with complex<br/>tones. The results for complex tones are explained by the octave<br/>intervals that were found with simple tones and the pitch differences<br/>between simple and complex tones.</p><p>These conclusions were revisited here:</p><p>Terhardt, E., Grubert, A. (1987). Factors affecting pitch judgments<br/>as a function of spectral composition. Percept. Psychophys. 42, 511-<br/>514</p><p>Stimulated by a recent paper by Platt &amp; Racine [Perception &amp;<br/>Psychophysics 38, 543-553 (1985)], we discuss the factors that<br/>probably are involved in certain inconsistencies observed in pitch<br/>judgments of tones with different spectral composition. Typically,<br/>discrepancies reported in the literature are of the order of 10 cents<br/>in magnitude. We point out that measurement of such small pitch<br/>effects is heavily dependent on systematic individual differences;<br/>and, when individual differences are averaged out (as is essentially<br/>the case in Platt &amp; Racine&apos;s experiments), verification of the actual<br/>auditory stimulus SPL within a few dB is necessary. Utilizing the<br/>virtual-pitch theory, we evaluate the effects of frequency, SPL, and<br/>earphone frequency response. Further, we present experimental and<br/>theoretical data on pitch of piano tones relevant to the problem. The<br/>study elucidates that, taking into account the factors mentioned,<br/>agreement between the various data considered, as well as theoretical<br/>understanding, actually is much better than may have become apparent<br/>on first sight.</p><p>In Terhardt, E.

ISBN 3-540-63408-<br/>8, pp. 353-356 describe how, in many cases, the pitch of the harmonic<br/>complex tone turns out to be slightly lower than that of the pure<br/>tone.</p><p>Webster, J.C., Miller, P.H., Thompson, P.O., Davenport, E.W. (1952).<br/>The masking and pitch shifts of pure tones near abrupt changes in a<br/>thermal noise spectrum J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 24, 147-152</p><p>When a pure tone is mixed with a noise of uniform spectrum, its<br/>threshold is sraised. At levels above threshold, its loudness and<br/>pitch are changed by the presence of the noise. Introducing abrupt<br/>changes in the slope of the noise spectrum by filtering out<br/>(rejecting) one octave changes these effects in the vicinity of this<br/>gap. The masked threshold for a pure tone varies from the value for<br/>unfiltered noise at the edges of the gap to a value approximately 25<br/>dB lower at the middle. This indicates that gappedi-noise may be used<br/>to mask out sounds outside of the gap without unduly raising the<br/>threshold of sounds in the gap. Presence of white noise generally<br/>raises the pitch of a pure tone whose frequency is between 500 and<br/>4000 cps. Presence of noise with the gap does not raise the pitch of<br/>a pure tone located in the upper half of the gap. For a tone located<br/>in the lower half of the gap, the pitch is raised more than it would<br/>be in the presence of unfiltered noise. The changes in the judged<br/>loudnessof pure tones partially masked by a gapped-noise reaffirm the<br/>importance of the tails of the excitation pattern in their effect on<br/>loudness.</p><p>Webster, J.C., Schubert, E.D.

In the ear in which the standard tone was heard<br/>various types of hearing loss were simulated by masking noises. The<br/>pitch tended to shift away from a region of hearing loss to a region<br/>of no, or less hearing loss. Downward shifts were observed but were<br/>never as marked as the upward shifts.</p><p>Allanson, J.T., Schenkel, K.D. (1965). The effect of band-limited<br/>noise ond the pitch of pure tones. J. Sound Vib. 2, 402-408</p><p>An investigation has been made of the effect of a band of noise, one-<br/>third of an octave wide, on the perceived pitch of a pure tone. In<br/>general, the pitch was found to &quot;move away&quot; from the interfering<br/>noise. However, in contrast with the results of erlier workers, the<br/>shifts in pitch were found to be quite small and it is suggested that<br/>this may be due to the difference in experimental procedures</p></div>
