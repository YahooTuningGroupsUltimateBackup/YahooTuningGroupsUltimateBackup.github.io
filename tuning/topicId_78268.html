Otherwise,<br/>everything else is just an academic exercise. I think it&apos;s about time<br/>other people decided what they want rather than floundering about with<br/>&quot;horses for courses&quot; which works in the interests of the 12tet status<br/>quo which would have things remain the same. If you prefer other<br/>numbered tets then that is fine. Some of the so-called experts need<br/>to make a decision so that young people don&apos;t remain confused with all<br/>the ideas proposed by experts. I say 22 or 100tet. What do you say?</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/21/2008 10:09:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;robert thomas martin&quot;<br/>&lt;robertthomasmartin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I say 22 or 100tet.

Greetings Monz. I&apos;ve only been connected to the<br/>  internet for about a year and I am relatively new to yahoo groups.<br/>  I have started another microtonal group at</p><p>  <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MicroMadeEasy/">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/MicroMadeEasy/</a></p><p>  which anyone is free to join.</p><p>  I prefer 22tet rather than 31; 48 and 41 rather than 46.<br/>  I like 53tet and consider it rather elegant;<br/>  And I prefer 84tet to 72.</p><p>  I prefer to use tet. I only saw the edo term in the last<br/>  year and thought it was a place in Japan.</p><p>  I don&apos;t really care very much for JI periodicity blocks.<br/>  I prefer using the partials of the 8th octave of the<br/>  harmonic series. 128/128 to 256/128.</p><p>  I like 100tet because it is easy to use and it produces<br/>  good meantone versions of just and septimal major as<br/>  well as many other interesting possibilities. There are<br/>  no decimal points to fiddle about with, all the notes are<br/>  12cents apart and any note can only be 6cents wrong (if<br/>  notes can ever be wrong). It is a decimal system which<br/>  can more easily be adapted to mathematical manipulation.<br/>  All in all I find it very good to work with and would<br/>  recommended it to beginners who don&apos;t know where to start,<br/>  those with a scientific bent and those who want to avoid<br/>  all the ratios, fractions and speculations coming thick<br/>  and fast from every Tom, Dick and Mary around the globe<br/>  (including myself).</p></div><h3>robert thomas martin &#x3C;robertthomasmartin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2008 10:37:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tony&quot; &lt;leopold_plumtree@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;robert thomas martin&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;robertthomasmartin@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tony&quot; &lt;leopold_plumtree@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I favor applying a metric system like coherence to the<br/>&gt; situation.<br/>&gt; &gt; That<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is, dividing a single fundamental unit by a single radix.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The octave could be that fundamental unit.

I&apos;m not saying this is any better or<br/>worse than 100.-edo, just throwing it out there.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2008 10:49:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Petr<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;   From Robert.
