I just noticed that the simplest 3- and 5-limit hexanies (1,3,9,81 and 1,3,5,9) possibly answer a riddle I&apos;ve been puzzling over<br/>for a while.  A lot of old European folk tunes - traditional tunes, I mean - sound pentatonic at first listen, but on analysis I find<br/>they are actually hexatonic.  For &quot;major&quot; melodies, either the 4th or 7th (diatonically speaking), but not both, will seemingly be<br/>&quot;added.&quot;  At first I thought they were just passing tones &quot;borrowed&quot; from the diatonic scale but that didn&apos;t hold up to further<br/>scrutiny.  Where, I wondered, did the sixth note come from?  Was this an intermediate stage between pentatonicism and diatonicism?  That<br/>makes no sense at all.</p><p>However, both of the above mentioned hexanies provide two modes each that seem to fit the rustic hexatonic scales nicely.  From what I<br/>hear, there is evidence of similar scales in Africa, though that may result from an imposed Western viewpoint.</p><p>Perhaps the tendency to &quot;suspend&quot; tonality explains why some of these melodies feel modal rather than tonal, even though they are in<br/>neither pentatonic nor diatonic modes.
