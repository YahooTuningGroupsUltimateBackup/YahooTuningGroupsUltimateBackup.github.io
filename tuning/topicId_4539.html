If &quot;meantone&quot;<br/>were customarily defined as a tuning with all regular fifths equal<br/>where _either_ the major or minor thirds are pure, then both 1/3-comma<br/>and 1/4-comma would uniquely qualify, but not 19-tet or 31-tet, their<br/>very close approximations.</p><p>However, such a definition of &quot;meantone&quot; seems rather uncommon to me,<br/>because temperaments where all regular fifths have the same size but<br/>neither major nor minor thirds are pure also routinely get included,<br/>for example Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma tuning. Here I might propose three<br/>ways in which &quot;meantone&quot; is typically used, the first two being more<br/>commonly used maybe in historical contexts and the third more<br/>typically among contemporary theorists (e.g. Paul Erlich):</p><p>(1) In the narrowest definition -- literal &quot;mean-tone&quot; -- meantone<br/>refers exclusively to the 1/4-comma temperament with pure major thirds<br/>at 5:4, where a regular major second (~193.155 cents) is equal to<br/>precisely the _mean_ of the 9:8 and 10:9 whole-tones of tertian just<br/>intonation which together form a 5:4 third. This definition would<br/>exclude 1/3-comma, of course, as well as 19-tet and 31-tet, etc.</p><p>(2) In a broader concept -- what I might call &quot;characteristic<br/>meantone,&quot; -- the term refers to a tuning where all regular fifths<br/>have the same size, and these fifths are tempered by a quantity<br/>somewhere around the range of 1/3-1/6 syntonic comma. This is the<br/>range typical for Renaissance and early 17th-century practice, where<br/>thirds are pure or quite close to pure (within 1/3-comma). Also, it is<br/>a range where &quot;Wolves&quot; occur, both diminished sixths and diminished<br/>fourths regarded as &apos;unplayable&apos; by 16th-17th century standards.</p><p>(3) In the broadest concept, meantone says simply that all regular<br/>fifths have the same size. Thus Pythagorean (0-comma meantone), 12-tet<br/>(~1/11-comma), and 17-tet (in effect ~-2/11-comma, with fifths this<br/>around _wider_ than just) are all meantone tunings, although not<br/>&quot;characteristic meantone tunings&quot; with thirds within about 1/3-comma<br/>of a pure 5:4 or 6:5. Incidentally, under this definition, Pythagorean<br/>is a meaning tuning but not, of course, a _temperament_ -- maybe we<br/>could call it a meantone untemperament &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Applying these criteria, we see that 19-tet and 31-tet are indeed<br/>&quot;meantone&quot; temperaments under definitions (2) and (3). These tunings<br/>have all regular fifths equal, and are within the range of<br/>&quot;characteristic meantone.&quot;</p><p>Strictly speaking, since 19-tet fifths (~7.22 cents narrower than 3:2)<br/>are tempered a tidge _more_ than 1/3-comma (~7.17 cents), not only<br/>these intervals but also the major thirds fall a hair (about 0.05<br/>cents) outside the &quot;within 1/3-comma of pure&quot; test -- but if we say<br/>&quot;not more than _about_ 1/3-comma from pure,&quot; this solves the problem.</p><p>In the case of 31-tet, of course (~5.18 cents of temperament, as<br/>opposed to ~5.38 cents for 1/4-comma with pure 5:4 thirds), we&apos;re near<br/>the center of the historical meantone range, and I don&apos;t see how we<br/>can say that this tuning is not &quot;meantone&quot; -- unless we follow<br/>definition (1) above, reserving the term for the unique case of<br/>1/4-comma and only exactly 1/4-comma.</p><p>Psychologically, I might guess, there could be a tendency somehow to<br/>regard a meantone tuning expressible as some neat fraction of a<br/>syntonic comma (e.g. not only 1/3-comma or 1/4-comma, but also<br/>2/7-comma or 1/5-comma, etc.) as more &quot;truly meantone&quot; than something<br/>like 19-tet or 31-tet, which can&apos;t be expressed so neatly. Could this<br/>be an example of how, even with such tunings as meantone where<br/>irrational ratios are unavoidable, integer ratios for the division of<br/>the syntonic comma may make a tuning look more &quot;legitimately&quot;<br/>meantone?</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>perlich@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx</h3><span>8/29/1999 3:07:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo wrote,</p><p>&gt;However, such a definition of &quot;meantone&quot; seems rather uncommon to me,<br/>&gt;because temperaments where all regular fifths have the same size but<br/>&gt;neither major nor minor thirds are pure also routinely get included,<br/>&gt;for example Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma tuning.
