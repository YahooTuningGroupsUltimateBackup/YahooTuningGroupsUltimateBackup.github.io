BUT, my husband is.<br/>My husband who was formally trained in Boston, Mass is going back to<br/>school for graphic design, in which case this leaves us a with an<br/>out-of-print copy of Owen H. Jorgensen&apos;s book: TUNING: The<br/>perfection of eighteenth-century temperament, the lost art of<br/>ninteenth century temperment and the science of equal temperament.<br/>Complete with Instructions for autral and electronic tuning. Whew!<br/>That&apos;s a long title.<br/>So it brings me here in search of a piano tuner, or book collector,<br/>in need of this book that can&apos;t seem to be found... ANYWHERE! I do<br/>not have an exact price in  mind, but I plan to sell it to the<br/>highest bidder. Sound like ebay? Well for anyone interested I have<br/>an ebay account as well as a paypal account which I can recieve<br/>documented payments through, so there&apos;s no need to worry about<br/>losing money.<br/>Now I realize the purpose of this board is NOT to advertise and sell<br/>things, but I thought where else can I find a bunch of people<br/>looking for this book? And since you all seem to know a whole lot<br/>more than me, here I am. I had also noticed some posts on the board<br/>itself about the book being out-of-print and many seemed to be<br/>disappointed they wouldn&apos;t be able to get a copy. So that is where I<br/>come in.<br/>If you are interested, the book is in practically brand new<br/>condition and I would be willing to send pictures to anyone<br/>interested. Please contact me @ <a href="mailto:megdanmak@sbcglobal.net">megdanmak@sbcglobal.net</a> and for<br/>those of you wondering about my &quot;reputation&quot; you can go to ebay and<br/>look up the name: megdanmak and see that I have 102+ positive<br/>feedbacks which constitute the 100% positives I have. Thanks for<br/>your time.</p><p>Megan C.</p></div>
