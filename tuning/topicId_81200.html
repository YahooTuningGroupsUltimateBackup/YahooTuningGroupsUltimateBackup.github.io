Sometimes these can be proved/disproved<br/>&gt; but often they cannot (we had several examples recently). In these<br/>&gt; technical-topic mailing lists I mentioned this does very rarely<br/>&gt; happen. For example, when you discuss the semantics of some existing<br/>&gt; programming language there cannot be any value judgement whatsoevery.<br/>&gt; This can only come is when discussing some speculative extension/<br/>&gt; change to/of the existing language -- which happens less often in<br/>&gt; these technical mailing lists, but is the standard case here<br/>&gt; (proposal of new tunings, new speculative theory etc).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another problem on this list might be that people are often very<br/>&gt; devoted to some point of view, in particular if it cannot be proved/<br/>&gt; disproved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let me be clear that I don&apos;t feel being devoted to some view or value<br/>&gt; judgement is necessarily a problem as such. However, if some view<br/>&gt; cannot be proved/disproved then I suggest as a rule for discussions<br/>&gt; we simply state that there is a difference which cannot be resolved<br/>&gt; and leave it there without discussing it further.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such a rule was likely suggested before already on this list, which<br/>&gt; begs the next question: if we agree on some rule, then how can we<br/>&gt; help it being observed. For example, in case of some heated debate<br/>&gt; where it is not possible to come to an agreement, someone else may<br/>&gt; send a brief message and suggest that this is the case to tone down<br/>&gt; the discussion...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best<br/>&gt; Torsten<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Carl<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The list is fine. Heated debate is what you would expect from<br/>intelligent people and tuning is a more philosophical issue than mere<br/>troubleshooting computer problems. Imposing &quot;rules of grammar&quot; is an<br/>old fashioned concept (invented by Frege and Russell) and is just a<br/>way of trying to reduce transcendental topics to a &quot;meat and potatoes&quot;<br/>type of scientific control and analysis, thereby killing them.<br/>Besides, only people with a specialized interest will join the list.<br/>And if some people don&apos;t like being criticised, then boo hoo.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>-Rick</p></div>
