I was looking around for ANOTHER<br/>&gt;Scala mapping file that would pertain, and wasn&apos;t finding it...  Now I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t have to.</p><p>Well you still might want to try the other keyboard mapping in my paper,<br/>which is a 12-tone mapping (octaves remain octaves), the full scale being<br/>known as the hexachordal dodecatonic scale. It gives you a symmetrical<br/>decatonic scale if you avoid B and F, and it gives you two different<br/>pentachordal decatonic scales if you avoid either (B and E) or (C and F).</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We are Moving!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div>
