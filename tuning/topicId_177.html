Even more<br/>&gt;puzzling to me is how people seem fond of the *exact* details of the<br/>&gt;original instrument, criticizing the electronic duplicate for not having<br/>&gt;some artifacts of the original which are of dubious value musically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;My own rather ears, which have been informally trained on large amounts of<br/>&gt;techno, and can pick out electronic timbres very well, find many<br/>&gt;traditional instruments to be of dubious quality to begin with. For<br/>&gt;example, while I love the rich sound of a grand piano, smaller pianos<br/>&gt;sound very cheap to me. Likewise, &apos;classical&apos; guitars sound very good to<br/>&gt;my ear, but regular &apos;acoustic&apos; ones just sound like cheap knockoffs of<br/>&gt;their very pure-sounding and versatile electric cousins.</p><p> I am quite new to this wonderful world of microtonal scales, however I<br/>am not new to this constant babble of acoustic vs electronic instuments.<br/>I mean no disrespect but am just stateing my point of veiw.<br/> To say any tone is more pure than another is rediculous. I have, for the<br/>last year, been working in the synth manufacturing biz and at the same<br/>time have taken up playing the Sitar. My days are spent with a K2500 and<br/>a piece of teak. What a Sitar does the K2500 never will. There is no way<br/>to account for room tempiture and the manner which a player sits, both<br/>have a profound effect on the tone of the instument. The state of your<br/>callouse for another exsample. At the same point the Sitar does not do<br/>what the K2500 is capable of. (particularly with the KDFX)<br/> The one thing I do find is both are equally life long persuits as<br/>instruments. Both offer and endless array of options and ways to approach<br/>what you are trying to create.<br/> I choose the tone I require for what I am composeing at that time. More<br/>often I choose an instruments whos limits I understand. (I have not been<br/>writting for Sitar or the K2500) Those effect the manner in which I<br/>compose. When will these silly comments about diffrent instuments<br/>electronic and acoustic end. If some one is attracted to electronic<br/>sounds then great. If acoustic fine, but to ever state any sound is more<br/>&quot;pure&quot;, or &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; is dumb. If you can hear it than it is<br/>pure, correct and natural. It is a sound.<br/>  A upright piano sounds like an upright piano. Thank god it doesn&apos;t<br/>sound like a grand. I would find that quite borring.<br/>  We build what we build with the materials we like. This is like saying<br/>my lincon logs are better than yours. A TX81Z is a capable of haveing a<br/>profound effect on a listener as the K2500 even though the K2500 have a<br/>much vaster (sorry couldn&apos;t resist) array of of ways controlling the<br/>sound. It has to with the composition and sensitivity that one uses with<br/>there instument. Same goes for cheap and exspensive guitars, basses,<br/>pianos, percussion ect.<br/>  Again this is not ment to get anyone in a huff, it is just my point of<br/>veiw. Also I just joined and only caught part of this thread. Well it is<br/>one way to say hi.<br/>  As I learn more about this meathod of organization I hope to be able to<br/>add more to the conversation of the group. For now I have lots of reading<br/>to do.<br/>  happy thinking<br/>jeff cordero</p></div><h3><a id=193 href="#193">ðŸ”—</a>csz@xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>1/7/1999 12:46:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gary Morrison wrote:<br/>=======<br/>   Let me ask you folks this question:  When URLs are cited in tuning-list<br/>messages, how many of you actually &quot;take them up on their offer&quot;?
