The incremental pitch numbers on the<br/>Alesis HR-16:B drum machine are arranged in a number line from -16<br/>through +15, and the &quot;pipe&quot; voice for example corresponds to harmonics<br/>16 through 47, giving eight complete octaves at 16 through 23, and a<br/>ninth that abruptly stops at 47/24. I think I&apos;ll see if I can&apos;t dig<br/>any of these up and try and post &apos;em up at the TuningPunk site<br/>someday... I do remember that the step writing and editing process was<br/>a mind numbingly tedious experience, but that the results were<br/>peculiar enough (to me) to (almost) justify the labor intensive<br/>interface.</p><p>Dan Stearns</p><p>BTW, awhile back I was scribbling away on the back of an envelope when<br/>I noticed a simple little something that I thought was very<br/>interesting - well to me anyway. If you take an overtone sequence as<br/>say h ... 2h-1, the undertone sequence, i.e., 2h-1 ... h (or 2h ...<br/>h+1 and h+1 ... 2h) will also be the superparticular ratios in the<br/>guise of a consecutive integer sequence where their sum is the equal<br/>temperament:</p><p>series 2-4</p><p>(4)   3   2<br/>    0   3    5<br/>    0 720 1200</p><p>  4    3   (2)<br/>0   4    7<br/>0 686 1200</p><p>series 3-6</p><p>(6)   5   4   3<br/>    0   5   9   12<br/>    0 500 900 1200</p><p>  6   5   4    (3)<br/>0   6  11   15<br/>0 480 880 1200</p><p>series 4-8</p><p>(8)  7   6   5   4<br/>   0   7  13  18   22<br/>   0 382 709 982 1200</p><p>  8   7   6   5   (4)<br/>0   8  15  21   26<br/>0 369 692 969 1200</p><p>(etc.)</p><p>So in other words I&apos;m letting &quot;h&quot; be the variable that represents any<br/>series number, and say h = 5, then 2h (i.e., 2*5) is 10, and 2h-1 is<br/>9. So if you then take the 2h-1...h, you have 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and if<br/>you now let these numbers represent fractions of their sum, i.e.,<br/>9/35, 17/35, 24/35, 30/35, 35/35ths of (a 1200&iuml;&iquest;&half;) octave, you can see<br/>that this is an ET mimicking a 5:6:7:8:9:10 series where the<br/>superparticular ratios and the uniquely articulated fractions of an<br/>octave both increase by consecutive increments of 1, i.e.,</p><p>9 = 6/5<br/>8 = 7/6<br/>7 = 8/7<br/>6 = 9/8<br/>5 = 10/9</p><p>Using the parenthetical example &quot;(or 2h ... h+1 and h+1 ... 2h)&quot; where<br/>h = 5, we&apos;d have 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, at 10/40, 19/40, 27/40, 34/40, and<br/>40/40, where 40 is the ET mimicking the 5:6:7:8:9:10 series, and the<br/>superparticular ratios and the fractions of an octave both increase by<br/>consecutive increments of 1 starting at 2h (as opposed to 2h-1):</p><p>10 = 6/5<br/>9  = 7/6<br/>8  = 8/7<br/>7  = 9/8<br/>6  = 10/9</p><p>Anyway, I found this little numerical curiosity (sort of a sideways<br/>analogue to something like Pythagorean perfect numbers in a way) to be<br/>very interesting even if I haven&apos;t found any practical utility for it.</p></div>
