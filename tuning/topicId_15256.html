I may have the 7 and upside-down 7 reversed . . .</p><p>Paul, your explanation of Johnston&apos;s + and - is correct,<br/>but yes, you do have the operation of the &apos;7&apos; backwards, and<br/>also the ratio is not correct.  The adjustment indicated<br/>by Johnston&apos;s numerical accidentals is always measured in<br/>relation to the 5-limit diatonic major scale.</p><p>I use ASCII symbols to represent Johnston&apos;s symbols up to<br/>11-limit as follows:</p><p>raise  lower  amount  ~cents</p><p>  +      -     81:80    21.5</p><p>  L      7     36:35    49</p><p>  ^      v     33:32    53</p><p>The capital &apos;L&apos; is supposed to represent the upside-down &apos;7&apos;,<br/>and the caret and lower-case &apos;v&apos; represent the respective arrows<br/>that Johnston uses for ratios containing 11 as a factor.<br/>&apos;Amount&apos; means the adjustment from the basic 5-limit scale.</p><p>For primes higher than 11 (Johnston&apos;s later music is 31-limit),<br/>the example of 7 is followed: the prime-number itself is used<br/>for the otonal (harmonic) adjustment, and the number is written<br/>upside-down for the utonal (subharmonic) adjustment.</p><p>Here, I&apos;ll use &apos;RU&apos; to mean &apos;right side up&apos; and &apos;UD&apos; to<br/>mean &apos;upside down&apos;:</p><p>    raise  lower  amount  ~cents</p><p>13   RU     UD    65:64    27</p><p>17   RU     UD    51:50    34</p><p>19   UD     RU    96:95    18</p><p>23   RU     UD    46:45    38</p><p>29   RU     UD   145:144   12</p><p>31   RU     UD    31:30    57</p><p>A good explanation of Johnston&apos;s notation is given in:</p><p>Fonville, John.  1991.<br/>&apos;Ben Johnston&apos;s Extended Just Intonation: A Guide for Interpreters&apos;.<br/>_Perspectives of New Music_ 29.2 [Summer], p 106-137.</p><p>There&apos;s an error (a simple typo) on p. 114:  Fonville says:</p><p>&gt; To raise the 4/3 (cent value 498) by 11/8, or 53 cents,<br/>&gt; one arrives at 551, the cent value of 11/8 notated F^.</p><p>The 4/3 is in fact raised by 33/32 (~53 cents), not 11/8,<br/>so that 4/3 *becomes* 11/8 (~551 cents).</p><p>Even tho I love Johnston&apos;s music and must acknowledge that<br/>his theories are very similar to my own, I want to emphasize,<br/>in agreement with Daniel Wolf, that Johnston&apos;s notation,<br/>while admirably compact, is needlessly complicated.  It forces<br/>the reader to understand the 5-limit lattice _a priori_ and<br/>to calculate all other prime-factor adjustments thru a 2-step<br/>process in relation to the 5-limit lattice.</p><p>Wolf and I both propose modifications of Johnston&apos;s ideas<br/>which utilize the linear 3-limit (Pythagorean) tuning as<br/>the _a priori_ basis, since &apos;standard&apos; notation developed<br/>on that basis anyway: each distinctive letter-name and all<br/>of the associated (and multiple) sharps and flats by themselves<br/>clearly indicate an extended Pythagorean system.  Use of prime-<br/>factor 5 is indicated by further accidentals (which are also<br/>required by Johnston anyway), and the other primes follow in<br/>a similar manner.</p><p>These systems have the big advantage of requiring _a priori_<br/>systemic knowledge only of the linear Pythagorean system: any<br/>pitch can be calculated by its relation to the Pythagorean tuning,<br/>which in turn can also be calculated from 1/1 by knowledge of the<br/>simple &apos;rules&apos; of the generating cycle of 4ths/5ths and the<br/>letter-names and sharps/flats.</p><p>For a detailed description of my version of this notation see:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm</a></p><p>Wolf&apos;s system is identical in concept and differs only in<br/>the symbols he uses to indicate the prime-factors: I use<br/>the primes themselves (like Johnston), accompanied by the<br/>prime&apos;s exponent, with negative or positive exponents indicating<br/>sharpening or flattening; Wolf uses various typographic symbols<br/>to indicate the primes and the operations.  His system is<br/>outlined in:</p><p>Wolf, Daniel. 1996.<br/>Letter in _1/1, the journal of the Just-Intonation Network_ 9:3<br/>[Summer], p 15.</p><p>All high-prime (5 and above) accidentals beyond the usual<br/>sharps and flats indicate clearly the adjustment for that pitch<br/>from the *Pythagorean* tuning, which is certainly a more &apos;natural&apos;<br/>mental calculation than Johnston&apos;s system, and in fact is the<br/>cause of Paul Erlich&apos;s mistake in thinking that Johnston&apos;s &apos;7&apos;<br/>accidental indicated a 64:63 adjustment.</p><p>Henry, you might want to try to talk this composer into letting<br/>you copy his score using one of these notation systems instead.<br/>In my opinion, it would ultimately encourage more performances,<br/>even tho at the present time I must admit that certainly more<br/>performers are familiar with Johnston&apos;s notation than with mine<br/>or Wolf&apos;s.</p><p>Perhaps the only way to make a microtonal notation more &apos;natural&apos;<br/>is to show its pitches&apos;s adjustments in relation to 12-tET,<br/>because that&apos;s the scale with which everyone is familiar,<br/>and because the accursed hardware and software designers insist<br/>on building it into every instrument and program they create.</p><p>But it&apos;s very difficult to indicate JI tunings *systematically*<br/>in relation to 12-tET, because of the inherent differences<br/>between ETs (which are closed systems) and JI (which are open,<br/>i.e., potentially infinite).</p><p>(I&apos;m wondering here if you&apos;re using notation software.  I use<br/>Finale, which is incredibly flexible, and it&apos;s still a bitch to<br/>notate JI music, which must be written as deviations from 12-tET.)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=15274 href="#15274">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
