I&apos;ve read your posts for some time and haven&apos;t seen a cogent word<br/>of music critique yet.<br/>&lt;</p><p>Which begs the question: since when is repeated use of the work &apos;suck&apos; to<br/>be considered &apos;cogent music critique&apos;?</p><p>I&apos;m a Californian and have lived in Europe for a decade now and would&apos;ve<br/>put La Monte Young on my list without reservation. Young is a friend of<br/>mine, and I do help to distribute his scores, so I am impartial, but I was<br/>drawn to his work on its own terms long before I knew him personally and<br/>there is certainly not a penny to made from the relationship.</p><p>As well as I can tell from the writings of Mr. Lumma, he has a very<br/>conservative and limited taste in music.  That&apos;s just fine, if a bit<br/>disappointing in someone so young, but youth alone is surely  no excuse for<br/>us having to suffer such an unwarranted public attack on the honest tastes<br/>and opinions of another person.</p></div><h3><a id=633 href="#633">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/1999 10:15:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 02/05/1999 11:29:43 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt;  From: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  [David Beardsley]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;+ the Enclosure series....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  I have every enclosure.

It didn&apos;t even seem to me to<br/>be minimalistic, in the sense that minimalistic music slowly evolves over<br/>time.  The Well-Tuned Piano didn&apos;t even seem to do that.  But as I say, I<br/>haven&apos;t even listened to but a quarter of it one single time, much less having<br/>listened to it many times intensely.  So maybe the problem is me.</p></div>
