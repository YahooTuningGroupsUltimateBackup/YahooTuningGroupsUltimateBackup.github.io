I play hindusthan<br/>&gt; classical music and must say i hear the &quot;microtonality&quot; of it<br/>&gt; distinctly in the meends of the notes.The constant drone of the<br/>&gt; tanpurra enables a more distinct realisation of said micro-intervals<br/>&gt; And as i have stated before Pandit Shankar&apos;s C sharp sounds amazingly<br/>&gt; close too 544hz or a 17/16 off a 64 cycle base regardless of the 3<br/>&gt; limit implications of traditional raag music. I think that it is<br/>&gt; significant yet i have done most of my tuning to his records by ear<br/>&gt; but when the Sa is a C sharp it sounds best at a 17/16.</p><p>Pat</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p></div>
