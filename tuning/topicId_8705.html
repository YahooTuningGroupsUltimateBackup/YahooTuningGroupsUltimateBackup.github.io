Since today was fairly loose, I was<br/>able to learn that the reason I was not able to open some of his .mid files<br/>is that they were not internally coded appropriately (according to the mac<br/>techie I talked to) and the suffix .mid is not sufficient in mac reading to<br/>override the internal flaw. (It&apos;s amazing what one can learn by waiting on<br/>hold for an hour and a half.) The mystery is why did six out of his eight<br/>files open nicely in QuickTime, while the two others only opened a blank IE<br/>window that would not go anywhere. The techie did not know about the IE<br/>browser reaction, but I didn&apos;t think it was worth the time to wait another<br/>hour and a half to find out what Microsoft had to say about it.</p><p>Okay. Here are my aural reactions to the files I could open. In a sense,<br/>this is a &quot;blind&quot; test because I don&apos;t have any info other than the file<br/>names Joe provided and I have no idea (in some cases) what the numbers mean.<br/>Here goes:</p><p>1. keenan. mid - harmless and familiar, a nice even control of dissonance<br/>but not &quot;in tune.&quot; The thirds are all a bit low and the roots in IV (I<br/>think) and V are flat.</p><p>2. 71-64-81.mid - I and IV generally agreeable, V7 like a french accordian.<br/>(That means: @^*#_*^%$)</p><p>3. 7I.mid - fantastic, lovely, wonderful, A+, ideal, real nice. :-)</p><p>4. 51-5-9.mid - a decent I and IV, the root (I think, or is it the seventh)<br/>obnoxiously sharp in the V7.</p><p>5. pythag.mid - a flat third in both the I and IV, and a ridiculous V7<br/>chord.</p><p>6. 1-4c-mt.mid - reasonable I and IV, a very flat leading tone in V7</p><p>Now that I have committed myself, I&apos;ll dig up Monz&apos;s notes and &quot;suffer&quot; the<br/>consequences.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
