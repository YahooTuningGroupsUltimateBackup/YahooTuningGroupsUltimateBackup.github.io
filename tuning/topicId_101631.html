(Not in so much detail<br/>that I could be tested on it, but I went through it all.)<br/>It&apos;s reasonably good.  There&apos;s an introduction to the ideas<br/>of tuning and quantitative dissonance that would be useful<br/>for somebody who for some reason didn&apos;t have a book with<br/>the same material.  There&apos;s also a good summary of the<br/>relevant group theory.  Then there are overviews of fields<br/>I&apos;m interested in but not familiar with, like pitch<br/>spelling (isomorphic to meantone adaptive tuning) and<br/>scientifically studied intonation.  There are citations to<br/>follow up and if she missed a few (like Wilson&apos;s MOS)<br/>that&apos;s understandable.</p><p>The original material on convexity is interesting.  The<br/>Scala archive search isn&apos;t a big part of it.  There&apos;s also<br/>a &quot;compactness&quot; that coincides with something I was<br/>thinking about and mentioned on tuning-math recently.</p><p>&gt; Quick note: If you search for &quot;meantone&quot; in this paper,<br/>&gt; you won&apos;t find anything, but that&apos;s because she spells it<br/>&gt; &quot;Mean-tone&quot;. She does mention it at least, and even<br/>&gt; mentions keyboards with &gt;12 keys per octave.</p><p>She also talks about &quot;note names&quot; a lot, such that they<br/>imply the meantone mapping.  (She seems to be inconsistent<br/>about whether schismatic ETs are valid or not.  See note 7<br/>on p.62 and its context.) Check out p.146 where the<br/>&quot;projections&quot; MIDI =&gt; note names =&gt; preferred intonation<br/>ignore meantone as an intonation target.  Also, the pieces<br/>used to test the pitch spelling are from the Baroque or<br/>later.  There&apos;s nothing about how preferred spellings might<br/>have changed over time, how editors may have overruled the<br/>composers&apos; spellings, or how spelling may have correlated<br/>with meantone tuning.</p><p>&gt; She mentions &quot;regular&quot; temperaments, but the only<br/>&gt; definition given is this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;A regular system is a tuning or a temperament in which<br/>&gt; all the fifths but one are of the same size (Barbour<br/>&gt; 1951).&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It appears she never considers regular temperaments with<br/>&gt; generators other than fifths.</p><p>There&apos;s also &quot;A temperament system that is generated by the<br/>fifth, such that all their notes can be arranged in a<br/>continuous series of equal fifths is defined by Bosanquet<br/>(1874a, 1874b) to be a regular system.&quot;</p><p>On p.59, &quot;Another way to attach note-names to an equal<br/>tempered division is to use another interval (than the<br/>fifth) as &lsquo;generator of note-names&rsquo;.&quot;</p><p>Generally, she&apos;s only interested in the existing note<br/>names, so alternative mappings are outside her remit.  She<br/>must know about them if she&apos;s been following tuning-math.</p><p>                        Graham</p></div>
