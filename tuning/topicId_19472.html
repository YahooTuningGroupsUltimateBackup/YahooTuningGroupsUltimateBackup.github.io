However I _welcome_ correction by those more<br/>knowledgable than myself esp. since I am trying to do the<br/>FAQ on this very issue.</p><p>I would say that if you want to put in frets, setting them<br/>up in real 50 cent quarter tones actually makes sense for<br/>a lute. You can continue to do string bends to get the<br/>actual note you want. And when you figure out if those<br/>actual notes are quarter tones or are actually just<br/>13-limit intervals or are in between, report back your<br/>real-life findings to the list PLEASE!!</p><p>&gt; I tend to think of the fretted pitches as points ready for<br/>&gt; microtonal adjustment via string bending.</p><p>Good for you! There is a bluegrass band around here called<br/>&quot;Blue Highway&quot;. You won&apos;t hear it on their albums, but in<br/>their concerts both the Dobro player and the mandolinist<br/>deliberately play in middle eastern scales by using string<br/>bends and they are quite proficient at doing so even at<br/>incredibly high speeds. All of their instruments are<br/>fretted normally. The Dobro player also likes to play<br/>Indian scales, simulating the polyphony of a sarod (a<br/>fretless North Indian lute with 4 melody strings &amp; 6 drone<br/>strings &amp; about 15 sympathetic strings; a large, wide<br/>metal covered neck &amp; parchment covered belly.)</p><p>PS - I welcome discussion and correction from list members<br/>who unlike me actually have real experience with middle<br/>eastern music. Any rebab players out there?</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
