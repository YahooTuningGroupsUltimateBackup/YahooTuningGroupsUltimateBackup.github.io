That marriage began when Pythagoras described pleasing musical intervals with simple mathematical ratios more than 2,600 years ago and further evolved during the Middle Ages when deep thinkers used those same ratios to model the &ldquo;music of the spheres&rdquo; -- what many at that time believed to be the literally harmonious movements of the sun, moon and planets.&quot; ...</p><p>&quot;Understanding and interpreting music, say the authors of the study, is a process of discarding information -- which in turn is the key to discovering its underlying mathematical structure.&quot; ...</p><p>&quot;&ldquo;My fellow researchers and I have found it thrilling to discover unexplored areas of mathematics in the course of solving musical problems,&rdquo; Callender said.<br/>&ldquo;Professor Callender and his colleagues at Yale and Princeton are working at the forefront in this rarified area of music theory,&rdquo; said Don Gibson, dean of the FSU College of Music. &ldquo;Their research -- and its publication in Science -- represents a signal achievement in the discipline.&rdquo; &quot;</p><p><a href="http://unicomm.fsu.edu/pages/releases/2008_04/18_geometrical_music_theory.html">http://unicomm.fsu.edu/pages/releases/2008_04/18_geometrical_music_theory.html</a></p><p>I don&acute;t know how to express this any more than to say DAH AH AH DAH DAH AH AH DAH AH!</p><p>This is my first time participating in this group.  I&acute;ve been intimidated up to this point because ya&aacute;ll are so much smarter than I am and some of you are collecting professor&acute;s salaries to do this.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that I&acute;m working on something like this right now for the specific reason that I can&acute;t find it in print.  So I&acute;m writing it myself.  Does anyone out there really believe that Pythagoras couldn&acute;t have figured any of these things out, or even that he did figure it out and never published it.  How about the millions of musicians since Pythagoras, not to mention the contemporaries of Pythagoras.  OK, in the past 2,600 years mankind has produced one writing describing the mathematics of music.</p><p>I have a better citation for you.</p><p><a href="http://chrysalis-foundation.org/Musical_Mathematics_Advance_Orders.htm">http://chrysalis-foundation.org/Musical_Mathematics_Advance_Orders.htm</a></p><p>This guy is selling his book for $90.

I studied economics and law, not music.  So excuse me if my perspective is rather different than any of you.  To me the idea of putting something in print is to make money doing so, not to go begging for charity because the writing has a perceived value to society.  The fact of the matter is that nobody cares.  That is why nothing useful is in print.  Nobody buys it.</p><p>I&acute;ve been desperately searching for something that will aid me in making sense of much of what is discussed in this forum.  I&acute;ve come far enough to know that the use of sine waves is, more or less, useless in the analysis of music.  That is one step in the &quot;process of discarding information - which in turn is the key to discovering its underlying mathematical structure&quot; as quoted above!  With that caviate in mind, where can I find the mathematics of music described in a single educational format?  Or do I just struggle for a number of years and write my own book to make the process infinitely faster for the next guy?</p><p>      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Be a better friend, newshound, and<br/>know-it-all with Yahoo!

Perhaps your know how can help him get his book out. i could use it too despite doing this stuff for 30 years. His work goes into depth into areas have left untouched. The world of acoustic instruments ( for one) awaits this.</p><p>I applaud your attitude toward making the process faster for the next guy.
