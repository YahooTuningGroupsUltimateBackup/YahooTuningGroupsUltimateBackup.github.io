Here the two<br/>chains are at the distance of the diesis, about 55.28 cents.</p><p>Since this discussion has mentioned 12-tET chains, I should add that<br/>24-out-of-36-tET, with two such chains at 1/6-tone (33-1/3 cents)<br/>apart, yields excellent approximations of both the 7-based and<br/>submajor/supraminor thirds.</p><p>What I would like to emphasize especially is that practice has played<br/>a central role in the development and use of these tunings.</p><p>For example, when I first tuned the &quot;e-based&quot; temperament, I did it on<br/>a general kind of intuition, and in actually playing it, came upon the<br/>intervals which I was to describe as &quot;supraminor/submajor&quot; thirds,<br/>evidently choosing these names with a bit of help from Scala&apos;s list<br/>of terms, intnam.par.</p><p>If one hears something new and likes it, of course, then that<br/>experience can become part of one&apos;s &quot;theory,&quot; available for use in<br/>devising or appreciating new scales.</p><p>Again, Kraig, thank you for your contributions here, which often have<br/>an invigorating effect on me.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
