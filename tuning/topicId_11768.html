Quite frankly, the 5ths comes into the equation because I can most easily hear the beatings in 5ths and octaves.  I have much more trouble discerning beatings in 4ths or other intervals - otherwise, I&apos;d love to tune my guitar to all-4ths and be done with it.  Dunno if it is because I&apos;m still very new in my education on just intonation.</p><p>Having just ended a brief flirtation with the cello, for my first guitar tuning experiment I chose the cello tuning for the lowest lowest four strings: C G D A.  Ok, cool, I tune it just like the cello (A tuned to tuner, then tune to just 5ths going down).  However for the upper two strings I ran into a problem because I knew the strings would break before I could tune those to high E and B.  What do I tune those to?  If<br/>I can&apos;t tune them in straight 5ths, then I should tune them to octaves of two of the lower 4 strings.   That way, I still have a just tuning relationship for my open strings.   Cool, so now for my upper two strings, I&apos;ll just pick, out of the choices of C, G, D, and A,  the notes that would yield the smallest possible interval jumps from the A.<br/>The next higher note after A out of that set of 4 turned out to be C.  Cool, so I tuned string 2 until it has zero beating against the lower C.  Now what is the next higher note out of [C G D A] after the C?  It&apos;s the D.  So I tune string 1 to a neat, beatless octave of the lower D.</p><p>Ok, so I played around with it a bit, then I thought, hey this C G D A C D tuning looks awfully familiar.  Well, at least the note names would be, for fans of a certain British guitarist.  I would imagine he and his disciples are using 12-ET and not really using just 5ths.  In the end, I decided not to use it as the high D string for that tuning requires a gauge too thin to work very well with the built-in Sustainer circuit of my guitar.</p><p>I am currently experimenting with D A E D A E (the middle E actually a little higher than the middle D - if tuned to 12 ET, it would be a whole step) and D A D E A E.  I like the former because there is a consistency of all-5ths within the lower 3 and upper 3 string groups but having that middle E higher than the middle D is kind of strange when traversing up the strings.  The latter tuning also has a certain intervallic symmetry of 5ths-4ths-M2-4ths-5ths but it&apos;s not as appealing as the 5ths-5ths-reverseM2-5ths-5ths of the former.</p><p>Paolo<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at <a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div>
