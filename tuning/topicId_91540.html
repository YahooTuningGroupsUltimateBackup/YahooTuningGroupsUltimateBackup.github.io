The beat flows very smoothly and lightly, the<br/>horns are otherworldly, and the hollow-sounding high drums and ambient fluttery<br/>sounds in the background make it even more surreal sounding.  Since everything<br/>shouts &quot;abstract!&quot;...the use of odd tones almost comes across as predictable and<br/>interpretable, &quot;even&quot; for 12TET music lovers, apparently.<br/>  Many listeners called the song things like &quot;comforting&quot;, &quot;scattered samples&quot;,<br/>&quot;night driving&quot;, &quot;the beat pulls the song in and out&quot;...all which seem to allude<br/>to the &quot;predictable abstractness&quot; of the piece.  Especially the part about the<br/>beat pulling the song along (I agree 200% with what Sevish has implied several<br/>times; a smooth beat can really help guide listeners through less-than-normal<br/>tunings and melodies).</p><p>  I&apos;d love to make a guess about the tunings but....Gamma is a HUGE tuning and<br/>adding 19 and 12 EDO along to it mean you can get virtually any chord within a<br/>few cents...and I&apos;m guessing, in that case of &quot;unlimited possibilities&quot; it comes<br/>down to the composers having great ears to choose between the ridiculous amount<br/>of harmonies available.<br/>  I&apos;m not recommending the average musician try something that daunting (which<br/>may cause a sense of hopeless frustration and eventually giving up)...but<br/>agreeing that, in this case, that seems to be exactly what has been done.</p><p>  One thing is for sure: I think there&apos;s HUGE potential for microtonal in<br/>chill-out break-beat music...particularly songs with a 3AM type rave vibe that<br/>shouts &quot;mystery and flow&quot;.</p><p>Awesome work and keep it up!</p></div><h3><a id=91543 href="#91543">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/2010 8:54:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>1/1<br/>       6/5<br/>5/4<br/>       7/5<br/>3/2<br/>       8/5<br/>7/4<br/>       9/5<br/>2/1 (period/octave)</p><p>   This actually gives only one alternative fifth I&apos;d consider bad (a 14/9<br/>between 9/5 and 7/5 on the next octave) and makes for several low-limit<br/>major-ish triads.  I purposefully did not try to force anything the be space<br/>evenly IE around 9/8 to 12/11 as I wanted to open my mind to see what&apos;s possible<br/>when I give up trying to enable new chords using neutral seconds and instead<br/>concentrate on other things.  So what do you think?</p></div>
