My rationale<br/>here was to find the smallest-integer ratio that fit<br/>within a more-or-less &apos;imperceptible&apos; interval of the<br/>pitch-bend that sounded in tune to me.

My rationale<br/>&gt;here was to find the smallest-integer ratio that fit<br/>&gt;within a more-or-less &apos;imperceptible&apos; interval of the<br/>&gt;pitch-bend that sounded in tune to me.  The 23:16 (~628 cents)<br/>&gt;is pretty close to 10:7 (~617 cents), but I hear it as<br/>&gt;distinct from the 10:7 that Johnson uses.  Any other ideas?</p><p>Perhaps it&apos;s closer to a simple JI interval constructed on one of the other ET<br/>pitches on Johnson&apos;s guitar. For example, if Johnson was playing the 900 cent<br/>major sixth on his guitar at this moment, I might consider the vocal pitch to<br/>be a 7:6 below that. Just an example.</p><p>But the important point is not to<br/>confuse pitches with intervals. You should really be saying 23/16 and 10/7<br/>rather than 23:16 and 10:7 since you are referring to pitches and not<br/>intervals. However, it&apos;s the _intervals_ in the music, not the pitches, which<br/>should be analyzed in terms of small-integer ratios. This is a mistake that I<br/>see made all the time, both by supporters and detractors of the idea that simple<br/>ratios have an important role in music. For example, detractors are fond of<br/>pointing out that very few of the chords or scales in use resemble the harmonic<br/>series, while they miss the fact that most chords and scales are constructed of<br/>the _intervals_ found in the very beginning of the harmonic series.</p><p>Ironically, lattice diagrams, particularly the triangular ones, are well suited<br/>to bringing out the _intervallic_ construction of pitch sets. No other<br/>representation allows one to see all the important intervals at a glance. If<br/>one is solely interested in the simplicity of the ratios representing the<br/>_pitches_, one need go no further than to simple write them down (and possibly<br/>perform some operation such as removing all powers of 2).</p></div><h3><a id=5123 href="#5123">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/1999 7:00:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Response to Paul Erlich:</p><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 332.6]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [me, monz]<br/>&gt;&gt; The lattice diagram I&apos;ve just added to my analysis of the<br/>&gt;&gt; rational pitches which I found to be closest to the vocal sung<br/>&gt;&gt; by Robert Johnson on the first verse of _Drunken Hearted Man_:<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/rjohnson/drunken.htm</a><br/>&gt;&gt; can be interpreted as the periodicity-block _gestalt_<br/>&gt;&gt; of rational categorical pitches/intervals analyzed in<br/>&gt;&gt; the tuning of that performance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No offense, Joe, but this practically sounds like you&apos;re<br/>&gt; pulling terms out of your dictionary at random and stringing<br/>&gt; them together.

It&apos;s not about<br/>reducing an infinite number of possible descriptions of a tuning to one<br/>specific one. In fact, Paul Hahn and Graham Breed using Fokker matrices in<br/>connection with ETs indicates that periodicity blocks may also be thought of<br/>in an infinite number of possible descriptions of a tuning.</p><p>Joe, I must credit you for my interest in Fokker periodicity blocks. When<br/>you came over to my house, and we discussed your concept of finity, I<br/>mentioned that the Fokker stuff was the closest thing to what I understood<br/>of your concept. Since then, I&apos;ve learned almost everything I know about<br/>that stuff.</p><p>&gt;(BTW, the only reason I haven&apos;t responded to your postings<br/>&gt;about the Indian sruti system is because I&apos;ve only scanned<br/>&gt;them, and haven&apos;t yet devoted the time to reading them<br/>&gt;properly.  Busy working on the latest draft of my book...<br/>&gt;but this is good stuff that I&apos;d like to include in it.)</p><p>Well, I hope that posting did a good job of answering the question of yours<br/>it was intended to answer.</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
