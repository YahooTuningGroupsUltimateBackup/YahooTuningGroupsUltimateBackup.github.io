Well, certainly I know<br/>&gt; *lots* of composers who use it regularly...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, it seems Sibelius has conquered the interface problem,<br/>&gt; although it&apos;s still not entirely a &quot;piece of cake(walk).&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, it appears, since it&apos;s a reasonably recent program, they&apos;re<br/>&gt; willing to do additional &quot;add-ons&quot; and &quot;plug-ins.&quot;  Now whether they<br/>&gt; will work the way they are &quot;supposed&quot; to do, is another question...<br/>&gt; but maybe with enough &quot;pestering.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who knows, maybe they would even go so far as to have<br/>&gt; entire &quot;microtonal symbols&quot; palette with HEWM??  Or an optional<br/>&gt; &quot;plug in&quot; anyway...</p><p>back in the early 1990s, Lippold Hakken created &quot;LIME&quot;,<br/>the only notation program i know of that from the beginning<br/>was supposed to be able to handle microtonality adequately.</p><p>i never owned LIME myself, and haven&apos;t heard anything about<br/>it for quite a while.  even finding info on it in English<br/>on the web proved difficult ... the only thing i found was<br/>an old Mills tuning list digest with a very negative review<br/>by Brian McLaren and further comments (also mostly negative)<br/>by Paul Rapoport:<br/><a href="http://www.mills.edu/LIFE/CCM/ftp/tuning/list/archive/jun944">http://www.mills.edu/LIFE/CCM/ftp/tuning/list/archive/jun944</a></p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
