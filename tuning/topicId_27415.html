I was<br/>accused of singing off-key, and when I was requested to sing or play<br/>a scale, I attempted to insert additional half-tones which did not<br/>belong. I was repeatedly reprimanded for my failures, and when I<br/>tried to explain to my instructor that I *heard* the additional<br/>tones, she was indignant and sarcastic, suggesting that perhaps I had<br/>a new theory of music to expound. Again and again she would<br/>say, &quot;Listen to this.&quot; She would play the scale over and over, and<br/>then state with emphasis, &quot;There are no other tones to be heard.&quot; As<br/>she played those never-ending scales, I was slowly defeated. I heard<br/>many other tones, and felt, with a kind of sad loyalty, that there<br/>should be a place for them on the piano keyboard.</p></div>
