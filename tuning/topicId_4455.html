It&apos;s a combination of a realtime tracker software<br/>(sequencer+sampler) and a software synthesiszer.  It&apos;s uses plugins called<br/>&quot;machines&quot;, which people can write, and most of the time release for free.<br/>I&apos;ve found that a couple of these machines allow one to adjust the pitch of<br/>individual notes.  Two plugins called M3 and M4 are dual oscillator<br/>softsynths, allowing you to edit the detune of the second oscillator in a<br/>range of -100 to +100 cents.  By turning off the first oscillator, and only<br/>using the second, you can retune individual notes in the sequence.  There are<br/>other Buzz machines that allow you to detune in percentages of -100% to 100%<br/>of a semitone.  It takes a little getting used to, but it&apos;s not hard.  Buzz<br/>machines are generally 12 eq, but since you can load samples, you can adjust<br/>the sampling rate of individual samples, and create scales this way.  Not the<br/>best solution, but it&apos;s free, the output is high quality and fairly easy to<br/>manipulate.  There are numerous effects, most of which are high quality.  Only<br/>problem is it&apos;s only for Windows 9x/direct (I&apos;ve heard rumors it works under<br/>Wine now), it has problems on pre MMX machines (limited number of effects and<br/>synths), and even on regular MMX chips it&apos;s not to hot.  I run it on a PII 266<br/>with 128 megs of RAM and rarely have slowdown, as long as I optimize the<br/>plugin usage a little (on songs with lots of stuff).  RAM is ussually not an<br/>issue if the samples aren&apos;t to large, as I used to run it on my PII with only<br/>16 megs of RAM.  I&apos;ve been using it for 12 eq songs for awhile (since early<br/>alpha stage actuall), and love it.  It takes some work to get alot of body in<br/>your songs, but it&apos;s not impossible, it has some of the most innovative<br/>plugins.  Just thought I&apos;d share that.</p><p>--<br/>Christopher Miller<br/><a href="mailto:vogonpoet@mailandnews.com">vogonpoet@mailandnews.com</a><br/>--</p></div><h3><a id=4456 href="#4456">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Miller &#x3C;vogonpoet@xxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/1999 9:37:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, first off, sorry about the duplicated posts.</p><p>I&apos;ve just figured out a few neat tricks to Microtune a program called Buzz.<br/>In case someone has never heard of it, it&apos;s availabe for free from<br/><a href="http://www.buzz2.com/">http://www.buzz2.com/</a>.
