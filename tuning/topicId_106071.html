If you think it works for you, then great. The standard guitar tuning is kind of meant to be playing chords by strumming most or all of the strings. Chris Vaisvil pointed you to some resources. After looking at the tuning, if you tune your strings down to where the lowest pitch string (top one positionally) stays at E (you don&apos;t tune up) and the higher pitched strings come down respectively, I suspect you will be okay unless the higher pitched strings which are looser start to buzz -- then it is just an annoyance at that point.</p><p>As for finding material to learn by -- I haven&apos;t noticed any, you may need to work things out by hand -- which you can do since you can find the notes.</p><p>Jay</p><p>Quoting v &lt;marshappynation@...&gt;:</p><p>&gt; Hi,<br/>&gt; I am a new member, an experienced pianist now learning the guitar. &gt; After a lot of self-teaching via the Mel Bay type of books, in which &gt; I never got over the chaos in the standard guitar tuning caused by &gt; the inconsisitency in the intervals between strings, I have gone to &gt; major thirds.
