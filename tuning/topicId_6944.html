I&apos;m sure this is at least partly my<br/>fault.  Let me try to clarify.</p><p>I am operating on General MIDI sequences, almost exclusively piano so<br/>far; I can&apos;t yet retune sequences having multiple voices in them.</p><p>I have chosen past works of great composers to experiment with.  I<br/>choose these works NOT because they &quot;need help&quot;; they stand on their own<br/>as pinnacles of achievement in composition.  They don&apos;t need<br/>&quot;improvement&quot;.  They just happen to be available, and they exercise<br/>(and challenge) my methods better than anything else I currently have in<br/>hand.  They are also lovely, retuned or not (IMHO).</p><p>In the long-term, after MANY refinements dreamed-of and not yet<br/>dreamed-of, it is my guess, and my hope, that there will be retunings<br/>truly worthy of the original pieces.  What I have to offer today is but<br/>a bare beginning, and far short of that ideal.  It is absolutely fair<br/>for any member of this list to receive my guess and hope for the future<br/>with complete skepticism.  I ask for no more than to hold the question<br/>open.</p><p>One list member spoke of &quot;one size fits all&quot;.  This seems a bit unjust:<br/>one algorithm, one procedure or set of procedures, &quot;fits all&quot; the<br/>sequences retuned by a given version of the program, but each sequence<br/>retains all the uniqueness of expression it had before retuning, and the<br/>procedure considers and weights all the factors within its sphere of<br/>knowledge which are unique to that sequence.</p><p>The analogy of colorization also was put forth.  In the program&apos;s<br/>present form, this is probably apt and just.  There is a sharp edge<br/>between tunings much like the sharp color edges of colorization, and<br/>the &quot;color&quot; is applied with only imperfect sense.</p><p>The program is primitive enough that any member of this list, given a<br/>sequence and a set of tools to retune it by ear, and given enough time<br/>(a LONG time) could probably do a better job than the program now does.<br/>I have no doubt whatever that some members of this list could do a FAR<br/>better job.</p><p>The retunings, because they factor in only a subset of the<br/>considerations we can easily see to be relevant, stand the chance, and<br/>perhaps the certainty, of upsetting some aspect(s) of artistic balance<br/>present in the original pieces.</p><p>What these tunings DO offer is a preliminary glimpse into what is<br/>possible.  The merest hint, perhaps, accessible only to those with a<br/>fevered (or some other word...) imagination.</p><p>Yet, even in this terribly primitive state, there might be an<br/>interesting new light cast upon some moments of familiar music.  Or,<br/>failing that, some understanding of a better way to proceed.  At the<br/>very least, these would be an object lesson in pitfall(s) to avoid.</p><p>JdL</p><p><a href="http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/">http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/</a></p></div>
