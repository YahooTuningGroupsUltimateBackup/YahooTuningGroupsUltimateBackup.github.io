This would meet your goal of under $1000 cost<br/>assuming you have a system in the 200 MHz plus range.</p><p>If you must have a standalone unit then the newer Emu modules offer<br/>excellent filtering and processing of the wavetable samples, as well as good<br/>lower level programming of envelopes, LFOs, etc, and 12 full keyboard tuning<br/>tables.</p><p>There isn&apos;t much on the used market I would recommend for synthesis.  Yamaha<br/>FM synthesis is fairly limited in the breadth of what it can do, and their<br/>newest version of it, the FS1R, did not have tuning tables.</p><p>I am building an analog modular.  It is a very expensive route to take, and<br/>I plan to use it as an addition to more polyphonic capable digital<br/>synthesis.</p><p>Visit my web site for more information and links to the above programs and<br/>instruments.</p><p>John Loffink<br/><a href="mailto:microtonal@worldnet.att.net">microtonal@worldnet.att.net</a><br/>The Microtonal Synthesis Web Site<br/><a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal">http://home.att.net/~microtonal</a></p><p>&gt; Subject: Looking to buy a synthesizer<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Good day to everyone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   I am a microtonal composer looking for a synthesizer, and I can<br/>&gt; think of no better place to ask for reccomendations than here.  My<br/>&gt; budget is such that the instrument has to be under $1000 (used is<br/>&gt; fine), in fact the cheaper the better. I&apos;m not really interested in<br/>&gt; sampling-based keyboards;  I love doing extensive sound design.  It<br/>&gt; would be neccessary for me to be able to program any tunings I want,<br/>&gt; and move among them flexibly... I don&apos;t need an arpeggiatior,<br/>&gt; sequencer, dsp, etc. - if the price is right I don&apos;t even mind<br/>&gt; something from 1982 or something without midi.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Perhaps I should even consider building an analog modular synth<br/>&gt; myself - any success stories out there?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Later,<br/>&gt;           Crow<br/>&gt;</p></div>
