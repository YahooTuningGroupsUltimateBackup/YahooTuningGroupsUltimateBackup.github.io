On 11/24/99, Ken Wauchope wrote,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; [extended quote...]</p><p>&gt;&gt; [John deLaubenfels, TD 499.9]<br/>&gt;&gt; Well, I DID see those posts, but I don&apos;t find the phrase<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;septimal augmented sixth&quot; in them; thus my question.</p><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 499.18]<br/>&gt; The Bb7 and Eb7 that Ken refers to are not really dominant<br/>&gt; seventh chords; since his tuning includes C# and G# but not<br/>&gt; Db or Ab, these are actually augmented sixth chords. They<br/>&gt; are &quot;septimal&quot; since, as Ken points out, they very closely<br/>&gt; approximate 4:5:6:7.</p><p>Paul is very careful in his last response here to put<br/>quotation marks around &apos;septimal&apos; (they did not appear<br/>in his original description) and to note that this meantone<br/>chord *approximates* 4:5:6:7.  I&apos;m glad that he added those<br/>two things, and I think that there&apos;s a very important point<br/>hidden in here that deserves further elaboration.</p><p>First off, the &apos;augmented 6th&apos; under consideration actually<br/>has a more specific name in regular music-theory, actually two,<br/>which appear in 4-part harmony as follows:</p><p>- &apos;Italian 6th&apos;, which is a IV 6+<br/>i.e., first inversion of the subdominant chord where<br/>the &apos;3rd&apos;, which is in the bass, is flattened by a 1/2-step,<br/>the &apos;root&apos; (in an upper voice) is sharpened by a 1/2-step,<br/>and the &apos;5th&apos; is doubled.</p><p>- &apos;German 6th&apos;, which is a IV 6+ 5 3<br/>i.e., the same as above except that instead of doubling<br/>the &apos;5th&apos;, one voice has the &apos;5th&apos; and the other the &apos;7th&apos;<br/>flattened by a 1/2-step.</p><p>In 12-EDO, both of these have the same interval structure<br/>as the &apos;dominant 7th&apos;; the &apos;Italian 6th&apos; lacks what would<br/>be the &apos;5th&apos; in the &apos;dominant 7th&apos; chord, and the &apos;German 6th&apos;<br/>contains it.</p><p>The point of this is that I think we should be careful<br/>to refer to the distinction between the two in tuning<br/>theory when it is relevant to the structure of the chords,<br/>altho I suppose &apos;augmented 6th&apos; is good enough in most cases.</p><p>Note that there are also two other &apos;augmented 6th&apos; chords:</p><p>- the &apos;French 6th&apos;, which is II 6+ 4 3<br/>i.e., the same as the &apos;German&apos; exceptthat the &apos;flat (or minor)<br/>7th&apos; is lowered a further 1/2-step to a &apos;6th&apos;, which would be<br/>a &apos;flat 5th&apos; in the &apos;dominant 7th&apos; interpretation.</p><p>- one without a specific name, which is +II 6+ 4++ 3<br/>i.e., the same as the &apos;German&apos;, but spelled as a sharpened<br/>&apos;6th&apos; rather than a flattened &apos;7th&apos;.</p><p>(see _The New Harvard Dictionary of Music_, p 752)</p><p>The qualifier which Paul put in quotations refers to the<br/>prime-limit of the chord or interval.  The ones in common<br/>use are:</p><p>prime  Latin numeral<br/>limit   name</p><p>  3   Pythagorean<br/>  5   just<br/>  7   septimal<br/> 11   undecimal<br/> 13   tridecimal<br/> 17   septadecimal<br/> 19   nondecimal</p><p>They can be extended in the same way with the Latin<br/>numerals for higher primes.</p><p>I think that we should distinguish clearly between<br/>those chords/intervals that *are* septimal, undecimal, etc.,<br/>and those that *imply* septimal, undecimal, etc.</p><p>The proportions 4:5:6:7 by definition describe a &apos;harmonic 7th&apos;<br/>chord, a tetrad (= 4 notes) to be exact.</p><p>The meantone &apos;augmented 6th&apos; chord sounds very much like<br/>4:5:6:7, but it has proportions which include irrational<br/>ones and which would look far different from this.  So it<br/>should be called an &apos;implied harmonic 7th&apos; or &apos;implied<br/>septimal dominant 7th&apos; chord.</p><p>I suppose that &apos;implied septimal augmented 6th&apos; would<br/>convey well the information that Paul was transmitting,<br/>but I find it somewhat less than adequate because the<br/>meantone &apos;augmented 6th&apos; has its basis in the 5-limit<br/>&apos;just augmented 6th&apos;, which likewise also sounds very<br/>much like the &apos;septimal harmonic 7th&apos;, but whose ratios<br/>only imply but do not contain 7.</p><p>In fact, the 5-limit &apos;augmented 6th&apos; is a good example<br/>of a chord that contains a ratio that may be analyzed as<br/>&apos;extended reference&apos;.  For example, the &apos;German 6th&apos; is<br/>(&apos;octave&apos;-specific notation):</p><p>                    45/32<br/>                     F#<br/>                     /<br/>                    /<br/>   1/1---(3/2)---(9/8)<br/>    C    ( G )   ( D )<br/>   / \<br/>  /   \<br/>4/5---6/5<br/> Ab    Eb</p><p>The interval between 4/5 and 45/32 is:<br/>  (45/32) / (4/5)<br/>= (45/32) * (5/4)<br/>= 225/128<br/>= ~976.54 cents</p><p>This is very close to the 7/4 [= 968.83 cents], and this,<br/>coupled with the 4:5:6 proportion of the other three notes,<br/>gives it a strong resemblance to 4:5:6:7.</p><p>But analyzed as extended reference, the 45/32 is actually<br/>the 4:5 &apos;major 3rd&apos; above 9/8.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.

The pitches sounding look like a 1/2-diminished<br/>7th chord, but it doesn&apos;t resolve that way; it resolves like an<br/>augmented 6th chord.  One could consider it a variant of the French 6th,<br/>with a minor 3rd above the bass instead of major.</p><p>--pH &lt;<a href="mailto:manynote@library.wustl.edu">manynote@library.wustl.edu</a>&gt; <a href="http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote">http://library.wustl.edu/~manynote</a><br/>    O<br/>   /\        &quot;Churchill?
