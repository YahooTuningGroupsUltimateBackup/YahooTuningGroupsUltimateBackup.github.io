They&apos;re the same choices you<br/>get when you build a chromatic system starting with</p><p>1/1 - 9/8 - 5/4 - 4/3 - 3/2 - 5/3 - 15/8</p><p>A meantone conflates 9/8 with 10/9 and 5/3 with 27/16 etc,<br/>which is all very well for playing the real music that some<br/>theorists thought the JI scale was used for. But if you DO want<br/>5-limit JI, and feel like embedding it in an EDO, then 53 has<br/>popped up as a choice becuase it is extremely (indistinguishably)<br/>accurate.</p><p>Bob (bval since I&apos;m sometimes confused with BobW) Valentine</p></div>
