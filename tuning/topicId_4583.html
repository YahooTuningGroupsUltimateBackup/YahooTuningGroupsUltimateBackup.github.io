He gave them names like the &quot;boo,&quot; the<br/>&quot;bloboy&quot; and the &quot;spoils of war.&quot; (The &quot;cloud chamber bowls&quot; are<br/>bell-like gongs made of 12-gallon Pyrex containers once used for<br/>sub-atomic particle experiments.) The heaviest Partch piece, a<br/>marimba the size of a piano, weighs 600 pounds.</p><p>They&apos;re not the sort of instruments you can keep in the living room, or<br/>even the garage. So storage has been something of a problem for<br/>Drummond, a one-time prot&#xFFFD;g&#xFFFD; of the late composer.</p><p>But for now, at least, Partch&apos;s instruments, have found a home at<br/>Montclair State University, where they occupy 2,000 square feet of<br/>the music department building.</p><p>&quot;We feel Harry Partch was one of the most important figures of<br/>20th-century American music,&quot; says David Witten, a music professor<br/>at the school. &quot;And it&apos;s pretty apparent that the instruments are as<br/>interesting to look at as they are to hear.&quot;</p><p>That wasn&apos;t a popular opinion when Partch was alive. Until recently he<br/>was regarded mainly as an outsider in the world of music theory.<br/>And, although his reputation has grown since his death in 1974, his<br/>songs -- which sound like Martian chamber music -- still upset<br/>people, according to Drummond, whose group, Newband, will give a<br/>Sept. 12 concert of Partch&apos;s music at Montclair State.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s like being the first person to say the Earth is round,&quot; says<br/>Drummond, who lives in Nyack, N.Y. &quot; &apos;Your world is limited&apos; -- that&apos;s<br/>what his message was. He just wanted to open up the world of<br/>possibilities. And he did.&quot;</p><p>Partch, a classically trained musician who started composing in the<br/>early 1930s, thought the 12-note Western scale wasn&apos;t enough to<br/>convey the full range of expression found in the human voice,<br/>according to Drummond. So he devised something called a<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot; scale, the keys of which are labeled with fractions, like<br/>8/5 and 4/3, instead of letters, like C, G and E.</p><p>You can&apos;t play &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; on a Partch instrument. Or,<br/>more accurately, you can play part of it, but as Drummond points out,<br/>&quot;It will sound out of tune.&quot;</p><p>Partch&apos;s own melodies can sound out of tune, too, while his song<br/>titles read like lines of surrealist poetry. &quot;And on the Seventh Day,<br/>Petals Fell in Petaluma,&quot; is one, while a piece Drummond is currently<br/>rehearsing is called &quot;San Francisco: A Setting of the Cries of Two<br/>Newsboys on a Foggy Night in the Twenties.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&apos;s from his hobo opera, &apos;The Wayward,&apos;&quot; says Drummond.</p><p>Another song, titled &quot;I&apos;m very happy to be telling you about this . .<br/>.,&quot; is<br/>the transcription of a glider pilot&apos;s broadcast set to music. Other<br/>Partch pieces feature literary passages by Shakespeare, Lewis<br/>Carroll, James Joyce and the Chinese poet Li Po.</p><p>Drummond, 50, was a California high school student learning to play<br/>the trumpet when he met Partch. He was enthralled with the<br/>iconoclastic composer, who, with his flowery clothes and sandals,<br/>dressed like &quot;the hippest of hippies.&quot; Partch rehearsed his music in<br/>an old Laundromat and taught Drummond to play a harpsichord-like<br/>instrument called the &quot;harmonic canon.&quot;</p><p>Drummond has been playing his music ever since.</p><p>&quot;It turned out to be an all-consuming thing for me,&quot; he says.</p><p>Today, Drummond is one of about 20 people in the world who can<br/>play Partch&apos;s instruments. Except for Newband, his nine-member<br/>group -- which is now the ensemble-in-residence at Montclair State --<br/>barely anyone else can perform Partch&apos;s music live.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re the only ones who have the instruments,&quot; says Drummond&apos;s<br/>wife, Stefani Starin, co-director of Newband and a flutist with the<br/>group. &quot;They can&apos;t be played on anything else except a synthesizer.&quot;</p><p>They can, however, be played on a &quot;zoomoozophone,&quot; a massive<br/>aluminum xylophone invented by Drummond, whose own music has<br/>the same absurdist bent as Partch&apos;s.</p><p>At the Montclair show, Drummond will be playing his song<br/>&quot;Congressional Record,&quot; which features sung snippets of the<br/>Kenneth Starr Report. It ends with the &quot;Plumbing Standards<br/>Improvement Act of 1999,&quot; a verbatim congressional transcript, in<br/>which an irate senator thunders, &quot;The message is clear, and often<br/>written on toilet paper: &apos;Get the government out of my bathroom!&apos; &quot;</p><p>As Starin readily admits, &quot;We have no commercial appeal.&quot;</p><p>But she and Drummond are dedicated to bringing Partch&apos;s music to<br/>the world -- which isn&apos;t cheap. Trucking the instruments to an<br/>upcoming gig in California will cost more than $13,000, and when<br/>Newband toured Europe, shipping expenses helped drive the band&apos;s<br/>price to $80,000.</p><p>Anyone who invites Newband to play must often raise funds to pay for<br/>it, says Drummond. Needless to say, the group doesn&apos;t make much<br/>money from the shows. Yet, somehow, Drummond has always<br/>managed to find space for the instruments, which have had five<br/>different storage places since he inherited them in 1990.</p><p>Their last home was at the State University of New York in Purchase,<br/>where Drummond was the artist in residence. But when a new music<br/>school dean arrived, he was sent packing again.</p><p>Drummond and Starin dream of someday founding a Partch<br/>museum, maybe in Montclair, where the original instruments can be<br/>exhibited and Newband can be free to tour with duplicates.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to ever move them again,&quot; says Drummond. &quot;Harry&apos;s<br/>whole life was like that. He knew very well what the burden was. Now,<br/>I know, too.&quot;</p><p>Newband will perform the works of Harry Partch on Sept. 12 at<br/>Montclair State University in the Recital Hall of McEachern Music<br/>Building. The concert, which begins at 8 p.m., is free and open to the<br/>public, but donations are welcome. The proceeds will benefit the<br/>music department.</p></div>
