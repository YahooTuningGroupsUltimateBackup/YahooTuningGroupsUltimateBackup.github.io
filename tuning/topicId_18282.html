Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2001 11:08:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Folks,</p><p>There are many issues at stake when a group such as this utilizes a &apos;free&apos;, yet commerce-based, service to run a mailing list. While Yahoo&apos;s TOS (Terms Of Service) might work at this point, and not infringe or endanger anyone in terms of either copyright or license, there is nothing whatsoever to keep that from happening in the future. Amazon changed their privacy policy in mid-stream, and caused not individuals but even publishers (who were privacy-minded) to rethink their participation.</p><p>There are already signs that behind-the-scenes actions have caused some changes (such as certain formats of email, possibly .html formatted, not coming though in the digests). How and why Yahoo will configure their mailing list software is entirely up to them -- which means that no one in this group has any control; this goes for their other policies as well.</p><p>They could just as easily say &quot;Well, all your email addresses are our property, and as an asset we can sell them as we can any of our property.&quot; (Which is exactly what happened at <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>) And then they could sell them to businesses to use for UCE and spam, and your inbox would clog with even more pager and Viagra adverts. Not likely? Hmmm...how about the fact that Yahoo!, long revered as a search engine, is now placing URLs in higher ranking if they have *paid* Yahoo! to do so -- thereby meaning that while your site may have more information, or have been on the web longer, you better pay up or the search engine isn&apos;t going to guide readers to your site.</p><p>Gone are the days of the free lunch, folks.</p><p>As to whether this esteemed list could survive a move, any complaints that it is dead-set where it is are truly short-sighted: the list has had at least two homes, and a few of us are still here from the old Mills College days. We didn&apos;t get lost and we didn&apos;t have any trouble. Links are made to be changed, because the web ain&apos;t carved in stone! I&apos;d hate to see it move, because it&apos;s a lot of work, but I for one won&apos;t let comfort cloud my judgement.</p><p>Final thought? Just bear in mind that your comfy home won&apos;t necessarily be that way forever, because *you* don&apos;t control it -- someone else does. Which is why I always value email lists that are run by an individual (or individuals) on their own resources that everyone can trust. And having been a member of various lists for nearly a decade, I&apos;ve seen enough implosions to know that this is **not** paranoia, but simply prudent pragmatism.</p><p>OK, back to composing for me. Where the hell is that calculator...   :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div><h3><a id=18285 href="#18285">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/3/2001 11:25:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.

I was specifically talking about &quot;surviving a move&quot; -- I<br/>agree that not having the Mills College archive is not swell. That<br/>said, if Yahoo says &apos;buh-bye&apos; to newsgroups, the same thing will<br/>happen!
