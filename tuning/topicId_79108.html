I remember myself having said the other day that I didn&apos;t like using intervals less than about 60 cents as melodic steps as I found them rather &quot;unnatural&quot;, for one thing, and, for another thing, not easy to sing or to play on an non-fixed-pitch instrument (particularly a sequence of more like these played right one after another sounds pretty &quot;harsh&quot; to my ear sometimes). Then, a few months later, I found yet another point to this topic. And today, this was &quot;reconfirmed&quot; to me in such a strong way that I just think it deserves being shared.<br/>I didn&apos;t manage to follow your &quot;con/dissonance&quot; discussion very carefully but I think this might be one of many possible examples where larger intervals can serve better than smaller ones.<br/>This afternoon, I was improvising some sort of variations on an old Baroque &quot;ciacona&quot; (hope I can call it like that) in a tuning close to meantone (only some fifths were slightly wider or narrower than others). None of the voices used any step between consecutive tones which would be smaller than about 115 cents or so. I ran it through a very strong reverb effect and the triads started blending nicely. Just for an experiment, I then took a part of my earlier semisixth piece, ran it through the same reverb, and what happened was exactly what I expected would happen. Whenever any of the voices went up or down by the ~56 cent step (which is the distance of 3 octaves minus 8 &quot;semi-sixths&quot;), the difference tones between the overlapping pitches got so slow that I could actually hear beating in some places.<br/>For conclusion, here&apos;s what semisixth in reverb sounds like:<br/><a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/o8hv0u">www.sendspace.com/file/o8hv0u</a></p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=79110 href="#79110">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2008 10:17:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well I for one love small intervals.

In a structure such as the eikosany  one adds pitches to complete a constant structure, some can be as small as 4.5 cents. In that context in using the scale where each note has a unique role, i would be at a lost if it wasn&apos;t there. but possibly this still means that i might be hearing a tone  that fluctuates between two values. like a double star, or something with a unique &apos;life&apos;.<br/>I think Carl is touching upon the same type of phenomenon, that sometimes we need notes that moves.

A falling octave, on the other hand, can be written either as a linear factor of 1/2 or as a size of -1200 cents. Similarly, the linear factor for my version of the &quot;semisixth&quot; interval is the 16th root of 60, which you can convert to cents either by converting this value in exactly the same way as I&apos;ve described, or by converting 60 to cents and then dividing the result by 16. Whatever way you do it, you&apos;ll end up with ~443.01679 cents. -- If you are also interested in why I chose this particular value, you can ask me as well -- it has a lot to do with approximating 5-limit intervals.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=79123 href="#79123">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/2008 8:48:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #ddd'><b>Attachments</b></div><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael Sheiman wrote:</p><p>      &gt; I have read about this and found it works in practice:<br/>      &gt; it&apos;s as if something very close to a note is read in the mind as &quot;the same note&quot;<br/>      &gt; while something kind of close makes the brain stumble asking the question<br/>      &gt; &quot;is this the same note or not?&quot; thus making that note sound un-natural.</p><p>      Couldn&apos;t say it better.</p><p>      Petr</p></div><h3><a id=79124 href="#79124">ðŸ”—</a>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/2008 8:46:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Petr, this is a delight to hear !<br/>It reminds me in the beginning of a harmonic flute (10-11-12 harmonics, with<br/>that similar &quot;pushed 11th harmonic&quot; effect).<br/>But such a simple and wonderful system -<br/>That apparently lets you have very close to JI fifths and major thirds.<br/>And a very present, but interesting I think, 31/24 approximation.<br/>My calculator is out of service but I presume it&apos;s close.</p><p>May I add that this generator is giving you almost perfectly coherent<br/>difference tones, as it shows in this JI-approximated series :<br/>56 72 93 120...<br/>where 93 - 72 = 21 (8/3 of 56) and 120 - 93 = 27 (8/3 of 72)</p><p>I would think it adds to the musicality of the shifts where you use it.</p><p>- - - -<br/>Jacques</p><p>le 9/11/08 11:36, Petr Par&#x9D;&iacute;zek &agrave; p.parizek@... a &eacute;crit&nbsp;:</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s a 16-tone chain of, let&apos;s say, &quot;extremely large major thirds&quot;.
