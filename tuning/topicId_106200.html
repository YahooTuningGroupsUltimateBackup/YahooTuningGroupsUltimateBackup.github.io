For an EDO, enter &quot;set nota N&quot; in the command line, where N is the division number of the EDO; for an EDO that&apos;s a multiple of 12, enter &quot;set nota sa12r&quot; to use the trojan symbol set.  For JI, enter &quot;set nota saji1&quot; (for medium precision), &quot;set nota saji2&quot; (for high precision, no accents), &quot;set nota saji3&quot; (for high precision, with accents), or &quot;set nota saji4&quot; (for extreme precision).  (Dave &amp; I are in the process of changing the extreme-precision notation: &quot;accents&quot; will be called &quot;diacritics&quot;, to avoid confusing them with symbols representing accent marks used for musical expression; in extreme precision, right-accents are being replaced with new 1- and 2-mina diacritics placed to the left of a Sagittal accidental.)</p><p>Next you&apos;ll need to get the tuning into memory.  If the tuning is in a .scl file, then load it into Scala.  For an EDO, enter &quot;equal N&quot; in the command line, where N is the division number of the EDO.  (Although not all EDOs are currently supported, new ones may be added by editing the sag_et.par file in the Scala22 folder.)  For JI ratios not in a file, enter &quot;clear&quot; in the command line before continuing.</p><p>Click on the Edit icon to view the scale currently in memory.  If you entered &quot;clear&quot;, you cleared the pitches from memory (except 1/1), which will allow you to enter pitches one at a time on the &quot;New Pitch&quot; line (if required, click on the Ascending box to sort them in order of pitch).  Most pitches are notated two different ways, using different nominals.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=106204 href="#106204">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/1/2013 10:23:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;bigAndrewM&quot; &lt;bigandrewm@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, by the way, in the chart on this page: <a href="http://sagittal.org/SagittalJI.gif">http://sagittal.org/SagittalJI.gif</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the 25C accidental, ,!/ is listed as 2048/2045.

I&apos;ve been thinking about changing that to an official 13-limit low-precision Spartan JI that uses the entire Spartan symbol set:<br/>|(  /|  |)  //|  /|)  /|\  (|)  (|\  )||(  ||)  ||\  /||)  /||\</p><p>Note:  |\ and /|| were originally in the Spartan set, but after Dave &amp; I decided to include //| and )||( (for extended 5-limit JI and 53-EDO), we recently decided that these should replace |\ and /||, which we demoted to the Athenian level.  (The Sagittal paper needs to be updated to reflect this change.)</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=106205 href="#106205">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/1/2013 10:53:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; ...
