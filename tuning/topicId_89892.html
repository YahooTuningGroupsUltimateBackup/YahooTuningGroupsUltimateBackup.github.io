I call it &quot;Mother&quot;, because it&apos;s the inverse MOS of Father--Mother here is ssLssLsL, Father is LLsLLsLs.  Sort of like how Mavila is the inverse of the Diatonic scale--ssLsssL instead of LLsLLLs.  Mother as an MOS appears in any EDO with a &quot;supermajor&quot; third between 1\3 (400&cent;) and 3\8 (450&cent;); it appears to reach its peak harmonic usefulness with a generator in the middle of that spectrum, around a 23/18.  So it comes up with very similar properties in 17-EDO, as well as 14-EDO and (to an extent) 19-EDO and 20-EDO.

Pentatonic has a high reward-per-effort ratio for those just starting music: in a good few cases even someone both completely untrained in theory and unpracticed at &quot;playing by ear&quot; can make intelligent and &quot;well calculated&quot; sounding chords with it....because of how all the dyads &quot;wrap around each other&quot; so well and produce almost all concordant intervals.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real challenge to me, is getting something with more flexibility IE with 7+ tones to have that sort of &quot;pentatonic stability&quot;.&nbsp; The scale you pointed out certainly sounds fool-proof, but composing in it just makes me feel emotionally chained far as expression due to the &quot;missing 2 notes&quot;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2010 9:47:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;And the last on this tonight<br/>Squares 8 on piano via gr-20 (as the rest of the improvisations were)<br/><a href="http://notonlymusic">http://notonlymusic</a> .com/board/ download/ file.php? id=381&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Has a very odd effect...seems to hover somewhat predictably at a fair level of dissonance, never really dipping into very high dissonance, but not quite backing out to a level of resolve often either.&nbsp; It&apos;s very jazzy (both the scale and the song) and has an in-between resolved tone wail to it where I sense characteristics of &quot;two interval classes at once&quot; in many parts.&nbsp; The part of the song from 1:45-2:20 I find particularly amusing, jumping between chords that seem to fit most clearly into different tonal classes rather than feeling &quot;in between&quot; and have a fluttery yet chilling feel to the mood.&nbsp; Sound like you are playing Jingle Bells in one part<br/> around there, though (lol). :-D</p></div><h3>Jacques Dudon &#x3C;fotosonix@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/2010 3:15:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris wrote :</p><p>&gt; I think I just found a tuning that does all Michael S. could hope<br/>&gt; for.
