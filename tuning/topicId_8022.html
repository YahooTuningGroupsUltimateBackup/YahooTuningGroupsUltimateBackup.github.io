Chapman, TD 499.7:]<br/>&gt;This may sound silly,</p><p>The sillier the better; fire away!</p><p>&gt;but would it help to have the equivalent of a set of &quot;open strings&quot;?<br/>&gt;For example: on my violin the open strings are (usually): G D A E.  I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t have to play the strings open at all, but I can play them<br/>&gt;occasionally to make sure that my fingerings haven&apos;t drifted too far.<br/>&gt;Maybe you can chose a small set of grounded pitches that are the<br/>&gt;equivalent, rather than grounding all of them or only one of them.</p><p>An interesting idea!  Might be a good compromise between grounding all<br/>notes and grounding one note.  Observe that the four notes, separated by<br/>fifths, already form a tuning conflict; one can play &quot;comma pump in G&quot;<br/>with the sequence G,E,A,D,G.  But of course, in grounding all 12 notes,<br/>I have inevitably introduced even more conflict between tuning and<br/>grounding, though I&apos;m still not sure that won&apos;t wind up being the best<br/>method, at least for some pieces.</p><p>Thanks, Christopher, for your suggestions!</p><p>[Joe Monzo, TD 499.3:]<br/>&gt;Hey John, can you make a version of this arrangement using 36-EDO?<br/>&gt;Now *that* would be really interesting.</p><p>Joe is referring to the Bach/Busoni Chaconne.  Joe, I&apos;m afraid my<br/>software is not able to make any kind of EDO output at present.  And of<br/>the universe of EDO&apos;s, 36 certainly seems an odd choice for Busoni to<br/>have made: you get the usual horrible 4:5 of 400 cents that we&apos;ve all<br/>heard since birth, or you can squeeze back to 366.7 cents, 20 cents too<br/>FLAT!  Poo!!</p><p>[Joe Monzo, TD 499.4:]<br/>&gt;Interesting how our definitions of &apos;pump&apos; and &apos;flat&apos; mix metaphors<br/>&gt;here: Carl&apos;s JI technique causes &apos;pump&apos; to have exactly the opposite<br/>&gt;meaning originally intended by John when he coined it.</p><p>Yes and no: the air-mattress pump Jude &amp; I use for camping DOES allow<br/>pumping in either direction.  And, as Carl points out, one can play the<br/>pump backward and drive tuning sharp rather than flat.</p><p>[Carl Lumma, TD 500.4:]<br/>&gt;Let me turn you on to Erv Wilson&apos;s pitch-space diagrams (if you&apos;re not<br/>&gt;already hip).  Go to...<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal12.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal12.html</a></p><p>Thanks, Carl, I will!</p><p>If I have failed to respond to anyone&apos;s questions or comments, please<br/>remind me on or off list.  Thanks again to everyone!!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
