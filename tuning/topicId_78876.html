Here&apos;s one<br/>way to introduce one&apos;s self on a mailing list:</p><p>&quot;Hi, my name is Joseph Bernard (&lt;-- your real name goes here).<br/>I&apos;m interested in quantifying consonance. I found this<br/>group by recommendation  (how you found us) and thought<br/>maybe people here might be interested in theories of<br/>consonance too. Here&apos;s a spreadsheet showing my work:</p><p><a href="http://www.xxxxxxxx">http://www.xxxxxxxx</a> .com/myspreadshe et.xls<br/>You&apos;re just going to have to download files from my group.<br/>Here&apos;s how to read it: The x-axis is time and there is no y axis.<br/>etc.  There are hundreds of pages of spread sheets.</p><p>What do people think?</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>bjosephmex&quot;</p><p>Here&apos;s how you introduced yourself:</p><p>&quot;Hi, I&apos;ve developed a theory of consonance that is<br/>completely unique in all the world, while, mysteriously<br/>being a reinvention of the wheel at the same time. I&apos;ve<br/>gone ahead and created a members-only mailing list devoted<br/>to my theories, for the benefit of the throngs of people<br/>who have demonstrated interest in it. So come over and<br/>check it out -- I&apos;m not interested in contributing here.&quot;</p><p>See the difference?</p><p>-Carl<br/>Granted that you think there are 1000 posts here that impliedly<br/>describe consonance better than something that you have not read I&apos;m<br/>not going to ask you to challenge my theories further.  It would seem<br/>that my material would be a better starting point than going back and<br/>forth with you over the 1000 posts.<br/>Actually, I think I said that I wanted to keep the discussion all in<br/>one place rather than use this group, then I relented and said I<br/>would just cut and paste since my group was flying like a lead<br/>balloon.<br/>Don&apos;t get angry at the prospect that I thought of the &quot;coefficient of<br/>consonance&quot; before you did, and don&apos;t hate me because I&apos;m beautiful.<br/>Here&apos;s a picture of me:<br/><a href="http://body.builder.hu/imagebank/pictures/982089582.jpg">http://body.builder.hu/imagebank/pictures/982089582.jpg</a><br/>Caleb writes<br/>Ok, now I&apos;ll shut up.<br/>I write:  How come I get pocket pool and everyone else gets &quot;OK, now<br/>I&apos;ll shut up.&quot;<br/>Sigh!  Maybe I&apos;ll just join abortion blogs and see what I can do with<br/>opposing points of view there.<br/>2 to the power of 11 is 2048.  I&apos;m guessing that the octave is number<br/>12?</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/31/2008 10:47:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;bjosephmex&quot; &lt;bjosephmex@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tell you I haven&apos;t had this much trouble since I joined the<br/>&gt; Palistinian and Isreali blogs<br/>&gt; Thanks for the link Carl<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups">http://groups</a>. <a href="http://yahoo.com/">yahoo.com/</a> group/Coefficien tOfConsonance<br/>&gt; But there is one piece of disinformation in your post.
