It&apos;s the old version, the really old<br/>version, that runs of 68XXX Macs. It runs fine on my<br/>Powerbook 180.<br/>   &quot;Fine&quot; means it works the way it&apos;s supposed to. MAX<br/>is a disaster as music software for many reasons. The<br/>way it&apos;s supposed to work violently contradicts most<br/>of the ways a reasonable composer&apos;s mind works, both<br/>in my experience and in that of many other MAX users.<br/>   Let&apos;s start at the beginning:<br/>   MAX is badly misconceived at its most basic level.<br/>   The idea of making music by wiring together various<br/>virtual modules is a disaastrous for several reason. First,<br/>because of the patch-cord jungle effect. In a typical MAX<br/>patch you quickly gets virtual wires going from everywhere<br/>to everywhere else to the point where it becomes impossible<br/>to figure what the bloody hell is going on. Cause and effect<br/>rapidly becomes lost. A flow chart become impossible to<br/>visual. The whole thing makes your head ache. It makes<br/>your teeth hurt. Your eyes pulsate like jellied napalm<br/>just looking at the whole criss-crossing spiderweb mess.<br/>    So you encapsulate that spiderweb mess in another<br/>virtual container.  Then  you string virtual wires from<br/>that virtual block to another virtual block. Soon the<br/>same problem begins anew.<br/>    At the end of the day, you wind up with a set of neat<br/>little virtual blocks which, when clicked upon to expand &apos;em,<br/>turn into a Spaghetti From Hell. Not my idea of a good way<br/>to visual a musical score. Nor (I would submit) any other<br/>competent musician&apos;s.<br/>    The second problem is related, but slightly different. It<br/>is the same problem suffered by Csound and MusicBox and<br/>other similar computer composition/timbral specification<br/>langauges or systems. (MAX is a graphical language of sorts.)<br/>     This problem involves bogging down in the minutia.<br/>     There is no way, to my knowledge, in MAX to do something<br/>as simple as stop at rehearsal mark C and go back and pick up<br/>from rehearsal mark B. Real musicians in the real world are<br/>accustomed to doing this. MAX works at a micro-level, the ultra-<br/>low level, the infra-atomic level of music.<br/>     To prove useful, real musical tools developed over the centuries<br/>(like common practice musical scores) gracefully accomodate a full<br/>range of musical hierarchies. As L. B.l Meyer has pointed out, music<br/>is a hierarchical procedure in which the rules differ drastically<br/>from one level of the hierarchy to another.<br/>     Let us take some specific concrete examples of MAX&apos;s gross<br/>inadequacy -- which is to say, MAX&apos;s obsessive monomaniacal concern<br/>ONLY with the infra-atomic micro-level of music.<br/>     Suppose you want to compose by doing what Lou Harrison sometimes<br/>does -- namely, sketch out some high points and then draw an arc in<br/>between those melodic points. MAX has no way of doing anything like<br/>this.  MAX has no way of shaping a phrase &quot;ritardando,&quot; or spceifying<br/>very strong-off-beat accents within one phrase as opposed to strong<br/>on-the-beat accents within the next phrase.<br/>     MAX has none of these features because MAX concerns itself only<br/>with things like &quot;bangs&quot; and &quot;triggers.&quot; These are infra-atomic<br/>musical levels of actions in which individual notes get stopped or<br/>started, or blcoks of notes get stopped or started.<br/>     This misconceived anti-musical mindset, built into MAX at the<br/>basic level, typically results in a standard &quot;sound&quot; in MAX MIDI<br/>compositions. (There&apos;s a MAX DSP add-on but I won&apos;t speak to that<br/>since I don&apos;t own it and haven&apos;t used it.)<br/>     A typical MAX composition is like the end of that kid&apos;s<br/>game &quot;Mousetrap.&quot; You take some action on a MIDI kbd or MIDI woodwind<br/>controller or some other MIDI generator, and MAX spews out a rapid<br/>blast of unpredictable notes. Then the MAX output settles down, then<br/>another blast of stuff vomits out of MAX. This goes on and on until<br/>the MAX program reaches its end or until the person operating MAX<br/>clicks something to shut off the output.<br/>     It is true that MAX can take a sequence of MIDI notes as an<br/>input and spit out depending on certain conditions. Again, this is<br/>where MAX proves so grossly musically inadequate. MAX has no useful<br/>way to *shaping* that MIDI sequence in a musical way. Ordinarily we<br/>would want to bunch up notes as we play &apos;em faster -- a human does<br/>this. It&apos;s very distinctive. A human playing the same passage fast on<br/>a piano plays the notes with a very differentn timing and rhythmic<br/>accent than the putatively same set of notes played slowly.<br/>    But no...MAX just vomits out the exact same MIDI sequence faster<br/>or slower. This is so anti-musical that it makes musicians dizzy.<br/>Computer geeks love it, of course, because of the object-oriented<br/>real time tech.  Musicians listen and their eyes start to pulsate<br/>like jellied napalm and their teeth begin to hurt. It&apos;s the<br/>classic &quot;blind grinding of a robot&apos;s gears&quot; syndrome. (Ivor Darreg&apos;s<br/>memorable phrase.)<br/>   The last problem I would like to cite with MAX involves the<br/>impossibility of understand a connection twixt cause and effect. Most<br/>MAX users appear to use this to generate more or less random outputs.<br/>I see it as a problem because when I build some MAX patch beyond a<br/>minimal complexity, I have no goddamn idea what the hell will vomit<br/>out of it.<br/>    Followers of the coin-flipping kook love this profoundly anti-<br/>musical flaw built into MAX. Real musicians typically despise this<br/>kind of thing, because it&apos;s not discernibly different from the<br/>trumpet player doing a riff in measure 10 that they&apos;re not supposed<br/>to do until measure 37, while the xylophonist is asleep, and the<br/>piano player is chatting up a chick and doing a I-IV-V-I vamp instead<br/>of broken dim 7th chords.<br/>    When the machine runs riot and starts vomiting out unpredictable<br/>output, I lose interest. In fact my interest in a musical system<br/>whose output cannot be adroitly controlled by the composer is<br/>measured in micro-give-a-sh*ts.  If the music is gonna sound like<br/>crap, please let it be my fault -- not the machine&apos;s.<br/>     By destroying a clear sense of cause and effect with all those<br/>cockamamey bangs and delay lines feeding back and around and inside<br/>out on themselves, MAX becomes a glorified casino -- not a system for<br/>composing music. If I want to go to a casino, I&apos;ll visit the Trump<br/>Palace, thank you, not the concert hall.<br/>     ---<br/>     Let me give you a really great example of music software which<br/>IS truly mondo and awesome and killer cool -- SuperCollider, written<br/>by James McCartney.<br/>      This language allows *both* large-scale compositional control<br/>(courtesy of built in Smalltalk-like commands) *and* Csound-type<br/>micro-level control of individual notes and timbral nuances blah blah<br/>blah.<br/>      SuperCollider is the way music software *should* work. Jame<br/>smCcartney is a friggin&apos; genius. This is mondo killer stuff. Best of<br/>all, it&apos;s now available as shareware.<br/>      MAX sucks by comparison with SuperCollider. MAX is a<br/>programming geek&apos;s misconceived idea of music software. SuperCollider<br/>is a musician&apos;s idea of music sofware.<br/>      --<br/>      How does this relate to microtonality?<br/>      SuperCollider allows you to build on the lowest to the highest<br/>levels. It lets you sculpt the large-scale composition to fit the<br/>tuning, it let&apos;s the fine-tune the timbres to fit the large-scale<br/>structure.<br/>      MAX is a runaway tank on the freeway. It crushes other cars and<br/>smashes into buildings, and whatever tuning you&apos;re in, tough tit<br/>bubba -- what you get is what you get, and given the hypercomplexity<br/>and countinetitive nature of the typical MAX patch, who knows what<br/>that&apos;ll be?<br/>      I have not yet heard any micrtonal music composed using MAX<br/>that sounded like anything worth a damn. It sounds like my neighbor&apos;s<br/>dog rolling around on a piano keyboard.<br/>      Carter Scholz has done some killer compositions using<br/>SuperCollider. They&apos;re all microotnal. Those some kickin&apos; jams, homey.<br/>      If MAX is Miller Puckette&apos;s idea of how to do music, then<br/>Milelr needs to put on a hawaiaan shirt, smoke some doobidge, take a<br/>poop, and go out &apos;n get laid.<br/>      That white boy been starin&apos; at that ole computah console too<br/>long, bubba.<br/>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div>
