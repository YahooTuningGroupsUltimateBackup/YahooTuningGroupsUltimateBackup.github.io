I&apos;ve heard some really good<br/>setups in studios that I&apos;ve worked in, but they were very rarely truly<br/>indistinguishable from a live performer. In a more realistic setting as<br/>Johnny Reinhard might be contemplating that includes affordable speakers on<br/>a stage, then, yes, I think most people could easily tell the difference.</p><p>While we&apos;re at it, not to muddy up the waters further, but there are<br/>several other subtle properties of an instrument like the Chromelodeon<br/>which would likely be very difficult for most samplers to reproduce. For<br/>example, the resonances of the cabinet, which depend on the combination of<br/>keys held down and which would not simply be additive as they would be<br/>reproduced on a sampler. Then there are the sounds of the keys releasing,<br/>noise of the pumping and air escaping, and (unless one is prepared to<br/>separately sample each key) the differences between different reeds. I<br/>point these things out not to shoot down the possibility of an effective<br/>reproduction of the chromelodeon for the purposes of live performance, but<br/>to illustrate further the difficulties of &quot;exact&quot; electronic reproduction.</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
