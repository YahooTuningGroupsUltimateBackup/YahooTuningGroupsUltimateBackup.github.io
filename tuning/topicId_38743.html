I would say I will &quot;catch up&quot;<br/>when I get back to New York, but since not much is happening on the<br/>list right now, that&apos;s not going to be so necessary.</p><p>I must say, though, that I am one of the *few* (admittedly)<br/>enthusiastic supporters of Yahoo.  I like the Web access, which makes<br/>it possible to post from *anyplace* as I am doing now, and I like the<br/>way the interface works with *all* the Internet Tuning Groups.</p><p>I think it is the best list format I have seen so far.<br/>(Sorry &quot;dissers&quot; but I do get a vote, too, yes??)</p><p>best,</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
