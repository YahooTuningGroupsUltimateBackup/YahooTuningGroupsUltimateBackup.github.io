It&apos;s called &quot;Beyond the Windows, Perhaps Among the<br/>Podcorn&quot; and it&apos;s around 55 minutes or so of glacial texture where the<br/>primary focus is on beating, timbre, space, and resonance. A must-hear!</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2007 9:00:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From: &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot;</p><p>&gt; Hey all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is something I did back in July, and for some dumb reason, never<br/>&gt; posted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/SteadyStateUniverse.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/SteadyStateUniverse.ogg</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/SteadyStateUniverse.mp3">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/SteadyStateUniverse.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, it&apos;s an ambient piece, done simply by applying some sound file<br/>&gt; stretching to an incredible Chinese group singing field recording I<br/>&gt; found on the &apos;net.

I&apos;m getting to where I can pick out the overtones.</p><p>I immediately thought of a didgeridoo when I started listening, because I&apos;m writing something right now that containts the instrument (I&apos;m having to use the square wave MIDI patch as a substitute, it doesn&apos;t work as well). Tibetan chant also came to mind.</p><p>~D.</p></div>
