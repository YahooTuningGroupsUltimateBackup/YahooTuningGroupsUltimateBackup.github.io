But in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria,<br/>&gt; Iraq, and the Arabian Peninsula, the maqamat that are used are<br/>&gt; _roughly_ subsets of 24-tET. Note that I say _roughly_. The 17-tone<br/>&gt; medieval Arabic tuning, however, fits none of these cultures at the<br/>&gt; present time (not sure if you were saying they do with your<br/>&gt; references to Western academic institutions -- you weren&apos;t clear).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

Touma book<br/>also support my these tunings<br/>&gt; and includes all the areas you mentioned.</p><p>Here&apos;s a snip from a review of Touma&apos;s book:</p><p><a href="http://www.turath.org/Articles/BookRev.html">http://www.turath.org/Articles/BookRev.html</a></p><p>&apos;Music of the Arabs, however, would not serve as a good introduction<br/>to readers not already familiar with the subject; in fact, it could<br/>be misleading. Throughout the book, Touma emphasizes regional folk<br/>music and rejects commonly accepted other musical forms of the Arab<br/>world due to possible western influence on them. While I completely<br/>endorse his viewpoint of trying to maintain the purity of Arabic<br/>music, I feel it is unrealistic to completely dismiss what the Arab<br/>people consider their primary musical experience simply because of<br/>the author&apos;s particular taste.&apos;</p><p>More:</p><p>&apos;The book mostly reflects Touma&apos;s own research in the folk music of<br/>North Africa and the Gulf states. While he addresses these two<br/>regions in great detail he chooses not to approach other regions of<br/>the Arab world or other musical styles with satisfying consistency<br/>within the covers of the same book. Such a book title, however,<br/>implies coverage of all music of all the Arabs, and as such, the<br/>pretension to be comprehensive does not meet expectations. A better<br/>title would have been &quot;Regional Arabic Folk Music.&quot; Touma stresses<br/>his dislike of western influence on Arabic music; a good point pushed<br/>to its limit. The reader is left with the impression that all non-<br/>folk musical productions are dismissed as illegitimate Arabic music<br/>including the works of greats like Mohammed Abdelwahab. In fact, this<br/>includes anybody who sang or performed with an Arab orchestra since,<br/>according to Touma, the traditional Arabic takht is the<br/>only &quot;acceptable&quot; ensemble. While composers and singers like Sayyid<br/>Darwish, Abdelwahab, and Um Kulthoum get mentioned in the book only<br/>in passing, Touma spends several paragraphs (and a picture) in praise<br/>of Munir Bashir. Although the latter is an excellent Iraqi &apos;ud player<br/>by any standard, it is still a puzzling presentation of the big<br/>picture of the music of the Arabs. For a different perspective, see<br/>Sahab&apos;s book &quot;The Seven Greats of Arabic Music,&quot; for example.&apos;</p></div>
