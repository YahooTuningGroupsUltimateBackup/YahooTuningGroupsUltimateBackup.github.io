Do you not feel that this kind of<br/>&gt;modification to other&apos;s compositions (whether public domain or not),<br/>&gt;represents a kind of &quot;distortion&quot; of the original intent of the<br/>&gt;composer?</p><p>Jacky, you didn&apos;t address this question directly to me, but my work,<br/>as much as anyone&apos;s on this list, enters into this realm of modifying<br/>(&quot;distorting&quot;) past works in ways that could not have been foreseen by<br/>the original composers.</p><p>This issue came up quite intensely around the end of 1999; I can point<br/>you to several exchanges more specifically if you&apos;re interested.  I<br/>think it&apos;s safe to say that the question will never be settled to<br/>everyone&apos;s satisfaction, but my own perspective is this:</p><p>   . It seems fair that any given work should be protected for some<br/>     reasonable period of time from any alteration(s) not approved by<br/>     the composer.  Such a mechanism is already in place with existing<br/>     copyright laws.  (at least, the original composer will be paid for<br/>     sales of any such modifications).</p><p>   . Music, IMO, does not ultimately &quot;belong&quot; to the person who dreams<br/>     it up and writes it down.  Everyone borrows from past works, and<br/>     everyone (whose music is worth anything) can expect to be borrowed<br/>     from, whether or not such borrowing is considered &quot;distortion&quot;.</p><p>   . A high percentage of derivations may be worthless junk, but (again<br/>     IMHO) we need not worry about degradation of great works, because<br/>     the junk eventually falls away; only good stuff lasts for decades<br/>     or centuries.</p><p>&gt;One other thing too is this: If Schoenberg&apos;s intention was to attempt<br/>&gt;to avoid &quot;tonality&quot; within the pitch set of 12tET, then is it your<br/>&gt;intention to give Schoeny a tuning that would help him along the way,<br/>&gt;such as 13tET? Or is it your intention to re-tune his (or other&apos;s)<br/>&gt;music to an unintended &quot;tonal&quot; system, such as JI? It could be<br/>&gt;perceived by many, that to impose something onto another&apos;s work,<br/>&gt;which was not their intention could represent a kind of &quot;trampling of<br/>&gt;the sacred&quot;.</p><p>My one and only standard is beauty, of necessity a highly personal<br/>view.  I really don&apos;t care a whit, ultimately, whether I&apos;m in alignment<br/>with or in direct opposition to the vision or wishes of the original<br/>composer, IF the results are of equal or greater beauty to my ears.<br/>I DO agree that I should not present my alterations as if they were<br/>sanctioned by the original composer if they are not.</p><p>&gt;Let me pose by analogy: What if you composed a piece of music in &quot;X-<br/>&gt;Tuning&quot;, that you felt delivered the desired intention of the music,<br/>&gt;and less than a hundred years from now, some future microtonalist(s)<br/>&gt;came along and found your tuning theory to be ludicrous, and decided<br/>&gt;to make &quot;improvements&quot; to your work, by imposing their own subjective<br/>&gt;tuning views onto your compositions? How would you (or your ghost)<br/>&gt;view this kind of &quot;hi-jacking&quot;?  When you compose new music, are you<br/>&gt;intending that others may be allowed to come along in the future and<br/>&gt;make alterations to the original intent of your music?</p><p>&gt;Let me know if this is ok. When you guys have left for the big<br/>&gt;microtone in the sky, I&apos;ve got some great ideas I&apos;d like to try out<br/>&gt;on your midi files - of course - I&apos;m unable to discuss these with<br/>&gt;the &quot;living&quot; victims at this time (although I have been wondering how<br/>&gt;Joe Monzo&apos;s work would sound with a &quot;house beat&quot;, and tuned to a 8000<br/>&gt;tone non-octave scale).   }:  )</p><p>What greater compliment can there be than taking one&apos;s work for<br/>modification?  If it pleases you, by all means modify anything in sight.<br/>Everything sorts itself out in the end.</p><p>This is, of course, a highly emotional subject, and many on this list<br/>disagree strongly with my perspective.  I will let them speak for<br/>themselves.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=17137 href="#17137">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>1/4/2001 7:42:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; [Jacky Ligon wrote:]<br/>&gt; Do you not feel that this kind of<br/>&gt; &gt;modification to other&apos;s compositions (whether public domain or<br/>not),<br/>&gt; &gt;represents a kind of &quot;distortion&quot; of the original intent of the<br/>&gt; &gt;composer?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky, you didn&apos;t address this question directly to me, but my work,<br/>&gt; as much as anyone&apos;s on this list, enters into this realm of<br/>modifying<br/>&gt; (&quot;distorting&quot;) past works in ways that could not have been foreseen<br/>by<br/>&gt; the original composers.</p><p>Your work stands as a pinnacle of excellence to me in the area of<br/>midi files/tuning, but I do not see it as the same thing as re-tuning<br/>Schoenberg.
