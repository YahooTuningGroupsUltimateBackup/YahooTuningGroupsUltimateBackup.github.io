Why isn&apos;t it proper.</p><p>In 19-tET, the 11-tone chain-of-minor-thirds MOS is 0 1 2 5 6 7 10 11 12 15<br/>16 (19). It&apos;s improper because the largest &quot;second&quot; (3/19 oct.: 2 to 5, 7 to<br/>10, 12 to 15, 16 to 19) is larger than the smallest &quot;third&quot; (2/19 oct.: 0 to<br/>2, 5 to 7, 10 to 12).</p><p>One reason propriety may be important in the diatonic scale (in any meantone<br/>tuning including 12-tET) is that a triad formed by stacking two thirds is a<br/>consonant 5-limit triad in 6 out of 7 positions. That these triads form the<br/>harmonic basis of common-practice diatonic music may rely on the fact that<br/>thirds can be melodically &quot;measured&quot; without any ambiguity. Evidence of this<br/>effect is provided by the fact that, in 12-tET, the augmented second in the<br/>harmonic minor scale sounds dissonant even though is acoustically identical<br/>to the consonant minor thirds in the scale.</p><p>My two decatonic scales in 22-tET are examples of proper scales that are not<br/>MOS. One of the scales, 0 2 4 6 9 11 13 15 17 20 (22), is distributionally<br/>even, and the other, 0 2 4 7 9 11 13 16 18 20 (22) is &quot;pentachordal&quot; (kind<br/>of like Chalmers&apos; &quot;tetrachordal&quot; but with more notes) in every octave<br/>species. Propriety may be important here because the tetrad constructed by<br/>stacking two &quot;fourths&quot; and a &quot;third&quot; is a consonant 7-limit tetrad in most<br/>positions. If one wishes to project a full 7-limit harmonic style that<br/>originates from melody, this aspect of propriety may be necessary.</p><p>Carl Lumma just visited me for a few days and he agreed with my feeling of<br/>amazement that no one had come up with the decatonic scales before me. The<br/>task of combining three harmonic functions (1,3,5 and 7) into a single,<br/>melodically coherent scale may have seemed impossible because, from the MOS<br/>standpoint, no single generator can create all these functions within a<br/>small number of notes. The trick to the decatonic scales is that each is<br/>composed of _two_ interleaved MOS pentatonic scales, _each_ of which is<br/>generated by a sharpened fifth and contains the harmonic functions 1, 3, and<br/>7 in two otonal and two utonal formations. These are not unlike the slendro<br/>scales some JI composers have formulated (but temperament allows a greater<br/>quantity of consonant 1:3:7 triads). The 5-function that completes all four<br/>(in the DE case) or three (in the pentachordal case) of these formations in<br/>one pentatonic is then found in the other pentatonic, for a total of eight<br/>or six consonant tetrads, respectively.</p><p>A similar trick can be used with two interleaved meantone diatonic scales.<br/>Each contains harmonic functions 1, 3, and 5 in three otonal and three<br/>utonal formations. If each is generated by a sufficiently _flattened_ fifth<br/>(such as that of 19-tET or 26-tET), then the 7-function that completes all<br/>six (in the DE case) or five (in the &quot;heptachordal&quot; case) of these<br/>formations in one diatonic is found in the other diatonic, for a total of<br/>twelve or ten consonant tetrads, respectively. The resulting 14-tone scales<br/>may be too complex, however, for propriety to work its magic on our ears<br/>(for one thing, intervals that would fall in the same equivalence class in<br/>the over-familiar diatonic scale are in different equivalence classes in<br/>this scale -- while the &quot;extra&quot; intervals in the decatonic scale tend to<br/>fall in the gaps between the conventional diatonic equivalence classes).</p></div>
