Does anyone know of a font containing them?  Ted Mook&apos;s Micro 2 does not<br/>appear to have them, and MidiDesign&apos;s Sonora &lt;<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2gn64">http://tinyurl.com/2gn64</a>&gt; has a<br/>only a bunch of otherworldly squiggly things. (Entertaining, but does anyone know<br/>how they were intended to be used?)</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Jacob</p></div>
