Can you put an upper</p><p>&gt;bound? What&apos;s the smallest mistuning that you can definitely hear</p><p>&gt;_as_ a mistuning?</p><p>Hmm,  that would depend on the interval and its location. Strings and spruce<br/>don&apos;t make a great test lab for sensory measurement on this order, there are<br/>a lot of  variables.  Two notes played on single strings, one after the<br/>other, sound different with a 1 cent change, (on a good day).<br/>    I can easily hear a .3 cent distance in a unison in the middle two<br/>octaves of the piano because it changes the phase relationship,(which, I<br/>know, is not the same as pitch discrimination),  however, at the top octave,<br/>this is moot.<br/>    On a lower bass note,  there is often this much difference between the<br/>corresponding partials, so how does one measure? ie,  If I find that the best<br/>unison between the bichords on A2 occurs with the 2nd or 3rd partials<br/>matched, I may still find that the fundamentals  off by .3 cents, (or the 5th<br/>or 8th etc. may be out that much).  The fact that the wound strings are less<br/>consistant than the plain wire, in terms of partial accuracy, means that it<br/>is very difficult to make blanket statements without defining &quot;where&quot; the<br/>inconsistancy occurs. (The synth crowd doesn&apos;t have this fuzzy signal to work<br/>with, more the pity)<br/>   I cannot hear a .3 cent change in the octave in the middle of the piano,<br/>but if I add that much stretch to say, a &apos;normal&apos;  A-A octave, that .3 cents<br/>begins to accumulate after two or three octaves and I can begin to tell that<br/>my double octaves or triple octaves are cleaner at the expense of the single<br/>on the A&apos;s,(if I have say, the adjacent Bb&apos;s tuned tighter).<br/>    .3 cents difference in an ET fifth is hard to judge than a Just fifth,<br/>but a full 1 cent change is noticeable in either.  Thirds don&apos;t sound<br/>different with much less than 1 cent  or so. I know I can tell the difference<br/>between two of them that have a full cent, especially if one is Just.<br/>However,  in the WT&apos;s I use so much of ,  I couldn&apos;t tell the difference<br/>between a 20cent third and a full comma one adjacent to it, the pitch<br/>location will change the speed as much as the extra cent.<br/>     I hear the difference between the key of F and Bb in a Young<br/>temperament, and that is the difference between an 8 cent tonic third and one<br/>of 10 cents. It is more difficult for me to tell the difference between the<br/>C# and F# keys, even though it is still 2 cents difference in their thirds,<br/>it is the difference between 19 and 21 cents.  I suspect that it would be<br/>easier for a musician of Mozart&apos;s day, who would have had a more discerning<br/>ear because of the cultural conditioning that was extant at the time.  Many<br/>of us have been equally poisoned during our growth and it does take a little<br/>effort to grasp the finer hues, sometimes.<br/>   There is much to be learned about the discrimination boundaries between<br/>the keys, but I am still mainly involved in getting people to hear that there<br/>CAN be a difference, if they will only unhook that 12ET I.V. from their<br/>emotional vein and let themselves become sensitized to the colors.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div>
