We would say that he evaluated consonance according to the<br/>least common multiple (LCM) of a chord.</p><p>A chord is &quot;complete&quot; if we cannot had a note to it without changing its<br/>LCM. For example,<br/>the chord 1 3 5 (C1 G2 E3) has a LCM of 15, it can be completed by adding<br/>the note with frequency ratio 15, yielding the complete chord 1 3 5 15 (C1<br/>G2 E3 B4). Of course, the chord will be &quot;more complete&quot;, but, according to<br/>Euler&apos;s model, it will have the same consonance.<br/>Euler&apos;s genus musicums (or musical modes) are the octave repetition of the<br/>complete chords. They are always rectangular on a square lattice and are<br/>caracterised by their LCM.</p><p>The music of A. D. Fokker and Jan Van Dijk makes use of the euler genera<br/>(modes).<br/>They built a 31TET organ to better express the septimal comma. (Recherches<br/>musicales, theoriques et pratiques, Archives du musee Teyler, 1951)</p><p>See this page for musical examples:<br/><a href="http://www.interlinx.qc.ca/~kami/fokker.html">http://www.interlinx.qc.ca/~kami/fokker.html</a></p><p>The notation Eu(x,y,z) refers to the LCM of the scale. For example,<br/>Canzone is Eu(2,0,1), meaning 3^2 * 5^0 * 7^1, or (3.3.7) in Fokker&apos;s<br/>notation.<br/>This would yield a complete chord of 1 3 7 9 21 63. After octave<br/>reduction, this is<br/>G 7Bb 7C C D 7F (where 7 is used to lower the pitch by 64/63).</p><p>Interpretation of a dominant seventh chord<br/>******************************************</p><p>Classical interpretation: 1/1 5/4 3/2 9/5 (36 45 54 64)<br/>Euler&apos;s interpretation: 1/1 5/4 3/2 7/4 (36 45 54 63, or 4 5 6 7)</p><p>D&apos;Alembert says that the seventh chord is &quot;too arbitrary and far from the<br/>true principles of harmony&quot;, but Euler says that the ear tolerates small<br/>deviations in the proportions of consonances: &quot;everytime this happens, he<br/>says, the perceived proportion is simpler that the one that is played, and<br/>the difference is so small (64/63) that it is not perceived.&quot; Therefore we<br/>can suppose that the ear substitutes 7/4 for 9/5, &quot;so that all the factors<br/>are divisible by 9, yielding the 4 5 6 7 chord, whose perception is less<br/>embarassing.</p><p>&quot;Maybe _this_ is the foundation of the rules about the preparation and<br/>resolution of dissonance, to warn the auditors the the same sound will<br/>express two different musical entities.&quot; (1)</p><p>&quot;The musical instruments tuned according to the principles of harmony use<br/>only proportions composed of the prime numbers 2, 3 and 5. But if my<br/>conjecture is right, says Euler, we can say that composers already imply<br/>the prime number 7 in their music and that the ear is already accustomed<br/>to it. If 7 is a perfection in composition (a consonance), maybe we should<br/>build instruments that support it.&quot;</p><p>***********************</p><p>(1) As is the case in any ET where 64/63 vanishes (like 12 and 22).</p><p>I accept constructive criticism, please correct any typo or error in this<br/>post.</p><p>BTW, my regular web page is currently offline, because I am working on a<br/>webpage for a customer.</p><p>-Kami</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/1999 11:07:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If someone has a translated version of the the euler. please post.
