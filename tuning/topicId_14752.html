I never heard if he ever gave a concert on the instrument and how it came out.<br/>    I was interested even though I have never seen one up close.  I started looking in the &quot;Grove Dictionary&quot; and found several tuning variations mentioned.  I am not sure I understand what the book is talking about.  Tunings could be:   d/G - g - d&apos; - g&apos;     d - G - g - d&apos; - g&apos;     G - G - d - c&apos; - c&apos;     &quot;Musical Instruments Through the Ages&quot; by Anthony Baines (1963) gave:   d (bourdon), G, g, d&apos; d&apos;       G, d, g, d&apos;, g&apos;   That looks like lots of 5ths to bow and lots of drone strings unless the player can press down two or more fingers on the fingerboard at one time.  If I were asked to play such an instrument I would certainly research more about the music of that era and NEVER claim to be an expert.   A violinist can learn to play to this kind of instrument, but I don&apos;t know how long it would take to become comfortable with these difference from violin to vielle.<br/>            Alita Morrison</p></div>
