Can you<br/>&gt; &gt; elaborate,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps with an example?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thats what I mean, except as the distance of the error<br/>increases, so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; increases the weight of the absolute unit of error by some<br/>factor or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; secondary scale based on psychoacoustic perception as opposed<br/>to a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; linear relationship.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Right. For small errors relative to an ideal JI interval, taking<br/>&gt; &gt; something proportional to the square of the error makes some<br/>sense to<br/>&gt; &gt; me as a way of assessing the &apos;awfulness&apos; of the resulting sound.<br/>But<br/>&gt; &gt; this levels off for larger errors and even turns around as you<br/>begin<br/>&gt; &gt; to approach other JI ratios.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you approach some other interval not traditionally<br/>&gt; psychoacoustically associated with the fifth, for instance, the m6,<br/>&gt; the weighting might curve factorially approaching the interval<br/>&gt; asymptotically.</p><p>Why is there a &quot;weighting&quot; when we&apos;re talking about only one<br/>interval? Perhaps we need to understand one another&apos;s terminology<br/>first. It seems to me that one can draw a continuous curve as a<br/>function of interval size, that depicts discordance. For example, see:</p><p><a href="/harmonic_entropy/?yguid=124315585">/harmonic_entropy/?yguid=124315585</a></p><p>&gt; At the &quot;turn around&quot;, perhaps the error weigh<br/>&gt; intervals calculated from another fundamental freq.</p><p>Another fundamental frequency? I don&apos;t understand. Can you illustrate<br/>with an example?</p><p>&gt; &gt; However, when optimizing tunings, this squaring or whatever you<br/>want<br/>&gt; &gt; to use may be irrelevant. For example, as I just told Carl,<br/>&gt; &gt; minimizing the maximum *squared* error is the same as minimizing<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; maximum *absolute* error.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Yes for optimization thats true.  For sorting and classification<br/>&gt; however it seems the more complex the weighting system, the more<br/>&gt; information can be packed into the numerical value itself.</p><p>What is it you&apos;re hoping to sort and classify, and what kind of<br/>information are you hoping to pack into a numerical value?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, for example, if the fifth is wide, maybe the absolute<br/>score<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; should be positive, and if the fifth is narrow, the absolute<br/>score<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; should be negative, without regard to the major and minor<br/>thirds.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, that would imply that wide fifths sound better than JI if<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; score was a good thing, or that narrow fifths sound better than<br/>JI if<br/>&gt; &gt; the score is one of &apos;demerit&apos;. However, I think *both* wide *and*<br/>&gt; &gt; narrow fifths sound worse than JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I dont mean positive and negative to assign perceptual quality, but<br/>to<br/>&gt; numerically oppose errors generated by narrow fifth scales and wide<br/>&gt; fifth scales.</p><p>Now why would you want to do that? Errors are errors, scales are<br/>another issue entirely . . . typically, different scale systems have<br/>different mappings to JI, so one can optimize and obtain narrow fifth<br/>scales for one mapping, wide fifth scales for another mapping, and<br/>scales not generated by the fifth at all for still other mappings.<br/>But it sounds like maybe you have something different in mind?</p><p>&gt; A system can thereby retain vector difference according<br/>&gt; to the position of the interval relative to JI.</p><p>Can you elaborate with an example?</p></div><h3><a id=60458 href="#60458">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2005 2:06:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; There are at most *two* independent variables, if we don&apos;t<br/>consider<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; transpositions as significant.
