This is useful because,<br/>for instance, if you&apos;re working within a tuning where that comma<br/>vanishes, it&apos;s good to know which intervals are equated.</p><p>I&apos;ll leave the derivation of this as an exercise for the reader. This<br/>actually yields two pairs of commas that are related.</p><p>1) Start with a comma - let&apos;s say 81/80.<br/>2) Come up with two intervals - a/b and c/d - which hypothetically<br/>differ by that comma. The goal here is to solve for a/b and c/d. Let&apos;s<br/>say a/b is the larger interval.<br/>3) If a/b and c/d differ by 81/80, then that means that (a/b) / (c/d)<br/>= 81/80, and hence a/b * d/c = 81/80.<br/>4) Thus ad = 81, and bc = 80. This is a slight algebraic<br/>simplification, but we&apos;re looking for the simplest intervals anyway.<br/>5) To find the simplest intervals that correspond to this property,<br/>get the two factors that are closest in size for ad = 81 and bc = 80.<br/>6) To get the two factors that are closest in size for 81, and also<br/>for 80, find some integer factorizer that lists all fractions of these<br/>numbers.<br/>7) Take the square root of the number. For 81, the square root is 9.<br/>If it works out like this nicely, you&apos;re done, because the two<br/>fractions that are closest in size for 81 will be 9 and 9. Sweet.<br/>8) For 80, the square root is 8.944. This doesn&apos;t work out. So in this<br/>case, pick the closest factors on either side of this number - 8 and<br/>10.<br/>9) So back to our example, if ad = 81, the simplest answers for a and<br/>d are a=9, d=9. If bc=80, the simplest answers for b and c are b=10,<br/>c=10.<br/>10) Plug these numbers back into the original fractions. So a/d and<br/>b/c correspond to 9/8 and 10/9, which are the two simplest intervals<br/>differing by 81/80 and hence equated in meantone.</p><p>Sometimes this works out to give you two pairs, rather than one. For<br/>instance, if you&apos;re trying to find the simplest intervals equated in<br/>porcupine -</p><p>- The porcupine comma is 250/243. So ad=250, bc=243.<br/>- The simplest factors here are ad = 10, 25, and bc = 9, 27.<br/>- Depending on how you assign these numbers, the two fractions this<br/>yields are 10/9 and 27/25, or 25/9 and 27/10.<br/>- Both are equated in porcupine temperament.</p><p>That&apos;s it. Very simple and straightforward. I have to run now, but<br/>I&apos;ll be back later with a list of intervals equated for some common<br/>temperaments.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=96213 href="#96213">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2011 11:58:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>As promised, here it is:</p><p>16/15 - 4/3 and 5/4<br/>25/24 - 5/4 and 6/5<br/>27/25 - 9/5 and 5/3<br/>81/80 - 9/8 and 10/9<br/>128/125 - 8/5 and 25/16, or 16/5 and 25/8<br/>250/243 - 10/9 and 27/25, or 25/9 and 27/10<br/>256/243 - 16/9 and 27/16<br/>648/625 - 27/25 and 25/24<br/>2048/2025 - 64/45 and 45/32<br/>3125/3072 - 125/64 and 48/25, or 25/64 and 48/125<br/>15625/15552 - 125/108 and 144/125<br/>20000/19683 - 125/81 and 243/160, or 160/81 and 243/125<br/>32805/32768 - 135/128 and 256/243, or 243/128 and 256/135</p><p>If anyone has a decent list of 7-limit commas, feel free to post them<br/>here and I&apos;ll work something out.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Thu, Feb 10, 2011 at 2:23 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; This is a pretty quick and dirty algorithm to find the simplest two<br/>&gt; intervals that differ by a particular comma.
