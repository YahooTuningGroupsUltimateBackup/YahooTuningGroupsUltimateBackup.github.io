Just a short note to explain my sudden disappearance,<br/>In case anyone thought that maybe I fell of the earth or something.<br/>I&apos;ve simply been too busy to keep up with the barrage of postings<br/>on the Tuning List lately.</p><p>So if anyone wrote something that requires a response from me,<br/>please resend it to me privately.  It may take a while to catch<br/>up to the List.</p><p>(And Paul:  I&apos;m still too preoccupied with other things to make<br/>the corrections to my webpages that you pointed out.  Just send<br/>me &quot;friendly reminders&quot; in another couple weeks...)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
