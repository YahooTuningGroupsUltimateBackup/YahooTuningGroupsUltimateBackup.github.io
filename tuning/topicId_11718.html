These are unstable sonorities with an effect<br/>&gt;at once &quot;coloristic&quot; and often cadentially oriented toward a stable trine<br/>&gt;or fifth.</p><p>The answer is, &quot;not much&quot; (hope that isn&apos;t too many decimal places for you!)<br/>Since this model uses a 1% (about 17-18 cents) frequency resolution, changes<br/>of 3.8 cents can only have minor effects on the results, and I would be<br/>tempted to call the difference &quot;negligible&quot;.</p><p>&gt;Anyway, thanks for another fascinating survey. Incidentally regarding the<br/>&gt;not-so-consonant qualities of the minor sixth: it is often ranked by<br/>&gt;13th-century theorists along with the minor second, major seventh, and<br/>&gt;tritone or diminished fifth as a strong dissonance. I wonder if the<br/>&gt;tension between the third partial of the lower note and the second partial<br/>&gt;of the upper note could contribute to this result, not only with a more<br/>&gt;complex ratio like the Pythagorean 128:81, but also with a pure 8:5.</p><p>The magic of harmonic entropy is that it does nothing more than reflect the<br/>mathematical fact that the more complex a ratio is (up to a point), the more<br/>simple ratios are close to it and confuse its perception. So yes, 8:5 is not<br/>one of the deepest minima in the harmonic entropy curve, because 3:2, 5:3,<br/>and 13:8 are all close enough to confuse the sensation somewhat. For ratios<br/>simpler than 8:5, such as 5:4 and 6:5, one will find less confusion from<br/>nearby ratios, and for those more complex than 8:5 (but not so complex that<br/>the ratio itself becomes irrelevant to the perception of the interval), one<br/>will find more confusion from nearby ratios. I posted a proof of this<br/>mathematical fact perhaps a month or two ago in response to a query by<br/>Joseph Pehrson.</p></div>
