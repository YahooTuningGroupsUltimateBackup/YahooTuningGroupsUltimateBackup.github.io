With recordings, is<br/>this necessary when one good recording is all that&apos;s needed. Maybe a tour!</p><p>Good question... I&apos;m pretty sure the answers would vary. I personally prefer<br/>the permanence of an idealized recording. (Idealized to the extant that the<br/>composer is satisfied with the performance, even if he did all the<br/>performing -- which may not be ideal!)</p><p>&gt;If I want my compositions played who am I going to get to play my<br/>microtonal guitar parts?</p><p>&gt;YOU!</p><p>Yes meager old me......</p><p>&gt;Isn&apos;t what you want you music to be heard as opposed to performed per se.</p><p>Both (ideally)... And as this would (ideally) require three microtonal<br/>guitarist to reduplicate the material live -- it just don&apos;t happen! And<br/>every performance is subject to a seriously scaled down version the<br/>compositions... And again my comment was (directed towards) what degree is<br/>the composer/performer a necessity of this kind of  &quot;specialization&quot;<br/>scenario&#xFFFD;(?)</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>PERLICH@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx</h3><span>9/19/1999 2:31:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;m glad we agree that Jeff Smith&apos;s article on Corporeal Meadows is vastly<br/>misrepresenting the prevalence of JI in the world&apos;s musical cultures.</p></div>
