For<br/>example, 23-equal is one of the cases where the &quot;best&quot; val is not set equal<br/>to the patent val:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=23&limit=7">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=23&limit=7</a></p><p>If you pick the 23d val, and stretch the octave to the TOP-RMS value, you do<br/>indeed end up with lower error than you do with the patent val. The same<br/>applies for 17c vs 17. So my question is: if you don&apos;t stretch the octave,<br/>and you prefer to work within the pure octave, how does this affect things?<br/>Or would the patent val then be the winner?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101192 href="#101192">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2011 3:20:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you pick the 23d val, and stretch the octave to the<br/>&gt; TOP-RMS value, you do indeed end up with lower error than<br/>&gt; you do with the patent val.

Or would the patent val then be the<br/>&gt; winner?</p><p>If you don&apos;t stretch the octave, you probably want smaller<br/>intervals to be more important than larger ones.  One rule<br/>is that about half of intervals within a Tenney limit are<br/>smaller than an octave, and some are very large.  For<br/>example, in the 23-limit, 23:22 is 77 cents and clearly<br/>audible (whether or not the 23-ness means anything) but<br/>23*22=506:1 is almost 9 octaves and that&apos;s beyond some<br/>people&apos;s hearing.  Even where they are audible, intervals<br/>much larger than an octave aren&apos;t that important musically.<br/>They don&apos;t fuse, they don&apos;t have many clashing partials,<br/>and you don&apos;t get many of them in chords.</p><p>When you start biasing the weighting towards small<br/>intervals, the resulting badness is much the same as you<br/>would have got by allowing the octave to be optimized.  So<br/>the easiest thing is to consider octaves on their merits.<br/>You can unstretch the scale to get pure octaves for tuning<br/>if that&apos;s what you want.</p><p>There are measures that work directly for pure octaves.<br/>You have to PDF if you want to research them.</p><p>                          Graham</p></div>
