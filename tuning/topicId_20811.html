Led off by a beautiful concert of the music of Bill Alves for gamelan instruments, cello, and viola, and after a short break Lou Harrison did a warm and witty presentation on his life with, and use of, just intonation and other tunings.</p><p>The afternoon then settled into a delivery of papers (weird: they don&apos;t use bicycles with baskets on the handlebars anymore). Your frequent contributor Joe Monzo did a nice presentation on his research into microtonality in Berlin before WWII. The final event of the day was a concert by John Schneider and Just Strings, featuring the early compositions of Partch; included in the program, just before intermission, was a screening of the film (video) of &quot;U.S. Highball&quot;, which provoked one audience member to yell out at the end &quot;We Love You Harry!&quot;.</p><p>As is usually the case at these event, it was a great treat to meet in person many of the people I&apos;ve corresponded with, some for years. One funny one was mistaking a fellow (from the rear) for Jonathan Glasier, and upon later apologizing to him finding out that he was Kyle Gann (well, they&apos;re both tall and greying...). Enjoyed hanging out at dinner with Kyle and David Doty, which is a true bridging of the coasts, at least over tapas. Lydia Ayers, Warren Burt, John Chalmers, Greg Schiemer, of course conference organizer Bill Alves -- lots of good people out here.</p><p>I&apos;m sure others will report back on the proceedings, since I had to come home. Still a lot of numbers being thrown around, but lots of music (and a real West coast feel to it) so I&apos;m sure the attenders will be having a great time.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;</p><p>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; <a href="mailto:jonszanto@yahoo.com">jonszanto@yahoo.com</a></p></div>
