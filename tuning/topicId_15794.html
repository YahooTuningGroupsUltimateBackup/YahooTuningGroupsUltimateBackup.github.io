Wouldn&apos;t that sound</p><p>&gt;&gt;horrible, especially given the inharmonicity of the piano?</p><p>Greetings,<br/>    Forgive the ambiguity.  The &quot;stretch&quot; I was speaking of was intentionally<br/>spreading octaves beyond what is necessary to satify ET.   All octaves are<br/>stetched somewhat, the pure fifths temperament goes beyond that, so I shall<br/>try to explain.<br/>   There is no such thing as a pure octave between strings that are producing<br/>the harmonic series. If the notes agree at their 2:1 ratio,  the  the common<br/>partials at the 4:2 and 6:3 will be beating.  Fix Justness at the 4:2 and the<br/>6:3 will slow donw, but the 2:1 will beat.   This is not a problem in the<br/>middle of the keyboard, but the cumulative effect to deal with this shapes a<br/>curve of sharpness or flatness as one heads for the extremes of treble or ba<br/>ss, repsectively.<br/>      A careful tuner allows the gradual widening of the octaves to occur so<br/>that the relationships of fourths, fifths, and thirds (or tenths)  will<br/>continue to reflect their relationships of the temperament as one progresses<br/>upward.    However, by C6 on a piano, if the single octaves are still pure,<br/>the double octaves will sound flat.  If the double octave sounds pure, the<br/>single octave beats.  So, if the octaves are kept at the 2:1 size, the treble<br/>begins to sound flat, and the bass begins to sound sharp, (which is perceived<br/>as &quot;weak&quot;).  &quot;Stretching&quot;  solves this.<br/>   Tuning a piano&apos;s bass section requires differing sizes of octaves.  In the<br/>middle of the piano, tuning the octave so that the 2:1 partial correspondance<br/>doesn&apos;t beat is normal, though a slight widening makes the unavoidable<br/>expansion later to be more gracefully dealt with.  However,  as you  head<br/>downward, the need for widening the octave shows itself in wider and wider<br/>octaves which favor the 4:2 and then even farther out from center, the 6:3.<br/>To do otherwise would cause the partials from the bass strings to depart from<br/>the fundamentals of the notes far above.<br/>   When I described the pure fifths style of tuning,  I was describing a<br/>tuning that stretches the octave enough to purify the fifths from where they<br/>were in the temperament octave, making the thirds faster than they would<br/>normally be, and making the octaves in the range of C5 on up beat more than<br/>what has normally been considered acceptable. You will find pure triple<br/>octaves in this tuning,but the smaller spans have quite a bit of &quot;roll&quot; to<br/>them.<br/>   There is no need to stretch for pure fifths in the bass, Plomp and<br/>Levelt&apos;s critical band stuff explains why we wouldn&apos;t hear the difference, so<br/>there are other factors that determine how much stretch works best down<br/>there.<br/>    I stretch the bottom octaves more in my non-studio tuning,(classical and<br/>jazz),  but in the commercial recording environment, sharpness in the bass<br/>reduces the number of complaints I get from bass players.    For a commercial<br/>tuner,  this is reason enough to reduce the stetch down there to a minimum.<br/>  Good is what doesn&apos;t slow a session down,  everything else is evil<br/>...........<br/>Regards,<br/>ED Foote<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=15803 href="#15803">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
