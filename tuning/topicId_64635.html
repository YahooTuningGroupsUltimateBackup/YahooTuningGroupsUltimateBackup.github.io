These overtones are quite loud and<br/>easily audible.</p><p>Why is it that playing the Tanpura, thus tuned, does not disturb the<br/>singer singing a raga which does NOT contain any of those in its<br/>scale? Or, contais only one of those?</p><p>Thanks in anticipation, and regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
