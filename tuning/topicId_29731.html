I was pleasantly surprised<br/>to hear music by Messaien, Earle Brown, Berio, George<br/>Crumb and plenty of other non-easy listening music<br/>broadcast this afternoon to my Windows machine in<br/>high-quality audio(it helps to have a T1 high-speed<br/>connection, I&apos;m sure, plus a Win2K powerhouse laptop).<br/>It sure helped keep my day of testing here at work a<br/>lot more engaging!</p><p>The Avant-Garde channel is for that kind of jazz, and<br/>may be similarly bold in its programming.</p><p>Only once, when I was playing the Bossa Nova channel,<br/>was music interrupted by an ad, and that was brief,<br/>and after more than an hour of listening. Spinner does<br/>put up a banner/control panel with a small panel with<br/>ads, however.</p><p>And listening from here I had only a rare &apos;digital<br/>blip&apos; in the broadcast.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Spinner can link you to CDNow, which<br/>sometimes has the album of what you&apos;re hearing<br/>available for purchase.</p><p>Of course, there are other sites with streaming<br/>avant-garde, including for example<br/><a href="http://www.radio.cbc.ca/programs/2newhours/2newhours.html">http://www.radio.cbc.ca/programs/2newhours/2newhours.html</a><br/>(plain CBC Radio 2 (classical) is at<br/><a href="http://www.radio.cbc.ca/cbcstereo.ram">http://www.radio.cbc.ca/cbcstereo.ram</a>)</p><p>Note Ruifeng and I will be performing at the El Paso<br/>Microtonal Hootenanny this coming weekend, and will be<br/>in Minneapolis &amp; Detroit the week after that, so keep<br/>that in mind. (Ruifeng is my new camerawoman!)</p><p>Hope you can enjoy these cool new stations too,<br/>Harold</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Make a great connection at Yahoo!

This is pretty<br/>cool... I was looking for something like this.</p><p>You&apos;re right, the 20th Century Music is actually pretty<br/>sophisticated...  Likewise the &quot;Avant Garde&quot; jazz and Renaissance<br/>music... and standards with &quot;Classical&quot; and Baroque... and African...<br/>about anything...</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>_______ _______ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
