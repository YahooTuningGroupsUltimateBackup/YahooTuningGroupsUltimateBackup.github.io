That&apos;s not just<br/>so that you can show it in the status bar, but also tells whatever program<br/>is going to organise the database what you want your document to be called.<br/>But,this is optional, and could be left out if thought too complicated.</p><p>Since the tree could have several folders with the same name, one has two<br/>choices = to give the entire path up to your entry, or just give the<br/>folder, but ensure each has a unique name.</p><p>However if one reflects on it, remembering that the folders could be<br/>nested several levels, the idea of just having to give one folder has<br/>many attractions.</p><p>To make sure each has a unique name, I suggested adding the date of creation<br/>of the folder, and showing that in the tree.</p><p>So to fill in the folder field, you need the name of the folder, and the<br/>date it was created. To find that, just go to the folder in the tree,<br/>and read it off.</p><p>Maybe one could use some other approach that would work as well or better.</p><p>Finally, to add a new folder, as one may want to do from time to time,<br/>one needs to give the new folder name, and the name of its parent. As<br/>usual, one also needs to give the date for the parent, and since one<br/>is making a new folder, one will give the current date as its date.</p><p>No more info is needed, so you leave the other fields blank, and it will<br/>then be clear that it is a folder.</p><p>So far, this will certainly work, and would be very easy to program for.</p><p>If all one wants are text or html documents with internal links, and<br/>none link to any of the others, then that&apos;s it done, no more to do.</p><p>Will make me happy, - hardly anything to do - maybe a few dozen lines<br/>of code plus some cut and paste of code libraries I&apos;ve already written.</p><p>John won&apos;t need to do much either until the last minute when he needs<br/>to put them all together to make the final faq.</p><p>At that point, my program can ftp all the entries, and just order them<br/>one after another in the order of the tree. At that point he can also move<br/>the folders around to arrange the sections, e.g. using Explorer or<br/>a tree control.</p><p>With a mostly text based FAQ, and no cross-linking, there&apos;s no need<br/>even to upload all the faq entries until the last minute when<br/>everything is ready.</p><p>The reason for all the other complications is that I had in mind that it<br/>would be an html type of tree, in which any page can refer to any other.</p><p>E.g. if you happened to be writing about the meantone temperaments,<br/>and felt my meantone calculation page was relevant, you might want<br/>to add a link to it.</p><p>But, how to do that.</p><p>To make that work, you need a url or other way of cross-referencing.</p><p>Start thinking about how to make that work smoothly and you will<br/>perhaps be lead to the same ideas I came to.</p><p>Or possibly some other approach. Maybe there is some other way<br/>that would work better.</p><p>Finally, if you want to include images and sound, that may require<br/>further thought about how to arrange all the folders.</p><p>I suggested keeping all the drafts in their original places, but<br/>also making an automatic copy of them in the prototype web site.</p><p>There, the html documents would be saved in a folder using the<br/>same name you give in the Author field.</p><p>Ditto for text documents.</p><p>E.g. if Margo Schulter does one of her ascii posts on Neo Gothic,<br/>it would go into the margoschulter folder<br/>and to refer to it you would use<br/>http://tuning_faq.com/margoschulter/sumer_is_icumen_in.htm<br/>or whatever it is.</p><p>To make this work, we need a second copy of the tree that<br/>links to the files on the prototype web site instead of the<br/>original drafts.</p><p>My program would then automatically ftp all the original files<br/>into this folder, place appropriate links into the tree control<br/>and also add the html navigation links at the top of each page.</p><p>Here was my example of what it would look like:</p><p><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/site_ex/tree.htm">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robertwalker/site_ex/tree.htm</a></p><p>I did it by hand, not having written the program yet, but it is<br/>all totally routine and easy to do and program for.</p><p>Now, because the tree control only works within frames, I added<br/>extra links to the top of the page to hide the tree.</p><p>So when you want to link to a page, first navigate to it in the<br/>tree, then click hide tree. You will then see the url proper,<br/>and be able to copy it to use in your link.</p><p>If writing in ascii, that&apos;s okay - just paste the<br/>link into your document.</p><p>My program can then save your document as html with the<br/>these all made into links.</p><p>Right, so far we&apos;ve got an html site for the FAQ. This will<br/>work fine for Newbies who like to use html browsers.</p><p>It can even include music, and graphics, and vrml models too,<br/>as would be totally appropriate for an html site.</p><p>Here, I added the bit about need for html authors to<br/>specify sub-folders to put their graphics and music<br/>files into, to avoid getting them muddled with<br/>each other.</p><p>The method I suggested there was a bit more complicated than<br/>it need be. Easiest is just to add the folder name to the<br/>author field of the table</p><p>So database entry then would be something like this:<br/>CPs Sets in VRML &lt;date&gt;; dekany ; http://..../dekany.htm ; robertwalker/dekany</p><p>That would put my dekany.htm file into a new folder called dekany<br/>in my main folder on the faq site. All the midi clips referred<br/>to in it would go into the same site.</p><p>Okay, that&apos;s just a subtlety to do with how the html version of the<br/>tree will work.</p><p>NOw back to the ascii.</p><p>What&apos;s going to happen to all the cross-links when the tree<br/>(or part of it) is exported as an ascii faq?</p><p>I suggest that they are just converted into references to the<br/>authors and titles of the documents.</p><p>E.g.</p><p>http://tuning_faq.com/margoschulter/sumer_canon.htm</p><p>would be converted to</p><p>See Margo Schulter&apos;s article &quot;Sumer canon, discant cadences, meantone&quot;</p><p>Graham Breed raised the point of what to do about ascii diagrams<br/>and normal graphics.</p><p>One could make a document that incorporates both, with text<br/>instructions within the document to say which is which.</p><p>But on reflection, and to stop it getting overcomplicated,<br/>it&apos;s probably better if one adds an extra field to the database<br/>saying</p><p>Suitable for Ascii (Y or N)</p><p>Then when it is time to make the ascii FAQ, only entries marked<br/>as suitable for ascii will be used.</p><p>If an entry isn&apos;t suitable, but could be converted, the author<br/>could be asked if they are interested in converting it.</p><p>Graham Breed also raised the question of what to do about<br/>links to bookmarks in html, and to references to sections in ascii.</p><p>For section references in ascii, easiest is just to leave them as<br/>they are.</p><p>There is no way a program can figure out that the text</p><p>&quot;see 1.1.2&quot;</p><p>is a hyperlink to section 1.1.2 when it is all in ascii, and everyone<br/>is using slightly different formats (and the page is perhaps full<br/>of numbers, decimal points, and so on).</p><p>This is the sort of thing a human can convert easily , but takes<br/>massive amounts of programming - easier to convert the whole faq<br/>by hand. I&apos;m not volunteering to do it!!</p><p>It could be done easily however if one used some kind of conventional<br/>tag, say $$ or something, to mark the sections, and the references to<br/>them, so the program knows what they are all about, with the tag removed<br/>from the final ascii of course.</p><p>The other way round, the program can easily find all the hypertext<br/>links in the html, and convert them to ascii section headings, and<br/>1.1.1, 1.1.2, ..., and &quot;see 1.1.2&quot;, &quot;see 1.1.3&quot;, ...</p><p>Problem then is how to get it to choose a sensible numbering system<br/>to fit in with the layoaut of the page, and again, this is<br/>for all practical purposes impossible, but could be made easy<br/>by devising some suitable tags.</p><p>If that&apos;s too complicated, then the only option is to leave out<br/>all the links.</p><p>I reckon that maintaining html documents that are also suitable for<br/>ascii could be pretty tricky to do.</p><p>But, many html documents don&apos;t really use internal links that much.</p><p>E.g, a common format is to list links to all the section headings<br/>at the head of the page, and then at the end of each section, have<br/>a link that goes back to the top of the page.</p><p>That would work fine in ascii, as one can&apos;t hyper-jump from one<br/>point to another anyway.</p><p>Just leave the list of section headings at the top, but change<br/>them into plain ascii.</p><p>Maybe it won&apos;t look quite as nice as if it was originally<br/>composed in ascii, but will be perfectly readable, and<br/>if there is anything that seriously impairs readability,<br/>John can edit it (or get someone to do it, considering the<br/>likely size of the FAQ).</p><p>And, there we are, I think that would work.</p><p>Any comments?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=19684 href="#19684">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>3/2/2001 5:53:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Robert,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Maybe it will help to explain motivation for the database approach<br/>&gt; very simply.<br/>&gt; Any comments?</p><p>Both the database, and an attempted &quot;simple explanation&quot;, are<br/>admirable.</p><p>I copied the rest of your message and put it in a text file.
