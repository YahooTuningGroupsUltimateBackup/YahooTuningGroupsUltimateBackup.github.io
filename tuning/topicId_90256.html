Twelve sets each one formed by 52 successive and ordained products of very small intervals, reach the (9/8)^6 frequency or the first great cycle that contains 624 cells; it is greater than the octave by one pythagorean comma.</p><p>The small intervals or cells are the results of M, J, U generators; M equals to the schisma (1.00112915039) while J and U were deduced some decades before the end of the past century. They work sequentially, the basic aspect I introduced to let them to work for establishing the geometric progression. Their values and sequence, that is, the cyclical places along the progression where these three generators operate, defined the set cycles of (9/8)^(1/2), (9/8), (9/8)^(3/2), (9/8)^2, .......... (9/8)^6, which is the first great cycle. Theoretically, there is an infinite number of great cycles.</p><p>Perfect fifths and fourths of any cell give the frequencies of higher cells; these extraordinary abilities and other important ones were &quot;thought and realized&quot; by the generators.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro<br/>Lima, June 11.</p><p>__________ Informaci&oacute;n de ESET NOD32 Antivirus, versi&oacute;n de la base de firmas de virus 5191 (20100611) __________</p><p>ESET NOD32 Antivirus ha comprobado este mensaje.</p><p><a href="http://www.eset.com">http://www.eset.com</a></p></div>
