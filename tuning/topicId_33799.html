For me, the<br/>&gt; only reason 0c:400c:700c is called a major triad in 12-tET is<br/>because<br/>&gt; it&apos;s an acceptable approximation _and_ it&apos;s the _only_ approximation<br/>&gt; &gt; available.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ****Hi Dave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, this is logically true.  However, in the paragraph above you<br/>&gt; say &quot;the only reason Oc:400c:700c *is* called a major triad...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s the crux of it.  Whether it makes any sense or not that *is*<br/>&gt; what it&apos;s called by almost all practicing musicians today, since<br/>&gt; virtually *all* of them work in 12-tET.</p><p>But when they begin to work in Blackjack one should remind them that<br/>although the 12-tET major third is indeed a kind of major third (namely a<br/>wide one) we now have a much better one available, an essentially just one.<br/>You don&apos;t seem to have a problem with calling a 4:5 a just major third. One<br/>synonym for &quot;just&quot; is &quot;true&quot;. It is the 12-tET one that is the<br/>approximation, not the other way around. I think most musicians are smart<br/>enough to understand this when it&apos;s explained to them, even if they are<br/>12-tET trained. At least in this country&apos;s universities and conservatoria<br/>they are usually taught briefly about Just scales somewhere in their<br/>training.</p><p>&gt;  I believe Paul Erlich has<br/>&gt; pointed to studies that show that even *string* players, since the<br/>&gt; advent of many works with strings and piano, particularly, tend to<br/>&gt; play in 12-tET, even though one might think they would play in just<br/>&gt; or Pythagorean.</p><p>Is there anyone out there with studies (or even anecdotes) that show that<br/>this can change in a very short time if the string player (or vocalist?) is<br/>asked to play along with other instruments tuned in say Just, meantone or<br/>Pythagorean? It is of course essential that one first retunes the open<br/>strings appropriately.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Should we refer to the 1/4 comma meantone major third (4:5) as a<br/>&gt; &gt; twelfth-low major third too?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ****I guess yes, if you were describing in in 72-tET.</p><p>72-tET or not is irrelevant. A thought experiment: Assume I have a keyboard<br/>tuned to a 12-note meantone, a little toward 1/3-comma from 1/4-comma, so<br/>that its G:B interval is 383.33 cents (same as the G:Bv interval in<br/>Blackjack). Let&apos;s say at first you don&apos;t even know how the keyboard is<br/>tuned. I play that interval for you and ask you what kind of third you<br/>think it is. What do you say? Then I lie and say the keyboard is tuned in a<br/>subset of Blackjack. Now what do you call that kind of interval? Then I<br/>tell you I lied and it is actually in a meantone. What do you call it now?<br/>Will you ask, in each case, what notation I am using for the pitches?</p><p>The underlying principle of the interval naming scheme I favour did not<br/>originate with me, but apparently with Adriaan Fokker in the 1970s. It is<br/>also the one used in one of our most indispensable tools, Scala.</p><p>The priciple is to associate an interval name with a particular interval<br/>width (in cents or ratios), or a small range around that, irrespective of<br/>what scale or tuning the interval is currently a part of. The major third<br/>that is considered not to need a qualifier is the simplest Just one (4:5)<br/>or the best approximation of it in a given tuning (provided it is a good<br/>enough approximation).</p><p>So Joseph and Paul, you are apparently the first to object to this<br/>principle in the history of this list. Why only now?</p><p>&gt; &gt; You seem to be saying that G-Bv-D is a &quot;correct&quot; major triad, but<br/>&gt; you want to call it a twelfth-low major triad. Seems a<br/>contradiction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ****Well, Dave, since the &quot;B&quot; is &quot;modified&quot; by a &quot;v&quot; it has to<br/>&gt; be &quot;altered&quot; or &quot;twelfth-low.&quot;</p><p>Yes the pitch is notated as a twelfth-low B. But that doesn&apos;t have to make<br/>the G:Bv interval (essentially a 4:5 in this case) a twelfth-low major<br/>third, when it is in fact a just or true, major third.</p><p>In thinking back over other recent posts of yours it becomes apparent to me<br/>that you have a confusion between pitches and intervals. For example you<br/>apparently assumed that because Blackjack has 21 pitches per octave it must<br/>also have 21 kinds of interval per octave, when in fact it has 41. This<br/>seems to be a common confusion, and there is no penalty for such confusion<br/>in 12-tET or indeed any equal temperament. Such confusion is encouraged by<br/>the I II III IV ... system for naming diatonic pitches independent of key.<br/>But if one is to break away from ETs it is a confusion that must be overcome.</p><p>&gt;  So, yes, I prefer that G-B-D in<br/>&gt; an &quot;unaltered state&quot; be our traditionally wide 12-tET triad.</p><p>You said it! I totally agree. G:B:D in 6x12-notated Miracle temperament<br/>represents a &quot;wide&quot; major triad. :-)</p><p>&gt; &gt; And so, you want to base your interval nomenclature on those that<br/>&gt; are  out of tune? I still don&apos;t get it. Why?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ****Why?  Because that&apos;s what hoards of players in conservatories<br/>and<br/>&gt; music schools have studied and are *used* to.  And, I believe that&apos;s<br/>&gt; what they are going to study for the conceivable future.  I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; heard of any schools, except for isolated cases at the New England<br/>&gt; Conservatory, to offer anything different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The system that *you* would like where G-B-D *is* 4:5:6 is<br/>&gt; essentially the system advocated by Ben Johnston and we&apos;ve found<br/>&gt; quite a few inconsistencies trying to reconcile that even to the<br/>&gt; basic Pythagorean-based staff.</p><p>Oh dear. Now your confusion of intervals and pitches causes you to<br/>misrepresent me. [Thanks Paul for pointing this out while I was away]. I do<br/>_not_ want 4:5:6 (or its nearest approximation in a given tuning) to be<br/>notated G:B:D except in temperaments where the syntonic comma (80:81)<br/>vanishes, i.e. meantones.</p><p>I have said before that I do not favour Ben Johnston&apos;s notation and<br/>consider that, in any tuning, the 7 nominals FCGDAEB should always be<br/>applied to a chain of approximate 2:3&apos;s where these exist. Otherwise<br/>modulation becomes too messy.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d be saying to the musicians, &quot;No. Not a 12-tET major third, we<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t have to put up with that crap any longer. We want a real<br/>&gt; &gt; true just proper pure major third. You know, the kind you can tune by<br/>&gt; &gt; ear. The barbershop harmony kind. _That&apos;s_ what we call a major third<br/>&gt; &gt; in _this_ scale.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Like I say, that&apos;s what Ben Johnston tries to do and he *does*<br/>&gt; get performances.  However he mostly *doesn&apos;t* get performances.</p><p>No that&apos;s _not_ what Ben Johnston does. Or at least that&apos;s not what Ben<br/>Johston does that&apos;s objectionable. Ben Johnston wants to notate the pitches<br/>making up the major third as e.g. G:B. I want them notated as e.g. G:Bv.</p><p>&gt; What I&apos;m saying is very obvious and simple:  just, for the<br/>notational<br/>&gt; convenience, keep the 12-tET pitches *as is* since they are what<br/>&gt; everybody has practiced and studied, and everything else is<br/>&gt; a &quot;deviation...&quot;</p><p>I totally agree (but perhaps for different reaszons). Note that you&apos;re<br/>talking here about pitches and scores with notations for pitches, not<br/>intervals or names for intervals.</p><p>So I believe the rest of your objections to my _interval_naming_ scheme<br/>were irrelevant since I&apos;m not talking about changing scores, except perhaps<br/>some of the letters above guitar chord diagrams.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a><br/>When remembering the recent horrific acts of violence, let us not forget<br/>that on September 11th there were 35,000 other very innocent victims.<br/>For that is the number of children dying every day from<br/>starvation-related causes.

However, in the paragraph above you<br/>&gt; &gt; say &quot;the only reason Oc:400c:700c *is* called a major triad...&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s the crux of it.  Whether it makes any sense or not that *is*<br/>&gt; &gt; what it&apos;s called by almost all practicing musicians today, since<br/>&gt; &gt; virtually *all* of them work in 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But when they begin to work in Blackjack one should remind them that<br/>&gt; although the 12-tET major third is indeed a kind of major third (namely a<br/>&gt; wide one) we now have a much better one available, an essentially just<br/>one.<br/>&gt; You don&apos;t seem to have a problem with calling a 4:5 a just major third.<br/>One<br/>&gt; synonym for &quot;just&quot; is &quot;true&quot;. It is the 12-tET one that is the<br/>&gt; approximation, not the other way around. I think most musicians are smart<br/>&gt; enough to understand this when it&apos;s explained to them, even if they are<br/>&gt; 12-tET trained</p><p>but these musicians will never have to deal with a 400-cent<br/>interval in blackjack!  the only intervals near it that they<br/>will ever get are 350, 383&amp;1/3, and 433&amp;2/3 cents!</p><p>&gt; The priciple is to associate an interval name with a particular interval<br/>&gt; width (in cents or ratios), or a small range around that, irrespective of<br/>&gt; what scale or tuning the interval is currently a part of. The major third<br/>&gt; that is considered not to need a qualifier is the simplest Just one (4:5)<br/>&gt; or the best approximation of it in a given tuning (provided it is a good<br/>&gt; enough approximation).</p><p>i&apos;m pretty sure i agree with you here, Dave.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; You seem to be saying that G-Bv-D is a &quot;correct&quot; major triad,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but  you want to call it a twelfth-low major triad. Seems a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; contradiction.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ****Well, Dave, since the &quot;B&quot; is &quot;modified&quot; by a &quot;v&quot; it has to<br/>&gt; &gt; be &quot;altered&quot; or &quot;twelfth-low.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes the pitch is notated as a twelfth-low B. But that doesn&apos;t have to make<br/>&gt; the G:Bv interval (essentially a 4:5 in this case) a twelfth-low major<br/>&gt; third, when it is in fact a just or true, major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In thinking back over other recent posts of yours it becomes apparent to<br/>me<br/>&gt; that you have a confusion between pitches and intervals. For example you<br/>&gt; apparently assumed that because Blackjack has 21 pitches per octave it<br/>must<br/>&gt; also have 21 kinds of interval per octave, when in fact it has 41. This<br/>&gt; seems to be a common confusion, and there is no penalty for such confusion<br/>&gt; in 12-tET or indeed any equal temperament. Such confusion is encouraged by<br/>&gt; the I II III IV ... system for naming diatonic pitches independent of key.<br/>&gt; But if one is to break away from ETs it is a confusion that must be<br/>overcome.</p><p>ah, Dave, i think you&apos;ve hit on the origin of this kind of confusion.<br/>I II III IV ... is an outgrowth of diatonic thinking, and the<br/>problems with using successive numbers like that to describe<br/>u n e q u a l   scale steps is related to staff notation.</p><p>humans are often willing to slap a numbering system onto<br/>anything which needs to be described in some kind of order,<br/>without thinking thru all the ramifications of that numbering.</p><p>the problem comes in when the numbers are used for analytical<br/>purposes which try to reduce everything to a single unit<br/>basis for measurement.  when calculating, we naturally think<br/>of successive numbers as representing a continuous identical<br/>increase.</p><p>but this is not the case with diatonic scale numbering!<br/>the I II III IV... ignores the fact that some scale steps<br/>are &quot;whole steps&quot; and some are &quot;half steps&quot;, or in our<br/>usual parlance here, some are L and some are s.</p><p>i think the quibbling now over what to call different<br/>72edo &quot;major 3rds&quot; has its basis in this.</p><p>12edo-based thinking is simply an easy solution to this problem,<br/>because for the diatonic scale it gives you s=1, L=2; in which<br/>case, using Arabic numerals instead of Roman, it&apos;s much more<br/>sensible to call the diatonic scale 0 2 4 5 7 9 11.  but then,<br/>of course, the diatonic logic is destroyed, because everything<br/>is measured in terms of &quot;half-steps&quot;, instead of the diatonic<br/>&quot;scale steps&quot; which can be either &quot;whole&quot; or &quot;half&quot;.</p><p>would harmonic analysis in blackjack employ Roman numerals<br/>similarly to the way they&apos;re used in diatonic music?  does the<br/>decatonic blackjack &quot;scale&quot; really function as a scale the<br/>same way the diatonic scale does in diatonic music?</p><p>&gt; &gt;  So, yes, I prefer that G-B-D in<br/>&gt; &gt; an &quot;unaltered state&quot; be our traditionally wide 12-tET triad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You said it! I totally agree. G:B:D in 6x12-notated Miracle temperament<br/>&gt; represents a &quot;wide&quot; major triad. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And so, you want to base your interval nomenclature on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; those that are  out of tune? I still don&apos;t get it. Why?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ****Why?  Because that&apos;s what hoards of players in conservatories<br/>&gt; &gt; and music schools have studied and are *used* to.  And, I believe<br/>&gt; &gt; that&apos;s what they are going to study for the conceivable future.<br/>&gt; &gt; I haven&apos;t heard of any schools, except for isolated cases at<br/>&gt; &gt; the New England Conservatory, to offer anything different.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The system that *you* would like where G-B-D *is* 4:5:6 is<br/>&gt; &gt; essentially the system advocated by Ben Johnston and we&apos;ve found<br/>&gt; &gt; quite a few inconsistencies trying to reconcile that even to the<br/>&gt; &gt; basic Pythagorean-based staff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh dear. Now your confusion of intervals and pitches causes you to<br/>&gt; misrepresent me. [Thanks Paul for pointing this out while I was away]. I<br/>do<br/>&gt; _not_ want 4:5:6 (or its nearest approximation in a given tuning) to be<br/>&gt; notated G:B:D except in temperaments where the syntonic comma (80:81)<br/>&gt; vanishes, i.e. meantones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have said before that I do not favour Ben Johnston&apos;s notation and<br/>&gt; consider that, in any tuning, the 7 nominals FCGDAEB should always be<br/>&gt; applied to a chain of approximate 2:3&apos;s where these exist. Otherwise<br/>&gt; modulation becomes too messy.</p><p>and i certainly agree with that, too.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;d be saying to the musicians, &quot;No. Not a 12-tET major third, we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; don&apos;t have to put up with that crap any longer. We want a real<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; true just proper pure major third. You know, the kind you can tune by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ear. The barbershop harmony kind. _That&apos;s_ what we call a major third<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in _this_ scale.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ***Like I say, that&apos;s what Ben Johnston tries to do and he *does*<br/>&gt; &gt; get performances.  However he mostly *doesn&apos;t* get performances.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No that&apos;s _not_ what Ben Johnston does. Or at least that&apos;s not what Ben<br/>&gt; Johston does that&apos;s objectionable. Ben Johnston wants to notate the<br/>pitches<br/>&gt; making up the major third as e.g. G:B. I want them notated as e.g. G:Bv.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What I&apos;m saying is very obvious and simple:  just, for the<br/>&gt; notational<br/>&gt; &gt; convenience, keep the 12-tET pitches *as is* since they are what<br/>&gt; &gt; everybody has practiced and studied, and everything else is<br/>&gt; &gt; a &quot;deviation...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I totally agree (but perhaps for different reaszons). Note that you&apos;re<br/>&gt; talking here about pitches and scores with notations for pitches, not<br/>&gt; intervals or names for intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I believe the rest of your objections to my _interval_naming_ scheme<br/>&gt; were irrelevant since I&apos;m not talking about changing scores, except<br/>perhaps<br/>&gt; some of the letters above guitar chord diagrams.</p><p>but here&apos;s the thing i&apos;m totally puzzled about: why such a big<br/>deal over how to label the blackjack interval measured as<br/>3 secors + 1 quomma?  it&apos;s darn close to the 5:4 ratio, and<br/>the only other intervals which blackjack provides anywhere<br/>near this are:</p><p> blackjack interval       ~cents</p><p>3 secors (a &quot;neutral 3rd&quot;)  350<br/>3 secors + 2 quommas        417<br/>{2 secors + 6 quommas       433<br/>{4 secors - 1 quomma        433</p><p>i know that Joe Pehrson is concerned about having 12edo-trained<br/>musicians be able to play his blackjack compositions, but the<br/>400-cent &quot;3rd&quot; has nothing to do with blackjack, so why even<br/>invoke it?  i personally think that Graham&apos;s decimal notation<br/>on a 4-line staff works much better with blackjack; see my example<br/>at &lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/blackjack/blackjack.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/blackjack/blackjack.htm</a>&gt;<br/>and the links to Graham&apos;s pages.  but i know Joe objects to that<br/>because of the learning curve involved.</p><p>Joe, i understand your objections.  but you&apos;re already using<br/>a *notation* that&apos;s based on 12edo (by way of 72edo), so if<br/>you write a piece of music in blackjack and put it in front<br/>of a trained musician, s/he will play Bv a little flatter<br/>than B, and you&apos;ll get something close to what you want.<br/>but *since blackjack does not offer a 400-cent interval*,<br/>what&apos;s the harm in calling that simply a &quot;major 3rd&quot;?</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=33888 href="#33888">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/9/2002 7:50:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 2/8/02 9:59:11 PM Eastern Standard Time, <a href="mailto:joemonz@yahoo.com">joemonz@yahoo.com</a><br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; but these musicians will never have to deal with a 400-cent<br/>&gt; interval in blackjack!  the only intervals near it that they<br/>&gt; will ever get are 350, 383&amp;1/3, and 433&amp;2/3 cents!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Joe, will these musicians ONLY play Blackjack?

Actually, it *is* true I am mostly used to ETs (I mean<br/>&gt; the &quot;Earthly&quot; kind) and, specially, of course 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So your chart which initially showed 41 intervals at first looked<br/>&gt; like &quot;StudLoco&quot; to me.  However, after Paul Erlich pointed it out, I<br/>&gt; quickly saw that the number of *pitches* and number of *intervals*<br/>&gt; did not coincide.  Your recent &quot;elaboration&quot; with &quot;examples&quot; on this<br/>&gt; chart makes the intervallic situation now immediately clear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, the intervallic multiplicity seems like a real &quot;feature&quot;<br/>&gt; not a &quot;bug&quot; of non-equal systems!  :)  My guess, and you can/should<br/>&gt; correct me if I&apos;m wrong, is that the doubling of the interval<br/>&gt; possibilities results from the assymetry of the scale caused by the<br/>&gt; presence of the *TWO LITTLE* 33-cent intervals right in a row<br/>&gt; surrounding B[.  That would result in *two different* intervals<br/>&gt; associated with any one of the other pitches in the scale, correct?<br/>&gt; Hence the &quot;doubling...&quot;</p><p>Yes. That&apos;s certainly one way of looking at it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The system that *you* would like where G-B-D *is* 4:5:6 is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; essentially the system advocated by Ben Johnston and we&apos;ve found<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; quite a few inconsistencies trying to reconcile that even to the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; basic Pythagorean-based staff.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh dear. Now your confusion of intervals and pitches causes you to<br/>&gt; &gt; misrepresent me. [Thanks Paul for pointing this out while I was<br/>&gt; away]. I do _not_ want 4:5:6 (or its nearest approximation in a<br/>given<br/>&gt; tuning) to be notated G:B:D except in temperaments where the<br/>syntonic<br/>&gt; comma (80:81) vanishes, i.e. meantones.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***But does it really make sense to notate a 12-tET G:B the *same<br/>&gt; way* as a 1/4 comma meantone G:B, for instance?</p><p>It does to me, and a helluva lot of other people.</p><p>&gt; It would seem the notation would not be so specific in that case,<br/>yes?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In 72-tET, of course, the example in 1/4 comma meantone would be<br/>&gt; close to the &quot;altered&quot; third:  G:Bv</p><p>Yes.
