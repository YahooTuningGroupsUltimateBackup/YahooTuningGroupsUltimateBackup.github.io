If they don&apos;t<br/>&gt; force any octave repetition, I&apos;m OK with it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _________________________________________</p><p>When my old Proteus 1 was still working, there was a general pitch table tuner.<br/>You could tune each one of the midi keys any way you wanted (by cents, too).<br/>So that means that each note of the entire 88 or more keys of the midi setup was<br/>tunable.  Every synth module has this feature (even software synths have this<br/>feature.  You would have to get a macro program for automation).  The trick is<br/>to find one that has capabilities for storing pitch tables.  The Proteus 1 could<br/>store only one.  A sequencer with a disk save feature could remedy this because<br/>you could store the pitch tables on the sequencer/sys-ex editor.  There are many<br/>modules that allow you to store many pitch tables so a sequencer would not be<br/>necessary.</p><p>&gt; _______________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________</p><p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~troubledoor">http://home.earthlink.net/~troubledoor</a></p><p>symmetric keyboard:<br/><a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/instrum.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/instrum.htm</a></p></div><h3>Jacky Ligon &#x3C;jacky_ekstasis@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2000 11:06:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Troubledoor,</p><p>I hope this message finds you well.</p><p>The Antares Autotune program is a plugin that lets the user retune a<br/>monophonic Windows Wave File or Mac AIFF. This plugin requires a host<br/>program such as Sound Forge in order to use it. In other words, it<br/>will take a monophonic line in a sound recording and apply a pitch<br/>shifting to it to make it play in the selected scale. A much<br/>different animal than tuning tables in a synth.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Troubledoor &lt;troubledoor@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Every synth module has this feature (even software synths have<br/>this<br/>&gt; feature.</p></div>
