I was surprised to find that the<br/>&gt; &gt;latter sounds noticeably better (at least to me), even though the<br/>&gt; &gt;fifths have a greater error.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 152-equal supports many different linear temperaments (in the most<br/>&gt; general sense, where the period need not be 1 octave, but can be<br/>1/2<br/>&gt; octave, 1/3 octave, etc.). Thus I have advocated 152-equal (Gene&apos;s<br/>&gt; false comments on MMM notwithstanding) as a &quot;universal tuning&quot;<br/>&gt; encompassing many of the tonal systems than interest me most. Could<br/>&gt; you elaborate on what the differences are between the way your<br/>&gt; example is tuned in the two files in questions, and what you think<br/>&gt; might be hearing that makes you prefer one over the other?</p><p>Before doing that, I would just like to mention that my 152-ET<br/>example (using closest approximation to JI) demonstrates that it does<br/>an excellent job of it!</p><p>I think I prefer the 152-ET example with wide fifth (linear<br/>temperament with generator one degree more than its best fifth) to 22-<br/>ET because the 7-limit consonances are overall much better (very<br/>close to a local 7-limit minimax).  In particular, the ratios of 5<br/>have a much better effect, both harmonically and melodically (since<br/>the major thirds are no longer narrow).</p><p>So I think you&apos;re onto something good with 152.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I&apos;m not sure exactly what you mean but if you mean that a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; given &apos;error&apos; is less noticeable for more complex ratios and more<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; noticeable for simpler ratios,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; this seems to support the &apos;TOP&apos; idea<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; for tuning temperaments over the straight minimax-within-an-odd-<br/>limit<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; you seem to have advocated in the past.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You didn&apos;t respond. I&apos;d be interested to know your thoughts, since<br/>&gt; Dave Keenan has pooh-poohed the TOP idea (in a sense).</p><p>I haven&apos;t been following the TOP discussion, because:<br/>1) I saw something early on about tempering octaves (which idea<br/>doesn&apos;t appeal to me), and<br/>2) The discussion was rather lengthy, and I didn&apos;t have the time to<br/>follow it, because<br/>3) I&apos;ve been busy working on notation documentation.</p><p>Since I&apos;m not familiar with the details of TOP, I didn&apos;t comment.  If<br/>you&apos;re advocating a weighting of tempering error according to ratio<br/>complexity (with simpler ratios getting more weight), then I suppose<br/>I could go along with that in principle.</p><p>But even after after you&apos;ve worked it all out, an actual listening<br/>test may turn up things you hadn&apos;t taken into account.  For example,<br/>after listening to these examples many times, I eventually came to<br/>the conclusion that the &quot;best&quot; equal division between 31 and 72 is<br/>probably 46 (taking into account both harmonic and melodic effect<br/>relative to number of tones -- but only my opinion).</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=53778 href="#53778">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

I must have missed something . . . too busy . . .</p><p>&gt;The wide fifth would be<br/>&gt;somewhere in the range from 709.59c (for a just 4:5 at +9G) to<br/>&gt;~710.5c (for a just 5:6 at -8G).</p><p>This is the &quot;superpythagorean&quot; system, or &quot;superpyth&quot; for short, that<br/>you&apos;re referring to here. It can be derived from a 7-prime-limit<br/>system by &quot;tempering out&quot; 64/63 and 245/243 (1728/1715 can be<br/>substituted for either of these, it makes no difference). This brings<br/>the total dimensionality down from 4 to 2, where dimension 1 would be<br/>an equal temperament.</p><p>I&apos;ve used this system to a limited extent, especially the &quot;no-fives&quot;<br/>version of this system where only 64/63 needs to be &quot;tempered out&quot;.</p><p>But the main thrust of my 22-equal work has been in &quot;pajara&quot;. This<br/>can be obtained from a 7-prime-limit system by &quot;tempering out&quot; 64/63<br/>and 50/49 (225/224 can be substituted for either of these, it makes<br/>no difference). This also brings the total dimensionality down from 4<br/>to 2.</p><p>&quot;Superpyth&quot; may be a bit more accurate, or less damaging to<br/>concordance, than &quot;Pajara&quot; in most tuning strategies. But &quot;Pajara&quot; is<br/>simpler, as properly comparing the pairs (or triplets) of &quot;vanishing<br/>commas&quot; I cite above will reveal.</p><p>Or, if you prefer, look at the size (# of notes per octave) of the<br/>octave-repeating scales needed to support your favorite 7-prime-limit<br/>harmonic resources. For example, a 12-tone &quot;superpyth&quot; scale will<br/>only contain 1 approximate 4:5:6:7 chord. Meanwhile, a 12-<br/>tone &quot;pajara&quot; scale will contain either 5 or 6 approximate 4:5:6:7<br/>chords (depending on whether the scale is omnitetrachordal or<br/>distributionally even). You would need to go up to the 17-<br/>tone &quot;superpyth&quot; scale to get this many approximate 4:5:6:7 chords.<br/>So &quot;superpyth&quot; certainly looks like a significantly more complex<br/>system than &quot;pajara&quot; on this basis. To me, such complexity is a<br/>compositional hardship.</p><p>Let&apos;s include within our sights a 7-limit version of the system you<br/>discovered in 1974, now known as &quot;Miracle&quot; (225/224, 1029/1024 [or<br/>2401/2400] &quot;vanish&quot;), into our considerations. This gives us three<br/>different ways of bringing the dimensionality of the 7-prime-limit<br/>from 4 down to 2. There are 10 or 20 other such systems which are no<br/>worse than these three in terms of mistuning damage and complexity.<br/>In fact, my XH18 paper (which I&apos;m sending out tomorrow night)<br/>presents 28 such systems (I include even higher-mistuning systems,<br/>which can be very useful for some timbres).</p><p>(Plus a bonus system -- ennealimmal -- which, while almost twice as<br/>complex as Miracle in the 7-limit, is barely mistuned at all. In<br/>fact, ennealimmal&apos;s mistunings are smaller than those in the 5-<br/>limit &quot;schismic&quot; temperament advocated by Helmholtz and Eivind<br/>Groven -- systems that have been historically referred to as &quot;just&quot;.)</p><p>Speaking of which, I have to go finish the paper.</p><p>- He who is not here</p></div><h3><a id=53791 href="#53791">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

I recently dug up an old reference to the 13-limit Lemba mapping that I mentioned a while back, but it was buried at the end of a list of tunings in an old post on the tuning-math list, and no one noticed it at the time. When I originally found the 7-limit version of lemba, it was just &quot;Number 82&quot; in a list of 114 7-limit temperaments. Now it&apos;s turning into one of my favorite tuning systems.

I frequently have the feeling that some of these tunings are really great, after accidentally stumbling across some nice bit of harmonic progression or melodic inflection, but that the limitations of the 12-note keyboard prevent me from being able to use them fluently. Miracle[31], for instance, is really nice in theory, but just try to play with it on a standard keyboard!

G&quot;.  this means that this note<br/>is calculated as one &quot;5th&quot;, with no &quot;octaves&quot; or &quot;3rds&quot;.<br/>we saw above that a &quot;5th&quot; is defined as 711&amp;1/9 cents,<br/>so that is the cents-value of note 7 (&quot;G&quot;) in this scale.<br/>hence, as Herman said: &quot;essentially it&apos;s in a slightly<br/>retuned 12-ET with sharp fifths&quot;.</p><p>note 1 is &quot;1 -2 3 1 !

Thanks for the kind words. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; planning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to (and I have no doubt of success) make even better music,<br/>&gt; &gt; both<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kinds you&apos;ve heard and kinds you haven&apos;t from me.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ***Hi Paul,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, I wasn&apos;t implying *anything* about your *own* music<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; making<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here, although it struck me after writing my post that it<br/>could<br/>&gt; &gt; be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interpreted that way.  It was totally a *general* comment<br/>about<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theory &quot;vs.&quot; composing...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Joseph, I thought it appropriate that this thread (which I<br/>&gt; started<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; while you were away) has finally begun to swing back towards<br/>its<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; original topic about *making microtonal music*.
