In the<br/>stacked-fourths triad, the concordance of the fourths is enough to<br/>compensate for the discordance of the 9:16 minor seventh. The entire valley<br/>of chords where the outer interval is a perfect fifth is bluish (the blue<br/>stripe running from left to bottom), reflecting the great concordance of the<br/>perfect fifth (3:2). Slightly higher basins (light blue) are the<br/>first-inversion major (5:6:8) and second-inversion minor (15:20:24) triads,<br/>reflecting the fact that the minor sixth is not a highly concordant interval<br/>. . . . more later . . .</p></div><h3><a id=11596 href="#11596">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/18/2000 6:00:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 744.10]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In light of some recent discussions with Pierre and Margo, I<br/>&gt; thought it would be worthwhile going back to various ways of<br/>&gt; looking at triads, in anticipation of looking at larger<br/>&gt; collections of notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a complement to <a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/triads.jpg">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/triads.jpg</a>,<br/>&gt; which featured in our discussions in March, I&apos;ve created<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/enttriad.jpg">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/enttriad.jpg</a>.

I&apos;ve just spent hours reading<br/>the follow-ups to that post.  Too bad I missed them at<br/>the time! (You posted the Voronoi diagram just when I was<br/>arriving in California at the end of my long road trip.)</p><p>I think you&apos;re really on to something here - something that<br/>many of us have been searching for for quite some time,<br/>and that it merits much more subsequent research!</p><p>If you put together a coherent discussion of this with both<br/>text and graphics, I&apos;ll be happy to give it a home at the<br/>Sonic Arts website.
