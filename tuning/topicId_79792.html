In particular,<br/>&gt; we use changing overtone structure (different resonant filters)<br/>&gt; to communicate vowels. The ability to infer a single source<br/>&gt; with changing qualities (like different vowels) from rapidly-<br/>&gt; changing partial complexes produced in human vocalization is<br/>&gt; paramount to human survival. Therefore it may make sense that<br/>&gt; our hearing apparatus is programmed to dissect partial<br/>&gt; complexes containing *harmonic relationships*, since those are<br/>&gt; found in nature and especially in human speech. Subharmonic<br/>&gt; relationships (like those created in minor or utonal chords),<br/>&gt; on the other hand, are nowhere found in nature.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p>I find this line of thought fascinating. Humans as &quot;hackers&quot; of the<br/>psychoacoustic apparati in the brain. People somehow figured out how<br/>to hijack the entire process of auditory analysis and create emotions<br/>with it. Speech is a form of communication using this mechanism -<br/>perhaps in a thousand years, music will have emerged as an<br/>evolutionary successor to speech! Imagine people communicating<br/>happiness by singing major tetrads and such... And of course the<br/>concept of &quot;God&quot; would be expressed by singing a harmonic scale.</p><p>One thing I&apos;ve been thinking about a lot lately... something that<br/>still needs to be explained for me, and perhaps auditory scene<br/>analysis can account for this somehow: I feel that when we listen to a<br/>chord progression, even of just two chords, something fairly deep is<br/>happening. What is responsible for a V-I progression, for example,<br/>having the particular quality that it does? Why does fifths-based root<br/>movement sound so &quot;colorful&quot;, even ignoring cultural and psychological<br/>influences?</p><p>For a V-I, the V chord is contained in the overtone series of the I<br/>chord. Does that somehow indirectly lead to the &quot;mood&quot; of that<br/>particular chord progression? A V-I is a very forceful, &quot;forward&quot;<br/>sounding progression. A IV-I, on the other hand, is a more relaxed,<br/>&quot;settling down&quot; sounding progression. Does the fact that the<br/>fundamental of the IV is a subharmonic of the fundamental of the I for<br/>some reason give rise to that characteristic as part of this analysis?</p><p>Even more worrying is that the characteristic shown from root movement<br/>by fifths seems a bit arbitrary. Why isn&apos;t there some kind of<br/>dominant/subdominant relationship that is demonstrated with root<br/>movement by other intervals, such as a major third? I-IIImaj shows no<br/>characteristic resemblance that I can think of to I-V, and I-bVI shows<br/>no resemblance to I-IV. Continued root movement by fifths or fourths<br/>seems fairly coherent, even as more sharps and flats and such are<br/>added, but movement by major thirds is much, much more &quot;dissonant&quot;.<br/>Perhaps there&apos;s something special about the way the auditory system<br/>perceives root movement by fifths?</p><p>I think the paradigm of music as an emergent property of a more<br/>fundamental psychoacoustic analysis of sound is promising and seems to<br/>click on some deep level. I&apos;d be interested to see what explanations<br/>have been offered for the phenomena of chord progressions somehow<br/>giving rise to the sensations that they do... At least some<br/>fundamental explanation for how the psychoacoustic auditory system<br/>reacts when a set of overtones with one fundamental changes to a<br/>different set of overtones with a different fundamental (i.e. a chord<br/>change). Does it hear it as an &quot;object moving&quot;? Or a shape shift of<br/>some kind?</p><p>Maybe an even simpler question is, how does the auditory system react<br/>to a single note changing by a harmonic interval, like a monophonic,<br/>melodic jump by a perfect fifth? That would probably account for a lot<br/>of it.</p><p>It is also extremely interesting that different chord progressions can<br/>produce different feelings and sensations and such: I think this might<br/>be directly related to the way that language developed. Diphthongs and<br/>words are sort of like chord progressions. Plus, if you&apos;re in the<br/>right state of mind, different phonemes -DO- carry their own subtle<br/>&quot;feelings,&quot; just like chords do... Either way, I think there is a<br/>deeper, underlying pattern to a lot of elements of language, in which<br/>these subtle feelings produced by different sounds and words gave<br/>direct rise to the meanings of some of those words (or perhaps in<br/>reverse order).

There<br/>are peaks and such at different harmonic intervals, and the graph<br/>produced wasn&apos;t too unlike the harmonic entropy curve - that is to<br/>say, it is easier for them to mode lock to oncoming input at<br/>low-integer frequency ratios.</p><p>&gt; People who are obsessed with spectra (which seems like<br/>&gt; everyone on this list these days) may propose that<br/>&gt; modulations of a fifth change the least amount of partials<br/>&gt; (other than the octave).

On the other hand, the bass<br/>note moving from C to G can have a much more dramatic effect, as can a<br/>C major triad moving to a G major triad. So while the relatively low<br/>harmonic entropy of a 3/2 might account somewhat for ear training<br/>students confusing a perfect fifth for an octave, I doubt even a<br/>beginning ear training student would confuse a C major triad moving to<br/>a G major triad with a C major triad moving up an octave. The thing<br/>that I don&apos;t understand is why the V chord &quot;contrasts&quot; so much from<br/>the I chord, or why major third-based root movement is so much<br/>dramatically more dissonant than fifths based root movement.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Diphthongs and words are sort of like chord progressions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hawaiian is a lot like chord progressions. :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p></div>
