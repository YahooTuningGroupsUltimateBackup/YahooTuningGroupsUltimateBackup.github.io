Lou&apos;s original idea was something like the followIng: a room would be filled with drawers, each containing a metallophone tuned to a particular mode.  The room would also contain tuneable harps or psalteries onto which one could transfer the tuning chosen.</p><p>What might such a room look and sound like? To a certain extent, a program like Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s _Scala_ and its extensive catalogue of scales serves this function, but I imagine that interface to the general public should be even friendlier.  The &quot;drawers&quot; could be graphic buttons on an html page, and opening each one would allow the viewer to read a description and history of the mode as well as hear the individual tones. Possibly samples of or links to real repertoire for the given mode might also be deposited in the drawer.</p><p>What kind of sampling format(s) would be best for such a project? Perhaps midi and mp3?</p><p>Does this idea interest anyone?</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/">http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/</a></p></div>
