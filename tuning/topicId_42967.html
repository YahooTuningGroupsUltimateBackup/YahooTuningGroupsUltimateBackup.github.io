What would justify<br/>&gt; 40/27 ?<br/>&gt; 40 &#xFFFD; 27 = 13 is not close to any sruti ;<br/>&gt; on the other hand, 81&#xFFFD; 64 = 17 is quite close to the<br/>&gt; &quot;commal RE&quot; 2nd sruti.<br/>&gt; I only think that to look at a schismic tuning with<br/>&gt; an &#xFFFD; indian &#xFFFD; ear is a good idea,<br/>&gt; as much as to look at the srutis with a &#xFFFD; western &#xFFFD;<br/>&gt; ear is a good idea too.<br/>&gt; Then two worlds can meet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; also, with a guitar, 81/64 is not far from a<br/>&gt; 24/19, something that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; can be easily arranged by a slight<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pressure on the right strings... do you know why<br/>&gt; I say that ?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; is it because a high-register 16:19:24 minor triad<br/>&gt; sounds great on a<br/>&gt; &gt; distorted guitar, due to the alignment of the<br/>&gt; difference tones around<br/>&gt; &gt; the fundamental 4 octaves below the root?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a good answer !
