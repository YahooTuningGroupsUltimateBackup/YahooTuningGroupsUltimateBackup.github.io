Results<br/>incontrovertibly manifest the delibarate employment of multifarious &iuml;&iquest;&half;middle<br/>second&iuml;&iquest;&half; intervals peculiar to the genre, yet, evaded by the current model.<br/>These &iuml;&iquest;&half;middle seconds&iuml;&iquest;&half; are roughly expressible as 2/3, 3/4, and 4/5 tones,<br/>and often referred to by the protagonists of the Music Reformation in<br/>T&iuml;&iquest;&half;rkiye during the early 20th century as &iuml;&iquest;&half;quarter-tones&iuml;&iquest;&half;. It is maintained<br/>that non-conformance arose, because the 24-tone Pythagorean theory in effect<br/>was specifically engendered by what may be properly named the<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;Yekta-Arel-Ezgi School&iuml;&iquest;&half; to ward off &iuml;&iquest;&half;quarter-tones&iuml;&iquest;&half; which allegedly<br/>affliated the Maqam Music heritage to Byzantine &amp; Arabs. In this paper, in<br/>order to effectuate the convergence of theory and practice, lower resolution<br/>temperaments where the octave is divided into 34 and 41 equal parts and<br/>middle to higher resolution temperaments where the octave is divided into<br/>46, 53, and 72 equal parts shall be scrutinized and furthermore, a 79-tone<br/>tuning created and implemented on a unique custom-made qanun by the author<br/>shall be explained. In the course of redeveloping a fixed-pitched Maqam<br/>Music theory, it is suggested that a low-resolution 34 or 41-tone equal<br/>temperament on the one hand, and a high-resolution 79-tone tuning on the<br/>other hand be adopted.</p><p>Why we say &iuml;&iquest;&half;Maqam Music&iuml;&iquest;&half;, What does the term &iuml;&iquest;&half;Turkish Maqam Music&iuml;&iquest;&half; mean?</p><p>First of all, at a conjuncture where we face expressions such as &iuml;&iquest;&half;Classical<br/>Turkish Music&iuml;&iquest;&half; (CTM), &iuml;&iquest;&half;Turkish Tasavvuf Music&iuml;&iquest;&half; (TTM), &iuml;&iquest;&half;Turkish Art Music&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>(TAM), &iuml;&iquest;&half;Traditional Turkish Art Music&iuml;&iquest;&half; (TTAM), &iuml;&iquest;&half;Turkish Folk Music&iuml;&iquest;&half; (TFM)<br/>and &iuml;&iquest;&half;Alla Turca&iuml;&iquest;&half;, each more cumbersome than the other, it is necessary to<br/>elucidate what we mean by the expression &iuml;&iquest;&half;Maqam Music&iuml;&iquest;&half;.</p><p>It must be confessed that our music community lingers on a medley of<br/>concepts. As someone who received Classical Western Music formation, I am<br/>concerned by the sight I behold. What we have here before us is a repertory<br/>notated on a single staff&iuml;&iquest;&half; lacking dynamics more often than not, prepared<br/>jejunely, with what instruments the scores shall be performed are not<br/>specified, there are almost no instrumental parts, no sign of<br/>instrumentation. Almost all the scores have been hastily notated in the near<br/>past. Moreover, it is not very clear which of the aforesaid categories the<br/>repertory falls into&iuml;&iquest;&half;</p><p>For example, let us take the Hijaz sharki by Hammamizade &iuml;&iquest;&half;smail Dede Efendi<br/>with the lyrics &quot;Ey b&iuml;&iquest;&half;t-i nev eda, olmu&iuml;&iquest;&half;am m&iuml;&iquest;&half;btela&quot;&iuml;&iquest;&half; Is this sharki, which<br/>bears the characteristics of 19th Century, CTM, TAM, or TTAM? Consider, if<br/>it were to be performed by an instrumental ensemble comprising ba&iuml;&iquest;&half;lama,<br/>kaval or kabak kemane also, what prevents them from being perceived as TFM?</p><p>Similarly, let us look at the following works with the given lyrics: Haf&iuml;&iquest;&half;z<br/>Post&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Rast &iuml;&iquest;&half;Gelse o &iuml;&iquest;&half;uh meclise, naz &iuml;&iquest;&half; tegaf&iuml;&iquest;&half;l eylese&iuml;&iquest;&half;, Tanburi Mustafa<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;avu&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Hisar-Buselik &iuml;&iquest;&half;D&iuml;&iquest;&half;k z&iuml;&iquest;&half;lf&iuml;&iquest;&half;n&iuml;&iquest;&half; meydana gel&iuml;&iquest;&half; or Yesari As&iuml;&iquest;&half;m Ersoy&iuml;&iquest;&half;s Hijaz<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;Yar sa&iuml;&iquest;&half;lar&iuml;&iquest;&half; l&iuml;&iquest;&half;le l&iuml;&iquest;&half;le&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half; Will they become CTM when the State Classical<br/>Turkish Music Choir performs them? Does a work acquire &iuml;&iquest;&half;artfulness&iuml;&iquest;&half; once it<br/>passes through the hands of TRT (Turkish Radio and Television Institution)<br/>that we call it &iuml;&iquest;&half;Art Music&iuml;&iquest;&half;? Or will they become TFM pieces in case the<br/>State Turkish Folk Music Ensemble renders them? Are not the listeners of<br/>these works &iuml;&iquest;&half;ordinary folk&iuml;&iquest;&half; already, that we establish a genre called Folk<br/>Music?</p><p>I believe these are well-placed questions. It strikes me that we were<br/>excessively hasty in branding styles/forms differing in the slightest withou<br/>t the least bit of change in the texture of music as genres.</p><p>Whereas, Western societies do not bother with such problems. The<br/>Classical-Contemporary genre, which encapsulates different performance<br/>styles and schools, is being transmitted to new generations via<br/>conservatories that (as the name implies) preserve the tradition, and<br/>evolves throughout history in an organic manner without severing its ties<br/>with the past. One may count every kind of performance tradition here, from<br/>violin or piano solos to gigantic symphony orchestras and choirs. In these<br/>performance traditions, twelve-tone equal temperament methodology dominates<br/>the scene due to the undisputed influence of the pianoforte since the past<br/>two hundred years.</p><p>Besides the Classical-Contemporary genre, regional and popular musics such<br/>as Blues, Jazz, Rock, Country, Hiphop (all of which use a similar tuning<br/>system and notation due to the delimiting prevalance of guitars and<br/>electronic keyboards) and ethnic musics coming from old Western colonies to<br/>Europe and Americas should be recalled. World Music and Fusion type<br/>syntheses are among these. As is well known, the ones most sought after are<br/>Indian and Arab (otherwise, &iuml;&iquest;&half;Oriental&iuml;&iquest;&half;) musics. So great is the curiosity of<br/>the West in regards to cultures foreign to its own, that &iuml;&iquest;&half;Gamelan<br/> Orchestras&iuml;&iquest;&half; unique to Indonesia are founded in the music departments of<br/>some universities.</p><p>Let us return to ourselves&iuml;&iquest;&half; It will be expedient to dissipate the confusion<br/>just a little. I adopt the &iuml;&iquest;&half;Maqam Music&iuml;&iquest;&half; nomenclature for this reason. The<br/>saying &iuml;&iquest;&half;Turkish Maqam Music&iuml;&iquest;&half; ought not imply different instrumental<br/>ensembles, performance styles and manners, but &iuml;&iquest;&half; just as with<br/>Classical-Contemporary Western Music &iuml;&iquest;&half; the repertory based on maqams which<br/>are more or less the equivalent of keys/modes. Thereby, when the &iuml;&iquest;&half;Turkish&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>prefix is omitted, we may consider the works also based on maqams/dastgahs<br/>by neighbouring nations under the umbrella of &iuml;&iquest;&half;Maqam Music&iuml;&iquest;&half; &iuml;&iquest;&half; just as is the<br/>case with Brahms, Shostakovitch, and Copland making Classical-Contemporary<br/>Western Music despite the fact that they belonged to different nations.<br/>Hence, Abd al-wahhab and Umm Kulthum become part of our multi-cultural<br/>identity. Moreover, it therefore becomes possible to evaluate our Armenian,<br/>Greek, and Jewish musicians outside of the scope of a Turkish nationalism<br/>that, from time to time, borders chauvanism.</p><p>As an additional reason why we do not say &iuml;&iquest;&half;Turkish Music&iuml;&iquest;&half; straightforwardly,<br/>we may offer the &iuml;&iquest;&half;Alla Turca&iuml;&iquest;&half;Alla Franca dichotomy&iuml;&iquest;&half; troubling us since<br/>eighty years. When we say Turkish Music, no music other than &iuml;&iquest;&half;the music made<br/>by Turks&iuml;&iquest;&half; is understood. Because no racial/ethnic distinction can be made<br/>between westernized modernist Turks and conservative Turks who uphold<br/>Eastern values, and because the East-West conflict still dominates a huge<br/>part of our lives, only saying &iuml;&iquest;&half;Turkish Music&iuml;&iquest;&half; does unfortunately nothing<br/>but confuse minds. How much of a Westen Music can &iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;kt&iuml;&iquest;&half;k a&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;k al&iuml;&iquest;&half;nla on<br/>y&iuml;&iquest;&half;lda her sava&iuml;&iquest;&half;tan&iuml;&iquest;&half; which incites the millions be regarded? This piece is<br/>not sung by Westerners, but our masses. What of the Popular musics that are<br/>in vogue since the 1950s? Such artists like Celal &iuml;&iquest;&half;nce? Erol B&iuml;&iquest;&half;y&iuml;&iquest;&half;kbur&iuml;&iquest;&half;?<br/>Erkin Koray? Cahit Berkay? Bar&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half; Man&iuml;&iquest;&half;o? In the end, all these artists have<br/>most certainly composed Turkish Music, be it &iuml;&iquest;&half;without maqams&iuml;&iquest;&half; the way we<br/>recognize them, or in Western fashion, since they are the outcome of our<br/>culture before all else, and are Turkish in origin.</p><p>To sum up, we dub &iuml;&iquest;&half;Turkish Maqam Music&iuml;&iquest;&half; the genre that necessitates a tuning<br/>which contains more tones compared to Classical Western Music, based on<br/>characteristic maqams, comprising many performance styles and manners,<br/>regularly performed on instruments such as tanbur, ud, kanun, kemen&iuml;&iquest;&half;e, ney,<br/>ba&iuml;&iquest;&half;lama, kaval and basically by people of Turkish origin or Turkophiles, and<br/>that which is mostly monophonic.</p><p>Search for a theoretical model compatible with practice</p><p>It has been established on the basis of frequency measurements and analyses,<br/>that the 24-tone Pythagorean tuning is not a model suitable to express all<br/>the intervals of Turkish Maqam Music and does not suffice to compensate<br/>practice contrary to what is claimed (Karaosmano&iuml;&iquest;&half;lu &amp; Akko&iuml;&iquest;&half;, 2003). It has<br/>been made manifest that characteristic middle second intervals representable<br/>by such superparticular ratios (based on the formula n+1/n) and roughly<br/>corresponding to 2/3, 3/4 and 4/5 whole-tone like 13:12, 12:11, 11:10 are<br/>particularly used in maqams such as U&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;ak, Saba, H&iuml;&iquest;&half;zzam, Karc&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;ar, and that<br/>these are not haphazard deviations (Yarman, et al., 2008).</p><p>During the &iuml;&iquest;&half;Music Reformation&iuml;&iquest;&half; period of 1920s and 30s (Pa&iuml;&iquest;&half;ac&iuml;&iquest;&half;, 1999), these<br/>intervals associated with Byzantine and Arabs and dubbed &iuml;&iquest;&half;quarter-tones&iuml;&iquest;&half; had<br/>been asserted as a pretext to reject &iuml;&iquest;&half;Alla Turca&iuml;&iquest;&half;. It is interesting that<br/>the controversial theory employed in practice and education today was formed<br/>just at a time when the tradition was under attack. The 24-tone Pythagorean<br/>tuning and theoretical model based on it, whose foundations were laid by<br/>Rauf Yekta, Saadettin Arel and Suphi Ezgi, seems to promote a &iuml;&iquest;&half;Turkish Maqam<br/>Music&iuml;&iquest;&half; bereft of &iuml;&iquest;&half;quarter-tones&iuml;&iquest;&half;, and thus, far from being regarded as<br/>Arabic or Byzantine origin, and in the end, not provoking the response of<br/>the &iuml;&iquest;&half;Music Reformation&iuml;&iquest;&half;. Consequently, non-conformance appears to have<br/>arisen due to the brushing aside of &iuml;&iquest;&half;quarter-tones&iuml;&iquest;&half; in concord with the<br/>rationale stated above (Yarman, 2008).</p><p>Recently, it is being debated how much sharper or flatter in terms of commas<br/>should the variable degrees of maqams which are not executed as they are<br/>notated be sounded compared to the theory based on the 24-tone Pythagorean<br/>tuning called &iuml;&iquest;&half;Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek&iuml;&iquest;&half; (AEU). This disposition is surely due to<br/>the need to express middle second intervals not specified in current theory.</p><p>Moreover, 32 or more frets from yegah to neva are affixed on tanburs today.<br/>In the same context, qanun-makers affix semi-tone mandals at logarithmically<br/>one twelveth of the octave by referring to tuners imported from the West,<br/>and divide the remaining length to the nut into six equal parts; in other<br/>words, they practically divide the octave into 72 equal parts without<br/>probably being aware of it. From this state of affairs, one may perceive<br/>that it is impossible for practice not to conflict with current theory.</p><p>That being the case, to assure that there is no discrepancy between what is<br/>written and what is performed, it is necessary to develop a new theoretical<br/>model along with a proprietary notation faithfully embracing executed<br/>intervals, or to reinterpret and revise the notation at hand.</p><p>Fixedness of pitch</p><p>In Turkish Maqam Music, just as there are those who say that one should<br/>never under any circumstances venture outside the boundaries of the 24<br/>Pythagorean perdes (tones), there are also those who set forth tenacious<br/>opinions such as that the perdes have no fixedness, and therefore may not be<br/>learned but &iuml;&iquest;&half;passed on by way of meshk (oral instruction)&iuml;&iquest;&half;.</p><p>It is not possible for us to agree with either of these arguments. For one<br/>thing, characteristic middle second intervals peculiar to certain maqams do<br/>not exist in the &iuml;&iquest;&half;Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek&iuml;&iquest;&half; system. In order to compensate for<br/>these, additional frets are fastened to tanburs and mandals affixed to<br/>qanuns. On the other hand, there will inevitably be mathematical<br/>relationships between pitches. For instance, we shall be able to say that<br/>the interval between rast-neva, d&iuml;&iquest;&half;gah-h&iuml;&iquest;&half;seyni, and segah-evc will always be<br/>a fifth, be it pure or tempered.</p><p>Besides, qanun, tanbur and ney are &iuml;&iquest;&half;quantized instruments&iuml;&iquest;&half;, and in the very<br/>least, the pitches of the qanun and the tanbur remain relatively static<br/>throughout performance. Even if we were to accept that ney perdes are very<br/>flexible, it should be feasible to satisfactorily approximate executed<br/>frequencies by a high resolution tone-grid.</p><p>In Western Music too do wind instruments and strings show deviations from<br/>12-tone equal temperament (tET), but this tuning is able to satisfactorily<br/>represent played frequencies. Furthermore, instrumental education is geared<br/>toward 12-tET which is originally intended for keyboard instruments. To<br/>discuss how useful and necessary it is to take fixedness of pitch as a basis<br/>in music education is redundant.</p><p>So, in order to lay the groundwork for a theory true to Turkish Maqam Music,<br/>it becomes a fundamental goal to incline towards a &iuml;&iquest;&half;microtonal fixedness of<br/>pitch&iuml;&iquest;&half; that shuns ambiguity but allows room for flexibility.</p><p>A selection of fixed-pitch settings for Maqam Music</p><p>In Turkish Maqam Music, amongst temperaments that equally divide the octave<br/>into logarithmic parts, we know of 53 and 72-tone equal temperaments. The<br/>first is being used since more than half a century as a theoretical tool to<br/>express how much sharper or flatter in terms of commas the variable degrees<br/>of maqams will be played (Aksoy, 1995). The latter is the elaborated version<br/>of the &iuml;&iquest;&half;12 equal semi-tones per octave methodology&iuml;&iquest;&half; that has come to be<br/>applied to qanuns due to interactions with Western Music. Both are very<br/>sturdy systems.</p><p>53-tET comprises the 24-tone Pythagorean tuning with maximum 1 cent absolute<br/>error. In any event, we insinuate it when explaining the theory in effect by<br/>saying that there are &iuml;&iquest;&half;9 commas in a whole-tone, 53 in an octave&iuml;&iquest;&half;. Above<br/>all, its indispensability in elucidating the 6 and 7 comma middle seconds<br/>peculiar to maqams such as U&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;ak, Saba, H&iuml;&iquest;&half;zzam and Karc&iuml;&iquest;&half;&iuml;&iquest;&half;ar is incontestable<br/>(Yarman, et al., 2008).</p><p>However, we see in qanuns another system, namely, 72-tET. Between these two<br/>tunings, there are differences at certain locations that amount to as much<br/>as half a comma. In 72-tET, more detail is present. If a higher resolution<br/>than 53-tET is desired, the advantages of dividing the octave into 72 equal<br/>parts becomes manifest.</p><p>Since we are soaring about so high numbers, I would like to mention a tuning<br/>I arrived at by dividing the octave into 159 parts and extracting from that<br/>79 tones, which I implemented on a qanun manufactured by Ejder G&iuml;&iquest;&half;le&iuml;&iquest;&half;. The<br/>features of this system, whose generator interval is 15.1 cents or 2/3 of a<br/>Holdrian comma, are:</p><p>1. That the main maqam is, as was the case in the past, Rast, as compared to<br/>the &iuml;&iquest;&half;argah of &iuml;&iquest;&half;Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek&iuml;&iquest;&half; which is defined as C Major (Levendo&iuml;&iquest;&half;lu,<br/>2003), and that the principal scale of this maqam is expressed as natural<br/>(non-accidented) notes on the staff.</p><p>2. That, in accordance with the international diapason   which comes along<br/>with the usage of Western staff notation, &iuml;&iquest;&half;S&iuml;&iquest;&half;p&iuml;&iquest;&half;rde Ahenk&iuml;&iquest;&half; (C key/diapason)<br/>is taken as basis where Rast scale more or less corresponds to the white<br/>keys of the pianoforte.</p><p>3. That the 3rd degree, which is segah, and the 7th degree, which is evc, of<br/>Rast are acquired without breaking the cycle of fifths utilized in the<br/>construction of the scale.</p><p>4. Again, via an uninterrupted cycle of fifths, that the 3rd and 7th degrees<br/>of the Rast scale are replaced by the higher perdes buselik and mahur, and<br/>therefore, modulation to Mahur is made possible.</p><p>5. That myriad &iuml;&iquest;&half;middle second&iuml;&iquest;&half; intervals seen in practice are positioned<br/>between such points as d&iuml;&iquest;&half;gah-segah, &iuml;&iquest;&half;argah-saba, and neva-hisar.</p><p>6. That such procedures are repeated at sharp and flat tones as easily as on<br/>natural tones, and that it becomes possible to transpose over to every ahenk<br/>(key/diapason) on the qanun.</p><p>7. That a 12-tone closed cycle is extracted for chromatic passages.</p><p>8. That there are no inconsistencies in notation and that accidental symbols<br/>are adequate for microtonal polyphony.</p><p>The 79-tone tuning is a most suitable theoretical device for the<br/>transposition of scales to any degree with a maximum deviation of 8 cents at<br/>every step.</p><p>In notating the 79-tone tuning, I adopted the &iuml;&iquest;&half;Sagittal Microtonal System&iuml;&iquest;&half;<br/>developed by George Secor and David Keenan (Secor &amp; Keenan, 2006). It is<br/>possible to express every comma nuance with only three additional microtonal<br/>accidentals alongside customary sharps and flats. These accidentals are:</p><p>1. Left barbs raising or lowering a pitch by 1 degree /|&amp;\!,</p><p>2. Right barbs raising or lowering a pitch by 2 degrees |\&amp;!/,</p><p>3. Double barbs raising or lowering a pitch by 3 degrees or a quarter-tone<br/>/|\&amp;\!/.</p><p>Accordingly, the (/|+|\ =/|\) formula always stands. Sharps and flats are<br/>always 6 degrees, double sharps and double flats are 12 degrees, and the<br/>tones in between are found by adding to or subtracting from these the<br/>microtonal accidentals of the Sagittal System. Notation is very much<br/>consistent.</p><p>We provide the 79-tone tuning and the traditional perdes collected in 17<br/>zones below (Table 1-not given).</p><p>But what about tanburs? No matter how long their necks are, the frets which<br/>can be fastened are limited in number. We ought to think of the ba&iuml;&iquest;&half;lamas as<br/>well. Under these circumstances, it might be necessary to focus on tunings<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half;less voluminous&iuml;&iquest;&half; compared to 53-tET. These are, from small to large,<br/>34-tET, 41-tET and 46-tET. Their generator intervals are 706, 702 and 704<br/>cent fifths respectively.</p><p>In 46-tET, just as with 53-tET, there are two kinds of middle seconds, and<br/>it is an attractive system. If, however, we partition the octave into 41<br/>equal parts, we can acquire the 24-tone Pythagorean tuning within tolerable<br/>limits and obtain at least one kind of middle second. 34-tET on the other<br/>hand, seems more compatible with the 17 traditional perdes outlook.</p><p>All of these are favourable for transpositions and polyphony. If asked that<br/>we choose one, 41-tET appears most ideal for tanburs. Ba&iuml;&iquest;&half;lamas and qanuns<br/>can too be manufactured in conformance to it. We can conceive theory and<br/>notation from the beginning accordingly (Table 2-not given).</p><p>Nevertheless, if we seek more detail, focusing on 72-tET and beyond is<br/>unavoidable. In academic studies, we shall preferably move up to the 79-tone<br/>tuning.</p><p>In that case, I suggest that we advance in two frontiers, choose either 34<br/>or 41-tone equal temperament for low resolution, and converge on the 79-tone<br/>tuning for high resolution.</p><p>--------------</p><p>References</p><p>Aksoy, B., (1995). &iuml;&iquest;&half;Makam&iuml;&iquest;&half;n Tan&iuml;&iquest;&half;m&iuml;&iquest;&half;na Do&iuml;&iquest;&half;ru&iuml;&iquest;&half;.

I understand that Arabs render maqam Segah<br/>with a quarter-tonal segah also (dismissing altogether the leading tone,<br/>which is perde kurdi), whereas we Turks execute segah of maqam Segah and<br/>Huzzam as it is sounded in Rast. However, perde segah is very fickle and its<br/>pitch varies depending on the maqam. In Turkish versions of Hijaz, Ushshaq,<br/>Beyati, Huseyni, Saba and Karjighar, segah is much lower.
