A couple of days ago I was experimenting with my cello. I had placed a split shot sinker  at various places along the legnth of the string.  When played pizz the string rings like a metalophone.  Sort of like Cage&apos;s prepared piano with the advantage of being able to alter the legnth of th string with my left hand. I got the idea about the split shot from Bart hopkin&apos;s book about building instruments. I cut my experiments short because I had just got new strings and I value their harmonicity.</p></div>
