I&apos;ll try to respond all at once:</p><p>Michael: it would be very interesting to investigate the use of<br/>31-equal for this. When you get up to 31-equal, you end up with a<br/>pretty fine coarse grid. The coarse grid basically has to do with<br/>long-term memory - for cents, you have the sound of 12 different<br/>signposts memorized, and then the &quot;fine grid,&quot; which isn&apos;t really a<br/>grid at all, is a formula to navigate you between signposts. For<br/>31-equal, you&apos;d have to memorize 31 different signposts. I&apos;m not<br/>ruling it out, but I wonder how hard that might be. It would be best<br/>to pick a tuning that is easy to sing.</p><p>It&apos;s also noteworthy, again, that the memorization of the full<br/>12-equal coarse grid is greatly facilitated by the fact that it is 7+5<br/>in meantone - you can just think of the diatonic scale, and<br/>intersperse one small step in between each of the large ones. So that<br/>might go a long way in helping people memorize the layout for<br/>31-equal, which they&apos;ll have to do whether people use it to replace<br/>&quot;cents&quot; or not.</p><p>To Jake: We will likely always stick with cents simply because of<br/>convention, but the reasons that I listed are, in my opinion, some of<br/>the underlying &quot;hidden conventions&quot; that go with the use of cents. We<br/>are, in fact, using it because it&apos;s based around 12-EDO, but the fact<br/>that 12-EDO happens to be a pretty stellar tuning also leads to the<br/>other properties mentioned. To pick another stellar tuning would<br/>likely lessen the impact of switching the system up, because it&apos;ll be<br/>intuitive enough that most of the vital features will still be met.<br/>Kind of like how Esperanto is designed to be maximally easy to learn<br/>because it builds on intuition.</p><p>Besides, this is all just for fun, anyway. It would be pretty useful<br/>if we, as experts, suddenly discovered that an easier and more<br/>intuitive system existed for describing the intonation of 13-limit<br/>ratios than cents. But yeah, for pedagogical purposes, cents are<br/>probably key.</p><p>To Mat Cooper: I say if you&apos;re going to use 72EDO you might as well<br/>just use 12, since the point of this is to keep the coarse grid as<br/>small as possible - ideally something you can sing. and round the<br/>cents off. But the use of 72EDO is sort of implicit in using 12,<br/>because you can just say that 11/8 is about 5 1/2 semitones or 550<br/>cents, or that 7/4 is about 9 2/3 semitones or 966 cents. Likewise, it<br/>might be useful to use 17-EDO as the coarse grid, since it easily<br/>gives you 34-EDO and 68-EDO - 68 being kind of like the 17-EDO based<br/>evil twin to 72-EDO.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Daniel Nielsen &#x3C;nielsed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2011 9:33:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I kind of like<br/>2^5 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 = 10080 (where each division is better than an 1/8 of a<br/>cent) instead of 2^4 * 3 * 5^2 = 1200.<br/>I dunno, 1200.0 seems fine to me (with a trailing decimal place).

I&apos;m definitely not trying to do that. I&apos;m just taking your analogy and running with it.</p><p>Also, my answer may have come off as flip, but I was just trying to be short. I don&apos;t mean to be disrespectful and I apologize if I came off that way.</p><p>In theory, Esperanto should be easy to learn and therefore should become a lingua franca; in practice, it is unrooted in any particular culture (except perhaps the subcultures of linguists and internationalists) and has, over the course of a century, barely gotten a foothold anywhere. By comparison, the incredibly unwieldy English language, grounded as it is in the particular culture and history of the Anglo-Saxons and their descendants, has several hundred million native speakers and (by some estimates) three times that number of non-native speakers.</p><p>This is not to say that some powerful people can&apos;t use Esperanto among themselves to great effect -- George Soros is a native speaker, since his father was a dedicated Esperantist -- but the language&apos;s theoretical benefits have not given rise to a significant population of speakers. It&apos;s likely that as many people speak Welsh as speak Esperanto, and Welsh is considered a threatened language that requires special support from the BBC and other cultural entities.</p><p>Abstract and theoretical arguments are great, as far as they go, but if you&apos;re talking about maximizing adoption rates, nothing beats sticking with a known entity and proven winner.</p><p>(This conversation reminds me of one of my favorite Yogi Berra quotes: &quot;In theory, there&apos;s no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is!&quot;)</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know where you see me saying not to use cents.</p><p>You didn&apos;t. But consider these two statements that are juxtaposed in your last post:</p><p>&gt; If we&apos;re dealing with novices getting into microtonality, we&apos;d use cents.<br/>&gt; If we&apos;re on tuning-math and talking amongst ourselves, maybe we&apos;d find<br/>&gt; it more useful to use 19-EDO or something.</p><p>Now let&apos;s consider mailing lists and interaction mechanisms for a moment (i.e., ignoring websites). We have the tuning list, the tuning-math list, the Xenharmonic Alliance on Facebook, and a few other cats and dogs. The tuning-math list is clearly not for novices (unless they also have a high degree of mathematical competence). But which of the others is for &quot;novices getting into microtonality&quot; vs. &quot;talking amongst ourselves&quot;?</p><p>Michael said:</p><p>&gt; I get the sense we&apos;re making a sweeping assumption musicians, even<br/>&gt; those not familiar with classical music, instinctively know cents.</p><p>Nope. I didn&apos;t know about cents until a year ago. I&apos;m making a sweeping assumption that musicians are familiar with 12-EDO. Based on that assumption, I&apos;m making an assertion (not an assumption) that the relation of cents to 12-EDO is a feature rather than a bug, because (for example) you can tell your brother that a semitone is 100 cents and he has an immediate understanding of how granular cents are.</p><p>Moreover, he has signposts related to what he already knows: If you told him that barbershop quartets use a 768-cent harmonic seventh a lot, he could, with little-to-no effort, see that this is significantly flat from the 12-EDO minor 7th he knows, but still closer to the m7 than to the M6.</p><p>Finally, if he looks around the Internet, almost everything he reads about tuning will be documented using ratios or cents.</p><p>&gt; Certainly it seemed to tell him nothing about how JI works or how to make new chords.</p><p>I&apos;ll bet. But are you asserting that a 258.3-31-EDO-unit semitone, or even the 998-31-EDO-unit major 3rd, *would* tell him how JI works or how to make new chords?</p><p>There&apos;s a lot of explanation that has to accompany those units in order to teach him those things, whether those units are 31-EDO or 12-EDO based.</p><p>&gt; In short, I think the main fault of cents is that it tempts people to<br/>&gt; simply find microtonal scales very like 12TET, rather than new ones...<br/>&gt; and the musical result is people tuning off 12TET to find more<br/>&gt; dissonance, rather than to find new chords.</p><p>Aren&apos;t you saying that people *should* be finding new chords instead of finding microtonal scales that are similar to 12TET? And isn&apos;t this imposing on people your view of what microtonality *should* be? ;)</p><p>I&apos;m currently quite happy to tune off 12TET to find new *consonances*, not new dissonances. 7/4, 13/11, 14/11, and 7/6 are all beautifully consonant, and while I know you like chords with lots and lots of notes, I tend to like triads. And I can do things with these consonances that I wouldn&apos;t do in 12-EDO: I don&apos;t care for the sound of C-Eb-F, but if you replace the Eb with a 7/6, I think it sounds pretty good.</p><p>Nothing wrong with that, right? Even though I&apos;m not deviating far from 12-EDO?</p><p>&gt; One key example of this: blues, where the quarter tones function for<br/>&gt; melodi/harmonic tension...but not much else.  To me it&apos;s like adding<br/>&gt; sugar to ice cream and calling it gelato...not quite true.</p><p>I love the blues. Its deviations from 12-EDO are significant enough that you can say &quot;he plays a great blues guitar&quot;, and millions of musicians and non-musicians alike, all over the world, will instantly know what you mean.</p><p>So you can say that the blues aren&apos;t microtonal enough for you, but when a musical style goes beyond 12-EDO to add melodic and harmonic tension (and sometimes to reduce it -- lots of blues players go for &quot;sweet&quot; sounds), and millions of people enjoy it, I&apos;d say microtonality is working.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p></div><h3>Steve Parker &#x3C;steve@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2011 8:49:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I disagree entirely.

The interval between 14/13 and 15/13 is obviously 15/14.  Ratios can tell you about relationships: an 11/10 is the interval between 5/4 and 11/8, or 12/11 and 6/5.  When the numbers are low, the relationships are obvious.  But in every JI system outside the overtone series, one encounters intervals occurring between intervals where the ratios are more complex and less transparent, and these have to be internalized before they can make sense.  A ratio that one has never encountered before, and whose factors are not immediately apparent, is obscure.  It&apos;s been a minute since I calculated the above ratios and already I cannot order them in size of largest to smallest without converting them to cents.

In dealing with temperaments, manipulation of cents values is often more sensible than dealing with approximate ratios, because you don&apos;t end up with error being multiplied.  So while ratios clearly have a place in musical thinking, cents are often more transparent in some important ways.</p><p>-Igs<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Steve Parker &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I disagree entirely.
