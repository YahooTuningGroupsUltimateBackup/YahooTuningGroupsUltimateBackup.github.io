It is in use, but the exactness of the pitch is lacking, due<br/>to influence of western 12tone ET on the one hand (on players and<br/>instrument makers), and lack of control/perception (of players mainly)<br/>on the other.</p><p>It goes like this:<br/>(x = semitone not used<br/> CAPITAL LETTERS show main note<br/> small letters show secondary note<br/> &quot;meri&quot; means dark tone-colour )</p><p>x<br/>ri<br/>x<br/>RI MERI<br/>CHI<br/>x<br/>RE<br/>x<br/>tsu<br/>x<br/>TSU MERI<br/>RO</p><p>Now, I&apos;ll show you the cent interval we generally use between each note:</p><p>100c<br/>x<br/>100c<br/>ri<br/>100c<br/>x<br/>125c<br/>RI MERI<br/>75c<br/>CHI<br/>125c<br/>x<br/>75c<br/>RE<br/>100c<br/>x<br/>100c<br/>tsu<br/>100c<br/>x<br/>125c<br/>TSU MERI<br/>75c<br/>RO</p><p>I have included pitch intervals even between the pitches I said we<br/>don&apos;t use, because they are used when we ... what do you call it ...<br/>move this scale up in pitch?</p><p>Linear typing is not so appropriate. Easier to draw it in a circle.<br/>but as I can&apos;t type in a circle, I&apos;ll give you one example, set out<br/>next to the above one:</p><p>(&quot;chi kari&quot; is starred so you notice it is 25c different from it&apos;s<br/>equivalent on the other set)</p><p>100c......100c<br/>x.........x<br/>100c......100c<br/>ri........RI<br/>100c......100c<br/>x.........x<br/>125c......100c<br/>RI MERI...*chi kari*<br/>75c.......100c<br/>CHI.......x<br/>125c......125c<br/>x.........U<br/>75c.......75c<br/>RE........RE<br/>100c......100c<br/>x.........x<br/>100c......100c<br/>tsu.......tsu<br/>100c......100c<br/>x.........x<br/>125c......120c<br/>TSU MERI..TSU MERI<br/>75c.......75c<br/>RO........RO</p><p>So that is 2 sets, but we actually use 4 such sets (transpositions?),<br/>or even rarely a 5th one. If you need I can write them too. But I<br/>think you get the idea?</p><p>So, the important pitch interval is the ones which are 75cents.<br/>Everything else, however, has been arbitrarily set around the 12 tone<br/>ET temperament. Thus the 125c interval, and all the 100c intervals.<br/>However, I think you guys must know what is better. For example, ro<br/>and chi have a definite relationship, as do ro and re. I am sure that<br/>for example the just intonation answer for the interval relationship<br/>connecting ro, re and chi would be better, or, anyway you guys must<br/>have good suggestions better than 12 tone ET.<br/>Firstly just for the 1st set what would be your suggestions?<br/>Then perhaps after that we could look into some kind of temperament<br/>which would be a &quot;best fit&quot; to cover all 4 common sets? (I can post<br/>more later).</p><p>Hope this can stimulate your interest!

I am not sure if there is a question there? Do you mean to<br/>ask me what scale I use? Apart from pointing to the scale as I<br/>described it in my first post, I would not know what to call it. As<br/>for whether is is pentatonic or not I don&apos;t know. I play it and study<br/>traditionally, which does not include any theory. We use 13 notes,<br/>which if you included 2 semitones we don&apos;t use, would make 15 notes to<br/>the octave. I have never seen them set out in sets like I did, but<br/>from my intuitive understanding of the music, it seems to me there is<br/>the basic set of 7 notes, 5 main notes (I guess that is pentatonic<br/>then?) with 2 (what I am calling) &quot;secondary&quot; notes, which play a<br/>lesser role. Then that set is transposed 4 or very rarely 5 times,<br/>thus we use altogether about 13 notes.</p><p> (My hunch being pentatonic because the note<br/>&gt; names sound Japanese, but the word that&apos;s supposed to mean &quot;dark&quot; is<br/>&gt; not in my [tiny] dictionary). Please answer in that other thread.</p><p>Ha ha. You got it! Actually I didn&apos;t want to mention where it was from<br/>because I didn&apos;t want to distract people away from an unbiased<br/>mind-view which would hopefully keep people more open to just logic<br/>and sound. Meri refers actually to a physical manÂœuvre used to create<br/>those notes. It doesn&apos;t mean dark. But those notes must be dark. For<br/>this music pitch and tone-colour are at least equally important.</p><p>It&apos;s sad that nowadays people are using western electronic tuners. We<br/>all know that the meri notes should be &quot;flat&quot;, but no-one even seems<br/>to think about all the other notes. Just blindly and unthinnkingly<br/>following 12toneET. So I thought I should try something with the help<br/>of you guys.</p><p>Justin</p></div><h3><a id=74265 href="#74265">ðŸ”—</a>justinasia &#x3C;justinasia@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2007 9:35:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It looks like you have two chains of fifths (or fourths).

One possibility<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; be to use 25/24 (70.672 cents) for the 75 cent interval, and 3/2 for<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fifths:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; ri = 1/1<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; RI MERI = 256/225<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; CHI = 32/27<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; RE = 4/3<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; tsu = 3/2<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; TSU MERI = 128/75<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; RO = 16/9<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Herman<br/>&gt; &gt; Like that, would RO and RE sound good together? And RO and CHI<br/>together?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, the interval between RE and RO is 4/3, and the interval between<br/>CHI<br/>&gt; and RO is 3/2. Any two adjacent notes in this chain will sound good<br/>&gt; together: tsu - ri - RE - RO - CHI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The closest scale in the Scala archive is ptolemy_diat4.scl,<br/>which is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; described as a &quot;permuted Ptolemy&apos;s diatonic&quot; scale.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you give me any cultural/historical background on the usage of<br/>&gt; &gt; that scale? Sounds interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not familiar with Ptolemy&apos;s work in music theory, but probably<br/>&gt; someone else here is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  The only difference<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; is that it has 8/7 and 12/7 instead of 256/225 and 128/75. The small<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; step is only 62.961 cents (28/27) in that version.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Another possibility if you want something closer to 75 cents for the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; small step is to use 25/22 for RI MERI and 75/44 for TSU MERI (the<br/>&gt; &gt; small<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; step works out to be 72.826 cents).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Actually the important steps for me to try to work out are the ones<br/>&gt; &gt; which have been so far using the 12 tone ET notes. The 75c intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; sound fine, and that is close enough. Also it is a bit of a personal<br/>&gt; &gt; taste thing here, different players using different intervals, or even<br/>&gt; &gt; different for different pieces, or simply just how you feel in that<br/>&gt; &gt; moment. But the other intervals, they are just set at 100c out of, I<br/>&gt; &gt; could say ignorance, or, convenience perhaps (use of western electric<br/>&gt; &gt; tuners).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I am open to all your suggestions. Also if someone would suggest what<br/>&gt; &gt; it would be in just intonation, I have a feeling that that could be<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, as you have given your answers in fractions, how may I<br/>&gt; &gt; understand these as cent intervals? For example, interval of &quot;ro&quot; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;tsu&quot;, &quot;ro&quot; to &quot;re&quot;, &quot;ro&quot; to &quot;chi&quot;, &quot;ro&quot; to &quot;ri&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The fractions are a convention for representing pitches in just<br/>&gt; intonation.

It is only the &quot;western note -25&quot; that we can<br/>hear so obviously is out of tune if set to the western value.

If that was wrong, sorry, I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know about writing it in fractions, as my tools deal with cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry for the confusion of which direction my scale was going as I<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t know the convention here, and I did already refer to you, in<br/>&gt; our private communication, to the mail which totally explains that and<br/>&gt; uses your names for the pitches also:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/74273">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/74273</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As the reader follows the sequence of intervals down the page, is<br/>&gt; &gt; this a list of intervals in ascending or descending pitch order?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please see link above<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If Justin really wants to do this the best way, I suggest making a<br/>&gt; &gt; recording of the pitches that he/she wishes to match, and attaching<br/>&gt; &gt; it to a private email or putting it somewhere as a url.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It would then be very easy to hear what he/she is attempting to<br/>&gt; &gt; achieve; either by ear or software analysis e.g. pitchtracking,<br/>&gt; &gt; Spear, or one of the more sophisticated applications which many &gt; of us<br/>&gt; &gt; use.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you follow the example given in the link above, and read the text,<br/>&gt; I think you will understand. I have all the equipment needed to<br/>&gt; measure pitch. That is not necessary. I am actually trying to find out<br/>&gt; what better pitches we could be using, as musicians. If it is not<br/>&gt; quite clear alreasy, please ask and I shall try to explain everything<br/>&gt; in one more concise and easily understandable mail.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again just I shall mention, it is not the pitch of the &quot;western note<br/>&gt; -25cent&quot; notes which I require help with. It is the notes which are<br/>&gt; currently at 12toneET values which I need help with. Because I know<br/>&gt; 12toneET is always out of tune, so surely can never be the correct<br/>&gt; choice for our music, and is only being used because it is &quot;close<br/>&gt; enough&quot; and people don&apos;t even question it, seeing as they don&apos;t even<br/>&gt; know it is out of tune. It is only the &quot;western note -25&quot; that we can<br/>&gt; hear so obviously is out of tune if set to the western value. The<br/>&gt; other notes are too subtle for these now western-music-saturated ears,<br/>&gt; so that is why I am turning to you guys, experts about pitch, for your<br/>&gt; knowledge.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you all very much<br/>&gt; Justin<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Charles Lucy lucy@...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ----- Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning -----<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For information on LucyTuning go to: <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; LucyTuned Lullabies (from around the world):<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Skype user = lucytune<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.myspace.com/lucytuning">http://www.myspace.com/lucytuning</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On 10 Nov 2007, at 12:29, justinasia wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;banaphshu&quot; &lt;kraiggrady@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hello justin:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just recently i was looking at a paper showing the actual tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; used<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the koto by a variety of prominent players which had &gt; intervals<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around the 75 cent size. looking at the fluctuation i tended to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hear.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this as possibly being close to a 24/23 which might seem &gt; unusual but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would put the difference tone a &quot;fifth&quot; (plus octaves)below &gt; the top<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; string.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you have the other intervals?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It makes sense they would use the 75cent interval. But it is &gt; the other<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intervals I want to establish. We agree on the 75cent interval. &gt; Even<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it doesn&apos;t need to be so exact. We can hear what it sounds good &gt; at.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; However, as for the other intervals, since they are not so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; outstandingly unique, all the koto players I know simply use &gt; electric<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tuners to tune their kotos. Doing that long enough, even if you &gt; tune<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it by ear your ear will be tuned to 12 tone ET, except of &gt; course for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; our specific 75cent intervals.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; However I think there should be a better, more musical way. &gt; That&apos;s why<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am posting here.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you do have the intervals those koto players used, and the &gt; notes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (except the 75 cent one) are not on 12 tone ET, that would be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting, if there is some consistency. Still, I think it &gt; must be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; quite a simple matter to one who knows about pitch, harmonics, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what notes sound good together. That&apos;s why I&apos;m posting on this &gt; list<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; here.

Seeing that I can&apos;t even find the little written information I must have, I can no more than give you a couple of vague pointers:</p><p>I&apos;ve heard about monks&apos; chants that the music moves inside a fixed fourth; that&apos;s 4/3, or 498 cents. But the tone (and here it fails me; maybe they use two tones within the frame interval) are any thing but stable or difficult to define, since it&apos;s mostly glides.</p><p>If you can find a sh&omacr; builder and ask how they tune their reeds and pipes, you&apos;ll get a definition of the fixed intervals in use in authentic Japanese terms. I, and probably others, would be very interested to learn about this, and a conversion to cents won&apos;t be a problem if the explanation is technical enough (hopefully).</p><p>If you play the koto, it is probably save to say (without any actual knowledge of the instrument) that the tuning proceeds by just fifths and fourths, because these intervals can be derived from the harmonics of the strings - except for the meri pitches. &quot;Pythagorean&quot; in Herman&apos;s posts simply means that these thirds and sevenths result from a chain of just fifths; Pythagoras is identified with restricting tuning mathematics to the numbers 2 and 3. The meri pitches may be derived by tempering the fifth (Herman&apos;s 705 cent; the problem is that the harmonic fifths can&apos;t be used for tuning), by extending the chain of fifths until you reach an approximation of the meri intervals that satisfies you, or by combining the two (a chain of 14 fifths gives you all the 15 notes you need for transpositions; its size is 696.4286 cents to hit the 75 cent meri interval. Since Herman&apos;s 705 cent solution is closer to the acoustic fifth, I&apos;d prefer it).</p><p>If you play the shakuhachi (which is really what I think you do), bear in mind that the sound of the note is also important. However you define the ideal sound of a meri note, the amount of bending you need probably depends on the instrument, weather, mood, whatever. Be flexible, and damn those pretuned strings and pipes :O).</p><p>As for &quot;polyphony&quot;, no. The Japanese music I know (i.e., popular traditional) is heterophonic, each instrument adding a little from its own resources, but all sticking to the same melody. In polyphony, they would purposefully keep out of each other&apos;s way.</p><p>Klaus</p></div><h3><a id=74311 href="#74311">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@polettipiano.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/2007 2:19:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Klaus Schmirler &lt;KSchmir@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pythagoras is identified with restricting<br/>&gt; tuning mathematics to the numbers 2 and 3.</p><p>Actually, not.

Yes, I am hoping to get all 4 sets<br/>&gt; playing equally. I&apos;m sorry I don&apos;t understand about the &quot;chain&quot;. But<br/>&gt; are you saying we can keep D, F, C, A and G the same as your original<br/>&gt; idea (first option in this post:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/74284">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/74284</a> ) even for<br/>&gt; all 4 sets? That sounds so good!</p><p>Yes, I think I understood correctly. Let&apos;s see if this works out the way you were expecting....</p><p>Start with D, G, A in the first set; if you want to tune so that the intervals D-G and D-A are beatless, you&apos;ll want to tune G to 498.045 cents above D (G - 1.955 cents), and A to 701.955 cents above D (A + 1.955 cents).</p><p>Now in the second set, the corresponding intervals are G-C and G-D. Since G is tuned to G - 1.955 cents, C should be tuned to C - 2.91 cents. Similarly, in the 3rd set, E is tuned to E + 2.91 cents. Then in the 4th set, which starts on C - 2.91 cents, to make the C-F interval beatless you need to tune F to F - 5.865 cents.</p><p>That gives you this set of pitches:</p><p>D         =  1/1  =   0.000<br/>E + 2.910 =  9/8  = 203.910<br/>F - 5.865 = 32/27 = 294.135<br/>G - 1.955 =  4/3  = 498.045<br/>A + 1.955 =  3/2  = 701.955<br/>C - 2.910 = 16/9  = 996.090</p><p>So these pitches will sound good with notes 1, 4, and 5 in all 4 sets. How about notes 3 and 7 in the first set? D-F is a very reasonable minor third -- a little smaller than the minor third in equal temperament, but this 32/27 is a commonly used interval and should fit this scale very nicely. 16/9 is fine for D-C. The one interval you might want to watch out for in this tuning is F-A; it&apos;s noticeably wider than the major third in equal temperament, which is already wide.</p><p>So if these notes are acceptable, the remaining notes in the 1st set are D#-25 and Bb-25. If those are tuned as 24/23 (73.681 cents or D#-26.319) and 36/23 (775.636 cents or Bb-24.394), then the interval between them is beatless.</p><p>The other pitches in the list are just the same 7 notes transposed to start on each of the 4 tonics (D, G, A, C).</p></div><h3><a id=74349 href="#74349">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2007 12:29:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Justin,</p><p>After doing some reading, and considering your question from many<br/>different angles, I conclude that the method of using a 12-equal<br/>electronic tuner and lowering some notes by 25 cents is probably well<br/>within the range of typical historical Koto and Shakuhachi tunings.</p><p>Considerations of just intonation, in the sense of beatlessness or<br/>slow beating or difference tones, would seem to be irrelevant since<br/>Koto/Shakuhachi music does not traditionally involve harmony.</p><p>If, as you say, the approximately 75 cent melodic interval is the<br/>essential thing here, then it needs no harmonic justification.</p><p>The Scala archive contains three files with Koto pentatonic scales,<br/>although they seem to have the wrong note as tonic.
