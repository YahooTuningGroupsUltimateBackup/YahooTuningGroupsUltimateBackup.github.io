I&apos;m not sure. Being newish to microtonality, I&apos;m still leaving open<br/>a lot of possibilities. One possibility is that EDOs are valuable as<br/>structures in their own right. On your recommendation, I bought Easley<br/>Blackwood&apos;s microtonal etudes. It comes with a very successful guitar<br/>suite in 15-EDO. Looking at the scale, I see good approximations only<br/>to 6/5, 13/9, and 5/3. How shall I explain the success of this suite<br/>if I assume that good music is made with just intervals?

You just said, &quot;with 31EDO...over 20 notes<br/>are near 9-odd-limit Just intervals.&quot; Should we privilege these 20<br/>notes over all others? Do we *have* to include the 3/2? (That seems<br/>so... So... Well, so 3-limit, you know? People should learn to break<br/>the hegemony of the fifth.) Where&apos;s my 13/11 minor third? And what<br/>about the 33% of the notes that are *not* near just intervals? Should<br/>we privilege these inharmonicities above all others? The bottom line<br/>is, I think you want to *break* people from the habit of looking to<br/>the measurement system for guidance about what &quot;sounds good&quot;, and you<br/>can&apos;t do that when you&apos;re specifically designing your unit of measure<br/>to guide them to tones you think are particularly harmonic.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p><p>On 6/26/11, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Jake&gt;&quot;The farther away your notes/dyads/etc. are from 100-cent boundaries,<br/>&gt; the less you&apos;ll sound like 12-tET.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn&apos;t say that necessary holds as a rule...<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; You could have a scale of 50,150, 250,350,450,550...1150...or<br/>&gt; 25,125,225....1125 cents...and the only thing different would be the chords<br/>&gt; containing 0 cents and octave equivalents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; I think the very bane of the &quot;cent&quot; system is that is weighs things so far<br/>&gt; as closeness to 12EDO, rather than closeness to Just intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; 19EDO cents, even...would, in general, be a large step up from 12EDO cents<br/>&gt; far as accurately approximating Just intervals for most steps in the<br/>&gt; tuning...even if you don&apos;t like my idea of using 31EDO to get &quot;virtually<br/>&gt; every 11-or-less odd-limit&quot; Just interval possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;Any system will have arbitrary aspects.&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Granted.&nbsp; But what&apos;s more important: closeness to 12EDO or closeness to<br/>&gt; Just intervals?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; Personally I&apos;d say it&apos;s closeness to Just Intervals...and 12 EDO does<br/>&gt; quite a poor-man&apos;s approximation of Just Intervals.&nbsp; And if you take the<br/>&gt; number of intervals in 12TET quite close to Just intervals, you only get<br/>&gt; about 4 intervals (and that&apos;s optimistically assuming you want the 16/9<br/>&gt; instead of a 7/4 or 9/5!)&nbsp;&nbsp; With 19EDO, your get more like 10 low-odd-limit<br/>&gt; (9-limit or less) intervals within 8 cents or less error: 58% more notes,<br/>&gt; but over 100% more near-Just notes.&nbsp; And with 31EDO...over 20 notes are near<br/>&gt; 9-odd-limit Just intervals.&nbsp; So the chance of your hitting a note with a<br/>&gt; precise Just-interval musical meaning is much higher.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/27/2011 8:12:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The choice of the  cent as the base of a system of musical &gt;logarithms has<br/>&gt; been highly approved by  all musicians interested in the scientific side of<br/>&gt; their art.
