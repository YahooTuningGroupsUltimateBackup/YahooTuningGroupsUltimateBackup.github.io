Although not too many of these people actu-ally do come,<br/>but<br/>such people can always be found. I myself have recently written a<br/>piece for the ANS with the title Tryptich-Ocean, which was performed<br/>at the Moscow Autumn Festival and at the Electro-nic Music Festival<br/>in<br/>Bourges in 1996. It presents three sound-pictures of the oceans. The<br/>first of these is called Waves, Winds and Birds, the second -<br/>Tam-tams<br/>of the Green Island, and the third - The Game of Dolphins. The entire<br/>composition utilizes the sonorities of the ANS as well as variety of<br/>natu-ral, concrete sounds - waves, sounds of dolphins and African<br/>drums. The ANS is also regularly used in an electronic and computer<br/>music course, taught by composer Victor Ulyanich at the Gnessin<br/>Russian Music Academy. His students come to my laboratory at Moscow<br/>University and work on the ANS in practice. Every year two or three<br/>students, composers of the fourth course of the Academy, write<br/>elec-tronic pieces at the end of the second semester as final<br/>projects<br/>for the course. One student, a girl from Vietnam, wrote a piece with<br/>the title In a Buddhist Temple. Another graduate of the Musical<br/>Academy, Ludmila Mechova, wrote a piece for the ANS and saxophone.<br/>Except for a few of such pieces of a larger scope, most people write<br/>small pieces, such as etudes or elec-tronic preludes, their main<br/>intent being to show their technical mastery of the ANS. I myself<br/>have<br/>re-cently used the ANS in a recent composition of mine, which has<br/>recently been performed at the Mos-cow Autumn music festival, which<br/>is<br/>titled The Birth of the Vertical. I decided to give it this name,<br/>be-cause I was really impressed by a painting of a famous Moscow<br/>painter of Spanish origin, Francisco In-fante, carrying this title,<br/>which I saw three years ago at an exhibition in a gallery where there<br/>was an ex-hibition of paintings from the 1960&apos;s. I was very much<br/>inspired by his painting and the whole concept and idea itself of The<br/>Birth of the Vertical, so I decided to realize this idea in sounds. I<br/>used the ANS for that - it sounded in a generous doze along with<br/>other<br/>electronic and computer-generated sounds. There were also some<br/>concrete sounds, so what turned out was a distinctive conglomeration<br/>of all of these musical means. Lately I have switched almost entirely<br/>to computer musical technology. Two of my latest compositions: Music<br/>for Wood and Metal and Confession, which consisted entirely of<br/>con-crete sounds, recorded with a microphone, nevertheless all<br/>underwent electronic elaboration on the computer, such as<br/>transformation of sound and piling of musical layers one on top of<br/>the<br/>other - this was done with the help of special computer music<br/>programs, such as DART (Digital Audio Restoration Technology), Sound<br/>Forge and SAW (Software Audio Workshop). I am continuing to work<br/>intensively in this direction.</p><p>Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia, translated by the<br/>interviewer.</p></div>
