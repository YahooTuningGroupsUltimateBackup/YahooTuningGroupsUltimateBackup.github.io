I do not recollect that the synonimity between &quot;octave&quot;<br/>and &quot;doubling of register&quot; has been mentioned in Bharat<br/>Muni&apos;s &quot;Natyashastra&quot; or Sharngdeva&apos;s &quot;Sangitaratnakara&quot;.  Since the<br/>terms used for notes designated &apos;graha&apos;, &apos;amsa&apos;, &apos;nyasa swara&apos; etc.<br/>are not used anymore in Hindustani music, we probably may have to<br/>revive the study of those notes, to see if they were sub-tonal<br/>centers in a raga, in addition to the Sa.  Same applies to &apos;vadi&apos;<br/>and &apos;samvadi&apos;.  In other words, we want to find out if something akin<br/>to re-distribution of intervals (called &apos;graha-bhedam&apos;/graha-swara-<br/>bhedam&apos;/&apos;shruti-bhedam&apos;) took place.  It is only then that we can<br/>study if &apos;octave&apos; had always meant 2:1.  Also, it is only then that<br/>we can study if we had cases of &quot;extended references&quot; in Indian<br/>music.</p><p>Historically, there was folk music before there was classical music.<br/>And folk music has always been replete with shruti-s, kaku, alankara-<br/>s, gamak-s and staya-s.  [We will deal with these, later].  On the<br/>other hand, the classical music formally developed with one tone,<br/>then two tones, then three tones, and so on ,till we had seven tones<br/>at a late Vedic period.<br/>The question: in Indian music, when did OCTAVE = 2:1 happen?  Or, did<br/>it?</p><p>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=18508 href="#18508">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>2/9/2001 3:44:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A standing ovation for Haresh is in order!</p><p>Thanks for this Haresh!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; SHRUTI: The Indian Imbroglio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Leap of Faith<br/>&gt; -----------------<br/>&gt; Zuckerkandl: For what is musically right, musically wrong, the<br/>court<br/>&gt; of last resort is the ear of the musician, not the physicist&apos;s<br/>&gt; apparatus.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Euler: Can one lock up an art, like music, in laws?

The role of<br/>intonation in harmonic consonance is indeed important, but the degree<br/>of theoretical attention that has been focused on it is also due to<br/>the fact that intonation&apos;s other roles (key coloration, melodic<br/>meaning) are far more difficult to theorize about.&quot;</p><p>My note: Study of shruti should, among other things, explain the<br/>melodic meaning of intonation.</p><p>SHRUTI: The &quot;Dynamic Intonation&quot; in Indian music<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>Shruti -- the &quot;Dynamic Intonation&quot; --  is the way frequencies are<br/>assigned to shruti-s in the performance of a raga. It must operate<br/>within flexible parameters that guarantee that the basic significance<br/>and aesthetics of a raga will be preserved.  While the term &quot;dynamic<br/>intonation&quot; has a different meaning in the context of Western music,<br/>I borrowed the term as it represents the concept of shruti better<br/>than the word &apos;microtone&apos;.  This is, till somebody finds a still<br/>better term for shruti.</p><p>Language and Music<br/>------------------</p><p>The notion that there are kshetra-s (fields) in which the &grave;kshetrgya&apos;<br/>(operators) function, is not applicable to mathematics alone. It is a<br/>generic epistemic notion which can be interpreted for any type of<br/>particulars. What is the meaning of &grave;field&apos; here? What does it refer<br/>to? Whatever it refers to, it is in a similar sense that the term has<br/>been used in Samkhya philosophy. In communication and transfer of<br/>information within the field it was discovered that operations (meta-<br/>rules) yielded determinate results, such as propositions or<br/>statements, as well as indeterminate results, such as &grave;dhatus&apos;, the<br/>simplest elements of propositions. As for music within the field, it<br/>was discovered that there were determinable shruti-s, &grave;swara-s&apos;, as<br/>well as indeterminate &grave;shruti-s&apos;, on which operations had to be<br/>performed to yield &grave;raga-s&apos;. It must be noted that these discoveries<br/>were not a priori, but empirical. The numerous phonetic elements with<br/>which texts of Sanskrit grammar, such as &quot;Siddhantakaumudi&quot;, begins<br/>were discovered after close scrutiny of language. Similarly, the<br/>Natyashastra describes experiments with numerous &grave;vinas&apos; with diverse<br/>lengths of strings to determine the smallest difference in pitch and<br/>thus to determine the shruti-s.</p><p>In linguistics the most significant development arose from the<br/>realisation that momentary syllablisation of sounds have the property<br/>of adding into phonetically and semantically meaningful utterances.<br/>The natural question to arise was: what are the simplest phonetic and<br/>semantic elements, and how does the process of addition of (the being<br/>of) these simplest elements take place to become meaningful<br/>propositions? The &grave;siksha&apos; and &grave;pratishakhya&apos; class of literature<br/>deal with the theoretical aspects of utterances. As for semantics,<br/>the central problem, such as in Bharatrihari&apos;s &quot;Vakyapadeeyam&quot;, is<br/>not how propositions become true, but how a series of sound patterns<br/>add up in time to become meaningful. The situation in music is<br/>similar: how do the simplest elements of sound, shruti-s, add up in<br/>time to produce &grave;rasa&apos; (emotions)? Rig Pratishakhya deals elaborately<br/>with the meta-rules, &grave;paribhasha&apos;, of how utterances are joined<br/>together to yield meaningful results. Bharatmuni&apos;s &quot;Natyashastra&quot; and<br/>Sarangadeva&apos;s &quot;Sangitaratnakara&quot;, among other musicological texts,<br/>deal elaborately with the question of appropriateness of meta-rules<br/>to &apos;join&apos; shruti-s together so as to yield melodies.</p><p>In &grave;Pindotapattiprakarana&apos; (2.2) chapter of &quot;Sangitaratnakara&quot;,<br/>Sharngadeva establishes a direct relation between the semantic meta-<br/>rules of language and music. In musical terminology the &grave;field&apos; is<br/>referred to as &grave;nada-brahman&apos;; Sharngadeva states in this section<br/>that language and music are the results of the operations of<br/>different operational meta-rules on the same &grave;nada-brahman&apos;, hence<br/>their foundations must be similar.  Rig Pratishakhya has three<br/>classes of meta-rules (&grave;paribhashasutra-s&apos;) applicable to language,<br/>(a) &grave;samanya-sutra&apos; (universal rules), (b) &grave;apavada-sutra&apos; (rules for<br/>exceptions), and (c) &grave;nipatana-sutra&apos; (counter-rules).</p><p>There are six major aspects of intonation in American English:<br/>(1) New Information (2) Contrast (3) Meaning (4) Pronunciation (5)<br/>Mood or Personality (6) Cultural Understanding.  Their similarities<br/>with the question of intonation in music is quite apparent.</p><p>The study of [the language of] Indian music involves: alankara-s<br/>(&quot;Sangitaratnakara&quot; Chapter I), sthaaya (&quot;Sangitaratnakara&quot; Chapter<br/>II, which includes &apos;kaku&apos;), and gamaka-s (&quot;Sangitaratnakara&quot; Chapter<br/>II).  Without these, perhaps the only singing possible is that of the<br/>thaat-s, which are never performed on the stage.</p><p>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=18521 href="#18521">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>2/10/2001 7:28:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; SHRUTI: The Indian Imbroglio II<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Derth of study of Melody<br/>&gt; --------------------------<br/>&gt; Paul Hindesmith: It is an astonishing fact that instruction in<br/>&gt; composition has never developed a theory of melody.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Henry Lang: A study of melody construction is almost unknown.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Even if dissonance and consonance were completely understood, they<br/>&gt; are fundamentally harmonic phenomenon, so an important extension to<br/>&gt; the tuning theory would be the consideration of melodic criteria.&quot;<br/>&gt; Ben Denckla.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the degree<br/>&gt; of theoretical attention that has been focused on it is also due to<br/>&gt; the fact that intonation&apos;s other roles (key coloration, melodic<br/>&gt; meaning) are far more difficult to theorize about.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My note: Study of shruti should, among other things, explain the<br/>&gt; melodic meaning of intonation.</p><p>Haresh,</p><p>Hello!

This is, till somebody finds a still<br/>&gt; better term for shruti.</p><p>I think it is an entirely appropriate term, because it is what one<br/>does to adapt to the context of a real world music scenario. Very<br/>little about the experience of actual music making, performing or<br/>composing full compositions, will be revealed under the microscopes<br/>of abstract theoretical analysis. Complex sound structures which<br/>evolve over time, defy this, and create their own order and logic. It<br/>is an ever shifting phenomenon where the rules of the game change<br/>drastically dependent upon context. There may be general rules of<br/>thumb, but I&apos;ve seen and heard these very rules defied by the musical<br/>context and choice of timbres used in the music. Much of what is said<br/>about harmonic theory in this forum has minimal value to my music,<br/>because of the reality of the context of my own music deals with much<br/>use of inharmonic timbres, and Melody reigns supreme for me. I&apos;m not<br/>usually thinking about playing a 5 note chord on a metallophone<br/>instrument, but seek to play something which is melodically and<br/>stylistically appropriate to the timbres and musical context under<br/>consideration.</p><p>One reality exists in the laboratory of dyadic analysis, but when the<br/>theorist must roll up the sleeves of his lab coat, and actually<br/>compose a compelling piece of music, which will inspire repeated<br/>listening, then a whole new set of challenges reveals itself, which<br/>were just too big and bulky to fit under the microscope. A feeling of<br/>vertigo overwhelms him and he retires for a coffee break.</p><p>The truth is that, many times abstract theoretical work is like a big<br/>water hose, continuously spewing forth an impressive shower of<br/>abstract concepts and numerological fantasies; and such a profusion<br/>of this can come forward as to dwarf, or minimize efforts toward the<br/>final goal and ultimate verification in the form of living, breathing<br/>and evolving *MUSIC*.  This will likely never be explained by pure<br/>mathematical means, since it is an activity filled with<br/>mathematically unquantifiable phenomenon and human emotions.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Language and Music<br/>&gt; ------------------<br/>&gt; The situation in music is<br/>&gt; similar: how do the simplest elements of sound, shruti-s, add up in<br/>&gt; time to produce &grave;rasa&apos; (emotions)?

And that the emotional<br/>quality evoked by the simplest elements is an important facet of the<br/>music, shows quite a divining line between an approach which is<br/>totally mathematical, and removed from the realities of actual music<br/>creation. Emotions are an uncomfortable reality for the abstract<br/>mathematical theorist, yet the control over them is of supreme<br/>importance to the musican/composer.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; In &grave;Pindotapattiprakarana&apos; (2.2) chapter of &quot;Sangitaratnakara&quot;,<br/>&gt; Sharngadeva establishes a direct relation between the semantic meta-<br/>&gt; rules of language and music.

Please bring forth more about<br/>Indian melodic concepts. It is a fresh drink of water in a desert of<br/>Dyads.</p><p>Melody is the primal vertebrae of all music. We never hear of people<br/>going around humming or whistling the chord progressions in music. It<br/>is the melodic line that commits to memory, and therefore it will<br/>always and forever reign supreme. This is why it will always remain<br/>the most exciting facet of microtonal music creation. That good<br/>melody defies the logic of the abstract theoretician, and is<br/>dependent upon musical context, is all the more reason to begin to<br/>focus on it more in our music and tuning research, and discover the<br/>wonder and mystery of unchained music creation outside the wish<br/>fulfillment fantasies of the mathematician/abstract theorist. What<br/>may be true in the lab, is abstract meaninglessness until proven in<br/>the musical context of composition, performance and recording.<br/>Anything else remains frozen, unverified and only audible in the<br/>speech of the theorist voice.</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>By The General Rules of Thumb, Something Wicked This Way Comes.</p><p>}:  )</p></div><h3><a id=18525 href="#18525">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/10/2001 8:48:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18503.html#18521">/tuning/topicId_18503.html#18521</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; SHRUTI: The Indian Imbroglio II<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Derth of study of Melody<br/>&gt; &gt; --------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul Hindesmith: It is an astonishing fact that instruction in<br/>&gt; &gt; composition has never developed a theory of melody.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul Henry Lang: A study of melody construction is almost unknown.<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haresh,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello!

Of course, when notables<br/>like Hindemith and Paul Henry Lang make statements, people have a<br/>tendency to listen.

This includes, MUCH,<br/>material on melodic construction.  In fact, the first book of the two<br/>volume set [Wadsworth Publishing Company, Belmont CA] almost entirely<br/>deals with melody, so clearly Siegmeister, and many others, found it<br/>&quot;underrated&quot; in Western music.</p><p>I&apos;m not meaning to imply that the statement that harmony is<br/>predominant in the West is incorrect... only that a good number of<br/>people have been well aware of this for some time and have taken<br/>significant steps to remedy it...  And, for another thing, it is a<br/>&quot;new&quot; tack to composition... since harmony has been so emphasized.<br/>Composers have been thinking about melody and ALSO about &quot;world music<br/>melody&quot; in their music for some time now.  Lou Harrison comes<br/>immediately to mind, but there are many many others...  And these are<br/>PRIMARILY &quot;Western&quot; composers, although they use pluralistic elements.</p><p>&gt; The truth is that, many times abstract theoretical work is like a<br/>big water hose, continuously spewing forth an impressive shower of<br/>&gt; abstract concepts and numerological fantasies; and such a profusion<br/>&gt; of this can come forward as to dwarf, or minimize efforts toward<br/>the final goal and ultimate verification in the form of living,<br/>breathing and evolving *MUSIC*.  This will likely never be explained<br/>by pure mathematical means, since it is an activity filled with<br/>mathematically unquantifiable phenomenon and human emotions.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I appreciate your sentiments here, Jacky, and I essentially agree<br/>with them, but what I don&apos;t really want to see is a kind of &quot;us<br/>against them&quot; mentality evolving here.  There are so many different<br/>approaches to music right on this very list, that I wouldn&apos;t want to<br/>try to definitively determine the significance of any one person&apos;s<br/>(or two people, for that matter!) orientation.</p><p>As for me, I am fascinated by some of the abstract concepts because<br/>most of them eventually lead to SCALES.  Let&apos;s face it... that&apos;s<br/>usually what it&apos;s all about.  Even Dan Stearns (Hi Dan!) usually ends<br/>up with various sets of frequencies that could finally make a scale...</p><p>Then, composers can use this material and, hopefully,  come up with<br/>something, but I am certainly glad that such investigations are<br/>taking place.  In fact, I know, Jacky that you, yourself undertake<br/>such rigorous scale investigation procedures...so, really, there<br/>shouldn&apos;t be any kind of &quot;dichotomy&quot; only, as Margo Schulter usually<br/>wisely says, a &quot;plurality.&quot;</p><p>None of the above, Jacky, is in any way a &quot;criticism...&quot;  Only a<br/>couple of observations that I hope that you and possibly somebody<br/>else, might find of interest...</p><p>_________ ______ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=18529 href="#18529">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>2/10/2001 9:52:53 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello Jacky and Haresh!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for this interesting material.

As those of you who have been on the list<br/>for a while will know, in my search for &quot;generalizations&quot; of the diatonic scale, I first look at a scale to<br/>see if it looks useful from a melodic point of view. If so, it automatically becomes an interesting<br/>scale to me. Then, lower in importance, are the scale&apos;s harmonic properties, and lower still, its<br/>tonal properties. But I don&apos;t usually bother to check those out if the melodic properties don&apos;t look<br/>good or at least interesting -- since I feel melody comes first. So yes, I feel Jacky is making a<br/>false dichotomy, particularly if he puts me on the other side from himself.</p><p>Nonetheless, I&apos;d be surprised if even Jacky is not aurally enchanted after a few hours playing<br/>with the Keenan/Wilson tumbling dekany, despite the fact that it is completely amelodic (or, one<br/>might say, the melody is completely incidental and accidental, much the way harmony is in many<br/>melodically-oriented cultures). The field of microtonality is so wide open right now that there is<br/>much to be gained from a plurality of approaches -- melodic and harmonic, intuitive and<br/>mathematical, etc. . . . I will continue to speak out against numerology, particularly where I feel it<br/>amounts to potentially misleading pseudo-science, but far more important to me is that we all<br/>work toward the goal of making more microtonal music to be listened to, cross-pollinate one<br/>another&apos;s ideas, and ultimately lead to an overthrow of the 12-tET prison that is stifling our culture<br/>:)</p><p>By the way, Jacky, Dave Keenan is now officially a composer -- so I think we would all<br/>appreciate it if you chilled out with your evocations of lab coats and other implications of<br/>villainous &quot;anti-musicians&quot; on this list . . . the divisiveness clearly serves the interests of music<br/>even less than publishing lists of 6-digit prime numbers . . . ;)</p></div><h3><a id=18550 href="#18550">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/10/2001 2:27:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., PERLICH@A... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18503.html#18545">/tuning/topicId_18503.html#18545</a></p><p>evocations of lab coats and other implications of<br/>&gt; villainous &quot;anti-musicians&quot; on this list ;)</p><p>That&apos;s very funny.

We&apos;ve got a real &quot;4&quot; fetish in our culture,<br/>which goes hand in hand with the 12 tone ET scale (the Evil Twins of<br/>Western Music).</p><p>I&apos;m making it a personal musical goal to explore just about anything<br/>outside of 4 these days too. I just love the challenge of writing<br/>melodic parts and harmonic themes in cycles other than 4. It opens a<br/>whole new phrasing logic.</p><p>Furthermore, I&apos;ve been actively using prime polymeters in my music<br/>for years, where many musical parts and singing voices are written in<br/>simultaneous meters. One of my new compositions &quot;Ten Thousand<br/>Things&quot;, has polymetrical cycles of 5, 7, 11, and 13/4, where many<br/>percussion, singing voices and metallophones are all playing in<br/>polymeters.

Paul is<br/>&gt; absolutely right in putting rhythm even before melody: that is the<br/>&gt; way music must have evolved.  In fact, rhythm reigns supreme even<br/>&gt; today, especially in the area of popular music.  The &quot;primitive&quot;<br/>folk<br/>&gt; music also heavily depends on the beat to which is rendered a<br/>rather<br/>&gt; simple, short, lilting little melodic refrain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=18623 href="#18623">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2001 11:33:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:<br/>&gt; Haresh,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello!

In this connection, a very apt and<br/>pithy expression of our sentiments comes from the following well-<br/>known Sanskrit saying, slightly modified:<br/>The subject [of music] is so vast, that if the oceans form the ink<br/>reservoir, if kalpavriksha [the tree that grants any wish made while<br/>standing under it] acts as the pen for writing, if the Earth surface<br/>becomes available as the sheet of paper, and if Ganesha [God of<br/>Learning] Himself goes on writing forever [about music], even then<br/>not enough can be written.</p><p>But, as James Thurber once said, &quot;It&apos;s better to know some of the<br/>questions than all of the answers.&quot;  So all the present (and future)<br/>participants have started discussions about melody, harmony, and<br/>their interrelationship.  This augers well for Indian music.</p><p>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=18658 href="#18658">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/13/2001 8:11:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18503.html#18598">/tuning/topicId_18503.html#18598</a></p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_18503.html#18521">/tuning/topicId_18503.html#18521</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SHRUTI: The Indian Imbroglio II<br/>&gt; ....................<br/>&gt; Hi, thanks for your input: it is very important to me.

One of my new compositions &quot;Ten Thousand<br/>&gt; Things&quot;, has polymetrical cycles of 5, 7, 11, and 13/4, where many<br/>&gt; percussion, singing voices and metallophones are all playing in<br/>&gt; polymeters.

This is,<br/>strictly, not a case of polymetric cycles because all are playing the<br/>same taala, and the variation comes from the improvisation on the<br/>percussion instruments. (2) Again, this is not a case of polymetric<br/>cycles, except, perhaps, loosely.  Here, during accompaniment to the<br/>main performer, the tabla player plays the bol-s (sounds) of a taala<br/>other than the one in which the performer is performing.  For<br/>example, the table player plays the bol-s of jhaptaala (10 beats)<br/>while the singer is singing in teentaala (16 beats). The tabla<br/>player, of course, adjusts the tempo of the jhaptaala so that he<br/>correctly joins the singer on the first beat. Thus, he would play<br/>jhaptaala at a tempo such that he completes his 10-beat cycle exactly<br/>when the singer (now, mentally) completes his 16-beat teentaala<br/>cycle.

I would agree that for serious recording/performance<br/>though, it would seem there could be no compromise about not using<br/>the real thing. It is such a lovely sound!</p><p>&gt; I am a singer of Hindustani (North Indian) classical music, Gwalior<br/>&gt; gharana (school).  Names of my guru-s: Pandit Eknath Padgaonkar and<br/>&gt; Ustad Gulam Kader Khan. I also teach Sitar and Tabla playing (which<br/>I<br/>&gt; learnt long, long time ago, during the 3-year period starting when<br/>my<br/>&gt; voice began to change).  I also &quot;play&quot; Indian raga-s on the<br/>keyboard<br/>&gt; (and explain all the limitations and compromises that this would<br/>&gt; require).  .</p><p>It is really wonderful to have you here Haresh! And that you play all<br/>of these and sing too! I&apos;m just so impressed.</p><p>Could you please tell me if you have any CDs of your singing<br/>available? I would immediately purchase one. I absolutely adore<br/>Hindustani vocal music, and it would be delighted to hear your<br/>performance.</p><p>Is it the Harmonium you speak of above when you mention playing raga-<br/>s on the keyboard? Aren&apos;t they normally in 12 tET? Sometimes I ponder<br/>how this could ever be acceptable in Indian music where there is so<br/>much wonderful deviation from our Western 12 tET scale.  Do you know<br/>if any are manufactured which allow easy retuning to the desired<br/>intervals?</p><p>Have you ever experimented with a microtonally tunable synthesizer? I<br/>hear synthesizers in Indian pop, but I think usually in 12 tET.</p><p>Is it at all troubling to Indian music<br/>scholars/practitioners/performers, that the Western 12 tET Scale may<br/>become too accepted, by infiltrating its way into the popular music<br/>by way of Western style keyboards?  I really hope it never does! We<br/>are still trying to work our way out of the ingrained tyranny of this<br/>system.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 4.    What raagas do you enjoy most, and perhaps why?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A very difficult question!</p><p>Yes, I realized this after I sent it, and thanks for your patience.</p><p>Every singer finds himself singing<br/>&gt; certain raga-s more frequently than other raga-s.  It is in<br/>&gt; those &apos;favorite&apos; raga-s that he probably instinctively feels that<br/>he<br/>&gt; brings out the best, both of the raga-s and of himself. Really, I<br/>&gt; have never given thought to this question!  Some of my favorite<br/>raga-<br/>&gt; s are: Bilaskhani Todi, Lalit, Shuddha Sarang, Bhimpalasi, Marwa,<br/>&gt; Yaman, Bihag, Bageshri, Darbari Kanada, Malkaus, Maru Bihag, Miya<br/>&gt; Malhar, Bhairavi.  And some more .....!</p><p>Thanks for this! Please let me (and the list) know about the<br/>availability of CDs. I would enjoy hearing you sing any of these!</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
