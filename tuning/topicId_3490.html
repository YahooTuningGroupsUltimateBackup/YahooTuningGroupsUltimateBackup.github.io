They&apos;re all based on the black note<br/>scale being Pythagorean, and the white notes tempered to something like<br/>meantone.</p><p>The first has C-G-D-A tempered.  Quite daring as those fifths are so out.<br/>It means they reach meantone size, so it&apos;s a bit like meantone without<br/>wolves.</p><p>0 90.2 192.2 294.1 384.4 498.0 588.3 696.1 792.2 888.3 996.1 1086.3 1200<br/>= -10   -8     -6    -6   -2   -12    -4    -8    -2    -4    -14<br/>+2 -8   -6     -4    -4   +0   -10    -2    -6     =    -2    -12</p><p>Now, F-C, G-D-A-E and B-F# are tempered.  This gets close to equal, with one<br/>fewer tempered fifth than Valotti &amp; Young:</p><p>0 94.9 199.2 298.8 393.7 502.7 593.0 702.0 796.9 896.5 1000.8 1095.7 1200<br/>=  -5   -1    -1    -6    +2    -7    +2    -3    -3     +1     -4<br/>+3 -2   +2    +2    -3    +5    -2    +5    +0     =     +4     +0</p><p>Finally, F-C, G-D-A and E-B tempered.  This is symmetric about D.  It&apos;s a<br/>bit like meantone, what with the fifths being spread out to favour the<br/>thirds.  I think this is my favourite of the three, although it&apos;s so long<br/>ago I played with them I can&apos;t be sure.</p><p>0 96.1 198.0 300.0 396.1 503.9 594.1 702.0 798.0 894.1 1002.0 1092.2 1200<br/>= -4    +2     =    -4    +4    -6    +2    -2    -6     +2     -8<br/>+6 +2   +8    +6    +2   +10     =    +8    +4     =     +8     -2</p><p>If any of these have names, I&apos;d like to know them.</p><p>Now, while I&apos;m at it, here&apos;s a lattice for a meantone-like just intonation:</p><p>                        B<br/>                       /<br/>                      /<br/>                     /<br/>                    G<br/>                   /<br/>            F#----/-C#<br/>           / \   / /<br/>          /   \ Eb/<br/>         /     \ /<br/>        D-------A<br/>       / \     /<br/>      / G#\   /<br/>     / /   \ /<br/>    Bb/-----F<br/>     /<br/>    E<br/>   /<br/>  /<br/> /<br/>C</p><p>For those who don&apos;t read lattices, it&apos;s tuned so that D-A is a just fifth,<br/>and F-A and A-C# are just thirds.  Then, F#-C# and Bb-F are tuned to be just<br/>fifths.  Then, G# is tuned so that Bb-G# is a just 7/4, and Bb7 is the<br/>7-limit version.  C and E are tuned in thirds from that.  And Eb, G and B<br/>are similarly tuned so that Eb-C# is a just 7/4.</p><p>This sounds pretty much like meantone, with the bonus of a few just chords<br/>in there.  Fifths that aren&apos;t just are worse than 1/4 comma meantone.  C-G<br/>and E-B are 7.7 cents flat.  The others, except the wolf G#-Eb, are 6.1<br/>cents flat.</p><p>This technique of just thirds with just 7-limit intervals can be made closer<br/>to meantone.  However, I find nothing wrong with this tuning.  So, the<br/>question is, do the piano tuners on the list think it could be tuned by ear?<br/>And, do techniques like this have any historical significance?</p><p>                      Graham<br/>        <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/tuning.htm">http://www.cix.co.uk/~gbreed/tuning.htm</a></p></div><h3>Brett Barbaro &#x3C;barbaro@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/1999 12:53:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham Breed wrote,</p><p>&gt; Now, while I&apos;m at it, here&apos;s a lattice for a meantone-like just intonation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                         B<br/>&gt;                        /<br/>&gt;                       /<br/>&gt;                      /<br/>&gt;                     G<br/>&gt;                    /<br/>&gt;             F#----/-C#<br/>&gt;            / \   / /<br/>&gt;           /   \ Eb/<br/>&gt;          /     \ /<br/>&gt;         D-------A<br/>&gt;        / \     /<br/>&gt;       / G#\   /<br/>&gt;      / /   \ /<br/>&gt;     Bb/-----F<br/>&gt;      /<br/>&gt;     E<br/>&gt;    /<br/>&gt;   /<br/>&gt;  /<br/>&gt; C<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For those who don&apos;t read lattices, it&apos;s tuned so that D-A is a just fifth,<br/>&gt; and F-A and A-C# are just thirds.
