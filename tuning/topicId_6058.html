I&apos;ve not had access to the<br/>voluminous spectroscopic data (yeah, right!) residing in the classified<br/>section of the vaults of the Big Three.<br/>As a mid-&apos;40&apos;s child I remember hearing a wide variety of timbres and<br/>intervals in automotive horns. The un-muted trumpet tone whas present, but<br/>the &quot;amplified Miles Davis&quot; sound was very common. Our &apos;41 Shevvy had such a<br/>horn, playing a d-f Minor Thirds in warm weather; a DB-F major third in<br/>cold. Some Ford models had a C-EB horn with that same timbre but with a very<br/>prominent formant around 1600 hz. Bizzz-zarre!<br/>My neighbor&apos;s &apos;46 Plymouth had an open-trumpet horn at dB-GB and I heard<br/>variably-pitched perfect-4th horns on radio adverts.<br/>The single-note horn was there, E flat being the most common. (All this was<br/>in Minnesota. I&apos;ve no idea if demographics played a part in horn calls then)<br/>By late &apos;48/early &apos;49, just when &quot;fluid drive&quot; diesel-electric locomotives<br/>were changing the sonic landscape, the open-trumpet, minor third horn<br/>prevailed. There have always been renegades, but from then untill the early<br/>&apos;60&apos;s, that horn was ubiquitous. There again, the third could drift from<br/>minor to a Pythagorean-sound maujor depending on, um, I dunno, the emotions<br/>of the guy to stamped the diaphragm?<br/>Then, around the time the touchtone phone came and we got that F-A dialtone,<br/>so the F-A carhorn arose to ascendancy. After that, most carhorns were at<br/>that pitch or high, up to a_C#. Major thirds seem to have edged ahead of<br/>minor thirds.<br/>Also, under the influence of imported cars, we got back to the wondrous<br/>variety of the early &apos;40&apos;s again. (Again, the stated pitches are average.<br/>Pitch may vary  without notification of customer. Void where prohibited.)<br/>Truck horns: I never heard a maj or third one when it comes to &quot;serious&quot; air<br/>horns. All Minor Thirds and they go as low as G below Middle C.<br/>Train whistles: the five-horn variety could play any number of exotic<br/>chords, but it seems to me that the e-g-b-d-e (pitch can vary) variety was<br/>more prevalent. I _have heard a g-BB-D-F-A-C, yes, a 6-note wonder. In the<br/>4-note class, a half-diminished chord was common, but I remember, one &quot;dark<br/>and stromy night&quot;, hearing one play F-BB-EB-GB. Ominous one, that.<br/>Then the diesels came in and for nigh on to ten years they blew either a<br/>single note (from the D to E below middle C) or a dual horn, usually a<br/>fifth, but some times a Minor 6, and one engine blew a Minor 2nd for about a<br/>year. I heard they stopped using these horns because, in Northern climes, it<br/>attracted moose and other consequential critters onto the tracks.<br/>So they went back to chorded horns, and we now also have three-note ones.<br/>Either a Major triad in first inversion, or a Diminished triad in first<br/>inversion. My question, is this sort of news to folks living across the<br/>pond? I notice that, in movies and other documents of British and European<br/>travel that the trains have single-note hooters that are rarely below about<br/>700 hz.<br/>Well, there&apos;s your light reading for the day. Sorry for the typos, but I&apos;m<br/>without feedback while in Windows for a day or two, so I&apos;m flying blinder<br/>than usual, but I jiss hadta get in on this horn thingie.</p></div><h3>Bill Schottstaedt &#x3C;bil@xxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/1999 7:47:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Either a Major triad in first inversion</p><p>this was used by the Rock Island/AT&amp;SF trains in Oklahoma<br/>in the 50&apos;s -- very beautiful sound drifting across the<br/>wheat fields.</p></div><h3>johnlink@xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>11/10/1999 7:50:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you Jay!</p><p>John Link<br/>ALMOST ACAPPELLA</p><p>&gt;From: Jay Williams &lt;<a href="mailto:jaywill@utah-inter.net">jaywill@utah-inter.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;What follows is based on my &quot;pitch memory&quot;.
