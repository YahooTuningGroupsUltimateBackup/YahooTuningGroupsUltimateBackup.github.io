Another possible source for<br/>timing (and maybe more likley cause it would be cheaper) would simply be<br/>dividing the bus clock (about 8 MHz for ISA and 33 MHz for PCI). I wouldn&apos;t<br/>be surprised if there were slight variations in both timing sources from<br/>computer to computer.</p><p>As for the first question: I&apos;m sure 99% of sound card owners are not<br/>concerned with the tuning of their sound card&apos;s build in synthesiser.<br/>Therefore, it&apos;s not a cost-effective marketing tactic for a sound card<br/>manufacturer to include any tuning software or hardware for the product. In<br/>terms of the digital nature of sound card synthesisers, a lot of the old<br/>and/or low-end on board synths are the Yamaho OPL-8, which is an analog FM<br/>synthesiser. Newer and high-end cards would use wave table synthesis, but<br/>that doesn&apos;t make up for the problems mentioned in my previous paragraph.</p><p>An interesting experiment might be to see if the same sound card plays at a<br/>different overall pitch when installed in different computers, or even in<br/>the same computer with other hardware differences (other devices on the ISA<br/>bus, maybe).</p><p>Todd Wilcox</p></div><h3><a id=17381 href="#17381">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Alves &#x3C;ALVES@ORION.AC.HMC.EDU&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2001 9:17:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dimitris Tziouris wrote:</p><p>&gt;am looking for a painless way to teach my computer just intonation.

Csound was not originally designed to be a realtime system, but<br/>it can work as such. However, the realtime capabilities vary considerably<br/>depending on the operating system and Csound version. I understand that<br/>Gabriel Maldanado&apos;s DirectSound for Windows works fairly well in a realtime<br/>environment, though unfortunately I haven&apos;t tried it myself.</p><p>There are examples of how to use realtime in the documentation, but the<br/>best introduction is in the Csound Book and accompanying CD-ROMs. The<br/>CD-ROM has a whole section with example instruments for realtime<br/>performance, and see also Paris Smaragdis&apos; optimization chapter. Though<br/>Csound is a fairly complex and powerful program, what you are talking about<br/>(a certain frequency in response to a key depression) would be pretty<br/>straight-forward. There are several tutorials on the web that give you a<br/>basic introduction to Csound. See the links from the Csound front page at<br/><a href="http://www.csound.org/">http://www.csound.org/</a>.</p><p>As far as pitch accuracy, Csound generates sound files Csound with<br/>floating-point representation of pitch. This means that the difference<br/>between 20 hz and the next highest representable frequency is only about<br/>0.00021 cents. This number gets proportionately lower as frequencies go up.<br/>Whether your sound card plays them back as accurately as Csound generates<br/>them may be another question, but that would generally affect only the<br/>absolute pitch (if the DAC clock is off). (Daniel Wolf claims that he has<br/>heard audible artifacts if very long sine waves are slightly off the<br/>subharmonics of the sampling rate (44.1Khz for CD). I haven&apos;t heard these<br/>effects, but they sound intriguing.)</p><p>I should add these composers to previous replies to Joseph Pehrson&apos;s query<br/>about alternate tuning compositions with Csound: John ffitch, Lydia Ayers,<br/>Eric Lyon, and Larry Polansky (I think -- he used to work in HML).</p><p>Joseph Pehrson also asked about the Csound mailing list. Unfortunately, the<br/>server at the University of Bath has been going through some rough times,<br/>and John ffitch may be having to manually add people to the mailing list.<br/>There should be a confirmation email from the server before you are added.<br/>The traffic on the Csound list is a little less than that of the tuning<br/>list, but I still have received 7 Csound messages since yesterday afternoon.</p><p>He also asked:</p><p>&gt;And, could someone briefly and gently explain what Linux is??  I&apos;m<br/>&gt;guessing that it is an alternate operating system to DOS/Windows (??)</p><p>You guessed correctly. It is descended from Unix and inherited some of its<br/>powerful features. Though it may not be quite as easy to use and there<br/>isn&apos;t as much software available as Windows, that&apos;s changing, and it is<br/>free. I should warn you that there are two different versions of Csound for<br/>Linux -- the &quot;canonical&quot; or Bath version, which is pretty much the same as<br/>the other versions for Mac, Windows, etc., and the &quot;unofficial&quot; or<br/>Developer&apos;s Group Version, which differs in some details but I guess is<br/>more optimized for realtime performance.</p><p>&gt;I thought Linux was a character invented by Charles Schultz in<br/>&gt;&quot;Peanuts...&quot;</p><p>You must be thinking of Snoopix.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.
