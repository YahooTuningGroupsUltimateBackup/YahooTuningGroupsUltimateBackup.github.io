BTW you find<br/>&gt; the same type of Near 7-ET among the Chopi tribe of Mozambique.<br/>&gt; This I have one sample of as being the most accurate at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/chopi.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/chopi.PDF</a> which i got from Andrew tracy who<br/>&gt; father collected quite a few measurements in the mid forties but<br/>&gt; only had a set of tunings forks tuned 4 vibration apart.

Maybe<br/>I&apos;ll use this one if that&apos;s okay.</p><p>I see the steps vary quite a bit in this scale:</p><p>182.4  174.2  170.9  178.2  170.5  162.0  167.4<br/>181.8  167.3  187.7  170.8  166.7  172.5  159.4<br/>198.6  155.8  188.1  158.8  143.8</p><p>Also vary from one octave to the next.

I did an organ piece related to this<br/>scale type which is on my &quot;Interiors&quot; and found myself using quite long sustains. Let me know if<br/>this produces much of interest. It appears due t o the recent floods and such, he is the last<br/>tuner of his tribe. If not for Hugh and Andrew Tracy, all could have vanished without our notice.<br/>If these scales are the base race as in seeds, 7ET could be the GMO version.

The film, a wonderful enthnomusicology<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; achievement, was made by Swiss scholar Hugo Zemp.  As I recall the 7<br/>&gt; was<br/>&gt; equal, and it was tuned by setting up the smallest interval of the<br/>&gt; scale as<br/>&gt; something to refer to on a bamboo tube that was pre-cut.  The music is<br/>&gt; fun,<br/>&gt; with several people joining in, demonstrating the harmonic qualities<br/>&gt; that the<br/>&gt; tuning offers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been to Thai restaurants that have xylophones in equal -7.  Other<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; examples of 7 (more equal than non- as in Cambodia), include the some<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; Central Africa (Cameroun-mayble a bit less than equal), and as I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; been<br/>&gt; told...the Puna of Panama (which I have not had the opportunity to<br/>&gt; hear).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My piece &quot;MIllennium&quot; uses 7-tET (for violin, tenor sax, and bassoon)<br/>&gt; as does<br/>&gt; a section from my string quartet (&quot;Cosmic Rays&quot; where it is mixed with<br/>&gt; 5 and<br/>&gt; 11 ets, isometrically), in my bassoon solo &quot;Zanzibar&quot; (where I<br/>&gt; improvise in<br/>&gt; the tuning), and in my symphony (&quot;Middle-earth&quot;) in the strings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 7-tET is a great tuning.
