Some pieces make very creative use<br/>of &quot;beats&quot; (as in drum beat loops); an art-form in  itself to be<br/>respected.  Mary also has a delightfully lovely singing voice - the<br/>best microtonal instrument conceivable.</p><p>I also enjoyed the spoken word pieces on <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a>, and just generally<br/>loved all I heard.</p><p>Keep up the beautiful music Mary, and please let us all know as new<br/>material becomes available. You&apos;ve got my attention.</p><p>Peace,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div>
