Today, I&apos;m sending two versions of my new piece. One of them was done in the way I usually do it --  I loaded the tuning to my keyboard and played in it from the very beginning. Wishing to have some intervals more &quot;in tune&quot;, I decided to make one more version where the octaves would be stretched to about 1216 cents. Unfortunately, because my keyboard can only tune scales with no other period than 2/1, I had to use Scala and retune the piece by changing pitch-bend values. In the end, I was very VERY disappointed because the pitch-bend changes made some tones change their pitches even during sounding (the problem is that Scala thinks the pitch is no longer important to preserve as soon as you release the key but that is not true for sounds with longer release time). If anyone of you had an idea what other way I could use for retuning my music to avoid this problem, I would be really glad to know.</p><p>Okay, this is what Scala has done with it: <a href="http://download.yousendit.com/A19856720004B181">http://download.yousendit.com/A19856720004B181</a></p><p>And this is the original version with pure octaves: <a href="http://download.yousendit.com/75046B02149ABC6D">http://download.yousendit.com/75046B02149ABC6D</a></p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=76065 href="#76065">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2008 7:22:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr Pa&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;zek wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi again.<br/>&gt; &gt; I see you keep passionately discussing different topics but I think you &gt; still have some time to spare and listen to music.

So when Scala reuses a channel, there might have been a recently playing note with a different pitch bend. You could check your synth manual to see if there are any different modes for how a voice responds to pitch bend.</p><p>One thing you might try in a MIDI editor is uniformly stretch the duration of all notes (without changing the start time). Then do the Scala retuning, then change the note durations back. E.g., stretch all notes to 125%, then after retuning, reduce the durations to 80%.</p><p>1216 cents is pretty extreme. The TOP-RMS period for 11-limit superpelog is 1208.961340 cents, with a generator of 261.900821. But the contrast of the extra-wide octaves with the relatively smooth harmony is definitely an interesting effect.</p></div><h3><a id=76067 href="#76067">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2008 2:34:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Herman wrote:</p><p>&gt; One thing you might try in a MIDI editor is uniformly stretch the<br/>&gt; duration of all notes (without changing the start time).

If I&rsquo;m understanding<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you correctly, do you mean that each track would hold just the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; music for one octave of the entire syst&eacute;m and then these would be<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mixed down? Or, to say it in 12-EDO terminology, that there would<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be only the 12 tones from C1 to B1 used in the first track, then<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; C2 to B2 in the second track and so on -- is that it?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Charles Lucy<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="mailto:lucy@lucytune.com">lucy@lucytune.com</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; - Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning -<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; For LucyTuned Lullabies go to:<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Charles Lucy<br/><a href="mailto:lucy@lucytune.com">lucy@lucytune.com</a></p><p>- Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning -</p><p>for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>For LucyTuned Lullabies go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p></div><h3><a id=76080 href="#76080">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2008 12:32:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Got it!

I don&apos;t read this forum as often as I used to (working hard on the programming and web site :-) ).</p><p>You can download the program from<br/><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/fts_download.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/fts_download.htm</a></p><p>When you install it, look in the Tune Smithy 3 Tasks folder on your desktop to find the task appropriate for what you want to do.</p><p>Also - many of the windows have More / Less buttons. Click  the &gt;&gt; More button for more controls / options or the &lt;&lt; button for a simpler more compact window.</p><p>The documentation is installed with the program. There&apos;s F1 help for most of the windows - shows up in your browser (web page format). There&apos;s also individual help for many of the controls in the windows.  When you hover the mouse over a contorl - if you see a tool tip, and the tip ends with &quot;...&quot; then there&apos;s extra help which you can show using Shift + F1.</p><p>The documentation however lags a bit behind  the program as I released it first and plan to update the help later. The tool tip help is the most up to date but still incomplete especially for many of  the newer options in the program. The help also has got rather extensive and needs a radical re-organisation to make it easier to find what you want on a specific topic. Again I plan to deal with that later.</p><p>So if you can&apos;t find out how to do something from the help - it may be there and hard to find, or I may not have documented it yet.
