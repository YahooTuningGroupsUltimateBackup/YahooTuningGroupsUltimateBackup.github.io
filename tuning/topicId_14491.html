Probably you know most I just discover in. However<br/>it seems that it contains remarkable thoughts about relations between<br/>rythmic precision, musical sensibility, text intelligibility, spiritual goal.</p><p>Generally, I&apos;m concerned by forest rather than trees. However, this<br/>particular tree retains my attention by the (apparent) high degree of<br/>perfection and  understanding achieved. I find there parallel problematics<br/>with scales and multiple fine tuning ajustments about what I&apos;d soon written<br/>&quot;Sur l&apos;intervalle de dur&eacute;e et la forme temporelle&quot; (not yet published),<br/>finding analogy in tsigane music.</p><p>It&apos;s for essential the text of a conference at first &quot;Congr&egrave;s<br/>Inter-am&eacute;ricain de Musique Sacr&eacute;e du Mexique&quot; in november 1949.</p><p>So, I&apos;m sorry if I&apos;ll be a bit long returning to systematic answers. I&apos;m<br/>more concerned by inspiration than discipline.</p><p>-Pierre</p></div>
