So that&apos;s<br/>&quot;using JI&quot;.</p><p>Sorry to nitpick.  But if the aim is to clear up confusion... why not take<br/>steps to avoid the very error made by the JI fanatics?</p><p>&gt;&gt;Wilson favorite pastime is pointing out commatic shifts in all types of<br/>&gt;&gt;western singers on tape. Once again Boomsliter and Creel showed this in<br/>&gt;&gt;actually measurements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I would like to see more evidence of this.</p><p>I&apos;m not aware of any Boomsliter and Creel material that measured the<br/>intonation of recordings.  They did, however, conduct a study where<br/>musicians and non-musicians alike were allowed to tune familiar melodies in<br/>any way they wanted, within the confines of a modified Reed organ.  While<br/>the study was hardly scientific, it is fairly convincing, and I do buy<br/>their extended reference theory, which is not really much of a theory,<br/>unfortunately.  It basically states that many common melodies make use of a<br/>parenthesis-closing type hierarchy, with melodic intervals all being just<br/>when related to the appropriate point in the hierarchy.  The reason it<br/>doesn&apos;t amount to a theory is that a method for identifying the hierarchy<br/>in a given melody was never put forth.  Hierarchies were identified in a<br/>number of melodies, and shown to match &quot;preferred tunings&quot; from experiment,<br/>but it was never shown that a given melody has only one such interpretation.</p><p>Extended reference falls under what I&apos;ve recently been calling &quot;local&quot;<br/>melodic JI.  While I do buy into it, and think in principle the problems<br/>mentioned above could be solved, I believe it is only one effect which a<br/>melody may use; plenty of melodies exist which do not use the<br/>parenthesis-closing effect.</p><p>It should also be noted that the parenthesis-closing effect does not<br/>require JI.  Its potential simply depends on the number of notes at its<br/>disposal.  I have referred to this as the &quot;weak argument&quot; for microtonality<br/>(TD 173.2 and elsewhere).  But when combined with my &quot;first sentence&quot; (TD<br/>441.15), you get Extended Reference.</p><p>&gt;It would certainly run counter to what I&apos;ve been saying, but as far as I&apos;m<br/>&gt;concerned any reason to overthrow the hegemony of 12-tET is a good thing.<br/>&gt;Hopefully it would not be to replace it with a hegemony of strict JI.<br/>&gt;Without the puns of temperament most Western keyboard compositions and my<br/>&gt;decatonic stuff would be out the window.</p><p>I don&apos;t think you have any reason to worry, Paul -- puns are definitely tha<br/>bomb.  Thing is, puns have nothing to do with melody.  At least I&apos;ve always<br/>considered them a harmonic effect.</p><p>I don&apos;t believe, in general, that commatic shifts change the melodic<br/>identity of notes.  By increasing the size of the melodic pitch set (or<br/>perhaps by decreasing the certainty with which it is defined), commatic<br/>shifts may rob a melody of clarity.  OTOH, if the shifts are due to<br/>extended reference, they add a level of information to the melody.  But I<br/>don&apos;t think they effect puns (directly).</p><p>A pun to me is a forced re-fitting of a dyad or larger-ad in the harmonic<br/>series.  For example, in 12, when modulating from D7 to FM, the dyad A:C<br/>has changed from a 7/6 to a 6/5.  So for me, the ability to pun is measured<br/>by the uniqueness of a temperament.</p><p>I&apos;ve always believed that puns add something to music -- and that they take<br/>something away.  They necessarily take away consonance, and also any effect<br/>depending on the &quot;weak argument&quot;, since they are only possible in the<br/>smaller temperaments.  It would be very interesting to search for ETs with<br/>low uniqueness yet high consonance.  12 is certainly the king.  After that<br/>must be 15 and 22.</p><p>Since I&apos;ve joined this list, I&apos;ve been an advocate of JI.  It hasn&apos;t been<br/>because I don&apos;t believe in puns.  Rather, I&apos;m interested in what may be<br/>gained from greater consonance, and larger pitch sets.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=7026 href="#7026">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
