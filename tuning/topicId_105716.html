Let&apos;s consider the equal bisection<br/>first. One historian, Walter Feldman if I&apos;m correct, suggests<br/>that a near-equal division of the 32/27 may have been favored in<br/>Ottoman practice around 1700 or so in order to permit use of the<br/>same fret for either a large or small neutral second -- a bit<br/>like the desire in the 16th-century on the lute to use the same<br/>fret for either a major or minor semitone, thus 12-EDO<br/>approximations.</p><p>   This tempers as</p><p>   ! ushaq99.scl<br/>   !<br/>   yarman_ushaq in 99ef tempering<br/>   8<br/>   !<br/>   145.45455<br/>   290.90909<br/>   496.96970<br/>   703.03030<br/>   787.87879<br/>   848.48485<br/>   993.93939<br/>   1200.00000</p><p>In fact, either this or 41-EDO has a division very close to<br/>medieval rational option, 4608:4235:3888 (146.134-148.001 cents)<br/>for dividing 32/27 into two near-equal parts. The trick back then<br/>was simply to place a fret midway between the 256/243 and 9/8<br/>frets, resulting in an arithmetic bisection of the apotome and an<br/>almost geometrically equal division of 32/27. (Since 32/27 is<br/>equal to a limma plus an apotome plus a limma, an equal neutral<br/>second would be a limma plus half of an apotome.) Cris Forster<br/>discusses this division in his _Musical Mathematics_.</p><p>However, what 99-EDO or thereabouts also lets us do is have<br/>subtly unequal divisions of the kind that Ozan Yarman was seeking<br/>here. We could have 133-158 cents for an unequal division of the<br/>291-cent third with a distinction of around a comma, or a 133-145<br/>division for a smaller 278-cent third that might be very<br/>stylistic in some Turkish styles (as well as in the related modal<br/>family of Persian Shur).</p><p>So neutral seconds at 133-145-157 cents, and minor thirds at<br/>278 and 291 cents, would give lots of flexibility!</p><p>Also, Ozan Yarman meant this tuning to be used for either Makam<br/>Ushaq or Makam Huseyni. While all Turkish performers do not agree<br/>with this in theory or practice, there is at least in some<br/>schools a tendency to play the second degree of Huseyni higher,<br/>with 157 cents a reasonable choice in this gamut -- I&apos;d say just<br/>below or around 11/10 might be ideal, but 169.7 cents a bit high<br/>(Ozan, at least, feels that something as large as 1/7 octave is<br/>not so generally characteristic of maqam, so it&apos;s a fine line).</p><p>But your tuning very neatly supports either 133-145 or 145-145<br/>for Ushaq, and 157-133 for Huseyni. Actually some measurement<br/>I&apos;ve seen suggest even 157-121 might not be unstylish for a<br/>Turkish Huseyni, although 121 cents is more a large semitone (say<br/>15/14) than a small neutral second (say 14/13). Given that a<br/>Turkish &quot;middle interval&quot; may be as small as a Pythagorean<br/>apotome or as large as a double limma -- from around 16/15 to<br/>10/9, putting aside schismas -- 157-121 as an option wouldn&apos;t be<br/>too surprising, and it&apos;s yet another choice in ennealimmal!</p><p>Also, there&apos;s another convention mentioned by Scott Marcus in<br/>Egypt and shown by some Turkish measurements: in Turkish Ushaq,<br/>the neutral second tends to be smaller than the neutral sixth; in<br/>Huseyni, they may both tend to be high. Thus in Huseyni, you<br/>might do 157-861 cents; in Ushaq, something like 145-861 or<br/>even 133-861. A big advantage of ennealimmal is that you can<br/>observe such nuances, and still have the choice of 145-291<br/>in the lower tetrachord, for example, when you want it.</p><p>Additionally, there&apos;s an element of sheer melodic<br/>expressiveness. Playing the neutral second step a bit higher when<br/>ascending to the 4/3 step than when descending to the 1/1 (a<br/>nuance noted by Ali Jihad Racy and reported by Scott Marcus), or<br/>maybe vice versa (a possibility mentioned by Amine Beyhom), is a<br/>mark of refinement that the highly refined ennealimmal can<br/>support.</p><p>And for a really low Ushaq, let&apos;s not forget 133-133 with its<br/>near-just 7/6! Ozan Yarman had one example of something this low,<br/>but it&apos;s a nice variation on 14:13:12 or 12:13:14 with the<br/>169/168 tempered out. I tend to observe the comma, but either is<br/>quite valid and beautiful.</p><p>&gt;  A few hours later I noticed that this</p><p>   ! segah_rat.scl<br/>   !<br/>   Rationalized Arabic Seg?<br/>   7<br/>   !<br/>   9/8<br/>   11/9<br/>   4/3<br/>   3/2<br/>   27/16<br/>   11/6<br/>   2/1</p><p>One clarification: this looks like something other than Arabic<br/>Sikah (the Arabic version of the Persian name Segah, the &quot;third&quot;<br/>step or mode, etc.). It&apos;s a permutation of al-Farabi&apos;s<br/>9:8-12:11-88:81 with the two upper steps reversed. One Arab<br/>theorist has called this Rast Jadid or &quot;New Rast,&quot; but Segah is<br/>different -- more shortly.</p><p>&gt;   also makes sense in the same temperament:</p><p>   ! segah99.scl<br/>   !<br/>   segah_rat in 99ef tempering<br/>   7<br/>   !<br/>   206.06061<br/>   351.51515<br/>   496.96970<br/>   703.03030<br/>   909.09091<br/>   1054.54545<br/>   1200.00000</p><p>Yes, you could do it this way, using a literal hemififth, a bit<br/>like 24-EDO or 41-EDO. But that 351-cent step, at least in a<br/>Turkish context, has another neat and very idiomatic use for a<br/>very clueful performance! Why note 206-364-497 cents for your<br/>usual moderate Turkish Rast (with 364 cents close to a<br/>theoretical 16 commas and also to one measured average), but 351<br/>cents as a descending gesture when making a final cadence. I tend<br/>to observe a full comma distinction (370 vs. 346 cents), but the<br/>ideal might be a bit more subtle, and ennealimmal gives us that<br/>more subtle option! You might also then want 1067 cents as well<br/>as 1054 cents for a neutral seventh, etc.</p><p>And for a low Rast Jadid (or Persian modal form like Shekaste),<br/>you might want 206-339-497. The main point is that with<br/>ennealimmal, we have lots of these options!</p><p>But how about Segah, often known in Arabic as Sikah? Here&apos;s a<br/>2-3-11 version based on a permutation of al-Farabi&apos;s Zalzalian<br/>mode (zalzal.scl):</p><p>! segah-zalzalian.scl<br/>!<br/>Arabic Segah (or Sikah) based on zalzal.scl (step 5 = 1/1)<br/> 7<br/>!<br/> 88/81<br/> 11/9<br/> 11/8<br/> 3/2<br/> 44/27<br/> 11/6<br/> 2/1</p><p>Note that Segah or Sikah means &quot;third,&quot; and this is basically a<br/>rotation of a disjunct Rast starting on the third step, or a<br/>conjunct Rast like zalzal.scl starting on step 5 (the neutral<br/>sixth degree). It divides into a Sikah (Segah) trichord<br/>1/1-88/81-11/9; a Rast tetrachord 11/9-11/8-3/2-44/27; and a<br/>Rast trichord 44/27-11/6-2/1 often tending to ascend to the<br/>neutral second above the octave, the 176/81.</p><p>Here&apos;s a possible 99-EDO version using your 351-cent and 849-cent<br/>intervals, for the most part, but adding something to help a<br/>stylish performance: a slightly higher version of the neutral<br/>seventh degree for approaching the 1/1 or 2/1 step of the mode.<br/>So we can use 1055 cents as the regular step, but 1067 cents<br/>for a cadential leading tone.</p><p>! arab_segah-99edo.scl<br/>!<br/>99-edo Arab Segah with extra slightly raised leading tone to final<br/> 8<br/>!<br/> 145.45455<br/> 351.51515<br/> 557.57576<br/> 703.03030<br/> 848.48485<br/> 1054.54545<br/> 1066.66667<br/> 2/1</p><p>Here we could also substitute 133, 339, and 1042 cents for<br/>145, 351, and 1054 cents, making 1067 cents a more decidedly<br/>contrasting leading tone. With ennealimmal, a variety of shades<br/>are available!</p><p>&gt;  Today I noticed that Robert &quot;Inventor&quot; Walker has a scale which also makes sense<br/>&gt;  in this temperament:</p><p>   ! walker.scl<br/>   !<br/>   Robert Walker&apos;s <a href="http://2.3.11.13">2.3.11.13</a> scale<br/>   7<br/>   !<br/>   12/11<br/>   11/9<br/>   4/3<br/>   3/2<br/>   13/8<br/>   11/6<br/>   2/1</p><p>&gt;  Robert noticed that you can temper by 144/143 and 243/242 himself. Do it and you<br/>&gt;  get Namo[7]--a MOS of a temperament I had forgotten about, but which obviously<br/>&gt;  keeps turning up.</p><p>I&apos;ve seen things a bit like this in some of Jacques Dudon&apos;s<br/>tunings like mohajira_r.scl where we have 59/48 and 11/6, with<br/>this fifth narrow by 177/176; here we have 12/11 and 13/8 with<br/>the fifth narrow by 144/143. Change the 12/11 step to 13/12, and<br/>you have one routine JI version of Mohajira that George Secor<br/>found also (1/1-13/12-11/9-4/3-3/2-13/8-11/6-2/1). This involves<br/>a 352/351 distinction, which could be observed or tempered out.<br/>And a precedent might be William Lyman Young&apos;s young-wt.scl, a<br/>slightly different permutation of the same basic idea.</p><p>But my main point here is that ennealimmal lets us emulate some<br/>of the comma or half-comma nuances of maqam tunings like Ozan<br/>Yarman&apos;s 10-note set for Ushaq and Huseyni, as well as follow an<br/>equal division of the minor third, with possible 17th-century<br/>Ottoman precedents, if/when we&apos;re so inclined.</p><p>Happy New Year,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=105720 href="#105720">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/2012 1:14:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, 31 Dec 2012, Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; first.
