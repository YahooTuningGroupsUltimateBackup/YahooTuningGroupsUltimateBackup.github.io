And this actually seems to lead to a scale&apos;s being &quot;un/non-just&quot; across virtually all dyads as being an advantage...the problem is when a few intervals are very Just and the rest are terribly off just.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A flip side is...at least to me, gearing up my mind to listen to intervals &quot;flip function&quot; in things like 14EDO...is not for the faint of ear...many listeners simply can&apos;t follow it.&nbsp; Personally, I can listen to odd EDO temperaments with some effort in a sitting...but if I listened to them while driving, I would probably lose some concentration and crash my car.<br/>   The other thing is that things like large chords, even with the flipping, seem a lot more accessible in composition in something like 31EDO than 14 and it seems a lot easier to keep the chords sounding balanced (IE not too much consonance or dissonance on the average).</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2011 8:20:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jake&gt; &gt; Someone (Mike?

So, I spent some of my free<br/>time trying to contribute things here about periodicity buzz and<br/>MODMOS&apos;s and the like. At one point, I spent weeks trying to come up<br/>with an optimization for Harmonic Entropy, told everyone that I had it<br/>all figured out, and then discovered I screwed up a single line early<br/>on in the derivation of my optimization that caused weeks of work to<br/>be wasted. I still haven&apos;t fixed that one.</p><p>When I posted stuff, I got critical feedback on it. I didn&apos;t always<br/>like the feedback that I was being given, because I thought that it<br/>was given in an impolite manner. So I resolved to be more polite when<br/>I give feedback.</p><p>In this case, John, who has obviously worked very hard on his formula,<br/>came onto the tuning list and told everyone about his book, titled<br/>&quot;The Mathematics Of Music,&quot; and proclaimed that under his system 6.776<br/>was the maximum threshold of mistuning, that 12-TET couldn&apos;t handle<br/>5-limit harmony, etc. I think that this is absurd because most of the<br/>world uses a tuning system in which most of the intervals are at least<br/>twice as mistuned as that. However, I think his model is headed in an<br/>interesting direction in that it&apos;s a simple average of critical band<br/>dissonance and harmonic complexity, and with a bit of tweaking could<br/>be a useful rule of thumb to evaluate tuning systems and chords<br/>quickly. And I&apos;ve said this a number of times, offered him some<br/>constructive criticism, etc. I do not claim to be perfect, and if my<br/>suggestions were refuted with some kind of logic then I&apos;d have dropped<br/>my suggestions completely and rethought things, which I&apos;ve done<br/>publicly on this list a number of times now.

Likewise, I want to promote what I think is the truth as well,<br/>and make sure that I chime in when I see things being asserted that I<br/>know aren&apos;t true.

But the<br/>point is that I am not Carl, who has not been as polite lately, and I<br/>would like you to not confuse me with him.</p><p>So surely you admit that the criticism that I&apos;m trying to &quot;stifle&quot; or<br/>&quot;censor&quot; anyone is a bit off base. But when somebody claims that<br/>256/255 is a magic interval that happens to be the maximum threshold<br/>of mistuning of any just interval, and says that to newcomers on the<br/>list before they know any different, then I am going to chime in and<br/>claim that it is not.</p><p>&gt; As I mentioned in an earlier post I would not call his investigation &quot;scientific&quot; because the nature of the method has built in bias.

The metric is set up so that higher values represent more<br/>consonant intervals. So we can see that as x*y increases, the<br/>complexity term will go down, meaning the consonance score takes a<br/>hit. Also, we can see that as x/y gets smaller and smaller, into<br/>critical band roughness territory, then y/x gets larger and larger,<br/>asymptotically approaching 1. So the consonance score takes a hit if<br/>the interval is really complex or really small.</p><p>He also flips the calculation such that if the interval is wide<br/>enough, it also takes a hit if it&apos;s too wide, but I glossed over that<br/>at the time. But it&apos;s not really a bad formula in theory, and if a<br/>more sensible mistuning cutoff were picked it would probably be pretty<br/>hand to have around.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/4/2011 1:42:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Apr 4, 2011 at 3:38 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Me&gt; Using Carl&apos;s convention IE sqrt(TH) could improve results further...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene&gt;&quot;How?

The winner is 27EDO with 8 good dyads. In joint second place are 29EDO and 23EDO with 7 good dyads each. Seems like a reasonable proposition that 23EDO should be good.

The former is a<br/>&gt; &gt; statement that applies only to John.

That means it could probably use some tweaking.</p><p>I have given reasons why it&apos;s ridiculous - that the most popular<br/>tuning system in the world doesn&apos;t fit the criteria, that other<br/>popular microtonal systems also don&apos;t fit the criteria (like<br/>19-equal), that any old Joe can test and see that 400 cents is still<br/>heard as 5/4 by playing around with a synth for 5 minutes, that there<br/>hasn&apos;t been any decent explanation given for why 256/255 should be<br/>significant as a mistuning interval. I have said this over and over<br/>and over. I think it has some good points, which I have also said over<br/>and over.</p><p>The suggestion that I have given, and I&apos;ve given it repeatedly now, is<br/>to widen the mistuning cutoff, which is the only possible suggestion<br/>that you could give to improve a system with too strict a mistuning<br/>cutoff. I suggested he possibly experiment with using a mistuning<br/>tolerance value that is not constant but a function of the interval<br/>being judged. I suggested he experiment with weighting the cutoff in<br/>both directions, given Igs&apos; recent suggestion to weight prime error in<br/>the opposite direction to what&apos;s usually done.</p><p>The goal is not, at the end of the day, for everyone to have their own<br/>proprietary theories. The goal is to figure out how music works. John<br/>is free to take my suggestions and improve on them and give me no<br/>credit whatsoever. I simply suggested a way to tweak the formula a<br/>bit. That&apos;s it. Your criticism that my suggestions &quot;are too similar to<br/>the existing theory&quot; is tantamount to saying that my suggestions are<br/>in line with the best information that we currently have on how the<br/>perception of consonance works. That&apos;s hardly a criticism at all.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2011 10:09:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m betting the &quot;order&quot; from best to worst will be similar to Tenney Height in most cases (perhaps with a few exceptions, like 16/11)...but the degree to which such higher limit intervals are worst will be much&nbsp; less than expected by TH.</p><p>There is no way to deduce any such expectations about degrees of badness from TH.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2011 11:32:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Me&gt;&gt; &quot;But I&apos;m unconvinced, for example, that this fact means all theories in the future must match the closest expert theory.&quot;</p><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;All theories in the future should match the results of listening tests. If they don&apos;t, then they don&apos;t accurately represent how music works with human beings.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The new theories must match some sort of listening tests, but NOT past theories: that&apos;s my point.&nbsp; Past theories that are listening tested is not equal to the process of running listening tests on new theories and a new theory can agree with a new listening test without being the same as an old theory that was listening tested.</p><p>&gt;&gt; For example, what pattern in the HE curve explains how Middle<br/>Eastern music (which uses several intervals NOT at HE minima) works?</p><p>&gt;&quot;Uh, it means that discordant intervals can have a use in music?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you slap a sticker saying what&apos;s not low-limit JI must be discordant and don&apos;t question if certain higher-limit intervals can be concordant.&nbsp; I see a nice share of Middle Eastern music theory as a great example, in many cases, of higher limit concordance that Westerners often have simply proven ignorant of and unwilling to, ahem, listening test on fair grounds.&nbsp; Cameron, myself, Igs, and several others have noticed countless times where things like 11/9 and 11/6 can be quite concordant.&nbsp; And don&apos;t even get me started on Igs&apos;s &quot;Map of the Internal Landscape&quot;, an album which threw even my fairly liberal attitude toward many high-limit intervals in a loop.</p><p>&gt;&quot;John&apos;s theory is not listening tested from scratch.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; Listen again, I said &quot; My take: if an &quot;expert theory&quot; does NOT cover the ground of a certain<br/>type of music, this opens the door for new theories, &quot;even&quot; unrelated to<br/> older ones, to cover it...and for those new theories to be listening<br/>tested from scratch.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; This implies we should open theories like John&apos;s FOR TESTING...I never said such theories were tested but, rather, am saying they deserve a fair chance TO be listening tested (and that they should be tested, specifically because they have not been).</p><p>&gt;&quot;Go ahead, and please post the results.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool...I already have a basic 13-or-so-interval survey on the Mechanical Turk (mainly debatable areas like neutral thirds, the area between 7/5 and 8/5, and different types of sevenths) and am just looking for a place to post the sound sample files (all samples done with the same guitar sample...NOT sine waves).</p><p>&nbsp; Does anyone have an ftp directory that translates to a website URL they are willing to open up for this?</p><p>&gt;&quot;I suggested that he improve the 6.776 cent cutoff because IT IS RIDICULOUS. Almost the entire world uses a tuning system that is out of the 6.776 cent cutoff and loves every minute of it.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; True about &quot;the entire world uses...&quot;...and people regularly ALSO accept 18/17-ish semitones when they clearly violate the testing results of P&amp;L&apos;s &quot;scientifically derived&quot; curve and &quot;love every minute of it&quot;.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, typically, I agree with John that around 7 cents or less or error is a &quot;guarantee of safety&quot; for virtually ANY type of interval you are trying to approximate while 14 cents, for example, only seems to work safely for very simple intervals IE 5/4.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp; John&apos;s limit clearly seems to aim for &quot;what can always be considered safe for any interval&quot; rather than &quot;what&apos;s the greatest error that can EVER possibly work...even if it fails with more &apos;unsafe&apos; intervals&quot;.&nbsp; You are obviously trying to solve a different problem than John...no wonder you disagree with his answer.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The goal is not, at the end of the day, for everyone to have their own proprietary theories. The goal is to figure out how music works.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No kidding.&nbsp; So, instead of repeatedly suggesting people change their goals to fit existing theories, or so it seems, why not merely help in the cause of getting together some listening tests?&nbsp; I&apos;m doing one for my theory...why not suggest ideas for doing one for John&apos;s instead of griping how you &apos;know his theory is wrong&apos;?</p><p>&gt;&quot;Your criticism that my suggestions &quot;are too similar to the existing theory&quot; is tantamount to saying that my suggestions are in line with the best information that we currently have on how the perception of consonance works.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we knew how consonance works...we surely wouldn&apos;t have leading musical ambassador&apos;s like Igs and Chris finding gaping exceptions in &apos;leading&apos; theories and surely would have found microtonal scales that work for the average listener and are &quot;anything but just a personal opinion&quot;...eh?&nbsp; But we haven&apos;t....and, rather than sitting around and pretending everything is fine and the theories we have already are near-perfect...IMVHO we should go out and seek new grounds,&nbsp; At least until we do break through.&nbsp; No, this does not mean outright crazy popularity (think &quot;Nickelback&quot;...ugh)...but rather for microtonal music to be as seriously accepted as a household art as any other type of music.&nbsp; We have a lot of work left to do (especially with listening tests on the general public) and little bragging rights with music (we may with math...but mathematicians aren&apos;t necessarily good musicians)...</p></div>
