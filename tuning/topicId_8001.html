I had the great<br/>fortune of being one of composer Otto Luening&apos;s friends at the end of his<br/>life and he was ceaselessly speaking about Busoni.  I think that Busoni was<br/>the influence that drove him into devoting much of his life to electronic<br/>music.  Therefore, it is certainly not surprising that Busoni would be<br/>involved in &quot;alternate&quot; scales and tunings, besides his work as a<br/>transcriber.</p><p>I&apos;m assuming, to follow the comments that Paul Erlich made, that Busoni was<br/>NOT using this 36-EDO system to emulate any kind of &quot;Well Temperament&quot; in<br/>Bach, but only was considering it for his &quot;Musics of the Future&quot;  (??)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
