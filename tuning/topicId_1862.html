The<br/>other countries you mentioned were Mediterranean countries all pretty close<br/>together. My point that we don&apos;t find this type of influence in Afghanistan,<br/>or Iran. The latter I admit is due to its suppression by the government. It is<br/>suprising that more of north Africa has not submitted to western pop. Although<br/>in Algeria at least one of there pop stars were killed.
