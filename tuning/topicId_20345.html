Scala data reveals:  Pseudo Myhill&apos;s Property (I<br/>guess this is the 3 step sizes), is a Winograd Deep Scale (someone<br/>can tell me what that is and I&apos;ll be grateful), and &quot;0&quot; recognizable<br/>fifths (to be expected in Gong spectra - and I&apos;d still like to<br/>understand what is the range that Scala considers a fifth). Anyway,<br/>one must trust little of their biases toward a ratio-centric approach<br/>here, because what we may find true in the area of harmonic timbres,<br/>can have little to do with what sounds best on inharmonic timbres.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>After a bit of deep contemplation of recent discussions with Jeff<br/>Scott on the topic of Non-Octave Scales, and much real-time playing<br/>on my own, to internalize and appreciate the aesthetic qualities of a<br/>wide variety of them, I&apos;ve came to realize that the magic of the Non-<br/>Octave species of microtonal tuning, is that a &quot;stretched&quot;<br/>or &quot;compressed&quot; octave possesses a unique &quot;identity&quot; and sonic<br/>fingerprint that is entirely different than the effect of tunings<br/>with a perfect 2/1 (even with harmonic timbres).  That there is not<br/>the &quot;blending effect&quot; of a &quot;JI 2/1&quot;, but is a subtle or not so subtle<br/>beating at the near &quot;stretched&quot; or &quot;compressed&quot; octave, makes this<br/>kind of tuning have a rare energetic sound all its own, which invites<br/>exciting new kinds of compositional and stylistic thought. The &quot;near-<br/>octaves&quot; are each unique and stand out of the musical texture in a<br/>manner that is alien to JI, but not to Gamelan. For instance, the<br/>tension between an ostinato bass, and a melodic line being played 2<br/>near-octaves above, has a sound of energetic motion because of the<br/>near-octave displacement over the musical range.  Interestingly too,<br/>is that these kinds of tunings are rich with illusions, where<br/>sometimes an interval that is quite wide or narrow of 2/1, will<br/>function aurally as the octave. New harmonies and melodies abound in<br/>this kind of tuning.</p><p>Worth noting too is that there is extensive psychoacoustical evidence<br/>that wide intervals are prefered and even played intuitively in many<br/>cultures around the world (including trained Western orchestral<br/>performers). Discussions with Jeff Scott about his experience in<br/>playing Gamelan music, has shined even more personal light on why the<br/>musical phenomenon of the stretched octave sounds so good. It is the<br/>controlled tuning of beats into the scales that makes the intervals<br/>have this unique identity, which actually helps them to be heard as<br/>distinct in large ensemble settings (a point widely known and<br/>discussed with regard to Gamelan tunings).  This is a wonderful<br/>property to have in a tuning. Hearing the beauty of it, is believing.</p><p>All this is in keeping with my continued quest to use scales which<br/>are complimentary to the spectra of the instruments being used. Even<br/>though there can be great challenges to one&apos;s compositional style,<br/>when on occasion one must make the necessary great leap of using<br/>tuning systems which contain no exact 2/1 relationship, the rewards<br/>of musical beauty are well worth the quest.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>Cents Tables for Scala and Li&apos;l Miss&apos; Scale Oven (LMSO), for quick<br/>tuning:</p><p>19 Tone Non-Octave Scale based on division of 15/8 into 45 parts.</p><p>120.919<br/>193.470<br/>241.837<br/>266.021<br/>314.389<br/>386.940<br/>435.307<br/>507.859<br/>580.410<br/>628.777<br/>701.329<br/>773.880<br/>822.247<br/>894.799<br/>943.166<br/>967.350<br/>1015.717<br/>1088.269<br/>1209.187</p><p>15 Tone Non-Octave Scale from division of the Near-Octave of Gong<br/>Spectra into 29 Parts</p><p>42.724<br/>128.172<br/>256.345<br/>299.069<br/>427.241<br/>512.690<br/>598.138<br/>640.862<br/>726.310<br/>811.759<br/>939.931<br/>982.655<br/>1110.828<br/>1196.276<br/>1239.000</p></div>
