background-color: #eee'><p>Since Tom&apos;s original post about this concerned the music of Handel,<br/>and since i&apos;ve already written before about Partch&apos;s description<br/>of Handel&apos;s 16-tone extended-meantone organ keyboard</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/partch/et/partch-on-et.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/partch/et/partch-on-et.htm</a></p><p>i decided to create a complete interval list of all the<br/>intervals available in Handel&apos;s tuning, using 1/4-comma<br/>meantone.</p><p>(There was discussion of this here years ago when i first<br/>made that webpage ... i don&apos;t recall it now, but it&apos;s in<br/>the list archives for those who want to look ... just be<br/>warned that Partch&apos;s description may not be entirely<br/>accurate.)</p><p>I took the time to make this for several reasons:</p><p>* Handel&apos;s music was much more popular and influential in its<br/>time than Bach&apos;s (with the single exception of the<br/>_Well-Tempered Klavier_);</p><p>* Beethoven admired Handel very much, and considered him<br/>to have been the greatest composer before himself, so there<br/>was probably a strong influence of Handel&apos;s harmonic practice<br/>on Beethoven;</p><p>* in general, &quot;common-practice&quot; harmony is based on the<br/>assumption that notes written according to this set of sharps<br/>and flats would be tuned this way, in practice at least up<br/>to the early Beethoven (c.1800), and in theory all the way<br/>up to c.1900.</p><p>(Hopefully those viewing this on the Yahoo web interface<br/>can see it correctly by clicking the &quot;Option&quot; link which<br/>appears in the upper right under the date, and then clicking<br/>&quot;Use Fixed Width Font&quot;.)</p><p>cents are rounded to the nearest

One, some early 18th century meantone tuning<br/>instructions (eg Keller) indicate tuning with sharp (major) thirds and<br/>suggest that the out-of-tuneness of thirds and fifths should be about<br/>the same. Hence it might conceivably have been nearer 1/5 comma.</p><p>Two, experienced organ tuners will tell you that certain intervals<br/>&apos;draw together&apos; in practice. This means that even if the pipes sounded<br/>separately do not make a pure interval, when played together they can<br/>shift their fundamental frequencies slightly and thus sound pure.<br/>Therefore, even if the organ had been tuned to sound pure thirds, the<br/>individual notes didn&apos;t necessarily fall within 1/4 comma meantone.<br/>The size of the effect depends on the construction of the organ, and<br/>it means that any attempt to theoretically model meantone organ tuning<br/>with precision, even given pure thirds, is doomed.</p><p>Three, the organ did not necessarily allow the player access to all 16<br/>notes at once. As I understand it, there was a lever system which gave<br/>you a variable selection of 12 notes: thus you could not have Db and<br/>G# at the same time, for example, let alone Db-A#.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=68518 href="#68518">ðŸ”—</a>threesixesinarow &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2006 6:06:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; ...Partch&apos;s description of Handel&apos;s 16-tone extended-meantone<br/>&gt; &gt; organ keyboard...</p><p><a href="http://www.music.ed.ac.uk/russell/conference/Gwynnonparker.html">http://www.music.ed.ac.uk/russell/conference/Gwynnonparker.html</a></p><p>Dr. Burney, in his &apos;Sketch of the Life of Handel,&apos;...1785, says, &apos;The<br/>organ in the chapel of this [i.e.the Foundling] hospital was a present<br/>from Handel&apos; But how are we to reconcile this statement with the<br/>following, [European Magazine, Feb. 1799] &apos;Handel did not give the<br/>organ to the Foundling Hospital. It was built at the expense of the<br/>charity, under the direction of Dr. Smith, the learned Master of<br/>Trinity College, Cambridge, who added demitones, &amp;c., and some<br/>niceties not occurring on other organs.&apos;&quot; (Edward F. Rimbault, Notes<br/>and Queries, April 17, 1852)</p><p>Dr. Burney, in his account of the 1784 Commemoration of Handel, when<br/>recording his impressions upon The Messiah performance remarks,<br/>&quot;The favorite bass song, The Trumpet shall sound, was very well<br/>performed by Signor Tasca and Mr. Sarjant. Some passages however in<br/>the trumpet part have always a bad effect from the natural<br/>imperfection of the instrument, The fourth and sixth of a key on<br/>trumpets and French horns are naturally so much out of tune that no<br/>player can make them perfect. These sounds should never be used but in<br/>short passing notes, to which no bass is given that can discover their<br/>false intonation. Mr. Sarjant&apos;s tone is extremely sweet and clear, but<br/>every time he was obliged to dwell upon G, the fourth of D (the key<br/>sound) displeasure appeared in every countenance, for which I was<br/>extremely concerned, knowing how inevitable such an effect must be<br/>from such a cause. In the Halleluha Chorus G, the fourth of the key,<br/>is sustained during two entire bars. In the Dettingen Te Deum, and in<br/>many other places, this false concord or interval perpetually deforms<br/>the fair face of harmony, and indeed the face of almost any one that<br/>hears it, with an expression of pain.&quot;<br/>So wrote Dr. Burney. Now for the truth. The trumpet is a perfect<br/>instrument in respect to all sounds generated from its key sound or<br/>unit. All its harmonics are exquisitely in tune. Hark ! at the seventh<br/>where it comes -- the ratio of 7 to 8 -- how pure and noble it is!<br/>This seventh we never hear on the piano, and only in one or two places<br/>in the old-fashioned organ. From its own innate perfection the trumpet<br/>refuses all unnatural, that is imperfect, sounds or ratios. They are<br/>obtained with great difficulty and heard with disgust. No trumpet can<br/>geenerate the fourth of its key. But the flat fifth is a pure primary<br/>harmonic, and this is the sound trumpet players have to coax or<br/>torture into a fourth. The instrument is not the unnatural wretch Dr.<br/>Burney imagines; it is the instrumentalist who is the evil doer. The<br/>case with the D trumpet stands thus. F sharp, its third, is its 1/5,<br/>5X2=10. A flat is its flat fifth or 1/11. Twice 10 is 20, twice 11,<br/>22. Between comes in 21, which is G natural, not the fourth of D, but<br/>the pure seventh of A. Carry up these ratios once more. Twice 20 is<br/>40, twice 22, 44. Now F sharp is 40, and A flat is 44, so that 41, 42,<br/>and 43 lie between the two sounds. 1/41 of D os a very sharp major<br/>third, a primary harmonic. 42 is the 21 or 7th of A. But G, the root<br/>of D, or rather its octave, stands between 42 and 43. Thus the player<br/>has to coax 44 into 42 1/2 or thereabouts.<br/>(Henry John Gauntlett, Notes and Queries, Sept. 19, 1857)</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3><a id=68519 href="#68519">ðŸ”—</a>threesixesinarow &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/20/2006 6:31:48 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/partch/et/partch-on-et.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/partch/et/partch-on-et.htm</a> Monz wrote,<br/>&quot;It still says in the 1974 edition of Genesis that White&apos;s harmonium<br/>was housed in a practice room at New England Conservatory, and that<br/>Partch examined it in 1943...&quot;</p><p>Number Three, a very compact little instrument of about 3 1/2 octaves<br/>and 195 keys, was made in a few weeks, by using, however, the same<br/>rather home-made old case which Mr. Alden had made in his youth for<br/>Number One.
