The model in question<br/>does not assume octave-equivalence.  This<br/>seems to agree well with experience -- for<br/>example, 7:3 is more concordant than 7:6<br/>which is more concordant than 12:7.</p><p>If one does assume octave-equivalence, in<br/>order to evaluate chords independently of<br/>inversion or octave-repeating tuning<br/>systems, one gets the result that the _odd-<br/>limit_ of a dyad measures its complexity. The<br/>odd limit is the largest odd number in either<br/>the numerator or denominator (after<br/>removing all factors of 2). Then &quot;simple<br/>ratios&quot; in the ideal case are those with odd<br/>limit no greater than 11, and usually much<br/>less. This measure of dissonance agrees<br/>exactly with what Partch puts forward in his<br/>&quot;One-Footed Bride&quot;.</p><p>I came to both of the conclusions above<br/>through the harmonic entropy model (and<br/>lots of listening). If you&apos;d like me to review<br/>how I came to those conclusions, you should<br/>probably go to the<br/><a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@egroups.com">harmonic_entropy@egroups.com</a> list.</p><p>Just to show you why I think your idea<br/>doesn&apos;t work, compare 5:3 and 15:8. If you<br/>remove all powers of two and then multiply<br/>numerator times denominator, you get 15<br/>for both. But 5:3 is clearly much more<br/>consonant than 15:8.</p></div>
