This system is similar to the more familiar 12-tone system of serial composition, but the rows Santini used as the basis of his 21-tone compositions also include all alternative enharmonic spellings for each note in the chromatic scale (except the notes D, G, and A, which have no enharmonic spellings). Thus, the available tones for a 21-tone row would include B-sharp, C, C-sharp, D-flat, D, D-sharp, E-flat, E, F-flat, E-sharp, F, F-sharp, G-flat, G, G-sharp, A-flat, A, A-sharp, B-flat, B, and C-flat.</p><p>There is no menrion of how these pitches are distunguished (or not). Is anybody able to shed some light on this?</p><p>He also used quarter tones in other pieces, so I suspect it is indeed some microtonal system.</p><p>klaus</p></div>
