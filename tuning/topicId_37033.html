Plenty of microtones for 400 5th graders (who create their own work<br/>with us).  Played Handel in quarter comma meantone--showing off the scotch<br/>tape to the kids.  Also intoned &quot;Dream&quot; by Harry Partch with Dave Eggar<br/>(leading &quot;Four on the Floor&quot;).</p><p>What was also clear, besides the enthusiasm and excitement (well it did have<br/>electric cello, electric bass guitar and drum set) was how scared the kids<br/>were.  The text chosen for me to improvise upon was, &quot;My name is James Bond,<br/>and I am proud&quot; and &quot;Where is my gun?&quot;  The kids had these happy faces and<br/>great excitement while saying the darkest and most morbid things.  It was all<br/>about the terrorist threats.  After the two shows (and we still have 4 more<br/>performances), one of the schools canceled as a result of the scares in the<br/>city.</p><p>But hey, this Saturday night at Roulette will be a refuge from the negatives,<br/>a place for good people to chill.  best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
