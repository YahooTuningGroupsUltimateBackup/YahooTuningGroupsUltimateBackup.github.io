Please reply to me only (i.e., not to<br/>the list) so that we don&apos;t clog up the list too much.</p><p>                    <a href="mailto:mr88cet@texas.net">mr88cet@texas.net</a></p><p>I&apos;ll tally up the results and send them to the list after a week or so.</p><p>Questions:</p><p>  1. Do you have the ability to play MP3 files from a web page?<br/>        o Yes<br/>        o No<br/>        o Don&apos;t know<br/>  2. Do you have the ability to play Real Audio files from a web page?<br/>        o Yes<br/>        o No<br/>        o Don&apos;t know<br/>  3. What pretty-good-quality, compressed sound-file format do you believe that<br/>     the most people have the ability to listen to from their web browsers?<br/>        o Real Audio<br/>        o MP3<br/>        o Other (please specify)<br/>        o Don&apos;t know</p><p>Thanks for the opinions!</p><p>I think I asked something somewhat similar over a year ago, but the cyberscape<br/>has changed a lot since then.  I&apos;m hoping to finally get some progress made on<br/>my 88CET web pages, so I&apos;d like to know what sound formats are likely to be<br/>usable for a fairly wide audience.</p></div>
