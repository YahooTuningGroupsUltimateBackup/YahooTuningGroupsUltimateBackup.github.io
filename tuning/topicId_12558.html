This<br/>has lots of moments/events where notes sound deliciously, poignantly<br/>&quot;out-of-tune&quot; (relative to 12Tet);  I wonder if this was what Dan was<br/>getting at;  i.e.  making 12Tet sound &quot;xenharmonic,&quot; if you will, though<br/>staying within its bounds.<br/>Probably, that wasn&apos;t what he meant at all, but at any rate, it seems like<br/>a fascinating piece to check out from a tuning perspective,  due to all of<br/>the play on traditional tonal language (for example, weird-ass<br/>&quot;substitutions&quot; for what might have been run-of-the-mill deceptive<br/>cadences).</p><p>Anyone a fan of this tune?</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div>
