Correcting the spellings<br/>---------------------------</p><p>Reproducing for convenience the quick keyboard diagram from my earlier<br/>post on &quot;comparing notes&quot; for the week, and adding somewhat more<br/>&quot;conventional&quot; spellings for the keys on the upper manual, I will<br/>offer corrected spellings for the cadences I was apparently too<br/>excited and/or tired to get right the first time:</p><p>        381      561               879      1083   1263<br/>      C#&amp;/E@   Eb&amp;/Gb@           F#&amp;/A@    G#&amp;/B@ Bb&amp;/Db@<br/>C&amp;/Eb@     D&amp;/F@      E&amp;/G@ F&amp;/Ab@   G&amp;/Bb@    A&amp;/C@   B&amp;/D@ C&amp;/Eb@<br/> 267        470        675   765      969       1173   1377  1467<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>       114       294               612      816     996<br/>        C#       Eb                F#       G#      Bb<br/> C           D         E      F        G         A       B    C<br/> 0          204       408    498      702       906    1110  1200</p><p>The first style of notation, with the ampersand sign &quot;&amp;&quot; showing a note<br/>raised by a 7:6, reflects how I tend to conceptualize the keyboard when<br/>moving around it. However, a conventional neo-Gothic notation with the<br/>&quot;at&quot; sign &quot;@&quot; showing a note lowered by a comma (here septimal, 64:63<br/>or ~27.26 cents) is also very useful, e.g. D&amp;=F@.</p><p>Recalling a comment on notations by Joseph Pehrson, I might add that<br/>the use of the &quot;@&quot; sign could be interpreted to mean that this tuning<br/>is worth e-mailing home about.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s time for me to get the spellings right for those 7-flavor<br/>cadences on D, and here I&apos;ll give these spellings using both the<br/>Sesquisexta-style notation with &amp; and the conventional neo-Gothic<br/>notation with @.</p><p>In spelling a standard cadence on D, for example as the final or note<br/>of repose in the Dorian mode, I obviously got the two styles of<br/>spelling confused in a curious way -- among other things. Here a major<br/>sixth sonority at 7:9:12 (0-435-933 cents) is expanding to a 2:3:4<br/>trine (0-702-1200 cents) in an intensive manner (ascending melodic<br/>semitones):</p><p>         incorrect spelling[1]               correction<br/>        ----------------------        ------------------------<br/>        E&amp;3-G3-C4 to D&amp;3-A3-D4        E&amp;3-B3-E4 to D&amp;3-A&amp;3-D&amp;4<br/>       (G@3-G3-C4 to F@3-A3-D4)       G@3-B3-E4 to F@3-C@4-F@4</p><p>Similarly, in giving a variation of this cadence where the penultimate<br/>sonority also includes a fifth above the lowest voice for a &quot;full<br/>neo-Gothic quad&quot; of 14:18:21:24 (0-267-702-933 cents), I got the two<br/>spellings confused:</p><p>        incorrect spelling[2]                 correction<br/>     --------------------------      ----------------------------<br/>     E&amp;3-G3-B&amp;-C4  to D&amp;3-A3-D4      E&amp;3-B3-B&amp;3-E4 to D&amp;3-A&amp;3-D&amp;4<br/>    (G@3-G3-C4-C@4 to F@3-A3-D4)     G@3-B3-D@3-E4 to F@3-C@4-F@4</p><p>For people who might be curious about how just how comical my initial<br/>misspellings are, at least for the intended progressions, I&apos;ve added<br/>some footnotes as indicated above.</p><p>Fortunately, I got the spelling right for at least the last example of<br/>a 7-flavor minor seventh sonority at 12:14:18:21 (0-267-702-969 cents)<br/>contracting to a fifth: E3-E&amp;3-B3-B&amp;3 to D&amp;3-A&amp;3., or in conventional<br/>notation, E3-G@3-B3-D@4 to F#<a href="https://twitter.com/3">@3</a>-C#<a href="https://twitter.com/4">@4</a>.</p><p>To clarify the steps in these cadences, I&apos;ll provide more detailed<br/>diagrams below, but first let&apos;s note what may be a rather amazing<br/>facet of these progressions which only occurred to me this morning,<br/>and which I verified at the keyboard. Maybe Johnny Reinhard and John<br/>deLaubenfels may find this especially amusing.</p><p>-------------------------------------<br/>2. A rather large &quot;microtonal&quot; shift?<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>Suppose I want to do a passage with parallel 7:9:12 major sixth<br/>sonorities in D Dorian. Here I find it natural to start with D3-A3-D4,<br/>for example, on the lower keyboard, and then move to my first 7:9:12<br/>by relocating my lower hand only to D&amp;3 (or F@3) on the upper<br/>keyboard. This gives me D&amp;3-A3-D4 (or F@3-A3-D4), with the major third<br/>and sixth a septimal comma wider than Pythagorean, or in other words<br/>at a pure 9:7 and 12:7, just as intended.</p><p>Now, let&apos;s suppose I play a string of parallel 7:9:12 sonorities and<br/>then make a cadence on the mode&apos;s final. In the styles of the 14th and<br/>early 15th centuries, this is generally an _intensive_ cadence, with<br/>the upper voices ascending by semitones and the lower voice descending<br/>by a whole-tone. As my corrected spelling shows, this cadence goes to<br/>a trine the _upper_ manual: E&amp;3-B3-E3 to D&amp;3-A&amp;3-D&amp;4 (or G@3-B3-E3 to<br/>F@3-C@4-F@4).</p><p>When I played it on Monday, it all seemed at once so new and so<br/>natural that I didn&apos;t realize a nuance that occurred to me this<br/>morning in reviewing my spellings: I am starting on D3-A3-D4, and<br/>ending on the _visually_ corresponding D&amp;3-A&amp;3-D&amp;4 on the upper<br/>keyboard -- actually a 7:6 higher! Spelling the latter sonority<br/>conventionally as F@3-C@4-F@4 makes this &quot;shift&quot; more explicit.</p><p>One might say that it took me awhile to &quot;get the drift.&quot;</p><p>Possibly one factor explaining the &quot;natural&quot; quality of this shift or<br/>drift for me is the _literal_ parallelism of the 7:9:12 or other<br/>7-flavor sonorities. This could lead to lots of interesting<br/>ramifications in practice and theory.[3]</p><p>----------------------------------------<br/>3. Cadential progressions in more detail<br/>----------------------------------------</p><p>One way to explore a few features of interval spellings and steps in<br/>the Sesquisexta notation is to consider all four varieties of most<br/>proximate 7-flavor cadences on D -- or, more precisely, on the notes<br/>mapped to the &quot;D&quot; key of either manual as the intensive or remissive<br/>context may indicate. Notes on the upper manual are given both a<br/>Sesquisexta keyboard-style spelling and a more conventional neo-Gothic<br/>spelling:</p><p>                 Expansive 7-flavor quad (14:18:21:24)</p><p>            Intensive                             Remissive</p><p>     E4   ---  +63 --- D&amp;4/F@4              C4    --- +204 --- D4<br/>   (231)                (0)                (231)              (0)<br/>  B&amp;4/D@4 --- -204 --- A&amp;3/C@4            G&amp;4/B@4 ---  -63 --- A3<br/> (498,267)            (702,0)            (498,267)          (702,0)<br/>     B3   ---  +63 --- A&amp;3/C@4              G3    --- +204 --- A3<br/>(933,702,435)      (1200,702,702)      (933,702,435)      (1200,702,702)<br/>  E&amp;3/G@3 --- -204 --- D&amp;3/F@3            C&amp;3/E@3 ---  -63 --- D3</p><p>                 Contractive 7-flavor quad (12:14:18:21)</p><p>            Intensive                                Remissive</p><p>   B&amp;3/D@4 ---  -63 --- A&amp;3/C@4          G&amp;3/Bb@3 ---  -63 --- A3<br/>    (267)                 (0)              (267)              (0)<br/>     B3    --- +204 --- A&amp;3/C@4             G3    --- +204 --- A3<br/>  (498,435)            (702,702)         (498,435)         (702,702)<br/>   E&amp;3/G@3 ---  -63 --- D&amp;3/F@3          C&amp;3/Eb@3 ---  -63 --- D3<br/>(969,702,267)         (702,702,0)      (969,702,267)      (702,702,0)<br/>     E3    ---  +63 --- D&amp;3/F@3             C3    --- +204 --- D3</p><p>In these cadences, ascending or descending whole steps are played in<br/>the usual manner on the same keyboard (e.g. C3-D3, G3-A3, E&amp;3-D&amp;3,<br/>B&amp;3-A&amp;3). This yields a usual Pythagorean step of 9:8 (~203.91<br/>cents).</p><p>Ascending semitones, however, involve moving in visual terms from a<br/>note on the lower keyboard to one appearing a whole-tone _down_ on the<br/>upper keyboard: e.g. B3-A&amp;3, E3-D&amp;4 (see intensive cadences). What is<br/>happening here is that the motion in the &quot;horizontal&quot; dimension brings<br/>us down by a 204-cent whole-tone, but the &quot;vertical&quot; motion to the<br/>upper manual takes us up by a 267-cent minor third -- so that the net<br/>effect of (267 - 204) cents is to ascend by a 7-flavor semitone of<br/>28:27 or ~62.96 cents.</p><p>We can also spell these semitone motions as B3-C@4 and E3-F@4, showing<br/>that they are indeed a septimal comma smaller than Pythagorean, or<br/>28:27.</p><p>For descending 7-flavor semitones, we move from the lower to the upper<br/>manual while visually _descending_ by a whole-tone, a net motion of<br/>(204 - 267) cents or 63 cents down. The remissive cadences above<br/>provide examples: C&amp;3-D3, G&amp;3-A3. The spellings E@3-D3 and B@3-A3<br/>again confirm that these semitones are a septimal comma narrower than<br/>Pythagorean.</p><p>The frequent tendency to associate &quot;visually equivalent&quot; notes or<br/>vertical centers on the two manuals which are actually a 7:6 apart may<br/>have various artistic potentials, especially if one follows Ivor<br/>Darreg&apos;s advice not to let the niceties of spelling get in the way of<br/>making good music.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. As my more conventional notation may suggest, E&amp;3-G3-C4 or<br/>G@3-G3-C4 would actually represent a sonority of 0-27-525 cents, with<br/>the lower pair of voices E&amp;3-G3 or G@3-G3 at a 27-cent septimal comma,<br/>and the outer voices at a fourth of G@3-C4, a septimal comma wide,<br/>256:189 or ~525.31 cents. This isn&apos;t to exclude such a sonority, only<br/>to recognize that it is distinct from the intended 7:9:12. Obviously I<br/>was juxtaposing new and more familiar spellings in a curious fashion.<br/>The goal of this standard resolution from the intended E&amp;3-B3-E4<br/>should be D&amp;3-A&amp;3-D&amp;4; my given notation D&amp;3-A3-D4 would produce<br/>another 7:9:12 sonority. One could, of course, end a phrase or section<br/>on D&amp;3-A3-D4; in conventional neo-Gothic style this would be a kind of<br/>&quot;half-cadence,&quot; possibly inviting an eventual resolution to<br/>C&amp;3-G&amp;3-C&amp;4 (intensive) or E3-B3-E3 (remissive).</p><p>2. For this version, E&amp;3-G3-B&amp;3-C4 or G@3-G3-D@4-C4 -- in order of<br/>ascending pitches, E&amp;3-G3-C4-B&amp;4 or G@3-G3-C4-D@4 -- would actually<br/>represent a sonority of 0-27-525-702 cents. We have a narrow fifth at<br/>189:128 or ~674.69 cents at G3-B&amp;3 or G3-D@4, and the small whole-tone<br/>C4-B&amp;4 or C4-D@4 at 567:512 or ~176.65 cents, in addition to the three<br/>intervals of the E&amp;3-G3-C4 sonority discussed in the previous note,<br/>and the usual fifth E&amp;3-B&amp;3 or G@3-D@4.</p><p>3. Should one wish to take a more conventional approach to pitch<br/>levels, what I might term 64:63 &quot;exchange vectors&quot; from one keyboard<br/>to the other are available for any note on the upper manual with a<br/>regularly spelled minor third above, as the alternate spellings<br/>indicate. For example, E&amp;3/G@3 is a septimal comma below G3, the note<br/>on the lower keyboard _visually_ a minor third higher. Thus if one<br/>starts on D3-A3-D4 and wishes to conclude a phrase in parallel 7:9:12<br/>sonorities with a standard intensive cadence to the nearest<br/>corresponding pitch on the upper manual. one could use the progression<br/>C#&amp;3-G3-C3 to B&amp;2-F#&amp;3-B&amp;3, i.e. E@3-G3-C4 to D@3-A@3-D@4, only a<br/>septimal comma below the starting pitch of D. Conversely, any note on<br/>the lower keyboard with a regularly spelled minor third _below_ it has<br/>an exchange vector with a note on the upper keyboard a septimal comma<br/>lower, in this example D3 to B&amp;2/D@3. The &quot;odd&quot; keys without exchange<br/>vectors are C#, F#, and G# on the lower keyboard; and Eb/Gb@, Bb/Db@,<br/>and F/Ab@ on the upper keyboard. While one _can_ use exchange vectors<br/>to seek corresponding pitch levels, whether one _should_ do in a given<br/>context is a matter of artistic judgment, with people&apos;s preferences in<br/>different musical contexts a fascinating open question.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=23238 href="#23238">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/19/2001 4:51:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22976.html#22976">/tuning/topicId_22976.html#22976</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;                  Expansive 7-flavor quad (14:18:21:24)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             Intensive<br/>Remissive<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      E4   ---  +63 --- D&amp;4/F@4              C4    --- +204 --- D4<br/>&gt;    (231)                (0)                (231)              (0)<br/>&gt;   B&amp;4/D@4 --- -204 --- A&amp;3/C@4            G&amp;4/B@4 ---  -63 --- A3<br/>&gt;  (498,267)            (702,0)            (498,267)          (702,0)<br/>&gt;      B3   ---  +63 --- A&amp;3/C@4              G3    --- +204 --- A3<br/>&gt; (933,702,435)      (1200,702,702)      (933,702,435)<br/>(1200,702,702)<br/>&gt;   E&amp;3/G@3 --- -204 --- D&amp;3/F@3            C&amp;3/E@3 ---  -63 --- D3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                  Contractive 7-flavor quad (12:14:18:21)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             Intensive<br/>Remissive<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    B&amp;3/D@4 ---  -63 --- A&amp;3/C@4          G&amp;3/Bb@3 ---  -63 --- A3<br/>&gt;     (267)                 (0)              (267)              (0)<br/>&gt;      B3    --- +204 --- A&amp;3/C@4             G3    --- +204 --- A3<br/>&gt;   (498,435)            (702,702)         (498,435)         (702,702)<br/>&gt;    E&amp;3/G@3 ---  -63 --- D&amp;3/F@3          C&amp;3/Eb@3 ---  -63 --- D3<br/>&gt; (969,702,267)         (702,702,0)      (969,702,267)<br/>(702,702,0)<br/>&gt;      E3    ---  +63 --- D&amp;3/F@3             C3    --- +204 --- D3<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hello Margo!</p><p>Just to prove the &quot;authority&quot; that the new age and e-mail has<br/>assumed, it should be recorded that your recent post on progressions<br/>is illegible from Yahoo on the Web.</p><p>Hopefully, people receiving the e-mail versions (which I do *not*<br/>presently get) will have the notations correct.</p><p>Your post truncates EVERY SINGLE instance where you use the &quot;&amp;&quot; sign,<br/>and is completely illegible from the web...</p><p>I am very sorry to report this, but perhaps a posting with some other<br/>indicator might be appropriate, since then Web viewers can at least<br/>try to realize your drift!</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>__________ ________ _______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
