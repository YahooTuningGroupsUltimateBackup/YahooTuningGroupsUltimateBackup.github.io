However,<br/>this does not mean that instrumental music was inconsequential, or<br/>that its influence on vocal intonations was necessarily negligible.</p><p>Mark Lindley, for example, argues with due caution that the new<br/>modified Pythagorean tunings of the early 15th century, possibly<br/>sometimes implemented on keyboards with more than 12 notes per octave,<br/>may have influenced the vocal writing of composers such as Dufay,<br/>intriguing them with the sound of nearly pure schisma thirds involving<br/>written sharps.</p><p>Lindley also shows how, around 1400-1450, keyboard sources such as the<br/>Italian Faenza Codex and the German Buxheimer Organ Book used<br/>prominent sonorities with schisma thirds as a very popular &quot;special<br/>effect,&quot; indeed sometimes a &quot;stock in trade,&quot; as he puts it. While the<br/>&quot;explosion&quot; in lute and keyboard tablatures around 1500 was yet to<br/>come, these trends may have played a role in the stylistic change<br/>around 1420-1450 which marked what Tinctoris (1477) regarded as the<br/>beginning of truly &quot;modern&quot; music. In current historical terms, this<br/>is often regarded as the Gothic/Renaissance transition.</p><p>While the formal vocal forms of sacred and secular polyphony continued<br/>to hold center stage in the 16th century, instrumental forms played a<br/>very important role also, and madrigals, for example, might be<br/>sometimes be performed by mixed consorts of voices and instruments. In<br/>fact, the complications and conflicts resulting from such mixed<br/>ensembles (e.g. meantone keyboards and 12-tone equal temperament or<br/>12-tet lutes) was one topic of discussion in late 16th-century<br/>treatises.</p><p>During the first half of the 16th century, an incredible flowering of<br/>instrumental forms occurred, ranging from dances and improvisatory<br/>lute and keyboard preludes to Willaert&apos;s ensemble _ricarcare_. By<br/>1555, Vicentino was prepared to advocate the use of his 31-tet<br/>_archicembalo_ as a standard for intonation by singers.</p><p>In discussing either the 3-limit JI of the Gothic era or the 5-limit<br/>JI of the Renaissance, it may be helpful to remember that these are<br/>_ideals_ of intonation, guiding singers of some natural variability in<br/>their intervals. In performances involving mixed voices and<br/>instruments, common for example in the various Florentine<br/>entertainments chronicled by Howard Mayer Brown, instrumental and<br/>vocal intonations would interact, making the former not irrelevant.</p><p>As early as 1516, by which year Castiglione&apos;s _Courtier_ is said to<br/>have been completed (it was published in 1528), an author argues that<br/>the most pleasing court music is a vocal solo accompanied by the<br/>_viola a mano_ -- that is, actually, a lute or similar plucked<br/>instrument. Various Italian _frottole_ around 1500 may have performed<br/>in this manner, and arrangements of Italian madrigals by Verdelot, for<br/>example, for the lute may have represented a continuation of this<br/>tradition.</p><p>This is not at all to minimize the importance of the view taken by<br/>various theorists of the later 16th century that there are three<br/>distinct types of intonation: (1) Just intonation for voices,<br/>specifically 5-limit; (2) Meantone for keyboards; and (3) 12-tet for<br/>lutes. However, in forms where these varieties of instruments (the<br/>voice being considered the most &quot;perfect&quot;) interacted, mutual<br/>influence or accommodation might come into play.</p><p>The influence of instrumental intonations in practice is suggested by<br/>Vicentino, who describes the conventional practice of his time as<br/>&quot;mixed and tempered music.&quot; The &quot;mixed&quot; refers to his view that even<br/>compositions typically classified as &quot;diatonic&quot; in fact use elements<br/>of the chromatic and enharmonic genera; and the &quot;tempered&quot; evidently<br/>refers to the kind of accommodations made in meantone tunings for<br/>keyboard.</p><p>Because the topic of the Pythagorean-Aristoxenian-Ptolemaic debate is<br/>often raised here, I would like to conclude with one point about at<br/>least the late medieval theorists of polyphony and Pythagorean<br/>tuning. This really isn&apos;t addressed to any one previous article in<br/>particular, but maybe to a general trend of thought.</p><p>In medieval versions of the Pythagoras story, this theorist heard an<br/>amazingly harmonious striking of blacksmith&apos;s hammers, and the set out<br/>to investigate how this could come about. Such curiosity led to<br/>experimentation, and the discovery of the ratios of the principal<br/>concords. Thus the sense of hearing and the intellect are partners in<br/>the kind of theorizing advocated by Pythagoreans such as Jacobus of<br/>Liege: concord and discord themselves are described in terms of<br/>smoothly blending or roughly &quot;colliding&quot; sounds, as well as in terms<br/>of numerical ratios.</p><p>Further, to such medieval theorists, concord/discord classifications<br/>reflect style as well as mathematics. For Jacobus, while _stable_<br/>concords are generally limited to the classic 3-(odd)-limit intervals,<br/>a variety of other intervals are also recognized as &quot;medial&quot; or<br/>&quot;imperfect&quot; concords. These include the major third (81:64), minor<br/>third (32:27), major second (9:8), minor seventh (16:9), and major<br/>sixth (27:16). Not all of these ratios are mathematically so tidy, but<br/>Jacobus hears the intervals as more or less blending, and so describes<br/>them as &quot;concordant&quot; to various degrees.</p><p>Possibly the hallmark of &quot;Pythagoreanism&quot; in such a medieval setting<br/>is a desire to explain artistic perceptions in a precisely quantitized<br/>way -- something rather different from considering such perceptions<br/>irrelevant. Thus in the early 15th century, Prosdocimus portrays his<br/>fellow Paduan theorist Marchettus of about a century earlier as a very<br/>bad mathematician, but a good practical musician. In fact, without<br/>necessarily joining with Prosdocimus in his value judgment, one can<br/>say that the mathematics of Marchettus are at best a bit unclear, as<br/>compared with the 17-note Pythagorean scheme of the later theorist.</p><p>Further, as Prosdocimus shows, it is quite possible to champion a<br/>Pythagorean approach to intonation while showing an awareness of the<br/>role of perception. Thus, having recognized the distinction between<br/>intervals such as A3-F#4 (major sixth, 27:16) and A3-Gb4 (diminished<br/>seventh, 32768:19683), he wonders aloud whether this distinction might<br/>be &quot;imperceptible&quot; to the ear.</p><p>In my view, our answer might depend on how &quot;perceptible&quot; is<br/>interpreted. Certainly it is possible for an attuned listener to<br/>discern this difference of a Pythagorean comma (~23.46 cents), but at<br/>the same time, one might guess that in the early 15th century, as now,<br/>many listeners might find either interval an acceptable representative<br/>of the &quot;major sixth&quot; class. Indeed, keyboard works of the period which<br/>in popular keyboard tunings would use both flavors of sixths lend<br/>support to this view.</p><p>Here I wish not at all to minimize the importance of our ongoing<br/>dialogue regarding the traditions of Pythagorus, Ptolemy, and<br/>Aristoxenes, only to caution against any blanket equation of<br/>&quot;Pythagorean&quot; theory during the medieval period with an indifference<br/>to the evidence of the senses or to the vital dynamics of style.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
