Like I said, it took two months to write the<br/>&apos;Juggler&apos;. Brahms woke up, wrote a fugue with his danish and coffe, and got started<br/>on real work (say, the 4th symphony). Prolific I am not.

The CSOUND piece is a different &apos;me&apos;...an algorithmic, lazier me. I like it,<br/>but I almost can&apos;t take credit for it, because &apos;Cecilia&apos;, the CSOUND algorithmic<br/>front-end, did most of the work. The pop piece was edited algorithmic chaos.

Well, if I could be so bold, I&apos;ll suggest you&apos;re relying a bit too much on the harpsichord sound.  There are a lot of quite-good sounds in the unit, and the best way to impress is to use a good variety of them.  Also have some expressiveness through the key velocities (see the &quot;16: ChorusClav&quot; and  &quot;34:Slappin&apos;&quot; for how this might work).</p><p>But yes, it&apos;s a good piece, and does improve on repeated listening.  Not that you&apos;ll have Beethoven worried -- plenty more work to do there.</p><p>I used to write my own binary files in hex, and then convert them into MIDI files using a Fortran program.  That was a very convoluted way of working, so you&apos;re two steps ahead of where I was.  It does mean you have to work slowly, but the results can be good because you have to think about what you&apos;re doing.  And it removes the temptation to extend pieces beyond what the material allows.  Still, I much prefer working with tunable real-time synths and a sequencer.</p><p>&gt;Anyone who runs Python on Linux, and wants the scripts, give me a holler. &gt;  &gt;<br/>Yes, could be interesting.

There are a lot of quite-good sounds in the<br/>&gt; unit, and the best way to impress is to use a good variety of them.<br/>&gt; Also have some expressiveness through the key velocities (see the &quot;16:<br/>&gt; ChorusClav&quot; and  &quot;34:Slappin&apos;&quot; for how this might work).</p><p>I think we have slightly different units....I thought I recognized those<br/>cheezy-named patches, but I have only variants of them, like &apos;slap bass 1&apos;, etc.- at<br/>least the &apos;A bank&apos; ones I haven&apos;t erased because I wanted to replace the least<br/>likely to use sounds with ones of my own creation.....</p><p>But, to justify my choices....really, the work was conceptually an acoustic<br/>instrument conception which was realized on a sampler type instrument because<br/>that&apos;s the easiest way to hear a 19-tet recorder and harpsichord piece.....</p><p>Since real harpsichords with one rank and no stop do not have dynamic gradation,<br/>I didn&apos;t even think twice about avoiding key velocity variation, although I did use a<br/>bit here and there with the recorder.</p><p>As a rule, I shy away from late 80&apos;s type sampler synth or overly glassy or digital<br/>sounding synth sounds-just my personal taste. They make me think of Bon Jovi or<br/>bad 80&apos;s &apos;hair metal&apos; bands, and the association is one that I want to avoid at all<br/>costs. I don&apos;t even want to satirize it!</p><p>&gt; But yes, it&apos;s a good piece, and does improve on repeated listening.  Not<br/>&gt; that you&apos;ll have Beethoven worried -- plenty more work to do there.</p><p>If I&apos;ve got Beethoven worried, he&apos;s both overly generous and underly esteeming<br/>himself ! ;)</p><p>&gt; I used to write my own binary files in hex, and then convert them into<br/>&gt; MIDI files using a Fortran program.  That was a very convoluted way of<br/>&gt; working, so you&apos;re two steps ahead of where I was.  It does mean you<br/>&gt; have to work slowly, but the results can be good because you have to<br/>&gt; think about what you&apos;re doing.  And it removes the temptation to extend<br/>&gt; pieces beyond what the material allows.  Still, I much prefer working<br/>&gt; with tunable real-time synths and a sequencer.</p><p>I Agree. I would also say that the compositional discipline to over-extend or<br/>over-write can be a problem in any medium. I have found, in my time doing this,<br/>that a first draft is better than no draft, and we can always cut and edit and paste,<br/>etc. It&apos;s rare to have a piece come out perfectly finished in one draft (at least it&apos;s<br/>rare for me). Anyway, I echo that thinking about what you&apos;re doing is best !!</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2003 9:55:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;akj@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/46900">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/46900</a></p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; ***Well I hasten to add that the other pieces on your page<br/>weren&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; quite up to &quot;Juggler&quot; standards, and it also doesn&apos;t seem that<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;ve really written all that much music as yet, unless I&apos;m<br/>missing<br/>&gt; &gt; something... ;)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Joseph<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, you&apos;re not :) - I&apos;ve written 20 minutes of electric<br/>guitar/piano music in 12-tet, a<br/>&gt; Piano Toccata, countless songs which I now consider juvenalia,<br/>some atonal-funk<br/>&gt; band music, sketches, exercises, countless throwaway algorithmic<br/>experiments,<br/>&gt; and the pieces on my web page.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, &apos;Juggler&apos; stands for sure as one of my best - and I agree<br/>that the other pieces<br/>&gt; are not as up there - although I quite like them anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW, Joseph, I love your mp3 page...I&apos;ve been familiar with a lot<br/>of names for<br/>&gt; years doing Google searches for microtonalists...yours come up<br/>quite a lot.<br/>&gt; Especially loved &apos;Hexy&apos;...its tremendously colorful and &apos;alien&apos;<br/>and &apos;off kilter&apos; in a<br/>&gt; sort-of &apos;spaced-out funhouse&apos;  way...words fail.

Does anyone know the actual quote?<br/>It&apos;s from his<br/>&gt; lectures......<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Aaron.</p><p>***Hi Aaron,</p><p>I can easily &quot;second&quot; what you are saying here, particularly in<br/>your &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; section.</p><p>For a while, at the beginning of my explorations of the &quot;Blackjack&quot;<br/>scale, I was using Paul&apos;s lattice literally to plot &quot;common tone&quot;<br/>harmonies.</p><p>I was able to make some pretty decent pieces this way, I think, but I<br/>was working &quot;against&quot; the plotted harmonics, which were<br/>somewhat &quot;stiff&quot; and contrived.</p><p>Now I am working more in a &quot;free&quot; way with the lattice.  I just go<br/>for the sounds that I *hear* and then try to figure out what is going<br/>on afterward.  (Sometimes I adjust the &quot;afterward&quot; consciously to<br/>increase my intended effect...)</p><p>I think that&apos;s somewhat what Stravinsky was talking about.<br/>Unfortunately I can&apos;t find the quote here.</p><p>Joseph</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2003 11:29:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;akj@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m writing too long, mainly cause I&apos;m thinking out loud here...</p><p>not at all, thanks for sharing your thoughts!</p><p>&gt;but it also seems to<br/>&gt; me that if I think too much about what I want to write, instead of<br/>&gt;listening to that<br/>&gt; constant, organic stream of sonic events in my head, and flirting<br/>&gt;with it, I am less<br/>&gt; successful, i.e. the pieces don&apos;t have an immediacy to them.</p><p>q.v. my recent remarks on the metatuning list . . .</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2003 8:46:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;akj@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hello all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d love your feedback on my new work &apos;The Juggler&apos;, available as<br/>an mp3 file from:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.aaronandlorna.com/audio/juggler.mp3">http://www.aaronandlorna.com/audio/juggler.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a 19-tet composition.</p><p>Wow--I&apos;m very impressed.
