Despite your paragraph here, I think you have<br/>been looking in the right places, those being what is appropriate for<br/>the melody and harmony of the moment.</p><p>9/7, even for a leading tone, seems a bit more sharp than I would expect.<br/>I&apos;d be more inclined to think pythagorean, which is only 8 cents sharper<br/>from just than 12tet. Heres a few different leading tones, the first is<br/>based on 9/7, the second is pythagorean, for those who like primes and<br/>overtones then &quot;the 11/8 of the 11/8&quot; is almost deadon to 12tet, and<br/>the last two are a pair of &quot;next overtone&quot; from 15/8.</p><p>ratio    27/14   243/128  121/64  61/32  31/16<br/>cents     1137    1110     1103    1117   1145</p><p>of course, 36/19 is also a nice leading tone at 1106 cents (and comes<br/>from the classic 38:48:57 triad...)
