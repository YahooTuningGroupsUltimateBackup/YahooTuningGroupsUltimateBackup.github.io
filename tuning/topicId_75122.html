(So much<br/>for trusting electronic samples, eh?  I don&apos;t trust speakers.)  I<br/>tested again on my harpsichord that was already set in 1/6 from<br/>yesterday&apos;s practice session.  I even moved the 1/6 comma tempered D<br/>up (just now) to where it&apos;s really at 16:9 below the C and 5:2 below<br/>the F#.  No noticeable beats, playing all three notes together; only a<br/>dead-on starkly resonant chord D-C-F#.  It&apos;s the same chord I hear,<br/>only with no fundamental played, if I merely play the C and F#<br/>together.  The C and F# have that same ringing purity together whether<br/>the D is played or not below them, or a D between them either.</p><p>Look, Paul, I think your assertions here are overboard.

You somehow have complete and<br/>omniscient knowledge of everybody else&apos;s perception, while you<br/>discount mine as the only one that&apos;s invalid?  You&apos;re also arrogating<br/>to yourself the only sense of the word pure/purity that makes sense TO<br/>YOU, which apparently is the coincidence of upper partials.  Is it<br/>absolutely impossible that other people, including me, may hear<br/>somewhat differently from you, or describe a &quot;pure&quot; effect in a way<br/>that you happen not to hear?  And is it possible that any 18th century<br/>people in THEIR assertions of pure/rein ever meant things other than<br/>the coincidence of upper partials?</p><p>Your assertion &quot;while Brad thought he was hearing the above, what he<br/>actually heard was this&quot; is also pretty presumptuous...and incorrect.<br/> How do you presume to know what &quot;Brad thought&quot;?

Brad therefore thinks there&apos;s something<br/>impure going on in there...but not nearly to the unsubtle extent of<br/>your second sample.</p><p>I do agree with your point about hearing a language and dropouts in a<br/>noisy situation such as a crowded restaurant, but (through experience)<br/>being able to fill in most of the gaps and get through a task.  Last<br/>night when I was tuning for the gig, by ear of course, the organizers<br/>of the concert were making a ridiculous racket for 20 minutes sliding<br/>150 wooden chairs across a wooden floor while I tried to tune.  I<br/>stopped and waited a number of times, but time was so short that I had<br/>to proceed anyway.  As you surely know, wooden chairs and banging<br/>doors are even worse than people talking near a harpsichord during a<br/>tuning effort, as they eat up all the beats with their own pitched<br/>racket.</p><p>It worked out well last night anyway, but the tuning took me about 25<br/>instead of the 12 I was expecting to do.

Brad said, he heard a tempered version, when in<br/>fact Brad was listening to a pure version. It&apos;s a construction in<br/>English, which is used to indicate that a person is incorrect, and<br/>that what they stated was the case was in fact NOT the case; it<br/>doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m crawling inside Brad&apos;s head and interpreting his<br/>thoughts. Come on, Brad! I don&apos;t have to tell you stuff like this.<br/>It&apos;s a waste of our time for you to pretend to be offended because I<br/>simply phrased what you yourself said in another way. You were just<br/>wrong, admit it and be done with it.</p><p>&gt;  Brad heard beats in<br/>&gt; your recording.  Brad still hears beats in your recording, on the<br/>&gt; computer speakers here.  Brad therefore thinks there&apos;s something<br/>&gt; impure going on in there.</p><p>Brad&apos;s either got a hearing problem (water on the ear) or bad audio<br/>equipment. I do hear the extremely rapid beats caused by all the<br/>frequencies adding up, but they are so fast that I would say they are<br/>well into the zone of what Helmholtz called &quot;roughness&quot; than the sort<br/>of undulations which are usually called beats. Of course what Brad<br/>might mean by &quot;beats&quot; could be anything, since he doesn&apos;t seem to want<br/>to adhere to normal meanings of any words.</p><p>&gt;   Last<br/>&gt; night when I was tuning for the gig, by ear of course, the organizers<br/>&gt; of the concert [snip]<br/>&gt; It worked out well last night anyway, but the tuning took me about 25<br/>&gt; [snip snip snip]  My usual.<br/>&gt; The violinist matched his G-D-A-E to the tempered 5ths of the hpsi, as<br/>&gt; he usually does, and he played beautifully and well in tune.  He hears<br/>&gt; very well, having apprenticed for a while as an organ voicer.</p><p>Interesting how whenever Brad gets into boggy ground, he always trots<br/>out yet another story about some event where Brad&apos;s amazing tuning<br/>ability saved the day and the musical performance was wonderful and<br/>everybody played like never before. Ho-hum. Doesn&apos;t prove anything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Is there only one correct way to hear?</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t know what the concept &quot;correct way to hear&quot; might be.<br/>Acoustically, there are things which are there to be heard, there are<br/>things which are there which can&apos;t be heard, and there are things<br/>which simply don&apos;t exist. It&apos;s that simple. Now there are those who<br/>can&apos;t hear things which are there to be heard, through a lack of<br/>training, experience, or ability. There are also those who hear things<br/>which are not actually there, just as there are those who see things<br/>which are not actually there.</p><p>&gt; The way that non-human devices can measure into numbers and graphs?<br/>&gt; Devices that don&apos;t understand even one iota of Baroque music or its<br/>&gt; melodic or harmonic characteristics, or the way it moves?</p><p>If and when you can posit any sort of explanation for this mysterious<br/>acoustic phenomenon, I will gladly consider it. However, you have<br/>consistently and repeatedly failed to so, except falling back on the<br/>empty assertion that if we only understood Baroque music as it was<br/>understood in the 18th century, we would certainly hear it, too.</p><p>Frankly, I think you&apos;re leading us all down the rosy path, and the<br/>rose garden has just been given a fresh treatment of the finest manure.</p><p>Happy Trails,</p><p>P</p></div>
