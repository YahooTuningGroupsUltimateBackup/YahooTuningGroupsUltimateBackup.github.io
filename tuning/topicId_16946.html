Or maybe I should say, Is<br/>there any relation to the frequency of a specific &quot;tone&quot; and the<br/>frequency of a specific color?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In other words, If the color green were to make a sound, what musical<br/>&quot;tone&quot; would it be?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Thanks for your time<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Walter Lepore<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dr. James Lochner said:<br/>Walter,</p><p>  Interesting question.</p><p>  Light has frequency just as sound does.  This is by virtue of the<br/>fact that both are waves.  The frequencies of a particular sound wave<br/>and a particular light wave are determined by their respective speeds.</p><p>Since the speed of light is so much larger than the speed of sound,<br/>you get some astounding numbers.</p><p>  The frequency of green light is about 5.45 x 10^14 cps (that&apos;s<br/>545 trillion cps).  I&apos;m not a music expert, so you&apos;d have to figure<br/>out what tone that would be.</p><p>  I hope this helps</p><p>Jim Lochner<br/>Imagine the Universe!</p></div><h3><a id=17094 href="#17094">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2001 12:06:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16946">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16946</a></p><p>&gt;    Hey Wally...I&apos;d love to see the chat with the<br/>&gt; astrophysicist...perhaps it would be of interest to the list, or<br/>post me<br/>&gt; privately...this is an area that&apos;s very important to<br/>&gt; me...thanks...Hstick</p><p>Unless I&apos;m mistaken, I believe this whole issue of the &quot;teeny-tiny&quot;<br/>intervals &quot;way out&quot; on the harmonic series came up with reference to<br/>calling music created exclusively with the overtone series &quot;Just<br/>Intonation.&quot;</p><p>I believe in our discussions with David Keenan, Paul Erlich and<br/>others, it was pretty much determined that the harmonic series<br/>definition did not hold water (or sound).</p><p>Since the upper partials become infinitely small, there was always a<br/>possibility of creating practically ANYTHING with them, including<br/>12-tET, or our &quot;infamous&quot; Hammond organ.
