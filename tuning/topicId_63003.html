Easley Blackwood&apos;s notation uses a chain of fifths, but since this closes to a circle of 5 fifths in 15-ET and other multiples of 5 (up to 30-ET), this results in having two different names for the same note, if all seven notes are used.</p><p>D..E..G..A..C..D<br/>..(F)......(B)..</p><p>Now this is a reasonable notation, and works out well if you&apos;re using Blackwood&apos;s decatonic scale. But fifths aren&apos;t necessarily the best intervals to use as a basis for 15-ET notation; 15-ET has better minor thirds than fifths. If you notate 15-ET with a chain of minor thirds (E# G# B D F Ab Cb), and set the size of a sharp or flat to one step of 15-ET, you end up with a porcupine notation.</p><p>D.E.F.G..A.B.C.D</p><p>So I began to think: what would happen if you use a notation based on major or minor thirds (whichever is better) for those ET&apos;s that don&apos;t work out well using a chain of fourths or fifths? I tried this out on 16-ET and ended up with:</p><p>D..EF..G.A..BC..D</p><p>Which, oddly enough, is the same as Blackwood&apos;s notation for 16-ET. I used a chain of major thirds this time, but I suspect (from the liner notes of his CD) that Blackwood may have used the circle of minor thirds that 16-ET shares with 12-ET. As I tried more of these notations, it became apparent that if you set the sizes of the sharps correctly, a chain of minor thirds often works out to be the same notation as a chain of major thirds. So these are two classes of notations: third-based notations and fourth-based notations. 17-ET works out well with a fourth-based notation.</p><p>D..EF..G..A..BC..D</p><p>While a third-based notation looks like a good possibility for 23-ET (as an alternative to the mavila-based notation).</p><p>D...E.F...G..A...B.C...D</p><p>Some tunings such as 32-ET have both of these.</p><p>D.....EF.....G.....A.....BC.....D (fourth-based)<br/>D.....E.F.....G...A.....B.C.....D (third-based)</p><p>There also seem to be some ET&apos;s that work best with a notation based on major seconds, such as 18-ET.</p><p>D..E.F..G.A..B.C..D</p><p>Now, one thing I&apos;ve noticed about all these notations is that they have two symmetrical tetrachords. DE, FG, AB, and CD are always the same size of step, and EF is the same size as BC. GA can be the same size as EF and BC (as in 18-ET), the same size as the other large steps (as in the diatonic scale), an intermediate size (as in 23-ET), or larger than the other two step sizes.

This seems to me to be both<br/>cumbersome and &quot;unnatural&quot;.  Ideally, I would<br/>think, a more useful notation for any n-EDO<br/>tuning would have either:</p><p>a)  One nominal for each of the n tuning steps,</p><p> - or -</p><p>b)  One nominal for each scale degree of an<br/>m-note scale drawn from the n-EDO, where<br/>the value of m is not less than half of n,</p><p> - or -</p><p>c)  One nominal roughly corresponding to each<br/>&quot;standard&quot; nominal, and enough distinct signs<br/>for intermediate accidentals to keep the<br/>notation compact.</p><p>I think c) is probably the best approach.</p><p>The most familiar example of b) is of course<br/>a 7-note diatonic scale drawn from 12-EDO.<br/>The reason I suggested b) is that it&apos;s more<br/>practical than one that potentially requires<br/>multiple accidentals in a proper key signature;<br/>in particular,<br/>1) multiple accidentals are tedious to write,<br/>2) multiple accidentals are harder to read, and<br/>3) key signatures would be nightmares!</p><p>Imagine, for example, you&apos;ve been cheerfully<br/>modulating through a chain of keys rooted on<br/>successive fifths.  In 32-EDO, we have these<br/>notes:<br/> D.....E.F.....G...A.....B.C.....D<br/>which you proposed we notate as:<br/> D, D#, D##, D###=Ebbb, Ebb, Eb, E,<br/> E#=Fb, F and so on.</p><p>We finally get to the key of Ebbb.  Please try<br/>writing out the key signature ... :-)</p><p>As I see it, there are two simple solutions for<br/>the kind of mess this leads to.  They are:</p><p>(A)  More distinct accidental symbols, as in<br/>Saggital.</p><p>(B)  More nominals. This corresponds to the<br/>approach b) above.  32-EDO, for example,<br/>might use these:<br/>(1)  D.V.U.E.F.T.S.G.R.A.Z.Y.B.C.X.W.D<br/>or these:<br/>(2)  D.V.W.E.F.X.Y.G.Z.A.R.S.B.C.T.U.D<br/>or these:<br/>(3)  D.L.M.E.F.N.O.G.P.A.H.I.B.C.J.K.D<br/>or even these:<br/>(4)  A.B.C.D.E.F.G.H.I.J.K.L.M.N.O.P.A<br/>in place of these:<br/>  D.....E.F.....G...A.....B.C.....D</p><p>The first three alternates preserve the current<br/>meanings, more or less, of the nominals A to G.<br/>I personally think the fourth way, although more<br/>radical, would actually work best in practice.</p><p>Still, for relatively low-numbered EDOs, solution<br/>(A) may be best; it requires only that we have,<br/>and learn the use of, one accidental symbol for<br/>each of the inter-nominal degrees, such as the<br/>dots in D.....E represent.  We already have #, x<br/>and b, so really need just two more accidentals<br/>to fill the gaps for 32-EDO.  For mine, these<br/>could easily be such readily available and easily<br/>written symbols as @ and *, which also happen<br/>to be large enough to avoid confusing with fly-<br/>specks!</p><p>So I think your 32-EDO notation:<br/>  D.....E.F.....G...A.....B.C.....D<br/>could be filled in as follows, using the sequence<br/>of accidentals #x@*b ascending:<br/>  D, D#, Dx, D@, E*, Eb, E, E#=Fb, F, etc.</p><p>If you need even more inter-nominal notes for<br/>a particular n-EDO, then we need only add a<br/>further accidental symbol or two.  These<br/>should come, in the first instance, from the<br/>symbols available on every keyboard, and also<br/>should not have any other musical meaning at<br/>present, for example we might extend the list<br/>of accidentals to read #x@*=&amp;$%b, dropping<br/>those from the middle of this set of nine that<br/>we don&apos;t need (*), none of which should cause<br/>any confusion.</p><p>(*) So we would use,<br/>for 3 accidentals: #xb<br/>for 4 accidentals: #x%b<br/>for 5 accidentals: #x@%b<br/>for 6 accidentals: #x@$%b<br/>for 7 accidentals: #x@*$%b<br/>for 8 accidentals: #x@*&amp;$%b<br/>for 9 accidentals: #x@*=&amp;$%b</p><p>The great advantages of this approach are:</p><p>1.  it builds on current practice, so needs minimal<br/>relearning for everyone, both writer and reader;</p><p>2. it is easily extensible;</p><p>3. it is quick to write and to read;</p><p>4. it is _immediately_ usable in all notation<br/>programs that accept text entry.</p><p>What do you reckon?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.371 / Virus Database: 267.14.3/209 - Release Date: 21/12/05</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2005 6:56:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yahya Abdal-Aziz wrote:</p><p>&gt; One thing is a little unclear, though:  By &gt; &quot;a sensible notation&quot;, do you mean one with<br/>&gt; no more than the seven nominals A to G?</p><p>I left that a little vague since I want to leave the possibilities open, but basically I&apos;m looking for notations that have something in common with the familiar system of notation in the way that intervals are notated (e.g., a sensible notation for an ET that has good fifths is one in which the fifths are notated in a chain of fifths BEADGCF, but if the minor thirds are better, a chain of minor thirds should be notated E# G# B D F Ab Cb).

Since the major thirds are better than the fourths in<br/>16-ET, a third-based notation might be preferable. With a fourth-based<br/>notaiton, the interval notated as a &quot;sharp&quot; would end up going one step<br/>down, which conflicts with the traditional usage of sharps.</p><p>There are also cases where the notation based on major thirds conflicts<br/>with the notation based on minor thirds (although I&apos;m away from home for a<br/>while and didn&apos;t bring my tuning notes with me). As a general rule, it<br/>seems that the better notations are the ones based on the intervals that<br/>deviate the least from the just intervals, but I expect that some of the<br/>ET&apos;s could have conflicting notations that each have some desirable<br/>properties without any one of them standing out as obviously better.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/2005 5:48:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Fri, 23 Dec 2005 14:01:23 +1100, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Do you know whether there are any cases (for<br/>&gt; &gt;moderately small n) where interpreting n-EDO<br/>&gt; &gt;as chains of fifths or chains of thirds would<br/>&gt; &gt;select different steps from the gamut for the<br/>&gt; &gt;same note spelling?

These are out of date. _All_<br/>unaccented single-shaft sagittal symbols now have single-character<br/>ASCII or 8-bit ASCII (ISO Latin-1) equivalents.
