This is from a biography of Buxtenude on the net.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Buxtehude est choisi le 11 avril 1668.  Au meme moment, il faut omme<br/>&gt; Werkmeister, un poste comprenant les taches de secretaire, de tresorier et<br/>&gt; d&apos;agent administratif de l&apos;eglise; ce poste, comportant un salaire distinct,<br/>&gt; etait normalement devolu a l&apos;organiste.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wim, can you or someone else help give a specific translation?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, this helps explain the close connection between Bux and W.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Johnny, obviously this French text is a translation out of Buxtehude&apos;s<br/>biography in the New Grove dictionary of Music. The original reads as<br/>follows (Vol.3, page 526):</p><p>With he death of Franz Tunder on 5 November 1667 the position of organist of<br/>the Marienkirche at L&#xFFFD;beck, one of the most important in north Germany,<br/>became vacant. After several other organists had applied for the post and<br/>been rejected, Buxtehude was chosen on 11 April 1668. At he same time he was<br/>appointed Werkmeister, a post encompassing the duties of secretary,<br/>treasurer and business manager of he church; it carried a separate salary<br/>but as this period was given to the organist.</p><p>&quot;Werkmeister&quot; doesn&apos;t mean Andreas Werckmeister. It&apos;s the german word for<br/>chief or office-manager. That&apos;s why its spelled with a capital.</p><p>However, there is a link between Buxtehude and  Werckmeister The Grove<br/>biography of Buxtehude reads on page 527:</p><p>&quot;Poems by Buxtehude also appear in the Harmonologia musica (1702) of Andreas<br/>Werckmeister; it was Werckmeister who conveuyed many of Buxtehude&apos;s organ<br/>compositions to J.G.Walther, whose copies are still extant.&quot;</p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div><h3><a id=7834 href="#7834">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>1/16/2000 9:40:28 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ah, thanks, Wim, I finally got it.  Werkmeister is the position and<br/>Werckmeister is the person.  Still, the person Werckmeister must have met up<br/>with B. sometime during their earlier days.  It would explain the<br/>Werckmeister III small organ at St. Jacobi church in Lubeck more easily.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
