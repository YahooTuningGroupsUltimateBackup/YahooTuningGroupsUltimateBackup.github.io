I&apos;m not trying to do western triadic music,<br/>&gt;though of course that will be an influence in my music, since I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;steeped myself in it for 15 years or so now. :)</p><p>Everyone seems to have misunderstood this. I wasn&apos;t talking about _your_<br/>scale, William; I was talking about the regular duodene on the 3-5 plane. My<br/>point was simply that one should be aware of its limitations with regard to<br/>Western triadic music, so that one can be aware of the potential limitations<br/>of an analogous construct (i.e., your scale) with regard to any new style<br/>using harmonies based on 3 and 7.</p><p>With regard to your V-IV-I progression, it seems like you&apos;re proposing a<br/>&quot;diatonic&quot; scale of</p><p>1/1 9/8 7/6 4/3 3/2 14/9 7/4 (2/1)</p><p>In this scale you&apos;ll find a &quot;wolf&quot; interval of 21:16 between 4/3 and 7/4.<br/>One way to eliminate this is to temper out the scale; i.e., in 22-equal:</p><p>0 4 5 9 13 14 18 (22)</p><p>I call this scale &quot;sub-minor&quot; in my paper on 22-tone equal temperament. If<br/>you&apos;re looking for a 12-tone superset, an excellent one is</p><p>0 2 4 5 7 9 11 13 14 16 18 20 (22),</p><p>which falls naturally on a standard keyboard starting on A, and contains not<br/>only awesome 3-7 resources but full 3-5-7 ones as well.</p></div>
