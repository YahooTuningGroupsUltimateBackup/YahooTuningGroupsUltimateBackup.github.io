Just when I though that the FAQ might be useful to<br/>&gt;me it seems that it is to be in hypertext, which makes it<br/>&gt;hard to take home and read.  OK so I am in a minority, but<br/>&gt;I am not usually attached to the network when I read<br/>&gt;e-mail, and very rarely do I use the web for anything,<br/>&gt;being visual, gaudy, required clicking and all kinds of<br/>&gt;other things from which I prefer to protect myself.</p><p>Dave:</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m with you John,</p><p>&gt; Hey guys, how about making the FAQ plain ASCII with explicit<br/>&gt; URLs? They get turned into links by most email readers anyway.</p><p>I am in **100% agreement** with John and Dave and am not<br/>certain they are an actual minority. I myself prefer to<br/>read my FAQs in the bathtub and would like to do so<br/>without electricuting myself. I also require the ability<br/>to mark the bejammers out of everything with my colored<br/>pens, underlining things, drawing arrows and stars, and<br/>writing &apos;crackpot!&apos; and &apos;huh?&apos; all over the margins!! :-)<br/>(As well as scribbling out the math for myself to see if<br/>it has any validity.)</p><p>Seriously, I love the FAQs that are out there that come in<br/>6 parts each 1 MB long and just ramble on about the topic<br/>from various perspectives at length, interspersing actual<br/>FAQs with actual Best-Ofs with actual FQAs. Some sections<br/>might have multiple definitions like a dictionary does;<br/>other sections might read like a US Supreme Court decision<br/>-- with majority and minority opinions containing<br/>concurrences and dissenting viewpoints. Also, they are<br/>usually structured something like:</p><p>1.1.0<br/>1.1.1<br/>1.1.2<br/><a href="http://1.1.2.1">1.1.2.1</a><br/><a href="http://1.1.2.2">1.1.2.2</a><br/>1.2<br/>1.2.1<br/>2.1</p><p>etc. -- so that you can say: &quot;for mare about this, see<br/>section <a href="http://9.5.2.3">9.5.2.3</a> -- &apos;Throat Warbling Temperaments&apos;&quot;</p><p>On the otherside, I have no use for HTML FAQS at all and<br/>avoid them like the devil dogs of satan they are :-)<br/>unless they at least have a &apos;click here to download this<br/>entire site as a .zip file&apos; link like the Monz&apos;s.</p><p>The problem with hypertext is that it is nonlinear and<br/>cannot therefore be read -- it can only be browsed, and<br/>usually in a trance-like state of confusion. Hypertext<br/>links might be ok to get to section <a href="http://9.5.2.3">9.5.2.3</a> from 7.1.4 but<br/>that leaves you with the problem that either the files are<br/>too big and cannot be easily jumped to without waiting<br/>forever, or are too small and cannot easily be read<br/>straight through.</p><p>This is a real problem for those of us who do not have<br/>always-on wireless T3 connections like you fat cats at the<br/>universities! :)</p><p>Even so I think a HTML version would be OK for those<br/>who want to maintain it -- but I would definately want to<br/>see a standard USENET type version as well. I think<br/>it would be easier to keep things in ASCII as<br/>the basic raw format. Then those who want to can make up<br/>hypertext sites using whatever format and organization<br/>they fancy.</p><p>It seems obvious to me that the job of the editor<br/>is difficult enough to produce a text version.<br/>If the editor has to impose some sort of multidimensional<br/>graph on the whole thing, then the task becomes onerous<br/>and unpleasant.</p><p>Also, I do not want to be learning new revision control<br/>systems using untested cutting-edge ASP technology just in<br/>order to be allowed to write faq entries. And I certainly<br/>am not going to be trying to mess around on Yahoos ultra<br/>slow site rooting around in some weird system for draft<br/>faq entries to read and offer comments on. How do I know<br/>it is weird? Cos the simple directions and explanations<br/>offered on how easy it is to use are totally weird! It&apos;s<br/>fine for technology addicts (no disrespect intended) but<br/>the FAQ should be open and accesible to everyone, not just<br/>the technology fans.</p><p>I hate having to be online! And I have 21 years of<br/>programming experience! So it&apos;s not because I am too dumb<br/>to figure it out! (I also refuse to learn to program most<br/>VCRs, to type in vi (&quot;at the center of evil you find vi&quot; -<br/>js) or to mess around with any more badly designed<br/>technology -- I&apos;m more productive ignoring it all and<br/>sticking with what works rather than thrashing around like<br/>an overloaded network server.)</p><p>Personally, my plan is that if there is no text version, I<br/>will cut and paste one together myself and put it on my<br/>own website when I get it up and running. And I think<br/>everyone who wants to should also do the same -- grab the<br/>faq and put it on their own sites with a note at the start<br/>saying &apos;the latest version of this document may be found<br/>at <a href="http://wherever.com/tuning-faq.txt">http://wherever.com/tuning-faq.txt</a>&apos;.</p><p>I think the interactive stuff and the diagrams and music<br/>examples are really great ideas and that links to them<br/>should be included in the FAQ, but with most of the<br/>discussion in those links being replicated in the FAQ<br/>(minus the examples). That way people can at least know<br/>what they&apos;re missing without having to waste time screwing<br/>around on the internet endlessly clicking and not being<br/>able to absorb any ideas because of the distractions of<br/>following links in a nonlinear haphazard arrangement,<br/>which describes almost everything on the web. In the old<br/>days people organized and structured material *a little<br/>bit* so that it could at least be read. With hypertext,<br/>people just randomly connect stuff and there is no<br/>cohesiveness to any of it. I do not fool myself into<br/>imagining that we need a cohesive voice in our FAQ (in<br/>fact I am opposed to it), but I think that we should at<br/>least be able to read the FAQ straight through and bring<br/>it together that way since I know it will not be brought<br/>together by any sort of unifying agreement on the theory,<br/>practice and meaning of musical art. And if it does then<br/>it will be of limited usefulness. (!)</p><p>(I should point out here that time and time again I hear<br/>crackpot tuning theories and then I hear the music<br/>realized in the crackpot tuning theory and am surprised to<br/>find that it is great stuff and so maybe the crackpot knew<br/>more than I did! The point of this digression is that<br/>totally incompatible and contradictory theoretical systems<br/>can produce great art.)</p><p>As far as automatically mailing the faq to new subscribers<br/>goes, you want to be careful. The faq could reasonably be<br/>several megabytes in length, which even if broken up might<br/>overflow the mailbox size limit (and even automatically<br/>incur additional charges) as well as severely irritate the<br/>hapless recipient.

My main point<br/>&gt;(and only point, really) is that the content of the FAQ is going to<br/>&gt;have to get written up *no matter what*, and that is all going to<br/>&gt;come in a very plain, text format. Once there, it can be poured into<br/>&gt;whatever type containers you like: .html, .pdf, anything.</p><p>I would, however, like to avoid the complication of supporting two or<br/>more formats, unless others would agree to volunteer as well.</p><p>[Jon:]<br/>&gt;A very plain format has benefits outweighing it&apos;s first-impression,<br/>&gt;well, &quot;plain-ness&quot;: a good place to start; the content to place in<br/>&gt;more elegant containers; a basic format very easy to deliver (on a<br/>&gt;web page, in a .zip or .sit. or [name your archive] file, for<br/>&gt;a &apos;printer-friendly&apos; page).</p><p>See below.</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I must confess that I do not understand the fear and/or loathing<br/>&gt;&gt;that hyper-links seem to inspire in some people.</p><p>&gt;Unless I am mistaken, didn&apos;t you fess up to very little web design<br/>&gt;experience?</p><p>Quite so.  And, as part of my very minimal knowledge, I know that it<br/>is possible, using the &lt;pre&gt; tag, to produce nice basic text (with a<br/>fixed-pitch font, for those lattice diagrams) which, however, can<br/>contain links (by name) directly to any other place.  In this format,<br/>ordered insertions are easy, since sequential numbers are unnecessary.</p><p>[Jon:]<br/>&gt;Having maintained and designed websites for over 5 years,<br/>&gt;I neither fear nor loathe them, but *respect* the extra work<br/>&gt;involved. Links can be added (and constantly watched for changes);<br/>&gt;graphics can be developed, etc. etc. Just seems to make sense to<br/>&gt;start from first principles and then go from there.</p><p>But, you don&apos;t seem to appreciate my concern that maintaining an Ascii<br/>FAQ (with inevitable insertions) will be _more_ work than maintaining<br/>a very simple html FAQ.

Then we can all<br/>debate the FAQ and revise it as usual. Once the<br/>FAQ entry is settled down, the author can<br/>post it as &quot;FAQ FINAL: What is Meantone?&quot; or<br/>such - including FAQ FINAL. Then JdL, as editor<br/>can collect those and put them where he thinks<br/>best in Walker&apos;s tree system and, as editor,<br/>add links or special $$ tags or whatever,<br/>or nothing at all -- whatever editing for form<br/>he likes. Since JdL puts the file in the<br/>tree, the Luddite FAQ entry author is protected<br/>from the system which for many of us can function<br/>as a black box which Robert and JdL are the<br/>keepers of. The black box will eventually produce<br/>an HTML website AND an ASCII USENET file with<br/>numbered section headers so bathtub dwellers<br/>can still navigate the document. FAQ authors who<br/>want to get more involved can put the files in<br/>the yahoo tree themselves and perhaps learn<br/>Robert&apos;s system for organizing GIF&apos;s and MPEGs<br/>in folders and so forth. They can then post<br/>a note saying that a new revision up with<br/>the yahoo address.

Am I missing something??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are perfectly right. Forgot that I&apos;d renamed it to &quot;faq&quot;. Sorry.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; OK... Now when I made my text entry in the Files area I was<br/>allowed to create text right on the screen in the Website...  I did<br/>not have a .txt file, per se.  Is this ALSO a possible way to do it??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, that&apos;s fine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I notice, though, that using that method, I get a kind of &quot;weird&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; filename.  In this case my path is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/faq/19-tET%20notation">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/faq/19-tET%20notation</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A bit strange, but will it work??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; NO, it won&apos;t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since a space character isn&apos;t url-safe, one uses %20 if one wants<br/>&gt; to use one in a url (and % followed by other numbers for other non<br/>&gt; url safe characters).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For instance, Windows is happy with spaces in file names,<br/>&gt; but I think Linux / Unix doesn&apos;t allow it yet, and Windows 3.1<br/>&gt; certainly didn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Often it&apos;s fine to do this, but unfortunately, the tree control<br/>doesn&apos;t understand this notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So what it means is that you had a space in the file name - would<br/>&gt; have given it as<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;19-tet notation&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; naturally enough.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What you have to do is to rename you file so that it has no spaces<br/>&gt; in the name.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A very common convention here is to use an underline instead of a<br/>space:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;19-tet_notation&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>HI ROBERT!</p><p>Of course... I was wondering what the %20 was all about!  I have<br/>renamed the file and, yes, I did know about that &quot;convention...&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Did I do it correctly, or must I upload a &quot;true&quot; .txt file??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In any case, SOMETHING is showing in the Database.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes that&apos;s correct, you just need to give the path as you did<br/>&gt; (of course you need to edit it to the new version of the filename<br/>&gt; with the underline)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It has also brought up a couple of bugs in the system already - but<br/>&gt; this is how we will be able to fix them, hopefully!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You gave &quot;Test file&quot; as the short description ,which is what one<br/>&gt; will see in the tree itself, the text you click on to show it,<br/>&gt; and &quot;19-tET notation&quot; as the longer description, which will show<br/>&gt; in the status bar, and be used when converting hyperlinks<br/>&gt; to ascii.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I noticed this, and it has now been corrected!</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s possible you won&apos;t have realised that&apos;s what wil happen??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So perhaps we should just have the short description, and use that<br/>&gt; everywhere, including when one converts hyperlinks to your file to<br/>&gt; ascii as well - i.e. delete the long description file.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is just a refinement; not essential if it is going to cause<br/>&gt; confusion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you think?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I used the same &quot;description&quot; for both... so I guess the answer would<br/>be &quot;yes...&quot;</p><p>&gt; The other bug is in the system I&apos;d worked out for saying where you<br/>want your entry to go.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first column is supposed to have two things in it, the folder<br/>you want your file to go into plus the date of creation of that<br/>folder.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Better just to have the folder name. But then, what do we do about<br/>&gt; duplicated names??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; E.g. there may be several folders on the tree called notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The simple solution here is just to say that one must give each new<br/>&gt; folder a unique name.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So one has<br/>&gt; notations<br/>&gt; notations (Gothic)<br/>&gt; notations (Erv Wilson)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The program could prepare an alphabetical list of all the folders<br/>whenever the tree is refreshed (linked to as one of the first entries<br/>in the tree).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So when one wants to add a new folder, one first checks to see if<br/>the name you want to use is in the list already. If it is, you have<br/>to<br/>use a slightly different name (at last resort, use notations (a),<br/>notations (b), etc. if one<br/>&gt; can&apos;t think of anything else).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since the folder &quot;notations&quot; hasn&apos;t been created yet, you also need<br/>to tell the program where to put it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I imagine that is a suitable one to go at the top level.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So as a final step, to make it, add a new field<br/>&gt; folder ; descr (of the sub folder in this case)<br/>&gt; =<br/>&gt; main ; notations<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you wanted to put it in another folder, you&apos;d do it as<br/>&gt; calculations ; notations</p><p>Actually, Robert, for now I have created a folder &quot;notations&quot; and put<br/>my &quot;notation&quot; FAQ in it... but I agree we probably will end up with<br/>MORE &quot;notations&quot; folders before we&apos;re through!</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Will it work??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Actually, this seems like a great system, since people can just<br/>add  whatever they want in the files section and then we can decide<br/>what to reference or NOT to reference in the database.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It looks like a great system for this project...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Apparently, then, you can just take this database tree and turn<br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt; into EITHER a tree-based website or ascii...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Is that correct??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, that&apos;s true.<br/>&gt;</p><p>WELL THEN, LET&apos;S GET TOO IT!  (Sorry Jon Szanto for the caps!)</p><p>THIS IS GREAT!</p><p>&gt; Either a tree based web site, or place all the messages one after<br/>another in the same order as they are in the tree.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also when you edit your original file, the changes will immediately<br/>show up in the &quot;Work in progress&quot; tree, even if John hasn&apos;t refreshed<br/>it recently, since the url still points to your original draft.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;On-site&quot; tree will show your change next time he refreshes it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Except that I have to write the program to read the database and<br/>make the trees - haven&apos;t done so yet because of the debate, but it<br/>wouldn&apos;t take long to get at least the basics up and running - i.e.<br/>to<br/>make the &quot;work in progress&quot; tree up and running for any type of file,<br/>&gt; and to get the &quot;on-site&quot; tree working for ascii.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then a bit more work to get the on-site tree working for graphics<br/>&gt; sound and VRML etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Final stage would be to make it easy to re-organise the tree and<br/>&gt; to help with the final FAQ preparation - that can wait for a bit<br/>later.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll wait for your reply to see what you think, then perhaps redo<br/>the table with no date, and leave out the long description, to see how<br/>&gt; that works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can then have a go at adding the notations folder and see<br/>&gt; how that works perhaps, and anyone else who wants to try adding<br/>&gt; test folders and entries.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, I did this... as you will see...</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll probably also add a final field,<br/>&gt; &quot;Text or simple html suitable for conversion to Ascii (Y/N)&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes for a text file, and for simple html files.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No for a html file that depends heavily on hyperlinks, or graphics,<br/>&gt; VRML etc,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So you will need to say something for that, obviously, &quot;yes&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>GOOD IDEA.</p><p>&gt; I can then do the program, which won&apos;t take long, and take it from<br/>&gt; there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Only way really to see if it will work is to try it out!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for &quot;taking the plunge&quot;!<br/>&gt;</p><p>You&apos;re welcome, Robert.  This system makes a lot of sense, and I<br/>really hope the other members of the list agree to it.</p><p>In essence, it is really SIMPLE, and, perhaps some people have been<br/>&quot;put off&quot; by all the details...</p><p>The best part is the fact that all people have to do is put files in<br/>the files database!  That&apos;s about it... and organize folders.</p><p>THEN, the FAQ editor could be the person to decide how to organize<br/>the<br/>DATABASE.</p><p>Don&apos;t you think that might be the best &quot;role&quot; for the FAQ editor??</p><p>Then, actually, John deLaubenfels, if I am understanding this<br/>correctly, won&apos;t have to have anything AT ALL sent to him!</p><p>The editor can just decide which completed FAQ entries in the FILES<br/>section are ready to be incorporated into the tree.  And he will add<br/>them.</p><p>There will be debate on the Tuning List of the various entries which<br/>we can view in the &quot;files&quot; area until they are complete... or copy<br/>some of the text to the list for commentary and revision.</p><p>Then YOU, Robert, will do your &quot;magic&quot; and turn the whole thing into<br/>a<br/>beautiful HTML web tree OR, for the &quot;asciiphiles&quot; a nice, simple text<br/>that one can read while sitting on the... well, divan..</p><p>WONDERFUL!</p><p>________ _____ ______ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=19693 href="#19693">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/2/2001 7:37:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;J Scott&quot; &lt;xjscott@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19651.html#19690">/tuning/topicId_19651.html#19690</a></p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand Robert&apos;s system a little better now.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s actually quite easy, Jeff.

A fancy HTML thing.<br/>&gt; 2. A straight out ASCII USENET style FAQ.<br/>&gt;</p><p>YA GOTS IT</p><p>&gt; Also Robert acknowledges that some of the files<br/>&gt; may contain graphics and such any their authors<br/>&gt; may want it that way so those files can just be<br/>&gt; referenced in the ASCII version by their section<br/>&gt; title and a URL, and perhaps a short description.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I want to commend Robert for being willing to do<br/>&gt; all this work that will make _maintaining_ and<br/>&gt; _generating_ the FAQ so much easier for JdL.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a suggestion that I think possibly might<br/>&gt; work for everyone:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want to, you can post your FAQ revisions<br/>&gt; to the list as you always have. Then we can all<br/>&gt; debate the FAQ and revise it as usual. Once the<br/>&gt; FAQ entry is settled down, the author can<br/>&gt; post it as &quot;FAQ FINAL: What is Meantone?&quot; or<br/>&gt; such - including FAQ FINAL. Then JdL, as editor<br/>&gt; can collect those and put them where he thinks<br/>&gt; best in Walker&apos;s tree system and, as editor,<br/>&gt; add links or special $$ tags or whatever,<br/>&gt; or nothing at all -- whatever editing for form<br/>&gt; he likes. Since JdL puts the file in the<br/>&gt; tree, the Luddite FAQ entry author is protected<br/>&gt; from the system which for many of us can function<br/>&gt; as a black box which Robert and JdL are the<br/>&gt; keepers of.</p><p>Actually, this is a good idea.  HOW ABOUT IT ROBERT... maybe ONLY<br/>John<br/>deLaubenfels should have access to the &quot;database&quot; tree.</p><p>But, maybe YAHOO doesn&apos;t work like that...  In fact, it rather looks<br/>like it doesn&apos;t... EVERYBODY has access to the database that&apos;s on the<br/>group.</p><p>The black box will eventually produce<br/>&gt; an HTML website AND an ASCII USENET file with<br/>&gt; numbered section headers so bathtub dwellers<br/>&gt; can still navigate the document.</p><p>And great &quot;good clean fun&quot; at that!</p><p>FAQ authors who want to get more involved can put the files in<br/>&gt; the yahoo tree themselves and perhaps learn<br/>&gt; Robert&apos;s system for organizing GIF&apos;s and MPEGs<br/>&gt; in folders and so forth.</p><p>This is really not all that hard... It&apos;s just that we&apos;re seeing lots<br/>of &quot;details&quot; right now.  The basic system is almost &quot;moronically&quot;<br/>simple..</p><p>The best part is that there is no &quot;sending back and forth&quot; of files,<br/>and the sending to John of revision after revision.</p><p>John will like that.  Of course, John is out all next week, so we may<br/>get a slow start...</p><p>They can then post<br/>&gt; a note saying that a new revision up with<br/>&gt; the yahoo address. Debate of these pages can<br/>&gt; take place on the list or privately with the<br/>&gt; author - whatever the debater wants.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It sounds like an OK system as long as:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. FAQ authors don&apos;t have to use the system if<br/>&gt; they don&apos;t have web access, or don&apos;t want to use<br/>&gt; the system.<br/>&gt;</p><p>As long as the FAQ is posted to, and debated on the list, it can<br/>easily be COPIED as text to a file in the files area.  Anybody could<br/>do this for the &quot;web adverse...&quot;</p><p>&gt; 2. A text version with navigatable (numbered) cross<br/>&gt; references is one of the products of the black box.<br/>&gt; (all the numbers should just be automatically generated<br/>&gt; from the links JdL and the authors put in the docs).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, this aspect Robert is still working on, so we must &quot;bear with<br/>him...&quot;</p><p>&gt; So, like I said I do appreciate Robert&apos;s good work<br/>&gt; on this and patience in trying to explain it to us,<br/>&gt; as well as JdL&apos;s boldness to accept this position.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does this sound workable to any one else?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Jeff</p><p>THIS IS GREAT.

Bigger, multimedia content<br/>I could put at <a href="http://meantone.com">meantone.com</a> but no long-term promises on that one.</p><p>&gt; One very simple technique would just be to mark off the<br/>&gt; sections in the text - don&apos;t even need to edit the html tags:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just need some reserved sequence of symbols for it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anything unlikely to be used.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How about<br/>&gt; /*-------------<br/>&gt; (any number of dashes more than 10 and nothing else on the same<br/>&gt; line)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -----------*/<br/>&gt; for ascii section,<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; /-****************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *****************-/<br/>&gt; for the graphics section.</p><p>Or how about</p><p>&lt;ascii-section&gt;<br/>...<br/>&lt;/ascii-section&gt;</p><p>and</p><p>&lt;graphics-section&gt;<br/>...<br/>&lt;/graphics-section&gt;</p><p>An HTML parser, or maybe even an XSL stylesheet should be able to handle<br/>it.</p><p>&gt; Then to process it for the text faq, remove all graphics sections,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To process it for the graphics, remove the ascii sections.</p><p>The problem is that you then have three versions: the original, the text<br/>version and the HTML version.  That sounds like overkill, although it<br/>might be possible with an XML language.  I&apos;m not sure if XSLT on its own<br/>can render a good enough text version, but a few regular expressions<br/>should do the trick.</p><p>&gt; Could do same for bookmarks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In html there&apos;s something of a tradition of using words for<br/>&gt; bookmarks, as one can then re-arrange sections<br/>&gt; without having to re-number all the bookmarks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So if it was an html document, then at the end, maybe only once it<br/>&gt; has been volunteered, and selected for the ASCII FAQ, one would just<br/>&gt; go through it and add the section headings by hand as<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; /*1.1.7*/ &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;tuning_a_bouzouki&quot; /&gt;Tuning a bouzouki&lt;/h2&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; See &lt;a href=&quot;#tuning_a_bouzouki&quot;&gt;tuning a bouzouki&lt;/a&gt;.</p><p>It means the information is duplicated in different ways.  If the numbers<br/>were the same for HTML and ASCII, you could go through checking all the<br/>links in a web browser and know they must be right in text as well.</p><p>You could try using an XML format so that you could work out the numbers<br/>automatically.  Like</p><p>&lt;section name=&quot;practical instructions&quot;&gt;<br/>...<br/>&lt;section name=&quot;tuning_a_bouzouki&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;title&gt;Tuning a Bouzouki&lt;/title&gt;<br/>&lt;content&gt;<br/>...<br/>&lt;/content&gt;<br/>&lt;/section&gt;<br/>...<br/>&lt;/section&gt;<br/>...<br/>see &lt;link target=&quot;tuning_a_bouzouki&quot;&gt;tuning a bouzouki&lt;/link&gt;</p><p>And you could run through assigning section numbers and references to<br/>them.  It&apos;d need to be done as two passes, so I can&apos;t see XSLT working.<br/>I&apos;m sure I could write a parser in Python to do it, but it would take a<br/>while.  If I even had time to edit the FAQ, I&apos;d prefer to add entries to<br/>the end.  I can&apos;t see why you&apos;d ever need to insert an entry: the order<br/>shouldn&apos;t matter within a section.  If you do feel a need, you can use an<br/>&quot;a&quot;.  If you take out an entry, don&apos;t change the numbering so you don&apos;t<br/>break links.</p><p>&gt; I have something of a fondness for /* */ because of c, but of course<br/>&gt; one could use any convention.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe some other sequence would be better. What is unlikely to be<br/>&gt; used I wonder? How about %%<br/>&gt; %%1.1.7%%</p><p>How about &lt;!-- and --&gt; ?

Believe me, I&apos;m not looking<br/>&gt;&gt;to make my life more challenging over this; quite the opposite,<br/>&gt;&gt;along with my goal to provide the most useful FAQ possible.</p><p>[Jon Szanto:]<br/>&gt;I&apos;m sorry that I gave that impression -- believe me, I want whatever<br/>&gt;solution to be the least amount of work as possible, for the person<br/>&gt;in charge of it. I haven&apos;t had too much time to follow this, but in<br/>&gt;just reading a couple of Robert Walker&apos;s posts, I can&apos;t believe the<br/>&gt;complexity that is being built up -- all in the name of being simple!</p><p>&gt;(Not a slight on Robert&apos;s skills, but maybe it&apos;s a programmer&apos;s<br/>&gt;solution [speaking as a programmer myself!]).</p><p>Well, I&apos;m glad I&apos;m not the only one experiencing that sensation!  I<br/>feel like the grandfather in &quot;Moonstruck&quot;, when he says, &quot;I&apos;m CONFUSED!&quot;<br/>in that big scene at the end.  I _did_ succeed in struggling partway<br/>through Robert&apos;s scheme this morning, and, if we go that way, I would<br/>need to be the only person who understands it, since everyone else can<br/>simply e-mail their proposed FAQ&apos;s to the list for comment and eventual<br/>incorporation.</p><p>&gt;The only other thought I had was this: the whole thing had started<br/>&gt;with people like Daniel Wolf submitting a couple of drafts in an<br/>&gt;email message. Would it be possible to take each FAQ topic as a<br/>&gt;separate text file, and then have an index of all the questions? Each<br/>&gt;topic, as a page, could contain links and would always have a link<br/>&gt;back to the main index page. If there were additions/changes to the<br/>&gt;text files it would be easy to incorporate them, and there are a lot<br/>&gt;of tools available to take a very plain text file and convert it to a<br/>&gt;simple .html file. Then the entire directory could be zipped for<br/>&gt;download, and, once opened, you&apos;d only need to open the<br/>&gt;index.html/FAQ.html page in the browser and then browse to all the<br/>&gt;topics.</p><p>&gt;(If you&apos;d like, I could put up a dummy version of this idea on a temp<br/>&gt;page on my website, as an example...)</p><p>Thanks for offering!  If I end up taking a DIY approach, that&apos;d be<br/>very useful.  Let&apos;s wait and see how things shake out.</p><p>&gt;Of course, I would always end with: the format chosen should match<br/>&gt;what the editor of the FAQ would like to work with -- anything else<br/>&gt;is a burdon on the volunteer effort. So, John, if you would want to<br/>&gt;work with .html and there isn&apos;t some landslide in another direction,<br/>&gt;that&apos;s what you should do. I&apos;d be happy to point to .html resources<br/>&gt;to make the job easier if you like (for instance, quite a few<br/>&gt;freeware HTML-2-ASCII convertors...)</p><p>I&apos;d be glad to know of sources for such tools, but as far as the FAQ<br/>format goes, I don&apos;t want to make that decision.  So far, list members<br/>seem to be passionately Ascii.  Robert&apos;s scheme would seem to offer both<br/>formats, and, if I&apos;m understanding correctly, to accomplish renumbering<br/>when something new is inserted.  With such a tool, I can accept Ascii.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=19718 href="#19718">ðŸ”—</a>J Scott &#x3C;xjscott@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2001 9:45:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi John,</p><p>JdL said :<br/>&gt; ...

John<br/>knows how we feel about various options now, let him decide.</p><p>Here&apos;s my schisma worth: Maybe the root document (the FAQ proper) can<br/>use HTML, but in a very minimalist fashion, e.g. everything is between<br/>one pair of &lt;PRE&gt;...&lt;/PRE&gt; tags, and no non-ASCII graphics. But we<br/>would allow the use of links within the file, so paragraph numbering<br/>is unnecessary for internal references and one doesn&apos;t have to worry<br/>about renumbering after insertions.</p><p>Links to the outside world should still show the explicit URL. e.g.</p><p>See Monzo&apos;s Tuning Dictionary at<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/index.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/index.htm</a></p><p>Where you can click on the &quot;http:...&quot;.</p><p>Links within the file should show the section heading (usually the FA<br/>question). e.g.</p><p>See &quot;What is a logarithm?&quot;.</p><p>Where you can click on &quot;What is a logarithm?&quot;</p><p>This root document should be self contained in the sense that you get<br/>a short basic answer to every question within it, and it makes sense<br/>when read linearly (like a book). Links to outside are only for more<br/>detail.</p><p>Everything outside this root document can be HTML as fancy as you<br/>like.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p></div>
