Annis&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:wsannis@execpc.com">wsannis@execpc.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;From: Kraig Grady &lt;<a href="mailto:kraiggrady@anaphoria.com">kraiggrady@anaphoria.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;William!<br/>&gt; &gt;    Could you be so kind as to explain &quot;seyir&quot; to us. I think others<br/>&gt; &gt;mouths are watering also!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        I will venture an explanation based on my feeble understanding<br/>&gt;attained so far.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        First, a maqam (pl maqamat; turkish makam, pl makamlar) is<br/>&gt;basically a mode.  Now, as we all know from reading 16th century<br/>&gt;counterpoint textbooks, those church modes were not just *scales*, but<br/>&gt;patterns of use within those scales, with certain characterist melodic<br/>&gt;phrases and prefered cadences. (Yes, I know there are arguments<br/>&gt;against the phrases bit, but I don&apos;t care to deal with that now.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        A maqam, like a mode, has a prefered cadence sequence, and a<br/>&gt;range of notes, a scale.  Note that some maqamat do *not* repeat the<br/>&gt;scale at the octave.  Anyway, I&apos;ve never heard anything about defining<br/>&gt;phrases for maqamat, but one major way to distinguish two maqamat with<br/>&gt;the same pitch material is to pay attention to what tones are<br/>&gt;emphasized in a piece. [Given that the Persian dasgah system does use<br/>&gt;melodic phrases as part of the identity of a mode, I&apos;d be very<br/>&gt;surprised if there were no element of this in Arabic and Turkish<br/>&gt;music, too.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        During an improvisation (taqsim, pl taqaasim) -- most of this<br/>&gt;music is improvised -- the performer will over the course of the piece<br/>&gt;focus on certain regions of the scale of the maqam, with certain notes<br/>&gt;anchoring the whole thing.  So, simply using A minor for an example,<br/>&gt;we might have a maqam that emphasizes, over the course of a taqsim, A<br/>&gt;c e a e c A.  This is pretty western, since it&apos;s just the outline of<br/>&gt;the A-minor triad, then the octave, then back down.  The performer<br/>&gt;will hit each region surrounding those notes, coming back to those<br/>&gt;notes several times, then moving on to the next region.  A different<br/>&gt;maqam might emphasize A d e a e d A.  My current understanding is that<br/>&gt;5ths are a popular part of these region sequences.</p><p>********************************************************************</p><p>This brief description does not contradict what I have been able to<br/>squeeze out of master musicians of traditional Turkish music. I am<br/>pleased to see you are making the distinction between &apos;mode&apos; and<br/>&apos;makam&apos;. I do not believe they are the same thing, or even close.<br/>I have been trying desperately to capture and comprehend the basic<br/>elements that make up a makam for some time now, without much success.<br/>I have not yet seen in writing, in Turkish or in English, any such<br/>attempt either. The closest thing I have read is a 60 page monograph<br/>&apos;Mode&apos; by Harold Powers in the New Grove Dictionary of Music, 1980.<br/>Some of the ideas in this monograph resonate with my &apos;fuzzy&apos; perception<br/>of makam.</p><p>********************************************************************<br/>&gt;        Anyway, seyir (derived from Arabic sayr), means something like<br/>&gt;&quot;path,&quot; so, the path a melody follows.  Thus, just as in common<br/>&gt;practice music where for any piece in a major mode you were expected<br/>&gt;to dally about in the key of the dominant for a while, when playing a<br/>&gt;piece in maqam rast, you have to play about in certain note regions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        This all gets hopelessly muddled because over the course of a<br/>&gt;taqsim a good player is also going run (modulate?) through various<br/>&gt;maqamat, each with their own seyir, of course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        My biggest frustration is that no one has bothered to publish<br/>&gt;seyir collections on the web.  I&apos;ve heard of Turkish books of these,<br/>&gt;but I&apos;ve never seen one.<br/>********************************************************************</p><p>The reason, I believe, for the absence of such seyir collections<br/>anywhere is tha fact that it is not a finite set that can be listed<br/>within a finite amount of space. It appears there are infinitely many<br/>admissible seyirs in every makam structure, as well as a complementary<br/>infinite set of inadmissible paths.</p><p>********************************************************************</p><p>&gt;        So, I think the seyir represents a very interesting way to<br/>&gt;organize not only improvised music, but any music where you have long,<br/>&gt;non-metrical melodies. [Note: a taqsim is very free rhythmically.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        So, back to the Sethares question for me: 1) how are the tones<br/>&gt;of a seyir related to the cadence note of a maqam? and 2) are certain<br/>&gt;maqam -- and their particular seyir more popular on certain<br/>&gt;instruments?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--<br/>&gt;William S.
