I have for some time<br/>been interested in and taken special notice of the &quot;blues note&quot;<br/>corresponding to the F# in the following scale on C:</p><p>C Eb- F F# G Bb- C (where the minus sign indicates for the Eb the 7th<br/>harmonic over an F and for the Bb the 7th over a C)</p><p>I have a somewhat more than sneaking suspicion that this F# is<br/>actually the 11th harmonic of a C three octaves below the tonic. In<br/>Afro-American PRACTICE  (and not the &quot;whitewashed&quot; blues we often<br/>hear their pale would-be imitators play), and also in Black<br/>Gospel and other &quot;bluesy&quot; Afro-American musical traditions, I have<br/>observed that the blues note just above the F is much closer to the F<br/>than even the just 25:24 ratio chromatic semitone. The 11th harmonic<br/>would be in a skinnier 33:32 ratio to the F, and has a bluesy bite to<br/>it that sounds just right to my ear for what is actually going on in<br/>good, well-tuned blues.</p><p>The 13th harmonic seems to appear in some Arabic and Persian<br/>traditional scales and falls roughly in the middle of an Ab and an A<br/>from a C-based perspective. It also has a certain melodic flavor and<br/>characteristic bite that can become rather addictive once the ear<br/>learns to accept it.</p><p>The 17th harmonic feels like it wants to be the true minor 9th of an<br/>extended 7th chord using the 7th harmonic for the 7th. This would<br/>produce an 8:10:12:14:17 sequence. I suspect that JI in fact<br/>naturally seeks the simplest overall fit within a PATTERN of pitches,<br/>rather than seeking simplicity by staying at lower primes all the<br/>time. This would yield a diminished 7th chord by simply omitting the<br/>root of the m9-extended seventh, yielding ratios of 10:12:14:17.</p><p>An acquaintance of mine who used to manufacture JI guitars with<br/>interchangeable fretboards believes that the sudden popularity of the<br/>minor mode during the romantic era after 12t-EQ became virtually<br/>universal is owing to the minor 3rd of EQ being an extremely close<br/>approximation of the 19th harmonic. It yields a stable minor triad<br/>because the subtones it generates are in octave consonance with the<br/>tonic as, of course, the fifth does.</p><p>All this implies to me that perhaps we should consider that human<br/>beings with very musical, pitch-sensitive ears tend to construct<br/>musical patterns for practical performance that are based on subtle,<br/>intuitive perceptions of ideal relationships even when they fail to<br/>reflect those relationships with total accuracy as they manifest in<br/>practice.</p><p>If we accept this hypothesis, then we might consider that an<br/>idealized, comprehensive lexicon of human musical expression mandates<br/>an expansion of our thinking to 19-limit JI.

It is already the<br/>19th harmonic to such a close approximation that the difference is<br/>totally negligible (1 or 2 cents? I forget and don&apos;t have the means<br/>on hand to calculate it). Historically, at the same time composers<br/>began to employ the minor mode MUCH more fequently than before. The<br/>acquaintance I mentioned believes this is no mere coincidence.</p><p>I have also noticed many times that minor triads sound smooth on a<br/>standard synth keyboard in ET using timbres that make the Major 3rds<br/>sound totally gritty! Since the Perfect 5th is only 2 cents flat and<br/>the minor 3rds are virtually a perfect 19:16 ratio, the difference<br/>tones are in a consonant tonic and Perfect fifth relationship. The<br/>6:5 minor third on C, by contrast, generates a difference tone on Ab<br/>as it should, since it&apos;s the top a Major triad on Ab. This 16:20:24<br/>triad is not as stable to my ear as the ET virtually perfect 16:19:24<br/>triad for this very reason, I would conjecture.</p></div><h3><a id=26833 href="#26833">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/9/2001 1:18:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An acquaintance of mine who used to manufacture JI guitars with<br/>&gt; interchangeable fretboards</p><p>Name?</p><p>&gt; believes that the sudden popularity of the<br/>&gt; minor mode during the romantic era after 12t-EQ became virtually<br/>&gt; universal is owing to the minor 3rd of EQ being an extremely close<br/>&gt; approximation of the 19th harmonic.</p><p>I believe this too, though I&apos;d put the time much earlier, and perhaps<br/>attribute the disappearance of the Picardy third to this.</p><p>&gt; If we accept this hypothesis, then we might consider that an<br/>&gt; idealized, comprehensive lexicon of human musical expression<br/>mandates<br/>&gt; an expansion of our thinking to 19-limit JI.

I&apos;ll try to address your question below -<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob had said:<br/>&gt; An acquaintance of mine who used to manufacture JI guitars with<br/>&gt; interchangeable fretboards believes that the sudden popularity of<br/>&gt; the minor mode during the romantic era after 12t-EQ became<br/>virtually<br/>&gt; universal is owing to the minor 3rd of EQ being an extremely close<br/>&gt; approximation of the 19th harmonic. It yields a stable minor triad<br/>&gt; because the subtones it generates are in octave consonance with the<br/>&gt; tonic as, of course, is true for the fifth also.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph replied:<br/>&gt; Isn&apos;t that rather a high partial for deriving a simple minor<br/>third??<br/>&gt; Paul??<br/>&gt; Not doubting, really... just confused...____________ ____________<br/>&gt; _________<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob answers (as best he can):<br/>&gt; The point is that this 19:16 minor 3rd NATURALLY came up with the<br/>&gt; advent of virtually universal acceptance of 12t-ET. It is already<br/>the<br/>&gt; 19th harmonic to such a close approximation that the difference is<br/>&gt; totally negligible (1 or 2 cents? I forget and don&apos;t have the means<br/>&gt; on hand to calculate it). Historically, at the same time composers<br/>&gt; began to employ the minor mode MUCH more fequently than before. The<br/>&gt; acquaintance I mentioned believes this is no mere coincidence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have also noticed many times that minor triads sound smooth on a<br/>&gt; standard synth keyboard in ET using timbres that make the Major<br/>3rds<br/>&gt; sound totally gritty! Since the Perfect 5th is only 2 cents flat<br/>and<br/>&gt; the minor 3rds are virtually a perfect 19:16 ratio, the difference<br/>&gt; tones are in a consonant tonic and Perfect fifth relationship. The<br/>&gt; 6:5 minor third on C, by contrast, generates a difference tone on<br/>Ab<br/>&gt; as it should, since it&apos;s the top a Major triad on Ab. This 16:20:24<br/>&gt; triad is not as stable to my ear as the ET virtually perfect<br/>16:19:24<br/>&gt; triad for this very reason, I would conjecture.</p><p>Thanks so much, Bob, for your elaboration of this....  Yes, now I<br/>remember Paul Erlich discussing it some time ago...  This is really<br/>fascinating to see the relationship between the higher harmonics and<br/>12-tET!

The famous &quot;minor 7th/flat 3rd&quot; chord in jazz (e.g., C<br/>E G Bb- Eb-) ubiquitous in many jazz arrangements probably evolved<br/>from this, although it&apos;s usually executed in 12 EDO and in more<br/>&quot;citified&quot; bluesy contexts.</p><p>I know that some musicians, myself included at one ancient point,<br/>believed this was an attempt to harmonically reproduce an alleged<br/>melodic 3rd between major and minor in the blues.

It has that extra<br/>modicum<br/>&gt; &gt; of smoothness, allows dyads to be held constant from preceding<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; succeeding major triads, is consistent with a melodic practice<br/>when<br/>&gt; &gt; near-meantone intervals are the norm, and the root of the chord<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t really carry much structural relevance in the style (the<br/>&gt; &gt; minor triads are probably in first inversion (1/5:1/4:1/3) more<br/>&gt; often than root position anyway).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul... is this the tuning of the minor triad in meantone??</p><p>Very close . . . as you know, meantone deviates a little from 5-limit<br/>JI, but not too much (not more than 6 cents, typically).

LOVED your Robert Johnson page! Thanks tons! I&apos;m a bit naive<br/>&gt; concerning some of your analytical notation. However, I can grock the<br/>&gt; gist of a lot of it and the midi file transcription you did was<br/>&gt; SUPER!</p><p>Thanks, Bob.  And as I wrote in the last post, I&apos;ll be going into<br/>more detail about it at the El Paso conference, November 1-4.</p><p>&gt; It confirmed for me beyond what I would have imagined that the<br/>&gt; delicious melodic/harmonic &quot;bite&quot; of authentic blues comes from the<br/>&gt; use of higher primes, especially 11. I don&apos;t believe that just being<br/>&gt; &quot;out of tune&quot; with more standard tunings would EVER generate the same<br/>&gt; sense of pure &quot;delectability&quot; and harmonic deliciousness that these<br/>&gt; pitches do.</p><p>My ears tell me that Johnson very deliberately sang these microtonal<br/>pitches... in _Drunken Hearted Man_ they occur over and over again<br/>in all the verses.</p><p>&gt; I also liked that your minor 3rd analysis tends to favor a 7:6 ratio<br/>&gt; as I postulated in my initial message at the beginning of this<br/>&gt; thread. I might add that another possible source of the idea of the<br/>&gt; &quot;high&quot; minor 3rd between major and minor might be the tendency in<br/>&gt; blues to sing a minor 3rd over major chord stuctures at times,<br/>&gt; especially when the melody anticipates a change from a chord on I to<br/>&gt; a chord on IV. The famous &quot;minor 7th/flat 3rd&quot; chord in jazz (e.g., C<br/>&gt; E G Bb- Eb-) ubiquitous in many jazz arrangements probably evolved<br/>&gt; from this, although it&apos;s usually executed in 12 EDO and in more<br/>&gt; &quot;citified&quot; bluesy contexts.</p><p>Paul Erlich and I had a big debate about the rational implications<br/>of precisely that type of chord, Paul saying that the &quot;minor 3rd&quot;<br/>on top was implying 7:6, and me saying that it implied 19:16.<br/>It resulted in my writing a piece (never really finished) based<br/>on Jimi Hendrix&apos;s _Foxey Lady_:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/hendrix/hendrix.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/hendrix/hendrix.htm</a></p><p>Drew Skyfyre has put the whole discussion up on his website<br/>if you&apos;re interested:<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/drew_skyfyre/xe/Hendrix.html">http://members.nbci.com/drew_skyfyre/xe/Hendrix.html</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know that some musicians, myself included at one ancient point,<br/>&gt; believed this was an attempt to harmonically reproduce an alleged<br/>&gt; melodic 3rd between major and minor in the blues. As you can see from<br/>&gt; the previous paragraph&apos;s example, I have since come to believe that a<br/>&gt; just tuning of this chord would use the low &quot;subminor&quot; third of a 7:6<br/>&gt; ratio. I do not, however, completely eliminate the possiblity that<br/>&gt; some singers might actually use a high minor 3rd or low Major 3rd as<br/>&gt; they shift back and fourth between harmonic structures on I and IV.</p><p>My conclusion in the debate with Paul was that he was right, that<br/>on a 12-EDO guitar with a skilled performer bending the lower pitches<br/>of the &quot;sharp 9&quot; chord, the top two pitches would make the &quot;minor 3rd&quot;<br/>imply a 7:6 more strongly than any other ratio.  However, my personal<br/>preference for tuning this chord remains a 19:16 on top.  You can hear<br/>both in the last part of the excerpt of my piece.  The 19:16 has a<br/>bluesy, funky sound that I simply love.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
