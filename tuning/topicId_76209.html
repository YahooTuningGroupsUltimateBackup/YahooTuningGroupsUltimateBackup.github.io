Und wenn wir diesen Problemen<br/>augenblicklich noch entrinnen, so verdanken wir das fast<br/>ausschlie&szlig;lich einem Kompromi&szlig; zwischen den nat&uuml;rlichen Intervallen<br/>und unserer Unf&auml;higkeit sie zu verwenden. Jenem Kompromi&szlig;, das sich<br/>temperiertes System nennt, das einen auf eine unbestimmte Frist<br/>geschlossenen Waffenstillstand darstellt. Diese Reduktion<br/>der nat&uuml;rlichen Verh&auml;ltnisse auf handliche wird aber die Entwicklung<br/>auf die Dauer nicht aufhalten k&ouml;nnen; und das Ohr wird sich mit den<br/>Problemen befassen m&uuml;ssen, weil es will.<br/>Dann wird unsere Skala ebenso aufgehen in eine h&ouml;here Ordnung, wie die<br/>Kirchentonarten in der Dur- und Molltonart aufgegangen sind. Ob dann<br/>Viertel-, Achtel-, Drittel- oder (wie Busoni meint) Sechstelt&ouml;ne<br/>kommen, oder ob man direkt zu einer 53 t&ouml;nigen Skala &uuml;bergehen wird<br/>... l&auml;&szlig;t sich nicht voraussagen. Vielleicht wird diese neue Teilung<br/>der Oktave sogar<br/>untemperiert sein und mit unserer Skala nur noch wenig gemeinsam haben.&quot;<br/>Arnold Schoenberg: Harmonielehre, 3.

And if for the time being we still manage to escape those<br/>problems, it is due to little else than a compromise<br/>between the natural intervals and our inability to use them Â– that<br/>compromise which we call the tempered system, which amounts to an<br/>indefinitely extended truce. This reduction of the<br/>natural relations to manageable ones cannot permanently impede the<br/>evolution of music; and the ear will have to attack the problems,<br/>because it is so disposed. Then our scale will be<br/>transformed into a higher order, as the church modes were transformed<br/>into major and minor modes. Whether there will then be quarter tones,<br/>eighth, third, or (as Busoni thinks) sixth tones, or whether we will<br/>move directly to a 53-tone scale Â… we cannot foretell. Perhaps this<br/>new division of the octave will even be untempered and will not have<br/>much left over in common with our scale.&quot;</p><p>Arnold Schoenberg: Theory of Harmony 3rd Edition, p. 25 (1922)<br/>English translation by Roy E.

This tuning table would<br/>be: C=0, C#=1137, D=126, Eb=157, E=347, F=284, F#=474, G=663, Ab=694,<br/>A=789, Bb=821, B=1010 and C&apos;=1200.

But it is a good example of &quot;how to<br/>make microtonal music more difficult&quot;, and a classic example of one<br/>of things that drag microtonal music down and make it sound hmmm...<br/>what&apos;s the word... bad.</p><p>Chord numbers like I, ii, etc., come from functional harmony. Now,<br/>you can probably train yourself to hear the lowest tone of any<br/>roughly triad-shaped harmony as the root. But even in &quot;common<br/>practice&quot; music, where at first glance this might seem to be<br/>identical to hearing the &quot;real&quot; root, this is known to be bogus.</p><p>Look at the history of the 6-4 voicing, the second inversion.</p><p>Take what&apos;s got to be the most blatantly rooted triad of all:</p><p>0-386-702 (cents)</p><p>let&apos;s call it C-E-G.</p><p>There are probably dozens of different explanations as to &quot;why&quot; C is<br/>percieved as the root, but I&apos;ve never come across anything suggesting<br/>that, given the concept of &quot;root&quot; at all, C is not the root of a<br/>first position C Major triad. In orchestration, you might cocievably<br/>have a situation where the E is played fortissimo by the brass and<br/>C and G are whispered sotto voce by a blockflute and a comb-and-<br/>tissue-paper, and in composition you might have G hammered out 96<br/>times in a row while C and E appear once, or things like that, but<br/>when we&apos;re listening to a C Major first-position triad, and we<br/>believe in roots at all, C is the root.</p><p>Now drop the fifth into the bass, so it&apos;s now G-C-E. There is now a<br/>sixth above the lowest note, and a fourth, hence &quot;6-4&quot;. (C-E-G is &quot;5-<br/>3&quot;). The intervals are now 0-498-386, but it&apos;s still obviously a C<br/>major, right?</p><p>Well, listen to it and sing with it some, and it should be clear why<br/>there are long traditions, customs, and &quot;rules&quot; about the second<br/>inversion in tonal music. Descriptions vary- something like &quot;less<br/>stable than first position&quot;, &quot;somewhat dissonant&quot; all the way to &quot;it<br/>sounds like a suspension that wants to resolve, with G as the root&quot;.<br/>Only in &quot;musical set theory&quot;, or in uneducated common-practice-stylee<br/>chit-chat, would anyone claim that C-E-G and G-C-E are the &quot;same&quot;.</p><p>In the vast body of Western tonal harmony you&apos;ll find the second<br/>inversion far more often in cadences (it&apos;s even called a &quot;cadential&quot;<br/>voicing) and areas of modulation than elsewhere.</p><p>Pre-Rameau, before the idea of &quot;roots&quot; was &quot;established&quot; and things<br/>were so oriented to voice-leading and ear-o-ry, I bet this bad boy<br/>almost always held the G, with the C and E moving in parallel to B<br/>and D. If Margot Schulter is around, she&apos;ll know the exact dates and<br/>stats on these things.</p><p>So anyway: right from the git-go, in the most simple and<br/>straightforward tonal situation of all, we already have &quot;but...&quot;&apos;s<br/>and footnotes about the I, for crying out loud. We didn&apos;t even have<br/>to look at vii&deg; or whatever.</p><p>Now we start using microtunes and different tunings. If a simple<br/>matter of voicing already has at least some tonal impact on the most<br/>&quot;rooted&quot; chord of them all, it&apos;s as plain as day that when we start<br/>using all kinds of intervals in different inversions we&apos;re going to<br/>have ambiguous roots, indeterminate roots, whatever. Sooner or later<br/>we will be using chords that aren&apos;t nearly as evenly spaced as a<br/>major 3d + minor 3d, and the &quot;root position&quot; of such chords, or even<br/>the very existence of a &quot;root position&quot;, is going to be a matter of<br/>debate.</p><p>And this is going to happen even in a roughly diatonic and triad<br/>environment, which is just one possibility, not the only possibility.</p><p>It should be obvious that you can&apos;t shoehorn &quot;microtonal&quot; music into<br/>I-IV-V, not if you assume that those numbers have any real meaning<br/>whatsover. At the very least there must be a lot of qualifying.</p><p>Good luck with your new Yahoo group.</p><p>-Cameron Bobro</p></div>
