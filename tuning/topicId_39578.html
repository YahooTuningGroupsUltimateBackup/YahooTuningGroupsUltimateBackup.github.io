Yeah! Yeah! You have met up with an enlightened director, just as Partch did with Arch Lauterer.

I wish you tremendous success with these, it&apos;s what kids really need, and we probably need it more, in a way...<br/>The theater is so much richer with live (acoustic!) music, and with live music in &apos;non-western&apos; tuning is that much richer again.<br/>Cheers,<br/>Pete<br/> Alison Monteith &lt;<a href="mailto:alison.monteith3@which.net">alison.monteith3@which.net</a>&gt; wrote:Hi Folks</p><p>I&apos;m in the middle of a week long intensive rehearsal with the Scottish<br/>Borders Youth Theatre.
