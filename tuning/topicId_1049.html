Thus 81:64 is somewhat closer to 5:4 than to 9:7.</p><p>As a medievalist who regularly plays 13th-14th century European pieces<br/>in Pythagorean tunings, I might say musically that 81:64 has its own<br/>character nicely described by some writers of the period: it is a<br/>_relative_ or &quot;imperfect&quot; concord. While it is certainly possible to<br/>substitute a major third of 400 cents (12-tet), or even 5:4, without<br/>radically disrupting the &quot;grammar&quot; of the harmony, I would say that<br/>81:64 is just right: concordant and at the same time active.</p><p>In contrast, a 9:7 (or a Pythagorean approximation built from 16<br/>fifths, precisely a Pythagorean comma or ~23.46 cents wider than an<br/>81:64, or around 431 cents) is considerably more &quot;discordant.&quot; In a<br/>medieval context, it&apos;s usable specifically as a cadential interval<br/>expanding to a fifth, the kind of idiom suggested by Marchettus of<br/>Padua. However, I&apos;d regard this as a &quot;special effect,&quot; in contrast to<br/>the concordant and usual 81:64.</p><p>Another way to put this is that Gothic polyphony assumes an active<br/>major third less concordant than a fifth and somewhat more concordant<br/>than a pure major second (9:8) or minor seventh (16:9), intervals also<br/>having some degree of &quot;compatibility.&quot; The 81:64 nicely fits this<br/>role.</p><p>In contrast, many modern listeners, at least, perceive that a major<br/>second or minor seventh is _more_ concordant than a 9:7. If<br/>appropriate Gothic perceptions are similar, then it becomes clear why<br/>using 9:7 as a usual major third would upset the medieval balance.<br/>Indeed, if presented with _only_ a choice between 5:4 and 9:7, I would<br/>go with 5:4, because like an 81:64 it seems less concordant than a 3:2<br/>and more concordant than a 9:8 or 16:9. This isn&apos;t to cheer about the<br/>loss of historical color in the harmony and the wide diatonic<br/>semitones that would result, only to say that it would seem preferable<br/>to a pervasive use of 9:7.</p><p>As an aside, I would say that if asked to perform Gothic music using<br/>some well-known tuning for the major third other than 81:64, I might<br/>indeed go with 400 cents, much closer to the ideal than either 5:4 or<br/>9:7. In fact, 12-tet may be a closer approximation of Pythagorean<br/>tuning than of 5-limit just intonation, for example. It&apos;s humorous<br/>that some critics of 12-tet attack it as a reversion to &quot;medievalism,&quot;<br/>and as a medievalist, I don&apos;t necessarily see that as a flaw<br/>&lt;grin&gt;. Seriously, I would say that the real flaw is not 12-tet (one<br/>temperament compromise of many), but a worldview which treats it as<br/>the _only_ interesting or valuable tuning.</p><p>Getting back to Pythagorean -- for medieval music, why go with 12-tet<br/>or another approximation if Pythagorean is available? -- I find that<br/>playing some two-part clausulae from around 1200 with lots of<br/>prominent thirds brings out the qualities of 81:64 (and 32:27). These<br/>intervals can be quite &quot;sweet,&quot; but at the same time active; they move<br/>the music forward, even while also serving as momentary diversions.</p><p>Of course, the fact that 13th-14th century music is quite<br/>comprehensible (at least to me) even in a Renaissance meantone where<br/>things seem intonationally &quot;backward&quot; -- slightly compromised fifths<br/>and pure major third -- suggests the importance of categorical<br/>perception of intervals, another theme of this thread.</p><p>In fact, one might say that the usual &quot;phoneme&quot; for a major third has<br/>varied historically in European compositional practice, along with the<br/>stylistic use of this interval, but within a certain range. The narrow<br/>end of this range might be about 1/3 syntonic comma narrower than 5:4<br/>(as in 1/3-comma meantone and 19-tet), the middle range somewhere<br/>between 1/6-comma meantone and 12-tet (or 1/11-comma), and the wide<br/>end around 81:64. It isn&apos;t surprising that we find the wide end the<br/>norm in the Gothic polyphony of Continental Europe, and the narrow to<br/>middle range in later music with stable major thirds.</p><p>Two intonational systems, the modified Pythagorean tuning in vogue<br/>around the early 15th century and the unequal well-temperaments of the<br/>late 17th to mid-19th centuries, feature a mixture of major thirds<br/>ranging from around 5:4 (or Pythagorean 8192:6561) to around 81:64.<br/>Such systems, acceptable not only near the Gothic-Renaissance<br/>transition but also in the Baroque with its definitely tertian<br/>harmonies, indicate that 5:4 and 81:64 have both been tolerable<br/>&quot;allophones&quot; of the major third.</p><p>In contrast, I&apos;m not aware of a regular intonational practice<br/>documented during these eras with 9:7 used as a common &quot;allophone&quot; for<br/>M3. Another way of putting this is that apart from the Marchettan<br/>context I mention above, 9:7 would be considered a &quot;Wolf&quot;; in<br/>contrast, even in tertian music of a Baroque or Classic variety, 81:64<br/>has been considered at least marginally within (or at the edge of) the<br/>range of &quot;playability.&quot;</p><p>Here I should discreetly add that &quot;marginal playability&quot; is not the<br/>same as a good choice for the pervasive realization of an interval.<br/>Thus to play typical Renaissance keyboard music in Pythagorean tuning,<br/>or even 12-tet, is to make the thirds too &quot;restless,&quot; a flaw perhaps<br/>accentuated by the delicate shading of concord/discord in the 16th<br/>century.</p><p>In short, the various choices for tuning the &quot;major third&quot; phoneme in<br/>a European context -- 81:64, 5:4, 400 cents, 9:7, etc. -- nicely<br/>exemplify such perennial themes as stylistic evolution, categorical<br/>perception, and subjective taste.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/26/1999 3:54:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Message text written by Margo Schulter</p><p>&gt;In contrast, many modern listeners, at least, perceive that a major<br/>second or minor seventh is _more_ concordant than a 9:7.
