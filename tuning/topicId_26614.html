There are<br/>only 3 missing notes in the low octave (the same thing happens with the<br/>2:3, 3:4 design). The missing notes are (octave equivalent): 1*3*9, 5*9*11,<br/>1*5*7. If this was thought to be a serious deficiency, it could be remedied<br/>by adding 3 more frets.

See <a href="http://anaphoria.com/secor.PDF">http://anaphoria.com/secor.PDF</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; I spent most of today searching for the optimal combination of<br/>&gt; &gt; (a) open string tuning and<br/>&gt; &gt; (b) scale rotation for the fretting.<br/>...<br/>&gt; As someone who only peripherally followed your blackjack guitar<br/>&gt; thread, could you sum up the critera you use for (a) and (b)?</p><p>Yes. I&apos;d love to know if anyone thinks they should be changed, and how.</p><p>They&apos;re still a bit fuzzy, but here goes:</p><p>All frets must be continuous across the full width of the neck. There<br/>should be no more frets than are required to play the scale on a single<br/>string. e.g. 20 per octave for the eikosany, 21 per octave for blackjack<br/>and 30 per tritave (approx 19 per octave) for the 30 note MOS from the<br/>Bohlen-Pierce-Stearns (BPS) temperament.</p><p>------------<br/>Open strings<br/>------------<br/>1. The interval between adjacent strings should be some kind of third or<br/>fourth, preferably from a neutral third to a perfect fourth (9:11 to 3:4,<br/>350 to 500 cents). But at a pinch, it can go down to a subminor third or up<br/>to a superfourth (6:7 to 8:11, 267 to 583 cents), however two such very<br/>small or very large jumps should not occur next to each other and the<br/>extreme open strings should not span less than 1750 cents or more than 2500<br/>cents.</p><p>2. The intervals between open strings do not all have to be 11-limit<br/>&quot;consonances&quot;, but more chords are likely to be playable if most of them<br/>are. It is preferable if the open strings roughly approximate 3:4:5:6:7:9,<br/>3:4:5:7:9:11 or 4:5:6:7:9:11. But usually other criteria intervene.</p><p>3. The high string must contain the complete scale because these notes are<br/>not available on any other string. I call this string and any string which<br/>is period-equivalent to it (e.g. octave equivalent or tritave equivalent as<br/>the case may be), a &quot;reference string&quot;.</p><p>4. Open non-reference strings must be notes of the scale.</p><p>-------<br/>General<br/>-------<br/>Any non-reference string will be missing some notes of the scale.</p><p>The aim is to find the open string tuning within the above constraints that<br/>minimises the number of such missing notes, and to find the scale rotation<br/>on the reference string(s) (which determines the fretting for all strings)<br/>that puts those missing notes as far from the nut as possible.</p><p>In the case of linear temperaments, I refer to the refernce strings as &quot;r&quot;<br/>and the non-reference strings as r+1, r-2 etc. where the number gives the<br/>string&apos;s offset from the reference string in numbers of generators.</p><p>When the target scale is a contiguous chain of generators then obviously<br/>the number of missing notes will be minimised by minimising the number of<br/>generators that strings are offset from the reference. But usually the hard<br/>part is making this work within the constraints given above, regarding the<br/>intervals between adjacent strings.</p><p>The BPS-30 guitar is beautifully simple in this regard. The generator is<br/>about 442 cents (an approx 7:9) and so the open strings are simply arranged<br/>in a chain of generators from r-5 to r.</p><p>In the case of the MIRACLE-tempered eikosany, things are more complicated.<br/>I found that a shift of +-6 generators (a 2:3 or 3:4) gave the minimum<br/>number of missing notes (8), and equal second with 9 missing notes were<br/>r+-2 and r+-8.</p><p>I then drew a state-transition diagram where the possible &quot;states&quot; were<br/>represented as scattered circles labelled inside with these 7 open string<br/>tunings r, r+6, r-6, r+2, r-2, r+8, r-8. Then whenever a transition could<br/>be made from one string to another by an interval in the range of 267 to<br/>583 cents, I drew an arrow between those two circles and labelled it with<br/>the interval size. I then listed all the sequences of six open strings that<br/>ended with a reference string. To do this, it is best to start with &quot;r&quot; and<br/>follow arrows backwards (or draw them all as pointing from higher string to<br/>lower string in the first place). Some rearranging of the diagram often<br/>helps too.</p><p>I then chose those that minimised the number of different non-reference<br/>string offsets. There were only two that had only two different non-ref<br/>offsets. One had r-6 and r+8, the other had r-8 and r+6.</p><p>--------------<br/>Scale rotation<br/>--------------<br/>For each open-string set under consideration I draw a (linear) fingerboard<br/>for them using an arbitrary scale rotation (I actually just used a<br/>spreadsheet column for each string where a row represented one step of<br/>72-EDO or about 17 cents). I label the fret positions with the number of<br/>generators that each note corresponds to (arbitrary zero). Then I colour<br/>the extrascalar fret positions yellow. Any fret with no colour on it<br/>anywhere, is a potential position for the nut, with the scale rotated<br/>accordingly. I also colour the missing-notes&apos; non-fret positions red.</p><p>If we can find a scale rotation (nut position) so that no string has any<br/>missing notes occurring between the nut and the position corresponding to<br/>the pitch of the next higher string exclusive (the critical range), then we<br/>consider it a success, because although some notes will be missing from<br/>some strings, no note is completely missing from the guitar<br/>(period-specific, from the open low string to the highest fret on the high<br/>string). For convenience of tuning, it is nice to also have frets that<br/>corresponds to the pitch of the next higher string, (as with the Blackjack<br/>guitar), but this is not considered essential.</p><p>So for each potential nut, we count the number of missing notes in its<br/>critical ranges. If there are several with no such missing notes, we look<br/>for those that have frets corresponding to the next highest open string and<br/>if there are several of them we look for those for which the first missing<br/>note on each string is the farthest outside of its critical range or<br/>farthest from the nut.</p><p>In some cases, such as the {1,3,5,7,9,11} eikosany, we still have a few<br/>notes that are completely missing, say between the open low string and the<br/>lowest open reference string. There are 3 such in the case of the eikosany.<br/>One can either wear that, or consider adding more frets to include them.<br/>This may bring in the need for other optimisations which we will not<br/>consider here, but which are satisfied by the proposed eikosany guitar.</p><p>There is a certain amount of interaction between open string tuning and<br/>scale rotation, and it may conceivably be necessary to choose an open<br/>string tuning that has more missing notes but allows them to be placed<br/>outside the critical range on the non-reference strings. This possibility<br/>has not been explored for the eikosany, but seems unlikely.</p><p>A secondary consideration is the flip-side of &quot;missing notes&quot;, namely<br/>&quot;unwanted notes&quot;, i.e. notes that are outside the scale. We&apos;ll call them<br/>extrascalar notes, since they can sometimes be useful. But in any case,<br/>given two rotations that have the same number of missing notes in the<br/>critical range, I would choose the one that has the fewest extrascalar<br/>notes in the critical range.</p><p>&gt; Are the tetrads of the eikosany playable?</p><p>I expect that most, if not all of them, are playable in some<br/>voicing/inversion, but I haven&apos;t specifically looked at this.</p><p>Maybe you would volunteer to check it if I supply a diagram showing the<br/>first octave of the fingerboard with all the notes marked in a*b*c*2^n form?</p><p>You can refer to Erv&apos;s Eikosany lattice on Kraig&apos;s site. If you find it,<br/>could you post the URL?</p><p>You may even get a few extra non-eikosany JI chords introduced by the<br/>tempering, but of course you don&apos;t have to use them.</p><p>&gt; What do we gain by tempering the eikosany in 72 here?</p><p>Good question. First note that the design does not depend on 72-EDO in any<br/>way. Any suitable MIRACLE generator (near 7/72 oct) can be used, e.g.<br/>optimising some favourite weighted error. I use 72-EDO as a convenient<br/>standard.</p><p>It is conceivable that actual tempering of the eikosany may not be<br/>necessary, and that the MIRACLE temperament merely made the search for a<br/>guitar solution tractable. But I rather strongly suspect that it must be<br/>tempered in order to acheive anywhere near this many notes of the eikosany<br/>with only 20 continuous frets per octave and no frets closer than 33 cents.<br/>This should become obvious if I supply the abovementioned fingerboard<br/>diagram.</p><p>Remember that the 11-limit errors in this temperament are no larger than<br/>the typical intonation errors of even the most carefully intoned guitar<br/>with independent bridge adjustments for each string. So for a guitar,<br/>MIRACLE _is_ JI.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2001 10:20:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here&apos;s a linear fingerboard diagram (first octave) for the eikosany guitar.</p><p>3*5*7     3*5*9     5*7*9/2   3*5*7*2   3*5*9*2   5*7*9     nut     0c</p><p>m(1*3*9)<br/>          m(1*5*7)<br/>1*5*11    x         3*5*11    1*5*11    x         3*5*11    1fr    83c</p><p>x         x         1*3*7     x         x         1*3*7     2fr   117c</p><p>3*7*11    3*9*11    7*9*11    3*7*11    3*9*11    7*9*11    3fr   167c</p><p>1*3*5     1*7*11    1*5*9     1*3*5     1*7*11    1*5*9     4fr   233c</p><p>          c<br/>m(5*9*11)</p><p>1*7*9     x         3*7*9     1*7*9     x         3*7*9     5fr   317c</p><p>x         3*5*11    5*7*11    x         3*5*11    5*7*11    6fr   350c</p><p>1*3*11    x         1*9*11    1*3*11    x         1*9*11    7fr   400c</p><p>c</p><p>1*5*7     1*5*9     3*5*7     1*5*7     1*5*9     3*5*7     8fr   500c</p><p>x         x         1*3*9     x         x         1*3*9     9fr   550c</p><p>x         3*7*9     1*5*11    x         3*7*9     1*5*11    10fr  583c</p><p>1*7*11    1*9*11    3*7*11    1*7*11    1*9*11    3*7*11    11fr  667c</p><p>x         x         1*3*5     x         x         1*3*5     12fr  733c</p><p>3*5*11    x         5*9*11    3*5*11    x         5*9*11    13fr  783c</p><p>1*3*7     1*3*9     1*7*9     1*3*7     1*3*9     1*7*9     14fr  817c</p><p>x         x         1*3*11    x         x         1*3*11    15fr  900c</p><p>1*5*9     3*7*11    3*5*9     1*5*9     3*7*11    3*5*9     16fr  933c</p><p>x         1*3*5     1*5*7     x         1*3*5     1*5*7     17fr 1000c</p><p>1*9*11    x         3*9*11    1*9*11    x         3*9*11    18fr 1100c</p><p>x         1*3*11    1*7*11    x         1*3*11    1*7*11    19fr 1167c</p><p>3*5*7     3*5*9     5*7*9/2   3*5*7*2   3*5*9*2   5*7*9     8ve  1200c</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2001 10:31:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oops.
