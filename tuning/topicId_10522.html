You can map<br/>them to the keyboard in many different ways, some of which could better<br/>reflect the inherent structures of the scales, but the musical content of<br/>the scales is unchanged. If you&apos;re approaching the subject from the<br/>perspective of someone who already has a set of familiar fingering patterns<br/>on the keyboard, a totally different (and yes, perfectly valid) set of<br/>considerations would be appropriate to the question -- including, for<br/>example, many arrangements that simply reshuffle 12-tET pitches. For<br/>example, since you enjoy the effect of a 6-tone scale, with &quot;tritones&quot;<br/>sounding like &quot;octaves&quot;, you could explore all kinds of 6-tone scales found<br/>within 12-tET and find endless fascination in doing so (no facetiousness<br/>intended). However, that is not really the subject of this list.</p><p>&gt;I DID read your paper,<br/>&gt;but I&apos;m not understanding how it is done... except that you say<br/>&gt;something about starting another set at the pitch &quot;E,&quot; or something of<br/>&gt;that nature.  I&apos;m mystified at this.</p><p>I&apos;m surprised that my paper is so unclear to you. Is it that poorly written?<br/>In any case, the idea is that 22-tone equal temperament is mapped to the<br/>keyboard one note at a time ascending, except that the key &quot;B&quot; is skipped<br/>over. The obvious result is that two keyboard octaves sounds like a regular<br/>&quot;octave&quot;, which helps navigation immensely. The not-so-obvious result is<br/>that a symmetrical decatonic scale (and all its modes, of course) is formed<br/>by playing just the black keys. So the black keys are the &quot;naturals&quot; in this<br/>tuning, and the white keys are the &quot;sharps&quot; and &quot;flats&quot;. All the key<br/>signatures on the last page of my paper refer to this system.</p><p>The other keyboard mapping I refer to in my paper is a 12-tone mapping,<br/>which puts 1/22 oct. between E and F and between B and C, and 2/22 oct. at<br/>all other half-steps. Several different decatonic scales are available with<br/>this mapping, plus the familiarity of the intervals should be a big help to<br/>keyboardists like you.</p><p>I believe Manuel has implemented both of these mappings in Scala.</p><p>&gt;And I WAS comparing the &quot;quasi jazz&quot; chords that I made when I just<br/>&gt;played familiar &quot;keyboard patterns&quot; with the new scales...  But is that,<br/>&gt;as I say again, so totally IRREVELANT... when it is the product of such<br/>&gt;ingrained musicianship??...</p><p>It&apos;s, at best, a happy accident. Again, the mappings you were using were<br/>totally foreign to considerations of any inherent logic in the scale.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Granted, it would take a lot of conscious effort on any<br/>of these guitars to unlearn one&apos;s playing habits and focus on the structures<br/>unique to the tuning, but that&apos;s the kind of approach I would take if I went<br/>to the trouble of having these guitars made at all.</p><p>I still have to go through most of this process with my 22-tET guitar, but<br/>fortunately, the decatonic scales are extremely comfortable to play on the<br/>22-tET guitar in the nearest thing to &quot;standard&quot; tuning -- in any position,<br/>they require exactly four notes per string, and I happen to have four<br/>fretting fingers on my fretting hand! I still need to work on patterns and<br/>such . . . I&apos;m still much more fluent with two- or three-note-per-string<br/>patterns . . .</p></div>
