They are simply dissonances.</p><p>We have the names &quot;harmonic 7th&quot; or &quot;augmented sixth&quot; to distinguish the<br/>4:5:6:7 from the dominant 7th, and the name &quot;supermajor 7th&quot; (correct me if<br/>I&apos;m wrong) for the 1/9:1/7:1/6:1/5. But what should we call the 5:6:7 and<br/>1/7:1/6:1/5 to distinguish them from the diminished? Note that all these<br/>chords _are_ distinct in 19-tET.</p><p>I also argue from the presence of a 5:9 in the dom 7th (and minor 7th<br/>chord) to the fact that the diatonic scale ought to be considered as<br/>approximating 9-limit-with-no-7&apos;s (and maybe no 4:9?) rather than merely<br/>5-limit. This would shift the various optimal diatonic meantones somewhat,<br/>with the direction depending on whether 4:9&apos;s are included. Towards 1/4<br/>comma if 4:9 and 5:9 are included, towards 1/3 comma if only 5:9 is included.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=3895 href="#3895">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/1999 6:46:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Dave Keenan, TD 244.9:]<br/>&gt; I believe this has been a holy war in the past, but what the heck,<br/>&gt; it&apos;s my turn. :-)</p><p>&gt; I have come to the conclusion, based on how good they sound in 19-tET<br/>&gt; or 1/3 comma meantone, that in general, the &quot;ideal&quot; or &quot;correct&quot;<br/>&gt; tuning of diminished triads and dominant 7ths is not 5:6:7 and<br/>&gt; 4:5:6:7, despite their use in the clever adaptive JI of barbershop,<br/>&gt; but 25:30:36 and 20:25:30:36.

Do you mean merely one closer to 9:16, or one<br/>even further towards 4:7.

I was not considering JI, where the dominant seventh cannot be both<br/>the subdominant and a 5:9 from the dominant. I agree with Mark Nowitzky<br/>too. In this case I would use 9:16 but I still tend to think of this as<br/>playing the role harmonically, of an approximate 5:9 rather than an<br/>approximate 4:7 (and the upper interval as an approximate 5:6 rather than<br/>6:7).</p><p>I was rather considering how one should rate a temperament as to how good<br/>its dominant 7ths are, or whether in fact it has any. I concluded that<br/>proximity to 4:5:6:7 is completely wrong as a measure of this, but agree<br/>that proximity to 9:16 is important melodically. However in temperaments<br/>where the syntonic comma is distributed (i.e. many of interest) 5:9 and<br/>9:16 are the same thing.</p><p>Of course in 22-tET 4:7 and 9:16 are the same thing (and 5:9 is practically<br/>nonexistent), but as far as the sound of the chord itself, is this a good<br/>dominant 7th chord or rather a really bad dominant 7th chord but a<br/>reasonable harmonic 7th chord?</p><p>I want to return to another question:<br/>We have names that recognise 4:5:6:7 as different from a dominant 7th. i.e.<br/>harmonic 7th or augmented 6th (which is what I&apos;d say jazz and blues often<br/>use the 12-tET 7th chord to approximate). But what names are there that<br/>distinguish 5:6:7 from 1/7:1/6:1/5 from 5:6:36/5 = 25/6:5:6?</p><p>How about respectively:<br/>minor aug 4th (no 5th)<br/>subminor aug 4th (no 5th)<br/>diminished</p><p>It&apos;s just that those first two are a bit of a mouthful and don&apos;t<br/>necessarily translate to tunings other than meantones.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div>
