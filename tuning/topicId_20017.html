This was my first ever<br/>exposure to the harmonic drone.  I allowed it to grow upon me.  It<br/>sounded strange, initially, primarily because there was no &quot;plucked&quot;<br/>sound I am so used to.  Then I could hear many colors and hues and<br/>shades and nuances in it. We had &quot;Sa&quot; in three octaves, we got Pa,<br/>and then Re, Ni, also Ga, not to miss komala Ni (Bb) -- what more can<br/>we ask for?  Patience more than paid off. During the day, I found<br/>myself listening to it repeatedly.  The novelty dissolved into<br/>quality.  The pulsating, precessing power.</p><p>A few other observations:<br/>(i)  Is its &quot;Sa&quot;, the note E?  To me it sounded like F# [with a few<br/>cents added].  I confirmed that with my keyboard.  I do not know how,<br/>if, you convert the .wav file into the mp3 format.  I have observed<br/>that the software I use -- Jukebox -- changes the pitch of the<br/>original recording, to my dismay.</p><p>(ii) There were beats, in very high octave -- shrill, I thought.  I<br/>had to bring down, all the way, the 1K and 3K equalizer pointers of<br/>the WINAMP, to -20dB each, and the shrill was almost gone.  This<br/>beats-and-shrill started right on 0 second.  It increased upto the<br/>12th second.  Even without the equalizer adjustment, it became almost<br/>inaudible between the 13th and the 23rd seconds.  Then it grew louder<br/>again from there to the 35th second.</p><p>(iii)  I found the Sa, F#+, to be a little &quot;coarse&quot;, too.</p><p>Moreover, this kind of harmonic drone can be a &quot;just&quot; substitute for<br/>the harmonium that we use by way of accompaniment.  The use of<br/>harmonium is most regrettable, since the harmonium, even when<br/>specially and carefully tuned for the raga scales, can be used only<br/>for a particular key in which it is tuned.  The singers change their<br/>key quite often, rendering the harmonium more than useless.  In<br/>addition, the scale may need to be changed from one raga to the<br/>next.  Now, the harmonic drone can be an excellent substitute for<br/>harmonium.  This is because we can have several different<br/>combinations ready, separately, for several keys, justly.  But it<br/>would involve extensive work, including the mapping of the keyboard.</p><p>Lastly,  I would like to listen to your other harmonic drones, too,<br/>if possible.</p><p>Soon I will make available the sound of simultaneously played two<br/>digital drones on my site <a href="http://www.SoundOfIndia.com">www.SoundOfIndia.com</a>, in the key of C (or<br/>as close to C as the converting software will permit me to go).</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>3/10/2001 7:32:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Jacky,  I heard the sound of E_Drone.

I found your remarks fascinating too, and<br/>please allow me to comment.</p><p>I&apos;m glad that you found it to be something that you could listen to<br/>repeatedly. That was my goal. Sometimes, I&apos;ll have these playing in<br/>my house for long periods of time, when I&apos;m not working on music,<br/>which allows me to have a harmonic drone to sing with. I enjoy having<br/>them playing when I practice frame drumming too.</p><p>&gt; A few other observations:<br/>&gt; (i)  Is its &quot;Sa&quot;, the note E?  To me it sounded like F# [with a few<br/>&gt; cents added].  I confirmed that with my keyboard.  I do not know<br/>how,<br/>&gt; if, you convert the .wav file into the mp3 format.  I have observed<br/>&gt; that the software I use -- Jukebox -- changes the pitch of the<br/>&gt; original recording, to my dismay.</p><p>Yes, my friend - I did find that I had mislabeled the file. When I<br/>use these I will commonly have several playing together, playing in<br/>select ratios, and this F# was to be played against another Sa.<br/>Forgive the mistake, and I&apos;ve uploaded this again to the files<br/>section, retuned to Ga (E).</p><p>&gt; (ii) There were beats, in very high octave -- shrill, I thought.  I<br/>&gt; had to bring down, all the way, the 1K and 3K equalizer pointers of<br/>&gt; the WINAMP, to -20dB each, and the shrill was almost gone.  This<br/>&gt; beats-and-shrill started right on 0 second.  It increased upto the<br/>&gt; 12th second.  Even without the equalizer adjustment, it became<br/>almost<br/>&gt; inaudible between the 13th and the 23rd seconds.  Then it grew<br/>louder<br/>&gt; again from there to the 35th second.</p><p>Yes, and I should point out a couple of things here about this:</p><p>1.    The overdubbing of harmonic sweeps and synth drones that I<br/>layer together, will produce a slightly inharmonic drone. I also add<br/>in digital reverberation effects, and speed manipulations, which in<br/>the end, will slightly deviate from a perfect harmonic series. It<br/>might be of interest if I were to do some FFT analysis of some of<br/>these to see how inharmonic they are.</p><p>2.    The shrill effect comes from the sweeping of the highest<br/>harmonics that I use. These are really the &quot;raw&quot; waveforms, and when<br/>I use them in a final piece of music, I will have them mixed with<br/>other timbres, and will eq them and reverberate them, so they will<br/>blend with the ensembles.  To hear them in mono, this way is to hear<br/>them in their most naked form, but when they are used in the music, I<br/>like to have that glimmering effect of the highest harmonics, able to<br/>subtly &quot;cut through&quot; the mix. It is indeed a good idea to use eq,<br/>panning and effects in a final mix of these, where one may be glad<br/>for leaving the original wave a little &quot;bright&quot;. Obviously, it would<br/>be difficult to add back as an afterthought.</p><p>&gt; (iii)  I found the Sa, F#+, to be a little &quot;coarse&quot;, too.</p><p>I would agree. As above, they are slightly inharmonic, which I feel<br/>gives them character. When I re-tuned this to E, I used a sine wave<br/>to check the results, and found your observation to be true.</p><p>&gt; Moreover, this kind of harmonic drone can be a &quot;just&quot; substitute<br/>for<br/>&gt; the harmonium that we use by way of accompaniment.  The use of<br/>&gt; harmonium is most regrettable, since the harmonium, even when<br/>&gt; specially and carefully tuned for the raga scales, can be used only<br/>&gt; for a particular key in which it is tuned.  The singers change<br/>their<br/>&gt; key quite often, rendering the harmonium more than useless.  In<br/>&gt; addition, the scale may need to be changed from one raga to the<br/>&gt; next.  Now, the harmonic drone can be an excellent substitute for<br/>&gt; harmonium.  This is because we can have several different<br/>&gt; combinations ready, separately, for several keys, justly.  But it<br/>&gt; would involve extensive work, including the mapping of the keyboard.</p><p>This has been my approach as well. What I do, is build folders in my<br/>PC, where I have many different drones in a variety of keys, as well<br/>as having them arranged so that I can superimpose them against one<br/>another in just ratios. I always like to have them overlapping and<br/>panning, so there is no break in the drone - usually employing at<br/>least 2 distinctly different ones at the same time. Ideally, it would<br/>be nice to have this all set up in a sampler, but for now, the PC<br/>seems to be the solution for me - my sampler only has 32 megs of RAM.</p><p>They can be wonderful for practicing singing with, and I&apos;ve found<br/>them valuable too for developing my throat singing techniques.</p><p>&gt; Lastly,  I would like to listen to your other harmonic drones, too,<br/>&gt; if possible.</p><p>I&apos;ve uploaded several more examples for you and others to hear, as<br/>well as the E_Drone retuned:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Ligon%20FFT/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/Ligon%20FFT/</a></p><p>Please let me know what you think, as your opinion is held in highest<br/>regard.</p><p>&gt; Soon I will make available the sound of simultaneously played two<br/>&gt; digital drones on my site <a href="http://www.SoundOfIndia.com">www.SoundOfIndia.com</a>, in the key of C (or<br/>&gt; as close to C as the converting software will permit me to go).</p><p>This will be wonderful!

I believe, at one point, you<br/>said<br/>&gt; it was...</p><p>Joseph,</p><p>Glad you&apos;ve enjoyed them.</p><p>Yes, the TX81Z is one of several synths that may come into play in<br/>creating these drones. Obviously, with it&apos;s resolution of 1.56 steps,<br/>it will not be able to create a perfect harmonic series. To me<br/>though, this gives them character.</p><p>A basic method for using the TX81Z, is to:</p><p>1.    Create a TX81Z sine wave patch with slow attack and infinite<br/>sustain, with all 8 notes of polyphony given to a single voice.<br/>2.    Use Scala to create a Harmonic Series Tuning for your synth, on<br/>middle C, (or your targeted preference).<br/>3.    Use your sequencer to create 3 arpeggiated midi tracks (long as<br/>you like), where you use harmonics 1-16 on track 1, 1-8 on track 2, 1-<br/>4 on track 3. (Tip: Use a sustain pedal.). Here you will want to use<br/>your sequencer to draw in velocities to attenuate the desired higher<br/>harmonics.<br/>4.    Also record a select patch to use as a pedal tone, which the<br/>harmonic arpeggiations will move against.<br/>5.    Record one at a time, all of the above parts as audio.<br/>6.    Add to taste, into each part desired DSP - reverbs, delays,<br/>subtle filtering, phase shifting, eq&apos;ing.<br/>7.    Use the paste mix function of Sound Forge (or a DAW) to mix all<br/>of the resulting tracks together into a pleasing mix. Alternately,<br/>transpose into other keys if needed, with Sound Forges pitch<br/>transpose function.</p><p>This is but one of many schemes for doing this. One can also use<br/>Sound Forge (as Pat P. has said) to generate sines for harmonics.<br/>Granular Synthesis is also highly effective in creating movement in<br/>the harmonics.  I haven&apos;t tried Glandular Synthesis yet, as I&apos;m<br/>afraid to get icky stuff on my keyboard.</p><p>Thanks for your interest,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/10/2001 9:15:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20045">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20045</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; A basic method for using the TX81Z, is to:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.

This is a sound aesthetic that I like to turn onto many<br/>things, which I feel makes the music endrue repeated listening.</p><p>Thanks for your continued interest,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>3/10/2001 12:13:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I realize what you have done.
