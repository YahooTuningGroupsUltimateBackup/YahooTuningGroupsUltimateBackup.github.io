The<br/>only downside is programming.</p><p>I also saw on the site some custom job with a separate ztar<br/>keyboard/fretboard. That gave me the idea for what I call the &apos;Stick&apos; which<br/>is a long fretboard with say 24/36 frets on it just like the ztar is now. At<br/>the bottom are some controls, and somewhere would be a midi port or similar<br/>for programming etc, or the programming is done &apos;on board&apos; - much better<br/>idea. Room for batteries in behind I suppose, or power can come from the<br/>midi cable.</p><p>You play it like a viol or &apos;cello, but with one big difference - both hands<br/>can be used for tapping on the velocity sensitive keys, which I suppose<br/>could also respond to aftertouch.</p><p>rubbish idea or brilliant - ?</p><p>Mark G</p></div><h3><a id=39773 href="#39773">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2002 6:16:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>M,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; rubbish idea or brilliant - ?</p><p>I&apos;ve always thought the Chapman Stick was an underutilized, very valuable instrument.
