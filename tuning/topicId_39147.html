E.g. make any of the hexanies<br/>1 3 5 7, 1 3 7 11, 1 5 7 11, etc.</p><p>To use this first you need to install Virtual Flower and Fractal Tune Smithy,<br/>and the most up to date versions of both, from<br/><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk">http://tunesmithy.co.uk</a></p><p>Then run Virtual Flower and go to Output | Musical Geometries.</p><p>No help for it yet, so I&apos;ll just say here what you do:</p><p>Choose what to make from the drop list of templates. Choose what factors you<br/>want in the list (the first few get used, as many as are needed).</p><p>Then click Make Model, Make Clips, and finally, Show Model to see the result.</p><p>Here the Make Clips needs a bit more explanation as it is done in<br/>FTS rather than VF.</p><p>What you do is to start FTS up and choose the voice you want to use from the Voices menu,<br/>also set the pitch of the 1/1 from the Pitch... menu<br/>(defaults to flute and concert pitch middle c, so you can just leave it at<br/>those - if you have just recently been playing a fractal tune, use File | New to get back<br/>to the defaults).</p><p>Back in Virtual Flower, click Make Clips... and FTS will then make them<br/>all for you. It plays them all and records them to .wav format, which<br/>obviously will take a while (needs full duplex soundcard too) so just<br/>leave it running until it has made them all.</p><p>Then click Show model to see the result.</p><p>You can also make them as midi clips, which is faster - but not recommended<br/>if you use the latest version of Cortona as it seems to have a midi bug in it<br/>as it misses the first notes of short clips, and also it will slow down<br/>the computer so that eventually it stops responding if you try to show a<br/>model with many midi clips in it. You might then need to reboot.</p><p>Hope they fix it as it used to work fine with midi clips before,<br/>just a few months ago. They haven&apos;t replied to my bug report about this yet, so<br/>if anyone else feels like mentioning it to them too, couldn&apos;t hurt...<br/>(or mention it in their sound node forum where I&apos;ve posted about it).</p><p>If one keeps to .wav format then the Cortona behaves excellently and there<br/>is no delay.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
