Any opinions that don&apos;t come off that way are only the<br/>province of the momentarily deranged author and should be taken in<br/>the spirit off good will, regardless!  :)</p><p>Now to work:</p><p>Finally, I had the opportunity to ingest and, hopefully digest, Julia<br/>Werntz&apos; _Perspectives of New Music_ article.  It&apos;s rather a<br/>shame that _Perspectives_ doesn&apos;t make it a bit easier to procure<br/>this stuff.  Why should we have to take out a full-year $40<br/>subscription just to get one earlier issue of the mag??  Well, enough<br/>bitching, there&apos;s more to come.</p><p>Frankly, I applaud Julia for her inclusion in the publication.  I<br/>know they are quite discriminating, but whether they are really all<br/>*that* discriminating concerning microtonal articles is yet another<br/>question!  After all, the previous articles on microtonality appeared<br/>over 10 years ago!</p><p>Regardless, curiously enough, the most interesting thing about<br/>Julia&apos;s article is her musical examples!  Her music really<br/>doesn&apos;t look as &quot;academic&quot; as one might surmise by her<br/>repeated insistence of the avoidance of any low-integer ratio<br/>harmonic relationships, by serialism or whatever.  Actually, the<br/>short examples of her work seem rather tonal but in the sense of a<br/>linear deviation from a tone.  This process is also seen in the work<br/>of her teacher Joe Maneri and in his music, also illustrated, it also<br/>seems somewhat &quot;anti academic.&quot;  Why is this??  Because to my<br/>mind, even though Julia is constantly changing 72-tET pitches in this<br/>music, she still keeps pretty much linearly to her starting place!<br/>That establishes a tonal center, in the sense of the presence of a<br/>frequency range of tones, and it&apos;s something for the ear to grasp<br/>onto!  So, really this is somewhat different from totally serialized<br/>or randomized music.</p><p>As a fellow 72-tetter, and I really should emphasize this, since I am<br/>also rather die-hard about this system at this point, and I feel that<br/>72-tetters should really stick together (just like the little tones<br/>might stick together) I find it rather curious that she should use<br/>and maintain 72-tET in her work rather than any other system.<br/>According to Julia, the use of 72 is only because (pg 185)<br/>&quot;partly because it is the system of temperament used by Maneri<br/>(whose music so uniquely demonstrates the potential of this branch of<br/>microtonalism), but also because its intervals are sufficiently small<br/>to illustrate the general issues that I believe are important.....<br/>However there is nothing sacred about the number seventy-two...&quot;<br/>Clearly, according to Julia, the number could be 72 or 48 or 30 (as<br/>she mentions) and it really doesn&apos;t make any difference.</p><p>This is where I would part company.  I would say that even in the<br/>most random explication of music created with 72-tET the distinct<br/>harmonic relationships that are so close to many of the low-integer<br/>intervals would exert a &quot;gravitational pull...&quot;  And,<br/>personally, unlike Julia, I believe this is one of the<br/>&quot;charms&quot; not a defect of this particular temperament.</p><p>Like Paul Erlich, I wish Julia had concentrated on just describing<br/>her own method of composition with 72, the second half of the<br/>article, and refrained from &quot;dumping&quot; on all kinds of<br/>composers in the first half, in a tirade that I believe is incredibly<br/>specious on the overall.</p><p>Yet, it&apos;s not so bad as the ridiculous short extract of her<br/>dissertation that is available for public consumption (and why is<br/>that exactly??) but it is still pretty intellectually spurious.</p><p>The assumption is that any composer trying for just intonation<br/>effects in his/her music is going to write, by necessity, a kind of<br/>puerile triadic pabulum.  Now, what is that assumption based upon?<br/>According to Julia, it&apos;s due to the fact that just intonation<br/>composers would only use a very limited palette, since any larger-<br/>integer ratios would not be acceptably free from beating for use by<br/>the initiated.  So, in this scenario, where do we place a composer<br/>like La Monte Young, who uses upper-limit JI?  Where do we really<br/>place Lou Harrison, one of the greatest composers of our time (value<br/>judgment) with all the multiplicity of approaches he&apos;s shown over<br/>the years.  Where do we place Ben Johnston, with the intricate<br/>complexity and upper-relations of his splendid and AUDIBLE, AUDIBLE,<br/>AUDIBLE music with higher-limit partials??  No, this makes absolutely<br/>no sense whatsoever.</p><p>We can also refute this limited JI palette nonsense by the<br/>consideration of 72-tET as an adaptive just intonation system, as<br/>Paul Erlich has so aptly pointed out.  Linearly 72-tET is tempered<br/>but, horizontally, if people use the kind of interval training<br/>methods that I, personally, advocate (eliminating the syntonic and<br/>septimal commas against a drone to learn the 12th tone and 6th tone<br/>intervals) we have a kind of adaptive just that, in no way, has to<br/>stick with a very limited palette.  Indeed, even in my explorations<br/>with the quasi just intonation harmonic lattices of the Blackjack<br/>scale, a 21-pitch extract from the 72-tET continuum, I was able to<br/>involve ALL KINDS of consonances and dissonances, easily utilizing<br/>chords up to the 11-limit, which, at least to my ear, were more<br/>discordant than concordant!  That was an essential part of my fabric,<br/>although I was fully aware and intentionally utilized lower-limit<br/>consonances.</p><p>Indeed, like most composers I have certain preferences and biases and<br/>in this case I hold one very strongly:  music that has at least some<br/>elements of lower-integer ratios is audible resounding music, that<br/>has a corporal aspect that actually rings in the body and emotions.<br/>This is the element that is lacking in extended academic serial<br/>composition, the music that hoards of listeners have rejected time<br/>and again, and has almost caused if not already caused the death of<br/>contemporary music among audiences, certainly in this country and to<br/>a large degree in Europe as well.  Much of this music has failed.<br/>Audiences now gravitate to minimalism and popular-based music.<br/>Largely atonal music has failed to secure a following partially, I<br/>believe, because it does not resonate in the ears and the mind-body<br/>of the listeners.</p><p>Listen, I come from a background of somebody who used to perform<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s piano music publicly (I now, however, hate the<br/>piano).  I&apos;ve studied all that stuff and much of it, particularly<br/>by the masters, I enjoy.  However, so much of this kind of music has<br/>been created by &quot;paint by numbers&quot; imitators.  Fact is,<br/>it&apos;s easy music to write; all you need is a chart on the wall.  I<br/>remember a professor, when I was a TA (yes, I did at least that much<br/>of an academic stint) who got freshman who could barely play the<br/>guitar to write &quot;sophisticated&quot; 12-tones works by just<br/>referencing a<br/>chart.  Well, I have to admit, the pieces sounded no better or worse<br/>than the music of most &quot;professionals&quot; working in that genre!</p><p>So, it&apos;s obvious that the kind of music that I, personally, like<br/>is at least theoretically different from Julia&apos;s preferences.  (I<br/>doubt it even is in practice which lends even further lack of<br/>credence to her essay), but the most astonishing thing is the other<br/>musics that she has decided to &quot;dump on&quot; and assert are not<br/>the real microtonality:</p><p>By the way, I always hate it when people portentously (and rather<br/>pompously) insist on labeling music the true this and that.  How is<br/>that, indeed, any different from the True Believer&apos;s assertions<br/>of Just Intonation??</p><p>In this carnage, Julia manages to claim that Penderecki, Xenakis,<br/>Ligeti and Bartok are not using &quot;real, true&quot; microtonality.<br/>Penderecki, Xenakis and Ligeti because the usage is part of some<br/>larger structure that does not feature specific intervals, and Bartok<br/>because the usage is &quot;elaborative.&quot;  Now, please, who is the<br/>judge of all this??  Julia Werntz, I guess.  Come on.  Penderecki and<br/>Xenakis use wild non-twelvulated microtonality (who&apos;s ever heard<br/>of &quot;microtonalism&quot;) and, in particular, Xenakis created this<br/>music from GLISSANDI, the ULTIMATE microtonal sound!!!!  What BS.</p><p>And, on the other hand, who is really to say that Bartok, who<br/>emulates FOLK MUSIC in his work is not using microtonality?  Come<br/>on.  Folk music is microtonal!  It&apos;s not 12-equal, what is it??</p><p>All these artificial divisions and determinations are really what I<br/>feel is absolutely the worst part of Julia&apos;s essay.  I feel there<br/>is a need to &quot;create copy&quot; by setting up various &quot;straw<br/>people&quot; and dumping on them.</p><p>Why is all this necessary?  As Paul Erlich says, she should just<br/>write about the techniques she enjoys using and forget all the<br/>negativity which, I truly and firmly believe, has no rational (no pun<br/>intended) justification (no pun intended...)!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2002 3:06:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; We can also refute this limited JI palette nonsense by the<br/>&gt; consideration of 72-tET as an adaptive just intonation system, as<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich has so aptly pointed out.
