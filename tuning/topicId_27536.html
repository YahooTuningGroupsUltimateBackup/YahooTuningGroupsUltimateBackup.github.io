(Paul, Ed, Carl, am I right about this?)</p><p>Greetings,<br/>    You are right, to a degree.  The inharmonicity in a piano does require<br/>that the octave be pure at only one common partial,( pianos will usually have<br/> either a  2:1, 4:2 or a 6:3 alignment, depending on where that octave is).<br/>Putting 3.4 cents into the middle octaves of a piano would create some very<br/>busy thirds.  I normally keep the octave near pure(2:1) in the middle,<br/>allowing the stretch to increase as I go up.  The studio pianos do better<br/>with a tighter bass, since it causes less trouble with the Korg-tuned bass<br/>guitars....... (on the concert stage, I let the piano stretch more in the<br/>bass, giving as much purity to the triple octaves above as possible).<br/>    If carefully done, octaves can be stretched a lot more as you go up from<br/>the &quot;cash register&quot;(about the fifth octave), since the effects of temperament<br/>lessen as you move away from the middle three octaves of the piano.<br/>(Debussy&apos;s &quot;Clare de Lune&quot; opens with some thirds that are high enough to<br/>sound the same in virtually all tunings, while Plomp and Levelt demonstrated<br/>that there is no consonant third in the bottom two octaves).<br/>     Steinway stage tuners in New York have a tendancy to begin tuning pure<br/>fifths from near C5 on up. They speak of the additional &quot;brilliance&quot; and<br/>presence that this gives the sound, but they cannot even fathom why someone<br/>would not use 12 ET!
