By the time I got to the part where it modulates to G, I&apos;d forgotten the rest of it. But I&apos;ve got a few days vacation this week, so maybe I&apos;ll have time to figure out how it goes.</p><p>I did a crude MIDI rendition of it and put it up on my web site:</p><p><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/lemba2.mid">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/midi/lemba2.mid</a><br/><a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/mp3/lemba2.mp3">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/mp3/lemba2.mp3</a></p><p>One interesting thing is that most of these parallel sixths are actually parallel octaves on the keyboard, since I&apos;m using the 16-note per octave DE scale (i.e., two 8-note MOS per octave).</p><p>Here&apos;s the Scala files I used to tune this, first the scl file:</p><p>! lemba.scl<br/>!<br/>Lemba temperament (4 down, 3 up)<br/> 8<br/>!<br/> 90.92429<br/> 139.95064<br/> 230.87493<br/> 279.90128<br/> 370.82557<br/> 461.74985<br/> 510.77621<br/> 601.70049</p><p>and the kbm file to set it in the key of D:</p><p>! Linear mapping with D = 290 Hz<br/>! Size:<br/>0<br/>! First MIDI note number to retune:<br/>0<br/>! Last MIDI note number to retune:<br/>127<br/>! Middle note where scale degree 0 is mapped to:<br/>62<br/>! Reference note for which frequency is given:<br/>62<br/>! Frequency to tune the above note to (floating point e.g. 440.0):<br/>290.0<br/>! Scale degree to consider as formal octave:<br/>0</p></div>
