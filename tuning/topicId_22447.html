Please note that in my own usage, I have referred to<br/>C, an octave or octave-species of C-C, or the mode of &quot;C Ionian.&quot;</p><p>For many people, I realize, &quot;C major&quot; is simply synonymous with this<br/>octave, or the pattern T-T-S-T-T-T-S.</p><p>Here the complication is that for some of a medievalist viewpoint,<br/>speaking of &quot;C major&quot; seems to imply not only a reference note,<br/>octave, or modal octave-species, but also conventions of key tonality<br/>of a kind which one diplomatic formulation would propose were<br/>established &quot;sometime during or around the 17th century,&quot; tactfully<br/>leaving open the question of just when, where, by whom, and how.</p><p>Please let me express my regrets for any part I may have played in<br/>such a misunderstanding, especially since I might now suspect that the<br/>very interesting issues of verticality and modality/tonality in the<br/>Manneristic era may be tangential to the main points of this<br/>notational discussion.</p><p>In short, we seem in an agreeable consensus on these points:</p><p>(1) Ben Johnston&apos;s notational system is centered on C, taking as its<br/>default the syntonic diatonic as modelled by Zarlino, with D as the<br/>diatonic step requiring two versions a syntonic comma apart (81:80) in<br/>order to achieve pure fifths at both G-D and D-A;</p><p>(2) Choosing C as a reference point for a tuning system has a very<br/>long and respectable history in Western European theory, with Zarlino<br/>as a fine example of a JI theorist taking this approach both by<br/>precept and example; and</p><p>(3) One can recognize these points while leaving lots of room for<br/>different views on the roles of modality and/or tonality in music of<br/>the era 1540-1640, and similar questions.</p><p>Turning to the main question of JI notations, I might express my own<br/>point of view that there is no need for everyone to agree on a single<br/>system: it may be a matter both of taste and of the conceptual<br/>approach of a specific composer or school of composition.</p><p>For example, if the Ben Johnston notation assumes familiarity with a<br/>lattice basic to a piece, then such an assumption might well be a very<br/>convenient one for likely performers who either have this familiarity<br/>or would wish to gain it in the process of understanding both the<br/>music and the composer&apos;s approach to intonation.</p><p>A strange if not necessarily logical metaphor occurs to me for the<br/>notational dilemma we are discussing.</p><p>In an HEWM notation, the default is Pythagorean, one might say: fifths<br/>pure, and major thirds equal to four such fifths -- the same kind of<br/>situation, notationally, as musicians faced intonationally around 1450<br/>when tuning keyboards for emerging styles where pure or near-pure<br/>thirds were desired in as many positions of the gamut as possible.</p><p>In the Ben Johnston notation, the default is the syntonic diatonic<br/>with regularly spelled major thirds pure but a Wolf fifth among the<br/>diatonic notes -- a situation analogous to that in the JI tuning of<br/>Ramos (1482, Wolf at G-D), or Fogliano/Zarlino (1529/1558, Wolf at<br/>D-A).</p><p>Is there any kind of notational compromise here analogous to meantone<br/>temperament, maybe some kind of implicit &quot;adaptive tuning,&quot; which<br/>could let both fifths and thirds be pure by default? Might a composer,<br/>for example, give an indication like, &quot;There&apos;s a comma to be<br/>negotiated somewhere over the next x number of notes or sonorities --<br/>please adjust accordingly&quot;?</p><p>By the way, in this dialogue, I might suggest a clear distinction between<br/>the claim that the general scheme of the Ben Johnston follows the outlook<br/>of Fogliano and Zarlino, and the issue of how the fifth D-A was sung in<br/>16th-century practice, or should be sung now.</p><p>Zarlino&apos;s language suggests very strongly to me that whatever the default<br/>arrangement of large and small whole-tones (9:8 and 10:9), singers or<br/>other performers would make whatever adjustments might be required to<br/>produce pure concords, including fifths.</p><p>Vincenzo Galilei pokes fun of certain lutenists who use _tastini_ or<br/>&quot;little frets_ to seek more just thirds, but who stumble into impure<br/>fifths while attempting to negotiate the extra frets.</p><p>While these theorists are famous for their disagreements, on some<br/>intonational issues as well as others, they agree that singers avoid the<br/>kind of difficulties which the syntonic comma introduces on fixed-pitch<br/>instruments.</p><p>May I emphasize that a notation treating a default &quot;D-A&quot; as 40:27 does not<br/>necessarily imply that such an interval should actually be sung: either<br/>the notation might explicitly indicate each time that an adjustment is<br/>needed so as to achieve a pure fifth, or this adjustment might be left to<br/>the performers. The common medieval and Renaissance convention of writing<br/>a direct leap F-B (German F-H), with F-Bb (German F-B) &quot;understood&quot; as<br/>normally intended to avoid a melodic tritone, might serve as a kind of<br/>precedent.</p><p>In other words, if presenting the case for classic 5-limit JI in<br/>Renaissance music, I would argue that singers would choose whatever<br/>versions of the notes D-A might most aptly produce a pure fifth.</p><p>Similarly, someone who prefers a JI notation for music in this kind of<br/>style where a default C-E would be 81:64 is not necessarily advocating<br/>Pythagorean intonation as a 16th-century norm, but is likely advocating an<br/>approach where either each inflection to achieve 5:4 is noted, or where<br/>preformers are expected to make unwritten adjustments.</p><p>Since we are here discussing especially notations which _do_ seek to make<br/>the inflections explicit, the debate might be one mainly of which default<br/>is easier frequently to override, as must be done in order to combine pure<br/>ratios of 3 and 5.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=22662 href="#22662">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/13/2001 10:12:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22447.html#22447">/tuning/topicId_22447.html#22447</a></p><p>Many thanks to Margo Schulter for this important clarifying post<br/>regarding the Ben Johnston notation.
