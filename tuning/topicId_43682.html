All pencil on scrap paper (retrieved from<br/>neighbors&apos; recycling and trash bins).</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m making four bowed koto/zithers just now and am trying to<br/>&gt;design the bridges. They will act as a quartet in my wee orchestra, tuned<br/>&gt;to four hexanies, or two overlapping dekanies or the full Eikosany, depending<br/>&gt;on whether I make them with 5 or 6 strings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So I&apos;m fascinated by your project.</p><p>    Likewise.

Yet those at the top have typically<br/>stolen their position from others. They are the greatest thieves, because<br/>they have stolen the greatest amount of land and other property. So words<br/>about benevolence and righteousness are usually the fruit of robbery.&quot; -<br/>Chuang Tzu/Zhuangzi</p><p>&quot;O wise humanity, terribly wise humanity! Of thee I sing.

Life is for beauty and substance and sound and<br/>colour; and even those are often forbidden by law [socio-cultural<br/>conventions]. . . . Why not be free and live your own life?
