It runs 12 weeks, from February 2 to May 7.  We&apos;ve got an interesting crew of composers assembled, and are looking for a few more.</p><p>Tuition is $1500 for 12 weeks of intensive microtonal work in good company.  Scholarships and work study are available.  Money should not be a barrier to participation, so if this sounds like something you can&apos;t miss, let&apos;s talk!</p><p>Excitedly,<br/>Andrew Heathwaite, gtrpkt@...</p><p>The Short Description:  &quot;In this society, the available means for music-making are a product of the ruling musical system. To imagine anything different would be to invite the (im)possible tasks of designing new instruments, new orchestras, new human capacities, new concert formats. Microtonal design is a seminar for unsticking the ear and everything attached to it.&quot;</p></div>
