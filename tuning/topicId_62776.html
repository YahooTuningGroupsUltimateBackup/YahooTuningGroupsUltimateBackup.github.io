I guess that depends on your view and usage of just<br/>&gt; intonation. Here&apos;s something explaining one possible view which I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; basically use here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a preview discusses the diatonic scale and the decatonic (you<br/>&gt; can think of the latter as a 7-limit version of Messaien&apos;s 10-note<br/>&gt; MLT). The complete work will also cover the scales you&apos;re asking<br/>&gt; about as well as some impossible in 12-equal, such as Porcupine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You might want to read this too:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you amenable to these ways of thinking?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not knowing quite what you mean by &quot;the various 11s, 13s, 17s, 19s,<br/>&gt; etc.&quot;, I&apos;ll give you some 5- and 7-limit realizations:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The diminished/octatonic scale (Messaien 2nd) in the 5-limit can be<br/>&gt; considered a periodicity block with commatic unison vector 648:625<br/>&gt; (like all scales in the 5-limit diminished family) and chromatic<br/>&gt; unison vector 16:15, such as the Fokker block:</p><p>[YA] I have introduced approximate letter names<br/>below, in order to understand this better.</p><p>&gt; C    1/1<br/>&gt; C# 25/24<br/>&gt; Eb  6/5<br/>&gt; E    5/4<br/>&gt; F# 25/18<br/>&gt; G    3/2<br/>&gt; A    5/3<br/>&gt; Bb  9/5<br/>&gt; C    (2/1)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since you are free to transpose any of the notes by the commatic<br/>&gt; unison vector, we can allow for more consonant chords (4 major and 4<br/>&gt; minor triads instead of 3 of each) ...</p><p>[YA] What an intriguing idea!  It sounds like a nice<br/>way to expand our tonal resources - and in<br/>just intonation, too!</p><p>&gt; ... by providing an alternate pitch<br/>&gt; for each of two scale degrees by transposing by 648:625:</p><p>[YA] As above, I have introduced approximate letter<br/>names.  The alternate for C# is Db, 25/24 higher.<br/>Similarly, the alternate for F# is Gb, 25/24 higher.<br/>Including both &quot;alternates&quot; for C# and F# means<br/>that we actually need 10 pitches per octave to<br/>realise this tuning.</p><p>&gt; C      1/1<br/>&gt; Db 25/24 * 648/625 = 27/25<br/>&gt; Eb    6/5<br/>&gt; E      5/4<br/>&gt; Gb 25/18 * 648/625 = 36/25<br/>&gt; G     3/2<br/>&gt; A     5/3<br/>&gt; Bb   9/5<br/>&gt; C     (2/1)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This allows the just major triads<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1-5/4-3/2<br/>&gt; 6/5-3/2-9/5<br/>&gt; 36/25-9/5-27/25<br/>&gt; 5/3-25/24-5/4</p><p>[YA] That is, C, Eb, Gb and A major:<br/>C-E-G<br/>Eb-G-Bb<br/>Gb-Bb-Db<br/>A-C#-E</p><p>It&apos;s interesting to note that the roots of these chords<br/>(as might be expected from the symmetry of the scale<br/>construction) lie an exact 6/5 minor third (but not an<br/>exact quarter octave) apart.</p><p>Starting from A 5/3, the four minor thirds upwards are:<br/> - first C 1/1,<br/> - second Eb 6/5,<br/> - third Gb 36/25, and<br/> - fourth A&apos; 216/125.</p><p>A&apos; is an octave and 128/125 above the A we started on.<br/>128/125 = 640/625, which is quite a bit smaller than the<br/>comma 648/625 used to create the two alternate scale<br/>degrees.</p><p>So the roots of these four major chords are distributed<br/>almost symmetrically over the span of the octave,<br/>dividing it almost exactly into four quarters.  Very<br/>different from the way the three major chords of<br/>common practice are spread, with roots falling on C, F and<br/>G.  Altho the F and G are symmetric about C, the three<br/>roots do not divide the octave at all equally.  This very<br/>asymmetry lends more finality to common practice chord<br/>progressions favouring major chords in which the last<br/>movement of the root is upward [or downward] by a<br/>fourth.  The same kinds or quality of chord progression<br/>will not be available using only major chords in the<br/>octatonic scale, since the last movement of the root must<br/>necessarily be upward [or downward] by a minor third or<br/>tritone.  So we can confidently predict a more restless,<br/>less resolute, kind of harmonisation occurring in this<br/>context.</p><p>How do the implications of this tuning, with its four major<br/>chords, differ from those of 12-EDO with four major<br/>chords built on successive minor thirds C, Eb, Gb and A?</p><p>In the 12-EDO case, these four chords are:<br/>C-E-G<br/>Eb-G-Bb<br/>Gb-Bb-Db<br/>A-C#-E</p><p>which together require eight distinct notes:<br/>C-C#(=Db)-Eb-E-Gb-G-A-Bb</p><p>to play.</p><p>In the octatonic case, these four chords are:<br/>C-E-G<br/>Eb-G-Bb<br/>Gb-Bb-Db<br/>A-C#-E</p><p>which together require nine distinct notes:<br/>C-C#-Db-Eb-E-Gb-G-A-Bb</p><p>to play.</p><p>So it requires only one more pitch to create the scale<br/>supporting these chords in JI than in 12-EDO!  That&apos;s<br/>surprisingly little extra effort to provide, if we want to<br/>hear pure JI harmonies, and has most impact on fixed<br/>tuning instruments such as pianos, pipe organs and<br/>metallophones.  But were I moved to create tunes in<br/>octatonic (*) and harmonise them with major chords, it&apos;s<br/>great to know that a little &quot;adaptive JI&quot; could handle this<br/>effortlessly on most instruments, including human voices.</p><p>&gt; and the just minor triads<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/1-6/5-3/2<br/>&gt; 6/5-36/25-9/5<br/>&gt; 25/18-5/3-25/24<br/>&gt; 5/3-1/1-5/4</p><p>[YA] That is, C, Eb, F# and A minor:<br/>C-Eb-G<br/>Eb-Gb-Bb<br/>F#-A-C#<br/>A-C-E</p><p>To play the four major triads in C octatonic, we need<br/>both C# and Db; similarly, to play the four minor triads<br/>in C octatonic, we need both F# and Gb.  So far we need<br/>ten tones per octave to realise an octatonic scale in JI.</p><p>&gt; The diminished/octatonic scale in the 7-limit can be considered a<br/>&gt; periodicity block with commatic unison vectors 36:35 and 50:49 (like<br/>&gt; all scales in the 7-limit diminished family) and chromatic unison<br/>&gt; vector 16:15, ...</p><p>[YA]  (Paul goes on to describe the tetrads in the 7-limit<br/>octatonic in a similar fashion, and how we can have more<br/>of them by allowing commatic alternates for several<br/>notes.)</p><p>It should be possible to notate the 7-limit octatonic<br/>equally simply using letter-names (&quot;nominals&quot;) and<br/>accidentals or diacritics.  I expect that we should find<br/>that the same kind of adaptive JI, oriented toward the<br/>octatonic scale, would similarly be capable of expanding<br/>our range of expression.</p><p>How small is the difference, really, between C# and Db<br/>above in the 5-limit case?  The ratio is 648/625, so in<br/>cents, that&apos;s 1200 * (log 648 - log 625)/log 2, or<br/>62.565148 c.</p><p>Certainly, 63 cents is a very noticeable adjustment if<br/>made to a held tone!  Almost a third of a tone, in fact.</p><p>Db is 27/25, while D is usually taken as 9/8 which is<br/>just 25/24 higher.</p><p>So we have:<br/>C ......... 1/1 ............, * 25/24 .......... ==&gt; C#<br/>C# ..... 25/24 ...., * 648/625 .... ==&gt; Db<br/>Db ...... 27/25 ...., * 25/24 .......... ==&gt; D<br/>D ......... 9/8 .........., * 16/15 ........... ==&gt; Eb<br/>Eb ...... 6/5</p><p>The steps between these scale degrees &amp; alternates<br/>are:<br/>25/24 ............... C# .............. 70.672427 c<br/>648/625 ......... Db ............... 62.565148 c<br/>25/24 ............... D .................. 70.672427 c<br/>16/15 ................ Eb ................ 111.731285 c</p><p>(BTW, I defined a function in PowerToy Calc:<br/>  cents(r) = 1200 * ln(r) / ln(2)<br/>to do these conversions for me.  Windows users can<br/>download the PowerToys free from Microsoft.  To<br/>find the cents in any ratio r, first define the cents(r)<br/>function and save the definitions.  Then just type<br/>cents(r) in the Input box of the calculator, where r<br/>is your chosen ratio, eg 25/24, and the answer will<br/>appear, to more decimals than you&apos;ll ever need.)</p><p>The b sign marks the same distance down as the sharp<br/>marks up, namely 25/24 or around 71 cents, with the<br/>gap C#-Db being around 63 cents, giving an almost<br/>equal division of the 204 cent wholetone C-D into<br/>three parts.</p><p>(*) I think I&apos;ll try this, now that I know I can create<br/>a piece in C octatonic using only this standard notation<br/>for 10 pitches per octave:<br/>C-C#-Db-Eb-E-F#-Gb-G-A-Bb<br/>(0, 71, 133, 316, 386, 569, 631, 702, 884, 1018)</p><p>which I can tune on my MIDI keyboard directly, in<br/>cents relative to 12-EDO, as:<br/>C ............. C + 0 c<br/>C# ......... C# -29 c<br/>Db .......... D -71 c<br/>Eb ........... Eb +12 c<br/>E .............. E -14 c<br/>F# .......... F +69 c<br/>Gb ........... F# + 31c<br/>G .............. G +2 c<br/>A ............. A -16 c<br/>Bb ........... Bb +18c</p><p>This tuning of the 12-note keyboard octave does not<br/>use the keys commonly assigned to Ab and B.  So I<br/>need to avoid fingering them.  The nearest JI<br/>octatonic scale degrees, for both these keys, lie<br/>outside the -64 to + 64c variation available in tuning<br/>any key on this particular keyboard, so it is not<br/>possible to assign those keys to any scale degree of<br/>the JI octatonic rooted on C.</p><p>Note that the notation I&apos;ve chosen for this scale does<br/>not give a meaning to D, D#, E#, Fb, F, G#, Ab, A#,<br/>B# or Cb.</p><p>The advantage of Paul&apos;s realisation of this scale is that<br/>we can notate it &quot;normally&quot;, and use any MIDI notation<br/>software to record or generate a MIDI performance<br/>in this scale, together with a rich set of ready-made<br/>harmonies - all in Just Intonation.  I find this opens up<br/>some quite exciting possibilities!</p><p>Perhaps I should also look at what the tetrads offer,<br/>and whether they can be notated and played on the<br/>same keyboard.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.371 / Virus Database: 267.13.13/197 - Release Date: 9/12/05</p></div><h3><a id=62789 href="#62789">ðŸ”—</a>Yahya Abdal-Aziz &#x3C;yahya@melbpc.org.au&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2005 3:54:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think I&apos;ll try this, now that I know I can create<br/>&gt; a piece in C octatonic using only this standard<br/>&gt; notation for 10 pitches per octave:<br/>&gt; C-C#-Db-Eb-E-F#-Gb-G-A-Bb</p><p>&gt; (0, 71, 133, 316, 386, 569, 631, 702, 884, 1018)</p><p>&gt; which I can tune on my MIDI keyboard directly,<br/>&gt; in cents relative to 12-EDO, as:</p><p>C .............

The complete work will also cover the scales you&apos;re asking<br/>&gt; &gt; about as well as some impossible in 12-equal, such as Porcupine.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You might want to read this too:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Are you amenable to these ways of thinking?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not knowing quite what you mean by &quot;the various 11s, 13s, 17s,<br/>19s,<br/>&gt; &gt; etc.&quot;, I&apos;ll give you some 5- and 7-limit realizations:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The diminished/octatonic scale (Messaien 2nd) in the 5-limit can<br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; considered a periodicity block with commatic unison vector<br/>648:625<br/>&gt; &gt; (like all scales in the 5-limit diminished family) and chromatic<br/>&gt; &gt; unison vector 16:15, such as the Fokker block:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [YA] I have introduced approximate letter names<br/>&gt; below, in order to understand this better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; C    1/1<br/>&gt; &gt; C# 25/24<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb  6/5<br/>&gt; &gt; E    5/4<br/>&gt; &gt; F# 25/18<br/>&gt; &gt; G    3/2<br/>&gt; &gt; A    5/3<br/>&gt; &gt; Bb  9/5<br/>&gt; &gt; C    (2/1)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Since you are free to transpose any of the notes by the commatic<br/>&gt; &gt; unison vector, we can allow for more consonant chords (4 major<br/>and 4<br/>&gt; &gt; minor triads instead of 3 of each) ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [YA] What an intriguing idea!  It sounds like a nice<br/>&gt; way to expand our tonal resources - and in<br/>&gt; just intonation, too!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... by providing an alternate pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; for each of two scale degrees by transposing by 648:625:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [YA] As above, I have introduced approximate letter<br/>&gt; names.  The alternate for C# is Db, 25/24 higher.</p><p>You mean 648/625 higher, right?</p><p>&gt; Similarly, the alternate for F# is Gb, 25/24 higher.</p><p>Here also you mean 648/625 higher, yes?</p><p>&gt; Including both &quot;alternates&quot; for C# and F# means<br/>&gt; that we actually need 10 pitches per octave to<br/>&gt; realise this tuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; C      1/1<br/>&gt; &gt; Db 25/24 * 648/625 = 27/25<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb    6/5<br/>&gt; &gt; E      5/4<br/>&gt; &gt; Gb 25/18 * 648/625 = 36/25<br/>&gt; &gt; G     3/2<br/>&gt; &gt; A     5/3<br/>&gt; &gt; Bb   9/5<br/>&gt; &gt; C     (2/1)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This allows the just major triads<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/1-5/4-3/2<br/>&gt; &gt; 6/5-3/2-9/5<br/>&gt; &gt; 36/25-9/5-27/25<br/>&gt; &gt; 5/3-25/24-5/4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [YA] That is, C, Eb, Gb and A major:<br/>&gt; C-E-G<br/>&gt; Eb-G-Bb<br/>&gt; Gb-Bb-Db<br/>&gt; A-C#-E<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s interesting to note that the roots of these chords<br/>&gt; (as might be expected from the symmetry of the scale<br/>&gt; construction) lie an exact 6/5 minor third (but not an<br/>&gt; exact quarter octave) apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Starting from A 5/3, the four minor thirds upwards are:<br/>&gt;  - first C 1/1,<br/>&gt;  - second Eb 6/5,<br/>&gt;  - third Gb 36/25, and<br/>&gt;  - fourth A&apos; 216/125.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A&apos; is an octave and 128/125 above the A we started on.</p><p>Yahya, I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s incorrect:</p><p>(216/125)/(5/3) = 648/625.</p><p>&gt; 128/125 = 640/625, which is quite a bit smaller than the<br/>&gt; comma 648/625 used to create the two alternate scale<br/>&gt; degrees.</p><p>If it were smaller, this wouldn&apos;t make any sense. Thankfully, it&apos;s<br/>not smaller, it&apos;s &quot;just right&quot;: 648:625.</p><p>&gt; So the roots of these four major chords are distributed<br/>&gt; almost symmetrically over the span of the octave,<br/>&gt; dividing it almost exactly into four quarters.  Very<br/>&gt; different from the way the three major chords of<br/>&gt; common practice are spread, with roots falling on C, F and<br/>&gt; G.</p><p>Welcome to the diminished scale! You should also try tuning it to the<br/>8-note ring in the &apos;TOP Dimipent&apos; horagram in the paper I mailed you,<br/>which doesn&apos;t require any alternate notes, but aims at improving the<br/>harmonies relative to 12-equal.</p><p>&gt; Altho the F and G are symmetric about C, the three<br/>&gt; roots do not divide the octave at all equally.  This very<br/>&gt; asymmetry lends more finality to common practice chord<br/>&gt; progressions favouring major chords in which the last<br/>&gt; movement of the root is upward [or downward] by a<br/>&gt; fourth.  The same kinds or quality of chord progression<br/>&gt; will not be available using only major chords in the<br/>&gt; octatonic scale, since the last movement of the root must<br/>&gt; necessarily be upward [or downward] by a minor third or<br/>&gt; tritone.  So we can confidently predict a more restless,<br/>&gt; less resolute, kind of harmonisation occurring in this<br/>&gt; context.</p><p>Sometimes.</p><p>&gt; How do the implications of this tuning, with its four major<br/>&gt; chords, differ from those of 12-EDO with four major<br/>&gt; chords built on successive minor thirds C, Eb, Gb and A?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the 12-EDO case, these four chords are:<br/>&gt; C-E-G<br/>&gt; Eb-G-Bb<br/>&gt; Gb-Bb-Db<br/>&gt; A-C#-E<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which together require eight distinct notes:<br/>&gt; C-C#(=Db)-Eb-E-Gb-G-A-Bb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; to play.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the octatonic case, these four chords are:<br/>&gt; C-E-G<br/>&gt; Eb-G-Bb<br/>&gt; Gb-Bb-Db<br/>&gt; A-C#-E</p><p>The first E can&apos;t be the same as the last E.</p><p>&gt; which together require nine distinct notes:<br/>&gt; C-C#-Db-Eb-E-Gb-G-A-Bb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; to play.</p><p>I think that&apos;s ten.</p><p>&gt; So it requires only one more pitch to create the scale<br/>&gt; supporting these chords in JI than in 12-EDO!</p><p>I think that&apos;s two more pitches. Meanwhile, if you&apos;re only looking at<br/>the major triads, the diatonic scale requires zero more pitches.</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s<br/>&gt; surprisingly little extra effort to provide, if we want to<br/>&gt; hear pure JI harmonies, and has most impact on fixed<br/>&gt; tuning instruments such as pianos, pipe organs and<br/>&gt; metallophones.</p><p>But is it really still the same scale to your ears? Or does 648:625<br/>produce a note that sounds like a distinct *musical* pitch? To me,<br/>even 81:80, which is several times smaller than 648:625, doesn&apos;t<br/>sound right as a *melodic* unison.</p><p>&gt; But were I moved to create tunes in<br/>&gt; octatonic (*) and harmonise them with major chords, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; great to know that a little &quot;adaptive JI&quot; could handle this<br/>&gt; effortlessly on most instruments, including human voices.</p><p>With a more &quot;hard-core&quot; implementation of adaptive JI, you could cut<br/>the 648:625 distinction between different occurences of the same note<br/>down to a considerably smaller interval.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and the just minor triads<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1/1-6/5-3/2<br/>&gt; &gt; 6/5-36/25-9/5<br/>&gt; &gt; 25/18-5/3-25/24<br/>&gt; &gt; 5/3-1/1-5/4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [YA] That is, C, Eb, F# and A minor:<br/>&gt; C-Eb-G<br/>&gt; Eb-Gb-Bb<br/>&gt; F#-A-C#<br/>&gt; A-C-E<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To play the four major triads in C octatonic, we need<br/>&gt; both C# and Db; similarly, to play the four minor triads<br/>&gt; in C octatonic, we need both F# and Gb.  So far we need<br/>&gt; ten tones per octave to realise an octatonic scale in JI.</p><p>It was ten even for just the major triads.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The diminished/octatonic scale in the 7-limit can be considered a<br/>&gt; &gt; periodicity block with commatic unison vectors 36:35 and 50:49<br/>(like<br/>&gt; &gt; all scales in the 7-limit diminished family) and chromatic unison<br/>&gt; &gt; vector 16:15, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [YA]  (Paul goes on to describe the tetrads in the 7-limit<br/>&gt; octatonic in a similar fashion, and how we can have more<br/>&gt; of them by allowing commatic alternates for several<br/>&gt; notes.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It should be possible to notate the 7-limit octatonic<br/>&gt; equally simply using letter-names (&quot;nominals&quot;) and<br/>&gt; accidentals or diacritics.  I expect that we should find<br/>&gt; that the same kind of adaptive JI, oriented toward the<br/>&gt; octatonic scale, would similarly be capable of expanding<br/>&gt; our range of expression.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How small is the difference, really, between C# and Db<br/>&gt; above in the 5-limit case?  The ratio is 648/625, so in<br/>&gt; cents, that&apos;s 1200 * (log 648 - log 625)/log 2, or<br/>&gt; 62.565148 c.</p><p>You got it right this time!</p><p>&gt; Certainly, 63 cents is a very noticeable adjustment if<br/>&gt; made to a held tone!  Almost a third of a tone, in fact.</p><p>Indeed. That was my point above.</p><p>&gt; Db is 27/25, while D is usually taken as 9/8 which is<br/>&gt; just 25/24 higher.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So we have:<br/>&gt; C ......... 1/1 ............, * 25/24 .......... ==&gt; C#<br/>&gt; C# ..... 25/24 ...., * 648/625 .... ==&gt; Db<br/>&gt; Db ...... 27/25 ...., * 25/24 .......... ==&gt; D<br/>&gt; D ......... 9/8 .........., * 16/15 ........... ==&gt; Eb<br/>&gt; Eb ...... 6/5</p><p>But D isn&apos;t part of this scale.</p><p>&gt; The steps between these scale degrees &amp; alternates<br/>&gt; are:<br/>&gt; 25/24 ............... C# .............. 70.672427 c<br/>&gt; 648/625 ......... Db ............... 62.565148 c<br/>&gt; 25/24 ............... D .................. 70.672427 c<br/>&gt; 16/15 ................ Eb ................ 111.731285 c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (BTW, I defined a function in PowerToy Calc:<br/>&gt;   cents(r) = 1200 * ln(r) / ln(2)<br/>&gt; to do these conversions for me.  Windows users can<br/>&gt; download the PowerToys free from Microsoft.  To<br/>&gt; find the cents in any ratio r, first define the cents(r)<br/>&gt; function and save the definitions.  Then just type<br/>&gt; cents(r) in the Input box of the calculator, where r<br/>&gt; is your chosen ratio, eg 25/24, and the answer will<br/>&gt; appear, to more decimals than you&apos;ll ever need.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The b sign marks the same distance down as the sharp<br/>&gt; marks up, namely 25/24 or around 71 cents, with the<br/>&gt; gap C#-Db being around 63 cents, giving an almost<br/>&gt; equal division of the 204 cent wholetone C-D into<br/>&gt; three parts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (*) I think I&apos;ll try this, now that I know I can create<br/>&gt; a piece in C octatonic using only this standard notation<br/>&gt; for 10 pitches per octave:<br/>&gt; C-C#-Db-Eb-E-F#-Gb-G-A-Bb<br/>&gt; (0, 71, 133, 316, 386, 569, 631, 702, 884, 1018)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which I can tune on my MIDI keyboard directly, in<br/>&gt; cents relative to 12-EDO, as:<br/>&gt; C ............. C + 0 c<br/>&gt; C# ......... C# -29 c<br/>&gt; Db .......... D -71 c<br/>&gt; Eb ........... Eb +12 c<br/>&gt; E .............. E -14 c<br/>&gt; F# .......... F +69 c<br/>&gt; Gb ........... F# + 31c<br/>&gt; G .............. G +2 c<br/>&gt; A ............. A -16 c<br/>&gt; Bb ........... Bb +18c<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This tuning of the 12-note keyboard octave does not<br/>&gt; use the keys commonly assigned to Ab and B.  So I<br/>&gt; need to avoid fingering them.  The nearest JI<br/>&gt; octatonic scale degrees, for both these keys, lie<br/>&gt; outside the -64 to + 64c variation available in tuning<br/>&gt; any key on this particular keyboard, so it is not<br/>&gt; possible to assign those keys to any scale degree of<br/>&gt; the JI octatonic rooted on C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that the notation I&apos;ve chosen for this scale does<br/>&gt; not give a meaning to D, D#, E#, Fb, F, G#, Ab, A#,<br/>&gt; B# or Cb.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The advantage of Paul&apos;s realisation of this scale is that<br/>&gt; we can notate it &quot;normally&quot;, and use any MIDI notation<br/>&gt; software to record or generate a MIDI performance<br/>&gt; in this scale, together with a rich set of ready-made<br/>&gt; harmonies - all in Just Intonation.  I find this opens up<br/>&gt; some quite exciting possibilities!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps I should also look at what the tetrads offer,</p><p>The &apos;TOP Dimisept&apos; 8-note scale might satisfy a taste for better<br/>tetrads than the 12-equal version of this scale (the octatonic or<br/>diminished scale) can offer, without requiring any alternate pitches.</p><p>&gt; and whether they can be notated and played on the<br/>&gt; same keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Yahya</p><p>Have you pursued this approach for the plain old diatonic case?<br/>There, it works much better, in that the alternates are much closer<br/>together, but the melodic unisons between alternates still don&apos;t work<br/>for my ears.</p><p>Also the decatonic case (both this and the diatonic case are<br/>discussed in my paper below) may be of interest to you:</p><p><a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf</a></p></div><h3><a id=62812 href="#62812">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/13/2005 5:27:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi again,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Further correction:  playing with the keyboard<br/>&gt; in this tuning, I found that F# major is unplayable.<br/>&gt; Why?

(You&apos;re so predictable! :-) )</p><p>&gt; &gt; Including both &quot;alternates&quot; for C# and F# means<br/>&gt; &gt; that we actually need 10 pitches per octave to<br/>&gt; &gt; realise this tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C      1/1<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Db 25/24 * 648/625 = 27/25<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Eb    6/5<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; E      5/4<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Gb 25/18 * 648/625 = 36/25<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; G     3/2<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; A     5/3<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Bb   9/5<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; C     (2/1)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This allows the just major triads<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1/1-5/4-3/2<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 6/5-3/2-9/5<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 36/25-9/5-27/25<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5/3-25/24-5/4<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [YA] That is, C, Eb, Gb and A major:<br/>&gt; &gt; C-E-G<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb-G-Bb<br/>&gt; &gt; Gb-Bb-Db<br/>&gt; &gt; A-C#-E<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s interesting to note that the roots of these chords<br/>&gt; &gt; (as might be expected from the symmetry of the scale<br/>&gt; &gt; construction) lie an exact 6/5 minor third (but not an<br/>&gt; &gt; exact quarter octave) apart.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Starting from A 5/3, the four minor thirds upwards are:<br/>&gt; &gt;  - first C 1/1,<br/>&gt; &gt;  - second Eb 6/5,<br/>&gt; &gt;  - third Gb 36/25, and<br/>&gt; &gt;  - fourth A&apos; 216/125.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A&apos; is an octave and 128/125 above the A we started on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahya, I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s incorrect:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (216/125)/(5/3) = 648/625.</p><p>Oops!  OK, you got it.  So, we can now say:<br/>&quot;A&apos; is an octave and a (648/125) comma above the A we<br/>started on.&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt; 128/125 = 640/625, which is quite a bit smaller than the<br/>&gt; &gt; comma 648/625 used to create the two alternate scale<br/>&gt; &gt; degrees.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If it were smaller, this wouldn&apos;t make any sense. ...</p><p>Yep, that&apos;s what  I thought, too ...</p><p>&gt; ... Thankfully, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; not smaller, it&apos;s &quot;just right&quot;: 648:625.</p><p>Fantastic!</p><p>&gt; &gt; So the roots of these four major chords are distributed<br/>&gt; &gt; almost symmetrically over the span of the octave,<br/>&gt; &gt; dividing it almost exactly into four quarters.  Very<br/>&gt; &gt; different from the way the three major chords of<br/>&gt; &gt; common practice are spread, with roots falling on C, F and<br/>&gt; &gt; G.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Welcome to the diminished scale! ...</p><p>Well, _of course_ I&apos;ve already played with the diminished<br/>scale in 12-EDO ...!  Also noted its restless harmonies.</p><p>&gt; ... You should also try tuning it to the<br/>&gt; 8-note ring in the &apos;TOP Dimipent&apos; horagram in the paper I mailed you,<br/>&gt; which doesn&apos;t require any alternate notes, but aims at improving the<br/>&gt; harmonies relative to 12-equal.</p><p>At what cost to the octave?  Not too much, I hope,<br/>or it wouldn&apos;t be &quot;just right&quot; ... Yes, I have it now - the<br/>tempered octave of TOP Dimipent is just 3.36 cents flat.<br/>Audible, but not maddening in fast passages.</p><p>How good, in TOP Dimipent, are the harmonies of the<br/>same four major and four minor chords on roots C, Eb,<br/>F# and A?  How do they compare with the &quot;harmonic<br/>octatonic&quot;, or &quot;octatonic with alternates&quot;, that you<br/>proposed?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Altho the F and G are symmetric about C, the three<br/>&gt; &gt; roots do not divide the octave at all equally.  This very<br/>&gt; &gt; asymmetry lends more finality to common practice chord<br/>&gt; &gt; progressions favouring major chords in which the last<br/>&gt; &gt; movement of the root is upward [or downward] by a<br/>&gt; &gt; fourth.  The same kinds or quality of chord progression<br/>&gt; &gt; will not be available using only major chords in the<br/>&gt; &gt; octatonic scale, since the last movement of the root must<br/>&gt; &gt; necessarily be upward [or downward] by a minor third or<br/>&gt; &gt; tritone.  So we can confidently predict a more restless,<br/>&gt; &gt; less resolute, kind of harmonisation occurring in this<br/>&gt; &gt; context.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sometimes.</p><p>Turning it around ... I know I can&apos;t achieve quite the same<br/>sense of finality or resolution in a cadence with roots on<br/>the diminished seventh chord.  I&apos;ve spent half an hour this<br/>morning trying to get a really satisfying cadence.  Maybe<br/>I&apos;m just a &quot;perfect fifth&quot; junkie after all!</p><p>&gt; &gt; How do the implications of this tuning, with its four major<br/>&gt; &gt; chords, differ from those of 12-EDO with four major<br/>&gt; &gt; chords built on successive minor thirds C, Eb, Gb and A?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the 12-EDO case, these four chords are:<br/>&gt; &gt; C-E-G<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb-G-Bb<br/>&gt; &gt; Gb-Bb-Db<br/>&gt; &gt; A-C#-E<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; which together require eight distinct notes:<br/>&gt; &gt; C-C#(=Db)-Eb-E-Gb-G-A-Bb<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; to play.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the octatonic case, these four chords are:<br/>&gt; &gt; C-E-G<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb-G-Bb<br/>&gt; &gt; Gb-Bb-Db<br/>&gt; &gt; A-C#-E<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first E can&apos;t be the same as the last E.</p><p>That would be a (648/125) comma above it, then,<br/>or E&apos;.  Looks like I&apos;ll be mapping that to the unused<br/>F key then.</p><p>&gt; &gt; which together require nine distinct notes:<br/>&gt; &gt; C-C#-Db-Eb-E-Gb-G-A-Bb<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; to play.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that&apos;s ten.</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So it requires only one more pitch to create the scale<br/>&gt; &gt; supporting these chords in JI than in 12-EDO!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that&apos;s two more pitches. Meanwhile, if you&apos;re only looking at<br/>&gt; the major triads, the diatonic scale requires zero more pitches.</p><p>Sure, but the advantage of your tuning of the octatonic<br/>was that it supplied alternates for those notes necessary<br/>to make the given triads totally in (JI) tune.  Which is the<br/>only reason it attracted my attention in the first place.<br/>People who like rough harmonies are welcome to them; I<br/>prefer something smoother when possible.</p><p>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; surprisingly little extra effort to provide, if we want to<br/>&gt; &gt; hear pure JI harmonies, and has most impact on fixed<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning instruments such as pianos, pipe organs and<br/>&gt; &gt; metallophones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But is it really still the same scale to your ears? Or does 648:625<br/>&gt; produce a note that sounds like a distinct *musical* pitch? To me,<br/>&gt; even 81:80, which is several times smaller than 648:625, doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; sound right as a *melodic* unison.</p><p>Of course not!  It&apos;s 20.5 cents, after all, which<br/>is way too big a mistuning to ignore, even in speed.<br/>Seems to me that there are two ways to use the<br/>resulting set of pitches - (1) as an adaptive JI<br/>with notes that sometimes must move by a whole<br/>(648/125) comma in order to maintain harmony;<br/>(2) as a scale with more than eight notes (at last<br/>count I was up to ten, so now it&apos;s eleven), some<br/>separated by the (648/125) comma, and good<br/>harmonisations for only some scale degrees.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But were I moved to create tunes in<br/>&gt; &gt; octatonic (*) and harmonise them with major chords, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; great to know that a little &quot;adaptive JI&quot; could handle this<br/>&gt; &gt; effortlessly on most instruments, including human voices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With a more &quot;hard-core&quot; implementation of adaptive JI, you could cut<br/>&gt; the 648:625 distinction between different occurences of the same note<br/>&gt; down to a considerably smaller interval.</p><p>What particular kinds of implementation did you<br/>have in mind?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; and the just minor triads<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1/1-6/5-3/2<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 6/5-36/25-9/5<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 25/18-5/3-25/24<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5/3-1/1-5/4<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [YA] That is, C, Eb, F# and A minor:<br/>&gt; &gt; C-Eb-G<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb-Gb-Bb<br/>&gt; &gt; F#-A-C#<br/>&gt; &gt; A-C-E<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To play the four major triads in C octatonic, we need<br/>&gt; &gt; both C# and Db; similarly, to play the four minor triads<br/>&gt; &gt; in C octatonic, we need both F# and Gb.  So far we need<br/>&gt; &gt; ten tones per octave to realise an octatonic scale in JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was ten even for just the major triads.</p><p>So now it&apos;s eleven.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; The diminished/octatonic scale in the 7-limit can be considered a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; periodicity block with commatic unison vectors 36:35 and 50:49<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (like all scales in the 7-limit diminished family) and chromatic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; unison vector 16:15, ...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [YA]  (Paul goes on to describe the tetrads in the 7-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; octatonic in a similar fashion, and how we can have more<br/>&gt; &gt; of them by allowing commatic alternates for several<br/>&gt; &gt; notes.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It should be possible to notate the 7-limit octatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; equally simply using letter-names (&quot;nominals&quot;) and<br/>&gt; &gt; accidentals or diacritics.  I expect that we should find<br/>&gt; &gt; that the same kind of adaptive JI, oriented toward the<br/>&gt; &gt; octatonic scale, would similarly be capable of expanding<br/>&gt; &gt; our range of expression.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How small is the difference, really, between C# and Db<br/>&gt; &gt; above in the 5-limit case?  The ratio is 648/625, so in<br/>&gt; &gt; cents, that&apos;s 1200 * (log 648 - log 625)/log 2, or<br/>&gt; &gt; 62.565148 c.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You got it right this time!</p><p>Score one for the Yo-yo! :-)</p><p>&gt; &gt; Certainly, 63 cents is a very noticeable adjustment if<br/>&gt; &gt; made to a held tone!  Almost a third of a tone, in fact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed. That was my point above.</p><p>Indeed.  The question becomes: if you&apos;re stuck with it,<br/>what can you do with it?  I&apos;ve given two approaches<br/>above.  I think I&apos;d tend to use the second, if only<br/>because it&apos;s hard to avoid using notes that are just lying<br/>there, waiting for us to take notice of them.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Db is 27/25, while D is usually taken as 9/8 which is<br/>&gt; &gt; just 25/24 higher.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So we have:<br/>&gt; &gt; C ......... 1/1 ............, * 25/24 .......... ==&gt; C#<br/>&gt; &gt; C# ..... 25/24 ...., * 648/625 .... ==&gt; Db<br/>&gt; &gt; Db ...... 27/25 ...., * 25/24 .......... ==&gt; D<br/>&gt; &gt; D ......... 9/8 .........., * 16/15 ........... ==&gt; Eb<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb ...... 6/5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But D isn&apos;t part of this scale.</p><p>Didn&apos;t mean to imply that it was ... just working out<br/>the numbers, and how I should notate 27/25.  At<br/>first, I chose to label it C#&apos;, ie one (648/625)<br/>comma above C#.  But when I noticed that it was as<br/>far below D as C# was above C, it seemed more<br/>logically to use the b as a sort of negative #.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The steps between these scale degrees &amp; alternates<br/>&gt; &gt; are:<br/>&gt; &gt; 25/24 ............... C# .............. 70.672427 c<br/>&gt; &gt; 648/625 ......... Db ............... 62.565148 c<br/>&gt; &gt; 25/24 ............... D .................. 70.672427 c<br/>&gt; &gt; 16/15 ................ Eb ................ 111.731285 c<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (BTW, I defined a function in PowerToy Calc:<br/>&gt; &gt;   cents(r) = 1200 * ln(r) / ln(2)<br/>&gt; &gt; to do these conversions for me.  Windows users can<br/>&gt; &gt; download the PowerToys free from Microsoft.  To<br/>&gt; &gt; find the cents in any ratio r, first define the cents(r)<br/>&gt; &gt; function and save the definitions.  Then just type<br/>&gt; &gt; cents(r) in the Input box of the calculator, where r<br/>&gt; &gt; is your chosen ratio, eg 25/24, and the answer will<br/>&gt; &gt; appear, to more decimals than you&apos;ll ever need.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The b sign marks the same distance down as the sharp<br/>&gt; &gt; marks up, namely 25/24 or around 71 cents, with the<br/>&gt; &gt; gap C#-Db being around 63 cents, giving an almost<br/>&gt; &gt; equal division of the 204 cent wholetone C-D into<br/>&gt; &gt; three parts.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (*) I think I&apos;ll try this, now that I know I can create<br/>&gt; &gt; a piece in C octatonic using only this standard notation<br/>&gt; &gt; for 10 pitches per octave:<br/>&gt; &gt; C-C#-Db-Eb-E-F#-Gb-G-A-Bb<br/>&gt; &gt; (0, 71, 133, 316, 386, 569, 631, 702, 884, 1018)</p><p>[At this point, I had forgotten that I also needed A#<br/>to make F# major.]</p><p>&gt; &gt; which I can tune on my MIDI keyboard directly, in<br/>&gt; &gt; cents relative to 12-EDO, as:<br/>&gt; &gt; C ............. C + 0 c<br/>&gt; &gt; C# ......... C# -29 c<br/>&gt; &gt; Db .......... D -71 c<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb ........... Eb +12 c<br/>&gt; &gt; E .............. E -14 c<br/>&gt; &gt; F# .......... F +69 c<br/>&gt; &gt; Gb ........... F# + 31c<br/>&gt; &gt; G .............. G +2 c<br/>&gt; &gt; A ............. A -16 c<br/>&gt; &gt; Bb ........... Bb +18c<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This tuning of the 12-note keyboard octave does not<br/>&gt; &gt; use the keys commonly assigned to Ab and B.  So I<br/>&gt; &gt; need to avoid fingering them.  The nearest JI<br/>&gt; &gt; octatonic scale degrees, for both these keys, lie<br/>&gt; &gt; outside the -64 to + 64c variation available in tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; any key on this particular keyboard, so it is not<br/>&gt; &gt; possible to assign those keys to any scale degree of<br/>&gt; &gt; the JI octatonic rooted on C.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Note that the notation I&apos;ve chosen for this scale does<br/>&gt; &gt; not give a meaning to D, D#, E#, Fb, F, G#, Ab, A#,<br/>&gt; &gt; B# or Cb.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The advantage of Paul&apos;s realisation of this scale is that<br/>&gt; &gt; we can notate it &quot;normally&quot;, and use any MIDI notation<br/>&gt; &gt; software to record or generate a MIDI performance<br/>&gt; &gt; in this scale, together with a rich set of ready-made<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonies - all in Just Intonation.  I find this opens up<br/>&gt; &gt; some quite exciting possibilities!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Perhaps I should also look at what the tetrads offer,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &apos;TOP Dimisept&apos; 8-note scale might satisfy a taste for better<br/>&gt; tetrads than the 12-equal version of this scale (the octatonic or<br/>&gt; diminished scale) can offer, without requiring any alternate pitches.</p><p>If it needs no alternates, then it automatically solves<br/>the problem of the large amount of &quot;adapatation&quot;<br/>needed by the JI octatonic-with-alternates.  My<br/>only remaining concern would be the quality of the<br/>harmonies.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and whether they can be notated and played on the<br/>&gt; &gt; same keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you pursued this approach for the plain old diatonic case?<br/>&gt; There, it works much better, in that the alternates are much closer<br/>&gt; together, but the melodic unisons between alternates still don&apos;t work<br/>&gt; for my ears.</p><p>So, to your ears, JI diatonic requires too much<br/>adaptation for the alternate notes to be considered<br/>essentially the same?  Are there any tunings in which<br/>adaptive JI &quot;works&quot; for you?</p><p>&gt; Also the decatonic case (both this and the diatonic case are<br/>&gt; discussed in my paper below) may be of interest to you:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/erlich-tFoT.pdf</a></p><p>Of course it will.  I remember being quite interested<br/>in this paper the first time I read it.  Perhaps, now<br/>having come head to head with the pain of adaptive<br/>JI, I will get some new insights from rereading it.</p><p>Since I&apos;ve now spent some hours trying to make<br/>listenable, playable music in the adaptive JI octatonic,<br/>and have been unhappy with the melodic progressions<br/>in particular, it&apos;s good to have some other possibilities<br/>that offer better hope of both good harmony and good<br/>melody together.</p><p>Paul, thanks for all the trouble you&apos;ve taken to comment<br/>on my fumbling (micro) steps in Tuning Land.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.371 / Virus Database: 267.13.13/200 - Release Date: 14/12/05</p></div><h3><a id=62897 href="#62897">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/15/2005 2:20:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; (216/125)/(5/3) = 648/625.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oops!

In jazz, the octatonic scale is often played as a single chord --<br/>one diminshed seventh chord a major seventh higher than another --<br/>but resolves to a tonic not in that scale.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; So it requires only one more pitch to create the scale<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; supporting these chords in JI than in 12-EDO!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think that&apos;s two more pitches.

You should also try tuning it to the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 8-note ring in the &apos;TOP Dimipent&apos; horagram in the paper I mailed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you, which doesn&apos;t require any alternate notes, but aims at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; improving the harmonies relative to 12-equal.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; At what cost to the octave?  Not too much, I hope,<br/>&gt; &gt; or it wouldn&apos;t be &quot;just right&quot; ... Yes, I have it now - the<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered octave of TOP Dimipent is just 3.36 cents flat.<br/>&gt; &gt; Audible, but not maddening in fast passages.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you prefer, stretch the entire tuning so that octaves are pure.</p><p>That&apos;s yet _another_ temperament to find<br/>the time to listen to!</p><p>&gt; &gt; How good, in TOP Dimipent, are the harmonies of the<br/>&gt; &gt; same four major and four minor chords on roots C, Eb,<br/>&gt; &gt; F# and A?  How do they compare with the &quot;harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; octatonic&quot;, or &quot;octatonic with alternates&quot;, that you<br/>&gt; &gt; proposed?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, that&apos;s exactly what I was hoping you&apos;d decide through<br/>&gt; listening. How would you like me to answer this question (what sense<br/>&gt; of &quot;good&quot; did you have in mind)?</p><p>Purity of concord.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Altho the F and G are symmetric about C, the three<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; roots do not divide the octave at all equally.  This very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asymmetry lends more finality to common practice chord<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; progressions favouring major chords in which the last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; movement of the root is upward [or downward] by a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fourth.  The same kinds or quality of chord progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not be available using only major chords in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; octatonic scale, since the last movement of the root must<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily be upward [or downward] by a minor third or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tritone.  So we can confidently predict a more restless,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; less resolute, kind of harmonisation occurring in this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; context.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Turning it around ... I know I can&apos;t achieve quite the same<br/>&gt; &gt; sense of finality or resolution in a cadence with roots on<br/>&gt; &gt; the diminished seventh chord.  I&apos;ve spent half an hour this<br/>&gt; &gt; morning trying to get a really satisfying cadence.  Maybe<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m just a &quot;perfect fifth&quot; junkie after all!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK. In jazz, the octatonic scale is often played as a single chord --<br/>&gt; one diminshed seventh chord a major seventh higher than another --<br/>&gt; but resolves to a tonic not in that scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So it requires only one more pitch to create the scale<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supporting these chords in JI than in 12-EDO!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think that&apos;s two more pitches. Meanwhile, if you&apos;re only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; looking at the major triads, the diatonic scale requires zero<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; more pitches.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sure, but the advantage of your tuning of the octatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; was that it supplied alternates for those notes necessary<br/>&gt; &gt; to make the given triads totally in (JI) tune.  Which is the<br/>&gt; &gt; only reason it attracted my attention in the first place.<br/>&gt; &gt; People who like rough harmonies are welcome to them; I<br/>&gt; &gt; prefer something smoother when possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Did you find the TOP Dimipent and stretched TOP Dimipent harmonies<br/>&gt; rough? And if you want pure harmonies, you can use adaptive JI, you<br/>&gt; don&apos;t need strict JI.</p><p>Although I&apos;ve spent much of my &quot;spare&quot; time this week<br/>on tuning the octatonic acceptably, I still haven&apos;t had<br/>time to try these.  Give me a little time.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surprisingly little extra effort to provide, if we want to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hear pure JI harmonies, and has most impact on fixed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tuning instruments such as pianos, pipe organs and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; metallophones.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But is it really still the same scale to your ears?

Does this not work for you for some reason?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; G .............. G# -64c</p><p>&gt; &gt; Because then that would be identical with this note, and you&apos;d<br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt; 10 notes, not 11 . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed it would, and I would have no Eb minor<br/>&gt; playable.</p><p>That should not happen.

Not too much, I hope,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or it wouldn&apos;t be &quot;just right&quot; ... Yes, I have it now - the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tempered octave of TOP Dimipent is just 3.36 cents flat.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Audible, but not maddening in fast passages.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you prefer, stretch the entire tuning so that octaves are pure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s yet _another_ temperament to find<br/>&gt; the time to listen to!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; How good, in TOP Dimipent, are the harmonies of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; same four major and four minor chords on roots C, Eb,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; F# and A?  How do they compare with the &quot;harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; octatonic&quot;, or &quot;octatonic with alternates&quot;, that you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; proposed?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, that&apos;s exactly what I was hoping you&apos;d decide through<br/>&gt; &gt; listening. How would you like me to answer this question (what<br/>sense<br/>&gt; &gt; of &quot;good&quot; did you have in mind)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Purity of concord.</p><p>Well, in that sense, I would assess the temperament as being perhaps<br/>a little better than in 12-equal, but still most of the way away from<br/>JI (as in the 10-pitch &quot;octatonic with alternates&quot; I proposed). If we<br/>had been discussing the diatonic scale or Messiaen&apos;s 10-note scale,<br/>though, the situation would be quite different, and a temperament<br/>much purer than 12-equal could be applied.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; comma in order to maintain harmony;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I guess my question is: don&apos;t these sound like different pitches<br/>&gt; &gt; entirely when they are so moved?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.</p><p>So music that is written in this scale, when retuned in this way,<br/>won&apos;t really sound like it&apos;s in any such scale any more, will it?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But were I moved to create tunes in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; octatonic (*) and harmonise them with major chords, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great to know that a little &quot;adaptive JI&quot; could handle this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effortlessly on most instruments, including human voices.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With a more &quot;hard-core&quot; implementation of adaptive JI, you<br/>could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cut the 648:625 distinction between different occurences of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same note down to a considerably smaller interval.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What particular kinds of implementation did you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; have in mind?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For example, you can pin the roots to 4-equal, and harmonize each<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; those purely within itself. This distributes the 648:625 &apos;comma&apos;<br/>into<br/>&gt; &gt; four 15.6 cent &apos;shifts&apos; which don&apos;t sound nearly as disturbing as<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; full 648:625 (62.6) cent shift.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, you would erect perfect fifths and major thirds<br/>&gt; over each of the 4-EDO roots?  Worth a try ...</p><p>That&apos;s a start (let me know if you want to get into more detail<br/>though) . . . Ideally, a computer would adjust the tuning of the note<br/>you play according to which chord you&apos;re holding down, so that you<br/>wouldn&apos;t need separate keys for all the alternate pitches . . .</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and whether they can be notated and played on the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have you pursued this approach for the plain old diatonic<br/>case?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There, it works much better, in that the alternates are much<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; closer together, but the melodic unisons between alternates<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still don&apos;t work for my ears.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So, to your ears, JI diatonic requires too much<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; adaptation for the alternate notes to be considered<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; essentially the same?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The strict JI approach does. The adaptive JI approach tyically<br/>&gt; &gt; distributes the syntonic comma into 4 unobjectionable shifts of<br/>5.4<br/>&gt; &gt; cents each.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Are there any tunings in which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; adaptive JI &quot;works&quot; for you?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Adaptive JI works great for me for diatonic music, while in many<br/>&gt; &gt; cases, strict JI doesn&apos;t.  I think you meant to ask about strict<br/>JI<br/>&gt; &gt; rather than adaptive JI?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was asking about the &quot;strict JI with alternates&quot;<br/>&gt; approach you outlined.</p><p>As I suspected. So . . .</p><p>&quot;Strict JI with alternates&quot; works for me for music in Miracle tunings<br/>and scales. I&apos;ve proposed several &quot;Blackjust&quot; scales inspired by this<br/>fact. Here&apos;s a centered one:</p><p><a href="/tuning/files/perlich/scales/blackjust4.g">/tuning/files/perlich/scales/blackjust4.g</a><br/>if</p><p>Each little tetrahedron in this lattice represents a 7-limit<br/>consonant tetrad. In Miracle temperament (specifically, the 21-note<br/>Blackjack scale), all of them are tuned very well, within 3 cents of<br/>JI. If you use the 21-note JI scale, only the colored intervals on<br/>the lattice are pure; the gray ones are &quot;out-of-tune&quot; by either<br/>2401:2400 (0.7 cents), 225:224 (7.0 cents), or 16875:16807 (7.7<br/>cents), as shown. But by adding new JI pitches to the original set of<br/>21, we may provide alternates to serve as &quot;corrections&quot; for all<br/>these &quot;errors&quot;, allowing us to keep all the tetrads pure. And the key<br/>point is that it&apos;ll still sound like the same basic melodic<br/>structure, as shifts of less than 8 cents don&apos;t tend to disturb that<br/>(say my ears).</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s fun going off on adventures, but OH!<br/>&gt; so tiring ....</p><p>Hope I&apos;m not contributing to tiring you! :) Keep it fun!!</p></div><h3><a id=62979 href="#62979">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Par&#xED;zek &#x3C;p.parizek@chello.cz&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2005 2:19:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul.<br/>You wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s my set of 10 pitches in cents:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              0<br/>&gt;          70.67<br/>&gt;         133.24<br/>&gt;         315.64<br/>&gt;         386.31<br/>&gt;         568.72<br/>&gt;         631.28<br/>&gt;         701.96<br/>&gt;         884.36<br/>&gt;        1017.60</p><p>Ah, I see.
