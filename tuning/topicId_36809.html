Some of the<br/>sounds are pretty good, a lot better than the awful onboard sound<br/>that came with my Hewlett Packard Pavilion 6355. I&apos;m creating a<br/>program now that will eventually play sounds with alternate tunings.<br/>At this point it will play sounds in 5 cent increments. I&apos;ve found<br/>that many of the pitches not equal to modern equal temperament notes<br/>produce a horrible tone quality. Move 5 cents up or down to a<br/>standard pitch and it sounds good.</p><p>Is this just poor wavetable software, or is this a typical problem?<br/>Thanks.</p></div>
