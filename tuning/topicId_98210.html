I wish that all of the people who get hung up on finding<br/>a near-just 5-limit non-meantone EDO would get over 53 and just go to<br/>34 instead. It has almost 20 less notes and is also very accurate in<br/>the 5-limit, and in many respects I actually prefer it 53-EDO. Namely<br/>because I really like the slightly sharp 17-EDO fifths, which I think<br/>are bright and colorful and awesome, and judging from George Secor and<br/>Margo Schulter&apos;s previous discussions on the matter I&apos;m not alone in<br/>this regard.</p><p>&gt; This chart is a compact version of what I started with, deleting unimportant EDOs, reducing from three decimals to one, formatting adjustments, etc. If anyone wants the big version for some reason, let me know, but I think this smaller one is a handier reference.</p><p>So this is all with reference to 24-TET?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98215 href="#98215">ðŸ”—</a>Callahan White &#x3C;cortaigne@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2011 12:08:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; 34 is great.

In fact, my original idea was for a 17-EDO guitar, but having crunched numbers like these and also having played with subsets on my keyboard and full scales with ThumbJam on my iPod touch, I found myself with a slight preference for 19 overall (despite its flat fifth). The main reason mathematically is that every interval in the subset of 19 that approximates 12-EDO does so better than the equivalent subset of 17 -- and as a bonus, it really nails 6:5. Even before I figured that out, though, I thought it had a more pleasant sound than 17.</p><p>&gt; So this is all with reference to 24-TET?</p><p>Functionally, that&apos;s the upshot, yes. The real idea was in reference to 12-EDO with the grey columns being the halfway spaces, so anything in those is sure to sound the most drastically unusual to the pinks. ;-)</p></div>
