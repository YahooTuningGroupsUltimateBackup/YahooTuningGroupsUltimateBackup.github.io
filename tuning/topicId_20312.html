Why is<br/>that?  Well, I certainly feel that the comma is eliminated in<br/>practice.  A neutral sixth could well be heard as a 13:8 rather than<br/>an 18:11, particularly when it&apos;s expanded to become 13:4 instead of<br/>36:11.  And the wolf fourth is more like 13:10 than any simpler ratio.<br/> So music in 31-equal that uses either of these intervals will be<br/>heard as 13-limit, like it or not.</p><p>It looks like 31-equal would be 15-limit consistent but for 13:11 and<br/>13:9.  13:12 and 13:15 are also so bad that they should generally be<br/>avoided.  However, this comma does imply both inconsistend intervals,<br/>so why is it still relevant?</p><p>You could take 1.3.5.7.9.11.15 and 1.3.5.7.13.15 as 15-limit subsets<br/>in which 31-equal is consistent.  Any chord required to be consonant<br/>should fit one of those subsets, and ideally avoid 3 and 15 from the<br/>second one.  So the 13:8 = 18:11 comma is used to connect the two<br/>systems.</p><p>I find the concept of xenharmonic bridges to be ideal here.  Think of<br/>1.3.5.7.9.11.15 and 1.3.5.7.13.15 as islands which are connected by<br/>the 13:8=18:11 bridge.  You can only be on one at a time, but the<br/>bridge will carry you between them.  More accurately, they are two<br/>peninsulas jutting out from the 1.3.5.7.15 land mass.</p><p>So we require the intervals each side of the = to belong to a<br/>consistent system, but not for them both to belong to the same system.</p><p>You can also add 41-equal to the list as a fully consistent tuning<br/>with this comma.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 15/14 = 14/13<br/>&gt; &gt; (comma eliminated:196/195)</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; Example tunings:19,31<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure either of these are consistent in the context.<br/>19-equal<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t consistent for 13/8, 7/4 and 14/13.  I can&apos;t find an<br/>inconsistency<br/>&gt; in 31, although it isn&apos;t consistent for the full 15-limit.</p><p>This comma does indeed lie within the 1.3.5.7.13.15 consistency island<br/>of 31-equal.  But as 19-equal is inconsistent for 1.7.13, that still<br/>shouldn&apos;t be on the list.  Put 41-equal in its place.</p><p>41-equal also works with 11:10 = 10:9 which was in Mats&apos; original post<br/>but not my reply.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=20341 href="#20341">ðŸ”—</a>M.

While the first letter of<br/>your name, Matt, appears in my text-based applications as a kind of<br/>Greek &quot;pi&quot; symbol or the like, I take it from your e-mail address that<br/>it may be some variety of &quot;O&quot; with an appropriate diacritical mark.<br/>Please let me know about the proper diacritical mark, if you like, so<br/>that I can at least approximate it if possible with some ASCII<br/>character.</p><p>Your discussion of commas and &quot;unison vectors&quot; prompts me to add some<br/>remarks regarding these ratios and compromises as they affect<br/>neo-Gothic tunings and music. One benefit of such a dialogue is that<br/>it may suggest how commas or dieses and the like may take on very<br/>different qualities and meanings depending on the stylistic setting.</p><p>For example, in many styles of European music from around 1450 to the<br/>present, a &quot;major third&quot; tends to suggest a ratio of around 5:4<br/>(~386.31 cents); in neo-Gothic music, a &quot;major third&quot; tends to suggest<br/>a ratio somewhere between around 81:64 (~407.82 cents) and 9:7<br/>(~435.08 cents).</p><p>As a result, people looking at the same tuning from these two points<br/>of view are very likely often to choose different intervals as &quot;the<br/>major third of this scale.&quot; In 46-tone equal temperament (46-tET), for<br/>example, from a Renaissance-Romantic viewpoint we would take 15/46<br/>octave or 21 fifths up (~391.30 cents) as the usual major third; from<br/>a neo-Gothic viewpoint, we would take the regular major third of 16/46<br/>octave or four fifths up (~417.39 cents), a virtually pure 14:11.</p><p>If viewpoints concerning basic definitions of interval categories can<br/>diverge in this manner, so may viewpoints on commas, dieses, or unison<br/>vectors. Here it may be helpful to propose a few definitions or<br/>clarifications of terms in a neo-Gothic setting.</p><p>In comparing regular tunings including equal divisions of the octave,<br/>we encounter an issue sometimes debated on the Tuning List: can the<br/>term &quot;meantone&quot; properly or felicitously be applied to positive<br/>tunings (with fifths larger than 700 cents), and especially to tunings<br/>with fifths wider than pure (e.g. 17-tET, 46-tET, 22-tET)?</p><p>People such as Dave Keenan and Paul Erlich have persuaded me that some<br/>other term for these very characteristic neo-Gothic tuning systems may<br/>be preferable, because historically the term &quot;meantone&quot; tends to imply<br/>specifically a _negative_ tuning designed to achieve or approximate<br/>regular major and thirds at 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>Here I would like to propose the related term _equitone_ for a<br/>positive, and especially Pythagorean or supra-Pythagorean tuning,<br/>where four fifths up produce a regular neo-Gothic major third,<br/>typically in the neighborhood ranging from around 81:64 to 9:7.<br/>As in meantones, so in equitones, a regular major third is equal to<br/>four fifths (minus two octaves), or two regular whole-tones (the<br/>&quot;mean-tones&quot; or &quot;equi-tones&quot; giving these tunings their name).</p><p>Also, I might propose the general term _lineotunings_ for negative<br/>meantones and positive equitones alike: these tunings share a<br/>&quot;lineolate&quot; structure with all intervals within a given octave derived<br/>from a chain of identical fifths, and these chains in different<br/>octaves form a kind of two-dimensional grid or network.</p><p>In the special case of an equal division of the octave, e.g. a<br/>meantone at 19-tET or 31-tET, or an equitone at 29-tET or 46-tET, we<br/>might speak of a _unilineotuning_, since here the octave is also<br/>derived from a single chain or &quot;line&quot; of fifths.</p><p>These are new terms, as far as I know, and may or may not be clear to<br/>interested readers, so I warmly invite questions, dialogue, and<br/>suggestions for refining concepts and definitions.</p><p>Also, in a modal neo-Gothic style, a given tuning does not necessarily<br/>have any definite &quot;tonic&quot; or &quot;1/1,&quot; but rather presents an assortment<br/>of natural or transposed finals (notes of repose) and cadential<br/>progressions. Thus the use of interval ratios in the style &quot;7:6&quot;<br/>rather than &quot;7/6&quot; may generally be preferable, although one might say,<br/>for example, &quot;in 22-tET, the mode of D Dorian has close approximations<br/>of a 7/6 and 12/7 in relation to the final.&quot;</p><p>An important point is that neo-Gothic music often prefers complex<br/>ratios, not necessarily related to harmonic partials but simply to<br/>&quot;interesting&quot; sonorities, for example &quot;supraminor/submajor&quot; thirds at<br/>or near 14:17:21. The concept is often one of a continuum of rational<br/>or irrational ratios.</p><p>Further, while supraminor and submajor thirds are often thus referred<br/>to as &quot;17-flavor&quot; intervals as a convenient shorthand, 14:17:21 is<br/>only one possible rational representation of a region of the continuum<br/>with various shadings and quite &quot;fuzzy&quot; borders. Other possible<br/>shadings could be represented by integer ratios such as 38:46:57<br/>(approximated in 29-tET) or 200:243:300 (not too far from 46-tET).</p><p>Here I focus on two ratios of special interest: 49:48 and 64:63.</p><p>-----</p><p>49:48 (~35.70 cents)<br/>7:6  vis-a-vis 8:7<br/>12:7 vis-a-vis 7:4</p><p>The presence of intermediate intervals somewhere between 8:7 and 7:6<br/>(e.g. ~15:13, a very large major second or very small minor third), or<br/>between 12:7 and 7:4 (e.g. ~26:15, a very large major sixth or very<br/>small minor seventh) is an intriguing and highly treasured property of<br/>a characteristic neo-Gothic tuning such as 29-tET, and also certain<br/>&quot;not-so-characteristic&quot; tunings such as 20-tET and 24-tET.</p><p>The ability of these intermediates to act either as a large major<br/>second or sixth expanding respectively to a fourth or octave, or as a<br/>small minor third or seventh contracting to a unison or fifth, makes<br/>possible various kinds of musical &quot;puns.&quot; Also, the sheer sonority and<br/>&quot;ambiguous&quot; quality of these intervals has an appeal all its own.</p><p>In 29-tET or 24-tET, where these intervals have ratios near 250 and<br/>950 cents (or ~15:13, ~26:15), they seem ideally to fill this<br/>ambiguous role. This is the typical neo-Gothic &quot;13-flavor&quot; exemplified<br/>by 29-tET.</p><p>However, in other tunings, intervals may lend themselves to both<br/>musical roles (8:7-7:6 or 12:7-7:4) while having a decided leaning or<br/>&quot;bias&quot; in one direction or the other.</p><p>A fine example is the intervals of 240 cents and 960 cents in 20-tET,<br/>which typically serve as large major seconds or small minor sevenths,<br/>but can also take the role of &quot;quasi-thirds&quot; contracting to unisons or<br/>&quot;quasi-sixths&quot; expanding to octaves. When used in the latter role,<br/>these intervals might be said to constitute a kind of &quot;super-13<br/>flavor.&quot;</p><p>With a large enough tuning set, a single tuning might offer both close<br/>approximations of 7-flavor ratios (e.g. 8:7 and 7:6, 12:7 and 7:4) and<br/>13-flavor alternatives. In Pythagorean tuning, while chains of 14<br/>fifths up and 15 fifths down give close approximations of 8:7 and 7:6,<br/>chains of 26 fifths up or 27 fifths down yield intervals of around<br/>250.83 cents and 247.21 cents, comparable to 24-tET and 29-tET.</p><p>-----</p><p>64:63 (~27.26 cents)<br/>9:8    vis-a-vis  8:7<br/>32:27  vis-a-vis  7:6<br/>81:64  vis-a-vis  9:7<br/>128:81 vis-a-vis 14:9<br/>27:16  vis-a-vis 12:7<br/>16:9   vis-a-vis  7:4</p><p>Just as negative meantones feature regular whole-tones somewhere<br/>between 9:8 and 10:9, so neo-Gothic equitones feature such whole-tones<br/>somewhere between 9:8 and 8:7.</p><p>Typical neo-Gothic tunings range from around Pythagorean to 22-tET. In<br/>Pythagorean, the whole-tone is a pure 9:8 and the septimal comma of<br/>64:63 may be approximated in larger tuning sets by the Pythagorean<br/>comma of 531441:524288 (~23.46 cents, a 3-7 schisma of ~3.80 cents<br/>smaller). In 22-tET, it is very slightly larger than the mean of 9:8<br/>and 8:7, producing regular major thirds (~436.36 cents) very close to<br/>a pure ratio of 9:7.</p><p>In the case of meantones, two tunings may especially receive attention<br/>as producing regular thirds with pure 5-based ratios:</p><p>1/4-comma meantone     pure 5:4 major third   (31-tET close)<br/>1/3-comma meantone     pure 6:5 minor third   (19-tET close)</p><p>By analogy, corresponding neo-Gothic equitones would be:</p><p>1/4-septimal-comma equitone   pure 9:7 major third   (22-tET close)<br/>1/3-septimal-comma equitone   pure 7:6 minor third   (27-tET close)</p><p>However, while 22-tET is notable as a neo-Gothic tuning combining<br/>approximate ratios of 3 and 7 in a regular &quot;equitonal&quot; structure (four<br/>fifths up are very close to 9:7, and three fourths up quite close to<br/>7:6), three factors may make it simply one temperament of interest,<br/>rather than a central focus of interest in the way that 1/4-comma<br/>meantone or 31-tET is as a negative tuning.</p><p>First, since the septimal comma is somewhat larger than the syntonic<br/>comma, an absolutely larger amount of temperament is required for<br/>1/4-septimal-comma (or 22-tET) than for 1/4-(syntonic)-comma (or<br/>31-tET) -- in fact, 22-tET (fifths ~7.14 cents wide) is comparable to<br/>the 19-tET approximation (fitths ~7.22 cents narrow) of 1/3-comma<br/>meantone.</p><p>Secondly, fifths and fourths are the primary concords of neo-Gothic<br/>music, so that their temperament may be felt more decidedly than in a<br/>meantone setting where thirds and sixths are the primary concords.</p><p>Thirdly, while meantone styles generally favor regular thirds quite<br/>close to the simple ratios of 5:4 and 6:5, neo-Gothic styles often<br/>favor such thirds with complex ratios, e.g. the Pythagorean 81:64 and<br/>32:27, or 21st-century variants such as 14:11 and 13:11, etc.</p><p>In a tuning such as 17-tET, which you mention, we have complex ratios<br/>which might be viewed as intermediate between Pythagorean and 7-based<br/>intervals, for example the regular minor third at 4/17 octave or<br/>~282.35 cents (~20:17), somewhere between 32:27 (~294.13 cents) and<br/>7:6 (~266.87 cents).</p><p>In other characteristic systems such as 29-tET, or a regular 12-note<br/>set of either 46-tET or the almost identical pure 14:11 equitone,<br/>complex thirds and sixths of various shadings are also the norm.</p><p>In larger tuning sets, &quot;7-flavor&quot; intervals differing from the regular<br/>ones by some variety of comma or diesis are common.</p><p>In a 24-note Pythagorean tuning, for example, the Pythagorean comma of<br/>531441:524288 (~23.46 cents) can also serve as an approximation of the<br/>64:63 comma (~27.26 cents), with the difference equal to a 3-7 schisma<br/>of around 3.80 cents. Thus 16 fifths up (~431.28 cents) serves as a<br/>near-9:7 major third, and 15 fourths up (~270.67 cents) as a near-7:6<br/>minor third, in addition to the regular 81:64 and 32:27.</p><p>In the e-based equitone with fifths at around 704.61 cents, where the<br/>whole-tone and diatonic semitone have a ratio of sizes equal to<br/>Euler&apos;s e (~2.71828), regular major and minor thirds have sizes of<br/>around 418.42 cents (a bit larger than 14:11) and 286.18 cents<br/>(somewhere between 33:28 and 13:11). In a 24-note tuning, we also have<br/>available &quot;7-flavor&quot; thirds formed from 13 fourths up (~440.11 cents)<br/>or 14 fifths up (~264.50 cents).</p><p>Thus while dispersing the 64:63 comma, as in 22-tET, is one available<br/>solution for obtaining 7-flavor ratios, and the ideal solution in a<br/>12-note tuning, other types of solutions involving some kind of comma<br/>or diesis are often favored for larger tuning sets, with 24 notes as a<br/>typical size. Here the multiple varieties of intervals, semitones, and<br/>cadential &quot;flavors&quot; are seen as a positive advantage.</p><p>However, given that tunings such as 20-tET (fifths at 720 cents,<br/>~18.04 cents wide) can be very effective for neo-Gothic music,<br/>especially in the right timbres, equitone temperaments at or near<br/>1/4-septimal-comma (e.g. 22-tET) or 1/3-septimal-comma (e.g. 27-tET)<br/>remain viable options along with more complex 7-flavor schemes.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=20528 href="#20528">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/28/2001 8:31:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Mats &Ouml;ljare&quot; &lt;oljare@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20312.html#20312">/tuning/topicId_20312.html#20312</a></p><p>Thanks so much, Mats, for posting this &quot;unison vectors&quot; material...<br/>it really summarizes some of the &quot;periodicity block&quot; procedures for<br/>me!</p><p>________ ______ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
