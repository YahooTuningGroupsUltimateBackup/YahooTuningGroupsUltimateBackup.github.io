Especially &apos;e&apos; with a wolf fifth on the fifth of the<br/>home key! But, Tom, you are right--to get a comprehensive test going,<br/>it would be good to have several pieces in several keys, and slower<br/>tempi are better than fast tempi as well....as for the sharps or flats<br/>key signature thing, I think to my knowledge Brad&apos;s squiggle<br/>temperament is the only example where sharps are worse than flats.<br/>They are usually equal in badness, or flats sometimes worse. I might<br/>be forgetting the particular specs of this or that temperament,<br/>though. Anyone with other, or counter- examples?</p><p>Anyway, I learned how subtle this all is by doing this, and I agree<br/>with Carl that we are often full of it when we talk about these<br/>things. Alot of the qualities of a temperament depend on, like Tom and<br/>others say, tempi, articulation, thickness of texture, brightness of<br/>timbre, inharmonicity of timbre, even room or reverb characteristics.<br/>Not news around here of course (think Sethares), but a fact we often<br/>forget when fighting about theoretical (mostly math) properties. I<br/>just don&apos;t trust what&apos;s on &apos;paper&apos; or &apos;.scl&apos; file about a tuning from<br/>this point on, that&apos;s for sure. The ear has to decide, in context, period.</p><p>I also see no point in not using a tuning that sounds good, whether<br/>&apos;historically accurate&apos; or not. Thus, if Gene likes 31-equal for Bach,<br/>why not? I listened to all the examples of Gene&apos;s---like Carl, I was<br/>surprised how well 31-equal &apos;worked&apos; in the sense that it didn&apos;t<br/>*scream* at me where it was! Also, for the sake of argument, if Johnny<br/>was &apos;proven&apos; wrong about WerckIII, it wouldn&apos;t make a difference--he<br/>likes it, his ear is turned on by it, therefore, he *should* make<br/>delightful performances with it. The opposite is true,<br/>too---&apos;anachronistic&apos; tunings should be &apos;valid&apos; in the same sense, if<br/>they are delicious to the ears!</p><p>I&apos;d like to do a related test where we use the &apos;aeolus&apos; pipe organ,<br/>choose a slow piece or piece(s), and have two temperaments battle it<br/>out, people vote, and then the winner advances to a challenger. An<br/>interesting question is if we can compare tuning that way---it might<br/>be a non-transitive relationship, who knows.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Krister Johnson&quot; &lt;aaron@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone else taking a stab at these?

Go right ahead and do that, by all means.  That reasonable range of modulation includes forays up to B major, F# major, C# major (variously as dominants or supplying scale-passagework), and it eventually works its way around to a G# minor section.</p><p>I played that piece on this concert:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/2005oct30.htm">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/2005oct30.htm</a><br/>confirming that it works brilliantly in my temp.  That was on a real pipe organ, using full principal chorus plus mixtures; and at bar 35 I added the trumpet stop; and at bar 40 I played the bass entrance with coupled-in pedal plus a 16-foot Posaune.  Even with all that brightness of timbre, the thing *still* seemed relatively relaxed without any uncomfortable intervals anyway; and that&apos;s despite having the E-G# be the widest major third in the temperament.  (For a comparable effect, listen to my recording of the Fischer E-major of _Ariadne musica_: same fugue subject and similar registration, pulling no punches on presenting the E major and B major chords as brightly as possible, with mixtures and reeds.  Play it &quot;good and loud&quot;, and in context of all of Fischer&apos;s 20 preludes/fugues for contrast.)</p><p>Then I took that WTC 2 piece and a pile of other Bach books over for a visit to Notre Dame University, nearby, and tried out this same WTC 2 E major fugue on their new Fritts organ.  It&apos;s in Kirnberger 3.  I tried several different registrations, including the full-great option and some quieter ones, and all of them didn&apos;t do very well at taking the bright/raucous edge off this piece&apos;s sharp-side modulations.  Good old B major, F# major, C# major, and G# minor.  Ouch.</p><p>Go ahead and try it likewise, on real organs and simulated organs and real harpsichords and simulated harpsichords.</p><p>This morning I took that piece to one of my harpsichords where I currently have a regular 1/6 comma set up.  I&apos;m using that temp to accompany some Telemann in a couple of weeks, for which it works perfectly (and it should, being Telemann&apos;s own system).  That&apos;s for an A-minor piece that happens to stick to only 12 notes, namely Bb-F-C...C#-G#-D#, so that&apos;s what I have set up, *regular* 1/6 with those 12 notes (with the shifting-around-the-wolf technique that Gene uses, hi Gene!).  Wolf D#-Bb.  So I played through this E major fugue on it, book 2.  It worked marvelously until bar 12, and even the several A#s before that weren&apos;t too bad as they happened in weak/passing moments.  But at bar 12 the E# was then horrible; at bar 15 the B#; and all the rest of the A#s and E#s and B#s through the end of the piece (and the accented wolf at bar 34 was awful).  Those three notes ruin it, for the simple reason that they&apos;re not available.  The several double-sharps starting in bar 33 *do* sound OK here, in part because they make pure tritones with other notes that are being played simultaneously.</p><p>One could &quot;do a Barbour&quot; still further here and retune the Bb, F, and C to be the correct 1/6 comma A#, E#, and B#.  Maybe even convert the G to an Fx.  But this would ruin the prelude, which does have some C and G naturals.  And the fugue itself uses both D natural and Cx (i.e. this straightforward piece uses 13 notes....).  Pick your poison: make some compromises off of regularity, or just let some of these sound lousy, or water-down the regularity to something wimpier than 1/6 comma, or build some split keys.</p><p>(All of which Tom obviously already knows!)</p><p>&gt;     ... or the much-discussed Prelude in E major, &apos;Book I&apos;;</p><p>Sure, why not?  Buy Peter Watchorn&apos;s set of the complete WTC book 1 to hear how it works through all 24 keys, including this one!  (Please, enough of this straw-man argument about E major allegedly being bad, in musical practice, just because its tonic triad happens to have the highest major 3rd!  Play the music--ALL OF IT--to experience how it works out.)</p><p>While we&apos;re at that Prelude in E major of book 1, go ahead and play the whole French Suite in E also, since it&apos;s together with that in one of the manuscripts.  My favorite bits, doing so, are the Sarabande and the Allemande: for the way they glisten but even bring a (surprising!) bit of plaintiveness as well...even with a wide-ish E-G#.</p><p>&gt; &gt;     Prelude, Courante I, II etc. from English Suite no.1 in A major;</p><p>Yes, one of my favorite suites, and I&apos;m playing its Allemande on *this* concert:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/2007mar13.htm">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/2007mar13.htm</a><br/>You&apos;ll note also that I&apos;m playing the Ab major and the B major back-to-back; and a whole A-major fugue (BWV 949) that scarcely modulates, right after the six-voiced Ricercar (C minor) that&apos;s been a bugaboo in Dr Lindley&apos;s older articles about acceptable Bach temperaments.  &quot;D-flat major approached in straightforward modulations&quot; and etc etc, observing that this Ricercar doesn&apos;t do too well with temps that peak at Db-F.</p><p>For the heck of it, this morning I flipped through my book to play a page of that Ricercar on the Telemann regular 1/6 comma (with D# as described above, and the only correct flat being Bb), and couldn&apos;t stand even a single bar of it.  Telemann of course was about taking the regular thing for a spin, five wraps around the spiral of 5ths and not picking merely a 12-note subset; but hey.  Whatcha gonna do without split keys?</p><p>&gt; &gt;     Fugue in D major, &apos;Book I&apos;; (easily audible 4 part harmony,<br/>&gt;     diametrically &apos;opposite&apos; to Ab major)<br/>&gt; &gt;     &amp; in general, slower-moving pieces with fuller harmony are more<br/>&gt;     exacting test of tuning, whereas the music we had so far is pretty<br/>&gt;     busy and often in only 2 or 3 parts. (Gene&apos;s BWV542 is the honorable<br/>&gt;     exception.)</p><p>Yes, good points.  And I&apos;ve assembled a large list of others, as well, at:<br/><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/testpieces.html">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/testpieces.html</a><br/>Have been doing for two years.</p><p>&gt; &gt;     Timbre is a problem, I would go for whatever was closest to an<br/>&gt;     acoustic instrument.

The test simply doesn&apos;t test music in sharp<br/>keys.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed that the test with this single piece (Ab major fugue WTC book 2)<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t &quot;test music in sharp keys&quot; especially well; but I disagree that<br/>&gt; &quot;it doesn&apos;t actually matter much if the chord is pleasantly-tuned&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     I don&apos;t think the single tonality Ab, even with wide<br/>modulation, can<br/>&gt; &gt;     be a reasonable test...

Go right ahead and do that, by all means.  That<br/>&gt; reasonable range of modulation includes forays up to B major, F# major,<br/>&gt; C# major (variously as dominants or supplying scale-passagework),<br/>and it<br/>&gt; eventually works its way around to a G# minor section.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I played that piece on this concert:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/2005oct30.htm">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/2005oct30.htm</a><br/>&gt; confirming that it works brilliantly in my temp.  That was on a real<br/>&gt; pipe organ, using full principal chorus plus mixtures; and at bar 35 I<br/>&gt; added the trumpet stop; and at bar 40 I played the bass entrance with<br/>&gt; coupled-in pedal plus a 16-foot Posaune.  Even with all that brightness<br/>&gt; of timbre, the thing *still* seemed relatively relaxed without any<br/>&gt; uncomfortable intervals anyway; and that&apos;s despite having the E-G# be<br/>&gt; the widest major third in the temperament.  (For a comparable effect,<br/>&gt; listen to my recording of the Fischer E-major of _Ariadne musica_: same<br/>&gt; fugue subject and similar registration, pulling no punches on<br/>presenting<br/>&gt; the E major and B major chords as brightly as possible, with mixtures<br/>&gt; and reeds.  Play it &quot;good and loud&quot;, and in context of all of Fischer&apos;s<br/>&gt; 20 preludes/fugues for contrast.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then I took that WTC 2 piece and a pile of other Bach books over for a<br/>&gt; visit to Notre Dame University, nearby, and tried out this same WTC 2 E<br/>&gt; major fugue on their new Fritts organ.  It&apos;s in Kirnberger 3.  I tried<br/>&gt; several different registrations, including the full-great option and<br/>&gt; some quieter ones, and all of them didn&apos;t do very well at taking the<br/>&gt; bright/raucous edge off this piece&apos;s sharp-side modulations.  Good<br/>old B<br/>&gt; major, F# major, C# major, and G# minor.  Ouch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Go ahead and try it likewise, on real organs and simulated organs and<br/>&gt; real harpsichords and simulated harpsichords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This morning I took that piece to one of my harpsichords where I<br/>&gt; currently have a regular 1/6 comma set up.  I&apos;m using that temp to<br/>&gt; accompany some Telemann in a couple of weeks, for which it works<br/>&gt; perfectly (and it should, being Telemann&apos;s own system).  That&apos;s for an<br/>&gt; A-minor piece that happens to stick to only 12 notes, namely<br/>&gt; Bb-F-C...C#-G#-D#, so that&apos;s what I have set up, *regular* 1/6 with<br/>&gt; those 12 notes (with the shifting-around-the-wolf technique that Gene<br/>&gt; uses, hi Gene!).  Wolf D#-Bb.  So I played through this E major<br/>fugue on<br/>&gt; it, book 2.  It worked marvelously until bar 12, and even the several<br/>&gt; A#s before that weren&apos;t too bad as they happened in weak/passing<br/>&gt; moments.  But at bar 12 the E# was then horrible; at bar 15 the B#; and<br/>&gt; all the rest of the A#s and E#s and B#s through the end of the piece<br/>&gt; (and the accented wolf at bar 34 was awful).  Those three notes ruin<br/>it,<br/>&gt; for the simple reason that they&apos;re not available.  The several<br/>&gt; double-sharps starting in bar 33 *do* sound OK here, in part because<br/>&gt; they make pure tritones with other notes that are being played<br/>&gt; simultaneously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One could &quot;do a Barbour&quot; still further here and retune the Bb, F, and C<br/>&gt; to be the correct 1/6 comma A#, E#, and B#.  Maybe even convert the<br/>G to<br/>&gt; an Fx.  But this would ruin the prelude, which does have some C and G<br/>&gt; naturals.  And the fugue itself uses both D natural and Cx (i.e. this<br/>&gt; straightforward piece uses 13 notes....).  Pick your poison: make some<br/>&gt; compromises off of regularity, or just let some of these sound<br/>lousy, or<br/>&gt; water-down the regularity to something wimpier than 1/6 comma, or build<br/>&gt; some split keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (All of which Tom obviously already knows!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     ... or the much-discussed Prelude in E major, &apos;Book I&apos;;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure, why not?  Buy Peter Watchorn&apos;s set of the complete WTC book 1 to<br/>&gt; hear how it works through all 24 keys, including this one!  (Please,<br/>&gt; enough of this straw-man argument about E major allegedly being bad, in<br/>&gt; musical practice, just because its tonic triad happens to have the<br/>&gt; highest major 3rd!  Play the music--ALL OF IT--to experience how it<br/>&gt; works out.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While we&apos;re at that Prelude in E major of book 1, go ahead and play the<br/>&gt; whole French Suite in E also, since it&apos;s together with that in one of<br/>&gt; the manuscripts.

Telemann of course was about taking the<br/>&gt; regular thing for a spin, five wraps around the spiral of 5ths and not<br/>&gt; picking merely a 12-note subset; but hey.

(Gene&apos;s BWV542 is the<br/>honorable<br/>&gt; &gt;     exception.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, good points.
