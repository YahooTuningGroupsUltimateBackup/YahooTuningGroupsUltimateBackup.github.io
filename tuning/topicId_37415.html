As i said, ET is what i believed was the right way to go. I would not state that JI is the one and only way to go even though  JI has inspired a &quot;messianic zeal&quot; in some, maybe many. I think we have all ran across this with other tuning systems also, such as the certain humorless non-et, non just proponents . Where i draw the line as a belief (to make it clear where my beliefs stand)  is that some acoustically base is needed. What this is not limited to<br/>simple JI ratios, but other acoustical phenomenon as well (difference tones for one). I am not convinced that we know all what is going on especially even on the objective level, much less on what happens when it is processed in our mind.  When someone tells me that, for instance, I like 72 or 13, or the lucy scale, what have you, I accept it as valid and that the listener is perceiving some acoustical phenomenon that might not be not apparent to my ears or understanding .<br/>    If you believe that if i was raised in another culture under different tunings (relating to different phenomenon) I would use  or be attracted to different phenomenon, I would totally agree. Much of what different tuning offer are different structural possibilities. Even on a purely numerical basis, I have explored JI tunings for their pure melodic possibilities freed from the concept of ratio size which you could state i can do in an ET, i subjectively like the unequal sizes of conjunct steps more than not :-). As what i understand you state (I have not gotten a copy yet) that much world music is anything but JI, I have also<br/>noticed it isn&apos;t an ET either. This means that we have allot to discover what is going on in our world and i applaud your adding of a different viewpoint because only in this climate can we get to the truths that confront us.<br/>    Regardless of however one would uses 72, it would help in the improvement of the hearing of pitch in our society. Much of the pitch fluctuation that occurs already with 12 ET we have been &quot;taught&quot; to be musically insignificant. I think we will better understand what others do when we ourselves bring our ears &quot;up to par&quot; hence also discovering what we ourselves have done without &quot;knowing&quot; or &quot;believing&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;jwerntz2002&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:juliawerntz@attbi.com">juliawerntz@attbi.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: response to Mark<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Kraig,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for your message. I have to disagree with you that it is not a matter of<br/>&gt; belief. When you say: &quot;i found that after a few years there was something about<br/>&gt; the sound i did not like or was not doing what i wanted it to do,&quot; and &quot;On the other<br/>&gt; hand, those scales i have tuned in JI i have never tired of and they have remained<br/>&gt; an inspiration to use,&quot; how can you then say that this is not a subjective experience<br/>&gt; (i.e. personal belief, or personal reaction)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Julia<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/2002 6:39:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/37415">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/37415</a></p><p>&gt;     Regardless of however one would uses 72, it would help in the<br/>improvement of the hearing of pitch in our society.

For<br/>me it&apos;s more fun sometimes to work with the microtonal *novices* in<br/>these cases!... if you can get over the *first* hurdles...[snide<br/>remarks, slightly rude behavior... and then they actually *learn* the<br/>piece!]</p><p>J.
