It starts with some synth that is *clearly* not 12-EDO. Since I&apos;m listening to it on Yahoo! Music (formerly LAUNCHCast), I can&apos;t rewind the track and play it over to try and figure out the tuning - so is anyone familiar with this one?</p><p>And now the violin solo starts, so I&apos;m listening to anything xenharmonic that might show up.</p><p>~Danny~</p></div><h3>Rich Holmes &#x3C;rsholmes@mailbox.syr.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2005 6:12:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:dawiertx@sbcglobal.net">dawiertx@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; writes:</p><p>&gt; Right now I&apos;m listening to the beginning of this album, released in 1973.

There are probably some untempered sounds from other (acoustic) noise making devices, and possibly some use of taped sound (ala musique concrete), and when they got into improv, the violin in particular would go off the map a bit.  But as far as I know, KC has never deliberately used a non-12-EDO tuning.  Fripp is well known for having developed a new guitar tuning, but that was years after this record was made, and it still uses 12-EDO - the difference is in the string-to-string intervals, which he bases on fifths rather than the standard fourths.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Rich Holmes wrote:<br/>&gt; &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:dawiertx@sbcglobal.net">dawiertx@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; writes:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Right now I&apos;m listening to the beginning of this album, released in 1973.
