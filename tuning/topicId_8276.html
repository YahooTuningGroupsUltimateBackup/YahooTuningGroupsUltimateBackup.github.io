It seems from the list that the implication<br/>is that Bach intended smooth chromatic runs in well-tempered Werkmeister<br/>and Mozart, born 6 years after Bach died, used an UNEVEN meantone system<br/>and all his chromatic runs were played unevenly in little &quot;grupetti.&quot;  Is<br/>this for real??  Come on. Do we have a Margo Schulter of the Classical<br/>Period lurking on this list -- or don&apos;t such types hang out on alternate<br/>tuning sites...  In any case, is it not true that Mozart&apos;s prank involved<br/>the use of his nose as an additional digit (??)  In this way, he could<br/>certainly &quot;thumb his nose&quot; at the limitations of not using his thumb...</p><p>J.

As I<br/>mentioned previously, I hope to summarize these books in some depth soon.</p><p>&gt; is that Bach intended smooth chromatic runs in well-tempered Werkmeister<br/>&gt; and Mozart, born 6 years after Bach died, used an UNEVEN meantone system<br/>&gt; and all his chromatic runs were played unevenly in little &quot;grupetti.&quot;  Is<br/>&gt; this for real??  Come on.</p><p>Chronology without geographic distinctions often leads to some confusion.<br/>The activities in protestant Saxony and Thuringia were largely unknown to<br/>composers of the next generation, and composers like Mozart and Haydn, in<br/>the catholic Austrian empire learned of Bach only little (howevermuch they<br/>were imressed by it) and late. Bach&apos;s tuning practice was very likely NOT<br/>transmitted to the Viennese.</p><p>Meantone continued in Northern Germany well after Sebastian Bach; the<br/>composers in the generation following his own (as well as his contemporaries<br/>Telemann, and H&#xFFFD;ndel,  the most influential composer of the era) generally<br/>restricted themselves to the resources of meantone. Bach&apos;s extravagant<br/>demands for modulation and key variety would not be matched until well into<br/>the 19th century.</p><p>I&apos;m increasingly convinced that the &quot;well-tempered&quot; era was actually a brief<br/>cul-de-sac (where the practitioners thought of themselves as essentially<br/>producing 12-tet)  and that the 19th century use of 12-tet arose instead<br/>from gradually spreading out the comma in meantone and that this came from<br/>the Viennese tradition. (I am assuming that by mature Beethoven the comma<br/>was already past the sixth-comma limit and that players heard the tuning as<br/>approximately equal).</p><p>As for the gruppetti, listen to some good recording using either historical<br/>instruments and performance practice or to any of the 20th century players<br/>in the Viennese tradition (there are too many to note -- of all people, I<br/>heard Friedrich Gulda on a memorial broadcast last night and there were the<br/>gruppetti -- but violinist Rudolph Kolisch is my favorite).</p></div>
