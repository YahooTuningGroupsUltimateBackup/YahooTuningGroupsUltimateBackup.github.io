I remember reading in the<br/>Craft &quot;Diaries&quot; that they went to a Noh Theatre performance in Japan  and<br/>were bored to tears  (though, to be fair, they said that most of the<br/>Japanese audience was also bored, and/or sleeping, during the<br/>performance).  I love Noh Theatre, so I just counted this as one of those<br/>A{FC}TDO  (Attitudes {of Famous Composers} That Depress One).
