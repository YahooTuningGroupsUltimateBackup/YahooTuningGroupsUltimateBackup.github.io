Splitting the quarter-comma meantone fifth in two steps of 5^(1/8) is therefore an excellent idea and 7/4 is mapped literally to a &quot;semidiminished 7th&quot;. This would be the best way of defending Vicentino&apos;s semichromatic steps that I have ever thought of. It even makes me speculate whether Vicentino was doing it really just for the sake of splitting the chroma and whether he hadn&apos;t actually considered involving 7/4s (without having told anyone).</p><p>#2:</p><p>[-1 -11 -1 0 6]</p><p>This suggests a &quot;sevenless&quot; 3D temperament of unmatched accuracy and rarely low complexity in the realm of microtemperaments.
