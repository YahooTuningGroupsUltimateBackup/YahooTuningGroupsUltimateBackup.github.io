Manually, as I&apos;ve heard from all of them, they managed to retune the<br/>synth in an octave space with a maximum detuning of +/-100 cents away from<br/>12-EDO (of course, this allows much better tuning possibilities than I can<br/>do on my Yamaha QS-300 as the XG format cannot apply greater detunings than<br/>+/-63 cents). Unfortunately, whatever I was trying to find some resources on<br/>the web, never have I seen a word about SysEx messages for retuning the Korg<br/>PA series. The same is true for Korg Triton (which one of my other friends<br/>also has). These synths have lots of great sounds and lots of great<br/>possibilities of processing them. And we all know they can also be played in<br/>non-12-EDO tunings. The only thing I&apos;m desperately looking for now is the<br/>format of the SysEx commands which can do this. Anyone can help me?</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
