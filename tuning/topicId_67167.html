So for some (but not all) musical purposes, the line at the center encodes all the needed information.  Neither Tenney nor I invented this line, which is just log-frequency space.<br/>&#x9;Typically, a (continuous) n-dimensional tuning lattice can be written as the product of a single line that represents log-frequency space and an (n-1) dimensional space whose meaning is a hard to interpret in the above sense.

This is just to say that we can represent chords of pitches as unordered collections of points in log-frequency space, and that voice leading distance is represented by the distance between one configuration and another.<br/>&#x9;The problem is that this representation doesn&apos;t perspicuously capture the natural music-theoretical idea that chords containing the pitch classes are similar objects: for instance {C4, E4, G4} and {C4, G4, E5} are represented by distinct configurations of points on the central axis, whereas -- for many (but not all) music-theoretical purposes -- it is useful to think of them as instances of the same object, the C major chord.</p><p>3) To this end, it is useful to represent chords as sets of unordered points on a circle, so that the C major chord is {C, E, G}, or {12, 4, 7} on the circumference of an ordinary clock face.  The problem with this representation is that it doesn&apos;t clearly depict the relation between a chord&apos;s internal structure and it&apos;s voice leading possibilities.<br/>&#x9;(Again, one could &quot;Tenney-ify&quot; the circle by adding additional dimensions, and then one could use these dimensions to draw tuning lattices of various sorts.

Regular temperaments are generated by a small set of intervals, and properties such as the overall error in a temperament are continuous functions of the sizes of those intervals.  You can also plot regular temperaments in a space of errors of prime intervals, which is analagous to the harmonic lattices.   One point represents just intonation, and the nearer a temperament gets to this point the more accurately it represents just intonation. Another idea is that all tunings related by a uniform scale stretch are equivalent, which is a kind of projective geometry.  In this space, each mapping of an equal temperament corresponds to a distinct point and you can find an equal temperament mapping arbitrarily close to any point in the space.</p><p>              Graham</p></div><h3><a id=67173 href="#67173">ðŸ”—</a>Dmitri Tymoczko &#x3C;dmitri@Princeton.EDU&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2006 7:52:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;A lattice, as I understand the algebraic definition, is a regular array<br/>&gt;of points embedded in some continuous space.

Simply put those commas in the kernel of a<br/>&gt; temperament, tune the *melodic* intervals of the music in<br/>&gt; that temperament, but tune the *harmonic* intervals in JI.<br/>&gt; You get an adaptive tuning solution that&apos;s optimal under whatever<br/>&gt; criteria you optimized the tuning of the temperament (I think).</p><p>You can even set impossible targets for the melodic intervals.  Or contextual things like leading tones being narrowed and consecutive intervals being clearly distinguished.</p><p>&gt; This can perhaps be further improved by tuning the attacks<br/>&gt; of all pitches to the temperament, and then bending them<br/>&gt; into JI some number of miliseconds later.  Some evidence<br/>&gt; suggests that perception of melody is more sensitive to attacks,<br/>&gt; and perception of dissonance more sensitive to duration.<br/>&gt; In any case, this is apparently what happens quite<br/>&gt; naturally in human chamber performances (Manuel has a cite).</p><p>That&apos;s something a synthesizer could implement if it&apos;s told the ideal harmonic and melodic pitches.  The problem I&apos;m thinking of is minimizing pitch shift and pitch drift of a large number of notes while maximizing consonance.  It&apos;s something John deLaubenfels was working on, and making good progress with.  But he had a classical model of springs that may or may not translate to a shortest-path geometric problem.  I think he used chord templates as well.  A more general algorithm would work with an arbitrary regular temperament class and an arbitrary consonance function, which is where the lattice might be useful.</p><p>                    Graham</p></div><h3><a id=67188 href="#67188">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2006 3:26:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dmitri Tymoczko &lt;dmitri@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 1) If we think of this space as continuous, then the X axis rather<br/>&gt; hard to interpret -- moving left or right doesn&apos;t change the pitch<br/>&gt; that&apos;s being represented in any way.

These lattices are discrete<br/>subgroups of a real normed vector space.</p><p>&gt; &gt;You could also consider the lattice distance as part of the voice<br/>&gt; &gt;leading distance.  It may be putting the cart before the horse, but<br/>&gt; &gt;intervals in the diatonic scale are usually favoured melodically.<br/>&gt; &gt;Minimizing steps on the spiral of fifths helps you to avoid them.

Another distinction which is very important and which the<br/>lattice capures is equal or unequal, as applied either to pitches or<br/>to pitch classes. Two chords sharing a note, or sharing an interval,<br/>is a fundamental relationsip very relevant to this question. Moreover,<br/>the lattice can be subjected to commatic equivalencies, and pitches or<br/>pitch classes glued together, and the same basis distinction between<br/>the same and not the same applied.</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t imagine measuring voice leading on the lattice.  On a 2x3<br/>&gt; lattice, the distance C4-&gt;G4 would be 1, while the distance C4-&gt;D4<br/>&gt; would be 3 (up two perfect fifths, and down one octave).  So anyone<br/>&gt; minimizing lattice distance would prefer lots of voices moving by<br/>&gt; perfect fifth to voices moving by step.  This might be useful for<br/>&gt; some purposes, but not voice leading, where steps are smaller than<br/>&gt; fifths.</p><p>One thing which is quite relevant to that, and which I&apos;ve actually<br/>often made use of for compositional purposes, is the extistence of<br/>linear mappings which are appoximately equal to the pitch map: equal<br/>temperament mappings for small numbers of notes to the octave. Given a<br/>chord with lattice information for each note, and an approximate<br/>tuning map (what I call a &quot;val&quot;) which is eg 4-equal or 5-equal, it is<br/>possible to add voice-leading relevant information to the tuning<br/>lattice mix.</p><p>&gt; If you want to study diatonic voice leading, the simplest thing to do<br/>&gt; is look at the diatonic lattice in my orbifolds.</p><p>I think orbifolds are by their very nature (generalizations of<br/>manifolds which have singular loci) are not going to be a simple way<br/>of looking at things.

(Note, by the way: a continuous pitch space is going to have a continuous group of intervals associated with it.) It&apos;s remarkable that the configuration space of a series of points in a one-dimensional pitch space is going to get you surprisingly close to familiar notions of harmonic distance.  It&apos;s not clear to me that we need traditional tuning lattices for this purpose.</p><p>The orbifolds I talk about in my paper are just configuration spaces of one-dimensional pitch and pitch classes.  Each point in one of my orbifolds represents a configuration of points on the one dimensional spaces.  It&apos;s a very cool fact that many common tonal notions of &quot;harmonic distance&quot; fall out of these spaces automatically.</p><p>For example: if you look at the 12 diatonic scales in the 7-dimensional space, they are naturally ordered by voice-leading proximity into a circular chain, where each scale shares 6 notes with its neighbors.  This is just the circle of fifths.</p><p>An exactly analogous structure exists in three-dimensional space.  If you use the diatonic metric on that space, you find that voice leading proximity groups the seven diatonic triads into a circular chain whose members share two notes with each of their neighbors.  In C major:</p><p>C - a -F - d - b dim - G - e - [C]</p><p>The analogy between this &quot;circle of triads&quot; and the traditional &quot;circle of fifth-related major scales&quot; is very, very deep.

This is what I was trying to say in my previous email.</p><p>For instance you can have a two-tiered hierarchical model, where the lowest level involves voice leading within some scale, and where the higher level involves scale-to-scale voice leadings.  (Thinking of a scale as itself a chord.)  As a very simple example, let&apos;s define harmonic distance as the number of one-step within-scale voice leading motions plus the number of single-semtitone scale-to-scale voice leading motions.  Let&apos;s further stipulate that scale-to-scale voice leading motions should only involve pitches not contained in the current chord.  This is equivalent to requiring that modulations involve a pivot chord.</p><p>So let&apos;s see how long it takes to get from C-E-G, understood as the tonic of C major, to C#-E#-G# under these circumstances.</p><p>CHORD&#x9;&#x9;SCALE<br/>C-E-G&#x9;&#x9;(C major)<br/>B-E-G&#x9;&#x9;(C major)<br/>B-E-G&#x9;&#x9;(G major)<br/>B-E-G&#x9;&#x9;(E minor)<br/>B-D#-F#&#x9;&#x9;(E minor -- counts as two steps)<br/>B-D#-F#&#x9;&#x9;(E major)<br/>B-D#-G#&#x9;&#x9;(E major)<br/>B-D#-G#&#x9;&#x9;(F# melodic minor ascending)<br/>C#-E#-G#&#x9;(F# melodic minor ascending -- counts as two steps)</p><p>So that&apos;s 11 steps, which is pretty far.</p><p>Obviously, one can refine this very simplistic method of calculating harmonic distance.

Usually, in tonal music, we&apos;re hearing relative to some scale.  Even if C#-F and Db-F were acoustically the same (as in an equal temperament), they&apos;re usually found in very different situations.  For instance, we might hear C#-F in a D minor context, so we&apos;re expecting two notes between them, whereas Db-F would be more common in F minor, where there&apos;s just one note between them.</p><p>Given these local contexts, we&apos;re going to be thinking and hearing in terms of scale steps.

The musical difference between C#-F and Db-F is greater than any intonational difference will be.  I guess I think that&apos;s as it should be, since what creates the important musical difference is actually the context, rather than the dyads in isolation.</p><p>&gt;My impression is that the orbifolds are not particularly adapted to<br/>&gt;analyse details of intonation.

C-E-G to C#-E#-G# is rare in classical music for at least two reasons:</p><p>1) The progression takes place in chromatic space, so it will tend to occur most frequently when composers are thinking about the chromatic scale as a primary object, rather than the diatonic.  This starts to occur frequently in the mid-nineteenth century.</p><p>2) In the most efficient voiceleading between these chords, every voice moves in parallel.</p><p>So, although C-E-G to C#-E#-G# has the virtue of efficiency, there&apos;s an easy story to tell about why it doesn&apos;t happen more often.</p><p>&gt;For various reasons the orbifolds seem neatest in equal temperament,<br/>&gt;due to symmetries of the tuning, therefore a logical next step would<br/>&gt;be to look at voice leading in 19EDO, 31EDO etc. or even<br/>&gt;neo-Pythagorean equal temperaments.</p><p>Well, they really are continuous spaces, so any scale is going to be represented by a lattice in the space.

Is there a recording/score available?</p><p>BTW, in a c-note equal temperament, the minimal voice leading between two n note chords related by transposition x is ||nx|| mod c.

I wish I knew of any<br/>discussion of the sound of diminished fourth triads in remote keys<br/>from the meantone era, because musicians then certainly encountered them.</p><p>&gt; Yes -- though over on tuning-math I&apos;ve been exploring the idea that<br/>&gt; voice leading considerations might suggest some other reasons why<br/>&gt; equal temperaments might be desirable -- roughly, they allow you to<br/>&gt; minimize the tuning&apos;s &quot;total error&quot; for every interval.</p><p>Thye minimize something, but I don&apos;t think &quot;total error&quot; is a good way<br/>to characterize what that is.</p><p>&gt; To me, there&apos;s not such a big issue here.

An alternative would be to ensure that ascending or descending on the staff follows ascending or descending in semitone-measured pitch height.  That&apos;s something you talk about in your key signatures paper, so make it more general and correct spelling is a matter of voice leading.  It also means everything goes in the right direction for all the various meantone tunings.</p><p>An interesting test case is Gesualdo.  A few years back I worked out a simple program to sort out the spelling of some of his more chromatic passages.  One of the main rules is that he&apos;s very strict about minimizing chords on the spiral of fifths.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=67299 href="#67299">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2006 7:29:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dmitri Tymoczko &lt;dmitri@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; then &quot;harmonic distance&quot; is a purely formal measure,<br/>&gt; &gt;depending only on notation?

These lattice-contexts express what&apos;s different<br/>&gt; between Db and C#.</p><p>I&apos;m almost convinced. My example of C-E-G to C#-E#-G# in &apos;normal&apos;<br/>Romantic harmony involved the keys of E or B, which do interpolate<br/>some sort of &apos;harmonic distance&apos; between the two chords. For Haydn Eb<br/>to B modulation we have to say that it is really (functionally?) Cb<br/>major, renotated for convenience.</p><p>&gt; C-E-G to C#-E#-G# is rare<br/>&gt; in classical music for at least two reasons:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) The progression takes place in chromatic space, so it will tend to<br/>&gt; occur most frequently when composers are thinking about the chromatic<br/>&gt; scale as a primary object, rather than the diatonic. This starts to<br/>&gt; occur frequently in the mid-nineteenth century.</p><p>I think tonality makes more sense as primary object here. If the<br/>chromatic scale is primary then what sense can you make out of<br/>modulation or harmonic distance? Actually what you have is not a<br/>binary opposition &apos;this note is / is not in the scale&apos; (which is<br/>harmonic distance), rather a hierarchy, in which each note of the<br/>chromatic scale is allowed but has a different function and degree of<br/>&apos;strangeness&apos; in the tonality. So harmonic distance may be defined via<br/>tonality and chord progressions, without reference to precisely<br/>defined scales. Every note can occur in every tonality, it just has a<br/>different relation to the tonal centre.</p><p>When Mozart writes F# E# F# E# F# in D major (K387) it is not making<br/>the chromatic scale a primary object, nor using a scale or tonality of<br/>F# minor, but simply decorating F# with a bit of foreign colour.</p><p>Going from isolated strange tones to entire strange chords, if writing<br/>in E major we could use the chord of C major without preparation (cf<br/>Haydn op.54 in C, Brahms sextet in G), despite its &apos;distance&apos; (...<br/>back with Schubertian third progressions, except as local colour<br/>rather than structure).</p><p>&gt; &gt;Suppig&apos;s Labyrinthus Musicus of 1722 (...)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;B-D-F-Ab to B-D-F-G#<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;which is the minimal distance between two chords in 31EDO!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, that is extremely cool!  Is there a recording/score available?</p><p>The piece is published in facsimile by Diapason Press<br/><a href="http://diapason.xentonic.org/ttl/">http://diapason.xentonic.org/ttl/</a><br/>although their manner of doing business is shrouded in perpetual<br/>mystery. I borrowed a copy from Andreas Sparschuh.</p><p>There will never be a recording because the piece is long and of poor<br/>musical quality, notable only for its microtonality. Now if you go to<br/>19EDO the same progression is also minimal I think.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div>
