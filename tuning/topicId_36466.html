Well, I was not referring to an overall strategy of<br/>adaptive JI in the sense you illustrate above. With no idea of the<br/>specifics of this piece, I was just guessing in a general way about<br/>possibilities. Without the Vicento meantone strategy, the fudging<br/>that takes place would not have to conform to the distributed comma<br/>solution implicit in meantone.</p><p>I do, however, like the overall strategy from your other post on this<br/>about using Pythagorean melody as an ideal in the lead voice (not<br/>always necessarily soprano) and adapting the other voices to<br/>harmonize justly with it. I actually tend to use a similar strategy<br/>with 12-tone ET rather than Pythagorean, since such keyboards abound<br/>everywhere and are the only practical reference in many situations.<br/>It just tends to turn out that way in the musical ecosystem we<br/>inhabit.</p><p>Actually 12-tET (11th-comma meantone) is quite handy for this<br/>purpose, and not melodically so maladapted to it.

Your English is quite clear, Michael. In practical adaptive JI,<br/>my approach is to simply allow the singers to intuitively adjust.<br/>They are most often not even aware of the fudging they&apos;re doing to<br/>avoid comma drift. There are three fundamental aspects to my approach.</p><p>1) Train or use singers trained to accurately hear just harmonies so<br/>they spontaneously tend to tune vertically for absolute purity.</p><p>2) Set the goal of not migrating the pitch. I use a standard 12-EDO<br/>electronic keyboard to check pitch. Timbre selection is important, so<br/>you might want to experiment. I use a lighter organ timbre with<br/>moderate harmonic content.</p><p>3) Let the necessary fudging take place intuitively. No need to talk<br/>about it except to establish the goal, nor should you attempt to<br/>implement predefined tuning strategies. This is beyond almost<br/>everyone&apos;s capability. Good luck if you attempt it, because you will<br/>definitely need a lot of that!</p><p>What happens when there are common tones as in your situation that<br/>would seem to &quot;lock in&quot; some comma drift? The singers, again usually<br/>unconsciously, fudge even while singing the same pitch. For<br/>example,if you use a standard 12-EDO electronic keyboard and tune a<br/>pure vocal G between octave Cs, then move the keyboard notes inward<br/>to Eb and Bb, a pitch-sensitive singer will retune the G down by<br/>about 18 cents to make the Eb major triad just.</p><p>The voice can execute this &quot;fudging&quot; much more subtly than a fixed<br/>pitch instrument, moving stealthily down in a short enough time to<br/>avoid creating an unpleasantly long tuning dissonance, but long<br/>enough to eliminate the aural &quot;shock&quot; of a sudden shift down by 18<br/>cents. A move of 18 cents on a keyboard in one discrete quantum leap<br/>is disturbing, but the voice can do this with little to no disturbing<br/>effect to anyone except the most exquisitely sensitive, fastidiously<br/>addicted microtonalists (the &quot;Princess and the Pea&quot; types).</p><p>We are all accustomed to continuously making subtle pitch adjustments<br/>of this order of magnitude or greater in non-fixed pitch instruments<br/>and/or vocal parts. These adjustments must occur if we are to react<br/>to our corrective aural feedback. Only fixed tunings do not use such<br/>adjustments as a normal part of performance practice.</p><p>A series of such adjustments made intuitively by singers who<br/>themselves are hardly aware of them should not prove disturbing to<br/>anyone else either. If there are vocal ensembles in the world who<br/>nail JI pitches spot on with no adjustments of this size or greater,<br/>please let me know, but I&apos;ve never heard them. I would tend to regard<br/>that as a pipe dream. On the other hand, although rare enough, there<br/>are ensembles that sing beautifully in adaptive JI and do not drift<br/>over the longer haul even through highly chromatic passages.</p><p>Hope this helps, Michael!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3><a id=36556 href="#36556">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2002 4:28:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;rwendell@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; so it seems to me that the need to eliminate comma drift, taken<br/>&gt; &gt; alone, does not lead to diatonic semitones narrower than 16/15<br/>&gt; (111.7<br/>&gt; &gt; cents), let alone ones near 25/24 (70.7 cents), and therefore<br/>&gt; &gt; cannot &apos;conveniently coincide&apos; with the strictly melodic desire<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; narrow diatonic semitones.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; what am i missing?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob:<br/>&gt; Hi, Paul!

Real human<br/>voices don&apos;t have this problem, so although potentially the computer-<br/>based optimizations are &quot;completely flexibly-pitched&quot;, the algorithms<br/>may not realize this potential appropriately. My statement was<br/>intended to refer precisely and only to what your following<br/>observation states:</p><p>&gt; &quot;my ear barked whenever i<br/>&gt; heard 20-cent shifts in the bach, and even 11 cent shifts left me<br/>&gt; squirming. i guess real human voices attached to real musical sense<br/>&gt; can smooth over such shifts a lot better than a computer-retuned<br/>&gt; midi file.&quot;</p><p>That was exactly my point and was the only point intended.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p><p>P.S. In light of our recent posts on 217-EDO, a viable computerized<br/>approach might be to use this ET as a convenient and even more<br/>flexible modern substitute for Vicento&apos;s strategy and then use<br/>algorithms that smoothly spread even these 5.5-cent shifts over a few<br/>milliseconds.</p><p>Such shifts, as I&apos;ve pointed out in a previous post, are perpetually<br/>occurring in flexibly-pitched performances and are totally acceptable<br/>to even the most demanding ears in my experience. If there are ears<br/>that refuse to accept them, they are ears that live in perpetual<br/>musical hell in our current musical environment.</p></div><h3><a id=36628 href="#36628">ðŸ”—</a>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2002 6:19:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>anyone out there? all three incarnations of this list are silent . . .</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;rwendell@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; P.S.
