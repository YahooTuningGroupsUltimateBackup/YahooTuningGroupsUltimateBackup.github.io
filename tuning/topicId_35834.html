You said that communication is sometimes difficult in these<br/>matters. How about garbled. Hold on and let me figure out what you&apos;re<br/>talking about here.</p><p>What is an &quot;actual&quot; third? Since I consider the physical (actual?) third to<br/>*be* the JI third, it hardly can be &quot;between&quot; it&apos;s self. I know what the JI<br/>position is and what the high position (both illusionary and vocally<br/>reproduced) is. I also consider the illusionary and vocally produced high<br/>thirds to be perceptually the same. There is nothing &quot;between&quot; these two<br/>&quot;positions,&quot; so far as I know.</p><p>My god, if your paragraph indicates what you think I have been saying, we<br/>have a pretty big gap to close. Let&apos;s define terms:</p><p>JI third - 4:5 relation to sounding root. Perceptually compares to ET third<br/>as being somewhat lower, which of course is expected.</p><p>Illusionary JI third - psycho-acoustic phenomenon that occurs (to some of<br/>us) when the 4:5 third is sounded with both the root and a 2:3 fifth.<br/>Perceptually compares to ET third as being somewhat higher, which is (as we<br/>well know) surprising to some and unbelievabe to others.</p><p>Vocally-produced JI third - one that is sung at the 4:5 position above a<br/>sounding root. It is easily perceived to be below ET. When sung within a<br/>well-tuned triad, it likely can be heard as the illusionary JI third.</p><p>Vocally-produced high third - sung at a frequency that appears to match (to<br/>some of us) the illusionary JI third, and is (to all of us) higher than ET.</p><p>So, we have two positions of the major third here, one lower than ET and the<br/>other higher than ET. Both can be vocally reproduced, sometime unknowingly<br/>and sometimes intentionally.</p><p>             *PERCIEVED THIRDS*        /   *SUNG THIRDS (learned)*<br/>         &quot;high&quot; JI third within triad  /   high third w/ or w/o 5th<br/>ET third ----------------------------------------------------------<br/>           JI third with root only     /    JI third w/ or w/o 5th</p><p>How&apos;s that?

Not clear?</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=35840 href="#35840">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2002 1:05:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On 3/20/02 8:02 PM, &quot;tuning@y...&quot; &lt;tuning@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Message: 22<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  Date: Tue, 19 Mar 2002 20:51:09 -0000<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  From: &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Digest Number 1971<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The last part I understand, but what does that have to do with<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you seem to be suggesting that a ji third leads to a perception<br/>&gt; &gt; of a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; high third, but that a slightly higher third would lead to a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; perception of a third *lower* than the high third. right?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; First phrase: yes.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Second phrase: huh?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;re saying that if the actual third is *between* the ji<br/>position<br/>&gt; &gt; and the &apos;high&apos; position, the perceived third will be *lower* than<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; perceived third from either a *true* ji third or a *true* high<br/>third.<br/>&gt; &gt; right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Holy cow, Paul.
