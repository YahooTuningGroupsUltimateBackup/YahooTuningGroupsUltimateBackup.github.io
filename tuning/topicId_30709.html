I don&apos;t really care if D is on it&apos;s &quot;real&quot; pitch.  I<br/>know D is an important note in this scale, but I would much rather<br/>have D on a Halberstadt Eb and have middle C where it is customarily.</p><p>You&apos;ll have to canvass the others... but that&apos;s how I feel at this<br/>very moment...</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
