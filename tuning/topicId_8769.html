My point here is only that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; string players are not as likely to be influenced by keyboards as are &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; singers.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; That&apos;s _all. The question of the &quot;high third&quot; is irrelevant here (as far as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I know).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Needless to say, I disagree,</p><p>Needless to say???????? What does that mean? That you will disagree no<br/>matter what I say? My point is that SINGERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE INFLUENCED<br/>BY KEYBOARDS BECAUSE THEY LEARN THEIR &quot;NOTES&quot; BY BANGING THEM OUT ON A<br/>KEYBOARD WHILE STRING PLAYERS DO NOT. What the h--l does the high third have<br/>to do with that?</p><p>&gt; and you<br/>&gt; can read the letters and comments of European musicians showing that in the<br/>&gt; 1720s, any sort of &quot;high third&quot; (especially one larger than 400&#xFFFD;) was heard<br/>&gt; as quite abhorrent, while by the 1750s, due to the influence of the new<br/>&gt; temperaments coming on the scene, such thirds were becoming more and more<br/>&gt; acceptable.</p><p>Okay, Paul. Then explain why my uninitiated simple and unbiased students<br/>sing a third that is higher than a 12-tET third when they have no reason to<br/>do so. Are they are simply stupid? If so, they are _all stupid. Don&apos;t give<br/>me the &quot;because they have been listening to 12-tET all their lives&quot; cr-p. It<br/>just doesn&apos;t wash.</p><p>I suggest you ask yourself what it is in my observations that appears to<br/>threaten an assumed &quot;Truth&quot; you have espoused. Paul, I have come to admire<br/>your extensive knowledge of historical writings. Please don&apos;t blow it by<br/>contributing illogical and irrelevant posts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Paul, I think your reasoning here is a bit suspect. If my hundreds of<br/>&gt;&gt;students were relying on a memory of 12-tET, why do they tune the third<br/>&gt;&gt;below piano pitch before the fifth is sounded, and why do they consistently<br/>&gt;&gt;move it above piano pitch while the fifth is sounding? Granted my &quot;demo&quot; had<br/>&gt;&gt;problems, but it did show a narrower third (albeit nearly at the piano pitch<br/>&gt;&gt;because of the basses sharp root) near the beginning of the example and a<br/>&gt;&gt;larger third near the end. To my ear, neither of these thirds were 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you know, I do believe the 4:5 &quot;low third&quot; is a powerful acoustical<br/>&gt; magnet that any sensitive singers would be drawn toward. I&apos;m not sure that<br/>&gt; the third at the end was larger than a 12-tET third -- yes, the upper note<br/>&gt; was higher than the piano pitch, but I think the bass was higher than the<br/>&gt; corresponding piano pitch by an even larger amount, with all these<br/>&gt; deviations being unstable, uncertain, and particularly confused by the<br/>&gt; addition of the poorly intonated fifth and the distracting piano tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I certainly don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; hear an acoustical &quot;locking&quot; occuring at two distinct values for the major<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; third in this example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Do you mean you don&apos;t hear _any locking? Or do you mean the &quot;two&quot; thirds are<br/>&gt;&gt;not different? As you would know, your answer to these questions is<br/>&gt;&gt;important. If the two thirds sound the same to you, it means we are hearing<br/>&gt;&gt;differently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I really don&apos;t hear is a major third that locks initially, expands<br/>&gt; through an unstable range, and finally locks again at a different, yet<br/>&gt; stable, value.</p><p>I thought you said that the initial third was likely 2:5. Are you changing<br/>that perception now?</p><p>&gt; If this phenomenon does in fact occur with better singers, I<br/>&gt; gave you my possible explanation (involving 1/24:1/19:1/16) some time ago.<br/>&gt; Certainly there are no simpler numbers that would be compatible with the<br/>&gt; phenomenon, given your reaction to the chords with sharper major thirds in<br/>&gt; Joe Monzo&apos;s file. Numbers like 19 are so high, though, that I feel that even<br/>&gt; if this explanation is correct, it is an artifact of trying to achieve an<br/>&gt; approximation of 12-tET through acoustical means.</p><p>Huh?</p><p>&gt; Here is a complete list of ratios using numbers up to 50 that represent<br/>&gt; intervals between 5:4 and 14:11 (which you though was too high to be the<br/>&gt; high third):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   386.3137&#xFFFD;    5:4<br/>&gt;   395.1692&#xFFFD;   49:39<br/>&gt;   396.1783&#xFFFD;   44:35<br/>&gt;   397.4471&#xFFFD;   39:31<br/>&gt;   399.0904&#xFFFD;   34:27<br/>&gt;   401.3028&#xFFFD;   29:23<br/>&gt;   404.4420&#xFFFD;   24:19<br/>&gt;   406.5623&#xFFFD;   43:34<br/>&gt;   409.2443&#xFFFD;   19:15<br/>&gt;   412.7453&#xFFFD;   33:26<br/>&gt;   414.1626&#xFFFD;   47:37<br/>&gt;   417.5080&#xFFFD;   14:11</p><p>Am I supposed to chose one?????<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Tonal music, in general, seems universal and probably predates God (at least<br/>&gt;&gt;man&apos;s concept of him/her). At the change of the millennium, polyphony was<br/>&gt;&gt;introduced in Western music, however it was still largely vocal,<br/>&gt;&gt;particularly in the altus and superius voices, each tuning to the sustained<br/>&gt;&gt;tenor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At that time, and for several centuries thereafter, there were no consonant<br/>&gt; triads,</p><p>What about consonant fifths and fourths? How were those determined? By<br/>playing them on an instrument?</p><p>&gt; no hint of major and minor modes, hence none of the elements that<br/>&gt; constitute &quot;tonal music&quot; in the sense it has in the title of Forte&apos;s book,<br/>&gt; and the sense that is relevant to our discussions here, all of which are<br/>&gt; framed in the context of this particular tonal system.</p><p>I agree. My point was that the century and a half that followed the middle<br/>ages was still largely vocal. Did you understand that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for universality, I suggest a bit of ethnomusicology for you. A recent<br/>&gt; PBS special would have been great. No hint of Western scales or tunings, let<br/>&gt; alone &quot;tonal music&quot;, in most of these cultures.</p><p>Perhaps you are confusing &quot;tonal music&quot; with &quot;functional harmony.&quot; The term<br/>&quot;tonal&quot; simply means that the pitches used in a particular system are<br/>defined in relation to a central pitch. Which ethnic musical cultures are<br/>_not based on this concept?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I didn&apos;t mean that I think historical musicians were unaware of tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;issues. I simply think that there would have been many, like many musicians<br/>&gt;&gt;today, who understood the theory and then did what they &quot;heard.&quot; I have<br/>&gt;&gt;observed, in many arenas of life, that what people _think they do is not<br/>&gt;&gt;always _what they do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I was talking about was musicians who were using their ears, their<br/>&gt; knowledge of what the music that _they_ made sounded like, apart from any<br/>&gt; theory. Their own reactions to various tunings were as valid to them as your<br/>&gt; reactions are to you. Like you, they made music in the way that sounded most<br/>&gt; natural to them, and heard various proposed tunings relative to that. What<br/>&gt; is fascinating is the conviction with which one set of norms felt &quot;natural&quot;<br/>&gt; to a set of musicians in one period, a different set of norms being<br/>&gt; &quot;natural&quot; in another period, and occasionally the _same_ musician will<br/>&gt; express a _different_ opinion of what sounds best early vs. late in their<br/>&gt; life (if they lived in a transitional period).</p><p>No problem here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Before continuing to dismiss the importance of keyboards,</p><p>I have no lack of appreciation for keyboards. I just think they can&apos;t &quot;hack<br/>it&quot; the way ears do.</p><p>&gt; read Daniel Wolf&apos;s<br/>&gt; recent post and Margo Schulter&apos;s upcoming one. But there is one important<br/>&gt; point you may be missing. Whether keyboards were present or not, the _music_<br/>&gt; is what was changing. The very style of the music went hand in hand with the<br/>&gt; tuning used. What musicians were feeling in the eighteenth century (and at<br/>&gt; many other points in time) was not simply a brainwashing due to abstract<br/>&gt; mathematical theories of how keyboards should be tuned. It was a revolution<br/>&gt; in musical expression, an &quot;out with the old and in with the new&quot; kind of<br/>&gt; mentality in which a collective cultural shift was being sensed and<br/>&gt; participated in by a generation of musicians. As keyboards were the primary<br/>&gt; tool with which composers brought these changes about, yes, we did get stuck<br/>&gt; with some tuning ideas a bit biased toward a fixed-pitch paradigm. But<br/>&gt; without the keyboard, the aesthetic movement may never have found as full a<br/>&gt; means of being realized.</p><p>This seems unlikely to me, but I&apos;ll keep an open mind on it.</p><p>&gt; The _mutually interacting_ and synergistic<br/>&gt; influences of the changes in keyboard tuning and the changes in musical<br/>&gt; style were strong enough to alter musicians&apos; _aural_ conception of what was<br/>&gt; natural and what wasn&apos;t.</p><p>After my experience with the flexible tuning, as exhibited in my recent mp3<br/>posts, I can never believe that any fixed keyboard tuning is anything but a<br/>compromise. To be sure, styles changed throughout music history. But I have<br/>a hard time supposing that the perceptual mechanics of ears changed much<br/>from one period to another. As I said, I will believe what someone _does<br/>more than what someone _says; and unfortunately we can&apos;t go back and give a<br/>listen. (Opinion subject to change after reading your cited sources. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I&apos;ll go back to your reaction to the I-IV-V7-I files.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;The mystery is why did six out of his eight<br/>&gt;&gt;files open nicely in QuickTime, while the two others only opened a blank IE<br/>&gt;&gt;window that would not go anywhere. The techie did not know about the IE<br/>&gt;&gt;browser reaction, but I didn&apos;t think it was worth the time to wait another<br/>&gt;&gt;hour and a half to find out what Microsoft had to say about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do hope you&apos;re able to listen to all eight files soon. Perhaps at someone<br/>&gt; else&apos;s PC?</p><p>Your suggestion was just in time. I pulled the &quot;rejects&quot; out of the trash<br/>and will take them to school tomorrow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, I&apos;ll now give you the lowdown on the files you listened to.</p><p>Good. I&apos;m curious.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;1. keenan. mid - harmless and familiar, a nice even control of dissonance<br/>&gt;&gt;but not &quot;in tune.&quot; The thirds are all a bit low<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The thirds are all exactly 5:4 above the roots.</p><p>I guess that&apos;s why I thought they were a bit low. I&apos;ve been &quot;culturized.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;and the roots in IV (I<br/>&gt;&gt;think) and V are flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The root of the IV chord is 488.9&#xFFFD; above the tonic, but the root of the V<br/>&gt; chord is 711.1&#xFFFD; above the tonic, hence the root of the V would probably be<br/>&gt; considered sharp, not flat.</p><p>Apparently I should have put the &quot;I think&quot; after the V.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;2. 71-64-81.mid - I and IV generally agreeable, V7 like a french accordian.<br/>&gt;&gt;(That means: @^*#_*^%$)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The V7 chord here has a low seventh (969&#xFFFD;=7:4) and a high third<br/>&gt; (408&#xFFFD;=Pythagorean). Evidently this does not satisfy you as the dominant<br/>&gt; chord with high third and low seventh.</p><p>Fer sure (to quote my Encino charges).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;3. 7I.mid - fantastic, lovely, wonderful, A+, ideal, real nice. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;:-)&quot; indicates that you might be joking,</p><p>You like Joe Pehrson was regarding my &quot;demo&quot;? No, I wasn&apos;t joking. I really<br/>liked it--&quot;low&quot; thirds and all.</p><p>&gt; but assuming you&apos;re not, this<br/>&gt; is the version that has pure 4:5:6 triads, 4:5:6:7 dominant seventh, and the<br/>&gt; roots related by perfect 2:3 or 3:4 ratios. Evidently the large shift in the<br/>&gt; tuning of the fourth scale degree does not bother you the way it _really_<br/>&gt; bothers me and some of the other people who have commented on this file. So<br/>&gt; unless you&apos;re joking, it appears that your theory is to some extent<br/>&gt; consistent with what you really like to hear.</p><p>This was the smoothest of the lot. Perhaps you and the &quot;other people&quot; have<br/>been &quot;culturized&quot; toward 12-tET to the extent that a raw 4:7 seventh sounds<br/>&quot;out of tune.&quot; To me it sounds exactly &quot;right.&quot; Yes, the &quot;large&quot; shift in<br/>the tuning of scale step four when it appears in the IV and V chords results<br/>&quot;naturally&quot; when singers seek optimum tuning. I wish there were a chance of<br/>adding this &quot;alternate&quot; scale step to our &quot;system,&quot; but alas I know that is<br/>not going to happen. Nevertheless, it doesn&apos;t prevent me from making my<br/>students aware of it. At very least, it explains why scale step 4 sounds so<br/>different when heard in these two harmonic contexts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;4. 51-5-9.mid - a decent I and IV, the root (I think, or is it the seventh)<br/>&gt;&gt;obnoxiously sharp in the V7.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s the seventh, which is 5:9 = 1018&#xFFFD; above the root.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;5. pythag.mid - a flat third in both the I and IV, and a ridiculous V7<br/>&gt;&gt;chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The I and IV are pure 4:5:6 triads, and the V7 (and only the V7) is in<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning, with a 408&#xFFFD; major third and a 996&#xFFFD; minor seventh.</p><p>At least I&apos;m somewhat consistent regarding my thirds. The Pythagorean tuning<br/>here tends to verify my contention that it is quite &quot;unhooked&quot; from the real<br/>world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;6. 1-4c-mt.mid - reasonable I and IV, a very flat leading tone in V7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma meantone. Here the thirds are exactly 5:4 over the roots, but the<br/>&gt; fifths are about 697&#xFFFD;. The roots are related by these flat fifths (sharp<br/>&gt; fourths), which (combined with the 5:4 thirds) is why the leading tone<br/>&gt; sounds so flat (major seventh = 386 + 697 = 1083&#xFFFD;) relative to what you&apos;re<br/>&gt; used to. The dominant seventh here has a seventh that is 1007&#xFFFD; above the<br/>&gt; root -- surprisingly, no one seems to have been bothered by this.</p><p>Yes, quite surprising. I didn&apos;t notice the seventh being a problem (perhaps<br/>because I was distracted by the flat leading tone?).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now I&apos;m _really_ curious as to how you would react to the other two files.<br/>&gt; So far, it&apos;s interesting how the 5:4 major thirds please you in some<br/>&gt; contexts but not in others.</p><p>Since you&apos;re curious, I will do my best to accommodate you. Yes, it is<br/>interesting about the various reactions to the thirds. Maybe we&apos;re on to<br/>something here.</p><p>Paul, I really appreciate your tranlating my reactions into tuning-ese. What<br/>you did rather quickly (I presume) would have taken me considerable time.<br/>I&apos;m very grateful.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=8775 href="#8775">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>2/23/2000 3:44:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:200002230702.XAA09785@snipe.prod.itd.earthlink.net">200002230702.XAA09785@snipe.prod.itd.earthlink.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay, Paul. Then explain why my uninitiated simple and unbiased students<br/>&gt; sing a third that is higher than a 12-tET third when they have no<br/>&gt; reason to<br/>&gt; do so. Are they are simply stupid? If so, they are _all stupid. Don&apos;t<br/>&gt; give<br/>&gt; me the &quot;because they have been listening to 12-tET all their lives&quot;<br/>&gt; cr-p. It<br/>&gt; just doesn&apos;t wash.</p><p>Well, forgive me for intruding on a private argument, but there are a<br/>number of reasons why either could be the case.</p><p>Say they&apos;re happily singing a pure major third, and then a fifth comes in.<br/> They think &quot;hey, this isn&apos;t what a major chord usually sounds like&quot;.  So,<br/>they raise the third, and it sounds more the thing.  Because this high<br/>third seems to work, they over-compensate a bit so that it gets even<br/>higher than Equal Temperament.  As the human ear is more sensitive to<br/>flatness than sharpness, this will not be such a critical error.</p><p>Or maybe they start out with pure thirds, and after practicing a few times<br/>discover that they have to sing sharp to produce a &quot;real&quot; major chord.<br/>After a while longer, they come to know where the Equal Tempered third<br/>should be, but still remember that they should be singing sharp, and so<br/>again over-compensate.</p><p>As for them all being stupid, well, stupid or not, it only takes one<br/>person to confidently sing a high third, and the rest will find they can<br/>lock in with that.</p><p>Now have a look at the list Paul gave you:</p><p>&gt;   386.3137&#xFFFD;    5:4<br/>&gt;   395.1692&#xFFFD;   49:39<br/>&gt;   396.1783&#xFFFD;   44:35<br/>&gt;   397.4471&#xFFFD;   39:31<br/>&gt;   399.0904&#xFFFD;   34:27<br/>&gt;   401.3028&#xFFFD;   29:23<br/>&gt;   404.4420&#xFFFD;   24:19<br/>&gt;   406.5623&#xFFFD;   43:34<br/>&gt;   409.2443&#xFFFD;   19:15<br/>&gt;   412.7453&#xFFFD;   33:26<br/>&gt;   414.1626&#xFFFD;   47:37<br/>&gt;   417.5080&#xFFFD;   14:11</p><p>If the chord &quot;locks&quot; it probably means an interval from this list is being<br/>chosen.  The small-integer theory is quite good for explaining harmonic<br/>phenomena, especially locking.  If you&apos;re singing a major third, and you<br/>expect it to be around 400 cents, and decide a 5:4 is too low, the most<br/>likely intervals to lock into would be 24:19 or 19:15.  The only number<br/>put on the high third so far is 404 cents, which would suggest 24:19.<br/>That&apos;s interesting, as it would make a major triad the inversion of a<br/>16:19:24 minor triad.  Although 19:15 is simpler than 24:19, it is more<br/>complex relative to the 3:2, so is less likely.  Once they get used to<br/>high thirds, they may even reach 33:26 or 14:11.</p><p>So it&apos;s quite reasonable that singers enculturated with Equal Temperament<br/>will end up locking in to a high third at 404 cents.  As for why they<br/>alter pitch when the fifth comes in, well, bare major thirds are ugly in<br/>Equal Temperament.  You don&apos;t hear many of them, and the tendency will be<br/>to make them just.</p><p>To move this discussion onwards, try recording more examples, and measure<br/>the position and range of tolerance of this high third.  Also, it may be<br/>useful to know how it changes as the singers become more experienced.</p><p>You may try taking a fresh group of students, and soaking them in meantone<br/>of JI examples before they start singing.  See if it makes a difference.</p></div><h3><a id=8781 href="#8781">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Are you changing<br/>&gt;that perception now?</p><p>Not really. The initial third is a very fuzzy version of a 2:5 -- I wouldn&apos;t<br/>call it locking, but clearly it&apos;s highly influenced by the acoustical<br/>simplicity of the 2:5 ratio. The main point, though, is the rest of my<br/>sentence: &quot;What I really don&apos;t hear is a major third that . . . expands<br/>through an unstable range, and finally locks again at a different, yet<br/>stable, value.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&gt; If this phenomenon does in fact occur with better singers, I<br/>&gt;&gt; gave you my possible explanation (involving 1/24:1/19:1/16) some time<br/>ago.<br/>&gt;&gt; Certainly there are no simpler numbers that would be compatible with the<br/>&gt;&gt; phenomenon, given your reaction to the chords with sharper major thirds<br/>in<br/>&gt;&gt; Joe Monzo&apos;s file. Numbers like 19 are so high, though, that I feel that<br/>even<br/>&gt;&gt; if this explanation is correct, it is an artifact of trying to achieve an<br/>&gt;&gt; approximation of 12-tET through acoustical means.</p><p>&gt;Huh?</p><p>Which part is confusing?</p><p>&gt;&gt; Here is a complete list of ratios using numbers up to 50 that represent<br/>&gt;&gt; intervals between 5:4 and 14:11 (which you though was too high to be the<br/>&gt;&gt; high third):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   386.3137&#xFFFD;    5:4<br/>&gt;&gt;   395.1692&#xFFFD;   49:39<br/>&gt;&gt;   396.1783&#xFFFD;   44:35<br/>&gt;&gt;   397.4471&#xFFFD;   39:31<br/>&gt;&gt;   399.0904&#xFFFD;   34:27<br/>&gt;&gt;   401.3028&#xFFFD;   29:23<br/>&gt;&gt;   404.4420&#xFFFD;   24:19<br/>&gt;&gt;   406.5623&#xFFFD;   43:34<br/>&gt;&gt;   409.2443&#xFFFD;   19:15<br/>&gt;&gt;   412.7453&#xFFFD;   33:26<br/>&gt;&gt;   414.1626&#xFFFD;   47:37<br/>&gt;&gt;   417.5080&#xFFFD;   14:11</p><p>&gt;Am I supposed to chose one?????</p><p>I just thought this might be interesting and relevant.</p><p>&gt;&gt; At that time, and for several centuries thereafter, there were no<br/>consonant<br/>&gt;&gt; triads,</p><p>&gt;What about consonant fifths and fourths? How were those determined? By<br/>&gt;playing them on an instrument?</p><p>As I said, I believe these intervals arose vocally. Most world scales<br/>feature some repetition at the fifth or fourth.</p><p>&gt;&gt; no hint of major and minor modes, hence none of the elements that<br/>&gt;&gt; constitute &quot;tonal music&quot; in the sense it has in the title of Forte&apos;s<br/>book,<br/>&gt;&gt; and the sense that is relevant to our discussions here, all of which are<br/>&gt;&gt; framed in the context of this particular tonal system.</p><p>&gt;I agree. My point was that the century and a half that followed the middle<br/>&gt;ages was still largely vocal. Did you understand that?</p><p>Yes, although the very notation used by composers had a very important<br/>shaping influence on what types of progressions could or could not be<br/>entertained. Ones that could included any that involved the 80:81 comma<br/>(such as what would later be called a I-vi-ii-V-I progression), ones that<br/>could not included, for example, ones that involved the 250:243 comma (such<br/>as Herman Miller&apos;s recent beautiful example).</p><p>&gt;&gt; As for universality, I suggest a bit of ethnomusicology for you. A recent<br/>&gt;&gt; PBS special would have been great. No hint of Western scales or tunings,<br/>let<br/>&gt;&gt; alone &quot;tonal music&quot;, in most of these cultures.</p><p>&gt;Perhaps you are confusing &quot;tonal music&quot; with &quot;functional harmony.&quot; The term<br/>&gt;&quot;tonal&quot; simply means that the pitches used in a particular system are<br/>&gt;defined in relation to a central pitch.</p><p>Look up five paragraphs in this message: I&apos;m talking about &quot;&apos;tonal music&apos; in<br/>the sense it has in the title of Forte&apos;s book, and the sense that is<br/>relevant to our discussions here, all of which are framed in the context of<br/>this particular tonal system.&quot; By &quot;our discussions here&quot; I mean I-IV-V7-I,<br/>etc.</p><p>&gt;After my experience with the flexible tuning, as exhibited in my recent mp3<br/>&gt;posts, I can never believe that any fixed keyboard tuning is anything but a<br/>&gt;compromise.</p><p>It&apos;s more than a compromise. At the very least, it makes certain singable<br/>progressions available to the composer, and others unavailable.</p><p>[your favorite was]<br/>&gt;&gt; the version that has pure 4:5:6 triads, 4:5:6:7 dominant seventh, and the<br/>&gt;&gt; roots related by perfect 2:3 or 3:4 ratios.</p><p>&gt;I wish there were a chance of<br/>&gt;adding this &quot;alternate&quot; scale step to our &quot;system,&quot; but alas I know that is<br/>&gt;not going to happen.</p><p>Why never? In 31-equal, for example, we can play this progression almost<br/>exactly as C-E-G F-A-C G-B-D-E# C-E-G. Perhaps when Monz gets back he can<br/>code this up and you can tell us how you like it. 31-equal has proved quite<br/>workable on keyboards (Fokker&apos;s organ) and guitars (Catler, etc.); it is<br/>only a matter of overcoming cultural inertia to make it more widespread.<br/>(OK, I&apos;m a dreamer, but all change is instigated by dreamers).</p><p>&gt;At least I&apos;m somewhat consistent regarding my thirds. The Pythagorean<br/>tuning<br/>&gt;here tends to verify my contention that it is quite &quot;unhooked&quot; from the<br/>real<br/>&gt;world.</p><p>Does the Pythagorean third (408&#xFFFD;) sound too high to be the &quot;high third&quot;? In<br/>Monz&apos; examples you placed it at the upper limit of the acceptable &quot;high<br/>third&quot; candidates. Perhaps with a seventh on top the &quot;high third&quot; is<br/>different that without it?</p><p>&gt;Paul, I really appreciate your tranlating my reactions into tuning-ese.<br/>What<br/>&gt;you did rather quickly (I presume) would have taken me considerable time.<br/>&gt;I&apos;m very grateful.</p><p>Jerry, I know you have a great ear and are a highly skilled musician within<br/>at least one style. It is therefore of great interest to me to understand<br/>tuning as it works for you, and to help put a quantitative underpinning to<br/>the things you hear.</p></div><h3><a id=8786 href="#8786">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Are they are simply stupid? If so, they are _all stupid. Don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; give<br/>&gt;&gt; me the &quot;because they have been listening to 12-tET all their lives&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; cr-p. It<br/>&gt;&gt; just doesn&apos;t wash.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, forgive me for intruding on a private argument, but there are a<br/>&gt; number of reasons why either could be the case.</p><p>No intrusion. Where have you been? This whole exchange would probably take a<br/>much more productive direction if more members would get involved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Say they&apos;re happily singing a pure major third, and then a fifth comes in.<br/>&gt;  They think &quot;hey, this isn&apos;t what a major chord usually sounds like&quot;.  So,<br/>&gt; they raise the third, and it sounds more the thing.  Because this high<br/>&gt; third seems to work, they over-compensate a bit so that it gets even<br/>&gt; higher than Equal Temperament.  As the human ear is more sensitive to<br/>&gt; flatness than sharpness,</p><p>Really? Tell me more. I don&apos;t know about this.</p><p>&gt; this will not be such a critical error.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or maybe they start out with pure thirds, and after practicing a few times<br/>&gt; discover that they have to sing sharp to produce a &quot;real&quot; major chord.<br/>&gt; After a while longer, they come to know where the Equal Tempered third<br/>&gt; should be, but still remember that they should be singing sharp, and so<br/>&gt; again over-compensate.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for them all being stupid, well, stupid or not, it only takes one<br/>&gt; person to confidently sing a high third, and the rest will find they can<br/>&gt; lock in with that.</p><p>Consider that the &quot;demo&quot; I described has been tested many dozens of times<br/>with groups of singers who never met the others. Are you suggesting that<br/>_every group had an overexuberant singer?

However, look<br/>at the size of those numbers. I don&apos;t _think_ so.</p><p>&gt; The small-integer theory is quite good for explaining harmonic<br/>&gt; phenomena, especially locking.  If you&apos;re singing a major third, and you<br/>&gt; expect it to be around 400 cents, and decide a 5:4 is too low, the most<br/>&gt; likely intervals to lock into would be 24:19 or 19:15.  The only number<br/>&gt; put on the high third so far is 404 cents, which would suggest 24:19.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s interesting, as it would make a major triad the inversion of a<br/>&gt; 16:19:24 minor triad.  Although 19:15 is simpler than 24:19, it is more<br/>&gt; complex relative to the 3:2, so is less likely.

So it&apos;s the out-of-tuneness that<br/>gives the tension, not the third-ness.  However, the remark went by<br/>without comment, so I took it to be generally agreed that bare thirds<br/>(which most know only in their Equal Tempered form) are essentially<br/>dissonances.  Maybe he did mean voices moving in parallel thirds, I dunno.</p><p>Anyway, my experience is that a bad third in a triad is less of a problem<br/>than a bad third on its own.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You don&apos;t hear many of them,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Huh?</p><p>Well, provide an example if you like.  Bare fifths are used a lot.  I went<br/>through a Slayer music book, and nearly every chord is an open fifth<br/>(that&apos;s the term, isn&apos;t it?).  The exception was one bare third in the<br/>whole album.  In normal music, thirds are hidden away inside chords.  The<br/>theory books may not say so, but musicians know which intervals are in<br/>tune.</p><p>&gt; &gt; and the tendency will be<br/>&gt; &gt; to make them just.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wish!!!</p><p>For a naive singer I&apos;m sure this would be the case.  Although I&apos;ve now<br/>heard enough meantone to be an atypical listener, I don&apos;t really recognise<br/>the sound of an isolated tempered major third.  I don&apos;t think anyone who<br/>hasn&apos;t been through ear training would hear such an interval as correct.<br/>Whereas the just third will stand out as a consonance maximum to anybody.<br/>Guitarists discover this through tuning by ear, and have to be told why<br/>they&apos;re wrong.</p><p>Now, if I were singing a major third, I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d get it<br/>accurately to say if it were a 5:4, 7:9 or even 9:11.

Or even tune<br/>a keyboard to JI, hit a major chord and say &quot;sing this&quot;.  Or -- now here&apos;s<br/>an idea -- play a JI chord on a string patch, and get them to sing along.<br/>Then remove notes one by one, and see if the third changes as the keyboard<br/>loses it.  Try the same thing with the meantone fifth.</p><p>&gt; Thanks for your ideas, .......Graham(?)</p><p>That&apos;s okay.  One other thing I was thinking about.  You were saying<br/>before about how Sheila Chandra sang a high E with a low F.  It&apos;s also an<br/>article of faith (with some experimental backing) that minor seconds in<br/>melody tend to be narrowed, whereas larger intervals tend to be widened.<br/>The whole subject of melodic intonation tends to be ignored relative to<br/>vertical harmony.  I think the reason is that harmony can be easily<br/>explained with reference to the harmonic series, but nobody really<br/>understands pure melody in terms of anything more fundamental.  So, if you<br/>think you have something to say about melody, the field&apos;s wide open.</p><p>But more specifically, the idea (which I agree with) that E# should be<br/>lower than F is entirely based on tuning to low-integer-ratio intervals.<br/>It has nothing to do with how scales will most likely be tuned<br/>melodically.  So you may find a melodic F appearing where a harmonic E#<br/>should be.  This is why I think it may be better to assume E# and F are<br/>the same pitch class, outside of an explicit meantone context.  If the<br/>harmonic and melodic rules lead to a different order of pitches, neither<br/>can be relied upon as a standard.</p><p>Another thread: the measured values for C, E and G in &quot;Can&apos;t Buy Me Love&quot;<br/>(see earlier in the month) are 262, 337 and 405 Hz.  That&apos;s consistent<br/>with the melodic intervals being stretched.  405/337, the measured minor<br/>third, is close to just, and so wider than ET.  A just major third would<br/>be narrower than ET, and so has to be stretched.  I wonder if the<br/>approximations to 9/7 and 6/5 are a coincidence.</p><p>To remove ambiguity, it&apos;s:</p><p>                Graham Breed<br/>         <a href="http://x31eq.com/">http://x31eq.com/</a></p></div><h3><a id=8802 href="#8802">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Swoger-Ruston &#x3C;pruston@yorku.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>2/24/2000 7:46:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, I&apos;m new to the list...hopefully I won&apos;t ask anything too moronic.</p><p>I&apos;m wondering if this issue of &apos;sharpness&apos; has any significance in two<br/>isolated situations.

I use different addresses depending on where I<br/>&gt;write from, and it looks like my name wasn&apos;t getting through this time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Actually, it appears that the address I sent from was over-written with my<br/>&gt;default OneList address, and my name removed in the process.  This hasn&apos;t<br/>&gt;happened before.  I wonder if the list processor has changed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; No intrusion. Where have you been? This whole exchange would probably<br/>&gt;&gt; take a<br/>&gt;&gt; much more productive direction if more members would get involved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, I don&apos;t have a good enough ear to know a high third when I hear it,<br/>&gt;and don&apos;t have experience of choral singing.  So there&apos;s not really much I<br/>&gt;can say, but it would be interesting if you could put numbers on this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; As the human ear is more sensitive to<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; flatness than sharpness,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Really? Tell me more. I don&apos;t know about this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I can&apos;t give a reference off hand, but physics of music books tend to<br/>&gt;cover this sort of thing.  It also agrees with anecdotal evidence: I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;heard more singers criticised for being flat than sharp.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Consider that the &quot;demo&quot; I described has been tested many dozens of<br/>&gt;&gt; times<br/>&gt;&gt; with groups of singers who never met the others. Are you suggesting that<br/>&gt;&gt; _every group had an overexuberant singer? I doubt that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No, but it&apos;s a possibility that the most confident singer will always be<br/>&gt;the one with the best memory of what the &quot;real&quot; chord should sound like.<br/>&gt;This could be tested: take randomly selected newbies, and get them to sing<br/>&gt;individually against a tape playing the root and fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; If the chord &quot;locks&quot; it probably means an interval from this list is<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; being<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; chosen.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That was my initial hope--to find such a simple explanation. However,<br/>&gt;&gt; look<br/>&gt;&gt; at the size of those numbers. I don&apos;t _think_ so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You mean the size of the cent-intervals or the size of the ratios?  I&apos;m<br/>&gt;open to the possibility that 24:19 could be perceived as such.  If you can<br/>&gt;show people consistently hitting this, it would be good proof.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; So it&apos;s quite reasonable that singers enculturated with Equal<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Temperament<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; will end up locking in to a high third at 404 cents.  As for why they<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; alter pitch when the fifth comes in, well, bare major thirds are ugly<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; in<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Equal Temperament.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Ugly? Well, maybe....depending on one&apos;s standard. However, remember that<br/>&gt;&gt; many if not most singers continually imitate ET thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I saw a post on Usenet recently where somebody said that parallel major<br/>&gt;thirds increase the tension.  I presume he meant bare thirds (parallel<br/>&gt;fifths mean something else in voice leading, but again I&apos;m no expert).<br/>&gt;That went against my experience, so I tried it, and it is the case --<br/>&gt;provided they&apos;re tuned to 12-equal.  So it&apos;s the out-of-tuneness that<br/>&gt;gives the tension, not the third-ness.  However, the remark went by<br/>&gt;without comment, so I took it to be generally agreed that bare thirds<br/>&gt;(which most know only in their Equal Tempered form) are essentially<br/>&gt;dissonances.  Maybe he did mean voices moving in parallel thirds, I dunno.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Anyway, my experience is that a bad third in a triad is less of a problem<br/>&gt;than a bad third on its own.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; You don&apos;t hear many of them,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Huh?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, provide an example if you like.  Bare fifths are used a lot.  I went<br/>&gt;through a Slayer music book, and nearly every chord is an open fifth<br/>&gt;(that&apos;s the term, isn&apos;t it?).  The exception was one bare third in the<br/>&gt;whole album.  In normal music, thirds are hidden away inside chords.  The<br/>&gt;theory books may not say so, but musicians know which intervals are in<br/>&gt;tune.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; and the tendency will be<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; to make them just.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I wish!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For a naive singer I&apos;m sure this would be the case.  Although I&apos;ve now<br/>&gt;heard enough meantone to be an atypical listener, I don&apos;t really recognise<br/>&gt;the sound of an isolated tempered major third.  I don&apos;t think anyone who<br/>&gt;hasn&apos;t been through ear training would hear such an interval as correct.<br/>&gt;Whereas the just third will stand out as a consonance maximum to anybody.<br/>&gt;Guitarists discover this through tuning by ear, and have to be told why<br/>&gt;they&apos;re wrong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now, if I were singing a major third, I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d get it<br/>&gt;accurately to say if it were a 5:4, 7:9 or even 9:11.  I should really try<br/>&gt;these things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; To move this discussion onwards, try recording more examples, and<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; measure<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; the position and range of tolerance of this high third.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; An excellent proposal. I need to acquire some means of measuring.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;If you can record the MP3s, people will be able to analyse them.  Can<br/>&gt;anybody recommend spectral analysis software for Windows (even Linux)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ideally, each voice would be multitracked and analyzed individually.  That<br/>&gt;should have been done a long time ago by somebody with a research grant,<br/>&gt;but to my knowledge hasn&apos;t been.  Experimental data on how instruments are<br/>&gt;tuned in real performances are surprisingly hard to come by.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Also, it may be<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; useful to know how it changes as the singers become more experienced.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In my observation, both beginners and amateurs tend to arrive at the<br/>&gt;&gt; same<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;lock&quot; on the high third, but then I could be mistaken. It would be<br/>&gt;&gt; good to<br/>&gt;&gt; know for sure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;And either way, it&apos;d be nice to see such things documented.  Music<br/>&gt;theory&apos;s in a bad way when it claims to be based on the major triad, but<br/>&gt;can&apos;t even say how average singers will render it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; You may try taking a fresh group of students, and soaking them in<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; meantone<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; of JI examples before they start singing.  See if it makes a<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; difference.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; A pretty wild idea. I think it would take considerable time to<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;reculturize&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; modern young people who are constantly drenched in MTV.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, try for half an hour and see if it makes a difference.  Or even tune<br/>&gt;a keyboard to JI, hit a major chord and say &quot;sing this&quot;.  Or -- now here&apos;s<br/>&gt;an idea -- play a JI chord on a string patch, and get them to sing along.<br/>&gt;Then remove notes one by one, and see if the third changes as the keyboard<br/>&gt;loses it.  Try the same thing with the meantone fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Thanks for your ideas, .......Graham(?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That&apos;s okay.  One other thing I was thinking about.  You were saying<br/>&gt;before about how Sheila Chandra sang a high E with a low F.  It&apos;s also an<br/>&gt;article of faith (with some experimental backing) that minor seconds in<br/>&gt;melody tend to be narrowed, whereas larger intervals tend to be widened.<br/>&gt;The whole subject of melodic intonation tends to be ignored relative to<br/>&gt;vertical harmony.  I think the reason is that harmony can be easily<br/>&gt;explained with reference to the harmonic series, but nobody really<br/>&gt;understands pure melody in terms of anything more fundamental.  So, if you<br/>&gt;think you have something to say about melody, the field&apos;s wide open.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;But more specifically, the idea (which I agree with) that E# should be<br/>&gt;lower than F is entirely based on tuning to low-integer-ratio intervals.<br/>&gt;It has nothing to do with how scales will most likely be tuned<br/>&gt;melodically.  So you may find a melodic F appearing where a harmonic E#<br/>&gt;should be.  This is why I think it may be better to assume E# and F are<br/>&gt;the same pitch class, outside of an explicit meantone context.  If the<br/>&gt;harmonic and melodic rules lead to a different order of pitches, neither<br/>&gt;can be relied upon as a standard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Another thread: the measured values for C, E and G in &quot;Can&apos;t Buy Me Love&quot;<br/>&gt;(see earlier in the month) are 262, 337 and 405 Hz.  That&apos;s consistent<br/>&gt;with the melodic intervals being stretched.  405/337, the measured minor<br/>&gt;third, is close to just, and so wider than ET.  A just major third would<br/>&gt;be narrower than ET, and so has to be stretched.  I wonder if the<br/>&gt;approximations to 9/7 and 6/5 are a coincidence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;To remove ambiguity, it&apos;s:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                Graham Breed<br/>&gt;         <a href="http://x31eq.com/">http://x31eq.com/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<a href="https://twitter.com/Backup">@Backup</a>-The Easiest Way to Protect and Access your files.<br/>&gt;Automatic backups and off-site storage of your critical data.

There was a small New York jazz scene (early 80&apos;s)<br/>&gt;where players were intentionally trying to play as sharp as possible, maybe<br/>&gt;to increase tension or a sense of &apos;outsideness&apos;.  As well, it seemed to me<br/>&gt;that a couple years back, alot of pop albums were coming out where the<br/>&gt;singers were singing sharp.

However, it<br/>seems to me that it would be helpful to all--including you and me--to narrow<br/>this discussion and refocus it to the essentials. With this in mind I&apos;ll try<br/>to combine our three separate exchanges into one, and drop the issues that<br/>are, in my mind, somewhat irrelevant. Needless to say, if I appear to ignore<br/>something that you feel is critical, please revive it.</p><p>Upon rereading some of my heated statements, I think these are partly<br/>symptomatic of my frustration in not finding much insight regarding my<br/>initial purpose for being here (although I have enjoyed the experience and<br/>have learned an enormous amount of valuable information). As I mentioned to<br/>some members off-List, I guess I had initially assumed that many here would<br/>have already experienced the &quot;high third&quot; phenomenon. It soon was clear that<br/>most of the members approach tuning from a historical/keyboard point of view<br/>and that this was not the case.</p><p>It was mentioned by some that much of this discussion has been conducted<br/>without the benefit of sound examples. That, too, was partly because I hoped<br/>that others would have already been familiar with the &quot;high third,&quot; simply<br/>because it appeared to me to be a &quot;natural&quot; phenomenon. I understand now why<br/>that would not likely be the case (except for singers like John Link, of<br/>course, and perhaps some others who have been silent). I apologize again for<br/>it taking me so long to learn to upload sound files. It wasn&apos;t that it was<br/>hard to do; it was simply a matter of finding the time.</p><p>I hope that my posting of excerpts last weekend was helpful in clarifying<br/>where I&apos;m coming from. Since I had to removed them from my site (do to being<br/>over my meg limit), I will be happy to email them directly to any folks who<br/>missed them but would like to hear them.</p><p>There is at least one more &quot;demo&quot; that we discussed earlier that might be<br/>helpful--that is, my own singing of preferred tunings against fixed pitches.<br/>I&apos;ll see what I can do about that next week.</p><p>So, here are my replies to what I consider to be the more important points<br/>that seem unresolved:</p><p>----------------</p><p>I rudely screamed:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;My point is that SINGERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE INFLUENCED<br/>&gt;&gt;BY KEYBOARDS BECAUSE THEY LEARN THEIR &quot;NOTES&quot; BY BANGING THEM OUT ON A<br/>&gt;&gt;KEYBOARD WHILE STRING PLAYERS DO NOT. What the h--l does the high third have<br/>&gt;&gt;to do with that?</p><p>And you, Paul, calmly and politely, ignored the point again:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because the high third does not seem to be explicable in terms of a simple<br/>&gt; acoustical agreement between the notes, and because musicians (string<br/>&gt; players included) were quite aware of their intonation in the 16th through<br/>&gt; early 18th centuries and shunned any kind of high third, and because their<br/>&gt; opinion on this issue changed dramatically later in the 18th century, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; forced to conclude that the high third is more a cultural (let&apos;s say<br/>&gt; &quot;musical&quot;) than acoustical phenomenon.</p><p>Does this avoidance of my simple statement mean that you _don&apos;t think that<br/>singers are more likely than string players to be influenced by keyboards?<br/>My concern here is not that I disagree with your paragraph, but that my<br/>statement is not concerned with anything other than the difference in the<br/>way singers and string player learn tuning. That&apos;s all.</p><p>While this point is not critical to our discussion of the &quot;high third,&quot; it<br/>may be helpful, I feel, to demonstrate to you that you have a tendency to<br/>read things into statements that are not intended by the writer.<br/>Apparently, your continued enthusiasm for driving home the point that<br/>historical practices have something to do with how flexible-pitch musicians<br/>tune, you didn&apos;t get the essential import of my statement. The context in<br/>which it was originally offered is no longer in my memory, so I&apos;ll be happy<br/>just to drop this one.</p><p>--------------</p><p>Regarding the high third, Paul said:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; If this phenomenon does in fact occur with better singers, I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; gave you my possible explanation (involving 1/24:1/19:1/16) some time ago.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Certainly there are no simpler numbers that would be compatible with the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; phenomenon, given your reaction to the chords with sharper major thirds in<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Joe Monzo&apos;s file. Numbers like 19 are so high, though, that I feel that even<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; if this explanation is correct, it is an artifact of trying to achieve an<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; approximation of 12-tET through acoustical means.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Huh?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which part is confusing?</p><p>Reading it at 1 in the afternoon is much better than reading it at 1 in the<br/>morning. :-) I not only understand it now, but I agree that the high numbers<br/>are not likely to represent the phenomenon. It was the last phrase that<br/>raised my eyebrow. If tuning-aware singers are in fact &quot;trying to achieve an<br/>approximation of 12-tET&quot; why do they seem to agree on a third _higher than<br/>the keyboard third? In any case, I think we can put to rest the notion that<br/>the &quot;high third&quot; phenomenon can be explained by any small-number ratio. For<br/>that progress, your efforts (and those of many others here) are appreciated.<br/>&gt;<br/>-------------</p><p>It had occurred to me to suggest:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Perhaps you are confusing &quot;tonal music&quot; with &quot;functional harmony.&quot; The term<br/>&gt;&gt;&quot;tonal&quot; simply means that the pitches used in a particular system are<br/>&gt;&gt;defined in relation to a central pitch.</p><p>Which you sidestepped by saying:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Look up five paragraphs in this message: I&apos;m talking about &quot;&apos;tonal music&apos; in<br/>&gt; the sense it has in the title of Forte&apos;s book, and the sense that is<br/>&gt; relevant to our discussions here, all of which are framed in the context of<br/>&gt; this particular tonal system.&quot; By &quot;our discussions here&quot; I mean I-IV-V7-I,<br/>&gt; etc.</p><p>Clearly you were not using the term as I had intended it.

At the very least, it makes certain singable<br/>&gt; progressions available to the composer, and others unavailable.</p><p>Begging your pardon, I think this response is another diversion. You must<br/>know by now that my singers are seeking &quot;best&quot; tuning for each important<br/>chord. No keyboard can do that. Your statement seems to be offered from the<br/>viewpoint of the keyboard. To be sure, meantone and 12t-tET have provided<br/>the means for keyboards to play in the main arena. But singers could _always<br/>seek the &quot;best&quot; tuning as I have described it. Whether they actually did, or<br/>were influenced by keyboards is another interesting matter for discussion.<br/>My point, to be clear, has to do with the quest for &quot;nature&apos;s&quot; intervals.<br/>Singers do it &quot;naturally&quot; (in my experience) while keyboards haven&apos;t a<br/>prayer as chords change in musical context.</p><p>Your phrase &quot;makes certain singable progressions available&quot; is significant.<br/>Adapting keyboard tuning makes those progressions available to the<br/>_keyboard, not to tuning-sensitive singers (who can tune just about anything<br/>to a reasonable &quot;lock.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; [your favorite was]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the version that has pure 4:5:6 triads, 4:5:6:7 dominant seventh, and the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; roots related by perfect 2:3 or 3:4 ratios.</p><p>I rest my case. (Skip the &quot;high third&quot; in this discussion. JI is basic.)</p><p>-------------</p><p>I said:</p><p>&gt;&gt;At least I&apos;m somewhat consistent regarding my thirds. The Pythagorean tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;here tends to verify my contention that it is quite &quot;unhooked&quot; from the real<br/>&gt;&gt;world.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does the Pythagorean third (408&#xFFFD;) sound too high to be the &quot;high third&quot;? In<br/>&gt; Monz&apos; examples you placed it at the upper limit of the acceptable &quot;high<br/>&gt; third&quot; candidates. Perhaps with a seventh on top the &quot;high third&quot; is<br/>&gt; different that without it?</p><p>I haven&apos;t experimented with the &quot;action&quot; of the third with the well-tuned<br/>seventh sounding. Perhaps I&apos;ll give it a go next week.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Paul, I really appreciate your tranlating my reactions into tuning-ese. What<br/>&gt;&gt;you did rather quickly (I presume) would have taken me considerable time.<br/>&gt;&gt;I&apos;m very grateful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry, I know you have a great ear and are a highly skilled musician within<br/>&gt; at least one style. It is therefore of great interest to me to understand<br/>&gt; tuning as it works for you, and to help put a quantitative underpinning to<br/>&gt; the things you hear.</p><p>I appreciate your continued interest in this research.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Paul said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The only basic pitch relations that I&apos;m willing to believe can be perceived<br/>&gt; regardless of period or geographical style are the very simplest ratios --</p><p>That has been my basic assumption, and continues to be.</p><p>&gt; musical style then leads to combinations (of these ratios) of<br/>&gt; ever-increasing complexity and intonational mutability. Why would I believe<br/>&gt; anything else? There&apos;s no evidence, and Occam&apos;s razor (combined with my<br/>&gt; knowledge of psychoacoustics) speaks against introducing other intervals<br/>&gt; (like the high third) into the palette of universally perceived pitch<br/>&gt; relations.</p><p>Yeah! I know! I would drop the subject in an LA minute except that I have<br/>witnessed overwhelming evidence that something is going on here. Believe me,<br/>it would simplify my life to find out it is an illusion.</p><p>---------------------------</p><p>I said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;My hope is that you understand what I have<br/>&gt;&gt;described. I&apos;m not sure you do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I do (please correct me if I&apos;m wrong), and I&apos;ve been trying to help<br/>&gt; understand how this &quot;high third&quot; phenomenon might arise. It clearly isn&apos;t a<br/>&gt; matter of &quot;all music is made up of the simplest acoustical phenomena =<br/>&gt; simplest ratios&quot; since there are myriad ratios simpler than any of the &quot;high<br/>&gt; third&quot; candidates but which are clearly not used in Western music.</p><p>Right.

That&apos;s all.</p><p>I think that the way both string players and singers learn tuning is a far<br/>more complex issue than simply the degree to which they are directly<br/>influenced by keyboards.

The point I was trying to make with<br/>the Arabic bit was that each culture establishes its own norms for<br/>intonation and it is through cultural experience that a feeling of<br/>certainty, or &quot;naturalness&quot; if you will, is attained by musicians. The fact<br/>is that today, the third of a pure 4:5:6 sounds &quot;flat&quot; to most musicians (it<br/>even did to you in some of the examples). To me, that (combined with the<br/>best historical documentation we have) is evidence that tastes have changed<br/>and tuning is not simply a matter of acoustical or physiological<br/>&quot;universals&quot;.</p><p>&gt;Apparently, your continued enthusiasm for driving home the point that<br/>&gt;historical practices have something to do with how flexible-pitch musicians<br/>&gt;tune</p><p>Fixed-pitch musicians?</p><p>&gt;The context in<br/>&gt;which it was originally offered is no longer in my memory, so I&apos;ll be happy<br/>&gt;just to drop this one.</p><p>OK.</p><p>&gt;Clearly you were not using the term as I had intended it.
