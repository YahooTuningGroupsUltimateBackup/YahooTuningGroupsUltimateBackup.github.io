As a layperson, I might call it a<br/>kind of &quot;transitive property&quot;: if ratios a + b = c, then the best<br/>approximations of a + b yield the best approximation of c also.[1]</p><p>Note that this concept can be applied to whatever rational or<br/>irrational ratios we happen to be approximating for a given style or<br/>piece of music: it can apply to a Partchian 7-limit model, or a<br/>Pythagorean model, or a neo-Gothic 17-flavor.</p><p>Turning to 24-tET, I would like to explore the alternative approaches<br/>of &quot;set-consistency&quot; and &quot;flavor-consistency.&quot;</p><p>Please let me emphasize that what follows is not a rigorous<br/>demonstration or proof, only a suggestion that 24-tET _may_ be<br/>consistent for certain interesting sets or flavors when these concepts<br/>are applied.</p><p>To keep this discussion musically grounded, I have chosen sets and<br/>flavors of special interest for my own musicmaking, and which have<br/>made 24-tET an intriguing alternative for me.</p><p>Needless to say, readers can and should substitute their own favorite<br/>alternative musics and intonational styles in applying and testing<br/>these concepts. In neo-Gothic music, it may be the unstable nature of<br/>thirds which invites their intonation in a wide spectrum of flavors;<br/>but a 20th-21st century outlook seeking the emancipation of intervals<br/>at all points of the continuum could have a similar effect quite<br/>outside Gothic or other historical norms of stability/instability.</p><p>-------------------------------------<br/>1. Set-consistency (2-3-7) and 24-tET<br/>-------------------------------------</p><p>Let&apos;s suppose, for example, that we want to use 24-tET for music in a<br/>neo-Gothic style based on ratios of 3 and 7, but not 5. We can speak<br/>of the &quot;set-consistency&quot; of 24-tET for ratios of 2-3-7.</p><p>Starting with basic Pythagorean ratios of 2 and 3, we might begin by<br/>quickly confirming that the best approximations of 3:2, 4:3, and 9:8<br/>&quot;add up&quot; as expected, so that a ~4:3 fourth plus a ~9:8 major second<br/>equal a ~3:2 fifth. We can alternatively test whether two fourths add<br/>up to the best approximation of a 16:9 minor seventh. In the following<br/>diagrams, I use a MIDI-style octave notation with C4 as middle C:</p><p>          ~3:2                                     ~16:9<br/>           700                                      1000<br/>|-----------------------|               |-------------------------|<br/>D3              G3      A3              D3           G3           C4<br/>0               500     700             0            500         1000<br/>|----------------|------|               |-------------|-----------|<br/>       ~4:3        ~9:8                       ~4:3        ~4:3<br/>        500         200                        500         500</p><p>As we might have guessed, since the 24-tET fifth at 700 cents is quite<br/>close to the Pythagorean 3:2 (~701.955 cents), these 3-based intervals<br/>behave in a consistent manner. The 200-cent major second, to use a<br/>medieval phrase, defines &quot;the difference of the consonances,&quot; that is<br/>the difference between the 500-cent fourth and the 700-cent fifth. Two<br/>500-cent fourths likewise add up to a 1000 cent minor seventh, the<br/>best approximation of 16:9 (~996.09 cents).</p><p>Turning to 7-based intervals within our relevant set, we now consider<br/>8:7 and 7:4; 7:6 and 12:7; and 9:7 or 14:9.</p><p>One informal way to approach the question of consistency is to look at<br/>two typical 7-based cadential sonorities in their closest 24-tET<br/>approximations: 12:14:18:21 (a rounded 0-267-702-969 cents in JI), and<br/>14:18:21:24 (a rounded 0-435-702-933 cents in JI).</p><p>To provide 24-tET spellings for examples of these sonorities, I use an<br/>asterisk (*) to show a note raised by 50 cents, and a &quot;d&quot; to show a<br/>note lowered by this same amount.</p><p>Let&apos;s look at a ~12:14:18:21 and a ~14:18:21:24 built above the same<br/>note, C3, diagramming all six intervals of these sonorities. What we<br/>find suggests 3-7 set-consistency while revealing a fascinating<br/>pattern of ambiguity:</p><p>     ~12:14:18:21 in 24-tET                  ~14:18:21:24 in 24-tET<br/>     (0-250-700-950 cents)                   (0-450-700-950 cents)</p><p>             ~7:4                                    ~12:7<br/>              950                                     950<br/>|---------------------------|           |----------------------------|<br/>C3      Ebd3         G3    Bbd3         C3         E*3      G3      A*3<br/>0       250          700   950          0          450      700     950<br/>|--------|----------|-------|           |-----------|--------|-------|<br/>   ~7:6       ~9:7       ~7:6                 ~9:7     ~7:6    ~8:7<br/>    250        450        250                  450      250     250<br/>         |------------------|                       |----------------|<br/>                  ~3:2                                     ~4:3<br/>                   700                                      500</p><p>For each sonority, we are indeed using the best 24-tET approximations<br/>for all six intervals, with 7-based intervals quite &quot;consistently&quot;<br/>and not-so-accurately varying by about 15-19 cents from pure.</p><p>At the same time, we notice that the 250-cent interval of 24-tET<br/>serves as a consistent approximation of _either_ an 8:7 (~231 cents)<br/>or a 7:6 (~267 cents). Likewise, 950 cents is the best and consistent<br/>approximation for either the 12:7 (~933 cents) of the first sonority<br/>or the 7:4 (~969 cents) of the second sonority.</p><p>For the three-voice 4:6:7 (0-702-967 cents in JI) and 14:21:24<br/>(0-702-933 cents in JI), in fact, the two approximations are an<br/>identical as well as consistent 0-700-950 cents:</p><p>           ~7:4                                    ~12:7<br/>            950                                     950<br/>|-------------------------|             |-------------------------|<br/>C3               G3      Bbd3           C3               G3&#x9; A*3<br/>0               700      950            0               700      950<br/>|----------------|--------|             |----------------|--------|<br/>       ~3:2         ~7:6                       ~3:2         ~8:7<br/>        700          250                        700          250</p><p>The distinction between these two interpretations of 0-700-950 cents<br/>could be made by their standard contractive or expansive resolutions:<br/>the small minor seventh and upper minor third of the first example<br/>contracting respectively to the fifth and unison; and the wide major<br/>sixth and upper major second of the second example expanding to the<br/>octave and upper fourth of the resolving sonority:</p><p>   Bbd3 A3           A*3 Bb3<br/>   G3   A3           G3  F3<br/>   C3   D3           C3  Bb2</p><p>(m7-5 + m3-1)    (M6-8 + M2-4)</p><p>Thus it turns out that 24-tET is apparently set-consistent for ratios<br/>of 2-3-7, although not especially accurate for 7-based intervals -- an<br/>&quot;inaccuracy&quot; inviting the kind of musical puns for which 12-divisible<br/>n-tET&apos;s are famous.</p><p>This ambiguity, as compared to a JI or near-JI system for the relevant<br/>set of ratios, might be seen as a special attraction of 24-tET.</p><p>A theorist who takes simple JI ratios as the central focus for<br/>psychoacoustics might characterize 24-tET as &quot;consistent/ambiguous for<br/>ratios of 2-3-7,&quot; and point to the ambiguity of the system as a prime<br/>artistic virtue, an artful distortion, as it were.</p><p>At the same time, if we are seeking in a given context to realize<br/>rather than to neutralize the intonational distinction between a 12:7<br/>and a 7:4, for example, looking at accuracy as well as set-consistency<br/>suggests that other tunings might be more likely choices.</p><p>If looking for a 24-note tuning with the symmetry of a 12-divisible<br/>equal temperament, we might consider 24-out-of-36-tET with two manuals<br/>tuned 1/6-tone (~33.33 cents) apart.</p><p>This gives us superb approximations of 7-based intervals, plus a fine<br/>17-flavor of &quot;submajor/supraminor&quot; thirds at ~333.33 cents (~17:14)<br/>and 366.67 cents (~21:17). Unlike 24-tET, this system involves the<br/>asymmetry that not all intervals are available from all steps --<br/>possibly an extra motivation for 33-cent &quot;diesis shifts&quot; between the<br/>two manuals.</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>2. &quot;Flavor-consistency&quot; and 24-tET<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>From another point of view, we can use a concept which might be termed<br/>&quot;flavor-consistency&quot; to say more specifically what 24-tET does most<br/>accurately.</p><p>As is well known, either 12-tET or its superset of 24-tET is<br/>consistent and rather accurate for the usual Pythagorean intervals,<br/>with fifths and fourths within 2 cents of pure; major seconds and<br/>minor sevenths within 4 cents of 9:8 and 16:9; and the various types<br/>of thirds and sixths within 6-8 cents of their ideal Pythagorean or<br/>&quot;3-flavor&quot; sizes, albeit on the &quot;subdued&quot; or &quot;diluted&quot; side.</p><p>Additionally, however, we notice that 24-tET seems to have excellent<br/>approximations of what I call &quot;13-flavor&quot; intervals: major thirds at<br/>around 13:10 (~454 cents); wide major seconds or narrow minor thirds<br/>at around 15:13 (~248 cents); wide major sixths or narrow minor<br/>sevenths at around 26:15 (~952 cents); and narrow minor sixths at<br/>around 20:13 (~746 cents).</p><p>Looking again at our four-voice sonorities suggests that 24-tET is<br/>both &quot;flavor-consistent&quot; (best approximations used for every interval)<br/>and admirably accurate (if not quite as close as 29-tET) for the<br/>13-flavor:</p><p>           ~26:15                                  ~26:15<br/>             950                                     950<br/>|---------------------------|           |----------------------------|<br/>C3      Ebd3       G3      Bbd3         C3         E*3      G3      A*3<br/>0       250        700     950          0          450      700     950<br/>|--------|----------|-------|           |-----------|--------|-------|<br/>  ~15:13    ~13:10   ~15:13                 ~13:10    ~15:13  ~15:13<br/>    250       450      250                    450       250     250<br/>         |------------------|                       |----------------|<br/>                 ~3:2                                      ~4:3<br/>                  700                                       500</p><p>For these 13-flavor sonorities, 24-tET is not only consistent but<br/>accurate to within 5 cents for all intervals.</p><p>Additionally, 24-tET also appears to be both consistent and accurate<br/>for the neo-Gothic &quot;49-flavor&quot; of neutral thirds and sixths with<br/>ratios of around 49:40 (~351 cents) and 80:49 (~849 cents), with its<br/>approximations of 350 cents and 850 cents.[1] Again, the intervals<br/>seem to &quot;add up&quot; as expected, for example in this 49-flavor variation<br/>on a minor sixth sonority also featuring a ~12:11 &quot;neutral second&quot;<br/>between the two highest voices (the difference between the 700-cent<br/>fifth and 850-cent neutral sixth above the lowest part):</p><p>                     ~80:49<br/>                       850<br/>         |-------------------------|<br/>         C3       Eb*3     G3     Ab*3<br/>         0        350      700    850<br/>         |---------|--------|------|<br/>           ~49:40    ~49:40  ~12:11<br/>             350       350     150<br/>                   |---------------|<br/>                         ~4:3<br/>                          500</p><p>To sum up, taking a &quot;flavor-consistency&quot; approach we might say that<br/>24-tET offers a somewhat diluted 3-flavor (fifths and fourths quite<br/>accurate, regular &quot;semi-Pythagorean&quot; thirds and sixths a bit on the<br/>mild side), and fine approximations of 13-flavor and 49-flavor<br/>sonorities. Each of these flavors seems to add up consistently, at<br/>least at first blush.</p><p>An advantage of these offshoots of the classic Erlich &quot;n-limit&quot;<br/>paradigm of consistency is that we can look at the possibilities of an<br/>equal temperament from different musical angles. The question might be<br/>summed up: &quot;Consistency for what?&quot; with an answer which may be<br/>different from piece to piece.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. Paul Erlich, &quot;Tuning, Tonality, and Twenty-Two-Tone Temperament,&quot;<br/>_Xenharmonikon_ 17:12-40 (Spring 1998), at 13 n. 8, provides a<br/>definition of classic n-limit consistency. A tuning is not consistent<br/>within a given limit &quot;if for some odd numbers a, b, and c less than or<br/>equal to the limit, the best approximation of b:a plus the best<br/>approximation of c:b does not equal the best approximation of c:a.&quot;</p><p>2. For typical neo-Gothic tunings along the spectrum from Pythagorean<br/>to 22-tET, with fifths at a pure 3:2 or wider (~701.96-709.09 cents),<br/>49:40 (~351.34 cents) divides such a fifth into two almost precisely<br/>equal parts, and so may be a more convenient ratio to represent a<br/>neutral third than the simpler 11:9 (~347.41 cents). Although 24-tET<br/>is more of a &quot;semi-Gothic&quot; tuning with its slightly narrow fifths at<br/>700 cents, its neutral third at 350 cents remains slightly closer to<br/>49:40 than to 11:9. If we were to take 11:9 as an ideal (with a<br/>neutral sixth at 18:11), this would not seem to alter our impression<br/>that 24-tET is both consistent and accurate to within 3 cents for<br/>sonorities combining these neutral intervals with regular fifths or<br/>fourths, and/or neutral seconds or sevenths at ~12:11 and ~11:6.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2001 10:56:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
