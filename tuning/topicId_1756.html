In which case you&apos;ll<br/>probably want the rungs to represent consonances.  Your version requires<br/>rungs for every odd factor, consonant or not.  Paul Hahn does agree that<br/>odd-limit (not prime-limit) is a good measure of consonance, and he wants<br/>to use it to gauge the complexity of other intervals that arise in music<br/>(perhaps a bit like the prime-limit advocates do with prime numbers).</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3><a id=1772 href="#1772">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Odd limit is right if the<br/>number of dimensions of the matrix is unlimited.</p><p>&gt;If you&apos;re going to go with city-block, you<br/>&gt;must be interested in lattice-rung factorization.

The decision will<br/>have a certain amount of arbitrariness.</p><p>&gt;Your version requires<br/>&gt;rungs for every odd factor, consonant or not.</p><p>If you could decide how many dimensions you need, I would only have<br/>rungs for consonant ones. That is, if you could decide the highest<br/>odd-limit for which consonance applies, the number of dimensions would<br/>be that minus one, over two (assuming you&apos;re using odd axes and<br/>redundant lattice points, rather than prime axes and wormholes).</p><p>&gt;Paul Hahn does agree that<br/>&gt;odd-limit (not prime-limit) is a good measure of consonance, and he<br/>wants<br/>&gt;to use it to gauge the complexity of other intervals that arise in<br/>music<br/>&gt;(perhaps a bit like the prime-limit advocates do with prime numbers).</p><p>So do I, but as Partch considered 9:5 a ratio of 9 and 11:5 a ratio of<br/>11, and I agree with him, I had a problem with the Hahn/Op de Coul<br/>algorithm, as it assigned the latter a smaller distance than the former.<br/>Clearly 225 is way too high an odd number to be part of consonant ratios<br/>(in lowest terms), but since the competing harmonic complexity formulae<br/>didn&apos;t impose any limit to the number of dimensions in the lattice, why<br/>should mine? I wanted to create something parallel so it could be used<br/>by Manuel&apos;s program. Yes, it would be better to ask for an odd limit for<br/>the lattice and compute the distance based on that. But the basic<br/>insight is that a triangular lattice, with Tenney-like lengths, a<br/>city-block metric, and odd axes or wormholes, agrees with the odd limit<br/>perfectly, and so is the best octave-invariant lattice representation<br/>(with associated metric) for anyone as Partchian as me.</p></div>
