The 3&apos;s limit was about 20 steps up and down from<br/>1/1, the 5&apos;s about 12, the 7&apos;s about 8 and the higher primes<br/>proportionally less (up to the 41st). To limit the size of the table,<br/>the complexity of each interval limited to 60, though I did smaller<br/>tables as well. Complexity was defined as the sum of the product of each<br/>prime times the absolute value of its exponent.</p><p>We also sent him our ET tables, all the ET&apos;s from 5 to 120-tet plus a<br/>few extras such as 144, 171, etc. computed to 8 places (IIRC) with<br/>string lengths, decimals, and hz (on A440, C264, C256) as well. These<br/>computations were done on a large CDC machine in FORTRAN at UCSD in<br/>1967-68. Times have changed!</p><p>--John</p></div>
