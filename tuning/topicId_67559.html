Technically 46 is inconsistent but there&apos;s only one obvious way of mapping it.  26 might have some significance as well.  Anyway, you can get 2-D temperaments by pairing those off.</p><p>Mystery58 is indeed good.  Every 15-limit interval has either a complexity of 0 or 1, meaning it either uses one 29-et cycle or both of them.  But it comes out a lot worst in average complexity.  I think some diaschismic extensions come out better there, two of which Erv looked at, so try 46&amp;58.  Some 15-limit intervals will be more complex but the average consonance is simpler.  Or the simpler consonances tend to be more simple.  I forget what the accuracy is.</p><p>Maybe 58&amp;72 has something going for it as well.  If you want to check, I&apos;ve still got the searches online, something like</p><p><a href="http://microtonal.co.uk/temper">http://microtonal.co.uk/temper</a></p><p>and if you run the code locally you can do weighted searches as well.</p><p>If you want a Partchian JI superscale, 58 notes is a good place to<br/>start.</p><p>In practical terms, it may well be that 13 is too complicated.  There&apos;s still a notable absence of 13-limit music out there.  It might be more fruitful to look at different subsets.

Obviously 1/1 has to map to<br/>&gt;&gt; the first note and 2/1 to the last, so I take out the extra<br/>&gt;&gt; 1/1s and 2/1s. (In larger scales, you&apos;ll get multiple cases<br/>&gt;&gt; of 3/2, 4/3 and so on, so in an equal temperament, find which<br/>&gt;&gt; pitch the ratio maps to and remove all instances of the ratio<br/>&gt;&gt; outside of that pitch.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; After that, use only the simplest fractions left over.</p><p>&gt; How do you resolve the contensions?  Order matters.  It<br/>&gt; seems like you take the available ratios in increasing order<br/>&gt; of complexity and find their best approximations in the<br/>&gt; scale.  But then it&apos;s unclear what purpose approximating the<br/>&gt; scale members seperately serves in the first place -- just<br/>&gt; start with 1/1 and go up in Tenney limit (num * den) until<br/>&gt; all scale tones are mapped.  (?)</p><p>I took the available ratios in order and used the simplest ones I could without having the same ratio map to more than one pitch. It would be a good idea when working with equal temperaments to take the simplest fraction in each pitch, calculate which degree of ET the note is closest too, and if the numbers don&apos;t match, move on to the next ratio in each set. In 12-TET, 2/1 appears as the first ratio for all the pitches from perfect fourth to perfect octave, but since it properly maps only to the octave, you cross out 2/1 on all the other pitches and go on to the next one. And several pitches have 3/4 in their lists, but you only use 3/4 in the perfect fifth, and so on.</p><p>Ratios that are not too much more complex may be used as alternates, such as 18/17 in place of 17/16 for the minor second in 12-TET.</p><p>The Tenney limit method might work better though.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Another variation of this method, used only for equal and<br/>&gt;&gt; symmetrical temperaments, is to use the simplest fractions for<br/>&gt;&gt; pitches that are the inverse (2/p) of their octave complements.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s p?</p><p>The frequency of the particular note in relation to the first pitch, but I could&apos;ve just as easily used &apos;r&apos; for ratio.</p><p>~D.</p></div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2006 3:29:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Graham Breed wrote (about my 13-limit question):</p><p>&gt; I think the stand-out equal temperaments go 29, 46, 58, 72, ...<br/>&gt; Technically 46 is inconsistent but there&apos;s only one obvious way of<br/>&gt; mapping it.  26 might have some significance as well.
