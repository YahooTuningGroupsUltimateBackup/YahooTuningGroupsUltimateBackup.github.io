In particular, are these lattices<br/>&gt;showing anything of value?</p><p>Honestly, not that I can see. As you know, I prefer to draw lattices where<br/>the consonant intervals get the shortest distances (possibly in a<br/>multi-dimensional space), regardless of whether the consonances are pure or<br/>tempered. If anything, tempering can give you reasons to add more dimensions<br/>in your lattice, so that scales can fold and twist in order to portray the<br/>vanishing commas of temperament.</p><p>&gt;In the sheet in that file named &apos;comparative&apos;, you can also<br/>&gt;see my musings on the usual 2^(x*7/12) 12-EDO cycle of &apos;5ths&apos;.<br/>&gt;I noticed that 2^(x/12) 12-EDO appears to be exactly the same<br/>&gt;as 1/11-comma meantone.  Has anyone else ever pointed that out?</p><p>Yes -- I even mention that fact in my paper, and the footnote cites Barbour.</p><p>&gt;Is there any kind of significance to that?  More directly, my<br/>&gt;question is: can you show me mathematically how the 1/11-comma<br/>&gt;formula is the same as 2^(x/12)?</p><p>It&apos;s only approximately true, and it&apos;s due to the fact that the syntonic<br/>comma is approximately 11/12 the size of the Pythagorean comma.</p><p>Joe, I won&apos;t be able to check my e-mail for a week, so if you need to reach<br/>me use the list (as long as it concerns tuning, of course).</p><p>-Paul</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We are Moving!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div>
