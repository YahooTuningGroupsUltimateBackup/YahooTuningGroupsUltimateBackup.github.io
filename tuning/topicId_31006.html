This was exactly what<br/>I was looking for and didn&apos;t find when I was surfing Turkish<br/>music websites. For some reason I just forgot to post the right<br/>question here.</p><p>On a related note, have you ever read Maqam by Signell? I actually<br/>have a pretty good library for Middle Eastern tuning books nearby<br/>that I keep meaning to go back to, but I think thats the only<br/>book there that was in English. (It is pretty recent, I think<br/>DeCapo press, and well out of print by now).</p><p>thanks again</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
