This was a great chart.  Actually, I remember<br/>&gt; &gt; this &quot;linear&quot; part of it too...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So now you can immediately see, for just about any ET, how good its<br/>&gt; approximations are, _and_ how bad its syntonic comma problems will<br/>&gt; be. Much better than a simple list as in my post today.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I guess they would be in a straight line because the relationship<br/>&gt; &gt; between the just intervals is in the same proportion in the<br/>&gt; meantones<br/>&gt; &gt; (that&apos;s a guess...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pretty much . . . since four perfect fourths must equal a major<br/>&gt; third, the errors in these intervals must obey a _linear_<br/>&gt; relationship:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4*(flatness of fifth) + (sharpness of major third) = syntonic comma<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is true for _any_ meantone tuning, not just meantone ETs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Was *this* a valid post??
