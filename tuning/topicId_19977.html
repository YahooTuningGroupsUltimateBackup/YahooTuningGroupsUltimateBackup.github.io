What a treat, a few messages<br/>later, that you had already corrected my error by posting the right<br/>URL -- and giving lots of possibly puzzled users access to the<br/>material!</p><p>Pine recognizes URL&apos;s in received mail, but not to my knowledge in a<br/>user&apos;s outgoing message text. One test method I have sometimes used is to<br/>send an article first to myself, and try the links, before posting to<br/>the list. Another might be to learn enough HTML to make a file which<br/>the Lynx browser could read and use to treat a URL as a link, then go<br/>through a post and use Emacs to copy any URL&apos;s into this file, then<br/>upload the file to my ISP and try Lynx on it.</p><p>Anyway, Joseph, you&apos;re a real friend, to me and everyone here. Thanks<br/>so much.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/9/2001 6:30:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

(When Paul was here,<br/>such details were generally reported even MORE frequently! :) )</p><p>&gt; Anyway, Joseph, you&apos;re a real friend, to me and everyone here.<br/>Thanks so much.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you so very much for this statement and, I would like to say<br/>that I am very honored by your friendship and all the other people on<br/>this list.  (And I even mean Jon Szanto! --- John, I had to do that,<br/>:), of course you&apos;re part of it...)</p><p>Quite frankly, there have been rare occasions in my lifetime where I<br/>have been able to meet and exchange ideas on music on the<br/>intellectual plateau that exists here on the Tuning List...  Have I<br/>become, for the time being, a Tuning List &quot;junkie??&quot;  Quite possibly,<br/>but I&apos;m loving every minute of it...</p><p>Oh... and regarding &quot;Early Music&quot; issues (another morning listening<br/>&quot;addiction...&quot;) might it be possible for you to post, perhaps as an<br/>addendum to your wonderful articles  (or maybe even a separate post),<br/>some specific PIECES and composers that pertain to your discussions??</p><p>It&apos;s always a good occasion for me to investigate some SPECIFIC Early<br/>Music pieces and, frankly, the most fun is when I have to &quot;special<br/>order&quot; the CD...  I guess that&apos;s an interesting &quot;psychological&quot;<br/>phenominon...  When it finally arrives, what joy!  (Such happened<br/>with the Solage some time ago...)</p><p>And as a bit of advertising again... I would urge anybody interested<br/>in Early Music to investigate the site at:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/">http://www.medieval.org/</a></p><p>I plan to study every bit of it when I get a chance...</p><p>Thanks so much again!<br/>_______ _____ ______ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
