I&apos;m sure the method will be of great<br/>practical value in creating more playable microtempered<br/>fretted instruments.  I was surprised at just how few partial<br/>frets you can get away with, which makes bending the notes<br/>practical on almost all frets.  Also, because your method<br/>maximises the number of full-width frets, it also increases<br/>their spacing, which helps articulate notes cleanly without<br/>buzzing.</p><p>I&apos;m impressed!</p><p>And glad you made it available without waiting any longer.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Apologies to those who have already seen this via the MakeMicroMusic<br/>Yahoo group.</p><p>I decided it was time I stopped waiting for it to be published in<br/>Xenharmonikon 18 and put this article up on the web, since I wrote it<br/>a year and a half ago and developed the method nearly four years ago.</p><p>I note that the core of the method is applicable to all &quot;linear&quot;<br/>tunings, whether approximating JI or not.</p><p><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/MicroGuitar.pdf">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/Music/MicroGuitar.pdf</a></p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p><p>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.322 / Virus Database: 267.3.0 - Release Date: 30/5/05</p></div>
