While my<br/>idea may hardly be new, the wider application of it could generate<br/>lots of excitement in our community.</p><p>First, to make my own leanings clear, I should affirm that I tend to<br/>consider 6:7 as an _optimized_ minor third, naming one of my favorite<br/>just tunings in honor of this ratio. Describing the same interval as a<br/>&quot;bruised&quot; minor third is a rather different viewpoint, one which both<br/>Paul and I seem both to find curious -- but which could be quite<br/>descriptive in a musical context where some other size is expected.</p><p>Specifically, musicians and listeners accustomed to styles where minor<br/>thirds are tuned at or near 5:6 might consider 6:7 &quot;bruised&quot; -- and<br/>one place to look for such a viewpoint is in 16th-century Europe, the<br/>milieu of the great enharmonicist, or as we might now say<br/>&quot;microtonalist,&quot; Vicentino (1511-1576).</p><p>As you noted, Paul, Vicentino indeed finds the &quot;proximate minor third&quot;<br/>of about 9/31 octave (approximately in a 31-note circulating system of<br/>1/4-comma meantone, precisely in 31-tET) more &quot;consonant&quot; than the<br/>&quot;proximate major third&quot; at about 11/31 octave. He identifies these<br/>ratios as approximately &quot;5-1/2:4-1/2&quot; or 11:9, and &quot;4-1/2:3-1/2&quot; or<br/>9:7, and we can confirm these approximate sizes by looking at the<br/>intervals of either 1/4-comma or 31-tET, both fitting his description<br/>of a division of the whole-tone into five more-or-less equal dieses.</p><p>He remarks that while the near-11:9 is &quot;rather consonant,&quot; tending<br/>toward the consonance of the usual major third, the near-9:7 tends<br/>more toward the fourth, an interval of somewhat equivocal status in<br/>16th-century practice, and thus leaning more toward dissonance. He<br/>urges more caution in treating the latter interval, although he finds<br/>it acceptable in passing. In contrast, some of his four-voice<br/>enharmonic (i.e. fifthtone) cadences feature an ornament in which one<br/>of the voices moves in fifthtones from a minor third to a &quot;proximate<br/>minor&quot; one to a concluding major third -- about 8/31, 9/31, and 10/31<br/>octave respectively, or approximately 6:5, 11:9, 5:4.</p><p>From Vicentino&apos;s perspective, interestingly, the &quot;minimal third&quot; a<br/>diesis smaller than the regular minor interval, or about 7/31 octave,<br/>is indeed too narrow to serve as a persuasive consonance. He remarks<br/>that the usual minor third is such that to tune it smaller is to make<br/>it approach the &quot;dissonance&quot; of &quot;a second&quot; -- that is, the major<br/>second. While he does not, as far as I am aware, give an approximate<br/>integer ratio for this &quot;minimal third,&quot; at 7/5-tone it would be very<br/>close to 7:6 in either 1/4-comma or 31-tET.</p><p>Indeed &quot;bruised minor third&quot; might be a rather descriptive way of<br/>expressing this kind of viewpoint. Whatever musical factors may have<br/>contributed to his opinion, we know that he was not shy about<br/>championing other &quot;unconventional&quot; intervals such as the 11:9 third.<br/>Further, of course, he was famed for championing the melodic use of<br/>the enharmonic or fifthtone step, which other musicians of the era<br/>such as Gioseffo Zarlino and Vincenzo Galilei asserted was<br/>ill-proportioned either to the ear (Galilei) or to modern part-music<br/>(Zarlino, who accepted the enharmonic genus for the kind of monophonic<br/>singing he attributed to the ancient Greeks).</p><p>However, even in settings where 6:5 minor thirds are taken as the<br/>norm, some musicians are ready to accept a 6:7 or near-6:7 third as an<br/>acceptable &quot;equivalent.&quot; Thus Owen Jorgensen takes the view that a<br/>narrow minor third in a meantone tuning does not become a &quot;Wolf&quot; --<br/>unlike a wide major third, for example -- but rather approaches the<br/>ratio of 6:7, which he considers concordant. This means, for example,<br/>that Bb3-C#4-F4 (near-6:7 augmented second below) might serve in such<br/>as setting as an acceptable &quot;triad with narrow minor third&quot; -- a<br/>&quot;subminor triad&quot; as xenharmonicists often describe it -- where<br/>F#4-Bb4-C#4 would be considered &quot;unplayable&quot; as an equivalent for a<br/>regular major triad.</p><p>As someone involved with Gothic and neo-Gothic music where narrow<br/>minor thirds ranging from around 7:6 to the Pythagorean 32:27 (~294.13<br/>cents) are the rule, my leaning toward these thirds might not be<br/>surprising. Here I can share an early impression in a 24-note version<br/>of 1/4-comma meantone which could be considered a subset of<br/>Vicentino&apos;s 31-note cycle.</p><p>Using a &quot;buzzy&quot; harmonic timbre somewhat like a crumhorn or regal<br/>organ (both Renaissance double reed instruments), I found that the<br/>near-11:9 seemed rather complex, and the near-7:6 rather smooth -- for<br/>me, a reasonable equivalent for the usual near-6:5 minor third.</p><p>In this kind of musical setting, I found the near-9:7 (precisely 32:25<br/>in 1/4-comma, ~427.37 cents) quite different from a usual pure 5:4:<br/>very pleasing either in some idiomatic Renaissance treatments, or as a<br/>&quot;neo-Gothic&quot; major third expanding to a fifth, but nonequivalent to a<br/>regular major third in a 16th-century texture.</p><p>My interest in the near-7:6 was in part motivated by exigency. I have<br/>taken a liking to a kind of fifthtone progression recommended by<br/>Vicentino and mentioned above where a voice moves by these enharmonic<br/>steps from minor through &quot;proximate minor&quot; or neutral third to major<br/>third, here shown with an asterisk (*) indicating a note raised by a<br/>diesis:</p><p>                   G3<br/>                   Eb3 Eb*3 E3<br/>                   C3</p><p>In 1618, Fabio Colonna carried this kind of progression further,<br/>showing a &quot;sliding of the voice&quot; through fifthtones like the<br/>following (not his precise four-voice example but a three-voice<br/>progression along similar lines):</p><p>                  Bb3 Bb*3 B3 B*3 C4<br/>                  F3              E3<br/>                  D3              C3</p><p>With a 31-note cycle, as used by both Vicentino and Colonna on their<br/>&quot;superkeyboards,&quot; these progressions could be transposed to any step.<br/>However, with my 24-note tuning set, I found that from some locations<br/>my closest equivalent was something like:</p><p>                  F4<br/>                  C#4 C#*4/Db4 D4<br/>                  Bb3</p><p>Here the neutral third Bb3-Db*4 is not available, so instead I came up<br/>with a variant of Vicentino&apos;s progression: start with a minimal or<br/>subminor third, then move to a regular minor third, and from there to<br/>a concluding major third. This is approximately 7:6, 6:5, 5:4, with<br/>the last interval just in 1/4-comma tuning.</p><p>I liked it very much, although it is melodically as well as<br/>harmonically different from Vicentino&apos;s progression: his features two<br/>equal fifthtone steps (Eb3-Eb*3-E3), while mine has a fifthtone<br/>followed by a chromatic semitone (C#4-C#*4/Db4-D4).</p><p>This kind of thing also led me to a variation of Colonna&apos;s longer<br/>&quot;slide&quot; in fifthtones:</p><p>               D5              E5<br/>               A4              B4<br/>               F#*4 F#4 F*4 F4 E4</p><p>Here the thirds between the lower voices are ~7:6, ~6:5, ~11:9, 5:4,<br/>leading to a usual cadence with descending semitone and ascending<br/>whole-tones in the other voices.</p><p>Thus I found pragmatically that in a texture based on more or less<br/>&quot;usual&quot; 16th-century-style counterpoint -- doubtless with my own<br/>idiosyncrasies and liberties -- 7:6 and 6:5 are readily interchanged.<br/>In contrast, 5:4 and 32:25 (Vicentino&apos;s near-9:7) seem radically<br/>divergent, the latter inviting either specific &quot;diminished fourth&quot;<br/>treatments of the period, or a neo-Gothic context where it makes a<br/>fine cadential major third.</p><p>One way to put this is that 7:6 has a &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;sweet&quot; effect, while<br/>a large major third such as 9:7 belongs to a realm of &quot;brilliance&quot; and<br/>energy quite apart from that of 5:4 in a harmonic timbre. That was my<br/>impression as it might apply to a discussion like this.</p><p>In a neo-Gothic setting, those large major thirds seem to me &quot;bright,&quot;<br/>&quot;sunny,&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot;: it is a different world or quantum level.<br/>However, a friend who heard me play a regular tuning with pure 11:14<br/>major thirds found the thirds quite different from what she would<br/>expected for this category, describing them as &quot;dark,&quot; suggesting some<br/>kind of deep forest.</p><p>This happened to be in my &quot;Puff Pipes&quot; timbre -- or actually Yamaha&apos;s<br/>preset voice on the TX-802 -- which I consider quite mild or<br/>&quot;pastelized,&quot; the kind of thing that makes 17-tET very relaxed and<br/>agreeable for 14th-century music with major thirds near the proposed<br/>point of maximum entropy for a harmonic timbre.</p><p>For me, those thirds were routine and delightful; for her, they were<br/>notably &quot;different&quot; and &quot;dark.&quot; Here the instrument and timbre were<br/>the same, showing that opinions can vary.</p><p>Maybe we should distinguish between three different problems, however<br/>related:</p><p>           (1) Who &quot;likes&quot; a given interval size, and why;</p><p>           (2) Whether such a size is contextually &quot;congruous&quot;<br/>               or &quot;incongruous&quot; to a given listener in a given<br/>               style, and why -- with mileage apparently<br/>               varying on the 7:6 in a Renaissance meantone<br/>               kind of setting, for example; and</p><p>           (3) How such opinions and conventions might tie in<br/>               with more general models of &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;<br/>               or the like.</p><p>To make this more concrete, and also especially exciting from a<br/>viewpoint of practical musicmaking, one approach might be to document<br/>how some of us combine tunings, timbres, and styles -- e.g. &quot;I really<br/>like a regular 11:14 tuning with PuffPipes,&quot; or &quot;With this timbre I<br/>can happily use a 9:7 in a Renaissance-stye texture as if it were a<br/>5:4.&quot;</p><p>Then we might study the spectrum of the timbre -- itself a fluid<br/>reality, as Jacky Ligon has observed -- and see how this might affect<br/>the &quot;minima&quot; and &quot;maxima&quot; of an entropy model, or the &quot;steepness&quot; of<br/>the curve.</p><p>One might ask, for example, whether an agreeably &quot;pastelized&quot; texture<br/>shifts the points on the curve, or evens out the peaks and valleys, or<br/>some combination of these effects.</p><p>We could also do comparisons. If I report: &quot;Yes, I also love<br/>sonorities with 11:14 in this harmonic timbre,&quot; then it might be a<br/>question of a taste for relatively complex thirds, stylistically quite<br/>congruous in a neo-Gothic setting, rather than simply of pastelized<br/>textures.</p><p>Similarly, if other people share the reaction of my friend that thirds<br/>of this size in a &quot;pastelized&quot; texture sound &quot;unusual&quot; or &quot;dark&quot; while<br/>I find them &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;accustomed,&quot; then something other than<br/>timbre alone may be involved -- a matter of taste, either stylistic or<br/>more idiosyncratic.</p><p>Concretizing harmonic entropy in this way, and getting people more<br/>involved in comparing notes in actual tunings and timbres which might<br/>be replicated, could be a way not only of developing the theory but of<br/>making it of interest to more people -- and of fostering the<br/>microtonal music which the theory addresses at the same time.</p><p>Most appreciatively, with happy holidays to all,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=31913 href="#31913">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/25/2001 11:10:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
