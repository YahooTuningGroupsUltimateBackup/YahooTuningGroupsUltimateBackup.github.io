The first and third group contain five semitone factors or five ratios of six tones.</p><p>The first group comprises the tones C, C#, D, Eb, E. The second group comprises the tones F# and G and the third one is formed by Ab, A, Bb, B, 2C.</p><p>The product of the five semitone factors that work in the first and third group equals 4/3 while the product of the two semitone factors of the second group equals 9/8.</p><p>If we call e1 to C#/C semitone factor; e2 to D/C#, e3 to ratio Eb/D....etc., the octave can be given as follows:</p><p>C#/C .......e1<br/>D/C# ...... e2<br/>Eb/D ...... e3<br/>E/Eb ...... e4<br/>F/E .........e5 .........(e1 x e2 x e3 x e4 x e5) = (4/3)</p><p>F#/F ...... e6<br/>G/F# ...... e7 ...........(e6 x e7) = (9/8)</p><p>Ab/G ...... e1<br/>A/Ab ...... e2<br/>Bb/A ...... e3<br/>B/Bb ...... e4<br/>2C/B ...... e5.........(e1 x e2 x e3 x e4 x e5) = (4/3)</p><p>(4/3) (9/8) (4/3) = 2</p><p>Three scales were calculated by using a different criterion and obtained 6 and 7 perfect fifths. On the other hand, three scales  were designed by using the explained method and showed 8 and 9 perfect  fifths. Similarly,  the number of perfect major thirds (1.25)  increased from 2 to 3.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario Pizarro</p><p><a href="mailto:piagui@ec-red.com">piagui@ec-red.com</a></p><p>Lima, July 21, 2009</p><p>02:00 p.m.</p></div>
