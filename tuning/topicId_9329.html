Those frets<br/>&gt; could get very tightly spaced with that scale length.</p><p>Other than the fact that (for the first time in 2.5 years or so, I have vacation<br/>coming up, and would like something a little less bulky to take with me than a<br/>guitar), the higher pitch range of the mandolin strikes me as better for<br/>complicated harmonies.  I&apos;ve noticed that complex harmonies, such as 7:9:11 can<br/>sound rather muddled in lower pitch ranges.</p></div>
