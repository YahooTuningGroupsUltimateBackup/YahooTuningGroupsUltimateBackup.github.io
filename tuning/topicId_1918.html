John, do you happen to know which paper this is in, or<br/>&gt; R&apos;s catchword for it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Mr. Lumma,</p><p>Thank you for your complimentary remarks on my work. I totally agree with<br/>your comment &quot;Vertical context is surely a big deal, but melody alone<br/>should have its own wonders to disclose, and these should be nailed down<br/>before moving on to bigger game,...&quot;.</p><p>In my humble judgement Turkish music has achieved multi-dimensionality,<br/>a form of musical &quot;richness&quot;, through multi-modality. There seems to be a<br/>very intricate grand structure made up of 120 some &grave;maqam&apos;s, interconnected<br/>in sophisticated ways, making up the &grave;universe&apos; for this music. An individual<br/>aspiring to become a master of this kind music has to learn and fully<br/>comprehend the musical &quot;architecture&quot; of the said structure. This is an<br/>extremely demanding proposition on the part of the apprentice, requiring<br/>many decades of training with persistence and dedication. Adding vertical<br/>context to such a structure, as some theoreticians have tried to do in the<br/>past, could be very risky if not totally inappropriate.</p><p>Regarding a quote from Chalmers, the term &quot;equivalence class&quot; has a very<br/>positive ring to my ears.</p><p>Can Akkoc<br/>Alabama School of Mathematics and Science<br/>Mobile, Alabama 36604-2519<br/>Phone: (334) 441-2126<br/>Fax  : (334) 441-3290</p></div>
