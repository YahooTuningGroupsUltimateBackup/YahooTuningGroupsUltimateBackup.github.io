As this competition is<br/>about tuning the drei equale as much &quot;in tune&quot; as possible.<br/>&quot;in tune&quot; beeing not defined, and is something that&apos;s very hard to define<br/>(but I will try to do so somewhere in the future), but I do hope it&apos;s<br/>something that atleast our ears / brain posesses.

Personally, although I&apos;ve worked with various email accounts, only once or twice in my life have I actually written a message on some webmail-like pages. I usually use some software that allows me to manage my account via pop3 (so far I&apos;ve never found an email interface which couldn&apos;t be controled this way). Within these programs, you can choose whether you want to send replies in the same format as the message you&apos;re repliing to (i.e. to reply with html if someone sends you html) and also what format you want to use for your own messages. I would be very surprised if these settings weren&apos;t also available on the webmail pages, supposing you&apos;re writing email via your web browser.</p><p>Although I&apos;ve used html a few times in the past, I&apos;m now feeling actually more comfortable with plain text so I&apos;ve changed the setting in my MSOE.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=87074 href="#87074">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2010 9:39:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I would be very surprised if these settings weren&apos;t also available on the<br/>&gt; webmail pages, supposing you&apos;re writing email via your web browser.</p><p>Yes web interface indeed, and found the button.<br/>Big button saying plain text.
