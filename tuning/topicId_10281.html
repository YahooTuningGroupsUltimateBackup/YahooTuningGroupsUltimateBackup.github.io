For example, the major triad is<br/>&gt;4:5:6 otonal and 1/15:1/12:1/10 utonal, so it&apos;s considered otonal, while the<br/>&gt;reverse is true for the minor triad.</p><p>Thanks, that&apos;s fitted in the last piece of the puzzle, and I understand how<br/>the dekany triads are classified as utonal and otonal, and why changing<br/>from 2)5 to 3)5 swaps one to the other.</p><p>- if you have a triad such as<br/>5*9, 1*5, 1*9<br/>= 45, 5, 9<br/>(in the 1,3,5,7,9 decany, which I&apos;m using for ref because of<br/>Dave Keenan&apos;s clear graph of it)</p><p>then it is utonal because it is far simpler as<br/>1*5*9/1, 1*5*9/9, 1*5*9/5<br/>= 1/1 1/9 1/5</p><p>while<br/>7*5, 1*5, 3*5 is otonal because of the common factor of 5,<br/>so that 7, 1, 3, is simpler than<br/>1*3*7*5/(1*3), 1*3*7*5/(3*7), 1*3*7*5/(1*7)<br/>= 1/3 1/21 1/7</p><p>Also explains why there are 5 tetrahedra - one for<br/>each of the factors. So for instance the tetrad for the 3 factor will be<br/>1*3, 3*5, 3*7, 3*9.</p><p>You&apos;ll then get five hexanies as well, for instance,<br/>one with all sets of 3 factors chosen from 1, 3, 5, 7<br/>or 1,3, 5, 9, or 1,3,7,9, or 1,5,7,9, or 3,5,7,9.</p><p>Also each hexany is a kind of complement of one of the tetrads.</p><p>For instance the 1,5,7,9 hexany uses all the vertices that have no<br/>3 factor in them, i.e. all the vertices of the dekany that aren&apos;t<br/>part of the 1*3, 3*5, 3*7, 3*9 tetrad.</p><p>So it is all fitting together now.</p><p>In the 3)5 situation is reversed - the complement of 5*9, 1*5, 1*9 is<br/>1*3*7, 3*7*9, 3*5*7, = 1, 9, 5, so otonal because of two common factors 3 and 7</p><p>- simpler than<br/>1*3*5*7*9/(5*9),... = 1/45, 1/5, 1/9</p><p>while complement of 7*5, 1*5, 3*5 is<br/>1*3*9, 3*7*9, 1*7*9 - only one common factor 9,<br/>and obviously we are just getting 1/ the ratios for the 2)5 decany,<br/>so 1/7 1/1 1/3 is simpler than 3, 21, 7.</p><p>I&apos;m assuming you get the 3)5 dekany by this complementation process<br/>by replacing 5*9 by 1*3*7, etc. in the case of the 1*3*5*7*9 decany<br/>since it works so well. Do say if that&apos;s wrong. I&apos;ll look out the<br/>Partch book you recommend,</p><p>thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2000 8:58:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robert_walker@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m assuming you get the 3)5 dekany by this complementation process<br/>&gt; by replacing 5*9 by 1*3*7, etc. in the case of the 1*3*5*7*9 decany<br/>&gt; since it works so well.
