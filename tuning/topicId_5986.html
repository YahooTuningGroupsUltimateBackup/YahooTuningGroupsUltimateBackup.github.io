An interpretation of &quot;perfectly tuned correct scales&quot; as<br/>pythagorean is just as reasonable as one with a five-limit JI, and &quot;a scale<br/>of overtones&quot; could be just such a just intonation or, in keeping with the<br/>rhythmic proportions explored in the US, an extended JI with a higher limit.</p><p>It remains true that he nowhere specifies a tuning for The Unanswered<br/>Question.</p></div><h3><a id=5988 href="#5988">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>11/6/1999 12:23:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The Charles Ives aesthetic has always been towards disonance and a 5-limit JI<br/>intonation would be contradictory.  Remember Ives references to the<br/>&quot;sissy-eared&quot;?</p><p>Perhaps love of a particular tuning implies a certain biasis for it.  This<br/>could be as extreme as to ascribe it to particular music of the past.  The<br/>AFMM is interstylistic and I am a polymicrotonalist (without perfect pitch).<br/>I only want to be honest as to the intentions of the composer.  To conceive<br/>of Charles Ives in 5-limit JI is to impose upon the wishes of the composer,<br/>and to contradict his aesthetic impulse (IMHO).</p><p>The Unanswered Question is merely a piece that supports this thesis.  5-limit<br/>JI would create more of a gel between the strings, the winds, and the<br/>soloist.  Their different and distinct tempi are further emphasized by the<br/>extended Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
