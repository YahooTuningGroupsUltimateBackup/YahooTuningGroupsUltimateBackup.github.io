Of course, they<br/>didn&apos;t have your program and only had abacuses and the like.  So I know that they are wrong<br/>compared to your data.  But I&apos;m a rationalist of the Platonic/Pythagorean tradition and there<br/>is no way that a percentage program based on a decimal system is going to convince me that the<br/>cycle of 4ths breaks down to 53 notes.  The Pythagoreans use an ogdoad or eightfold system<br/>based on a rational octave and produce a more satisfying solution to the puzzle for the<br/>rational MIND.  What this does for the ears is another thing. I&apos;m sure your program is probably<br/>more correct.  But then again, the goal of the 72 note Pythagorean scale was mastery of the<br/>pitches for MEMORY and as such the ears are not that important once the scales are learned by<br/>memory.  It&apos;s a mental/memory thing vs. physics/mathematics.  I&apos;m more of the psychotic type<br/>who likes abstractions (paranoid schizo) so I&apos;ll always say 72.  Then I&apos;m going to go out buy<br/>your books and the other authors here and read about the 53 tones.  I&apos;m mental.  Or more<br/>closely, a rationalist.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.  You may subscribe through<br/>&gt; email.

IMO, this still<br/>doesn&apos;t make it all that valuable.</p><p>No ancient who bothered to either calculate any of this math<br/>or listen to the result would have had any reason to deliberately<br/>chose a 72-tone *Pythagorean* scale.  I suggest you re-evaluate<br/>the ideas you&apos;re developing in regard to this &apos;ideal scale&apos;.</p><p>PS - Where you wrote &apos;exoteric&apos; you meant &apos;esoteric&apos;.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3>Troubledoor &#x3C;troubledoor@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/2000 7:02:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for the links and also thanks to Paul Ehrlich for the links to the 72<br/>tone folks.  It is interesting that it is mentioned that Pythagorus learned the<br/>art from Egypt because I was forced to read many Egyptian related books in my<br/>religious practices.  Eventually someone will figure out what the Lambdoma is<br/>about but you have to remember that the I Ching is virtually the same method and<br/>it was lost for 3,500 years after the passing of King Wen.  He hid it in the I<br/>Ching images but no one found it until I discovered it less than a year ago.<br/>You can go to my webpage below to see the new interpretation of the I Ching that<br/>I am hoping will aid in a holographic/HIEROGLYPHIC microtonal theory based on 16<br/>tones.  I&apos;m sure that someone will eventually reconstruct the lost (Chinese<br/>classics or &quot;wing&quot;) Book of Music.

I expect keeping the same<br/>size of octave for different numbers of notes would help as well.</p><p>&gt; I wonder if the stark contrast in the Halberstadt helped its<br/>&gt; entrenchment; I read a quote about a distasteful practice of Americans,<br/>&gt; using highly figured ivory and mother of pearl for keytops in the 19th<br/>&gt; century.</p><p>Aesthetics probably helped, but the main reason for lock-in is the time it<br/>would take to re-learn a different pattern.  Not that there&apos;s anything wrong<br/>with the Halberstadt for its intended purpose.  Nothing that some ergonomic<br/>reshaping couldn&apos;t fix, anyway.</p><p>&gt; ps.

I visit you site frequently - thanks!</p><p>On the topic of navigation of complex keyboard layouts; the paper<br/>strip concept is something I&apos;ve used for years to help me to make<br/>music on the &quot;7 white - 5 black&quot;. This was interesting to me when I<br/>saw your post - so I thought I&apos;d explain how I use this.</p><p>On my midi controller there is about a 2&quot; space above the keys, onto<br/>which I attach (with tape) a long strip of paper that covers the<br/>entire range of the keyboard. On this strip I have drawn a grid that<br/>fits perfectly in reference with the keys below. The first level of<br/>the grid shows the Cents values for the intervals, below this, and in<br/>reference to the cracks between the keys I enter the consecutive<br/>intervals (also in cents). The next level down has the ratios for<br/>each key drawn in. Below this, I have the degree of flattening or<br/>augmentation in cents. An finally at the bottom I have the pitch name<br/>entered.</p><p>This allows an immediate visual connection/orientation to what&apos;s<br/>going on with any tuning I have mapped to the keyboard - and it helps<br/>me to appreciate in a way that I can see, the subtleties of the Just<br/>Intonation mappings that I use.</p><p>The most common kind of tuning that I have used this for (which I&apos;m<br/>sure will sound exceedingly perverse to many) is when I map my 13<br/>Pitch Symmetrical Harmonic Scales to the keys. This particular<br/>approach that I&apos;m speaking of, maps 13 pitches to the octave, where<br/>there are 6 ratios counted up from the 1/1 and 6 counted downward<br/>from the 2/1, in perfect inversional symmetry. A typical scale would<br/>be: 1/1, 16/15, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, (10/7, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 16/9,<br/>15/8, 2/1). This adds on extra note per octave (2 tritones) - and the<br/>strip really helps to get about on this mapping. But this is only<br/>speaking about just one isolated octave of the total tuning/mapping -<br/>because I will very commonly have a different set of ratios mapped in<br/>every octave going up the keyboard!!! I mention this now, but fear to<br/>be banished to the microtonal wastelands for such dissonant practice<br/>(just joking). It&apos;s kind of like a harmonic series sensibility to<br/>mapping the ratios across the keyboard - where the 1/1s and 2/1s act<br/>as a sort of tonal axis. Interestingly too, is that I used to rigidly<br/>adhere to having a 4/3 and 3/2 in each octave (also for tonal<br/>grounding), while all of the other intervals where different in each<br/>successive octave, but of late I&apos;m using many other ratios that fall<br/>within 1/4 tone of 4/3 and 3/2 (to explain the logic of this<br/>construction is beyond what I care to type in this post). Usually<br/>I&apos;ll construct about 8 of these scales to cover the midi range. I can<br/>rationalize this practice in no other way than to say that I guess<br/>I&apos;m just a little (over perhaps) enamored with the harmonic series -<br/>and that it can be very interesting and beautiful (to my ears) -<br/>especially in a melodic sense - to hear a number of different timbres<br/>playing at the same time on such a tuning system.</p><p>Anyway, I think the paper strip method of keyboard navigation can be<br/>a great tool for making music with microtunings. Sometimes I wonder<br/>if my musical guests think I have some kind of &quot;big note&quot; scheme on<br/>my keyboard, because I don&apos;t know the notes. An amusing thought.</p><p>I wish everyone well today. I&apos;m off to see a performance of<br/>international artists in Carrboro, NC this evening. I&apos;ll let you know<br/>what I saw and heard.</p><p>Good Day!!!</p><p>Jacky</p></div><h3>kdoyle9162@aol.com</h3><span>8/26/2000 10:22:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Please take me off of your mailing list.<br/>Thank you.<br/>Kevin Doyle</p></div><h3>kdoyle9162@aol.com</h3><span>8/26/2000 10:22:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Please remove my name from your mailing list.<br/>Thank you.<br/>Kevin Doyle</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/26/2000 10:34:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Fri, 25 Aug 2000, Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; A thing I do with all keyboards, and it&apos;s how I originally learnt<br/>to play, is to write out the scale or chords onto a strip of paper.<br/>Then, slide that strip up and down the keyboard so that you know what<br/>to play.

To 38- or 50-equal, the white keys are excellent meantone<br/>diatonic scales, and the black keys give you 7-limit alternatives.</p><p>And wasn&apos;t it you, Joseph, who was &quot;surprised [by] the satisfactory<br/>results for 26, 27and  29&quot;?
