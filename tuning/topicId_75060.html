If I play c-f# in 1/6, I instantly hear the<br/>&gt;     beating, and when I &quot;fix&quot; it, i.e. tune it &quot;pure&quot; (beatless), I find<br/>&gt;     my ear goes to either 7/5 or 10/7, both of which sound far more<br/>&gt;     &quot;pure&quot;, though quite different in feel.</p><p>Not smoking anything.  When I hear the pure tritones of 1/6 comma on my harpsichords, played in isolation, my ear takes them apart immediately to a pure 9:8 plus a pure 5:4.

Start from C, tune a pure G to it (temporary note), tune a pure D to that (another temporary note), and then a pure 5:4 F# from the D.</p><p>The resulting C-F# rings out strongly, however pointlessly anyone may argue against it ON PAPER that 45/32 isn&apos;t &quot;meaningfully pure&quot;.  We&apos;ve all written about this before, several rounds, and on my harpsichords I continue to hear a 45/32 as pure.  Some people apparently hear things differently.  There&apos;s no need to insult me as a non-smoker or belittle my perceptions.  All three of 7/5, 10/7, and 45/32 sound pure...to me.</p><p>And once the tritone endpoints are laid down accurately, the rest of the regular 1/6 comma installation is merely a matter of fitting in 5ths that all sound similar to one another (C-G-D-A-E-B-F#, six 5ths in sequence absorbing the one syntonic comma across their span), and continuing to check all the pure 45/32 tritones as they become available.  The tritones are a nifty way to check the continued accuracy of each 5th/4th outward.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=75061 href="#75061">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Lucy &#x3C;lucy@harmonics.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2008 6:37:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Why are you all making such a meal of this dim7th thing?</p><p>From C there is no F# in a diminished; it uses Gb and Bbb</p><p>Think about it in diatonic or meantone perspective.</p><p>Forget about integer frequency ratios;<br/>they are only landmarks and about beat rates,<br/>They have little else to do with tuning, and even less with harmony ;-)</p><p>C = Tonic I<br/>Eb = bIIIrd = b3<br/>Gb = bVth = b5<br/>Bbb = bbVIIth = bb7</p><p>Each interval is a bIIIrd = b3</p><p>In 12edo bIIIrd is 3 semitones<br/>four steps of three semitones =  one octave</p><p>On Feb 15, 2008, at 1:55 PM, Brad Lehman wrote:</p><p>&gt; Tom Dent wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I could argue with equal validity that the tritone of 31-edo is an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; audibly pure 7/5 - which is much clearer to the ear than whatever<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; definition of &apos;pure tritone&apos; Brad wants to use (can 45/32 be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; meaningfully called &apos;pure&apos;?).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And Paul Poletti continued:<br/>&gt; &gt; I, too, wonder what Brad is smoking when he talks about &quot;pure&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; tritones in 1/6 mean.
