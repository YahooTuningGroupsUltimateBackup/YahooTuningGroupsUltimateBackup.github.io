It&apos;s been available to<br/>subscribers of the JustMusic list, but I don&apos;t<br/>think I&apos;ve ever made the URL public here<br/>or on my website.  And I&apos;ve just given that<br/>page a bit of an update.</p><p>For those who want to try it out, here it is:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/justmusic/introtoJM.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/justmusic/introtoJM.htm</a></p><p>(if that appears on two lines, copy and paste it<br/>into an editor, delete the line break, then copy<br/>and paste it into your browser)</p><p>Pleas note that this is an early rudimentary version,<br/>which has already been superceded.  But<br/>it is currently the most functional version<br/>available.</p><p>It can read most rational Scala files up to<br/>13-limit, and draw a Monzo lattice of the scale.<br/>Clicking on lattice points causes them to sound.<br/>Holding the shift key allows the user to play<br/>chords.</p><p>These pitches can then be mapped to the<br/>computer keyboard and played monophonically.</p><p>However, the keyboard mapping procedure uses<br/>scripts, which can assign polyphonic gestures<br/>to each key, including chords and/or several<br/>voices moving simultaneous in counterpoint.<br/>I personally have never even tried this, using only<br/>one-pitch-per-key mappings.</p><p>Then the user can record a performance on<br/>the computer keyboard, and JustMusic outputs<br/>a MIDI-file of the performance.  Of course, this<br/>can then be opened in a regular sequencer<br/>program for further editing.</p><p>More information about JustMusic is available at:<br/><a href="/justmusic">/justmusic</a></p><p>Any programmers or mathematicians seriously<br/>interested are encouraged to join the project<br/>from that webpage.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div>
