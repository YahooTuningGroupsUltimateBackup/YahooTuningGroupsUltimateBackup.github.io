This is my honest criticism. If the previously<br/>    mentioned material is divided into things, meanings and values<br/>    then the articles in the File section are &quot;things&quot; with unknown<br/>    meaning and value. If this same material is divided scientifically<br/>    into descriptions, explanations and predictions then it it is not<br/>    clear whether the data are descriptions or predictions. They are<br/>    certainly not explanations. There might be potential with this<br/>    fellow&apos;s ideas but his presentation leaves a lot to be desired. If<br/>    he presents his ideas more coherently then more people will no<br/>    doubt take up his cause if they turn out to have meaning and<br/>    value.</p></div><h3>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2008 1:14:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill Sethares already has devised a formula for consonance which proves why just intonation is an ideal tuning for whole-number multiple overtone instruments.&nbsp; Even then it&apos;s not really &quot;his&quot;, it&apos;s an equation that summarizes the curve of Plompt and Llevelt (sp.)&apos;s experiments with consonance.&nbsp; Especially if you have gotten your dissonance formula from and entirely different method I&apos;d love to know how it works.&nbsp; What a direct link to your research?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am interested to know what makes this different than his formula.&nbsp; For sure, his formula does not &quot;summarize what makes notes sound in key&quot; completely.&nbsp; But...it does seem to get a lot closer to solving the mystery, IMVHO, then the idea of &quot;limits&quot; in scales as it, unlike &quot;limits&quot;, can deal with making ideal scales for any overtone schema (not just usual odd/even overtones).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, you can play many notes in scales in his keys that don&apos;t beat or sound &quot;dissonant&quot;...but do sound &quot;out of mood&quot; for that key.&nbsp; I think this explains a lot of why tempering notes slightly up/down relative the just-intonation actually can yield more desirable moods than Just Intonation itself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For sure, we&apos;ve got a long way to go until we can define &quot;mood consonance&quot; in a mathematical way...rather than just things like eliminating beats or trying to find the perfect estimate of the critical band curve of human hearing.&nbsp;</p><p>I am VERY interested to see if any of you have any ideas on that note.</p><p>-Michael<br/>&#x9;</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/30/2008 2:06:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael Sheiman &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Bill Sethares already has devised a formula for consonance<br/>&gt; which proves why just intonation is an ideal tuning for whole-<br/>&gt; number multiple overtone instruments.</p><p>It also lets you calculate the &quot;sensory dissonance&quot; of a complex<br/>of partials.
