I suspect it would need to be within half a<br/>cent. But the point is, he is already bending for it. Surely it would<br/>be more convenient if it was closer to start with.</p><p>If you want lots of straight frets with JI, you&apos;re gonna hafta be<br/>willing to bend something. And lets face it, even the best guitars<br/>typically have intonation errors of +-3 cents anyway, so you have to<br/>bend any sustained JI harmony to really make it sing, even when the<br/>guitar is fretted for strict JI. But you don&apos;t have to put up with 5<br/>cent initial errors in the tuning either.</p><p>Folks on this list have discovered a number of linear<br/>microtemperaments suitable for use on a guitar (or Chapman stick),<br/>that have no error greater than 2.8 cents at the chosen harmonic<br/>limit. (Monz, somewhat arbitrarily, we don&apos;t call anything with an<br/>error over 2.8 cents a microtemperament). At the 7-limit, Blackjack is<br/>a MOS of such a microtemperament -- the &quot;miracle&quot; microtemperament.<br/>And miracle only goes up to 3.3 cent errors at the 11-limit (with the<br/>minimax generator, not as a subset of 72-ET).</p><p>However it does have the drawback that its generator is not a fifth or<br/>fourth so the optimum open tuning (for maximising straight frets) is<br/>very different from standard open tuning. Paul and I have designed a<br/>number of other straight-across frettings using other<br/>microtemperaments that do allow the standard open tuning to be preserved.</p><p>It appears that Robin Perry has discovered the power of the secor too.<br/>The secor being the name we&apos;ve given to the 116.7 cent generator of<br/>the &quot;miracle&quot; temperament, after its discoverer (in 1975) George Secor.</p><p>Robin has (understandably) avoided the 33 cent intervals of the strict<br/>miracle MOSs, but notice how close 70, 85 and 115 cents are to 66.7<br/>83.3 and 116.7, all of which occur in Blackjack. But I strongly<br/>suspect it&apos;s more closely related to the &quot;Byzantine&quot; planar<br/>microtemperament, which is an excellent choice when you want longer<br/>chains of fifths (more diatonicity/tetrachordality) than are provided<br/>in pure miracle. The two essentially become identical when taken out<br/>to 31 notes (Canasta). But it might be interesting to look at smaller<br/>&quot;Byzantine&quot; subsets on a guitar, such as the 19-note one derived from<br/>Rami Vitale&apos;s tuning, or others that don&apos;t have 33 cent spacing.</p><p>As for open tunings for strict JI, I don&apos;t thing there is much doubt<br/>that alternating fourths and fifths like CGCGCG gives the most<br/>straight frets, but of course it has its own problems.</p><p>Of course there are always tradeoffs that have to be decided. In<br/>addition to open tuning, intonation error and straight frets, some<br/>others are minimum fret spacing, transposability, closed cycle of<br/>fifths, tetrachordality. However, given someone&apos;s personal preferences<br/>for these things we can usually come up with a microtempered fretting<br/>that uses far fewer split frets than a strict JI fretting.</p><p>This is really a &quot;Middle way&quot;. It is not ET and it is not strict JI,<br/>but it&apos;s close enough to JI that it should only require slight<br/>variations in finger pressure to make it JI on sustained harmonies and<br/>you can&apos;t tell the difference on faster stuff.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2003 6:33:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Folks on this list have discovered a number of linear<br/>&gt; microtemperaments suitable for use on a guitar (or Chapman stick),<br/>&gt; that have no error greater than 2.8 cents at the chosen harmonic<br/>&gt; limit.
