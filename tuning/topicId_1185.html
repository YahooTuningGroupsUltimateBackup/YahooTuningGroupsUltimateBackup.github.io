Michigan, Yale, Princeton, Juilliard, Eastman,<br/>&gt; Yale . . . You pretty much get crap if you ARE complex at<br/>&gt; these places, these days...</p><p>&gt; I mean, come on.  These complaints were maybe valid 30 years<br/>&gt; ago, but not today.  (Except for maybe at San Diego . . .but<br/>&gt; that&apos;s California for you    :)   ).</p><p>It turns out that is also the view of the person who<br/>sent me the article. (I had thought he sent it to me<br/>because he agreed with Miller.)</p><p>&gt; Somebody should be writing a book about how universities have<br/>&gt; GONE SOFT and Blaaa.   Universities should be a HAVEN for the<br/>&gt; HARD-CORE: ANY hard-core,  whether it&apos;s minimalism,<br/>&gt; alternate tuning, complexity, simplicity, whatever . . . . .<br/>&gt; right now, they&apos;re just a HAVEN for THE LAME.</p><p>I guess it could be that way. What&apos;s your experience<br/>like there at Columbia?</p><p>As for myself, I greatly appreciated the fantastic<br/>music I heard at UCSD and admired the tremendous talent<br/>of the graduate students they are fortunate enough to<br/>attract. It seems like their staff, quite strong when I<br/>wont through, has gotten even better since then. I<br/>selected UCSD because I felt it had one of the best<br/>music programs around and I was not disappointed on<br/>that regard. I still consider UCSD to have the best<br/>graduate program in the Western US, though that<br/>reflects my own interests and tastes of course. However<br/>I do feel that they overwork their grad students and<br/>burn them out -- I have know many UCSD music PhDs who<br/>want nothing to do with their instrument after 8 years<br/>of psychological terror unleashed upon them.</p><p>Though I will admit that after a few years of new music<br/>concerts, it started to sound less new as I recognized<br/>a style that was constrained enough to not vary outside<br/>of certain limits.</p><p>One think I liked about Miller&apos;s proposals was that<br/>music students would be well served by having<br/>permission to write for venues such as clubs.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
