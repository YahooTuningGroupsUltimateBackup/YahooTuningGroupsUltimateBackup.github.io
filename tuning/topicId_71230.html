I often use it when trying to find out some<br/>fingerings. I first discovered this in 2003 or so. There are excellent pages<br/>on flute acoustics on that website and I&apos;ve learned a lot from them.<br/>Eventually, they also give links to Terry McGee&apos;s webpages about flute<br/>history and about Irish flutes. And these, in the end, lead me to some other<br/>flute history pages some time ago. As a result, I began interested in flute<br/>acoustics about three years ago or so -- though I&apos;m rather a keyboard<br/>player, having attended piano lessons for more than 15 years. But I love the<br/>sound of the flute and I like playing it, even though I&apos;m not a great<br/>flutist.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
