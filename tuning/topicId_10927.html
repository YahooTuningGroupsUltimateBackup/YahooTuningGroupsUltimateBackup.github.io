Any explanations<br/>&gt;and a solution would be greatly appreciated.</p><p>First of all, I believe you meant to specify &quot;x=1&quot; for all of the above<br/>formulae, correct? Now, I&apos;m under the impression that you yourself derived<br/>all or most the formulae above, and they&apos;re correct. So what you appear to<br/>be asking is, is there a pattern to the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 as a<br/>function of the fraction of a comma by which the comma is tempered? That&apos;s<br/>an interesting question, though the reason for asking it may be based on a<br/>misconception. The expressions you wrote above appear to be attempts at some<br/>sort of prime-factorization, but they aren&apos;t. The prime-factorization<br/>theorem only applies when all the exponents are integers, and, of course,<br/>the number being factored is an integer as well. For factoring non-integers,<br/>you may be interested in various analogues to the prime-factorization<br/>theorem, where certain irrationals play the role of prime numbers, depending<br/>on the &quot;field&quot; of irrationals you&apos;re seeking to factor. But even these<br/>factorizations are only unique when the exponenets are restricted to be<br/>integers.</p><p>Anyway, let&apos;s get you your general formula. The fifth itself is</p><p>2^(-1)*3^(1).</p><p>We are dividing this by a fraction (call it f) of a syntonic comma, so we<br/>are multiplying by</p><p>(80/81)^f</p><p>or</p><p>2^(4*f)*3^(-4*f)*5^f</p><p>So the answer is</p><p>2^(4*f-1)*3^(1-4*f)*5^f</p><p>There ya go, Joe!</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>We are Moving!</p><p>As of June 26, 2000, Acadian Asset Management will be at a<br/>new location in Boston&apos;s financial district.</p><p>Please contact us at:<br/>Acadian Asset Management<br/>Ten Post Office Square, 8th Floor<br/>Boston, MA  02109.</p><p>All phone, fax and email remain the same.</p></div>
