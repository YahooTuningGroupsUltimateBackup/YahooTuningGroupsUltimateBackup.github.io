I am relieved,<br/>though still sorry to have lost him.</p><p>Even had Dave said otherwise, the decision to stay or go is his and his<br/>alone.  No matter what transpires, I don&apos;t think anyone needs to feel<br/>responsible for another&apos;s decision.</p><p>I do have one recommendation for fellow listers who, like me, can get a<br/>little hot at times: write off-line, and review what you&apos;ve written at<br/>least an hour later, before sending it.  It feels GOOD to vent all that<br/>righteous anger in stirring, well-chosen words, and it feels even BETTER<br/>to be able to come back and rework before spilling all those wonderful,<br/>inflammatory words out to the world.  I&apos;ve done this many times and have<br/>been glad, and I&apos;ve failed to do this many times and have been sad.</p><p>Dave, I hope you stay with music as a passionate pursuit, that the other<br/>demands of your life don&apos;t drain it away from you.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
