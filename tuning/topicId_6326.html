Even in the west, we have a long tradition of<br/>interpretation in instrumentation, tempo, rhythm, and form. If the ability<br/>to easily change tuning during the performance of a piece had been<br/>available before now, I am sure it would have been used with the same<br/>gusto. I was moved to toss in my $.02 upon hearing the latest Kenneth<br/>Jonsson interpretations of Bach (see <a href="http://www.kenneth.nu/">http://www.kenneth.nu/</a> for the nu or<br/><a href="http://home1.swipnet.se/~w-33696/bachacro2.htm">http://home1.swipnet.se/~w-33696/bachacro2.htm</a> for the old). This is not a<br/>retuning of Bach but a retooling, dealing drastically with the rhythm,<br/>and spraying blue notes and quirky inflections. This is radical<br/>interpretation but to me it is a vital, virile Bach, and I feel we are<br/>richer for it. BTW, I have added links to Kenneth Jonsson at the<br/>bottom of my page under &quot;Other Cool Music&quot;.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
