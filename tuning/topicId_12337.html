I can&apos;t help<br/>remembering about the debate in Ancient Greece over over weather there should be a symbol for<br/>nothing (as in a zero-o). they decided against it stating that nothingness didn&apos;t need a<br/>symbol. This single act messed up western math until Fibonacci introduced the zero to the<br/>west. Don&apos;t you think placing this &apos;Bounds&quot; might have just this type of effect.
