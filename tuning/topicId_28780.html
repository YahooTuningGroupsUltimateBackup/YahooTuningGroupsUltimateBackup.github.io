In the Atlas of Tonespace the 7 limit<br/>is not mentioned as such. Instead I refer to the 7/5 plane - one face of the<br/>tetrahedral pyramid which makes up the basic cell of tonespace. When you look at<br/>the notenames on this plane you see they make up a wholetone scale which was<br/>Debussy&apos;s trademark. I think it is important therefore to observe a lower as<br/>well as an upper harmonic limit in analysing what a composer is aiming at<br/>achieving - if one has to talk about limits at all! There are many pieces by<br/>Debussy and those who came after him in which a sudden major triad would sound<br/>barbaric and out of place. I would gloss such an incongruity as a clash of<br/>planes (no puns intended)</p><p>This has been brought home to me forcibly while listening to JdL&apos;s adapted<br/>tuning MIDIfiles <a href="http://onwww.adaptune.com">onwww.adaptune.com</a> [<a href="http://www.adaptune.com/">http://www.adaptune.com/</a>]. I think most<br/>would agree that the 7limit versions of say the Romantic Sixths contains some<br/>pretty sickly sounds. One of the aims of my weighting table based program (or<br/>rather algorithms - as they haven&apos;t been coded yet) is context based interval<br/>allocation. The allocation tables make sure that the cent adjustment<br/>corresponding to the 7th harmonic is never called up unless all the notes in the<br/>chord/context happen to belong within one of the two wholetone scales. So what I<br/>would like to know is: has anybody done retuning programs which would allow me<br/>to hear if this hunch is correct?</p><p>And thanks JdL for the encouragement!</p><p>Paul Hirsh</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>try out intuitive instruments for improvisers <a href="http://onwww.ii4i.net">onwww.ii4i.net</a><br/>[<a href="http://www.ii4i.net/">http://www.ii4i.net/</a>]<br/>hear my compositions onhttp://members.scorchmusic.com/paulhirsh<br/>[<a href="http://members.scorchmusic.com/paulhirsh">http://members.scorchmusic.com/paulhirsh</a>]</p></div>
