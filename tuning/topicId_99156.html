The<br/>fundamental question at work is whether or not we&apos;d learn to hear<br/>other timbres as &quot;fused&quot; other than perfectly harmonic ones, if we&apos;d<br/>been exposed to such timbres from birth (or even while in the womb). I<br/>don&apos;t know the answer. But either way, there is clearly a difference<br/>in the way we perceive sound when listening to &quot;music&quot; vs when<br/>listening to the sounds of a city, so there&apos;s multiple levels of<br/>&quot;familiarity&quot; involved either way, and nothing stopping us from<br/>connecting one to the other short of an understanding of how to do it.</p><p>I&apos;ve also been considering that this whole process could also be more<br/>psychoacoustic cues that we haven&apos;t figured out yet. Consider: melodic<br/>motion by half step seems to have a special power in causing your<br/>intervallic perception to shift from place to place. Father<br/>temperament makes a masterful use of this, as Igs keeps pointing out.<br/>0-2-4-5-7 sounds like C-D-E-F-G, and 13-11-10-8 sounds like C-Bb-A-G,<br/>except the two G&apos;s are different. Then, if you put them together to<br/>form the scale 0-2-4-5-7-8-10-11-13, the two types of G (or fifth)<br/>start to take on their own identity, except they can still sound like<br/>two types of &quot;fifth&quot; (meaning mistuned 3/2?). You just learn how the<br/>two types of &quot;fifth&quot; relate to one another. You can use the half step<br/>cue to make these intervals function differently in different contexts<br/>as well. However, this is what makes Father -awesome-. This is part of<br/>why it rules so much. (The first time I heard porcupine, I found it<br/>woefully confusing - despite that my perception was flipping around<br/>LESS.

It&apos;s not so much that the 3rd harmonic has this powerful field of attraction, it&apos;s more that it&apos;s just really easy to trick people into hearing it where it&apos;s not present because other familiar perceptual cues bias our hearing.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well that&apos;s what I&apos;ve been suggesting as well. &quot;So strong&quot; can mean &quot;so strong&quot; by virtue of familiarity, too. That&apos;s the point of presenting two distinctly different alleged &quot;3:2&quot;s in rapid fire: if you maintain that the &quot;field of attraction&quot; of the 3:2 is due to the harmonic series, you&apos;re making a pretty dubious claim about the magic power of the third partial. Such a claim would make a mockery of the whole idea of &quot;micro&quot; tuning. 90+ cents? Come on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I no longer think that bare fields of attraction have anything to do<br/>&gt; with anything, except for babies who don&apos;t have a lifetime of learned<br/>&gt; cues that tell them in advance to look for this VF under this set of<br/>&gt; notes or whatever. Or rather, I think it&apos;s that learned cues &quot;warp&quot;<br/>&gt; the fields of attraction of each interval in a way that is dependent<br/>&gt; on musical context and makes reference to a system that I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; understand. HE doesn&apos;t model learned factors to keep it simple, and<br/>&gt; it&apos;s worked well so far, but I haven&apos;t ever used it as anything other<br/>&gt; than an interesting proof-of-concept model.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So you&apos;re saying then, if I understand you correctly, that when I hear<br/>&gt; the chord as &quot;major,&quot; I am, in fact, hearing it as a 4:5:6, but that<br/>&gt; there are learned factors that push my &quot;harmonic series detector&quot; into<br/>&gt; that configuration, and these learned factors don&apos;t just involve a<br/>&gt; Gaussian-shaped field of attraction around 4:5:6 a la HE but could<br/>&gt; include potentially anything. Right? If so, then I agree. Or, are you<br/>&gt; instead saying that this &quot;majorness&quot; I&apos;m hearing has nothing to do<br/>&gt; with the perception of 4:5:6 or otonality at all?</p><p>You hear step 7 of 17-equal as more &quot;M3&quot; than step 6, don&apos;t you? Yet step six is closer to 5/4, and like 5/4, it is not found immediately on a chain of fifths. Step 7 is a (sharp) Pythagorean ditone. But I also hear step 7 as &quot;more M3&quot; than step 6 (I generally use step 6 in my music, because I want the mellow middle third and don&apos;t want to temper out 81/80, but whatever).</p><p>Our perception of &quot;M3&quot; is a conditioned thing. Not only does it not conform, in this case, to what a harmonic-series based view says it should be, it gleefully violates that prediction. 5/4 is a piece of crap M3 if you want brilliant and striving, 81/64 garbage if you want content and sweet: &quot;M3&quot; is beholden to neither. It can be created within a broad field, but is defined by relative position, usage, context, etc.</p><p>This should be QED, for look at 12-tET. The same exact pitch can be heard as an augmented second or a minor third, depending on context. It is impossible that intervallic identity is based on frequency ratio.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And, you can easily demonstrate that 3:2 does not have a magic power. Just juggle some enharmonic tetrachords so that you have micro intervals at the 3:2 or on either side of where the 3:2 would be, and you&apos;ll find that far from making the micro intervals more difficult to discern and sing because they&apos;re drawn into 3:2, they are actually easier to distinguish and sing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But if these intervals sound like &quot;flat fifths&quot; vs &quot;sharp fifths,&quot;<br/>&gt; does this mean that we&apos;re hearing them as (perceived) 3:2&apos;s? Or are<br/>&gt; you saying there is something that &quot;fifthness&quot; is, other than an end<br/>&gt; configuration for the periodicity detector in the brain? Keep in mind<br/>&gt; - ! - that I am distinguishing between 3:2 as a reference to what the<br/>&gt; frequency ratios actually are, and 3:2 as an end perception of what<br/>&gt; you think they are.</p><p>The chords are in &quot;inversions&quot;. From e-g-c-e a fifth must be derived, and that&apos;s a learned thing. 3:2, in tune or not, just isn&apos;t jumping out at you. Two different intervals, derived not heard directly, both signally the same section of the harmonic series? That sounds so dubious. Whereas identity derived from chords and scales is right there, and obviously very flexible (otherwise we wouldn&apos;t recognize tunes when they&apos;re played out of tune).</p><p>&quot;Fifthness&quot; is &quot;So&quot;, like &quot;M3ness&quot; is &quot;Mi&quot;.</p><p>In the case of enharmonic tetrachords, try it and see.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Uh, yeah. I guess you really do get what I&apos;m saying after all. This<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hypothesis makes more sense when you consider that it&apos;s likely that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; there is no actual &quot;harmonic series detector&quot; in the brain. There is a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;periodicity&quot; detector, and it just tries to break the signal down<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; into periodic components.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would imagine that there is some kind of simplifying mechanism for pattern recognition, and one thing that makes things &quot;simple&quot; is plain old &quot;familiar&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The notion that all of this periodicity detection business is actually<br/>&gt; just a specific instance of pattern recognition has been thrown around<br/>&gt; as a serious hypothesis in the psychoacoustics literature. The<br/>&gt; fundamental question at work is whether or not we&apos;d learn to hear<br/>&gt; other timbres as &quot;fused&quot; other than perfectly harmonic ones, if we&apos;d<br/>&gt; been exposed to such timbres from birth (or even while in the womb).</p><p>Fusion must be a different issue altogether. I don&apos;t think we&apos;d ever hear as &quot;fused&quot; things that aren&apos;t fused (though obviously we can learn to hear unfused as &quot;consonant&quot;). &quot;M3&quot; obviously doesn&apos;t have anything to do with fusion, for fusion even diminishes the feeling of &quot;M3&quot; when our M3 is a ditone, as it is in 12-tET.</p><p>&gt;I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t know the answer. But either way, there is clearly a difference<br/>&gt; in the way we perceive sound when listening to &quot;music&quot; vs when<br/>&gt; listening to the sounds of a city, so there&apos;s multiple levels of<br/>&gt; &quot;familiarity&quot; involved either way, and nothing stopping us from<br/>&gt; connecting one to the other short of an understanding of how to do it.</p><p>Yes I think you&apos;re right to consider the different ways of listening. Making ambient soundscapes is completely different than making songs, for example- the audience goes right into a different frame of mind. That kind of state of mind is more ready for &quot;acoustic truths&quot; and less concerned with &quot;social truths&quot;, I have found.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve also been considering that this whole process could also be more<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic cues that we haven&apos;t figured out yet. Consider: melodic<br/>&gt; motion by half step seems to have a special power in causing your<br/>&gt; intervallic perception to shift from place to place. Father<br/>&gt; temperament makes a masterful use of this, as Igs keeps pointing out.<br/>&gt; 0-2-4-5-7 sounds like C-D-E-F-G, and 13-11-10-8 sounds like C-Bb-A-G,<br/>&gt; except the two G&apos;s are different. Then, if you put them together to<br/>&gt; form the scale 0-2-4-5-7-8-10-11-13, the two types of G (or fifth)<br/>&gt; start to take on their own identity, except they can still sound like<br/>&gt; two types of &quot;fifth&quot; (meaning mistuned 3/2?). You just learn how the<br/>&gt; two types of &quot;fifth&quot; relate to one another. You can use the half step<br/>&gt; cue to make these intervals function differently in different contexts<br/>&gt; as well. However, this is what makes Father -awesome-. This is part of<br/>&gt; why it rules so much. (The first time I heard porcupine, I found it<br/>&gt; woefully confusing - despite that my perception was flipping around<br/>&gt; LESS. So we need an explanation for why that might be.)</p><p>I&apos;ll have to check out this &quot;father&quot;.

It seems to fit the bill, though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To answer Carl&apos;s question about the progressions, here are the chords in cents in each progression except #2 (based on the original less-than-concordant tunings):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; #1:<br/>&gt; 369-1385-2400<br/>&gt; 831-1200-2215<br/>&gt; 554-1015-1846<br/>&gt; 369-646-1754<br/>&gt; 185-646-1569<br/>&gt; 369-831-1846<br/>&gt; 185-554-1200<br/>&gt; 185-646-1385<br/>&gt; 0-369-1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; #3:<br/>&gt; 1200-1575-2175<br/>&gt; 975-1650-2250<br/>&gt; 825-1200-1800<br/>&gt; 375-825-1425<br/>&gt; 600-975-1575<br/>&gt; 225-600-1200<br/>&gt; 375-825-1425<br/>&gt; 600-975-1575<br/>&gt; 0-375-1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; #4:<br/>&gt; 1200-1560-2160<br/>&gt; 960-1440-1920<br/>&gt; 840-1440-1800<br/>&gt; 840-1320-1680<br/>&gt; 720-1200-1680<br/>&gt; 480-960-1440<br/>&gt; 600-960-1560<br/>&gt; 720-1080-1680<br/>&gt; 0-720-1200<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The concordantized versions follow very similar root movements, as the retunings were actually fairly minor for the most part (especially the 16-EDO one).  Carl, I think it&apos;s pretty obvious from these that while there are some similarities, they are definitely different progressions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Probably.

In 16, 5/1 is about 12 cents flat, and 7/1 is about 6 cents sharp.  In 26, 5/1 is about 17 cents flat and 7/1 is practically Just.  38 might be best, though I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s technically Lemba.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Igs<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=99298 href="#99298">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2011 7:57:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bumping this for Carl&apos;s benefit, I know how he hates to comb.<br/>&gt;</p><p>We have Kodos in a booth backstage where he can&apos;t hear us.</p><p>I HEAR ALL!!!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=99299 href="#99299">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2011 8:24:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on some days that has to be a frightful experience.</p><p>On Thu, May 19, 2011 at 10:57 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bumping this for Carl&apos;s benefit, I know how he hates to comb.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We have Kodos in a booth backstage where he can&apos;t hear us.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I HEAR ALL!!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=99309 href="#99309">ðŸ”—</a>lobawad &#x3C;lobawad@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2011 2:37:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Thu, May 19, 2011 at 6:01 PM, lobawad &lt;lobawad@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You hear step 7 of 17-equal as more &quot;M3&quot; than step 6, don&apos;t you?

The approach you seem to have chosen is that of addressing the language of chord progressions.</p><p>&gt;Step 7 of 17-equal I hear as being<br/>&gt; more M3, yes, and 9/7 also starts to color the sound a bit. But I&apos;m<br/>&gt; asking if, after all of these factors, and all of the learned factors,<br/>&gt; and everything else, if what it is that we hear as a major third is<br/>&gt; related to some kind of skewed perception of 5/4.</p><p>I don&apos;t think that&apos;s something we can ever know for sure.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK, but what I&apos;m wondering about is whether &quot;M3&quot; actually has to do<br/>&gt; with some kind of deep psychoacoustic cue for &quot;otonal interval with a<br/>&gt; relatively strong virtual pitch &apos;presence&apos; that is two octaves down<br/>&gt; from the lowest note&quot;</p><p>I&apos;d suggest that you lose the term &quot;otonal&quot;, it&apos;s like dropping &quot;engram&quot; or &quot;e-meter&quot; into a philosophical conversation. Obviously &quot;M3&quot; doesn&apos;t have anything to do with &quot;otonal interval with a<br/>relatively strong virtual pitch &apos;presence&apos; that is two octaves down<br/>from the lowest note&quot;, as even a 9/7 works very nicely when &quot;M3&quot; is concieved of as high, bright and driving.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This should be QED, for look at 12-tET. The same exact pitch can be heard as an augmented second or a minor third, depending on context. It is impossible that intervallic identity is based on frequency ratio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I keep hearing people say this, but the fact is that we use the<br/>&gt; altered scale, which is C Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bb C, over dominant 7 chords<br/>&gt; all the time. We&apos;ve been doing that for a century now. Despite that<br/>&gt; the major third is now a &quot;diminished fourth,&quot; it still works as a<br/>&gt; dominant 7 chord. This suggests to me that this is NOT the perception<br/>&gt; of the interval flipping from an &quot;augmented second&quot; to a &quot;minor<br/>&gt; third,&quot; nor does it have anything to do with its position in the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale. In fact, we also use the diminished scale over<br/>&gt; dominant 7 chords, and the addition of this extra note doesn&apos;t seem to<br/>&gt; break anything.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Good response- it&apos;s the same counterargument I thought of when typing that. It&apos;s a good response because, although I&apos;m sure I could cook up an example in 12-tEt in which the dim4/M3 false relation is audible, I can&apos;t hear it in my head, off the top of my head. However this doesn&apos;t invalidate the easily audible difference between aug2 and m3, which every metaller making songs about Egyptian mummies rising from the tomb knows.</p><p>&gt; It suggests to me that there is something else going on, which only<br/>&gt; sometimes correlates with this &quot;augmented 2nd&quot;/&quot;major 3rd&quot;<br/>&gt; distinction, but that this distinction is not the cause of the<br/>&gt; percept.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s possible- it&apos;s easy as pie to hide the thing after all (otherwise we couldn&apos;t have such a mutable upper tetrachord in common practice music).</p><p>As far as the remainder of this post, I was thinking about it last night and I think we&apos;re getting into &quot;chicken or egg?&quot; kinds of things.</p><p>Igliashon&apos;s earlier point was essentially that if intervals we&apos;re used to really are skewed versions of some ideal, isn&apos;t it reasonable to assume that people would swoon in ecstasy when the trenchcoat of tradition is flashed open to expose the real thing au naturel? and yet we find quite a lack of swooning.</p><p>more later</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; But if these intervals sound like &quot;flat fifths&quot; vs &quot;sharp fifths,&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; does this mean that we&apos;re hearing them as (perceived) 3:2&apos;s? Or are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you saying there is something that &quot;fifthness&quot; is, other than an end<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; configuration for the periodicity detector in the brain? Keep in mind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; - ! - that I am distinguishing between 3:2 as a reference to what the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; frequency ratios actually are, and 3:2 as an end perception of what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you think they are.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The chords are in &quot;inversions&quot;. From e-g-c-e a fifth must be derived, and that&apos;s a learned thing. 3:2, in tune or not, just isn&apos;t jumping out at you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean by &quot;3:2&quot; here?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Two different intervals, derived not heard directly, both signally the same section of the harmonic series? That sounds so dubious. Whereas identity derived from chords and scales is right there, and obviously very flexible (otherwise we wouldn&apos;t recognize tunes when they&apos;re played out of tune).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was suggesting more like this whole system of cues and logic and<br/>&gt; derivation that you lay out above, derives 3/2 in both cases at the<br/>&gt; end of the day. Identity derived from scales is not &quot;right there&quot;<br/>&gt; until someone explains to me my objections about the altered scale and<br/>&gt; diminished scales above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Fifthness&quot; is &quot;So&quot;, like &quot;M3ness&quot; is &quot;Mi&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Surely you don&apos;t mean that &quot;fifthness&quot; derives from &quot;fifth position in<br/>&gt; the diatonic scale?&quot; Because the altered scale thing invalidates that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The notion that all of this periodicity detection business is actually<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; just a specific instance of pattern recognition has been thrown around<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as a serious hypothesis in the psychoacoustics literature. The<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamental question at work is whether or not we&apos;d learn to hear<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; other timbres as &quot;fused&quot; other than perfectly harmonic ones, if we&apos;d<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; been exposed to such timbres from birth (or even while in the womb).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Fusion must be a different issue altogether. I don&apos;t think we&apos;d ever hear as &quot;fused&quot; things that aren&apos;t fused (though obviously we can learn to hear unfused as &quot;consonant&quot;). &quot;M3&quot; obviously doesn&apos;t have anything to do with fusion, for fusion even diminishes the feeling of &quot;M3&quot; when our M3 is a ditone, as it is in 12-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea is that chords don&apos;t cause the fusion entirely, but sort of<br/>&gt; just imply it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll have to check out this &quot;father&quot;. So far, in temperaments, I&apos;ve found things of value (to me) in the grievously &quot;bad&quot; and in the &quot;excellent&quot;, but not much in the &quot;good&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Blackwood&apos;s 13-tet etude is where it&apos;s at.
