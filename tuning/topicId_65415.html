Common practice<br/>&gt; music generally thinks in terms of voice-leading that is based<br/>&gt; on perceiving each part as its own line.  In well done barbershop,<br/>&gt; the bass isn&apos;t meant to be heard as a distinct polyphonic part, but<br/>&gt; rather the entire quartet is heard as almost one sound.</p><p>And that is the peculiar pleasure of barbershop to me:<br/>It creates a blended sound that is a very rich timbre,<br/>in which it is exceedingly difficult to unpick the motion<br/>of the parts.  Rather than writing the four parts for<br/>maximum distinctiveness, salience or independence, as<br/>in classical polyphony, the singers create these four<br/>parts for maximum blend, union and interdependence.<br/>To find out the parts of such a mix, requires much<br/>listening, and also I think much singing and practice.<br/>To be able to create such parts, almost on the fly, as<br/>one imagines the &quot;woodshedders&quot; do, would require<br/>much more of the same.  I&apos;m impressed by both the<br/>speed with which BSers (can I say that? ;-)) must be<br/>able to put such things together, as well as the altruism<br/>of the ensemble that makes a virtuoso performance<br/>possible, as against the disharmony that often arises in<br/>small groups from an overdose of egoism (I&apos;ve been<br/>involved in such scuffles, and it ain&apos;t pretty).</p><p>[snip]</p><p>&gt; I doubt that you can find an example of a cappella common practice<br/>&gt; music that *both* has lots of 1st inversion chords and also has anything<br/>&gt; similar to the barbershop focus on harmonic blend as opposed to<br/>&gt; polyphonic melodic focus.  But if you can, I&apos;d be curious to hear it.</p><p>Now *there* is a composition challenge!!! ;-)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.375 / Virus Database: 268.2.2/280 - Release Date: 13/3/06</p></div><h3>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2006 5:37:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; And that is the peculiar pleasure of barbershop to me:<br/>&gt; It creates a blended sound that is a very rich timbre,<br/>&gt; in which it is exceedingly difficult to unpick the motion<br/>&gt; of the parts.

I believe<br/>that experiencing this expanded sound that only happens by careful<br/>cooperation and selflessness, as well as the feel and literally the<br/>&quot;harmony&quot; of these chords actually encourages people to be more<br/>happy and positive and less egotistical.  Not to say there aren&apos;t<br/>egotistical barbershoppers, but (in opposition to most collegiate a<br/>cappella) there is very little ego-stroking solo diva style singing.</p><p>I have spoken to many barbershoppers who agree with me that<br/>blending with a good quartet is truly a *spiritual* experience.  The<br/>focus is on a beauty created external to oneself.  It is more about<br/>the connection between people than about any one person.  In fact,<br/>many very listenable quartets are made of singers who would be<br/>unimpressive on their own.</p><p>It is absolutely the case in barbershop that each part learns their<br/>place and ends up caring more about the group result than their<br/>own voice.  A tip I&apos;ve heard is that when someone comes up and<br/>says &quot;great bass voice!&quot; the baritone should silently say &quot;thank<br/>you&quot; because it is the baritone&apos;s job to blend and emphasize the<br/>basses harmonics and make the bass sound good.  In the end,<br/>it is the bass structure of the quartet sound that is so good, not<br/>necessarily the bass singer.</p><p>And because each singer needs the others to create this sound,<br/>there is level of compassion between singers that I don&apos;t tend to see<br/>in other musical ensembles.</p><p>At any rate, for the tuning list issues, I do want to even further<br/>emphasize that the PERCEPTUAL implications of barbershop<br/>are truly apples and oranges compared to polyphonic style<br/>common practice music.  Even the most talented barbershop<br/>listener does not hear any part besides lead as having any of its<br/>own musical implications outside of the quartet context.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div>
