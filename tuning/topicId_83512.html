If the receiver is slightly mistuned, the frequency<br/>&gt; spectrum will be shifted. Whether anyone had the idea to use radio<br/>&gt; equipment for musical purposes is another question, but it wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; surprise me if someone did.</p></div><h3><a id=84816 href="#84816">ðŸ”—</a>whistlingelk &#x3C;whistlingelk@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2009 8:14:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve done much experimenting with alternative tuning and creating my own scales and such since 2007. I&apos;ve created songs using phi. A simple phi chord would be to use phi and inverse phi. I&apos;ve actually used phi in my binaural beats as well.</p><p>A phitave scale consists of the ratio PHI:1, 833.0902963567408 cents.<br/>An octave scale consists of the ratio 2:1, 1200.0000000000000 cents<br/>A tritave scale consists of the ratio 3:1, 1901.9550008653877 cents.<br/>A pitave (hahaha) scale consists of the ratio PI:1, 1981.7953553667823 cents.</p><p>You&apos;ve discovered the equal-tempered PHI-6 scale, except the way you explained it is difficult to follow. You&apos;ve only scratched the surface. I created a file that outputs all frequencies for all Equal-Tempered scales from PHI-2 to 3-13 haha.</p><p>But, Equal-Tempered scales aren&apos;t where you create a name for yourself. It&apos;s actually in the use of it... But more in the use of a Justly Tuned scale. Take the Bohlen-Pierce for example (3-13).</p><p>An Equal-Tempered thirteen step scale for example has zero intervals with twelve 146.3 cent steps. The BP Justly Tuned scale has thirteen steps, approximately three intervals which include 133, 169, 133, 148, 154, 147, 134, 147, 154, 148, 133, 169, 133 cent steps.</p><p>Personally, the scale sounds awful.</p><p>What you want to work with is the step beyond Justly Tuned, which I&apos;ve also created scales for ^_^. It actually gets far more complex in the next step, but far more accurate and aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>Sorry it took this long for me to reply. I would have replied in May if I knew this existed. Today I got bored and typed in PHITAVE into Google and found this. It&apos;s a term I&apos;ve used, but haven&apos;t really spread because no one really understands what I&apos;m talking about.</p><p>I&apos;ll elaborate later on the next step if you don&apos;t understand where I&apos;m going. It actually involves way more math.</p></div>
