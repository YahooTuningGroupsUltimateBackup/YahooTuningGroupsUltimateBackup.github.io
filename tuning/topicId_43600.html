We have been using Werkmeister<br/>III<br/>in the DGE for many years. I started experimenting with tunings other<br/>than<br/>equal temperament in 1969!  At that stage I was using meantone tuning<br/>and<br/>some years later moved to Werkmeister III which is more suitable for<br/>music<br/>of the middle and late baroque. There is no doubt in my mind and ear,<br/>that<br/>these are superior tunings to Equal Temperament for the reason that most<br/>of<br/>the commonly occurring thirds are fully or very nearly fully in tune. As<br/>you<br/>may know Werkmeister III was only one of many &quot;well tempered&quot; tunings<br/>and<br/>there are several major books on the subject - none of which,<br/>incidentally,<br/>I possess!!  I have one very small book by Herbert Anton Kellner<br/>entitled<br/>&quot;The Tuning of my Harpsichord&quot; published by Verlag das Musikinstrument,<br/>Frankfurt am Main, Germany, which contains directions for tuning a few<br/>historical temperaments (including Werkmeister III) and one which he<br/>somewhat eccentrically claims to have been Bach&apos;s tuning which he has<br/>&quot;reconstituted&quot;.</p><p>I wrote an article about Equal Temperament and our change over to<br/>meantone<br/>tuning in 1969 for the small magazine of the Music Association of<br/>Ireland. I<br/>attach this as a MS Word document in the hope that you may find it of<br/>some<br/>interest.</p><p>There is quite a literature on the subject and different people have<br/>differing views on which tuning is suitable for which music. There is an<br/>interesting article in the current issue of  the magazine &quot;Harpsichord &amp;<br/>fortepiano&quot; , published by Ruxbury Publications Ltd.  For information<br/>you<br/>could e-mail  Jeremy Burbidge  at: <a href="mailto:jeremy@recordermail.demon.co.uk">jeremy@recordermail.demon.co.uk</a><br/>The<br/>article is by Claudio di Veroli (who is now based in Ireland) and is<br/>about<br/>&quot;temperament ordinaire&quot;.  Claudio di Veroli runs Bray Baroque and there<br/>are<br/>a couple of links to it and to him on my Links pages.</p><p>I hope all of this is of use and interest to you. I am interested in<br/>your<br/>choral work - it sounds wonderful. I began life (!) as a singer.<br/>Choirboy in<br/>St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral in Dublin subsequently a counter-tenor in the<br/>choir<br/>there and then a Lay Vicar Choral at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin,<br/>etc., etc. And I have conducted many choirs and choral ensembles. The<br/>DGE is<br/>more or less disbanded now as I have (mild) Parkinson&apos;s which has put<br/>paid<br/>to my playing but I am still composing a little more than formerly and I<br/>have set up a publishing business, Melrose Music MM, for my own<br/>compositions, editions and arrangements initially (including much choral<br/>music) but eventually to include the work of others.</p><p>For the moment very best wishes.</p><p>Douglas.</p><p>Douglas Gunn,<br/>Melrose Music MM<br/>Early &amp; Modern Music<br/>Telephone:+353 21 464 6399<br/><a href="http://www.melrosemusic.ie">http://www.melrosemusic.ie</a></p></div>
