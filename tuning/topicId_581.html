Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@value.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/30/1999 8:53:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and some further comments about just intonation (JI)<br/>systems from various people including JI pianist Dave Hill have<br/>prompted some of the following remarks. While Dave has shown that JI<br/>can be applied to rather modern instruments and compositions such as<br/>the piano repertory, I&apos;d like to address the earlier use of<br/>JI-oriented models in composed European music.</p><p>Here it may be helpful to distinguish what I might term SIJI or &quot;small<br/>integer JI&quot; -- where _all_ significant intervals (or at least the<br/>vertical ones) can be defined as &quot;small integer&quot; ratios -- from SISJI,<br/>or &quot;small-integer-stability&quot; JI, where only _stable_ harmonic<br/>intervals necessarily have such small ratios.</p><p>Thus both medieval Pythagorean (3-limit) and Renaissance 5-limit JI<br/>schemes come within SISJI, since the most complex _stable_ intervals<br/>and combinations can be expressed with small integers, in other words<br/>an odd-limit not greater than 3 for medieval harmony (3:2, 4:3), or 5<br/>for Renaissance harmony (e.g. 5:4, 8:5).</p><p>However, neither system might be taken as strictly SIJI, since<br/>medieval harmony is replete with relative concords like 81:64 and<br/>32:27, while Renaissance harmony often features a rather bold use of<br/>the vertical tritone at 45:32, or the diminished fifth at 64:45.</p><p>Why say SISJI rather than just &quot;JI.&quot; Here my distinction is that it is<br/>quite possible to devise a &quot;JI&quot; system -- that is, all intervals defined<br/>as integer ratios -- where nevertheless there are no _small_ integer<br/>ratios. For example, a tuning based on a fifth of 16384:10935 (or a fourth<br/>of 10935:8192) very closely approximates 12-tet, as Kirnberger and others<br/>noted in the later 18th and early 19th centuries. Also, a tuning with<br/>equal semitones of 18:17 rather closely approaches 12-tet, as Vincenzo<br/>Galilei (father of the astronomer and physicist Galileo) recognized in the<br/>late 16th century. Such systems might be technically, but not in the usual<br/>musical sense, described as &quot;JI&quot; -- unlike SISJI systems such as<br/>medieval Pythagorean and Renaissance 5-based.</p><p>When it is urged that JI is mainly a theory in search of a practice, I<br/>might note that the Continental European polyphony of the era<br/>1200-1400 was very likely mostly conceived in the Pythagorean tuning<br/>described by theorists and found by modern critics such Easley<br/>Blackwood to fit the music. Although some 16th-century theorists<br/>argued that pure JI might not always describe vocal intonation in<br/>practice, nevertheless theorists such as Zarlino took it as the norm<br/>and ideal. In this view, a temperament such as 1/4-comma meantone<br/>(with its pure major thirds at 5:4) might be seen as a slight<br/>compromise of 5-based JI to accommodate the exigencies of a 12-note<br/>keyboard.</p><p>However, it bears emphasis that these great eras of JI and quasi-JI<br/>music did _not_ necessarily espouse the ideal of &quot;pure consonance&quot; as<br/>expressed by some 20th-century advocates and critics of JI systems.</p><p>Medieval polyphony of the era 1200-1400 is largely based on a subtle<br/>continuum of consonance/dissonance, while Renaissance music depends on<br/>a more subtle and muted but nevertheless vital contrast between<br/>pervasive concords and diverting dissonances such as suspensions. Even<br/>Zarlino, one of the most eloquent exponents of concord as the essence<br/>of good music, notes that dissonances (e.g. at cadences) give the<br/>music a grace it would not otherwise have.</p><p>Since the bold use of instability in medieval music has been widely<br/>recognized, and indeed the accentuated contrast between pure 3-limit<br/>concords and sometimes very tense discords (e.g. M7 at 243:128 or<br/>~1110 cents) is a feature of this music further accentuated by the<br/>tuning, I may not need to argue this point at length.</p><p>For Renaissance music, it may be worth noting that in a 5-based JI<br/>tuning of the kind described by Zarlino for vocal music, a minor<br/>seventh at 9:5 or a minor second at 16:15 is heard as a definite<br/>discord, not an incidence of &quot;pure consonance.&quot;</p><p>Thus JI can often mean &quot;an enhanced _polarization_ of concord/discord&quot;<br/>(as in the case of the Renaissance contrast between 9:5 and 5:3,<br/>vis-a-vis the possibly less pronounced contrast of 7:4 and 5:3 in<br/>7-based systems).</p><p>An almost-concluding reflection: while both medieval and Renaissance music<br/>are apparently often based on JI systems, the distinctive musical<br/>qualities of these styles may be heard even on a 12-tet synthesizer, for<br/>example; using the historically likely intonations accentuates these<br/>qualities.</p><p>Similarly, the same basic Renaissance piece might be sung in 5-based<br/>JI (or, in practice, a close approximation), played on a meantone<br/>keyboard, or indeed on a 12-tet lute (the usual tuning for this<br/>instrument, at least by 1550 or so, if we may judge from the treatises<br/>and some of the lute repertory). While these tunings -- and also<br/>Setharian considerations of timbre, such as the milder effect of a<br/>400-cent M3 on a lute -- may significantly affect the sound of the<br/>music, the basic &quot;Renaissancy&quot; character of the style remains a<br/>constant.</p><p>This is not to say that &quot;tuning is irrelevant,&quot; only that it is but<br/>_one_ parameter of music, and that &quot;JI&quot; compositions can be as<br/>different in conception and style as Perotin and Palestrina, for<br/>example.</p><p>A final note: medieval Pythagorean tuning may have the significant<br/>property among European JI systems that it is easily applied to keyboards<br/>as a consistent principle, whether in the usual 12-note tunings of the era<br/>1200-1450, or in versions of up to 17 notes, with rather free<br/>transpositions available (to speak of &quot;keys&quot; would be an anachronism,<br/>while to speak in terms of &quot;cadential transpositions&quot; might be better, a<br/>topic for another post). In contrast, implementing later JI systems (e.g.<br/>16th-century) with equal flexibility on a fixed-pitch instrument can be a<br/>somewhat daunting task, thus the popularity of &quot;quasi-just&quot; solutions such<br/>as 1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=583 href="#583">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/1999 3:33:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Excellent Margo!
