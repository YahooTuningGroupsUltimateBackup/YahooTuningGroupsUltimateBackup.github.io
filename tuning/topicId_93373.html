There&apos;s no moderators, anyone can<br/>join, etc. I&apos;ll be doing some work on triadic HE as time permits and<br/>posting it over there as well. Let&apos;s just get this mess off of the<br/>main list.</p><p>This way the folks here can talk about specific tunings and such, and<br/>all of the rapid-fire back and forth about tuning theory ancan happen<br/>over there, and so on.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
