Indeed, I shall argue that<br/>in cadential contexts, he was doing quite the opposite.</p><p>At the outset, a disclaimer is in order. When interpreting a theorist<br/>such as Marchettus, few analysts can resist being influenced by their<br/>own musical tastes and perceptions, and I certainly must admit to at<br/>least my share of such influences (sometimes called &quot;biases&quot;) in what<br/>follows.</p><p>Also, I would like to emphasize that alternative interpretations such<br/>as those of Joe Monzo are vital to the progress of medieval musicology<br/>and xenharmonic theory alike. Such interpretations may indeed lead to<br/>new paradigms, and meanwhile force all of us to reexamine and more<br/>closely scrutinize the &quot;conventional wisdom.&quot;</p><p>&gt; The first mention in European theory treatises of singers altering<br/>&gt; the pitch of Pythagorean &apos;3rds&apos; and &apos;6ths&apos;, so that they more<br/>&gt; closely approximate 5-limit JI, is in the late 1200s/early 1300s<br/>&gt; (Marchetto was one of them).</p><p>First, as Joe Monzo has also observed, it may be helpful to recognize<br/>that composed polyphony of the 13th-14th centuries does not exhaust<br/>the diversity of traditional musics practiced in the Europe of these<br/>times. I have expressed the viewpoint that various intervals and<br/>intonations, possibly reaching at least to &quot;11-limit&quot; (e.g. bagpipes<br/>with &quot;neutral thirds&quot;), may have been practiced in various regions.</p><p>Further, English music of the 13th century which has actually come<br/>down to us, as well as the statements of Theinred of Dover (13th c.?)<br/>and Walter Odington (c. 1300), show both that thirds were indeed<br/>treated as principal and even stable concords in some English styles,<br/>and that two English theorists described these intervals as being<br/>close to 5:4 and 6:5. Odington, in particular, has a passage which<br/>can be very reasonably read to suggest that singers tended to make<br/>subtle adjustments in their pitches so as to approximate these<br/>simple ratios.</p><p>However, I know of no such passages in Marchettus, and indeed his<br/>teachings seem to me rather the contrary. Note that here I translate<br/>Marchettus&apos;s terminology (with its &quot;diatonic,&quot; &quot;enharmonic,&quot; and<br/>&quot;chromatic&quot; semitones) into more familiar terms.</p><p>In his system, the usual diatonic semitone (i.e. mi-fa, e.g. e-f)<br/>seems close to the traditional Pythagorean semitone of 256:243 (~90.22<br/>cents). If we read his &quot;equal division&quot; of the tone to use five equal<br/>parts, then this normal semitone is 2/5-tone (as in 29-tone equal<br/>temperament or 29-tet), somewhat _narrower_ than the Pythagorean. If<br/>we read his division to be based on five segments built from nine<br/>equal parts (the ninefold division as in 53-tet), then this semitone<br/>is likely 4/9-tone, virtually identical to Pythagorean.</p><p>While the idea of dividing the whole-tone into _equal_ (geometric)<br/>parts is indeed radically opposed to the Pythagorean concept of<br/>integer ratios, his musical result for noncadential contexts is thus<br/>either virtually identical (the 4/9-tone interpretation), or actually<br/>a slight accentuation of the Pythagorean norm of narrow diatonic<br/>semitones and rather wide major thirds and sixths and narrow minor<br/>thirds and sixths (the 2/5-tone interpretation).</p><p>For cadential intervals (e.g. M3-5, M6-8, m3-1), as has been discussed<br/>here, his approach might be characterized as &quot;super-Pythagorean.&quot;<br/>Reading his theory literally, the leading-tone should be an<br/>ultra-narrow &quot;diesis&quot; equal to something in the neighborhood of<br/>1/5-tone or 2/9-tone. This would actually result in something<br/>not too far from 24-tet: a cadential major third of ~450 cents before<br/>a fifth, and a cadential major sixth of ~950 cents before an octave,<br/>etc. Personally, I&apos;m tempted to guess that these superwide intervals<br/>might have been tuned around 9:7 and 12:7.</p><p>In any case, the important point here is that Marchettus advocates<br/>something close to usual Pythagorean intonation for noncadential<br/>intervals, and favors the use of supernarrow cadential semitones and<br/>superwide major thirds and sixths expanding to fifths and octaves<br/>respectively. However, he says nothing of which I am aware about major<br/>thirds narrower or &quot;smoother&quot; than Pythagorean, or about 5:4 and 6:5<br/>as ratios or approximations for concords -- quite unlike Theinred of<br/>Dover or Walter Odington.</p><p>One piece of evidence which might support this more traditional<br/>reading of Marchettus -- as opposed to Joe Monzo&apos;s interpretation of a<br/>&quot;5-limit&quot; system -- is that certain theorists of the Renaissance<br/>borrowed or adapted Marchettus&apos;s &quot;fivefold division of the tone&quot; to<br/>the new musical realities of their own era. When they did so, they<br/>_reversed_ the divisions of Marchettus so that the diatonic semitone<br/>(mi-fa, e.g. e-f) was now _larger_ than the chromatic (e.g. f-f#).<br/>Rather than 2/5-tone or 4/9-tone, it was now 3/5-tone (as in 31-tet)<br/>or 5/9-tone (as with the large semitone in 53-tet).</p><p>An appealing explanation is that Marchettus was proposing a system<br/>which in cadential contexts actually exaggerated the usual Pythagorean<br/>features of narrow semitones and active thirds and sixths, while the<br/>Renaissance theorists were seeking to adapt his idea of a precise or<br/>at least approximate division of the tone into five or nine parts so<br/>that it would meet the needs of a 5-limit system (or its meantone<br/>approximation on a keyboard instrument).</p><p>As Mark Lindley has stated, Marchettus was issuing a welcome call for<br/>high leading-tones, even if other theorists quarreled with his<br/>unorthodox mathematics, or preferred the conventional Pythagorean<br/>tuning of cadences with narrow but not quite _this_ narrow semitones.<br/>However, once 5-limit intervals had in fact become an artistic ideal (as<br/>happened in the course of the first half of the 15th century in the<br/>composed music of Continental Western Europe), wider leading-tones were<br/>one inevitable consequence, as the adaptation and &quot;reversal&quot; of<br/>Marchettus&apos;s scheme shows.</p><p>Incidentally, it has recently been proposed that Marchettus&apos;s &quot;equal&quot;<br/>division of the tone actually refers to an _arithmetic_ division, as<br/>when a monochord has a whole-tone ratio of 81:72 (9:8) divided into<br/>nine intermediate segments. If this was indeed the intended meaning,<br/>then Marchettus was widely misunderstood by Prosdocimus (also at<br/>Padua, about a century later) and various others.</p><p>The idea of an equal _arithmetic_ division of the tone would hardly be<br/>described as &quot;impossible&quot; by Pythagorean theorists: both Boethius and<br/>Jacobus of Liege give the arithmetic division of the tone into 18:17:16<br/>as an example showing that such a division produces _unequal_ ratios,<br/>not a (geometrically) equal division (in fact impossible, quite unlike<br/>this type of arithmetic division, if we use only integer ratios).</p><p>However, if we do choose to adopt such an &quot;arithmetic&quot; reading, then<br/>an interpretation of 81:77 for the diatonic semitone (~87.68 cents)<br/>would again give a quite close approximation to Pythagorean, and in<br/>fact be slightly narrower than Pythagorean (and thus associated with<br/>slightly _wider_ major thirds and sixths, etc.).</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@value</p></div>
