I know maybe some of the Sims players won&apos;t<br/>like that, but I&apos;m not entirely enamored of the Sims symbols for<br/>quartertones.</p><p>Now, oddly, the &quot;downers&quot; seem to work somewhat differently, at least<br/>on *my* sound card.  The quartertone flats are assigned B0, 80 *as<br/>well as* the quartertone sharps.  That&apos;s *not* the way it&apos;s supposed<br/>to work according to the manual!  According to the manual it would be<br/>a *lower* number, 48...</p><p>Anyway, I was finding that in order to get the *smaller* microtonal<br/>divisions one actually had to *ADD* to the quartertone number, in<br/>order for it to work right, so I have been getting the following on<br/>the &quot;down&quot; side:</p><p>normal = B0, 64</p><p>v = BO, 95.9</p><p>&lt; = BO, 90.6</p><p>[ = BO, 80</p><p>Well, that sounds right to *me* anyway, and the numbers can be edited<br/>right on the screen once they have been created using the default<br/>quartertone plugin....</p><p>jp</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2002 12:06:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>Looks like you are making good progress on the Sibelius stuff (I&apos;m only scanning the posts quickly) - good for you!
