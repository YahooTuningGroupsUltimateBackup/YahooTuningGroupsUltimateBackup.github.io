I&apos;m playing this Monday (July 14) at Bard College in upstate NY.<br/>I&apos;ll be playing on some of the instruments I&apos;ve created, in a scale<br/>that divides two octaves into 15 equal intervals (160 cents each).<br/>Most people I&apos;ve encountered who work with non-12-tet scales/tunings<br/>are doing synth or computer based stuff. Anyone else here into the<br/>old school way of making sounds by vibrating objects? (not to imply<br/>there&apos;s anything wrong with synths or computers).</p><p>Paul<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/ubertar">www.geocities.com/ubertar</a></p></div><h3>X. J.

I knew a guy in Seattle when I<br/>lived on the left coast who built his own quasi gamelan instruments-<br/>Mike Edwards. We studied the Javanese stuff under Jarrad Powell and<br/>Maria Omo of Gamelan Pacifica.<br/>I think now I&apos;m only going to do one piece in that 160 cent scale- it<br/>sounds really good on my m&apos;birangi (sort of an elongated electric<br/>m&apos;bira, played with four fingers (no thumbs)) but not so great on<br/>strings. Aside from that, I&apos;ll do a free jazz Sun Ra Coltrane freak<br/>out thing on one of the new instruments (a nine soon-to-be ten string<br/>bowed/plucked electric tube, related to my ubertar). Do you record<br/>your goats and chickens?</p><p>Paul</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:crazy_music@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;X. J.
