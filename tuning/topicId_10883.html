It&apos;s that little annoying<br/>program that comes with some operating systems and all it does is make<br/>little blobs multiply on a square grid apparently randomly, but they&apos;re<br/>always really working on some sort of rule. I was thinking, what if you let<br/>them do that on a lattice? Take a 3-5 lattice, for instance, and set up a<br/>game of Conway&apos;s Life on it, with different rules reminiscent of cadences,<br/>where whenever a cell occupied a square that pitch would sound. Oscilators<br/>would make pedals or rythmic patterns in the same meter as their period (a<br/>period-3 oscilator would do something in 3/4 time), gliders would modulate<br/>endlessly, and spacefillers would form gigantic, increasingly dissonant<br/>tonal structures. The generations would tap out the beat. I&apos;ll set to work<br/>on it straight away.</p><p>    &quot;The air was full of music. So full it seemed there was room for nothing<br/>else. And so each particle of air seemed to have its own music , so that as<br/>Richard moved his head he heard a new and different music, though the new<br/>and different music fitted quite perfectly with the music that lay beside it<br/>in the air.<br/>    &quot;The modulations from one to another were perfectly<br/>accomplished&iuml;&iquest;&half;astonishing leaps to distant keys made efforetlessly in the<br/>mere shifting of the head. New themes, new strands of melody , all perfectly<br/>and astoundingly proportioned , constantly involved themselves into the<br/>continuing web. Huge slow waves of movement, faster dances that thrilled<br/>through them, tiny scintillating scampers that danced on the dances, long<br/>tangled tunes whose ends were so like their beginnings that they twisted<br/>around upon themselves, turned inside out, upside down, and then rushed off<br/>again on the back of yet anopthger dancing melody in a distant part of the<br/>ship...<br/>    &quot;He knew he had been listening to the music of life itself...&quot;<br/>&iuml;&iquest;&half; Dirk Gently&apos;s Holistic Detective Agency, Douglas Adams</p><p>Stay Tuned,<br/>    Keenan P.</p></div>
