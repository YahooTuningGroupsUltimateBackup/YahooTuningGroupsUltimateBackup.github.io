If temperament can<br/>make puns by fixing scale degrees to frequencies and changing their<br/>rational interpretation, maybe JI can make puns by fixing scale degrees to<br/>rational interpretations and changing their frequencies -- maybe, as Wilson<br/>has been saying for years, commatic shifts can be anything but a problem!</p><p>John, my enthusiasm for your project may be apparent.  But let me say that<br/>hearing works like the Bach and Beethovan, which are so important to me<br/>emotionally, performed with the power of intricate tuning has had a<br/>profound spiritual impact on me.</p><p>Even the 5-limit Bach, which would benefit the least (or suffer the most,<br/>depending on how you feel about my first paragraph) from commatic shifts is<br/>clearly better for the richer color and greater consonance of JI -- the<br/>reduction of beating over the tempered version is immediatley audible.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=6316 href="#6316">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/19/1999 9:26:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Carl Lumma, TD 401.7:]<br/>&gt; But let me say that<br/>&gt; hearing works like the Bach and Beethoven, which are so important to<br/>&gt; me emotionally, performed with the power of intricate tuning has had a<br/>&gt; profound spiritual impact on me.</p><p>Super!
