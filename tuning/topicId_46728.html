That&apos;s for ets.<br/>It should have been to possible to remap all note numbers received to other numbers (e.g. in fifths for easy switching between meantones), or to assign them to constants (the format is centlike: the pitch of the twelve tone note number plus two decimal places - if c is 64.00, %/4 E is 67.86, and more decimal places are possible and should be truthfully computed). I never did that, because an array 128 such mapping modules a) take a lot of work and screen space and b) would have taxed my litte p2 233 box too much.</p><p>hope it helps,</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3><a id=46742 href="#46742">ðŸ”—</a>klaus schmirler &#x3C;KSchmir@z.zgs.de&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/2003 4:36:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>klaus schmirler wrote:</p><p>&gt; It should have been to possible to remap all note numbers received to &gt; other numbers (e.g. in fifths for easy switching between meantones), &gt; or to assign them to constants (the format is centlike: the pitch of &gt; the twelve tone note number plus two decimal places - if c is 64.00, &gt; %/4 E is 67.86, and more decimal places are possible and should be &gt; truthfully computed).
