And if this<br/>(Reinhard&apos;s realization) still sounds, to my ears and my sensibilities<br/>anyway, very much like an incomplete work - i.e., a rough draft (and<br/>here this calls the most attention to itself by way of static or<br/>monochromatic stretches somewhat similar to say the Browning or the<br/>St. Gaudens), I was genuinely stunned by how much material there was<br/>to work from... and this is especially pertinent in lieu of Johnny&apos;s<br/>often voiced concern (here at the TD) of trying to do what he does<br/>with others work with a minimal amount of editing... Johnny&apos;s<br/>realization (at an hour plus) both dwarfs the Austin realization<br/>(which primarily seemed to me to focus in on the clustered and<br/>multilayered possibilities of the percussion or rhythmic &apos;algorithm&apos;)<br/>and brings into serious question the conventional narrative that has a<br/>fascinating but in the end woefully slight half-collection of drafts<br/>and plans comprising the Universe... This would really seem to be a<br/>misleading scenario that has passed and perpetuated undeterred through<br/>a variety of sources over the years, and I really have a great deal of<br/>respect for Johnny for walking right through this, and presenting this<br/>sizable a work with what I&apos;m assuming is an absolute minimum of<br/>editorial &apos;finishing.&apos;</p><p>In short, Ives seems to be in good (AND GET THE DAMN JOB DONE!) hands<br/>with Johnny Reinhard... and for whatever they&apos;re worth, my<br/>congratulations on a big job well done.</p><p>Dan</p><p>PS - I&apos;m also very happy to say that I personally found the pitch<br/>sensitive reading here to indeed be a chief attraction of this<br/>realization, and well worth whatever &apos;the price of admission&apos; is in<br/>and of itself...</p><p>_____________<br/>{1} In an off-list discussion with Joseph Pehrson about the Austin and<br/>Reinhard realizations of the Universe Symphony, Joe wrote, &quot;...the<br/>overall sound of the piece is not &quot;candy-coated&quot; like the Austin. He<br/>stays away from all that light mallet percussion that makes the Austin<br/>so particularly &quot;un-Ivesian...&quot; And I&apos;d have to agree that that seems<br/>to be a good characterization of part of what makes the overall<br/>texture of Austin&apos;s Universe realization so wrongish sounding (similar<br/>I believe to bits of William Schuman&apos;s orchestration of Ives&apos;<br/>Variations on &quot;America,&quot; where the &quot;light mallet percussion&quot; also<br/>imparts a decided sense of wrongishness; almost like Ives reflected<br/>back through the light of a Coplandesque Americana...).</p></div><h3><a id=7345 href="#7345">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/29/1999 5:38:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 12/28/99 11:43:09 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:stearns@capecod.net">stearns@capecod.net</a> writes:</p><p>&lt;&lt; the obstinate tolling of a<br/> single bell note (F#, if I&apos;m remembering correctly?), and some *very*<br/> univesian trills in the xylophones or marimbas{1} --  &gt;&gt;</p><p>Dan, there is a low bell that is asked for that &quot;tolls&quot; every 16 seconds, the<br/>pitch is not specified.
