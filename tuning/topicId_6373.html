This is referring to actual<br/>&gt;attempts to map melodies to lattices and noticing that<br/>&gt;it is non-intuitive.</p><p>You&apos;re absolutely right, it&apos;s &quot;just the nature of melody vs harmony&quot;. To me<br/>a scale must be analyzed in four ways. (1) its harmonic lattice<br/>configuration, including any possible &quot;bridges&quot;; (2) its melodic structure,<br/>putting the notes in order of pitch; (3) how the relations in (1) are<br/>expressed as a function of the structure in (2); (4) whether all these<br/>elements can conspire to create the conditions for a stable tonic and hence<br/>tonality. In (2), I enjoy noting similarities in the arrangement of steps at<br/>fourths or fifths. The most common scales in the world have 5 or 7 notes,<br/>and usually have some similarity within a lower fourth and an upper fourth<br/>in the octave (sometimes you find non-octave repeating scales with three or<br/>more similar fourths or fifths in a row). My decatonic theories hinge on the<br/>ability to increase the number of steps per octave from 5 or 7 to 10 while<br/>preserving the important &quot;diatonic&quot; characteristics according to (1), (2),<br/>(3), and (4).</p><p>P.S. Don&apos;t discount the importance of the whole range of sizes of &quot;seconds&quot;<br/>in the world&apos;s melodies. Major and minor seconds are just the two we&apos;re most<br/>familiar with.</p></div>
