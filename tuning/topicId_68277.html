I barely recognize the tuning from what everybody is saying about it, and I&apos;ve been composing and recording in it for almost 18 years. To really understand any tuning, one needs to have hands on experience with it, I feel...write some pieces, not just one or two little tuning studies...but get to know a tuning from living with it, playing it, and HEARING what it sounds like in various situations. Heck, look at all the incredibly diverse applications of 12 eq over the years...country, classical, flamenco, jazz, blues, whatever. I&apos;ve found 19 to be a lot of fun, and I&apos;m sure there are things I&apos;ll be discovering for years to come. I guess the thing is that I approach tunings from a musicians perspective, not a theoretical one...and yes, the line is vague at times, as I too like the theory behind tunings, and have started creating my own on the fretless guitar.<br/>   But, you cannot understand a tuning system from paper, I don&apos;t care how intelligent someone is...and most folks here are certainly smart folks. Retune a keyboard, refret a guitar, and take a few years (or more) to actually live with a tuning...then you might be able to talk about it from real life experience, namely the compositions you&apos;ve created...that, in the long run, is why I am into non 12 tunings in the first place. And after all these years, I&apos;m just getting started...even with 19...best....HHH<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2006 11:15:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     It&apos;s a hoot to watch the theoretical discussion and<br/>descriptions of 19 eq and it&apos;s properties by folks who haven&apos;t really<br/>dug in and composed with it.

Have you<br/>tried organizing 19 by negri, hanson and magic as well as meantone? If<br/>so, what people are saying should make sense in terms of your own<br/>experience.</p><p>&gt; To really understand any tuning, one needs to have hands on<br/>experience with it, I feel...write some pieces, not just one or two<br/>little tuning studies...but get to know a tuning from living with it,<br/>playing it, and HEARING what it sounds like in various situations.</p><p>There&apos;s a lot of truth in what you say--but a lot of untruth also.<br/>Experience is limited to what one has experienced; if you don&apos;t take<br/>the trouble to experience different ways of using 19, you won&apos;t know<br/>about them, whether you use it for 18 years or 80.</p><p>&gt; Heck, look at all the incredibly diverse applications of 12 eq over<br/>&gt; the years...country, classical, flamenco, jazz, blues, whatever.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s kind of my point. If all you do with 12 is use it as a<br/>meantone tuning, you end up never using it as an octatonic scale<br/>tuning, and end up thinking you understand 12-et completly when you<br/>don&apos;t. That&apos;s like using it for classical but not jazz in a way.</p><p>&gt;    But, you cannot understand a tuning system from paper, I don&apos;t<br/>care how intelligent someone is...and most folks here are certainly<br/>smart folks.</p><p>I&apos;ve worked with more tuning systems than just about anyone on this<br/>list, and the *first* thing I always do, before writing a note or<br/>listening to a scale, is try to understand it on paper. People do have<br/>different ways of working and composing.</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2006 4:11:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a hoot to watch ...</p><p>Isn&apos;t it, though?
