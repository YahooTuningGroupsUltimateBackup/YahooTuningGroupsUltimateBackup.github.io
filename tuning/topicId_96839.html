I also got that he changes the scale<br/>midway through the melody at the end so that the Ev becomes an Ebv,<br/>which ends up being about 7/4. It looks like the actual maqam rast<br/>would use a normal Eb on the way down, not an Ebv, so I can only<br/>assume that he flattened it for stylistic reasons to get it closer to<br/>7/4.</p><p>I&apos;m a bit synesthetic, and F to me is generally yellow.

I didn&apos;t know it was in English now.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 4) They are obviously not really playing in 24-equal, as<br/>&gt; &gt; that 950 cent interval is always played sharp enough to<br/>&gt; &gt; sound like 7/4. Has some regular &quot;maqam temperament&quot; ever<br/>&gt; &gt; been proposed that would explain it? Something in which a<br/>&gt; &gt; lot of the maqamat are MOS, and others are near-MOS or<br/>&gt; &gt; MODMOS or whatever it&apos;s called?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again, see Ozan Yarman, and the controversies around him.<br/>&gt; If there&apos;s a more precise pattern to tuning across the maqam<br/>&gt; world, it&apos;s a subtle one that many cloth-eared theorists are<br/>&gt; oblivious to.</p><p>I have, uh, some obvious reservations that a 79-note MOS is really<br/>what&apos;s going on at the heart of all of this.</p><p>But I&apos;ll try the obvious approach and let&apos;s see where it leads me.<br/>From the limited supply of maqam music I have heard, it seems that<br/>they often split the minor third into two equal 3/4 step intervals.<br/>I&apos;ll take the liberty of mapping that to an approximate 10:11:12<br/>trichord, meaning that 121/120 kicks the bucket. They often also split<br/>the major third into two equal whole steps, which I&apos;ll assume makes<br/>sense to map to 8:9:10, so 81/80 vanishes. Then you also have the fact<br/>that two neutral thirds equals a perfect fifth, and if we assume the<br/>neutral thirds are 11/9, that means that 243/242 disappears. This was<br/>covered anyway by the first two commas. So now we&apos;re approaching<br/>Mohajira temperament.</p><p>The melody for the Bashir piece I posted above is F Ev D C D Eb D C...<br/>however, as I said before, the Eb is flattened a bit so that it sounds<br/>like 7/4. So from a mapping standpoint, that would mean that 64/63<br/>vanishes as well. So the intervals that have vanished here are<br/>121/120, 81/80, and 64/63. This gives us the following<br/>Mohajira-meets-Dominant temperament, what you call Vicentino++:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7_17&error=11.488&limit=11&invariant=2_8_-4_5_1_1_0_4_2">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7_17&error=11.488&limit=11&invariant=2_8_-4_5_1_1_0_4_2</a></p><p>Or perhaps Bashir really did mean to play Ebv, such that F-Ebv maps to<br/>7/4. There are two ways to temper here that seem obvious - eliminating<br/>176/175, meaning that 9 generators down gets you to 7/4, or 56/55,<br/>meaning that 15 generators up gets you to 7/4. Here&apos;s the 176/175<br/>temperament, called &quot;Semififths:&quot;</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=31_7&error=8.480&limit=11&invariant=2_8_-11_5_1_1_0_6_2">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=31_7&error=8.480&limit=11&invariant=2_8_-11_5_1_1_0_6_2</a></p><p>Here&apos;s the 56/55 temperament, also called &quot;Vicentino++&quot;.</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7_17&error=16.495&limit=11&invariant=2_8_13_5_1_1_0_-1_2">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=7_17&error=16.495&limit=11&invariant=2_8_13_5_1_1_0_-1_2</a></p><p>Now, furthermore, let&apos;s assume that Oud players don&apos;t actually stick<br/>to this as a regular temperament, but that they microtune things here<br/>and there as they see fit, artistically, as do string players for<br/>western music. Alright, so we have adaptive JI based off of this going<br/>on then, same as western music.</p><p>Anyway, that&apos;s my initial half-assed analysis. What facets of maqam<br/>performance contradict the above? The 7-limit is pretty sloppy the way<br/>I did it, but it seems like 121/120 and 81/80 vanishing are pretty<br/>fundamental features of this music.</p><p>&gt; &gt; At one point I thought that maqam music may be related<br/>&gt; &gt; somehow to porcupine in that the two evoke similar<br/>&gt; &gt; feelings for me, but since they clearly distinguish<br/>&gt; &gt; between the minor and neutral third, it can&apos;t be that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nothing so simple, I&apos;m afraid. But if it inspires you to<br/>&gt; make music in Porcupine, go for it!</p><p>There are times I swear I have heard players straighten out that Rast<br/>tetrachord so that it sounds like 4 equal divisions of 4/3, which<br/>would be porcupine. I also heard at one point in this clip it sound<br/>like they were straightening out another line such that something like<br/>Negri was produced. Carl thinks its closer to 24-et. He&apos;s probably<br/>right, but I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if improvisational musicians on a<br/>fretless instrument weren&apos;t tempted to do stuff like that once in a<br/>while.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2011 1:24:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at 2:25 AM, Graham Breed<br/>&gt; &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>[Gu Qin]<br/>&gt; Can you link me to any good stuff to check out?

From the limited supply of maqam music I have<br/>&gt; heard, it seems that they often split the minor third<br/>&gt; into two equal 3/4 step intervals. I&apos;ll take the liberty<br/>&gt; of mapping that to an approximate 10:11:12 trichord,<br/>&gt; meaning that 121/120 kicks the bucket. They often also<br/>&gt; split the major third into two equal whole steps, which<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll assume makes sense to map to 8:9:10, so 81/80<br/>&gt; vanishes.

Assuming that this<br/>picture is right and I haven&apos;t made an error, there could be two ways<br/>to think of this:</p><p>1) You could think of C-Bb approximating both 16/9 and 7/4, but with<br/>some adaptive retuning going on.<br/>2) Or, you could think of the difference between 16/9 and 7/4 as a<br/>significant enough interval that it deserves to go into the coarse<br/>structure and not the fine structure.

It means that 36/35 doesn&apos;t vanish,<br/>and that players consciously use this interval to hit 7-limit<br/>intervals when they want. If you believe that they generally just<br/>think in terms of a single diesis, such that 45/44 (the difference<br/>between 11/9 and 5/4) and 36/35 get smushed together into a single<br/>&quot;diesis&quot; sized interval, that means 176/175 vanishes. This is mohajira<br/>temperament. This assumes that the temperament doesn&apos;t reflect the<br/>notation, such that this diesis is notated in one case (between a<br/>neutral third and a major third), and that it isn&apos;t in another case<br/>(between the minor seventh and 7/4).</p><p>It also leads to the scenario that these two dieses are different, and<br/>you get the 11-limit 81/80 and 121/120 planar temperament.</p><p>This is the line of inquiry that I was curious to explore, and this<br/>massive 71-note MOS doesn&apos;t really have anything to do with that.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2011 4:34:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m more interested, again, in figuring out what some linear<br/>&gt; temperaments are that support maqam music.

The blind man describing an elephant approach<br/>isn&apos;t working here.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d like some evidence to back this up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Would you now! I&apos;d like some evidence to back up anything<br/>&gt; you&apos;re suggesting, or even a plausible argument.</p><p>Sure. First off, you&apos;d normally be right to suggest that the burden of<br/>proof is on me when I claim that previously sounded notes can bias the<br/>periodicity processing of currently sounded ones. However, in this<br/>case, there are only two options: that they do, and that they don&apos;t.<br/>This means that in this case, to play devil&apos;s advocate for science<br/>against one model actually implies certain things from the other<br/>model, and these are probably testable by experiment. To assume that<br/>no periodicity processing takes place for melodic intervals isn&apos;t just<br/>skepticism about the hypothesis that it does; it&apos;s actually a new<br/>hypothesis that implies tangible predictions, and I find those<br/>outlandish. Until one of us devises an experiment to test these, both<br/>models are on equally shaky footing.</p><p>I&apos;d be happy enough to leave it at that and didn&apos;t even think to bring<br/>up the issue at all. However, you are now asserting your model as a<br/>reason for why I can&apos;t say that 1050 cents can be mapped to 11/6. Your<br/>main point is that 11/6 doesn&apos;t produce a clear fundamental. To which<br/>I&apos;d say that 9/7 doesn&apos;t produce the proper fundamental in 27-tet&apos;s<br/>diatonic scale either. In this case, 11/6 is a simple interval around<br/>the size of 1050 cents, so I chose to map it to that. You could also<br/>map any interval of around the same size to 1050 and any of those<br/>would be a decent mapping. 11/6 is the simplest one and so I&apos;d assume<br/>it takes precedence.</p><p>Furthermore about your actual model - you think that psychoacoustics<br/>determines the quality of a chord when the notes are played in unison,<br/>as per our infamous debate a half a year ago about mavila. However,<br/>you think that when these notes aren&apos;t played in unison, the same<br/>psychoacoustic factors no longer play a role. This means that a<br/>separate mechanism would have to be responsible for C-Eb-G sounding<br/>sad when arpeggiated vs when it&apos;s played together.</p><p>The following are the things that you have to believe if you&apos;re not<br/>willing to believe that the same mechanism is responsible for both:</p><p>- There are two mechanisms at play here, but the two mechanisms yield<br/>pretty much identical results, since C-Eb-G sounds sad both if it&apos;s<br/>arpeggiated or if played simultaneously. But they&apos;re apparently still<br/>two separate mechanisms.<br/>- It&apos;s impossible to play on an organ with only drawbars 1 and 3, and<br/>slowly drop the 1 out such that the lone drawbar remaining still<br/>sounds like 3/1, so all of the organ players who have noticed this<br/>don&apos;t exist. This is because previously sounded notes don&apos;t influence<br/>the periodicity analysis of the current note.<br/>- No periodicity processing isn&apos;t occurring in this video,<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngoE1hreStc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngoE1hreStc</a>, except for with each<br/>individual note taken in isolation.</p><p>These are all of the things that you&apos;re forced to believe when you<br/>don&apos;t go with the simpler, more obvious model, which is that the two<br/>mechanisms are actually just one mechanism. This means that<br/>arpeggiated minor chords sound sad for the same reason that minor<br/>chords played together sound sad.</p><p>Furthermore, you are now attempting to place restrictions on me from<br/>your model, which seems in my view less likely than the alternative.<br/>Why should I believe any of this just because you&apos;re unconvinced that<br/>previously sounded notes bias the auditory processing of currently<br/>sounded notes? Just &quot;being unconvinced&quot; doesn&apos;t mean anything if there<br/>are only two options.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You also have no problem in mapping 700 cents to 3/2,<br/>&gt; &gt; but you do have a problem in mapping 400 cents to 5/4.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d like to know why 3 gets special treatment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where did I &quot;map&quot; 700 cents to 3/2?</p><p>You &quot;mapped&quot; 700 cents to 3/2 and 500 cents to 4/3 when you said that<br/>maqam music was in 24-tet and also that 3/2 and 4/3 are involved<br/>because of tetrachordal symmetry.</p><p>&gt; I assume they tune, for instance, the open strings as nearly<br/>&gt; to 3/2 as they care to, and no more nearly to anything else.<br/>&gt; The scales are tetrachordal, which certainly suggests a role<br/>&gt; for 3:2.

So, I set out to find<br/>a middle of the road fantasy that is both simple and accurate.<br/>Something ideally between rank-whatever RI and rank-1 24-ET would be<br/>great. And so far I&apos;ve thrown out a few simple rank-3 and rank-2 ideas<br/>just to get feedback on them.</p><p>Why, by your discussions with Carl, I&apos;d expect you to be positively<br/>enthralled! Except this is your response.</p><p>&gt; What is the purpose of finding linear temperaments that support this music? What is important is the approximate melodic sizes of the intervals, not the ratios they approximate. Trying to bring linear temperaments into this seems nonsensical unless there&apos;s evidence that certain maqam melodies would in fact incur a comma pump in certain situations.</p><p>And so on and so on and so on. Does that apply to 24-ET too? Is 24-ET<br/>only a valid fantasy if there&apos;s evidence that certain maqam melodies<br/>would incur some 24-ET based comma pump? I sure hope not. How about<br/>the 79-note MOS? Do we need to see some comma pump need to get thrown<br/>in there too?</p><p>So what the frig? Are you basically just playing devil&apos;s advocate<br/>here? Why would you take two opposite positions right in the middle of<br/>the same public thread? And then there&apos;s also this:</p><p>&gt; However, as there&apos;s no evidence that any maqam intervals are meant to &quot;approximate&quot; anything, it seems like any ET with fine-enough step-sizes could approximate maqam music well enough. 24-ET seems to be the lower-limit of pitch resolution necessary, but I bet you could use 25-EDO just as well, or 26, or 27...etc.</p><p>You think that 26-tet is applicable for maqam music?

LOL</p><p>I presented myself as a student here and came up with a cursory and<br/>naive analysis of what I was hearing. I admitted at the time that it<br/>was just a half-assed first guess that I threw out to open up a<br/>dialogue with the people on here whom I know have been studying it for<br/>a long time and get some feedback. I assumed that there would be<br/>additional complexities that would confound my initial exposition, and<br/>threw it out there to get some feedback on what those complexities<br/>might be. So first off, for you to tell me that any of that is<br/>&quot;arrogant&quot; is absurd. I couldn&apos;t have been more humble in my language<br/>and I&apos;m not going to try. This is like Cameron comparing me to Hitler<br/>for saying that 9/7 is sometimes perceived as a mistuned 5/4.</p><p>The kind of feedback I was looking for was something like &quot;yes, but<br/>this interval you tempered out isn&apos;t really tempered in practice&quot; or<br/>&quot;yes, but as you can see here in this piece they tend to vary from<br/>that structure&quot; or something like that. And if those were the types of<br/>claims being made, I&apos;d have no problem shutting the hell up and<br/>soaking it all in, especially if data&apos;s being provided to back that<br/>up. But instead, the claim was made that regular temperament is an<br/>invalid procedure to apply at all here, because periodicity processing<br/>in the usual sense doesn&apos;t apply to monophonic music. This lifts the<br/>discussion out of the realm of cultural aesthetic and places it<br/>squarely within the physical realm of psychoacoustics, which I have no<br/>problem discussing for hours on end.</p><p>Carl has said that he&apos;s the only one who&apos;s got data on this so far<br/>and, despite my arguments over psychoacoustics with him, he is<br/>correct. If the Tartini data shows no evidence of negri retempering in<br/>that phrase, I&apos;ll drop it, because I don&apos;t care - I just want to learn<br/>the truth. To say that all of this is invalid because I&apos;m a Western<br/>listener who hasn&apos;t been trained in maqam music is absurd. When people<br/>on here make sweeping generalizations about jazz I don&apos;t claim that<br/>they&apos;re arrogant racist orientalists for not having been formally<br/>trained in jazz theory for four years. I just correct them when<br/>possible and move on, because I aim to be respectful. You should try<br/>that sometime.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 3) It has to do with actually making maqam music in that all of the<br/>&gt; &gt; scales used are near-MOS&apos;s of the 7-note 3L4s MOS, and I thought that<br/>&gt; &gt; starting here would be a good way to understand near-MOS&apos;s and how<br/>&gt; &gt; they work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First you said you want to use regular mapping to understand maqam music. Now you say you want to use maqam music to understand near-MOS&apos;s. Which is it?</p><p>All of it. The entire overlapping line of research is what I want to<br/>explore. The claim has been made that most scales used in the world<br/>are MOS&apos;s, and in this case most scales used in maqam music are<br/>near-MOS&apos;s of 3L4s.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 4) We have largely limited our exploration of scales to MOS&apos;s, and I<br/>&gt; &gt; use near-MOS&apos;s all the time in 12-tet music, and I thought they&apos;d be<br/>&gt; &gt; useful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How does the regular mapping paradigm produce near-MOS&apos;s?</p><p>The regular mapping paradigm produces Fokker periodicity blocks, which<br/>are related to MOS&apos;s, which can be altered to produce near-MOS&apos;s.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 6) I also wanted to do it because I didn&apos;t think that the 24-tet<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;coarse&quot; structure was accurate enough, but that the 79-note MOS was<br/>&gt; &gt; too accurate to count as a coarse structure to begin with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Accurate enough for whom?</p><p>Accurate enough for my ears, which are telling me that 7/4 and 7/6 are<br/>getting used all over the place, meaning that maqam practitioners are<br/>dynamically retuning notes on the fly. I hope you&apos;re not going to<br/>dispute that now.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 10) If you don&apos;t want to map this system because you think that<br/>&gt; &gt; periodicity doesn&apos;t count here, please provide evidence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Currently there is no evidence in favor of either side. We are dealing with unknowns here and playing &quot;hot potato&quot; with the burden of proof is ridiculous.</p><p>I have done my best to provide some preliminary evidence for my<br/>paradigm with a few simple listening tests that you can do yourself,<br/>some anecdotal evidence, and most recently proposed a more rigorous<br/>mTurk listening test to settle the matter. I don&apos;t have any scientific<br/>studies to show you because I doubt it&apos;s ever been tested.</p><p>The indirect support that I have for this hypothesis is that there is<br/>very clear evidence showing that psychoacoustic factors cause<br/>different chords to sound &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;sad,&quot; e.g. chord quality is<br/>somewhat related to periodicity processing (reference my previous<br/>conversation with Carl on &quot;tonalness&quot; for more about that, or check<br/>out the &quot;Semitonal JI Chords&quot; thread I posted for listening examples).<br/>This evidence is again not shown in an N=1000 size study, but is the<br/>best we have. It applies to chords that have all notes played<br/>simultaneously. In other words, minor sounds &quot;sad&quot; because of<br/>psychoacoustic factors, and I think that the evidence for this is<br/>pretty promising, although maybe you aren&apos;t sold. Carl at least agrees<br/>with this so far, so if you disagree with even this then we&apos;re now at<br/>a third, separate discussion.</p><p>Assuming you buy the whole low tonalness low roughness bit, then go<br/>and try a simple listening test: go arpeggiate C minor, and then go<br/>arpeggiate C major. Which sounds &quot;happy?&quot; Which sounds &quot;sad?&quot; Now<br/>arpeggiate C diminished. Would you trust people to rate the<br/>discordance of an arpeggiated C diminished as being more discordant<br/>than an arpeggiated C major? Because I don&apos;t think that it makes a god<br/>damned difference if you arpeggiate it or not.</p><p>Furthermore, anyone who&apos;s ever played organ has probably noticed that<br/>if you play something with drawbars containing only partials 1 and 3,<br/>and slowly drop the 1 out while continue to focus on the phantom 1,<br/>that your brain can sometimes still hear the lone partial remaining as<br/>still being the 3 of a 1 that&apos;s not even being played anymore. That<br/>is, the previous timbre is now biasing the perception of the current<br/>timbre. This is more evidence to show that periodicity processing can<br/>be biased by previously heard stimuli, and you can test this yourself,<br/>although it takes a bit of mental fortitude to actually snap your<br/>perception into that mode.</p><p>This is the best evidence that I have, but I think that it&apos;s just as<br/>valid as the listening tests about tonalness when the notes are played<br/>together. Furthermore, if you now want to raise the goalpost such that<br/>anything we talk about has to be proven in an overarching study with<br/>statistical measures taken into account and such, then none of this<br/>has ever been proven at all, and not even HE has been subjected to<br/>that kind of rigor. But it is my attempt to explain why I think this.</p><p>Another piece of evidence is that if periodicity processing has<br/>nothing to do with melodic contours, then it&apos;s more likely that two<br/>separate mechanisms cause minor chords to sound sad when played<br/>together vs played separately, despite that these &quot;two mechanisms&quot;<br/>yield identical results in every case I&apos;ve ever found. So Occam&apos;s<br/>razor would suggest not just inventing a separate mechanism producing<br/>identical results when one will do.</p><p>Anyway, that&apos;s the best &quot;proof&quot; I can offer, and that should be enough<br/>to get a discussion started. The response I&apos;ve gotten for why there<br/>should be two mechanisms involved is either that minor chords actually<br/>don&apos;t sound sad when arpeggiated (which is a claim I&apos;m sure my<br/>proposed listening test will destroy), or that it&apos;s &quot;just unlikely&quot;<br/>that auditory processing is influenced by the memory of previous<br/>stimuli with no explanation of why it should be unlikely. Actually, it<br/>seems rather &quot;likely&quot; to me. Having given at least an initial outline<br/>of my reasoning, I think that I deserve an explanation of why my logic<br/>is &quot;just unlikely&quot; at this point.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; 415 cents is a type of major third.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What&apos;s the size of the major second then? How would you put Rast in 26-tet?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 0-230-369-507-693-923-1062-1200.</p><p>So now the fifth between D and A is huge. And this doesn&apos;t sound like<br/>Rast at all to me. But we can conclusively prove this in the listening<br/>test. But furthermore:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think this would work out to you needing two different sizes of<br/>&gt; &gt; minor second then.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How so? And either way, what&apos;s the problem?</p><p>How the hell is this any better than what I&apos;m doing? You&apos;re just<br/>making up your own structure here, but saying that things don&apos;t matter<br/>that I believe do matter. How is this more pure than my approach? You<br/>also currently know jack s*** about maqam music, and yet you are<br/>boldly trying to explain and categorize it according to regular<br/>mapping. How can you explain and describe something that is still<br/>largely outside of your experience and understanding?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
