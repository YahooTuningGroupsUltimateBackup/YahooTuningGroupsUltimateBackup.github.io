And perhaps lift from our<br/>conversation.</p><p>It seems that composers &quot;theorize&quot; that players can&apos;t do specific microtones,<br/>but they can.  It was Messiaen that published that there are two things wrong<br/>with writing microtonal music; first, you need new instruments and second,<br/>you would have a trainwreck with notation.  He was misinformed.</p><p>Composers have gone through a computer-influenced position of taking things<br/>out of the players&apos; hands.  Players, left to their own devices, responded by<br/>learning to improvise, by developing extended techniques (like circular<br/>breathing and double-tonguing).  Jazz did more with microtones and<br/>multiphonics than other musicians, but it is more locked into 12TET in theory<br/>than many other styles of music.</p><p>Players have pushed the envelope more than composers it seems.  People like<br/>Robert Dick (flute), Heinz Holliger (oboe), and yours truly have put the two<br/>together as a responsibility.  Our instruments have capabilities beyond the<br/>imagination of the composers.  And now that there are fingering charts for so<br/>many different tunings, published and on the Internet, there is a different<br/>situation now.</p><p>Woodwind players can play in any tuning.  It&apos;s even easier than on string<br/>instruments (especially at first) because there is a distinct and unique<br/>fingering for each microtone (and here I mean any pitch that is not part of<br/>the &quot;idealized&quot; 12TET).  Though embouchure (the mouth placement on the reed<br/>or mouthpiece) pitch is indeed flexible.  However, the fingers do as much<br/>possible.  Bassoon has more keys, open tone holes, a 3.5 octave range, and a<br/>rich harmonic content than the other winds and may actually have a greater<br/>natural advantage than the others.  Also, there are some problem spots, but<br/>they are negotiable by the experienced.</p><p>The early days meant listening to horrid electronic tones on Korg chromatic<br/>tuners, much to the distress of our neighbors.  For hours and days and weeks<br/>and years, we found our microtones.  Now, we just play them.  When composers<br/>write for them, players are ready.  Of course, there will always be people<br/>with attitude.  You can navigate around them.</p><p>The notation in a &quot;prescriptive&quot; sense is very important to the players.  I<br/>have been training microtonal players for two decades now and have realized<br/>for some time that a single notation that allows for the polymicrotonality of<br/>a multitude of tuning possibilities is easily achieved.</p><p>For those who haven&apos;t heard this before, using a basic notation that includes<br/>a quartertone sharp and flat, exact deviations of 1-49 cents can be indicated<br/>above each notehead.  Keep in mind that players may need to write specific<br/>idiosyncratic fingerings for each tone.  Advanced players do not need to<br/>write in quartertones any longer.  There is no 12TET inherent in this<br/>notation.  It is only an achievable method for measuring 1200TET.  For this<br/>reason, I also do not believe 48TET eighthtones are necessarily 12TETish.<br/>There are too many pitches available for one to be strapped in to the<br/>conventional grid.</p><p>Bring on the new music!</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
