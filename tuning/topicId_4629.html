One might want to approximate an irrational interval with a ratio<br/>at a certain prime or odd limit, even if there are closer approximations<br/>with a higher limit. CF&apos;s will probably work, but the Brun algorithm is<br/>easier (for me, at least) and shows the semiconvergents as well. I&apos;ve<br/>programmed it and can evaluate each convergent and semiconvergent that<br/>appear and can select whichever ratio I want.</p><p>I&apos;ve programmed CF&apos;s too and sometimes use them</p><p>As for brute force, that works well too and I&apos;ve programmed versions of<br/>it as well.</p><p>All these methods have their uses and it&apos;s sometimes fun to watch<br/>various solutions emerge on the screen.</p><p>--John</p></div>
