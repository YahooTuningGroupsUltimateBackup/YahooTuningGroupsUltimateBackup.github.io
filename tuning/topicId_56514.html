Dear monzo has made a page about one<br/>  &gt; the tetrachords in segah played by maestro ebadi &mldr;.<br/>  &gt; It is in 17-edo.</p><p>  Mohajeri is referring to this webpage:</p><p>  <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?iranian-segah-mode.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?iranian-segah-mode.htm</a></p><p>  &gt; We know that 17 is related to 34,51,&mldr;.. and 51 is near<br/>  &gt; to <a href="http://53.so">53.so</a> we may assum that there is a spectrum of edo&apos;s<br/>  &gt; with 53 in center:<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; &mldr;&mldr;. , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56&mldr;&mldr;.</p><p>  there is some truth to what you say here, in that,<br/>  by the point where there are that many divisions of<br/>  the &quot;octave&quot;, the differences in step-size are so small<br/>  that it is not very noticeable (particularly on traditional<br/>  persian instruments, which are not accurately tuned in these<br/>  temperaments ... forgive me if i&apos;m wrong about this, in my<br/>  ignorance of persian music and theory).  i.e, the<br/>  step-sizes of the temparaments you list here are:</p><p>  ET ... step-size in cents</p><p>  50 ... 24<br/>  51 ... 23.52941176<br/>  52 ... 23.07692308<br/>  53 ... 22.64150943<br/>  54 ... 22.22222222<br/>  55 ... 21.81818182<br/>  56 ... 21.42857143</p><p>  the difference is much more noticeable for the<br/>  lower-cardinality ETs, for example:</p><p>  ET ... step-size in cents</p><p>  10 ... 120<br/>  11 ... 109.0909091<br/>  12 ... 100<br/>  13 ... 92.30769231</p><p>  however, it should also be noted that different ETs<br/>  approximate JI in different ways.</p><p>  note that on my webpage, i point out that both 17-edo<br/>  and 24-edo give decent approximations to the cents-values<br/>  which you measured from Maestro Ebadi&apos;s performance.</p><p>  this is because both of these temperaments give a<br/>  good approximation to both the pythagorean intervals<br/>  *and* the (approximate) quarter-tones.</p><p>  often, 53-edo is also admitted into this company<br/>  (that is, tuning families which contain 17- and 24-edo),<br/>  because it gives a *superb* approximation to pythagorean<br/>  tuning. see, for example, the patterns of error-from-JI<br/>  under the family of tunings in which the &quot;skhisma&quot;<br/>  vanishes, on the colored applet graphic here:</p><p>  <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?bingo.htm&applet">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/index2.htm?bingo.htm&applet</a></p><p>  in the case of Maestro Ebadi&apos;s pentachord, 53-edo<br/>  *does* give a decent approximation to the _koron_<br/>  (which Mohajeri measured at 356 cents) -- which<br/>  is 16 degrees of 53-edo, or in precise mathematics,<br/>  2^(16/53) = ~362.2641509 cents.</p><p>  however, 53-edo fails to map the 2nd degree of Maestro<br/>  Ebadi&apos;s pentachord (which Mohajeri measured at 215 cents),<br/>  which falls almost exactly between 9 and 10 degrees of<br/>  53-edo.</p><p>  thus, while 53-edo does usually resemble both 17-edo<br/>  and 24-edo in many ways, in this particular case it<br/>  fails to give a representation of Maestro Ebadi&apos;s<br/>  performance which is as good as either of them.</p><p>  i think that what you (Mohajeri), Ozan, and Can Akkoc<br/>  are doing with interval-spectrum theory is very interesting.</p><p>  -monz</p><p>  You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>  of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.</p><p>  You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>  of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>    <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.</p><p>        Yahoo!
