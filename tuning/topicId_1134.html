Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com">PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com</a>&gt;</p><p>Carl, I just meant I didn&apos;t think that {whatever characteristics of the<br/>ear and brain make us latch on to simple integer ratios} will be<br/>selected for to such an extent that future humans will be able to pin<br/>down fractions like 634/501 in music. I already stated in the same<br/>discussion that it&apos;s easy to hear the difference between 400 cents and a<br/>just 5/4.&lt;</p><p>I&apos;ll go Erlich one further on this. In all likelihood, given the present<br/>aoustical environment, ability to listen over a wide frequency range is not<br/>going to be a favored trait for selection.</p><p>I recently went for an ear exam. My Doctor is a 75 year-old semi-retired<br/>HNO specialist.  He went on at great length about the decline of hearing<br/>during his lifetime, with machinery and amplification the largest factors<br/>in the decline.  He also noted that he felt it was fortunate for his<br/>patients that they spoke German, or, in my case, English, languages which<br/>were phonological more sturdy under losses of higher frequencies.  Whether<br/>composers in the future will compose within a more limited frequency range<br/>to accomodate a unversally reduced hearing, or continue to compose to those<br/>in full posession of their vestigial ten octaves is an interesting, if sad,<br/>question.</p></div>
