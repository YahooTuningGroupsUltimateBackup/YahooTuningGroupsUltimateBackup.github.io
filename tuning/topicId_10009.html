Chords in 13-tet are a real problem as no<br/>intervals in 13-tet are very consonant. One solution is to use a<br/>computer (PC or MAC) and run Csound and make up timbres consisting only<br/>of octave-extended 13-tet intervals (a 13-tet tempered harmonic series).<br/>This will make the intervals much more consonant.  Bill Sethares does<br/>this in the CD accompanying his book, Timbre, Tuning, Spectrum, Scale.</p><p>Thirteen-tet, IMO, is a melodic, not harmonic tuning.</p><p>In XH13, I discussed some chords in 13-tet, but my harmonic language<br/>would sound rather harsh and atonal. Paul Rapoport suggested another<br/>approach based on a 10-tone subset of 13-tet in the same issue. Warren<br/>Burt also discussed the tuning in the same issue.</p><p>Good luck.</p><p>--John</p></div>
