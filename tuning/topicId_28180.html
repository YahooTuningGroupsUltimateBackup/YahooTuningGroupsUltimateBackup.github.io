It would<br/>start with passages highlighting E and B, followed by passages with<br/>accent and emphasis on  C and D, with the finale stressing F and G.</p><p>More directly, does any work exist which uses all natural notes<br/>except A?  I cannot recall any such raga that uses only those notes.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
