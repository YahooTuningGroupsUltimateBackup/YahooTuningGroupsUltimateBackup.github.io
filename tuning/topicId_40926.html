Pehrson</p><p>riding the motorcycle isn&apos;t a hobby for me -- i drive<br/>about 300 miles a week teaching my lessons, and since<br/>every day includes traveling in afternoon rush-hour<br/>traffic, and California allows &quot;lane-splitting&quot; (a<br/>motorcycle can share a lane with a car, thus enabling<br/>a motoryclist to travel freely in between stopped cars<br/>on the freeway), using my motorcycle has been a huge<br/>improvement in my job driving situation over using the car.<br/>the motorcycle also represents a considerable savings<br/>on gas. (and finally, it&apos;s a lot more fun!)</p><p>the bike&apos;s being disabled due to the accident is going<br/>to make getting back to work much more of an ordeal now.<br/>(and the weather here for the past few days has been<br/>fantastic too ...)</p><p>-monz</p></div>
