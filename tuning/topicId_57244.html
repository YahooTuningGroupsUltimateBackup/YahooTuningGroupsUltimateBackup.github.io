So, if I understand you correctly, it is only with the concern of equating 5:4 to 81:64 that many meantone temperaments are derived? Is that why it is the syntonic comma (5:4 / 81:64) that is tempered here?</p><p>I keep ending up with a lot of JI intervals in maqam music. For example, this it the latest Huzzam scale I cooked up:</p><p>1/1<br/>13/12<br/>39/32<br/>4/3 (33/25 when descending)<br/>3/2<br/>13/8<br/>17/9<br/>2/1</p><p>C Dd Eb F G Ab B C</p><p>Alterations that are part of this maqam allow for this interlude:</p><p>1/1<br/>13/12<br/>39/32<br/>351/256<br/>13/9<br/>13/8<br/>117/64<br/>243/128</p><p>C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb Cb (play descending)</p><p>As for the Ptolemy commas that come into play in the Rast tetrachord:</p><p>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; 1/1<br/>  &gt; 9/8<br/>  &gt; 27/22<br/>  &gt; 4/3<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Play it like this, and you have a Usshaq genre:<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; 4/3 27/22 9/8 1/1 9/8<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; If I were to temper the 4000:3993 kleisma that results from<br/>  &gt;comparing 27:22 to a whole tone minus two Ptolemy commas, I figure<br/>  &gt;that would somewhat justify the inclination of Zalzal Wusta to the<br/>  &gt;whole tone ratios as demonstrated above.</p><p>I only assumed that subtracting two (5-limit) Ptolemy commas from 9/8 is a more &grave;just&grave; way of reaching 27/22 (which is an 11-limit ratio). Am I stretching the definition of temperament here? Is not temperament a slight adjustment of basic JI intervals to represent more complex JI intervals with the same ratio? Ah, but now I see that 88209/80000 is as complex in its prime content as 27/22. So I guess it is not permissable to temper one of these.</p><p>But I don&apos;t understand how you obtain the generators here:</p><p>  If you start with 11-limit Just Intonation, which is 5-dimensional<br/>  {2,3,5,7,11}, and temper out 4000:3993, you end up with a 4-<br/>  dimensional temperament which (in one optimized form) can be<br/>  constructed from these four generators, in cents: g1=1200., g2=-<br/>  165.9852708, g3=2785.912380, g4=3368.915093.</p><p>  Prime 2 is being approximated, trivially, by the g1, 1200 cents.</p><p>  Prime 3 is approximated by 2*g1 + 3*g2: 2*1200 - 3*165.9852708 =<br/>  1902.0441876 cents.</p><p>  Prime 5 is approximated by g3, 2785.912380 cents.</p><p>  Prime 7 is approximated by the g4, 3368.915093 cents. In fact you can<br/>  leave this generator out altogether, and have a 3-dimensional system,<br/>  if you&apos;re only interested in {2,3,5,11}-JI and its temperaments.</p><p>  Prime 11 is approximated by g1 - g2 + g3: 1200 + 165.9852708 +<br/>  2785.912380 = 4151.8976508 cents.</p><p>  Other optimizations will lead to slightly different values for these<br/>  four generators. But the key point to notice is that no matter how<br/>  you choose the generators, the representation of 4000:3993 will<br/>  vanish. Why? 4000 is 2*2*2*2*2*5*5*5, or 2^5 * 5^3. So in terms of<br/>  the generators above, it will be</p><p>  5*g1 + 3*g3</p><p>  Do you follow?</p><p>Almost... but the generators? Is prime 2, 2:1? and prime 3, 3:1 and prime 5, 5:1? If so, I begin to understand. The math is most entertaining... temperament seems to be a lot of fun. But how do you correlate 2^5 with 5*g1 and 5^3 with 3*g3? In the lattice diagram?</p><p>  Meanwhile, 3993 is 3*11*11*11, or 3^1 * 11^3. So in terms of the<br/>  generators above, it will be</p><p>  2*g1 + 3*g2 + 3*(g1 - g2 + g3)<br/>  = 2*g1 + 3*g2 + 3*g1 - 3*g2 + 3*g3<br/>  = 5*g1 + 3*g3.</p><p>  Still following?</p><p>Ah, almost... almost... But please elucidate the correlations for me.</p><p>  Thus 4000 amounts to the same thing as 3993 in any tuning system that approximates the primes in this way. So 4000:3993 would be<br/>  represented by 5*g1 + 3*g3 - (5*g1 + 3*g3) = 0; i.e., it vanishes.</p><p>Spledid! So, this is what is called tempering out 4000:3993. Are there other equations such as this for tempering out the same interval?</p><p>  The only other ratios that vanish in such a system are powers of<br/>  4000:3993 -- 16000000:15944049, 64000000000:63664587657,<br/>  256000000000000:254212698514401, etc. No other ratios vanish in this system.</p><p>Marvelous. So, is there a scala file I can obtain or can you show me how to prepare one for experimenting on this?</p><p>  If you don&apos;t mind that other ratios vanish as well as 4000:3993 and<br/>  its powers, here are some other temperaments of 11-limit JI:</p><p>  3-dimensional:<br/>  () 540:539 /\ 4000:3993 (generators 600, 433.9278373, 2785.854450<br/>  cents)</p><p>  2-dimensional:<br/>  () Wizard (generators 600, ~217 cents)<br/>  () Octoid (generators 150, ~16 cents)<br/>  () 385:384 /\ 2401:2400 /\ 4000:3993 (generators 1200, ~583 cents)<br/>  () 225:224 /\ 385:384 /\ 4000:3993 (generators 600, ~383.2 cents)<br/>  () 243:242 /\ 385:384 /\ 4000:3993 (generators 1200, ~516.68 cents)<br/>  () 225:224 /\ 243:242 /\ 4000:3993 (generators 1200, ~516.69 cents)</p><p>  1-dimensional:<br/>  () 72-tone equal temperament<br/>  () 311-tone equal temperament</p><p>Ah! So, 72-tone equal temperament tempers out 4000:3993 along with some other commas?</p><p>  I stole most of this information from Gene&apos;s posts on tuning-math;<br/>  any errors are of course my fault.</p><p>Don&apos;t say that... say you borrowed. I&apos;m sure there will be no penalty for that. ;)</p><p>  Let&apos;s verify that 4000:3993 vanishes in 72-tone equal temperament. In<br/>  72-tone equal temperament, prime 2 is approximated by 72 steps, prime<br/>  3 is approximated by 114 steps, prime 5 is appproximated by 167<br/>  steps, (prime 7 is approximated by 202 steps,) and prime 11 is<br/>  approximated by 249 steps.</p><p>Yes, I follow you.</p><p>  So 4000, or 2^5 * 5^3, will be represented<br/>  by 5*72 + 3*167 = 861 steps, while 3993, or 3^1 * 11^3, will be<br/>  represented by 114 + 3*249 = 861 steps. Hence 4000:3993 will be<br/>  represented by 0 steps, hence vanish, in 72-equal.</p><p>Ah, I get it! So, the numerator of 4000:3993 is prime two times five * prime five times three. Since prime 2 of 72tET is the 72nd step and prime 3 the 167th, you say 4000 is 360 (five octaves) + 501 (three octave-fifths) = 861 steps. The same analogy applies to the denumerator, and hence, the same number of steps, with the difference being 0, resulting in 4000:3993 to vanish.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div><h3><a id=57249 href="#57249">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2005 11:42:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I only assumed that subtracting two (5-limit) Ptolemy commas from<br/>9/8 is a more &grave;just&grave; way of reaching 27/22 (which is an 11-limit<br/>ratio). Am I stretching the definition of temperament here?</p><p>No, you can temper anything you like. However, 27/22 is an interval of<br/>12/11 above 9/8, so I don&apos;t know what you mean by subtraction. The<br/>Ptolemy comma is a 3-limit comma, 3^12/2^19, so I also don&apos;t know what<br/>you are subtracting, or adding.</p><p>Is not temperament a slight adjustment of basic JI intervals to<br/>represent more complex JI intervals with the same ratio? Ah, but now I<br/>see that 88209/80000 is as complex in its prime content as 27/22. So I<br/>guess it is not permissable to temper one of these.</p><p>You can temper either one or both, but you need to decide what they<br/>will be made equivalent to. For instance, a logical way to temper<br/>27/22 would be to equate it to 11/9, which would mean tempering out<br/>243/242. A logical way to temper 88209/80000 would be to equate it to<br/>11/10, which requires tempering out 8019/8000. You can certainly do<br/>both together, tempering out 4000/3993 and 243/242 both; one good<br/>means of doing that is using 72-equal. 72-et tempers out 441/440 as<br/>well, and you can get a linear temperament by adding this to 243/242<br/>and 4000/3993, or you can get a planar temperament by simply tempering<br/>out those two.</p><p>&gt; Almost... but the generators? Is prime 2, 2:1? and prime 3, 3:1 and<br/>prime 5, 5:1? If so, I begin to understand. The math is most<br/>entertaining... temperament seems to be a lot of fun. But how do you<br/>correlate 2^5 with 5*g1 and 5^3 with 3*g3? In the lattice diagram?</p><p>The generators have been given by Paul in logatrithmic form, in cents.<br/>1200 cents is exactly 2, but 1902.0441876 cents is 3.000155 and<br/>2785.912380 cents is 4.998841. Hence instead of 5^3 we would tune to<br/>(4.998841)^3, and so forth.</p></div><h3><a id=57250 href="#57250">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/2005 12:20:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think I begin to understand basic math operations in music<br/>&gt;theory Paul.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like the way you decribe temperament.

So in terms<br/>of<br/>&gt;   the generators above, it will be<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   5*g1 + 3*g3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Do you follow?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Almost... but the generators?</p><p>It takes a little algebra to find the generators, which is why I<br/>copied them from Gene&apos;s post :) But as you can see, I verified that<br/>these generators do satisfy the condition that 4000:3993 be tempered<br/>out . . . and it seems, from the below, that you may now understand<br/>this verification -- but let me know if I need to clarify further.</p><p>&gt;Is prime 2, 2:1? and prime 3, 3:1 and prime 5, 5:1?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt;If so, I begin &gt;to understand. The math is most entertaining...<br/>&gt;temperament seems &gt;to be a lot of fun. But how do you correlate 2^5<br/>&gt;with 5*g1 and 5^3 &gt;with 3*g3?</p><p>The generators are given in cents, which is a logarithm-of-ratio<br/>measure of interval size. A basic property of logarithms is that</p><p>log(a^b) = b*log(a)</p><p>So if we say that g1=1200 cents represents prime 2 = 2:1, then<br/>2*g1=2400 cents represents 2^2 = 4:1, 3*g1=3600 cents represents 2^3<br/>= 8:1, 4*g1=4800 cents represents 2^4 = 16:1, and 5*g1=6000 cents<br/>represents 2^5 = 32:1, etc. And if g3=2786 cents represents prime 5<br/>= 5:1, then 2*g1=5572 cents represents 5^2 = 25:1, and 3*g1=8358<br/>cents represents 5^3 = 125:1.</p><p>Making sense?</p><p>&gt;   Thus 4000 amounts to the same thing as 3993 in any tuning system<br/>&gt;that approximates the primes in this way. So 4000:3993 would be<br/>&gt;   represented by 5*g1 + 3*g3 - (5*g1 + 3*g3) = 0; i.e., it<br/>&gt;vanishes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Spledid! So, this is what is called tempering out 4000:3993. Are<br/>&gt;there other equations such as this for tempering out the same<br/>&gt;interval?</p><p>I don&apos;t really understand the question, but maybe the below answered<br/>it . . .</p><p>&gt;   The only other ratios that vanish in such a system are powers of<br/>&gt;   4000:3993 -- 16000000:15944049, 64000000000:63664587657,<br/>&gt;   256000000000000:254212698514401, etc. No other ratios vanish in<br/>this system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marvelous. So, is there a scala file I can obtain or can you show<br/>&gt;me how to prepare one for experimenting on this?</p><p>You&apos;ll have to wait until after the weekend, when I return to the<br/>office, where I have my software . . . then I&apos;ll be able to propose<br/>some reasonable scales that are constructed from these generators.<br/>Unless Gene or someone beats me too it, which I hope they will!</p><p>BTW, how do you feel about tempered octaves? If you approve of them,<br/>I might use the TOP temperament of 4000:3993 alone, whose<br/>approximations to the primes can be calculated with the formulas in<br/>the paper I sent you.</p><p>&gt; Ah! So, 72-tone equal temperament tempers out 4000:3993 along with<br/>&gt;some other commas?</p><p>Yup! For example, 225:224, 385:384, and 2401:2400.</p><p>&gt;   Let&apos;s verify that 4000:3993 vanishes in 72-tone equal<br/>temperament. In<br/>&gt;   72-tone equal temperament, prime 2 is approximated by 72 steps,<br/>prime<br/>&gt;   3 is approximated by 114 steps, prime 5 is appproximated by 167<br/>&gt;   steps, (prime 7 is approximated by 202 steps,) and prime 11 is<br/>&gt;   approximated by 249 steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I follow you.</p><p>This is no different than the first case I mentioned above, except<br/>that here there&apos;s only one generator: 1/72 octave.</p><p>&gt;   So 4000, or 2^5 * 5^3, will be represented<br/>&gt;   by 5*72 + 3*167 = 861 steps, while 3993, or 3^1 * 11^3, will be<br/>&gt;   represented by 114 + 3*249 = 861 steps. Hence 4000:3993 will be<br/>&gt;   represented by 0 steps, hence vanish, in 72-equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, I get it! So, the numerator of 4000:3993 is prime two times<br/>&gt;five * prime five times three. Since prime 2 of 72tET is the 72nd<br/>&gt;step and prime 3 the 167th, you say 4000 is 360 (five octaves) +<br/>&gt;501 (three octave-fifths) = 861 steps. The same analogy applies to<br/>&gt;the denumerator, and hence, the same number of steps, with the<br/>&gt;difference being 0, resulting in 4000:3993 to vanish.</p><p>Hopefully the first case above is now equally clear to you. Let me<br/>know if it isn&apos;t.

So, the first dimension is<br/>&gt;the octave with 2:1 which will remain untouched for my purposes, and<br/>&gt;the second dimension is the tempered perfect fifth with the ratio<br/>&gt;3:2 and the third dimension is the tempered pure third with the<br/>&gt;ratio 5:4.</p><p>I thought you said 2 dimensions?</p><p>&gt; Prime factorizing 81:80 gives me<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3*3*3*3 (3^4) for the numerator<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2*2*2*2*5 (2^4 * 5^1) for the denumerator.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, will you help me figure out the rest?</p><p>You seem to have left out some of your reasoning above.

Don&apos;t use that? Then for N-chain, do something<br/>&gt; like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, scale all the intervals by multiplying them by N so that the<br/>&gt; period becomes an octave. Then, design a keyboard for the resulting<br/>&gt; tuning, with the &quot;aspect ratio&quot; deliberately chosen to be N times<br/>too<br/>&gt; wide. Finally, scale the horizontal axis by 1/N, and apply the<br/>&gt; original temperament to the keyboard.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;For<br/>&gt; &gt;multiple chains of whatever interval, I imagine that the tones in a<br/>&gt; &gt;single chain would have to be arranged in a non-slanting row,<br/>&gt; &gt;typewriter-style.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think so -- rather, its the parallel notes in different<br/>&gt; chains that would form a non-slanting row.</p><p>Yes, I see.

That&apos;s not<br/>very useful if your goal is to have a regular temperament (other than<br/>an EDO) that accurately approximates small-number ratios.

I would have to<br/>say definitely not (because there are *separate* chains, each capable<br/>of having either a finite or infinite number of tones.  Each of the<br/>chains is, by itself, linear, and since you&apos;re adding another<br/>dimension by way of the interval separating adjacent chains, the<br/>result (even if you try to justify it as &quot;multiple lines&quot;) is no<br/>longer linear.

Have you received my paper yet? I believe I&apos;ve explored this<br/>question in ever-increasing depth over the past decade or so and my<br/>paper is a thumbnail sketch of part of this issue.</p><p>&gt;You&apos;re stuck with a<br/>&gt;proliferation of 600, 400, 300, or 240-cent intervals that don&apos;t come<br/>&gt;within a few cents of any consonance.</p><p>Other regular temperaments also have a proliferation of intervals<br/>that don&apos;t come within a few cents of any consonance. I believe my<br/>paper compares 2D temperaments on a truly level basis and some of the<br/>best do contain fraction-of-octave intervals. For example, the srutal<br/>system arises from tempering out the diaschisma or 2048:2025. This<br/>necessarily introduces half-octave intervals, which arise as<br/>representations of both 45:32 and 64:45. But the consonances in the<br/>system are about twice as accurate as in meantone, yet the complexity<br/>of the system is not unmanageable. A much more complex system is<br/>Ennealimmal, which divides the octave into 9 equal parts, but it is a<br/>far more accurate 7-limit 2D temperament than any other with similar<br/>or lower complexity, and is far simpler than other with similar<br/>accuracy (of the consonances).</p><p>I&apos;m completely convinced that you and Erv have genuinely missed some<br/>important possibilities due to your prejudice here, and I&apos;m certain<br/>that, given enough time, I can convince both of you of that.</p><p>&gt;Assuming octave equivalence, would this be linear?  I would have to<br/>say<br/>&gt;definitely not (because there are *separate* chains, each capable of<br/>&gt;having either a finite or infinite number of tones.  Each of the<br/>chains<br/>&gt;is, by itself, linear, and since you&apos;re adding another dimension by<br/>way<br/>&gt;of the interval separating adjacent chains, the result (even if you<br/>try<br/>&gt;to justify it as &quot;multiple lines&quot;) is no longer linear.  But it&apos;s not<br/>&gt;exactly the same as what we would call &quot;planar&quot; either, because one<br/>of<br/>&gt;your dimensions wraps back on itself after N tones.  I would be<br/>&gt;inclined to call it &quot;cylindrical&quot;.

Otherwise, you get a<br/>&gt; cyclic group of order 12, but the elements do not represent pitches,<br/>&gt; but pitch classes.</p><p>Okay, I stand corrected -- it&apos;s pitch classes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Now if you have two infinite chains 1/2-octave apart, you then<br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt; two dimensions, one infinite and the other finite (as a sort of<br/>wire-<br/>&gt; &gt; frame cylinder).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want to think of it in a confusing way.

A &quot;G<br/>dominant<br/>&gt; &gt; 7th chord,&quot; which is normally considered to be composed of 4<br/>separate<br/>&gt; &gt; pitches, maintains its identity regardless of the order, spacing<br/>&gt; &gt; (octave displacement), or doubling (at another octave) of its<br/>tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, but that is in terms of pitch *classes*. When discussing<br/>&gt; temperament, it is not helpful to introduce those. It makes far more<br/>&gt; sense to stick to pitches, in which case, since there isn&apos;t any<br/>&gt; torsion in the positive reals under multiplication (quite unlike the<br/>&gt; case with complex numbers!) there can&apos;t be any in a subgroup.</p><p>Well, I guess what you&apos;re saying makes more sense from a<br/>mathematician&apos;s point of view.</p><p>&gt; &gt; We perceive pitch in such a way that multiplication or division<br/>by 2<br/>&gt; &gt; does not change its identity, and I would say that a<br/>classification<br/>&gt; &gt; of temperaments that doesn&apos;t take that into account would be less<br/>&gt; &gt; useful than one that does.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can take it into account by making one of the generators the nth<br/>&gt; part of an octave, but introducing octave equivalence into the<br/>theory<br/>&gt; of temperaments simply confuses the issue.</p><p>If n=1 the temperament is much simpler from a musical point of view<br/>(in which octave equivalence is assumed).  Historical tunings or<br/>temperaments (e.g., Pythagorean, meantone, equal, etc.) with (pure)<br/>octave and (pure or tempered) fifth generators have traditionally<br/>been regarded as &quot;linear&quot; in that they consist of a single sequence<br/>of fifths, with octave-equivalence assumed.</p><p>But change the octave generator to 1/n octaves and you have something<br/>that&apos;s musically more complicated, with n chains of fifths.  It would<br/>be very confusing to call something like that &quot;linear.&quot;  Better not<br/>to use the term at all.  I think I saw that you&apos;re in the process of<br/>adopting different terminology, yes?  If so, is there a<br/>terminological distinction between temperaments with octave and non-<br/>octave generators?  (I would include octaves tempered by no more than<br/>a few cents in the octave-generator category.)  Such a distinction<br/>would be very useful from the ordinary musician&apos;s point of view.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=57447 href="#57447">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2005 1:48:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;George D.
