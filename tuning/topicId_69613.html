From time to time, though, I do a<br/>drive-by reading of this list just to see what&apos;s happenin&apos;. The<br/>current discussion about EDO and TET systems that can be used to<br/>quantify Arabic intonation has prompted me to pop in and give my two<br/>cents worth, &apos;cause it&apos;s an area I&apos;m very interested in and concerned<br/>about, if only from the point of view of someone who loves microtonal<br/>music of all kinds and listens to a lot of Arabic recordings.</p><p>I have to  say that I think the whole discussion is utterly pointless,<br/>a symptom of an outmoded manner of thinking. Temperament of any kind<br/>is a compromise required only when the musical instrument produces<br/>tones from a fixed and limited gamut. This mostly means keyboards,<br/>organs and fretted strings, since just about anything else either has<br/>flexible intonation or can be retuned quickly to suit each piece<br/>(including the qanun). The big mistake that so many people make is to<br/>equate this limited gamut with the way musicians produce music in the<br/>larger sense, which leads to attempts to pin things down to a certain<br/>system. In regards to western classical music, I call this &quot;keyboard<br/>myopia&quot;, the idea that the compromise situation somehow represents<br/>some basic underlying musical structure instead of a mere basnd-aid<br/>solution. This manifests itself in the ideas that musicians in the<br/>Baroque, left to their own devices (i.e. when not accompanied by an<br/>inflexible tempered instrument), would play in this or that<br/>temperament, much as some (though not all) musicians today will play<br/>in equal temperament. This is putting the cart before the horse.</p><p>In regards to the current discussion (which I admittedly have not had<br/>the patience to read through in its entirety, so pardon me if this<br/>point has already been made), I see no use whatsoever in pinning down<br/>any flavor of Arabic intonation with any fixed gamut, no matter how<br/>clever the math behind its construction nor how numerous and fine the<br/>steps. Why do it? Theoretically, its seems as though everyone agrees<br/>such systems even at best are only approximations, and the discussion<br/>seems to always end up in how close one can get with this or that<br/>number of EDO steps. Practically speaking, many modern synthesizers<br/>are capable of infinite retuning; why restrict ourselves to the<br/>&quot;approximations&quot; of some intellectual construct? Pointless . . .<br/>utterly pointless.</p><p>Here&apos;s the rub; with the advent of cheap musical synthesizers, the<br/>MIDI system, and software synths, I really worry about the wonderful<br/>variety of intonation being lost forever by the process of &quot;musical<br/>globalization&quot;, that is, the erosion of intonation variety as<br/>musicians accept the functional (in)capabilities of electronic<br/>instruments which can only produce tones according to compromise<br/>systems thought up by those with such a fixed-gamut mentality. This<br/>would not only be a great loss, but would also be completely<br/>unnecessary, as there is no reason whatsoever to let it happen, other<br/>than (bad) habit, ignorance, and laziness.</p><p>To this end, I have been mulling over an idea for a year or so, and I<br/>thought I would toss it out for comment before I start getting serious<br/>about realizing it. I have the idea of making a MIDI interactive<br/>interface which would allow keyboard players to participate in the<br/>making of Arabic music in such a manner that they would not<br/>necessarily have to force intonation into any predefined intellectual<br/>straightjecket. The idea is to have a large touch screen that would<br/>assemble sets of tuning for the synthesizer which can be loaded<br/>instantly during performance. Each tuning would be constructed by<br/>assembling the maqam using its component ajnas in a manner which<br/>reflects traditional theory as I understand it, which admittedly is<br/>based only on reading the very good explanations on <a href="http://maqamworld.com">maqamworld.com</a>.<br/>Thus, you start building a maqam tuning table by selecting a jins and<br/>specifying its starting note. Then you select the next jins and the<br/>manner in which it is joined to the first, either conjunct on a<br/>certain specified note of the first jins or disjunct by a<br/>user-definable interval. Each jins could be tuned and stored in the<br/>memory in as many forms as desired to reflect regional variations in<br/>tuning. Tuning entry would be in frequency, cents, or tone-matching,<br/>not as members of any predefined and limited EDO or TET set. The<br/>ultimate arbiter would be the musicians ear. Jins/maqam names could be<br/>displayed on the screen either in both English and Arabic.</p><p>Regarding transposition/mutation, when different maqams and/or ajnas<br/>are used in one piece, they could be preselected and the pivotal<br/>points of transposition/mutation defined. They could either be<br/>propositioned on the screen and the musician could select them<br/>manually as needed in real time, or the transposition/mutation<br/>sequence could be preprogrammed and the musician need only push a<br/>&quot;next&quot; button at each moment in the piece. There could also be a<br/>completely flexible real-time mode where the musician could select a<br/>tone from the current maqam merely by tapping it on screen, and then<br/>select the new maqam or jins that would start on that note. This would<br/>allow the keyboard musician real-time flexibility approaching that of<br/>a flexible intonation instrument for improvisation.</p><p>I envision the system as a sort of virtual qanun. I&apos;d really like to<br/>know what the experienced Arabic musicians here think of such an idea?<br/>Useful, or a waste of time?</p><p>Ultimately, in regards to microtonal music in general, I think we need<br/>a complete reworking of the MIDI protocol, which is irreparably based<br/>on a fixed-gamut mentality. In order to become truly flexible in<br/>allowing the performance of microtonal music, we must abandon the<br/>&quot;note on/off&quot; system in which the note identifier is a number<br/>indicating a key, even if each key can be retuned or remapped to a<br/>limited (and that&apos;s the problem) extent. This is stupid. A much better<br/>system would be to simply give every note a temporal sequential<br/>&quot;event&quot; code, followed by a couple of tuning bytes which specify the<br/>exact frequency. For example, at the moment any key is played, it is<br/>given the next available &quot;event&quot; identifier byte. The same identifier<br/>is used for all subsequent information (aftertouch, pitch bend, etc.)<br/>regarding that note until the &quot;note off&quot; is sent. This would allow<br/>ultimate flexibility in creating and using any number of keyboard<br/>interfaces, mapped to any manner of intonation system. Gone is the<br/>need for such cumbersome monstrosities as high value double-digit EDO<br/>or TET systems. This would remove the technological bottleneck and<br/>bring the MIDI system into the 21st century, as well as remind<br/>musicians that the ultimate purpose is making music and not<br/>constructing intricate mathematical glass bead games.</p><p>Comments welcome.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>Paul</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2007 12:15:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Poletti&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I have to  say that I think the whole discussion is utterly<br/>pointless,<br/>&gt; a symptom of an outmoded manner of thinking.</p><p>Possibly, but Ozan, who knows more about it than either of us, is<br/>convinced it would be useful.</p><p>&gt; Temperament of any kind<br/>&gt; is a compromise required only when the musical instrument produces<br/>&gt; tones from a fixed and limited gamut.</p><p>This just isn&apos;t true.

The qanun circle in Istanbul is in general agreement, that they are<br/>suffering from grave tuning issues when performing in ensembles<br/>incorporating unfretted instruments. Which is why they have shown great<br/>interest in my 79-tone qanun that I twice presented to their audience. For<br/>one thing, I have behind me the support and appreciation of renowned Turkish<br/>qanun players such as Ruhi Ayangil, Halil Karaduman, Erol Deran, and Nevzat<br/>Sumer. These, among others, admire the fact that the 79-tone model can solve<br/>many issues that pester them when performing Maqam Music on stage.</p><p>Retuned quickly to suit each piece?

This is putting the cart before the horse.<br/>&gt;</p><p>How is this relevant to the discussion which necessitates some kind of<br/>theory conforming with the music practice in the Near East?

And it is not some passing<br/>fancy either, seeing as it IS implemented on an actual acoustic instrument.<br/>What has Europe settling for 12 equal tones due to the prominence of<br/>keyboard-based or influenced music got to do with the problems Maqam Music<br/>suffers from?</p><p>&gt; In regards to the current discussion (which I admittedly have not had<br/>&gt; the patience to read through in its entirety, so pardon me if this<br/>&gt; point has already been made), I see no use whatsoever in pinning down<br/>&gt; any flavor of Arabic intonation with any fixed gamut, no matter how<br/>&gt; clever the math behind its construction nor how numerous and fine the<br/>&gt; steps.

What shall we call it, then? Maqam<br/>tradition music? That doesn&apos;t exactly allow for Greek stuff, does it?<br/>You tell me. . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you corresponded with any qanun players to verify your preposterous<br/>&gt; claims?</p><p>Nope, I&apos;m afraid I haven&apos;t. I&apos;ve spoken with a few after concerts, but<br/>none in the Turkish tradition.</p><p>&gt; The qanun circle in Istanbul is in general agreement, that they are<br/>&gt; suffering from grave tuning issues when performing in ensembles<br/>&gt; incorporating unfretted instruments.</p><p>A common problem in all traditions, I think. That&apos;s why in western<br/>tradition, keyboards and fretted instruments were called &quot;imperfect&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Which is why they have shown great<br/>&gt; interest in my 79-tone qanun that I twice presented to their<br/>audience. For<br/>&gt; one thing, I have behind me the support and appreciation of renowned<br/>Turkish<br/>&gt; qanun players such as Ruhi Ayangil, Halil Karaduman, Erol Deran, and<br/>Nevzat<br/>&gt; Sumer. These, among others, admire the fact that the 79-tone model<br/>can solve<br/>&gt; many issues that pester them when performing Maqam Music on stage.</p><p>Perhaps it does, in which case I stand corrected. I would honestly ask<br/>you, is it REALLY neccessary to have all these tones available at all<br/>times? Or, if we could conceive of an instrument with say, for the<br/>sake of argument, half this number but which could be rapidly and<br/>accurately retuned between numbers, would that suffice?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Retuned quickly to suit each piece? Nothing can be further from the<br/>truth.<br/>&gt; There is neither time nor the occasion to re-calibrate qanuns<br/>extensively<br/>&gt; during live performance.</p><p>We have the same problem in the &quot;early music&quot; world. Modern concert<br/>hall managers do not have the patience generally, though I found that<br/>audiences are very understanding when I have tuned for a number of<br/>concerts where I have changed all the Eb&apos;s to D#&apos;s during pieces. And<br/>some old treatises say to do this. Perhaps the situation is far more<br/>complex with qanun. Which would raise an interesting question: what<br/>exactly was the role of this instrument before the introduction of<br/>your archi-qanun-ichord, if I may make a little word joke? I always<br/>thought that it was &quot;the law&quot;, as the name states, THE instrument<br/>which defined the intonation. Is this just more internet nonsense?<br/>Please elucidate.</p><p>&gt; The big mistake that so many people make is to<br/>&gt; &gt; equate this limited gamut with the way musicians produce music in the<br/>&gt; &gt; larger sense, which leads to attempts to pin things down to a certain<br/>&gt; &gt; system.</p><p>&gt; And what is wrong with that when so many benefits are reaped by that<br/>&gt; approach?</p><p>What is wrong with it is IF it destroys some the refinements of some<br/>REAL tradition in the process. I&apos;m not saying this is the case, but<br/>that is what I would offer as an argument against it. Your arguments<br/>sound identical to those used to sell 12 TET to western musicians<br/>during the 18th century, which causes me to doubt.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In regards to western classical music, I call this &quot;keyboard<br/>&gt; &gt; myopia&quot;, the idea that the compromise situation somehow represents<br/>&gt; &gt; some basic underlying musical structure instead of a mere basnd-aid<br/>&gt; &gt; solution. This manifests itself in the ideas that musicians in the<br/>&gt; &gt; Baroque, left to their own devices (i.e. when not accompanied by an<br/>&gt; &gt; inflexible tempered instrument), would play in this or that<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament, much as some (though not all) musicians today will play<br/>&gt; &gt; in equal temperament. This is putting the cart before the horse.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How is this relevant to the discussion which necessitates some kind of<br/>&gt; theory conforming with the music practice in the Near East?</p><p>Merely a metaphor. Perhaps there is no relevance.</p><p>&gt; The 79-tone<br/>&gt; skeleton explains better than any of the systems thus far proposed the<br/>&gt; traditional perdes and flavours of Maqam Music. And it is not some<br/>passing<br/>&gt; fancy either, seeing as it IS implemented on an actual acoustic<br/>instrument.</p><p>This argument sounds exactly like any number of microtonal keyboards<br/>which have been presented to solve the western tuning problems, from<br/>Mersenne&apos;s 19-tone keyboard to Harry Parch. The problem with all these<br/>systems is that they rarely succeed precisely because they try to be<br/>everything for everybody and thereby become too complex.</p><p>&gt; What has Europe settling for 12 equal tones due to the prominence of<br/>&gt; keyboard-based or influenced music got to do with the problems Maqam<br/>Music<br/>&gt; suffers from?</p><p>I&apos;m really surprised you don&apos;t see the parallels. It has to do with<br/>the problem of how to incorporate instruments of limited intonation by<br/>nature of their small number of discrete dedicated sound producing<br/>units in a musical environment which calls for a much larger number of<br/>pitches. Same problem, different details, that&apos;s all.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So is the idea of notation then. Pointless! Why? So that people<br/>might employ<br/>&gt; such devices to elevate music from crude monody to microtonal polyphony?</p><p>I think you are mixing apples and oranges here. I would certainly<br/>agree that a better notation system is needed to transmit and preserve<br/>microtonal music, though using symbols on paper to do it is certainly<br/>NOT cutting-edge.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, what is at stake is more than &quot;approximation&quot;, but proper<br/>&quot;expression&quot;<br/>&gt; for accurate execution and consistent education of the tradition.</p><p>Knowing how classical Indian musical training works, and how I learned<br/>to play blues, I&apos;d say ANY system of symbolizing music is second rate<br/>to any aural tradition. We also now have recording technology which<br/>vastly outstrips any system of symbolic notation in terms of<br/>preserving and transmitting subtleties of intonation, rhythm,<br/>articulation, inflection, and dynamics. The only thing symbolic<br/>notation is really good at is polyphony/harmony.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &apos;tis but the &quot;keyboard myopia&quot; talking. MIDI is not just about 12-tone<br/>&gt; keyboards, but also, other controllers that, if you are able to<br/>master them,<br/>&gt; can aid in the creation of wonders, as was the case with the youtube<br/>&gt; demonstrations of the past month.</p><p>Yeah yeah, I know about this stuff, a lot of my colleagues are working<br/>on alternative controllers. But I am interested more in controllers<br/>that allow discrete production of accurate individual tones, like a<br/>good violinist, but resembling a keyboard in terms of allowing<br/>multiple tone production. MIDI is pretty bad at this because of the<br/>way the note tuning commands are sent (you can&apos;t send a temporal<br/>cluster of closely tuned pitches, for example, unless you remap the<br/>note frequency table in the synthesizer) and the limitation to 128<br/>notes. For example, it would even handle two octaves of your 79 note<br/>system.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And this compartmentalization is supposed to facilitate the<br/>understanding<br/>&gt; and execution of Maqam Music? By evading altogether any solid<br/>temperament<br/>&gt; solution, you have complicated matters to such an extent, that<br/>performing<br/>&gt; the genre now becomes a drudgery.</p><p>I would really like to know to what extent and how many great<br/>violinists, singers, or oud players in any of the maqam traditions<br/>think that a &quot;solid temperament solution&quot; is essential to their<br/>performance. I&apos;m suspect we won&apos;t be able to get an objective answer<br/>from you, though, as it is obvious which camp you are in. Not intended<br/>as any sort of slight, just a statement of the situation. Any other<br/>voices out there?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And moreover, this constant Arabocentrism with no heed for Turks,<br/>Persians,<br/>&gt; Azeris, Berbers, Indians, etc... is beginning to get tiresome.</p><p>Obviously your own axe to grind. Sorry if I pushed your button in that<br/>respect. Totally unintentional.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would like to see someone try and play that in realtime!</p><p>Not half as complicated as changing organ registrations with one hand<br/>while playing a Bach fugue. I managed just fine. Or doing some of the<br/>on the fly scordatura I&apos;ve seen some guitarists and violinists do.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; as an unexperienced Turkish musician, I find it a hoot.</p><p>Thanks for your opinion. Anyone else?</p><p>Now, how would YOU resolve the problem of young musicians of any of<br/>the above cultures getting modern synthesizers and wanting to use them<br/>to play their traditional music? Screw &apos;em? Or tell them to wait until<br/>they can save up $8000 for a keyboard that will handle your 70 note<br/>system. What are the chances of them doing that?</p><p>&gt; Not that I am religious about it, but what have you got against the<br/>utility<br/>&gt; of fixed tones anyway? Have you tried performing some maqams on the<br/>79-tone<br/>&gt; skeletal model first?</p><p>Nope. I just want to come up with something that allows musicians to<br/>use off-the-shelf MIDI controllers to play music microtonal accurately<br/>intoned. I get sick when I hear &quot;world music&quot; warped and distorted to<br/>12 TET. I&apos;m much more in the flexible adaptive tuning camp than the<br/>fixed gamut camp. Naturally, the nature of the problem suggests some<br/>sort of predefined gamut. Whether or not this gamut need include ALL<br/>possibilties for ALL imaginable circumstances is an arguable point. I<br/>think it is only necessary when the musical performace truly requires<br/>the production of all of these pitches. Just because someday sometime<br/>I MIGHT need to use a certain pitch is no need to provide a button I<br/>can push to make it. Technology offers the promise of chameleon<br/>interfaces - why should we limit them to compromise tuning systems. If<br/>we KNOW that a certain tradition uses certain pitches, just program<br/>THOSE pitches into the thing and GO! Who cares if it all fits some<br/>grand theory or not?</p><p>I also don&apos;t like the intellectualization of things that I feel are<br/>primarily sensual aspects of music.</p><p>Thanks for your comments.

How else could I learn how to play the marvelous<br/>preludes and fugues of Bach otherwise?</p><p>We also now have recording technology which<br/>&gt; vastly outstrips any system of symbolic notation in terms of<br/>&gt; preserving and transmitting subtleties of intonation, rhythm,<br/>&gt; articulation, inflection, and dynamics. The only thing symbolic<br/>&gt; notation is really good at is polyphony/harmony.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I concur. That is why the general tendency of Maqam Music circles was toward<br/>the acceptance of Western staff notation. Now is nigh time to move on to the<br/>next step and adopt a theory that not only agrees with tradition, but also<br/>paves the way for microtonal polyphony.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;tis but the &quot;keyboard myopia&quot; talking. MIDI is not just about 12-tone<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboards, but also, other controllers that, if you are able to<br/>&gt; master them,<br/>&gt; &gt; can aid in the creation of wonders, as was the case with the youtube<br/>&gt; &gt; demonstrations of the past month.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yeah yeah, I know about this stuff, a lot of my colleagues are working<br/>&gt; on alternative controllers. But I am interested more in controllers<br/>&gt; that allow discrete production of accurate individual tones, like a<br/>&gt; good violinist, but resembling a keyboard in terms of allowing<br/>&gt; multiple tone production. MIDI is pretty bad at this because of the<br/>&gt; way the note tuning commands are sent (you can&apos;t send a temporal<br/>&gt; cluster of closely tuned pitches, for example, unless you remap the<br/>&gt; note frequency table in the synthesizer) and the limitation to 128<br/>&gt; notes. For example, it would even handle two octaves of your 79 note<br/>&gt; system.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MIDI is not my criterion for advancing the 79-tone model.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And this compartmentalization is supposed to facilitate the<br/>&gt; understanding<br/>&gt; &gt; and execution of Maqam Music? By evading altogether any solid<br/>&gt; temperament<br/>&gt; &gt; solution, you have complicated matters to such an extent, that<br/>&gt; performing<br/>&gt; &gt; the genre now becomes a drudgery.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would really like to know to what extent and how many great<br/>&gt; violinists, singers, or oud players in any of the maqam traditions<br/>&gt; think that a &quot;solid temperament solution&quot; is essential to their<br/>&gt; performance.</p><p>It is not. This temperament solution is essential for qanuns to<br/>*faultlessly* accompany violinists, oudists, singers, etc... AND to<br/>represent on paper the fine details of maqamat.</p><p>I&apos;m suspect we won&apos;t be able to get an objective answer<br/>&gt; from you,</p><p>Tsk tsk. Such prejudice.</p><p>though, as it is obvious which camp you are in. Not intended<br/>&gt; as any sort of slight, just a statement of the situation. Any other<br/>&gt; voices out there?</p><p>Hopefully.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And moreover, this constant Arabocentrism with no heed for Turks,<br/>&gt; Persians,<br/>&gt; &gt; Azeris, Berbers, Indians, etc... is beginning to get tiresome.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously your own axe to grind. Sorry if I pushed your button in that<br/>&gt; respect. Totally unintentional.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Very well then.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would like to see someone try and play that in realtime!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not half as complicated as changing organ registrations with one hand<br/>&gt; while playing a Bach fugue. I managed just fine. Or doing some of the<br/>&gt; on the fly scordatura I&apos;ve seen some guitarists and violinists do.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Scordatura. I like that concept.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; as an unexperienced Turkish musician, I find it a hoot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for your opinion. Anyone else?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, how would YOU resolve the problem of young musicians of any of<br/>&gt; the above cultures getting modern synthesizers and wanting to use them<br/>&gt; to play their traditional music? Screw &apos;em?</p><p>I don&apos;t think so. That would be improper.</p><p>Or tell them to wait until<br/>&gt; they can save up $8000 for a keyboard that will handle your 70 note<br/>&gt; system. What are the chances of them doing that?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Such a pessimist. Do you suppose your solution is less costly?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Not that I am religious about it, but what have you got against the<br/>&gt; utility<br/>&gt; &gt; of fixed tones anyway? Have you tried performing some maqams on the<br/>&gt; 79-tone<br/>&gt; &gt; skeletal model first?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nope. I just want to come up with something that allows musicians to<br/>&gt; use off-the-shelf MIDI controllers to play music microtonal accurately<br/>&gt; intoned. I get sick when I hear &quot;world music&quot; warped and distorted to<br/>&gt; 12 TET.</p><p>Agreed.</p><p>I&apos;m much more in the flexible adaptive tuning camp than the<br/>&gt; fixed gamut camp.</p><p>I don&apos;t reject flexible tuning at all. Nevertheless, a comprehensive layout<br/>requires a fixed gamut.</p><p>Naturally, the nature of the problem suggests some<br/>&gt; sort of predefined gamut. Whether or not this gamut need include ALL<br/>&gt; possibilties for ALL imaginable circumstances is an arguable point.</p><p>Hence, the spectrum from 12 all to way to 612-equal.</p><p>I<br/>&gt; think it is only necessary when the musical performace truly requires<br/>&gt; the production of all of these pitches. Just because someday sometime<br/>&gt; I MIGHT need to use a certain pitch is no need to provide a button I<br/>&gt; can push to make it. Technology offers the promise of chameleon<br/>&gt; interfaces - why should we limit them to compromise tuning systems. If<br/>&gt; we KNOW that a certain tradition uses certain pitches, just program<br/>&gt; THOSE pitches into the thing and GO! Who cares if it all fits some<br/>&gt; grand theory or not?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Be my guest if you can implement THAT chameleon on an actual qanun.</p><p>&gt; I also don&apos;t like the intellectualization of things that I feel are<br/>&gt; primarily sensual aspects of music.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Huh?</p><p>&gt; Thanks for your comments. I mean it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ciao,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p></div>
