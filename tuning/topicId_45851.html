It is a picturesquely vibrant<br/>environment with a biological diversity that encompasses fifty percent of the<br/>world&rsquo;s entire species of plants, animals, insets and microorganisms.&nbsp; In<br/>essence, this forest ecology is theoretically composed of four principal layers, and<br/>collectively presents an organic vista of giant trees towering over a dense<br/>canopy, which accordingly casts a shadow on the dark understory existing above<br/>the forest floor.&nbsp; The climate of this unique ecosystem&nbsp; is auspiciously<br/>maintained at a temperature of between twenty and thirty degrees Celsius, and<br/>exceptionally nourished and invigorated by torrential rains possible of reproducing<br/>five centimetres of rain an hour, or the equivalent of one thousand<br/>centimetres per year (with a worldwide annual average of two hundred and thirty-four<br/>centimetres).<br/>    Cultural diversity is also in abundance, and the four distinct rainforest<br/>societies that will be analyzed in this paper within a predominantly<br/>musically physiological paradigm (the Suy&aacute; of Brazil, Kaluli of Papua New Guinea,<br/>Mbuti of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Temiar of Malaysia) represent but<br/>only some of its transcendent allure, but will nevertheless provide an insight<br/>into the enchanting world of the people of the forest and their musical forms<br/>of expression.&nbsp; In spite of the obvious physical distances between these<br/>geographically unconnected societies, one of the principal factors that accommodates<br/>a pedagogic point of unity is their unique environment, which not only<br/>provides subsistence with a combination of agricultural, hunting, gathering and<br/>fishing practices, and comparable systems of social organization and artistic<br/>expression,&nbsp; but additionally endows them with the totality of their philosophical<br/>belief system.</p><p>THE SUY&Aacute; OF BRAZIL</p><p>    Along the shores of the Sui&aacute;-missu River, and within the periphery of the<br/>Xingu National Park that is situated in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil,<br/>live the Suy&aacute; Indians in a circular village with a population barely surpassing<br/>the centesimal mark.<br/>    The Suy&aacute; musical repertoire includes seasonal and ceremonial songs, but<br/>no sociopolitical or philosophical justification for love songs, protest songs<br/>or lullabies.&nbsp; The act of singing is an integral part of social and economic<br/>reproduction, and the aesthetic value of song is ascertained from the<br/>collective perspective, hence greater the participation, greater the &lsquo;beauty&rsquo; of<br/>song.&nbsp; The Suy&aacute; concept of person (involving the components of physical body,<br/>social identity and spirit) is manifested through song, and with the ultimate goal<br/>of achieving a certain cosmological balance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Songs also provide the link<br/>between humans and animals, thereby legitimizing the perceptible spiritual<br/>reality of mythology.&nbsp; &ldquo;Songs made the events recounted in the myths real to every<br/>member of the society.&nbsp; Myths described transformations; in certain ceremonies<br/>people experienced them,&rdquo; explains Anthony Seeger in Why Suy&aacute; Sing: A musical<br/>anthropology of an Amazonian people.<br/>    Suy&aacute; vocal art forms include instruction (sar&eacute;n), speech (kap&eacute;rni),<br/>invocation (sang&eacute;re) and song (ng&eacute;re).&nbsp; Instruction refers to any kind of verbal<br/>guidance, recounting of myth, and ceremonial public addresses, whereas speech<br/>alternatively refers to everyday conversation, and utterances expressing<br/>jealousy, anger and social virtue.&nbsp; Invocations are within the domain of the ritual<br/>specialists, and is a recited verbal form practiced by both men and women as a<br/>curative treatment.&nbsp; There are two main song genres, one being akia (shout<br/>songs), which are individual songs performed either in singularity or<br/>simultaneous plurality by males,&rsquo; and the other ng&eacute;re (unison songs), being collective<br/>songs.&nbsp; The socio-musicological role of women restricted to that of<br/>&lsquo;non-singing&rsquo; ceremonial assistant and participant observer, apart from minor Suy&aacute; and<br/>Upper Xingu originated female genres.&nbsp; The act of singing is accompanied by a<br/>variety of rattles constructed either out of animal hooves, fruit pits, gourds,<br/>brass shotgun shells or small metal bells, and made to sound by characteristic<br/>dance movements that mimic the animal kingdom (namely mice and deer).<br/>    The power to originate songs is believed to materialize in a person after<br/>a long period of illness, brought on by the angry actions of a jealous witch,<br/>who misappropriates that person&rsquo;s spirit (megaron) for not having imparted<br/>the expected amount of comestible offerings to that witch.&nbsp; The spirit is hence<br/>transferred to the dominion of a certain entity (associated with the item in<br/>question, honey equals bees, et cetera), and its loss initially causing grave<br/>illness, although later enabling the person to transcend linguistic barriers<br/>with the natural world and acquire songs.&nbsp; One Suy&aacute; man describes the experience<br/>thus, &ldquo;I was walking in the forest and a tree said to me, &lsquo;Friend&rsquo;.&nbsp; I said,<br/>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo;&nbsp; The tree said, &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; and I replied, &lsquo;Nowhere in<br/>particular&rsquo;.&nbsp; The tree said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s sing&rsquo; and I saw all of the trees singing<br/>and they were all singing akia and other types of songs.&rdquo;&nbsp; These become known<br/>as the &lsquo;songs from men without spirits&rsquo; (me katodn k&iuml;di), who are effectually<br/>ritual specialists that have experienced an incomplete metamorphosis.&nbsp; The<br/>other two origins of songs are &lsquo;songs in myths&rsquo;, with a notable source of partly<br/>human, partly animal beings (from transformation myths of long ago,<br/>celebrated today within the &lsquo;Savannah Deer&rsquo;, &lsquo;Wild Pig&rsquo; and &lsquo;Enemy Child&rsquo;<br/>ceremonies), and &lsquo;foreign songs&rsquo; adopted from non-Suy&aacute; visitors of the village, which<br/>additionally transmit external energies of power and knowledge onto the<br/>community.<br/>    The akia genre is the most remarkable of Suy&aacute; musical expression, and a<br/>song form that has no regional ethnomusicological association.&nbsp; In the cyclical<br/>process of ceremonial life, and its many rites of passage, a male will<br/>acquire repertoire with the occurrence of every event.&nbsp; These include songs of his<br/>father, mother&rsquo;s brother and grandfather, as well as of other men (regardless<br/>of being alive or dead).&nbsp; The performance of akia is either a solo affair or a<br/>collective &lsquo;synchronous assault of the airwaves&rsquo; by a group of men singing<br/>his own akia at the same time (a Suy&aacute; concept called aimen-twa-wid-ngre or<br/>&lsquo;together each sings his own&rsquo;).<br/>    One of the notable settings of the akia and ng&eacute;re genres is the Mouse<br/>Ceremony, which is a two-week long &lsquo;marathon&rsquo; celebrating a boy&rsquo;s initiation<br/>into his name set, and in direct response to the myth of &lsquo;The Mouse that Gave the<br/>Woman Corn&rsquo; (which tells the tale of how the Suy&aacute; used to eat rotten wood<br/>until the mouse told them about corn), but without a directly associated mythical<br/>transformation originated repertoire.&nbsp; The men&rsquo;s symbolic departure from<br/>their natal household in the final day of the Mouse Ceremony, and their singing of<br/>individual shout songs for their sisters and mothers is an important<br/>philosophical aspect of Suy&aacute; culture.&nbsp; The men wear &lsquo;mouse capes&rsquo;, sing &lsquo;mouse<br/>songs&rsquo;, at times actually behave like mice, and once symbolically transformed into<br/>mice, the power of the metamorphosis is the guiding force of the name givers,<br/>and subsequently of the boy&rsquo;s initiation into his name set.&nbsp; At the conclusion<br/>of the ceremony the women emerge with hunting arrows to pierce their<br/>brother&rsquo;s capes, symbolically killing the mice, and hence transforming them back into<br/>men.</p><p>ADRIAN PERTOUT<br/>&apos;Mixdown&apos;

(being the<br/>self-denomination that is shared between four culturally identical but linguistically<br/>distinct subgroups) coexist in twenty longhouse communities (with each one made up<br/>of groups of fifteen families numbering a total of sixty to eighty people),<br/>and inhabit the Melanesian rainforests north of Mount Bosavi, on the Great<br/>Papuan Plateau in the Southern Highlands province of Papua New Guinea.<br/>    For the Kaluli, the substance of musical expression is entirely<br/>metaphorically derived from their Papua New Guinean forest environment, with bird<br/>sounds providing the principal inspiration for the scalar archetypes, water sounds<br/>the structural components, and mythology the rationalist theorem.&nbsp; At the core<br/>of aesthetic consolidation with the natural and spiritual world is the raison<br/>d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre for the notion of dulugu ganalan or &lsquo;lift-up-over sounding&rsquo;, which is<br/>essentially the discernibly audible overlapping, alternating, and<br/>interlocking quality of the &lsquo;Kaluli groove&rsquo;.&nbsp; The greater significance of the forest&rsquo;s<br/>symbolic importance is intensified by the belief that it is the home of ane<br/>mama or &lsquo;gone reflections&rsquo; spirits of the Kaluli dead, which are in active<br/>communication with the living world through bird song.<br/>    Out of the six vocal genres in existence (gisalo, koluba, sabio, iwo,<br/>heyalo and kelekeliyoba), gisalo represents a Kaluli men&rsquo;s innovation, and is<br/>performed only during particular ceremonies and seances.&nbsp; The only other two<br/>forms that appropriate composition include heyalo and koluba, which are in<br/>comparison genres designated to be sung within the social contexts of work and<br/>leisure, as well as ceremonial.&nbsp; Other forms include women&rsquo;s sung texted weeping<br/>(sa-yelab) and cheering (uwolab), men&rsquo;s whooping (ulab), instrumental drumming<br/>(ilib) and bamboo Jew&rsquo;s harp playing (uluna).&nbsp; The components that additionally<br/>yield rhythmic vitality to Kaluli ceremonial singing include the sologa<br/>(seedpod rattle), degegado (crayfish claw rattle) and sob (mussel shell rattle).<br/>    To understand the Kaluli methodology of composition and performance it is<br/>essential to firstly understand the impetus that breathes within this<br/>culture&rsquo;s bona fide metaphysical relationship with birds.&nbsp; The presence of<br/>sentimentality may be illustrated within the myth of &lsquo;The Boy who Became a Muni Bird&rsquo;,<br/>because this is the spiritual connection that evokes strong emotions in<br/>performance.&nbsp; In the social setting of the traditional all night ceremonies (held at<br/>the host longhouse), guest composers and performers use the gisalo idiom to<br/>draw feelings of nostalgia, reflection and sentimentality from the host.&nbsp;<br/>Spirit medium seances have similar ambitions, although in this context visiting<br/>spirits sing gisalo songs through the mouths of mediums, conveying the expression<br/>of spirit beings and place names in the text to generate the characteristic<br/>&lsquo;melodically patterned&rsquo; weeping from the audience that symbolizes the call of<br/>the muni bird.<br/>    The archetypal scalar pattern of gisalo also literally being a<br/>transcription of the euphonious call of the muni bird (the beautiful fruitdove,<br/>Ptilinopus pulchellus) further signifies that &lsquo;song&rsquo; is in essence the symbolic<br/>marriage between the melodic pattern of birds with the talk pattern of birds.&nbsp;<br/>Standard melodies or gisalo kotogodo are additionally created from these muni bird<br/>tones (often for the purpose of inaugurating the amateur composer) and<br/>combined with textual material to form a gisalo song.&nbsp; Steven Feld,<br/>ethnomusicologist and author of Sound and Sentiment: Birds, Weeping, Poetics, and Song in<br/>Kaluli Expression notes, &ldquo;As I learned about the symbolism of the weeping and<br/>singing voice I was taught about their intimate connection to rainforest birds.&rdquo;<br/>    The complex structure of songs is characterized by the physiological<br/>impression of the melodic element of song (gisalo) representing &lsquo;bird sounds&rsquo;<br/>(obe gono) and the textual element (Sa-gisalo or &lsquo;words inside gisalo&rsquo;)<br/>representing &lsquo;bird sound words&rsquo; (obe gono to).&nbsp; A refined perspective of this<br/>ideology elucidates the Kaluli notion of molan or &lsquo;one sings&rsquo; (which usually means<br/>the vocalization of either both text and melody or simply melody alone) and its<br/>cosmological extension of sa-molan or &lsquo;one sings inside&rsquo;, which means<br/>&lsquo;singing inside one&rsquo;s head&rsquo; or in other words to &lsquo;compose song&rsquo;.&nbsp; These concepts<br/>of duality that clearly surround the artistry of Kaluli song reveal that<br/>because melodic appropriation is derived from nature, it is perceived to come from<br/>&lsquo;outside and around&rsquo;, whereas textual invention which is derived from grey<br/>matter is dissimilarly perceived to come from &lsquo;inside and down&rsquo;.<br/>    There are nine principal terms in the Kaluli terminology of melodic<br/>intervals and contours of gisalo, with the two main intervals being sa (descending<br/>minor 3rd, and also the word for waterfall) and gese (descending major 2nd,<br/>and an extraction of gesema, with the connotation of &lsquo;make one feel sorrow or<br/>pity&rsquo;).&nbsp; These intervals are evident in the call of the muni bird, hence also in<br/>gisalo and sa-yelab (melodic weeping), and all nomenclature (with but the one<br/>exception of gese) is based on waterfall phenomena.&nbsp; In performance, the gulu<br/>or &lsquo;flow&rsquo; of gisalo has a rhythmic pulse of about one hundred and twenty<br/>beats per minute, which symbolically encapsulates the harmonious synchrony that<br/>exists between the Kaluli and their natural environment, and represented in<br/>this &lsquo;song and dance&rsquo; context by the dancer&rsquo;s &lsquo;wokwele (Giant Cuckoodove)<br/>bird-derived&rsquo; up and down movements, and waterfall sound and motion.</p><p>ADRIAN PERTOUT<br/>&apos;Mixdown&apos; Monthly ~ Issue #75, July 5, 2000<br/>BEAT MAGAZINE PTY LTD<br/>All rights reserved.

The men&rsquo;s religious songs are often accompanied<br/>rhythmically by banja (clapsticks, either struck together or split at the ends to<br/>be played on a log), and hunting and gathering songs (especially honey songs)<br/>alternatively by ngbenbe (clapsticks, stripped of bark), with the occasional<br/>inclusion of externally appropriated membranophones. The molimo trumpet is<br/>considered as a sacred object of the molimo ceremony, and makata (tuned sticks,<br/>discarded after their use) belong to the tradition of the Bantu village nkumbi<br/>initiation ceremony, whereas the flute (end-blown reed or cane notched<br/>aerophone), lukembi (10-key lamellaphone or mbira) and musical bow have a secular<br/>recreational standing.<br/>    The songs of the Mbuti pygmies are constructed around pentatonic and<br/>quasipentatonic melodic frameworks of notably descending contours that are given<br/>life with a harmonic idiosyncrasy based on fourths and fifths, multi-part<br/>vocalization, polyrhythmic aptitude and improvisational propagation.&nbsp; Textual<br/>material is unimportant, with the &lsquo;importance&rsquo; and &lsquo;power&rsquo; of the song entirely<br/>based on the constraints of sound.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mbuti sing using four basic vowel sounds<br/>(ee, eh, oh, oo).&nbsp; They also use effects achieved by holding the nose, or<br/>singing from the throat or the stomach,&rdquo; explains Colin Turnbull in the liner notes<br/>of Mbuti Pygmies of the Ituri Rainforest.&nbsp; In the actual performance context,<br/>the antiphonal singing techniques of the female-led songs of the elima<br/>initiation ceremony, and the hocket singing techniques utilized in the canonic<br/>hunting songs further illustrate both the sound of the music, and the affinity<br/>between songs and the patterns of cooperation manifested within the social<br/>structure.<br/>    The Mbuti, referred to as BaMbuti (the generic term for all pygmies of<br/>the Ituri forest) by the Bantu and Sudanic villagers that surround their forest<br/>environment, represent one of two major groups of pygmies that inhabit the<br/>Congo basin, and although participate in some of the village ceremonies to<br/>appease the socio-economic relationship with the villagers, their own sacred rituals<br/>are reserved for the forest.&nbsp; The most important of these is the molimo,<br/>which may be characterized in its two existing forms of the molimo mangbo or<br/>&lsquo;great&rsquo; molimo that is usually brought about by the event of death (but may also<br/>include adult disputes, bad hunting, illicit flirtation or adultery) is where<br/>the elders, adults and youth sing every night for at least a month, and the<br/>molimo made or &lsquo;lesser&rsquo; molimo that is brought about by everyday akami &lsquo;noise&rsquo;<br/>(or conflict) in the camp.&nbsp; The faith in the great power of the molimo is<br/>embodied in the ideology that here is an opportunity to resolve problems directly<br/>with the &lsquo;supreme being&rsquo; (the spirit of the forest conceptualized as virtually<br/>the panacea), and that once song becomes sanctified with the combined force<br/>of the unmarried (and also pure) youth&rsquo;s voices and the molimo trumpet, song<br/>then has the ability to communicate with the forest and therefore &lsquo;wake up the<br/>forest&rsquo; to ultimately have ekimi &lsquo;peace&rsquo; restored.&nbsp; The youth duplicate the<br/>angry sounds of leopards and elephants (and if necessary the actions), and<br/>sleepless night after sleepless night they echo the songs of the adults, and when<br/>song achieves the kind of attributes capable of reaching the spirit of the<br/>forest, peace is finally reconstituted.&nbsp; In an article titled Liminality: A<br/>Synthesis of Subjective and Objective Experience Colin Turnbull notes, &ldquo;The Mbuti<br/>would say that those who do not recognize spirit have merely forgotten (or never<br/>knew) how to reach it: &lsquo;they do not know how to sing.&rsquo;&nbsp; Other cultures have<br/>other ways of making contact with spirit, but for the Mbuti their prime,<br/>supreme way, is song.&rdquo;</p><p>ADRIAN PERTOUT<br/>&apos;Mixdown&apos; Monthly ~ Issue #84, April 4, 2001<br/>BEAT MAGAZINE PTY LTD<br/>All rights reserved.

&ldquo;The souls of all entities are dialectically<br/>differentiated into upper and lower portions.&nbsp; Humans have head- and<br/>heart-souls; plants have leaf- and root-souls; mountains have summit- and underground-<br/>or cave-souls,&rdquo; explains Marina Roseman in an article titled The Social<br/>Structuring of Sound: The Temiar of Peninsular Malaysia.&nbsp; The benevolent and<br/>malevolent nature of these opposing forces thus creates an environment that is both<br/>positive and negative, and one that the Temiar attempt to control through<br/>dream and trance.&nbsp; A result of this interactive cosmological viewpoint is the<br/>communicative link between human and non-human entities, which is directly<br/>responsible for their musical and therapeutic benefaction.<br/>    The majority of Temiar music is vocal, which is accompanied by<br/>bamboo-tube stampers (gooh), and on occasions either by one or two single-headed drums<br/>(barano and batak), and/or a small hand-held gong, and is a prominent feature<br/>of night ceremonies.&nbsp; Instrumental forms alternatively dominate the day (a<br/>disruption of this cosmic order perceived to bring illness and death to the<br/>community), and the instruments utilized include the pensool (nose flute), siooy<br/>(mouth-blown flute), gengoon (metal Jew&rsquo;s harp), rangon rangon (palm Jew&rsquo;s harp)<br/>and karab (two-stringed bamboo-tube zither).&nbsp; The bamboo instruments are<br/>reserved for women (notable are the bamboo-tube stampers that accompany all<br/>singing with their distinctive duple rhythm), while the Jew&rsquo;s harps for men, with<br/>the flutes in the dominion of either gender.<br/>    The acquisition of all Temiar vocal repertoire is perpetuated within the<br/>dream paradigm, and in a process that involves the unbound head-soul (rawaay)<br/>spirit of the dreamer meeting with the upper- or lower-portion souls of<br/>entities (such as trees, river rapids, tigers and deceased humans), who upon<br/>declaring to become their spiritguide (gonig) bestow songs upon them.&nbsp; In the<br/>ceremonial performance setting that follows, the spiritual link effectually<br/>transforms the dreamer into a medium of the spiritguide, acquiring its voice, vision<br/>and knowledge, hence the adeptness as healer.&nbsp; The melodies of the nose flute<br/>and end-blown flute repertoires are directly procured from these songs, with<br/>those of the Jew&rsquo;s harps and zither alternatively mimicking the sounds of the<br/>natural forest environment (birdcalls, insect sounds, et cetera).&nbsp; &ldquo;Temiar<br/>singing and religion receive inspiration and constant regeneration from interactions<br/>with the essences of mountains, rivers, fruits, creatures of the tropical<br/>rainforest,&rdquo; explains Marina Roseman.<br/>    This unique ability to receive songs from spiritguides (and therefore the<br/>ability to present the spiritguides through the performance of these songs)<br/>is considered to render a person with halaa or &lsquo;adeptness&rsquo;.&nbsp; Women are less<br/>likely to attain the status of halaa, although are an essential component of the<br/>performance of songs, and feature prominently within the social sphere as<br/>midwives.&nbsp; &ldquo;Halaa adeptness enables an individual to diagnose and treat<br/>illness,&rdquo; notes Marina Roseman.&nbsp; Greater the quantity and period of song acquisition,<br/>greater the halaa, with the procurement of the revered tiger spiritguide<br/>crystallize the social standing of halaa manuu or &lsquo;larger&rsquo; medium.&nbsp;  Adeptness may<br/>be also acquired from other mediums, and close relations are often initiated<br/>as mediums, in a ceremonial process that involves the reception of<br/>ministrations (parenlub).&nbsp; In the spiritually dynamic event of parenlub, the medium&rsquo;s<br/>entire repertoire is transmitted from the spiritguide into the head- and<br/>heart-soul of the person with the aid of kahyek (a cool spiritual liquid).&nbsp; Marina<br/>Roseman explains, &ldquo;The cool spiritual liquid kahyek combines the essence of<br/>foliage (sap), rivers, rain, and dew-valuing water and coolness.&nbsp; Kahyek is the<br/>liquid form of the upper-portion souls of nonhuman entities; but when unbound and<br/>flowing in the contexts of trance, singing-sessions, and curing, this cool<br/>spiritual liquid can be transferred and infused into humans.&rdquo;&nbsp; A person that<br/>circumvents parenlub is not considered a medium, and additionally the act of<br/>singing dream songs of other people is not considered as possessing halaa, because<br/>these songs are decreed as to bar-is ii or &lsquo;without substance&rsquo;.<br/>    The therapeutic nature of Temiar music and its incontrovertible emphasis<br/>on the hypothesis of non or &lsquo;path&rsquo; is highlighted in the course of<br/>singing/trance-dancing ceremonies.&nbsp; In the same way that survival in the jungle is<br/>perceived to be dependent on the ability to &lsquo;negotiate the path&rsquo; (an aptitude<br/>equated with the possession of all necessary universal knowledge), survival in the<br/>settlement is also perceived to be governed by similar cosmology, therefore<br/>leading to the philosophical deduction that considers illness to be the result<br/>of a person&rsquo;s detached head-soul getting lost or waylaid.&nbsp; Temiar mediums sing<br/>during curing ceremonies, and the melodic and textual material utilized in<br/>these songs are a bestowal of spirit guides in dreams.&nbsp; In the performance<br/>context of these &lsquo;dream songs&rsquo; the women&rsquo;s chorus repeat the medium&rsquo;s phrases,<br/>which metaphorically represents &lsquo;following the path described by the spiritguide<br/>through the medium&rsquo;.&nbsp; According to Marina Roseman in Healing Sounds from the<br/>Malaysian Rainforest: Temiar Music and Medicine, &ldquo;Songs are paths that link<br/>mediums, female chorus members, trance-dancers, and patients with spirits of the<br/>jungle and settlement.&rdquo;</p><p>ADRIAN PERTOUT<br/>&apos;Mixdown&apos;
