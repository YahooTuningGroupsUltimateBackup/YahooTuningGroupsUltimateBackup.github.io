There, the chords are JI but the<br/>melodies are not.  Adaptive temperament is where both chords<br/>and melody are tempered [though not all authors support this<br/>distinction, &quot;adaptive JI&quot; always includes what you&apos;re doing<br/>here].  To make matters confusing, Bill Sethares uses the<br/>term &quot;adaptive tuning&quot; for the thing where timbre and tuning<br/>are matched.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
