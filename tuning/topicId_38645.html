Julia has been quite direct in dealing with it, but<br/>you seem to be suffering moreso.  I understand your criticisms of me for<br/>having a different point of view.  But I don&apos;t truly deserve to have my name<br/>in the subject all the time, whether you are speaking to me (of me?) or not.</p><p>&gt; My doubts about it not making a difference were said in all<br/>&gt; seriousness, not in jest, nor to be sarcastic. The negativity in<br/>&gt; the criticisms of Julia Werntz have past the point of no return.</p><p>Julia Werntz is a published writer.  Who are you, Joel, to determine how of<br/>if any criticisms can be engendered?  Isn&apos;t that the nature of published work<br/>in music?  My criticisms were centered on what I found to be naive.  Frankly,<br/>you are a bit naive yourself.  We are all naive in different areas, in<br/>different subjects.  You called me pompous and then said I refuse to accept<br/>criticism.  Please feel free to criticize me, though if you prefer personal<br/>items, it really is better form to use private mail.  There are others on<br/>this List that will use private mail FIRST before posting general poobah to<br/>the list about an individual.</p><p>&gt; I also never intended any insult or hurtfulness toward you. I<br/>&gt; sincerely feel I made a fair comment on your posts about Julia.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Joel, you have said this several time now  And you have quoted what came<br/>before this twice now ( so I have not reiterated it ).  I accept your insults<br/>and turn the other cheek.  When I read Julia&apos;s work I did not want to respond<br/>to it.  As hurtful as it might be, I was enjoined to respond.  And blamo,<br/>there is this reaction.  So be it.</p><p>&gt; As far as lessons in graciousness, read Julia&apos;s responses to<br/>&gt; this forum. Read Margo&apos;s posts referring to Julia. That is<br/>&gt; graciousness. Then look at the nature of the posts from other<br/>&gt; quarters. If one were to simply list the names she&apos;s been<br/>&gt; called, it is disgraceful.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It is grossly unfair to tie me in to anyone else&apos;s views.  This is<br/>unacceptable for it is intellectually dishonest.</p><p>When I asked you to teach graciousness, I confess, I was extremely sarcastic.<br/> For graciousness we easily have a model in Margo&apos;s post.  Alas, we are all<br/>different people on this list.  And if you refuse to recognize that many<br/>different people disagree with SOME of Julia&apos;s points in her writings, well,<br/>it&apos;s tough cookies.</p><p>&gt; One. Just one lone voice saying he agrees with Julia and<br/>&gt; disagrees with your critiques, and look at the reaction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sincerely,<br/>&gt; Joel<br/>&gt;</p><p>You cut quite the romantic figure, sort of the Zorro defending the honor of a<br/>fair damsal in distress.  Would you consider sending me a little bio to me<br/>privately, so that I can fully appreciate your life&apos;s work in music?</p><p>Sincerely, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Joel Rodrigues &#x3C;joelrodrigues@mac.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2002 12:07:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Dear Joel and others,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m afraid that Joel, you are combining all the criticisms into &gt; one huge<br/>&gt; criticism and you hurt...</p><p>etc.<br/>...</p><p>&gt; Sincerely, Johnny Reinhard</p><p>It&apos;s Rodrigues.
