Recently, I have become extremely<br/>&gt;interested in alternate tunings and their possibilities due to my<br/>&gt;discovery of the vast inadequacies of the ET system.  I am very new<br/>&gt;to this expansive field, and it is also quite difficult to decide<br/>&gt;which direction it is wise to take.  Overall, it is the pursuit for<br/>&gt;quality instead of quantity which guides me in my search.  It is also<br/>&gt;through the realization of the limitations placed on both myself and<br/>&gt;my music by the large corporations.  They have made it very difficult<br/>&gt;for anyone to have a real, individual identity due to the<br/>&gt;commerciality of the consumer market.  Musically, I wish to seek what<br/>&gt;is pure, and now I know that ET is not pure; it is biased.  It does<br/>&gt;not seem like JI is a set system.  It seems like JI has unlimited<br/>&gt;possibilities that is a matter of choice of will.  It all depends on<br/>&gt;how far I wish to go in exploring uncommon and, eventually, unknown<br/>&gt;regions in the future.<br/>&gt;    As of now, though, I am at the beginning.  All I have is ET<br/>&gt;system instrumentation.  I have found that a synthesizer is the best<br/>&gt;way to discover the rich possibilities of JI and any other tuning<br/>&gt;avenue imaginable.  Yet, I do not even know what a synthesizer looks<br/>&gt;like.  I have never found one which has the capabilities I am looking<br/>&gt;for.  I do not know how to find one.  I basically have no experience<br/>&gt;in this new field.  I was wondering if any of you have any helpful<br/>&gt;suggestions.  I would greatly appreciate it.  I search for something<br/>&gt;which is pure and rare to find, it seems.  I have always known that<br/>&gt;there has been something missing in the &quot;music&quot; that I have heard<br/>&gt;throughout my life.  Something which was arbitrary was placed<br/>&gt;subjectively there in order to please the masses.  I do not see how<br/>&gt;anyone, if they knew this, would ever like ET again.  The real ratios<br/>&gt;are what truly matters.  There are ways to get around<br/>&gt;the &quot;modulation&quot; problem.  It is not difficult.  It would only<br/>&gt;involve other methods that would be &quot;cumbersome&quot; to others at first.<br/>&gt;These methods would make real music much more complex, rich, and<br/>&gt;satisfying than anything previously applied.  Thank you for your time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sincerely,<br/>&gt;PageWizard</p><p>Welcome, PageWizard!  It sounds as if you might be describing adaptive<br/>tuning.  This is something I have dabbled in, though the field is<br/>absolutely wide open for innovation by anyone who enters.  My own work<br/>is described (with GM examples) at:</p><p>   <a href="http://www.adaptune.com">http://www.adaptune.com</a></p><p>(change to Studio J).</p><p>Look forward to hearing more about your ideas!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
