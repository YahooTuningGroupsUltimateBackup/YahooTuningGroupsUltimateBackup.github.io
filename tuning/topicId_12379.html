As an advocate of<br/>&quot;peace,&quot; I might well have sought with equal passion to promote the<br/>associated goal of &quot;understanding.&quot;</p><p>It was very clear to me from the thread that the &quot;JI&quot; pentatonic scale<br/>was intended to be 5-limit or higher, with 5:4 and 6:5 major thirds.<br/>As Paul correctly noted, defining the problem in this way, we run into<br/>the syntonic comma problem: four pure 3:2 fifths give an 81:64 major<br/>third (wider than 5:4 by the syntonic comma of 81:80, ~21.51 cents),<br/>while three such fifths give a 32:27 minor third (a syntonic comma<br/>narrower than 6:5).</p><p>However, taking this repartee somewhat in the style of a riddle, I<br/>seemed to notice that the discussion was simply of &quot;JI,&quot; not of<br/>&quot;5-limit or higher JI,&quot; although the reference to the syntonic comma<br/>as a problem made the 5-limit _assumptions_ very clear.</p><p>Since a lot of the dialogue seemed to concern categories and<br/>assumptions, I couldn&apos;t resist solving the &quot;riddle&quot; by suggesting that<br/>3-limit or Pythagorean tuning is also a kind of &quot;JI,&quot; and that here,<br/>of course, 81:64 and 32:27 thirds are a normal way of life, not a<br/>&quot;problem.&quot; Since pentatonic scales are often analyzed in terms of<br/>3-limit musics and tunings, the point seemed not so artificial to me.</p><p>However, if my purpose was to communicate these concepts, I might have<br/>done so more patiently and informatively, discussing the distinction<br/>between 3-limit and 5-limit JI, and also the common default assumption<br/>that &quot;JI&quot; implies &quot;5-limit or higher.&quot;</p><p>In a way, the repartee reminded me of a story about an astronomer who<br/>was told that a certain proposition would not be valid because there<br/>was one too few stars within a certain radius of earth. The astronomer<br/>(Pickering, as I recall) replied, &quot;But you&apos;re forgetting the sun!&quot;</p><p>In that case, as I recall (having read about it likely some 35 years<br/>ago), the omission of the sun may have really affected the<br/>astronomical issue in question. Here, of course, if the problem is to<br/>have a pentatonic scale with pure fifths _and_ 5:4 and 6:5 thirds,<br/>then the syntonic comma problem remains -- and pointing out that such<br/>a scale may also be tuned in 3-limit &quot;JI&quot; is more of a point of<br/>semantics or &quot;intonational politics,&quot; which is how I intended it.</p><p>However, if the point was worth making, it was worth making in a clear<br/>and educative manner. Repartee can be intoxicating, but adequate<br/>explanation more informative.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
