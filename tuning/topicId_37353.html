What I &quot;denounce&quot; in that particular quotation are the denunciations<br/>of non-just music made by many JI proponents. That&apos;s all. (And elsewhere in Part 1<br/>I also make theoretical and practical criticisms of the pure-tuning approach to<br/>music. ) I don&apos;t threaten anyone&apos;s free speech, or democracy itself, I just challenge<br/>what certain people say (and speeking freely). To some, believe it or not, it seems<br/>like certain pure-tuning diatribes like the ones I cite in PNM are intolerant and<br/>would restrict creative freedom.</p><p>Please, everyone who is concerned with this issue, make note of the following very<br/>important point, lest anyone succeed in portraying me as a tyrant: In Part 2 of the<br/>PNM essay the compositional suggestions I make are really mainly intended to<br/>interest those who already are inclined, on their own accord, to compose, totally<br/>free from pure tuning concerns, with functional microtonal equal temperaments.<br/>They are not intended for JI composers, who presumably believe in what they are<br/>doing, and for whom these suggestions would be irrelevant. In fact, I&apos;m certain the<br/>points in Part 2 would seem completely outrageous to most JI people. (As does,<br/>for example, Joe Maneri&apos;s book.)</p><p>In other words, the paper is not one message, stating &quot;Everyone must abandon<br/>just intonation, adopt a microtonal equal temperament, write atonally, and make<br/>use of microintervallic conjunct motion.&quot; The messages are two: in Part 1) &quot;Here<br/>are my criticisms of the pure tuning movement and my arguments in favor of<br/>microtonal equal temperaments,&quot; and in Part 2) &quot;Here are some suggestions for<br/>those who are unconcerned with pure tuning, and compose with microtonal equal<br/>temperaments.&quot;</p><p>There are a few such (impure) composers out there, for whom these points would<br/>be food for thought, but on the whole there hasn&apos;t been much communication and<br/>discourse amongst them about these issues, which deal with the craft of<br/>composing, especially when compared to the seemingly endless resources available<br/>to pure-tuning theorists and composers.</p><p>I never expected this essay to be popular with the pure-tuning crowd. Obviously.<br/>But I *am* interested to know their reactions to the points, especially in Part I. I<br/>criticized the very foundation of the pure-tuning approach to music, and am curious<br/>to hear back from people like you about the issues I raised in that part of the<br/>paper. Even when I disagree, I do like it when people believe very strongly what<br/>they believe. I thrive on plurality, despite what you, Mark Gould, seem to want to<br/>make people think.</p><p>If you, other readers, care about the other nit-picking details, then read on...</p><p>&gt;Werntz suggests a serial approach: and her techniques reveal it. Werntz is<br/>&gt;thus serial.</p><p>This equation doesn&apos;t quite work.</p><p>I &quot;suggest,&quot; in that I give hypothetical examples of how a serialist (someone else)<br/>could make use of the general approach to microtonality outlined in Part 2 of the<br/>paper. (This does not make Werntz serial. Not that Werntz has any problem with<br/>serialism.) In addition, I show how I have used some motivic sets in the first<br/>movement of my string trio. The way I use them, we could also call them, simply,<br/>&quot;motives.&quot; Many serious serial composers probably wouldn&apos;t say that this qualifies<br/>as serialism, because my treatment of them is too free. But definitions do vary,<br/>and if it&apos;s serialism to you, then fine. It&apos;s not serialism to me.</p><p>&gt;And the serialism proposed is thus more artificial than any JI<br/>&gt;scheme suggested, as it has no basis in any connection of tones at all.</p><p>Do you care to explain this, or does this statement suit you just fine as it is? I seem<br/>to remember writing at length about voice-leading (i.e. the connection of tones), in<br/>those same pages.</p><p>&gt;Maneri&apos;s technique hovers about tones, giving them temporal emphasis - this<br/>&gt;is a &apos;tonal&apos; technique as it does not destroy the sense of tonal polarity.</p><p>It&apos;s true that I describe Maneri&apos;s emphasis of certain tones through a sort of<br/>&quot;hovering.&quot; The final section of my essay, which you are referring to, is devoted to<br/>these emphasized pitches, and that is where I speculate about parallels with<br/>diatonic, music. If the existence of emphasized pitches is *synonymous* with<br/>tonality for you, that&apos;s fine too. This is another word with multiple interpretations.<br/>Maybe I prefer your &quot;tonal polarity.&quot; This would be a more apt term for what I<br/>describe in those pages.</p><p>&gt; What I really do in my paper is to advocate a few<br/>&gt; specific things, for example microtonal equal temperaments in general, an<br/>&gt; &quot;atonal&quot;<br/>&gt; approach (even though I dislike that word), and something I call, for fun,<br/>&gt; &quot;atwelvetonality&quot;</p><p>&gt;If that is not serialism,    then I have been misled,</p><p>You have been misled. Who told you that equal temperament and atonality equal<br/>serialism? Not George Perle! (And I&apos;m sure he never told you anything about<br/>&quot;atwelvetonality.&quot;)</p><p>&gt;I find it both sad and unfortunate that the statements I make are &apos;absurd&apos;,<br/>&gt;when they are logically true. These are not opinions, but statements of<br/>&gt;fact.</p><p>They are mistakes, presumptions you have made. If you want to be qualified to<br/>speak about my music, or Maneri&apos;s, or anyone else&apos;s, then get yourself some<br/>scores and study them first.</p><p>&gt;&quot;One is compelled to wonder whay a composer could not just side-step the theory<br/>&gt;and access these new pitches more directly through some sort of system that<br/>&gt;provides, ready made,t he sixth tones, quarter tones, etc. that help make these<br/>&gt;pieces interesting - as microtonal equal temperaments do.&quot;</p><p>&gt;maybe they didn&apos;t want the pitches of the equal temperaments.</p><p>Fair enough.</p><p>&gt;12EDO is artifical, as is any other. Music written using such is not<br/>&gt;artificial, but its components tend toward an inner truth, whose realization<br/>&gt;at the hands of good performers will lead away from 12EDO.</p><p>For some, like you, that &quot;inner truth&quot; is scientific nature. For others, like me, that<br/>&quot;inner truth&quot; is human nature - even when it doesn&apos;t sync with science, as in the<br/>example of some types of equal temperaments. This is closer to the crux of the<br/>issue, for me. (By the way, the language in the paper makes it clear that most of<br/>Part 1 is intended as my opinion, not as fact. What I do state as fact is... that it&apos;s<br/>*not* a fact that everyone perceives consonance and<br/>dissonance in the same way, because of several variables which I outline.)</p><p>Some of us may be led away from 12-note equal temperament, not in the direction<br/>of pure tuning, but to other divisions of their own or others&apos; invention, including<br/>the ones that for you seem artificial and arbitrary.</p><p>&gt;I find it irritating to think that a composer would choose a set of<br/>&gt;divisions over a selection of tones whose derivation may be mathematical,<br/>&gt;but grows from the very nature of the tone.</p><p>I&apos;m never irritated by the means other composers choose to reach their ends.<br/>That&apos;s a very personal issue. But I am sometimes irritated by their (or theorist&apos;s)<br/>careless proclamations, which is why I wrote what I wrote in Part 1 of my essay.</p><p>&gt;I am sorry, but I will not fetter the imagination merely to satisfy an arbitrary<br/>&gt;requirement.</p><p>I don&apos;t remember requiring you, or anyone else, to do anything.</p><p>&gt;Do you have the courage not just to be challenged, but to be proved wrong?<br/>&gt;and the courage to accept it?</p><p>Please restrain yourself.</p></div><h3><a id=37357 href="#37357">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2002 5:52:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jwerntz2002&quot; &lt;juliawerntz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I never expected this essay to be popular with the pure-tuning crowd.
