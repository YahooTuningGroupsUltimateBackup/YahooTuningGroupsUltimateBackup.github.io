I just<br/>got done spending $2500 to upgrade my alto saxophone.  Without a doubt<br/>though, the distinction between the older and upgraded instruments is<br/>beyond the capabilities of even a fairly sophisticated sampling machine to<br/>faithfully reproduce.  $2500 for something pretty far down in the realm of<br/>sublties.  Musicians are a really picky lot.</p><p>   As I&apos;m fond of pointing out, when you go from analog synthesis to<br/>additive or sampling, you also go from what our ears perceive as impressive<br/>imitations to really awful-sounding real instruments.  So even though in<br/>every clearly-perceptible and measurable way, there is no doubt that the<br/>simulation is more accurate, we&apos;ve unwittingly hiked the standard by which<br/>it&apos;s being judged by an order of magnitude.</p><p>   Believability is also based upon the listeners&apos; backgrounds:  Many<br/>people have vastly more discriminating hearing than the depth of their<br/>experience with certain instruments.  Often peoples&apos; beliefs as to what a<br/>certain instrument sounds like isn&apos;t really what they actually sound like.<br/>As an example, the recorder simulations in my contribution to the<br/>tuning-list CD, which at least one person thought didn&apos;t think sounded very<br/>good, are really pretty darned accurate in side-by-side comparisons to the<br/>instruments they were sampled from.  They accurately simulate different<br/>attack hardnesses, slurred vs. tongued attacks, what aspects of the tone<br/>vibrato modulates, noise components in the sound, different timbral<br/>registers, volume/timbre correlations, and of course the differences<br/>between the soprano, tenor (and the others).  There were two problems<br/>though:</p><p>  1. They weren&apos;t exactly perfect, and as such they became an insult to a<br/>     recorder-fan.<br/>  2. My performance is was stiff and unanimated, mostly because I didn&apos;t<br/>     have my WX-11 working at the time, so I performed them from the<br/>     keyboard, which I quite simply can&apos;t play.</p><p>   Along those lines, I&apos;ve also concluded that, if you&apos;re going to simulate<br/>a &quot;real&quot;-instrument ensemble, you&apos;re best off sticking with ensembles<br/>people are familiar with, and not tell them that they&apos;re a simulation.  In<br/>one of my compositions, some people told me that the strings sounded<br/>fakey.  In all honesty, they were right;  partly because of bad source<br/>sample material.  But I was kinda freaked out to find that, for at least<br/>one of these people, it turned out to be because he was trying to liken<br/>them to the sound of an entire string section rather than individual solo<br/>violin, viola, and &apos;cello!  He didn&apos;t have any real listening experience<br/>with individual orchestral stringed instruments.</p><p>   On my ASR-10, I&apos;ve produced a number of instrument simulations, and<br/>those simulations have improved (most of the improved ones I haven&apos;t<br/>recorded anything with yet).  But one thing&apos;s for sure:  if it&apos;s<br/>sufficiently accurate, people will judge you against a much higher standard<br/>than if it&apos;s a &quot;cartoon&quot;, to use W. Carlos&apos; phraseology.</p></div>
