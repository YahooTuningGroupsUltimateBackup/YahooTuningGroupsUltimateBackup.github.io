Even<br/>if I don&apos;t possess a specially 19-tet fretted guitar I could easily tune the<br/>exact positions on my guitar with moveable frets.  It&apos;s a charming little<br/>piece and a very good example of 19-tet.</p><p>The music, in SimpleSound &quot;music quality&quot; format, and the score (JPG) only<br/>take 1100 Ko all together in compressed form. Anyone who is interested in it<br/>and would like to receive it can just send me an empty E-mail. Sunday at<br/>midnight CET I&apos;ll push the button and send the same  recording and  score to<br/>everybody in the same time.</p><p>This is an experiment for me!</p><p>--Wim</p></div>
