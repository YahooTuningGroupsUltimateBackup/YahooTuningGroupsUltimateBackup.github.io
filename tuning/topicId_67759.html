It sounds great to me, and I will again assert<br/>that I&apos;m PROVING that issues about comma shift are only contextual and<br/>depend on how they are used.  Furthermore, comma shift is completely<br/>an issue of expectation and what you are used to.</p><p>If you have a system for understanding the value and effect of the<br/>shift, it sounds totally normal.  We all know that voices shift<br/>around, so that doesn&apos;t sound weird.  I think the &quot;weirdness&quot; people<br/>talk of in comma shifts is the same mental affect as hearing a symbol<br/>pitch bend or hearing a piano suddenly crescendo a note.  It&apos;s a<br/>congnitive dissonance issue.  For many, hearing that shift sounds<br/>unnatural and breaks the mold of their understanding of how the world<br/>works.</p><p>In other words, comma shift in itself is not a problem at all.  But<br/>inserting comma shifts into piano pieces by Chopan IS, because that<br/>isn&apos;t the way the piano or those pieces work.  Shifting in vocals is<br/>so normal that most people barely notice that my recordings aren&apos;t<br/>totally normal, except for maybe sounding a little &quot;edited.&quot;</p><p>Listen for yourself.  Here&apos;s the latest one, and again, if we learn<br/>from this and THEN re-record, it could be significantly better than<br/>this even.</p><p>mix:<br/><a href="http://www.ozmusic.com/aaron/mp3/WMeetAgain/WMeetAgain.mp3">http://www.ozmusic.com/aaron/mp3/WMeetAgain/WMeetAgain.mp3</a></p><p>Parts:<br/><a href="http://ozmusic.com/aaron/mp3/WMeetAgain/WMeetAgain_BARI.mp3">http://ozmusic.com/aaron/mp3/WMeetAgain/WMeetAgain_BARI.mp3</a><br/><a href="http://www.ozmusic.com/aaron/mp3/WMeetAgain/WMeetAgain_BASS.mp3">http://www.ozmusic.com/aaron/mp3/WMeetAgain/WMeetAgain_BASS.mp3</a><br/><a href="http://www.ozmusic.com/aaron/mp3/WMeetAgain/WMeetAgain_LEAD.mp3">http://www.ozmusic.com/aaron/mp3/WMeetAgain/WMeetAgain_LEAD.mp3</a><br/><a href="http://www.ozmusic.com/aaron/mp3/WMeetAgain/WMeetAgain_TENOR.mp3">http://www.ozmusic.com/aaron/mp3/WMeetAgain/WMeetAgain_TENOR.mp3</a></p><p>In Harmony,<br/>Aaron Wolf</p><p>P.S. as to the specifics of this piece, there is one augmented chord<br/>that occurs a couple times and I don&apos;t like it much, but couldn&apos;t<br/>easily come up with a better arrangement, and so I just stuck with it<br/>for here.  But other than that, I think this arrangement works great.<br/> There are a lot of &quot;dips&quot; where the whole chord just goes down and<br/>back up, and they could have been ANY amount desired, because the<br/>effect is the dip, and it has no other harmonic function.</p></div><h3>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2006 8:17:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; around, so that doesn&apos;t sound weird.

Dotted lines make a good nearly, with perhaps a plus<br/>or minus sign above them to indicate direction.</p><p>That takes care of shifts.  Drift I think is best shown as a<br/>cumulative cents offset from concert pitch.  Every time the<br/>offset changes direction -- say it&apos;s been going flat and<br/>starts going sharp -- the current offset should be printed<br/>above the barline.  Say we start out at A=440, go 20 cents<br/>flat every other bar for 5 bars, then go 20 cents sharp every<br/>other bar for 5 bars and end on A=440.  The notation would<br/>show &quot;-100&quot; above the 6th barline and &quot;+-0&quot; above the last<br/>barline.  The point is that this is something that should<br/>happen naturally if one tunes pure and respects the shifts<br/>notation (above).  It&apos;s just there as a check so you can<br/>troubleshoot whether you&apos;re going flat &apos;cause you&apos;re tired<br/>or because the composer/arranger intended it.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/24/2006 10:04:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote...]<br/>&gt; Just take this example:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/music/score/Retrofit_JI.pdf">http://lumma.org/music/score/Retrofit_JI.pdf</a><br/>&gt; (this is 4MB, might take a while to load)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a formative showing of the notation I suggested in my<br/>&gt; previous message, but I haven&apos;t gone through and made sure<br/>&gt; the commas don&apos;t accumulate.

Everything you are talking about<br/>comes from the world of POLYPHONY.  When everyone is concerned about<br/>what their particular part is, then your points make sense.  And even<br/>in barbershop there is definitely a bit of that.  However,<br/>barbershoppers do best when they hear themselves as part of a whole.</p><p>Put further, woodshedders historically were concerned first with what<br/>the root harmonic movement was and secondly with simply whether they<br/>were staying on a note or moving.  But whether they move a third or<br/>fifth isn&apos;t important, but what place they have in the new chord.</p><p>Watch Dave Steven&apos;s &quot;What Are We Trying To Preserve&quot; at <a href="http://barbershop.org">barbershop.org</a><br/>for a very wonderful entertaining presentation:</p><p>&lt;a<br/>href=&quot;<a href="http://stellent.spebsqsa.org/web/groups/public/documents/native/cb_00083.ram">http://stellent.spebsqsa.org/web/groups/public/documents/native/cb_00083.ram</a>&quot;&gt;What<br/>Are We Trying To Preserve&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>He discusses a system used by the old folks who did not read music:</p><p>They basically used a system to say that the chord was &quot;home&quot; or 1, 2,<br/>3, or 4 away on the 5ths-system (meaning 3 identities).  They just<br/>held up 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 fingers, and everyone knew what that chord<br/>sounded like and found a note that fit into that chord.</p><p>That is a great way to work when working in a style which is totally<br/>based around those progressions.</p><p>My concept is to get away from everyone treating their own part as the<br/>focus and go toward listening to the unified result of all the parts.</p><p>Anyway, recognizing that different sorts of music work differently, I<br/>feel pretty confident that identifying the root of each chord is<br/>extremely useful in barbershop specifically.

Then use different note heads to simply indicate a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3, 5, 7 etc identity in relation to the fundamental.  If that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; could be combined with a very simple indication of melodic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; comma shifts (no need to specify different commas), that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; should cover everything.  What do you think?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Sounds good, except I don&apos;t like the part about the fundamental&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; absolute pitch.  First off, what happens if it isn&apos;t a power<br/>&gt;&gt; of 3?  Secondly, I don&apos;t think performers (or composers) need<br/>&gt;&gt; to know this.  There&apos;s no way a bass is going to be able to say,<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;Oh, 3129/8080, I was a bit flat there, wasn&apos;t I?&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Performers are more likely to be interested in which note<br/>&gt;&gt; remain unchanged or nearly unchanged between chords.  They<br/>&gt;&gt; can then tune pure to it/them.  For nearly unchanged notes,<br/>&gt;&gt; yes I agree plenty of mileage could be gotten out of only one<br/>&gt;&gt; type of &quot;nearly&quot;.  I like drawing lines to make the common<br/>&gt;&gt; tones obvious.  Then one doesn&apos;t even have to read music (or<br/>&gt;&gt; both clefs) to know that he&apos;s got to match the bari&apos;s previous<br/>&gt;&gt; pitch.  Dotted lines make a good nearly, with perhaps a plus<br/>&gt;&gt; or minus sign above them to indicate direction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Carl,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like a lot of your ideas, but we always need to remember<br/>&gt; what the mindset of a stylistic performer is. ... When<br/>&gt; everyone is concerned about what their particular part is,<br/>&gt; then your points make sense. ... woodshedders historically<br/>&gt; were concerned first with what the root harmonic movement<br/>&gt; was and secondly with simply whether they were staying on<br/>&gt; a note or moving.  But whether they move a third or fifth<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t important, but what place they have in the new chord.</p><p>Hi Aaron,</p><p>There&apos;s obviously a disconnect somewhere, because you seem<br/>to be agreeing with what I said!</p><p>&gt; He discusses a system used by the old folks who did not read<br/>&gt; music:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They basically used a system to say that the chord was &quot;home&quot;<br/>&gt; or 1, 2, 3, or 4 away on the 5ths-system (meaning 3 identities).<br/>//<br/>&gt; That is a great way to work when working in a style which is totally<br/>&gt; based around those progressions.</p><p>Exactly.  And not a good way for music that isn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; My concept is to get away from everyone treating their own part<br/>&gt; as the focus and go toward listening to the unified result of all<br/>&gt; the parts.</p><p>Such a focus would tend to come from a notation that emphasized<br/>absolute pitch, would it not?  And be discouraged by one that<br/>emphasized vertical harmony?</p><p>&gt; Anyway, recognizing that different sorts of music work<br/>&gt; differently, I feel pretty confident that identifying the<br/>&gt; root of each chord is extremely useful in barbershop<br/>&gt; specifically.</p><p>That&apos;s why the notation I suggested labels all the roots in<br/>the music.</p><p>&gt; Just because<br/>&gt; classical singers are so polyphonically focused and don&apos;t listen to<br/>&gt; each other doesn&apos;t mean I should compromise my notation to fit that<br/>&gt; mindset.</p><p>Where did you get this from?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/2006 2:17:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl,</p><p>I didn&apos;t mean to come off strongly.

If the person has only<br/>a vague idea in their head what the tonic sounded like when we are on<br/>another chord, then that&apos;s different from a situation in which the<br/>listener totally feels how the chord relates to a tonic firmly remembered.</p><p>How far away notes are, what the listener&apos;s background is, what their<br/>pre-conception of the style is, etc etc all effect this.

Certainly memory plays a<br/>big part in relating musical events to each other.  It is possible to<br/>listen to a piece and use only short term memory and listen just one<br/>instant to another.  It is also possible to remember whole sections<br/>and themes and relate them to parts heard much later.  There is no<br/>wrong way to listen.  In barbershop, I feel most singers and most<br/>listeners are likely able to keep track of tonic, because the style<br/>doesn&apos;t stray too far for too long.  But again, there&apos;s a range of<br/>sensitivity to that from person to person.</p><p>This sort of discussion even leads towards saying that since most<br/>listeners will follow words and facial expressions, exact pitch and<br/>blend aren&apos;t even the important thing in barbershop.  Point is,<br/>there&apos;s a lot of artistic decisions and opinions here.</p><p>As for other styles of music, if a barbershopper listens to rock with<br/>a barbershop attitude, they&apos;ll focus on totally different things than<br/>a rock listener who&apos;s focus is dancing and moshing.  I&apos;d say that<br/>outside of extremely obvious stuff, there&apos;s a HUGE range of pitch<br/>relations that are vague enough but not so vague, and the result is<br/>that there&apos;s a WIDE distribution of how much different listeners are<br/>able to follow and use their short term memory to relate things.</p><p>Once we go to music that is adventurous enough that no audience exists<br/>that really understands it and is used to it, then we are on totally<br/>different terms as far as how much relation and memory they can<br/>functionally and make sense of.</p><p>One more perspective: many listeners of temperament, I&apos;ve found, feel<br/>weird listening to other tunings because they don&apos;t have a way to<br/>relate the tones to others.  This is both trained and less trained<br/>musicians.  But after being showed a way to understand the<br/>relationships, it then becomes very easy to hear.</p><p>It&apos;s like language:  Some barbershoppers are able to appreciate the<br/>difference between many subtle pronunciation options.  Others simply<br/>want clear choices: &quot;Is it an AH or an AW?&quot;  After focusing on these<br/>things, some will hear a performance and be annoyed that the vowel was<br/>hard to identify, and others will not care or even have thought that<br/>way.  And lots more perspectives.  And these all have real impact on<br/>the listener&apos;s experience of the music.</p><p>So it&apos;s very complicated.  And I&apos;m arguing that barbershoppers can and<br/>do learn to relate pythagorean chords to the tonic within a normal,<br/>not excessively challenging barbershop style.  I never said anything<br/>about that relating to another style.  But if the notation exists and<br/>doesn&apos;t apply to some other style, then you can leave that part out.</p><p>I do want to find perhaps a better more accessible notation than<br/>either 27/16 or 3^3.  Some have proposed the clock system, meaning an<br/>actual little clock symbol that would show 3:00...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t tell them what frequency that has to be, but I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; sticking with the generally accepted idea that it shouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; generally change throughout the song (in other words, no<br/>&gt; &gt; overall tonic drift).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is that generally accepted?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>It is generally accepted within the ranks of anyone who cares to focus<br/>on the pitch content of the style.  To a degree, everyone accepts<br/>exceptions.  But my experience is very much that barbershoppers don&apos;t<br/>want to hear a short progression go flat.  Some like the sound of<br/>going sharp.  In the end, it does relate to the specific content of<br/>the music and whether that effect enhances the piece or not.  But as a<br/>general guideline, I&apos;ve heard very little argument against the goal of<br/>maintaining tonal center throughout a song.  And I&apos;ve heard a lot of<br/>barbershoppers do a good job staying on a tonal center over a long song.</p><p>In fact, this relates to my entire post.  Memory of tonal center is<br/>often so strong that messed up chords that weren&apos;t learned well can<br/>have a whole section sound all wrong and yet when it gets back to<br/>tonic everyone sort says &quot;oh yeah, well, I remember what tonic was&quot;<br/>and things get back on track.  If such memory were not at play, this<br/>would not be possible.  I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard the same thing.  Any<br/>good musician can even do this with tempo to a degree.  You could play<br/>a steady tempo and then go totally free and then instantly go back to<br/>tempo and be pretty damn close if you are any good.  Memory is a huge<br/>part of music and it spans a lot more than note-to-note.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2006 2:35:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PS- I don&apos;t mean to be obtuse.

I think I&apos;d prefer exponents though<br/>&gt; for readability, e.g. 3^3 rather than 27/16 (I think that&apos;s<br/>&gt; what you were suggesting anyway).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * Of course Harrison also composed in something he called<br/>&gt; &quot;Free Style&quot; which is closer to &quot;adaptive JI&quot; in spirit.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for clarifying.  Sorry for the length of my other post, though<br/>I don&apos;t regret any of the content.</p><p>I would prefer 3^3 for many reasons over 27/16.</p><p>I&apos;m familiar with the idea of 27/16 as an absolute pitch to a set 1/1.<br/> I guess I see what you mean about &quot;absolute&quot; but technically<br/>&quot;absolute&quot; usually means A440 as opposed to A441 or A438.94.  It means<br/>absolute in the sense of truly absolute.  And I&apos;ve never said anything<br/>about that.</p><p>I AM suggesting that in barbershop (and other styles such as doo-wop<br/>or blues and many others that have common progressions throughout the<br/>whole style) absolute relations to 1/1 aren&apos;t out of the question.<br/>What I&apos;m showing in my whole part tape thing is that vague &quot;adaptive<br/>JI&quot; is only one possible way to do barbershop.  I think such<br/>adaptativeness is not unnatural or wrong, but I think it happens<br/>primarily because of conflicting teachings about how barbershop should<br/>work.  Some say the lead should be melodic and everyone else follow<br/>that.  Some say the bass should be the foundation.  Some say everyone<br/>should adapt continuously.  I say everyone should learn to remember<br/>the tonic and relate themselves to absolute chord progressions around<br/>the tonic.</p><p>My version makes the harmonic progression more effective, does not<br/>harm the melody, and makes clarity and therefore better tuning and<br/>better singing possible.</p><p>To say it is not a matter of taste would be wrong.  But my concept is<br/>shared by others I&apos;ve spoken to and fits very strongly within the<br/>tradition of barbershop style.  Reality will show everything from<br/>singers who feel they know their part and won&apos;t adapt to anything to<br/>singers who will be so adaptive that they&apos;ll go off pitch on single<br/>notes just because someone else slightly wavered.</p><p>I should/could do more scientific testing, but preliminary<br/>observations show this:<br/>Typical barbershoppers listening to a chord on 1/1 followed by a<br/>4:5:6:7 rooted on 81/64 hear the progression as part of a pythagorean<br/>III-VI-II-V-I progression.  When they hear a 1/1 rooted chord followed<br/>by a 4:5:6:7 rooted on 5/4, they hear it as leading to the relative<br/>minor in a III-vi progression.  It is very strong to me, as I&apos;m now<br/>used to that difference.<br/>Since barbershoppers already hear that difference somewhat and can<br/>EASILY be taught to hear the difference moreso...  well, the<br/>notational difference between 27/16 (or 3^3) vs a 5/4 (or just 5) root<br/>indicates a totally different chord progression.  In vague adaptive JI<br/>these useful and musical distinctions may be lost or may be<br/>arbitrarily up to the performers to realize by chance if they are<br/>aware enough.  I&apos;m adding clarity and function to the concept.</p><p>And so I&apos;m not just talking off the top of my head, there&apos;s part tapes<br/>that clearly demonstrate this exact tuning, and so far nobody has said<br/>they even sound like a new way to do barbershop.  Everyone thinks they<br/>just sound good, if a bit computerized and sterile.</p><p>So yes, I&apos;m challenging the entire &quot;adaptive JI&quot; concept of barbershop<br/>tuning.  I think the point that it is more realistic is not relevant.<br/> We don&apos;t say that a serious student violinist playing with piano<br/>accompanimant is &quot;adaptive ET&quot; do we?  I think the goal is more about<br/>understanding the musical value of these choices and about<br/>understanding how everyone is placing the tones within their<br/>understanding in their head.</p><p>It&apos;s not about obsessively describing the complex, imperfect reality<br/>of real human performances.  That&apos;s a different discussion.  Using the<br/>issues of real human performance to support the &quot;adaptive JI&quot; theory<br/>would be like saying that performers intend to never actually be 100%<br/>in sync rhythmically, just because we can scientifically show that<br/>they never are.  Some performers intend to be synced and some don&apos;t.<br/>That&apos;s why this is artistic.  It&apos;s about intent.  And I don&apos;t think<br/>barbershoppers tend to want to be vague and adaptive.  They want to<br/>ring chords and sing the words and use harmonic progressions to<br/>embellish tonic.  That&apos;s why almost none of them find my JI recordings<br/>to violate anything of their understanding of barbershop.</p><p>-Aaron</p><p>P.S.

This has to be considered<br/>&gt; on a spectrum and it relates to memory and perception.

I&apos;m using the term &quot;root&quot; to relate to each and<br/>every chord fundamental.  I think the tonal center change is both a<br/>question of how people hear things, and what is intended.  3-4 time<br/>signature vs 6-8 says things about how to feel the music even though<br/>the number of notes in the measures is the same.  Likewise, a composer<br/>choosing to indicate a key change versus using accidentals indicates<br/>how they would like the musicians to treat the notes.  If we don&apos;t<br/>have a key change indicated, then I&apos;ll assume the chords are treated<br/>as per their relation to the original key.

No?</p><p>&gt; &gt; What did you think of the strictness of my proposal?  I agreed<br/>&gt; &gt; that only one comma pair is needed (+/-), and implied the<br/>&gt; &gt; root should be changed as often as necessary to spell all chords<br/>&gt; &gt; in &apos;lowest terms&apos;.

But I know of no way to notate progressions by 3rds in<br/>any sort of short-hand way, and I know of nobody who has ingrained the<br/>way that sort of modulation sounds.  Fact is, progressions modulating<br/>by 5 identities are simply not as common because that is a higher<br/>identity to function off of.  Once we are in the realm of music that<br/>nobody is used to then we might as well just notate everything<br/>specifically and not look for standards or shortcuts.  We can always<br/>stick to using ratio notation.</p><p>&gt; &gt; 1. Supporting a tonic in a utonal fashion such as otonal chords<br/>&gt; &gt; rooted on 8/5, 4/3, or 16/9.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure what you mean by this.  Barbershop as 7-limit<br/>&gt; music is notable for its paucity of utonal chords.</p><p>Ok, not Utonal CHORDS, but utonal roots in relation to 1/1.  As I<br/>said, otonal chords rooted on things like 8/5 or 4/3 or 16/9.  Those<br/>are all very very common.  Those chords allow for a held tonic note in<br/>one part that is embellished by making that 1/1 become a 5 identity or<br/>a 3 or a 9, or sometimes a 15.  Those chords are very common.  But not<br/>any chord like that, mostly those.  There doesn&apos;t tend to be an 8/7<br/>rooted chord.</p><p>Point is that the circle-of-fifths progressions are common, and so are<br/>these chords that temporarily harmonize a stable tonic to become<br/>different parts of a chord.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m also using a few other related chords, but not going too<br/>&gt; &gt; darn far out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even if you stay within 12 fifths, the tuning &apos;problems&apos; that<br/>&gt; occur with a progression like CM - EM - Amin - G#min - BM -<br/>&gt; EbM - CM are non-obvious and only get solved through lots of<br/>&gt; practice singing them... or from a score where the composer&apos;s<br/>&gt; worked them out ahead of time.  No?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t recall ever seeing something like G#min in a CM song in the<br/>barbershop world, or almost any other for that matter.  Sure it is a<br/>fine progression, but as it would not be obvious to an ear-singer, it<br/>would have to be up to the composer to indicate how it was intended.</p><p>A lot of my whole perspective is arguing that most of everything I&apos;ve<br/>been using and seen in most barbershop is stuff that is apparent by<br/>ear and that woodshedders and ear-singers could arrive at on their<br/>own.  That is my limiting factor, ear-singing, that divides the more<br/>simple progressions from the more thought out and difficult ones.  So<br/>even in my circle-of-fifths progressions, I think we can only go to<br/>about 3^5 at the most, and MAYBE 3^6, but anything past that is<br/>certainly way too far for ear-singers to follow.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know about running drift totals... that sounds &quot;absolute&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; to me,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is, but it&apos;s just a running total, it&apos;s not specifying the<br/>&gt; pitch of any note in particular.  It just lets you check if<br/>&gt; you&apos;re going flat because of the score or because you&apos;re not<br/>&gt; standing up straight.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I can see the use of that.  I&apos;d just only use it when it seemed needed.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So it&apos;s very complicated.

In other words, there are<br/>times when we can really say that something can be open to<br/>interpretation.  For example I notated &quot;dips&quot; in the recent score to<br/>indicate sections that are effectively just a chord dipping and coming<br/>back.  Those do not in any way need to be JI or anything, they can be<br/>whatever is adapted to, within the idea of flatting and returning to<br/>where we were.  That is adaptive, and in that sense I feel there are<br/>sections or chords that can be adaptively done in barbershop.  But I<br/>feel that the majority is NOT adaptive, but is essentially extended JI<br/>plus or minus normal human error and issues of reality of live music.<br/> But not as adaptive as the &quot;dips&quot; that really could be any amount<br/>within reason.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I could probably produce such a list eventually if I had a<br/>&gt; &gt; more clear concept of what you mean...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You presented one recently.  You said iii V IV I progressions<br/>&gt; tend to be tuned a certain way, sound most natural to<br/>&gt; barbershoppers...  Collect those, and you&apos;re in business.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Adding common 7ths, I&apos;d say that would be iii: 5/4, 3/2, 15/8; V7:<br/>3/2, 15/8, 9/8, 21/16; IV7: 4/3, 5/3, 1/1, 7/6; I: 1/1, 5/4, 3/2.</p><p>Obviously, the iii has only one note different from the V, and only<br/>one note different from a I chord.  So whether the singer hears iii as<br/>relating to I or V it will still be tuned as I&apos;ve indicated.  V is<br/>obvious and in barbershop will be a harmonic seventh chord.<br/>Regardless of the issues between V and IV, barbershoppers will always<br/>hear both as relating to I.  Both V-I and IV-I cadences are common,<br/>and the singers quickly learn to relate those.  V leads to I, but<br/>going to IV first allows a melody or other prominent note to still hit<br/>1/1, but be harmonized differently by the other parts making the IV<br/>chord.  Barbershoppers certainly do not relate V and IV to each other<br/>as much as they relate them each to I.</p><p>Is this the sort of discussion and chart or whatever that you are<br/>talking about?

Extended JI inherently has notes that are distant by<br/>commas.  So somehow you are saying that &quot;straightforward extended JI&quot;<br/>can&apos;t include moving between these notes that are a comma apart???</p><p>&gt; I think your point that shifts are a lot less noticable in<br/>&gt; a capella singing is a significant one, and I encourage you<br/>&gt; to write a little something on it with examples.  I personally<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think melodic intervals are held to JI as well as<br/>&gt; harmonic ones in human performances.  I don&apos;t think they&apos;re<br/>&gt; held to the precise tempered values called for by Vicentino&apos;s<br/>&gt; brand of adaptive JI, for example, but ....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>I think melody is based mostly on two factors: contour and memory.  In<br/>other words, simply hearing a note as &quot;that&apos;s like that one from<br/>earlier&quot; along with generally having the pitch go up and down, that&apos;s<br/>what governs melody.</p><p>The only reason JI would play into it is either:</p><p>1. from (subconsciously) remembering the sound of various harmonics<br/>and relating that another note sounds similar because some of it&apos;s<br/>harmonics remind you of ones from a previous note<br/>or<br/>2. from remembering JI relationships generally heard in harmonic<br/>contexts.  This is an issue of being musically trained or having<br/>cultural experience to expect certain notes in a melody.</p><p>So for the most part, I agree about JI being more important<br/>harmonically than melodically.  I&apos;d go so far as to say that tuning as<br/>a whole is not so important in totally unaccompanied (no drone) melodies.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/1/2006 12:25:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; I think if you had a harmonic language based on modulations<br/>&gt; &gt; by 3rds, people trained to recognize 5th-based progressions<br/>&gt; &gt; with the clock notation would be lost.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fine, I agree.

In my mind we have to consider how much we work with<br/>existing notation that people already have learned.  If we throw that<br/>out the window, then maybe the entire staff system is not the best<br/>notation.  If we try to fit into what people know then my question is<br/>how many people out there have any concept of any of the things in<br/>your or my notation ideas?  In other words, the value of working<br/>within current systems is to appeal to real people who know them.  So<br/>we must consider exactly who our musicians are that will be reading<br/>this stuff.  If your music is too far removed for anyone knowing<br/>traditional systems to relate your music to the traditional systems,<br/>then I wouldn&apos;t bother with traditional notation concepts at all<br/>necessarily.</p><p>&gt; &gt; There doesn&apos;t tend to be an 8/7 rooted chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would guess it&apos;d be the preferred motion between a pair of<br/>&gt; 4-5-6-7 chords a whole tone apart, all else being equal.  I<br/>&gt; wonder if such modulations are just rare in barbershop, or if<br/>&gt; even when they occur singers tend not to use 8/7...<br/>&gt;</p><p>No, I think the issue where the chords are leading.  In other words, I<br/>progression of I-II7-I could have II7 on 8/7, but that isn&apos;t so<br/>common.  The common progression is I-II7-V7-I, so the II will be 9/8<br/>to carry on towards the 3/2 rooted V7.  And since that progression is<br/>SO common, singers will hear that and do that anytime they see I-II7,<br/>and then if it goes right back to I, then they&apos;ll just go back.  The<br/>end result is chords rooted on 1/1 and 9/8.  To my ear using 8/7<br/>sounds outside of the normal barbershop sound even in this case.  But<br/>I think it is musically valid, so if that were desired it could be<br/>notated and taught to be done that way, even though it is outside what<br/>would be common.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Are they really on such roots, though, or do you just mean to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; indicate a number of approximate fifths?

The trick is convincing<br/>leads to care about how they fit with everyone else.  Once the<br/>harmonic context is clear, the melody still sounds fine.  It&apos;s just<br/>like I said in my last post:  Melody is not as important to be exactly<br/>tuned as is harmony.  So it is no stretch for the leads to tune to the<br/>chord and still feel that they are more or less on the right melody note.</p><p>In reality, of course that sort of fudging happens, but it isn&apos;t at a<br/>level where singers aware of these issue choose to prefer the fudged<br/>version when they really can hear both.  I have yet to find singers<br/>who are aware enough of these differences to have a clear preference.<br/> Those who can hear the differences simply find it interesting and can<br/>see my position that the chord relationships should be of primary<br/>focus when considering tuning.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; ... shouldn&apos;t the notation allow them to notate what they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; want to achieve?
