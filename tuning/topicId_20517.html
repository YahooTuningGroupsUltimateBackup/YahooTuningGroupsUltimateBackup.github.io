Yes, the terms seem<br/>VERY similar, but I believe &quot;polyphony&quot; could also refer to a texture<br/>of voices that were moving, but somewhat static, whereas<br/>&quot;counterpoint&quot; would generally imply more activity... but the terms,<br/>in this sense, I believe are somewhat subjective...</p><p>_________ _____ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
