If we look at &lt;16/15, 25/24, 81/80, 64/63, 33/32&gt;^(-1) we get<br/>[h7,h5,h3,-v7,v11] where h3, h5, and h7 are the standard 11-limit versions of the 3,5, and 7 ets, and v7 and v11 are the 7-adic and<br/>11-adic valuations. If we have either some way of symbolizing both major and minor semitones or equivalently a semitone and the minor diesis of 128/125, we have a way of representing the 5-limit without involving higher limits. Perhaps George has already done this and I failed to understand.</p><p>In any case, having done this the 7 and 11 limits are now extensions of the 5-limit system so obtained in the simplest way imaginable, namely by means of the 7 and 11-adic valuations which simply check for the exponent of 7 and 11 in the prime factorization. It seems to me that if saggital doesn&apos;t already work this way, then perhaps it should; it would give us a nice system which would cover the JI<br/>11-limit, but also reduce neatly to the 7 or 5 limits.</p><p>Another aspect of interest is that this can easily be extended to the 13-limit, so that there is a nice 13-limit saggital availble if anyone wants it. We simply take [h7,h5,h3,v7,v11,v13]^(-1) and obtain &lt;16/15,25/24,81/80,63/64,33/32,39/40&gt;, from which we see that adding a symbol for 40/39 extends this scheme of notation.</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2002 10:02:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; A familiar &quot;notation&quot; in my sense for the 5-limit has a basis<br/>&gt; &lt;16/15, 25/24, 81/80&gt;; this can readily be related to the diatonic<br/>&gt;scale.
