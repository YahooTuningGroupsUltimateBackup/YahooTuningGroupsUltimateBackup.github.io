Look into playing slide<br/>with an open tuning on any kind of guitar.  Just raise the action if<br/>necessary.</p><p>What type of guitar are you considering?  Classical, Steel String, Electric?<br/>Do you play fingerstyle or with a pick?</p><p>Fretless guitars are prone to horrible sustain problems.  A sarod is like a<br/>fretless guitar, but it&apos;s fingered with the fingernail (potentially painful,<br/>and difficult - lot&apos;s of Krazy glue on broken nails) and it&apos;s got about 20<br/>sympathetic strings to give it sustain.  I&apos;ve heard a fretless classical<br/>that sounded terrible.  Fretless electric guitars are the most practical.<br/>Jon Catler claims that hard epoxy is the best material for fretless guitar<br/>fingerboards.  There are fretless banjos, but I don&apos;t much like the sound of<br/>them either.</p><p>Tune the guitar to your favorite chord fingering, and use that same<br/>inversion up and down the neck.</p><p>If all your music is in 4 or 5 keys, we could work out a meantone system<br/>that works well in those keys, or even JI for all your favorite chords.<br/>These kind of fretboards are often the most artistic looking and rewarding<br/>to play.  Basically what Catler uses now.</p><p>31 tone equal has much better approximations of JI intervals than 12.  You<br/>wouldn&apos;t loose sustain, and your average audience wouldn&apos;t hear the<br/>difference.  Those who did, would probably like it.  Cadences would have the<br/>same meaning, but sound better in tune.</p><p>Another idea is a scalloped fretboard.  That way at least you can sharpen<br/>some strings with finger pressure.</p><p>Last thought:  Is your guitar really 12tet?  An improperly positioned<br/>saddle, or high action could cause the guitar to play very out of tune.<br/>Maybe having the action and intonation adjusted really carefully and<br/>possibly some nut compensation would fix you right up?</p><p>---<br/>Glen Peterson<br/>Peterson Stringed Instruments<br/>30 Elm Street North Andover, MA 01845<br/>(978) 975-1527<br/><a href="http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson">http://www.organicdesign.org/peterson</a></p></div><h3><a id=5724 href="#5724">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
