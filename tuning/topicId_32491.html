I mean we&apos;d gotten along nothing<br/>&gt; short of magically to date, and being the furtive hermit that I am I<br/>&gt; was quite reluctant to mess with that. It&apos;s just too damn rare. Ken on<br/>&gt; the other hand, while surely no socialite, is by nature a bit more<br/>&gt; gregarious than I am, and he was pretty intent on making a<br/>&gt; get-together happen. I&apos;m glad he was.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We met halfway at my mother&apos;s place in Duxbury on Green Harbor. Green<br/>&gt; Harbor is a ghost town this time of year, and we braved the howling<br/>&gt; winter winds and walked the abandoned beach in a light rain.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was surreal and mundane, and it was beautiful and a bit melancholic<br/>&gt; as well. On it&apos;s best days, so is life... today was one of those days.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Several years ago Ken asked me if I&apos;d like to play on his then<br/>&gt; upcoming CD, Is that my world that hovers? As I&apos;d long admired Ken&apos;s<br/>&gt; work, I jumped for it--I played in 13-tet and Ken played in 12-tet,<br/>&gt; together. Clash? No they didn&apos;t clash, they left footprints in the<br/>&gt; same sand we walked in today... I&apos;ll miss my friend Ken Rubenstein.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Dan Stearns<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.  You may subscribe through<br/>&gt; email.
