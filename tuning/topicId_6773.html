I could have been<br/>&gt; gravely mistaken. I guess I was going by the high-school<br/>&gt; delineations of Renaissance=modal=1500-1600, and<br/>&gt; Baroque=tonal=1600-1750. Can you straighten me out?</p><p>Please let me begin by acknowledging that this is indeed a very common<br/>traditional chronology, and that the idea of a Manneristic Era<br/>combining what would traditionally be called the Late Renaissance and<br/>Early Baroque (say 1540-1640) has become more popular during the last<br/>few decades.</p><p>In fact, the question of whether the Early Baroque or Late Manneristic<br/>epoch -- the early 17th century, in either case -- should be viewed as<br/>modal, tonal, or something else is very much up for grabs, and may<br/>remain so, since so much of the issue depends on analytical tastes and<br/>preferences, reflected in how one defines the problem and applies that<br/>definition to the music at hand.</p><p>Given that our focus here is on tunings, I will try to keep my<br/>discussion _relatively_ brief, and to give some weight to the possible<br/>role of intonational changes as &quot;markers&quot; of stylistic and conceptual<br/>changes in the music itself.</p><p>First, let us give the traditional chronology its due. Around 1600,<br/>two events occur which do mark a significant change. The first is the<br/>advent of the figured bass (continuo or thoroughbass), which tends<br/>often to appear in new soloistic forms where the upper melody and bass<br/>line are accompanied by tertian consonances. The second is the<br/>introduction of novel and bold dissonances by composers such as<br/>Monteverdi and Gesualdo, many of which would become features of the<br/>major/minor key system.</p><p>While these factors would be noteworthy in any case, the traditional<br/>view of the major/minor system as the natural and logical culmination<br/>of music history made it understandable that historians would focus on<br/>aspects of Monteverdi&apos;s style shared in common with the later<br/>17th-century key system as developed by such composers as Stradella<br/>and Corelli, and codified somewhat later by Rameau (1722).</p><p>From this musicological viewpoint, Renaissance modality was a kind of<br/>barrier to the full realization and music, and by using new<br/>dissonances, Monteverdi became a champion of &quot;progress.&quot; It was<br/>assumed that because late 17th-century composers such as Corelli<br/>incorporated these dissonances into a major/minor key system, this was<br/>Monteverdi&apos;s agenda also. Similarly, the figured bass was seen as a<br/>&quot;liberation&quot; from a supposed 16th-century orientation to complex<br/>counterpoint as a musical norm.</p><p>Before presenting the case for an alternative viewpoint, I should<br/>confess my own biases. A standing joke, my own, has it that while most<br/>analysts explain 16th-century progressions in 18th-century terms, I<br/>tend to explain them in 14th-century terms, so that one might seek a<br/>balanced view by a certain law of averages &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>To support a viewpoint that the early 17th century is still modal in<br/>its approach, the opinions of early 17th-century composers and<br/>innovative theorists themselves may be of interest. Thus in their<br/>manifesto of 1607, Claudio Monteverdi and his brother Guilio Cesare<br/>Monteverdi describe themselves as exponents of a _seconda prattica_ or<br/>&quot;Second Practice&quot; originated by Cipriano de Rore (1516-1565) and<br/>illustrated by various madrigalists during the later 16th century.</p><p>Also, they describe and defend Claudio&apos;s compositions as mixing<br/>different modes in the best tradition of Josquin, Striggio, Rore, and<br/>Willaert -- the first and last of special interest, since they<br/>represent the classical Renaissance tradition or _prima prattica_<br/>(&quot;First Practice&quot;) as opposed to the newer or Manneristic one.</p><p>In my view, it is unfortunate that the Monteverdi brothers omitted<br/>from their lists of composers of the newer style the name of Nicola<br/>Vicentino (1511-1576), who in his famous treatise of 1555 defended the<br/>use of any dissonance or unusual melodic leap for the sake of textual<br/>expression, and who also advocated an artful commingling of modes both<br/>for &quot;architectural variety&quot; and as a means of expressing a text.</p><p>Turning to the music itself, recent scholars such as Carl Dahlhaus<br/>have pointed to the fluid modal aspects of music around 1600,<br/>including the radical madrigals of Monteverdi. Here &quot;modality&quot; should<br/>be taken to mean not only the variety of octave species, but the<br/>continued use of vertical progressions guided by such two-voice<br/>resolutions as major third to fifth, for example (with C4 as middle C,<br/>and higher numbers showing higher octaves):</p><p>E4  F#4<br/>B3  D4<br/>G#3 A3<br/>E3  D3</p><p>Here we have a progression between two complete 5-limit sonorities<br/>harmoniously related by a two-part motion &quot;to the nearest consonance&quot;<br/>between the lower pair of voices (M3-5). Such progressions might often<br/>be difficult to fit into a later 17th-century key scheme, but are<br/>routine in what I might term modal/combinative practice, where motion<br/>between tertian sonorities is often guided by such conjunct<br/>progressions. Note the local accidental inflections which may make a<br/>third before a fifth major, for example. This is one instance of how<br/>the flow of 5-limit sonorities in Monteverdi or Gesualdo may be guided<br/>by 3-limit progressions going back to the 13th and 14th centuries.</p><p>Also, Monteverdi&apos;s or Gesualdo&apos;s use of new note-against-note dissonances<br/>such as seventh sonorities can be seen in an early 17th-century<br/>context as a kind of poetical or rhetorical device, as Dahlhaus as<br/>well as a 17th-century theorist such as Christoph Bernhard (c. 1655)<br/>notes. Again, an intervallic or &quot;combinative&quot; approach rather than a<br/>scheme of later key functions may fit best:</p><p>1    2   &amp; | 1 ...<br/>C4   B3      C#4<br/>A3      G#3  A3<br/>D3   E3      A2</p><p>m7   5   -<br/>5    4 - M3</p><p>Here we have a striking minor seventh between the outer voices which<br/>resolves by stepwise contrary motion to the fifth as the lower two<br/>voices form a 4-3 suspension. Such a combinative viewpoint may best<br/>fit the early 17th century, although in Stradella or Corelli or later<br/>the same progression might fit into some scheme of key functions of<br/>the kind later described by Rameau and his followers. Dahlhaus points<br/>out that these dissonances might be used from either stylistic point<br/>of view.</p><p>From an intonational view, by the way, Vicenzo Galilei, a champion of<br/>these novel dissonances in the 1580&apos;s, argues that dissonance is a<br/>part of the nature of music: just as an octave at 2:1 is concordant,<br/>so a minor seventh at 9:5 is naturally dissonant. In 1/4-comma<br/>meantone, such sevenths would be midway between 16:9 and 9:5, nicely<br/>fitting a stylistic ethos in which sonorities mixing these intervals<br/>with ideally blending thirds express a mixture of &quot;the sweet and the<br/>strong.&quot;</p><p>To finish the nonintonational part of the argument, another point<br/>would be that early 17th-century continuo may have at least as much in<br/>common with 16th-century approaches to note-against-note writing or<br/>improvisation as with the key system of Stradella or Corelli in<br/>practice and Rameau in theory.</p><p>For one fine statement of this point, see Miguel A. Roig-Francoli,<br/>&quot;Playing in consonances: A Spanish Renaissance technique of chordal<br/>improvisation,&quot; _Early Music_ (August 1995), pp. 461-471. This article<br/>focuses especially on Tomas de Santa Maria&apos;s treatise of 1565 on the<br/>art of playing _fantasia_, likely meaning improvisation on keyboard or<br/>other polyphonic instruments. Santa Maria describes a system for<br/>moving between four-voice sonorities with the principal intervals<br/>measured between the upper voice or treble (_tiple_) and bass, the<br/>other parts serving only to &quot;fill the space&quot; between these voices and<br/>to add accompanying consonances.</p><p>In fact, I find that Santa Maria&apos;s analysis can apply nicely to some<br/>Spanish vocal music of around 1500 with mostly note-against-note<br/>motion, as well as to the keyboard styles which he describes.<br/>Roig-Francoli emphasizes that not only for this 16th-century tradition,<br/>but also for the early 17th century, such an approach need not imply<br/>the key system of Corelli or Rameau:</p><p>                 &quot;The same applies to 17th-century music:<br/>                  triadic progressions do not necessarily<br/>                  behave according to the tenets of<br/>                  functional harmony.&quot; (Ibid., 471 n. 22)</p><p>Interestingly, the point in time where there is general consensus that<br/>key functions _do_ apply, for example Corelli (c. 1680), is also the<br/>point at which meantone is challenged by the well-temperaments of<br/>Werckmeister and his followers.</p><p>From an intonational point of view, we might have two obvious<br/>&quot;markers&quot;: the rise of meantone as an alternative to Pythagorean<br/>tunings around 1450, and the rise of the unequal well-temperaments<br/>around 1680 -- or a bit before, if we consider the French &quot;ordinary<br/>temperaments&quot; which evolved from meantone.</p><p>One Netherlands tuning theorist and organist, Peter van Marissing, has<br/>suggested that meantone may encourage may encourage the development of<br/>vertical relations based on thirds, while well-temperaments may fit<br/>with a key system more consistently based on progressions by fifths<br/>and fourths. Vertical progressions with bass motion by a third,<br/>ranging from the unassumingly diatonic to the chromatic and even (for<br/>example in Vicentino) the enharmonic, are a common theme of<br/>16th-century and early 17th-century pieces writing during the meantone<br/>era, a characteristic feature of tertian modality contrasting with<br/>conventional 18th-century key harmony.</p><p>Having considered some of the issues regarding modality or tonality in<br/>the early 17th century, I might add that one scholar has proposed a<br/>category of &quot;monality&quot; (_mo_dality + to_nal_ity) to describe the style<br/>of this period, a clever linguistic compromise.</p><p>You raise some other very important issues, but suspecting that this<br/>&quot;brief&quot; response may already be long enough, I shall set them aside<br/>for another post.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
