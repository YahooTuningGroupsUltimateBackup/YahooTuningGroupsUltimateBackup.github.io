The table of numbers is the nearest thing that<br/>I have seen to my harmonics calculations outside of vedic literature.<br/>The calculations are not the same, but must have some similarities as<br/>many of the same numbers are there.</p><p>&gt;I submitted a posting about this interesting idea a couple of<br/>&gt;months ago, calling modulation along the 3 and 5 axes (the<br/>&gt;kind we&apos;re used to hearing or implying) &apos;lateral modulation&apos;<br/>&gt;and modulation along the 7 and 11 (and higher?) axes &apos;vertical<br/>&gt;modulation&apos;.</p><p>&gt;The terminology is loosely based on tonal lattice diagrams,<br/>&gt;since the 3 x 5 axes form a grid.</p><p>I also think of the 3 and 5 making the grid and the 7 as vertical.<br/>Of course we humans can&apos;t see extra orthogonal dimensions so sometimes I<br/>think of 2 as vertical (but very closely stacked).</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve noted also in my book that older concepts of tonal<br/>&gt;expansion were based on a lateral or horizontal expansion<br/>&gt;of pitch resources, while La Monte Young is perhaps the<br/>&gt;foremost explorer of the vertical expansion (using whole<br/>&gt;groups of primes into the 200s).</p><p>Ah, Pythagorean versus Galilean!</p><p>Personally I don&apos;t think that any primes beyond 23 are important in<br/>music of themselves.  However some may come about as a result of special<br/>modulations such as a 48 frequency modulated by a 1 will give a prime 47<br/>(and a 49) due to the interaction.  This raises another aspect of<br/>variations about the JI important notes and is another enormous topic in<br/>its own right - expect a post about that soon.</p><p>&gt;Many times here I&apos;ve talked about how for so many years as<br/>&gt;I worked in isolation, I thought I&apos;d &apos;invented&apos; lattice diagrams<br/>&gt;and lots of other aspects of my theory.</p><p>&gt;Getting on the Tuning List has shown me that work like this<br/>&gt;has been done before, and it&apos;s a delight to be able to argue<br/>&gt;aspects of it with others who know all about it.</p><p>I know the feeling well, but mainly in relation to physics ideas.<br/>The most wonderful thing about internet is that it allows people who<br/>have thoughts that only one in a million have to find the other members<br/>of that group around the world.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
