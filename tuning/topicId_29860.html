C# or G# major/minor.....?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; Or is it a note to<br/>&gt; be used in standard C major/minor?</p><p>Only if you&apos;re tonicizing E minor or something like that.</p><p>&gt; Is there any (mathematical) proof that it&apos;s better? :)</p><p>You&apos;re right to smile -- this is not a mathematical question.</p><p>&gt; I know this might sound a bit naive on my part, but<br/>&gt; I could argue you&apos;ve got used to the 5/4 pitch, just like<br/>&gt; so many other people get used to pitches even &apos;stranger&apos;<br/>&gt; than this. For example, as you pointed out earlier, the<br/>&gt; medievalists preferred a sharper Major third (fractionally<br/>&gt; /above/ 2^(5/12)) (this is over 20 cents out from the<br/>&gt; beat-less third!!).</p><p>Yes, but in Medieval music, the major third was a _dissonance_ that<br/>had to resolve! In Renaissance music, the major third was a _stable<br/>consonance_ -- very different!</p><p>&gt; I realise there&apos;s the evidence of the mean/just third<br/>&gt; being beat-less, but this is not good enough reason (IMHO)<br/>&gt; to mean that it&apos;s actually &apos;sweeter&apos; than the 12t-ET M.third.</p><p>There are other psychoacoustical phenomena we could go into besides<br/>beating -- such as roughness, virtual pitch, and combinational tones -<br/>- but I suspect such arguments won&apos;t convince you anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wondering if it&apos;s just been accepted for historical reasons<br/>&gt; rather than being selected for its pure merits (i.e. basing<br/>&gt; it on how it should sound)... and people have got used to it.</p><p>Well, all I can say is spend a few years playing with different<br/>tuning systems, until you can accept them _all_ for their unique<br/>qualities. _Then_ you can view all types of major thirds without<br/>bias, and _then_ you can decide if one is truly &quot;sweeter&quot; or<br/>something in a unique way.</p></div>
