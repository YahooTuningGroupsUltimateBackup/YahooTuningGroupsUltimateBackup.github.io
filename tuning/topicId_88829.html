A brat -1 tuning of mavila using the fourth<br/>&gt; &gt; as a generator is what you call Sarnak if I understand correctly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Samak. It&apos;s useful with recurrent sequences sometimes to<br/>&gt; differentiate the 2 directions, but eventually one name will<br/>&gt; designate the whole thing.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand fully where you find a &quot;brat - 1&quot; here, between<br/>&gt; the thirds (-3g for the major and +4g for the minor I guess ?) I have<br/>&gt; to study that, I arrived here for other reasons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I defined the brat in terms of the major third t and the fifth f, &gt; and sticking t=Samak^3/2 and f=2/Samak into the definition yields &gt; -1, the most equal of all the equal beat ratios.</p><p>It&apos;s different from the main usual &quot;brat&quot; then, it has to be precised.<br/>I still don&apos;t understand and even less, since the fifth beating is quite heavy in here.<br/>The &quot;minor brat&quot; (on effectively perceived maj6th/maj3rd beats) is doing good results with Kamas (or the Samak fifth) :<br/>mb = -1&gt;   24 - 5x^4 = 5x3 - 16  &gt;  Kamas (x^4 = 8 - x^3) or x = 1.477967243009<br/>and suggests as well other good ones :<br/>mb = -1/2&gt; 5x^4 = 56 - 10x^3 (Saptamak) &gt; 1.4768727445<br/>mb = -1&gt; x^4 = 8 - x^3 (Kamas-Samak) &gt; 1.477967243009<br/>mb = -2&gt; 10x^4 = 64 - 5x^3 (Dhamak) &gt; 1.4788452037<br/>mb = 2&gt;10x^4 = 5x^3 + 32 (Mismak) &gt; 1,4823738118<br/>mb = 1&gt; 5x^4 = 5x^3 + 8  (Samakmin) &gt; 1.4868066476<br/>but curiously, unless a mistake, Susak =<br/>mb = 1/2&gt; 5x^4 = 10x^3 - 8 &gt; 1.3506928321696  or 1.6317070309441<br/>gives a very strange result but ALSO a correct Pelog with the 1st solution !<br/>(2/Susak = 1.480721561828...)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Terzbirat is the only one without a rational brat, and I&apos;d be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interested to know the polynomial for it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, it&apos;s a good one :<br/>&gt; &gt; 9x2 = 8x + 4<br/>&gt; &gt; Obviously it doesn&apos;t belong to the same story. But it has an<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting -c property and gives a x^5 really close to 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know what a -c property is, but apparently this is another &gt; magic generator, and has one. It has a brat of<br/>&gt; (980 sqrt(13)+5704)/6561, but some other beat properties are rational.<br/>&gt; I think I&apos;ll give Magic[16] with both, and someone may be inspired &gt; to decide which makes for the better magic generator.</p><p>Is this the usual brat as well ? There is still something I don&apos;t understand since the algorithm has only a maximal power of 2 of the generator, so I don&apos;t know where you get the minor 3rd for example.<br/>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=89063 href="#89063">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2010 8:21:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jacques Dudon &lt;fotosonix@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is this the usual brat as well ?
