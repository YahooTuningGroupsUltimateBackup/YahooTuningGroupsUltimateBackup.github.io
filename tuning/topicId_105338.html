Precisely, two days ago I sent a message to a member of the<br/>list, where I wrote that I was told that these JI scales don&acute;t sound<br/>well and as I remember, a copy of this message was sent to you. I<br/>preferred to send you Piaji II instead of the one that might give<br/>imperfect chords. This was my personal thinking, but i respect the<br/>member&acute;s opinion.</p><p>Your position of using the historical conclusions of Mr. Helmhozt<br/>demonstrates nothing; should I got some similar propriety it comes<br/>from your tendency of beeing against me. Therefore I can&acute;t avoid to<br/>suggest you not to ask me in the future any information.
