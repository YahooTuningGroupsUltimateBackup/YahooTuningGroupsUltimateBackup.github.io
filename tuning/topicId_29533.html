Bach: Badinerie from Suite in B Minor (golden meantone)</p><p>  Danny Wier uploaded the MIDI file badinerie.mid this morning, and I<br/>  went and grabbed it.  Sounds very nice!  The harpsichord part is choppy<br/>  throughout much of the piece, but I&apos;m becoming used to it.</p><p>  For fun, I peeked at the tuning.  Was very surprised to find the circle<br/>  of fifths going from C to E#!  The piece is in B minor.</p><p>  But Danny is right.  I ran it thru my COFT analysis, and got the same<br/>  basic tuning (cents deviation from 12-tET):</p><p>       Danny  JdL&apos;s COFT<br/>      ------  ----------<br/>  C     0.00      +14.22<br/>  G    -3.78      +13.57<br/>  D    -7.57      +11.42<br/>  A   -11.35      +10.75<br/>  E   -15.14       +2.39<br/>  B   -18.92       -1.57<br/>  F#  -22.71       -2.49<br/>  C#  -26.49       -3.97<br/>  G#  -30.27       -8.72<br/>  D#  -34.06       -7.54<br/>  A#  -37.87      -11.76<br/>  E#  -41.65      -16.30</p><p>  I haven&apos;t adjusted for the absolute differences, but the change in<br/>  tuning across the circle of fifths tells the story.  His is even (.267<br/>  comma meantone); mine is of course jagged, reflecting the particular<br/>  intervals in the piece, and with a somewhat narrower overall range.<br/>  (what is the definition of &quot;golden meantone&quot; again?).</p><p>  I show adaptive 5-limit pain as not much less than COFT pain (22534 vs.<br/>  29652), which is not much less than 1/4 comma meantone C to E# (36033).<br/>  So this is one of those pieces that is extremely well suited to<br/>  meantone, just as Danny has done it.</p><p>  Thanks, Danny!</p><p>  JdL</p><p>        Yahoo!

Golden meantone is<br/>based on a diatonic scale where the ratio of major seconds to minor<br/>seconds are 1.6180:1.0000 -- the first number is called the golden<br/>mean and is defined as 0.5 + half the square root of 5.  That number<br/>is the limit of the ratio of two adjacent numbers in the Fibonacci<br/>sequence 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144...</p><p>I actually came up with this temperament independently before I found<br/>out who did it first.  I nicknamed it &quot;infinite-tone equal<br/>temperament&quot; since I wanted to have some idea of what equal<br/>temperaments might sound like beyond 19 and 31 in that class (that<br/>is, 50-tone, 81-tone, 131-tone, 212-tone etc.)</p><p>17-tone, 22-tone and 53-tone work differently by the way.</p><p>~DaW~</p></div>
