When mapping the marimba to a keyboard grid in order to facilitate the full tuning,<br/>Erv worked with a template that read from top to bottom 6 - 8 9 10 11 14 this causes the full dallesandro to span 2 octaves and a 2nd. there is one ton in the middle where two ratios fall which is dealt with in a way similar to yourself.<br/>Otherwise the 36 pitches unveils itself with the 31 open places available. this way you  end up with a harmonic hexad in the lower range with the subharmonic on the top of the instrument.<br/>Only then did he/we  fill in the blanks<br/>Such strategies were common in many of my compositions as far as chord spacing. so one instead of tempering one could also choose one in one place and another on another place on the fret board.<br/>the 1-3-7-9-11-15 seemed a good idea on a guitar cause there are two of them in the full 1-3-5-7-9-11 cps a 3/2 apart.<br/>22 tones to the octave .<br/>  I had always hope to make a bass marimba with say only  20 notes that might span an octave and a half at least.</p><p>When i would hang my small bars I would experiment with spacing my hexad in different ways depending on what harmonics i wanted to be next to others.</p><p>i don&apos;t think it is a good tuning for a guitar, but i welcome to be surprised. In reality , if someone plays for hours on just about any instrument, one is going to find some useful things and music will come out, like it always does. Like most good scales, one can place the ratios to the side and use it as exploring it purely melodic properties. Which also i ended up doing toward the end of my use of these instruments, which became too hard to use on a regular basis<br/> Subject: Re: A combination-product-set guitar (part 3)</p><p>Part 3 (the final part) is now up, at<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_13059.html#13059">/makemicromusic/topicId_13059.html#13059</a></p><p>Part 1 is at<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_13042.html#13042">/makemicromusic/topicId_13042.html#13042</a></p><p>Part 2 is at<br/><a href="/makemicromusic/topicId_13048.html#13048">/makemicromusic/topicId_13048.html#13048</a></p><p>In part 3 information is given to help set up the tuning on a pair of keyboards so you can get to hear it, and some practical matters of refretting are discussed.
