Make sense?<br/>&quot;&quot;&quot;</p><p>I still think you were saying what I thought you said there.</p><p>The scale tree shows rational numbers, and how you relate those to scales is up to you.  The simplest way is that the number refers to the ratio of generator to period.  In that case there&apos;s nothing to say which of the scale steps is the larger.  You can get the scale tree to distinguish the L and s, as I showed before.  I&apos;m thinking now that it might make sense for the lines connecting the nodes to be the L and s scales.</p><p>A branch of the scale tree has a lot of different nodes on it.  The scale tree shows relationships between scales, not only the scales themselves.  It wouldn&apos;t be very interesting otherwise, would it?  You don&apos;t need the diagram to show what a 7+5 scale is.</p><p>The 2+3 branch you said no such thing about above would be (use fixed width font, etc):</p><p>| 2                               3<br/>|<br/>|                 5<br/>|         7               8<br/>|     9       12      13      11<br/>|   11  16  19  17  18  21  19  14</p><p>Now, that certainly includes everything that could sensibly be called &quot;meantone&quot;.  It also includes the mavila family (which was a shape before it was a temperament).  And it includes a whole load of other stuff that looks nothing at all like meantone.</p><p>But you can always draw a line around the ones you think are meantone, and then think of other names for the other groups.  Maybe it&apos;s already disappeared under your SEP field, but you might have to decide if 17-equal is a meantone or not.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=60529 href="#60529">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2005 6:54:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I have always been the same way. as soon as i have a tuning , the first thing i want are letter names, even if i associate numbers with them, it gives them more identity, like people</p><p>  From: &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:igliashon@sbcglobal.net">igliashon@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: EDO classification by families of scale patterns</p><p> It&apos;s<br/>just that I find words so much more appealing than numbers, especially<br/>when there are already so many numbers to be dealt with.  -- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3><a id=60530 href="#60530">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2005 8:26:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>wallyesterpaulrus wrote:</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s still 5+2 though, even though it&apos;s in 31-equal, so I&apos;m not sure &gt; why you need a different convention here.</p><p>3*2 + 5*5 = 8*2 + 3*5 = 13*2 + 1*5 = 31</p><p>There are three different 5+2 scales in 31-equal.

Allow me to clarify it as &quot;a specific number of<br/>equal-sized large steps (l; plural l&apos;s) and equal-sized small steps<br/>(s; plural s&apos;s), that when summed together are equal to the number of<br/>notes in the scale.&quot;  So an n-tonic scale shape would be defined as<br/>l+s=n.  The name would tell you both the number of l&apos;s or s&apos;s and the<br/>number of notes n.  The example I gave is misleading, I would not use<br/>the term &quot;meantone&quot; even to denote meantone-esque scales (such as<br/>5l+2s or 2l+3s).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The scale tree shows rational numbers, and how you relate those to<br/>&gt; scales is up to you.  The simplest way is that the number refers to the<br/>&gt; ratio of generator to period.  In that case there&apos;s nothing to say<br/>which<br/>&gt; of the scale steps is the larger.  You can get the scale tree to<br/>&gt; distinguish the L and s, as I showed before.  I&apos;m thinking now that it<br/>&gt; might make sense for the lines connecting the nodes to be the L and s<br/>&gt; scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A branch of the scale tree has a lot of different nodes on it.  The<br/>&gt; scale tree shows relationships between scales, not only the scales<br/>&gt; themselves.  It wouldn&apos;t be very interesting otherwise, would it?  You<br/>&gt; don&apos;t need the diagram to show what a 7+5 scale is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 2+3 branch you said no such thing about above would be (use fixed<br/>&gt; width font, etc):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; | 2                               3<br/>&gt; |<br/>&gt; |                 5<br/>&gt; |         7               8<br/>&gt; |     9       12      13      11<br/>&gt; |   11  16  19  17  18  21  19  14<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, that certainly includes everything that could sensibly be called<br/>&gt; &quot;meantone&quot;.  It also includes the mavila family (which was a shape<br/>&gt; before it was a temperament).  And it includes a whole load of other<br/>&gt; stuff that looks nothing at all like meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But you can always draw a line around the ones you think are meantone,<br/>&gt; and then think of other names for the other groups.  Maybe it&apos;s already<br/>&gt; disappeared under your SEP field, but you might have to decide if<br/>&gt; 17-equal is a meantone or not.</p><p>This is all well and good, perhaps would make a good wall chart, but<br/>it has nothing to do with what I originally asked, which was for<br/>advice on NOMENCLATURE, what to CALL the families.  Fortunately, I<br/>think all my questions have been answered and I now have a workable<br/>solution, which I will post shortly.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=60548 href="#60548">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2005 5:59:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot; &lt;igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Allow me to clarify it as &quot;a specific number of<br/>&gt; equal-sized large steps (l; plural l&apos;s) and equal-sized small steps<br/>&gt; (s; plural s&apos;s), that when summed together are equal to the number of<br/>&gt; notes in the scale.&quot;</p><p>And does distributional eveness come in here?
