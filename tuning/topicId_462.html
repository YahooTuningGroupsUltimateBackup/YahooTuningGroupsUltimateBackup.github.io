Deeply informed by independent artistry, acoustic ecology, aesthetic philosophy, and new technology, Auricle is a catalyst for fresh ideas put forth at a moment that is crying out for a new definition of what music can be. If you prize your appreciation of music as advanced; If conventional music does not reflect your values; If you are as aware of the social, political, scientific, environmental and spiritual substance of sound as its entertainment applications, then read on and join us in an adventurous odyssey to the heart of the auricular self.<br/>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>INNERVIEW - &quot;I&apos;ve been described in a seminar brochure as an &quot;enemy of the music industry.&quot; Actually, although I heartily loathe 98% of it, I am not its enemy. That would, firstly, give it energy and, secondly, attract its hostile attention towards me. Neither serves my aim. I remain impartial to its operatives, unless they impact negatively upon myself or my family. Otherwise, I work alongside, and sometimes glide within before leaving again.&quot; -Robert Fripp @ <a href="mailto:DGM@disciplinegm.demon.co.uk">DGM@disciplinegm.demon.co.uk</a>.<br/>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>FEED - Carl Steadman explains why MP3 isn&apos;t the future of music @ <a href="http://www.feedmag.com/column/killerapp/ck152_master.html">http://www.feedmag.com/column/killerapp/ck152_master.html</a>.<br/>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>AFFAIRS - South African President Nelson Mandela has asked leading British DJ, Carl Cox and the sex machine himself, James Brown to play at a special gig in South Africa this February.<br/>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>The headlines of musical application are often grabbed by dramatic recounts of the pop spectacle, while musical moods subtley influence the realms of everyday life.<br/>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>ELEMENTS - Synaesthesia: Physically, a sensation felt in one part of the body when another part is stimulated. Psychologically, a process in which one type of stimulus produces a secondary, subjective sensation, as when a specific color evokes a specific smell sensation. Better put, it is the experiencing of sensation in one sense modality (eg, visual images) when the actual stimulus is in another modality (eg, sounds). People who report such experiences are called &quot;synaesthetes&quot;. The Russian composer Scriabin is reported to have experienced colors when he heard music. Thus, he experienced &quot;chromesthesia,&quot; the most common form of syaesthesia.<br/>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>AUDIOPHILIA - AudioMUSINGS is an audiophile newsletter reviewing the latest audio equipment purchased in the marketplace and auditioned in real rooms @ <a href="http://home.earthlink.AAAnet/~audiomusings/">http://home.earthlink.AAAnet/~audiomusings/</a>.<br/>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>SONICA - Sound is now being used for recycling. Kinetic Disintegration System has developed a means to disintegrate nearly all non-metallic substances into fine powders using sound waves. The effect of this development is that it produces a cost-effective means of breaking down, separating, and transporting previously problematic recyclable materials such as rubber tires, plastics, glass, and solid bio-wastes. It could prove to be a huge step in helping maintain our resources through recycling and so further limit the amount of land we dedicate to trash dumps and landfills.<br/>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>FREEZONE - There are plenty of servers on the net which offer to put up soundfiles for free.

With a calculated disregard for pop logic and rhythm, we hear a more impulsive, discontinuous series of sound collages at times improvisational as if automatic cinema. Perhaps deciding that music aims at representing peripheral aspects of the outside world, this output puts seemingly subliminal actions in a new noetic context by releasing them from lucid sound reasoning.<br/>Links: Douglas Wolk interview @ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/autechre-interview">http://www.amazon.com/autechre-interview</a><br/>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>NICHEMAP - &quot;Tranceint&quot; : Move with the new technomadic sound.<br/>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>One one of many levels, aural culture rises from the production of many pieces of music that interlace and reinforce one another over many generations to expand like a growing organism into an audioverse of seemingly infinite possibility.<br/>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>FACTOID - According to online market researcher Jupiter Communications, there are now over 85,000 websites dedicated to music.

We forget that by simply listening to the right music we can relax, revive and empower our well being. Creating your own personal listening room is a celebration of the whole self. It can be a reward to your mind, body and spirit. It is one place you can go to, again and again, to travel to new worlds and attain peace of mind. The purpose of creating the listening room is to have a special place to relax and listen as a ritual of calm and a dawning of clarity. It is your sacred place to unwind, luxuriate, and heal. Listening is both a fine art and a magical act, a ritual connecting you to the power of your sonic affinities. It is an essential element of life that promises enduring rewards. To relax yourself with the auroma of enchanting sounds is to commune with your self. In a sanctum of sound, we can breath freely, be delighted, and find deep enjoyment.</p><p>So dim the lights, burn candles and incense, spray aromatic oils, and create your own private retreat where you can enjoy tasty morsels, drink wine, smoke cigars, read books, write letters, paint pictures, smell fragrances, or do nothing but listen. Feel how all of your senses are connected - what you see, taste and hear is all part of your musical gestalt here in the listening room.

Fashion, band names, and album art enlarge the artists ego, music video brightens their star, concert staging brings mythological stature, costumes project vigor and advertise status, disc element gains legitimacy when the audience sees a human manipulating the soundscape live. In the process the perception of &quot;DJ&quot; becomes expanded/redefined. This raising of the bar would go a long way towards the day when the obsolete term &quot;DJ&quot; is replaced with a more suitable title that genuinely reflects the diverse roles and skills involved in presenting music in the modern world. Today anyone, from those who can beatmix two records to those who press buttons and speak the time and temperature call themselves a &quot;DJ&quot;. The term as a whole has become all too generic, limiting and misunderstood. We need a new way to classify and recognize those with skills that go beyond the general dictionary definition.</p><p>We need to have a clear understanding that a DJ and those artistic professionals who embody part mixer/remixer, part engineer, part sound manipulator, part musician, part producer, part programmer are as different as night and day.
