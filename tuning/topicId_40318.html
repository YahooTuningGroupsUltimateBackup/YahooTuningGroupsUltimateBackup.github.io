And yet the possibility of<br/>a universal harmony, encompassing everything from atomic<br/>particles to celestial bodies, seems more real than ever...<br/>Is there order among the planets?  Or, as Pythagoras once<br/>put it, is there Music in the spheres?</p><p>Pythagoras is believed to have been the first person ever<br/>to demonstrate a connection between music and geometry.<br/>In the sixth century B.C. he discovered that using a finger<br/>to divide a harp string precisely in half produces a tone<br/>exactly an octave higher.  This in turn led him to theorize<br/>that, because of this obvious geometry in the humming of<br/>the strings, there must conversely be music in the spacing<br/>of the spheres.&quot;</p><p>==========================================================<br/>From:  Bill Arnold &lt;<a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/> Message 40186<br/>Date:  Sat Oct 26, 2002  3:52 pm<br/>Subject:  Re: MUSIC OF THE SPHERES</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/40137">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/40137</a></p><p>What I am suggesting IS that perhaps musicologists ought to<br/>INVESTIGATE the MATH and PHYSICS of NOTES, their FREQUENCY,<br/>their PERIOD, their PERIODICITY, and yes, in my way of SEEING it,<br/>whether or not...in their DISTANCES or RADIANS from their respective<br/>CENTERS and their respective VIBRATION ORBITALS. It is my firm belief,<br/>based on MATH and PHYSICS that the reason Pythagoras SAW what he did<br/>IS because there IS such a SIMILARITY between the DISTANCES between<br/>the planets as there are between the NOTES in the C Octave as I have<br/>suggested on this message board. We will get to that understanding,<br/>of verification or denial of it, only by investigation.</p><p>I, Bill Arnold, write: I believe that perhaps this is worthy of some<br/>discussion.  By calculations, atoms are shown to have SIZE: they have<br/>a CENTER or NUCLEUS and ORBITALS or PARTICLES moving round in an<br/>ENCLOSED SPACE. I SEE the SAME in the solar-planetary system and I SEE<br/>the SAME in DIFFRACTION PATTERNS of atoms as put forth years ago by<br/>Rutherford. It seems reasonable to me, because the MATH and PHYSICS<br/>of music is quantified, termed and defined, that a similarity probably<br/>EXISTS, theoretically, in music and awaits amplification.</p><p>I do NOT conclude that NOTES have NECESSARILY a CENTER and ORIBTALS,<br/>but WHY NOT?  Why should they defy the LAWS OF MATH and the LAWS OF<br/>PHYSICS and not have SIZE?<br/>====================================================================<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/40137">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/40137</a></p><p>wallyesterpaulrus wrote, &quot;sounds imaginative. like a dream.&quot;<br/>=====================================================================================<br/>Message 40207 From:  Charles Lucy &lt;<a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a>&gt;<br/>Date:  Sat Oct 26, 2002  10:45 pm<br/>Subject:  Music of The Spheres and Bill Arnold&apos;s numbers</p><p>I have read the papers that Bill Arnold sent me.<br/>My initial reaction is that the 0,3,6,9,12,24,48.96,192, 288, 384<br/>sequence is similar to the traditional harmonics series.<br/>In the following respective musical pattern related to frequency (e.g.<br/>in Hz.):<br/>(using integer ratio &quot;old&quot; traditional logic that harmonics don&apos;t beat<br/>i.e. Pythagorean)</p><p>3 = first Octave (3*1) e.g. C1<br/>6 = second octave (3*2) e.g. C2<br/>9 = second octave + fifth (3*3) or (6*(3/2)) e.g. G2<br/>12 = third octave (3*(2^2)) e.g. C3<br/>24 = fourth octave (3*8) e.g.C4<br/>48 = fifth octave (3*16) e.g. C5<br/>96 = sixth octave (3*32) e.g. C6<br/>192 = seventh octave (3*64) e.g. C7<br/>288 = seventh octave + fifth (3*76) or 192*(3/2)) e.g. G7<br/>384 = eighth octave (3*132) e.g. C8</p><p>This is simplistic, yet could suggest an octaving sequence.</p><p>Charles Lucy<br/><a href="http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/">http://www.harmonics.com/lucy/</a><br/>for Lucytuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>or <a href="http://www.lucytune.co.uk">http://www.lucytune.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p><p>===================================================================================<br/>My, Bill Arnold&apos;s, remarks:</p><p>So: are musicologists and astrophysicists speaking the same language?</p><p>If we compare mathematically, as Pythagoras suggested, and Murchie<br/>summarized: &quot;the obvious geometry in the humming of the strings, there<br/>must conversely be music in the spacing of the spheres.&quot;</p><p>WHAT precisely are we seeking to compare mathematically?

Here it is:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/monz/solarsystem/Solar2.mid">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/monz/solarsystem/Solar2.mid</a></p><p>There&apos;s not a lot of difference, but to my ears, this version is<br/>a bit more strident, and brings out the &apos;major chord&apos; quality<br/>of the orbital-period ratios even more strongly.</p><p>Thru my speakers, I can&apos;t hear Pluto or Neptune at all, and<br/>can just barely discern Uranus at the bottom and Mercury at<br/>the top when I turn off all the other planets.  I&apos;ll leave<br/>these four planets out of my analysis.</p><p>The &apos;major chord&apos; effect is due mainly to Saturn, Jupiter, and<br/>Venus, with Mars reinforcing Saturn 4 &apos;8ves&apos; higher.  Earth<br/>adds most of the piquancy with a pseudo-&apos;major 7th&apos;.</p><p>So the aural effect (at least as I hear it; &apos;your mileage may<br/>vary&apos;) causes Saturn to sound as the 1/1 - it is actually almost<br/>exactly 3 &apos;8ves&apos; and a 135/128 5-limit &apos;semitone&apos;, or what Ellis<br/>called the &apos;larger limma&apos; (92 cents), above the inaudible Pluto.</p><p>Jupiter is 1 &apos;8ve&apos; and 375 cents higher than Saturn - pretty<br/>darn close to an &apos;8ve&apos; + 5/4.</p><p>Mars is about 37 cents below the 4th &apos;8ve&apos; above Saturn.  It&apos;s<br/>also 2 &apos;8ves&apos; and 788 cents above Jupiter.</p><p>Earth is 4 &apos;8ves&apos; and 1057 cents above Saturn - pretty close<br/>to one of my favorite intervals, an 11/6 &apos;neutral 7th&apos; (= 1049<br/>cents).  To my ears, the more important audible relationship is<br/>that between Mars and Earth: 1094 cents, only 6 cents wider than<br/>a 15/8 &apos;major 7th&apos;.  I think this stands out quite strongly in<br/>the chord.  Earth is also 3 &apos;8ves&apos; + 682 cents above Jupiter.</p><p>Venus is very high and bright, almost exactly a 13/8 above Earth<br/>(altho to my ears it really sounds a lot like an 8/5 &apos;minor 6th&apos;),<br/>an &apos;8ve&apos; + 735 cents above Mars, 4 &apos;8ves&apos; + 323 cents above<br/>Jupiter (pretty close to a 6/5 &apos;minor 3rd&apos;), and 5 &apos;8ves&apos; +<br/>698 cents (a nice meantone &apos;5th&apos;!) above Saturn.</p><p>Here&apos;s the more accurate data, which supercedes the tables in<br/>my original post:</p><p>            Orbital period<br/>            days       years</p><p>Mercury    87.969     0.24084<br/>Venus     224.701     0.615187<br/>Earth     365.256363  1.0<br/>Mars      686.98      1.8808<br/>Jupiter  4332.71     11.8621<br/>Saturn               29.458<br/>Uranus               84.01<br/>Neptune             164.79<br/>Pluto               248.54</p><p>The figure given for the Earth&apos;s orbital period is known as<br/>the &apos;sidereal year&apos;: the time it takes for the Earth to make<br/>a complete revolution with respect to the stars.

The solar year is 365.2421988<br/>days, or 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 45.9747 seconds.

Anybody remember the name??</p><p>I, J. Pehrson</p><p>Hi, Joe, and others.  I have sent my papers over the years round the<br/>world, and recently to a few members on these message boards.  One member<br/>who has them plans to put them online.  I will let him identify himself if<br/>he wishes.  I hope and anticipate he will put them on a site that is<br/>accessible in public archives.</p><p>In the interim, I would say that my papers discuss all that.  The fact that<br/>those who do not know better continue to &quot;dis&quot; Pluto does not take away from<br/>the math, nor the physics that I suggested explains the relatables in my<br/>published papers.</p><p>Briefly: aside from members reading my papers, I would say, others can &quot;dis&quot;<br/>all they want.  Pythagoras was right in the main.  I just changed the base<br/>of the arithmetic system from measuring using the astronomical unit,<br/>Sun 0, Earth 1, to an ORDINAL system of Sun 0, Mercury 1, calling my<br/>system: the solar unit system.  Given that, and some of the physics, I<br/>offered the thesis originally given by Pythagoras: the Sun is only part of<br/>the solar-planetary system, and therefore it is a misnomer to call it a<br/>solar system.</p><p>By including the planets in the name of the system, solar-planetary system,<br/>it leaves room to explain that the system is in accordance [in a chord<br/>dance :)] with a hull of the system.  Now that word hull is up for grabs.<br/>I am not going to go further than to say that the solar influence at some<br/>point ends in its dance with the planets.  Pluto might be on the edge.<br/>It might be inside the edge.  It might be outside the edge.  The math<br/>tells me what I surmised and published back in 1979 and I predicted that<br/>what they call the asteroid belt and I call Ceres* might be akin to what<br/>IS out on the edge of the system as we describe it: another Pluto* belt;<br/>and they, the astronomers, have a name for it: the K. belt, named after<br/>someone or something.  The point for me is that astronomers [star namers]<br/>seem to rule the roost and the astrophysicists [star physicists] seem to<br/>let the astronomers describe the solar system in astronomical units and<br/>make other statements, generally, that are back in the dark ages, by my<br/>way of thinking.  They have ignored my papers for two decades, so what:<br/>me worry?</p><p>I had a nice correspondence, years ago, with Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer<br/>who found the planet Pluto in his telescope, years ago, and he was not<br/>happy with the &quot;dissing&quot; of his planet, and I agreed with him.  I still agree<br/>with him.  But then, he understood my point, that Cere* is a planet in the<br/>same way; inasumch as I was emphasizing the ORBITALS of the planets in a<br/>harmonic sequence and NOT the individual orbits.</p><p>This is so Key: it&apos;s beyond the comprehension of some.  Again, this is back<br/>to H.&apos;s Uncertainty Principle: in the former, we search for the mean data,<br/>statistically, over long periods of times, and statistically project ORBITALS,</p><p>and in the latter, we search for the particle in one orbit and project the<br/>singular PARTICLE or planet and its location at a particular place and time.</p><p>[I hope I am understood, but do not panic<br/>if I am not: I, admittedly, am a theorist.]</p><p>I stand by my papers: BODE&apos;S LAW EXPLAINED and ON THE SPECIAL THEORY OF ORDER.</p><p> Thanks in advance,<br/>meant kindly,</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/>billarnoldfla@y...<br/><a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm">http://www.cwru.edu/affil/edis/scholars/arnold.htm</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>HotJobs - Search new jobs daily now<br/><a href="http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/">http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/</a></p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2002 9:34:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Bill Arnold &lt;billarnoldfla@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/40334">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/40334</a></p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; By including the planets in the name of the system, solar-planetary<br/>system, it leaves room to explain that the system is in accordance<br/>[in a chord dance :)] with a hull of the system.
