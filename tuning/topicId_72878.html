I don&apos;t see any point in<br/>&gt; &gt; putting the 1.37 MB source file out there (full resolution, with<br/>&gt; &gt; lower compression), because I was hard pressed to see any<br/>&gt; &gt; significant differences between the two, zoomed in to 100%.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The problem is if anyone wants to edit it in the future, the<br/>&gt; compression artifacts are cumulative.
