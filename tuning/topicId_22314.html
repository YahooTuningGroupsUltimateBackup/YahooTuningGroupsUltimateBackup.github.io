I&apos;ll post you a copy of<br/>their paper if you are interested in learning more.</p><p>Basically their theory is that the human auditary system finds melodies in small<br/>whole number ratios too simple for any enjoyment. So rather than selecting notes<br/>that are directly related to DO or 1/1 we hear melodies tuned [in just ratios]<br/>to chains of reference.</p><p>They propose 12 basic ratios 1/1, 9/8, 7/6, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3,<br/>7/4, 9/5.<br/>These ratios are transposed 4 times [sometimes more] in three different schemes.<br/>What they term a major linkage which transposes the previous basic scale by a<br/>chain of 3/2&apos;s, a minor linkage that transposes the same scale by an initial 6/5<br/>and a blue reference chain that begins with an initial 5/4 and then a further 3<br/>transpositions by 3/2.</p><p>They came upon this melodic matrix by empirical testing of musicians. That is<br/>the theory was their logical organisation of the data retrieved through<br/>experiments.</p><p>The way this matrix works for melodic intonation is a melody will begin using<br/>the above scale and then as the melody progresses the the reference changes<br/>going further away from the initial 1/1. This provides the drive towards<br/>resolution at the end of the piece. It should be emphasised that there is no<br/>change of key. Often ones from different references are played against each<br/>other. To chage key this whole matrix would need to be transposed to a new<br/>initial DO.</p><p>What I am proposing is an electronic keyboard that uses two pedals [or pitch<br/>wheel with stops on each reference] to move forwards and backwards in the chain<br/>of reference. There would be a selector button to choose either the major,<br/>minor, or blue reference. Also there would be a harmonic duodene array above the<br/>normal keyboard. This duodene would be used to change keys. Although I hazard<br/>that real keychanges are far less common in music than we think [I feel most<br/>keychanges can be accomplished without retuning the whole matrix. This way there<br/>is drive for reslolution on the initial 1/1].</p><p>The melody in this system would be the unchanging factor. Chords would<br/>adaptively tune around the melody note [similar to babershop where the lead does<br/>the least adptive tuning].</p><p>I haven&apos;t exactly worked out what notes the chords will retune to but it will be<br/>context specfic. It will depend on what other notes are currently sounding. For<br/>instance if C, E, G &amp; B are sounding as a chord the tuning will be<br/>1/1,5/4,3/2,15/8       but if say the chord is C, Eb, G, B then it will be tuned<br/>1/1, 6/5, 3/2, 9/5.</p><p>&gt;&gt;There is one problem though.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Is it possible for a computer to identify the notes of a melody. That<br/>&gt;&gt;is to pick out notes of a melody from the simultaneously sounding<br/>&gt;&gt;harmonies.</p><p>&gt;I think it is the exception for there to be a clear distinction between<br/>&gt;melody and harmony, at least in the music I listen to and tune.</p><p>&gt;&gt;To do this we need to catalogue the characteristics  of a melody. We<br/>&gt;&gt;need to find out those things that, in particular, differentiate a<br/>&gt;&gt;melody from harmonic support.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Firstly there is tessitura, or the range in which the pitches are<br/>&gt;&gt;played. These genrally  conform to a fairly restricted range for most<br/>&gt;&gt;melodies. Generally two octaves is sufficient to play most melodies.<br/>&gt;&gt;This then is one way that a computer could narrow down the choices of<br/>&gt;&gt;sounding notes to decide on the melody note.</p><p>&gt;So much music bounces motifs among many voices, some high and some low.</p><p>&gt;&gt;But of course it is quite likely that there will be harmony of some<br/>&gt;&gt;sort in the same tessitura as the melody.</p><p>&gt;Absolutely.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Are there any other ways that a melody differs from harmony?</p><p>&gt;&gt;Perhaps the proportion between the speed of movement of the melody and<br/>&gt;&gt;the harmony. Generally speaking again melodies move faster in<br/>&gt;&gt;proportion to melodies.</p><p>&gt;You mean, in proportion to harmonies?  That is often true some of the<br/>&gt;time, but it can suddenly change, too.</p><p>Yes sorry for the mistake.</p><p>&gt;&gt;This is something a computer could also measure.</p><p>&gt;&gt;However these characteristics are hardly enough. There must be more<br/>&gt;&gt;elements to melodies that could be noticed by a computer.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Any ideas?</p><p>&gt;At the risk of being Captain Bringdown, it doesn&apos;t seem to me to be<br/>&gt;theoretically possible to make such a distinction.  But if it IS<br/>&gt;possible, what would your method do with the information?  That is,<br/>&gt;how does whether a note is melody vs. harmony affect the way you would<br/>&gt;adaptively tune it?</p><p>While reading your post I have though up two solutions to the problem of<br/>separating  melody from harmony. One is to have two keyboards [lefthand:<br/>harmony, righthand:melody] on one keyboard you would play the melody while on<br/>the other you would play the harmony. The melody keyboard would be monophonic<br/>and it&apos;s output would provide the basis for the polyphonic harmony keyboard to<br/>adaptively tune to. The melody keyboard could be either a standard keyboard with<br/>the reference chains operated via pedals or could be a Bosanquet style keyboard<br/>so that all the melody notes could be at hand.</p><p>Haresh wrote:</p><p>&lt;I am thinking about Indian music, which is only melody: Is the method<br/>&lt;for adaptive training ready to be put to use?</p><p>No at this stage I&apos;m only thinking about how to make it work the way I want. So<br/>at this stage there is no software or little black box. But once I get some<br/>feedback I&apos;ll start on a prototype synth. I just have to work out if there any<br/>tuning theory problems that need to be ironed out first.</p><p>There are however 4 software programs that do adaptive tuning to some degree.<br/>They are are very own John de Laubenfels JIRelay [windows], Justonics Pitch<br/>Palette [windows &amp; mac], Realtime tuner [mac only] and another one which is a<br/>softsynth. Ican&apos;t remember the name though.</p><p>My method as proposed should work with Indian music. But Haresh what did you<br/>want the software or keyboard to do ? As I see it there would be two ways of<br/>approaching Indian music using adaptive tuning. One would be two keep the melody<br/>static and have harmonies adaptively tuning around it or you could allow the<br/>scale to retune in relation to different tonics. All the products listed<br/>previously can do the latter. I know JIRelay and Realtime tuner can do the<br/>former but I am unsure as to the other two.</p><p>Justin</p></div><h3><a id=22357 href="#22357">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2001 10:24:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Justin White&quot; &lt;justin.white@d...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22314.html#22356">/tuning/topicId_22314.html#22356</a></p><p>&gt; What I envisage is based on the research of Boomsliter and<br/>&gt; Creel who came up with a theory for melodic intonation in<br/>&gt; the 1960&apos;s.

As<br/>I see it there would be two ways of approaching Indian music using<br/>adaptive tuning. One would be two keep the melody static and have<br/>harmonies adaptively tuning around it or you could allow the scale to<br/>retune in relation to different tonics. All the products listed<br/>previously can do the latter. I know JIRelay and Realtime tuner can<br/>do the former but I am unsure as to the other two. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Hi Justin,  actually, BOTH.  The first, keeping the melody static and<br/>have harmonies adaptively tuning around it.  My experiments and<br/>meanderings in the genre which has come to be called &quot;World Music&quot;,<br/>show that this has great potential for introducing JI in this genre.</p><p>The second, where you could allow the scale to retune in relation to<br/>different tonics, has, again, a very significant application in the<br/>field of research in Indian classical music.  This takes me directly<br/>to &quot;extended reference&quot; [B &amp; C].  I suspect that we have been using<br/>extended reference, by dwelling on the vadi, and then samvadi, and<br/>weaving patterns around them, during the raga improvisation.  This<br/>would be very much like &quot;in relation to different tonics&quot; that you<br/>refer to, above.  I have had a little offlist exchange of views with<br/>Paul on this topic.  Going back and forth between the tonic &quot;Sa&quot;, and<br/>the &quot;new tonic&quot;, the vadi/samvadi, may throw new light on how &quot;rasa&quot;<br/>(aesthetic emotions) works in Indian classical music.</p><p>Your comments, please?<br/>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=22435 href="#22435">ðŸ”—</a>Justin White &#x3C;justin.white@davidjones.com.au&#x3E;</h3><span>5/10/2001 8:41:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Kraig ,</p><p>&gt;Justin!<br/>&gt;    I am likewise a big B&amp;C fan<br/>&gt;see below</p><p>Good to hear it !</p><p>&gt;Justin White wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; What I am proposing is an electronic keyboard that uses two pedals [or pitch<br/>&gt;&gt; wheel with stops on each reference] to move forwards and backwards in the<br/>chain<br/>&gt;&gt; of reference. There would be a selector button to choose either the major,<br/>&gt;&gt; minor, or blue reference. Also there would be a harmonic duodene array above<br/>the<br/>&gt;&gt; normal keyboard. This duodene would be used to change keys. Although I hazard<br/>&gt;&gt; that real keychanges are far less common in music than we think [I feel most<br/>&gt;&gt; keychanges can be accomplished without retuning the whole matrix. This way<br/>there<br/>&gt;&gt; is drive for reslolution on the initial 1/1].<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The melody in this system would be the unchanging factor. Chords would<br/>&gt;&gt; adaptively tune around the melody note [similar to babershop where the lead<br/>does<br/>&gt;&gt; the least adptive tuning].</p><p>&gt;Interesting. and will enjoy hearing the results. It seems to me that these<br/>extended &gt;references<br/>&gt;might be what lead to the impulses of modulating in the first place. if so, one<br/>would &gt;tend to<br/>&gt;think that the adaptation route would water down the dynamics of the melody.</p><p>Absolutely ! The inclusion of the duodene method of key change as you have<br/>rightly noted would be pointless. To retune the whole referential matrix would<br/>make the new key&apos;s 1/1 just as restful and resolved as the previous key center.</p><p>I thought of including this option only because other people might want it. For<br/>myself I would never use it.</p><p>I prusume this is what you mean ? Beacause I don&apos;t think the barbershop method<br/>of bending chords to make them just in relation to the currently sounding melody<br/>would be in any way detriment to the dynamics of the melody. I say this because<br/>used in this way the B&amp;C melody system would not change at all it would be the<br/>rock around which the waters of harmony would bend.</p><p>&gt; It seems one could<br/>&gt;let the harmony be based on the same extended reference. Not saying you are<br/>right or &gt;wrong but<br/>&gt;just wanting to know how you ended up drawn to using it his way.</p><p>I have been using Justonics pitch palette software to achieve B&amp;C&apos;s reference<br/>matrix<br/>.With this software it is easy to use a retuning octace for keychange [used for<br/>cycling between different references] and another octave for choosing the tonic<br/>to which the chords sound. Unfortunatly sounding notes cannot be retuned and I<br/>am restricted to the notes of the B&amp;C melody scale for harmony. Major 7th can&apos;t<br/>be tuned. I wanted a separation between harmony and melody and the ability to<br/>retune sounding notes to achieve just chords all of the time. The only way I can<br/>accomplish this is with a hardware solution. No existing synth or sound card can<br/>accomplish this. I have thought of rewriting the operating system for my Ensoniq<br/>ASR-X as it does support the midi tuning standard [but not the retuning of<br/>sounding notes].</p><p>&gt;Erv&apos;s 17 tone scale has dealt with<br/>&gt;in<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/genus.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/genus.PDF</a> is his own solution to this problem.<br/>&gt;Erv did so layouts labeled Duodene  but can&apos;t seem to find it right now. will<br/>keep &gt;looking and it<br/>&gt;might already be up</p><p>Yes I was attracted to this scale.
