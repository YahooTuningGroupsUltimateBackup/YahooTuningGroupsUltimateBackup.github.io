But anyway, I believe Mozart did occasionally<br/>reinterpret German augmented sixths as dominant seventh, while Bach did not,<br/>so that&apos;s one excuse for using 4:5:6:7 for Mozart but not Bach.</p><p>&gt;One element is the commbination tones, another is something<br/>&gt;writen by Helmholtz.</p><p>Helmholtz preferred 16:19:24 for its combination tones. What is the other<br/>element? (To be, having the root of the chord octave-equivalent to the<br/>fundamental of the harmonic series seems important). However, in Bach&apos;s time<br/>10:12:15 (nearly) would still have appeared on many instruments, so I<br/>suggest you give it a chance.</p><p>&gt;I have never read about it<br/>&gt;before today!</p><p>Besides Helmholtz, Van Eck makes a point of the 16:19:24 chord in his book,<br/>_J.

I haven&apos;t yet found<br/>a sequence in which I prefer any other tuning.

In saying this, I&apos;m not trying to knock scholarly pursuits<br/>which aim to record exactly how things were, nor even performances that<br/>attempt maximum adherence to past practice; it&apos;s just that in my own<br/>work, I don&apos;t want to be anywhere but where everything from the past has<br/>the potential to be combined with the wonderful new tools we&apos;ve just<br/>been given in the present.</p><p>My guess is that 4:5:6:7 just takes getting used to (I didn&apos;t like it<br/>for the first year or so that I was adaptively tuning), but I don&apos;t<br/>mean that to sound arrogant - tastes may simply vary in this regard.</p><p>Minor chords I tune 10:12:15, and am reasonably happy.  I&apos;ve never tried<br/>16:19:24, but I do like 6:7:9 (the &quot;sub-minor&quot;).</p><p>JdL</p></div>
