One point I am realizing, however, is<br/>that the chains to get intervals such as 14/11 can be quite different<br/>than with related fifth generators! Thus 14/11 will be 3 generators<br/>up, rather than 20 (i.e. 4 fifths up) -- curiously, a kind of<br/>&quot;17-comma&quot; since it involves a difference of 17 generators!</p><p>As far as Turquoise 17, it is actually almost identical to 104-EDO --<br/>or 104-ED2, if we wish to emphasize that the octave is 2:1. While<br/>Turquoise is itself based on 1024-ED2, we can see it as a slightly<br/>irregular variation on the strictly linear 104-ED2, a &quot;shaggy&quot;<br/>variation one might say, rather like a Bouvier Bernois. Here is the<br/>33:36:39:42:44 division in 104-EDO which you discuss below in some<br/>possible shadings of Tsaharuk:</p><p>104-equal:    150.0   138.5  126.9   80.8<br/>just:         150.6   138.6  128.3   80.5<br/>              12:11   13:12  14:13   22:21<br/>            33  :  36   :  39  :  42   : 44<br/>            1/1   12/11   13/11  14/11   4/3<br/>  just:      0    150.6   289.2  417.5  498.0<br/>  104-equal  0    150.0   288.5  415.4  496.2</p><p>While 104-EDO, like Turquoise, is quite accurate for these ratios, it<br/>is notably less so for 3/2 (703.846 cents), 4/3, or 9/8 (207.692<br/>cents) than the various Tsaharuk shadings you discuss below.</p><p>For the curious, here is a version of Turqouoise in 104-ED2:</p><p>! turquoise17-104ed2.scl<br/>!<br/>Turquoise 17 in 104-tET/ED2, ~33:36:39:42:44 at steps 0 7 10<br/> 17<br/>!<br/> 69.23077<br/> 150.00000<br/> 207.69231<br/> 288.46154<br/> 357.69231<br/> 415.38462<br/> 496.15385<br/> 565.38462<br/> 646.15385<br/> 703.84616<br/> 784.61539<br/> 853.84616<br/> 911.53846<br/> 992.30769<br/> 1061.53846<br/> 1119.23077<br/> 2/1</p><p>&gt;  For one thing, Tsaharuk offers all distinctions needed between<br/>&gt;  12/11, 13/12 and 14/13 (those intervals, and their variations,<br/>&gt;  belong to those wanted by Julien Jalaleddine Weiss). They simply<br/>&gt;  differ by one equal step (= 12, 11, 10 steps in 94-edo).</p><p>Yes, we have in 94-equal:</p><p>12 153.2 cents 11 140.4 cents<br/>10 127.7 cents</p><p>&gt;  Then when from &quot;central Tsaharuk&quot;, which would be between the<br/>&gt;  schismatic and the pure fifth circles, you get closer to the 17-edo<br/>&gt;  ring (I refer to the Tsaharuk parametric horagram I mentionned<br/>&gt;  before, that can be found in my TL folder), you extend gradually<br/>&gt;  from more or less pure fifths to the ones you use in Turquoise,<br/>&gt;  while you reach better approximations of both 14/13 and 12/11, and<br/>&gt;  keep acceptable approximations of 13/12.</p><p>What is clear to me is that Tsaharuk is a very subtle and intricate<br/>system, going far beyond Turquoise or any similar tuning. Looking at<br/>your horagram, I see generators for the schismatic and pure fifth<br/>circles, as well as others including 2^11/94 -- a &quot;septimal<br/>schismatic&quot; circle, as I mention below. Clearly your system is a<br/>kind of magnificent tribute to Julien which does honor to you both.</p><p>One point here is that in Turquoise or 104-ED2, 14/13 is approximated<br/>by the regular apotome or 7 fifths up -- but 9/8 is over twice as<br/>impure as 14/13! In Tsaharuk, as you observe, 14/13 is 18 generators<br/>up, or a generator less the &quot;17-comma.&quot;</p><p>Here I give your corrected version of the Tsaharuk generators for<br/>neutral seconds:</p><p>&gt; Sorry, I just inversed of the order of the neutral seconds here :</p><p>&gt; the mapping of [33:36:39:42:44] is [0, -16, -15, 3, -5] tsaharuk<br/>&gt; generators, in all its variations.</p><p>&gt;  There can be found some notable microtemperament versions : 94-edo<br/>&gt;  (12 - 11 - 10 - 6 steps for the [33:36:39:42:44] division) will<br/>&gt;  offer perhaps the best average approximations for 12/11, 13/12 and<br/>&gt;  14/13, and the best 14/13</p><p>This would be:</p><p>94-equal      153.2   140.4  127.7   76.6<br/>just:         150.6   138.6  128.3   80.5<br/>              12:11   13:12  14:13   22:21<br/>            33  :  36   :  39  :  42   : 44<br/>            1/1   12/11   13/11  14/11   4/3<br/>  just:      0    150.6   289.2  417.5  498.0<br/>  94-equal   0    153.2   293.6  421.3  497.9</p><p>An interesting point of symmetry is that just as your horagram shows a<br/>generator for a 5-limit schismatic temperament, so 94-ED2 provides a<br/>septimal schismatic temperament for virtually pure fifths and near-pure<br/>ratios of 7/6, 7/4, and 9/7! These two schismatic shadings, along with<br/>the pure fifths, are what I take to be &quot;central Tsaharuk.&quot;</p><p>&gt;  111-edo (14 - 13 - 12 - 7 steps) and<br/>&gt;  128-edo (16 - 15 - 14 - 8 steps)<br/>&gt;  will  have about equally the best 12/11 approximations</p><p>These would be:</p><p>111-equal:    151.3   140.5  129.7   75.7<br/>just:         150.6   138.6  128.3   80.5<br/>              12:11   13:12  14:13   22:21<br/>            33  :  36   :  39  :  42   : 44<br/>            1/1   12/11   13/11  14/11   4/3<br/>  just:      0    150.6   289.2  417.5  498.0<br/>  111-equal  0    151.3   291.9  421.6  497.3</p><p>128-equal:    150.0   140.6  131,2   75.0<br/>just:         150.6   138.6  128.3   80.5<br/>              12:11   13:12  14:13   22:21<br/>            33  :  36   :  39  :  42   : 44<br/>            1/1   12/11   13/11  14/11   4/3<br/>  just:      0    150.6   289.2  417.5  498.0<br/>  128-equal  0    150.0   290.6  421.9  496.9</p><p>A curious point is that Turquoise has as one of its generators the<br/>fifth of 128-equal at 703.125 cents -- 75 steps of 128 or 600 of 1024.<br/>This provides fifths closer to pure than in 104-equal at certain<br/>locations -- although less pure fifths of 704.297 cents at others!</p><p>&gt;  145-edo (18 - 17 - 16 - 9 steps) will have the closest fifth<br/>&gt;  (703.448275 c.) to your Turquoise temperament.</p><p>This would be:</p><p>145-equal:    149.0   140.7  132,4   74.5<br/>just:         150.6   138.6  128.3   80.5<br/>              12:11   13:12  14:13   22:21<br/>            33  :  36   :  39  :  42   : 44<br/>            1/1   12/11   13/11  14/11   4/3<br/>  just:      0    150.6   289.2  417.5  498.0<br/>  145-equal  0    149.0   289.7  422.1  496.6</p><p>&gt; the mapping of [33:36:39:42:44]  is &gt; [0, -16, -15, 3, -5] tsaharuk generators, &gt; in all its variations.</p><p>This is an important point. When I first looked at the example in<br/>145-ED2, I wondered if there was some &quot;inconsistency,&quot; since with a<br/>fourth of 496.55 cents or so, 14/11 should be around 414 cents rather<br/>than 422 cents. However, looking at the Tsaharuk mapping made me<br/>realize that 14/11 will be three generators up rather than 20!</p><p>&gt; For example, with a 140.7 cents generator &gt; (= a fifth of 703.5 c.), and pure octaves,<br/>&gt; [33:36:39:42:44]  is approximated by : &gt; 0, 148.8, 289.5, 422.1,   496.5 cents</p><p>A curious point is that 13/11 at -15 generators is the same as the<br/>usual diatonic mapping of -3 fifths -- but 14/11 is different, as is<br/>22/21 at -8 generators rather than -25 (-5 fifths).</p><p>&gt; if compared to Turquoise&apos;s  0, 151.17187, 289.45313, 416.01563,   496.875 cents,<br/>&gt; Turquoise is closer to 13-limit JI :  0, 150.637, 289.2097,  417,508, 498,045<br/>&gt; but Tsaharuk will have other advantages, as a linear temperament.</p><p>Yes, with the generally purer fifths as one very important advantage.</p><p>&gt; A fifth of 703.5 c. is close to what we get in a 145-edo microtemperament<br/>&gt; (703.448275 c.)<br/>&gt; and even closer is the algebraic solution of the sequence<br/>&gt; x^10 = 3x - 1  (140.69789471196 c.,<br/>&gt;  generating a fifth of 703.4894735598 c.),<br/>&gt; expressing the equal-beating of 9/8 and 13/8.</p><p>Of course, the accuracy of 9/8 is a critical advantage of this shade<br/>of Tsaharuk temperament, or Secor&apos;s 29-HTT at 703.579 cents, where 9/8<br/>and 14/13 are equally impure and 63/52 thus pure, as opposed to<br/>Turquoise or similar systems which are comparable in the impurity of<br/>the fifths to 12n-equal, although in the opposite direction!</p><p>&gt; Other useful Tsaharuk sequences with extended fifths :</p><p>&gt; x^21 = 2x^10 + 1  near 128-edo  (140.63340515328 c.)<br/>&gt; x^21 = x^5 + 4   near 111-edo   (140.54922573072 c.)<br/>&gt; x^29 = 4x^6 + 4  near 94-edo    (140.4134555676 c.)</p><p>Your discussion above gives an idea of the neutral steps in these<br/>sequences -- although I realize that Tsaharuk deals with far more than<br/>this. Julien&apos;s desire for pure fifths and 5-limit thirds are two very<br/>relevant parameters satisfied by &quot;central Tsaharuk,&quot; for example.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
