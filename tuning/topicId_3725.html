The six<br/>&gt;intervals in this chord are:<br/>&gt;<br/>&lt;-&gt;snip&lt;-&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;One cannot tune the chord in JI and have all the intervals listed in the<br/>&gt;rightmost column. The best one can do is to use 28:25 instead of 9:8; then<br/>&gt;the other five intervals can be just as shown. 28:25 is a 25-limit interval<br/>&gt;but is clearly a case where the limit is of far less importance than the<br/>&gt;proximity to simpler ratios. It is 196 cents, and has a fairly clear<br/>&gt;interpretation as an 8-cent flat 9:8, but it might also be heard as a<br/>&gt;14-cent sharp 10:9. Tuning it closer to 9:8 would increase its consonance<br/>&gt;and the 72-tET version shown here does so with minimal damage to the other<br/>&gt;intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So the &quot;magic chord&quot; is, allowing for intervals to be tempered by up to 4<br/>&gt;cents, a saturated 9-limit chord. Similarly, the augmented triad in 12-tET<br/>&gt;is, allowing intervals to be tempered by up to 14 cents, a saturated 5-limit<br/>&gt;chord. Neither of these chords can be expressed adequately in just<br/>&gt;intonation.</p><p>I agree that there are consonant chords which do not have a natural expression in JI.  But have you actually compared the two versions of this chord?  I did, in root position, and they sounded almost exactly alike.  Certainly they shared the same VF.  In no way did the 72tET version sound more consonant, in fact the just version sounded a little smoother.  I doubt anyone would resent the substitution of one of these chords for the other in a reasonably-paced piece of music.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=3741 href="#3741">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
