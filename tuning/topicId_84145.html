It does sort of come in handy when you<br/>realize that the names &quot;subminor&quot;, &quot;supermajor&quot;, &quot;semi-____&quot; and<br/>&quot;sesqui-____&quot; all start with s, so perhaps we could keep up with your<br/>convention and let a little &quot;s&quot; stand for subminor or semi-___, and<br/>let a capital &quot;S&quot; stand for &quot;supermajor&quot; or &quot;sesqui-____&quot;. So a<br/>subminor third would be sm3, a supermajor third would be SM3, a<br/>semiaugmented 4 would be sa4, and a semidiminished 5 would be sd5. A<br/>sesqui-augmented fifth would be SA5, a sesqui-diminished 5 would be<br/>SD5, etc. Actually, now that I&apos;m typing it, I realize that it might<br/>end up being confusing. Hm. When do you capitalize the &quot;A&quot; for<br/>augmented label and when don&apos;t you?</p><p>But I do like the &quot;sm&quot; for subminor and the &quot;SM&quot; for supermajor, with<br/>&quot;s&quot; and &quot;S&quot; possibly being further abbreviated versions of those. I&apos;d<br/>personally avoid the -/+ symbols any more; they&apos;re already used for<br/>too many things as it is. + can be an augmented chord, a raised<br/>interval in general, an 81/80 shift... When does the madness end?</p><p>&gt; Also, the subminor/septimal minor&apos;s interval class is not 2 1/2; it&apos;s 2<br/>&gt; 2/3. At least if it were up to me. &para;;&not;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~D.</p><p>I would certainly agree with septimal minor being 2 2/3. That&apos;s<br/>actually one of the main reasons I changed the naming from &quot;septimal<br/>minor&quot; to &quot;subminor&quot;: 2 1/2 steps could certainly be considered a type<br/>of &quot;subminor third&quot;, albeit an extremely narrow one. It&apos;s a pretty far<br/>stretch for 7/6, though.</p><p>As it stands, though, the box is pretty organized with its 24-tet<br/>approximations, and doesn&apos;t offer any inaccurate information I can<br/>tell of. If we want to make the box a bit more detailed, however, and<br/>go from the general &quot;subminor third of about 2.5 steps&quot; to the more<br/>detailed &quot;septimal minor third of about 2.66 steps&quot;, I&apos;m all for it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/19/2009 9:55:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; I do like the sm and SM.
