One<br/> &gt;interest is to demonstrate to students in a Sociology of Music  the<br/> &gt;differences in temperaments --- including the equal-tempered,<br/> &gt;well-tempered and mean-tone ones.  Due to the complexity of the<br/> &gt;topic, it would be valuable to add the experiential dimension to all<br/> &gt;this. &gt;&gt;</p></div>
