Silberman (Sixth Comma Mean Tone)</p><p>Gottfried Silbermann (1683-1753) a contemporary and fellow organ prover of<br/>J.S. Bach, was a famous German organ builder who also bilt clavichords and<br/>early piano-fortes.  As a kind of musical pun on his name he is noted for<br/>his silvery organ mixtures.  He was no lover of equal temperament in which<br/>his beautiful mixtures would not preserve their purity and clarity of tone<br/>and their blending qualities.  it is said that he was prevails upon to tune<br/>a few of his organs equally.  He was the first to popularise the Cornet stop<br/>which had five ranks (sometimes three in smaller organs), which contained<br/>tierce and quint pipes.  These multiple stops sound better in an unequal<br/>temperament, and in fact they were mostly removed from English organs after<br/>the introduction of equal temperament.  Twenty years after Silbermann&apos;s<br/>death the temperament he used was recorded with remarkable accuracy by the<br/>German organist Georg A. Sorge who played two Silbermann organs in<br/>Th&uuml;ringen.</p><p>This temperament is a regular mean tone type in which eleven fifths are<br/>equally flattened by 1/6-th Pythagorean comma, leaving a small wolf fifth<br/>G#Eb sharp by 5/6-th comma (19.54 cents).  It corresponds closely with<br/>1/5-th Syntonic comma mean-tone because 1/6-th Pythagorean comma (3.91<br/>cents) is nearly iequal to 1/5-th Syntonic comma (4.30 cents).  Although<br/>producing eitht reasonably good thirds, four are very sharp (by 29.33 cents)<br/>which results in four major and four minor scales being very badly<br/>intonated, three of the four major scales being unusable.  It is thus a<br/>restricted temperament in which it is not possible to play in all keys.<br/>There is also no different key flavour amongst the good keys.</p><p>J.S. Bach is known to have played on Silbermann organs (Sumner 1966) and<br/>would have experienced this tempering.  It is interesting that on the face<br/>of it the keys in which Bach wrote his organ works avoid teh bad keys in<br/>this temperament.  However, the degree of modulation used in his<br/>compositions means that badly intonated invervals are frequently met with,<br/>which results in some very rough sounding intervals.  In general J.S. Bach&apos;s<br/>organ works do not sound well in any restricted temperament with a<br/>pronounced wolf, but sound better in an unrestricted good temperament.<br/>[These are all terms that Padgham has defined in earlier chapters.]</p><p>However, as Lange (Lange 1972-3) points out Bach could have exploited the<br/>bad intervals for extreme musical expression, for example by deliberately<br/>using the Wolf.  He quotes a number of examples including the A flat major<br/>chorale in the St Matthew Passion, this key being the harshest in most mean<br/>tone tunings.</p><p>[I&apos;ll skip the Tuning Procedure and just give the cents values here.]</p><p>0<br/>86.31<br/>196.09<br/>305.86<br/>392.18<br/>501.96<br/>588.27<br/>698.04<br/>784.36<br/>894.14<br/>1003.91<br/>1090.22<br/>1200.00</p><p>The temperings in the circle of fifths are:</p><p>C -1/6P G -1/6P D -1/6P A -1/6P E -1/6P B -1/6P F# -1/6P C# -1/6P G# Wolf<br/>(+5/6P) Eb -1/6P Bb -1/6P F -1/6P C</p><p>The references given are as follows:</p><p>Sumner W.L. 1966 &quot;The organs played by Bach&quot;, Eighth Music Book, 2nd<br/>Edition.

A. Mathieu&apos;s book _The Harmonic Experience_<br/>and tuning issues (in particular, 31 notes)</p><p>As a private student of Mathieu, he&apos;s personally gone over most of this<br/>book with me, and corrected many of my misunderstandings of it--so I<br/>think the below is a good (but very summary) representation of the<br/>author&apos;s intention.</p><p>Mathieu&apos;s approach to harmony is fundamentally about coming to hear how<br/>12-tone equal-temperment can _represent_ 5 and/or 7-limit just<br/>intonation.  For example, if you play a C major triad, and then an E<br/>major triad, and then a C major triad, and then a Ab major triad, then<br/>the G# and the Ab are the same key on a 12-tet keyboard, but the G# is<br/>heard as representing 25/16 while the Ab is heard as representing 8/5.</p><p>The real magic comes, though, when you play CMajor, EMajor, AbMajor,<br/>CMajor, because a big zap occurs when the same equal-tempered note<br/>changes from representing 25/16 G# to 8/5 Ab.</p><p>So, from an hearing perspective, it&apos;s about hearing what<br/>just-intonation harmony is being represented in an equal-tempered<br/>harmonic progressions, and especially hearing how notes are modulating<br/>from representing one just-intonation note to another.</p><p>The final element to the mix is symmetrical harmony, such as whole tone<br/>or symetrical diminished harmony, because this type of harmony<br/>_depends_ upon the equal-spacing of 12-tet to work.  So, for example,<br/>if you play the notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C-Bb-Ab-F#-E-D-E-F#-G-A-B-C#-D,<br/>somewhere in there, between Bb and F#, is distributed the sensation of<br/>modulating from 5-limit just harmony in C to symmetrical 12-tet, and<br/>then to 5-limit just harmony in D.</p><p>Now, Mathieu outlines in the book the 31 just intervals which are<br/>easiest to represent in 12-tet.  For example, while the Great Deisis<br/>above is easy to play in 12-tet, it is almost impossible to create a<br/>pythagorean comma, because this would require modulating through 12<br/>keys fast enough that sense memory would remember the first key you<br/>played.</p><p>So, although Mathieu is a fan of alternative tunings, was a student of<br/>Easley Blackwood, author of &quot;The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic<br/>Tunings&quot;, and can sing (and expects his students to be able to sing) 31<br/>just intervals, tuning-wise he is a big fan of 12-tet harmony with<br/>variable-pitch solo instruments that can hone in on the just-intoned<br/>intervals being represented, or ensembles such as Renaissance singers,<br/>who can adjust there harmony continously to be in just-intonation,<br/>without being limited to only being perfectly in tune in one key.</p><p>I love this group!</p><p>Louis</p></div><h3><a id=44371 href="#44371">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2003 6:48:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;The problem is mostly with the strings.

Sometimes an<br/>alternative key, or fingering (called false fingerings by some) has a slightly<br/>different pitch which can be useful if there is a tendency for a note to be either<br/>sharp or flat.  Every note has its tendencies to be either sharp or flat,<br/>sometimes occurring before the instrument has been warmed up, or as a result of a<br/>particular reed.  There are usually timbral differences as well, but this too<br/>can be valuable such as when needing a bigger tone or a darker tone.</p><p>Flutes can change pitch by rolling the flute to the mouth.  Open hole flutes<br/>(most used by professionals) offer the most possibilities (which is why Robert<br/>Dick had an open hole bass flute made).</p><p>Clarinets start flat and bassoons start sharp.  Clarinets can change reeds<br/>and barrels for tuning.  Bassoons don&apos;t tune up at all.  These instruments<br/>require a &quot;resonance pocket&quot; for optimum timbre, the pitch is then adjusted<br/>afterwards, as regards training.  Beginners don&apos;t have the &quot;resonance pocket&quot; to be<br/>in tune accurately.</p><p>Bassoon tuning comes from a multitude of different techniques, only possible<br/>when the mind &quot;hears&quot; the exact tuning, which takes many years for<br/>&quot;conventional&quot; 12-tET.<br/>Even assuming that the instrument is in perfect repair, if one was to simply<br/>&quot;press and blow&quot; the sound would be horrendous.  There is a different mental<br/>placement as well as an inner shape for each note.  There is a different mental<br/>placement and inner shape for each trill, and even for legato connections of<br/>all sizes.</p><p>Other tuning techniques for bassoon, and applicable to other woodwinds such<br/>as oboe and saxophone, include:<br/>1. partial shading, or &quot;depressings&quot; of keys<br/>2. partial covering of tone holes, keeping fingerings in contact with the<br/>stream of air<br/>3. glottal drops which lower pitches from a semitone to a whole tone,<br/>depending on  the unique characteristics of the note<br/>4. embouchure change (usually as a last result because one has to return to<br/>the choice embouchure soon after and this is difficult in faster passages)<br/>5. wind velocity changes<br/>6. alternative fingerings</p><p>There are no pitches which are impossible to play on woodwinds, though some<br/>are easier than others.

I only learned meantone from 12-tone contexts.  I&apos;m taking it that if<br/>you extend the equal tempering of the 5ths further, rather than allowing the<br/>wolf to enter by closing the circle at 12, then you get a pattern that goes<br/>through 55 steps before it repeats.  I hope your website below clarifies<br/>this non-12-tone interpretation of meantone.  Otherwise I&apos;d appreciate a<br/>good book reference.  (And apologies for probably not having the<br/>&quot;prerequisites&quot; for this list!)</p><p>&gt; the key of the piece only plays a role in determining<br/>&gt; which particular subset of the overall tuning is used,<br/>&gt; and no, it&apos;s not limited to 12 pitch-classes, and anyway,<br/>&gt; the choice of pitches/tuning was already made by Mozart<br/>&gt; in his choice of notation.  55edo has an established<br/>&gt; (i.e., &quot;premeditated calculation&quot;) tuning and he chose<br/>&gt; particular notes from it in writing his pieces.  in<br/>&gt; the first movement of his 40th Symphony, he uses 19<br/>&gt; different pitches (based on the assumption that sharps<br/>&gt; are different from their &quot;enharmonically-equivalent&quot; flats).<br/>&gt; and it&apos;s fascinating to see how he limits his set of<br/>&gt; pitches for certain sections of the music, then expands<br/>&gt; the set at other places by adding new flats, etc.</p><p>So you are actually saying that Mozart expliclty used 55edo subsets and<br/>named those subsets when he wrote his pieces?  So he actually provided a<br/>mapping between 12-note plus sharp/flat notation and 55edo, specifically?<br/>(Probably this will get much clarified once I really understand meantone.)<br/>Now I have to really go read up on the greater-than-12 et stuff.  I&apos;m<br/>assuming now that all the common greater-than-12 et scales that have been<br/>discussed actually relate to various different meantone tunings, and this<br/>probably clarifies the relationship between standard notation and a<br/>greater-than-12 et &quot;interpretation&quot; (which probably becomes trivial, from<br/>what I&apos;m guessing now).

The strongest experience for me<br/>that I believe relates to this is with Messien&apos;s modulations.  Not<br/>specifically the tied C#/Db kind of thing, although I think these do occur<br/>sometimes, but chord changes where rather far shifts in scale are implied<br/>(to my ear).  (Excuse my language, I lack the fine-tuned terminology, so I<br/>try to make up for it with more words.)  The strange thing to me is to hear<br/>(on this list) that Messiaen was a &quot;equal tempered kind of guy&quot; (I forget<br/>from whom now).  I have not reconciled the relationship between octatonic<br/>and ordinary notation, so I go mostly by what my ears tell me.  Most of the<br/>Messiaen I have heard has been for organ, and almost all of that has been<br/>played using 12et.  In _spite_ of that limitation, I (somehow) hear<br/>modulations _strongly_ conveyed that break from 12et.  I swear I hear<br/>impossible things happening all the time.  This is somehow contextually<br/>implied by an entire sequence of chord progressions.  I am not sophisticated<br/>enough to explain it, by my the strong interpretation my ears give me is<br/>always implying nearly just intervals, and my listening is always being<br/>&quot;pushed around&quot; (requiring constant harmonic reorientation) by 12et Messiaen<br/>more strongly than any other music I know of.  So to me 12et has plenty of<br/>ambiguity that in Messiaen&apos;s hands allows for rich contextual harmonic<br/>expression.  I don&apos;t know how this relates to the use of octatonic, nor have<br/>I looked into non-12et interpretations of octatonic.

Also from what<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I am hearing, some other closed 12-tone system is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; probably being used.  Is that right?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; modern wind (woodwind and brass, but especially<br/>&gt; &gt; woodwind) and tuned percussion instruments are<br/>&gt; &gt; tuned to 12edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, this is slightly different from what I thought<br/>&gt; I was hearing, mainly between wallyesterpaulrus and<br/>&gt; Carl, in the 12 but not 12et discussions and<br/>&gt; clarifications.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but,<br/>&gt; &gt; and it&apos;s a BIG but, the embouchure (i.e., the<br/>&gt; &gt; setting and actions of the lips) has *everything*<br/>&gt; &gt; to do with the intonation of a wind instrument!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I got this from the previous threads.  So I<br/>&gt; am really asking not about the instruments&apos; tuning<br/>&gt; proclivities, but how they actually tend to be<br/>&gt; played.</p><p>that&apos;s a good distinction to make.  i was<br/>making the point that all of todays woodwinds<br/>are constructed with 12edo firmly and accurately<br/>*intended*.</p><p>this was *not* the case before c. 1820 or so.<br/>the older woodwinds, which were pretty much just<br/>tubes with holes in them, were tuned more-or-less<br/>to meantone.  when Boehm redesigned the flute and<br/>others (Triebert, oboe; Buffet, clarinet; Heckel,<br/>bassoon) followed suit, their intentions were<br/>threefold: 1) louder volume, 2) lots of keys,<br/>which made certain passages easier to play, and<br/>3) perfect 12edo tuning.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Now is where it gets less clear for me, so let me posit<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; some things, and I would appreciate some feedback on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; how well I guessed.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I am assuming that a given 12-tone system is probably<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; chosen for a given piece (or movement) informed at<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; _least_ by what key the piece is in, and that a really<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; sophisticated orchestra/conductor that is really familiar<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; with the origins of a particular piece might be chosing<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the 12-tone interpretation very carefully.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; good luck finding a conductor who&apos;s *that* sophisticated!<br/>&gt; &gt; as for a whole orchestra ... no way.  the vast majority<br/>&gt; &gt; of highly trained musicians know as much about tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; as your local garage-band guitarist ... and in fact,<br/>&gt; &gt; he may empirically know *more* about it! -- if he likes<br/>&gt; &gt; the blues, that probably *is* the case.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; my opinion is that the very best orchestras are<br/>&gt; &gt; playing in some kind of adaptive-tuning or adaptive-JI.<br/>&gt; &gt; in this case, yes, the key of the piece would play<br/>&gt; &gt; a large role in determining the tuning.  but again,<br/>&gt; &gt; the actual intonation is more a result of empirical<br/>&gt; &gt; experimentation or practice, and careful listening,<br/>&gt; &gt; than of any premeditated calculating.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, but has that process really been tainted by 12et<br/>&gt; over the last couple of centures, as some seem to<br/>&gt; indicate?  It seems much more likely that everybody<br/>&gt; has most likely been doing something &quot;adaptive&quot; for<br/>&gt; centuries.</p><p>*good* musicians hear subtle differences in intonation<br/>and adjust their playing, but they&apos;re a small minority<br/>if you consider *all* musicians.  i have a lot to say<br/>about the entrenchment of 12edo below, so yes, i would<br/>say that there&apos;s been a &quot;12edo taint&quot; for a few centuries.</p><p>&gt; &gt; in a more specific case, for example, the playing of<br/>&gt; &gt; a Mozart symphony in 55edo or some other meantone,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aha.  I only learned meantone from 12-tone contexts.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m taking it that if you extend the equal tempering<br/>&gt; of the 5ths further, rather than allowing the wolf<br/>&gt; to enter by closing the circle at 12, then you get<br/>&gt; a pattern that goes through 55 steps before it repeats.<br/>&gt; I hope your website below clarifies this non-12-tone<br/>&gt; interpretation of meantone.  Otherwise I&apos;d appreciate<br/>&gt; a good book reference.  (And apologies for probably<br/>&gt; not having the &quot;prerequisites&quot; for this list!)</p><p>you guess it right.  i go into more detail about it<br/>below.  if you look up &quot;meantone&quot; in the Tuning Dictionary<br/>and follow the links you&apos;ll get a lot of this info.<br/>play around with the &quot;mouse-over&quot; applets too.</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/meantone.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/meantone.htm</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; the key of the piece only plays a role in determining<br/>&gt; &gt; which particular subset of the overall tuning is used,<br/>&gt; &gt; and no, it&apos;s not limited to 12 pitch-classes, and anyway,<br/>&gt; &gt; the choice of pitches/tuning was already made by Mozart<br/>&gt; &gt; in his choice of notation.  55edo has an established<br/>&gt; &gt; (i.e., &quot;premeditated calculation&quot;) tuning and he chose<br/>&gt; &gt; particular notes from it in writing his pieces.  in<br/>&gt; &gt; the first movement of his 40th Symphony, he uses 19<br/>&gt; &gt; different pitches (based on the assumption that sharps<br/>&gt; &gt; are different from their &quot;enharmonically-equivalent&quot; flats).<br/>&gt; &gt; and it&apos;s fascinating to see how he limits his set of<br/>&gt; &gt; pitches for certain sections of the music, then expands<br/>&gt; &gt; the set at other places by adding new flats, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So you are actually saying that Mozart expliclty<br/>&gt; used 55edo subsets and named those subsets when he<br/>&gt; wrote his pieces?  So he actually provided a mapping<br/>&gt; between 12-note plus sharp/flat notation and 55edo,<br/>&gt; specifically? (Probably this will get much clarified<br/>&gt; once I really understand meantone.) Now I have to<br/>&gt; really go read up on the greater-than-12 et stuff.</p><p>Kurt, you&apos;re bringing up a lot of different subjects<br/>that have all been discussed at length here many<br/>times before.  it&apos;s not uncommon for this to happen<br/>when someone is a newcomer to this list.</p><p>first of all, no, Mozart never actually stated<br/>&quot;my pieces should be played in 55edo&quot;.  his father<br/>Leopold taught that violin intonation should divide<br/>the whole-tone into 9 commas, the &quot;diatonic semitone&quot;<br/>into 5 commas, and the &quot;chromatic semitone&quot; into 4.<br/>this works out to be 55edo.  Leopold also wrote<br/>approvingly to his son about Tosi&apos;s reccomendation<br/>of this tuning, and Mozart&apos;s student Thomas Atwood<br/>preserved notes which show that Mozart taught it<br/>to him.</p><p>if you&apos;ll take a look at the last graphic at<br/>the bottom of my 55edo webpage, you&apos;ll see<br/>that the space between C and D may be notated<br/>as follows:</p><p>C   Dbb Bbbbb Bx   C#   Db  Ebbb B###  Cx    D<br/>|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |</p><p>as you mentioned above, note that, because 55edo,<br/>along with all other EDOs, is a closed system, any<br/>of these notes can be considered &quot;enharmonically<br/>equivalent&quot; to others.  in this case, the enharmonic<br/>equivalent would be 55 steps away in the &quot;meantone<br/>cycle&quot;, i.e., in the chain of 5ths.  i&apos;ll illustrate ...</p><p>to ascend from one degree of 55edo to the next by<br/>counting 5ths in the &quot;circle of 5ths&quot;, you either<br/>subtract 12 or add 43: thus, if C is our reference<br/>point or zero position in both the circle of 5ths<br/>and the 55edo *scale* (both generator 0 and 2^(0/55) ),<br/>then the next higher degree of 55edo, 2^(1/55),<br/>which is exactly 21 &amp; 9/11 cents, will be notated<br/>as either generator -12 (Dbb) or generator +43 (Gxxx).</p><p>now, it&apos;s quite possible to find an occasional Dbb<br/>in a Mozart score, but i&apos;ll bet everything i own<br/>that he never once notated a Gxxx in any of his 600+<br/>compositions.  so therefore he never intended his<br/>entire musical pitch-universe to contain even half<br/>of the entire 55edo; in fact, Atwood&apos;s notes show<br/>that Mozart&apos;s set of pitches covered at most a<br/>21-tone chain of 5ths.  if these notes were arranged<br/>as a subset of a 55edo scale, it would have uneven<br/>gaps in it.</p><p>so look again at my diagram above.  let each pair of<br/>vertical lines represent the boundaries of a 55edo comma<br/>(21 &amp; 9/11 cents).  can you see how the interval from<br/>C to C# subtends 4 commas?  and Db to D is also 4 commas?<br/>these are &quot;chromatic semitones&quot;.</p><p>notice how C to Db and C# to D are both 5 commas.<br/>these are &quot;diatonic semitones&quot;, since there is a<br/>change of letter-name.  also note the single comma<br/>between C# and Db.</p><p>also note that these pitch differences extend beyond<br/>the realm of individual pitches and also into the<br/>realm of keys, so that the keys of Gb-major and<br/>F#-major are *not* the same, as they are in 12edo.</p><p>anyway, our musical notation did not develop in<br/>terms of 12edo, which was a relative latecomer.<br/>it developed originally in terms of Pythagorean<br/>tuning, and then in the late 1400s the European<br/>tuning paradigm shifted to meantone and the notation<br/>was adapted to fit that family of tunings.  this<br/>resulted in the curious switch i mentioned before,<br/>where C# used to be higher than Db but now became lower.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m assuming now that all the common greater-than-12<br/>&gt; et scales that have been discussed actually relate<br/>&gt; to various different meantone tunings, and this<br/>&gt; probably clarifies the relationship between standard<br/>&gt; notation and a greater-than-12 et &quot;interpretation&quot;<br/>&gt; (which probably becomes trivial, from what I&apos;m<br/>&gt; guessing now).  I&apos;ll look at the webpage you gave...</p><p>there are many EDOs which *do* belong to the meantone<br/>family, but there are lots of others which don&apos;t.</p><p>the first graphic here:</p><p><a href="http://sonic-arts.org/dict/eqtemp.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/dict/eqtemp.htm</a></p><p>shows how a bunch of different EDOs fit into<br/>various families of temperaments.  mouse-over the<br/>&quot;Zoom: 10&quot; link, and look along the yellow line<br/>labeled &quot;meantone&quot;: you&apos;ll see 12, 19, 26, 31, 33,<br/>43, 45, 50, 55, etc.  those are all EDOs which work<br/>as meantones.</p><p>but you&apos;ll also see that there are lots of other lines,<br/>with temperaments lying on those lines.  and every<br/>temperament belongs to several different families.</p><p>&gt; &gt; you can get an idea of this on my 55edo webpage,<br/>&gt; &gt; which opens with an mp3 of the beginning of the<br/>&gt; &gt; 40th Symphony in 55edo tuning:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/55edo/55edo.htm">http://sonic-arts.org/monzo/55edo/55edo.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; BIG DISCLAIMER: as paul erlich has argued, one cannot<br/>&gt; &gt; assume that Mozart *always* intended 55edo or meantone<br/>&gt; &gt; in general for his intonation.  there are many places<br/>&gt; &gt; in his compositions which use the type of enharmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; modulations being discussed right now in the &quot;observations<br/>&gt; &gt; on temperament&quot; thread, and which would preclude the<br/>&gt; &gt; use of *different* &quot;enharmonically-equivalent&quot; sharps/flats.<br/>&gt; &gt; in other words, if there&apos;s one chord with a C# and it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; tied to a Db in the next chord, paul would say that they<br/>&gt; &gt; have to be the same pitch.  i would disagree, because<br/>&gt; &gt; i don&apos;t mind small pitch shifts, but paul dislikes them<br/>&gt; &gt; strongly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Getting a little off-topic here, perhaps...<br/>&gt; The strongest experience for me that I believe<br/>&gt; relates to this is with Messien&apos;s modulations.<br/>&gt; Not specifically the tied C#/Db kind of thing,<br/>&gt; although I think these do occur sometimes, but<br/>&gt; chord changes where rather far shifts in scale<br/>&gt; are implied (to my ear).  (Excuse my language,<br/>&gt; I lack the fine-tuned terminology, so I try to<br/>&gt; make up for it with more words.)  The strange thing<br/>&gt; to me is to hear (on this list) that Messiaen was<br/>&gt; a &quot;equal tempered kind of guy&quot; (I forget from whom<br/>&gt; now).  I have not reconciled the relationship<br/>&gt; between octatonic and ordinary notation, so I go<br/>&gt; mostly by what my ears tell me.  Most of the<br/>&gt; Messiaen I have heard has been for organ, and<br/>&gt; almost all of that has been played using 12et.<br/>&gt; In _spite_ of that limitation, I (somehow) hear<br/>&gt; modulations _strongly_ conveyed that break from<br/>&gt; 12et.  I swear I hear impossible things happening<br/>&gt; all the time.  This is somehow contextually<br/>&gt; implied by an entire sequence of chord progressions.<br/>&gt; I am not sophisticated enough to explain it, by my<br/>&gt; the strong interpretation my ears give me is always<br/>&gt; implying nearly just intervals, and my listening is<br/>&gt; always being &quot;pushed around&quot; (requiring constant<br/>&gt; harmonic reorientation) by 12et Messiaen more<br/>&gt; strongly than any other music I know of.  So to<br/>&gt; me 12et has plenty of ambiguity that in Messiaen&apos;s<br/>&gt; hands allows for rich contextual harmonic expression.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know how this relates to the use of octatonic,<br/>&gt; nor have I looked into non-12et interpretations of<br/>&gt; octatonic.  The 4 repetitions within the octave seems<br/>&gt; to allow a break from some too-standard ways of<br/>&gt; riding the circle of fifths, and yet (to me)<br/>&gt; capitalizes on the relationships it is breaking from.</p><p>Messaien was certainly an original musical thinker,<br/>so i&apos;m not surprised at your reaction to hearing<br/>his pieces.</p><p>i could go on and on and say a lot here, but i<br/>want to be brief.  essentially, 12edo became the<br/>standard tuning during the 1900s because of a<br/>variety of factors, and chief among them was the<br/>fact that it fits into so many different families<br/>of temperaments that it enabled composers who sought<br/>a change of style to break out of old-fashioned<br/>tuning paradigms and explore new ones, without having<br/>to create a new tuning and suffer the consequent<br/>inability of finding instruments and performers to<br/>play it.</p><p>so, 12edo worked as a meantone (there&apos;s no audible<br/>difference between it and 1/11-comma meantone) which<br/>won it some early favor.  then, around the time of<br/>Beethoven and Schubert, composers began to modulate<br/>in patterns which:</p><p>1)<br/>assumed the diesis would vanish (&quot;diesic&quot; or<br/>&quot;augmented&quot; temperament), allowing them to use<br/>augmented triads in which a fourth note would<br/>be the same as the first; and</p><p>2)<br/>assumed that minor-3rds could be stacked into<br/>a diminished-7th tetrad where a fifth note would<br/>be the same as the first (diminished temperament).</p><p>i also noted in my last post that right at the beginning<br/>of Beethoven&apos;s career, an &quot;expressive intonation&quot; was<br/>beginning to be taught which resembled Pythagorean tuning.<br/>there is yet another family of temperaments to which<br/>12edo belongs, which emulates Pythagorean (Aristoxenean<br/>temperament).</p><p>in the later 1800s, Lizst and Ravel began exploring<br/>the octatonic scale, which is *also* possible in 12edo.<br/>this was picked up by Scriabin, Stravinsky, and others.<br/>(you mention &quot;non-12et interpretations of octatonic&quot;:<br/>16edo and 28edo are two good examples, as you can see<br/>on the &quot;equal temperament&quot; definition graphic.)</p><p>finally, in 1911, Schoenberg&apos;s _Harmonielehre_ expounded<br/>his ideas on using all 12 notes of 12edo without<br/>reference to keys, and 10 years later, his &quot;12-tone method&quot;<br/>set up a system of composing (serialism) which used<br/>12edo in this manner, and it became firmly entrenched<br/>in musical academia for the rest of the century.</p><p>&gt; &gt; i&apos;ve already touched on a lot of these points earlier<br/>&gt; &gt; in this post.  my position:  there are very few<br/>&gt; &gt; orchestras which display a really fine and subtle<br/>&gt; &gt; sense of intonation as a whole.

The strongest<br/>experience for me<br/>&gt; that I believe relates to this is with Messien&apos;s modulations.  Not<br/>&gt; specifically the tied C#/Db kind of thing, although I think these<br/>do occur<br/>&gt; sometimes, but chord changes where rather far shifts in scale are<br/>implied<br/>&gt; (to my ear).  (Excuse my language, I lack the fine-tuned<br/>terminology, so I<br/>&gt; try to make up for it with more words.)  The strange thing to me is<br/>to hear<br/>&gt; (on this list) that Messiaen was a &quot;equal tempered kind of guy&quot; (I<br/>forget<br/>&gt; from whom now).  I have not reconciled the relationship between<br/>octatonic<br/>&gt; and ordinary notation, so I go mostly by what my ears tell me.<br/>Most of the<br/>&gt; Messiaen I have heard has been for organ, and almost all of that<br/>has been<br/>&gt; played using 12et.  In _spite_ of that limitation, I (somehow) hear<br/>&gt; modulations _strongly_ conveyed that break from 12et.  I swear I<br/>hear<br/>&gt; impossible things happening all the time.  This is somehow<br/>contextually<br/>&gt; implied by an entire sequence of chord progressions.  I am not<br/>sophisticated<br/>&gt; enough to explain it, by my the strong interpretation my ears give<br/>me is<br/>&gt; always implying nearly just intervals, and my listening is always<br/>being<br/>&gt; &quot;pushed around&quot; (requiring constant harmonic reorientation) by 12et<br/>Messiaen<br/>&gt; more strongly than any other music I know of.  So to me 12et has<br/>plenty of<br/>&gt; ambiguity that in Messiaen&apos;s hands allows for rich contextual<br/>harmonic<br/>&gt; expression.  I don&apos;t know how this relates to the use of octatonic,<br/>nor have<br/>&gt; I looked into non-12et interpretations of octatonic.  The 4<br/>repetitions<br/>&gt; within the octave seems to allow a break from some too-standard<br/>ways of<br/>&gt; riding the circle of fifths, and yet (to me) capitalizes on the<br/>&gt; relationships it is breaking from.</p><p>***I agree with you here, Kurt!  The harmonic relationships in<br/>Messiaen are really stretching at 12-tET.  I&apos;m not certain how much<br/>he studied tuning, but the resonances surely make as much use of the<br/>harmonic series as 12-equal has to offer!  And he would go for more,<br/>if he could!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i&apos;ve already touched on a lot of these points earlier<br/>&gt; &gt; in this post.  my position:  there are very few<br/>&gt; &gt; orchestras which display a really fine and subtle<br/>&gt; &gt; sense of intonation as a whole.

Hogwood and J.Schroder the<br/>early symphonies where played with harpsichord continuo but not the<br/>later ones. As far as I remember, in the notes, it is stated that this<br/>choice corresponds to and historical change in practices. It was also<br/>alleged that that the later symphonies where sufficiently &quot;fleshed<br/>out&quot; to not necessitate keyboard continuo. But from from Monz&apos;s<br/>comment</p><p>&gt; the choice of pitches/tuning was already made by Mozart<br/>&gt; in his choice of notation. 55edo has an established<br/>&gt; (i.e., &quot;premeditated calculation&quot;) tuning and he chose<br/>&gt; particular notes from it in writing his pieces. in<br/>&gt; the first movement of his 40th Symphony, he uses 19<br/>&gt; different pitches (based on the assumption that sharps<br/>&gt; are different from their &quot;enharmonically-equivalent&quot; flats).<br/>&gt; and it&apos;s fascinating to see how he limits his set of<br/>&gt; pitches for certain sections of the music, then expands<br/>&gt; the set at other places by adding new flats, etc.</p><p>it seems that there is more than that. The use of fixed tuned continuo<br/>instrument in early symphonies precludes the enharmonic distinction (I<br/>think that splitted black keys where beginning to be uncommon by<br/>Mozart time??). So it seems that removing the harpsichord was<br/>necessary to give room to extra intonation sophistication of later<br/>symphonies.</p><p>So we may suppose that the symphonic genre moved from a keyboard<br/>driven intonation to string driven intonation by the time of mozart:<br/>the just tuning of string quartet instrument become the most important<br/>intonation constraint (if the idea that sympathetic vibration of open<br/>strings is correct). I do not remember at which time/symphony number<br/>the harpsichord continuo has ceased to be used, but Monz&apos;s comment<br/>suggest that it was a great paradigm shift in orchestra intonation.</p><p>I am wondering if at the time Haydn composed his &quot;sturm und drang&quot;<br/>symphonies (experimental music for the time) he intended performance<br/>with keyboard continuo.

The quick decay of the<br/>&gt;  harpsichord, especially when used for &apos;comping, the timbral and<br/>&gt;  rhythmic differences, mean that interference is minimal, esp. for<br/>&gt;  fast tunes and larger orchestras.

Of course, maybe that&apos;s<br/>&gt; just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because they are trying to master Werckmeister today, and it<br/>&gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different back in Mozart&apos;s time, but I doubt it...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; J.

Do you have a particular post in<br/>&gt; mind??<br/>&gt; &gt; (Not to make you &quot;hunt and peck...&quot;)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JP<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; basically, the idea of string players going out of their way to<br/>&gt; listen to the intonation of the fixed-pitch continuo makes some<br/>&gt; sense, but ibo and others, speaking from first-hand experience,<br/>know<br/>&gt; that in each particular harmonic verticality, many, if not most,<br/>&gt; skilled string players (at least those sensitive to any tuning<br/>&gt; aesthetic other than modern strict 12-equal) will be far more<br/>liable<br/>&gt; to lock into adaptive harmonies with one another than to respect<br/>the<br/>&gt; scale of the harpsichord to the extent of playing significantly<br/>&gt; tempered intervals even when they may not be present at that moment<br/>&gt; in time. obviously it&apos;s an aesthetic choice the director must make<br/>&gt; whether to encourage or work against these tendencies, and i&apos;m not<br/>&gt; claiming one approach is more valid than the other. but from<br/>personal<br/>&gt; experience, i know that when it comes to singing at least, the<br/>&gt; gravitational pull of vertical just sonorities with the other<br/>singers<br/>&gt; far overwhelms the tempering that a few individual, rapidly<br/>decaying<br/>&gt; steel strings may imply. recall that the ear hears a harmonic<br/>series<br/>&gt; as a single musical entity, integrated and without separable parts -<br/>-<br/>&gt; when a group of singers produces a vertically just harmony, the<br/>&gt; impression is of a single, marvellous vocal sound being produced,<br/>and<br/>&gt; the seduction of listener and singer alike that results is simply<br/>&gt; overwhelming (in my experience).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you said &quot;the practice of ensemble playing&quot;. there is more than one<br/>&gt; ensemble in existence!</p><p>***Yes, certainly this makes sense, Paul and I&apos;m sure it happens.<br/>Although, don&apos;t people say sometimes that strings play in<br/>Pythagorean??  That&apos;s a *type* of just, yes, but the thirds would be<br/>quite a bit larger than the integrated just ones, no??</p><p>And, in the case of the Werckmeister, the players were specifically<br/>instructed to listen to the fixed-pitch harpsichord to get the tuning<br/>right... at least this was my impression, unless Johnny informs us<br/>otherwise...</p><p>J.

I will not be referring to any theory at all (except the &quot;raw&quot;<br/>language of just intervals), and I will be going by exactly what I &quot;hear&quot;.<br/>There is no science in that at all, and I won&apos;t claim any in the result.  My<br/>specific &quot;hearing&quot; of the music may well be somebody else&apos;s &quot;any which way&quot;,<br/>but I don&apos;t think that was what Paul really meant.  Rather he recognizes<br/>that only restrictions imposed on what I do will be those I impose by my on<br/>&quot;choice&quot;, which makes it in a way less restrictive.  As much as possible for<br/>me I hope this will actually be a &quot;no choice&quot; scenario.</p><p>Of course, I may discover that there are ambiguities, or that I find it<br/>harder to hear so clearly when I become explicitly accountable for<br/>identifying every detail.  But is kind of normal for music to a musician -<br/>we have to learn how to get our minds out of the way, and we are more or<br/>less successful.</p><p>A good reason for having a good user-interface in place _before_ beginning<br/>such a task is to reduce the mental distraction level in the transcription<br/>process.</p><p>I will not try for any ultimate truth, but rather what I am clearly hearing<br/>in the moment.  My &quot;ear&quot; has a strong tendency to put in fundamental<br/>(implied bass line) notes in many things I hear, and I will not be concerned<br/>about any theory supporting a particular choice of &quot;fundamental&quot;, and indeed<br/>&quot;fundamental&quot; may turn out to be inaccurate - I will be curious to finally<br/>write down that implied bass note and find out what it _really_ is.  I will<br/>simply record what I hear, asking myself questions and re-listening as<br/>needed to clarify the ambiguities as they come up.  It might not always (or<br/>ever) be an implied fundamental that turns out to be the best &quot;anchor&quot; for<br/>the movement of the piece.  It might turn out to rest more in the melodic<br/>line, which also tends to have a very compelling presence.  Either way it<br/>will be good to have a tool that lets me define these anchors freely.  My<br/>guess is that a tool constructed this way _will_ have some very general<br/>utility, that people _will_ want to try this entirely unrestricted approach.<br/>I believe there is no problem in defining the interface in a fully general<br/>way for the most broadly conceived notion of this kind of task.</p><p>I won&apos;t be surprised if there are re-tune motions on held notes, but there<br/>might not be.  I _will_ be surprised if there is a net beginning-to-end<br/>retune motion, because I suspect the composer would have tried to avoid such<br/>an &quot;implication&quot;, and was probably not relying on being unconciously bound<br/>to a fixed 12et to keep it from happening.  However, I will be curious just<br/>to find out what comes.</p><p>Probably enough said, until I actually do it, _except_ to the degree that<br/>there is interest out there in defining a user-interface for this, or an<br/>underlying data mode.  However, I have to teach myself scala before I get<br/>too carried away.</p><p>Thanks to everyone for their support, and please chime in with your related<br/>interests.  If there is a lot of interest, I am more likely to do more work<br/>on creating a new tool, to be sure something that can work together with<br/>scala, or maybe even become part of it, if it turns out that way.</p><p>-Kurt Bigler</p></div><h3><a id=44896 href="#44896">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/20/2003 3:32:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;***From my experience on this list, I&apos;ve gathered, Kurt, that this<br/>&gt;entire &quot;adaptive tuning&quot; issue is a *huge* undertaking.

That&apos;s what a good<br/>user-interface avoids.</p><p>Here&apos;s a real basic interface definition, one simple action that allows for<br/>almost everything.  You have a score interface and an interval tool that<br/>enables a particular set of clicking/dragging capabilities.  You click and<br/>drag from any note to any other note in the score, vertically related, or<br/>horizontal forward or back - totally arbitrary, and then you specify by<br/>typing a ratio or selecting a ratio from a list what ratio you want to<br/>assign to the interval between those notes.  Let&apos;s say the ratio would<br/>always be the ratio of the drag destination over the drag source.  You<br/>continue dragging out ratios until the whole piece is fully specified, at<br/>which point the software could tell you you are done.  If you specify an<br/>interval that is out of the range of what would be likely given the local<br/>relationship established by the staff, you get a warning that you probably<br/>made a mistake.  Then in order to produce MIDI you need to specify a fixed<br/>note that will establish the absolute pitch (whereas everything else is<br/>relative).</p><p>This doesn&apos;t actually allow for an implied fundamental being recognized<br/>explicitly, but that can be dealt with if it is useful.  You don&apos;t really<br/>need the implied fundamental to be explicit to specify the intervals - you<br/>just have to do a quick division in your head and enter the result on the<br/>score.  But if the score editor let you add another note you could put in<br/>another note for it, and mark it &quot;silent&quot;.</p><p>The score might have a mode which shows the inter-note relationships in a<br/>visual form, as lines dragged between notes, hopefully in some distinctive<br/>color.  Then you can click on a note or on a line, and have all the info you<br/>entered show up somewhere.</p><p>I suspect someone has already done this, i.e. created a language that can<br/>specify relative pitch information in this way.  I have never used any of<br/>those programs that came out of IRCAM and CCRMA etc.  But it is probably<br/>less likely that anyone has solved this problem in a score-editing context<br/>that allows a midi file for input.

I am assuming for<br/>the sake of simplicity that it will be a good start, and perhaps sufficient,<br/>to have the ability to specify ratios between the fundamentals of the notes<br/>actually already present in the score, and that the &quot;user&quot; can fill in the<br/>rest of the process, using scraps of paper if necessary to do calculations.<br/>It might be useful to be able to express ratios of ratios directly in the<br/>annotation, to avoid having to do numeric calculations when you really just<br/>want to enter data.  In this particular case, I don&apos;t think this process<br/>depends much on the harmonics present in the rendering instrument.  Many<br/>different harmonic structures recreate basically &quot;the same Messiaen&quot;, as I<br/>hear it.  (But I can&apos;t stand it when the string players can&apos;t restrain their<br/>vibrato.

Perhaps the<br/>truth of this will turn out to be a function of the composer.

I keep speaking mostly from my<br/>experience, where my education provides mainly just the terminology.</p><p>&gt; but W. A. Mathieu, in his book &quot;Harmonic<br/>&gt; Experience&quot;, occasionally analyzes whether the gap between two<br/>&gt; different JI tones implied by the same ET tone is crossed directly, or<br/>&gt; over a period of ambiguouty.  Also, (and this is very pertinent to<br/>&gt; Messian) he analyzes how JI harmony in one tonality slides into<br/>&gt; symmetrical harmony, which, in some sense, implies ET, where all<br/>&gt; intervals are the same, and slides out again into a different JI<br/>&gt; tonality.</p><p>Yes, the question will be whether there is some &quot;force&quot; in the music which<br/>persists through what might be called an ambiguity, even if that is just the<br/>memory of a previous tonality.  The gluing together of the different<br/>tonalities may be somewhat arbitrary in relation to certain kinds of<br/>analysis, but might also end up being fairly specific from a listening<br/>experience point of view.  (Yet I hear that Mathieu is interested in the<br/>experience.)  That&apos;s what I want to find out.  The presence of the ET tones<br/>obviously can not be excluded as a normalizing &quot;force&quot; in the piece, and in<br/>organ music (which is what I am mainly considering, for the moment) the ET<br/>tones are all that is _really_ there.  I wonder if Mathieu looked into<br/>octatonic.</p><p>&gt; So, for example, you could have in measure 1 a unequivocal 25:16<br/>&gt; interval from a particular tone, that slides into whole tone scale<br/>&gt; unequivocally 2^(8/12) interval above that tone in measure 2, and in<br/>&gt; measure 3, resolves into 45/32 above 2^(2/12) interval above that tone.<br/>&gt; In other words, if the tone is C, a JI G# moving to an ET G#, moving<br/>&gt; to an G# that is a JI aug. 4th above an ET D (relative to C).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And the energy between these tones can be dissipated over an entire<br/>&gt; measure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, this sort of analysis seems useful for Messiaen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Louis</p><p>Yes, I was wondering whether _something_ like this might be a possibility.<br/>Messiaen has a _lot_ of rests too, some fairly long.  It seems very possible<br/>the specific intervals I am hearing may turn out to be fairly localized.<br/>But I don&apos;t want to jump the gun by making any assumptions yet.

(Of course I realize there is a distinction<br/>between noticing the tendency to drift and being able to respond skillfully<br/>to avoid it.)  Since I didn&apos;t actually know what the &quot;ways&quot; were that you<br/>were referring to, I made the assumption that you were referring to<br/>mechanical techniques for chosing between alternate just intervals in such a<br/>way that net drift would be avoided, i.e. algorithmically.  I assumed you<br/>felt that there was no inherent process guiding the composer to avoid drift,<br/>that such that a mechanical technique (or set of guidelines) must be used<br/>instead.  To me, it would seem that no such techniques would be necessary,<br/>because unmanifest drift-tendency would be noticed and corrected (or in fact<br/>never generated) by the composer, not just as an issue of &quot;spelling&quot; but as<br/>a natural response to the forces within the composition, including stability<br/>of pitch references which are part of the inherent meaning of a piece.<br/>Furthermore I tend to assume that when we hear harmony we hear with<br/>reference to exact ratio intervals at all times, and what deviates from that<br/>is not harmony per se, but either a system imosed upon or an intended<br/>tension applied to an underlying harmony.  I am trying to clarify in spite<br/>of possibly not having exact terminology usage, so please try to help by not<br/>reading me too literally.  This seems to be somehow a sublte point.  Is it<br/>coming through at all, such that you understand the apparent literal<br/>contradiction that arose?  Maybe this will clarify it:  You mention that<br/>John&apos;s program eliminates the drift.  I am saying why do you need a program<br/>to eliminate the drift?  What is so artificial that the program does that a<br/>composer would not naturally do it in response to the need for pitch<br/>stability, which will probably always be a force in music, unless we start<br/>composing while drifting in outer space, having lost all sense of ground?</p><p>As regards Mozart, and a &quot;strict JI&quot;, I am assuming that a &quot;strict JI&quot; is<br/>either not what I&apos;m interested in, or that the same problem might not occur<br/>with Messiaen.  Perhaps I will be working with a higher limit JI than you<br/>normally deal with, or perhaps that will not be satisfactory.</p><p>&gt;&gt; The hypothetical composer, hearing internally in JI would<br/>&gt;&gt; use techniques such as you describe below (springs, etc.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; they would? then there&apos;d be no preference for just intervals between<br/>&gt; the fundamentals, if the latter are even defined at all.</p><p>I made a bad guess at what you meant then.  I was assuming that John&apos;s<br/>program would do something that a composer could do, not something too<br/>clever or tricky.  Are you saying that John&apos;s program is not trying to put<br/>the fundamentals in exact ratios, but only keep the majority of harmonics<br/>from doing something nasty, like creating too much beating, possibly at the<br/>expense of the fundamentals?  In my experience, simple ratios between<br/>fundamentals (even in 12-tone) mean all the harmonics will blend more<br/>smoothly.  Why would you not prefer just intervals between the fundamentals?<br/>(I assume we are not talking about implied fundamentals here, but actual<br/>fundamentals of the notes in the piece.)</p><p>&gt;&gt; or others as part of<br/>&gt;&gt; the essential process of composing in JI (or hearing in JI while<br/>&gt;&gt; composing in 12-et).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; then it&apos;s not JI at all, it&apos;s adaptive tuning.</p><p>Not if the composer can compel the listener to hear the JI that he was<br/>hearing.  I&apos;m not assuming this, I&apos;m was just proposing it as a possibility<br/>of a skill that might exist.  I am not interested in it&apos;s likelihood.<br/>Developed skills are never likely in the surrounding cultural context.  The<br/>most important, compelling, and atractive developments are the ones that are<br/>indeed very unlikely to develop.  It might be an extreme form of musical<br/>empathy, you might say.  To care so much about what is heard that one<br/>listens to what will be heard while wanting to express something else.  The<br/>tension between the two creates the pressure to develop the skills to create<br/>the situation in which what is heard has a better relation to what is<br/>intended.  The extreme case of this development is perceived as nearly<br/>magical, and is deeply rooted in a very vast unconcious which depends on the<br/>collective relationship.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I am posing a hypothetical JI composer here.  I am<br/>&gt;&gt; supposing that any composer might hear in JI even while realizing<br/>&gt;&gt; the restrictions and tensions that will result from the piece being<br/>&gt;&gt; realized (and in fact &quot;composed&quot;) in 12-et.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it what sense is this &quot;hearing in JI&quot;? perhaps there&apos;s a different<br/>&gt; terminology we could come up with for what this is . . .</p><p>This refers to my assumption that harmony is always heard in reference to<br/>exact ratios.  This is a different &quot;value&quot; from the desire to avoid clashes<br/>among the harmonics of simultaneously-played notes.  So you might relate it<br/>more to the melodic domain even though vertical structure is involved.  I am<br/>assuming (again, as a hypothesis only) that there is a tendency to hear<br/>intervals as rational, that there is ambiguity there (e.g. caused by use of<br/>12et), and that a skillful composer can &quot;direct&quot; that ambiguity<br/>contextually, and that the direction can be done in such a way as to make<br/>the listener to the very intervals that John&apos;s program might have created,<br/>for example, guided by the composers innate sense of pitch stability in the<br/>face of all the other forces in the piece.  Perhaps Mozart did not develop<br/>in that direction.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Given a choice between two alternative<br/>&gt;&gt; paths in a composition, certain composers might naturally avoid the<br/>&gt;&gt; ones that do not express the intended implications well in 12-et.  My<br/>&gt;&gt; hunch is that in fact Messiaen was able to do this, and might have been<br/>&gt;&gt; fairly unique<br/>&gt;&gt; in this ability.  I also wonder how the choice of octatonic might<br/>&gt;&gt; support such a mode of composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes, this is the kind of thinking i was alluding to earlier . . . look<br/>&gt; again at the nice temperament graph:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.sonic-arts.org/dict/eqtemp.htm">http://www.sonic-arts.org/dict/eqtemp.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the meantone line is the subset of regular 5-limit tuning space in<br/>&gt; which renaissance and early common-practice (pre-beethoven,<br/>&gt; pre-schubert) music doesn&apos;t drift or experience other comma problems.<br/>&gt; it comes closest to the JI center between 31-equal and 19-equal.<br/>&gt; 12-equal is way off to the side!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; meanwhile, the diminished line is the subset of regular 5-limit tuning<br/>&gt; space in which progressions of triads in a single octatonic scale<br/>&gt; don&apos;t drift, etc. 12-equal is quite close to optimal!</p><p>Aha!  There&apos;s the meat.  But it will be a little while before I can really<br/>assimilate what is shown in those graphs.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because I suspect the composer would have tried to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; avoid such an &quot;implication&quot;,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ??<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Having heard the piece internally in JI, the composer recognizes<br/>&gt; that 12-et<br/>&gt;&gt; can only &quot;imply&quot; the JI, and a skillful composer might avoid<br/>&gt; compositional<br/>&gt;&gt; paths whose 12-et realizations would imply a JI &quot;truth&quot; that has<br/>&gt; &quot;drift&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; well, it&apos;s easy to quantify this for music with reasonably transparent<br/>&gt; chords, and in fact it&apos;s quite rare to find any such major composition<br/>&gt; much more recent than 1480 that would satisfy this &quot;avoidance&quot;. it&apos;s<br/>&gt; what mathieu terms &quot;zero-comma music&quot;. i&apos;m not sure if messaien&apos;s<br/>&gt; chords tend to be quite &quot;transparent&quot; enough -- meaning easily<br/>&gt; quantifiable in terms of a single fundamental. arguably, even the<br/>&gt; meager minor triad may vacillate between 10:12:15 and 16:19:24<br/>&gt; interpretations.</p><p>Ah.

I<br/>wonder whether I should remain a virgin of theory until after I attempt my<br/>Messien retuning.</p><p>But steping back again:  whatever theory you may refer to that makes it so<br/>easy to quantify things as you describe - are you so sure there are no<br/>expressive forces available to the composer that can counter these<br/>tendencies?  You are talking only in terms of scales and tunings, and not in<br/>terms of content.  There is this confusing thing about language.  You have<br/>something to say - that is the whole.  You have to fit that to a language.<br/>This is a trial and error interactive process - a dialog.  This does not<br/>apply to technical communication in a closed domain.  It applies to<br/>communication about what is not contained within &quot;the system&quot;.  To the<br/>person using language in this way, the language is not a system anyway - it<br/>is being experienced by the speaker in relation to what is beyond the<br/>language itself.</p><p>I know you can&apos;t change the cold hard facts of what intervals are available<br/>in a low limit system.  But perhaps the listener can be coerced into a<br/>higher-limit system as needed, with enough skill in the use of contextual<br/>information?  I am trying to provide an existence-proof here, i.e. not<br/>trying to prove the point, but trying to demonstrate that there may be a<br/>point there.</p><p>&gt;&gt; A skillful listener might recognize this.  Any listener might be<br/>&gt;&gt; influenced by it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; might be. mathieu exaggerates the extent to which this is so, however.</p><p>Its not possible to judge such a statement.  We are talking about life here,<br/>not a system.  How can one exaggerates or diminish what is unquantifiable?</p><p>&gt;&gt; This is an analysis/resynthesis game.  You do the analysis with the<br/>&gt;&gt; resynthesis in mind and minimize errors.  Just like audio<br/>&gt;&gt; compression, in a<br/>&gt;&gt; sense.  Transmitting true (JI) music over a limited bandwidth<br/>&gt;&gt; (12-et) medium.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; do you know of any examples of such true JI music, actually in JI?</p><p>No.  (My example was too technical anyway.)  I am contening that all music<br/>refers to JI, at the core.  I am saying that one aspect of the experience of<br/>music refers to these intervals.  And there are other aspects, and tensions<br/>between the aspects.  I am talking about what a person can be made to hear,<br/>i.e. inner experience, drawing from a domain that is for all practical<br/>purposes infinite, from which finite fractions can be brought to the<br/>foreground.  What comes to the foreground will not be consistent or<br/>resolvable.  It is a limited projection of a space of much higher<br/>dimensionality.  Have you ever tried to express something artfully?  You<br/>know in that case that you are going beyond the limits of the language at<br/>hand.  You create a kind of contradiction.  You are trying to say something<br/>that can&apos;t be heard.  The contradiction is a necessary aspect, part of the<br/>disarming that you are trying to achieve.  The limits are not just in the<br/>language, but in the culture, and in the one(s) you are trying to reach, and<br/>in yourself.  Yet you try to give voice to what is beyond those limitations,<br/>and the mere fact of honestly engaging such a process breaks one&apos;s own<br/>system limits so that communication to another becomes possible.  How?  Not<br/>according to theory.</p><p>Perhaps some of this is technically off-topic, but I trust the reactions<br/>won&apos;t be too severe.</p><p>-Kurt</p></div><h3><a id=44927 href="#44927">ðŸ”—</a>Kurt Bigler &#x3C;kkb@breathsense.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2003 2:17:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 6/21/03 12:07 AM, wallyesterpaulrus &lt;<a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; on 6/20/03 9:07 PM, wallyesterpaulrus &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his ideal of identifying the fundamental of every chord will<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; already run into huge problems in messaien,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; determining the fundamental messaien heard, or that anyone would<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; hear, or determining whether messaien heard these chords as<br/>&gt; having<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; single fundamental, given the kinds of chords he used, would run<br/>&gt; into<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; huge problems.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Go low enough and you&apos;ll find it though - if it was there in the<br/>&gt; first place<br/>&gt;&gt; (i.e. in the composer&apos;s conscious or unconscious experience).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; what do you mean, &quot;go low enough and you&apos;ll find it&quot;? unambiguously?</p><p>No, I was just being sloppy there.

You reduce or eliminate the brain&apos;s ability to determine<br/>tonality by going symmetrical or pantonal.  ET is the optimal symmetric<br/>or pan-tonal scale par excellance, because it has maximum ambiguouty<br/>(sp?) between tonalities.  So, I understand him to be saying that the<br/>only two interesting tunings from the standpoint of the deep perceptual<br/>processes of the brain are JI and ET, though there are lots of possible<br/>choices in actual performance on the spectrum between these.  It&apos;s sort<br/>of like saying that the brain only processes three colors, red, blue,<br/>and green, although obviously the color pallete achievable from mixing<br/>these three is enourmous.</p><p>&gt;&gt;i&apos;m not sure how you would project both an &quot;unequivocal 25:16&quot; and an<br/>&gt;&quot;unequivocally 2^(8/12) interval&quot; unless you are speaking literally of<br/>&gt;the exact tuning used in some sort of polymicrotonal composition. can<br/>&gt;you explain?</p><p>By unequivocal, I mean there only being one interpretation of the tone<br/>in the deep perceptual structures of the brain.  For example, if I play<br/>a C and an E on the piano, nice and slow, the brain thinks it&apos;s hearing<br/>a (slightly out of tune) 5:4 third.  On the other hand if I play a C<br/>major triad and then a G7 chord, and play a symmetrical diminished<br/>scale over that features a Ab/G#, the brain cannot resolve whether that<br/>note is the 16:15 of G or the 45:32 of D without context--is it the<br/>Phrygian of G or the Lydian of the secondary dominant of G? So that<br/>note does not have an unambigous JI interpretation.

The gluing together of the different<br/>&gt;tonalities may be somewhat arbitrary in relation to certain kinds of<br/>&gt;analysis, but might also end up being fairly specific from a listening<br/>&gt;experience point of view.</p><p>Mathieu pretty much details the experience like this, in my<br/>understanding:  The amount of tension-release when a ET tone changes<br/>its JI implication is pretty much proportional to three factors:<br/>1) how many primes the comma had to cross--for example, a didymic comma<br/>(difference between four fifths up and a third up)  is crossing one<br/>third, the diaschisma (difference between a bunch of fifth up and two<br/>thirds up) crossing two thirds, and the great deisis (difference<br/>between three thirds and an octave) crossing three thirds.  Crossing<br/>more primes yields greater affect.<br/>2) how low the exponents are between the primes made equivalent--for<br/>example, the didymic comma, is more affective than the diaschisma,<br/>because the didymic comma is the &quot;equivalence&quot; between one third and<br/>four fifths, as opposed to two thirds and _a lot_ of fifths.<br/>3) how low the prime factor is--crossing a 81:80 comma (involving 3:5<br/>ratios) yields a more obvous affect than crossing a 49:48 (involving<br/>7:3) ratios<br/>4) how quickly the tone moves across the comma--if the underlying<br/>harmony modulates the implication of the tone slowly, then the<br/>affective energy is experienced gradually.  In a sudden shift, the<br/>affective energy is experienced all at once.</p><p>So, to summarize, if a note that can be expressed as the JI ratio 3^x *<br/>5^y * 7^z... modulates to another JI ratio 3^m * 5^n * 7^o</p><p>1) the affective impact is greater if the absolute value of Y-N, and<br/>Z-O are larger.<br/>2) the affective impact is greater if y, z, n, and o are lower<br/>3) the affective impact is more impacted by Y and M than Z and O<br/>4) the affective energy is spread out over the amount of time the<br/>modulation extends over.</p><p>It would be interesting to make a graph of affective space, because the<br/>above surely is some sort of non-linear equation.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve expressed this clearly, but if this is of interest,<br/>please ask a question!</p><p>Louis</p></div><h3><a id=44943 href="#44943">ðŸ”—</a>Louis_Nelson@adidam.org</h3><span>6/21/2003 10:28:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;***Hello Louis!</p><p>&gt;This seems a little bit like what I was describing of maybe using 12-<br/>&gt;tET as an &quot;adaptive&quot; underlying horizontal organizer for moments that<br/>&gt;were retuned in just... ??</p><p>&gt;J.

Obviously, major thirds with many different intonations<br/>can all be recognized as major thirds.  So, it appears, that at one<br/>level, the brain is basically doing a prime factoring and concluding<br/>that its hearing a major third--and the simplest major third (lowest<br/>ratio) is a 5:4 major third.

Perhaps the composers were actually thinking in the<br/>temperaments in which they worked, and not in JI.  Of course there<br/>may be exceptions, but as a rule this one of the conclusions<br/>reached here (by like, four people or something -- quite impressive<br/>for this list! :), that temperaments are not &apos;less natural&apos; than<br/>JI.  Rather, **they follow naturally from JI.**</p><p>This doesn&apos;t mean that one can&apos;t perform classical music in JI,<br/>however!!  Messiaen has never been rendered in JI to my knowledge,<br/>so nobody knows what it will sound like!</p><p>&gt;I made the assumption that you were referring to mechanical techniques<br/>&gt;for chosing between alternate just intervals in such a way that net<br/>&gt;drift would be avoided, i.e. algorithmically.</p><p>Some of that.

Maybe this will clarify it:  You<br/>&gt;mention that John&apos;s program eliminates the drift.  I am saying why<br/>&gt;do you need a program to eliminate the drift?</p><p>Classical music was composed assuming that certain commas disappear,<br/>if you view notes on a staff as representing fixed, absolute<br/>pitches.

The fact is that nobody&apos;s ever done an experiment to see<br/>if really hurts anything, and if so, in which styles.</p><p>&gt;As regards Mozart, and a &quot;strict JI&quot;, I am assuming that a &quot;strict JI&quot;<br/>&gt;is either not what I&apos;m interested in, or that the same problem might<br/>&gt;not occur with Messiaen.</p><p>Nobody knows.

That doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t think at 2 (or more)<br/>levels.  The presence of &quot;thinking&quot; in JT at the same time may be what makes<br/>it interesting.

Perhaps the composers were actually thinking in the<br/>&gt; temperaments in which they worked, and not in JI.  Of course there<br/>&gt; may be exceptions, but as a rule this one of the conclusions<br/>&gt; reached here (by like, four people or something -- quite impressive<br/>&gt; for this list! :), that temperaments are not &apos;less natural&apos; than<br/>&gt; JI.  Rather, **they follow naturally from JI.**<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This doesn&apos;t mean that one can&apos;t perform classical music in JI,<br/>&gt; however!!  Messiaen has never been rendered in JI to my knowledge,<br/>&gt; so nobody knows what it will sound like!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I made the assumption that you were referring to mechanical techniques<br/>&gt;&gt; for chosing between alternate just intervals in such a way that net<br/>&gt;&gt; drift would be avoided, i.e. algorithmically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some of that.  Tempered intervals between roots are also allowed.<br/>&gt; And finally, very small amounts of (dynamically-calculated) tempering<br/>&gt; of simultaneous intervals is allowed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I preferred John&apos;s software without these &quot;improvements&quot;.

If you use JI, you wind up having to change this view of<br/>&gt; notes on a page.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, sometimes the pitch does drift (especially in amateur groups).<br/>&gt; However, in certain types of music, I suspect drift isn&apos;t so much of<br/>&gt; an issue.

You reduce or eliminate the brain&apos;s ability to determine<br/>&gt; tonality by going symmetrical or pantonal.  ET is the optimal<br/>symmetric<br/>&gt; or pan-tonal scale par excellance, because it has maximum<br/>ambiguouty<br/>&gt; (sp?) between tonalities.  So, I understand him to be saying that<br/>the<br/>&gt; only two interesting tunings from the standpoint of the deep<br/>perceptual<br/>&gt; processes of the brain are JI and ET, though there are lots of<br/>possible<br/>&gt; choices in actual performance on the spectrum between these.

For example, if I<br/>play<br/>&gt; a C and an E on the piano, nice and slow, the brain thinks it&apos;s<br/>hearing<br/>&gt; a (slightly out of tune) 5:4 third.  On the other hand if I play a C<br/>&gt; major triad and then a G7 chord, and play a symmetrical diminished<br/>&gt; scale over that features a Ab/G#, the brain cannot resolve whether<br/>that<br/>&gt; note is the 16:15 of G or the 45:32 of D without context--is it the<br/>&gt; Phrygian of G or the Lydian of the secondary dominant of G? So that<br/>&gt; note does not have an unambigous JI interpretation.

What do you<br/>hear (or believe is heard) when the ear hears the D in, for example, a<br/>Cmajor-Gmajor-Cmajor chord standing alone played in meantone?  At a<br/>deep level, is it hearing it as an out of tune 9:8, because it is<br/>supported by fifth-type motion?  Or is the tone heard as ambigous<br/>between the two D&apos;s?

Numbers are definitely a force in the<br/>&quot;unconscious&quot;.  I think this is so deep that I never even considered trying<br/>to approach this consciously as it might relate to pitch and interval<br/>sensibilities, and I don&apos;t know how it relates to the &quot;forces&quot; that I feel.<br/>I think the forces that I feel are somehow very related to the body, to what<br/>I experience as the space inside the body and how it by being present here<br/>the space inside me is resonating with the things I am considering in a<br/>&quot;bodily&quot; way (not just in a cognitive way), which is how music has to be for<br/>me, though I usually don&apos;t talk too much about this.  Its not that I&apos;m not<br/>_extremely_ cognitive, but by and large the cognitive in spite of its<br/>complexity and vastness, is just a reflection of something even more vast<br/>and beyond understanding.  Even the body itself which is very &quot;finite&quot; is<br/>also rather infinite if looked at from the inside.  The capacities for<br/>assimilation of forms, &quot;resonances&quot;, bodily &quot;reflection&quot;, and various things<br/>which we consider &quot;cognitive&quot; have a lot of depth that goes beyond what we<br/>can understand consciously.  Little do we know what we are doing when we say<br/>we are &quot;thinking&quot; and many people mean something very different by the same<br/>word.</p><p>So as regards primes, I think the aspect of existence we call &quot;number&quot; goes<br/>very deep in experience.  I started to write a little about this, but it got<br/>way too long, and I&apos;m not sure of its relevance.  I feel like I&apos;ve already<br/>written enough longish things that tend to be off-topic-ish lately.  So I&apos;ll<br/>send it too you (monz) directly, off-list, and if anybody else wants an<br/>experiential reflection on &quot;number&quot; that is sort of half-baked, let me know.</p><p>But tell me:  what is the particular connection you are seeing that led you<br/>to respond?  I had mentioned &quot;forces&quot; and so forth, but I&apos;m not sure which<br/>thing you were picking up on.  I think maybe you are talking about the<br/>possible connection between the experience of reconciling different forces<br/>musically and some numerical linguistic level which somehow may underlying<br/>the experience of pitch relationships, that the &quot;forces&quot; are the force of an<br/>underlying language, perhaps an experirence of bumping into the &quot;structures&quot;<br/>inherent in that space of relationships.

What do<br/>you<br/>&gt; hear (or believe is heard) when the ear hears the D in, for<br/>example, a<br/>&gt; Cmajor-Gmajor-Cmajor chord standing alone played in meantone?  At a<br/>&gt; deep level, is it hearing it as an out of tune 9:8, because it is<br/>&gt; supported by fifth-type motion?  Or is the tone heard as ambigous<br/>&gt; between the two D&apos;s?  Or is this a silly question?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My feeling, is that if the D is heard in a Cmajor-Gmajor-Cmajor<br/>&gt; context, it evokes a 9:8 D, because a motion up in fifths is<br/>occuring.<br/>&gt; If it is heard in a Cmajor-Fmajor-Bbmajor context, it evokes a 10:9<br/>D,<br/>&gt; because a motion down in fifths is happening, and the D is a third<br/>up<br/>&gt; from a motion down in fifths.  If the context is<br/>&gt; Cmajor-Fmajor-Bbmajor-Gminor-Cmajor, then it is heard perceptually<br/>as<br/>&gt; crossing from a 10:9 to a 9:8 D.</p><p>hmm . . . to me it&apos;s a bit of a silly question, because while the<br/>ear/brain is clearly designed to interpret &quot;JI&quot; into what it hears in<br/>limited, localized circumstances, i think with these progressions<br/>you&apos;re already going outside that into the realm of cultural<br/>expression and creation (rather than natural, evolutionarily<br/>significant phenomena), and then discussing, at best, what the ear<br/>hears when it&apos;s already had significant experience with strict JI as<br/>a fully implemented musical tuning system. i&apos;ve had these arguments<br/>extensively on this list, with joe monzo usually taking the other<br/>side (mathieu&apos;s), and david finnamore and joseph pehrson often<br/>echoing my point of view. but we don&apos;t necessarily have to go there<br/>just yet, because i think there&apos;s a lot we could learn from one<br/>another before addressing such deep philosophical matters . . . to<br/>begin, perhaps we could just bring up the issue of meantone tuning in<br/>general -- it was simply known as &quot;correct tuning&quot; for three full<br/>centuries of our history, longer than 12-equal and far longer than<br/>any strict (non-adaptive) JI system could claim -- and whenever<br/>mathieu says &quot;equal temperament does such-and-such&quot; with respect to<br/>the 81:80 comma, he could, with more precision and far more<br/>historical relevance, be talking about meantone tuning instead . . .</p><p>&gt; He&apos;s somewhat but not very internet savvy.

The UI you (and others) propose leads to a state<br/>&gt; space so big that it&apos;s very unlikely an underlying API could have<br/>&gt; thought to support it without the UI already existing.</p><p>Keep in mind I&apos;m talking &quot;symbolic&quot; here, specifically &quot;text&quot;.  When I said<br/>&quot;technical score&quot; I meant a score that looks like LISP (for example).</p><p>When you are working in LISP you hardly think so much of API.  Instead you<br/>can think how you want to express things.  I&apos;m saying these languaes already<br/>had the ability to specify instrument, pitch, time, and duration, and it is<br/>easy to write a wrapper around that to specify the pitches via a score-wide<br/>directed graph.  The actual development needed to implement computation of<br/>pitches for this is trivial, and the &quot;underlying API&quot; already had the rest.<br/>The language provides for arbitrarily extensible hierarchical symbolic<br/>notation.  Rule-based is still another thing, but that has been done in LISP<br/>too.  Mind you I&apos;m not suggesting this is the way to go (read on), but just<br/>to clarify the domain of possibilities.  It is good if everybody has a<br/>broader perspective on what is possible in computing, since the mainstream<br/>has dropped all the major developments, and even the _meanings_ of the<br/>alternatives have never entered the broader community.  [OT:  Else we would<br/>never have anything like Windows.  Of course web-enabled LISP would be a big<br/>security problem.  All your attachments would have executed before you knew<br/>what happenned, creating large just-intonation compositions automatically<br/>that reflect your use of the web, and spreading into all your 12et<br/>compositions, gradually transforming them, and inserting them into your<br/>website, while you are busy browsing.]</p><p>You are much better off for these purposes in a interpretive language where<br/>the code&apos;s internal representation is a direct parallel of the surface<br/>syntax, and in which it is trivial for a running program to extend itself<br/>because the code is just data that can be readily constructed.  Then your<br/>score becomes simply a program, but also remains raw data.  When the form of<br/>the data is simple (usually meaning a tree) then it is easy to edit it using<br/>various tools that are easy to create.</p><p>My second point (in the original message) was that these things probably do<br/>not exist in a context that is relational with a &quot;traditional&quot; score editor.</p><p>This makes me think that one of the things this community might wish for is<br/>a fully extensible score editor.  Not just open-source but also with<br/>message-based plug-ins, so that the UI can support translation of user<br/>actions for a plug-in &quot;tool&quot; in to arbitrary creation of data that was never<br/>pre-conceived, and which any &apos;ol programmer can add at any time, by writing<br/>a new plug-in that presents say a tool icon for itself, and code to handle<br/>standard mouse actions on a score.  Tools for a creative community need to<br/>be readily extensible.  Creating a tool that isn&apos;t extensible may be all<br/>some have the time for, but given the choice, it is kind of a disservice to<br/>create a non-extensible tool.  The tools should be changing as quick as the<br/>messages fly in this list.</p><p>&gt; It would be<br/>&gt; as if the current Windows API was included in DOS, but just not<br/>&gt; exposed to the user.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Like there have been lisp-based symbolic languages used for &quot;score&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; notation, in the most technical sense of &quot;score&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why do they have to be symbolic?  Why doesn&apos;t ANSI C qualify as an<br/>&gt; extensible language that supports JI score entry?</p><p>Well, ANSI C is &quot;symbolic&quot; of course, but it has a syntax that makes<br/>automatic editing of source impractical, and furthermore it is not<br/>interpreted.  Probably I answered this point above.</p><p>&gt;&gt; You can add to them anything you want for notation purposes, and<br/>&gt;&gt; easy enough bring the semantics alive for rendering.  Actually<br/>&gt;&gt; something rule-based would be desirable for this, so that the total<br/>&gt;&gt; pitch scene could be inferred from limited information, with<br/>&gt;&gt; reasonable default rules applied, such as staying in the source<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament for all unspecified horizontal relationships.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey, if you think you can see a way to do it, don&apos;t listen to me!<br/>&gt; I&apos;d give out my grandmother&apos;s secret applesauce recipe for such<br/>&gt; software!</p><p>Well, ok, now your cookin&apos;.  If I had nothing else to do it would be easy.<br/>Is there a way we can set it up so that some people can make a living?<br/>Don&apos;t all just rush over here with your funds now, the door is only so wide,<br/>and trips to the bank take time.  :)</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Please do.

It might be that there is a object-oriented plug-in<br/>extensible score editor for NEXTSTEP, written in Objective C.  Porting to OS<br/>X is not trivial though, because the low-level built in OOP facilities (Of<br/>the Objective-C variety have been ripped out for performance reasons.<br/>Objective C does not satisfy the code=data criterion, but it has everything<br/>else going for it that C++ does not have, featuest that are good for plug-in<br/>extensibility.

Would be easily<br/>adapted to parse them in midi input streams.</p><p>Mine isn&apos;t the most elegant possible way of doing it,<br/>in terms of the fewest possible lines of code to do the<br/>job (has 150 lines of code which is a fair amount for<br/>what it does), but it works and is well tested. Supports input<br/>of sysexes in all the MTS formats. It can also output<br/>it&apos;s parse of the sysex to a log file so you can<br/>see what it is doing, in fact that is what I<br/>use it for at present.</p><p>I can adapt it easily so it just is say, something like</p><p>char ReadMTSSysex<br/>(FILE *fp,BYTE bySysex,int ilen_Sysex<br/>,int iNotesToRetune[128],double dMidiNotes[128]<br/>,double dFrequencies[128],char *pCheckSumOk<br/>);<br/>which would then update dMidiNotes with the<br/>midi note values from the sysex in the decimal format<br/>of e.g. 60.5 for midi note 60 + 50 cents.</p><p>Would return 1 if bySysex is a correctly formatted MTS sysex,<br/>0 if not, and if pCheckSumOk is non null<br/>then sets that to 1 if the checksum is okay<br/>though normally one should just ignore the checksum<br/>as it is easy for a coder to get that wrong<br/>and it really isn&apos;t needed any more nowadays.</p><p>When fp is non null it would also make a log<br/>of the sysex values to it (mainly intended<br/>for debugging).</p><p>I can get that together in a few minutes for anyone<br/>who is interested. On request. I think it is surely by far<br/>the best standard format available for communicating<br/>tunings from one program to another.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
