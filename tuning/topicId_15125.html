Well,<br/>geometricians might but not because the musical structure gives them such clues. :-)  The point, it seems to me, is to reflect the<br/>beauty and symmetry of the shape by musical analogy, not to make the shape itself appear in the listener&apos;s imagination.</p><p>So what do other composers seek to accomplish with CPS structures?

However, the pair of intervals I mentioned above look completely<br/>different on your hexany diagram -- one is a direct connection between two adjacent<br/>notes, while the other relates two notes on opposite sides of the hexany.</p><p>&gt; The above don&apos;t sound the same unless you sound them in isolation from each other, outside the structure.  As you know, they produce<br/>&gt; the same interval but at different pitches.  Their relationship to each other is what I&apos;m seeing as lying on the face of the<br/>&gt; octahedron.

Seems to me I&apos;m not pushing the abstraction as far as he is.</p><p>In Erv&apos;s diagrams a given interval will normally appear in different places in the diagram<br/>with the same length and the same direction. That&apos;s what lattices are all about. In your<br/>hexany that&apos;s not happening.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The shape changes because of viewing it from a different angle.  If the A face looks like an equilateral triangle, the B face will not<br/>&gt; look equilateral from that same angle.  I&apos;m seeing the octahedron as made of lines, not planes, so I can see the B from its &quot;back side&quot;<br/>&gt; while looking at the A face on.  This is all completely relative.  Since a geometrical figure can be viewed from any angle, I don&apos;t see<br/>&gt; how _any_ direct, absolute relationship could ever be established between chord shapes and the sides of a figure in a CPS structure.</p><p>It can, and is. In the lattice (even yours), a triangle in a given orientation will always<br/>represent the same kind of chord, with the same intervals (octave-equivalence<br/>assumed).  The eight triangles in the hexany are all in different orientations (you can&apos;t<br/>make one coincide with another just by sliding), thus they should all be different kinds of<br/>chords. In the 1-3-5-7 hexany, they are: 1:3:5, 1:3:7, 1:5:7, 3:5:7, 1/(1:3:5), 1/(1:3:7), 1/(1:5:7),<br/>1/(3:5:7).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I had been composing simply in a hexatonic scale, I would have had many more triads and a bunch of tetrads and pentads at my<br/>&gt; disposal, not just the 8 triads of the hexany.  Also, I would have had far more melodic freedom.  But I don&apos;t see the point of a merely<br/>&gt; hexatonic Pythagorean scale.

It&apos;s an open circle.  They should form a cohesive set when placed on<br/>&gt; the 6 points of an octahedron, as far as I can see.  What am I missing?</p><p>David, you could make a 2)4 1-9-27-81 hexany using the exact same Pythagorean<br/>hexatonic scale -- the same six pitches. This would give you a different set of 8 triads and<br/>different melodic choices. However, if you &quot;modulated&quot; from one hexany to the other at<br/>various points in your piece, would they be perceived as modulations?</p><p>In your original hexany, consider the following chords:</p><p>a) (81*1):(9*3):(9*1)<br/>b) (1*9):(1*3):(3*9)<br/>c) (81*1):(1*3):(81*3)</p><p>Of these, (b) and (c) are triads you&apos;re allowing yourself to use, while (a) is not. However,<br/>(a) is more consonant than (c), and just as consonant as (b). Normally, the &quot;disallowed&quot;<br/>triads in the hexany should be at least as dissonant as the &quot;allowed&quot; ones. That&apos;s kind of<br/>the point of the hexany.</p><p>I would argue that you could map the six notes of the hexatonic scale to the octahedron<br/>any old way, disregarding products of factors, etc., and still end up with just as nice and<br/>logical a piece of music, because you&apos;re a talented composer.</p><p>&gt; Oh, I see I never answered one of your questions about &quot;complete triads.&quot;  As you may have guessed, I was making the mistake of looking<br/>&gt; at it from a diatonic perspective, counting only triads with a 1-3-5 (diatonic relative scale number) relationship as &quot;complete.&quot;  That<br/>&gt; appears to have nothing to do with CPS.</p><p>I don&apos;t even remember when that came up . . .

Kraig?<br/>&gt;Carl?</p><p>Actually, I&apos;ve never composed strictly within a CPS, at least not<br/>intentionally (other than a few demos which I&apos;ll post shortly).</p><p>One thing I&apos;m very interested in as a composer is leaving diatonicity and<br/>exploring a style where (often simple) melodies are derrived from non-<br/>diatonic common-tone modulations, and subject to heavy variation (with the<br/>interesting catch that the borders between variations are intentionally<br/>blurred -- but that&apos;s another topic for another list).  Inspired by late<br/>Beethovan, YES, and Jazz, and much 20th-century music, this is the<br/>direction I&apos;ve taken with 12-tET so far.  Anywho, I think CPSs are a great<br/>way to familiarize oneself with the common-tone progressions of a given<br/>limit, and I like the way their incomplete chords help thin out higher-<br/>limit utonal sonorities.  For these reasons, I plan on spending some<br/>quality time with the pentadekany and eikosany at some point.  Eventually,<br/>however, I&apos;d imagine I&apos;d work in free-JI (and perhaps even extend<br/>common-tone possibilities somewhat with temperament), but armed with my<br/>CPS experience.</p><p>Of course, I&apos;m also interested in new types of diatonicity (it&apos;s not<br/>diatonicity I&apos;m bored of... just 5-limit 7-tone diatonicity!) like Paul<br/>Erlich&apos;s decatonic scales in 22-tET, or Easley Blackwood&apos;s decatonic in<br/>15-tET (his 15-tone etude is one of my favorite microtonal tunes).  To that<br/>end, the hexany and dekany might prove to be good theoretical tools for<br/>locating &quot;generalized diatonic&quot; scales.</p><p>BTW, I like your hexany piece too!  And your contribution to the tape swap<br/>was way cool, as I&apos;ve said here before!</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
