Different &apos;maqam&apos; s were prescribed for different mental disorders<br/>for effective treatment. I was told by a reliable source about vast<br/>literature on the subject in Konya. The importance of music or sound<br/>therapy is just beginning to be re-discovered in modern medicine in Turkey<br/>and possibly elsewhere in the world.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Dr. Can Akkoc<br/>Alabama School of Mathematics and Science<br/>1255 Dauphin Street<br/>Mobile, AL 36604<br/>USA</p><p>Phone:  (334) 441-2126<br/>  Fax:  (334) 441-3290<br/>  Web:  <a href="http://199.20.31.100/GIFT/">http://199.20.31.100/GIFT/</a></p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/1999 11:17:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bill Alves point about kidney (and also gall) stones is right, but I<br/>believe that surgeons use  a sweeping frequency ultrasound oscillator to<br/>locate the specific resonant frequency of the stone. Again, there is no<br/>particular frequency which can be said to have a universal effect on well<br/>being, but rather a frequency band.</p><p>The Chinese example is attractive at first glance, but really collapses<br/>when one considers that the reference pitch has changed over the years and<br/>from region to region -- from the various yellow bell standards to the<br/>present 440 (and rising). So again, no single frequency can be identified.<br/>If, however, the wellness tone is thought of instead as denoting an<br/>_interval_ within the gamut, I would begin to find the idea more plausible.</p><p>Can Akkoc&apos;s note about the Selcuk Turks and the use of particular maqam to<br/>treat mental disorders is not an example of single tones, but of some<br/>intervallic system. Again, this is more plausible, but I would refer anyone<br/>interested to the ethnomusicologist Gilbert Rouget&apos;s masterful volume<br/>_Music and Trance_ for a very convincing argument against any material<br/>connection between the music used and the induction of trance.  Rouget&apos;s<br/>argument, with examples from world and historical musics is simply that the<br/>music serves a function in the entire trance complex but is not of itself<br/>instrumental in the trance.</p></div><h3>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/1999 7:49:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gentlefolks<br/>Barbara has been prescribing &quot;wellness intervals&quot; for twenty years<br/>Please visit  <a href="http://www.lambdoma.com">http://www.lambdoma.com</a></p><p>Bill Alves wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu">alves@orion.ac.hmc.edu</a> (Bill Alves)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
