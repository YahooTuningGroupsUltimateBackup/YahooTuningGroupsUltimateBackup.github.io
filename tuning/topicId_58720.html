I vote that scale retains its ordinary musical meaning, fuzzy though that may be. In particular, I think a scale is something we can hear, not a list of numbers, and not something written on a staff, although scales may of course be represented by either of these. I think we are unlikely to ever capture what makes a good scale, in a short description (mathematical or otherwise). However we do have useful mathematical descriptions of several properties that seem to be present in many traditional scales. -- Dave Keenan<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
