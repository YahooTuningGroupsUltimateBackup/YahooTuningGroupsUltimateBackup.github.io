In general, a meantone is constructed the same<br/>way as Pythagorean tuning, as a chain of perfect fifths, but in a<br/>meantone, each fifth is narrowed by the same amount (or<br/>equivalently, each fourth widened) in order to make the other<br/>intervals like the major third closer to their ideal just ratios.</p><p>&quot;Quarter-comma meantone is the most well known type of meantone<br/>temperament, and the term meantone temperament is often used to<br/>refer to it specifically.&quot;</p><p>I don&apos;t remember Gene&apos;s wikipedia handle, but I don&apos;t recognize<br/>it in the article&apos;s history, either.  I&apos;ve never seen this<br/>article before.  A lot of the tuning stuff on wikipedia is<br/>written by AugPi and Rainwarrior, who seem to be familiar with<br/>the tuning-math stuff, or have independently discovered it.<br/>(Rainwarrior is Brad Smith who may be subscribed.  I don&apos;t<br/>know if AugPi is, but I don&apos;t remember him having contributed.)</p><p>from the Tonalsoft Encyclopedia</p><p>&quot;A family of tuning-systems in which the two JI &quot;whole tones&quot;<br/>(with ratios of 9:8 and 10:9) are conflated into one &quot;mean<br/>tone&quot; which lies between the two, the objective being to produce<br/>or approximate JI &quot;major 3rd&quot;s (with a ratio of 5:4) but to<br/>eliminate the syntonic comma and its associated problem of<br/>commatic drift by having only one size of whole-tone.<br/>...<br/>&quot;Note that while ET versions of meantone create a closed<br/>(circular) system, the non-ET meantones (i.e., all of the<br/>fraction-of-a-comma meantones) do not. They instead form an<br/>open-ended chain.&quot;</p><p>So I don&apos;t see why anyone should be surprised at the claim<br/>that there&apos;s some consensus on the issue.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=73239 href="#73239">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2007 3:26:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t remember Gene&apos;s wikipedia handle, but I don&apos;t recognize<br/>&gt; it in the article&apos;s history, either.</p><p>My Wiki nym is kind of hard to remember: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot;.</p></div>
