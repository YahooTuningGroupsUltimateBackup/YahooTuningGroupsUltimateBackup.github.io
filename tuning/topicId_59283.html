If one traces the trajectory of his work, he set up a system<br/>that allowed for both extensive harmonic use of just intervals, but<br/>also gave a broad range of intervals, in a scalar manner, to create<br/>melodic lines that more closely linked with the human voice. The idea<br/>of &apos;Monophony&apos;, in his usage, very much points to it&apos;s literal<br/>translation; the one-approach meant a real focus on melodic intervals,<br/>and all of his early works, especially the Li Po poems, are<br/>melodically driven.</p><p>This is not to say that the particular system he utilized is unsuited<br/>to harmonic use, but that it isn&apos;t necessarily the primary use.

For those that look backwards at Partch&apos;s<br/>system of tuning as an artifact, and especially if they view their own<br/>world in a harmony-centric way, they might see it as you do.

Being a system that he<br/>developed in his own time for his own use, it became ingrained in his<br/>compositional and expressive nature. And if one, as I said before,<br/>looks at the entire output of how *he* used the system, one sees that<br/>a traditional harmonic engine was not his primary focus, though there<br/>were plenty of moments that explored those worlds of the tonality diamond.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=59297 href="#59297">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2005 10:25:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Actually Gene, i do think it is useful to know the harmonic material of a scale in potential as well as the near misses, which i often find quite musically exciting as points of tension ( an option to tempering them out)<br/>I was trying to say is that a scale is a balance of two different needs and a good one will have both. unless of course one&apos;s musical concerns are not interested in one over the other.  Not in the case of what you recently proposed, but in the past there has been examples of scales that were higher in more harmonic material than others, but produced less interesting melodic integrity.<br/>with equal this is never a problem, but with anything else , one would , for instance want to possibly be able to repeat your melodic size at the fourth or fifth or anywhere else one can in order to have different voices have an idea within their own range or octave equivalent. possibly anywhere in the middle might work for this purpose.</p><p>the diamond is a good example in that partch had his harmonic construct, but he did fill in the gaps to balance out his melodic needs. Novaro did the same with the 7 limit diamond</p><p>&#x9;As to if one can have a scale with with 19 tones hold together as a gestalt, i think the answer is yes, even though we supposedly get lost after 7-9 objects ( forget the exact number). With a scale we are dealing with a structure with its own cyclical properties that can be grasped in the sense that we can define a curve with say 9 dots that is much larger than we can even draw on a sheet a paper.<br/>While as time goes on , i tend to use smaller and smaller scales members, i do think i can grasp at least 22 without too much doubt.<br/>I don&apos;t think we completely understand the gestalt of sounds and pitch relationships like we do visual elements.
