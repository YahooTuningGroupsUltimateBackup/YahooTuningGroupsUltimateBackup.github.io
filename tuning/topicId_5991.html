Not many people do.  I suspect<br/>that, from their perspective, they would classify as approximating 12TET any<br/>tuning wherein the intervals of the scale are closer to an integer number of<br/>12ths of an octave than they are to the quartertones between them.  I rather<br/>doubt if they&apos;re more concerned with the question at a greater level of detail<br/>than that.</p></div><h3><a id=5997 href="#5997">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/1999 7:50:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gary Morrison wrote...</p><p>&gt;Admitting that I&apos;ve only read a short fragment of the website on this flute,<br/>&gt;and acknowledging that perhaps I&apos;m underestimating these archeologists, I&apos;ll<br/>&gt;say that I kinda doubt if they have the same perspective and detail on tuning<br/>&gt;considerations as subscribers of this list do.

I<br/>think it is enough -- fascinating, in fact -- to say that these guys were<br/>aware of the diatonic scale, that the scale is approximating a chain of<br/>seven 3:2&apos;s.</p></div>
