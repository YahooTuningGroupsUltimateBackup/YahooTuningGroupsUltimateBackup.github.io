If anything, I wish we had some sort of multi-individual<br/>&quot;government&quot; where even the &quot;president&quot; could not just randomly pass a judgment<br/>without approval from the other people in the &quot;government&quot;...I could only<br/>predict such a system would guard well against dictatorship.  Not picking on<br/>Carl in particular at all...but the situation of giving any one person near<br/>absolute power over something.</p><p>&gt;&quot;while resorting to group voting in the case of Margo. I wonder why you didn&apos;t<br/>&gt;just &quot;appoint&quot; her to her designated post?&quot;<br/>   True, in the closest thing we had to a formal vote, Margo won hands down.<br/>But, come to think of it, even if Margo had won, I wish there was a &quot;Board of<br/>Moderators&quot; here to make sure no one moderator was becoming too biased, out of<br/>hand, or generally non-democratic in his/her actions.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/2010 7:53:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl&gt;&quot;Best of luck to Mike, David, and Gene going forward!&quot;<br/>  Come to think of it, maybe it isn&apos;t as bad as I thought...</p><p>   On one hand, there was no formal vote.<br/>    On the other, had there been one it may well not have been much different<br/>and having three moderators, of sorts and no &quot;lead moderator&quot;, seems to imply no<br/>one person is going to go around telling.the others what to do.</p><p>   I, for one, am very glad Mike B managed to make the title.  From my<br/>experience he can be quite a critic, but a positive one both challenging of new<br/>ideas but ultimately open to them.  The positivity of and lack of flaming on his<br/>&quot;tuning-research&quot; list seems to show his potential...and his knowledge of<br/>psychoacoustics and related programming of it is, in my opinion, superb.<br/>   Same goes for picking Margo as a &quot;list mom&quot;...her temper control and &quot;A and<br/>B&quot; not (either) &quot;A or B&quot; view of conflicts and toward Western vs. Middle-Eastern<br/>historical scales seems very refreshing.  And I don&apos;t think Ozan should be so<br/>angry about it (seems to me he got things at least 50% his way).</p><p>   And I realize a lot of moderator (or related)&apos;s job is simply &quot;picking up<br/>trash&quot;...but I&apos;m pretty sure a lot of it will also be inspiring the rest of us.</p><p>   Best of luck to you both!</p></div><h3>Brofessor &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/2010 12:02:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At this point Ozan, I Suggest hitting the restart button, and give your and Mike&apos;s relationship a new start.<br/> I don&apos;t think that Mike will use these words as a moderator.<br/>Regardless of what happens, i think he will take his position seriously. Best to wish him well as i assume he will to you also.<br/>A vote would have been good , but as Carl said he had already asked Mike.<br/>Szanto would also have been a good choice and a few others.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So begins a new Medvedevian age.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Brofessor &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/2010 12:03:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Best luck to Mike and he has my support as well as deepest sympathy:)</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Folks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m pleased to announce that Mike Battaglia is now a moderator.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFhLCee3IP4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFhLCee3IP4</a><br/>&gt; (I find this performance pretty lifeless but I chose it<br/>&gt; because it&apos;s on period instruments)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been planning to pass the torch to Mike for some time,<br/>&gt; and recent events convinced me that now was the right one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Astute readers may notice that I still wear the crown next<br/>&gt; to my user ID.

It<br/>is quite a privilege for me to serve as moderator for this list. I<br/>assure you that I will clean up the files section and delete spammers<br/>with the best of them.</p><p>The main concern that I have is that the flaming on here has gotten<br/>pretty intense in this last month and a half. I think everyone&apos;s in<br/>agreement on that. I think that we can have an academically frank<br/>discussion of ideas without personal attacks coming into it. I also<br/>think, correspondingly, that one should not take criticism of their<br/>ideas personally. But there&apos;s no point in raising the issue now that<br/>it&apos;s all sort of died down.</p><p>You should all know that I will never moderate anyone for criticism of<br/>my moderational actions, or moderate anyone for having an idea that<br/>disagrees with the status quo, or anything like that.
