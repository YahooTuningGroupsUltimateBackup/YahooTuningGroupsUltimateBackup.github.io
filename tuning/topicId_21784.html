Some of these things I&apos;m<br/>putting all together for the first time.</p><p><a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a> wrote:</p><p>   I&apos;m having trouble understanding what you mean by usable notes in 72.</p><p>I guess the idea of a &quot;pitch continuum&quot; best describes it.</p><p>Dave Canright sent a reply to my original email which reads:</p><p>BTW, I was thinking more about 72ET as representing the harmonic series.</p><p>&gt;From a practical standpoint, you could consider 72ET to be a pitch<br/>continuum, where ANY interval is approximated well (with a maximum error<br/>of 8 1/3 cents), and this viewpoint is particularly appropriate to<br/>strings and such instruments, where the variable tuning is all by ear<br/>anyway. For fixed pitch instruments, it may be more reasonable to think<br/>of the 72 tones as only representing intervals that are &quot;nearby&quot; (the<br/>max error leads to ambiguity); in that view, the harmonic series is<br/>represented very well up to harmonic 12 (worst error 3.9c), but with 13<br/>the error jumps to 7.2c, so from there on, the approximations are not<br/>clear representations of the harmonic relations... IMHO anyway. So one<br/>may need to be content with &quot;only&quot; pure octaves, fifths, thirds,<br/>sevenths, ninths, and elevenths! Not bad!</p><p>-Dave</p><p>It&apos;s interesting in light of Dave&apos;s suggestion that Joe Manieri&apos;s book<br/>is called &quot;Preliminary Studies In The Virtual Pitch Continuum.&quot;</p><p>To get back to your next question</p><p>   Again, I&apos;m not quite seeing what you&apos;re trying to do hear, but I<br/>really doubt that appealing to the 43rd overtone is really going to be<br/>useful.</p><p>My line of thinking has been, &quot;what are all these ratios?&quot; mentioned on<br/>the tuning list, in terms of actual pitches?  You&apos;ll have to forgive me<br/>but my math education ended in the 12th grade.</p><p>Seeing the overtone series divided into its overlapping pitch<br/>duplications (at the octave) helps simplify a lot of the mystery.  When<br/>Lou talks about 81/80 as a threshold, I honestly can&apos;t say that I know<br/>what this means pitchwise.  Likewise with your thread regarding 75/64</p><p>Therefore I have constructed the overtone series, isolating octaves to<br/>seperate staves and thereby put some sound to the to the numbers.<br/>That&apos;s all.</p><p>I took the liberty of thinking maybe I could use the 72 to approximate<br/>these pitches, and although they reach the maximum error of 8 cents, it<br/>is tempting to give it a hearing.  It&apos;s actually a blast.</p><p>This exercise has, for me, led to a surprising vindication of 12-tET<br/>with its beautiful chromatic run 32, 34, 36, 38 and 48, 51, 54, and 57<br/>[in 72, that is, and with one 7&iuml;&iquest;&half; out note.]</p><p>There is a also a chromatic run on the -50&iuml;&iquest;&half; keyboard at 31, 33, 35, 37.<br/>The -33&iuml;&iquest;&half; keyboard has 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, and 63.  And the -67&iuml;&iquest;&half; keyboard<br/>has 46, 49, 52, 55, and 58 [all in 72 with some 8&iuml;&iquest;&half; errors.]</p><p>With these isolated errors carefully noted, the composer has the option<br/>to use them with this caveat, in compositional situations where the<br/>error can be masked, say piano (tuning) &quot;stretching&quot; or articulations<br/>like staccato or pizzicato.</p><p>When you ask me what I am hearing, I want to say another second to<br/>replace 9/8 but in reality there are many seconds as in Kiganda music<br/>which has fascinated me for years with its variable seconds ranging<br/>between 190 and 279 cents all on the same instrument.  Kubik goes to<br/>great lengths to explain, musically and linguistically,  how these<br/>intervals are considered the same.</p><p>Gerhard Kubik in an article &quot;Embaire Xylophone Music of Samusiri<br/>Babalanda&quot; in Composing the Music of Africa, edited by Malcolm Floyd,<br/>Ashgae, Brookfield USA, 1999 (very expensive) <a href="http://www.ashgate.com">www.ashgate.com</a> has an<br/>18-slat pentatonic xylophone tuning starting from low to high as:</p><p>273; 279; 196; 245; 207;<br/>230; 242; 241; 240; 269;<br/>190; 220; 256; 200; 240;<br/>249; 225.</p><p>The music is isorhythmic with two interlocking pentatonic melodies.<br/>Each melody has an octave ambitus and each is played in octaves very,<br/>very rapidly.</p><p>So I don&apos;t know if this answers your question but this is my line of<br/>thinking.  As to the 8+&iuml;&iquest;&half; error, I think you&apos;re right that it&apos;s<br/>stretching things.  In some ways, I guess, I&apos;m hoping that maybe the 72<br/>temperament might lessen the pain [of the 13th] and for now at least,<br/>keep the expense down of firing up yet another bank of synthesizers.</p><p>Yours,<br/>RT</p><p>P.S.  I came across an interesting website while researching 72 on the<br/>web</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/groepen.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/groepen.html</a></p><p>and from this site I got hold of Julia Werntz at the Boston Microtonal<br/>Society at 27 Valentine St., Cambridge, MA 02139.  Through her I&apos;m<br/>finally getting hold of Joe Manieri&apos;s book for which he is charging<br/>$20.  She mentioned that it is undergoing a revision.  She also just did<br/>her doctorate on equal temperments and is sending me her dissertation,<br/>so that should be an interesting read.</p></div><h3><a id=21790 href="#21790">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>4/28/2001 3:55:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Rick Tagawa &lt;ricktagawa@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; My line of thinking has been, &quot;what are all these ratios?&quot;<br/>mentioned on<br/>&gt; the tuning list, in terms of actual pitches?
