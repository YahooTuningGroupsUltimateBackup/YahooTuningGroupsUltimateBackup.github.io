I long considered the tuning to only be good for approximating 11-limit, which it does very well. But this time, it&apos;s 17-limit, which is doable in 72-equal. (Yes, I&apos;m preaching to the choir, I know.)</p><p>The 200-cent whole tone, of course, is divided into twelve equal parts. Dividing a ninth of a string length approximates this fair enough. This gives you a (utonal) chain of harmonics, the 96th through the 108th.</p><p>108/108 (0 commas): reduces to 1/1, the unison.<br/>108/107 (1)<br/>108/106 (2): reduces to 54/53, but 53 is a high prime I don&apos;t use.<br/>108/105 (3): reduces to 36/35, one of the two 11-limit quarter tones (the other is 33/32).<br/>108/104 (4): reduces to 27/26, a type of third tone.<br/>108/103 (5)<br/>108/102 (6): reduces to al-Farabi&apos;s semitone, 18/17.<br/>108/101 (7)<br/>108/100 (8): reduces to 27/25, a two-thirds tone (13/12 is a simpler one).<br/>108/99 (9): reduces to 12/11, al-Farabi&apos;s mujannab, the common three-quarter tone.<br/>108/98 (10): reduces to 54/49, what al-Farabi called &quot;Zalzal&apos;s mujannab&quot;. Similar to 11/10.<br/>108/97 (11)<br/>108/96 (12): reduces to 9/8, the whole tone.</p><p>Leaving out the excessively high primes (53, 97, 101, 103 and 107), all prime numbers from 2 to 17 are represented in factorizations, approximated in roughly decreasing precision in 72-tone. Third and quarter tones are expressed in simple ratios. It also covers many of al-Farabi&apos;s ratios in their divisions of the tetrachord, and touches on the 13-based ratios proposed by Avicenna.</p><p>Those four ratios I threw out because of the primes well beyond 17 can be replaced with others, typically 81/80, 64/63, 21/20, 16/15 and 10/9, so it is very possible to use all 72 pitch classes in a 72-edo composition, even within these constraints. But again, I&apos;m NOT touting 72-tone as the greatest of all; it&apos;s just my personal favorite right now.</p><p>~D.</p></div>
