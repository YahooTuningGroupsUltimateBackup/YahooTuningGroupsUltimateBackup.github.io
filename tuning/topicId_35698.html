Therefore,<br/>since Paul wouldn&apos;t have intentionally changed the actual pitch as it<br/>emerged, and because the sounding triad was quite beatless, I concluded that<br/>jerry00 was JI. Yet the third sounding in the triad appeared higher than the<br/>naked one. *That* was my moment of insight. My whole world (well, *this* one<br/>anyway) changed.</p><p>Bob, you call the naked third &quot;flat.&quot; Okay, but it *is* JI. (Otherwise, why<br/>would the triad be beatless.) You&apos;re very reluctant to acknowledge it, but I<br/>think we&apos;re pretty much hearing the same thing. You&apos;re just describing it<br/>differently. To you, evidently, the third in the triad is the *true* JI, and<br/>the *real* one is &quot;flat.&quot; Think about it. (I knew your involvement here<br/>would be valuable.)</p><p>Incidentally, most of the other jerries sound rather high to me, as well<br/>they should, since they are somewhat &quot;out of &quot;tune.&quot;  Since my vocalized<br/>*intentional* high third (as opposed to the JI one) sounds rather good with<br/>jerry00, I&apos;m curious as to whether a &quot;well-tuned&quot; real high third might also<br/>sound &quot;right,&quot; if not &quot;consonant.&quot; Maybe the damn thing works backwards, as<br/>well.</p><p>(Hey, guys and gals, I&apos;ve got a golf tournament today.

No one I know thinks one &quot;needs the fifth present to hear just<br/>thirds as in tune.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To clarify previous discussions in light of responses from Jerry,<br/>&gt; please let me know, Jerry, if this is a fair summary of your<br/>&gt; perceptions:</p><p>Didn&apos;t we just do this? Okay, let&apos;s go.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) You, as I have (but no longer seem to), hear a difference in<br/>&gt; subjective pitch between a stand-alone third and that same third<br/>&gt; (frequency and timbre unchanged) in context with the root and fifth<br/>&gt; justly tuned to each other and the third. The stand-alone third<br/>&gt; sounds subjectively lower than the third in context with the justly<br/>&gt; tuned triad.</p><p>Yep.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) You feel that this subjective perception of a relative upward<br/>&gt; shift in pitch in the triad as opposed to the stand-alone perception<br/>&gt; of pitch conditions the ear to hear the &quot;right&quot; third as higher than<br/>&gt; the 4:5 third alone, and therefore musicians tend intuitively to<br/>&gt; compensate for the shift by singing or playing the stand-alone pitch<br/>&gt; higher than 4:5.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what the &quot;right&quot; third is. What I have been calling the &quot;high<br/>third&quot; is higher than the ET third. I don&apos;t know that I would call it<br/>&quot;compensate.&quot; I sang the &quot;high third&quot; all of my professional life (I<br/>believe) simply because I didn&apos;t know any better. Judging from what I hear<br/>around me, other folks do too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) You further feel that this new, higher third gets injected back<br/>&gt; into the triad so that is is no longer just, but is rather even<br/>&gt; higher than a 12-tET third.</p><p>As you surely remember, you initially heard a third in jerry00 higher than<br/>the naked 4:5. From what you said at that time, that third was not &quot;new&quot; to<br/>you. It simply was the &quot;right&quot; third and the naked one was &quot;flat.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;high&quot; third is not something I invented. It&apos;s something I have<br/>observed. By the way, have you done the &quot;experiment&quot; yet with your choir?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4) You also feel that this new higher third sounds &quot;in tune&quot; to<br/>&gt; musicians&apos; ears; even more in tune than either the 12-tET or the just<br/>&gt; third.</p><p>More in tune than the 12-tET third, to be sure. And certainly *not* more in<br/>tune than the just third. The issue here, as I see it, is simply to<br/>determine what actual &quot;high third&quot; pitch (if any) seems to sound &quot;in tune&quot;<br/>when sung with the JI triad. If we find one--cool. If we don&apos;t find<br/>one--also cool. Either way, it doesn&apos;t change my *perception* of the &quot;high<br/>third,&quot; but it might change our understanding of it.</p><p>&gt; I welcome your corrections to or confirmation of this summary of your<br/>&gt; hypotheses on this issue, Jerry.</p><p>I hope this helps, Bob. Thanks for asking. (Please forgive my impatience.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gratefully,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob</p><p>Do the experiment!!!!  :-)</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
