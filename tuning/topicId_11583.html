It is a<br/>&gt;melodic construct in its divination, from two 9/8 whole tones.  Now the<br/>large<br/>&gt;204 cent whole tone is probably etched in everyone&apos;s mind after some<br/>hundreds<br/>&gt;of years.  It is this stretch upwards (distinguishing it from either an 8/9</p><p>&gt;or a meantone whole tone is especially easy to reproduce.  It is after all<br/>&gt;the full step.  Reproducing it a second time is simple enough, no?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>But we were talking about beating, which occurs in harmonic, not melodic,<br/>intervals.</p><p>&gt;Also, I bet most of the usage of 81/64 is in the upper ranges, based on<br/>&gt;Paul&apos;s input.  The higher range always moved the fastest, and through the<br/>&gt;most melisma.  But really now this historic info may not alter at all what<br/>a<br/>&gt;modern will make of it.  I was passing on what I had learned, that the<br/>81/64<br/>&gt;beat enough times as to mask its egregiousness.</p><p>Interesting. Now if there is a rate of beating that best helps mask<br/>egregiousness, then every just interval will have both an upper and a lower<br/>version which beats at that rate, and the separation of these versions will<br/>depend on register. There&apos;s an idea for a new tuning system!</p></div>
