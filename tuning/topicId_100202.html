Until recently I responded<br/>&gt; to anything with a pulse on this list, to the best of my<br/>&gt; ability. The cause of the problem you&apos;re blaming on me is<br/>&gt; your tendency to indulge in long, wandering and often<br/>&gt; insulting diatribes while being mortally allergic to<br/>&gt; admitting your mistakes.</p><p>I write longer replies because the discussions that we&apos;re having are<br/>usually too complicated to explain things briefly. This is doubly true<br/>when my job is to explain complicated mathematical concepts to an<br/>audience that doesn&apos;t have a similar background. Your insistence on<br/>keeping every message very short makes effective communication<br/>impossible. Your repeated assertions about not assuming that people<br/>know things, needing to explain everything rigorously and thoroughly<br/>as though you were a homeless guy with no knowledge of the subject,<br/>and still keeping messages short - are completely self-inconsistent.<br/>Can you imagine if we were to start yelling at Gene to shorten his<br/>pages on the xenwiki because they&apos;re unnecessarily long? If we want<br/>him to make them more readable, that would only require him to make<br/>them longer by annotating them.</p><p>In real life, in a scientific society like this, people not only have<br/>lengthy discussions, but they also write very long papers, sometimes<br/>dozens of pages long, for one another to read. It is expected for<br/>someone being critical of a work to understand it in its entirety<br/>before doing so, or to ask questions about the things that they do not<br/>understand. My experience with almost everyone on this list is that<br/>people are more than willing to adopt a similar attitude of polite<br/>inquisition - and so am I! You can observe how I&apos;ve been asking Kalle<br/>about his views on tonality, how our exchanges have been very long but<br/>refreshingly detailed, how I&apos;ve changed my opinion on the importance<br/>of melodic leading tones, how we&apos;ve been posting musical examples to<br/>one another to back up our points. I&apos;ve had similar experiences with<br/>Igs recently, as well as Cameron, and also Petr with regards to his<br/>opinions on comma pumps. In addition, I notice all of these people<br/>having pleasant and polite interactions with one another, and I notice<br/>everyone changing their opinion in the face of valid criticism.</p><p>In contrast, and in opposition to your claim that I&apos;m prone to writing<br/>&quot;insulting diatribes,&quot; here&apos;s an example of a series of posts that<br/>illustrates a typical conversation between us:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/98509">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/98509</a><br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/98520">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/98520</a><br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/98522">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/98522</a><br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/98522">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/98522</a></p><p>Then, meanwhile, while Petr and I were going back and forth in an<br/>unbelievably refreshing and detailed conversation, posting examples<br/>for one another and all that, you write this:</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/98539">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/98539</a></p><p>This sort of thing happens roughly once per month in my interactions<br/>only with you. I don&apos;t notice anyone else telling me that I write<br/>&quot;insulting diatribes,&quot; and frankly I enjoy conversation with everyone<br/>else a lot more.</p><p>&gt; Take the last thread about<br/>&gt; periodicity buzz, which you ending with a provocation that<br/>&gt; the numerous peripheral and false statements about physics<br/>&gt; and signal processing you made were somehow correct.</p><p>Please, go right ahead, point out a single signal processing statement<br/>I&apos;ve made in that thread that was false - please! Post a single one.<br/>Any one will do! In fact, let&apos;s hope it&apos;s the one about what aliasing<br/>does to the spectrum of a sampled signal, so I can just post some math<br/>and be done with it! Or please, try to disprove the model by citing<br/>ERB widths again! Or also, why don&apos;t you point out how you believe<br/>that sampling doesn&apos;t cause periodicity in the spectrum! Make it easy<br/>for me.</p><p>What actually happened is that the thread ended with you asserting an<br/>unfalsifiable theory about periodicity buzz resulting from an<br/>undefined property called &quot;spikiness,&quot; and me offering to spend MY OWN<br/>FREE TIME devising listening examples to help you test it once you<br/>figure it out. Please note that I&apos;m actually helping you to develop an<br/>opposing theory that, if correct, would completely usurp mine. And<br/>I&apos;ll tell you what: if it is correct, we can call it the &quot;Lumma Theory<br/>of Periodicity Buzz&quot; if you want! In fact, since it&apos;s not really<br/>&quot;periodicity buzz,&quot; we can even call it &quot;Lumma buzz.&quot; I couldn&apos;t give<br/>a shit if all the world knows if your model wins and mine loses. In<br/>fact, instead of telling you to pull your own weight for a change in<br/>the discussion and to do the work yourself in developing your<br/>competing model, I&apos;ve offered to basically do 100% of the grunt work<br/>for it in MATLAB. I want to hear some acknowledgement from you about<br/>this fact rather than this bullshit about how I&apos;m trying to &quot;one-up&quot;<br/>you and can&apos;t admit ever being wrong.</p><p>As it stands, the cochlear model is the only one that accurately<br/>predicts the behavior of this phenomenon, and is also the only<br/>reasonable choice I&apos;ve seen proposed in order to predict where the<br/>behavior comes from, unless there&apos;s a second critical band in the<br/>brain (which I&apos;ve left open as a possibility this whole time). No, I&apos;m<br/>not going to pretend that this is not the case just because you have<br/>yet to finish defining your opposing theory. This is especially true<br/>when I&apos;ve spent months coming up with a couple dozen listening<br/>examples, detailed plots of the gammatone-simulated cochlear response<br/>to the examples, experiments showing how buzz varies roughly inversely<br/>proportional to the uniformity of the group delay of the signal, all<br/>of which I generated the theory in RESPONSE to, and not only do you<br/>have yet to produce anything, but you still haven&apos;t come up with a<br/>cogent argument against anything I&apos;ve done. And if you do, I&apos;ll gladly<br/>start promoting your theory instead of mine.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=100211 href="#100211">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2011 10:00:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;Your insistence on keeping every message very short makes effective communication</p><p>impossible...Your repeated assertions about not assuming that people</p><p>know things, needing to explain everything rigorously and thoroughly</p><p>as though you were a homeless guy with no knowledge of the subject,</p><p>and still keeping messages short - are completely self-inconsistent.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smell a double standard.&nbsp; There are a few people on here who both insult others for &quot;not putting in enough effort to explain&quot; and at the same time &quot;going on too long&quot;.&nbsp; Unless we are full of people who are such inexperienced communicators it takes them huge lengths to explain even simple things (which I seriously doubt)...maybe we should consider either focusing on one or the other primarily.&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally my view is why not go in long detail (as long as it&apos;s on topic)...people who don&apos;t like long e-mails can delete them or filter senders who tend to write long messages.</p><p>&gt;&quot;It is expected for someone being critical of a work to understand it in its entirety</p><p>before doing so&quot;<br/>&nbsp; Right, so it begs one would actually ASK for a detailed (and quite often long) explanation so they know what&apos;s intended before they start criticizing it.&nbsp; Otherwise you end up with a straw-man scenario where you end up disproving a theory out of your own misinterpretation...that no one brought up in the first place...</p><p>&gt;&quot;In fact, since it&apos;s not really &quot;periodicity buzz,&quot; we can even call it &quot;Lumma buzz.&quot; I couldn&apos;t give a shit if all the world knows if your model wins and mine loses.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;ve had similar experiences with displaying my own theories here...specifically about a PHI-sections scale, which Carl labelled as &quot;the Noble Mediant&quot; (and confused/misinformed a lot of people on here by doing so) for over a year before an AUTHOR of the Noble Mediant paper admitted what I was doing was different.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if people hate my or MikeB&apos;s theories to death...at the very least we deserve to have your theories recognized for what they are.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, why not get away from the insults and make some actually Lumma-buzz vs. Periodicity-Buzz examples?
