Since some point, researchers<br/>found out that the polarity on the Sun reverses every HALF WAVE,<br/>and therefore the WAVELENGTH is really circa 22.22 Earth years in length.<br/>This is defined as a tradtional EMF [Electro-Magnetic Force] wave [I did<br/>discuss this at length in my ON THE SPECIAL THEORY OF ORDER paper, and<br/>now wish to relate it, specifically, to musicology].</p><p>The circa 11.11 Earth year wave was incorrectly viewed as a DC wave,<br/><a href="http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/sun/activity/butterfly.html">http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/sun/activity/butterfly.html</a><br/>with all the pulses moving in the same direction, and the circa 22.22 Earth<br/>year wave is AC, and now considered the proper way to view the data.  That<br/>is: Direct Current and Alternating Current; the latter AC WAVE considered<br/>proper to describe the SUNSPOT full-wave circa 22.22 Earth year cycle.</p><p>In addition, the BUTTERFLY PATTERN shows interesting characteristics,<br/><a href="http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/sun/activity/butterfly.html">http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/sun/activity/butterfly.html</a><br/>and aides astrophysicists in SEEING the statistic distribution pattern<br/>of the data more clearly.</p><p>In summary, I ask: do musicologists talk of the WAVELENGTH as a DC pulse<br/>type wave, or an AC positive and negative wave?  On the Hyper-Physics<br/>website, there is a suggestion that by WAVELENGTH musicologists mean an<br/>AC positive and negative wave, as follows:</p><p>Traverse Waves<br/>and<br/>Longitudinal Waves:<br/><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html</a></p><p>Am I correct to conclude, then, that when WAVELENGTH is discussed in<br/>musicology it is as you say:</p><p>See LONGITUDINAL SOUND WAVES IN AIR:<br/><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html</a></p><p>and thereby I note, I hope accurately, that it has an AC characteristic,<br/>the positive ( + ) phase when it exhibits increased pressure and the<br/>negative ( - ) phase when it exhibits decreased pressure in air?</p><p>If so: then we should also be agreed that LONGITUDINAL SOUND WAVES IN AIR<br/><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html</a><br/>can be measured in WAVELENGTH from note to node as well, that is, three<br/>ways altogether: from (1) node to node, from (2) crest to crest, and<br/>(3) trough to trough?</p><p>Lastly, for now:<br/>Have the physical parameters of the WAVELENGTH of a sound been so<br/>studied, similarly to SUNSPOTS and DIFFRACTION PATTERNS OF ATOMS?<br/><a href="http://www.hcc.hawaii.edu/hcconline/sci122/Programs/p28/p28.html">http://www.hcc.hawaii.edu/hcconline/sci122/Programs/p28/p28.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.molecularuniverse.com/mile/mile1.htm">http://www.molecularuniverse.com/mile/mile1.htm</a></p><p>Sound Waves In Air:<br/>Scroll Down to:<br/><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html</a><br/>and<br/>Butterfly Pattern:<br/><a href="http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/sun/activity/butterfly.html">http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/sun/activity/butterfly.html</a></p><p>Have they attempted to map a sort of PATTERN for sound<br/>similar to the BUTTERFLY PATTERN or the  DIFFRACTION PATTERNS of<br/>Ernest Rutherford&apos;s and Niels Bohr&apos;s work on atoms?<br/><a href="http://www.molecularuniverse.com/mile/mile1.htm">http://www.molecularuniverse.com/mile/mile1.htm</a></p><p>Recall from above, as described according to the HyperPhysics website:<br/>&quot;the WAVELENGTH of a sound or note of 100 Hz is circa 3.45 meters,<br/>and a sound or note of 2000 Hz is circa 18 cm.&quot;</p><p>If the SOUND WAVES IN AIR PATTERN were shown for each NOTE,<br/>i.e., 100 Hz at circa 3.45 meters or 2000 Hz at circa 18 cm,<br/>one at a time, all NOTES which musicologists talk about in terms<br/>of frequency but less so in terms of WAVELENGTH, then it appears<br/>each would show a distinctive unique PATTERN which would radiate<br/>out SPHERICALLY from the source and be MAPPABLE?</p><p>Has such been done?
