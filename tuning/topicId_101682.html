Can anyone help bring me up<br/>&gt; to speed?</p><p>One interesting thing about Laka is that there&apos;s a two-way,<br/>one-to-one mapping with 5-limit just intonation.  Not all<br/>rank 3 temperaments do this.  You can find a 5-limit<br/>interval that has to be equally divided.  So, Laka doesn&apos;t<br/>require this, you can use any 5-limit notation you like and<br/>apply a Laka tuning map.  I don&apos;t know if that does make<br/>Scala easier.  If you can think of a way of writing it with<br/>Lilypond note names, I&apos;ll implement it.</p><p>The other thing about Laka is that it doesn&apos;t look very<br/>interesting.  There are a lot of rank 3 temperaments<br/>that come out better by my scoring.  It has the one-to-one<br/>5-limit property, but to get 17-limit harmony from a convex<br/>scale on the 5-limit lattice, you need a heck of a lot of<br/>notes.  There are plenty of 17-limit alternatives (maybe<br/>100) with the same property that look better.</p><p>Laka&apos;s more competitive in the 13-limit.  Here are<br/>alternatives with the one-to-one 5-limit property that<br/>score more highly:</p><p>Marvel (31&amp;53&amp;72)<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=53_72_31&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=53_72_31&limit=13</a></p><p>Hecate (41&amp;53&amp;72)<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=41_72_53&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=41_72_53&limit=13</a></p><p>Pele (41&amp;58&amp;87)<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=41_58_87&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=41_58_87&limit=13</a></p><p>Marvel and Hecate are both extensions of 11-limit Marvel.<br/>Pele is another member of the Hemifamity family.</p><p>                       Graham</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2011 9:15:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Marvel (31&amp;53&amp;72)<br/>&gt; <a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=53_72_31&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=53_72_31&limit=13</a></p><p>I can&apos;t find this listed, though clearly it should be.

And even more so if<br/>&gt; Graham&apos;s already named it Hecate?</p><p>The thing I&apos;m calling Marvel is has the lowest<br/>Tenney-Euclidean (TE) badness for all (reasonable)<br/>parameters.  That follows from it having the lowest TE<br/>complexity.  But TE complexity is an abstract thing, and<br/>won&apos;t always correlate with real world complexity.  In<br/>these cases, the tempered 13-limit lattices are isomorphic<br/>with the 5-limit JI lattice, so you&apos;re likely to borrow a<br/>notation for 5-limit JI.  In that case, 2-3-5 is a<br/>privileged basis and we don&apos;t need the &quot;scalar&quot; property of<br/>TE complexity that it doesn&apos;t depend on the choice of<br/>generators.</p><p>The 5-limit basis of 13-limit Marvel (coinciding with<br/>hermite normal form) is:</p><p>[&lt;1 0 0 -5 12 -4]<br/> &lt;0 1 0 2 -1 -1]<br/> &lt;0 0 1 2 -3 4]&gt;</p><p>The addition of 13:1 means you need two more steps of 5:1<br/>beyond what you needed for the 11-limit, but no additional<br/>steps of 2:1 or 3:1.  In notational terms, that means you<br/>keep the same note names but you need more comma shifts,<br/>which is relatively expensive.</p><p>The corresponding basis for Hecate is:</p><p>[&lt;1 0 0 -5 12 2]<br/> &lt;0 1 0 2 -1 4]<br/> &lt;0 0 1 2 -3 -2]&gt;</p><p>This need two more steps of 3:1 relative to the 11-limit,<br/>but no more steps of 2:1 or 5:1.  That saves us comma<br/>shifts, so it appears to be simpler than Marvel.</p><p>I chose Marvel to be the mapping with lower TE complexity<br/>because it fills in gaps in some badness listings.  That<br/>looks like as good a reason as any.  While it isn&apos;t a<br/>compelling name, I do object to changing it now because<br/>I&apos;ve been assigning names to these temperaments over the<br/>past year when I was trying to understand them and reading<br/>up on mythology to find good names. Changing the names now<br/>puts up another barrier to my understanding.</p><p>Anyway, let&apos;s try and understand the alternatives relative<br/>to the 5-limit.  One thing we can do is transform the<br/>mappings into Kelley&apos;s chromatic/diatonic/arp format and<br/>work out what a 13:8 looks like.  The results are:</p><p>Marvel --&gt; [9 4 2&gt;<br/>Hecate --&gt; [8 5 3&gt;<br/>Tripod --&gt; [9 4 3&gt;<br/>Isis --&gt; [8 6 1&gt;</p><p>Note that Hecate is the only one where the neutral sixth<br/>is written as a sixth.  Most extended notations measure<br/>pitches relative to a Pythagorean diatonic.  Lets fix C as<br/>the 1/1.  Then the relative section of the scale is</p><p>G --&gt; [7 4 2&gt;<br/>A --&gt; [9 5 3&gt;<br/>B --&gt; [11 6 4&gt;</p><p>Using # and b for sharp and flat (approximating 25:24) and +<br/>and - to raise or lower by a comma (approximating 81:80), we<br/>can write 13:8 above C according to the different mappings</p><p>Marvel --&gt; G##<br/>Hecate --&gt; Ab<br/>Tripod --&gt; G##+<br/>Isis --&gt; Bbbb---</p><p>Hecate is the simplest spelling although Tripod is the<br/>simplest mapping.  (And, yes, Tripod temperament is simple<br/>to write in Tripod Notation.)</p><p>Unfortunately, the Pythagorean sharp doesn&apos;t approximate<br/>25:24.  It comes out as &lt;1 0 2] in terms of chromatic,<br/>diatonic, and arp steps.  This changes our spellings.</p><p>Marvel --&gt; G##----<br/>Hecate -&gt; Ab++<br/>Tripod -&gt; G##---<br/>Isis -&gt; Bbbb+++</p><p>For all of them, you&apos;re likely to want specialist<br/>accidental symbols.  That makes the complexity harder to<br/>estimate.</p><p>We can also look at 13:8 relative to 5-limit intervals.  In<br/>Hecate, 13:8 is written as a minor sixth.  The 5-limit<br/>minor sixth, 8:5, is [8 5 2&gt;.  That means 13:8 approximates<br/>as a comma sharp of an 8:5 minor sixth in Hecate.  In<br/>Marvel, 13:8 is a diesis flat of a 5:3 major sixth mapping<br/>as [9 5 2&gt;.  That might be convenient if you have a symbol<br/>for diesis shifts.</p><p>In Isis, the 11:9 and 16:13 neutral thirds add up to a 3:2<br/>perfect fifth.  The spelling of the 16:13 is ugly because<br/>so is 11:9.  In 11-limit Marvel, 11:9 maps to<br/>chromatic/diatonic/arp as [3 3 0&gt;.  The 11:9 above C would<br/>be written as Fbb+++.  And that&apos;s equally ugly for all of<br/>the 13-limit alternatives.</p><p>Maybe you&apos;d define a &quot;quartertone&quot; symbol for the [1 -1 2&gt;<br/>by which Fb+++ is flat of E.  (E above C is [4 2 2&gt;.  [4 2<br/>2&gt; - [1 -1 2&gt; = 3 3 0&gt;.)  A guess would be that 16:13 is<br/>2&gt; the quartertone above Eb.  That means [4 2 2&gt; - [1 0 2&gt;<br/>2&gt; + &lt;1 -1 2] = &lt;4 1 2].  This difference between this and<br/>2&gt; the octave is &lt;12 7 3] - &lt;4 1 2] = &lt;8 6 1].  Hence this<br/>2&gt; corresponds to the Isis mapping.</p><p>If we want a new name for 13-limit Marvel, one option is to<br/>name it relative to Hecate.  (I think Hecate is a good<br/>name, and Isis is already related.)  Marvel (as it is now)<br/>and Hecate have similar complexity and error so it makes<br/>sense to pair them.  One option is Demeter.  She was in the<br/>pantheon and doesn&apos;t currently have any temperaments named<br/>after her.  According to Wikipedia, she was, like Hecate, a<br/>triune goddess:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter#Greek_mythology">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter#Greek_mythology</a></p><p>Hecate has counterparts in related cultures:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecate#Cross-cultural_parallels">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecate#Cross-cultural_parallels</a></p><p>Isis and Artemis are already (deliberately) taken.  There&apos;s<br/>also Ereshkigal, which is good in that she was important<br/>and outside Greece (if anybody worries about a Greek bias),<br/>but bad in that it&apos;s quite a long name. Juno gets mentioned<br/>in the Apuleius quote as well. Funnily enough, we currently<br/>have neither Juno nor Hera temperaments.  But if we did<br/>maybe they should be related to Zeus or Jove.</p><p>And there&apos;s Hermes, a god related (if accidentally) to<br/>magicians and alchemists.  Maybe not to replace Marvel, but<br/>9&amp;53&amp;72 is still unnamed:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=9_72_53&limit=13">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=9_72_53&limit=13</a></p><p>                         Graham</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2011 12:09:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; This is describing how the scale Gene posted fails to be a &quot;constant structure&quot; (or &quot;epimorphic&quot;, which implies &quot;constant structure&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How does epimorphicity imply constant structure?

So in JI they could not possibly be the same. In fact, the only way they could be the same is if the interval between them - which does not map to 0 under the val - is tempered out.</p><p>If our scale consists of notes from some temperament that can be expressed as a wedge product of vals, one of which is the particular val v corresponding to scale steps, then all the commas of the temperament must have v(c) = 0. So if no other commas are &quot;accidentally&quot; tempered out, epimorphicity implies constant structure.</p><p>In other words, epimorphicity does imply constant structure as long as the actual temperament you&apos;re using can be expressed as a wedge product *that includes the val under which the scale is epimorphic*.</p><p>In your example, if you tuned the generator to 3/2, you&apos;d have the Pythagorean[7] MOS, which is CS because it is epimorphic (per above). However, if you tune the generator to *exactly* 700 cents, then you&apos;re &quot;accidentally&quot; tempering out 531441/524288, so the &quot;augmented fourth&quot; and &quot;diminished fifth&quot; both become 600 cents and it&apos;s no longer CS.</p><p>In other words, if the generator is 3/2 your temperament is rank-2 Pythagorean, which can be expressed as the wedge product of vals 7 ^ 12. But if the generator is exactly 700 cents it becomes a rank-1 temperament, which can only be expressed as the single val 12. The 7 val is no longer part of it, so it&apos;s no longer guaranteed to be CS.</p><p>If Gene had given a scale in Laka temperament that was epimorphic under the val, let&apos;s see... 29efggg, then it would be easy to make it constant structure simply by choosing a tuning that doesn&apos;t temper out any commas other than those of Laka itself. But instead the scale he gave was neither epimorphic nor constant structure, hence manuphonic&apos;s question.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/24/2011 3:47:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; though since you&apos;ve decided to turn this into a food-fight and pizzas and hamburgers are flying though the air, that may be less likely.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The only one I see resorting to verbal abuse here is you, Gene.</p><p>Jocular comments like &quot;blow it out your ears and rub it in your hair&quot; and references to flying pizzas is &quot;verbal abuse&quot;?

Although the board can be tuned otherwise I prefer to explore either the default or its 41ed2 core. The wiki mentions Laka among the temperaments that 205ed2 can deliver.</p><p>Also, Laka is described as a 17-limit minimax temperament. The word minimax reminds me of Miracle, which I consider great fun.

Can anyone help bring me up<br/>&gt; &gt; to speed?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One interesting thing about Laka is that there&apos;s a two-way,<br/>&gt; one-to-one mapping with 5-limit just intonation.  Not all<br/>&gt; rank 3 temperaments do this.  You can find a 5-limit<br/>&gt; interval that has to be equally divided.  So, Laka doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; require this, you can use any 5-limit notation you like and<br/>&gt; apply a Laka tuning map.  I don&apos;t know if that does make<br/>&gt; Scala easier.  If you can think of a way of writing it with<br/>&gt; Lilypond note names, I&apos;ll implement it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The other thing about Laka is that it doesn&apos;t look very<br/>&gt; interesting.  There are a lot of rank 3 temperaments<br/>&gt; that come out better by my scoring.  It has the one-to-one<br/>&gt; 5-limit property, but to get 17-limit harmony from a convex<br/>&gt; scale on the 5-limit lattice, you need a heck of a lot of<br/>&gt; notes.  There are plenty of 17-limit alternatives (maybe<br/>&gt; 100) with the same property that look better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Laka&apos;s more competitive in the 13-limit.

That seems like a reasonable amount of research<br/>to me.  You could also list whatever names you want on one<br/>of the pages I scrape, and leave me to deal with the<br/>collisions.  I&apos;d prefer you didn&apos;t do that because it<br/>pushes the work onto me, but you can still do it.

Really?</p><p>&gt;   I keep a central database with sanity checks<br/>&gt; &gt; and some of the names in it were pulled directly from<br/>&gt; &gt; the wiki.  Sometimes my checks flag errors in the wiki,<br/>&gt; &gt; and I correct them.  That makes my database reliable and<br/>&gt; &gt; comprehensive, and you can easily query it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I&apos;m supposed to query it at random, or is your<br/>&gt; complaint that I said a name wasn&apos;t listed when in fact<br/>&gt; it was in your database? Saying a name isn&apos;t listed on<br/>&gt; the Xenwiki hardly strikes me as a major crime, or even a<br/>&gt; peccadillo, so I presume the crime in question is that by<br/>&gt; asking for a name proposal I suggested it hadn&apos;t already<br/>&gt; been named, whereas if I had fed the right commas into<br/>&gt; your app it would have come up as &quot;marvel&quot;, and if I was<br/>&gt; a mind-reader I would have known you were proposing that<br/>&gt; as a name, and not simply making nonce use of it. This<br/>&gt; whole thing is ridiculous.</p><p>It&apos;s fine for a name not to be listed on the Xenwiki.  The<br/>rules regarding my database and the Xenwiki are very<br/>simple.

If you don&apos;t, then I won&apos;t know<br/>about it, which is fine but don&apos;t then get in my ear about<br/>it being in use.</p><p>This business of &quot;nonce use&quot; is a diversion you invented.<br/>You don&apos;t know if it&apos;s a &quot;nonce use&quot; and neither does<br/>anybody else.  So it&apos;s reasonable to assume that the name<br/>might be picked up, and respect any precedent unless you<br/>have a good reason to say otherwise.

Could you help me a little bit? You list a number of temperaments that would be approximated well by 205tet,  right?<br/>For instance, what&apos;s the double cicle of diaschismic temperament? And what are hemithirds?<br/>How many notes do those scales have? If less than 205, then the pitches belonging to the scale would have to be found among the 205 keys (the other keys could be re-tuned to duplicates). If more than 205, some kind of selection would have to be made. (Using what principle?)</p><p>Unless you are only talking about the 205 keys of the keyboard (midi notes), and what temperaments could be mapped onto them.</p><p>My experience with the TPX is that even though any tunings can be mapped to the keys, and even though in the default tuning, transposed patterns have similar shapes, it is not really a genralized keyboard; it definitely works best with the default 205tet tuning. With that tuning, it&apos;s an excellent tool for trying out harmonies and melodies.<br/> The 41tet fifths are practically pure, and you can approximate any other interval with a maximun error of 3 cents. That&apos;s part of the reasoning behind 205 but it has also to do with the keyboard layout. It&apos;s divided into 41 areas that each have 5 keys, and the keys are physically different so that moving on a 41-chain of fifths you always move  to a corresponding, same-shaped key in another area. So the middle keys of these areas make up a chain of 41 virtully pure fifths, and to make a correction (ca. 6 or 12 cents up or down) from those 41tet pitches you play a key one or twor steps lower or higher than the middle key.</p><p>Juhani</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The problem is, 205 isn&apos;t that great a division.

The bowl-topped center keys of the black &amp; white keystrips are identical with Garibaldi 17. This offers excellent &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; with familiar diatonic &amp; chromatic music, Ellis &amp; Pythagoras, while including some nice higher harmonics. If you choose prime limit 7 &amp; odd limit 27, as I did, then Garibaldi is impressively symmetrical in terms of the chords possible in each of its key signatures.

Could you help me a little bit? You list a number of temperaments that would be approximated well by 205tet,  right?<br/>&gt; For instance, what&apos;s the double cicle of diaschismic temperament? And what are hemithirds?<br/>&gt; How many notes do those scales have? If less than 205, then the pitches belonging to the scale would have to be found among the 205 keys (the other keys could be re-tuned to duplicates). If more than 205, some kind of selection would have to be made. (Using what principle?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Unless you are only talking about the 205 keys of the keyboard (midi notes), and what temperaments could be mapped onto them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My experience with the TPX is that even though any tunings can be mapped to the keys, and even though in the default tuning, transposed patterns have similar shapes, it is not really a genralized keyboard; it definitely works best with the default 205tet tuning. With that tuning, it&apos;s an excellent tool for trying out harmonies and melodies.<br/>&gt;  The 41tet fifths are practically pure, and you can approximate any other interval with a maximun error of 3 cents. That&apos;s part of the reasoning behind 205 but it has also to do with the keyboard layout. It&apos;s divided into 41 areas that each have 5 keys, and the keys are physically different so that moving on a 41-chain of fifths you always move  to a corresponding, same-shaped key in another area. So the middle keys of these areas make up a chain of 41 virtully pure fifths, and to make a correction (ca. 6 or 12 cents up or down) from those 41tet pitches you play a key one or twor steps lower or higher than the middle key.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Juhani<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is, 205 isn&apos;t that great a division.

I&apos;d assumed I would be using it with numerous JI mappings of my own design, as well as for 31, 53 etc. But as a composer who mainly writes in JI, I&apos;ve found the master tuning the best way to try out intervals and harmonies on the TPX. As I explained here: <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/101738">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/101738</a> , the keyboard design is not as generalized as that of other array keyboards but it&apos;s physically and visually tied to the 5*41 principle.<br/>What I have done however, is that I&apos;ve created tunings for specific pieces of mine, ones that use maybe 35 pitch classes in Just Intonation, so that I&apos;ve replaced the keys that those pitches would be played on in the master 205tet tuning with the precise, untempered notes. (Of course this won&apos;t work in those few cases where the same key represents two ratios).
