Never had a problem &quot;getting it&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Same thing with your music John.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wish we could all learn to laugh when we are doing our labors of<br/>&gt; love. Laughter and good humor is all important for keeping the soul<br/>&gt; in *tune*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keep up the groovy work and *never* stop having that sense of humor!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon</p><p>Thanks Jacky.
