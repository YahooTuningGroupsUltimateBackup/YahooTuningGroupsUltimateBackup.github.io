And while even the slightest bit of distortion might<br/>be too much distortion for some tastes or contexts...

One of my very favorite things about the fretless *is* the faux<br/>string bends... and though (somewhat alarming) things like ever so<br/>slightly rolling your finger forwards or backwards are a particular<br/>favorite of mine, some players do take a much more straightforward<br/>approach... or perhaps use the fretless as a more colorful and<br/>intonationally detailed interpreter of more orthodox contexts<br/>(&lt;<a href="http://www22.pair.com/taxim/items/tx2036.htm">http://www22.pair.com/taxim/items/tx2036.htm</a>&gt; would be one such<br/>example of what I&apos;m trying to say here).</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3>george zelenz &#x3C;ploo@mindspring.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/26/1999 12:56:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;and I might consider an ebow  for melodic playing.<br/>&gt;I believe Nguyen Le may play fretless ebow guitar<br/>&gt;on some of his recordings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Bob Valentine<br/>&gt;<br/>He does indeed.

Make it a baritone guitar! Tune it down a fourth and use<br/>heavier gauge strings.<br/>2. Increase the scale length a couple of inches, and again<br/>use heavier strings.<br/>3. Just use heavier strings. On a fretless, you will not be<br/>bending anyway.<br/>4. Treat the fingerboard with superglue.<br/>5. Treat the fingerboard with an epoxy-alcohol (wood or pure<br/>grain) mixture. The alcohol thins it down for greater<br/>penetration. Use many coats, and use a high grade epoxy.<br/>This is my favorite. You have lots of control, and you can<br/>vary the viscosity from 30-70 for the beginning of the job<br/>to 70-30 as the coat builds up. Put on several coats a day<br/>and give it a couple weeks to cure before sanding and<br/>polishing. Use automotive sanding plane ($10-$20 at an auto<br/>paint store) to sand and automotive polish (like Maguiar&apos;s)<br/>to polish. I have done this a lot on fretlesses, and it<br/>helps.<br/>6. Play in really strong winds for that Aeolian harp<br/>effect;)<br/>7. Switch to bass.

It&apos;s really quite wonderful.<br/>I knew that it would sound good, however, it sounds even better than I<br/>could&apos;ve imagined. It has aspects of a fretless bass, oud and sarod, all in<br/>one. I can hardly wait to dig out all the saved posts with various scales to<br/>try out on this instrument.

The OM is a smaller bodied guitar,<br/>like a 000, main difference is a wider neck than standard, 1 + 3/4 inches at<br/>the nut. It&apos;s what I am used to on my other guitars. It also has scalloped<br/>bracing. It&apos;s an amazing little guitar for the money, I was never a big<br/>Martin fan, except for a friends&apos; vintage 1930s 000-28.
