Pehrson</p><p>Joseph,</p><p>By all means let your ear take precedence over any theory as you go<br/>through the creative process!</p><p>Here&apos;s another surprise: Remember a year ago that I said that your<br/>Blackjack trombone piece had inspired me to want to start composing?<br/>Well, now that the notation development project is nearing<br/>completion, I&apos;m finally getting around to it.  I just started a<br/>composition a couple of weeks ago in my 17-tone well temperament,<br/>using a 9-tone MOS scale subset as an organizing principle.  I had<br/>worked out the underlying theory behind it in 1978 and taped a short<br/>improvisation on the Scalatron using it.  My new piece is based on an<br/>idea from that improvisation, and the experience of hearing it played<br/>in real time (from a midi file) as I work on it is something new,<br/>exciting, and fun (and, yes, liberating!) for me.  (If only I&apos;d had<br/>this in the 70&apos;s.)</p><p>But I don&apos;t compose at the computer -- I discover things and develop<br/>them at the Scalatron keyboard, just like I did back then.  The<br/>theory serves as a starting point or frame of reference, but my ear<br/>is the judge of where I go from there -- of what works and what<br/>doesn&apos;t, of what is good and what might be better.  And how wonderful<br/>it is to come up with an effective chord progression that very likely<br/>no one has ever heard before!  (What&apos;s a magic chord, anyway?<br/>Something you pull out of a hat?)</p><p>So I&apos;m delighted to hear that you&apos;re experiencing some of the same<br/>feelings as I am now that you&apos;re in the process of<br/>becoming &quot;liberated.&quot;</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=41832 href="#41832">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E; &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/9/2003 2:19:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt;&quot;</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_41828.html#41831">/tuning/topicId_41828.html#41831</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By all means let your ear take precedence over any theory as you go<br/>&gt; through the creative process!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s another surprise: Remember a year ago that I said that your<br/>&gt; Blackjack trombone piece had inspired me to want to start<br/>composing?
