It works great in<br/>Sibelius.</p><p>And, to use *symbols* before your pitches, it&apos;s easy to add them in<br/>Sibelius.  I would suggest using Ted Mook&apos;s special font, which he<br/>has designed for this purpose.  It&apos;s a PostScript font and works just<br/>great in Sibelius:</p><p><a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~tmook/micro.html">http://www.mindspring.com/~tmook/micro.html</a></p><p>Don&apos;t forget, if you&apos;re using an IBM to install &quot;Adobe Type Manager<br/>Light&quot; in order to get the PostScript font to work:</p><p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/atmlight/main.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/atmlight/main.html</a></p><p>The font works for the Mac, too.  I don&apos;t know the exact procedure,<br/>but it can&apos;t be difficult.</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3>orangedoor190 &#x3C;orangedoor190@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2002 9:34:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; ***Hey Kyle!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nice to see you on here again.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, you can use your *regular* 12-equal keyboard, if you so<br/>&gt; desire, since I know you are a user of Sibelius!<br/>&gt; All you need to do is to enter in *pitch bends* above the notes, and<br/>&gt; Sibelius will do all the rest for you in making 72-tET, so the basic<br/>&gt; pitches are your 12-equal pitches.</p><p>Thanks, Joe, I&apos;ll try it.

Frank Oteri of the<br/>American Music Center is *also* tring to input a microtonal opera<br/>into Sibelius!...</p><p>The bend range for each 12-tET pitch in Sibelus is 400 cents, 2<br/>semitones in each direction.</p><p>The finest resolution of the MIDI spec is 128x128.  The first number<br/>of the bend command is the &quot;fine&quot; resolution from 1-128 and the<br/>second number (furthest to the right) is the &quot;coarse&quot; definition 1-<br/>128.  So the definition is 16384 bend units per 400 cents.</p><p>That comes out to .0244 cents resolution.</p><p>Although some on this particular list claim they can hear that, it<br/>exceeds my *own* abilities...</p><p>[That was a joke]</p><p>The pitch bends, as I mentioned, can be entered directly above the<br/>notes in Sibelius -- I, personally, feel that&apos;s the easiest way to<br/>keep track of things -- but some people have tried to &quot;streamline&quot;<br/>this procedure.</p><p>A fellow by the name of Pete Walton has created a<br/>microtonal &quot;temperaments plug-in&quot; for Sibelius.  Basically, it<br/>automatically assigns pitch bends to various &quot;default&quot; accidentals in<br/>Sibelius (sharps, flats, double sharps, double flats, and quartertone<br/>sharps and flats-- there are 9 possibilities in all for each &quot;note<br/>name&quot;)</p><p>So, a person could simply enter in &quot;regular&quot; accidentals to pitches<br/>and the temperaments plug-in could do all the rest, if you care to go<br/>that route.</p><p>One has to keep track of things, to know what symbol means what, but<br/>it could work for some people.</p><p>I can give you his address privately via e-mail or on the Sibelius<br/>chat list if you are interested in experimenting with this as well.</p><p>Sibelius *does* need more work for a fuller microtonal<br/>implementation, but there *are* some people developing their<br/>own &quot;workarounds...&quot;</p><p>best,</p><p>Joe</p></div>
