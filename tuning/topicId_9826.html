For example, when a ratio like 405:256 arises in a just tuning<br/>(say, an extended sruti system), it has nothing to do with hearing the 405th<br/>harmonic directly. Likewise, in tunings like La Monte Young&apos;s sine wave<br/>complexes, very large primes are useful only because combination tones (and<br/>perhaps periodicity) formed with other large primes reinforce a common<br/>fundamental, an effect which would be impossible if these primes defined<br/>lattice axes on which multiple ratios appeared.</p><p>&gt;What is harmful to<br/>&gt;a musician in learning more than one way of describing a collection of<br/>&gt;tones?</p><p>Nothing at all; however, when the mathematics used is not perceptually<br/>relevant, we are in danger of both creating music divorced from sonic<br/>reality, and of scaring away musicians with too much mathematics (I know, I<br/>should talk . . . :).</p></div>
