When a singer sings a rich<br/>musical<br/>&gt; tone, or even a bassoonist plays a juicy and rich note, it is really<br/>&gt; the overtone series at work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See, if the harmonics of a string, or of a bassoon, are lined up to<br/>&gt; bring out their sound, you will have all the superparticular ratios<br/>&gt; represented in the note itself.<br/>[snip]</p><p>There is another explanation that is, in a way, just another wording<br/>of Johnny&apos;s explanation, using harmonic entropy. First, we should note<br/>that the octave is &quot;stricto sensu&quot; the simplest superparticular ratio.</p><p>Then we may ask the question; how is it possible to divide a<br/>superparticular ratio in order to introduce two new ratio with the<br/>smallest harmonic entropy wrt the two existing degrees? I think we can<br/>rephrase this by replacing &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;, by &quot;highest<br/>consonnance&quot; or &quot;maximum number of common partials&quot; but I am a little<br/>affraid to trigger another holy war on the NG ;-).</p><p>The answer is starting from N:N+1 we get 2N:2N+1:2N+2; i.e. stacking<br/>two superparticular ratio to interleave a new degree between initial<br/>ratio. Try to find simpler, it is not possible (as far as I can<br/>conjecture, even tough I cannot provide a formal proof). So we have a<br/>process of &quot;superparticular split&quot; that may had a role in derivation<br/>of scale in various tradition.</p><p>1:2 -&gt; 2:3:4 fifth and fourth from octave<br/>2:3 -&gt; 4:5:6 major third and minor third from fifth<br/>3:4 -&gt; 6:7:8 &quot;pygmea&quot; thirds from fourth<br/>4:5 -&gt; 8:9:10 major and minor second from major third</p><p>That raises a few question like:</p><p>Why the division of the fourth 6:7:8 is is not used in western<br/>tradition?<br/>why the minor third is divided 40:45:48 and not simply 10:11:12?</p><p>The answer is probably something like: because of the need to build a<br/>scale with a great number of usable simple ratio from a limited (7)<br/>number of degrees. Certainly other people are more historicaly<br/>informed to provide better answers to those questions (Paul? Margo?).</p><p>Peculiarly, the diatonic semitone 15:16 seems to arise from the<br/>superparticular split of the interval 7:8 that is not used in western<br/>tradition.</p><p>I read somewhere that 6:7:8 is one of the basis of the magnificent<br/>pygmea Aka polyphonies. Is it used in other musical cultures?</p><p>Yours truly</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re</p></div>
