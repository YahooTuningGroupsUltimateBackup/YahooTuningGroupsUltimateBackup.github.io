As has<br/>been pointed out in Ben Johnston&apos;s notation, the basic notes used could<br/>easily correspond to JI.</p><p>Also interesting is how many bits there are in Bitter Music that connect to<br/>other Partch pieces, including USHighball, Barstow, My Heart Keeps Beating<br/>Time, Mendota Night, A Dream (from the Li Po), and probably others.</p><p>And thirdly, I have fashioned a score made up exclusively of notated<br/>music...little to no straight talking.  No concert planned yet, but it will<br/>be on the burner.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2001 1:09:50 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/21318">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/21318</a></p><p>&gt; Also interesting is how many bits there are in Bitter Music<br/>&gt; that connect to other Partch pieces, including US Highball,<br/>&gt; Barstow, My Heart Keeps Beating Time, Mendota Night, A Dream<br/>&gt; (from the Li Po), and probably others.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting to me that (AFAIK) no-one has ever pointed<br/>out the strong resemblance between the opening vocal phrase<br/>of _My Heart Keeps Beating Time_ and the section of _Barstow_<br/>(in the later version with Kithara, Boo, Diamond Marimba, and<br/>Chromelodeon) where the voice says &quot;I&apos;m on my way... one half<br/>of desert to the east&quot;.
