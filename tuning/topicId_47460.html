From your<br/>letters, it seems that the Feitein method has nothing to do with well<br/>temperament, but is a compensatory means of achieving equal<br/>temperament on the guitar (correct me if I&apos;m wrong). This explains<br/>why studio players I know find it a joy to be in tune with keyboards,<br/>up and down the neck. Then this recommended tuning (with compensated<br/>nut):</p><p>Electric Guitar<br/>(Preferred Embodiment)<br/>Note  Open (Cents)     l2th Fret<br/>E(1)     00              00<br/>B        +0              00<br/>G       -02             +01<br/>D       -02             +01<br/>A       -02              00<br/>E(6)    -02              00</p><p>puts the guitar into better equal temperament. (What happens when<br/>some strings are fretted, while others are not? Take a D chord,<br/>strings 1,2,3, played on 2nd and 3rd frets, with strings 4,5 open.<br/>SWouldn&apos;t this chord, played across 5 strings, sound odd?)</p><p>I don&apos;t want to be in the position of defending Feiten. From your<br/>indications, much hard work (mathematical and otherwise) has been<br/>done and made available in the public domain; these sources seem<br/>uncredited. It is a more proper solution to design a nut compensated<br/>for each string. (There is a patent: 6,433,264 Gimpel and Lindhauer,<br/>August, 2002).</p><p>I will say that Feiten has created a workable solution, easily<br/>implemented by the dedicated guitar tech, worldwide (and makers),<br/>that imho is a definitive improvement. I realize from reading your<br/>comments that Feiten&apos;s system is a compromise; it may be this aspect<br/>of compromise that could allow it to flourish, it&apos;s too early to say.<br/>Frankly, it remains appreciated by a small percent of players, and<br/>tuning by ear becomes impossible (I can&apos;t hear -2 cents)--you need to<br/>buy the Korg DT7 tuner, which has a &quot;Feiten&quot; mode. Without an<br/>available tuner, the system is dead, pragmatically. I should mention<br/>that it&apos;s possible to tune by ear to chords, but it takes time. I<br/>don&apos;t know Feiten. He&apos;s recorded with a number of legendary musicians<br/>over his career. Watching his &quot;Retrofitters&quot; DVD, I feel his passion<br/>for getting the guitar to produce a sweet, singing sustain, in (equal<br/>tempered) tune. The mystique is anathema to me though. In fairness,<br/>for the non-professional, any discussion of temprament is obtuse and<br/>potentially off-putting--unless you take a course.</p><p>In the DVD, Feiten mentions Verckmeister and well temperament-- who<br/>may have inspired him, but the mention of well temperament is<br/>misleading.</p><p>I don&apos;t see exactly why the above tuning embodiment is (relatively)<br/>effective, across 6 strings and up and down the neck, in whatever<br/>key. That is, why the nut compensation+tuning has created a closer<br/>equal temperament, no doubt needing a deeper mathematical knowledge<br/>in order to comprehend more precisely.</p><p>Thanks you,<br/>R. Gilbert</p><p>&gt; aaron, you are correct. the primary advantage of feiten&apos;s system is<br/>&gt; that it corrects the usual tendency of the lower frets to sound<br/>&gt; sharp, due to the additional tension needed to bend the strings<br/>down<br/>&gt; to the frets in that position. this adjustment has been a godsend<br/>for<br/>&gt; certain instrumentalists -- for example stu hamm (electric bassist)<br/>&gt; said his 1st fret notes were 9 cents sharp before the adjustment --<br/>&gt; but the result is simply a much more accurate rendition of 12-equal<br/>&gt; (with a touch of octave stretch). great for modern studio settings<br/>&gt; with pianos, synths, etc. but the relationship with<br/>historical &quot;well-<br/>&gt; tempering&quot; schemes is nil, and much of the marketing buzz (no pun<br/>&gt; intended) around this is pure tripe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; the &quot;compensated nut&quot; is not a new idea. hopefully it&apos;s possible to<br/>&gt; have this done without infringing buzz&apos;s patent. for getting<br/>accurate<br/>&gt; microtonal tunings on a steel-string acoustic guitar or electric<br/>&gt; bass, if the frets are placed according to &quot;naive&quot; string length<br/>&gt; calculations (as they almost always are), a compensated nut (and of<br/>&gt; course adjustable bridge saddles) would seem to be essential. or<br/>you<br/>&gt; can go dante rosati&apos;s route and place the fretlets individually for<br/>&gt; each string:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://users.rcn.com/dante.interport/justguitar.html">http://users.rcn.com/dante.interport/justguitar.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;backfromthesilo&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;backfromthesilo@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Feitenization cannot be as much as they kinda imply that it is.<br/>It<br/>&gt; &gt; is easy to think about and understand that there is simply no way<br/>&gt; &gt; to get a consistent temperament using only the changes he&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; made.

It&apos;s all there pretty much.  I&apos;m not saying the Feiten<br/>should give all the details of temperament in all his literature, but<br/>it is obvious that he has intentionally misled the public about the<br/>effects of his tuning.  It is a combination of a real concept with<br/>lots of dishonest, vague marketing.  It is almost as if Feiten tries<br/>his hardest to convince normal people that tuning is too<br/>complicated to understand.  He&apos;d rather people give up and not<br/>try to understand, otherwise they might see that his innovation is<br/>not so incredibly groundbreaking.  He says to the average<br/>customer &quot;you don&apos;t want to really think about these things, it&apos;s<br/>complicated, just TRUST ME&quot; and then charges $hundreds for a<br/>modification that shouldn&apos;t be so expensive (but I&apos;ll agree is<br/>worthwhile).</p><p>As for the tuning issue, if you have a decent ear, you can get rid<br/>of your korg tuner.  Feiten even makes it clear how to tune<br/>without a tuner.  It&apos;s simple.  I don&apos;t know his exact system, but as<br/>long as you don&apos;t tune OPEN strings, but instead (after one string<br/>is in tune) tune fretted notes to other fretted notes, you&apos;ll basically<br/>be fine.  He does have an exact recommendation of which notes<br/>to tune, and it isn&apos;t really more difficult than traditional tuning<br/>methods.  But if this were emphasized they wouldn&apos;t sell as<br/>many tuners and Feiten wouldn&apos;t get his licensing share on<br/>those too.</p><p>Aaron</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dynamicmonk&quot; &lt;gilbert@i...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Paul, Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for your comments and the informative links.

(There is a patent: 6,433,264 Gimpel and<br/>Lindhauer,<br/>&gt; August, 2002).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I will say that Feiten has created a workable solution, easily<br/>&gt; implemented by the dedicated guitar tech, worldwide (and<br/>makers),<br/>&gt; that imho is a definitive improvement. I realize from reading<br/>your<br/>&gt; comments that Feiten&apos;s system is a compromise; it may be<br/>this aspect<br/>&gt; of compromise that could allow it to flourish, it&apos;s too early to<br/>say.<br/>&gt; Frankly, it remains appreciated by a small percent of players,<br/>and<br/>&gt; tuning by ear becomes impossible (I can&apos;t hear -2 cents)--you<br/>need to<br/>&gt; buy the Korg DT7 tuner, which has a &quot;Feiten&quot; mode. Without an<br/>&gt; available tuner, the system is dead, pragmatically. I should<br/>mention<br/>&gt; that it&apos;s possible to tune by ear to chords, but it takes time. I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t know Feiten. He&apos;s recorded with a number of legendary<br/>musicians<br/>&gt; over his career. Watching his &quot;Retrofitters&quot; DVD, I feel his<br/>passion<br/>&gt; for getting the guitar to produce a sweet, singing sustain, in<br/>(equal<br/>&gt; tempered) tune. The mystique is anathema to me though. In<br/>fairness,<br/>&gt; for the non-professional, any discussion of temprament is<br/>obtuse and<br/>&gt; potentially off-putting--unless you take a course.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the DVD, Feiten mentions Verckmeister and well<br/>temperament-- who<br/>&gt; may have inspired him, but the mention of well temperament is<br/>&gt; misleading.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see exactly why the above tuning embodiment is<br/>(relatively)<br/>&gt; effective, across 6 strings and up and down the neck, in<br/>whatever<br/>&gt; key. That is, why the nut compensation+tuning has created a<br/>closer<br/>&gt; equal temperament, no doubt needing a deeper mathematical<br/>knowledge<br/>&gt; in order to comprehend more precisely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks you,<br/>&gt; R. Gilbert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; aaron, you are correct. the primary advantage of feiten&apos;s<br/>system is<br/>&gt; &gt; that it corrects the usual tendency of the lower frets to sound<br/>&gt; &gt; sharp, due to the additional tension needed to bend the<br/>strings<br/>&gt; down<br/>&gt; &gt; to the frets in that position. this adjustment has been a<br/>godsend<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; certain instrumentalists -- for example stu hamm (electric<br/>bassist)<br/>&gt; &gt; said his 1st fret notes were 9 cents sharp before the<br/>adjustment --<br/>&gt; &gt; but the result is simply a much more accurate rendition of<br/>12-equal<br/>&gt; &gt; (with a touch of octave stretch). great for modern studio<br/>settings<br/>&gt; &gt; with pianos, synths, etc. but the relationship with<br/>&gt; historical &quot;well-<br/>&gt; &gt; tempering&quot; schemes is nil, and much of the marketing buzz<br/>(no pun<br/>&gt; &gt; intended) around this is pure tripe.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the &quot;compensated nut&quot; is not a new idea. hopefully it&apos;s<br/>possible to<br/>&gt; &gt; have this done without infringing buzz&apos;s patent. for getting<br/>&gt; accurate<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonal tunings on a steel-string acoustic guitar or electric<br/>&gt; &gt; bass, if the frets are placed according to &quot;naive&quot; string length<br/>&gt; &gt; calculations (as they almost always are), a compensated nut<br/>(and of<br/>&gt; &gt; course adjustable bridge saddles) would seem to be<br/>essential. or<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; can go dante rosati&apos;s route and place the fretlets individually<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; each string:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://users.rcn.com/dante.interport/justguitar.html">http://users.rcn.com/dante.interport/justguitar.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;backfromthesilo&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;backfromthesilo@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Feitenization cannot be as much as they kinda imply that it<br/>is.<br/>&gt; It<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is easy to think about and understand that there is simply<br/>no way<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to get a consistent temperament using only the changes<br/>he&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; made.

You<br/>can generalize this equation by replacing X sub zero with &quot;a&quot; and<br/>add &quot;b&quot; at the end: &quot;X sub n equals a times 2 to the minus n over 12<br/>power plus b&quot;. In this form, which I have called the cannonical form<br/>of the equation for fret placement, if b equals 0 you are left with<br/>the first equation given above. When b has a positive value, it<br/>represents saddle setback from the nominal position. &quot;a&quot; equals scale<br/>length. With the help of this equation we can optimize nut and saddle<br/>positions. The trick is to use statistical methods to find the equal-<br/>tempered set of fret placements that most precisely matches our<br/>experimentally determined set.&quot;</p><p>I found challenging. I hope you will allow this lacuna in your<br/>inevitable logic.

It&apos;s all there pretty much.  I&apos;m not saying the<br/>Feiten<br/>&gt; should give all the details of temperament in all his literature,<br/>but<br/>&gt; it is obvious that he has intentionally misled the public about the<br/>&gt; effects of his tuning.  It is a combination of a real concept with<br/>&gt; lots of dishonest, vague marketing.  It is almost as if Feiten<br/>tries<br/>&gt; his hardest to convince normal people that tuning is too<br/>&gt; complicated to understand.  He&apos;d rather people give up and not<br/>&gt; try to understand, otherwise they might see that his innovation is<br/>&gt; not so incredibly groundbreaking.  He says to the average<br/>&gt; customer &quot;you don&apos;t want to really think about these things, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; complicated, just TRUST ME&quot; and then charges $hundreds for a<br/>&gt; modification that shouldn&apos;t be so expensive (but I&apos;ll agree is<br/>&gt; worthwhile).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for the tuning issue, if you have a decent ear, you can get rid<br/>&gt; of your korg tuner.  Feiten even makes it clear how to tune<br/>&gt; without a tuner.  It&apos;s simple.  I don&apos;t know his exact system, but<br/>as<br/>&gt; long as you don&apos;t tune OPEN strings, but instead (after one string<br/>&gt; is in tune) tune fretted notes to other fretted notes, you&apos;ll<br/>basically<br/>&gt; be fine.  He does have an exact recommendation of which notes<br/>&gt; to tune, and it isn&apos;t really more difficult than traditional tuning<br/>&gt; methods.  But if this were emphasized they wouldn&apos;t sell as<br/>&gt; many tuners and Feiten wouldn&apos;t get his licensing share on<br/>&gt; those too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2003 1:44:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dynamicmonk&quot; &lt;gilbert@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see exactly why the above tuning embodiment is (relatively)<br/>&gt; effective, across 6 strings and up and down the neck, in whatever<br/>&gt; key.

I am wondering if it has to do with the difference<br/>&gt; between wound and unwound strings.</p><p>yes, wound strings have a greater degree of inharmonicitity, so it<br/>would make sense to stretch their octaves more.</p><p>&gt; That is, the (thicker, more<br/>&gt; tensioned) D and G are &quot;compensated&quot; to be in equal temperament<br/>with<br/>&gt; especially the (unwound) B?</p><p>the nut compensation can only acheive so much in the way of<br/>correction. these additional offsets may have to do with taming<br/>inharmonicity by stretching the lower octaves, or they may simply<br/>allow one to approximate equal temperament even more closely over the<br/>whole neck than the nut compensation alone would accomplish. i<br/>haven&apos;t read the document closely or recently enough to say for sure.</p></div>
