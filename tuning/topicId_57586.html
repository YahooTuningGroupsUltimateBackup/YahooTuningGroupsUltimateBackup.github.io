The Moors were already well-established in Iberia in the mid-9th century, though, so there could have been an exchange of ideas.</p><p>&gt; but my article is on the *fretting* of the Arab Lute,<br/>&gt; and you say that what i wrote about is fretless?  ... ?</p><p>We may be talking about different instruments. The oud is usually fretless (long-necked lutes such as the tanbur, saz, baglama, buzuq, tar and setar have moveable frets); the Europeans added tied frets to their version of the lute. Music theorists might have added frets to the oud for demonstration purposes, but to have frets on and oud or violin during performances is comparable to Lance Armstrong running the Tour de France on a bike with training wheels.</p><p>~Danny~</p></div><h3><a id=57629 href="#57629">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2005 4:50:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Danny,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Daniel A.

Dastg&acirc;h-e Seg&acirc;h repeats every fourth: C D Ep F<br/>&gt; G Ap Bb C Dp Eb etc., and I think Panjg&acirc;h (F G A Bb C D Eb F)<br/>&gt; might as well, or it could merely be what the West calls<br/>&gt; Mixolydian mode. Chah&acirc;rg&acirc;h might be a pentachordal or<br/>&gt; repeating-fifth scale, but I&apos;m not sure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i&apos;ve done some research on the medieval Frankish treatise<br/>&gt; &gt; _musica enchiriadis_, and am convinced that the scale<br/>&gt; &gt; given in the unique &quot;daseian&quot; notation is based on<br/>&gt; &gt; all-conjunct tetrachords, which is *not* the accepted<br/>&gt; &gt; interpretation.  see my page about it, especially the<br/>&gt; &gt; part at the bottom:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/daseian.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/daseian.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i&apos;ve long thought that the Franks got some of their<br/>&gt; &gt; music theory ideas from the Byzantine Empire and its<br/>&gt; &gt; Muslim neighbors.  hmm ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was thinking it might have been because of the Crusades,<br/>&gt; but the Enchiriadis was written a good two centures before<br/>&gt; the First Crusade.

I&apos;m interested in this too, especially<br/>the role Charlemagne apparently played in trying to homogenize<br/>the chant as it existed in the Frankish empire. The bits<br/>I&apos;ve read about the rustic &quot;vulgarities&quot; in the chant in<br/>local Frankish churches during that time are tantalizing.<br/>Based on my studies of the _musica enchiriadis_, I think<br/>that chant may have had a 5-limit basis, perhaps even 7.</p><p>It was Charlemagne&apos;s goal to eliminate this vagaries, so<br/>I wonder what the rustic chant was really like, and I&apos;ve<br/>often thought that Byzantine chant probably holds part of<br/>the answer, but I&apos;ve never looked into it seriously.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/30507">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/30507</a></p><p>&quot;as far back as the late 700s, Charlemagne had close diplomatic<br/>ties with the Baghdad Caliphate&quot;.</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/8315">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/8315</a></p><p>&quot;Charlemagne (c 750-800), who had good diplomatic ties with the<br/>Byzantine (i.e., Greek) Empire, Persia, and the Baghdad Caliphate,<br/>and who knew how important education was, began to bring some<br/>of the Greek learning back into Europe - some of it filtered<br/>thru the Arab scholars.&quot;</p><p>here&apos;s a fairly detailed article about the dissemination<br/>of Muslim musical culture into Europe during medieval times:</p><p><a href="http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=404">http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=404</a></p><p>i can relate an anecdote of interest here: when i was in<br/>Italy in 2001, i attended a concert by a group performing<br/>12th/13th-century troubadour music, on period instruments.<br/>one piece was lute solo from Occitan (southern France)<br/>that sounded *exactly* like a folk piece from Morocco on<br/>a CD i had. the influence was clear. (BTW, this concert took<br/>place in the great hall of a palace built in the 1200s.)</p><p>one other thing i should note: most scholars believe<br/>that the _enchiriadis_ treatises were written in the<br/>later 900s, but i feel fairly strongly that they are at<br/>least a century older.</p><p>the only cogent argument against my early dating is that<br/>the daseian notation of _enchiriadis_ seems to be a<br/>simplification of the notation system presented by Hucbald,<br/>who lived 840-930, in his treatise _de harmonica institutione_.<br/>apparently this is an early work by him ... list member<br/>Margo Schulter cites it as c.880 here:</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex1.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex1.html</a></p><p>some scholars believe that he also wrote the<br/>_enchiriadis_ treatises, later in life.  see:</p><p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07510b.htm">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07510b.htm</a></p><p>in fact, one or both of the _enchiriadis_ treatises were<br/>long attributed to Hucbald, but then he was discredited,<br/>which is how it stood when i did most of my research on<br/>this period in music theory. now apparently he&apos;s back in.</p><p>anyway, there was a lot more research i wanted to do<br/>on both _enchiriadis_ and Hucbald, but never got around<br/>to it ...</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=57895 href="#57895">ðŸ”—</a>ertugrulinanc &#x3C;ertugrulinanc@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/7/2005 3:30:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello folks,</p><p>Sorry for bumping up an old thread.
