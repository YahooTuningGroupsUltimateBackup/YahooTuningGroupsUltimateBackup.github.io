I *did* notice I had a Timidity table in the same<br/>directory, set up for golden-meantone; perhaps I made different<br/>versions and then mislabelled one?---I was trying different tunings<br/>out for the music--maybe I goofed---but it appears you are correct!<br/>Congrats on noticing this, and my apologies for inadvertently<br/>mis-leading the public!

Of course, for that to make any difference you need<br/>to actually use its septimal values. 45-et is effectively the same<br/>thing as 2/5-comma, tuningwise. The tuning for 7/6 is excellent, and<br/>minor thirds are good, and sharp rather than flat, so that 7/6 and 6/5<br/>are in no danger of being confused. The flattone fifth, lying to the<br/>south of the 19-et fifth, seems like it might be too flat to pass<br/>muster but in practice it seems to work out. It&apos;s under my 9-cent<br/>limit, at any rate.</p></div><h3><a id=69874 href="#69874">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/18/2007 3:17:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not finding it there at all.
