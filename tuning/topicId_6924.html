I have used<br/>&gt;&gt;it occasionally for performances. However, I do have an FB-01 that Dudley<br/>&gt;&gt;Duncan asked me to find a home for, preferably with people who are going to<br/>&gt;&gt;be using it for its tuning capabilities. I don&apos;t know if you know the<br/>&gt;&gt;FB-01, but it&apos;s very similar to the 81Z. Unfortunately, the tuning has to<br/>&gt;&gt;be done entirely through MIDI sysex -- it can&apos;t be accessed via the front<br/>&gt;&gt;panel. Let me know if the SEJIS would make good use of it and I&apos;ll send it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;An FB-01!  Jules Siegel claimed it had a quirk which allowed it to accept<br/>&gt;multiple (different) pitch bends on the same channel.  Does anybody know<br/>&gt;anything about that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;-Carl<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;You do not need web access to participate.  You may subscribe through<br/>&gt;email.
