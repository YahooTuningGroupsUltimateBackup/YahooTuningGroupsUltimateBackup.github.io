Robert Toft&apos;s<br/>book which I cite in the above Web page shows how the evidence of<br/>tablatures for instruments such as lute confirms that a lot of this was<br/>indeed a matter of discretion with two or three solutions possible.</p><p>Nicola Vicentino tells us also that sometimes singers got their signals<br/>mixed, with things like expected &quot;dissonant sevenths&quot; (read augmented<br/>sixths) resulting. Let&apos;s suppose that we have a sixth E3-C4 before D3-D4,<br/>so that _someone_ should be inflecting to make that sixth major, assuming<br/>that we want to follow &quot;closest approach&quot; (a routine but not invariable<br/>thing).</p><p>This is a bit like one of those &quot;Prisoner&apos;s Dilemma&quot; games: if _either_<br/>the lower singer sings Eb (a _fa_ inflection), or the upper one sings C#<br/>(a _mi_ inflection), we get a major sixth. If neither inflects, we get  a<br/>minor sixth before an octave -- routine in some styles or places, but<br/>considered awkward by others. If _both_ make their inflections, then we<br/>get Eb3-C#4, the &quot;seventh&quot; which Vicentino warns singers and composers<br/>about. (Yes, it can occur deliberately, but that&apos;s another question.)</p><p>The practice of supplying accidentals at cadences which might not be<br/>written in the manuscript, a feature of 14th-16th century practice, can<br/>draw on various cues: what one&apos;s own voice is doing (if one is a singer or<br/>player of a melody instrument), the vertical context (unfolding in real<br/>time, to complicate things considerably), and in a Renaissance setting,<br/>often the vital clue of a suspension leading one to feel, &quot;Here comes a<br/>cadence (probably)!&quot;</p><p>Of course, as Aaron and others note, rehearsing, finding any pitfalls, and<br/>ironing them out is one solution -- but getting it &quot;right&quot; the first time<br/>(or in one of the umpteen possible interpretations that seems a _version_<br/>of &quot;right&quot;) can be a problematic thing.</p><p>As for the sizes of the semitones, I suspect that they would approximately<br/>fit a Pythagorean model in 13th-14th century music (the rule of &quot;closest<br/>approach&quot; getting formulated around 1300-1320, but with manuscript<br/>accidentals suggesting some tendencies in this direction near the end of<br/>the 13th century), and some kind of meantone/3-5 JI model starting around<br/>1500 or a bit earlier.</p><p>A Pythagorean model means small diatonic semitones (nicely fitting the<br/>active cadential thirds and sixths); a meantone/3-5 JI model means rather<br/>large semitones, and an ideal of smooth thirds and sixths, for example in<br/>resolving cadential suspensions.</p><p>Some theorists give rough guidelines in terms of fractions of a tone. One<br/>15th-century theorist says that the Pythagorean semitones are about 4/9<br/>and 5/9 tone for diatonic and chromatic respectively (quite accurate,<br/>since these fractions precisely occur in the almost identical 53-tET!),<br/>while Renaissance writers, once the transition from the old model to the<br/>new gets codified, give converse fractions like 5/9 or 3/5 tone for the<br/>large _diatonic_ semitone of this new model.</p><p>The late 15th-century provokes lots of debate, and some people say, &quot;Even<br/>if the organs were in meantone, I suspect that singers would often still<br/>have used something like Pythagorean for at least portions of Ockeghem or<br/>Josquin.&quot; It can be a &quot;hot button&quot; issue among performance practice<br/>scholars and critics.</p><p>Anyway, as someone who sometimes asks &quot;Should I play this note as C#, Db,<br/>or just plain C?&quot; (in an early 15th-century Pythagorean setting), I<br/>suspect that performers reached lots of different solutions, and that the<br/>different accidentals coming down to us in different versions of the same<br/>piece may indicate that performers were a diverse lot also.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=19915 href="#19915">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/7/2001 7:07:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.
