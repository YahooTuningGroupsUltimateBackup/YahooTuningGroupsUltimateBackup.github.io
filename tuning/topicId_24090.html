        <a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Item: The Scale Tree</h1><h3><a id=24090 href="#24090">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@matavnet.hu&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2001 7:37:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Item: The Scale Tree is useful in real music as made by real musicians.</p><p>Each location on the scale tree shows two pieces of information: a number of<br/>tones in the scale as the sum of the number of members in two  scales with fewer<br/>tones, and a number indicating the size of the generating interval of the scale,<br/>relative to an interval of repetition (typically, but not necessarily, an<br/>octave).</p><p>A given number of scale tones will appear on the tree in every relatively-prime<br/>set of sums. For example, one finds scales with 12 tones as the sum of 1+11 and<br/>5+7. (The non-relatively-prime sums, 2+10=12, 3+9=12, and 4+8=12, generate<br/>deficient and redundant solutions, so we can ignore them). This is useful<br/>because a given scale&apos;s appearance in different places on the tree indicates<br/>different -- and often surprisingly so -- ways of working.</p><p>For example, I can make a piece of music based upon a set of five fifths or<br/>fourths in 12tet, and then make a variation based on mapping that same music<br/>onto a series of minor seconds or Major sevenths (that&apos;s the M5 transformation<br/>that some twelve-toners get excited about). I won&apos;t make the claim that the<br/>relationship between the original piece of music and the variation will be<br/>immediately or ever apparent to a listener (although one could well come up with<br/>a compositional strategy to do so), but simply that the piece and its variation<br/>will share a structure for consuming pitch classes.</p><p>Now the numbers associated with each scale positioned on the tree and indicating<br/>the size of the generating interval for that scale can also work if they are<br/>considered to be a bit fuzzy.  Don&apos;t worry -- I don&apos;t know anything about fuzzy<br/>math, but neither does the Resident of the U.S., I just want to indicate that<br/>the many of the properties the scale tree associates with a given generator also<br/>apply to scales with generators very close in size, or even to scales whose<br/>generators are not all of the same size, but average out to a size close to the<br/>generator in the scale tree. This is one way of thinking about &quot;constant<br/>structure&quot; (&quot;CS&quot; among the listfolk), through which I can find efficient ways to<br/>map non-equal tunings onto a keyboard or a notation derived from an equal<br/>temperament.</p><p>Now, here are some real-world examples of the scale tree at work: I had a<br/>rehearsal with my (central Javanese) gamelan group on Tuesday and we played a<br/>famous piece of 19th century Javanese music, the composition &quot;Pangkur&quot;, a<br/>ladrang (the form) based on a vocal melody in the slendro pathet (roughly: key)<br/>of Sanga. Part of the saron melody goes like this:</p><p>. 2 . 1  . 2 . 6   . 2 . 1  . 6 . 5<br/>6 6 . .  5 5 6 i   2 1 5 2  . 1 . 6</p><p>For our purposes here, we can think of slendro as 5tet (it&apos;s not really, but it<br/>shares a CS with 5tet), with a series of wide (3/5ths octave) fifths going 1 -<br/>5 - 2 - 6 - 3 - 1 (there&apos;s no number 4 in the notation, but don&apos;t worry about<br/>that).  So it&apos;s no big deal to imagine a simple transposition, up a tone, to<br/>slendro pathet manyura:</p><p>. 3 . 2  . 3 . 1   . 3 . 2  . i . 6<br/>i i . .  6 6 1 2   3 2 6 3  . 2 . 1</p><p>That&apos;s just like transposition in any other equal temperament -- I&apos;ve just added<br/>one to each number, or move two places to the right on the circle of slendro<br/>fifths.</p><p>But the Javanese also play &quot;Pangkur&quot; in their other tone system, Pelog,<br/>which is also built on a series of fifths, but fifths which average out to be<br/>about 5/9ths of an octave, smaller than the slendro fifths.</p><p>So we have this series of pelog fifths:</p><p>4 - 1 - 5 - 2 - 6 - 3 - 7</p><p>(This doesn&apos;t form a closed circle of fifths, but could if two extra tones were<br/>inserted, making a 9-tone tuning).</p><p>When I take my Pangkur melody in slendro, I simply map the tones following the<br/>series of fifths:</p><p>slendro:   3 - 1 - 5 - 2 - 6 - 3 - 1<br/>pelog:     4 - 1 - 5 - 2 - 6 - 3 - 7</p><p>Note that slendro 3 can be mapped to pelog 3 OR 4 and slendro 1 can be mapped<br/>onto either pelog 1 OR 7. In practice the mapping of a piece in slendro manyura<br/>is from sl.1 to pl.7 and sl.3 to pl.3 in pelog patet barang, and a piece in<br/>slendro pathet sanga is to pelog pathet lima or nem with sl.1 to pl.1 and the<br/>choice of 3 or 4 determined by conventions of tessitura and melodic contour.</p><p>So, direct mapping from pathet manyura gives me &quot;Pangkur&quot; in pelog pathet<br/>barang:</p><p>. 3 . 2  . 3 . 7   . 3 . 2  . 7 . 6<br/>7 7 . .  6 6 7 2   3 2 6 3  . 2 . 7</p><p>Or, from pathet sanga, I get &quot;Pangkur&quot; in pelog nem:</p><p>. 2 . 1  . 2 . 6   . 2 . 1  . 6 . 5<br/>6 6 . .  5 5 6 i   2 1 5 2  . 1 . 6</p><p>What does this have to do with the scale tree? Easy -- I&apos;ve just gone from<br/>subsets of a five tone scale based on a generating fifth of .6 octaves to<br/>subsets of a nine-tone scale based on a generating fifth of .66_ octave.  And I<br/>can guarantee that the relationship between the various versions of &quot;Pangkur&quot; is<br/>not difficult to hear.</p><p>The scale tree certainly isn&apos;t the only way to work with scales or to describe<br/>how scales may relate to one another, but it sure can be a useful and efficient<br/>way.</p><p>Tomorrow&apos;s item: &quot;Lattice diagrams can be useful in making real music.&quot;</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
