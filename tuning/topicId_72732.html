It seems that you thought i was being<br/>contentious, but that was never my intention. I was<br/>merely posting something else that i thought was a<br/>useful contribution to the subject.</p><p>I thought it was kind of weird that *you* fought against<br/>*my* ideas so strongly. Anyway, i&apos;m glad it didn&apos;t<br/>quite become a flame-war. Hopefully other readers will<br/>find both of our contributions useful for their own<br/>purposes.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=72735 href="#72735">ðŸ”—</a>mikal haley &#x3C;chipsterthehipster@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2007 9:51:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[ Attachment content not displayed ]</p></div><h3><a id=72745 href="#72745">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2007 8:01:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>monz wrote:<br/>&gt; I, for one, found your post with the Indian ratios<br/>&gt; most welcome.</p><p>I also thought it was useful. I was tempted to comment about the so-called &quot;srutal&quot; (aka &quot;diaschismic&quot;) temperament and how it (or rather, its corresponding Fokker periodicity block) seems to be a better fit than magic[22], with the exception of the three &quot;ati ati komal&quot; intervals, but I&apos;ve been super busy lately and haven&apos;t had a lot of free time to comment on anything. I was going to look around for a better periodicity block that includes the three extra intervals, but wasn&apos;t sure where to start.</p></div>
