The &quot;triad&quot; isn&apos;t even 1-<br/>&gt; 3-5 anymore?</p><p>Okay. I hadn&apos;t understood that. I&apos;ve only just done a fast first<br/>read through of the paper so far to get started thinking about<br/>the notation you use in it. Need to read it again more slowly again.</p><p>&gt; &gt; How do you notate the triad without the seventh if you<br/>&gt; &gt; use I for the seventh (ninth)?</p><p>&gt; Ino9.</p><p>Okay fine.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Can vii ever mean vii with a perfect fifth BTW? Or if you want<br/>&gt; &gt; to notate that, do you do viiaug5</p><p>&gt; You wouldn&apos;t, but there are actually two conflicing conventional<br/>&gt; methods of roman numeral analysis -- the &apos;popular&apos; and<br/>&gt; the &apos;classical&apos;. You&apos;re actually mixing the two, in that roman<br/>&gt; numerals are usually &apos;classical&apos;, but the rest of your symbols<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t. In classical terminology, I7 in the key of C major is C-E-G-<br/>&gt; B, it&apos;s not C-E-G-Bb. And so on. So classically, you&apos;d say vii#5 or<br/>&gt; viix5 or viiN5 (with a natural sign instead of the letter &quot;N&quot;),<br/>&gt; depending on the key, if you wanted vii with a perfect fifth. In<br/>&gt; popular terminology, roman numerals are not used, but in the key of C<br/>&gt; major, this chord would simply be called Bm.</p><p>Right. Okay, that&apos;s clear now, thanks, hadn&apos;t understood that.<br/>I&apos;ll fix that for the player so that it understands the roman numerals<br/>in the classical sense for seventh chords.</p><p>... - except, searching, I see that the roman numerals are often<br/>used in this mixed sense, maybe that is where I got it.<br/>e.g.<br/><a href="http://www.torvund.net/guitar/progressions/02-bluespro-1.asp">http://www.torvund.net/guitar/progressions/02-bluespro-1.asp</a></p><p>So probably I need to have to have a check box or radio button in the Gui<br/>to allow user to decide whether to use classical roman numerals<br/>notation or popular roman numberals.</p><p>In minor keys, presumably it is III in classical notation,<br/>for the IIIb which I think you would use in the popular mixed notation.</p><p>Then I read somewhere just now that you use VI for the major triad<br/>on the minor sixth, and VII for the major triad on the minor seventh,<br/>but vio and viio can be used for the diminished triads on the major<br/>sixth and sevenths in the minor scale (ascending mode).</p><p>Yes looking at my history folder, here:</p><p><a href="http://www.jcjc.cc.ms.us/faculty/finearts/jbrown/MUS1223/Study_Material/Unit04_Harmonic_Progression/Unit04_Harmonic_Progresson.html">http://www.jcjc.cc.ms.us/faculty/finearts/jbrown/MUS1223/Study_Material/Unit04_Harmonic_Progression/Unit04_Harmonic_Progresson.html</a></p><p>&quot;<br/>VI always refers to a triad built on a lowered sixth<br/>viio always refers to a triad built on a raised sixth<br/>VII always refers to a triad built on a lowered seventh<br/>viio always refers to a triad built on a raised seventh.<br/>&quot;<br/>So I suppose I should support those too for the minor<br/>key roman numerals...</p><p>&gt; &gt; Sorry, did a Iadd2 there.</p><p>&gt; OK, but why relate to the subdominant.</p><p>Okay - I understand that this doesn&apos;t apply to the classical notation.<br/>But would apply to the popular notation. The C7 has a Bb because<br/>it is a diatonic chord of F major, though it can also be used<br/>as a chromatically altered chord in other keys.</p><p>Well this something of an aside really: I&apos;ll mark it off as such</p><p>..............aside......................</p><p>In the 12 t context, Csus2 for instance has two different<br/>possible just intonation tunings anyway depending on whetehr one thinks<br/>of the 2 as 9/8 or 10/9. I suppose 9/8 there is the more natural<br/>choice as it gives harmonic ninths and means that nearly all the<br/>notes are in the harmonic series, and all of them indeed if you<br/>play a harmonic seventh for the 7.</p><p>So take for example 53-et, with the just major scale as:<br/>(steps) 9 8 5 9 8 9 5</p><p>There you would tune C7 as<br/>0 17 31 44 53</p><p>So far this makes no distinction in tuning between<br/>a chromatically altered tonic and a subdominant tuning</p><p>However, if one did a C7add2, then you have the choice<br/>of<br/>(steps) 8 9 5+9 8+5<br/>and<br/>9 8 5+9 8+5</p><p>The first would tune it to the subdominant and the second<br/>would tune it to the tonic.</p><p>The second one is the more restful one especially<br/>if you also change the final 8+5 to 8+4 for the<br/>7/4 approximation as then it is a harmonic series<br/>chord to best approx in 53-eq. So I suppose that<br/>is the tuning one would use if one thought of<br/>the C7sus2 as a chromatically altered<br/>chord in C major.</p><p>The second one would be a possible choice of<br/>tuning for the dominant 7th of F major<br/>As a just tuning it would be an approximation to<br/>1/1 10/9 5/4 3/2 16/9</p><p>I suppose probably the popular system could<br/>be extended to include either of those<br/>as the desired tuning of C7add2 in 53<br/>equal.</p><p>At present the chord player plays the nearest<br/>to the 12-eq pitches for C7add2, so it will play<br/>the second one 9 8 5+9 8+5</p><p>- or if one adds the tuning symbols to the chord<br/>one could pick out the chords of course<br/>using Cj7add2, or Ck7jadd2 for the 10/9 + 16/9 one<br/>and Ch7add2 for the harmonic series one</p><p>..................end aside................</p><p>&gt; Why? For example, there&apos;s no such think as sus7 in diatonic<br/>&gt; terminology, is there?</p><p>Whether or not, the chord progr. player will let one play<br/>it if one uses it. I suppose I could get it to say that<br/>the chord isn&apos;t recognised if user enters e.g. Isus7<br/>as a symbol. Currently, it will just play it.</p><p>&gt; then you need to do the triads as i(9)</p><p>&gt; I still think &quot;no9&quot; is better, since in standard &apos;popular&apos;<br/>&gt; terminology you see &quot;no3&quot; and &quot;no5&quot; used</p><p>Okay fine, I didn&apos;t understand that it was a notation. Yes,<br/>I can do that, and no risk of confusion with anything<br/>else (won&apos;t get confused with the otonal symbol<br/>because of the preceding &apos;n&apos;).</p><p>&gt; Again, it&apos;s not a matter of generalizing 12, since conventional<br/>&gt; notation applies equally well to all meantone systems, but only if a<br/>&gt; diatonic basis is assumed -- even in 12. My paper hopefully explains<br/>&gt; how diatonic systems (in meantones) relate naturally to triads, while<br/>&gt; decatonic systems (in 22-equal and other decatonic tunings) relate<br/>&gt; naturally to tetrads.</p><p>Okay fine, I haven&apos;t read it in detail yet, so will find out<br/>when I do.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The idea there is that the chord symbol gives the desired exact<br/>pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; which if the notation used was 22-eq would be 22-eq. But then if<br/>user<br/>&gt; &gt; is playing in a just 22 tone scale, each pitch in the chord gets<br/>&gt; &gt; played as the nearest pitch in the current scale.</p><p>&gt; Why &apos;nearest&apos;, necessarily? If there are 22 notes, wouldn&apos;t you want<br/>&gt; to use *all* of them, so have a one-to-one mapping from 22-equal to<br/>&gt; them? If the JI scale is a Constant Structure, this will at least<br/>&gt; never give you one &apos;consonant&apos; chord quality when you&apos;re expecting<br/>&gt; another . . .</p><p>That makes sense, yes, if the scale has the same number of notes as the<br/>notation system then I suppose normally you want to use them all...</p><p>Well, but not always. Suppose user has entered some kind of uneven mixed scale<br/>maybe just a twelve tone scale with many extra intervals for different<br/>flavours of third for instance, and the total number of notes<br/>happens to be 22. Or a harmonic series fragment that<br/>happens to have 22 notes...</p><p>If I allowed one to one correspondences with 22 note scales<br/>then would need a way to find out which ones it can be used<br/>for and which not.</p><p>Using the nearest pitch works pretty well for 12 eq. I suppose<br/>if you use some strange scale like half comma meantone it mightn&apos;t<br/>always find the intended pitch.</p><p>But as you increase the number of notes, the  nearest pitch<br/>method is probably more likely to get you to a &quot;wrong note&quot;<br/>as the notes will move around more relative to the smaller step<br/>size.</p><p>Probably the sort of thing that needs to be an option that<br/>can be set by the user, in the interface or in the<br/>chord progression.</p><p>I&apos;ll need to think it over. Because the notation will also work<br/>with j.i. scales of more than 22 notes too. Maybe then there<br/>will be lots of possible choices, and the nearest  pitch<br/>not the best one for a particular context. So maybe user<br/>has to be able to decide on a just interpretation of<br/>the chord symbols or something. Maybe this can be<br/>left to later; I think it could get rather complex...</p><p>I&apos;m thinking about using key signatures in the chord progression<br/>with the roman numerals notation now BTW.</p><p>Major, or Minor, or to change key in the middle,</p><p>Emajor, or Bmajor  or Dminor (all one word).</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=49077 href="#49077">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/4/2003 9:20:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; In minor keys, presumably it is III in classical notation,</p><p>Yes.</p><p>&gt; for the IIIb which I think you would use in the popular mixed<br/>&gt;notation.</p><p>I doubt that, Robert.</p><p>&gt; Okay - I understand that this doesn&apos;t apply to the classical<br/>notation.<br/>&gt; But would apply to the popular notation.
