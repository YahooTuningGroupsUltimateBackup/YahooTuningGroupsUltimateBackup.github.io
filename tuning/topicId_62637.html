Those composers who use the notation mechanistically<br/>&gt; (Stockhausen) are much more 12EDO composers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Though Schoenberg may have coached the Kolisch in 12EDO,<br/>&gt; I am of the view that the reality of performance vis a vis<br/>&gt; the notation will result in 5 or 7limit serialism.

He deliberately<br/>notated his music after c.1903 following the criteria of<br/>what he deemed to be the &quot;clearest notation&quot;, that is,<br/>he always used, for example, C-natural where the 5-limit<br/>harmonic basis would have dictated that it should be B-sharp.<br/>And by 1908, when his music became atonal, he felt no<br/>need at all for B#, E#, Cb, Fb, or any of the double-sharps<br/>and double-flats.</p><p>Also, he specifically wrote in his _Harmonielehre_ of 1911<br/>a description of how the 12-tone chromatic scale is<br/>derived from the first 11 partials of F, C, and G.<br/>How correct this he was about this is not the issue, but<br/>it does indicate that in his mind he viewed use of the<br/>chromatic scale as being far beyond 5-limit and even<br/>7-limit harmony. In the _Harmonielehre_ he was thinking<br/>in terms of 11-limit, and in his later lecture &quot;Problems<br/>of Harmony&quot;, he gave the same kind of description but<br/>also included ratios of 13.</p><p>And the fact plain fact is that the reason why he coached<br/>the Kolisch Quartet so painstakingly in 12-edo was deliberately<br/>so that they would *not* give JI inflections to their intonation.<br/>How others perform his music is another subject for analysis,<br/>but Schoenberg&apos;s intentions regarding the intonation of his<br/>music are quite clear.</p><p>You&apos;d probably be interested in taking a look at some<br/>of my work on Schoenberg&apos;s theories:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/schoenberg/harm/monzo-intro.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/schoenberg/harm/monzo-intro.htm</a></p><p>Chapter 4 of _Harmonielehre_ is where he gives his description<br/>of the chromatic scale. Unfortunately this is all still<br/>a &quot;work in progress&quot;.</p><p>Even less finished is my work on analyzing Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>harmonic theories, but there&apos;s still a lot there to digest:</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/schoenberg/harm/1911-1922.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/schoenberg/harm/1911-1922.htm</a></p><p>If you&apos;re seriously interested in non-12-edo serialism,<br/>that does exist too. Probably the prime proponent of it<br/>is Ben Johnston, who composes in extended-JI (up to<br/>31-limit AFAIK).</p><p>Johnston&apos;s _6th Quartet_ is in 11-limit JI, and is a<br/>serial piece which arranges the 12-tone row as two<br/>hexachords, each of which is a Partchian 1-3-5-7-9-11<br/>hexad, one otonal and the other utonal. I&apos;ve written<br/>a lot about it here before, at various different times<br/>over the years.
