We were not told that this is a man-made<br/>system.  We were not told that there was a Natural Tuning System that<br/>contained an infinite variety of notes and chords.  We were taught to<br/>ignore the true consonance, magic, and beauty of Nature&apos;s Tuning and<br/>to be content with expressing ourselves based on 12-Equal Tempered<br/>notes per octave.  The tyranny of this man-made system has made its<br/>way onto every guitar neck sold in every store, every piano keyboard,<br/>every radio, every school where music is taught to children.  We have<br/>been taught to accept the chords played on these instruments as &quot;in<br/>tune.&quot;  We have been misled to think that there are only 12 different<br/>notes available to us.  We have learned to forget about Nature and to<br/>accept the compromised and limited set of pitches that Man came up<br/>with over 250 years ago.</p><p>We have been deceived.</p><p>        The purpose of this book is to offer a glimpse into the<br/>Natural Tuning of the Harmonic Series that has been ignored for so<br/>long, and to propose a starting point for future use.&quot;</p><p>Copyright &copy; 2003 by FreeNote Music</p><p>All rights reserved</p><p><a href="http://www.microtones.com">www.microtones.com</a></p><p>Contact: freenote at earthlink dot net</p></div><h3><a id=42380 href="#42380">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2003 2:32:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Just got this announcement and hadn&apos;t seen prior mention of it on the<br/>&gt;list, so here goes:</p><p>Where&apos;d ya see that, Jon?
