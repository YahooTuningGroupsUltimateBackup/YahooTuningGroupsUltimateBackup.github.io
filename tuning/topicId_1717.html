Direct electric connection is better, unless<br/>you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; got a lot of money to spend.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>OK. So other than the cost, what is the disadvantage of using midi?  I can<br/>think of several advantages --particularily the ability to compose with a<br/>software sequencer where compositions could played on a timer, or a<br/>compositon could provide a background for live improvisation with the<br/>carillon or other instruments.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I was planning to use old computer keyboard switches.  Any thoughts on<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt;type of switch?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t use it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>What type of switch would you use?  I have tactile switches that have a<br/>very short throw, but they feel kind of stiff and unresponsive.  This may<br/>not be the case once they get wide keycaps.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;If you looked at the keyboard arrangement. the changes should be<br/>apparent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I did look.  It seems you&apos;ve put the the interval classes into rows.<br/>This<br/>&gt; is a pretty minor change.</p><p>Yes, Im not claiming any innovation.  Basically what I have done is lined<br/>up three octaves of the 8 X 8 matrix and removed the pitches of lesser<br/>frequency than the 1/1 and greater frequency than the 4/1.  One reason I<br/>have done this is that I have 122 solenoids to work with.  I could<br/>manufacture more, although I find it helpful to impose certain limits on<br/>the project so that it does not remain in the status of vaporware ad<br/>infinitum. Also, the keyboard layout provides for 128 switches -- one midi<br/>channel.  I could go to two midi channels, but this again provides a<br/>limiting factor to keep the project down to earth.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I&apos;d rather have a three octaves of straight diamond than two of enriched<br/>&gt; &gt;diamond.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Why?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, this is essentially what I have done, except I have chopped off the<br/>upper and lower ends to accommodate my limitations.  Your three octaves of<br/>straight diamond provides all the resources of the diamond as a complete<br/>scale in two octaves.  I will work on the voice leading advantages of using<br/>the diamond in this way.  You are turning me into a theorist, thanks for<br/>the challenges! A carpenter metamorphises into a theorist.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The idea is very simple.   I am coming to Gainesville in the next month<br/>&gt; sometime.  Perhaps we could get together?  I&apos;d love to see how the work<br/>is<br/>&gt; coming.  I&apos;m sure you could teach me a lot.  Maybe you know a place I<br/>could<br/>&gt; crash for a night or two?  Pat has a cat, which I am allergic to.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Cool -- I will work on the crash pad for you. I have a cat also.  Monzo&apos;s<br/>coming to.  I would<br/>definitely be intersted in getting together.</p><p>Darren<br/>SEJIS, Gainesville</p></div>
