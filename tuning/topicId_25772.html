They are Mathemusicians. They only use scales with<br/>mathematical properties, symmetries, etc.</p><p>Nothing wrong with that.</p><p>Me? I use primarily scales that tuning big-shots find laughable. I often use the Go Fish scale,<br/>not a sub-set of the Miracle family of scales. The Go Fish scale is normally composed thus: I<br/>create a 1/1 in whatever &quot;key&quot; i wish. Then i choose the next appropriate interval, from the pitch<br/>&quot;infinitum&quot;, whose distance and &quot;mood&quot; i like. Something around/ between a 13/12 or an 8/7. You<br/>get the picture.</p><p>My point is, i have never let a scale tell me what to do, nor have i needed &quot;a scale&quot; to get me<br/>started.</p><p>Meaning, i write from my &quot;minds ear&quot;.</p><p>So, the question is, how many people here write a larger percentage of their music without the<br/>&quot;background&quot; of systems both compositional, and scalar? Who just writes music from the heart, math<br/>be damned?</p><p>I&apos;m not trying to say my way or the high-way. I have written a fair share of mathemusic.<br/>Just curious.</p><p>Offlist replies welcome.</p><p>George Zelenz</p></div><h3>Ed Borasky &#x3C;znmeb@aracnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/29/2001 10:14:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., George Zelenz &lt;ploo@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Many of the people on this list, and thousands of other composers,<br/>belong to a genus of composers<br/>&gt; that write music that i call &quot;mathemusic&quot;.

In fact, I&apos;ll go even<br/>further. I more or less exclusively use computers to compose and<br/>perform my music. I revel in the perfection I obtain.

It really sucked -- great (though depressing) words<br/>and a childish melody. It didn&apos;t work for me. I switched to computer<br/>music shortly thereafter and never looked back.</p><p>&gt; So, the question is, how many people here write a larger percentage<br/>of their music without the<br/>&gt; &quot;background&quot; of systems both compositional, and scalar? Who just<br/>writes music from the heart, math<br/>&gt; be damned?</p><p>My music is cold, precise, heartless. The best thing I ever did,<br/>really the only one of my lost tapes that I&apos;d give *anything* to<br/>find, was a collection of &quot;found music&quot; recorded from the actual<br/>sounds of computers at work. I wrote it as background music for a<br/>student theater production called &quot;Man Proposes, Machine Disposes&quot;.</p><p>One act was a theatrical adaptation of Gordon Dickson&apos;s &quot;Computers<br/>Don&apos;t Argue&quot;, about a man who gets into a computer foul-up with a<br/>book club and ends up being executed for the kidnap and murder of<br/>Robert Louis Stevenson. In a way, it&apos;s funny ... in another way, it&apos;s<br/>chilling. The cold precision of computers at work, spinning their<br/>tapes, reading their cards, clicking their typewriters with no human<br/>at the keyboard and punching paper tape was *exactly* what I wanted.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not trying to say my way or the high-way. I have written a fair<br/>share of mathemusic.</p><p>Why don&apos;t you take the next logical step, then? Program a computer to<br/>do it for you, then just sit back and listen. Tweak the parameters,<br/>twiddle the knobs, listen some more. Tweak some more, hack the code a<br/>little, rewrite some routines, listen some more. At some point, your<br/>little toy will become a living thing ... a wonderful artificial life<br/>form ... it will acquire a &quot;heart&quot;, a &quot;soul&quot; and a &quot;voice&quot;. Trust<br/>me ... I didn&apos;t believe it at first, either. But it happened --<br/>digital systems are like that, once they reach a certain level of<br/>complexity and adaptive capability. Fractal Tune Smithy is more or<br/>less at this point now; if you&apos;re not a programmer just get FTS and<br/>play with it. The operative word here is *play* :-).<br/>--<br/>M.

The two web sites are identical -- this whole thing started out as<br/>a hobby web page and someone said, &quot;Hey, why don&apos;t you start a<br/>business?&quot; Right now, I&apos;m leaning towards becoming a non-profit<br/>organization rather than a business, but the whole thing is really in<br/>a state of flux. I&apos;m not willing at this point to give up a lucrative<br/>day job, which pays for all my expensive hobbies.</p><p>2. I have indeed been making music with computers for quite some<br/>time -- roughly since 1966, as I mentioned in the earlier post. At<br/>present I have exactly one recording, which I made on a KIM-1 in<br/>roughly the time period when the KIM-1 was popular. That would be<br/>roughly concurrent with the early Radio Shack TRS-80 and the early<br/>Apples. It is interesting but not worth posting; it&apos;s essentially<br/>just computer sounds. In the early 1980s, I had a Commodore 64 and<br/>did a few things on it, but essentially gave up computer music when<br/>my job at the time had me travelling most of the week, so I wasn&apos;t<br/>around to work on the music.</p><p>I think some of the older stuff is on tapes buried in a closet. There<br/>should be a rather terrible stochastic composition from 1966, and<br/>there should be the piece I mentioned in another post, which actually<br/>has a title: _Suite and Sour for &quot;Computers Don&apos;t Argue&quot;_ That&apos;s the<br/>one I really want to find; it could be cleaned up digitally and is<br/>interesting at least to me. If I had that one, I would post it. If<br/>the Internet had been available to me in 1974, I would have posted it<br/>then.</p><p>3. One of the joys of having three hobbies and a day job is that<br/>there is always something to do. As a result, progress on any one of<br/>them can be agonizingly slow, especially when the day job goes into a<br/>demanding mode, which it has done recently. So when the Partch -<br/>Xenakis code gets to the point where it is producing music that I<br/>like, I will definitely be posting some of its output for posterity<br/>on the Internet. I hope it is worth the wait.<br/>--<br/>M.
