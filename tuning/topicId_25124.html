I was an<br/>undergraduate at the University of Illinois (Champaign-Urbana) from<br/>1959 - 1962, and I there discovered four composers who sparked my<br/>interest in electronic and computer music. Two, Lejaren Hiller and<br/>Harry Partch, were actually in residence there at the time. I was<br/>privileged to see a performance of &quot;Revelation in the Courthouse<br/>Park&quot;. The other two are Alwin Nikolais, a frequent visitor with his<br/>dance troupe, and Iannis Xenakis, who with Hiller founded algorithmic<br/>composition in the 1950s and 1960s.</p><p>BTW, my incoming e-mail is down ... my ISP screwed up and they&apos;re<br/>trying to pin the blame on Network Solutions.

Both CD&apos;s have pieces by other composers played on Partch&apos;s instruments and/or Drummond&apos;s similar metal diamond marimba arrangement  Zoomoozophone (I forget the exact spelling) which uses 35 of the 43 tone scale, as I recall.  I believe the earlier CD is available only from Drummond, if he still has any left.  It could be overnighted to you in the time remaining.  His email address includes the word spyral but I don&apos;t have it all handy.  (There are few posts from him to the list.)  But you can probably reach him through the Montclair State University phone number listed in connection with this Sunday&apos;s concerts and &quot;instrument petting zoo&quot; open house:  (973) 655-5112.<br/>Apart from music influenced by Partch, there are quite a few composers and compositions listed in his &quot;Genesis of a Music&quot; which he &quot;approved of&quot; (even if they did not necessarily influence him), such as the songs of Hugo Wolf (probably including his opera, &quot;Der Corregidor&quot;), &quot;Socrate&quot; by Eric Satie, Debussy&apos;s &quot;Martyrdom of St. Sebastian&quot; and &quot;Pelleas and Melisande&quot;.  It is quite remarkable that Harry had some familiarity with such a diversity of compositions before recordings of many of these works had been made, virtually before the start of the LP era (referring to the first edition of &quot;Genesis&quot;.  Even the Hugo Wolf Society 78&apos;s were a limited edition.)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="mailto:KSchmir@z.zgs.de">KSchmir@z.zgs.de</a> 06/14/01 09:40PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Hola todos!</p><p>I am privileged to have 2 hours of community radio time to fill on<br/>Partch&apos;s birthday. und I&apos;d rather not ignore this date.

If<br/>you want all the specific details I could easily find out but I dont have<br/>Ben&apos;s original master tapes handy to look and see what quartets did what...<br/>If you want more specifics let me know and I&apos;ll look on all the old tapes in<br/>a few days.</p><p>Everything has been totally digitally remastered. The first quartet came from<br/>a tape made in the 60&apos;s. I dont remember the quartet that performed it. This<br/>was a piece written while Ben was studying with John Cage in New York.</p><p>The 2-6th quartet also came from tapes but are more recent. The 4th quartet<br/>is a different version then the one on the White Man Sleeps album. It  is<br/>done by the fine arts quartet, which is the group it was originally intended<br/>for. Its also a live recording.<br/>I dont remember off the top of my head which quartets recorded 2,3,5,6. I can<br/>find out if you want to know.</p><p>The ninth quartet is not remastered. It comes from a commercial(?) recording<br/>done by the stanford quartet and is on a CD.  It is absolutely incredible if<br/>you haven&apos;t heard that piece. Its tonal like the fourth, pretty much at<br/>least, but it is extremely different than the fourth to say the least.</p><p>Sadly there are no recordings of the 7th, 8th, or 10th quartets ... or at<br/>least not recordings that Ben or I know about.</p><p>It was cool doing this work, because remastering these tapes let me listen to<br/>these recordings MANY MANY MANY times and so, therefore, I got extremely<br/>familiar with the quartets. Plus its great music!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Andy</p></div><h3><a id=25408 href="#25408">ðŸ”—</a>JoJoBuBu@aol.com</h3><span>6/20/2001 9:12:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 6/20/2001 11:57:16 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:ploo@mindspring.com">ploo@mindspring.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; Me TOO!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>The CD is availabe from Ben.
