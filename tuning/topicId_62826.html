It seems to me that the<br/>&gt; &gt; most likely reasons for anyone&apos;s choosing 144-EDO<br/>&gt; &gt; would be to allow further rational division of 12<br/>&gt; &gt; equal semitones into halves, quarters, sixths and<br/>&gt; &gt; twelfths - the simplest of these being the quarter-<br/>&gt; &gt; tone.  Had he contemplated 144-EDO, it can hardly<br/>&gt; &gt; have escaped his notice that it supports quarter-<br/>&gt; &gt; tones.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In perplexity,<br/>&gt; &gt; Yahya<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At least part of the reason for your perplexity is<br/>&gt; the fact that my Aristoxenus page is very sloppy and<br/>&gt; badly in need of editing ... something which i&apos;ve needed<br/>&gt; to do for years but just can&apos;t get to until i have a<br/>&gt; serious block of time to devote to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For starters, i used the Latinized spelling of his name,<br/>&gt; but when i finally edit the page i&apos;ll probably stick to<br/>&gt; the Greek spelling Aristoxenos.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The most important thing to point out about his theories<br/>&gt; is that, at the end of his process of &quot;tuning by concords&quot;,<br/>&gt; that is, upon reaching the 12th note, the last concord<br/>&gt; derived is supposed to sound similar to all the other ones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is impossible in true pythagorean tuning, because<br/>&gt; the last &quot;concord&quot; will be smaller by a pythagorean comma,<br/>&gt; i.e., a type of &quot;wolf-5th&quot; of ~678 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The last section of my page, &quot;Amendment from 2003.07.20&quot;,<br/>&gt; represents my latest thoughts on the subject -- so while<br/>&gt; everything before it is interesting, and worth reading from<br/>&gt; a historical point of view, what i propose in this last<br/>&gt; section is what i think most likely represents Aristoxenos&apos;s<br/>&gt; theories.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aristoxenos used divisions as small as 1/12-tone and 1/8-tone<br/>&gt; in his actual descriptions, and so the smallest division<br/>&gt; needed to encompass all the possibilities in his various<br/>&gt; generic shades is 1/24-tone. Obviously, this implies 144-edo.</p><p>Obviously!</p><p>&gt; I describe a mathematical procedure which exactly follows<br/>&gt; his descriptions, wherein a &quot;ditone&quot; (major-3rd) is tuned<br/>&gt; by concords but then is assumed to be a logarithmic 4/5 of<br/>&gt; a &quot;perfect-4th&quot;. ...</p><p>Perhaps by a statement in the form that 5 ditones<br/>produce the same interval as 4 fourths?</p><p>&gt; ... Assuming the perfect-4th to be a pythagorean<br/>&gt; 4/3 ratio, this leads to a smallest division of (4/3)^(1/60),<br/>&gt; and was the division described by Cleonides, whose work is<br/>&gt; a main source for Aristoxenos.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But one cannot assume Aristoxenos&apos;s &quot;perfect-4th&quot; to be<br/>&gt; a 4/3 ratio, because of the discrepancy of the size of<br/>&gt; &quot;concords&quot; in his &quot;tuning by concords&quot; method, as mentioned<br/>&gt; above.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So ultimately, 144-edo seems to be the best tuning to assume<br/>&gt; for the fitting together of all the disparate and seemingly<br/>&gt; contradictory statements made by Aristoxenos. That&apos;s why<br/>&gt; i used 144-edo for the tuning of the notated illustrations<br/>&gt; and audio examples at the end of my webpage.</p><p>Thank you.

But i digress ...)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But as i said, Aristoxenos&apos;s &quot;tuning by concords&quot; with<br/>&gt; 12 different pitches which encompass a series of &quot;5ths&quot;<br/>&gt; (_diapente_) which are *all* supposed to be &quot;perfect&quot;,<br/>&gt; rules out using a &quot;pure&quot; 4/3 for the &quot;4th&quot;, and hence<br/>&gt; the whole system must be tempered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hasten to point out that Aristoxenos *emphatically*<br/>&gt; avoided using string-lengths or any other type of pitch<br/>&gt; measurement which would result in the use of ratios,<br/>&gt; preferring instead to speak of string *tension*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hence, Aristoxenos&apos;s _syntonon_ should be translated as<br/>&gt; &quot;tense&quot; and his _malakon_ as &quot;relaxed&quot;, instead of the<br/>&gt; &quot;intense&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; which Partch and most other theorists<br/>&gt; use when discussing his theories in English.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aristoxenos insisted that &quot;musicians know what a concord<br/>&gt; sounds like&quot;, and refused to quantify it -- presumably<br/>&gt; because without being able to calculate powers and<br/>&gt; logarithms, he couldn&apos;t pinpoint the measurements of<br/>&gt; his tempered system any more precisely than speaking of<br/>&gt; &quot;parts of a tone&quot;.</p><p>That&apos;s a reasonable theory.  To it you might add<br/>that he found the previous attempts to quantify<br/>it unable to produce the sound of a concord that<br/>every musician recognised.</p><p>However, a bias in favour of perception rather<br/>than measurement could also have lead him to<br/>ignore the difference in size of the two tones,<br/>and to use the term &quot;half a tone&quot; less precisely,<br/>to mean &quot;a part of a tone&quot;.

Two wide<br/>tones, descending, followed by a relaxed shade, would<br/>certainly make an expressive tetrachord.</p><p>&gt; As i pointed out regarding Aristoxenos&apos;s use of the<br/>&gt; concept of string tension instead of length, he was<br/>&gt; deliberately distancing himself from the pythagoreans.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; His description of &quot;tuning by concords&quot; can only be<br/>&gt; achieved by some form of temperament, and he impudently<br/>&gt; states that &quot;musicians know what a concord sounds like&quot;<br/>&gt; when he deliberately avoids using a ratio to measure one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So it seems to me that when he speaks of a &quot;4th&quot; containing<br/>&gt; &quot;two and a half tones&quot;, he is again deliberately throwing<br/>&gt; sand in the face of the pythagoreans. IOW, regardless of<br/>&gt; what numerical complexities the pythagoreans weave in order<br/>&gt; to prove that there is no such thing as precisely 1/2-tone,<br/>&gt; Aristoxenos states that musicians deal with quasi-equal<br/>&gt; 1/2-tones as an established fact.</p><p>A very natural and reasonable thing to do, from<br/>a performer&apos;s point of view!</p><p>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a reasonable theory.  To it you might add<br/>&gt; &gt; that he found the previous attempts to quantify<br/>&gt; &gt; it unable to produce the sound of a concord that<br/>&gt; &gt; every musician recognised.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To the extent that pythagorean mathematics and the<br/>&gt; &quot;tuning by concords&quot; process produces a wolf-4th at<br/>&gt; the end of the procedure, that&apos;s true. But it also<br/>&gt; needs to be pointed out that the 144-edo tempered 4th<br/>&gt; is the familiar 12-edo one of 500 cents, which is a<br/>&gt; largely inaudible discrepancy from the ~498 cents of<br/>&gt; the pythagorean 4/3 ratio 4th.</p><p>The difference, 2 cents, is about the agreed<br/>limit of our ability to perceive.  However, I think<br/>your previous paragraph confuses the issue.  Let&apos;s<br/>disentangle the threads:<br/>1.  You agreed that the pythagorean maths produces<br/>a wolf-4th, which I was guessing Aristoxenos was<br/>objecting to.<br/>2.  You state, as justification for your theory that<br/>Aristoxenos meant 144-EDO, that its 4th is almost<br/>just, as far as our ears can tell.<br/>3.  But you also state that Aristoxenos&apos; &quot;tuning<br/>by concords&quot; process produces a wolf-4th!</p><p>Points 2. and 3. are not compatible; either the last<br/>4th is a wolf, or it isn&apos;t; if it&apos;s (almost) just, it isn&apos;t<br/>a wolf.</p><p>I&apos;m really going to have to read your page on<br/>Aristoxenos, aren&apos;t I?</p><p>&gt; &gt; However, a bias in favour of perception rather<br/>&gt; &gt; than measurement could also have lead him to<br/>&gt; &gt; ignore the difference in size of the two tones,<br/>&gt; &gt; and to use the term &quot;half a tone&quot; less precisely,<br/>&gt; &gt; to mean &quot;a part of a tone&quot;.  So that in writing of<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;two and a half tones&quot; making the diatessaron,<br/>&gt; &gt; perhaps he meant, from the starting note, &quot;one<br/>&gt; &gt; tone higher than that, then another, then part<br/>&gt; &gt; of another&quot;?  I&apos;m disinclined to see &quot;two and a<br/>&gt; &gt; half tones&quot; as meaning &quot;2.5 tones&quot;, unless we see<br/>&gt; &gt; him doing arithmetic with that number.  What do<br/>&gt; &gt; you think?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aristoxenos was certainly dealing in approximations,<br/>&gt; as Partch so indignantly accused him of doing.</p><p>Good on him!  ... if that served his musical purposes<br/>well enough.  But then how would he be thinking of<br/>an unprecedentedly fine division of the fourth?</p><p>&gt; But apparently what&apos;s going on here is that Aristoxenos<br/>&gt; wanted to employ concepts derived from the then-new<br/>&gt; geometry expounded by Euclid. He saw Euclidean geometry<br/>&gt; as a way to measure divisions of irrational musical intervals,<br/>&gt; which the pythagorean mathematics before him were unable<br/>&gt; to deal with.</p><p>Now that is interesting!  And those geometric<br/>methods permit, in principle, of arbitrary accuracy<br/>of measurement - simply draw your diagrams large<br/>enough, and you get the number of decimal places<br/>you want.  Of course, there ARE practical limits.</p><p>But given that Aristoxenos was impressed by the<br/>mensurational powers of the new geometry, I&apos;m<br/>surprised you say he was dealing in approximations.</p><p>&gt; So i&apos;m not convinced that he intended his measurements<br/>&gt; to be as vague as they might seem to us moderns. Having<br/>&gt; thought about this for years, and done a lot of research<br/>&gt; into it, i&apos;m quite convinced that 144-edo is pretty much<br/>&gt; what Aristoxenos had in mind when writing his theories.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (BTW, the character of Aristoxenos&apos;s two suriviving books<br/>&gt; seems to indicate that they were not written down by him,<br/>&gt; but that they are notes written down by students attending<br/>&gt; his lectures.)</p><p>Ouch!  But better than nothing.  I wonder if they<br/>were GOOD students?</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Note, however, that i don&apos;t agree with Partch that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Aristoxenos deserves the credit (dubious credit, according<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to Partch) for being &quot;the father of temperament&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I speculated that the Sumerians, with their base-60<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematics, ...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (It occurred to me that this was perhaps a<br/>&gt; &gt; factor in Cleonides&apos; choice - dividing the<br/>&gt; &gt; classically perfect consonance, the diatessaron<br/>&gt; &gt; or fourth 4/3, into the classically perfect<br/>&gt; &gt; number of parts, 60, which the Greeks also<br/>&gt; &gt; inherited and perpetuated in geometry.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Sumerians, Babylonians, and Greeks were all quite<br/>&gt; fond of base-60 mathematics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ... did have the ability to derive a very good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; approximation of 12-edo (or indeed any temperament)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as early as c.2500 BC -- and it has been satisfactorily<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; documented that the Greeks got a lot of their cultural<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and scientific knowledge from the Babylonians, who got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; theirs from the Sumerians.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/sumerian/simplified-sumerian-tuning.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/sumerian/simplified-sumerian-tuning.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Tho the Greeks got much from the<br/>&gt; &gt; Babylonians, they built on it.  Did the<br/>&gt; &gt; Babylonians themselves invent nothing?  :-)<br/>&gt; &gt; The inheritors of the Greeks, the Arabs and<br/>&gt; &gt; other savants of early Islam, in their turn<br/>&gt; &gt; added much that he Greeks had not thought<br/>&gt; &gt; of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your assessment is pretty accurate. The Babylonians<br/>&gt; did add a few new twists, especially in mathematics,<br/>&gt; but culturally their legacy was basically that of<br/>&gt; adapting the Sumerian innovations to their own society.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The truth is that there have not been many Sumerian<br/>&gt; mathematical tablets deciphered and/or published.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the Babylonians retained the Sumerian logograms<br/>&gt; in their own words for the &quot;root&quot; concept of the word<br/>&gt; and added their own written symbols to represent the<br/>&gt; phonics of the Akkadian syllables -- very similar to<br/>&gt; the way modern Japanese writing retains the Chinese<br/>&gt; logograms and adds further symbols for the Japanese<br/>&gt; syllables.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So by stripping away the Akkadian syllables, as i have<br/>&gt; done on my webpage, one can see the underlying Sumerian<br/>&gt; basis of all of the Babylonian mathematical texts.<br/>&gt; And the essence of the math problems is already there<br/>&gt; in the Sumerian.</p><p>A very nice deduction!</p><p>I won&apos;t bother you further on this topic until<br/>I&apos;ve done at least the basic reading - your page.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>Version: 7.1.371 / Virus Database: 267.14.1/206 - Release Date: 16/12/05</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/19/2005 12:35:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Yahya,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I trust your good intentions, and I think you have<br/>&gt; an unsurpassed reputation on this list for musically<br/>&gt; relevant accuracy.

But then how would he be thinking of<br/>&gt; an unprecedentedly fine division of the fourth?</p><p>A large part of Aristoxenos&apos;s program was to refute<br/>the traditional, well-established music-theory of the<br/>pythagoreans, in part because their mathematics were<br/>unable to describe the more subtle divisions of<br/>generic shades which Aristoxenos perceived to be in<br/>use among musicians.</p><p>Archytas had been the first music-theorist to write<br/>about the 3 different genera (diatonic, chromatic,<br/>and enharmonic). But Archytas made only the second<br/>note from the top of the tetrachord a moveable one<br/>-- i.e., all 3 of his genera have same pitch at the<br/>top, bottom, and the note above the bottom.</p><p>Aristoxenos criticized this and said that the<br/>enharmonic genus has its own small interval at the<br/>bottom of the tetrachord. He gives a nod of recognition<br/>to the harmonists, a school of non-pythagorean<br/>music-theorists who used _katapyknosis_ to divide<br/>larger intervals.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But apparently what&apos;s going on here is that Aristoxenos<br/>&gt; &gt; wanted to employ concepts derived from the then-new<br/>&gt; &gt; geometry expounded by Euclid. He saw Euclidean geometry<br/>&gt; &gt; as a way to measure divisions of irrational musical intervals,<br/>&gt; &gt; which the pythagorean mathematics before him were unable<br/>&gt; &gt; to deal with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now that is interesting!

Of course, there ARE practical limits.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But given that Aristoxenos was impressed by the<br/>&gt; mensurational powers of the new geometry, I&apos;m<br/>&gt; surprised you say he was dealing in approximations.</p><p>Well, he had to be, if he intended his musical system<br/>to be tempered, because the mathematics of his time<br/>was not able to deal with the irrational intervals<br/>of temperament in any way other than the use of geometry.<br/>Tempered intervals can only be represented exactly in<br/>numbers with the use of base-plus-exponent notation,<br/>which didn&apos;t come along until the 1600s (and was refined<br/>only a few years ago by yours truly and Gene Ward Smith<br/>into the &quot;monzo&quot; notation).</p><p>AFAIK, the scholar who first pointed out the geometrical<br/>aspect of Aristoxenos&apos;s theories is Malcolm Litchfield:</p><p>Litchfield, Malcolm.  1988.<br/> &apos;Aristoxenus and Empiricism:<br/> A Reevalutation Based on his Theories&apos;.<br/> _Journal of Music Theory_, v 32 # 1, p 51-73.</p><p>&gt; &gt; (BTW, the character of Aristoxenos&apos;s two suriviving books<br/>&gt; &gt; seems to indicate that they were not written down by him,<br/>&gt; &gt; but that they are notes written down by students attending<br/>&gt; &gt; his lectures.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ouch!  But better than nothing.  I wonder if they<br/>&gt; were GOOD students?</p><p>Apparently so ... the surviving texts are very detailed.<br/>And for the parts that are missing, we have Cleonides to<br/>fill in the gaps.</p><p>The existing texts of Aristoxenos appear to be from<br/>two different periods in his career, one early and one<br/>late. They cover much of the same material, but the<br/>second book (the presumed later text) is a good deal<br/>more sophisticated.</p><p>I should also point out here that Aristoxenos&apos;s theories<br/>carried a great deal of weight in the ancient world:<br/>*every* subsequent Greek and Roman music-theorist whose<br/>work survives speaks of musical material in the Aristoxenean<br/>terms of the Lesser Perfect System, Greater Perfect System,<br/>Perfect Immutable System, and tetrachords with two fixed<br/>bounding notes and two moveable inner notes.</p><p>This is true all the way up to Boethius, who lived more<br/>than 800 years after Aristoxenos -- and of course,<br/>Boethius&apos;s theories were perpetuated first by the<br/>Carolingian Franks c.800-1100, and then again by the<br/>Renaissance Italians in the 1500s.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So by stripping away the Akkadian syllables, as i have<br/>&gt; &gt; done on my webpage, one can see the underlying Sumerian<br/>&gt; &gt; basis of all of the Babylonian mathematical texts.<br/>&gt; &gt; And the essence of the math problems is already there<br/>&gt; &gt; in the Sumerian.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A very nice deduction!</p><p>But the link you have is for my webpage about the<br/>*simplified* Sumerian version of 12-edo. The older<br/>webpage i made about this has a 3-sexagesimal-place<br/>approximation, which obviously is more accurate still,<br/>and that page is the one where i have translations of<br/>an actual Babylonian mathematical tablet.</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/sumerian/sumerian-tuning.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/monzo/sumerian/sumerian-tuning.htm</a></p><p>I should also mention that someone, quite a while back,<br/>sent me an email about this page explaining that these<br/>math problems were not about tuning, but were about<br/>farming acreage or something like that. I&apos;ve been really<br/>busy and just filed that away for later perusal, but<br/>thought that it should be mentioned here.</p><p>Robson, whose book has the translations of these and<br/>hundreds of other Babylonian math texts, surmises that<br/>they deal with the measurement of bricks. I&apos;m inclined<br/>to agree with that, as the Sumerian and Babylonian<br/>civilizations were entirely based on their ability<br/>to use the clay-mud at their disposal to make bricks,<br/>which they then used to build dams, canals, roads,<br/>temples, and cities. There were no other natural<br/>resources available to them -- neither stone nor wood.</p><p>I find it *very* interesting that all of the common<br/>small musical intervals (&quot;commas&quot;) are also found in<br/>Babylonian texts concerning weights and measures.<br/>Ratios such as 81/80 (the syntonic-comma) and 128/125<br/>(the diesis) pop up as discrepancies between different<br/>systems of measurement for such things as silver, barley,<br/>or standard brick sizes for different city-states.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div>
