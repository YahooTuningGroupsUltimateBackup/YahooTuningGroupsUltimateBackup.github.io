I have posted<br/>about 30 videos on Youtube under my screen-name &quot;violinissimo&quot;,<br/>playing in my intonation. I have just recorded the Beethoven violin<br/>concerto first movement, but the difference this time is that I also<br/>tuned all the string parts in the accompanyuing midi orchestra using<br/>the pitch-wheel command, one PW command before each note, not one PW<br/>command for each channel! I separated all duplicating notes in any<br/>same channels - so I used all 15 channels just for the strings. I<br/>recorded the winds in another audio file and mixed the resulted audio<br/>files, which I then play with it on the violin.</p><p>The following are some comments on my previous performances -</p><p>Very nice, different but what an outstanding interpretation<br/>.. congratulations for performing it with such musicality and beauty.<br/>You have a very unique style and I appreciate that.<br/>.. this is my favourite Meditation on you tube by far.<br/>very touching i like your style, it&apos;s very personal and unique, very<br/>throwback. It&apos;s nice rather than hearing the same brahms all the time<br/>Bravo! Breathtaking,..<br/>Me gusta demasiado como se escucha el violin y el piano en particular<br/>en esta melodia, el inicio de la pieza esta excelente, la he<br/>escuchado mas lento el comienzo y</p><p>le da mayor sentimiento.
