I feel I have a pretty good<br/>grasp of the current scientific answers to these questions.</p><p>But I also understand that there is a level to these questions that<br/>science could never answer, and never claims to be able to answer.</p><p>But pre-logical or &quot;magical&quot; answers aren&apos;t satisfying either. One<br/>doesn&apos;t need to reject logic, only to recognise its limitations. There<br/>is marvelously unlogical book called &quot;The Tao is Silent&quot; by an<br/>emminent logician, Raymond Smullyan. But he hasn&apos;t rejected logic, he<br/>has pushed it to its absolute limits and then fallen off the end! The<br/>answers (or the un-asking of the questions) lies not in the<br/>pre-logical, but the trans-logical or mystical.</p><p>&gt; Same for music...cannot be<br/>thought of<br/>&gt; as &quot;logical,&quot; because it comes from a place much older than that<br/>sort of<br/>&gt; thought.</p><p>Indeed. But some aspects are clearly amenable to logical analysis (or<br/>Dave Cope&apos;s SARA wouldn&apos;t be as successful as it is, for example).</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve see/experienced way too much in this life that is not<br/>&gt; remotely explainable by any sort of logic, but is only understood by<br/>the<br/>&gt; experience of living it.</p><p>Sure. I expect we all have.</p><p>&gt; And, that&apos;s where Art resides,</p><p>Maybe a lot less of it than you think.</p><p>&gt; and it&apos;s partly<br/>&gt; why many great artists have been a bit whacked; it&apos;s like riding a<br/>wave,<br/>&gt; and &quot;you&quot; are definitely NOT in control of &quot;it.&quot; It can be a wild<br/>&gt; ride...Hstick</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Do you think mystics make music?

A true scientist lives with this thought every day.<br/>We might feel we are aiming _towards_ some kind of absolute truth, but<br/>we only ever expect to attain _relative_ truths. Absolute truth cannot<br/>be put into words. The main problem is that most scientists are<br/>unwilling to apply the scientific method to the _introspective_ sense,<br/>as the buddhists and others (including Wilber) have done/ are doing.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan</p><p>The above is only theory and may well be wrong.</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>2/27/2001 10:17:21 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave,</p><p>I really fear that we are going far OT for the tuning list, but I<br/>would like to pursue it privately in the days ahead. About the more<br/>pertinant items:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Can you entertain the thought that &quot;satisfying&quot; would vary from<br/>&gt; &gt; person to person, culture to culture?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh absolutely! I&apos;m sorry. I only meant that such answers aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; usually very satisfying to anyone who has achieved any level of<br/>&gt; critical or logical thinking. You can&apos;t really go back</p><p>This is what I supposed, that you can&apos;t &apos;go back&apos;, and at this point<br/>it is my belief that there could very well be negative aspects to<br/>said person&apos;s &apos;evolution&apos;.</p><p>About SARA, I replied:<br/>&gt; &gt; It is successful only insofar (one word?) at mimicing works<br/>&gt; &gt; created by human experience.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How could this disqualify it. Don&apos;t many human composers start out<br/>&gt; this way?</p><p>I&apos;m not disqualifying it; I simply don&apos;t have any reverence for a<br/>difference engine allowed to chew up Mozart and spew (hyperbole<br/>mine!). And I hasten to add that I have long been fascinated with,<br/>and have used (and even programmed a bit) algorithmic composition<br/>tools. But only as fodder, a petri dish with agar-agar for things to<br/>sprout in...</p><p>&gt; My point is that SARA, despite being entirely logical, has<br/>&gt; managed to extract something of artistic value (not merely<br/>&gt; scientific value) from other composers work.</p><p>Well, I just don&apos;t agree. I think it is notes and relationships, and<br/>not much more. If you think that music is nothing more than that, one<br/>could easily be amused (or more) by SARA.</p><p>&gt; &gt; My favorite used book store is holding a Wilber tome for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which one?</p><p>Adams Avenue Books. Oh... well, they initially put aside &quot;No<br/>Boundaries&quot; but on browsing I decided to get, and read, &quot;A Brief<br/>History of Everything&quot;.</p><p>Don&apos;t you dare tell me I&apos;m wrong to have gotten that one!  :)</p><p>&gt; Oh dear! It&apos;s sad that so many people misunderstand the scientific<br/>&gt; belief system.</p><p>No worse than the sorrow I feel when I see gifted scientists<br/>stumbling about, pretending to understand music. Look, I was just<br/>having a bit of fun, but not only do you jump to the conclusion that<br/>I am totally braindead on the &quot;scientific belief system&quot; (is there<br/>only one?), but that you find it _sad_. &lt;sigh&gt; Try not to lose any<br/>sleep over it. Besides, I&apos;m not braindead, it is just a slight<br/>swelling that should go down in time...</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s precisely because I recognised that Kraig Grady<br/>&gt; was making this same mistake that I thought I should add that<br/>&gt; to my signature.</p><p>If I had noticed it was a sig I probably wouldn&apos;t have mentioned<br/>anything, really! I must have missed one of your first inclusions.<br/>That said, I wonder: is it the scientist in you that continually<br/>frames most actions or beliefs as right or wrong, in spite of the<br/>folly of absolute truth? You seem to view so many things<br/>as &apos;mistakes&apos; that need to be corrected (by you). This is an<br/>observation, not a sarcastic remark.</p><p>&gt; The main problem is that most scientists are unwilling to apply<br/>&gt; the scientific method to the _introspective_ sense, as the<br/>&gt; buddhists and others (including Wilber) have done/ are doing.</p><p>Well, Mr. Wilber will have the final say on this.
