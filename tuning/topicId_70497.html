The next set of gaps is at (-7, +38), (+8, -38), and we&apos;re getting to the point where you&apos;re going to have to use some of the more obscure accents that I&apos;m not familiar with. But you can notate a chain of 75 notes of mothra temperament with the documented Sagittal symbols and the standard 7 nominals, which is a pretty good start.</p></div>
