Bach I&apos;m practicing, that I could never really do before because<br/>of a high register E in it. Playing it as it comes, and<br/>the lower ones (and the B of the g major chord) flat in j.i. intonation<br/>sounds really nice and sweet. (May be some other Es in it too - the middle<br/>two pages have fallen out of the book and I can&apos;t find them today, and it<br/>is a while since I last tried it).</p><p>However, if one goes up to it by fifths as C G D A E then it is noticeably<br/>flat.</p><p>Quite a nice exercise to hear the effect of the 81/80 comma in practice.</p><p>Just the one fifth is enough actually - for instance it won&apos;t work so well<br/>as the E in a piece in A, at its usual pitch, and with the other notes at<br/>their usual pitches.</p><p>However, now, with the pitch bending technique I can bend the e up in<br/>pitch and get it in pitch, so it will be possible to play A minor<br/>pieces etc as well.</p><p>An eighth of a tone pitch bend up or down is practical, but can&apos;t get<br/>anywhere near a quarter tone at present (but, it&apos;s early days...).</p><p>BTW if you try the technique of blowing across the mouthpiece, then<br/>first try will just give an idea of the direction of the effect.<br/>By changing the way one does it (perhaps the angle of the breath<br/>and maybe other things, but not sure what the other ingredients<br/>are exactly) one can get a fair bit sharper than the<br/>first try, and then do the same while blowing normally.</p><p>I think perhaps the fingering I gave for E as 5/4 in lower register for<br/>descant is a bit too flat, and I was probably raising it in pitch.<br/>- if you breath all the notes in same way, then I think you just need to<br/>shade the 7th hole a bit for it.</p><p>In fact, fingering I gave it is flatter than the one for the 6/5<br/>minor third for the hexany!</p><p>Clearly one needs to watch out for this pitch bending once learnt,<br/>when devising fingerings.</p><p>Sorry about that,...</p><p>Robert</p></div>
