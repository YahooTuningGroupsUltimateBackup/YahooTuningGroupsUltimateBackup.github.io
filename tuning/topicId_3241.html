(And in a<br/>modified, and perhaps somewhat less esthetically satisfying variation...<br/>every n-tET =/&lt; 794.)</p><p>EXTRAPOLATING NUMERICAL RELATIONSHIPS OF THE I-IV-V:<br/>If the familiar diatonic major scale of 12-tET is thought of in terms of<br/>I-IV-V triads (where 1, 3, 5 + 4, 6, 8 + 5, 7, 9 (2) = 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,<br/>5th, 6th, 7th, 8th), it is seen that horizontal major thirds plus<br/>horizontal minor thirds, and vertical fourths plus vertical seconds,<br/>separate the intervallic relationships of this &apos;triad square&apos;:</p><p>1  3  5<br/>4  6  8<br/>5  7  9</p><p>where:</p><p>  1st (+3rd=) 3rd (+b3rd=) 5th<br/>(+4th=)     (+4th=)      (+4th=)<br/>  4th (+3rd=) 6th (+b3rd=) 8th<br/>(+2nd=)     (+2nd=)      (+2nd=)<br/>  5th (+3rd=) 7th (+b3rd=) 9th<br/>                          [2nd]</p><p>THE FIFTH AND THE FOURTH OF THE FIFTH AND THE FOURTH:<br/>If you take the fifth and the fourth of an equal division of the octave<br/>(where n / 12 * 7, and n / 12 * 5 equal the fifth and the fourth of an<br/>n-tET), and then take the &apos;fifth and the fourth&apos; of that fifth and the<br/>fourth... you could then call the fifth of the fifth (FF) and the fifth of<br/>the fourth (Ff) of &quot;n,&quot; the horizontal major thirds plus horizontal minor<br/>thirds, and likewise the fourth (f) and the fourth of the fourth (ff) of<br/>&quot;n&quot; could be taken as the vertical fourths plus vertical seconds where:</p><p>n/12*7=F<br/>n/12*5=f</p><p>F/12*7=FF<br/>F/12*5=fF</p><p>f/12*7=Ff<br/>f/12*5=ff.</p><p>Using the example of 12-tET (where n=12) this would be:</p><p>12 / 12 * 7 = 7<br/>12 / 12 * 5 = 5</p><p>7 / 12 * 7 = 4 &amp; 1/12th<br/>7 / 12 * 5 = 2 &amp; 11/12ths</p><p>5 / 12 * 7 = 2 &amp; 11/12ths<br/>5 / 12 * 5 = 2 &amp; 1/12th</p><p>and FF+Ff and f+ff would be &apos;4&apos;+&apos;3&apos; and 5+&apos;2&apos;:</p><p>   C (+&apos;4&apos;=)  E  (+&apos;3&apos;=)  G<br/> (+5=)      (+5=)       (+5=)<br/>   F (+&apos;4&apos;=)  A  (+&apos;3&apos;=)  C<br/>(+&apos;2&apos;=)    (+&apos;2&apos;=)     (+&apos;2&apos;=)<br/>   G (+&apos;4&apos;=)  B  (+&apos;3&apos;=)  D</p><p>THE MEAN FIFTH OF 5 AND 7-tET:<br/>Using the arithmetic mean fifth (@ 41/70ths):</p><p>3/5ths + 4/7ths<br/>---------------<br/>       2</p><p>and the arithmetic mean fourth (@ 29/70ths):</p><p>2/5ths + 3/7ths<br/>---------------<br/>       2</p><p>of the whole numbers 5 and 7 (i.e., 5-tET &amp; 7-tET) for the F and f<br/>multiples of n/12, where:</p><p>1 &amp; 5/7ths * 4 &amp; 1/10th = 7 &amp; 1/35th (12/7*4.1=~7.02857)<br/>1 &amp; 5/7ths * 2 &amp; 9/10ths = 4 &amp; 34/35ths (12/7*2.9=~4.97143)</p><p>and:</p><p>7 &amp; 1/35th = F<br/>4 &amp; 34/35ths = f</p><p>would furnish diatonic heptads with five whole steps and two half steps<br/>where W=W and h=h (when the n-Whole steps and the n-half steps are rounded<br/>to, _and taken as_, the nearest integer) on each scale degree of the I-IV-V<br/>(&apos;triad square&apos;) major scale in any n-tET =/&lt; 101.</p><p>xF*xf*12:<br/>To render any n-tET =/&lt; 794 (795-tET would render a W&gt;W where the whole<br/>number whole step 57 exceeds 56 by 1 and 27/53rds of a cent) capable of the<br/>above... You could recast the &quot;x&quot; (arithmetic mean) &quot;F&quot; (fifth) and &quot;f&quot;<br/>(fourth) of 5 and 7-tET:</p><p>(7/12 + 1/420) * 12 = ~7.02857<br/>(5/12 - 1/420) * 12 = ~4.97143</p><p>as:</p><p>(41/70 + 1/14268) * 12 = ~7.02941<br/>(29/70 - 1/14268) * 12 = ~4.97059</p><p>where 420 is derived F*f*12, and 14,268 is derived xF*xf*12.</p><p>Dan</p><p>p.s. As my methods (and no doubt means) of checking &quot;every n-tET =/&lt;<br/>101...&quot; and &quot;every n-tET =/&lt; 794...&quot; are probably more than a bit suspect;<br/>someone with the computer savvy (and the math know-how) may want (if indeed<br/>they were both interested and so inclined...) to give this some &apos;proofing.&apos;</p></div>
