When I toured the Kimball factory in southern Indiana about<br/>ten years ago they had on display an old piano.  I don&apos;t recall if it was 150 or 200 years old.<br/>But we had quite a discussion about the lower tensile strength steel they had to use to restring<br/>it to avoid damage.  Apparently higher tensile strength steel had been developed later.  It was<br/>easy to hear that it had a softer, less brilliant tone quality.  The difference was ascribed mainly<br/>if not entirely to the strings.  They also had a Bosendorfer, as the U. S. distributors, on which<br/>it was fun try those extra low tones.  I&apos;ll look this up again if not too difficult to find, but<br/>clearly (perhaps mistakenly) recall that the low harmonics are stronger than the fundamental<br/>on the lowest piano tones.  A twelve foot concert grand should have stronger bass<br/>fundamentals than a spinet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Clark &lt;<a href="mailto:caccola@net1plus.com">caccola@net1plus.com</a>&gt; 09/24 8:23 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; A few words on this subject.

In these cases, the short, stiff length of wire between the bridge and the hitch pin<br/>impairs the motion of the soundboard and bridge assembly, essentially reducing their ability to<br/>transmit the lower tones, ie fundamental. Additionally, it has been discussed on the Pianotech<br/>list by Del Fandrich that the bass bridge apron adds a distorting (and so stiffening) force to<br/>the soundboard, which serves further to reduce the tone of these fundamentals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Clark<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>______________________________________________________________________<br/>_________<br/>&gt;<br/>______________________________________________________________________<br/>_________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 7<br/>&gt;    Date: Fri, 24 Sep 1999 11:36:17 -0600<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jadl@idcomm.com">jadl@idcomm.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Project Retune: my adaptive JI methods<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 329.15 - problems playing retuned files...]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul, it sounds like you were streaming from the web.

If we<br/>&gt; play, say, D and F together, that&apos;s interval 3 starting at 2, which<br/>&gt; shows -64: pythagorean tuning does not make a good minor third.  On the<br/>&gt; other hand, E and G together are interval 3 starting at 4, which shows<br/>&gt; +16: it&apos;s tuned 5:6, which is very good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JdL<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>______________________________________________________________________<br/>_________<br/>&gt;<br/>______________________________________________________________________<br/>_________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 8<br/>&gt;    Date: Fri, 24 Sep 1999 22:40:19 +0200<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Xavier J.-P.
