Do you mind<br/>if I drop by to jam sometime? It&apos;s only a 28 hour drive.</p><p>I&apos;m guessing that since vegetables do not have a limbic system, they<br/>probably aren&apos;t feeling &quot;pain&quot; as we know it, when they become<br/>members of the Vegephone instrument. But do you think they may<br/>perhaps be a little uncomfortable? Looks like you&apos;ve got four note<br/>polyphony on this instrument. I noticed that with the Medieval tuning<br/>machines, one could possibly fine tune some interesting silent<br/>interval screams out of this arrangement (this is a riot!!!).</p><p>Sarn says: Has anyone ever tried to play musical vegetables?</p><p>There was a man here in New Zealand I saw on the Paul Holme&apos;s show who had<br/>him attach a clarinet reed to the to of cucumbers and marrows and got some<br/>really cool sounds.</p><p>It makes me think of that microtonal eggslicer againÂ…</p><p>:0)</p></div>
