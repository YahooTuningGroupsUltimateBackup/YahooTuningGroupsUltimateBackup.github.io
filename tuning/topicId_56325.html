The problem is the<br/>&gt; quality of the scan.</p><p>There&apos;s another problem with GIF--it&apos;s an 8-bit color format. Loseless or not,<br/>gif just plain sucks for serious work. Just about it&apos;s only good point is<br/>being a low-bandwidth format, and it&apos;s standard color map scheme for the web.</p><p>&gt; What you might be missing due to the unreadability of the text is<br/>&gt; that the pentagon/star thing (four of them across the bottom)<br/>&gt; represents an 11-limit hexad (otonal if upward-pointing, utonal<br/>&gt; if downward-pointing).  The point in the middle is 1, and the other<br/>&gt; identities are the vertices of the pentagon.  You can see that in<br/>&gt; a tonality diamond (at right), all the chords involve a single point<br/>&gt; in the dead center.  Whereas in the eikosany (left), the center<br/>&gt; is an empty hole.
