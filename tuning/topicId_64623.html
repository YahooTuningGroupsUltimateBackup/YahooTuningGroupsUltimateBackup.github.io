The variety called raga-malika [maalikaa = a garland], or<br/>&gt; raga-sagar [saagara = the ocean], is a set of compositions in<br/>&gt; different raga-s. This is an interesting sub-genre of Karnatic or<br/>&gt; Hindustani music, though not often included in a performance. Here the<br/>&gt; raga-s are not treated in depth. When we talk about a typical<br/>&gt; classical recital, we do not think of a raga-malika.<br/>&gt; &gt; In a raga-malika, the different raga-s -- more accurately, chiefly,<br/>&gt; the compositions of those raga-s --  are rendered in quick succession.<br/>&gt; The &apos;Sa&apos; (tonic) remains unchanged throughout the performance of a<br/>&gt; raga-malika. Only the the raga-related notes change. This is very<br/>&gt; different from anything like modulation.<br/>&gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=64624 href="#64624">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2006 5:22:57 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Whoa!
