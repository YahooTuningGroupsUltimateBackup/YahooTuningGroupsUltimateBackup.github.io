My<br/>conclusion is that, as in the 5-limit case, these sonorities are<br/>distinct, in theory and in musical practice.</p><p>While my grounding is more in medieval and Renaissance approaches to<br/>the arrangements of intervals in sonorities than to the more recent<br/>otonal/utonal approach, I do not necessarily see these approaches as<br/>irreconciliable, although they are distinct, and may sometimes focus<br/>on different nuances or shades of musical discernment. Since the<br/>question raised is framed in terms of otonal/utonal concepts, I will<br/>try to reply mainly from this point of view.</p><p>In medieval European composition (c. 1200-1420) based on a 3-limit<br/>system, the three-voice unit of complete sonority is the _trina<br/>harmoniae perfectio_ or &quot;threefold perfection of harmony&quot; (Johannes de<br/>Grocheio, c. 1300), including an outer octave plus an adjacent fifth<br/>and fourth. Note that this sonority includes all three of the<br/>stable nonunisonal concords not exceeding the range of an octave: the<br/>octave (2:1), fifth (3:2), and fourth (4:3). For example, using a MIDI<br/>notation with C4 as middle C and higher numbers showing higher<br/>octaves, here is a complete trine on D:</p><p>D4<br/>A3<br/>D3</p><p>As two other theorists of the same era, Coussemaker&apos;s Anonymous I<br/>(c. 1300) and Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325), take note, in this saturated<br/>sonority either the fifth may be placed below and the fourth below,<br/>the more smooth and pleasing arrangement, or they may be arranged _e<br/>converso_ (&quot;conversely&quot;) with the fourth below:</p><p>                   3-limit trines (8, 5, 4)<br/>                   ------------------------</p><p>       otonal                               utonal</p><p>         | D4                                 | D4<br/>         |    4 (4:3)                         |    5 (3:2)<br/> 8 (2:1) | A3                         8 (2:1) | G3<br/>         |    5 (3:2)                         |    4 (4:3)<br/>         | D3                                 | D3</p><p>    (8|5 + 4)                            (8|4 + 5)</p><p>Note that in this diagram I use the set notation (8, 5, 4) to indicate<br/>either kind of trine: this notation shows a sonority with the three<br/>intervals of octave, fifth, and fourth, but leaves open the<br/>arrangement of these elements. To indicate the different arrangements,<br/>I use the form (outer|lower + upper): thus (8|5 + 4) is the more<br/>blending and conclusive form with the fifth below and fourth above,<br/>while (8|4 + 5) is the less conclusive form with the fourth below.</p><p>From the Latin _e converso_ of Anonymous I and Jacobus, we can derive<br/>the term &quot;conversity&quot; to describe two sonorities which present the<br/>same set of intervals in different arrangements or orderings. Here the<br/>otonal (8|5 + 4) trine and the utonal (8|4 + 5) trine are<br/>&quot;conversities&quot; of the common set (8, 5, 4).</p><p>In practice, a composer such as Perotin (c. 1200) may use both forms<br/>of trines prominently, but with the more blending otonal form<br/>consistently preferred as a concluding sonority. Thus otonal and<br/>utonal 3-limit forms are indeed musically distinct in practice and<br/>theory alike.</p><p>Likewise, the 5-limit practice of 16th-century Europe is based on a<br/>complete three-note sonority which Zarlino (1558) describes as<br/>_harmonia perfetta_ or &quot;perfect harmony,&quot; and Lippius (1612) as the<br/>_trias harmonica_ or &quot;harmonic triad,&quot; a name which has stuck. This<br/>combination consists of an outer fifth divided into a major third and<br/>a minor third, e.g.</p><p>D3<br/>B3<br/>G3</p><p>As with the 3-limit trine, so with the 5-limit _harmonia perfetta_ or<br/>triad, the otonal and utonal forms are conversities sharing the same<br/>set of intervals (5, M3, m3). In the otonal form, deemed more<br/>&quot;natural&quot; and &quot;joyful&quot; by Zarlino and Lippius alike, the major third<br/>is placed below and the minor third above; in the utonal form, deemed<br/>more &quot;sad&quot; or &quot;languid,&quot; the intervals are arranged conversely:</p><p>                  5-limit triads (5, M3, m3)<br/>                  --------------------------</p><p>       otonal                               utonal</p><p>         | D4                                 | D4<br/>         |    m3 (6:5)                        |    M3 (5:4)<br/> 5 (3:2) | B3                         5 (2:1) | Bb3<br/>         |    M3 (5:4)                        |    m3 (6:5)<br/>         | G3                                 | G3</p><p>   (5|M3 + m3)                          (5|m3 + M3)</p><p>Zarlino emphasizes that the &quot;variety of harmony&quot; caused by the<br/>contrast between these two arrangements in the course of a composition<br/>is a vital musical factor; various theorists express a preference for<br/>the more &quot;natural&quot; or sonorous arrangement with the major third below<br/>at points of cadential arrival.</p><p>If we consider the harmonic series, it is interesting that the otonal<br/>3-limit trine consists of the three adjacent partials 2,3,4; and the<br/>otonal triad likewise of the three adjacent partials 4,5,6. As I will<br/>discuss in another article, Zarlino&apos;s series of &quot;sonorous numbers&quot;<br/>yields essentially the same result. Both of these forms have as their<br/>lowest note an even octave of the fundamental (2 for the trine, 4 for<br/>the triad). In contrast, the utonal trine (3,4,6) or triad (10,12,15)<br/>has for its lowest note a partial which is not an even octave of the<br/>fundamental.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
