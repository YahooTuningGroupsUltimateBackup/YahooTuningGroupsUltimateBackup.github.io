I discussed how to<br/>&gt; count the number of sets.</p><p>Steve -- if you find this thread please post an article<br/>number. I have difficulty with the yahoo search system.</p><p>I&apos;m super interested in this problem -- the only thing<br/>I&apos;ve found before now is Ramanujan &amp; ??&apos;s difficult<br/>solution to the problem of partitioning a whole number,<br/>which is related, but not the same thing.</p><p>&gt; If you are interested, I could cook up a short computer program<br/>&gt; to actually produce a table of sets for a given ET.</p><p>&gt; Polya&apos;s theorem can give us the number of sets of various sizes,<br/>&gt; but the tables could be tricky to generate.</p><p>&gt; David Bowen <a href="mailto:dmb@sgi.com">dmb@sgi.com</a></p><p>I&apos;ve got one I made that might be useful to some people.<br/>I&apos;ll append the manual to this email so that people can<br/>look at it and see if would help them.</p><p>If any of my discoveries below are helpful to anyone<br/>and not ancient news, I&apos;d appreciate being referenced in<br/>any mathematical journal articles or theses, or other<br/>work derived.</p><p>Actually, I&apos;d appreciate any feedback from the<br/>mathematically inclined among you regarding if anything I<br/>say here is new or old.</p><p>Oh, by the way, I use the example in the manual below of<br/>88cET as 8th root of 3:2, but I do know that 88cET is<br/>also 11th root of 7:4, both of which are ways I tune it.<br/>(Gary tells me he inclines towards the 7:4 view himself.)</p><p>-----------------------<br/>Mode Maker Manual<br/>(c) 1997 by X. Jeff Scott</p><p>This program determines the number of pattern-repeating<br/>scales possible from a generating set of n equal-sized<br/>intervals, called srutis for convenience in the code.</p><p>For example, 12 tone equal temperament is a 12 srutis per<br/>octave scale generating set. Various scales can be formed<br/>by selecting a subset of the tones present in the set -<br/>size 5 subsets are pentatonic scales, etc.</p><p>You can also form an 8 srutis per fifth generating set, or<br/>4 srutis per third, or what-have-you.</p><p>The number of scales, including modes (which are rotations<br/>of scales) that can be formed from a n-sruti generating<br/>set is 2 raised to the (n-1) power. This can be seen by<br/>imagining a scale as a n-digit binary number with the most<br/>significant number place containing a 1 and holding the<br/>tonic. Scales then can be represented as the various<br/>patterns of bits where a 1 in a position means that that<br/>tone is present in the scale.</p><p>Calculating the number of scales possible that does not<br/>include rotations or modes of each other is a much more<br/>difficult counting problem and I have not figured out a<br/>general formula yet.</p><p>To get around this, I wrote this command-line driven<br/>program to count and generate all the scales, not<br/>including modes that can be formed from a n-sruti<br/>generating set.</p><p>This is very useful way to generate all sets of scales<br/>possible in equally spaced generating sets.</p><p>For example, say you are working in 88 cent equal<br/>temperament, which divides the perfect fifth into nearly 8<br/>equally sized divisions. You may want to play music using<br/>scales that repeat every fifth.</p><p>Compile mode maker for your computer and call</p><p>modemaker -d -s 8</p><p>The results in the report:</p><p>A total of 1 different unitonic scales can be formed from<br/>any 8 equal-sruti repeating set.<br/>A total of 4 different duotonic scales can be formed from<br/>any 8 equal-sruti repeating set.<br/>A total of 7 different tritonic scales can be formed from<br/>any 8 equal-sruti repeating set.<br/>A total of 10 different quadratonic scales can be formed<br/>from any 8 equal-sruti repeating set.<br/>A total of 7 different pentatonic scales can be formed<br/>from any 8 equal-sruti repeating set.<br/>A total of 4 different hexatonic scales can be formed from<br/>any 8 equal-sruti repeating set.<br/>A total of 1 different heptatonic scales can be formed<br/>from any 8 equal-sruti repeating set.<br/>A total of 1 different octatonic scales can be formed from<br/>any 8 equal-sruti repeating set.</p><p>A grand total of 35 8-sruti repeating scales are possible.</p><p>To see all the pentatonic scales that are possible in this<br/>system, run modemaker as follows:</p><p>modemaker -u 88 -t 5 -s 8</p><p>This produces the result, given in terms of interval<br/>distance in cents between keys. Each key is represented by<br/>a period and the starting point is shown as an asterisk:</p><p>8 sruti repeating, pentatonic scales:<br/>*  88   . 176  . 88   . 176  . 176  *<br/>*  88   . 88   . 264  . 88   . 176  *<br/>*  88   . 88   . 176  . 176  . 176  *<br/>*  88   . 88   . 176  . 88   . 264  *<br/>*  88   . 88   . 88   . 264  . 176  *<br/>*  88   . 88   . 88   . 176  . 264  *<br/>*  88   . 88   . 88   . 88   . 352  *<br/>(a total of 7 pentatonic scales)</p><p>The source code for this program is presented here as a<br/>starting point in the land of scale generation.</p><p>The total number of unique scales from 1 to 14 sruti sets<br/>is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 35, 59, 107, 187, 351, 631,<br/>1181 ...}. This is a very interesting sequence since it<br/>starts out looking almost like the prime numbers -- a<br/>sequence that is defined as having no pattern.</p></div>
