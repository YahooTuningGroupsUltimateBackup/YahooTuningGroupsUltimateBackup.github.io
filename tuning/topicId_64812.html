I view &quot;modulation&quot; as a change of &quot;home&quot; note or a<br/>change of the relative mode surrounding a &quot;home&quot; note.  I can believe the Ozan percieves<br/>this in his CFG example, but I do not.  My feeling listening to his example is a somewhat<br/>ambiguous sense of tonic, and it is short so I don&apos;t feel sure until the end what the tonic<br/>is, and then at the end, in hindsight, I percieve the whole thing as having one mode, with<br/>some focus changes.

The drone keeps<br/>me centered, and with no change of scale in relation to the drone, I perceive no<br/>modulation.  Focusing on Ga or Re or shifting that serves only to provide more or less<br/>tension in relation to the &quot;home&quot; note of the drone, which never changes.  Maybe it is<br/>possible that someone else actually percieves the &quot;home&quot; note as changing, even despite<br/>the drone, but I have a very hard time imagining that.  Hence, when I listen to an Indian<br/>raga, there is NO modulation.</p><p>I think it can be dangerious trying to tell other people what they are perceiving.</p><p>I&apos;d like to define modulation as: the perception of a change in &quot;home&quot; note or in modal<br/>relation around that note.  Does anyone want an even broader definition than that?  It&apos;s<br/>pretty broad, but still absent (to me) in most Indian drone-based music.</p><p>-Aaron</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2006 12:44:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Try to be simple:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A recording of 3+3+2 rhythm can be percieved two ways: 1. like<br/>&gt; a 4/4 measure with syncopation, or 2. as three beats of uneven<br/>&gt; length.

It seems we&apos;ve stumbled<br/>on a difference of understanding the word &quot;music.&quot;  And while I hate to get<br/>so seemingly pedantic, I use the word to describe the human<br/>organization of sound, and you seem to be using a much more broad<br/>definition.  Do we call the billowing sounds of the wind &quot;music?&quot;  Let&apos;s<br/>stop and just say that we both appreciate and marvel at it and both<br/>understand that there is both subjective and scientificly objective occurences<br/>in this example.  We aren&apos;t disagreeing about the nature of reality, we just<br/>have different ways of using the language to talk about it.  I don&apos;t want<br/>to have that discussion.  I&apos;d be very happy if you can do as I&apos;m doing and<br/>admit to me that you understand what I&apos;m talking about even if you don&apos;t<br/>happen to like my less broad wording that I used to describe it.</p><p>In other words, my concept of modulation deals with the question of<br/>how it is perceived, because I feel that is an important question to be<br/>artistically considered in the making and presenting of music.  Certainly,<br/>you won&apos;t say that there doesn&apos;t exist variations in people&apos;s perceptions.<br/>So I&apos;m saying that being aware of how much range in perception exists<br/>is an important thing to be studied.  I&apos;m not saying to forget it all because<br/>it is all relative.  I&apos;m saying that as human beings, we do have a range<br/>of common perceptions and I care to note where we have commonalities<br/>and where we perceive different subjective experiences.  I find that<br/>and important step to understanding music.</p><p>Likewise, I love and appreciate studying the objective sciences of this<br/>issue as well.  I don&apos;t deny that objectivity exists.</p><p>In the case of the word &quot;modulation,&quot;  I truly do not know exactly<br/>what you are talking about when you claim that &quot;modulation&quot; exists<br/>objectively, outside of perception.  That, to me, implies that there<br/>is some sort of heirarchical structure of tones in relation to each<br/>other that exists scientifically, and that makes no sense to me.  It<br/>seems to me to be a particularly human trait to try to make patterns<br/>of everything and say what is the center or the most important or the<br/>order etc. etc. of naturally occuring things.  The external universe<br/>does not order importance, as importance (as I use the word) is a<br/>value judgment, and the external world doesn&apos;t hold values, it just *is*.</p><p>I can easily admit that your concept of objective modulation could<br/>exist, but I don&apos;t understand it, and you&apos;ll have to try to use other<br/>words or explain it again for me to see what you&apos;re talking about.<br/>I&apos;ll give you credit enough to assume that whatever you are talking<br/>about is valid, I just don&apos;t understand it yet, and it definitely is not<br/>the same thing that I&apos;m talking about.  Do you understand what<br/>I&apos;m talking about when I say &quot;modulation?&quot;  Meaning the way the<br/>tonic or importance of tones is perceived?</p><p>&gt; Will anyone know if a fallen tree in the midst of the woods made a sound<br/>&gt; upon impact if no one was there to hear it?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ah, but I have an answer:  It is a trick question!  This question exploits a<br/>confusion in the word &quot;sound&quot; in order to seemingly be a deep, unanswerable<br/>question!  See, the ancient word &quot;sound&quot; is not clearly defined as to whether<br/>it means &quot;our brain&apos;s perception of transverse waves through a medium and<br/>then through our ear mechanism&quot; or whether it means &quot;the existence of such<br/>waves in a medium.&quot;  In other words, sound can mean sometimes what we hear<br/>and sometimes the wave itself.  So what is this &quot;rhetorical&quot; question?  It is an<br/>expose, and exploitation, of the lack of clarity or the multi-use of the word<br/>&quot;sound.&quot;  Nothing more!</p><p>If we use the sound as perceived definition, then obviously it made no sound,<br/>as we are defining sound as that which is perceived.</p><p>If we use the sound = sound wave definition, then we&apos;d say yes it makes a<br/>sound, because we&apos;ll assume that this hypothetical situation is the same<br/>as the basic world we know, where those events do make sound waves.

I use objective wording to describe actual phenomena.</p><p>It seems we&apos;ve stumbled<br/>&gt; on a difference of understanding the word &quot;music.&quot;  And while I hate to<br/>get<br/>&gt; so seemingly pedantic, I use the word to describe the human<br/>&gt; organization of sound, and you seem to be using a much more broad<br/>&gt; definition.</p><p>Here are two bland definitions from MS Bookshelf - BRC:</p><p>1. &grave;Art of combining sounds into a coherent perceptual experience, typically<br/>in accordance with conventional patterns and for an aesthetic purpose. Music<br/>is generally categorized as classical, jazz, pop music, country and western,<br/>and so on.&grave;</p><p>(c) Helicon Publishing Ltd.  All rights reserved</p><p>2. &grave;the art of expression in sound, in melody, and harmony, including both<br/>composition and execution; (the art of) instrumental performance, as<br/>distinct from singing; the science underlying it; a musical composition<br/>(obsolete); the performance of musical compositions; compositions<br/>collectively; a connected series of (pleasing) sounds; pleasing sound<br/>generally; melody or harmony; sound of a definite pitch, not mere noise; a<br/>band of musicians (archaic); musical instruments (obsolete or dialect);<br/>written or printed representation of tones, expression, etc, or of what is<br/>to be played or sung; sheets or books of parts or scores collectively;<br/>harmonious character; fun (US).&grave;</p><p>(c) Larousse plc.  All rights reserved</p><p>This human-centric definition can be broadened to yield scientific<br/>perspectives that necessitate a cosmic organization and - consequently -<br/>underlying universal laws for the organization of sound. That&apos;s what I do. I<br/>scientize &grave;music&grave; to include undiscovered possibilities in the universe.</p><p>&gt;Do we call the billowing sounds of the wind &quot;music?&quot;</p><p>If one can mathematically express patterns in pitch and rhythm that appear<br/>to be &grave;meaningful to sentience&grave;, why not?</p><p>And since that last statement could tend to careen toward subjectivity, you<br/>can delete it altogether. It all boils down to music you like, music you<br/>don&apos;t... music you perceive, music you can&apos;t.</p><p>Let&apos;s<br/>&gt; stop and just say that we both appreciate and marvel at it and both<br/>&gt; understand that there is both subjective and scientificly objective<br/>occurences<br/>&gt; in this example.  We aren&apos;t disagreeing about the nature of reality, we<br/>just<br/>&gt; have different ways of using the language to talk about it.</p><p>Your language is greatly biased and lacking. You try to judge with emotions<br/>and perceptions, ignoring the fact that you are a biological construct<br/>subject to similar quantitative and/or qualitative physical laws.</p><p>I don&apos;t want<br/>&gt; to have that discussion.  I&apos;d be very happy if you can do as I&apos;m doing and<br/>&gt; admit to me that you understand what I&apos;m talking about even if you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; happen to like my less broad wording that I used to describe it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I indeed do glimpse where you are getting at. I simply avoid it with dread.</p><p>&gt; In other words, my concept of modulation deals with the question of<br/>&gt; how it is perceived, because I feel that is an important question to be<br/>&gt; artistically considered in the making and presenting of music.</p><p>Shall we also ask a 3-year old kid if he perceives modulation in a certain<br/>piece of music? Shall we say that modulation is relative given that %60 of<br/>the world populace is ignorant of it?</p><p>Certainly,<br/>&gt; you won&apos;t say that there doesn&apos;t exist variations in people&apos;s perceptions.<br/>&gt; So I&apos;m saying that being aware of how much range in perception exists<br/>&gt; is an important thing to be studied.</p><p>This has little bearing on the physical laws of music exemplified and<br/>explained by music theory. It is an entirely different field of scientific<br/>study.</p><p> I&apos;m not saying to forget it all because<br/>&gt; it is all relative.  I&apos;m saying that as human beings, we do have a range<br/>&gt; of common perceptions and I care to note where we have commonalities<br/>&gt; and where we perceive different subjective experiences.  I find that<br/>&gt; and important step to understanding music.</p><p>Certainly! But our lives don&apos;t depend on it. Varieties of perception of<br/>sound concern more psycho-acoustic researchers, and less music theorists.</p><p>Modulation is first a theoretical, then a perceptual phenomenon. The latter<br/>does not define the former.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Likewise, I love and appreciate studying the objective sciences of this<br/>&gt; issue as well.  I don&apos;t deny that objectivity exists.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You had said that there can be no objective music.</p><p>&gt; In the case of the word &quot;modulation,&quot;  I truly do not know exactly<br/>&gt; what you are talking about when you claim that &quot;modulation&quot; exists<br/>&gt; objectively, outside of perception.</p><p>Simply that the laws governing the music-making process must have existed a<br/>priori to our realization and discovery of their existence. Call it a<br/>Celestial Order, if you will.</p><p>Can you claim that &grave;modulation&grave; did not exist prior to human life on Earth?</p><p>The job of theory is to shed light on what already is there to begin with,<br/>and propose methods to represent on paper what is actually being performed.</p><p>That, to me, implies that there<br/>&gt; is some sort of heirarchical structure of tones in relation to each<br/>&gt; other that exists scientifically, and that makes no sense to me.</p><p>Then what more is there to discuss?</p><p>It<br/>&gt; seems to me to be a particularly human trait to try to make patterns<br/>&gt; of everything and say what is the center or the most important or the<br/>&gt; order etc. etc. of naturally occuring things.  The external universe<br/>&gt; does not order importance, as importance (as I use the word) is a<br/>&gt; value judgment, and the external world doesn&apos;t hold values, it just *is*.<br/>&gt;</p><p>There are constants and there are variables. We measure them with our tools<br/>and try to quantify them in order to correlate one with another to help our<br/>understanding. Correct measurements works all the time, so these values must<br/>have been in operation prior to our discovery of scientific knowledge.</p><p>The attributes of the universe already exist within a wholesome order. There<br/>are indeed objective values that are all important for the purposes they<br/>serve.</p><p>&gt; I can easily admit that your concept of objective modulation could<br/>&gt; exist, but I don&apos;t understand it, and you&apos;ll have to try to use other<br/>&gt; words or explain it again for me to see what you&apos;re talking about.</p><p>This is a whole new science for me. I propose it for those interested in<br/>pursuing it further.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll give you credit enough to assume that whatever you are talking<br/>&gt; about is valid, I just don&apos;t understand it yet, and it definitely is not<br/>&gt; the same thing that I&apos;m talking about.  Do you understand what<br/>&gt; I&apos;m talking about when I say &quot;modulation?&quot;  Meaning the way the<br/>&gt; tonic or importance of tones is perceived?</p><p>Not importance, sequence.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Will anyone know if a fallen tree in the midst of the woods made a sound<br/>&gt; &gt; upon impact if no one was there to hear it?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, but I have an answer:  It is a trick question!</p><p>No it is not.</p><p>This question exploits a<br/>&gt; confusion in the word &quot;sound&quot; in order to seemingly be a deep,<br/>unanswerable<br/>&gt; question!  See, the ancient word &quot;sound&quot; is not clearly defined as to<br/>whether<br/>&gt; it means &quot;our brain&apos;s perception of transverse waves through a medium and<br/>&gt; then through our ear mechanism&quot; or whether it means &quot;the existence of such<br/>&gt; waves in a medium.&quot;  In other words, sound can mean sometimes what we hear<br/>&gt; and sometimes the wave itself.  So what is this &quot;rhetorical&quot; question?  It<br/>is an<br/>&gt; expose, and exploitation, of the lack of clarity or the multi-use of the<br/>word<br/>&gt; &quot;sound.&quot;  Nothing more!</p><p>Here is a definition that almost agrees with you:</p><p>&grave;Physiological sensation received by the ear, originating in a vibration<br/>that communicates itself as a pressure variation in the air and travels in<br/>every direction, spreading out as an expanding sphere. All sound waves in<br/>air travel with a speed dependent on the temperature; under ordinary<br/>conditions, this is about 330 m&iuml;&iquest;&half;1,070 ft per second. The pitch of the sound<br/>depends on the number of vibrations imposed on the air per second, but the<br/>speed is unaffected. The loudness of a sound is dependent primarily on the<br/>amplitude of the vibration of the air.&grave;</p><p>(c) Helicon Publishing Ltd.

I do believe you are confounding serialists -- a subculture of<br/>&gt; Webern&apos;s compositional techniques -- with the 12-tone school of<br/>&gt; composing, in general. My objection to serialists, is they extended<br/>&gt; the idea of the pitch row to ALL parameters of a composition to a<br/>&gt; ridiculous extreme, thus effectively removing the composer from the<br/>&gt; musical process.</p><p>That&apos;s called &quot;total serialism&quot;, and was not a usual part of 2nd<br/>Viennese School practices. I can only think of one composition by<br/>Webern (the Variations, opus 30) where he used a rhythmic series (of<br/>only four elements)--and even then, it&apos;s not pervasive at all. He<br/>never serialised dynamics, or articulation, or anything else.</p><p>&gt; To paraphrase Arnold himself: &quot;To compose with the twelve tones,<br/>&gt; construct your row and then proceed to compose as you did before.&quot;<br/>&gt; He was certainly no advocate of serialism.</p><p>Are you kidding? I mean, literally, he&apos;s using a SERIES of pitches. Go<br/>look up serialism and come back and tell me whether someone using a<br/>tone row is not a serialist. Whether or not he was an &quot;advocate&quot; is<br/>debatable; he kept the method secret for a while, but then he also<br/>believed it would ensure the supremacy of German music for the next<br/>100 years... (I do like this quote though and I&apos;m glad you mention<br/>it.)</p><p>&gt; I keep having to point this out to you, but I don&apos;t mind: please<br/>&gt; remember that I said, &quot;after Webern&quot;. I never included Schoenberg,<br/>&gt; Berg, or Webern.</p><p>Webern died during WWII. Schoenberg died sometime in the 50s. Many of<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s compositions are thus &quot;after Webern&quot;; they are also<br/>serial, which is why you might excuse me for including Schoenberg in<br/>my defense of serialists.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m really beginning to suspect that you are a frustrated composer<br/>&gt; of pantonality<br/>&gt; I went through pretty much the same frustration during my own 12-<br/>&gt; tone phase.</p><p>Wrong, I&apos;ve never written a serial piece. My frustration is with folks<br/>dismissive of what they&apos;re insensitive to. And especially folks quick<br/>to brand something as &quot;mathematical&quot; and therefore soulless. First of<br/>all I see no reason why the mathematical should be soulless. Second, I<br/>honestly think you have no clue how a composer goes about writing a<br/>serial piece--even a piece exhibiting serialism in several<br/>dimensions--if you think it&apos;s all mechanical. The idea of a<br/>compositional system where the composer literally has no musical<br/>choices is a real straw man--who writes like that??</p><p>I have to say, my earlier reply *was* on the angry side. I had just<br/>finished defending a filmmaker I admire against someone dismissive of<br/>him, for similar reasons to yours. So I was already fired up. And the<br/>demonisation of anything mathematical is a particular thorn in my side<br/>-- frankly it&apos;s anti-intellectual. It reminds me of Soviet edicts<br/>against formalism: it&apos;s &quot;not what the people want to hear&quot;. Who&apos;s to<br/>say what will and won&apos;t resonate with &quot;the people&quot;, when there are so<br/>many different kinds of people?? Of course there is some extremely<br/>formalist music out there, that I probably dislike as much as you do.<br/>But it&apos;s not because it&apos;s mathematical in some way. It&apos;s because it<br/>*also* fails from a poetic, musical standpoint. And those will be the<br/>grounds to attack it, not the grounds of compositional method.</p><p>&gt; Nothing would please me or make me smile quite as<br/>&gt; much, as a well-composed pantonal work filled with human passion.</p><p>Then I&apos;ll recommend again the String Trio, opus 45, by Schoenberg. He<br/>wrote it as a response to the experience of being clinically dead for<br/>a short while (heart attack, revived by a shot of adrenaline to the<br/>heart, Pulp Fiction-style), and it manages to convey sheer terror,<br/>great beauty and repose, trembling anticipation -- all while being<br/>serial (in pitch) from beginning to end.</p><p>a propos of nothing in particular, I like this, that the New Grove<br/>says about Webern:</p><p>&gt; Ironically Webern, the composer who was seen by many as the originator of the hyperintellectualized serialism of the decades immediately following his death and whose own music most people found thoroughly bewildering upon first hearing, was by nature an ardent romantic who always held feeling and passion &ndash; and comprehensibility &ndash; to be important above all else in art.</p></div><h3>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;backfromthesilo@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2006 9:29:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan,  I think we may be getting somewhere!</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ozan, you miss the issue of words vs. phenomena.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly not. I use objective wording to describe actual phenomena.<br/>&gt;</p><p>While it could be seen as cocky to boldy state that one&apos;s words are objective,<br/>I see that you have that intent and please trust that I do as well.  Language<br/>can be darn confusing and putting too much emotion behind it is not very<br/>helpful in scientific or complex philisophical discussions.</p><p>SNIP<br/>&gt; It seems we&apos;ve stumbled<br/>&gt; &gt; on a difference of understanding the word &quot;music.&quot;<br/>SNIP<br/>&gt; This human-centric definition can be broadened to yield scientific<br/>&gt; perspectives that necessitate a cosmic organization and - consequently -<br/>&gt; underlying universal laws for the organization of sound. That&apos;s what I do. I<br/>&gt; scientize &grave;music&grave; to include undiscovered possibilities in the universe.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I have no problem with that, but I was using the human-centric definition,<br/>so as long as we both understand that the human-centric as well as the<br/>broader ideas both exist, then we only need to be clear which idea we are<br/>talking about.  Not everyon you talk to will easily accept using the broad<br/>definition of &quot;music&quot; but I&apos;ll bow to that version, simply because I&apos;d rather<br/>get on with the discussion instead of arguing about definitions.  And I don&apos;t<br/>have the feeling that you&apos;ll be interested in using the human-centric<br/>one, so I don&apos;t care to put up that fight.  The human-centric idea still exists<br/>as an idea.  I&apos;m not changing my mind on anything, but I&apos;ll accept for<br/>this discussion a broader defintion of the word so that we&apos;re on the same<br/>page.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Do we call the billowing sounds of the wind &quot;music?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If one can mathematically express patterns in pitch and rhythm that appear<br/>&gt; to be &grave;meaningful to sentience&grave;, why not?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And since that last statement could tend to careen toward subjectivity, you<br/>&gt; can delete it altogether. It all boils down to music you like, music you<br/>&gt; don&apos;t... music you perceive, music you can&apos;t.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I see where you&apos;re getting with this.  I&apos;m not sure how to use language<br/>to talk about it.  To me, it is useful to make a distinction between<br/>*intentional* art and natural phenomena.  That doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t<br/>appreciate both immensely.</p><p>&gt; Your language is greatly biased and lacking. You try to judge with emotions<br/>&gt; and perceptions, ignoring the fact that you are a biological construct<br/>&gt; subject to similar quantitative and/or qualitative physical laws.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Something obviously got lost in translation because my whole POINT is that<br/>I&apos;m a &quot;biological construct...&quot; so I feel it is important to recognize and<br/>understand what factors in quantitative physical laws are undeniable and<br/>specified and necessarily impact who I am and what my perceptions are.<br/>I&apos;m not ignoring that, it is a large part of my entire focus.</p><p>What I feel we cannot quantify is whether there can be &quot;meaning&quot; of various<br/>natural phenomena outside of human perception.  Other than humans<br/>qualifying things, how could all the physical existence in the world possibly<br/>have meaning?  (and no, I&apos;m not saying that humanity is what gives the world<br/>meaning, I&apos;m moreso trying to say that &quot;meaning&quot; is an illusion that exists<br/>only in the human mind).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t want<br/>&gt; &gt; to have that discussion.  I&apos;d be very happy if you can do as I&apos;m doing and<br/>&gt; &gt; admit to me that you understand what I&apos;m talking about even if you don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; happen to like my less broad wording that I used to describe it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; I indeed do glimpse where you are getting at. I simply avoid it with dread.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;m not sure what you mean or why, but that is not a very communication<br/>conducive attitude.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In other words, my concept of modulation deals with the question of<br/>&gt; &gt; how it is perceived, because I feel that is an important question to be<br/>&gt; &gt; artistically considered in the making and presenting of music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Shall we also ask a 3-year old kid if he perceives modulation in a certain<br/>&gt; piece of music? Shall we say that modulation is relative given that %60 of<br/>&gt; the world populace is ignorant of it?<br/>&gt;</p><p>The ability to recognize or quantify or name a perception is independant<br/>of having it.  To some degree, I believe a 3-year old perceives modulation<br/>even if he does not understand it.  Ignorance of what and how you are<br/>perceiving things does not mean you don&apos;t perceive them.  I&apos;m saying that<br/>the definition of &quot;modulation&quot; as best as I understand, and fitting with your<br/>definition, is based on factors outside of the simple theory that we usually<br/>talk about.</p><p>To put it another way, using my rhythm example, I think it is theoretically<br/>possible to quantify all the factors that create a certain rhythm and<br/>differentiate it from another.  I think an included factor is how the listener<br/>is physically moving.  This *can* be quantified, but cannot be determined<br/>by a score or a recording or anything musicians typically quantify.  By my<br/>way of defining &quot;rhythm&quot; it is the way in which events in time are related<br/>as per relations of accent vs. offbeat.  See &quot;The Rhythmic Structure Of<br/>Music&quot; by Cooper &amp; Meyer.  So since I have experienced a different<br/>rhythm in two different listenings of the same recording, then I can<br/>objectively state that all the necessary elements to define rhythm are<br/>not existing in a recording alone.  Therefore we must take into account<br/>more parameters.</p><p>I think modulation is the same.  There DOES exist objective parameters<br/>as to what causes a perception of modulation.  But when I use the term<br/>&quot;subjective&quot; I generally mean not that which is emotional or opinion<br/>based, or even that which is variable from person to person.</p><p>I can&apos;t find it right now, but there exists a written definition of the word<br/>&quot;subjective&quot; which means:  that which is describing the perception in the<br/>mind as opposed to the external physics.  In other words, I see something<br/>green, it is objectively reflecting certain electromagnetic waves of a<br/>certain frequency.  But my experience of &quot;green&quot; is a SUBJECTIVE one,<br/>but I am NOT arguing that anyone has any different experience, or that<br/>opinion or choice or emotion has anything to do with this.</p><p>In other words, I&apos;m trying to clarify between the experience of phenomena<br/>and the actuality of physical phenomena.  And I&apos;ve been using the terms<br/>objective and subjective.  OBjective being outside the perceiver, SUBjective<br/>being what happens internally that creates the experience.  If you read<br/>my words as meaning emotional or variable or open to opinion, then I think<br/>I may have found a major source of our miscommunication!</p><p>If you have a different way of discussing this, now that you hopefully<br/>understand my perspective, I&apos;m open to hearing it.  And if you insist<br/>on using other words, well, I don&apos;t mind- my goal is to accurately<br/>communicate, and I hope you share that.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certainly,<br/>&gt; &gt; you won&apos;t say that there doesn&apos;t exist variations in people&apos;s perceptions.<br/>&gt; &gt; So I&apos;m saying that being aware of how much range in perception exists<br/>&gt; &gt; is an important thing to be studied.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This has little bearing on the physical laws of music exemplified and<br/>&gt; explained by music theory. It is an entirely different field of scientific<br/>&gt; study.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Ok, same issue.  See I meant that these variations occur because of<br/>objective phenomena such as differences in brain chemistry, different<br/>state of being, physically, at the time of listening, etc.<br/>I find it an interesting question to discover what factors we all have<br/>in common, both biological and environmental, and where we differ<br/>and by how much, and then applicably: how does this affect variation<br/>in perceptions of music.</p><p>&gt; Modulation is first a theoretical, then a perceptual phenomenon. The latter<br/>&gt; does not define the former.<br/>&gt;</p><p>If by &quot;theoretical&quot; you mean it is just an idea, a way of talking, ok.  If you mean<br/>that it otherwise exists outside of perception, I still have no idea what that<br/>is you&apos;re talking about.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Likewise, I love and appreciate studying the objective sciences of this<br/>&gt; &gt; issue as well.  I don&apos;t deny that objectivity exists.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; You had said that there can be no objective music.</p><p>Yes, but this is using my human-centric definition of &quot;music&quot; and also my<br/>definition of &quot;objective&quot; meaning existing independant of a listener existing.<br/>Using a broader definition of &quot;music&quot; I would not say that.</p><p>&gt; &gt; In the case of the word &quot;modulation,&quot;  I truly do not know exactly<br/>&gt; &gt; what you are talking about when you claim that &quot;modulation&quot; exists<br/>&gt; &gt; objectively, outside of perception.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Simply that the laws governing the music-making process must have existed a<br/>&gt; priori to our realization and discovery of their existence. Call it a<br/>&gt; Celestial Order, if you will.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I like that!  And I agree, but by my normal way of talking, these laws didn&apos;t<br/>materialize into &quot;music,&quot; but rather people created this thing we call<br/>music and this creation became what it is because of, and is indeed<br/>governed by, these laws.</p><p>SNIP<br/>&gt; That, to me, implies that there<br/>&gt; &gt; is some sort of heirarchical structure of tones in relation to each<br/>&gt; &gt; other that exists scientifically, and that makes no sense to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then what more is there to discuss?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I understand that ORDER exists scientifically, but science cannot<br/>place value judgments, such as order of IMPORTANCE.  The physical<br/>world has order.  And it just is what it is.  Where does &quot;modulation&quot;<br/>fit in?</p><p>SNIP<br/>&gt; Not importance, sequence.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Sorry, sequence?  Please explain.</p><p>SNIP<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Our mutual communication is hampered due to the shortcomings of our language<br/>&gt; then, I&apos;ll credit you with that much!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Glad you got my point about the &quot;sound&quot; issue.  I&apos;ve been trying to say all along<br/>that these language shortcomings are an issue.  And I think they&apos;ve frustrated<br/>others on this list to the point of emotional defensiveness (on a number of<br/>topics).  It is only by recognizing these challenges that we can then work to<br/>overcome them.</p><p>My way of dealing with this is to remain the eternal optimist and assume that<br/>the people I&apos;m talking to have intelligent, thought-out, useful ideas until<br/>I&apos;m certain I understand them and their language well enough to judge<br/>otherwise.  And I&apos;m smart enough to know that just because I give people<br/>that benefit-of-the-doubt that I can&apos;t expect as much in return.  So I try<br/>to avoid getting defensive and try to avoid name-calling or anything that<br/>could come across as particularly judgmental, and try to set my sights<br/>on solving whatever miscommunication there is.  And I try to impress this<br/>upon others.  I wish I knew why so many people find it so hard to admit<br/>that there may be misunderstanding.  That doesn&apos;t even imply that they<br/>are wrong, yet so many people get defensive at the suggestion that a<br/>misunderstanding may exist.  And to be clear, I&apos;m not addressing this to<br/>anyone specifically.  I hope sharing this attitude could be of use to everyone.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Aaron</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/22/2006 9:53:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Ozan,  I think we may be getting somewhere!<br/>&gt;</p><p>We shall see!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Certainly not.

That is the illusion we are<br/>after.</p><p>&gt; If you have a different way of discussing this, now that you hopefully<br/>&gt; understand my perspective, I&apos;m open to hearing it.  And if you insist<br/>&gt; on using other words, well, I don&apos;t mind- my goal is to accurately<br/>&gt; communicate, and I hope you share that.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Have I not already?</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Certainly,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you won&apos;t say that there doesn&apos;t exist variations in people&apos;s<br/>perceptions.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So I&apos;m saying that being aware of how much range in perception exists<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is an important thing to be studied.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This has little bearing on the physical laws of music exemplified and<br/>&gt; &gt; explained by music theory. It is an entirely different field of<br/>scientific<br/>&gt; &gt; study.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, same issue.  See I meant that these variations occur because of<br/>&gt; objective phenomena such as differences in brain chemistry, different<br/>&gt; state of being, physically, at the time of listening, etc.<br/>&gt; I find it an interesting question to discover what factors we all have<br/>&gt; in common, both biological and environmental, and where we differ<br/>&gt; and by how much, and then applicably: how does this affect variation<br/>&gt; in perceptions of music.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Modus operandi, modus vivendi.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Modulation is first a theoretical, then a perceptual phenomenon. The<br/>latter<br/>&gt; &gt; does not define the former.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If by &quot;theoretical&quot; you mean it is just an idea, a way of talking, ok.  If<br/>you mean<br/>&gt; that it otherwise exists outside of perception, I still have no idea what<br/>that<br/>&gt; is you&apos;re talking about.<br/>&gt;</p><p>AFAIK, it exists independent of perception. It is ingrained in the Cosmic<br/>Scheme of things. And you don&apos;t even need to assign importance to tones in<br/>order to achieve it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Likewise, I love and appreciate studying the objective sciences of<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; issue as well.  I don&apos;t deny that objectivity exists.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You had said that there can be no objective music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, but this is using my human-centric definition of &quot;music&quot; and also my<br/>&gt; definition of &quot;objective&quot; meaning existing independant of a listener<br/>existing.<br/>&gt; Using a broader definition of &quot;music&quot; I would not say that.<br/>&gt;</p><p>But humans are not only subjects, but also objects, in that they are guided<br/>by physical laws and operate within measurable limits.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; In the case of the word &quot;modulation,&quot;  I truly do not know exactly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what you are talking about when you claim that &quot;modulation&quot; exists<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; objectively, outside of perception.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Simply that the laws governing the music-making process must have<br/>existed a<br/>&gt; &gt; priori to our realization and discovery of their existence. Call it a<br/>&gt; &gt; Celestial Order, if you will.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like that!  And I agree, but by my normal way of talking, these laws<br/>didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; materialize into &quot;music,&quot; but rather people created this thing we call<br/>&gt; music and this creation became what it is because of, and is indeed<br/>&gt; governed by, these laws.<br/>&gt;</p><p>They did not create, but did discover the relations of pitch and rhythm to<br/>give them shape. It&apos;s not as if they created music out of thin air. No,<br/>they found a vein of premordial aural treasure that they pursued for<br/>millenia in every direction possible.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Then what more is there to discuss?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I understand that ORDER exists scientifically, but science cannot<br/>&gt; place value judgments, such as order of IMPORTANCE.  The physical<br/>&gt; world has order.  And it just is what it is.  Where does &quot;modulation&quot;<br/>&gt; fit in?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; SNIP<br/>&gt; &gt; Not importance, sequence.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, sequence?  Please explain.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Sequences of tones is all you need to realize modulation.</p><p>&gt; SNIP<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Our mutual communication is hampered due to the shortcomings of our<br/>language<br/>&gt; &gt; then, I&apos;ll credit you with that much!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oz.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Glad you got my point about the &quot;sound&quot; issue.  I&apos;ve been trying to say<br/>all along<br/>&gt; that these language shortcomings are an issue.  And I think they&apos;ve<br/>frustrated<br/>&gt; others on this list to the point of emotional defensiveness (on a number<br/>of<br/>&gt; topics).  It is only by recognizing these challenges that we can then work<br/>to<br/>&gt; overcome them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My way of dealing with this is to remain the eternal optimist and assume<br/>that<br/>&gt; the people I&apos;m talking to have intelligent, thought-out, useful ideas<br/>until<br/>&gt; I&apos;m certain I understand them and their language well enough to judge<br/>&gt; otherwise.  And I&apos;m smart enough to know that just because I give people<br/>&gt; that benefit-of-the-doubt that I can&apos;t expect as much in return.  So I try<br/>&gt; to avoid getting defensive and try to avoid name-calling or anything that<br/>&gt; could come across as particularly judgmental, and try to set my sights<br/>&gt; on solving whatever miscommunication there is.  And I try to impress this<br/>&gt; upon others.  I wish I knew why so many people find it so hard to admit<br/>&gt; that there may be misunderstanding.  That doesn&apos;t even imply that they<br/>&gt; are wrong, yet so many people get defensive at the suggestion that a<br/>&gt; misunderstanding may exist.  And to be clear, I&apos;m not addressing this to<br/>&gt; anyone specifically.  I hope sharing this attitude could be of use to<br/>everyone.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Aw... what a spoilsport!

The dullest musical composers I can<br/>&gt; &gt; think of (with the rare exception), were the 12-tone<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;serialists&quot; after Webern. They followed their mathematical<br/>&gt; &gt; proclivities all the way into an obscure cul-de-sac, losing<br/>&gt; &gt; whatever audiences they might have had along the way. Their<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;rarefied&quot; number-based &quot;music&quot; aroused very little enthusiasm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, the argument by failure of imagination. So tedious. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are people (I know because I&apos;m one of them) who find<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s String Trio (for example) to be one of the most<br/>&gt; beautiful pieces of music they know.

To me, memory plays<br/>an important part, because someone with a damaged short term<br/>memory will only be able to perceive dominance on an instantaneous<br/>moment-to-moment basis.  Myself, my memory or focus or whatever<br/>is such that if I listen to a long song in a concert, I barely if at all<br/>connect the modulative feeling of the key of that song to a much<br/>earlier song in a concert, but I might relate the modulative feel of<br/>a song to the ones immediately before and after.

I mean to a degree these things are not immediately<br/>tied to reproduction, survival, physical needs or goals, etc.  Most people<br/>make a degree of distinction between these &quot;artistic&quot; goals and those<br/>directly related to fundamental survival needs and related goals.  I&apos;ll<br/>grant that this distinction can be fuzzy, but it&apos;s there in my way of seeing<br/>things.

So I&apos;d have to go with the idea that whatever the reality is, we<br/>humans don&apos;t really know or understand it, and have the human-centric<br/>desire to place human level expressive intent on the rest of the world.<br/>Suffice to say, there&apos;s no way to really KNOW the objective reality of this.</p><p>SNIP<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, you included animals, but not inanimate objects.

I&apos;m talking here about intent, and I&apos;m not claiming<br/>to know for sure who or what has such intent.  But to me, the intent is<br/>a useful distinction, even if I appreciate the unintentional as well.  I have a<br/>hard time believing there&apos;s intent in inanimate objects, but IF there is, then<br/>they fit into my definition, I just don&apos;t generally include them because I<br/>see no evidence of such intent.

I don&apos;t see why people can&apos;t accept<br/>that we humans can be intrigued and astounded by things that are<br/>random.  What possible situation in the universe could be DIFFERENT<br/>and then people say &quot;well, in THAT case it would obviously NOT have<br/>intent behind it.&quot;  It seems that whatever reality presents, people will<br/>choose to imagine intent behind it, so it&apos;s a totally circular logic.

Let&apos;s try<br/>using that definition to distinguish between art (human-free-will based)<br/>and natural beauty.

Myself, my memory or focus or whatever<br/>&gt; &gt; is such that if I listen to a long song in a concert, I barely if at all<br/>&gt; &gt; connect the modulative feeling of the key of that song to a much<br/>&gt; &gt; earlier song in a concert, but I might relate the modulative feel of<br/>&gt; &gt; a song to the ones immediately before and after.  And if I choose to<br/>&gt; &gt; imagine various things in my head while listening, I am able to change<br/>&gt; &gt; how I perceive the dominance of the notes within the same external<br/>&gt; &gt; performance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Very good.<br/>&gt;</p><p>So that makes sense to you?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; The classical definition would be to pass from one key to another using a<br/>&gt; logical progression of chords that link the two keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would attempt to describe it as constant omission and introduction of<br/>&gt; pitches that yield patterns of tonal permutation even in monody.

I mean to a degree these things are not<br/>immediately<br/>&gt; tied to reproduction, survival, physical needs or goals, etc.  Most people<br/>&gt; make a degree of distinction between these &quot;artistic&quot; goals and those<br/>&gt; directly related to fundamental survival needs and related goals.  I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; grant that this distinction can be fuzzy, but it&apos;s there in my way of<br/>seeing<br/>&gt; things.
