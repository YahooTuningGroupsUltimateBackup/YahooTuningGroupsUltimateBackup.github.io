It&apos;s clear that they&apos;re excellent, there&apos;s a large variety of tunings used, a couple dozen so far, and they&apos;re all good.</p><p>Some of the included tunings in my opinion are &quot;as good as it gets&quot;. I think Jacques&apos; &quot;spicy slendro&quot; and &quot;buzurg&quot; interpretations are flawless musical tunings for example. Obviously you&apos;d need 1,000 microscopically different versions of each to cover every ethnomusicological version so their has to be &quot;generalized&quot; versions that sound authentic, and these do sound that way, as well as being of &quot;oneness&quot; that allows for harmonic exploration as well (I suspect that this is due to differential coherence).</p><p>The real standout instruments in Ethno2, in my opinion, are the legato instruments. This has traditionally been an area where synths are far better than samplers, but these legati are great.
