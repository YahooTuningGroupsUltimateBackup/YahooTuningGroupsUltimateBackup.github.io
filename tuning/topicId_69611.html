Actually, in the very paper to which you refer, I also highly<br/>recommeded Werckmeister&apos;s Continuo temperament, exactly as I do here.</p><p>I have criticized the ubiquitous use of Werkmeister III in the modern<br/>&quot;historical performance&quot; world, because it is being applied broadly in<br/>many contexts when Werckmeister offered it as a solution to a specific<br/>problem. He himself said that it was an economic solution to retuning<br/>a 1/4 S. comma meantone organ in a passable circulating (what some<br/>call &quot;Well&quot;) temperament. He specifically pointed out that because<br/>several pipes could remain untouched, it would require less atention<br/>from the organ builder. Retempering an organ in those days was a vast<br/>and hugely expensive endeavor, since many pipes had to be physically<br/>shortened or extended.</p><p>I do indeed recommend Neidhardt and Sorge solutions for the music of<br/>the 18th century which does not work well in some sort of modified<br/>meantone, and certainly for Classical music.</p><p>The temperament I am talking about is specifically recommended by<br/>Werckmeister for continuo playing, and it is very similar to a large<br/>number of temperaments from other sources.</p><p>So there is no irony here. Perhaps you suffer from the misconception<br/>(as do many) that Werckmeister offered III as a general purpose<br/>temperament, and that he never recommended anything else. This could<br/>indeed lead you to think that there was some sort of a contradiction<br/>in my position.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t see the problem of using modern language and tools to solve<br/>&gt; old problems. It happens in mathematics all the time. The ancient<br/>&gt; greeks knew of problem they approximated by brute force that modern<br/>&gt; calculus does in a jiffy....so I guess unless one is in a really<br/>&gt; uptight &apos;authenticity game&apos;, I&apos;m with Carl on this one.<br/>&gt;<br/>What I take issue with is the judgement of Werckmeister&apos;s own criteria<br/>based upon the ideas of Owen Jorgenson. It is not that &quot;harmonic<br/>waste&quot; is a modern term, but only that the CONCEPT to which it refers<br/>represents a hypothetical disadvantage which many 16th, 17th, and 18th<br/>century musicians seemed quite happy to accept, from Schlick to<br/>D&apos;Alembert. Thus using it to criticize the structure of Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>Continuo temperament, as did Carl, has no validity. By doing so, you<br/>are not &quot;solving&quot; any &quot;old problem&quot;, you are using your viewpoint to<br/>redefine the problem in a way that comes up with a solution that you<br/>are more comfortable with.

Just what are<br/>&gt; these invaluable advances and tools which will help us with<br/>&gt; the rather simplistic problem of balancing the problem of the<br/>&gt; confilciting distributions of the syntonic and Pythagorean<br/>&gt; commas?</p><p>Logarithms are a big one, though by the end of the 17th<br/>century they could very well have made it to organ tuners<br/>in Germany.

The problem is that in order to<br/>&gt; make pure thirds the comma must be elminated over four fifths<br/>&gt; and in ordr to close the cirlce it must be eliminated over<br/>&gt; twelve fifths. If you fix C-E you&apos;ve used up your whole comma<br/>&gt; and the circle will already close (except for the schisma);<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve got nothing left to fix the remaining thirds. Thus, in<br/>&gt; purely circulating terms (elminating P. comma), any further use<br/>&gt; of small fifths beyond the first four is &quot;overcempensation&quot;.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s why 1/4 meantone ends up with the wolf fifth (and the<br/>&gt; wolf thirds, as Preatorius said); all the cumulative<br/>&gt; overcompensation, employed to produce a large number of good<br/>&gt; thirds, ends up leaving a hole in the circle large enough to<br/>&gt; drive a truck through. Modified meantones of any stripe<br/>&gt; (Froggie or German) are designed to bridge this hole, either<br/>&gt; by canceling the cumulative overcompensation with a small<br/>&gt; number of large and/or pure fifths, or, as in the case of<br/>&gt; Werckmeister and Schlick, by using wide and pure fifths in<br/>&gt; combination with fifths wider than 1/4 S. comma but still<br/>&gt; narrow enough to accumulate some overcompensation.</p><p>I think I&apos;d choose the pure fifths.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Do you grasp the concept of adaptive tuning?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yep.

You seem to be expanding this to some overreaching &quot;Baroque Ideal&quot;, which is equally silly.</p><p>The Baroque was a complex time for tuning/temperament. The biggest problem was not musical, but purely practical: the need to combine instruments made at different pitch levels in performance. Thus organists/harpsichordists where often required to transpose by 1/2 step, a whole step, or a minor third in order to accommodate the four basic pitch levels, from about 390 to 465, each separated by a half step. The lucky ones had sliding transposing keyboards/pedal boards, but all were required to be able to do it at sight. Of this there is no doubt, as there is an overwhelming amount of organological and documentary evidence. The fact the temperament theorists were struggling with it is also proved by documentary evidence. In regards to this aspect ONLY, we would have to say the &quot;Baroque Ideal&quot; was ET, the conclusion reached by Werckmeister and Neidhardt.</p><p>Problem is, organs sound terrible in ET, especially organs from then, which often had tierce mixtures. So, despite some brave attempts to use equal or circulating temperaments, the overwhelming number of organs remained tuned in 1/4 S. comma strict meantone, as the new book coming out by Ibo Ortgies based on church organ maintenance contracts will demonstrate. So in this limited sense we could say the &quot;Baroque Ideal&quot; was strict meantone.</p><p>Between these two extremes their is a world of possibilities, all matching one or another degree of the &quot;Baroque Ideal&quot;. Werckmeister presented several &quot;ideals&quot; for different contexts. Neidhardt specified 4 &quot;ideals&quot; based upon the social setting. This he did twice, altering the ideal degree of &quot;the ideal&quot; slightly, though in both cases, ET was &quot;the ideal Ideal&quot; for the most cosmopolitan setting: the court. Why? We can only speculate, though I doubt it is because sophisticated listeners preferred the sound of equal. There are many comments to the contrary, that the best players inflected sharps and flats differently. No, it was most likely because the court was the setting most likely to be visited by traveling musicians bearing their own instruments made at different pitch levels, requiring transpostion by 1/2, 1, or 1 1/2 steps by the court organist/harpsichordist.</p><p>And what are we to make of Rameau? At first he recommended a modified meantone similar to Werckmeister&apos;s, though more conservative in that it used 1/4 S comma fifths for the regularly-tempered fifths. But he later jumped clear to the other end of the spectrum, recommending ET. What was his &quot;ideal&quot;? How much does he reflect the French &quot;Baroque ideal&quot;? If everybody thought like him, then why did D&apos;Alembert recommend yet another modified meantone in the 1750&apos;s, twenty years after Rameau&apos;s ET conversion?</p><p>Nachersberg, writing at some time near the end of the 18th century (the most wide-spread publication of his work is the 1805 &apos;Gall&apos; version) said just this; there is 1/4 comma meantone (he did not use those terms but he described in such a way that there is no doubt), and there is equal, which most people find wanting because of the sour thirds. Between them there is a cornucopia of possibilities</p><p>So, if anybody is being silly here, I&apos;d say it is someone who coins a phrase like &quot;Baroque Ideal&quot;. What an utterly silly notion!</p><p>Now, about Werckmeister specifically, this particular document is one of his last, so we probably ought to give it more weight than either of the earlier two in which the infamous WIII is found. His final words on the topic, published posthumously, were that he liked equal thought he preferred a system which kept the more commonly used keys somewhat purer sounding. This 1698 temperament, when tweaked as far toward equal as the criteria will bear, satisfies that description fairly well.</p><p>But again, I think we make a mistake in assuming that Werckmeister would say their is one ideal for all situations. So I while I think this particular document may well be Werckmeister&apos;s final word on the type of temperament (NOTE: not THE temperament) best suited for continuo work circa 1700, I think it is rather silly to talk about &quot;Werckmeister goals and conclusion&quot; in any broader sense. This whole discussion began when you doubted the use of wide fifths in THIS particular temperament. That these fifths help to achieve Werckmeister&apos;s goals, whatever they may have been in this particular instance, is undeniable. He put them there, after all; the man wasn&apos;t stupid!</p><p>&gt; You seem to answer all of these questions with<br/>&gt; &quot;100%&quot;, which to me seems rather silly.</p><p>Were on earth did you get this silly conclusion?</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>Paul</p></div><h3><a id=69664 href="#69664">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2007 5:15:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Rameau ... recommending ET.</p><p>Where does he do this?</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=69670 href="#69670">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Poletti &#x3C;paul@polettipiano.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2007 10:35:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Rameau ... recommending ET.<br/>&gt; &gt; Where does he do this?<br/>&gt; I&apos;m traveling at the moment so do not have access to my archives. This is the best I can do for you at the moment:</p><p>***</p><p>In his G&iuml;&iquest;&half;n&iuml;&iquest;&half;ration harmonique (1737) Rameau endorsed equal temperament and, by way of retracting his own views of 11 years before, introduced a new argument in its favour:</p><p>    &quot;He who believes that the different impressions which he receives from the differences caused in each transposed mode by the temperament [now] in use heighten its character and draw greater variety from it, will permit me to tell him that he is mistaken. The sense of variety arises from the intertwining of the keys [l&iuml;&iquest;&half;entrelacement des Modes] and not at all from the alteration of the intervals, which can only displease the ear and consequently distract it from its functions.&quot;</p><p>Distracting the musical ear from its proper functions is an unpardonable fault in a tuning. Rameau&iuml;&iquest;&half;s argument might well have applied more palpably in France than in Germany, if French unequal tunings were, as they generally appear to have been, less subtle than their German counterparts.

There are many periods of stability within which<br/>&gt;  &gt; musicians/instrument makers/composers were quite happy to<br/>&gt;  &gt; just carry on doing what had been done.<br/>&gt; &gt; What were they, precisely? Not including 1900 to the<br/>&gt; present day, of course.</p><p>Well for one, the modern piano has changed hardly at all since about 1870. Ya, Steinway claims the have constantly improved, but it&apos;s all in really minor areas. Other periods of stability are most the Renaissance and Baroque. There were a few bursts of changes in harpsichord construction, but generally speaking, instrument makers built the same thing most of their lives. The only period of really intense continuous keyboard development is the piano from about 1770 to about 1870.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; I take it they don&apos;t use things like spectral analysis and<br/>&gt;  &gt; &gt; physical models for studying pipe acoustics?<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; How does this aide our ability to construct temperaments?<br/>&gt;  &gt; Please try to stay on point, Carl, and address the issues<br/>&gt;  &gt; within the context.<br/>&gt; &gt; If you&apos;ve read Sethares&apos; book, you should be able to guess.</p><p>Sethares has brought together the obvious in a convincing package, essentially regurgitating Helmholtz with thte trappings of modern tehcnology. This is all very good, Helmholtz needs to be repeated now and then. I think TTSS is a great book EXCEPT for his chapter on western temperament history which is completely out to lunch. His stuff on Gamelon is very good, and the idea of constructing scales based on timbre for nonharmonic tones is of course spot on.</p><p>That said, organ pipes, wind instruments, bowed strings, and the keyboard instruments used in the Baroque all produce harmonic tones. Taken as a body, they generally produce all of the first 16 or so harmonics in roughly natural proportions (saw wave). Since our harmony/scale system is also derived from the same set of harmonics, our ability to do spectral analysis of these instruments in no way offers us any improved ability to design temperaments, nor will a temperament designed by taking the spectrum of such instruments into account be radically different from anything the historical record has left us, unless perhaps it is based on a purely acoustic analysis without regard to the requirements of harmonic syntax of western music.</p><p>So I think the whole argument that we somehow have greater analytical powers is a red herring.</p><p>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; Werckmeisters monochord engravings are highly sophisticated<br/>&gt;  &gt; mathematically. There&apos;s no way we can claim his ability to<br/>&gt;  &gt; address the problem with numbers has anything to do with his<br/>&gt;  &gt; methodology and conclusions.<br/>&gt; &gt; Was he using logarithms or not? Because without them, you<br/>&gt; can&apos;t make the useful abstraction between tunings and<br/>&gt; bearing plans.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand the connection. If I want to calculate bearing plans, I do it using cents as the basic calculator, but only because it is easier to set up a spreadsheet that way. I could also do it with fractions. As the text under discussion clearly demonstrates, Werckmeister was quite aware of the most important thing for devising bearing plans: intervals tempered by the same amount increase or decrease in their beat speeds in proportion to the fraction of the interval of transposition, i.e. if C-G is tempered the same as G-D, G-D beats 3 for every 2 of C-G. This is where Jorgenson is completely off the mark, claiming nobody knew about this until &quot;modern science&quot; opened our ears. This is one of the main reasons why those who have actually gone and read old treatises in German think Jorgenson, although well-meaning, is so uniformed that his work can only be taken as the speculative ramblings of an amateur armchair musicologist.</p><p>So I don&apos;t see where your hypothetical limitation lies. Could you elaborate?</p><p>&gt;  &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; &gt; That&apos;s a different kind of adaptive tuning. I should have<br/>&gt;  &gt; &gt; said &quot;adaptive JI&quot;. Sorry. So let me repeat. Do you<br/>&gt;  &gt; &gt; consider the following scheme a temperament?: melodic<br/>&gt;  &gt; &gt; intervals in 31-ET, and harmonic intervals in 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt; By definition, a &quot;temperament&quot; is ANY system which substitutes<br/>&gt;  &gt; impure intervals for pure intervals. A JI of any stripe is<br/>&gt;  &gt; a &quot;tuning&quot;. What&apos;s the point?<br/>&gt; &gt; The point is, it&apos;s a model for the flexible intonation you<br/>&gt; keep foaming on about.</p><p>It&apos;s not my model. My model is the musicians decide who is the law, usually the Basso Continuo. The rest play in tune to the law. If the law has a bad fifth or third, he leaves it out and lets the perfect instruments intone properly. I would not attempt to quantify this process in any way. Just LISTEN, man, and play what you need to play. Who needs a system? For those who are so deaf they cannot hear, perhaps.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>Paul</p></div><h3><a id=69681 href="#69681">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2007 9:55:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; In his Generation harmonique (1737) Rameau endorsed equal<br/>&gt; temperament and, by way of retracting his own views of<br/>&gt; 11 years before, introduced a new argument in its favour:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      &quot;He who believes that the different impressions which<br/>&gt; he receives from the differences caused in each transposed<br/>&gt; mode by the temperament [now] in use heighten its character<br/>&gt; and draw greater variety from it, will permit me to tell him<br/>&gt; that he is mistaken.

The sooner you forget it, the faster you&apos;ll get to a real understanding of historical tempering.</p><p>Werckmeister&apos;s text shows beyond all doubt that people were aware that identically-tempered intervals beat at different rates depending on their position on the keyboard. There is nothing mysterious about this, and if you are paying attention, this lesson is automatic even if you don&apos;t temper. Set Pythagorean and then check the beat rates of stacked sets of major thirds. As long as all the thirds are among the wide ones, any third will beat 5 times for every four of the third below it. Now, everyone knew that these thirds are all too wide by exactly the same amount - 1 Syntonic comma - and yet they all beat at different rates. This simple fact completely destroys all of Jorgenson&apos;s rambling on this aspect, especially his laughable assertion that tuning true regular meantone was impossible because nobody knew that identically-tempered intervals beat at different rates.

Since everybody knows how to identically-temper the four fifths that make up a major third, the first step of doing meantone of any flavor, you simply divide the octave into 3 identically-tempered major thirds and then divide them each into 4 identically-tempered fifths. So you tune C-E-G#-C so that each successive third beats 5 times for every 4 of the third below it. Or you simple set them so that each beats &quot;a little faster than the other&quot;. If the progression of increase in beat speeds is more or less even, you&apos;ll get damn close even if you don&apos;t actually count the beats. A friend of mine who learned modern organ tuning in the late &apos;60&apos;s in Germany tells me this is the method he was taught. This method is self explanatory if you have a reasonable amount of tempering experience with meantone in various flavors and modified meantones.</p><p>So, take that big red book and toss it.

I should have<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; said &quot;adaptive JI&quot;. Sorry. So let me repeat. Do you<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; consider the following scheme a temperament?: melodic<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; intervals in 31-ET, and harmonic intervals in 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; By definition, a &quot;temperament&quot; is ANY system which substitutes<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; impure intervals for pure intervals. A JI of any stripe is<br/>&gt; &gt;  &gt; a &quot;tuning&quot;. What&apos;s the point?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The point is, it&apos;s a model for the flexible intonation you<br/>&gt; &gt; keep foaming on about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not my model. My model is the musicians decide who is the<br/>&gt; law, usually the Basso Continuo. The rest play in tune to the<br/>&gt; law. If the law has a bad fifth or third, he leaves it out and<br/>&gt; lets the perfect instruments intone properly. I would not<br/>&gt; attempt to quantify this process in any way. Just LISTEN, man,<br/>&gt; and play what you need to play.  Who needs a system? For those<br/>&gt; who are so deaf they cannot hear, perhaps.</p><p>Your model is pretty vague.  And it only applies to baroque<br/>music.</p><p>A bass pitch is really all baroque ensembles take from the<br/>continuo, 95% of the time.  That&apos;s it&apos;s musical function, and<br/>the rapid decay of the harpsichord and the style used in<br/>continuo playing suit that function well.  The reason the 3rd<br/>is omitted is the same reason it is omitted in jazz &apos;comping --<br/>it muddies the sound (by putting too many partials too close<br/>together... which is the role of the solo instruments :) .</p><p>As for ludditism, as I say, I&apos;m glad people are working to<br/>preserve the great discoveries of the past.  If that&apos;s ALL<br/>you&apos;re interested in, I can&apos;t help but find this a bit<br/>regrettable, but hey, if that&apos;s you&apos;re niche, more power<br/>to you.  But various statements of yours seem to advocate<br/>that others not push forward either, or worse, that there is<br/>nowhere to push.  And that&apos;s not cool.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=69698 href="#69698">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/11/2007 1:04:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The Rameau text is available online at the following address:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.chmtl.indiana.edu/tfm/18th/RAMGEN_TEXT.html">http://www.chmtl.indiana.edu/tfm/18th/RAMGEN_TEXT.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My alma mater.

For a keyboard tuning<br/>&gt; meant for all 24 keys, it makes no sense that I can see.</p><p>Before 1750 I only know of one composer who wrote interesting,<br/>listenable pieces in &apos;all 24 keys&apos; ... you know his name already. The<br/>biggest name in Baroque keyboard music was the biggest exception in<br/>the use of tonalities. The rest of the world probably had little or no<br/>reason to desire a &apos;tuning meant for all 24 keys&apos;.</p><p>Not to speak of any possible desire for obvious contrasts in<br/>intonation. See for example Scarlatti K.518: beginning in F major, in<br/>the middle he has a sequence going from A maj to B maj to C# maj then<br/>breaking off - the same music repeated in each key. What would be the<br/>point of such a sequence, if each successive key sounded about the<br/>same? (As it does in most of these supposed Bach-tunings, except<br/>possibly for Lindley&apos;s...) Whereas in one of these tunings with wide<br/>fifths it sounds amazingly audacious.</p><p>Curiously enough, even Rameau didn&apos;t suddenly start writing pieces in<br/>F# major or G# minor after he took up ET. Perhaps he didn&apos;t think his<br/>music-buying public would follow suit...</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3><a id=69720 href="#69720">ðŸ”—</a>George D.
