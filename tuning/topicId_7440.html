All I meant was that you were discussing a voicing with<br/>&gt; the third in the soprano. I simply took the triad with 9:7 major third and<br/>&gt; transposed the third so that the chord would be in, or &quot;closer to&quot; &quot;your<br/>&gt; voicing&quot;. OK?</p><p>OK.</p><p>Keep in mind that the &quot;high third&quot; phenomenon appears to occur when the<br/>third is in the middle and bottom position as well. At a recent<br/>&quot;microtuning&quot; concert at the college, a piano was tuned in JI to the key of<br/>Eb. After the show, a few of us couldn&apos;t resist going on stage and playing<br/>the root, fifth and seventh (upward from a midrange Eb in the nearest<br/>voicing) and singing the third in the &quot;empty&quot; position. Three or four of us<br/>&quot;barbershoppers&quot; agreed when the &quot;high third&quot; locked well above the JI<br/>third. However, John Schneider (my talented colleague who organized the<br/>concert) thought our tuning was simply &quot;sharp.&quot; (But then, he is constantly<br/>playing JI thirds on his microtuned instrument. What would he know? LOL Just<br/>kidding, John.)</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=7442 href="#7442">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/1999 12:58:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From me:</p><p>&gt; Just for the record, I have no mechanism<br/>&gt;  (yet) by which to know which numbers fit &quot;my&quot; major triad. &gt;&gt;</p><p>From DWolf:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You might find it useful to try to do some frequency analysis with your own<br/>&gt; computer.

Normally, the seventh in<br/>a diatonic JI tuning is not 7:4 but 9:5 or 16:9. In which case a high third<br/>would be appropriate anyway to partially compensate for the high seventh<br/>(i.e., to get the 7:5 better in tune).</p><p>When I&apos;m playing the guitar with a little distorion, and I use a tritone as<br/>a sparse dominant seventh voicing, I try to bend the major third _up_ a<br/>little so that the tritone approaches 7:5 and the combination tones imply<br/>the correct root. I&apos;d of course prefer to bend the seventh down, but you<br/>can&apos;t bend down on the guitar.</p></div>
