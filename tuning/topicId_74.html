Here I&apos;d just like to address a couple<br/>of points.</p><p>First of all, Daniel Wolf correctly noted that Xeno-Gothic is based on<br/>the tradition of European composition -- more specifically, I might<br/>add, medieval composition, with an emphasis on the 13th-early 15th<br/>centuries. He also made the vital point that in various musical<br/>traditions -- gamelan, for example -- it is musical conventions, not<br/>only scales and tunings themselves, which determine musical usage.</p><p>This last point bears emphasis. In a medieval context, I tend to hear<br/>a sonority with an outer major sixth divided into lower major third<br/>and upper fourth -- a &quot;6\3 sonority&quot; in one common parlance[1], and<br/>M6|M3-4 in my medieval-inspired notation -- as suggesting an expansion<br/>of the sixth to the octave and the third to the fifth. Thus:</p><p>f#&apos;-g&apos;<br/>c#&apos;-d&apos;<br/>a  -g</p><p>This is a property of the musical language, not of any specific<br/>tuning, and in fact this &quot;syntax&quot; can hold with various possibilities:<br/>the M3 and M6 might be the usual Pythagorean 81:64 and 27:16 (~408<br/>cents and ~906 cents); or schisma intervals at a more &quot;softened&quot;<br/>8192:6561 and 32768:19683 (~384 cents and ~882 cents, very close to<br/>5:4 and 5:3); or even &quot;accentuated&quot; septimal schisma intervals (~431<br/>cents and ~930 cents -- a Pythagorean comma _wider_ than the usual).</p><p>At least for me, this can be demonstrated by some experiments. One of<br/>the ideas of a Xeno-Gothic tuning (one form of Pythagorean 24) is to<br/>have these three kinds of options available -- and I find that they<br/>are all &quot;allophones&quot; of the same basic progression, to borrow a<br/>linguistic concept.</p><p>Similarly, using a 17-note Pythagorean tuning of the kind proposed by<br/>Ugolino of Orvieto in the early 15th century, or typically a 15-note<br/>or 16-note subset, I can nicely hear in practice that a-c#&apos;-f#&apos; and<br/>a-db&apos;-gb&apos; (the latter with schisma intervals close to 5:4 and 5:3)<br/>both expand nicely to g-d&apos;-g&apos; -- but with a difference in color.</p><p>Maybe even more dramatically, I can sit down at a keyboard tuned in<br/>1/4-comma meantone -- a tuning which compromises fifths by 5.38 cents<br/>while making major thirds a pure 5:4 -- and find that when I play<br/>in medieval style, a major third still wants to expand to a stable<br/>fifth, etc.</p><p>This is not to say that tunings are irrelevant to musical syntax: the<br/>close association between a shift in the Western European musical<br/>language during the first half of the 15th century toward a pervasive<br/>tertian texture, and the shift in tuning toward Pythagorean schemes<br/>with prominent schisma thirds, and then meantone starting by around<br/>1450, is a persuasive example.</p><p>However, it&apos;s easy to come up with examples of how styles can shift in<br/>ways that seem somewhat less obviously linked to tuning. For example,<br/>why the sonority of major third, fifth, and major sixth (the &quot;added<br/>sixth chord&quot; or &quot;6\5 sonority&quot;) should be unstable in 17th-18th<br/>century music based on meantone or unequal well-temperaments, but<br/>stable in 20th-century music often oriented toward 12-tone equal<br/>temperament (12-tet), may involve stylistic considerations not so<br/>obviously related to the tunings themselves.</p><p>One pattern, at least in European composed music, is that sonorities<br/>deemed as unstable in one era may be taken as richly stable in the<br/>next, and then as &quot;incomplete&quot; or &quot;too simple fully to satisfy the<br/>ear.&quot; Of course, this tendency may in turn have an effect on tunings,<br/>as composers and performers seek to &quot;optimize&quot; emerging or even<br/>long-recognized current &quot;concords.&quot;</p><p>Also, Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi asked about the similarity between the<br/>24-note Pythagorean scale of Xeno-Gothic and the Indian system of 22<br/>srutis. In fact, although the Indian system now uses some 5-based<br/>ratios and derivatives (e.g. 135:128), it has been appealingly argued<br/>that the system may have originally been purely Pythagorean, with<br/>schisma intervals later redefined in simpler 5-limit terms.</p><p>Arabic and Persian systems of Pythagorean tuning using, for example,<br/>17 notes, also invite citation in comparisons of this kind.</p><p>As it happens, my inspiration was from medieval European music<br/>practice and theory. On the one hand, the 17-note tunings of<br/>Prosdocimus and Ugolino in the early 15th century provided a model<br/>which I had occasion to research in the course of writing a<br/>Pythagorean FAQ now available at</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html</a></p><p>Around the same time, two threads of tuning theory came together. The<br/>advocacy by Marchettus of Padua (1318) of major thirds and sixths<br/>considerably _wider_ than Pythagorean before fifths and octaves had<br/>caught my imagination, and John Chalmers, Jr., pointed out to me that<br/>the Pythagorean series of fifth can approximate not only 5-limit but<br/>7-limit intervals. I soon put these trains of thought together, and<br/>realized that another way of viewing the near-7-limit intervals -- for<br/>example, M3 and M6 a comma wider than the usual Pythagorean forms --<br/>was as &quot;Marchettan&quot; cadential intervals with extra harmonic tension<br/>and supernarrow leading tones.</p><p>Curiously, after I had formulated this basic idea for a 24-note<br/>tuning, a scholar called to my attention that the scheme was in fact<br/>very similar to the Indian srutis (especially if one posits an<br/>original Pythagorean version with all intervals 3-based), the Persian<br/>17-note scheme, and so on.</p><p>Of course, the content of a music depends on more than the general<br/>scheme of tuning -- Arabic, Persian, Indian, and medieval European<br/>music all have their own styles and ways of using Pythagorean or<br/>quasi-Pythagorean intervals.</p><p>Having attempted a reply to some of the helpful comments and<br/>questions, I warmly thank people such as Daniel Wolf and Eduardo<br/>Sabat-Garibaldi for their interest and hope that this post may explain<br/>some of the motivations for my &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; scheme, as well as<br/>illustrate the way in which tuning concepts can have striking<br/>cross-cultural analogues.</p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. One complication of communication in ASCII, or even in a typeset<br/>medium, is that the symbol &quot;6/3&quot; can mean either &quot;a continuo symbol<br/>for a six-three chord, with a third and sixth above the lowest note&quot;<br/>or &quot;a tuning ratio of 6:3.&quot; One possible solution in ASCII is to use a<br/>backslash for the first meaning, as I have done here.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
