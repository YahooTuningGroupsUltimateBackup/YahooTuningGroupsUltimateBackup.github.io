That I allegedly don&apos;t know how to compose, tune for, or play a piece for the enjoyment and soothing of my own young daughter?   That my allegedly &quot;all to much over-broade 5th&quot; (merely 704 cents!) is supposedly some stupid flaw that ruins my musicianship and more?</p><p>Have you bothered to listen to the recordings of it, demonstrating how the key of B major really sounds in its expressive resources as contrasted against B-flat major?<br/><a href="http://home.ntelos.net/~bpl/hpsi/afton-lullaby-b.mp3">http://home.ntelos.net/~bpl/hpsi/afton-lullaby-b.mp3</a><br/><a href="http://home.ntelos.net/~bpl/hpsi/afton-lullaby-bflat.mp3">http://home.ntelos.net/~bpl/hpsi/afton-lullaby-bflat.mp3</a></p><p>Can you even *hear* in normal tonal music such as that, where the &quot;over-broade&quot; 5th is?  Or are you just objecting on paper (and/or in your imagination) to the idea of having one in there at all?</p><p>For what it&apos;s worth, the lullaby I composed for her younger sibling is in five flats, to contrast with this one in five sharps.  And I play it in the same tuning, usually.  I haven&apos;t recorded it yet or put it up anywhere, because my wife hasn&apos;t finished the words yet.  But just like the first one, it&apos;s supposed to be a pleasant little lullaby to comfort an upset child into sleep.  We hum it all the time and it works.  My music has nothing to do with 17-EDO or any other n-EDO; just a bit of diatonic pleasure for young children.</p><p>So, in all this: what is your point, if indeed you have one, beyond stalking me with public insults and belittling my work?</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div>
