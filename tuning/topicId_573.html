<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>JI vs.equal temp</h1><h3><a id=573 href="#573">ðŸ”—</a>Neil Haverstick &#x3C;stick@uswest.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/29/1999 5:02:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry, I don&apos;t remember who put the post about preferring JI music<br/>to eq music...I am somewhat amazed that people think that way. As others<br/>have pointed out, is the music more important than the tuning? Or vice<br/>versa? Or, does it matter? Fact is, it has been mentioned that purely<br/>tuned intervals affect the body and nervous system in a different way<br/>than tempered intervals, because of the way the Universe is<br/>designed...Danielou mentions this in his book, and it makes a lot of<br/>sense to me that this is so. Of course, and again, others have pointed<br/>this out, if a poor composer writes a piece in JI, is it worth listening<br/>to just because of the tuning? Not to me, it isn&apos;t. There has been much<br/>superb music written in 12 eq, as we all know...most of us on this list<br/>grew up listening to lots of 12 eq stuff, and it is (obviously) still<br/>the dominant sound in our culture. For whatever reason, there is not<br/>nearly the quantity of great JI music compared to eq music...perhaps<br/>that will change as more folks develop composing/performing skills on JI<br/>instruments. A tuning must be used to create profound music...otherwise,<br/>it remains in the realm of the abstract, fun to talk about, but music is<br/>meant to be heard and experienced.<br/>    Also, I love chord based music, including Bach, Bartok, Coltrane,<br/>Parker, blues, country, bluegrass, flamenco, etcetc. Maybe someone will<br/>figure out how to write complex chordal music of the level of Bartok&apos;s<br/>Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta in JI...that would be<br/>great..As of now, I have heard little JI music that yet remotely<br/>compares to such masterpieces...and the 12 eq literature is chock full<br/>of incredible music for hundreds of years; again, that would be great if<br/>such JI masterworks appear (and I do know there are some great JI<br/>musicians out there). At this point, I feel the level of JI music<br/>composition/performance, is not up to the level of JI theories...and, on<br/>this forum, there are many brilliant theorists, and I am grateful to<br/>have learned from them. My suggestion to JI enthusiasts is to practice<br/>and study the arts of composing and performing, which are not the same<br/>as theorizing about scales and tunings...when the many great JI theories<br/>result in more great JI music, that will be an important day for the art<br/>of music in general.<br/>   One more thing...if one prefers JI music over eq music, does that<br/>include all eq temps, or just 12eq? For example, 34 eq is much closer<br/>(in many ways) to the harmonic series than 12 is...31, 53, and others<br/>are also more harmonius in significant ways...it seems like an<br/>interesting and ongoing discussion...which is what it&apos;s all about,<br/>anyway...Hstick (PS...what about Pythagorean or spiral of 5ths based<br/>tunings...are they in or out? How about gamelan music, which is way off<br/>of the harmonic series? And, if one wants to listen to purely tuned<br/>music of the highest order, there are many great Indian musicians who<br/>routinely play in these systems)</p></div>
