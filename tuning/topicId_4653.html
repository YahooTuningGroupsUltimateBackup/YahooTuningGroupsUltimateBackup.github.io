If &gt;there is<br/>no drone, the just noticable difference for pitch is about 8 &gt;cents.</p><p>The source for my above assertion is _Psychology of Music_ by Carl Seashore,<br/>pp. 56-62, McGraw-Hill 1938.  First, he defines the standard test for pitch<br/>discrimination as having a stimulus of &quot;sound[ing] two notes, each of which is<br/>one second in duration but differing in pitch and separated by a very short<br/>interval of time&quot;.  He cites a study by Strucker, Zsch. Sinnesphysiol., XLII,<br/>1908, where the pitch discrimination of 16 professional musicians in the Royal<br/>Opera in Vienna was measured (at 435 Hz).  Four of the subjects discriminated<br/>less than one cent, and five others within two cents (one cent at 435 Hz is<br/>very nearly 0.25 Hz).  Figure 1, page 60, also shows that pitch discrimination<br/>is actually about twice as fine at 2000 Hz as for 435 Hz.</p><p>Fred Reinagel</p><p>____________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your own FREE, personal Netscape WebMail account today at <a href="http://webmail.netscape.com">http://webmail.netscape.com</a>.</p></div>
