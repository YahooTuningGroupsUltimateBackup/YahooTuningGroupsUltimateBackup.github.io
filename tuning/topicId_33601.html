How is it?<br/>&gt;</p><p>*****Hello Antonio!</p><p>Yes, I have seen this book.  It&apos;s been out for several years now. I<br/>know Sam Adler well and, in fact, have worked briefly with him.  I&apos;m<br/>sure you can&apos;t go wrong with this book although, personally, I still<br/>recommend the older standard on the topic:  the book _Orchestration_<br/>by Walter Piston.</p><p>I believe you are correct when you say that most of these books<br/>basically cover the same material... instrumental ranges and so forth.</p><p>&gt; Does anybody know his publication:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The study of Orchestration (which has tapes and seems to be very<br/>&gt; constructive/ I don&apos;t know about CDs availability?) ($85)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are these 2 publications complementary and a good set to cover the<br/>subject, or they repeat the same things? If they repeat<br/>things  ,which one is better?</p><p>****I don&apos;t know this latter &quot;interactive&quot; work.  It might be<br/>valuable, but nothing, of course, will substitute for writing pieces<br/>and working *directly* with players.  In fact, believe it or not, the<br/>study of *orchestration* is best facilitated *not* by writing<br/>orchestral pieces (where, in *my* experience almost *everything*<br/>sounds glorious, even a major triad or a unison... :) ) but in *solo*<br/>pieces, where the *real* strengths and weaknesses of traditional<br/>instruments are revealed.</p><p>There is *also* a book that I own by Cecil Forsyth called, again,<br/>_Orchestration_.  Again, it covers just about the same material:<br/>range of instruments, *some* possible effects, generally not many...</p><p>This work has an introduction by Bill Bolcom (somebody I *also* have<br/>worked with...) and it&apos;s only $13.95  (!)  Well, *now* it&apos;s probably<br/>$20, but still...</p><p>&gt; Do they cover microtonality?<br/>&gt;</p><p>****To my knowledge *none* of these books cover microtonality, with<br/>the exception, possibly, of the limits of &quot;glissandi&quot; and so forth on<br/>the trombone, etc.</p><p>In order to have a book covering *orchestration* and microtonality,<br/>it would have to include *fingering charts* for alternate tunings.<br/>None of these books have that.</p><p>About the only book around that has this is the famous _New Sounds<br/>for Woodwind_ by Bruno Barotolozzi, which is, I believe, no longer in<br/>print, but you can probably find it in the library.</p><p>And, there is Johnny Reinhard&apos;s _Pitch_ Vol. 1 #4 which has quite a<br/>few fingerings, but presented in a fascinating but &quot;ideosyncratic&quot;<br/>manner by several performers who presented the material to the<br/>magazine.</p><p>There is *much* work to be done.  I would like, personally, to have<br/>fingering charts for the &quot;Blackjack&quot; scale in 72-tET for *all* the<br/>woodwinds, for example.  This material has yet to be assembled and<br/>standardized... (by &quot;standardized&quot; I just mean presented in a readily-<br/>usable form...)</p><p>&gt; What  book is good (&amp;updated) for Ochestration in general?<br/>&gt; What book is good for Orchestration and microtonality?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was adviced an old publication by... Reed Gardener!<br/>&gt;</p><p>****I&apos;ve seen this book, but I can&apos;t remember much about it.  I<br/>sincerely doubt, though, that there is much, if anything, in it about<br/>microtonality.  If there is and you see it in the library, please let<br/>me know.</p><p>&gt; Please tell me about your experience!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J.A.M.Salinas</p><p>****So the Adler will be fine -- but don&apos;t expect Adler to be very<br/>sympathetic to microtonality!  He&apos;s quite a *conservative* composer<br/>and teacher!</p><p>I still use the &quot;old&quot; Piston.  Walter Piston really came up with a<br/>good book with _Orchestration_.  His _Harmony_ book has *much* to be<br/>desired, and his _Counterpoint_ is only &quot;so so...&quot;</p><p>And the Forsyth is an inexpensive paperback from Dover that covers,<br/>essentially, the same material.</p><p>But the &quot;interactive&quot; one I haven&apos;t seen or heard... but, again,<br/>nothing beats *direct* work with players.</p><p>Regarding microtonality, though, all of these publications are<br/>concerned entirely with *traditional* instruments and the assumptions<br/>are that people are performing in 12-tET, so you have to find *other*<br/>references like the Bartolozzi or Reinhard if you want to explore the<br/>xenharmonic universe.</p><p>Otherwise, such an orchestration book has yet to be written!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=33615 href="#33615">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>2/3/2002 8:01:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Actually, I used Keenan&apos;s &quot;Orchestration&quot; and though it is conservative as<br/>are most, it is clear cut, short, and easy to use.  An example of<br/>conservative treatment is when the actual ranges of instruments are shortened<br/>&quot;to be safe.&quot;  Also, virtuosi can do most of what books say cannot.  For<br/>example, the bassoon is described as having no dynamic range in its lowest<br/>tetrachord (not true for me).  Also, certain trills in the lowest tetrachord<br/>are described as impossible (but not true for me).</p><p>The tuning charts in PITCH I:4 were all that were available at the time they<br/>were published.  The Bartolozzi book was dead wrong in its fingerings,<br/>especially for flute (much to the disappointment of Toru Takemitsu when he<br/>printed Bartolozzi fingerings for his flute solo &quot;Voice&quot;).</p><p>Actually, Bartolozzi was a bassoonist/composer who studied with a bassoonist<br/>named Muchetti who is credited with the first serious Italian exploration of<br/>microtonal bassoon (largely in multiphonics).

He first contacted me (by phone, at what was around 3 a.m. in<br/>the U.K.) because he had read my Xenharmonikon article (c. 1976) on<br/>possibilities for microtonal brass instruments.  (This was also the<br/>event which first awakened me out of my microtonal slumber, so if you<br/>happen to read this, thank you Patrick!)</p><p>I strongly feel that logical technology would free the woodwind<br/>instruments from the severe limitations imposed by physical linkages<br/>and would simultaneously simplify fingerings and optimize tone<br/>quality.  On the clarinet, oboe, and bassoon in particular (which<br/>have relatively small tone holes compared to the size of the<br/>instrument), I could envision being able to change the instrument<br/>from 31-EDO to 41-EDO (for example) with the flick of a switch.  It<br/>would also be possible to build an instrument without having to<br/>decide in advance what the fingerings will be -- you could program<br/>these via a computer interface and test them out.  In case a<br/>difference of opinion might arise as to the best fingering system,<br/>production instruments could have more than one set of fingerings<br/>built in, selectable by means of a switch.  Patrick reports that this<br/>sort of technology has already been tested (to a limit extent), and<br/>it has elicited some very favorable reactions from the players<br/>involved.</p><p>&gt; I think it would be much easier to effect such xenharmonics in some<br/>&gt; kind of &quot;post processing&quot; which he also mentions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or perhaps, even more practically, what the fine composer Jonathan<br/>&gt; Harvey does... puts all the xenharmonics in the *electronic* part<br/>and<br/>&gt; uses *conventional* instruments.

But, there are real limitations in<br/>&gt; acoustic instruments... I&apos;ll bet Kraig Grady will agree on that...<br/>&gt; dunno.  But even Harry Partch really standardized everything. He<br/>&gt; *had* to in order to get all his instruments in sync.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, with those two methods possibly, just *possibly* there can be<br/>new<br/>&gt; development of new acoustic instruments.  Otherwise no<br/>manufacturers<br/>&gt; or individuals are going to spend the time and money to do it.</p><p>I have already mentioned the woodwinds in connection with 31 and 41-<br/>EDO.  Why 31 and 41?  These are arguably the best negative and<br/>positive EDO&apos;s for approximating small-number ratios, and, given that<br/>72 would not be anywhere nearly as practical, together they would<br/>afford a considerable amount of versatility.</p><p>Why EDO&apos;s?  You asked that question below, but I will give an answer<br/>here.  The orchestral instruments are, for the most part, flexible-<br/>pitch instruments.  If the player can control the intonation, then<br/>why design an instrument based on just or near-just intonation, when<br/>it only presents other problems, such as:</p><p>*** What set of tones does one select?  How many tones, and how much<br/>modulation will they allow?  To what harmonic limit?  Why?  And if I<br/>don&apos;t like your answers, then what?</p><p>Since EDO&apos;s provide free modulation, they are the most flexible<br/>standard for flexible-pitch instruments.</p><p>I also mentioned brass instruments.  Within the past couple of years<br/>I completely rethought my original brass proposal and discarded it in<br/>favor of a completely new approach that does the same thing for the<br/>brass instruments that the Bosanquet keyboard could do for<br/>synthesizers (and did for the Scalatron) or that the sagittal symbols<br/>can do for notation: My new approach employs easy-to-learn fingerings<br/>that partially build on existing (12-EDO) patterns and carry over<br/>from one tonal system to another.  This can be implemented in multi-<br/>system brass instruments that would allow a player to have 17, 19,<br/>22, 24, 31, 36, and 41-EDO (and perhaps others) all in a single four-<br/>valve instrument.  I need to emphasize that these are not<br/>hypothetical instruments; I&apos;ve done the math on the tube lengths, and<br/>it can all be done with mechanical valves.  (Patrick has been<br/>pursuing the use of electrically controlled valves lately, and if<br/>that will offer any significant advantage in cost or reliability,<br/>then that could be a  possibility.)</p><p>With a multi-system instrument the player would not be locked into a<br/>single tonal system upon making a purchase, would not incur any<br/>adverse financial consequences upon a change of mind about that<br/>system, and would not have to carry more than one instrument to a<br/>performance to play in different systems.  Likewise, the manufacturer<br/>would not have to produce separate models for different tonal systems<br/>(as if that would happen anyway!), thus giving the convertible<br/>instruments the widest possible market, i.e., the entire microtonal<br/>community (which is small enough as things go).</p><p>Does this sound like the sort of &quot;standard&quot; that might appeal to you<br/>or anybody else out there?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; There also has to be a *demand* for such.  Ozzard-Low does mention<br/>&gt; this aspect... he touches on just about everything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One can only have a *demand* if things are limited and not &quot;all<br/>over<br/>&gt; the place...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Suddenly it has to be &quot;in vogue&quot; to have a just guitar, or a 19-<br/>tone<br/>&gt; guitar, whatever.</p><p>Both Patrick and Harry Partch gave the same answer to this question.<br/>The one (and probably only) thing that is going to put microtonality<br/>in demand is to have some significant microtonal music come into<br/>existence.  Whether it might be the sort of instant success that<br/>would accomplish what &quot;Switch-on Bach&quot; did for electronic music, or<br/>whether it would more likely be a significant cumulative body of work<br/>of a group of talented people, it&apos;s ultimately up to those of us who<br/>consider ourselves microtonal composers to compose something<br/>significant.  Short of that, I don&apos;t think we have a prayer.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I still don&apos;t quite understand Patrick Ozzard-Low&apos;s predilection<br/>for<br/>&gt; ETs.  He mentions the concept of &quot;consistency&quot; that, apparently<br/>Paul<br/>&gt; Erlich invented or helped to invent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are ETs more &quot;consistent&quot; generally than irregular scales.<br/>Maybe. ??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, Ozzare-Low seems to like them better.

What we are using today has been in general use<br/>for a relatively short time; and what we will use in the future does<br/>not have to be what we are using today.</p><p>I hope this contributes a little more perspective on what we are<br/>attempting to do.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=33671 href="#33671">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2002 1:04:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I have already mentioned the woodwinds in connection with 31 and 41-<br/>&gt; EDO.

A clarinet and a<br/>flute and a bassoon and an oboe can all play microtones with conviction, and<br/>do.  Below is a small list of wind players:</p><p>On flute: Stefani Starin (Newband) plays deliciously in JI.  Andrew<br/>Bolotowsky can play any tuning system.  I&apos;ve hired numerous flute players<br/>(over 20) in a lifetime and was never a problem for them to play precise<br/>microtones.  Accordingly,  play microtonal recorder in any tuning.</p><p>On clarinet: Michiyo Suzuki can play, and does play, anything.  Anyone could<br/>if they tried.</p><p>On bassoon: Yup bassoon out of tune for 1851 Berlioz, but now able to play in<br/>any tuning of any kind using different fingering combinations -- or<br/>&quot;grippings.&quot;  All bassoonists are using my fingerings.  Enough with the old<br/>canard about the fingerings being so different from one player to another.<br/>Usually only one or a few are slightly different.</p><p>On oboe:  Admiringly, no one has taken the reins more than Heinz Holliger,<br/>himself.  There is no doubt that the specificity is there, as soon as an<br/>oboist can imagine the notes in his head correctly.  This is a treasure trove<br/>for multiphonic extremes thanks to the ease of changing multiphonics, and the<br/>ease to circular breathe on oboe.</p><p>On horn:  Greg Evans can play in any tuning with authority and suave<br/>(presently teaching in New Mexico).  He has raised the bar.</p><p>On trombone:  Julie Josephson and Chris Washburne has proved that they hear<br/>everything...and can play it repeatedly.</p><p>On tuba: Dave Grego with his quartertone tuba has played everything I can<br/>throw at him (check him in my piece &quot;Atlantis&quot;).</p><p>Strings:  Tom Chiu, Dave Eggar, Matt Fields...these guys eat college<br/>professors for breakfast.  There is no comparison between what they are<br/>playing and what people are teaching...light years apart.</p><p>Percussion: natural microtonal citizens in their genesis.</p><p>Vocals?

On the clarinet, oboe, and bassoon in particular (which<br/>&gt; have relatively small tone holes compared to the size of the<br/>&gt; instrument), I could envision being able to change the instrument<br/>&gt; from 31-EDO to 41-EDO (for example) with the flick of a switch.  It<br/>&gt; would also be possible to build an instrument without having to<br/>&gt; decide in advance what the fingerings will be -- you could program<br/>&gt; these via a computer interface and test them out.  In case a<br/>&gt; difference of opinion might arise as to the best fingering system,<br/>&gt; production instruments could have more than one set of fingerings<br/>&gt; built in, selectable by means of a switch.  Patrick reports that<br/>this<br/>&gt; sort of technology has already been tested (to a limit extent), and<br/>&gt; it has elicited some very favorable reactions from the players<br/>&gt; involved.</p><p>****Hello George!</p><p>Well, certainly I&apos;m not trying to &quot;diss&quot; this technology.  I was just<br/>thinking it might be easier to use &quot;regular&quot; fingerings with some<br/>kind of MIDI post-processing to obtain xenharmonics rather than a<br/>*physical* electronic interface that one plays and which goes to a<br/>computer and comes back to *physically* play an instrument.</p><p>Maybe it can be done!  Dunno.  I would just like to see one of these<br/>gadgets in action!  More power to anybody who can get it to work!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have already mentioned the woodwinds in connection with 31 and 41-<br/>&gt; EDO.  Why 31 and 41?  These are arguably the best negative and<br/>&gt; positive EDO&apos;s for approximating small-number ratios, and, given<br/>that  72 would not be anywhere nearly as practical, together they<br/>would afford a considerable amount of versatility.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****But how about our beloved &quot;Miracle&quot; scales... Blackjack 21 and<br/>Canasta 31!

You asked that question below, but I will give an<br/>answer here.  The orchestral instruments are, for the most part,<br/>flexible-pitch instruments.  If the player can control the<br/>intonation, then why design an instrument based on just or near-just<br/>intonation, when it only presents other problems, such as:<br/>&gt;<br/>What set of tones does one select?  How many tones, and how much<br/>modulation will they allow?  To what harmonic limit?  Why?  And if I<br/>don&apos;t like your answers, then what?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since EDO&apos;s provide free modulation, they are the most flexible<br/>&gt; standard for flexible-pitch instruments.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****Thanks, George.  I guess that would work, but somehow the<br/>insistence on ETs turns my stomach...  :)  Too many identical little<br/>steps!  :)  But your answer is a bit what I imagined... although I<br/>also thought it might have something to do with Paul<br/>Erlich&apos;s &quot;consistency&quot; but maybe it doesn&apos;t.</p><p>Paul?  Are ETs, in general, more &quot;consistent?&quot;  or does it depend...</p><p>&gt; I also mentioned brass instruments.  Within the past couple of<br/>years I completely rethought my original brass proposal and discarded<br/>it in favor of a completely new approach that does the same thing for<br/>the brass instruments that the Bosanquet keyboard could do for<br/>&gt; synthesizers (and did for the Scalatron) or that the sagittal<br/>symbols can do for notation: My new approach employs easy-to-learn<br/>fingerings that partially build on existing (12-EDO) patterns and<br/>carry over from one tonal system to another.  This can be implemented<br/>in multi-system brass instruments that would allow a player to have<br/>17, 19, 22, 24, 31, 36, and 41-EDO (and perhaps others) all in a<br/>single four-valve instrument.  I need to emphasize that these are not<br/>&gt; hypothetical instruments; I&apos;ve done the math on the tube lengths,<br/>and it can all be done with mechanical valves.  (Patrick has been<br/>&gt; pursuing the use of electrically controlled valves lately, and if<br/>&gt; that will offer any significant advantage in cost or reliability,<br/>&gt; then that could be a  possibility.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>****That sounds, *terrific* George, if you can get it working!</p><p>&gt; With a multi-system instrument the player would not be locked into<br/>a single tonal system upon making a purchase, would not incur any<br/>&gt; adverse financial consequences upon a change of mind about that<br/>&gt; system, and would not have to carry more than one instrument to a<br/>&gt; performance to play in different systems.  Likewise, the<br/>manufacturer would not have to produce separate models for different<br/>tonal systems (as if that would happen anyway!), thus giving the<br/>convertible instruments the widest possible market, i.e., the entire<br/>microtonal community (which is small enough as things go).<br/>&gt;</p><p>****That sounds absolutely great!  Perhaps that involves inserting<br/>different &quot;crooks&quot; or such like.  (I don&apos;t mean Enron...)</p><p>If so, it becomes a little like the &quot;olden days&quot; when different<br/>crooks were inserted to obtain different &quot;keys&quot;... maybe.</p><p>&gt; Does this sound like the sort of &quot;standard&quot; that might appeal to<br/>you or anybody else out there?<br/>&gt;</p><p>****Why, of course, but I should also add that there is much to be<br/>done, particularly in the area of JUST INTONATION (cult caps) with<br/>brass instruments.  For example, I wrote a couple of pieces for the<br/>Belgian horn virtuoso Francis Orval where he uses *all* the harmonics<br/>from different positions in the series.  Of course, there are<br/>*normally* very few of these used, just the ones that are closest to<br/>12-tET. Orval came up with a marvelous chart of *all* these overtones<br/>which was included in Johnny Reinhard&apos;s magnificent _Pitch_ Vol 1 #4<br/>that Patrick Ozzard-Low mentions several times in his study.  So,<br/>there&apos;s even a *lot* of microtonality to be done with *conventional*<br/>brass instruments!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Both Patrick and Harry Partch gave the same answer to this<br/>question.  The one (and probably only) thing that is going to put<br/>microtonality in demand is to have some significant microtonal music<br/>come into existence.  Whether it might be the sort of instant success<br/>that would accomplish what &quot;Switch-on Bach&quot; did for electronic music,<br/>or whether it would more likely be a significant cumulative body of<br/>work of a group of talented people, it&apos;s ultimately up to those of us<br/>who consider ourselves microtonal composers to compose something<br/>&gt; significant.  Short of that, I don&apos;t think we have a prayer.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****Absolutely!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; A primary purpose of the paper is to secure funding for what is<br/>&gt; admittedly a highly ambitious project, and in endeavoring to convey<br/>a vision of what should be the future of music, I think that Patrick<br/>&gt; felt that it was useful to show that musical tuning has a varied<br/>and illustrious past.  What we are using today has been in general<br/>use for a relatively short time; and what we will use in the future<br/>does not have to be what we are using today.</p><p>*****You know, George, I wasn&apos;t thinking about the fact that this<br/>paper was to be sent to *funding sources!*  Of course, that explains<br/>the &quot;recap&quot; and also the tone of the paper!  Good luck!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope this contributes a little more perspective on what we are<br/>&gt; attempting to do.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****It absolutely does, and I found the entire thing engrossing.

It may even be that you could<br/>pitch-bend for the quommas with a consistent timbre.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=33699 href="#33699">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2002 11:27:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; By the way, in my valve plan, the first and second valves do<br/>&gt; exactly<br/>&gt; &gt; the same thing they do now, which is to lower the pitch by a<br/>major<br/>&gt; &gt; 2nd and minor 2nd, respectively, so that the great majority of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; fingerings previously learned carry right over to the microtonal<br/>&gt; &gt; instrument, which is not bad for carrying over one&apos;s existing<br/>&gt; &gt; training.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but what i was referring to, george, is the fact that the interval<br/>&gt; that the two valves together lower the pitch by, is not exactly the<br/>&gt; sum of the intervals that the two valves separately lower the pitch<br/>&gt; by. i was just wondering if you were taking this effect into<br/>account,<br/>&gt; and how.</p><p>The shortfall in tube length caused by the addition of the first and<br/>second valves is not enough to cause a serious problem (maximum<br/>departure of 5.0 cents in 31-EDO once the valve slides are adjusted<br/>properly), considering that corrections of this small magnitude can<br/>be easily compensated for by an adjustment in the player&apos;s<br/>embouchure.  A compensating mechanism is used for the third valve<br/>(which in my plan alters the pitch by 4:5 instead of a minor third;<br/>there are a couple of very good reasons for doing this), which brings<br/>alternate lengths of tubing into play for the other valves and keeps<br/>the maximum departure to 5.0 cents.  In 22-EDO the maximum departure<br/>goes up to 6.9 cents, whereas in 41-EDO it drops to 4.4 cents; in 19-<br/>EDO it is 5.4 cents.  (These are for the best fingerings; the lower-<br/>numbered systems have some alternate fingerings, some of which have a<br/>greater departure from the theoretically correct length for the EDO.)</p><p>Notice that I used the term &quot;departure&quot; to indicate a difference (in<br/>the equivalent number of cents) of the actual tube length from that<br/>which would be theoretically exact for a given EDO.  I believe that<br/>this term (which originated with Bosanquet) is preferable to &quot;error&quot;<br/>or &quot;deviation&quot; for this purpose (which terms are generally used to<br/>describe the difference in cents of an interval from its just or<br/>rational value).  Perhaps &quot;departure&quot; would be a good term to add to<br/>Monz&apos;s tuning dictionary.  (If so, let me know, Joe, and I will give<br/>you the reference, if you don&apos;t already have it.)</p><p>I have all of these figures on a spreadsheet, but some explanation<br/>would be required.  Perhaps it would be good to present this soon,<br/>once we have gotten the notation discussion finished.</p><p>By the way, I should add one disclaimer: 41-EDO has too many tones to<br/>permit it to follow conventional usage of the first and second<br/>valves; but everything else, from 36-EDO down, does, with the first<br/>and second valves together producing (where possible) a close<br/>approximation of a 5:6 alteration in pitch (the one notable<br/>exception: 17-EDO).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The problem with 72-EDO is that it requires another valve -- more<br/>&gt; &gt; complicated and more expensive to make, although (now that I<br/>think<br/>&gt; &gt; about it) I did come up with another idea recently that would<br/>&gt; &gt; completely change the picture.  Hmmm -- I need to give that some<br/>&gt; more<br/>&gt; &gt; thought; it&apos;s really different!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ok -- i was thinking more in terms of reed instruments, rather than<br/>&gt; brasses.</p><p>Woodwind instruments with discrete keying for 72-EDO would be a lot<br/>more complicated, involving a lot of tone holes, not to mention the<br/>problem of coming up with fingerings for all of those notes; it&apos;s not<br/>impossible, but I have the impression that, in order to maintain both<br/>a sufficient amount of logical order and fingering facility, it would<br/>have to be very different from what woodwind players are currently<br/>accustomed to.  (By the way, I have some woodwind background too.  I<br/>played the clarinet and bass clarinet in high school, and I once took<br/>a college course in which I spent 9 weeks apiece learning to play the<br/>oboe and bassoon.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What I like about 31 is that it preserves the conventional<br/>diatonic<br/>&gt; &gt; system and is least disruptive to established harmonic norms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Considering all the fuss lately about &quot;major third 1/12 down&quot; in<br/>72<br/>&gt; &gt; (will the real major third please stand up), this is easily<br/>avoided<br/>&gt; &gt; in 31.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; until you start playing augmented chords or schubert or &quot;giant<br/>steps&quot;<br/>&gt; by coltrane.</p><p>Any system has its trade-offs, its own unique combination of<br/>capabilities and limitations, and anybody who wants to get into<br/>microtonality is just going to have to face the fact that there is<br/>going to be some sort of readjustment in one&apos;s way of thinking.  I<br/>just happen to believe that 31-EDO is least disorienting, while<br/>offering some new harmonic materials that are reasonably well in<br/>tune.  If I can come up with a just (or near-just) tonal system that<br/>suits my purposes and will map consistently into 31 (which I have), I<br/>would then have the option to build instruments of fixed pitch tuned<br/>to this and use them in combination with orchestral instruments (of<br/>flexible pitch) in 31.  (If you don&apos;t care for 31, the same could be<br/>done with 41 or perhaps something else.)  This is how I envision<br/>the &quot;big picture.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In 72 you have to train to handle more than one kind of major<br/>&gt; &gt; third, which can get downright confusing, considering current<br/>&gt; musical<br/>&gt; &gt; training.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And what I like about 41<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where you&apos;d also have to train to handle more than one kind of<br/>major<br/>&gt; third -- farther from 12-tET and farther from just, respectively,<br/>&gt; than the two kinds in 72.</p><p>That&apos;s just one of those trade-offs; it all depends on what you want<br/>to do.</p><p>&gt; &gt; is that you have complete consistency in the<br/>&gt; &gt; 15 limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; glad you&apos;re enjoying the consistency concept that i came up with.<br/>&gt; looking deeper, though, one finds that each equal temperament has<br/>its<br/>&gt; own set of &quot;identities&quot; or &quot;equivalencies&quot; or &quot;unison vectors&quot;<br/>which<br/>&gt; will determine compositional behavior to a large extent -- for<br/>&gt; example in determining MOS or omnitetrachordal scales where<br/>&gt; Krumhansl&apos;s psychological conditions for the encoding of tonal<br/>&gt; information may be satisfied. 41 has some very specific things that<br/>&gt; it can and can&apos;t do, and one can look at 46, for example, a 13-<br/>limit<br/>&gt; consistent equal temperament, and see a whole host of possibilities<br/>&gt; that 41 misses.</p><p>I have always believed in a multi-system approach, so I think you&apos;ve<br/>made a couple of points here for a position which I already hold, one<br/>which leaves the door open to pursue one&apos;s preference(s).  I just<br/>want to make sure that we don&apos;t give those who wish to pursue some of<br/>these other systems the impression that we are excluding them in our<br/>rush to embrace 72-EDO as some sort of &quot;standard.&quot;</p><p>And what about some of those other systems?</p><p>But for a small fraction of a cent 46-EDO misses 17-limit consistency<br/>for a single pair of intervals (15/13 &amp; 26/15)!  I don&apos;t think this<br/>precludes using it for 17-limit harmony (no EDO of lower number can<br/>compete with it), and I know from experience that 15-limit harmonies<br/>can be successfully employed in 31-EDO without any disorientation<br/>whatsoever (with 13 being implied, much more successfully, in my<br/>opinion, than 7 is in 12-EDO), even if you have a couple of pairs of<br/>intervals that go over the boundary of consistency by a couple of<br/>cents or so.  (The same can be said for 19/13 and 26/19 in 72-EDO.)<br/>I would compare this to briefly driving a car very slightly onto the<br/>shoulder, but not far enough off the road to lose control.  (However,<br/>if you are really a nut for consistency, try 311-EDO -- to the 41<br/>limit!)</p><p>I have been familiar with the concept of consistency for almost as<br/>long as I have been exploring microtonality (which has spanned some<br/>38 years), and I even used the term &quot;inconsistent&quot; in my own notes to<br/>indicate the lack thereof in certain tonal systems, most notably 24-<br/>EDO, so it is quite natural for me to refer to it, not only for the<br/>way in which just intervals are represented in various EDO&apos;s, but<br/>also for the suitability of mapping just intervals onto various<br/>divisions of the octave (VDO&apos;s? or various DO&apos;s?), for which latter<br/>case 31-DO is suitable for some rational-interval or near-just<br/>tunings at least up to the 25 limit.</p><p>This said, I am also aware that you have formally developed the<br/>concept of consistency quite a bit beyond the simple way in which I<br/>have employed it, for which accomplishment you richly deserve credit<br/>and recognition.</p><p>&gt; also, joseph&apos;s question about favoring equal temperaments uber<br/>alles<br/>&gt; merits a little more attention. 29-equal is also consistent, but<br/>not<br/>&gt; very accurate, through the 15-limit. but graham breed recently<br/>&gt; reminded us that *two* 29-equal chains, a few cents apart, gives<br/>you<br/>&gt; outstanding accuracy in the 15-limit, not to mention a great wealth<br/>&gt; of modulational and transpositional freedom. given the desiderata<br/>of<br/>&gt; fewer than sixty notes per octave, great 15-limit accuracy, and<br/>great<br/>&gt; transpositional freedom, it would be hard to do better than this<br/>&gt; *non*-equal-temperament.</p><p>I have prized the 29-DO for the opportunity it provided me in mapping<br/>a certain 15-limit near-just system that is one of my favorite<br/>tunings.

Does your example really have much to do<br/>with the consistency concept? The whole concept as I understand it involves<br/>the compounding of errors, which is really only at issue with sequences of<br/>intervals analyzed (heard) simultaneously. Errors accrue more quickly in<br/>systems which are less consistent.  If we want an ET system that suppies one<br/>acceptable 256:243 approximation, we can take our pick, but if we want an ET<br/>system which allows us to map consecutive intervals without landing on the<br/>&quot;wrong&quot; scale step, then we choose one with a high level of consistency.  We<br/>can always choose the &quot;wrong&quot; step to map the compounded interval.  The point<br/>is that if we break it up into its constituent parts as a sequence of<br/>intervals, it doesn&apos;t work.  So it all depends how we want to write music.<br/>Errors can be hidden all over the place.  If we want the most freedom in<br/>terms of harmonic combinatoriality of intervals, we should choose a managable<br/>ET with a high degree of consistency.  Don&apos;t you agree?</p><p>thanks,<br/>Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=33727 href="#33727">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2002 11:04:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Pitchcolor@a... wrote:</p><p>Errors accrue more quickly in<br/>&gt; systems which are less consistent.</p><p>Errors compound to larger errors if they are larger to start with, and to relatively larger errors if they are relatively larger to start with.</p><p> If we want an ET system that suppies one<br/>&gt; acceptable 256:243 approximation, we can take our pick, but if we want an ET<br/>&gt; system which allows us to map consecutive intervals without landing on the<br/>&gt; &quot;wrong&quot; scale step, then we choose one with a high level of consistency.</p><p>You need to define what you mean by &quot;wrong&quot; in this particular instance, and then see if the system in question is or is not doing what you want it to do.

Or<br/>even if<br/>&gt; you could add an extra valve or hole to move the 15.6 cents from<br/>the<br/>&gt; default tuning.  29-equal is close to Pythagorean, so this might be<br/>&gt; practical on a brass instrument.</p><p>If we&apos;re talking about instruments of flexible pitch, I think we&apos;re<br/>better off just using instruments in 41-EDO.

Make them unequal and you lose half the chords, but gain in<br/>&gt; accuracy.</p><p>I don&apos;t do guitar, so no comment.</p><p>&gt; But generally, how easy is it to add an arbitrary &quot;comma shift&quot; key<br/>to a<br/>&gt; woodwind instrument?  I was also wondering if you could build a<br/>woodwind<br/>&gt; around an unequal decimal scale, and add some kind of switch for<br/>getting<br/>&gt; the quommas for Blackjack-1.  Would it have to be a particular<br/>shift of<br/>&gt; frequency or wavelength rather than pitch?  It may even be that you<br/>could<br/>&gt; pitch-bend for the quommas with a consistent timbre.</p><p>Again, as Paul Erlich predicted, I would say for Blackjack and<br/>Canasta, 41-EDO instruments are my quick reply to this one (in answer<br/>to your question, Joseph).  It&apos;s possible that a 72-EDO subset that<br/>took in all the required pitches could be worked out with my<br/>convertible-brass-instrument design (conversion being done by<br/>adjusting valve slides, where possible, or otherwise swapping out<br/>crooks of tubing -- in answer to your question, Paul).  But a<br/>microtonal approach to woodwinds is something that I have only<br/>recently begun to think about, so I haven&apos;t yet given this enough<br/>thought to come to any conclusions about whether certain things might<br/>or might not be practical for these instruments.  Thinking these<br/>things through takes time, and sometimes I have to leave them off for<br/>a while and work on something else, and then come back and take a<br/>fresh look at whatever problem I was trying to solve.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=33733 href="#33733">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2002 1:47:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Pitchcolor@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt;paul hahn consistency levels (or<br/>&gt; any associated &apos;level&apos;-based accuracy measure) for 22-equal in the<br/>3-<br/>&gt; , 5-, and 7-limits are 3, 2, and 1. in all cases the implication is<br/>&gt; that 22-equal is somehow limited in its ability to evoke the<br/>256:243<br/>&gt; function.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Paul, I was introduced to the ideas about consistency,<br/>completeness and<br/>&gt; diameter through Patrick&apos;s work.</p><p>excellent.</p><p>&gt; Does your example really have much to do<br/>&gt; with the consistency concept?</p><p>with paul hahn&apos;s consistency levels, yes.</p><p>&gt; The whole concept as I understand it involves<br/>&gt; the compounding of errors, which is really only at issue with<br/>sequences of<br/>&gt; intervals analyzed (heard) simultaneously.</p><p>do you really mean sequences (as in music), or do you really mean<br/>simultaneously?</p><p>&gt; Errors accrue more quickly in<br/>&gt; systems which are less consistent.

Sure, the enharmonicity is missing,<br/>and the instrument might not do so well in playing Beethoven or<br/>Chopin, but the point is, nobody is going to *use* that instrument<br/>for &quot;authentic&quot; performances of Beethoven or Chopin.</p><p>Beethoven and Chopin will be &quot;early music...&quot; and these pieces will<br/>be performed on &quot;period&quot; instruments, i.e. *ACOUSTIC* pianos, and<br/>hopefully, as Ed Foote does and others, in the *correct* tunings of<br/>the day as well...</p><p>So what does this mean for our discussion?</p><p>Well, it means that the addition of an *electronic* component to<br/>instruments, such as woodwinds, is not such a &quot;big deal.&quot;  Quite<br/>possibly we will &quot;get used&quot; to the electronically-modified sounds and<br/>the &quot;real&quot; sounds of acoustic instruments will sound and<br/>seem &quot;antiquated&quot; or &quot;period&quot; pieces.</p><p>If that be the case, which is the *premise* of this post (please save<br/>the eggs and tomatoes until *after* the post has concluded) then it<br/>means that having some kind of &quot;translation&quot; of the *performed* pitch<br/>of a woodwind, let&apos;s say, is &quot;no big deal&quot;...</p><p>The performer will just play *normally* and with a *foot pedal* or<br/>some such, could play the *alterations* for 72-tET, for instance...<br/>with only *three* necessary, of course, the 1/12 of a whole tone, the<br/>1/6th of a whole tone and the quarter tone.</p><p>That would all be done by *alteration* of the existing tone by some<br/>kind of adaptive mechanism, more akin to the present &quot;MIDI<br/>controllers&quot; for woodwinds today.  Of course, those are not really<br/>*excellent* instruments yet.  *That* development will have to take<br/>place... but I mean a *fine* instrument that has the capability to<br/>electronically alter the sound as post-processing.</p><p>It seems this is a *much* more logical and inevitable development<br/>than the so-called &quot;logical&quot; instruments which demand electronic<br/>alteration of the *acoustic* mechanical mechanisms of traditional<br/>instruments.  Not only is it *much* more difficult to make such<br/>instruments but the point is, *nobody will appreciate them* since<br/>the &quot;contemporary&quot; sound that people will expect will be an<br/>*electronic* one.</p><p>Ok.. now is the time for the tomatoes...  :)</p><p>And, by the way, if anyone wants to place a *bet* about all this, I<br/>know I will collect, and will expect to in 100 years!   :)</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=33750 href="#33750">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2002 8:48:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jpehrson2&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; that<br/>&gt; is that the top line seems to descend chromatically through the<br/>&gt; entire 22-tET scale.

&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; have the electromechanical mechanism translate this into the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; appropriate coverings of the tone holes for 72-equal??<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And if most or all of one&apos;s available fingers are already busy<br/>&gt; &gt; performing the standard 12-equal fingerings, then where are you<br/>going<br/>&gt; &gt; to come up with fingers to operate these keys?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; when i played clarinet i don&apos;t think i ever used all my fingers.<br/>but giving you the benefit of the doubt, how about a simple footpedal?</p><p>So you never played B on the third line of the staff or low E?</p><p>Anyway, it sounds as if you&apos;ll need several pedals to do this.  Do<br/>you think clarinet players will be willing to dance in order to play<br/>microtones?  (Sorry.  I couldn&apos;t resist the joke.)</p><p>All kidding aside now, I thought about this a little bit, and maybe<br/>this one isn&apos;t as difficult as it sounds.  Using the logical woodwind<br/>technology, I would start by retaining the existing diatonic<br/>fingering patterns on the instrument and using the 4th (little)<br/>fingers of both hands to operate several different keys, separately<br/>or in combination, to effect uniform pitch alterations to the<br/>diatonic tones.</p><p>On the clarinet the player already uses the 4th fingers to operate 7<br/>different keys (3 for the left hand and 4 for the right hand), so the<br/>technique of moving these fingers to operate multiple keys is a<br/>familiar one.  Suppose that we use these keys for the microtonal<br/>adjustments to pitch.  Assuming that we wouldn&apos;t require any finger<br/>to press more than one key at a time, we would have 19 possible<br/>alterations (combinations of one or two 4th-finger keys at a time) of<br/>those diatonic tones available to us.  Hmmm, you know, this is more<br/>than enough for 72-EDO, considering that it only takes 11 different<br/>alterations to fill in all of the 1/12ths of a tone over the range of<br/>a whole tone.  Those remaining combinations could be used for<br/>alternate fingerings, so this just might work!</p><p>There&apos;s still the matter of finding another way to get the tones at<br/>both ends of the register, since the 4th fingers are now doing<br/>microtones, but, just as you put fingers down in order to go down the<br/>scale, once you reach the bottom you could them lift them up in order<br/>from the top end to continue downward (for both clarinet *and*<br/>bassoon) until you have only the 3rd finger of the right hand down.</p><p>For the bassoon, this idea would also eliminate the need for the<br/>player to be an acrobat with the thumbs in the lowest half-octave of<br/>the range, since the new fingerings would now get you all the way<br/>down to the low B-flat without using any of those extra thumb keys.<br/>(And if you wanted, you could use those thumbs for some of the<br/>microtones instead of or in addition to the 4th fingers.)</p><p>For the clarinet, I would make the thumb and three fingers down be a<br/>C, but instead of sounding B-flat, it would sound C -- same fingering<br/>for the written note, but sounding as written.  So now we no longer<br/>have the burden of a tranposing instrument! (Isn&apos;t that nifty?  Who<br/>wanted to contend with a microtonal transposing instrument anyway?)<br/>And here&apos;s something else that puts the frosting on the cake: the<br/>extra low-range fingerings would enable you to have an instrument<br/>with an extended low range (down to concert B-flat, a major third<br/>lower than at present; no, even lower: that was without counting what<br/>the microtone keys would do!).</p><p>Design microtonal woodwinds on one&apos;s lunch hour?

I do not think a<br/>flute is<br/>&gt; intended to play in a tuning so much as it can play most any tuning<br/>required.</p><p>Within limits.  Without a player, the flute can&apos;t play a thing, and<br/>then it is limited by two things, the ability of the player, and the<br/>5-limit, for which it was designed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Similarly, the bassoon is not intended to play in equal temperament<br/>as much<br/>&gt; as it is intended to play in tune.</p><p>Again, in the 5 limit.</p><p>&gt;   If microtonality is going to be so difficult to achieve that<br/>&gt; &gt; it is going to be beyond the reach of all but an elite group,<br/>then<br/>&gt; &gt; there is no chance of its becoming a part of the musical<br/>mainstream,<br/>&gt; &gt; achievable by unexceptional amateur musicians, and it will be<br/>doomed<br/>&gt; &gt; to remain a very small niche in the world of music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; This is not really true.  Foremost, great recordings and<br/>performances will do<br/>&gt; more than amateur futzing.  More importantly, playing a microtonal<br/>fingering<br/>&gt; is no more difficult than playing a conventional fingering.  Now,<br/>if<br/>&gt; conventional fingerings are too difficult, then we are not talking<br/>about<br/>&gt; professional musicians of any caliber.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My list of virtuosi are to signal that the terrain has already been<br/>mapped<br/>&gt; out.  Now, less gifted players can simply following the necessary<br/>fingering.<br/>&gt; Now, if you want to do away with be able to hear a pitch in the<br/>head all<br/>&gt; together, I&apos;m not sure what you are really driving at, other than a<br/>&gt; microtonal sort of Nintendo.  Frankly, having the exact fingerings<br/>for a<br/>&gt; tuning should be gravy for a composer/player.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And fingerings are FREE!  No added expenses beyond a traditional<br/>&gt; instrument...other than training.</p><p>You&apos;d better underline &quot;training&quot; at least a couple of times.  I can<br/>guarantee you that there&apos;s more involved in a lot of this than just<br/>learning some new fingerings, and for some of these instruments I<br/>would not even recommend that anyone try these techniques unless they<br/>are already highly proficient players.

It seems however, regrettably, that the &quot;appetite&quot; for<br/>acoustic instruments is actually on the wane, and for &quot;traditional&quot;<br/>art music, although that&apos;s just being redefined these days.<br/>Additionally, music education isn&apos;t what it used to be in the<br/>schools, as you know, so many people don&apos;t even have *band* anymore.<br/>Maybe this will change, or develop into something different, most<br/>probably.  Maybe computer classes where suddenly everybody jumps up<br/>with earphones and starts &quot;jammin&apos;&quot; at the computer keyboard...  :)</p><p>Anyway, I can see the idea of using a foot pedal that is more<br/>a &quot;lever&quot; type, looking more like a classical guitar footstand than<br/>anything, but which cantilevers forward and back.  Perhaps there are<br/>*three* &quot;notches&quot; forward which are perceptible clicks and three<br/>backwards.  Those would correspond, of course, to your 12th of a<br/>whole tone 6th of a whole tone and quarter tone going in each<br/>direction.  The player would have to get used to changing these with<br/>the *one* foot pedal quickly, but it seems that would be much easier<br/>than learning or designing an entirely new instrument!</p><p>This would mean, though, that somehow (don&apos;t ask *me* this is still<br/>hypothetical!  :) ) the sound from the bell would go into some<br/>electronic processing unit that would make the microtonal<br/>inflections, and would still come out sounding like a fine clarinet<br/>sound, or at least a reasonable simulation thereof.</p><p>Just an idea... but to me it would seem like more profitable research<br/>than totally redesigning instruments.

All we can really<br/>accomplish is to use as many as possible with the less amount of inventory.<br/>    Also it appears to my ear just as different singers develop their own &quot;intonation&apos; i sense<br/>different composers imply different intonations.<br/>    To finally end, it seems that given random intervals performers will gravitate to the closest<br/>acoustical phenomenon possible.</p><p>jpehrson2 wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_33601.html#33829">/tuning/topicId_33601.html#33829</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In reading the digests of the postings of the past 24 hours or so,<br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; recall seeing a conversation in which a question was raised whether<br/>&gt; &gt; players (or singers) might tend toward just intonation if they were<br/>&gt; &gt; performing along with instruments of fixed pitch tuned to rational<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals.

Yes, the bassoon was *designed* for 12-EDO<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; also *intended* for 5-limit harmony.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; well, you have to be a bit more specific. do you mean *adaptive* 5-<br/>&gt; limit harmony, where the melodic intervals are not necessarily<br/>simple<br/>&gt; ratios? it&apos;s important to say so, since a lot of people see &apos;5-<br/>limit&apos;<br/>&gt; and think &apos;strict 5-limit JI&apos;. even then, it would only be &apos;maybe&apos;,<br/>&gt; because since 1800 or so, musicians have been taught to play sharps<br/>&gt; *at least as high* as the enharmonically equivalent flats. this,<br/>&gt; unfortunately, does not facilitate adaptive 5-limit harmony.</p><p>Any player of an instrument of fixed pitch that is attempting to<br/>play &quot;in tune&quot; (whatever that means) is by nature employing<br/>*adaptive* intonation (of whatever sort).

And when<br/>&gt; &gt; departures from 12-ET do occur, I think that they are more likely<br/>&gt; &gt; than not to be in the direction of Pythagorean tuning (for<br/>melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; purposes) rather than just intonation, with the strings in<br/>&gt; &gt;particular.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; well then, where does that leave the &apos;5-limit&apos; for flutes and<br/>&gt; bassoons? neither in design nor in practice . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sorry to be so picky, just trying to foster clarity for the sake of<br/>&gt; those struggling to follow along . . .</p><p>I believe that, in an ideal performance, the players should have the<br/>sensitivity to alter their intonation in both ways -- toward the<br/>Pythagorean in a resolving chord, and toward (5-limit) just<br/>intonation in the resolution.

Contrary to what my teachers believed, the seventh<br/>&gt; partial is not<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;unusable.&quot; Combine a &quot;high third&quot; with a super-flat seventh over a<br/>&gt; dominant<br/>&gt;&gt; root and you&apos;ve got tension that *cries* for resolution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tension is definitely the word, although, as a couple others also<br/>&gt; noted, some of us might judge the interval between the third and<br/>&gt; seventh of the chord to be so small as to be interpeted as something<br/>&gt; other than a diminished fifth (which is why I used the term &quot;5-limit&quot;<br/>&gt; above).</p><p>Wow!
