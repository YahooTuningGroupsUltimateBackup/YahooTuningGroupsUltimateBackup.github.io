If we look at 4-5-6 we notice that the<br/>&gt; difference tones are one. Now if we continue to feed a recurrent<br/>&gt; sequence with the formula of meta-meantone (expressed in simplest terms<br/>&gt; (A+B)x2=E we converge upon a certain number. This formula says that A<br/>&gt; which we could call the root plus B otherwise known as the &quot;fifth&quot; is<br/>&gt; equal to E the third. Why E? Because in the chain, E is four fifths<br/>&gt; above. Now it is possible to seed this formula how one wishes. In Erv&apos;s<br/>&gt; example on page 4 he starts 1   2.5   3   5   7   11  but it might be<br/>&gt; clearer if we start with 16 24 36 54 80 as A, B, C, D, E. we see that<br/>&gt; (16+ 24)x2=80 so next we treat 24 as A and then 36 as B which generates<br/>&gt; 120 and so on. Going back to Page 1 we see the series carried out beyond<br/>&gt; that on page 4 . Already with the last few numbers we can see that it<br/>&gt; closing in on converging on the stated ratio. Which comes out BTW to be<br/>&gt; 695.6304373 cents and the triads will be proportional and equal beating.</p><p>At first I thought I knew this series, as years ago I found one starting strictly by the same 7<br/>frequencies.<br/>But mine was only very close (1.493 358 556 560 19 or 694,27 c,<br/>instead of Erv Wilson&apos;s           1.494 530 180 48 ...    or 695.63 c)<br/>the fifth in my algorithm fulfills the equation  4x - x^4 = 1   while his does  x^4 - 2x = 2<br/>taking your example we can express it   4B - E = A   and the series (simplified by 2) goes<br/>8  12  18  27  40  60  90  133  200  300  442  667  1000  1468  2226  3333... instead of<br/>8  12  18  27  40  60  90  134  200  300  448  668  1000  1496  2232  3336...<br/>my musical interest here was to have the difference tones generated by the minor thirds (4B - E)<br/>to belong to the scale, being equal to A. The first difference comes only with the eigth term, 133<br/>(instead of 134 in the other serie) and indeed 160 - 133 = 27 makes the minor third coherent,<br/>while in Erv&apos;s it&apos;s the major sixths which have their first-order difference tone in the scale,<br/>ex. 134 - 80 = 54 and so on.<br/>It is rare to find fractal series that close, and this co&iuml;&iquest;&half;ncidence should help to find specially<br/>interesting sounds for the meta-meantone.</p><p>If you like that type of series which provide, I think, fantastic alernatives to current<br/>temperaments,<br/>this is another one : take the five first terms of the above metas, 8  12  18  27  40 and turn them</p><p>upside down, which create a cycle of fourths, 20  27  36  48  64 - and note there is a another<br/>type of minor third here, 64 - 54 (octave of 27) = 10, which is the octave below 20. If we repeat<br/>that sequence recurrently, we generate a series where all minor thirds have also their difference<br/>tone<br/>in tune with the fifth interval, resumed in the algorithm 2x^4 - 4x = 1 (or 2E - 4B = A)<br/>Now the ratios between consecutive frequencies are converging towards  1.334 157 447 130 13...<br/>or 499.11 c, which is not far from 4/3. Because of  a need for even numbers for A, the series need<br/>constant octave-refreshing, such as  80  108  144  192  256  342  456  608  812  1083 1444 1928<br/>...and so on (quite lovely for medieval music)</p></div>
