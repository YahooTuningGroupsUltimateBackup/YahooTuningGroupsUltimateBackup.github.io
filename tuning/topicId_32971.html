Here at last is Part One of my saggital notation<br/>presentation, and I hope you agree that it was worth waiting for.</p><p>In this first part of the presentation I will illustrate the process<br/>by which I arrived at the 72-EDO form of the notation.  Subsequent<br/>installments will address its multi-system application, both in<br/>native (or EDO-specific) and transcendental (or trans-system generic)<br/>forms, leaving most of the questions and comments that have been made<br/>regarding the more controversial aspect of the subject for the final<br/>installment.</p><p>It is perhaps a bit of a stretch to call this buried treasure,<br/>inasmuch as this is so new that there has barely been enough time to<br/>get any &quot;dust&quot; on the paperwork (most of which is virtual, in the<br/>form of computer files; hmmm, I do seem to notice some dust on the<br/>monitor screen).  I reasoned that the presentation would be more<br/>widely read, especially by future members of the Tuning List, if I<br/>put it in my Buried Treasure column.</p><p>At the beginning of the year I made a new year&apos;s resolution to<br/>complete the development and testing of my notation, and I am sharing<br/>it with you to elicit your comments and suggestions to make this the<br/>very best notation possible, one that will come closest to &quot;doing it<br/>all&quot; and doing it well.</p><p>So as not to keep you in further suspension, let the resolution begin!</p><p>*A Challenge I Couldn&apos;t Resist!*</p><p>Please note:  The figures for this presentation are in:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/figures.bmp">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/figures.bmp</a></p><p>I have always believed that the best notation is that which is<br/>simplest.  A good example of this is the Tartini fractional sharps<br/>(shown in the right half of the top row of Figure 1), which are so<br/>clear that they require virtually no explanation.  Although these<br/>were employed by both Ivan Vyshnegradsky (for 24-EDO) and Adriaan<br/>Fokker (for 31-EDO), it is rather surprising that quartertone<br/>composers never adopted these as a standard notation.  Instead, they<br/>often preferred to place arrows in front of notes, which, in<br/>combination with sharps or flats, tend to clutter a musical<br/>manuscript, especially when chords are notated on a single staff.</p><p>Existing methods of notating 72-EDO have also used this approach, and<br/>the diversity of symbols used somewhat arbitrarily (and not always<br/>logically) to designate three different amounts of alteration in<br/>pitch strikes me as a conglomeration of add-ons or do-dads intended<br/>to supplement traditional notational practice.  However, I did not<br/>see these 72-EDO notations (including the one devised by Ezra Sims)<br/>until several months after I had produced the initial (expanded)<br/>version of my saggital notation, so they had absolutely no influence<br/>in its development.  To be completely honest, once I did see them, I<br/>was appalled.  I later learned that the symbols that were proposed by<br/>those on the Alternate Tuning List were ASCII versions for<br/>theoretical use only, not practical notation intended for use on an<br/>actual musical manuscript, and the goal was largely to emulate the<br/>Sims notation.  Inasmuch as my goal was to arrive at the very best<br/>notation possible, it is understandable that, immediately upon seeing<br/>it, I found that I had absolutely no desire to emulate the Sims<br/>notation, and it should be evident by the end of this part of the<br/>presentation that any similarity between the Sims and the saggital<br/>symbols is purely coincidental.</p><p>It is not an easy matter to arrive at a simple notation that would<br/>require only a single symbol to modify the pitch of the seven<br/>naturals notes on the staff for 72-EDO.  In the first place, 24<br/>symbols would be needed for a complete range of alteration by a whole<br/>tone, both upward and downward.  In order for this approach to be<br/>successful, the new symbols would need to have an intuitiveness that<br/>would enable them to be quickly and easily understood.  They would<br/>also need to be similar enough that they could be easily remembered,<br/>yet different enough that there would be no difficulty in<br/>distinguishing them from one another.  This was a challenge that I<br/>couldn&apos;t resist!</p><p>The solution did not come quickly, however, as it soon became evident<br/>that this is one situation where the desired result would not be<br/>achieved without investing a considerable amount of time and effort.<br/>I spent hours putting all sorts of symbols, both old and new, on a<br/>piece of paper, seeking as many ideas as possible from which to<br/>choose.  In the end I found that the best ideas were ones that had<br/>already been successfully used in the past, and my saggital notation<br/>integrates three of these into a unified set of symbols.  These three<br/>ideas are: 1) the use of arrows to indicate alterations in pitch up<br/>and down, 2) the intuitiveness of the Tartini fractional sharps, and<br/>3) the slanted lines used by Bosanquet to indicate commatic<br/>alterations.</p><p>*Tartini Plus Arrows*</p><p>Up and down arrows can be employed to indicate clearly the direction<br/>in which the pitch is to be altered, and it was immediately obvious<br/>that it would be necessary to have only 12 different symbols if each<br/>symbol of the new notation could be inverted or mirrored vertically<br/>to symbolize equal-but-opposite amounts of alteration.  This would<br/>require discarding the traditional single and double sharp symbols<br/>(as well as excluding the Tartini fractional sharps from<br/>consideration), inasmuch as they look virtually the same when<br/>inverted.  A traditional flat symbol can be inverted and does<br/>resemble a hand with a finger pointing; the problem is that it points<br/>in the wrong direction, so I concluded that it would also need to be<br/>discarded.  Of the conventional symbols, only the &quot;natural&quot; symbol<br/>would be retained.</p><p>In my first version of the sagittal notation of August 2001 (which I<br/>now call the expanded saggital symbols), I used arrows as semisharp<br/>and semiflat symbols, with multiple arrowheads for single, sesqui,<br/>and double sharps and flats.  These are shown in the second row of<br/>Figure 1.  The use of arrows to represent semisharps and semiflats<br/>may seem somewhat arbitrary, inasmuch as they have been used in<br/>different instances to represent various amounts of pitch alteration,<br/>but I felt that their frequent use for notating quartertones was<br/>adequate justification.</p><p>In December I realized that these symbols could be simplified by<br/>replacing the multiple arrowheads with single arrows that are<br/>combined with one to three vertical strokes, as in the Tartini<br/>fractional sharps, with an &quot;X&quot; for the double sharp and flat, as<br/>shown in the third row of Figure 1.  The single arrowheads not only<br/>make the symbols more compact, but they also permit a bolder print<br/>(or font) style to be employed, which improves legibility.</p><p>If the abandonment of the conventional sharp and flat symbols seems a<br/>bit shocking, we need to realize that, although they have served us<br/>well since they were devised in the Middle Ages, 21st-century<br/>microtonality will be better served by something new and better, and<br/>I think that it is safe to say it is about time for an upgrade.  We<br/>can continue to call these sharps and flats with semi, sesqui, and<br/>double prefixes added as appropriate, inasmuch as it is only the<br/>symbols that are changing, not their names or meanings.</p><p>This set of 9 symbols is sufficient to notate 17, 24, and 31-EDO.<br/>However, more symbols would be needed for 72-EDO.</p><p>*Plus Bosanquet*</p><p>The third idea to find its way into my saggital notation was the<br/>symbol for commatic alterations in 53-EDO that Bosanquet used around<br/>1875.  These are shown in the top row of Figure 2, which illustrates<br/>a lateral grouping for multi-comma alterations.  The single degree of<br/>72-EDO is similar in size to that of 53-EDO, with the intervals<br/>representing just (5:4) and Pythagorean (81:64) major thirds<br/>differing in size by this amount in each system, so the use of this<br/>sort of symbol would not be inappropriate to indicate an alteration<br/>of a single degree in 72-EDO.  I first added a stem to the Bosanquet<br/>symbol to form a sort of half-arrow or flag.  I then stacked several<br/>of these flags to indicate multiple-degree alterations, as in the<br/>second row of Figure 2.</p><p>I quickly realized that the symbol that I was already using to alter<br/>by 3 degrees differed from the 1-degree symbol by only a right half-<br/>arrow or flag, and that it would be quite logical to represent a 2-<br/>degree alteration with a backward 1-degree symbol.  The resulting<br/>expanded saggital symbols are shown in the third row of Figure 2.<br/>These were subsequently simplified into the compact saggital notation<br/>shown in the fourth row of Figure 2.  Observe that each new half-<br/>arrow (or Bosanquet flag) symbol is adjacent to a full-arrow symbol,<br/>with the slant of the Bosanquet flag corresponding to the direction<br/>in which the pitch symbolized by the adjacent (full-arrow) symbol<br/>must be altered to arrive at the pitch symbolized by the Bosanquet<br/>flag symbol: upward slope signifies alteration one degree (or comma)<br/>up, while downward slope signifies one degree (or comma) down.</p><p>The full range of symbols is shown in Figure 3, along with some<br/>examples on a musical staff comparing other notations with the new<br/>saggital notation.</p><p>Both the compact and expanded versions of the saggital symbols may be<br/>simulated with ASCII characters for e-mail messages, etc., using a<br/>combination of the slash, backslash, pipe, and capital X characters.<br/>One comma down is \|, semisharp is /|\, and doubleflat is \X/<br/>(compact) or \\\\|//// (expanded).  While this generally involves<br/>more characters than with other proposed ASCII notation, it is more<br/>intuitive, and it inconveniences the theorist rather than the<br/>musician.  (Please note that the combination of ASCII symbols has a<br/>better appearance when a proportionally spaced font is used; my<br/>choice is Ariel.)</p><p>The next part of this presentation will discuss how the notation may<br/>be applied logically and consistently to other EDO&apos;s, beginning with<br/>31 and 41, as well as the use of the 72-EDO symbols as a<br/>transcendental notation for sets of just (or near-just) tones mapped<br/>onto a lesser division of the octave.</p><p>Until next time, please stay tuned!</p><p>--George</p><p>Love / joy / peace / patience ...</p></div><h3><a id=32975 href="#32975">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2002 2:13:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_32971.html#32971">/tuning/topicId_32971.html#32971</a></p><p>&gt; *BURIED TREASURE*<br/>&gt; &quot;Notation - Part 1&quot;<br/>&gt; From: George Secor<br/>&gt; January 22, 2002<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Patience comes to those who wait for it, and I thank you all for<br/>your patience.</p><p>*****I suppose it would be better for me to wait until George Secor<br/>has made his *entire* presentation before I start talking.</p><p>However, I&apos;m excited and interested in the commentary, so I may start<br/>anyway...</p><p>The problem, basically, is that I have been rejected from the jury.<br/>I&apos;m a *very* biased participant, having pretty much decided to stick<br/>with the Maneri/Sims 72-tET notation.  For one thing, I am already<br/>writing in it, am used to it, and if composers of the stature of Sims<br/>and Maneri have been using it and training musicians to use it, it<br/>becomes a kind of &quot;standard&quot; that I don&apos;t want to subvert, even if I<br/>have minor disagreements with this and that.</p><p>So, I would urge George to pay very little attention to what I say<br/>about his invention, since I&apos;m incredibly, biased, prejudiced, pre-<br/>decided, pre-determined (and probably could be called by various<br/>epithets if this were talk radio...)</p><p>However, believe it or not, I will proceed...</p><p>&gt; I have always believed that the best notation is that which is<br/>&gt; simplest.

The SCORE notation program uses the Tartini symbols (a<br/>little differently than used in 31-tET of course) for quartertones.<br/>Some people, including several contemporary notation books I have<br/>seen, *do* consider it a &quot;de facto&quot; standard, at least for quarter-<br/>tones...</p><p>&gt; Existing methods of notating 72-EDO have also used this approach,<br/>and<br/>&gt; the diversity of symbols used somewhat arbitrarily (and not always<br/>&gt; logically) to designate three different amounts of alteration in<br/>&gt; pitch strikes me as a conglomeration of add-ons or do-dads intended<br/>&gt; to supplement traditional notational practice.

It couldn&apos;t be any simpler.  The<br/>arrows and half-arrows go up and down.  The quarter-tone Sims<br/>symbols, I agree, are a bit controversial, but if one were to use the<br/>Tartini &quot;one-slash&quot; sharp and &quot;backwards flat&quot; for quarter-tones this<br/>system would *really* be optimal.  However, as I&apos;ve mentioned before,<br/>that fact that Sims and Maneri *already* have a practicing system<br/>means something to me, so I would rather forgo optimization to &quot;get<br/>with the program&quot; so to speak... :)</p><p>I later learned that the symbols that were proposed by<br/>&gt; those on the Alternate Tuning List were ASCII versions for<br/>&gt; theoretical use only, not practical notation intended for use on an<br/>&gt; actual musical manuscript, and the goal was largely to emulate the<br/>&gt; Sims notation.</p><p>**** I believe this is partially incorrect.

If we<br/>have one notation for 72, another for 31, something else for 41,<br/>something else for 22, etc., etc., imagine the learning curve (and<br/>potential confusion) this poses for someone attracted to<br/>microtonality, but who hasn&apos;t decided where to start.  If you have a<br/>well-thought-out superset of symbols (yes, I will be introducing 8<br/>more, and that&apos;s all) that can be used for just about anything (I<br/>hesitate to use the term &quot;universal&quot;), and if each and every symbol<br/>has a meaning that doesn&apos;t change when it&apos;s used for different tonal<br/>systems, then it will be much easier to read music written for any<br/>other system, once you have learned it for one.</p><p>To use an analogy, someone who speaks and reads English can<br/>readily &quot;read&quot; Spanish, French, or Latin; the problem, of course, is<br/>that they won&apos;t understand it, but, upon learning to speak a second<br/>language that uses the same alphabet, reading it is not much of a<br/>problem.  This would not be the case with a language that uses<br/>totally different symbols, such as Hebrew, Arabic, or Chinese.</p><p>Something that I need to emphasize is that this is a *practical*<br/>notation to be used on the staff and not just for theoretical<br/>discourses.  And I think you can readily appreciate the prospect that<br/>such a notation would include many who would be excluded by the<br/>considerably narrower scope of the Sims notation.</p><p>Am I making any sense?</p><p>&lt;&lt;  Let&apos;s eliminate the &quot;slashers&quot; from music....  :)</p><p>&gt; Both the compact and expanded versions of the saggital symbols may<br/>be<br/>&gt; simulated with ASCII characters for e-mail messages, etc., using a<br/>&gt; combination of the slash, backslash, pipe, and capital X<br/>characters.<br/>&gt; One comma down is \|, semisharp is /|\, and doubleflat is \X/<br/>&gt; (compact) or \\\\|//// (expanded).  While this generally involves<br/>&gt; more characters than with other proposed ASCII notation, it is more<br/>&gt; intuitive, and it inconveniences the theorist rather than the<br/>&gt; musician.  (Please note that the combination of ASCII symbols has a<br/>&gt; better appearance when a proportionally spaced font is used; my<br/>&gt; choice is Ariel.)</p><p>****This is *HORRIBLE* ASCII, George!  How could you say that??<br/>Compared to the simple symbols we&apos;ve evolved for the Sims/Maneri on<br/>this very list?  Come on!  &gt;&gt;</p><p>These are just a suggestion for ASCII.  The essence of my proposal is<br/>a *practical* staff notation, and whatever you might use for an ASCII<br/>simulation is completely up to you.  The ideal solution is to use a<br/>custom character set, but in certain instances, such as e-mail, this<br/>isn&apos;t possible, so we have to do the best we can with ASCII<br/>characters.</p><p>If I might make a comment on the Sims notation, it looks like he<br/>found them in a set of previously existing special characters for a<br/>computer, which is akin to doing it backwards.  The computer has<br/>become a valuable tool for a great number of us, but it has to keep<br/>its place as a servant, not a master that dictates to us those<br/>symbols from which we may or may not choose for use on a musical<br/>manuscript.  Once we have made that decision, then we can decide what<br/>symbols, ASCII or otherwise, to use on a computer to simulate those<br/>that best serve the purpose for the manuscript.</p><p>&lt;&lt; ****I shudda waited, but just had to blather... &gt;&gt;</p><p>Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do!</p><p>&lt;&lt; Thanks again for the interesting discussion!   &gt;&gt;</p><p>And thank you.  Your comments have provided an opportunity for me to<br/>clarify a few things, and if we still don&apos;t agree about some of<br/>these, at least we now have a much better understanding of where<br/>we&apos;re coming from, which should help all of us in deciding where to<br/>go from here, once all is said.</p><p>And let me take this opportunity to thank everyone for making me feel<br/>at home here on the Tuning List.

I intend to show that in keyboard<br/>&gt; music, for example, it is not difficult to come up with situations<br/>in<br/>&gt; which the Sims notation not only makes the manuscript a difficult<br/>&gt; mess to encode and decipher, but at times completely breaks down in<br/>&gt; ambiguity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;&lt;  *****Now, I will have to admit that you possibly are going for<br/>a<br/>&gt; *universal, theoretical* notation that will describe *MANY*<br/>different<br/>&gt; systems.  &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now you&apos;re beginning to step back and get the big picture.  If we<br/>&gt; have one notation for 72, another for 31, something else for 41,<br/>&gt; something else for 22, etc., etc., imagine the learning curve (and<br/>&gt; potential confusion) this poses for someone attracted to<br/>&gt; microtonality, but who hasn&apos;t decided where to start.</p><p>I&apos;m anticipating a big problem that John deL., I, probably Margo S.,<br/>and others may very well end up having with your final proposal:</p><p>We feel that common-practice notation came up ESSENTIALLY in a<br/>meantone tuning, and its 5-limit approximations could NEVER be<br/>adequately notated in a system like 41 or 72. You&apos;ll have the &quot;comma<br/>problem&quot; to contend with, and precious little Western common-practice<br/>music is unaffected by it.</p><p>From a more general mathematical viewpoint, though perhaps a bit<br/>too &quot;theoretical&quot; for many, 5-limit diatonicism (i.e. common<br/>practice) not only requires, but IS DEFINED BY, the vanishing of the<br/>comma 81:80 -- and then the chromatic alterations represent the<br/>remaining unison vector, 25:24. Canasta, on the other hand, IS<br/>DEFINED BY the vanishing of 225:224, 385:384, and 441:440 (for<br/>example), and the remaining unison vector, 81:80, which would<br/>function as the &quot;chromatic alteration&quot;.</p><p>I suspect Gene will have rather similar reactions once your final<br/>notational proposal is put forward . . . but I&apos;m only guessing as to<br/>what it is! I know Gene feels, like I do, that there IS NO 5-limit<br/>diatonicism in 22-tET, for example. While 19-tET sounds just great<br/>for common-practice diatonic music, any attempt to render it (except<br/>for very special cases) in 22-tET leaves some of us extremely queasy.</p><p>Take all this as my 2&cent; only.</p><p>Cheers!</p></div><h3><a id=33045 href="#33045">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2002 4:58:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi George,</p><p>I&apos;ll probably have a *lot* more to say about your notational<br/>proposal after I&apos;ve studied it more.

Certain intervals such as fifths and fourths will<br/>be less accurate, and some commas will be disregarded, but the result<br/>might well be a &quot;reasonable facsimile&quot; of the original composition.</p><p>Translating from a tuning system where a given comma is dispersed, to<br/>one where it is observed, can be a considerably more problematic<br/>endeavor. Going from 31-EDO, approached in a Renaissance meantone<br/>style, to 72-EDO, is an obvious example.</p><p>Then, again, traditional notations also give one the means to make<br/>translations where treading with caution might be well advised --<br/>unless the purpose is experimentation and play for its own sake, an<br/>invaluable means of &quot;research and development.&quot;</p><p>Also, one might want to consider the possibility for freer<br/>translations negotiated by flexible-pitch ensembles (e.g. strings,<br/>brass, and of course human voices) where comma issues might be<br/>finessed by the kind of &quot;adaptive tuning&quot; often discussed here.</p><p>What saggital notation provides is a new approach for complex types of<br/>systems with a large number of steps and degrees of alteration, and<br/>also a new outlook which can place other approaches in a richer<br/>perspective, giving us a larger set of choices.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=33090 href="#33090">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/23/2002 4:16:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

According to Mark Lindley (_Mathematical Models of Musical<br/>&gt; Scales: A New Approach_) there is evidence that Pythagorean<br/>&gt; tuning was used in the 1300-1400s (Margo can give more accurate<br/>&gt; dates) in such a way that the &quot;diminished 4th&quot; (&quot;Fb&quot; if 1/1=&quot;C&quot;)<br/>&gt; served as the &quot;major 3rd&quot;, creating in effect a schismic<br/>temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you can see from the data I posted:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; JI/schismic:   3^-8      = 8192/6561  =  384.3599931<br/>&gt; &gt; 53-EDO JI:     2^(17/53)              =  384.9056604<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; both the Pythgorean &quot;diminished 4th&quot; *and* 53-EDO are quite close<br/>&gt; to the 5-limit &quot;major 3rd&quot; with ratio 5:4 = ~386.3137139 cents.<br/>&gt; The difference between 5/4 and 8192/6561 is the *skhisma*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/schisma.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/schisma.htm</a><br/>&gt; (definition #2)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hence the name of the temperament.  (Ellis deliberately spelled<br/>&gt; it &quot;skhisma&quot;, but &quot;schisma&quot; is more common.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also note what I have to say about 12-EDO here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/schismic.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/schismic.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The standard 12-EDO tuning is unique in that it is both a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; schismic (-1 schisma) and a meantone (-1/11-comma) temperament,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; meaning that it equates 5:4 [== 5^1] with both 81:64 [== 3^4]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and 8192:6561 [== 3^-8].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Understanding this is the key to understanding what Wilson<br/>&gt; is talking about here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;On the Development of Intonational Systems by Extended Linear<br/>Mapping&quot;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/xen3b.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/xen3b.PDF</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wilson prefers to keep his theory generalized so that it may work<br/>&gt; with temperaments as well as Pythagorean/JI/extended-JI, so I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; raise &quot;gen&quot; (for &quot;generator&quot;) to various powers here, instead of<br/>&gt; using 3 as the base.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wilson is saying that *because* of the fact that Western culture<br/>&gt; has been using 12-EDO, which can map the &quot;major 3rd&quot; to *either*<br/>&gt; gen^4 or gen^-8, we&apos;re *used* to the &quot;major 3rd&quot; being interpreted<br/>&gt; as either of those linear mappings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The standard paradigm for several centuries now has been to map<br/>&gt; the &quot;major 3rd&quot; to gen^4, but Wilson sees it as advantageous that<br/>&gt; we already use a scale that may also map it to gen^-8, thus<br/>&gt; leaving the door open for accepting other tunings which also<br/>&gt; do this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I&apos;ve misinterpreted Wilson here (entirely possible), then<br/>&gt; someone who knows better should please speak up!<br/>&gt; (Kriag?, Paul?, Carl?, John Chalmers?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See also Graham&apos;s &quot;schismic temperament&quot; page:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/schismic.htm">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/schismic.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In that case, then, there would really be *still* no difference<br/>&gt; &gt; between Pythagorean and 53-tET... ??<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Where did I get off??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Joe, be careful.  There *is* a difference between 53-EDO and<br/>&gt; Pythagorean, albeit an extremely tiny one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 53-EDO is calculated as roots of prime-factor 2, and Pythagorean<br/>&gt; is combinations of powers of prime-factors 2 and 3.  Because of<br/>&gt; the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/fundo.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/fundo.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FundamentalTheoremofArithmetic.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FundamentalTheoremofArithmetic.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; we know that primes are incommensurate: no non-zero power of any<br/>&gt; prime will ever exactly equal any non-zero power of any other prime.<br/>&gt; (Zero powers always equal one.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So there is no way that 53-EDO and Pythagorean can ever be *exactly*<br/>&gt; the same.  But they have many intervals that are extremely close in<br/>&gt; size.  You&apos;re getting confused because you&apos;re ignoring those tiny<br/>&gt; differences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for your previous post,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is fascinating.  Might be worth a 53-tET webpage *all its<br/>&gt; &gt; own*...  I was looking for that over at &quot;your place&quot; and didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; see anything like that...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Absolutely, 53-EDO definitely deserves a page of its own!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was more interested in 53-EDO back when I was more heavily<br/>&gt; into JI ... since getting on the tuning list and becoming<br/>&gt; more interested in temperaments, it&apos;s been on the back burner.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a heavy interest in the &quot;common-practice&quot; repertoire,<br/>&gt; specifically Mozart, Beethoven, and Mahler.  You have to base<br/>&gt; this repertoire on meantone and not Pythag/JI, so these days<br/>&gt; I&apos;m more interested in 19-, 31- and 55-EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hopefully I&apos;ll get around to making the 53-EDO page.<br/>&gt; Actually, this post and my last one are probably already<br/>&gt; a good start!

We&apos;re<br/>likely talking about adaptive tuning, which I much agree could be<br/>relevant either for classic JI (in practice), or for a system like<br/>72-EDO.</p><p>Secondly, thank you for mentioning 25:21, a ratio I hadn&apos;t considered,<br/>and had a bit of fun trying to guesstimate as 5:4 less 21:20, giving<br/>something close to 300 cents, or exactly that in a 72-EDO version of<br/>the secorian temperament, as I call it (in lower case, since there are<br/>a number of Secorian temperaments, but not all generated by secors).</p><p>An interesting thing about the 6:5 vs. 25:21 question is that while<br/>6:5 is the simpler ratio, 21:25 if presented as part of 42:50:63 would<br/>approximate 16:19 in 16:19:24, possibly actually having a more<br/>&quot;rooted&quot; or conclusive effect than 10:12:15.</p><p>Anyway, I agree that while mapping both the secorian types we&apos;re<br/>considering to a 310-cent interval in 1/4-comma meantone (or something<br/>very slightly smaller, I guess, in 31-EDO, actually still a rounded<br/>310 according to Scala) could be &quot;tolerable,&quot; it wouldn&apos;t necessarily<br/>be optimal for a composer who wants either a somewhat more &quot;impure&quot;<br/>minor third, or possible a more &quot;rooted&quot; one in connection with the<br/>fifth (the near-16:19:24 effect).</p><p>This nuance reminds me a bit about my own liking for the alternative<br/>or supraminor third in 29-EDO at 331 cents, very close to 23:19.<br/>Mapping it to either 310 cents or 348 cents in 31-EDO seems to me not<br/>the most accurate representation; in 72-EDO, or 36-EDO for that<br/>matter, I&apos;d be happy with 333.33 cents.</p><p>A curiosity: 25:21 is the mediant of 6:5 and 19:16, while 23:19 is the<br/>mediant of 6:5 and 17:14.</p><p>Anyway, thank you for your comments, to which I hope this is a fair<br/>response.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=33174 href="#33174">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>1/25/2002 3:11:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:3C509FAD.5F1A470A@anaphoria.com">3C509FAD.5F1A470A@anaphoria.com</a>&gt;<br/>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt;     I think it was helmholtz who noticed and as G smith pointed out<br/>&gt; that if you go down to Fb in<br/>&gt; 3/2 it is a almost a 5/4. a schisma difference.

This<br/>means that even though a cycle of 53 perfect fifths comes out<br/>very close to closing, which probably implied to you that it is<br/>almost the same as Pythagorean, all you have to do to get a major<br/>third that is almost perfect after climbing four perfect fifths is to<br/>drop back one step.</p><p>All the 5-limit intervals are approximated to an accuracy of + - 3<br/>cents as I recall (shooting from seat-of-the-pants memory.

This<br/>&gt; means that even though a cycle of 53 perfect fifths comes out<br/>&gt; very close to closing, which probably implied to you that it is<br/>&gt; almost the same as Pythagorean, all you have to do to get a major<br/>&gt; third that is almost perfect after climbing four perfect fifths is<br/>to<br/>&gt; drop back one step.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All the 5-limit intervals are approximated to an accuracy of + - 3<br/>&gt; cents as I recall (shooting from seat-of-the-pants memory. The<br/>&gt; perfect fifth, major third, and minor third, and their inversions<br/>by<br/>&gt; implication, are well within this tolerance, maybe even less than<br/>two<br/>&gt; cents off. Don&apos;t have my calculator handy right now.</p><p>Thanks, Bob, for the clarification!</p><p>JP</p></div>
