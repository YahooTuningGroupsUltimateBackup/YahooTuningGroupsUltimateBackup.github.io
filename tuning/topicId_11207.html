Here you have Vivaldi, and the<br/>&quot;smiling baby&quot; :), smiling, ostensibly at one of the pillars of Western<br/>Civilization, and then next, in the sound examples, something else...<br/>non-Western, sounding like Cage prepared piano, maybe Partch, maybe even<br/>Kraig himself.  This was the music that the commentator called the<br/>&quot;irritant&quot; to the baby.  Mad baby, sad baby :(  Poop.</p><p>Isn&apos;t this all a bit simplistic??  But what can we expect from our &quot;mass<br/>media.&quot;  I guess the &quot;upside&quot; is that it was a topic that at least went<br/>from Newsweek to the Tuning List!<br/>___________ ______ ____ ___ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
