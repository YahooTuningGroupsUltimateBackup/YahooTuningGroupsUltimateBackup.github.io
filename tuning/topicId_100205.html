Surprisingly enough, while I was making a comma pump example for fifive, I realized that the following was the case for both sixix and fifive:<br/>- A) When going from major to minor, the root pitch falls by a minor third.<br/>- B) When going back to major, the root pitch rises by a fourth.<br/>When I tried to find out what was going on here, I discovered this:<br/>If you make a pitch progression like &quot;2/1, 5/6, 5/6, 5/6, 4/3, 5/6, 5/6&quot;, you end up at 3125/2916, which is tempered out in sixix. If you then rise by one more 4/3, you arrive at 3125/2187, which is one untempered half-octave period in fifive. I really didn&apos;t know that that was the case at the time I first thought of &quot;fifive&quot;. And now I&apos;m just surprised. Well, that&apos;s the way things happen, sometimes.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ve promissed to let you hear a comma pump example in fifive. So here it is:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/PetrParizek/Fifive_pump.mid">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/PetrParizek/Fifive_pump.mid</a></p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=100208 href="#100208">ðŸ”—</a>Petr Pa&#x159;&#xED;zek &#x3C;petrparizek2000@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2011 3:24:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; - A) When going from major to minor, the root pitch falls by a minor &gt; third.<br/>&gt; - B) When going back to major, the root pitch rises by a fourth.</p><p>I should have said:<br/>When going from minor to major, the root pitch rises by a fourth, while in all the other cases it falls by a minor third.<br/>Interestingly enough, this seems to be true for sixix, porcupine, unicorn, and semisixths as well -- and I&apos;ll surely find other examples if I go on making MIDI renditions of comma pumps.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
