I&apos;ve mostly worked out of the solo violin sonatas/partitas, cello sonatas, and lute suites (which overlap the other two in places)...I&apos;ve read through many of those works numerous times, but my gift is not as a classical guitarist, so I never performed them (except for the Prelude from violin partita # 3, which I can get through). But, I&apos;ve learned a great deal about chord movement, voice leading, bass lines, and many other musical concepts. And, the great Cream bassist Jack Bruce said in a Guitar Player interview once, that Bach wrote the best bass lines, and if you wanted to learn bass, study the Art of Fugue.<br/>   And, since I do play guitar, I listened to an awful lot of guitarists play Bach, including Segovia, Christopher Parkening, John Williams, Julian Bream, Eliot Fisk, Kazuhito Yamashita, Liona Boyd, Manuel Barrueco, Sharon Isbin, and others...and every one of them played in 12 tone equal temperament, and the music sounded just great to me. I started studying tuning about 1989, and a few years later began to understand about mean tone, well temps and such...and then realized that Bach used well temps instead of eq (well, maybe he DID use 12 tone eq at times, since he wrote for lute, and had a lute/clavier, as well as a real lute...there&apos;s absolutely no compelling reason why he wouldn&apos;t have tweaked his clavier into 12 to see what the lute works would sound like...plus, he jammed with SL Weiss, and maybe other lutenists as well). And yet, his music still sounds superb to me in 12 eq...I listen to Kazuhito and Fisk a great deal, and they play his music with great understanding and depth of feeling. I&apos;m not sure it would sound or feel any better if they used a well temp.<br/>   And, I find it astonishing that there is so much time spent debating just what tuning Bach used, when, the real truth is, nobody knows...and unless some undiscovered documents appear, we never will. So, as we&apos;ve seen, there are passionate defenses of this or that tuning concept, but...nobody knows...nobody. It&apos;s all opinions; yes, intelligent and informed, but only personal opinions. And, I, for one, am also curious about what tuning concepts were going on in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and other places at the same time...but, there&apos;s very little discussion of this subject. Not a big deal, either, just an observation. Bach is a great icon to me, my favorite musician, but there were a hell of a lot of great players back then, on many instruments, but they often seem of little importance on this list. That&apos;s kind of a shame, because I would like to learn more about what was going on back in that era, and I know there&apos;s some sharp folks here who probably have info on that...so if they ever want to speak up, I&apos;m all ears...and fingers...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>  <a href="http://agenturadellarte.net">agenturadellarte.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=68925 href="#68925">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>1/12/2007 7:44:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Neil,</p><p>Do you think there is a relationship between all the ET you have learned for Bach and the lack of commitment to determining his most likely tuning?  I really don&apos;t mean to psychoanalyze, but the same has beeen suggested to Aaron, and many others before.</p><p>When the mind is developed with a single pattern of reference, including a single religion, and all the many stage fixations, etc., it is like a habit that won&apos;t break.  It&apos;s probably the reason why those with perfect pitch are so anxious about new pitch relationships.  But they have the glue to take on the new intervals that the rest of us do not.</p><p>From my listening perspective, Bach makes true sense in Werckmeister III.  And I know that any of the other well temperaments are going to sound to me more like WIII than to ET.  This is the central issue to understanding Western Art Music, in my opinion.</p><p>Have you played or heard John Dowland in Dowland&apos;s Irregular Temperament?  Wim Hoogewerf served up some examples.  It is exquisite.  How can anyone hearing Dowland&apos;s music in what his son, Robert, declared was his father John Dowland&apos;s tuning, again in ET?  Same with Bach.</p><p>Discussion on this list about BAD pythagorean intervals are part of Church service, and yet this has been ignored by correspondents.  ET is part of Werckmeister III in terms of near identical keys, and this has been ignored.  Choosing nothing over something as a base tuning, when historically accurate and nearly identical to its althernatives, as agreed to by Herr Kellner on this list, is to ignore the genuine tradition of a non-ET chromaticism in Bach&apos;s country.  Some of us are passionate about this.</p><p>best johnny<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.

Not everyone who doesn&apos;t follow *your*<br/>reasoning is a dispassionate Bach fan. Not everyone who doesn&apos;t follow<br/>*your* reasoning is a failed steward of Bach&apos;s intentions. And not<br/>everyone shares your apparant obsessive hatred of 12-equal, and music<br/>written for it, or adapted to it, as it were.</p><p>Given a choice, of course, I&apos;d rather hear Bach in historical<br/>veracity. However, for instance, I wouldn&apos;t burn all piano<br/>performances, which still have things to teach. Dinu Lipatti. Edwin<br/>Fischer. Of course, Glenn Gould (love him or hate him, he is a huge<br/>reason we even consider Bach today). Martha Argerich. Roslyn Tureck.<br/>Andras Schiff. Daniel Barenboim. I&apos;m sure I forget others. There are<br/>of course, also really irritating 19th-century Bach conceptions on the<br/>piano that are piggish. But to dismiss Bach experiences in 12-, or<br/>near 12-equal is really fundamentalism of the worst kind. (Plus, the<br/>timbre of the piano, for me, lasts longer without irritation than does<br/>the harpsichord, but I digress).</p><p>I was listening to Art Tatum last night. This guy was probably the<br/>greatest keyboard player who ever lived, and I&apos;m including all the<br/>great composer/keyboardists and interpreters in any genre you can<br/>throw at me (there&apos;s wide agreement that he was the single greatest<br/>jazz instumentalist ever), and I seriously doubt he gave a single<br/>thought his who life to the issue of tuning or temperament. He was to<br/>preoccupied with being the miracle player he was, and that&apos;s Neil&apos;s<br/>point, I would think. And guess what? He played in 12-equal, or<br/>however closely a tuner could get to it, his whole life. Should we<br/>ignore the phenomenon that was Art Tatum, because his contrapuntal<br/>lines aren&apos;t &quot;etched out&quot; in WerckIII clarity? (whatever do you mean<br/>by that, Johnny?---I still am trying to figure out what you mean)</p><p>&gt;  I really don&apos;t mean to psychoanalyze, but the same has beeen<br/>&gt; suggested to Aaron, and many others before.</p><p>But you *are* psychoanalyzing, inappropriately and badly, and again,<br/>mainly because very few of us have drank your &quot;WerckIII-only for Bach,<br/>please&quot; cool-aid, and that makes you upset.</p><p>If it makes you feel any better, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s appropriate for<br/>*anyone* to say with 100% certainty, as you do, that Bach&apos;s tuning was<br/>X. Lehman shouldn&apos;t, you shouldn&apos;t, Kellner shouldn&apos;t, I shouldn&apos;t.<br/>There is no direct evidence. It&apos;s certainly appropriate to share<br/>enthusiasm for a likely candidate, and share your reasoning; but don&apos;t<br/>be surprised when you lash out and attack those whose views differ if<br/>you don&apos;t get converts. And in my book, tuning *can* be an important<br/>element of Bach interpretation, but it takes a big-time backseat to<br/>technical mastery and accuracy, tempi, articuation, ensemble, phrasing<br/>subtlety, nuance, energy, affect, and overall intellectual and<br/>emotional engagement. If the tuning highlights the music and makes the<br/>textures shimmer in a way that augments the prerequisite elements,<br/>then great--icing on the cake!</p><p>&gt; When the mind is developed with a single pattern of reference,<br/>&gt; including a single religion, and all the many stage fixations, etc.,<br/>&gt; it is like a habit that won&apos;t break.</p><p>Now, take that insight, and look at yourself regarding your belief<br/>about WerckIII...notice anything?</p><p>&lt;SNIP&gt;</p><p>&gt; Discussion on this list about BAD pythagorean intervals are part of<br/>&gt; Church service, and yet this has been ignored by correspondents.

Some of us are passionate about this.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand. If WerckIII is so close to some other, milder WTs<br/>that have been proposed, why do make such a stink about the issue?</p><p>Another question--What, in your opinion, is the driving force behind<br/>the progressive mellowing of WTs as they went, in historical<br/>evolution? Can you tell me why you think it *wasn&apos;t* to tame the<br/>Pythagorean thirds in remoter keys?</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron</p></div><h3><a id=68935 href="#68935">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>1/12/2007 6:59:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron, there is no hate for ET on my part.

When music is essentially the stacking of one melody over another and others, like with JS Bach, there are certain rules that were established to insure good music writing.  In fact, Werckmeister wrote lots about this in his other, less known works.  When an unequal tuning is used, the lines stand out a bit more, as if the keyboard had some of the &ldquo;English&rdquo; that a violinst has at their disposal.  It really fits well with JS&rsquo;s having full musical control of his players, writing out ornaments, eradicating improvisation, and with unequal tuning there is more control of sentiment.  Read about sentiment in Kirnberger&rsquo;s book the art of composition.   By not crossing voices, and by virtue of the indiosyncratic varieties of intervals sizes, the voices are &ldquo;etched&rdquo; more to the ear in WIII.  This would be true is most any well temperament, but WIII is more gradated in its variegation.</p><p>Aaron, you point out that the variation gets smoother.  I agree.  But once again, it has nothing to do with Bach.  Taming melodic Pythagorean thirds to be better harmonic thirds was a trend, but again, it has nothing to do with the time of Bach.</p><p>Bach is a microtonalist because he was able to use 39 different melodic intervals at a time when there were only those available in a limited extended meantone.  To a modern ear drenched in ET, it seems a primitive throwback, better served by the ET you know than the WT you don&rsquo;t.</p><p>If you had to choose a tuning for the Brandenberg #2, it would not get performed, I guess.  You have not been able to give a tuning to tune the harpsichord into, and so the piece would not get played.  There are no Brandenberg Concerti performed in anything but ET and WIIII.  In other words, if you are so sure that anything is better than WIII and yet cannot give a plausible, actual tuning, there would be no performance.  Since I have recorded Brandenberg #2 in WIII, you have a chance to compare it to any ET tuned performance and to listen for the distinctions.  Or, you could continue blowing hot air.</p><p>Johnny<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.
