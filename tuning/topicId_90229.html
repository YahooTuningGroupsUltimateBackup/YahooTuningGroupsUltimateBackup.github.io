Every chord is the same. It is a BP power chord if you will.<br/>Slight, and I do mean slight tuning changes due to the JI<br/>implementation of BP here but the same chord. .&quot;<br/>  Odd...for example at 1:48 it sounds quite resolved to me and at 1:53 it just suddenly jumps out and bites with sudden sharp dissonance without warning.  Same goes where around 0:40-0:41 it sounds resolved and at 0:44 it bites and at 0:46 it randomly goes back to quite resolved.<br/>  I can believe you there are &quot;transposed&quot; power chords (at least in the background) but some of the combination of those and the lead lines seems to make the songs consonance/dissonance contrasts &quot;bump&quot; rather than flow to my ears.</p><p>  Again not saying it&apos;s you...I&apos;ve tried to tame BP myself and looked at many other attempts...just haven&apos;t found anything that works beyond the field of math and into that of emotion.</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2010 8:31:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, you can&apos;t judge a chord played by one instrument by including<br/>every other instrument sounding. The chord progression I worked out a<br/>bit and the bass a bit less, and the wrist slitting lead was<br/>improvisation #2 so there are notes I&apos;d take back. I might be able to<br/>post just the chord progression - though I see no use since you are<br/>dead against BP.</p><p>So.. *my* point is the chords are good. BP could do a passable rock<br/>song IMHO. And to be honest I like Elaine&apos;s BP work. Some of the video<br/>pieces from the conference end up being really good in my opinion<br/>after an occasional slow start.</p><p>Chris</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Mike. Every chord is the same.
