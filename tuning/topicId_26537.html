I know a little something about dynamics, but nothing at all<br/>about steel cylinders beyond what I can try to visualize.  I believe<br/>that the lowest, and most audible, frequencies will be produced by<br/>deformation of the circular shape.  This frequency would rise as the<br/>thickness of the steel rises, but would be independent of the length of<br/>the cylinder.</p><p>Hope this helps.  Sorry, I&apos;m not sure what the &quot;Bell&quot; and &quot;Bar&quot; modes<br/>are, though one of them (&quot;Bar&quot;?) is sure to be the bending of the<br/>cylinder along its length.  I&apos;d expect this to be supersonic for any<br/>reasonable cylinder.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
