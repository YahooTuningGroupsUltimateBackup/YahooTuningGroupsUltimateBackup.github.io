I do realize that it is supposed to be tuned using Pure Tone or Just Intonation.  The problem is that I do not know much about JI or how to go about it.  Is there anyone out there who can help me out?  Especially another Sitar player.  What should I use as a frequency source?  Or anything else I should know to do the job properly.  I want my Sitar to sound harmonically pure as it should be.</p><p>Lloyd Jessee</p></div><h3>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@bellsouth.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/24/1999 2:02:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Traditional SA is 240 hz<br/>Use a computer to generate a C at 240hz for C or 272 for C#<br/>and Just tune up from there<br/>or consult Alain Danielou books , Ray Tomes&apos; website has a neat graphic<br/>60 hz is usuallty the base though<br/>but it differs of course from gharana to gharana<br/>Pat<br/>btw I have my sitar tine to 7 limit JI just with a 17/16 at the re<br/>komal==<br/>sounds real close to Shankar&apos;s</p><p>Lloyd Jessee wrote:</p><p>&gt;  Hello all, I play Sitar, and am currently using a chromatic guitar<br/>&gt; tuner to tune it with.

There&apos;s 8 presets but also room for 2 user<br/>defined tunings. Between the two you should have enough<br/>room for the 22 tone Sruti scale of Indian music.<br/>I paid $300 for mine at the local Guitar Center.</p><p>As for learning JI, I always recommend David Doty&apos;s<br/>Just Intonation Primer.
