I do realize that it is supposed to be tuned using Pure Tone or Just Intonation.  The problem is that I do not know much about JI or how to go about it.  Is there anyone out there who can help me out?  Especially another Sitar player.  What should I use as a frequency source?  Or anything else I should know to do the job properly.

There&apos;s 8 presets but also room for 2 user<br/>defined tunings. Between the two you should have enough<br/>room for the 22 tone Sruti scale of Indian music.<br/>I paid $300 for mine at the local Guitar Center.</p><p>As for learning JI, I always recommend David Doty&apos;s<br/>Just Intonation Primer.
