I was responding to a post from Graham Breed in which he (I<br/>think) is advocating a fixed number of pitches per octave, in meantone.</p><p>Just a few lines up from the ones you quote, I wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Adaptive tuning works best, I agree, when one has the whole pitch<br/>&gt;&gt; spectrum available.</p><p>and</p><p>&gt;&gt; Why does it matter that you have more than 12 notes per octave,<br/>&gt;&gt; especially if your INPUT is still 12/octave?</p><p>Perhaps you missed those lines?</p><p>I would never imply that it is not possible to stretch meantone.<br/>Nevertheless, having taken the trouble to equip myself with the means to<br/>tune in real-time, I choose to tune in JI.  Why cramp the fifths to get<br/>good thirds when that trade-off is not necessary?</p><p>&gt; Dave Keenan&apos;s dynamic retuning program allows one to use the 12 keys<br/>&gt; of the keyboard to realize the limitless (actually, in his case, a<br/>&gt; closed cycle of 31) modulation possibilities of meantone.</p><p>I will check that out.  It&apos;s on his web site, I assume?</p><p>I just reviewed the math of 31-tET, and see that it is almost PERFECTLY<br/>aligned with 1/4 comma meantone.  There is a part of me that takes great<br/>delight in this kind of ET game.  By narrowing the fifths, 31-tET<br/>finesses the comma problem of the I-vi-ii-V-I progression, unlike 22-tET<br/>and others: there is no microtonal motion.  Still, 5.18 cents error in<br/>the fifth is hard for me to swallow: I love the peaceful pure open fifth<br/>when it&apos;s well-tuned (even better than 12-tET&apos;s modest 1.96 cents error<br/>if possible - and, of course, it IS possible...).</p><p>JdL</p></div>
