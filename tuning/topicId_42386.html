Concerning the<br/>&gt; patenting of scales:  Back in the late &apos;70&apos;s Tom Stone<br/>&gt; tried to patent some interchangeable fretboards with<br/>&gt; JI scales and was told by the U.S. Patent Office that<br/>&gt; they did not grant patents on musical scales.  He<br/>&gt; ended up getting a patent for the interchangeability<br/>&gt; feature of his fretboards.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suspect that <a href="http://FretWave.com">FretWave.com</a> has received a patent on<br/>&gt; &quot;frets which curve&quot; or some such concept, rather than<br/>&gt; a patent on a musical scale.  Also, it may be a<br/>&gt; separate type of patent called a &quot;Design Patent&quot; which<br/>&gt; has specifications which are different from those of a<br/>&gt; standard patent.  Anyone who would like to know the<br/>&gt; details of their patent can order a copy of the patent<br/>&gt; from the Patent Office for a dollar.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                            --Mark Rankin<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- Joel Rodrigues &lt;<a href="mailto:jdrodrigues@Phreaker.net">jdrodrigues@Phreaker.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; On Thursday, February 27, 2003, at 04:09 ,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mark Rankin &lt;<a href="mailto:markrankin95511@yahoo.com">markrankin95511@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: guitar frets<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Two and a half years ago Glen Peterson told Siemen<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Terpstra and me about how he had been warned by a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; competetor not to create any more of his curved<br/>&gt; &gt; frets.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have just tuned in to the current discussion<br/>&gt; &gt; today<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and haven&apos;t got the data on who the culprit is but<br/>&gt; &gt; if<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it can be of any help, over ten years ago french<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; microtonalist Jacques Dudon built what he called a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sruti Guitar&quot; fretted in Just intonation.  He<br/>&gt; &gt; said<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that it sounded so absolutely beautiful that<br/>&gt; &gt; everyone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; who heard him play it wanted to buy it from him!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; He sent me photos of it.  Instead of the straight<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; frets in a staggered configuration that I use on<br/>&gt; &gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interchangeable fretboards, Jacques used a<br/>&gt; &gt; combination<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of serpentine frets that he curved himself, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; straight frets.
