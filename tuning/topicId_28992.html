<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>An Idea and Project</h1><h3>Mike Leahy &#x3C;catharsis@egregious.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/9/2001 1:23:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello,</p><p>I just subbed back on after taking a few months off from the tuning list [ I<br/>was the one with the mohawk at this years microfest; no mohawk anymore :( ]. I<br/>am still in the initial process of getting through tuning basics and relating<br/>it to my other areas of musical interest (computer music, studio technique,<br/>etc.). I had the opportunity to study in Paris at CCMIX (<a href="http://www.ccmix.com">www.ccmix.com</a>) this<br/>summer. It was a truly wonderful experience that helped me grasp the<br/>compositional imperative of 20th century and the connections to computer music<br/>among other aspects.</p><p>I am writing with great excitement as I have been able to get through the doors<br/>of my university music department and setup an independent project using Kyma.<br/>Before I had no luck accessing the resources of my university as the doors were<br/>shut as I am a CSC major and the State university I attend is not open to cross<br/>discipline activities. I have 60 hours (6 a week) booked this fall on the Kyma<br/>system. I had access to a Kyma system while at CCMIX, so I have a decent<br/>understanding in regard to operation.</p><p>This is my conception of the project I am going to undertake and would really<br/>like some feedback or suggestions on references to prior work to look into:</p><p>I have taken interest in the chapter &apos;Consonance and Scales&apos; by John Pierce<br/>found in Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound -- An Introduction to<br/>Psychoacoustics and plan to work from ideas generated from this source.</p><p>Here is an insightful quote: &quot;Clearly the phenomenon of consonance depends on<br/>the coincidence of the partials of different tones rather than on the<br/>numerological properties of integers.&quot;</p><p>I am interested in exploring the relationship of consonance and dissonance of<br/>tuning systems based around electronic processes. Despite the numerological<br/>lattices that I have been overwhelmed with in the literature I have I believe<br/>that they alone do not establish proper control over consonance or dissonance<br/>in any completely meaningful and useful way for electronic composition. It is<br/>my understanding that the partials/overtones of a particular instrument<br/>(electronic) establish how consonant or how dissonant the relation will be<br/>instead of just integer ratios. IE a square wave will have a congregation of<br/>higher partials compared to a triangle wave. It is when these partials do not<br/>match in chords that causes dissonance. Of course this changes between all<br/>instruments and particular electronic sound sources despite the fundamental<br/>frequency.</p><p>I plan to create a Kyma patch that is based around the sample convolution<br/>example. I hope to manipulate the frequency spectra of one source (IE control<br/>the partials) and apply it onto an evolving microsound structure. I hope to<br/>create a decent interface to such a patch through using the Peavey PC1600x and<br/>Doepfer Drehbank (possibly midi note input too), so that it may be used for<br/>real time performance. I am more than willing to put my work up in public<br/>domain as I hope there are several people on this list that can help me with<br/>this project.</p><p>If this turns out to work decently I am interested in mapping the partials<br/>behind any particular sound source in relation to a scale lattice. A 3d<br/>interface would be useful for this line of inquiry where groups of notes may be<br/>coordinated visually and their partials manipulated to get inside a particular<br/>scale structure. Micro-microtonal music... ;)</p><p>Anyway, that is what I am up to this fall and would really like some input as<br/>the topic of tuning is still new to me. I have a vision (sounds in head) of<br/>being able to dynamically filter and effect (delay) partials in the frequency<br/>domain and apply them to textural sound sources. IE you could take a simple<br/>chord and move it dynamically from consonance to dissonance over time while the<br/>frequency spectra is convolved on to a related or unrelated textural source<br/>that is also evolving.</p><p>Much respect and I hope all is well...<br/>--Mike Leahy (aka Catharsis)</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>10/10/2001 9:47:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:9pvqbm+k0q7@eGroups.com">9pvqbm+k0q7@eGroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Jacky wrote:</p><p>&gt; Again, I say that to think about finding an optimal alignment of<br/>&gt; partials for one instrument is one thing (and rather easy to do with<br/>&gt; software these days), but to find a good scale for a number of mixed<br/>&gt; inharmonic partials is yet another endeavor all together.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have at least two solutions to this, which I would love to discuss<br/>&gt; with you - or anyone interested - here or, we can try again on MMM.</p><p>I&apos;m interested.

If so, what you&apos;re talking about here is<br/>covered in the chapter, _Helmholtz and Consonance_. But please be<br/>sure to read the next chapter too: _Rameau and Harmony_. You&apos;ll see<br/>how some of these assumptions fell apart in Pierce&apos;s later<br/>investigations!</p><p>&gt; I am interested in exploring the relationship of consonance and<br/>dissonance of<br/>&gt; tuning systems based around electronic processes.

The<br/>lattices we use around here have a very strong psychoacoustic basis!</p><p>&gt; It is<br/>&gt; my understanding that the partials/overtones of a particular<br/>instrument<br/>&gt; (electronic) establish how consonant or how dissonant the relation<br/>will be<br/>&gt; instead of just integer ratios.

Some<br/>of us have, and what we have found is that, while clashes between<br/>overtones have some effect on consonance, there are often more<br/>important factors. Bob Wendell, for example, has spoken at length<br/>about some of these factors here. The Pierce chapter _Rameau and<br/>Harmony_ will give you a clue as to what I mean here, as will another<br/>book: _Harmony: A Psychoacoustical Approach_ by Richard Parncutt.</p><p>Your projects sound fascinating and good luck with them!</p><p>-Paul</p></div>
