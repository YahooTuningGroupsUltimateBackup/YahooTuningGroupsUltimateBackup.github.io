To wit, a<br/>discography of microtonic compositions.</p><p>But there&apos;s one possible contender for this list that wasn&apos;t there, an album<br/>I&apos;ve been trying to remember the details of unsuccessfully for years. It<br/>seems that, around 1960-something, when the boom of &quot;authentic&quot; performances<br/>of Baroque music was getting under weigh, someone did a spoof ultra-authentic<br/>version of Handel&apos;s Water Music, a performance with certain microtonic<br/>features, to say the least.</p><p>Side one of the LP was a long lecture, with musical examples, of how various<br/>instruments must have sounded when played on, e.g., brass instruments without<br/>keys. The natural overtone series, the lecturer asserted, might sound a bit<br/>pungent to our ears, but it&apos;s far more authentic a sound than we&apos;re<br/>accustomed to when we listen to the usual late-romantic orchestras trying to<br/>render the Baroque sound.</p><p>After the lecturer toured all the various sections of the orchestra, the main<br/>performance began (as I recall, comprising side two of the LP). And,<br/>obviously, given that the brass players were playing on open horns, not even<br/>trying to &quot;lip&quot; to the notes printed in Handel&apos;s score, the result sounded<br/>like a marriage between an Ives evocation of rural New England on the Fourth<br/>of July on the one hand and a rabble of winos playing around in a music store<br/>on the other.</p><p>I vaguely recall this recording being mentioned some years ago in an earlier<br/>version of the tuning list. So perhaps some kindly soul will refresh my<br/>memory as to the orchestra, conductor, and maybe even label of this recording.</p><p>Mark Manning, Seattle &lt;<a href="mailto:TandMark@aol.com">TandMark@aol.com</a>&gt;</p></div>
