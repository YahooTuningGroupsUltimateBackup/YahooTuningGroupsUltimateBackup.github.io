Most pop is just three chords, etc... Todd, I&apos;m sure it works, and for dance floor stuff it is just the call. But a recent topic has been the &apos;pitfalls&apos; of MIDI, and I can think of nothing that has devalued &quot;humanization&quot; (as in the real thing) in music is that ability to cut and paste, which led to loop based sequencers (Acid on the PC platform is a good example: it *wants* to make all loops the same number of beats, not allowing easy overlapping of different length loops).</p><p>Not that these things can&apos;t be done other ways, but it&apos;s an indicator of how the technology has shaped both the homogeneity and sameness made with these tools. Listen the any great (hell, _good_) drummer and those chorus/verse patterns have a lot more subtlety than that. You&apos;ve made a good stab at it with layering (which brings in all manner of new things that a human _couldn&apos;t_ play), but there is no substitute for the finesse of nuanced ghost notes and whatnot to lend...um, *humanity*, to any musical part.</p><p>But the above is completely without hearing your music, and is made in general terms and not your music specifically. I&apos;m not a cad.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div><h3><a id=17648 href="#17648">ðŸ”—</a>Todd Wilcox &#x3C;twilcox@patriot.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/17/2001 9:55:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; About humanization, Todd wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Most drum parts are pretty much one beat for the verse and<br/>&gt; another for the<br/>&gt; &gt;chorus, so this works pretty well.</p><p>Szanto replied:<br/>&gt; Well, yeah, in *some* kinds of music.

My favorite drummer never plays the same<br/>measure twice, and he plays for a heavy metal band (Tool), which also leads<br/>to say that really the whole &quot;pop is just three chords thing,&quot; well..

Sounds like... well, lets just say it sounds<br/>terrible, but its better than nothing.</p><p>I was just trying to recommend ideas for people in the same situation who<br/>have nothing better than MIDI and a drum machine to work with. I&apos;d own a kit<br/>myself if I had any place to put it and a place to play it without getting<br/>evicted.</p><p>&quot;Dance floor stuff&quot; indeed! :)</p><p>TOdd</p></div><h3><a id=17676 href="#17676">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>1/18/2001 9:46:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I seem to have missed a digest or two.

I was answering pretty much in the abstract, and the list<br/>does have a lot of people that make music alone in their<br/>rooms/studios, and just don&apos;t want anyone to think that sequencing<br/>drum parts, or any other, is a replacement for a human doing it.</p><p>Unless you *want* un- or inhuman parts!
