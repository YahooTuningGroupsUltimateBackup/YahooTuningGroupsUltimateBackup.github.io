That&apos;s a completely<br/>&gt; different kind of issue. Let&apos;s stick to Turk-53 and Telemann-55 for<br/>&gt; this discussion, OK?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Gee, calm down, Paul.  The issue may not be as important for you as it is for<br/>me, but hey, all these things are related, at least to me.</p><p>Partch&apos;s number 43, which went through different stages, was set more for<br/>finite minds than for tuning accuracy.  Partch certainly wasn&apos;t painting<br/>himself into a corner by limiting himself to ONLY a particular 43.  It was<br/>settled upon so that finite beings would have a finite number, contrary to<br/>the Turk-53, Telemann-55, discussion.   That is why I am questioning its<br/>raison d&apos;etre.  Maybe it should be Turk-17 out o 53 and Telemann-15 out of<br/>55, etc.</p><p>The reason I brought up the story about fifths is that people (myself<br/>included) forget where people are regarding the numbers and math, let alone<br/>the musical terms for specific intervals which are inherited but no longer<br/>represent accurately what they once described (like a fifth being the &quot;fifth<br/>tone of a diatonic scale with a minimum of beating).</p><p>Best, Johnny</p></div><h3><a id=30966 href="#30966">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/3/2001 2:57:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; Maybe it should be Turk-17 out o 53</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>&gt; and Telemann-15 out of<br/>&gt; 55, etc.</p><p>15 wouldn&apos;t make sense as a place to stop. 19 or 31 would.</p><p>&gt; The reason I brought up the story about fifths is that people<br/>(myself<br/>&gt; included) forget where people are regarding the numbers and math,</p><p>Any number can mean so many things, it&apos;s damn confusing unless you&apos;re<br/>trained in a particular system (ex.: the Telemann/Tosi/Quantz/Mozart<br/>system; the Turkish system).</p><p>&gt; let alone<br/>&gt; the musical terms for specific intervals which are inherited but no<br/>longer<br/>&gt; represent accurately what they once described (like a fifth being<br/>the &quot;fifth<br/>&gt; tone of a diatonic scale with a minimum of beating).</p><p>. . . against the tonic.</p><p>Where does the term &quot;fifth&quot; no longer describe this?</p></div>
