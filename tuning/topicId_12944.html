Oh well...</p><p>I would like some recomendations on recordings of Monteverdi<br/>(and/or his contemporaries) which would really show off the<br/>pre-tonality-five-limit (mannerist?) style. Of course,<br/>authentic instruments and tunings are a big plus.</p><p>There was talk of Verlacht Nacht by Shoenberg. That<br/>composition is a treat for sure.  I would like<br/>recomendations for other  composers/compositions/<br/>recordings that are in that &apos;Romantic off the cliff&apos; veign<br/>particularly late Mahler and Liszt, which came up in that<br/>thread. Personally, I have no disagreement with the problem<br/>the early 12-tone school faced, and believe that good music<br/>did come from their solutions. My 50,000 foot vision of<br/>the thing is that the tools at hand became smaller<br/>and more refined [the major/minor system + adoption of<br/>12tet] and collided with the natural tendency of artists<br/>to &apos;push&apos; the limits of their materials. There WAS a<br/>school that may have pushed the tonal language one step<br/>further, and that was the tin-pan alley songwriters, but<br/>generally, the tonal tradition reached a cul-de-sac.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure that all the serialists are best represented by<br/>tuning in 12tet. Bergs Violin Concerto for instance is on the<br/>edge of, if not tonal then tuneable, musics. Weberns<br/>composition space spends a lot of time in and around diminished<br/>chord harmonys and melodies. It may be interesting to see<br/>whether casting it into a 5:6:7:9 system, or 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4<br/>makes the &apos;concords and discords&apos; jump out more.</p><p>[and did I understand that from a harmonic entropy, these<br/>get the same rating?]</p><p>Adaptive tuning of these pieces could and should be attempted,<br/>but I think it would need a multi-pass algorithm to determine<br/>which simultanietys should be vertically concordant or<br/>horizontally concordant (horizontally concordant being<br/>preserving melodic consistency at the expense of vertical<br/>abrasiveness). Certainly in the early serialists I&apos;ve listened<br/>to, you would need to look at dynamics, register, orchestration<br/>etc to determine which simultanietys should of &apos;repose&apos; (implying<br/>less beating tuning) and which are more energetic.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=12955 href="#12955">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2000 8:58:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure that all the serialists are best represented by<br/>&gt; tuning in 12tet.
