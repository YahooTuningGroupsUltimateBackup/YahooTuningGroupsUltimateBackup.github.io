There was almost a full<br/>house at 2:00, and a decent crowd at 7:00.</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf, a Dutch guitarist from Paris who performed<br/>three different times during this concert alone, as well<br/>as on the two other concerts of this year&apos;s festival,<br/>opened the Microthon with three Spanish pieces from the<br/>Renaissance.  I particularly liked the third one,<br/>_Fantasia que contrabaze le harpa en la menera de Ludovico_<br/>[whoever he is], from 1546.  This piece had some surprisingly<br/>modern elements in it.</p><p>All three were played in JI.</p><p>I am a fan of Wim&apos;s playing, especially when his guitar<br/>is tuned in JI, altho in this appearance and his second, he<br/>&apos;fluffed&apos; a few notes.  He performs on a guitar with grooves<br/>under each string and moveable frets for each string.</p><p>David Beardsley performed his _Sonic Bloom_ next.  This piece<br/>has sounds from a Korg synthesizer controlled by MIDI input from<br/>his electric guitar.  It&apos;s an ambient piece of long sustained<br/>tones, in a JI &apos;subharmonic&apos; tuning.  His amplifier settings were<br/>slightly off, emphasizing the bass a bit too much, but as he<br/>performed solo, he couldn&apos;t fix them once he started without<br/>stopping the performance, he decided not to do that, and the piece<br/>came off very well despite that anyway.</p><p>Next Mary Hurlbut sang along with Andrew Bolotowsky&apos;s flute<br/>in the world premiere (one of 12 listed on the program) of<br/>Franz Kamin&apos;s _People&apos;s Song_.  Altho I personally wasn&apos;t<br/>particularly moved by the style used in setting the poem<br/>(reminding me a bit of the detached style used by Boulez and<br/>the other French 1950s serialists, which I *do* like in Boulez&apos;s<br/>setting of surrealist poetry), the microtonal interplay between<br/>soprano and flute was very interesting.</p><p>Eric Nauman on electric guitar and Douglas Cohen on computer<br/>electronics performed a piece that had a Cageian element<br/>in it with Eric&apos;s turning over cards which indicated the long<br/>sustained chords he strummed on the guitar.  This was a minimal<br/>piece, and Doug&apos;s electronics were very nice.  I found the piece<br/>a bit monotonous but overall quite interesting.</p><p>Something that was tried as an experiment was the playing<br/>of tracks from CD recordings of microtonal music, in between<br/>selections, while musicians were setting up.  David Beardsley<br/>had the arduous job of staying on top of this thru-out the long<br/>day.</p><p>The first such piece given was Rick Sanford&apos;s _Nightwalking, A<br/>Fantasie_, which was a rhythmic minimalist piece that sounded to<br/>me like it was in JI, and was quite nice.</p><p>Unfortunately, after this one, members of the audience talked<br/>thru all the other CD tracks, so that the pieces functioned more<br/>as incidental background music and did not really get the attention<br/>they deserved as selections in the concert.  I agree with the<br/>suggestion from Lydia Ayers that if this format is used in the<br/>future, it would be better to announce the CD tracks as pieces<br/>and present them without the distraction of stage movement, to<br/>indicate a more attentive approach to the audience during the<br/>playing of the CDs, and then have no music at all during the<br/>equipment set-up, since most of the audience members are regular<br/>attendees to this festival who live geographically far apart and<br/>welcome the opportunity to meet and talk to each other anyway.</p><p>In fact, it may be good to encourage the audience to get up and<br/>mingle during set-up periods, especially in a concert as long as<br/>this one.</p><p>Next came Mayumi Reinhard on synthesizer giving the world<br/>premiere of _Harapba (Natural Open Field)_.  This was in a<br/>JI tuning with a steady and very rhythmic background.</p><p>Andrew Bolotowsky reappeared solo to perform Virgil Thomson&apos;s<br/>1943 piece _Sonata for Flute Alone_, ostensibly in 12-eq,<br/>which Johnny says is also microtonal (!).  It was played on<br/>a conical Boehm flute, which, Johnny argued afterwards, gave it<br/>an imperfection of intonation that qualified it as microtonal<br/>(isn&apos;t he sly!).</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf returned to play the American premiere of Alois<br/>Haba&apos;s _Suite_, op. 63, for quartertone guitar.  This was one<br/>of my favorite performances of the concert.</p><p>Next, Michiyo Suzuki performed a solo clarinet piece<br/>by Jiji Yuasa called _Solitude_, and did a magnificent job.<br/>Her playing was masterfully controlled (and I know that of<br/>which I speak: my first and main instrument was clarinet), even<br/>during the difficult double-phonics which occurred thru-out the<br/>piece, and she played some high notes that I think most clarinet<br/>teachers will tell you don&apos;t exist.</p><p>A few people complained about what was apparently a lack<br/>of oxygen in the hall, and admitted to dozing off,<br/>as I did, during the longest individual performance in<br/>the concert, Joshua Pierce&apos;s excellent rendition of<br/>John Cage&apos;s _Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano_.</p><p>Aside from that complaint, the only real *musical* criticism<br/>was that the piano itself, while not bad, was not able to do full<br/>justice to the quality of Pierce&apos;s performance - but this is<br/>a physics lecture hall and not a musical performance space.<br/>(Of course, we are all grateful to _________ for giving<br/>Johnny Reinhard access to this space.)</p><p>As David Beardsley remarked to me, this piece hints very much<br/>at the sound of a gamelan, but what struck me in this hearing<br/>was how closely some parts of it sounded like bits from<br/>Partch&apos;s later more percussive pieces, certain figures very<br/>strongly resembling, say, the diamond marimba and harmonic canon<br/>in pieces from _And On The Seventh Day Petals Fell in Petaluma_.<br/>I noticed this about midway thru, around Sonata # 8.</p><p>An intermission for Lunch followed from 1:00 to 2:00.</p><p>The piece opening the second part of the concert was Thomas<br/>Rutishauser on solo cello, performing Violetta Dinescu&apos;s<br/>_Intarsien_.  This was an intense piece, done very well by<br/>Rutishauser.  I listened in vain for familiar material to<br/>return - apparently this is a thru-composed or athematic piece,<br/>but it was done very well and was quite effective.<br/>Its intensity reminded me of Bartok at his best.</p><p>The Flux String Quartet performed two world premieres on the<br/>concert.  Incorrectly listed as &apos;Fluxus Quartet&apos; on the program,<br/>leader Tom Chiu, before their second performance, gave the<br/>correction: &apos;we appreciate Johnny&apos;s reference to our roots,<br/>i.e., the Fluxus Movement, but our name is &apos;Flux Quartet&apos;.</p><p>Their first premiere was in the one-movement _Fear_ by<br/>Al Giusto, which I thought was an excellent piece and an<br/>excellent performance, very well conjuring up different aspects<br/>of its title emotion.</p><p>This quartet gives very good performances of JI music.<br/>My only complaint, which I stated in a review after hearing<br/>them last year [see _Review of &apos;When Mozart was a 9-year-old&apos;_<br/>in Juxtaposition], is that Cornelius Duffalo, the 2nd violinist,<br/>performs with an intonation that is not quite as precise as the<br/>other members.  Unfortunately, it shows up more noticeably<br/>than it might otherwise, particularly when only the violins<br/>are playing, because Tom Chiu on 1st violin has such excellent<br/>intonation.  But at the same time, Cornelius&apos;s intonation has<br/>improved in the past year, and overall (this minor intonational<br/>quibble aside) I think both of the quartet&apos;s performances were<br/>first-rate.</p><p>Sasha Bogdanowitsch&apos;s piece _An Ocean Walks Beside a Lake_<br/>was also a world premiere.  The piece and performance were<br/>excellent. I felt that it was a little long, but perhaps that<br/>was just because of the context of the 11-hour concert in itself.<br/>I was told later that, in the form presented today, it was just<br/>a subset of the entire piece.  But given the length of the concert<br/>in its totality, there was a section in Sasha&apos;s piece<br/>where there was a clear break and I felt the performance<br/>could have concluded.</p><p>That said, let me emphasize the positive aspects of this<br/>wonderful work.  Sasha&apos;s piece was for his own live voice<br/>(with invented-language syllables and dance movements) plus<br/>electronic recording of two or three other voice parts (sung<br/>by him).</p><p>He obviously puts a lot of work into the performance of his<br/>pieces, and this one came off very well, as did the one he<br/>performed at last year&apos;s AFMM.  Since this one was completely<br/>_a cappella_, it showed off his JI tuning in its most beautiful<br/>and fluid aspect.  His costume and movement added a nice<br/>mystique to the performance.</p><p>The Flux Quartet returned for Adam Silverman&apos;s _Durham_, another<br/>world premiere, and a piece in several movements which was quite<br/>impressive. My only complaint was that most of it (for its<br/>expansive length, too much) was moderate- to slow-paced, with<br/>only one even moderately quick movement.  Altho I thought it was<br/>a very good piece, and an excellent performance, it would have<br/>benefited from at least one really fast movement for contrast.</p><p>Kraig Grady&apos;s beautiful _Farewell Ring_ was played on CD during<br/>the set-up of the next piece, but, as I&apos;ve said, the audience<br/>talked thru it and didn&apos;t allow its beauty to stand unimpeded.</p><p>Skip La Plante and the Homemade Instrument Ensemble gave<br/>two performances.  The first one was a piece with an obvious<br/>pun in the title, called _The Hoary Perch_.  It was OK, sounding<br/>to me very much like the music composed by its &apos;namesake&apos;,<br/>but not as much fun as their second performance.</p><p>Next was a bassoon duet featuring Johnny Reinhard and Yung-Ling<br/>Chang in the world premiere of Johnny&apos;s outrageous _Zanzibar_.</p><p>Any composer who learns in music-school that the bassoon is a<br/>double-reed instrument needs to see this piece.  It&apos;s sort of a<br/>&apos;canon&apos;, but Johnny has the bassoons being treated as not just<br/>double-reed instruments, but also percussion, &apos;brass&apos;, and<br/>didjeridu, thru some playing techniques which are quite different<br/>from those you&apos;ll usually see in the concert hall.</p><p>He played a solo version of this for me last year when I visited<br/>him, and I&apos;ve been calling him the &apos;Hendrix of the Bassoon&apos; ever<br/>since.</p><p>Well, what can one say about Johnny Reinhard&apos;s bassoon technique?<br/>He&apos;s amazing, or maybe even beyond that, for which I can&apos;t<br/>find a suitably descriptive word.  In this piece, he actually<br/>plays *triads by himself on the bassoon*!  And as for Yung-Ling,<br/>she had a velvety tone that I thought even surpassed Johnny&apos;s,<br/>and she caught the spirit of the piece right along with him.</p><p>(I know he had tonsillitis recently, and he had some trouble<br/>keeping the air from escaping thru his lips in one part of the<br/>piece - but he&apos;s still amazing).</p><p>Another mostly-disregarded CD track followed, Ivor Darreg&apos;s<br/>_43/Octave_, a piece in 43-ET which I thought made a nice segue<br/>into the following piece.</p><p>From the Toronto group &apos;Critical Band&apos;, John Gzowski on Partch<br/>replica electric guitar and Garnet Willis on chromelodeon (built<br/>of 2 accordions with bellows), and New York&apos;s Skip LaPlante<br/>on Kithara and Johnny Reinhard on vocals, performed the<br/>second (and seldom heard - I had never heard it before) version<br/>of Harry Partch&apos;s landmark _Barstow_.  Johnny announced, before<br/>they played, that, because of US Customs, Critical Band did not<br/>arrive in time to rehearse, so the piece was done completely<br/>&apos;on the fly&apos;.</p><p>IMO, Johnny provided the best vocal performance of the piece<br/>I&apos;ve ever seen/heard, surpassing even Partch&apos;s own recordings<br/>in its theatrical effectiveness.  The group overall did a<br/>remarkable job considering the lack of rehearsal, only<br/>faltering a tiny bit in the last section (&apos;number 8&apos;).</p><p>I also felt that John Gzowski could have added a bit more<br/>life to his (- other than the numerical announcements of the<br/>sections - ) single commentary &apos;no description found,<br/>so he evidently got his ride&apos;, but Johnny&apos;s performance<br/>*more* than made up for it.  I felt bad for Johnny that<br/>Partch&apos;s voice, and therefore the vocal part, was lower than<br/>his, which made him struggle thru a few really low sections.<br/>But his &apos;attitude&apos; made this a masterful Partch performance,<br/>something that doesn&apos;t come across on recordings alone, which<br/>was part of Partch&apos;s whole point.  IMO, absolutely excellent<br/>and, becuase of Johnny&apos;s stellar performance, the best item on<br/>the whole Microthon.</p><p>Another CD track followed, Warren Burt&apos;s _The White Witch of<br/>the Moon_.</p><p>Jon Gzowski&apos;s piece _Some Small Steps_ (NYC premiere) was for his<br/>unusually-designed 19-eq guitar and violin.  The piece is sort of<br/>Baroque in style, but certainly taking advantage of the<br/>unusual harmonies available in this tuning. The most striking<br/>aspect of his performance was the frequent wobbling of the guitar<br/>to bend the pitch of the entire chords he played thru-out the piece.</p><p>Rebecca van der Post had a gorgeous style on the violin.<br/>In fact while I was in one of the hallways drawing the<br/>posters for my piece during the lunch break I heard her warming<br/>up in one of the other rooms (I recognized her tone when she<br/>performed later) and just playing regular old scales, she got my<br/>attention and it sounded like she was making that fiddle sing.<br/>Absolutely beautiful technique.</p><p>Wim Hoogewerf returned for the third time, again with his<br/>guitar tuned to 24-eq, to perform the NYC premiere of Dick<br/>Vissier&apos;s _Quintierens_.  Wim did a fine job.</p><p>The Homemade Instrument Ensemble returned to play Skip LaPlante&apos;s<br/>_Theme and Variations in 13-Tone Equal Temperament_.  The<br/>performance was obviously under-rehearsed, but in the context of<br/>the whole aesthetic of the Homemade ensemble, that may not have<br/>been too bad.</p><p>As one person near me remarked, it sort of let the audience<br/>in on the whole compositional process.  One variation was<br/>stopped and started over again, then stopped again, and Skip<br/>said &apos;it&apos;s harder than it looks&apos;, and just told the group to<br/>move on to the next one.</p><p>At any rate, whatever its down side, it was fun and (even better)<br/>funny.  My favorite was the variation where each performer played<br/>as fast as possible and stopped at the first mistake (it lasted<br/>about 20 seconds).</p><p>Meredith Borden (singer with Jon Catler&apos;s group &apos;Birdhouse&apos;)<br/>gave a solo performance in the world premiere of her piece<br/>_Icarus Dreams_.  As did Sasha Bogdanowitsch&apos;s performance,<br/>Meredith&apos;s had a beautiful costume, dance movement, and gorgeous<br/>vocals.</p><p>_Icarus Dreams_ had musical accompaniment, played<br/>by Meredith on a JI autoharp.  She showed off her great<br/>sopranino vocal chops and mixed them naturally and beautifully<br/>with a soulful blues feel and motifs, and had remarkably<br/>illustrative silent dance sections interspersed between<br/>each &apos;verse&apos; of the vocals.  One of the most satisfying<br/>performances on the whole show.</p><p>The CD track of Jacques Dudon&apos;s _Musique d&apos;Eau_ ended the<br/>second part of &apos;Microthon&apos;, and the dinner break followed<br/>from 6:00 to 7:00.</p><p>Opening the third part was Elodie Lauten on synthesizer<br/>and vocals and Andrew Bolotowsky (for the third time) in<br/>Elodie&apos;s _XX_.  This was a very atmospheric piece, with most<br/>of the vocals consisting of heavy breathing sounds.  I thought<br/>it was quite strange, relatively static, except for one isolated<br/>scream in the middle, which seemed out of place.  But overall,<br/>a little monotonous, very moody, and mostly pretty cool.<br/>Perhaps a little longer than it needed to be.</p><p>Next, the CD track _Strange Over_ by David First.</p><p>After this came the Patrick Grant Group playing Patrick&apos;s<br/>piece _Everything Distinct: Everything the Same_.  David<br/>Beardsley informed me afterwards that Patrick&apos;s electronic<br/>music is influenced by gamelan.  This is a kind of music<br/>that I don&apos;t particularly follow, so perhaps I&apos;m missing<br/>something, but I thought that it was rather static harmonically<br/>(more than I care for) and felt it would have been better to<br/>have more timbral variety instead of using piano sounds for<br/>all three of the main instruments, but David liked it a lot.</p><p>The CD track of David Rosenboom&apos;s _In the Beginning_ had<br/>an asterisk next to it on the program, indicating a world<br/>premiere, which doesn&apos;t make sense to me since it&apos;s already<br/>been recorded.  In any case, this was marred by its being a<br/>transfer from an LP that had a lot of surface dust and therefore<br/>a lot of &apos;rice krispies&apos; (snap, crackle, and pop).  But no-one<br/>really paid attention anyway.</p><p>The following piece was the world premiere of Carl Lumma&apos;s<br/>_Retrofit_, played by the Regal Brass Quartet.  This is a<br/>JI piece which modulates all the way around a big cycle,<br/>with lots of complex rhythmic counterpoint.  I thought it<br/>was done quite well, but Carl told me after the concert that<br/>it was played about twice as fast as it should have been and<br/>the fugue was not as distinct as it needed to be.</p><p>The next CD track was Bill Sethares&apos;s _Morphine and Cymbals_<br/>from the Tuning Forum CD.</p><p>Paul Erlich performed with Ara Sarkissian on 22-eq electric<br/>guitar and synthesizer.  Paul played the first piece, _TIBIA_,<br/>solo on the synthesizer.  I had heard a recording of this<br/>before, and like the piece very much.  It&apos;s quite simple,<br/>just a melody in the left-hand bass and pulse chords in the<br/>right-hand, but it is very pretty and shows off very well<br/>the pop-style harmonic capabilities of 22-eq.</p><p>Paul seemed quite nervous thru most of his performance, and<br/>in addition, the volume settings of both instruments were too<br/>low, which was too bad, because all their performances would<br/>have come off better with more volume and a little more confidence.  I<br/>enjoyed the old recording of _TIBIA_ more than his performance<br/>here because of this.</p><p>After this piece, Paul took up his 22-eq guitar and Ara played<br/>synthesizer, the next piece being _Rock Thing_, part of which<br/>Paul had played for me when I visited him a few months ago.<br/>I liked it very much then, and again, at the Microthon, altho<br/>the piece was more substantial than what I had heard before,<br/>the performance suffered a bit from a lack of sureness, and,<br/>especially in this piece, a lack of volume.  Ara performed<br/>ably on all three of the pieces that included him.</p><p>The next piece, _Improvisation_, fared a little better, but<br/>seemed mostly to just meander around a few interesting<br/>chord changes.</p><p>Paul&apos;s last piece, _Decatonic Waltz_, was better than the<br/>others, as he seemed to have loosened up a bit by then.</p><p>The world premier of _Seasons_ followed, played by a quartet<br/>consisting of Eric Ross and David Simons on theremins,<br/>Vito Ricco on wrench guitar, and Johnny Reinhard on<br/>electric bassoon.  Johnny announced the piece saying, &apos;it<br/>worked for Vivaldi...&apos;.  Each member of the quartet was<br/>assigned a season, and it came off pretty well, although<br/>IMO there was too much everyone-playing-at-the-same-time.<br/>_Winter_, featuring the wrench guitar, was my favorite section.</p><p>As for my own piece, _A Noiseless Patient Spider_, which<br/>was the final selection on the concert and which was given<br/>with the instrumental tracks on CD and live vocal by myself,<br/>I obviously can&apos;t give an objective opinion or criticism.</p><p>I can say that I am very pleased with it as a piece, was happy<br/>with the performance, and it was received well and I received<br/>many compliments for it after the show.  David Beardsley told<br/>me that the instrumental tracks could have been a little louder.</p><p>I&apos;d like to mention before signing off that Patrick Grant<br/>worked the sound equipment, and I thank him for his assistance<br/>on my soundcheck.  Also, I&apos;d like to thank David Beardsley<br/>for the hours he spent working with me to produce a CD of my<br/>computer files.</p><p>The only other comment I can give is that this was the longest<br/>and most exhausting gig I ever did, but it was certainly an<br/>enjoyable day of microtonal music, and I look forward to<br/>the conclusion of the festival this coming Thursday.</p><p>Joseph L.
