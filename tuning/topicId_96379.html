See &gt; the last half of this message:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/88894">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/88894</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A key sentence in that message is that &quot;there are now 6 major &gt; triads with the major 3rd tempered less than 8 cents&quot; (Bb, F, C, G, &gt; D, and A); 2 others (Eb and E) sound similar to 12-equal, 2 others &gt; (Ab and B) like Pythagorean, and the remaining two (F# and C#) pay &gt; the dues. You may not want to play a piece in the key of F# or C# &gt; major, but OTOH those triads won&apos;t howl at you like they do in Eb-&gt; to-G# meantone. I dare you to put this tuning on a baroque organ &gt; (for testing, a synthetic one will do) and see if it doesn&apos;t knock &gt; your socks off.</p><p>Hahaha ! Hi George, that&apos;s the origin of this famous &quot;temperament extraordinaire&quot; then ? No wonder that I have been searching it in baroque music history in vain !<br/>But very good and explicit name indeed ! So it&apos;s clear now, thanks.<br/>I love them and I have committed in some too !<br/>(not surprising for a &quot;french temperament maker&quot; :-D)<br/>- - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div>
