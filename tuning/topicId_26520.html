I am not trying to deem a set number as adequate,<br/>but simply pointing out a characteristic through which more sub-divisions<br/>of the octave with &quot;keys&quot;  (keys in terms of actual physical keyboard keys)<br/>available to potentially play them will eventually *approach* a *limit* (in the<br/>mathematical sense of limits) where the &quot;keys&quot; played will allow the player<br/>(at least) an *opportunity* to generate such frequencies (which are those<br/>frequencies, or pitches, which are integer multiples of lower pitched &quot;keys&quot;).</p><p>I am not trying to state that any particular ET or EDO of some given number<br/>of subdivisions of the octave is *the* system by which *all* of this works<br/>ideally, or even adequately. It was intended as statement about the trends<br/>that emerge as one compares the implications of smaller (ie 12) scales<br/>relative to larger (ie 72, or what have you), and not as a tuning system<br/>proposal, per se.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t get this: why do you say there is a key for every harmonic on such<br/>&gt;an instrument? Having the fundamental be 1 Hz or 100 kHz doesn&apos;t change<br/>&gt;any of this. Each *low* harmonic of 1 Hz will be represented quite well by<br/>&gt;a degree of the 72-tet scale, but already in the 8th octave there will be<br/>&gt;more than 72 partials to map onto notes, and you won&apos;t have enough.</p><p>Agreed. The general trend I described remains, nevertheless.</p><p>&gt;Similar problem for harmonics of the 72-tet keys: in fact *none* of them,<br/>&gt;except for harmonics of keys a whole number of octaves above 1 Hz, will<br/>&gt;also be harmonics of 1 Hz. Consider the 1st overtone of the 15th key in<br/>&gt;the lowest octave - which harmonic of 1 Hz does this represent? It falls<br/>&gt;between 2 and 3 Hz.</p><p>When you say &quot;1st overtone&quot;, I assume you mean the 2nd harmonic.<br/>When you say &quot;15th key on the keyboard&quot;, if I assume you mean the<br/>key tuned to 15 Hz (cycles per second), with a 2nd harmonic of 30 Hz.</p><p>It seems that, instead of thinking of the keyboard in terms of referencing<br/>to the &quot;1st key&quot; (tuned to 1 Hz) at the leftmost position on the keyboard,<br/>you may well be considering the viewpoint of the reference pitch existing,<br/>instead, somewhere more in the middle of the hypothetical keyboard,<br/>where the harmonic integer multiples of numbers which are *less* than<br/>a value of one certainly DO exist at rational, as opposed to integer, values,<br/>indeed.  Your point is well taken that my perspective is based (in its strictest<br/>sense) on analyzing the multiples of 1 Hz!</p><p>If one considers a tetrachord formed from four &quot;tones&quot; (which each themselves<br/>represent a fundamental frequency as well as equal energy at integer multiples<br/>of those individual fundamental frequencies), this represents a &quot;best-case&quot;<br/>theoretical scenario for the possibility of &quot;common overtones&quot; occuring [which<br/>is probably only *approached* by the frequency spectrums of organ pipes,<br/>and stringed instruments which have been (amplitude) &quot;compressed/limited&quot;<br/>to a large extent (where distortion products at non-harmonically related pitches<br/>will occur due to the non-linear nature of such signal processing techniques)].</p><p>If we set the frequencies of this above described &quot;tetrachord&quot; of &quot;tones&quot;at 1 Hz,<br/>3 Hz, 5 Hz, and 7 Hz, and analyze the number of frequencies between 1 Hz and<br/>45 Hz at which &quot;common overtones&quot; can possibly exist, these frequencies (in Hz) are:</p><p>3  5  6  7  9  10  12  14  15  18  20  21  24  25  27  28  30  33  35  36 39  40  42  45</p><p>which comprise a total of only 24 out of the 44 possible frequencies of where &quot;commonality&quot;<br/>could possibly exist (within the integer-multiple frequencies of 2 Hz to 45 Hz). Overtones<br/>from the 5 Hz &quot;tone&quot; in this &quot;tetrachord&quot; will contribute to the potential number of &quot;common<br/>frequencies&quot; a factor of 3/5 less than the 3 Hz &quot;tone&quot; will, and, similarly, the 7 Hz &quot;tone&quot;<br/>will contribute a factor or 3/7 less than the 3 Hz &quot;tone&quot;, etc., ... in terms of any given unit<br/>of *bandwidth* (or arithmetic ranges of frequency). If the reference pitch is increased,<br/>for instance to 2 Hz instead, and the analysis limit is retained at 45 Hz, potential<br/>&quot;commonality&quot; is further divided by a comensurate amount within that 45 Hz bandwidth.</p><p>My thoughts on a continuum existing between scales which sub-divide the octave by<br/>amounts small and large does (I think) retain merit in the face of the realities above,<br/>since the number of *choices* of possible chords played in a large scale with many<br/>individual choices (accomplished by up to 10 fingers, anyway), and the possibility<br/>of the resultant frequencies present (when considering the &quot;tones&quot; as described above)<br/>being equal to an integer multiple value of *other* frequencies which are also present<br/>is increased (relative to a smaller scale), due to the number of scale intervals from which<br/>a musician may choose.</p><p>&gt;Thanks for explaining this statement -- Jon</p><p>Please let me know if I have succeeded in accomplishing your above request!<br/>I am posting this to the &quot;tuning&quot; group as well as replying to you, and I would be<br/>just as interested in other comments which folks may have regarding this stuff...</p><p>Best Regards,  J Gill</p></div><h3><a id=26521 href="#26521">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2001 10:40:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., J Gill &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>.............</p><p>Hi Gill, using the process of arriving at certain inferences, based<br/>on and around the keyboard as well as the chord formation, we achieve<br/>certain generalizations, starting at 1 Hz.</p><p>Using some such logic, but eliminating the keyboard and the chord,<br/>can we attempt to draw inferences as to how the Rishi-musicologists<br/>would have arrived at the number 22 for microtones?</p><p>With so many pundits on the Tuning list, if we could venture to ....</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=26522 href="#26522">ðŸ”—</a>J Gill &#x3C;JGill99@imajis.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2001 10:58:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., J Gill &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; .............<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Gill, using the process of arriving at certain inferences, based<br/>&gt; on and around the keyboard as well as the chord formation, we<br/>achieve<br/>&gt; certain generalizations, starting at 1 Hz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using some such logic, but eliminating the keyboard and the chord,<br/>&gt; can we attempt to draw inferences as to how the Rishi-musicologists<br/>&gt; would have arrived at the number 22 for microtones?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With so many pundits on the Tuning list, if we could venture to ....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Haresh.</p><p>Haresh,</p><p>Could you clarify what you intended to mean by your statement:<br/>&quot;eliminating the keyboard and the chord&quot; in your post?</p><p>Also, your message ends &quot;if we could venture to ...&quot; and ...?</p></div><h3><a id=26527 href="#26527">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2001 4:33:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;J Gill&quot; &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p>....................</p><p>Hi Gill, by &quot;elimination of the keyboard and chords&quot; I meant that,<br/>since there is no keyboard, and there are no chords in Indian music,<br/>our inferences will have to be drawn for the number 22 (microtones =<br/>shruti-s), so that the concepts of the keyboard and the chords are<br/>not involved at any stage of reasoning.
