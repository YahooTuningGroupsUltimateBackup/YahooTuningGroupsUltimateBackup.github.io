(OK so this<br/>might be on &quot;metatuning&quot; but who wants to go over there...? :)</p><p>Winter 2002-2003<br/>SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT</p><p>Dear Supporters of CRI:</p><p>As many of you may have heard already, CRI, along with many small,<br/>independent record labels, has been experiencing extreme financial<br/>hardship over the past two years.</p><p>The Board of Directors of CRI has been working tirelessly over the<br/>past seven months to explore ways by which we might be able to keep<br/>our doors open. However, given the current funding climate and global<br/>market, this has proved to be an impossible task, much to our<br/>sadness. The Board currently is finalizing arrangements with another<br/>well-respected and established not-for-profit recording label. This<br/>label has been most generous in their offer to ensure the<br/>preservation of CRI&apos;s archives. They will continue to ensure that all<br/>titles remain in print via various new media that have become<br/>available over the past few years.</p><p>As far as accepting new submissions and the releasing of new titles,<br/>CRI will cease to exist as we have all known it. The Board and<br/>Executive Director will be happy to assist composers by suggesting<br/>alternative labels that may be approached.</p><p>It has always been the resolve of the Board to ensure that the<br/>archives remain available while being preserved for future<br/>generations. This arrangement will allow this to become a reality. We<br/>expect to release full details after the first of the year.</p><p>To all of you who have supported CRI in the past, please accept our<br/>heartfelt thanks and appreciation.</p><p>All best wishes,</p><p>John G. Schultz<br/>Executive Director</p><p>Composers Recordings, Inc.<br/>73 Spring Street, Suite 505<br/>New York, NY 10012-5802</p><p>***Yes, indeed, it is a sad state of affairs.  However, composers on<br/>this list, who don&apos;t already know it, should be appraised of the fact<br/>that composers *themselves* were expected to raise the funds for<br/>their *own* recordings.  CRI didn&apos;t lift a finger in this.  (Not the<br/>*right* finger, anyway...)</p><p>This is common practice, though, for many smaller labels, and to my<br/>knowledge the *only* fund that is available for composers doing<br/>recordings presently is the Copland Fund... (Cary Trust and Jerome<br/>stopped them within the last couple of years, I believe...)</p><p>J.
