At least not in general. I think you are referring to the time<br/>you proposed rounding 12-tET notes to the nearest 10-tET note. I suspect<br/>you would only have to listen to the result applied to some familiar piece<br/>to know why I thought this a very odd suggestion.</p><p>The idea of mapping from 12-tET to certain other &quot;compatible&quot; ETs with<br/>_more_ than 12 notes is not at all odd. I have attempted 12 to 31 myself<br/>with the aim of improving 5-limit consonances. But it is considerably more<br/>complicated than merely rounding to the nearest note. You can read an<br/>introduction to the method at:<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/AdaptiveMeantone.htm">http://dkeenan.com/Music/AdaptiveMeantone.htm</a></p><p>As far as going to fewer notes, maybe rounding from 12-tET to 7-tET could<br/>result in some pieces still being recognisable. You have the problem of<br/>deciding which 12-tET note (if any) should align exactly with a 7-tET note,<br/>as you will get different roundings with different choices. But what&apos;s the<br/>point? I don&apos;t think anyone is likely to consider it an improvement.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=14555 href="#14555">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2000 7:53:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, David C Keenan &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; As far as going to fewer notes, maybe rounding from 12-tET to 7-tET<br/>could<br/>&gt; result in some pieces still being recognisable.

Also<br/>possible are exploring new colors and new way of expressing<br/>structural relationships.</p><p>One of my first experiences with a wide variety of alternative<br/>tunings was in college with<br/>the BASIC (was it QBASIC?) on the Mac and a built-in demo program<br/>which translated a<br/>&quot;score&quot; file (with traditional-style notation using letter names,<br/>sharps and flats) -- and<br/>the built-in score file was a well-known Bach piece. Fortunately, the<br/>program was easily<br/>modified to change the sizes of whole tones (a-b, c-d, d-e, f-g,<br/>g-a), diatonic semitones<br/>(e-f and b-c), and chromatic semitones (sharps and flats). By setting<br/>whole tones and<br/>diatonic semitones to 1/7 octave and chromatic semitones to 0, a<br/>7-tET rendition was<br/>obtained -- Thai Bach! Rounding to 7-tET wouldn&apos;t have acheived this<br/>effect, as some<br/>keys would have been mutated into scales of fewer than 7 tones; but<br/>this Mac BASIC<br/>approach always treated seven letter names as seven distinct pitches.<br/>Sure, all the logic<br/>of the modulations disappeared, and the piece was rather monotonous,<br/>but it was a<br/>great way to experience 7-tET and the properties it has when used as<br/>a diatonic scale<br/>(neutral triads, equal steps, . . .).</p><p>Similarly, setting whole tones to 5/31 octave,  diatonic semitones to<br/>3/31 octave, and<br/>chromatic semitones to 2/31 octave resulted in a wonderful meantone<br/>rendition of the<br/>Bach that is quite historically appropriate, and no doubt identical<br/>to what Dave Keenan&apos;s<br/>approach would have yielded. An improvement in terms of the<br/>smoothness of the 5-limit<br/>consonances, yes. But my violinist roommate didn&apos;t like it because<br/>there was no &quot;noise&quot;<br/>(probably a reference to the roughness among the difference tones of<br/>the 12-tET chords)<br/>which he found comfortable. So, although I would hope to convince him<br/>otherwise, at<br/>least at that moment this was not, for him, an &quot;improvement&quot;.</p><p>I played with many other tunings including pelog-like ones where the<br/>whole tones were<br/>smaller than the semitones, as well as tunings where the semitones<br/>were negative!<br/>Although some of the results were bizarre, some element of the logic<br/>of Bach&apos;s music<br/>always came through, and this was due to a consistent mapping of the<br/>diatonic intervals,<br/>which would not have resulted from a simple rounding operation.</p></div>
