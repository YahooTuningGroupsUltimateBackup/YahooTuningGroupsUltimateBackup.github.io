Instead of there being a dissonant tritone, there&apos;s a<br/>dissonant augmented fifth. The &quot;anti-Ionian&quot; mode contains minor i,<br/>iv, and v triads, and the &quot;anti-Aeolian&quot; mode contains major I, IV,<br/>and V triads. This might be review for most of you.</p><p>What is really interesting about Mavila is that all of the comma pumps<br/>in Meantone also work if you turn every major chord into a minor chord<br/>and vice versa.</p><p>For example (using Meantone notation for all just to avoid having to<br/>define a new notation)</p><p>Meantone: Cmaj -&gt; Am -&gt; Dm -&gt; Gmaj -&gt; Cmaj (Ionian)<br/>Mavila: Cm -&gt; Abmaj -&gt; Dbmaj -&gt; Gmaj (same as Gb) -&gt; Cmaj<br/>(Anti-Ionian*) - the Dbmaj -&gt; Gmaj is motion by 4/3</p><p>Meantone: Cm -&gt; Gm -&gt; Dm -&gt; Fmaj -&gt; Cm (Dorian)<br/>Mavila: Cmaj -&gt; Gmaj -&gt; Dmaj -&gt; Fm (same as F#m) -&gt; Cm (Anti-Dorian) -<br/>the F#-A from the Dmaj becomes equal to the F-Ab in Fm</p><p>Meantone: Cm -&gt; Ebmaj -&gt; Bbmaj -&gt; Fm -&gt; Cm (Aeolian)<br/>Mavila: Cmaj -&gt; Em -&gt; Bm -&gt; Fmaj (same as F#) -&gt; Cmaj (Anti-Aeolian) -<br/>the Bm -&gt; Fmaj is motion by 4/3</p><p>Meantone: Cm -&gt; Ebmaj -&gt; Bbm -&gt; Fm -&gt; Cm (Phrygian)<br/>Mavila: Cmaj -&gt; Em -&gt; Bmaj -&gt; Fmaj (same as F#) -&gt; Cmaj<br/>(Anti-Phrygian) - the Bmaj -&gt; Fmaj motion is by 4/3 (whooooo yeah!!!!)</p><p>You get the picture - so all of existing common practice music should<br/>be able to be translated into this &quot;alternate universe&quot; and comma<br/>pumps should still work. Furthermore, the pattern of steps should<br/>remain the same, and there should still be a dissonant interval in the<br/>right place, except now it&apos;s an augmented fifth rather than a<br/>diminished fifth.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>*The &quot;anti-&quot; prefix means that the pattern of steps are identical to<br/>the meantone counterpart, e.g. anti-Ionian is ssLsssL, identical to<br/>Ionian&apos;s LLsLLLs.</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2011 6:28:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry, it looks like the last paragraph didn&apos;t get sent through properly -</p><p>So where I need advice is - I predict that using a mavila tuning with<br/>a fifth flatter than POTE optimal will yield better results than the<br/>optimal one, since with the optimal mavila fifth, the augmented fifth<br/>will be about 721.166 cents, which I don&apos;t think will be dissonant<br/>enough at all. I wanted to try exploring 16-equal, perhaps 25b-equal,<br/>and maybe even 9-equal. So I need to find a way to make a generalized<br/>mavila &quot;score&quot; and then pick a specific tuning. Can anyone recommend<br/>an efficient way to do this? Might using Lilypond be good for this<br/>purpose?</p><p>Lastly, I need a piece to try out. Something with lots of comma pumps<br/>that is still clearly tonal would be nice. Any suggestions? :)</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Thu, May 19, 2011 at 9:20 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mavila is an interesting tuning system in that mavila[7] contains the<br/>&gt; same step patterns as meantone[7], but the pattern of whole steps is<br/>&gt; flipped.
