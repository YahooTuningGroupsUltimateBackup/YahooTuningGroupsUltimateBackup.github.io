Probably it will have to be<br/>cut some...</p><p>In any case, comments and criticisms are encouraged, since this is<br/>still a working draft.</p><p>MicroFest 2001, organized by Bill Alves of Harvey Mudd College took<br/>place in Claremont, California, a college town near Los Angeles on<br/>April 6-8, 2001.  The event was a bit reminiscent of Johnny<br/>Reinhard&apos;s similarly named New York MicroFest of 1988 in that it<br/>combined a series of concerts with lectures on alternate tunings.<br/>All in all, the Claremont MicroFest was an exciting celebration of<br/>music and thinking &quot;outside the box&quot; as it were, of 12-tone equal<br/>temperament, our &quot;standard&quot; system.</p><p>Among the special guests were Lou Harrison, who needs little<br/>introduction as one of our preeminent American composers and Erv<br/>Wilson, an innovative creator of alternate tuning systems.  The final<br/>concert of the event, in fact, was entirely devoted to the works of<br/>Lou Harrison and spanned his entire career including, in fact, one<br/>early piece that was in 12-tone equal temperament.  Actually, it was<br/>quite a good piece, a work for organ that showed Harrison&apos;s early<br/>chromatic style that was, quite frankly, more related to Carl Ruggles<br/>than to Arnold Schoenberg.  Throughout ALL of Harrison&apos;s music there<br/>is one constant -- expressivity.  Most of his works have a soaring<br/>melodic line which in the later works, of course, is in an alternate<br/>tuning.  Additionally, there was some research done (Harrison called<br/>it &quot;mining&quot; at the event) on some of his very early pieces, one The<br/>Geography of Heaven composed in High School!  In this piece, Harrison<br/>was already using quartertones to approximate the harmonic series,<br/>having learned about microtonality through study of Henry Cowell,<br/>Julian Carrillo and Alois Haba scores.</p><p>In the realm of entertaining MicroFest lectures, Erv Wilson stands in<br/>the forefront.  I was quite prepared for the Erv Wilson lecture,<br/>since I have studied some of his systems and understand they are<br/>quite complex.  I had reams of paper for note taking and a scientific<br/>calculator handy.  I took a deep breath and waited for the onslaught<br/>of complex mathematics and systematic tuning theories.  None such<br/>happened.  Instead, there appeared a rather jovial man with many<br/>entirely entertaining molecular models of tuning systems.  These<br/>models (called Zometools) are borrowed from chemistry, and pitches<br/>are represented three dimensionally with these plastic models which<br/>can be assembled like &quot;Lego&quot; toys.  Plastic vertices are stuck<br/>together with each point (called a &quot;Zome ball&quot;) representing a pitch.<br/> Some of Wilson&apos;s models are very large, let&apos;s say a couple feet in<br/>diameter, and incredibly complex.  The larger ones also &quot;evolve&quot; from<br/>duplication of some of the smaller components.  In a handout, Wilson<br/>illustrated some of the complex pitch relationships.  However, he had<br/>intentionally designed the lecture to be entertaining even to a<br/>novice, and the beautiful lattices were shown with a gently pulsating<br/>soundtrack in the background.  Wilson took us to a different world of<br/>exploration and creativity and managed to convey the excitement he<br/>feels with such discoveries.  This communication was every bit as<br/>important as the specifics, which we can all learn in time.</p><p>In addition to the lectures and the concerts, there was an<br/>&quot;Electronic Music Listening Room&quot; which went on during the course of<br/>theFestival. There were three programs, two audio (the present author<br/>of this article had two pieces on these programs) and one video.<br/>This included the Madeline Tourtelot film, The Music Studio, which<br/>showed Harry Partch illustrating and playing many of his new<br/>instruments. As mentioned by composer Warren Burt at the event, this<br/>film belies the statement that Partch was a &quot;technophobe&quot; since he<br/>used multi-track recording technology to create a &quot;one man band&quot; in<br/>his recordings of that time.</p><p>As is the case with many conferences of this nature, it was<br/>impossible to see and hear everything, since there were events<br/>occurring simultaneously.  Therefore, I missed some crucial lectures,<br/>mostly during the time I spent in the Electronic Listening Room.<br/>However, a couple of lectures stand out: an excellent lecture by<br/>David Doty illustrating his compositional techniques in just<br/>intonation,and a demonstration by Australian composer Greg Schiemer.<br/>Doty used a laser pointer and projected transparencies to show his<br/>use<br/>of &quot;comma shifts&quot; in his music as a melodic element.  He pointed to<br/>the pitches he used in his pieces by referring to a projected lattice<br/>and pointing out the pitches as they were played on a CD.  This was a<br/>VERY clear and graphic presentation.  Greg Schiemer is involved in<br/>exceptionally accelerated music thinking, working with the Erv Wilson<br/>&quot;hexany&quot; system and even creating battery-powered portable<br/>instruments<br/>that can be controlled and programmed with cell-phone technology!<br/>Schiemer is clearly on the forefront of new music thinking.</p><p>The second concert of the Festival (I did not arrive in time for the<br/>first) was a retrospective of the works of Harry Partch.  There were<br/>some magnificent performances on this concert, which was organized<br/>and directed by virtuoso Partch interpreter and guitarist, John<br/>Schneider. Schneider has perfected some of his Partch performances to<br/>what might be termed an &quot;historical&quot; level.  His performance of the<br/>Partch Barstow:  Eight Hitchhiker&apos;s Inscriptions (1941) which was<br/>performed three years ago on Johnny Reinhard&apos;s AFMM concerts, is now<br/>at an incredible level of perfection.  Using an adapted guitar in a<br/>29-tone system, Schneider delivers a musical and technically polished<br/>performance.  It&apos;s even ambulatory, as he enters and moves around the<br/>auditorium!  A curiosity was an early Partch song in 12-equal<br/>temperament.  Generally speaking, Partch managed to destroy all his<br/>early works in conventional temperament.  This piece, however, My<br/>Heart Keeps Beating Time, managed to escape destruction, since it was<br/>an early publication.   I agree with microtonal expert Joe Monzo,<br/>that this is really quite a fine song.  Perhaps it can lead some<br/>credence to the fact that an interesting composer is just that,<br/>regardless of any tuning system.  But, of course, alternate tunings<br/>are an integral part of the later Partch.</p><p>Concert III on Saturday afternoon contained a couple of highlights,<br/>Kraig Grady&apos;s Opening Invocation for a Shadow Play and an electronic<br/>work by Shahrokh Yadegari.  Grady&apos;s piece plays upon beats created by<br/>xylophone tones close in pitch.  He uses a small xylophone that he<br/>has retuned in one of his original tuning systems.  (Most modeled<br/>after theories of Erv Wilson).  This beating is used very effectively<br/>as an integral element in the composition and there is always a sense<br/>that Grady is quite an accomplished composer.  Likewise, Shahrokh<br/>Yadegari&apos;s electonic piece was masterful, using quadraphonic<br/>electronic techniques perfected in his studies at IRCAM in Paris.  In<br/>addition, he is interested in incorporating aspects of Persian music<br/>in his efforts, and the mix is quite original.</p><p>Highlights of Saturday night&apos;s concert, Concert IV, included a piece<br/>by composer/mathematician David Canright and Kyle Gann&apos;s recent<br/>masterwork, Custer and Sitting Bull.  The Canright piece used rhythms<br/>derived from the Fibonacci series (remember, 1,1, 2,3,5,8,13, 21Â…<br/>each subsequent number the sum of the two previous) and the resulting<br/>work for piano SEVEN hands produced an audible variety resulting from<br/>his sophisticated rhythms.  Four guys sitting on a piano bench in<br/>this piece might look a little hokey, but it was mostly just a bit<br/>comical and the result was well worth it.  Because of the rhythmic<br/>complexities inherent in this work, Canright conducted in front of<br/>the piano.  Kyle Gann, noted composer and music critic, has been<br/>presenting his &quot;Custer piece&quot; everyplace -- 18 times so far by his<br/>count.  Essentially, it is a theatre work and Gann plays the part of<br/>BOTH Custer and Sitting Bull, the two opposing &quot;male egos&quot; in the<br/>clash between the American Indian culture and the white man.  There<br/>is some great opportunity for &quot;white male humiliation&quot; in this piece<br/>and, understandably, the piece has been quite popular, considering<br/>the Zeitgeist.  The work, delivered and entirely memorized by Gann is<br/>about an hour in length, and takes us on a tour of several different<br/>tunings:  a scale of 20 pitches in one part, 22-to-the-octave in<br/>another section, and 30 in yet another.  It&apos;s a real &quot;tour de force.&quot;<br/>Since the MicroFest was an event-filled long weekend, there was,<br/>obviously, much more music and discussion of value than can be<br/>described here.  The overall format, however, of BOTH seminars AND<br/>concerts, pioneered by Johnny Reinhard in the original New York<br/>MicroFest and continued in Bill Alves&apos; recent California one, seems<br/>fruitful.  There is nothing like presenting theories IN ACTION in<br/>real music, and the Claremont MicroFest fulfilled the aims of<br/>describing new ways of composing, thinking about music and presenting<br/>actual musical results!</p><p>JOSEPH PEHRSON</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>4/11/2001 11:54:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph,</p><p>Sorry that we didn&apos;t cross paths, as I left after the Partch concert<br/>due to previous commitments.

Actually, it was quite a good piece, a work for<br/>&gt; organ ...</p><p>I&apos;ll come back to this, but you seem to mention 12tet pieces a couple<br/>of times, saying that they are &apos;quite good&apos; -- but isn&apos;t the point of<br/>a festival to focus on other stuff (which I acknowledge you cover at<br/>length)? There are so many places people can read about 12tet, why<br/>here. Unless your audience couldn&apos;t possibly stand to be without it<br/>for too long... :)</p><p>&gt; This included the Madeline Tourtelot film, The Music Studio, which<br/>&gt; showed Harry Partch illustrating and playing many of his new<br/>&gt; instruments.</p><p>Tiniest of nits to pick: the film is titled &quot;Music Studio -- Harry<br/>Partch&quot;.</p><p>&gt; As mentioned by composer Warren Burt at the event, this<br/>&gt; film belies the statement that Partch was a &quot;technophobe&quot;<br/>&gt; since he used multi-track recording technology to create a<br/>&gt; &quot;one man band&quot; in his recordings of that time.</p><p>I disagree that many would think Partch a &quot;technophobe&quot;. Most learned<br/>readers know that Partch was involved in recordings very early on,<br/>that he was a hands-on person in virtually every aspect of<br/>his &apos;career&apos;, including learning the use of tools, recording<br/>equipment, and the like. From the acetate recordings of the 1940&apos;s<br/>through sitting with him in a multi-track studio in 1971, he was<br/>always keen to at least *understand* the technology.</p><p>And then go out and perform live!</p><p>Also, the &quot;one-man band&quot; is misleading: while that may have been the<br/>effect, especially in Tourtelot&apos;s somewhat camped-up film, it was<br/>more economic -- at this point he had no ensemble, wanted to create<br/>the film score to &quot;Windsong&quot;, and ended up finding a way to record<br/>all the parts himself.</p><p>&gt; Greg Schiemer is involved in exceptionally accelerated music<br/>&gt; thinking, working with the Erv Wilson &quot;hexany&quot; system and even<br/>&gt; creating battery-powered portable instruments that can be<br/>&gt; controlled and programmed with cell-phone technology!<br/>&gt; Schiemer is clearly on the forefront of new music thinking.</p><p>Somebody: ask Greg to post his current activities here!</p><p>About John Schneider&apos;s Partch concert:</p><p>&gt; His performance of the<br/>&gt; Partch Barstow:  Eight Hitchhiker&apos;s Inscriptions (1941) which was<br/>&gt; performed three years ago on Johnny Reinhard&apos;s AFMM concerts, is<br/>&gt; now at an incredible level of perfection.  Using an adapted<br/>&gt; guitar in a 29-tone system, Schneider delivers a musical and<br/>&gt; technically polished performance.</p><p>Except that he will have to work on projection, as in all the vocal<br/>works, since he happens to have a light and mellow timbre to his<br/>voice; we have spoken about this, but I know that in the back of the<br/>room some of the lyrics, especially in other pieces, were difficult<br/>to catch.</p><p>Also, Schneider has performed it elsewhere on numerous occasions --<br/>even if the article is only for New Yorkers, 3 mentions of Johnny<br/>Reinhard and his amazing MicroFest (was he in attendance at<br/>Claremont) seems a bit heavy on the plugging.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s even ambulatory, as he enters and moves around the<br/>&gt; auditorium!</p><p>Duh! Wouldn&apos;t one hope for this in a Partch performance? Yes, this is<br/>just the *first* step on the road to a truly corporeal rendition. In<br/>May things will go even farther, I predict...</p><p>&gt; A curiosity was an early Partch song in 12-equal<br/>&gt; temperament.  Generally speaking, Partch managed to destroy all his<br/>&gt; early works in conventional temperament.  This piece, however, My<br/>&gt; Heart Keeps Beating Time, managed to escape destruction, since it<br/>&gt; was an early publication.</p><p>Written and published under the name &quot;Paul Pirate&quot;.</p><p>&gt; I agree with microtonal expert Joe Monzo, that this is really quite<br/>&gt; a fine song.  Perhaps it can lead some credence to the fact that an<br/>&gt; interesting composer is just that, regardless of any tuning<br/>&gt; system.</p><p>If true, wouldn&apos;t it also mean that a weak composer will be a weak<br/>composer, no many how many different styles or intonations they try<br/>their hand at? Perhaps it just means that a person who accompanied<br/>silent films for years and heard many recordings and radio broadcasts<br/>of popular forms could work likewise.</p><p>In any event, it&apos;s up to you if you choose to spend half of the<br/>Partch section on a 12tet piece (which is why I&apos;m not fond of the<br/>overly long inclusion on the concert from &quot;Bitter Music&quot;), and that<br/>is your call. On the other hand, there was a lot of fine Partchian JI<br/>music, including pieces with Schneider&apos;s brand new diamond marimba,<br/>which is not just a collection of cardboard tubes, but a very, very<br/>finely crafted instrumental creation.</p><p>&gt; Grady&apos;s piece plays upon beats created by xylophone tones close in<br/>&gt; pitch.  He uses a small xylophone that he has retuned in one of<br/>&gt; his original tuning systems.</p><p>Again, just a question of accuracy: I wasn&apos;t there, but in previous<br/>performances I have seen Kraig using metallophones, and when you<br/>mention the beating I have to think that xylophones, which are wooden-<br/>barred with short duration, is not what he was using, but instruments<br/>(with bars similar to vibraphones and glockenspiels) of metal bars.</p><p>Looks like you had a great time, Joe, and it is good that you are<br/>spreading the word along. Bill Alves done good on this one.</p><p>I don&apos;t know the format of the article, but if you need photos, I<br/>took a few on Friday, in digital format, and could send them to you<br/>(including &quot;microtonal expert Joe Monzo&quot;). And David Doty was taking<br/>a lot of photos as well. How do I know? HEY DAVID!

The<br/>original recording made by Partch used a bass drum instead (and the Bass<br/>Marimba was added much later).  I played them and vocalized &quot;corporeally&quot; and<br/>repeated slights are anal at best.  A tubed-diamond marimba could not work<br/>(so don&apos;t fear all holders of original Partch instruments).  However, Skip<br/>LaPLante spent over a year constructing a wonderful &quot;traveling&quot; Kithara.  It<br/>takes 2 full days to build and a single day to dissemble.  The materials cost<br/>$1000 and it was built to Partch&apos;s specifications.  It&apos;s time for Jon to<br/>increase his seretonin levels and to stop disparaging others, even it has<br/>been traditional for him to so.</p><p>Respectfully, and wishin&apos; I could have been there, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>4/12/2001 6:36:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JSZANTO@A... wrote:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20944">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/20944</a></p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll come back to this, but you seem to mention 12tet pieces a<br/>couple of times, saying that they are &apos;quite good&apos; --</p><p>Mmmm, mmmm, good!

I personally know of *zero* &quot;Partch<br/>ensemblers&quot; that have ever, or *would* ever, cast a doubt on Partch&apos;s<br/>non-percussion compositions. While all composers have strong and weak<br/>moments in their entire output, there is no dividing line between the<br/>early works and later works in terms of intrinsic quality. If you<br/>*ever* make such claims, you better be prepared to back up such loose<br/>statements with fact.</p><p>&quot;Bitter Music&quot; was, in Partch&apos;s intentions, destroyed. What he didn&apos;t<br/>realize was that Lauriston Marshall had kept a copy and microfilmed<br/>it, which is why we have it today. It is a valid and important<br/>chronicle of part of HPs life and arc. When and if it is performed,<br/>it should be seen in that light. However, including it as the bulk of<br/>a program, with a singer sitting at a grand piano, certainly distorts<br/>the stated path of this particular composer. It should not be<br/>censored, but anyone with good taste and care for a composer&apos;s<br/>aesthetics would use all consideration in it&apos;s programming.</p><p>&gt; Re Jon Szanto, don&apos;t knock AFMM usage of  the tubed marimba in your<br/>&gt; responses (it was an exceptionally valuable musical resource for<br/>&gt; Dark Brother).</p><p>I will, I have, and there are justifiable reasons. See below.</p><p>&gt; The original recording made by Partch used a bass drum instead (and<br/>&gt; the Bass Marimba was added much later).  I played them and<br/>&gt; vocalized &quot;corporeally&quot; and  repeated slights are anal at best.</p><p>I do think that is my first mention of it. I bring it up because a<br/>couple of people have written me in the intervening days, having seen<br/>the Barb performance, and found it ludicrous.</p><p>&gt; A tubed-diamond marimba could not work<br/>&gt; (so don&apos;t fear all holders of original Partch instruments).<br/>&gt; However, Skip LaPLante spent over a year constructing a<br/>&gt; wonderful &quot;traveling&quot; Kithara.  It takes 2 full days to build and a<br/>&gt; single day to dissemble.  The materials cost $1000 and it was built<br/>&gt; to Partch&apos;s specifications.</p><p>Long ago I wrote you, Johnny, after careful listening to your<br/>performance of &quot;U. S. Highball&quot;, including commentary on the usage of<br/>the Kithara. In a number of places I was sure that it was an octave<br/>off, and that was among a number of other problems. You never replied<br/>back, so you don&apos;t want to own up to any problems that might crop up.</p><p>But about the instruments in general, I find Skip LaPlante speaks<br/>well enough himself:</p><p>From &quot;Mailing Tube Drums and Styrocellos: Two Really Simple<br/>Instruments&quot;</p><p>&quot;Over the years members of the group Music for Homemade Instruments<br/>have created a huge collection of instruments from trash, most of<br/>which are notable for sounding good, looking hideous, and using<br/>readily available materials in a very basic way.&quot;</p><p>Jon: Looking hideous. Well, there is someone in tune with Partch&apos;s<br/>stated goal of &quot;visual beauty&quot;.</p><p>================</p><p>&quot;As I got into making instruments Partch became sort of a beacon. I<br/>was most interested in his incredible collection of timbres, a bit<br/>overwhelmed by the tuning theory and not very interested in<br/>corporeality.&quot;</p><p>Jon: Yes, HP encountered many people with similar tastes during his<br/>life. This quote sounds amazingly like Partch&apos;s stories of the<br/>Hollywood film composers, who wanted his instruments just for the<br/>quirky sounds and nothing else.</p><p>================</p><p>&quot;I built a copy of Harry Partch&apos;s New Kithara in 1988 as a project<br/>for a residency at Newark Community School for the Arts. Suddenly I<br/>became indespensible as the instrument builder for the American<br/>Festival of Microtonal Music. I&apos;m the guy who gets to go build some<br/>weird instrument that we can&apos;t get but is critical to play some piece<br/>Johnny Reinhard wants to try, then I learn how to play the instrument<br/>and perform with it. Some job description.&quot;</p><p>Jon: Some attitude. Look, someone could make a great instrument, to<br/>specs, completely unaware of it&apos;s eventual use. But these statements<br/>seem to reinforce the impressions that a number of people have<br/>gathered from this performance.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s time for Jon to increase his seretonin levels and to stop<br/>&gt; disparaging others, even it has  been traditional for him to so.</p><p>I have a lot of my life invested in one particular musical avenue,<br/>which is clear to all. When I hear, at concerts I haven&apos;t been able<br/>to attend, that performers are taking a liberties in aesthetics and<br/>performance standards that go beyond the pale, I won&apos;t look the other<br/>way. I frankly look at Partch as much more than a way to make a name<br/>for oneself, which others do.</p><p>I&apos;ve also roundly applauded the efforts of those that make the<br/>microtonal scene happen in a musically valid way, so you are just<br/>ignoring the recent posts that are lauditory. Unending &quot;pat on the<br/>back&quot; homilies may make some in a small community (which MicroFest<br/>surely attests to it&apos;s still smallness), it doesn&apos;t address larger<br/>issues.</p><p>If one cares, one speaks.</p><p>Respectfully,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Bill Alves &#x3C;ALVES@ORION.AC.HMC.EDU&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2001 9:42:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;However, DOES ANYBODY KNOW who constructed the new diamond marimba<br/>&gt;for John Schneider...??
