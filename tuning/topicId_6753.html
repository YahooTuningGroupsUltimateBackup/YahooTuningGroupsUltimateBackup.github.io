Actually, my picture was<br/>more like &quot;simulated annealling&quot;, with forces in Western<br/>music coalescing into a &quot;local minima&quot;, ease of playing,<br/>transposing, instrument building, and a match with certain<br/>musics of the times.</p><p>John Link, you&apos;ve posted some interesting things lately<br/>and the Bernstein quote may have got me going on a book<br/>purchase for the holidays. Sometime I really hope to hear<br/>your various musics.</p><p>Regarding announcements of non-microtone performances, I<br/>will not be posting anything about my jazz performances in<br/>Israel, which would be 12tet if we were in-tune and I<br/>didn&apos;t get string-bending fever...</p><p>A quick Ives question. I<br/>am looking for a quote of his regarding a piece which<br/>&quot;mixes&quot; in an Ivesian manner a variety of hymns which he<br/>described as including the &quot;ghosts in the church&quot;. [My<br/>interest in his statement is referring to the use of<br/>quoted material in jazz solo&apos;s. Some do it as a joke,<br/>but others are finding the &apos;ghosts&apos; in the music.]</p><p>Regarding &apos;interpretations&apos; of older music which are<br/>tuning based, I agree with a bunch of points. Music<br/>notation is a very inexact medium for communicating an<br/>imagined sound. You can try to approximate what the<br/>compser may have thought was a reasonable performance<br/>by playing period instruments, tuning, styles, probably<br/>period dress and foods if we are talking a performance<br/>rather than just a sonic rendering... Or you can try to<br/>find what &apos;speaks&apos; in the music and bring that out. We<br/>call this interpretation, and there have been some fairly<br/>radical interpretations which have become accepted because<br/>of the integrity of both the speach of the music and the<br/>speach of the interpreter (Segovia moving solo cello<br/>and violin works to the guitar was considered fairly<br/>radical, Glenn Goulds Bach on piano would have been<br/>radical on ANY instrument the way he milks some of the<br/>passing dissonances. I find both of these artists to<br/>have come up with beautiful music, more than the some<br/>of Bach+Segovia, etc).</p><p>So I believe Ehrichs (and others) comments about some<br/>retuning experiments may be on the mark. The speech<br/>of the interpretation MAY be &quot;inharmonious&quot; with the<br/>speech of the composition (to some ears). This is<br/>refered to as a &quot;bad interpretation&quot;.</p><p>But I think this approach CAN (like transposing and<br/>re-orchstrating) lead to GOOD interpretations, whether<br/>or not imagined by the composer.</p><p>And it sounds<br/>like a great learning experience, so I won&apos;t begrudge<br/>anyone for this activity.  Referring to the &quot;local<br/>minima&quot; statement at the<br/>beginning of this letter, I think original compositions<br/>are what will lead to new &quot;local minima&quot;, but the<br/>path may be pointed out by any manner of experiment.</p><p>Happy Holidays folks,</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
