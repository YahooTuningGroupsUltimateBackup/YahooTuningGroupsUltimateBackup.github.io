Also, in 1618, Fabio Colonna published<br/>a treatise about a similar instrument with a circulating 31-note meantone<br/>temperament, including an example of a piece moving through cadences on<br/>all 31 steps of the instrument.</p><p>The interval of a meantone diesis (128:125) -- or the very similar<br/>1/31-octave in 31-tet -- can be very expressive both melodically and in<br/>yielding certain altered vertical intervals. This might be called a<br/>&quot;fifthtone,&quot; and Vicentino uses it in some of his compositions<br/>(unfortunately, only a few sample sections of madrigals using this style<br/>and one complete Latin motet honoring a patron have come down to us).</p><p>Really we might describe 31-tet as just a mathematically symmetrical<br/>version of circulating 31-note 1/4-comma meantone. In the latter tuning,<br/>we need to make the last odd fifth of the cycle about 6.07 cents wider<br/>than the others in order to arrive at a cycle of an even 18 octaves --<br/>interestingly making this last fifth almost pure, since the others are<br/>narrowed by 1/4 syntonic comma (~5.38 cents).</p><p>While my articles of last year cover mainly Renaissance/Manneristic<br/>music and derivative styles, people like Paul Erlich and Dave Keenan are<br/>more familiar with some of the many other uses of 31-tet (or its close<br/>meantone relative), and the Huygens-Fokker site is a great place to begin<br/>also.</p><p>Incidentally, since Paul has mentioned adaptive tuning, I should mention<br/>that both he and Vicentino have apparently independently come up with<br/>schemes for just intonation of all 5-limit vertical intervals (the<br/>standard concords of Renaissance music) using 1/4-comma meantone as a base<br/>gamut, but making modifications where required. One theory is that this is<br/>what singers and players of non-fixed-pitch instruments may do in<br/>practice.</p><p>One historical note: while 1/4-comma meantone and 31-tet are<br/>mathematically distinct, and some people have reported being able to<br/>distinguish the two tunings, there&apos;s not necessarily a clear distinction<br/>in the Renaissance. Thus Vicentino figures his intervals in terms of<br/>fifths of a tone, and do I very often using 1/4-comma meantone, although<br/>as it turns out these five parts of the tone are slightly unequal -- just<br/>as this planet is not quite a perfect sphere, but the concept of<br/>circumnavigation is nevertheless quite practical. I tend to suspect that<br/>when tuning an instrument by ear over 31 fifths, the variations in<br/>practice might be greater than the mathematical distinction in theory.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
