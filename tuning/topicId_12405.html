My only reservation would be<br/>whether other conductors/directors/presenters could get their cadres<br/>of players to achieve the same or similar results with the same<br/>notation. But with your close proximity to Johnny and the AFMM<br/>&quot;players,&quot; -- i.e., those specifically championing and realizing that<br/>system -- I would think that the quartertone +/- system is the<br/>absolute ideal way for you to go.</p><p>I&apos;m psyched that to hear that your going to put up the whole &quot;One<br/>Small Step for Man&quot; recording! Johnny&apos;s tone and articulation on that<br/>excerpt are just so muscular and well-defined... awesome. BTW, I also<br/>love Johnny&apos;s didjeridu trio with wonderfully colorful percussionist<br/>Yoshiaki Ochi. I wonder what, if any, impact the European free-jazz<br/>school had on JR&apos;s formative development as a composer and player?<br/>(Though I suppose that&apos;s a question for him and not for you!)</p><p>ds</p></div><h3><a id=12407 href="#12407">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/6/2000 10:46:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12405">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12405</a></p><p> But with your close proximity to Johnny and the AFMM<br/>&gt; &quot;players,&quot; -- i.e., those specifically championing and realizing<br/>that system -- I would think that the quartertone +/- system is the<br/>&gt; absolute ideal way for you to go.</p><p>Well, Johnny does make a good point that his players are ALREADY<br/>using this system... so it is certainly a factor!</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m psyched that to hear that you&apos;re going to put up the whole &quot;One<br/>&gt; Small Step for Man&quot; recording!

Originally I thought of <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> as a kind of &quot;sampler&quot;<br/>situation... with people only having a &quot;limited attention span&quot; on<br/>the Web... but I&apos;ve come to realize that the people who really are<br/>interested are going to listen to entire pieces.  Given the .mp3<br/>format file size... it means that pieces up to about 20 minutes can<br/>go on... and then, of course, each movement could be a separate file.<br/>The &quot;enhancements&quot; are in the plan...</p><p>Thanks for the nice comments!<br/>_________ ____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
