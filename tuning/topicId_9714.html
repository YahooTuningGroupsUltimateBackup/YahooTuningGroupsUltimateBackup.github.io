The subject heading is quite often all<br/>that is required to identify a reference (provided that multiple<br/>subjects are not discussed under a single subject heading). In cases<br/>where it is not enough, a brief quote that is to the point is all that<br/>is appropriate. Often, it is actually less work to simply send a new<br/>message to the list, with the subject heading copied from the post (or<br/>even typed in again). Doing this makes the list easier to read, less<br/>confusing, and does not take as much space to store or time to download.</p><p>    I hope that this has not offended anyone half as much as all those<br/>untrimmed replies offend me.</p><p>Denny Genovese</p></div>
