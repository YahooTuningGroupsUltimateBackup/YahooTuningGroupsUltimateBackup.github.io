They<br/>have assailed thousands before our day; they will afflict thousands in<br/>years to come and perhaps there is no form of interrogation so loaded<br/>with subtle torture,--unless it is to be asked for a light in a<br/>strange depot by a man you&apos;ve just selected out of seventeen thousand<br/>as the one man most likely to have a match.&quot; (Charles E. Ives,<br/>postlude, _114 SONGS_)</p><p>The following scale is one that I use in the second verse of an<br/>arrangement I did of Lowell Mason&apos;s hymn &quot;WORK FOR THE NIGHT IS<br/>COMING&quot;:</p><p>1/1, 8/7, 9/7, 7/5, 32/21, 12/7, 27/14, 2/1</p><p>It&apos;s a peculiar scale that I found by ear, and it can be analytically<br/>looked at in a number of different ways... for instance, I find this<br/>scale to most sound like a collection of 3s 7s and 11s, and as such it<br/>could also be looked at as say the IV of a:</p><p>11/6<br/>   \                ,21/16<br/>    \              ,<br/>    1/1---------3/2---------9/8--------27/16-------81/64</p><p>where the 7/5 is flattened by a 441/440:</p><p>88/63<br/>   \                ,1/1<br/>    \              ,<br/>   32/21--------8/7--------12/7---------9/7--------27/14</p><p>But really this scale seems to be just the type of JI scale that could<br/>benefit from tempering; say 17-tET where the scale is still strictly<br/>proper, the 243/242 disappears, and a series of apparently beneficial<br/>compromises are struck round the 64/63:</p><p>0 212 424 494 706 918 1059 1200<br/>0 212 282 494 706 847  988 1200<br/>0  71 282 494 635 776  988 1200<br/>0 212 424 565 706 918 1129 1200<br/>0 212 353 494 706 918  988 1200<br/>0 141 282 494 706 776  988 1200<br/>0 141 353 565 635 847 1059 1200</p><p>Only problem is, no matter what I seemed to try for a more<br/>analytically manageable compromise, none of them ever seemed to sound<br/>nearly as good as the original scale of 1/1, 8/7, 9/7, 7/5, 32/21,<br/>12/7, 27/14, 2/1, to me.

Or is it for melodic reasons that it needs to be 10/9? Perhaps to even out the first two steps. That second step (D to D#) is pretty small at 63 cents. But the 5th step (G to G#) is the same.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com">http://dkeenan.com</a></p></div>
