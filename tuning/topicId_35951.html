The major scale<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; originated from the spiral of fifths before triadic harmony was<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; recognized.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I think I&apos;m going to stay restricted to a &quot;logical&quot; discussion,<br/>&gt;&gt; rather than go into what happened historically. Maybe I should<br/>&gt;&gt; add a remark though, of what you just said.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; well, the advent of the major and minor modes was a historical<br/>&gt; phenomenon (around 1670), and before that the other modes were used<br/>&gt; perfectly &apos;logically&apos;, and just as frequently, if not more so. it is<br/>&gt; my strong belief that the *tritone* is the reason the major and minor<br/>&gt; modes &apos;won out&apos; -- the tritone is disjoint from the tonic triad<br/>&gt; *only* in the major and minor modes. the style that crystallized by<br/>&gt; 1670 is known commonly as &apos;tonality&apos; or &apos;western common-practice&apos;,<br/>&gt; and the resolution tritone played an all-important role in making<br/>&gt; this new kind of &apos;logic&apos; really work.</p><p>Right on the money, Paul. The kaleidoscopic frenzy of modulation that arose<br/>in the seventeenth century gives ample evidence that the &quot;true purpose&quot; of<br/>the tritone had been discovered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i don&apos;t think you can understand music without understanding its<br/>&gt; evolution. stick around and you may learn a lot about historical<br/>&gt; scales, tuning systems, and musical style -- particularly if margo<br/>&gt; chooses to join in our discussion (hint hint).</p><p>Yes.
