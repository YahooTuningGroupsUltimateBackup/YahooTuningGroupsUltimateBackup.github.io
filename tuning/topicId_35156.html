That&apos;s a *very* limited universe that people can<br/>&gt; PRACTICE.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I say that *that&apos;s* where the musicianship lies, in *practicing.*<br/>&gt;<br/>Really, why?  I stopped practicing years ago.  Ted Mook never practices and<br/>brags about it. I only learn new music.</p><p>&gt; PRACTICING 1200 per octave is just too much!  Where do you start?<br/>&gt; What intervals do you have them practice?  You can&apos;t do everything at<br/>&gt; once!<br/>&gt;</p><p>You are thinking that all 1200 &quot;intervals&quot; have to transversed.  What piece<br/>of music is in 1200 ET?  Think, 1200 gives all one needs (up to the + or - of<br/>.5 cents) for a performer to negotiate tuning specificity on their feet.</p><p>&gt; My pieces now come with a CD so that the player can PRACTICE the<br/>&gt; deviations of 33 cents and 17 cents from the 12-tET notes.  That&apos;s<br/>&gt; all they have to do.<br/>&gt;</p><p>So, continue sending the CD; it has nothing to do with notation.  It has for<br/>translating the notation into pitch.  You must be concerned because I think<br/>it unnecessary for the performer who will likely just pass it by.</p><p>&gt; Where&apos;s the math in that?  It&apos;s totally *real* musicianship, real<br/>&gt; playing.  It would take *years* to develop the same ability<br/>&gt; throughout the entire 1200 spectrum.  I wouldn&apos;t even know where to<br/>&gt; start.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is a misperception.  72 points within 1200 cents does not change a<br/>single pitch for performance.  The ear training is the same, except that<br/>there are differences of a few cents from JI intervals, further from other<br/>tunings.</p><p>&gt; Then, you wouldn&apos;t have to go past 25 from any given quartertone.<br/>&gt; And even *that* isn&apos;t enough, since you&apos;re saying they should be able<br/>&gt; to hit *every* cent.  I&apos;m exhausted, already, thinking about it!<br/>&gt;</p><p>This whole topic is exhausting.  But I continue it so that you guys don&apos;t<br/>theorize the success of cents out of the ascent in notation.</p><p>&gt; Frankly, that also is the &quot;problem&quot; with the incipient microtonal<br/>&gt; composer.  We don&apos;t know where to start after quarter tones.  At<br/>&gt; least, I will speak for my humble self.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It is necessary for the composer to hear intervals in their heads before for<br/>them to communicate them to musicians.  This is additional and separate from<br/>the presentation of the music itself.  Music rarely arrives unattended for<br/>its performance (meaning the composers are involved in rehearsals).  If you<br/>try to hear cents you will undoubtedly improve your microtonal ear.</p><p>&gt; When I started working with microtonality seriously, about one or two<br/>&gt; years ago... well, I&apos;d done pieces for years before, as you know, but<br/>&gt; not as intensively, the only thing I could think to do were quarter-<br/>&gt; tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What else would I do?  I didn&apos;t know.  I imagined the most reasonable<br/>&gt; thing to do in an alternate tuning was to try to do *pure*<br/>&gt; intervals.  This wasn&apos;t just my *own* idea, some other people also<br/>&gt; came up with it... :)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Surely, Joseph, you are on the right track now.  Maybe preaching what to do<br/>is beside the point.  Now that all different tunings are available to you,<br/>you could choose quite judiciously.  You better hope that when musicians are<br/>playing in 72-tone notation that it is accurate to the cent.</p><p>&gt; In any case, given this fact, I needed a *known universe* as a<br/>&gt; composer to work with.  Working with 72 does, indeed, limit my<br/>&gt; options, but they are the &quot;near just intonation&quot; options that I have<br/>&gt; been looking for to offset 12-tET and 24-tET and with 72-tET you can<br/>&gt; do *both* of these things at the same time, in a *very* easy and<br/>&gt; systematic way!<br/>&gt;</p><p>I have never said anything negative about 72-tone equal temperament tuning,<br/>in any of its compositional forms and usages.  I have only focused on<br/>notation for performers.</p><p>&gt; When Partch comes in ratios, my violist writes it out in cents (not<br/>&gt; 72).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***You should talk to Ted Mook, then, about this, since he *swears*<br/>&gt; by the 72-tET notation for easy performance of Partch.  And he&apos;s<br/>&gt; done, apparently *lots* of it, with several recordings out.  Several<br/>&gt; examples of his work with Partch in the 72-tET notation are shown<br/>&gt; here:<br/>&gt;<br/>Maybe that&apos;s why Ted uses lots of vibrato in his Partch, it covers a few<br/>cents here and there.  It goes a long way to explain Meredith Borden&apos;s need<br/>for vibrato for her soprano.  Maybe if they trained with cents they would be<br/>less automatic in their smudging over of exact pitch.  There are other vocal<br/>issues that we are not talking about, but I think vibrato masks pitch.</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.webcom.com/~tmook/lipo.html">http://www.webcom.com/~tmook/lipo.html</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>I bet the singer preferred the cents.  (Kalm has perfect pitch).  As I said,<br/>3 cents is too big to consider for me.</p><p>&gt; ***It would be an interesting test to have average performers read 72-<br/>&gt; tET intervals to a pitch counter and then read random 1200 pitches<br/>&gt; from number notation and see who would be the most accurate.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Try it with Julie.  Tell us about your experiences.</p><p>&gt; My personal feeling is that the players who have practiced 33 and 17<br/>&gt; over and over and over again would be the most accurate, insofar as<br/>&gt; getting at least *those* pitches right.<br/>&gt;</p><p>But then if the pitches are right, the intervals will be wrong.</p><p>&gt; People trying to pick out up to 25 or even 50 (as in *your* system)<br/>&gt; cents deviation from a quartertone might be &quot;lost at sea.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m saying, of course, to the *average* fine performer new to<br/>&gt; microtonality, not the ones that you have specially trained...<br/>&gt;<br/>You might as well distrust your surgeon.  No one is lost at sea.  You just<br/>have to set up the right communication.</p><p>&gt; Frankly, I don&apos;t believe it is fair to complain<br/>&gt; &gt; about which is harder when we have a living culture of musicians<br/>&gt; that play cents (and which therefore includes all others).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ****Well, and, apparently, there&apos;s an underground culture of 72-tET<br/>&gt; players around too, both in New York and Boston.  I&apos;m finding out<br/>&gt; more about this every day!<br/>&gt;</p><p>And they have all switched to cents except maybe Ted Mook, maybe.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As to covering JI intervals, 23 x 16.666 = 383.318.  That sucks as<br/>&gt; a just major third.  The JI composers would never accept that<br/>&gt; interval as a JI major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Well, I don&apos;t know.  Kraig Grady even seems to accept 72-tET and<br/>&gt; he&apos;s a kind of &quot;litmus test&quot; as it were.  That&apos;s the only ET he&apos;ll<br/>&gt; even CONSIDER.  And, yes, I admit, the thirds are 3 cents off.  That<br/>&gt; subtle distinction is, most probably lost on *me* personally,<br/>&gt; regrettably.<br/>&gt;</p><p>They were not good enough for Dean Drummond.  They are not good enough for me<br/>or my performances.</p><p>&gt; Besides, it is the 12-tET major third that is best represented.<br/>&gt; &gt; There is no real JI 383 cent interval.  I have had personal<br/>&gt; experience retraining a 72-trained musician with difficulty for this<br/>&gt; reason, who now composes in Werckmeister III (which would be a total<br/>&gt; waste in 72).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***Yes, it is true that many of the temperaments are not well<br/>&gt; represented by 72-tET.  But most of them aren&apos;t notated in CENTS.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Joseph, though we can use cents, or Savarts, or any single logrithm or<br/>monochord illustration, it&apos;s all about imagining sounds to be reproduced.<br/>Cents are fine enough to capture the essence of any tuning.  Why would one<br/>want to ghettoize a notation (except, of course, that is what the Early Music<br/>movement did by declaring their to be A=415, for distinction).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Now, I&apos;m not a musician, but dividing 12 into 1200 is mentally very<br/>&gt; &gt; comfortable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ****I wouldn&apos;t sell yourself short, Johnny!  You are a very *fine*<br/>&gt; musician!</p><p>You caught be there...really, I am not a mathematician.</p><p>&gt; You meant, of course, *mathematician...*  Well, I can&apos;t see where all<br/>&gt; the math is, frankly.  All I can see is the routine practicing of 33<br/>&gt; cents 17 cents deviations over and over and over again, just like we<br/>&gt; have to practice ANYTHING to get it right.  EVENTUALLY, it *will* be<br/>&gt; accurate.  But to practice the full spectrum?  Or to practice up to<br/>&gt; 25 cents (or 50?) away from a quartertone??\</p><p>These are pitches you are describing and there is nothing routine about them.<br/> 33 cents from where?   The last perfectly placed place?  Doesn&apos;t a shift of<br/>3 cents for the major third distort the pitch that will follow, and so on?<br/>We need the anchor of A=440 and a cents filter connects all of the tunings.<br/>Having +25 is as clear as any symbol.  It doesn&apos;t require an awareness of +24<br/>cents. It would be more likely heard in another piece as it would be foreign<br/>to any given piece with +25.</p><p>&gt; What kind of exercises for musicians *are* there for this<br/>&gt; practicing?  Do *you* have them?  Are they available in the way that<br/>&gt; the Maneri ear training exercises are available for musicians to<br/>&gt; practice??</p><p>Joe, have you every thought to ask any of the many musicians that you know<br/>whom I work with?  Certainly we have all be trusting my ear.  We do not use a<br/>machine.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve never seen such exercises.  If we *train* people, we need<br/>&gt; exercises, so it seems to *me!*<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not *doubting* this is possible, I&apos;ve just *never* seen the 1200<br/>&gt; ear training procedures as of yet.  Maybe they are around.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You have the results right before your ears and you haven&apos;t even noticed.<br/>Manuel, is this amazing?</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t know if I can buy the thought that such practicing can come<br/>&gt; in play by just playing *pieces!*  There&apos;s not enough reiteration of<br/>&gt; the same *intervals* in playing pieces.<br/>&gt;</p><p>You cannot confuse the pedagogical aspect of apprehending a tuning and then<br/>composing within it with the objective performance of another.  You have not<br/>rights to reiterating anything, only a simple legend.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s like using Czerny to gain piano finger dexterity.  Not great<br/>&gt; music, not too much fun, but it develops the *technique!*<br/>&gt;<br/>Actually, maybe that is our concept difference.  You imagine music as digital<br/>buttons to push while I seen it as a continuum.</p><p>&gt; Quartertones are big in microtonal music, particularly in size.<br/>&gt; &gt;  Shaving it down into half and quarters is no harder than shading<br/>&gt; by 14 cents for an accurate 386 cent JI major third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***I think for many players it would be hard to shade down by exactly<br/>&gt; 14 cents.  Why more than 17?  Well, simply because the player has<br/>&gt; been playing so *many* 17 deviations.  Unless there is more such<br/>&gt; training for 14 shadings, I&apos;m not sure I can buy that...</p><p>Then you would be foolish.  14 cents from an equal tempered pitch is exactly<br/>14 cents flat (to the cent).  If one cannot play a perfect 5/4 major third of<br/>386 cents repeatably and always convincingly there is no room for them on an<br/>AFMM concert.  Every musician in the AFMM can play this interval.  Each does<br/>it in a different way and you with certainly hurt your noggin trying to<br/>figure out how each and everyone does it.  More important than not<br/>understanding how they play the music is that they do!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Please understand, I am excited for the activity in Boston, know<br/>&gt; well both Ezra and Joe, and realize that some (like soprano Meredith<br/>&gt; Borden) can proceed naturally to a JI world of intervals.  But I bet<br/>&gt; they never go back.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***You mean once we&apos;ve gone into Just there is no turning back?<br/>&gt; That&apos;s *scary* Johnny.  It&apos;s a little like the &quot;Night of the Living<br/>&gt; Dead...&quot;</p><p>Please don&apos;t misrepresent me.  JI are some of nature&apos;s essence of intervals.<br/>They are not the only ones.  But once the genie is let out of the bottle...</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>asarkiss &#x3C;asarkiss@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/3/2002 12:01:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Surely, Joseph, you are on the right track now.

Admittedly, in the field of<br/>microtonality I am only a &quot;toddler&quot; and *you&apos;re* a &quot;full adult...&quot;<br/>I&apos;ll be absolutely the first to admit this verifiable fact.  For this<br/>reason, I&apos;m especially pleased that you took the time with me to go<br/>over some of this notation theory.</p><p>Basically, I think there is no question but that your system of cents<br/>is more versatile and accurate on the overall.  Certainly no one<br/>would suggest you change this basic modus operandi.</p><p>I guess, in *my* case, I&apos;m finding that 72-tET gives me a kind<br/>of &quot;limited universe&quot; that helps my microtonal thinking as I create<br/>pieces.  So, yes, my pieces are *basically* 72-tET pieces these days,<br/>in their *own* universe of 72, as you attest.</p><p>So, the question really boils down to *that* rather than 72 as a<br/>universal *notational* ideal.  For that, yes, cents is best.</p><p>HOWEVER, I&apos;m hoping that with the simple Sims symbols in use for 72,<br/>performers can easily read that, and they don&apos;t even have to read two<br/>digit numbers, as they do in the cents system.</p><p>BUT, if it turns out this is a problem, it&apos;s no &quot;biggie&quot; since I will<br/>simply write the cents deviations over the notes!  Then, it&apos;s in<br/>*cents notation* of course, so the issue is &quot;solved.&quot;</p><p>Maybe I should just stop it at that, since I&apos;m really not advocating<br/>72 as a *universal* language to describe all alternate tuning.  That<br/>would be rather silly, since it can&apos;t even do any of the meantones or<br/>well-temperaments accurately.</p><p>And, since you present a MYRIAD of different tunings on the AFMM<br/>concerts, including many historical works, clearly a 72-tET base<br/>would be wrong for those purposes.</p><p>So, essentially, I believe we are in agreement!</p><p>Thanks so much for the time and commentary!</p><p>jp</p></div>
