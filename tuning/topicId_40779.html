Each of those dots is a tetrad.</p><p>Anyway, here is a helpful diagram to show how the octahedron and<br/>tetrahedron tiling works:</p><p><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mt/marksomers/Fig12.2.html">http://www.angelfire.com/mt/marksomers/Fig12.2.html</a></p><p>from figure 12.2 in<br/><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mt/marksomers/115.html">http://www.angelfire.com/mt/marksomers/115.html</a><br/>(about Buckminster Fuller&apos;s ideas for this tiling).</p><p>so you have tetrahedra inscribed in every cube of the regular cubic<br/>tiling, and you have octahedra centred on alternate vertices of<br/>all the cubes.</p><p>Incidentally here is another page with a proposal to use octahedra<br/>and tetrahedra as building blocks for buildings:</p><p><a href="http://www.tabletoptelephone.com/~hopspage/Index.html">http://www.tabletoptelephone.com/~hopspage/Index.html</a></p><p>Then to find one of the planes of the 3 5 7 lattice, you just look at<br/>the plane parallel to any face of the octahedron (equivalently<br/>tetrahedron)</p><p>Then as you said, the vertices of the 3 5 7 lattice are<br/>the vertices of the cubic tiling - but with alternate<br/>vertices omitted in each plane of the cubic tiling..</p><p>This makes the tiling for the notes into the face centred cubic<br/>(the notes rather than the tetrads).</p><p>see</p><p><a href="http://www.ucdsb.on.ca/tiss/stretton/chem2/arch19.htm">http://www.ucdsb.on.ca/tiss/stretton/chem2/arch19.htm</a></p><p>- the unit cell shown there is the same as the entire diagram<br/>in</p><p><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mt/marksomers/Fig12.2.html">http://www.angelfire.com/mt/marksomers/Fig12.2.html</a></p><p>and you can see the octahedron in the centre, and trace<br/>the way that it connects with the others using triangles<br/>- while the tetrads are at the centres of all the cubes in<br/><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mt/marksomers/Fig12.2.html">http://www.angelfire.com/mt/marksomers/Fig12.2.html</a><br/>so those form a cubic tiling as you say.</p><p>Which I think makes it all clear for those who like to<br/>look at these things geometrically.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=40798 href="#40798">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/10/2002 7:33:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;clumma@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Eureka.
