The<br/>Chopra family are all safe.  In the midst of the world&apos;s tragedy,<br/>Deepak has been barraged with questions from the media requesting his<br/>perspective. Here&apos;s his response that he also wanted to share with<br/>his Namaste friends.</p><p>P.S. Please join us at the prayer circle boards at<br/><a href="http://www.chopra.com/">http://www.chopra.com/</a></p><p>------------------------------</p><p>The Deeper Wound</p><p>As fate would have it, I was leaving New York on a jet flight that<br/>took off 45 minutes before the unthinkable happened. By the time we<br/>landed in Detroit, chaos had broken out. When I grasped the fact that<br/>American security had broken down so tragically, I couldn&apos;t respond<br/>at first. My wife and son were also in the air on separate flights,<br/>one to Los Angeles, one to San Diego. My body went absolutely rigid<br/>with fear. All I could think about was their safety, and it took<br/>several hours before I found out that their flights had been diverted<br/>and both were safe.</p><p>Strangely, when the good news came, my body still felt that it had<br/>been hit by a truck.  Of its own accord it seemed to feel a far<br/>greater trauma that reached out to the thousands who would not<br/>survive and the tens of thousands who would survive only to live<br/>through months and years of hell.</p><p>And I asked myself, Why didn&apos;t I feel this way last week? Why didn&apos;t<br/>my body go stiff during the bombing of Iraq or Bosnia? Around the<br/>world my horror and worry are experienced every day. Mothers weep<br/>over horrendous loss, civilians are bombed mercilessly, refugees are<br/>ripped from any sense of home or homeland.  Why did I not feel their<br/>anguish enough to call a halt to it?</p><p>As we hear the calls for tightened American security and a fierce<br/>military response to terrorism, it is obvious that none of us has any<br/>answers. However, we feel compelled to ask some questions.</p><p>Everything has a cause, so we have to ask, What was the root cause of<br/>this evil? We must find out not superficially but at the deepest<br/>level. There is no doubt that such evil is alive all around the world<br/>and is even celebrated. Does this evil grow from the suffering and<br/>anguish felt by people we don&apos;t know and therefore ignore? Have they<br/>lived in this condition for a long time?</p><p>One assumes that whoever did this attack feels implacable hatred for<br/>America. Why were we selected to be the focus of suffering around the<br/>world?</p><p>All this hatred and anguish seems to have religion at its basis.<br/>Isn&apos;t something terribly wrong when jihads and wars develop in the<br/>name of God?</p><p>Isn&apos;t God invoked with hatred in Ireland, Sri Lanka, India,<br/>Pakistan, Israel, Palestine, and even among the intolerant sects of<br/>America?</p><p>Can any military response make the slightest difference in the<br/>underlying cause? Is there not a deep wound at the heart of humanity?</p><p>If there is a deep wound, doesn&apos;t it affect everyone?</p><p>When generations of suffering respond with bombs, suicidal attacks,<br/>and biological warfare, who first developed these weapons? Who sells<br/>them?</p><p>Who gave birth to the satanic technologies now being turned against<br/>us?</p><p>If all of us are wounded, will revenge work?</p><p>Will punishment in any form toward anyone solve the wound or<br/>aggravate it?</p><p>Will an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and limb for a limb,<br/>leave us all blind, toothless and crippled?</p><p>Tribal warfare has been going on for two thousand years and has now<br/>been magnified globally. Can tribal warfare be brought to an end? Is<br/>patriotism and nationalism even relevant anymore, or is this another<br/>form of tribalism?</p><p>What are you and I as persons going to do about what is happening? Can<br/>we afford to let the deeper wound fester any longer?</p><p>Everyone is calling this an attack on America, but is it not a rift in<br/>our collective soul? Isn&apos;t this an attack on civilization from<br/>without that is also from within?</p><p>When we have secured our safety once more and cared for the wounded,<br/>after the period of shock and mourning is over, it will be time for<br/>soul searching. I only hope that these questions are confronted with<br/>the deepest spiritual intent. None of us will feel safe again behind<br/>the shield of military might and stockpiled arsenals. There can be no<br/>safety until the root cause is faced.</p><p>In this moment of shock I don&apos;t think anyone of us has the answers.<br/>It is imperative that we pray and offer solace and help to each<br/>other.  But if you and I are  having a single thought of violence or<br/>hatred against anyone in the world at this moment, we are contributing<br/>to the wounding of the world.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Deepak</p></div>
