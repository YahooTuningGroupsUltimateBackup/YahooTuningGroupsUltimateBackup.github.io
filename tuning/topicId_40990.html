I<br/>didn&apos;t see any as being any easier to read nor any better than what we<br/>already have. Multi-part vocal scores requre staves to be separated so words<br/>can be put between. Orchestral/band socres requrie the same for the various<br/>intsrruments.</p><p>The present notation system is as well established wordwide as the 12-note<br/>keyboard. The thing to do is to work with these systems with slight<br/>midifications rather than something different.</p><p>The notation I use fro my JT organ is the same as the traditional, with 0 and<br/>7 added above, below, or to the left of notes when a split digital is used.</p><p>Where 0 = the 12-ET note series, and 7 = a harmonic minor 7th.</p><p>The same score played on non-keyboard instruments or sung requires adding<br/> - and - 7 to the score.</p><p>Where  - = the just major 3rd series worth 386 cents, whether just or<br/>slightly tempered, and  -7 = a harmonic minor 7th for the 386 notes.</p><p>Thus my JI/JT notation is the simplest I know of!</p><p>If a more complex notation is wanted, such as for the 11th or 13th harmonics,<br/>just add the harmonic #s to the respective score notes.</p><p>In this regard, the 13th harmonic wirth 841 cents is A rather than Ab (as<br/>listed in Helmholtz). Ab is 807 (harmonic), 814 (via the 13th harmonic 841+<br/>969 + 702 + 702), or 816 (from the F#/Gb 5th series from C 0) cents.</p><p>If uncommon cents values beyond usual tempering are wanted, just add the<br/>cents #s to the respective score notes.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Pauline W.

What you have is essentially a<br/>&gt; *specialized* notation for the employment of extended techniques for<br/>&gt; altering pitch on 12-ET instruments.</p><p>I must agree with Paul&apos;s comments to this post.  I would only add a few<br/>things.  The instruments I use are not &quot;12-ET instruments.  Surely the<br/>strings are not.  The brass are based on JI.  And the woodwinds have a<br/>different pitch direction for each note (some sharp, some flat).  None of<br/>these, including the voice, are 12-ET.</p><p>And it is not so much specialized for 12 other than it is the common basis<br/>for present notation reading.  This way we all move together.  Also, it is a<br/>convenient breakdown of pitch.</p><p> It would be so cumbersome as to &gt;<br/>&gt; be nearly useless for notating music for a microtonal keyboard, a<br/>&gt; refretted guitar, or other specially built microtonal instruments.</p><p>I agree, unless it is a new keyboard as we have designed.  Tablature, or<br/>Partch instrument-specific notation is still vital.  I am talking<br/>professional musicians that already read music for performances.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And it is cents<br/>&gt; &gt; specific, but it includes a basic quartertone notation so that the<br/>&gt; numbers<br/>&gt; &gt; are below 50 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you saying that you are also using quartertone symbols, or am I<br/>&gt; misunderstanding this.  Deviations from 12-ET already require only +/-<br/>&gt; 50 cents.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes.  I have described these quartertone notations in earlier posts.  (can&apos;t<br/>draw them here).</p><p>&gt; &gt; It may not be what the List fully endorses,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is because we&apos;re looking for a simple *generalized* notation<br/>&gt; that conveys harmonic meaning without reference to any specific<br/>&gt; division of the octave.</p><p>The quartertone symbols help convey harmonic meaning by showing tonal<br/>relationships, rather than inharmonic ones.  Overly focussing on harmonic<br/>meaning dangerously wastes the prescriptive needs of notation to inform the<br/>musician rapidly.</p><p>With the cents notation you are relating &gt; everything to 12-ET, and one must<br/>&gt; become a number cruncher in order<br/>&gt; to understand the harmonic relationships in the music.</p><p>Paul is right.  I just hear cents.  Everything is instantaneous.  Most<br/>measurement is melodic (on a melodic instrument).  The harmonic sense is<br/>&quot;settled into&quot; after the successive note is initiated.  Cents in linear and<br/>most helpful.  I am in no way a number cruncher, and my players even less so.</p><p>I&apos;m sure &gt; you&apos;re aware that cents numbers for intervals change from one<br/>&gt; tuning<br/>&gt; to another, so you have to learn how to translate cents to (exact or<br/>&gt; tempered) ratios or system degrees for each tuning.  It would make<br/>&gt; analysis of a score a nightmare.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is a misunderstanding.  We keep A=440 at all times.  It is always one of<br/>the 1200 cents.  In this way there is no such a thing as transposition.

(ascii simulation), I *can* immediately perceive<br/>&gt; something like:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G B D in 19-ET, or<br/>&gt; G B\! D in 22-ET</p><p>where did the differences between the different Gs go? i thought the<br/>performer had to compare these triads directly.</p><p>&gt; And if I&apos;m in 19-ET and you throw B\! at me, I&apos;ll ignore the 5-<br/>comma-<br/>&gt; down symbol, because I know that the 5 comma vanishes in 19.</p><p>so i could turn this around and ask you how the performer is supposed<br/>to perceive the difference between G B\! D in 22-ET and G B\! D in 19-<br/>ET. the mental gymnastics required are surely much more involved than<br/>the simple subtraction of cents.</p><p>&gt; Sure,<br/>&gt; you need to learn the 5-comma symbol, that one symbol will serve<br/>for<br/>&gt; *any* tuning.</p><p>even a tuning that has no basis in both the 3rd and the 5th<br/>harmonics? or an irregular tuning system, like Werckmeister III?</p><p>&gt; &gt; on the other hand, i&apos;ve seen one of the best and most experienced<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonal musicians look at a set of a dozen or so ratios and<br/>fail<br/>&gt; &gt; to see that there were any just perfect fifths in the scale,<br/>where<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; fact there were several.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I&apos;m not advocating a notation that puts ratios on the page,<br/>&gt; either.  The numbers don&apos;t have to be very large to be difficult to<br/>&gt; comprehend.</p><p>the same is true for your multiple comma signifiers with different<br/>meanings for multitudes of tuning systems.</p><p>&gt; &gt; but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it&apos;s not a *universal* or even a *generalized* notation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; why isn&apos;t it universal? are you claiming you need better than 1<br/>&gt; cent<br/>&gt; &gt; resolution for live acoustic music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not a matter of resolution.  &quot;Universal&quot; is a pretty broad<br/>term,<br/>&gt; and there are still places in the world where (thankfully)<br/>musicians<br/>&gt; aren&apos;t thinking in 12-ET.

I would only add a<br/>few<br/>&gt; things.  The instruments I use are not &quot;12-ET instruments.  Surely<br/>the<br/>&gt; strings are not.</p><p>They&apos;re Pythagorean, which is pretty close to 12-ET, as is the mind-<br/>set of string players; so the habits and training of the player must<br/>be considered as a part of the instrument.

This way we all move together.<br/>Also, it is a<br/>&gt; convenient breakdown of pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It would be so cumbersome as to<br/>&gt; &gt; be nearly useless for notating music for a microtonal keyboard, a<br/>&gt; &gt; refretted guitar, or other specially built microtonal<br/>instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree, unless it is a new keyboard as we have designed.</p><p>You&apos;ll have to elaborate on that sometime.  Anyway, I don&apos;t think<br/>that a notation is truly &quot;universal&quot; unless it can be used for *any*<br/>tuning on *any* instrument.  And I don&apos;t even claim that for the<br/>sagittal notation that Dave Keenan and I have developed, so I would<br/>call it &quot;generalized.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Tablature, or<br/>&gt; Partch instrument-specific notation is still vital.  I am talking<br/>&gt; professional musicians that already read music for performances.</p><p>I hate tablatures with a vengeance!!!  To put a G-sharp on a score<br/>and expect an 11/9 (or whatever is on somebody&apos;s scordatura keyboard)<br/>for one instrument and have it mean 7/4 for another instrument may<br/>give quick results, but it obscures the meaning of the symbols.<br/>Perhaps I am just taking this personally, but having absolute pitch,<br/>I am accustomed to *reading* symbols, *thinking* pitches, and then<br/>*playing* them.  I also happen to think tranposing instruments are<br/>for the birds.  When I learned to play the clarinet, trumpet, and<br/>French horn, I treated them as non-transposing instruments and<br/>learned all of the notes at concert pitch.  I also learned to read<br/>the tenor clef (an octave higher) and mezzo-soprano clef (middle C on<br/>the 2nd line) so that I could read their parts as if they were<br/>written for C instruments.  (Another French horn player with absolute<br/>pitch that I met did it exactly the same way.)  If this sounds like I<br/>had to go to a lot of trouble, I also found that it had its benefits,<br/>because since I treat every instrument as if it were in C, then I can<br/>sight-read any part on any instrument, e.g., a trombone or viola part<br/>on the French horn, because they have the *same* notation.</p><p>I really hope that the world won&apos;t have to put up with microtonal<br/>transposing instruments.  If somebody sets about designing new ones,<br/>*please* have them sound as written!</p><p>(So now you know why I am so much in favor of new instruments and why<br/>I strived so hard to get a generalized keyboard.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; And it is cents<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; specific, but it includes a basic quartertone notation so that<br/>the numbers<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; are below 50 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Are you saying that you are also using quartertone symbols, or am<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; misunderstanding this.  Deviations from 12-ET already require<br/>only +/-<br/>&gt; &gt; 50 cents.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.  I have described these quartertone notations in earlier<br/>posts.  (can&apos;t<br/>&gt; draw them here).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It may not be what the List fully endorses,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is because we&apos;re looking for a simple *generalized* notation<br/>&gt; &gt; that conveys harmonic meaning without reference to any specific<br/>&gt; &gt; division of the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The quartertone symbols help convey harmonic meaning by showing<br/>tonal<br/>&gt; relationships, rather than inharmonic ones.  Overly focussing on<br/>harmonic<br/>&gt; meaning dangerously wastes the prescriptive needs of notation to<br/>inform the<br/>&gt; musician rapidly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the cents notation you are relating<br/>&gt; everything to 12-ET, and one must<br/>&gt; &gt; become a number cruncher in order<br/>&gt; &gt; to understand the harmonic relationships in the music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul is right.  I just hear cents.<br/>&gt; Everything is instantaneous.</p><p>How long did it take you to develop this ability?</p><p>&gt; Most<br/>&gt; measurement is melodic (on a melodic instrument).  The harmonic<br/>sense is<br/>&gt; &quot;settled into&quot; after the successive note is initiated.  Cents in<br/>linear and<br/>&gt; most helpful.  I am in no way a number cruncher, and my players<br/>even less so.</p><p>It&apos;s just that when you&apos;re playing a harmonic instrument (keyboard,<br/>guitar, etc.) this is not meaninful and therefore not universal.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m sure<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;re aware that cents numbers for intervals change from one<br/>tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; to another, so you have to learn how to translate cents to (exact<br/>or<br/>&gt; &gt; tempered) ratios or system degrees for each tuning.  It would<br/>make<br/>&gt; &gt; analysis of a score a nightmare.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a misunderstanding.  We keep A=440 at all times.  It is<br/>always one of<br/>&gt; the 1200 cents.  In this way there is no such a thing as<br/>transposition.  And<br/>&gt; no nightmares.</p><p>But every other note changes, so your F, C, G, D, E, B, etc. are<br/>different in almost every tuning.  And if one of those is the key<br/>you&apos;re playing in, then your tonic pitch shifts around with different<br/>tunings.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; but it is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; time tested and there are many musicians that are comfortable<br/>with it,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; preferring it to all others.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I can&apos;t disagree that it works well for what you&apos;re using it for,<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s not a *universal* or even a *generalized* notation.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --George<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From the point of view of performing microtonal music in all<br/>systems on<br/>&gt; traditional orchestral instruments or the voice, I would have to<br/>insist it is<br/>&gt; &quot;A single notation for any tuning.&quot;</p><p>But not for every instrument, and especially not for a specially-<br/>designed-and-built microtonal instrument.</p><p>However, you will also need to read my next posting, because it is<br/>not my intention that the sagittal notation should replace yours.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2002 2:25:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Paul mentioned my preference.

George, you&apos;ve always impressed me as someone who looks at all the pieces of the puzzle, so let me add the following: *my* particular genesis is as a percussionist, and there are reams of printed scores and parts that - to us - are nothing so much as tablature. I may very well know that a given symbol may be a cymbal :) but by looking at the page I don&apos;t know exactly what it will sound like. Not to mention the many pieces that are very carefully notated for multiple percussion or sound sources that yield little, if any, visible information as to what it will sound like.</p><p>How would a generalized notation system cope with an instrument that, when one button is pressed or one key is struck, emits an entire chord, or entire cacaphony? I don&apos;t expect a notation to work with all other instruments to work with this one, and my ear/brain combination don&apos;t fight the result.</p><p>Naturally, the above all proceeds from my given musical path, as do your preferences/preconceptions. I offer this only as grist for the mill, and as testimony to the flexiblity of performers of many kinds of music. Tablature&apos;s giant wart - that the score cannot be analyzed without great difficulty and translation - doesn&apos;t go away. But there just may be instances where nothing else suffices.</p><p>(And, yes, I realize that your notation is being targeted at instruments more in line with traditional notation...)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2002 5:01:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41060">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41060</a></p><p> wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;jpehrson@r...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41038">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41038</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; re my meaning of inharmonic as in notation (and I&apos;m sneezing<br/>with<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; cold<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; here), what I am getting out is that I am trying to spell out<br/>&gt; &gt; notations as it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; was used traditionally while avoiding mathematical equivalence.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would use A up to  C +32<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Rather than A up to C quarter-sharp -18<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; But I would prefer A up to C quarter-sharp +12<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Rather than A up to C# -38<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I might use a C# for one pitch that repeats, but choose a Db<br/>for<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; near<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; neighbor that distinguishes itself.

It<br/>is &quot;universal&quot; in the sense that it can notate any tuning, but it<br/>depends on a 12-ET frame of reference that is not particularly useful<br/>for (retuned) instruments of fixed pitch or specially built<br/>microtonal instruments.</p><p>2) A &quot;generalized&quot; notation such as Dave Keenan and I have produced<br/>excels at indicating specific pitches and intervals that have been<br/>separately defined in some sort of &quot;preface&quot; or &quot;attachment&quot; to a<br/>musical composition, and this provides *general* harmonic and melodic<br/>information that is useful for performers of specially-built or<br/>retuned instruments and also for study of a score.  However, this<br/>sort of notation does not go out of its way to help flexible-pitch<br/>instrumentalists (and vocalists) using unmodified 12-ET hardware and<br/>resources to locate actual pitches, on the assumption that this<br/>should be acquired by training and practice.</p><p>To decide which approach is &quot;better&quot; than the other misses the point -<br/>- each has its strengths and weaknesses.  As I wrote in the last part<br/>of my paper, for instruments of flexible pitch the printed parts need<br/>to have both of these approaches *combined*.  This is something that<br/>Dave and I discussed a couple of months ago on tuning-math, and here<br/>was my conclusion (msg. #4638, 12 Sep 02):</p><p>&lt;&lt; My recommendation is to have the cents written above the notes in<br/>any and every part for an instrument of flexible pitch.  Those who<br/>don&apos;t need them can ignore them, and those who do will be able to<br/>memorize them as they become familiar with the [sagittal] notation. &gt;&gt;</p><p>And just so there is no mistake about how supportive I am of Johnny<br/>Reinhard&apos;s cents notation, let me quote from my upcoming paper:</p><p>&lt;&lt; There is a notation devised by Johnny Reinhard that would seem to<br/>overcome this problem [i.e., lack of a generalized notation] in that<br/>it is not specific to any particular tuning.  It is extremely easy to<br/>comprehend, and he has claimed that excellent results can be obtained<br/>with it.

I think you imply that such a<br/>&gt; rule is enforced by FTS ?</p><p>Yes. You choose any multiple of 100 for the octave.<br/>So if you have say 31*100 cents per octave then it still is<br/>reasonable to call them cents because you have 100 of them to<br/>each step of 31-et. Just as reasonable as to call 1200 of them<br/>to an octave cents anyway.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><p>Major chord in cents:</p><p>386.314 701.955 1200.0</p><p>In 31-et cents:</p><p>31=997.978  31=1813.38  31=3100.0</p><p>The = there is a kind of shorthand notation for<br/>&quot;equal temperament&quot;... :-). Read it as<br/>&quot;thirty one equals 998.978&quot;.</p><p>You have to do it all as one word<br/>31=997.978 to make it clear where one entry ends and the<br/>next begins otherwise the 31 there might be read as a 31/1.<br/>like this: 31, =997.978.</p><p>You can also use the same idea for non octave scales.</p><p>For an example of a non octave scale,</p><p>9(3/2)=495.306  9(3/2)=900.0  9(3/2)=1538.56</p><p>That is the major chord in Wendy Carlos&apos;s alpha scale of<br/>9 equal divisions of 3/2. As you see, you put the interval of<br/>repetition in brackets after the number of multiples of<br/>&quot;100 cents&quot; that fit into it.</p><p>I call these notations all relative cents.</p><p>Then if you like, you can choose to call any of the notations plain cents<br/>by selecting a box &quot;Set this notation as the one to call &quot;cents&quot;</p><p>The advantage of doing that is that you can then use the word cents<br/>when entering values, and use shortcuts such as the SCALA convention<br/>that decimal point = cents.</p><p>You can then use 12= to enter 12-et based values.<br/>For instance if you have switched the default<br/>notation to Wendy Carlos&apos;s alpha, you could enter the<br/>major chord in mixed notation as:</p><p>495.306 12=701.955 2/1</p><p>In these examples I&apos;ve assumed that one has selected<br/>File | Number Options | Use SCALA convention: decimal<br/>points for cents, as most will who use FTS for scales work.</p><p>Otherwise you need to use the word cents, like this<br/>for 31-et major chord:</p><p>997.977 cents31= 1813.38 cents31= 3100 cents31=</p><p>etc.</p><p>I also have an option to use any base for the number system<br/>in the range 2 to 36, as explained  - but you can read all about that in the help<br/>for the window. Similarly you can use whatever number of &quot;cents&quot; to an octave<br/>you like - they don&apos;t _have_ to be multiples of 100. E.g. one could show<br/>Gene&apos;s yen that he has just posted about. In fact you can even<br/>have fractional numbers of cents per octave or non octave.</p><p>So, anyway all this is up and running in FTS so you can give it a go<br/>and see what it feels like.</p><p>If you use ordinary cents notation then it gets understood normally<br/>and many, probably most FTS users will never need to know that you can use this<br/>notation to enter values in relative cents too. It&apos;s quite hidden<br/>away, but one will find it if one explores the File | Number Options<br/>window - and there is help for it there too that explains it in<br/>detail - click on the blue ? icon for the window.</p><p>Then if you want to use one of these special notations then<br/>you can enter them at any time by just using the appropriate<br/>notation, e.g. ... cents31  or 31=... and this will be understood<br/>no matter what notation is currently being used to show the<br/>scales - because it is unambiguous so FTS will always be able<br/>to read it.</p><p>The window also has an option to show all the scales as cents diffs<br/>from n-et for any n, in these various notations.</p><p>I got the idea of exploring alternaative cents notatons from<br/>a post by Margo suggesing the iota (1700 cents to an octave).<br/>Gene suggested the name relative cents.</p><p>Anyway this is something I did for fun really a while back, and find useful on<br/>occasion.

We concluded that both the<br/>double-symbol and single-symbol versions have their separate<br/>advantages, so we are presenting the notation in both versions and<br/>letting the microtonal marketplace decide if one, the other, or both<br/>should be used.</p><p>4) In the adaptive JI example (URL above) there are five new symbols<br/>shown in the musical example and 12 altogether in the sequence to the<br/>right (not counting the vertical mirroring that converts an &quot;up&quot;<br/>symbol to a &quot;down&quot; symbol).  This is for 217-ET or 17-limit JI mapped<br/>to 217, which is a rather complicated application.  And even this is<br/>only a subset of the grand total of 30 symbols that are used for<br/>larger ETs and JI prime number limits above 17.  However, it&apos;s not<br/>necessary to learn all of the symbols of the sagittal notation in<br/>order to begin using it - only those required for a particular<br/>tuning or prime number limit.  For examle, 53-ET and 72-ET each<br/>require only 3 new symbols, and 94-ET requires 5.  Additional symbols<br/>can always be learned as needed for other tunings or higher prime<br/>limits.  Our objective was to have a large superset of symbols that<br/>would handle a lot of different tunings, and when it&apos;s necessary to<br/>learn the notation for a new tuning, you don&apos;t discard what you&apos;ve<br/>already learned; instead you build on it.</p><p>I hope this answers a few questions.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/26/2002 12:08:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Joel Rodrigues &lt;jdrodrigues@P...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41209">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/41209</a></p><p>&gt; Sorry, no good understanding of it yet.

Multi-part vocal scores requre staves to be separated<br/>so words<br/>&gt; can be put between.

The thing to do is to work with these systems with slight<br/>&gt; midifications rather than something different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The notation I use fro my JT organ is the same as the traditional,<br/>with 0 and<br/>&gt; 7 added above, below, or to the left of notes when a split digital<br/>is used.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where 0 = the 12-ET note series, and 7 = a harmonic minor 7th.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The same score played on non-keyboard instruments or sung requires<br/>adding<br/>&gt;  - and - 7 to the score.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Where  - = the just major 3rd series worth 386 cents, whether just<br/>or<br/>&gt; slightly tempered, and  -7 = a harmonic minor 7th for the 386 notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus my JI/JT notation is the simplest I know of!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If a more complex notation is wanted, such as for the 11th or 13th<br/>harmonics,<br/>&gt; just add the harmonic #s to the respective score notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this regard, the 13th harmonic wirth 841 cents is A rather than<br/>Ab (as<br/>&gt; listed in Helmholtz). Ab is 807 (harmonic), 814 (via the 13th<br/>harmonic 841+<br/>&gt; 969 + 702 + 702), or 816 (from the F#/Gb 5th series from C 0) cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If uncommon cents values beyond usual tempering are wanted, just<br/>add the<br/>&gt; cents #s to the respective score notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sincerely,<br/>&gt; Pauline W.
