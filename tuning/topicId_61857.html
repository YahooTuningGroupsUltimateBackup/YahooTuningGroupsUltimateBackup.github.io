Do I hear<br/>&gt;&gt; the 19-limit, or perhaps the 23-limit?

No.  But I think it may be.  Would a musical tuning that<br/>&gt;&gt;      requires 137-limit intervals be meaningful, Paul, if we<br/>&gt;&gt;      couldn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;      hear the difference between that and, say, the 19-limit?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Musical tunings &quot;meaningful&quot;? That&apos;s not the question.</p><p>You ask your questions; I&apos;ll ask mine.  Rephrasing mine, since you<br/>misunderstood it:  Would there be any point in defining a tuning<br/>that requires distinctions that no one can ever possibly hear?<br/>And clearly the queston is rhetorical.</p><p>&gt; ... But the<br/>&gt; question of whether a particular prime limit is or isn&apos;t in<br/>&gt; force . . . since there&apos;s no limit on the sizes of the numbers in the<br/>&gt; ratios, you can always find more and more ratios within the prime<br/>&gt; limit that are closer and closer to a given ratio.</p><p>If your inference above had been correct, this might be relevant.<br/>It wasn&apos;t, so it isn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; At what point do<br/>&gt; these high-numbered ratios leave the realm of musical relevance? Of<br/>&gt; course it depends on the tuning system, but my point is that a prime<br/>&gt; limit alone doesn&apos;t seem to be capable of unambiguously corresponding<br/>&gt; or not corresponding, in general, to an arbitrary tuning system, via<br/>&gt; any aural or even mathematical test, as long as one recognizes a<br/>&gt; finite uncertainty in hearing intervals (or even merely the minimal<br/>&gt; uncertainty allowed by the classical uncertainty<br/>&gt; principle . . .) . . . The exceptions would seem to be cases where an<br/>&gt; odd, integer, or other &quot;finitary&quot; limit is ascertained first, and<br/>&gt; then the prime limit is simply taken as the largest prime not<br/>&gt; exceeding that limit.</p><p>I don&apos;t disagree, but I was focussing on what prime limits<br/>I can distinguish, rather than on what overall (odd) limit I<br/>can distinguish.  I agree that fixing the latter sets an upper<br/>bound on the former.  In an earlier message, I found that<br/>a listener&apos;s odd limit must lie somewhere near or below 101,<br/>on the unproven assumption that the frequency resolution of<br/>that listener&apos;s hearing is at best 2 cents.</p><p>But you may recall that what I asked was:<br/>&gt;&gt; ...  Do I hear the 19-limit, or perhaps the 23-limit?</p><p>I&apos;m still no nearer an answer to this question!</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; [PE]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; For quiet sounds, the nonlinearity is insignificant. The loudness<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the difference tone and other nonlinear combinational tones<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; increases<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; *nonlinearly* (surprise) and generally in an accelerating manner as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; one increases the loudness of the original sound.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [YA]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  If that were so, it [the beat] would be inaudible.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [PE]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; It *is* inaudible (that is, there is no heard pitch corresponding<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the difference frequency) under conditions of exactly linear<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; response.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [YA]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;  ... which don&apos;t exist except as an approximation good at very low<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; power ...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; [PE]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Low loudness.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;   * Why is the distinction important here?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because the nonlinearity of the response happens in the ear, so what<br/>&gt; matters is how loud the sound is when it reaches the ear, not its<br/>&gt; power at the source.</p><p>This is true.   But I did not specify power &quot;at the source&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; [PE]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Bill Sethares, in his book, claims that combinational<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; tones are irrelevant to music and tuning because they are too quiet<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; to matter at normal music listening levels.

His book is all about<br/>&gt; consonance/dissonance and making music with *inharmonic spectra* and<br/>&gt; he completely dismisses the relevance of combinational tones to this<br/>&gt; enterprise.</p><p>He&apos;s welcome to disagree.  But are there good reasons for such a<br/>dismissal?  For example, can one demonstrate that combinational<br/>tones will never be salient enough to produce an impression of<br/>harmonic spectra?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; [PE]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; The exact frequency ratios, over the entire spectrum of audible<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; absolute frequencies, that are just large enough to permit two sine<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; waves to be resolved separately, have been measured in a large body<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; of experiments on human subjects. They vary greatly over the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; spectrum, but never become narrower than a whole tone (nearing it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; only an an optimal &quot;middle&quot; absolute frequency range). Thankfully,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; we<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; rarely use a single pair of pure sine waves to make music!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;    * So what you&apos;re saying implies that at all audible frequencies,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;       we cannot hear a pair of pure sine waves differing only by a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;       semitone as such - our ears require that we hear them as an<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;       AM<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;       tone at their average frequency?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We may hear aspects of both -- there&apos;s a &quot;roughness&quot; region between<br/>&gt; the &quot;beating&quot; region and the &quot;two tones&quot; region where the sound is a<br/>&gt; confused compromise between the two latter sensations. But the<br/>&gt; beating tone at the average frequency doesn&apos;t completely disappear<br/>&gt; from our hearing until the sine waves differ by at least a whole tone.</p><p>OK, let me write a little essay to test my understanding.<br/>Audible frequencies are conventionally 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.<br/>&quot;Middle&quot; is presumably around the middle of the *log* frequency<br/>range; say roughly from 440 Hz to 1,760 Hz for convenience.<br/>That would be a range of two octaves upwards from A above<br/>middle C.  (You may have more exact data.)</p><p>In this range we can reliably distinguish at best a whole tone<br/>difference, never less.  At a semitone difference, we may be in<br/>the roughness region where we confusedly hear *both* a<br/>semitone difference and a beating average note.  So, for<br/>example, playing the 880 Hz A together with A# above it means<br/>we would be able to distinguish the two notes some of the time,<br/>while the rest of the time we hear a strongly beating A+.

So I&apos;ve heard the &quot;roughness&quot; region quite clearly.</p><p>Playing the 880 Hz A and the B above it together still produces<br/>a roughly beating note; while playing A and C together produces<br/>(surprise!) a distinct third, with both notes clear and no<br/>noticeable beating.</p><p>Now I know why my attempts, many years ago, to produce<br/>harmonious music using chords built on seconds were MUCH<br/>less successful than using chords built on thirds or fourths!<br/>I guess it has to be hard to follow separate melodic voices<br/>when you can&apos;t even decide what notes they are singing or<br/>playing ... :-)</p><p>This humble worm may yet hope to achieve enlightenment<br/>at thy feet, O Guru!</p><p>&gt; &gt;       How much does this difference vary from one individual to<br/>&gt; &gt;       another, according to the &quot;large body of experiments&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not a lot, and the interval in question is called the &quot;critical<br/>&gt; band&quot; -- one of the most familiar, and hence well-documented,<br/>&gt; entities in psychoacoustics.</p><p>Paul, telling me that something is well-documented is not<br/>very much help, I fear.

Are you sure this is the kind of &apos;limit&apos; you want?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I didn&apos;t say so; you merely inferred it, wrongly, as it happens.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Awful. I am sorry.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry we misunderstood each other.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; At what point do<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; these high-numbered ratios leave the realm of musical relevance?<br/>&gt;Of<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; course it depends on the tuning system, but my point is that a<br/>&gt;prime<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; limit alone doesn&apos;t seem to be capable of unambiguously<br/>&gt;corresponding<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; or not corresponding, in general, to an arbitrary tuning system,<br/>&gt;via<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; any aural or even mathematical test, as long as one recognizes a<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; finite uncertainty in hearing intervals (or even merely the<br/>&gt;minimal<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; uncertainty allowed by the classical uncertainty<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; principle . . .) . . . The exceptions would seem to be cases<br/>&gt;where an<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; odd, integer, or other &quot;finitary&quot; limit is ascertained first, and<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; then the prime limit is simply taken as the largest prime not<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; exceeding that limit.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t disagree, but I was focussing on what prime limits<br/>&gt;&gt; I can distinguish, rather than on what overall (odd) limit I<br/>&gt;&gt; can distinguish.  I agree that fixing the latter sets an upper<br/>&gt;&gt; bound on the former.  In an earlier message, I found that<br/>&gt;&gt; a listener&apos;s odd limit must lie somewhere near or below 101,<br/>&gt;&gt; on the unproven assumption that the frequency resolution of<br/>&gt;&gt; that listener&apos;s hearing is at best 2 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;For 101-limit, wouldn&apos;t it have to be considerably better than 0.17<br/>&gt;cents based on your earlier message? Because if you can&apos;t distinguish<br/>&gt;a &apos;dissonant&apos; or &apos;non-just&apos; region *in between* the interval 100/99<br/>&gt;and the interval 101/100, then it&apos;s pretty hard to claim that you&apos;re<br/>&gt;hearing these two ratios per se as the JI intervals they represent,<br/>&gt;rather than simply hearing them as similar but slightly different<br/>&gt;intervals.</p><p>Yep.  Maybe we&apos;d have to divide the resolution required<br/>by three or four, in order to have a band of dissonance of<br/>reasonable width; along the lines of the following sketch:<br/> --::|::--::|::----::|::--::|::---------::|::--::|::---::|::--<br/>which divides the audio frequency spectrum up by equal<br/>ticks, with values - for the sensation of dissonance, : for<br/>the sensation of a JI interval, and | for the exact location<br/>of the JI ratio.

This is<br/>exactly analogous to trying to tune in distant short-wave<br/>radio stations in a crowded band.  Mind you, it might still<br/>be possible to say - as people completely untrained in<br/>music do say - &quot;that sounds sweet&quot; - without ever being<br/>able to put numbers to the sound, even when the band of<br/>dissonance is vanishingly small.</p><p>Still, I take your argument to imply that the frequency<br/>resolution of the listener&apos;s hearing for 101-limit, would<br/>have to be *at least a bit* (not considerably) better<br/>than 0.17 cents.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; [PE]<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Bill Sethares, in his book, claims that combinational<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tones are irrelevant to music and tuning because they are too<br/>&gt;quiet<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to matter at normal music listening levels. I think he needs<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to &quot;temper&quot; this assessment somewhat.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   * They&apos;d make ALL the difference if you&apos;re trying to achieve<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      a totally inharmonic spectrum!<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; Bill Sethares seems to disagree. His book is all about<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; consonance/dissonance and making music with *inharmonic spectra*<br/>&gt;and<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; he completely dismisses the relevance of combinational tones to<br/>&gt;this<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; enterprise.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; He&apos;s welcome to disagree.  But are there good reasons for such a<br/>&gt;&gt; dismissal?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You&apos;ll have to take that up with him! He&apos;s here . . . I don&apos;t happen<br/>&gt;to think he&apos;s right on this . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; For example, can one demonstrate that combinational<br/>&gt;&gt; tones will never be salient enough to produce an impression of<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic spectra?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, interestingly when one attempts to do so using an inharmonic<br/>&gt;series of partials, a different subjective sensation (that<br/>&gt;of &apos;virtual pitch&apos;), which tries to comprimise out the<br/>&gt;inharmonicities and derive a most plausible fundamental frequency for<br/>&gt;the complex, seems to dominate over the combinational tones.
