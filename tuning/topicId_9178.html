Thanks for the appropriate terminology, Paul.</p><p>Jerry, I suspect you&apos;re operating under a serious misconception here. Our<br/>ears and brains are remarkably oblivious to phase, and the kind of &quot;lining<br/>up&quot; you&apos;re talking about, even if you could come up with a mathematical<br/>definition of such a thing (there&apos;s a challenge), would have virtually no<br/>effect on any audible characteristics of the sound. So I believe it&apos;s<br/>meaningless to say that the ear does anything like what you describe above.<br/>I&apos;m not sure of the source of your misconception, but it reminds me of<br/>Robert Asmussen&apos;s web page:<br/><a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/Studio/rproj_swss/tuning/tuning.htm">http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/Studio/rproj_swss/tuning/tuning.htm</a>. Here he<br/>makes the error of picturing all tones as sine waves (a very unmusical<br/>timbre); that makes &quot;lining up&quot; easy to define, but leads to the false<br/>conclusion that the consonance of simple ratios is somehow enhanced when<br/>this lining up is done correctly. Though framed as a computer music project,<br/>Asmussen probably never carried out a comparison with different phases; if<br/>he did, he surely would have heard no differences.</p><p>It may sound like I&apos;m actually supporting your point, Jerry, because if you<br/>don&apos;t hear a difference, it would seem that the ear must be &quot;lining things<br/>up&quot; so that no difference arises. But it is simpler, and more in keeping<br/>with how we understand hearing, to assume that there is no difference<br/>because we are essentially picking up only the frequencies, and not the<br/>relative phases of the different frequencies, in the sounds we hear.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

A few cents<br/>variation<br/>&gt;&gt; around 5:4 is really the best you could hope for from a human vocalist.</p><p>Jerry wrote,</p><p>&gt;I suspect the reason for the &quot;security&quot; on the low third was the &quot; quiet<br/>&gt;rumbling&quot; of the fundamental assuring me that I was close. With the high<br/>&gt;third, no such rumbling occurs, therefore there is likely more flexibility<br/>&gt;as to the optimum placement.</p><p>So Jerry, what is your current theory as to what defines the &quot;locking&quot; or<br/>the &quot;optimum placement&quot; of the high third?</p><p>&gt;However, a phenomenally fine children&apos;s choir of about 70 voices<br/>&gt;often agreed on very high thirds.</p><p>Note the word &quot;very&quot;. Are you giving up your notion that the high third (in<br/>the specific context of the major triad) is an interval of fixed size, like<br/>the low third which we all agree is 5:4?</p></div><h3>Paul H.

I think this is from 6:5 (definitely this<br/>&gt;time) to 9:7.  But, if you do the Fourier transform over a longer<br/>&gt;period of time, you see a constant but blurred trace.  The most<br/>&gt;intense frequencies in that blur are colored differently, and fairly<br/>&gt;consistently correspond to a 5:4.  Which is what we would have<br/>&gt;expected.  Looks like the ear does a similar thing.</p><p>I don&apos;t think the ear does a similar thing.</p><p>&gt;The &quot;blurring&quot; would presumably be interpreted by the ear similarly to<br/>&gt;vibrato.</p><p>Naah, I definitely heard Jerry&apos;s low third example as spending most of its<br/>time within a few cents of 5:4, with occasional rapid departures and<br/>returns. I did not hear it as a consistent 5:4, &quot;blurred&quot; or otherwise. Of<br/>course, my ear may be performing Fourier transforms over different periods<br/>than yours, maybe as a result of too much time figuring out fast guitar<br/>licks :)</p><p>&gt;However, it is qualitatively different.  It looks like a<br/>&gt;fractal trace, rather than a sine wave.  I&apos;d like to hotwire a synth<br/>&gt;to emulate this.  Maybe over the weekend.  It must come from some<br/>&gt;feature of the vocal chords</p><p>I think it happens as a result of the feedback interaction between the vocal<br/>chords and the ear, mediated by the brain, in the effort to sing a steady<br/>pitch. You can see a similar effect by trying to hold a heavy object up at a<br/>certain level, lining it up with a reference point in the background. The<br/>vocal chords alone would do no such thing. A better singer than Jerry or I,<br/>say Sheila Chandra, is able to sing a steady tone with almost none of these<br/>effects, due to the level of perfection she has achieved in this feedback<br/>mechanism.</p></div>
