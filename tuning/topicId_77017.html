I<br/>myself am more interested in reaching people who have little or no knowledge of<br/>tunings; and that&apos;s not so hard to do.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That would be most people, far as I know.&nbsp; Most people I know who have the privilage of hearing micro-tonal music either jump at how micro-tonal sounds less consonant or less like 12TET.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; And those who just simply yell at it for lack of consonance...can obviously be disproved...the chief example being the extra 2 blue  notes in the 9 note blues scale....to some extent you can argue &quot;well...BB King does some micro-tonal&quot;....and of course the fact many micro-tonal scales emulate Just Intonation more accurately than 12TET. :-)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The trick, in my mind, seems to be convincing them that micro-tonal is to &quot;tonal&quot; as calculus is to algebra...often they both can arrive at the same answer, but the prior can also solve more complex problems and enable more complex engineering.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time...if micro-tonal continues to be a<br/> &quot;lost art&quot;...it will still inspire the minds who push its boundaries and push themselves to digest it&apos;s huge palette of different sounds and different degrees consonance.&nbsp; All of which is beautiful for your mind, and virtually anyone elses, ultimately.</p><p>-----------------<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another note, my best scale was composed about 40% by math and 60% by ear around a<br/>melody playing in my head...I say best because about half the &quot;never<br/>heard micro-tonal&quot; listeners found it desirable and, at the same time,<br/>it has 9 notes (as a subset of 41TET) that can be formed into chords<br/>almost as easily and with as in 12-TET, yet has ratios very unlike just<br/>intonation.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only other scale system I&apos;ve seen so far that also<br/>&quot;purposefully disobeys&quot; JI and acheives a similar result is &quot;Lucy<br/>Tuning&quot; based scales.&nbsp; That and William Sethares&apos; system of making any scale consonant by manipulating the timbre of instruments to match it.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although, somehow, I knew one artist on TIS who even said Sethares&apos; work (a brilliant 10TET guitar piece, in my opinion called &quot;Ten Fingers&quot;) sounded bad, and he thought my scale was at least &quot;ok, but not very good&quot;.&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; My point is math helps, but there are other emotional factors in making scales that put in a major factor in on top of that problem.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; ---------------</p></div>
