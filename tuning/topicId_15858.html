The most famous<br/>example is the Kornerup system, which has the same scale sizes as<br/>Yasser&apos;s proposed evolution</p><p>2, 5, 7, 12, 19, 31, 50, 81 . . .</p><p>but maintains the same (noble) generator throughout.</p><p>What if we allow three step sizes, and posit the following evolution<br/>rules:</p><p>siz(n-2) + siz(n-1) + siz(n) = siz(n+1)?

You, and also Carl Lumma<br/>who once asked what a 2-d generalization of MOS might be like. I came<br/>up with the idea while waking up Friday morning, when I discovered<br/>that the pattern of very important scale sizes 3, 7, 12, 22, 41 is a<br/>Tribonacci-like sequence, and one thought led to another . . . but I<br/>haven&apos;t had a chance to get to my office and get on Matlab or Excel<br/>yet.</p></div>
