If you were to encode it at, say, 16k or 20k (24k at most) instead of<br/>128k, then those of us with modem connections (probably 95% or more) would be able to listen to<br/>it.  As it stands, only those with cable, DSL, ISDN, or corporate/university connections will<br/>be able to use it.  MP3 music doesn&apos;t seem to suffer quite as badly from low bit rate as Real<br/>Audio does.  It gets a little grainy and has some noticeable artifacts, but it tends to lose<br/>low end instead of high end like Real Audio does.  IMO, that gives better sound for music,<br/>whereas Real seems better for speech.</p><p>--<br/>David J.
