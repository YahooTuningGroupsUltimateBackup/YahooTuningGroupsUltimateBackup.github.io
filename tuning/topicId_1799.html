In this case as well as that of Thailand, it is not suprising to<br/>find &quot;large&quot; deviations from theoretical equal temperament. The<br/>tolerance for melodic &quot;errors&quot; is rather wide -- try tuning several<br/>octaves of 5-tET or 7-tET by ear and see how well you do. Use inharmonic<br/>timbres, and remember that many cultures enjoy a &quot;dissonant&quot; octave<br/>(sharp or flat) which preserves the identity of the two notes. The point<br/>is that the concept is one of equal intervals; like Aristoxenus&apos;<br/>concept, this doesn&apos;t have to be accompanied by specifying<br/>string-lengths as roots of 2 or whatever; satisfying the musician&apos;s ear<br/>is all that counts, and with only 5 or 7 notes per octave, even 30-cent<br/>deviations from true equality can be understood. 5 and 7 are most<br/>frequent because they approximate fourths and fifths as well as the<br/>octave; these are the only rational intervals that can have any meaning<br/>in a melodic context with inharmonic timbres, and again 30-cent<br/>deviations can be accepted in this context.</p><p>With long-duration JI simultaneities on harmonic timbres, you can<br/>actually hear 1 or 2 cent deviations from ideal ratios, so the standards<br/>for tuning deviations must be quite different. ET in the west evolved<br/>from tunings which better approximated just intervals, but 16-cent<br/>deviations are now accepted. These 16-cent deviations are more<br/>disturbing to the rational intervals, and more damaging to the equality<br/>of the tuning if rectified, than the 30-cent deviations are in the<br/>systems above.</p><p>While African xylophones have inharmonic timbres, their voices do not,<br/>and I&apos;ve heard just 7-limit intervals in African ensemble singing that<br/>sounded non-Western enough for me to surmise that this was their<br/>traditional form of singing (unlike the stuff Paul Simon made famous). I<br/>don&apos;t have any recordings to back this up, though; anyone care to<br/>recommend any?</p></div>
