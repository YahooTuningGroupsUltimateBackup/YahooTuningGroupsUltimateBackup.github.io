RgVeda?</p><p> As a result, they have not only been<br/>&gt;     critical of performance but on occasion, have attempted to impose<br/>&gt;     their notions on performers.  The most obvious instance of this has<br/>&gt;     been the case of the harmonium which has been criticised by numerous<br/>&gt;     scholars [4] and was banned from All India Radio for perhaps twenty<br/>&gt;     years because its basically tempered set of twelve semitones were<br/>&gt;     thought to dull the acute sense of perception implicit in the 22<br/>&gt;     /shruti/ (microtone) octave described by the most revered Sanskrit<br/>&gt;     musical treatises (e.g., /Naatyashaastra/ and /Sa.ngiita<br/>&gt;     Ratnaakara/).  The harmonium has been used as an accompaniment by<br/>&gt;     some of the leading singers of this century and still continues to<br/>&gt;     be used in this capacity.  The issue that emerges from this is<br/>&gt;     whether or not those who presume to know what Indian classical music<br/>&gt;     ought to be have the right to censor musical practice.<br/>&gt;         It is not at all surprising that attitudes of this kind caused a<br/>&gt;     rift between theorists and practising musicians.  If the breach is<br/>&gt;     to be repaired, theory must follow practice -- not attempt to<br/>&gt;     dictate the course of practice;  if, however, theoreticians can<br/>&gt;     create one or more theories which are meaningful to the performers,<br/>&gt;     they will undoubtably feed back into practice, but this must be left<br/>&gt;     to the discretion of the performer/composers, and not dictated by<br/>&gt;     the theoreticians.<br/>Yes but this then again assumes some restrictive metaphor that &quot;nothing new<br/>under the sun&quot;<br/>mentality ~ Yes &quot;tradition&quot;  if that means respect and discretion for the<br/>trad raags. One would&apos;nt want to break any &quot;backs&quot; while rendering the raag.<br/>but what i am interested in is interpretation and redefinition. I love<br/>Hindustaani Classical but refuse in some cross-cultural fervor to replace<br/>Raga Yaman Kalyan with Whipping Post in some slavish pecking order.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;          In the classical music of North India<br/>&gt;     there is no need for equal temperament, since the factors which lead<br/>&gt;     to this -- changing harmonies and the system of keys -- do not<br/>&gt;     apply.<br/>Amen to that. or should i say OM to that :-)</p><p>  Electronic analysis has confirmed<br/>&gt;     that there is variation in intonation from one musician to another,<br/>&gt;     as well as for a single musician during the course of a performance.<br/>&gt;<br/>Seven Sa&apos;s for seven brothers?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;         In the introductory chapter we have already suggested that the<br/>&gt;     /shruti/, which was the basis of distinction between two parent<br/>&gt;     scales in ancient India, had certainly lost its original<br/>&gt;     significance by the 17th century.  In modern times certian<br/>&gt;     musicologists and musicians still attempt to apply the old<br/>&gt;     twenty-two /shruti/ system to present-day music, while others go so<br/>&gt;     far as to assert that the present-day gamut can only be explained in<br/>&gt;     terms of forty-nine or even sixty-six different intervals.  The fact<br/>&gt;     remains that /shrutis/ are no longer functional, that is they are<br/>&gt;     not a primary basis of distinction between /raags/.</p><p>Sruti = microinterval each note having it&apos;s three manifestations 22*3<br/>i count 66 notes at least to the duple.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     ====================================================================<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     (pp. 70-71)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>  In two<br/>&gt;     dimensions the bottom of the valley appears to be a state of minimum<br/>&gt;     potential energy; in three dimensions, however, it is seen that the<br/>&gt;     bottom of the valley is itself sloping towards a lower valley.  The<br/>&gt;     incline is less steep in the valley than on the slopes, thus the<br/>&gt;     kinetic energy, which can be correlated with the dynamic function of<br/>&gt;     the notes, is lower in the valley than on the slopes.  Would a<br/>&gt;     musician necessarily choose the point of lowest kinetic energy when<br/>&gt;     he wishes to convey suspense, anticipation or tension?  It has been<br/>&gt;     noted that the leading note (Ni) is often sharper in ascent than in<br/>&gt;     descent.  Is not this sharpening of the Ni a subconscious device to<br/>&gt;     increase its dynamic value so that it more urgently demands<br/>&gt;     resolution on the tonic (Sa)?<br/>You Betcha</p></div>
