The system tray has like three icons in<br/>&gt; it, so i dont think thats the problem. I&apos;ve noticed with video streaming<br/>&gt; that say, NASA TV comes in fine, but if i try to get BBC tv, it comes in at<br/>&gt; 29kps or so, which is not enough for a frame rate. I assume this is the<br/>&gt; internet routing slowing down the packages, and perhaps this is a more<br/>&gt; common problem then something being wrong at either end itself?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; also speculating...</p><p>It&apos;s always a good idea to have as much memory as your operating system<br/>can handle.

A bit too loud but...I&apos;ve heard all the Niblock cds<br/>&gt; and been to a few of the winter solstice marathons<br/>&gt; but this evening was a bit different.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It started off with a tape of some festival<br/>&gt; with a lot of drums and gongs. Thomas Buckner<br/>&gt; sang but was totally drowned out by the guitars<br/>&gt; of Alan Licht and another un-identified guitarist<br/>&gt; with ebows. This was followed by more typical (yet<br/>&gt; a new path for Phill)<br/>&gt; drone pieces with just the guitarists bowing along.<br/>&gt; Really different than the recorded work I&apos;ve heard previously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After a big hurdy gurdy drone (no performers),<br/>&gt; Buckner returned to sing along with a 24 track recording<br/>&gt; of himself. Possibly the most amazing thing I&apos;ve heard from Phill yet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Followed by another hudy gurdy sort of piece (no performers).<br/>&gt; All this with projections of manual labor in China and Africa<br/>&gt; on a big screen behind the performers and another wall on the<br/>&gt; right with a projection that shows a phto that gradually<br/>&gt; mutates into the next photo.</p><p>and on Friday I heard Sasha Bogdanwitsch with another<br/>composer at St. Peters Episcopalian church<br/>on W.20th. Sasha sang with a string qt., and they also performed<br/>a string qt by him in ji. Stunning. I&apos;ll tell you folks more<br/>if I can find my program notes....</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
