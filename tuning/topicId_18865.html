My dad used to write true-life articles<br/>for sailing magazines. Here are two reviews of his work<br/>(hang in there friends, I _am_ going to tie this back<br/>to tuning, and you&apos;re going to love it):<br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/> Dear OFFSHORE,</p><p> I suppose arrogance insensitivity and stupidity<br/> are their own reward, in which case Jason Scott&apos;s<br/> cup must be running over. I have diligently<br/> followed all three of this stories, searching for<br/> more than the glimmer of sanity or common sense<br/> and have found little. His macho attitude leaves<br/> little room for any compassion for his real<br/> troubles. By the time he was done swaggering<br/> through a foreign country, abusing its customs,<br/> attitudes and advice I could only cheer for his<br/> difficulties, and sorely wished the pirates had<br/> got him.</p><p> Sincerely,<br/> Sarah E. Amyes</p><p> DEAR OFFSHORE:</p><p> A friend visiting your State brought me the May<br/> issue of your rag, and I read the article about<br/> &quot;piracy&quot; in Baja California, Mexico, with such<br/> disgust and hurt that I am barely able to write<br/> this: I would much prefer to deliver my comments<br/> to you and the writer in person, with physical<br/> emphasis.</p><p> You have not only lied about piracy in Mexico,<br/> which does not happen at all, but you have<br/> maligned the people of Baja California, including<br/> all of the villagers and humble fishermen who<br/> regularly welcome and aid visiting boaters. As I<br/> write this, l am thinking about the many incidents<br/> I have seen and experienced while cruising these<br/> waters; not only are boaters absolutely safe from<br/> harm from these gentle people, but they are always<br/> ready to lend a hand in protection from hazards.</p><p> I have cruised the area, and camped in Baja over<br/> many years. There is no place in the U.S. which is<br/> safer.</p><p> If this article is a sample of the accuracy of<br/> articles in your magazine, I hope you soon go<br/> bankrupt.</p><p> Walter Colby<br/> Baja Califonia, Mexico</p><p> Dear OFFSHORE,</p><p> A few words about Jason Scott: He battles savage<br/> pirates. He wheels and deals with the inscrutable<br/> Chinese. He endures lazy foreign crew members. He<br/> alienates his wife. He annoys the hell out of me.<br/> Have we heard the last of this pompous, racist<br/> braggart? Maybe you should run his articles under<br/> &quot;Adventures in Boating Stupidity.&quot; The only good<br/> that I can see in his &quot;adventures&quot; is that they<br/> keep him far away from New England. If the &quot;John<br/> Wayne&quot; of boating ever sails the &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; in<br/> this direction, let me know far in advance so can<br/> head for some safer harbor, like Nicaragua.</p><p> P. Bodine<br/> Medford, MA<br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>OK, me again -- now, each time a letter like this came<br/>in, the editors would pass them along to my Dad with<br/>a note that said &quot;Keep up the good work, Jas!&quot; or<br/>&quot;Jas -- Everytime we put your name on the cover,<br/>our newsstand sales go through the frigin roof!&quot; or<br/>&quot;Jas, You&apos;ve got the Midas Touch!&quot;</p><p>Now what do we know?</p><p>1. There is no such thing as bad publicity.<br/>2. The worst review is no review.</p><p>OK. Allegedly, The Rite of Spring provoked fistfights in the<br/>audience among people who disagreed on whether it was really<br/>art or was in fact an unbearable collection of candomly<br/>assembled screechy noises. Who cares if that Stravinsky<br/>story is true or not, the fact is that his music inspired<br/>great passion in people. Which is the very best thing<br/>you can do as an artist -- wake people up and turn them<br/>into real human beings. What I wouldn&apos;t give for the<br/>old days when the U.S Congressional Record described<br/>the rampaging fist-fights and free-for-alls that broke<br/>out among regularly among Senators and Representatives<br/>who really cared about the issues! Back then the word<br/>&apos;Honorable&apos; really meant something.</p><p>Now if Joseph hated Warren&apos;s music and everything it<br/>represents and felt so passionately about it that he was<br/>willing to write a scathing treatise seething with venom and<br/>vitriol then that us the ABSOLUTELY BEST compliment he could<br/>pay. And a _real_ indicator of the quality, provocativeness<br/>and impact of Warren&apos;s work. What has Warren stirred up?<br/>Questions about the nature of art! Can a machine produce<br/>art? Is art threatened? Are algorithms meaningless? Is the<br/>creation of an algorithm an artistic event? Should we build<br/>robotic tanks and planes and send them into battle to kill<br/>people without involving a human decision in the loop? That<br/>is what we&apos;re really talking about!! Yes! An idiot genius<br/>friend of mine was working on this stupid Terminator cr_p at<br/>a military contractor he worked for. &quot;Isn&apos;t this neat,&quot; he<br/>told me, &quot;my design automatically guides the plane in and<br/>targets the weapons array. All the pilot has to do is<br/>confirm the launch! Cool huh?&quot; &quot;Look Travis you d-ckh-ad,<br/>what the h-ll is wrong with you? Have you lost your mind you<br/>demon? Do you think they are going to bother with a pilot?&quot;<br/>&quot;They would never do that!&quot; &quot;How can you be so smart and so<br/>d-mn naive? How many lines of code do they have to comment<br/>out in order to leave the pilot out of the loop?&quot; &quot;Um, one.&quot;<br/>&quot;And did they tell you to be sure to identify that line?&quot;<br/>&quot;Uh, actually my boss did bring that up.&quot; &quot;And what does<br/>that suggest to you?&quot; &quot;But they would never do that! That<br/>would be morally wrong. These weapons are strictly<br/>defensive! They would never do that.&quot; &quot;Travis my buddy, a<br/>corporation has no conscience, according to Thoreau who was<br/>right and you know it. And the government is the largest<br/>corporation in the world. Every day limits on its power are<br/>removed. It&apos;s nothing personal. It&apos;s not a conspiracy. It&apos;s<br/>just how power works. Please wake up.&quot; &quot;But they would never<br/>do that!&quot;</p><p>OK - see? This is 100% true (BTW, 6 years after that<br/>conversation was last week when I read in the Wall Street<br/>Journal that the new administration is going to go full<br/>throttle on pilotless weapons that make targeting decisions<br/>autonomously -- THIS IS WHERE ALGORITHMS HAVE BROUGHT US! So<br/>yes I agree with Joseph 100% -- Machines are terrifying<br/>things capable of great evil, when &apos;properly designed.&apos;</p><p>People nowadays have a real reason to be threatened<br/>by progress:</p><p> &quot;Why, just yesterday I heard that there is<br/>  going to be a concert of some newfangled tuning system!&quot;</p><p> &quot;Well I say what&apos;s wrong with the tunings we got? I heard<br/>  that music and it is from the devil!&quot;</p><p> &quot;You&apos;re right! It&apos;s communists and liberals that are doing<br/>  that garbage and they&apos;re paying for it with _our_ tax<br/>  dollars!&quot;</p><p>Hey you know what, I sympathize with these characters!<br/>Where is technology leading us? And why is _it_ leading<br/>_us_ instead of the reverse ways?</p><p>These are real issues regular, intelligent, reasonable<br/>people are dealing with in the real world.</p><p>One possible expression of that is to write a scathing<br/>review. And expression is art.</p><p>Scathing reviews are the best kind. People love them.<br/>Can relate to them. It whets their appetite. Excites,<br/>invigorates them. Arouses their curiosity. Provokes them.<br/>Inspires debate among their friends, supplying them with<br/>ready-made _arguments_ to agree with or tear apart.<br/>When the rabbinical spirit of friendly debate is awakened,<br/>we all win!</p><p>(Now, ad hominem arguments are puerile and should be<br/>avoided among ourselves of course, but that&apos;s not<br/>what we&apos;re talking about. We&apos;re talking about real<br/>issues here.)</p><p>So, I say let&apos;s realize this and enter into a mutual<br/>awareness -- a secret compact. When we hear that a fellow<br/>microtonalist is coming to town or we&apos;ve just gotten done<br/>with hearing a concert, let&apos;s go with the flow of what we<br/>experience. If we absolutely hated it (and certainly we can<br/>agree that there is lots to hate and lots to love about any<br/>kind of music), we should come to terms with that experience<br/>and tell everyone who will listen everything we hated about<br/>it! Write scathing letters to the editor of every newspaper,<br/>newsletter, magazine, journal and TV show with any sort of<br/>relevance. Explain in great detail and with elegant and<br/>beautiful vitriol our _real_ feelings. Hold nothing back.<br/>Hey, go ahead and throw in those ad hominem arguments.<br/>Question the composer&apos;s lifestyle choices and connect it<br/>through innuendo to his poor compositional talent. In no<br/>time at all, the concert halls will be packed with<br/>fist-fighting music haters and 21st century music will have<br/>caught fire, burning down everything in it&apos;s path,<br/>terrifying, inspiring, awakening the doleful slumber of the<br/>quiet desperation that guides the lives of our culture, our<br/>people, our country. Music, having lain dead for centuries,<br/>will enter a golden age of expression and beauty.<br/>Interconnect everything! Let the glass bead game begin!</p><p>&gt; I actually had a very pleasant conversation with Burt when I met<br/>&gt; him, and I would like to keep up good relations.</p><p>I&apos;ve only met Warren once -- at the first concert he gave<br/>upon returning from Australia (at the Sonic Arts Gallery --<br/>Monz, say hi to Jonathan &amp; Elizabeth for me) and he is a<br/>really nice guy who is very excited about what he does.<br/>I too have reservations about algorithmic composition<br/>usually but must admit I liked what I heard. Real talent and<br/>creativity can express itself in any system -- including<br/>the fabrication of algorithms and systems. Warren doesn&apos;t<br/>seem like the kind of guy to get offended by much, in<br/>my limited and brief exposure to him.</p><p>&gt; Speaking of which, is everyone aware that Google now searches news<br/>&gt; groups like rec.music.compose as well as the Tuning List??</p><p>Merde! This is NOT NOT NOT good. I do not like it one bit.<br/>Seriously, let&apos;s ask Yahoo if we can AVOID that by making<br/>the list private and then accepting one and all anyway.</p><p>&gt; Try a search on your own name, and you will probably come up with<br/>&gt; some Tuning List posts.</p><p>Well that&apos;s easy enough to get around now that we<br/>know, but still -- it may be too late for me already.</p><p>- Pedro<br/>(z h e p h)</p></div><h3><a id=18886 href="#18886">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/17/2001 8:46:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Pedro Montaigne&quot; &lt;xjscott@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_18865.html#18873">/tuning/topicId_18865.html#18873</a></p><p>&gt; Now what do we know?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.

In fact, we have tried some of your more<br/>&quot;extreme&quot; ideas on this very list.  However, rather than creating<br/>exciting commentary, people have gotten very upset and have taken<br/>everything personally.  In fact, Paul Erlich (hi Paul!) is one person<br/>enamored of a rather strong debating technique and, frankly, it<br/>doesn&apos;t bother me and some others... but there are STILL other people<br/>here who take everything personally and it frequently results in<br/>Paul having to make &quot;embarassing&quot; and somewhat unnecessary<br/>retractions.  (At least that&apos;s how *I* read it.)</p><p>&gt; Now if Joseph hated Warren&apos;s music and everything it<br/>&gt; represents and felt so passionately about it that he was<br/>&gt; willing to write a scathing treatise seething with venom and<br/>&gt; vitriol then that us the ABSOLUTELY BEST compliment he could<br/>&gt; pay.</p><p>Unfortunately, it didn&apos;t get me quite so &quot;stirred up.&quot;  In fact, it<br/>didn&apos;t get me &quot;stirred up&quot; at all, which was the crux of the<br/>problem...

However, as soon as the debate<br/>turns &quot;personal&quot; we have a problem and not only do people end up not<br/>learning anything, they also end up not talking to one another.  As I<br/>say, this has happened (still *IS* happening) on this very list.</p><p>At one point the New York Times had a policy that reviewers COULD NOT<br/>be composers.  I always thought it was a &quot;funny&quot; policy, until I had<br/>more experience.  It actually makes sense.

(At least that&apos;s how *I* read it.)</p><p>The crux of the matter is how a review or criticism is presented.<br/>I&apos;ve had the opportunity to, once again, have a long dialog with Paul<br/>*off-list* to straighten some things out, and virtually every point<br/>is in agreement -- in subject, but not necessarily in tone!</p><p>There is, it seems to me, a great deal of difference in the informal<br/>and interactive nature of these fora, and if the bulk of<br/>these &apos;conversations&apos; could have taken place in a bar or<br/>coffeehouse, where facial expressions, tone of voice, and very rapid<br/>give-and-take were present, I&apos;ll wager that 99% percent of the<br/>problems you perceive would disappear, or at the very least be dealt<br/>with quickly and far less rancor than is apparant on the list.</p><p>And every list has these cycles, save for (intelligently and<br/>humanely) moderated ones.</p><p>More importantly, the generation of a review or commentary for actual<br/>publication, be it in print or online, carries with it an entirely<br/>different set of responsibilities. You seem to be the kind of person<br/>who could very well write of a concert with a minimum of non-<br/>essential histrionics. As all good journalism probably should have,<br/>at least in this context.</p><p>If the progress in this particular realm (microtonal<br/>composition/performance) is to continue to grow, if this community is<br/>to *help* it grow, then it can certainly stand a healthy dose of<br/>objective evaluation. Even if you prefaced it with &quot;I&apos;m not a fan of<br/>algorhythmic composition&quot;, your bias would be clearly stated and then<br/>you could get on with how you reacted to the music. Knowing Warren,<br/>he would take careful and reasoned commentary with grace and<br/>appreciation; at least, that is the impression he has given me in the<br/>past.</p><p>The last thing that will encourage true growth is either silence or<br/>feel-good &quot;atta-boys&quot;. Phrased in a civil manner, couched in truth<br/>and personal reaction, an honest review could be an invaluable tool<br/>for evolution of the chosen art form.</p><p>I very frequently do not completely live up to these standards, and<br/>find on this list the postings of Margo Schulter to be exemplary<br/>examples of good, honest, caring intellectual give-and-take. Always<br/>willing to acknowledge helpful corrections, always happy to give<br/>credit where due, it is really a pleasure to read, in spite of the<br/>fact that the subject matter is not something I utilize!</p><p>&gt; At one point the New York Times had a policy that reviewers COULD<br/>NOT<br/>&gt; be composers.  I always thought it was a &quot;funny&quot; policy, until I<br/>had<br/>&gt; more experience.  It actually makes sense.  In other words, a<br/>&gt; reviewer should really be &quot;out of the game&quot; so that he can comment<br/>&gt; with impunity in any ways he wishes.</p><p>And we end up with reviewers who know absolutely nothing about<br/>entirely new territory, writing empty-headed nonsense (at times).<br/>Sure, to see how it might affect an entirely new set of<br/>ears/aesthetics, why not? But this shouldn&apos;t preclude knowledgeable<br/>reviewing. Hey, if I want to know what a micro- concert was like that<br/>I can&apos;t attend, I&apos;d sure like to hear about it from people on this<br/>list rather than Alex Ross of the New Yorker!</p><p>&gt; In *my* case, since I am still actively composing and looking for<br/>&gt; performances, I can&apos;t afford to alienate so many people, even<br/>though<br/>&gt; it might make for good and &quot;intellectually stimulating&quot; copy.</p><p>People with strong convictions in their art could certainly stand up<br/>to your views. What would they think if you artificially back-patted<br/>them and then later realized you couldn&apos;t stand their stuff?</p><p>Well, this is a small community and none of this is the end of the<br/>world, but I myself would look forward to yours, or any of the other<br/>list members, commentaries on concerts you might hear. NY and it&apos;s<br/>environs have a lot of activity, and if we can&apos;t get there it is nice<br/>to hear how it was...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=18900 href="#18900">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/17/2001 1:08:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JSZANTO@A... wrote:<br/>&gt; Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just to follow up on this, as Pedro spoke at length and very<br/>&gt; eloquently!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you very much, Jon, for your commentary....</p><p>&gt; More importantly, the generation of a review or commentary for<br/>actual publication, be it in print or online, carries with it an<br/>entirely different set of responsibilities. You seem to be the kind<br/>of person who could very well write of a concert with a minimum of<br/>non-essential histrionics. As all good journalism probably should<br/>have, at least in this context.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks, Jon, for the compliment.  Actually, the review is STILL<br/>AVAILABLE and will exist immortally until the world is distroyed in<br/>an anthrax attack or the existing (more than enough) 2000 atomic<br/>missiles are utilized...</p><p>A quick search on &quot;Warren Burt&quot; will reveal this irradicable gem and,<br/>in fact, it is Post # 15262.  It is now a TUNING LIST EXCLUSIVE and<br/>you can still read it in it&apos;s original form!  Thanks for the interest!</p><p>_________ ____ ___ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
