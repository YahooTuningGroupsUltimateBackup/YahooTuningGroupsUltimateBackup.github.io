I hadn&apos;t gone up to this<br/>level yet and what you say is true. I&apos;ll look into this one some more. It<br/>is an important feature of the eikosany that these diamonds could be placed<br/>on any of the 10 opposite pair of products. With the 4)8 CPS we would have<br/>35 pairs of Ogdoadic Diamonds. In the simpler Tetradic tone space, two<br/>tetradic diamonds on opposite functions of a Hexany will have tones in<br/>common. I still believe that this is the one of the most fruitful areas for<br/>those working in electronics. It goes into areas where us acoustic girls<br/>and boys are left behind.<br/>    Having worked with the eikosany for over 20 years let me say that its<br/>structural features are easily perceived in a short period of time. At this<br/>point a single tetrad has a certain &quot;meaning&quot; in the overall context as<br/>strong as tonality but not centered. It like a globe where once you know<br/>your way around any point works. In this case you have multidimensional<br/>cycles that our mind is much more comfortable than you could think.<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
