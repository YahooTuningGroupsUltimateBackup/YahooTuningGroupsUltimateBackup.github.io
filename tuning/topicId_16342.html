Or is there indeed something very precious that might be<br/>compromised or lost by applying this kind of JI label?</p><p>What might be compromised is the democracy of intervals, the axiom<br/>that each integer ratio and musical sonority counts.</p><p>Suppose, for example, we say that a traditional medieval Pythagorean<br/>tuning is &quot;JI&quot; under a &quot;harmonicity-based&quot; definition because the<br/>stable concords are indeed pure: 2:1, 3:2, 4:3 -- thus 2:3:4 or<br/>sometimes 3:4:6. If we want to get &quot;avant garde&quot; and treat 1:3:9 or<br/>1:6:9 as stable -- a possibility suggested by Jacobus of Liege around<br/>1325 when he includes 9:1 as a &quot;perfect concord&quot; -- those sonorities<br/>would be pure also.</p><p>However, what about such important sonorities as the 64:81:96 or<br/>54:64:81 or 27:32:48 or 18:27:32 or 64:81:108? These unstable but<br/>compatible sonorities are precious resources, coloristic and<br/>cadential, and they have integer ratios fitting with the integral<br/>structure of the tuning. To me, they are at once complex and &quot;in<br/>tune&quot;; they are at their &quot;correct&quot; size -- although by no means the<br/>only the pleasing or possible size.</p><p>Under a &quot;harmonicity-based&quot; JI definition, I might be in the position<br/>of saying, &quot;Yes, Pythagorean is a JI tuning because we can connect all<br/>the notes with pure ratios of 3:2, even though most of the intervals<br/>and sonorities are actually not in tune.&quot;</p><p>To me, this would be a kind of extraneous and invidious discrimination<br/>against intervals which should enjoy equally &quot;in tune&quot; status, albeit<br/>at different levels of complexity and stylistic &quot;concord/discord.&quot;</p><p>Similarly, how about a tuning combining pure 3:2&apos;s and 4:3&apos;s and<br/>2:3:4&apos;s with such &quot;modern&quot; integer-based sonorities as 28:33:42 or<br/>14:17:21? To me, the numbers and sounds don&apos;t have to be bound by<br/>tests of partials or harmonicity; they have their own beauty, and the<br/>integer-based viewpoint is part of the total art, just as irrational<br/>temperaments such as 29-tET have their own beauty and art.</p><p>One motivation for applying a label such as RI is to emphasize that<br/>I regard simple and complex intervals alike as &quot;in tune,&quot; all of them<br/>in their own ways.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that this viewpoint is a musical as well as<br/>mathematical one: intervals such as 32:27, 81:64, 27:16, and 16:9 are<br/>a constant reality in the sound and texture of my music, and I want to<br/>stay with definitions of what I am doing that affirm their dignity and<br/>&quot;in-tuneness.&quot; Curiously, Jacobus of Liege calls them compatible and<br/>&quot;consonant&quot; (_consona_) to various degrees of &quot;medial&quot; or &quot;imperfect&quot;<br/>concord, and I likewise call them &quot;in tune,&quot; although at the same time<br/>active and unstable (a dynamic virtue, not a vice or flaw); but some<br/>more &quot;modern&quot; views focus on their &quot;out-of-tuneness&quot; or<br/>&quot;inharmonicity,&quot; or &quot;nonjustness.&quot;</p><p>Such musicians as Prosdocimus say that a rightly intoned 81:64<br/>is &quot;fully perfected,&quot; striving to expand to a fifth, and this part of<br/>my everyday musical experience; this means to me that the interval is<br/>in tune, although not based on harmonics or locking-in partials. It<br/>also has a conceptual beauty as a member of the community of intervals<br/>arising from the integral powers of 3:2, and its musical and<br/>mathematical logic reinforce each other, engaging at once the ear and<br/>the intellect.</p><p>The debate may come down in large part to this: some of us see a<br/>continuum of intervals which may be approached using either<br/>integer-based or irrational ratios, typically producing somewhat<br/>different formal and musical results, but with either approach<br/>encompassing a spectrum of simple and complex intervals alike. The<br/>integer-based side of this approach is the RI kind of viewpoint -- or,<br/>even more expressively, Rational Continuum Intonation (RCI).</p><p>In contrast, others of us apparently seek to draw a contrast between<br/>&quot;JI&quot; based on primarily on intervals with pure _harmonicity_, in<br/>contrast to &quot;nonjust&quot; or &quot;tempered&quot; music with other types of<br/>intervals, whether integer-based or otherwise.</p><p>For an RI enthusiast, the JI dichotomy of just/nonjust seems an<br/>invidious distinction, a discriminatory measure imposed by some<br/>foreign power on an equal polity of simple and complex ratios and<br/>intervals -- although the &quot;JI-as-harmonicity&quot; exponent regards it<br/>simply as a recognition of a paramount sensory and musical reality.</p><p>For a JI-as-harmonicity enthusiast, the RI concept seems to blur the<br/>basic distinction between a just and a nonjust interval, contradicting<br/>musical experience -- although the RI exponent routinely experiences<br/>such intervals as 27:16 as musically natural, normal, and beautiful.</p><p>One important conclusion: the difference in viewpoints here may<br/>reflect very audible differences in musical styles as well as fine<br/>philosophical distinctions or mathematical niceties.</p><p>Either an integer-based Pythagorean tuning or an irrational<br/>temperament like 29-tET fits neo-Gothic music, because both approaches<br/>provide an attractive and stylistically right mixture of simple and<br/>complex intervals (the simple intervals like 3:2 and 4:3 being pure in<br/>Pythgorean and slightly impure in 29-tET, of course).</p><p>The main point may be the musical context: we have few stable and many<br/>unstable intervals, and complexity is in style and flower for the<br/>latter, whether based on integer or irrational mathematics.</p><p>In other styles, such as 16th-century European music, where more<br/>intervals are stable and stable concords play a more pervasive role in<br/>the texture, the &quot;harmonicity-JI&quot; paradigm may fit very nicely. The<br/>difference between these viewpoints -- medieval vs. Renaissance, or RI<br/>vs. JI today on this List -- is one of musical taste and context as<br/>well as mathematical philosophy.</p><p>In modern physics, novel terms are sometimes chosen precisely to avoid<br/>possible implications of more familiar terms that might be out of<br/>place.</p><p>Following this precedent, I am leaning toward the RI category as a<br/>description of integer-based music based on the &quot;in-tuneness&quot; of<br/>simple and complex ratios alike, and potentially including any integer<br/>ratio on the rational number line, often with a special delight in<br/>the lore of large ratios.</p><p>If one follows the principle of the philosopher Grice that one should<br/>strive to communicate as meaningfully and economically as possible,<br/>then RI might be the most communicative term for such music. This is<br/>not to repudiate a JI characterization, only to choose the term which<br/>may maximize light and minimize possibly unnecessary definitional<br/>friction or tension.</p><p>There is so much more to say, so many valuable contributions to<br/>respond to, including the engaging scales of Jacky Ligon, which he has<br/>described as RI.</p><p>If this thread marks the recognition of a new category of tuning, as<br/>well as chronicling a diversity of views on JI as an established<br/>category, then it may have served a creative purpose indeed.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=16353 href="#16353">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
