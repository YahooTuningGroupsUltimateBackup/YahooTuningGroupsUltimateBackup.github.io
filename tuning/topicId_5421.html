He put out a video demonstrating the wonders of his new<br/>&gt;fretting system.  He never said how it worked, but it wasn&apos;t that hard to<br/>&gt;figure out that he&apos;d just slid the nut forward a millimeter or two.</p><p>Yes, we had a discussion of the Buzz Feiten system here awhile back, and<br/>while it seems to be effective (my friend Harry Fleishman heard a side by<br/>side of several different types guitars with and without the Feiten system<br/>and said the difference was obvious) I have never quite understood why the<br/>nut should be higher from the first fret than the first fret is from the<br/>second. With a zero fret, what would the solution to the problem of<br/>differing pitch bends for different string to fret distances be? Wouldn&apos;t<br/>we need to consider where a player plays on average and just tune the<br/>bridge appropriately?</p><p>Judith Conrad:<br/>&gt;One can either have one string per note, as in an &apos;Unfretted clavichord&apos;,<br/>&gt;and this was really a late-eighteenth century invention, or one can have<br/>&gt;more than one string per note -- ergo &apos;fretted&apos;.</p><p>You mean &quot;more than one note per string&quot; I think. I have never seen the<br/>guts of a real clavichord in person, only schematics. I would love to play<br/>one. Does anyone know of any in the Denver area?</p><p>Finally, Chris Mohr of Denver ordered a microtonal button matrix thing<br/>from Starr Labs, and it is supposed to be delivered in the next week.<br/>I can&apos;t wait to play it. Chris is working on a huge project, a song cycle<br/>based on the mystical poems of many of the worlds great poets. Man, I hope<br/>that wasn&apos;t suppposed to be a secret and that I got it right.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret</a></p></div>
