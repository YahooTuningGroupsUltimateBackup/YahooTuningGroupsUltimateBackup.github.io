But, while you were away, Dave and Margo brought up the acoustic<br/>&gt; noble means because they seem very often to be extremely close to the &quot;most<br/>&gt; dissonant&quot; interval within a certain range. Dave and Margo have been<br/>&gt; discussing ways of altering the fifths in a Gothic application of<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning so that the thirds come out &quot;maximally dissonant&quot;. Hence<br/>&gt; an application of the acoustic noble means to scale generation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
