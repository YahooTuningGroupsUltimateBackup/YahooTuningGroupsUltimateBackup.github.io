At this time, I have a student (about 24) with a lot of talent,<br/>&gt; but he doesn&apos;t like blues, based on the noodly jam sessions he&apos;s gone<br/>&gt; to, and the blandness of Kenny Wayne Shepherd. There&apos;s a bit of humor<br/>&gt; here, as he&apos;s never even heard any of the greats, Howlin Wolf, etc, so<br/>&gt; I&apos;m going to see if he can be swayed in his rather limited opinion of<br/>&gt; this marvelous art form.</p><p>I was part of that thread too and could have just as well made the<br/>misinterpreted &apos;watered down&apos; remark. Its true that not ALL blues<br/>need be variable form, but the 12-bar I-IV-V canon played badly is,<br/>unfortunately, all too common.</p><p>I brought some charts to a jazz performance last week; Good Morning<br/>School Girl based on Sonny Boy Williamsons recording (which Johny Winter<br/>was actually quite faithful to), and Big Mama Thorntons 13-bar form of<br/>&apos;You Aint Nothin but a Hounddog&apos;. (I won&apos;t say that every chorus is 13<br/>bars in her recording, but theres quite a few that are).</p><p>We managed to make these interesting and unique tunes sound like bar<br/>band blues numbers, &apos;Rock Rewls!&apos;. For worse, or better, &apos;Hounddog&apos;<br/>(instrumental) got the best ovation of the night (and some of the<br/>other &apos;standards&apos; we played were pretty hot and over funk grooves rather<br/>than just swing).</p><p>&gt;     BTW, guitar fans should check out Metheny&apos;s new Live Trio album...I<br/>&gt; heard one disc, and was mighty impressed at the creativity, the chops,<br/>&gt; and the wide stylistic range.</p><p>I attended a performance on the tour and bought the double CD. Great<br/>show and the recording captures a lot of it. That Frippish number was<br/>played about 3/4 of the way through the show and chased a few of the<br/>patrons out.  To bring this back to microtonality, he played a<br/>fretless classical (was it also with doubled courses) on a number,<br/>and for some reason, his guitar synth playing sounds especially &apos;in<br/>the cracks&apos;.</p><p>I don&apos;t think jazz is dead, even when I&apos;m surrounded at sessions<br/>by &apos;bebop nazis&apos; (though I find that depressing... &apos;whats WRONG with me&apos;).<br/>Perhaps there is no single &apos;movement&apos; now, but that<br/>just means that jazz has become post-modernist like everything else.<br/>But there is still gobs of creative and different threads happenning.<br/>Steve Coleman for one is making new jazz that is also rooted<br/>in current black US culture. [Not that that is necessary, but a lot of<br/>good and not so good jazz being done these days has many more<br/>&apos;non-black US&apos; practitioners and influences. I have a feeling of<br/>mistrust when I feel like an art form is aboandoned by its creators].<br/>To bring this on topic, he is also beginning to get interested in all<br/>sorts of &apos;musical numerology&apos; which lead at times into tuning theory.<br/>Theres also a whole movement of &apos;fusion&apos; with Eastern European and<br/>Balkan influences (Paradox Trio, Tiny Bell Trio).</p><p>Mr Beardsley seems to be in the heart of it and<br/>I can understand the resentment that many in the &apos;living breathing<br/>jazz community&apos; are feeling at this &apos;jazzumentary&apos;.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
