So I did. Again, the octaves are about 7 cents flat, which means I had to use Scala for retuning the MIDI file. So if you think you can hear some tones changing their pitches just before completely disappearing, then that&apos;s not just what you think, it actually IS there.

I would encourage you to make something more out of it. Surprisingly, it sounds to me a bit like if I made it :-D (this happens very rarely even in the cases where both of us use the same tuning, which I think my recent superpelog piece proves well).</p></div>
