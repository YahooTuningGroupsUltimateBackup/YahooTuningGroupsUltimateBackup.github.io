First, let us consider the following model of using a hanged weight to tune a string made from an available tensile material:</p><p>|________ L _______<br/>      O                           O|<br/>                                       |<br/>                                       |<br/>                                      W</p><p>where the vibrating lenght of the string (L) is the portion between the two bridges, producing a certain frequency due to pull of W.</p><p>If we agree that W is equal to T in every way, the equation for calculating the tension was:</p><p>        4 F^2 L^2 Mu<br/>W=  __________</p><p>                 n^1</p><p>And the relationship for Mu (mass per unit lenght) was:</p><p>Mu = Pi * r^2 * rho.</p><p>By increasing the weight, we would be introducing a longitudinal perturbation to the tensile medium, which would result in an increase in frequency as demonstrated below:</p><p>=========<br/>=========<br/>=========<br/>=========<br/>=========<br/>        |<br/>        |<br/>        |<br/>       W</p><p>=========<br/>        =<br/>=========<br/>        =<br/>=========<br/>        =<br/>=========<br/>        =<br/>=========<br/>        |<br/>        |<br/>        |<br/>      2W</p><p>This demonstration assumes a uniform microscopic modular structure of the string viewed from the side, where the additional force, by drawing the modules apart, results in a lower Mu within the vibrating L.</p><p>In other words, an increase in tension directly causes the density within the given lenght to decrease, where, after reaching a certain limit, the Mu of a certain cross-sectional area will rapidly drop to zero and the string will snap.</p><p>Of course, the strenght of the material chosen (measured by the relationship for Mu) is a determining factor in this.</p><p>However, aside from this longitudinal perturbation, the hammers of the piano introduce an additional force known as the transversal perturbation. This effect is demonstrated below:</p><p>                                               xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br/>                             xxxxxxxxxx                           xxxxxxxxxxx<br/>                  xxxxxx                                                                xxxxxx<br/>       xxxxxx                                                                                      xxxxxx<br/>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br/>       xxxxxx                                                                                      xxxxxx<br/>                  xxxxxx                                                                xxxxxx<br/>                             xxxxxxxxxx                           xxxxxxxxxxx<br/>                                               xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>The illustration attempts to show that a string struct by a hammer will travel a short distance in either direction throughout the course of its oscillation. This effect is the magnitude, in other words, the amplitude of sound.</p><p>A first order approximation that disregards this effect would require that W, L, F, and Mu are all taken as constant throughout.</p><p>A second order approximation might lead one to assume W and Mu to be constant while the lenght varies inversely proportional to F, so that fff (forte fortessimo) hammer-strikes would lower the frequency.</p><p>In contrast, a complete model would require that all the variables change when the transversal perturbation is introduced into the medium. This means, that the string not only elastically extends in lenght during oscillation, but also, that the additional stretch lowers its density considerably.</p><p>An auditory experiment shows that fff hammer-strikes differ from a ppp hammer-strikes by a barely perceptible amount. The louder passages are thus heard to be higher in frequency, leading us to believe that the density decreases much more rapidly than lenght increases for oscillations with great amplitude.</p><p>If a given piano string is calculated to break at about 2W (in other words, 2T), a vectoral equivalance shows that:</p><p>(2T)^2 = T^2 + X^2</p><p>where T is the horizontal vector of tension, while X is the perpendicular (transversal) vector of tension required to break the string.</p><p>Thus,</p><p>(2T)^2 = T^2 + X^2</p><p>4(T^2) = T^2 + X^2</p><p>X^2 = 3 (T^2)</p><p>X= sqr {3 (T^2)}</p><p>X= (sqr 3) * (sqr T^2)</p><p>X= (sqr 3) T</p><p>X= 1.73 T</p><p>All of this means, that a hammer strike delivering an additional force equivalent to 0.73 T will break the string just as 2W does.</p><p>The angle of oscillation can thus be calculated:</p><p>    2T<br/>          / |<br/>        /   |<br/>      /     |    X<br/>    /       |<br/>  /        V<br/>-----------------&gt;<br/>           T</p><p>cos alpha = 1/2 = 60 degrees.</p><p>It can be seen that the string must vibrate with an angle of 60 degrees in reference to its (horizontal) plane before it can be made to snap.</p><p>However, this calculation assumes a homogenous structure and does not consider the uniform density of the material, dislocation of its atomic components and metal fatigue, all of which would eventually cause the string to break after just a few degrees of displacement.</p><p>In short, there is much more to strings than just the radii.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan Yarman</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Cris Forster<br/>  To: Tuning<br/>  Sent: 30 May&imath;s 2005 Pazartesi 19:02<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Aspects of restringing and retuning pianos</p><p>  Dear Fellow Builders,</p><p>  Good morning!</p><p>  I am offering the following article to those of you who may have<br/>  been wondering why the science of restringing pianos and the art<br/>  of retuning pianos is not a well-defined subject.</p><p>  &gt;From a technical perspective, the most difficult aspect of<br/>  restringing a piano is to understand the interlinked relationships<br/>  between  variables.  An introduction into this subject requires<br/>  three initial steps.</p><p>  (1)  Consider the following equation for calculating the tension of a<br/>  string:</p><p>  T = 4 * F^2 * L^2 * Pi * r^2 * rho</p><p>  where F is the frequency, in Hz;  L is the vibrating length of the<br/>  string, in meters;  r is the radius of the string, in meters;  and rho is<br/>  the mass density of the stringing material, in kg/m^3.</p><p>  This equation includes the following subequation:</p><p>  M/u.l. = Pi * r^2 * rho</p><p>  where M/u.l. is the mass per unit length of the string.</p><p>  For a quality piano, typical properties for middle G, or the G above<br/>  middle C, are</p><p>  F = 392.0 Hz<br/>  L = .489 meter  (19.25 in.)<br/>  r = .000483 meter  (.019 in.)<br/>  rho = 7833 kg/m^3 for spring steel [ .00073299 (lbf * s^2)/in^4 ]</p><p>  so that,</p><p>  M/u.l. = 3.1416 * .000483^2 * 7833 = .00574 kg/m</p><p>  and,</p><p>  T = 4 * 392.0^2 *.489^2 * 3.1416 * .000483^2 * 7833</p><p>  T = 843.8 Newtons  (189.3 pounds-force)</p><p>  (2)  To calculate a string&apos;s break strength, we must know the<br/>  tensile strength of the stringing material.  For spring steel, tensile<br/>  strength values range between 300,000 psi -- 400,000 psi, or<br/>  between 2.07 * 10^9 Pa -- 2.76 * 10^9 Pa. (Pa short for Pascals.)<br/>  An average value of 350,000 psi is equivalent to 2.41 * 10^9 Pa.</p><p>  First, calculate the string&apos;s cross-sectional surface area:</p><p>  S = Pi * r^2 = 3.1416 * .000483^2 = 7.329 * 10^-7 sq. m</p><p>  Now calculate the string&apos;s break strength by multiplying the<br/>  surface area times the average tensile strength of spring steel:</p><p>  Break Strength = (7.329 * 10^-7) * (2.41 * 10^9) = 1766.3 N</p><p>  Finally, determine what percentage 843.8 N is of 1766.3 N.  Divide<br/>  the smaller number by the larger, and multiply the quotient by 100:</p><p>  (843.8 / 1766.3) * 100 = 48</p><p>  Since most piano strings are tensioned between 40% and 50% of<br/>  their break strength, 48% is within the desired range.</p><p>  (3)  Finally, we must evaluate the inharmonicity of this string.</p><p>  The quote below is from my manuscript _Musical Mathematics: A<br/>  Practice in the Mathematics of Tuning Instruments and Analyzing<br/>  Scales_.</p><p>  To read the Table of Contents of this work, please logon at:</p><p>  <a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/musical_mathematics.htm">http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/musical_mathematics.htm</a></p><p>  Here is an excerpt from the beginning of Chapter 4:</p><p>  ******************************</p><p>  &quot;On any given string, a true harmonic series could only occur if the<br/>  string were perfectly flexible.  Since all strings exhibit varying<br/>  degrees of _stiffness_, the flexible string model no longer applies.<br/>  Stiffness causes the modes to vibrate at frequencies considerably<br/>  higher than suggested by Equation 4.1.  For this reason, we call<br/>  the sharp mode frequencies of stiff strings inharmonic frequencies<br/>  [ IF(n) ], a term that refers to non-integer multiples of the<br/>  fundamental frequency.&quot;</p><p>  ******************************</p><p>  To calculate the IF(n) requires a dimensionless stiffness<br/>  parameter ( J ).  There are two different types of equations for J:<br/>  one includes a tension ( T ) variable;  the other includes a<br/>  frequency variable ( F ).  In the former equation, J is directly<br/>  proportional to D^4, where D is the diameter of the string.  In the<br/>  latter equation, J is directly proportional to D^2.  Therefore, as the<br/>  diameter or the thickness of the string increases, the stiffness<br/>  parameter increases as well.  This tells us that for thin strings the<br/>  upper modes of vibration are more in tune than for thick strings.<br/>  For the above-calculated G-392.0 Hz string, J = .0002088.  If we<br/>  substitute this value into an equation for IF(n), and if we then<br/>  calculate the inharmonic frequency of the second mode of<br/>  vibration, the result is IF(2) = 784.49 cps.  In a perfectly flexible<br/>  string, F(2) = 784.00 cps.  Consequently, the second mode<br/>  sounds 1.083 cents sharp.  Similarly, the third mode sounds 2.888<br/>  cents sharp, and the fourth mode sounds 5.415 cents sharp.</p><p>  (( _Musical Mathematics_ contains detailed equations for<br/>  calculating J and IF(n).

Since the tones of these scales (with the<br/>  exception of the &quot;octave&quot;) are tuned to irrational frequency ratios,<br/>  and since in stiff strings the upper modes of vibration sound<br/>  irrational frequencies, there exists no instantly recognizable<br/>  conflict.</p><p>  However, when conventionally strung pianos are tuned in just<br/>  intonation, where all the tones are tuned to rational frequency<br/>  ratios, intonational problems instantly become audible.</p><p>  To read a description of my Just Keys piano, which I restrung<br/>  three times and retuned four times in 1990, please logon at:</p><p>  <a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/instruments.htm">http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org/instruments.htm</a> &gt; Just Keys</p><p>  In pianos, the bass and treble bridges are glued to the<br/>  soundboard.  Since they are not moveable, one has no choice in<br/>  determining the vibrating lengths of piano strings.  Therefore, once<br/>  a scale has been decided, the diameters of strings constitute the<br/>  most critical physical variables in restringing pianos.</p><p>  To summarize:</p><p>  (1) Tension is directly proportional to r^2.  (2) Break Strength is<br/>  directly proportional to r^2.  (3) J is either directly proportional to<br/>  D^4, or to D^2.</p><p>  The science of restringing and the art of retuning pianos are<br/>  critically determined by either the radii or the diameters of strings.</p><p>  OK.  Now, let&apos;s open the lid of this B&ouml;sendorfer Imperial,<br/>  take out all the strings, and get it right the first time!</p><p>  Sincerely,</p><p>  I-am-an-instrument-in-need-of-tuning</p><p>  AKA</p><p>  Cris Forster, Music Director<br/>  <a href="http://www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org">www.Chrysalis-Foundation.org</a></p></div>
