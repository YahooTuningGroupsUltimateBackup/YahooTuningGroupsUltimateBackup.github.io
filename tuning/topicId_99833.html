At Berklee it<br/>was referred to as &apos;chord scales&apos; but the basic idea is to see each<br/>chord on a &apos;lead sheet&apos; as having its own scale. Sometimes, these<br/>scales actually turn out to be related modes and you are just playing<br/>&quot;in the key of&quot;. But in the compositions of a lot of the post-fusion<br/>guys (based on the theories established by Bill Evans, Wayne Shorter,<br/>George Russel), you will sometimes have chords that result in new scales every measure. A lot of this music also ises modes of the<br/> melodic minor. At Berklee they were common enough to have names</p><p>1 2 b3 4 5 6 7     melodic minor<br/>1 b2 b3 4 5 6 b7   dorianb2<br/>1 2 3 #4 #5 6 7    lydian #5<br/>1 2 3 #4 5 6 b7    lydian b7<br/>1 2 3 4 5 b6 b7    mixolydian b7<br/>1 2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7  locrian natural 2<br/>1 b2 #2 &quot;3&quot; #4 #5/b13 b7 altered dominant</p><p>Perhaps the names came from George Russel. Altered dominant is the<br/>&apos;tritone flip&apos; of lydian b7, note the renaming of the diminshed<br/>fourth to its functional/aural equivalent in 12ET. Cool stuff like<br/>this doesn&apos;t work so well in most things other than 12, which is why<br/>some on the list look at comman pumps etc, to find the new puns that<br/>are out there.</p><p>Romantic classical music prototyped all this stuff under different<br/>names. Post-70&apos;s jazzers have likely bled it dry!</p></div>
