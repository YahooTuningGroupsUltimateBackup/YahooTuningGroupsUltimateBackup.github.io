Several times.<br/>&gt;You can see a perspective drawing of one if you look in Beauty in<br/>&gt;the Beast&apos;s enhanced CD files. Open up the article I wrote for<br/>&gt;Computer Music Journal called &quot;Tuning at the Crossroads.&quot; I&apos;ve tried<br/>&gt;to build one of these keyboards three times in my life. And I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;never had the money and assistance to complete it. There are other<br/>&gt;versions, but they look unwieldy to me, like typewriter keys. I can&apos;t<br/>&gt;imagine using typewriter keys to perform music. Anyway, a generalized<br/>&gt;multiphonic keyboard is the way it should be done. Lacking that, I<br/>&gt;have to use the keyboards I have here, which means you use two or<br/>&gt;three of them, and tune them in various ways, mark them with stickers<br/>&gt;and try to remember what key will make what pitch. Perhaps middle C<br/>&gt;will be the only right-on pitch. All other keys on the various<br/>&gt;keyboards will be redefined. It might take three octaves of keyboard<br/>&gt;to make what you&apos;d expect to be one octave.</p><p>-C.</p></div><h3><a id=46186 href="#46186">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2003 1:27:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; All;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was reading <a href="http://wendycarlos.com">wendycarlos.com</a>, and it&apos;s really come a long<br/>&gt; way since the early days.

This is about 3/2<br/>the width of  the Bosanquet and Carlos keys.  They are also ~1.06<br/>inches long in the y-axis direction, or about 2/3 the length of the<br/>Carlos keys.  So the surface area is comparable, but as I explain<br/>below, the difficulty in utilizing all of that surface area is what<br/>makes the Bosanquet and Carlos keyboard less efficient and thereby<br/>more difficult to play.</p><p>&gt; While I&apos;ve never played Carlos&apos; keyboard and have *very* limited<br/>&gt; experience with Wilson&apos;s, Michael Zarkey and I agree that the<br/>&gt; ability to access a key over a range of positions closer or<br/>&gt; farther from the player is a good thing.

Go to a<br/>piano and play an E-flat major triad in root position (with either<br/>hand).  The 3rd finger depresses the narrowest part of the G key,<br/>cramming it down in between the black keys.  This is more difficult<br/>than playing a C or E major triad on the piano, since using this<br/>portion of the key requires the player to be extremely accurate in<br/>the lateral finger placement so as not to press either black key by<br/>accident.  Erv realized that since 50% of the surface area of the<br/>Bosanquet (and Carlos) keyboards is located between higher-level<br/>adjacent keys, players would be likely to avoid using this difficult<br/>portion whenever possible; for example, imagine where you would put<br/>your thumb.  Surface area that is not often used is wasted space.</p><p>Regardless of the shape of the keys, the technique required for<br/>playing a two-dimensional keyboard involves making adjustments in the<br/>curvature of the fingers in order to depress the desired keys, a<br/>technique that has been used for many, many years by accordionists<br/>who play button keyboards (for either or both the right and left<br/>hands).  It&apos;s a somewhat different technique from what pianists are<br/>accustomed to, but it&apos;s not something radically new, just an<br/>inevitable part of what&apos;s required to play a new, 2-dimensional<br/>keyboard.</p><p>&gt; Maybe, however, Wilson&apos;s design suggests alternate fingerings.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t want to make the mistake of pushing piano technique on<br/>&gt; a new keyboard.</p><p>Alternate fingerings may involve crossing the thumb under to play the<br/>middle note of a microtonal triad or, if the tuning permits, may<br/>involve using duplicate keys that sound the same pitch.

The specific reason for doing this was that, upon<br/>depressing a key, the player would be able to tell by the angle of<br/>the portion of the key surface that is in contact with the finger<br/>whether the finger is centered on the key or closer to one edge (and<br/>approximately how close).</p><p>I elaborated on many of the details in an earlier posting:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39407">/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39407</a></p><p>We put a lot of thought into that keyboard, and after having used it<br/>for many years, I can&apos;t think of a single thing that we should have<br/>done differently (except perhaps giving it a 6-octave range).</p><p>&gt; Glissandi are cool, but<br/>&gt; they don&apos;t play that much of a role in my music.</p><p>Maybe that would change if you wrote something for the harp or the<br/>bell tree.  ;-)  Some techniques are so natural for certain<br/>instruments that they come to be regarded almost as defining<br/>characteristics of those instruments.  Perhaps glissandi are<br/>infrequently employed in piano music because they are a bit rough on<br/>the hands.  A microtonal glissando just might be one of those<br/>features that could popularize alternative-tuning synthesizers.

The tuning would be<br/>1/4 comma mean tone, so that for instance B# major is not the same as<br/>C major.  ... &gt;&gt;</p><p>The Fokker keyboard is different in that the pitch ascends by a major<br/>second (5 degrees of 31-ET) moving rightward along any row of keys,<br/>with all keys being the same size and shape so that they may be<br/>arranged in a two-dimensional grid.  You would encounter an upper<br/>octave of your starting tone only after moving rightward (or<br/>leftward) 31 keys.  Keys for tones an octave apart are therefore in<br/>different rows (the upper octave being two rows farther from the<br/>player).

Conventional pianists learn to play major scales 24<br/>different ways (12 ways with each hand, once for each of 12 keys),<br/>likewise for each minor scale (harmonic &amp; melodic versions) and for<br/>each inversion of each chord.  With the Fokker keyboard you need to<br/>learn each scale or chord only twice (once for each hand) to be able<br/>to play it in 31 different keys.  The keyboard also permits a player<br/>to transpose music at sight with ease.</p><p>The Bosanquet generalized keyboard is similar to the Fokker keyboard<br/>in that it also has homogeneous fingering patterns and tones rising<br/>by major seconds in its lateral rows.  Apart from the size and shape<br/>of the keys, it differs from the Fokker keyboard in three important<br/>ways:</p><p>1)  The rows are arranged in reverse order, so that the octave of any<br/>key is located two rows closer to the player.</p><p>2)  The rows are slanted (rising to the right) so that any two keys<br/>an octave apart are laterally aligned.</p><p>3)  It was designed for (and implemented) on instruments with<br/>multiple-tuning capability (even in 1875!), whereas the Fokker<br/>keyboard was intended only for 31-ET.  It will accommodate any tuning<br/>in which the tones may be arranged in a single sequence or circle of<br/>fifths, which would include the meantone temperament (or any of its<br/>variants).</p><p>This is a diagram of the Bosanquet geometry as it was used on the<br/>Scalatron (here labeled for 31-ET):</p><p><a href="/tuning-">/tuning-</a><br/>math/files/secor/kbds/KBScal31.gif</p><p>The naturals and sharps resemble a conventional 7-white-5-black<br/>arrangement.

Such a property is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;crucial to piano technique, anyway.  Fingers aren&apos;t all the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;same length.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;Rectangular keys help here, since keys from adjacent ranks don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;cut keys from the current rank short.  For example, on Carlos&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;keybord...<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/carlos-keyboard.jpg">http://lumma.org/tuning/carlos-keyboard.jpg</a><br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;...we can play C-E-G with fingers 1-3-5, with our middle finger<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;in a more natural position, since D# and E# do not cut E short.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Here&apos;s what Erv Wilson observed about why the Bosanquet (and thus<br/>&gt; &gt;also the Carlos) designs do not use the space efficiently.  Go to<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt;piano and play an E-flat major triad in root position (with either<br/>&gt; &gt;hand).  The 3rd finger depresses the narrowest part of the G key,<br/>&gt; &gt;cramming it down in between the black keys.  This is more<br/>difficult<br/>&gt; &gt;than playing a C or E major triad on the piano, since using this<br/>&gt; &gt;portion of the key requires the player to be extremely accurate in<br/>&gt; &gt;the lateral finger placement so as not to press either black key<br/>by<br/>&gt; &gt;accident.  Erv realized that since 50% of the surface area of the<br/>&gt; &gt;Bosanquet (and Carlos) keyboards is located between higher-level<br/>&gt; &gt;adjacent keys, players would be likely to avoid using this<br/>difficult<br/>&gt; &gt;portion whenever possible;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s room to make the keys wider than 1/2&quot; if we want, without<br/>&gt; the octaves exceeding the width of octaves on a piano.</p><p>But only if you use something like Erv Wilson&apos;s hexagons and then<br/>either:<br/>1) Make the keys shorter along the Y-axis (as Erv did); or<br/>2) Retain the ~1.5-inch key length, which both increases the key size<br/>(desirable) and elongates the keyboard in the Y-direction<br/>(undesirable, since it increases the center-to-center distance<br/>between keys in that direction).</p><p>But if you think otherwise, you&apos;ll have to make a drawing to convince<br/>me.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; convinced the the space between the keys isn&apos;t useful.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;for example, imagine where you would put your thumb.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My thumb&apos;s &apos;contact patch&apos; is no wider than those of my other<br/>&gt; fingers.</p><p>But on a 2-dimensional keyboard you would have to be careful to<br/>orient your thumb at the proper angle to get between those keys.<br/>I&apos;ve always found it inconvenient to get my fingers between the black<br/>keys.   My 2nd and 3rd fingers are about 20 mm wide at the base of<br/>the fingernail, which is a bit more than 1/2-inch, so I&apos;m quite happy<br/>that squeezing between keys is eliminated on the GK Scalatron<br/>keyboard.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Regardless of the shape of the keys, the technique required for<br/>&gt; &gt;playing a two-dimensional keyboard involves making adjustments in<br/>&gt; &gt;the curvature of the fingers in order to depress the desired keys,<br/>&gt; &gt;a technique that has been used for many, many years by<br/>&gt; &gt;accordionists who play button keyboards (for either or both the<br/>&gt; &gt;right and left hands).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, the demands of the left hand are very different.</p><p>Yes, the buttons are very close together, and it takes more practice<br/>to play fast passages cleanly than for the right hand (unless the<br/>latter has passages that involve squeezing between black keys).  One<br/>thing that helps considerably (particularly with my free-bass<br/>Moschino-system instrument) is that the fingering patterns are the<br/>same in every key, which greatly reduces the amount of practice over<br/>what would be required with a heterogeneous arrangement of buttons.<br/>(Gene, take note!)</p><p>If I seem to be contradicting myself by advocating a left-hand button<br/>system that involves squeezing my fingers between the buttons, let me<br/>quickly point out that this is only because I know of no good<br/>alternative.  In a situation where it is not practical to use the<br/>thumb (due to the position of the hand imposed by the wrist strap),<br/>small buttons are the only way to keep everything reasonably within<br/>reach.</p><p>&gt; But RH<br/>&gt; button-accordion technique interests me greatly!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I know we&apos;ve discussed this before, but I can&apos;t find it now!<br/>&gt; How do you finger C-Eb-G in root position on your keyboard?</p><p>Same fingers as C-E-G, except that the middle finger is bent more.<br/>But perhaps this is not what you were thinking of; see this message,<br/>where I describe how to play a major triad in a schismic temperament:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39446">/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39446</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Maybe, however, Wilson&apos;s design suggests alternate fingerings.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I don&apos;t want to make the mistake of pushing piano technique on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; a new keyboard.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Alternate fingerings may involve crossing the thumb under to play<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;middle note of a microtonal triad or, if the tuning permits, may<br/>&gt; &gt;involve using duplicate keys that sound the same pitch.  Either of<br/>&gt; &gt;these alleviate the problem posed by shorter keys without having<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt;resort to using narrower keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Janko keyboard provides the best fingerings I&apos;ve ever seen, but<br/>&gt; it does this by way of duplicate pitches on different ranks, so<br/>&gt; that the hand litterally fits into chords.</p><p>On the GK Scalatron, 12, 17, and 19-tone tunings are every bit as<br/>good as what you describe, because the duplicate keys are within easy<br/>reach.  A 22-tone tuning is a little more complicated, but only<br/>because the tonal relationships are so different, but the key<br/>locations for 5-limit triads in 22 happen to be very thumb-friendly.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; I&apos;m at a loss to explain the emphasis on glissandi.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;It&apos;s just an observation, not an emphasis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OTOH, Martin Braun might be interested!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;On the Scalatron generalized keyboard the glissando is simplified<br/>by<br/>&gt; &gt;the fact that the keys were made with convex rather than flat<br/>&gt; &gt;surfaces.  The specific reason for doing this was that, upon<br/>&gt; &gt;depressing a key, the player would be able to tell by the angle of<br/>&gt; &gt;the portion of the key surface that is in contact with the finger<br/>&gt; &gt;whether the finger is centered on the key or closer to one edge<br/>(and<br/>&gt; &gt;approximately how close).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I elaborated on many of the details in an earlier posting:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39407">/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39407</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;We put a lot of thought into that keyboard, and after having used<br/>&gt; &gt;it for many years, I can&apos;t think of a single thing that we should<br/>&gt; &gt;have done differently (except perhaps giving it a 6-octave range).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wait, I&apos;ve got one: You Shouldn&apos;t Have Stopped Making It!</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t have any say in the decision.  :-(</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; I suspect the 3rd dimensiion helps with locating and moving<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; around the keyboard -- thoughts on that?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The GK Scalatron keys are all in a single plane (another factor<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt;simplifies the glissando), and I have never felt that this<br/>presented<br/>&gt; &gt;any problem with establishing one&apos;s orientation.

Load at least 12 meantone<br/>style scales (in 31tet) into presets, with the chain of fifths<br/>starting from some extreme such as Cx through A, and going from<br/>there, loading the next most similar scale, such as Fx-D, then B#-G,<br/>E#-C, A#-F, D#-Bb, G#-Eb, C#-Ab, F#-Db, B-Gb, E-Cb, A-Fb, etc.  That<br/>should be enough for some purposes, but people have invented names<br/>enough for 31.</p><p>Divide the range of the midi controller pedal into enough segments,<br/>and use it to shift across the range of your preset scales.  A<br/>movement from one segment to another retunes a single step of the<br/>scale by the 31st root of 2, in a cycle of fifths.  You probably<br/>need a visual readout to know which one you&apos;re on.  Or program a<br/>midi pedalboard to do the same, with discrete control.  Then change<br/>C# to Db at will, as long as you&apos;ve already changed G# to Ab.</p><p>This is more limited than a generalized keyboard, because you only<br/>have 12 tones at a time, and always in the meantone paradigm.  So<br/>you can&apos;t do a stack of two augmented seconds (e.g., Bb-C#-Dx), or a<br/>single increment of 31tet, or a variety of other nonsense.  However,<br/>such a solution may have satisfied Vicentino&apos;s intended customers,<br/>who were mostly interested in modulating in an orderly fashion while<br/>retaining the virtues of meantone.  I think that&apos;s what they<br/>wanted, and I think they failed because of technical limitations<br/>(despite their craftmanship), and performance difficulties (despite<br/>their virtuosity).  But since split accidentals were so consistently<br/>popular, we might have been able to sell a pedal scale-shifting<br/>mechanism adapted to the old meantone keyboard.</p><p>However, I understand that 31tet is bigger than meantone, and has<br/>its own literature.  I am too old to learn another keyboard.  If I<br/>were 20, I&apos;d try to play Lippold Haken&apos;s Continuum Fingerboard, a<br/>non discrete solution.  I would sew threads on the surface so I<br/>could feel the steps of 31-equal.  The handshapes are kind of sort<br/>of reminiscent of playing in F# on the black keys.  I confess to an<br/>opinion that a small uncertainty of intonation is an important<br/>attention getter in music.  The listeners are engaged to help the<br/>performer or singer, since they know where the notes should go as<br/>well.  Compare Asian string instruments with their deep frets and<br/>bridges, developed in a partnership with the languages, where<br/>intonation is phonemic.

Then one could quite cheaply add midi in his basement,<br/>&gt; hook it up to the synth(s) of choice, and be running!</p><p>Here&apos;s the home page of the Veetronix website:</p><p><a href="http://www.veetronix.com/index.html">http://www.veetronix.com/index.html</a></p><p>I&apos;m certain that this is the company that made the GK Scalatron key<br/>switches.  The shorter of the two gray switches in the picture look<br/>just the switch used in the Scalatron.  The one labeled &quot;06&quot; on this<br/>page looks like the best candidate for a GK keyboard (due to 2<br/>characteristics mentioned: &quot;lower cost&quot; and &quot;momentary&quot;):</p><p><a href="http://www.veetronix.com/page5.html">http://www.veetronix.com/page5.html</a></p><p>I&apos;ll have to look at one of the key switches on my instrument to see<br/>if there is a part number on it.  (There is even a provision for<br/>illuminating the switches, so it would be possible to have all key<br/>tops white or transparent and have illuminated patterns that would<br/>change with the tuning.)</p><p>The biggest expense in making a generalized keyboard is 1) the cost<br/>of the switches, and 2) getting a mold made for the keytops.  I<br/>probably should contact them to see if they still have the Scalatron<br/>mold and, if so, ask them to hang on to it for the sake of any<br/>microtonalists who might want to build their own.  It looks like they<br/>still have all of the stock colors for keytops available that were<br/>used on the Scalatron (black, white, red, aqua, and green):</p><p><a href="http://www.veetronix.com/page7.html">http://www.veetronix.com/page7.html</a></p><p>Assuming that they have a mold, it&apos;s not very expensive to have them<br/>make as many keycaps as you need in whatever color you want.</p><p>The switches would need to be mounted in a rigid panel provided with<br/>holes of the desired size in the proper spacing.  A metal panel<br/>(probably aluminum, but possibly steel -- one more thing that I need<br/>to check) was used for the Scalatron.  This was covered with contact<br/>paper having a simulated wood grain.  A punch press was used to make<br/>the holes, but a do-it-yourselfer could purchase a greenlee<br/>(spelling?) punch of the proper size (which would be slower, but<br/>clean and accurate).  Mount this panel in a cabinet so that it slopes<br/>upward at a 17-degree angle, moving away from the player.</p><p>That covers only the physical construction.  The do-it-yourselfer<br/>would then have to figure out how to add the electronics to make a<br/>midi controller with programmable pitch bending.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=46385 href="#46385">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>8/11/2003 1:57:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jeff Olliff&quot; &lt;jolliff@d...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; However, I understand that 31tet is bigger than meantone,</p><p>bigger? in what sense?</p></div><h3><a id=46507 href="#46507">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2003 7:21:16 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_46176.html#46281">/tuning/topicId_46176.html#46281</a></p><p>&gt; But they *do* learn.
