Mindful of our recent discussions about John<br/>  Harrison using logs to determine frequency-size relations<br/>  for bells, I took logs of both variables and plotted them.</p><p>  With the assumption that the measurement for A is wrongly<br/>  transcribed, and should instead have been 277 mm, all the<br/>  frequencies are very nearly proportional to the inverse<br/>  square of the length.  The fit of the data is extremely good,<br/>  as can be seen by the coefficient of determination being<br/>  almost 1.</p><p>  Interestingly, the last post in Tom&apos;s page has Dave Chapman<br/>  mentioning this exact law, which is useful confirmation.</p><p>  If you&apos;d like to make yourself a set of wind chimes, note that<br/>  each chime should be suspended at about two-ninths the way<br/>  from the end.  (More exactly, so the length is 4.55 times the<br/>  distance of the suspension point from the end.)  There are<br/>  recipes on the page for constructing two sets of chimes, one<br/>  an octave higher, from (US) standard 10-foot lengths of<br/>  3/4-inch copper pipe.  As we&apos;ve been all-metric in Oz for<br/>  decades, I&apos;m not sure what the standard lengths are, tho we<br/>  do use 19mm copper pipe, very nearly 3/4&quot;.</p><p>  Spreadsheet attached, in Excel 2000 format.</p><p>  Regards,<br/>  Yahya</p></div>
