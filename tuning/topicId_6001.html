But for the absolute placement, I simply try for least average<br/>deviation from 12-tET.  I do take a weighted average, considering the<br/>relative volumes of the notes sounding, so that louder notes drift less.</p><p>Let me illustrate with a concrete example, the classic &quot;comma pump&quot;<br/>sequence, I-vi-ii-V-I.  Assume all notes have equal volume.  The<br/>following charts how to tune JI relative to 12-tET:</p><p>                     Absolute       Centered<br/>                       shift          shift<br/>                      (cents) *      (cents)<br/>                     --------       --------<br/>   C major (I)<br/>     C                  0.00          +3.91<br/>     E                -13.69          -9.78<br/>     G                 +1.96          +5.87<br/>   A minor (vi)<br/>     A                  0.00          -5.87<br/>     C                +15.65          +9.78<br/>     E                 +1.96          -3.91<br/>   D minor (ii)<br/>     D                  0.00          -5.87<br/>     F                +15.65          +9.78<br/>     A                 +1.96          -3.91<br/>   G major (V)<br/>     G                  0.00          +3.91<br/>     B                -13.69          -9.78<br/>     D                 +1.96          +5.87<br/>   C major (I)<br/>     C                  0.00          +3.91<br/>     E                -13.69          -9.78<br/>     G                 +1.96          +5.87</p><p>*There could easily be disagreement about which notes should be retuned<br/>for &quot;absolute&quot; tuning; this is one example.  No such ambiguity exists<br/>for centered shift.</p><p>This simple technique, while ugly from a theoretical point of view,<br/>nicely finesses the Pythagorean comma, while doing its best to center<br/>the tuning around syntonic comma shifts.</p><p>Whether the &quot;ideal&quot; drift is calculated by this method or another, in<br/>actual sequences further consideration should be given to reduce<br/>the jerking around of the tunings of continuously sounding notes (as<br/>other notes, and the underlying harmony, modulate).  This kind of<br/>optimization is very difficult in anything but a program (or human)<br/>which has access to an entire sequence; in other words, it is difficult<br/>to do in real-time playing.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=6028 href="#6028">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/9/1999 8:21:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 385.6]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My view is that works of classical music operate on a sort<br/>&gt; of medium-term pitch memory (of which perfect pitch would<br/>&gt; be the long-term analogy) and so when the music returns to<br/>&gt; the home key, the musical effect is lost unless the final<br/>&gt; pitch is quite close to the original pitch. There are works<br/>&gt; of Mozart which would drift downward by almost half an<br/>&gt; octave if strict JI were adhered to in all comma-dependent<br/>&gt; progressions (including, but not limited to, modulations)<br/>&gt; and that drift would certainly destroy the feeling of &quot;return,&quot;<br/>&gt; as well as a host of other pitch-memory dependent features<br/>&gt; on shorter scales.</p><p>I just found an article yesterday in _Music Theory Spectrum_<br/>that might shed some interesting light on this question.<br/>Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t make a copy of it, so I don&apos;t yet<br/>have the citation.  It was a relatively recent issue,<br/>from within the last few years.</p><p>It describes some formal aspects of a Schubert quartet<br/>(I believe it was _Death and the Maiden_), and places<br/>great emphasis on how scrupulous adherence to a 5-limit<br/>JI intonation in a performance of the piece would bring<br/>out tonal/formal strategies implemented by Schubert that<br/>otherwise would not be as clearly disclosed.</p><p>Perhaps someone else has access to the article and can respond<br/>in more detail.  I&apos;m very interested in how a JI performance<br/>of this piece would deal with the intonational drift<br/>mentioned by Paul.</p><p>BTW, do any of you keep up with the _Journal of Music Theory_?<br/>The latest issue (or at least the latest one *I&apos;ve* seen:<br/>vol 42 # 2, Fall 1998) is entirely devoted to papers<br/>elaborating neo-Riemannian theory.  It seems that the<br/>12-eq guys are appropriating &apos;our&apos; lattice diagrams to<br/>explain their own theories of 12-tET pitch-class sets.<br/>Some of their diagrams look very similar indeed to the<br/>triangular 3-D 7-limit lattices made by Pauls E. &amp; H. et al.</p><p>One of the articles (altho this particular one has no<br/>diagrams, but lots of mathematical formulae) is by Steven<br/>Soderberg, who was an occasional contributor to this List<br/>about a year ago.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
