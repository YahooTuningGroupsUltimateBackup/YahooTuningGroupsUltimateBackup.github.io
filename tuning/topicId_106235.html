The reduced mapping is [&lt;2 4 5 10|, &lt;0 -7 -3 -37|], so -7 25/24 generators make a 3/2, 1\2 (&quot;a half octave&quot;) minus 3 generators a 5/4, and -37 generators a 7/4 (again, octaves ignored).<br/>Hence, 7/6 consists of -37 - (-7) = -30 generators, or 10 5/4s, since 10 * (1\2 - 3 generators) = -30 generators and some octaves. ;)</p><p>Btw., are you using Graham&apos;s temperament finder?
