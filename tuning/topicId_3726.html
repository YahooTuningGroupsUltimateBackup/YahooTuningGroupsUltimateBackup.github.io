There are attractors<br/>&gt;that are &quot;close to&quot; their embedded period one orbits in the sense that the<br/>&gt;chaos is a chaotic variation around the period one. The usual method of<br/>&gt;chaos control requires only small perturbations of some parameter (chord<br/>&gt;tightness?) to switch between the embedded periodic orbits. Of course this<br/>&gt;is just speculation, but the fact that at least one study has found<br/>&gt;a strange attractor in a human vowel vocalization,</p><p>Can you point me to this study?</p><p>&gt;and the fact that<br/>&gt;controlling chaos is quite easy leads me to wonder about the possibility.</p><p>Do you think we are agreeing or offering two distinct possibilities? I<br/>honestly can&apos;t tell, but it seems like we might be saying exactly the same<br/>thing.</p></div>
