If the electronic signal that produced the darken area is connected to an audio amplifier - speaker we reproduce the constant sound of the triad (during one second). I gave this explanation because in my preceding message I wrote that &quot;the three wave response gives a completely dark area and no information.&quot;</p><p> Now you say that:  &lt; &quot;Well, that doesn&apos;t make sense - if there was no wave response, there &lt; would be no &lt;sound.&quot; The dark area contains data rather than visual information. Actually, the dark area contains compacted printed waves which are unavailable for the eyes. Since there are a lot of wave peaks in that area, like hundreds of needles, most of these peaks are converted to marks. On each graph I sent you I sent mark combinations to show either chaotic tempered responses or aesthetic Piagui marks.&lt; I don&apos;t understand your math. Can you frame it in terms of just intervals, i.e.      &lt; rational number, fractional relationships here? I&apos;m not sure what you mean.                                                                        Here you are: (9/8) (1/2) (2)(1/4) = 1,26134462288, (1/2) and (1/4) are exponents.This tone frequency is supported by cell # 205 of the progression: It is the third tone of Piagui II and Piagui III scales and made up by (K)(3) (P), where (3) is an exponent. Besides, the position of 1,26134462288 in the progression follows the expected position for Piagui II and III major scales.&lt; Your entire basis for calling it perfect is that the wave is slightly&lt; closer to periodic. The wave of C major is NOT fully periodic, as it&lt; would have to be in rational multiple relationships to be periodic.The wave of C Major is perfectly periodic. I sent you its response and measured the periodicity and stability of all triads during thirty minutes. &lt; My biggest problem with the scale is that the fifths that are better&lt; are only better by 2 cents, which is indistinguishable. The fifths&lt; that are worse, though, are flatter by 6 cents, which is very&lt; distinguishable.Until you give the total amount of indistinguishable and distinguishable cents in both scales Piagui and equal tempered, your incomplete report has no sense. It is time to know the truth in both sides. I know that truth, however I prefer that another person that is not involved in the subject do it.&iquest;Did you ever added the total cents of fifths, fourths and third deviations of the equal tempered scale?.&gt; &lt;That C-E is not periodic by any measure of the scale - in order for&gt; &lt;that dyad to be periodic, the two frequencies would have to be in some&gt; &lt;kind of rational relationship to one another. That E-G is pretty close (No, it is equal to the minor third - (2)(1/4) = 1,189207115 = Eq. T. Eb.&gt; &lt;to a 19/16 ratio and the C-G is exactly 3/2. That means that the C-E&gt; &lt;is going to be pretty close to a 24/19 ratio. BUT, even though it&apos;s&gt; &lt;going to be close to 24/19, having a scale that is close to periodic&gt; &lt;still won&apos;t mean that it&apos;s &quot;perfect&quot; for what western music&gt; &lt;traditionally wants, which is a major third that is close to 5/4.About E-G = (1,5 / 1,26134462288 ) = Eb = (2)(1/4)) = 1,189207115 This quotient is the needed relation between E and G and at the same time another support of E = 1,26134462288.     The tones (2)(1/4), (2)(1/2), (2)(3/4) and 2 are fundamental frequencies of (Eb, F#, A and Do) of Piagui and equal tempered scale. Thanks to this feature the only correct chord of equal tempered is DIMIN. DO, DIM. Eb, DIM F#, DIM A.Note Eb = (2)(1/4)) = 1,189207115      RegardsMARIO PIZARRO June 26--07:30 pmpiagui@...</p></div><h3><a id=77850 href="#77850">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2008 8:21:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &lt; Your entire basis for calling it perfect is that the wave is slightly<br/>&gt; &lt; closer to periodic.

If you would like to provide us with a chart of<br/>the errors from each interval, the RMS tuning error and TOP error and<br/>all of that, as well as a corresponding chart from 12-tet, then I&apos;d be<br/>happy to compare and take a look and help you interpret what the<br/>charts mean.</p><p>I will say that you cannot claim that the flat perfect fifth, which is<br/>4 cents flat from 12-equal, will be indistinguishable, but that the<br/>major third, which is 2 cents sharp from 12-equal, will be<br/>distinguishable.</p><p>It&apos;s a lose-lose: whenever the fifth is better than 12-equal, the<br/>major third will be slightly worse, and whenever the major third is<br/>better than 12-equal, the perfect fifth will significantly worse.</p><p>&gt; &iquest;Did you ever added the total cents of fifths, fourths and third deviations<br/>&gt; of the equal tempered scale?.</p><p>The equal tempered scale has an approximation of 3/2 that is roughly 2<br/>cents sharp, an approximation of 4/3 that is roughly 2 cents flat, an<br/>approximation of the 5/4 major third that is roughly 14 cents sharp,<br/>and an approximation of the 6/5 minor third that is roughly 16 cents<br/>flat. If you treat the equal tempered minor third as an approximation<br/>to 19/16, then it is only 2.5 cents sharp.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &lt;That C-E is not periodic by any measure of the scale - in order for<br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;that dyad to be periodic, the two frequencies would have to be in some<br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;kind of rational relationship to one another.

The quarter of an<br/>octave that is used in 12-tet and your scale is not 6/5 by any means,<br/>and is closer to 19/16. It is a workable approximation to 6/5 that<br/>most people won&apos;t notice: certainly does not make the scale offer<br/>&quot;perfect&quot; harmony.</p><p>&gt;&gt; &lt;to a 19/16 ratio and the C-G is exactly 3/2. That means that the C-E<br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;is going to be pretty close to a 24/19 ratio. BUT, even though it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;going to be close to 24/19, having a scale that is close to periodic<br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;still won&apos;t mean that it&apos;s &quot;perfect&quot; for what western music<br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;traditionally wants, which is a major third that is close to 5/4.<br/>&gt; About E&mdash;G = (1,5 / 1,26134462288 ) = Eb = (2)(1/4)) = 1,189207115<br/>&gt; This quotient is the needed relation between E and G and at the same<br/>&gt; time another support of E = 1,26134462288.</p><p>I don&apos;t know offhand what decimal numbers relate to what just<br/>relationships. Please write using fractions and exponents, not<br/>decimal.</p><p>&gt; The tones (2)(1/4), (2)(1/2), (2)(3/4) and 2 are fundamental frequencies of<br/>&gt; (Eb, F#, A and Do) of Piagui and equal tempered scale. Thanks to this<br/>&gt; feature the only correct chord of equal tempered is DIMIN. DO, DIM. Eb, DIM F#, DIM<br/>&gt; A.</p><p>If you arbitrarily define the &quot;correct&quot; diminished chord as 4 equal<br/>divisions of the octave.</p><p>&gt; Note Eb = (2)(1/4)) = 1,189207115<br/>&gt; Regards<br/>&gt; MARIO PIZARRO</p><p>Mario, I will say this: You cannot &quot;define&quot; perfect harmony to be<br/>something that is not in accordance with what the music community at<br/>large needs, and then claim that your scale offers perfect harmony.<br/>For the vast majority of western music out there, especially baroque<br/>and classical pieces that were composed in some kind of meantone<br/>tuning, then your scale will be just as imperfect, if not slightly<br/>more in certain situations, than 12 tone equal temperament.</p><p>The fact that the wave appears to be periodic doesn&apos;t matter, as the<br/>Hammond B3 organ&apos;s waves are all perfectly periodic, but the notes<br/>have relationships to one another like 2808 / 2975. After a certain<br/>point, the ear can no longer hear the periodicity of the wave except<br/>for a slight difference in beating.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how you define &quot;perfect,&quot; but the fact of the matter is<br/>that periodicity does not mean &quot;perfection&quot; of a chord or a triad. The<br/>other thing is that not only is the major third in the &quot;perfect&quot; chord<br/>even FARTHER from 5/4 just, the perfect fifths in the &quot;imperfect<br/>chords&quot;, of which there are four in piagui, are even further from just<br/>than the &quot;perfect&quot; piagui thirds are.</p><p>I think it is an interesting scale with interesting properties that in<br/>certain situations might lead to it being more advantageous than<br/>12-equal. I do not think it is a perfect scale that will handle the<br/>musical requirements of most music any better than 12-equal, but in<br/>certain situations, it may.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=77851 href="#77851">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2008 8:23:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; The C and the G together will be periodic.
