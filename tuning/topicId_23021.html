Just an<br/>&gt; idea.</p><p>Alison, if you look in the manual for my tuning program<br/>LMSO which I confidentially sent you last month, you will<br/>see that it does something extremely similar to this.</p><p>Set the Repeat Ratio to 4/3 and open the Interactive<br/>Quantize window. Set the IQ % to 0% so you will see the<br/>*current* values in the display. You may want to turn off<br/>&apos;Show gradients&apos; in the Preferences window. Choose ratios<br/>or cents for the graphical display, as you wish, then edit<br/>the Scale Pattern in the Scale Oven&apos;s Recipe in cents or<br/>ratios. Probably best to set the mode to Absolute Cents<br/>values so that your edits of the in between notes in the<br/>tetrachord will react linearly to your changes. Just place<br/>the cursor on top of the interval you wish to graphically<br/>edit and use the up/down arrows on your keyboard to move<br/>the note. You will see the change instantly in the<br/>graphical display.</p><p>By the way, I consider this nonobvious invention<br/>proprietary and anyone who steals it is asking for some<br/>serious ass kicking.</p><p>All the best,</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=23027 href="#23027">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/17/2001 12:36:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_23021.html#23021">/tuning/topicId_23021.html#23021</a></p><p>&gt; I was thinking the other day about an idea for a software<br/>&gt; tetrachord finder.
