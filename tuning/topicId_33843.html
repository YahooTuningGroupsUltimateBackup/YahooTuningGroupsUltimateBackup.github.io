Conspiracy theories abound<br/>at the Voice, but this one must set some kind of record for ridiculousness.<br/>Gann admits that I present &quot;plenty of evidence&quot; in<br/>support of the value of older tunings. Indeed, though<br/>he claims my book &quot;brushed aside&quot; the uniqueness<br/>of different approaches, I actually celebrate their<br/>variety. For example, I call them the musical<br/>equivalents of poet Robert Frost&apos;s notion of a sentence,<br/>in which &quot;notes strung as melodies and harmonies<br/>became suffused with particular shades and shapes.&quot;<br/>But, since I also value equal temperament and the<br/>&quot;exquisite music&quot; that resulted from that system, Gann,<br/>a narrow-minded purveyor of the new, politically hip,<br/>anti-equal-temperament movement in music, feels the<br/>need to attack. Unlike Gann&apos;s review, my book is not a<br/>polemic, but the history of an idea. It presents the<br/>evolution of that idea by demonstrating links between<br/>developments in music, art, science, philosophy, religion,<br/>and societal mores. Along the way, it explores why<br/>people fought over these issues, and how we got to where we are.<br/>I end Temperament with a question, bringing the<br/>narrative full circle to the tuning ideas of Pythagoras<br/>in the sixth century B.C.E. Gann thinks that means I<br/>should have gone back to the beginning and rewritten<br/>the whole thing. He misses the point, because he is an<br/>ideologue for whom only one way of doing things<br/>can be correct. I intentionally preserve the mystery<br/>inherent in this subject-the inability of anyone to arrive at a final<br/>answer.</p><p>Stuart Isacoff<br/>Bedford Hills, New York</p></div><h3><a id=33848 href="#33848">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2002 4:49:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>db,</p><p>Like Johnny, I&apos;d be curious to know where SI&apos;s rebuttal was posted.
