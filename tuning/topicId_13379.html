While the &quot;Gujerati Hindu musicians&quot; with whom you<br/>lived may have been of the same Gharana, and hence had a relatively high<br/>level of consensus amongst themselves compared to musicians from<br/>different Gharanas, I would recommend caution in assuming that any<br/>theory you have heard or read (especially in the writings of Danielou)<br/>is universally held amongst Hindustani Classical musicians.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>Christopher J.

I don&apos;t assume that any theory is universally held amongst<br/>Hindustani Classical musicians. The Danielou writings I refer to are often summaries of source<br/>materials and it would be hard for me to check them all out.   I should explain that<br/>over-riding the consensus that I have perceived in my contact with various Indian musicians<br/>was a bonding respect for tradition. In this I consider myself most fortunate, particularly in<br/>finding a teacher (with a capital &apos;G&apos;) who encouraged me to look for the Source. I thoroughly<br/>recommend this as an enterprise. Perhaps the respect  for tradition diminishes as Indian<br/>society changes and also as communities establish themselves outside of India. This invites<br/>variety, debate and change, all of which are stimulating. In addition I happen to believe in<br/>the spirit of many of the theories I&apos;ve read and heard rather than the letter. As a result my<br/>appreciation of sound, intonation and music has blossomed over the years and has given me the<br/>opportunity to share the fruits of my studies with countless others. As a counterbalance to<br/>all this I am studying my mathematics again and hopefully future postings will be more<br/>scientifically accurate.</p></div><h3><a id=13475 href="#13475">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

I have read and painstakingly copied several of his books and have played several Ragas according to his notation and observations. They seem to work just fine-- much more focused than Fox-Stangeways or Jhairzboy or any of the others who have attempted to lend a western nomenclature<br/>to an ethnic music.</p><p>pagano</p><p>P.s.
