The program looks at what notes are playing<br/>(and it may use some history as well as just the currently<br/>sounding tones) and then looks up in the tables how they ought<br/>to be retuned. Much of the analysis in the paper is devoted<br/>to constructing a good set of tables...</p><p>--Bill Sethares</p></div>
