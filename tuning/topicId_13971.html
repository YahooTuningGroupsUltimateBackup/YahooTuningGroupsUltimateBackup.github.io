Walking the gentle plateau: Mediants and intermediates<br/>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A leading feature of neo-Gothic temperaments in their most<br/>characteristic range between Pythagorean and 17-tET is the use of<br/>complex major and minor thirds as unstable intervals typically<br/>inviting resolutions to unisons or fifths, for example.</p><p>Major thirds are located on a &quot;plateau&quot; not too far from midway<br/>between the simpler ratios or &quot;valleys&quot; of 5:4 (~386.314 cents) and<br/>9:7 (~435.084 cents). Minor thirds are likewise located on a plateau<br/>between 7:6 (~266.871 cents) and 6:5 (~315.641 cents).</p><p>While all intervals in these plateau regions are rather complex,<br/>different neo-Gothic temperaments offer finely distinguished degrees<br/>of &quot;shading.&quot; For example, a Pythagorean major third at 81:64<br/>(~407.820 cents) may have a somewhat different flavor or &quot;color&quot; than<br/>a 29-tET major third at ~413.793 cents, or a 17-tET major third at<br/>~423.529 cents.</p><p>In placing Keenan&apos;s beautiful neo-Gothic temperament on this<br/>continuum, we can use a technique of exploration I term &quot;walking the<br/>gentle plateau,&quot; based in part on the same Classic and Noble Mediants<br/>we encountered in defining the tuning itself (Section 1).</p><p>Let us here focus on the plateau region for major thirds poised<br/>between 5:4 and 9:7. One reference point for this intermediate region<br/>is the Classic Mediant, defined simply as the sum of the two<br/>numerators over the sum of the two denominators:</p><p>                          (5 + 9)<br/>        ClassicMediant =  ------- = 14:11 = ~417.508 cents<br/>                          (4 + 7)</p><p>We may write this Classic Mediant either as 14:11, or in a mediant<br/>notation as (5+9):(4+7). This complex integer ratio is one of the<br/>&quot;Four Convivial Ratios&quot; of neo-Gothic theory closely approximated by<br/>Keenan&apos;s tuning (see Section 3 below).[9]</p><p>In exploring the plateau, a cardinal landmark of special interest is<br/>the rough &quot;midpoint&quot; of maximal complexity between 5:4 and 9:7, the<br/>point of &quot;gravitational balance&quot; as it were about equally remote from<br/>either simpler interval. Using Dave&apos;s application of the Noble Mediant<br/>to this problem, we can estimate the point of maximal complexity<br/>between the ratios i:j and m:n, where i:j is the simpler of the two<br/>ratios, as follows:</p><p>                                 (i + m Phi)<br/>                  NobleMediant = -----------<br/>                                 (j + n Phi)</p><p>Here 5:4 is somewhat simpler than 9:7, so we treat 5:4 as i:j and 9:7<br/>as m:n, with the following result:</p><p>                  (5 + 9 Phi)   ~19.5623<br/>   NobleMediant = ----------- = -------- = ~1.2764 = ~422.487 cents<br/>                  (4 + 7 Phi)   ~15.3262</p><p>Thus our theoretical point of maximal complexity is about 422.487<br/>cents, not far from the major third of 17-tET (~423.529 cents). Other<br/>ratios in the plateau region represent various shades or degrees of<br/>complexity which may &quot;slope&quot; slightly toward either 5:4 or 9:7.</p><p>In exploring these fine shadings, or &quot;walking the plateau,&quot; we can use<br/>a generalized variation of the mediant formulas to generate a variety<br/>of other ratios or &quot;weighted intermediates.&quot; As with the Noble<br/>Mediant, let us define i:j as the simpler of the two &quot;valley&quot; ratios<br/>(here 5:4) and m:n as the less simple ratio (here 9:7):</p><p>                                   (xi + ym)<br/>      WeightedIntermediate (y/x) = ---------<br/>                                   (xj + yn)</p><p>Here &quot;y&quot; is the weighting factor by which we multiply the terms of the<br/>more complex ratio (9:7), and &quot;x&quot; the factor by which we multiply the<br/>terms of the simpler ratio (5:4).</p><p>In the case of y/x=1, we have the Classic Mediant between 5:4 and 9:7<br/>of (5*1 + 9*1):(4*1 + 7*1), or simply (5+9):(4+7) or 14:11.</p><p>In the case of y/x=Phi, we have the Noble Mediant estimating the<br/>region of maximal complexity: (5*1 + 9*Phi):(4*1 + 7*Phi), or ~422.487<br/>cents.</p><p>The special case of the Noble Mediant where y/x=Phi, or ~1.618, serves<br/>as a cardinal point of orientation, the point of rough &quot;gravitational<br/>balance.&quot; As y/x becomes smaller, our plateau may tend to slope<br/>somewhat toward the simpler valley 5:4; as it becomes larger, we may<br/>be sloping somewhat toward the less simpler valley, 9:7.</p><p>Choosing other values for y/x allows us to explore other shades of<br/>complexity along the plateau, but with an important caution! If we<br/>wish to stay within the plateau region rather than inadvertantly<br/>wander into a valley, we need some sense of &quot;metes and bounds&quot; for<br/>this region.</p><p>A useful lower bound for the neo-Gothic plateau region between 5:4 and<br/>9:7 is the classic Pythagorean major third at 81:64 or ~407.820 cents.<br/>As it turns out, this represents a y/x ratio of 4/9:</p><p>                                 (5*9 + 9*4)   (45 + 36)   81<br/>    WeightedIntermediate (4/9) = ----------- = --------- = --<br/>                                 (4*9 + 7*4)   (36 + 28)   64</p><p>One possible upper bound occurs at y/x=2, or 23:18, ~424.364 cents or<br/>slightly beyond 17-tET:</p><p>                                 (5*1 + 9*2)   (5 + 18)   23<br/>    WeightedIntermediate (2/1) = ----------- = -------- = --<br/>                                 (4*1 + 7*2)   (4 + 14)   18</p><p>Walking the central plateau between these two ratios, we find a range<br/>of intermediate ratios and shades of complexity, of which some of the<br/>familiar and not so familiar ones are shown in the following &quot;map.&quot;</p><p>Here the main number line shows the sizes of major thirds in cents,<br/>with the notations above this line indicating Keenan&apos;s tuning (KP) and<br/>some equal temperaments.

For example, the 29-tET major third has an<br/>excellent approximation at y/x=8/11, or 127:100 (~413.794 cents), as<br/>compared to 10/29 octave at ~413.793 cents.</p><p>Now that our &quot;walk&quot; has situated Keenan&apos;s tuning in a fertile<br/>neo-Gothic plateau region, and we have a general map of the<br/>area, let us explore this tuning and its immediate neighborhood in<br/>more detail.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Keenan&apos;s tuning and the &quot;four convivial ratios&quot;<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>A fascinating feature of Keenan&apos;s Phi-based tuning is its close<br/>approximation of interval sizes for regular major and minor thirds,<br/>and also &quot;alternative thirds&quot; (diminished fourths and augmented<br/>seconds) which I affectionately term the &quot;Four Convivial Ratios.&quot;</p><p>For regular major and minor thirds, these ratios are 14:11 and 13:11.<br/>For alternative major and minor thirds, they are 21:17 and 17:14 --<br/>these intervals (or their approximations) being represented in the<br/>central neo-Gothic plateau region by diminished fourths and augmented<br/>seconds respectively.</p><p>The description of these four ratios as &quot;convivial&quot; alludes to the<br/>fact that all four occur or are closely approximated in a common<br/>region of the neo-Gothic spectrum of regular tunings.</p><p>This region ranges from slightly beyond 29-tET (fifth ~703.448 cents,<br/>~1.493 cents wide) to slightly beyond 46-tET (fifth ~704.348 cents,<br/>~2.393 cents wide), centered at a fifth size of around 704 cents, or 2<br/>cents wider than pure. A table may make this &quot;conviviality&quot; clearer by<br/>showing the size of fifth involved in a pure tuning of each of these<br/>four complex intervals:</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>Interval Ratio     Cents      Fifth    Temperament<br/>--------------------------------------------------<br/>   m3    13:11   ~289.210   ~703.597    ~+1.641<br/> aug2    17:14   ~336.130   ~704.014    ~+2.059<br/> dim4    21:17   ~365.825   ~704.272    ~+2.317<br/>   M3    14:11   ~417.508   ~704.377    ~+2.422<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>With its fifth at around 704.096 cents, or ~2.141 cents wider than<br/>pure, Keenan&apos;s tuning seems ideally situated to approximate all four<br/>ratios. Before confirming this point, let us consider the nature of<br/>the four ratios themselves.</p><p>Most obviously, all four ratios define _complex_ thirds, intervals<br/>fitting an active role in neo-Gothic cadential progressions, and also<br/>serving as &quot;pregnant pauses&quot; at the end of a musical phrase or section<br/>giving a feeling of momentarily suspended motion.</p><p>While the regular thirds at or near 14:11 and 13:11 may be seen as<br/>somewhat exaggerated versions of the usual Pythagorean 81:64 and<br/>32:27, the &quot;alternative&quot; thirds at or near 21:17 and 17:14 have<br/>a quality at once comparably complex and yet different. They might be<br/>described respectively as &quot;submajor&quot; and &quot;superminor&quot; thirds<br/>(following the interval names of Manuel op de Coul&apos;s Scala<br/>program).[10]</p><p>It is from this general musical perspective that we might consider<br/>some fine points of possible mathematical interpretations.</p><p>As we have seen, 14:11 is the Classic Mediant between 5:4 and 9:7, or<br/>(5+9):(4+7). Interestingly, 13:11 is likewise the Classic Mediant<br/>between 7:6 and 6:5, written (6+7):(5+6) if we wish to follow the<br/>convention of placing the terms of the simpler &quot;valley&quot; ratio (here<br/>6:5) first.</p><p>With 21:17 and 17:14, mediant-oriented interpretations may be somewhat<br/>more tentative and ambiguous.</p><p>One possible interpretation might be that as a &quot;superminor&quot; third,<br/>17:14 represents an intermediate form between the minor third &quot;valley&quot;<br/>at 6:5 and a possible neutral third &quot;valley&quot; at 11:9 (~347.408 cents).<br/>If so, it is the Classic Mediant (6+11):(5+9).</p><p>Such an explanation raises the question of whether and to what extend<br/>11:9 is a distinct &quot;valley&quot; in itself.[11] A different interpretation<br/>might consider 17:14 to be a weighted intermediate between the clearer<br/>valleys of 6:5 and 5:4, leaning more toward 6:5. If so, then y/x=2/1<br/>will produce this interval:</p><p>                                   (5 + 6*2)   (5 + 12)   17<br/>      WeightedIntermediate (2/1) = --------- = -------- = --<br/>                                   (4 + 5*2)   (4 + 10)   14</p><p>Interestingly, 17:14 (~336.130 cents) is quite close to the Noble<br/>Mediant between 6:5 and 5:4, in theory a region of maximal complexity,<br/>where y/x=Phi:</p><p>                   (5 + 6*Phi)   ~14.7082<br/>   NobleMediant =  ----------- = -------- = ~1.2165 = ~339.344 cents<br/>                   (4 + 5*Phi)   ~12.0902</p><p>For the submajor third at 21:17, at least two interpretations are<br/>likewise possible. If we take this interval to be a weighted<br/>intermediate between 11:9 (regarded as a &quot;valley&quot;) and 5:4, then a<br/>value of y/x=1/2 would result in this ratio:</p><p>                                 (5*2 + 11)   (10 + 11)   21<br/>    WeightedIntermediate (1/2) = ---------- = --------- = --<br/>                                 (4*2 + 9)     (8 + 9)    17</p><p>As this weighting somewhat toward the simpler 5:4 ratio indicates, we<br/>have a &quot;submajor&quot; rather than more neutral third, a conclusion also<br/>congenial to an alternative interpretation of 21:17 as a weighted<br/>intermediate between 6:5 and 5:4 with y/x=1/3:</p><p>                                 (5*3 + 6)    (15 + 6)   21<br/>    WeightedIntermediate (1/3) = ---------- = -------- = --<br/>                                 (4*3 + 5)    (12 + 5)   17</p><p>At an intuitive level, viewing 17:14 and 21:17 as weighted<br/>intermediates between 5:4 and 6:5 may give at least a basic idea of<br/>their character. At y/x=2/1, 17:14 leans in a &quot;superminor&quot; direction,<br/>while at y/x=1/3, 21:17 has a &quot;submajor&quot; quality. The Classic Mediant<br/>of 5:4 and 6:5 where y/x=1, (5+6):(4+5) or 11:9, is the familiar<br/>&quot;neutral&quot; third.</p><p>Whatever the mathematical fine points of these four &quot;convivial&quot; and<br/>complex ratios for neo-Gothic thirds, Keenan&apos;s tuning felicitously<br/>approximates all four ratios within 1.5 cents:</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Interval Ratio    Cents    Example     Actual Size    Variance<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>   m3    13:11  ~289.210     D-F        ~287.713      ~-1.497<br/>   M3    14:11  ~417.508     F-A        ~416.382      ~-1.126<br/> aug2    17:14  ~336.130     Bb-C#      ~336.860      ~+0.731<br/> dim4    21:17  ~365.825     C#-F       ~367.235      ~+1.410<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As might not be unfitting in a tuning itself based on Phi, we find<br/>that the augmented fifth, e.g. F-C#, at ~832.765 cents, gives an<br/>outstanding approximation of Phi itself (~833.090 cents), a variance<br/>of only ~0.325 cents in the narrow direction.</p><p>In a standard 12-note tuning of Eb-G#, we might use this interval in a<br/>variant of the familiar 13th-century cadence where minor third expands<br/>to fifth and minor sixth to octave, with whole-tone motion in all<br/>voices. Here some of the usual intervals are altered, with vertical<br/>intervals above the lowest voice shown in parentheses and melodic<br/>intervals as signed values showing ascending (positive) or descending<br/>(negative) motion. In this MIDI-style notation, C4 is middle C:</p><p>  C#4 -- +159.0 -- Eb4<br/>(832.8)          (1200)<br/>  G#3 -- +159.0 -- Bb3<br/>(336.9)          (704.1)<br/>  F3  -- -208.2 -- Eb3</p><p>The vertical intervals of the augmented second and augmented fifth are<br/>resolved by a usual descending whole-step in the lowest voice coupled<br/>with ascending melodic steps of a diminished third in the upper voices<br/>(G#-Bb, C#-Eb), an interval of ~159.044 cents or around 3/4-tone.</p><p>As we expand this tuning beyond 12 notes to 17 or 24, there are other<br/>surprises, including some &quot;crunchy&quot; Pepperian narrow fourths at<br/>~465.530 cents, quite close to 21:16. These features call for an<br/>article in themselves.</p><p>---------------------------------------------<br/>4. Mathematical tunings and musical qualities<br/>---------------------------------------------</p><p>In approaching &quot;mathematically defined&quot; tunings such as Kornerup&apos;s<br/>Golden Meantone or Kennan Pepper&apos;s neo-Gothic counterpart, we<br/>encounter two schools of opinion which may invite a third intermediate<br/>approach -- a kind of philosophical mediant, as it were.</p><p>One kind of opinion presents such systems as &quot;tunings to end all<br/>tunings&quot; -- or, at least, especially favored and privileged choices<br/>when compared to more familiar tunings of the same general variety,<br/>historical or otherwise.</p><p>Another kind of opinion regards such tunings based on mathematical<br/>quantities such as Phi, pi, Euler&apos;s e, etc., as inherently suspect<br/>exercises in &quot;numerology&quot; or the like. Here the argument seems to be<br/>that a tuning should be defined around mathematical parameters with<br/>some evident psychoacoustical significance, as opposed to arbitrary<br/>constants which happen to produce interesting musical results.</p><p>A &quot;mediant&quot; approach might be to regard tunings based on arbitrary<br/>mathematical constants -- a scale-building constant such as Phi or pi,<br/>an interval ratio such as 14:11 or (5+9):(4+7), and so forth -- as<br/>points on the xenharmonic continuum with &quot;equal citizenship.&quot; Such<br/>tunings supplement, but do not supplant, other tunings.</p><p>For example, Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone serves as a musically<br/>interesting compromise between 1/4-comma meantone with pure major<br/>thirds and Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma with equally tempered major and minor<br/>thirds. Like these tunings, it is a shade of temperament.</p><p>John Harrison&apos;s meantone tuning based on a ratio of pi or ~3.14159<br/>between the octave and the major third, adopted by Charles Lucy in his<br/>system of LucyTuning, has fifths at ~695.493 cents (~6.462 cents<br/>narrower than pure). This temperament, moving about a third of the way<br/>from 2/7-comma to 1/3-comma or 19-tET, has as one of its properties<br/>diminished fourths at ~436.056 cents, very close to a pure 9:7.</p><p>If one grants the validity of all points on the continuum, then<br/>choosing an attractive mathematical constant and letting a tuning take<br/>shape around it is a perfectly valid strategy. It produces a tuning<br/>with qualities which can be deduced at least in part from an analysis<br/>of interval sizes and nearby tunings, etc.</p><p>At the same time, such an approach has a charming &quot;emblematic&quot; or<br/>&quot;heraldic&quot; quality which appeals to the intellect, and can be<br/>appreciated while recognizing the validity of other tunings also.</p><p>Dan Stearns, in his recent articles on exploring or &quot;hiking&quot; various<br/>&quot;trails&quot; of tunings based on Phi, suggests the attractiveness of this<br/>kind of approach which can take us to musically interesting places<br/>while leaving us free to roam throughout the continuum.[12]</p><p>---------------<br/>Notes to Part 2<br/>---------------</p><p>9. While in theory the Classic Mediant may define a &quot;valley&quot; in its own<br/>right between two simpler or &quot;deeper&quot; valleys -- e.g. 9:7 in relation<br/>to 5:4 and 4:3, i.e. (5+4):(4+3) -- our ratio of 14:11 seems too<br/>complex to serve as such a distinctly audible valley. Dave Keenan has<br/>noted his own experimental finding that 14:11 is not tuneable by ear,<br/>while Paul Erlich has proposed the test that if a ratio a:b has a<br/>product of the two terms a*b&gt;105, then the ratio is complex rather<br/>than simple. With 14:11, a*b = 154, defining this ratio as complex<br/>according to Paul&apos;s test as well as Dave&apos;s experiment.</p><p>10. See <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/intervals.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/doc/intervals.html</a>. In<br/>medievalist terms, where regular major and minor thirds are known<br/>respectively as ditones (equal to two whole-tones) and semiditones<br/>(equal to a whole-tone plus a diatonic semitone), intervals at or near<br/>21:17 or 17:14 might be called &quot;subditones&quot; and &quot;suprasemiditones.&quot;</p><p>11. Applying Paul Erlich&apos;s test, 11:9 has a*b=99, so is near the upper<br/>limit of a*b=105 for a &quot;simple&quot; interval ratio.</p><p>12.

One reference point for this intermediate region<br/>&gt; is the Classic Mediant, defined simply as the sum of the two<br/>&gt; numerators over the sum of the two denominators:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                           (5 + 9)<br/>&gt;         ClassicMediant =  ------- = 14:11 = ~417.508 cents<br/>&gt;                           (4 + 7)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We may write this Classic Mediant either as 14:11, or in a mediant<br/>&gt; notation as (5+9):(4+7). This complex integer ratio is one of the<br/>&gt; &quot;Four Convivial Ratios&quot; of neo-Gothic theory closely approximated by<br/>&gt; Keenan&apos;s tuning (see Section 3 below).[9]<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
