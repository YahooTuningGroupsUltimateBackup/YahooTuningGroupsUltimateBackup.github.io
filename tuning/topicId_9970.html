The cochlea seems more miraculous, though, in that it is capable of<br/>resolving thousands of frequencies at once, while a point in the eye cannot<br/>so much as resolve two different frequencies at once. The eye compensates by<br/>being able to resolve millions of distinct points in two dimensions, while<br/>with only two ears we only have a rough idea of where a sound is coming<br/>from.
