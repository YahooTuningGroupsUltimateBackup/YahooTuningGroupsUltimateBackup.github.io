I think the question was &quot;any ideas on how to improve my scale?&quot; and I thought my formulas incorporated into complex tones answered the question.</p><p>Have you read my book? (the latest corrected version is in the &quot;Files&quot; link to the left). If you haven&apos;t, check out chapters 4, 6, 7, 10 and 11.</p><p>You mentioned &quot;TONS of symmetries&quot; which was a huge criterion for me when I worked out my NPT scale. See how many symmetries occur with my scale and let me know what comes up.</p><p>As regards &quot;the *best* scale&quot;, when I began in 1995 I was looking for the *single* best system possible for all instruments based on the following 3 ideas.</p><p>1. How many keys per octave? I play guitar and when I built my NPT guitar I figured that adding more notes (i.e. frets) would clutter the fretboard and it would be harder to play. I know there are some just guitars out there with 19 or 22 keys per octave but I feel that this is overkill and for me 12 is the golden mean between simplicity and complexity. Also the transition from 12TET to 12 tone NPT should be easy.</p><p>2. Choose the strongest notes paired with the tonic, or maximize the overall number of &quot;good&quot; intervals? I had to reach a compromise here to get the best of both worlds. This is outlined in chapter 7 of my book and my choices were well informed and seem very reasonable.</p><p>3. It seems to me that it is impossible to have a 12 key &quot;just&quot; tuning system where 1/1 (lower tonic) has the same strength as 2/1 (higher tonic). My notes again are:</p><p>1/1, 15/14, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 9/5, 15/8, 2/1.</p><p>If you replace 15/14 with 16/15 (this is the standard JI scale, I call it &quot;Natural Up&quot;) then if you are playing a melody then &apos;landing&apos; on 1/1 is sweeter than &apos;landing&apos; on 2/1. (i.e. 1/1 is stronger than 2/1).</p><p>Also &quot;Natural Up&quot; is mathematically (using my formula for quantifying the strength of a scale) 2% sytronger than NPT. However it&apos;s a bit one sided (asymmetrical). With only one strong tonic.</p><p>The inverse of the &quot;Natural Up&quot; scale is the same as NPT but with 45/32 instead of 7/5. I call it &quot;Natural Down&quot;. In this case the tonic is 3/2. With this scale the *higher* tonic (3/1) is stronger than the lower tonic (3/2). Again, this scale is 2% stronger than NPT.</p><p>Which do we choose, Up or Down? Both have exactly equal strength but are not symmetrical. NPT however has *two* tonics of equal strength (1/1 and 3/2). One is better for ascending music and the other for descending music. NPT *is* symmetrical.</p><p>This is why I think it&apos;s the *best* but I must concede that this could be purely a matter of taste, some might prefer Natural Up to NPT although in my opinion NPT is the most versatile, particularly for chromatic (using all 12 keys) music.</p><p>All of the above is based on maths. So, if you can have a &quot;best&quot; system (according to 1, 2 and 3 above) for pure sine wave tones then surely you can have a &quot;best&quot; system (according to 1, 2 and 3 above) for complex tones.</p><p>John.</p></div><h3><a id=87459 href="#87459">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2010 2:58:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; This is why I think it&apos;s the *best* but I must concede that this could be purely a matter of taste...</p><p>Nail, meet hammer.

A lot of you will probably find this insulting, because I&apos;m about to dismiss the very things on which you&apos;ve spent many years of your life working very intently.  I understand that this will make you mad.  Sorry, but I just can&apos;t keep my mouth shut any longer.</p><p>First I&apos;d like to say that I think &quot;simple&quot; 5-limit JI scales meant to maximize consonance and &quot;intuneness&quot; are absolutely boring.  I&apos;ll go so far as to say that I think that the pure fifth (i.e. 3/2 ratio or the third harmonic) is without a doubt the most hackneyed, tired, plain, over-used, washed-up, past-its-prime, boring, unexpressive interval in all of music.  I believe that demanding a pure or nearly-pure fifth in a scale severely reduces the degree to which it is possible to make &quot;new, fresh, interesting, unusual, idiosyncratic&quot; music in that scale, and that the most exciting musical possibilities are truly to be found in scales that &quot;mis-tune&quot; the fifth by NO LESS than fifteen cents sharp OR flat.</p><p>I can say that in my experience as a musician, as someone who has indeed given JI and near-5-limit-JI systems like 31-tET a more-than-fair shake, the improvements these systems offer (in a 5-limit context) over 12-tone ET are utterly negligible.  What is the POINT of everything being more in-tune?  Are your ears so sensitive that you just can&apos;t bear hearing a major third that is 15&cent; sharp?  Okay, yeah, 5-limit JI &quot;sounds nice&quot;, you can hold the notes forever and never hear them beat.  The intervals are familiar and comforting and totally unobjectionable, like those ubiquitous Monet water-lily prints.  When I&apos;m in the mood for zenlike contemplation of the mystical oneness of the universe, or if I&apos;m freaking out on some psychotropic and need something to calm me down, I might like to hear the sound of the first 6 partials of the harmonic series sustained at equal volume in pure sine waves for 20 minutes.  But hey--you can hear the entire harmonic series in the sound of a single guitar string being plucked through a good overdrive pedal.</p><p>Honestly, all this talk about re-tuning classical music, trying to solve the puzzles of tuning JI, trying to find &quot;the perfect scale&quot; for Western music--you&apos;re all putting makeup on a corpse.  I will even concede to you all that you&apos;ve SUCCEEDED: congratulations, you did it, you found the BEST TUNING for western music.  But guess what?  This music goes back almost a thousand years--there is an utterly unfathomable library of music in the western tradition, all based on the same fundamental principles that you guys have FINALLY discovered and codified into a system.  This system you guys have finally perfected is DEAD.  Its lifeless zombie corpse has been shambling through concert halls and conservatories for GENERATIONS.  All you&apos;ve succeeded in doing is making the zombie PRETTIER.  12-tone-based western music has been UTTERLY systematized, totally mapped out, all the chord progressions, all the cadences, all the modulations: all studied, recorded, and quantified to DEATH.  David Cope has written a computer program that can write western music: if a computer can do it, why should a human continue to bother with it?</p><p>Now, I&apos;m the LAST person who would ever advocate serialism or atonality, but in a world married to a 12-tone scale wherein even the resources of chromatic harmony have been plumbed for CENTURIES, atonality sure must&apos;ve seemed like the only place left to go.  Some people have started exploring microtonality: 5-limit JI, 19- and 31-tone ETs, even quartertones, but only a HANDFUL have been willing to give up 3/2 as the basis for music.    Bohlen and Pierce had the right idea but maybe not the right scale (though I&apos;ll take 13-EDT over 19-EDO any day).  When you let the &quot;fifth&quot; slide far enough from 3/2, you open up all sorts of new structural possibilities, new consonances, new ways to make music that have been totally untapped.  Why is there so little interest in this?  Please, people, get over your &quot;PERFECT TUNINGS&quot;, the musical community at large doesn&apos;t want them, and the specialists in this community will never agree on them, so unless YOU can WRITE (and probably PERFORM) something really compelling with them, what value do you really think they have?</p><p>And all this talk about mathematical evaluations of consonance...please.  What are you gonna use it for, REALLY?  You can call up any scale and hear how it sounds immediately with free computer software, so your EARS can tell you perfectly well whether something sounds consonant.  WHY do you need a mathematical description?  I just don&apos;t get it.</p><p>Good luck.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; This is why I think it&apos;s the *best* but I must concede that this could be purely a matter of taste...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nail, meet hammer.

I think the<br/>question was &quot;any ideas on how to improve my scale?&quot; and I thought my<br/>formulas incorporated into complex tones answered the question.&quot;<br/>     Ah ok...seeing that you had wrote it in the other e-mails about your own scale already with no direct mention of the scale I derived from both of our scales...I was under the impression you were leaning toward advertising your own scale.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You mentioned &quot;TONS of symmetries&quot; which was a huge criterion for me<br/>when I worked out my NPT scale. See how many symmetries occur with my<br/>scale and let me know what comes up.&quot;<br/>  Good idea...I will.  Already I know the notes it has in common with my latest scale are symmetrical about the octave.<br/>&gt;&quot;check out chapters 4, 6, 7, 10 and 11.&quot;<br/>    Sure thing...you actually did get it right that x/y shows that critical band dissonance in most but not all cases gets less as an interval gets further away...but what is missing is that the measurement is curved...starting with dissonance as minimal at 1/1 and becoming more dissonant exponentially until it hits about 1.05 (IE 1.006 actually sounds quite consonant, almost like a chorus effect), then going down exponentially after that until about 5/4 or so where the exponential curve starts curving up.  Again, Plomp and Llevelt already did this experiment...and the curve was certainly not the straight line implied by x/y.</p><p>   You also said 16/15 (1.06666) is the most dissonant interval to your ear...but then (ironically) you use 15/14 and other intervals incredibly close to it as intervals in your scale.  Note...so does diatonic JI...and that is one of the reasons I think diatonic JI can be improved upon...at least so far as critical band dissonance.<br/>  Not to be pushy but, why don&apos;t you move toward wider intervals such as 13/12 as I have if your ears indeed objects to 16/15 (as does mine)?</p><p>&gt;&quot;1. How many keys per octave? I play guitar and when I built my NPT<br/>guitar I figured that adding more notes (i.e. frets) would clutter the<br/>fretboard and it would be harder to play.&quot;<br/>Right...short of a fretless guitar with marking for the right tones keeping track of a huge number of frets per octave would be a nightmare.  I&apos;d say anywhere from 9 to 14 is fairly ideal...and 12 is definitely within that range.  Agreed...good choice. ;-)<br/>&gt;&quot;2. Choose the strongest notes paired with the tonic, or maximize the<br/>overall number of &quot;good&quot; intervals? I had to reach a compromise here to<br/>get the best of both worlds.&quot;<br/>  Ah, so you do also use/admit that word &quot;compromise&quot;...glad to hear. :-)  I will admit though, I lean toward maximizing the number of good intervals as I believe it gives the composer a stronger sense of what to expect in the range of consonance from best-to-worst intervals for all possible intervals in the scale is smaller.  That&apos;s a reason why my scale merges toward 7TET, it&apos;s trying to &quot;equalize&quot; the power of possible tonics as much as possible without suffering much periodic dissonance (which 7TET has loads of).</p><p>&gt;&quot;3. It seems to me that it is impossible to have a 12 key &quot;just&quot; tuning<br/>system where 1/1 (lower tonic) has the same strength as 2/1 (higher<br/>tonic). My notes again are 1/1, 15/14, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 9/5, 15/8, 2/1.&quot;<br/>  Pardon my impatience (though I&apos;m sure I could find this out by reading your book for a long enough period of time...but what exactly would makes 1/1 and 2/1 have the &quot;same strength&quot;?</p><p>&gt;&quot;Also &quot;Natural Up&quot; is mathematically (using my formula for quantifying<br/>the strength of a scale) 2% stronger than NPT. However it&apos;s a bit one<br/>sided (asymmetrical) . With only one strong tonic&quot;<br/>  Ah so (to you) symmetrical to, say, 1/1 means strength of all possible intervals relative to the tonic of 1/1?  I tend to think one-sided-ness is best avoided, even if it results in &quot;imperfect&quot; intervals relative to the &quot;strongest&quot; tonic...that&apos;s where, in my mind, temperament comes in to try and make all intervals nearly &quot;equally strong&quot;...hopefully at least within 7 cents and definitely within 15 cents (anything beyond that I&apos;ve found really starts to have periodicity issues).</p><p>&gt;&quot;NPT however has *two* tonics of equal strength (1/1 and 3/2). One is<br/>better for ascending music and the other for descending music. NPT *is*<br/>symmetrical.&quot;<br/>   Then I guess I&apos;ll just have to cast my vote for NPT. ;-)</p><p>&gt;&quot;All of the above is based on maths. So, if you can have a &quot;best&quot; system<br/>(according to 1, 2 and 3 above) for pure sine wave tones then surely<br/>you can have a &quot;best&quot; system (according to 1, 2 and 3 above) for<br/>complex tones.&quot;<br/>    Exactly.  But how do you plan to rate dissonance with complex tones when different combinations of tones (and yes, that includes all tones and not just the two &quot;tonics&quot; you mentioned) produce different overtone conflicts...unless you make split all possible chords into all possible intervals or make like Sethares and compare the dissonance all possible intervals period?<br/>   What you&apos;ve said here you use to analyze &quot;critical band dissonance&quot; seems to only compare one ratio at a time...how do you plan to apply that to a scale with hundreds of possible intervals?</p></div><h3><a id=87475 href="#87475">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2010 9:23:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>JonSzanto&gt;&quot;There *is* no one, true, perfect system. Music is too big for that.&quot;<br/>Agreed.  Different systems are better for different tasks.  I ditched my Silver Scale system ages ago because of periodicity issues...but then saw some musicians resurrect it and actually use that &quot;problem&quot; to make their harmony&apos;s &quot;clash in confident rhythms&quot;.  I tend to stay away from scales like 53TET because of the hassle of moving notes up and down a step for purity, intentional dissonance, and/or emotional effect...but other musicians flock to it for that same reason (they like that &apos;hassle&apos;...or just plain old think it&apos;s worth it).<br/>  Some musicians prefer scales that purify thirds because they like using thirds, or 12TET because they like using virtually perfect 5ths, or 1/4 comma mean-tone because they like having virtually every interval within a 1/4 comma of perfect though never quite perfect.<br/>  Every scale is going to swap the purity of one interval for some other type...it&apos;s mathematically impossible to, say, have a 7-note scale with all perfect intervals starting from all possible notes to all other notes.  The question is, what type of purity and how much purity do you want and, say, how many notes and how much purity plus how much ease of use are you willing to fore-go to get more notes for tonal flexibility.</p><p>   Tuning is a game of compromise...with several different possible peaks.  You just have to decide which one you want to build or climb...and realize there will always be something on someone else&apos;s peak that your peak is missing and vice-versa.</p></div><h3><a id=87478 href="#87478">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2010 10:01:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>CityofAsleep&gt;&quot;First I&apos;d like to say that I think &quot;simple&quot; 5-limit JI scales meant to<br/>maximize consonance and &quot;intuneness&quot; are absolutely boring.&quot;<br/>    Agreed.

If I have to drop a pure fifth for a pure third or a pure third for a &quot;super-particular&quot; pure second...I&apos;ll do it in a heartbeat.  Hence my scales are chalk-full of super-particular seconds.<br/>   Also, from a harmonic standpoint, the fifth basically just strengthens the root rather than add emotion to it...it&apos;s almost as non-emotion-adding as playing a note and an octave above it (which doesn&apos;t really change the mood at all and simply alters the &quot;timbre&quot; of the root tone by stacking a much louder first overtone on top of it&quot;).</p><p>&gt;&quot;the improvements these systems offer (in a 5-limit context) over 12-tone ET are utterly negligible. &quot;<br/>   Right, 12TET is at most about 13-cents off, which isn&apos;t noticeable to most people.  But one thing that IS very hard to use in 12TET in chords is consecutive minor seconds.  Why?  Because (look at Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s curves) critical dissonance peaks at about 1.05 and the minor second in 12TET is 1.05999 (pretty lousy interval for chords)!  So I say to hell with that &quot;standard&quot; and use 13/12 and 12/11 as a new type of minor second and find (GASP!) that I can finally make chords that are considered illegal in 12TET using minor seconds work.  Aha...something new!   In the meantime most all other intervals in the scale are within 13 cents of pure.  Aha...new advantage with little disadvantage...I figure, why would many musicians not be able to appreciate such an option?<br/>&gt;&quot;All you&apos;ve succeeded in doing is making the zombie PRETTIER.&quot;<br/>   For several types of purifications, I actually agree with you.  But look closely at what people like Sethares, myself, and Erv Wilson are doing.  We are often using intervals not present in common practice.<br/>&gt;&quot;but only a HANDFUL have been willing to give up 3/2 as the basis for music.&quot;<br/>  Same goes for that, none of said above people use 3/2 and the &quot;circle of fifths&quot; as the basis. Ptolemy used tetra-chords instead of circles.  I actually like even Ptolemy&apos;s early systems much better than Pythagorus&apos;s.<br/>  Heck, I refuse to use the circle of thirds, fourths, etc. either.  My PHI and Silver scales were defined by sections, not exponential powers of an interval over 2^x (octaves).  My new scales are defined by both sections and super-particular symmetries.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And all this talk about mathematical evaluations of consonance..<br/>.please. What are you gonna use it for, REALLY? You can call up any<br/>scale and hear how it sounds immediately with free computer software,<br/>so your EARS can tell you perfectly well whether something sounds<br/>consonant. WHY do you need a mathematical description? I just don&apos;t get<br/>it.&quot;<br/>   This is the one thing I actually don&apos;t agree with.  Agreed it&apos;s VERY easy to find the consonance of any given dyad...that&apos;s what Plomp and Llevelt accomplished ages ago with their dissonance curve.  But, guess what...a scale can have any COMBINATION of intervals.  Want all possible intervals far enough to be recognizable to the ear as different?  Try counting them 1.005 1.010 1.015...thousands if not millions of them!<br/>       And if you have 3 notes in the scale, you have 3 possible dyads, not too bad.  5 notes?  Try more like 10.  12 notes?  Don&apos;t ask.  And guess what...if you purify one interval, you can easily make 4 of the others go sour...often more than 13 cents sour and to the point it&apos;s notice-able.   You can compare all notes to all other notes as sets of dyads using a computer program...that&apos;s exactly what Sethares did.  But even he neglected the fact that chords have an added factor: they often produce sound-waves that don&apos;t repeat and this repeating produces a second type of &quot;periodic&quot; dissonance.  So 1.1066 may sound fine to you as a single note but not in a chord.   If you look up how mp3&apos;s are compressed they use temporal masking and ignore sound changes that happen within a tenth of a second.  Guess what happens when your precious chord doesn&apos;t repeat/isn&apos;t-periodic-at every 10th of a second or less?  Your ear has trouble processing it, regardless of<br/> how well each interval works by itself.</p><p>    And such, consonance because an &quot;optimization&quot; game with not one but several factors...all of which have a habit of breaking a leak in one place when you patch another.  That&apos;s what makes it such a challenge.

The intervals are familiar and comforting and totally unobjectionable, like those ubiquitous Monet water-lily prints. When I&apos;m in the mood for zenlike contemplation of the mystical oneness of the universe, or if I&apos;m freaking out on some psychotropic and need something to calm me down, I might like to hear the sound of the first 6 partials of the harmonic series sustained at equal volume in pure sine waves for 20 minutes. But hey--you can hear the entire harmonic series in the sound of a single guitar string being plucked through a good overdrive pedal.</p><p>Or played clean.</p><p>And if you&apos;re on something psychotropic, you need to get to the 7th<br/>harmonic AT LEAST, or it&apos;s all hopeless. Hopeless, hopeless, hopeless.</p><p>&gt; Honestly, all this talk about re-tuning classical music, trying to solve the puzzles of tuning JI, trying to find &quot;the perfect scale&quot; for Western music--you&apos;re all putting makeup on a corpse. I will even concede to you all that you&apos;ve SUCCEEDED: congratulations, you did it, you found the BEST TUNING for western music. But guess what? This music goes back almost a thousand years--there is an utterly unfathomable library of music in the western tradition, all based on the same fundamental principles that you guys have FINALLY discovered and codified into a system. This system you guys have finally perfected is DEAD. Its lifeless zombie corpse has been shambling through concert halls and conservatories for GENERATIONS. All you&apos;ve succeeded in doing is making the zombie PRETTIER. 12-tone-based western music has been UTTERLY systematized, totally mapped out, all the chord progressions, all the cadences, all the modulations: all studied, recorded, and quantified to DEATH. David Cope has written a computer program that can write western music: if a computer can do it, why should a human continue to bother with it?</p><p>Wait, what is it? what&apos;s the best tuning? Did I miss it? Is it<br/>quarter-comma meantone?</p><p>&gt; Now, I&apos;m the LAST person who would ever advocate serialism or atonality, but in a world married to a 12-tone scale wherein even the resources of chromatic harmony have been plumbed for CENTURIES, atonality sure must&apos;ve seemed like the only place left to go. Some people have started exploring microtonality: 5-limit JI, 19- and 31-tone ETs, even quartertones, but only a HANDFUL have been willing to give up 3/2 as the basis for music. Bohlen and Pierce had the right idea but maybe not the right scale (though I&apos;ll take 13-EDT over 19-EDO any day). When you let the &quot;fifth&quot; slide far enough from 3/2, you open up all sorts of new structural possibilities, new consonances, new ways to make music that have been totally untapped. Why is there so little interest in this? Please, people, get over your &quot;PERFECT TUNINGS&quot;, the musical community at large doesn&apos;t want them, and the specialists in this community will never agree on them, so unless YOU can WRITE (and probably PERFORM) something really compelling with them, what value do you really think they have?</p><p>Jesus, why do you hate 3/2 all that much?</p><p>&gt; And all this talk about mathematical evaluations of consonance...please. What are you gonna use it for, REALLY?

You&apos;re in a class by yourself, IMHO!  I guess I do see your point about why you want to find good mathematical formulae to predict consonance, though...it seems like you have a very specific goal in mind for scales you want to create, and JI is so infinite that kludging through all the different possibilities would be pretty tiresome.  I guess that&apos;s why I&apos;m an EDO guy...well, that and the fact that I like the roughness of tempered intervals.</p><p>I really do like your approach of using intervals smaller than a major second in chords.  Some of my favorite EDOs work well for this approach too, like 18 and 20 and 23.  In 13-EDO, I think chords made of stacked major and minor seconds are the pinnacle of consonance (in that metatuning at least), and work quite well.  Though FWIW I don&apos;t find stacked minor 2nds all that offensive in 12-tET, in the right context.  Like the chord G-B-C-D-E-F-F#...complex but not offensive to my ears.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; CityofAsleep&gt;&quot;First I&apos;d like to say that I think &quot;simple&quot; 5-limit JI scales meant to<br/>&gt; maximize consonance and &quot;intuneness&quot; are absolutely boring.&quot;<br/>&gt;     Agreed.  I typically start at around 9-limit and have been known to go above 13-limit. ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;I&apos;ll go so far as to say that I think that the pure fifth (i.e. 3/2<br/>&gt; ratio or the third harmonic) is without a doubt the most hackneyed,<br/>&gt; tired, plain, over-used, washed-up, past-its-prime, boring,<br/>&gt; unexpressive interval in all of music.&quot;<br/>&gt;   Which is why you&apos;ll see many of my scales don&apos;t jump through hoops to purify fifths...they go for purifying the smallest intervals first and work their way up.  If I have to drop a pure fifth for a pure third or a pure third for a &quot;super-particular&quot; pure second...I&apos;ll do it in a heartbeat.  Hence my scales are chalk-full of super-particular seconds.<br/>&gt;    Also, from a harmonic standpoint, the fifth basically just strengthens the root rather than add emotion to it...it&apos;s almost as non-emotion-adding as playing a note and an octave above it (which doesn&apos;t really change the mood at all and simply alters the &quot;timbre&quot; of the root tone by stacking a much louder first overtone on top of it&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;the improvements these systems offer (in a 5-limit context) over 12-tone ET are utterly negligible. &quot;<br/>&gt;    Right, 12TET is at most about 13-cents off, which isn&apos;t noticeable to most people.  But one thing that IS very hard to use in 12TET in chords is consecutive minor seconds.  Why?  Because (look at Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s curves) critical dissonance peaks at about 1.05 and the minor second in 12TET is 1.05999 (pretty lousy interval for chords)!  So I say to hell with that &quot;standard&quot; and use 13/12 and 12/11 as a new type of minor second and find (GASP!) that I can finally make chords that are considered illegal in 12TET using minor seconds work.  Aha...something new!   In the meantime most all other intervals in the scale are within 13 cents of pure.  Aha...new advantage with little disadvantage...I figure, why would many musicians not be able to appreciate such an option?<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;All you&apos;ve succeeded in doing is making the zombie PRETTIER.&quot;<br/>&gt;    For several types of purifications, I actually agree with you.  But look closely at what people like Sethares, myself, and Erv Wilson are doing.  We are often using intervals not present in common practice.<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;but only a HANDFUL have been willing to give up 3/2 as the basis for music.&quot;<br/>&gt;   Same goes for that, none of said above people use 3/2 and the &quot;circle of fifths&quot; as the basis. Ptolemy used tetra-chords instead of circles.  I actually like even Ptolemy&apos;s early systems much better than Pythagorus&apos;s.<br/>&gt;   Heck, I refuse to use the circle of thirds, fourths, etc. either.  My PHI and Silver scales were defined by sections, not exponential powers of an interval over 2^x (octaves).  My new scales are defined by both sections and super-particular symmetries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;And all this talk about mathematical evaluations of consonance..<br/>&gt; .please. What are you gonna use it for, REALLY? You can call up any<br/>&gt; scale and hear how it sounds immediately with free computer software,<br/>&gt; so your EARS can tell you perfectly well whether something sounds<br/>&gt; consonant. WHY do you need a mathematical description? I just don&apos;t get<br/>&gt; it.&quot;<br/>&gt;    This is the one thing I actually don&apos;t agree with.  Agreed it&apos;s VERY easy to find the consonance of any given dyad...that&apos;s what Plomp and Llevelt accomplished ages ago with their dissonance curve.  But, guess what...a scale can have any COMBINATION of intervals.  Want all possible intervals far enough to be recognizable to the ear as different?  Try counting them 1.005 1.010 1.015...thousands if not millions of them!<br/>&gt;        And if you have 3 notes in the scale, you have 3 possible dyads, not too bad.  5 notes?  Try more like 10.  12 notes?  Don&apos;t ask.  And guess what...if you purify one interval, you can easily make 4 of the others go sour...often more than 13 cents sour and to the point it&apos;s notice-able.   You can compare all notes to all other notes as sets of dyads using a computer program...that&apos;s exactly what Sethares did.  But even he neglected the fact that chords have an added factor: they often produce sound-waves that don&apos;t repeat and this repeating produces a second type of &quot;periodic&quot; dissonance.  So 1.1066 may sound fine to you as a single note but not in a chord.   If you look up how mp3&apos;s are compressed they use temporal masking and ignore sound changes that happen within a tenth of a second.  Guess what happens when your precious chord doesn&apos;t repeat/isn&apos;t-periodic-at every 10th of a second or less?  Your ear has trouble processing it, regardless of<br/>&gt;  how well each interval works by itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     And such, consonance because an &quot;optimization&quot; game with not one but several factors...all of which have a habit of breaking a leak in one place when you patch another.  That&apos;s what makes it such a challenge.  What I think is cool about micro-tonality is that if you can &quot;hack&quot; that, you can open up chords and intervals to work that just weren&apos;t there before without killing everything else to make them work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    12TET is fine for common practice music, IMVHO.

Which is understandable, but - a large part of the<br/>question I&apos;ve been asking is exactly why 12-tet is such a great tuning.&quot;</p><p>     Ok, here goes again for &quot;what&apos;s good about 12TET&quot;<br/>1) Modulation and transposition is &quot;perfect&quot;...each interval stays constant in every key.  Though this is true of all TET tunings.<br/>2)  All common practice intervals are within about 13 cents of perfect...typically close enough to be un-noticeable to the untrained ear.  In tests between 1/4 comma meantone and JI, both in theory more pure than 12TET, 12TET often does almost as well as the other two.<br/>3)  No note functions much stronger as a tonic than any other giving a very balanced feel and this helps musicians know what to expect far as purity of a chord regardless of the tonic used, making composition easier for many if not most.<br/>4) 12 notes per octave are relatively easy to fit on instruments and play<br/>--------all in all it&apos;s very good for most common practice music...but not beyond.<br/>*******************************************<br/>.....and now for a few of the things I hate about 12TET<br/>1) Virtually all the chord progressions available with common-practice intervals in 12TET have been exhausted over the hundreds of years.<br/>2) Same goes with melodic progressions (not counting phrasing and non-tuning-related issues used for composition).  True, you can get some extra leverage by, say, making scales with the 5th and not the octave as the repeating interval.   But still, give me some new melodic intervals after these 200+ years of 12TET (for crying out loud)... :-)<br/>3) The fact small but not extremely small intervals like 11/10,12/11,13/12 are missed by over 13 cents and this gives rise to an inability to approach the idea of making more consonant/&quot;legal&quot; clustered chords...12TET has a dissonant and often harmonically/chord-wise hard to use half-step around 18/17 and leaves you stuck with it.<br/>4)  12TET has many sour spots often due to the problem expressed in #3...which actually creates a nasty learning curve for it as there are so many un-usable (to most musicians&apos; taste) terribly sour chords possible it forces musicians to memorize hundred of &quot;right&quot; chords instead of, say, just a few possible &quot;wrong&quot; ones to avoid with all the rest sounding anywhere from ok to great.  To me the fact music chord theory can take so many years to learn says something is a bit irrational about many parts of the 12TET system that it requires musicians to &quot;patch&quot; it by avoiding so many parts of it to sound confident and &quot;in key&quot;.<br/>5)  Transposed scales under the 12TET tuning may not be such an advantage  when you can, say, digitally pitch-shift the result of an instrument even in real-time (especially in case of keyboards) or use a fret-less or many wind instruments...and get an infinite number of perfect extra transpositions instead of 11 of them.  Technology often allows us to cut straight through the &quot;only TET tunings allow perfect transpositions&quot; limit...there seems much less need to obsess about a tuning&apos;s ability to transpose.</p><p>__,_._,__</p></div><h3><a id=87486 href="#87486">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2010 11:10:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene.  I figured you&apos;d be one of the people most likely to take umbrage with my post, so let&apos;s talk.  But first let me establish that I do deeply respect you, your work, and your knowledge of tuning theory.  You&apos;ve been at it a long time, and are a long-standing and well-respected member of this community, so I don&apos;t want to incite too much of your rancor.  My point of view is not a common one, nor is my musical background, so really I&apos;m just trying to keep this discussion from being too one-sided.</p><p>&gt;(regarding music retuned to eliminate the tonic-dominant relationship)<br/>&gt; Of course, the music is now not the same music, and fails to achieve the same effect. &gt;Could it be this is just another form of the search for the &quot;perfect&quot; scale?</p><p>Okay, first of all: I have no interest in &quot;retuning&quot; existing music, especially to such a drastic degree.  Occasionally on a lark it can be a fun endeavor, but I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything to be gained except a satisfaction of some idle curiosity.  To date I have retuned ONE piece of music, a surf-rock song called &quot;Pipeline&quot;, and that was just for shits&apos;n&apos;giggles.  Writing NEW music is the only thing that really concerns me.  SO: Is this another form of the search for the perfect scale?  Well, NO.  It&apos;s a search for ANY scale that forces the composer to take a completely novel approach, not merely to &quot;add on&quot; to or &quot;modify&quot; the age-old common practice.</p><p>&gt; So transform your music into a mavilla version, and perform it with sixteen equal steps &gt;to the octave and not twelve.

And truth be told, I can&apos;t say I prefer the JI.  I&apos;ve listened to most of the retuned music that gets posted here, and (especially in the case of Drei Equale) I frankly prefer the 12.  I don&apos;t like having more than a couple Just intervals in a tuning because I find that slight beating gives the sound &quot;life&quot;, and helps chords sound distinct instead of blurring into a harmonic wall.</p><p>&gt; Depends on the style of music, but personally I think it sounds fairly rancid even with &quot;At &gt; the Hop&quot;, not to mention &quot;Missa Tu es Petrus.&quot; For other styles of music, not so big a &gt;deal.</p><p>Well, you&apos;ve got a sharper ear than probably 95% of humanity, me included.  So I won&apos;t begrudge you your JI retunements...if I was that sensitive to temperament, I&apos;d probably be retuning things like mad, too.  But please recognize that your sensitivity is an exception, not the rule...elsewise we&apos;d never have had temperament in the first place!</p><p>&gt;&gt;Bohlen and Pierce had the right idea but maybe not the right scale (though I&apos;ll take &gt;&gt;13-EDT over 19-EDO any day).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s an interesting concept. The results, in my opinion, not so much. I think higher limit &gt;harmony WITH 2 and 3 is far more interesting, but then I write in systems like octoid &gt;temperament, which most people feel involves too many notes.</p><p>Like I said: right idea, maybe not the right scale.  Erlich&apos;s triple-BP is much better, though I still don&apos;t find 3:5:7 a good basis for tonality.  Even 11:13:15 works better.</p><p>&gt; Blah blah blah.

I (for one) have fairly trained ears and I can tell the difference between a pure and 13-cent un-pure 5th fairly well and, even though it&apos;s not important to me, I can appreciate the works of those who tweak that sort of thing sort long as they don&apos;t call me &quot;psycho or un-educated&quot; for working on developing totally different sorts on scales and tunings. ;-)<br/>    Marcel and John on this list I believe have made great strides in &quot;making a prettier zombie&quot; from common practice music interval-based scales (lol).   I&apos;m happy they are doing so because even though I can&apos;t use that type of improvement much, I realize many other musicians can.<br/>     And, hey...it&apos;s the least I can do as I hope they will help me with suggestions for my &quot;crazy scales&quot;, which they can argue has frighteningly little historical basis to justify it just as easily as I could say &quot;this is so much like history it&apos;s not moving forward&quot;.   I may even say &quot;I don&apos;t see much of a point in it myself&quot; and, at the same time, say &quot;I support it anyhow because I see it&apos;s improving toward its goal and think others could still find it useful&quot;.</p><p>     Point is...whether it&apos;s useful for US or not...if people are finding a use for it IMVHO, it definitely still deserves support to be developed further.  Even if guys like us both whole-heartedly agree it&apos;s not the sort of thing we&apos;d be interested in using for our own songs....</p></div><h3><a id=87488 href="#87488">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/15/2010 11:26:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t like having more than a couple Just intervals in a tuning<br/>because I find that slight beating gives the sound &quot;life&quot;, and helps<br/>chords sound distinct instead of blurring into a harmonic wall.&quot;</p><p>    Interesting point....what I think you may be hearing is &quot;periodicity buzz&quot; caused by stacked intervals often low in the harmonic series IE 7:8:9:10.

To me the sense of shifting to different root or virtual tones can imply tonal depth just as well as dissonance can, but without the difficulties.  Even taking a note out of a chord can make a different root tone (or tones!) implied.  The sad thing is that many consonant scales seem to fall into the trap of referencing just a handful of possible root tones, especially those with only three small interval sizes or less (IE diatonic JI has 3, MOS has 2).</p><p>      Things like 11TET (which you mentioned) are interesting because they hit cool semi-periodic intervals that don&apos;t exist in Western music, like 1.37035, which nears the non-common-practice 11-limit interval of 11/8.  But heck, Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scale also uses 11/8.  And 11/10.  And many other intervals that hint at weird and new root tones.  My point is many of these &quot;dissonant&quot; intervals you love can be rounded to &quot;consonant&quot; approximations without losing their feel and/or the characteristic of sounding completely unlike 12TET.</p><p>      Actually I very much like how 11TET and 10TET sound using sine waves...but the grating of overtone dissonance gets to me because I have trouble telling where the root tones are (IE even though there are many new beautiful ones implied, they are all covered by &quot;muck&quot;).  Maybe your brain can parse through that muck better than most of ours...who knows.  Anyhow, I think 10 and 11TET can be public accessible IF spectral alignment (ALA Sethares) is used to resolve these clashing overtones...the root tones in 10 and 11TET themselves have a lot of interesting potential.  Even with &quot;Setharesian&quot; alignment though, you still have lack of periodicity distorting the sense of tones a bit (though much less)...and my personal opinion is why not try for a cool new scale with those non-standard intervals that has better periodicity?</p><p>&gt;&quot;I just prefer to avoid the theoretical maxima of consonance in favor<br/>of lower-level intervals.  I&apos;ll take 21/16 to 4/3 any day of the week!&quot;<br/>On the note 27/25 is one of my favorite intervals.  And, actually 21/16 is very near 17/13 and not far at all from 13/10...so &quot;even&quot; it isn&apos;t that anti-periodic or &quot;JI-unfittable&quot;.  One of my favorite techniques is to try to find fairly periodic intervals that point to the same more complex root tone patterns that scales like the TET temperaments you like imply.</p></div><h3><a id=87513 href="#87513">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2010 10:31:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;I assume that you aren&apos;t saying that Quarter-comma<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; meantone is superior to 31-tet (but that what it seems like).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh but I am saying that.

You always have something helpful to add.  As to 11:13:15, I intend to explore it more in-depth in the coming months, once I have a 20-EDO guitar at my disposal.  In 20, as Dan Stearns pointed out to me, there is a 9-note MOS of 2 3 2 2 2 2 3 2 2, or 0-120-300-420-540-660-780-960-1080-1200, which is based on a chain of 11:15&apos;s and consistently (if imperfectly) approximates 11:13:15 (though I believe it can also be seen to approximate 11:14:16 about as well).

In 20, as Dan Stearns pointed out to me, there is a 9-note MOS of 2 3 2 2 2 2 3 2 2, or 0-120-300-420-540-660-780-960-1080-1200, which is based on a chain of 11:15&apos;s and consistently (if imperfectly) approximates 11:13:15 (though I believe it can also be seen to approximate 11:14:16 about as well).

But still, give me some new melodic intervals after<br/>&gt; these 200+ years of 12TET (for crying out loud)... :-)<br/>&gt; 3) The fact small but not extremely small intervals like 11/10,12/11,13/12<br/>&gt; are missed by over 13 cents and this gives rise to an inability to approach<br/>&gt; the idea of making more consonant/&quot;legal&quot; clustered chords...12TET has a<br/>&gt; dissonant and often harmonically/chord-wise hard to use half-step around<br/>&gt; 18/17 and leaves you stuck with it.<br/>&gt; 4)  12TET has many sour spots often due to the problem expressed in<br/>&gt; #3...which actually creates a nasty learning curve for it as there are so<br/>&gt; many un-usable (to most musicians&apos; taste) terribly sour chords possible it<br/>&gt; forces musicians to memorize hundred of &quot;right&quot; chords instead of, say, just<br/>&gt; a few possible &quot;wrong&quot; ones to avoid with all the rest sounding anywhere<br/>&gt; from ok to great.  To me the fact music chord theory can take so many years<br/>&gt; to learn says something is a bit irrational about many parts of the 12TET<br/>&gt; system that it requires musicians to &quot;patch&quot; it by avoiding so many parts of<br/>&gt; it to sound confident and &quot;in key&quot;.<br/>&gt; 5)  Transposed scales under the 12TET tuning may not be such an advantage<br/>&gt; when you can, say, digitally pitch-shift the result of an instrument even in<br/>&gt; real-time (especially in case of keyboards) or use a fret-less or many wind<br/>&gt; instruments...and get an infinite number of perfect extra transpositions<br/>&gt; instead of 11 of them.  Technology often allows us to cut straight through<br/>&gt; the &quot;only TET tunings allow perfect transpositions&quot; limit...there seems much<br/>&gt; less need to obsess about a tuning&apos;s ability to transpose.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; __,_._,__<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=87538 href="#87538">ðŸ”—</a>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2010 3:00:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; According to me, 11:13:15 is best served by &lt;201 215 227],<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; which you can get in 58-ET.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; -Carl<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Take a closer look, and you&apos;ll see that 11:13:15 in 29-ET and<br/>&gt; &gt; 58-ET are exactly the same, hence the result will sound exactly<br/>&gt; &gt; alike.

In JI you have to navigate commas, which I think makes this<br/>&gt; harmonic style harder to use and less seamless, and to my ear I like a<br/>&gt; favoring of the 3 limit over the 5 limit because their more accurate tuning<br/>&gt; puts them on a more even level with the more familiar 5-limit triadic<br/>&gt; harmonies.

Though this is true of all TET tunings.<br/>&gt; &gt; 2)  All common practice intervals are within about 13 cents of<br/>&gt; &gt; perfect...typically close enough to be un-noticeable to the untrained ear.<br/>&gt; &gt; In tests between 1/4 comma meantone and JI, both in theory more pure than<br/>&gt; &gt; 12TET, 12TET often does almost as well as the other two.<br/>&gt; &gt; 3)  No note functions much stronger as a tonic than any other giving a very<br/>&gt; &gt; balanced feel and this helps musicians know what to expect far as purity of<br/>&gt; &gt; a chord regardless of the tonic used, making composition easier for many if<br/>&gt; &gt; not most.<br/>&gt; &gt; 4) 12 notes per octave are relatively easy to fit on instruments and play<br/>&gt; &gt; --------all in all it&apos;s very good for most common practice music...but not<br/>&gt; &gt; beyond.<br/>&gt; &gt; *******************************************<br/>&gt; &gt; .....and now for a few of the things I hate about 12TET<br/>&gt; &gt; 1) Virtually all the chord progressions available with common-practice<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals in 12TET have been exhausted over the hundreds of years.<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) Same goes with melodic progressions (not counting phrasing and<br/>&gt; &gt; non-tuning-related issues used for composition).  True, you can get some<br/>&gt; &gt; extra leverage by, say, making scales with the 5th and not the octave as the<br/>&gt; &gt; repeating interval.   But still, give me some new melodic intervals after<br/>&gt; &gt; these 200+ years of 12TET (for crying out loud)... :-)<br/>&gt; &gt; 3) The fact small but not extremely small intervals like 11/10,12/11,13/12<br/>&gt; &gt; are missed by over 13 cents and this gives rise to an inability to approach<br/>&gt; &gt; the idea of making more consonant/&quot;legal&quot; clustered chords...12TET has a<br/>&gt; &gt; dissonant and often harmonically/chord-wise hard to use half-step around<br/>&gt; &gt; 18/17 and leaves you stuck with it.<br/>&gt; &gt; 4)  12TET has many sour spots often due to the problem expressed in<br/>&gt; &gt; #3...which actually creates a nasty learning curve for it as there are so<br/>&gt; &gt; many un-usable (to most musicians&apos; taste) terribly sour chords possible it<br/>&gt; &gt; forces musicians to memorize hundred of &quot;right&quot; chords instead of, say, just<br/>&gt; &gt; a few possible &quot;wrong&quot; ones to avoid with all the rest sounding anywhere<br/>&gt; &gt; from ok to great.  To me the fact music chord theory can take so many years<br/>&gt; &gt; to learn says something is a bit irrational about many parts of the 12TET<br/>&gt; &gt; system that it requires musicians to &quot;patch&quot; it by avoiding so many parts of<br/>&gt; &gt; it to sound confident and &quot;in key&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; 5)  Transposed scales under the 12TET tuning may not be such an advantage<br/>&gt; &gt; when you can, say, digitally pitch-shift the result of an instrument even in<br/>&gt; &gt; real-time (especially in case of keyboards) or use a fret-less or many wind<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments...and get an infinite number of perfect extra transpositions<br/>&gt; &gt; instead of 11 of them.

To me the fact music chord theory can take so many years<br/>&gt; &gt; to learn says something is a bit irrational about many parts of the 12TET<br/>&gt; &gt; system that it requires musicians to &quot;patch&quot; it by avoiding so many parts of<br/>&gt; &gt; it to sound confident and &quot;in key&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; 5)  Transposed scales under the 12TET tuning may not be such an advantage<br/>&gt; &gt; when you can, say, digitally pitch-shift the result of an instrument even in<br/>&gt; &gt; real-time (especially in case of keyboards) or use a fret-less or many wind<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments. ..and get an infinite number of perfect extra transpositions<br/>&gt; &gt; instead of 11 of them.

To me the fact music chord theory can take so many years<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to learn says something is a bit irrational about many parts of the 12TET<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; system that it requires musicians to &quot;patch&quot; it by avoiding so many parts of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it to sound confident and &quot;in key&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5)  Transposed scales under the 12TET tuning may not be such an advantage<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; when you can, say, digitally pitch-shift the result of an instrument even in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; real-time (especially in case of keyboards) or use a fret-less or many wind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instruments. ..and get an infinite number of perfect extra transpositions<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of 11 of them.  Technology often allows us to cut straight through<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;only TET tunings allow perfect transpositions&quot; limit...there seems much<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; less need to obsess about a tuning&apos;s ability to transpose.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; __,_._,__<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=87570 href="#87570">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2010 5:44:56 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;We&apos;re not discussing historic tuning systems, but fundamental concepts.<br/>Over at the .ning I&apos;ve got chromatic pieces in 14-root-of-7/ 4, 18<br/>unequal geometrical divisions of Pi, and 23-edo.

That&apos;s 10/9*10/9 = 100/81 (the Syntonic Comma), but I round it the 10/9 * 10/9 to 16/13 (the comma does not pop up in a triad).  Plus, as you seem to have said, comma shifts aren&apos;t always that notice-able and sometimes you, for example, may actually want to use them on purpose to make &quot;wolf&quot; intervals.</p><p>   Now how does this have to have anything to do with triads or, more specifically, how 12TET handles triads vs. other scale systems?   To me a comma is just another type of interval that&apos;s not as &quot;just&quot; as you&apos;d like it to be that sometimes (but not always!) comes when you purify one interval and it hurts the purity of another interval.  Also, I know the 12TET major 3rd is not a &quot;comma&quot;, but it is off-just enough to sound like a comma to some.</p></div><h3><a id=87573 href="#87573">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2010 8:06:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And by the way 1/4 comma meantone is not really based on a fifth, but on the fourth root of 5.

For example, when you say:</p><p>Regular temperaments are a lot like JI. If you look at 11-limit JI, it has five generators, which you can take to be 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11. It is of rank five. Breed temperament has three generators, which you can take to be, exactly or approximately, 2, 49/40 and 10/7, and so it is of rank three. Marvel temperament has three generators, which you can take to be 2 and slightly flattened 3 and 5; hence it looks the same as 5-limit JI.</p><p>Special among all of these are those of ranks one and two.

I&apos;d be interested to know if anyone has followed up on Wilson&apos;s suggestion and made any music based on an 11:13:15 tonality?</p><p>about that scale, see this</p><p><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/82417">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/82417</a></p><p>Kalle Aho</p></div><h3><a id=87582 href="#87582">ðŸ”—</a>Cody Hallenbeck &#x3C;codyhallenbeck@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2010 11:45:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wasn&apos;t arguing that commas were a &quot;problem&quot; per se in JI.

Having<br/>commas tempered out provides a different and interesting set of musical<br/>resources, and in 12EDO I happen to really enjoy that it tempers out the<br/>syntonic comma, and being on the 3-limit favoring side of the meantone<br/>temperament class it readily allows the free use of quartal harmonies,<br/>whereas in, say, 1/4 meantone I perceive the 3-limit as being too<br/>compromised for stacked quartal/quintal harmony. Being a product of<br/>mainsteam music education, I have a lot of familiarity with 12EDO quirkier<br/>possibilities, and I&apos;ve also been spending more time working with JI.<br/>Temperament classes not represented by 12EDO offer really exciting<br/>possibilities, but working out the details of composing in extended JI could<br/>take up all my time and mental resources if I wanted it to as it is.

In addition to the obvious endless<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; modulation and small cardinality for an recognizable 5-limit harmony, I<br/>&gt; like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; how quartal/quintal harmony in 12EDO blends so seamlessly with 5-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; triadic harmony.

Though this is true of all TET tunings.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) All common practice intervals are within about 13 cents of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfect...typically close enough to be un-noticeable to the untrained<br/>&gt; ear.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In tests between 1/4 comma meantone and JI, both in theory more pure<br/>&gt; than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 12TET, 12TET often does almost as well as the other two.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) No note functions much stronger as a tonic than any other giving a<br/>&gt; very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; balanced feel and this helps musicians know what to expect far as<br/>&gt; purity of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a chord regardless of the tonic used, making composition easier for<br/>&gt; many if<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not most.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4) 12 notes per octave are relatively easy to fit on instruments and<br/>&gt; play<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------all in all it&apos;s very good for most common practice<br/>&gt; music...but not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beyond.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ************ ********* ********* ********* ****<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .....and now for a few of the things I hate about 12TET<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Virtually all the chord progressions available with<br/>&gt; common-practice<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intervals in 12TET have been exhausted over the hundreds of years.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Same goes with melodic progressions (not counting phrasing and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; non-tuning-related issues used for composition) . True, you can get<br/>&gt; some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extra leverage by, say, making scales with the 5th and not the octave<br/>&gt; as the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; repeating interval. But still, give me some new melodic intervals<br/>&gt; after<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these 200+ years of 12TET (for crying out loud)... :-)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) The fact small but not extremely small intervals like 11/10,12/11,<br/>&gt; 13/12<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are missed by over 13 cents and this gives rise to an inability to<br/>&gt; approach<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the idea of making more consonant/&quot;legal&quot; clustered chords...12TET<br/>&gt; has a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dissonant and often harmonically/ chord-wise hard to use half-step<br/>&gt; around<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 18/17 and leaves you stuck with it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4) 12TET has many sour spots often due to the problem expressed in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; #3...which actually creates a nasty learning curve for it as there<br/>&gt; are so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many un-usable (to most musicians&apos; taste) terribly sour chords<br/>&gt; possible it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forces musicians to memorize hundred of &quot;right&quot; chords instead of,<br/>&gt; say, just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a few possible &quot;wrong&quot; ones to avoid with all the rest sounding<br/>&gt; anywhere<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from ok to great. To me the fact music chord theory can take so many<br/>&gt; years<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to learn says something is a bit irrational about many parts of the<br/>&gt; 12TET<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; system that it requires musicians to &quot;patch&quot; it by avoiding so many<br/>&gt; parts of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it to sound confident and &quot;in key&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5) Transposed scales under the 12TET tuning may not be such an<br/>&gt; advantage<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when you can, say, digitally pitch-shift the result of an instrument<br/>&gt; even in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; real-time (especially in case of keyboards) or use a fret-less or<br/>&gt; many wind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instruments. ..and get an infinite number of perfect extra<br/>&gt; transpositions<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of 11 of them.

Especially on a guitar.  It&apos;s perfectly symmetric, every position yields a consonant tetrad, and depending on the metatuning it can be very harmonically consonant.  It maintains &quot;simple&quot; common-practice progressions (like I-IV-V) but totally destroys more complex ones, and it sounds tonal even though it lacks a tonic.  It&apos;s great for rock and blues because every chord has both fifth and a harmonic seventh, but there are still major and minor seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths (though in decatonic terms they&apos;d be &quot;seconds, fourths, eighths, and tenths&quot;), so there is plenty of harmonic variety.  Yeah, it&apos;s no good for common-practice music because the &quot;tonal gravity&quot; just isn&apos;t there...but so what?  It&apos;s fun, like playing in zero gravity.</p><p>Honestly, on a guitar, you won&apos;t FIND an easier scale without greatly sacrificing harmonic and melodic resources.  The scale has the same fingering on every string in every position--there are only two modes (major and minor) and on a 20-EDO guitar there only 4 keys of each mode.  Yet for all its simplicity it is rich in complexity, because you can make some really complex chords...consider that in the 15-EDO version, in all the major positions, you can add both a major seventh AND a harmonic dominant seventh, and either a septimal major ninth or an undecimal neutral ninth.  Do you see why I love this scale so much?

I just hope those values are &gt;reduce-able to something with 14-cents or so of an x/11 or lower (IE x/10) type fraction &gt;since having a reliable ratio to use about a 5th away is such a huge deal in things like &gt;arpeggios.  Something within 14 cents or so 16/11 or 17/11 (or, of course, within 14 cents &gt;of 3/2) wouldn&apos;t be too bad for the &quot;public ear&quot;.</p><p>Well, sadly, unlike most temperaments the &quot;fifth&quot; of Blackwood is not subject to variation.  This is because the period of Blackwood is 1/5 of an octave, i.e. 240 cents, and the generator is pretty much any interval less than 240 cents.  So the fifth is firmly entrenched at 720 cents--3/5 of an octave--i.e. around 50/33; but it is because of this that Blackwood obtains all its useful properties.  For instance, the &quot;fourth&quot; at 480 cents, because it is exactly 2/5 of an octave, is also 1/5 of two octaves; on a guitar, this means that you can tune all the open strings 480 cents apart and the highest and lowest strings will be two octaves apart.  This is what allows for the greatly simplified fingerings.  Honestly, it&apos;s not really a problem to my ears.  3/2 is such a strong interval that it can survive a fair amount of mistuning; and playing chords in alternate inversions seems to lessen the beating significantly.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested, I&apos;d suggest reading my paper on 5n-EDOs for comparisons of the harmonic and melodic properties of different Blackwood-compatible metatunings.  For instance, 25 has near-Just (within 2 cents) 5/4 major thirds, 15 has near-Just (within 5 cents) 6/5 minor thirds, but 20 has the best melodic properties because its semitone is 1/3 the size of its whole tone (at 60 and 180 cents, respectively).  Actually, a mathematically-ideal Blackwood scale that averages out the dissonance of the major &amp; minor thirds would have a minor third of 325&cent; and a major third of 395&cent;, giving a semitone of 85&cent; and a whole tone of 155&cent;, so a subset of either 70-EDO or 100-EDO could be used...though I don&apos;t see this as much of an improvement over 15-EDO.</p></div><h3><a id=87608 href="#87608">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2010 8:06:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;About the limited, the 6-limit harmonic model results from all the<br/>permutations of the harmonic series up to the 6th harmonic (6-limit)<br/>The 7-limit harmonic model results from all the permutations of the harmonic series up to the 7th harmonic (7-limit)<br/>Get it?

In JI you have to navigate commas, which I think makes this<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic style harder to use and less seamless, and to my ear I like a<br/>&gt; &gt; favoring of the 3 limit over the 5 limit because their more accurate tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; puts them on a more even level with the more familiar 5-limit triadic<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonies.

True, you can get some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; extra leverage by, say, making scales with the 5th and not the octave as the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; repeating interval.   But still, give me some new melodic intervals after<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; these 200+ years of 12TET (for crying out loud)... :-)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) The fact small but not extremely small intervals like 11/10,12/11,13/12<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; are missed by over 13 cents and this gives rise to an inability to approach<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the idea of making more consonant/&quot;legal&quot; clustered chords...12TET has a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; dissonant and often harmonically/chord-wise hard to use half-step around<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 18/17 and leaves you stuck with it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4)  12TET has many sour spots often due to the problem expressed in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; #3...which actually creates a nasty learning curve for it as there are so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; many un-usable (to most musicians&apos; taste) terribly sour chords possible it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; forces musicians to memorize hundred of &quot;right&quot; chords instead of, say, just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a few possible &quot;wrong&quot; ones to avoid with all the rest sounding anywhere<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; from ok to great.  To me the fact music chord theory can take so many years<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to learn says something is a bit irrational about many parts of the 12TET<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; system that it requires musicians to &quot;patch&quot; it by avoiding so many parts of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it to sound confident and &quot;in key&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5)  Transposed scales under the 12TET tuning may not be such an advantage<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; when you can, say, digitally pitch-shift the result of an instrument even in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; real-time (especially in case of keyboards) or use a fret-less or many wind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instruments...and get an infinite number of perfect extra transpositions<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of 11 of them.

I don&apos;t take it &gt;seriously<br/>&gt; because it&apos;s obviously wrong.</p><p>It&apos;s not obviously wrong from the &quot;outside&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If you explain that regular temperaments function as efficient<br/>&gt; &gt; modalities of numerous large equal divisions, the objection of<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;too many notes&quot; suddenly loses ground.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The objection should have lost ground when I listed 10 notes.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t suffice because it looks like a scale, which people are going to assume is part of a larger system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Miracle temperament functions as an efficient modality of 31, 41<br/>&gt; &gt; and 72 note equal temperaments. It can be applied to these<br/>&gt; &gt; equal divisions as a relatively small subset or extended, maintaining<br/>&gt; &gt; its structure and regular mapping throughout&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Great.  What does it mean?</p><p>I can&apos;t put it any more succinctly and clearly than that. You can<br/>see how a regular temperament functions as a modality, imposes a particular rhyme and reason, and surely you agree that it is efficient, that&apos;s what the &quot;regular&quot; part means.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The tempering out of commas also implies modalities, by the way.<br/>&gt; &gt; A random walk through the pitches wouldn&apos;t really temper out<br/>&gt; &gt; anything except on paper.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does it?  That&apos;s nice!  So what is it that unison vectors imply and<br/>&gt; that we haven&apos;t talked about here?</p><p>I don&apos;t get that.

Marvel temperament has three generators, which you can take to be 2 and slightly flattened 3 and 5; hence it looks the same as 5-limit JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Special among all of these are those of ranks one and two. A rank one temperament has one generator, and is usually called an equal division of the octave. A rank two, &quot;linear&quot;, temperament like meantone or miracle tends to involve MOS scales and can be represented in terms of a rank one temperament, and this seems to be what you are talking about.

The objection was my first reaction,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &Acirc; and I find that it is the normal reaction of practicing musicians<br/>out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; here in the physical world. So I wasn&apos;t surprised to find it spelled<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; out by Kyle Gann:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.kylegann.com/JIreasons.html">http://www.kylegann.com/JIreasons.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (see reason 1 and the penultimate paragraph)</p><p>I&apos;ve read this before, and am now reading it again now that I understand<br/>more about all of this. But I strongly disagree with this:</p><p>&quot;3. I have never liked the concept of transposability, which is considered<br/>by many the primary virtue of equal temperaments. I don&apos;t like the way (and<br/>noticed this even as a child), in some of Mozart&apos;s piano sonatas, the second<br/>theme sounds so perfectly placed as to register in the exposition, and then<br/>when it&apos;s transposed a fourth up or a fifth down in the recap, it doesn&apos;t<br/>sound as good. I&apos;ve always instinctively agreed with Dane Rudhyar that to<br/>transpose a sonority is to diminish its absolute value as a sonic phenomenon<br/>and reduce it to a set of relationships.&quot;</p><p>That&apos;s absurd. Kyle sounds like someone who has AP. I have AP as well and I<br/>have to tell you that to take a piece of music and transpose it can either<br/>be extremely annoying or life-changingly awesome. That&apos;s like saying that<br/>you don&apos;t like artistic renditions of the sky in any color but blue, because<br/>only blue captures the real &quot;essence&quot; of the sky, and painting a green alien<br/>sky just reduces it to saturation and value relationships, thus removing the<br/>chroma.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s what it&apos;s like to transpose a piece of music for someone with<br/>AP. You take a piece that sounds like &quot;daytime&quot; or &quot;blue&quot; or whatever, and<br/>then you transpose it and suddenly it&apos;s &quot;night time&quot; or &quot;red&apos; or &quot;purple&quot; or<br/>whatever. What&apos;s wrong with that?</p><p>I have this theory that people who don&apos;t have AP sometimes try to &quot;fake it&quot;<br/>by coming up with stuff like the above. Maybe Kyle Gann does have AP, but I<br/>don&apos;t understand why he&apos;s so intolerant to transposition then.

So where ever did you get the impression that I said all (when in fact the most extreme words I use on these forums are things like &quot;most&quot; and I do not resort to absolutes such as &quot;all&quot;)?<br/>    The other thing is there are tons of tetrad-based-chords....and I never said the word tetrad...I said chords with a semi-tone; and we both know there are exponentially less chords using semi-tones than tetrad-based chords.  It&apos;s a whole different ballgame.</p><p>    Example...when I learned music, I learned by things like taking tablature and midi files for pop and rock songs.  Rarely did I see things like half steps held as chords in those types of music.  And when I use things like 13th chords in pop songs, people complain its<br/>too dissonant...but when I realize similar progressions in jazz or<br/>classical style songs far more people are open to them.</p><p>    And, of course, I know the concept of using half-steps in chords has been around for a good while, it just doesn&apos;t seem to have enjoyed much popularity (hey, same thing goes with micro-tonal music , which has been around longer than 12TET has and IE much harmonic music is not 12TET through history...it&apos;s just such music has not kept popularity).  See the difference?<br/>     Kalle gave a few good examples of artists like Stevie Wonder and Cole Porter who use such chords and are not as directly in more &quot;academic&quot; genres like jazz, blues, or classical and can be considered by some as popularizing their use.  Then again you can easily argue Stevie is on the jazzy side of R&amp;B and has performed at several jazz fests.  Meanwhile Cole Porter (though I&apos;m no expert on him) appears to have wrote mostly broad-way scores and has been remixed by musicians such as Ella Fitzgerald .   I assume most people would consider his style of music generally more &quot;academic&quot; than pop, even if he has a few songs like &quot;Don&apos;t Fence Me In&quot; (which even I&apos;ve heard) which aren&apos;t Broadway-ish at all.</p><p>    I am not saying that there is anything wrong with jazz, blues, classical or broad-way (some of the more academic genres, IMVHO) or that things like 13th chords can&apos;t be or haven&apos;t been used outside them.  But just noting the realistic sense that only a small proportion of people (maybe 10% or so) seem to be really into those sorts of music and perhaps mainly only those few have been able to champion such &quot;stretches&quot; of mean-tone theory under 12TET as &quot;odd&quot; chords that utilize the half-step.</p><p>    My point, again, is that while I believe use of such chords should not be stuck in use for more academic music, I hope it can manage to work its way into pop without a public reaction of &quot;it&apos;s way too dissonant&quot;.  And if songs written in 12TET can do well enough, great...but if not or if someone wants more half-step utilizing chords to be possible as acceptable as consonant in relatively &quot;non-academic&quot; genres, there is always the option of using a different interval size or sizes for the minor second via (gasp) micro-tonality! :-)</p></div><h3><a id=87626 href="#87626">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2010 8:51:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marcel&gt;&quot;27 is a normal number in JI, it&apos;s in 27/16, 32/27, 40/27, 27/20, 27/25,<br/>50/27.&quot;<br/>Many of these seems to be about a comma off a dominating periodic interval and not near any other interval.<br/>    For example 40/27 = 1.48148 (comes out as a sour 2/3) and 27/16 = 1.6875 which comes across to me as simply a slightly sour version of 22/13 = 1.692307 (not much difference) or even a 13-cent sour version of 17/10 (significantly more sour).<br/>    To me x/27 often cries (I&apos;m within about 12-20 cents of a much more periodic interval, why not just temper me to fit within 10 cents)?</p><p>&gt;&quot;As for it being not far enough away from 3/2 to be a different class... why would that be? You just made that rule up, and it&apos;s wrong. &quot;<br/>  I was referencing it&apos;s ability to have a significantly different feel than 3/2...and I didn&apos;t &quot;make it up&quot;...I suspected it due to the lack of periodicity in an x/27 interval that can&apos;t be reduced, listened to it, and it indeed sounded off to my ears.  And that is coming from someone who has listened to intervals like 12/13 (certain dissonant to some) and noted them as OK.</p><p>   One way to test.   Try 16/11, which is one of the closer fractions to 3/2 with a denominator of 13 or lower.  Now try 3/2 and then 40/27.  At least to my ears alone it seems obvious that 16/11 has one sound, 3/2 has another, and 40/27 just seems to blur not-so-confidently between the two.  I&apos;m not saying x/27 is invalid, but I sense the error has to be a good bit less than of many of the dyadic intervals in your scale...more like 10 cents error instead of approaching 15-20 cents.  A good example of this....27/25 IMVHO is fine because it is within just a few cents of 13/12 (about 5.33 cents)...good enough...but many fractions using 27 are not and I think testing and looking through temperament options if your x/27 or 27/x form fraction falls around 15+ cents from the nearest x/13 or lower format fraction would likely help your scale.</p><p>&gt;&quot;No, it is not heard as a &quot;comma&quot;, as I said before, where the 40/27<br/>occurs, the 3/2 cannot, and the ear does not expect a 3/2 in those<br/>places.&quot;<br/>      I understand the ear does not see an &quot;imaginary&quot; 3/2 (as if it wants a 3/2 to appear) colliding with the 40/27.  But at the same time, that fraction still sounds utterly like a blue between an interval class at around 16/11 and the usual one at 3/2 it sounds...a bit confused to me.  And, to be clear, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a &quot;common practice&quot; or not issue, I think it&apos;s an issue purely of the physics phenomenon of periodicity.  Come to think of it...I think 1.545454 IE 17/11 would be another &quot;different tonal class of 5th&quot; alternative as (perhaps) would 23/15 and 22/15.   All of these options (at least to my ear) sound significantly more confident and expressive than the 40/27.</p><p>Me&gt;&quot;       If you look at<br/>&gt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_comma">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_comma</a><br/>&gt;&gt;(the Syntonic comma)   &quot;is a small interval between two musical &gt;notes, equal to the frequency ratio 81:80, or around 21.51 cents. Two notes that differ by this interval would sound<br/>&gt;different from each other even to untrained ears[1],<br/>&gt;but would be close enough that they would be more likely interpreted as<br/>&gt;out-of-tune versions of the same note than as different notes.&quot;<br/>&gt;-wikipedia&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>Marcel&gt;&quot;Well, there you go. even<br/>untrained ears will here it as a different sounding interval.&quot;<br/>    Can someone on the list please back me up here? :-)  Yes they say &quot;different&quot;, but then they quickly say &quot; they would be more likely interpreted as<br/>out-of-tune versions of the same note than as different notes.&quot;  That&apos;s what I&apos;m saying, they sound different, but not different enough to be of their own classes as different tones and thus end up simply sounding out-of-tune.</p><p>&gt;&quot;It&apos;s 12tet thinking and trying to convert every 12tet fifth to a 3/2<br/>fifth that&apos;s wrong thinking (and leads to out of tune tunings)&quot;<br/>  But, you see, the 12TET fifth is within 14 cents or so of the 3/2 fifth.  In fact it&apos;s 1.49831 and 1.5 / 1.49831 = 1.001127 or about 2 cents off (your ear isn&apos;t going to notice that tiny a difference)?  So to a huge majority of people&apos;s ears, the 12TET fifth is the 3/2 fifth, same interval class and everything.  My issue with your fifth is that it seems to fall into the gray area of &quot;not close enough to sound the same as a 3/2 fifth, but not far enough away to lock in to being near another interval (such as 16/11) and thus ending up sounding like a confused version of a tone wavering between two more periodically-stable interval classes.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Anyhow, if I&apos;m somehow wrong, then surely someone should be able to tune the drei equale better than me.<br/>As it&apos;s chock full of 40/27 and 27/20.&quot;<br/>      I&apos;ll take that as a challenge.  :-)  Just to make sure I get it right, though, what is the exact &quot;Drei Equale&quot; scale (I know you&apos;ve given several in your examples)?</p></div><h3><a id=87627 href="#87627">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2010 8:58:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Kyle Gann doesn&apos;t even discuss regular temperaments which are not &gt;equal divisions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regualr temperaments *are* NOT equal divisions.

I cut my guitar-playing teeth on that music, and I can assure you it&apos;s nowhere near that simple.  Most of the popular grunge bands used extended-voice chords rather frequently, even with their heavy distortion.  A random example: the song &quot;Come Down&quot; by Bush is based around a progression of B major-A major-F# major-G major, but with open high-E and B strings ringing throughout.  So that B major and F# major both have added fourths on top of their major thirds, and that F# also has a minor seventh.  A lot of alt-rock bands used those chords, actually.  Grunge bands like Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, and Soundgarden FREQUENTLY used seventh or added-sixth and ninth chords with lots of distortion, too.</p><p>Really, certain types of distortion work just fine with crazy chords--it&apos;s only the types that favor odd harmonics that cause clashing (like the Fuzzface or Octavia, and to a degree the Big Muff).  Even- or full-harmonic distortions (i.e. most overdriven amps) work just fine even with 12-tET&apos;s bad thirds and sixths.  I will grant, though, that today&apos;s &quot;alternative rock&quot; has almost entirely given up the musical prowess even of grunge bands and the power chord dominates in a BIG way.

It can be viewed<br/>as an expansion of VI-&gt;iv-&gt;i, except when the i chord is finally<br/>reached, the parallel Dorian mode is used as a substitute for the<br/>usual Aeolian mode. I&apos;ll let you create your own impression of what<br/>feelings and emotions that evokes, but here&apos;s the song:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GatyuRx9BmE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GatyuRx9BmE</a></p><p>Either way, these are a few songs by &quot;relatively&quot; (lol) popular bands<br/>that have chords that have half steps in them. Furthermore, there is<br/>nothing special about using a chord with a half step in it. I don&apos;t<br/>see why you have intellectually singled this random interval out as<br/>being &quot;unsuitable&quot; for use in chords. It has something to do with<br/>critical band roughness or whatever, but when the chords aren&apos;t being<br/>held for long periods of time, critical band roughness becomes much<br/>less of an issue. And when they are, it still sounds fine to my ears.</p><p>On a slightly unrelated note, the last song is sort of a marvel of<br/>5-limit harmony in my view and I wish I could figure out what the &quot;big<br/>picture&quot; of what this progression is &quot;saying,&quot; how it fits into<br/>traditional theories of tonality (or how they could be modified to<br/>accommodate it), and if any useful information is to be obtained by<br/>regressing it into a JI interpretation. At the very least it shows<br/>that there&apos;s still some &quot;life&quot; to be squeezed out of 5-limit (or<br/>meantone) harmonies, and that the full gamut of possibilities in<br/>12-tet has hardly been exhausted.</p><p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point, again, is that while I believe use of such chords should not be stuck in use for more academic music, I hope it can manage to work its way into pop without a public reaction of &quot;it&apos;s way too dissonant&quot;.</p><p>Nothing is &quot;too dissonant&quot; for pop music. Check out Floyd&apos;s album<br/>Ummagumma. That album went to #5 on the UK pop charts and basically<br/>consisted of the band members tripping and playing free the whole<br/>time. People can be led anywhere, and when they avoid (or gravitate<br/>towards) certain sounds, it&apos;s often a case more of marketing than of<br/>psychoacoustics.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=87658 href="#87658">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2010 5:21:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike, THANK YOU for this post.

It can be viewed<br/>&gt; as an expansion of VI-&gt;iv-&gt;i, except when the i chord is finally<br/>&gt; reached, the parallel Dorian mode is used as a substitute for the<br/>&gt; usual Aeolian mode. I&apos;ll let you create your own impression of what<br/>&gt; feelings and emotions that evokes, but here&apos;s the song:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GatyuRx9BmE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GatyuRx9BmE</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Either way, these are a few songs by &quot;relatively&quot; (lol) popular bands<br/>&gt; that have chords that have half steps in them. Furthermore, there is<br/>&gt; nothing special about using a chord with a half step in it. I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; see why you have intellectually singled this random interval out as<br/>&gt; being &quot;unsuitable&quot; for use in chords. It has something to do with<br/>&gt; critical band roughness or whatever, but when the chords aren&apos;t being<br/>&gt; held for long periods of time, critical band roughness becomes much<br/>&gt; less of an issue. And when they are, it still sounds fine to my ears.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On a slightly unrelated note, the last song is sort of a marvel of<br/>&gt; 5-limit harmony in my view and I wish I could figure out what the &quot;big<br/>&gt; picture&quot; of what this progression is &quot;saying,&quot; how it fits into<br/>&gt; traditional theories of tonality (or how they could be modified to<br/>&gt; accommodate it), and if any useful information is to be obtained by<br/>&gt; regressing it into a JI interpretation. At the very least it shows<br/>&gt; that there&apos;s still some &quot;life&quot; to be squeezed out of 5-limit (or<br/>&gt; meantone) harmonies, and that the full gamut of possibilities in<br/>&gt; 12-tet has hardly been exhausted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point, again, is that while I believe use of such chords should not be stuck in use for more academic music, I hope it can manage to work its way into pop without a public reaction of &quot;it&apos;s way too dissonant&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nothing is &quot;too dissonant&quot; for pop music. Check out Floyd&apos;s album<br/>&gt; Ummagumma. That album went to #5 on the UK pop charts and basically<br/>&gt; consisted of the band members tripping and playing free the whole<br/>&gt; time. People can be led anywhere, and when they avoid (or gravitate<br/>&gt; towards) certain sounds, it&apos;s often a case more of marketing than of<br/>&gt; psychoacoustics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=87659 href="#87659">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2010 6:12:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>First of all a foreword, my overall point is that, on the average, modern pop-music is too shallow far as what chords it considers to be &quot;usable&quot;.  And the anti-thesis to that, for example, could very well be making more chords available that allow similar levels of consonance yet sound dramatically different.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Every chord that has a major 7 in it by extension contains a semitone<br/>in it when placed in any sort of inversion.&quot;<br/>   The thought hadn&apos;t come to mind when I wrote the original message.  Of course I know 7ths and inversions are common, the 7th inversion = semi-one connection you mentioned just hadn&apos;t come to mind.</p><p>&gt;&quot;What type of 13 chord voicings are getting complaints of being &quot;too<br/>dissonant?&quot; 13 chords have been used in popular music for a long time.&quot;<br/>   I guess it depends what you consider &quot;popular music&quot;.  I&apos;ve looked at tons of current popular electronica and pop midi files (current meaning, within the last 20 years or so) and not seen many 13th chords.  If pop did use advanced chords and voicing so much, why do so many major universities off music theory majors only classical or jazz  as majors?  Just a hunch...I&apos;m guessing it has something to do with more complex chords and voicings.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The only genre of music I can think of in which people voluntarily eschew chords with close intervals would be metal or hard rock or some genre where that interval would sound chaotic when played on an extremely distorted guitar.&quot;<br/>    Well I&apos;ve noticed the pattern in a lot of modern rock and popular electronica.  For example, does Aqua, Britney Spears, Nickelback, Tody Keith, or P Diddy use a lot of sustained 13th chords (or even use them at all)?  I seriously have my doubts.  I&apos;m not saying that kind of music is good...I&apos;m saying I still there should be a push to expand what&apos;s &quot;catchy&quot; to most people to include more advanced tonal structures.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Here&apos;s Zeppelin&apos;s &quot;The Rain Song,&quot; there&apos;s a half step in the second<br/>Here&apos;s The Beatles&apos; &quot;Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds,&quot; there&apos;s a half<br/>Here&apos;s a Joni Mitchell song, &quot;Coyote,&quot;<br/>&quot;<br/>    Right, but the first two are classic rock and the second classic folk, not exactly the modern music I&apos;m hinting at as needing a change.  &quot;Lucy in The Sky with Diamonds&quot; is actually one of my all time favorites...incredibly imaginative just, not modern.   I think Kalle also agreed on this from his last message...pop music has gone backward to more and more primitive chord progressions from the time those songs were made until now.  Ok, so they may use an occasional inverted 7th...but other than the I usually hear a whole lot of plain old major and minor triads.<br/>   Meanwhile what about groups like Way Out West, Steve Vai, or Brian Eno who use lots of weird chords and voicings?  They only have a very limited fan base of often very academically minded people (I&apos;m admittedly a huge fan of all three :-D).</p><p>&gt;&quot;Either way, these are a few songs by &quot;relatively&quot; (lol) popular bands<br/>that have chords that have half steps in them. &quot;<br/>Ha, ok, bad explanation on my part.  I should have been clear and said modern bands IE within the last 15 years.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Nothing is &quot;too dissonant&quot; for pop music. Check out Floyd&apos;s album Ummagumma. That album went to #5 on the UK pop charts and basically<br/>consisted of the band members tripping and playing free the whole time.&quot;<br/>  Again, as I see it that was 1969 in an era where a lot was purposefully trippy and skewed...this is now.  Not that there is anything wrong with the 60&apos;s (Beatles, Byrds, etc. ...a lot of the music was much more imaginative back then IMVHO...but just because someone could get away with it then doesn&apos;t mean it would necessarily work now.  The other thing is a whole bunch of other factors come into play: rhythm, phrasing, lyrics, media attention and marketing.  However (nowadays) if people think a musician is playing out of tune, most often they will lose respect for the group.</p><p>__,_._,__</p></div><h3><a id=87660 href="#87660">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2010 6:32:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bizarre.<br/>Look at the page section<br/><a href="http://www.musiccoach.com/ChordMine/Guitar_chords/">http://www.musiccoach.com/ChordMine/Guitar_chords/</a><br/>......tons of artists use the major 7th<br/><a href="http://www.musiccoach.com/ChordMine/Guitar_chords/Chord/chord_4.aspx">http://www.musiccoach.com/ChordMine/Guitar_chords/Chord/chord_4.aspx</a></p><p>......but look at how relatively few use the 13th<br/><a href="http://www.musiccoach.com/ChordMine/Guitar_chords/Chord/chord_21.aspx">http://www.musiccoach.com/ChordMine/Guitar_chords/Chord/chord_21.aspx</a><br/>....and as for the minor 11th<br/><a href="http://www.musiccoach.com/ChordMine/Guitar_chords/Chord/chord_30.aspx">http://www.musiccoach.com/ChordMine/Guitar_chords/Chord/chord_30.aspx</a><br/>...and the major 9th<br/><a href="http://www.musiccoach.com/ChordMine/Guitar_chords/Chord/chord_16.aspx">http://www.musiccoach.com/ChordMine/Guitar_chords/Chord/chord_16.aspx</a></p><p>    I was wrong about the inverted 7th chords...but I still feel pretty confident in saying more advanced chords are generally reserved for things like jazz, classical, or not-so-current music (like rock groups from the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s).</p></div><h3><a id=87661 href="#87661">ðŸ”—</a>misterbobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2010 7:44:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>I wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Regualr temperaments *are* NOT equal divisions.

Like I keep arguing, it&apos;s just not that common in pop music.

Funny though, because I hear just a plain C# F G# IE a major triad as the third chord...at least for what the rhythm guitar is doing.  I guess you could say the vocal is adding another tone...but (if such is the case) the voice isn&apos;t held very long during that part and therefore sounds (to me) a lot more like a neighboring tone than part of the chord.</p><p>&gt;&quot;P Diddy&apos;s remix of Biggie&apos;s &quot;One More Chance&quot; is in F lydian, another &quot;unconventional&quot; modern pop sound, and I&apos;m sure the half step pops up<br/>at some point in there too: <a href="http://www.youtube">http://www.youtube</a>. com/watch? v=132OAFRqoFI&quot;<br/>   Another good one, even though I&apos;ll argue to an extent that one sounds very close to R&amp;B.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Jason Derulo&apos;s recent top 40 hit has half steps all over it.

It&apos;s standard to use four note chords with a seventh, so much so that a chord without one is even often regarded as incomplete. As I already said to you in a long email some time ago, the logic behind most western music is in the pattern of the *guide tones* between the thirds and sevenths as we cycle. Eg take II IV7 I as Dm7 G7 Cma7. The guide tones (in capitals) are Dm7 = d F a C, G7 = d F g B, and Cma7 = c E g B. If we instead take D7 G7 C7 we see that the guide tones are now descending tritone (b5) intervals: D7 = d F# a C, G7 = d F g B, and C7 = c E g Bb. All of these chords are hardly rare and &apos;esoteric&apos; but make up the vast majority of the jazz standards (of which there are thousands). Just look up the real books. On every page you&apos;ll see a ma7 or a triangle which is the symbol for it. Even when later pop songwriters would write &quot;C&quot; instead of &quot;Cma7&quot;, in 95% of cases the two chords are still interchangeable. Or else they represent C7 (blues) or C6 (country).</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Me&gt; I don&apos;t know about the rest of you, but I don&apos;t avoid using 12TET<br/>&gt; at all.

If nothing else, I think it&apos;s a step in the right direction to convince the public the idea chords denser than, say, a Cadd2 can be useful is definitely a step in the right direction toward micro-tonality.  Even if we both blatantly disagree on how effective the semi-tone is in 12TET (with my opinion being that it&apos;s relatively limited in non-academic use with 12TET and micro-tonality could be a huge key to getting around that limitation).<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=87668 href="#87668">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2010 10:22:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt;&quot; It&apos;s very rare that songwriters in a rock group even know those chords exist,<br/>&gt; and whenever I find a band that does, I tend to like them.&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; True enough and, another way to take it, it&apos;s hard to find a rock group that uses those chords.&nbsp; Like I keep arguing, it&apos;s just not that common in pop music.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I look back at groups like Blue October or The Cure that I liked I keep thinking &quot;aha...so maybe that&apos;s part of why their songs had a certain mystique to them&quot;.</p><p>Sure, but none of this has to do with critical band roughness, which<br/>is my point. If I had to pick a defining characteristic of modern<br/>pop/rock music that I think makes it so bland, I would personally<br/>choose the lack of MODAL chords, and especially of borrowed chords<br/>from different modes. The 60&apos;s, 70&apos;s and 90&apos;s were full of that stuff,<br/>and it&apos;s usually straight major or minor these days.</p><p>Songs that utilize modal progressions tend to come up every now and<br/>then these days, and when they do, I usually like them.</p><p>But my point is that this is now us discussing sociological trends in<br/>popular music. Hardly the type of thing to base a theory of consonance<br/>on, or for the foundations of music. Theories resulting from this sort<br/>of thing generally have huge gaping holes in them and are usually not<br/>bigger than Pythagoras or Harry Partch combined.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Nickelback uses a maj6/9 chord in &quot;Photograph&quot; - the third chord (Dbmaj add6/9). The &quot;6&quot; could also be called a 13 if you want. This<br/>&gt; chord progression also utilizes some modal &quot;tricks&quot; by borrowing chords from the parallel Mixolydian and Dorian modes of I: <a href="http://www.youtube">http://www.youtube</a>. com/watch? v=NhJFkHlNfjQ&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Not going to argue here...that&apos;s a good example: that third chord is a prominent held chord in there not just a &quot;stab&quot;.&nbsp; Funny though, because I hear just a plain C# F G# IE a major triad as the third chord...at least for what the rhythm guitar is doing.&nbsp; I guess you could say the vocal is adding another tone...but (if such is the case) the voice isn&apos;t held very long during that part and therefore sounds (to me) a lot more like a neighboring tone than part of the chord.</p><p>The exact combined voicing that the three guitars are playing is Db Ab<br/>Db F Ab Bb Eb Bb. I can&apos;t tell if some of those octave doublings are<br/>actual fretted notes or just overtones of other notes.</p><p>Also, how did I miss the second chord? Bb F Bb D Eb. Another maj add4<br/>chord, and another very common sound.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;P Diddy&apos;s remix of Biggie&apos;s &quot;One More Chance&quot; is in F lydian, another &quot;unconventional&quot; modern pop sound, and I&apos;m sure the half step pops up<br/>&gt; at some point in there too: <a href="http://www.youtube">http://www.youtube</a>. com/watch? v=132OAFRqoFI&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Another good one, even though I&apos;ll argue to an extent that one sounds very close to R&amp;B.</p><p>It is R&amp;B.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Jason Derulo&apos;s recent top 40 hit has half steps all over it. It uses<br/>&gt; majsus chords that have both a major third and sus4 in it quite a bit.&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, another good one, though (again) I&apos;ll argue to an extent that one sounds very close to R&amp;B.&nbsp; Maybe I should listen to the radio more (in this case)...I actually kind of like this song.</p><p>I don&apos;t get it, how is this an argument? This song went all the way to<br/>#1 on the Hot 100 and stayed there for a while. Is it R&amp;B influenced?<br/>Of course it is. And...?</p><p>You were saying that the only use of &quot;extended&quot; chords is in<br/>&quot;academic&quot; styles of music, such as &quot;jazz.&quot; Well here&apos;s a #1 modern<br/>top 40 single that uses them and you&apos;re saying that it&apos;s invalid<br/>because it&apos;s R&amp;B? Why?</p><p>And for the record, this song samples another extremely popular song<br/>from about a year ago, Imogen Heap&apos;s &quot;Hide and Seek.&quot; There&apos;s chords<br/>with intervals way within the critical band throughout it pretty much<br/>the whole time: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4OLQB7ON9w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4OLQB7ON9w</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Disturbed&apos;s song &quot;Stupify&quot; is in C# phrygian, which has a half step between C# and the root. I&apos;m sure at some point they voice things so<br/>&gt; that that occurs in the form of a half step: <a href="http://www.youtube">http://www.youtube</a>. com/watch? v=CQBNH3UFEC0&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Joe Satriani is known to use odd modes like that as well.&nbsp; I can easily believe this uses half-step voicings.&nbsp; Though I&apos;ll also admit higher dissonance is considered more acceptable in such heavy music (Tool or Nine Inch Nails anyone?)</p><p>Tool and NiN are both awesome. But I no longer get what you&apos;re saying anymore.</p><p>If you&apos;re just commenting that modern pop music generally sucks, I<br/>agree. If you&apos;re saying that use of extended harmonies and modes is<br/>more rare these days than in the 70s and 90s, I also agree (although<br/>there are a few bands that are still creative these days, like<br/>Radiohead and such).</p><p>But if you&apos;re going to elaborate on this and make generalizations<br/>about the &quot;capacity&quot; of the modern listener to appreciate &quot;extended&quot;<br/>chords, and say that it isn&apos;t possible because the latest trend in<br/>popular music is to go simpler with the harmonies, then I disagree.<br/>And I very strongly disagree if you think that it has anything to do<br/>with beating or critical band resolution or psychoacoustics of any<br/>kind, or whether a theory for what&apos;s &quot;good and bad&quot; in music can<br/>result from it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=87669 href="#87669">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2010 10:28:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Mike, except for country and folk music, muso&apos;s haven&apos;t really used major and minor triads since about 1910.

Did you catch those doco&apos;s on the blues by Scorcese and Clint Eastward? I remember an old muso saying that before R n R &quot;jazz&quot; really meant everything besides classical music. But I think that the real problem is marketing, or rather, fake-marketing. I mean its ridiculous to think that Led Zep, Hendrix, the Beatle&apos;s etc... just came out of some cultural vacuum. Lennon/Macartney studied many of the jazz standards which you can hear on their early Decca recordings. Besame&apos; Mucho, Taste of Honey, Till there was you. They then denied it after the fact. Hendrix was Little Richard&apos;s guitarist and began to study jazz and do an album with Miles Davis when he died. Jimmy Page was showing off with Les Paul who put him in his place by copying everything he did on the spot.</p><p>There is also the problem of racial prejudice of the time; unable to put a lid on the evil &quot;jazz&quot; music, the &apos;colonel Tom Parkers&apos; of this world re-packaged it for the puritans under the name &quot;rock n roll&quot;. Add to this the invention of the electric guitar (I believe by Les Paul who was himself a great jazz guitarist) and voila, a new &apos;style&apos; of music was born.</p><p>To improvise on the spot requires an understanding that the whole pop marketing machine, based as it is on record sales, doesn&apos;t acknowledge. (It&apos;s almost impossible to capture real jazz on a record, the fact that Charlie Christian could play for 12 hrs straight or that Jaco could sit in with a band when he didn&apos;t know the song but still play without a mistake). Consequently many brilliant musicians live way below the poverty line, all because the true contribution and history of jazz has been conveniently rewritten and undermined by calling it a &apos;genre&apos;. I for one grew up in my fathers guitar shop and had Jimmy Page, Hendrix, Dave Gilmore...etc under my belt before I started even learning jazz at about 16 yoa. I loved and still love listening to these records. But they rarely hold any harmonic surprises. And I&apos;m by no means unique. Jazz isn&apos;t a style, it is style. I&apos;m coming to think that bad taste is actually a form of theft.

It has something to do with<br/>&gt; critical band roughness or whatever, but when the chords aren&apos;t being<br/>&gt; held for long periods of time, critical band roughness becomes much<br/>&gt; less of an issue. And when they are, it still sounds fine to my ears.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On a slightly unrelated note, the last song is sort of a marvel of<br/>&gt; 5-limit harmony in my view and I wish I could figure out what the &quot;big<br/>&gt; picture&quot; of what this progression is &quot;saying,&quot; how it fits into<br/>&gt; traditional theories of tonality (or how they could be modified to<br/>&gt; accommodate it), and if any useful information is to be obtained by<br/>&gt; regressing it into a JI interpretation. At the very least it shows<br/>&gt; that there&apos;s still some &quot;life&quot; to be squeezed out of 5-limit (or<br/>&gt; meantone) harmonies, and that the full gamut of possibilities in<br/>&gt; 12-tet has hardly been exhausted.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point, again, is that while I believe use of such chords should not be stuck in use for more academic music, I hope it can manage to work its way into pop without a public reaction of &quot;it&apos;s way too dissonant&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nothing is &quot;too dissonant&quot; for pop music. Check out Floyd&apos;s album<br/>&gt; Ummagumma. That album went to #5 on the UK pop charts and basically<br/>&gt; consisted of the band members tripping and playing free the whole<br/>&gt; time. People can be led anywhere, and when they avoid (or gravitate<br/>&gt; towards) certain sounds, it&apos;s often a case more of marketing than of<br/>&gt; psychoacoustics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=87677 href="#87677">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2010 7:39:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;But I think that the real problem is marketing, or rather,<br/>fake-marketing. I mean its ridiculous to think that Led Zep, Hendrix,<br/>the Beatle&apos;s etc... just came out of some cultural vacuum.<br/>Lennon/Macartney studied many of the jazz standards&quot;<br/>  That&apos;s the odd thing...I intended for the discussion to be about modern pop musicians and not older groups like &quot;The Beatles&quot; or &quot;The Who&quot;, who I agree are quite advanced.</p><p>&gt;&quot;unable to put a lid on the evil &quot;jazz&quot; music, the &apos;colonel Tom Parkers&apos;<br/>of this world re-packaged it for the puritans under the name &quot;rock n<br/>roll&quot;. Add to this the invention of the electric guitar (I believe by<br/>Les Paul who was himself a great jazz guitarist) and voila, a new<br/>&apos;style&apos; of music was born. &quot;<br/>    Ah interesting, so you are saying rock was born of Jazz (whereas I&apos;ve been led to believe it was born of blues IE Robert Johnson).  Then again both jazz and blues could easy be considered ultimately African-American music and looking back I do get the odd feeling a certain degree of nasty &quot;white supremacy&quot; was involved in distorting the history of such music.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Consequently many brilliant musicians live way below the poverty line,<br/>all because the true contribution and history of jazz has been<br/>conveniently rewritten and undermined by calling it a &apos;genre&apos;.&quot;<br/>   I can believe it.  I hear musicians playing on the street (jazz or not) who often sound far better than who I hear on the radio and can improvise beautifully for hours on end.  The sad reality though is, genre or not genre, it seems obvious people fall for catchy songs with short/easy motifs, few complex chords, and virtually no modulations beside, say, an occasional transposition for the &quot;bridge&quot; part of a song.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Jazz isn&apos;t a style, it is style. I&apos;m coming to think that bad taste is<br/>actually a form of theft. And why do those who claim that &apos;beauty is in<br/>the eye of the beholder&apos; always have the same records?&quot;<br/>   I actually don&apos;t like the idea of genres and agree it often convinces listeners to stereotype.  When I say I make dance music, people automatically assume 4-on-the-floor-beat, simple chords, cheesy artificial sounding timbres, and a single-themed melody that repeats through the entire song with very little variation.  And when people think of jazz, they often think of a bunch of guys on brass and a lead saxophone or the average guy playing on the street.  IMVHO whenever someone is doing something like using a multi-key modulation in the middle of a verse or using certain extensive chords, they are playing out parts of the &quot;style&quot; jazz.  And if anyone is doing fantastic things with meshing timbres to &quot;morph&quot; into each other and making beats with ghost notes that seem to flow seem-lessly and fit an insane amount of instruments into a song (more often, than even orchestral music) without harmonic clashing typical with using that many acoustic<br/> instruments...they are playing out parts of the &quot;dance&quot; style (BT is a huge example of this for me).</p><p>    The odd pattern is when I see people who say they make jazz music, the common thread is their high ability to deal with complex harmonic structures.  Tina Cousins (a dance musician) actually studied jazz classics and music from before jazz and rock were &quot;singled out&quot; from each other (as you seem to have put it).  Any of her bios hints at just how much jazz training she had.  And her early songs (to me, at least) are truly beautiful with complex dark chords and shimmery vocals that have a lot of the soul and variation of such older music.  And yet the songwriting style is catchy and very well done in a pop sense...it&apos;s not like she lost popularity because her arrangements/phrasing/beats/vocals... weren&apos;t in a catchy style.<br/>    But as time went on she degenerated into writing bubble-gum pop, and not because she didn&apos;t know how to write with the &quot;jazz&quot; attitude.  Her latest records sound fabricated and are no more advertised than her old ones, yet they have sold exponentially more.   Again, it seems there&apos;s a certain addictiveness the public wants that comes with those IMVHO boring pure consonant chords...minus the occasional record where the catchy-ness lies much more in the lyrics or vocal timbre/talent.</p></div><h3><a id=87678 href="#87678">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2010 9:43:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well done Graham- but you do realize that I was making a satirical &quot;analysis&quot; in an attempt to get Gene stop trying to put stupid words in my mouth, don&apos;t you?</p><p>Look through the discussion, you&apos;ll see at least three times &quot;by the logic...&quot; or &quot;it seems that you are saying...&quot; followed by something patently stupid, then followed by me saying, no, that&apos;s NOT the logic, it goes like this...followed by something NOT stupid.</p><p>Well: anyone going to pony up some examples of orwell, schismic and hanson in 53-edo?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; No. In my vocabulary at any rate, a rank one temperament such as 12et or<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 31et is regular.

And the anti-thesis to that, for example, could very well be making more chords available that allow similar levels of consonance yet sound dramatically different.</p><p>Modern pop is not about consonance, it&apos;s about familiarity. Nobody who is into pop music will take to the new chords because they will be unfamiliar, as consonant as they may be. The same shallowness is applied to rhythm, lyrical content and melody too... I&apos;ve heard hook melodies with 2 pitches. Lyrical content is barely important today, but I can say that the pop music in the 80s had some absolute nonsense waste lyrics so no change there.</p><p>If pop music is distasteful to anyone, I have to say that introducing new tunings isn&apos;t gonna save it. When the majority of pop-listeners are after familiarity and simple enjoyment, they will ignore our freaky lil&apos; noodlings. These people tend to listen to music while multitasking anyway, so they will miss the details. These are just general TASTES that we all know are common - because today&apos;s pop is to be found everywhere.</p><p>General tastes WILL change in the future because everything changes. Tastes have changed from the 60s, for better or worse. I am not certain that a future change will occur because of some stylistic shift in popular music. I feel more confident that a change in the general public&apos;s taste will happen because of cultural reasons... A prospective example of a sufficiently significant cultural change: if the music recording industry falls to smush, forcing people to turn to small-time artists, that is more likely to cause changes in listening tastes.</p><p>Until a change happens, we should take a pragmatic approach. Listeners of today&apos;s pop music are happy, and we should let them be happy doing their thing. There are types of people who SHUN such music, and look for exciting new things. Some of these people get so far that they actually stumble across microtonality. We are some of those people. There are others out there who will love microtonality but don&apos;t know it exists yet. Let&apos;s reach out to them by making good microtonal music - yes that qualitative word GOOD - music which might have pop sensibilities, sounds interesting/fun/profound/dance-y/whatever, does NOT insult the listener&apos;s intelligence - and share this fine music with as many people as possible. Forget the masses and stay positive being in a small wonderful community as we are in.</p><p>I want to learn to love the people who like pop music. I don&apos;t understand or appreciate fine food. I know what I like, but I can&apos;t analyse the food or experience it on an intellectual level. I don&apos;t seek out much new food; I don&apos;t challenge my diet. I acknowledge chefs but don&apos;t understand them, and I would be grateful if they didn&apos;t look down on me for eating poor food sometimes.</p><p>At the end of the day this is all talk. I just felt like a natter, and to see what you folks think of my ideas. I should be making music right now, but I got distracted. Let&apos;s get back to just making good music.</p><p>Sean</p><p>PS:<br/>&gt;     Well I&apos;ve noticed the pattern in a lot of modern rock and popular electronica.  For example, does Aqua, Britney Spears, Nickelback, Tody Keith, or P Diddy use a lot of sustained 13th chords (or even use them at all)?</p><p>Yeah but 13ths sound like dirt, mate!! ;)</p></div><h3><a id=87700 href="#87700">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2010 3:47:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi George,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Are you familiar with the scale property known as Rothenberg propriety?

Listeners<br/>of today&apos;s pop music are happy, and we should let them be happy doing<br/>their thing. There are types of people who SHUN such music, and look<br/>for exciting new things. Some of these people get so far that they<br/>actually stumble across micro-tonality.&quot;<br/>  Right but (reality strikes) that has been surprisingly few.  Oddly there seem to be more fans of things like the noise music genre than of micro-tonality.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Until a change happens, we should take a pragmatic approach.&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;yes that qualitative word GOOD - music which might have pop<br/>sensibilities, sounds interesting/ fun/profound/ dance-y/whatever ,<br/>does NOT insult the listener&apos;s intelligence&quot;<br/>  I may be hearing this incorrectly, but I think we may be on the same side of the fence so far as the &quot;does NOT insult the listener&apos;s intelligence&quot; issue.  I also believe we all obviously have different opinions on what&apos;s &quot;good&quot;...but can at least judge certain characteristics as capable of making music at least appear as &quot;decently talented&quot;  or &quot;respectable&quot; to a good percentage of all people.</p><p>   I am not (and never had been) trying to imply we should all kiss the feet of major label tastes and, say, try to make ultra-catchy pop with dead simple themes and the like in an effort to be &quot;more consonant&quot;.   But rather we should at least lean close enough that many people can instinctively tell what we make is not random out-of-key-ness and have a second thought &quot;hey, I could realistically see myself making music with said theories and/or listening to it on a regular basis and not just out of intellectual fascination&quot;..</p><p>  Again I&apos;m not trying to be a downer but I&apos;ve heard talked to a good few professional musicians who make very advanced music (far from bubble gum pop), and even they expressed the attitude that they felt micro-tonal music was too complex to the point of &quot;insulting their intelligence&quot;.<br/>    Again somehow I am getting the impression people mistake what I say as trying to champion simple pop music and ultra-consonance...not at all, I&apos;m trying to find a middle ground that&apos;s close enough to actually get people interested in micro-tonality who wouldn&apos;t be otherwise.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I want to learn to love the people who like pop music.

Many of my tunings are chock-full of chords with beating and I think beating is not a bad thing, though I do believe it can become a problem far as public reception to micro-tonality if the beating, say, exceed 15 or so cents off a fairly low-limit interval.

Some cultures have stuck with 6-tone scales, but it hasn&apos;t become a world-wide phenomenon like 7-tone scales.  Heck, I&apos;d even say Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scales (un-optimized and un-tempered) give a pretty good compromise with &quot;7-tone possibilities with the easy of learning of pentatonic&quot;.  The whole point to me is NOT to stop at things like pentatonic theory and say &quot;ah, that&apos;s the limit, let&apos;s not challenge it further&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You wanted to play shred guitar. And I presume because you thought it<br/>sounded great. The reason you thought it sounded great is because some<br/>kick ass guitarists recording awesome shred guitar.&quot;<br/>     Yes, his skills were great.  But the part that really caught me was the simple harmonic section at the beginning (the song was &quot;The Summer Song&quot; by Joe Satriani).  I learned the harmonics in a few days and it gave me confidence to say &quot;I just might have found a hobby I can get somewhere at&quot; and buy myself a guitar and try to figure out the rest.  If ALL he&apos;d had given me was crazy solos and no imaginative simpler melodic parts, I likely would have just given up early on thinking &quot;oh damn,  this is just too hard and I&apos;m not getting anywhere...this is not for me&quot;.  It was...compromise between pop sensibility that I could instantly understand and mystique and advanced skill that I couldn&apos;t yet understand.  One led me to want to approach the other.

Then again both jazz and blues could easy be considered ultimately African-American music&quot;. Like everything in America it was a melting pot of many ingredients. The blues was considered a part of jazz since both use blue notes. Jazz had its origins in New Orleans marching band music. But the Afro-Americans put in their own style by introducing blue notes and changing the rhythm from a march to a swing. The anticipation of the rhythm left gaps which were then filled by improvised phrases. Later this style was brought to the popular songs which came from Broadway and then Hollywood musicals. These make up the beginnings of the jazz standards. As Cam said below, it was the pop music of its day. And a great deal of its repertoire is blues. It uses minor thirds over major chords, plays flat fifths all over the place and replaces tonic triads with dom sevenths because they sound &apos;sexy&apos;, mischievous and even a form of protest and defiance. It is horn, piano and banjo based because only these instruments were loud enough. Guitar based &apos;blues&apos; OTOH was spread more by recordings and radio. But it was really the invention of the electric guitar that allowed guitarists to solo like the horns. Don&apos;t people realise that Hendrix was doing on guitar what the horns had been doing all along? It was Louie Armstrong who really invented the extended solo, the mov&apos;t from trad to modern. Young white kids then began to imitate the old records and play them on their electric guitars. And what they&apos;re doing now is a distant memory of a dream.</p><p>As for most modern pop I hear nowadays, it just sounds to me like revolution without any stakes. This is particularly hypocritical since their sole motive seems to be money and fame for its own sake. IOW they are just adopting the signs of the revolution like the Che Guavarra T-shirt or the Smirnoff Vodka advertising campaign. Rock bands using Gibson Gold tops and double bass, singer/&apos;songwriters&apos; writing about poverty from the bedroom that their rich daddy provides, &quot;blues&quot; musicians who play the same three chords ad infinitum arriving at the gig in a gold-plated Cadillac. And worse still, the occasional &apos;Beatle&apos;s&apos; chord thrown in like the minor fourth to show how &apos;creative and original&apos; they are. The spoilt grandchildren of the baby boomers, the iGen. The difference between this and the &quot;granny&quot; music, as Cam put it, is that the latter came out of true poverty and repression, two world wars, a depression and racial segregation. In 100 years the honesty and sophistication of this &quot;granny&quot; era will still be remembered while Snoopy Katz and the nazi phlegms will be seen as an embarrassing social illness, the &quot;American dream&quot; gone horribly skewiff.</p><p>Look at me going on.

Add to this the invention of the electric guitar (I believe by<br/>&gt; Les Paul who was himself a great jazz guitarist) and voila, a new<br/>&gt; &apos;style&apos; of music was born. &quot;<br/>&gt;     Ah interesting, so you are saying rock was born of Jazz (whereas I&apos;ve been led to believe it was born of blues IE Robert Johnson).  Then again both jazz and blues could easy be considered ultimately African-American music and looking back I do get the odd feeling a certain degree of nasty &quot;white supremacy&quot; was involved in distorting the history of such music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Consequently many brilliant musicians live way below the poverty line,<br/>&gt; all because the true contribution and history of jazz has been<br/>&gt; conveniently rewritten and undermined by calling it a &apos;genre&apos;.&quot;<br/>&gt;    I can believe it.  I hear musicians playing on the street (jazz or not) who often sound far better than who I hear on the radio and can improvise beautifully for hours on end.  The sad reality though is, genre or not genre, it seems obvious people fall for catchy songs with short/easy motifs, few complex chords, and virtually no modulations beside, say, an occasional transposition for the &quot;bridge&quot; part of a song.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Jazz isn&apos;t a style, it is style. I&apos;m coming to think that bad taste is<br/>&gt; actually a form of theft. And why do those who claim that &apos;beauty is in<br/>&gt; the eye of the beholder&apos; always have the same records?&quot;<br/>&gt;    I actually don&apos;t like the idea of genres and agree it often convinces listeners to stereotype.  When I say I make dance music, people automatically assume 4-on-the-floor-beat, simple chords, cheesy artificial sounding timbres, and a single-themed melody that repeats through the entire song with very little variation.  And when people think of jazz, they often think of a bunch of guys on brass and a lead saxophone or the average guy playing on the street.  IMVHO whenever someone is doing something like using a multi-key modulation in the middle of a verse or using certain extensive chords, they are playing out parts of the &quot;style&quot; jazz.  And if anyone is doing fantastic things with meshing timbres to &quot;morph&quot; into each other and making beats with ghost notes that seem to flow seem-lessly and fit an insane amount of instruments into a song (more often, than even orchestral music) without harmonic clashing typical with using that many acoustic<br/>&gt;  instruments...they are playing out parts of the &quot;dance&quot; style (BT is a huge example of this for me).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     The odd pattern is when I see people who say they make jazz music, the common thread is their high ability to deal with complex harmonic structures.  Tina Cousins (a dance musician) actually studied jazz classics and music from before jazz and rock were &quot;singled out&quot; from each other (as you seem to have put it).  Any of her bios hints at just how much jazz training she had.  And her early songs (to me, at least) are truly beautiful with complex dark chords and shimmery vocals that have a lot of the soul and variation of such older music.  And yet the songwriting style is catchy and very well done in a pop sense...it&apos;s not like she lost popularity because her arrangements/phrasing/beats/vocals... weren&apos;t in a catchy style.<br/>&gt;     But as time went on she degenerated into writing bubble-gum pop, and not because she didn&apos;t know how to write with the &quot;jazz&quot; attitude.  Her latest records sound fabricated and are no more advertised than her old ones, yet they have sold exponentially more.   Again, it seems there&apos;s a certain addictiveness the public wants that comes with those IMVHO boring pure consonant chords...minus the occasional record where the catchy-ness lies much more in the lyrics or vocal timbre/talent.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=87724 href="#87724">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2010 8:56:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;And what in the hell does &quot;physical consonance&quot; mean now? The entire<br/>discussion thus far has been in the vein of there being no singular<br/>dimension of &quot;consonance.&quot;</p><p>Ok, at least to me physical consonance is a combination of<br/>A) Critical band dissonance (yes, as in Sethares-style dissonance)<br/>B) Periodic dissonance (often expressed as JI o-tonality and u-tonality and through terms such as &quot;11 limit&quot;...and completely independent of the concept of critical-band dissonance)<br/>C) Other factors we have yet to fully understand, such as symmetry between notes.</p><p>    For actual consonance, things like personal preference over things like how much beating a person does/doesn&apos;t like comes in.

In that case, perhaps &quot;resolved-ness&quot; is a better word.   In that case, Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s experiment was not about consonance, but about a way other than consonance to achieve resolve.</p><p>&gt;&quot;There&apos;s no need to go to entropy theories to find that it is a simple fact that there is more harmonicity when partials coincide&quot;<br/>    I realize that.

Yes it has tons of inharmonicity.<br/>No it does not have the physical consonance of a low-limit JI ensemble.<br/>No value judgements being made here, just measurable fact.&quot;<br/>    Well drums are obviously in-harmonic (especially things like snares).  But anyone who has programmed compressed audio formats such as MP3 or OGG can tell you all about frequency masking.  If you have a clear harmonic tone louder than tones around it that are very close to it and/or significantly louder than tones that are close but not very close...the brain will only hear the tone and filter out nearby noise.  This is much of how these formats achieve compression...they don&apos;t store the noise that is covered/hidden under the curve caused by the harmonics.  So much of the inharmonicity is not audible...and this largely explains how a song can have so many drums without making the chords clash with them.<br/>   Same goes for the timbres of actual instruments...many of the in-harmonic partials cover each other up in the same way.  So what you see in a spectrogram and what you hear are often quite different.  One obvious example: a highly distorted sounding electric guitar playing a complex chord IE a 13th....certain notes become &quot;hidden&quot; beneath the huge layers of loud overtones.</p><p>   But what if you have instruments at similar volume?  Then you have to worry about harmonicity issues more as two sine waves/harmonic-partials have to be incredibly close (again the usual 7-13 cents point of critical band &quot;dissonance&quot; elimination comes in) to sound like a chorus effect and not like two tones clashing.  Hence we have to be much more careful with tuning foreground instruments than things like drums and background instruments and noises...because so much of the latter ends up being &quot;masked&quot;.  Just because it&apos;s not, say, &quot;pure&quot; acoustic classical music, which has much tamer overtones and often few to no drums) doesn&apos;t mean it skews how important things like aligning prominent harmonics on the main/non-background instruments are.   I don&apos;t know why I find myself feeling the need to say this on such a list but...tuning to enforce a fair degree of harmonicity and indirectly resolved-ness really does make a huge difference to most listeners<br/> and musicians alike.</p><p>__,_._,__</p></div><h3><a id=87733 href="#87733">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/20/2010 11:54:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alright, since we&apos;re going in circles, I&apos;ll try to be as clear as<br/>possible: there is more to &quot;consonance&quot; than the coinciding of<br/>partials. As has been discussed here before, if there really were a<br/>type of consonance that sort of syncs up with the usual layman&apos;s<br/>definition of the term, it would probably be the entropy-based<br/>consonance, over Sethares&apos;s &quot;partials coinciding&quot; consonance. I&apos;ve<br/>been personally calling the entropy-based consonance &quot;harmonicity,&quot;<br/>because I think it&apos;s a pretty accurate description of what is really<br/>going on. And in comparison, Sethares&apos; notion of consonance I<br/>attribute the more familiar term &quot;accordance.&quot; I&apos;m not married to<br/>those words but I will use them as such in this message just to keep<br/>confusion to a minimum.</p><p>Now, as to what you are saying - by your definition of &quot;consonance&quot;<br/>(what I would call &quot;concordance&quot;), a triad played with sine waves is<br/>not consonant at all, since it is by definition not &quot;concordant,&quot; as<br/>there are no partials to coincide with. Another problem is, as I<br/>mentioned, that the whole concept breaks down even further when you&apos;re<br/>dealing with detuned leads or leads with chorus or heavy vibrato on<br/>them, as this will &quot;smear&quot; the partials (via convolution if you know<br/>all about that).</p><p>A third problem is that for a great number of timbres the rolloff is<br/>steep enough that by the time the 5th harmonic comes around it&apos;s<br/>sitting low enough in volume to be almost completely &quot;masked&quot; by the<br/>octave harmonic of the 12-tet major 3rd. If one tone is significantly<br/>louder than the other, there isn&apos;t going to be a lot of beating. This<br/>would be true of rhodes patches and such.</p><p>A fourth problem is that the beating if it does exist between the two<br/>partials might even be low enough to not be heard at all, or be masked<br/>by other things happening around the same frequency range that cover<br/>it up. In tandem with this, a fifth problem is that the beating might<br/>not last long enough to be heard anyway.</p><p>But assuming that we&apos;re dealing with a instrument tuned perfectly to<br/>12-tet, with no vibrato, no partial inharmonicity (or the tuning<br/>stretched to match it), with a timbre where the beating is audible,<br/>and with the chord being sustained long enough - then yes, you&apos;re<br/>right. It will be perceived as not completely concordant, but rather<br/>with some &quot;beating&quot; (which is just another term for partial-dependent<br/>vibrato). Of course, since vibrato and chorus aren&apos;t really that out<br/>of place in modern pop music, most people won&apos;t even notice this, and<br/>in fact they don&apos;t.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=87738 href="#87738">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2010 12:03:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The most advanced!</p><p>BTW Gene, and sorry for the abuse of the list for this, but have you been<br/>getting my offlist PMs?

Very often the music uses only one scale, or one tuning, and improvised variations of course have some patterns but we westerners need to get use to it and listen carefully to hear such things like motifs and their development, this music uses different principles than western music. Also orchestration is simple, something like western big orchestras playing multi-layered or polyphonic music with different instrument groups is rare in non-western music (Japan, China, to name some...). So there&apos;s usually nothing like western counterpoint or harmony, and using this for making the emotions. World music emphasizes expressivity, detailed work with different modulations of pitch, timbre, articulation, also metrorhythmics is based on different principles, much more complex than western music.

The intersection is an effect and not a cause...many of Sethares&apos; timbres do not intersect when played with their suggested scales but rather &quot;either intersect or avoid each other fairly well on the average&quot;, thus avoiding the peak areas of the critical band dissonance curve.  The only exception where this works where all harmonics intersect perfectly is with TET scales where the timbre IS the scale.</p><p>      Periodicity/&quot;harmonic entropy&quot;, meanwhile, far as I know tries to use low-limit fractions in order to ensure the harmonics intersect directly and not.  This also has the side effect of enforcing periodicity, which Sethares&apos; algorithm does not.<br/>----Periodicity can exist regardless of whether we use sine waves or full-on timbres with overtones: two 3/2 apart sine waves will always repeat in a shorter period than two sine waves 6/5 apart...that&apos;s just basic physics.  So if not more &quot;consonant&quot;, in your words, a more periodic interval (even with just sine waves) does sound more resolved...and again, I think of consonance/concordance/etc. ...as simply being pathways to the emotional aspect that is &quot;resolvedness&quot;.-----</p><p>&gt;&quot;A third problem is that for a great number of timbres the rolloff is steep enough that by the time the 5th harmonic comes around it&apos;s sitting low enough in volume to be almost completely &quot;masked&quot; by the octave harmonic of the 12-tet major 3rd.&quot;<br/>  Right...which is why I think may of these algorithms, including Sethares&apos; derivation of JI diatonic assuming fairly influential amplitude peaks over the 5th harmonic, are flawed.  I&apos;ve actually brought this up a few times before.  I&apos;m not convinced JI diatonic, in many ways, is an ideal solution for the problem, even with full-on harmonic timbres.  Nice to see also...that you are mentioning/taking-into-account masking this time around...I don&apos;t hear that a lot beside from people who do audio compression and/or are audiologists.</p><p>&gt;&quot;with a timbre where the beating is audible, and with the chord being sustained long enough - then yes, you&apos;re right. &quot;<br/>     Oh man, for about the 10th time this is not what I&apos;m saying.  I&apos;m not trying to imply we should all go for &quot;beat-less consonance&quot;...but rather reach a compromise where we have, say, most audible partials (about the 5th and under) collide within 13 cents or so of intersection of other partials and root tones and with a decent degree of periodicity (&quot;x/12&quot; or so is close enough in my book).</p><p>      12TET DOES satisfy this and makes a fine system for harmony when &quot;used by the experts&quot; but<br/>A) It requires musicians to take many years of intense theory to find all the sweet spots so far as chords...in part because things like putting many whole steps in a row in a chord or putting more than one semi-tone within a chord are virtually illegal (do them, and many people will assume you just don&apos;t know chord theory).  The fact that many people &quot;need a Doctorate to jam&quot; (and supposedly really know all the ins and outs of using just 12 tones) is a fleeting example of this.  12 years to learn 12 notes really isn&apos;t that uncommon...so much for a &quot;simple/easy and elegant system&quot;...in some ways.  IMVHO we need so much theory to get around 12TET in a large part because there are so many &quot;holes&quot; in it.</p><p>     We also have side-effects like different modes that have the exact same notes as whole other keys and relative major/minor scales that contain the same notes in order (as I&apos;ve seen) to stress certain roots as &quot;tonic&quot; or &quot;dominant&quot; and decide which chords should be able to &quot;deserve&quot; the label &quot;consonant&quot; in that mode.  We have guideline terms like &quot;X type of chord always resolves to Y type of chord&quot; rather than having the option of using either as a point of resolve.<br/>    And this may sound normal to us, but it often sounds really off-putting to a starting musician or even a somewhat intermediate one.</p><p>   Thus we are stuck with a global system with a learning curve that scares off a whole lot of people, no matter how beautiful or &quot;worth it&quot; others may say the result is.  And, IMVHO, the more time and effort composers have to use working through theory while writing a song, the less time they have to focus on the emotional aspects of the song and &quot;make it sound like they are having fun and not just an academic exercise&quot; when the listener hears it.</p><p>B)   Has exhausted a lot of its own potential.  So many of the possible combinations of 12TET chords have already been used and new artists often have to resort to changes in things like different phrasing, different arrangements, different effects, and slight changes in melody to breath any life into it.   A scale which allowed some extra completely new sounding chords and intervals and allowed musicians to &quot;start fresh&quot; without ending up virtually copying other people&apos;s work, would be much appreciated for the sake of musical growth IMVHO.</p><p>     I don&apos;t have anything against 12TET because it&apos;s &quot;not pure enough&quot;, &quot;beats to much&quot;, or &quot;has too much critical band dissonance&quot;...indeed I think, to most people, it is close enough to pure to work.  I am just frustrated with its monopoly mainly for reasons A and B.</p></div><h3><a id=87775 href="#87775">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2010 7:52:36 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Excuse me!

As has been discussed here before, if there really were a<br/>&gt; type of consonance that sort of syncs up with the usual layman&apos;s<br/>&gt; definition of the term, it would probably be the entropy-based<br/>&gt; consonance, over Sethares&apos;s &quot;partials coinciding&quot; consonance. I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; been personally calling the entropy-based consonance &quot;harmonicity,&quot;<br/>&gt; because I think it&apos;s a pretty accurate description of what is really<br/>&gt; going on. And in comparison, Sethares&apos; notion of consonance I<br/>&gt; attribute the more familiar term &quot;accordance.&quot; I&apos;m not married to<br/>&gt; those words but I will use them as such in this message just to keep<br/>&gt; confusion to a minimum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, as to what you are saying - by your definition of &quot;consonance&quot;<br/>&gt; (what I would call &quot;concordance&quot;), a triad played with sine waves is<br/>&gt; not consonant at all, since it is by definition not &quot;concordant,&quot; as<br/>&gt; there are no partials to coincide with. Another problem is, as I<br/>&gt; mentioned, that the whole concept breaks down even further when you&apos;re<br/>&gt; dealing with detuned leads or leads with chorus or heavy vibrato on<br/>&gt; them, as this will &quot;smear&quot; the partials (via convolution if you know<br/>&gt; all about that).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A third problem is that for a great number of timbres the rolloff is<br/>&gt; steep enough that by the time the 5th harmonic comes around it&apos;s<br/>&gt; sitting low enough in volume to be almost completely &quot;masked&quot; by the<br/>&gt; octave harmonic of the 12-tet major 3rd. If one tone is significantly<br/>&gt; louder than the other, there isn&apos;t going to be a lot of beating. This<br/>&gt; would be true of rhodes patches and such.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A fourth problem is that the beating if it does exist between the two<br/>&gt; partials might even be low enough to not be heard at all, or be masked<br/>&gt; by other things happening around the same frequency range that cover<br/>&gt; it up. In tandem with this, a fifth problem is that the beating might<br/>&gt; not last long enough to be heard anyway.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But assuming that we&apos;re dealing with a instrument tuned perfectly to<br/>&gt; 12-tet, with no vibrato, no partial inharmonicity (or the tuning<br/>&gt; stretched to match it), with a timbre where the beating is audible,<br/>&gt; and with the chord being sustained long enough - then yes, you&apos;re<br/>&gt; right. It will be perceived as not completely concordant, but rather<br/>&gt; with some &quot;beating&quot; (which is just another term for partial-dependent<br/>&gt; vibrato). Of course, since vibrato and chorus aren&apos;t really that out<br/>&gt; of place in modern pop music, most people won&apos;t even notice this, and<br/>&gt; in fact they don&apos;t.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=87777 href="#87777">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2010 8:00:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>yeah if pentatonic was popular you&apos;d think a genre like Blues would use<br/>it...</p><p><a href="http://www.cyberfret.com/scales/blues/index.php">http://www.cyberfret.com/scales/blues/index.php</a></p><p>On Wed, Apr 21, 2010 at 10:52 AM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Excuse me!

Here in Japan I have very often feeling the second case is true. Amateur musicians (and here is music hobbyist sector very strong, which is bad for us professionals} don&apos;t take care too much about tuning issues, they don&apos;t mind to be out of tune. Fortunately it doesn&apos;t disturb the music itself, its structure allows it as there&apos;s no harmony element, chord accompaniment. And distuning of ceremonial Buddhist or Shinto music for sure IS intentional, but until now I couldn&apos;t find any order in it. It looks like they play that detuned heterophony randomly, and the reason can be purely acoustic - to get more loud music, shrill. Exact tuning is not important, important is to have unison or octaves almost half tone out of tune. If they would use the same instruments, it would be difficult to listen, but fortunately distuned different instruments and human voice (like high flute shinobue, reed instrument hichiriki and singing) are not so bad together. One easily get used to it and even enjoy it, it&apos;s exciting experience.

I&apos;d say it&apos;s too simple for my ears...but I applaud the way it mediates between micro-tonal complexity and pop sensibility to &quot;meet half way&quot; so the average Joe can manage to crack a smile about the art of micro-tonality.  Also to note about 17TET...it really isn&apos;t that weird a scale: the third tone intersects the just major 2nd and the 7th or so tone virtually hits the just major third...so at least for things like basic triadic harmony it seems it should sound normal to the public ear...it&apos;s certainly not, say, 10TET (even though I enjoy 10TET for my own socially disconnected reasons ;-) ).</p><p>    The perfectionist in me says...&quot;so ok...some people may have the urge try occasional simple micro-tonal piano solos now...but what about full fairly high-polyphony songs&quot;.

Rock / electronic music isn&apos;t<br/>usually very polyphonic.. .&quot;<br/>   Not hugely polyphonic, but often much more so than that piano solo, for example.  Again I think Marcus Satellite, for example, has reached a level of polyphony large enough to convince the average musician or listener that non-12TET-based easy to listen to micro-tonal harmony is within reach.  Marcus sticks with 6 notes and not the full 7 of flexibility musicians come to expect but, hey; it&apos;s a start.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You may remember I was challenged to write something that didn&apos;t sound like Debussy et al. in a whole tone scale because &quot;Debussy and Satie&quot; had done it all.&quot;<br/>No, but I&apos;m listening. :-)</p><p>&gt;&quot; And then I was asked to try 18 ET.  Both are here <a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=3">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=3</a>&quot;<br/>    It&apos;s indeed quite different, but some consonance issues mean I wouldn&apos;t want to pitch it to a first-time micro-tonal listener (even though I consider it good myself for selfish-personal listening).</p><p>&gt;&quot;It was actually very easy to do. All one needs to do is take a fresh approach sometimes. And that is a choice by the composer.&quot;<br/>     Well damn...here we go yet again with a &quot;let&apos;s change the composer style to optimize and not the tuning&quot; approach.  Of course enough deviance (and admittedly a fair deal of cleverness) on the part of a composer can twist even a &quot;predictable&quot; interval system in all sorts of weird ways.  My take on, say, the above example is you did manage to make it sound original, but lost listen-ability among less avant-garde listeners (IE very well could be the majority of listeners).  Again my perspective is...the limitations of the scale had a great part in preventing you from making something sound original without losing a lot of listen-ability.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Look - you keep saying &quot;its impossible, its too complex&quot; and all I see are members of this list doing the complex impossible thing time after time.&quot;<br/>      I don&apos;t think it&apos;s &quot;impossible&quot; as in can&apos;t be done...I just think it&apos;s a very very long shot in getting the average listener to understand and champion things like your example above, regardless of how original it is and, say, how different it manages to be from Debussy or Satie.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I agree that your tunings are great - several people have said so and<br/>I have the statistics of pieces written in your tunings to prove it.<br/>So you have a talent and ear for devising accessible tunings.&quot;</p><p>   Well thank you!  &quot;even&quot; I don&apos;t think I&apos;m there yet with regards to a tuning that will satisfy the double-standard of highly original and very easy for the general public to understand...but I&apos;m glad I seem to be getting there.  The rubber will really hit the road if, say, I can get my professional jazz guitarist brother to buy a fret-less guitar and start playing using my scales live.  I think it&apos;s a good ultimate test...to stick a micro-tonal tuned song in the middle of a set of 12TET live music and see how the crowd responds.</p><p>&gt;&quot;On the other hand I think your view of composition is strangely narrow<br/>minded.&quot;<br/>   Meaning, the view that certain tunings open up new worlds of composition to average musicians and listeners alike that can&apos;t be at all readily created (without large losses of listenability) by all but the most clever composers using not-so-consonance-calculated ones?<br/>   I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a limit to composition.  What I do think there is...is a limit for the average musician and listener to digest complexity (not everyone can be or digest a Debussy whole, lol)...and I&apos;m trying to sneak some serious fiber supplement into the &quot;micro-tonal&quot; diet and swap the &quot;12TET diet&quot; for it at times when no one is looking. ;-)</p></div><h3><a id=87788 href="#87788">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2010 10:05:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes, that could be the case.

It looks like they play<br/>&gt; that detuned heterophony randomly, and the reason can be purely<br/>&gt; acoustic - to get more loud music, shrill. Exact tuning is not<br/>&gt; important, important is to have unison or octaves almost half tone<br/>&gt; out of tune. If they would use the same instruments, it would be<br/>&gt; difficult to listen, but fortunately distuned different instruments<br/>&gt; and human voice (like high flute shinobue, reed instrument hichiriki<br/>&gt; and singing) are not so bad together. One easily get used to it and<br/>&gt; even enjoy it, it&apos;s exciting experience.

Of course...you can do things like go the extremes and use all 10 fingers at once on a piano or all strings at once on a violin.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Counterpoint for solo violin? That is exactly what Bach achieved. It<br/>is primarily implied counterpoint, or &quot;compound melody&quot;. The most<br/>obvious example is in var 8&quot;&quot;<br/>   Agreed, I&apos;m not arguing with you on this.  I agree solos can be polyphonic.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And I am not asking any composer to change their style - that is what<br/>you are doing!!  You are saying the average composer is incapable of understanding<br/>microtonal music so you want to help.&quot;<br/>   I wouldn&apos;t say they are ultimately incapable, I am saying they are not capable at the beginning of their &quot;micro-tonal careers&quot;.<br/>A good learning progression in, say, math, may start with algebra and lean into calculus later...but teaching someone who&apos;s never even had the time to learn algebra calculus could very well scare them off...even if they have the ultimate potential to learn calculus.  Another example...the average musician may well eventually be able to digest your &quot;hyper-modal&quot; tuning=scale style of composition or ultimately even make similar things themselves...but very likely won&apos;t get there if you hit them with it full-force on the first shot.  Throughout music history change in style happened incrementally...there was no sudden &quot;sweep&quot; when everyone gained the ability to use a new style as an alternative.</p><p>   I don&apos;t see how I&apos;m &quot;forcing a style&quot;...I see it as giving an alternative or &quot;allowing people to get the chance to digest the algebra before they tackle the calculus if they want to do it that way&quot;.  I surely never want, say, one of my scales to become a somewhat monopolistic standard everyone has to learn as &quot;the only alternative&quot; (the sort of thing 12TET has become).</p><p>&gt;&quot;The vast majority of musicians and composers actually learn mostly if not completely by ear. This by passes all of the &quot;academic&quot; stuff you complain about having to<br/>learn.&quot;<br/>      Good point, many musicians do.  But the same musicians, I&apos;m betting, often run into trouble when trying to by-ear process complex chords and such.  Lord knows I&apos;ve played with enough of them.  They may hit 95% of the notes correctly and 5% of the notes sour (even from the point of the more basic physics in psycho-acoustics) and keep on re-adjusting and &quot;skewing&quot; the chord again and again trying to get that last tone or so to fit.  I&apos;ve been there and done that.  The other option seems to be limit your style to more simple chords and the &quot;reason&quot; why complex chords aren&apos;t used as often being that many musicians &quot;don&apos;t know they exist&quot;...I&apos;m guessing many of them simply can work out simpler chords and moods by ear and not more complex ones.   Case in point...a whole bunch of the modern &quot;by ear&quot; rock bands who have never been to music school.<br/>  So even with playing by-ear, I believe, the 12TET learning curve can leave many inspiring musicians impatient about the learning process.  And if you&apos;re not careful with what micro-tonal theory you introduce them to as a first step, I&apos;m betting they will see it as even more patience testing and even end up walking away to play Guitar Hero (doh!).</p><p>&gt;&quot;And once again....

The other thing is...those blue notes are mostly used in melody, not in the actual backing chords...so it doesn&apos;t exactly cover the polyphonic struggles of micro-tonal music popularity IMVHO.</p></div><h3><a id=87792 href="#87792">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2010 11:07:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike,</p><p>I&apos;m finding this conversation being very narrow minded.</p><p>You are convinced your view of how composers view microtonal music is the<br/>only possible view.

It hasn&apos;t worked for the last 30+ years, so why now would it all of sudden take off without new options?  Point is if it&apos;s not &quot;selling&quot;...sure the marketing could be sour, but there&apos;s an overwhelming chance people just can&apos;t find a good basic &quot;starting&quot; use for our &quot;product&quot; and we need some degree of re-structuring to break through.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;I honestly disagree with your reasoning for your method of bringing<br/>&gt; micro music to the masses. On the other hand I like your tunings. &quot;<br/>&gt;       Ha well....you hate the method but you like some of what comes out of the logic of it (IE the tunings).  I admittedly get that a lot, the cause stinks and is &quot;narrow minded&quot; but the effect/symptom is somehow cool and in some cases &quot;opens new possibilities&quot;. :-D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;With the technology available today it is easier than ever to experiment with microtonal music. You can do it for free if you already own a<br/>&gt; computer. In my view all they need is a reason to explore. And the only<br/>&gt; one I can find is for them to hear ass kicking microtonal  music. Even<br/>&gt; with one of your super consonant tunings there will not be a reason<br/>&gt; until someone writes some compelling music. &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Agreed.  I have a funny feeling Sevish may be the first to really break down that barrier.  His last example he sent me with even the &quot;flawed&quot; 12-tone version of my scale sounded fantastic.  And I just handed him a version of my scale rounded to 22TET (it actually rounds pretty well, BTW).<br/>&gt;     I agree with you the technology is there and all people need is a good reason to compose.  One route: great micro-tonal music (the type that&apos;s easily identifiable as different than 12TET) + quick to learn theory = lots of people at least giving micro-tonal an initial shot.  My as you called them &quot;ultra-consonant&quot; scales are simply one option of making scales with dead easy to learn theory that still have enough flexibility to make fairly expansive and impressively varied music with (thus trying to hit both points dead-on).  Again, if you know of any other routes...please speak now....I&apos;m not saying there aren&apos;t any but I don&apos;t know of many convincing ones (Wilson&apos;s 6-tone MOS scales and Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon scales are two of my other favorite options for that purpose...22TET decatonic isn&apos;t bad either but the learning curve (minus maybe the Blackwood scale) may intimidate some).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=87799 href="#87799">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2010 1:41:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;Yes, I do - but like the 17 ET piano improvisation The Pond you reject<br/>them out of hand because they don&apos;t meet some criterion or criteria of<br/>yours.&quot;<br/>   Ugh, so harsh.</p><p>    Maybe I didn&apos;t state myself clearly enough...but when I responded about that track I basically said it was &quot;on the right track&quot;.

Same goes for Erv Wilson&apos;s &quot;Six Hexanies&quot; scale (namely in the hands of Marcus Satellite&apos;s music), deca-tonic scales, and other things I keep bringing back up.  And to be fair, for example...I think decatonic scales have more harmonic flexibility and polyphonic chords possible than my scale but a steeper learning curve.  &quot;Six Hexanies&quot; has a startlingly bright happy interval sound (at least judging by Marcus Satellite&apos;s works) and I&apos;m guessing is (even) easier to use than my scale, but probably has less possible chords and melodies due to being limited to 6 tones.

Different people may favor different scales and I certainly don&apos;t think one scale will (or should!) have a monopoly for &quot;following the right path&quot;, but, on average, I&apos;m pushing for at least some music in scales that fit in a general area I&apos;m pretty sure will be taken seriously by the general public.</p></div><h3><a id=87800 href="#87800">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/21/2010 2:25:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene&gt;&quot;There&apos;s a great liberation to be had in just saying screw what people<br/>think.&quot;<br/>     Which I see and use often.

A piece of music does not have to be complex to be good.&quot;<br/>      Meanwhile you appear to be talking in extremes, which is not what I&apos;m saying and never what I said.  I never said music has to be complex, I said it usually has to achieve a certain minimum level of complexity to gain interest.   For example (even) in today&apos;s simplest hip hop you usually have, say, more than a few drums and at least 3 note chords.  When you&apos;re talking even basic rock, you&apos;re talking 4 note chords (including the bass-line).  Ask just about any listener if something without that sort of minimum level of complexity sounds like a complete song and something they&apos;d buy or want to hear live at a major venue (not a $5 club or bar) and I&apos;m betting most would say no.<br/>  If there were no minimum level of complexity someone singing a monophonic vocal alone or just doing a sax solo with one drum behind it could make it as popular music.  Could it happen?  Of course.  Is it anywhere near realistic for the average musician (or poet?) to accomplish.  I highly doubt it.</p><p>&gt;&quot;This is why someone with an acoustic guitar, and an on pitch (not even great!) voice and a sincere message can get across to people.&quot;<br/>   I don&apos;t get the point.  I&apos;m trying to figure out certain optimizations far as &gt;tuning&lt; (and the aspect of polyphony related to it) and meanwhile you seem more interested in getting your message across that people can relate to things that have nothing to do with optimized tuning or polyphony.  Fine, so some people can, say, relate to, for example, the William Hung&apos;s of the world or those like Bob Dylan who many say wasn&apos;t good at all with the exception of his lyrics.  Would people say, hate him more if he put some more surprising polyphony over his already classic lyrics?  I&apos;m betting on yes...I don&apos;t see any way that &quot;adding more dimensions of talent&quot; could hurt his cause.  Easy example of a group that did both classic lyrics and added IMVHO clever use of polyphony and got even much better known because of that: The Beatles.</p><p>     Ok, so maybe some guys like him could make audio-tape poems with a single drum in the background and monophonic lyrics and charts of some sort.  How does knowing that somehow help us micro-tonalists make better music...by saying &quot;our music is good because of compositional skill and not much at all because it&apos;s micro-tonal&quot;?    I&apos;m confused...you almost seem to be saying the art of micro-tonality perhaps shouldn&apos;t matter beyond, say, simply being different than 12TET and almost seeming to approach the idea of &quot;why even bother with trying to improve chords or find new ones in micro-tonality...it&apos;s a pointless cause&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;and that does not mean 9 note chords or liquid beats or this or that are required.&quot;<br/>     Pardon my &quot;French&quot;, but now it seems you&apos;re just being a bastard for its own sake.  Just because I don&apos;t think something like 2 note chords are likely to become pop means I&apos;d ever insist on 9 note chords.  If you&apos;re going on that route, you might as well blame Sethares for &quot;indirectly insisting musician MUST write music in scales that sound terrible with harmonic-series timbres&quot; just because he wrote the song &quot;Ten Fingers&quot; in 10TET.<br/>     I can relate to him.   I&apos;m not demanding people with music with 9-note chords...rather, I&apos;m shooting evidence in the face of the stereotype that micro-tonal must lean toward either small chords or dissonance...in the same way Sethares was shooting evidence in the face that you can&apos;t make 10TET music consonant using instruments with overtones.  I think it&apos;s obvious he wasn&apos;t saying &quot;down with music in non-weird keys&quot;, he was saying &quot;now you have these weird keys as a realistic/added option if you want to use it in a way that sounds fairly understandable by most people.  Heck, if you look at Erv Wilson&apos;s descriptions of why A) he makes his MOS scales near TET spaced, but B) not so near they veer from harmonic relationships...you can see in A) he&apos;s referencing critical band dissonance and in B) he&apos;s referencing periodicity/harmonic-entropy...both related to the &quot;added option&quot; of creating consonant micro-tonal chords.  And both of those &quot;guys&quot; talk<br/> about making accessible tunings and make deliberate efforts to reduce the micro-tonal learning curve for polyphonic music.</p><p>    Those/these guys wouldn&apos;t be considered leaders in the field if they were not onto something.

That&apos;s the whole reason detuned leads are so common these days.&quot;<br/>     Hmm...detuned lead = chorus effect (to the human ear), barely any added dissonance.  Looking at Plomp and Llevelt&apos;s critical band curve gives us that: notes that are extremely close actually have very low dissonance and very little beating/&quot;roughness&quot;.  Or play two sine waves tuned just a few cents apart.  I just figure...this maybe not the best example of &apos;why the public likes some beating&quot;.  I will agree that some people dislike the sound of periodicity buzz caused by several successive intervals perfectly along the harmonic series in a row IE 6:7:8:9:10 (6 = 600hz) with sine wave.  Heck, I dislike periodicity buzz, sounds like a robot gnawing on something to a constant banging beat which modulates at 100hz...to me at least, there definitely is such a thing as &quot;too perfect&quot; or &quot;too just&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Beating is just partial-dependent vibrato. It&apos;s nothing to be scared of. &quot;<br/>  True, that&apos;s all it is.  But it can make a sound choppy and, at least as I&apos;ve heard, make it harder to decipher all the &quot;virtual roots&quot; in a chord.  There actually does seem to come a point where more dissonance via beating leads to a lower sense of tonal color IE what &quot;tonal color&quot; does your snare drum hiss or semi-tone cluster have?</p><p>&gt;&quot;Maybe if you&apos;re addicted to the sound of all of the partials colliding, then you won&apos;t like it. Most people could care less.&quot;<br/>     Hmm...well then why do people say things like chords in 24TET that don&apos;t stick in a 12TET subset sound unbearable?   I&apos;m betting a good chunk of that reasoning had something to do with beating....</p></div><h3><a id=87829 href="#87829">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2010 12:09:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Plus I guarantee you that people today love beating.

For beating issues to really start to &quot;bite&quot;, 20+ cents off (to cause beating between partials) is probably more like it...even many non-trained musicians would hear the 20 cents difference.  But, overall, beating does (of course) have a fair &quot;slack&quot; period we can and do take advantage of for things like tempering.</p></div><h3><a id=87838 href="#87838">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2010 7:59:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;I was just thinking how strong an effect physical consonance really is.<br/>I&apos;m recording a tune in 13-limit JI, which is usual for me, and it&apos;s<br/>really more JI on a technicality, lots of very complex intervals.

The problem area seems to come where you have, say, chords approaching 17-limit and the first/last notes of the chord spaced at a decisively non-periodic interval.  There&apos;s a lot of slack in my book before the sort of &quot;extreme beating&quot; that makes it hard to tell sound from noise overrides actual clear sound.  I&apos;d also take a 13-limit scale that&apos;s well spaced over a 7 or even 5-limit one that uses &quot;extreme&quot;-harmonic intervals like 1.52 (35/23) where the partials beat so violently deciphering all of the sound becomes an issue or 24/23 where the beating of the root tones seems so violent you can&apos;t hear the tones as individual elements and the &quot;value of 2 sounds of variety seems more like the value of 1&quot;.</p><p>  If I hear a scale that sounds incredibly new and fresh, I&apos;ve found chances are it&apos;s around 9 to 11 limit and sometimes 7-limit.  And I&apos;ve seen lots of 11-limit scales, including the last Marvel tuning Gene posted here, which actually sound virtually as &quot;smooth&quot; to me as 5-limit much due to clever use of near-super-particular intervals and good root-tone spacing.  I&apos;ve also tried making JI scales from harmonics 7-14 and such and couldn&apos;t stand the lack of tonal color or periodic buzz due to the so called &quot;lack of beating&quot; in those scales.

It&apos;s the old<br/>people reliving their youth.  So what&apos;s written down is the government<br/>approved style of that time, based on traditional Chinese music but<br/>with some western harmony.  The tunings, though, are what makes sense<br/>to those musicians.  They seem to vary regionally, even from one group<br/>to another in the same park.  But I swear they know what they&apos;re<br/>doing.  I&apos;ve heard out of tune music from students, and it&apos;s not the<br/>same.  The people in the parks will tune while the rest of the band&apos;s<br/>playing, even though the result is that they&apos;re all out of tune with<br/>each other.

All the children who learn traditional instruments<br/>(which is fashionable now) learn it.  Sometimes they put up a sheet in<br/>the park and people sing from it.  If you learn an exotic instrument<br/>like piano or guitar, you&apos;ll use an exotic notation for it, but<br/>traditional instruments are always jianpu.  It&apos;s naturally diatonic.<br/>I&apos;ve never seen a traditional piece written with accidentals, although<br/>it is possible.  The actual music, then, is more or less pentatonic.<br/>Some songs completely so.  And songs from the Chinese heartlands may<br/>have diatonic inflections, but songs from Korea or Tibet may not.  Of<br/>course, there&apos;s a filter behind all the books these things get<br/>published in.</p><p>The microtonal inflections are never written down and I never<br/>encountered any theory about it.

But this new side you are taking seems to contradict a whole lot of what you&apos;ve done in the past and seems to make the only alternative to proving polyphony to be &quot;make music with very little polyphony&quot;, which comes across as one step away from saying &quot;your cause is pointless...look at all the great songs I wrote that prove you are wrong...despite all the times you&apos;ve taken my advice, and my alternative to you is turn around and start over&quot;.</p><p>    Now can you see, why I&apos;m frustrated?

That and the challenge of making chord progressions under 12TET that aren&apos;t almost exactly the same as many already made.</p><p>    But can 12TET be improved far as learning curve?  Of course.  For example We have 9th, 11th and 13th chords but not 8th, 10th, and 12th chords.  There is no CDEF chord in most standard music books.  There are chords you can try to &quot;harmonize&quot; one octave above the original chord (in many circles of theory transposition by an octave is supposedly &quot;always&quot; legal) and cause clashing overtone to the point many listeners thing you are playing out of key.<br/>     There are such gaps in 12TET where you can make things go wrong...and plenty theory (or having/obtaining a really good ear) you need to learn to avoid them. Of course no scale is going to have 0 places you can make something<br/>a-tonal...but I figure we can at least cut down on the % chance it could happen.  It&apos;s like comparing English to Spanish...English may have more poetic potential due to things like creative use of several synonyms that mean only slightly different things, but Spanish is considered much easier to learn by many because it has a good deal less grammatical exceptions to memorize.</p><p>      As such, I&apos;ve seen people who quickly learn to jam in 12TET often do so within the bounds of simple structures.  A side effect is so many bands run into the same or near-the-same things and making original music becomes harder (since there are much less simple theory combinations than advanced ones) without trying to push the edges of things like advanced chords every now and then.  The Beatles&apos; use of uncommon 4ths chords is a classic example.</p><p>    So 12TET, IMVHO, is solid and not too hard to learn, but running a bit stale and only a select few musicians have the talent to reveal truly fresh territory in it.  There is a forest of 12TET...and the remaining trees have top-quality wood, unfortunately it seems we&apos;ve used most of the lumber and need special saws to get at the remaining ones.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Who exactly is having problems jamming? &quot;<br/>    Ha, myself for one.  Countless times I&apos;ve composed something and thought &quot;oh, it&apos;s almost the same as something made before&quot;.  If you remember my old song &quot;Dreamist&quot;, one of my best rated songs and ones with the highest &quot;soul&quot; factor (supposedly), Din said I had the exact same chord progression as U2&apos;s &quot;With or Without You&quot; (and was right!).  So I started spicing it up with more complex chords along the same mood, but many people complained it sounded &quot;too academic&quot;.  I only with I could jam in such a way I&apos;d naturally run into both highly original and soulful music.<br/>  So far I&apos;ve had far better luck doing so with poly-phonically micro-tonal scales than anything else.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And I guess I should be<br/>signing my posts &quot;whiny bastard&quot; from now on eh? :-)&quot;<br/>   Ha...we musicians have pretty vicious opinions sometimes...it&apos;s all good. :-)<br/>***************<br/>BTW, a tips off the &quot;why do people like then buy music they find annoying&quot;?  I think what catchy music has in common is it&apos;s like a good joke (that you get instantly and don&apos;t have to think about much)...you hear it and it hits the edge of your ability to learn something quickly and (in a way) makes you feel smart, like you just solved a mystery of sorts and feel you&apos;re a quick road to conquering/master whatever clever feeling the song has in it.   Then, of course, you realize what you&apos;ve made it on top of isn&apos;t smart or deep and leave.  It&apos;s like the rush of meeting someone new who has something in common with you or the rush of buying something new on impulse that you&apos;re thrilled with getting &quot;cheaply&quot;...in my book.  A large part of the challenge on music and tuning is not only to make something that connects quickly and gives you a nice rush on the first listen...but reveals further fresh ideas even after several listens (old songs from &quot;The Cure&quot;<br/> come to mind).</p></div><h3><a id=87857 href="#87857">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2010 2:25:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;explain - from your view of popular  - why this cover has over half a<br/>million hits<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Ha8oeQIFk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Ha8oeQIFk</a>&quot;<br/>  You are indirectly asking me to explain factors like the singer&apos;s looks, lyrics, marketing of the original song, marketing by herself and friends, composition style...all which have nothing to do with tuning.<br/>  A much more fair and relevant challenge, IMVHO, would be to<br/>A) Make a copy of that song into a micro-tonal tuning with the exact same instrument and have her redo the vocals to match the tuning.<br/>B) Mix it under the same video and post it on youtube as another video.<br/>C) Compare which version listeners say they like more.</p><p>     Also, just because I watched the &quot;pants on the ground&quot; American Idol video, for example, doesn&apos;t mean I thought it was good...it merely means I thought it was amusing.  If I actually paid for something I wrote, bought memorabilia, and spent time reading his bios in music composer magazine though...that would obviously be a different story.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And go ahead and call me a bastard if you don&apos;t like hearing that<br/>music doesn&apos;t need &quot;ultra confident consonant tunings  and nine note<br/>chords&quot; to interest an audience.&quot;<br/>  I never said it did.  I said it needed a minimum degree of consonance.  Do you really think people are going to love music that sounds so dissonant you could swear the musician just doesn&apos;t know what he/she is doing, for example?  If not, you probably disagree with me a whole lot less than you&apos;ve admitted.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And as far as I can tell I am not putting words into your mouth. You talked again and again about consonance and 7, 8, 9 note chords as a goal.&quot;<br/>  I talked about it as a goal for its own sake, not to &quot;make popular music&quot;.  A side point is if I can make 7+ note chords, you&apos;d better believe you can break those chords into the sort of 4 note chords typically used in pop music pretty easily.  Again, it seems like you have the attitude that say, since Bill Sethares made a song in 10TET with a goal of consonance than he somehow much think pop music needs 10TET chords to be popular.  It&apos;s a ridiculous kind of conclusion to come to.</p><p>&gt;&quot;You&apos;ve made demonstrations, one after another, trying to obtain these goals.&quot;<br/>Thanks for the recognition: of course I try my best to put lots of effort into this community in general.</p><p>&gt;&quot;your concept of what &quot;popular music needs to be popular&quot;. (paraphrasing mind you)&quot;<br/>  The only things I&apos;ve said I think it needs (and I mean in general/on-the-average, not for every single listener) is to fall above a certain minimum level of consonance (at least enough so it doesn&apos;t make people shout &quot;out of key!&quot;) and has a similar certain minimum degree of polyphony while maintaining such a level of consonance.<br/>  How many pop songs (or songs from professional musicians in the USA period) do you know that don&apos;t have at least 4 note chords (especially out of those considered &quot;classics&quot;)?  I&apos;m pretty sure the list is not huge.</p><p>&gt;&quot;But I also don&apos;t deserve to be told I&apos;m acting like a bastard because you don&apos;t see what I&apos;m talking about.&quot;<br/>    I do, I just/simply don&apos;t agree with it.  You seem to be pushing your ideas on music composition (those that don&apos;t have anything to do with tuning) and saying it proving my tuning goals irrelevant.  Please...at least argue on the same subject (tuning for popular music, not composition/marketing/etc.)   BTW, I agree with you on the issue that music that ultimately succeeds must how soul, but I don&apos;t see how my tunings somehow contradict that process (of putting soul into music).</p></div><h3><a id=87858 href="#87858">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2010 3:03:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;So again... there&apos;s nothing wrong with &quot;beating.&quot; It&apos;s just perceivedas partial-dependent &quot;tremolo&quot; (whee), and I would hardly call tremolo&quot;dissonant.&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; But excessive tremolo creates its own sense of frequency.&nbsp; Hence if you take two sine waves about 16/15 apart you see what looks like one sine wave changing amplitude and that &quot;change&quot; is to a large extent the second frequency.&nbsp; I doubt that my own ears, Plomp and Llevelt, and the fact most people don&apos;t like hearing things like quickly stuttering/&quot;broken&quot; records could all be wrong.&nbsp; I&apos;m not saying beatless-ness is good (that would likely leave us with boring scales with all consecutive notes a 5th or octave so apart!)...but that excessive beating interferes with the brain&apos;s ability to hear what&apos;s going on.&nbsp; Put a huge and fairly quick &quot;high depth&quot; amplitude modulator/Tremelo/&quot;gargle&quot; effect over music and try to say what the chords are or digest/enjoy the full feel of them...not so easy is it?</p><p>I don&apos;t think that the fact that people don&apos;t like &quot;broken&quot; records<br/>has anything at all to do with beating.

Making mistakes that make 12TET atonal is quite easy...ever tried going to a random Guitar Center and realizing how many people &quot;trying equipment&quot; there are playing mostly sour chords?<br/>      &quot;?but I figure we can at least cut down on the % chance it could happen.?&quot;</p><p>=&gt; Mike, with all due respect, unless you are playing I- Ching<br/>like John Cage I have *no* idea how you are leaving jamming up to<br/>chance. ?<br/>    I&apos;m not talking about &quot;jamming&quot;...I&apos;m talking about the chance of hitting a &quot;hole&quot; in 12TET that makes it fairly easy to hit &quot;bum&quot; notes, as you call them.</p><p>=&gt;&quot;What?  Why do you think English is inherently more poetic<br/>than Spanish? Is there no skill involved in poetry?  This to me is an<br/>apples to oranges comparison.  Look up Federico Garc&iexcl;a Lorca.&quot;<br/>    No I don&apos;t, I&apos;m saying it appears to more flexibility that makes it easier to be poetic in than Spanish...not that using it &quot;instantly makes people into poets&quot;.  For example, the words &quot;taken&quot; vs. &quot;whisked&quot; away.</p><p>?&quot; ?without trying to push the edges of things like advanced chords<br/>every now and then.  The Beatles&apos; use of uncommon 4ths chords is a<br/>classic example. ?&quot;<br/>=&gt; Are you speaking of a suspended 4th like in For No One by the Beatles?  A suspended 4th is not uncommon.<br/>   Technicalities, technicalities.  My point is they were ahead of their time in what they did with chords.  I certainly didn&apos;t say what they did had never been done by other musicians.</p><p>=&gt; So, please explain is 12 tet hard or isn?t 12 tet hard?<br/>         It isn&apos;t hard...but it could still be made a good deal easier.</p><p>&quot;?but running a bit stale and only a select few musicians have the talent to reveal truly fresh territory in it.  ?&quot;<br/>=&gt; Maybe better said  all the low hanging fruit is now long gone?<br/>  Obviously, there isn&apos;t much left that&apos;s fully original which can be achieved through &quot;simple, easy to learn&quot; options in 12TET.</p><p>=&gt; Mike, with all due respect  you may have this issue but not<br/>everyone else does.  Think of all of the jazz and blues and rock<br/>musicians (like The Grateful Dead) who are known to jam on forever.<br/>Now certainly people have their talents and lacks ? I can&apos;t cover<br/>songs worth a crap and my singing isn&apos;t pleasant but I can certainly<br/>jam rock and blues and a touch of jazz  ? so *please* the whole world<br/>doesn?t have all the same issues.<br/>    Even Coldplay got sued for stealing Satriani&apos;s chord progression and such.  Again, my point is there&apos;s a high chance of running into the same options as an artist before you.  Billy Corgan also mentioned this issue in one of his interviews...and you&apos;d better believe he&apos;s talented.  I NEVER said we all have the same issues...but I&apos;m saying many people have some across this problem.  It&apos;s not like...oh man, I only came across this problem because of some bizarre lack of talent.</p><p>&gt;&quot;What I am saying is that improvisation (jamming) is a learned skill to some degree  a degree different for everyone.&quot;<br/>   Who said I meant jamming in that sense?  I meant jamming as in playing by feel...and actually specifically by not improvising but writing music from scratch on the spot IE Adlib without thinking about theory or correcting yourself to match anything...the exact opposite of playing it &quot;academically&quot;.  Playing to a commercial wouldn&apos;t count in that sense...because you&apos;d be trying to match the commercial.  I&apos;m sorry if I&apos;m not using the anal-retentively &quot;correct&quot; version of the word, but that&apos;s what I mean.<br/>************************************************</p><p>   Summary, 12TET is relatively easy to learn vs. many chord-capable micro-tonal scales (and viewed by many if not most people outside our &quot;little micro-tonal cult&quot; as such).  But there&apos;s still room for improvement and plenty of ways to royally screw up in 12TET theory that IMVHO could be guarded better against without losing expressive flexibility and encourage more to have the patience for learning music.  And even the best musicians (who are actually humble enough to admit it) often have trouble running into virtually the same progressions other bands they never have heard or known about use not because they have a weird talent problem, but because the low-hanging fruit in 12TET has almost completely been exhausted.</p><p>    I figure we can either deal with this and constructively work on multiple alternatives, or watch a whole lot of music go in one big circle so far as tunings like fresh chord progressions and (even at times) fresh leads.  Now how about now complaining about how standard music theory in 12TET is already &quot;not needing improvement&quot; and instead taking the challenge of trying to make positive alternatives to it (both so far as new tunings and chord theories to match)?   There&apos;s certainly no reason to just give up....</p></div><h3><a id=87867 href="#87867">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2010 10:11:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>When distinguishing the two species of Blackwood in 25-EDO it&apos;s nice to have a simple name for them, rather than saying &quot;the R=4 Blackwood and the R=4/3 Blackwood&quot;.

These were very useful as I could (and in the case of those comment, have often used your advice) simply take these back, &quot;covert&quot; them to fractions and scale terminology, and use them as options.

It started coming across as an insult when I gave an example of my own struggles with 12TET in composing and you said &quot;That doesn&apos;t mean anybody else has such problems&quot;, which appears to be very near directly implying I must be much more clueless about writing music than the average person.  Well...that and saying I made a statement about my supposedly saying &quot;popular musicians must use 9+ note chords&quot; when I never ever said such a thing and bringing it up over four times in a row again beating the dead horse back to life without any prompting.

After Chris mentioned the proper definition of polyphony, I never once used it in the improper way (far as the music theory vs. DSP/synth programming uses it) again on this board.  When Chris mentioned &quot;constant interval structure&quot; as a problem with my scales, I made a point of not repeating the mistake.  When Cameron mentioned the use of mirroring around the octave in scales and super-particular intervals and I tried them out and found how much more &quot;together&quot; they made my scales sound, I began using both concepts extensively.

I do read and listen a good deal and certainly don&apos;t try not to...and I certainly don&apos;t deserve the label of lazy, ignorant, or irresponsible.  If you want to do that sort of fire-starting, at least provide specific examples of things I said directly and know the context under which I said them.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And you are dead wrong about one thing: the standard musical terminology grew out of centuries-old practices that developed before 12 edo was<br/>the norm;&quot;<br/>     I never said that.   You won&apos;t find a quote where I did...dare you to (btw, quoting someone else &quot;claiming&quot; I said something does not count).  What I did say it that 12TET is the main modern standard for much of the world.  That and nothing more.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Free use of 9th and 11th  chords didn&apos;t appear until the 19th century,<br/>when 12 edo was gradually winning the &quot;tuning wars&quot;; this use of chords<br/>really grows out of a keyboard-oriented (i.e., 12 edo) approach rather<br/>than a vocal or non-keyboard orientation.  Now modern musical<br/>terminology is influenced by 19th-20th century practices&quot;<br/>    And that&apos;s what I&apos;ve been talking about this whole time, modern practices.  I never went into history, Chris did.  I started this thread as &quot;Love vs. Hate of 12TET&quot; not anything like &quot;12TET as the preferred theory through the entire history of music&quot;, a precedence which I&apos;ve always know is false.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>  One thing is pretty obvious; you haven&apos;t been listening to this thread from when it started and have not been taking my ideas in anything near their original context.<br/>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>&gt;&quot;It looks as though you want to use a synthesizer keyboard to create<br/>other types of tunings &quot;that people love,&quot; which is fine.

It&apos;s almost as if you are taking what Chris wrote without looking at what I wrote first or how this thread started and on what topic.</p><p>Look, here are some of the points<br/>1) 12TET as the prevailing modern theory, focusing specifically on the last 20 or so years of popular music.  Nothing about the Baroque era or anything like that.<br/>2) My own self-admitted goal of making scales with many easily accessible chords...not putting any implied limit more than about 4 notes as to how many tones are in a successful popular song (on the average IE realizing there can be songs with smaller chords but it&apos;s not the norm)<br/>3) My other self-admitted goal of coming up with a solution to counter the many musicians I&apos;ve heard who say &quot;12TET is hard enough&quot; as an excuse not to try micro-tonallity<br/>4) Asking for what likely makes music work to the public...issues like melody and harmony, but specifically related to the forms of math in tuning rather than things like how music is marketed or arranged or how talented the person playing it is (which is not directly related to how good a tuning is to the average person).<br/>5) Focus on the average musician.  Not just doctorates on composition or those with extensive live experience, but the average person.<br/>6) I don&apos;t think 12TET is terrible, I think it is &quot;good, but several different micro-tonal alternatives could be great&quot;.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And believe me, I&apos;m not throwing this in as a partisan of 12 edo --<br/>I&apos;ve been fighting a battle against uncritical acceptance of it for<br/>about a quarter century, both on the back end (interpretation of<br/>historical music) and front end (as a composer of 24 edo, 72 edo, and<br/>extended just music).  &quot;<br/>    Great.

I found about 4 that didn&apos;t summarize to x/11 or lower format fractions.  But I did notice something odd the the &quot;5ths&quot;.  Of course, some of the fifths were skewed.  Two of them hit 1.48148....not exactly a pretty interval as it doesn&apos;t round well within 13 cents of anything simple.  Another one was 1.44 and rounded well to 13/9, but obviously clashed with the second overtone since (3/2) / (1.44) = 1.041666 (very near the critical band dissonance maximum of 3/2).  So yet I digress I found some area where my scale flat out stunk.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      I thought about how City of the Asleep AKA &quot;Igs&quot; discussed the balance where using a near-perfect circle of 5ths often messes up possibilities of other complex interval and vice versa.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Then it dawned on me I would probably be well of with a &quot;hack&quot; that enabled me to do a bit of both by using weird/skewed 5ths such as 17/11, 20/13, 16/11, 19/13 that are close enough to the fifth not to cause major critical band dissonance and periodic enough not to cause bad periodicity between the two root tones in dyads but still deviant enough to form non-standard intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     So I proceeded and ended up with the following &quot;Skewed 5ths&quot; scale<br/>&gt; ******************************************************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt; series of modified 5ths   1.5 * 1.454545 * 1.53846 * 1.5 * 1.454545 * 1.5 * 1.45454545<br/>&gt;  7<br/>&gt; !<br/>&gt;  10/9<br/>&gt;  5/4<br/>&gt;  11/8<br/>&gt;  3/2<br/>&gt;  5/3<br/>&gt;  11/6<br/>&gt;  2/1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ******************************************************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The process I used to come up with the scale is as follows (note in some of these I divide by 2 to get the result)<br/>&gt; (1 )<br/>&gt; (3/2)<br/>&gt; 3/2 * 16/11 = 12/11 est.<br/>&gt; 12/11 * 20/13 = (5/3 est.)<br/>&gt; 5/3 * 3/2 = (5/4 est.)<br/>&gt; 5/4 * 16/11 = (11/6)<br/>&gt; 11/6 * 3/2 = (11/8)<br/>&gt; 11/8 * (11/6) = (2/1 est.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;   However I realize this is only one possibility using a circle of 5ths with the intervals representing the 5th alternating between 3/2, 17/11, 20/13, 16/11, 19/13...and I&apos;m not going to blindly accept my result as the best considering how many answers are possible.

If you tell me the terms,<br/>I&apos;ll gladly listen (as I did when you touched up my definition of<br/>polyphony)...but don&apos;t expect me to spend time studying music history<br/>and standard composition theory just so I can &quot;join the elite&quot; with<br/>you.<br/>     Also, your proper definition of polyphony involved separate<br/>voices on different timings each playing a tone while mine from my<br/>synthesizer/DSP background involved anything with multiple-root-tones<br/>playing at once...both of these definitions reference the idea of<br/>multiple tones playing at once...IE the essence/challenge in relevance<br/>to tuning and actually making scale is the same: making multiple tones<br/>match well together.

Rock / electronic music isn&apos;t<br/>usually very polyphonic.. .&quot;</p><p>  I was saying your piano solo was one extreme (to my ears it contained mostly dyads and chords that would likely be considered incomplete in pop music) and containing less extensive chords than most pop (IE around 4-tone chords and sometimes 3).</p><p>      Then you countered with an absolute extreme, claiming I somehow intended to write Motets (which, so far as I looked up on it, often contain very large chords, certainly over 4...much more than what I was hinting at).</p><p>  I then said</p><p>&gt;&quot;Again I think Marcus Satellite, for example, has reached a level of polyphony large enough to convince the average musician&quot;<br/>    And guess what...his music has 4 tone chords, is micro-tonal, and he manages to make a living off his music.  He doesn&apos;t exclusively use 6-note chords, or 9-note chords, or whatever.</p><p>You responded...<br/>&gt;&quot;I question your definition of polyphony. A piano solo can be extremely polyphonic.&quot;<br/>  And I agreed...at that time my definition of polyphonic simply meant &quot;playing many notes at once&quot;.  You hadn&apos;t told me of the proper definition, which means more than just &quot;many tones at once&quot; yet.</p><p>You also said...<br/>&gt;&quot;Counterpoint for solo violin? That is exactly what Bach achieved.<br/>It<br/>is primarily implied counterpoint, or &quot;compound melody&quot;. The most<br/>obvious example is in var 8&quot;&quot;</p><p>An I responded<br/>      &quot;Agreed, I&apos;m not arguing with you on this.  I agree solos can be<br/>polyphonic.&quot;</p><p>I was not saying your solo had what I consider moderately sized chords, but I agreed that other piano solos can.<br/>At this point you had brought up distant parts of music history several times while I was trying to focus on the last 15-20 years.</p><p>Then you finally said<br/>&quot;=&gt;Polyphonic  has to do with the number of parts, traditionally the number of melodies, in the piece being talked about&quot;<br/>(the proper definition of polyphonic meaning, referring to the number of melodies in the piece being played together rather than multiple notes in a chord being played together)</p><p>I then said<br/>&gt;&quot;When I turn my synth into &quot;poly&quot; mode all it does is allow more<br/>than one note to be played at once.&quot;<br/>  ...indirectly stating that I had not heard polyphony being used in the way you used it.  I was saying that people use the word differently.<br/>Yamaha (my synth manufacturer) misused the definition and I was acknowledging that, I was not saying they were right and you were wrong.</p><p>&gt;&quot; Anyhow, my point is&quot;.... &quot;anything with<br/>more than one note held at once, be it through multiple parts (as you<br/>said) or chords.&quot;<br/>  Anyhow meaning &quot;despite that the definition taught to me is wrong&quot;.  Otherwise I would have just said &quot;my point is...&quot;.  I was giving you credit, though you are apparently giving me a deaf ear for that effort.  I even described &quot;multiple parts&quot; to make it obvious I HAD been listening to you definition.  But you apparently ignored that too and blamed me for not listening anyhow.</p><p>&gt;&quot; Just...argh. ...you seem to care more about who&apos;s more correct about music history than actually trying to solve the problem at hand.&quot;<br/>     I was NOT saying I disregarded your definition of polyphony here, I was saying that your arguing at such huge length about it seemed unnecessary.  You could have just said &quot;actually polyphony formally means having multiple parts, traditionally melodies&quot; and just left it at that.  But instead you got up on your pedestal, brought up &quot;motets&quot;, whined about how I didn&apos;t think your piano solo was as extensive on mid-sized chords as pop music...and only then finally broke out the definition.

It&apos;s just....to me there&apos;s a point of diminishing returns where the added gain in musical flexibility is not quite worth the loss in dissonance.  And, to me, that again hits at around 12/11.</p><p>&gt;&quot;My point is that, to me, these narrow intervals you are working on are<br/>inadmissible because, as I said, if you listen carefully, or as you said &quot;stare at the sound&quot;, you can hear the dissonance.&quot;<br/>      Right, but then what do you plan to do with the 15/14 in your scale...never use it in chords?  Play C EF A on a standard (12TET) keyboard....it has a 17/16-ish interval in it yet (at least to me) still sounds fine because that tiny interval is &quot;balanced out&quot; by the wider ones.   Try it and let me know what you think....</p><p>&gt;&quot;You could argue that with a chord that lasts for 1/4 of a second<br/>(containing one of your narrow intervals) the dissonance cannot be heard but for me, if the chord isn&apos;t good when sustained, then it isn&apos;t good<br/>when &apos;stabbed&apos;.&quot;</p><p>    Want to know something bizarre?  I tried an extreme test once....I stacked a 9:10:11:12 chord together, a very clustered 4-tone chord.  Then I tried removing just the 10 and then just the 11 from it...and heard a difference in tone but a fairly slight one.<br/>  Then I compared it to the whole chord being played and barely sounded different...the only real difference was the 9:10:11:12 has this critical band &quot;buzz&quot; around it that made it harder to tell if either the 10 or 11 were there.<br/>    So the 9:11:12 and 9:10:12 barely sounded any different than the 9:10:11:12 minus the added buzz around the full 4-tone chord.  I repeated the experiment with just sine waves, same result.<br/>    I&apos;m pretty sure this hints that around 12/11 is where the human ear stops being able to resolve tones in chords as individual far as having very small intervals stacked together...and that even if I could find a way to get away with smaller intervals, there would be virtually no difference so far as how many degrees of expression.</p><p>    Meanwhile your scale, as it seems you&apos;ve designed it,  seems ideal for near-perfect major and minor triads and some good extended-JI 4-tone chords.<br/>    I&apos;m really interested how you handle diminished triads as 6/5 * 6/5 = 36/25, which is much closer to 13/9 than anything else I see obvious.

For me the general types of middle third are 11/9, 350 cent-ish (27/22 or whatever), and 16/13, and I not able to discern finer than that out of context. In context of course it is a different story- if your middle third is a pure simple interval from another in the tuning, tolerance is going to drop to a couple of cents right away.</p><p>There is another kind of third, those between the middle thirds and major and minor, like 26/21 on the major side and 330c on the minor. I love these, and can perform them in context (with accompaniment) but I cannot perform them out of the blue, as I still either drop to 6/5 or rise to 5/4, or go to the nearest middle third. Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to do these cold some day, as they are really nice, extremely subtle.</p><p>Anyway, apropos the multiple nature of this interval, there&apos;s a big failure of communication in your current discussion with Marcel, because he does not understand that even a Just interval can have multiple identities in context.

Or you can split the difference and call it sqrt(3/2), and etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I should add that there is another justification for using your tuning of 60/49 and not 49/40, even though in practice they would be hard to distinguish, as the 10/7 interval from 60/49 to 7/4 is anomalous, taking five scale steps and not four. So maybe it ought to be distinguished by being detuned less than a cent, whereas the other intervals are pure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you consider the neutral third to be an approximate 11/9, you now have four of them, two taking up two scale steps, and two three, with tuning very slightly different but in all cases less than four cents flat. Maybe your ear can tell the difference using the 60/49 tuning. There&apos;s just one 11/8 interval, so we don&apos;t need to worry about that.<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=88055 href="#88055">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2010 4:34:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Failure to use the correct word doesn&apos;t change the validity of Michael&apos;s criticism about the relative paucity of xenharmonic vertical sonorities- a paucity glaringly obvious to anyone on the &quot;outside&quot;.

But then I keep hearing people do things with 22 that I never thought possible so maybe I just didn&apos;t have the right frame of mind to figure out how to use this one.</p><p>Also for the record, I don&apos;t think Chris was using 17 as an example of a &quot;theoretically bad&quot; microtuning.  It really isn&apos;t theoretically &quot;bad&quot; for anything except meantone (since it is in one sense a &quot;superpythagorean&quot; temperament with sharp thirds...and meantone requires a nice low 5/4 approximation).  Now, my little pets of 16-, 18-, and 20-EDO, you can&apos;t theoretically get much worse than those!  I think only 13 and 11 look worse on paper.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>&gt;    Plus there are some nice &quot;odd&quot; larger (than the second) intervals like 11/9, 11/8, and 18/11 (actually, those two also show up in my scale) that really spice things up and some additional ones such as...making the scale both quite consonant so far as making large chords and quite deviant from 12TET at the same time.  The 11/9 interval seems to pop up all over the place, so anyone who likes the sound of that interval should definitely check the above MOS out.<br/>&gt;   This definitely qualifies as both fresh and fairly easy to learn.  And I certainly don&apos;t think that of most scales I run across.  17TET may indeed be able to work as a competitive alternative to 12TET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   You&apos;re right though, I&apos;m going to have to try at least one piece of music with it...and shame on me for passing up 17TET and putting it in the same &quot;hard to tune with harmonic timbres/instruments&quot; category as systems such as 10TET. :-D<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=88231 href="#88231">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2010 10:40:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Cameron you are just trying to mess with me.</p><p>We both know what the result will be - and it would be essentially<br/>equivalent to 12 tet with more intense beating.</p><p>Point of this is that my score shows that you were incorrect in your<br/>assertions concerning my piece.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Mon, Apr 26, 2010 at 1:21 PM, cameron &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, sorry about that!

This was a &quot;no cheating&quot; timbre,<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve called such timbres exactly that here on the list.

Why,<br/>&gt; Pianoteq.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; :-P<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s no need for us to argue, it&apos;s silly. You just render a version of<br/>&gt; your piece with an organlike sustain.

Also, I learn more about it, that doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m going to chain myself to it when making new scales.<br/>    Come to think of it (concerning common practice theory), I also asked Daniel about enharmonic equivalents and the apparent confusion that while a Cb is the same tone as B in 12TET it often is a completely different tone in other tunings, for example, and that 12TET apparently just tempers those two tones into one AKA &quot;fakes it&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=88247 href="#88247">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/26/2010 12:24:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If he was replying to me, I&apos;ll say I have nothing against considering the 7 also, which allows &gt; us to introduce our old friend, 64/63.</p><p>The difference between 8/7 and 9/8!

I started becoming seriously interested in micro-tonal music when I found myself in the following situations<br/>A) Making more and more complex chords and layered melodies with 12TET because I just love the energy that kind of composition gives...and then hearing &quot;those chords are too crazy to work with chromatic/12TET music theory&quot;.   That begged me to ask the question: are there other theories that will allow me to hack past this?<br/>B) Running into Bill Sethares work and seeing that, in many ways, he was doing just that: writing chord based music with the same sort of &quot;impossible&quot; intervals that people said they .  And using optimization of some cool idea called &quot;critical band dissonance&quot; to achieve this.<br/>   When I started composing with micro-tonality I first ran into 19TET and 34TET, both recommended for chord-based music.  But soon I found out there were so many more interesting options and had little clue how to put which option on top or learn all the theory required for each tuning.  Even under 19TET I found the most interesting options involved taking 8, and not 7 note subsets.  My ears were telling me to go where a lot of &quot;standard 19TET theory&quot; wasn&apos;t and I even felt the urge to &quot;bend&quot; certain notes into place, resulting in tons of un-evenly spaced intervals and something like &quot;hyper-MOS&quot; type scales.</p><p>      Around that point, I figured it would actually be easier just to listen to a few micro-tonal scales, see what intervals and symmetries I liked, and try to mix and match them into my own custom tunings and test them via composing knowing where the rules are (b/c I know the rules by virtue of having complete control over making the scale, lol)...than compose under and learn the required theory for every single possibility.

The challenge was to make a popular song with tall chords in a sour tuning.<br/>    Firstly, it turns out 17TET is NOT a particularly sour tuning and is in fact quite consonant in many many parts.</p><p>  Secondly, the tall chords in the first example were not that readily audible: Cameron and I didn&apos;t have any pet hypothesis...we simply couldn&apos;t hear your chords clearly with the odd piano timbre you chose.     However, the re-done version which used strings had such sustain and made it obvious the chords were there and made it obvious the score matched the music...but had a lot more dissonance than with the piano though still didn&apos;t sound too sour (rough guess, maybe 25% of people listening would think you simply didn&apos;t know how to play in tune and be disappointed).  As Cameron noted, you were using a bit of a &quot;cheat timbre&quot; and timbre obviously matters to consonance.</p><p>----------------------------<br/>  The other fact seems to be, you are a particularly talented micro-tonal composer, superb at finding sweet spots in chords and using phrasing and controlling sustain in such a way the dissonance doesn&apos;t boil over.  And if you started &quot;pushing&quot; something like 17TET (or certainly something more dramatic like 11TET)...chances are quality control would go down the drain and a good 94%+ of musicians simply would not be able to keep up, thus reinforcing the nasty public image of micro-tonality as a type of a-tonal music.</p><p>If you look at the example (from Daniel Sterns, another resident list expert) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY4UwgwV4RY....which">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY4UwgwV4RY....which</a> is quite well composed, but look at the comments:</p><p>&gt;&quot;uigrad I&apos;m sure that this is a very beautiful piece, but my stubborn ears<br/>still can&apos;t get past the tuning, and I&apos;ve listened to it 3 times now.<br/>:(  I really hope &quot;the masses&quot; do learn to appreciate microtonal,<br/>but it just doesn&apos;t seem likely.&quot;<br/>&gt;&quot;DieselBodine I do hear some Ives-ishness about your piece.  I&apos;ve been listening<br/>to Alois H&aacute;ba&apos;s &quot;Mother&quot; a quarter-tone opera lately and other works by<br/>him.  Microtonal music can be composed in an interesting way, but will<br/>be for the forseeable future quite strange to the masses of<br/>inexperienced ears. &#xFEFF; Luckily those masses are not 100% of humanity!<br/>Keep up the exploration&quot;</p><p>    Meanwhile if you look at Sethares work in 17TET (where he performed spectral alignment on the timbre to maximize consonance for his chords)<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mck2PcsZ44">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mck2PcsZ44</a><br/>One person even says</p><p>&#x9;* withindarkness I like how you didn&apos;t go for complete atonality, revel in extreme<br/>dissonance,  or try to showcase every interval... its hard to find<br/>xenharmonic music that strikes such a good balance.<br/>Definitely one of my favorite non-12tet pieces so far.  2 months ago .....there is virtually no qualm about the consonance and consistent comments about how relaxing/resolved the piece is as a whole.  There is of course useful contrast between consonance and dissonance, but at no point does it verge into out-of-control dissonance.  One could easily argue you do showcase intervals: you find the hard-to-find sweet spot intervals and pluck them out.  But it wouldn&apos;t exactly be sound marketing to ask musicians to try the &quot;switch&quot; to micro-tonal assuming they will have the patience to learn how to do that.</p><p>    And if you listen to the root notes chosen they actually don&apos;t seem to match many of the sweet intervals in common practice theory and don&apos;t appear to be &quot;cleverly picked out like wheat from chaff&quot; by the composer.<br/>    Yet they manage to sound very confident nonetheless.  IMVHO, Sethares tames the learning curve for 17TET by eliminating many if not most of the sour areas in the tuning (in his case, via spectral alignment), enabling more musicians, and not just the very most talented ones like yourself, to achieve &quot;non-weird&quot; sounding music with at least partly odd tunings (and again, I&apos;ve learned 17TET is not among the most dissonant tunings anyhow...things like 11TET are far worse).  If you try playing his song in 17TET without the spectral alignment consonance modification, I am almost certainly sure the video would get comments much more like the ones Daniel&apos;s video got IE &quot;impressive, but oh so weird&quot;.</p></div><h3><a id=88293 href="#88293">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2010 8:17:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(Igs) I checked out the album...your sense of groove and timbre matching is fantastic and in part enables you to over-ride the inherent usual lack of confidence and weirdness in some of the &quot;ex-consonant&quot; scales you use.  Just as a dissonant interval builds up too much tension, you cut the note, drop the beat, etc. ....and balance is achieved.</p><p>     I&apos;ll comment at length later but all I can say is for those few people so patient as you to learn/teach-oneself to play like that there are ways to make pop out of otherwise insanely dissonant scales and leverage the few sweet spots very intelligently to manage adequate counterpoint of resolve to all the &quot;controlled chaos&quot;.  :-)  Though I&apos;d still say you&apos;re more the exception rather than the standard (much like Chris)...and I mean that as a compliment.</p><p>     BTW, I&apos;ll try to convert the scale to an octave, but no guarantees (and it&apos;s inevitably going to make it more consonant lol).  Another odd note...I&apos;ve found out (via my ears, and despite theory) that 1.35 can actually sound quite resolved...it&apos;s as if the beating combines in such a way it forms a resolved mood (in the same way 11/8 AKA 1.375 sounds much more tense than the denominator suggests it should).  Weird, eh?  So I might have to change the 1.35 in the scale to something less manageable (hehehehe)...</p></div><h3><a id=88295 href="#88295">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2010 8:27:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael,</p><p>I was not doing anything with your challenge.

At any rate, I was able to play with the scale within Scala a bit, and I think you could do a lot better at challenging me!  The octave (or at least a very near octave) popped up in a few places for certain intervals, and going up or down a register opens up much more consonance.  This is the beauty of non-octave scales: they are quite dense with intervals if you take alternate registers into account, so it may look dissonant in one register but more consonant intervals will appear when you go higher or lower.  If you can fit this scale into an octave, you&apos;ll be making it MORE, not LESS, of a challenge for me.</p><p>Now, about &quot;MoaIL&quot;:<br/>My goal with that album was really to show that no tuning is *entirely* dissonant, and even if common intervals are significantly mistuned, uncommon ones might be pure enough to compensate.  I believe I am lucky to be untrained in classical theory, because I don&apos;t subconsciously try to force a tuning into an ill-fitting classical formula (the way Easley Blackwood often did on &quot;Microtonal Etudes&quot;).  I have no preconceptions about how music is supposed to work, so I follow my ears instead of a theory.  A few of the non-microtonalists who have picked up my microtonal guitars over the years have produced results that amaze even me, just by noodling around and going where the tuning wants to lead them.  I swear, too much theoretical background seems to frequently manifest as a hindrance in microtonality.  This is the only &quot;advantage&quot; I can think of that I might have over anyone else here that could explain why you see my results as the &quot;exception&quot; as opposed to the rule.</p><p>Regarding timbre: there are a few cases on that album where I de-emphasized the 3rd harmonic to keep a near-fifth from clashing too much, but by and large I stuck with harmonic timbres.  The pad sound at the beginning of &quot;Blinding White Darkness&quot; (which is in 13-EDO) is as harmonic as I could get, because I didn&apos;t want to hide the weirdness behind clever sounds.  On the tracks based on 5n-EDOs, I often used modeled plucked-string sounds with plenty of reverb, or else I used patches that emphasize odd harmonics (including the 3rd), and discovered that the &quot;beating&quot; caused by the 720-cent &quot;fifths&quot; didn&apos;t detract and actually added a nice &quot;shimmer&quot; to the sound--colorful, but not dissonant.  Hopefully this gives you something to think about?</p><p>Anyway, I hope either I can figure out how to get the FM7 to load your scale or that you can find a way to make it octave-repeating, because I&apos;d love to get on top of this challenge!</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      (Igs) I checked out the album...your sense of groove and timbre matching is fantastic and in part enables you to over-ride the inherent usual lack of confidence and weirdness in some of the &quot;ex-consonant&quot; scales you use.  Just as a dissonant interval builds up too much tension, you cut the note, drop the beat, etc. ....and balance is achieved.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      I&apos;ll comment at length later but all I can say is for those few people so patient as you to learn/teach-oneself to play like that there are ways to make pop out of otherwise insanely dissonant scales and leverage the few sweet spots very intelligently to manage adequate counterpoint of resolve to all the &quot;controlled chaos&quot;.  :-)  Though I&apos;d still say you&apos;re more the exception rather than the standard (much like Chris)...and I mean that as a compliment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      BTW, I&apos;ll try to convert the scale to an octave, but no guarantees (and it&apos;s inevitably going to make it more consonant lol).  Another odd note...I&apos;ve found out (via my ears, and despite theory) that 1.35 can actually sound quite resolved...it&apos;s as if the beating combines in such a way it forms a resolved mood (in the same way 11/8 AKA 1.375 sounds much more tense than the denominator suggests it should).  Weird, eh?  So I might have to change the 1.35 in the scale to something less manageable (hehehehe)...<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=88309 href="#88309">ðŸ”—</a>john777music &#x3C;jfos777@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2010 10:44:42 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Michael,</p><p>here&apos;s my best shot so far. I&apos;m sticking with my NPT scale: 1/1, 15/14, 9/8, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 8/5, 5/3, 9/5, 15/8 and 2/1. I&apos;m not going to temper it because, according to my calculator there are plenty of good dyads. Over a one octave range, there are only 53 &apos;bad&apos; intervals in harmony (value less than 0.05) according to my calculator. Also it seems that any interval wider than an octave is good.</p><p>Of these 53 &apos;bad&apos; intervals I suspect that some of them are within 6.7 cents (256/255) of a good interval and so the number of &apos;bad&apos; intervals might be reduced. More on this later.</p><p>You pointed out to me before that the 33/16 interval sounded dissonant and I checked it and concurred. I/we were using the wrong &apos;voice&apos;. Try the 33/16 interval using a Church Organ voice (voice #22 on my Yamaha keyboard) or a Classical Nylon String Guitar voice and it sounds okay.</p><p>As I said before, I ruled out intervals narrower than 5/6 because I could hear an annoying &apos;trill&apos;. Again, I was using the wrong voice. With the Church Organ voice the 7/6, 8/7 an 9/8 sound sweet.</p><p>If you haven&apos;t done so already, read chapters 4, 6, 7 and 10 of my book to get the gist of my system.

I&apos;ve had an idea for the longest time I could make a significant influence (not fame or fortune, but influence) on music with my ideas on beats and deeply layered harmonies for the last 5 years or so...often composing at least one new song a week.<br/>  I have come to the conclusion that I have a better chance of helping to expand what people think can be done with music by putting theories out there for other composers who have much more talent than myself to leverage.  To me composing is my own form of self-indulgence...fun and I&apos;d still do it if not a single person wanted to listen...but I have to face the facts I am nothing special at it nor can I apparently train myself to be: I&apos;m merely an average hobbyist musician.</p><p>   I get the impression you have at least some interest in passing along influence on these forums.</p><p>  And, don&apos;t get me wrong...a lot of your work is very good...but doubtfully good enough to make many musicians think &quot;hey, I need to learn how to play like that guy, let me buy said micro-tonal instruments and try it...almost regardless of the learning curve&quot;.   Heck even people like Neil Haverstick, who has been featured in Guitar World Magazine, seems to have a tricky enough time doing that sort of thing.<br/>    So if you are aiming in that direction I highly recommend you both work on your own tunings (instead of simply composing) and documenting patterns you see/use in composition so others can learn them more easily.  Well that and there&apos;s no benefit to be gained by talking down to people like me (saying I think you&apos;re wrong is acceptable, but saying your goal is stupid at best does nothing positive).

This scale is a rare example of 14 sounding more harmonically-consonant than 19--the septimal thirds in 19 are just too flat and sharp...they really GRIND, compared to the ones in 14.

Because the generator for these scales is ~250&cent;, i.e. between a major 2nd and a minor 3rd.  So how is Beep 7-limit and Bug 5-limit if they both temper out the same comma?  Does Beep temper out an additional 7-limit comma or something?</p><p>And here&apos;s something I DON&apos;T get about linear temperaments mapping to EDOs: let&apos;s look at 19-EDO.  It&apos;s a member of meantone, so it tempers 81/80 (the difference between 81/64 and 5/4), meaning it produces a near-5/4 by a chain of fifths.  This means that it will also have a good minor third (and in fact it does, an almost perfectly-Just 6/5).  However, it&apos;s ALSO a member of Bug--so it tempers out 27/25 and should thus collapse the minor third and minor whole-tone into the same interval.  It does and it doesn&apos;t--it has a near-250&cent; interval, but it also has an almost-perfect 10/9 and 6/5.  How can you &quot;temper out&quot; the difference between two intervals and yet still keep those two intervals in the temperament?   18-EDO&apos;s confusing in a similar way: it&apos;s a Father temperament, meaning 16/15 (the difference between 5/4 and 4/3) is tempered out, yielding an interval of 466.667&cent;...yet it still has a decent 5/4 approximation at 400&cent;.

And thank you, by the way, for all this personal<br/>&gt; &gt; instruction you&apos;re giving me in linear temperaments!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Both bug and beep temper out 27/25; the usual distinction is that beep<br/>&gt; is a 7-limit temperament, while bug is a 5-limit temperament (but in<br/>&gt; some earlier posts the two names were used interchangeably). It has a<br/>&gt; reasonably good approximation of an Indonesian pelog scale.

The way the scale is built to revolve around 7TET-like &quot;semi-tones&quot; is designed to give a fairly consistent way to keep track of interval tension.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Have you ever stopped to consider that even if you come up with a scale<br/>that SOUNDS wonderful no matter which notes you put together, the fact<br/>that it will have relatively so many MORE interval-classes than a 12-tET major scale might actually make it more difficult to learn overall?&quot;<br/>         Not really because (if I have it right) doesn&apos;t the above assume you learn interval classes to know which ones represent tensity vs. relaxation?  Truth is you&apos;re right though...my scales have tons of interval classes...just about the only areas they don&apos;t touch are the range from 11/6-2/1 and 5/3 to 7/4.   And if you want to reduce to x/y type format you have x/2, x/3, x/4, x/5, x/8, x/9, x/10 and x/11 (I&apos;m pretty sure there are no x/7&apos;s at least within a single octave).  I don&apos;t think this is a bad thing as the tonal color possibilities seem vast in theory and, so far that I&apos;ve used them to compose with, FEEL vast.  The idea is you get a whole lot of different flavors of tonal color...but have an easy way to keep track of &quot;consonance vs. dissonance&quot; tensity...so the result sounds both mysterious and predictable/easy-to-learn/easy-to-follow at the same time.</p><p>         So I figure, at least in this &quot;odd&quot; case, why think in terms of interval classes anyhow?   The idea is that closer tones always develop more tension and further away tones develop less...as opposed to, say, the relatively dissonant major seventh in 12TET and the sudden exponential increase in dissonance in 12TET between using semi-tones and whole tones.</p><p>     The goal is to provide an alternative to the &quot;class&quot; system and historical stereotypes like &quot;7ths are always dissonant&quot; and simply by able to &quot;slide&quot; dissonance up and down by making more/less clustered chords...rather than trying to capture interval classes &quot;tension roles&quot;.  Classes seem to be full of exceptions...my scale system aims toward a common rule of denser=tenser with the hope people will find that single criteria much easier to keep track of.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And have you given much thought about how, once you find a good 7 to<br/>10-note scale, it might be &quot;expanded&quot; to allow for changing keys?&quot;<br/>    Yet I digress...such would be very hard to do with an acoustic instrument.  Electronically it&apos;s another story...you could very easily have a transpose button that pitch-shifts the root to the second note of the scale and all other tones by the same amount.  Exactly transposition, far as I know, has always been a fairly TET exclusive thing...and tunings which do it well tend to be very near equal temperaments.</p><p>   HOWEVER...once I come up with a scale I&apos;m at least 95% happy with (I hated the sour 5ths in the last version of my scale though I liked virtually all the other intervals, hence I&apos;m working on a new one) I will start composing with it almost excessively to &quot;benchmark&quot; it.  If that all turns out well I will start asking people like you if they think an existing TET or TET-like tuning can match it.  But I realize there are no guarantees as the TET to match it might be huge and unrealistic for acoustic instruments.

The more I think about it....concentrating on o-tonal/u-tonal relationships in anything over dyads seems to throw me right back into existing tunings and pushes me away from being able to focus more on root-tone critical band relationships and getting those smaller 12/11, 11/10 dyads without also getting obscenely out-of-tune-sounding tones nearing 3/2 or a good few nasty conflicts in the 6/5-5/4 &quot;third&quot; range.

I&apos;m not going to anal-retentively force everything into things like 3:4:5&apos;s and 4:5:6&apos;s.  Come to think of it &quot;even&quot; 12TET does not &quot;follow&quot; any sort of simple o-tonal/u-tonal relationship....it simply falls close enough that the mind &quot;rounds the error off&quot;.   You get the same &quot;are you using this as a 10/9 or 9/8?&quot; kind of &quot;en-harmonic&quot; questions you get in 12TET.

Though what I really need is some people to help me test the final versions...particularly people who do not try to rate the system by, say, how much a triad sounds like a standard triad or how much the tensity of my &quot;7th&quot; is like a standard 7th...but rather how easy (or hard?) the scale is to play when you just think in terms of up-down for melodies and clustered/un-clustered for tensity. :-)</p><p>_,_._,___</p></div><h3><a id=88446 href="#88446">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2010 4:15:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      A foreward to my latest scales...the final goal of the design is to get to the point where there are so few harmonically sour combinations possible in the scale theory is not required beyond considering how clusterer/unclustered you want parts of your music to be...</p><p>I did a complete survey of the 7 note strictly proper scales of 31 equal a few years back, the results of which may be relevant to your quest.

Like I said, even though your scale could be, well, &quot;idiot-proof&quot; in terms of being able to make good music in it, the theoretical underpinnings of it are, well, a heap of rubble.  The only thing relating the pitches together is that you like all of them and that you&apos;ve (almost) got them arranged in such a way that you can play any of them together and they will sound &quot;good&quot; (to your ears, or according to one of the various theories of consonance you like).  So it will be a scale that&apos;s easy to play but DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND, and that perhaps the reason it&apos;s such a challenge for you to &quot;iron it out&quot; has to do with the fact that there&apos;s no logical structure inherent in it...its only rules are that it must sound &quot;good&quot; to you, and it must be mathematically possible.</p><p>So sure, it might sound killer, but how will you relate it to what the average musician already knows?    This scale looks to be as different from the major scale as night is to day.</p><p>Also, since your scale is unequal, how can the rule &quot;denser = tenser&quot; really apply?  Tension will vary with the size of the intervals involved, so depending on what degree of the scale you form a chord on, you might have more or less tension given the variance in intervallic spacing.  This adds back in that old variable, which was indeed found in meantone and well-temperaments but vanished when equal temperament arrived.  Before equal temperament arrived, a music student had to learn the properties of each key individually, which chords were rough and which were smooth...with your scale, one won&apos;t be able to simply learn that a 1-3-5 triad is smooth, one will have to learn which intervals to use on which degree of the scale to form a chord of the desired &quot;feel&quot;.  And since certain chords will only be possible on certain degrees, this limits the versatility of the scale.  So rather than being simply up/down for melody and denser=tenser for harmony, it becomes rather more complex!</p><p>I&apos;m not trying to dissuade you from your path, just trying to point out some difficulties that the average musician might find with your scale (as I&apos;m about as average a musician as they come!)</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      A foreward to my latest scales...the final goal of the design is to get to the point where there are so few harmonically sour combinations possible in the scale theory is not required beyond considering how clusterer/unclustered you want parts of your music to be...in other words the only rule that really applies in many cases cluster/un-clustered = tense/relaxed with very few exceptions.  The way the scale is built to revolve around 7TET-like &quot;semi-tones&quot; is designed to give a fairly consistent way to keep track of interval tension.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Have you ever stopped to consider that even if you come up with a scale<br/>&gt; that SOUNDS wonderful no matter which notes you put together, the fact<br/>&gt; that it will have relatively so many MORE interval-classes than a 12-tET major scale might actually make it more difficult to learn overall?&quot;<br/>&gt;          Not really because (if I have it right) doesn&apos;t the above assume you learn interval classes to know which ones represent tensity vs. relaxation?  Truth is you&apos;re right though...my scales have tons of interval classes...just about the only areas they don&apos;t touch are the range from 11/6-2/1 and 5/3 to 7/4.   And if you want to reduce to x/y type format you have x/2, x/3, x/4, x/5, x/8, x/9, x/10 and x/11 (I&apos;m pretty sure there are no x/7&apos;s at least within a single octave).  I don&apos;t think this is a bad thing as the tonal color possibilities seem vast in theory and, so far that I&apos;ve used them to compose with, FEEL vast.  The idea is you get a whole lot of different flavors of tonal color...but have an easy way to keep track of &quot;consonance vs. dissonance&quot; tensity...so the result sounds both mysterious and predictable/easy-to-learn/easy-to-follow at the same time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          So I figure, at least in this &quot;odd&quot; case, why think in terms of interval classes anyhow?   The idea is that closer tones always develop more tension and further away tones develop less...as opposed to, say, the relatively dissonant major seventh in 12TET and the sudden exponential increase in dissonance in 12TET between using semi-tones and whole tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      The goal is to provide an alternative to the &quot;class&quot; system and historical stereotypes like &quot;7ths are always dissonant&quot; and simply by able to &quot;slide&quot; dissonance up and down by making more/less clustered chords...rather than trying to capture interval classes &quot;tension roles&quot;.  Classes seem to be full of exceptions...my scale system aims toward a common rule of denser=tenser with the hope people will find that single criteria much easier to keep track of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;And have you given much thought about how, once you find a good 7 to<br/>&gt; 10-note scale, it might be &quot;expanded&quot; to allow for changing keys?&quot;<br/>&gt;     Yet I digress...such would be very hard to do with an acoustic instrument.  Electronically it&apos;s another story...you could very easily have a transpose button that pitch-shifts the root to the second note of the scale and all other tones by the same amount.  Exactly transposition, far as I know, has always been a fairly TET exclusive thing...and tunings which do it well tend to be very near equal temperaments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    HOWEVER...once I come up with a scale I&apos;m at least 95% happy with (I hated the sour 5ths in the last version of my scale though I liked virtually all the other intervals, hence I&apos;m working on a new one) I will start composing with it almost excessively to &quot;benchmark&quot; it.  If that all turns out well I will start asking people like you if they think an existing TET or TET-like tuning can match it.  But I realize there are no guarantees as the TET to match it might be huge and unrealistic for acoustic instruments.

I&apos;m certainly not just pulling ratios out of my hat at random.</p><p>&gt;&quot;So it will be a scale that&apos;s easy to play but DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND&quot;<br/>   That makes a bit more sense IE I agree that beyond looking at the tempered-from-not-too-uncommon JI dyads, the rest of the scale is a balance between combination of critical band dissonance analysis, root-tone symmetry, and, yes, some aethetics.  It&apos;s not easy to prove in one shot because one would have to prove those parts and then link them together and explain why the scale balances/chooses how much to stress each part the way it does.  Academically, yes, it&apos;s going to be a tricky little bastard to handle as a &quot;single&quot; scientific idea...because it&apos;s rather an aesthetic balance between several well-proven scientific theories.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Also, since your scale is unequal, how can the rule &quot;denser = tenser&quot;<br/>really apply? Tension will vary with the size of the intervals involved&quot;<br/>  Well it&apos;s not perfectly equal, but does merge on 7TET.  Another thing: 12TET certainly is not &quot;equal&quot; because the only thing equal about it is the root-tone spacing: the periodicity and overtone spacing is another story. Plus a huge percentage of the steps are whole-tones and then you have two half-steps...there&apos;s nothing equal about that even if you don&apos;t consider periodicity and what happens with the overtones. Between my 9/8 and 12/11 step size there&apos;s a 1.03 ratio change...between a half and whole step in 12TET...there&apos;s a 2.00 ratio change.</p><p>&gt;&quot;So sure, it might sound killer, but how will you relate it to what the<br/>average musician already knows? This scale looks to be as different<br/>from the major scale as night is to day. &quot;<br/>  You can&apos;t use &quot;backward compatibility&quot; to 12TET because you&apos;re right: there is virtually none.   I&apos;m betting most people who learn 12TET are really learning to balance tension vs. relaxation through sound...IE that&apos;s the purpose.  Just as a doorknob doesn&apos;t work because it works like a doorknob (it works because it has the function of opening the door, just like an automatic door motor), I don&apos;t see why its not acheiving the desired result in a different way alone would be a barrier to learning it.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Tension will vary with the size of the intervals involved&quot;<br/>  There are a few variables, including the critical band dissonance of the root tones, the periodicity of the root tones, the consonance/intersection of the harmonics, and the general aesthetic feel of an interval.  Since all of these are involved, I try to keep the average of these about the same, rather than worrying about say, only the root tones and relationships to the tonic the same.  And again, &quot;even&quot; concerning root tones, I&apos;ll bring up the fact that the area around 12/11 is only about 1.03 times smaller than the area around 9/8.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not trying to dissuade you from your path, just trying to point out<br/>some difficulties that the average musician might find with your scale<br/>(as I&apos;m about as average a musician as they come!)&quot;</p><p>     I completely understand, don&apos;t worry. :-)  I agree with you a way to, say, convert my scale into some sort of easily transposable form would be a significant perk.  I also agreed that the root-tone &quot;constant distance from all tonics&quot; relationship is not ideal...but still feel confident that 1.03 or so &quot;off&quot; is not too dramatic.  The equal-distance tonic isn&apos;t there, but neither is, say, the problem where you try and play a C major chord followed by an E-major chord to &quot;maintain consonance level&quot; and end up out of key since the G# in E G# B is out of key in the key of C (though this something someone like Debussy would do a lot and &quot;magically&quot; alter the melodies to follow the &quot;shift&quot;).<br/>     An analogy, I consider it like teaching someone who only knows how to skate how to bicycle ride.  I don&apos;t think said person would have a hard time at all in most ways.</p><p>    The two points I really &quot;fear&quot; here as needing a fair deal more &quot;conquering&quot; are a way to explain the system quickly to academics and a way to convince people not to fall into old habits IE don&apos;t expect things like &quot;major triad&quot; fingering to equal maximum consonance.  In the same way you&apos;d tell someone learning how to bicycle ride who already can skate that they can&apos;t turn simply by pushing down and leaning toward one foot (as they have to control the handlebars and &quot;countersteer&quot;).</p></div><h3><a id=88454 href="#88454">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/28/2010 7:43:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>cityoftheasleep wrote:<br/>&gt; 27/25 = the difference between a 9/5 and a 5/3, or a 6/5 and a<br/>&gt; 10/9...AHHH now it makes sense!

It&apos;s a member of meantone, so it tempers<br/>&gt; 81/80 (the difference between 81/64 and 5/4), meaning it produces a<br/>&gt; near-5/4 by a chain of fifths.  This means that it will also have a<br/>&gt; good minor third (and in fact it does, an almost perfectly-Just 6/5).<br/>&gt; However, it&apos;s ALSO a member of Bug--so it tempers out 27/25 and<br/>&gt; should thus collapse the minor third and minor whole-tone into the<br/>&gt; same interval.  It does and it doesn&apos;t--it has a near-250&iuml;&iquest;&half; interval,<br/>&gt; but it also has an almost-perfect 10/9 and 6/5.  How can you &quot;temper<br/>&gt; out&quot; the difference between two intervals and yet still keep those<br/>&gt; two intervals in the temperament?   18-EDO&apos;s confusing in a similar<br/>&gt; way: it&apos;s a Father temperament, meaning 16/15 (the difference between<br/>&gt; 5/4 and 4/3) is tempered out, yielding an interval of 466.667&iuml;&iquest;&half;...yet<br/>&gt; it still has a decent 5/4 approximation at 400&iuml;&iquest;&half;.  How does this work?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; -Igs</p><p>You&apos;ve got different mappings of 19 in that case. Meantone has the usual &lt;19, 30, 44] mapping (2/1 is 19 steps, 3/1 is 30 steps, 5/1 is 44 steps). If you use 4 steps of 19 as a bug generator, you end up with &lt;19, 30, 45]: this usage of 19 has a less accurate approximation of 5/1. So these are technically two different temperaments, even though it&apos;s the same EDO.</p><p>Similarly with 18-EDO: if you use it as a father temperament, you&apos;ve got &lt;18, 29, 43], while &lt;18, 29, 42] is the 18-ET mapping with the decent 5/4 approximation. Different ET mappings, same EDO.</p></div><h3><a id=88468 href="#88468">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2010 9:16:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 28 April 2010 21:05, cityoftheasleep &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And here&apos;s something I DON&apos;T get about linear temperaments<br/>&gt; mapping to EDOs: let&apos;s look at 19-EDO. &nbsp;It&apos;s a member of<br/>&gt; meantone, so it tempers 81/80 (the difference between 81/64<br/>&gt; and 5/4), meaning it produces a near-5/4 by a chain of fifths.<br/>&gt; &nbsp;This means that it will also have a good minor third (and in fact<br/>&gt; it does, an almost perfectly-Just 6/5). &nbsp;However, it&apos;s ALSO a<br/>&gt; member of Bug--so it tempers out 27/25 and should thus collapse<br/>&gt; the minor third and minor whole-tone into the same interval. &nbsp;It<br/>&gt; does and it doesn&apos;t--it has a near-250&cent; interval, but it also has an<br/>&gt; almost-perfect 10/9 and 6/5. &nbsp;How can you &quot;temper out&quot; the<br/>&gt; difference between two intervals and yet still keep those two<br/>&gt; intervals in the temperament? &nbsp; &lt;snip&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s why I call it a no-fives temperament.  It works with the best<br/>mappings of 19 and 29 to 3 and 7.  You&apos;ll eventually get 5 mapped, but<br/>not in the pentatonic.  I don&apos;t know why people talk about bug<br/>instead.</p><p>                           Graham</p></div>
