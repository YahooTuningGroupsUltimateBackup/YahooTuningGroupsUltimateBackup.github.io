I have come to believe just intonation to comprise single integer ratios without any further ado. The fact that there is a mixture of both Pythagorean 3-limit intervals, 5-limit harmonic intervals and others much higher primes in this scale convinced me that it&apos;s function is more like that of a well-temperament than a pure just intonation model.

The purpose of this document is to show that Western tonal music is easily and completely expressed on paper with 35 tones concentrated in 12 regions whereby corresponding enharmonicities are discerned. This has probably been said countless times before, in Turkey particularly by Yalcin Tura. Any less pitches than 35 would mean that some enharmonical tones are skipped.

The notation system used in your Scala table does not agree with your stated topic title. Instead, you should use the notation system with only standard single and double accidentals. Otherwise this discussion becomes very difficult.</p><p>  2. The set of 35 is in no sense more &quot;closed&quot; than any other arbitrary set. Instead, it is a set of 31 (eliminate E##, B##, Fbb, and Cbb from the 35) which was often considered &quot;closed&quot; in the Renaissance and early and middle Baroque periods. In meantone tuning, it has two step sizes, unlike the three step sizes of the set of 35 you propose. The three step sizes make reckoning intervals according to number of steps virtually useless. Not so for two step sizes, distributed evenly around the octave.

I realize that I made a slip the previous time when I said &grave;step sizes&grave;.<br/>It should have been &grave;number of steps&grave; instead. What I mean is, you gave this<br/>pattern for A aeolean for 22-TET before:</p><p>&quot;...22-tET aeolian is 4-1-4-4-1-4-4...&quot;</p><p>And pointed out to me that the pattern must be consistent throughout the<br/>scale. But the pattern is not consistent in the 35 tones arrived at by:</p><p>F C G D A E B F#C#G#D#A#E# B# Fx Cx Gx Dx Ax Ex Bx (20 fifths up)<br/>(F) Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Cb Fb Bbb Ebb Abb Dbb Gbb Cbb Fbb (14 fifths down)</p><p>for:</p><p>D-E-F-G-A<br/>-6-3-6-5-</p><p>E-F#-G-A-B-<br/>-6-3-5-6-</p><p>(I should not have said that F is the tonic, it is rather the fundamental<br/>tone on which the fifths are concatenated)</p><p>I want to understand the relevance of your previous statement that &grave;the<br/>pattern should be the same when modulating from one key to another.&grave; This is<br/>afterall the prime argument you had put forth against my approach where I<br/>approximated the pythagorean values for apotome and limma for scales with<br/>modified fifth generators.</p><p>I have made the correction you pointed out to the document in question:<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/Complete%20Set%20of%20Enharmonics.pdf">http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/Complete%20Set%20of%20Enharmonics.pdf</a><br/>I hope you can tell me if I made a mistake this time. The fact that there is<br/>one less intermediate tone between G and A as compared to those between<br/>F-G or A-B is what hampers the pattern of modulation. Is it because I am<br/>needlessly looking for a symmetry where none should exist? Does the<br/>&grave;number of steps&grave; consistency only sought for in equal temperaments?</p><p>You say that the &grave;concentric tones&grave; idea which conceives the above-given 35<br/>tones to reside within 12 enharmonical regions is unfounded. But dear Paul,<br/>you should know that Professor Yalcin Tura here claims that even before I.<br/>If we Turkish musicians are so blatantly misinformed about Classical-<br/>Romantic Western theory, then I believe a knowledgable person like<br/>yourself should visit Istanbul soon and lecture us all on this matter lest<br/>we go about spreading our nonsense to deaf ears.</p><p>So if I understand you correctly, some of these double-flatted and<br/>double-sharped accidentals (namely Ex, Bx, Fbb, Cbb) can be omitted<br/>altogether without damaging the musical context given on measures 5, 13, 25<br/>and 31 in my paper? And you deem it permissable in Classical-Romantic theory<br/>that Bbbb could be employed when a musician decided in the most unlikely<br/>event that it would be prudent to descend a fifth below Fbb? Would<br/>this not be a breach of the number 35 as encompassing all the double sharps<br/>and double flats?

Do you imply that Ex,<br/>&gt; &gt; Bx, Fbb and Cbb are never used in Western Music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know whether or not you can find any examples<br/>&gt; in the literature, but it does not matter. What I<br/>&gt; imply by &quot;naturals and standard single and double<br/>&gt; accidentals&quot; is the 35-tone set that you brought up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. The set of 35 is the natural outcome of including<br/>&gt; &gt; all the double apotomes in the scale where the tonic<br/>&gt; &gt; is F,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The scale of the tonic is F?

Nothing has to be<br/>&gt; disregarded. If you look at your own numbers, the<br/>&gt; ratios/cents that is, you&apos;ll see that the distance<br/>&gt; from F to G is the same as the distance between G and<br/>&gt; A, despite the fact that you have happened to find<br/>&gt; more intermediate tones, in your set of 35, between F<br/>&gt; and G than between G and A.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have observed by ear that meantone tuning does not<br/>&gt; &gt; reflect classical-romantic practice of semitone<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals. I&apos;m not sure what you mean by saying that<br/>&gt; &gt; the table does not agree with the topic. Do you mean<br/>&gt; &gt; the E53 notation system?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, the notation in the table should be showing the<br/>&gt; same set of notes as you enumerate above it, in your<br/>&gt; musical examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The<br/>&gt; &gt; purpose of this document is to show that Western<br/>&gt; &gt; tonal music is easily and completely expressed on<br/>&gt; &gt; paper with 35 tones concentrated in 12 regions<br/>&gt; &gt; whereby corresponding enharmonicities are discerned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is absolutely unfounded, in my view. It would be<br/>&gt; as if one assumed, based on its 26 letters, that<br/>&gt; English had 26 sounds. But worse.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This has probably been said countless times before,<br/>&gt; &gt; in Turkey particularly by Yalcin Tura. Any less<br/>&gt; &gt; pitches than 35 would mean that some enharmonical<br/>&gt; &gt; tones are skipped. We would not want to do that in<br/>&gt; &gt; notation, would we?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ozan, there is nothing special about the stopping<br/>&gt; point of 35 tones. If a composer wishes to use the<br/>&gt; note Fbb in music, then certainly that same composer<br/>&gt; could wish to harmonize that note a fifth below, and<br/>&gt; would then be forced to write Bbbb. But I would not be<br/>&gt; surprised if Fbb has never been used, since it would<br/>&gt; almost always have been elided through an enharmonic<br/>&gt; shift to G, and in the era before enharmonic<br/>&gt; equivalencies were assumed, using even as many as 31<br/>&gt; notes in notation was at the far extreme end of<br/>&gt; enharmonic experimentation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt; Paul<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=56496 href="#56496">ðŸ”—</a>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@superonline.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/21/2004 7:06:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul, your explanations are very succinct and clear.</p><p>1.

I realize that I made a slip the previous time when I said &grave;step<br/>  &gt;sizes&grave;.<br/>  &gt;It should have been &grave;number of steps&grave; instead. What I mean is, you gave<br/>  &gt;this<br/>  &gt;pattern for A aeolean for 22-TET before:</p><p>  &gt;&quot;...22-tET [superpythagorean] aeolian is 4-1-4-4-1-4-4...&quot;</p><p>  22-equal step sizes are proportional to cents. So I might as well have written</p><p>  &quot;...22-tET aeolian is ...218.18 - 54.55 - 218.18 - 218.18 - 54.55 - 218.18 - 218.18&quot;.</p><p>  Or I might have used frequency ratios instead and written,</p><p>  &quot;...22-tET aeolian is 1.1343 - 1.032 - 1.1343 - 1.1343 - 1.032 - 1.1343 - 1.1343&quot;</p><p>  Either way, what I meant to refer to were the actual, physical interval sizes, and particularly the fifths (and fourths), all six of which, in this superpythagorean scale, should equal the best &apos;fifth&apos; of 22-equal, and not any other 22-equal interval -- for no others will be able to substitute for the best &apos;fifth&apos;.</p><p>  &gt;And pointed out to me that the pattern must be consistent throughout<br/>  &gt;the<br/>  &gt;scale.</p><p>  I meant the pattern in cents, and specifically the 709-cent &apos;fifths&apos; that occur at six positions in this scale. There is no other acceptable &apos;fifth&apos; that exists in 22-equal.</p><p>  &gt; But the pattern is not consistent in the 35 tones arrived at by:</p><p>  &gt;F C G D A E B F#C#G#D#A#E# B# Fx Cx Gx Dx Ax Ex Bx (20 fifths up)<br/>  &gt;(F) Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Cb Fb Bbb Ebb Abb Dbb Gbb Cbb Fbb (14 fifths down)</p><p>  &gt;for:</p><p>  &gt;D-E-F-G-A<br/>  &gt;-6-3-6-5-</p><p>  Whatever you&apos;re counting here, it clearly isn&apos;t cents or anything proportional to it.</p><p>  &gt;E-F#-G-A-B-<br/>  &gt;-6-3-5-6-</p><p>  Likewise.</p><p>  &gt;I want to understand the relevance of your previous statement that &grave;the<br/>  &gt;pattern should be the same when modulating from one key to another.&grave;<br/>  &gt;This is<br/>  &gt;afterall the prime argument you had put forth against my approach where<br/>  &gt;I<br/>  &gt;approximated the pythagorean values for apotome and limma for scales<br/>  &gt;with<br/>  &gt;modified fifth generators.</p><p>  Yes, the pattern in cents; and especially its effect on the tuning of the intervening fifths, in cents.</p><p>  &gt;I have made the correction you pointed out to the document in question:<br/>  <a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/Complete%20Set%20of%20Enharmonics.pdf">http://www.ozanyarman.com/files/Complete%20Set%20of%20Enharmonics.pdf</a><br/>  &gt;I hope you can tell me if I made a mistake this time. The fact that<br/>  &gt;there is<br/>  &gt;one less intermediate tone between G and A as compared to those between<br/>  &gt;F-G or A-B is what hampers the pattern of modulation.</p><p>  There is no hamperament to the pattern of modulation in the system you illustrate here. The intermediate tones are no more hamperament than the Eiffel Tower would be for my getting on a plane in New York and visiting you in Istanbul. The interval sizes, in cents, of the two pentachords in question are identical. Most importantly, the fifths (and fourths) are identical.</p><p>  &gt;Is it because I<br/>  &gt;am<br/>  &gt;needlessly looking for a symmetry where none should exist? Does the<br/>  &gt;&grave;number of steps&grave; consistency only sought for in equal temperaments?</p><p>  Partially, yes, because only there does the number of steps uniquely determine the size of the interval in cents. It&apos;s also useful for some purposes in &apos;distributionally even&apos; scales, especially the 7-note diatonic scale, but also the Pythagorean-12, -29, -41, and -53 note scales, and the Meantone-19, -31, . . . note scales.</p><p>  &gt;You say that the &grave;concentric tones&grave; idea which conceives the<br/>  &gt;above-given 35<br/>  &gt;tones to reside within 12 enharmonical regions is unfounded. But dear<br/>  &gt;Paul,<br/>  &gt;you should know that Professor Yalcin Tura here claims that even before<br/>  &gt;I.<br/>  &gt;If we Turkish musicians are so blatantly misinformed about Classical-<br/>  &gt;Romantic Western theory, then I believe a knowledgable person like<br/>  &gt;yourself should visit Istanbul soon and lecture us all on this matter<br/>  &gt;lest<br/>  &gt;we go about spreading our nonsense to deaf ears.</p><p>  What can I say? If you wish to subject my messages to you to the critique of any qualified lecturer in Western Music, preferably one fully engaged in the performance and scholarship of said music, I&apos;d be delighted, and I&apos;m confident that you&apos;ll find basic agreement.</p><p>  &gt;So if I understand you correctly, some of these double-flatted and<br/>  &gt;double-sharped accidentals (namely Ex, Bx, Fbb, Cbb) can be omitted<br/>  &gt;altogether without damaging the musical context given on measures 5,<br/>  &gt;13, 25<br/>  &gt;and 31 in my paper?</p><p>  I think you&apos;re continuing to misunderstand my remark about the set of 31 notes. If it is too elusive to think about now, please put it out of your mind for the time being. It&apos;s not relevant to the Pythagorean example anyway, and we can safely return to it later.</p><p>  &gt;And you deem it permissable in Classical-Romantic<br/>  &gt;theory<br/>  &gt;that Bbbb could be employed when a musician decided in the most<br/>  &gt;unlikely<br/>  &gt;event that it would be prudent to descend a fifth below Fbb?</p><p>  Yes, but in the repertoire, in Beethoven&apos;s Appassionata Sonata and all that followed, any descent into the double-flat key area would be abruptly halted (in the written music -- not halted audibly or on the part of the musician) with an enharmonic shift, so any key containing a double-flat (and that includes D-flat minor), as it&apos;s established in the music, is immediately re-interpreted in the notation as a key containing no flats at all (in this case, C-sharp minor). But to the composer, there is no shift at all; for example, if the modulations are followed faithfully, the Appassionata Sonata would have to end in an extremely remote key, 24 fifths from the starting key, but in Beethoven&apos;s time sonatas ended in the same key they began in. In fact, the Sonata is typically referred to as Piano Sonata No. 23 in F Minor, op. 57, which implies that the piece begins and ends in the key signature of four flats. Perhaps you can obtain a score of this piece?</p><p>  Beethoven not only found it prudent but indeed his heart longed to descend a fifth below Fbb. Then, in the Appassionata, he descends another 14 fifths below that! How thankful he must have been that his piano was tuned in a true well-temperament, all 12 fifths suitable for harmony and every pitch suitable to substitute for the pitch 12 (or 24, 36, etc.) fifths away.</p><p>  &gt;Would<br/>  &gt;this not be a breach of the number 35 as encompassing all the double<br/>  &gt;sharps<br/>  &gt;and double flats?</p><p>  There is no barrier at all.</p><p>  Double-sharps and double-flats are already a little bit redundant in the key system since Bach. They serve only to preserve the diatonic intervals&apos; staff positions when one is writing in a remote key (one with many sharps or flats in the key signature). When the &apos;wandering&apos; becomes too remote, the enharmonics are quickly &apos;canceled&apos; by establishing (in the notation, no one hears this) a new key signature, enharmonically equivalent to the &quot;intended&quot; one. This is also convenient for the reader; translating double-sharps and double-flats to their more familiar equivalents on one&apos;s instrument is a time-consuming process.</p><p>  Therefore, explicit writing of triple-flats has never been necessary, and has been avoided. Beethoven probably would have written them if he thought in a tuning system where they sounded different from ordinary notes.</p><p>  &gt;I was entertaining the idea that Western tonal music<br/>  &gt;does<br/>  &gt;not allow for triple sharps and triple flats.</p><p>  It allows for them but, simply, avoids them by making use of enharmonic shifts.</p><p>  &gt;This is where, I imagined, the Classical-Romantic practice from the<br/>  &gt;time of<br/>  &gt;Beethoven to Debussy (and beyond) arises.</p><p>  In fact, it is this very enharmonic shifting I describe -- moving so far in either the sharp or flat direction that a notational adjustment must be written (though there&apos;s no adjustment in sound) -- that distinguishes this Beethoven-to-Debussy practice from the Corelli-through-Mozart practice. For the first time, the assumption of an open chain of fifths was abandoned, and music was understood in terms of a closed circle of 12 fifths. The circle of 12 fifths, not any set of 35 notational symbols, is truly what characterizes the Western key system (and pitch notation) since Beethoven.</p><p>  &gt;Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but<br/>  &gt;the<br/>  &gt;philarmonic orchestras that perform the symphonies of the great masters<br/>  &gt;are<br/>  &gt;not very much known to execute meantone Baroque-Classical temperaments.<br/>  &gt;I<br/>  &gt;had the feeling that the diatonic and chromatic usage of the semitone<br/>  &gt;is<br/>  &gt;much akin to the enharmonical sets I presented in my paper.</p><p>  In some major orchestras (but as Werner Mohrlok will attest, not in others) there is a tendency to push minor seconds and other leading tone intervals, and even (shockingly for harmony) major thirds, toward their Pythagorean dispositions, in reference to a particular key. But this is a very different thing from adopting Pythagorean tuning wholesale. If that were done, enharmonic shifts would sound very abrupt and disorienting. And enharmonic differences among transposing instruments in an orchestra would create a giant accordion-like sound. I think examination of such passages in your favorite Beethoven-to-Debussy recordings, with the score (preferably the same edition actually used by the conductor/director) in hand, will show that such effects do not arise.</p><p>  Other ensembles, including historically conscentious performers of Mozart, Telemann, and Renaissance music, do show meantone tendencies.</p><p>  Many ensembles, even when performing Beethoven-to-Debussy repertoire, will narrow the major thirds in long, sustained major triads and major seventh chords -- and this is opposite to the Pythagorean tendency. Werner has apparently witnessed this tendency even more than I have -- I&apos;ve definitely noticed it in brass and wind ensembles -- so I&apos;ll let him (I think he&apos;s currently active on the tuning list) fill you in on which particular ensembles he&apos;s listening to.</p><p>  -Paul</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  Do you Yahoo!?<br/>  Dress up your holiday email, Hollywood style.

Thank you very much for pointing out my error dear Werner.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   Apparently recent messages of mine have not been getting through. I<br/>  &gt;   had posted that I didn&apos;t think your scale was so feeble, and was<br/>  &gt;   thinking of trying it. It isn&apos;t a well-temperament, since it has a<br/>  &gt;   grave fifth, which is a full comma flat, and that comes with one of<br/>  &gt;   the pure major thirds, which seems a bit of a waste.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;   You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>  &gt;   of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>  &gt;     <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>  &gt;     <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>  &gt;     <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>  &gt;     <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>  &gt;     <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>  &gt;     <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt;         Yahoo!
