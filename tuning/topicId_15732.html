The point I found most interesting was that<br/>75/64 is much closer in frequency to 7/6 than to 19/16 - both<br/>of which I tried first - but it sounds far more different (to my<br/>ears) from the former than from the latter.  I never did figure<br/>out how to explain that.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div>
