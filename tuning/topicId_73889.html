I&apos;m not a teacher and really don&apos;t know<br/>&gt; where to start in writing one.</p><p>Well, a basic demonstration takes less than 30 minutes with a<br/>harpsichord.  Do this all directly in sound, and don&apos;t throw any<br/>mathematical concepts at them until they have the sound firmly in their<br/>ears.</p><p>Start from middle C.  Tune a pure 4th 4:3 to the F above it, and a pure<br/>5th 3:2 to the G.  From the G tune a pure 4th to D and then from that D<br/>a pure 5th up to A.  From the A tune a pure 4th down to E and from E a<br/>pure 5th up to B.  Copy a C to C octave.  Now you have the entire C<br/>major scale, Pythagorean.  Demonstrate that briefly.</p><p>Play some C, F, and G major triads, and the D minor and E minor triads.</p><p>Then, retune the E down so it&apos;s now a pure 5:4 from C, and remark (and<br/>demonstrate) how much flatter this is than the other E we just had.<br/>Demonstrate that the E-A is now rotten.  Bring the A down so it&apos;s now<br/>pure with both E and F...but now D-A is rotten.  Bring the B down so<br/>it&apos;s pure from both E and G.  Now you have a just-intonation layout,<br/>and since a break has to be present somewhere we&apos;ve put it at D-A.</p><p>Replay the C, F, and G major triads, and the D minor and E minor<br/>triads.  Make some remarks about the differences.</p><p>(Even better, if you have a second set of strings available: leave the<br/>first set in Pythagorean, and switch only the E/A/B of the second set<br/>with these shifts of a comma downward.  Then you can do quick and<br/>direct comparisons, not only with the triads but also with comma-<br/>shifted unisons.)</p><p>Then, demonstrate the two sizes of whole steps that are sitting there:<br/>C-D is a 9:8, and D-E is a 10:9.  Ask them if they can hear this<br/>difference in size, melodically.  Also demonstrate the F-B pure tritone.</p><p>As for sticking sharps and/or flats into the thing, it&apos;s merely a<br/>matter of choosing what they&apos;re going to be pure to, and if that&apos;s done<br/>by major 3rds, or by 4ths/5ths.  Several possibilities present<br/>themselves.  All lead to various wolves....</p><p>If it&apos;s been going well so far, ask the students how they could get<br/>around the D-A-E problem.  Some bright student might suggest moving the<br/>A a little bit, so it&apos;s only less bad from both of them.  Play that,<br/>with those two 1/2 comma intervals.  Remark that we&apos;ve just set up all<br/>the naturals of Kirnberger&apos;s temperament....</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Charles Lucy &#x3C;lucy@harmonics.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2007 1:33:27 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Robin;</p><p>Please make sure that you demonstrate beating, as you explain the integer frequency ratio theories;</p><p>and remember to point out the problems and limitations of JI as the basis of a practical musical tuning system.</p><p>Integer frequency ratios are the &quot;intervals&quot; that generate beating, yet not necessarily where the &quot;musical harmonics&quot; are to be found.</p><p>Try thinking beyond (2D) sinewaves;-)</p><p>Charles Lucy <a href="mailto:lucy@lucytune.com">lucy@lucytune.com</a></p><p>-----  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -----</p><p>For information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>LucyTuned Lullabies (from around the world):<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p><p>Skype user = lucytune</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/lucytuning">http://www.myspace.com/lucytuning</a></p><p>On 15 Oct 2007, at 20:06, Robin Perry wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi All,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m trying to find a lesson plan for teaching 7th &amp; 8th graders the<br/>&gt; basics of just intonation.

I&apos;m not a teacher and really don&apos;t know<br/>&gt; &gt; where to start in writing one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, a basic demonstration takes less than 30 minutes with a<br/>&gt; harpsichord.</p><p>Personally, I wouldn&apos;t use a harpsi, too hard to hear unless you are<br/>used to that sound. I&apos;d use a synthesizer with some fairly bright,<br/>stable sound, something in the direction of Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>recommendation: a good, stable regal. A basic sawtooth will do,<br/>thought a slightly filtered one softening the highs is better. I use a<br/>wave extracted from me singing a low Bb with a bright &quot;a&quot; as in hay or<br/>bay, which is the favorite vowel sound of Corsican singers for their<br/>nonsense syllables tuned utterly breatakingly rock solid pure. I<br/>sampled myself, gave it a nice attack and short decay, and it sounds<br/>every bit the regal.</p><p>The advantage of a synthesizer is that you can move fast among<br/>different sounds, comparing things like our &quot;normal&quot; fifths and thirds<br/>with pure versions. Also, you can bump up or down the relative<br/>strengths of the harmonics, making the beats more or less obvious.<br/>Finally, you can sustain intervals and chords indefinitely until<br/>everybody cops to the beating. The problem with larger classes is that<br/>many students will simple be sitting in a position where there are<br/>nodes or reflective cancellations of one or the other of the critical<br/>frequencies making it almost impossible to hear beats. For those who<br/>can&apos;t hear, have them move around in the room or even just turn their<br/>heads slowly. Seek a position yourself where the beats are readily<br/>heard, and have the students stand there.</p><p>&gt; Do this all directly in sound, and don&apos;t throw any<br/>&gt; mathematical concepts at them until they have the sound firmly in their<br/>&gt; ears.</p><p>Agree completely, though it won&apos;t hurt to tell them about the<br/>harmonics of a single tone and how it is coincident harmonics between<br/>tones which define pure intervals. This of course leads straight to<br/>ratios, which also can&apos;t hurt if you demonstrate that those numbers<br/>actually mean something you can hear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Start from middle C.  Tune a pure 4th 4:3 to the F above it, and a pure<br/>&gt; 5th 3:2 to the G.  From the G tune a pure 4th to D and then from that D<br/>&gt; a pure 5th up to A.  From the A tune a pure 4th down to E and from E a<br/>&gt; pure 5th up to B.  Copy a C to C octave.  Now you have the entire C<br/>&gt; major scale, Pythagorean.  Demonstrate that briefly.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t. It&apos;s an unnatural construct foisted on western music by a<br/>radical sectarian leader who refused to open his ears and mind enough<br/>to admit a pure third. Luckily, he was ignored by a vast majority of<br/>musicians world-wide, mostly because they didn&apos;t know about him. I<br/>always use Corsicans, Mongolians, Indian Classics, etc, as the<br/>starting point. Uncorrupted minds and ears. Lots of easy to find audio<br/>examples to blast open the ears of those who suffer from Acquired<br/>Intonation Deficiency Syndrome from having heard nothing but ET their<br/>whole life. Even lots of Country Western uses pure thirds with the<br/>almost pure fifths of ET. Check out the &quot;Old Timey&quot; stuff, lots of<br/>good raw purity to be had there.</p><p>I&apos;d start with a pure major triad, showing how it contains a pure<br/>fifth and both types of pure third. Then make two more of &apos;em on the<br/>dominant and subdominant, the second and third most important chords<br/>in trad harmony. You not only have a diatonic scale in one possible<br/>Just tuning (there are others), but you also have the three triads<br/>which make up the sum total harmonic content of about 90% of pop<br/>music. Now show where the booby trap is (supertonic minor triad).</p><p>Personally, I think that about wraps it up. No need to get into<br/>Pythagorean and all that rot unless you want to start talking about<br/>the commas, which is more advanced than needs be for an intro for kids<br/>that young. My experience is that that more informatin you throw at<br/>them, the more their eyes cross, and they forget to listen. They just<br/>(bad pun) need to know that (a) there is a natural way to tune triads<br/>dictated by the physics of sound, (b) it is very easy to hear it, but<br/>(c) we don&apos;t do it &apos;cause it creates some conflicts, especially when<br/>we think that each note can have only one fixed identity, which is<br/>pretty damn primitive but hey that&apos;s where we&apos;re at at the moment. We<br/>were much smarter until about 1800 or so...</p><p>&gt; Remark that we&apos;ve just set up all<br/>&gt; the naturals of Kirnberger&apos;s temperament....</p><p>Which 7th and 8th grader is gonna know who the f___Kirnberger was, or<br/>even care? I never mention him, not even in the advanced class for 2nd<br/>year conservatory students (general acoustics). It&apos;s enough getting<br/>them to wrap their heads around meantones, mod meantones, and<br/>circulating temps in one session, which is all we have time for.<br/>Kirnberger is a complete waste of time. For the kids in the tuning<br/>class, I do mention him, but only after they have enough real<br/>temperaments under their belts to realize what a load of bunk K&apos;berger<br/>was/is. After they&apos;ve been setting Rameau Mod Mean, Werckmeister<br/>Continuo, and a couple of Neidhardt&apos;s, they laugh at K&apos;berger&apos;s<br/>plethora of Pythagorean thirds and his clumsy two-bit division of the<br/>S. comma. Kunst des Reinen Satzes my a__! What a load of Dingo&apos;s<br/>Kidneys!!! But that&apos;s for the really advanced kids. For junior high<br/>kids, keep it simple!</p><p>There&apos;s also some good Sacred Harp stuff to be found with pure triads,<br/>but you have to search. Most of the stuff you can download is down by<br/>modern social club choirs who don&apos;t know how to git down n raw when<br/>raisin&apos; yur voice in prayz untah the Lawd Awlmahtah (Hallelooyah<br/>Bruther!)

The suggestions so far have been biased towards 5-limit traditional harmony.  Perhaps you&apos;d rather open their ears to modern microtonal music.  It&apos;s really up to you.</p><p>Another question is whether you should focus on the mathematics.  So far people have said &quot;no&quot;.  But tuning theory can be an interesting way of teaching an application of arithmetic with fractions.  At that age they should know how to do it, and it&apos;ll be fresh in their minds, but I doubt they&apos;ll know it so well that it&apos;ll be trivial.  So maybe that could be the focus of the lesson.  If not, and especially for a short lesson, it&apos;s something you should avoid completely.</p><p>It&apos;s good for them to have something to listen to.  That&apos;s why you have to know what the resources are.  If it&apos;s a long lesson you could try getting some students to sing in JI. There are bound to be a few students in a choir of some kind so they&apos;ll have some experience of singing.  As well as being fun and interesting, this will give them a chance to relax as their attention wanders mid-lesson.</p><p>Don&apos;t expect a ready-made lesson plan anyway.  It&apos;ll never fit your exact circumstances.  And play to your strengths! If you&apos;re a guest to the school (as seems likely) they&apos;ll be interested in what *you* do with it.

Neither a harpsichord (due to gauge differences and built-in string-length differences) nor a synthesizer is going to have the immediate visual element of a monochord -- in which frequency ratios also correspond to string length ratios.  Ideally, each student should have her own instrument, and one that she has built herself, but this is a matter of time and resources.  (Lloyd Rodgers, Professor of Music at CSU Fullerton, now starts his theory classes with a trip to the hardware store to get materials for building monochords!).</p><p>For the classroom purposes, the monochord need be nothing other than a strip of wood, ca 120x10 cm long. (Resting on a table or desk top, it can &quot;borrow&quot; the resonance of the furniture for amplification).  You need two tuning pins (get from a local piano tuner along with a tuning hammer) turned into holes drilled in one end and two small nails on the other end to anchor the wires.  Two small pieces of moulding with a sharp edge can serve as bridges and should be set one meter apart.  A meter measuring tape (Ikea gives them out for free) can be mounted for easy measurement of string lengths. Finally, Bill Colvig had a very practical idea for an accurate moveable bridge -- a pair of tweezers, mounted on a block of wood so that the string can be stopped without pushing it downward and adding to the tension.</p><p>A typical lesson plan would include:</p><p>(1) tuning the strings to a unison</p><p>First consider simple ratios between an open string and a second, stopped string:</p><p>(2) locating the harmonic nodes of the strings and noting the proportions and musical intervals.</p><p>(3) locating the arithmetic divisions of the string and noting the proportions and musical intervals.</p><p>(4) When the strings are tuned low enough, simple ratios of the string vibrations should be visually observable, perhaps when translated into shadows projected on a wall.</p><p>(5) Ask the students:  What is relationship between string length ratios and frequency ratios?</p><p>Then move on to compound intervals:</p><p>(6)  Locate the octave of an octave and the octave of a fifth.   What operations on string lengths and frequency ratios are being carried out?</p><p>(7)  Locate the fifth of a fifth, and then the tone one octave lower.  Again, describe this operation in terms of string lengths and ratios.</p><p>(8)  Use this process to determine the notes of a familiar scale, marking the tones on the paper strip.</p><p>(9) Use the scale to play some simple tunes, perhaps with a pen or a glass as a slide.</p><p>******</p><p>For seventh or eighth graders, I would not even mention the word temperament.  There is already a very rich set of information above, touching on maths (operations on fractions) and physics as well as music, capable of extension in each of the subject areas, and the issues involved in temperament really require a substantially larger bit of music theory and are, in practice, both contentious and culturally specific.</p><p>Daniel Wolf<br/>Frnakfurt</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2007 2:04:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Robin,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robin Perry&quot; &lt;jinto83@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow!

I&apos;ve had many students who<br/>tell me a couple of years down the road that their<br/>teacher in school just taught something which they<br/>already learned from me.</p><p>My approach is to ask the kids as many questions as<br/>i can and make them think up the answers.</p><p>The beginning is to have them understand that sound<br/>is produced by vibrations. Most kids this age know<br/>that we have eardrums in our ears, and they know<br/>how drums work, so it&apos;s easy enough to explain that<br/>the source of the vibration causes the air to vibrate<br/>in a wave pattern, which in turn causes the eardrums<br/>to vibrate to the same pattern. I don&apos;t get into the<br/>physiology beyond that, i simply say that the nerves<br/>send that signal to the brain and the brain figures<br/>out everything from that point.</p><p>With a piano, it&apos;s fairly easy to start out by having<br/>them look at the keyboard, observe the repeating<br/>patterns of the black keys, and then ask them why<br/>the patterns repeat. After playing enough notes an<br/>octave apart, the kids will come around to making the<br/>link between the identical appearance and the<br/>nearly-identical sound. It usually takes awhile,<br/>because the kids aren&apos;t thinking about pitch-classes<br/>right off the bat like we trained musicians, and it&apos;s<br/>obvious to them that notes an octave apart are two<br/>different notes, because one is quite a bit higher<br/>than the other. But by making them listen to it enough<br/>times, and compare the octave to the other intervals,<br/>they eventually get it.</p><p>Then i explain frequency and wavelength, and the 2/1<br/>ratio, and that the reason why those notes sound so<br/>similar is because those are the two smallest numbers<br/>that can be compared, so they&apos;re the closest relationship.</p><p>Then continue similarly for 3/2, 4/3, 5/4, etc.</p><p>Once i get them used to how the ratios relate to what<br/>they hear, then i play a low note on the piano and<br/>have them listen very carefully until they can hear<br/>the overtones, usually helping out by also playing the<br/>higher notes which come close to overtones while<br/>holding down the low note. This leads to an explanation<br/>of the harmonic series.</p><p>I&apos;m always careful to explain that the overtones are<br/>slightly different in pitch from what the piano keys<br/>are tuned to. This becomes very easy if the piano has<br/>a note which produces a clear 7th or 11th harmonic,<br/>because the difference between the harmonic and the<br/>piano key is readily heard.</p><p>From there, it&apos;s a fairly simple matter to explain<br/>how a whole tuning system can be built out of notes<br/>like that, hence, JI.</p><p>For some students, i&apos;ve even been able to go thru the<br/>whole process of building a 12-tone scale out of 4ths<br/>and 5ths, and then explaining how the piano closes the<br/>cycle, but how the slight difference in the JI pitches<br/>results in the pythagorean-comma. This requires an<br/>explanation of cents, which is fairly easy to grasp.</p><p>First i tell them that the pythagorean-comma is<br/>about 1/4 of a semitone (i.e., 25 cents) because that&apos;s<br/>something that they can relate to the piano a little<br/>easier. Then i get a little more accurate and explain<br/>that it&apos;s closer to 24 cents.</p><p>They usually get pretty confused intially by the<br/>explanation of the comma, but when i explain the<br/>process of tempering each 4th or 5th by 2 cents,<br/>they can see that by the time the 13th note in the<br/>cycle is reached, the previous 12 notes have eliminated<br/>that 24 cents, so the 13th note is the same as the first.</p><p>If they&apos;re interested in it beyond that point, it&apos;s<br/>time to get Tonescape downloaded and running on their<br/>computer! ;-)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2007 6:10:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I thought one of the points of JI was to go beyond 12 pitches in the<br/>octave. That is its natural habitat. So it doesn&apos;t make all that much<br/>sense to use a 12-note-per-octave keyboard instrument as your main<br/>resource - unless you are willing to use strongly nonstandard tunings,<br/>for example setting the D key to 10/9 and the Eb to 9/8. Then you have<br/> the ingredients for &apos;My country tis of thee&apos; or &apos;God save the Queen&apos;<br/>in JI.</p><p>Practically, if one has a good, loud harpsichord with a sustained,<br/>harmonic-rich tone, it could work. Expecting 30 children to cluster<br/>round anything is a bit impractical though. With a mediocre or<br/>short-toned harpsichord, which alas is rather more likely, it is not<br/>worth even starting.</p><p>Basically keyboard music and keyboard tunings are a misleading<br/>distraction from the subject. (Perhaps that&apos;s a reason why there is no<br/>standard JI lesson plan for the standard piano-bashing music teacher!)<br/>The best one could do in this direction would be an old harmonium or<br/>reed-organ (19th century descendent of the regal) where you can adjust<br/>the reeds in real time.</p><p>But really: it *strongly* depends on what resources you have at hand.</p><p>In the absence of resources, building three- or four-string monochords<br/>is a good start - assuming that you can get them to function.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p></div><h3>Brad Lehman &#x3C;bpl@umich.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2007 8:36:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In addition to the harpsichord presentations I&apos;ve already mentioned,<br/>I did a JI demonstration once in a public lecture using a $20 &quot;Lap<br/>Harp&quot; from Wal-Mart.  The thing is a trapezoid with two octaves of<br/>strings, having the diatonic scale only.  It&apos;s played with either a<br/>guitar pick (included) or fingers.  I set it up with a just scale,<br/>and it was nice not only to strum the entire scale at once for its<br/>ringing effect, but also to play major/minor triads and some 7th<br/>chords.  The major-major 7th chord of C-E-G-B sounds spectacular, and<br/>with the D 9th added as well...even on a lousy little $20 instrument.</p><p>C 0, D 0, E -1, F 0, G 0, A -1, B -1.</p><p>One could buy two of these and have them tuned differently from one<br/>another, for some comma-shifted unisons.  Or have the second<br/>instrument supply some sharps or flats against the first one.</p><p>Most of the time I leave this &quot;Lap Harp&quot; in regular 1/6 comma, which<br/>also makes it sound like a much more than $20 instrument.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Robin Perry &#x3C;jinto83@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/16/2007 12:42:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My sincerest thanks, once again, everyone!
