Other updates include:</p><p>2032 (a modal physical modeling synthesizer that supports microtonal tunings and matching of the timbre to the underlying tuning. Tunings, timbral matching, and physical models can be changed dynamically)<br/> - The size of the period can now be changed dynamically (in Setup or via Relayer or Hex)<br/> - Improved sound quality (sustained notes no longer overload)<br/> - Improved balance between low and high notes<br/> - Fixed bug in OS X version where MIDI and audio options did not work correctly<br/> - Addition of a hidden all-notes-off/panic/reset button at the top of the tower<br/> - Fixed rounding errors which made tuning sent by Hex or Relayer, and that displayed by 2032, different</p><p>Relayer (for players of the AXiS-49 and the QWERTY keyboard - Relayer provides access to a broad range of note layouts and microtonal tunings.
