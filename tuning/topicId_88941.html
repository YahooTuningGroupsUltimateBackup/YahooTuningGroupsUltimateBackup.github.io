I&apos;ve found 22/15 and 50/33 work much better than 16/11 and 17/11 and many other fractions in the area nearing 3/2 (Igs suggested both of those options to me, btw)...but other suggestions are of course welcome. :-)</p><p>Jacques&gt; Instead of 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 steps in 24-ET, Mohajira would<br/>&gt; be 4 + 5 + 4 +  5 + 4 + 5 + 4 steps (or other modes) in 31-ET,<br/>&gt; and instead of 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3  in 24-ET, Arabic Rast<br/>&gt; (closer to Ptolemy&apos;s Homalon) would be  5 +  4 + 4 +  5 + 5 + 4 + 4<br/>&gt; steps in 31-ET.</p><p>Gene&gt;&quot;Five of these showed up in my survey of proper 7 note scales in 31et.
