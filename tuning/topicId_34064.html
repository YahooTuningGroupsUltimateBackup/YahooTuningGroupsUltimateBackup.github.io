What I learned from actual music, however, was that<br/>changes in tonality--modulation, if you please--is created by modifying the<br/>tritone. Since there is only one per major key, it is the most compelling<br/>factor in leading the ear toward another tonality.

The diminished fifth<br/>sucks like a vacuum toward a major or minor third resolution and an<br/>augmented fourth pushes like an explosion toward a major or minor sixth.<br/>Call it &quot;style&quot; it you like.

If only<br/>choral groups and orchestras were fully aware of the power of the flexible<br/>tritone in &quot;flinging&quot; tonality into myriad tonal directions simply by<br/>modifying its tuning.
