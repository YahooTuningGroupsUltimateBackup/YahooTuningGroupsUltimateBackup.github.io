But glad you&apos;re so active. And I<br/>can&apos;t wait to hear that JI Mahler Seventh.</p><p>So 6L3s would be a 15-tone scale ((6 x 2) + 3)? I know Liszt had an<br/>interest in microtones, which may be where Busoni first got the idea. And<br/>there is a 9-tone scale called the Tcherepnin scale, after the composer, in<br/>12-tET, but it&apos;s 3L6s (see how quick I pick things up?):</p><p>C C# D E F F# G# A Bb</p><p>which is conceptually similar to the octotonic scale that Liszt was among<br/>the first to use. Is it possible Dan switched the numbers around and it&apos;s<br/>3L6s instead of 6L3s? Alexander Tcherepnin used that scale a lot, but it&apos;s<br/>obviously in 12-tET. Whatever microtones Liszt was interested in wouldn&apos;t<br/>have included, I don&apos;t think, a number of tones per octave not divisible by<br/>12. The theoretical treatise Liszt worked on in the last years of his life<br/>disappeared, and to make things worse, his &quot;friends&quot; were afraid the world<br/>would think Liszt had gone mad if they knew what weird projects he was<br/>working on, which is why some of his strangest compositions didn&apos;t get<br/>published until the 1950s. But next time I&apos;m at my office I&apos;ll look through<br/>my Liszt stuff and confirm what scales he was known to be thinking about.</p><p>I downloaded Dan&apos;s mp3 *At a Day Job*, which is a blast (I&apos;m a pushover for<br/>a 13/10 interval - tried to base a piece on the sucker myself and couldn&apos;t<br/>finish it, but I wanted to hear Dan&apos;s). I intend to download a lot more,<br/>but it&apos;s slow, my screen freezes, my modem cuts off, etc. Easier to run to<br/>the record store.</p><p>All the best,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=12872 href="#12872">ðŸ”—</a>kgann@earthlink.net</h3><span>9/16/2000 8:50:15 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bingo!</p><p>Well, great minds run in the same gutter, &apos;cause everyone had worked it out<br/>before I could even get back. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if Liszt had a late<br/>piano piece or two in that scale, and I&apos;ll check around. But Tcherepnin&apos;s<br/>music is loaded with it. Leon Botstein conducted Tcherepnin&apos;s Rhapsodie<br/>Georgienne here last year, an early work based on Georgian folk tunes, and<br/>it was loaded with Tcherepnin scale, every page. Easy to find, because<br/>there&apos;s always one augmented triad missing from it. If Tcherepnin&apos;s<br/>interest was piqued by Georgian folk music, there may be some folk use of<br/>it that Liszt got hold of, as omniverously as he studied every folk music<br/>he could find out about.</p><p>And thanks for the welcome.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=12873 href="#12873">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2000 12:29:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kyle Gann wrote,</p><p>&gt; So 6L3s would be a 15-tone scale ((6 x 2) + 3)?</p><p>Right, but unfortunately that was just typo on my part -- sorry, it<br/>should have read 3L6s (ds = dan stearns, sd = sleepy dan).

His *Sketches for a Harmony of the Future*, however - the<br/>manuscript that was seen by friends but never surfaced after Liszt&apos;s<br/>death - seems to have had less to do with scales and more to do with<br/>building chords from intervals other than thirds, especially fourths<br/>and tritones. And I can&apos;t find a passage of much length in the scale.</p><p>To make a correction, Ferruccio Busoni was only 10 years old when he<br/>met Liszt. I suspect Liszt probably didn&apos;t discuss quarter-tones with<br/>the young lad. It was Debussy, not Busoni, who spent more private<br/>time<br/>with Liszt in the last years of his life, and to whom Liszt confided<br/>some of his theoretical concerns.</p><p>Kyle Gann</p></div><h3><a id=12875 href="#12875">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2000 11:20:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12870">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12870</a></p><p>&gt; Joseph Pehrson wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Huh??
