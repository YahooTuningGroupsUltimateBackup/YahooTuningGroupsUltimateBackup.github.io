Which can<br/>&gt; best be put as a question: Is the microtonal music we make &quot;tuning<br/>&gt; theory&quot; (or the realization thereof), or is it &quot;music&quot;. Ultimately,<br/>&gt; and most importantly, I believe it&apos;s the latter that must always take<br/>&gt; precedence. Microtonal tuning theory does not good music make. And<br/>&gt; one must face a huge &quot;alienation factor&quot; with the consumer of this<br/>&gt; kind of niche market, when the focus is on the theory.</p><p>&gt; What do you put forth with microtonal music that draws in the<br/>&gt; uninitiated? It&apos;s an important question to ask in the face of many<br/>&gt; cultural facts, such as: symphonies disbanding for lack of support,<br/>&gt; high school music programs being discontinued, classical music<br/>&gt; concert and CD sales at an all time low, and the ever deeper<br/>&gt; entrenchment of the big conglomo &quot;content controlling&quot; major record<br/>&gt; labels, who have such a power grip on the airwaves; distributing<br/>&gt; their own brand of &quot;audio valium&quot; - this is happening all over the<br/>&gt; country. What do microtonal composers have to contribute in these<br/>&gt; changing times? Part of the answer for me is beautiful music.</p><p>&gt; Can I get an Amen-a-?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Absolutely, amen-a Jacky.</p><p>I think about this issue alot, and its&apos; ramifications on my approach to<br/>making music. I play many things in public without ever mentioning that they<br/>are in JI, and many people appear to enjoy and be moved by the music. Much<br/>of my living is made playing traditional folk music of one sort or another,<br/>Appalachian, Celtic, blues, klezmer, eastern-European, etc. In much of this<br/>music, the traditional players, mostly unschooled in our current<br/>terminology, played in various folk intonations, many of which, when<br/>analyzed from the &apos;math&apos; perspective, turn out to be JI.</p><p>I have spent much effort, mostly by ear, to learn to play this music with<br/>its&apos; proper intonation, I have also spent considerable effort in learning to<br/>understand and utilize JI from the math perspective. Folk music sounds<br/>whitewashed to me to play it straight ET. And yet, I often encounter people<br/>with classical background stating that the old music on 78s is &apos;out of tune&apos;<br/>and they prefer this music when listening to people who are playing it<br/>&apos;clean&apos;.</p><p>Perhaps most fascinating to me is the many cases in which one or more<br/>instruments are playing ET and others are juxtaposing JI against it, say a<br/>voice or fiddle playing in JI with a guitar or piano accompaniment in 12ET.<br/>See Cape Breton fiddle music or blues for great examples of this phenomenum.<br/>One can onder what it would be like to hear this music completely JI, but tt<br/>doesn&apos;t lessen the music for me to hear this juxtaposition, if anything, it<br/>adds considerable intensity to the music.</p><p>I remember having an interesting thought when first encountering and<br/>studying JI on a more intellectual level that has always stuck with me. The<br/>question was whether I could get so into composing in JI that all music in<br/>12 ET, including my own body of work as well, would cease to hold any<br/>meaning for me? I have no answer for this, it is always evolving. Suffice it<br/>to say, that for me, the quality/beauty/emotion of the music always takes<br/>precedence. This holds true whether the music is simple folk or highly<br/>mathematical avant-garde. It works or it doesn&apos;t, and for the most part, I<br/>consider that to be highly subjective. Things that I didn&apos;t get on first<br/>listen, I now love; things that I use to listen to as the &apos;ultimate&apos; no<br/>longer do anything for me.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen<br/>please visit me on the web at <a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>Download a song (mp3) at <a href="http://www.mp3.com/sethausten">www.mp3.com/sethausten</a></p></div>
