See persian-far.scl in the Scala<br/>archives. The most common division of a whole tone at a rounded<br/>205 cents (equivalent to 9:8), e.g. C-D, is 90-45-70:</p><p>        C       Db      Dp      D<br/>        0       90     135     205<br/>            90      45      70</p><p>This 90-45-70 division applies in Farhat to each diatonic<br/>whole-tone of his 17-note octave (C-C) except F-G, where a<br/>division of 65-65-70, quite close to 17-ET, applies:</p><p>        F      F&gt;     Gp     G<br/>       500    565    630    700<br/>           65     65     70</p><p>Thus we have:</p><p>      205           205       90      200<br/> |------------|-------------|----|-------------|<br/> C   Db  Dp   D   Eb   Ep   E    F   F&gt;   Gp   G<br/> 0   90  135 205  295 340  410  500 565  630  700<br/>  90   45  70   90  45   70   90   65  65   70</p><p>      205           205       90<br/> |------------|-------------|----|<br/> G    Ab Ap   A   Bb   Bp   B    C 700  790 835 905  995 1040 1110 1200<br/>  90   45  70   90   45   70   90</p><p>In Farhat&apos;s tuning, a 90-cent limma step always receives a<br/>diatonic semitone spelling (e.g. C-Db), while a smaller step is<br/>always spelled as a koron or sori interval. According to Farhat<br/>and Tala&grave;i, a koron or sori interval is _not_ used as a direct<br/>melodic step except in the context of certain ornaments sometimes<br/>described as &quot;microtones.&quot;</p><p>Jean During reports the results of one survey of tunings used by<br/>some noted Iranian performers (voice, ney, tar, or setar)<br/>suggesting that semitone steps of around 70-75 cents, comparable<br/>to a larger koron or sori interval of Farhat or Tala&grave;i, are not<br/>so uncommon in practice. Another remark of Farhat, who notes that<br/>&quot;chromatic&quot; progressions like Eb-E are not used, suggests that<br/>the theoretical exclusion of even large koron or sori steps from<br/>the usual patterns of melody may reflect the unexpected placement<br/>of these steps as well as their absolute size, since Eb-E would<br/>be a 135-cent neutral second much like the routine D-Ep in Shur,<br/>for example.</p><p>Whatever lines may or may not be drawn in modern performances of<br/>classical Persian music, however, many 17-note systems present a<br/>situation where regular semitone or limma steps are often<br/>identical or interchangeable with those used for a koron or sori<br/>inflection. Before delving into the use of koron/sori notation<br/>for such systems, we may find it helpful briefly to consider the<br/>kind of classical modern tar intonation, as it might be<br/>described, suggested by Farhat&apos;s recommended tuning and his<br/>musical examples for some of the dastgah-ha.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------<br/>1, Some examples of koron and sori in Persian theory<br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>First, let us consider his Dastgah-e Shur, with the final on D:</p><p>                                         Ap<br/>                                         630<br/>                                       135|70<br/>  A    Bp    C     D    Ep    F      G      A    Bb     C     D<br/>-500 -365  -205    0    135  295    495    700  790   995   1200<br/>   135   160   205   135   160   200    205   90   205   205</p><p>Often a koron lowers a step by about 70 cents, or a third of a<br/>tone. Shur, as interpreted by Farhat, illustrates a pattern that<br/>I generally seek to follow: when a minor third in Persian music<br/>is divided into two Zalzalian or neutral second steps, the<br/>smaller step often precedes the larger, here in a division of<br/>around 135-160 cents (e.g. A-Bp-C below the final; D-Ep-F).</p><p>Not all Persian theorists or performers observe this preference:<br/>thus Tala&grave;i recommends a tetrachord up from the final of about<br/>140-140-220 cents, making no distinction between the two<br/>Zalzalian steps. Farhat&apos;s examples show how musicians who do<br/>recognize such a distinction may adjust a fretting scheme to<br/>obtain the desired order of smaller and larger Zalzalian steps at<br/>common locations for some of the dastgah-ha, for example D Shur.</p><p>A characteristic trait of Persian Shur as well as Arab Bayyati is<br/>a distinction between a minor sixth above the final in the<br/>&quot;standard&quot; form of the mode (Bb), but a neutral third below it<br/>(Bp). The extra note Ap is a motaqqayer or &quot;mutable note&quot; often<br/>used as a lowered form of the fifth degree A in descents toward<br/>the final, e.g. Bb-Ap-G...</p><p>Let&apos;s next consider the notation of the basic form of Dastgah-e<br/>Chahargah, rather like that of two conjuct Hijaz tetrachords in<br/>maqam music with the final as the common note where the<br/>tetrachords join, here C:</p><p>      |-------------------|------------------|<br/>      G      Ap       B   C     Dp      E    F<br/>    -500   -365     -90   0    135     410  500<br/>        135     275    90   135    275    90</p><p>Farhat describes the middle interval of a Chahargah tetrachord at<br/>about 275 cents as a &quot;plus-tone&quot; somewhat smaller than a regular<br/>minor third at around 290-295 cents. The spelling, Ap-B or Dp-E,<br/>fits with the idea of a tone plus a koron interval rather smaller<br/>than a limma: thus Ap-A-B or Dp-D-E, with the concept of a<br/>&quot;thirdtone&quot; often fitting nicely, although smaller koron or sori<br/>intervals on the order of 45-60 cents may also occur.</p><p>While koron/sori notation readily shows the location of Zalzalian<br/>or &quot;plus-tone&quot; steps (the latter, in Farhat, on the order of 7:6<br/>or 75:64), it is not always so transparent in suggesting finer<br/>distinctions between interval types. For example, Farhat explains<br/>that the tetrachord leading up to the final of Dastgah-e Bayat-e<br/>Esfahan has a small neutral second, tone, and large neutral<br/>second, suggesting something like 135-205-160 cents, which is<br/>indeed one attractive interpretation, known as the &quot;Old Esfahan.&quot;<br/>However, his actual notation is as follows:</p><p>       D     Ep     F&gt;     G</p><p>Glancing at the notation, we see that D-Ep and F&gt;-G are Zalzalian<br/>seconds as expected -- but must arrive at the sizes in the<br/>context of a given tuning scheme (for a fixed-pitch instrument),<br/>such as Farhat&apos;s:</p><p>       D     Ep     F&gt;     G<br/>       0    135    360    495<br/>         135    225    135</p><p>We have in fact a tetrachord of the Buzurg type, with two<br/>smallish neutral thirds plus a middle interval around 8:7, indeed<br/>quite close to the classic 14:13-8:7-13:12 at 128-231-139 cents!</p><p>If we placed the final on C rather than G, then Farhat&apos;s order of<br/>small neutral second, tone, and large neutral second would<br/>obtain:</p><p>       G     Ap     Bp     C<br/>       0    135    340    495<br/>         135    205    160</p><p>This form of Esfahan may be placed in the wider category of<br/>tetrachords in maqam or dastgah music with the middle interval of<br/>a tone not too far from 9:8, and a lower and upper neutral<br/>second: in medieval and modern Arab theory this genre is known as<br/>&grave;Iraq, while on this list it is often called Mohajira. As you<br/>have noted here, this type of genre using 9:8 should really be<br/>distinguished from Buzurg with a step of around 8:7.</p><p>As Farhat himself emphasizes, the notation is meant to be<br/>&quot;flexible,&quot; and thus can be congenial to a range of regular or<br/>irregular 17-note systems. Happily this congeniality extends to<br/>systems where limma and koron/sori steps are freely<br/>interchangeable.</p><p>---------------------------<br/>2. The simplest case: 17-ET<br/>---------------------------</p><p>In 17-ET, a step of 1/17 octave of 70.588 cents identically and<br/>uniformly defines either a regular limma (e.g. E-F) or a koron or<br/>sori inflection (e.g. F-F&gt;, Gp-G). Further, for example, this is<br/>no distinction between a regular minor third such as G-Bb and a<br/>&quot;plus-tone&quot; such as Ap-B in a setting such as Dastgah-e<br/>Chahargah. Both are equal to 4/3-tone, or about 282.35 cents.</p><p>Our 17-ET notation is thus straightforward, with equivalent<br/>notations shown for each accidental:</p><p>   C&gt;  Dp     D&gt;  Ep          F&gt;  Gp      G&gt;  Ap      A&gt;   Bp C  Db  C#  D  Eb  D#   E   F  Gb  F#   G  Ab  G#  A   Bb   A#   B    C 0  70 141 212 282 353 424 494 565 635 706 776 847 918 988 1059 1129 1200</p><p>Here the rule is that a flat or sharp lowers or raises by two<br/>tuning steps, or 141 cents, while a koron or sori lowers by one<br/>such step or 71 cents -- thus, as it happens, literally serving<br/>as a &quot;half-flat&quot; or &quot;half-sharp.&quot; The more general concept of a<br/>thirdtone inflection, also literally realized in 17-ET, is often,<br/>although not always, applicable as an approximate guide in other<br/>17-note systems.</p><p>An interesting feature of 17-ET is that the main tetrachord of<br/>Shur, e.g. D-Ep-F-G at 141-141-212 cents, is not too far from<br/>Tala&grave;i&apos;s recommended 140-140-220 cents.</p><p>                                       628<br/>                                        G#<br/>                                        Ap<br/>       A#                D#           132|77<br/>  A    Bp    C     D     Ep    F     G     A   Bb     C     D -494  -353 -212    0    141   282   494   706  776   988   1200<br/>    141  141   212   141   141   212   212   77   212   212</p><p>Note that while the guideline of Farhat and Tala&grave;i against using<br/>a kori or sori inflection as a usual melodic step (e.g. Ap-A)<br/>does not hold consistently in many 17-note systems and styles<br/>where the same physical interval may be used as a more or less<br/>ordinary semitone (e.g. G#-A) in other transpositions or modal<br/>contexts, their rule is still a very useful guide in the modal<br/>context where the koron or sori notation occurs. Thus D Shur&apos;s spelling tells us that Ap does _not_ normally move directly<br/>upward to A, a koron higher. Rather, this inflection often marks<br/>a descent toward the final; and it may also occur when the main<br/>tetrachord of Shur immediately above the final (D-Ep=F-G) is<br/>transposed upward by a fourth, so that we have G-Ap-Bb-C.</p><p>The central interval of a Chahargah tetrachord, 141-282-71 cents,<br/>is likewise not very far from Farhat&apos;s suggested size around 270<br/>cents, although it is also the regular minor third and so does<br/>not have special narrower size of his &quot;plus-tone.&quot; If we place<br/>the final of this dastgah on C, with conjunct tetrachords below<br/>and above, we have:</p><p>         G#               C#<br/>    G    Ap     B    C    Dp     E   F<br/>    0   141    424  494  635    918 988<br/>     141   282    71  141    282   71</p><p>A lower Esfahan tetrachord leading up to the final, 141-212-141<br/>cents, is like the Old Esfahan in using a regular middle second<br/>for the middle step; but somewhat different in not having any<br/>large neutral second, say on the order of 12:11 or 128:117. Here,<br/>following Farhat, the final is on G, the fourth step of D Shur:</p><p>         G#    A#<br/>    G    Ap    Bp   C<br/>    0   141   353  494<br/>     141   212   141</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>3. Two other tunings: regular and coherent<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>In 17-ET, the limma cannot be distinguished from a koron or sori<br/>inflection because there is only size, 71 cents, available for<br/>either use. However, the two types of steps may also be treated<br/>as fully or at least partially interchangeable in tuning systems<br/>where varying step sizes are available, as happens in circulating<br/>temperaments such as George Secor&apos;s 17-WT, as well as a range of<br/>regular or irregular temperaments where such circulation (at<br/>least in a conventional sense) is not a goal.</p><p>Here I will consider first a regular but unequal temperament, my<br/>scheme using a fifth of 704.607 cents; and then a coherent<br/>rational tuning, your soria12.scl which presents a subset of a<br/>forthcoming 17-note system.</p><p>In the 704.607-cent temperament, we can produce a 17-note MOS<br/>either simply by using a chain of 16 fifths; or by the &quot;Mohajira&quot;<br/>method of chaining together neutral thirds with alternating sizes<br/>of 341 and 363 cents.</p><p>Either method produces a 17-note set with two adjacent step<br/>sizes: a regular limma at 77 cents, and a diesis or small<br/>semitone at 55 cents.  Placing the 1/1 so as to match as closely<br/>as possible Farhat&apos;s C-C scheme, we find that a keyboard octave<br/>of E-E serves this purpose. Here I show Farhat&apos;s spellings (C-C),<br/>and their equivalents in terms of a pragmatic notation to show<br/>keyboard locations, where this 17-MOS is a subset of a 24-note<br/>system using two conventional 12-note manuals (Eb-G#) at a diesis<br/>of 55 cents apart. Note that an asterisk (*) shows a note on the<br/>upper keyboard raised by this 55-cent diesis.</p><p>                       209            209         77       209<br/>                  |--------------|--------------|-----|----------------|<br/>   Keyboard       E    F    F*   F#   G    G*   G#    A    Bb   Bb*    B<br/>   Persian C-C    C  Db/C&gt; Dp/C# D  Eb/D&gt; Ep/D#  E    F  Gb/F&gt; F#/Gp   G<br/>                  0   77   132  209  286  341   418  495  572   628   705<br/>                    77   55   77   77   55    77   77   77   55     77</p><p>                       209            209           77<br/>                  |--------------|---------------|-----|<br/>   Keyboard       B    C    C*   C#   D    D*  Eb*/D#  E<br/>   Persian C-C    G  Ab/G&gt; Ap/G# A  Bb/A&gt; Bp/A#  B     C<br/>                 705  782  837  913  991  1046  1123 1200<br/>                    77   55   77   77   55    77    77</p><p>As the Persian or C-C equivalent spellings show, each diatonic<br/>whole-tone in this C-C spelling scheme is divided into steps of<br/>77-55-77 cents. A flat or sharp lowers or raises a note by 132<br/>cents (e.g. Bb-B, C-C#), while a koron or sori lowers or raises<br/>it by one 17-note step of 55 or 77 cents -- in this keyboard<br/>arrangement, as it happens, generally 77 cents.</p><p>Here is a version of Shur Dastgah on Persian D, or keyboard F#:</p><p>                                       628<br/>                                        C*<br/>                                        Ap<br/>                                     132|77<br/>  C#    D*   E     F#    G*    A     B     C#   D     E     F#<br/>  A    Bp    C     D     Ep    F     G     A   Bb     C     D -495  -363 -209    0    132   286   495   705  782   991   1200<br/>    132  154   209   132   154   209   209   77   209   209</p><p>As with Farhat&apos;s tuning above, we have Bp below the final but Bb<br/>above it in a &quot;textbook&quot; citation of Shur, and the lowered form<br/>of Ap often used in descending toward the final.</p><p>As with his tuning, so here, there are two forms of Esfahan. Let<br/>us first consider placing the final on Persian G, or keyboard B,<br/>approached by an ascending tetrachord at D-G (keyboard F#-B):</p><p>           F#     G*       Bb     B<br/>           D      Ep       F&gt;     G<br/>           0      132     363    495<br/>             132      231     132</p><p>Our resulting Buzurg is quite close to a just 128-231-139 or<br/>Farhat&apos;s 135-225-135, with either modern version, however, losing<br/>the subtle distinction in Safi al-Din al-Urmawi and Qutb al-Din<br/>al-Shirazi between the initial 14:13 and upper 13:12 steps.</p><p>As with Farhat&apos;s tuning, if we place the final, for example, on<br/>Persian  C, then the &quot;Old Esfahan&quot; results:</p><p>           B      C*       Eb      E<br/>           G      Ap       Bp      C<br/>           0      132     341     495<br/>             132      209     154</p><p>The tetrachord here is 132-209-154 cents, not too far from the<br/>135-205-160 cents that would result in Farhat&apos;s tuning, or a just<br/>version at 1/1-13/12-39/32-4/3 or 96:104:117:118, with steps of<br/>13:12-9:8-128:117 (139-204-155 cents) suggested by Ibn Sina&apos;s<br/>use of these step sizes in Mustaqim or 1/1-9/8-39/32-4/3, In<br/>fact, as you have suggested, if Dastgah-e Segah is begun on the<br/>third below the modern final -- often C and Ep respectively --<br/>then Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim or something quite similar results, as<br/>is shown in segah2.scl in the Scala archives.</p><p>With Dastgah-e Chahargah, we face a dilemma using &quot;only&quot; 17 notes<br/>of a system I am accustomed to in a 24-note form. Either we must<br/>use Chahargah tetrachords with ordinary minor thirds at 286 cents<br/>rather than the desired middle step around 7:6 (here 264 cents);<br/>or we must resort to some various curious transpositions. The<br/>reason is that our 704.607-cent temperament produces a near-7:6<br/>third from a chain of 14 fifths up, so that our MOS-17 set has<br/>these thirds at only three locations -- by comparison to the ten<br/>locations available in a 24-note tuning. Following Farhat, we<br/>will place the final of Chahargah on Persian C (keyboard E), the<br/>step at a whole tone below the final of Shur, to demonstrate the<br/>readily available form using a regular minor third:</p><p>           B      C*       Eb*   E     F*     G#    A<br/>           G      Ap       B     C     Dp      E    F<br/>           0      132     418   495    627    914  991<br/>             132      286     77   132    286    77</p><p>To demonstrate a really idiomatic form of Chahargah with the<br/>near-7:6 step, we must choose more unlikely location by usual<br/>Persian modal standards. One curious choice places the final on<br/>Persian E or keyboard G#, a major second above the final of our<br/>Shur as shown above at Persian D or keyboard F#:</p><p>         Eb*/D#    F       G*    G#     Bb     C*   C#<br/>           B       C&gt;      D#    E      F&gt;     G#    A<br/>           0      154     418   495    627     914  991<br/>              154      264    77   154     264    77</p><p>As these two examples show, Persian notation flexibly indicates<br/>the general type of an interval such as a neutral second, often<br/>shown as either a tone less koron (G-Ap or C-Dp) or a limma plus<br/>sori (B-C&gt; or E-F&gt;), while leaving open the specific size, which<br/>happens to be 132 cents in the first example and 154 cents in<br/>the second. In remote transpositions, this notation can become<br/>somewhat obscure, especially if one is not intimately familiar<br/>with a given tuning system.</p><p>Thus Ap-B or Dp-E in the first example readily suggests some kind<br/>of &quot;plus-tone&quot; interval as expected for the central step of a<br/>Chahargah tetrachord, here the less telling result of a regular<br/>minor third at 286 cents (i.e. a tone plus a koron here equal to<br/>a usual 77-cent limma). The second example is more musically<br/>idiomatic but notationally obscure, using the spelling C&gt;-D# or<br/>F&gt;-G# to show an augmented second C-D# or F-G# less a sori! Only<br/>when we know that an augmented second in this regular tuning is<br/>equal to 341 cents, and the sori in this context to 77 cents, can<br/>we determine that the resulting step is our desired 264 cents.</p><p>In some of the best 17-note systems, including the tar tunings of<br/>adept Persian musicians, step and interval sizes may in fact vary<br/>continually as one moves about the system. An outstanding example<br/>of this variability which is still emerging in its full 17-note<br/>or 18-note form is your Aulos/Soria tuning.  While a complete<br/>17-note version would obviously be required to appreciate the<br/>fuller potential of the system, your admirable subset will<br/>suffice to illustrate some Persian notation.</p><p>Let us again begin with Shur, taking C as the final, as in your<br/>discussion of the placement of Bb in this version of the tuning<br/>at around 7/4:<br/>                                          631<br/>                                           Gp<br/>                                        137|71<br/>  G    Ap    Bb     C     Dp     Eb     F     G    Ap    Bb     C<br/>-497  -357  -226    0    137    283    495   703   843   974  1200<br/>    140   132   226   137   146     212   208   140   132   226</p><p>Given the inherent limitations of a 12-note chromatic scale in<br/>contrast to a set of 17 or more notes, we must choose only one<br/>form of the degree Ap/Ab -- here the koron rather than the flat,<br/>which thus appears both a sixth above and a third below the<br/>final. This choice agrees with Ibn Sina&apos;s famous septimal tuning<br/>we have celebrated here, with the G-C tetrachord at 140-132-226<br/>cents nicely approximating one interpretation of his tetrachord<br/>at 12:13:14:16 (0-139-267-498 cents) or 139-128-231 cents. Indeed<br/>your coherent ratio of 12443:10638 or 271.329 cents is very close<br/>to 7:6, and comparable to an interval of 12 commas in Pythagorean<br/>tuning or 53-ET. Further, unlike my tuning, the distinction<br/>between the two subtly unequal Zalzalian steps at 13:12 and 14:13<br/>is here respected!</p><p>While with 12 notes we must choose one form for the sixth above<br/>the final (or third below it), nevertheless the motaqayyer of Gp<br/>at 631 cents is very nicely placed; this inflected step could be<br/>used as the highest note of a phrase seeking to descend toward<br/>the final (e.g. F-Gp-G-Eb-Dp-D), or in conjunction with Ap rather<br/>than the Ab more common for a descending gesture in a fuller<br/>tuning set (e.g. Ap-Gp-F...).</p><p>While realizing a complete Esfahan taking advantage of the ideal<br/>position for a Buzurg type of tetrachord below the final at G#-C#<br/>(or Ap-Dp) in this version would require a step at D# (a tone<br/>above the final), the tetrachord itself is most noteworthy:</p><p>          G#                  C#<br/>          Ap    Bb      C     Dp<br/>          0     132    357   494<br/>            132     226   137</p><p>Again, unlike Farhat&apos;s 135-225-135 or my 132-231-132, the two<br/>Zalzalian steps are very subtly unequal.</p><p>For Dastgah-e Segah, taken as Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim with the modern<br/>final placed on the third step, a final of Bb serves best:</p><p>       F#     G#           B      C#          E      F#<br/>       Gp     Ap    Bb     Cp     Dp    Eb    Fp     Gp<br/>       0     211   343    494     706   851  989    1200<br/>         211    132    151    211    146   138   211</p><p>The lower tetrachord at 211-132-151 cents nicely approximates Ibn<br/>Sina&apos;s 204-139-154 (F#-B), while the conjunct upper tetrachord at<br/>C#-F# at 211-146-138 cents has a different ordering of the<br/>neutral step sizes. If we are looking to approximate 13/8 more<br/>closely, and are ready to run with a 480-cent fourth (comparable<br/>to narrow fourths mentioned by Near Eastern theorists or measured in<br/>practice), then we might try:</p><p>                    G#                   C#<br/>       F      G     Ap     Bb      C     Dp   Eb     F<br/>       0     208   348    480     705   842  988    1200<br/>         211    132    151    226    137   146   212</p><p>Now the tetrachords F-Bb and Bb-Eb both have the smaller neutral<br/>second first: 211-132-151 and 226-137-146. In addition to a<br/>near-just 13/8 at 842 cents, we get the interesting variation of<br/>a near-just 11/9 at 348 cents in the lower tetrachord -- with<br/>this 11/9 from the perspective of Ibn Sina&apos;s Mustaqim serving as<br/>the modern final of Segah.</p><p>As it happens, the spellings with flats and korons are identical<br/>to those at one placement of the final occurring in Persian<br/>practice, with the modern final at Ap.</p><p>Finally, let us consider Chahargah. In soria12.scl, the tuning<br/>structure calls for us to place the final on C, also the final of<br/>Shur:</p><p>                G#                C#<br/>         G      Ap      B   C     Dp     E   F<br/>         0      140    423 497   634    917 992<br/>            140     283  74   137   283   74</p><p>The result is generally quite similar to 17-ET. Although Jean<br/>During does not include Dastgah-e Chahargah in his brief table<br/>comparing the intonations of some leading performers, he does<br/>report on a similar tetrachord in Dastgah-e Homayun where Mahmud<br/>Karimi in a vocal performance used a middle step measured at<br/>about 70.7 savarts or 282 cents, very close to a just 28:17 or<br/>17-ET. Other performers often used steps closer to 7:6, thus<br/>fitting Farhat&apos;s suggested size of around 270 cents. A 17-note<br/>version of Soria with a larger complement of near-septimal minor<br/>thirds may make this type of interpretation possible at a number<br/>of locations.</p><p>Even in this 12-note version, the coherently rational Soria<br/>system reveals a wealth of intervals shadings and nuances; the<br/>17-MOS of my 24-note regular temperament at 704.607 cents offers<br/>more &quot;predictability&quot; but less variety or ability to observe<br/>subtleties such as the distinction between 14:13 and 13:12; and a<br/>tar fretting like Farhat&apos;s seeks an apt ordering of intervals<br/>such as smaller and larger neutral seconds to fit the musician&apos;s<br/>conception of the qualities each dastgah in its most common<br/>location or locations.</p><p>As Tala&grave;i discusses at some length, such schemes bring into play<br/>the reality of &quot;temperament,&quot; a term which to him means<br/>especially the everyday situation where one transposes a given<br/>tetrachord to a location where its interval sizes differ somewhat<br/>from the ideal. Thus someone favoring the diverse sizes of a<br/>system like Soria will be in good company.</p><p>My main purpose here has been to illustrate some uses of the<br/>koron and sori symbols, while attempting to put these symbols in<br/>some musical context.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div>
