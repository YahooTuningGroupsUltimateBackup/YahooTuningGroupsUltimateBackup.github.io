However, there is NO reason why<br/>it must be confined to that.  It can include the linear relationship<br/>between ANY pitches, and does not ADVOCATE ANY style... at least, I&apos;m<br/>not seeing how you could say that...</p><p>&gt; Harmony, at least vertical harmony, is more sensitive to tuning.</p><p>Yes, true.  But harmony is also more susceptible to rules and<br/>formulas... Therefore all your &quot;traditional&quot; harmony courses... I<br/>must be followed by vi, must be followed by ii, etc., etc.  I believe<br/>that &quot;rule making&quot; would pertain to xenharmonic systems as well.<br/>Counterpoint is &quot;freer&quot; in nature, since each note is not so bound by<br/>&quot;regulations&quot; of whatever nature, to another note...</p><p>Once you decide how you want the chords tuned, they have to stay<br/>close to that or the music suffers.</p><p>Yawohl!

That&apos;s because it&apos;s become a set of rules that are<br/>&gt; independent of the sound of pure triads that started it all.</p><p>I think you would have just as many &quot;rules&quot; with that kind of<br/>harmony....

No great composers ever followed the<br/>&quot;rules,&quot; anyway.  I&apos;m just saying that, by its nature, there are more<br/>&quot;rules&quot; in harmony than in counterpoint.

Whereas counterpoint pulls weakly<br/>&gt; towards some simple, closed system, but will happily adapt to any<br/>&gt; environment you place it in.</p><p>Naah...  Counterpoint is whatever you want to make of it.  It only<br/>goes toward a &quot;closed system&quot; if that is the objective.  There is<br/>nothing INHERENT in it that makes it do that.  Getting out of my area<br/>of &quot;expertise&quot; for a moment, whatever that is, most probably Margo<br/>would agree that in the Middle Ages and Renaissance there was lots of<br/>counterpoint going on that was in &quot;open&quot; rather than &quot;closed&quot;<br/>systems...  Or, at least, musicians hadn&apos;t totally figured out how or<br/>why to &quot;close them all up&quot; yet!</p><p>So harmony is actively, and counterpoint passively xenharmonic.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Oh, I would disagree entirely.  Harmony is &quot;restrictive&quot; and<br/>DISCOURAGES xenharmonics, since the old &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;chords&quot; are so<br/>ingrained.  Counterpoint is freer.  People can &quot;bend&quot; pitches, and<br/>things do not always coincide, so there is more &quot;liberty.&quot;  This can<br/>lead to intentional or unintentional xenharmonicity...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; At least, that&apos;s the crazy theory I came up with...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>I&apos;m on the other side of this issue.

I remember once reading that<br/>the Russian film director Vsevolod Pudovkin conducted some experiments<br/>were he would film say an expressionless close-up of an actor and then<br/>splice that same shot so that it would follow footage of things like a<br/>plate of soup, a young girl lying dead in her coffin, a child at play.<br/>He would then show the finished results to an audience who had to tell<br/>what they had seen. They all noticed how the actor gazed hungrily at<br/>the soup, sadly at the death scene, happily at the child, and yet they<br/>had all seen the same impassive face each time.</p><p>I think it&apos;s possible to do many like things with less clinical and<br/>more subtle results given the proper set of circumstances. The<br/>Turntable Quartet pieces I had up at the tuning punks site for quite a<br/>while were super bare boned studies in strict quodlibet and manual<br/>adaptive retuning on the fly. And I think the use of familiar<br/>structural source material only heightened what I could get away<br/>with... what sorts of rhythms pitches and harmonies the ear could<br/>accept as &quot;normal&quot;.</p><p>I would think that the foremost practitioner of this type of<br/>&quot;polyphony&quot; today is still Henry Brant: As far back as 1950 Brant had<br/>come to feel that single-style music could no longer evoke the new<br/>stresses, layered insanities, and multidirectional assaults of<br/>contemporary life.</p><p>Interestingly the effect of certain Brant simultaneities (&quot;Western<br/>Springs&quot; for example) is not altogether different from some of the<br/>phasing and massed effects that I would associate with say Xenakis.<br/>And the other day I mentioned Xenakis because he used a sort of<br/>statistical density (like that of rain on a roof where the overall<br/>sound is quite unambiguous but the individual rain drops are) but<br/>thought that the increasing density of linear polyphony contained the<br/>seeds of its own destruction. So clearly he did not see statistical<br/>density as a type of polyphony. And by extension I would say not a<br/>type of counterpoint either.</p><p>The moral of the story...? I guess that it&apos;s very difficult to<br/>precisely pinpoint any exact line between polyphonic density and<br/>statistical density. But I think if you allow for as liberal a<br/>definition of counterpoint as Joseph Pehrson has been hinting at, then<br/>counterpoint can also easily include music whose very design is a<br/>direct opposition to &quot;counterpoint&quot;. So, some manageable definition or<br/>clear-cut meaning is probably not such a bad idea here either!</p><p>Anyway, the effect I generally go for there is one of unity as opposed<br/>to clash. This is why I mentioned the density of the Natural world.<br/>But unlike Xenakis, I&apos;m not so much interested in too literal an<br/>analogy (though I think his is fascinating).</p><p>To me the analogy or model is much more like some sort of<br/>protean-psychoid phenomena that is very much linked to the observer.<br/>So for me these things are more like autobiographical talismans that<br/>hope to take advantage of music&apos;s ability to express and &quot;say&quot; what<br/>words can&apos;t.</p><p>The Natural world that I&apos;m interested in is very much akin to &quot;the<br/>land beyond the rim&quot; of Sigurd Olson. And expressing something of that<br/>impact *emotionally*, however imperfectly as a direct analogy, is what<br/>it&apos;s really all about in the end for me. And over the years I&apos;ve found<br/>that polychromatic densities have often been some of the most<br/>user-friendly structural devices when it comes to getting some of this<br/>business up and off the ground.

And more and more rules for harmony.</p><p>Rules for harmony will tend to fix it into a particular tuning.  But then<br/>new harmonies will suggest new tunings.  It seems harmony is continuously<br/>evolving.  Now that economics and technology allow for it, so can tuning.</p><p>&gt; &gt;  Today, 12-equal is no<br/>&gt; &gt; longer xenharmonic, so counterpoint is happy staying where it is,<br/>&gt; but harmony leads us on to new sonorities and new tunings.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems to me that BOTH counterpoint and harmony are constantly<br/>&gt; changing in new music, depending on the composer and style...</p><p>Counterpoint can change a lot within a closed pitch set without needing to<br/>escape.  But harmony, given its freedom, will always want new notes to<br/>play with.  We&apos;ve seen that there&apos;s a lot of variety possible within the<br/>same few notes.  When instruments are expensive, and all built around the<br/>same tuning, that&apos;s the only kind of variety you&apos;d expect to see.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Except that &quot;harmony&quot; as covered in universities is also rooted to<br/>&gt; &gt; 12-equal.  That&apos;s because it&apos;s become a set of rules that are<br/>&gt; &gt; independent of the sound of pure triads that started it all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you would have just as many &quot;rules&quot; with that kind of<br/>&gt; harmony.... In fact, you might have MORE rules.  Look at all the<br/>&gt; &quot;rules&quot; that John deLaubenfels has in his ADAPTIVE just intonation.<br/>&gt; It takes a constantly number-crunching computer to figure out all the<br/>&gt; rules!</p><p>Adaptive tuning is a way of getting the two sets of rules to work<br/>together.  Rules about pure triads would naturally tend towards 5-limit<br/>JI, and leave the commas to be discovered.</p><p>&gt; Maybe<br/>&gt; &gt; those rules became too powerful, so you could still write great<br/>&gt; music following them while all the time the chords became dulled<br/>&gt; through the excesses of temperament.  And the engineering principle<br/>&gt; of &quot;do the simplest thing that can possibly work&quot; took over.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ummm.  I&apos;m not following this.  No great composers ever followed the<br/>&gt; &quot;rules,&quot; anyway.  I&apos;m just saying that, by its nature, there are more<br/>&gt; &quot;rules&quot; in harmony than in counterpoint.  Take a few courses in both<br/>&gt; subjects, and you&apos;ll see what I mean!</p><p>It would be out of all proportion to go to such lengths in order to win an<br/>argument.</p><p>I have two Mozart pieces here (K573 and K300h) both of which end on a V-I<br/>progression.  That&apos;s the rule I would have expected him to follow.  He<br/>obviously did something right, because once you get the hang of it it&apos;s<br/>easy to tell when a Mozart piece finishes.  So the rule works.  The old<br/>rule used to be to end on a consonance and have the music finish with a<br/>semitone.  But if you can establish the key, bringing in V and I does the<br/>trick without them needing to be so consonant.</p><p>If you hear enough of them, you come to associate major chords with stable<br/>consonances, even if they&apos;ve been tempered so far as to lose the<br/>brilliance of a pure consonance.  So the rules invented for consonances<br/>can transfer over to their approximations in Equal Temperament.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As I see it, harmony, when it&apos;s important, pulls strongly towards<br/>&gt; &gt; those tunings it resonates with.  Whereas counterpoint pulls weakly<br/>&gt; &gt; towards some simple, closed system, but will happily adapt to any<br/>&gt; &gt; environment you place it in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Naah...  Counterpoint is whatever you want to make of it.  It only<br/>&gt; goes toward a &quot;closed system&quot; if that is the objective.  There is<br/>&gt; nothing INHERENT in it that makes it do that.</p><p>Counterpoint has an inherent tendency to enlarge the gamut of an open<br/>system.  It also has no inherent problem with the system closing.</p><p>&gt;  Getting out of my area<br/>&gt; of &quot;expertise&quot; for a moment, whatever that is, most probably Margo<br/>&gt; would agree that in the Middle Ages and Renaissance there was lots of<br/>&gt; counterpoint going on that was in &quot;open&quot; rather than &quot;closed&quot;<br/>&gt; systems...  Or, at least, musicians hadn&apos;t totally figured out how or<br/>&gt; why to &quot;close them all up&quot; yet!</p><p>According to Watkins (p.182) &quot;Gesualdo&apos;s introduction of chromatic<br/>semitones in each instance is only a mildly unconventional licence<br/>reflecting the contrapuntal theory of the time, which considered B and Bb<br/>and F and F# as contrapuntally identical&quot;.  That suggests, to me, a closed<br/>system of 7 pitch classes.  Which isn&apos;t what Gesualdo was really working<br/>with, as most examples are &quot;correct&quot; for both 7 and 12 pitch classes, and<br/>the music as a whole requires more then 7.  But it seems likely to me that<br/>the theory is a throwback to a time when counterpoint (but not harmony)<br/>did work with a closed system of 7 classes to the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So harmony is actively, and counterpoint passively xenharmonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, I would disagree entirely.  Harmony is &quot;restrictive&quot; and<br/>&gt; DISCOURAGES xenharmonics, since the old &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;chords&quot; are so<br/>&gt; ingrained.</p><p>This may be true of the variety of harmony you were taught.</p><p>&gt; Counterpoint is freer.  People can &quot;bend&quot; pitches, and<br/>&gt; things do not always coincide, so there is more &quot;liberty.&quot;  This can<br/>&gt; lead to intentional or unintentional xenharmonicity...</p><p>This doesn&apos;t contradict anything I said.</p><p>               Graham</p></div><h3><a id=20602 href="#20602">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>3/31/2001 1:09:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; This is why I&apos;ve become interested in the 16th and early 17th<br/>&gt; &gt; centuries.

Beyond that, it&apos;s undergraduate<br/>assignments that turn those rules into formulas that have to be<br/>strict because it&apos;s harder to grade imagination.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Pehrson:</p><p>Ummm, it goes through most of the courses unless you happen to have a<br/>particularly &quot;enlightened&quot; instructor.  Traditional<br/>harmony courses are taught as a set of rules, just like poor music<br/>history courses are taught as a set of dates.  And yes, they ARE<br/>easier to grade, of course (all thinking optional...)</p><p>Breed:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not sure music can really be xenharmonic without rules making<br/>it so.  Otherwise, you&apos;d convert it to 12-equal to make it easier to<br/>play.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Pehrson:</p><p>I can&apos;t see why xenharmonic music would have any more or fewer rules<br/>than 12-tET or anything else...  It all depends on how you want to<br/>use it... Perhaps I don&apos;t see the &quot;conversion to 12-tET&quot; as such a<br/>strong pull presently...</p><p>Breed:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;  Today, 12-equal is no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; longer xenharmonic, so counterpoint is happy staying where it<br/>is, but harmony leads us on to new sonorities and new tunings.</p><p>Pehrson:</p><p>I&apos;m not getting this, since as soon as you change your basic sound<br/>material, your scalar materials, the counterpoint changes equally as<br/>well...</p><p>Breed:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Counterpoint can change a lot within a closed pitch set without<br/>needing to escape.  But harmony, given its freedom, will always want<br/>new notes to play with.</p><p>Pehrson:</p><p>Not necessarily.  What are Phillip Glass and Arvo Part all about??</p><p>Breed:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Except that &quot;harmony&quot; as covered in universities is also rooted<br/>to 12-equal.  That&apos;s because it&apos;s become a set of rules that are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; independent of the sound of pure triads that started it all.<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>Pehrson:</p><p>Well, gee, Grahm... why not go back even FURTHER than that to<br/>Pythagorean??  I think the rules change over time for each period and<br/>EQUALLY for BOTH harmony and counterpoint.  In MY view (probably<br/>stemming from Schoenberg studies) counterpoint leads to NEW harmonies<br/>and new possibilities and harmony seems more &quot;codified&quot; for a given<br/>period....  It&apos;s obviously just a viewpoint.</p><p>Breed:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; As I see it, harmony, when it&apos;s important, pulls strongly<br/>towards those tunings it resonates with.  Whereas counterpoint pulls<br/>weakly towards some simple, closed system, but will happily adapt to<br/>any environment you place it in.<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>Pehrson:<br/>&gt; &gt; Naah...  Counterpoint is whatever you want to make of it.  It<br/>only goes toward a &quot;closed system&quot; if that is the objective.  There<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; nothing INHERENT in it that makes it do that.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Breed:</p><p>&gt; Counterpoint has an inherent tendency to enlarge the gamut of an<br/>open system.  It also has no inherent problem with the system closing.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Pehrson:</p><p>There you go!  So it has an incredible flexibility.  It can increase<br/>an open system and can be extremely flexible in a closed system.  So<br/>it really doesn&apos;t have any given TENDENCY to move toward a CLOSED<br/>system, unless one wants it to!</p><p>Breed:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; So harmony is actively, and counterpoint passively xenharmonic.<br/>&gt; &gt;</p><p>Pehrson:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Oh, I would disagree entirely.  Harmony is &quot;restrictive&quot; and<br/>&gt; &gt; DISCOURAGES xenharmonics, since the old &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;chords&quot; are<br/>so ingrained.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Breed:</p><p>&gt; This may be true of the variety of harmony you were taught.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Pehrson:</p><p>Well, it&apos;s just &quot;standard Western practice.&quot;  Maybe your Mathieu book<br/>is more &quot;all-encompassing.&quot;  Drat... more money to <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>.</p><p>So basically, Graham, when we go to a Deli, I will order counterpoint<br/>in my sandwich and you can have all the harmony in yours that you<br/>want.  My sandwich will be leaner and tastier and I will emerge a<br/>healthier individual for having ingested it!</p><p>_______ ______ _____ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=20639 href="#20639">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2001 4:08:10 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20520.html#20604">/tuning/topicId_20520.html#20604</a></p><p>&gt; Pehrson:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I would see a closed system, then, as possibly providing more<br/>&gt; OPPORTUNITIES for literal counterpoint.  But counterpoint needn&apos;t be<br/>&gt; literal in order to be defined by that term...</p><p>If it isn&apos;t literal, it cares even less how it&apos;s being tuned.  You<br/>have to take consonances literally, or they stop being consonant.</p><p>&gt; Pehrson:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How can Roman Numeral analysis be used for anything other than<br/>&gt; VERTICAL harmony??  Generally that&apos;s the usage one sees... (with<br/>&gt; broader implications, of course)</p><p>The vi of C major is the same as the ii of G major.  If you take a<br/>minor triad in isolation, it matters very much how it&apos;s tuned.  I<br/>think harmony should concern itself more with the sounds of chords,<br/>and by implication how they are tuned.  This has to be left out of<br/>traditional accounts because they assume a particular tuning.</p><p>If you&apos;re using the sonorities of the harmonic series, there&apos;s a<br/>maximum amount of temperament you can use without the chords sounding<br/>wrong.  This leads you into xenharmonic considerations before you even<br/>start to think about how one chord relates to the other.  Some<br/>consider any form of temperament to be unacceptable, and this has been<br/>a driving force behind xenharmonic innovation over the past century.</p><p>Horizontal harmony can have xenharmonic implications.  I think the<br/>tendency to narrow leading tones counts as harmony.  But it can also<br/>require temperament, like the way diatonic scales imply a tempering<br/>away of the syntonic comma.  Beyond that, two major chords a semitone<br/>apart could look like this:</p><p>  E---B---F#<br/> / \ /<br/>C---G<br/> \ /<br/>  Eb</p><p>You can&apos;t get all the 5-limit intervals, both horizontal and vertical,<br/>to be in tune at the same time.  So you could smudge it into Equal<br/>Temperament, or give one of the chords a car-horn third in meantone.</p><p>When you start to consider this kind of thing, I&apos;m not at all sure<br/>what would be &quot;harmony&quot; and what &quot;counterpoint&quot;.</p><p>In functional harmony, to understand the progression you only need<br/>consider the roots.  By blurring the distinctions between different<br/>chords, this also removes tuning from the picture.  Perhaps that was<br/>the intention.</p><p>&gt; Breed:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And there&apos;s a lot more to harmony than the &quot;traditional&quot;<br/>&gt; (presumably Common Practice) kind.  Palestrina doesn&apos;t seem to be<br/>&gt; following those rules, Margo showed us a different set of rules for<br/>&gt; earlier music, and the past century has thrown up a wide range of<br/>new<br/>&gt; ideas.  I include all these, and those yet to come, as &quot;harmony&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pehrson:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well yes, of course you can do that if you wish.  However, it isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; the &quot;generally accepted&quot; usage of the term...  But, who cares...I<br/>&gt; would also prefer an &quot;expanded&quot; definition...</p><p>I don&apos;t think a subject should be constrained by the rules it is<br/>conventionally explained by.  Any sounding together of notes implies<br/>&quot;harmony&quot;.  That seems obvious to me, if it goes against the accepted<br/>usage perhaps we need a new word.</p><p>&gt; Breed:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Today, 12-equal is no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; longer xenharmonic, so counterpoint is happy staying where it<br/>&gt; is, but harmony leads us on to new sonorities and new tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pehrson:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not getting this, since as soon as you change your basic sound<br/>&gt; material, your scalar materials, the counterpoint changes equally as<br/>&gt; well...</p><p>Yes, but the counterpoint takes a passive, rather than active, role.</p><p>&gt; Breed:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Counterpoint can change a lot within a closed pitch set without<br/>&gt; needing to escape.  But harmony, given its freedom, will always want<br/>&gt; new notes to play with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pehrson:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not necessarily.  What are Phillip Glass and Arvo Part all about??</p><p>Not all composers will use the freedom to expand.  But the return to<br/>simple consonances should also lead to a return to the purity of those<br/>consonances.</p><p>&gt; Pehrson:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, gee, Grahm... why not go back even FURTHER than that to<br/>&gt; Pythagorean??  I think the rules change over time for each period<br/>and<br/>&gt; EQUALLY for BOTH harmony and counterpoint.  In MY view (probably<br/>&gt; stemming from Schoenberg studies) counterpoint leads to NEW<br/>harmonies<br/>&gt; and new possibilities and harmony seems more &quot;codified&quot; for a given<br/>&gt; period....  It&apos;s obviously just a viewpoint.</p><p>The codification of harmony often happens in retrospect.  Trabaci,<br/>within his limited gamut, was happy to mis-spell a diminished triad,<br/>but not major or minor.  I don&apos;t think any rules of his time, or<br/>standard harmony texts, would explain that.  But *we* can say it was<br/>okay for him to use a 7-limit third as the tritone already implies<br/>7-limit harmony.</p><p>The consonances of the Common Practice era can&apos;t be expressed in<br/>Pythagorean intonation.  Although some modern rules can be traced back<br/>that far, like the use of contrast between consonance and dissonance,<br/>and the preference for semitone motion in cadences.  Making thirds<br/>consonant meant the tuning had to change.</p><p>&gt; Pehrson:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Naah...  Counterpoint is whatever you want to make of it.  It<br/>&gt; only goes toward a &quot;closed system&quot; if that is the objective.

So<br/>&gt; it really doesn&apos;t have any given TENDENCY to move toward a CLOSED<br/>&gt; system, unless one wants it to!</p><p>Nothing happens in music unless you want it to.  But composers will<br/>tend towards the simplest system that allows them to do what they<br/>want.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, I would disagree entirely.  Harmony is &quot;restrictive&quot; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; DISCOURAGES xenharmonics, since the old &quot;rules&quot; and &quot;chords&quot; are<br/>&gt; so ingrained.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Breed:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This may be true of the variety of harmony you were taught.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pehrson:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, it&apos;s just &quot;standard Western practice.&quot;  Maybe your Mathieu<br/>book<br/>&gt; is more &quot;all-encompassing.&quot;  Drat... more money to <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s a book on traditional harmony, which goes as far as Jazz.  But I<br/>don&apos;t know if you&apos;d find it that helpful if you&apos;ve already gone<br/>through the usual system.  The chapters on JI vocal technique might be<br/>different.</p><p>&gt; So basically, Graham, when we go to a Deli, I will order<br/>counterpoint<br/>&gt; in my sandwich and you can have all the harmony in yours that you<br/>&gt; want.  My sandwich will be leaner and tastier and I will emerge a<br/>&gt; healthier individual for having ingested it!</p><p>I don&apos;t know how you could have one without the other.
