He may choose to analyze music and even<br/>have gifts for doing so; but from them mathematical point of view, music is<br/>just  another pattern.  For the musician, however, the patterned elements<br/>must  appear in sounds; and they are finally and firmly put together in<br/>certain ways  not by virtue of formal consideration, but because they have<br/>expressive power  and effects.&quot;</p><p>This quote is by Howard Gardner from his book on multiple intelligences:<br/>Frames of Mind.

This is caste-system tripe. Not counting the obvious objection that there are people who are clearly &quot;both&quot;, so much for segregation, there&apos;s also the fact that for all I know, solving a thorny equation is as pleasurable to some, in a different way, as a roll in the doughnut batter with the hod-carrier&apos;s daughter would be to others.</p><p>Take a look at what is really going on around us. Turn on the radio: talk about patterns! There&apos;s almost nothing but very simple patterns, and extremely strict ones at that. And what happens if you break these patterns? Why, a great number of people will say you&apos;re being &quot;cerebral&quot; and your music is &quot;intellectual&quot; and &quot;mathmatical&quot;. Black is white! Almost every chump I&apos;ve come across whining about effect and expression listens almost exclusively to violently limited 4/4 12-tET pattern-bound music. Expression my ass, more like celebrating the rainbow of colors you can paint a policemen&apos;s baton.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene:<br/>&gt; The quote assumes lovers of music and mathematicians, and even more<br/>&gt; composers of music and mathematicians, represent disjoint sets.
