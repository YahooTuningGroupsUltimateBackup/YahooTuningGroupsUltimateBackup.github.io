Neo-Gothic hypermeantones: a plethora of prime limits<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Our hypermeantones with pure 9:7 or 7:6 thirds, and the closely<br/>related 22-tet and 27-tet, occupy a fascinating realm situated at<br/>the farther end of the neo-Gothic spectrum and the middle region of<br/>the larger hypermeantone spectrum from Pythagorean to 5-tet. The<br/>following chart illustrates this overview:</p><p>    0                  ~+7.14    ~+9.15                         ~+18.04<br/> ~701.96              ~709.09   ~711.11                            720<br/>    |---------------------|--------|--------------------------------|<br/>  Pyth                 22-tet    27-tet                           5-tet<br/>    |----------------------...........? ? ?<br/>           Neo-Gothic spectrum</p><p>Tempering our fifths and fourths by 1/4 or 1/3 septimal comma involves<br/>a modest adjustment in comparison to many world musics favoring<br/>intonations closer to 5-tet, but a rather dramatic compromise from a<br/>European medievalist perspective centered on Pythagorean ratios of 3:2<br/>and 4:3.</p><p>For many timbres, 22-tet (fifths ~7.14 cents wide) may approach the<br/>upper limit of the neo-Gothic spectrum; 27-tet (fifths ~9.15 cents<br/>wide) may require special &quot;care and feeding&quot; in a neo-Gothic context,<br/>but very convincingly succeeds with a somewhat gamelan-like timbre.</p><p>Just as 7-limit thirds provide &quot;prime attractions&quot; (pun intended) in<br/>the far neo-Gothic zone reaching out to 22-tet and beyond, so other<br/>regions offer their own prime attractors. Here I would like very<br/>partially to survey the near neo-Gothic zone between Pythagorean and<br/>17-tet, suggesting a musical universe with a plethora of prime limits<br/>and commas.</p><p>Starting at Pythagorean tuning, we find that the 81:64 major third is<br/>smaller than 19:15 (~409.24 cents) by only a small comma of 1216:1215,<br/>or ~1.42 cents. As it happens, 41-tet (fifths ~702.44 cents, ~0.48<br/>cents wide) slightly exceeds the tempering required for pure 19:15<br/>thirds (fifths ~702.31 cents, ~0.35 cents wide), making these<br/>intervals about 0.51 cents wide.</p><p>To specify the hypermeantone with pure 19:15 major thirds, we might<br/>use either of these notations:</p><p>1/4-(1216:1215)-hypermeantone<br/>1/4-(19:15/81:64)-hypermeantone</p><p>Either notation shows that the fifth in this hypermeantone -- roughly<br/>approximated by 41-tet -- is tempered by 1/4 of the 1216:1215 comma by<br/>which 19:15 exceeds the Pythagorean 81:64.[15]</p><p>Suppose that we desire a hypermeantone with pure 13:11 minor thirds,<br/>which are narrower than the usual Pythagorean 32:27 by a comma of<br/>352:351 (~4.93 cents). Our tuning has fifths at ~703.59 cents, or<br/>about 1.64 cents wider than pure; 29-tet at ~703.45 cents (fifths<br/>~1.49 cents wide) features minor thirds at ~289.66 cents, or ~0.45<br/>cents wider than 13:11 (~289.21 cents).</p><p>We may therefore say that 29-tet approximates a meantone notated in<br/>either of these ways:</p><p>1/3-(352:351)-hypermeantone<br/>1/3-(32:27/13:11)-hypermeantone</p><p>Continuing our journey from Pythagorean toward 17-tet, we might seek a<br/>major third at a pure 14:11 (~417.51 cents), which exceeds the<br/>Pythagorean 81:64 by a comma of 896:891 (~9.69 cents). Our tuning has<br/>a fifth of ~704.38 cents (~2.42 cents wide), almost identical to<br/>46-tet with a fifth of ~704.35 cents (~2.39 cents wide) and a major<br/>third of 417.39 cents -- a difference of only ~0.12 cents.</p><p>We accordingly find 46-tet almost identical to the tuning alternately<br/>notated as</p><p>1/4-(896:891)-hypermeantone<br/>1/4-(14:11/81:64)-hypermeantone</p><p>While we have so far focused on major and minor thirds, other types of<br/>intervals may also serve as the basis for hypermeantone tunings and<br/>approximations. Suppose that we wish to make the &quot;odd&quot; fourth of a<br/>12-note tuning chain -- actually an augmented third, e.g. Eb-G# --<br/>have a pure 11:8 ratio (~551.32 cents).</p><p>Our 11:8 interval exceeds a usual Pythagorean augmented third or &quot;Wolf<br/>fourth&quot; at 177147:131072 by a comma of 180224:177147, or ~29.81 cents,<br/>an amount slightly larger than the septimal comma we encountered in<br/>Section 2. Here, however, we can spread this comma over 11 fifths or<br/>fourths, producing a fifth of ~704.67 cents (~2.71 cents wide).</p><p>As it happens, an &quot;e-based hypermeantone&quot; I have proposed with a ratio<br/>between the whole-tone and diatonic semitone equal to Euler&apos;s _e_<br/>(~2.71828) closely approximates this result with a fifth at ~704.61<br/>cents (~2.65 cents wide), and an augmented third at ~550.68 cents, or<br/>about 0.64 cents narrower than 11:8.</p><p>We might say that the e-based tuning approximates our pure 11:8 tuning<br/>notated by the forms</p><p>1/11-(180224:177147)-hypermeantone<br/>1/11-(11:8/177147:131072)-hypermeantone</p><p>Arriving at 17-tet, we encounter two general issues of tuning theory:<br/>do very high prime-limits have a distinctive musical flavor, and if<br/>so, how large is the &quot;zone of attraction&quot; within which a tempered<br/>interval should fall in order to communicate this flavor for a given<br/>limit?</p><p>The 17-tet minor third at ~282.35 cents is rather close to a pure<br/>20:17 ratio at ~281.36 cents -- a difference of ~0.99 cents. The<br/>17-tet fifth at ~705.88 cents (~3.93 cents wide) compares with the<br/>fifth at ~706.21 cents (~4.25 cents wide) needed to produce 17:10<br/>minor thirds. Such a tuning would disperse the comma by which the<br/>Pythagorean 32:27 exceeds 20:17 -- 136:135, ~12.78 cents -- over a<br/>chain of three fourths. We could notate this tuning by the forms</p><p>1/3-(136:135)-hypermeantone<br/>1/3-(32:27/20:17)-hypermeantone</p><p>If we grant that 17-odd-limit ratios are musically distinctive, then<br/>the question remans as to whether a 17-tet minor third with its<br/>variance of about 1 cent from 17:10 has a flavor of &quot;17-ness.&quot;</p><p>The 17-tet major third at ~423.53 cents comparably approximates a<br/>ratio with a yet higher prime-limit, 23:18 (~424.36 cents), with a<br/>variance of ~0.83 cents. A hypermeantone with a pure 23:18 major third<br/>would have a fifth at ~706.09 cents (~4.14 cents wider than pure),<br/>dispersing over four fifths the comma of 736:729 by which 23:18<br/>exceeds the Pythagorean 81:64. We could notate this tuning:</p><p>1/4-(736:729)-hypermeantone<br/>1/4-(23:18/81:64)-hypermeantone</p><p>Here we confront the issues of whether a pure ratio such as 23:18 has<br/>a distinctive &quot;23-ness&quot; -- and, if so, whether the 17-tet major third<br/>with its variance of ~0.83 cents approaches its &quot;zone of attraction&quot;<br/>closely enough to share this flavor.</p><p>As these examples may suggest, neo-Gothic hypermeantones can bring<br/>into play a plethora of higher prime ratios or approximations. The<br/>musical possibilities invite exploration in practice and theory.</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br/>4. A coda: hypermeantones and hypomeantones<br/>-------------------------------------------</p><p>In Section 2, we focused on hypermeantones with pure 9:7 and 7:6<br/>thirds, analogous to the familiar 1/4-comma and 1/3-comma meantone; in<br/>Section 3, we more generally surveyed a range of hypermeantones<br/>featuring or approximating a variety of higher-prime ratios.</p><p>To this point, however, we have hardly brought hypomeantones into the<br/>picture, other than to conclude that, like hypermeantones, they<br/>involve different stylistic and aesthetic considerations than the<br/>3-limit/5-limit balance of historical meantones.</p><p>However, connections between all three categories of regular tunings<br/>arise when we consider the matter of &quot;alternative thirds&quot; formed by<br/>diminished fourths or augmented seconds.</p><p>These relationships are most familiar between meantones and<br/>hypermeantones. Thus Pythagorean tuning and its immediate neighbors<br/>(e.g. 53-tet, 41-tet) feature diminished fourths or &quot;schisma thirds&quot;<br/>very close to the regular major thirds of 1/4-comma meantone at a pure<br/>5:4. In turn, 1/4-comma meantone offers diminished fourths at 32:25<br/>(~427.37 cents), comparable to the regular major thirds of a<br/>neo-Gothic hypermeantone such as 17-tet (~423.53 cents).</p><p>At other points in the hypermeantone spectrum, however, we encounter<br/>intriguing links with the alternative universe of hypomeantone.</p><p>In 22-tet, for example, the diminished fourth of 6 (9 - 3) steps,<br/>equal to a fourth minus a chromatic semitone, is ~327.27 cents, an<br/>interval somewhat larger than the pure 6:5 at ~315.64 cents. This<br/>identical interval is the regular minor third of 33-tet, formed from a<br/>whole-tone of 5 steps plus a diatonic semitone of 4 steps. Here we have<br/>have a regular fifth (19 steps) of ~690.91 cents (~11.04 cents narrow<br/>of 3:2), placing us well into the hypomeantone region.</p><p>In the e-based hypermeantone we considered in Section 3, the<br/>diminished fourth is ~363.14 cents, fairly close to 21:17 (~365.83<br/>cents). In 33-tet, the regular major third (10 steps, or two<br/>whole-tones of 5 steps each) is an almost identical ~363.64 cents.</p><p>Musically, of course, these tunings suggest quite different contexts<br/>for these almost identical sizes of thirds. In the hypermeantone<br/>setting, our near-21:17 can serve as a &quot;submajor&quot; or &quot;subditonal&quot;<br/>third inviting an expansion to the fifth with one the voices moving by<br/>a striking chromatic semitone (~132.25 cents). This &quot;special effects&quot;<br/>interval contrasts with our usual near-14:11 major third, expanding to<br/>a fifth by way of the usual compact diatonic semitone (~76.97 cents).</p><p>In the hypomeantone setting of 33-tet, our near-21:17 is the regular<br/>major third, likely playing a more pervasive role; and similarly the<br/>regular minor third at around 327 cents, a &quot;special effects&quot; interval<br/>in a Pythagorean interpretation of 22-tet where the regular minor<br/>third is rather close to 7:6 (~272.73 cents).</p><p>Suppose we seek a regular tuning featuring thirds at a pure 11:9, a<br/>common flavor of &quot;neutral third.&quot; The hypomeantone with a fifth at<br/>~686.85 cents (~15.10 cents from 3:2) will produce this interval as a<br/>regular major third -- that is, from a chain of four fifths. Here we<br/>are approaching 7-tet; we have whole-tones of ~173.70 cents, diatonic<br/>semitones of ~165.74 cents, and chromatic semitones of ~7.96 cents.<br/>This tuning might have a somewhat pelog-like flavor.</p><p>In the hypermeantone portion of the spectrum, we can obtain 11:9 as an<br/>augmented second (formed from a chain of 9 fifths) by choosing a fifth<br/>of ~705.27 cents (~3.31 cents wide), about midway between our e-based<br/>hypermeantone and 17-tet. Using the notation introduced in Section 3,<br/>we might describe this tuning in terms of the difference by which 11:9<br/>exceeds the Pythagorean augmented second 19683:16384 (~317.60 cents,<br/>very close to 6:5), a comma of 180224:177147 or ~29.81 cents[16]:</p><p>1/9-(180224:177147)-hypermeantone<br/>1/9-(11:9/19683:16384)-hypermeantone</p><p>Another choice would be to seek a diminished fourth at 11:9, calling<br/>for a fifth at ~706.57 cents, or ~4.61 cents wide, in the region<br/>between 17-tet and 39-tet. Here a chain of 8 fifths disperses the<br/>difference between the Pythagorean diminished fourth 8192:6561<br/>(~384.36 cents, very close to 5:4) and 11:9, a comma of 8192:8019 or<br/>~36.95 cents. This suggests the notations</p><p>1/8-(8192:8019)-hypermeantone<br/>1/8-(8192:6561/11:9)-hypermeantone</p><p>Having found a few &quot;bridges&quot; between the universes of hypermeantone<br/>and hypomeantone, we may have some sense of the musical richness<br/>awaiting us in both these less-travelled portions of the continuum of<br/>regular tunings.</p><p>---------------<br/>Notes to Part 2<br/>---------------</p><p>15. For 3-limit/5-limit and 3-limit/7-limit interactions, we often<br/>speak of a single syntonic comma (81:80) or septimal comma (64:63).<br/>For interactions between the 3-limit and higher prime limits, however,<br/>the relevant commas may vary from interval to interval. For example,<br/>while a 19:15 major third is larger than the Pythagorean 81:64 by a<br/>comma of 1216:1215, a 19:16 minor third is also _larger_ than the<br/>Pythagorean 32:27 by a comma of 513:512 (~3.38 cents). The sum of<br/>these two commas, 361:360 (~4.80 cents), is the amount by which a<br/>fifth formed from a pure 19:15 and a pure 19:16 (361:240, ~706.76<br/>cents) exceeds 3:2. Because of such asymmetries, I propose a notation<br/>specifying either the ratio of the comma itself or the ratios of the<br/>intervals defining this comma. The latter style can often be more<br/>&quot;user-friendly,&quot; since it explicitly identifies the relevant<br/>Pythagorean interval and the higher-limit &quot;target&quot; interval of the<br/>temperament, either of which may prompt easier recognition than a<br/>comma ratio (especially a less familiar one).</p><p>16. This comma is identical to the one we met in Section 3 between<br/>11:8 and the Pythagorean &quot;Wolf&quot; fourth or augmented third at<br/>177147:131072. To explain this equivalence we might note that an 11:9<br/>is smaller than an 11:8 by a pure 9:8; and likewise a Pythagorean<br/>augmented second at 19683:16834 is smaller than an augmented third by<br/>a regular whole-tone, the same 9:8 ratio.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
