Otherwise you have more work to do, but still,<br/>recreating the exact title will make it much easier when searching for<br/>threads.</p><p>Of course matching the original is no issue if a new thread was being<br/>started with the post that was bounced.  Nonetheless a meaningful title is<br/>helpful, as always.</p><p>Thanks to everyone who is reposting.</p><p>-Kurt Bigler</p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2003 6:15:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kurt Bigler &lt;kkb@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/46440">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/46440</a></p><p>&gt; Of course matching the original is no issue if a new thread was<br/>being<br/>&gt; started with the post that was bounced.
