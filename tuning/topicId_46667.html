Apparently trite, but cool<br/>(so maybe only deceptively trite).  And the timbre, music and<br/>tuning remind me of Blackwood&apos;s work in 19-tET.  But the<br/>question I wanna ask: what does this tell us about Gene&apos;s<br/>retuning algorithm?  Gene&apos;s given the algorithm on tuning-math;<br/>maybe he&apos;d care to post that here.  Gene, did you try this<br/>piece with a fixed 12-tone meantone chain?</p><p>I don&apos;t have the link anymore to the ogg files, and can&apos;t find<br/>them on Gene&apos;s site.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=46669 href="#46669">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2003 9:51:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Carl Lumma &lt;ekin@l...&gt; wrote:</p><p>Gene&apos;s given the algorithm on tuning-math;<br/>&gt; maybe he&apos;d care to post that here.</p><p>I tried it on Beethoven&apos;s fourth, first movement, and wasn&apos;t satisfied<br/>with the result; so I plan on starting over.
