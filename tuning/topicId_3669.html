My own analysis is that every person has a fundamental<br/>frequency in their voice, which changes when they sing or try to change<br/>it or when stressed.  Each vowel has a cycle of some number of this<br/>other cycle (with the wave sizes varying over this cycle) with that<br/>number varying from 2 to about 7.
