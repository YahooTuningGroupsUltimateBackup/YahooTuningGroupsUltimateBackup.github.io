In modern terms, he knew the positive real numbers.</p><p>(2) Aristoxenos defines the tone as the difference between a fifth and a fourth, and says it can be divided into 12 parts.</p><p>(3) He says the fourth is 2 1/2 tones, which would mean 30 parts.</p><p>(4) This gives two equations in two unknowns for the 3-limit mapping if we assume there is one, and that gives 72et up to the 3-limit. And if we assume Aristoxenos is talking in a precise and consistent way, we are stuck with having a mapping and hence stuck with 72.</p></div><h3><a id=90080 href="#90080">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2010 3:33:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Claiming 72 for Aristoxenos is a bit controversial,</p><p>You can say that twice and mean it.  -C.</p></div><h3><a id=90081 href="#90081">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2010 3:47:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Claiming 72 for Aristoxenos is a bit controversial,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can say that twice and mean it.  -C.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Doesn&apos;t it come down to whether he really meant what he said?</p></div><h3><a id=90085 href="#90085">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2010 5:23:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Claiming 72 for Aristoxenos is a bit controversial,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You can say that twice and mean it.  -C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Doesn&apos;t it come down to whether he really meant what he said?</p><p>It comes down to whether he conceived of 72 equal steps<br/>to an octave period, and I&apos;ll bake a pie if he did.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=90089 href="#90089">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/9/2010 6:00:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Claiming 72 for Aristoxenos is a bit controversial,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You can say that twice and mean it.  -C.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Doesn&apos;t it come down to whether he really meant what he said?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It comes down to whether he conceived of 72 equal steps<br/>&gt; to an octave period, and I&apos;ll bake a pie if he did.</p><p>It comes down to what he would have said if someone had asked him how many of his parts there were in an octave, and I think he would have said 72, on the grounds that he wasn&apos;t an idiot and moreover knew how to add.

As I pointed out to Carl, the actual bottom line is whether the parts he described were intended to be equal parts. Despite Ozan&apos;s belief to the contrary, it would not have required logarithms for Aristoxenos to have conceptualized such a thing, though they certainly would have helped any attempt to use actual computations.</p></div>
