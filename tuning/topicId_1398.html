But I&apos;ll give it<br/>a try since I once wrote about the subject.</p><p>Before I do though, I wanted to say that my computer crashed over the weekend and<br/>I lost all of my email between Friday night and Sunday morning  72 in all.  If<br/>there were any relevant postings to my concerns and anybody still has them, could<br/>you direct them my way.  Thanks.</p><p>MUSIC COMPOSITION FOR THE COMPLETE IDIOT</p><p>Materials:  You&apos;re going to need some basic materials.  Since you&apos;ve asked about<br/>music composition on a tuning newsletter I would imagine you are going to be<br/>working with alternate tunings.  Hence, you might find it helpful to have a<br/>tuneable keyboard(s) or other music instrument(s) available, if for no other<br/>reason than to check out an interval or chord.  In this vein, you might find a<br/>tuner helpful in double checking the exact frequency of the musical pitches you<br/>are using.  In addition, you might find a calculator handy, because some<br/>synthesizers require you to perform a formula for tuning the keyboard.</p><p>Something to compose the music to, will be the next important piece of hardware<br/>you are going to need.  If you plan to write it down you&apos;re going to need basic<br/>writing implements.  If you are going to record it, you are going to need<br/>recording equipment or music sequencing software etc.</p><p>Some background with music is helpful.  Training, education, books, music scores,<br/>recordings, music lessons and other musicians are all resources for the composer.</p><p>Then you are going to need tranquility in spades.  A quiet room, some vacation<br/>time, an uninterrupted weekend, in other words a condition that is conducive<br/>toward putting musical thoughts together.  Since the act of composition<br/>integrates everything you know, quiet and timelessness are very important<br/>conditions for successfully carrying out this task.  You might think of the<br/>composer&apos;s one overriding leitmotif as &quot;I have never heard this before.&quot;</p><p>In this condition of contemplation you might find it helpful to determine how<br/>long of a composition you have in mind and how long you have to compose it.<br/>Answer these two questions clearly and firmly and I think you will find them both<br/>sources of inspiration.  (e.g. Handel writes Messiah in a week.  Bach turns out<br/>reams of music for his church choir every Sunday, etc. etc. etc.)</p><p>Following along in this vein you might find it helpful to determine and compose<br/>the ending now.  It&apos;s not that you have to use this ending exactly as you now<br/>contruct it, but I think you&apos;ll find that this ending (the last sound the<br/>audience will go home with) will reverberate forward throughout the composition<br/>as it takes shape. Obviously, it will have answered the basic questions of what<br/>key your music will be in as well as influence instrumentation and form.</p><p>So in my view of music composition, priorities are a bit inverted.  You might<br/>have noticed I haven&apos;t mentioned harmony or melody yet.  The next order of<br/>business is dividing up this musical construction into manageable tasks.  And so<br/>at this point you might want to consider a general form and notational scheme.<br/>The latter is well covered in this newsletter tuning@onelist.</p><p>Now I would consider writing a title.  And though this may seem a trifle,<br/>personally I think a title can be a source of inspiration.  Sometimes, for<br/>instance, a title can be stronger than the music.  Or vice versa.  Specifically<br/>I&apos;m thinking of The Firebird Suite which left me, as a kid, highly disappointed .<br/>. . and made me want to write music even more.</p><p>At this point I start to consider scale.  And there is a lot to choose from as<br/>this newsletter amply addresses.</p><p>Rhythm might be your next consideration.  And part of this phase of music<br/>composition is to determine how fast the music is going to go (i.e., tempo) and<br/>you might also consider settling on a time signature(s).  This is crucial if for<br/>no other reason than the fact that the faster the music goes, the more music you<br/>are going to have to write.</p><p>And then now you might want to really look into orchestration.  Because the music<br/>you have in mind will be different depending on what instruments or vocals you<br/>use.  Instruments have specific ranges and abilities that can actual inspire your<br/>music as it comes to fruition.  I think you might begin to see the logic of<br/>determining &quot;scale&quot; before &quot;orchestration&quot; because orchestration is a bit<br/>dependent on scale, since not all instruments may be able to play your scale.<br/>For instance a fixed keyboard instrument like a marimba may be too difficult to<br/>retune depending on the scale you employ.</p><p>Finally harmonic and melodic considerations might be in order.  At this point I<br/>begin to doodle.  And from these doodles you will find certain phrases that<br/>become important.  And from these phrases you might be able to determine possible<br/>chord formations and chord progressions.</p><p>I hope this helps.</p><p>RT<br/>Monday, March 8, 1999<br/>Los Angeles</p><p><a href="mailto:Lewis_Jimmy@hq.navsea.navy.mil">Lewis_Jimmy@hq.navsea.navy.mil</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:Lewis_Jimmy@hq.navsea.navy.mil">Lewis_Jimmy@hq.navsea.navy.mil</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could someone describe the steps (concept thru verification) a composer had to<br/>&gt; go through to produce a score before MIDI existed?<br/>&gt; I know this is an OFF TOPIC subject, but it seems many people here are<br/>&gt; composers?<br/>&gt; Lewis<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe from this mailing list, or to change your subscription<br/>&gt; to digest, go to the ONElist web site, at <a href="http://www.onelist.com">http://www.onelist.com</a> and<br/>&gt; select the Member Center link from the menu bar on the left.<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

Along a<br/>similar vein, later on, my (traditional) Theory instructor pointed out that<br/>studying Theory does not help you out in composition:  Before you take theory,<br/>you&apos;ll get to a spot in a composition, and say, &quot;I can&apos;t think what to do here&quot;.<br/>After you take Theory you&apos;ll get to that spot and you&apos;ll say, &quot;there must be a<br/>hundred things I could do here&quot;!</p><p>   So, the object of that philosophy lesson is that there&apos;s a lot of &quot;just do<br/>it!&quot; in composition.  Inspiration, confidence, creativity, and practice is a lot<br/>of what it takes to compose music.</p><p>   But there certainly are lots of corollary skills too of course.  Ear-training,<br/>or &quot;Musicianship&quot; as some college-curricula writers call it, is probably the most<br/>important.  Generally speaking, that comes down to making a strong connection in<br/>your mind between what you hear and what&apos;s happening in the music.</p><p>   The proverbial &quot;final exam&quot; after a couple years of traditional ear-training<br/>courses is to take four-part dictation, wherein the instructor plays for you a<br/>short church-hymn style composition, and your job is to write it down.  That is<br/>perhaps a bit lodged in the more or less 17th-19th-century assumption that you<br/>can&apos;t get music played without writing it down first (that is unless you play it<br/>yourself at the keyboard of course).  The skills it teaches you are exceptionally<br/>powerful though:  When you hear a certain melody in your head, you can write it<br/>down, or the reverse.  When you hear a harmonic movement in your head, you know<br/>what chords will produce that effect, and so forth.</p><p>   But more generally, having a firm connection between the sound in your head<br/>and knowledge of the notes that produce them, is what lets you translate<br/>theoretical ideas into actual music.  That then, when I start in on a new tuning<br/>system (for long-term investigation), is why about the first thing I do is come<br/>up with a set of ear-training exercises on tape.  They let me firm up that<br/>connection in the new tuning&apos;s way of doing things.</p><p>   So then what else is useful for composition?  Well, ultimately for any style<br/>of music that involves any significant degree of expressiveness, you&apos;re going to<br/>have to have some skill in performing on some instrument.  With MIDI, you can<br/>&quot;fake it&quot; so to speak, but only up to a point and you it that point pretty darned<br/>quick.</p><p>   So then what do you do when you have all of the materials and skills (and do<br/>we really ever)?  Then the answer is Ivor Darreg&apos;s:  &quot;OK then, compose!&quot;  Go for<br/>it!  Try it.  See what happens, try things out.  See what works and what<br/>doesn&apos;t.  Take notes.  Whenever a cool melody strikes you, write it down and file<br/>it away for that time in the future when you realize that the reason why this<br/>composition just isn&apos;t going anywhere is that the melody you&apos;ve chosen isn&apos;t very<br/>inspiring.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/10/1999 8:17:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Could someone describe the steps (concept thru verification) a composer had to<br/>&gt; go through to produce a score before MIDI existed?</p><p>It appears to vary between each individual. I understand that Hovhaness dreams al<br/>his pieces and for that matter Erv Wilson has stated that many of his solutions have<br/>been worked out in dreams. Wilson in my book is way ahead but even though I enjoy<br/>Hovhaness I find him not the best, so I think there is hope for those of us less<br/>blessed. This is the question I always wanted answered from other composers but<br/>never could find any comment on it. For my self, I try a couple of different<br/>methods. I recommend when you have any idea for a piece write down in any form<br/>possible all your ideas first and later work on developments and orders. Sometimes I<br/>have to figure out all the possibilities of answers to a problem and go through them<br/>one by one. This is very time consuming but experience enables one to narrow down<br/>the field allot quicker.<br/>Lou Harrisons  MUSIC PRIMER IS THE BEST BOOK BECAUSE OF IT ATTITUDE.

People remember the end the most, so I often practice it<br/>the most.  It seems odd at first.</p><p>   But getting back to composition, I am often surprised by the variety of<br/>motivations or inspirations I have for various compositions.  In some cases, it&apos;s<br/>some great melody that just hits me, and I want to do something with it.  For me<br/>at least, a harmony concept is rarely what lights the sparc.  A formal concept<br/>often does provide an impetus for me to compose.  Sometimes a tuning system alone,<br/>or more often a new approach to a tuning system (e.g., a new subset mode, or a<br/>new way of using a tuning, like serialism) provides an impetus to compose.  In<br/>one case, and this particular composition is barely even begun, a spacial idea<br/>inspires me to compose.</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/1999 8:04:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I agree with Gary Morrison&apos;s advice about not trying to make a masterpiece<br/>but it&apos;s important to stress the caveat that not everything you compose is<br/>ready for an audience.
