Many &#x9;proper P may satisfy this<br/>requirement.  If the stimuli are &#x9;sufficiently unfamiliar (as when one<br/>listens to music of an alien &#x9;culture) many repeated hearings may be<br/>necessary during which a &#x9;listener replaces a familiar P with one more<br/>appropriate for &#x9;classifying the stimuli heard.  The cardinality of the<br/>constructed &#x9;P will depend upon the numbers of distinctions required by the<br/>&#x9;particular musical language or, if the stimuli are not musical, &#x9;upon the<br/>fineness of discrimination required by the recognition &#x9;task to be performed.</p><p>Once an appropriate P has been found, the next step is to locate a stimulus<br/>within it...</p><p>&#x9;Given any &quot;interval&quot; (pair) in P, the listener is able to &#x9;recognize the<br/>possible positions its elements might occupy in P.  &#x9;In effect, given any<br/>pair of elements he can mentally supply &#x9;(interpolate) a possible set of<br/>remaining elements of P which &#x9;satisfy the equivalence class and tuning he<br/>has learned.  Such an &#x9;interpolation becomes unique after a sufficient<br/>number of elements &#x9;of P are heard.  This is equivalent to the<br/>identification of x &#x9;(key) in a give P(x).</p><p>&#x9;For example, the major triad [C E G] is not a sufficient subset of &#x9;the<br/>C-major scale since there are two other major scales (namely G &#x9;and F) in<br/>which it occurs.  But C-major is the only major scale &#x9;which contains the<br/>four notes [G B D F], so the &quot;dominant seventh &#x9;chord&quot; is a sufficient<br/>subset of C-major.  A minimal set is a &#x9;sufficient set&#x9;with no sufficient<br/>subsets.  Thus, [G B D F] is &#x9;not a minimal set, but [G B F] is, as there<br/>is no major scale &#x9;except C which contains [G B F], while each of its<br/>proper subsets &#x9;[G B] [G F] [B F] are included in some other major scale<br/>(G, F, &#x9;and F# respectively).</p><p>&#x9;It is straightforward to verify that sufficient (and therefore &#x9;minimal)<br/>sets are invariants of equivalence.  They depend only on &#x9;the equivalence<br/>class, not on the particular tuning.</p><p>A measure is developed for this locating...</p><p>&#x9;Consider a language whose alphabet consists of n letters (or &#x9;phonemes).<br/>How many distinct words can be formed using this &#x9;alphabet?  Certain<br/>restrictions may exist which can limit the<br/>&#x9;sequences of letters that can occur.  The more distinct words that &#x9;can be<br/>formed whose length is less than or equal to some maximal &#x9;value, the more<br/>efficient the alphabet is said to be.</p><p>&#x9;A similar situation applies when &quot;words&quot; are formed from sequences &#x9;of<br/>intervals.  Since interval sequences are formed from tone &#x9;sequences, we<br/>consider sequences of the elements of some P.  Also, &#x9;since no new<br/>intervals are formed when an element is repeated, &#x9;only non-repeating<br/>sequences will be considered.  Since we are &#x9;here concerned only with<br/>properties deriving from the structure of &#x9;P, we will use the following<br/>criterion for the termination of a &#x9;&quot;word&quot; (other criteria apply when<br/>&quot;motifs&quot; are considered): When &#x9;all remaining elements of P are determined<br/>by a sequence of some &#x9;of its elements, the addition of elements will<br/>impart no further &#x9;information of this type, and the &quot;word&quot; will be<br/>considered &#x9;terminated.  That is, any sequence will be considered complete<br/>as &#x9;soon as a sufficient set occurs in it.</p><p>&#x9;We now ask, given a particular equivalence class, how many &#x9;distinct words<br/>can be formed using k elements where k varies from &#x9;1 to n.  Consider all<br/>non-repeating sequences of n points (there &#x9;are n! such sequences).  Let<br/>S_i be the number of elements in each &#x9;such sequence which must appear<br/>before a sufficient set is &#x9;encountered.  The F(P) is defined as the average,</p><p>&#x9;n!<br/>&#x9;Sigma(S_i) / n!<br/>&#x9;i=1</p><p>&#x9;F(P) may be interpreted as the average number of elements in a non-<br/>repeating sequence of n elements of P(x) required to determine the &#x9;key, x.<br/> Efficiency, E, is defined as F(P)/n and Redundancy, R, as &#x9;1 - F(P)/n.<br/>Both numbers lie between 0 and 1.</p><p>&#x9;It should be noted that this kind of efficiency and redundancy &#x9;differs<br/>from the meanings these terms assume in information &#x9;theory.  The<br/>distinction is important and applies to alphabets in &#x9;spoken natural<br/>languages as well as to musical scales.  The &#x9;redundancy of information<br/>theory refers to a redundancy in the &#x9;message, not in the code.  In our<br/>discussion here, that property &#x9;of the code which determines whether<br/>efficient messages _can_ be &#x9;constructed (if such are desired) is<br/>considered.  This property is &#x9;inherent in the code itself, and does not<br/>apply to the message.</p><p>Rothenberg outlines six scenarios...</p><p>&#x9;  Scale type  Stability    Efficiency<br/>&#x9;(a)  proper       high         high<br/>&#x9;(b)  proper       high         low<br/>&#x9;(c)  proper       low          high<br/>&#x9;(d)  proper       low          low<br/>&#x9;(e)  improper     ----         high<br/>&#x9;(f)  improper     ----         low</p><p>And discusses them...</p><p>&#x9;Notice that in Figure 1, all scales in 12tET with which we are &#x9;most<br/>familiar (the major, minor, and Chinese pentatonic) conform &#x9;to situation<br/>(a).  In fact, the major scale (of which the &#x9;&quot;natural&quot; minor is a mode) is<br/>far higher in both stability and &#x9;efficiency than any other 7-tone scale.<br/>Next among 7-tone scales &#x9;is the &quot;melodic&quot; minor (2,2,2,2,1,2,1).  The<br/>Chinese pentatonic &#x9;stands out among scales of 5 and 6 tones.</p><p>&#x9;However, situation (b) applies to many scales with which we are &#x9;familiar,<br/>such as the &quot;whole-tone&quot; and &quot;12-tone&quot; scales.  Note &#x9;that while these are<br/>strictly proper scales, from the hearing of a &#x9;sufficient set (any element)<br/>alone, it is not possible to code the &#x9;elements of P into scale degrees.<br/>That is, although PxP is coded &#x9;by the proper mapping, there is no way to<br/>index elements of P &#x9;except by arbitrary choice.  __Thus, since in these<br/>cases &#x9;intervals are coded but tones are not, composition with these<br/>scales must involve relations which make use of motivic &#x9;similarities<br/>rather than relations between scale degrees.__  Hence &#x9;the tone row basis<br/>of 12-tone music (which is essentially motivic &#x9;in concept) is not<br/>surprising.  An examination of Debussy&apos;s whole-&#x9;tone piano prelude &quot;Violes&quot;<br/>show similar motivic dependency.</p><p>&#x9;Now consider improper scales.  PxP is not coded except by the &#x9;employment<br/>of proper subsets or a fixed tonic.  __Hence &#x9;information is primarily<br/>communicated by the scale degrees.__  &#x9;Thus it is important that P be coded<br/>as quickly as possible, which &#x9;is indicated by a high redundancy (low<br/>efficiency) as in case &#x9;(f).  It would be expected that scales<br/>characterized by case (e) &#x9;would be extremely difficult to use, except when<br/>the tonic is &#x9;fixed by a drone or similar device and, in fact, we have not<br/>discovered such scales in any musical culture examined thus far.  &#x9;In<br/>general, the use of motivic sequences on different scale &#x9;degrees of<br/>improper scales would not be expected (except within &#x9;proper subsets of<br/>such scales), and this is strongly supported by &#x9;examination of Indian and<br/>other music using improper scales.</p><p>&#x9;We would also expect that proper scales characterized by low &#x9;stability<br/>would tend to be used as improper scales, so that case &#x9;(c) would resemble<br/>case (e), and (d) resemble (f), and similar &#x9;remarks apply.</p><p>Makes cross-cultural observations...</p><p>&#x9;In Java there exist two scale systems, &quot;Slendro&quot; and &quot;Pelog&quot;, each<br/>containing a variety of scales.  It has been observed that all &#x9;scales in<br/>the &quot;Slendro&quot; class are strictly proper and that all in &#x9;the &quot;Pelog&quot; class<br/>are improper.  In a study conducted with the &#x9;assistance of Mr. Surya Brata<br/>of the Ministry of Education and &#x9;Culture, Jakarta, the uses of these scale<br/>systems were observed to &#x9;be in accord with the predictions of this model.</p><p>References to the Javanese study...</p><p>&#x9;Kunst, J.
