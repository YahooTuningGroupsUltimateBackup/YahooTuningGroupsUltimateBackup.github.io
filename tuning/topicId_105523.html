I&apos;ll admit I don&apos;t have particularly great level of intelligence nor a long attention span for active working but I still think I may be lacking something else that others on this forum have but I don&apos;t know what that is.</p><p>Obviously, one problem I face is the issue of notation and nomenclature; if I am going to use some pitches I need some names for them! So I came up with this idea over the past week: instead of using the letters A B C D E F G ~~ I want to make it usable in other alphabets! Knowing that the Roman alphabet has direct correspondences with the Greek, Hebrew, Arabic and Phoenician alphabets I imagined twenty-two notes within an interval of {1:2} in a chain of {2:3} and {3:4} intervals and assigned one letter of the Phoenician alphabet to each note. Here is the result, with numbers corresponding roughly to 53rd part of a {1:2} interval, Phoenician letter name and Greek letter name:<br/>(+11) 23 Tau - Tau/Tav/Taw - Tau<br/>(+10) 45 Sin/Shin - Sin/Shin - Sigma<br/>(+9) 14 Re - Resh - Rho<br/>(+8) 36 Qof - Qoph - (Qoppa)<br/>(+7) 05 Sah/San - Sade - (San)<br/>(+6) 27 Pe - Pe - Pi<br/>(+5) 49 Ain - Ain - Omicron<br/>(+4) 18 Sem/Sen - Samekh/Semkath - Xi<br/>(+3) 40 Nun - Nun - Nu<br/>(+2) 09 Mem/Mim - Mem/Mim - Mu<br/>(+1) 31 Lam - Lamedh - Lambda<br/>(00) 00 Kaf - Kaph - Kappa<br/>(-1) 22 Yod - Yodh - Iota<br/>(-2) 44 Tet - Teth - Theta<br/>(-3) 13 Het - Heth - Eta<br/>(-4) 35 Zain - Zain - Zeta<br/>(-5) 04 Waw - Waw - (Digamma)/Upsilon<br/>(-6) 26 He - He - E(psilon)<br/>(-7) 48 Dal/Del - Daleth - Delta<br/>(-8) 17 Gam - Gamel/Gimel - Gamma<br/>(-9) 39 Bet - Beth - Beta<br/>(-10) 08 Al - Aleph - Alpha<br/>((NOTE: Spellings of these letters&apos; names in Roman letters may vary because *no* Romanization is *perfect*.))</p><p>Now, let&apos;s arrange these in order of increasing frequency of vibration, starting on &apos;Kaf&apos; :<br/>00-00 Kaf<br/>04-05 Waw-San<br/>08-09 Al-Mim<br/>13-14 Het-Re<br/>17-18 Gam-Sem<br/>22-23 Yod-Tau<br/>26-27 He-Pe<br/>31-31 Lam<br/>35-36 Zain-Qof<br/>39-40 Bet-Nun<br/>44-45 Tet-Shin<br/>48-49 Dal-Ain<br/>53-53 Kaf</p><p>See how &apos;Kaf&apos; and &apos;Lam&apos; are isolate while the others come in pairs that differ by a small interval? Twelve iterations of {2:3, 3:4} kept in the frame of {1:2} lead to two pitches that sound very much alike yet are different; it&apos;s like two posts are set near but there is no closure. In other words, it&apos;s a *schism* , a split, a division! Is there a special name for this particular schism? I tried to think of one but I can&apos;t seem to come up with a coherent and etymologically plausible name!</p><p>I wanted this sort of thing to be adaptable to different tunings so if there aren&apos;t more than twenty-two tones to a frame of {1:2} then this idea shouldn&apos;t pose difficulties. For example, if a pentatonic scale is the basis of a system then I can use e.g. Sen@-Kaf-Lam-Mim-Nun-Sen-Kaf# for five nominals and symbols for altered pitches, which in this case @ denotes a raised pitch and # denotes a lowered pitch.</p><p>Of course, the basis of this notation only has fractions and rations with factors of {2} and {3} , what can we do about {5} ? There&apos;s another schism that is much smaller than the first schism mentioned here, it&apos;s the difference between eight iterations of {2:3, 3:4} in {1:2} and one of {4:5, 5:8}. This is represented by, e.g. Kaf-Gam which has 17 steps of 53 as shown in the above tables. 17/53{1:2} is very close to {4:5}, within one part in 850 of a {1:2} interval! Very close indeed! This schism is so small that it can practically be ignored, though of course it doesn&apos;t have to be ignored.</p><p>Sorry if this post is difficult to understand, I&apos;m still fairly new to this sort of thing and I am well aware that I may come across as being  obsessed with reading textbooks but if you have questions about anything I wrote here don&apos;t hesitate to ask! I wrote this assuming that most of the members here know what fractions and rations of frequencies are, though the way I write them may cause a little discomfort for some readers; if that is the case, please let me know!</p><p>~~ Glacia the Frosty Musician ~~</p><p>&lt;&lt; P.S.

Similarly for Pythagorean comma which if you don&apos;t like I can only suggest to abbreviate to PC :-)  You may have noticed from Mike&apos;s post that the usual name for intervals around this size is &quot;commas&quot;; e.g. also the syntonic comma (SC!) of 81/80.  In fact the schisma is the ratio PC/SC (I think).</p><p>Now, your system has 22 notes, right? And Kaf and Lam sit in splendid isolation, each with no near neighbour, whereas all the others come in pairs?  This is I believe identical (or near identical) to the Indian or &quot;sruti&quot; system, although descriptions of that vary.  I can say more if you wish, or you may prefer to look it up yourself.</p><p>One more suggestion below; I hope it will help.</p><p>&gt; ... decatonic scale that I like to use, I do something like this:<br/>&gt; Kaf-Lam-Mim-Nun-Sen<br/>&gt; Pe -San-Qof-Rei-Sin<br/>&gt; ... Kaf-San-Mim-Rei-Sen--Pe -Lam-Qof-Nun-Sin--Kaf<br/>&gt; with semitone (around {15:16}) steps in Kaf-San-Mim-Rei-Sen and Pe -Lam-Qof-Nun-Sin and small tone (around {9:10}) steps Sen--Pe and Sin--Kaf. Does that make sense?</p><p>Yes; actually Kaf-San is 512:729 (approx 5\53) while San-Mim is 2048:2187 (approx 4/53); the latter differs from 15:16 by the schisma (I think).  Similarly Sen--Pe is 9\53 and Sin--Kaf is 8\53 - I&apos;ve not worked out the actual ratios - one is approx 9:10 but the latter is approx 8:9 (and what is the ratio of these two? this question has didactic intent - I can&apos;t help it; although not a teacher myself, my parents both are).</p><p>While I&apos;m at it, you have not mentioned that Kaf-Sen is around 4:5 - any reason for that?</p><p>You could diagram this as follows (use Courier font to view):</p><p>   Pe  - San - Qof - Rei - Sin<br/>   / \   / \   / \   / \  /<br/>Kaf - Lam - Mim - Nun - Sen</p><p>or, for anyone else who&apos;s reading :-)</p><p>   F#  - C#  - G#  - D#  - A#<br/>   / \   / \   / \   / \  /<br/> C  -  G  -  D  -  A  -  E</p><p>where:<br/>* the &quot;-&quot; interval is 2:3 (approx 31\53)<br/>* the &quot;/&quot; interval is 512:729 (approx 27\53)<br/>* the &quot;\&quot; interval is 243:256 (approx 4\53)</p><p>I find this kind of thing useful because parallel moves are identical in size; where such a move is not available, you know you have to use a different interval (it may or may not be close).</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve also known of an heptatonic scale with six small steps around 3/22{1:2} and one long step around 4/22{1:2} so it has three separate &quot;chains&quot; of {3}|{2} e.g. Kaf-Lam-Mim, Shin-Tau and Bet-Gam so the scale runs Kaf--Mim-Gam-Tau-Lam-Bet-Sin-Kaf with Kaf:Gam:Tau:Lam an approximate 8:10:11:12 and Kaf:Mim an approximate 7:8 ; I think it&apos;s useful so long as there aren&apos;t more than a few &quot;chains&quot; of {3}|{2} in the scale!</p><p>I don&apos;t understand the 3\22 and 4\22 - (a) why change from expressing as x\53?

We can equate Kaf=C, Lam=G and would find that Al=Ebb at one end of the chain and Tau=E# at the other.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Common practice notation is limited to seven nominals and the Roman alphabet; I wanted to use up to 22 nominals and be adaptable to other alphabets ~~ and besides, having at least twelve notes on a chain of {1:3}|{2} is desirable because the scale from a twelve-tone chain (sLsLssLsLsLs) has near-equal steps while the seven-tone scale (LLsLLsL) has a three step interval (LLL {512:729}) longer than a four step interval (sLLs {729:1024}) ; to see that the first is longer, multiply 729/512 by 729/1024 then check the result :P</p><p>&gt; &gt; Or a &quot;tiny schisma&quot; as I would like to call it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t try to change that name which has a much longer history than anyone on this list!  Similarly for Pythagorean comma which if you don&apos;t like I can only suggest to abbreviate to PC :-)  You may have noticed from Mike&apos;s post that the usual name for intervals around this size is &quot;commas&quot;; e.g. also the syntonic comma (SC!) of 81/80.  In fact the schisma is the ratio PC/SC (I think).<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;ve known about the syntonic comma being tempered to an identity in much of Western common practice music, called &quot;Meantone&quot; though I haven&apos;t used meantone tunings much when I try to compose new music :P</p><p>&gt; Now, your system has 22 notes, right? And Kaf and Lam sit in splendid isolation, each with no near neighbour, whereas all the others come in pairs?  This is I believe identical (or near identical) to the Indian or &quot;sruti&quot; system, although descriptions of that vary.  I can say more if you wish, or you may prefer to look it up yourself.<br/>&gt;</p><p>It can have any subset of the 22 nominals; the main idea here is that two notes of a scale separate by {1:3}|{2} (includes {2:3, 3:4, 3:8} etc. but not {4:5, 4:9} etc.) have nominals on adjacent positions on a 22 letter alphabet though the converse need not hold true, which it won&apos;t if a 22 tone scale has more than one chain of {1:3}|{2} intervals. I suppose it can be used for the &quot;sruti&quot; system in some way though the nomenclature may sound rather strange to mainstream Hindustani and Carnatic practitioners</p><p>&gt; One more suggestion below; I hope it will help.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... decatonic scale that I like to use, I do something like this:<br/>&gt; &gt; Kaf-Lam-Mim-Nun-Sen<br/>&gt; &gt; Pe -San-Qof-Rei-Sin<br/>&gt; &gt; ... Kaf-San-Mim-Rei-Sen--Pe -Lam-Qof-Nun-Sin--Kaf<br/>&gt; &gt; with semitone (around {15:16}) steps in Kaf-San-Mim-Rei-Sen and Pe -Lam-Qof-Nun-Sin and small tone (around {9:10}) steps Sen--Pe and Sin--Kaf. Does that make sense?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes; actually Kaf-San is 512:729 (approx 5\53) while San-Mim is 2048:2187 (approx 4/53); the latter differs from 15:16 by the schisma (I think).  Similarly Sen--Pe is 9\53 and Sin--Kaf is 8\53 - I&apos;ve not worked out the actual ratios - one is approx 9:10 but the latter is approx 8:9 (and what is the ratio of these two? this question has didactic intent - I can&apos;t help it; although not a teacher myself, my parents both are).<br/>&gt;</p><p>{512:729} is near 5/53{1:2} ? It&apos;s more like 27/53{1:2} !!</p><p>The way I use that particular decatonic scale, Sen--Pe and Sin--Kaf are tempered {9:10} and the eight small steps are tempered {15:16} such that two small steps are a tempered {8:9} such as Kaf--Mim and San--Rei. The idea of successive nominals e.g. Kaf-Lam, Lam-Mim etc. separate by {2:3} holds; what the other intervals are depends on in the interpretation of the scale.</p><p>&gt; While I&apos;m at it, you have not mentioned that Kaf-Sen is around 4:5 - any reason for that?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Kaf-Sen represents an interval near 18/53{1:2} ; this can be {4:5} in a meantone system but usually, as in the decatonic scale described above, does not represent {4:5}. Kaf-Gam is more often {4:5} than Kaf-Sen but that does not need to hold true either!</p><p>&gt; You could diagram this as follows (use Courier font to view):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Pe  - San - Qof - Rei - Sin<br/>&gt;    / \   / \   / \   / \  /<br/>&gt; Kaf - Lam - Mim - Nun - Sen<br/>&gt;<br/>((Note: Try putting filler characters, e.g. full stops &quot;...&quot; before the first character of the line and in multiple spaces so that in normal view it looks more clear))</p><p>&gt; or, for anyone else who&apos;s reading :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    F#  - C#  - G#  - D#  - A#<br/>&gt;    / \   / \   / \   / \  /<br/>&gt;  C  -  G  -  D  -  A  -  E<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where:<br/>&gt; * the &quot;-&quot; interval is 2:3 (approx 31\53)<br/>&gt; * the &quot;/&quot; interval is 512:729 (approx 27\53)<br/>&gt; * the &quot;\&quot; interval is 243:256 (approx 4\53)<br/>&gt;</p><p>I normally would use the &quot;/&quot; interval to represent {32:45} and {45:64} simultaneously, and &quot;\&quot; to represent {15:16} which infact does *not* represent {243:256} for this particular scale; rather, {243:256} is equal with {24:25} here and can be notated with extra symbols.</p><p>&gt; I find this kind of thing useful because parallel moves are identical in size; where such a move is not available, you know you have to use a different interval (it may or may not be close).<br/>&gt;</p><p>That&apos;s a neat way to think about that ^_^</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve also known of an heptatonic scale with six small steps around 3/22{1:2} and one long step around 4/22{1:2} so it has three separate &quot;chains&quot; of {3}|{2} e.g. Kaf-Lam-Mim, Shin-Tau and Bet-Gam so the scale runs Kaf--Mim-Gam-Tau-Lam-Bet-Sin-Kaf with Kaf:Gam:Tau:Lam an approximate 8:10:11:12 and Kaf:Mim an approximate 7:8 ; I think it&apos;s useful so long as there aren&apos;t more than a few &quot;chains&quot; of {3}|{2} in the scale!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand the 3\22 and 4\22 - (a) why change from expressing as x\53? (b) if you mean to count steps within the ordered 22 they are not equal in size (a confusion often seen in the context of Indian sruti) so this doesn&apos;t seem useful.  In fact the steps in the scale seem to me to be 9, 8, 6, 8, 8, 6, 8.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The &quot;x\53&quot; values given in the second table of my first post are merely guidelines on what names to use for each interval; notes in the gaps of 3 or 4 steps of 53 can be named by either side of the gap. I intended this to be adaptable to various tunings and temperament systems so it can be used for any sort of scale with plenty of {1:3}|{2} and no more than 22 notes. So this heptatonic scale from Kaf has steps [4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]/22/{1:2} ; for example, Mim-Gam has 8 steps of 53 in the original table which is near {9:10} and the small step of this scale is {9:10} tempered narrow so it fits here~~</p><p>&gt; Note, I am not saying the scale is bad; I don&apos;t know (it looks highly original to me).  I like the description of an approximate 8:10:11:12 - that&apos;s exactly the kind of thing people do around here (the only question would be, how good does it sound).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Again you could use a diagram:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             Bet - Gam<br/>&gt;             / \   /<br/>&gt;    Kaf - Lam - Mim<br/>&gt;    / \   /<br/>&gt; Sin - Tau<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; or,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;             Bbb - Fb<br/>&gt;             / \   /<br/>&gt;     C  -  G  -  D<br/>&gt;    / \   /<br/>&gt;  A# -  E#<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; where now:<br/>&gt; * the &quot;-&quot; interval is &quot;31\53&quot;<br/>&gt; * the &quot;/&quot; interval is &quot;8\53&quot;<br/>&gt; * the &quot;\&quot; interval is &quot;23\53&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A final question; you wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... which in this case @ denotes a raised pitch and # denotes a lowered pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By how much would the pitch be raised?<br/>&gt;</p><p>In the pentatonic scale with alterations Sen@-Kaf-Lam-Mim-Nun-Sen-Kaf# the alteration is a (tempered) {243:256} ; the decatonic scale described above is basically two pentatonic scales separate by 1/2{1:2} where {24:25} and {243:256} are equal.
