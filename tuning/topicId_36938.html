Why others profess this difficulty, I don&apos;t<br/>understand.  There is nothing supernatural about it.  Biases and prejudices<br/>aside, if you can play strict 12-tET, you can learn to play a quartertone<br/>with very little effort.  Tristan&apos;s comment sounds to me similar to a<br/>musician claiming that he or she has enough trouble playing in 12-tET without<br/>messing around with microtones!</p><p>I have been teaching quartertones to all my New York University students for<br/>years now.  They learn it easily, and they progress more rapidly this way<br/>than any other.</p><p>Three Reasons To Learn Microtones on Woodwinds (&amp; other instruments)<br/>1.  More pitch acuity and expertise for all intervals, especially<br/>conventional ones<br/>2.  Greater hands/fingering flexibility, with the equivalent of calisthenics<br/>combined with Tai Chi like control and energy and grace, and<br/>3. Richer tone and maturity of tone as a result of integrating the whole of<br/>the instruments timbre and expressivity into a totality that can lean<br/>brighter and darker as desired.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
