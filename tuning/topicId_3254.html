I seem to define things<br/>differently than more than a few of you listers and my cheesy sense of<br/>humour rubs a few the wrong way, for the humour I cannot apologize but<br/>for the defining I can only begin to try to explain. So in an attempt to<br/>clarify my positions and to remove further obstacles from communicating<br/>vital ideas regarding tuning I shall start a series of posts entitled<br/>&quot;Definitions and Confusion&quot;, so when you see them you can either delete<br/>then straight away or have a laugh and maybe understand some of my<br/>&quot;extreme&quot; views.They wil contain relevant qoutes which I apply directly<br/>or semi-directly to my conception of Tuning.  So without further ado..<br/>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p><p>Definitions and Confusion for Tuning list Spring<br/>1999                       Numero Uno                             Credo<br/>quia  absurdum<br/>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p><p>PRIME     NUMBER   ONE<br/>excerpted from &quot;Rhythm of Wholness&quot;   by Mr. Dane Rudhyar</p><p>   &quot; The basic and original meaning of the word one does indeed refer to<br/>the first (prime) numeral ,number one. But number<br/>one is not merely the first of an infinite series of numbers; all<br/>numbers are produced by the addition of one to itself. Therefore<br/>in the abstract sense, one can be considered the principle of<br/>numeration. It generates all numbers, which can be considered<br/>differentiated aspects of it. but if one generates all numbers, such a<br/>process is obviously some kind of self multiplication. The tendency<br/>inherent in number one to generate all numbers, seemingly ad infinitum,<br/>clearly shows that unity and multiplicity are both inherent in number<br/>one. Thus we are faced with the paradox that the one is a &quot;whole&quot;<br/>Nevertheless, the human mind cannot conceive of absolute &quot;one-ness,&quot;<br/>because any conception by a mind implies that one already has a second,<br/>indeed a multiplicity of potential seconds. Therefore, the Meta musician<br/>has to infer two levels of &quot;one-ness&quot;- an absolute level at which one is<br/>not even a principle of numeration, and a level at which, as such a<br/>principle, it  contains all numbers in potentiality.&quot;</p><p>111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111</p></div><h3>Antriasian@xxx.xxx</h3><span>5/31/1999 12:54:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>does anybody know peter hoejke&apos;s e&apos;mail adress?? hees the gguy who made a<br/>splended spreadsheet for finding the positions of flute holes.</p><p>thanks..  <a href="mailto:antriasian@aol.com">antriasian@aol.com</a></p></div>
