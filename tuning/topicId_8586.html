I just suddenly realized I can no longer compose a<br/>&gt; piece in 12-tET...  Thanks a lot.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I tried.  After 10+ plus hours of written music, much of it published, it<br/>&gt; is now of no avail.  The piece I just started, determined to be in 12-tET<br/>&gt; is now also microtonal...  Anything else now seems &quot;simplistic.&quot;<br/>&gt; Help.  I am halfway up a mountain and there is no turning back... Jerry<br/>&gt; Eskelin is right...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Help... I need somebody.... [I guess that&apos;s ripe for &quot;high 3rd&quot;<br/>&gt; analysis...]<br/>&gt;<br/>ROTFLMAO! That&apos;s the funniest thing I&apos;ve heard in a while, Joe. You<br/>certainly know how to make someone&apos;s day.</p><p>Pardon the personal reference, but your post reminds me of my singers who<br/>used to come back to rehearsals after the holidays bitching about having to<br/>sing caroling gigs with professional singers who had no concept of &quot;locked<br/>in&quot; tuning. One singer suggested I publish a disclaimer to new auditionees<br/>that singing with the LA Jazz Choir will tend to make them dissatisfied with<br/>most other choral experiences. (Whether or not that was true, it was nice to<br/>hear.)</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
