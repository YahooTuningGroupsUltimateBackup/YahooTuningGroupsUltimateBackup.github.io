I tried DirectMusic and<br/>Noteworthy Composer right now just to make sure.</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2004 12:49:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Monz,</p><p>Yes, it depends on the soundcard or device. As far as<br/>Windows is concerned, it relays Legato messages in the<br/>same way that it relays any other controllers.</p><p>The only distinction in windows Midi relaying is between<br/>the normal short messages, and longer sysexes or<br/>a buffer of many time stamped note ons sent in advance<br/>in one go (which you can do in Windows Midi relaying).<br/>The longer messages may be sent asynchronously<br/>and so get out of sync with the short ones and<br/>whether they do or not depends on the particular<br/>driver.</p><p>But you can add a soft synth with legato if your soundcard<br/>doesn&apos;t have it.</p><p>The Yamaha soft synth supports Legato.</p><p>Usually you use it with it set to Monomode as well<br/>so you have just the one monophonic line.</p><p>Controller 126 switches Monomode on and controller<br/>127 sets the channel back to normal polyphony.<br/>The data for these two controllers is ignored.</p><p>Then you should be able to play monophonic trills<br/>- hold down one note and with it held down hold<br/>down a second note repeatedly to trill to it in<br/>a wind player type trill.</p><p>One might expect the Legato controller to<br/>smooth out the attack on the note as well -<br/>but it doesn&apos;t have to do that. It may but<br/>the defining characteristic seems to be these<br/>Legato trills.</p><p>If it doesn&apos;t smooth out the attack,<br/>try setting Portamento on with a slide time of 0,<br/>which may or may not work.</p><p>That works with the Yamaha soft synth:<br/>Monomode + Legato + Portamento with slide<br/>time of 0. The portamento setting just<br/>removes the attack without adding any<br/>sliding to thepitch.</p><p>With the Roland Virtual Sound canvas<br/>then again you have these monomode legato<br/>trills with attack, but portameto doesn&apos;t<br/>do anything about the attack unless<br/>you set quite high with pitches sliding<br/>about.</p><p>You can make monophonic legato trills in any<br/>tuning if you apply appropriate pitch bends<br/>before each note as you play.</p><p>FTS has an option to add those pitch bends<br/>in automatically - it&apos;s innovative<br/>monophonic legato retuning feature.<br/>I don&apos;t know of any other software that<br/>has this feature.</p><p>It is in Parts | More | Portamento<br/>and Legato | Auto retune for<br/>monophonic trills, which you need<br/>to use with Monomode + Legato.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
