So the difference tones actually form &quot;difference tone harmonic series&quot;.  Any comments on this odd occurrence?</p><p>  I also noticed that making a scale of ONLY notes in the<br/>&quot;difference-tone harmonic series&quot; IE 18/17,9/8,19/15,10/7,20/13...creates a much more consonant scale.<br/>*********************************************************</p><p>   Still I&apos;m ITCHING to find a way to slip more notes into the scale and get advice.  Particularly on the below issues/problems with my scale:</p><p>A) The 4/3 is probably the worst sounding interval in this scale so any ideas for changing it would be appreciated.<br/>B) I found myself having to drop one note from my old &quot;rational PHI&quot; scale to make this work smoothly: that note was around the PHI tuning value 1.46808.  Do any of you all have ideas what rational fractions would work well within this scale that evaluate to about 1.46808?</p></div>
