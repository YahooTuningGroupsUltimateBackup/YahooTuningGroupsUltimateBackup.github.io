As soon as you hit a<br/>quartertone LOW symbol, one is thrown into a different scale, where<br/>the numbers are different to get it to work right.  One actually has<br/>to *add* higher numbers to get a *SMALLER* microtone with the<br/>quartertone LOW symbols.</p><p>Trust me.  I&apos;ve been obsessing about this all evening.</p><p>THE SOLUTION???</p><p>Well, fortunately there *is* one!</p><p>The solution is to use ONLY quartertone high symbols for the plug-in.</p><p>Then you can change the pitch bend numbers with impunity and they<br/>always come out right.</p><p>Just *one* quartertone LOW symbol and it totally changes the scale!</p><p>(And by &quot;scale&quot; of course, I mean &quot;pitch bend&quot; numbers!)</p><p>If one stays with only the quartertone HIGH symbols, it works like<br/>the manual says it should, which would be the following:</p><p>normal = B0,64</p><p>On the raising side:</p><p>^ = B0,69.5<br/>&gt; = B0,74.6<br/>] = B0,80</p><p>And, on the lowering side:</p><p>v = B0,58.7<br/>&lt; = B0,53.4<br/>[ = B0,48</p><p>Now that will work *perfectly* as long as you don&apos;t sneak a<br/>quartertone LOW accidental in there someplace.  Then the scale<br/>changes.</p><p>And, you can&apos;t add the quartertone low symbol in later, or it ADDS<br/>the quartertone lowering to the pitch, since the quartertones are<br/>brought in so integral to the system.</p><p>Since there are so many problems with these &quot;scales&quot; when trying to<br/>use more than &quot;just quartertones&quot; which, by the way, would be<br/>*exceedingly* easy to do in Sibelius (but who, in our extended circle<br/>of crazies would want to do *just* that...) I&apos;ve decided that it<br/>really *is* best to put ALL the microtonal accidentals in as TEXT<br/>items.</p><p>So, that means that, basically, I&apos;ll be using the Sims SIM-bols,<br/>after all!</p><p>And, probably that&apos;s for the best, since some players are used to<br/>them in this system.</p><p>Oh... one further comment is that, if one wishes to use these<br/>microtones with SHARPS and FLATS, one puts them in LATER.  The pitch<br/>bend is added to the sharping and flatting, so it works perfectly.</p><p>Just so long as both quartertone sharps and quartertone flats are NOT<br/>used.</p><p>Great, if that&apos;s all you&apos;re doing, but for anything more complex..</p><p>BEWARE!!!!</p><p>jp</p></div><h3>alternativetuning &#x3C;alternativetuning@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2002 8:11:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Finale is definitely harder to use than Sibelius, but Finale&apos;s<br/>flexibility (with both built-in options and third-party plug-ins,<br/>esp. those from Tobias Giesen) makes it (IMHO) the more powerful<br/>program. There was a contest last year on an engraving list among<br/>several notation programs, and despite being rigged against Finale<br/>and some other serious problems, the contest was won hands down by a<br/>Finale user. Let&apos;s hope this contest gets repeated in some form where<br/>the abilities of the individual engravers are more balanced.</p><p>There are two curent methods of getting microtones in Finale.</p><p>The first, requiring a sythesizer with a preset full keyboard<br/>retuning,  uses the &quot;KeyMap&quot; option &iacute;n the &quot;non-standard key<br/>signatures&quot; menu within the key signature tool. This works really<br/>well for 19-equal, 31-equal, 53-equal etc, anytime sharps and<br/>flats&apos;ll have fixed step values.</p><p>The 2nd option is to put in pitch bends for each note, attached<br/>as &quot;note expressions&quot;. The bad news is that pitch bends are<br/>associated with channels, so polyphonic music has got to be carefully<br/>managed to deal with this limitation, and that pitchbends are<br/>notorious for latency problems, and every sythesizer or soundcard<br/>seems to have a different implement of the midi pitch bend<br/>instruction.  The good news is that Finale&apos;s pitch bend message uses<br/>more units than Sibelius, with tone at rest = 0, and allowing bend<br/>messages from -8192 to 8191. Other synths or soundcards may react<br/>differently, but on my generic soundblaster knock-off soundcard, 8191<br/>will raise a note by 200 cents. That means 4096 parts to the<br/>semitone, 2048 to the quartertone.  It sounds like my card is picking<br/>up messages of at least 4 units. So, for me, Finale is more accurate<br/>than Sibelius by about 8-to-1.</p><p>Misc.: If you don&apos;t care about attaching a symbol to the pitchbend<br/>playback message, you can also use the &quot;Edit Continuous Data&quot; menu in<br/>the Midi Tool. Here is a graphic editor for the pitch bend message.<br/>Also, the third-party &quot;TGTools&quot; includes an excellent tool for gliss<br/>playback.</p><p>That&apos;s my Finale vs. Sibelius rap.  If I didn&apos;t give a hoot about<br/>midi playback, I would probably go to Graphire, which is purely<br/>graphics, and now priced to compete with Sib. and Fin... but that&apos;s<br/>another story, and would mean having to produce a score AND a<br/>midifile. I&apos;ll wait until I can spare an extra half-life for that.</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2002 8:24:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;alternativetuning&quot; &lt;alternativetuning@y...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/35626">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/35626</a></p><p>That means 4096 parts to the semitone, 2048 to the quartertone.

Hmmm - I would think that implementing a MIDI<br/>command should be the same on both applications. If it&apos;s possible to<br/>increase the number of divisions of the octave, I&apos;ll bet you could do<br/>it equally well in either program - all it would take is a MIDI<br/>command.</p><p>As you&apos;ve mentioned, a lot depends on the capabilities of the sound<br/>card or synth that the computer is driving - you always need to check<br/>and see which MIDI messages are supported and which are not. In that<br/>aspect, Sibelius should be no better or worse than Finale - it&apos;s<br/>essentially sending &quot;dumb&quot; commands to another device that may or may<br/>not know how to handle them.</p><p>If you can find the MIDI command message to split a semitone into a<br/>greater or lesser number of parts, try sending that command through<br/>Sib and playing with the other pitch-bend commands and see what you<br/>get.</p><p>Jim Stanley&quot;</p><p>And, regarding the MIDI implementation in Version 2 of Sibelius:</p><p>&quot;While MIDI data are just byte streams that any program can send,<br/>there still needs to be a user &quot;command&quot; interface to construct the<br/>messages, so there could be differences between MIDI applications in<br/>that regard. For example, Sib 1.x provides only a few MIDI commands,<br/>while Sib 2 now gives access to almost all MIDI messages and<br/>controllers.</p><p>--N&quot;  (Norm Beck)</p><p>And from the Quicktime site that Manuel Op de Coul mentioned:</p><p>&quot;Using these defaults it is possible to divide the semitone into 32<br/>units. Using a pitch bend range to +/- 1 semitone you can 64 units<br/>per semitones.&quot;</p><p>***It looks like that is the MIDI command that I need to learn to use<br/>if I want to use the &quot;refined&quot; scale with Sibelius.</p><p>Now how to go about that...  ??</p><p>Anyway, the &quot;coarse&quot; scale works well enough for the moment.</p><p>Does anyone really think the 3 cent error is a &quot;big thing&quot; when<br/>considering the current state of &quot;sound card technology.&quot;</p><p>They don&apos;t seem like &quot;precision musical instruments&quot; at this point,<br/>do they??  Of course, a *real* player would probably put in more than<br/>3 cents in vibrato or error as well...  :)</p><p>jp</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>3/14/2002 8:58:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph wrote:<br/>&gt;***It looks like that is the MIDI command that I need to learn to use<br/>&gt;if I want to use the &quot;refined&quot; scale with Sibelius.</p><p>The command is simply MIDI pitch bend.
