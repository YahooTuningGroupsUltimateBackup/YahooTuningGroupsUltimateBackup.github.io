You are, indeed a &quot;tough customer,&quot; but the confusion in my<br/>paragraphs could also be the result of my limited memory of acoustics.  I<br/>did study acoustics with John Clough at the Univ. Michigan, but I have<br/>forgotten much of it by now -- although I still refer to the John Backus<br/>book...</p><p>Your &quot;original&quot; objection as I understood it (you may have more by now,<br/>possibly) had to do with the fact that I mentioned simple harmonic ratios<br/>as a property of any enclosed vibrating space.  I thought that was your<br/>basic objection, whereas such simple ratios ONLY apply to the partials<br/>created by the vocal cords.  You will note (I&apos;m not going to quote it again<br/>to save space), that I have ELIMINATED any reference to these simple ratios<br/>in the paragraph on the enclosed space -- but saved my mention of the<br/>simple ratios for the second paragraph, the vocal cord section.</p><p>If I am understanding this correctly -- and THIS is where I need your<br/>help... any enclosed space that is set to vibrate (like a wind column) has<br/>a given potential resonating fundamental and overtones which may OR MAY NOT<br/>be in integer multiples of the fundamental.  (Is that much right??)</p><p>When the shape of the enclosed space is changed to reinforce ONE harmonic<br/>of the vibrating space [and that harmonic may or MAY NOT be an integer<br/>multiple of a possible vibrating fundamental of the enclosed space], and<br/>that harmonic ALSO happens to coincide with ONE simple integer harmonic<br/>partial of the vocal chords, the &quot;whistling effect&quot; takes place.</p><p>(???)  Oui?  or wee-wee?</p><p>When I finally get this, I will rewrite the paragraphs again and send them<br/>along.  It might be nice if I could finally get this right!</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=8197 href="#8197">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

(Is that much right??)</p><p>True, the resonant frequencies may or may not form a harmonic series, if<br/>they don&apos;t, it may be meaningless to talk about a &quot;fundamental&quot; resonance,<br/>and, in your statement below, a &quot;harmonic of the vibrating space.&quot; The vocal<br/>cavity is certainly in this category.</p><p>&gt;When the shape of the enclosed space is changed to reinforce ONE harmonic<br/>&gt;of the vibrating space [and that harmonic may or MAY NOT be an integer<br/>&gt;multiple of a possible vibrating fundamental of the enclosed space], and<br/>&gt;that harmonic ALSO happens to coincide with ONE simple integer harmonic<br/>&gt;partial of the vocal chords, the &quot;whistling effect&quot; takes place.</p><p>What also often happens in throat singing is that two or more resonances<br/>from different parts of the vocal cavity are brought into alignment at an<br/>overtone of the vocal cord vibrations, and then you get a really pronounced<br/>whistling effect.</p><p>&gt;(???)  Oui?  or wee-wee?</p><p>Seems like a oui.</p></div>
