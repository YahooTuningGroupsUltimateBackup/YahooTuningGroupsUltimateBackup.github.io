I am a Junior<br/>(soon to be Senior) composition major at Illinois Wesleyan University, and<br/>also play the harpsichord.  Through the harpsichord I have learned about<br/>tuning, and my compostional interests have led me to explore many systems<br/>of alternate tuning.<br/>&#x9;First, are there any works in, or descriptions of, a tuning system<br/>where each octave contains a different tuning, retaining the 2:1 octave<br/>and a &apos;diatonic&apos; division of the octave into 12 parts?  I was considering<br/>basing a piece on a tuning where the C and F# have pure octaves over the<br/>full range, and the rest of the notes do not, and where each octave will<br/>have a strong tendency towards either the C or F#.  This is a very<br/>preliminary idea, not really delved into yet.<br/>&#x9;Secondly, I want to write some pieces that will be using<br/>microtones, and alternate tuning systems.  Anything that I write for<br/>harpsichord will be easy to handle, but I&apos;m not sure how to handle an<br/>ensemble.  For instance, I want to write a work for five flutes.  My<br/>thought was to write for five flutes where each of the flutes is tuned an<br/>equal distance around C by either pulling out or pushing in their<br/>mouthpiece.  I thought about just writing the piece with microtonal<br/>notation, but thought that by my tuning istructaion the performers would<br/>be aided in performance.  Am I correct in my instructions to have each<br/>flute &apos;mis-tune&apos;, or should they just tune to C and play the<br/>microtones.  I might add that these performers are not experienced in this<br/>type ogf music, and they are undergrad students.  Also, in a sense I don&apos;t<br/>want each flute playing microtones, each will play diatonic notes, just<br/>not relative to each other...<br/>&#x9;Thank you for your attention... I hope my questions were clear,<br/>and I look forward to responses...</p><p>&#x9;Steven Kallstrom</p></div><h3><a id=9931 href="#9931">ðŸ”—</a>Cedric Mannu &#x3C;cmannu@eternite.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2000 4:54:30 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi,</p><p>Thank you for your introduction,</p><p>I have a question quite similar,</p><p>do anybody on the list know about good softwares<br/>that make microtuning possible on a PC computer ?</p><p>12-scale, custom-scale, and so on ?</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Cedric Mannu<br/><a href="mailto:cmannu@eternite.com">cmannu@eternite.com</a></p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: Steven Kallstrom [<a href="mailto:skallstr@sun.iwu.edu">mailto:skallstr@sun.iwu.edu</a>]<br/>Sent: mardi 9 mai 2000 07:14<br/>To: Alternate Tuning List<br/>Subject: [tuning] Intro + Questions</p><p>Hello,</p><p>&#x9;I would like to introduce myself to the list...
