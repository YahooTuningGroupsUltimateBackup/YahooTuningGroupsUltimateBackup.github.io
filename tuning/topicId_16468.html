The total number of possible sets in 12tet is 12^2 or 4096,</p><p>Here is how it&apos;s done:</p><p>To find the answer, I looked up the sequence 1,6,19,43,66,80 in Sloane&apos;s On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</p><p><a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/index.html">http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/index.html</a></p><p>Result:</p><p>Sequence:  1,1,6,19,43,66,80,66,43,19,6,1,1<br/>Name:      Musical scales consisting of n notes.<br/>References R. C. Read, Combinatorial problems in theory of music, Discrete Math.<br/>              167 (1997), 543-551.<br/>Formula:   Coefft. of x^n in cycle index Z(C_12; 1+x).</p><p>However that formula is a bit cryptic. What does it mean?</p><p>It uses Polya&apos;s counting theorem.</p><p>First, we need the idea of a cycle. If you transpose a mode up by 3 notes in the<br/>12 tone scale, then repeat that transposition, after four repeats, each note gets<br/>back to where it started. Each note belongs to a cycle,and the length of the cycle<br/>is the number of repeats needed to get the note back to where it started.</p><p>So in this example, each note belongs to a cycle of four notes, and there are three such<br/>cycles altogether. In fact, these cycles are the notes of the three diminished seventh chords.</p><p>Transposition by 8 notes generates the same three cycles.</p><p>Similarly, for transposition up by 2 notes, you have two cycles, each of six notes,<br/>corresponding to the two possible whole tone scales. Ditto for 10 notes.</p><p>For transposition by 1, 5, 7 and 11 notes, you have a single cycle of 12 notes.</p><p>For transposition by 0 notes, you have 12 cycles each of one note (each note just stays<br/>where it is).</p><p>For transposition by 6 notes you have 6 cycles each of 2 notes, and for transposition by 4 notes, you have 4 cycles each<br/>of 3 notes (the four possible tritones).</p><p>Now to make all this into an equation.</p><p>The equation for each permutation consists of x1^a*x2^b*....<br/>where a is the number of cycles of length 1, b the number of cycles of length 2, and so on.</p><p>For instance, for the transposition by 4 notes, you have the four tritones, each of which is a cycle of 3 notes, so the<br/>term that this contributes is x3^4. The other tritone ransposition by 8 notes adds an identical term.</p><p>For some pictures of these permutations, see<br/><a href="http://www.arch.gatech.edu/~economou/research/m&d98/">http://www.arch.gatech.edu/~economou/research/m&d98/</a></p><p>Look under Cycle index | computation</p><p>This shows the first seven of the twelve rotations of the dodecagon (rotation by 12-n has same<br/>picture as rotation by n). It also has the reflections, which we<br/>ignore for this problem (but would include if counting inversions as equivalent).</p><p>You then add together all the terms, and divide by the total number of permutations in the group:</p><p>(x1^12 + x2^6 + 2*x3^4  + 2*x4^3 +2*x6^2 + 4*x12)/12</p><p>This is called the cycle index polynomial.</p><p>Then, to apply Polya&apos;s counting theorem, you replace x1 by<br/>(t1+t2+...+tn), x2 by (t1^2+t2^2+...+tn^2), etc, where n is the number of colourings -<br/>in this case, there are just two colourings for each note - included, or not included.<br/>But if you wanted to have, say, notes that are muted as a third poss, then you could<br/>use n=3, and so on.</p><p>Since there are just two possibilities, let&apos;s call them x and y. (in the ref. above, they<br/>were called x and 1, which is also okay).</p><p>So equation becomes:<br/>(<br/>(x+y)^12<br/>+ ((x^2+y^2)^6<br/>+ 2*((x^3+y^3)^4<br/>+ 2*((x^4+y^4)^3<br/>+ 2*((x^6+y^6)^2<br/>+ 4*(x^12+y^12)<br/>)/12</p><p>Then Polya&apos;s counting theorem says that the number of distinct ways of<br/>colouring n notes is the coefficient of x^n*y^(12-n) in this equation.</p><p>The odd numbers are particularly easy to find since most of the<br/>terms are for all powers even, and so can be ignored.</p><p>We only need to expand:<br/>(((x+y)^12 + 2*(x^3+y^3)^4)/12</p><p>Let&apos;s look for the term x^3*y^9.<br/>Using row 12 of Pascal&apos;s triangle:<br/>1    12    66   220   495   792   924   792   495   220    66    12     1<br/>(from e.g. <a href="http://www-chem430.scs.uiuc.edu/nmr-resources/pascal/pascal1.htm">http://www-chem430.scs.uiuc.edu/nmr-resources/pascal/pascal1.htm</a>)<br/>then it&apos;s coeff in (x+y)^12 is 220<br/>It&apos;s coeff in 2*(x^3+y^3)^4 is 8<br/>So we want 228/12 = 19.</p><p>Now try n = 5</p><p>then it&apos;s coeff in (x+y)^12 is 792<br/>It&apos;s coeff in 2*(x^3+y^3)^4 is 0<br/>So we want 792/12 = 66.</p><p>Now let&apos;s try n = 19<br/>This is easy because it is prime, so all the entries, except the identity are made up of 19-cycles.<br/>Cycle index formula:<br/>(x^19+18*x19)/19</p><p>Polya&apos;s formula:<br/>(x+y)^19 + 18*(x^19+y^19))/19</p><p>So, except for the 0 and 19 note cases, we only need to look at nth term in (x+y)^19<br/>Using row 19 of Pascal&apos;s triangle:</p><p>1, 1, 9, 51, 204, 612, 1428, 2652, 3978, 4862, 3978, 2652, 1428, 612, 204, 51, 9, 1, 1</p><p>For Thai equal 7 tone scale,<br/>1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1<br/>-&gt;<br/>1, 1, 3, 5, 5, 3, 1.</p><p>For example, the five three note scales are (showing the steps, e.g. 0 2 5 is an example of 2 3):<br/>1 1, 1 2, 1 3, (1 4 is same as 1 3)<br/>2 2, 2 3<br/>3 2 (same as 2 3).</p><p>Let&apos;s work out one more example</p><p>For 15-tet:</p><p>Cycle index formula:<br/>transposition by 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14 all yield single cycle of 15 notes, i.e. x15.</p><p>Identity gives x1^15 (as usual).</p><p>Transposition by 3, 6, 9 and 12 yield x5^3 (each is made up of three 5-cycles).</p><p>Transposition by 5, 10 yield x3^5 (each made of five 3-cycles).</p><p>So cycle index formula is<br/>(x1^15 + 2*x3^5 + 3*x5^3 + 9*x15)/15</p><p>Polya&apos;s formula<br/>((x+y)^15 + 2*(x^3+y^3)^5 + 3*(x^5+y^5)^3 + 9*(x^15+y^15))/15</p><p>So for example, to find the number of 6 note scales in 15-tet,<br/>need coeff. of x^6, so only need first two terms.</p><p>Coeff,. of x^6 in ((x+y)^15<br/>Using 15th row of Pascal&apos;s triangle<br/>1 15 105 455 1365 3003 5005 6435 6435 5005 3003 1365 455 105 15 1<br/>we see it is 5005</p><p>Coeff. of x^6 in 2*(x^3+y^3)^5, using<br/>1 5 10 10 5 1<br/>is 20</p><p>So answer is 5025/15 = 335.</p><p>To treat inversions as identical, need to add extra terms for these.</p><p>In 12-tet there are 12 possible inversions - 6 reflecting in a note, and also 6 in gap<br/>between two notes.</p><p>E.g.<br/>1 2   3   4  5 6 7 8  9 10 11 12<br/>-&gt;<br/>12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1<br/>(inverting in gap between 7 and 8 - all notes change)<br/>or<br/>-&gt;<br/>1 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2<br/> (1 and 7 remain unchanged)</p><p>First type has 6 cycles each of length 2, e.g. 1 -&gt; 12 -&gt; 1.<br/>term in the cycle index equation  before the divide by 24:<br/>6*x2^6 (12 such inversions).</p><p>Second type has 5 cycles of length 2, and two cycles of length 1.<br/>You multiply the results, so the contribution to the cycle index equation is<br/>6*x2^5 * x1^2</p><p>So equation now is<br/>(x1^12 + 7*x2^6  + 2*x4^3 + 2*x3^4 + 6*x^5*x1^2 +2*x6^2 + 4*x12)/24</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=16480 href="#16480">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
