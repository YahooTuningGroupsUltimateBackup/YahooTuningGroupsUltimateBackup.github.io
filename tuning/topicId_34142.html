Very smooth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s pure barbershop.</p><p>Assuming the reference is to the first item on Monz&apos;s MIDI page, I keep<br/>listening to it and find that it bothers my ear. To me, the second chord (F)<br/>is flat. Also, the third chord (G7) sounds jarring and disconnected from the<br/>progression.</p><p>I see in the numbers that Dave has lowered the second chord--evidently to<br/>move the F in the IV chord toward the F in the V7. (I&apos;m assuming that Dave&apos;s<br/>comment about my singers &quot;hiding&quot; something has to do with the concept of<br/>&quot;comma&quot; that I see mentioned frequently on the List. Right?) That may signal<br/>a basic difference between current microtuning practice (for keyboards?) and<br/>what I call &quot;flexible&quot; tuning (by ear) for singers--as well as for string<br/>and wind players.</p><p>I believe I would much rather the F chord be tuned (likely 2:3) *to* the<br/>original C. (That&apos;s the tonality around which the cadence centers and<br/>hopefully is being strongly maintained in a singer&apos;s ear.) I also think that<br/>the G in the third chord would relate directly to the C tonic (instead of<br/>raising it 9.1 cents).</p><p>I think the &quot;rub&quot; here is that I would have no problem with the F &quot;moving&quot;<br/>during the change from the second to third chord. No need to worry about a<br/>&quot;comma.&quot; That&apos;s what flexible tuning, in my mind, is all about.</p><p>One of the drills I do with my students is to have them sing and tune E-F-E<br/>while hearing roots move C-F-C and then C-G-C. The difference in the tuning<br/>of the F is clearly evident (even when singing to 12edo keyboard roots) and<br/>hopefully will become a part of the contextual-tuning &quot;vocabulary&quot; the<br/>student takes with him into the real world.</p><p>The only other feature I would likely &quot;adjust&quot; is the tuning of the leading<br/>tone (B) in the V7 chord. As you likely remember, I like a higher tuning of<br/>the third, particularly in the context of a contracting d5 tritone. Of<br/>course, we decided last year that my &quot;high third&quot; was likely a personal<br/>stylistic deviation. Okay. So be it. I like it! (And, apparently, so do a<br/>great many other tuning-sensitive musicians.)</p><p>Do I sense correctly that the Blackjack scale is intended to offer a kind of<br/>flexible tuning to keyboard composition that is akin to &quot;intuitive&quot; vocal<br/>tuning?</p><p>Thanks again to Monz for preparing his page of progressions. I want to get<br/>back to that as soon as I can. When I do, I&apos;ll be happy to offer again (but<br/>hopefully with &quot;better&quot; ears) my whatever-they&apos;re-worth reactions.</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2002 3:19:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think the &quot;rub&quot; here is that I would have no problem with the F<br/>&quot;moving&quot;<br/>&gt; during the change from the second to third chord.

Besides, sort by<br/>subject isn&apos;t as good as &quot;up thread&quot; (which is pretty bad!).</p><p>Then I think about what it could be.

No ads.  Our own domain.  The<br/>software that can do all this is free, if requiring some skill and<br/>time to set up and maintain.

I ordered these<br/>&gt;when you mentioned them before. I&apos;ll dig them out and listen<br/>&gt;specifically for lead-line tuning. Thanks for the memory jog.</p><p>Let me know what you think!</p><p>&gt;Speaking of Bulgarians, my keyboardist and co-producer of LA Jazz<br/>&gt;Choir&apos;s &quot;From All Sides,&quot; Milcho Leviev, came to this country many<br/>&gt;years ago to play with the Don Ellis big band.</p><p>Cool!  Paul actually turned me on to the Don Ellis big band, though<br/>Jonny Reinhard had mentioned Ellis to me slightly earlier.</p><p>&gt;&gt; BTW, did you ever get my MP3s up and running? I&apos;d be interested to<br/>&gt;&gt; get your feedback on the tuning produced by those well-seasoned<br/>&gt;&gt; college kids fresh from a tour of Europe.</p><p>&gt;&gt;I missed the link.  Can you re-post it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;These were never posted, Carl. I attached them to an email sent<br/>&gt;directly to Paul a few weeks ago. Apparently, he couldn&apos;t get them<br/>&gt;to play on his setup. How about an even trade: my college kids<br/>&gt;for your tape???</p><p>I don&apos;t even have a tape recorder anymore, or a cd burner for that<br/>matter.  Two completely obsolete technologies!  (too bad nothing is<br/>ready to take the place of cd yet...)  Some day in the far, far<br/>future, I can rip those tracks and put them on my ftp site for you.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d post them on my website but I need to check with Earthlink to<br/>&gt;see why people can&apos;t get directly to pages on my site.
