I personally prefer the pointed consonances to the rounded ones.</p><p>Incidentally, when I used partials with amplitudes equal to 1/n rather than<br/>1, the curves were nowhere near as dramatic. Since the Sethares theory is<br/>supposedly based on psychoacoustics, I question whether the &quot;average<br/>untrained ear&quot; perceives consonance and dissonance the way the harmonic<br/>entropy curve and the unit-amplitude Sethares curve show, or more the way<br/>the 1/n scaled amplitude curve shows.</p><p>Clearly we musical folk can hear these things, but can our more naive<br/>listeners? The relative smoothness of the curve for harmonic sounds with<br/>descending-amplitude partials might explain why the masses have little<br/>trouble enjoying 12-TET music on conventional instruments, despite the<br/>theory that says the equal tempered major third, for example, is &quot;woefully<br/>out of tune&quot;. I&apos;m going to plot the two curves on the same graph and upload<br/>the picture a little later.</p><p>One other note: I haven&apos;t said much about Xenakis in this discussion, and<br/>his theories and techniques share equal footing with those of Partch in this<br/>work. In passing, though, I would like to note that there is a section in<br/>_Formalized Music_ about the evolution of music from the Ancient Greek<br/>tetrachords that I think is highly relevant. I doubt if there is anything in<br/>it that the folks here haven&apos;t already seen, but it was one of the things<br/>that triggered my interest in combining Xenakis and Partch.<br/>--<br/>M.

Thus, his curve has an otonal bias.<br/>&gt; Partch&apos;s does not - it is strictly a dyadic interval measure, which<br/>&gt; exhibits the dualistic (otonal/utonal) properties that are fundamental<br/>&gt; to Partch&apos;s theories.</p><p>Well, as the title of Sethares&apos; book is _Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale_, I<br/>think his goals are somewhat broader than that, and indeed, broader than<br/>mine at the moment. My goal is to produce a piece and the tools to create<br/>the piece. I don&apos;t see the &quot;otonal bias&quot; in the Sethares curves. The bias I<br/>*do* see there is that the Sethares equations depend, as does the underlying<br/>theory, on the absolute frequencies at which the notes are played. The<br/>harmonic entropy curves, IIRC, are purely based on ratios. My curves were<br/>generated with 1/1 equal to Partch&apos;s G 392. Since my piece will use the<br/>Partch scale, I intend to use purely harmonic timbres to maximize the<br/>consonances, and it will probably be centered at G392. And I certainly<br/>intend to use both Otonalities and Utonalities.</p><p>&gt; IMO, the harmonic entropy curve is much closer to what you&apos;re trying<br/>&gt; to do.  Sethares&apos;s curves are implemented with larger collections<br/>&gt; of pitches in mind (triads, tetrads, pentads, hexads, etc.).</p><p>My intention is to use all of these (although there is only one hexad in<br/>each tonality).</p><p>&gt; BTW, as you should be aware, I&apos;m interested in implementing a<br/>&gt; number of Partch&apos;s theoretical procedures in JustMusic.  I just<br/>&gt; posted something to that group last week about creating a window<br/>&gt; to display his &quot;Field of Attraction&quot;:<br/>&gt; <a href="/justmusic/topicId_unknown.html#144">/justmusic/topicId_unknown.html#144</a></p><p>Once I get my code working and my piece in construction, I&apos;ll contribute it<br/>to JustMusic. It will most likely be in C, since &quot;sfront&quot; is written in C<br/>and creates output files in C and Derive can write C code. The Field Of<br/>Attraction is one element I will be using.</p></div><h3><a id=165 href="#165">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2000 1:22:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: M.
