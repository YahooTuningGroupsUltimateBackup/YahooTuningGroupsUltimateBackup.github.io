The tuning for the pianos is too close.  I&apos;m not sure it is consistently so.  It is disappointing, no, it is released in that condition.</p><p>As many here know, a piano tuned a quartertone lower will often rise up in pitch soon after.  Some tuners plan for the amount of rise....and they can be wrong.   Guess this means Mr. C. doesn&apos;t hear any difference.</p><p>Johnny<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>Check out the new AOL.
