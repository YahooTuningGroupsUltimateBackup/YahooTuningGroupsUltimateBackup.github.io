When 2 people send the same tuning,<br/>the one that was sent to me first will count the other not.<br/>The only submissions I will not accept are tunings of previously made public<br/>submissions with just one or 2 notes slightly different etc, only serious<br/>submissions please.</p><p>Why am I calling out this competition?<br/>I think it will help people take a good look at my solution, see/hear that<br/>there is not better solution (should mine win), and hope this will prove<br/>that JI can do all common practice music and do it better than any other<br/>tuning.<br/>I think my solution will likely win, though if there&apos;s a better solution out<br/>there I will gladly pay &euro;100.- to know about it.<br/>In the end, I also hope this competition will lead to more people getting<br/>involved in retuning common practice music and in this way help move forward<br/>insights into tuning systems and music.</p><p>You can find the Drei Equali No.1 files at <a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a><br/>The score, 12tet MIDI and mp3 audio.<br/>And my JI submission in MIDI (much improved version of my earlyer post of<br/>this piece), Scala sequence file and JI transcription in an excell sheet<br/>(which you can modify and copy/paste into the Scala sequence file should you<br/>choose to work this way).</p><p>I hope this is well received.

The &quot;Nyquist&quot; frequency is the highest<br/>frequency that can be represented at a given sample rate - exactly<br/>half that sample rate. So since you&apos;ll be working at 44100 Hz, the<br/>highest frequency that can be represented is 22050 Hz.

So the<br/>excessive &quot;buzzing&quot; that you hear when you play a digital sawtooth<br/>wave has nothing to do with too much overtone content, it has to do<br/>with aliasing and jitter.

Music has been his<br/>life for over 10 years.<br/>He has finished his conservatory (school of music in english?) study some<br/>years ago.</p><p>This is what he said in an email today (translated from Dutch:<br/>&quot;I&apos;ve just listened 2 times to all 3 files.<br/>If I&apos;m very honest, my preference certainly goes to the standard western<br/>tuning, but this could surely be because of of simply beeing used to<br/>it...I&apos;m also not a big fan of the pythagorean..<br/>I&apos;ve listened with an open mind to your JI version, but the first minor<br/>chord just won&apos;t sound nice to me, and there&apos;s also a dim chord that<br/>&quot;dissonates&quot; quite a bit to me..<br/>What you said may be true: that in your tuning the dominants have a stronger<br/>&apos;pull&apos; back.</p><p>Tough matter. I&apos;ve been conditioned for so long to standard tuning..<br/>I will listen later for one more time, to see if I can get used to it..&quot;</p><p>Had this person been given a simple double blind test without any other<br/>info, he would not have hesitated to immediately vote for 12tet.<br/>Yet I allready know beforehand that given enough time and listening<br/>guidance, this person will start &quot;hearing&quot; right and will eventually vote<br/>for the JI version.<br/>I assume that most people on this list if given the choice between 12tet and<br/>my JI version on <a href="http://www.develde.net">www.develde.net</a> will vote for the JI version.<br/>Yet had you been asked to do so before you got into tuning, most of you<br/>would have probably voted for 12tet.</p><p>To correctly interpret tuning is something more difficult than simply taking<br/>a double blind test.<br/>Double blind test means less than a well informed listen, and a listen over<br/>a longer period of time in the case of comparing tunings.</p><p>One other thing.<br/>A double blind test isn&apos;t even possible. Many tunings will be guessed right<br/>away and for instance mine is well known beforehand.<br/>One other thing, in double blind people can&apos;discuss tunings. I&apos;d like to<br/>have the files up for listening for a week before voting starts, and then<br/>have voting for a week. This doesn&apos;t work well for blind tests as people<br/>will discuss things.<br/>Yet to put the files up and start voting immediately and only for a short<br/>time is too rediculous for words in the case of comparing tunings. That<br/>won&apos;t give right results, and some people will have formed very different<br/>opinions after a few days allready.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=85622 href="#85622">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2010 9:46:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Marcel,</p><p>With all due respect I fail to see the point in this contest besides<br/>throwing away 100 euros.<br/>Personally I&apos;d rather you spent the money on some good software for you to<br/>use to generate your examples.</p><p>I honestly think a contest is a poor venue to educate people about JI as you<br/>outlined in the quote below.
