The question is then &quot;how much<br/>like 12tet?&quot;, and the answer probably sounded something like one of &quot;well<br/>temperaments&quot; then being propagated as solutions allowing one to play in all<br/>keys of a 12-tone cycle.</p><p>I think that Paul Erlich and I agree that meantone largely defines the<br/>resources and limitations of the common practice harmonic language, and that<br/>there was an initial move towards equal temperament in the late Baroque (the<br/>so-called well temperaments) that did not really become realized in a final<br/>way until the middle of the 19th century. Thus, while there is some Baroque<br/>repertoire -- like the WTC -- that demands something other than meantone (or<br/>meantone plus an active tuning hammer), the music of the Viennese classical<br/>era, which sticks to the best meantone keys, largely remains within the<br/>limits of meantone.</p></div>
