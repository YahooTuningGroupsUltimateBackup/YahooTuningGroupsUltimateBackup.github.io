I&apos;ve downloaded the clips and had a quick look at some<br/>&gt; spectrograms. While I need to study them further, there was one thing I<br/>&gt; noticed right away. Instead of generating subharmonic partials, what is<br/>&gt; happening is that the main note you are singing is becomming the third<br/>&gt; partial of a series with a fundamental a twelvth lower. What shows up on the<br/>&gt; spectrogram is both a fifth and a twelvth below the principal sung note.<br/>&gt; Fascinating stuff!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; dante</p><p>Hello dante,</p><p>I forgot to ask last night if on the spectrogram there is the octave below the<br/>principal sung note.  I hear it and esp. before the octave and fifth below<br/>principal note sung (hereafter &quot;pns&quot;) kicks in.  This is part of the reason I am<br/>still seduced by the idea of these being part of a subharmonic series - because<br/>that structure of intervals appear from the singing - it seems to unfold<br/>naturally - that is, from pns a note an octave below appears as I&apos;m singing,<br/>then a bass note a fifth below that comes (although I&apos;m not always able to<br/>clearly hear the octave with this clearly), etc. - perhaps I need to put another<br/>clip up showing this transition to demonstrate what I mean.  What puzzles me<br/>also is that I don&apos;t hear &quot;sub 4&quot; (two octaves below pns) while progressing from<br/>sub 3 to sub 5.</p><p>Thanks for the help...</p><p>~Jim</p></div><h3><a id=4321 href="#4321">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

All powers of 2 can fit within a finite<br/>portion of parameter space (along the axis which defines the &quot;degree of<br/>nonlinearity&quot;) since each power of 2 occupies a range of parameter values<br/>that is 1/4.67 times smaller than that occupied by the previous power of two<br/>(at least analytically in the typical case of a quadratic nonlinearity and<br/>experimentally in many physical situations).
