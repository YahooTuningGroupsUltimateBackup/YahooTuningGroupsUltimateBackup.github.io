I heard a live performance<br/>of the &quot;Suite for microtonal piano&quot; at last year&apos;s Microfest, and it struck me<br/>as very effective - ratios of 7 &amp; 11 seemed quite well characterised &amp;<br/>consonant. How does this relate to or interact with the inharmonic aspects of<br/>the piano, and to what degree can a just tuning be satisfactorily realised on<br/>piano?I guess I was pretty convinced by the Johnston piece that it can be<br/>effective, but I still hesitate to compose for just piano myself (I don&apos;t have<br/>an instrument to experiment on myself at the moment). Can I just assume that at<br/>least a passable impression of just will be created,despite octave stretching,<br/>or are there other factors to consider? Etc. etc. etc.Any feedback will be<br/>appreciated...ThanksChris</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/>[<a href="http://go.msn.com/bql/hmtag_itl_EN.asp">http://go.msn.com/bql/hmtag_itl_EN.asp</a>]</p></div><h3><a id=28010 href="#28010">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2001 1:45:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Just tunings can be represented fairly well on the piano. Listen to<br/>LaMonte Young&apos;s _The Well-Tuned Piano_. You&apos;ll want to use the usual<br/>stretching curves, after which, the smaller intervals (those not<br/>exceeding a fifth or octave) will behave pretty much as they do in JI<br/>(some beating will be inevitable, though).</p></div>
