A continous spout of 30 posts<br/>or more a day that lead nowhere in particular - argument for the sake<br/>of argument per se - and are far from abiding to proper netiquette is<br/>stealing the precious time and mailbox space of a thousand subscribers<br/>among whom are professionals who have long since reverted to utter<br/>silence...</p><p>I state this as a concern to the list as a whole, for I have my<br/>filters in force whenever the need for them arises.</p><p>My eyes search for highly informative and novelty messages (and even<br/>harangue and  entertainment) from Johnny Reinhard, Paul Poletti, Brad<br/>Lehman, Andreas Sparschuh, Charles Lucy, Jacques Dudon, Graham Breed, Aaron Andrew Hunt, George Secor, Dave Keenan, Herman Miller, Shaahin<br/>Mohajeri, Joe Monzo (in no particular order, and apologies to those<br/>whom I neglected to mention)... most of whom virtually dissappeared<br/>into oblivion while a few linger on. And the ones who once rocked this<br/>platform with their dumbfounding knowledge on matters such as Gene<br/>Ward Smith, Daniel Forro and Carl Lumma have succumbed to this<br/>horrific intellectual indolence.</p><p>The primary mandate of the Alternate Tuning List is to EXCHANGE<br/>ideas... for which one must have the inclination and/or foreknowledge<br/>on pertinent subjects to GRASP an idea. Go read again the Group<br/>Description. Does it say &quot;anyone interested in tuning&quot;? Back when we<br/>had good common sense, we used to jettison such people who incessantly<br/>throwed at us yarnspins on 12-EDO. The scourge has returned today<br/>under the hood of a &quot;makeshift JI hobbyism&quot;.</p><p>When I first approached this list many years ago, I did not barge in<br/>like an elephant with grandiose pretensions and a knack for<br/>relativizing wholesome things to twist topics. I tried to learn and<br/>understand from my elders and betters in humility. Granted, my early<br/>excitement did sometimes get the better of me, I tried nevertheless to<br/>approach the science of tuning from a methodical perspective and with<br/>a practicable goal and specific focus. Back then, when I once could<br/>not resist the urge to name a comma I calculated after myself, I was<br/>chastised to remember that it is others who rightly name things after<br/>you and render you any recognition if you are indeed worthy of it.<br/>That was then...</p><p>Who has the power here? Obviously the common mentality and good sense<br/>that dominates the list. I truly wish it is not anymore the slipshod<br/>undisciplined pretentious attitude that has blown like a scourge for<br/>the past year hereabouts. And if need be, measures should be taken to<br/>keep such a devastating, crippling, mass-inducing habit in check.</p><p>I have noticed with great dismay that Carl is very much slipping in<br/>moderation. No personal offence inteded to him! It&apos;s a simple matter<br/>to get carried away in the wake of such carefree anarchistic trends as<br/>we face today. And he is a family man with distractions of his own. As<br/>such, I strongly believe a change of office is in order.</p><p>My concern has never been about PhD titles and ranks. It&apos;s always been<br/>an issue of clarity, understandability, proper conduct and unambiguous<br/>purpose when sending messages to everyone.

The question then, to me, becomes what exactly falls under tuning<br/>math.<br/>  Is something such as &quot;I think I see a pattern in the way certain ratios sound<br/>and so have a few people I&apos;ve tested&quot; tuning-math or just tuning?<br/>  I&apos;m tempted to say most of what I work on is based on consonance (partly<br/>subjective, partly inferring to past research) and not concordance (more based<br/>on direct signal processing theory with a tad of psychology thrown in).</p><p>  The latter seems to say &quot;this is a subject academic papers could be written<br/>about&quot;...so I suspect the tuning-math list would be an appropriate place for<br/>those who discussion that&apos;s &quot;scientifically backed&quot; to a degree it could qualify<br/>in an academic journal.  And even then I also agree with what your last post<br/>appears to infer; that if only certain very narrow sub-topics of academic theory<br/>IE &quot;ethnic scales&quot; count to those people as &quot;real tuning discussion&quot;...then they<br/>are likely going to be unsatisfied no matter what accommodations can be made<br/>realistically.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2010 11:10:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Or maybe we should just be more<br/>&gt; diligent in taking things to tuning-math, which has recently been<br/>&gt; completely dead.</p><p>Tuning-math is appropriate only for discussions using math.</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2010 11:11:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ozan,</p><p>     Firstly, fair enough, the list advertisement/wording has been changed.  It<br/>did used to say anyone interested in tunings, but no longer does.  However, it<br/>does say:<br/>         &quot;This mailing list is intended for exchanging ideas relevant to<br/>alternate musical tunings: just intonation; paratactical tunings; experimental<br/>instrument design; non-standard equal temperaments....etc.&quot; -tuning list<br/>advertisement/intro</p><p>    And, what Mike B has been discussing about major/minor-ness is very closely<br/>related to both Just Intonation and alternative Temperament...thus being quite<br/>on topic whether you find it useful or not.  (note: I realize you even write off<br/>on-topic JI discussion as being &quot;makeshift JI&quot;)</p><p>&gt;&quot;A continous spout of 30 posts or more a day that lead nowhere in particular&quot;<br/>    Unless we&apos;re talking about something as objective as the history of tuning<br/>or math behind an existing theory, a lot of what we describe is debate.  Since<br/>music is partly subjective such debate is inevitable: even under a strict topic<br/>like JI some people are going to say their ears gravitate toward different<br/>answers and dish out examples until there&apos;s a clear winner.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Charles Lucy, Jacques Dudon, Graham Breed, Aaron Andrew Hunt, George Secor,<br/>&gt;Dave Keenan, Herman Miller, Shaahin Mohajeri, Joe Monzo&quot;<br/>  Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but what these people seem to have in common (in<br/>general) in their discussion style is they typically talk about things already<br/>done in tuning rather than, say, create and debate new tunings or new ways of<br/>interpreting old tunings.<br/>   They generally seem to avoid heavy debate and, if they post anything new,<br/>they just say &quot;try this&quot; and then don&apos;t follow up often to debate the solution&apos;s<br/>subjective qualities.  Which is fine but, to me, it seems obvious debate has its<br/>place as that&apos;s how many new theories are formed...which, if they do well,<br/>become part of not-so-debatable history.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I did not barge in like an elephant with grandiose pretensions and a knack for<br/>&gt;relativizing wholesome things to twist topics.&quot;<br/>   That seems to imply that in order to make something new you have to<br/>completely disregard or disrespect something older.  Which, of course, isn&apos;t the<br/>case at all: hence why I&apos;m very careful to state anything I write here as a new<br/>&quot;alternative&quot; and NOT a &quot;substitute/replacement&quot;.  The only people I&apos;ve really<br/>seen here who seem to say their ideas are a replacement for something are<br/>Charles Lucy and Marcel.  If you by chance think people like myself or Mike B or<br/>Igs aren&apos;t humble toward experts in the field, that just shows you aren&apos;t<br/>reading us well at all.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Back then, when I once could not resist the urge to name a comma I calculated<br/>&gt;after myself, I was chastised to remember that it is others who rightly name<br/>&gt;things after you and render you any recognition if you are indeed worthy of it.&quot;<br/>   Interesting example.  Thing is...I don&apos;t see Mike B, Igs, myself...going<br/>around naming parts of tuning theory after ourselves either.  I occasionally try<br/>to name a tuning with my own name if I can&apos;t find it in the Scala archive...and<br/>even then my next step is always to check my scale against this list to see if<br/>anyone in history has already made the scale (and to give credit if they<br/>have!)    And hey, if I run into an existing scale by virtue of my own<br/>calculation (especially if it&apos;s a famous one by, say, Partch or<br/>Ptolemy)...doesn&apos;t that to some extent serve as to say I&apos;m on the right track?<br/>:-D</p><p>&gt;&quot;I truly wish it is not anymore the slipshod undisciplined pretentious<br/>attitude&quot;<br/>      Examples?  You give the impression that you think any sort of debate not<br/>based directly on tuning history (including debate on the feeling of music and<br/>psycho-acoustics) automatically qualifies as &quot;undisciplined pretentious<br/>attitude&quot;.<br/>   I, for one, may not be a PHD, but I&apos;m surely not an undisciplined...and<br/>neither are the many people you complain about virtually all of who have college<br/>degrees,VERY hard working attitudes, and honest intent to make progress: be it<br/>through long debates or simply reviewing historical tuning facts and<br/>terminology.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The scourge has returned today under the hood of a &quot;makeshift JI hobbyism&quot;.&quot;<br/>   I guess you could say people like Sevish, Igs, and I would be stuffed under<br/>that umbrella.  And yet, I&apos;ve seen you make very positive comments on all of our<br/>works, many of which are based on our own takes on JI.  In fact, Sevish is<br/>probably my favorite artist on here...with Igs not far at all behind and on a<br/>level with what compositions I&apos;ve heard from you.<br/>   My point: if it (these theories and debate you consider &quot;pointless&quot; and<br/>&quot;undisciplined&quot;) constantly results in relatively good music (and isn&apos;t that the<br/>ultimate point of music theory in the end of the day?)...what on earth do you<br/>think is so makeshift/&apos;temporary&apos;/&apos;cheap&apos; about it?!</p><p>&gt;&quot;My concern has never been about PhD titles and ranks. It&apos;s always been an issue<br/>&gt;of clarity, understandability, proper conduct and unambiguous purpose when<br/>&gt;sending messages to everyone. Thus, seperation of the &quot;tuning kindergarten&quot; and<br/>&gt;&quot;microtonal academy&quot; indeed appears to be a good notion on your part!&quot;</p><p>    But you see, my poiny is it&apos;s not a matter of better or worse (Kindergarten<br/>vs. Academy?! :-S  ), but a matter of more vs. less academically applicable<br/>styles of viewing music theory.</p><p>  An easy example of this is something like The Beatles or one of the many<br/>legendary bands of the past with little to no formal academic training compared<br/>to an academic standard like Beethoven who was formally trained from early<br/>childhood.  If you made a group with &quot;The Beatles&quot;, you may well spend a lot of<br/>time speculating and debating about how motifs can be mixed and the goal<br/>emotions, while in the &quot;Beethoven&quot; group, you may talk about specific<br/>mathematical patterns in the motifs.<br/>   The &quot;Beethoven&quot; group may write a great paper while the &quot;Beatles&quot; group may<br/>inspire a new popular band like &quot;Nirvana&quot; that focuses on twisting the Beatles&apos;<br/>techniques in new ways...both are admirable goals in music.<br/>    That&apos;s not saying either is better, but just that the focus is different.</p><p>&gt;&quot;This should be immediately put into effect on a plausible change of<br/>moderator.&quot;<br/>     I definitely agree with the separation of list idea, but not with the idea<br/>of splitting the list into better or worse...but rather less academically<br/>focused vs. more academically focused.</p></div><h3>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2010 11:21:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>A change of moderator?

I for one agree with you that posts here are often excessive, frequently unproductive, and occasionally completely annoying.  But as this is a public forum, and one of the only places on the internet where a person can come to learn about and discuss tuning, I do not feel it is in the public interest to enforce heavy moderation of the list.  This is not the &quot;Maqamat&quot; list, or the &quot;Circulating Temperaments&quot; list, or the &quot;Neo-Medieval Music&quot; list; it is simply the &quot;Tuning&quot; list.  Presumably, it was created to have a broad mission and to be open to the public for a good reason.  If you feel that this list is too &quot;open&quot; to unqualified or unrefined people, I encourage you to form a more exclusive list, tailored to your high standards, and invite to it all those whom you admire or respect--those whose voices you feel have been lost in the flood from us &quot;amateurs&quot;.  If these others share your disdain for this list, surely they will follow you to a more exclusive and focused forum--perhaps you can make it invite-only?</p><p>Surely, this approach will yield more satisfying results than petitioning the one authority on this list to relinquish his status on behalf of a silent--but allegedly-disapproving--majority.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>-Igliashon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Michael,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The style of your quoting is not facilitating the task of the reader.<br/>&gt; I personally reply this once to you in order to re-clarify what has<br/>&gt; already been clarified by myself several times before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The conundrum you, Mike, Marcel, Igs and the lot who got tugged along<br/>&gt; into the whirlpool of TRULY unproductive roundabouts keep at has<br/>&gt; become a matter of grave concern to me. A continous spout of 30 posts<br/>&gt; or more a day that lead nowhere in particular - argument for the sake<br/>&gt; of argument per se - and are far from abiding to proper netiquette is<br/>&gt; stealing the precious time and mailbox space of a thousand subscribers<br/>&gt; among whom are professionals who have long since reverted to utter<br/>&gt; silence...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I state this as a concern to the list as a whole, for I have my<br/>&gt; filters in force whenever the need for them arises.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My eyes search for highly informative and novelty messages (and even<br/>&gt; harangue and  entertainment) from Johnny Reinhard, Paul Poletti, Brad<br/>&gt; Lehman, Andreas Sparschuh, Charles Lucy, Jacques Dudon, Graham Breed,<br/>&gt; Aaron Andrew Hunt, George Secor, Dave Keenan, Herman Miller, Shaahin<br/>&gt; Mohajeri, Joe Monzo (in no particular order, and apologies to those<br/>&gt; whom I neglected to mention)... most of whom virtually dissappeared<br/>&gt; into oblivion while a few linger on. And the ones who once rocked this<br/>&gt; platform with their dumbfounding knowledge on matters such as Gene<br/>&gt; Ward Smith, Daniel Forro and Carl Lumma have succumbed to this<br/>&gt; horrific intellectual indolence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The primary mandate of the Alternate Tuning List is to EXCHANGE<br/>&gt; ideas... for which one must have the inclination and/or foreknowledge<br/>&gt; on pertinent subjects to GRASP an idea. Go read again the Group<br/>&gt; Description. Does it say &quot;anyone interested in tuning&quot;? Back when we<br/>&gt; had good common sense, we used to jettison such people who incessantly<br/>&gt; throwed at us yarnspins on 12-EDO. The scourge has returned today<br/>&gt; under the hood of a &quot;makeshift JI hobbyism&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I first approached this list many years ago, I did not barge in<br/>&gt; like an elephant with grandiose pretensions and a knack for<br/>&gt; relativizing wholesome things to twist topics. I tried to learn and<br/>&gt; understand from my elders and betters in humility. Granted, my early<br/>&gt; excitement did sometimes get the better of me, I tried nevertheless to<br/>&gt; approach the science of tuning from a methodical perspective and with<br/>&gt; a practicable goal and specific focus. Back then, when I once could<br/>&gt; not resist the urge to name a comma I calculated after myself, I was<br/>&gt; chastised to remember that it is others who rightly name things after<br/>&gt; you and render you any recognition if you are indeed worthy of it.<br/>&gt; That was then...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who has the power here? Obviously the common mentality and good sense<br/>&gt; that dominates the list. I truly wish it is not anymore the slipshod<br/>&gt; undisciplined pretentious attitude that has blown like a scourge for<br/>&gt; the past year hereabouts. And if need be, measures should be taken to<br/>&gt; keep such a devastating, crippling, mass-inducing habit in check.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have noticed with great dismay that Carl is very much slipping in<br/>&gt; moderation. No personal offence inteded to him! It&apos;s a simple matter<br/>&gt; to get carried away in the wake of such carefree anarchistic trends as<br/>&gt; we face today. And he is a family man with distractions of his own. As<br/>&gt; such, I strongly believe a change of office is in order.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My concern has never been about PhD titles and ranks. It&apos;s always been<br/>&gt; an issue of clarity, understandability, proper conduct and unambiguous<br/>&gt; purpose when sending messages to everyone.

Carl went on a bit but, instead of playing high and mighty<br/>&gt; &gt; and running the line of &quot;I can get away with anything b/c I&apos;m the<br/>&gt; &gt; moderator&quot;, he apologized and, if anything, he should be commended<br/>&gt; &gt; for his action there.

Lord knows we have had enough instances on this list<br/>&gt; &gt; where two experts are calling each others&apos; theories circular.  :-D<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     The other issue has to do with &quot;scholarly-ness&quot;.  For sure this<br/>&gt; &gt; list lacks from time to time in displaying topics with PHD-level<br/>&gt; &gt; academic formality that would keep up with, for example, Ozan/&quot;your&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; own work or the work of someone like Margo or Carl.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   Then again the Tuning list advertises itself as being open to<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;anyone interested in tuning&quot;, which would include people like<br/>&gt; &gt; myself, Chris, Sevish, Rick Ballan, and several others who aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning PHD&apos;s and may or may not &quot;even&quot; have or be working on college<br/>&gt; &gt; level music degrees.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;   I wish the list were separated into<br/>&gt; &gt; 1) Tuning-papers for working on academic-level publications<br/>&gt; &gt; 2) Tuning-general for those who are simply interested in micro-<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning and anything that goes too far into theory to post on the MMM<br/>&gt; &gt; list (which is how I found about this list in the first place,<br/>&gt; &gt; someone said &quot;Mike, this level of theory belongs on the tuning list&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    That way we could avoid things like PHD&apos;s calling &quot;mere&quot; music<br/>&gt; &gt; hobbyists &quot;dumb and pointless&quot; simply because they aren&apos;t on the<br/>&gt; &gt; same level and/or non-PHD&apos;s complaining that academic papers are &quot;a<br/>&gt; &gt; lot of overly-complex talk and very little actual music (IE isn&apos;t it<br/>&gt; &gt; amazing someone can say my theories have nothing to do with tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; and then say they love a song I made based on those theories?!)&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    All in all...I figure something like a split would mean less<br/>&gt; &gt; fighting over content and wasting space complaining about who does/<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn&apos;t &quot;deserve to post&quot;.

Only lately have I<br/>&gt; experimented with more active moderation.  But it hasn&apos;t<br/>&gt; done much good.  A policy&apos;s success depends upon the portion<br/>&gt; of people who approve of it.  Last time we discussed active<br/>&gt; moderation, the consensus was clearly against it (I was in<br/>&gt; favor).

I remember your posts<br/>&gt; about revolutionizing maqam music with extended JI polyphony,<br/>&gt; an automatic piano tuning apparatus, and frequent back and<br/>&gt; forth with Gene as you were working on scales for your thesis.<br/>&gt; At times I know Gene and I felt we were going around in<br/>&gt; circles, because your requirements seemed to change often.<br/>&gt; Please understand, I think of you as a well-adjusted person,<br/>&gt; and I would not say the same for every name you mentioned.<br/>&gt; I am only trying to give some perspective.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I have noticed with great dismay that Carl is very much<br/>&gt;&gt; slipping in moderation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the record, we have 3 moderators plus one list owner:<br/>&gt; Gene Ward Smith, David Bowen, myself, and Mark Nowitzky.<br/>&gt; We didn&apos;t used to have moderators.

For sure this<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; list lacks from time to time in displaying topics with PHD-level<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; academic formality that would keep up with, for example, Ozan/&quot;your&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; own work or the work of someone like Margo or Carl.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Then again the Tuning list advertises itself as being open to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;anyone interested in tuning&quot;, which would include people like<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; myself, Chris, Sevish, Rick Ballan, and several others who aren&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; tuning PHD&apos;s and may or may not &quot;even&quot; have or be working on college<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; level music degrees.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I wish the list were separated into<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) Tuning-papers for working on academic-level publications<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Tuning-general for those who are simply interested in micro-<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; tuning and anything that goes too far into theory to post on the MMM<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; list (which is how I found about this list in the first place,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; someone said &quot;Mike, this level of theory belongs on the tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; list&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;   That way we could avoid things like PHD&apos;s calling &quot;mere&quot; music<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; hobbyists &quot;dumb and pointless&quot; simply because they aren&apos;t on the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; same level and/or non-PHD&apos;s complaining that academic papers are &quot;a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; lot of overly-complex talk and very little actual music (IE isn&apos;t it<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; amazing someone can say my theories have nothing to do with tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and then say they love a song I made based on those theories?!)&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;   All in all...I figure something like a split would mean less<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; fighting over content and wasting space complaining about who does/<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn&apos;t &quot;deserve to post&quot;.   Honestly, I think the mere fact we have<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; people complaining many people honestly interested in tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; shouldn&apos;t have the freedom to post shows this is a problem we need<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; to resolve.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;If I feel TL rises to a worthy level again, I  promise to be extra<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; careful with the subject lines!&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;   I am happy Carl broke the ice on this issue, because I&apos;ve fallen<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; into that hole as well.  After having so many people de-rail my own<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; topics and not take them seriously (and trying to post new topics<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; based on my take on other people&apos;s quote only to have them be<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ignored), I figured why bother keeping strict standards for my<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; replies to other people&apos;s threads.  But hey, if other people are<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; willing to take this seriously, so am I!<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

Also, I encourage you to note that most of us<br/>&gt; &quot;juvenile delinquents&quot; have acknowledged and apologized for the<br/>&gt; excessive nature of our recent posts, and pledged to reduce them in<br/>&gt; the future.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is my sincere hope that as the message count returns to normal,<br/>&gt; you may again find the space and freedom you desire, so that you may<br/>&gt; again find the list useful for your purposes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And let us all give thanks that our benighted moderator has shown<br/>&gt; the good sense to banish a true bane to our field from this list<br/>&gt; (though I&apos;m sure the members of MMM are not so thankful).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let us now end this irrelevant discussion, content that compromise<br/>&gt; has been reached (given that you have my pledge to keep the post-<br/>&gt; count down and the focus and relevance up).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Respectfully,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igliashon<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/22/2010 12:40:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;                             Dr. Yarman:<br/>While it is reassuring to know that I have not tried your patience sufficiently<br/>that you&apos;ve seen fit to filter my posts, I do not appreciate being referred to<br/>as a &quot;JI hobbyist&quot;, nor do I appreciate the implication that I am a juvenile<br/>delinquent.&quot;<br/>  Ditto for me in the past.  A side note, must of us are not just focused on JI,<br/>and at least also have a foot in temperament.  Many others also have a foot in<br/>psychoacoustics and several more in sound programming...and I&apos;ll be if you can<br/>call someone with interest in many of such things a &quot;juvenile&quot;: that&apos;s about so<br/>likely as having a high schooler in a math competition club not learn basic<br/>algebra along the way or be serious about math.</p><p>&gt;&quot;While Mike B.&apos;s posts on the matter (and my replies to them, as well as Carl&apos;s)<br/>&gt;reached great heights of prolixity, his attitude was always one of seeking the<br/>&gt;&quot;collective wisdom&quot; of the list, always saying &quot;I have experienced this<br/>&gt;phenomenon, and I have developed this hypothesis, but I request your feedback<br/>&gt;and criticism.&quot;<br/>  Exactly!  Same holds for so many of us...stating a lot of &quot;maybes&quot;, but always<br/>in search of a definitive answer...even if the process and answer is not<br/>immediate.</p><p>&gt;&quot;And let us all give thanks that our benighted moderator has shown the good<br/>&gt;sense to banish a true bane to our field from this list (though I&apos;m sure the<br/>&gt;members of MMM are not so thankful).&quot;<br/>   Oh man...since when should we celebrate such a thing...aren&apos;t we supposed to<br/>be trying to increase public interest in tuning?!</p><p>    There are people on this list I often think go too far in &quot;giving an answer<br/>and not asking for or accepting constructive criticism&quot; about things...but is it<br/>really that hard for people on this list to simply ignore such people if you<br/>don&apos;t like their comments and act like an adult about it?  Doing otherwise is<br/>like a company saying &quot;I won&apos;t hire you&quot; and then going to nearly every company<br/>in the city and telling them what they &quot;think&quot; is wrong with that person (as<br/>if...if that person is wrong for them that person must also be wrong for<br/>everyone else).<br/>    Even if there were a &quot;Kindergartner&quot; or true &quot;Troll&quot; on the list, surely<br/>that person would lose interest if he saw his responses not being reacted to<br/>and/or given a slight brush off statement like &quot;I&apos;m simply not interested in<br/>responding to this&quot; and no more.  If no one truly is interested...the person<br/>won&apos;t get a response and will eventually leave or at least post much less<br/>often.  Enough with the &quot;Holy Wars&quot; on this, there&apos;s nothing Holy about them...</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2010 11:18:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, David Beardsley &lt;db@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I remember thinking it went back to &apos;93 at least, but I realize<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t actually know.
