I hope you give us a report on it.<br/>(from Gene Ward Smith, 11 juillet 2005)</p><p>Hi all,<br/>Thanks Gene &amp; Yahya for your friendly thougths,<br/>This 3-days workshop were indeed filled with happiness.<br/>We had 13 participants among which 2 ladies, which I think is a performance<br/>(what is the percentage of ladies among the tuning list subscribers today ?<br/>;)<br/>Sorry, no proceedings, no report on internet...<br/>AEH has many written ressources, but almost all in french.<br/>Nothing secret in our work, but no time to do it, as I have to prepare our<br/>next annual main festival, &quot;Les Noces Harmoniques&quot; (25-26-27-28 of august<br/>2005 - by the way open to microtonal travelers from the whole world).</p><p>In brief, something like 28 tunings for keybords and guitars were studied,<br/>about all on traditional models, along with of course a maximum of basics.<br/>Among the many nice things we did not expected, a young man, Nicolas Escot,<br/>arrived from Paris (900 kms) with a spanish guitar refretted in a 17-limit<br/>system of his own, all well done with curved frets and good sound.<br/>So as an introduction in hearing the 17th harmonic in a simple 17-limit<br/>scale I proposed my prefered (Dudon) version of morning raga Bhairav :<br/>1/1  17/16  5/4  4/3  3/2  51/32  15/8  2/1<br/>(which can have a few double notes as well)<br/>Then (after the guitar passed from hand to hand and was judged &quot;very<br/>circular&quot; by all the present guitar players), we studied the vectorial<br/>structure of Nicolas&apos;s guitar, which was based on a cycle of pure fifths<br/>between F and B, with two 17/16 up from F &amp; C and three 17/16 down from A,<br/>E, B :</p><p>1/1  17/16  9/8  81/68  81/64  729/544  729/512  3/2  51/32  27/16  243/136<br/>243/128<br/>(with 1/1 = F of the guitar, tuned in the standard tuning E A D G B E)<br/>If any one has any comment on it, I will be glad to transmit to Nicolas.<br/>My comment was that it was certainly a very circular tuning, even may be too<br/>much. The three less-than 3/2 fifths C# G#, E F# &amp; A# F are very acceptable,<br/>but I found the three best approaching natural major thirds (by 64/51) could<br/>have an improved &quot;guitaristic&quot; situation.<br/>After a quick look this can be done by using 27/17 instead of 51/32 :<br/>1/1  17/16  9/8  81/68  81/64  729/544  729/512  3/2  27/17  27/16  243/136<br/>243/128 and having either A or D on 243/128 instead of E - then A or D have<br/>an optimized diatonic major scale, which might be some of the best choices<br/>on a standard E A D G B E guitar tuning ?<br/>I need some classical guitarist&apos;s lights on the subject.</p><p>Apart from this and many other questions, one question was left without<br/>definitive answer inside the workshop timings :<br/>How to tune african heptatonic instruments like cora and balafons ?<br/>(without using 8 or 9 notes by octave ! ;)<br/>Same question, by the way, with a celtic harp...</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Jacques Dudon<br/>Atelier d&apos;Exploration Harmonique - Les Camails 83340 LE THORONET<br/>tel &amp; fax 04 94 73 87 78   -  tel &amp; r&eacute;pondeur 04 94 73 80 25<br/><a href="mailto:fotosonix@wanadoo.fr">fotosonix@wanadoo.fr</a><br/><a href="http://aeh.free.fr">http://aeh.free.fr</a></p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2005 1:40:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacques Dudon (AEH)&quot; &lt;fotosonix@w...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Apart from this and many other questions, one question was left<br/>without<br/>&gt; definitive answer inside the workshop timings :<br/>&gt; How to tune african heptatonic instruments like cora and balafons ?<br/>&gt; (without using 8 or 9 notes by octave ! ;)<br/>&gt; Same question, by the way, with a celtic harp...</p><p>My answer for the string instruments, of course, is meantone tuning<br/>(in general, not necessarily the 1/4-comma version). In the West,<br/>what we call meantone today was simply called &quot;correct intonation&quot; by<br/>musicians for two or three centuries, including most of the<br/>Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical periods. So it would be<br/>historically quite appropriate for much Celtic harp music. When I<br/>play diatonic music on my 31-equal guitar (a fine representative of<br/>the meantone &apos;family&apos;), I&apos;m enchanted by the peaceful purity of the<br/>intervals and chords, and it&apos;s very difficult indeed for my ears to<br/>accept a rather different 7-note diatonic tuning (whether 12-equal or<br/>5-limit JI), with its attendant harsh intervals, immediately<br/>thereafter.</p><p>The Kora/cora is an instrument I love dearly, there being some<br/>virtuoso players who&apos;ve moved from Africa to the Boston area, and<br/>though certainly not Western, I&apos;ve been surprised to find that they<br/>are definitely tuned with meantone tendencies -- even when playing<br/>along with 12-equal Western instruments. I don&apos;t claim this is<br/>universal for kora tuning, but the particular style, perhaps<br/>consciously &quot;world-music&quot; oriented, that finds itself represented by<br/>African musicians on the Boston streets and clubs seems to gravitate<br/>towards meantone kora tunings. Being familiar with the sound of<br/>meantone mainly through &quot;authentic&quot; recordings of Renaissance music,<br/>the sound of the Kora makes me imagine a cultural exchange of<br/>troubadours between Europe and Africa during the 16th century, the<br/>gut strings and fluid polyphony of the Kora being oddly reminiscent<br/>of the sound of lute music.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t expect to find a *regular* meantone tuning on a Kora, an<br/>instrument which is tuned by ear frequently during performance (most<br/>often only one note per octave is retuned, to effect a different<br/>diatonic scale one step away on the chain of fifths, but overall<br/>tuning corrections seem necessary every few songs or so since the<br/>instrument is not built with locking tuners). But the players I&apos;ve<br/>heard tune so that all the thirds and sixths in the diatonic scale<br/>are closer to pure than they could be in a JI (by Dave&apos;s definition)<br/>scale, so the indication is definitely that some kind of (perhaps<br/>irregular) meantone tuning is being used.</p><p>Of course, it&apos;s quite possible to specify such tunings using high-<br/>limit ratios, as Kirnberger and others were fond of doing, and as<br/>Jacques Dudon&apos;s rotating discs might require one to do. Erv Wilson&apos;s<br/>writings on meta-meantone provide just one way in which a regular<br/>meantone tuning can be seen as the limit of a series of rational<br/>scales defined by a simple recurrence relation. Meta-meantone is a<br/>flavor of meantone with quite narrow perfect fifths (and wide perfect<br/>fourths), and a rational scale with numbers as small as</p><p>75   112   167   250   374   558   834,</p><p>after reducing to one octave, gives a fairly good realization of a<br/>meta-meantone diatonic:</p><p>            0 cents<br/>       125.64 cents<br/>        311.5 cents<br/>       507.33 cents<br/>       695.74 cents<br/>       819.88 cents<br/>         1010 cents</p><p>For other varieties of meantone with fifths and fourths closer to<br/>pure, one can find other recurrence relations which produce other<br/>series of integers that similarly converge to the meantone fairly<br/>quickly. Gene Ward Smith has written about this topic before and will<br/>probably do so again . . .</p><p>As for the tuning of the balafon, and the many other traditions of<br/>kora tuning that one may find in Africa, I recommend reading this<br/>webpage:</p><p><a href="http://tcd.freehosting.net/djembemande/bala.html">http://tcd.freehosting.net/djembemande/bala.html</a></p><p>I&apos;m also fascinated by other African tunings, such as the Chopi<br/>tunings Erv Wilson refers to as &quot;Mavila&quot;.

Being familiar with the sound of<br/>&gt; meantone mainly through &quot;authentic&quot; recordings of Renaissance music,<br/>&gt; the sound of the Kora makes me imagine a cultural exchange of<br/>&gt; troubadours between Europe and Africa during the 16th century, the<br/>&gt; gut strings and fluid polyphony of the Kora being oddly reminiscent<br/>&gt; of the sound of lute music.</p><p>[YA]<br/>Is there any evidence of such an exchange, I wonder?</p><p>I imagine cultural exchanges between Arabic and African musicians,<br/>along trade routes both across the continent from Egypt to the Niger<br/>and Timbuktu, and down the eastern coast and Rift Valley to Zanzibar.<br/>Moreover, such exchanges would have occurred over a very long period.</p><p>However, if meantones were part of such exchanges, I would expect<br/>them to have travelled from Africa to Arabia rather than the reverse.<br/>My reasoning is that stringed instruments - more prevalent in Arabia<br/>than in Africa - are easier to tune accurately by measurement than are<br/>either pipes or idiophones.  And many simple end-blown flutes I&apos;ve seen<br/>(I still have a couple) have apparently been tuned by boring equidistant<br/>finger holes in the compass of the lower fourth of the flute, thus making<br/>the first two (approximate) whole tones nearly equal.  But I hasten to<br/>add that I&apos;m only speculating here.</p><p>&gt; I wouldn&apos;t expect to find a *regular* meantone tuning on a Kora, an<br/>&gt; instrument which is tuned by ear frequently during performance (most<br/>&gt; often only one note per octave is retuned, to effect a different<br/>&gt; diatonic scale one step away on the chain of fifths, ...</p><p>[YA]<br/>Interesting observation!  Seems a practical way to add some variety<br/>without taking too long over it.

But the players I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; heard tune so that all the thirds and sixths in the diatonic scale<br/>&gt; are closer to pure than they could be in a JI (by Dave&apos;s definition)<br/>&gt; scale, so the indication is definitely that some kind of (perhaps<br/>&gt; irregular) meantone tuning is being used.</p><p>[YA]<br/>Hmmm ... &quot;thirds ... closer to pure than they could be in a JI&quot; ???<br/>What could be purer than an exact ratio?

Diatonic scales where the semitone is less<br/>than half the size of the whole tone are melodically delicious;<br/>surely they have enough historical and/or geographical significance<br/>to belong on this continuum?</p><p>&gt; 2) Next to diatonic I place some of the main Burmese scales, with<br/>semitones<br/>&gt; slightly larger than 16/15<br/>&gt; 3) Then some type of common final for Rast (in Arab music, not the<br/>turkish<br/>&gt; Rast) which is a Rast whose neutral thirds over the tonic become<br/>major<br/>&gt; 4) Then 13-limit kind of diatonic scales (Persian music, also Gnawa)<br/>&gt; 5) Then the semidiatonic neutral Rast family<br/>&gt; 6) Then but with a different structure the semidiatonic Mohajira<br/>family,<br/>&gt; sligthly more circular ;<br/>&gt; 7) Then a very diffuse family using the 10/9 type of intervals as<br/>largest<br/>&gt; tones and still one or two semitones of the 12/11 type ;<br/>&gt; 8) Then the Tha&iuml; or (almost)-equiheptatonic family, where the<br/>smallest type<br/>&gt; of tone is no smaller than 11/10.

I am playing on that : how, when you<br/>double two of the notes of a slendro (one fourth apart) by a comma or so,<br/>you start to have this diatonic feeling, with the sensible and tonic almost<br/>united ... then at some point you don&apos;t know if you are in a pentatonic or<br/>heptatonic system, and I love that.</p><p>&gt;&gt; 2) Next to diatonic I place some of the main Burmese scales, with<br/>&gt;&gt; semitones slightly larger than 16/15<br/>&gt;&gt; 3) Then some type of common final for Rast (in Arab music, not the<br/>&gt;&gt; turkish Rast) which is a Rast whose neutral thirds over the tonic become<br/>&gt;&gt; major<br/>&gt;&gt; 4) Then 13-limit kind of diatonic scales (Persian music, also Gnawa)<br/>&gt;&gt; 5) Then the semidiatonic neutral Rast family<br/>&gt;&gt; 6) Then but with a different structure the semidiatonic Mohajira<br/>&gt;&gt; family, sligthly more circular ;<br/>&gt;&gt; 7) Then a very diffuse family using the 10/9 type of intervals as<br/>&gt;&gt; largest tones and still one or two semitones of the 12/11 type ;<br/>&gt;&gt; 8) Then the Tha&iuml; or (almost)-equiheptatonic family, where the<br/>&gt;&gt; smallest type<br/>&gt;&gt; of tone is no smaller than 11/10. Besides, semitone sensation<br/>&gt;&gt; becomes rare in a Tha&iuml; scale.<br/>&gt;&gt; 9) In the end, an exactly-equal tempered heptaphone is more<br/>&gt;&gt; theorical but can exist as a tuning tendency.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cool . . .

I really love<br/>&gt; playing with these kinds of scales; the pentatonics are wonderfully<br/>&gt; flavorful, with a much enhanced differentiation between small and<br/>&gt; large pentatonic step sizes, and standard triadic harmonic<br/>&gt; habits &quot;work&quot; but with minor-sounding triads where you&apos;d expect major<br/>&gt; and vice versa.</p><p>Yes !

We&apos;ve been using the term &quot;Superpythagorean&quot; to mean that<br/>&gt; the minor seconds are smaller, and the major seconds larger, than in<br/>&gt; Pythagorean. And sometimes the Superpythagorean appelation<br/>&gt; specifically indicates that 64:63 is tempered out, so that stacking<br/>&gt; three (4:3) fourths approximates a 7:3, etc. . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s worth noting that &quot;diatonic&quot; means &quot;through the tones&quot;, the<br/>&gt; prefix &quot;dia-&quot; meaning through. It does *not* mean &quot;two tones&quot; -- that<br/>&gt; would be &quot;ditonic&quot;, not &quot;diatonic&quot;.<br/>Yes I know. I think &quot;hyperdiatonics&quot; was inspired to me by &quot;Divisions of the<br/>Tetrachord&quot; by John Chalmers, who mentions &quot;Hyperenharmonic&quot; from Erv Wilson<br/>(56/55 55/54 9/7) - I like &quot;hyperdiatonics&quot;, being on the opposite side of<br/>&quot;semidiatonics&quot;, that we all know.<br/>Besides, but that&apos;s my own feeling, I would rather leave Pythagoras, who is<br/>beyond all that, and even beyond the 3-limit, out any stuff he was not for<br/>sure specially into.</p><p>&gt;&gt; then at some point you don&apos;t know if you are in a pentatonic or<br/>&gt;&gt; heptatonic system, and I love that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cool! How can I hear this ?</p><p>In any Indonesian Gamelan in slendro tuning with bars a little distuned<br/>between different instruments, wherever you happen to catch a &quot;semitone<br/>feeling&quot;, that&apos;s it ! then you have an hexatonic, and if you hear another<br/>semitone you have good chances to be in front of some kind of a<br/>&quot;hyperdiatonic&quot; !<br/>ex : slendro 1 2 3 5 6 &gt; add one comma under 1 &amp; the other over 3 =<br/>hyperdiatonic from 1<br/>If you want a precise exemple, take a &quot;S-J&quot; (Dudon) slendro :<br/>21  3  55  63  9   and add 165 &amp; 7 = hyperdiatonic from 21<br/>This is the contrary of &quot;tempering out&quot;, I guess.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Cool . . . I see this isn&apos;t a smooth progression of levels (Manuel<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; has Mohajira as 3+4+3+4+3+4+3 in 24-equal),<br/>this must be the Egyptian version then ! ;)</p><p>&gt; BTW, I know I&apos;ve asked you before, but where did you get the<br/>&gt; name &quot;Mohajira&quot; and its association to particular scales?<br/>Mohajira is an arabian word that means &quot;migratory&quot;. That was the first<br/>feeling I got when I discovered it, trying the different modes of a 13-limit<br/>Mohajira and finding they were reminding me, in my sense, of many different<br/>cultures : arabian, persian, malagasy, even celtic sometimes ...<br/>Mohajira is basically formed by the succession of six neutral thirds.<br/>The two extremities are then, octave-reduced, one minor third apart.<br/>That is why it is one step more circular than Rast, who has 1 major third,<br/>2 minor thirds, and four neutral thirds.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; but in the spirit of what<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; you&apos;ve proposed, I would be tempted to &quot;continue&quot; on &quot;beyond&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; equiheptatonic scales to heptatonic scales with two large steps<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and five small steps, in the reverse of the diatonic pattern.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; The &quot;Mavila&quot; scale of the Chopi (SW Africa) shows this pattern;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and more blatantly, the Pelog tunings of Indonesia do. I really love<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; playing with these kinds of scales; the pentatonics are<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; wonderfully<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; flavorful, with a much enhanced differentiation between small and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; large pentatonic step sizes, and standard triadic harmonic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; habits &quot;work&quot; but with minor-sounding triads where you&apos;d expect<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; major and vice versa.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Yes ! I don&apos;t know the &quot;Mavila&quot; Scale,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll let Kraig respond to this before I try to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; but the tendency is already potential<br/>&gt;&gt; in what I mentionned rapidly in my 7th family, where from a Tha&iuml;<br/>&gt;&gt; scale you<br/>&gt;&gt; trade two &quot;11/10&quot; for another &quot;10/9&quot; and one &quot;12/11&quot;, or like in<br/>&gt;&gt; other &quot;Rast-attracted&quot; Tha&iuml; scales.<br/>&gt;&gt; Defective pentatonics from these scales are numerous, and I place<br/>&gt;&gt; the delicate Gnawa scales in that family too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you elaborate? Haven&apos;t heard of Gnawa, and I don&apos;t know what you<br/>&gt; mean by &quot;defective pentatonics&quot;. I was referring to pentatonics like<br/>&gt; 1+1+3+1+3 in 9-equal, for example, a very Pelog-like scale, where the<br/>&gt; encapsulating &quot;Pelog tuning&quot; would be 1+1+2+1+1+1+2.</p><p>I was thinking of that too, but rather in non-equal 9.<br/>The Gnawa are an ethnical brotherhood living nowadays mostly in Marocco, who<br/>used to be slaves from Sudan. Their main instruments are the guimbri (or<br/>Hajhouj), a 3-trings bass lute with skin, and the qarqabat (plur. qaraqeb),<br/>kind of iron castanets, plus various drums. Their music is known to be part<br/>of a healing ritual, the Lila, that lasts during the whole night.<br/>The qaraqeb plays some kind of strange polyrythm between 3 and for 4 beats<br/>per cycle, while they sing on some pentatonic scale that could be<br/>interpreted as a 2+3+2+3+2 form, with the guimbri producing extatic bass<br/>accompaniment. However, I found that the scale they played had rather often<br/>a defective-Mohajira tendency (Mohajira with two notes ommited) : for<br/>exemple a 4+7+3+7+3 form,<br/>which could also be considered as a modal form of a 7+3+4+7+3 Pelog</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; There are also other distributionally even heptatonic scales in<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; my &quot;Middle Path&quot; paper that, like Mohajira, don&apos;t have this 5+2 or<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+5 distribution of step sizes; but I&apos;m not sure how far afield<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; you&apos;d like to go with this topic . . .<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Well, all this is inspiring, even if I should be entering into more<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;organisation work&quot; now untill the end of august, for our music<br/>&gt;&gt; festival...<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Where do we find your writtings ?</p><p>&gt; Many of them are available through this page:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lumma.org/tuning/erlich/">http://www.lumma.org/tuning/erlich/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but the more recent &quot;Middle Path&quot; paper I&apos;m referring to is one I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; been snail-mailing out instead.

Yet this system<br/>arises *entirely* from JI by tempering out a certain group of commas<br/>while doing the least possible damage to the concordance of the<br/>underlying JI ratios. Hopefully my paper will help make this clear.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Cool . . . I see this isn&apos;t a smooth progression of levels<br/>(Manuel<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; has Mohajira as 3+4+3+4+3+4+3 in 24-equal),<br/>&gt; this must be the Egyptian version then ! ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; BTW, I know I&apos;ve asked you before, but where did you get the<br/>&gt; &gt; name &quot;Mohajira&quot; and its association to particular scales?<br/>&gt; Mohajira is an arabian word that means &quot;migratory&quot;. That was the<br/>first<br/>&gt; feeling I got when I discovered it,</p><p>So Manuel got it from you then . . . very interesting.</p><p>&gt; trying the different modes of a 13-limit<br/>&gt; Mohajira and finding they were reminding me, in my sense, of many<br/>different<br/>&gt; cultures : arabian, persian, malagasy, even celtic sometimes ...<br/>&gt; Mohajira is basically formed by the succession of six neutral<br/>thirds.</p><p>Yes; the scale has come up many times on this list; for example<br/>Blackjack is composed of 3 interlaced Mohajira scales (the Blackjack<br/>generator being 1/3 of a neutral third and the period being an<br/>octave). In the paper I&apos;m sending you, you&apos;ll see a few different<br/>scales fitting this description: Beatles[7] =<br/>133+222+133+222+133+222+133, and Dicot[7] =<br/>148+205+148+205+148+205+148. These are derived as temperaments of 7-<br/>limit and 5-limit JI, respectively . . . the 11-limit and 13-limit<br/>cases are going to have to wait for future parts of the paper (what<br/>I&apos;m sending you is actually only part 1). On the tuning-math list,<br/>there has been some discussion of 11-limit and 13-limit temperaments,<br/>and I believe a few of the significant ones had a neutral third<br/>generator and octave period. Any of these temperaments can be taken<br/>as a starting point for deriving a whole host of JI scales,<br/>via &quot;detempering&quot; . . . so I believe the math has value even for<br/>those who wish to stick with a pure form of JI.</p></div><h3>Jacques Dudon (AEH) &#x3C;fotosonix@wanadoo.fr&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2005 7:13:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>le 1/08/05 21:26, wallyesterpaulrus &agrave; <a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a> a &eacute;crit&nbsp;:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW, I know I&apos;ve asked you before, but where did you get the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; name &quot;Mohajira&quot; and its association to particular scales?<br/>&gt;&gt; Mohajira is an arabian word that means &quot;migratory&quot;.

It is kind of neat the way it shows diatonics with<br/>&gt; an LLs (Large Large small) permutation and chromatics and enharmonics<br/>&gt; with an ssL permutation (the common forms of each) by keeping them in<br/>&gt; a straight line. But other permutations are certainly used. For<br/>&gt; example the Byzantine soft and hard chromatics are sLs, and their<br/>&gt; &quot;hyperdiatonics&quot; occur as both LsL and sLL and their diatonics as LLs<br/>&gt; and sLL.<br/>definitively.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Anyway, the main interest of my diagramm, besides proposing a linear<br/>&gt;&gt; classification (that can be completed), is in pointing the<br/>&gt;&gt; aliquot/arithmetic divisions of many classical tetrachords. Thus it<br/>&gt;&gt; aplies rather to a JI concept than to equal-divisions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK. But how much might this be due simply to the use of rational<br/>&gt; arithmetic (which has been much simpler than using logarithmic<br/>&gt; measures until fairly recently) in specifying what is intended merely<br/>&gt; as a division into two approximately equal parts for purely melodic<br/>&gt; (not harmonic) reasons ?</p><p>Who knows, but it has been pointed that scholars were only trying, with such<br/>methods as ratios or aliquot divisions on a monochord, to reproduce what<br/>they were hearing in popular music. Personnally, I don&apos;t see why melodic<br/>lines would be &quot;approximate&quot; or of &quot;approximately equal&quot; intonations either.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In the example you give of a non-fitting tetrachord (4+10+16 and<br/>&gt;&gt; permutations), what are the three intervals that define 4, 10, and 16 ?<br/>&gt;&gt; 25/24, 11/10 and 7/6 ? then the product is not exactly 4/3 and I<br/>&gt;&gt; don&apos;t know<br/>&gt;&gt; why I would want to fit this tetrachord in this aliquot/arithmetic<br/>&gt;&gt; system.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you insist that it be specified with rational arithmetic, then it<br/>&gt; could be 240/231, 11/10, 7/6.<br/>ahhhh ! my *archa&iuml;c* rational instincts are satisfied now... :-)</p><p>&gt; 25/24 is only one ratio that is approximated by 4 twelfthtones. 28/27<br/>&gt; is another common one, but I decided to only list one representative<br/>&gt; ratio for each step, on the diagram.<br/>sure.<br/>I noticed degrees 1, 2, 3, 29 are left blank, may be by lack of space for<br/>the digits, or because of too much choices ? but could not you risk to<br/>choose the more common intervals you find between all others, or was it too<br/>complex ?</p><p>&gt; You could also consider the permutations of the examples<br/>&gt; 5 10 15  (104/99 11/10  15/13) or<br/>&gt; 3 10 16  (40/39  11/10  13/11)<br/>&gt; which cause similar difficulties for a simple-minded extension of your<br/>&gt; system to 2 dimensions.</p><p>absolutely.</p><p>&gt; I note that 104/99 is very close to 21/20.<br/>a lovely 2080/2079  13-limit skisma</p><p>&gt;&gt; The only thing we can say is that the upper order (10+16+4 or<br/>&gt;&gt; 16+10+4) seems<br/>&gt;&gt; closer to the aliquot/arithmetic divisions, so could be related in<br/>&gt;&gt; priority to line 32/25 - may be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure I understand the meaning of &quot;aliquot&quot; and &quot;arithmetic&quot; in<br/>&gt; this context. Or the significance of them in classifying tetrachords.<br/>In this context it has not much meaning. I was just figuring out the shorter<br/>distance to the aliquot or arithmetic lines, since this is the logic of my<br/>diagramm - for each of your three solutions. So if a choice had to be done,<br/>this could have been one.<br/>For rather harmonic reasons, if you had said the tetrachord was 25/24,<br/>192/175, 7/6, I would have ranged it also in line 32/25. Now if you say that<br/>the three intervals are 240/231, 11/10, 7/6, I am even more embarrassed...<br/>And I will not try to range a contrabass in a violin box.</p><p>The significance of these aliquot and arithmetic divisions in classifying<br/>tetrachords, is only based on the observation that a significant number of<br/>tetrachords mentionned by the ancients share this property to show an<br/>aliquot or arithmetic division somewhere between consecutive intervals.<br/>What I just did, for pedagogical purpose, is to put those in order along a<br/>vertical axis (the vertical sides of the square do not intend to be 1/1 and<br/>all four notes can serve as reference notes).<br/>Now I am quite satisfied to have BOTH aliquot and arithmetic divisions and<br/>the resulting commas on each tetrachord line, because these precise<br/>permutations and the modulations they offer have strong musical sense.<br/>This is how you pass &quot;through the mirror&quot; from harmonics to subharmonics, or<br/>from a minor to a major mode, see for example how a simple 9/8 &gt; 10/9<br/>(81/80) mutation on the 5/4 line reverses the scale, and changes the tonic<br/>from C major to A minor, etc.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I have to plunge deeper in &quot;TetrachordChart4&quot;, but at a first glance<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; understand why you place chromatics and enharmonics near the top of the<br/>&gt;&gt; square, because of permutations may be ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. It is so that if any tetrachord is classified as chromatic, then<br/>&gt; so are all its permutations. The same for enharmonic or diatonic. The<br/>&gt; same for proper, improper or pentatonic. Presumably one then uses mode<br/>&gt; names like Lydian, Myxolydian, Phrygian etc. to differentiate the<br/>&gt; permutations, although I haven&apos;t got that part worked out yet. I<br/>&gt; probably should just buy a copy of John Chalmers&apos; book. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- Dave Keenan</p><p>Congratulations, if you don&apos;t even have John Chalmers&apos; book, to be able to<br/>explain the extension of my diagramm into his system like you did.
