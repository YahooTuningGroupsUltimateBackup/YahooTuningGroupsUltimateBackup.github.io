This seems<br/>to me a possible disservice.</p><p>    It is a truism that bad press is better than none at all. I totally<br/>disagree and experience has shown that this is not the case. I want to<br/>know how much bad press they have had to bear. The bad press i have<br/>gotten has done nothing but fostered misunderstanding and implied i did<br/>things I do not. It might have been true at one time. Frankly if someone<br/>did the same to me on this list I would be quite upset. Maybe the<br/>problem is in the first post Subject. Maybe it was supposed to be funny.</p><p>Another question this brings up is the animals referred to as<br/>&quot;Reviewers&quot; (Differing from interviewers or writers of previews etc.).<br/>Do we need them? do they really tell us any thing especially if they are<br/>bad. When good they can direct our attention to aspects we are<br/>overlooking, but if they are bad , what is gained outside of the writer<br/>getting paid to state they don&apos;t understand what is going on. In my<br/>overly personal view, i think reviews are useful to helping others<br/>understand someone&apos;s work, If this is not possible i think silence is<br/>better than a bad review.</p><p>I only read review when i miss a concert that i didn&apos;t know was<br/>happening and frankly i only care about what it is they did and am glad<br/>if the reviewer liked it, if they didn&apos;t like it, i could really care<br/>less!</p><p>Maybe things are different in New York. It is well known in L.A. that<br/>you will not get reviewed if you do not buy advertising for your<br/>concerts. Why and how can you take such a thing seriously.</p><p><a href="mailto:JSZANTO@ADNC.COM">JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Um, Kraig...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Just kidding<br/>&gt; &gt; I chose this as a subject to illustrate  the tastelessness of<br/>&gt; repeating<br/>&gt; &gt; the below as a subject title.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You know, don&apos;t you, that for eons mailing lists have maintained a<br/>&gt; particular paradigm, known as &quot;threads&quot;. The first message starts<br/>&gt; with a subject, and any replies to it (and, in a *well programmed<br/>&gt; mailing list*, the replies to the replies) will prepend &quot;Re: &quot; to<br/>&gt; that subject matter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The entire reason for this is that if you subscribe in a normal<br/>&gt; manner (i.e. non-digest), you can use your email client to &apos;walk&apos; the<br/>&gt; thread of the subject and all it&apos;s replies, instead of looking at the<br/>&gt; posts as they come in chronologically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is *not* the individual people, writing their messages, who are<br/>&gt; repeating it. You *can* change a subject header by just writing a new<br/>&gt; post, but that defeats the purpose of being able to follow a thread.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And this is from someone who considers Warren a real swell guy!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                    Yahoo!
