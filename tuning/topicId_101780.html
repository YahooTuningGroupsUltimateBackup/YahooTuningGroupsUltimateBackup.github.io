FYI: This is not a definitive decision, I&apos;m inviting others to take part in the discussion about what might be possible better names for some of them and also if we actually want to strip out some of them for whatever reason. For the last two on the list, I have absolutely no idea what to call them so I&apos;m leaving them nameless for this time.</p><p>Trying to make the names contain as much information as possible and at the same time be as short as possible, I&apos;ve often used the &quot;alphanumeric&quot; conversion which some of you may dislike -- i.e. numbers 1 to 26 are converted to letters &quot;a&quot; to &quot;z&quot;. An example of that is &quot;lafa&quot;, which actually means that stacking 12 generators makes 6/1 -- &quot;l&quot; for 12, &quot;f&quot; for 6. If you find this too cryptic, you may suggest otherwise. Also, some of my naming schemes are a bit inconsistent so I&apos;ll be glad if someone else is capable of making some more order in it. :-)</p><p>Note that many of these are also usable as 5-limit temperaments (the one called &quot;ditonic&quot; being a good example), sometimes offering less mistuning than when adjusting towards the higher limit extensions. Therefore, for a lot of them, it&apos;s perfectly okay to tune them as well as possible in the 5-limit context, even if we plan to use those extensions in the end.</p><p>Unless either stated otherwise or the note says (which one of the two?), these are all pairs of patent vals.</p><p>BTW: Once these are classified, I&apos;ll probably switch to wedgies; these EDO pairs make me howl even without wolf fifths. :-D</p><p>--------------------</p><p>15&amp;35: 11-limit - coblack (a counterpart to blacksmith)</p><p>4&amp;95: 13-limit - quinmite (5 steps to a minor tenth)</p><p>15&amp;103: 11-limit - tritriple (-3*3 generators make an OE of 7/1, 3*3*3 of them make an OE of 3/1)</p><p>10&amp;98: 13-limit (possibly without 11/1) - lagaca (12 steps make a 7/3, where &quot;l, g, c&quot; are integers alphabetically converted to letters)</p><p>9&amp;109: 13-limit - kastro (an extention to astro, very good up to the 11-limit meant by the &quot;k&quot;)</p><p>15&amp;167: 11-limit - whoops (an extension to whoosh)</p><p>22&amp;105: 11-limit - sesesix?

A good example for an explanation might be meantone or meanpop; for both of these, the 13-limit is still considered a proper part of the mapping, which actually means that meantone is still &quot;meantone&quot;, no matter if you&apos;re talking about the 5-limit mapping, 7-limit, 11-limit, or 13-limit. However, trying to map higher primes results in extensions which are not normally considered to belong to the actual meantone mapping. Similarly, meanpop is still &quot;meanpop&quot; both in the 11-limit and 13-limit; but not higher. So, if I go back to the new temperaments, I think vishnean could still be called &quot;vishnean&quot; up to the 13-limit but I&apos;m actually not sure what the optimal limit should be for this particular temperament.</p><p>A nice example demonstrating the difference between the highest limit and a possible optimal limit is &quot;kastro&quot; which I think could still be labeled &quot;kastro&quot; as high as in the 13-limit, even though the 13 identity brings significantly more mistuning than all the lower ones do. So I think that an &quot;optimal&quot; limit could be either 7 or 11. At the same time, I still think that the 13-limit extension deserves to be a part of the &quot;kastro&quot; mapping.</p><p>What&apos;s more, for some temperaments, a quest for the optimal limit would mean to take partial limits into account, which would probably turn the entire concept of temperament families on its head. For example, the one I call &quot;maja&quot; (53&amp;61) is perfectly usable either as a 5-limit temperament or as a 2.3.5.13-limit temperament. But once I add 7 or 11 to the mix, the comparable quality of the temperament is debatable. For 7s, using 61p makes the whole thing much more complex while using 61d brings a lot more mistuning. For 11s, the mistuning isn&apos;t so great but it&apos;s still recognizably greater than for the other primes. So now I&apos;m facing the question: While calling the 5-limit temperament &quot;maja&quot; even when adding the 13 identity, should I call the 11-limit one &quot;maja&quot; as well? And what&apos;ll I do about the 7s at all? Similar situations regarding the 11/1 occur with other temperaments as well -- like lagaca (more mistuned) or restles (more complex). And as an &quot;icing on the cake&quot;, I can assure you that when I discovered &quot;emka&quot; back in March 2008, I was using it as a 2.5.11.13-limit temperament -- only a few weeks ago did I actually consider mapping some other primes with it.</p><p>Also note that most of these are very well usable as 5-limit temperaments, as I&apos;ve said earlier, sometimes tempering out very small intervals -- a good example of that being &quot;dodifo&quot;. But do we really want to distinguish 5-limit dodifo and 7|11|13-limit dodifo by calling the former &quot;dodifo&quot; and the latter, let&apos;s say, &quot;dodifoan&quot;? I don&apos;t think that&apos;s necessary. 5-limit meantone and 13-limit meantone are both called the same and we&apos;ve got used to that as well.</p><p>&gt; There are 6 different badness searches for each limit.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m not familiar with this topic of badness search -- can you expand on that?</p><p>&gt; There will be some overlap, but let&apos;s say 400 per search<br/>&gt; gives 1000 distinct rank 2 temperaments overall.

There are too many<br/>&gt; outliers to check right now.</p><p>That&apos;s understandable, I&apos;m also aware I&apos;ll still find more in the future --  as I&apos;ve said not too long ago, there are many possible methods for finding 2D temperaments ane each of them can give different results. I think that might be a possible explanation for why the 5-limit &quot;fifive&quot; doesn&apos;t seem to have been examined before.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=101783 href="#101783">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/8/2011 12:17:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr Pa&rcaron;&iacute;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Wow, thanks for such a huge contribution; I didn&apos;t assume<br/>&gt; you would do all of it in one &quot;session&quot;.

That&apos;s how I usually deal with long lists.  But<br/>you weren&apos;t making it easy for me because your format<br/>wasn&apos;t quite consistent.  And I&apos;d still have had to deal<br/>with this:</p><p>&gt; &gt;  I&apos;ve had to increase the reverse-lookup search<br/>&gt; &gt; size from 300 to 400<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I had absolutely no idea you had to do that -- what do<br/>&gt; you mean by &quot;reverse lookup search&quot;?</p><p>Originally, I was only keeping a database matching the<br/>Hermite normal form of the mapping to the name.  That&apos;s<br/>fine when there aren&apos;t many names, so the chance of a name<br/>mapping a different temperament in a different prime limit<br/>is slim.  But now I record the prime limits as well.  So I<br/>wrote a script to search for temperaments that might be in<br/>the database, and see if they match.  Because I&apos;m still<br/>using the old code (and I haven&apos;t parsed one of the Wiki<br/>pages to get the prime limits) I still run that script for<br/>all the new names.  And if it fails to match up a<br/>temperament, I have to add the exceptions in by hand.</p><p>Until yesterday, those exceptions were: Leonhard, Bidia,<br/>and Sqrtphi in the 13-limit; Casablanca, Cuboctahedra,<br/>Tritonic, and Semigamera in the 11-limit; and Hemigamera in<br/>the 7-limit.  Now there are a lot more and the search is<br/>working harder before it gets to that point.</p><p>If I could re-write the scripts, I could make things<br/>simpler, but the names haven&apos;t been coming so fast that<br/>that&apos;s been an issue.  The reverse lookup script takes well<br/>over 10 minutes to run.</p><p>&gt; Well, what I was suggesting was not so much about an<br/>&gt; optimal limit but rather about the highest limit which<br/>&gt; I&apos;d consider for taking into account before labeling it<br/>&gt; as an &quot;extension&quot;. A good example for an explanation<br/>&gt; might be meantone or meanpop; for both of these, the<br/>&gt; 13-limit is still considered a proper part of the<br/>&gt; mapping, which actually means that meantone is still<br/>&gt; &quot;meantone&quot;, no matter if you&apos;re talking about the 5-limit<br/>&gt; mapping, 7-limit, 11-limit, or 13-limit.

So, if I go<br/>&gt; back to the new temperaments, I think vishnean could<br/>&gt; still be called &quot;vishnean&quot; up to the 13-limit but I&apos;m<br/>&gt; actually not sure what the optimal limit should be for<br/>&gt; this particular temperament.</p><p>13-limit meantone is the second best 13-limit rank 2<br/>temperament for a target of 7.6 cents (the TE error of<br/>meantone).  It&apos;s the best for a 7 cent target.  Vishnean<br/>comes in at number 582 when you target it&apos;s TE error.<br/>There&apos;s a big difference between them.  To the extent that<br/>Vishnean doesn&apos;t look like it should have a name in the<br/>13-limit -- or, at least, the 581 temperaments ahead of it<br/>should also have names because there are so many 13-limit<br/>temperament classes that might be musically useful.<br/>Vishnean, as it happens, doesn&apos;t get picked up in  the 7- to<br/>11-limits either.  Neither does it make the shortlist of<br/>13-limit Vishnu extensions with the lowest target error I<br/>thought was plausible when I wrote the website:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/uv.cgi?uvs=</a>[23%2C6%2C-14&gt;&amp;page=13&amp;limit=13</p><p>It looks like Vishnean isn&apos;t notable at all.  If there&apos;s a<br/>reason it is, scholars can puzzle it out when they analyze<br/>this database of named temperaments I&apos;m building up.</p><p>&gt; A nice example demonstrating the difference between the<br/>&gt; highest limit and a possible optimal limit is &quot;kastro&quot;<br/>&gt; which I think could still be labeled &quot;kastro&quot; as high as<br/>&gt; in the 13-limit, even though the 13 identity brings<br/>&gt; significantly more mistuning than all the lower ones do.<br/>&gt; So I think that an &quot;optimal&quot; limit could be either 7 or<br/>&gt; 11.

It<br/>isn&apos;t in the 7- or 13-limits.</p><p>If there&apos;s no other plausible 13-limit extension, the name<br/>doesn&apos;t have to go in.  It&apos;ll show up as Kastro+.</p><p>&gt; What&apos;s more, for some temperaments, a quest for the<br/>&gt; optimal limit would mean to take partial limits into<br/>&gt; account, which would probably turn the entire concept of<br/>&gt; temperament families on its head. For example, the one I<br/>&gt; call &quot;maja&quot; (53&amp;61) is perfectly usable either as a<br/>&gt; 5-limit temperament or as a 2.3.5.13-limit temperament.<br/>&gt; But once I add 7 or 11 to the mix, the comparable quality<br/>&gt; of the temperament is debatable.

It can go in, but it&apos;s another thing<br/>that doesn&apos;t look notable:</p><p><a href="http://31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=53%2661&limit=2.3.5.13">http://31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=53%2661&limit=2.3.5.13</a></p><p><a href="http://31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=53%2661&limit=5">http://31eq.com/cgi-bin/rt.cgi?ets=53%2661&limit=5</a></p><p>Lagaca gets found in the 5-limit, and in the 7-limit now<br/>that I&apos;ve increased the search size.  Emka is one of the<br/>few that got picked up in all applicable limits.  According<br/>to this search, it&apos;s an outstanding 2.5.11.13-limit<br/>temperament:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/pregular.cgi?limit=2.5.11.13&error=.3">http://x31eq.com/cgi-bin/pregular.cgi?limit=2.5.11.13&error=.3</a></p><p>So now it&apos;s listed as one.</p><p>&gt; Also note that most of these are very well usable as<br/>&gt; 5-limit temperaments, as I&apos;ve said earlier, sometimes<br/>&gt; tempering out very small intervals -- a good example of<br/>&gt; that being &quot;dodifo&quot;. But do we really want to distinguish<br/>&gt; 5-limit dodifo and 7|11|13-limit dodifo by calling the<br/>&gt; former &quot;dodifo&quot; and the latter, let&apos;s say, &quot;dodifoan&quot;? I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think that&apos;s necessary. 5-limit meantone and<br/>&gt; 13-limit meantone are both called the same and we&apos;ve got<br/>&gt; used to that as well.</p><p>Dodifo gets picked up in the 5-limit, but it isn&apos;t<br/>outstanding.  I&apos;m all for sharing names between limits.<br/>Then maybe we can keep it to less than 1000 total names<br/>instead of tens of thousands.  But the other issues whether<br/>lower scoring temperaments should have names at all.</p><p>&gt; &gt; There are 6 different badness searches for each limit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m not familiar with this topic of badness<br/>&gt; search -- can you expand on that?</p><p>Badness searches are what my website gives you.  The result<br/>is a list of temperaments sorted by badness, which is a<br/>balance of error and complexity.  There are ways of<br/>comparing Meantone and Ennealimmal with the same badness<br/>function, but I use one with a free parameter corresponding<br/>to the target error.  So if you search for 1 cent<br/>temperaments, the results should have a TE error of around<br/>1 cent (scaled up to the relative limit) and be more<br/>outstanding the further they deviate from it.</p><p>Currently I&apos;m searching from 0.01 cent/octave to 10<br/>cent/octave.

You made me &quot;re-ask myself&quot; why I picked that one in the first place. And I&apos;ll tell you why. Because my very first idea for extending both vishnu and fifive was to map the 13/1, which seemed to work okay. Later I thought: &quot;Hell, there must be a way there to map those 7s and 11s as well.&quot; And that&apos;s where vishnean and fifives came from. Although the 7/1 isn&apos;t particularly &quot;in tune&quot; in vishnean, I still think its fairly good in fifives.</p><p>&gt; Kastro does seem to get picked up in the 11-limit.  It<br/>&gt; isn&apos;t in the 7- or 13-limits.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>&gt; If there&apos;s no other plausible 13-limit extension, the name<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t have to go in.

I&apos;m all for sharing names between limits.<br/>&gt; Then maybe we can keep it to less than 1000 total names<br/>&gt; instead of tens of thousands.
