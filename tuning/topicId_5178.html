Heinz did in fact conceive his 13-tone scale in<br/>JI (and it&apos;s almost certainly a periodicity block in the tritave world), so<br/>this is right up his alley.

In other words, this agrees perfectly<br/>with the metric I advocate when the 5-limit is specified as the standard of<br/>consonance! So I think you have a good intuition for a complexity measure<br/>here but failed to explain it correctly. Can we try again?</p><p>&gt;&apos;1:3 tritave&apos; (is that your term Paul?)</p><p>Pierce called the 1:3 of the Bohlen-Pierce scale a &apos;tritave&apos;.</p><p>&gt;To extend this in the third dimension for 7-limit in the octave is slightly<br/>more complicated.</p><p>It seems, once you get the logarithmic relation right, your region of<br/>interest would effectively be a distorted cuboctahedron, with all vertices<br/>equidistant from the center. Again, this would agree perfectly with my<br/>7-limit metric.</p><p>&gt;One of the reasons that a number of well-known possibilities does not occur<br/>in this list is the following: there &gt;is no account of the fact that, when<br/>the two errors, before they are taken to be absolute values, have equal<br/>&gt;signs, they compensate each other partially for the representation of the<br/>major sixth 3:5. If we let this play &gt;along in the combined error<br/>calculation as follows, we get:</p><p>&gt;  f3 + log(3)/log(5)*f5 + log(3)/log(5)*f(5/3)</p><p>Considering the major sixth with equal weight as the major third seems<br/>totally consistent with the pictures you drew, while not considering it at<br/>all would be consistent with looking at rectangular regions in the lattice.<br/>Did you notice how close these results, and the 7-limit equivalents, are to<br/>the results of your periodicity block search -- while the results which<br/>don&apos;t consider the major sixth are much less close? Are your &quot;f&quot; errors<br/>measured in terms of the step size of the tuning? What if you used absolute<br/>error size? And how about, instead of adding the three errors, taking the<br/>sum-of-squares, or just taking the maximum?</p><p>This is very exciting stuff (to me) -- I hope Paul Hahn is also able to<br/>participate too.</p><p>By the way, Kees14.png does not show up on my browser.</p></div><h3>Kees van Prooijen &#x3C;kees@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/1999 8:09:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From: Paul H.

There were a couple of typos in the post, but it<br/>appears I was trying to do pretty much the same thing that you were trying<br/>to do in the 3-D lattice. I wrote, &quot;If we start with the simplest (defined<br/>by distance on the triangular lattice) unison vectors, and then replace the<br/>largest one with the next simplest, and repeat the process . . .&quot; I got the<br/>list of unison vectors from Fokker&apos;s paper, so the overall list doesn&apos;t<br/>conform to the boundary shape we agree should be used for any given level of<br/>complexity, but that only becomes an issue at the inner and outer edges. I<br/>totally screwed up, though, because the list I used was truncated to include<br/>UVs smaller than 35 cents and I started with the largest rather than<br/>simplest ones, or something like that. Towards the end, my results start to<br/>agree with yours: here is the end of the list of unison vectors (with ratios<br/>translated from matrix notation) and scale sizes that I posted:</p><p>| 1 -3 -2|<br/>| 3 -1 -3| = 0<br/>| 2  2 -1|</p><p>(6144:6125, 1728:1715, 225:224)</p><p>| 1 -3 -2|<br/>| 1  0  3| = 31<br/>| 2  2 -1|</p><p>(6144:6125, 1029:1024, 225:224)</p><p>| 1 -3 -2|<br/>|-1 -2  4| = 31<br/>| 2  2 -1|</p><p>(6144:6125, 2401:2400, 225:224)</p><p>| 1 -3 -2|<br/>|-1 -2  4| = 0<br/>| 0 -5  2|</p><p>(6144:6125, 2401:2400, 3136:3125)</p><p>| 1 -3 -2|<br/>|-1 -2  4| = 99<br/>|-7  4  1|</p><p>(6144:6125, 2401:2400, 4375:4374)</p><p>| 8  1  0|<br/>|-1 -2  4| = 171<br/>|-7  4  1|</p><p>(32805:32768, 2401:2400, 4375:4374)</p><p>Anyway, let me ask you this: Considering the 5-limit case for now, how do<br/>you know that there won&apos;t be an interval in the scale that is smaller than a<br/>unison vector? Even if the unison vectors both are the smallest within the<br/>half-hexagonal &quot;boundary&quot;, the parallogram defined by those vectors may<br/>extend beyond the boundary, and may happen to include one or more smaller<br/>unison vectors. (Flipping the sign of one of the unison vectors will lead to<br/>a parallelogram that extends over a different part of the boundary, and<br/>again one or more unison vectors may lie in that region.) Isn&apos;t that so?</p></div>
