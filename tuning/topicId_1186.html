I myself have done<br/>experiments in this realm, often with striking effects. What I objected to<br/>was the point of view (and I didn&apos;t mean to suggest that Sethares held this<br/>opinion) that tuning MUST be mapped to timbre.</p><p>I think it is a complex issue, and I look forward to reading Sethares&apos;<br/>book. My experience is that musically successful tuning depends on a lot of<br/>factors, which timbre can effect but ultimately aesthetics control. My<br/>gender, like Daniel&apos;s, has a very prominent fundamental and several odd<br/>harmonics. Because of the soft mallets and helmholtz resonators (which were<br/>invented in Java long before Helmholtz), the fundamental and harmonics last<br/>a long time, while most of the non-harmonic partials fade fairly quickly.<br/>The timbres of Harrison&apos;s American Gamelan (Old Grandad), Kraig Grady&apos;s<br/>Anaphorian metallophones, and those of Bill Sly and George Zellenz are<br/>similar. They work very well with JI.</p><p>Now, if I had a timbre that was on the borderline of pitch definability,<br/>like a bell with many prominent and long-lasting non-harmonic partials,<br/>would JI still be a viable choice? I would say that it&apos;s possible,<br/>depending on the musical context. I haven&apos;t tried this myself, but I have<br/>heard the triangular &quot;kenongs&quot; of Harrison/Colvig and George Zellenz used<br/>to great effect, likewise Colvig&apos;s oxygen tanks. Would another tuning,<br/>possibly one based on the non-harmonic partials work? Again, it depends on<br/>the music. I&apos;m sure that great musical effects could be found either way.<br/>In your own case, I think the ideal way to explore the possibilites would<br/>be to sample your bell instrument and try it in different tunings in a<br/>musical context.</p><p>In most music, the fundamental is not just any other partial -- it is the<br/>pitch we hear. I think it has a special place in the perception of tuning<br/>and consonance/dissonance.</p><p>Paul Erlich asked:</p><p>&gt;Bill, have you used 7-limit or higher utonalities? With harmonic<br/>&gt;timbres, inharmonic ones, or both? What do you think of them?</p><p>I have experimented with some utonalities but I have never consistently<br/>used them in a piece. For example, I thought about using an utonal tuning<br/>system in one half of a piece I just did, but decided against it after<br/>several experiments. For this particular section, I wanted a small semitone<br/>above 1/1, and it would take a very high order utonality to achieve that. I<br/>also decided that I wanted some intervallic parallelism and a 3:2 to<br/>establish the initial tonality. At the same time I didn&apos;t otherwise want a<br/>clear otonality. What I can up with was:</p><p>1/1  22/21  10/9  7/6  9/7  4/3  3/2  11/7  14/9  7/4  2/1</p><p>though some were used only briefly.</p><p>I did use noisy computer-generated timbres through a lot of the section<br/>(though I can&apos;t say that any had clear non-harmonic partials), but<br/>reinforced with sine waves at the important frequencies. I liked the<br/>effect, though it was very different than an otonality (which was the next<br/>section). The first section has a consonant, but definitely dark and<br/>mysterious flavor that is missing in the firm, bright, otonal section<br/>(where there are a few non-harmonic partials, but never prominent).</p><p>To get back to your specific suggestion, I will try it sometime.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

What they have done<br/>is taken a few essentially qualities, namely the envelope and a clear,<br/>long-ringing fundamental, and given them a spectra that was only broadly<br/>similar to the model.  It seems clear that a kenong needs inharmonic<br/>partials, which presumably help in projecting the instrument distinctively<br/>through the ensemble,  but the acceptable tunings of those partials seem to<br/>vary over a wide range.</p><p>In the middle of its two-octave range, my  bonang (a Javanese gong-chime)<br/>has gongs with a prominent overtone a bit wider than a fifth, much as<br/>Sethares describes in his book. The lower you go, however, this interval<br/>starts to widen to around a 7/4, and on the higher tones, this narrows to a<br/>wide fourth.  Again, the presence of this overtone is very important, but<br/>the exact tuning is not, other than the fact that the interval between the<br/>first two partials decreases in a smooth sequence over the range of the<br/>instrument.</p><p>It&apos;s constantly amazing to me how little we know about how sounds cohere<br/>and decohere and the powerful ways in which these qualities can be used to<br/>&apos;orchestrate&apos; a set of pitches.  I have been working recently on a series<br/>of studies in Eikosanies. The first, intended as an homage to Skryabin,<br/>uses the obstreperous set (1,5,7,9,11,13).  To get acclimated, I first used<br/>a set of twenty frequencies derived simply from multiplication by a<br/>fundmental of 2 Hz, thus the tone (1*5*7) was set at 70 Hz, etc.. Then I<br/>generated all 30 of the primary harmonic and subharmonic tetrads with sine<br/>waves. It is amazing to hear how they progress from completely melded<br/>composite sonorities to dissonant , albeit coherent chords with distinct<br/>pitches.  A sequence of these  chords now forms the background for a<br/>single-line faux-piano melody using tones from the complete stellate<br/>Eikosany.</p></div>
