They felt that they needed it because abandoning<br/>the traditional tonal functions left them, as Schoenberg so<br/>aptly put it late in life, &apos;adrift in a sea of boiling water,<br/>with no choice but to swim for safety&apos;.  Serialism was the<br/>nearest shore.</p><p>(Can&apos;t find the reference for that - I believe it&apos;s in one<br/>of Schoenberg&apos;s _Letters_).</p><p>I&apos;ve just posted on the fact that Webern was accepting of<br/>&apos;quarter-tone&apos; music, and have posted many times in the past<br/>on Scheonberg&apos;s microtonal observations.</p><p>The big problem discussing this &apos;end of tonality&apos; situation<br/>is that very people who effected the musical transformation<br/>held quite a different view of it from those who commented<br/>on it.</p><p>Schoenberg and his pupils were viewing their free use of<br/>the &apos;dissonances&apos; as the incorporation of higher-partial<br/>ratios into their harmonic language, in a kind of &apos;very<br/>extended tonality&apos;.  Hence, Schoenberg&apos;s preference for<br/>the term &apos;pantonality&apos;.</p><p>One example, from the 75-year-old Schoenberg:</p><p>[Schoenberg, &apos;My Evolution&apos;, 1949, in _Style and Idea_, p 86]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my _Harmonielehre_ (1911), I maintained that the future<br/>&gt; would certainly prove that a centralizing power comparable to<br/>&gt; the gravitation exerted by the root is still operative in these<br/>&gt; pieces [Schoenberg&apos;s &apos;atonal&apos; works of 1908].  In view of the<br/>&gt; fact that, for example, the laws of Bach&apos;s or Beethoven&apos;s<br/>&gt; structural procedures or of Wagner&apos;s harmony have not yet been<br/>&gt; established in a truly scientific manner, it is not surprising<br/>&gt; that no such attempt has been made with respect to &apos;atonality&apos;.</p><p>The commentators didn&apos;t see it this way, pinned the tag<br/>&apos;atonality&apos; on it, and the name (and its connotations)<br/>stuck.</p><p>(Of course, many of the papers and books cited in my previous<br/>post to Carl consititute the attempt to study serialism, and<br/>tonality for that matter, &apos;in a truly scientific manner&apos;.)</p><p>Joseph L.
