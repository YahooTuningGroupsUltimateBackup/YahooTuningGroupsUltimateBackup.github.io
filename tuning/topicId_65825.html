When tuning up a guitar, I always make<br/>sure to tune it piano, because plucking the<br/>strings forte gives a different transient<br/>pitch curve, and always listen to tell the<br/>sustained note is in tune.  So I tune up a bit<br/>slower than some others ... ;-)</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m trying to remember what bad electric fretless bass<br/>&gt; intonation sounds like.  ...<br/>BAD!</p><p>&gt; ...I think it&apos;s the same problem.

The thing is, I swear it&apos;s harder to<br/>pitch a stringed instrument correctly in<br/>music with a stronger attack.  Some players<br/>seem to get all their volume from the attack,<br/>rather than the sustain, which leads to some<br/>pretty noisy and sloppy playing.</p><p>&gt; Maybe it&apos;s just that it&apos;s hard to move one&apos;s hand far enough<br/>&gt; fast enough, especially with quick-moving walking bass lines<br/>&gt; typical of jazz.</p><p>I&apos;d warrant this mechanical limitation is<br/>behind a lot of poor intonation on strings,<br/>not just the bass ones, although the effect<br/>is multiplied there by the instrument&apos;s<br/>dimensions.
