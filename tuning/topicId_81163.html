Making<br/>&gt;&gt; the comma jump exist between the ii and V sort of works too, although<br/>&gt;&gt; it isn&apos;t quite as smooth... I&apos;ve been also experimenting with making<br/>&gt;&gt; the iim9 chord use pythagorean minor thirds instead of 6/5 ones, so<br/>&gt;&gt; that the next V9 chord can have the pythagorean minor third between<br/>&gt;&gt; the fifth and the seventh (using a 16/9 seventh), the sound of which I<br/>&gt;&gt; do tend to like a lot.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Is there some ingenious solution worked out?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah yes this is the single most annoying problem there is!<br/>&gt; Since normal music theory / harmony states so clearly you should be able to<br/>&gt; do this in major mode.<br/>&gt; But this is one of the things that&apos;s most wrong about normal music theory.<br/>&gt; This progression is usually not inside the major mode but involves a<br/>&gt; modulation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Below are the base JI major modes:<br/>&gt; C D E F G A B C<br/>&gt; 1/1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1       mode 1.1<br/>&gt; 1/1 10/9 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8 2/1      mode 2.3<br/>&gt; 1/1 9/8 5/4 27/20 3/2 27/16 15/8 2/1   mode 3.4<br/>&gt; 1/1 10/9 5/4 4/3 40/27 5/3 50/27 2/1   mode 4.7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can indeed do any 3 of the chords in one of the major modes.
