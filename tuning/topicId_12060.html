I think this is an important distinction that you might<br/>not be taking into consideration. I also occasionally use some unusual<br/>equal temperaments in the usual sense; i.e., to achieve a greater<br/>degree of a certain desirable JI paradigm while at the same time<br/>tempering out another not so desirable condition of that JI paradigm<br/>(see the recent 5L4s, 9-tone posts)... and here the impetus and the<br/>&quot;compromise&quot; all seem sound enough. But I must say that I really do<br/>just see all this as a question of individual choice and preference<br/>(rather than anything that could be looked at in any sort of<br/>structural absolutist terms), and I personally prefer as deep a<br/>reservoir of potential as I can possibly imagine to work from; others<br/>may not.</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=12065 href="#12065">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2000 11:18:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12060">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12060</a></p><p>Personally I can see NO need (aside from the dictates of ones own<br/>artistic likes and dislikes) to prune the field of choices here...

Thank you so much for your response to my questions.<br/>Well, actually, MANY people have mentioned the desirability of<br/>limiting choice in the arts.  I believe T.S. Elliot was a great<br/>advocate of restrictions... but I don&apos;t have any quotes handy here.</p><p>Surely Jean Cocteau was:</p><p>QUOTATION:<br/>&quot;Commissions suit me. They set limits. Jean Marais dared me to write<br/>play in which he would not speak in the first act, would weep for joy<br/>in the second and in the last would fall backward down a flight of<br/>stairs.&quot;</p><p>This reminds me of a discussion that I am constantly having with<br/>Johnny Reinhard.  I think we will always disagree on this matter,<br/>since it is more a matter of personality than anything.  He advocates<br/>TOTAL FREEDOM, and a &quot;polymicrotonal&quot; approach, and I abhor that...<br/>prefering some kind of limitation in my materials.</p><p>For example, if I were to write a grand piece for garbage pail,<br/>garden hose and hammer, I would stick with, and be wildly creative<br/>with my garbage pail, garden hose and hammer.  I wouldn&apos;t think for a<br/>MOMENT of throwing a SCREWDRIVER in there!  That would sound terrible.</p><p>I prefer restricted materials, and &quot;wild creativity&quot; within the<br/>confines of those parameters.  Even Stravinsky believed in this<br/>concept.  In fact, he found great solace in the fact that he only had<br/>12 white and black keys to work with.  (What tuning heresy!)  I can&apos;t<br/>find the quote right here... but I believe it is from his<br/>&quot;Autobiography.&quot;</p><p>&gt; I personally tend to use a lot of equal tunings simply for the<br/>beauty and musical usefulness (as I see it) inherent in them, and a<br/>lot of these are by no means even best seen as &quot;temperaments&quot;; i.e.,<br/>11, 13, 20, (etc.). I think this is an important distinction that you<br/>might not be taking into consideration.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, of course, these ET&apos;s look really terrible from the point of<br/>view of Paul Erlich&apos;s &quot;ET consonance chart&quot; so some might be inclined<br/>to not think of them as tunings at all.</p><p>I would never say such a thing.  But I imagine someone like Harry<br/>Partch might (!?)</p><p>I would tend to think such ETs would fall more in the realm of a<br/>&quot;fabrication&quot; not in the prevarication sense, but more akin to the<br/>12-tone system.  It&apos;s a wonder you are not so interested in that.</p><p>But, on the other hand, you admire Ives and his polychromatic<br/>constructs, so there is certainly some consistency in that viewpoint.</p><p>Thanks so very much again for your comments!!!<br/>___________ _____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=12072 href="#12072">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@apple.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/30/2000 1:07:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Personally I can see NO need (aside from the dictates of ones own<br/>&gt;&gt; artistic likes and dislikes) to prune the field of choices here...</p><p>There are two kinds of restrictions that artists accept in contemplating the making of an art work:</p><p>1.
