Mediant property has nothing<br/>to do with restriction modalities but only with fact of being Stern-Brocot<br/>subtrees. Besides, with calculation depending of distance between ratios,<br/>jump to subsequent series results in few abrupt change in places.</p><p>For the sake of coherence it could be useful for particular calculation to<br/>use series of N-first [strata/layers/levels??] of Stern-Brocot tree. What<br/>is expecting ?</p><p>  - well-distributed changes from a series to the next<br/>  - possibility to rely on coherent distribution (new variant).</p><p>Here are N-first complete layers series in Stern-Brocot tree for N=1 to N=5 :</p><p>1 1 2 1 3 2 3 1 4 3 5 2 5 3 4 1 5 4 7 3 8 5 7 2 7 5 8 3 7 4 5<br/>5 4 7 3 8 5 7 2 7 5 8 3 7 4 5 1 4 3 5 2 5 3 4 1 3 2 3 1 2 1 1</p><p>  1   1   2   1   3   2   3   1   4   3   5   2   5   3   4<br/>  4   3   5   2   5   3   4   1   3   2   3   1   2   1   1</p><p>      1       1       2       1       3       2       3<br/>      3       2       3       1       2       1       1</p><p>              1               1               2<br/>              2               1               1</p><p>                              1<br/>                              1</p><p>And here are N-first layers series limited to first octave for N=5 and N=6 :</p><p>1  6  5  9  4  11  7  10  3  11  8  13  5  12  7  9  2<br/>1  5  4  7  3   8  5   7  2   7  5   8  3   7  4  5  1</p><p>1     5     4      7      3      8      5     7      2<br/>1     4     3      5      2      5      3     4      1</p><p>Now, what I mean by coherent distribution ?</p><p>As you know probably, by citation of Alex Bogomolny, I have soon<br/>demonstrated that Arithmetic Sum of simplicities on each layer is equal to<br/>1. This is equivalent to Harmonic Sum of complexities defined as 2^sonance<br/>or ab, in the case of reduced a/b. I recall what is Harmonic Sum :</p><p>   HS (a, b, c ...) = 1/(1/a + 1/b + 1/c ...)</p><p>If we attribute to each reduced ratio a/b of N-first layers series a weight<br/>equal to Nab then Harmonic Sum of those weights is equal to 1. I don&apos;t need<br/>to demonstrate that since it&apos;s almost an evidence.</p><p>New fitted weights are defined at limits and vary only by factor N/N-1 when<br/>jumping to N.</p><p>I did&apos;nt read sufficiently on entropy theory to know if relevant as<br/>starting series. It seems only, at first glance, that it would be<br/>independant of subsequent physiological (and other) hypothesis by which<br/>smoothing and upper limitation of distribution could be obtained.</p><p>Here are weights for N=1 to N=4 of complete series :</p><p>   16  12  40   8  60  24  48   4  48  24  60   8  40  12  16<br/>        9       6      18       3      18       6       9<br/>                4               2               4<br/>                                1</p><p>And here are weights for N=1 to N=6 for series limited to first octave :</p><p>6  80 120 378  72 528 210 420  36 462 240 624  80 504 168 270  12<br/>5     100      60     175      30     200      75     140      10<br/>4              48              24              60               8<br/>3                              18                               6<br/>2                                                               4<br/>1</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t encroach on Paul&apos;s theory concerning smoothing and upper<br/>limitation of dissonance curve, but I would like to express general<br/>comments about all possible theories where perception could be implied.</p><p>I would say that perception don&apos;t create phenomenon but only sensation that<br/>tends to reveal part of reality. Art may freely focus on impression and<br/>texture but science may not. How generally (in mind) presence at musical<br/>work is built implies understanding of how intelligibility is preserved in<br/>complex sound perception. By analogy, I ask : &quot;Has mind only PhotoShop<br/>working on bitmaps or also FreeHand working on vectorialy built images ?&quot;</p><p>My remark don&apos;t concern perceptive theories as such but possible<br/>unrestricted interpretation out of validity domain. Besides, in the same<br/>spirit, I recall that &quot;lot of mathematics&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;most<br/>scientific&quot;.</p><p>I don&apos;t remind who has written something like that : &quot;Computers aren&apos;t very<br/>useful, they give only anwsers&quot;.</p><p>Pierre Lamothe</p></div>
