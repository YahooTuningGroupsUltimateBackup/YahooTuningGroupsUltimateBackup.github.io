However, as many others I am also<br/>&gt; overwhelmed by the sheer mass of supported symbols ;-)</p><p>Hi Torsten. Welcome to the list.</p><p>Carl&apos;s remark about Xenharmonikon refers to the fact that while the<br/>Sagittal article claims to have been reprinted from Xenharmonikon 18<br/>(2004), in fact this issue of the journal does not exist, and now can<br/>never exist. Although the editor, John Chalmers, assures us that #18<br/>will be published any year now. And as we all know, the sooner you<br/>fall behind, the more time you&apos;ll have to catch up. (Sorry John, I<br/>couldn&apos;t resist. :-)</p><p>Yes. I think perhaps we made a mistake in publishing that superset in<br/>Table 3 of<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/Sagittal.pdf</a><br/>You could be forgiven for running screaming. And in fact George and I<br/>have just recently agreed that we don&apos;t need them! We only need the<br/>union of the &quot;Athenian&quot; and &quot;Trojan&quot; sets (most of which are common to<br/>both) and a very few others. The addition of accent marks to these<br/>symbols will take care of everything else. Two recent innovations, not<br/>described on the website yet, have led to this simplification - right<br/>accents and &quot;smart defaults&quot;.</p><p>I suppose that even the Athenian JI notation can look fairly daunting<br/>at first. But once you get used to the way the symbols are composed of<br/>a small number of graphical elements combined in logical ways, I don&apos;t<br/>think it&apos;s too bad. The accurate notation of extended-JI is of course<br/>the most demanding task for any notation system.</p><p>But that&apos;s one reason why we recommend that readers start with the<br/>mythology.<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/gift/GiftOfTheGods.htm">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/gift/GiftOfTheGods.htm</a><br/>It&apos;s a far gentler introduction, although as yet incomplete.</p><p>&gt; I am looking for a notation which shows the intended analytic &apos;meaning&apos;<br/>&gt; in a as much as possible comprehensible way. I would like to use the<br/>&gt; conventional accidentals (#, b) to denote the untempered circle of fifth</p><p>That is certainly standard Sagittal for JI, although I&apos;d call it a<br/>chain or spiral of fifths rather than a circle.</p><p>&gt; and use Sagittal symbols only to represent single commas which can be<br/>&gt; accumulated in a row. I contact you to check whether you would consider<br/>&gt; my intended use of Sagittal approvable or whether it violates some<br/>&gt; standard ;-)</p><p>Please feel free to use them that way, if that&apos;s what works for you.<br/>But it is not the way preferred by the authors. We prefer to use one<br/>of two systems (a) &quot;pure sagittal&quot; a single sagittal accidental per<br/>note or (b) &quot;mixed sagittal&quot; a maximum of two accidentals where one is<br/>a conventional sharp or flat or double thereof and the other is a<br/>single-shaft sagittal.</p><p>However, an important stage in the evolution of sagittal (like several<br/>earlier systems) was the idea of having one symbol per prime number.<br/>Those symbols still exist in Sagittal. Their prime comma meanings are<br/>shown in bold in Table 1, although some are now only secondary<br/>meanings for their symbols (13, 29 and greater), and for convenience a<br/>few primes have more than one comma symbol (5, 17, 19).</p><p>If you wish to use more than three accidentals per note then we<br/>recommend using only these single-shaft prime-comma symbols, with<br/>conventional sharps and flats representing the prime number 3. And we<br/>suggest they should always be listed in order of prime number as you<br/>go away from the letter nominal or notehead (left to right in text and<br/>right to left on the staff).</p><p>But we hope that once you get to know sagittal better you won&apos;t see<br/>the need for this, or perhaps only rarely.</p><p>&gt; For example (C=1/1), I want to notate the chord 5/6, 25/24, 5/4, 35/24<br/>&gt; (i.e. the dominant seventh over 5/6). I would notate (the comma &apos;,&apos;<br/>&gt; separates accidentals):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A\! C#,\!,\! E\! G\!,!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here, the disadvantage is certainly that I easily end up with more then<br/>&gt; 3 accidentals in a row. The advantage I see, however, is that I can<br/>&gt; easily read, e.g., a dominant seventh lowered by a syntonic comma.<br/>&gt; Alternatively, e.g. for a 72-EDO I could write<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A\! C||) E\! G\|/<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With this notation (apart from being less accurate) it is harder to<br/>&gt; recognise the familiar dominant seventh accord. Thus, I would prefer<br/>&gt; the former notation.</p><p>This certainly _is_ less accurate! I&apos;m not sure why you think we would<br/>suggest it at all. See Figures 5 and 7.</p><p>In mixed sagittal we would write</p><p>A\! C#\\! E\! G\!)</p><p>and in pure sagittal</p><p>A\! C)||( E\! G\!)</p><p>although personally I&apos;d call this a subminor seventh chord or harmonic<br/>seventh chord since I think of a dominant seventh chord as a 5-limit<br/>thing.</p><p>I&apos;m sure you will agree that the seventh chord is easy enough to read<br/>in the mixed notation above. (I&apos;ll assume you are not interested in<br/>the pure sagittal from here on.)</p><p>I agree there are other examples of chords shifted by multiple commas,<br/>or by commas in the opposite direction, where even the standard mixed<br/>sagittal might obscure the chord structure.</p><p>We were talking with Robert Walker (of Fractal Tune Smithy fame)<br/>recently about this very thing and we agreed that it made sense in<br/>this case to indicate the common comma offset with one sagittal nearer<br/>to the nominal or notehead and the indidual commas further away. Any<br/>conventional sharps or flats would still be closest to the nominal or<br/>notehead. But the aim here was to limit it to no more than 3<br/>accidentals per note, so multiple comma shifts must still be contracted.</p><p>The result of this would be exactly as you first wrote it above<br/>(although the separator after &quot;#&quot; isn&apos;t necessary).</p><p>A\! C#\!,\! E\! G\!,!)</p><p>Your choice of the comma &apos;,&apos; as a separator is a good one as this<br/>character is not used in any ASCII representation of any sagittal.</p><p>&gt; Now, Sagittal certainly allows to contract G\!,!) to G\!). However,<br/>&gt; so far I did not found out how I could notate C#,\!,\!</p><p>Just as \!,!) = \!)</p><p>we have \!,\! = \\!</p><p>See degree 8 of Figure 5, or the fifth symbol from the bottom in Table 1.</p><p>We also have the not so obvious contraction where a 5-comma up<br/>combined with a 7-comma down results in a 5:7-kleisma down.</p><p>/|,!) = !(</p><p> It&apos;s not so obvious graphically because it involves a subtraction and<br/>the result is smaller than either of the two operands. But you can<br/>sort of imagine that the straight barb makes the convex arc flip about<br/>a 45 degree line and become a concave scroll.</p><p>&gt; (or even C#,\!,\!,\!) in a more concise way such that the<br/>accumulation of syntonic<br/>&gt; commas is obvious.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid that once you go beyond an accumulation of two commas, the<br/>symbols are not so graphically obvious, and yet they are still logical<br/>in a different way.</p><p>What we find when we accumulate three 5-commas (to obtain a<br/>125-large-diesis) is that we are only 0.4 cents away from the 35-large<br/>diesis whose down symbol is (!/  [See the bottom of Table 1]. So it<br/>doesn&apos;t make sense to have a completely different symbol for the<br/>125-L-diesis (triple 5-comma). If you really need to distinguish these<br/>two large dieses (e.g. when abstracted from any actual notes) you can<br/>add a right accent mark in the opposite direction to the symbol to<br/>subtract that 0.4 cents. So a triple 5-comma down is written in ASCII<br/>as (!/&apos;</p><p>The upward accent is shown in ASCII as an apostrophe or single-quote &apos;<br/>and the downward is shown as a period or full-stop . so we have to be<br/>careful when ASCII sagittals appear at the end of a sentence. The<br/>usual thing is to leave a space or two after the sagittal in that<br/>case, or to omit the full-stop altogether and start a new line.</p><p>Another lexical problem in discussing these symbols in ASCII is that<br/>parenthetic remarks [like this] are sometimes better put in square<br/>brackets to avoid confusion with the round brackets used in ASCII<br/>sagittals.</p><p>Sagittal accents can often be omitted (or ignored) in actual music,<br/>due to the system of &quot;smart defaults&quot; mentioned earlier. This is based<br/>on the most common usage and uses the nominal that the accidental is<br/>applied to (and any sharps or flats), to determine which comma is<br/>intended. It takes into account the choice of 1/1.</p><p>A zipped Excel spreadsheet giving this information is at<br/><a href="http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/AthenianSmartDefaults.zip">http://dkeenan.com/sagittal/AthenianSmartDefaults.zip</a></p><p>But note that this table is really only needed for machine<br/>interpretation of the Athenian JI notation. Humans can do the same<br/>thing by ear, and in any case the worst possible error is only about 2<br/>cents.</p><p>You don&apos;t need to use this table to convert ratios to Athenian<br/>sagittal either. That is a much simpler process that involves simply<br/>converting the comma to cents and looking it up on the number line at<br/>the bottom of Figure 5. The exact boundaries are given in Scala&apos;s<br/>sag_ji1.par. And of course Scala can do the job for you automatically<br/>if you SET NOTATION SAJI1 and SET SAGITTAL MIXED. Scala can be found<br/>at <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/</a></p><p>Unfortunately we are still working on the higher precision JI<br/>notations that will automatically include the correct accent marks.</p><p>Now to your specific example of C#\!,\!,\!)</p><p>If this is part of an entire chord that has been shifted by two<br/>5-commas we could write it C#\\!,\!)  . If the whole chord is shifted<br/>by three 5-commas we could write it C#(!/&apos;,!)  and the accent might be<br/>able to be unambiguously omitted to give C#(!/,!)  .</p><p>In standard mixed sagittal we would calculate the sum of the commas in<br/>cents = 3*-21.51 + -27.26 = -91.79 cents. This has an absolute value<br/>too big for a single-shaft sagittal so we would add in (and thereby<br/>partly cancel) the apotome represented by the sharp.<br/>113.69 - 91.79 = 21.9 cents.</p><p>This is of course only 0.4 cents larger than a 5-comma up and it would<br/>be written as C/|&apos; or simply C/|  .</p><p>A performer is certainly going to have a much easier time figuring out<br/>how to play or sing a C/| or a C/|&apos; than trying to figure out what<br/>they are supposed to do with C#\!,\!,\!)  . But of course the composer<br/>may understand it better when written in the long form.</p><p>&gt; PS: I am new to this list.

With a grain<br/>&gt; of salt: it appears to me, notating A- C#-- as A- C#&lt;<br/>&gt; (where &lt; means either two syntonic commas or a septimal comma)<br/>&gt; is a bit like (in classical notation) substituting A C#<br/>&gt; by A Db (where C# and Db are the same key on the piano).<br/>&gt; I should add that I am talking here mainly about a notation<br/>&gt; which allows me to better understand the analytical harmonic<br/>&gt; &apos;meaning&apos; of the music -- I may rewrite the whole thing for<br/>&gt; performers..</p><p>yes, well now i see clearly that the JI-HEWM concept is<br/>the one you want.  in fact, i believe that sagittal was<br/>based on essentially the same concepts.  as i said before,<br/>the big difference between sagittal and my version of HEWM<br/>is that HEWM is far more limited, only defined up to 11-limit JI.<br/>the proposal by Daniel Wolf (quoted on my HEWM webpage) goes<br/>up to 23-limit.  but if 11-limit is good enough, then my HEWM<br/>a provides a nice compact symbol set.</p><p>years before i came up with the HEWM symbols, i was struggling<br/>with the same problem, and came up with the idea of using<br/>the vector of the prime-factor exponents (which Gene Ward Smith<br/>named a &quot;monzo&quot; after you know who) *as* an accidental. so,<br/>to use you example chord again, if C = 1/1 = [0 0, 0 0&gt; , then</p><p>5/6 25/24 5/4 35/24 =<br/>A [-1 -1, 1 0&gt;, C# [-3 -1, 2 0&gt;, E [-2 0, 1 0&gt;, G [-3 -1, 1 1&gt;</p><p>much more long-winded, i know.  but staff-notation shows<br/>the pitch-height of the note, and so the exponent of 2 can<br/>be omitted.  so we get:</p><p>A [-1, 1 0&gt;, C# [-1, 2 0&gt;, E [0, 1 0&gt;, G [-1, 1 1&gt;</p><p>the brackets and commas were not part of my original proposal,<br/>and have only been made part of the standard monzo notation<br/>recently.  in my original version, it would look like this:</p><p>A -1 1 0, C# -1 2 0, E 0 1 0, G -1 1 1</p><p>i realize that this is rather difficult for performers to<br/>read on-the-fly, but it has the advantage of using a very<br/>small symbol set -- only the digits 0...9 and the negative sign.<br/>(and the sharps and flats, which in my proposal are really<br/>part of the nominal and not part of the accidental).</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=57034 href="#57034">ðŸ”—</a>George D.

It&apos;s not all that complicated if you learn them a<br/>few at a time.</p><p>&gt; I am looking for a notation which shows the intended<br/>analytic &apos;meaning&apos;<br/>&gt; in a as much as possible comprehensible way. I would like to use the<br/>&gt; conventional accidentals (#, b) to denote the untempered circle of<br/>fifth<br/>&gt; and use Sagittal symbols only to represent single commas which can<br/>be<br/>&gt; accumulated in a row. I contact you to check whether you would<br/>consider<br/>&gt; my intended use of Sagittal approvable or whether it violates some<br/>&gt; standard ;-)</p><p>There are two principles that we have followed in devising the<br/>Sagittal symbols that are relevant here:</p><p>1) There should not be more than one Sagittal accidental modifying a<br/>single notehead.</p><p>2) No Sagittal symbol should contain more than two flags.</p><p>This would prohibit stacking more than two 5-comma flags at a time.<br/>putting you in much the same situation as with Roman numerals, where<br/>the restriction is to have no more than three like characters in a<br/>row, making &quot;III&quot; okay, but &quot;IIII&quot; becomes &quot;IV&quot;.</p><p>The analogy can be taken a step farther with the observation that,<br/>just as Roman numerals proved too cumbersome for many calculations,<br/>so would stacked symbol-elements (or flags) be too complicated for<br/>reading pitches and intervals.  Just as learning the meaning of<br/>Arabic numerals enables calculations to be done more efficiently, so<br/>does learning the athenian-level sequence of Sagittal symbols make<br/>the calculation of compound commas a relatively simple matter.</p><p>&gt; For example (C=1/1), I want to notate the chord 5/6, 25/24, 5/4,<br/>35/24<br/>&gt; (i.e. the dominant seventh over 5/6). I would notate (the comma &apos;,&apos;<br/>&gt; separates accidentals):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A\! C#,\!,\! E\! G\!,!)</p><p>In athenian-level JI this would be notated:</p><p>A\! C#\\! E\! G\!)</p><p>I think the meaning of the symbols is about as transparent as it<br/>could possibly be.</p><p>In pure Sagittal this would be:  A\! C)||( E\! G\!)<br/>Here the notation for the third of the chord is not so obvious, but<br/>I&apos;ll explain more about this below.</p><p>If you&apos;re running Windows and want your computer to display the<br/>Sagittal notation for just ratios, I recommend downloading Scala<br/>(freeware written by Manuel Op de Coul):</p><p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/</a></p><p>Once you have it up and running, enter the commands:</p><p>set notation saji1<br/>set sagittal mixed</p><p>Then go to the &quot;Tools&quot; menu and click on &quot;Ratio vector calculator&quot;<br/>(or use the shortcut key &lt;shift&gt;+&lt;alt&gt;+V).  You can then enter a<br/>ratio (relative to C) in the &quot;Pitch and Names&quot; box, e.g., 25/24 (as<br/>5/4 of A\!) and see one or two possible spellings (the SAJI1 names)<br/>in both ASCII text and with the actual symbols displayed next to a<br/>notehead.  (It&apos;s not necessary to select a tuning or load an .scl<br/>file to do this.)  As an alternative, you can enter the prime factors<br/>in the boxes above and let Scala calculate the ratio for you.</p><p>&gt; Here, the disadvantage is certainly that I easily end up with more<br/>then<br/>&gt; 3 accidentals in a row.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The advantage I see, however, is that I can<br/>&gt; easily read, e.g., a dominant seventh lowered by a syntonic comma.<br/>&gt; Alternatively, e.g. for a 72-EDO I could write<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A\! C||) E\! G\|/<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With this notation (apart from being less accurate) it is harder to<br/>&gt; recognise the familiar dominant seventh accord. Thus, I would<br/>prefer the<br/>&gt; former notation.</p><p>Yes, with the 72-mapping you need far fewer symbols, but you no<br/>longer are able to make as many distinctions of pitch.  With athenian-<br/>level (medium-precision) JI you have the ability to notate all of the<br/>11-limit consonances *exactly* and all of the 15-limit consonances to<br/>within less than a cent.  This is much better accuracy than would be<br/>expected by the ~5.4-cent resolution that results by dividing the<br/>apotome into 21 steps, which we have found to provide a good balance<br/>between simplicity and precision.</p><p>&gt; Now, Sagittal certainly allows to contract G\!,!) to G\!). However,<br/>so<br/>&gt; far I did not found out how I could notate C#,\!,\!</p><p>As I indicated above, this is simplified as C#\\!, for which the<br/>meaning should be obvious.</p><p>&gt; or even C#,<br/>&gt; \!,\!,\! in a more concise way such that the accumulation of<br/>syntonic<br/>&gt; commas is obvious.</p><p>[Note:  I removed the parentheses from the last part of your<br/>statement in order to clarify that you&apos;re discussing &quot;\!,\!,\!&quot;,<br/>not &quot;\!,\!,\!)&quot;.]</p><p>Immediately obvious?  No, but I think we can come quite close to that<br/>with something that&apos;s fairly easy to remember and very definitely<br/>clear and concise -- something akin to counting by fours with Arabic<br/>numerals.</p><p>If you look at Figure 5 on page 10 of our XH article you will see the<br/>sequence of athenian Sagittal symbols, which is not difficult to<br/>learn.  You will observe that accumulated 5-commas are notated by<br/>every 4th step in the sequence.  I already pointed out that the<br/>meaning of the symbol for two 5-commas down \\! is clear.  Follow the<br/>sequence down into the second row (and leftward) to the symbol (|\<br/>occupying the 12th step, for which the exact definition (8192:8505)<br/>differs from three 5-commas by only ~0.4 cents.  Its downward<br/>counterpart (!/ is the same as if one had written \\\!, so &quot;A&quot; 3<br/>commas down would therefore be notated A(!/ .  However, C# lowered by<br/>3 commas is not written C#(!/, but rather in the simpler form C/|),<br/>since we discourage employment of a sharp or flat in combination with<br/>a Sagittal accidental larger than 40% of an apotome (~46 cents)<br/>altering in the opposite direction.</p><p>How did I make the conversion from C#(!/ to C/|)?  Since /|) and (|\<br/>are apotome-complements, we can write the equation:<br/> # = /|) + (|\<br/>which can then be rewritten:<br/> # - (|\ = /|)<br/> # + (!/ = /|)<br/>Thus C#(!/ = C/|)</p><p>But, wait!  We&apos;re just getting started.  This, in turn, makes it easy<br/>to deduce the notation for C# four commas down: simply remove the<br/>left (5-comma-up) flag from C/|) to get C|); yes, this looks like a C<br/>raised by a 7-comma.  If you want to get technical, it&apos;s only ~0.4<br/>cents higher than that, so for all practical purposes we can consider<br/>the two to be the same pitch.</p><p>Now let&apos;s go one more!  To get C# five commas down all we need to do<br/>is replace the 7-comma-up symbol with a 5:7-kleisma-up symbol (i.e.,<br/>5103:5120, which is the *difference* between a 7-comma and a 5-comma)<br/>giving us C|( -- a C raised by ~6 cents.  Another way of arriving at<br/>the notation for these last two pitches is to look at the sequence<br/>C/|) C|) C|( and see that the accidentals are 4 steps apart in the<br/>athenian-level JI diagram.</p><p>If I were reading music that called for C# to be lowered by 5 commas,<br/>I think I would have a much better idea of the proper pitch if I saw<br/>C|( than if I had to read something like C#\\\\\!</p><p>So you see that this is indeed as easy as performing arithmetic using<br/>Arabic numerals -- once you have taken the time to memorize the<br/>athenian symbol sequence (which I think you will agree is more<br/>logical than the sequence of Arabic numerals, which, except for &quot;1&quot;,<br/>provides no clue as to meaning.).</p><p>I said above that I would show how the pure Sagittal could be made a<br/>little more obvious.  Referring to Figure 5 again, observe (just<br/>below the natural sign) that C# is written C/||\ in pure Sagittal.<br/>From there move 4 steps to the right to a symbol that is the apotome<br/>symbol without the right (5-comma) flag, giving C||\ as the<br/>equivalent of C#\! .  Four more steps to the right brings us to C)||(<br/>as the equivalent of C#\\! .  Four more steps (going upward around<br/>the end and up into the first row) brings us to C/|), which is C#<br/>lowered by three 5-commas, at which point we continue in the same<br/>manner as above.  So interval calculation becomes fairly simple once<br/>the sequence of athenian-level symbols is learned, just as numerical<br/>calculation is simplified by learning the sequence of Arabic numerals.</p><p>I hope this has addressed your questions satisfactorily.</p><p>Best,</p><p>--George Secor</p></div><h3><a id=57076 href="#57076">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;t.anders@qub.ac.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>2/23/2005 11:58:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Dave,</p><p>Thank you very much for your most detailed response.</p><p>On Tue, 2005-02-22 at 03:24, Dave Keenan wrote:<br/>&gt; However, an important stage in the evolution of sagittal (like several<br/>&gt; earlier systems) was the idea of having one symbol per prime number.<br/>&gt; Those symbols still exist in Sagittal.
