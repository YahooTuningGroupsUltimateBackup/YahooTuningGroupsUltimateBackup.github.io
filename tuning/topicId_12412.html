When you say &quot;results in diatonicity&quot;, am I understanding<br/>&gt;correctly that it is the interaction between the Rothenberg property<br/>&gt;and &quot;partial positions&quot; (perception of overtones in the timbre being<br/>&gt;used), is what results in the listener&apos;s perception of a scale&apos;s<br/>&gt;&quot;diatonicity&quot;?</p><p>Correct, except for the definition of &quot;partial positions&quot;, and that&apos;s<br/>my fault, for writing gibberish.  I meant one level higher than timbre<br/>here, a sort of meta-timbre.  The perception of the position of the<br/>fundamental of a melody note in the harmonic series of the fundamentals<br/>of the other notes.  Kapeesh?  Idea is, you can simply play a harmonic<br/>series over a drone and get a good, though primitive, sort of tune.</p><p>&gt;Very interesting!  Do explain more.</p><p>It isn&apos;t all that impressive, since I basically _define_ diatonicity<br/>with it.  Nevertheless, very few scales satisfy the definition, and I<br/>like the ones that do.  Here are all the ones I&apos;m aware of:</p><p>o Standard meantone pentatonic<br/>o Standard meantone diatonic<br/>o Standard meantone harmonic minor<br/>o Rimski-Korsakov octatonic, 12-tET (0 1 3 4 6 7 9 10)<br/>o Blackwood decatonic, 15-tET (0 1 3 4 6 7 9 10 12 13)<br/>o Erlich pentachordal decatonic, 22-tET (0 2 4 7 9 11 13 16 18 20)<br/>o Erlich symmetrical decatonic, 22-tET (0 2 4 7 9 11 13 15 18 20)<br/>o Keenan decatonic MOS, 29-tET (0 3 6 9 11 14 17 20 23 26)<br/>o Lumma decatonic, 31-tET (0 4 6 10 12 16 18 22 25 28)<br/>o Erlich double-diatonic, 26-tET (0 2 4 6 8 10 12 13 15 17 19 21 23 25)</p><p>The basic theme is that any time your brain/ear can follow something,<br/>there&apos;s potential to exploit it for melody.

I can get diatonicity from 02 and 03, or from 01 and 03.

So now, rather than just following a note in<br/>a harmonic series, we can take a set of pitches, and assign each of<br/>them a position in our imaginary harmonic series.  This gives us common<br/>tone modulation -- holding a pitch constant while changing its position<br/>in a harmonic series.  For example, with V-I in C-major, we have G<br/>going from 1 to 3.  You can even do more than one pitch at a time if<br/>you go from major to minor, or if you use certain forms of temperament.</p><p>So, aside from the natural repetitiveness in the harmonic series (i.e.<br/>6:9 = 3:2, etc.), we&apos;ll need to adjust our harmonic series segments to<br/>allow pitches to change their harmonic functions.

Miller allows a &quot;thing&quot; to be<br/>a group of related things.  He calls grouping to squeeze more out of<br/>memory &quot;chunking&quot;.  Interestingly, both octave-equivalence (symmetry<br/>at the 2:1) and tetrachordality (symmetry at the 3:2) can be seen as<br/>chunking the pitch set to reduce the burden on the listener&apos;s short<br/>term memory.</p><p>Sorry this post is so kludgy, but I&apos;m pressed for time.

To clarify the quoted paragraph:<br/>Since we can transpose a melody in scale intervals, we also want<br/>to be able to transpose it in harmonic intervals.  IOW, we want the<br/>ability to express the same set of harmonic intervals in each mode<br/>of the scale.  We don&apos;t want the listener hearing the modally-transposed<br/>tune with new scalar intervals, but still hearing the same harmonics<br/>as before the transposition.</p><p>&gt;So a good measure of Diatonicity is when the listener can use<br/>&gt;&quot;chunking&quot; - or perceiving a pitch set (scale/chord) as an overall<br/>&gt;Gestalt, and be able to easily recognize the set&apos;s members through<br/>&gt;their harmonic relationships (?).</p><p>Yes, if we believe that these two lead to the phenomenon of common-tone<br/>modulation.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=12483 href="#12483">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/7/2000 6:14:47 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;o Lumma decatonic, 31-tET (0 4 6 10 12 16 18 22 25 28)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Is this new?
