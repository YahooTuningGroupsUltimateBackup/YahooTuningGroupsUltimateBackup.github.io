First find the closest approximation to the primes in 34-ET (34, 54, 79, 95, 118). It makes it easier if you reduce to an octave (0, 20, 11, 27, 16). Then keep adding the 5/34 generator until you hit each of these (you reach 20 after 4 iterations of the generator, 45 after 9, which reduces to 11, and so on). Keep in mind that you can also go negative, so that in this case, 19 generators up is equivalent to 15 generators down. So one possible generator mapping for 5/34 is &lt;0, 4, 9, -15, 10], which you also get if you look at 7/48.</p><p>It&apos;s easy enough to put the octaves back in for the full rank 2 generator mapping, [&lt;1, 1, 1, 5, 2], &lt;0, 4, 9, -15, 10]&gt;. You can get all the information you need from this, but I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a convenient script on Graham&apos;s page for that. You can find the TOP-RMS generators with a spreadsheet and some matrix math, if I can find the paper that describes how to do it.</p></div><h3><a id=91463 href="#91463">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/1/2010 3:40:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 1 August 2010 23:20, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; You can take something like 5/34 and find a generator mapping for it.<br/>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>Yes, I have code to do that.
