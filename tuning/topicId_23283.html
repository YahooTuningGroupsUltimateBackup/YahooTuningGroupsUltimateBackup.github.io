For example, the note A is 440 Hz (cycles per<br/>second), and the note A&apos; an octave higher is 880 Hz. The ratio is 880:440 or 2:1. All octaves<br/>have ratio 2:1.</p><p>If you know an interval is x equal-tempered semitones, the formula for getting the ratio of the<br/>interval is</p><p>ratio = 2^(x/12).</p><p>Conversely, if you know an interval has ratio r, and you want to know how many<br/>equal-tempered semitones it is, the formula is</p><p>ET semitones = log(r)/log(2)*12</p><p>Hope this helps . . .</p></div><h3><a id=23370 href="#23370">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2001 5:19:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert Greco wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;could some one explain hoe to work out theese ratio&apos;s<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;im struggling away and not quite sure how to work them out ie<br/>octave 2:1</p><p>Hi Robert,</p><p>Our apologies for the disturbing meta-posts on the list.
