It<br/>&gt;&gt;becomes specially interesting when you listen to a set of pieces in<br/>&gt;&gt;many different keys, like Bach&apos;s two-part Inventions, the three-part<br/>&gt;&gt;Sinfonias or the Well-tempered clavier. Each key has it&apos;s own tuning<br/>&gt;&gt;characteristics. You can hear for example, without being absolute, if a<br/>&gt;&gt;piece is in D major or in Eb major.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Intuitively I think you will find about as much &apos;pain&apos; as in<br/>&gt;&gt;meantone-tuning.</p><p>John deLaubenfels:</p><p>&gt; I hear what you&apos;re saying, and it would be interesting to experience<br/>&gt; some of the works you cite in Werckmeister III tuning.  My guess<br/>&gt; (without yet having heard it) is that I&apos;d long for &quot;better&quot; tuning in<br/>&gt; the keys for which this fixed tuning is not so well suited, but in this<br/>&gt; respect my ears may be different from others&apos;.</p><p>John, please go ahead. The question remains to which extent a composer<br/>integrates the advantages or disadvantages of a specific tuning for a<br/>specific key in his works. He or she  might obtain a very good result in a<br/>key &quot;for which this fixed tuning is not so well suited&quot;, just by avoiding<br/>certain intervals.</p><p>I mentioned Bach&apos;s Inventions and Sinfonias, because of a LP recording by<br/>Gustav leonhardt. I recognize clearly the difference in tuning quality from<br/>one key to another and I&apos;m almost sure it&apos;s Werckmeister III, but I don&apos;t<br/>know enough about other temperaments, which may be quite simular, to make a<br/>definte statement about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do you happen to know of any MIDI sequences tuned in this fashion?  I&apos;m<br/>&gt; sure listening to them would improve my education!</p><p>I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t. The conservatory I&apos;m teaching at, uses a Yamaha midi<br/>&apos;pianola&apos; system. This system allows to reproduce mechanically ( by key<br/>pressure!) very complicated piano scores ( Debussy, Chopin...), on the same<br/>piano (Steinway), and immediately after they&apos;ve been played by whatsoever<br/>pianist. Almost impossible to tell the difference between the machine and<br/>the real pianist. All parameters (duration, dynamique, pitch..) are<br/>integrated and reproduced by means of a digital procedure. Could this system<br/>produce the perfect midi-file for your purpose? I&apos;ll check it out.</p><p>--Wim Hoogewerf</p></div>
