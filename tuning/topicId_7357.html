I&apos;ve always tuned the<br/>intervals to true JI to the extent desired by the tuning file used at<br/>any particular moment in the piece.</p><p>But, just for fun, I&apos;ve constructed tuning files that call for only<br/>HALF the correction from 12-tET that I&apos;ve used so far.  Thus, a major<br/>third is narrowed by 6.84 cents, to 393.16 cents, instead of the full<br/>13.69 cents, to 386.31 cents.</p><p>Here&apos;s what&apos;s wild: retuning motion and deviation from 12-tET are cut<br/>in half, but according to the model I&apos;m using, &quot;pain&quot; is proportional<br/>to motion and deviation SQUARED, so should be only 1/4 of the pain<br/>of full retuning.  The error of a half-tuned interval is half of the<br/>12-tET error, but again the model I&apos;m using correlates pain with tuning<br/>error squared, so the pain of ill-tuning should be only 1/4 of the pain<br/>of 12-tET.</p><p>Confusing?  The upshot is that I&apos;m saying the tuning should have only<br/>1/4 the retuning pain of the full JI tunings, yet should have 3/4 of<br/>the gain in well-tuned intervals.</p><p>To illustrate, I&apos;ve done the first movement of Schubert&apos;s D894 sonata<br/>in G several ways and posted them on my web site:</p><p>   <a href="http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/">http://www.idcomm.com/personal/jadl/</a></p><p>I would invite especially those who have sampled the previous tunings<br/>and found them too &quot;bouncy&quot; to give these half-tuned files a try!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=7361 href="#7361">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

IMHO, that issue is relatively unimportant.</p><p>But you ARE correct in saying that by setting the vertical deviations<br/>to zero, which I HAVE been doing, I am failing to minimize the total<br/>&quot;pain&quot;.  I already have a new model in mind that will both allow<br/>relaxation of vertical tuning from strict JI and will allow horizontal<br/>tuning to be considered.  This will also address your concerns regarding<br/>strict JI being undesirable because of phase-lock; there will<br/>essentially &quot;never&quot; be strict JI coming out of the new program (as yet<br/>unwritten!).</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;The upshot is that I&apos;m saying the tuning should have only 1/4 the<br/>&gt;&gt;retuning pain of the full JI tunings, yet should have 3/4 of the gain<br/>&gt;&gt;in well-tuned intervals.</p><p>[Paul:]<br/>&gt;That clearly goes a long way toward acheiving your original stated<br/>&gt;goal: to minimize the total &quot;pain&quot;.</p><p>Well, this particular trick is very crude; it imposes a constant factor<br/>of out-of-tuneness to the entire piece, so I don&apos;t consider it going a<br/>&quot;long way&quot; toward my goal, but it gives a hint of the fruits of<br/>considering a larger set of tradeoffs.</p><p>(Please note that achieving 1/4 the retuning pain with 3/4 of the gain<br/>in well-tuned intervals does not automatically indicate an improvement!)</p><p>JdL</p></div>
