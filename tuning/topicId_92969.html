No dice!  The second I even dropped the 5, I no longer had the impression of hearing a major chord, even with the 4 still playing.  I heard a minor 7th chord, plain as day.  Nothing &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;bright&quot; or major about the chord whatsoever.  Just for kicks, I replaced the 5th harmonic with a 7/6 above the 4th harmonic, making a subminor 7th chord, and noticed no change in emotional quality over the 4:6:7:9 chord.  The 9th harmonic did beat notably with the 7/6, though.  However, dropping the 7/6 and adding the 5th harmonic back in pulled the chord back toward a major feel (although a slightly complicated major feeling due to the 7th and 9th harmonics).</p><p>I then played it as 3:6:7:9 and noticed no real change except that the chord sounded &quot;thinner&quot;; playing the 4 really thickens up the sound in a way that no octave-doubling of any other note in the chord does.</p><p>I then compared 6:7:9 with 10:12:15 (where 10 is the same pitch as 6, and 15 the same pitch as 9).  I noticed that sure enough, the 10:12:15 sounded somewhat rougher, and also &quot;thinner&quot;, which I presume means there was less of a VF being heard.  The 10:12:15 was less &quot;restful&quot; than the 6:7:9 as well, and a little bit brighter.  I would not call it more &quot;major&quot;, and I *certainly* would not call it more minor...I might say that the emotional quality was the same between the two, but the smoothness of 6:7:9 made it a little &quot;darker&quot; or &quot;rounder&quot; sounding.</p><p>Also, with the 6:7:9 chord, I noticed that if you *don&apos;t* play the 4th harmonic, it really isn&apos;t all that obvious that the 6th harmonic isn&apos;t the root.  It&apos;s painfully obvious when you *do* play the 4th harmonic that that&apos;s the real root, but if you never had that contrast, you&apos;d probably never notice.</p><p>I also noticed an interesting phenomenon with harmonics 4:5:6: they &quot;turn into&quot; harmonics 12:15:18 if you play a note a 3/2 below the 4th harmonic.  Interesting how adding or subtracting one note can change the VF of the entire chord.</p><p>Lastly, I noticed that the more harmonics I added to a chord, the stronger the VF became but the less &quot;major&quot; it sounded.  IOW, 4:5:6:7 sounds less major than 4:5:6, 4:5:6:7:9 barely sounds major at all, and 4:5:6:7:9:11 doesn&apos;t sound even the least bit major to me.  Aren&apos;t these higher-harmonic chords more tonal than the bare 4:5:6?</p><p>So, Carl, what do you make of this?  If I still hear 6:7:9 as minor, even when played as 4:6:7:9, and if I hear it as less rough but no less minor than 10:12:15, does that mean a) that I&apos;m just a non-ideal listener, or b) that tonalness is not the ideal indicator of minorness?</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=92971 href="#92971">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2010 3:39:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So, Carl, what do you make of this?

Sharpen the 9 and you get something like<br/>the Hendrix chord, which has its own feeling, flatten it, and you get<br/>this kind of slightly mystical sound that sounds somewhat &quot;minor&quot; and<br/>more emotional when put in a musical context. You&apos;ll note that the<br/>effect predictably decreases as you alter higher and thus less<br/>significant harmonics. In fact, if you keep 4:5 the same and alter<br/>6:7:9:... (alter 8 if you want), there comes a point where the sadness<br/>will &quot;equal&quot; that of the minor triad, or at least approach it.

If you take the 9 and double it an octave or two below,<br/>as in 2.25:4.5:9:11:13, and also do the same for 10:12:15, thus making<br/>2.5:5:10:12:15, the 10:12:15 with octaves will be more concordant.</p><p>I have a theory of minorness that is related to Carl&apos;s, but differs<br/>somewhat. My theory is that detuning the harmonic series slightly<br/>causes not too much of a perceptual problem, but that detuning it<br/>significantly can make it so discordant that it becomes painful, and<br/>you want to just shut it off - unless you detune it to the extent that<br/>it becomes another part of the harmonic series. As an initial test,<br/>let&apos;s pick the global maximum of HE, around 60-70 cents, as the<br/>interval to detune things by, since it maximally confuses your brain<br/>between hearing this interval as a unison and something else. This<br/>isn&apos;t a hard and fast rule, just use it as a guideline and find the<br/>nearest most discordant sonorites possible.</p><p>Let&apos;s first see the pattern. So I&apos;m going to denote an alteration by<br/>this interval downward as &quot;b&quot; and upward as &quot;#&quot; respectively, just to<br/>give you an intuitive grasp on what I mean. Again, in each case, don&apos;t<br/>treat the 63 cents as a hard and fast rule, but rather an opportunity<br/>to explore and find the nearest &quot;maximally discordant&quot; interval. Play<br/>1 and 2 below all of these intervals. If you&apos;re in Scala, put the main<br/>dyad first and the octave equivalent notes afterward, so 1:2:3 becomes<br/>2:3:1, so you hear things in the right register. Let&apos;s see what<br/>happens:</p><p>2:3:1 - concordant<br/>2:3b:1 - discordant, ambiguous, slightly unpleasant unless you&apos;re used to it<br/>2:3#:1 - also somewhat discordant, perhaps not as much as 1:2:3b<br/>though. This is good if the 2:3 is about 2:3.1</p><p>I&apos;m not going to write the octave equivalent notes anymore, just when<br/>you play these sonorities, note that you should double the lowest note<br/>by two octaves below:<br/>4:5 - concordant<br/>4:5b - sounds minor, perhaps &quot;sad&quot; is the word you&apos;d use for this.<br/>Note that 4:5b is about 5:6, so this sonority is about 1.25:2.5:5:6</p><p>4:5:6 - concordant<br/>4:5b:6 - sounds minor, perhaps &quot;sad&quot; again<br/>4:5b:6b - even more discordant, slightly more pain being added, this<br/>is &quot;diminished&quot;. If 6 is about 5.7 it works well here.<br/>4:5:6b - we&apos;re keeping 5 unaltered but changing the less significant<br/>6, this may sound &quot;bright&quot; or &quot;exciting,&quot; but certainly slightly more<br/>perceptually &quot;painful&quot; than 4:5:6 by itself. Perhaps not enough that<br/>you&apos;d use the descriptive word &quot;painful&quot;, but the underlying concept<br/>remains similar nonetheless.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ll spare you the rest of them, but this pattern continues<br/>all up the series to present xenharmonic minor chords as well. I&apos;ll<br/>just present next the &quot;series of negativity,&quot; which you should hear as<br/>intervals that are increasingly &quot;negative&quot; in an intuitive sense. They<br/>may sound sad, then despairing, then frightening, then &quot;turn this the<br/>hell off.&quot; Here&apos;s the series:</p><p>4:5b:6 - you can make this 1/1 - 6/5 - 3/2, which is minor.<br/>4:5b:6:7# - you can make this # even sharper than 60 cents for maximum<br/>effect, presumably because of tetradic interactions I&apos;m not aware of.<br/>Try 1/1 - 6/5 - 3/2 - 27/18. (Note that if you do 4:5b:6:7b, you get<br/>something like the 7-limit utonality, which is often perceived as an<br/>&quot;extension&quot; of minor).<br/>4:5b:6:7#:9# - make the 9# something like 37/16 or 14/6, and play<br/>around by ear to get the &quot;worst&quot; note.<br/>4:5b:6:7#:9#:11# - make the 11# something like 23:16, or play by ear<br/>to get the &quot;worst&quot; note.<br/>4:5b:6:7#:9#:11#:13# - make the 13# something like 53:16, or play by<br/>ear to get the &quot;worst&quot; note. Again, you&apos;ve had fun creating maximum<br/>concordance, now try to create maximum discordance.<br/>4:5b:6:7#:9#:11#:13#:15b - make the 15b something like 11:3.<br/>4:5b:6b:7#:9#:11#:13#:15b - We just changed 6 to 6b. Make it 10:7</p><p>This should sound pretty unpleasant, and a clear extension of the<br/>&quot;minor&quot; sound into ever increasingly frightening sonorities. I<br/>recommend NOT turning the volume down as it gets worse to experience<br/>the negativity full blast. The first two have been used in 12-tet for<br/>a long time under the guise of the minor chord and the minor/maj7<br/>chord. Sharpening the D doesn&apos;t really do much in 12-tet, because you<br/>just get an octave doubling of the minor third, but chords like<br/>C-Eb-G-B-D-F# or C-Eb-G-A-D-F# are often used to sound even more<br/>hopeless than min/maj7 chords - note the F# is, itself, a sharpened<br/>11:4.</p><p>Or, more intuitively, C-E-G is major, C-Eb-G is minor, and C-Eb-Gb is<br/>diminished. Unless you can imagine the diminished chord in a more<br/>positive context (e.g. as part of the otonal 5:6:7, it won&apos;t work too<br/>well).</p><p>OK, let&apos;s have some more fun. Take that ridiculous sonority that we<br/>just had, 4:5b:6b:7#:9#:11#:13#:15b. Then let&apos;s start resolving some<br/>of the harmonics back:</p><p>4:5b:6:7#:9#:11:13:15 - resolve 6, 11, 13, and 15 back. Should sound<br/>like it&apos;s &quot;relaxing&quot; a bit, I really like the resolution here.<br/>4:5b:6:7:9:11:13:15 - resolve everything back but 5. Should sound like<br/>it&apos;s relaxing more, and chilling out.<br/>4:5:6:7:9:11:13:15 - whee!</p><p>Have fun with it. Your perception will no doubt differ from mine in<br/>the exact labels used, or additional musical context you might imagine<br/>chords in that might make them not seem &quot;as bad&quot; as me - but the<br/>concept is accurate enough on some level to warrant continuing to<br/>follow - right? :)</p><p>&gt; Michael, try this:<br/>&gt; 5:6:7 by itself<br/>&gt; vs<br/>&gt; 1.25:2.5:5:6:7<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bizarre...I hear very little difference...and what little difference I hear I figure could easily be attributed to mere presence of the extra overtones.&nbsp; I can kind of hear what you mean (if I&apos;m following correctly) by 5:6:7 pointing to a root at 1/1 and 1.25:2.5:5:6:7 pointing to a root at 5...but, mood wise, I don&apos;t feel a huge jump.</p><p>Try 5:6:7:9:11 and 1.25:5:6:7:9:11 then.
