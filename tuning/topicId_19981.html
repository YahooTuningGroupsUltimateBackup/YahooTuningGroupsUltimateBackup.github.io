But bear in mind it was not<br/>ready or finished, when it was accidently posted .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Justin White<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Justin...</p><p>Personally, I thought it was &quot;cute&quot; and could segue into concepts of<br/>&quot;Harmonic Entropy&quot; and such like for the more advanced.</p><p>I would recommend a but more &quot;conventional&quot; beginning, however.  It&apos;s<br/>a little &quot;spooky..&quot;  Kind of like, &quot;if you are reading this, maybe<br/>there&apos;s something a little wrong with you...&quot;  Maybe that&apos;s not how<br/>it was intended, but *I*, personally, had that impression and if I<br/>read anything else of a similar nature on the Internet I would feel<br/>similarly...</p><p>Just as a little aside regarding tuning and electronic music...</p><p>Back in, let&apos;s say the 1960&apos;s and so, everybody was VERY excited<br/>about the &quot;sound continuum&quot; that was electronic music.  Actually, it<br/>probably started in the 1950&apos;s with pioneers like Otto Luening (my<br/>mentor) and Varese (who once &quot;filled in&quot; for his course at<br/>Columbia...)</p><p>In fact, back in those days they would sometimes included a<br/>&quot;Halberstadt&quot;-type conventional 12-note keyboard in the electronic<br/>studios and composers would, generally, look &quot;askance&quot; at it...</p><p>Such considerations of &quot;quantifying&quot; the pitch continuum seemed, at<br/>that time, to controvert the idea of using a continuing pitch<br/>spectrum... something that electronic music was trying to do OPPOSED<br/>to the conventional 12-tET tunings with _discrete_ pitches...</p><p>I have to say that this opinion of &quot;lack of quantifying&quot; had an<br/>effect on the &quot;reputation&quot; of electronic music at that time.  It was<br/>considered by many in the conservatories to be a little &quot;under<br/>class...&quot;, not quite as &quot;sophisticated&quot; as &quot;traditional&quot; music or<br/>conventional composition...  At least, that was the feeling I<br/>garnered from several at that time.</p><p>And, there were many EXCELLENT electonic compositions from that<br/>day... although, frankly, most of them consisted of &quot;washes&quot; of sound<br/>of one kind or another.  Some were VERY attractive.  But STILL,<br/>electronic music was considered &quot;intellectually suspect&quot; in some<br/>quarters...</p><p>Of course, nowadays everything has changed, and computerized<br/>synthesizers allow us to explore the entire continuum in a<br/>QUANTIFIABLE way...</p><p>I belive this will (if it hasn&apos;t ALREADY) change the underclass<br/>&quot;reputation&quot; of electronic music.</p><p>Quite possibly, electronic music, and tuning studies can and will be<br/>as sophisticated or even MORE sophisticated than ANYTHING produced in<br/>our historical past...</p><p>_________ ______ _____ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=20001 href="#20001">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>3/9/2001 12:27:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>What you are talking about, in general, in this post, I have never<br/>been able to understand:</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; Just as a little aside regarding tuning and electronic music...</p><p>...and you have continued references to</p><p>&gt; composers would, generally, look &quot;askance&quot; at it...</p><p>...and</p><p>&gt; I have to say that this opinion of &quot;lack of quantifying&quot; had an<br/>&gt; effect on the &quot;reputation&quot; of electronic music</p><p>...and</p><p>&gt; not quite as &quot;sophisticated&quot;</p><p>...and</p><p>&gt; electronic music was considered &quot;intellectually suspect&quot;</p><p>Well, and this is one human&apos;s opinion, I have never for one day<br/>written music that *I* wanted to write (as opposed to music written<br/>for an expressed [i.e. commissioned or on spec] purpose) that I felt<br/>needed to be justified, sophisticated, acceptable, or in any way<br/>legitimate.</p><p>I realize that everyone makes/writes music for different purposes,<br/>but my hat is off to the ones that don&apos;t give a tinker&apos;s damn about<br/>acceptance, and my condolences to those who feel the need to fill the<br/>above &apos;requirements&apos; of conforming.</p><p>Where are the renegades and mavericks when you need &apos;em?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=20003 href="#20003">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>3/9/2001 12:38:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JSZANTO@A... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Where are the renegades and mavericks when you need &apos;em?</p><p>This is Jacky Ligon.

I was never able to create the works that, at &gt;that time, excited me the most...</p><p>I am sorry for that. When an undergraduate at SDSU (a school I am not proud of for it&apos;s great music dept but attended because the Partch ensemble was at this institution) it was the same situation. What I did was first put up a huge fuss to get attention to the situation, and then did all manner of studio internship and whatnot, constantly coming in during the closing hours, until they had to _let_ me at the machines, just like the early generation of programmers (circa Bill Gates writing DOS and BASIC). Spent many a wee hour with the huge Buchla system, trying to find out how Morton Subotnik did all those cool things. But I digress...</p><p>&gt;THEN, the instructors at the school &quot;did a number on me&quot; regarding &gt;electronic music.  They conveyed the impression that it had a certain kind &gt;of &quot;second class&quot; status and that I should continue my compositional &gt;studies in more &quot;traditional&quot; forms.</p><p>Then they screwed you royally. Whether you should have listened to them in the first place is not my call.</p><p>&gt;I went along with the studies, because I believe... perhaps others &gt;disagree... that formal compositional study with accomplished teachers of &gt;composition is a beneficial situation.</p><p>There are good composers that have studied, as well. In and of itself, studying composition is not a good or bad decision, but teachers themselves can vary a great deal, no?</p><p>And then there are those that strike out on their own.</p><p>&gt;By the time I was done, &quot;electronic music&quot; had been &quot;drilled out of me&quot; &gt;and when I FINALLY had access to the studio, I didn&apos;t want to do it any more.</p><p>This is really too bad. Me, I&apos;d harbor a very great animosity towards the people that exhibited the hubris to talk a young man out of following his muse. They owe you, you know it?</p><p>&gt;OK... so that&apos;s a bad story about academia... but it was part of my &gt;experience and it MADE a difference in how I was composing and what I &gt;wanted to do.</p><p>Yes, apparently it did.</p><p>&gt;Should I have ignored everybody&apos;s opinion?  Should I just have not gone to &gt;school?</p><p>Well, what do *you* think, in retrospect? It doesn&apos;t sound to me like you are a person who, by nature, strikes out in the opposite direction, so you must have been doing what you thought was right. And at that age, we&apos;re _all_ learning.</p><p>&gt;Surely I can&apos;t believe that a LACK of musical education is going to make a &gt;fine composer.</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>As to my comments on Yale, I should preface that it stuck in my head that a former, and talented, member of this list was at Yale, and had a hell of a time getting anyone to pay attention to anything microtonal, *unless* it was cloaked in the most conventional of settings. And Partch? He said when he tried to play stuff like that they all laughed.</p><p>We&apos;ll see who laughs last!</p><p>&gt;Jon Szanto, you couldn&apos;t have picked a WORSE example.  Yale University has &gt;one of the most &quot;maverick&quot; composition departments in the country!</p><p>Oh, I&apos;m sure I could have picked a worse example, but what I didn&apos;t do was mention that I was speaking in generalist terms, while being reminded of the above composer; don&apos;t think my remarks were intrinsically tied to YU. But honestly, Joe, there _is_ a difference between the most *outside* people within such Ivy Halls, and the people outside. More below...</p><p>&gt;Have you heard of Martin Bresnick??  He&apos;s a wild man!</p><p>No, but I will check him out on your recommendation; on the other hand:</p><p>1. I consider myself pretty aware of the new music scene, and I&apos;m not familiar -- maybe he is somewhat regional?</p><p>2. I consider &quot;wild&quot; more like Tom Waits. Bresnick better be ready to rumble.</p><p>&gt;At Yale, they instituted a performing group called &quot;Wolves in Sheeps &gt;Clothing&quot; or something of the like.  They would give wacky concerts all night!</p><p>Means not much. I&apos;m pretty versed on the lineage of performing groups that are considered outside of the mainstream: Bang On A Can (and the All-Stars), Icebreaker, Composers in Red Sneakers (is that correct?), Eighth Blackbird, and all the various composer-led groups (Louis Andriessen&apos;s ensembles, Paul Dresher, Michael Nyman, etc.). But don&apos;t they all pretty much play concerts in concert halls playing music that is trying to break out. Have they succeeded? Dunno, let&apos;s see...</p><p>&gt;Have you heard of David Lang??  Have you heard of BANG ON A CAN?</p><p>Yes, and have played &quot;The Anvil Chorus&quot;, which is quite fun; I imagine he would have written David Lang music wherever he went to school, or even if he didn&apos;t go to school. And I am friends and colleagues with Steven Schick of BOAC, and have witnessed their performances here. I like what they do, for the most part.</p><p>&gt;The &quot;Bang on a Canners&quot; are DIRECT descendents of the Bresnick &quot;wild bunch.&quot;</p><p>I really don&apos;t know what your point is, as I don&apos;t consider them to be as ground-breaking as you do. What is it that they do that is so different? They:</p><p>1. play concerts, first in lofts and alternate spaces, more often in concert halls and universities (they were going to be up at UCLA, which I noticed when I visited the campus the other day), more power to them for making careers out of it.</p><p>2. play music that is not all that different from much of the earlier &apos;avant&apos; stuff, except they try and add some of the volume and grit from a &quot;rock sensibility&quot; to what they do. It&apos;s possible that Howard Hanson and Ned Rorem would be offended/shocked, but it is a heck of a lot closer to Boulez and Ferneyhough then it is to Pearl Jam and the Art Ensemble of Chicago. Considering working within the modern concert-and-grant situation, they are probably as out as they can go.</p><p>I just happen to think that there are people who have stepped outside, have not felt fear of *not* appeasing the academe, have chosen different vehicles and venues -- outside the lines -- that make these examples somewhat pallid.</p><p>I guess my point is simply this: the halls of learning are a fine and wonderful place, but you point to examples of rebellion as what can happen there, and it seems to me the thrust is *against* the institution. Which begs the question: why be there in the first place?

At least it&apos;s *Romantic* bullshit!</p><p>&gt;They why don&apos;t we all go &quot;starve ourselves,&quot; live in garrets, and come &gt;down with tuberculosis... That, surely, is the way, then, to write &gt;superior music...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t buy it.</p><p>I don&apos;t believe my stance went nearly that overboard, so the hyperbole is all yours.</p><p>&gt;Jon, you self-confessed fuddy-duddy, you!  Now you go off to work in the &gt;orchestra where you probably will be performing 19th century Romantic &gt;repertoire, which is about all orchestras do... Well, that and &gt;Beethoven... early Romantic. Maybe that&apos;s where you&apos;re getting this turn &gt;of the century Romantic viewpoint!</p><p>That, my good friend, is my *job*. It is not *me*. It is presumptuous of you to know my repertoire (three premieres so far this season), to think that an orchestra is my only musical outlet (not to mention that my musical values were formed long ago), that, that...</p><p>No, this is about the kind of music-making I feel is important and will have a lasting effect; at that, it is about as personal a statement as I can make, and can&apos;t be applied to any other soul. I know what moves me, both in performing and composing (and listening, I suppose). What I am trying to understand is why you seem so unsure of your own methods/motivations in making music, and why you need the concurrence of others to validate those methods/motivations.</p><p>Wanna experiment with scales?

They conveyed the impression that it had a<br/>certain kind of &quot;second class&quot; status and that I should continue my<br/>compositional studies in more &quot;traditional&quot; forms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then they screwed you royally. Whether you should have listened to<br/>them in the first place is not my call.<br/>&gt;</p><p>A 20-year old student is still an &quot;apprentice.&quot;  Of course, I<br/>understand that *you* always know and knew everything to a much<br/>greater degree than any &quot;instructor...&quot;  So, of course, you would<br/>elicit a different kind of behavior.</p><p>Most 18-year olds behave the same way.  Are you sure you&apos;re not 18,<br/>Jon??</p><p>&gt; &gt;I went along with the studies, because I believe... perhaps others<br/>&gt; &gt;disagree... that formal compositional study with accomplished<br/>teachers of composition is a beneficial situation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are good composers that have studied, as well.</p><p>OHMYGOD.

I have,<br/>unfortunately, never run across it...</p><p>&gt; &gt;By the time I was done, &quot;electronic music&quot; had been &quot;drilled out<br/>of me&quot; and when I FINALLY had access to the studio, I didn&apos;t want to<br/>do it any more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is really too bad. Me, I&apos;d harbor a very great animosity<br/>towards the people that exhibited the hubris to talk a young man out<br/>of following his muse. They owe you, you know it?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Pourquoi?  They were the TEACHER, *I* the STUDENT, not the &quot;other<br/>way&quot; around.  But, of course for the &quot;self-taught&quot; geniuses this does<br/>not apply, naturally.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Should I have ignored everybody&apos;s opinion?  Should I just have not<br/>gone to school?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, what do *you* think, in retrospect? It doesn&apos;t sound to me<br/>like you are a person who, by nature, strikes out in the opposite<br/>direction,</p><p>Now I think you are being also a little &quot;presumptuous,&quot; yes??</p><p>&gt;so you must have been doing what you thought was right. And at that<br/>age, we&apos;re _all_ learning.<br/>&gt;</p><p>That statement doesn&apos;t make ANY sense in light of what you were<br/>saying before.</p><p>&gt; As to my comments on Yale, I should preface that it stuck in my<br/>head that a former, and talented, member of this list was at Yale,<br/>and<br/>had a hell of a time getting anyone to pay attention to anything<br/>microtonal, *unless* it was cloaked in the most conventional of<br/>settings. And Partch? He said when he tried to play stuff like that<br/>they all laughed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;ll see who laughs last!<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well... it&apos;s hard to believe that it would be that restrictive, but,<br/>I only speak &quot;secondhandedly&quot; since I was never there...</p><p>&gt; But honestly, Joe, there _is_ a difference between the most<br/>*outside* people within such Ivy Halls, and the people outside. More<br/>below...<br/>&gt;</p><p>So what.  Maybe you just like a different set of composers than I<br/>do...  Not a big deal.</p><p>I like composers with a little &quot;technique.&quot;  You know, there *IS*<br/>such a thing, Jon!</p><p>&gt; &gt;Have you heard of Martin Bresnick??  He&apos;s a wild man!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, but I will check him out on your recommendation;</p><p>He won a &quot;Mac Arthur &apos;genius&apos;&quot; grant of $500,000 and is composing<br/>full time.  It was in all the newspapers.  Jon, you must not read the<br/>newspaper.</p><p>on the other hand:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. I consider myself pretty aware of the new music scene, and I&apos;m<br/>not familiar -- maybe he is somewhat regional?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I suppose, Jon, that the East Coast would be considered &quot;regional&quot; to<br/>you.  So, in that sense, yes.</p><p>&gt; 2. I consider &quot;wild&quot; more like Tom Waits.</p><p>You can listen to Waits, and I&apos;ll listen to Partch.  That&apos;s fine with<br/>me.  Better pass me a beer, too, so I can get through it...</p><p>&gt; &gt;Have you heard of David Lang??  Have you heard of BANG ON A CAN?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, and have played &quot;The Anvil Chorus&quot;, which is quite fun;</p><p>Well, of course, you&apos;re a percussionist, so you&apos;re sure to like that<br/>one.... Good</p><p>&gt;I imagine he would have written David Lang music wherever he went to<br/>school, or even if he didn&apos;t go to school.</p><p>So, you have to agree that he is a Yale product *and* a maverick, yes?</p><p>He is quite an astonishing composer...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I really don&apos;t know what your point is, as I don&apos;t consider them to<br/>be as ground-breaking as you do. What is it that they do that is so<br/>different? They:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. play concerts, first in lofts and alternate spaces, more often<br/>in concert halls and universities (they were going to be up at UCLA,<br/>which I noticed when I visited the campus the other day), more power<br/>to them for  making careers out of it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, OK... so we should all hold our concerts in vacant lots.  Jon,<br/>do you take out the &quot;trash&quot; first, or leave it there for the audience<br/>to sit on??  :)</p><p>&gt; 2. play music that is not all that different from much of the<br/>earlier &apos;avant&apos; stuff, except they try and add some of the volume and<br/>grit from a rock sensibility&quot; to what they do. It&apos;s possible that<br/>Howard Hanson and Ned Rorem would be offended/shocked, but it is a<br/>heck of a lot closer to Boulez and Ferneyhough then it is to Pearl<br/>Jam and the Art Ensemble of Chicago.</p><p>And the &quot;Art Ensemble of Chicago&quot; is *not* really all that close to<br/>Partch... unless I have my ears on wrong.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just happen to think that there are people who have stepped<br/>outside, have not felt fear of *not* appeasing the academe, have<br/>chosen different vehicles and venues -- outside the lines -- that<br/>make these examples somewhat pallid.<br/>&gt;</p><p>What makes you think that anytime someone steps &quot;outside&quot; they are<br/>accomplishing something?  Sure, Partch was a genius, but for every<br/>Partch there are a thousand &quot;imposters&quot; and &quot;diettantes.&quot;</p><p>They&apos;re all over the place, since it&apos;s so easy to be an &quot;artiste.&quot;</p><p>&gt; I guess my point is simply this: the halls of learning are a fine<br/>and wonderful place, but you point to examples of rebellion as what<br/>can happen there, and it seems to me the thrust is *against* the<br/>institution. Which begs the question: why be there in the first<br/>place? (Hint: they really aren&apos;t subversives...)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Jon, I don&apos;t buy this.  I believe that *most* composers who undertake<br/>a rigorous study in universities are SUPERIOR composers to the<br/>&quot;outsiders.&quot;</p><p>I say MOST... there are a &quot;few&quot; exceptions like Partch, but they are<br/>&quot;exceptions&quot; rather than the rule.</p><p>And, just being an &quot;outsider&quot; means NOTHING in my view.  One might<br/>just as easily be an &quot;imposter&quot; or &quot;fraud.&quot;  They&apos;re all over the<br/>place, Jon.</p><p>On this topic, as usual, we are never going to agree...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Jon, you self-confessed fuddy-duddy, you!  Now you go off to work<br/>in the orchestra where you probably will be performing 19th century<br/>Romantic repertoire, which is about all orchestras do... Well, that<br/>and Beethoven... early Romantic. Maybe that&apos;s where you&apos;re getting<br/>this turn of the century Romantic viewpoint!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That, my good friend, is my *job*. It is not *me*.</p><p>AHA!  So where is the &quot;rebellious outsider&quot; here??  Do you think<br/>Partch would have played that repertoire??</p><p>I, personally, ADMIRE you for this, but my perception is that you&apos;re<br/>more &quot;tied into&quot; THE SYSTEM than *I* am!  The joke is on YOU, Jon!</p><p>&gt;I know what moves me, both in performing and composing (and<br/>listening, I suppose). What I am trying to understand is why you seem<br/>so unsure of your own methods/motivations in making music, and why<br/>you<br/>need the concurrence of others to validate those methods/motivations.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Well, as usual, I will take that as an insult, and also as another<br/>&quot;presumptuous&quot; statement.  But I &quot;consider the source&quot; as it were.</p><p>YOU don&apos;t care about anybody else&apos;s evaluations, because you are just<br/>TOO GOOD for them.  And you also KNOW EVERYTHING.</p><p>You are the typical 17 year old who never grew up, Jon.  I had you 18<br/>before in the above, but I reduced it by one year...</p><p>&gt; Wanna experiment with scales? Go ahead, knock yourself out!

I see, you&apos;re saying I&apos;m<br/>interested in microtonality now because it&apos;s suddenly now the<br/>&quot;Zeitgeist...&quot;</p><p>Well, I don&apos;t know... perhaps you&apos;re right.  The first sensible thing<br/>you&apos;ve said.  I&apos;ll have to think about it.</p><p>Microtonality is now so &quot;establishment&quot; that YOU YOURSELF now, Jon,<br/>are part of the &quot;establishment.&quot;</p><p>So what are you going to do about that now??</p><p>Well, I suggest maybe going out and robbing some old ladies for<br/>starters...</p><p>&gt; Please: this is all in the best of healthy dialogue,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt; &grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>&gt; Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>&gt;                           <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p><p>Jon, we *ALWAYS* disagree, so this is nothing new.</p><p>I always *enjoy* our discussions, especially when they&apos;re &quot;no holds<br/>barred!&quot;</p><p>Anyway, I think we&apos;re &quot;past&quot; insulting each other at this point... so<br/>that&apos;s an &quot;evolution&quot; of sorts.</p><p>Actually, I &quot;enjoyed&quot; this one.

Most days I try to be a blend of the best of both ages.</p><p>&gt; &gt; There are good composers that have studied, as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;OHMYGOD.  Amazing to come from *your* pen...</p><p>You have misread my writings: I have never said, nor implied, that studying (composition) is a bad thing.</p><p>&gt;Of course, *you* and Harry Partch.  Jon, I should get more of your &gt;music....  Where is it published, where recorded??  I have, unfortunately, &gt;never run across it...</p><p>I am far less an outsider than HP, as well as many other composers. The music I have composed, such as it is, has either been in a commercially useable form, or for very personal projects. Most of my performed works have been for choreographic use, and the few pieces of &apos;absolute&apos; music are self-published. I don&apos;t seek a name as a composer because, frankly, it isn&apos;t my main interest in life, and others are far more accomplished.</p><p>&gt;Pourquoi?  They were the TEACHER, *I* the STUDENT, not the &quot;other way&quot; &gt;around.  But, of course for the &quot;self-taught&quot; geniuses this does not &gt;apply, naturally.</p><p>I hope the second comment is not meant to be applied to me, but my point on the first was very clear: you expressed an interest (in electronics), and they quashed it, for very specious reasons. By the time you had a chance to try, the desire was gone. A teacher is there to open minds, not close them, and in this case your instructors did you a great and deep disservice.</p><p>That, of course, is my opinion. But here you are, ready to embark on lectures (and performances) in the near future, on electronic music. You mentioned recently that you hadn&apos;t been doing it that long -- wouldn&apos;t it have been great if you had been allowed to start when you first wanted to?</p><p>&gt; &gt; It doesn&apos;t sound to me like you are a person who, by nature, strikes &gt; out in the opposite direction,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now I think you are being also a little &quot;presumptuous,&quot; yes??</p><p>Yes, I suppose I was. It was my distinct impression of you from your writings, but I could very well be wrong. And wrong to assume, certainly.</p><p>&gt; &gt;And at that age, we&apos;re _all_ learning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That statement doesn&apos;t make ANY sense in light of what you were saying &gt;before.</p><p>I believe it does. At that young stage in your life you didn&apos;t see any value in &apos;taking on&apos; the professors that would choose to limit you rather than let you grow. In spite of that, I&apos;m sure you learned other things.</p><p>&gt;I like composers with a little &quot;technique.&quot;  You know, there *IS* such a &gt;thing, Jon!</p><p>Of course, and there are many composers and arrangers that profoundly impress and delight me for those very skills. Again, nothing I have said invalidates compositional prowess and craft.</p><p>[About Mr. Bresnik]<br/>&gt;He won a &quot;Mac Arthur &apos;genius&apos;&quot; grant of $500,000 and is composing full &gt;time.  It was in all the newspapers.  Jon, you must not read the newspaper.</p><p>&lt;sigh&gt; Joe, while I&apos;m sure the most recent recipients of the Mac grants were covered in Reuters and AP, to chastise me for not noticing and remembering one name in an article is a bit silly. In my local paper, I don&apos;t recall an article on Mr. Bresnik, singularly, at all. In the music world, to be well read, I subscribe to the New Yorker (for concert info), BBC Music Magazine, and am a member of Chamber Music America; I also keep current with online resources such as NewMusicBox, though mostly when the subject materials interest me.</p><p>So I went online: found 6 recordings of his music, only two that are only his works. One is older string quartet music; the newer is of interest (&quot;Opere della Musica Povera&quot;), and I&apos;ve ordered it. I guess he wasn&apos;t on my radar, as a well-known composer, but apparently some of his students are.</p><p>&gt;I suppose, Jon, that the East Coast would be considered &quot;regional&quot; to you.</p><p>Most definitely -- it&apos;s a big country. European cultures and trends (for example) have developed, in distinct fashions, in far smaller geographical distances than we have between our coasts.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes, and have played &quot;The Anvil Chorus&quot;, which is quite fun;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Well, of course, you&apos;re a percussionist, so you&apos;re sure to like that one....</p><p>I tend to dislike most &quot;percussion music&quot;, as the bulk of it pretty much defines the term &quot;oxymoron&quot;.</p><p>&gt;So, you have to agree that he is a Yale product *and* a maverick, yes?</p><p>I don&apos;t happen think he is *that* much of a maverick, so we&apos;re splitting hairs.</p><p>&gt;He is quite an astonishing composer...</p><p>For me, good in small doses. What I like best about him is that he refuses to address the same compositional questions that have been pretty well answered over the past few centuries.</p><p>&gt;And the &quot;Art Ensemble of Chicago&quot; is *not* really all that close to &gt;Partch... unless I have my ears on wrong.</p><p>You miss my point: it&apos;s not about listening, or the literal &apos;music&apos; itself. It is an attitude, a belief in the way of writing, performing, and living a music. In this instance, AEoC, and Sun Ra for that matter, are certainly closer to Partch and other &apos;outsider&apos; music. I&apos;ve been fortunate to see both groups play, and it was much more than a &apos;musical&apos; experience. This does not invalidate my enjoyable experiences at a string quartet concert, in a lovely chamber music hall.</p><p>&gt;What makes you think that anytime someone steps &quot;outside&quot; they are<br/>&gt;accomplishing something?</p><p>I did not, at any point, say &quot;anytime&quot; or &quot;anyone&quot;. There are no guarantees, so please don&apos;t put words or ideas in my stead.</p><p>&gt;Sure, Partch was a genius, but for every Partch there are a thousand &gt;&quot;imposters&quot; and &quot;diettantes.&quot; They&apos;re all over the place, since it&apos;s so &gt;easy to be an &quot;artiste.&quot;</p><p>I can&apos;t necessarily disagree, but I find far greater numbers of vacant imposters in the realm of &apos;art&apos; music. In most of the other disciplines, be it jazz, experimental, communal music -- they don&apos;t have the support systems, and they have to produce or cease to exist. &quot;Artistes&quot;? I work with them all the time, to my increasing shame!</p><p>&gt;Jon, I don&apos;t buy this.  I believe that *most* composers who undertake a &gt;rigorous study in universities are SUPERIOR composers to the &quot;outsiders.&quot;</p><p>As Mr. Lechter says, &quot;Okey-dokey&quot;. We disagree.</p><p>&gt;AHA!  So where is the &quot;rebellious outsider&quot; here??  Do you think Partch &gt;would have played that repertoire?? I, personally, ADMIRE you for this, &gt;but my perception is that you&apos;re more &quot;tied into&quot; THE SYSTEM than *I* &gt;am!  The joke is on YOU, Jon!</p><p>You are profoundly mistaken about me, Joe, and I&apos;m sorry you feel this way. THE SYSTEM doesn&apos;t own my soul, nor does any other employer; as I said, it&apos;s a job, though I try to do it well. If I didn&apos;t have this kind of job, it would be something else, and it would still serve to further my &apos;other&apos; activities.</p><p>But thanks for thinking it&apos;s all a joke.</p><p>I then said:</p><p>&gt; &gt;I know what moves me, both in performing and composing (and listening, I &gt; suppose). What I am trying to understand is why you seem so unsure of &gt; your own methods/motivations in making music, and why you need the &gt; concurrence of others to validate those methods/motivations.</p><p>...and you replied:</p><p>&gt;Well, as usual, I will take that as an insult, and also as another<br/>&gt;&quot;presumptuous&quot; statement.  But I &quot;consider the source&quot; as it were.</p><p>I wish you hadn&apos;t taken it as an insult. You previously said:<br/>- to JdL: &quot;Oh come on, John... Not even a &quot;little bitty bit&quot; on my side??&quot;<br/>- to Dan: &quot;Is there anyone willing or interested in defending the OPPOSITE view??&quot; &quot;Is it defensible??&quot; &quot;If it can&apos;t be defended, then I guess it&apos;s &quot;game, set, match...&quot; pun fully intended!&quot; &quot;Anyone else willing to take the other side??&quot;</p><p>These very statements are what led me to think &quot;Joseph is feeling unsure that his &apos;pre-compositional&apos; explorations are a valid pursuit, and is looking for the support of others.&quot; But you compose a lot, and you get performances, and you are lecturing. You don&apos;t need others, it seems to me, but I shouldn&apos;t presume *that*, either. I certainly hope, as I hoped before, that it doesn&apos;t insult you: in my thick-headed way, I&apos;m trying to say that you don&apos;t need anyone else to validate your methodology, because it is working for you.</p><p>If your statements above should have not led me to the conclusion I did arrive at, I am sorry for presuming. But I think a fair reading of your words would tend to make someone wonder the same way as I.</p><p>&gt;YOU don&apos;t care about anybody else&apos;s evaluations, because you are just<br/>&gt;TOO GOOD for them.  And you also KNOW EVERYTHING.</p><p>I ended my message with the sentiment that if you have a way to work, then do it, and revel in the fact that it is *your* chosen way for making *your* music. I cherish that in everyone who is creative, from the meekest amateur to the most accomplished professional. I do care, I&apos;m not too good, and I don&apos;t know everything.</p><p>(...and that just came out sounding like Stuart Smalley!)</p><p>But I&apos;m sorry you feel the way you do, and I&apos;m only replying so that maybe others will see it a little differently.</p><p>&gt;You are the typical 17 year old who never grew up, Jon.  I had you 18 &gt;before in the above, but I reduced it by one year...</p><p>??? What did I do to deserve this?</p><p>&gt;Microtonality is now so &quot;establishment&quot; that YOU YOURSELF now, Jon, are &gt;part of the &quot;establishment.&quot;</p><p>Microtonality is far from being establishment, and I have never considered myself a microtonalist. I refuse to be limited by such a term.</p><p>Joseph, I hope my explanations have shown that I wrote with no animosity attached to the words, and no insulting tone intended. Where we vary in our choices, musical and otherwise, that will continue. Where we agree is more important: that music, and musical activities, are a profound and powerful endeavor.</p><p>EOF,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=20080 href="#20080">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/10/2001 7:02:20 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Jonathan Szanto &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19981.html#20076">/tuning/topicId_19981.html#20076</a></p><p>&gt; Joseph, I hope my explanations have shown that I wrote with no<br/>animosity  attached to the words, and no insulting tone intended.<br/>Where we vary in our choices, musical and otherwise, that will<br/>continue.

I&apos;m very happy, Jon, that you&apos;ve &quot;come to your senses&quot; as it<br/>were and have decided to debate formally our concerns rather than<br/>just go off &quot;in a huff...&quot;</p><p>That&apos;s all I was asking.  Look, Jon, you were really &quot;dishing it<br/>out,&quot; in fact, you STARTED it... with the questioning, rather POINTED<br/>I must say, of my attitudes as ONLY A POOR STUDENT studying<br/>electronic music in a pretty conservative institution.  I did what I<br/>could, but I was only a KID!  I was just trying to learn, not set the<br/>University on fire (literally) at the age of 20!  I wasn&apos;t really<br/>READY to throw everything overboard... I hadn&apos;t even LEARNED it yet!</p><p>By the way, I have always found that the academic &quot;chronology&quot; is<br/>totally wrong.  They make you study HARMONY, when you want to write<br/>your OWN harmonies, and they try to shove all kinds of OTHER stuff<br/>down the throat BEFORE one is really ready for it as a composer.</p><p>The kind of music I am interested in... and, admittedly, it may be a<br/>little on the &quot;conservative&quot; end in your view, even though I am VERY<br/>interested in xenharmonics presently, DOES use elements of<br/>traditional harmony and counterpoint, but I needed those studies and<br/>courses AFTER I had done a substantial amount of composing.</p><p>That&apos;s the way a course of instruction for composers should be<br/>designed... you get the theory WHEN you need it, not before!  Even<br/>Satie went back to study counterpoint at the age of 40!  It&apos;s better<br/>that way... when you ALREADY have your own voice.</p><p>So in THAT sense, I think I&apos;m being &quot;independent&quot; although it may or<br/>may not be &quot;radical&quot; enough for your view...</p><p>Anyway, we&apos;re all friends here... and we should be able to debate<br/>vigorously WITHOUT acrimony.  If any such has appeared in my debate<br/>with you, I sincerely apologize.  Sometimes such things happen in the<br/>&quot;heat&quot; of discussion, but I agree one should watch out for them...</p><p>Regarding my academic associations, lest anyone feel I am<br/>&quot;besmirched&quot; by academic associations, I should proudly proclaim that<br/>I have never, ever been offered any kind of job in academia, part<br/>time, full time, or even as an ADJUNCT!  I am pure as the driven<br/>&quot;snow.&quot;</p><p>(Also I just learned that Kraig Grady has a knife, so I would like to<br/>be quick to make this point clear...)</p><p>Thanks again for your willingness to continue the discussion.  I<br/>would reply again point by point, but I think list participants can<br/>get a sense of where we both stand or don&apos;t stand by what we have<br/>already written.  If they&apos;re really smart, they won&apos;t even be reading<br/>this drivel...</p><p>So, again, thanks for continuing the discussion.  I&apos;ve &quot;enjoyed&quot; it,<br/>such as such things can be, and I hope we can continue such again in<br/>the future... I agree we should try to avoid &quot;personal&quot; issues in the<br/>process.</p><p>(See you out in back 12PM behind my apartment building...)</p><p>(Just joking)</p><p>Best,</p><p>_______ _____ ______ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=20126 href="#20126">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2001 8:32:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote,</p><p>&lt;&lt;I believe that *most* composers who undertake a rigorous study in<br/>universities are SUPERIOR composers to the &quot;outsiders.&quot;&gt;&gt;</p><p>If you mean composer only in the formal capital &quot;c&quot; sense then I&apos;d<br/>guess that&apos;s probably quite true too.
