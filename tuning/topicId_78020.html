If the sound is complex, overlapping of the sounds from the single strings prevents from identifyng the zero-crossing points of the single waveshapes; this is why it is usable only with one-note sounds. The case of harpsichord is even more complicated by the fact that decay of the strings&apos; sound is fast, expecially in the treble section, so the possible accuracy is reduced.<br/>Maybe it is possible to obtain purer, suitable sounds by applying sound filtering with very narrow parameters, but I never tried it, so I cannot say.<br/>If you like, please send me the recording, or part of it, so I can give it a look.</p><p>Tom wrote:<br/>&gt;Concerning a possible &apos;LP wobble&apos; problem, it might be interesting to:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;1) take the next 3 tones, since the opening chromatic scale goes over<br/>&gt;more than an octave (15 notes in total I think), and see how<br/>&gt;accurately the octaves come out<br/>&gt;2) split each tone into 2, or at least the longer tones, and see<br/>&gt;whether there is any significant difference in frequency between the<br/>&gt;two halves, this gives you some idea what the uncertainty in the<br/>&gt;frequency measurement is.</p><p>On next Sunday, I have some time to dedicate, hopefully; I&apos;ll try it.</p><p>&gt;Since each note lasts about half a second, I think it is unlikely the<br/>&gt;frequency determination can be accurate to better than 0.1Hz.</p><p>As far as I can say, accuracy should be around 0.05 or so; take into account that I used only a fraction (more or less 1/3) of the notes for the calculation.

Your methodology is very interesting. Could you please<br/>   explain more about the software that you use and how budding<br/>   musicologists might use your methods to investigate mp3 files<br/>   which are freely available on the internet. Any software which<br/>   gives an accuracy of plus or minus 6cents has to be given serious<br/>   consideration.</p></div>
