I agree the spelling<br/>with 1 s is the correct one. I also now have a better idea of<br/>what your original meaning was for this term, that for you<br/>it is not so much about being on a fence than being in awe ...</p><p>Ambisonance to my way of thinking intuitively leads more<br/>to the notion Jaques described in his response, which is along<br/>the lines of my use of &apos;ambi&apos; for intervals called &apos;neutral&apos; by<br/>others. I&apos;ll have to elaborate more in response to Jacques&apos;s<br/>latest message when I have more time.</p><p>Cris, I would never presume to suggest changing something<br/>you have been using for 30-odd years to my way of thinking,<br/>but at the same time, I wonder if maybe a better word for<br/>the phenomenon you describe would use a prefix<br/>expressing transcendence, rather than uncertainty? This<br/>is why the word Suprasonance comes to my mind. I offer it<br/>here as an alternative. I was worried for a moment that<br/>Yasser had maybe used it for his Supra-Diatonic system,<br/>but the word Suprasonance does not appear in the glossary<br/>of his book (although a huge number of other musical terms<br/>using &apos;supra&apos; are there). I think it&apos;s fair game.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron<br/>=====</p><p>My conception is more along the lines</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;c_ml_forster&quot; &lt;cris.forster@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello Daniel and Jacques,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for writing.

Also, &apos;ambi&apos; is not so much<br/>&gt; &gt; an &apos;uncertainty&apos; as I said, but rather a &apos;double-ness&apos; - that<br/>&gt; &gt; being of two things at once. Since your definition doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; seem to be on two sides, but rather above, for me the term<br/>&gt; &gt; using &apos;supra&apos; or something similar ... Supersonance says the<br/>&gt; &gt; same and maybe is better because &apos;super&apos; is used more<br/>&gt; &gt; commonly in traditional music theory whereas &apos;supra&apos; brings<br/>&gt; &gt; Yasser to mind, at least for me and probably anyone else<br/>&gt; &gt; who has read Yasser.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Aaron<br/>&gt; &gt; ====<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;c_ml_forster&quot; &lt;cris.forster@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello Daniel and Jacques,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for writing. I noticed that you spelled this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; new word with only one &grave;s&apos;: as in &grave;ambisonance&apos;. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like this spelling very much. The reason I included<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; two s&apos;s is that I wanted to avoid the pronunciation of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a long &grave;i&apos;. But, clearly, to achieve the pronunciation<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of a short &grave;i&apos;, the second &grave;s&apos; is not necessary. So,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks again.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello also to Aaron,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, your description &quot;. . . wonder is a gift of being<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; . . .&quot; very much resonates with my first encounters<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with non-tempered tunings.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; When I first began to tune my hand-hewn acoustic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instruments, I was overwhelmed by what I was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hearing. I was stunned and unable to categorize my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; aural experiences into the standard two packages:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; consonance or dissonance.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So, more than thirty years ago, I coined the term<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &grave;ambisonance&apos; to give definition to what I do not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fully understand, even though I comprehend the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematical ratios and musical interval classes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; very well. This basic experience of wonder<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; continues to this day; it is the primary inspiration of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; my art and work.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am loathe to discuss specifics simply because the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; experience of ambisonance cannot be isolated from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; timbre and, of course, from a musical context as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; well. However, I mostly experience ambisonance in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the outer 11- and 13-limits of my tonality diamond,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and in the music I have composed where I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intentionally avoid a tonal center, or a sense of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;key.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I also coined the term as an intentional barrier<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; against pseudo-intellectuals and pseudo-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; academics who insist that given this or that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;authentic&quot; tuning all can be explained.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ambisonance in a discovery! It is a flying in the face<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of convention by all creative artists. Sure, one, two,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or three hundred years later we may easily identify<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; trends in any art. But, in all the arts there are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; moments of dawn and twilight when two worlds<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intersect, and I am not at all sure whether any art<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would exist if this intersection is not one of many<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; primary inspirations.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Cris Forster<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The original definitions with the better spelling:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ambisonance: from the Greek &quot;amphi-&quot; as in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; amphibian, and from the Latin &quot;ambi-&quot; as in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ambidextrous, these two prefixes literally mean &grave;on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; both sides&apos;. Then for me, figuratively, these two<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; prefixes mean &grave;partaking of two worlds&apos;. Hence, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; musical experience of ambisonance, the source<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that inspires new ways to hear, and then new ways<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to tune and to compose.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ambisonance is the experience of hearing with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; awe; hearing the familiar for the first time, with the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sudden realization that what is heard is neither a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; consonance nor a dissonance.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ambisonance is the experience of theory and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; practice combined, yet also of theory and practice<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; transcended. Eventually, even after many years,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ambisonance may resolve to consonance, or to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; dissonance.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ambisonance: I can identify it as a mathematical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ratio, and I can identify it as a musical interval, but I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; also know that what I am hearing I do not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; completely understand, hence the experience of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; awe.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=85861 href="#85861">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2010 6:33:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hpiinstruments&quot; &lt;aaronhunt@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Strange, new, unknown sound: Xensonority<br/>&gt; Ambiguous, uncategorized sound: Ambisonority<br/>&gt; Named, known, categorized sound: Gnostisonority... or Xerosonority?</p><p>That strange, squealing/shrieking sound made by university age girls all living under one roof: Sororitysonority.</p><p>Ok, I&apos;ll return to lurk mode now... :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=85865 href="#85865">ðŸ”—</a>hpiinstruments &#x3C;aaronhunt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2010 7:23:15 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>tee-hee!</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hpiinstruments&quot; &lt;aaronhunt@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Strange, new, unknown sound: Xensonority<br/>&gt; &gt; Ambiguous, uncategorized sound: Ambisonority<br/>&gt; &gt; Named, known, categorized sound: Gnostisonority... or Xerosonority?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That strange, squealing/shrieking sound made by university age girls all living under one roof: Sororitysonority.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, I&apos;ll return to lurk mode now... :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;</p></div>
