And, for those of us who do all our tuning work by ear<br/>with zero aid from electronics, cents are (again) absolutely<br/>worthless.

It seems to me that if it is still<br/>possible for 45/32 to sound spookily-dead-on, it must be possible for<br/>20/13, tuned very precisely, to have the same effect. Moreover if<br/>45/32 can somehow manage to be beatless, a pure 9/7 ought to be able<br/>to also. A meantone with a fifth of the size exactly (224/9)^(1/8)<br/>will have two interesting properties; first it will have supermajor<br/>triads which are spookily dead on, and second it will have nearly<br/>synchronized beating for a major triad in root position in case that<br/>makes a difference to how you hear it.

Taken by itself, it&apos;s more a 15/13 or even, if<br/>you believe in the 19-limit, a 22/19.

Logarithmic base can be assigned any way one<br/>chooses.  The one I like best gives 720 pieces to the Pythagorean<br/>comma, and therefore 660 pieces to the syntonic comma, 60 to the<br/>schisma, and 1260 to the lesser diesis.  Then, all these can be<br/>portioned up nicely into the most commonly used amounts, all with<br/>integer arithmetic.  Much of the tuning math is reduced to very easy<br/>paperwork.

The cents system<br/>assigns its nice even 100s to an interval that is itself irrational.<br/>What a silly place to put a baseline: on an irrational interval!  I<br/>suggest that the baselines should be the JI ones of 3/2, 4/3, 5/4,<br/>6/5, maybe also 7/6, and then measure deviations from those<br/>blissfully<br/>easy and consonant points.  We can still measure the *deviations* in<br/>whatever units we want (I like fractions or percentages of commas),<br/>but the baseline points are easy places that make acoustical sense.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And, playing in 1/3 syntonic comma (aka 19edo, give or take a<br/>&gt; &gt; smidge), our diminished triads and diminished-seventh chords are<br/>all<br/>&gt; &gt; dead-on, because all the component minor thirds are pure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not really, because stacking four 6/5s is not a reasonable way to<br/>make<br/>&gt; a diminished 7th chord.

Check out Edward Parmentier&apos;s<br/>&quot;17th Century French Harpsichord Music&quot; CD (Wildboar 8502) which is<br/>*mostly* French, and is done throughout in 1/3 syntonic comma<br/>(19edo).<br/> Soon into the first track, a toccata by Froberger, he lands on a<br/>pure<br/>diminished 7th chord and it really jumps out.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=55862 href="#55862">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2004 5:01:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brad Lehman&quot; &lt;bpl@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Logarithms are useful; there&apos;s not much point claiming otherwise.</p><p>&gt; Of course they are.

The one I like best gives 720 pieces to the Pythagorean<br/>&gt; comma, and therefore 660 pieces to the syntonic comma, 60 to the<br/>&gt; schisma, and 1260 to the lesser diesis.</p><p>This leads to a set of linear equations which has a one-parameter<br/>family of solutions; the one making the most sense being 36828 equal.<br/>I&apos;m not clear why you chose this, if in fact you did, but it does have<br/>the following property--it is divisible among other things by 12, 22,<br/>27, 31, and 99, and in fact is the least common multiple of these, and<br/>so those divisions are all expressible in terms of integers. By other<br/>measures it is an undistinguished division, and is consistent only to<br/>the 9-limit.</p><p> Then, all these can be<br/>&gt; portioned up nicely into the most commonly used amounts, all with<br/>&gt; integer arithmetic.  Much of the tuning math is reduced to very easy<br/>&gt; paperwork.  Compared with this, the &quot;cents&quot; system is far too coarse<br/>&gt; and its resulting numbers look almost randomly organized.</p><p>If we ignore the business about divisors we can certainly do much<br/>better than 36828, but perhaps that is a key issue for you. What would<br/>you regard as the salient virtues of a musical logarithm system?</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It makes very little sense to me, theoretically, to pick a system<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; based on irrational numbers (i.e. the spacing of notes in 12edo)<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; use that as a standard of measurement against which everything<br/>&gt; else<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is measured, by deviation!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (81/80)^(1/4) is just as irrational as 2^(1/12). I could demonstrate<br/>&gt; &gt; how to use Kirnberger atoms to do everything using 5-limit rational<br/>&gt; &gt; numbers, but what would be the point?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I fear you&apos;ve unfortunately missed the main part of the point I was<br/>&gt; trying to make; I&apos;ll try to say it again better.  The cents system<br/>&gt; assigns its nice even 100s to an interval that is itself irrational.<br/>&gt; What a silly place to put a baseline: on an irrational interval!</p><p>2, clearly a rational number, is set to 1200 cents.</p><p> I<br/>&gt; suggest that the baselines should be the JI ones of 3/2, 4/3, 5/4,<br/>&gt; 6/5, maybe also 7/6, and then measure deviations from those<br/>&gt; blissfully<br/>&gt; easy and consonant points.</p><p>If any of these is set exactly to an integer an octave will not be an<br/>integer. However, if 3/2, 4/3, 5/4, 6/5 and 7/6 are all approximately<br/>integers, then we are in the 7-limit, since any 7-limit interval can<br/>be expressed as a product of intervals in the above set. Hence, what<br/>we would want to do is to find good 7-limit micro equal temperaments.<br/>We might, for instance, pick on 18355, 84814 or Paul Erlich&apos;s 103169;<br/>if we want divisibility by 12 there is 11664, 21480 or 33144.</p><p>&gt; A diminished-seventh chord is built of THREE stacked 6/5s, not four.<br/>&gt; G#-B-D-F...that&apos;s three intervals.</p><p>That&apos;s my point; then you get F-G#, which is something else. You can<br/>call it an augmented second if you like, but what it actually sounds<br/>like is dependent on tuning.</p></div><h3><a id=55864 href="#55864">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2004 5:33:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Brad Lehman&quot; &lt;bpl@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; There are much better arbitrary assignments available, to make<br/>better<br/>&gt; &gt; use of logarithms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree; for years for my own use I divided the octave into 612<br/>parts,<br/>&gt; which allowed me to get good accuracy while rounding off to the<br/>&gt; nearest integer.

Ever since I learned them from him seven years ago,<br/>they&apos;ve been adequate for all my practical and theoretical needs.  I<br/>feel they&apos;re a brilliantly clear way of thinking about the issues<br/>relevant to historical temperaments.</p><p>&gt; but if you&apos;re going to go all the way to ~36829, why not<br/>&gt; just go all the way to the finest MIDI tuning resolution?<br/>&gt; 196608-edo.</p><p>Because I care almost zero about MIDI.</p><p>It matters not how many ~36828.6282 equal sections the Temperaments<br/>Units scheme divides the octave.  Division of the octave is<br/>irrelevant, for historical tuning issues (except that 19edo, 31edo,<br/>and 55edo are convenient ways to round off regular comma-fraction<br/>systems, and some of the 17th and 18th century theorists did so as<br/>their own shortcuts to explain tuning to common musicians).</p><p>Instead of logarithms base 2, which (if we stick with integers) locks<br/>us into N-edo systems, it&apos;s logarithms base PythagoreanComma, to 720<br/>units.  If a given pitch is 360TU away from making a pure JI interval<br/>with some other pitch, I can see immediately that it&apos;s 1/2<br/>Pythagorean comma out.  If another pitch is 165TU away from making<br/>another JI interval, it&apos;s immediately obvious that this is 1/4<br/>syntonic comma because a syntonic comma is 660TU.  Since almost<br/>everything in the literature deals with commas whacked into 2, 3, 4,<br/>5, 6, or 12 pieces, it&apos;s nice to have integers for both commas that<br/>are easily divisible by all those divisors, yielding other integers.</p><p>That is, Brombaugh&apos;s &quot;Temperament Units&quot; system offers Diophantine<br/>clarity.  It&apos;s quite a bit easier to keep track of the lesser diesis<br/>at 1260TU (two syntonic commas less a schisma) than to tote a bunch<br/>of fractions around; or worse, micro-portions of cents.

In an atomic system, the Pythagorean comma is<br/>12 schismas, 81/80 is 11 schismas, and 12-equal is one schisma shy of<br/>a pure fifth. Dividing the Pythagorean comma into 720 parts and the<br/>Ddidymus comma into 660 parts seems to be done with an eye to getting<br/>a lot of useful divisors (of 720 and 660.) You could do something<br/>similar, only with a good deal more tuning accuracy, by dividing the<br/>Pythagorean comma into 576 parts and the Didymus comma into 528 parts.<br/>In any case it seems perverse to ignore the fact that the natural<br/>interpretation of all of this is that 5/4 gets 11856 parts, 3/2 gets<br/>21543 parts, and the octave 36828 parts. If you are tempering a fifth,<br/>you should know how big a fifth is. If you are tempering to<br/>approximate 5/4, you should know how big 5/4 is.

We are usually talking about intervals in the abstract.<br/>i.e. interval _classes_, not _particular_ pairs of pitches.
