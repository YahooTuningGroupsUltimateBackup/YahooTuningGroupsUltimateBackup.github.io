No you Can&apos;t!</p><p>As the author of the estimable &quot;SCALA for Dummies&quot; guide, I feel<br/>eminently (Eminem) (enim-- don&apos;t go there) suited to take this on...</p><p>MIDI and recorded sound have *absolutely nothing* to do with one<br/>another, or at least &quot;next to nothing...&quot;</p><p>MIDI is a set of *instructions* that makes your synth play certain<br/>notes.  One can&apos;t convert sound, of any kind, into MIDI...</p><p>On the other hand, one *can* make a sound file from a MIDI file, but<br/>it&apos;s not by *conversion!*</p><p>One must RECORD the OUTPUT of the synthesizer that is *performing*<br/>the MIDI file, or playing by those electrical instructions.  Then you<br/>can make a .wav file, a .mp3 file by *recording* and from the .wav<br/>file, cut a CD, if you like!</p><p>Makes sense??  Maybe this is a MakeMicroMusic topic...</p><p>J.
