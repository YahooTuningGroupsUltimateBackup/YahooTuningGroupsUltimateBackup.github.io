The<br/>problem which I am having is that while my teacher is an outstanding<br/>artist, his command of my language is sub-average, and I therefore<br/>would like to get in contact with English (or German) speaking ney<br/>players who also have knowledge about construction details of the<br/>flute itself. Which then of course extends into knowledge about the<br/>scale and notation peculiarities. The webpages of the Turkish builders<br/>like Mehmet &Uuml;cel give you a lot of music, but no theory or<br/>construction details. Scanning this group for &quot;ney&quot; did not give me a<br/>lead other than to Ozan&apos;s nephew, the rest was words that ended with<br/>-ney. While of course I will try to get in contact with DervD1s Can<br/>Vural, I was wondering whether there is anybody else on this list who<br/>is both a tuning expert (that is presupposed) and a ney player as<br/>well. Probably an offlist reply is best. Thank you,<br/>Michael</p></div>
