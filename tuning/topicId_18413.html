Erlich &lt;<a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a>&gt; wrote in Tuning Digest<br/>1093, quoting my comments on 19-note meantone keyboards in a dialogue<br/>with Graham Breed:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Costeley (1570) describes a similar 19-note keyboard for 19-tET,<br/>&gt;&gt; and 19-note keyboards or _cembali chromatici_ (&quot;chromatic<br/>&gt;&gt; harpsichords) had some vogue in Naples around 1600, the environment<br/>&gt;&gt; of the famed composer Gesualdo, where keyboard composers such as<br/>&gt;&gt; Trabaci wrote pieces especially for this instrument.</p><p>&gt; Are you saying Trabaci wrote specifically for 19-tET? Any other composers,<br/>&gt; with dates, that we might add to Joe Monzo&apos;s list in his dictionary entry<br/>&gt; for &quot;Equal Temperament&quot;?</p><p>Here the answer is &quot;No,&quot; although a reader could easily draw such a<br/>conclusion from my failure to distinguish the general theme of 19-note<br/>keyboards from the more specific theme of 19-tET as advocated by<br/>Costeley.</p><p>The 19-note _cembalo chromatico_ was tuned very likely to 1/4-comma<br/>meantone (pure major thirds) or something similar; Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma<br/>tuning with major and minor thirds equally tempered by 1/7 comma, for<br/>example, could have been an alternative. It thus presented an _open_<br/>19-note tuning (typically Gb-B#).</p><p>There are some revealing pieces of evidence confirming this<br/>interpretation. First, Trabaci wrote a piece with a sonority of<br/>D#-F##-A#, calling for a major third above D#, and going one fifth in<br/>the sharp direction beyond the usual 19-note Gb-B# range. He advises<br/>that this sonority may be played D#-F#-A# (with a minor third) on a<br/>usual _cembalo chromatico_. This suggests that the piece may have<br/>written especially for an _archicembalo_ or similar instrument with a<br/>full 1/4-comma meantone cycle of 31 notes a la Vicentino (1555) and<br/>Colonna (1618), with one such instrument (designed a bit differently<br/>from the instruments of either of these authors) coming down to us<br/>from around 1606.</p><p>Also, Colonna says that the first 19 notes of his 31-note _Sambuca<br/>Lincea_ are tuned as on the &quot;chromatic harpsichords&quot; -- well-known in<br/>Naples. Since his system (like Vicentino&apos;s) is based on a 31-note<br/>cycle dividing the whole-tone into five parts, this points to<br/>1/4-comma meantone as a likely solution -- or as described in later<br/>17th-century theory, 31-tET (Rossi, Huygens).</p><p>Possibly one of the reasons I may not have made a due distinction<br/>between 19-note keyboards and specifically 19-tET ones is that Graham<br/>and I were mostly discussing 19-note meantones in the vicinity of<br/>1/4-comma or 31-tET, so that the Costelely 19-tET application was a<br/>sort of digression; but that is much clearer once stated!</p><p>Thank for your question, which gives an opportunity to suggest that<br/>Trabaci might be placed under &quot;likely 1/4-comma meantone with 19 or<br/>more notes,&quot; also very close to &quot;19-or-more-out-of-31-tET.&quot;</p><p>&gt;&gt; In contrast, a minor seventh at or near 9:5 (e.g. a Pythagorean<br/>&gt;&gt; augmented sixth, to continue our &quot;role reversal&quot; theme) seems to me<br/>&gt;&gt; often more tense than either a 16:9 or a 7:4, although the<br/>&gt;&gt; 1020-cent interval of 20-tET is quite fine,</p><p>&gt; 1020 cents is only 2 cents off 9:5 -- certainly &quot;near&quot;, wouldn&apos;t you<br/>&gt; say?</p><p>Yes, and my intended interpretation was, &quot;When I compare the tunings<br/>of the minor seventh, I tend to find 9:5 more tense, but interestingly<br/>I find the very close approximation in 20-tET not especially tense in<br/>practice.&quot; Curiously, 1020 cents is also almost exactly the size of<br/>the Pythagorean augmented sixth (e.g. Eb-C#) or _pentatonus_ of<br/>Jacobus of Liege (five 9:8 whole-tones of ~204 cents each,<br/>59049:32768) -- a ~1.95-cent schisma wider than 9:5.</p><p>As long as we&apos;re discussing this point, an interesting thing about<br/>20-tET is that neo-Gothic minor seventh sonorities combining this<br/>interval with a minor third and a fifth have alternative forms such as<br/>0-720-960 cents (upper interval of 240 cents) or 0-720-1020 cents<br/>(upper interval of 300 cents). The upper interval in either case<br/>typically contracts to a unison, acting in a minor-third-like way,<br/>with the outer minor seventh contracting to a fifth.</p><p>Anyway, in generalizing that 16:9 or 7:4 seems to me maybe a bit<br/>milder than 9:5, I wanted to cite 20-tET as an example to qualify this<br/>generalization; also, in Renaissance/Manneristic meantone, I find the<br/>minor sevenths quite fine (midway between 16:9 and 9:5), and suspect<br/>that a pure 9:5 might be similarly quite in keeping with the style.</p><p>Any of these sizes seems to me a variation in &quot;modal color&quot; or the<br/>like on the basic theme of a minor seventh, and I would add that a<br/>neat feature of 20-tET is the way it provides different sizes of<br/>ordinary intervals in a usual neo-Gothic arrangement -- unlike 22-tET<br/>for neo-Gothic, &quot;usual&quot; is here a bit different from &quot;regular,&quot; as I<br/>hope to discuss soon in an article on this tuning.</p><p>Maybe 20-tET to neo-Gothic is like 22-tET to Classic diatonic/triadic;<br/>there are all kinds of incredible possibilities, but not exactly the<br/>accustomed ones.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
