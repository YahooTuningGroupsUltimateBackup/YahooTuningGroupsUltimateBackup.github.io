Thank you very much for<br/>educating me on this point.</p><p>In fact Joseph Yasser uses both analogies we&apos;re discussing in the<br/>third part of his article on &quot;Medieval Quartal Harmony&quot; in the<br/>_Musical Quarterly_ (v. 24, 1938, pp. 351-385). While I have lots of<br/>differences with many of Yasser&apos;s specific conclusions about medieval<br/>polyphonic style, nevertheless his presentation of medieval<br/>verticality as an independent system in its own right has had immense<br/>influence on me.</p><p>Anyway, in proposing a system for Gregorian chant harmonization based<br/>mainly on the fourth as a primary consonance, Yasser notes that one<br/>may sometimes conclude on a sonority with a fifth above the lowest<br/>tone for a more &quot;resonant&quot; ending -- as opposed to an &quot;irresonant&quot;<br/>ending on a fourth.</p><p>He refers to this liberty in his system as a _Quint de Picardie_ --<br/>explicity drawing a parallel with the tertian _Tierce de Picardie_, a<br/>term adopted at some point for the very widespread 16th-century and<br/>later practice of preferring that thirds in cadential sonorities of<br/>arrival be major. Thus he contrasts the &quot;resonant&quot; 3-limit fifth and<br/>5-limit major third with the &quot;irresonant&quot; 3-limit fourth and 5-limit<br/>minor third.</p><p>Elsewhere, Yasser also expressly treats the fourth and fifth as<br/>inversions comparable to thirds and sixths in tertian harmony.<br/>Curiously, he regards the fourth as the primary form and the fifth as<br/>the &quot;inversion&quot; -- possibly a tenable concept in styles like that of<br/>Guido d&apos;Arezzo in the early 11th century where the fourth is preferred<br/>to the fifth as a basic consonance. He thus describes parallel fifths<br/>in some medieval contexts as &quot;inverted&quot; sonorities comparable to the<br/>parallel sixths of early 15th-century _fauxbourdon_ (the latter being<br/>favored by Dufay and Binchois, for example, in what I would call the<br/>transition era from medieval to Renaissance style and also from<br/>3-limit to 5-limit).</p><p>Anyway, thanks both for alerting me to an important point about<br/>Partch&apos;s outlook, and for giving me an opportunity to mention<br/>Yasser. Reading him again, I see that he argues that a fourth above<br/>the bass may be in tension with both the third partial (at the twelfh)<br/>and the fifth partial (at the major 17th).</p><p>Your points about comparisons between 5-limit sonorities also call for<br/>lots of discussion, but I wonder if maybe first I should write a piece<br/>on Zarlino&apos;s analysis of these sonorities which I&apos;m planning. Trying<br/>to frame an immediate response on this point, I found myself raising<br/>issues which maybe would be clearer against the background of such an<br/>article.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
