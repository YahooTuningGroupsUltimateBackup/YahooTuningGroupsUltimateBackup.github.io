Although Mr. Regener<br/>hopes that his formalism will lead toward the development of a<br/>system for the objective analysis of music, the more immediate<br/>goal of establishing a mathematical model useful for expressing<br/>any notated interval in relation to its associated sound (given<br/>in terms of the frequency ratio between the two pitches forming<br/>the interval) better represents the nature and value of this study.</p><p>In the mathematical approach live both the main advantages and<br/>primary disadvantages of the book.  On the one hand, the formalism<br/>ensures a logical, systematic, and generalized description of pitch<br/>notation and of particular intonation systems.  On the other hand,<br/>facility in reading a book of this sort depends to a great degree<br/>on one&apos;s facility in reading mathematical notation and in grasping<br/>the necessary mathematical concepts, even though every concept is<br/>defined and important ideas illustrated by examples, tables, and<br/>graphs.  For a mathematician, the mathematics would be elementary<br/>and probably uninteresting.  For a musician interested in Mr.<br/>Regener&apos;s ideas on notation theory, the mathematics might seem<br/>overly complicated, actually detracting from the understanding<br/>of the material.</p><p>Following introductory comments, certain mathematical background,<br/>and a discussion of the author&apos;s long-range purposes for the book<br/>(to be discussed below), the main body of the formalism begins in<br/>Chapter 6, entitled &quot;Notated Pitches&quot;.  Here Regener establishes<br/>a means for representing any notated pitch, apart from its rhythmic<br/>value, in terms of two numbers.  The first number, called the<br/>&quot;diatone&quot; of a note, corresponds to the staff position of the note,<br/>specifically its distance in diatonic steps from a reference pitch:<br/>the F below middle C.  Letting the diatone of this reference<br/>pitch &quot;F_0&quot; be equal to 0, the diatone of G_0 (or Gb, G#, Gbb,<br/>G##, etc. in the same register) a step above F_0 equals 1; A_0<br/>two steps up equals 2; B_0 equals 3, and so on.  Below F_0, the<br/>same principle applies, thought the numbers are negative: the<br/>diatone, for example, of E_-1 a step below equals -1; D_-1 two<br/>steps below equals -2.  The subscript for each letter refers to<br/>the note&apos;s register in relation to F_0.</p><p>The second number identifying a pitch, called the &quot;quint&quot; of a<br/>note, measures the distance from F (again equal to 0) in a sequency<br/>of perfect fifths that Regener refers to as the &quot;quint group&quot;:</p><p>... Ebb Bbb Fb Cb Gb Db Ab Eb Bb F C G D A E B F# C# G# D# A# E# ...<br/>...  -9 -8  -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  8  9  10 11 12 ...</p><p>For a given pitch, the quint thus fills in the information lacking<br/>from the diatone, that is, the accidental given to a particular<br/>letter-name: for example, here a pitch with a number between 0 and<br/>6 has no accidental, those with numbers between 7 and 13 have one<br/>sharp, those with numbers between -7 and 1 have one flat.</p><p>Defined as the &quot;notated pitch&quot; of a note, the two numbers form a<br/>pair (d,q) where &quot;d&quot; equals the diatone of the note and &quot;q&quot; equals<br/>its quint. *1  The &quot;notated pitch&quot; of middle C would be read as<br/>(4,1): the C without an accidental that is 4 steps above F_0.  The<br/>C# a chromatic semitone above middle C is represented as (4,8):<br/>the C whose staff position lies four steps (diatones) above F_0<br/>but whose form with one sharp is a distance of 8 away from F in<br/>the quint group.  The note Cb in the same register has as its<br/>identification number (4,-6); the Cb an octave higher would be<br/>(11,-6). *2</p><p>The pair (d,q) thus uniquely defines every possible notated pitch<br/>(even such unlikely notes as Abbb or F###, since the diatone and<br/>quint series can be extended infinitely).  Regener then shows how<br/>these notated pitches can be plotted on a graph, with the horizontal<br/>axis corresponding to the quint group and the vertical axis<br/>representing the diatonic distances.  (Example 1 - taken from<br/>Fig. 3, p. 41, in the book - shows the notated pitches about the<br/>two axes and on an enlarged treble and bass staff.)  The point of<br/>origin of the two axes if F_0, with coordinates (0,0).  Any note<br/>with coordinates (d,q) has its own point on the graph, such as<br/>Ab_0 = (2, -3) which lies up 2 from F_0 on the vertical (diatone)<br/>axis and -3 (3 points to the left from F_0) on the horizontal<br/>(quint) axis.</p><p>[NOTE FROM MONZO: I have only reproduced part of this diagram in<br/>ASCII format; it is greatly reduced and omits the clefs, but does<br/>at  least show the single-flats and the naturals for the octave<br/>above and below the central F_0.]</p><p>[Chrisman&apos;s &quot;Example 1&quot;]</p><p>----- Fb_1 -------------------- F_1 --------------------- F#_1  7<br/>Ebb_0   |                  Eb_0  |                    E_0  |    6<br/>        |         Db_0           |            D_0          |    5<br/>        |  Cb_0                  |    C_0                  |    4<br/>   Bbb_0|                    Bb_0|                      B_0|    3<br/>        |            Ab_0        |               A_0       |    2<br/>        |     Gb_0               |        G_0              |    1<br/>      Fb_0 -------------------- F_0 --------------------- F#_0  0<br/>Ebb_-1  |                  Eb_-1 |                   E_-1  |   -1<br/>        |         Db_-1          |            D_-1         |   -2<br/>        |  Cb_-1                 |    C_-1                 |   -3<br/>  Bbb_-1|                   Bb_-1|                     B_-1|   -4<br/>        |            Ab_-1       |               A_-1      |   -5<br/>        |     Gb_-1              |        G_-1             |   -6<br/> ---- Fb_-1 ------------------- F_-1 ------------------- F#_-1 -7</p><p>-9  -8  -7  -6  -5 -4  -3  -2  -1  0  1   2   3   4   5  6  7</p><p>Vertical axis: diatone _d_, horizontal axis: quint _q_.<br/>Subscript: register-number as defined.</p><p>Each notated pitch, therefore, is actually represented as an<br/>interval from the basepoint F_0, since both the diatone and the<br/>quint define each point in terms of distances from F_0 = (0,0). *3<br/>This set of points, or intervals, and the particular rules for<br/>associating form what Regener calls an &quot;interval space&quot;,<br/>which he<br/>labels _I_ [NOTE FROM MONZO: This appears in Chrisman&apos;s text as a<br/>capital I with a wavy line under it.] (the wavy underscore<br/>symbolizing boldface type; I&apos;ll just refer to this as<br/>&quot;I&quot;).<br/>The chapter on interval space, Chapter 8, is the most important<br/>of the entire book, as everything from that point on depends on<br/>concepts and mathematical expressions defined here.  Unfortunately,<br/>I also found this chapter the most difficult to understand.  For<br/>these reasons, I will go into more detail, while trying to simplify<br/>and to clarify the essential ideas presented.</p><p>In Chapter 8, Regener establishes the means by which every notated<br/>pitch with coordinates (d,q) in the interval space &quot;I&quot; can be<br/>reinterpreted as a point with new coordinates (a,b) in relation to<br/>a new set of vertical and horizontal axes, thus forming another<br/>interval space.  Regener shows how one of these new interval spaces<br/>can be generated by two intervals that act as the &quot;minimal<br/>basis&quot;<br/>of that space, just as a diatone and a quint act as basic units of<br/>measure and of vertical and horizontal direction  &quot;unit<br/>vectors&quot; <br/>in &quot;I&quot;.  Regener uses the intervals (3,-1) (the upward perfect<br/>fourth  F_0 to Bb_0) and (1,2) (the upward major second <br/>F_0 to<br/>G_0) to illustrate one possible interval space which he calls<br/>&quot;K_0&quot;.<br/>*4</p><p>The creation of &quot;K_0&quot; from the original space &quot;I&quot; can<br/>be visualized<br/>by representing with solid lines the two generating intervals (3,-1)<br/>and (1,2).  (See Example 2a, which is simply a portion of the figure<br/>from Example 1.)</p><p>[Chrisman&apos;s &quot;Example 2a&quot;; the reader must bear with the<br/>limitations<br/>of ASCII and imagine that the two diagonal lines are dotted lines<br/>and the tilted rectangle in the center has heavy solid lines on<br/>the left and bottom edges, and light solid lines on the right and<br/>top edges.]</p><p>             d<br/>             |<br/>   &grave;         |5<br/>    &grave;        |<br/>     &grave;      _|4&apos;&grave; C_0 (4,1)<br/>      &grave; _.-&grave; |   &grave;<br/>   Bb_0\     |3   &grave;<br/>  (3,-1)\    |     &grave;             ,<br/>         \   |2     &grave;        ,<br/>          \  |       &grave;   ,<br/>           \ |1    _.-&grave; G_0 (1,2)<br/>  F_0 (0,0) \| _.-&grave;<br/>  -----------\-------------------- q<br/>  -2   -1 , 0|&grave;   1   2   3   4<br/>      ,    -1| &grave;<br/>  ,          |  &grave;<br/>           -2|   &grave;<br/>             |    &grave;<br/>           -3|     &grave;</p><p>When extended in either direction these lines form the new axes<br/>(dotted lines in Ex 2a) of the interval space &quot;K_0&quot;.  Each of<br/>the<br/>two generating intervals also defines the unit of distance of each<br/>point along its respective axis, whereas in &quot;I&quot; a unit of<br/>distance<br/>measured one diatone away from F_0 and one quint away from F_0.<br/>In the new space, therefore, with F_0 again being the point of<br/>origin (0,0), the Bb and the G each represent point &quot;1&quot; along<br/>its<br/>respective axis; point &quot;2&quot; would then be Eb along the F-Bb<br/>axis<br/>and A along the F-G axis.  Thus the transformation from one space<br/>to another, though using the same points, effects a change in<br/>coordinates from (d,q) in &quot;I&quot; to (a,b) in &quot;K_0&quot;.<br/>Example 2b<br/>illustrates this and also shows how all the points from &quot;I&quot;<br/>can<br/>be realigned by placing the new axes vertically and horizontally<br/>and by equalizing the distances between  the point along each axis.<br/>Under realignment the parallelogram that connects four points in<br/>&quot;I&quot; (drawn in Ex. 2a) becomes a square in &quot;K_0&quot; (Ex.<br/>2b) yet still<br/>connects the same four points.  Like a huge lattice, all the points<br/>in the old space are similarly affected.</p><p>[Chrisman&apos;s &quot;Example 2b&quot;; here, I use &grave;x&apos; to<br/>represent the heavy<br/>solid line.]</p><p>              a<br/>              |<br/>              |2<br/>              |<br/>              |<br/>    Bb_0 (1,0)x1 . . .C_0 (1,1)<br/>              x      .<br/>              x      .<br/>     F_0 (0,0)x      .G_0 (0,1)<br/>--------------xxxxxxxx----------- b<br/>-2     -1     |0     1      2<br/>              |<br/>              |-1<br/>              |<br/>              |<br/>              |-2<br/>              |</p><p>For any two intervals that generate a new interval space from<br/>&quot;I&quot;,<br/>the following transformation equations relate the coordinates of<br/>a point (d,q) in &quot;I&quot;, whose unit vectors are (1,0) and (0,1),<br/>with the new coordinates (a,b) in the generated space, whose<br/>intervals i and j  the new unit vectors  serve as a minimal<br/>basis for the new space:</p><p>     d(1,0) + q(0,1) = ai + bj</p><p>In other words, the coordinates times the unit vectors in the old<br/>space equals the new coordinates times the new unit vectors.</p><p>Interval space &quot;K_0&quot; was used only to illustrate the<br/>transformation<br/>from &quot;I&quot; to some other space.  Regener now constructs another<br/>space &quot;K_1&quot; based on the intervals (7,0) (the upward perfect<br/>8ve)<br/>and (4,1) (the upward perfect fifth), an interval space much more<br/>useful and historically consistent in terms of intonation theory,<br/>and one which also simplifies the mathematics. *5  The<br/>transformation equations between coordinates in the two spaces<br/>now become:</p><p>     d(1,0) + q(0,1) = a(7,0) + b(4,1)   or<br/>               (d,q) = (7a+4b,b)      and<br/>                   d = 7a + 4b<br/>                   q = b</p><p>Solving for a and b (Equation 8.21, p. 82):</p><p>   a = (d  4q)/7     (= k_0)<br/>   b = q              (= q_0)</p><p>[NOTE FROM MONZO: this equation contained an error which was<br/>corrected in the following issue of the Journal.]</p><p>In this new space &quot;K_1&quot;, when the axes are realigned (as was<br/>&quot;K_0&quot;<br/>in Ex.2b), each successive point (a) along the vertical axis now<br/>corresponds to an interval of an octave, while each successive<br/>point (b) along the horizontal axis still represents the quint.<br/>For an interval in &quot;K_1&quot; between two notated pitches (each<br/>with<br/>its own two coordinates), Regener therefore calls the distance<br/>between the two respective points along the vertical axis the<br/>&quot;octave-span&quot; of the interval (cf. &quot;diatonic-span&quot;,<br/>reference 3),<br/>thus generalizing coordinate &quot;a&quot; above; he renames this<br/>&quot;k_0&quot;.<br/>Similarly, the distance in quints between the respective &quot;b&quot;<br/>coordinates of the two notes forming the interval is called<br/>(as in &quot;I&quot;) the &quot;quint-span&quot;, labeled &quot;q_0&quot;.</p><p>Regener is now able to define a correspondence between notation<br/>and sound  i.e., between any notated interval and a particular<br/>frequency-ratio.  Specifically, he is most concerned with what<br/>he defines as &quot;regular intonation systems&quot;, symbolized by the<br/>function lf (log frequency-ratio), for which two conditions must<br/>be satisfied: the perfect octave (7,0) is defined to have a<br/>frequency ratio of 2:1; and the frequency ratio of two notated<br/>intervals combined equals the product of their two individual<br/>frequency ratios.  This second condition implies that exactly<br/>one frequency ratio will always correspond to any given interval<br/>of the same name, thus ensuring that intonation is always<br/>consistent with the notation.  (It is possible, of course, that<br/>more than one interval will have the same frequency ratio, as<br/>in twelve-tone equal temperament.)</p><p>Regener then proves that in a regular intonation system all the<br/>frequency ratios will be completely determined by assigning a<br/>particular frequency ratio to just one notated interval other<br/>than the perfect prime or its octave equivalents.  It is here<br/>(pp. 89-94) that the final link between notated pitches and<br/>frequency ratios is made: the log frequency-ratio of any interval<br/>i = (d,q) can be given in terms of the transformation coordinates<br/>(k_0,q_0), which as shown above can be derived from (d,q), and in<br/>terms of the log frequency-ratio of the perfect fifth. *6  The log<br/>frequency-ratio of the perfect fifth thus acts as the &quot;determining<br/>constant&quot; for the entire regular intonation system: its value<br/>determines the value of every other interval (except the perfect<br/>octave, which is already defined).</p><p>With the essential relationships between notation and frequency<br/>ratios established, the second half of the book deals with<br/>applications of the now generalized description.  First Regener<br/>distinguishes between &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; regular<br/>intonation<br/>systems, borrowing Murray Barbour&apos;s term &quot;closed&quot; in the<br/>sense<br/>of a &quot;regular temperament in which the initial note is eventually<br/>reached again&quot;, as in equal temperament *7; by analogy its<br/>counterpart is called an &quot;open&quot; system, as in Pythagorean<br/>tuning.<br/>Although Regener briefly discusses open systems, he is mainly<br/>concerned with closed regular systems, for which he proves that<br/>a system is closed if and only if it has a &quot;non-trivial&quot;<br/>enharmonic<br/>interval: an interval (from F_0) other than the perfect prime,<br/>whose frequency-ratio is 1:1  an interval that closes the system<br/>in the sense of which Barbour speaks.  Mathematically, an<br/>intonation system containing enharmonic intervals results in a<br/>simplified form of the determining constant, one equal to k_0/q_0<br/>(from the transformation coordinates) where q_0 corresponds to the<br/>number of tones which divide the octave and where k_0 gives the<br/>number of tones comprised by the perfect fifth in the system.<br/>In twelve-tone equal temperament, for example, the determining<br/>constant would be 7/12: twelve divisions to the octave with the<br/>perfect fifth equal to seven of those divisions.  It is at this<br/>point that the mathematical approach really proves worthwhile,<br/>resulting in a very simple, useful, and descriptive relationship.</p><p>Regener compares regular systems with &quot;just&quot; intonation <br/>systems whose frequency ratios are rational numbers, i.e.,<br/>expressible as a quotient of integers (p. 117).  Here he also<br/>presents criteria for &quot;preferred&quot; frequency ratios, criteria<br/>which historically have sometimes governed decisions of choosing<br/>certain frequency ratios over others. *8  When correlated with<br/>criteria for notationally consistent closed regular systems,<br/>these criteria for preferred ratios result in a number of systems<br/>whose determining constant lie within the range 11/19 (nineteen<br/>divisions of the octave) and 7/12.  In these later chapters<br/>familiar items keep emerging, though approached from a new<br/>perspective.</p><p>Following a chapter that relates the conclusions reached thus far<br/>to a generalization of pitch notation, Regener returns to his hope<br/>that his system for representing notated pitches and intervals can<br/>be used as a means for analyzing tonal music in a completely<br/>objective manner.  Considering a musical score as a &quot;more<br/>reliable&quot;<br/>representation of the music than any performance of that music<br/>(a case could be made, I think, that supports the opposite<br/>viewpoint), he speculates that it might be possible to find and<br/>to codify the &quot;internal syntactic arrangement of the score&quot; by<br/>treating it as a &quot;detached, abstract symbolic entity, irrespective<br/>of its possible realizations in sound and their conceivable effects<br/>on potential auditors&quot; (pp. 2-3). *9  I sense that underlying<br/>Regener&apos;s thinking is the notion that for tonal music there is<br/>some &quot;natural law&quot; that governs the patterns of symbols in a<br/>musical score, irrespective of composer or of the evolution<br/>of the composer&apos;s style.  Although I am skeptical of such an<br/>assumption, especially when one is concerned with the leading<br/>tonal composers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, I<br/>am curious about what it might lead to, more in terms of process<br/>rather than of end results.

Unfortunately, the formal approach might discourage<br/>interested readers from proceeding beyond the second chapter,<br/>which is why I tried to &quot;translate&quot; some of the problematic<br/>areas.<br/>Unquestionably, mathematics and mathematical notation are useful<br/>and often necessary, to a certain degree, for music theory, as in<br/>the case of this book.  But the apparatus itself can completely<br/>negate whatever ideas one hopes to convey.  I think that a<br/>preferable approach would be to present, in the final discussion,<br/>a minimum of mathematics.  If proofs are essential, these can be<br/>placed in appendices or, even more simply, can be referred to in<br/>other sources, since nearly all of the math used for music can be<br/>found in basic undergraduate texts.  A formal approach may very<br/>well lead to important conclusions, but there is usually no need<br/>to present these conclusions in a form that may limit the<br/>readership to what I suspect is a very small number.</p><p>REFERENCES</p><p>*1  Although I found that I would usually just refer to the charts<br/>of these numbers that are provided in the book (Figures 1 and 2,<br/>pp. 36-37), I also tried to find a simple way of remembering these<br/>numbers, at least within the range of 0 to 6: F always equals 0;<br/>the diatone of a note corresponds to the scale degrees in a G major<br/>scale  G=1, A=2, , E=6; the quints of notes F,G,A,B are in<br/>the<br/>even sequence 0,2,4,6 respectively and of notes C,D,E are odd,<br/>1,3,5 respectively.</p><p>*2  Both the diatone and quint numbers are set up so that notes of<br/>the same letter-name have numbers that are related by multiples of<br/>7  that is, are equivalent mod7.  In both cases if a number is<br/>greater than 6 or less than 0, the number 7 can be subtracted or<br/>added respectively one or more times until the number lies within<br/>the range of 0 to 6.  For the diatones, the numbers of times that<br/>7 is subtracted or added tells the number of octaves the note lies<br/>from the register above or below F_0, respectively.  The number of<br/>times 7 can be added to or subtracted from the quint number outside<br/>the 0 to 6 range tells the number of sharps or flats, respectively,<br/>that the letter-name carries.  These relationships essentially<br/>form the basis for the chapter on Modular Arithmetic (Chapter 5)<br/>as well as in the chapter on Notated Pitches.</p><p>*3  Intervals between other notes besides those formed with F_0<br/>can be ascertained by finding the distance between the diatones<br/>of the two notes (the &quot;diatonic span&quot;) and between the quints<br/>of<br/>the two notes (the &quot;quint-span&quot;); the resultant two numbers<br/>give<br/>the diatone and quint of the interval formed.  Interval addition<br/>works in the same way, though here the d and q coordinates of the<br/>resultant interval equals respectively the sum of the diatones and<br/>the sum of the two quints of the intervals.</p><p>*4  The conditions for two intervals being the generators of an<br/>interval space are given on pages 65 through 75.</p><p>*5  Apparently, the reason that an interval space other than<br/>&quot;K_1&quot;<br/>was used to illustrate transformations from &quot;I&quot; is because the<br/>quint axis in &quot;K_1&quot; is the same as that in &quot;I&quot;.<br/>Interval space<br/>&quot;K_0&quot; necessitated a change in both the vertical and<br/>horizontal<br/>axes and coordinates, thus representing a more general example of<br/>these transformations.</p><p>*6  As shown, any interval i = (d,q) in &quot;I&quot; can be<br/>reinterpreted<br/>in terms of coordinates (k_0, q_0) in interval space &quot;K_1&quot; as<br/>given by the transformation equation: i = k_0(7,0) + q_0(4,1).<br/>The frequency ratio of i, expressed as a logarithm to the base 2<br/>and symbolized as the log frequency-ratio lf(i), is given by the<br/>equation: lf(i) = k_0 * lf(7,0) + q_0 * lf(4,1).  Since the value<br/>of the perfect octave (7,0) was defined to be 2:1, its log<br/>frequency-ratio to the base 2 equals 1 and the equation now reads:<br/>lf(i) = k_0 + q_0 * lf(4,1).</p><p>*7  J. Murray Barbour, TUNING AND TEMPERAMENT: A HISTORICAL SURVEY,<br/>2nd ed. (East Lansing, 1953), ix.</p><p>*8  The first of these relates to &quot;consonance&quot;: that preferred<br/>frequency-ratios are &quot;those involving the lower numbers when in<br/>lowest terms&quot; (p. 127).  Second, &quot;preferred&quot;<br/>frequency-ratios<br/>are &quot;those which can be derived by linear combination from<br/>known &grave;preferred&apos; values for other intervals, beginning with<br/>the ratios 3/2 for a perfect fifth and 5/4 for a major third&quot;<br/>(pp. 127-8).</p><p>*9  I could not imagine how an analysis of the musical score<br/>could be made on the basis of pitch alone, since the rhythmic<br/>and metric context determines so many of the melodic and harmonic<br/>considerations.  Almost as though finishing an incomplete sentence,<br/>the final chapter of the book does show the necessity for relating<br/>pitch with the metric/rhythmic dimensions.</p><p>------------------------------------------</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;pehrson@pubmedia.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/24/2000 6:56:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/14995">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/14995</a></p><p>This is quite interesting, Monz, and you really do find some unusual<br/>stuff back in the stacks!</p><p>This system really seems to emphasize the &quot;quint&quot; or the perfect<br/>fifth as a prime generator of pitch, though, doesn&apos;t it??</p><p>I think I would be just as happy with the Forte/Babbitt &quot;pitch class,<br/>interval class&quot; nomenclature based on semitones...</p><p>Also, there is much toodoo about finding frequencies of pitches.<br/>That&apos;s not really &quot;rocket science&quot; is it??

Regener now constructs another<br/>&gt; space &quot;K_1&quot; based on the intervals (7,0) (the upward perfect<br/>&gt; 8ve)<br/>&gt; and (4,1) (the upward perfect fifth), an interval space much more<br/>&gt; useful and historically consistent in terms of intonation theory,<br/>&gt; and one which also simplifies the mathematics.</p><p>This illustrates in a particular case how a rank-two tone group can be<br/>converted to the period-generator basis.</p><p>&gt; Regener then proves that in a regular intonation system all the<br/>&gt; frequency ratios will be completely determined by assigning a<br/>&gt; particular frequency ratio to just one notated interval other<br/>&gt; than the perfect prime or its octave equivalents.  It is here<br/>&gt; (pp. 89-94) that the final link between notated pitches and<br/>&gt; frequency ratios is made: the log frequency-ratio of any interval<br/>&gt; i = (d,q) can be given in terms of the transformation coordinates<br/>&gt; (k_0,q_0), which as shown above can be derived from (d,q), and in<br/>&gt; terms of the log frequency-ratio of the perfect fifth. *6  The log<br/>&gt; frequency-ratio of the perfect fifth thus acts as the &quot;determining<br/>&gt; constant&quot; for the entire regular intonation system: its value<br/>&gt; determines the value of every other interval (except the perfect<br/>&gt; octave, which is already defined).</p><p>This illustrates in a special case that the tuning of a rank-two<br/>temperament with pure octaves is defined by the tuning of its generator.</p><p>&gt; Although Regener briefly discusses open systems, he is mainly<br/>&gt; concerned with closed regular systems, for which he proves that<br/>&gt; a system is closed if and only if it has a &quot;non-trivial&quot;<br/>&gt; enharmonic<br/>&gt; interval: an interval (from F_0) other than the perfect prime,<br/>&gt; whose frequency-ratio is 1:1  an interval that closes the system<br/>&gt; in the sense of which Barbour speaks.</p><p>This illustrates in a special case that if a comma is added to a<br/>rank-two temperament it becomes rank-one.</p><p>&gt; Also, I am not convinced that Regener&apos;s notational system would<br/>&gt; be necessary for an objective study, since there already exists<br/>&gt; a completely objective means for representing the musical score<br/>&gt;  the Ford-Columbia Music Representation for computer analysis.</p><p>It depends on whether the score is understandable in meantone terms or<br/>not.</p><p>&gt; I assume that Regener is also implying the application of<br/>&gt; mathematics, beyond the notation itself, which might very well<br/>&gt; prove to be important, as it has in other fields (quantum<br/>&gt; mechanics, for example).</p><p>Nothing you described is really new so far as I can see.</p><p>&gt; If proofs are essential, these can be<br/>&gt; placed in appendices or, even more simply, can be referred to in<br/>&gt; other sources, since nearly all of the math used for music can be<br/>&gt; found in basic undergraduate texts.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not always true.
