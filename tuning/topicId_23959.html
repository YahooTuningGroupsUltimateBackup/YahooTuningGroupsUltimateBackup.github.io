Ben Tells me Partch was always bitter about Nikolais. In fact, and this might be less well known, the original performance of the bewitched was possibly not going to take place because of it. In fact, as Ben Johnston tells me, the only reason it did is because Partch was, quitely, threatened with a law suit if he didn&apos;t follow through with it. He didn&apos;t like the choreography and wanted to back out, but supposedly U of Illinois had already spent a chunk of money, no shock, and so they threatened him with a lawsuit to keep him involved.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Andy</p><p>Partch had problems with two well-known choreographers -Martha Graham<br/>and Alwin Nikolais.
