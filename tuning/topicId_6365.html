The New Grove&apos;s Dictionary<br/> of Music and Musicians mentions the use of a stretched octave and gives<br/> measurements of the scale steps: &gt;&gt;</p><p>This definition is problematic for several reasons,  the most important of<br/>which is that repertoire in slendro or pelog can just as well be played on<br/>ensembles without metallophones -- especially the plucked strings of a<br/>siteran group (or kechapi in Sunda), even (in Banyumas) unaccompanied vocal<br/>ensembles imitating a gamelan.  Further, an instrument like the gender<br/>(which is the metallophone to which all the others are tuned) has both a<br/>harmonic overtone structure and the overtones of the individual keys which --<br/>largely based on shape -- may vary enormously from one to the next.</p><p>A closer look at the data will show that octave stretching is by no means<br/>uniform. Octave Slendro:  0, 231, 474, 717, 955, 1208 cents.deviations may,<br/>in general, be used to create beats, but there is by no means a consistant<br/>pattern.  Pak Tjokro&apos;s gamelan, measured in Sethares&apos; book, is an example of<br/>a narrowed tuning. One of the few classical Javanese musicians with a<br/>profound interest in the subject of tuning, Ki Suhardi, actually prefers that<br/>the highest tones of the gender be less than an octave above the middle<br/>octave tones, and that the slenthem, which shares the same tones as the<br/>lowest octave of the gender, be tuned above the gender, thus his general<br/>tendency is towards narrow octaves.  Suhardi&apos;s son, Hartono, has just written<br/>a thesis at ISI in Yogya on the subject of Suhardi&apos;s tunings. Another factor<br/>that should be considered is that bronze rise in pitch over time, and the<br/>smaller keys rise faster than the larger ones -- so the stretching may not be<br/>a part of the initial tuning design.</p><p>The study by Wasisto Surjodiningrat et al has got to be taken in context.<br/>(Perhaps others can better evaluate the measurement techniques used.) The<br/>gamelans measured were selected on the basis of cultural rather than musical<br/>prestige. Although several instruments are indeed quite musically important,<br/>a gamelan being owned by a court is not evidence of it being in tune and may<br/>in fact be highly indictative of lack of maintenance or tuning, due to the<br/>present financial constraints of the courts. What was not considered at all<br/>by Surjodiningrat was the subjective evaluation of musicians as to the<br/>in-tuneness of particular gamelans.  His data would be much more useful if<br/>that question had been asked. For example, the famous 17th gamelan of the<br/>Istana Mankunegara, Kyai Kanyut Mesem, has an astonishing sound, but most<br/>musicians would agree that it was &quot;out of tune&quot;. Moreover, the tuning has<br/>been revised several times in this century alone, and at one point, the<br/>identity of the slendro pitches were shifted by one key.  Another pair of<br/>Mankunegaran gamelan have been arbitrarily combined and slightly retuned to<br/>be used as a practice instrument before performances on Kanyut Mesem.  One of<br/>the gamelan in the Pura Pakualam is famous for having a pitch 1 slendro that<br/>is too high.  The most widely copied gamelan -- that of the radio station in<br/>Solo --  actually had the loud and soft instruments tuned separately by<br/>different tuners and it certainly sounds like it.</p><p>Scholarship in Javanese tunings (and I would here insert the names Perlman<br/>and Polansky, and Weintraub for Sunda -- I summarized his dissertation on<br/>this list earlier) has moved well beyond simply making measurements to<br/>actually describing the process by which a gamelan smith tunes.</p></div>
