Leopold<br/>gives a list of several well-known writers on<br/>well-temperament, including Sauveur and Neidhardt<br/>as well as Werckmeister.</p><p>i *do* know that Leopold&apos;s book contains exercises<br/>in which the violinist is specifically instructed<br/>to play the sharps lower than the flats, and the<br/>exercises are specifically to develop facility in<br/>playing all scales correctly in a 19-note extended<br/>meantone, which is what he recommended for the violin.<br/>the exercises quoted in the Chesnut article use a<br/>meantone chain of 5ths from Gb to B#.</p><p>in W.A. Mozart&apos;s handwritten notes preserved by his<br/>student Thomas Attwood, Mozart gives a table of<br/>chromatic pitches, always extending to at least<br/>17 different notes but sometimes as many as 21,<br/>and he labels the diatonic and chromatic semitones<br/>accordingly, always indicating that the flats should<br/>be higher than their &quot;enharmonically-equivalent&quot; sharps.</p><p>so most likely both Leopold and Wolfgang would have<br/>recommended a well-temperament such as Werckmeister III<br/>for keyboards.  but it is clear, from descriptions in<br/>both Leopold&apos;s violin method and in the Attwood notes,<br/>that for non-keyboard instruments a 17 to 21-note<br/>chain of extended meantone was assumed as &quot;correct<br/>intonation&quot;, or, as Leopold described it, &quot;right ratio<br/>tuning&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Why would a composer using extended meantone not want<br/>&gt; to use pure thirds since there are extensions available<br/>&gt; for any harmonic need?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why would Mozart, under the influence of Johann<br/>&gt; Christian Bach (the youngest son of JS Bach) use<br/>&gt; sixth comma meantone when the England was so notorious<br/>&gt; for its use of quarter comma meantone (and JS was so<br/>&gt; negative about Silbermann&apos;s reputed use of sixth comma)?</p><p>well, Gene has been making the argument for 31edo<br/>or 1/4-comma meantone as a good Mozart tuning.  there<br/>is no basis for asserting that 55edo or 1/6-comma was<br/>&quot;the&quot; Mozart tuning, and in fact any variety of meantone<br/>would work.</p><p>the crucial point is that Leopold describes flats as<br/>being &quot;a comma higher&quot; than their enharmonically-equivalent<br/>sharps.</p><p>(see L.

A. Mozart lived in London and was<br/>&gt; influenced by J. C. Bach, i find it likely that he&apos;d<br/>&gt; give much more weight to the opinions of his own<br/>&gt; father than to those of the younger Bach&apos;s father.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Monz, check out Heinz Gartner&apos;s book &quot;John Christian Bach: Mozart&apos;s Friend<br/>and Mentor&quot; translated by Reinhard G. Pauly, Amadeus Press, Portland, Oregon.<br/>It tells you more than that Mozart lived in London.</p><p>Also, J. Christian Bach was the most famous musician of his time, AND<br/>considered his father the &quot;Old Wig,&quot; and that he recieved no direct music lessons<br/>from his father as he was too young when JS died in 1750.  It was CPE Bach that<br/>was the big influence.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; so now, can we finally agree that 55edo and its<br/>&gt; relatives were the tunings intended by Mozart for<br/>&gt; his orchestral and chamber works?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Why rush too judgment?

Boethius, in his famous treatise<br/>written c. 505 AD, shows a mathematical proof that the<br/>whole-tone is larger than 8 commas but smaller than 9,<br/>with the purpose of deflating the statement that<br/>&quot;whole-tone = 9 commas&quot;.  so that idea must have<br/>already been current in his day or earlier.</p><p>(unfortunately, Boethius&apos;s method contains the<br/>mathematical error of multiplying a linear difference,<br/>rather than multiplying the ratio by itself over<br/>and over again.  today, we do it by either taking<br/>the log and multiplying *that*, or by using<br/>prime-factor notation and adding/subtracting the<br/>exponents.</p><p>Boethius was a very erudite scholar, and probably was<br/>aware of the error in his method and used it anyway,<br/>because he&apos;s dealing with the Pythagorean comma here,<br/>and multiplying the ratios would have resulted in<br/>monstrous numbers of up to 52 digits -- i know,<br/>because i did the calculations myself -- and don&apos;t<br/>forget, he was using Roman numerals!  but the<br/>discrepancy between his erroneous method and the<br/>correct one is so small that it hardly matters, and<br/>he probably knew that too.)</p><p>in this particular Mozart case, Tosi described<br/>tone = 9 commas = diatonic + chromatic semitone,<br/>diatonic semitone = 5 commas, and<br/>chromatic semitone = 4 commas; and Tosi was cited<br/>by Leopold Mozart, in a letter to Wolfgang, as an<br/>&quot;authoritative source&quot; on the matter of intonation.</p><p>as i said, the crucial point in determining Mozart&apos;s<br/>(senior and junior) intonation is Leopold&apos;s statement<br/>that &quot;the flats are a comma higher than the sharps&quot;.</p><p>i just did some calculations, and i see that the<br/>range of meantones which give an &quot;enharmonic&quot; difference<br/>about the size of any of the usual commas, are those<br/>which flatten each 5th by between about 0.165 and .0183<br/>of a syntonic comma.  the enharmonic difference between<br/>flats and sharps for these two examples is ~19.12244302<br/>and ~23.76780157 cents, respectively.</p><p>1/6-comma is 0.166666...-comma, and 55edo is<br/>~0.175445544-comma.</p><p>now, if the Mozarts were fond of tossing about the<br/>term &quot;comma&quot; in a general sense to mean any number<br/>of small intervals, as some people are here on this<br/>list, then perhaps a good argument could be made for<br/>other varieties of meantone.</p><p>but my guess is that the well-read Mozarts knew enough<br/>about intonation to know the difference between a<br/>comma and a diesis, which would limit their preferred<br/>non-keyboard tunings to something in the range i describe<br/>above.</p><p>(but then again, those people on this list who use<br/>&quot;comma&quot; in a general sense also know quite a bit about<br/>intonation.  oh well ...)</p><p>anyway, if they had in mind the general conception<br/>conforming to Tosi&apos;s description, then 55edo is the winner.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=44672 href="#44672">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2003 4:30:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Gene,</p><p>&gt; From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, June 15, 2003 4:06 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Mozart 31-equal??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the crucial point is that Leopold describes flats as<br/>&gt; &gt; being &quot;a comma higher&quot; than their enharmonically-equivalent<br/>&gt; &gt; sharps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we take a Didymus comma, that means a fifth f satisfying<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 128/f^12 = 81/80,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which gives an f of 698.208 cents, or 4/23 comma meantone.<br/>&gt; If it is a comma of Pythagoras instead, we get 698.045 cents,<br/>&gt; or 2/11 comma meantone almost precisely.</p><p>thanks!

I do not believe this to be true.</p><p>they could hear just intervals. tempered intervals, if truly<br/>identical in logarithmic measurement, would beat faster in higher<br/>registers, and hence sound different. thus, for four fifths that<br/>added up to a just major third, logarithmically identical measurement<br/>could only have been achieved by accident. this point is made over<br/>and over on page after page in jorgensen, and i firmly believe it to<br/>be true having toiled over tuning my piano in 1/4-comma meantone in<br/>the past. you will of course say that one can hear these fifths<br/>*melodically* and make them melodically identical, to within 1 cent.<br/>i will of course retort that the just noticeable difference for<br/>melodic intervals is over 5 cents. you claim you can do better. let<br/>me make a CD of various tempered fifths in various registers and see<br/>if you can identify them to the cent. maybe you&apos;ve trained yourself<br/>to do so (i&apos;ll believe it when i see it), but you&apos;ve had access to<br/>precise tuning devices that were not available in werckmeister&apos;s<br/>time . . . let&apos;s put it this way. it would take a rare ear, perhaps a<br/>reinhard but certainly not a jorgensen, to be able to reliably<br/>tune &quot;identical&quot; (to within a cent, say) tempered fifths without the<br/>aid of techniques and technologies introduced after werckmeister&apos;s<br/>time.</p></div><h3><a id=44790 href="#44790">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2003 1:27:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>though it seems obvious,<br/>&gt; it was actually unknown to the tuning community in those days, and<br/>&gt; equal-beating tended to be used instead until the &quot;obvious&quot; law of<br/>&gt; progressive beating was published. see jorgenson for details.</p><p>It seems to me one obvious starting point is no beating of major<br/>thirds; if you fill in the four fifths using equal beating, your<br/>error wouldn&apos;t be so bad.</p></div><h3><a id=44791 href="#44791">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2003 1:41:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; though it seems obvious,<br/>&gt; &gt; it was actually unknown to the tuning community in those days,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; equal-beating tended to be used instead until the &quot;obvious&quot; law<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; progressive beating was published. see jorgenson for details.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems to me one obvious starting point is no beating of major<br/>&gt; thirds; if you fill in the four fifths using equal beating, your<br/>&gt; error wouldn&apos;t be so bad.</p><p>right, this is what i was talking about to begin with. but the fifths<br/>would end up being tempered by quite different amounts -- for<br/>example, for two fifths a perfect fifth apart which beat at the same<br/>rate, the lower one is tempered about 50% more than the higher one,<br/>right? jorgensen&apos;s book contains exact figures for what such a<br/>strategy would have produced using the typical bearing plans (which<br/>notes are tuned first, before proceeding up and down by octaves) of<br/>the time.</p></div><h3><a id=44794 href="#44794">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>6/17/2003 2:50:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 6/17/03 3:16:46 PM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com">wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; how did it get there? it was only an ideal, and only achieved in an<br/>&gt; *average* sense by tuners aiming for 1/4-comma meantone and tuning<br/>&gt; all the major thirds just.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Over a hundred years of practice is one way.
