Again, there is a business risk to not<br/>paying attention.  I have the concrete example of the notation<br/>programs Finale and Sibelius. Each have active company-sponsored as<br/>well as independent forums for their programs. The independent<br/>formums tend to be populated by professional users with high demands<br/>for engraving. In recent years a large number of Finale users have<br/>migrated to Sibelius specifically because Sibelius has had an<br/>official presence in the independent lists, and that presence has<br/>been helpful and open and concretely demonstrated that issues raised<br/>on the list have been resolved in updates or are at least actively<br/>being pursued.  Finale, on the other hand, resolutely kept their<br/>employees from establishing an official presence on the independent<br/>list, a mistake which has now been corrected and I believe that<br/>results are already apparent in an improved path to customer<br/>influence over product development.</p><p>The membership on this list can well be hard on a product, but they<br/>can also been tremendously helpful in making a product better.  In<br/>the end, there may be aspects of your products that are deal breakers<br/>for many of us, but perhaps listening a bit more closely before<br/>jumping, tortoise-like, into a defensive mode might alleviate these<br/>concerns.

For some years now FTS has been bundled with the Lambdoma keyboard for hardware retuning.

One aspect that springs to mind is the special staff you use for microtonal notation. Perhaps keyboard layouts too if geninely new and your invention.  But I&apos;d have thought also that you would be too late for that too, as you are supposed take out a patent first - at least make a provisional application - before you make it publically available should you not?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=78396 href="#78396">ðŸ”—</a>Cornell III, Howard M &#x3C;howard.m.cornell.iii@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/2/2008 11:29:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I think you have one year after you &quot;disclose&quot; the invention.

I wasn&apos;t supposed to discuss it publically with anyone, until I got the provisional patent, and until then if you told anyone about it you were supposed to ask them to agree to a non disclosure agreement. However the provisional patent was very easy to obtain, you just needed to describe the invention in ordinary language, it didn&apos;t need to be a legal document.
