(or is it<br/>&gt; Christiaan&apos;?)</p><p>Thank you for this correction; I wonder if I was thinking of the<br/>modern performer and author Christoper Page &lt;grin&gt;. Of course you&apos;re<br/>right, and Barbour has &apos;Christian Huyghens&apos;.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s description of his tuning system and his archicembalo<br/>appears in his treatise of 1555, _Antica musica ridotta alla moderna<br/>prattica_, translated in a recent complete English edition by Maria<br/>Maniates, _Ancient Music Adapted to Modern Practice_ (New Haven and<br/>London: Yale University Press, 1996). Maybe _ridotta_ could also be<br/>rendered as &quot;reduced,&quot; although &quot;adapted&quot; seems a nice translation of<br/>Vicentino&apos;s approach.</p><p>Costeley&apos;s presentation of 19-tet appears in the Preface to his<br/>_Musique_ of 1570, in a commentary on his included chromatic spiritual<br/>chanson _Seigneur Dieu ta pitie/_ based on this tuning. For a<br/>fascinating discussion of both the tuning and the chanson, see Kenneth<br/>J. Levy, &quot;Costeley&apos;s Chromatic Chanson,&quot; _Annales Musicologues:<br/>Moyen-Age et Renaissance_, Tome III (1955), pp. 213-261.</p><p>Costeley&apos;s statement mentions that he composed the chanson about 12<br/>years previously (c. 1558), and gives an interesting description of a<br/>19-tet keyboard, see Levy at pp. 214-216:</p><p>&quot;...it is necessary to add, within a keyboard octave containing eight<br/>white keys and five black ones, another seven black keys, thus making<br/>twelve black keys in all, distributed among the eight white ones....<br/>The white and black keys will then be graduated by equal intervals of<br/>a third of a tone, from one end to the other, providing the means of<br/>achieving thereby something admirably agreeable and novel.&quot;</p><p>Costeley&apos;s &quot;eight white keys&quot; in an octave evidently include the keys<br/>at both the beginning and end of the octave, e.g.:</p><p>                          Cb=                  Fb=<br/>  F# Gb   G# Ab   A# Bb   B#   C# Db   Eb D#   E#<br/>F       G       A       B    C       D       E    F</p><p>Thanks to John Chalmers and Brian McLaren for calling my attention to<br/>this article and discussing it with me, although glitches (of which<br/>I&apos;ve proved myself well capable of twice in the last Digest) are, of<br/>course, my responsibility.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
