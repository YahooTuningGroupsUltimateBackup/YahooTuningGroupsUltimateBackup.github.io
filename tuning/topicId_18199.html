If we&apos;re going to<br/>be re-defining terms, Bosanquet&apos;s &quot;double positive&quot; would be the obvious<br/>one.  This kind of temperament is characteristic of the equal temperaments<br/>with 2+12n notes.  Although the terms aren&apos;t identical (96- and 118-equal<br/>are double positive but schismic) they&apos;re close enough that something like<br/>&quot;continuous double positive&quot; should be clear.</p><p>By association, schismic scales could be referred to as &quot;continuously<br/>single positive&quot; and meantones as &quot;continuously double negative&quot;.</p><p>That also means the family of meantone-like scales where the whole tone is<br/>divided into two equal parts, and t/2 + s is associated with 7:8, can be<br/>described as &quot;continuously double negative&quot;.  These are 14, 26, 38, 50,<br/>etc.  Note that 50-equal is both singly and doubly negative in this<br/>continuous realm.</p><p>The neutral third MOS can also be neatly described as &quot;continuously<br/>septimally double positive&quot; after Wilson.</p><p>At the bottom of his 1975 paper where he introduces the term &quot;septimally<br/>positive&quot; Erv Wilson does say &quot;By &grave;system&apos; I do not limit the meaning to<br/>closed equal cycles.  If the beginning member of a linear series forms (in<br/>this case) a &grave;quasi-fifth&apos; to the ending member of the series, which<br/>subtends the same number of scale-degrees as the remaining (typical)<br/>&grave;fifths&apos; of the series -- a moment of symmetry is formed having scale-like<br/>and systematic properties.  These are important, and I will go into them<br/>at another time.&quot;  Which looks like it means &quot;septimally positive&quot; refers<br/>primarily to systems with a &quot;&grave;Fifth&apos; larger than 4/7 &grave;Octave&apos;&quot; and only<br/>secondarily to the scales with 5+7n equal steps to the &quot;octave&quot;.</p><p>However, Wilson doesn&apos;t consider doubly positive or negative scales.  That<br/>conveniently avoids the confusion between 5-equal being &quot;double negative&quot;<br/>by Bosanquet&apos;s ET-based definition, but &quot;single negative&quot; by the MOS one.<br/> In which case &quot;septimally double positive&quot; may be a neologism, although<br/>it&apos;s an obvious combination of Bosanquet and Wilson&apos;s ideas.</p><p>If confusion&apos;s unavoidable, I&apos;d prefer the general naming scheme that<br/>covers 5 of my favourite temperament families, and has the potential to<br/>name a lot more, than to keep inventing Greek looking words.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=18293 href="#18293">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>2/3/2001 1:29:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt; Nice to hear -- I wonder if you have any reactions to other people&apos;s<br/>&gt; approaches to alternative tonality, for example Bohlen/Pierce,<br/>&gt; Balzano/Zweifel, Clough/Carey/Clampitt, Kraehenbuehl/Schmidt, Yasser,<br/>&gt; Euler/Fokker, Goldsmith, Von Hoerner . . . ?</p><p>The simple answer is that I don&apos;t know much about them.  And if there<br/>isn&apos;t anything on the web, I&apos;m not likely to find out much more.  But<br/>let&apos;s got through in order.</p><p>&gt;Bohlen/Pierce</p><p>The Bohlen/Pierce scale sounds pleasant enough.  On the &quot;BP Tonality&quot; page<br/>&lt;<a href="http://members.aol.com/bpsite/tonality.html">http://members.aol.com/bpsite/tonality.html</a>&gt; there isn&apos;t very much.  A<br/>primary consonance and some scales, but no standard progressions or<br/>characteristic dissonances.</p><p>&gt;Balzano/Zweifel</p><p>I&apos;ve heard of Balzano.  Can&apos;t remember why.</p><p>&gt;Clough/Carey/Clampitt</p><p>My response to that &quot;Self-Similar Pitch Structure&quot; paper is much as I said<br/>at the time.  It doesn&apos;t seem to have much connection to music.  The basic<br/>idea ties in with Wilson&apos;s MOS anyway, &quot;Well Formedness&quot; seems to be<br/>useful, in that chords or tunes can be transposed and still make sense.<br/>Again, nothing about chord progressions, only defining the scales.</p><p>&gt;Kraehenbuehl/Schmidt</p><p>Don&apos;t know</p><p>&gt;Yasser</p><p>The bits I&apos;ve heard about sound fairly nutty, so I haven&apos;t looked any<br/>further.</p><p>&gt; Euler/Fokker</p><p>They both talk good sense from what I&apos;ve seen.  But not really what I was<br/>calling &quot;alternative tonality&quot;.  More alternative consonances, in the<br/>meantone tradition.</p><p>&gt; Goldsmith, Von Hoerner</p><p>Don&apos;t know</p><p>&gt; . . .</p><p>The first thing that sprang to mind was Walter O&apos;Connell&apos;s &quot;The Tonality<br/>of the Golden Section&quot; from Xenharmonikon 15.  The interesting feature is<br/>that it uses inharmonic timbres but preserves the coincidence between<br/>partials and resultant tones you get from the harmonic series.  So it<br/>might allow for a deeper sense of tonality than other inharmonic timbres.</p><p>Well, I decided to set it up and find out.  It doesn&apos;t sound as convincing<br/>as the Bohlen-Pierce scale, which is partly because Golden ratio timbres<br/>don&apos;t sound as nice as square waves.  Also because the consonances aren&apos;t<br/>so consonant.  Although the sense of &quot;octave equivalence&quot; is very strong<br/>-- more so than with the usual octaves and harmonic timbres.  And the dyad<br/>of pretend and real octave is consonant.  So there could be some value in<br/>dyadic music.</p><p>The paper doesn&apos;t even give any chords, let alone progressions or<br/>characteristic dissonances.  So again, not really &quot;alternative tonality&quot;,<br/>but then tonality wasn&apos;t fashionable back then.</p><p>It may be Setharian techniques could yield a better scale for that timbre.<br/> I don&apos;t know if that would be any help for the general problem of<br/>inharmonic tonality, because there are still only two timbres with the<br/>special property.  And the harmonic series probably has a special place in<br/>our brains, more important that its acoustic properties.</p><p>That aside, I still think there&apos;s potential in inharmonic timbres.  My<br/>experiments with the neutral third scales show strong chord progressions<br/>can work with out otonal, or even particularly consonant, chords.  So find<br/>an inharmonic timbre that gives something like fifths and octaves, and see<br/>what happens.  It&apos;s a field I&apos;m interested in, but I need to find the time<br/>to collect samples, find scales and the like.  I&apos;m thinking of something<br/>like what the music in Dancer in the Dark should have been.  Have it grow<br/>out of incidental sounds, instead of using a few samples in the<br/>introduction and then fade them out when the orchestra kicks in.  But<br/>still mix in harmonic sounds where they&apos;re needed.</p><p>So there you go.  In summary, I haven&apos;t seen anything as relevant as your<br/>or Margo&apos;s work, but that may be because it wasn&apos;t pushed at me through<br/>this list.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=18299 href="#18299">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>2/3/2001 2:34:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That aside, I still think there&apos;s potential in inharmonic timbres.<br/>My<br/>&gt; experiments with the neutral third scales show strong chord<br/>progressions<br/>&gt; can work with out otonal, or even particularly consonant, chords.<br/>So find<br/>&gt; an inharmonic timbre that gives something like fifths and octaves,<br/>and see<br/>&gt; what happens.
