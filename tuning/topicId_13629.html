I am going into the studio pronto to start work on<br/>the next CD, a lot of it was done before Acoustic Stick was recorded.<br/>It&apos;s very heavy rock in places, and a total switch from my last 2.<br/>Paolo, you know, when I tune my guitars, micro or 12, I have gotten to a<br/>place where I use my intuitions as to how I tune, and this usually<br/>involves trying to get the piece I&apos;m playing at the time to sound the<br/>way I want it. I&apos;ve discovered, more by accident than conscious thought,<br/>when I play, say, a classical guitar gig on my nylon string guitar, that<br/>I find myself retuning for each new tune (or key, as the case may be),<br/>and it really seems to help me sound &quot;in tune,&quot; even though the 12 tone<br/>system is far from it. If I am in F, I try to get it sounding good...if<br/>my next piece is in E minor, I definitely tweak things from the previous<br/>key...works real well. Tuning seems to be more of an art, rather than a<br/>science, and I have found that the more I trust my heart, the better my<br/>music sounds...it&apos;s a hoot, for sure...Hstick</p></div>
