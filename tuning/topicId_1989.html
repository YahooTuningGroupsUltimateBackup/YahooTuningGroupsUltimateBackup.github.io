I got an opinion.<br/>1. Hardly anybody I know listens to algorithmic compositions, and I don&apos;t<br/>know what a humaniser is. But lots of people like to make music, and<br/>keyboards are a pretty good design for making it easily, and accompanying<br/>others.<br/>2. Technology has changed, but human nature has remained more-or-less the<br/>same, for millennia. The music of the past still speaks to people in a way<br/>that lots of music of the present doesn&apos;t -- and it sounds best on the<br/>instruments it was written for.</p><p>Judy<br/>On Tue, 23 Mar 1999, Sarn Richard Ursell wrote:</p><p>&gt; Keyboards are obsolete, at least in my opinion, what, today with sequencers<br/>&gt; and humanisers, and now AI composition, and algorithmic composition?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any opinions?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Judy,</p><p>You sure do have an opinion...... :o)</p><p>You act like I have insulted you.<br/>I ment no offence, what so ever.</p><p>One of my hobbies, and in fact-a fasination with me is AI composition,<br/>whereby the computer composes music, at the control of a few parameters.</p><p>You may want to check out David Cope&apos;s SARA, he has two books available from<br/>A-R editions.</p><p>If you read my last post very, VERY CAREFULLY, you will notice that I made<br/>ABSOLUTELY NO negative comments towards life music at all.</p><p>In my opinion, the best sort of music is a BLEND, a HYBRID of live, sampled,<br/>synthesized, sequenced music.</p><p>A &quot;humanizer&quot;, is, a computer algorithm, (or set of rules, always leading to<br/>a solution, or result), that adds a &quot;rough quality&quot; to perfectly in time<br/>music, the kind of roughness that a live drummer would make, as would a live<br/>keyboardist.</p><p>We must move with the times.<br/>Face reality.</p><p>Look, I did not say that algorithmic composition was better than human<br/>composed music, and believe it, for every one of your friends, relatives and<br/>equaintances who DOSEN&apos;T listen to complexity, genetic, Brownian,<br/>Stochastic, chaotic, or prime number music, there are many people on the<br/>planet who do.</p><p>Check the Internet.</p><p>The proof is &quot;in the pudding&quot;.</p><p>Sarn.</p></div>
