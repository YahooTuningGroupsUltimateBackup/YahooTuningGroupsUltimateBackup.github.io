So, what to<br/>make of that decision, except that the idea of the composition, the<br/>essential meaning, is more important than the means to get that message<br/>across. I agree with that idea of art (but it&apos;s fine with me that others<br/>may not), because I like the idea of the endless variety of music that<br/>could arise from thinking that way. Bach, of course, was the Maestro,<br/>big time, of Western harmonic concepts, spinning line after line of<br/>beautiful variations on his themes...they have great technique, real<br/>emotional/spiritual depth, and flawless compositional logic...Papa Bach,<br/>indeed. He&apos;s one for the ages.<br/>    I don&apos;t think this debate will ever be resolved, but it is<br/>interesting to see people&apos;s views on it. I&apos;ve said this before, but here<br/>it is now: I really don&apos;t feel, on the deepest levels, that my music<br/>&quot;belongs&quot; to me...it&apos;s some sort of gift from somewhere much bigger than<br/>me, and I&apos;m just kind of along for the ride. Far from discouraging<br/>another musician from playing a tune of mine in another fashion, I would<br/>be delighted if someone actually liked my music enough to want to play<br/>it. The less restrictions placed on art, the better...imagination is a<br/>very powerful force in the Universe, and has changed the face of the<br/>world more than once. I really enjoy hearing folks coming up with their<br/>own take on an idea...perhaps one person will bring out something<br/>someone else missed....I would (and do) encourage all musicians ( all<br/>artists) to put their own stamp on whatever they&apos;re doing...Hstick</p></div>
