It&apos;s<br/>fascinating to be able say both, &quot;Here&apos;s how Vicentino approaches<br/>16th-century JI, as you&apos;ll hear in this performance&quot;; and &quot;Here&apos;s how<br/>John deLaubenfels approaches it 445 years later.&quot; We can learn, and<br/>grow, from both experiences.</p><p>The main point I would make about Vicentino&apos;s scheme is that it is a<br/>_16th-century_ scheme of _5-limit_ adaptive JI, and should be viewed<br/>artistically in that context. This isn&apos;t at all to exclude dialogue<br/>where you (John and Paul) and others see how well it does or doesn&apos;t<br/>fit other styles or periods; it might fit some 18th-century music, for<br/>example, just as 1/4-comma meantone might fit some of Mozart very<br/>nicely (using as many notes per octave as required).</p><p>Also, using Vicentino&apos;s method as a kind of &quot;benchmark&quot; for various<br/>styles and periods -- can &quot;adaptive tuning system X&quot; do as well or<br/>better? -- is fine.</p><p>What I&apos;d like to emphasize is simply that this is a 16th-century<br/>scheme for 16th-century music, which Vicentino himself described as<br/>&quot;mixed and tempered music.&quot;</p><p>If we focus on this primary setting and purpose of Vicentino&apos;s<br/>adaptive JI system, we may be able to answer a number of questions and<br/>maybe even to propose some &quot;educated guesses&quot; about what a performer<br/>_might_ have done at the keyboard to handle certain &quot;problem<br/>situations.&quot; Of course, these &quot;answers&quot; and &quot;guesses&quot; are quite likely<br/>to reflect my own viewpoints and biases; someone like Judith Conrad,<br/>who plays (and _tunes_) actual historical instruments may have lots<br/>more to say from a more informed perspective.</p><p>First of all, as Paul Erlich has observed, a sonority with two fifths<br/>or fourths, or a fifth and a fourth, such as C-G-D or C-F-G, is an<br/>independent concord in the Gothic and 20th-century eras of Western<br/>European and related compositional styles (mildly unstable in some<br/>Gothic styles, possibly stable in modern styles), but definitely a<br/>dissonance in the 16th century, more specifically a suspension or the<br/>like. Having one of those fifths or fourths tempered in the usual<br/>meantone manner is no problem, in my view.</p><p>From experience (albeit on a synthesizer rather than a period organ or<br/>harpsichord), however, I know that handling these sonorities with a<br/>classic JI system like Zarlino&apos;s 15-note or 16-note octave _is_ a<br/>problem, because in D-G-A one of those fifths or fourths is going to<br/>be impure by a full syntonic comma! By all means give me a meantone<br/>compromise in a 16th-century setting; in a medieval setting, where we<br/>do want to maximize the consonance of these sonorities, Pythagorean<br/>gives a very nice and pure 6:8:9.</p><p>How about C-G-A? As Thomas Morley (1597) tells us, taking &quot;the fifth<br/>and sixth together&quot; is done mainly when &quot;a discord is taken,&quot; and can<br/>make &quot;the best of closes&quot; -- that is, it&apos;s a combination with tension<br/>leading up to a cadence.</p><p>Again, G-A is not a 5-odd-limit interval, and Vicentino&apos;s system is<br/>designed to get pure 5-odd-limit concords, not to optimize every<br/>dissonant sonority also. Since C-G-A is a point of tension, having the<br/>fifth in meantone, for example, shouldn&apos;t hurt and might possibly<br/>underscore the musical action at this point.</p><p>How about a more serious practical problem: situations like the very<br/>common 16th-century progression between two sonorities where the bass<br/>moves by a third, e.g., in a MIDI-like notation with C4 as middle C:</p><p>F4 F4      G4 G4<br/>C4 D4      E4 E4<br/>A3 A3      C4 B3<br/>F3 D3  or  C3 E3</p><p>For a real-time performer as opposed to a player-harpsichord or MIDI<br/>sequencer or the like, there&apos;s a solution I&apos;d like to dare to mention:<br/>now and then, revert to common meantone. In other words, Vicentino&apos;s<br/>scheme could be used by an expert performer to get frequent and<br/>beautiful adaptive JI, but not necessarily &quot;perfect&quot; adaptive JI.</p><p>The beauty of Vicentino&apos;s scheme, in my view, is that either manual has a<br/>quite serviceable meantone tuning to &quot;fall back on&quot; at points where the<br/>complexities of absolutely consistent adaptive JI might overwhelm the<br/>player.</p><p>The first of 31-note-division tuning of Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo may also<br/>support this kind of viewpoint. With his practical 36-note instrument,<br/>having used 31 notes for the complete meantone cycle, he used the<br/>remaining five as &quot;comma keys&quot; for pure fifths with the most frequently<br/>used diatonic notes -- or, in his theoretical 38-note version, seven such<br/>keys providing pure fifths for the usual diatonic notes.</p><p>What this says to me is that Vicentino was considering adaptive JI as a<br/>beautiful effect even if it could only be used at _certain_ points in a<br/>piece, just as a viol consort might tune many but not all sonorities with<br/>just fifths and thirds. With the 31-note system, a pure sonority now and<br/>then was considered worthwhile against a backdrop of meantone. With the<br/>full adaptive JI system, maybe a meantone interval or sonority here and<br/>there in a setting of more frequent vertical JI was likewise considered<br/>fine.</p><p>Rather than speak of a departure from pure vertical JI as &quot;pain,&quot;<br/>although this is certainly a graphic term, John, I might speak more<br/>gently of &quot;stress&quot; or &quot;tension.&quot; Either a minor third or fifth<br/>tempered as in the common meantone of the 16th century, or a fifth a<br/>syntonic comma narrow, is &quot;impure&quot; -- but there is a certain<br/>difference here in the level of stress or tension.</p><p>From a likely Renaissance viewpoint, or at any rate my viewpoint as<br/>someone who finds 1/4-comma meantone natural and beautiful for this<br/>music, meantone on keyboards is the norm, and emulating Ptolemy&apos;s<br/>syntonic diatonic on a keyboard an &quot;extraordinary&quot; effect. Vicentino<br/>himself, in his writings, takes temperament as the norm and the &quot;pure<br/>fifth&quot; tuning as a special effect.</p><p>In short, I suspect that an adept performer may in practice have mixed<br/>much of the best (adaptive vertical JI) with some of the merely good<br/>(normal meantone). With automated performance, of course, we can now<br/>produce Vicentino&apos;s potential best: a beautiful system of vertical JI<br/>for 16th-century music, nicely fitting its scheme of concord/discord.</p><p>In a radically different context, this is the approach I have taken<br/>with a &quot;multi-prime&quot; neo-Gothic JI scheme combining pure fifths with<br/>14:11 major thirds and the like. One 12-note keyboard I tune in this<br/>scheme, the other in standard Pythagorean with pure fifths and fourths<br/>in all the accustomed places. If in doubt, I can simply revert to<br/>Pythagorean. Here the shift typically involves a comma of 896:891, a<br/>bit less than 10 cents, with the shift in Vicentino&apos;s system typically<br/>smaller (1/4 syntonic comma, ~5.38 cents).</p><p>With Vicentino&apos;s scheme, my main reaction is this: &quot;Now that we have<br/>the technology to pull this off by means of automated performance,<br/>let&apos;s hear this great composer&apos;s extraordinary and ingenious<br/>intonation applied to 16th-century music.&quot;</p><p>Just as Judith Conrad&apos;s performances on historical instruments don&apos;t<br/>prevent others from using electronic ones for the same repertories, so<br/>Vicentino&apos;s scheme doesn&apos;t prevent us from using others. However, it<br/>would be very sad if performances on historical instruments stopped --<br/>or if Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI scheme weren&apos;t heard in all its wonder.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=14352 href="#14352">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2000 12:36:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo, thanks for your post.
