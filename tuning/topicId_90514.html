The formula is xq - p for interval x and WC p/q. With x = 2^11/12 and p/q = 11/6 we get xq - p = 0.32649...while 0.101989...for p/q = 15/8. So 15/8 is definitely closer. These were the 5th and 7th WC&apos;s. The 8th is 17/9 and is even closer at -0.01026...which I didn&apos;t learn till right now.

Finding &quot;the&quot; interval presents no problem. OTOH these ambiguities are mainly arising for intervals more remote from the tonic, which is not completely unexpected (b5, and those above the fifth). From standard harmony we know that they can be arrived at either as inversions of the &apos;simpler&apos; intervals in the lower half (e.g. min 6 is an inverted maj 3) or as simpler intervals from other degrees (e.g. maj 7 is maj 3 from fifth). Looking at the maj 7 as an inversion of the semitone as 18/17 we get 17/9 which is in the list. Or as 5/4 from 3/2 we get 15/8 which is also there. And these are very close to the tempered interval x with a small R (I gave an example in the graphs). The fact that it&apos;s first three are the 8ve 2 also indicates the tonal weakness of this interval. For these, R is large, meaning that it can be seen as a badly tuned 8ve.</p><p>But to answer your question about finding &quot;the&quot; interval, I&apos;d found that for *rational* x there was one element that was closest and gave smallest R. But I hadn&apos;t checked this for irrational x and found that its not that straightforward, unfortunately. If you see something I&apos;ve missed please let me know.</p><p>Rick</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sat, Jun 19, 2010 at 12:43 AM, rick &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi everybody,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; While extracting the info from the waves proved very difficult, the end result itself is very simple. If x = interval, we simply take<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; x*k/(x - 1), where k = 1,2,3,... and round to get our numerator p,<br/>&gt; &gt; k/(x - 1) and round to get our denominator q, and of course take p/q.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; These will give our *k&apos;th* wave convergent. The strength of intervals depends on both the lowness of the convergents and the distance of x from p/q. The 12 tempered fifth for example gives {3/2, 3/2, 3/2,...} all the way and the distances from 3/2 are very small. Therefore it is a very good approximation. As an example, I&apos;ve attached a file showing the first 10 wave convergents for the 12 Tet intervals.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hope this comes in handy<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Rick<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=90562 href="#90562">ðŸ”—</a>rick &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2010 12:37:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well to answer the second question first, the reason is they are not really convergents. This is why I renamed them (or at least nick-named them) &apos;wave convergents&apos;. They are defined by rounding in the way I gave previously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t see how you can avoid getting 17/9 as a &quot;wave convergent&quot; without making an arbitrary choice somewhere along the line.<br/>&gt;<br/>Well you probably missed some earlier posts. I derived these from finding the *closest* periodic extrema of the original wave at times t = (2(k_1)+1)/2(a+b) to those of the envelope t = k_2/(a-b). By taking round [ak_2/(a-b)] = p and round [bk_2/(a-b)] = q we obtain k_1 = p+q and k_2 = p-q. The WC&apos;s are then p/q. This might seem like a &apos;jump&apos; but there&apos;s months of work behind it (which I won&apos;t restate now). I&apos;ll write it all up properly when I&apos;m finished.</p></div><h3><a id=90581 href="#90581">ðŸ”—</a>Andy &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2010 12:19:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 2^10/12, for example, goes back and forth between<br/>&gt; 7/4, 9/5, and 16/8, and all of these are in the general &quot;vicinity&quot; &gt; of the 2^(10/12).</p><p>Hi Rick,</p><p>simply try out<br/><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=continued+fraction+2^%2810%2F12%29">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=continued+fraction+2^%2810%2F12%29</a></p><p>oder if you do understand some german:<br/><a href="http://primzahlen.zeta24.com/de/online_kettenbruch_rationale_approximation.php">http://primzahlen.zeta24.com/de/online_kettenbruch_rationale_approximation.php</a></p><p>bye<br/>Andy</p></div><h3><a id=90582 href="#90582">ðŸ”—</a>Jeff Graham &#x3C;grahams828@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/24/2010 3:37:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>David Benson has an online book with a chapter on continued fractions.&nbsp; Google it up.</p><p>--- On Thu, 6/24/10, Andy &lt;a_sparschuh@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Andy &lt;a_sparschuh@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Method for finding the closest rational<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Thursday, June 24, 2010, 3:19 PM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 2^10/12, for example, goes back and forth between<br/>&gt; 7/4, 9/5, and 16/8, and all of these are in the general &quot;vicinity&quot; &gt; of the 2^(10/12).</p><p>Hi Rick,</p><p>simply try out<br/><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=continued+fraction+2^%2810%2F12%29">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=continued+fraction+2^%2810%2F12%29</a></p><p>oder if you do understand some german:<br/><a href="http://primzahlen.zeta24.com/de/online_kettenbruch_rationale_approximation.php">http://primzahlen.zeta24.com/de/online_kettenbruch_rationale_approximation.php</a></p><p>bye<br/>Andy</p></div>
