This whole business of dynamically re-assigning<br/>MIDI channels, in preparation for dynamically retuning them, has proven<br/>more difficult than I had anticipated.  I created a SHOOTLOAD of bugs in<br/>the process, and am still finding them.  All the multi-voice sequences<br/>I&apos;ve posted so far aren&apos;t &quot;quite right&quot;, I now learn (beyond, of course,<br/>the limitations in my current methods per se).</p><p>I woke up in the middle of the night and did the latest fix.  In<br/>celebration, I&apos;ve uploaded a really fun number called &quot;Caravan&quot; to the<br/>file area.</p><p>The &quot;tonic&quot; of the piece is F,Ab,C,D, or Fmin6 (?).  I wonder when<br/>chords like this first came into use (as tonic) - does anybody know?  I<br/>don&apos;t think any of the classical boys used it, but it&apos;s not uncommon in<br/>20th century popular music.</p><p>   <a href="http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/">http://www.egroups.com/files/tuning/</a><br/>   change into the JMids directory, and download <a href="http://caravan.zip">caravan.zip</a>.</p><p>Includes original 12-tET, 5-limit adaptive tuning, 7-limit adaptive<br/>tuning.</p><p>As always, I recommend the sweet rich 7-limit version.  When I had to go<br/>back and listen to a little of the original 12-tET today, it sounded SO<br/>sour and buzzy - bleccch!!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Paul H.

I&apos;d go with either the 1/6:1/5:1/4:2/7 or 10:12:15:17 instead, so<br/>&gt;that F Ab C is the usual 5-limit just minor triad rather than the<br/>&gt;subdominant-implying 6:7:9.</p><p>I understand what you&apos;re saying.  Any implication of the subdominant<br/>is a &quot;tonic killer&quot;.  But see if this is in fact what you hear in the<br/>tuning; I don&apos;t.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Paul H.
