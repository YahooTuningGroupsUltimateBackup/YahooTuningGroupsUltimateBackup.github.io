It is Rothenberg-proper where the modern 5-limit JI<br/>&gt; Indian shruti scale is not.

I&apos;ll let Paul answer that since it was his<br/>&quot;perhaps&quot;. There are a number in the Scala archive with &quot;indian&quot; and<br/>&quot;old&quot; in their name that do have this property, and Paul&apos;s and my<br/>proposed Shrutar tuning does resemble them more than it resembles the<br/>one simply called &quot;indian&quot; (the modern 5-limit JI).</p><p>Rothenberg-propriety (usually just called &quot;propriety&quot;) simply means<br/>that there are no intervals that are smaller than others while<br/>containing more shrutis. Or to put it the other way around, intervals<br/>composed of a certain number of shrutis are all smaller than (or equal<br/>in size to) all intervals containing more shrutis. If we can drop the<br/>&quot;or equal&quot; then it can be called &quot;strictly proper&quot;.</p><p>Paul can answer this better than I, but I don&apos;t think that propriety,<br/>or a smaller range of shruti sizes, were major design goals for the<br/>Shrutar tuning. It mostly just came out that way. Propriety is more<br/>likely to be important for recognition of the individual raga than it<br/>is for the entire 22-tone gamut (Is this correct usage of &quot;raga&quot; and<br/>&quot;gamut&quot;?).</p><p>Nor was it initially intended to include pitches which correspond to<br/>the 11-th harmonic of the drones. 7-th harmonics yes. But when the<br/>other goals had been acheived it turned out that very little extra<br/>tempering was required, in order to include 11s. So we did.</p><p>Here&apos;s Paul&apos;s seminal post on the topic.<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_16723.html#16723">/tuning/topicId_16723.html#16723</a></p><p>So you see the important requirements initially were that it contain<br/>the 5-limit 12-note lattice below, and that it add as many ratios of 7<br/>to this as possible within 22 notes, without being too uneven.</p><p>             5/4--15/8--45/32<br/>             / \   / \   / \<br/>            /   \ /   \ /   \<br/>    4/3---1/1---3/2---9/8--27/16<br/>    / \   / \   / \   /<br/>   /   \ /   \ /   \ /<br/>16/15--8/5---6/5---9/5</p><p>Here&apos;s the current proposal</p><p>! shrutar.scl<br/>!<br/>Paul Erlich&apos;s Shrutar tuning (from 9th fret) tempered with Dave Keenan</p><p> 22<br/>!<br/> 33/32<br/> 101.95500 ! 16/15 / (2048/2025)^(1/2)<br/> 12/11<br/> 9/8<br/> 262.02693 !  7/6  / (896/891)^(1/2)<br/> 6/5<br/> 5/4<br/> 9/7<br/> 4/3<br/> 11/8<br/> 595.11186 ! 45/32 * (2048/2025)^(1/4)<br/> 643.83808 ! 16/11 / (896/891)^(1/2)<br/> 3/2<br/> 760.07192 ! 14/9  / (896/891)^(1/2)<br/> 808.79814 !  8/5  / (2048/2025)^(1/4)<br/> 18/11<br/> 27/16<br/> 7/4<br/> 9/5<br/> 15/8<br/> 1141.88308 ! 27/14 * (896/891)^(1/2)<br/> 2/1</p><p>2048/2025 (19.55 c) is the diaschisma.
