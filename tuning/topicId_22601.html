I mean that the size of Erlich-Keenan generator that gives<br/>the lowest Maximum Absolute error over all 11-limit ratios happens to<br/>result in a just 5:9. A 5:9 is made up of 19 generators (less an<br/>octave), so this MA optimum generator is the 19th root of 18/5 ~=<br/>116.72c.

It&apos;s just that in any arbitrary 11-limit temperament,<br/>making the 4:11 just might well throw everything else so severely out<br/>of whack that it just wouldn&apos;t be worth it. It just so happens that in<br/>this case it gives quite good results. So by all means make one with a<br/>just 8:11 (preferably slowly beating, not phase-locked).</p></div><h3>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/12/2001 11:51:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; As an example of this I&apos;d say that QCM&apos;s just 5/4 is a relevant,<br/>&gt; primary consonance -- the primary consonance in fact.</p><p>I don&apos;t see that at all.

He used another term (which I<br/>couldn&apos;t find by flicking through) to (roughly) cover 19 to 12.
