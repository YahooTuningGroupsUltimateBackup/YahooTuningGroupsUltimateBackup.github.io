This makes 12-tET the borderline<br/>of meantone in one direction, since beyond that -8 fifths is a better<br/>approximation. And a fifth size of around 691.51c is the border in the<br/>other direction (26-tET is in, but 33-tET is out), since 11 fifths becomes<br/>a better approximation. This requirement also ensures a similar property<br/>for approximations to the 5:6 minor third.</p><p>Of course, the term &quot;meantone&quot; was coined to mean that the whole-tones of<br/>the tuning were close to the mean of the major and minor whole-tones, 9/8<br/>and 10/9, and the popular ones ranged from about 1/6 to 1/3 comma, centered<br/>on 1/4 comma (the exact mean).</p><p>I see people (myself included) casting about for a term that covers all<br/>tunings based on a single chain of approximate fifths. Thus we get<br/>travesties like so-called &quot;negative meantones&quot;, and the term &quot;Pythagorean&quot;<br/>being used for this purpose in Scala.</p><p>What&apos;s wrong with &quot;chain-of-fifths&quot;. Anyone have another suggestion?</p><p>We have people saying that Pythagorean is contained in meantone and others<br/>saying that meantone is contained in Pythagorean. Can&apos;t we agree that<br/>Pythagorean and meantone are disjoint or at least share only 12-tET as the<br/>borderline case of both. We can go further.</p><p>If I were asked to determine the other limit of the Pythagorean region I&apos;d<br/>put it at 17-tET, 705.8c (also 34-tET). This is where the optimum 4:5 flips<br/>from -8 to +9 fifths. I&apos;m not sure what to call the next region, but I&apos;d<br/>say it goes from 17-tET to 59-tET, 711.8c (22-tET and 27-tET are both in<br/>this region. Could be called the 22-tET region or the decatonic region or<br/>the Erlich region. Who was the earliest known proponent of 22-tET or<br/>tunings in general where 9 fifths is a major third?</p><p>So the known-world of chain-of-fifths tunings can be usefully divided into<br/>3 kingdoms:<br/>                   Chain-of-fifths<br/>                 /        |        \<br/>       | Meantone | Pythagorean | Erlichean? |<br/>     691.5c     700.0c        705.8c       711.8c   Borderline fifth size<br/>    59-tET*    12-tET        17-tET       59-tET    Borderline ETs<br/>11          4           -8            9          14 Fifths in a maj third</p><p>* It&apos;s kind of annoying that my proposed lower border of meantone doesn&apos;t<br/>correspond to (the best fifth in) any ET, but it turns out to be extremely<br/>close to the second-best fifth in 59-tET and may be conveniently considered<br/>as such, so we&apos;ve got 59-tET at both ends!</p><p>And beyond there be dragons (well wolves anyway).</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>aloe@xxx.xxx</h3><span>4/22/1999 11:07:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 01:36 PM 4/23/99 +1000, Dave Keenan wrote:</p><p>&gt;I see people (myself included) casting about for a term that covers all<br/>&gt;tunings based on a single chain of approximate fifths.

This is the overall<br/>view that the public seems to to hold of anything but the status quo.  As far<br/>as a technical description,  I also favor regular or irregular as<br/>descriptive.  The numbers that can be attached<br/>   I am selling Mr. Kirnberger and Young&apos;s ideas out there, but must cloak<br/>them in the mossy, classical drapes of &quot;culture&quot; to get past the fences.<br/>This is changing as more and more professional tuners become<br/>multi-temperament capable.  There has been a dearth of temperament change<br/>between 1900 and oh, say 1990.  A few, far-reaching tangents, (Partch, Ives<br/>etal) didn&apos;t really hit the mainstream, but there are growing numbers of new<br/>music lovers that are exposed to alternatives early.  To wit:<br/>   My 16 year old son has been listening to some of the most incredible<br/>garbage for several years. Thrash music from Maryilyn manson, etc.   Is it<br/>not wonderful that he   be so taken with Neil H&apos;stick&apos;s &quot;Acoustic Stick?&quot;<br/>and Bill Sethares&apos; &quot;Xentonality&quot;?<br/>     I would never have guessed it, but he is moving out of the common teen<br/>mud music and into some of the most avante-garde stuff I have heard recorded.<br/> Though he is not a musician, there *will* be future composers that arise out<br/>of a harmonic environment that we were, for the most part, denied.
