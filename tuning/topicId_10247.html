It&apos;s a little like eating &quot;tainted meat.&quot;  After those<br/>assessments, I don&apos;t know if I want to touch the stuff...</p><p>In any case... on this Web page I have included the first 45 seconds of<br/>&quot;Verklarte Neunzehn&quot;  (it may be changed after this, so don&apos;t be<br/>surprised) tuned in:</p><p>&quot;A septimal interpretation of 19 out of 31 tones, after Wilson<br/>(ahem..not)&quot;</p><p>19-31ji.scl  (This is the &quot;bad boy&quot; of scales that Paul Erlich latticed<br/>for me)</p><p>The second example is &quot;19 out of 31-tET.&quot;  This is obviously, a<br/>derivation from 31 equal.  I found it rather &quot;beaty&quot; for some reason.</p><p>By the way... the scale step is more than 77 cents.  Is there just a<br/>&quot;regular&quot; 19-tET scale in Scala??  I&apos;m not seeing the file.  The scale<br/>step would be around 63, yes?? Or is that just easy to get using the<br/>commands??</p><p>The third example is a 7-limit 19 tone scale.  In Scala &quot;ji_19a.scl.&quot;<br/>It seems more like our favorite forgery above...</p><p>The final example is 19 tone extracted from 1/4 comma mean-tone.  I<br/>really liked the &quot;clarity&quot; of this one...  Do I mean no beating?  Maybe.</p><p>The point behind having other people listen is that it is impossible in<br/>words to convey some of this stuff and, also, some of you &quot;guys/gl&apos;s&quot;<br/>have more experience listening in detail to these tunings than I do.</p><p>So, I will be especially intrigued to hear any comments.</p><p>The web page is at:</p><p><a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/josephpehrson/tuning.html">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/josephpehrson/tuning.html</a></p><p>I don&apos;t know how to do &quot;streaming mp3&apos;s&quot;  Anybody know??  Sorry. In the<br/>meantime you will have to wait, unfortunately, for the download to play<br/>them.</p><p>Thanks for the help!!!</p><p>_____________ _______ _____ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=10278 href="#10278">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2000 8:11:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph, that&apos;s a great experiment!  Also, it&apos;s a great example of small<br/>mistunings causing a significant affect on the &quot;mood&quot; of a piece.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
