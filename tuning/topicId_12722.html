Instead of a Farey series, the set<br/>of ratios is just those within the N-(odd)-limit. Mediants do not obey<br/>octave-equivalence (e.g.: the mediant of 4/3 and 7/5 is 11/8; the mediant of<br/>3/2 and 10/7 is 13/9; but the inversion of 13/9 is 18/13, not 11/8). So I<br/>thought of an octave-equivalent analogue of mediant -- a limit-weighted<br/>midpoint. For example, the limit-weighted midpoint of 4/3 and 7/5 would be</p><p>(3*498.04 + 7*582.51)/(3+7) = 557.17</p><p>which, as expected, is between 11/8 (551.32) and 18/13 (563.38).</p><p>I tried s=0.6% (the &quot;best case&quot; scenario) and N=167.

The other local minima<br/>are at considerably higher entropy values, though the pattern begins to fall<br/>apart, due to the finite auditory resolution represented by the s=0.6%<br/>parameter. The consistency through the 7-limit is remarkable. Qualitatively,<br/>this is an impressive validation of Partch&apos;s one-footed bride concept,<br/>though the details are tweakable in various ways. I believe that the minima<br/>marked &quot;?&quot; (15/8 and 16/15 in the graph) are artifacts of the choice N=167<br/>and should disappear when I try N=223 (next post).</p></div><h3><a id=12762 href="#12762">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/14/2000 8:22:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Paul E:]<br/>&gt;I finally got around to coding this up.

John<br/>&gt;deLaubenfels would like this curve since it repeats exactly at the<br/>&gt;octave (not shown) and the 9/7 is  more dissonant than the ET major<br/>&gt;second or tritone, while the 11/9 is less dissonant than the ET major<br/>&gt;second or tritone.</p><p>Yes, that DOES match better with what my ears would consider a good<br/>ranking.
