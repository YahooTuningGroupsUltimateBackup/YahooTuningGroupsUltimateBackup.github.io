Then they are easy for anyone to find at any time, and to comment<br/>on them, or see what stage they are at.</p><p>Reason for suggesting this is that drafts posted to the TL can easily get<br/>lost because of the large number of messages, while if placed in the tree,<br/>with the system of folders etc, will be much easier for anyone to find.</p><p>One may also be reluctant to keep posting a large faq to the TL each time one<br/>chagnes it, while if it is in the working draft tree, everyone can see it,<br/>and one just needs to say it has changed, and say what has changed.</p><p>The working draft tree is immediately up to date. Could save on<br/>a lot of posting of multiple drafts to the TL, especially later, if this really<br/>takes off and there is a lot of activity of that sort going on.</p><p>At the moment there are few enough drafts so that it is feasible to keep<br/>re-posting them, but even then, if one wants to see the latest draft<br/>on some topic, and has missed the day it was actually posted, could<br/>take some searching to find it.</p><p>Also, one might plan quite a large addition to the faq with a number of<br/>entries in it interlinked, and in that case, one could just post a note to<br/>say it has been added to the faq tree for evryone to comment on. Maybe add<br/>a new folder to the tree (say on periodicity blocks, or whatever), and all<br/>the entries are in that folder.</p><p>I think also that the FAQ tree might be a way of making some of the interesting<br/>posts to the TL from the past more easily available, perhaps edited to be<br/>up to date by the original authors.</p><p>In that way it would be going beyond the idea of a newbies faq to<br/>a kind of research resource, and a way of making some of the material<br/>from the TL more accessible, not just to newbies, but to everyone.</p><p>One could then edit it to make a faq geared towards newbies,<br/>which would be one of the roles of the FAQ keeper of course.</p><p>With my latest version of the program, it will also be possible to<br/>edit it to make a custom faq with just the sections in it that<br/>someone is particularly interested in, which they could then print<br/>out.</p><p>It is just a suggestion, and one is welcome to use the trees<br/>in whatever way one wants.</p><p>However, wanted to make sure the idea is clearly understood at any rate,<br/>then one can decide whether this is the best way to use the trees,<br/>or if some other approach is preferable.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve expressed it clearly before, but hopefully this<br/>does that now.</p><p>Rpobert</p></div>
