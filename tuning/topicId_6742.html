I really<br/>like Kraig&apos;s music, and I guess that his credo works well for him. When I<br/>write music, something just comes to me at once and I write it down or<br/>record a sketch that helps me recreate the whole later on. Sometimes I<br/>just hear a piece for years before I write something down. I never set out<br/>to write something specific because I am not an &quot;active&quot; composer. But I<br/>am an active player, and I played jazz professionally for many years.<br/>&#x9;The most gratifying and exciting musical experiences of my life<br/>have been either playing free form music that magically came together in a<br/>structured and engaged co-creativity between me and other musicians, or<br/>in taking huge liberties with a piece of music and having it coalesce into<br/>something entirely other than the piece we set out to play. I have a<br/>feeling that most jazz composers do not feel that players are dishonoring<br/>their intentions when wild improvisation takes a piece to a new place.<br/>That is the nature of the beast.<br/>&#x9;On the other hand, if I am recording a pop song and I have a<br/>strong idea of how it should be played, and I am the group leader, I make<br/>damn sure that the parts I have in mind are executed to the best of<br/>the player&apos;s ability. However, if someone picks up one of my pieces and<br/>gives it a different twist, I am seldom insulted.<br/>&#x9;I _can_ see, however, how a composer could write a piece that is<br/>to be played exactly one way, from which any deviation is completely<br/>inappropriate. Certainly there are pieces whose inner logic _demands_<br/>strict adherence to the directions of the composer. But I don&apos;t write that<br/>way, and neither does most of the musical world. Most music in the world<br/>accepts, to a greater or lesser degree, interpretation by the performer.<br/>It is a flexible and living thing, and different cultures and traditions<br/>have different ways of dealing with performance. There are many ways of<br/>making music, and I think the discounting of musical experimentation on<br/>the pieces of others is an unfortunate myopia.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/7/1999 10:11:41 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John !<br/>    I pretty much write the same way as you and I might borrow or rearrange<br/>something of my own works in a dozens of  ways, its just I am entitled to that<br/>freedom with the  things given me, no one else. I actually have one piece that<br/>can be played in any 12 tone constant structure. Lou harrison is the best<br/>example of someone who has written pieces in his pelog but allows it to be<br/>performed in any similar pelog. If a work was created with this freedom in<br/>mind go ahead I have no objections!</p><p>John Starrett wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: John Starrett &lt;<a href="mailto:jstarret@math.cudenver.edu">jstarret@math.cudenver.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         Well, on this I guess I am of a different mind than Kraig.
