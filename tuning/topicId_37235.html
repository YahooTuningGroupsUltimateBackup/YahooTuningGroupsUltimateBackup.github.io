Which as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; always, only a viewpoint.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Mark<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; so here goes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; after much thinking about the Werntz article, and about the various<br/>&gt; statements made in it, I have come up with the following ideas:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. The article represents a viewpoint derived from a teaching method of a<br/>&gt; single composer, and in that regard, Julia represents a student of the<br/>&gt; Maneri School.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. As Julia makes clear, she is not convinced by any argument involving<br/>&gt; ratios, and instead merely goes for an equal tempered scale. Yes she chooses<br/>&gt; 72EDO but she does say that others can be used. My only gripe is that 72EDO<br/>&gt; is well known for its ability to approximate quite a number of JI ratios,<br/>&gt; and so it, a bit like 12EDO, has a tendency towards random consonance - if<br/>&gt; we make the Schoenbergian attitude to the &apos;emancipation of the ratio&apos;. (I<br/>&gt; like that phrase - the emanciaption of the ratio)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. Julia&apos;s style is borrowed from her teachers. This is no bad thing, but<br/>&gt; Julia has confused it with an overall technique.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. The example given of the same interval in 12EDO being perceived<br/>&gt; differently, is simply the ascending harmonic minor scale, which contains an<br/>&gt; augmented second Aflat to B, which is the same size as the intervals G# to<br/>&gt; B. Julia states one is consonant, the other dissonant. My gripe with this is<br/>&gt; that in one (Aflat B) context, we hear it in relation to a C tonic, and in<br/>&gt; the other, to some other tonic (say E for E major), The two tones are the<br/>&gt; same interval, but given their tonal context, then the perception changes.<br/>&gt; However, that the interval is the same size has permitted composers<br/>&gt; (especially of piano music) to use the equivalences to intersect between<br/>&gt; tonalities. How else would the diminished 7th have gained its popularity in<br/>&gt; the tonal literature if the augmented second could not also be reinterpreted<br/>&gt; as a minor third?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5. I could hear the 12th tone alterations of pitch in the example she gave<br/>&gt; in her article. I heard the lowered tones as odd, not different tones,<br/>&gt; though. A 1/12th tone is only 17cents wide, near enough, and this is smaller<br/>&gt; than the diatonic commas (pythagorean, didymean, etc), and so the ear is<br/>&gt; likely to make the 1/12 tone commatic in nature - this interval represents,<br/>&gt; given the musical surroundings of a diatonic context, a qualitative change<br/>&gt; in the tone. If, on the other hand, the context involved smaller intervals,<br/>&gt; then the 1/12 would show up more readily. My gripe with Julia is that she<br/>&gt; assumes that the context can /only/ contain really small intervals. My<br/>&gt; feeling is that the context can contain large and small intervals, but that<br/>&gt; small intervals are as likely as the larger (which is obvioulsy not the case<br/>&gt; for 7-tone diatonic music).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The example in her article was (upper case for rising, lower case for<br/>&gt; falling):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A f G d E F- C bflat e d- E c- A, where - is flatten by 1/12 of a tone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6. My comment about the clarity of hearing JI dissonance is that say 10/7 or<br/>&gt; similar, may be approximated to EDO intervals, but that the actual 10/7 is<br/>&gt; in a way a purer dissonance. I have tried many of these out on my zither<br/>&gt; (useful for such comparisons), and feel that the roughness of a small number<br/>&gt; JI dissonance is often more beautiful than its close EDO counterpart. It is<br/>&gt; still a dissonance, but one whose beating elicits a distinctly powerful<br/>&gt; &apos;tonal&apos; sensation. 10/7 has a difference tone at 3/1, which is the<br/>&gt; &apos;dominant&apos; of 1/1. It is this reinforcement (questions relating to<br/>&gt; difference tones aside), which I often hear, and which is missing when EDO<br/>&gt; equivalents are used. JI music does not banish dissonance, but it does<br/>&gt; banish ugliness, in a sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After criticising the Werntz article I felt that I ought to make a personal<br/>&gt; statement about what I believe in. Some of it has already appeared in PNM,<br/>&gt; but, in essence, I believe that:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; within the infinite complexity of the universe of ratios, there are<br/>&gt; structures, or shapes, whose properties and nature give rise to a coherent<br/>&gt; use of the pitch materials they are formed from.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I call this coherent use &apos;tonality&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And - this is my personal belief - that the structures that are proposed in<br/>&gt; my article, and hopefully in a larger work about to be undertaken,  are<br/>&gt; examples of this &apos;tonality&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mark<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=37238 href="#37238">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/5/2002 7:04:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_37235.html#37235">/tuning/topicId_37235.html#37235</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; After criticising the Werntz article I felt that I ought to make<br/>a personal<br/>&gt; &gt; statement about what I believe in.

The article represents a viewpoint derived from a teaching<br/>method of a<br/>&gt; &gt; single composer, and in that regard, Julia represents a student of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; Maneri School.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. As Julia makes clear, she is not convinced by any argument<br/>involving<br/>&gt; &gt; ratios, and instead merely goes for an equal tempered scale. Yes<br/>she chooses<br/>&gt; &gt; 72EDO but she does say that others can be used. My only gripe is<br/>that 72EDO<br/>&gt; &gt; is well known for its ability to approximate quite a number of JI<br/>ratios,<br/>&gt; &gt; and so it, a bit like 12EDO, has a tendency towards random<br/>consonance - if<br/>&gt; &gt; we make the Schoenbergian attitude to the &apos;emancipation of the<br/>ratio&apos;. (I<br/>&gt; &gt; like that phrase - the emanciaption of the ratio)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 3. Julia&apos;s style is borrowed from her teachers. This is no bad<br/>thing, but<br/>&gt; &gt; Julia has confused it with an overall technique.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 4. The example given of the same interval in 12EDO being perceived<br/>&gt; &gt; differently, is simply the ascending harmonic minor scale, which<br/>contains an<br/>&gt; &gt; augmented second Aflat to B, which is the same size as the<br/>intervals G# to<br/>&gt; &gt; B. Julia states one is consonant, the other dissonant. My gripe<br/>with this is<br/>&gt; &gt; that in one (Aflat B) context, we hear it in relation to a C<br/>tonic, and in<br/>&gt; &gt; the other, to some other tonic (say E for E major), The two tones<br/>are the<br/>&gt; &gt; same interval, but given their tonal context, then the perception<br/>changes.<br/>&gt; &gt; However, that the interval is the same size has permitted<br/>composers<br/>&gt; &gt; (especially of piano music) to use the equivalences to intersect<br/>between<br/>&gt; &gt; tonalities. How else would the diminished 7th have gained its<br/>popularity in<br/>&gt; &gt; the tonal literature if the augmented second could not also be<br/>reinterpreted<br/>&gt; &gt; as a minor third?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 5. I could hear the 12th tone alterations of pitch in the example<br/>she gave<br/>&gt; &gt; in her article. I heard the lowered tones as odd, not different<br/>tones,<br/>&gt; &gt; though. A 1/12th tone is only 17cents wide, near enough, and this<br/>is smaller<br/>&gt; &gt; than the diatonic commas (pythagorean, didymean, etc), and so the<br/>ear is<br/>&gt; &gt; likely to make the 1/12 tone commatic in nature - this interval<br/>represents,<br/>&gt; &gt; given the musical surroundings of a diatonic context, a<br/>qualitative change<br/>&gt; &gt; in the tone. If, on the other hand, the context involved smaller<br/>intervals,<br/>&gt; &gt; then the 1/12 would show up more readily. My gripe with Julia is<br/>that she<br/>&gt; &gt; assumes that the context can /only/ contain really small<br/>intervals. My<br/>&gt; &gt; feeling is that the context can contain large and small intervals,<br/>but that<br/>&gt; &gt; small intervals are as likely as the larger (which is obvioulsy<br/>not the case<br/>&gt; &gt; for 7-tone diatonic music).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The example in her article was (upper case for rising, lower case<br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; falling):<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A f G d E F- C bflat e d- E c- A, where - is flatten by 1/12 of a<br/>tone.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 6. My comment about the clarity of hearing JI dissonance is that<br/>say 10/7 or<br/>&gt; &gt; similar, may be approximated to EDO intervals, but that the actual<br/>10/7 is<br/>&gt; &gt; in a way a purer dissonance. I have tried many of these out on my<br/>zither<br/>&gt; &gt; (useful for such comparisons), and feel that the roughness of a<br/>small number<br/>&gt; &gt; JI dissonance is often more beautiful than its close EDO<br/>counterpart. It is<br/>&gt; &gt; still a dissonance, but one whose beating elicits a distinctly<br/>powerful<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;tonal&apos; sensation. 10/7 has a difference tone at 3/1, which is the<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;dominant&apos; of 1/1. It is this reinforcement (questions relating to<br/>&gt; &gt; difference tones aside), which I often hear, and which is missing<br/>when EDO<br/>&gt; &gt; equivalents are used. JI music does not banish dissonance, but it<br/>does<br/>&gt; &gt; banish ugliness, in a sense.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; After criticising the Werntz article I felt that I ought to make a<br/>personal<br/>&gt; &gt; statement about what I believe in. Some of it has already appeared<br/>in PNM,<br/>&gt; &gt; but, in essence, I believe that:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; within the infinite complexity of the universe of ratios, there<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt; structures, or shapes, whose properties and nature give rise to a<br/>coherent<br/>&gt; &gt; use of the pitch materials they are formed from.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I call this coherent use &apos;tonality&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And - this is my personal belief - that the structures that are<br/>proposed in<br/>&gt; &gt; my article, and hopefully in a larger work about to be undertaken,<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt; examples of this &apos;tonality&apos;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mark<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

I had learned from Ives<br/>example<br/>&gt; early on that all moving parts were fair game. It&apos;s what you did<br/>with<br/>&gt; them that matters... how you put them at the service of your ideas<br/>and<br/>&gt; inspiration.</p><p>now add this truism (as i understand it) that pretty much any tuning<br/>system, placed in front of a musician with enough sensitivity,<br/>creative urge, and ability to plan and execute a complete artistic<br/>statement, will have plenty to offer, both in terms of pliability to<br/>the musician&apos;s will and in terms of inspiration of his or her<br/>faculties . . .</p><p>finally toss in the point of view (of which even ji-leaners such as<br/>joseph and myself, who might dissent from the points above, are fond)<br/>that presenting performers or students with a potentially endless<br/>morass of ever more complex ratios or cents deviations to consider<br/>will pose greater difficulties than working within an equally-<br/>tempered system, particularly one which includes the already-<br/>ingrained 12-equal system within it and expresses all other pitches<br/>in terms of a small set of easily-learned deviations therefrom . . .</p><p>and aren&apos;t you left with pretty much the same tack that werntz takes<br/>in her dissertation?</p><p>&gt; so unless your music is specifically designed to<br/>&gt; exploit this, then it&apos;s my opinion that it&apos;s an irrelevant and<br/>&gt; overblown bit of information that&apos;s all too easy to never get<br/>over...<br/>&gt; it&apos;s as if tuning mattered more than the music!</p><p>now if this doesn&apos;t express werntz&apos; point of view perfectly, i don&apos;t<br/>know what does!</p><p>&gt; then it&apos;s my opinion that it&apos;s an irrelevant and<br/>&gt; overblown bit of information that&apos;s all too easy to never get<br/>&gt;over...</p><p>ditto. so if people on this list are going to view your points of<br/>view with respect and tolerance (as well they should), why shouldn&apos;t<br/>werntz be afforded the same treatment??</p><p>(but)</p><p>my own point of view on this: &quot;unfortunately that point is right<br/>about where tuning stops and music begins...&quot; -- is true when &quot;music&quot;<br/>is dan stearns music or julia werntz music, but not necessarily when<br/>it&apos;s bob wendell music or david hykes music or david beardsley music<br/>or lamonte young music . . . and &quot;so unless your music is<br/>specifically designed to exploit this&quot; itself portends a myopic,<br/>almost solipsistic view of the creative process of ji- and near-ji-<br/>immersed artists -- it refuses to even consider the possibility that<br/>some or all of these artists were following their own truest<br/>impulses, and with a view toward the end musical result and only the<br/>end musical result, found that they *needed* to use just intonation<br/>or something very similar -- rather than the causation proceeding in<br/>the opposite direction, the tuning system decided on for a priori<br/>extramusical or &quot;merely tuning&quot; reasons and the music being crafted<br/>*around* the particular effects and limitations of the tuning system<br/>(which is what &quot;so unless your music is specifically designed to<br/>exploit this&quot; suggests) . . .</p><p>now it is certainly true that on the other side of the issue, there<br/>have been more than a few who have advocated just intonation as<br/>the &quot;one true tuning&quot; and questioned the artistic motives of those<br/>creating music that does not conform to some presumed<br/>overarching &quot;just intonation philosophy&quot; . . .</p><p>so, what it seems to me both the stearns/werntz camp, and the<br/>unconditional &quot;just intonation is the best intonation&quot; camp, need to<br/>appreciate, is that no matter how little musical enjoyment or<br/>fulfillment or inspiration or enlightenment or entertainment or<br/>feeling one derives from listening to the music of the other camp,<br/>there is actually a *living breathing intelligent human being* behind<br/>that music, who has had such a keen ear and profound creative spark<br/>within her or him that she or he has been willing to eschew the<br/>tuning system of her or his own culture and all the benefits that<br/>conformity to it conveys, and dedicated years, if not a lifetime, to<br/>the pursuit of art for its own sake and for the benefits it extends<br/>to the human spirit.</p><p>it&apos;s all too easy to ascribe universal significance to the result of<br/>profound aesthetic experimentation and results on the part of one&apos;s<br/>teachers or mentors or role models and the resulting profound<br/>aesthetic experiences and lessons and inspiration one may have<br/>derived from them. it&apos;s also too easy to observe seemingly<br/>contradictory points of view or methods in others and to therefore<br/>desire to find a way to rationalize the flaws in reasoning or<br/>artistic process that led those others to their conclusions.</p><p>this is what werntz does, and what i&apos;ve seen others on the both sides<br/>of the just intonation issue do, both here on this list and elsewhere.</p><p>        ******* philosophical digression begins here *******</p><p>unfortunately this mentality, with its seeming logical validity and<br/>(forgive me) amenability to the format of an academic dissertation,<br/>while perfectly appropriate and helpful in *truly universal* matters<br/>such as mathematics, is one that i think is perenially inappropriate<br/>and unhelpful in the arts. the music of all regions and all<br/>historical periods does not inevitably flow toward (or err when it<br/>retreats against) an ever truer oneness with the eternal music of the<br/>spheres, nor toward an increasing liberation of the totality of sonic<br/>possibilities via the abolishment of hierarchical structuring<br/>relationships or stylistic constraints.</p><p>nor are these same (well, exactly analogous) two alternatives<br/>appropriate or helpful views of human society in general, let alone<br/>any aesthetic or spiritual matters in particular. in the<br/>sociopolitical realm, both have been espoused by prominent and<br/>influential philosophers throughout the world and throughout history -<br/>- though the former can be associated roughly with the Age of Reason<br/>and &quot;Enlightened Despotism&quot;, and the latter with some particularly<br/>trendy (and largely french) philosophers of the 20th century. to gain<br/>an appreciation for why neither paradigm has merit as an evolutionary<br/>theory, neither for describing why things have happened as they have,<br/>nor for positing how things should be, let me refer the interested<br/>reader to the philosopher Ken Wilber and his books such as _Sex,<br/>Ecology, Spirituality_ (dave keenan recommends _A Brief History of<br/>Everything_ as a more digestable alternative).</p><p>i don&apos;t want to take up much more space here, so let me simply<br/>suggest that neither of the alternatives sketched above is a viable<br/>philosophy of art, since neither permits the combination of meaning<br/>and freedom that is essential for art to exist as a living cultural<br/>entity. ultimately we are richer for having had both philosophies<br/>expressed and followed through to their logical conclusion, but i<br/>feel that both have outlived their usefulness and the time is ripe<br/>for a richer and deeper understanding.</p><p>         ******* philosophical digression ends here *******</p><p>finally, i&apos;d have to agree with one point that mark gould seems to<br/>have made in response to werntz. that one, in the context of a<br/>dissertation on microtonality, should be _more_ inclusive of<br/>alternative methods and approaches than one is in one&apos;s own art. one<br/>may have no understanding of the musical reasons for such methods and<br/>no appreciation for the results acheived through them. but if one is<br/>to presume to say something about &quot;microtonality&quot; rather than<br/>simply &quot;my music&quot;, surely one can do better than to selectively<br/>cobble together an incoherent assortment of extreme tenets associated<br/>with an alternative approach, in order to justify a wholesale<br/>dismissal of said approach, thus bringing one&apos;s own approach into<br/>sharper focus and giving it an air of inevitability, as the only<br/>possibility still standing (as if there were no &quot;middle path&quot;<br/>possible -- many of you will catch on to the additional implications<br/>i hint at with this phrase ;) ).</p><p>engaging in some &quot;pure speculation&quot;, however, i suspect that this<br/>presentation may be an inevitable expression of the predicament a<br/>doctoral composition student finds oneself in when required to engage<br/>in a &quot;thesis defense&quot;. it isn&apos;t enough for one&apos;s music to speak for<br/>itself -- one must &quot;defend&quot; it intellectually. and, the more<br/>adventurous and unusual such music may be, perhaps the greater<br/>becomes the urge to &quot;justify&quot; it intellectually, even going so far as<br/>to show how the composer might reasonably consider it to be the &quot;one<br/>true path&quot; worthty of devoting one&apos;s career to, and therefore<br/>meriting an academic seal of approval. wild speculation, i admit, and<br/>perhaps very insulting to julia werntz. i apologize.</p><p>but unless julia comes back into the fray, and helps us reconcile<br/>what many of us are seemingly gleaning from her published writings<br/>with the views she expressed in her single post to this forum, this<br/>speculation is the best i can manage, and probably as far as i&apos;m<br/>willing to go on this particular topic (responding to werntz, that<br/>is). from my experience on this list, it&apos;s likely that i&apos;ve bred more<br/>misunderstanding than understanding here, and as i write fear is<br/>beginning to descend into my heart. perhaps julia is all too aware<br/>that that is often the way of this list, and feels the same<br/>trepidation, preventing her from making any further statements here.</p><p>ah well, let me conclude by wishing julia a long and successful<br/>career composing microtonal music, and expressing my joy that another<br/>musician has taken, with full seriousness, the bold step outside the<br/>comfortable world of 12-tone equal temperament!</p></div><h3><a id=37345 href="#37345">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2002 10:52:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

Let me try to briefly clarify some of my own<br/>feelings with the caveat that I, like most people I&apos;d imagine,<br/>exaggerate in the direction of my own interests.</p><p>When I first started getting interested in microtonality it was way<br/>before I had a computer, and one of the only contemporary sources of<br/>info that I had access to was David Doty&apos;s 1/1. Unfortunately, the JIN<br/>slant not only bugged me, it didn&apos;t line up with my own experiences<br/>either.</p><p>It&apos;s not that I wasn&apos;t interested in JI, that wasn&apos;t the case then and<br/>it isn&apos;t the case now. It&apos;s just that I was interested in<br/>microtonality in the broadest possible sense, and the JIN by its very<br/>name obviously was not. No crime there of course, but when someone<br/>like Partch said essentially the same stuff it was one thing--part and<br/>parcel of an extraordinary man&apos;s extraordinary accomplishments (and I<br/>understood it as such as Partch&apos;s art was so obviously about more than<br/>tuning). Yet when I&apos;d hear the same stuff coming from others, it<br/>seemed shrill and political... it lacked the clout that Partch carried<br/>by way of the totality of his accomplishments... at least that&apos;s how<br/>it struck me.</p><p>The simple fact is that the JIN was a bad fit for me, and others like<br/>myself who were looking for a more open-ended and unbiased view of<br/>alternatives to 12-tet. For others I&apos;m sure it was great, and I always<br/>respected Doty&apos;s professionalism and his commitment to both quality<br/>control and what it was that interested him--the just way or the<br/>highway!</p><p>Around this same time Brian McLaren sent me his, A Brief History Of<br/>Microtonality In The Twentieth Century, and this was much closer to<br/>what I was looking for. I didn&apos;t even need to hear any music by the<br/>endless parade of microtonalists and approaches he mentioned... just<br/>the notion that this vast &quot;invisible college&quot; of varied experimenters<br/>and dreamers were at work both now and across history on all these<br/>many different approaches was all my imagination needed--I knew what I<br/>wanted to do, and that was it!</p><p>I&apos;m big on interface, and the tools I have at my disposal always play<br/>a part in what I do... I&apos;m not really much of one for platonic truths.<br/>But I&apos;m even bigger on surprising myself... on making music that keeps<br/>my attention and fills me up the way I want... and I learned early on<br/>that tuning matters and it doesn&apos;t matter.

I had learned from Ives<br/>&gt; example<br/>&gt; &gt; early on that all moving parts were fair game. It&apos;s what you did<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; them that matters... how you put them at the service of your ideas<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; inspiration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; now add this truism (as i understand it) that pretty much any tuning<br/>&gt; system, placed in front of a musician with enough sensitivity,<br/>&gt; creative urge, and ability to plan and execute a complete artistic<br/>&gt; statement, will have plenty to offer, both in terms of pliability to<br/>&gt; the musician&apos;s will and in terms of inspiration of his or her<br/>&gt; faculties . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; finally toss in the point of view (of which even ji-leaners such as<br/>&gt; joseph and myself, who might dissent from the points above, are<br/>fond)<br/>&gt; that presenting performers or students with a potentially endless<br/>&gt; morass of ever more complex ratios or cents deviations to consider<br/>&gt; will pose greater difficulties than working within an equally-<br/>&gt; tempered system, particularly one which includes the already-<br/>&gt; ingrained 12-equal system within it and expresses all other pitches<br/>&gt; in terms of a small set of easily-learned deviations therefrom . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and aren&apos;t you left with pretty much the same tack that werntz takes<br/>&gt; in her dissertation?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; so unless your music is specifically designed to<br/>&gt; &gt; exploit this, then it&apos;s my opinion that it&apos;s an irrelevant and<br/>&gt; &gt; overblown bit of information that&apos;s all too easy to never get<br/>&gt; over...<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s as if tuning mattered more than the music!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; now if this doesn&apos;t express werntz&apos; point of view perfectly, i don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know what does!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; then it&apos;s my opinion that it&apos;s an irrelevant and<br/>&gt; &gt; overblown bit of information that&apos;s all too easy to never get<br/>&gt; &gt;over...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ditto. so if people on this list are going to view your points of<br/>&gt; view with respect and tolerance (as well they should), why shouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; werntz be afforded the same treatment??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (but)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; my own point of view on this: &quot;unfortunately that point is right<br/>&gt; about where tuning stops and music begins...&quot; -- is true when<br/>&quot;music&quot;<br/>&gt; is dan stearns music or julia werntz music, but not necessarily when<br/>&gt; it&apos;s bob wendell music or david hykes music or david beardsley music<br/>&gt; or lamonte young music . . . and &quot;so unless your music is<br/>&gt; specifically designed to exploit this&quot; itself portends a myopic,<br/>&gt; almost solipsistic view of the creative process of ji- and near-ji-<br/>&gt; immersed artists -- it refuses to even consider the possibility that<br/>&gt; some or all of these artists were following their own truest<br/>&gt; impulses, and with a view toward the end musical result and only the<br/>&gt; end musical result, found that they *needed* to use just intonation<br/>&gt; or something very similar -- rather than the causation proceeding in<br/>&gt; the opposite direction, the tuning system decided on for a priori<br/>&gt; extramusical or &quot;merely tuning&quot; reasons and the music being crafted<br/>&gt; *around* the particular effects and limitations of the tuning system<br/>&gt; (which is what &quot;so unless your music is specifically designed to<br/>&gt; exploit this&quot; suggests) . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; now it is certainly true that on the other side of the issue, there<br/>&gt; have been more than a few who have advocated just intonation as<br/>&gt; the &quot;one true tuning&quot; and questioned the artistic motives of those<br/>&gt; creating music that does not conform to some presumed<br/>&gt; overarching &quot;just intonation philosophy&quot; . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; so, what it seems to me both the stearns/werntz camp, and the<br/>&gt; unconditional &quot;just intonation is the best intonation&quot; camp, need to<br/>&gt; appreciate, is that no matter how little musical enjoyment or<br/>&gt; fulfillment or inspiration or enlightenment or entertainment or<br/>&gt; feeling one derives from listening to the music of the other camp,<br/>&gt; there is actually a *living breathing intelligent human being*<br/>behind<br/>&gt; that music, who has had such a keen ear and profound creative spark<br/>&gt; within her or him that she or he has been willing to eschew the<br/>&gt; tuning system of her or his own culture and all the benefits that<br/>&gt; conformity to it conveys, and dedicated years, if not a lifetime, to<br/>&gt; the pursuit of art for its own sake and for the benefits it extends<br/>&gt; to the human spirit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it&apos;s all too easy to ascribe universal significance to the result of<br/>&gt; profound aesthetic experimentation and results on the part of one&apos;s<br/>&gt; teachers or mentors or role models and the resulting profound<br/>&gt; aesthetic experiences and lessons and inspiration one may have<br/>&gt; derived from them. it&apos;s also too easy to observe seemingly<br/>&gt; contradictory points of view or methods in others and to therefore<br/>&gt; desire to find a way to rationalize the flaws in reasoning or<br/>&gt; artistic process that led those others to their conclusions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this is what werntz does, and what i&apos;ve seen others on the both<br/>sides<br/>&gt; of the just intonation issue do, both here on this list and<br/>elsewhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;         ******* philosophical digression begins here *******<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; unfortunately this mentality, with its seeming logical validity and<br/>&gt; (forgive me) amenability to the format of an academic dissertation,<br/>&gt; while perfectly appropriate and helpful in *truly universal* matters<br/>&gt; such as mathematics, is one that i think is perenially inappropriate<br/>&gt; and unhelpful in the arts. the music of all regions and all<br/>&gt; historical periods does not inevitably flow toward (or err when it<br/>&gt; retreats against) an ever truer oneness with the eternal music of<br/>the<br/>&gt; spheres, nor toward an increasing liberation of the totality of<br/>sonic<br/>&gt; possibilities via the abolishment of hierarchical structuring<br/>&gt; relationships or stylistic constraints.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; nor are these same (well, exactly analogous) two alternatives<br/>&gt; appropriate or helpful views of human society in general, let alone<br/>&gt; any aesthetic or spiritual matters in particular. in the<br/>&gt; sociopolitical realm, both have been espoused by prominent and<br/>&gt; influential philosophers throughout the world and throughout<br/>history -<br/>&gt; - though the former can be associated roughly with the Age of Reason<br/>&gt; and &quot;Enlightened Despotism&quot;, and the latter with some particularly<br/>&gt; trendy (and largely french) philosophers of the 20th century. to<br/>gain<br/>&gt; an appreciation for why neither paradigm has merit as an<br/>evolutionary<br/>&gt; theory, neither for describing why things have happened as they<br/>have,<br/>&gt; nor for positing how things should be, let me refer the interested<br/>&gt; reader to the philosopher Ken Wilber and his books such as _Sex,<br/>&gt; Ecology, Spirituality_ (dave keenan recommends _A Brief History of<br/>&gt; Everything_ as a more digestable alternative).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i don&apos;t want to take up much more space here, so let me simply<br/>&gt; suggest that neither of the alternatives sketched above is a viable<br/>&gt; philosophy of art, since neither permits the combination of meaning<br/>&gt; and freedom that is essential for art to exist as a living cultural<br/>&gt; entity. ultimately we are richer for having had both philosophies<br/>&gt; expressed and followed through to their logical conclusion, but i<br/>&gt; feel that both have outlived their usefulness and the time is ripe<br/>&gt; for a richer and deeper understanding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          ******* philosophical digression ends here *******<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; finally, i&apos;d have to agree with one point that mark gould seems to<br/>&gt; have made in response to werntz. that one, in the context of a<br/>&gt; dissertation on microtonality, should be _more_ inclusive of<br/>&gt; alternative methods and approaches than one is in one&apos;s own art. one<br/>&gt; may have no understanding of the musical reasons for such methods<br/>and<br/>&gt; no appreciation for the results acheived through them. but if one is<br/>&gt; to presume to say something about &quot;microtonality&quot; rather than<br/>&gt; simply &quot;my music&quot;, surely one can do better than to selectively<br/>&gt; cobble together an incoherent assortment of extreme tenets<br/>associated<br/>&gt; with an alternative approach, in order to justify a wholesale<br/>&gt; dismissal of said approach, thus bringing one&apos;s own approach into<br/>&gt; sharper focus and giving it an air of inevitability, as the only<br/>&gt; possibility still standing (as if there were no &quot;middle path&quot;<br/>&gt; possible -- many of you will catch on to the additional implications<br/>&gt; i hint at with this phrase ;) ).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; engaging in some &quot;pure speculation&quot;, however, i suspect that this<br/>&gt; presentation may be an inevitable expression of the predicament a<br/>&gt; doctoral composition student finds oneself in when required to<br/>engage<br/>&gt; in a &quot;thesis defense&quot;. it isn&apos;t enough for one&apos;s music to speak for<br/>&gt; itself -- one must &quot;defend&quot; it intellectually. and, the more<br/>&gt; adventurous and unusual such music may be, perhaps the greater<br/>&gt; becomes the urge to &quot;justify&quot; it intellectually, even going so far<br/>as<br/>&gt; to show how the composer might reasonably consider it to be the &quot;one<br/>&gt; true path&quot; worthty of devoting one&apos;s career to, and therefore<br/>&gt; meriting an academic seal of approval. wild speculation, i admit,<br/>and<br/>&gt; perhaps very insulting to julia werntz. i apologize.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but unless julia comes back into the fray, and helps us reconcile<br/>&gt; what many of us are seemingly gleaning from her published writings<br/>&gt; with the views she expressed in her single post to this forum, this<br/>&gt; speculation is the best i can manage, and probably as far as i&apos;m<br/>&gt; willing to go on this particular topic (responding to werntz, that<br/>&gt; is). from my experience on this list, it&apos;s likely that i&apos;ve bred<br/>more<br/>&gt; misunderstanding than understanding here, and as i write fear is<br/>&gt; beginning to descend into my heart. perhaps julia is all too aware<br/>&gt; that that is often the way of this list, and feels the same<br/>&gt; trepidation, preventing her from making any further statements here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ah well, let me conclude by wishing julia a long and successful<br/>&gt; career composing microtonal music, and expressing my joy that<br/>another<br/>&gt; musician has taken, with full seriousness, the bold step outside the<br/>&gt; comfortable world of 12-tone equal temperament!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

Possibly that could contribute to<br/>&gt; its &quot;aggressive&quot; sound that people keep talking about??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JP</p><p>If you like dominant seventh chords, the seventh in both temperaments<br/>are sharp, quite sharp in 19t-ET. When you think about it, JI M3s are<br/>narrow relative to 12-EDO, and 1/4-comma splits them in two equal<br/>parts for the M2s. Since the major thirds are seven cents flat in 19<br/>EDO the seconds are quite flat, which raises the sevenths, of course.</p><p>I find them a bit gritty even in 31. I&apos;m talking sharp in terms of<br/>normal 9:16 just sevenths and not the 4:7 or septimal seventh. In 31<br/>you have a very pure septimal seventh, only one cent flat, but they<br/>don&apos;t always sound &quot;right&quot; in seventh chords, depending on context,<br/>and if your tuning is even a little off, some keys will make them<br/>flatter. Flat septimal sevenths do NOT sound good to many people&apos;s<br/>ears these days.</p><p>If you want to talk subjective experience, I really like 1/4-comma<br/>meantone or its equivalent, 31t-ET. I recently tuned a nice 21-chord<br/>autoharp in 1/4-comma and it sounds wonderfully pure. If you tune it<br/>from two flats to three sharps, only two of the 21 chords are<br/>unusable (AbM and B7, because the Ab is really G# and the D# is<br/>really Eb).</p><p>The nineteen good chords is more than a lot of autoharps have and<br/>they sound so good it makes no sense to me to tune an autoharp in 12t-<br/>ET. I&apos;m thinking it would be great if schools tuned them this way to<br/>train kids ears to hear purer harmonies. Fifths that are five cents<br/>flat is a small price to pay for eliminating major thirds that are 14<br/>cents sharp! The slightly flat fifths give the chords a<br/>pleasant &quot;vibrato&quot; with their slow beats. Where you pay the piper is<br/>either in the restrictions in modulation or the number of pitches<br/>needed per octave.</p><p>In the case of the autoharp, the sacrifice is negligible. Very few of<br/>the songs they&apos;re used for ever use the two bad chords. I&apos;m actually<br/>considering doing some simple, minimalist composition of vocal songs<br/>with autoharp tuned in 1/4-comma. I&apos;m kind of attracted to the idea<br/>of playing creatively in a modern idiom within such narrow<br/>constraints. Could be a good exercise.</p><p>By the way, there&apos;s a neat trick I&apos;ve discovered and use to great<br/>advantage in finding the D between C and E to set the temperament for<br/>1/4-comma. This trick is possible because C# and G# are very close to<br/>JI septimal sevenths above Eb and Bb respectively. After tuning the E<br/>a pure M3 above C, tune a G# another pure M3 above the E. Then find<br/>the Bb and D that form with the G# a pure septimal seventh chord<br/>minus the fifth. This will yield theoretically a D that is only one<br/>cent flat to the theoretically perfect pitch for the D. You already<br/>have a good Bb and G# already as well.</p><p>If you can aurally set the D that accurately any other way, thumbs<br/>up, but this is an extremely accurate cross-check. I personally do<br/>the septimal seventh first, then check the D against the C and E for<br/>equal tuning dissonance and recycle if necessary. I then tune the G<br/>to equalize the tuning dissonance between C and D, then likewise the<br/>A with E and D.</p><p>You can then use the septical seventh trick to check the C# against<br/>Eb and G as well as for a pure M3 above the A. The huge advantage<br/>this provides is that you get an accurate cross-check without timing<br/>beats on pitches that are relatively remote harmonically and<br/>therefore subject to small but cumulative tuning errors. This is<br/>especially important on strings that are not terribly true, such as<br/>is typical in autoharps, for example.</p><p>Well, we digressed a bit, but it&apos;s not completely irrelevant. (Or is<br/>it completely my elephant? Groan!)</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3><a id=37652 href="#37652">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2002 5:24:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul,</p><p>Thanks for a wonderful post.

the degree to which a set of frequencies are in<br/>a harmonic relationship is the degree to which we&apos;ll hear the<br/>sensation as a *single pitch* (which can be quite clear even if the<br/>fundamental frequency is physically absent). thus the clear and<br/>coherent tone of the human voice, the bowed string, the reed or brass<br/>instrument. this same phenomenon also imbues our perception of<br/>combinations of pitches with a certain &quot;gestalt&quot; of the same kind --<br/>for example, a diminished triad (particularly if the lower minor<br/>third is augmented by a twelfth-tone and the upper minor third is<br/>diminished by a sixth-tone) evokes the sound of a seventh chord with<br/>a missing root. the degree to which this &quot;root&quot; is clearly defined<br/>(and actually having it played by a bass instrument helps too) is<br/>certainly a component in the perceived concordance of a chord. these<br/>effects are of great importance to harmony.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m<br/>&gt; curious which of my main points in that section you think might be<br/>altered if I read<br/>&gt; it.</p><p>this is difficult to answer because i wonder what you even did read<br/>to arrive at the points in that section. what theorists who discussed<br/>just intonation did you consult? benedetti? zarlino? the list goes<br/>on . . . you cite helmholtz and partch, but how much of helmholtz&apos;s<br/>book did you read? your dissertation misrepresents the technicalities<br/>of partch&apos;s system, your paper says that johnston&apos;s piano sonata uses<br/>two or more conflicting just tunings while in fact it&apos;s tuned to a<br/>single 81-tone chunk of the lattice. in nearly every case your<br/>statements in this section seem to come out of a shallow survey of<br/>the theory and practice of just intonation and related models.</p><p>but the point here is that you focus on beating, and beating is but a<br/>small piece of the puzzle. combinational tones are yet another piece<br/>that we haven&apos;t even brought up yet in this discussion.</p><p>&gt; Also I&apos;m curious why you say my discussion of beating is narrow and<br/>&gt; inconsistent.</p><p>i can tune a 17:13, or *any* interval that is a ratio of smaller<br/>numbers than these, by ear by eliminating beats between the<br/>appropriate pair of partials (which is not too difficult if you know<br/>the interval is about 464 cents). of course, other pairs of partials<br/>will still beat against one another. but, for a typical timbre, this<br/>is even true of 5:4, more so than of 4:3 (despite what you claim in<br/>your paper). take another look of helmholtz. and what about 5:3<br/>(which would fall somewhere in between the two in beatyness) or 6:5?<br/>you say that the only intervals just intonation theory would consider<br/>truly consonant are 2:1, 3:2, 5:4, and maybe 7:4. but this wouldn&apos;t<br/>even allow you to construct a consonant triad, since either a major<br/>or minor triad, while containing a 3:2 and a 5:4, must also contain a<br/>6:5.</p><p>again, what sources did you consult?

And if one hoped for me to delve into the particulars<br/>of just intonation and its cousins, one had the wrong expectations of this essay and<br/>would certainly be disappointed. However, my conception of the basic premise of<br/>contemporary pure tuning trends is wholly intact so far (and has been in fact<br/>reaffirmed by my visits to the Tuning List), and was initially formed through a<br/>study of the writings of many of the leading practitioners that was anything but<br/>shallow.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; but the point here is that you focus on beating, and beating is but a<br/>&gt; small piece of the puzzle.</p><p>I realize that beating is only one of the issues.

President?) of the Just Intonation Network, I think he can be considered<br/>one important and influential spokesperson for the movement. Of course, Kyle<br/>Gann also gives *great* importance to beating as evidence of the flaw of equal<br/>temperament in his essay on JI on his site.

What you said there seemed to<br/>support that point.</p><p>firstly, i&apos;ll just note that the interval 7:6, which you seem to like<br/>in your paper, clearly falls into the category of intervals referred<br/>to above.</p><p>now, let me address this:</p><p>&quot;beating frequently being cited as evidence of the flaws in 12-note<br/>ET&quot;</p><p>well, i think it&apos;s more like this -- one of the most straightforward<br/>(and hence perhaps too-frequently cited) audible demonstrations of<br/>the difference in sound between equal temperament and just intonation<br/>is to play some of these basic, ultra-consonant intervals and compare<br/>them. i believe even isacoff does this on his webpage. you can<br/>immediately hear (actually, i know some great musicians who can&apos;t)<br/>that at least *some* of the beating present in the equal temperament<br/>chord disappears entirely in the just intonation version.</p><p>now, the thing is, *exactly* the same effect happens (but slightly<br/>diminished in prominence) in the case of the minor sixth --<br/>especially the 8:5 minor sixth, but even, under ideal listening<br/>conditions, the 13:8 and 14:9 minor sixths. you&apos;ll hear that certain<br/>beating overtones in the equal-tempered minor sixth simply cease to<br/>beat in the just intonation version. the tuning is &quot;smoothed-out&quot; --<br/>as far as reducing roughness is concerned, the 8:5 tuning is optimal<br/>within the range of &quot;minor sixths&quot;, within the range of intervals<br/>that serve that &quot;particular musical function&quot;. sure, there may still<br/>be other overtones that beat -- but this is a necessary, unavoidable<br/>aspect of all intervals in this range.</p><p>does that mean that all &quot;minor sixths&quot; are somewhat rough? my<br/>roommate in college, who was taking music courses but had no<br/>knowledge of acoustics, tuning, ratios, etc., played the piano and<br/>asked me this question. &quot;why is this interval [plays C-F#] just as<br/>dissonant as this interval [plays C-Ab]&quot;? he was really bugged by<br/>this since he was being taught, in his music class, that these<br/>intervals fell into completely different categories: dissonant, and<br/>consonant, respectively. well, we both know the answer, julia --<br/>*context* makes the difference, and can have all kinds of influence<br/>on the perceived tension or lack thereof of any element of a musical<br/>composition. in fact the very projection of the interval *as* a minor<br/>sixth (as an interval subtending six scale degrees in the operative<br/>diatonic scale) is quite key to the &quot;consonant&quot; quality it acquires<br/>in Western music. note that &quot;augmented fifths&quot;, while the same size<br/>acoustically, sound like (and are considered) dissonances! of all our<br/>modern consonances, the minor sixth was the *last* to be accepted<br/>into the pantheon, as margo has documented.</p><p>i don&apos;t think the &quot;just intonation movement&quot; denies this &quot;context-<br/>relativity&quot; -- it&apos;s just that many of its advocates want to go back<br/>to the basic qualities of intervals and chords *themselves*, such as<br/>what my roommate was responding to, and work their way up to complete<br/>musical pieces from there. it&apos;s a &quot;rebellious&quot; movement that &quot;cuts<br/>the cord&quot; with Western musical culture, with which it is<br/>disenchanted, and looks to the study of basic musical materials as a<br/>means toward erecting a new culture. perhaps, given as many centuries<br/>to develop as european music has had, it will produce works of great<br/>power and meaning that would impress even you. maybe it won&apos;t.<br/>anyway, the 8:5 in just intonation can certainly be projected as a<br/>consonance by all sorts of &quot;contextual&quot; methods -- most<br/>straightforwardly, by contrasting it with the *still rougher*<br/>intervals that surround it or that pepper the intervallic landscape<br/>(see helmholtz&apos;s chart again or any of the more modern variations),<br/>or by implying a complete triad through successive alternation with<br/>the missing triad member, etc. . . . in other just intonation<br/>contexts, say something &quot;gothic&quot;, the 8:5 might be used as a<br/>(somewhat smooth) version of a *dissonance* -- since in the context<br/>of gothic music, *all* minor sixths (let along augmented fifths) are<br/>projected as dissonances.</p><p>what is probably more important than beating, by the way, is that all<br/>the *combinational tones* of the 8:5 minor sixth *line up*. while a<br/>minor sixth in equal temperament produces all sorts of combinational<br/>tones, including one or two still audible at low volumes, for example<br/>the minor sixth a-f&apos; will produce, in the ear, an F (complete with<br/>its own series of harmonics) that is 67 cents sharp relative to the<br/>high F! for the just intonation a-f&apos;, this F is perfectly in tune<br/>with the high F. someone who works with equal temperament all the<br/>time learns to &quot;filter out&quot; these out-of-tune combinational tones,<br/>except in extreme examples like two flutes playing high and<br/>loud . . . but if you spend some time with the sounds of just<br/>intonation, these &quot;defects&quot; (from the just intonation movement&apos;s<br/>point of view) of equal temperament will stick out like a sore thumb.<br/>helmholtz does discuss combinational tones, so you should be able to<br/>learn more about them even if you don&apos;t have anything more recent. in<br/>any case it should be clear that the idea of a &quot;just intonation minor<br/>sixth&quot; is by no means a contradiction in terms!</p><p>then there&apos;s the whole virtual pitch issue . . .</p><p>&gt; &gt; my point is that many even more consonant intervals, even major<br/>&gt; &gt; thirds in lower registers, can exhibit beating, and yet this<br/>rarely<br/>&gt; &gt; disturbs the &quot;just intonation theorist&quot; -- who instead tends to<br/>&gt; &gt; discover additional, *new* consonant intervals, as they tingle<br/>his or<br/>&gt; &gt; her palate in familiar yet unfamiliar ways.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Is it possible that you, too, are misrepresenting &quot;the just<br/>intonation theorist,&quot; as if<br/>&gt; there is one type? Granted, you know more of them than I do, but I<br/>certainly have<br/>&gt; heard beats disussed quite a bit as if they are evidence of a<br/>flawed interval, and<br/>&gt; gave you some examples in my last posts.</p><p>see above.</p><p>look, not all just intonation theorists have all their theory correct<br/>and/or consistent. in fact, i&apos;m the bane of all of them on this<br/>list :) but that&apos;s where i come in saying your response is &quot;shallow&quot;.<br/>the fact is that any just intonationist, and plenty of musically<br/>untrained experimental subjects, can hear the &quot;smoothness&quot; (defined<br/>by *relative* lack of beating, alignment of combinational tones,<br/>etc.) of the 8:5 in contradistinction to the relative &quot;roughness&quot; of<br/>other minor sixths / augmented fifths. so when a minor sixth is<br/>called for, the &quot;just intonationist&quot; tends to shoot for the 8:5<br/>(though the 13:8, 14:9, or even more complex intervals can often be<br/>more desirable depending on context).</p><p>my gut reaction was that it was exceedingly pedantic, and almost<br/>willfully distancing, to point out that the minor sixth has some<br/>beating in it, and to present that if that were some kind of &quot;show-<br/>stopper&quot; for the rest of the just intonation programme. maybe some<br/>proponent of just intonation made a statement that wasn&apos;t 100%<br/>accurate in a scientific sense, but your attempt to make a serious<br/>issue out of this in your paper led me to feel that you really must<br/>have delved only very &quot;shallowly&quot; into just intonation theory and<br/>practice. the argument reminded me, strangely enough, of some<br/>medieval proofs of the existence of god, because it so simplistic,<br/>and yet is presented in such a way as to make any alternative seem<br/>utterly absurd. yet if you felt this argument really had any weight --<br/> that is, if it were capable of convincing even one just<br/>intonationist to &quot;switch sides&quot; -- then you really must feel that the<br/>just intonation movement is based on flimsy foundations indeed. and<br/>that is why i felt insulted on its behalf.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, rather than me playing a guessing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; game, why don&apos;t you just tell me your explanation of the<br/>tension in<br/>&gt; &gt; that sort of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; augmented second, beyond the standard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; lowered-sixth-degree-and-raised-seventh-degree-needing-to-<br/>resolve<br/>&gt; &gt; type of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; explanation?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;guessing game&quot;?
