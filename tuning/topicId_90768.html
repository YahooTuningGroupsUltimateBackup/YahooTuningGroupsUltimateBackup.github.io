But the octave is a ratio most common to the &quot;strategies&quot; of many instruments, including newer synthesizer architectures. Look at their 16&apos;, 8&apos;, 4&apos; octaving borrowed from the pipe organ. Most timbres/instrument voices include a similar designation of transpositions up or down by octaves. We have octave possibilities all over the place.</p><p>So why not, as an experiment, investigate divisions which are not integer based, but allow fractional parts? That will lose all octave symmetry, but if we handle the octaving later, we might be able to find some really interesting equal-step specimens.&quot;</p><p>------------</p><p>So, the idea that you can&apos;t use octaves with the Carlos Alpha, Beta, and Gamma scales isn&apos;t quite accurate.

Any &gt;&gt; of those is reason enough to use something like Alpha without octaves.<br/>&gt; &gt; Indeed it is, and I don&apos;t object to the idea. What I do object to is<br/>&gt; presenting something like Alpha or 88cet and never even mentioning<br/>&gt; valentine or octacot, giving a completely distorted idea of the<br/>&gt; actual situation and available options.

You might not notice the slightly mistuned octaves with Gamma or Beta (you might even prefer that effect), but the octaves in Alpha are not even close to pure. So it looks like the use of Alpha without octaves is a secondary development (possibly influenced by other non-octave systems like Bohlen-Pierce and 88-cet).</p><p>On the other hand, 88-cet was a non-octave tuning from the beginning. In retrospect we can look back at it and see that it&apos;s octacot without octaves, but it was an independent development. So, unless someone discovers examples from before 1995 of what we&apos;re now calling octacot, I don&apos;t know how you can accurately describe 88cet as an offshoot of octacot.</p><p>But I don&apos;t know why it is that when someone wants to try writing music in Carlos Alpha it gets so many comments like this not about the music, but about the choice of scale used. When I tried writing something in Alpha, I got complaints that I was using octave doublings (not even in the same instrument part). So you can&apos;t win. I say you should use whatever tuning you like that gives you the sound you want for your music.</p></div><h3><a id=90845 href="#90845">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2010 12:31:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Listen to Carlos&apos; &quot;Beauty in the Beast&quot;, it&apos;s got octaves all over the<br/>&gt; place (even the melody has perfect fourths, which would be impossible<br/>&gt; without octaves in these temperaments).</p><p>Then the piece is in a rank two temperament, the one we&apos;ve been calling valentine, though maybe we should call it wendy.

She obviously did use Carlos Alpha (that&apos;s where the name is from, after all) but she used it (among other things) in a way that we might describe as a rank 2 temperament (with octaves).

But &quot;alpha&quot; is more like &quot;quarter-comma meantone&quot; or &quot;88-cet&quot;: a specific tuning. It happens that we can identify it with a rank 1 or rank 2 temperament (depending on whether octaves are used), but really it&apos;s just a scale with intervals of 78.0 cents between each note.</p><p>So asking why not use valentine instead of Carlos Alpha is roughly like asking someone who&apos;s writing music in 1/4-comma meantone why they prefer that over meantone[31]. (Except that &quot;valentine&quot; is less familiar to begin with, and you can&apos;t just assume that someone knows about it.) Or perhaps a better example: if you&apos;re writing something in Wilson&apos;s Golden Horogram Scale #17, why do you prefer that over sentinel? Maybe you just picked the scale because of its harmonic or melodic properties, not how it could be categorized as a temperament.
