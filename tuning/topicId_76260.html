This time, I decided to do the opposite -- to take the music which was originally intended for mavila and retune it to meantone. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve done with the first half of the mavila piece I posted yesterday ---  because I haven&apos;t recorded the secord half to a MIDI file. Anyway, I think the first half is enough to show the difference. While pieces retuned from meantone to mavila usually sounded cold or weird to me, I found mavila music retuned to meantone to sound either pretty &quot;naive&quot; like a nursery rhyme, either a bit like from China, or like some unexpectedly &quot;sweet and pleasant&quot; Baroque or romantic music; but never cold or unconvincing.

I use this on my hammer dulcimer and it took me quite a while to settle on where in the sequence i preferred it.  Like the ones we find in Indonesia and South east Asia ( Mavila actually is closer to Burmese tuning that Javanese) you get more different sizes steps.

One does the subharmonic by treating these numbers subharmonicly as opposed to harmonically.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>Petr Pa&rcaron;&iacute;zek wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#xFEFF;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kraig wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; While one can go for the converged or Ehrlich reduction on the idea,<br/>&gt; &gt; but there is great subtle variations that happen in the recurrent<br/>&gt; &gt; sequence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; What is that?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I use this on my hammer dulcimer and it took me quite a while<br/>&gt; &gt; to settle on where in the sequence i preferred it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; You&rsquo;ve lost me, I&rsquo;m afraid.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Like the ones we<br/>&gt; &gt; find in Indonesia and South east Asia ( Mavila actually is closer to<br/>&gt; &gt; Burmese tuning that Javanese) you get more different sizes steps.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; Still haven&rsquo;t caught on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Little explored would be the subharmonic versions. This is work better<br/>&gt; &gt; if one used this series for Pelog Lou Harrison seem to realize more and<br/>&gt; &gt; more that the subharmonic series works better because it doesn&apos;t lock in<br/>&gt; &gt; the tonality as much.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; How do I make pelog out of the subharmonic series?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mavila is closer to a 16 Et than a 9 Et and only works with certain<br/>&gt; &gt; types of Pelogs, not the classic where the small intervals are of<br/>&gt; &gt; different size.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean by &bdquo;classic pelog&ldquo;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
