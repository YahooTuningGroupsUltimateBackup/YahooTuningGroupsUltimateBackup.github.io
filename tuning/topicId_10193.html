Thanks Paul for all your help.  But, why don&apos;t you<br/>consider having Monz post this derivation as a continuation of your<br/>Entropy article...  Even if some of us don&apos;t understand it, it probably<br/>will be fun to look at... (I&apos;m being serious.)</p><p>Also, the Utonal/Otonal midi chords should eventually be linked to the<br/>Monz site... or maybe Starrett... something central where people can<br/>find them.  That is, if somebody actually does them.  I&apos;m anxious to<br/>hear them.</p><p>I would like to hear more about the Partch Utonal/Otonal vs. &quot;major,<br/>minor&quot; harmonic theory.  If I&apos;m understanding this correctly, the<br/>Utonal/Otonal is essentially ONE dimensional... actually one<br/>complementary set of ratios and while Partch may like to think of this<br/>as &quot;Major-Minor,&quot; essentially it is totally separate from traditional<br/>&quot;major minor&quot; theory of traditional &quot;functional&quot; harmony.  This is all<br/>very interesting... but I fear I should &quot;brush up&quot; on my Partch again...<br/>it&apos;s been a couple of years since I read Genesis for the first time (!!)</p><p>Also, if you have any further information on how Erv Wilson created his<br/>19 tone scale which is Scala 19-31ji.scl, I would appreciate it.  How<br/>was this scale made?... and does anybody know where I could get copies<br/>of Xenharmonicon 7 and 8 which might have the answer to this??</p><p>Whatever Erv Wilson was doing it seems to be working in a strange way.<br/>I have tried virtually ALL the 19 tone scales in Scala, and this one<br/>seems the most particularly resonant.  Of course, MANY of the ratios are<br/>quite small... this, of course, pertains only with reference to the<br/>fundamental, and other combinations of pitches would set up different<br/>complexities... but, on the whole, the entire thing seems uncannily<br/>resonant...</p><p>____________ _______ ____ ___ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
