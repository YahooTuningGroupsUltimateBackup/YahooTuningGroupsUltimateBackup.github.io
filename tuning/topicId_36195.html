In fact, it might be an interesting topic for the<br/>Sibelius users list, and I am going to post your request over there,<br/>if you don&apos;t mind.  A gentleman over there was asking for extended<br/>fonts for non-western musics as it was, and I didn&apos;t have a resource<br/>to give him.</p><p>By the way, what kind of font *is* this?  Is it a PostScript font?</p><p>In any case, there really *are* a few &quot;standards&quot; for microtonal<br/>accidentals that, I believe are starting to be recognized.</p><p>Sibelius uses the &quot;Tartini&quot; quartertones, which are the commonly<br/>recognized ones such as the &quot;backwards&quot; flat (either filled or open)<br/>and the SINGLE vertical line for a sharp with just ONE slanted line<br/>through it.  These are *very* common quartertone symbols and I was<br/>interested in finding out that these are the ones being implemented<br/>in Sibelius.</p><p>For my *own* purposes, I like using the 72-tET symbols developed by<br/>Ezra Sims and used and taught by Joe Maneri at the New England<br/>Conservatory of Music.</p><p>There is *already* a PostScript font for these symbols developed by<br/>cellist Ted Mook, and you might be interested in taking a look at it:</p><p><a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~tmook/micro.html">http://www.mindspring.com/~tmook/micro.html</a></p><p>I will write to you offlist regarding your kind offer.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=36259 href="#36259">ðŸ”—</a>ertugrulInanc &#x3C;ertugrulinanc@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/5/2002 5:44:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you very much, Joseph, for your encouragement and information.<br/>Thanks also for the link.

There is no problem getting this to work in Sibelius,<br/>since it is a simple TrueType font, which works very easily.</p><p>However, aside from a few symbols in there, many of the spaces seemed<br/>to contain only your initials &quot;EI&quot; unless I have to have *other*<br/>Persian or Arabian fonts installed to read them.

Alt + 0135 and Alt + 0137 characters are preserved with just<br/>the same precise settings with those in Pergolesi. This is planned to<br/>be continuous.</p><p>Please have a look at the &quot;Test 02.NWC&quot; file and feed the author back<br/>with suggestions, improvements, bug reports et cetera.</p><p>The font is provided as is, with no warranty. It is freeware and<br/>shall remain so. A few glyphs are imposted from Pergolesi, which will<br/>have been replaced with originals at the next release.</p><p>Copyright &copy; 2002 by Ertugrul iNAN&Ccedil;, All Rights Reserved.

Sibelius only works on a *per score* basis -- in<br/>other words, I would have to copy *this* file if I were to keep the<br/>symbols.

(A private list,<br/>unfortunately only for Sibelius purchasers).  Perhaps more people<br/>will contact you.</p><p>In fact, there was one fellow there who, specifically, wanted to know<br/>how to notate Arabic music with Sibelius, so I believe he will be<br/>*particularly* interested in this.</p><p>Now the problem I have is that I have *no idea* what the symbols<br/>mean!! aside from the obvious ones with quartertones.</p><p>Is there any way you could create a graphic file with the symbols and<br/>what they mean in *text* so we could understand them, Ertugral??</p><p>Sibelius could easily do this, but I don&apos;t know if &quot;Noteworthy<br/>Composer&quot; can handle it.</p><p>Otherwise, I&apos;m pretty much *lost* here... my understanding of Persian<br/>and Arabic music is not great, at this point.</p><p>&gt; Test2.NWC is a Noteworthy Composer<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.noteworthysoftware.com">http://www.noteworthysoftware.com</a>&gt; score which represents the<br/>&gt; positioning of the symbols with notes on a staffline or a space.<br/>&gt; (However, alignements are NOT optimised because of some future<br/>plans.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>****Unfortunately, Ertugral, Sibelius does not import and<br/>convert &quot;Noteworthy Composer&quot; files, and, frankly, I&apos;m not too<br/>interested at this moment in taking the time to try to figure out<br/>something with that program, since I&apos;m very involved with Sibelius.</p><p>&gt; Since Joseph kindly reported that the font works fine with<br/>Sibelius,<br/>&gt; I think I shall update the readme file. If Joseph or any other<br/>&gt; Sibelius user could make a .sib version of the test score, I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; include that file with the package and credit the supplier.<br/>&gt;</p><p>****So basically, Ertugral, the file I am sending you and posting on<br/>this Forum is a Sibelius file that has all the symbols included in it.</p><p>In order to make this work, though, it would seem that a person would<br/>have to have your &quot;Accidentals&quot; font installed on their computer.</p><p>That&apos;s not difficult to do, however.  All that&apos;s necessary is to move<br/>the font into the Fonts directory under Windows, obviously.
