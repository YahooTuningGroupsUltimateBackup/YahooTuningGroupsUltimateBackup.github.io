This deals with two pitches<br/>&gt; found in variant manuscript versions of two songs, &quot;An baches<br/>&gt; ranft&quot; from op. 3, and &quot;Das Lockere saatgefilde lechzet krank&quot;<br/>&gt; from the 1908-09 Four Stefan George Songs. Schweiger offers some<br/>&gt; suggestions as to the interpretation of these two pitches which<br/>&gt; are defined by the composer only as lying between two 12tet<br/>&gt; pitches. The harmonic contexts are not analyzed here in any<br/>&gt; detail, so it is unclear whether Webern had specific pitches in<br/>&gt; mind or was just seeking some particularly expressive intonation,<br/>&gt; one, as Schweiger points out, possibly related to Sprechgesang.</p><p>Since this particular subject is one that is very dear to my heart,<br/>and since last week I had the good fortune to be able to access<br/>the wonderful U. of Penn library in Philadelphia, I found not only<br/>the Schweiger article but also all but one of Schweiger&apos;s references.</p><p>I did a rough translation of it into English, and will make a<br/>webpage of it in the future, after I&apos;ve polished the translation<br/>a bit and translated the pertinent info from the other citations.</p><p>In the meantime, I&apos;ve added this info, along with the important<br/>stuff I found on Schoenberg&apos;s interest in microtonality, to my<br/>_A Century of New Music in Vienna_ webpage, which has just undergone<br/>a major update:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a></p><p>Note that it appears that Webern&apos;s notation of microtones in<br/>these sketches of 1908/09 was the apparent inspiration for<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s later invention of _sprechstimme_!</p><p>I&apos;m very happy to see that the more I work on this page, the<br/>more my two main musical interests, Mahler/Schoenberg and<br/>microtonality, are coming together!</p><p>A couple of important questions:</p><p>Can anyone point me to information on Willi von M&ouml;llendorff?<br/>His quarter-tone harmonium is what inspired Haba to go microtonal;<br/>I&apos;d love to have copies of his articles.

Don&apos;t forget that<br/>Webern&apos;s teacher Schoenberg is the guy who came up with the<br/>idea of _Klagfarbenmelodie_: a continuous shifting of timbres<br/>on more-or-less the same pitches, so that the changing overtones<br/>in the harmonic spectra of the various instruments would give<br/>a &apos;melody of tone-colors&apos;.  Schoenberg had a big argument with<br/>Mahler around 1904 about the possibility of doing this, and then<br/>he actually carried out the idea in 1909 in the third piece of<br/>his _Five Pieces for Orchestra_.</p><p>I&apos;ve speculated that one reason Mahler disagreed was that perhaps<br/>he had lost some of his ability to hear high-frequency overtones,<br/>due to aging and the volume of large orchestral _tuttis_ to which<br/>he exposed himself nearly every day in his duties as a conductor.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In the meantime, I&apos;ve added this info, along with the important<br/>&gt; &gt; stuff I found on Schoenberg&apos;s interest in microtonality, to my<br/>&gt; &gt; _A Century of New Music in Vienna_ webpage, which has just<br/>&gt; &gt; undergone a major update:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a great page...  It seems like you have added some more<br/>&gt; illustrations to this than I remember!  A great resource!</p><p>Thanks, Joe.  Yes, there are a lot more illustrations, and many,<br/>many more to come.  There has also been a big increase in the<br/>number of MIDI-files, particularly of Schoenberg&apos;s very early<br/>work.</p><p>(Unfortunately, after doing a lot of work on my MIDI-file<br/>of _Pelleas und Melisande_, I apparently saved it with the<br/>wrong name... and I can&apos;t fix it now while I&apos;m away from home,<br/>so for right now I&apos;ve had to disable the link to that file...)</p><p>I intend to eventually provide MIDI-files for all of the pieces<br/>I mention in that page... or at least excerpts of them.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Note that it appears that Webern&apos;s notation of microtones in<br/>&gt; &gt; these sketches of 1908/09 was the apparent inspiration for<br/>&gt; &gt; Schoenberg&apos;s later invention of _sprechstimme_!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be interesting to think about some of Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>&gt; ideas of SPEECH as one of the evolutionary mechanisms that<br/>&gt; created certain kinds of pitch discrimination...  Perhaps<br/>&gt; Schoenberg was actually going back to that (!?)</p><p>Hmmm... that&apos;s an interesting link that you&apos;ve noticed.  I suppose<br/>you&apos;re on the right track insofar as Schoenberg obviously had<br/>an incredibly good ear, and probably trained himself to hear<br/>overtones in human speech as well as in instruments.</p><p>But I think that mostly his invention of _sprechstimme_ had<br/>to do with his search for more expressive musical techniques.<br/>That seems to have been his biggest concern around 1904-12.</p><p>In connection with the question of who actually came up with<br/>the idea for _sprechstimme_, I should point out that Webern and<br/>Schoenberg both emphasized the way they (and Berg) all shared<br/>in the fantastic developments of this period.  Schoenberg said<br/>later in life that he had to be careful of mentioning new ideas<br/>to Webern because he &apos;stole&apos; them and immediately used them in<br/>his own pieces, and it&apos;s clear to me that it also worked the<br/>other way: in many cases, Webern used an interesting new idea<br/>first and Schoenberg developed it further and got the credit... it<br/>looks to me like that&apos;s exactly what happened with _sprechstimme_.</p><p>Thanks for the tips on searching for Busoni stuff via Luening.<br/>Since you&apos;re in NYC, can you look up any of this for me?  I can<br/>retrieve it when I visit you.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a><br/>&apos;All roads lead to n^0&apos;</p></div>
