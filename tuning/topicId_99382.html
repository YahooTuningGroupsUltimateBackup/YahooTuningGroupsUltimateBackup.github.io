The basic<br/>observations are:</p><p>1) Existing notation is built around the meantone/diatonic MOS.<br/>2) The # and b accidentals denote alteration by the chromatic interval<br/>c, which is equal to = L-s.<br/>3) Lines and spaces on the staff just include what position in the MOS<br/>you are. Sharps and flats indicate chromatic alteration as per the<br/>above.<br/>4) The whole thing is defined relative to some &quot;center&quot; note, which is<br/>the tonic for the &quot;unaltered&quot; scale. We call this note &quot;middle C&quot;<br/>(although you can use whatever names you want).<br/>5) By convention, this center note is one ledger line below the treble<br/>clef and one ledger line above the bass clef. We generalize the notion<br/>of &quot;treble&quot; and &quot;bass&quot;</p><p>That&apos;s it. So to generalize any regular temperament to a similar staff<br/>layout, simply<br/>1) Pick the representative &quot;albitonic&quot; MOS for that temperament<br/>2) Figure out which mode you want to use as the base, tonal mode.<br/>3) Find the tonic of this mode - tune it to 261 Hz (middle C). You<br/>don&apos;t have to call it &quot;C,&quot; but at least identify the note.<br/>4) This note goes one ledger line below the treble clef and one ledger<br/>line above the bass clef. Tenor and alto clefs are generalized as<br/>you&apos;d expect.<br/>5) Use as many lines as you want for each staff. 5 is standard, but if<br/>you have a larger MOS try 6, 7, etc.<br/>6) Sharps and flats mean alteration by c=L-s. Generalize other<br/>accidentals in the same way - e.g. if you&apos;re in meantone, the diesis<br/>is c_2 = |s-c_1|. Pick different symbols if you don&apos;t like # and b.</p><p>That&apos;s it, you&apos;re done. Pretty simple, I&apos;m sure someone&apos;s talked about<br/>or proposed this before. Note that the MOS you use doesn&apos;t have to be<br/>tempered if you really don&apos;t want it to; you can come up with a<br/>complex system of accidentals to signify a 3D or 4D temperament if you<br/>want.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=99407 href="#99407">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/21/2011 12:13:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike wrote:</p><p>&gt; That&apos;s it, you&apos;re done.

Except in this case, the &quot;literature&quot; in which A-G means the<br/>notes of the diatonic scale is the vocabulary of almost every<br/>practicing musician in any part of the world used to the western<br/>system of notation. I do think that they&apos;d have caught onto the notion<br/>that porcupine[7] is a &quot;porcupine diatonic,&quot; but I don&apos;t think they&apos;ll<br/>enjoy so much the notion that C-E in Pajara now corresponds to a 9/8<br/>rather than a 5/4.

Clearly, only the lines<br/>&gt; were used originally, for the pentatonic scale. :)</p><p>I see I&apos;ve opened the floodgates for lots of innovative ideas. I was<br/>getting at a different goal, which was figuring out an optimal system<br/>for existing musicians to adapt to, given what they already find<br/>&quot;simple&quot; and intuitive. In other words, I am coming from the exact<br/>opposite direction as the &quot;jammer&quot;/Janko/etc paradigm, which aims to<br/>rebuild things in a more intuitive way from the ground up.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Maybe ceil(n/2)+1 would work, which<br/>&gt; &gt; always gives you one note beyond the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s four lines for a 5- or 6-note scale, with nine<br/>&gt; lines and spaces before hitting ledgers and so more than<br/>&gt; one note beyond the octave in either case.</p><p>Yeah, I screwed up. I meant more to suggest having the lines on the<br/>staff reaching an octave in span from the top note to the bottom note,<br/>rounding up in the case of odd-numbered scales. So decatonic scales<br/>would have six lines and five spaces, spanning in total an octave.<br/>9-note scales would also have 6 lines, except in this case the scale<br/>would span an octave + one note. If the staff can&apos;t even represent an<br/>octave, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to be very useful.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=99472 href="#99472">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/22/2011 11:50:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Unfortunately, everyone has different ways of perceiving<br/>&gt; order in things - mathematicians have one way of doing it, and working<br/>&gt; musicians have another.
