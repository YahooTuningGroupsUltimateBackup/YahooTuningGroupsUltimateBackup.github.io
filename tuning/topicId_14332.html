The near-pure<br/>fifths and fourths, the regular major and minor thirds with ratios<br/>close to 14:11 and 13:11, and the diminished fourths and augmented<br/>seconds with a &quot;submajor/superminor&quot; flavor close to 21:17 and 17:14,<br/>are all there to be heard and relished.</p><p>However, as Vicentino demonstrated, a Renaissance meantone such as<br/>1/4-comma (almost equivalent to the 31-tone equal temperament or<br/>31-tET associated with Vicentino&apos;s keyboard by Lemme Rossi in 1666)<br/>also has wonderful secrets and surprises which only a larger tuning<br/>can discover. With Pepper&apos;s tuning, also, an archicembalo of 24 or<br/>more notes brings us new musical treasures and surprises.</p><p>--------------------------------------------<br/>2. Exploring 24 notes: Navigating the diesis<br/>--------------------------------------------</p><p>While neo-Gothic tunings have in many ways a radically different<br/>structure than Renaissance meantones, for tunings in the range of<br/>around 29-tET to 46-tET and slightly beyond I curiously find<br/>Vicentino&apos;s accidental notations to be quite apt at the brink of the<br/>21st century.</p><p>Going beyond 12 or 17 notes, in either type of tuning we (like<br/>Vicentino) may find it convenient to have a symbol for indicating a<br/>note raised by a _diesis_, in one definition the difference between<br/>two accidentals such as Ab and G#. In another definition, it is the<br/>amount by which 12 fifths differ (in either direction) from 7 pure<br/>octaves.</p><p>If Vicentino used 1/4-comma meantone with pure major thirds, then this<br/>diesis would have a size of 128:125 or ~41.06 cents, with Ab _higher_<br/>than G#, and 12 fifths falling short of an octave by this amount.<br/>Vicentino describes this diesis as equal to 1/5-tone. In Rossi&apos;s<br/>31-tET, it would be precisely 1/31 octave, ~38.71 cents.[2]</p><p>Interestingly, the diesis in the neo-Gothic neighborhood including<br/>Pepper&apos;s tuning has a size comparable to Vicentino&apos;s, but with Ab<br/>_lower_ than G#, and 12 fifths exceeding an octave by this amount. In<br/>Pepper&apos;s tuning, it is equal to ~49.15 cents.</p><p>To show a note raised by a diesis, Vicentino placed a dot above the<br/>note, here represented as an ASCII asterisk (*).</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s 36-note archicembalo, with two manuals each having three<br/>&quot;ranks&quot; of keys, has its first and fourth ranks -- the seven diatonic<br/>notes or &quot;white keys&quot; of each manual -- tuned a diesis apart. Thus C<br/>on the first manual would have the corresponding note C* on the second<br/>manual.</p><p>Drawing inspiration from this feature and generalizing it, we can<br/>arrange a 24-note archicembalo in either a Renaissance meantone such<br/>as Vicentino&apos;s or a neo-Gothic temperament such as Pepper&apos;s by tuning<br/>the first manual as usual, and tuning the second manual in identical<br/>fashion a diesis higher or lower. Following Vicentino&apos;s convention, I<br/>here have the second manual tuned a diesis above the first:</p><p>      C#*   Eb*            F#*    G#*  Bb*<br/> C*       D*      E*   F*     G*     A*     B*  C*<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>     C#    Eb             F#     G#   Bb<br/>C        D       E    F      G      A      B   C</p><p>In a neo-Gothic context, or more generally in any regular tuning with<br/>fifths larger than 700 cents, sharps are _higher_ than corresponding<br/>flats by a diesis: thus Eb* on the upper keyboard is equivalent to D#,<br/>and Bb* likewise to A#.[3] We are free to use either spelling. Some<br/>people may find it more natural to speak of &quot;the fifth G#-D#,&quot; for<br/>example, but &quot;the regular major third Eb*-G* on the upper manual.&quot;</p><p>--------------------------------------<br/>3. Four families of thirds in 24 notes<br/>--------------------------------------</p><p>Emulating Vicentino&apos;s exploration of thirds on his archicembalo, let&apos;s<br/>see how many flavors of thirds we can find on our 24-note neo-Gothic<br/>archicembalo in Pepper&apos;s tuning. Here it&apos;s helpful to keep in mind<br/>that raising a note by a diesis changes the size of an interval by<br/>about 49.15 cents.</p><p>In previous articles, I have discussed the two kindred families of<br/>thirds available within a 12-note tuning[4], and now also available in<br/>some new positions involving notes on both manuals. These families<br/>consist of regular major and minor thirds near 14:11 and 13:11; and<br/>diminished fourths and augmented seconds serving as alternative<br/>&quot;submajor/superminor&quot; thirds near 21:17 and 17:14. Both families have<br/>a complex and active quality fitting their unstable and often<br/>cadentialy directed role in neo-Gothic music.</p><p>To find the two intervals of our third family, &quot;maximal/minimal&quot;<br/>thirds, we play a fourth reduced by a diesis (e.g. C*-F), and a major<br/>second enlarged by a diesis (e.g. F-G*). The first interval is about<br/>(496 - 49) or 447 cents, while the second is about (208 + 49) or 257<br/>cents.</p><p>These maximal and minimal thirds, more precisely at about 446.76 and<br/>257.34 cents, have a striking quality, strongly inviting cadential<br/>resolutions in which the minimal third contracts to a unison and the<br/>maximal third expands to a fifth. They have some degree of &quot;category<br/>warping&quot; effect, approaching the domain of large major seconds and<br/>small fourths respectively (as their spellings suggest).</p><p>At the same time, they seem to me maybe a bit &quot;kinder and gentler&quot;<br/>than their counterparts near 13:10 (~454.21 cents) and 15:13 (~247.74<br/>cents) in 29-tET at 11/29 octave and 6/29 octave (~455.17 cents,<br/>~248.275 cents); or in 24-tET at 9/24 octave and 5/24 octave, an even<br/>450 cents and 250 cents.</p><p>To find our fourth family of &quot;schismalike&quot; thirds, we play an<br/>augmented second enlarged by a diesis (e.g. F-G#*), and its<br/>counterpart, a diminished fourth reduced by a diesis (e.g. G#*-C).<br/>The first interval has a size of about (337 + 49) or 386 cents, and<br/>the second about (367 - 49) or 318 cents.</p><p>Like Pythagorean diminished fourths and augmented seconds, or &quot;schisma<br/>thirds&quot; at about 384.36 and 317.60 cents, these intervals at around<br/>386.01 and 318.09 cents very closely approach pure ratios of 5:4<br/>(~386.31 cents) and 6:5 (~315.64 cents).</p><p>In a neo-Gothic style, these schismalike thirds might serve as moments<br/>of coloristic diversion; or they might move by diesis shifts and the<br/>like to other flavors of thirds resolving in a usual cadential<br/>manner.</p><p>Here is a quick summary of our four families of thirds in Keenan<br/>Pepper&apos;s tuning, with some of the examples of regular and alternative<br/>thirds illustrating how these intervals can be found in some new<br/>positions. As noted at the end of Section 2, the conventional spelling<br/>B-D# for the second example of a regular major third is equivalent to<br/>B-Eb* in the 24-note keyboard diagram there given:</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Family        Type   Examples       Cents   Description<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Regular       M3     F-A, B-D#      416.38   Usual major third, ~14:11<br/>              m3     D-F, A*-C*     287.71   Usual minor third, ~13:11<br/>......................................................................<br/>Alternative   dim4   C#-F, F*-A     367.24   Submajor,   ~21:17<br/>              Aug2   F-G#, D-F*     336.86   Superminor, ~17:14<br/>......................................................................<br/>Maximal/      Mx3    D*-G, F*-Bb    446.76   4th-less-diesis, ~22:17<br/>Minimal       mn3    G-A*, Bb-C*    257.34   M2-plus-diesis,  ~22:19<br/>......................................................................<br/>Schismalike   S3     F-G#*, Bb-C#*  386.01   Aug2-plus-diesis, ~5:4<br/>              s3     G#*-C, C#*-F   318.09   dim4-less-diesis, ~6:5<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>4. Our four families in perspective: The 704-cent neighborhood<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Having identified four families of thirds on our 24-note archicembalo,<br/>we may find it interesting to compare the subtly shifting qualities of<br/>these intervals in the general neighborhood of Pepper&apos;s tuning, the<br/>neighborhood with fifths of around 704 cents or slightly larger.</p><p>From Pepper&apos;s tuning at ~704.10 cents (~2.14 cents wide), we move to<br/>46-tET (~704.34 cents, ~2.39 cents wide) and an almost identical<br/>tuning with pure 14:11 major thirds (~704.38 cents, ~2.42 cents wide),<br/>and from there to an &quot;e-based&quot; tuning (~704.61 cents, ~2.65 cents<br/>wide) where the ratio of the whole-tone to the diatonic semitone is<br/>equal to Euler&apos;s famous _e_, 2.71828182845904523536029.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Type  Generator   Examples     Pepper     46-tET       14:11   e-based<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>            (Family 1: Regular major/minor thirds, M3/m3)<br/>M3    4 5ths up  F-A, E-G#     416.382  417.391 (16)  417.508  418.428<br/>m3    3 4ths up  E-G, C-Eb     287.713  286.957 (11)  286.869  286.179<br/>......................................................................<br/>  (Family 2: Alternative thirds, dim4/Aug2 or &quot;submajor/supraminor&quot;)<br/>dim4  8 4ths up  C#-F, B-Eb    367.235  365.217 (14)  364.984  363.145<br/>Aug2  9 5ths up  F-G#, F*-A    336.860  339.130 (13)  339.393  341.462<br/>......................................................................<br/>             (Family 3: Maximal/minimal thirds, Mx3/mn3)<br/>Mx3  14 5ths up  D*-G, A*-D    446.757  443.478 (17)  443.099  440.110<br/>mn3  13 4ths up  D-E*, A-B*    257.338  260.870 (10)  261.278  264.496<br/>......................................................................<br/>                (Family 4: Schismalike thirds, S3/s3)<br/>S3   21 5ths up  F-G#*, Bb-C#* 386.008  391.304 (15)  391.917  396.745<br/>s3   20 4ths up  G#*-C, C#*-F  318.088  313.043 (12)  312.460  307.862<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Having compared the regular and alternative thirds (Families 1 and 2)<br/>for these tunings in an earlier post[5], I focus here on some nuances<br/>of shading involving Families 3 and 4: the maximal/minimal and<br/>schismalike thirds.</p><p>Since maximal/minimal thirds are formed from 13 fourths up or 14<br/>fifths up, they are very sensitive to small changes of temperament.<br/>Interestingly, as we move from Pepper&apos;s tuning through 46-tET and the<br/>14:11 tuning to our e-based tuning, these intervals grow somewhat<br/>&quot;mellower.&quot; Maximal thirds contract from around 447 cents to 440<br/>cents, about 5 cents wide of the simpler &quot;valley&quot; of 9:7; minimal<br/>thirds expand from around 257 cents to 264 cents, only a bit more than<br/>2 cents narrow of the &quot;valley&quot; of 7:6</p><p>Our schismalike thirds formed from 21 fifths up or 20 fourths up, yet<br/>more sensitive to small distinctions of temperament, are very close to<br/>pure in Pepper&apos;s tuning.</p><p>By 46-tET or the 14:11 temperament, the major thirds of this family<br/>range between 391 and 392 cents, comparable to 1/5-comma or 2/11-comma<br/>meantone, although the minor thirds are much closer to pure than in a<br/>meantone because the large fifth allows them more &quot;room.&quot; In our<br/>e-based tuning, the major thirds approach 397 cents, comparable to<br/>1/8-comma meantone.</p><p>In appreciating the qualities of these 24-note temperaments, we might<br/>take an archicembalist&apos;s-eye view like that of Vicentino, embracing<br/>both the more familiar intervals and the more &quot;exotic&quot; or remote<br/>ones.</p><p>Keenan Pepper&apos;s tuning and its neighbors, like Vicentino&apos;s likely<br/>archicembalo temperament of 1/4-comma and its neighbors including<br/>Kornerup&apos;s Golden Meantone, suggest some of the possibilities for a<br/>new millennium of music.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. In 1/4-comma meantone, the size of the &quot;proximate minor third&quot; or<br/>neutral third varies slightly depending on whether one adds a diesis<br/>of ~41.06 cents to a regular minor third (310.26 + 41.06 = ~351.32<br/>cents); or subtracts a diesis from a regular major third at 5:4<br/>(386.31 - 41.06 = ~345.25 cents). Which of these sizes appears in<br/>which positions on an archicembalo depends on the order of the<br/>tuning. In 31-tET, this interval has a single size of 9/31 octave,<br/>~348.39 cents.</p><p>2. In an extended tuning in 1/4-comma meantone, we actually have two<br/>slightly unequal flavors of fifthtones: the familiar diesis of 128:125<br/>(e.g. G#-Ab), plus an interval equal to the chromatic semitone of<br/>~76.05 cents less this diesis, or ~34.99 cents (~50:49).</p><p>3. With Vicentino&apos;s meantone and other regular tunings with fifths<br/>smaller than 700 cents, however, flats are a diesis _higher_ than<br/>sharps, so that we have the equivalences C#*=Db, F#*=Gb, and G#*=Ab.<br/>In a 16th-century or derivative context, these identities can be very<br/>helpful, permitting these three keys in a 24-note tuning to serve at<br/>once as supplementary flats (providing the fifths Db-Ab, Gb-Db, and<br/>Ab-Eb) and as usual sharps in the &quot;parallel universe&quot; of the upper<br/>manual.</p><p>4.
