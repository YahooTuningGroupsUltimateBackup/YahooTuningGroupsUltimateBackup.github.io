That being said, as I&apos;ve mentioned, Bach is my favorite all time musician, and I&apos;ve studied his music and life for close to 30 years. And, after doing so, I believe that he probably used a number of different tunings, probably Werckmeister included; and from what I know about the kind of person he was, I feel there&apos;s a good chance he created his own tunings as well. Jeez, this is a feller with a wide ranging curiosity about the music of his era (as well as earlier times), from other countries as well as Germany, who spent countless hours studying, analyzing, and transcribing the music of many other composers...I can&apos;t imagine why he wouldn&apos;t have been just as curious about the wide variety of tunings which existed as well, and why he wouldn&apos;t have been somewhat curious about how they sounded...makes sense to me. And, as we know, he was a whiz at tuning his axe, so it wouldn&apos;t have presented him with much of a problem to do some exploring.</p><p>   Boy, maybe I&apos;m missing the boat here in some way, but I don&apos;t think so. And again, NOBODY KNOWS...end of story. It&apos;s all educated theories, and believe me, Johnny, I have a lot of respect for your musicality and understanding of music, Bach included...in fact, I still give out your well tempered article from Pitch to a lot of folks, it&apos;s very well written, and a great intro to the subject. And, you opened the door to this subject when you said: &quot;When the mind is developed with a single pattern of reference, including a single religion, and all the many stage fixations, etc., it is like a habit that won&apos;t break.&quot;  Um, who are you referring to here, anyway? Actually, and I am NOT trying to insult you here, but you brought  it up...that sentence sounds exactly like the way you feel about Werck lll.</p><p>   On this issue, speaking for myself only, my mind is not remotely developed with a single pattern of reference, especially with relation to Bach and his tunings...I am open to any possibility, and if it should someday be proved that he only used Werck lll, it will have little impact on my life in any way. Then, the debate is over, and that&apos;s that...but, until then, I believe he tinkered with tunings throughout his whole life, but it is not as huge a deal to me to be right about this as it seems to be for you. And, that is your business and personal privacy...but, you have been, sense of humor please, rather &quot;religious&quot; in a sense, about your commitment to Werck lll. No problem, man, it&apos;s just one part of your widely varied activities in music, and it doesn&apos;t stop me from having, as I said, a great deal of respect for your many accomplishments, and I&apos;m sure there&apos;s more to come...best...HHH<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>  <a href="http://agenturadellarte.net">agenturadellarte.net</a></p></div>
