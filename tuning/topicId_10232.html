Korg&apos;s Triton is<br/>reasonably well made, although I find that Korg tends to be inconsistant<br/>once you leave the safety of their flagship models (an opinion, of course).<br/>Keep in mind both the Triton and of especially Kurzweil break most people&apos;s<br/>definitions of affordability.</p><p>As far as the K5000, I disagree to an extent, but I will talk to you<br/>privately about that since it might be dragging this post on unnecessarily.<br/>=)</p><p>&gt;&gt; While, I will agree with you that thoughtful design goes a long way, I<br/>&gt;&gt; don&apos;t it can entirely break the wall of quality materials.

The<br/>&gt; recommended synth for the Microzone, last I checked, is the Kurzweil<br/>&gt; K2500.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>What I meant to say was the overall expense will far outstep the mere<br/>controller itself (sorry about that). But even so, I was not aware that it<br/>was expensive as you imply. Any idea of the expense offhand? Might be a<br/>couple of days before Starr gets back to me. =)</p><p>Hmm. I thought they recommended the Kyma, but maybe they were a tad pedantic<br/>for a &quot;worse case&quot; conditions as far as experimentation.</p><p>Speaking of the K2500, is everyone aware that Kurzweil is considerably<br/>cheaper from some of the European distributors than the United States?<br/>While, I do know a few people who did order it through <a href="http://musicians-gear.com">musicians-gear.com</a><br/>and had it sent overseas, I don&apos;t want to encourage something I haven&apos;t<br/>tested myself.</p><p>&gt;&gt; steps beyond what most synthesizers are able to provide....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not really.

It seems to really tax what most synthesizers<br/>have to offer. I am not sure if my K150&apos;s would be up to the task. But, as<br/>could be said, this could be the result of my lack of education regarding<br/>this instrument. If this is the case, I apologize. :P</p><p>&gt; if you can even handle a<br/>&gt; single timbre on this baby, you&apos;re a virtuoso.<br/>&gt;<br/>Hah really? Do you know any examples anywhere of people who can at least to<br/>some extent produce music on this thing?
