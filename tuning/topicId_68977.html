When<br/>there is no historical record which distinguishes between  then, so far<br/>as actual use was concerned.</p><p>Johnny:  There is straight-forward musical  information being transferred in<br/>WIII for certain composers, JS Bach being one  of them.  I&rsquo;m just being<br/>honest.<br/>Tom:  We know Werckmeister had his pals, who  might, or might not<br/>(particularly in the case of Bendeler) have used one or  other of his<br/>tunings. But I don&apos;t know why anyone should assume that it must  be<br/>&apos;III&apos; rather than anything else.<br/>Johnny:  In part it is to have a default to  ET.  The ET version of Bach does<br/>it  no favors.  Daniel indicated there  was an abundance of WIII recordings.<br/>Neil and Dave, there are only the ones I have already  listed:<br/>Kipnis, Koopman, Pechefsky, and  Reinhard.  These are preferable  examples of<br/>comparison to midi files.</p><p>WIII is the chromatic tuning, placed  in an order of descriptions that gives<br/>prestige to the chromatic composer.   While the author does not claim to  need<br/>the full usage of all the 24 keys, he demonstrates that he admires  them.  I<br/>know it is difficult for  some to connect the dots the way I do, but that is<br/>what this List is about.  Put it out there.</p><p>Tom:  I also don&apos;t know of any place in  Werckmeister&apos;s writings where it<br/>says that WIII is in some way better than  all his other tunings.<br/>Johnny: Throughout his entire life,  Werckmeister favored the diatonic keys<br/>for more just treatment as detailed in  Misicalische Temperatur through the<br/>monochords.<br/>SNIP<br/>Tom:  Well, most of Brandenburg 2 is very  diatonic, for example. So why<br/>choose &apos;III&apos; rather than &apos;IV&apos; or 1698?</p><p>Johnny:  It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to shift between a  lot of different tunings,<br/>either.  Brandenburg 2 is audibly influenced by WIII,  and it works well.<br/>There is a need  for something to plug in as a default, and WIII deserves to be<br/>that default, not  ET, and not a modern speculation open to just anything.<br/>That is not in the best interest of the  music.  The very meaning is deeper  in<br/>WIII to my ears.  But it is not a  tuning for everything, merely for the music<br/>for which it was intended.  The modern piano, with 3 strings per  key, is not<br/>a good instrument for WIII, accordingly.</p><p>Tom:  Even in his last work of 1707 where he  talks about using ET, or some<br/>tuning which is purer than ET in the most-used  keys, all he says is<br/>&apos;And these [variations] may be tolerated in the  temperaments contained<br/>in my Monochord.&apos; Nothing to imply that one of the  temperaments is<br/>more or less tolerable than another.</p><p>Johnny:  Couldn&rsquo;t this be because each tuning as  a location for its tonic<br/>that simulates basic tunings and meantones?  WIII could be almost just, almost<br/>Pythagorean, almost ET, almost sixthcomma, etc.  A chromatic composer would<br/>naturally  choose the chromatic choice, WIII.</p><p>Tom:  So, any historical clue at all that  somehow, WIII exclusively was<br/>intended, and his other schemes, however  carefully worked out, simply<br/>blowing smoke?</p><p>Johnny:  The historical clues are in Wender&rsquo;s  tunings in Arnstadt and<br/>Muhlhausen.  It continues in the keyboard usage for all Bach&rsquo;s music, the great<br/>preponderance of which is notated outside the meantone compass (Barbour).  My<br/>position is that there was a favorite  way for JS to get around the keyboard for<br/>full chromatic usage.  It was certainly used by his uncle JC  Bach, who was<br/>likely the chromatic composer Werckmeister was thinking  about.  The use of WIII<br/>is a good  reason for sixth comma meantone, in the sense that it mirrors WIII<br/>much better  than quarter comma meantone.</p><p>Tom:  (Plus the question: how exactly does one  tune WIII by ear? Where does<br/>the schisma  go?)</p><p>~~~T~~~<br/>Johnny:  It is eminently tunable by ear.  I have done so.  The pure fifths<br/>are easy enough.  As for quarter comma flat fifths of 696  cents, I&rsquo;m a modern<br/>who hears it well.  Bach then, it could have been anything, maybe a  recorder?<br/>Best,  Johnny</p></div>
