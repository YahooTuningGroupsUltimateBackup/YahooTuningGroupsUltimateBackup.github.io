Since his book was<br/>published in 1971, this predates &quot;Erlich&apos;s decatonic comma&quot;;<br/>and &quot;tritonic diesis&quot; suffers from the fact that way, way to many<br/>things are called a &quot;diesis&quot;. I think &quot;jubilee&quot; is a fine name for<br/>this comma, at least for anyone not allergic to biblical references.</p></div>
