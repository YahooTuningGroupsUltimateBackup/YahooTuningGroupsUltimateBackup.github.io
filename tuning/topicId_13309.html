Nevertheless, the clock<br/>is for sale at the clockshop. Having been sold, his assignment is to ring<br/>his alarm at 5 a.m. which is nine hours from the time he does the math that<br/>is supposed to tell him how many ticks to count before ringing the alarm.<br/>The math is as follows:<br/>&quot;Letr&apos;s see. There&apos;s 60 minutes to the hour, and 60 times 60 is, um 3,600<br/>ticks to the hour, and for 9 hours, from 8 to 5 o&apos;clock is, um,<br/>6 *8 is 48, movwe the zero over where the 7 was and multiply the zero by<br/>8*3, then move the 7 over where the zero was and that comes to 32,4000 ticks.&quot;<br/>Talk about fuzzy logic!</p></div>
