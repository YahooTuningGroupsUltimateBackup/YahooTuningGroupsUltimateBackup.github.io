I found only one piece -- Odd Piano by Kees Van Prooijen. I still thought that was not enough for me and, finally, I ended up having made a short piece myself. It was pretty hard for me to do with the XG standard limitations (i.e. I had to normalize parts of the scale into a single octave range as the XG retuning format has not been developed with any consideration of non-octave scales at all) but, anyway, I managed to get at least the regular 10-tone BP diatonic out of it. The scale I used is not the equal-tempered version, it&apos;s a linear temperament with a period slightly wider than 3/1 (to be precise, 1/8 of the BP comma of 245/243) and the generator being 3/8 of the BP comma wider than 9/7. The reason why I chose this temperament is that the basic ratios are very well approximated here. Not only the 3/1 is widened by 1/8 of the BP comma but also 5/1 and 7/1 are both narrowed by 1/8 of that comma. Okay, here it is: <a href="http://download.yousendit.com/D0F7E8EB068C4C31">http://download.yousendit.com/D0F7E8EB068C4C31</a></p><p>Petr</p></div>
