(To recap: we have<br/>&gt; the counting numbers [positive integers],<br/>&gt; then the integers [positive and negatve],<br/>&gt; then rational fractions [ratios of integers],<br/>&gt; then algebraic irrational numbers [produced<br/>&gt; by the solution of an algebraic equation with<br/>&gt; a finite number of terms], then transcendental<br/>&gt; irrational numbers [produced by the solution of<br/>&gt; a trasncendental equation, viz., an equation<br/>&gt; involving the number e], then real numbers,<br/>&gt; then transfinite numbers, then hypperreal<br/>&gt; numbers [in non-standard analysis], and finally<br/>&gt; hyperinfinite numbers [1 divided by an infinitesimal].</p><p>Don&apos;t forget our pals the surreal numbers. John Conway invented them<br/>while working on game theory. They include all the usual suspects,<br/>plus the hyperreals, and odd things like (aleph null)/pi.</p><p>As far a generating transcendental numbers, you can generate a subset<br/>by taking x=a^b where a is algebraic (but not 0 or 1) and b is a non<br/>rational algebraic number.
