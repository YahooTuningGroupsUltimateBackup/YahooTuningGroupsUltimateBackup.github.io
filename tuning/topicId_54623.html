I&apos;m working<br/>at Camp Rising Sun for teenage boys.  It is an international full scholarship<br/>leadership camp and I am the musical counselor (since 1979, on and off).</p><p>Half the camp listened carefully to the new Ives Universe Symphony recording<br/>produced by Mike Thorne.  Besides sharing my own polymicrotonal music, the<br/>whole of camp is preparing a performance of my cello concerto Odysseus.  All are<br/>playing musical instruments, each in its own tuning, each in its own<br/>theatrical role corresponding to the storyline of the &quot;Odyssey.&quot;  The audience, made up<br/>of the neighboring girls camp, and the actual time of the 75th anniversary of<br/>the camp, should bring out the best.</p><p>Former alum of Camp Rising Sun in the music area are:  Robert Dick<br/>(composer/flutist), Stephen Mayer (composer/pianist...who is having his quartertone<br/>cello and piano Sonata on the same day), Pete Seeger (who will be performing that<br/>day as well), Philip Corner (composer, former counselor),</p><p>and</p><p>Johnny Reinhard.  Best!</p></div>
