I agree that there can be no equal-tempered fractal<br/>tuning, but is it not possible to have a scale that is derived from a<br/>self-similar, recursive process, even within an equal temperament?  For<br/>example:</p><p>0.......5..7.......12(octave)</p><p>divide the interval of 5 (0 to 5 in a similar way):</p><p>0..2.3..5  (using uneven halves that fall within the tuning)</p><p>divide the interval of 5 (7 to 12 in a similar way):</p><p>7..9.10..12 (again using uneven halves that fall within the tuning)</p><p>put the two halves together and get:</p><p>0..2.3..5..7..9.10..12  (or the so-mis-called &quot;dorian&quot; mode)</p><p>Not very exotic, I&apos;ll grant you, but self-similar nonetheless.  Similar<br/>processes could be carried out  with other equal temperaments.</p><p>&#x9;Am I defining either &quot;fractal&quot; or &quot;scale&quot; too narrowly (or too broadly)<br/>hear?</p><p>Hoping that the fire-proff jacket isn&apos;t made of asbestos,</p><p>Jon Southwood<br/><a href="mailto:noj@cedar-rapids.net">noj@cedar-rapids.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul H.

Your example is only stage two in the construction so would hardly<br/>qualify as a fractal -- there isn&apos;t really a part of the scale that&apos;s<br/>similar to the _whole_ scale. Many natural fractals, such as organs found in<br/>the human body, have ten or more levels of self-similarity.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
