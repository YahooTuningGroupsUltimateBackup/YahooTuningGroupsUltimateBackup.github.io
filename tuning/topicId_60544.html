That, and most piano tuners don&apos;t set a<br/>very good ET.</p><p>Guitars are next.  They&apos;re largely ET.  Intonation varies a<br/>bit depending on where you are on the neck.  And many<br/>styles emphasize string bending (blues especially).</p><p>After that, things get ever farther from ET.  It requires<br/>many years of skill and training to play strings or wind<br/>instruments in ET... and in ensemble situations many<br/>performers tend to make their chords closer to just<br/>intonation.  Melodies usually wind up being &apos;all over the<br/>place&apos;.</p><p>The voice is perhaps the most flexible instrument of all.</p><p>Nevertheless, most western music assumes ET, or at least<br/>&quot;adaptive JI&quot; (jargon we&apos;ve developed on this list) where<br/>the 81:80 (syntonic comma) vanishes.</p><p>One way to think of alternative tunings is as an effort<br/>to increase the precision, or level of discrimination, of<br/>tuning in music.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=60591 href="#60591">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2005 1:47:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>They think they are playing 12 Et but in fact the intonation vary any chance their instruments allow them too.<br/>for all types of difference reasons,. cadences for example.

What<br/>I suppose I mean ws that they are deliberately AIMING<br/>for ET. So for me as a player, my aim cond=cerning<br/>pitch would be to become more and more sensitive to<br/>hearing my pitch (I have noticed that this is a skill<br/>lacking in quite a few shakuhachi players it seems)<br/>and then of course controlling it. One example of<br/>course is that as the breath decreases to the end of<br/>the note, the pitch drops. So we must counter that<br/>effect, and so on. And then as a MAKER, I must try to<br/>create the instrument in such a way that it is as<br/>close as possible to ET thus making the job of the<br/>player much easier. The added difficulty with<br/>shakuhachi is that there are only 5 holes, so we can<br/>tune those 5, but the other pitches are totally<br/>controlled by the player.<br/>So what I really meant was, don&apos;t most western<br/>musicians AIM for exact equal temperament?<br/>More below:</p><p>&gt;  Or is there a concious choice that the<br/>&gt; &gt; musicians are making, deliberately choosing to<br/>&gt; play<br/>&gt; &gt; slightly flat or sharp from the ET scale?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sometimes, certainly.</p><p>Do you mean that they sometimes use just intonation?<br/>I.e. for certain performances they chose just<br/>intonation instead of ET? That seems fine. But I am<br/>more interested in whether they might make a moment to<br/>moment choice, or note to note. I.e. let&apos;s say they<br/>are playing in a specific tuning (or aiming to let&apos;s<br/>say!), eg ET or just or whatever. Now, in the piece,<br/>would they ever DELIBERATELY stray from that tuning? I<br/>mean, not accidently, but, for example feel &quot;I want<br/>this note to be a little higher&quot; or whatever. I am not<br/>talking about glissando or such things. Actually my<br/>question is largely from an experience I had in a<br/>baroque concert I went to. There was one note played<br/>on a violin at one point in the melody. At that point,<br/>I felt &quot;Oh, that is an interesting choice!&quot; I felt<br/>that I would have played the note at a different<br/>pitch. It did not sound WRONG. It sounded fine. And<br/>that is why it occured to me that there might be a<br/>choice. I am not trained in western music. I don&apos;t<br/>know about that note. But I felt, that it COULD have<br/>been played at a different pitch, and have been nice.<br/>So it occured to me that there might be not a RIGHT<br/>way, but a CHOICE. And I was wondering if in the<br/>western music scene there actually IS this kind of<br/>choice. So that is my question.<br/>Thanks again for all the response from everyone.

I think *vertical* or *simultaneous* JI is more<br/>than a utopia and is perfectly appropriately applicable to much<br/>music. I&apos;d love to hear lots of Western music performed in adaptive<br/>JI, and I think it would be great for the music. It&apos;s just that a<br/>*strict* JI approach -- where vertical *and* horizontal intervals are<br/>simple ratios or compounds thereof -- to Western music has certain<br/>problems and I feel one can usually do better. On the other hand,<br/>strict JI is a perfectly good starting point for *new* compositions<br/>and styles and I don&apos;t think those making music in it consitute<br/>a &quot;special curiosity&quot; or are pursuing a &quot;utopia&quot;. It&apos;s simply<br/>something different from what occured in the history of Western<br/>music. North Indian music, on the other hand, *is* largely based on a<br/>strict JI framework.

Comma shifts are also difficult to perform, and<br/>going flat is no fun either.</p><p>I don&apos;t believe performers implement Vicentino&apos;s scheme exactly,<br/>but I think melodic evenness and the pitch standard guide them<br/>over time more strongly than a fixed just intonation scale.<br/>They naturally arrive at a solution like Vicentino&apos;s by tuning<br/>chords pure.  In fact I very regularly hear them slide notes<br/>into just position after hitting them somewhat inaccurately at<br/>first.  And in quicker passages, vertical intonation is given up<br/>before melodic &apos;correctness&apos;.</p><p>Note that by &quot;melodic continuity&quot; above, I mean not only the<br/>absence of comma shifts and pitch drift that Paul mentioned, but<br/>also the fact that the meantone scale (and the Pythagorean scale,<br/>which I think may be closer to what happens in practice) have a<br/>lower &quot;mean variety&quot; (Rothenberg) than JI scales -- there are<br/>fewer different types of intervals between scale tones (famously,<br/>there are only whole- and half- tones).  A high &quot;mean variety&quot;<br/>leads, I believe, to the &quot;pinched&quot; sound of your first audio<br/>example.</p><p>To answer Paul&apos;s question, I think the pinched sound may be<br/>desirable in some cases.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=60711 href="#60711">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2005 1:04:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Guglielmo &lt;gugliel@g...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; wallyesterpaulrus said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;The diatonic scale came<br/>&gt;  &gt;first chronologically, and I feel is still &quot;aethetically prior&quot;<br/>as a<br/>&gt;  &gt;musical entity in this music.
