The Hammond organ for instance, is an RI<br/>system with an odd limit less than 100, however to most<br/>listeners and players, it represents the irrational 12tet<br/>system. Similarly (EDO of choice) is an irrational system<br/>which can approximate a (limit of choice) JI system with<br/>sufficient accuracy as to be virtually indistinguishable.&quot;</p><p>I&apos;ve thrown some of my editorial biases into this old<br/>chestnut of a topic. whatever...</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=33290 href="#33290">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/2002 2:25:40 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Robert C Valentine &lt;BVAL@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Personally, I think the Just Intonation Network definition<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   <a href="http://www.dnai.com/~jinetwk">www.dnai.com/~jinetwk</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; is a good definition describing what modern practitioners<br/>&gt; mean when they say that they are working in just intonation.</p><p>&quot;JUST INTONATION is any system of tuning in which all of the intervals can be represented by ratios of whole numbers, with a strongly-implied preference for the smallest numbers compatible with a given musical purpose.&quot;</p><p>I think this a good place to start, and I like your additions below.
