The<br/>particular thing it exploited was fixed, but of course many continue to<br/>have the older unpatched versions of Outlook Express, and so are vulnerable to it<br/>One may have it already without knowing about it if one doesn&apos;t have<br/>an AV program.</p><p>It worked by infecting the signature line of an e-mail.</p><p>It is pretty harmless. Now and again the user would get a message saying<br/>Kak says no for this evening, when you try to turn on your computer<br/>- 11th of every month at 4 p.m.</p><p>Also occasional strange messages with the word Kak in it.<br/>You can get free Kak cleaners to remove it, and of course,<br/>install the patch for Outlook Express.</p><p>I believe there have been others like that too. These are the<br/>details about kak:</p><p><a href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/wscript.kakworm.html">http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/wscript.kakworm.html</a></p><p>If one doesn&apos;t want to get Norton, McAFFee or Dr Solomon,<br/>You can get a program called AVG anti virus. which is free for<br/>personal use and has had excellent reports. It doesn&apos;t make much<br/>sense to run a p.c. without any virus protection as one so often<br/>hears of someone losing data because of one.</p><p><a href="http://www.grisoft.com/html/us_index.html">http://www.grisoft.com/html/us_index.html</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=31398 href="#31398">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2001 5:37:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Many thanks Robert Walker,</p><p>for saving us all by finding &quot;Expand Messages&quot;.
