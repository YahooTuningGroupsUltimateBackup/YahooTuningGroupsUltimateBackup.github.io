This is the kind of stuff I could be very interested in<br/>discussing and experiencing in a &quot;live&quot; group situation, with real<br/>human auras intermingling. When sitting in front of a computer<br/>screen, though, I tend to be more interested in &quot;cold, hard<br/>facts&quot; . . . that&apos;s the mindset that I have to be in, anyway, most of<br/>the time I&apos;m in front of the computer. I suppose I&apos;ve<br/>compartmentalized my personality somewhat. So I think I&apos;ll pass on<br/>joining your list for now, though I&apos;d love to join in any &quot;live&quot;<br/>activities that may be associated with it, and listen to music and<br/>view artwork that comes about as a result of your new list. So<br/>please, keep me informed!</p><p>-Paul</p></div><h3><a id=23689 href="#23689">ðŸ”—</a>X. J.
