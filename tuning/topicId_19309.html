This would<br/>      make pure Renaissance concords available on all 19 steps.</p><p>      In practice, Vicentino could only fit 17 notes on the<br/>      upper manual, omitting the E# and B# keys from this<br/>      manual but otherwise realizing the scheme on his 36-note<br/>      archicembalo and arciorgano.</p><p>      While even the highly skilled player of Vicentino&apos;s<br/>      instrument would be unlikely to maintain just sonorities<br/>      at all points, his scheme indeed makes it possible to<br/>      sound such sonorities combining &quot;perfect fifths and<br/>      perfect thirds&quot; _frequently_ in the course of a piece.<br/>      Slow note-against-note textures where one has time to<br/>      choreograph complex hand and finger motions, and<br/>      sustained cadential sonorities, might especially<br/>      invite the extraordinary effects he reports in his<br/>      description of the _arciorgano_ in 1561.</p><p>      One feature very convenient to the practical player<br/>      is the possibility of reverting to regular meantone<br/>      for progressions or passages which would pose problems<br/>      in maintaining just intonation. Such a solution would<br/>      accommodate rapid melodic passages, or places where a<br/>      sustained note awkward to break into two parts might<br/>      call for a change of keyboard at a point where the<br/>      other voices shift from one just sonority to another.</p><p>      Such an eminently practical approach to this<br/>      remarkable instrument and adaptive tuning system might<br/>      be nicely in keeping with the views of Vicentino<br/>      himself, who defines the music of his time as &quot;tempered<br/>      and mixed&quot; even while ingeniously facilitating a union<br/>      between the melodic regularity of meantone and the<br/>      pure concords of Renaissance just intonation.</p><p>      Even with this accommodation, mastering such an<br/>      adaptive system and its fingering techniques<br/>      seems now as then a daunting feat; but Vicentino&apos;s<br/>      solution may be of interest both as a basis for<br/>      automated performances (e.g. MIDI-based) of<br/>      16th-century music, and as a model of what singers<br/>      and players of flexible-pitch instruments may<br/>      do in live ensemble performances, then and now.</p><p>      For example, Zarlino (1558) observes that singers<br/>      tend toward purely intoned concords, but without<br/>      the complication of small intervals (specifically<br/>      commas) found on keyboards tuned in the syntonic<br/>      diatonic. Vincenzo Galilei (1581) likewise notes<br/>      the absence of such obvious commas, and concludes<br/>      that singers must follow a regular tuning somewhat<br/>      like meantone on keyboards.</p><p>      The hypothesis of adaptive ensemble tuning might<br/>      accommodate both these 16th-century observations<br/>      regarding vocal intonation, without necessarily<br/>      excluding other approaches now and then such as<br/>      an intonation closer to the syntonic diatonic with<br/>      unequal major seconds or whole-tones and some<br/>      comma shifting or drifting.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
