Part of the richness and complexity of this<br/>dialogue may lie in the fact that typically &quot;JI&quot; may actually imply a<br/>combination of musical traits and associations, leaving different<br/>people free to emphasize different aspects.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. The 16th-century ideal type for &quot;JI&quot;: the PRI model<br/>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>From an historical point of view, the development in Western European<br/>theory of a concept of &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; intonation distinct from<br/>the newly standardized process of _participatio_ or temperament seems<br/>to be a development of the later 15th and 16th centuries. A system of<br/>pure intervals and ratios featuring stable sonorities based on the<br/>prime factors of 2, 3, and 5 (2-3-5 JI) stands in contrast both to<br/>earlier Gothic systems of Pythagorean tuning (2-3 JI) and to regular<br/>temperaments.</p><p>By the time of Fogliano (1529), Zarlino (1558), or Bottrigari (1594),<br/>three distinctive aspects of such a system based on the syntonic<br/>diatonic of Ptolemy have gained recognition:</p><p>         1. Purity (P). A fixed-pitch instrument in a JI tuning<br/>            presents consonant intervals in their most &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>            or &quot;sonorous&quot; form.</p><p>         2. Rationality (R). A JI tuning is based on integer<br/>            ratios, especially those of Zarlino&apos;s _senario_<br/>            (the natural numbers 1-6), in contrast to the<br/>            irrational ratios of temperament.</p><p>         3. Intricacy/Incommensurability (I). A JI tuning,<br/>            unlike either the older Pythagorean tuning or<br/>            a meantone temperament, is not regular, but<br/>            involves such intervals as the syntonic comma<br/>            resulting from what has been termed the<br/>            &quot;incommensurate&quot; nature of prime factors<br/>            such as 3 and 5.</p><p>All three themes emerge in 16th-century discussions of just tuning and<br/>temperament. Zarlino, for example, describes JI keyboards as<br/>&quot;perfectly tuned in accord with the perfection of the harmonic<br/>numbers,&quot; and as including &quot;minute intervals&quot; such as the syntonic<br/>comma of 81:80 (~21.51 cents).[1]</p><p>He therefore focuses on a &quot;perfectly tuned&quot; instrument, our purity<br/>property (P); the &quot;perfection of the harmonic numbers,&quot; our<br/>rationality property (R); and the presence of &quot;minute intervals,&quot; our<br/>intricacy or incommensurability property (I).</p><p>In his dialogue, Bottrigari likewise has his expositor explain that a<br/>listener accustomed to tempered keyboard instruments has heard only<br/>the diapason or octave in its &quot;true form,&quot; and that a tuning based on<br/>the &quot;true plurality of strings&quot; must include diatonic notes (e.g. two<br/>versions of D, Bb) not found on conventional instruments.[2]</p><p>The continued use of such terms as &quot;the Just scale&quot; (i.e. the syntonic<br/>diatonic with its pure 2-3-5 ratios), and of such categorical<br/>distinctions as &quot;Pythagorean/meantone/just,&quot; suggests that these<br/>16th-century concepts may still present a kind of ideal type for &quot;JI,&quot;<br/>albeit an ideal type subject both to extension and to broadening.[3]</p><p>-----------------------------------<br/>2. Variations on PRI: counting to 7<br/>-----------------------------------</p><p>Starting from the classic 16th-century model of 2-3-5 JI with its pure<br/>tunings of all stable sonorities (P), rational ratios for all<br/>intervals (R), and intricate syntonic commas (I), we can extend or<br/>vary this PRI model by adding or substituting other primes.</p><p>For example, admitting the prime factor of 7, we have such additional<br/>PRI possibilities as these:</p><p>         2-3-5-7 JI     For example, a tetradic system based on the<br/>                        the stable 4:5:6:7 or 12:14:18:21.</p><p>         2-3-7 JI       For example, a neo-Gothic system with stable<br/>                        2-3 sonorities (e.g. 2:3:4) and unstable<br/>                        2-3-7 sonorities (e.g. 14:18:21:24).</p><p>In such systems, all stable sonorities (and in the neo-Gothic example<br/>also many unstable sonorities) would be represented by pure intervals;<br/>all intervals derived from integer ratios; and intricacy would prevail<br/>in the form of the syntonic comma (81:80) and/or septimal comma<br/>(64:63, ~27.26 cents).</p><p>Another facet of intricacy is the element in these systems of notably<br/>unequal whole-tones: 9:8 and 10:9 in classic 2-3-5 JI; 9:8 and 8:7 in<br/>2-3-7 JI; and all three sizes in 2-3-5-7 JI.</p><p>While some of these systems may involve interval aesthetics quite<br/>distinct from those of 16th-century music, I suspect that most people<br/>would readily accept them as instances of &quot;JI&quot; tunings; the PRI model<br/>is extended or altered, but not compromised in its conceptual traits.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Some broadened interpretations of &quot;JI&quot; -- PR, RI, PI<br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>If the PRI model offers an &quot;ideal type&quot; for JI, what happens if we<br/>consider less characteristic &quot;JI&quot; systems featuring the intersection<br/>of two of our three properties, but not all three? Let us consider<br/>some of the possibilities.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>3.1. Purity and Rationality -- Pythagorean tuning or 2-3 JI<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In the musical setting of Continental Western Europe during the Gothic<br/>era of the 13th and 14th centuries, Pythagorean tuning or 2-3 JI may<br/>present an ideal case of a PR system:</p><p>         1. (P)urity. All stable intervals and sonorities (2:3:4,<br/>            3:4:6) are available in pure form.</p><p>         2. (R)ationality. All intervals are derived from integer<br/>            ratios, specifically the powers of 2 and 3.</p><p>         3. (I)ntricacy. As a regular tuning, Pythagorean<br/>            does _not_ feature the kind of intricacy present in<br/>            2-3-5, 2-3-5-7, or 2-3-7 systems involving the<br/>            syntonic and/or septimal commas; all regular<br/>            whole-tones have a single size of 9:8.</p><p>Thus we have P and R, but not I. Such a &quot;PR&quot; or 2-3 system seems<br/>instinctively to fit the usual aural and mathematical concepts of JI,<br/>although its regularity and comparative simplicity may give it a<br/>radically different feeling for the player of a fixed-pitch<br/>instrument than the intricacy of a 2-3-5, 2-3-5-7, or 2-3-7 system.</p><p>More specifically, we might say that the Gothic 2-3 and Renaissance<br/>2-3-5 systems share a property of &quot;Pstable&quot; (with &quot;stable&quot; to be read<br/>as a subscript) -- the Purity property holds for at least the subset<br/>of intervals which may appear in stable sonorities.</p><p>Other JI systems might fit such additional versions of the P property<br/>as &quot;Pcompatible&quot; or &quot;Pcompat&quot; for short, for example a neo-Gothic 3-7<br/>system where all usual diatonic intervals deemed in Gothic theory to<br/>be stable or &quot;unstable but compatible&quot; (notably excluding m2, M7, and<br/>A4 or d5) are available within a 9-odd-limit.</p><p>In a Pythagorean PR system, as in more intricate PRI systems uniting<br/>three or more prime factors, we have an intersection of two basic<br/>premises which seem to characterize &quot;JI&quot; for many people, albeit with<br/>differing degrees of emphasis on one premise or the other:</p><p>         1. A JI system should provide the purest possible<br/>            intervals for stable sonorities -- or some<br/>            equivalent set in musics not based on such<br/>            concepts as stability/instability; and</p><p>         2. A JI system should be based exclusively on<br/>            rational ratios, as opposed to the irrational<br/>            ratios of temperament.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>3.2. Rationality and Intricacy: Complex RI systems<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>While the element of &quot;purity&quot; is associated in the classic<br/>16th-century model with integer ratios, this association (in usual<br/>harmonic timbres) more specifically suggests _small_ integer ratios<br/>with an audible &quot;locking-in&quot; of partials. Modern theorists such as<br/>Paul Erlich and Dave Keenan have suggested that for interval ratios<br/>a:b, the limit of such &quot;purity&quot; may be reached at around a*b=99 or<br/>a*b=104 (for example, respectively 11:9 and 13:8).</p><p>Traditional PRI and PR systems, of course, typically include _some_<br/>complex ratios going beyond this &quot;limit of aural purity,&quot; and it is<br/>also possible to design some nontraditional PRI system featuring such<br/>complex ratios.</p><p>For example, suppose we decide on a 2-3-7-11 scheme featuring stable<br/>2:1 octaves, 2:3 fifths, and 4:3 fourths (as in Pythagorean 2-3 JI),<br/>plus unstable major thirds at 14:11 and minor thirds at 33:28. Such a<br/>scheme fulfills PR (i.e. Pstable, R), and additionally introduces the<br/>intricacy factor of the 896:891 comma, ~9.69 cents (the difference,<br/>for example, between 14:11 and the usual Pythagorean 81:64).</p><p>However, what about a system where all intervals are derived from<br/>integer ratios, but there is no set of pure intervals corresponding to<br/>that of a PRI or PR system?</p><p>If the system is defined _only_ by the R property, then it might<br/>approximate any familiar (or unfamiliar) temperament as closely as<br/>desired. One might ask, &quot;What is distinctively &apos;JI&apos; about this tuning<br/>from a musical perspective?&quot;</p><p>However, such a non-P tuning might combine Rationality with Intricacy<br/>-- for example, by featuring various kinds of commas or schismas<br/>shaping its complex ratios into a pattern somewhat analogous to that<br/>of a PRI system.</p><p>Such an RI system would then seem to have qualities distinct from<br/>either a usual temperament with its less intricate structure, or a PRI<br/>or PR system of JI with its set of pure intervals.</p><p>As it happens, the initials RI could also stand for &quot;Rational<br/>Intonation,&quot; a term sometimes applied also to PR or PRI systems where<br/>complex sonorities play a central role along with pure ones (for<br/>example, the unstable cadential sonorities of Gothic or neo-Gothic<br/>music).</p><p>Here it should be noted that radical RI systems, as described for<br/>example by Jacky Ligon, might focus especially on _melodic_ aspects of<br/>integer-based music. The ancient Greek interest in superparticular<br/>melodic intervals, for example semitones of 16:15 or 28:27, may<br/>provide a time-honored precedent for this type of JI approach, with a<br/>focus on _emmeles_ or &quot;intervals apt for melodic progressions.&quot;</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>3.3. Purity and Intricacy (PI) -- Two possible interpretations<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A focus on the &quot;just&quot; elements of Purity and Intricacy (PI) might<br/>suggest a Setharean approach based on irrational ratios fitting the<br/>spectrum of a given timbre, especially a notably inharmonic one where<br/>such ratios might in fact maximize the traditional JI value of ideal<br/>sensory consonance.</p><p>A different interpretation of PI, actually including the R property<br/>also, might follow along the lines of an artist such as LaMonte Young:<br/>using &quot;intricately&quot; complicated sonorities based on integer ratios in<br/>order to _make_ certain complex integer ratios _contextually_ &quot;pure,&quot;<br/>i.e. featuring aurally distinct meshings of partials.</p><p>To borrow a distinction from medieval theory, such complex intervals<br/>are &quot;pure&quot; _per accidens_ (&quot;by circumstance&quot;) rather than _per se_<br/>(&quot;in themselves&quot;) -- or, one might say, they participate in sonorities<br/>which have such a property of purity.</p><p>-------------------------------<br/>4. &quot;Adaptive JI&quot;: PRstable-vert<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>While the term &quot;adaptive JI&quot; can apply to various kinds of keyboard<br/>arrangements (e.g. neo-Gothic 3-7 JI realized by two Pythagorean<br/>manuals tuned a septimal comma apart as an &quot;adaptive&quot; modification of<br/>a regular Pythagorean tuning with the manuals a Pythagorean comma<br/>apart), I would like here to address an &quot;adaptive&quot; model of a kind<br/>which might be applicable to either fixed or continuous sets of<br/>pitches.</p><p>This variety of &quot;adaptive JI&quot; might be summed up in terms of PRI about<br/>as follows:</p><p>         1. (P)urity. All stable sonorities are available in forms<br/>             with pure intervals, satisfying this JI property.</p><p>         2. (R)ationality. All _vertical_ intervals of _stable_<br/>            sonorities are based on integer ratios, but melodic<br/>            steps and unstable sonorities typically or always<br/>            feature irrational ratios, as in tempered systems.</p><p>         3. (I)ntricacy. Like traditional (e.g. meantone)<br/>            temperaments, these &quot;adaptive JI&quot; systems are<br/>            designed in part precisely to avoid such<br/>            intricacies as the syntonic or septimal comma.</p><p>Thus while such schemes share a P property (e.g. Pstable for<br/>Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI system of 1555 with two manuals in 1/4-comma<br/>meantone tuned 1/4 syntonic comma apart) like that of classic PRI or<br/>PR systems, they exhibit a _partial_ R property often applying<br/>specifically to the subset of sonorities covered by the P property,<br/>and more specifically to the _vertical_ intervals of such sonorities.</p><p>For example, in Vicentino&apos;s system, while a vertical fifth of 3:2 in a<br/>sonority of 4:5:6 or 10:12:15 is pure, a melodic fifth is typically<br/>tempered. Also, unstable vertical sonorities such as a suspended c-f-g<br/>or C3-F3-G3 (simplest ratio 6:8:9), or a suspended or suspension-like<br/>c-g-a or C3-G3-A3 (simplest 2-3-5 ratio 10:15:18), may involve<br/>tempered vertical intervals.</p><p>In such a system, then, R as well as P applies to a subset of stable<br/>sonorities, and specifically to the _vertical_ intervals of such<br/>sonorities.</p><p>Possibly a notation like PRstable-vert might express such a system.</p><p>One might say that such &quot;adaptive JI&quot; systems are designed to preserve<br/>the P property while &quot;tempering&quot; the I property -- and a logical<br/>result of this compromise is the partial presence of R in a mixed<br/>environment of rational and irrational ratios.</p><p>-------------<br/>5. Conclusion<br/>-------------</p><p>Starting with the classic 2-3-5 JI model of the 16th century, I have<br/>sought to suggest that we may explore various permutations of the PRI<br/>properties which together make this model an &quot;ideal type&quot; for what<br/>people often imply by the term JI: pure vertical intervals, pervasive<br/>use of integer ratios, and intricate implementations on fixed-pitch<br/>instruments.</p><p>Other PRI schemes such as 2-3-5-7 or 2-3-7 JI also fit these musical<br/>implications of &quot;just intonation,&quot; albeit with often quite different<br/>musical specifics than those of Zarlino.</p><p>A Gothic or neo-Gothic PR scheme of 2-3 JI (Pythagorean intonation)<br/>also fits the properties of Purity (for stable sonorities) and<br/>Rationality (for all intervals), while at the same time constituting a<br/>regular tuning with less &quot;Intricacy.&quot;</p><p>An RI scheme based on complex rational ratios intricately ordered<br/>(possibly with an emphasis on melodic aspects), or a PI scheme based<br/>on Setharean spectra realized by intricate irrational ratios for<br/>maximal &quot;purity&quot; or sensory consonance, or a contingent (P)RI scheme<br/>where complex ratios have a &quot;pure&quot; effect in a setting of intricately<br/>structured sonorities (e.g. LaMonte Young), are other interpretations<br/>of &quot;JI&quot; which may have musical qualities distinctive from those of<br/>usual tempered systems.</p><p>&quot;Adaptive&quot; JI systems in the sense of PRstable-vert or the like<br/>resemble conventional PR or PRI systems in seeking purity, and regular<br/>temperaments in seeking to disperse or minimize intricacy, especially<br/>the kind of aural &quot;intricacy&quot; represented by syntonic or septimal<br/>comma shifts/drifts.</p><p>Since an exclusively integer-based tuning might approximate any<br/>regular temperament as closely as desired, and a regular temperament<br/>of arbitrarily large size might likewise approximate pure integer<br/>ratios as accurately as desired, a definition of &quot;JI&quot; in terms of<br/>rationality (R) or purity (P) alone may not be especially<br/>distinctive.</p><p>We might speak, for example, of an R-based &quot;quasi-temperament&quot; or an<br/>irrationally-based &quot;quasi-JI&quot; system: Kirnberger&apos;s approximation of<br/>12-tone equal temperament (12-tET) by a ratio for the fourth of<br/>10935:8192, for example; or 118-tET used to emulate a 2-3-5 JI system.</p><p>One way to approach such quasi-temperaments and quasi-JI systems is to<br/>say that the fine conceptual structure of the tuning falls in one<br/>category (Kirnberger&apos;s scheme as &quot;R-based JI,&quot; 118-tET as an<br/>irrational or logarithmic division of the octave), but its intended<br/>and audible musical application in another (Kirnberger&apos;s scheme as<br/>&quot;virtual 12-tET,&quot; 118-tET as &quot;virtual 2-3-5 JI&quot;).[4]</p><p>An advantage of the PRI approach is that it permits us to take a<br/>&quot;three-dimensional&quot; approach in explaining, for example, that while<br/>Kirnberger&apos;s scheme is R-based, it differs from more characteristic JI<br/>systems in being both non-P (no pure intervals) and non-I (no<br/>intricacy of the kind associated with PRI systems, but rather a<br/>regular structure for all practical purposes identical to 12-tET).</p><p>We can thus distinguish Kirnberger&apos;s &quot;virtual 12-tET&quot; not only from<br/>PRI or PR systems of JI, but from a non-P system of the RI variety<br/>with an intricate &quot;emmelic&quot; structure of integer ratios featuring<br/>commas, schismas, or the like.</p><p>This last example brings us to a very vital point made by Bill Alves,<br/>whose scholarship and graciousness alike served to impress it upon me<br/>in an earlier dialogue. Any model of &quot;JI&quot; based on the Western<br/>European evolution of this concept over the past 500 years or so is<br/>necessarily a culturally-specific one, and if used as a &quot;universal&quot;<br/>standard may distort and deprecate the nature of integer-based musics<br/>in other world cultures.</p><p>Complex &quot;emmelic&quot; JI systems focusing on melodic structure rather than<br/>vertical &quot;purity&quot; -- in the terms of our typology, RI systems --<br/>represent a different approach than that of Zarlino, as he himself<br/>acknowledges in distinguishing between &quot;ancient&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; styles.<br/>In his view, the &quot;ancient&quot; Greek style based essentially on one<br/>melodic line permits the artful use of the chromatic and enharmonic<br/>genera as well as the diatonic; but only the diatonic fits &quot;the modern<br/>style, with its multiplicity of parts, always seeking the perfect<br/>harmony.&quot;[5]</p><p>Thus the PRI approach, itself taking 16th-century Western European<br/>practice and theory as a starting point, might serve merely as one<br/>possible three-dimensional model for integer-based systems of music,<br/>inviting other models based on the specific structures and concepts of<br/>a variety of world musics.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. Gioseffo Zarlino, _The Art of Counterpoint: Part Three<br/>of Le Istitutioni harmoniche, 1558_, trans. Guy A. Marco and<br/>Claude Palisca (W. W. Norton, 1976), ISBN 0-393-00833-9, Chapter 17,<br/>at p. 35. Interestingly, Zarlino suggests that voices &quot;do tend to<br/>approximate more closely those instruments that are tuned to the<br/>Pythagorean steps, where these minute intervals are not present, than<br/>those that are perfectly tuned in accord with the perfection of the<br/>harmonic numbers.&quot; At the same time, he asserts that voices &quot;seek the<br/>perfection of intervals.&quot; One way to reconcile these two statements<br/>would be to posit a technique of &quot;adaptive JI&quot; of the kind described<br/>in Section 4 below; and scholars such as Paul Erlich have proposed<br/>such an adaptive model for polyphonic vocal intonation.</p><p>2. Ercole Bottrigari, _Il Desiderio, 1594_, trans. Carol MacClintock,<br/>Musical Studies and Documents 9 (American Institute of Musicology,<br/>1963), pp. 41-42. &quot;...[Y]our ears have never heard any consonances<br/>other than those of the Diapason in its true form; and are accustomed<br/>to hear those only as tempered, defective, and altered on all the<br/>stable and stable-alterable instruments.&quot;</p><p>3. Here I am much indebted to Joe Monzo for the insight that the<br/>concept of &quot;perfect&quot; intonation or JI seems to emerge in Western<br/>European theory along with the concept of temperament, both concepts<br/>addressing the intonation of Renaissance sonorities combining<br/>incommensurable ratios of 3 and 5.</p><p>4. For the example of 118-tET as a &quot;virtual 2-3-5 JI system,&quot; I am<br/>indebted to Dave Keenan.</p><p>5. Zarlino, n. 1 above, Chapter 74, p. 272. Here Zarlino is<br/>specifically rejecting the adaptation of all three Greek genera to<br/>modern polyphonic practice as advocated by Nicola Vicentino, with<br/>prominent use of the chromatic semitone and the enharmonic diesis of<br/>approximately 1/5-tone (e.g. the diesis G#-Ab in 1/4-comma meantone at<br/>128:125 or ~41.06 cents). While this judgment may be most debatable,<br/>Zarlino&apos;s recognition that 16th-century Western European polyphony is<br/>not necessarily a universal standard for music or intonation deserves<br/>appreciation.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>12/26/2000 3:51:59 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- &quot;M.

The brilliance of these categorizations,<br/>is that it allows one to clearly see and identify the use of these<br/>facets of Rational Intonation, which may be at work within a given<br/>composer&apos;s style (as we know, the contemporary meaning of JI seems to<br/>have leapt off the pages of the OED, and went running off on a<br/>mission of its own!). This could only come from someone in possession<br/>of many profound years of experience of active practice and<br/>performance with tunings.

Rationality and Intricacy: Complex RI systems<br/>&gt; --------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here it should be noted that radical RI systems, as described for<br/>&gt; example by Jacky Ligon, might focus especially on _melodic_ aspects<br/>of<br/>&gt; integer-based music. The ancient Greek interest in superparticular<br/>&gt; melodic intervals, for example semitones of 16:15 or 28:27, may<br/>&gt; provide a time-honored precedent for this type of JI approach, with<br/>a<br/>&gt; focus on _emmeles_ or &quot;intervals apt for melodic progressions.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for introducing me to this term: &quot;emmeles&quot;. Now I know what to<br/>call it!</p><p>One of the most prolific and experienced microtonal composers I know,<br/>basically told me that the most important and primal thing about<br/>music is also the most difficult to categorize and qualify in<br/>mathematical terms - &quot;MELODY&quot;. And if one thinks about it, they will<br/>see it&apos;s true. Melody being the very soul of music (and &quot;Intricacy&quot;<br/>for that matter), is something that can&apos;t be explained fully or<br/>easily by means of harmonic theory. Obviously, what looks good on<br/>paper may not always work in a musical setting - and moreover, what<br/>works melodically, may be lacking in harmonic properties and visa<br/>versa. It has taken many years for my ears to climb to the<br/>appreciation of higher primes and complexities, and the mother-load<br/>of pure gold that I&apos;ve found is in the melodic realm.</p><p>Something interesting, is that I demonstrated to my guests this<br/>weekend, everything from Pythagorean, to O-U Hybrids, to maddeningly<br/>high prime scales, and we all agreed that it is important to grasp<br/>the concept that RI structures can generally be optimized for melody<br/>or harmony - this is my native tongue. Some high prime scales I<br/>played on our new TX802 timbre, to show nakedly what the harmonic<br/>attributes of the tuning were (some didn&apos;t reach the Keenanian 50%!),<br/>but when they would be used melodically on a real flute sample<br/>(oxymoron of the day!), it was wonderful! I think it&apos;s important to<br/>embrace both of the poles, from &quot;P&quot; to &quot;I&quot;.</p><p>&gt; -------------<br/>&gt; 5. Conclusion<br/>&gt; -------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Complex &quot;emmelic&quot; JI systems focusing on melodic structure rather<br/>than<br/>&gt; vertical &quot;purity&quot; -- in the terms of our typology, RI systems --<br/>&gt; represent a different approach than that of Zarlino, as he himself<br/>&gt; acknowledges in distinguishing between &quot;ancient&quot; and &quot;modern&quot;<br/>styles.<br/>&gt; In his view, the &quot;ancient&quot; Greek style based essentially on one<br/>&gt; melodic line permits the artful use of the chromatic and enharmonic<br/>&gt; genera as well as the diatonic; but only the diatonic fits &quot;the<br/>modern<br/>&gt; style, with its multiplicity of parts, always seeking the perfect<br/>&gt; harmony.&quot;[5]</p><p>It&apos;s more than a little fascinating to realize the antiquity of the<br/>knowledge of how to navigate the higher primes and complexities. No<br/>doubt we come culturally from the harmonic side of things being<br/>emphasized. Being culturally conditioned to harmony should not become<br/>a barrier to appreciation of &quot;I&quot; melody.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>P.S. I should add - and also with deepest possible insight, my friend<br/>pointed out that you never hear anyone humming or whistling chord<br/>progressions.

Purity (P). A fixed-pitch instrument in a JI tuning<br/>&gt;             presents consonant intervals in their most &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>&gt;             or &quot;sonorous&quot; form.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          2. Rationality (R). A JI tuning is based on integer<br/>&gt;             ratios, especially those of Zarlino&apos;s _senario_<br/>&gt;             (the natural numbers 1-6), in contrast to the<br/>&gt;             irrational ratios of temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;          3. Intricacy/Incommensurability (I). A JI tuning,<br/>&gt;             unlike either the older Pythagorean tuning or<br/>&gt;             a meantone temperament, is not regular, but<br/>&gt;             involves such intervals as the syntonic comma<br/>&gt;             resulting from what has been termed the<br/>&gt;             &quot;incommensurate&quot; nature of prime factors<br/>&gt;             such as 3 and 5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All three themes emerge in 16th-century discussions of just tuning<br/>and temperament.</p><p>Congratulations to Margo Schulter for lending a little &quot;historical<br/>background&quot; to the recent discussion on just intonation.  I suppose<br/>it shouldn&apos;t be too surprising that many of these concepts have been<br/>considered by great thinkers for centuries... we certainly have no<br/>&quot;monopoly&quot; on brainpower in our age... although having different<br/>tools.</p><p>In addition to this background which is, essentially, humbling for<br/>practically everybody, I found the following paragraph particularly<br/>instructive:</p><p>&gt; Since an exclusively integer-based tuning might approximate any<br/>&gt; regular temperament as closely as desired, and a regular temperament<br/>&gt; of arbitrarily large size might likewise approximate pure integer<br/>&gt; ratios as accurately as desired, a definition of &quot;JI&quot; in terms of<br/>&gt; rationality (R) or purity (P) alone may not be especially<br/>&gt; distinctive.</p><p>This, of course, was the basic gist of the JI &quot;argument&quot; and it was<br/>instructive to find we were missing a third possible &quot;dimension&quot; the<br/>&quot;I&quot; (Incommensurability) of Ms. Schulter&apos;s three-dimensional model.</p><p>Thanks again for expanding the boundaries of this discussion!<br/>________ _____ ___ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
