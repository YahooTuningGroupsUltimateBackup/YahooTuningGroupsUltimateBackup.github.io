So even at four months &quot;universality&quot; testing is not possible. If<br/>we test to compare tritones to perfect intervals, the test it self is a culturally biased<br/>question. It would be the equivalent of an African test 12 beat bell patterns against 16 as a<br/>way of determining that the former was more pleasing. Also a child at four months cannot<br/>answer for them selves, in other words, their reactions are being guessed. The question is<br/>just how far can science go in answering the questions of Art. Personally I think about as<br/>good as the opposite. Both can be helpful and express possibilities but nothing more. I<br/>believe Einstein said he personally got the notion of an expanding universe from the &quot;Jupiter&quot;<br/>symphony.</p><p>&quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kraig, in an earlier post you raised the concern, in testing performed<br/>&gt; on babies, that the prejudices of the tester could distort the results.<br/>&gt; I very much agree that such a possibility exists.  But it is also true<br/>&gt; that methodologies exist to deal effectively with such problems.  For<br/>&gt; example: the babies could be played a series of tones and a videotape<br/>&gt; made showing time and the babies&apos; responses.  Another researcher, who<br/>&gt; does not know the order of the tones played, could view the videotape<br/>&gt; with the sound removed, and record the babies&apos; reactions only against<br/>&gt; elapsed time.  Such methods sharply reduce the likelihood of prejudicial<br/>&gt; distortions of the results.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I&apos;m following exactly the points you&apos;re making, you seem to reject<br/>&gt; any possibility of a universal response among babies from different<br/>&gt; parts of the world.  Though I&apos;m far from certain, my guess is that you<br/>&gt; are mistaken on this point.  Finding the true results is the point of<br/>&gt; research, yes?  It seems likely to me that babies may be more consistent<br/>&gt; than adults when it comes to their reactions, since they&apos;ve had less<br/>&gt; time to build cultural perspectives.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can we at least agree that it&apos;s an open question, and that further<br/>&gt; research might shed some interesting light?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JdL<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; .</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=11273 href="#11273">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
