However, there is still beating in the 12-22t-ET version...<br/>&gt;slower.  Is this good enough, or should I be finding a patch where there<br/>&gt;is NO beating in the 12-22??</p><p>Joseph, only JI would give you the impression of NO beating. Remember,<br/>22-tET does a lot better than 12-tET for four of the six intervals in the<br/>dominant seventh chord, but the tritone is just as bad, and the fifth is<br/>worse.</p><p>&gt;In Example 2, the &quot;half diminished seventh&quot; mirror Eb-Gb-A-Db, I seem to<br/>&gt;be getting similar beating in both the 12t-ET and 12-22t-ET versions...<br/>&gt;However, the 12-22t-ET version seems &quot;flatter&quot; somehow... it seems like<br/>&gt;it&apos;s the &quot;A.&quot; (??)</p><p>It is just a little bit flatter -- that&apos;s just because of the particular<br/>cents deviations of the tuning, isn&apos;t it -- it might make for a better<br/>comparison if you transposed it up 10 cents or more.</p></div><h3>Paul H.

This timbre is OK for comparing the dominant<br/>seventh chords, since harmonic entropy, and roughness between combination<br/>tones, will be audibly greater for the 12-tET version. But it is a<br/>particularly poor timbre for the purpose of investigating the &quot;subharmonic&quot;<br/>or &quot;mirror&quot; version of the dominant seventh chord, since there are no 3rd,<br/>5th, or 7th partials to beat against one another.</p><p>&gt;Also, resolution of the &apos;z, 768 steps to the octave, will generate<br/>&gt;noticeable beating in intervals that are meant to be just.</p><p>That&apos;s OK -- it&apos;s good enough for comparing 12-tET to 22-tET.</p></div>
