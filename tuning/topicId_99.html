Equal temperament may be mathematically &apos;perfect&apos;, but it is not<br/>pleasing to the ear.  Guitar builders have tried various methods to improve<br/>the guitar&apos;s intonation, but none of these methods produced truely<br/>gorgeous, specacular intonation... until now.&quot;</p><p>The ad went on to say absolutely nothing as to how this was achieved.<br/>Besides a few small photos, the ad contained two large, brightly-colored<br/>blocks filled with bold text.  One said,</p><p>&quot;BUZZ&quot;</p><p>The other said,</p><p>&quot;We care about tuning so you don&apos;t have to.&quot;</p><p>I don&apos;t think anybody needs to write to anybody about this Buzz thing.<br/>Those involved assert that they do not care about tuning, or appeal to<br/>those who do not.  In either case it means they have no credibility as<br/>musicians.</p><p>Carl</p></div><h3>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@bellsouth.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/4/1999 4:07:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wonder boy Carl --my real stress is something generated by this tuning list.<br/>I did not mean to pronounce anything deceased. as I have several of the<br/>Xenaharmonikon Archives from the SEJIC as you know as ell as all the<br/>1/1s,which I cherish. What I really mean is when was the last time you went<br/>to any &quot;normal store&quot;  and saw a valid JI/Modern theory periodical save for<br/>maybe --Wire? Ps the december Wire #178 has a twelve page article with the<br/>Grandaddy of Minimalism LaMonte Young. I had the great pleasure in November<br/>of visiting his &amp; Marion&apos;s Dream House and got to experience The Base<br/>Symmetry in Prime Time When Centered above and below The Lowest Primes in<br/>the Range 288 to 224 with the addition of 279 and 261 in Which The Half of<br/>the Symmetric Division Mapped above and including 288 Consists of the Powers<br/>of 2 multiplied by the Primes within The Ranges of 144 to128,72 to 64 and 36<br/>to 32 Which are symmetrical to Those Primes in the Lowest Terms in The Half<br/>of thge Symmetric division Mapped below and including 224 within the ranges<br/>126 to 112,63 to 56 and 31.5 to 28 with the addition of 119. It was<br/>phenomenal. Has anyone else visited the Dream House? I also got a chance to<br/>chat with the wonderful David Beardsley who monitors the installation and is<br/>a vast fount of knowledge in his own right. Vist him at Juxtaposititon E<br/>zine. Carl email me your snail I have recording of the LiPo covers we did as<br/>well as the jam w/denny.
