Something I have done a bit of experimentation with in<br/>the past is to create tempo chords in midi sequenced compositions.<br/>Since Tempo can be looked at as &quot;frequency&quot; it is possible to use<br/>ratios of tempos in the same way one would use them for pitch. In the<br/>simplest sense 60 BPM being 1/1 - 120 BPM being 2/1 etc... Perhaps<br/>this is something you already employ in your compositions?</p><p>In another altogether different way, it is also important to consider<br/>polymeters - and phasing between a number of simultaneous meters. I<br/>have also worked with combining many prime meters at once (5/8, 7/8,<br/>11/8 and 13/8 - for example), each playing on various timbres - and<br/>passing these timbres alternately to the other poly-metrical<br/>rhythmic &quot;strata&quot;. Since in this scenario all are playing at the same<br/>tempo - to me there is less of a &quot;chordal&quot; correlation with<br/>polymeters. You get more of a sense of cycles phasing against one<br/>another, than the chordal tempo effect of slow and fast rhythms<br/>happening in juxtaposition.</p><p>As to whether or not human perception can follow passed 17, I&apos;ve<br/>found it&apos;s all about conditioning and the chosen context for such a<br/>long cycle. If you work with anything and hear it long enough, it&apos;ll<br/>become a valid part of practice.</p><p>I love to work in prime meters - there is nothing like the &quot;feel&quot; it<br/>adds to a piece. I think that the shackles of &quot;primes than 2 and 3&quot;<br/>are kind of like 12 tET sometimes.</p><p>Thanks for the thought provoking post,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Mats &nbsp;&nbsp;&Ouml;ljare&quot; &lt;oljare@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&nbsp;&nbsp;&acute;ve been wondering recently if there is a direct parallel<br/>between<br/>prime<br/>&gt; ratios in pitches and in rhythm.&gt;<br/>&gt; While 11/8 and 13/8 meters can be difficult to play even for those<br/>who are<br/>&gt; used to them(indeed,most Western music do not contain any meters<br/>with higher<br/>&gt; primes than 2 and 3)they can be played,and most certainly&quot;felt&quot;in a<br/>way<br/>&gt; where they become a naturally flowing rhytmic cycle.The former,for<br/>&gt; example,when used in Balkan music,is often percieved as a extended<br/>cycle of<br/>&gt; five beats(2,3,2,2,2).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While meters like 17 and 19 can be built up in the same way of<br/>shorter and<br/>&gt; longer sub-cycles,they simply refuse to&quot;flow&quot;in the way the<br/>previously<br/>&gt; mentioned meters does(a subjective experience.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Although i can learn to play it,it just doesn&nbsp;&nbsp;&acute;t&quot;feel&quot;in the way<br/>13<br/>and lower<br/>&gt; prime meters does.I always thought of higher numbered meters being<br/>more<br/>&gt; complex than others,but i never before considered it as a prime<br/>factor<br/>&gt; thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My idea is not that there is a distinct limit to human<br/>&gt; perception(indeed,some Indian and Indonesian music use very long<br/>cycles)but<br/>&gt; rather that one should consider the complexity of a meter to be<br/>dependant<br/>&gt; upon prime factorisation rather than the sheer value of the<br/>number.For<br/>&gt; example,21 is not a prime.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;<br/>&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&raquo;&raquo;<br/>&gt; Mats &nbsp;&nbsp;&Ouml;ljare<br/>&gt; Eskilstuna,Sweden<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mo/oljare">http://www.angelfire.com/mo/oljare</a><br/>&gt;<br/>______________________________________________________________________<br/>__<br/>&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at<br/><a href="http://www.hotmail.com">http://www.hotmail.com</a></p></div><h3>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2000 7:19:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, jacky_ekstasis@y... wrote:<br/>&gt; Mats,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; IMO there is more of a correlation between &quot;ratios of tempos&quot;, to<br/>&gt; that of &quot;ratios of pitch&quot;, than there is in considering just single<br/>&gt; meters alone.

Perhaps<br/>&gt; this is something you already employ in your compositions?</p><p>We might also mention, in light of the conversation with Jacky and<br/>Banaphshu, that you both certainly will recall the &quot;biggest&quot; of such<br/>harmonic-rhythmic spectral efforts, Stockhausen&apos;s _Gruppen_.</p><p>The article that &quot;explains&quot; Gruppen appears in Issue III of _die<br/>Reihe_, the wonderful, but short-lived German publication that<br/>follows<br/>the Boulez-Stockhausen-Webern post-serial schools, an article<br/>called &quot;Musical Craftsmanship.&quot;</p><p>The &quot;unified field theory&quot; of this approach is clearly explained by<br/>Stockhausen right at the beginning of the article:</p><p>&quot;Our sense perception divides acoustically-perceptible phases into<br/>two<br/>groups; we speak of DURATIONS and PITCHES.  This becomes clear if we<br/>steadily shorten the length of a phase (e.g. that between two<br/>impulses) from 1&quot; to 1/2&quot;, to 1/4&quot; ... etc.  Until a phase-duration<br/>of<br/>approx. 1/16&quot;, we can still just hear the impulses separately;  until<br/>then, we speak of &apos;durations,&apos; if of one that becomes extremely<br/>short.<br/>Shorten the phase-duration gradually to 1/32&quot;, and the impulses are<br/>no<br/>longer separately perceptible; one can no longer speak of the<br/>&apos;duration&apos; of the phase.  The latter process becomes perceptible,<br/>rather, in a different way: one perceives the phase-duration as the<br/>&apos;pitch&apos; of the sound...  Thus the transition from one time-area to<br/>another causes a change in our perception of phases.  This<br/>observation<br/>could form the basis of a new morphology of musical time...&quot;</p><p>Stockhausen goes on to develop a system of what he calls &quot;formants&quot;<br/>or<br/>rhythmic pulses that consist of the ascending series of whole numbers<br/>which also correspond to the harmonic series... i.e., obviously,<br/>instruments will be performing at the same time a unit of 1, 2, 3, 4,<br/>5, etc., in the _Gruppen_ texture.</p><p>Interestingly enough, this is a very similar procedure used by<br/>Charles<br/>Ives in his Universe Symphony and due to the fine efforts of Johnny<br/>Reinhard, we are beginning to get a glimmer of Ives real interest in<br/>acoustic matters and intonation.  The Ives, of course, would pre-date<br/>the Stockhausen by some time... but I believe the &quot;discovery&quot; was<br/>independently formulated by Stockhausen... I&apos;m pretty sure he<br/>wouldn&apos;t<br/>have seen drafts of the Ives Universe Symphony...(??)</p><p>In any case, I was startled to find that Stockhausen also derives<br/>durations by using the SUBHARMONIC series... and he has a UTONAL<br/>rhythmic scheme in _Gruppen_ as well.</p><p>Stockhausen states:  &quot;In comparison with a scale built on chromatic<br/>intervals, the subharmonic scale is a MODE.  The composer Messiaen<br/>was<br/>well aware of this when he characterised such scalse as &apos;modes&quot; in<br/>his<br/>fourth _Study_ for piano...</p><p>Anybody know more about Messiaen and the subharmonic series<br/>scales??... I would be very interested!!</p><p>In an additional description of his &quot;formant spectrum,&quot; Stockhausen<br/>continues:</p><p>&quot;Because the fundamental phase serves as the unit of perception, the<br/>divided values are always referred to it.  Thus the fractions must<br/>always repeat themselves until they reach the total fundamental<br/>value. There are two halves, three thirds, etc, to one fundamental<br/>phase.  We define such a formation as a HARMONIC PHASE-SPECTRUM, BOTH<br/>when it applies to micro-phase (pitch) and macro-phases (durations).&quot;</p><p>It might be also interesting to consider that these overlapping<br/>rhythmic relations and phases are certainly pre-dated by such<br/>oriental<br/>musics as the Gamelan...  I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t know too much about the<br/>subject... I know some list members do.  I guess the question is<br/>whether Gamelan music follows small integer relationships in the<br/>overlapping rhythmic patterns.  That&apos;s an easy one for somebody.<br/>Thanks!</p><p>____________ _____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>phv40@hotmail.com</h3><span>8/21/2000 7:58:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Mats &Ouml;ljare&quot; &lt;oljare@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I&acute;ve been wondering recently if there is a direct parallel<br/>between<br/>prime<br/>&gt; ratios in pitches and in rhythm.</p><p>I have a couple of CDs by Ben Neill.

I&apos;m glad you added &apos;a subjective experience&apos; to your<br/>description, because it doesn&apos;t hold for me.</p><p>I&apos;ve been a big fan of Bulgarian folk music, much of which uses<br/>complex asymmetrical meters like 11/8 and 13/8.  But my introduction<br/>to this music was thru a piece by jazz trumpeter Don Ellis, called<br/>&apos;Bulgarian Bulge&apos;, which is in 31/16.</p><p>(You can read a bit about this in my autobiography:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/bio/bio.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/bio/bio.htm</a></p><p>There&apos;s a link to a webpage loaded with info about Ellis, and<br/>another link to a video excerpt that didn&apos;t work when I tried<br/>it just now.)</p><p>Ellis&apos;s band plays the 31/16 flawlessly and with a lot of swing.<br/>I&apos;d like to know how other listeners familiar with this tune<br/>would respond to your comments.</p><p>&apos;Bulgarian Bulge&apos; was a real eye-opener for me, not primarily<br/>because of the interest it sparked in the folk music, but because<br/>the speed at which the band plays the tune made me realize that<br/>we can perceive very complex meters as series of smaller chunks<br/>made up of either 2 or 3 beats.</p><p>In this particular tune, those 2- or 3-beat units are built up<br/>in various different combinations into larger pieces made of<br/>7 or 8 beats, which are in turn paired off into 15- and 16-beat<br/>units, which finally are paired to produce the 31-beat unit of<br/>a single measure.  With such a long and complex structure, each<br/>single measure is like a phrase.</p><p>Since then, I&apos;ve been inspired to use this type of construction<br/>in a lot of my own tunes, but I&apos;ve never quite approached the<br/>complexity of this Ellis tune.</p><p>Primes are particularly of interest to me, considering the role<br/>they seem to play in my harmonic theories.  But my personal feeling<br/>about meters is that their full unit measurements don&apos;t compare<br/>as prime-factor _gestalts_ they way harmonic prime-factors do<br/>(or seem to, as a template into which we fit our perception of<br/>more complicated proportions).  It seems to me that any metrical<br/>structure can be, and is, perceived as series of 2- and 3-beat<br/>units.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
