It was<br/>designed for high end video games and has all the bells and whistles.  Here&apos;s<br/>some of the things that it can do that relate to the idea:<br/>+Full 3d engine programming interface for graphics and audio (doppler<br/>effects, too).<br/>+High speed user input from any input device.<br/>+Has interfaces for audio files including wave, midi and DirectMusic files.<br/>+DirectMusic files can be composed to be interactive/dynamic and use the DLS<br/>standard put forth by the MMA.<br/>+Based on the Component Object Model and is very fast.<br/>+Boatload of soundcards and video adapters with DirectX hardware accelerators<br/>built in<br/>+Currently up to release 8 and well established in the MS-Windows OS.</p><p>Microsoft is doing great things with the DirectX programming interface.<br/>DirectMusic for example is blowing me away and that is only a small<br/>subsection of the whole kit)</p><p>A really good program could be written using DirectX.</p><p>regards,<br/>Andy</p></div><h3><a id=18987 href="#18987">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>2/18/2001 10:27:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., AMiltonF@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know how much everybody knows about DirectX but it could be<br/>the<br/>&gt; easiest way to implement the new Dekany thoughts going around.</p><p>I think this is a great idea.

It gives you super fast access to the video card.<br/>Fast enough to to do this flipping thing where you have image A on the screen<br/>and you&apos;ve got image B being prepared, then, faster than the refresh rate, it<br/>swaps the two.  All controlled with a high level coding interface.  If I<br/>understand you correctly it&apos;s ideal!</p><p>regards,<br/>Andy</p></div>
