When I teach blues, I can show a student just where I want them to bend a note by feel/sound, but I don&apos;t intellectually know the ratios...and it&apos;s not an easy thing for most folks to do, in fact, I would say that playing deep blues is one of the most difficult art forms on the planet, precisely because there&apos;s so many variables...you can&apos;t tell someone how to do it for themselves, you can only point the way and hope they fill in the blanks. I&apos;ve known a lot of accomplished musicians over the years who, unfortunately, turn their noses up just a bit at blues, thinking it&apos;s easy cause of the deceptive simplicity of the form (and this includes rockabilly, country, and other &quot;simple&quot; forms of Americana as well)..these folks never play these forms well, even thought they may think they can...cause they don&apos;t understand the inner workings, the subtle microtonal inflections tonally, as well as the microtonal rhythmic things that are going on. Jimi Hendrix was a master at bending and playing incredibly difficult rhythmic phrases...Joe Gore once transcribed one of his &quot;Red House&quot; solos, and talked about how terribly difficult is was to use notation for his licks...I actually don&apos;t see the point, and would go so far to say that someone who reads a Hendrix solo and then attempts to play it, will never get the exact feel...it would be much easier, if easy is the right word, just to cop the licks by ear.<br/>  Flamencos and blues players have often commented on the difficulty of notating those forms, and I agree...feeling and emulating the maestros is the best way to learn &quot;folk&quot;
