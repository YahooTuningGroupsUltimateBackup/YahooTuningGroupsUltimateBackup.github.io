The supposed<br/>&gt; cross-platform Java programing language that<br/>&gt; this applet is written in - works in the browser<br/>&gt; distributed by the Evil Empire (aka Microsoft Explorer)<br/>&gt; but not in my user friendly Netscape.</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>I use a lot of products which emanate from the Evil Empire,<br/>so some of my stuff is bound to embody their shortcomings.</p><p>Actually, Ming sent this to me months ago, and<br/>while it was residing only on my own hard-drive it<br/>did some weird things too.  A few times, when I copied<br/>it into my main lattice webpage, it failed to appear<br/>in my browser at all!</p><p>Hope you can get it working.</p><p>PS - hope your concert was a success, Dave.  Sorry I missed it,<br/>but I&apos;ve been working night and day on that Euler translation.<br/>Soon, very soon...</p><p>99% of it is finished, but there are some fine points<br/>in the translations of the Latin that I want to iron out.</p><p>Joseph L. <a href="mailto:Monzo....................monz@juno.com">Monzo....................monz@juno.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p> |&quot;...I had broken thru the lattice barrier...&quot;|<br/> |                            - Erv Wilson     |</p><p>___________________________________________________________________<br/>You don&apos;t need to buy Internet access to use free Internet e-mail.<br/>Get completely free e-mail from Juno at <a href="http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html">http://www.juno.com/getjuno.html</a><br/>or call Juno at (800) 654-JUNO [654-5866]</p></div>
