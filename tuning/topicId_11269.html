Oops!</p><p>This easy and incorrect association may reflect my unfamiliarity both<br/>with the intonational structure of pelog -- which I&apos;ve heard and<br/>liked -- and with the theory of tunings where diatonic semitones can<br/>be larger than whole-tones, so to speak.</p><p>Pelog I recall as a kind of 5-note mode (typically from a 7-note<br/>tuning or gamut, as I now understand) suggesting to me as an<br/>ethnocentric first impression something like a &quot;Phrygian variation of<br/>pentatonic,&quot; e.g. E-F-G-B-C-E. Looking at a few pelog scales in Scala<br/>has educated me a bit on this, thanks to your helpful correction.</p><p>Maybe you could enlarge a bit on the different n-tet approximations.<br/>From a psychological point of view, might this be an instance where a<br/>tuning maybe not actually within Blackwood&apos;s criteria of &quot;diatonic<br/>recognizability&quot; can nevertheless give a listener coming from a<br/>certain cultural bias the impression of something recognizing a<br/>diatonic European mode like Phrygian, where both whole-tones and<br/>diatonic semitones are present?</p><p>Even with my crude understanding of pelog, of course, I should have<br/>figured out that 7-tet wouldn&apos;t have enough sizes of intervals to<br/>represent it.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
