and &apos;pitch&apos; when a musical instrument plays a note,<br/>would be a bit confused by this chord. i decided to try it out for<br/>myself, and since the human voice, brass, reed, and bowed string<br/>instrument timbres consist of partials in an exact harmonic series, i<br/>used such a timbre. i hear it as the 7th, 8th, and 9th of an implied<br/>root -- try looping the .wav and humming the root you hear -- i think<br/>you might agree. the &apos;first inversion&apos; of this chord would thus sound<br/>more &apos;rooted&apos; and &apos;final&apos;. thus music composed &apos;on paper&apos; with this<br/>system might not work out quite as intended &apos;in the ear&apos;.</p><p>i&apos;m tempted to fill in the big hole in the chord, especially if voice<br/>leading is a consideration, and the scale unfortunately provides for<br/>this endeavor, at least not for the &apos;tonic&apos; chord in this instance. i<br/>tried playing the triad along with all the additional notes from 19-<br/>equal, and the ones that fit by far the best (the effect is really<br/>striking) are not in the scale above. you should try this yourself.<br/>as you can infer from my paper, i like my tonal analogues to the<br/>diatonic scale to act rather differently from this.</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2002 7:39:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;
