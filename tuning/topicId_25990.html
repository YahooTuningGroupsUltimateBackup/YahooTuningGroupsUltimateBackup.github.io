It was a really unforgetable experience, since it was a<br/>superb performance of extremely pleasantly exotic music. Though it was<br/>generally simple in &quot;construction&quot; -- the choirs being divided into two<br/>voices, with one voice singing the drone and the other singing the melody --<br/>it was actually a very rich sounding consort, since the melodic voice<br/>produced not only a variety of melodic figures, mostly in minor (including<br/>Dorian and Phrygian) modes, but also an assortment of interesting microtonal<br/>and alternate termperament results, including some distinct &quot;smaller than<br/>semitone&quot; intervals and other sonorities sounding &quot;out of tune&quot; to the<br/>untuned ear. The Byzantine music was rather &quot;classical&quot; and more ascetic,<br/>having more limitations to distinctly set modes (though the microtonal and<br/>&quot;out-of-tune&quot; singing could be very well heard here too!), while the Serb<br/>singing, which is actually supposed to be a branch of the Byzantine music<br/>(i.e. generally speaking, Byzantine music in Serbia) was actually much more<br/>rich harmonically and melodically, being almost intoxicating in its<br/>emotional effect on the audience, utilizing at different times just about<br/>all the notes of the chromatic spectrum and often having a distinctly Middle<br/>Eastern flavor - though some specialists told me that this was not Turkish<br/>influence, but the original singing in the area - what we now consider as<br/>&quot;Eastern music&quot; was the inherent original music in Greece and the Balkans<br/>(if not in even more Western areas of Europe). The amazing thing, is that<br/>it&apos;s totally different from Russian or Ukrainian church music, whether of<br/>the old or new type. Bulgarian music is supposed to sound like this too,<br/>though, unfortunately, I haven&apos;t heard any of it yet.<br/>After the concert, I talked to some of the chorus members and specialists in<br/>this music, staying around after the concert, and they told me that in this<br/>tradition the singers actually sing from the Medieval neumes (which means<br/>that I can&apos;t read it) and that the written music is quite diatonic (if there<br/>are chromaticisms notated, they are of the ordinary type), while the<br/>microtonalisms and alternate temperation is achieved by improvisational<br/>means, due to the inherent singing tradition, passed manually, so they don&apos;t<br/>have -23 or +37 or -49 notated in the scores (as I naively hoped that they<br/>would). I wonder if anyone here would know what kind of temperaments do<br/>singers of the area use and whether this improvisational element with adding<br/>of microtonal intervals is used much among different traditions of folk or<br/>religious singing, whether in Europe or Asia or around the world. This is<br/>something which crossed my mind after the concert.</p></div><h3><a id=25991 href="#25991">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2000 2:37:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Ant &lt;<a href="mailto:ant@df.ru">ant@df.ru</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 03, 2001 1:16 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Byzantine and Serb Church Music<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; After the concert, I talked to some of the chorus members and specialists<br/>in<br/>&gt; this music, staying around after the concert, and they told me that in<br/>this<br/>&gt; tradition the singers actually sing from the Medieval neumes (which means<br/>&gt; that I can&apos;t read it) and that the written music is quite diatonic (if<br/>there<br/>&gt; are chromaticisms notated, they are of the ordinary type), while the<br/>&gt; microtonalisms and alternate temperation is achieved by improvisational<br/>&gt; means, due to the inherent singing tradition, passed manually, so they<br/>don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have -23 or +37 or -49 notated in the scores (as I naively hoped that they<br/>&gt; would).

(I don&apos;t have my copy of &quot;Divisions of the Tetrachord&quot;<br/>handy). I ordered some Byzantine CDs from Amazon (they only had a few<br/>in stock -- most are listed as hard to get) plus some John Tavener to<br/>get an idea what this sort of music sounds like. As I think I<br/>mentioned the other day, Volume 2 of &quot;The New Oxford History of<br/>Music&quot; has a rather extensive treatment of Byzantine music, including<br/>some information on the neumes. They actually represent *intervals*<br/>rather than absolute pitches IIRC.</p><p>As an aside, at one point in my life (age 13, of course :-) I learned<br/>the &quot;traditional&quot; Ashkenazic cantillation for the Haftorah.<br/>The &quot;melody&quot; is written over the Hebrew syllables in special symbols,<br/>each of which translates into roughly what we&apos;d call in Western music<br/>a &quot;motif&quot; -- a group of two, three or four notes. About all I<br/>remember is a few of the motifs and the fact that as a whole, the<br/>melody was in what we would call a minor key.</p><p>The motifs were actually written out in conventional Western music<br/>notation in some of the prayer books, and I was able to play them on<br/>the flute and thus get the melodies down. You can probably find the<br/>same information in a good Jewish bookstore today. I didn&apos;t know<br/>about microtonality back in those days, and of course, an American<br/>band flute is going to give you 12-TET pitches (at least, it&apos;s<br/>*supposed* to) so I probably missed the opportunity to sing<br/>microtonally at my Bar Mitzvah. :-) In those days, I could carry a<br/>tune, though. :-)</p><p>I have no idea how far back this kind of music goes. I always assumed<br/>it was no older than, say, the Middle Ages, when the Ashkenazim<br/>became a recognizable and distinct culture in Germany.

The whole discussion runs<br/>from pages 183 - 194; I can&apos;t possibly post the whole thing, but I&apos;ve<br/>extracted the highlight:</p><p>&quot;Structure of Ancient Music&quot;</p><p>&quot;I believe we can go further and affirm that ancient music, at least<br/>up to the first centuries of Christianity, was not based at all on<br/>scales and modes related to the octave, but on tetrachords and<br/>_systems_.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is what the Greeks used in their music: a hierarchic structure<br/>that proceeded by successive &apos;nesting,&apos; and by intersections from the<br/>particular to the general; we can trace its main outline if we follow<br/>the writings of Aristoxenos:&quot;</p><p>&quot;A. The _primary order_ consists of the tone and its subdivisions.&quot;</p><p>&quot;B. The _secondary order_ consists of the tetrachord.&quot; Xenakis then<br/>goes on to describe tetrachords, which I&apos;m sure are familiar to most<br/>of you.</p><p>&quot;C. The _tertiary order_, or _system_, is essentially a combination<br/>of the elements of the first two -- tones and tetrachords either<br/>conjuncted or separated by a tone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;D. The _quaternary order_ consists of the tropes, the keys, or the<br/>modes, which were probably just particularizations of the systems,<br/>derived by means of cadential, melodic, dominant, registral, and<br/>other formulae, as in Byzantine music, ragas, etc.</p><p>&quot;These orders account for the outside-time structure of Hellenic<br/>music.&quot;</p><p>Xenakis then goes on to describe arithmetic versus geometric<br/>proportion, another subject I&apos;m sure is familiar enough. &quot;Over the<br/>centuries the two languages -- arithmetic (operating by addition) and<br/>geometric (derived from the ratios of string lengths, and operating<br/>by multiplication) -- have always intermingled and interpenetrated so<br/>as to create much useless confusion in the reckoning of intervals and<br/>consonances, and consequently in theories.&quot; Then he gives a<br/>description of Byzantine music:</p><p>&quot;Byzantine music amalgamates the two means of calculation, the<br/>Pythagorean and the Aristoxenean, the multiplicative and the<br/>additive. ... the musical architecture is hierarchical and &apos;nested&apos;<br/>as in Aristoxenos, as follows:&quot;</p><p>&quot;A.&grave;The _primary order_ is based on the three tones 9/8, 10/9, 16/15,<br/>a supermajor tone 7/6, the trihemitone 6/5, another major tone 15/14,<br/>the semitone or leima 256/243, the apotome of the minor tone 135/128,<br/>and finally the comma 81/80. This complexity results from the mixture<br/>of the two means of calculation.</p><p>&quot;B. The _secondary order_ consists of tetrachords, as defined in<br/>Aristoxenos, and similarly the pentachords and the octochords. The<br/>tetrachords are divided into three genera:</p><p>&quot;1. Diatonic ...<br/>&quot;2. Chromatic ...<br/>&quot;3. Enharmonic ...</p><p>&quot;We can see a phenomenon of absorption of the ancient enharmonic by<br/>the diatonic. This must have taken place during the first centuries<br/>of Christianity, as part of the Church fathers&apos; struggle against<br/>paganism and certain of its manifestations in the arts.&quot;</p><p>&quot;C. The _tertiary order_ consists of the scales constructed with the<br/>help of systems having the same ancient rules of consonance,<br/>dissonance and assonance (paraphonia). In Byzantine music the<br/>principle of interation and juxtaposition of the system leads very<br/>clearly to scales, a development that is still fairly obscure in<br/>Aristoxenos and his successors, except for Ptolemy.&quot; Xenakis then<br/>describes numerous scales.</p><p>&quot;D. The _quaternary order_ consists of the tropes or echoi<br/>(ichi). ... Thus we have succintly expounded our analysis of the<br/>outside-time structure of Byzantine music.&quot;</p><p>Xenakis goes on to describe the temporal structure of Byzantine<br/>music, then goes into more philosophical territory, which is quite<br/>remarkably similar to comments of Harry Partch, although Partch is<br/>much easier to read. It was actually this last part which irrevocably<br/>linked Xenakis and Partch in my mind. Somehow focusing on ancient<br/>Greek music led these two composers to similar philosophies, but to<br/>vastly different musical styles.</p><p>I don&apos;t really think of Xenakis as a microtonal composer in the same<br/>sense as Partch, Ben Johnston and other familiar name. I&apos;ve got a<br/>fair amount of Xenakis and it is all over the map. Sometimes two<br/>seeds can fall great distances away from the same tree :-).<br/>--<br/>M.
