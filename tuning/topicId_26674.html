There is a late author, the reference to whom I cannot now<br/>find who, who called thirds and tritones &quot;paraphonic&quot; because they had<br/>some, but<br/>not all, the aural character of the true consonances. Nevertheless, I<br/>think it<br/>exaggeration to claim that the Greeks used ratios of 11, 13, 17, 19,<br/>etc. as<br/>consonances in the modern sense or had assimilated them to their musical system.</p><p>Basically, I think that the appearance of high primes in Eratosthenes&apos;s<br/>tunings is a fortunate artifact of his use of sexigesimal notation to<br/>express Aristoxenos&apos;s tetrachords as his enharmonic and chromatic<br/>tunings are identical to those of Aristoxenos expressed in this manner.<br/>Ptolemy, who was primarily an astronomer/astrology, also used this convention.</p><p>Eratosthenes, I believe, erroneously tried to express Cleonides&apos;s<br/>versions of<br/>Aristoxenos&apos;s genera as fractions of a string of 120 parts. The 120<br/>rather than<br/>100 or some other convenient length was chosen, IMO, because of the<br/>Greek tradition<br/>of doing serious mathematics in the decimal-coded  sexigesimal (base-60)<br/>notation<br/>deriving from Babylonian astronomy rather than in pure decimals. Happily<br/>the<br/>tetrachordal framework can be expressed this way in whole numbers as<br/>120 90 80 60, giving a lower fourth (120/90) divided by integers into 30<br/>parts<br/>in accordance with Cleonides&apos;s descriptions.  When one subtracts<br/>Cleonides&apos;s<br/>parts from 120, one gets string lengths whose successive ratios involve<br/>the higher primes automatically as seen below from Ptolemy&apos;s catalog.</p><p>Enharmonic: 3 + 3 + 24 parts to the Fourth,.<br/>120 117 114 90 or 40/39 x 39/ 38 x 19/15,<br/>50 + 50 + 400 cents vs 44 + 45 + 409,<br/>virtually the same as the quasi-Pythagorean tuning<br/>of Boethius: 512/499 x 499/486 x 81/64 or<br/>45 + 46+ 408.</p><p>Soft Chromatic: 4 + 4 + 22 parts<br/>120 116 112 90 or 30/29 x 29/28 x 56/45<br/>59 + 61 + 379 cents, closer to an enharmonic<br/>genus than the canonical 67 + 67 + 367 cents</p><p>Hemiolic Chromatic: 4.5 + 4.5 + 21 parts<br/>120 115.5 111 90  or   80/77 x 77/74 x 37/30<br/>66 + 69 + 363, a very good Soft Chromatic tuning!<br/>A closer fit would be the non-extant  5 + 5 + 20 parts<br/>120 115 110  90 or 24/23 x 23/22 x 11/9,<br/>74 + 77 + 347 cents for the canonical 75+ 75+ 350,  but this<br/>tuning appears only in Winnington-Ingram&apos;s discussion, AFAIK.<br/>Aristoxenos, IMO, wanted to stress that the pyknotic<br/>intervals are audibly intermediate between the enharmonic<br/>and intense Chromatic ones and hence described them as<br/>being 4.5 twelfths of tones wide rather than 5/12.</p><p>Tonal Chromatic 6 +6 + 18 parts, identical with Eratosthenes&apos;s tuning<br/>120 114 108  90 or 20/19 x 19/18 x  6/5<br/>89 + 94 + 316 for 100 + 100 + 300<br/>Compare to the Pythagorean 256/243 x 2187/2048 x 32/27.</p><p>Soft Diatonic : 6 + 9 + 15 parts<br/>120 114 105 90 or 20/19 x 38/35 x 7/6<br/>89 + 142 + 267 for the canonical 10 + 150 + 250 cents.</p><p>Intense Diatonic: 6 + 12 +12 parts<br/>120 114 102 90 or 20/19 x 19/17 x 17/15<br/>89+ 193 + 217 for the Pythagorean 90 + 204 + 204.<br/>Eratosthenes proposes the Pythagorean tuning instead of the<br/>pseudo-aristoxenian version above.</p><p>There is evidence independent of these scales for the widespread use of<br/>3/4 tone intervals and these may be approximated by the intervals 12/11<br/>and 11/10.  Although Robert Erickson derives the 3/4 tone pyknon<br/>of the hemiolic chromatic by 7 limit intervals, I think it was soon<br/>discovered<br/>that 12/11 is good approximation to this interval.   Hence it would be<br/>quite<br/>natural for Ptolemy to use it to notate a neutral diatonic tetrachord as<br/>120 110 100 90 when he heard it played.

His tuning for the Spondeion would thus be 12/11 x<br/>11/9 x 9/8<br/>x 12/11 x 11/9. After the 12/11&apos;s were divided the heptatonic form<br/>became identical<br/>to Aristoxenos&apos;s Hemiolic Chromatic.  He further suggests that 11/9 and 11/8<br/>may have occurred in the accompaniment, perhaps as paraphonies.</p><p>As for the other uses of high-limit ratios in Ptolemy&apos;s tunings, I think<br/>he was simply<br/>trying to express the Intense Chromatic and enharmonic with<br/>superparticular ratios.<br/>His tuning for the Intense Chromatic is 22/21 x 12/11 x 7/6, nearly the<br/>same as his (or Eratosthenes&apos;s) version of  Aristoxenos&apos;s Soft Diatonic.<br/> His enharmonic, 46/45 x 24/23<br/>x 5/4, represents a tripartite division of the pyknon and the<br/>recombination of two of the resulting intervals. The same process<br/>accounts for the 11 in the Intense Chromatic:<br/>8  /7 becomes 24/23 x 23/22 x 22/21. Recombining the 24/23  and 23/22 generates<br/>the 12/11 as the 2nd interval of the tetrachord.  The tripartite<br/>division may represent<br/>a stylistic peculiarity of Hellenistic or Alexandrian music which<br/>Ptolemy applied to the<br/>extinct enharmonic genus as well as the still played Intense Chromatic.</p><p>Didymos&apos;s 32/31 x 31/30 division of the 16/15 is simply the bipartite<br/>melodic division<br/>of the lowest interval in the chromatic and diatonic genera.  As this<br/>prime is<br/>used nowhere else in Didymos&apos;s tunings, I don&apos;t think that it represents<br/>the conscious appreciation of 31-ness, but rather an arithmetic<br/>convenience similar in spirit to<br/>Aristides Quintilianus&apos;s division of the whole tone as 18/17 x 17/16.</p><p>--John</p></div><h3><a id=26721 href="#26721">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2001 11:32:38 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., John Chalmers &lt;JHCHALMERS@U...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Joe and Allison:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I feel that Partch made too much of the occasional use of cetain<br/>ratios<br/>&gt; off 11 and 13 in Ptolemy&apos;s catalog of tunings and in Schlesinger&apos;s<br/>harmoniai.<br/>&gt; There is no convincing evidence that Schlesinger&apos;s aulos scales<br/>were ever<br/>&gt; part of Greek music</p><p>While I tend to agree, Kraig Grady has a dissenting viewpoint on this<br/>issue.
