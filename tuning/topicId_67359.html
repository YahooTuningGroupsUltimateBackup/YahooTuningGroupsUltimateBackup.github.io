I finally lived up to<br/>my promise, and in the future, maybe you&apos;ll see 2 other of his pieces played<br/>by yours truly.</p><p>My real acoustic piano is suffering from unstable tuning due to heat, humidity<br/>and new-ish strings, so I opted to record my P-200, which is fairly nice. I<br/>had to overtrack single channel audio files, and reassemble them in Audacity,<br/>alas, Yamaha P-200 no do multi-channel MIDI....</p><p>I hope you enjoy this little piece as much as I enjoyed preparing it! The<br/>tuning is Johnson/Secor rational WT.</p><p><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/LummaGuys.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/LummaGuys.ogg</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/Lummaguys.mp3">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/Lummaguys.mp3</a><br/>(0&apos;37&quot; in length)</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/2006 6:06:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Krister Johnson &lt;aaron@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/LummaGuys.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/LummaGuys.ogg</a><br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/Lummaguys.mp3">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/Lummaguys.mp3</a><br/>&gt; (0&apos;37&quot; in length)</p><p><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/LummaGuys.mp3">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/LummaGuys.mp3</a></p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/2006 8:24:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron Johnson wrote...<br/>&gt; Back in--2004, was it Carl?--when I first met Carl in the<br/>&gt; flesh in Berkeley, this piece was sitting on his piano, and<br/>&gt; I played it, and immediately found it to be attractive;</p><p>For those of you not on the MakeMicroMusic list, you can<br/>read more about this here:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/14402">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/14402</a></p><p>and</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/14403">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/14403</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div>
