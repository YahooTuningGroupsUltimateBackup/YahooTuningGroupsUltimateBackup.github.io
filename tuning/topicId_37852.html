It contains descriptions and history of<br/>the organs in the St. Laurens&apos; church, the Van Covelens organ which<br/>dates back to 1511 and the Van Hagerbeer/Schnitger organ (1646). The<br/>latter had subsemitonic keys in the past, D#/Eb and A#/Bb over the<br/>whole key range. Now it&apos;s in equal temperament, the Van Covelens<br/>organ is still in meantone. There are also descriptions of the other<br/>organs in Alkmaar, one of which is in Werckmeister III. There are 70<br/>minutes of sound examples and 350 photos on it. The virtual tour<br/>through the historical city is also nice. A minus point is that the<br/>text is in English only, and it only runs on Windows machines.<br/>To order go to <a href="http://www.schnitger.nl">http://www.schnitger.nl</a> . The price of 13 euro is<br/>very reasonable.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
