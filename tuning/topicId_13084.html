Anyway, the o/u distinction should<br/>be made by the series that seeds the special chords.  This will, it<br/>strikes me, actually be unfair against the utonal chords.  But when<br/>sensory dissonance is added back into the mix, utonal chords will be<br/>redeemed somewhat.  Remember h.e. is only half of our picture of<br/>concordance.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul H.
