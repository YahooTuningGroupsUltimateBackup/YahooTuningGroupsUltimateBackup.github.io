What are YAM values and does the QY70 uses them? How do I program the QY70 anyway? Enter code on a computer and send it to it? I am sorry but I am really a begginer on midi programming :)</p></div><h3>nils.blindenstein@...</h3><span>6/15/2016 2:27:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The answer is in your QY70&apos;s manual or additional material. There should be a section called &raquo;MIDI implementation&laquo;.</p><p>I have a QY300, and there&apos;s nothing you can do beyond the regular &rsaquo;master tuning&lsaquo;. I also had a look at the QY70 MIDI implementation -- same here.</p><p>So the answer is: no, you probably won&apos;t be able to do microtuning on your QY.</p><p>Which, on the one hand, is a pity, considering the great tuning features of other Yamaha products, even in a lot older ones (DX7 etc.). But on the other hand -- the QY is a mainly sequencer, not a sound generator. That&apos;s what you&apos;ll use the other devices for that, hopefully you&apos;ve got slaved to the QY :)</p><p>-- Nils</p></div>
