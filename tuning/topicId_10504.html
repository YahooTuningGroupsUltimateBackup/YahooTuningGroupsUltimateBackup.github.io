This is really helping a lot...</p><p>As someone who listens to Medieval music every day first thing in the<br/>morning (well, OK, sometimes I go up as far as RENNAISSANCE!, but not<br/>generally) I can expecially appreciate the Medieval mindset.</p><p>Oh, by the way, in case people don&apos;t know... there are lots of added<br/>&quot;bonuses&quot; on the Medieval site that Ms. Schulter was so kind to point me<br/>to... like the complete lyrics of Guillaume de Machaut...</p><p>http:/www.medieval.org</p><p>Just for the curious... Machaut is the &quot;hottest new&quot; item for the New<br/>York composer set... with very active and successful composers like<br/>Kitty Brazelton and Eve Beglarian fully immersed in interesting<br/>&quot;derivative&quot; works based upon these materials.</p><p>So I guess, in some sense, &quot;our ends are our beginnings...&quot;  Or, perhaps<br/>we&apos;re just &quot;running in place&quot; which is fine by me...</p><p>Thanks again to Ms. Schulter for all the help!</p><p>______________ _________ ____ __ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
