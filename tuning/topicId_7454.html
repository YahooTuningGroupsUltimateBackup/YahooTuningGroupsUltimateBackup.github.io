Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/1999 7:52:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and speaking from a medievalist viewpoint, I&apos;d like to<br/>suggest that for three-voice medieval sonorities featuring two fifths<br/>or fourths, the historical choice of Pythagorean tuning (3-limit just<br/>intonation) nicely optimizes the consonance of these sonorities.</p><p>Thus, using C4 for middle C and higher numbers for higher octaves:</p><p>    | A4              | F4<br/>    |    3:2          |    4:3<br/>9:4 | D4         16:9 | C4<br/>    |    3:2          |    4:3<br/>    | G3              | G3</p><p> (M9|5-5)          (m7|4-4)</p><p>Below each example, I&apos;ve indicated a kind of &quot;neo-medieval&quot; notation<br/>for such three-voice combinations, showing first the outer interval,<br/>then the lower and upper adjacent intervals. Thus an outer ninth<br/>divided into two fifths by the middle voice -- 4:6:9 -- is shown as<br/>(M9|5-5); a minor seventh divided into two fourths -- 9:12:16 -- is<br/>shown as (m7|4-4).</p><p>Pythagorean tuning -- 3-limit JI, or &quot;chain tuning in pure fifths&quot; if<br/>you like -- fits nicely with the statements of two theorists around<br/>1300 that the major ninth &quot;concords well&quot; if a middle voice is added<br/>to produce two fifths.</p><p>For example, there&apos;s a late 14th-century piece from an English<br/>manuscript which has lots of very pleasing combinations of this kind<br/>with major ninths and fifths; the combination of a minor seventh and<br/>two fourths is likewise approved by Jacobus of Liege (c. 1325), and<br/>has a prominent role in some music around 1200.</p><p>In a medieval setting, these kinds of sonorities are _relatively_<br/>blending but definitely unstable; in the 20th century, of course, they<br/>may be treated as full concords.</p><p>This is isn&apos;t to say, I&apos;ll add just for the sake of caution, that<br/>3-limit JI is the _only_ way to tune these combinations; some people<br/>may like meantone, and 12-tone equal temperament (12-tet) gives a<br/>reasonably close approximation to 3-limit.</p><p>Incidentally, while a sonority with _three_ fourths (e.g. D3-G3-C4-F4)<br/>goes a bit beyond usual medieval practice, Jacobus does mention it as<br/>one possible combination with an outer minor tenth.</p><p>Here a Pythagorean tuning would give pure 4:3 fourths and 16:9 minor<br/>sevenths, plus an outer minor tenth at 64:27 -- not too far from 19:8,<br/>for those who regard 19:16 as an ideal minor third.</p><p>In Japanese _gagaku_, the traditional orchestral music, some very<br/>complex sonorities are reportedly built from superimposed fifths and<br/>fourths, and I wonder if a pure 3-limit tuning is used.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
