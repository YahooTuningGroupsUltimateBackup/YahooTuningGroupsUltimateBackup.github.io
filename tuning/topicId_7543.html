There is no mention of Handel having more than<br/>12<br/>&gt;&gt; keys in Joel Mandelbaum&apos;s dissertation.  After checking from my copy, I<br/>spoke<br/>&gt;&gt; with Joel on the telephone.  He was aware of the topic but couldn&apos;t find<br/>any<br/>&gt;&gt; reference to Handel either...I think he&apos;s still checking as I write this.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The primary source is Bosanquet (an authority well-respected by Alexander<br/>J.<br/>&gt;&gt; Ellis as evidenced by his regular mention in the Helmholtz book.  It is<br/>14<br/>&gt;&gt; and I bring it out, along with other &quot;assumptions&quot; that have been made on<br/>&gt;&gt; this list that I think should be re-examined.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;     &quot;There can be no doubt that, with the musicians of Handel&apos;s time, the<br/>&gt;&gt; good keys of the old unequal temperament, i.e. the mean-tone system,<br/>formed<br/>&gt;&gt; the ideal of the &apos;best&apos; tuning attainable.  The proof of this is to be<br/>found<br/>&gt;&gt; in the fact that Handel took the trouble to employ an arrangement, by<br/>which<br/>&gt;&gt; the range of good keys available on the ordinary board with this system<br/>could<br/>&gt;&gt; be somewhat extended.  It is well known that he presented to the<br/>Foundling<br/>&gt;&gt; Chapel an organ possessing additional keys for this purpose.  The organ<br/>at<br/>&gt;&gt; the Temple Church in its original state, as built by Father Smith,<br/>possessed<br/>&gt;&gt; a similar arrangement.&quot;  Bosanquet goes on to describe the 1688 Temple<br/>Church<br/>&gt;&gt; organ which had 14 notes in the compass of an octave:  Ab-G# and D#-Eb<br/>were<br/>&gt;&gt; the alternates chromatics.</p><p>&gt;From Sybil Marcus, _A Survey of Musical Instruments_: &quot;The Second<br/>requirement<br/>&gt;[(In transposition) Prior to ET, to furnish accidentals not otherwise<br/>&gt;available..although this defect was sometimes remedied by split keys] was<br/>met in<br/>&gt;certain organs (such as that of the Foundling Hospital, London) a special<br/>&gt;transposition register whereby those accidental keys normally tuned C# D#<br/>G# A#<br/>&gt;could be changed to provide Db Eb Ab Bb.&quot;</p><p>Thanks Clark. I knew I wasn&apos;t dreaming. The Mandelbaum sticks in my memory<br/>too -- hopefully I&apos;ll be able to check that within a day or two.</p></div>
