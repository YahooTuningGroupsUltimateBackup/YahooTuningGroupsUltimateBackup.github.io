In order to do<br/>this, I sought to come up with the &quot;flattest&quot; harmonic waveform<br/>possible, as per Carl&apos;s suggestion.</p><p>It is useful to recognize that when we talk about waveforms that have<br/>the same frequency response but generally &quot;look&quot; different in the time<br/>domain, the only thing that differs is the phase response. For<br/>example, the following three waveforms all have the same magnitude<br/>response, which is 1 for all frequencies:</p><p>1) A perfect impulse (a Dirac delta distribution)<br/>2) A sine sweep<br/>3) White noise</p><p>However, the phase responses will differ for all three of these. If<br/>you look at a graph of frequency vs phase response, the impulse&apos;s<br/>phase will be a line, the sine sweep&apos;s will be a parabola, and the<br/>white noise&apos;s will be random. And in each case, the Fourier transform<br/>for each of these signals will yield a series of sine waves, infinite<br/>in each direction, that &quot;magically&quot; interfere and reinforce and cancel<br/>each other out and yield the original signal. They also sound really<br/>different: the impulse sounds like a &quot;click,&quot; a sine sweep is a sine<br/>sweep, and white noise is white noise.</p><p>The convolution of any of the above three waveforms with an impulse<br/>train will yield a &quot;periodic&quot; version of that waveform. So a periodic<br/>impulse train, or a periodic sine sweep, or periodic noise. In the<br/>frequency domain, the convolution will cancel out all frequencies<br/>except those which are at integer multiples of the fundamental. So<br/>it&apos;s a good idea to come up with periodic versions of the above three<br/>waveforms to evaluate their impact on the periodicity buzz produced.</p><p>I&apos;m actually using a variant of this approach, slightly easier to<br/>compute, which is to take a symmetrical chirp that goes from 0 Hz up<br/>to 22050 Hz and back down, and convolve that with an impulse train. So<br/>the base waveform looks like this:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/symmetricchirptrain.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/symmetricchirptrain.png</a></p><p>Here&apos;s the frequency response of this waveform:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/symmetricchirptrainfft.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/symmetricchirptrainfft.png</a></p><p>The harmonics seem to have random amplitude, but the wave is obviously<br/>still periodic enough and will do as a suitable test waveform for<br/>periodicity buzz. Let&apos;s use this signal for our base and see what<br/>happens as we tweak the phase response.</p><p>There are four more variants of this wave: one in which the phase is<br/>linear across the board (mimicking an impulse), and three in which the<br/>phase is random (mimicking periodic noise). Here is a graph displaying<br/>the time domain waveform, the magnitude response, and the phase<br/>response for all three:</p><p><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/buzzcomparison.png">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/buzzcomparison.png</a></p><p>Although the chirp phase response looks linear, it is actually ordered<br/>in some kind of pattern that is not easily discernible to me. Either<br/>way, it generates a smooth periodic chirp in the time domain rather<br/>than periodic noise.</p><p>Here are the examples:</p><p>At 441 Hz:<br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441periodicchirp.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441periodicchirp.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441pseudoimpulse.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441pseudoimpulse.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441periodicnoise.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441periodicnoise.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441periodicnoise2.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441periodicnoise2.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441periodicnoise3.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/441periodicnoise3.wav</a></p><p>At 220.5 Hz:<br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5periodicchirp.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5periodicchirp.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5pseudoimpulse.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5pseudoimpulse.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5periodicnoise.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5periodicnoise.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5periodicnoise2.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5periodicnoise2.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5periodicnoise3.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/220.5periodicnoise3.wav</a></p><p>At 110.25 Hz:<br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25periodicchirp.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25periodicchirp.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25pseudoimpulse.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25pseudoimpulse.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25periodicnoise.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25periodicnoise.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25periodicnoise2.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25periodicnoise2.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25periodicnoise3.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/110.25periodicnoise3.wav</a></p><p>At 55.125 Hz:<br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125periodicchirp.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125periodicchirp.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125pseudoimpulse.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125pseudoimpulse.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125periodicnoise.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125periodicnoise.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125periodicnoise2.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125periodicnoise2.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125periodicnoise3.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/55.125periodicnoise3.wav</a></p><p>At 27.5625 Hz:<br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625periodicchirp.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625periodicchirp.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625pseudoimpulse.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625pseudoimpulse.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625periodicnoise.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625periodicnoise.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625periodicnoise2.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625periodicnoise2.wav</a><br/><a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625periodicnoise3.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/27.5625periodicnoise3.wav</a></p><p>Note that as the frequency response gets lower, the phenomenon gets<br/>more apparent, peaking at around 55.125 Hz. The difference is always<br/>the most striking between the &quot;impulse&quot; and the &quot;chirp&quot; equivalents at<br/>each frequency. In the case of 55.125 Hz, I can also actually hear<br/>some kind of imprint of the &quot;noise&quot; in the upper partials, as if they<br/>aren&apos;t all onsetting at the same time, but randomly.</p><p>I have never heard of anything like this in the psychoacoustics<br/>literature, so I&apos;m not sure how to explain this. This certainly<br/>destroys any notion I had that the cochlear critical band is involved.<br/>So how do we explain this?</p><p>Carl has put forward the hypothesis that the entire phenomenon is due<br/>to mainly to time domain processing, which I think can be more<br/>rigorously stated by saying that the brain fails to fully resolve the<br/>signal into a &quot;pitched&quot; component. That is, auditory scene processing<br/>partitions or &quot;leaks&quot; some of the signal into a noise component, where<br/>a nonpitched time-domain analysis is made and which yields the<br/>perception of a periodic nonpitched signal is perceived. This<br/>certainly could be what&apos;s happening.</p><p>Another hypothesis, which may not be mutually exclusive to the above<br/>one,  which is supported by the fact that you can kind of hear some<br/>weird &quot;noise imprint&quot; in some of the &quot;periodic noise&quot; examples, is<br/>that the brain&apos;s time-frequency representation is not uniform across<br/>the board. This means that if we&apos;re dealing with a waveform at 50 Hz,<br/>and one which has harmonics at 100 Hz, 150 Hz, etc, then the harmonics<br/>can turn on and off &quot;in the middle&quot; of the waveform&apos;s period. There is<br/>a lot of reference to this sort of thing in the literature.</p><p>So rather than the brain separating an impulse train into a bunch of<br/>harmonic sine waves that stretch across the waveform&apos;s period, the<br/>brain would then separate the impulse train into a bunch of harmonic<br/>sine &quot;wavelets&quot; that are time-limited and DO NOT stretch across the<br/>full period of the waveform. For the impulse train, the wavelets would<br/>all be located at the onset of each impulse. For the periodic chirp,<br/>the wavelets would be placed across the waveform in a way that<br/>corresponds with the instantaneous frequency of the chirp. For the<br/>noise, the wavelets would be randomly placed all across the waveform.<br/>It may be that the temporal placement of these wavelets plays a role<br/>in VF detection, and the ones that are too far off for the brain to<br/>make any sense of it are sent to the noise channel.</p><p>This is my current understanding, and thus ends my sitrep.

I guess you could say my main concern, so far as<br/>I understand your experiment at the point, is that phase cancellation at<br/>changing frequencies is not adding an extra factor that causes the mind to<br/>categorize more things as noise.</p></div><h3><a id=95527 href="#95527">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2011 10:14:17 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:<br/>&gt; This certainly destroys any notion I had that the cochlear critical band is involved.</p><p>Actually, after thinking more about it, it might still be that<br/>cochlear critical band effects are somehow involved.

Because the brain isn&apos;t performing a frequency<br/>analysis on the data, it&apos;s performing a time-frequency analysis on the<br/>data. If you take the Fourier transform of an impulse vs a sine sweep,<br/>the analysis stretches outward to infinity. Over infinity, the exact<br/>series of sine waves that magically add to reconstruct the original<br/>signal end up a series of sine waves at every frequency and with<br/>phases like those described.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;What do you mean by linear phase partials?&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meaning that the phase will be linear IE it would not rotate at a rate that would change the perception of a frequency at all.

And first off, if the sinusoid is sped up to<br/>sound like 301 Hz, that would still be a linear phase modulation - the<br/>modulating waveform would look like a diagonal line (or a sawtooth<br/>wave, if you allow there to be jumps from +pi to -pi). If you&apos;re<br/>modulating the phase of the signal in a way that isn&apos;t linear, you&apos;re<br/>going to be doing all kinds of stuff to the frequency domain of that<br/>signal - we&apos;re moving into the realm of FM and there will be sidebands<br/>and such.</p><p>But if a filter is &quot;linear phase,&quot; that means that the frequency vs<br/>phase response (w vs angle(F(w))) is a line. We generally look at<br/>frequency vs magnitude response (w vs abs(F(w)))plots, so this is a<br/>bit different.</p><p>But every one of the sinusoids in your example would have had to have<br/>the phase chugging along at a constant rate, or else they wouldn&apos;t be<br/>sinusoids.</p><p>&gt; Actually I&apos;ve seen many phase vocoders that store frequency in a separate array, and don&apos;t simply calculate it from fftbinindex * (22050/fftsize), to take into account that phase shifts affect frequency perception and get extra accuracy in frequency placement over what the FFT bin size allows.&nbsp; If the phase was linear no such method would be needed....</p><p>Wow, I didn&apos;t realize you were so deep into DSP. Yeah, I learned about<br/>that approach at school, although the explanation I was given is a bit<br/>different. This arises because the actual &quot;best match&quot; to each<br/>frequency sometimes lies between successive DFT bins (which it always<br/>will unless your window size happens to be an exact multiple of the<br/>period of the frequency you want). So the actual best frequency fits<br/>between them, and between successive windows it will look like there&apos;s<br/>crazy phase shifting between the &quot;rounded off&quot; bins. However, after<br/>two windows, you can see how the phase has changed and calculate the<br/>actual best frequency.</p><p>Very impressive Mike, I didn&apos;t realize you were so far into this<br/>stuff! Have you messed with the wavelet transform at all? I want to<br/>load the waveforms in this example up into a CWT and see if the<br/>partials beat periodically. Perhaps we could use a wavelet that has<br/>all harmonics present, and the whole shebang could be used to model<br/>the &quot;second filterbank&quot; in the brain that I was talking about before.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=95532 href="#95532">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2011 12:41:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>MikeB&gt; &gt;&quot;What do you mean by linear phase partials?&quot;<br/>Me&gt; &quot;Meaning that the phase will be linear IE it would not rotate at  a rate<br/>that would change the perception of a frequency at all.

For a while I was obsessed with the idea of taking<br/>sound files and reducing them to only partials that were &quot;in-tune&quot;...a bit like<br/>auto-tune only, of course, I used microtonal scales and added extra<br/>partials/area to help account for reproducing the effect of noise.   Oh<br/>yeah...and then aligning the resulting partials to more-or-less the curve of<br/>human hearing (using about 16 &quot;blocks&quot; for all the frequencies...each who&apos;s<br/>average amplitude matches the curve of human hearing) so I could play the result<br/>very loudly without hurting my ears as much as an unprocessed sound file.   And<br/>then I found a phase vocoder library that seemed to finally be able to<br/>manipulate sound enough to handle that sort of thing and started figuring out<br/>how the code worked...learning a good deal about DSP terms and applications<br/>along the way.</p><p>      I abandoned the project when I had two issues<br/>A) Trouble figuring out an algorithm to determine which pre-defined schema<br/>frequency (IE one in a scale) to match each partial in a wave file<br/>to...especially when the partial is right-smack in between two notes of a scale<br/>(which tone in the scale should I add the amplitude of the partial value to).<br/>Plus there was the problem of, if there are multiple partials between two<br/>scale/schema points...how much should I weight each of them to determining the<br/>scale-point amplitude (not to mention phase)?<br/>B)  The other issue was the compression algorithm.  My &quot;hack&quot; on doing<br/>compression involved taking a 2048...taking 100 or so &quot;scale frequencies&quot; spread<br/>through all 2048 bins that match my scale schema, pitch shifting the results<br/>into the first/lowest 100 or so bins, and saving the result as a much lower HZ<br/>wave file IE  100/2048*22050hz = about 1076hz..about a 20 to 1 rate of<br/>compression.   Since the &quot;compressed&quot; output is a wave file, of course, you can<br/>then shove the output into a FLAC encoder and get another factor of 2 or so of<br/>compression.<br/>    However, as it turns out, even using a Short-Time-frame-FFT, there were<br/>major accuracy issues on encode and decode (the fact each of these steps<br/>requires using two slightly phase-warping sFFTs, of course, did not help).<br/>Apparently just because I put accurate values into the first 100 bins does not<br/>mean I get anything near accurate values on the way out: everything sounded<br/>horribly distorted and the phasing way off.</p><p> If you have any hacks for such or ways to describe why the pitch shifting<br/>downward (encode) and/or reverse pitch-shifting (decode) would garble the<br/>signal, or any creative hacks for the other problems I encountered which went<br/>above my head, though...I&apos;m all ears.</p><p>MikeB&gt;&quot;the actual best frequency fits between them, and between successive<br/>windows it will look like there&apos;s crazy phase shifting between the &quot;rounded off&quot;<br/>bins.&quot;<br/>    Exactly...and the mind reads the phase shift over the windowed fading<br/>between the FFT windows as a frequency shift.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Have you messed with the wavelet transform at all? &quot;<br/>    No but maybe I should.

A chirp, for example, has parabolic phase. I think we&apos;d all<br/>agree that a chirp, white noise, and an impulse sound different, and I<br/>never said otherwise.</p><p>What we really hear as being different is when group delay varies from<br/>frequency to frequency. Group delay is the derivative of phase<br/>response, so if phase response is linear, group delay will be<br/>constant. More about that here:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_delay_and_phase_delay">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_delay_and_phase_delay</a></p><p>So here&apos;s an example: let&apos;s say that you have a chord<br/>1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:10:11:12:..., made with cosines, and the phase of<br/>each is 0. So the phase vs frequency plot will be 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,<br/>0, 0, - a line. Then let&apos;s say you make the same chord, but this time<br/>the phase of each is 90 degrees: 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90,<br/>90, etc. Still a line, shouldn&apos;t sound any different. Now let&apos;s say<br/>you make the same chord, but this time the phases are distributed like<br/>this: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 - still a line,<br/>shouldn&apos;t sound any different (or rather, it&apos;ll correspond to a<br/>delayed version of the original signal - this is what a non-constant,<br/>linear phase shift produces).</p><p>Now let&apos;s say you make the same chord, but this time the phases are<br/>distributed like this: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc - parabolic. This should<br/>sound different, and it does.

Now I&apos;ll do stuff to the phase response<br/>&gt;&gt; of this signal. You will hear, very clearly, what is audible and what<br/>&gt;&gt; is not.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Linear phase:<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/realperson90.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/realperson90.wav</a> - all sines<br/>&gt;&gt; put 90 degrees out of phase, sounds identical to the original<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/realpersonlphase.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/realpersonlphase.wav</a> - all<br/>&gt;&gt; sines shifted in phase linearly with respect to frequency. This<br/>&gt;&gt; creates a uniform group delay for each frequency, so the entire signal<br/>&gt;&gt; is delayed in time. The way I did it makes the portion of the signal<br/>&gt;&gt; that is delayed past the end of the array &quot;wrap around&quot; to the<br/>&gt;&gt; beginning, so you first hear the end and not the beginning. Still no<br/>&gt;&gt; audible difference in sound quality.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Nonlinear phase:<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/realpersonparabolic.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/realpersonparabolic.wav</a> - The<br/>&gt;&gt; phase of each sine is shifted quadratically with respect to frequency.<br/>&gt;&gt; This means that each impulse becomes a sine sweep. I sound like I&apos;m in<br/>&gt;&gt; space with laser guns shooting all around me.<br/>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/realpersondnoise.wav">http://www.mikebattagliamusic.com/music/realpersondnoise.wav</a> - The<br/>&gt;&gt; phase of each sine is shifted randomly.

I accomplished this by<br/>&gt;&gt; convolving the signal with nondecaying white noise. Every frequency<br/>&gt;&gt; that was anywhere in the signal is now simultaneously everywhere at<br/>&gt;&gt; the same time. This is like an infinite sustaining reverb effect.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; So there you go, now you can hear what matters and what doesn&apos;t.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=95592 href="#95592">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/14/2011 6:19:41 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris&gt;&quot;yes, this was to Mike B - not michael I quoted his entire message....&quot;</p><p>   Indeed when I replied...I did a quick scan and saw no quote at the top.<br/>Having seen no quote above your statements, I assumed you were making a general<br/>comment and thus I did not scroll down to look for said full message (which, of<br/>course, now it&apos;s obvious was there).</p><p>    I&apos;m used to the Tuning list where people rarely quote whole messages (heck,<br/>I&apos;ve even been bugged numerous times &quot;please don&apos;t quote whole messages&quot; on that<br/>list)...and look for quotes at the top not the bottom...lesson learned: from now<br/>on I&apos;ll look for both.</p></div>
