I haven&apos;t studied it, so<br/>can&apos;t give more historical info than that.</p><p>Certainly, scat singers make use of any tuning they wish, not<br/>so much because it&apos;s jazz, but primarily because it&apos;s *vocal*.</p><p>The voice has the flexibility to sustain any pitch it&apos;s capable<br/>of producing, and since scat singing is generally meant to be<br/>an imitation of jazz instrumental playing, it makes liberal<br/>use of all the bending, smearing, twisting, etc., of pitch<br/>that jazz instrumentalists use, and perhaps uses these techniques<br/>even *more* intensively, *because* of the freedom of the voice.</p><p>Sorry I don&apos;t know enough specifics about Indian music to offer<br/>comparisons.  Hope what I gave you helps.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2001 7:19:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>............<br/>&gt; The voice has the flexibility to sustain any pitch it&apos;s capable<br/>&gt; of producing, and since scat singing is generally meant to be<br/>&gt; an imitation of jazz instrumental playing, it makes liberal<br/>&gt; use of all the bending, smearing, twisting, etc., of pitch<br/>&gt; that jazz instrumentalists use, and perhaps uses these techniques<br/>&gt; even *more* intensively, *because* of the freedom of the voice.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Monz, thanks for your post.  &quot;nomtom&quot; is the beginning part of<br/>Drupad singing.  It is performed without rhythm.  It sounds like<br/>imitation of string sounds of vina or sitar.  The syllables used do<br/>not have any meaning. When improvising in a khayal, only aaaaa is<br/>used; in nomtom, a, aaaaa, eeeee, ooo, o, mm, Om (with a suitable<br/>consonant like soft t, na etc.) are used.  This lends beautiful<br/>additional texture to improvisation.  And there is an extensive<br/>application of several embellishments like gamaka, meend etc. With<br/>Dhrupad out of vogue, even nomtom has disappeared, unfortunately.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Haresh.</p></div>
