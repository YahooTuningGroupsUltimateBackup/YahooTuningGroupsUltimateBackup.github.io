But as everyone considers &gt; my work derivative and unoriginal - never mind.</p><p>There are problems with alternative EDOs?  I wonder what they could be.   I&apos;m back to the belief that we have all the theory we need to about EDOs, but I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll change my mind when somebody does come up with something new.  I remember your paper back when we were doing a lot of work on tuning-math.  As you didn&apos;t join in the discussions, of course you didn&apos;t contribute anything.  Gene&apos;s looking at alternating generators, as you&apos;ve seen, so maybe he&apos;s coming round to your way of thinking.  I can&apos;t see the point of it myself :-S</p><p>&gt; Sadly, from personal experience of the UK microtonal scene, I shall not &gt; be attending the UK Microfest 1. Unfortunately, the Microfest does not &gt; promote an inclusive and integrative approach to microtonality. Instead &gt; it somewhat resembles a Society for Mutual Admiration.</p><p>And there&apos;s a UK microtonal scene?  Well, that&apos;s more news to me!  I didn&apos;t think anything was happening until this festival was announced. I mean, it&apos;s not like the list&apos;s been weighted down with concert notices and links to British music, is it?  But little did I know that not only is there enough of a scene to get together a one and a half day festival, but there&apos;s also a whole load of other microtonal music that they left out!  Well, surely a cause for celebration!!  Where is it?</p><p>&gt; Personally, everyone in the UK should boycott an event so biased to one &gt; UK composer and their own biased view of microtonality (i.e. 1/4 &gt; tones). Such a monopoly of microtonality should be avoided. I also &gt; think that it is a crying shame that they could not be bothered to &gt; include others in their event.</p><p>Wow, that&apos;s two &quot;biased&quot;s in one sentence.  It&apos;s run by Donald Bousted, who uses 19-equal, so I&apos;m sure the 1/4 tone bias can&apos;t be from that direction.</p><p>Basically, you&apos;re saying that because you feel it&apos;s biased towards one group, nobody else should attend?  That sounds like a guaranteed way to make sure the mutual admiration society remains a society for mutual admiration.  It makes about as much sense as all the people who leave this list after years of silence because the things they&apos;re interested in don&apos;t get discussed.</p><p>Wouldn&apos;t it make more sense for the neglected masses of British microtonalists to organize a fringe event to showcase the riches that are being ignored?  Maybe you could hold it on the Sunday, to catch the people who are staying overnight.</p><p>&gt; As I said, the pluralist view is not on their agenda.</p><p>They reject 12-note meantone, yes.  And 12-equal for that matter.  I know that 12-equal is considered microtonal in some parts.  They cover pretty much everything else.</p><p>&gt; Of course I am on the outside of the little club, and perhaps this is &gt; all pique. That said, take a look at their program and form your own &gt; opinion.</p><p>I looked at the programme[1] and I can&apos;t see your problem.  Not knowing how much time should be assigned to each different tuning system, I can&apos;t say if there&apos;s a bias towards quartertones.  Not knowing who belongs to their clique (seeing as I didn&apos;t even know there were enough of us to form a clique) I can&apos;t say if they&apos;re looking outside of it or not.  Finally, not knowing who they didn&apos;t ask, I can&apos;t say how grevious the omission was.</p><p>I am somewhat surprised that all the thanks they get for organising the thing is griping about what wasn&apos;t included.  But then obviously, not only not being part of the clique but not even being part of the clique that&apos;s excluded from the clique, I don&apos;t know anything about the politics that might be behind it.</p><p>Still, I wish you luck with all the work you must be about to do.</p><p>                   Graham</p><p>[1] Yes, that&apos;s how we spell it in the UK.</p></div><h3><a id=60664 href="#60664">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2005 4:20:08 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;Gene&apos;s looking at alternating<br/>&gt; generators, as you&apos;ve seen, so maybe he&apos;s coming round to your way<br/>of<br/>&gt; thinking.  I can&apos;t see the point of it myself :-S</p><p>One use for it is as a way of indentifying interesting structures in<br/>a MOS. When you consider Pajara/Diaschismic[10], and want to study it<br/>deeply, one of the things you ought to know is that it has a cycle of<br/>major and minor thirds. It has worked for me to indentify some<br/>interesting scales I hadn&apos;t given much attention to; consider for<br/>instance Rodan[31].</p><p>Rodan is the temperament with generators of 8/7 such that three<br/>genertors give the fifth and 17 generators the 5. Because of the<br/>complexity of 5, and the low complexity and error of 3 and 7, it<br/>starts out as a good no-fives system, with some nice MOS if you dig<br/>that scene. However, when we get to 31 we see that a 5/4 takes 17<br/>generators, and a 6/5 takes 3-17=-14 generators. Most of the time a<br/>scale step will be the root of either a utonal or an otonal tetrad,<br/>but not both; in this respect it is quite like the diatonic scale. We<br/>have three wolf fifths which actually invoke the 13-limit resources<br/>of rodan, being pretty good 13/9s, and so we get screwy 9:11:13<br/>chords at three places without fifths. All of this, tuned for example<br/>in 128edo, gives some decent harmonic resources, but it&apos;s less<br/>obvious than Meantone[7] or Schismatic[17].</p></div>
