They are very knowledgeable. You can join it at:</p><p><a href="http://www.musicdsp.org/">http://www.musicdsp.org/</a></p><p>Now to address your question:</p><p>I would be concerned with transient smearing and/or loss, or metallic sound, which are common artifacts in basic pitch shifting. What you want to do is more advanced than pitch shifting since, if I understand your idea correctly, you may want to shift some signal components up and some down. While I don&apos;t want to discourage you, I think you should aware that this can be an easy problem or an extremely hard problem, depending on if you expect the output to sound better than the input and depending on if you want it to work for polyphonic signals or not.</p><p>- Magnus Jonsson</p><p>On Sat, 8 Oct 2005, tonydananza wrote:</p><p>&gt; I first discovered alternate tuning a few weeks ago and I was very<br/>&gt; excited about the idea.

This is the first proposal I&apos;ve heard for retuning music<br/>after it&apos;s been made.  Neat idea.
