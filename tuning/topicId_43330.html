On his invitation I&apos;m going to present on my<br/>research there end of June.</p><p>JR: Pretty rude, here.  I do not have his e-mail.  Nor do I have the ease in<br/>speaking German that he requires.  We met a number of years ago, after an<br/>afternoon practice.  I didn&apos;t hear the smaller organ at the time so didn&apos;t<br/>hear the WIII tuned music until I returned home.  Returning again, I got the<br/>new album, with all the German talking on it.  This music is playing much<br/>more lightly, and more convincingly.  I was sold.<br/>You seem deaf to the difference.  It&apos;s not my place to diagnose the reason<br/>why.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: And even if the Werckmeister temperament would<br/>&gt;&gt; unexpectedly have been heard from the organ in St.<br/>&gt;&gt; Jakobi in around 1700 in the organ(s) in St. Jakobi,<br/>&gt;&gt; it would not mean, that the organ(s) in the<br/>&gt;&gt; neighbouring church St. Marien, where Buxtehude worked,<br/>&gt;&gt; must have had a well-temperament.</p><p>JR: It is Buxtehude&apos;s music that determines that the organ had a<br/>well-temperament.  If the organ must play notes outside of the meantone<br/>compass, then the organ must be in well-temperament.  Get your knows into the<br/>music scores.<br/>&Oslash; JR: Once again, it appears there is some disconnect<br/>&gt; here.</p><p>Ibo: You might have noticed, meanwhile, that I always try to avoid to<br/>connect items, which don&apos;t show any sign of a connection. That&apos;s<br/>good scientific habit, which keeps one rather much free from<br/>disturbing own preferences ...</p><p>JR: Yes, and a musician connects things together.  And this is not science.<br/>It is music.<br/>&Oslash; But besides the listening, which is understandably<br/>&gt; suspect to you,</p><p>can&apos;t you read?</p><p>What do you think, how I tuned the instruments for the Tomkins<br/>recording? I do not use electronic aids, just a simple tuning fork.<br/>When you have trained your ear so that you can do similar<br/>requirements, then let us talk again.</p><p>JR: Hi, I&apos;m back.  However, instead of listing anything here, I suggest you<br/>look my name up on Google.  We have more in common that you thought.  I don&apos;t<br/>even use a tuning fork!  I get an A=440 from a discovered multiphonic (as<br/>long as the instrument is warmed up).  Everything is relative from there.</p><p>&gt; Buxtehude wrote a poem dedicated to Werckmesiter. It<br/>&gt; came in 1702, later than the 1691 Musicalische Temperatur.<br/>&gt; He must have been a friend to write a stanza poem<br/>&gt; in Werckmeister&apos;s honor. He must have been satisfied with<br/>&gt; what Werckmeister&apos;s tuning had to offer. And he must<br/>&gt; have had the time to fully decide if it was of<br/>&gt; substantial importance to the creation of his own<br/>&gt; music.</p><p>Ibo: He must this, he must that - nothing better to offer?</p><p>JR:  Yes.  Werckmeister gave original Buxtehude manuscripts to Werckmeister,<br/>who then gave them to J. G. Walther.  This is described in a letter of 1729<br/>by Walther.  Doesn&apos;t that show some friendship between Buxtehude and<br/>Werckmeister?  All those manuscripts?</p><p>Walther: &quot;The ones of the former I received mainly from the late Mr.<br/>Werckmeister, in Mr. Buxtehude&apos;s own hand and in German tablature&mldr;</p><p>Ibo: However, I pointed to the possible irony in Schnitger&apos;s poem<br/>already, which he wrote for the same volume of Werckmeister&apos;s. And<br/>it was Schnitger, whom Buxtehude wanted to carry out the<br/>renovation of the large organ in St. Marien.<br/>This Schnitger, who did not subscribe to W.&apos;s new temperamentS, - This<br/>Schnitger, for whom in each single case only meantone temperament can be<br/>proven, was the choice for Buxtehude. Finally, the work was carried out by<br/>Otto Diedrich Richborn from Hamburg, Schnitgers concurrence in Hamburg, where<br/>both had their workshop.  Nothing points to, that Buxtehdue wanted an<br/>instrument, that would have noticebly to everyone, different than the<br/>&quot;meantone ocean&quot; around him.</p><p>JR: The ocean has many critters in it.  There were other than quarter comma<br/>meantone, no?</p><p>How about this which I found on the Internet:<br/>+Subject: Temperament From: &quot;Bob Elms&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:elmsr@albanyis.com.au">elmsr@albanyis.com.au</a>&gt; Date: Sun, 04<br/>Nov 2001 06:06:33 -0800 I realize that the subject of temperament has been<br/>well aired, but some recent bulletins have touched on the question of when<br/>equal temperament became the norm. &gt;From correspondence in Organists Review<br/>came the following: &quot;.. the question of the temperament used by Jurgen Ahrend<br/>in his restoration of the Schnitger St Jacobi organ.. it was there (in a past<br/>OR) that one read that, in certain temperaments,&apos;one had to endure<br/>considerable harshness &apos; in some major keys.&quot; It went further that &quot;on the<br/>advice of Andreas Werckmeister in 1688 that instrument had been tuned to<br/>equal temperament, and that his friend JS Bach himself had championed this<br/>system, in the face of reluctant organ builders&quot;.</p><p>Then there is the Ahrend Werckmeister-tuned organ in Berkely, California:</p><p>&quot;St. Joseph of Arimathea Anglican Theological College, in Berkeley,<br/>California, is the seminary of the Anglican Province of Christ the King, a<br/>nationwide body of Christian Churches dedicated to maintaining traditional<br/>Episcopalian faith and practice in the United States. Founded in 1979 to<br/>serve the Anglican Province of Christ the King, Saint Joseph&apos;s serves the<br/>need of the Province to educate men for the priesthood and otherwise prepare<br/>them&mldr;&quot; etc.</p><p>BTW, I had heard that the St. Jacobi Kirche in Hamburg was tuned by Ahrend<br/>into Werckmeister III by a prominent German composer.  So, if we are<br/>mistaken, it would be good to know.</p><p>The connections of Werckmeister tuning to St. Jacobi would seem to be made by<br/>Johann Mathesson in his Grosse General-Bass-Schule, p. 23, in a chapter<br/>(XLVI) devoted to Werckmeister&apos;s tuning.  Maybe you could help us with a<br/>translation?</p><p>&quot;&mldr;und etwas von der Jacobi-Orgel/auch von der Menschen-Stimme/ dass sehr<br/>trosstlich ist.&quot;</p><p>Further on, Matheson mentions that Werckmeister&apos;s &quot;Temperatur&quot; was used for<br/>the Groeningen Orgel.</p><p>&gt; Walther received his Buxtehude material directly from<br/>&gt; Werckmeister, personally, in Halberstadt. That Bach<br/>&gt; walked to spend months with Buxtehude&apos;s music is also<br/>&gt; significant.</p><p>Ibo: For what? For what temperament in which organ exactly is it<br/>significant?</p><p>JR: How about in St. Martini in Halberstadt where Werckmeister was organist<br/>for 10 years?  This is also the same city usually credited with introducing<br/>the very keyboard that Werckmeister III tuning is designed for.  Is this only<br/>irony, or a complement by Halberstadters that Werckmeister had the right<br/>stuff for their organ?</p><p>&Oslash; Rather than pine about what we cannot know,</p><p>Ibo: As you do by guessing around on no evidence or worse on mere<br/>personal preference</p><p>JR: There is not only one way.  I am connecting the dots that you  barely<br/>identify.  (Now, don&apos;t get too angry J)</p><p>&gt;&gt; Ibo: But I can&apos;t find any place in Walther&apos;s lexicon,<br/>&gt;&gt; where he explicitly describes any temperament, neither<br/>&gt;&gt; theoretical, nor that it is to be found here or there.</p><p>&gt; JR: It is traditional in the Thuringian/Harz tradition<br/>&gt; not to quote the work of other people when their works<br/>&gt; are published.</p><p>Ibo: Strange, but Walther&apos;s Lexikon (he was from Thuringia) does<br/>exactly what you deny: It constantly quotes and makes references -<br/>however, not to temperaments - sometimes it quotes.<br/>I could easily display hundreds of printed matter from Thuringia<br/>in the 17th and 18 century in which quoting as everywhere else in<br/>a circle of 2000 kms around Thuringia, was done extensively.<br/>Especially, when honoring someone else&apos;s work...</p><p>JR: You misunderstand.  When Thuringian Praetorious wrote about the<br/>organology of instruments, it was enough for later Thuringias to refer to<br/>Praetorious for any serious inquiry on the subject.  After Werckmeister<br/>completed his treatise on temperament, it was to Werckmeister that other<br/>Thuringians (such as Walther) would point.  It was to Walther that we have<br/>the first German music encyclopaedia.  It is with Bach that we have the<br/>music, itself.  None of these good Thuringians felt it wise to out do the<br/>others who had historical precedent on particular musical topics.  It&apos;s just<br/>an observation.</p><p>Ibo: Since you want to write a book about Bach&apos;s tuning, you will do<br/>better in checking some sources from time to time, so that you<br/>avoid all this easily falsifiable statements.</p><p>JR: I&apos;m an American dealing with ancient German jargon in a country that was<br/>only recently (historically speaking, the enemy).  Considering my efforts up<br/>to date, you really owe me an apology.  Rather than embrace my efforts to<br/>explore this &quot;murky&quot; area of musical scholarship, you have been dismissive<br/>and condescending.  I admit to some of the same, especially regarding the<br/>field of &quot;musicology,&quot; which you need not take personally.</p><p>&Oslash; There has been a veil place over Werckmeister and his<br/>&gt; importance to the music that followed.</p><p>Ibo: Which every single modern music dictionary will disqualify as<br/>false staememt, as well as the scientific research on Werckmeister<br/>himself.</p><p>JR: Yes, you must be right, it must be a false &quot;staememt.&quot;  The very fact<br/>that there is no image of Werckmeister&apos;s face is a kind of veil.</p><p>&gt; In the English<br/>&gt; and Dutch speaking work, little has made a proper impact.</p><p>Ibo: No, not true either - The influential Werckmeister publication<br/>(ttransl. by J.W. Lustig) i mentioned already. Then the pioneers<br/>of HIP like Leonhadt, but also their followers Ton Koopman, Bob<br/>von Asperen, plus the work of many organ builders show that<br/>nowadays Werckmeister is used in performance - may be more than in<br/>his days. However, in organs /restorations or &quot;style&quot; copies) it<br/>is almost certainly overused</p><p>JR: You have finally stated your bias.  Good!</p><p>Thanks for your attention<br/>best regards<br/>Ibo Ortgies</p><p>It&apos;s been swell.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
