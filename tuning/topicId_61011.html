Some people<br/>  &gt; apparently take tuning for granted hereabouts and<br/>  &gt; imagine that refined music can be produced in any<br/>  &gt; sound system.</p><p>  But can&apos;t it? I would think it can be. I liked the<br/>  artist&apos;s palette analogy for the temperaments. Sure<br/>  the great music was not BECAUSE of the temperament,<br/>  but, there came a temperament, and then a musician<br/>  created amazing music with the temperament. Or maybe a<br/>  musician created a temperament in order that he could<br/>  create a certain great music with it. So I&apos;m sure<br/>  music in diferent temperaments will be different, but<br/>  can be great in so many different tunings right? I<br/>  would expect that the great composers would still have<br/>  composed great pieces had the temperament been<br/>  different. Surely they would have been totally<br/>  different pieces though, the artist manifesting the<br/>  music appropriate to the medium (temperament).<br/>  Aren&apos;t all the gamelans in Indonesia tuned differently<br/>  from each other? Could they even be a bit random? But<br/>  then, on each gamelan (is that how you spell it?)<br/>  greta (&quot;refined&quot;) music has been developed. And each<br/>  is characteristically different (maybe due to the<br/>  different tuning leading to different characters of<br/>  creation).<br/>  Just some unqualified thoughts<br/>  Justin.</p></div>
