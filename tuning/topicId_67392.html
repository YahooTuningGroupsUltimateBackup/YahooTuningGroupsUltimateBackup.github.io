It may still<br/>need refinement/debugging, but I finally think I&apos;ve got the<br/>right approach.  Comments/corrections greatly appreciated.</p><p>This spreadsheet, like its forebears, shows the error from<br/>JI in each key of 24 different circulating temperaments.  It<br/>offers a choice of 3 different error measures in both the<br/>5- and 7-limits to do so:</p><p>1. pairwise RMS error<br/>In &apos;Schwartz et al - Statistical Structure of Human Speech<br/>Sounds&apos; a large corpus of spoken sounds from a variety of<br/>languages was analyzed for its spectral content.  Harmonics<br/>2-6 were strongest, harmonics 1 and 7 were about half as<br/>strong, and all other harmonics were very weak.  So a choice<br/>between 5- and 7-limit JI seems supported by this study; I<br/>measure the RMS average of the errors of the dyads in an<br/>approximate 2:3:4:5:6 chord for the 5-limit, or a 2:3:4:5:6:7<br/>chord for the 7-limit.</p><p>2. Tenney-weighted error<br/>Tenney Harmonic distance has been found to agree with<br/>psychoacoustic ratings of dyadic dissonance for simple<br/>ratios, and penalizing error more strongly when it effects<br/>more consonant ratios is something that may make sense.  I<br/>use the sum of the absolute values of the Tenney-weighted<br/>errors of the primes 2 3 5 for the 5-limit, and of 2 3 5 7<br/>for the 7-limit.</p><p>3. harmonic entropy<br/>Using data supplied by Paul Erlich for s=1.0 (&apos;harmonic<br/>entropy for acute listeners&apos;), I sum the entropy of the same<br/>dyads used in the RMS calculation (rounded to the nearest<br/>cent) and subtract the entropy of their justly-tuned versions.<br/>This should give the most accurate picture of the dissonance<br/>of the chord of any of these measures (whether or not that<br/>chord reflects what we hear when playing music in a &apos;key&apos; of<br/>a well temperament).</p><p>From an implementation point of view, this spreadsheet is<br/>far better than previous versions.  It uses explicit absolute<br/>and relative references, 3-D references, and smarter formulas<br/>to keep the fields isomorphic.  To say that in English, you<br/>can now add a new well-temperament to the sheet without having<br/>to do a ton of work.</p><p>What conclusions can we reach from the data is this sheet?<br/>Well, I haven&apos;t looked closely at it yet, but these jumped<br/>out at me:</p><p>. Harmonic entropy says that if you&apos;re going to playing in<br/>all keys, your average experience of dissonance will be less<br/>in equal temperament than in any well temperament.  The same<br/>isn&apos;t true for the other error measures.  As long as you don&apos;t<br/>have what George Secor calls &quot;harmonic waste&quot; you can do just<br/>as well on average as in ET.  You can even beat ET in some<br/>cases my using tempered octaves.</p><p>. Flat octaves are better if you believe in RMS, or Tenney<br/>weighting in the 7-limit.  They&apos;re worse if you believe in<br/>harmonic entropy or 5-limit Tenney weighting.</p><p>Note: many of the temperaments on this sheet are specially<br/>designed to do something with beat rates, or to allow<br/>historically-accurate performances.  The sheet doesn&apos;t<br/>reflect these considerations directly.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=67397 href="#67397">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2006 11:45:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Also, the key of F is better than the key of C in most<br/>historical temperaments.  I never knew that.  I always<br/>thought C was supposed to be the best key!</p><p>With my well temperaments I try to favor keys like<br/>D, A, and E because they&apos;re easier to play (at least,<br/>for me) on the piano.
