<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Microstock 5 review</h1><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/1999 8:27:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(I sent this yesterday and it seemed to be eaten; if it appears<br/>twice, my apologies...)</p><p>Microstock 5 was held Saturday, September 18 in Denver.  I met some<br/>other listers in person for the first time, but since I&apos;m apparently the<br/>only list member who did not perform, I&apos;ll take a stab at writing a<br/>quick review.  I&apos;m vague on some particulars, so I hope others will<br/>correct any factual errors I make.</p><p>Neil Haverstick was MC, and was very comfortable in the role.  The<br/>audience was largely composed of greying boomers.  The atmosphere was<br/>casual and relaxed.  Lighting in the church did leave a lot to be<br/>desired: the performers were in half dark, while the one spotlight shown<br/>onto an immovable cross on the wall.  Oh well, we were there for sound,<br/>not sight...</p><p>First Ernie Crews performed on a kind of &quot;jew&apos;s harp&quot;, the exact name of<br/>which I don&apos;t remember.  Program notes, though extra hassle for the<br/>organizers, would help.  It all pretty much sounded like &quot;boing, boing&quot;<br/>to me, but others seemed to take pleasure in the changing overtone<br/>emphasis Ernie produced.</p><p>Ernie then played on a santoor (?), which sounded to me much like a<br/>hammer dulcimer tuned to JI.  His touch was adept and the audience<br/>seemed to be drawn into the piece.</p><p>Well, I wasn&apos;t taking notes - it wasn&apos;t till later that I found out a<br/>volunteer might be needed to review the night.  Neil played some solo<br/>guitar as I recall.  He had several, with and without frets, including<br/>at least one fretted to 34-tET.  As he played I amused myself by working<br/>out the math for 34-tET (no logs, just dividing 1200 cents by 34 and<br/>getting just under 35.3 cents per microtone.  Not a meantone scale: C to<br/>D is 6 steps; D to E is 5.  Fifth, at 20 tones, is about 4 cents long.<br/>Uh-oh: 7/6 and 8/7 both require 7 steps: too bad...).</p><p>Then John Starrett took the stage for, as Neil quipped, &quot;the really<br/>serious music of the evening.&quot;  This involved a lemonica, which is a<br/>couple of citrus fruits impaled on zinc and brass rods, making a small<br/>voltage cell.  The voltage produced controls the frequency of an<br/>oscillator, and the whole thing is effect-processed out the, uhhh, ears.<br/>No, wait, there&apos;s more!  Ernie played the vegephone, which consisted of<br/>many pieces of fruit and vegetables, watermelon down to apple, each with<br/>a microphone surface mounted.  Each vegetable was thumped and/or stroked<br/>to produce percussive sounds.  Neil played one of his guitars.  The<br/>highlight came as Ernie bit into the apple during the performance.  How<br/>can I describe it?  The audience went wild.</p><p>But I left out the part about the star chamber.  No, that&apos;s not it.<br/>StarrBoard.  I&apos;ll let John S describe it.  The sounds were wild, highly<br/>processed, difficult to describe.</p><p>After intermission, Gao Hong closed out the evening with a heartfelt<br/>performance on the pipa, a lute-like instrument, which she rested, neck<br/>up, in her lap.  She was irresistible: centered, modest, soft-spoken,<br/>but clearly in love with her work.  Successful too, as far as I could<br/>tell.  The presence of all us half-grubby, half-scruffy greybeards<br/>didn&apos;t seem to bother her in the least.  She let her passion flow into<br/>the instrument, and it was electrifying.</p><p>It seemed to me as if all pieces played on the pipa use the same low<br/>sort of drone note.  I wonder if the ear would tire of that one note and<br/>long for another.</p><p>Many hung around talk to Gao, but I was bushed and had an hour&apos;s drive<br/>back to Longmont.  Neil: you took up your CD&apos;s before I had a chance<br/>to buy one; I&apos;ll catch you next time.  And come back to the list,<br/>willya?  Past, begone!</p><p>The evening was enjoyable and I look forward to next year&apos;s<br/>performances!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jadl@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/19/1999 4:25:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Microstock 5 was held Saturday, September 18 in Denver.
