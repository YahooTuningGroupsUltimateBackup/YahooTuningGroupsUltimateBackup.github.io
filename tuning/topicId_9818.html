[snip] In unaccompanied<br/>&gt; singing without a drone, is the difference even between 9/8 and 10/9<br/>going<br/>&gt; to effect the experience of the music? [snip]<br/>&gt; Could we possibly percieve tuning in remembered pitches?<br/>&gt;  How can tuning happen linearly?  Any feelings?</p><p>Here&apos;s a good one: What do you get when you cross a harmony with a<br/>rhythm?</p><p>Melody and harmony (and rhythm) are not necessarily as distinct as we<br/>have come to view them in Western music theory.  The tendency of the<br/>West is to dissect, which can be helpful as long as you keep in mind<br/>that the parts synergistically make up the whole.  Melody, even<br/>unaccompanied, can be seen as the product, or intersection, of harmony<br/>and rhythm.  Take a scale - an abstract set of pitches which harmonize<br/>with each other to varying degrees - and intone them one at a time in a<br/>rhythm: that&apos;s the backbone of melody.  Conversely, take any bare melody<br/>and reduce it to its scale and its tuning: that&apos;s the backbone of<br/>harmony.  None of the three can exist as music without the others.  If<br/>you care for mystical connections to music theory, this is a true<br/>reflection of the principle of the Trinity combined with the symbolism<br/>of the Cross.</p><p>Now to the question of how tuning affects the performance of<br/>unaccompanied melody.  On this I have only my experiences and<br/>perceptions to go on.  For me, even the subtlest of tuning differences<br/>alter, to a corresponding degree, the color of the emotional content.<br/>The difference between 9:8 and 10:9 in a melodic figure is one that<br/>really jumps out at me sometimes.  The effect depends on the context,<br/>including the vertical direction of the melody at the moment, the part<br/>of the phrase the tone is found in, the size of the steps or leaps from<br/>which is it approached and whence it departs, and the tuning of the rest<br/>of the scale.  But very generally in diatonic contexts, a 9:8 offers a<br/>strong stance with a bright solid color, while a 10:9 gives a more<br/>subtle, plaintive, slippery or gooey feeling with a darker, softer, and<br/>more muted color.  Again, just my perception.</p><p>For those who occasionally communicate with me off-list, please note the<br/>new email address.

Is it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;not by incrementing off of the previous note?  So, if I&apos;m singing a &apos;C&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;at, say, 256 Hz, then I would increment this frequency by 1+1/9, at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;arrive at my &apos;D&apos; of 288 Hz (to the best of my ability).   Others, when<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;singing a tune to the Ptolemaic syntonon diatonic, we&apos;ll increment up;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;1+1/10; and if singing to the Zalzal&apos;s intonation, we&apos;ll go up 1+1/11.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Clearly someone can sing a tune without harmony.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, but most of the world&apos;s melodic tunings do not conform to your<br/>&gt; &gt; logic above.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I&apos;d like to expand upon this concept some.  The Ancient Greeks developed<br/>*instrumental* tunings (via the monochord, et. al.), and this would serve<br/>as an accompaniment to voice.  This tuning, it seems, is uncritically<br/>applied to vocal tunings.  While the monochord division allows for complex<br/>division of the octave, a vocalist does not have the facility to generate<br/>such complex tones,  Rather, he is consigned to singing simple tones, +/-<br/>the best that he can produce them.  I have not seen this distinction made<br/>between instrumental &amp; vocal tunings.</p><p>One  reference documents which suggested this this conclusion to me is a<br/>PhD dissertation done in the 1960&apos;s on the vocal music of the Arab<br/>Christians in Jerusalem and its environs.  The reseacher used a &quot;melograph&quot;<br/>to plot the intervals of various chanters and clerics (=informants) for the<br/>purpose of  characterize the tunings in use.  The reseacher notes that<br/>often the tunings used were inconsistent from &quot;informant&quot; to &quot;informant&quot;;<br/>and even for repeat performances of the same informant.  He concludes by<br/>calling into question the tetrachordal basis of the music.</p><p>But consider, these chants use intervals that differ from Ptolemy&apos;s<br/>syntonic diatonic (PSD), in particular, the use of neutral tones (e.g.,<br/>12/11 = 151c) and small minor tones (e.g., 11/10 = 165c).  These tones,<br/>less than the 10/9 of PSD, partly provide for the &apos;oriental&apos; feel of this<br/>music. (Confer also the minor tone in Ptolemy&apos;s equable diatonic).</p><p>Now consider:  let us say that a chanter with drone wants to proceed with<br/>Al Sibn&apos;s (fl. c. 1100?) tuning of :  9/8, 12/11, 88/81 (204c, 151c, 143c).<br/> His cumulative intervals, if he were an instrument and not a human, would<br/>be 9/8, 27/22, 4/3.   Now, I understand that the tone 27/22 is too complex<br/>(per tonal entropy) for him to be able to  tune his voice to hit that<br/>interval with the drone . So, likely he will land on 11/9ths, (making his<br/>step up from 9/8 to be 88/81, 143c., (a step too complex for him to make<br/>without harmonic assistance).  So, for vocalist&apos;s tunings, the actual<br/>tuning of this scale turned out to be 9/8, 88/81, 12/11.  His intended<br/>tetrachordal with the last two intervals interchanged!   Thus for<br/>monophonic or drone singing,  these two tetrachords are equivalent.</p><p>Recall,  that our chanter, if chanting without the instrumental<br/>accompaniment could not sing Al Sibn&apos;s intervals to begin with--being<br/>unable to accurately judge the size of the 88/81 step.  He might sing,<br/>instead, 9/8, 12/11, 13/12 (cumm=9/8, 27/22, 117/88 = 204c, 355c, 493c).<br/>This would be heard by him and his audience as  9/8, 11/9, 4/3).  So this<br/>too, is equivalent.</p><p>Re-capping the findings, the tetrachords:</p><p>9/8, 12/11, 88/81    (cumm= 9/8,  27/22,       4/3;  204c, 355c, 498c)<br/>9/8, 88/81, 12/11    (cumm= 9/8,   11/9,        4/3;  204c, 347c, 498c)<br/>9/8, 12/11, 13/12    (cumm=9/8,   27/22, 117/88;  204c, 355c, 493c)</p><p>Note that while the 3rd tetrachord cited above with 493c is shy of the<br/>perfect 4th, other possible combinations, like:</p><p>9/8, 11/10, 13/12   (cumm= 9/8,   99/80, 429/320; 204c, 369c, 507c).</p><p>will yield a tetrachord (507c) that is greater than a perfect fourth.  This<br/>too, I suggest is an equivalent tetrachord.</p><p>Our poor 60&apos;s researcher may have been befuddled by his readings on the<br/>&quot;melograph&quot;, seeing all these as &quot;different tunings&quot; and even tetrachords<br/>not based on perfect 4ths.  The the reality of how a chanter can chain his<br/>intervals together unaccompanied, and what &quot;harmonic points&quot; are available<br/>to him with a drone, provides an important consideration.</p><p>If I am mistaken here, I would appreciate being corrected at this early<br/>point, before I get to confident in this.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Polychroni</p></div><h3><a id=9855 href="#9855">ðŸ”—</a>Polychroni &#x3C;UPB_MONIODIS@ONLINE.EMICH.EDU&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/2000 6:07:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #ddd'><b>Attachments</b></div><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'></div>
