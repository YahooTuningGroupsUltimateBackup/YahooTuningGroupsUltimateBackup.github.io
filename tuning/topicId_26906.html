It asks the question, &quot;how confused is<br/>my brain when it hears an interval?&quot; It assumes only one parameter in<br/>answering this question.</p><p>Our _brain_ determines what pitch we&apos;ll hear when we listen to a<br/>sound. It does so by trying to match the frequencies in the sound&apos;s<br/>spectrum (timbre) with a harmonic series. The pitch we hear is high<br/>or low depending on whether the frequency of the fundamental of the<br/>best-fit harmonic series is high or low. The pitch corresponding to<br/>the fundamental itself need not be physically present in the sound.<br/>Sometimes, the meaning of &quot;best-fit&quot; will not be clear and we&apos;ll hear<br/>more than one pitch. This happens when several tones are playing<br/>together, or when the spectrum of the instrument is highly inharmonic.</p><p>Entropy is a mathematical measure of disorder, or confusion. For a<br/>dyad, consisting of two tones which are sine waves or have harmonic<br/>spectra, one can immediately understand the behavior of the harmonic<br/>entropy function. The brain&apos;s attempt to fit the stimulus to a<br/>harmonic series is quite unambiguous when the ratio between the<br/>frequencies is a simple one, such as 2:1 or 3:2. More complex ratios,<br/>or irrational ones far enough from any simple one, and the limited<br/>resolution with which the brain receives frequency information makes<br/>it harder for it to be sure about how to fit the stimulus into a<br/>harmonic series. The resolution mentioned is parameterized by the<br/>variable s. A computer program is used to calculate the entropy for<br/>every possible interval (in, say, 1&cent; increments). The set of<br/>potential &quot;fitting&quot; ratios is chosen to be large enough (by going<br/>high enough in the harmonic series) so that further enlargements of<br/>the set cease to affect the basic shape of the harmonic entropy curve.</p><p>You can see some examples at</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/het01_16.j">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/het01_16.j</a><br/>pg</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/t2_015_13p">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/t2_015_13p</a><br/>2877.jpg (the &quot;weighting&quot; referred to here is not a weighting of<br/>anything in the model but merely refers to a computational shortcut<br/>used).</p><p>Considering ratios to be different if they are not in lowest terms<br/>(appropriate, for example, if we assume 6:3 might be interpreted as<br/>the sixth and third harmonics, rather than simply as a 2:1 ratio)<br/>leads to this slightly different appearance:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/t3_01_13p2">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy/files/dyadic/t3_01_13p2</a><br/>877.jpg</p><p>Certain chords of three or more notes blend so well that it sounds<br/>like fewer notes are playing than there actually are. We hear<br/>a &quot;root&quot; which is kind of the overall pitch of the chord, and the<br/>most stable bass note for it. The harmonic entropy of these chords<br/>(which is not a function of the harmonic entropies of the intervals<br/>in the chord) is low.</p><p>Our non-laboratory experiments on the harmonic entropy list seem to<br/>conclusively show that the dissonance of a chord can&apos;t be even close<br/>to a function of the dissonances of the constituent intervals. For<br/>example, everyone put the 4:5:6:7 chord near the top of their ranking<br/>of 36 recorded tetrads from least to most dissonant, while everyone<br/>put 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 much lower. These two chords have the same<br/>intervals. Therefore, it seems to be the case that dissonance<br/>measures which are functions of dyadic (intervallic) dissonance<br/>account for, at best, a relatively small portion of the dissonance of<br/>chords. Such measures include those of Plomp and Levelt, Kameoka and<br/>Kuriyagawa, and Sethares.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in discussing further, please join the harmonic<br/>entropy group, which has 37 members so far:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/harmonic_entropy</a></p><p>______________________________________________________________________</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>8/10/2001 9:03:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Harmonic entropy is the simplest possible model of consonance.<br/>...</p><p>A brilliant summary.
