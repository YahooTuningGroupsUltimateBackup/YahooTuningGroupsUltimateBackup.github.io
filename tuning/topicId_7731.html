But I<br/>&gt; gather that there are two parts to the question:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. How much tuning resolution can the synth address -- how much does it<br/>&gt; even attempt to produce?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. How closely does the sound played actually match the note the synth is<br/>&gt; trying to play.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To answer the first part, you&apos;ve got to decide how you want to send the<br/>&gt; tuning information to the synth -- pitch bend or sysex?  Pitch bend works<br/>&gt; on all synths, and the resolution is potentially very great, but most<br/>&gt; synths ignore at least some of the pitch bend resolution.  I don&apos;t know<br/>&gt; which ones are good at this.  Usually, working with pitch bends is awkward<br/>&gt; -- to my knowledge, all the musicians who have successfully used pitch<br/>&gt; bends for tuning have controlled their synth from a PC, using software they<br/>wrote.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The far more popular and easier option is sysex.  To find out about the<br/>&gt; sysex tuning capability of a synth, I always consult the microtonal<br/>&gt; synthesis web site...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal/">http://home.att.net/~microtonal/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The two most flexible designs are the Kurzweil K2000/K2500/K2600, and the<br/>&gt; Emu Audity 2000 / Proteus 2000.  The Kurzweil units accept tuning data in<br/>&gt; 1-cent increments, and the Emu units accept data in 1.56-cent increments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then there is Kyma, from Symbolic Sound.  It requires a PC, and costs about<br/>&gt; $3300 for an entry unit.  It allows arbitrary precision of tuning data.</p><p>&gt; Answering the second part is more tricky.  There was a discussion here a<br/>&gt; while back about wavetable synths delivering poor and inconsistent<br/>&gt; accuracy.  I wasn&apos;t involved in this discussion, so I can&apos;t tell you much<br/>&gt; about it.  But to my knowledge, the most accurate synth as far as producing<br/>&gt; what it&apos;s trying to produce (that&apos;s the second part), is again Kyma.<br/>&gt; Supposedly, it&apos;s never off by more than 0.0026Hz.</p><p>That price tag is what I feared. I&apos;ll put my money, such as it is, on human<br/>ears. They&apos;re handier, a lot less expensive, and amazingly accurate given<br/>sufficient experience.</p><p>&gt;&gt;And even more reluctant to get into &quot;log-accuracy.&quot; The phrase &quot;over<br/>&gt;&gt;my head&quot; comes to mind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, cents are a logarithmic measure of frequency.  You know, to add two<br/>&gt; ratios (like 5/4 and 5/3) you multiply them (25/12).  But to add to<br/>&gt; intervals in cents (386 and 884), you add them (1270).  Deal is, if a synth<br/>&gt; is off by 1 cent, that could be 0.064 hertz at A=110, or it could be 1.017<br/>&gt; hertz at A=1760.  So if you&apos;re mis-tuning a just ratio way down low in the<br/>&gt; frequency range by 1 cent, you&apos;ll have to listen much longer to hear a beat<br/>&gt; than you would mistuning by 1 cent in the upper range.  If a synth was off<br/>&gt; by a certain number of hertz, that would be many cents down low, but few<br/>&gt; cents up high.  Most synths are accurate in cents as far as what they&apos;re<br/>&gt; trying to do (first part), and in hertz as far as what they&apos;re actually<br/>&gt; doing (second part).  Follow?</p><p>Actually, yes.</p><p>&gt;&gt;May I assume that your input here, Carl, is to improve my faulty concept<br/>&gt;&gt;(which it does) of the limitations of MIDI and not to stifle my complaints<br/>&gt;&gt;about the inadequacy of 100 cent increments to match what the ear can hear?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure.  Keep in mind that 100-cent increments is 12tET.  I took you<br/>&gt; to mean 1-cent increments.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>&gt; When tuning notes of the same timbre, in the<br/>&gt; most sensitive range of the ear, differences of less than a cent in a<br/>&gt; harmony can be heard, as piano tuners prove every day.  But to hear<br/>&gt; mistuning at this level requires a trained ear, and careful listening.  In<br/>&gt; a musical situation, such small mistunings come across as a _subtle_ change<br/>&gt; in timbre.  Nevertheless, it is one which piano lovers and audiophiles can<br/>&gt; hear -- it has been said that a good tuning &quot;brings the piano to life&quot;.</p><p>I am beginning to realize that my penchant for &quot;pure&quot; tunings, likely<br/>fostered by my affection for barbershop and vocal jazz, may not be the ideal<br/>for all musical styles. An opera chorus, for example, might be less exciting<br/>if pure tunings were the top priority (although I generally have wished for<br/>better phrasing and vowel focus from most of those I have heard).</p><p>&gt; I would encourage you to discover exactly what the accuracy of the synth is<br/>&gt; question was, and to qualify your statements by answering questions like,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What type of music was I listening to?<br/>&gt; What limit was the harmony?<br/>&gt; What timbre was being used?<br/>&gt; How did the mis-tuning sound to me?<br/>&gt; Was this a blind test?</p><p>Thank you very much, Carl, and I appreciate the time and effort it took for<br/>your response.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
