With Max it should be easy<br/>enough to roll your own version of this to use your synth&apos;s tuning tables,<br/>rather than pitch bends.&quot;</p><p>I gave it some more thought, and it dawned on me (talk about being slow)<br/>that in *some* cases you don&apos;t need Max or anything else other than your<br/>controller &amp; synth.</p><p>But only IF your synth has tuning tables &amp; velocity switching/crossfading.<br/>AND those tuning tables can be programmed individually for each sound<br/>patch/program. All you have to do is set it up so you switch programs, and<br/>thereby, tunings, according to the velocity your controller is sending out.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if there are many synths out there that have this.<br/>They mostly seem to store the tuning table (in some cases lke Ensoniq only 1<br/>table) at the global level, or channel level (like Roland GS &amp; Yamaha XG),<br/>and not able to store different tunings as part of the patch/program.</p><p>Anyone here know if Roland&apos;s JV series synths store the tuning tables at the<br/>patch level ?</p><p>Otherwise you&apos;d need at least 2 synths &amp; an external hardware (like Opcode&apos;s<br/>Studio 5LX @US$779) /software (like Max) MIDI processor to do the switching.<br/>But then the cost builds up to the might-as-well-get-a-Kyma level.</p><p>Kurzweils are a candidate, but only ET ? Loffink explained it to me once,<br/>but I lost all the valuable exchanges I&apos;ve had with many of you when my<br/>drive went the way of the dodo. Speaking of synths, I think the Roland PMA-5<br/>PDA-like device may be the world&apos;s smallest microtonal synth. Amazing.</p><p>Salut,<br/>- Drew</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
