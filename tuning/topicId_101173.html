We&apos;re spending all of this<br/>time on this list because we want people to get smarter, not dumber.<br/>That&apos;s the goal, that&apos;s why I&apos;m spending incalculable hours of my life<br/>on this list and on Facebook, when I should be out getting drunk or<br/>getting laid or doing what every other 23 year old is doing. We&apos;re all<br/>driven by some sort of obsessive desire to advance the musical<br/>paradigm, and to connect music and science in a way that hasn&apos;t<br/>seriously been done since the theorists of the Renaissance era, and so<br/>we continue. And inasmuch as our actions pertain to Wikipedia, we&apos;re<br/>trying to improve it by extending the scope of the world&apos;s knowledge,<br/>which so far, in this area, has been driven entirely by a grassroots<br/>effort existing on tiny mailing lists on the internet.</p><p>Now then.

If the rules<br/>truly prevent you from improving the encyclopedia, ignore them.&quot;<br/>&quot;Don&apos;t follow written instructions mindlessly, but rather, consider<br/>how the encyclopedia is improved or damaged by each edit.&quot;<br/>&quot;The spirit of the rule trumps the letter of the rule. The common<br/>purpose of building a free encyclopedia trumps both. If this common<br/>purpose is better served by ignoring the letter of a particular rule,<br/>then that rule should be ignored.&quot;<br/>&quot;Each individual case will have its own context. While the rules are<br/>useful for the most common circumstances, often there is no hard and<br/>fast rule that can be applied.&quot;</p><p>Here&apos;s a really nice quote:<br/>&quot;For example, whether a small press publication can be considered a<br/>reliable source depends on a number of factors. Does the publishing<br/>house have a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy? Is the author<br/>a notable or respected expert in relation to the subject of the work?&quot;</p><p>In the case of the xenwiki, the answer is yes. Gene keeps an eye on<br/>this stuff like a hawk. He took off something that Kraig said about<br/>the melodic implications of the tonality diamond that wasn&apos;t<br/>explained. Gene himself is an authoritative expert on the subject, and<br/>this has been recognized within Wikipedia itself. So yes.</p><p>The point is that this is a clear case in which IAR should apply.<br/>We&apos;re not trying to get our stuff on Wikipedia to promote or sell<br/>anything; we&apos;re doing it to try and improve the encylopedia. This is<br/>an extremely specialized field, and every one of those is going to<br/>have its quirks where IAR should take precedence. In this case, our<br/>&quot;quirk&quot; is that the notability criteria need to be adjusted to be more<br/>appropriate to the field. It&apos;s rather simple and the only reason that<br/>it&apos;s NOT happening is that the people that Gene called &quot;deletionists&quot;<br/>don&apos;t understand the situation, and on some level, fetishize<br/>Wikipedia&apos;s rules in a way that IAR was designed to subvert.</p><p>Well, gee, when you look at it through that frame, it looks a lot<br/>different, don&apos;t it?</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=101189 href="#101189">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2011 1:17:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; No but ok, seriously.

Paul&apos;s been on here,<br/>Gene&apos;s been on here, Sethares has been on here, Chalmers has been on<br/>here. The tuning list has been quoted as a cited source on Wikipedia<br/>before. Sethares has cited Paul&apos;s work on HE and so has one of my<br/>teachers from UM now in his Stanford Ph. D dissertation. I dunno what<br/>other evidence you would need to establish that a mailing list<br/>contains academic value other than that. Obviously we&apos;re not going to<br/>get a situation where academia is quoting the tuning list left and<br/>right, because if we were then the debate over whether IAR should<br/>apply would be moot. The point of IAR is that every subfield has its<br/>quirks, and you should ignore the rules when a particular quirk of<br/>some subfield runs counter to the ultimate goal of improving the<br/>encyclopedia.

If they were familiar<br/>with it, then they&apos;d know to apply IAR in this case. The fact that<br/>people who don&apos;t know anything about microtonal music are policing the<br/>microtonal music pages for rule violations is the problem. This means<br/>they won&apos;t know when and when not to apply IAR, and furthermore IAR<br/>was designed as a way to stop people from doing this.</p><p>The real problem is that laypeople who aren&apos;t familiar with the field<br/>of microtonal music are policing the microtonal pages with a one size<br/>fits all rules-driven paradigm that isn&apos;t what the Wikipedia founders<br/>intended. They do it, on some level, because of a fetishism about<br/>Wikipedia, and because they believe that simply applying the rules<br/>systematically and algorithmically will yield the best organization of<br/>the sum of the world&apos;s knowledge. In the real world, a little bit more<br/>finesse is required when tackling the encyclopedization of a field of<br/>knowledge; IAR indicates that the founders were well aware of this.</p><p>&gt; As an example, take Mario and his &quot;true octave&quot;.

I&apos;ve long said that notability and<br/>related rules are essentially a contrivance to prevent<br/>flame wars.  If you examine wikipedia, you find it has<br/>ample resources for truth-divination, and in fact relies<br/>on them.  The intersection of content that&apos;s true and<br/>content that has a truly effective citation is rather<br/>small, yet overwhelmingly, content on wikipedia is true.<br/>Even the notion that it&apos;s an encyclopedia is a<br/>contrivance.  It&apos;s a truth engine, and by now has a<br/>tremendous responsibility to stop denying it.  If it<br/>really wants to outsource consensus-building discussion<br/>to listservs like these, it should at least allow (and<br/>indeed, favor) citations to them.</p><p>I came by an interesting case in 2006.  There was a bunch<br/>of published material - by doctors, law enforcement, etc -<br/>claiming that the street drug &quot;embalming fluid&quot; *is*<br/>embalming fluid.  And no published work stating that it<br/>is PCP.  Examination of the sources revealed the truth<br/>beyond a doubt.  Truth finally prevailed, but for a long<br/>time the wrong statement persisted, and my edits were<br/>initially rebuffed.</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Embalming_chemicals#.22wet.22">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Embalming_chemicals#.22wet.22</a></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Embalming_fluid">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Embalming_fluid</a></p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Beefman#PCP_section">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Beefman#PCP_section</a></p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=101225 href="#101225">ðŸ”—</a>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2011 4:36:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As an example, take Mario and his &quot;true octave&quot;.

I think that an octave of 2/1 is correct and Mario&apos;s octave is incorrect and has no logical basis in anything.</p><p>But this is irrelevant to Wikipedia policy. There are two unrelated criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia that you seem to be confusing with each other. One is notability: does the topic have broad enough interest to belong in a general encyclopedia? Another is verifiability: Are there reliable sources making this same claim that can be referred to if there are disputes of fact?</p><p>Note that for Wikipedia, there is no criterion of &quot;truth&quot;. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability,_not_truth">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability,_not_truth</a> . I believe the point of this is that people of course believe different things to be true, and trying to establish truth by a consensus process would never work because people in general hold their beliefs pretty strongly, even if they&apos;re false.</p><p>But the idea is that, even if different editors cannot possibly agree on what the truth is, they might at least agree on what positions are expressed in any sources in question, what positions have consensus in different communities, and so on. So the criterion is &quot;verifiability&quot; in order for there to be some possibility of an end to constant, unproductive edit wars.</p><p>If you want an encyclopedia or some other website that has &quot;truth&quot; as a criterion for something to appear in it, ***that website is not Wikipedia***.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=101226 href="#101226">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/14/2011 5:08:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If you want an encyclopedia or some other website that has &quot;truth&quot;<br/>&gt; as a criterion for something to appear in it, ***that website is<br/>&gt; not Wikipedia***.</p><p>This is a complete fantasy, that neither represents what<br/>wikipedia is nor what people us it for.

Almost.<br/>---------------------<br/>As respect to your second paragraph all of us can make a simple experiment, as I did it. Before doing the experiment it is absolutely necessary to get an acoustical guitar, standard dimensions with open string lenghts of about 26 inch. The only string to be used is the first string which is approximately tuned to 330 Hz. Measurements in millimeters or equivalent to 0.04 of an inch precision approx.</p><p>You should use a precision electronic counter (7 digits display or better) + microphone.</p><p>Once the tuned first string is stabilized, the open string frequency should be measured, the average of measurements should be registered. Let us suppose that it is 330 Hz, exactly. Stop the string just at the middle of the open lenght. If the open lenght is 26 inches the stop should be placed exactly at 13 in. To stop the string at the middle, the finger must be replaced by a metallic thin plate.Then, a softly pluck to the string, not less than 5 plucks. The resulting average frequency should be done by our great friend Keenan Peeper whereas instead of measuring the 150 Hz given by the theoretical octave (2/1) he would read a slightly lower frequency since the real toctave rules the experiment.</p><p>My computer enters to maintenance</p><p>Mario</p><p>August, 18</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Mike Battaglia<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: Sunday, August 14, 2011 8:29 PM<br/>  Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Xenwiki on Wikipedia</p><p>  On Aug 14, 2011, at 8:00 AM, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>    &quot;Keenan Pepper&quot; &lt;keenanpepper@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>    Why aren&apos;t you calling Mario a crackpot?

It&apos;s a kind of<br/>&gt;&gt; intellectual relativism, where everybody&apos;s ideas must be of<br/>&gt;&gt; equal value.  To produce excellent theory we have to be<br/>&gt;&gt; open to criticism.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m certainly not an intellectual relativist. I think that an octave of &gt; 2/1 is correct and Mario&apos;s octave is incorrect and has no logical basis in &gt; anything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But this is irrelevant to Wikipedia policy. There are two unrelated &gt; criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia that you seem to be confusing with &gt; each other. One is notability: does the topic have broad enough interest &gt; to belong in a general encyclopedia? Another is verifiability: Are there &gt; reliable sources making this same claim that can be referred to if there &gt; are disputes of fact?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that for Wikipedia, there is no criterion of &quot;truth&quot;. See &gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability,_not_truth">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability,_not_truth</a> . I &gt; believe the point of this is that people of course believe different &gt; things to be true, and trying to establish truth by a consensus process &gt; would never work because people in general hold their beliefs pretty &gt; strongly, even if they&apos;re false.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But the idea is that, even if different editors cannot possibly agree on &gt; what the truth is, they might at least agree on what positions are &gt; expressed in any sources in question, what positions have consensus in &gt; different communities, and so on. So the criterion is &quot;verifiability&quot; in &gt; order for there to be some possibility of an end to constant, unproductive &gt; edit wars.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you want an encyclopedia or some other website that has &quot;truth&quot; as a &gt; criterion for something to appear in it, ***that website is not &gt; Wikipedia***.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keenan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;  <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

When I listened to<br/>&gt; Mario&apos;s tuning, it sounded pleasantly bright, &lt;bright in the same way that I<br/>&gt; prefer stretched octaves. I haven&apos;t read Terhardt&apos;s work but if you say that<br/>&gt; the addition of &lt;harmonics causes a tone to drop in pitch, that would be<br/>&gt; perfectly in line with all this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;Do I think it so happens that the perfect chroma match point for all human<br/>&gt; beings is octave is 2/1 * 2 schismas and 1/8 of a &lt;Pythagorean comma? Of<br/>&gt; course not. Do I think this value is the &quot;true octave?&quot; No. But when people<br/>&gt; say &quot;the octave is &lt;2/1,&quot; and assume an unyielding view that states that<br/>&gt; this interval has its ultimate origin in mathematics, and that its<br/>&gt; perception &lt;is unclouded by auditory system nonlinearities and other<br/>&gt; intricacies of psychoacoustics, that&apos;s equally silly...

No in music evidently.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Mario</p></div>
