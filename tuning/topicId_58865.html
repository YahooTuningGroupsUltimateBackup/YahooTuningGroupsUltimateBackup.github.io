(See Equation 3.11.)  &gt;D&apos;Alembert also created a purely mathematical model to show that &gt;standing waves in strings are caused by the superposition of &gt;traveling waves that propagate in opposite directions.<br/>&gt;(See Chapter 3, Figure 6.)  This principle applies to all acoustic &gt;sound-producing systems.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;******************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;D&apos;Alembert&apos;s famous solution of the _wave equation_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;c(t) = _| ( T / Mul)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;states:  The speed of transverse waves in a string equals the &gt;quantity of the square root of the string Tension divided by the &gt;string Mass per unit length.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The following quote is from -- University Physics, 7th ed. Addison-<br/>&gt;Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, Massachusetts, 1988.  -- &gt;one of the finest physics textbooks used throughout the US:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;******************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;p. 501:  &quot;The wave speed ( c ) is the same for all frequencies.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;******************************<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Since c(t) is the same for all frequencies, the tension ( T ) must be &gt;constant for all frequencies, and, therefore, does not and cannot &gt;change;  and the mass per unit length ( Mul ) must also be &gt;constant for all frequencies, and, therefore, does not and cannot &gt;change.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In Equation ii, the quantity [ 2*L / (n) ] describes how -- due to the &gt;superposition of transverse traveling waves propagating in &gt;opposite directions -- the wavelengths of the upper modes of &gt;vibrations _decrease_ in length.

Maybe all you need is Cantor&apos;s theorem or something.<br/>The laws of Thermodynamics just make things worse.</p><p>What is it Gene? You know what we&apos;re talking about here don&apos;t you? It<br/>might be characterised as &quot;the immeasurability of (numerical)<br/>rationality&quot;, or &quot;there&apos;s always one more decimal place&quot;, or &quot;no<br/>matter how irrational your number and no matter how precise your<br/>tolerance there&apos;s always a ratio closer to it than your tolerance&quot;.</p><p>It just seems self-evident to me, but maybe there&apos;s some way to make<br/>it clearer to people.</p><p>But then we have people who understand this but then say that it<br/>doesn&apos;t matter, because what determines whether an interval is just or<br/>not is someone&apos;s _intention_.

Even though the tuner misunderstood me and<br/>actually tuned it to 12-equal. No, it will become clear that it is not<br/>5-limit-JI the moment I start playing it.</p><p>So there must be some criteria for success or otherwise in _realising_<br/>the intention. Maybe in the case of a piano you would consider the<br/>intention to have been realised if it was within say +-2 cents, or<br/>maybe you&apos;re incredibly strict and insist on +- 0.2 cents (and so must<br/>have it retuned immediately before every performance), but whatever<br/>the case you must accept some tolerance. Since you are unwilling to<br/>allow infinite _time_ for frequency measurements to be made, then you<br/>must accept finite accuracy (this is the classical uncertainty principle).</p><p>But what if instead of 5-limit JI I _intend_ the piano (which a moment<br/>ago everyone agreed was tuned to an exceedingly accurate 12-equal) to<br/>be tuned to certain complex rational ratios which differ from<br/>theoretical 12-equal only in the hundredth decimal place of cents?<br/>Does it then become a JI piano?</p><p>Or is it the intention of the composer of the piece being played that<br/>determines whether it is JI or not? Or the intention of the designer<br/>of the rational scale that the composer chose to use (without<br/>understanding anything about ratios)? Or the intention of the<br/>performer, or the intentions of each listener individually?</p><p>Or is it the instrument tuner&apos;s intention that matters? Must I call<br/>the tuner back and give her the list of ratios and ask her to retune<br/>it to those ratios, even though when she gets out her calculator and<br/>does the necessary calculations she is going to give me some funny<br/>looks and tell me that the piano is already tuned to those ratios.</p><p>Must I insist that she first mistune it and then retune it with the<br/>_intention_ that it be tuned to those ratios, and if she says that she<br/>somehow just can&apos;t seem to muster up that intention because she<br/>_knows_ she will actually be tuning it to 12-equal, should I find<br/>another tuner (who might lie about this so as to get the job).</p><p>Doesn&apos;t it seem like there is something just a little bit wrong with<br/>basing determinations of justness solely on _intention_ to tune by<br/>rational ratios (no matter how complex).</p><p>Intention is important in a court of law regarding the difference<br/>between murder and manslaughter, but the intended victim still<br/>actually has to be measurably dead for it to be called murder. Whereas<br/>&quot;a measurably rational number&quot; is an oxymoron.</p><p>As monz mentioned, although one can&apos;t tell by measurement, it is<br/>possible to know that two frequencies are related by a strictly<br/>rational ratio if one know that they are produced by a mechanism that<br/>logically guarantees this, such as digital counters with a common<br/>clock, or even an acoustic instrument that uses resonators to extract<br/>different harmonics from a single continuously-driven oscillator such<br/>as bowed string or wind.</p><p>But if we were to insist that henceforth only such instruments could<br/>be called JI we&apos;d be flying in the face of an awful lot of historical<br/>usage of the term. And there&apos;s also the point that when one combines<br/>notes which are completely phase-locked like this, it can sound more<br/>like one is just creating different timbres rather than intervals or<br/>chords.

In principle one would have to test every<br/>human being on the planet to see if they can detect it, and maybe<br/>you&apos;ll say that with new humans being born all the time you never know<br/>when one will be born that can detect it, but surely this is all<br/>irrelevant because the great mass of any audience will have<br/>discimination within 3 standard deviations of the average, and we<br/>already have a good-enough idea what that discrimination is like.</p><p>Science might currently be unduly pessimistic and be putting the<br/>figure too high, but that doesn&apos;t mean there is no such figure. Pick a<br/>number for the smallest significant mistuning as low as you like,<br/>except zero, and my argument still stands.</p><p>&gt; Also as i pointed out in my last post is<br/>&gt; that 12 ET is not always tuned any more exact than JI so .0006 might<br/>not<br/>&gt; be what one would end up with if one tuned up both.</p><p>I totally agree. But if they are both likely to end up a cent or two<br/>away from theoretical, doesn&apos;t that make such a distinction (between a<br/>12-equal major third and a supposedly JI 504:635) seem even less<br/>meaningful?</p><p>&gt;  The tuning world already got bitten on the ass for assuming the 768<br/>was<br/>&gt; as fine of resolution one needed.</p><p>Sure. That was bad, and a measure of the cost/benefit tradeoff at the<br/>time. But that doesn&apos;t mean that no sufficiently fine resolution exists.</p><p>&gt;  Even those who objected did not know for sure exactly what would<br/>happen<br/>&gt; until it was done.<br/>&gt; Until it is done and observed, we do not know</p><p>True, but by going a factor of a thousand (or a million or whatever)<br/>beyond anything anyone can imagine mattering, we can be pretty damn sure.</p><p>&gt;  The idea that JI must be tunable by ear. there is no such stipulation<br/>&gt; about ET. What if i said that ET can only be tuned by machine which is<br/>&gt; just as reasonable, well throw out all those guitars (which i have to<br/>&gt; say as an aside, is one the worse instrument to realize a tuning,<br/>though<br/>&gt; i can be done) .</p><p>The phrase &quot;tuning by ear&quot; is not the whole of my proposed definition<br/>of justness (far from it). I merely used it as a snappy phrase to<br/>distinguish it from the main alternative &quot;tuning by ratios&quot;, which is<br/>why I placed both in scare-quotes.</p><p>I am aware that it needs many conditions and caveats to make it a<br/>useful defintion. I have mentioned several on this list recently.</p><p>At the moment I&apos;d just be happy if I could convince people that the<br/>&quot;tuning by ratios&quot; definition has a serious problem.</p><p>I personally love that special sound that you only get from just<br/>intervals and chords, I don&apos;t expect a piece to consist of nothing<br/>but, but if I pay for a CD or attend concert that claims to present<br/>music in just intonation, I expect to hear at least _some_ examples of<br/>this special sound. I do not hear this special sound at all in<br/>12-equal or anything closely approximating it, except for its bare<br/>octaves, fifths and fourths, but they are too boring for me to pay<br/>specially to hear.</p><p>Now if you tell me that something that is audibly completely<br/>indistinguishable from 12-equal can meaningfully be advertised as JI<br/>then what can I do? I can&apos;t afford the time to audition every such CD<br/>or concert before I pay my money.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about all the pieces by La Monte Young holding chords of high<br/>&gt; harmonics by machine. It is questionable that these could be tuned by<br/>&gt; ear, at least in a persons or instruments lifetime.<br/>&gt;  There are all these JI scales that you are generating by omitting<br/>&gt; commas ( a most untunable method in its very conception) are these<br/>not JI?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, 12-equal can be tuned by ear, by counting beats. Obviously that&apos;s<br/>not included as JI in my definition. Yes a JI microtemperament may<br/>need to be tuned by machine, but the point is that its intervals still<br/>sound much like they sound when tuned by ear.</p><p>Gene raise the same point. My definition of a just interval is one<br/>that _can_ be tuned by ear so as to sound nearly beatless, or at least<br/>to have &quot;that special sound&quot;, which may be difficult to capture in<br/>words but can easily be shown to anyone. If I set up one fixed note<br/>and sweep another one, I can say to anyone listening with me, you hear<br/>the special quality of this interval, and this one, and this one. If<br/>they have normal human hearing they wil say yes. And then I can say,<br/>now find me some others that have that same kind of quality, and they<br/>will do it. And then we will probably start to find some (near ratios<br/>of medium compelxity) where we are not quite sure, etc.</p><p>&gt; What if we limited Ets to the number that we can actually realize? Well<br/>&gt; all of Gene&apos;s work would be meaningless.</p><p>Yes. Let&apos;s do that. ;-) What should the limit be?

Please explain.<br/>For me JI produces definable intervals that lack the ambiguity that ETs do, where a single ET interval will functions as two different ratios. it use for me is to clearly define a structure.<br/>Basically my problems and concern are the exact opposite of what most of those investigating ETs are looking for.<br/>Where you can tune out comma, i want to have as many as possible. While you might want to tune out tones that are 4.5 Cents away in the eikosany, i am concern with keeping these differances as they are structurally and musically meaningful.<br/>&gt;&gt;  there is nothing in using ratios that requires the use or desire or  &gt;&gt; no beats, at least for the last  hundred years<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>And if a JI scale has more than about 6 notes then it can&apos;t help but<br/>contain many non-just intervals. You could still call these &quot;JI scale<br/>intervals&quot;, but that doesn&apos;t make them Just intervals.</p><p>I have found what you call non just intervals , some of my favotite.<br/>Many times i prefer a 40/27 to any of the alternatives, in fact it defines where i am in my scale, just like a tritone does in a major scale.<br/>Get rid of the tritopne and you do not know where you are. And a just interval doesn&apos;t have to be beatless, it only has to be<br/>close enough to a simple enough ratio that at least with _some_<br/>harmonic timbre, in _some_ chordal context, you can hear that the<br/>beating of _some_ harmonics is slow enough so as to give rise to that<br/>distinctive Just sound.</p><p>I don&apos;t know when a significant number of people started saying that<br/>the justness of an interval wasn&apos;t any quality you can hear, but<br/>instead a purely mathematical property. Maybe it was a hundred years<br/>ago, but maybe it only started around when the first digital<br/>synthesizers became available. In any case, there was an awful lot of<br/>time before a hundred years ago, when the justness of an interval<br/>meant something you could actually _hear_. I see no reason to give<br/>that up.</p><p>&gt;&gt;     And one again why should we not apply the same standard to ET, that &gt;&gt; is is only tunable by Machine.<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>Because<br/>(a) ET usn&apos;t the opposite of JI, non-JI is. Some JI scales are subsets<br/>of large ETs. Some ETs are JI.<br/>yes at the infinty of the continuum but that tells us nothing about what they are. then the terms have no meaning at all and we might as well close up the tuning list.<br/>i do not agree in any way.</p><p>I personally do not see 19 ET as a JI scale, first of all because you are defining it as 19ET.<br/>there is a question of gestalt in all this. The mind defines things in the simlppliest way.<br/>i could define JI using every word in the dictionary to show it&apos;s interelationship with many things, but such a definition is meaningless.<br/>At a certain point a chain of 19 just thirds will not be the same as 19ET.<br/>That you say it is  the same is only dbecause we lack enough tuning information. add one more third and see what happens. That you can makes it JI that you can&apos;t makes it 19ET.<br/>This shows that the two exist in two completely different structural worlds, one is open , the other is closed beyond a certain limit.<br/> I say again, &quot;tunable by ear&quot; is not my sole criterion for justness.<br/>It was just a snappy phrase to contrast against &quot;tuned to ratios&quot;.</p><p>Nothing is gained by dropping the tuned by ratios , yet everything is forever closed to progress further if you move away from it.  One property that i can say about JI scales that has not been mentioned. It produces scales of unequal sized intervals, if it involves more than one ratio.With all the composers mentioned, this is true. therefore it might be more inclusive. Another property of JI scale can be added on to using the same material already used to construct it to infinity. that at certain points of a JI structure, it will resemble ET structures at the perceptable level.<br/>There is a latter problem with the idea of perception though.<br/>While one may not notice a perceptable differance immediately, With myself, the problems with 31 ET took quite a while of using it for me to run into a problem.<br/>Personally it is a mistake i don&apos;t wish to duplicate.<br/>Hopefully this might explain why i will resist.  ________________________________________________________________________<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2005 12:22:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Message: 16           Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2005 02:09:11 -0000<br/>  From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: Definitions of JI</p><p>I&apos;ve described just chords as having a granite-slab quality, of<br/>steadiness and a kind of purity.

Now the very last thing one wants in such a situation is to increase the puns in such a structure as once you start using them in this context, you destroy what you are attempting to do &gt;&gt; I have found what you call non just intervals , some of my favotite.<br/>&gt;&gt;  Many times i prefer a 40/27 to any of the alternatives, in fact it<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>defines where i am in my scale, just like a tritone does in a major scale.</p><p>Well, that tells me you might object to meantone, which merges 40/27<br/>with 3/2. As i mentioned i don&apos;t like meantone because i can&apos;t stand the second or at least the mean tonne second</p><p>But in a schismatic tuning, there is little difference; and<br/>in one schismatic tuning, 1/12 schisma schismatic, there is no<br/>difference at all in the sense that 81/80 has the same size. If all<br/>you need is the structural presense of this tone, you can have it, and<br/>still be without the structural presence of other tones you may not<br/>really need.  I am aware that you  have many examples of ETS that have the 811/80.<br/>It seems expedient that if this is what i want, i might as well just use it in this form. &gt;&gt;  This shows that the two exist in two completely different<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>structural worlds, one is open , the other is closed beyond a certain<br/>limit.</p><p>That is, once again, purely mathematical. Dave is not trying to define<br/>something in mathematical terms. The abstract concepts are important<br/>and I&apos;m all for them, but there is another question one can ask, which<br/>is what is it that we can hear?</p><p>As Dan Wolf points out, we do not know. and also on what a time scale we are talking about.<br/>There arequestion of memory feedback, where what one hears is contintioned by what one has heard before. &gt;&gt; Nothing is gained by dropping the tuned by ratios , yet everything<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>is forever closed to progress further if you move away from it. This seems amazingly dogmatic. How does this answer Dave&apos;s point that<br/>you can, after all, tune equal temperament by ratios?</p><p>oh but has any one done it? there are as i mentioned JI scales that one cannot tune by ear.<br/>to tune 19ET by ear, one must suppress the over all tuning to do so, one can only listen to the last in the chain to hear it as the others will through you off.  &gt;&gt;  One property that i can say about JI scales that has not been<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>mentioned. It produces scales of unequal sized intervals, if it<br/>involves more than one ratio.With all the composers mentioned, this is<br/>true. therefore it might be more inclusive. This comes down to number theory, and once again is a mathematical<br/>property following from a mathematical definition. However, it is also<br/>true of, for instance, 1/4 comma meantone.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Another property of JI scale can be added on to using the same<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>material already used to construct it to infinity. Ditto the above.<br/>how is that if you have a closed chain?</p><p>&gt;&gt;  While one may not notice a perceptable differance immediately, With<br/>&gt;  &gt;<br/>myself, the problems with 31 ET took quite a while of using it for me<br/>to run into a problem.</p><p>But this really goes to Dave&apos;s point--he is not claiming 31 is JI. It<br/>clearly is tempering in any sense of the word. Soon or later, what another temperment does will show it colors. &gt;<br/>&gt;_------------ &gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2005 7:54:10 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Message: 8            Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2005 08:37:25 -0000<br/>  From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gwsmith@svpal.org">gwsmith@svpal.org</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: Definitions of JI</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; I will say that i like chords that beat more than dead<br/>&gt;&gt; still sonorities that just sit there.<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>Hey!

If i want say scales with unequal amount<br/>of steps, for instance  , why would one use Ets.</p><p>By far the most famous scale with unequal steps is not JI at all, but<br/>is the diatonic major scale. People use ets for that because it is<br/>convenient.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; it use for me is to clearly define a structure.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly. It defines a structure, which is to say, the definition is<br/>&gt; mathematical. We are always talking about temperaments of various<br/>&gt; ranks, meaning the various numbers of generators, and that does the<br/>&gt; same thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The type of structures generated in JI are different than those<br/>generated by ETs, except if we take it to infinity, but that is unusable.</p><p>In fact they are two examples of the exact same kind of thing, which<br/>mathematically are called &quot;free abelian groups&quot;. This means that<br/>there are a certain number of generators, and everything else is a sum<br/>of those generators. For 5-limit JI, the generators would be<br/>1200 cents (2), 1901.955 cents (3) and 2786.314 cents. For 12-et, you<br/>get only a single generator of 100 cents. The first is called rank 3,<br/>because it has three independent generators, and the second rank 1. In<br/>between is rank 2; for example 1200 cents and 1896.578 cents, which is<br/>1/4 comma meantone.</p><p>The latter has, in fact, exactly the same structure as Pythagorean<br/>tuning, but simply tunes the 3 differently. This sort of thing is<br/>quite common. Marvel temperament, the 225/224 planar temperament, has<br/>exactly the same structure as 5-limit JI, but has its tuning adjusted<br/>so that 225/32 serves for a 7. Hence a certain quadrilateral in the<br/>lattice of 5-limit note-classes suddenly becomes an important<br/>additional structural feature, but not in a way which makes any of the<br/>5-limit structure change in any way. It is all still there. If now you<br/>make an additional comma out of 1029/1024, the 5-limit plane wraps<br/>itself into a cylinder, so you do have a different structure, but a<br/>related one. This is miracle.</p><p>&gt; The question is that the two approaches produce different results,<br/>although as you point out one can be used to appoximate the other. In<br/>reality it fosters different types of music , which is artistically useful</p><p>It&apos;s true that adding commas, nanotempering commas, can foster one<br/>clear difference--the comma pump. JI harmony tends to always relate<br/>itself to the 1/1; commas lead to comma pumps, which allow for a kind<br/>of harmonic restlessness which you&apos;d probably have to allow<br/>micromodulations by very small intervals to get from JI. I&apos;ve tested<br/>it, and to my ears there isn&apos;t much to choose between a sequence of<br/>chords which modulates by 2401/2400 in JI, and one which returns to<br/>its starting point in breed temperament or ennealimmal. Someone with a<br/>very refined absolute pitch sense might react differently, I suppose,<br/>and it would be interesting to test that.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; Another property of JI scale can be added on to using the same<br/>&gt; material already used to construct it to infinity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ditto the above.<br/>&gt;  how is that if you have a closed chain?</p><p>Not every temperament is an equal (rank 1) temperament. Any<br/>temperament with rank above one will have this property; that would<br/>mean &quot;logical&quot; meantone, or meantone tuned to 1/4 comma, for instance.</p><p>&gt; But this really goes to Dave&apos;s point--he is not claiming 31 is JI. It<br/>&gt; clearly is tempering in any sense of the word.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Soon or later, what another temperment does will show it colors.</p><p>I don&apos;t think if you used 2460 it would ever show its colors. I don&apos;t<br/>think for your work it would ever make any difference. Even if I am<br/>wrong, there is going to be a point where it becomes true.

This is true, and at the<br/>7-limit, I personally consider even 72-ET to be a microtemperament<br/>(perceptibly-JI).  but I assumed you were tanking of scales with far<br/>fewer notes.</p><p>If a 5-limit western diatonic is all you need, and maximum perceptible<br/>justness is your aim, then you either live with the D:A wolf or you<br/>use an optimal meantone (possibly with tempered octaves). There are no<br/>other options. You have to hide a 21.5 cent comma, and this comma can<br/>only be distributed in certain ways such that you&apos;re bound to have an<br/>error of at least a quarter of this comma in some consonant interval. See<br/><a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/music/DistributingCommas.htm">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/music/DistributingCommas.htm</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Whereas MJ intonation (MJI) uses no tempering whatsoever; cannot<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; avoid the wolves; can supply exact thirds and sixths; and<br/>produces the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; least regular scales possible.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh no. That&apos;s quite wrong. You can do absolutely anything you like in<br/>&gt; &gt; mathematical JI, since the only requirement is that the result is<br/>&gt; &gt; expressed using (frequency or wavelength) ratios, never cents or other<br/>&gt; &gt; logarithmic units.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I almost believe you&apos;re right ...  In an earlier message, I produced a<br/>&gt; scale with an imperfect fifth of 299/200 as generator, replacing 3/2<br/>&gt; in a cycle of fifths stopping after seven notes: as regular as can be,<br/>&gt; with all whole-tones equal in size, and both semitones equal in size.<br/>&gt; Now that&apos;s MJI, but clearly not PJI, since every fifth is almost 6<br/>&gt; cents flat.  And it&apos;s not MSIJI, so I&apos;d be unlikely to use it.</p><p>Correct. As Gene said, it&apos;s an excellent meantone and this is a prime<br/>example of tempering by ratios. Have you listened to it.</p><p>A problem some folks have with meantone is that the major ninths are<br/>way too far from 4:9 for any semblance of justness. This can be<br/>improved slightly by widening the octaves by up to a sixth of a comma,<br/>but the fourths and major sixths suffer.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You can even do _tempering_ in mathematical JI, but<br/>&gt; &gt; you&apos;d better not call it that. :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can???</p><p>Sure. You just did it above with your 200:299 fifths.</p><p>&gt; Suppose you want to temper out a comma, say<br/>&gt; 2401/2400.  Do you simply adjust the ratio of the next nearest<br/>&gt; interval by that ratio?</p><p>See my paper above, but instead of dividing your comma into<br/>logarithmically equal parts by first converting to cents, calculate<br/>rational pseudo-roots (I don&apos;t know what they are really called).</p><p>Lets say you want the Syntonic/Didymus comma (81/80) in four<br/>nearly-equal parts, i.e. find pseudo fourth roots for it.

I doubt I could enjoy Chopin&apos;s piano<br/>music played on anything BUT a 12-EDO piano (haen&apos;t tried<br/>it yet, tho).</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; But then they have the problem that very few real-world<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; instruments can guarantee _exact_ ratios, so then it comes down to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; something like the _intention_ to tune to exact ratios.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; They made it quite clear that you could have something that was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; audibly (or even measurably) indistinguishable from 12-equal, and they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would still call it JI, provided it was intended to be tuned to exact<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ratios (no matter how large the numbers in the ratios).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I followed that conversation, and suspect that they were<br/>&gt; &gt; set up, and sandbagged ... ! :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure what &quot;sandbagged&quot; means in this context, but I sure<br/>&gt; _thought_ I was setting them up. However, when I came to the point<br/>&gt; where Kraig (or any other mathematical-JI-er following the<br/>&gt; conversation -- presumably including Daniel Wolf -- should have said,<br/>&gt; er now wait a minute, I wouldn&apos;t call something indistinguishable from<br/>&gt; 12-ET, &quot;JI&quot; --  or worse, that scale I made with the least<br/>&gt; perceptibly-just intervals I could come up with -- they didn&apos;t bat an<br/>&gt; eyelid.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kraig specifically said that he didn&apos;t need to listen to it. It was<br/>&gt; expressed in ratios so it was JI.</p><p>Yes, I thought that strange.</p><p>&gt; &gt; God may know the intentions of your heart, but of what<br/>&gt; &gt; possible use is that to hearers of your music?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, my point exactly.</p><p>We seem to agree on this.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Compared to this, &quot;perceptible JI&quot; is a bit more complex and subtle,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isn&apos;t it?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That depends on whether you are considering the actual psycho-physical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; musical event, or the mathematical modelling of it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mathematical JI is of course extremely simple to model mathematically.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As is &quot;mathematical small-integer JI&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. And indeed this is the obvious point of departure in the<br/>&gt; mathematical modelling of perceptible JI. The first thing to add to<br/>&gt; this is _tolerance_. Most of us on this list can agree that departing<br/>&gt; from the intended ratio by 1/3 of a cent does not change the<br/>&gt; perceptible quality of a harmony, for most musical purposes.</p><p>Right.</p><p>&gt; Of course one can always sustain an electronically-generated chord<br/>&gt; long enough that you can hear beats that take even several minutes to<br/>&gt; cycle. But this isn&apos;t typical of music, and most instruments aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; that accurate. We can make exceptions for things like La Monte Young&apos;s<br/>&gt; Dream House. Its perceptible justness apparently _does_ require<br/>&gt; extremely accurate tuning because it uses ratios of such large numbers.</p><p>Agreed, it would materially alter the sound of the piece to be even<br/>fractionally mistuned.  Very little music uses interacting pure sine<br/>waves, either; the closer it gets to that (as with soprano voices, simple<br/>flutes or thin plucked strings), the less tolerance most of us have for<br/>mistuning.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; But as a psycho-physical event it is so complex and subtle as to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; completely non-existent. :-) i.e. As Kraig said, there&apos;s no way to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tell by listening whether or not something is (mathematical) JI.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Apparently one must simply take the composer&apos;s word for it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is not true of &quot;mathematical small-integer JI&quot;, is it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. Because it is also a subset of perceptible JI.</p><p>I thnk the appropriate model may be that PJI and<br/>MJI _intersect_ in small-integer just intonation (SIJI).<br/>That is, that SIJI, and only SIJI, is both percebtibly and<br/>mathematically just.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &quot;Rich&quot; was the term used in my schools, both for saturated<br/>&gt; &gt; colours and saturated harmonies.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; My definition is currently injuctive.<br/>&gt; &gt; Injunctive?  As in, giving an injunction or instruction?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you&apos;d never experience a sponge cake (or a sponge anything) and I<br/>&gt; wanted to define &quot;sponge-cake&quot; for you, the simplest thing might be<br/>&gt; for me to give you a recipe.</p><p>And this approach has now-venerable antecedents in mathematics,<br/>too.  Call me old-fashioned if you will, but I prefer analytic ideas<br/>when possible.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m currently reading Oliver Sacks&apos; &quot;The Island of the Colour Blind&quot;.<br/>&gt; He describes a friend who drove with his 3-year old son into the<br/>&gt; countryside for the first time and his son said, &quot;Hey dad, look at the<br/>&gt; orange grass&quot;. His dad said. &quot;No son, orange is the colour of an<br/>&gt; orange.&quot; His son said &quot;Yes, its the colour of an orange&quot;. That was the<br/>&gt; first he realised his son was red-green colour-blind.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We have to be just as prepared that some people may be able to<br/>&gt; perceive justness that we can&apos;t or vice versa, but this is something<br/>&gt; that can be tested objectively.</p><p>Indeed!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Even so, fraught with potential pitfalls.  That you have even<br/>&gt; &gt; allowed for things L, M and N means you have a grey area<br/>&gt; &gt; where different people will perceive different things; in short,<br/>&gt; &gt; where you cannot confidently assert that justness is perceptible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure. But I can live with that. We do it with colour. And there&apos;s an<br/>&gt; awful lot that we will agree on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The best you could hope for is some kind of statistical norm.<br/>&gt; &gt; This, too, has difficulties.  The brains of musicians have been<br/>&gt; &gt; demonstrated to grow in those areas responsible for pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; discrimination.  Yes, we really do &quot;grow a brain&quot;!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That doesn&apos;t sound unlikely to me at all. However there is a big<br/>&gt; difference between someone claiming they can tune 13:17 by ear and<br/>&gt; claiming they can tune 131:171.</p><p>Again, such claims can be tested objectively.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; How would you define Redishness?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;An object exhibits reddishness if it emits or reflects any<br/>&gt; &gt; light of wavelengths in that region of the EM spectrum where<br/>&gt; &gt; the Red colour receptors are most responsive.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A lot of people consider spectral violet to be reddish.</p><p>I was wondering if you&apos;d mention that! :-)</p><p>Most normally-sighted people do.  And that&apos;s because<br/>the Red colour receptors are also responsive there,<br/>but to a smaller degree than in the &quot;red&quot; wavelengths<br/>at the other end of the visible spectrum.  If you delete<br/>the word &quot;most&quot; from my attempted definition, that<br/>should suffice.  I think that improves it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve worked with colour for a long time, as a visual artist.<br/>&gt; &gt; I do take your point - perception is subtle, conditioned on<br/>&gt; &gt; all manner of interfering circumstances, on culture and on<br/>&gt; &gt; training.  But it wasn&apos;t I who was trying to argue for the<br/>&gt; &gt; existence of &quot;perceptible JI&quot;; so it&apos;s not up to me to either<br/>&gt; &gt; define it or demonstrate it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right. But my point was, that we live with this ambiguity in the case<br/>&gt; of colour, we don&apos;t try to force it into an oversimplified<br/>&gt; mathematical model.</p><p>Sure we do!  And to good purpose, too.  Most list members<br/>are reading these messages on a computer monitor that<br/>reconstitutes many colours in the eye using just three &quot;primary&quot;<br/>colour guns - Red, Green and Blue.  No way you can see a<br/>pure yellow light or a pure violet light emanate from your<br/>screen.  Yet the simulation is, for most practical purposes,<br/>good enough.</p><p>Not only are simplified models (mathematical or otherwise)<br/>useful, they also test and expand our understanding, by the<br/>very ways they fail in particular cases.  That is, they are a<br/>tool of the scientific method, with its cycle of observation,<br/>hypothesising and testing.</p><p>We all use simplified models all the time.  They enable us to<br/>cross the street safely, on our walk to the corner store to<br/>pick up a newspaper which we confidently expect to find<br/>there, in the same place as yesterday&apos;s.</p><p>Whether our models are _over_-simplified is entirely a<br/>question of our purposes when we apply them.  If they<br/>fail to help us achieve those purposes, they are inadequate<br/>and need revision.  Their inadequacy is sometimes, but not<br/>always, due to being overly simple.  Sometimes we have to<br/>refine and complicate our models; at others, we need to<br/>change or challenge our basic assumptions.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Any tempering scheme that is gentle enough to leave a tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; perceptibly just is unlikely to be able to eliminate all wolves.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Aha!  As I suspected!  The wolf sneaks in the back door ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s wrong with a few wolves anyway?</p><p>Try holding one in two- or three-part vocal harmony for<br/>two seconds!

The last word I&apos;d apply<br/>to this kind of music is &quot;harmony&quot;!  :-(  And wolves are<br/>even more discordant.</p><p>&gt; Gene mentioned nano-temperaments that are also equal temperaments,<br/>&gt; such as 171-ET as an example with no wolves. This is true, and at the<br/>&gt; 7-limit, I personally consider even 72-ET to be a microtemperament<br/>&gt; (perceptibly-JI).  but I assumed you were tanking of scales with far<br/>&gt; fewer notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If a 5-limit western diatonic is all you need, and maximum perceptible<br/>&gt; justness is your aim, then you either live with the D:A wolf or you<br/>&gt; use an optimal meantone (possibly with tempered octaves). There are no<br/>&gt; other options. You have to hide a 21.5 cent comma, and this comma can<br/>&gt; only be distributed in certain ways such that you&apos;re bound to have an<br/>&gt; error of at least a quarter of this comma in some consonant interval. See<br/>&gt; <a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/music/DistributingCommas.htm">http://users.bigpond.net.au/d.keenan/music/DistributingCommas.htm</a></p><p>Thanks; been there!</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whereas MJ intonation (MJI) uses no tempering whatsoever; cannot<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; avoid the wolves; can supply exact thirds and sixths; and<br/>&gt; produces the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least regular scales possible.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh no. That&apos;s quite wrong. You can do absolutely anything you like in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematical JI, since the only requirement is that the result is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; expressed using (frequency or wavelength) ratios, never cents or other<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; logarithmic units.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I almost believe you&apos;re right ...  In an earlier message, I produced a<br/>&gt; &gt; scale with an imperfect fifth of 299/200 as generator, replacing 3/2<br/>&gt; &gt; in a cycle of fifths stopping after seven notes: as regular as can be,<br/>&gt; &gt; with all whole-tones equal in size, and both semitones equal in size.<br/>&gt; &gt; Now that&apos;s MJI, but clearly not PJI, since every fifth is almost 6<br/>&gt; &gt; cents flat.  And it&apos;s not MSIJI, so I&apos;d be unlikely to use it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Correct. As Gene said, it&apos;s an excellent meantone and this is a prime<br/>&gt; example of tempering by ratios. Have you listened to it.</p><p>No; why should I want to?</p><p>&gt; A problem some folks have with meantone is that the major ninths are<br/>&gt; way too far from 4:9 for any semblance of justness. This can be<br/>&gt; improved slightly by widening the octaves by up to a sixth of a comma,<br/>&gt; but the fourths and major sixths suffer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You can even do _tempering_ in mathematical JI, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you&apos;d better not call it that. :-)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You can???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure. You just did it above with your 200:299 fifths.</p><p>OK ...</p><p>&gt; &gt; Suppose you want to temper out a comma, say<br/>&gt; &gt; 2401/2400.  Do you simply adjust the ratio of the next nearest<br/>&gt; &gt; interval by that ratio?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See my paper above, but instead of dividing your comma into<br/>&gt; logarithmically equal parts by first converting to cents, calculate<br/>&gt; rational pseudo-roots (I don&apos;t know what they are really called).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Lets say you want the Syntonic/Didymus comma (81/80) in four<br/>&gt; nearly-equal parts, i.e. find pseudo fourth roots for it. Multiply<br/>&gt; both sides by 4 to get 324/320 then you can write it as<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 324   323   322   321<br/>&gt; --- * --- * --- * ---<br/>&gt; 323   322   321   300<br/>&gt;<br/>That&apos;s 320, not 300, of course.</p><p>In this case they are sequential epimoric or superparticular<br/>ratios.  In the case you give below, the sequence is formed<br/>similarly, with a fixed surplus of numerator over denominator,<br/>but this is no longer equal to 1.

And indeed this is the obvious point of departure in the<br/>&gt; &gt; mathematical modelling of perceptible JI. The first thing to add to<br/>&gt; &gt; this is _tolerance_. Most of us on this list can agree that departing<br/>&gt; &gt; from the intended ratio by 1/3 of a cent does not change the<br/>&gt; &gt; perceptible quality of a harmony, for most musical purposes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Of course one can always sustain an electronically-generated chord<br/>&gt; &gt; long enough that you can hear beats that take even several minutes to<br/>&gt; &gt; cycle. But this isn&apos;t typical of music, and most instruments aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; that accurate. We can make exceptions for things like La Monte Young&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; Dream House. Its perceptible justness apparently _does_ require<br/>&gt; &gt; extremely accurate tuning because it uses ratios of such large<br/>numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Agreed, it would materially alter the sound of the piece to be even<br/>&gt; fractionally mistuned.  Very little music uses interacting pure sine<br/>&gt; waves, either; the closer it gets to that (as with soprano voices,<br/>simple<br/>&gt; flutes or thin plucked strings), the less tolerance most of us have for<br/>&gt; mistuning.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure about the sine-wave thing. It depends how loud they are.</p><p>I find I can tolerate less mistuning with quiet sawtooths than with<br/>quiet sines. With loud enough sines, harmonics are generated by<br/>nonlinearities in the ear (not to mention the amps and speakers).</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Apparently one must simply take the composer&apos;s word for it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is not true of &quot;mathematical small-integer JI&quot;, is it?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No. Because it is also a subset of perceptible JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I thnk the appropriate model may be that PJI and<br/>&gt; MJI _intersect_ in small-integer just intonation (SIJI).<br/>&gt; That is, that SIJI, and only SIJI, is both percebtibly and<br/>&gt; mathematically just.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Of course there is no sharp cutoff for justness in smallness of<br/>integers. The best simply-expressed cutoffs for dyads seem to be in<br/>terms of the &quot;product complexity&quot; i.e. the product of both sides of<br/>the ratio when expressed in lowest terms, however there seems to be a<br/>special case needed for ratios where the smaller number is a power of<br/>2 (i.e. low note octave-equivalent to the virtual fundamental). Like<br/>maybe throw out a factor of two in that case.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If you&apos;d never experience a sponge cake (or a sponge anything) and I<br/>&gt; &gt; wanted to define &quot;sponge-cake&quot; for you, the simplest thing might be<br/>&gt; &gt; for me to give you a recipe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And this approach has now-venerable antecedents in mathematics,<br/>&gt; too.

And to good purpose, too.

Yet the simulation is, for most practical purposes,<br/>&gt; good enough.</p><p>In that case, it isn&apos;t _over_simplified.</p><p>Oversimplified is saying &quot;Justly intoned means tuned to ratios of<br/>small integers&quot; when that covers hardly anything we actually hear that<br/>we call Just (in fact nothing prior to electronics).

If they<br/>&gt; fail to help us achieve those purposes, they are inadequate<br/>&gt; and need revision.  Their inadequacy is sometimes, but not<br/>&gt; always, due to being overly simple.  Sometimes we have to<br/>&gt; refine and complicate our models; at others, we need to<br/>&gt; change or challenge our basic assumptions.</p><p>Indeed. And if your purpose is to predict when intervals in a scale<br/>you&apos;ve constructed will _sound_ just, then &quot;if they&apos;re ratios they&apos;re<br/>just&quot; is utterly useless, and &quot;if they&apos;re small integer ratios they&apos;re<br/>just&quot; is useless for anything you&apos;re going to implement with voice or<br/>acoustic instruments (and most electronic ones).</p><p>&gt; &gt; What&apos;s wrong with a few wolves anyway?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Try holding one in two- or three-part vocal harmony for<br/>&gt; two seconds!

If they<br/>&gt; &gt; fail to help us achieve those purposes, they are inadequate<br/>&gt; &gt; and need revision.  Their inadequacy is sometimes, but not<br/>&gt; &gt; always, due to being overly simple.  Sometimes we have to<br/>&gt; &gt; refine and complicate our models; at others, we need to<br/>&gt; &gt; change or challenge our basic assumptions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed. And if your purpose is to predict when intervals in a scale<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve constructed will _sound_ just, then &quot;if they&apos;re ratios they&apos;re<br/>&gt; just&quot; is utterly useless,</p><p>I can see that.

Still I<br/>find it odd that your tolerance or accuracy wouldn&apos;t be finer with<br/>other waveforms. Almost everyone I&apos;ve discussed this stuff with, for<br/>example Daniel Wolf, finds it a lot harder to pin down the tuning<br/>when sine waves are used as opposed to any other (periodic) waveform.</p><p>The accepted explanation is: sine waves have no harmonics; tuning<br/>simple-integer ratios is done by (and is always the result when)<br/>eliminating beating between coincident harmonics; hence there&apos;s<br/>little chance of accurately tuning simple-integer ratios (except 1:1)<br/>when using sine waves. This jibes very well with my experience but I<br/>can&apos;t categorically deny that you&apos;re experiencing something else.<br/>Nonetheless, this &apos;experiment&apos; or &apos;observation&apos; is a fundamental<br/>assumption behind Sethares&apos; entire book, since he assumes that simply<br/>replacing harmonic partials with inharmonic partials in the timbres<br/>used will completely replace any &apos;attraction to&apos; or &apos;consonance of&apos;<br/>simple-integer ratios with an &apos;attraction to&apos; or &apos;consonance of&apos; the<br/>relevant inharmonic ratios. I&apos;ve tried to point out some limitations<br/>to this way of thinking; perhaps your experience will point to others.</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2005 12:59:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; I think in the case of 2401/2400, where you get chords off by less<br/>&gt; &gt; than a cent, it really is a sort of tempering.

Still I<br/>find it odd that your tolerance or accuracy wouldn&apos;t be finer with<br/>other waveforms. Almost everyone I&apos;ve discussed this stuff with, for<br/>example Daniel Wolf, finds it a lot harder to pin down the tuning<br/>when sine waves are used as opposed to any other (periodic) waveform.</p><p>The accepted explanation is: sine waves have no harmonics; tuning<br/>simple-integer ratios is done by (and is always the result when)<br/>eliminating beating between coincident harmonics; hence there&apos;s<br/>little chance of accurately tuning simple-integer ratios (except 1:1)<br/>when using sine waves. This jibes very well with my experience but I<br/>can&apos;t categorically deny that you&apos;re experiencing something else.<br/>Nonetheless, this &apos;experiment&apos; or &apos;observation&apos; is a fundamental<br/>assumption behind Sethares&apos; entire book, since he assumes that simply<br/>replacing harmonic partials with inharmonic partials in the timbres<br/>used will completely replace any &apos;attraction to&apos; or &apos;consonance of&apos;<br/>simple-integer ratios with an &apos;attraction to&apos; or &apos;consonance of&apos; the<br/>relevant inharmonic ratios.

This jibes very well with my experience<br/>&gt; but I can&apos;t categorically deny that you&apos;re experiencing something<br/>&gt; else.</p><p>Because most pitched musical instruments do produce overtones<br/>of the fundamental frequency, I believe, we automatically compare<br/>the sum tone of two pure sine sources with the expected overtones,<br/>and thus can tune two pure sine sources using their combination tones.<br/>According to this theory, we should be able to readily tune 1:2, 2:3,<br/>3:4 and maybe 4:5 ratios of sine tones.  The theory suggests we can<br/>tune whatever intervals have combination tones near those<br/>frequencies we would expect to find as sufficiently strong overtones.<br/>I note that the same theory applies equally to tuning 1:1, since the<br/>sum tone is then an octave, one of the commonest (tho not always<br/>strongest) overtones in &apos;natural&apos; instruments.</p><p>Including the sum and difference tones for 1:2, 2:3, 3:4 and 4:5<br/>ratios gives timbres that include 1:1:2:3, 1:2:3:5, 1:3:4:7 and 1:4:5:9<br/>ratios.  If we take 110Hz as the fundamental, or 1, the corresponding<br/>9 is only 990Hz, so all these tones and combinations lie well within a<br/>normal hearing range, easy to test for.</p><p>Another possible mechanism for tuning performance is kinaesthetic:<br/>it involves subvocalisation.  In short, it posits that we may tune<br/>intervals by (almost) singing their component notes.  Muscle memory<br/>helps us to find the perfect fifth, or just major third, above the first<br/>tone.  On this theory, we should get better at tuning the more we sing,<br/>and possibly also the more recently we have sung.  This theory requires<br/>no awareness of the overtone structure of common timbres, but of<br/>course people who sing a lot are aware of the timbre of their own<br/>voices, so perhaps singers could use both mechanisms.</p><p>So now I want to design experiments to distinguish what effect, if<br/>any, these possible mechanisms have on tuning performance.</p><p>&gt; ... Nonetheless, this &apos;experiment&apos; or &apos;observation&apos; is a<br/>&gt; fundamental assumption behind Sethares&apos; entire book, since he<br/>&gt; assumes that simply replacing harmonic partials with inharmonic<br/>&gt; partials in the timbres used will completely replace any &apos;attraction<br/>&gt; to&apos; or &apos;consonance of&apos; simple-integer ratios with an &apos;attraction to&apos;<br/>&gt; or &apos;consonance of&apos; the relevant inharmonic ratios. I&apos;ve tried to<br/>&gt; point out some limitations to this way of thinking; perhaps your<br/>&gt; experience will point to others.</p><p>If I&apos;m right, and we automatically interpret &apos;musical&apos; sounds<br/>according to our stored experiences of music, we&apos;ll find<br/>consonances where we expect to - and dissonances, too.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>No virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.338 / Virus Database: 267.9.7/60 - Release Date: 28/7/05</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/1/2005 12:48:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s quite easy to produce sine waves, I believe, using elementary<br/>&gt; electronics;</p><p>From what I&apos;ve read and seen it&apos;s far easier to produce sawtooth,<br/>triangle, and pulse waves than accurate sine waves.</p><p>&gt; as to their purity, I have no easy way to gauge.<br/>&gt; Perhaps I could measure the THD in the recorded waves, using<br/>&gt; some audio software?  Of course, what the electronics produces<br/>&gt; then has to pass through amplification and loudspeakers, which<br/>&gt; may introduce significant distortion.</p><p>Exactly. You&apos;d have to take *all* the distortion into account. Even<br/>combinational tones are a kind of distortion (occuring primarily in<br/>the ear and less in the brain), and although I allow them below, I&apos;m<br/>pretty sure the Plomp &amp; Levelt experiments were deliberately done at<br/>low volume levels so that the combinational tones would be relatively<br/>inaudible. (Most combinational tones have a loudness which increases<br/>as the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th power of the loudness of the &apos;real&apos;<br/>tones.)</p><p>&gt; &gt; The accepted explanation is: sine waves have no harmonics; tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; simple-integer ratios is done by (and is always the result when)<br/>&gt; &gt; eliminating beating between coincident harmonics; hence there&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; little chance of accurately tuning simple-integer ratios (except<br/>&gt; &gt; 1:1) when using sine waves. This jibes very well with my<br/>experience<br/>&gt; &gt; but I can&apos;t categorically deny that you&apos;re experiencing something<br/>&gt; &gt; else.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because most pitched musical instruments do produce overtones<br/>&gt; of the fundamental frequency, I believe, we automatically compare<br/>&gt; the sum tone of two pure sine sources with the expected overtones,<br/>&gt; and thus can tune two pure sine sources using their combination<br/>tones.</p><p>Sum tones are very elusive compared to several of the different-order<br/>difference tones that are produced. But even granting your sum tones,<br/>there&apos;s no beating with &quot;expected&quot; overtones. Only real overtones can<br/>beat. Without the beating, I don&apos;t see how you propose to acheive<br/>great accuracy in the tuning. You may be able to tune with accuracy<br/>on the order of the *melodic* just noticeable difference (since<br/>you&apos;re relying on your memory of intervals or pitches just as you<br/>would when listening to a melody) but probably not on the order of<br/>the *harmonic* just noticeable difference, which relies on active<br/>perception of the interaction between actually sounding tones.</p><p>I believe a far more likely explanation for any success in tuning<br/>sine waves to small-integer ratios involves aligning the virtual<br/>pitches with the combinational tones (difference tones). I&apos;m pretty<br/>sure I&apos;ve discussed virtual pitches with you before, either here or<br/>on the harmonic entropy list. Basically, the brain &apos;creates&apos; a<br/>fundamental, even if the fundamental is physically absent, when it<br/>encounters a set of pure tones suggestive of a harmonic series.<br/>Whenever you hear a male voice on the telephone, this virtual pitch<br/>phenomenon is a large part of your perception -- the pitches you<br/>think you&apos;re hearing are not even physically present. The virtual<br/>pitch is *not* any kind of difference tone, but it will be identical<br/>in pitch to one of the difference tones if the pure tones are in<br/>exact low-harmonic proportions.</p><p>&gt; &gt; ...
