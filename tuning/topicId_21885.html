I thought it might be fun<br/>to compare the historical temperament that Ed used (in this case, Prinz,<br/>aka Kirnberger III) to a temperament suggested by the intervals<br/>contained in the piece itself.</p><p>As before, my analysis presupposes that intervals (major and minor<br/>thirds, fourths, and fifths) should best be as close to Just as<br/>possible.  This supposition might be contrary to the original composer&apos;s<br/>practice, and certainly, wishes.</p><p>Kirnberger III tallied worse than 12-tET, and much worse than an unusual<br/>meantone range (Cb to E was the best 12-note set), which was very close<br/>to my COFT.</p><p>I found the ideal fixed tuning deviations in cents from 12-tET to be<br/>(note: 0 == C, 1 == C#/Db, etc.):</p><p>(meantone-like pitch degrees:)<br/>E6 7C 43  (For pitch  6, we have bend  12.4157)<br/>E1 66 43  (For pitch  1, we have bend  11.8702)<br/>E8 30 42  (For pitch  8, we have bend   7.4302)<br/>E3 23 41  (For pitch  3, we have bend   3.9831)<br/>EB 4E 40  (For pitch 10, we have bend   1.9264)<br/>E5 17 40  (For pitch  5, we have bend   0.5832)<br/>E0 08 3F  (For pitch  0, we have bend  -2.9398)<br/>E7 6D 3D  (For pitch  7, we have bend  -6.7235)<br/>E2 38 3C  (For pitch  2, we have bend -11.1407)<br/>EA 6D 3B  (For pitch  9, we have bend -12.9846)</p><p>(transitional pitch degrees:)<br/>E4 25 3D  (For pitch  4, we have bend  -8.4883)<br/>EC 26 41  (For pitch 11, we have bend   4.0680)</p><p>I found the major thirds to be distributed as follows (note the Strength<br/>column):</p><p>Ptch Tuning Ptch Tuning Strength    Ideal   Actual      Force       Pain<br/>---- ------ ---- ------ -------- -------- -------- ---------- ----------<br/> 0   -2.94   4   -8.49    86.131  386.561  394.452    679.639   2681.422<br/> 7   -6.72  11    4.07    73.253  387.363  410.791   1716.182  20103.580<br/> 2  -11.14   6   12.42     2.357  397.448  423.556     61.542    803.382<br/> 9  -12.98   1   11.87     2.726  394.278  424.855     83.352   1274.301<br/> 4   -8.49   8    7.43    10.898  390.764  415.918    274.141   3447.875<br/>11    4.07   3    3.98    85.794  386.848  399.915   1121.036   7324.096<br/> 6   12.42  10    1.93   235.739  386.381  389.511    737.801   1154.563<br/> 1   11.87   5    0.58   339.727  386.316  388.713    814.349    976.025<br/> 8    7.43   0   -2.94   385.967  386.427  389.630   1236.358   1980.199<br/> 3    3.98   7   -6.72   636.844  386.646  389.293   1686.194   2232.297<br/>10    1.93   2  -11.14   809.829  386.360  386.933    464.323    133.112<br/> 5    0.58   9  -12.98   506.189  386.434  386.432     -0.996      0.001</p><p>Not surprisingly, the major third most represented is Bb to D, the<br/>dominant and leading tone.</p><p>Here are overall numbers for several tunings:</p><p>   12-tET Total          spring pain:      729063.071<br/>   Werckmeister III      spring pain:      859050.789<br/>   Kirnberger III Total  spring pain:      888543.678<br/>   Thomas Young Total    spring pain:      774346.300<br/>   31 from Cb  to E  :   spring pain:      354791.067<br/>   31 from Gb  to B  :   spring pain:      427660.954<br/>   31 from Db  to F# :   spring pain:      827362.457<br/>   31 from Ab  to C# :   spring pain:     1447712.949<br/>   31 from Eb  to G# :   spring pain:     2217852.100<br/>   31 from Bb  to D# :   spring pain:     3174777.136<br/>   31 from F   to A# :   spring pain:     4042854.356<br/>   COFT Total            spring pain:      296211.282<br/>   After relaxing, Total spring pain:      156333.908<br/>      Final vertical     spring pain:       94400.682<br/>      Final horizontal   spring pain:       11702.854<br/>      Final grounding    spring pain:       50230.372<br/>   Bend range applied: -15.5901 to  15.1134</p><p>Note that meantone scale Gb to B is almost as good as Cb to E, but<br/>Db to F# is much worse, because the major third Gb-Bb is fairly well<br/>represented.  A more usual Eb to G# is terrible.</p><p>Kirnberger III&apos;s pain numbers are most heavily inflated by the major<br/>triad Ab-C-Eb (subdominant to the tonic key).  Of course, from one<br/>perspective this gives the piece more color.</p><p>Notes: in this analysis I used my older 5-limit tuning targets, in which<br/>dom 7th chords tend to have a 7th degree 8/9 of root above.  As<br/>expected, the newer alternative (so-called &quot;tuning file free&quot;), which<br/>targets 7th degree at 9/10 of root above, gives a somewhat more extreme<br/>range of tuning deviations from 12-tET.</p><p>This analysis is based upon the only MIDI sequence of the piece that I<br/>could find, performed by Bunji Hisamori.  It&apos;s fair to say that Bunji is<br/>no Enid Katahn, but I hope that the interval set is reasonably well<br/>represented.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
