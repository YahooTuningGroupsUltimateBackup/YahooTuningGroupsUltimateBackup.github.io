One reason I&apos;ve been asking<br/>&gt; about it is that I&apos;d like to create some midi examples of<br/>&gt; automorphism groups acting on music to illustrate some things I would<br/>&gt; like to discuss on the tuning-math group, and your hexany pieces<br/>&gt; would be ideal for some purposes. If you would be interested in what<br/>&gt; happens when the group of the octahedron is applied to it (24<br/>&gt; elements) or even the full orthogonal group (48 different versions of<br/>&gt; each of your hexany pieces) perhaps you could send something in an<br/>&gt; ascii version which would allow a perspicuous editing and alteration<br/>&gt; of the tuning.</p><p>Sounds fun.

(e.g. 2 &lt;-&gt; 3, 3 &lt;-&gt; 5)</p><p>However, I don&apos;t think that method gets the quarter turns about one line<br/>joining two opposite vertices.</p><p>So I suppose then to get those, one replaces 2 by 1/2, 3 by 1/3, 5 by 1/5<br/>and 7 by 1/7, so that 2 * 3 -&gt; 1/(2*3), then on multiplying all the ratios<br/>by 2*3*5*7 one gets 2*3 -&gt; 5*7, i.e. reflection in the equatorial square<br/>of the octahedron. That would complete the group.</p><p>FTS now has an option to log ratios played (thanks to suggestion by<br/>Mary Ackerley :-)). However that is meant for one to read, so that one can<br/>see which intervals were played. It doesn&apos;t log the times, or channels, or say<br/>which notes were switched on / off at any moment (e.g. two successive<br/>notes show up as the same as a single sustained note with change of<br/>accompaniment).</p><p>Do you have any suggestions for a suitable ascii format?</p><p>I can add a record to text as a third option (at present has<br/>record to WAVE, and to MIDI).

Plus there&apos;s the matter of keeping track of it all<br/>and not introducing errors, if doing it by hand like this.</p><p>Perhaps though, if I programmed it in, you could generate the midi<br/>files from the hexany original in automatic fashion with extra<br/>notes in the factor remapping channel, and I could then run<br/>them all through FTS to retune them.</p><p>So that might be another approach to explore,...<br/>..............................................</p><p>&gt; I wrote 3-part hexany canon in the late 70&apos;s in order to do this very<br/>&gt; thing, but it&apos;s long gone and I like what you&apos;ve done better. :)</p><p>Glad you like it :-)</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=27960 href="#27960">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/7/2001 10:02:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Sounds fun.

Could be a useful thing to have.</p><p>I would say definitely yes.</p><p>&gt; After one of your earlier posts, I thought of idea of adding a<br/>remapping<br/>&gt; channel to FTS.</p><p>I would say whatever you do, it should allow you to at least take the<br/>set of all notes which appear in a given piece, and remap them to<br/>other notes; it doesn&apos;t seem to me what you are talking about below<br/>does that. There are other kinds of remappings which this won&apos;t<br/>support but I think getting at least that far would be grand.</p><p>&gt; Could just save the .midi file prefixing the piece with all 48<br/>combinations for<br/>&gt; the factor remapping channel, and then play each of those in turn<br/>&gt; and record them as one does so, though a bit awkward finding out the<br/>&gt; combinations of reflections to use for each one (maybe I&apos;m missing<br/>some<br/>&gt; simplification here).</p><p>The whole thing can be done by matrix products as S4 factors nicely,<br/>unlike some less well-behaved groups.</p><p>When I did this stuff 20-25 years ago, I had an HP workstation (not<br/>as good as a PC of today, but it made up for it by being larger and<br/>far more expensive) which my brother would borrow from work over the<br/>holidays and a black box he made which controlled four channels<br/>outputting square waves and tuned by a frequency divider. It wasn&apos;t<br/>very musical by today&apos;s standards, but it *was* in tune and readily<br/>controllable by simple programs which also could do matrix<br/>operations, etc. What a Christmas it was when the whole family was<br/>forced to listen to beloved Christmas carols transformed in weird<br/>ways! I&apos;d like to get up to that speed at least.</p></div>
