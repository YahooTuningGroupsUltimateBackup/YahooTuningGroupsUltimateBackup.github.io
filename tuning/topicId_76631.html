My name&apos;s Rick Ballan. Bill Sethares suggested I contact you. As a jazz guitarist I don&apos;t get much chance to play in alternate tunings and so do most of my stuff on my humble calculator.

My &quot;system&quot; is not very rigorous but it does seem to give me some results. For eg given the minor 3rd , 2 to the power of 1/4 =  1.1892..., I take 2 to the power of N + 1/4, N = 0, 1, 2, 3,..., either round it off to nearest odd number or, if the whole numbered part is already odd, ignore the numbers after the decimal point, and then divide by 2 to the power of N to get the nearest octave. Many values of N will simply give octaves so then I just move on. 2 to the power of 4.25 (i.e. N = 4) gives 19.027...rounds to 19 and 19/16 = 1.1875. The next relevant value is N = 9 giving 609/512 = 1.189453125.</p><p>Now my question is: are our tempered intervals truly irrational, which would make them aperiodic and non-tonal by definition, or is it really the case that they approximate these or other ratios in the rarefied upper realms of the harmonic series? In other words, perhaps there is a limit to what we can do in the physical world and we can only create (and/or hear) to a few decimal places?</p><p>Thanks folks and please excuse my ignorance cause I&apos;m new to this field.</p><p>      Get the name you always wanted with the new y7mail email address.<br/><a href="http://www.yahoo7.com.au/mail">www.yahoo7.com.au/mail</a></p></div><h3>Aaron Wolf &#x3C;wolftune@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2008 8:25:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Equal-tempered intervals are theoretically irrational.</p><p>Beyond that, every strange variation of temperament has been tried at<br/>some time.</p><p>Problem is, who cares what the mathematical rationality is if people<br/>can&apos;t experience a difference?  As Bill explains so wonderfully,<br/>timbre has a major factor in that.  And the limits of human perception<br/>and psychology do as well.</p><p>Some of these questions have not been scientifically answered yet, but<br/>it is my opinion that by trying to rationalize 12ET, you are just<br/>trying to find patterns and conclusions where there aren&apos;t any.  12ET<br/>is essentially related to Pythagorean and meantone temperaments and so<br/>essentially works with thirds and fifths.  But, instruments are so<br/>rarely tuned to perfect temperament that all sorts of other issues are<br/>there.</p><p>I&apos;ll put it this way: if you aren&apos;t carefully intonating your guitar<br/>as &quot;perfect&quot; as possible, and then playing extremely long sustained<br/>chords with absolutely no vibrato or bending, then you aren&apos;t<br/>harmonically focusing on some exact rational harmony.  Jazz guitar is<br/>based more on vaguely going toward certain more or less consonant<br/>sounds, but really based more on voice-leading than on specific harmonies.</p><p>-Aaron Wolf</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, rick ballan &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi everyone.

Yes I suppose that&apos;s one way of stating the question. More precisely this gap between the abstract real numbers and those which are actually tuned or performed is not only one between the ideal and reality, but more importantly between periodicity and aperiodicity. As you no doubt know, given a ratio between two frequencies a/b where a and b are whole, then the resultant wave will be periodic, the frequency being the highest common factor between the two. Extending this to all possible combinations, then the class of these represents both the number of &quot;instruments&quot; which could play this frequency (note) and also the basis of harmonic intervals/chords i.e. tonality. But if the waves bear an irrational relation, then a and b do not exist and no periodic wave is produced (e.g. Pythagoras&apos; proof that no ratio a/b corresponds to the sq root of 2, which is the flat-fifth interval).</p><p>Now the reason I ask is not in my capacity as a jazz guitarist but because I&apos;ve written a theoretical physics paper on general wave theory that applies to electro-magnetics and quantum waves as well, and which is currently being reviewed at Sydney uni. If all waves are in reality periodic, then they are also harmonic. In fact my paper shows many mathematical proof to this effect. It does this by showing that it always leads into self-contradiction otherwise. It also debunks much of the experimental evidence used as &quot;proof&quot; that light and matter waves are irrational.

Yes I suppose that&apos;s one way of stating the &gt; question. More<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; precisely this gap between the abstract real numbers and those &gt; which are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; actually tuned or performed is not only one between the ideal and<br/>&gt; &gt; reality,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but more importantly between periodicity and aperiodicity. As &gt; you no<br/>&gt; &gt; doubt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; know, given a ratio between two frequencies a/b where a and b &gt; are whole,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; then the resultant wave will be periodic, the frequency being the<br/>&gt; &gt; highest<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; common factor between the two. Extending this to all possible<br/>&gt; &gt; combinations,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; then the class of these represents both the number of &gt; &quot;instruments&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; could play this frequency (note) and also the basis of harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intervals/chords i.e. tonality. But if the waves bear an &gt; irrational<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; relation, then a and b do not exist and no periodic wave is &gt; produced<br/>&gt; &gt; (e.g.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Pythagoras&apos; proof that no ratio a/b corresponds to the sq root &gt; of 2,<br/>&gt; &gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is the flat-fifth interval).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now the reason I ask is not in my capacity as a jazz guitarist but<br/>&gt; &gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ve written a theoretical physics paper on general wave theory &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; applies<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to electro-magnetics and quantum waves as well, and which is<br/>&gt; &gt; currently being<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; reviewed at Sydney uni. If all waves are in reality periodic, then<br/>&gt; &gt; they are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; also harmonic. In fact my paper shows many mathematical proof to &gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; effect. It does this by showing that it always leads into<br/>&gt; &gt; self-contradiction<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise. It also debunks much of the experimental evidence &gt; used as<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;proof&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that light and matter waves are irrational. So you see that to<br/>&gt; &gt; answer this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; question precisely will have repercussions throughout all of<br/>&gt; &gt; physics.

Yes I suppose that&apos;s one way of stating the question. More<br/>&gt; &gt; precisely this gap between the abstract real numbers and those which are<br/>&gt; &gt; actually tuned or performed is not only one between the ideal and<br/>&gt; reality,<br/>&gt; &gt; but more importantly between periodicity and aperiodicity. As you no<br/>&gt; doubt<br/>&gt; &gt; know, given a ratio between two frequencies a/b where a and b are whole,<br/>&gt; &gt; then the resultant wave will be periodic, the frequency being the<br/>&gt; highest<br/>&gt; &gt; common factor between the two. Extending this to all possible<br/>&gt; combinations,<br/>&gt; &gt; then the class of these represents both the number of &quot;instruments&quot;<br/>&gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt; could play this frequency (note) and also the basis of harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals/chords i.e. tonality. But if the waves bear an irrational<br/>&gt; &gt; relation, then a and b do not exist and no periodic wave is produced<br/>&gt; (e.g.<br/>&gt; &gt; Pythagoras&apos; proof that no ratio a/b corresponds to the sq root of 2,<br/>&gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt; is the flat-fifth interval).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now the reason I ask is not in my capacity as a jazz guitarist but<br/>&gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve written a theoretical physics paper on general wave theory that<br/>&gt; applies<br/>&gt; &gt; to electro-magnetics and quantum waves as well, and which is<br/>&gt; currently being<br/>&gt; &gt; reviewed at Sydney uni. If all waves are in reality periodic, then<br/>&gt; they are<br/>&gt; &gt; also harmonic. In fact my paper shows many mathematical proof to this<br/>&gt; &gt; effect. It does this by showing that it always leads into<br/>&gt; self-contradiction<br/>&gt; &gt; otherwise. It also debunks much of the experimental evidence used as<br/>&gt; &quot;proof&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; that light and matter waves are irrational.

Bit nerve racking as I was only invited<br/>&gt; &gt; last night at 1am and I haven&apos;t touched the guitar for weeks.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----<br/>&gt; &gt; From: Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@... &gt; &lt;mailto:kraiggrady%<a href="http://40anaphoria.com">40anaphoria.com</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, 28 May, 2008 7:28:54 AM<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Hi!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; having heard JI in a various degrees of accuracy, the closer and more<br/>&gt; &gt; you get to perfect, there is a logarithmic sweep toward various<br/>&gt; &gt; phenomenon.

Yes I suppose that&apos;s one way of stating the question.<br/>&gt; &gt; More<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; precisely this gap between the abstract real numbers and those<br/>&gt; &gt; which are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually tuned or performed is not only one between the ideal and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; reality,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but more importantly between periodicity and aperiodicity. As you no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; doubt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know, given a ratio between two frequencies a/b where a and b are<br/>&gt; &gt; whole,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then the resultant wave will be periodic, the frequency being the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; highest<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; common factor between the two. Extending this to all possible<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; combinations,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then the class of these represents both the number of &quot;instruments&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could play this frequency (note) and also the basis of harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intervals/chords i.e. tonality. But if the waves bear an irrational<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relation, then a and b do not exist and no periodic wave is produced<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (e.g.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pythagoras&apos; proof that no ratio a/b corresponds to the sq root of 2,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the flat-fifth interval).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now the reason I ask is not in my capacity as a jazz guitarist but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ve written a theoretical physics paper on general wave theory that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; applies<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to electro-magnetics and quantum waves as well, and which is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; currently being<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reviewed at Sydney uni. If all waves are in reality periodic, then<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; they are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also harmonic. In fact my paper shows many mathematical proof to &gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effect. It does this by showing that it always leads into<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; self-contradiction<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise. It also debunks much of the experimental evidence used as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;proof&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that light and matter waves are irrational. So you see that to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; answer this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question precisely will have repercussions throughout all of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; physics. Bill<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sethares suggested that I get you guys onto the problem because you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; are the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ones to do it and the more experimental proof the better.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again Carl<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rick<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Carl Lumma &lt;carl@... &lt;mailto:carl%<a href="http://40lumma.org">40lumma.org</a>&gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:carl%<a href="http://40lumma.org">40lumma.org</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:carl% <a href="http://40lumma.org">40lumma.org</a>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: tuning@yahoogroups. com &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;mailto:tuning% 40yahoogroups. com&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, 27 May, 2008 2:33:31 AM<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Hi!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Rick,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Now my question is: are our tempered intervals truly irrational,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; which would make them aperiodic and non-tonal by definition, or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is it really the case that they approximate these or other ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in the rarefied upper realms of the harmonic series? In other<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; words, perhaps there is a limit to what we can do in the physical<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; world and we can only create (and/or hear) to a few decimal places?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The intervals exist abstractly with infinite precision but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of course can never be tuned or performed with infinite<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; precision.
