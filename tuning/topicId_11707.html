One of the files would<br/>not appear on the <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site after about a week... so I uploaded it<br/>AGAIN, and now it is appearing.</p><p>THEN, I reordered the files...  they are STILL not perfect, since<br/><a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> has not moved the 4:5:6:7 JI experiment near the others yet,<br/>as I have wished.  I believe they are totally taken up with a new<br/>interface they just rolled out... so updates are abnormally slow.</p><p>ANYWAY... it&apos;s almost &quot;perfect.&quot;  Just realize the 4:5:6:7 JI example<br/>should be with the others.</p><p>HERE IS THE URL:</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/140/tuning_lab.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/140/tuning_lab.html</a></p><p>These examples were all created by Paul on his MATLAB program.</p><p>The first example is a JI tetrad 4:5:6:7</p><p>The next example is an approximate 4:5:6:7 in Paul&apos;s 22-tET</p><p>Finally, there is a dominant 7th chord in 12-tET</p><p>For me, the beatings grow gradually from JI to 22 to 12... I don&apos;t<br/>believe much of an unexpected result...</p><p>NEXT, Paul deals with the UTONAL world with a half-diminished 7th:</p><p>JI 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4</p><p>THEN, there is an approximation of the same chord 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4<br/>derived from 22-tET.</p><p>FINALLY... Paul compares the utonal half-diminished sevenths with<br/>OTONAL half diminished sevenths:</p><p>JI 5:6:7:9</p><p>The approximation of 5:6:7:9 in 22-tET</p><p>and, finally, a half-diminished 7th in 12-tET.</p><p>Results??</p><p>Well, I was rather startled as to how similar the utonal and otonal<br/>half-diminished sevenths sounded.  It was MUCH different than in the<br/>Daniel Wolf example, where I believed I was hearing chords come &quot;into<br/>focus&quot; in the otonal version.</p><p>Paul had an explanation for me:</p><p>&gt;Well, there was an important difference in the Daniel Wolf example<br/>--<br/>&gt;the otonal chord there had a bass note that was equivalent to the<br/>&gt;otonal root,while in this example (half-diminished) it doesn&apos;t.</p><p>Anyway, I hope everyone enjoys the LISTENING experience.  For me,<br/>also, it is a crucial point of it all.</p><p>I have to admit I have been astonished by Paul&apos;s recent posts with<br/>the<br/>tetrads from harmonic entropy space...</p><p>His suggestion in the important post #11686:</p><p>&gt;Many of the chords above come from a<br/>&gt;standard application of 5-limit JI to tetrads found in the diatonic<br/>&gt;scale (including melodic minor and harmonic minor variants), but<br/>many<br/>&gt;are tempered in a subtle way,and some are downright xenharmonic. An<br/>&gt;excellent exercise for a composer looking for points of stability in<br/>&gt;the infinite realm of microtonal harmony would be to spend some<br/>&gt;time with the chords above.</p><p>was not lost on &quot;deaf ears.&quot;  This study was amazingly exhaustive<br/>(virtually &quot;mind blowing&quot; if you include the graphics, but enough on<br/>that!).  What a way to approach consonance!  (or concordance, or<br/>whatever...)</p><p>I&apos;m only hoping I can persuade Paul to let me post some of these<br/>tetrads as SOUND files on my little &quot;Tuning Lab&quot; <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site!  I<br/>want<br/>to HEAR the results of the experiment!</p><p>_________ ____ __ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2000 3:41:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Well, I was rather startled as to how similar the utonal and otonal<br/>&gt;half-diminished sevenths sounded.
