Looking through the &quot;Andrus&quot; through &quot;Vath&quot; set of<br/>&gt;keyboard mappings, you can see Wilson trying out all the possibilities,<br/>&gt;including 12/11+11/10, 11/10+10/9, and 10/9+9/8 (the last to add 13s to the</p><p>&gt;diamond).</p><p>Where can one find these? Are they all 41 tones? Anyway, I think it telling<br/>that Wilson settled on the middle one for Xenharmonikon.</p></div><h3>Paul H.
