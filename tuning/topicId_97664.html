I fixed a lot of bugs and unexpected behavior for this release (over the last year). There are a few functional improvements too. I was holding back on publishing it because I wanted to include MIDI support in the next release, but that&apos;s stalled and still way off. I&apos;m sorry for that.<br/>It also doesn&apos;t look like I&apos;ll be able to spend much time on Rationale or microtonal music in the near future, so this could end up being the last version. That&apos;s not so useful for those who want to use MIDI, but for anyone who used Rationale before, it should be much more reliable now.</p><p>-Chuckk</p></div>
