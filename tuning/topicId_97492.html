This is why Jon Catler does all his demos with an overdriven guitar rather than a clean one--if it&apos;s clean, the difference is too subtle.  Even on a piano, the difference is subtle enough to pass most listeners&apos; ears unnoticed (unless you&apos;re using non-12ish intervals, of course).

I noticed when I was progressively flattening the 9/7 that the beating (discordance) did indeed seem to lessen and the flattened intervals sounded smoother. On the other hand the intervals that were closer to &quot;just&quot; sounded more &quot;resolved&quot;. My gut feeling (perhaps because the math looks cuter) is that I would choose &quot;more resolved&quot; over &quot;less beating&quot;.</p><p>Next I tried 1/1. I tempered the 1/1 by +6.7 cents and it sounded good. Next I raised it by +8 cents and it definitely sounded sour.

I flattened 2/1 by -26 cents and the beating was *very* obvious but not &quot;nasty&quot;. I tried a -29 cents tempering and the beating began to sound nasty. In this case the -27 cents tolerance is questionable but I wouldn&apos;t use a tempered octave in a scale so maybe it doesn&apos;t matter.</p><p>Next I tried 5/4 and again, flattening the interval by 27 cents, it still sounded &quot;clean&quot;.

You said that the 5/4 can tolerate more mistuning when you flatten it than if you sharpen it. You were right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I started with 9/7, a weak interval. I tempered it by +6.5 cents and it still sounded okay. Then I raised it by +8 cents and it sounded sour (so my 6.776 cents &quot;upper&quot; threshold seems good so far). Going the other way (flattening the 9/7) I found that I could flatten the 9/7 by as much as 27 cents and it still sounded &quot;clean&quot;. Flattening by 28 cents or more the 9/7 sounded sour.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You said that sometimes the greater the error, the less the discordance and you were right again. I noticed when I was progressively flattening the 9/7 that the beating (discordance) did indeed seem to lessen and the flattened intervals sounded smoother. On the other hand the intervals that were closer to &quot;just&quot; sounded more &quot;resolved&quot;. My gut feeling (perhaps because the math looks cuter) is that I would choose &quot;more resolved&quot; over &quot;less beating&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Next I tried 1/1. I tempered the 1/1 by +6.7 cents and it sounded good. Next I raised it by +8 cents and it definitely sounded sour. So again my 6.776 cents &quot;upper&quot; threshold seems good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Next I tried 2/1. I raised it by 6.7 cents and it was good. +8 cents and it was sour. I flattened 2/1 by -26 cents and the beating was *very* obvious but not &quot;nasty&quot;. I tried a -29 cents tempering and the beating began to sound nasty. In this case the -27 cents tolerance is questionable but I wouldn&apos;t use a tempered octave in a scale so maybe it doesn&apos;t matter.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Next I tried 5/4 and again, flattening the interval by 27 cents, it still sounded &quot;clean&quot;. Next I tried -29 cents and I didn&apos;t like it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By coincidence 64/63 is between 27 cents and 28 cents. This is similar to 256/255 (i.e. 2^N/(2^N - 1). So if I had to choose precise values for tempering I would choose +6.776 cents (256/255) for the upper tolerance and -27.264 cents (64/63) for the lower tolerance. I can&apos;t prove that these precise values are correct but they look cute and seem reasonable when tested.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;john777music&quot; &lt;jfos777@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you give me an example of an interval where the greater the error the less the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; discordance?
