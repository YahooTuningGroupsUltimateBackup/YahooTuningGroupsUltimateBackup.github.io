This must be muqadderat<br/>&gt; &gt; (predestination) as I&apos;m used to say, although I&apos;m a Mutazilite now, that<br/>&gt; &gt; your re-appearance coincides with my mention of you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was just reading about Mu&apos;taziliya the other day, and I have been having<br/>a<br/>&gt; lot of cases of synchronicity lately, like this one. (I&apos;m getting caught<br/>up<br/>&gt; on philosophy in general, particularly ancient Greek and Chinese.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I think I want to use your 8:10:14:19:23 chord in something now, and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 12:15:21:28:35 can be a 7-limit alternative.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Did you also try 12:15:21:28:35:36(:38) ?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Also check out 8:10:14:19:23:27.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The chord 12:15:21:28:35 in the key of E would be notated E-G#-Dd-Gd-Bd<br/>&gt; using Turkish accidentals; in 41-tone*, the pitches are<br/>&gt; 0-13-33-50(9)-63(22). Despite having that semi-diminished twelfth (which I<br/>&gt; normally equate to 32/11 rather than 35/12), the chord isn&apos;t that<br/>dissonant<br/>&gt; compared to any other complex jazz chord. The secondary major third on the<br/>&gt; septimal minor seventh helps a lot. But I wouldn&apos;t recommend adding the<br/>&gt; perfect twelfth; the chord gets a little painful. A perfect fifth would<br/>work<br/>&gt; better since it wouldn&apos;t create that 35:36 quartertone cluster, and it<br/>would<br/>&gt; give more emphasis to the root, making the chord sound less like a major<br/>&gt; third with utonally-related notes attached beneath. (That would create a<br/>&gt; 12:15:18:21:28:35 chord.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m listening to the chord with the &quot;tense&quot; major eleventh (27/8, the note<br/>&gt; C#|) now, and that adds to the subminor seventh something similar to a<br/>&gt; semi-diminished octave. I&apos;m using the basic piano sound on my computer&apos;s<br/>&gt; MIDI output, and I don&apos;t hear the note very well, so we might be going<br/>over<br/>&gt; the note limit now.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; *41-tone meaning 41-EDO or something close to it; I use my own<br/>&gt; &quot;well-tempered&quot; Pythagorean tuning with that many notes per octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~Danny~<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=66191 href="#66191">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel A.

Sadly, the space in between the semitone mandal and the nut (which<br/>is manipulated to yield an exact 100 cents) is divided equally into 6 parts,<br/>practically resulting in 72 equal divisions of the octave.</p><p>Some Qanun makers are not even concerned with octave-equivalances, so they<br/>divide the space in between the semitone mandal and the nut in the lower<br/>registers into 7 portions (because, those mandals are too far apart<br/>otherwise, they say!), effectively arriving at 84 equal divisions of the<br/>octave.</p><p>The disastrous consequences of this habit not only cancels the claims of the<br/>theory in force defending 53-tET, but also wreaks havoc in Maqam Music<br/>ensembles.</p><p>As it happens, aged veterans in the field agreed with my observation through<br/>their personal experience and exasperation. &grave;Being in unison like a Western<br/>string orchestra is such a big problem!&grave; they said. Add to this known facts<br/>such as the absence of bowing directions, dynamics, nuances, etc... we have<br/>every musician trying to be a soloist.</p><p>All this said and done, I defended my position that Maqam Music required the<br/>grounds for a common music theory education over which all instrumental<br/>disciplines may be unified. Such a theory required no less voluminous a<br/>tuning than 79 MOS 159-tET.</p><p>I brushed aside flimsy objections such as that the Tanbur could not<br/>accompany a 79-tone Qanun. Can not a violin accompany a 12-tone piano,<br/>although the violinist tends to evade 12-tone equal temperament as much as<br/>he can? All it matters is to pick so many tones out of 79 MOS 159-tET as we<br/>may need. Afterall, we do urgently require a clarification of the complexity<br/>of Maqam Music pitches, and organize them in a well-rounded temperament<br/>solution, I reminded.</p><p>In light of my explanations, and the supportive demonstrations of the famed<br/>Qanun-performer Halil Karaduman, my presentation was a huge success!</p><p>The Excel file of the tuning (however incomplete) is here:<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/anonymous/79tone.xls">http://www.ozanyarman.com/anonymous/79tone.xls</a></p><p>No less important is Jon L. Smith&apos;s 79 tone tempered 11-U composition (fresh<br/>from the oven, and marvelously Maqamic) which I played from the computer to<br/>the audience. (Jon, share it with us!) This is only a sneak-peak into the<br/>microtonal possibilities, I declared.</p><p>I also showed how Sagittal accidentals should be used. This is the comma<br/>sign, 2-comma sign, 1/4 tone sign... flip &grave;em down, flip &grave;em up. We only<br/>need to learn 3 more accidentals besides sharps and flats, I stated.</p><p>The whole-tone Sagittal spectrum can be seen in the JPG files attached.</p><p>George, I think you will like to hear that the notation proposal was very<br/>much acknowledged.
