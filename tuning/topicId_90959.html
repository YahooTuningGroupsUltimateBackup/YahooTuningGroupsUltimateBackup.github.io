They are usually defined in terms of just intonation only, but needn&apos;t be, and the three are related. They are the genus, the cps, and the diamond. The genus of a multiset is all products of all elements of the multiset, where the product is a product of note classes, ie, take the product of notes, reduce to the octave, and those are your classes. In a special case this gives the Euler genus. The cps, or combination product (multi)set, is like the genus except you take not all products but products taken some number k at a time. The eikosanies are a special case. The diamond takes all ratios of two elements. All of these can start from multisets or sets and produce bigger multisets or sets, and so can be iterated or combined. Any scale in the Scala directory, or any chord in any tuning, can have any one of these applied to it, with results which are pretty much unexplored territory. Don&apos;t bother applying them to edos, however.</p></div><h3>Domina Catrina Lee &#x3C;ahulijing@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2010 1:13:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carl<br/>your example sounds gorgeous.<br/>Wish I could get my head around the numbers and terms :(</p><p>Catrina</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;sevishmusic&quot; &lt;sevish@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I hear of this idea... it&apos;s called Eikosany.
