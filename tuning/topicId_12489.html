I would like to ask if it is appropriate to apply the kind of<br/>analysis to the &quot;overlapping&quot; properties of the diatonic scale<br/>degrees that you demonstrated yesterday with the modal grid? Perhaps<br/>working with this as an example, I can grasp better the idea.</p><p>I would like to state that this type of scale is something that is<br/>quite a bit off the beaten trail for me - something kind of new. The<br/>primary scales that I&apos;m most familiar with, in a compositional sense,<br/>are much more oriented/derived from the harmonic series . When I was<br/>confronted with the question of  &quot;what may I contribute to our Tuning<br/>Lab?&quot;, something came to mind that I remember reading that Varese<br/>said: &quot;I don&apos;t write experimental music&quot;. Which I think I remember<br/>him meaning, that by the time the music is written, the<br/>experimentation is long over. Definitely an idea that resonates with<br/>me, because way before I record one midi or audio track, I have made<br/>great effort to internalize the tuning that I&apos;m working with, by<br/>improvising and trying out allot of different timbres. But there is<br/>always that moment when you try something new - when you are hearing<br/>a unique scale for the first time, that is the &quot;experimental&quot; phase<br/>of a composition. This is the essence of what I was trying to<br/>demonstrate with this first trip to the Lab and the All Prime Scale.<br/>At first I wasn&apos;t even sure if were possible to find ratios that<br/>would meet the two criteria, but was pleased to find that there are a<br/>plenty of them that would work. Sometimes a huge difficulty that I<br/>have about considering something &quot;experimental&quot; is that I&apos;ve had so<br/>many years of satisfying and successful compositional experiences<br/>working within Just Intonation, that I find myself often without -<br/>and perfectly empty of - anything to prove in an experimental sense.<br/>The vocabulary is ingrained, to the point that I may take it for<br/>granted, and not see it as an experiment any longer - even to the<br/>point of accepting and using compositionally, many JI phenomenon that<br/>might not rest easy on all ears. But this week, from the listening<br/>test that we had around your composition, I am compelled toward<br/>probing into the questions that arise from the experiencing Neutral<br/>intervals.</p><p>Infinite Thanks,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a couple of quick analytical type ruminations for whatever<br/>&gt; they&apos;re worth...
