It&apos;s fairly easy when there are only pairs of frets, as to<br/>sound the lower note you can press down below the the pair or on the<br/>pair for sharp keys, although to play the centre fret of the trio<br/>will require extremely precise finger positioning, which could<br/>inhibit performance speed.</p><p>It becomes a trade-off between accuracy and speed, which is why I<br/>have only used 19 frets per octave on my favourite LucyTuned 12<br/>string guitar, to make it to easier to play chords.</p><p>Charles Lucy <a href="mailto:lucy@lucytune.com">lucy@lucytune.com</a></p><p>-----  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -----</p><p>For information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>LucyTuned Lullabies (from around the world):<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p><p>Skype user = lucytune</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/lucytuning">http://www.myspace.com/lucytuning</a></p><p>On 5 Nov 2007, at 04:54, Ozan Yarman wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Do not forget the third chain of 19-edo, which is 39 cents higher<br/>&gt; than the first and follows the pattern:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 14.239 cents<br/>&gt; 24.459 cents<br/>&gt; 24.459 cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: Charles Lucy<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Sent: 05 Kas&imath;m 2007 Pazartesi 1:46<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Another &quot;perspective&quot; on A 57-tone tuning based<br/>&gt; on the 38-tone minimal tuning for maqam music<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From what I read of Oz&apos;s description, I understand the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To me this tuning that Oz is attempting to define is most easily<br/>&gt; considered as steps of 1200/19 = 63.15789 cents.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One starting from 0 cents i.e. 0, 63.15789, 126.3158 etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i.e. regular common or &quot;old&quot; garden 19 edo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; plus a second set 19 steps of the same interval starting from 14.24<br/>&gt; cents:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i.e. 14.24, (63.15789 + 14.24)= 77.39789; (14.24+126.3158) etc. ......<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This will result in a tuning having 38 intervals per octave with<br/>&gt; the following ascending alternate interval pattern.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 14.24, 48.91789,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I have understood correctly this begins to look very similar to<br/>&gt; the pattern which is seen on the fretting of LucyTuned guitars?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; see pictures and numbers here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lucytune.com/guitars_and_frets/frets.html">http://www.lucytune.com/guitars_and_frets/frets.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i.e 19 very approximately equal steps as in 19 edo, which as you<br/>&gt; add more frets (i.e. beyond 19) generates a similar pattern which<br/>&gt; is offset by 14.37 cents (2L-3s) cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; see <a href="http://www.lucytune.com/new_to_lt/pitch_02.html">http://www.lucytune.com/new_to_lt/pitch_02.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This pattern works very well on fretted instruments, as in practice<br/>&gt; if you are playing in a &quot;flat&quot; key you finger below the pair of<br/>&gt; close frets;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; if in a &quot;sharp&quot; key you finger on the pair of frets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I appreciate that this is another example of seeing the world only<br/>&gt; from where one is standing, yet my perspective (&quot;insight?&quot;) may be<br/>&gt; helpful for others in visualising the &quot;connectedness&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; between some of the new diverse patterns which exploring tunaniks<br/>&gt; are discovering.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW if you have more than 38 frets per octave on your LucyTuned<br/>&gt; guitar, the 39th fret which you add begins a pattern of three<br/>&gt; &quot;close frets&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which then begins to fill the &quot;spaces&apos; until you get a total of 19*3;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and the 58th fret begins to make a pattern of four close frets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Continuing to add frets you eventually end up with &quot;all frets and<br/>&gt; no board&quot;; which after all is where you began i.e. &quot;all board and<br/>&gt; no frets&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry for rambling.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Charles Lucy <a href="mailto:lucy@lucytune.com">lucy@lucytune.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div>
