So, I am unwilling to negate your question.</p><p>  at least sometimes I personally have always like working with constant structures that didn&apos;t repeat at the octave . for instance take 12 ET and treat it as a 19 tone sequence of semitones and take the 12 tone subsets of that.</p><p>Uh, I tend to think that it would be quite messy to do so.</p><p>  When your original set of intervals are not equally space one has a plethora of variations depending on the different modes. going the opposite direction is also quite musical. treating say 7 tones out of 12 as you interval of equivalence. from there you pull out the &apos;pentatonic therein. both these i have used in actual pieces, recorded on some of my recordings.</p><p>I have to listen in order to comment further.</p><p>  As i mentioned when your base scale, is not equal this leads to some really interesting variations as you proceed up and down that gives ones melodic lines a dynamic quality, that forces harmony to follow on its heels. the basic mos application i first lean from Erv, who also has applied the viggo brun algorithm in similar fashion to non octive intervals.</p><p>Viggo-brun algorithm? Do please explain.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div>
