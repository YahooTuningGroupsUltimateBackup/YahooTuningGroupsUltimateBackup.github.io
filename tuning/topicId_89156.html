It is only, I would like to use Strasheela to create these demos, because then I could use them in other contexts as well (e.g., as examples in some publication). If there would be (some close approximation of) 1/4-comma meantone with a long enough chain of fifths available, then I could start right away. The reason is that Strasheela already supports 31-TET very well (e.g., with a large database of chords/scales, rules on harmony and counterpoint etc.), and so it &quot;knows&quot; all the interval relations of 1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>As I said, I am currently working towards Strasheela support for arbitrary regular temperaments, so I could model the interval relations of many of your tunings in Strasheela. However, it takes some additional time, and there are currently so many other things to do...  On the other hand, adding support for arbitrary regular temperaments is certainly worth its time and I am already close :)</p><p>&gt; It seems we had some misunderstanding with Mezzo, that you did not<br/>&gt; notice was mentionned in the scl file of Appalachian ... ?</p><p>Sorry, I did not search all scl files for some mentioning of of the word &quot;Mezzo&quot; :)  I checked it right now: so, Mezzo is a close approximation of 1/4-comma meantone after all.</p><p>Sorry for repeating this question, but could  this tuning be extended into a chain of 23 fifths (i.e. 24 tones), so that more 7-limit intervals are available? It would save me a couple of days to actually start creating 7-limit demos.</p><p>&gt; Will try to answer later to your last messages on the TL as I can<br/>&gt; suggest another super great fractal generator for 7-limit, which is<br/>&gt; what you would need in fact as giving priority to 7 over 5 would be<br/>&gt; more logical.</p><p>Thank you, and sorry for taking so much of your time in this matter.</p><p>Best wishes,<br/>Torsten</p><p>--<br/>Torsten Anders<br/>Interdisciplinary Centre for Computer Music Research<br/>University of Plymouth<br/>Office: +44-1752-586219<br/>Private: +44-1752-558917<br/><a href="http://strasheela.sourceforge.net">http://strasheela.sourceforge.net</a><br/><a href="http://www.torsten-anders.de">http://www.torsten-anders.de</a></p></div><h3><a id=89164 href="#89164">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/12/2010 8:27:39 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Torsten Anders &lt;torsten.anders@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; publication).

The tuning is defined as<br/>&gt; follows (I am copying the whole file including the comments here).</p><p>And my answer of the 27th of april explained everything about that tuning and its recurrent sequence, which is Mezzo, and how close it is to the 1/4 syntonic comma meantone.</p><p>&gt; Sorry for repeating this question, but could this tuning be extended<br/>&gt; into a chain of 23 fifths (i.e. 24 tones), so that more 7-limit<br/>&gt; intervals are available?

I offered you two solutions :<br/>1) transposition of the whole scale by 125/128, this extends to 24 tones.<br/>2) or if it&apos;s simpler for you or for Strasheela, using the Mezzo generator<br/>1.495352392466 = 696.5826088 c. as many times as you want.<br/>Can you write these scala files, or do you want me to do it for you ?<br/>And I said also that 10 generators will approximate the 7th harmonic :<br/>= by 965.826088 c., or 3 c. less than 7/4.</p><p>Now if you would rather use 31-TET, you should do it !<br/>I don&apos;t know exactly what you want to do, and my advise might not be useful, but if you plan to make use of 7-limit harmonies and you have no precise idea of the meantone you want to use, what I would suggest is to give priority to 7 over 5. I have plenty of eq-b meantones that play with 7, and for many reasons the more useful ones approximate 7/4 with lower, never with higher intervals.</p><p>Close to 31-edo are  :<br/>Heptapand x^10 = 96 - 8x^4  &gt; 696,81497441532 c.<br/>Saptendre x^10 = 8x + 44  &gt; 696.77164940052 c.</p><p>Closer to 1/4 syntonic there is<br/>Sapnat x^10 = 16x + 32  &gt; 696.65567529288 c.</p><p>Then perhaps the most terrific -c  and eq-b meantone playing with 7 would be<br/>Saprad x^10 = 32x + 8   &gt; 696.407171331 c.</p><p>And I maintain that close to Golden,<br/>Tara x^4 = x + 7/2    &gt; 696.14304361824 c.<br/>is very special as it bridges 5 and 7, but might be a little more complex to use if you&apos;re not familiar with differential coherence - and obviously, transposition by 7/4 is obviously the secret here.</p><p>One more to bridge 7 and 5, close to 50-edo :<br/>Pandore x^9 = 64 - 8x3  &gt; 696,02379131532 c.</p><p>- - - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques</p></div><h3><a id=89191 href="#89191">ðŸ”—</a>Torsten Anders &#x3C;torsten.anders@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/13/2010 4:16:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Jacques,</p><p>sorry, I certainly did not mean to annoy you.</p><p>On 13.05.2010, at 22:59, Jacques Dudon wrote:<br/>&gt; There is a mystery here...

And it&apos;s quite logical that by extending a meantone over 12 tones you may pass by near 19 and 31 tones divisions.<br/>With 24 tones, you will have I guess a 19 + 5 structure somehow.<br/>The best thing is to try it ! Then either discard the 5 doubles or add 7 more for 31 if you want DE divisions.
