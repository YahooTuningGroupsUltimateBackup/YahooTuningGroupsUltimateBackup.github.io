Since these events are not physically simultaneous, the<br/>&gt;relationships that they create are perceived when we associate the<br/>events in short term memory.8  It then follows that to perceive a<br/>collection of tones as tonal, we must be able to maintain that<br/>collection in short term memoryan inability to recall the<br/>collection<br/>precludes our detecting any relationships within it. When unprocessed<br/>data is continuously crowded out of short term memory, we perceive<br/>atonality.</p><p>I dunno.  This seems pretty &quot;simplistic&quot; to me.  In other words, if<br/>we are perceiving the patterns &quot;correctly&quot; in short-term memory we<br/>are always hearing &quot;tonality,&quot; otherwise &quot;atonality&quot; as<br/>a &quot;deficiency.&quot;</p><p>How does that explain the perception of atonal patterns that are<br/>integral units of a composition where no tonality is either desired<br/>or part of the linguistic framework?</p><p>Atonality, it seems, is an *entirely* different language that is set<br/>up by cultural acceptance of certain intervallic patterns *outside*<br/>of any tonal framework.</p><p>This is why, to a novice, atonality can sometimes seem unappealing,<br/>but after further exposure to the language, it begins to make sense...</p><p>There&apos;s nothing &quot;lacking&quot; in it, or outside of the capabilities of<br/>perception...</p><p>&gt;In the case of modern music, no perceptual model has yet won the<br/>&gt;general acceptance of the musical establishmentalthough models<br/>&gt;powerful enough to accommodate contemporary styles have been<br/>formulated.14  This being so, we can attribute the continued<br/>perception of atonality not only to the public&apos;s insufficient<br/>exposure to contemporary music (exposure too limited to reveal the<br/>tonality that exists in complex music), but also to the institutional<br/>rejection of conceptual frameworks which, if applied, could bring<br/>about a revolution in musical perception.</p><p>Huh??  How about the 12-tone system?  It seems that such models have<br/>been *more* than adequately formulated!</p><p>So then, *everything* relates to some kind of &quot;tonality.&quot;  I guess<br/>that was Schoenberg&apos;s idea, but it is somewhat stretching a point...</p><p>It all rests on definitions... but, to me, &quot;tonality&quot; has something<br/>to do with an organization related to the overtone system<br/>and &quot;atonality&quot; to set organization of pitches perceived, perhaps, by<br/>their relationship to one another... not necessarily related so<br/>directly to the overtone series as a &quot;deficiency.&quot;</p><p>Both procedures can be used in the same piece of music, but saying<br/>that one is a &quot;deficiency&quot; or &quot;lack of processing power&quot; I believe is<br/>inaccurate...</p><p>__________ ________ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
