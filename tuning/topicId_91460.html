Gene&apos;s<br/>come in to say that scales are the least important thing whereas I<br/>always explain them first.  And I think working with melody only is a<br/>good first exercise when you have a new temperament to learn.</p><p>You can also describe Miracle as a &quot;quartertone&quot; equivalent of<br/>Slendric (5&amp;21, formerly Wonder).  That would make sense if you were<br/>teaching Slendric first, which I can see making sense.  So the<br/>introduction might be something like &quot;Miracle divides the Slendric<br/>steps to give twice as many notes, and allows full 7-limit harmony, as<br/>well as opening the doors to the 11-limit&quot;.</p><p>You can describe Miracle as being a combination of Slendric, Mohajira<br/>(7&amp;31), and Marvel (225:224 planar).  Whether that&apos;s a practical way<br/>of teaching I don&apos;t know.</p><p>Here&apos;s a draft course outline for regular temperaments:</p><p>- Meantone, 5-limit harmony, spiral of fifths.<br/>- Schismatic, 7-limit harmony.<br/>- Mavila.<br/>- Slendric, generators that aren&apos;t fifths.<br/>- Gamelans, inharmonic timbres.<br/>- Pajara, periods that aren&apos;t octaves.<br/>- Mohajira, neutral thirds and seconds.<br/>- Magic, 9-limit harmony, Marvel?<br/>- Orwell, 11-limit harmony.<br/>- Miracle, 72-equal notation.<br/>- Overview of higher limits and other classes.</p><p>That would give 11 lessons, and I think it would be a good progression<br/>for music students who are going to understand fifths, notation,<br/>harmony, and whatever.  There are surely other ways to do it.</p><p>                 Graham</p></div><h3><a id=91510 href="#91510">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2010 10:31:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Caleb&gt;&quot; Miracle temperament divides the fifth into 6 equal steps.

From this you can deduce that taking a fifth up by 16/15 gives you an 8/5, and there is your approximation for 5.

Your issues with the given definitions of Miracle stem more from your unfamiliarity with the concept of regular temperaments than from anything else; if you had that one &quot;basic&quot; concept down, the given definitions would make a lot more sense.</p><p>This is why I believe that in teaching microtonality, jumping straight in to individual scales or temperaments is not the way to go.  People need to be given FIRST a basic understanding of what regular temperaments are, how they are designed and evaluated, how they can give structure to music (i.e. the sorts of scales they can produce), etc.  THEN, once those basics are understood, you can start looking at specific temperaments.  That way, you don&apos;t need to cram a summary of how regular temperaments work into the descriptions of each temperament.</p><p>Honestly, Caleb, knowing that Miracle temperaments produce 10-note scales of a given shape is really NOT the most useful thing to know about them (though knowing you need to have at least 10 notes of one to have a decent number of good triads might be more useful).  When you actually work with temperaments, probably the most useful thing to know is how many generators it takes to make a &quot;useful&quot; interval like a perfect fifth, a major third, or a 7/4 minor seventh.  This is actually MORE important than just knowing how many scale-steps the temperament produces at its various &quot;moments of symmetry&quot;.  For instance, Orwell temperament produces a moment of symmetry scale at 9 notes, but it only has two triads with a perfect fifth in that scale; this is because it takes several Orwell generators to get to a perfect fifth.  If you know how many generators it takes to produce various intervals, you can get a better idea of how many notes of the temperament you&apos;ll need to make music.</p><p>Of course, if you didn&apos;t know that you needed to know that about temperaments, you might THINK that knowing how many notes are in the scales produced by a temperament is most important.  This is why you have to understand the concept of &quot;mapping&quot; that is at the core of all regular temperaments: all temperaments &quot;map&quot; the same intervals (depending on the limit of the temperament, they will map the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, etc. harmonics, i.e. various prime harmonics) to some number of generators.  What varies between temperaments is how many generators the harmonics are mapped to.  In meantone or pythagorean temperament, the 3rd harmonic is mapped to 1 generator + 1 period (because the generator is a fifth, and the period is an octave).  In magic, the 5th harmonic is mapped to 1 generator plus 2 periods (because the generator is a pure-ish major third, and the period is an octave).</p><p>So basically, regular temperaments are for folks who are interested in using those harmonics as a musical basis, but prefer to use scales produced by series&apos; of generators (because these scales are more &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;even&quot; than JI and you don&apos;t have to go through the headache of multiplying and dividing ratios every time you move the tonic).  Of course, they&apos;re also for folks who just like the sound of them, but the preceding is basically the purpose for which they were designed.  If you understood this FIRST, then the thing you&apos;d want to see listed at the top of every temperament&apos;s description is how many generators and periods it takes to get to each harmonic, how well those harmonics are approximated at that point, and THEN what the generator is, and THEN how many notes you need in a scale of that temperament to use its &quot;good&quot; properties.  THEN you&apos;d probably want to look in to the cents values of some scales produced by that temperament, to see what other kinds of intervals appear in it.</p><p>Of course, if you&apos;re not too interested in approximating prime harmonics, regular temperaments might not be of much interest to you.  So if you knew that the concept of regular temperaments has &quot;approximating prime harmonics&quot; at its core, you&apos;d know not to waste your time reading about them.  If you&apos;d rather look at scales in terms of how many notes they have, and THEN pick them apart by what kind of harmonies they produce, you&apos;d be better served by looking at things like the Scale Tree and Moment-of-Symmetry scales in general.  Or maybe you&apos;d rather just see spreadsheets of various equal temperaments, the JI ratios they approximate (and how well they approximate them), and the various MOS scales possible in each temperament.  Either way, it&apos;s best to know the rationale behind the various ways of describing (and creating) scales, as well as the benefits they offer, before you dive in and start trying to learn about them.</p><p>HTH!</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=91513 href="#91513">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2010 10:54:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; You can also describe Miracle as a &quot;quartertone&quot; equivalent of<br/>&gt; Slendric (5&amp;21, formerly Wonder).

But if you ask for a good edo to tune valentine, you might equally well expect to hear &quot;77, 108 or 185&quot;. There&apos;s not much to be gained in tems of tuning accuracy by tempering out just 126/125 as opposed to both 126/125 and 1029/1024, which gives valentine. But if you take a 5-limit scale and temper it for starling, focusing on chains of minor thirds to let starling tempering have its full effect, and tune it using 185edo, you get a scale you can regard as in valentine temperament. But it will probably be a long, long way from being a MOS. Even myna temperament, with a minor third generator, will likely not give you a MOS. And yet, unless the scale is small (less than 12 notes, say) it is likely the 1029/1024 will also kick in, giving you authentic valentine tempering.</p></div><h3><a id=91518 href="#91518">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2010 2:24:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I would recommend that the course be labeled a course on Microtonal temperaments as opposed to microtones in general</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you don&apos;t know, now you know:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page">http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wikiversity is another Wikimedia resource, but this time, it aims to<br/>&gt; organize information in virtual online &quot;courses&quot; or &quot;lessons&quot; or what<br/>&gt; have you.

Your issues with the given definitions of Miracle stem more from your unfamiliarity with the concept of regular temperaments than from anything else; if you had that one &quot;basic&quot; concept down, the given definitions would make a lot more sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is why I believe that in teaching microtonality, jumping straight in to individual scales or temperaments is not the way to go. People need to be given FIRST a basic understanding of what regular temperaments are, how they are designed and evaluated, how they can give structure to music (i.e. the sorts of scales they can produce), etc. THEN, once those basics are understood, you can start looking at specific temperaments. That way, you don&apos;t need to cram a summary of how regular temperaments work into the descriptions of each temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Honestly, Caleb, knowing that Miracle temperaments produce 10-note scales of a given shape is really NOT the most useful thing to know about them (though knowing you need to have at least 10 notes of one to have a decent number of good triads might be more useful). When you actually work with temperaments, probably the most useful thing to know is how many generators it takes to make a &quot;useful&quot; interval like a perfect fifth, a major third, or a 7/4 minor seventh. This is actually MORE important than just knowing how many scale-steps the temperament produces at its various &quot;moments of symmetry&quot;. For instance, Orwell temperament produces a moment of symmetry scale at 9 notes, but it only has two triads with a perfect fifth in that scale; this is because it takes several Orwell generators to get to a perfect fifth. If you know how many generators it takes to produce various intervals, you can get a better idea of how many notes of the temperament you&apos;ll need to make music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, if you didn&apos;t know that you needed to know that about temperaments, you might THINK that knowing how many notes are in the scales produced by a temperament is most important. This is why you have to understand the concept of &quot;mapping&quot; that is at the core of all regular temperaments: all temperaments &quot;map&quot; the same intervals (depending on the limit of the temperament, they will map the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, etc. harmonics, i.e. various prime harmonics) to some number of generators. What varies between temperaments is how many generators the harmonics are mapped to. In meantone or pythagorean temperament, the 3rd harmonic is mapped to 1 generator + 1 period (because the generator is a fifth, and the period is an octave). In magic, the 5th harmonic is mapped to 1 generator plus 2 periods (because the generator is a pure-ish major third, and the period is an octave).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So basically, regular temperaments are for folks who are interested in using those harmonics as a musical basis, but prefer to use scales produced by series&apos; of generators (because these scales are more &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;even&quot; than JI and you don&apos;t have to go through the headache of multiplying and dividing ratios every time you move the tonic). Of course, they&apos;re also for folks who just like the sound of them, but the preceding is basically the purpose for which they were designed. If you understood this FIRST, then the thing you&apos;d want to see listed at the top of every temperament&apos;s description is how many generators and periods it takes to get to each harmonic, how well those harmonics are approximated at that point, and THEN what the generator is, and THEN how many notes you need in a scale of that temperament to use its &quot;good&quot; properties. THEN you&apos;d probably want to look in to the cents values of some scales produced by that temperament, to see what other kinds of intervals appear in it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, if you&apos;re not too interested in approximating prime harmonics, regular temperaments might not be of much interest to you. So if you knew that the concept of regular temperaments has &quot;approximating prime harmonics&quot; at its core, you&apos;d know not to waste your time reading about them. If you&apos;d rather look at scales in terms of how many notes they have, and THEN pick them apart by what kind of harmonies they produce, you&apos;d be better served by looking at things like the Scale Tree and Moment-of-Symmetry scales in general. Or maybe you&apos;d rather just see spreadsheets of various equal temperaments, the JI ratios they approximate (and how well they approximate them), and the various MOS scales possible in each temperament. Either way, it&apos;s best to know the rationale behind the various ways of describing (and creating) scales, as well as the benefits they offer, before you dive in and start trying to learn about them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; HTH!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Igs<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=91526 href="#91526">ðŸ”—</a>caleb morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2010 3:46:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ll be terse: no, twice, not trivial, just incomprehensible at first.</p><p>On Aug 3, 2010, at 1:29 PM, genewardsmith wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, caleb morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; **The point was that it gave a basic crucial bit of information first.**<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That is, a miracle temperament divides the 5th in 6 equal parts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That basic, crucial bit of information is closely related to the trivial, unimportant information that it uses an interval between 16/15 and 15/14 as an approximation to both, which you started this thread by objecting to.

You still need to know that three of these 8/7s give a fifth, but that will not surprise you if you look at what is between six 16/15 at 670 cents and six 15/14 at 717 cents, or note that three 8/7s is 693.5 cents. From this you can deduce that taking a fifth up by 16/15 gives you an 8/5, and there is your approximation for 5.

But of course, from the sound of Herman&apos;s posts about &quot;gold medal&quot; temperaments, temperaments are *usually* evaluated on how well they approximate the primes (and how complex they make them), not how well they do random ratios like 9/7, 11/6, or 13/5.  I&apos;m sure they *could* be looked at that way, but in discussion of regular temps, they never are.

For instance, instead of writing the<br/>&gt; 5-limit in terms of 2, 3 and 5, we can equally well write it in terms<br/>&gt; of 9/8, 10/9 and 16/15.</p><p>I&apos;ve considered alternatives, for instance, the superparticular intervals with primes in the numerator (i.e., 2/1, 3/2, 5/4, 7/6, 11/10), or ratios between adjacent primes (2, 3/2, 5/3, 7/5, 11/7). 7-limit temperaments could use 5/4, 6/5, 7/6, and 8/7, which has a certain appeal. Ultimately, I think that using smaller intervals in place of primes can have interesting and useful results, but the choice of which intervals to use and how to weight them is likely a matter of taste. You&apos;ll find the same temperaments whichever way you go, from what I&apos;ve found, but the &quot;badness&quot; evaluations may vary significantly.</p></div>
