But I should comment about your hints at where you<br/>might begin a response.  I&apos;m afraid this leads to something quite<br/>lengthy...</p><p>On 10 Apr 2001 <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:</p><p>Paul wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My problem with [Xenakis&apos; sieve theory] is that these constructions seem<br/>very contrived, not at<br/>&gt; all simple, and about as far from a &quot;derivation&quot; or &quot;explanation&quot; as you can<br/>&gt; get. Much more simple and powerful descriptions of scales, I feel, come from<br/>&gt; considering a few very basic considerations _including_ tuning, and if<br/>&gt; understood correctly, the inherent flexibility of the tuning will come out<br/>&gt; naturally.</p><p>In many ways, the &quot;diatonic&quot; is a measure against which all other scales,<br/>historical or synthetic or &quot;natural,&quot; must be measured.  Why?  The easy<br/>reason (and the one most likely to upset a lot of people since it is<br/>highly subjective) is that it is arguably the most successful scale,<br/>having been the basis for a plethora of great (I don&apos;t blush at this word)<br/>music.  But there is a deeper reason to use the diatonic as a measure.<br/>Many have noted that the diatonic is &quot;over-determined&quot; -- i.e., there are<br/>so many ways of generating it that you start to lose count.  One way is by<br/>stacking fifths until you get so close to an octave identity (at 7) that<br/>you can call it quits.  Then there&apos;s maximal evenness, in whatever form<br/>you wish to express it.  Then there are historical derivations based on<br/>writings of earlier theorists (making the assumption that they were<br/>significantly &quot;closer&quot; to the birth of diatony than we are -- not<br/>necessarily correct); tetrachord coupling (building from smaller<br/>constituent molecules); the logical sum of three diatonic triads whose<br/>roots are a fifth apart; etc.  Xenakis&apos; sieve theory is only one of the<br/>more recent &quot;derivations.&quot;</p><p>Now don&apos;t flinch at the word &quot;derivation&quot; here.  I don&apos;t in any way mean<br/>to suggest that the word implies &quot;this, and no other way, is how we got<br/>the diatonic.&quot;  *A* derivation is just that -- one way of constructing the<br/>object.  The amazing thing, and what has to make all scale-builders<br/>jealous (it does me!), is the over-determination: the fact that there is a<br/>multipicity of possible derivations, any one of which gets you to the<br/>same diatonic scale.  And this isn&apos;t an argument on behalf of the diatonic<br/>scale, since I personally believe that over-use demands that we give it a<br/>good long rest, while still keeping it as a model or measure for other<br/>configurations.  Instead of simply throwing out the diatonic, I&apos;d rather<br/>keep trying to surpass it, even if this is a futile effort.</p><p>So I&apos;m not defending Xenakis&apos; sieve theory as *the* way any given scale,<br/>historical or otherwise, came into being.  But I would defend Xenakis&apos;<br/>fruitful idea against charges that it is inelegant or contrived or not<br/>&quot;simple.&quot;  You have to understand that to make that charge is to call<br/>Peano&apos;s axiomatics of numbers (Xenakis&apos; basis) contrived or too complex to<br/>be useful.  While he doesn&apos;t state it so baldly, Xenakis&apos; various<br/>formulations can be reduced to this:</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;v(xm^yn)</p><p>where v is logical disjunction (&quot;or&quot;), ^ is conjunction (&quot;and&quot;), and xm<br/>and yn (which may be complemented) are &quot;residual classes&quot; m mod x and n<br/>mod y respectively (e.g., residual class 0 mod 4 is {0,4,8,...}, i.e., the<br/>augmented triad).  I&apos;m all for simplicity in its place, which means I<br/>believe only in those simple, elegant formulations which serve as a<br/>*basis* for complexity (which I generally equate with &quot;life&quot;).  When you<br/>put the above &quot;normal&quot; formulation into its most general form,<br/>v(xm^yn^...), there is hardly any scale you can&apos;t cover.  If, on the other<br/>hand, you start throwing things out when they get complex, there are a lot<br/>(most?) scales discussed on this list that you&apos;d have to throw out.  I<br/>prefer to keep *all* of them and reserve &quot;argument&quot; for the discussion of<br/>relative merits and demerits for specific compositional applications.<br/>But more importantly, Xenakis&apos; formulation suggests scales you may never<br/>have thought of without that formulation, i.e., it&apos;s a creativity trigger.</p><p>Are there &quot;more simple and powerful&quot; formulations than Xenakis&apos;?  Sure,<br/>DEPENDING on context.  But I know of no other that potentially covers so<br/>many (possibly all) scales.  And his use of the word &quot;sieve&quot; is<br/>(anthropologically) more suggestive than the generally used term<br/>&quot;background chromatic.&quot;  Why I say this leads to...</p><p>&gt; For example, set theory alone will never be able to explain why 7 notes and<br/>&gt; not some other number (you&apos;re not allowed to appeal to a 12-tone master set<br/>&gt; since that was constructed later in history).</p><p>As for &quot;why 7?&quot; you might want to look at ethnomusicologist Jay Rahn&apos;s<br/>&quot;Coordination of Interval Sizes in Seven-Tone Collections&quot; (JMT 35:1&amp;2) --<br/>there&apos;s a bit of set theory in there.  But let me take up the issue of<br/>what I am and am not allowed to appeal to.</p><p>Here I&apos;ll ask something that might seem incredibly naive (relating to my<br/>statement above re the birth of diatony): why do we believe that a<br/>&quot;background chromatic&quot; is a relatively modern invention?  Yes, if we look<br/>at this idea in the very limited ways available via surviving texts,<br/>Josquin probably did not think much in terms of a 12-tone master set or<br/>canvass.  But does this mean that neither he nor any other composer (or<br/>theorist) did not work with some sort of sieve, whether consciously or<br/>unconsciously?  What would happen if we assume that such a sieve was so<br/>deeply imbedded in certain important human activities by the time writing<br/>was invented, that it went either unnoticed or unremarked upon?  Assuming<br/>such a (subconscious?) sieve might explain a lot.  Now, since this puts us<br/>well outside the realm of conclusive historical evidence, let alone<br/>proofs, it&apos;s incumbant on me to make up a plausible story starting from:<br/>Where would a pre-historic chromatic sieve come from?  We&apos;ll start with<br/>something I assume we&apos;re all sitting on right now, something we rarely<br/>give notice to (unless it&apos;s missing): a piece of fabric.</p><p>Many have assumed that the art of weaving appeared some time in the<br/>neolithic, but archaeologists Olga Soffer and James Adovasio have recently<br/>discovered the remnant of a relatively complex weave that (along with<br/>other artifacts in a Moravian site) dates to 27,000 BC.  So we can safely<br/>assume (other examples confirm this as well) that weaving, in its simplest<br/>forms, dates even earlier -- probably much earlier.  Adovasio, a textile<br/>specialist (and discoverer of the Meadowcroft site near Pittsburgh that<br/>shattered previous theories dating arrival of homo sapiens in the Western<br/>hemisphere), believes that weaving was one of the most important<br/>&quot;discoveries&quot; of prehistoric peoples, not just for clothing, but for nets<br/>to trap animals as a food source -- a survival strategy every bit as<br/>important as making spearheads.  What does this have to do with music?</p><p>As an amateur weaver, I can tell you that, while warping a loom or doing<br/>the actual weaving, the weaver MUST keep hundreds if not thousands of<br/>threads straight.  To sit at a loom and go &quot;over 2, under 1, over 3, under<br/>2, over .....&quot; countless times with as little error as possible, there are<br/>only two ways I can think of.  One is to have a diagram or series of<br/>numbers for the pattern on a piece of paper in front of you and keep<br/>referring to it.  A lot of things argue against this approach: you start<br/>to go crosseyed, you lose your place, you get bored (vs the more positive<br/>&quot;meditation&quot; trance), and so on.  A much more efficient and natural way to<br/>keep weaving patterns straight is to &quot;sing&quot; or &quot;rhyme&quot; or &quot;dance&quot; the<br/>pattern as you weave.  It&apos;s much easier to sing &quot;dah da da dahhh dahhh da<br/>dah dah&quot; than to think/count &quot;2-1-1-3-3-1-2-2&quot; -- and the next row has to<br/>go &quot;da da dahhh dahhh da dah dah dah&quot; which is arguably an easier<br/>conceptual switch than &quot;1-1-3-3-1-2-2.&quot;  But the important thing to take<br/>away is that the &quot;tune&quot; or &quot;scale&quot; sung is the SAME THING as the<br/>arithmetic pattern.  When you sing the pattern quickly, your rendition is<br/>probably more rhythmic than melodious, but when you slow it down to weave,<br/>it helps the momory to put the various syllables at different pitch<br/>levels.</p><p>But pre-historic weavers didn&apos;t have the numbers even available for<br/>expressing any weaving patterns -- so they didn&apos;t have a choice.  Complex<br/>patterns appeared in weaving well before numbers were invented by kings<br/>and userers.  How would you go about teaching a child to weave (passing<br/>the technology along) if neither you nor the child had any concept of<br/>&quot;number&quot; of threads? -- You&apos;d gesture &quot;watch and listen&quot; and then sing out<br/>loud as you weave.</p><p>A weaver&apos;s &quot;work song&quot; isn&apos;t simply a way to make a boring job more<br/>pleasant, it&apos;s actually necessary, in some form, to do the job itself for<br/>anything more complex than a simple plain (over-under/mom&apos;s potholder)<br/>weave; and we know that these weavers did go beyond plain weave for a<br/>variety of utilitarian, and possibly aesthetic, reasons (and artifacts<br/>show this).</p><p>But the main point here is that, IF a connection could somehow be<br/>established between early weaving patterns and musical scale patterns<br/>(including drumming patterns), it would concomitantly suggest that there<br/>is a (subconscious?) background &quot;chromatic&quot; for related melodies,<br/>rhythms, scales, ragas, formulas -- you simply can&apos;t weave without the<br/>textile version of such a chromatic canvas, whether you&apos;re consciously<br/>aware of it or not.  And the repetitive nature of weaving would tend to<br/>culturally instantiate a lot of musical patterns WELL before any Greek<br/>thought of scientifically measuring ratios on a monochord.  QED;-)</p><p>Now what patterns might show up (no one that I know of has looked yet, but<br/>I&apos;m beginning to ask around) that could make a pre-historic weaving-music<br/>connection?  You might want to look for fabric relics that showed a<br/>2212221 pattern -- after all, this shows up in some African rhythmic<br/>patterns as well as our diatonic suggesting some deeply imbedded roots<br/>(musicologists are loath to admit to a mixing of pitch and rhythm patterns<br/>-- but weave patterns jwould get around this objection); or perhaps a<br/>pentatonic 23223 (actually weaving either of these patterns would produce<br/>a kind of twill).  But chances are it wouldn&apos;t be this easy or direct, and<br/>you&apos;d have to end up guessing from much flimsier evidence.  E.g., you<br/>could easily identify shorter weaving patterns such as 21 or 221 and<br/>surmise that repetition of 21 resulted in octatonic patterns and 221 got<br/>variously developed as a basic tetrachord.  As flimsy as that might be,<br/>for my money it makes just as much sense as theories that posit ratios or<br/>overtones as a basis which, when you accept them as PART of the whole<br/>story as well (rather than going with either/or arguments), might point to<br/>another over-determination for certain more general patterns.</p><p>Finally, transmission of musical patterns between radically different<br/>cultures.  If a pre-historic traveler migrated to a distant land for<br/>whatever reason, he (she) might bring his songs with him in his head.<br/>But perhaps someone kills him before he gets to sing them.  His killer,<br/>never having seen the kind of garment worn by his victim, takes the fabric<br/>home.  He wants to make one like it for himself so he examines the weave.<br/>At his primitive warp-weighted loom, without ever having heard his victim<br/>sing, he begins to weave the stranger&apos;s music.</p><p>Pleasant dreams!</p><p>Steve Soderberg</p></div><h3><a id=20867 href="#20867">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.
