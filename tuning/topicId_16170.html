Carey was a student of John Clough in Buffalo.</p><p>Carey, Norman, A. &quot;Distribution Modulo 1 and Musical Scales&quot;</p><p>AUTHOR: Carey, Norman, A<br/>TITLE: Distribution Modulo 1 and Musical Scales<br/>INSTITUTION: University of Rochester<br/>BEGUN: July 1996<br/>COMPLETED: February 1998<br/>ABSTRACT:<br/>This dissertation examines the relationships between the mathematics of<br/>distribution modulo 1 and the theory of well-formed scales. Distribution<br/>modulo 1 concerns the distribution of real numbers between 0 and 1. In<br/>particular, finite sets of real numbers have been studied with respect<br/>to the Steinhaus Conjecture, proven by S&iuml;&iquest;&half;s and others. Well-formed<br/>scales, first introduced in Carey and Clampitt 1989, are generated by<br/>iterations of a given musical interval modulo the octave, the standard<br/>musical interval of periodicity.</p><p>An introductory survey of ten scale theorists provides a context in<br/>which to understand the properties of the well-formed scale. A scale is<br/>well-formed if each generic interval comes in two specific sizes, or if<br/>it consists of equal step intervals. The structure of the well-formed<br/>scale is a function of the continued fraction representing the log ratio<br/>of the generator (&quot;fifth&quot;) and the interval of periodicity (&quot;octave&quot;).<br/>The diatonic scale in Pythagorean tuning<br/>serves as the prototype: the generator is the overtone fifth (3:2) and<br/>the interval of periodicity is the octave (2:1). The diatonic is a<br/>member of an infinite hierarchy of well-formed scales, recursively<br/>generated by the continued fraction of Log 2 (3/2). This hierarchy also<br/>includes the pentatonic and chromatic collections. In general, the<br/>well-formed scale belongs to a hierarchy determined by the continued<br/>fraction of, Log I (G), where I is the frequency ratio of the interval<br/>of periodicity and G is the frequency ratio of the generator. Five<br/>theorems are presented that characterize well-formed scales, their<br/>hierarchies, and the patterns of step intervals they exhibit. The step<br/>patterns themselves form the basis for a secondary system of well-formed<br/>scale classification. The<br/>conditions on &quot;coherence&quot; for well-formed scales are fully<br/>characterized. Also discussed are applications and extensions of the<br/>theory, including tuning theory, rhythmic analysis, and composition.</p><p>KEYWORDS:<br/>scale theory, well-formed, maximally even, Myhill&apos;s Property, diatonic,<br/>coherence, microtonal, rhythm, distribution modulo 1, continued<br/>fractions</p><p>TOC:<br/>I Diatonic Theory</p><p>              A Introduction<br/>              B Foundational and Structural Properties<br/>              C Definitions<br/>              D Diatonic Theory - Antecedents<br/>              E Three Diatonic Theories</p><p>II Well-formed Scales</p><p>              A Diatonic Theory and Well-formed Scales<br/>              B The Theory of Well-formed Scales</p><p>III Five Theorems Concerning Well-formed Scales</p><p>              A Introduction<br/>              B Distribution Modulo 1: The Three-Gap Theorem<br/>              C Well-formed Scales and the Multiplicative Permutation<br/>              D Symmetry and Closure<br/>              E Well-formed Scales and Myhill&apos;s Property<br/>              F The Well-formed Scale Sequence<br/>              G Generic Ordering (&quot;Coherence&quot;)</p><p>IV Applications and Extensions</p><p>              A Microtonalism and Well-formed Scales<br/>              B Rhythm and Well-formedness<br/>              C Diatonic Theory and Compostion<br/>              D Conclusion and Prospects</p><p>CONTACT:<br/>Eastman School of Music<br/><a href="mailto:nac@theory.esm.rochester.edu">nac@theory.esm.rochester.edu</a></p></div>
