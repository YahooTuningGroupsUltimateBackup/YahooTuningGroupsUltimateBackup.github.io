First MIDI note number to retune:<br/>0</p><p>Definitely not middle C (60).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. MIDI Note Number 69 is tuned to 440 instead of 890.32258, all other<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No both. 440 Hertz is the absolute frequency and 890.32258 the<br/>&gt; interval in cents relative to 1/1.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry, Manuel, but I&apos;m struggling to understand the concepts of<br/>Reference Note and Frequency To Tune Reference Note.  It could be that<br/>I have been confusing Hz and cent units.  Once again, if I match up<br/>the .kbm file below:</p><p>! Size of map (greater than or equal to the number of notes in the scale<br/>! to be mapped). The pattern repeats every so many keys:<br/>12<br/>! First MIDI note number to retune:<br/>0<br/>! Last MIDI note number to retune:<br/>127<br/>! Middle note where scale degree 0 is mapped to:<br/>60<br/>! Reference note for which frequency is given:<br/>69<br/>! Frequency to tune the above note to (floating point e.g. 440.0):<br/>440.0<br/>! Scale degree to consider as formal octave (determines difference in<br/>pitch<br/>! between adjacent mapping patterns):<br/>12<br/>! Mapping.<br/>! The numbers represent scale degrees mapped to keys. The first degree<br/>is for<br/>! the given middle note, the next for subsequent higher keys.<br/>! For an unmapped key, put in an &quot;x&quot;.

The<br/>&gt; &gt; developer has been creating tuned patches that include the DX piano<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah, then it shouldn&apos;t be a surprise it will sound strange if the<br/>&gt; tuning differs much from 12-tET. Don&apos;t know if this synth allows a<br/>&gt; workaround.</p><p>The G2 has more in common with Max/MSP, Pd, Reaktor, etc. than typical<br/>hardware synths.  Ian&apos;s tuning method involves multiplexing logic<br/>signals into virtual Control Step Sequencer modules that determine<br/>step order by incoming signal value rather than by clock signal.  That<br/>is, if regular sequencer modules are like arrays in that you must step<br/>through them to find a value, this type of Control Sequencer Module is<br/>more like a hashtable.  The output of Ian&apos;s tuning block then sets the<br/>pitch values of oscillators.  The G2 oscillators have fine tuning<br/>settings in terms of cents or Hz.</p><p>Tuning on the G2 works fine for 12-note/octave tunings.  It should<br/>work for any synth patch that does not do physical modeling or employs<br/>secondary oscillators that are pitch-shifting (eg. the one-finger M7<br/>chord sound used in techno).  More extreme tunings do not sound right,<br/>but that&apos;s because of some bugs.  Ian says he put in a fix for the<br/>96TET bug I discovered, but I have yet to test it.</p><p>Paolo</p></div><h3><a id=70997 href="#70997">ðŸ”—</a>Joe &#x3C;tamahome02000@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/6/2007 11:00:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I believe that&apos;s all correct.
