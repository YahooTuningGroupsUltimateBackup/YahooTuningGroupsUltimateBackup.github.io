One plays the ten note mode from the black keys<br/>and plays tetrads from the white keys - it is in the<br/>drop list of presets for Views | Midi Keyboard retuning.</p><p>The other plays the mode from the top two rows of a pc kkbd<br/>and the tetrads from the bottom two rows nad is in the new<br/>View | Mouse and PC Keyboard music window presets.</p><p>The way it works is that it is actually setto play<br/>1/1/ 5/4 3/2 7/4- but adjusts the pitches of the notes<br/>to the nearest notes in the current mode (arpeggio).</p><p>You choose what pitches to play there and what instruments<br/>to use for each from Voices | Custom Voices | Edit Custom<br/>Melodic Voice - so one can do inversions or whatever one<br/>pleases and you can have different instruments for each<br/>of the notes in the chord.</p><p>Works with the sustain pedal too, and pitch bending so<br/>you can pitch bend the entire chord up and down after you<br/>play it.</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/whats_new.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/whats_new.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/fts_download.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/fts_download.htm</a></p><p>The one with tetrads from the white keys<br/>has two duplicated tetrads of course<br/>for B C and E F. - here I am referring to the keys<br/>the player plays on the keyboard and not the<br/>pitches that get suonded.</p><p>I wonder if there is any nice<br/>chord that one could have that would be a sensible<br/>thing to play for one each of those notes<br/>(some kind of diminished seventh perhaps or<br/>something??)</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=50641 href="#50641">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/2003 9:51:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; The one with tetrads from the white keys<br/>&gt; has two duplicated tetrads of course<br/>&gt; for B C and E F. - here I am referring to the keys<br/>&gt; the player plays on the keyboard and not the<br/>&gt; pitches that get suonded.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder if there is any nice<br/>&gt; chord that one could have that would be a sensible<br/>&gt; thing to play for one each of those notes<br/>&gt; (some kind of diminished seventh perhaps or<br/>&gt; something??)</p><p>Perhaps these should correspond to the dissonant major-minor and<br/>minor-major tetrads but with one pitch of each altered so that they<br/>become consonant major or minor tetrads. Unfortunately, there isn&apos;t<br/>just one unique way of doing this, but several.</p></div>
