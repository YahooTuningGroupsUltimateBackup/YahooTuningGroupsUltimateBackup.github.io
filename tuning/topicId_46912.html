Pretty funny that I find your recent posts pulling me back in!</p><p>(I won&apos;t even bother to reply to the long &apos;string-of-consciousness&apos; about your compositional path - very eloquent, and nice to see someone speaking to these inner issues. Heartening, actually.)</p><p>&gt; It seems we all tend to be a bit right-brained talking about the<br/>&gt; math of this, that, and the other tuning or temperament.</p><p>Ya think? :)</p><p>&gt; What is the one tuning whose beauty and utility you can&apos;t live<br/>&gt; without?</p><p>All of them.</p><p>And I mean that. Not facetiously at all.</p><p>Because if *I* singled out tunings, there is not only the perjorative place on the &apos;other&apos; tunings (if nowhere else than in my mind, which would cloud my judgement when listening to other&apos;s musics) but the fact that At This Point I don&apos;t know what tunings might fit the next piece of music that floats into my head.</p><p>All that said, something has been on my mind ever since you posted &quot;The Juggler&quot; (not to mention the great Weather Report tune &quot;Juggler&quot;): the inventiveness, craft, attention to compositional detail, and overall form of your piece got me past my usual non-interest in 19tet. And 19 isn&apos;t alone in this.</p><p>Does this mean that your piece, or a piece like it could win me over *in spite of a tuning*? In all honesty, quite probably. Because if one is focussing primarily on the tuning, they are placing the music secondarily.</p><p>I came at microtonality in both the front door and the back door (sorry for those of you that know this already): before I had ever heard about microtonality (whatever that meant), I walked through a door (literally) into a room full of the instruments built by Harry Partch, and spent the next 15 year performing his music. And never *once* did I really stop to think *about* the tuning - it was simply the raw ingredient that formed part of the aesthetic.</p><p>And while a 43-note diamond (yes, Paul, 41) fashioned out of Just Intonation is indeed a bona fide Tuning Entity, it never seemed out of place, it never seemed &apos;forced onto&apos; the music, it - for crying out loud - never seemed Weird. And this is the very reaction that came from each and every audience. They DID NOT come up to discuss the finer points of vanishing commas, or untonality vs. otonality as it related to the natural world.</p><p>It was simply a language as a vehicle that worked for one composer, who utilized the strengths (and the weaknesses) to create a body of work, aided by a family of instruments, some of whom couldn&apos;t give a flying fuck about inharmonicity vs. purity. Bastard children, those.</p><p>Could someone do this in another tuning? Could someone do this in ANY tuning? I don&apos;t really know. But that is for *them* to find out, and I hope that they realize that the tuning isn&apos;t THE decision to make when making a piece, it is only ONE of the decisions. This is what I keep in mind during my tuning explorations - and I admit publically that I still feel completely like a babe at this point, and thank the gods, Intel, and talented programmers that I am finally able to work on my own system and explore the world of tunings.</p><p>And I&apos;ll narrow it down, I&apos;m sure. No doubt. I still don&apos;t know why some tunings just make me want to run away (screaming, usually), and some are as intoxicating as a [insert intoxicating, preferably exotic, analogy here].</p><p>So much for *my* stream-of-consciousness. Which is more like a creek, really. Or trickle.</p><p>It *is* Southern California, you know...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=46931 href="#46931">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/2003 8:47:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;akj@r...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_46912.html#46912">/tuning/topicId_46912.html#46912</a></p><p>&gt; Hello All,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just wanted to stir things up here a little, and ask a<br/>question.....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems we all tend to be a bit right-brained talking about the<br/>math of this, that,<br/>&gt; and the other tuning or temperament.

Since I perform<br/>&gt; and direct<br/>&gt; &gt;Partch&apos;s music internationally, I do know the answer to this<br/>&gt; question.  Only<br/>&gt; &gt;problem: there is no proper reception on the other side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Either you can give the answer or you cannot. If you can, either you<br/>&gt; are willing to or not willing. To say you have the answer but are not<br/>&gt; willing to give it to people so inferior to you as the members of<br/>&gt; this group is an appallingly arrogant stance.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I have written on this issue many times.

You are saying it is self-evident that &quot;the<br/>&gt; greatest musicians&quot; can hear distinctions of X cents, but without<br/>&gt; giving a value to X. This isn&apos;t even a claim, it is simply another<br/>&gt; way of saying you haven&apos;t a clue, and are willing to deal in manifest<br/>&gt; absurdity.</p><p>This reminds me of an episode of the old Tom Snyder television show, when his<br/>guest was Yitzchak Perlman.  Tom, in beautiful honesty, asked &quot;how can you<br/>possiblty find all those notes on the violin...there are no markings at all!&quot;<br/>Now, how could he answer this to poor old Tom?

If you want to say, specifically, what you think<br/>&gt; &gt;can be acomplished, I am interested. If you want to claim some<br/>&gt; people<br/>&gt; &gt;have the magic power to hear the difference between any two<br/>&gt; intervals,<br/>&gt; &gt;no matter how close--be the difference a cent, 0.001 cents, or<br/>&gt; &gt;10^(-100) cents, then I&apos;m not willing to follow the conversation<br/>&gt; into<br/>&gt; &gt;the realm of fantasy.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Johnny: If life experience is reduced to fantasy, than I feel all<br/>&gt; the more<br/>&gt; &gt;that it was important to state my opinions forthrightly at this<br/>&gt; time, rather<br/>&gt; &gt;than watch the List continue on its anorexic path.  Would you<br/>&gt; rather make this an<br/>&gt; &gt;advanced theory list and be done with the peskhy musicians?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This kind of bullshit is not an answer. Can you give one? Do you, or<br/>&gt; do you not claim to be able to distingish 10^(-100) cents of<br/>&gt; difference, using life experience or anything else?<br/>&gt;</p><p>I hear 1 cent discreetly, and I can vocalize it, as well.  In JI, where no<br/>beats are the intention, I&apos;m sure there is even greater accuracy.  I have left<br/>this discussion after repeatedly stating it is not proveable over this List.<br/>It is only those people that have never met me that have any problem with<br/>this.

It also helps to give a direct answer to a<br/>direct question, and here is the answer to yours:</p><p>&quot;Hemiennealimmal&quot; refers to an 11-limit linear temperament. However,<br/>just as meantone can be considered, more or less, an aspect of<br/>31-equal, hemiennealimmal in practice could be taken to be a<br/>temperament which has generators of 1/18th of an octave (or 34<br/>&quot;shismas&quot;, or steps of 612) and of 7 shismas. The maximum error<br/>representing any 11-limit consonance is about 1/3 of a cent, so it is<br/>a temperament of the &quot;zeroth magnitude&quot;, meaning with maximum error<br/>between 1/4 and 1/2 cent.</p><p>My claim is not that a difference from an 11-limit JI ratio of 1/3<br/>cent can never be heard under any circumstances, but that it is<br/>unlikely anyone could hear it in an actual performance of Partch&apos;s<br/>music. This is very differnt than saying the same thing about a 72-et<br/>performance, which would be third magnitude. You might note that the<br/>purely 5-limit harmonies would have an error of at most 1/22 of a<br/>cent, and the purely 9-limt harmonies of 1/5 cent.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hear 1 cent discreetly, and I can vocalize it, as well.</p><p>What about 1/3 cent? Can you hear, in actual performance, that an<br/>interval of 11/8 or 11/9 is flat by 1/3 cent?</p><p> In JI, where no<br/>&gt; beats are the intention, I&apos;m sure there is even greater accuracy.</p><p>How well are you going to be able to use beats, during a performance<br/>of Partch&apos;s music, to determine that something is off from 11/9 by a<br/>third of a cent?</p><p>  I have left<br/>&gt; this discussion after repeatedly stating it is not proveable over<br/>this List.<br/>&gt; It is only those people that have never met me that have any problem<br/>with<br/>&gt; this.  Hence some frustration.</p><p>I wasn&apos;t asking you to prove anything; I haven&apos;t been a party to that<br/>conversation. I will ask that you treat me with more respect that you did.</p></div><h3><a id=47051 href="#47051">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2003 3:19:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_46912.html#47042">/tuning/topicId_46912.html#47042</a></p><p>&gt; oh, OK, now i understand what you meant.  that is indeed<br/>&gt; a case of extended reference ... but no, in the particular<br/>&gt; case i&apos;m talking about (the climactic D#-minor chord from<br/>&gt; my piece _3 Plus 4_), i didn&apos;t have the major-7th in mind<br/>&gt; at all.  i simply wanted a plain old minor triad with a<br/>&gt; &quot;dark&quot; (i.e., narrow) minor-3rd of around 275 cents,<br/>&gt; and 75/64 fit perfectly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i had tried all three of the others, and none of them<br/>&gt; gave me the sound that i wanted.  what i found very<br/>&gt; surprising was that my second choice was 19/16 (~297.5 cents)<br/>&gt; which is much farther away from 75/64 than 7/6 (~267 cents).<br/>&gt; even tho 7/6 was closer, it didn&apos;t have the right sound<br/>&gt; to me, and 19/16 worked much better.  but 75/64 was perfect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -monz</p><p>***In your analysis, Monz, did the larger ratio 75/64 possibly *make*<br/>smaller ratios in the surrounding JI texture??</p><p>J.

(i wish i had written down exactly<br/>what it was in dodekamus ... oh well...)  75:64 was the ratio<br/>that jumped out and bit me when i saw that, so i set the<br/>tuning to that and have been happy ever since.   :)</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=47072 href="#47072">ðŸ”—</a>czhang23@aol.com</h3><span>9/18/2003 2:43:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: &quot;akjmicro&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:akj@rcn.com">akj@rcn.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: The beauty question...</p><p>In a message dated 2003:09:17 05:53:17 PM, Aaron quotes Fran&ccedil;ois Laferri&egrave;re &amp;<br/>writes:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Save the tuning bio-diversity!<br/> [ . . . ]<br/>&gt;I like this reply&apos;s sentiment.</p><p>    LOL.

We know that 5:6 and 6:7 were no good. I<br/>suggested that what you wanted (and found) was the plateau of maximum<br/>entropy or maximum complexity _between_ the notch-like valleys of<br/>consonance at 5:6 and 6:7. I said the noble mediant is about 284 cents<br/>and Paul said his (s=1%) entropy curve agreed with that, with the<br/>highest point at about 285 cents. But Paul thought that you found 285<br/>cents would be too wide. However, I don&apos;t think so because you found<br/>that 19/16 wasn&apos;t too bad (at 297 c).</p><p>And Paul pointed out that we would also need to consider the &quot;major<br/>third&quot; in that chord, and see if maybe you were simultaneously<br/>maximising _its_ entropy too. The theory I&apos;m playing with here is that<br/>maybe this is a kind of &quot;anti-JI&quot; third, not meaningfully represented<br/>by any particular ratio.</p><p>Whether we attempt to simultaneously maximise the entropy of the two<br/>thirds, or put it equidistant from the two noble mediants, we get<br/>pretty much the same answer. 282 c + 420 c. This puts us a little<br/>closer to your 275 c, and we don&apos;t expect it to sound very different a<br/>few cents either way. It isn&apos;t like a JI interval where you can hear<br/>the beats stop, because what we have here is maximum beat rates (too<br/>fast to be perceived as beats, but rather as &quot;roughness&quot;, or perhaps<br/>what you described as &quot;darkness&quot;.)</p><p>But in case Johnny&apos;s reading this I&apos;d better make it clear that I have<br/>no doubt that your ear found just the right third at around 275 c, and<br/>it&apos;s the theory that is not yet sufficiently refined here. :-)</p></div><h3><a id=47077 href="#47077">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@aya.yale.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2003 3:44:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It isn&apos;t like a JI interval where you can hear<br/>&gt; the beats stop, because what we have here is maximum beat rates</p><p>well, of course there&apos;s no way to really make that precise, but for<br/>the two beat rates that are zero at the two nearby just ratios,<br/>wouldn&apos;t the &quot;maximin&quot; be at the usual mediant, 11:13 = 289 cents?</p><p>anyway, i took a look at where the local maximum in the vicinity was<br/>for my more recent harmonic entropy calculations (based on<br/>a &apos;tenney&apos;, rather than farey, series &quot;seeding&quot;):</p><p>s=1.5% -- none; no local minimum at 6:7<br/>s=1.2% -- 282 cents<br/>s=1% -- 288 cents<br/>s=0.6% -- 292 cents<br/>s=0.3% -- 280 cents and 304 cents; new local minimum at 11:13</p><p>so first of all, since the farey series based harmonic entropy curves<br/>have an overall downward slope, it appears that rectifying this slope<br/>is enough to shift the local maximum by a few cents (since it&apos;s a<br/>rounded, not pointy, maximum), from ~285 to 288. secondly, depending<br/>on the hearing resolution you assume (in real life this is affected<br/>by timbre, register, loudness, duration, and the specific listener<br/>involved), the local maximum can vary at least from 282 to 292 cents,<br/>even if you&apos;re sure that you hear local minima at 6:7 and 5:6 and<br/>nowhere in-between.</p><p>just wanted to dispel any notions that there&apos;s a &quot;point of maximum<br/>dissonance&quot; between 6:7 and 5:6 that can be pinned down to within a<br/>couple of cents, either theoretically or by ear.</p></div><h3><a id=47083 href="#47083">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2003 8:37:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;perlich@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;d.keenan@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It isn&apos;t like a JI interval where you can hear<br/>&gt; &gt; the beats stop, because what we have here is maximum beat rates<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; well, of course there&apos;s no way to really make that precise, but for<br/>&gt; the two beat rates that are zero at the two nearby just ratios,<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t the &quot;maximin&quot; be at the usual mediant, 11:13 = 289 cents?</p><p>Probably, but those are not the only beat rates involved.
