It forces<br/>&gt; the reader to understand the 5-limit lattice _a priori_ and<br/>&gt; to calculate all other prime-factor adjustments thru a 2-step<br/>&gt; process in relation to the 5-limit lattice.</p><p>Hey, it&apos;s another notation holy war! Yippeee!!</p><p>&gt; Wolf and I both propose modifications of Johnston&apos;s ideas<br/>&gt; which utilize the linear 3-limit (Pythagorean) tuning as<br/>&gt; the _a priori_ basis, since &apos;standard&apos; notation developed<br/>&gt; on that basis anyway: each distinctive letter-name and all<br/>&gt; of the associated (and multiple) sharps and flats by themselves<br/>&gt; clearly indicate an extended Pythagorean system.  Use of prime-<br/>&gt; factor 5 is indicated by further accidentals (which are also<br/>&gt; required by Johnston anyway), and the other primes follow in<br/>&gt; a similar manner.</p><p>I&apos;ve devised a subtly different system, which combines certain aspects of<br/>both the others.  Some clues at <a href="http://x31eq.com/schismic.htm">http://x31eq.com/schismic.htm</a> .<br/> It also has a linear 3-limit-ish basis, but places the wolf in an<br/>unexpected place, so the white notes are (or could be) almost the same<br/>places as in Johnston&apos;s notation.</p><p>The idea is to take 12 notes, fix them, and write them as you would<br/>anyway.  In addition, the # and b symbols have consistent meanings, so you<br/>could get by with only remembering 7 notes plus the sharpness.  Then, add<br/>a &quot;comma shift&quot; symbol, and use schismic approximations.</p><p>&gt; These systems have the big advantage of requiring _a priori_<br/>&gt; systemic knowledge only of the linear Pythagorean system: any<br/>&gt; pitch can be calculated by its relation to the Pythagorean tuning,<br/>&gt; which in turn can also be calculated from 1/1 by knowledge of the<br/>&gt; simple &apos;rules&apos; of the generating cycle of 4ths/5ths and the<br/>&gt; letter-names and sharps/flats.</p><p>Your system requires:</p><p>tonic pitch           1<br/>size of fifth         1<br/>four modifiers        4</p><p>That makes 6 free variables.  Mine requires</p><p>7 pitches             7<br/>2 modifiers           2</p><p>which is 9 free parameters.  So 50% more complex.  Although it could also<br/>be</p><p>tonic pitch            1<br/>size of fifth          1<br/>one modifier           1</p><p>which is 3 free parameters, so only half as complex as yours.  It all<br/>depends on what we expect the performer to work out.  I expect they&apos;ll<br/>remember those 7 pitches either way.  They could even be built in to the<br/>instrument somehow.</p><p>The advantages of my system are that there&apos;s only one new modifier to<br/>remember, and you don&apos;t have to remember whether G# is supposed to be<br/>higher or lower than Ab.  Also, a diatonic scale on the white notes can be<br/>written with the minimum number of modifiers (I expect the key signature<br/>will usually override this default).</p><p>It also means that it isn&apos;t too drastic if the performer assumes the<br/>original scale is 12-equal, and has a good ear for 5-limit chords, because<br/>it&apos;s sufficiently vague to start with.  For performers without a good ear,<br/>there will be a problem with precision -- you can only nail the 11-limit<br/>to within about 10 cents.  This improves with lower limits: 5-limit can be<br/>considered JI.</p><p>72-equal notation could work in a similar way.  Different symbols for<br/>commas and quartertones would be useful.  That&apos;s all been discussed before<br/>as well.</p><p>&gt; Henry, you might want to try to talk this composer into letting<br/>&gt; you copy his score using one of these notation systems instead.<br/>&gt; In my opinion, it would ultimately encourage more performances,<br/>&gt; even tho at the present time I must admit that certainly more<br/>&gt; performers are familiar with Johnston&apos;s notation than with mine<br/>&gt; or Wolf&apos;s.</p><p>Well, nobody will be at all familiar with my system.  In fact, nobody<br/>seems to like it.  Even I prefer meantone notation, when I actually write<br/>anything down.  It&apos;s about the same in the 11-limit, anyway.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps the only way to make a microtonal notation more &apos;natural&apos;<br/>&gt; is to show its pitches&apos;s adjustments in relation to 12-tET,<br/>&gt; because that&apos;s the scale with which everyone is familiar,<br/>&gt; and because the accursed hardware and software designers insist<br/>&gt; on building it into every instrument and program they create.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But it&apos;s very difficult to indicate JI tunings *systematically*<br/>&gt; in relation to 12-tET, because of the inherent differences<br/>&gt; between ETs (which are closed systems) and JI (which are open,<br/>&gt; i.e., potentially infinite).</p><p>That&apos;s where the 72= notation would come in handy.  It&apos;s 11-limit<br/>consistent, and can be replaced with cents deviations, even if they won&apos;t<br/>be accurate to the JI.  As has been discussed before.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=15275 href="#15275">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Essentially this is pretty close, anyway,<br/>to 12-tET, since 12-tET is fundamentally derived from it... so Paul<br/>suggests why not &quot;go with the flow&quot; and actually use 12-tET as the<br/>basis.

HIS basis is 5-limit and he makes alterations from there.</p><p>But then what is his chromatic scale??  Where does it come from,<br/>piling up just thirds??  Must be (??)

I have opted for a system in which I use symbols to<br/>indicate *approximate* deviations from 12TET. Though the latest of these<br/>pieces hasn&apos;t been performed yet, it is my belief that it will be a<br/>practical way for performing musicians to approach a score like this with a<br/>minimum of special training in notation. Here are the symbols I use:</p><p>+/-                        slightly sharp/flat -- deviation by about a 12th<br/>tone<br/>up arrow/down arrow        rather sharp/flat -- deviation by about a sixth tone<br/>half sharp/backwards flat  about a quarter-tone sharp/flat<br/>#/b (conventional flat and sharp) about a semitone</p><p>These can be combined, usually the +/- or arrows with conventional flats or<br/>sharps. This gives me the same number of pitches as 72TET, though in JI. I<br/>don&apos;t need a precise notation (like Johnston&apos;s or Wolf&apos;s or Monzo&apos;s)<br/>because the players are usually tuning to a reference pitch sounding in the<br/>computer accompaniment. They just need to know where approximately they<br/>need to aim for in relation to the pitches they&apos;re used to playing. Because<br/>of the consistency of 72TET in relation to JI, the approximation is usually<br/>good to within a few cents.</p><p>Bill</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/>^ Bill Alves                                      email: <a href="mailto:alves@hmc.edu">alves@hmc.edu</a> ^<br/>^ Harvey Mudd College                 URL: <a href="http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/">http://www2.hmc.edu/~alves/</a> ^<br/>^ 301 E.

Monz, when did you learn Greek??  As<br/>&gt; preparation for this study??  The whole thing is incredibly<br/>&gt; impressive, and, I must confess, I have not studied the entire<br/>&gt; yet... just some of it.</p><p>Thanks very much for the compliments, Joe.  About this same<br/>paper, I was honored by what I consider the greatest compliment<br/>anyone&apos;s ever given me about my work: John Chalmers (of all<br/>people) said: &apos;your scholarship is breathtaking&apos;.</p><p>In fact, I learned Greek *while* working on this paper... wanting<br/>to translate Aristoxenus *literally* into English was the catalyst.<br/>I can&apos;t really say I did actually study or learn Greek... I just<br/>figured out enough of it to translate these passages.  (And,<br/>I hasten to add, John helped me over some of the rough spots.)</p><p>And please keep in mind that this paper is *very* sloppy as<br/>it stands right now, and is also missing my latest interpretation<br/>of Aristoxenus&apos;s tetrachord divisions, which I consider to be a<br/>real breakthru.  So it&apos;s probably less than 1/2 developed so far,<br/>definitely still in the incubation stages.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; May I be forgiven, though, if I found the following paragraph<br/>&gt; rather humorous (??):<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Litchfield 1988, p 64-65]<br/>&gt;      The crux of this proof is whether the fifth is a full perfect<br/>&gt; &gt; fifth. In concept, there is no reason to admit this interval as<br/>&gt; &gt; anything but a fifth; in practice, however, it does not sound<br/>&gt; &gt; like a fifth. Had Aristoxenus performed this proof, the would<br/>&gt; &gt; surely have heard the discrepancy, as would any other musicician<br/>&gt; &gt; used to manipulationg the monochord. Nevertheless, the<br/>&gt; &gt; discrepancy between theory and practice appears not to have<br/>&gt; &gt; bothered Aristoxenus. He changed nothing in his treatise<br/>&gt; &gt; because of it. ... Thus, the concept alone must have been<br/>&gt; &gt; Aristoxenus&apos;s concern, and he appears not as an empiricist<br/>&gt; &gt; but as an conceptualist or conceptual idealist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps he was one of our first &quot;conceptual artists??&quot;</p><p>Yes, Joe, I can see why you find it humorous.  But seriously,<br/>I would say that&apos;s not too far off the mark of the conclusion<br/>Litchfield reached.  Litchfield would certainly call Aristoxenus<br/>a &apos;conceptual theorist&apos;, even if &apos;artist&apos; is pushing it a bit.<br/>(We only have his lectures as written down by students, no<br/>&apos;evidence&apos; of compositions or even any musical illustrations.)</p><p>As a matter of fact, this little discrepancy described by<br/>Litchfield still occurred in the interpretation I&apos;ve published<br/>on my webpage, and is exactly what still bothered me about it.<br/>In my new interpretation, the tuning method described by<br/>Aristoxenus ends with an interval at the end here which is<br/>699 cents, which is audibly indistinguishable from a &apos;perfect 5th&apos;.<br/>That&apos;s the main reason why I think my latest interpretation is<br/>the correct one.</p><p>Since many of you may by now be wondering, here&apos;s my new<br/>interpretation in a very small nutshell:</p><p>Aristoxenus tuned the &apos;fixed notes&apos; of his tetrachords &apos;by concords&apos;,<br/>that is, as &apos;perfect 4ths&apos; by ear, which is more-or-less synonymous<br/>with making them 4:3 ratios.  Then, he divided the string-lengths<br/>of each of these 4:3s into 5 equal parts, so that a &apos;4th&apos; really<br/>*does* equal &apos;2 and a half tones&apos;.</p><p>The resulting &apos;Greater Perfect System&apos; has lots of 3- and 5-limit<br/>ratios, and - something which stunned me - several of 17- and<br/>19-limit which are *identical* to the ones proposed by Ganassi<br/>in 1543 to produce the &apos;ancient genera&apos; (_Regula Rubertina_,<br/>chapter 4... Ganassi is also in my book.)</p><p>This interpretation of Aristoxenus also produces a plethora of<br/>super-particular ratios between scale degrees, as reflected in<br/>the tunings of all later Greek theorists, such as Eratosthenes,<br/>Didymus, Ptolemy, and Aristides Quintilianus; I consider this<br/>to be yet more &apos;evidence&apos; in support of my new interpretation.</p><p>I&apos;m going to be pretty much offline for the next month, as I<br/>have to travel to Philadelphia for a few weeks.  (Really<br/>disappointed to miss Microthon by such a narrow margin!...)<br/>So I won&apos;t have time to put the new Aristoxenus stuff up on<br/>the site for a while yet... but if anyone wants to do the<br/>calculations, all you need is the info above.</p><p>(Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to stop in and visit my NYC colleagues<br/>while on the east coast.)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=15333 href="#15333">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2000 9:38:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Bill Alves &lt;ALVES@O...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15306">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/15306</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This gives me the same number of pitches as 72TET, though in JI.<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t need a precise notation (like Johnston&apos;s or Wolf&apos;s or<br/>&gt; Monzo&apos;s) because the players are usually tuning to a reference<br/>&gt; pitch sounding in the computer accompaniment. They just need to<br/>&gt; know where approximately they need to aim for in relation to the<br/>&gt; pitches they&apos;re used to playing. Because of the consistency of<br/>&gt; 72TET in relation to JI, the approximation is usually good to<br/>&gt; within a few cents.</p><p>This is pretty much exactly how Ezra Sims summed up his methods<br/>to me.  And what he said also echoed Paul Erlich&apos;s statements<br/>in his recent post analyzing 72-tET great abilities to &apos;mimic&apos;<br/>high-limit JI: Sims has made computer versions of his pieces<br/>in both 37-limit JI and 72-tET, and says that unless hard pressed,<br/>he can&apos;t tell the difference.  His notation is entirely 72-tET,<br/>but because the harmonies are theoretically based on JI and<br/>summation and difference tones, the players can use their ears<br/>to adjust their intonation and get it quite accurate.</p><p>Perhaps this is also the place to say that, while I&apos;ve had<br/>much criticism for Ben Johnston&apos;s notational system, Johnston<br/>developed it gradually out of exactly the same principles:<br/>symbols that represent relationships that the performers can<br/>*hear*, and therefore &apos;get right&apos;.  It&apos;s simply his use<br/>of a 2-factor scale (prime-factors 3 and 5) for the basic<br/>symbol set that I see as causing the problems with it.  It&apos;s<br/>an entirely logical system, but more complicated than it had<br/>to be.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
