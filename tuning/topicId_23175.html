I haven&apos;t seen an explanation for it,<br/>&gt; but it possibly stems from the fact that a chain of harmonic<br/>&gt; sevenths produces a slendro-type scale, perhaps not a typical one,<br/>&gt; but I don&apos;t see another connection.</p><p>As Graham Breed helpfully explained:</p><p>&gt; To clarify this, a pentatonic with the following ratios</p><p>&gt; 8:7   8:7   8:7   8:7   7:6</p><p>&gt; has roughly equal steps, and roughly makes an octave.  So you could<br/>&gt; call it a gamelan scale, and the 1029:1024 is what stops it being a<br/>&gt; perfect octave, hence &quot;gamelan residue&quot;.  I don&apos;t think it is call<br/>&gt; it a gamelan scale, and the 1029:1024 is what stops it being a<br/>&gt; perfect octave, hence &quot;gamelan residue&quot;.  I don&apos;t think it is<br/>&gt; connected with any real gamelan tuning, other than being roughly<br/>&gt; 5-equal.</p><p>This is fascinating, and in Scala I confirmed that</p><p>calculate 2/1 - (8/7^4 + 7/6)</p><p>indeed yields an interval of ~8.44 cents identified as a &quot;gamelan<br/>residue.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Tempering out the 1029:1024 gives Margo&apos;s tuning, and tempering out<br/>&gt; a 225:224 kleisma as well gives you 7-limit Miracle temperament.  I<br/>&gt; had thought about this pentatonic a few years back, it looks like<br/>&gt; Fokker must have too.</p><p>Graham, may I gently amend the beginning of your paragraph to:<br/>&quot;Tempering out the 1029:1024 gives Manuel&apos;s tuning, later<br/>rediscovered by Margo with the very full benefit of sustained<br/>discussions on a generator of almost exactly half the size&quot;?</p><p>Curiously, the threefold division of the 1029:1024 was the last of the<br/>three &quot;tripartite divisions&quot; I recognized in this tuning, maybe not so<br/>surprising since I was coming from a Pythagorean and neo-Gothic kind<br/>of perspective where the pure fifths were the outstanding feature.</p><p>Having followed the not inconsequential or obscure &quot;Miracle&quot; threads<br/>on this forum, I was in search of some unconventional generator with a<br/>&quot;neo-Gothic&quot; flavor. The idea of generator at some precise fraction of<br/>a pure fifth, of course, would have a special appeal, given my desire<br/>for something at once &quot;quasi-Pythagorean&quot; and also &quot;offbeat.&quot;</p><p>When I tried 3:2^1/3 in Scala, and saw the neat approximations of<br/>neo-Gothic 7-flavor ratios it produced (9:7, 7:6, 7:4, and octave<br/>complements), I was really excited.</p><p>As I quickly realized, this was very close to 36-tET, a scale I have<br/>enthusiastically praised here for its 7-flavor and also 17-flavor<br/>intervals (e.g. a nice approximation of 14:17:21) -- just as the<br/>&quot;Miracle Scale&quot; can be realized in 72-tET, and many in fact prefer<br/>this realization.</p><p>The threefold division of the pure fifth was thus the defining one for<br/>me.</p><p>Then, looking at the difference of about 30.075 cents by which five of<br/>the 233.965-cent generators fall short of a 2:1 octave, I realized<br/>that three of these &quot;commas&quot; were precisely equal to a Pythagorean<br/>limma or diatonic semitone at 256:243 (~90.224 cents). Another<br/>tripartite division, and one most delightful from my Pythagorean<br/>perspective! In 7-flavor cadences, by the way, a small semitone (which<br/>one might take as an approximation of 28:27, ~62.96 cents) is favored<br/>equal to precisely 2/3 of a Pythagorean limma, or ~60.15 cents.</p><p>It was only when I reflected more on the 36-tET affinity, and on the<br/>way that in 36-tET (or 36-ED2, as some would say) the same 33-1/3-cent<br/>step takes the place both of the septimal comma at 64:63 (~27.26<br/>cents) and the 49:48 comma (~35.70 cents), that I considered the ratio<br/>defining the difference of these commas, 1029:1024.</p><p>Already I had noted that fifths are pure in 233.985-cent tuning, while<br/>all 7-flavor intervals are impure by ~2.81 cents. I now realized that<br/>this variation from pure is equal to precisely 1/3 of the 1029:1024<br/>schisma, or whatever we choose to call the &quot;gamelan residue&quot; in a<br/>neo-Gothic setting.</p><p>For me, this was poetic: three tripartite divisions on different<br/>levels -- the fifth, the limma, and the 1029:1024 schisma.</p><p>Anyway, when I found Manuel&apos;s file documenting an identical scale in<br/>31 notes -- a strictly proper MOS, by the way, as Dave Keenan notes --<br/>I looked up &quot;gamelan residue&quot; in intnam.par and wasn&apos;t surprised to<br/>find that it was equal to 1029:1024.</p><p>(My version, as usual, was for 24 notes mapped to two 12-note<br/>keyboards, however less than ideal for this type of tuning.)</p><p>Contrasting Manuel&apos;s original discovery of this scale with my<br/>&quot;rediscovery,&quot; I remarked in my first report that 3:2^1/3 was hardly<br/>so surprising an idea on my part after reading about 3:2^1/6 as the<br/>main topic on this forum for some days, to say the least. Paul Erlich<br/>made the same point even more succinctly in response to that post:</p><p>         &gt; it&apos;s just every other note of &quot;miracle tuning&quot;, since<br/>         &gt; the generator is exactly twice as big.</p><p>Leaving it to Manuel to choose a fitting name, I would mainly like to<br/>help ensure that his 233.985-cent tuning is celebrated with credit<br/>given where it is properly due, adorned also by an auspicious<br/>association with the name of the illustrious Adriaan Fokker.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
