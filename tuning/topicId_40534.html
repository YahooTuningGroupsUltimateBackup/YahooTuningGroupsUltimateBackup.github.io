People sing it all over the world and for good<br/>reason. It is beautiful, simple though not easy and just within the<br/>reach of most amateur choirs.</p><p>A few moments with the score shows the simplicity of the piece. It has<br/>been conceived as a melody which then undergoes various transformations.<br/>The inversions and retrogrades are then used contrapuntally within a<br/>variety of textures.</p><p>My interest is in how to tune the piece with an actual choir. I&apos;m sure<br/>there are as many interpretations as there are conductors. According to<br/>the composer the principal melody just made itself known and the piece<br/>took its shape from that. A conventional knowledge of standard notation<br/>and 12 tet would seem to suffice in order to arrive at a decent<br/>rendition. It&apos;s not quite as simple as that however and I&apos;ll take one<br/>combination as an example. Feel free to correct my sums.</p><p>The opening soprano melody, disregarding note values, is g, b, b, a, a,<br/>f#, g, g. We are firmly in a G major tonality. The question of which<br/>melodic intervals would be most likely from g at 1/1 might take some<br/>field work. It would be reasonable to propose that your average singer<br/>would sing these pitches as 1/1, 5/4, 9/8, 15/8, 1/1 (as opposed to<br/>their 12 tet equivalents).</p><p>The problems start when the alto adds a counterpoint which is an exact<br/>inversion of the soprano line, ie g ,eb, eb, f, f, ab, g, g.  The voices<br/>cross before the final g. Coming at it with the G tonality already set<br/>up you might sing this as 1/, 8/5, 16/9, 16/15.</p><p>Stacked vertically you get the following: 1:1,  25:16,  81:64,  256:225,<br/>1:1.</p><p>If we want simple low ratio vertical intervals between pitches, such as<br/>8:5, 5:4, and 9:8 then it looks to me as if we have comma problems - a<br/>diesis with the second interval and a syntonic comma with the 81:64.<br/>Singing a 9/5 instead of a 16/ 9 in the alto line fixes one of the<br/>problems.</p><p>Let&apos;s say we absolutely must have the low ratio intervals. Then the alto<br/>would have to sing 1/, 25/16, 9/5 and 135/128, which seems unlikely to<br/>my ears.</p><p>What do I think happens? Well, given that the piece seems to work with<br/>untrained singers, I think that the alto holds a line, similar to an<br/>infantry advance, aiming for the final g, or more likely the<br/>quasi-cadential crunch before the g. This type of two voice sonority by<br/>the way is one of the earliest notated cadences in Western music. I<br/>encourage this approach with my modest choirs and am pleased with the<br/>results. Although I am a firm believer in adaptive Just Intonation, I<br/>don&apos;t think there is enough context here to allow the alto to work<br/>through the intervals. Certainly a different approach is needed for the<br/>four voice textures. Additionally, most choral directors I know wouldn&apos;t<br/>know a diesis from a badger&apos;s posterior so they might not be too<br/>concerned.</p><p>All in all a fine example of the conflicting requirements of the linear<br/>and the vertical in a contemporary score.</p><p>Kind Regards</p><p>AM</p></div><h3><a id=40539 href="#40539">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2002 12:14:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Although I am a firm believer in adaptive Just Intonation,</p><p>well, i&apos;m glad you believe in adaptive, rather than strict, just<br/>intonation . . .</p><p>but how about adaptive tuning? i&apos;m not sure that chords like C-E-G-A-<br/>D, to pick a random example, should be tuned in just intonation.<br/>other chords may certainly gravitate very close to just intonation,<br/>but do horizontal considerations vanish absolutely to zero for such<br/>chord?</p><p>&gt; I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t think there is enough context here to allow the alto to work<br/>&gt; through the intervals.
