Rather than being a missed harmonic<br/>&gt; opportunity, the dissonant sixth gave the music impetus to move forward and<br/>&gt; resolve.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re saying that the Greeks sounded this ratio in their music, but didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; consider it consonant?  Does that mean that the only &quot;consonant&quot; ratios were<br/>&gt; 3/2 and 4/3?</p><p>That is true not of the Greeks, but of the Europeans from 900-1200 (and to some extent through 1450). You<br/>should read Margo Schulter&apos;s stuff again.</p><p>The ancient Greeks did not like harmony in their music at all.</p><p>&gt; In a more general sense, I find LCM useful because it describes the pattern<br/>&gt; of waveform interference when a chord is sounded.  Here, I am speaking of the<br/>&gt; LCMs of the periods of the sounds, not the frequency, though in practice, not<br/>&gt; a lot is lost by using the LCMs of the frequencies.  I am not claiming LCM is<br/>&gt; a completely accurate description of consonance, but I think it certainly<br/>&gt; tracks a lot better than limits, be they prime or odd.  It is certainly<br/>&gt; possible to generate 3-limit intervals that nearly everyone would find<br/>&gt; dissonant.</p><p>OK, Marion, give us an example of a dissonant interval whose odd limit is 3.</p><p>&gt; The 16/9 ratio has an LCM of 144, but it can be approximated by 7/4 with an<br/>&gt; LCM of 28 and a 1.59% error.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 27/16 ratio has an LCM of 432, but it can be approximated by 5/3 with an<br/>&gt; LCM of 15 and a 1.25% error.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 32/27 ratio has an LCM of 864, but it can be approximated by 13/11 with<br/>&gt; an LCM of 143 and a 0.28% error.  It can also be approximated by 6/5 with an<br/>&gt; LCM of 30 and an error of 1.23%.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 81/64 ratio has an LCM of 5184, but it can be approximated by 19/15 with<br/>&gt; an LCM of 285, and an error of 0.08%.  It can also be approximated by 5/4<br/>&gt; with an LCM of 20 and an error of 1.25%.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 128/81 ratio has an LCM of 10,368, but it can be approximated by 19/12<br/>&gt; with an LCM of 228 and an error of 0.19%.  It can also be approximated by 8/5<br/>&gt; with an LCM of 40 and an error of 1.23%.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 243/128 ratio has an LCM of 31,104, but it can be approximated by 19/10<br/>&gt; with an LCM of 190 with an error of 0.08%.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The 729/512 ratio has an LCM of 373,248, but it can be approximated by 10/7<br/>&gt; with an LCM of 70 and an error of 0.33%.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it possible that these musicians were trying to play 3-limit but were<br/>&gt; really playing 19 limit music?  We&apos;ll probably never know, but we may someday<br/>&gt; be able to accurately describe what contemporary musicians are doing with a<br/>&gt; reasonable degree of accuracy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems clear to me that the 729/512 ratio at least was almost never used in<br/>&gt; practice.  At 440hz the pattern created by this interval would take 850<br/>&gt; seconds, or 14 minutes to repeat-longer than most songs.  Even the 32/27<br/>&gt; pattern would take almost 2 seconds at 440HZ.  Some of these claims of tuning<br/>&gt; accuracy seem a little shaky to me.</p><p>Again, Marion, you are making the mistake of assuming that all these pitches will be measured against the<br/>1/1. That is not so. 729/512 is so tuned in order to be consonant with the 243/128, which is so tuned in<br/>order to be consonant with the 81/64, which is so tuned in order to be consonant with the 27/16, which is so<br/>tuned in order to be consonant with the 9/8, which is so tuned in order to be consonant with the 3/2, which<br/>is so tuned in order to be consonant with the 1/1. And that is a complete account of the relationships that<br/>would have been considered consonant in Medieval times. 3:2 and 4:3 in all cases. No other relationships<br/>were considered consonant. The properties of 729/512 sounding against 1/1 are completely irrelevant (except<br/>for the important property that it is not consonant).</p><p>People,</p><p>Just because ratios are being used to measure pitches relative to a fixed 1/1, doesn&apos;t mean the harmonic<br/>properties of those ratios have ANYTHING to do with music constructed with those pitches. It is only the<br/>ratios BETWEEN pitches that are actually sounded together in the music that matter. We have to be careful to<br/>distinguish between ratios used to represent pitch and ratios used to represent intervals. The best way I&apos;ve<br/>seen is to use a slash (e.g., 729/512) when representing pitches and to use a colon (e.g., 3:2) when<br/>representing intervals. But a notational convention will only help if we are thinking carefully about what<br/>is going on.</p></div><h3>Brett Barbaro &#x3C;barbaro@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/1999 12:20:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marion wrote:</p><p>&gt; With a lattice approach you might, for example use the familiar:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6 9<br/>&gt; 5 8 15<br/>&gt; 4 6 16</p><p>What is that? It doen&apos;t remind me of any lattice approach I&apos;ve ever seen. A lattice is an infinite<br/>arrangement of points such that the configuration of every point relative to its neighbors is the same as<br/>that of any other point relative to the second point&apos;s neighbors.</p><p>&gt; Just multiplying a<br/>&gt; number of lattice elements together is prone to producing scales that have a<br/>&gt; low LCM to tone ratio.  In other words, scales which will not fully utilize<br/>&gt; the tuning capacity of a discretely-tuned electronic musical instrument.</p><p>What does electronics have to do with it?</p><p>&gt; Of course, these considerations only apply to exact JI.  If you allow<br/>&gt; approximation to come into the picture, then you are in a different universe,<br/>&gt; which in my opinion is not a JI universe but a tempered universe.</p><p>Approximations exist in JI as well. It is unavoidable that one will hear a very complex ratio as a simple<br/>one if it the former is very near to the latter, e.g., 30001:20001 will be heard as 3:2.</p><p>&gt; The lattice approach is efficient for generating scales which contain<br/>&gt; specified parallelism.  That is the above lattice is guaranteed to generate<br/>&gt; scales which have 4:5:6 chords.  If some sense, the lattice elements are<br/>&gt; matrix factors of the scale.</p><p>Again, I don&apos;t know what lattice approach you&apos;re talking about. The triangular lattice approach that has<br/>been used on this list for some time now (by me, Paul Hahn, Graham Breed, Carl Lumma, Dave Keenan, bram,<br/>etc.) is efficient for finding scales where many consonant structures can be found, parellelism or no.</p><p>Furthermore, the rectangular lattice and the LCM idea are intimately tied together, as shown by Euler&apos;s work<br/>centuries ago. Tenney&apos;s complexity measure for intervals on the rectangular lattice is just the log of the<br/>LCM.</p><p>&gt; I came across a paper by Margo,<br/>&gt; which I took as authoritative, but at that time I was unaware of her<br/>&gt; contributions to the list.</p><p>Do you mean that the fact that she made contributions to the list made you stop thinking her paper was<br/>authoritative?</p></div>
