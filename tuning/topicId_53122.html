I must add, though, and to both lists, that I am a little disappointed to be casually told that the &quot;practical&quot; side of tuning has moved over t/here now, as though that were a predictable and perfectly unobjectionable development with no ramifications. I have a few thoughts about the change that I feel moved to share, with no offense intended to anyone, and I hope none will be taken.</p><p>Some years ago my predecessors at Bard renamed the music department the &quot;Making Music Program&quot; (shades of MMM!) in defiance of the administration&apos;s attempts to turn it into a history/theory department. Only last week I fought off yet another attempt to make theory and history central, and to relegate the performance and composition faculty to basically adjunct status. Institutions endemically tend toward a gradual shift from art to theory. It&apos;s difficult to pinpoint how this happens, though not hard to find excuses for. Art is a demanding mistress, and artists have little time for organization (or continual e-mail postings). Organization of hierarchies and structures requires the same kind of analytical mind that theorists must have by definition, and they take to it like ducks to water. Theory and history can always prove themselves with arguments and facts, and always seem so respectable; artists can never prove what they&apos;re doing, and are always so vulnerable. The great stone walls of theory always get built eventually, and the tender seedlings of art get trampled underfoot in the process. And as stone walls multiply, the wilderness of the mind that art both needs and represents gets pushed further away from the city.</p><p>And so, when the great composers who taught in academia in the &apos;70s (like Johnston, Martirano, Feldman) retired, the status-conscious departments of the &apos;80s replaced them with theorists. _Perspectives of New Music_ was begun by composers, Ben Boretz and J.K. Randall, and for the last several years has been edited by a consortium of theorists. Of course, one notices that when the theorists came, the Midwestern university music departments died as hotbeds of experimental musical activity. _Perspectives_ ceased to be an exciting journal of new ideas when the theorists took over. Not that I have anything against theory (hell, I&apos;m the only member of the music faculty who carries a pocket calculator, and even *uses* it in class), but without the unpredictable, irrational spark of creativity, theory tends to lie there on the table like the patient that didn&apos;t pull through. On the other other side, artists need theory, too - though, in my view, not very much of it, just a dash here and there to push their work forward, not enough to straitjacket it.</p><p>If the tuning list had split into just intonation versus various equal temperaments, I would have thought, &quot;Well, that seems unnecessary, but not harmful: each of those areas of inquiry can continue independently of the other.&quot; But a split between theory and practical creativity doesn&apos;t strike me as so innocent - especially because it suggests that the tuning list is subject to the same forces that operate in academia and other inherently conservative institutions. If we here, of all places, can&apos;t understand that theory and creativity are an interconnected yin and yang, needing each other to remain lively, who on the planet will? For god&apos;s sake, how can artistic creativity keep any meaningful foothold in society when it can&apos;t even keep a foothold in the *tuning list*?</p><p>Just a thought. I&apos;m too much of a southerner to play Abraham Lincoln. I&apos;ll secede with MMM, and I already find more of interest over t/here than I have on the tuning list in recent months. But perhaps that in itself shows how much the tuning list has to lose. I&apos;m afraid, in short, that at MMM I won&apos;t find the occasional glimpses of bizarre theory that fire my imagination - and that the tuning list, without art-talk, will become impenetrable.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle Gann</p></div><h3><a id=53123 href="#53123">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/13/2004 7:56:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 4/13/04 10:38:36 AM Eastern Daylight Time,<br/><a href="mailto:kgann@earthlink.net">kgann@earthlink.net</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; artists can never prove what they&apos;re doing, and are always so vulnerable.</p><p>Kyle&apos;s post resonates for me.  I practice microtonality every day of my life<br/>and have not migrated to MMM.  The emphasis on electronic music and technology<br/>in general is of less interest to me than that of acoustic directions.</p><p>Unfortunately, I think the problem is more of a &quot;people&quot; problem than a<br/>subject area problem.  Flaming on this list is endemic.  Sometimes I think that<br/>people that could meet and share a meal or a drink would never treat each other<br/>as some have done on this list.  Sometimes I feel that I don&apos;t belong on any of<br/>these lists, except maybe Metatuning.</p><p>In today&apos;s world, the music industry lies dead.  Academics have killed<br/>whatever still moves.  The musicians I know are in survival mode.  It&apos;s a hard<br/>environment to compose a symphony.</p><p>I don&apos;t expect any radical changes.  People have made their decisions<br/>already.  Lines have been drawn and would have to be crossed.  Of course, I thank the<br/>many that have, and continue, to support the AFMM&apos;s microtonal work, and my<br/>work in particular.  The List has been very valuable to me in years past.  It<br/>may be a resource to newbies and to the intellectual pursuers of &quot;what ifs&quot; in<br/>sound.  But for those making real microtonal music, it is all too often a<br/>detour.</p><p>At least there is an occasional post of practical interest.</p><p>best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=53124 href="#53124">ðŸ”—</a>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante@interport.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2004 10:52:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>All you need to do to heal the split is to have your email program send all<br/>the email from the various tuning groups into one folder called....<br/>&quot;tuning&quot;.
