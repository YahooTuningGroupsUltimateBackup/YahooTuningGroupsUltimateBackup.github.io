It should require almost no pressure to move</p><p>&gt;them.</p><p>    It should require between 46 and 56 grams of downforce,depending on the<br/>piano and location on the scale. key to key differences should be less than a<br/>gram.   However, that is only part of the equation.  Properly regulated<br/>actions have the proper upweight, too, and the relationship of up to<br/>downweight is the determination of &quot;touch&quot;.<br/>    There is an optimum amount of friction involved, as well as the all<br/>important ratios that exist within the action.  You have a folded beam<br/>mechanism that takes three opposing arcs into account to produce a very<br/>particular resistance.  The use of lead weights in the keys is universal, to<br/>get the balance right, however, a poor set of ratios, or overly large hammers,<br/>will call for so much lead that the inertial resistance to fast play makes the<br/>piano feel like a truck if you play it hard!</p><p>Carl again:</p><p>&gt;The majority of pianos are poorly regulated.<br/>     I agree 1000%</p><p>&gt;It isn&apos;t too difficult, and</p><p>&gt;you can do it yourself with $20 worth of tools<br/>        I disagree 1000%.  Unless this is in the same vein as throwing a clay<br/>pot,  where it is easily seen how simple it is to do (:)}}.<br/>    Perhaps a gross adjustment of the parts is possible by the novice, (though<br/>in my experience, the ensuing breakage cost them more than they expected), but<br/>fine regulation, of the sort expected by professional pianist, is a long time<br/>learned.</p><p>Carl again:<br/> &gt; A good grand action resets the instant the hammer leaves the</p><p>&gt;jack.<br/>     Hmm,  not quite. The hammer goes into check, but the key must still be<br/>allowed to rise a certain amount for the jact to reset, (at least partially)<br/>under the knuckle.<br/>The major factor in repetition speed of a grand is the height at which the<br/>hammer checks under the string, for this determines how much upward key travel<br/>is necessary for the jack to go back.<br/>     There is a downside to this, in that the higher the hammer checks, the<br/>less force the pianist can apply to the string.  Ya just can&apos;t get much energy<br/>going in 1/4&quot; of hammer travel!  There is a particular distance that is<br/>optimum.  Normal checking height is halfway to the string from rest, but the<br/>faster classical pieces benefit from a closer setting.  Making springs<br/>stronger is a mistake, as it interferes with the most delicate pianissimo<br/>control provides no faster key return than a moderate spring.</p><p>&gt;Stride was developed on uprights, because it took that long for the</p><p>&gt;keys to pop back up.<br/>       A properly regulated upright will repeat faster than any stride I ever<br/>heard.  But an  upright is not as fast as a grand, and I don&apos;t think ever will<br/>be.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote<br/>Precision Piano Works<br/>Nashville, Tn.<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/index.html">http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/index.html</a></p></div>
