I was the first person<br/>to figure out that baseball had a social importance beyond the beer-swilling<br/>yahoos who watch it. And most recently, I forced America to acknowledge that<br/>Negroes had a key role in the birth and development of jazz music. Now I<br/>want to share my life&apos;s pilgrimage -- an adventure that is nothing less than<br/>a blueprint for Joseph Campbell&apos;s Hero&apos;s Journey -- so that others might<br/>benefit.&quot;</p><p>Burns will utilize archival photos, drawings, vintage 8mm family film clips<br/>and Japanese shadow puppets to dramatize his life. Interviews will include<br/>Mrs. Blanche Goltz, his 3rd grade teacher; Finley Blasingame, his agent;<br/>Kent Zimmer, a man he impressed at a party by naming every member of the<br/>Miles Davis &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; quintet; and Thorndyke Havrisham Jr.,<br/>Vice-President of Public Broadcasting and the third person to call Burns a<br/>genius.</p><p>After a lengthy negotiation, Burns has also agreed to an extensive interview<br/>with himself. &quot;I didn&apos;t know if I could get me. But after I explained just<br/>how important I was to my story, I talked myself into it.&quot; He didn&apos;t<br/>disappoint himself -- he was able to uncover surprising insights about his<br/>own life. &quot;Before I undertook this project,&quot; says Burns, &quot;I had no idea that<br/>I had done so much to enlighten so many ignorant, wretched people. I had no<br/>idea I was such an avatar of enlightened edu-tainment, especially as it<br/>pertains to my funky soul brothers. And I had no idea that I liked great old<br/>movies, romantic walks on the beach, and a glass of wine by the fire.&quot;</p><p>The entire project will take 5 years and cost 11 million dollars. The cost<br/>is being underwritten by General Motors, the Corporation for Public<br/>Broadcasting, and whatever tobacco company is most in need of positive PR<br/>spin at the end of this year. The first episode, &quot;From Cosmic Dream-Dust to<br/>Potty-Training&quot; will air in 2005. The last episode, &quot;Everything A Human<br/>Being Can and Should Be&quot; might air as late as 2007.</p></div><h3><a id=19376 href="#19376">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/24/2001 10:24:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Seth Austen &lt;klezmusic@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19339.html#19339">/tuning/topicId_19339.html#19339</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; New PBS show ....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ken Burns&apos; &quot;Ken Burns&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Nice parody, Seth.
