If you&apos;re<br/>comparing a note of x Hz and a note 23 cents above, the difference between<br/>them is</p><p>x*(2^(23/1200)-1)</p><p>or</p><p>x*0.0134.</p><p>&gt;Open question to the list__some folks with very good hearing (darren<br/>burgess)can discern a deviation &gt;of 3hz. What can you discern?</p><p>Hz is a poor measure of the just-noticable difference. For most people in<br/>most contexts, it&apos;s on the order of a few cents, while the Hz difference<br/>will vary widely in different registers.</p><p>&gt;How does one overcome the compensation factor that sometimes people<br/>experience when tuning? &gt;When tuning what portion of the arc is most<br/>satisfying when tuning.</p><p>No comprendo.</p></div>
