I too realized that what I posed<br/>worked exactly as I stated except ONLY for the 2-limit instead<br/>of &apos;for all consistent limits including the 2-limit&apos;. Just<br/>a little glitch, yep.</p><p>And I hadn&apos;t considered at all consistencies that may be<br/>added through stretching or compression.</p><p>In terms of preserving all consistencies, the MAX stretch<br/>or compress value would have to take into account the limit<br/>that is expressed with the highest error in the direction<br/>of the stretch or compress. (MAX stretch would have to look<br/>at the sharpmost term of interest and MAX compress would<br/>have to consider the flatmost). I considered only the<br/>2-limit which has zero error in an EDO).</p><p>Can&apos;t do it now, but theres an intersting set of stuff to think<br/>about.<br/>&#x9;stretch/compress preserving all consistent limits<br/>            of a given system<br/>&#x9;stretch/compress adding (and perhaps removing)<br/>            consistent limits of a given system<br/>        nonlinear stretch/compress (warping) of a given system<br/>            (preserving or adding or subtracting consistencies)</p><p>thanks, Bob Valentine</p></div>
