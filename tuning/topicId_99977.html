Surprisingly, their quotient is 1.5 = 3/2. The new task was to buid a scale where these two ratios could operate as Eb and Bb.</p><p>The way was given by the interval 2C / Bb : (1.78125 / 1.1875) = 1.12280701754<br/>The above interval is close to equal tempered D so it will tentatively work as D.<br/>D fifth equals to 1.12280701754 x 1.5 = 1.68421052631, this value might be A. We got the contiguous frequency tones of    A and Bb and therefore we can get its interval factor by dividing (Bb / A) = (1.78125 / 1.68421052631) = 1.0576171875</p><p>The (C / C#) decimal interval is supposed to be the latest one (1.0576171875); it is also C# relative frequency with respect to C. Now we have the contiguous C# - D tone frequency values and their interval factor given by:</p><p>(D / C#) = (1.12280701754 / 1.0576171875) = 1.06163839885.</p><p>Besides the interval factor (9/8)^0.5 = 1.06066017178 = q, two types<br/>of factors m and p work in the octave, the scale is detailed here:</p><p>C----------- ( - 2.5 cents) ----------------------- 261.25 Hz<br/>(x 1.0576171875) = m</p><p>C# ---- 1.0576171875 = (1083 / 1024)    ( 94.5 cents) ---------- 276.3025 Hz<br/>(x 1.06163839885) = p</p><p>D -----  1.12280701754  = (64 / 57)        ( 198 cents) ------------ 293.3333<br/>x m<br/>Eb ---- 1.1875 = (19 / 16)                      (  295 cents) ----------- 310.2344<br/>x p<br/>E ------ 1.26069559863 = (4096 / 3249)  ( 398.6 cents) ----------- 329.3567<br/>x m<br/>F ------ 1.33333333333 = (4/3)               ( 495.6 cents) ----------- 348.3333<br/>x q<br/>F# ---- 1.41421356237 = 2^0.5               ( 597.5 cents) ----------- 369.4633<br/>x q<br/>G ------ 1.5 = (3/2)                                 ( 699.5 cents) ----------- 391.875<br/>x m<br/>Ab ----- 1.58642578125 = (3249 / 2048)   ( 796.5 cents) ----------- 414.4537<br/>x p<br/>A ------ 1.68421052631 = (32 / 19)      ( 900 cents )  ------ 440 Hz<br/>x m<br/>Bb --- 1.78125 = (57 / 32)                 ( 997 cents) -------- 465.3516<br/>x p<br/>B ---- 1.89104339795 = (2048 / 1083)   ( 1100.5 cents)--- 494.0351 Hz<br/>x m<br/>2C ---                                                      (1197.5 cents) ---- 522.5 Hz<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>Last night we succeded in the grand piano tuning with Piagui IV scale, as we<br/>named to the new scale. After Luis Enrique Colmenares played<br/>some pieces, the fantastic chord qualities clearly convinced us that this<br/>scale is even better than Piagui I. After that, the piano tuned to the tempered scale was<br/>availed to compare chords and triad components. Notes C#, Eb, F, Ab gave the<br/>new taste to everything listened with astonishment.</p><p>Once the first pieces were listened I waited for the opinion of Luis<br/>Enrique, the pianist, and Armando Becerra, the technician on tuning, they are<br/>related with the piano chord sounds over the years. Both have said enthusiastically:<br/>&quot;Not only the harmony but everything is clearly more pleasant than what is heard on<br/>a piano tuned to the Tempered scale, all the expressions overcome everything<br/>we listened before.&quot;</p><p>I sent to two members of the list  the complete information of this new scale; they<br/>didn&apos;t answer my message; since I attached a table I had to send it to their<br/>personal address, which might be cancelled; lack of politeness is hard to endure.<br/>I know they are still busy with microtonalty, may be this contributed to cancel their<br/>expected answers. This is not a claim but if they take the way of ignoring what is<br/>going on outside of their country unless it is done by the same group of the list, they<br/>could realize that not only microtonalty is an important field. The twelve tone scales still<br/>require research as it was proved with what was achieved last night on the piano.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Mario</p><p>June 12</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2011 2:19:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sun, Jun 12, 2011 at 5:08 PM, Mario Pizarro &lt;piagui@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear fellows,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is no a twelve tone scale&nbsp;that can&nbsp;be recognized in most of the occidental countries as being the optimal solution for producing&nbsp;real harmonized&nbsp;chords&nbsp;and&nbsp;best expressions on the piano and other instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Early in this month,&nbsp;when&nbsp;working with&nbsp;square array diagonals,&nbsp;the following&nbsp;two decimal ratios appeared:<br/>&gt; 1.1875 and 1.78125.

If you were to<br/>look at some other note, you might find that there are lots of other<br/>harmonic possibilities that only having 12-notes doesn&apos;t offer. If<br/>harmonic purity is what you&apos;re after, you might like looking at some<br/>19-note scales, as well as 22-note ones as well. Guitars won&apos;t have a<br/>problem with them, since they can have as many frets as they want.<br/>Pianos are a bit harder, but with modern MIDI controllers like the<br/>AXiS</p><p><a href="http://www.c-thru-music.com/cgi/">http://www.c-thru-music.com/cgi/</a></p><p>people can explore unconventional scales. Maybe you&apos;d enjoy giving that a shot.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2011 3:03:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; 19/16 and 57/32!
