I&apos;ve used it in combinations in my string quartet, and in a piece<br/>called _Millennium_ which had a fairly homophonic 3 part treatment for its<br/>tutti.  I can sing it easily by setting up my neutral third and then finding<br/>the dieses by splitting the N3 into 2 even parts.  Then, keep on adding the<br/>next sequential increment until reaching the octave.</p><p>Swiss ethnomusicologist Hugo Zemp discovered a theorist for the &apos;Are&apos;are<br/>people of the North Soloman Islands who declared that there was a measurement<br/>process - involving a particular plant stem - that gave the 7ET diesis.  As a<br/>result of Zemp&apos;s documentation - and in combination with Steven Feld&apos;s<br/>theoretical analysis of the emic data of the music theory of the Kaluli of New<br/>Guinea, a revolution in the belief of ethnomusicologists took place.  Now;<br/>musical cultures are believed each have their own music theorists.  (The<br/>previous Merriam doctrine had maintained the opposite as an accepted belief.)<br/>Revolution by 7ET.</p><p>The Thai were originally from the southern reaches of China (known there as<br/>the Dai-some still remain) that migrated south to escape the tyranny of the<br/>Mongols.  Their name for themselves means &quot;free&quot; and they have never been<br/>under the control of a foreign power, unlike most any other people.</p><p>While at Columbia University in its graduate ethnomusicology department I<br/>studied Chinese music advanced level with professor/composer Chow Wen Chung.<br/>As the only graded report I was to give to that class, I presented an oral<br/>report which was well received.  The Thai having had the knowledge of the<br/>Chinese specificity of pentatonic with its 5 main tones and 2 auxilliaries<br/>which could easily modulate.  This means 7 notes. South into Malaysian and<br/>Indonesian pelogs would influence the Thai to looseness of placement of the<br/>tones.</p><p>Cambodeans use a loose array of 7, so do Laotians (who are related to the<br/>Thai), as do much of Myanmar.  Thais were intensively travelling within their<br/>own domain and needed to communicate in an equiheptaphonic tuning - 7ET.  When<br/>it is exactly tuned it works well both melodically and harmonically.  BTW, I<br/>like 5ET too which is reputedly only used in a particular tribe in Uganda for<br/>very fast flute music.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>American Festival of Microtonal Music<br/><a href="mailto:afmmjr@aol.com">afmmjr@aol.com</a></p></div>
