I did think it<br/>would be neat to have the traffic sound as if it were decellerating as it<br/>left the stopsign or to hear a reversed dopler effect, but there was always<br/>too much in the sound that simply made my brain say &quot;backward noise.&quot;<br/>Jay<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You do not need web access to participate.

I recorded much of a<br/>&gt; stockcar race once. With the sounds at that volume, there weren&apos;t any<br/>&gt; echoes to tell my brain that the space got reversed, and it really did seem<br/>&gt; a bit odd to hear the traffic constantly rising in pitch as it went by. I<br/>&gt; suppose if you record from the middle of a highway with few trees around<br/>&gt; you could produce some pretty interesting illusions. It&apos;s just thatcha<br/>&gt; don&apos;t want any sounds that ring or produce echoes.</p><p>This does sound interesting. I&apos;d like to hear it!</p><p>Also interested in what you say about echoes. I&apos;d never quite noticed the echo<br/>that trails the car sound before, for instance as it travels along a street.</p><p>I can imagine that if one had the echo preceding the car, it would sound &quot;backwards&quot;.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Jay Williams &#x3C;jaywill@tscnet.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/8/2001 12:10:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 08:38 PM 4/8/01 +0100, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Also interested in what you say about echoes.

Trees aren&apos;t so bad. But the main culprit<br/>would be the metallic percussion noises. You&apos;d hafta delete the<br/>engine-knockings and the loose chrome things.<br/>Jay</p></div>
