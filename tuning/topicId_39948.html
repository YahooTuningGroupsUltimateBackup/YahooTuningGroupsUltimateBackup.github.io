Here&apos;s the quote:</p><p>&quot;Interestingly enough, Partch&apos;s system has an early, and unique,<br/>forerunner:  the French acoustician Joseph Sauveur&apos;s &apos;merides&apos; of<br/>1701, in which the octave was split into forty-three intervals.  Each<br/>of the seven diatonic notes and their syllables, ut to si, were<br/>divided into six parts, which he termed &quot;merides...&quot;</p><p>He goes on (page 136):</p><p>&quot;...so far the 43-tone scale has not won over as many advocates as<br/>the scales of nineteen, twenty-four, thirty-one and fifty-three tones<br/>per octave...&quot;</p><p>Now, the previous chapters have been discussing EQUAL temperaments.<br/>Partch&apos;s scale is definitely *not* an ET.  So how can he &quot;lump&quot; it in<br/>with the ET&apos;s?</p><p>More to the point, is Sauveur&apos;s scale an ET as well??  It doesn&apos;t<br/>seem as though it is... This is rather unclear...</p><p>Help??</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>J.
