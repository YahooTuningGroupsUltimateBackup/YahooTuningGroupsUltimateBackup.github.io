Partch and<br/>Set Theory may also be somewhat orthogonal so...</p><p>My weekend experiments went fairly badly. I<br/>generated a psuedo-harmonic-entropy array, and<br/>walked an LLsLLLs against it to see where it<br/>settled. The good news was that Pythagorean<br/>and various meantones popped out, the bad news<br/>was that being a &quot;mistuned unison&quot; was a<br/>very strong attractor rather than finding the<br/>&quot;least ugly second&quot;. Of course, why hould you<br/>care if the tense simultanietys are in tune in<br/>a scale, maybe dissonance should be maximized<br/>for some intervals?</p><p>Jacky, sometime I&apos;ll get to those phi scales,<br/>keep up the good attitude.</p><p>Kraig, these experiments I&apos;m doing are just in<br/>MOS land right now. Eventually I&apos;ll want to get<br/>into scales with more than two intervals, what<br/>is the quickest way for me to grok a generator<br/>for harmonic minor (as the simplest place to<br/>start).</p><p>Referring to the first paragraph. If a &apos;less<br/>tense&apos; thread is generated along with those two,<br/>will it settle on a &quot;whole-half diminished scale&quot;<br/>or pull the whole thing to 8tet?</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
