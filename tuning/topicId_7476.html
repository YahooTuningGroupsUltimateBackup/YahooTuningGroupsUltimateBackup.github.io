I had asked Tim Thompson<br/>(keykit ) about the possibility<br/>of a micro or preset scales feuture fo ket kit but he was not interested..<br/>There is a cool program called  REICHIAN PHASE GENERATOR  that i am going to<br/>try to get running this week</p><p>anyone have any experience with Xmlib files??</p><p>But as for mico and midi i think we are still limited to midi dumped<br/>outboards</p><p>for  Windows there still is MANDEL32 whiich has plenty of midi micro scales</p><p>Pagano Out</p></div><h3><a id=7485 href="#7485">ðŸ”—</a>gbreed@xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>1/2/2000 11:41:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Patrick Pagano wrote:<br/>&gt; I think because of the new mentality<br/>&gt; and vibe<br/>&gt; of the GNU open source stuff we may be able to make some advances in<br/>&gt; getting<br/>&gt; some programmers<br/>&gt; to buiild microtonal stuff into their MIDI apps.</p><p>The spirit of open source is that you would program it in yourself if you<br/>want it.
