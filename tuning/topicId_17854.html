Its true that not ALL blues<br/>&gt; need be variable form, but the 12-bar I-IV-V canon played badly is,<br/>&gt; unfortunately, all too common.</p><p>Ain&apos;t it though? Oh well, I just keep trying to expose the students who are<br/>interested in learning blues to the real thing in its infinite variety,<br/>hoping it&apos;ll stick for a few of them...</p><p>&gt;&gt; BTW, guitar fans should check out Metheny&apos;s new Live Trio album...I<br/>&gt;&gt; heard one disc, and was mighty impressed at the creativity, the chops,<br/>&gt;&gt; and the wide stylistic range.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I attended a performance on the tour and bought the double CD. Great<br/>&gt; show and the recording captures a lot of it. That Frippish number was<br/>&gt; played about 3/4 of the way through the show and chased a few of the<br/>&gt; patrons out.  To bring this back to microtonality, he played a<br/>&gt; fretless classical (was it also with doubled courses) on a number,<br/>&gt; and for some reason, his guitar synth playing sounds especially &apos;in<br/>&gt; the cracks&apos;.</p><p>I wonder if he is using the Godin nylon string fretless that was mentioned a<br/>few months back. It&apos;s double strung.</p><p>&gt; Theres also a whole movement of &apos;fusion&apos; with Eastern European and<br/>&gt; Balkan influences (Paradox Trio, Tiny Bell Trio).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Paradox Trio (actually a quartet) is doing some very wonderful microtonal<br/>work. Their guitarist plays electric saz and another microtonal fretted<br/>instrument (I can&apos;t remember what) on about half of their newest CD. Neat<br/>klezmer/Balkan fusion.</p><p>Seth</p><p>-------<br/>Seth Austen<br/><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>email; <a href="mailto:seth@sethausten.com">seth@sethausten.com</a></p><p>--<br/>&quot;First they ignore you.
