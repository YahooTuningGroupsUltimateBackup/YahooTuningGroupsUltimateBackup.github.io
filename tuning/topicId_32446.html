Judging from the number of times<br/>that I was surprised to have found these two terms<br/>appearing in the Tuning List postings of last year (a<br/>selection of which I have read over the past several<br/>weeks), I conclude that I need no further<br/>introduction.  In these postings, questions were<br/>raised about how I made my discovery, inasmuch my<br/>hastily written article in Xenharmonikon 3 (in the<br/>spring of 1975) was necessarily brief due to an<br/>impending deadline.  It&#xFFFD;s a rather complicated story,<br/>but to put it briefly, I stumbled across these things<br/>(working alone without a computer or even a scientific<br/>calculator) while seeking ways in which to group EDO&#xFFFD;s<br/>into families according to generating intervals other<br/>than the perfect fifth.  I had no particular goal in<br/>mind other than my own enlightenment, in contrast to<br/>the very deliberate effort made by Dave Keenan and<br/>Paul Ehrlich (and associates) to find a highly compact<br/>or efficient organization of tones.  I guess you could<br/>call me the Leif Ericsson of a New World of tuning,<br/>inasmuch as this information had &#xFFFD;languished in<br/>Xenharmonikon for some 26 years&#xFFFD; (to quote message<br/>25593 from Paul).  As for which one of you gets to be<br/>Christopher Columbus, I decline to make that call, so<br/>if that&#xFFFD;s of any importance to either of you, then you<br/>two can duke it out (off list, please).</p><p>Margo Schulter managed to track me down and contacted<br/>me the first week of September about a 17-tone well<br/>temperament that I devised in 1978, which led to<br/>considerable correspondence about some rather exciting<br/>developments which will be published in the next issue<br/>of Xenharmonikon.  It was in her third e-mail<br/>(9/25/01) that she offered the news:</p><p>&lt;&lt; There was a lot of excitement this Spring when some<br/>people on the Alternate Tuning List came up with a<br/>near-JI tuning using a generator of around 7/72 octave<br/>-- and someone then discovered your article in<br/>_Xenharmonikon_ 3 (Spring 1975), &quot;A New Look at the<br/>Partch Monophonic Fabric,&quot; describing an identical<br/>keyboard scheme with a generator of 116.69 cents.</p><p>You might be amused to know that people have coined<br/>the term &quot;secor&quot; (lowercase) for a generator of around<br/>this size. For example, a 21-note tuning of this type<br/>is said to &quot;span 20 secors.&quot;  &gt;&gt;</p><p>My reply of 9/28/01 included the following:</p><p>&lt;&lt; That has to be a first.  As far as I knew, the only<br/>intervals named after anyone, living or dead, were<br/>commas, and those honored (i.e., Pythagoras and<br/>Didymus) had to be dead for a very long time to<br/>qualify. &#xFFFD; Perhaps by dropping out of sight and lying<br/>low for so many years I have given the impression of<br/>being as good as dead, so that someone thought it<br/>fitting to bestow the honor. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Anyway, I thank you all for this gesture, which is<br/>warmly appreciated.</p><p>When I moved from Chicago to Los Angeles in 1979, I<br/>expected that there would be more opportunities for<br/>microtonal activity.  However, the birth of my<br/>daughter a year later required setting priorities that<br/>resulted in quite the opposite (for which I have<br/>absolutely no regrets).  By the time our family moved<br/>back to the Midwest in 1987, my microtonal activity<br/>had virtually ceased.</p><p>About four years ago I realized that life was passing<br/>by, and it seemed that all of the time and effort that<br/>I had put into that pile of papers, still packed in a<br/>couple of cardboard boxes, was going to be lost if I<br/>didn&#xFFFD;t start doing something soon.  Within a year I<br/>began work on a book, using my lunch time to type into<br/>the computer between bites, and, at the present rate,<br/>it will be at least another couple of years before it<br/>will be completed.</p><p>Life is short, our days are numbered, and one never<br/>knows what a day may bring forth, so I think it unwise<br/>to wait until completion of the book to share some of<br/>those nuggets of buried treasure that lie in that pile<br/>of papers that I have produced.  I will therefore be<br/>digging through these and posting some of the things<br/>that I uncover from time to time.  (There is a<br/>considerable amount of paper that deserves to remain<br/>buried, and the perspective that comes with the<br/>passage of time has made it a relatively simple matter<br/>to separate the gems from the glass.)  These postings<br/>will be written in the style of a newspaper column and<br/>will be easily identified by the subject line<br/>beginning with the characters *BT* for the column<br/>name, *Buried Treasure*.</p><p>In the next week or two I will also try to make some<br/>comments and answer a few questions that were raised<br/>in connection with my discovery of the Miracle tuning,<br/>the secor generator, the decimal keyboard geometry (as<br/>I now call it), and the mapping thereon of Harry<br/>Partch&#xFFFD;s monophonic fabric.</p><p>One of these can be dealt with immediately.  It was<br/>noted that I didn&#xFFFD;t discover any of the moment of<br/>symmetry (MOS) scales, such as &#xFFFD;blackjack&#xFFFD; and<br/>&#xFFFD;canasta,&#xFFFD; that are associated with the Miracle<br/>tuning.  (May I commend you on the choice of such<br/>colorful and memorable names.)  The reason that I<br/>didn&#xFFFD;t mention any MOS scales is quite simple: The<br/>term did not appear in print (to the best of my<br/>knowledge) until Erv Wilson presented the concept in<br/>two articles in the very same issue of Xenharmonikon<br/>that contained my article about the Miracle generator<br/>and keyboard.</p><p>I will also have a couple of major presentations to<br/>make of ideas that I have come up with in the past<br/>year.  One of these is a first-rate 72-EDO practical<br/>notation (5 months in the making and downwardly<br/>compatible with both 31-EDO and 41-EDO) that I believe<br/>is much better than anything any of us could ever have<br/>hoped for.  If there are any doubts, just ask Margo<br/>Schulter, who kindly gave me feedback about it in<br/>December, during the last month of its development.<br/>(That&#xFFFD;s your cue, Margo!)</p><p>Of course, now that I have officially joined the<br/>Tuning List dialogue, any new questions or comments<br/>will also be welcome.</p><p>And until next time, please stay tuned!

How<br/>wonderful to have this meeting of microtonal generations, a gathering<br/>in which I joyously share even if some people might argue that my own<br/>tastes are a few centuries off in one direction or another.</p><p>For me, while the excitement this last Spring certainly made me<br/>interested in your xenharmonic adventures and contributions, it was<br/>learning about your 17-note well-temperament of 1978 that especially<br/>moved me to admiration and wonder: here was a system, devised 20 years<br/>before I become involved with this microtonal community, which seemed<br/>custom-designed for me.</p><p>Soon enough, I was not only delighting in your temperament at the<br/>keyboard, but sharing that delight with you as we started to explore<br/>the tuning together.</p><p>From my experience, I can predict that your &quot;Buried Treasures&quot; will<br/>provide to our circle here a convivial feast of flavors -- or of<br/>&quot;moods&quot; or &quot;colors,&quot; to draw upon a tradition to which you and Ivor<br/>Darreg and John Chalmers and others have helped to shape -- well<br/>suited to accord with many diverse appetites for knowledge, wisdom,<br/>and beauty.</p><p>Having had the opportunity to discuss some notational matters with<br/>you, a most educative and ongoing seminar, as I might call it, I look<br/>forward to contributing to any dialogue here from my own viewpoint,<br/>only one of many.</p><p>While this outlook may not necessarily be representative -- at least<br/>for people who aren&apos;t so passionate about mapping 14th-century<br/>European cadences to 13-EDO appropriately &quot;well-timbred&quot; -- I hope<br/>especially to address some questions about how a flexible notation<br/>might be applied to a range of neo-medieval tunings.</p><p>One purpose of a better notation is to promote interchange between<br/>different tunings and performance ensembles: for example, to borrow a<br/>computer programming term, &quot;porting&quot; a piece composed in 31-EDO or a<br/>31-note cycle of 1/4-comma meantone (maybe 31-NEDO, &quot;Nearly Equal<br/>Division of the Octave&quot;) to 72-EDO, or vice versa. How about porting a<br/>neo-medieval piece designed for 29-EDO or 46-EDO or some comparable<br/>regular temperament to 72-EDO -- what commas, maybe pointing in less<br/>familiar directions, await the eager performers of our scenario?</p><p>Interchange issues aside, how might we approach the inflections and<br/>step gradations of a really intricate system, whether from a<br/>neo-medieval viewpoint, some 5-limit or 7-limit JI framework, or maybe<br/>a xenharmonic take on atonality/pantonality or serialism?</p><p>One intriguing example might be 53-EDO, or what I call 53-NEDO, a<br/>Pythagorean cycle with that charming asymmetry of 3.62 cents. That&apos;s<br/>my style: two versions of the same interval differing by a few cents<br/>is a mark of special distinction for a tuning. Whether we take it in<br/>its precisely or &quot;nearly&quot; symmetrical form, 53 gives us no less than<br/>nine commas or tuning steps for each whole-tone, or five for each<br/>regular sharp or flat.</p><p>How might a 5-limit or 7-limit JI user of 53 -- or a neo-medievalist<br/>who takes the regular Pythagorean intervals as a main point of<br/>reference -- approach this intonational &quot;embarrassment of riches&quot;?</p><p>While I leave it to you, George, to share your ideas in the best way,<br/>I can say that there are some exciting approaches you&apos;ve shared with<br/>me that really have me impressed, the kind of approaches which can<br/>make less familiar tunings and styles more accessible as well as<br/>facilitating more dialogue and interchange with fewer artificial<br/>barriers.</p><p>As Willi Apel has written, there&apos;s a subtle interaction between music<br/>and notation. In the era around 1400, six centuries or a bit more ago,<br/>this meant all kinds of refinements regarding the expressing of<br/>rhythmic variations and polymeters: everything from proportions like<br/>those also used to express interval ratios, to red or blue notes and<br/>ways of indicating free syncopation or &quot;written out rubato.&quot;</p><p>While historians have sometimes stressed the sheer intellectual<br/>complexity of some of this theory, we&apos;re also talking about a<br/>tradition of beautiful music, with our intonational refinements of<br/>today also linked to practice which an agreeable notation can help to<br/>expedite as well as to clarify.</p><p>It isn&apos;t a question of either this or that &quot;universal standard&quot; --<br/>we&apos;re too diverse a community for that -- but of more choices for<br/>expressing the unique beauty and logic of a given tuning, possibly<br/>adapted to the stylistic priorities and patterns in a given context,<br/>or for &quot;getting it all together&quot; as xenharmonicists coming from<br/>different outlooks or &quot;notational customs&quot; meet and seek accord,<br/>literal or figurative.</p><p>This is an open seminar, because there are so many beautiful tunings<br/>and questions to explore. With a system like 31-EDO or 31-NEDO, there<br/>are a rich set of historical possibilities going back to Vicentino in<br/>1555, while with neo-medieval systems or others with a large range of<br/>steps and inflections, the precedents may be less abundant.</p><p>For any tuning, however, getting the best blend of new and old -- or<br/>using and possibly translating between systems to accommodate<br/>different types of instruments, notational traditions, or stylistic<br/>outlooks -- is an ongoing project.</p><p>Considering a range of world musical traditions and literatures, rich<br/>with many practices and theories for mapping &quot;interval space,&quot; may<br/>further diversify and enlighten our dialogue, making our colloquy an<br/>exciting global classroom and celebration.</p><p>Ivor Darreg has wisely advised that, when in doubt, don&apos;t worry about<br/>fine points of spelling -- make beautiful music. At the same time, a<br/>&quot;user-friendly&quot; notation, or set of notations tailored to different<br/>tastes or needs, can make the process yet more comprehensible and<br/>rewarding.</p><p>This also raises another matter upon which you can comment with<br/>special acumen and experience as one of the designers of the<br/>Generalized Keyboard Scalatron (along with Erv Wilson and Dick<br/>Harasek): how can the layout of a keyboard affect the way one<br/>approaches both music and notation? People here have taken a special<br/>interest in state-of-the-art keyboards at the opening of a new<br/>century, and the right mixture of experience and enthusiasm could<br/>carry a tradition of such musicians and xenharmonicists as Vicentino,<br/>Colonna (1618), Bosanquet, Fokker, Hanson, and others to new heights.</p><p>What about notation and the building and playing of acoustical<br/>instruments after the tradition of Harry Partch?</p><p>From the Miracle Tuning to your 17-note well-temperament to sundry<br/>&quot;buried treasures&quot; and another outlook on notation, George, I can<br/>predict that we&apos;re in for a real treat.</p><p>Welcome, George, to the Tuning List: let us revel together in the<br/>tuneful concentus of music and community alike.</p><p>In peace, joy, and harmony,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/2002 1:23:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: M.

In the era around 1400, six centuries or a bit more ago,<br/>&gt; this meant all kinds of refinements regarding the expressing of<br/>&gt; rhythmic variations and polymeters: everything from proportions like<br/>&gt; those also used to express interval ratios, to red or blue notes and<br/>&gt; ways of indicating free syncopation or &quot;written out rubato.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While historians have sometimes stressed the sheer intellectual<br/>&gt; complexity of some of this theory, we&apos;re also talking about a<br/>&gt; tradition of beautiful music, with our intonational refinements of<br/>&gt; today also linked to practice which an agreeable notation can help to<br/>&gt; expedite as well as to clarify.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It isn&apos;t a question of either this or that &quot;universal standard&quot; --<br/>&gt; we&apos;re too diverse a community for that -- but of more choices for<br/>&gt; expressing the unique beauty and logic of a given tuning, possibly<br/>&gt; adapted to the stylistic priorities and patterns in a given context,<br/>&gt; or for &quot;getting it all together&quot; as xenharmonicists coming from<br/>&gt; different outlooks or &quot;notational customs&quot; meet and seek accord,<br/>&gt; literal or figurative.</p><p>It&apos;s great to read all of this, Margo.  Thanks so much for the<br/>valuable input you give to medieval music topics.</p><p>While reading this, I couldn&apos;t get away from thoughts about my goals<br/>for a more accurate representation of music.  I&apos;ve had many strong<br/>arguments with Brian McLaren (in writing, and face-to-face) about the<br/>relevance of lattice diagrams and the whole concept of representing<br/>pitches in &quot;ratio space&quot;, but ultimately the whole point of it is<br/>to create an easier way for *me* (and like-minded others) to understand<br/>what might be rather complex mathematical relationships among tones.</p><p>Bound up in this is my concept of finity, and while I&apos;m very excited<br/>about the developments in periodicity-block theory which have been<br/>happening over at tuning-math lately (thanks, Gene!), it&apos;s nice to<br/>know that musicians 600 years ago were successfully coming to terms<br/>with this kind of thing, as well as with problems of rhythmic<br/>notation!

It&apos;s a rather complicated story,<br/>&gt; but to put it briefly, I stumbled across these things<br/>&gt; (working alone without a computer or even a scientific<br/>&gt; calculator) while seeking ways in which to group EDO&apos;s<br/>&gt; into families according to generating intervals other<br/>&gt; than the perfect fifth.

It will come as no surprise that your MIRACLE system<br/>comes out as exceedingly accurate for its level of complexity for<br/>both the 7-limit and the 11-limit, though perhaps not as stellar in<br/>the 9-limit. Another system that shows up as &quot;real special&quot; (in the 7-<br/>limit) for its level of complexity (a lower one) is one I published<br/>in Xenharmonikon 17, which has a generator of about 708 cents and a<br/>period of 600 cents -- and is thus expressed quite accurately in 22-<br/>tET (I especially advocate certain 10-tone-per-octave subsets).

It is to leave behind the<br/>territorial personality. A genius does not have a mind<br/>full of thoughts but is the thinker of thoughts, and<br/>is the center of a field of vision. It is a field of<br/>vision, however, that is recognizable as a field of<br/>vision only when we see that it includes within itself<br/>the original centers of other fields of vision.</p><p>This does not mean that I can see what you see. On the<br/>contrary, *it is because I cannot see what you see that<br/>I can see at all*. The discovery that you are the<br/>unrepeatable center of your own vision is simultaneous<br/>with the discovery that I am the center of my own. &gt;&gt;</p><p>&lt;&lt; Just as the titles of winners are worthless unless<br/>they are visible to others, there is a kind of anti-<br/>title which attaches to invisibility. To the degree<br/>that we are invisible we have a past which has<br/>condemned us to oblivion. It is as though we have<br/>somehow been overlooked, even forgotten, by our chosen<br/>audience. If it is the winners who are presently<br/>visible, it is the losers who are invisibly past.</p><p>As we enter into finite play - not playfully, but<br/>seriously - we come before an audience conscious<br/>that we bear the antititles of invisibility. We feel<br/>the need, therefore, to prove to them that we are not<br/>what we think they think we are or, more precisely,<br/>that we were not who we think the audience thinks<br/>we were.</p><p>As with all finite play, an acute contradiction<br/>quickly develops at the heart of this attempt.<br/>As finite players we will not enter the game with<br/>sufficient desire to win unless we are ourselves<br/>convinced by the very audience we intend to convince.<br/>That is, *unless we believe we actually are the losers<br/>the audience sees us to be, we will not have the<br/>necessary desire to win*. The more negatively we assess<br/>ourselves, the more we strive to reverse the negative<br/>judgement of others. The outcome brings the contra-<br/>diction to perfection: by proving to the audience that<br/>they were wrong, we prove to ourselves the audience was<br/>right.</p><p>The more we are recognized as winners, the more we<br/>know ourselves to be losers. That is why it is rare<br/>for the winners of highly coveted and publicized prizes<br/>to settle for their titles and retire. Winners,<br/>especially celebrated winners, must prove repeatedly<br/>that they are winners. The script must be played over<br/>and over again. Titles must be defended by new contests.</p><p>So crucial is this power of the past to finite play<br/>that we must find ways of remembering that we have<br/>been forgotten to sustain our interest in the struggle.<br/>There is a humiliating memory at the bottom of all<br/>serious conflicts. &quot;Remember the Alamo!&quot;, &quot;Remember<br/>the Maine!&quot;, &quot;Remember Pearl Harbor!&quot;. These are the<br/>cries that carried Americans into several wars. Having<br/>once been insulted by Athens, the great Persian Emperor<br/>Darius renewed his appetite for war by having a page<br/>follow him about to whisper in his ear, &quot;Sire, remember<br/>the Athenians!&quot;.</p><p>Indeed, it is only remembering what we have forgotten<br/>that we can enter into competition with sufficient<br/>intensity to be able to forget we have forgotten<br/>the character of all play: Whoever *must* play<br/>cannot *play*. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Playfully,  J Gill    :)</p></div><h3>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 9:07:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;M.

How<br/>&gt; wonderful to have this meeting of microtonal generations, a<br/>gathering<br/>&gt; in which I joyously share even if some people might argue that my<br/>own<br/>&gt; tastes are a few centuries off in one direction or another.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For me, while the excitement this last Spring certainly made me<br/>&gt; interested in your xenharmonic adventures and contributions, it was<br/>&gt; learning about your 17-note well-temperament of 1978 that especially<br/>&gt; moved me to admiration and wonder: here was a system, devised 20<br/>years<br/>&gt; before I become involved with this microtonal community, which<br/>seemed<br/>&gt; custom-designed for me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Soon enough, I was not only delighting in your temperament at the<br/>&gt; keyboard, but sharing that delight with you as we started to explore<br/>&gt; the tuning together.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From my experience, I can predict that your &quot;Buried Treasures&quot; will<br/>&gt; provide to our circle here a convivial feast of flavors -- or of<br/>&gt; &quot;moods&quot; or &quot;colors,&quot; to draw upon a tradition to which you and Ivor<br/>&gt; Darreg and John Chalmers and others have helped to shape -- well<br/>&gt; suited to accord with many diverse appetites for knowledge, wisdom,<br/>&gt; and beauty.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having had the opportunity to discuss some notational matters with<br/>&gt; you, a most educative and ongoing seminar, as I might call it, I<br/>look<br/>&gt; forward to contributing to any dialogue here from my own viewpoint,<br/>&gt; only one of many.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While this outlook may not necessarily be representative -- at least<br/>&gt; for people who aren&apos;t so passionate about mapping 14th-century<br/>&gt; European cadences to 13-EDO appropriately &quot;well-timbred&quot; -- I hope<br/>&gt; especially to address some questions about how a flexible notation<br/>&gt; might be applied to a range of neo-medieval tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One purpose of a better notation is to promote interchange between<br/>&gt; different tunings and performance ensembles: for example, to borrow<br/>a<br/>&gt; computer programming term, &quot;porting&quot; a piece composed in 31-EDO or a<br/>&gt; 31-note cycle of 1/4-comma meantone (maybe 31-NEDO, &quot;Nearly Equal<br/>&gt; Division of the Octave&quot;) to 72-EDO, or vice versa. How about<br/>porting a<br/>&gt; neo-medieval piece designed for 29-EDO or 46-EDO or some comparable<br/>&gt; regular temperament to 72-EDO -- what commas, maybe pointing in less<br/>&gt; familiar directions, await the eager performers of our scenario?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interchange issues aside, how might we approach the inflections and<br/>&gt; step gradations of a really intricate system, whether from a<br/>&gt; neo-medieval viewpoint, some 5-limit or 7-limit JI framework, or<br/>maybe<br/>&gt; a xenharmonic take on atonality/pantonality or serialism?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One intriguing example might be 53-EDO, or what I call 53-NEDO, a<br/>&gt; Pythagorean cycle with that charming asymmetry of 3.62 cents. That&apos;s<br/>&gt; my style: two versions of the same interval differing by a few cents<br/>&gt; is a mark of special distinction for a tuning. Whether we take it in<br/>&gt; its precisely or &quot;nearly&quot; symmetrical form, 53 gives us no less than<br/>&gt; nine commas or tuning steps for each whole-tone, or five for each<br/>&gt; regular sharp or flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How might a 5-limit or 7-limit JI user of 53 -- or a neo-medievalist<br/>&gt; who takes the regular Pythagorean intervals as a main point of<br/>&gt; reference -- approach this intonational &quot;embarrassment of riches&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While I leave it to you, George, to share your ideas in the best<br/>way,<br/>&gt; I can say that there are some exciting approaches you&apos;ve shared with<br/>&gt; me that really have me impressed, the kind of approaches which can<br/>&gt; make less familiar tunings and styles more accessible as well as<br/>&gt; facilitating more dialogue and interchange with fewer artificial<br/>&gt; barriers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As Willi Apel has written, there&apos;s a subtle interaction between<br/>music<br/>&gt; and notation. In the era around 1400, six centuries or a bit more<br/>ago,<br/>&gt; this meant all kinds of refinements regarding the expressing of<br/>&gt; rhythmic variations and polymeters: everything from proportions like<br/>&gt; those also used to express interval ratios, to red or blue notes and<br/>&gt; ways of indicating free syncopation or &quot;written out rubato.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While historians have sometimes stressed the sheer intellectual<br/>&gt; complexity of some of this theory, we&apos;re also talking about a<br/>&gt; tradition of beautiful music, with our intonational refinements of<br/>&gt; today also linked to practice which an agreeable notation can help<br/>to<br/>&gt; expedite as well as to clarify.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It isn&apos;t a question of either this or that &quot;universal standard&quot; --<br/>&gt; we&apos;re too diverse a community for that -- but of more choices for<br/>&gt; expressing the unique beauty and logic of a given tuning, possibly<br/>&gt; adapted to the stylistic priorities and patterns in a given context,<br/>&gt; or for &quot;getting it all together&quot; as xenharmonicists coming from<br/>&gt; different outlooks or &quot;notational customs&quot; meet and seek accord,<br/>&gt; literal or figurative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is an open seminar, because there are so many beautiful tunings<br/>&gt; and questions to explore. With a system like 31-EDO or 31-NEDO,<br/>there<br/>&gt; are a rich set of historical possibilities going back to Vicentino<br/>in<br/>&gt; 1555, while with neo-medieval systems or others with a large range<br/>of<br/>&gt; steps and inflections, the precedents may be less abundant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For any tuning, however, getting the best blend of new and old -- or<br/>&gt; using and possibly translating between systems to accommodate<br/>&gt; different types of instruments, notational traditions, or stylistic<br/>&gt; outlooks -- is an ongoing project.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Considering a range of world musical traditions and literatures,<br/>rich<br/>&gt; with many practices and theories for mapping &quot;interval space,&quot; may<br/>&gt; further diversify and enlighten our dialogue, making our colloquy an<br/>&gt; exciting global classroom and celebration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ivor Darreg has wisely advised that, when in doubt, don&apos;t worry<br/>about<br/>&gt; fine points of spelling -- make beautiful music. At the same time, a<br/>&gt; &quot;user-friendly&quot; notation, or set of notations tailored to different<br/>&gt; tastes or needs, can make the process yet more comprehensible and<br/>&gt; rewarding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This also raises another matter upon which you can comment with<br/>&gt; special acumen and experience as one of the designers of the<br/>&gt; Generalized Keyboard Scalatron (along with Erv Wilson and Dick<br/>&gt; Harasek): how can the layout of a keyboard affect the way one<br/>&gt; approaches both music and notation? People here have taken a special<br/>&gt; interest in state-of-the-art keyboards at the opening of a new<br/>&gt; century, and the right mixture of experience and enthusiasm could<br/>&gt; carry a tradition of such musicians and xenharmonicists as<br/>Vicentino,<br/>&gt; Colonna (1618), Bosanquet, Fokker, Hanson, and others to new<br/>heights.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about notation and the building and playing of acoustical<br/>&gt; instruments after the tradition of Harry Partch?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From the Miracle Tuning to your 17-note well-temperament to sundry<br/>&gt; &quot;buried treasures&quot; and another outlook on notation, George, I can<br/>&gt; predict that we&apos;re in for a real treat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Welcome, George, to the Tuning List: let us revel together in the<br/>&gt; tuneful concentus of music and community alike.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In peace, joy, and harmony,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; mschulter@v...</p><p>Margo, you&iexcl;&brvbar;re amazing!  I expected a few kind words expressing how<br/>really neat my new notation turned out, after I worked so long and so<br/>hard on it to get all of the details just right, finally reaching the<br/>point where I felt that I could improve it no further.  (I guess<br/>they&iexcl;&brvbar;re in there somewhere, if anyone looks hard enough.)  Although I<br/>do appreciate your noting the possibility of its being &iexcl;&sect;ported&iexcl;&die; from<br/>one division of the octave to another (with the implication that many<br/>things written in 72 could be sight-read directly into 31 or 41),<br/>what happened to the sort of comments you made privately to me?  Such<br/>as:</p><p>12/4/01 &iexcl;V &lt;&lt; Although often the better part of valor is to defer<br/>expressing opinions about tunings until I have actually tried them, I<br/>would say that the idea of a new and unified notation for a Secorian<br/>realization of Partch&apos;s system (or a subset) in 31-ET, 41-ET, or 72-<br/>ET looks like a refreshing and very useful approach, a different way<br/>of viewing the notes and the notation. Representing the Didymus&apos; and<br/>Archytas&apos; [i.e., septimal, 64:63] commas by those flags is what I&apos;d<br/>call an elegant refinement. &gt;&gt;</p><p>And after I sent what has become the final version of the notation,<br/>which incorporated a reworking of the symbols to make them much more<br/>legible:</p><p>12/24/01 - &lt;&lt; Please let me celebrate this Christmas Eve by letting<br/>you know how beautiful your new sagittal notation is: it&apos;s coming<br/>together for me, and the ingenuity of it is something that I&apos;ll write<br/>about more in the next couple of days, including how intuitive it<br/>looks to me for 1/4-comma meantone or 31-ET. &gt;&gt;</p><p>And, as promised, the comments a couple of days later:</p><p>12/26/01 - &lt;&lt; I agree with your daughter: the bolder look is very<br/>attractive, and readable, with very easy pattern recognition for the<br/>regular sharps and flats, and also the semisharps and semiflats. &iexcl;K<br/>Most important here is that the main alterations (sharps, flats, and<br/>semi-sharps or semi-flats) are very quickly recognizable. Being able<br/>to pick out these principal forms quickly makes the notation<br/>practical and also &iexcl;&sect;downward compatible&iexcl;&die; in a very pleasant way.</p><p>&iexcl;K This version maybe crossed a critical line for me: I find myself<br/>thinking it a little, testing expectations and learning through the<br/>process, and making it my own &iexcl;X anyway, I&apos;m on the other side of the<br/>line now, not only admiring the system but drawn into it. I&apos;d be<br/>ready at any appropriate time to advocate this system on the Tuning<br/>List, because it&apos;s coherent, unified, practical, and intuitive &iexcl;X<br/>maybe even more so for people who tend to focus on visual patterns<br/>like those Bosanquet arrows rather than &iexcl;&sect;explain&iexcl;&die; them in terms of<br/>the theory of commas.</p><p>To put the appeal into words, I&apos;d say it&apos;s a very logical and<br/>attractive map of 72-ET, with each  semi-alteration of 3a72 [3<br/>degrees of 72; that special character is a degree symbol] subdivided<br/>into a Didymus and an Archytas comma. There&apos;s been some discussion on<br/>the Tuning List about the idea that lots of musicians (at least<br/>relatively speaking) are familiar with 24-ET and quartertones: the<br/>comma signs could be taken as a further refinement. A key point is<br/>that your basic semi-alteration signs provide a most engaging<br/>standard in themselves, say for noting 17 in &iexcl;&sect;enharmonic&iexcl;&die; style, or,<br/>of course, 31.</p><p>The argument I&apos;d make [to those on the Tuning List about the approach<br/>taken by this notation] is that if we really want a powerful 72-ET<br/>notation, why not build it &iexcl;&sect;from the ground up,&iexcl;&die; while ingeniously<br/>incorporating or paralleling lots of traditional symbols in the<br/>process? There&apos;s a saying of Einstein that things should be made as<br/>simple as possible, but no simpler. &gt;&gt;</p><p>After a testimonial like that, I wonder if is there anybody else out<br/>there who might be interested in seeing it?</p><p>In closing, thanks for your warm welcome.  I look forward to the rich<br/>experience of sharing and encouragement with those who hold a common<br/>hope and dream that someday our efforts just might have a chance of<br/>becoming a part of the musical mainstream.</p><p>Until then, stay tuned!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 12:55:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; After a testimonial like that, I wonder if is there anybody else<br/>out<br/>&gt; there who might be interested in seeing it?</p><p>Of course we would!</p></div><h3>robert_wendell &#x3C;BobWendell@technet-inc.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 1:03:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, George! A reference to the above subject in an earlier post<br/>really caught my attention. I notice that 17 P5s come out with a<br/>comma of -66 cents and some change, so 17 fifths just under 4 cents<br/>sharp come right out on 10 octaves. What strikes me as curious about<br/>this is the negative value of the comma as against the positive value<br/>of the syntonic comma. In 17-EDO the thirds are almost neutral. I&apos;m<br/>trying to see how the comma might be distributed in a productive way<br/>in terms of getting nice thirds at least for part of the cycle of<br/>keys.</p><p>I see that we could tune the fifths even sharper to reduce the 33+<br/>cent flatness of the thirds at four steps, and then swing back toward<br/>flatness to compensate, but the 4-step thirds occur at 9 fifths into<br/>the cycle, so we would need more than 9 fifths tuned sharper just to<br/>get more than one third reduced to whatever the value we might<br/>propose and then it would swing back rather quickly toward greater<br/>flatness again as we included the somewhat flatted fifths.</p><p>I wonder what I&apos;m missing here. Is my familiarity with 12-tone well<br/>temperaments causing me to model after them inappropriately? Or is<br/>your 17-tone well temperament even attempting to move in the<br/>direction of approximating just thirds at all?

First I would like to give a little background, after which I<br/>have a question.</p><p>I began working on the saggital notation without knowing what<br/>notations already existed for 72-EDO, so those had absolutely no<br/>influence on its development.  It&apos;s a practical (staff) notation that<br/>consists completely of non-ASCII characters and requires no more than<br/>one symbol to modify a note.  I have read the postings discussing<br/>notation, and absolutely everything that you disliked about the Sims<br/>notation is avoided in the saggital notation, and everything that you<br/>thought desirable in a 72-EDO notation is there.  And more.</p><p>The symbols can be easily (and reasonably) simulated with ASCII<br/>characters (used in combination, with the number of characters<br/>varying, according to the symbol) for text documents and e-mail.<br/>However, I don&apos;t expect that the simulated symbols will be suitable<br/>for lattice diagrams, so you will probably need something else<br/>(either instead or in addition), possibly along the lines of what you<br/>are already using for that purpose (but I also have another<br/>suggestion to make later).</p><p>The symbols work not only for 72, but also for 17, 19, 22, 24, 29,<br/>31, 36, 41, and 48.  (And there are other divisions that I haven&apos;t<br/>mentioned that will probably work.)  By bending the rules a little,<br/>the notation will also work for 46, 53, and 96, unless we agree to<br/>use an alternative approach to the positive tonal systems that will<br/>treat them all in the same way, in which case the only rule-bending<br/>would be for 96.  (I have not completely thought through this<br/>alternative approach, so I am not yet sure that I like it, but it is<br/>something that we could all look at.  This is so new, even to me,<br/>that I haven&apos;t yet had time to consider all of the ramifications.)</p><p>Here&apos;s the question:  If a majority of the group with an interest in<br/>this really likes the saggital notation, might you all consider<br/>changing the existing 72-EDO ASCII notation that you (except for<br/>Monz) have agreed upon recently to something different in order to<br/>make the agreement unanimous?  (I&apos;m trying my best to make us all<br/>happy, Joe.)</p><p>In exchange for your agreeing to this, I would be happy to consider<br/>any suggestions for improving the saggital notation, inasmuch as I<br/>believe that there is always the possibility that someone else can<br/>make something good into something even better.</p><p>One consideration is what to do about the Sims notation,<br/>specifically, should there be two competing system?  My answer is<br/>that the two different notations don&apos;t serve the same constituency,<br/>so they would not really be competing with one another.  The Sims<br/>notation is intended to be used by performers utilizing existing 12-<br/>EDO instruments for music that is largely atonal (if I understand the<br/>situation properly).  The saggital notation is most suitable for<br/>those who believe in building acoustic instruments specially designed<br/>for alternate tunings or in creating computer-generated (pitch-bent)<br/>MIDI files.  Here we are interested principally in music using prime<br/>numbers beyond the 5 limit.  In cases where instrumentalists fluent<br/>with the Sims notation desire to participate with those preferring<br/>the saggital notation, all that woudl need to be done is to ensure<br/>that each musician has a part available in one&apos;s notation of choice.<br/>(In addition, we will find that with the saggital notation we can<br/>maintain a link back to long-held notational precedents established<br/>by the quartertone composers.)</p><p>It is a significant accomplishment that we have managed to agree that<br/>72-EDO will be the system of choice on which to base our master<br/>notation, whichever that may be.  I feel that this should be a cause<br/>for celebration and a common ground on which we can cooperate with<br/>the Boston Microtonal Society, while continuing to respect each<br/>other&apos;s individual differences, even as we respect and honor (and<br/>should celebrate) diversity within our own ranks.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2002 2:40:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s the question:  If a majority of the group with an interest<br/>in<br/>&gt; this really likes the saggital notation, might you all consider<br/>&gt; changing the existing 72-EDO ASCII notation that you (except for<br/>&gt; Monz) have agreed upon recently to something different in order to<br/>&gt; make the agreement unanimous?
