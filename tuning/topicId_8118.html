That&apos;s not agreement, that is you telling someone they don&apos;t<br/>belong here. Either that or just expressing your own inability to<br/>comprehend why a person would join the list in the first place, which is of<br/>no interest. You then later direct to me:</p><p>&gt;Apparently, Jon, you didn&apos;t even read the message I was replying to</p><p>Sorry, my friend, but I would never enter into something like this if I<br/>*hadn&apos;t* read it, and it is presumptuous and insulting for you to suggest<br/>otherwise. It is also clear that your own demeanor comes across this way to<br/>others, as witnessed by the post from John Link.</p><p>Paul, you might be under the impression that this has become your list by<br/>virtue of the sheer number of posts you make to it. If so, you are wrong.<br/>Please follow your *own* advice and keep the tone civil.

Jon has decided that that is &quot;Bull****&quot;, but it&apos;s true. I lowered<br/>myself to Dale&apos;s level, out of impatience with his outburst. If anyone took<br/>my response as anything else, I am truly sorry. By no means would I ever<br/>advocate the view that someone doesn&apos;t belong on this list unless that<br/>person has been creating a hostile environment.</p><p>Jon wrote,</p><p>&gt;Or at the very<br/>&gt;least, read your posts and responses a few times before hitting the send<br/>&gt;button.</p><p>You&apos;re right, Jon. There&apos;s no reason I couldn&apos;t have responded politely the<br/>way Darren did. I guess I got caught up in the heat of the argument. For<br/>that, I am sorry. Two wrongs don&apos;t make one right.</p><p>Pat wrote,</p><p>&gt;when you make like thirty posts a night<br/>&gt;eventually you are gonna tick someone off.</p><p>I was sick in bed for a week and did my best to catch up. Sorry for being so<br/>grouchy.

That is a big<br/>problem for our posts and the multitude of interpretations that reading a<br/>post engenders.</p><p>However, since e-mail is different from everything else, I think I want to<br/>disagree with Monzo&apos;s zealous hope for heavy editing.  In the pursuit of<br/>perfection, there are many media better suited than e-mail.  The spontaneity<br/>is much of the excitement.  It&apos;s improvisation for me, rather than<br/>composition.</p><p>For the record, I don&apos;t care for multiple posts.  Also, I note some crocodile<br/>tears on the list, too.  It is clear that we are all interested in pitch<br/>related phenomena, but even with dictionary building, we really don&apos;t agree<br/>at all about some of the most significant terms.</p><p>The list is a special place for us all because it allows people to speak to<br/>each other who might never have had contact otherwise.  Consonance is a great<br/>ideal, but dissonance is much more common.  I hope we on the list can handle<br/>the recurring dissonance.  It&apos;s usually just a misunderstanding resulting in<br/>frustration.  Since we all mean well, lets move on.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2000 5:35:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Johnny Reinhard, TD 514.22]<br/>&gt; since e-mail is different from everything else, I think<br/>&gt; I want to disagree with Monzo&apos;s zealous hope for heavy editing.<br/>&gt; In the pursuit of perfection, there are many media better<br/>&gt; suited than e-mail.
