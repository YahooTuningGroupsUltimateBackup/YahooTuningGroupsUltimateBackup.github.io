Along with Hurdy Gurdy he also<br/>made lap organs tuned to historical temperments. He is also well known<br/>for being Ralph Kellog of the band Blue Cheer and produced some of the<br/>very first punk albums coming out of LA at his Radio Tokyo studios. Blag<br/>Flag , the minutemen, the germs, Bangles all began in his studio. I had<br/>shared bills with him over the years and although had lost contact with<br/>him in the last few years always considered him one of LA more<br/>interesting music makers<br/>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div>
