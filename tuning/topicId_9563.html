It&apos;s at:  <a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal/">http://home.att.net/~microtonal/</a></p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Well, that certainly nipped my idea in the bud.  Turns out my current keyboard (Alesis QS8) isn&apos;t on the list.  I guess I&apos;m going to have to sink some more money into this before I can start experimenting.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>Well, it&apos;s really not all that difficult to refret a guitar yourself, as long as you have a typical handyman-like skill and have a Luthier&apos;s Merchantile catalog (800) 477-4437), and know how to perform a few pretty simple calculations.  I suggest you start with a cheapie guitar that you can &quot;throw away&quot; (more likely figuratively speaking than literally) as a first-try learning experience.  That is, if you&apos;re into $1000 guitars, I suggest doing a cheaper one first.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>Ok, this makes sense to me, and I&apos;m always willing to try something new.  Here&apos;s a question though.  Even on quite nice, carefully set up guitars that I might play, I occasionally fine one, or several frets that aren&apos;t positioned quite right and the intonation just makes me cringe.  Cheap guitars are even worse.  So if people who do this professionally can&apos;t get it right, what are the chances that I&apos;m going to get anywhere close?</p></div><h3><a id=9571 href="#9571">ðŸ”—</a>pvallad1@tampabay.rr.com</h3><span>4/15/2000 12:33:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 09:21 AM 4/15/00 -0700, you wrote:<br/>&gt;      <a href="http://home.att.net/~microtonal/">http://home.att.net/~microtonal/</a><br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      I guess I&apos;m going to have to sink  some more money into this<br/>&gt;before I can start experimenting.   &lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>That&apos;s what I thought as well when I first joined this list a couple of<br/>months ago.  Daniel Wolf was kind enough to mention Polyhedric Software at<br/><a href="http://www.polyhedric.com/software/index.html">http://www.polyhedric.com/software/index.html</a>.  They offer synthesis,<br/>audio-editing, sample-playback, and related shareware.  Since I already<br/>have a PC with a decent soundcard, this seemed like a nice, low-cost<br/>solution to me.  I have also just become aware today (while looking for a<br/>metronome app for my Palm Pilot after my &quot;real&quot; metronome broke down) that<br/>there are some brave souls out there working on music stuff for that<br/>device.  Nothing specificially microtonal yet as far as I can tell, other<br/>than a realtime Theremin app, but I&apos;ll keep watching that scene to see what<br/>folks come up with.</p><p>I also took up a very microtone-friendly instrument (the cello), although I<br/>had other, more important reasons for _that_ endeavor.</p><p>Paolo</p></div>
