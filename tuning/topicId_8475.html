You might be interested<br/>&gt; enough to wade thru the whole thing; thankfully, Drew Skyfyre<br/>&gt; has put it online at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://members.xoom.com/drew_skyfyre/xe/Hendrix.html">http://members.xoom.com/drew_skyfyre/xe/Hendrix.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I got so into it that I began writing a piece around it;<br/>&gt; my webpage on that is at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/hendrix/hendrix.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/hendrix/hendrix.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; but the coolest part of my piece, so far, is the last<br/>&gt; minute or so of the MIDI link on my &apos;List of Works&apos; page<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/hendrix/hendrix.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/hendrix/hendrix.mid</a><br/>&gt; - the piece is still &apos;under construction&apos;.</p><p>I will put this on my to-do list, Joe. Right now I&apos;m trying to figure how to<br/>mount this mp3 I have ready to share regarding the &quot;high third.&quot; I do<br/>appreciate the information and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll enjoy the trip when I get a<br/>breather. (I&apos;m not sure why I even got into that discussion. I should know<br/>by now that it simply leads to _more discussion. I guess I love it too<br/>much.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul also feels that the 6:7 &apos;sharp 9th&apos; is the most appropriate<br/>&gt; for the &apos;Hendrix chord&apos;; much of his argument was based<br/>&gt; on the mechanics of guitar-playing, and I had to agree with<br/>&gt; him on that, but 16:19 is still my favorite &apos;sharp 9th&apos; in<br/>&gt; this chord, giving 16:20:24:28:38 for the whole pentad.</p><p>Sounds like a good one. But is it alright with you if I call this 6:7 a<br/>&quot;flat 3&quot; instead of a &quot;sharp nine&quot;? :-)</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>Paul H.

However, the _minor_ &quot;ninth&quot;=&quot;second&quot; does often occur over this<br/>scale (when the diminished scale is used), so the logic of jazz nomenclature<br/>is not perfect.</p><p>And, in meantone temperament and thus Fokker&apos;s notation, an augmented sixth<br/>is very close to 6:7 (as close as you like, depending on the exact variety<br/>of meantone).</p></div><h3>Paul H.
