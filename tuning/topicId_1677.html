Did you think about the<br/>3D<br/>&gt;diamond?</p><p>The difficulty with a 3-note harmonic entropy measure is that a<br/>particular ratio may not be in lowest terms by itself but each member of<br/>the ratio may form a lowest-terms ratio with the third note. That means<br/>that any set of mutually exclusive regions, one for each JI triad, that<br/>covers the plane would have to be very weirdly shaped. The triads<br/>themselves form a fractal-like structure on the plane.</p><p>&gt;Anyhow, I really think harmonic entropy is tha bomb.  Thanks for<br/>&gt;coming up with it, Paul!</p><p>You&apos;re welcome, but you should really thank van Eck for writing _J. S.<br/>Bach&apos;s Critique of Pure Music_, where I got the Farey series + Gaussian<br/>model from (I only corrected one error). And thank Yale for having that<br/>book in their library, and for offering an Information Theory course<br/>while I was a senior, which is where I learned to use the probabilistic<br/>definition of entropy. All I really did was apply the latter to the<br/>former, and you can thank &quot;Herb&quot; for giving me that idea (oops, I better<br/>not run for President now). I&apos;ve been sending Joe Monzo some graphs of<br/>harmonic entropy that he&apos;ll put on his website.</p></div>
