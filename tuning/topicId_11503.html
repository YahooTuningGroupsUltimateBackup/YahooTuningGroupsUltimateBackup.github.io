Before responding to questions about<br/>this material, I would like to read it more carefully, and hope to<br/>have a response within the next day or so.</p><p>In the meantone -- the &quot;meantime,&quot; that is -- I might reply to some<br/>comments from Paul Erlich about the use of bold seventh sonorities<br/>around 1600, and the role of tritone tension.</p><p>As to the use seventh sonorities around 1600 with and without<br/>tritones, I would view this practice in terms of the fluid modality<br/>and bold &quot;rhetorical&quot; use of dissonance flourishing in this era,<br/>rather than in terms of &quot;defining a key.&quot; What these sonorities do is<br/>typically at once to underscore a cadential progression and provide a<br/>moment of drama and color, which in vocal music may be associated with<br/>expressive or emotion-charged words.</p><p>Such gestures can occur on various degrees of a mode, and as Carl<br/>Dahlhaus has noted, occur interspersed with progressions which would<br/>not fit a key-based orientation. I might add that these latter<br/>progressions, sometimes based on motion between 5-limit sonorities<br/>guided by traditional 3-limit resolutions (e.g. M3-5 by contrary<br/>motion), give the music much of its beauty, and distinguish it from<br/>later major/minor styles.</p><p>From the standpoint of practice by the time of Corelli (c. 1680), and<br/>of theory by the time of Rameau&apos;s treatise (1722), it is of course<br/>true that many progressions of the 16th and early 17th centuries (such<br/>as those involving tritone resolutions) have become &quot;key-defining&quot;<br/>events. Another way of putting this is that composers and theorists of<br/>the late 17th and 18th centuries have selected, adapted, and reshaped<br/>elements of earlier styles in creating a new set of styles based on<br/>major/minor tonality.</p><p>For Claudio Monteverdi and his brother Giulio Cesare, however, the<br/>bold use of dissonance was one feature of a fluid modal style in which<br/>a composition might combine various modes. Although the Monteverdi<br/>brothers did not mention Nicola Vicentino in defending this style, in<br/>fact Vicentino describes and approves of the mixing of modes both for<br/>&quot;architectural variety,&quot; so to speak, and for expressing the sometimes<br/>shifting emotions of a text.</p><p>While the use of bold seventh sonorities around 1600, with and without<br/>tritones, is an innovation which provoked controversy (most notably<br/>Giovanni Maria Artusi&apos;s famous polemic of 1600 on _The Imperfections<br/>of Modern Music_), the use of tritone resolutions is a standard<br/>feature of 16th-century style as recognized by Vicentino (1555),<br/>Zarlino (1558), Artusi himself, and others. It is the unprepared<br/>seventh, used by Monteverdi with or without a tritone, which is a<br/>dramatic innovation around the end of the 16th century.</p><p>From a Renaissance perspective, tritone resolutions such as a<br/>diminished fifth contracting to a major third (d5-M3) might fit a more<br/>general paradigm of two-voice progressions by stepwise contrary<br/>motion. Other progressions of this kind, borrowed from earlier 3-limit<br/>practice, are m3-1, M3-5, and M6-8, discussed for example by Zarlino.</p><p>In a Gothic 3-limit setting, the diminished fifth or augmented fourth<br/>is curiously unique as the one variety of unstable diatonic interval<br/>which cannot resolve to a stable interval (unison, octave, fifth, or<br/>fourth) by stepwise contrary motion.</p><p>However, by the late 15th century, thirds and sixths have become<br/>pervasive in the texture and are approaching stability; by around<br/>1500, composers such as Josquin des Prez are using them in closing<br/>sonorities.</p><p>Thus a tritone resolution such as d5-M3 or A4-m6 now fits the general<br/>paradigm of &quot;vertical tension resolved by directed contrary motion,&quot;<br/>the third or sixth now serving as a point of full concord and restful<br/>resolution.</p><p>By the mid-16th century, there is a certain distinction in practice<br/>and theory between the tritone (augmented fourth) or diminished fifth<br/>and other intervals regarded as dissonances, specifically seconds and<br/>sevenths, which normally occur either in ornamental contexts or as<br/>suspensions and the like.</p><p>Zarlino notes that the diminished fifth, unlike other dissonances, can<br/>be written &quot;in a single percussion&quot; -- without syncopation -- if it is<br/>followed by a major third.</p><p>Often such a resolution is combined in a multi-voice cadence with the<br/>traditional M6-8 or m3-1 resolution. I term this kind of process of<br/>combining mutually-reinforcing resolutions as &quot;cadence-stacking&quot; or<br/>&quot;progression-stacking.&quot; Thus a very popular internal cadence which<br/>might occur on various degrees of a mode is the following, with C4 as<br/>middle C and higher notes showing higher octaves:</p><p>  C5   B4<br/>  F#4  G4<br/>  C4   D4<br/>  A3   G3</p><p>(M6-8 + d5-M3)</p><p>Here the major sixth A3-F#4 expands to the octave in the usual manner,<br/>while the diminished fifth F#4-C5 contracts to the major third G4-B4.</p><p>This kind of progression is routine 16th-century style; Zarlino<br/>remarks that both &quot;ancients&quot; (maybe meaning the Josquin generation)<br/>and &quot;moderns&quot; use it. For example, Antonio Cabezon has a beautiful<br/>organ piece in which this kind of tritone resolution adds color to a<br/>momentary &quot;cadence&quot; on D in the overall context of E Phrygian.</p><p>The most popular multi-voice final cadence of the era, as Zarlino notes,<br/>involves a two-voice progression where an upper voice ascends by a<br/>semitone while the bass falls a fifth or rises a fourth (e.g. M3-8 or<br/>M3-1). In a composer such as Josquin, this progression is often combined<br/>with a traditionan M6-8 or m3-1 resolution:</p><p>   F#4  G4<br/>   D4   D4<br/>   A3   G3<br/>   D3   G2</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-8)</p><p>Here the tenor and soprano have a classic M6-8 resolution, while the<br/>outer two parts move in an M3-8 (actually M10-15) resolution of the<br/>kind described by Zarlino.</p><p>In a variation which becomes more and more common during the early<br/>16th century, this kind of four-voice cadence is modified to permit<br/>arrival at a full 5-limit sonority, Zarlino&apos;s _harmonia perfetta_ or<br/>&quot;complete harmony&quot; featuring &quot;the third-plus-fifth-or-sixth&quot; above the<br/>bass. This results in the following kind of progression:</p><p>   F#4  G4<br/>   D4   D4<br/>   A3   B3<br/>   D3   G2</p><p>   (M3-8)</p><p>Note that the tenor and soprano no longer have a standard M6-8<br/>progression, but rather progress in parallel sixths, arriving at a<br/>sonority including the 10th and 12th (octave extensions of the third<br/>and fifth) above the bass. Here the M3-8 or M10-15 progression between<br/>the outer voices seems to serve as the defining two-voice resolution.</p><p>While bold seventh sonorities with tritones may have come into vogue<br/>during the era of 1590-1600 through a number of processes, including<br/>suspensions and ornamented cadences, we can interestingly derive these<br/>sonorities through a process of &quot;cadence-stacking&quot; which might have<br/>easily occurred in improvised counterpoint. (Claude Palisca has<br/>suggested a possible connecton between some of Monteverdi&apos;s bold<br/>dissonances and such traditions of improvisation.)</p><p>As we have seen, the combination (M6-8 + d5-M3) produces a favorite<br/>internal cadence of the 16th century, while (M6-8 + M3-8) produces a<br/>favorite final cadence.</p><p>What happens, however, if we try combining alll three of these<br/>elementary resolutions at once (M6-8 + M3-8 + d5-M3)? The result, to<br/>be compard with the previous two examples of cadences on G, is<br/>illustrated by the following five-voice cadence:</p><p>      C5   B4<br/>      F#4  G4<br/>      A3   D4<br/>      A3   G3<br/>      D3   G2</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-8 + d5-M3)</p><p>This is actually the conclusion of the final cadence in Monteverdi&apos;s<br/>madrigal _Anima mia perdona_. Note that, if we number the voices in<br/>ascending order, with the bass as &quot;1,&quot; then voices 2 and 4 form a<br/>regular M6-8 resolution; voices 1 and 4 a regular M3-8 (or M10-15)<br/>resolution; and the highest pair of voices a usual d5-M3 resolution.</p><p>However, this cadence-stacking permutation introduces the novel<br/>element of the bold minor seventh or fourteenth, here present between<br/>the outer voices (D3-C5).</p><p>From another perspective, we can also analyze this cadence as a<br/>superimposition or &quot;stacking&quot; of two favorite three-voice cadences<br/>similar to the four-voice cadences we have discussed above. Taken<br/>alone, voices 1, 2, and 4 would form a standard (M6-8 + M3-8) formula<br/>of a kind popular as a final three-voice close in the late 15th and<br/>16th centuries. Voices 2, 4, and 5 would form a typical internal<br/>three-voice cadence of our (M6-8 + d5-M3) variety.</p><p>From this point of view, the formula (M6-8 + M3-8 + d5-M3) -- or more<br/>generally (M3-8 + d5-M3) -- could potentially have arisen at any point<br/>in the 16th century. In practice, however, the usual conventions of<br/>dissonance treatment evidently &quot;selected against&quot; permutations<br/>involving a bold seventh -- until new tastes around 1600 selected in<br/>favor of this musical &quot;mutation,&quot; to borrow an evolutionary<br/>metaphor.</p><p>In considering such evolutionary possibilities, it is very important<br/>to recognize that the same vertical event may have different meanings<br/>in different historical and stylistic settings.</p><p>Thus in the musical world of Western Europe around 1600, bold seventh<br/>combinations either with or without tritones were part of a fluid<br/>modal style featuring many &quot;rhetorical figures&quot; of chromaticism and<br/>dissonance, etc.</p><p>By 1700, however, some of these same progressions had been<br/>incorporated into a different scheme of music based on major and minor<br/>keys, codified by Rameau starting in 1722.</p><p>Through these changes, some interesting evolutionary ties may<br/>remain. Thus a 20th-century theorist such as Leonard Ratner explains a<br/>simple three-voice version of a tritonic seventh resolution, e.g.</p><p>F4  E4<br/>B3  C4<br/>G3  C3</p><p>as combining two events: the d5-M3 resolution between the upper parts,<br/>and the descent of the bass by a fifth (in this key-based context,<br/>from dominant to tonic or &quot;5-1&quot;).</p><p>Interestingly, these two events (separately) are also features of<br/>favorite 16th-century cadences in theory and practice. Vicentino (1555)<br/>observes that the bass, especially, defines the principal fifths or<br/>fourths of a mode in polyphonic music, likely alluding at least in<br/>part to its typical cadential leaps by a fifth or fourth. Thus the<br/>diverse momentary cadential centers of 16th-century modal style may be<br/>somewhat analogous to later key centers, also reinforced by this kind<br/>of bass motion, although the two systems remain distinct.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
