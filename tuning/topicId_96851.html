I do know this...from what Rahim has said, they are taught the micro tones (quartertones, as Rahim says, but he doesn&apos;t mean 1/4 tones) as they relate to each particular maqam...not so much by studying ratios/etc. It&apos;s great music indeed, and Munir Bashir is a legendary figure...get &quot;Mesopotamia,&quot; it&apos;s on Amazon, a 2 CD set, it&apos;ll blow your shorts...more later...Stickman   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=96979 href="#96979">ðŸ”—</a>Neil Haverstick &#x3C;microstick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2011 10:30:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Whatever you guys are talking about, it has nothing to do with the music of the Arabs/Turks/Persians...best...Stickman</p></div><h3><a id=97068 href="#97068">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2011 6:50:25 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Mar 11, 2011 at 11:27 AM, Neil Haverstick &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Mike...delighted you&apos;ve found Munir Bashir...I am very fortunate; in the last year and a half I&apos;ve become good friends with Rahim Alhaj (<a href="http://www.rahimalhaj.com">www.rahimalhaj.com</a>), a great Iraqi oud maestro, and a long time student of Bashir...he studied with Munir for 6 years at the Baghdad Conservatory.

(They transliterate his last name &quot;Bachir&quot;.) Listening now, and it&apos;s really cool.</p><p>Thanks for the leads!</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jake</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5xqD_t11ig">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5xqD_t11ig</a><br/>&gt;</p></div>
