The orchestration is choir in 14 edo, hang drums in 7, 14, and 21 edo, and percussion. A microtonalist may point out the 7 and 14 edo are subsets of 21 edo Â– however, since each iteration of hang drum used the same score the result is a polytuned interpretation of the hang drum score.</p><p>Oz, this is in some boring typical genre. I just can&apos;t figure out which one. Perhaps Wiccan dances for epileptics? Not sure.</p><p>online viewing / listening is here:<br/><a href="http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=850">http://chrisvaisvil.com/?p=850</a></p><p>full quality video (256MB) is here <a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/video/in_cold_hell_in_thicket.wmv">http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/video/in_cold_hell_in_thicket.wmv</a></p><p>Audio only is here <a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/14-et/IF20110205-acoustic-in-cold-hell-film.mp3">http://micro.soonlabel.com/14-et/IF20110205-acoustic-in-cold-hell-film.mp3</a></p></div>
