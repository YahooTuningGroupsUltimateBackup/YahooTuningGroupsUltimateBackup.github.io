Here I focus mainly on just intonation (JI)<br/>systems, because they are often presented in theory as ideal models<br/>for the inevitably fluid reality of vocal intonation.</p><p>---------------------------------------------<br/>1. &quot;Mental limitation&quot; or artistic selection?<br/>---------------------------------------------</p><p>From a certain point of view, _any_ historical system can be presented<br/>as a case of confining &quot;mental limitations&quot; when compared to some<br/>later system permitting new concordant sonorities or tunings.</p><p>Thus neither medieval 3-limit nor Renaissance-Romantic 5-limit systems<br/>can do justice (intonational or otherwise) to 20th-century musics<br/>based on concordant sonorities including minor sevenths tuned at or<br/>around 7:4.</p><p>In my view, each system has its own &quot;limitations&quot; -- and unique<br/>artistic possibilities. When an interval such as the major third or<br/>minor seventh is treated as a stable concord, this means that it no<br/>longer can carry an unambiguous message of tension or of &quot;more to<br/>come.&quot;</p><p>Of course, there is no way of &quot;proving&quot; that singers of organum around<br/>900, of complex motets around 1300, or of Monteverdi&apos;s madrigals<br/>around 1600 did not &quot;naturally&quot; follow 7-limit JI and &quot;sing those<br/>minor sevenths _in tune_ at 7:4,&quot; regardless of the compositional<br/>style or the intonational side-effects.</p><p>In fact, the recognition that harmonic and intonational systems select<br/>a small subset of all possible sonorities and ratios (integer-based or<br/>otherwise) is a very useful one. However, with musical styles as with<br/>natural languages, such selectivity need not be treated as an<br/>_unnatural_ limitation.</p><p>Gothic, Renaissance, and Romantic music all richly realize different<br/>artstic possibilities. Intonational styles such as medieval 3-limit<br/>and Renaissance 5-limit JI both reflect and enhance the unique musical<br/>values of these eras.</p><p>--------------------------------------<br/>2. Ideal systems and artful deviations<br/>--------------------------------------</p><p>To say that a model such as 3-limit or 5-limit JI aptly represents the<br/>intonational ideal of a given period is not to say that there is no<br/>room for variations. Hypotheses as to such variations should be placed<br/>in the context of a given musical style.</p><p>For example, one hypothesis might propose that singers tend to<br/>&quot;simplify&quot; high odd-limit ratios to relatively lower ones. Thus a<br/>singer around 1300 might &quot;shade&quot; an 81:64 major third toward either<br/>5:4 or 9:7, both &quot;simpler&quot; ratios. This same singer might likewise<br/>shade a 16:9 minor seventh toward 7:4, or possibly 9:5, in cases where<br/>this would not compromise a vertical fourth.</p><p>At the same time, the theoretically standard 81:64 and 16:9 have a<br/>certain attraction also: the first is a pure ditone resulting from two<br/>pure 9:8 whole-tones, while the second results from two pure fourths<br/>at 4:3.</p><p>With a keyboard, as Mark Lindley and others have noted, 3-limit is a<br/>natural solution; in fact, it is arguably the one historical JI system<br/>ideally suited to a fixed-pitch instrument. For singers, the classic<br/>3-limit intervals may be taken as general guides, but with much room<br/>for &quot;artful deviations&quot; in either a 5-limit or a 7-limit direction.</p><p>Then, again, it is easy enough on a meantone keyboard to suggest some<br/>&quot;artful deviations&quot; which _might_ have happened around 1600 in the<br/>intonation of minor sevenths. Consider, for example, this<br/>transposition of a famous (and to me delightful) Monteverdian cadence,<br/>which I show with continuo figures identifying the dissonances:</p><p>     1       2   &amp;  |  1</p><p>    C#4      C4       D4<br/>    Bb3          A3   Bb3<br/>    Eb3      F3       Bb2</p><p>     7       5   -<br/>     5       4   3</p><p>As Dave Hill has demonstrated with 20th-century Blues pieces on his<br/>meantone piano, the augmented sixth Eb3-C#4 in 1/4-comma meantone is<br/>almost identical to a 7:4 minor seventh, while the augmented second<br/>Bb3-C#4 is very close to a 7:6 minor third.</p><p>On such a keyboard, of course, it is easy to show that such intervals<br/>are the exception, with the usual more &quot;dissonant&quot; minor sevenths at<br/>around 1007 cents fitting both the actual notes in compositions of<br/>this epoch, and the theoretical role of the minor seventh as a<br/>dissonance, albeit one now much relished in bold treatments.</p><p>A 7-limit purist might argue that regardless of theories or keyboard<br/>tunings, singers would &quot;naturally&quot; seek the maximum concord of 7:4,<br/>rather than an alternative &quot;a full sixth-tone or more out of tune.&quot;</p><p>From another viewpoint, however, we might consider the possibilities<br/>of such an &quot;artful variation&quot; and the possible consequences for the<br/>rest of the intonational system.</p><p>-------------<br/>3. Conclusion<br/>-------------</p><p>While it may hardly be the going fashion here to praise 12-tone equal<br/>temperament (12-tet), I would like to credit this tuning system with<br/>at least one important achievement.</p><p>The way that modern singers reportedly often tend to approximate 12-tet<br/>intonation even when unaccompanied may suggest that &quot;natural&quot; vocal<br/>intonation may be largely a matter of custom and training.</p><p>This is not to say that 12-tet has a privileged position, any more<br/>than 3-limit or 5-limit or 7-limit. However, from one point of view,<br/>it marks a very reasonable compromise between the vertical urge for<br/>stable major thirds somewhere near 5:4, and the melodic urge for broad<br/>whole-tones somewhere near 9:8 and narrow semitones not too far from<br/>256:243.</p><p>In medieval music where stable major thirds are not a constraint,<br/>singers may lean in polyphony as in chant to a pure ditone (81:64); in<br/>Renaissance music where euphonious thirds are of supreme importance,<br/>singers may lean strongly toward 5:4. It&apos;s an interesting question as<br/>to how singers of the &quot;well-tempered&quot; era (18th-19th century) may have<br/>been influenced by key color schemes on keyboards in shading their<br/>thirds.</p><p>All in all, music history presents a kind of paradox. Any historical<br/>JI system may seem either &quot;dreadfully limited&quot; by comparison with some<br/>higher-limit system, or &quot;amazingly rich and full&quot; by its own standards<br/>as realized in actual compositions. I prefer to take the latter<br/>viewpoint when considering actual historical musics (medieval and<br/>otherwise), and the former when _any_ system is proposed as a uniquely<br/>&quot;natural&quot; or universal alternative.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
