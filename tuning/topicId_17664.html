After a year or two or three, they would<br/>&gt;get to the lesser known jazz greats and everyone wouldn&apos;t feel slighted.<br/>&gt;But if documentries have to be made, someone other than Burns should<br/>&gt;make</p><p>&gt;Jazz II -  Free Jazz: the musicans that Sun Ra, Ornette Coleman, late<br/>&gt;           period John Coltrane and Cecil Taylor influenced. Maybe<br/>&gt;           the likes of Anthony Braxton, ACMM, the whole &quot;Downtown&quot;<br/>&gt;           scene of NYC jazz and free improv could fit in here. Also<br/>&gt;           the European influence, ie Evan Parker, Derek Bailey...</p><p>&gt;Jazz III - Fusion: from Larry Coryell to Miles Davis and his sidemen<br/>&gt;           who became band leaders - John McLaughlin, Chick Corea,<br/>&gt;           Herbie Handcock, and Joe Zawinul, through the &quot;Canterbury&quot;<br/>&gt;           English scene including Soft Machine, Alan Holdsworth and<br/>&gt;           Bill Bruford to its decline as CD-101 Smooth Jazz with the<br/>&gt;           likes of Kenny G. Somewhere in here Pat Metheny and John<br/>&gt;           Scofield could somehow fit in.</p><p>&gt;Jazz IV -  Straight Ahead - All those guys who continue to mine the<br/>&gt;           traditional territory of standards and the dense harmonic<br/>&gt;           vocabulary of chord subs.</p><p>When Ken Burns was interviewed on Charlie Rose, he said that he allots the<br/>last 25 years of jazz history only the last 40 minutes of his film because<br/>not enough time has passed to really deal with this period as &quot;history&quot; --<br/>it&apos;s still a story in the making. And I fully agree. Today we can look back<br/>on the disparate threads of jazz history and see how they all tie to Louis<br/>Armstrong; have a clear, removed perspective from which to compare Duke<br/>Ellington and Count Basie; can view the enthusiasms and critiques of the<br/>swing era with sufficient detachment not to be swept up into the political<br/>and other factors that shaped them, etc. But jazz since 1975 is still too<br/>close to be able to step back and see the big picture.</p></div>
