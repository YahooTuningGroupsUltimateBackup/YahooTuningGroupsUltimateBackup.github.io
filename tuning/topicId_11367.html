It&apos;s an indication of internal coherence.</p><p>Look at this example of 22 indian srutis which follows. Don&apos;t regard at<br/>this as only nice picture but as case of representative evidence which<br/>proceeds of this  W-M-space insertion. Two Partch-like matrix derived from<br/>chordoid theory are included. Complete macrotonal coherence is embedded<br/>only in such matrix.</p><p><a href="http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/india.htm#sh-treillis">http://www.aei.ca/~plamothe/india.htm#sh-treillis</a></p><p>Picture and matrix will be integrated in few days in a text on Classical<br/>Indian System that will find out algebrical structure hidden on indian<br/>srutis. Anomalies (light symmetry breaks) on the set will be explained.</p><p>Pierre Lamothe</p></div>
