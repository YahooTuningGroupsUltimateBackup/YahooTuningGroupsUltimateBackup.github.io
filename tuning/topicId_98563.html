An analogous starting point can be constructed as a basis point<br/>for figuring out 91/90.</p><p>The core concept with 91/90 is that it merges 6:7:9 into 10:13:15, and<br/>thus makes supermajor chords a lot more pleasant. So if we start with<br/>the <a href="http://2.3.7.13/15">2.3.7.13/15</a> subgroup, and just temper out 91/90, we end up with a<br/>rank 3 system analogous to the 5-limit JI lattice, except instead of<br/>dealing with 4:5:6 and its utonal inversion 10:12:15, we&apos;re dealing<br/>with 6:7:9 and its utonal inversion 10:13:15. The three dimensions of<br/>the system can be thought of as 2/1 vs 1/2, 3/2 vs 4/3, and 7/6<br/>(15/13) vs 9/7 (13/10). You can also think of it as 2/1, 3/1, and 7/1,<br/>I guess, but it&apos;s probably more intuitive to think of it the other way<br/>so that you can see the parallels with 5-limit JI.</p><p>So if we start with this planar temperament and just ignore 5 and 11<br/>for the moment, we will probably get some awesome rank-2 temperaments<br/>right away. I think many variants of common 5-limit temperaments will<br/>emerge - e.g. we&apos;ll see one that&apos;s similar to porcupine, except maybe<br/>four generators will land you at 13/10 instead of 4/3 - and we&apos;ll see<br/>one that&apos;s similar to meantone and superpyth, except with really wide<br/>fifths. Then we can also look at extending this lattice into &quot;higher&quot;<br/>primes, except in this case &quot;higher&quot; means things like 5, 11, and 13.</p><p>As for names: the temperament equating 81/80 with 13/10 reminds me of<br/>being outside on a white-sanded beach near a dock, whatever 46-equal<br/>is doing reminds me of being outside on Pandora from Avatar in the<br/>neon jungle, and the semaphore-ish ones remind me of being outside on<br/>an island, which is great because they&apos;re also island temperaments.</p><p>I suggest the name &quot;biome&quot; for the 91/90 <a href="http://2.3.7.13/15">2.3.7.13/15</a> rank-3<br/>temperament, as the word biome describes everything I&apos;ve described<br/>above: a climate and its underlying biosphere. It&apos;s more elegant than<br/>&quot;ecosystem.&quot; Then the ultrapyth temperament in that subgroup that<br/>eliminates 91/90 and 64/63 can be named after a certain biome (&quot;dock&quot;<br/>temperament?), whatever 46-equal is doing can be called &quot;pandora&quot;<br/>temperament, the semaphore-ish ones are already &quot;island&quot; temperament,<br/>and so on. We&apos;re right now calling 91/90 the &quot;xentonic&quot; comma as a<br/>working title, but if anyone comes up with something really elegant<br/>for it let&apos;s change it.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98566 href="#98566">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/24/2011 2:40:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I suggest the name &quot;biome&quot; for the 91/90 <a href="http://2.3.7.13/15">2.3.7.13/15</a> rank-3<br/>&gt; temperament, as the word biome describes everything I&apos;ve described<br/>&gt; above: a climate and its underlying biosphere.

It sounds like<br/>I&apos;m on a desert island, with white sand, and there&apos;s all coral in the<br/>water and stuff, which is bright blue, and everything is extremely<br/>bright. Really bright. The sun is too bright - however, it&apos;s actually<br/>become so bright that it&apos;s spilled over into 10:13:15 territory, where<br/>you discover that the blinding brightness doesn&apos;t hurt your eyes<br/>anymore, once you yield to it and learn to accept it, because the<br/>supermajor triads are consonant! How profound.</p><p>In the sky, you can of course see the earth mother, who is a really<br/>attractive brunette, encouraging you to accept the blinding brightness<br/>and realize that it doesn&apos;t hurt your eyes. That&apos;s my actual<br/>impression, to hell with the dock thing. Not really mediterranean,<br/>maybe &quot;tropical,&quot; but not really that either. This is like mavila&apos;s<br/>happier cousin or something, in that the fifths are sharp instead of<br/>flat, but since they form 10:13:15 triads instead of 14:18:21 it&apos;s not<br/>so bad.</p><p>Anyway, the real takehome point for me is that since this whole<br/>concept is completely xenharmonic, we&apos;re probably going to get lots of<br/>associations that don&apos;t sound like boring old natural regular earth,<br/>so the list of biome names might be too limiting - these are brand new<br/>biomes we&apos;re discovering, after all.</p><p>&gt; &gt; whatever 46-equal is doing can be called &quot;pandora&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If this is the biome clan, shouldn&apos;t we use names of biomes? &quot;Subtropical&quot; maybe, or &quot;rainforest&quot;?</p><p>Biomes all across the universe, yes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; We&apos;re right now calling 91/90 the &quot;xentonic&quot; comma as a<br/>&gt; &gt; working title, but if anyone comes up with something really elegant<br/>&gt; &gt; for it let&apos;s change it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &quot;biome&quot; comma comes to mind as an obvious choice.</p><p>I was thinking that since the theme here seems to be the discovery of<br/>new musical biomes, many of which are tripping me right the hell out,<br/>some kind of name like &quot;new world&quot; comma would be nice, or something<br/>that has to do with explorers, or like you&apos;ve stumbled on a whole new<br/>world of... biomes... or something.</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
