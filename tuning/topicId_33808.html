Murail often<br/>speaks of his &quot;harmonies&quot; as being somewhere in between timbre and<br/>harmony, the desired goal is that the listener not be able to quite tell.<br/> . . well, sometimes it  works.  The chords are usually pretty cool<br/>anyway.</p><p>Transformations might include something like &quot;FM&quot; -- frequency modulation<br/>-- of a certain pitch, which generates a calculable set of sideband<br/>frequencies.      this &quot;modulation&quot; is all done &quot;virtually&quot;, and<br/>orchestral instruments (or chamber group) &quot;play&quot; the &quot;chord or timbre&quot;<br/>produced by the FM.</p><p>Often the composers work in temporal aspects of the analyzed sound as<br/> well. . . for example the way certain partials in a sound decay or attack<br/> or sustain. . .</p><p>One interesting facet of their work is that &quot;extended techniques&quot; like<br/>multiphonics are made far more organic, since the partials produced by a<br/>given multiphonic on a given instrument can become part of the harmonic<br/>fabric of a work. . . .</p><p>anyway, that&apos;s just a little sampler of their technique, from which I&apos;ve<br/>learned a lot. . .</p><p>Having hung out with Murail and his &quot;followers&quot; (students),  the only<br/>thing of which I (and others) complain is a slightly pompous attitude<br/>asserting (put simply) that since their work comes from &quot;the sound itself&quot;<br/>or, &quot;nature&quot;, it&apos;s therefore &quot;better&quot;. . . .  so as I say, I often join the<br/>devil-advocates around school. . . .but nontheless, when push comes to<br/>shove, the music rocks. . .</p></div><h3><a id=33814 href="#33814">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>2/7/2002 8:12:58 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chris,</p><p>Thanks for more background on the spectral folks.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; . . .but nontheless, when push comes to shove, the music rocks. . .</p><p>Yep, and I wish more people shoved in this world.

Now i really look<br/>forward to it! I would imagine that our adaptation to having a movable 12 tone tuning might have<br/>trained us to adjust to acoustical &quot;cues&quot; which would allow such 1/4 and 1/8 tone notation to get<br/>the players close enough to where they might &quot;correct&quot; subconsciously.</p><p>    I would tend to side with them in at least seeing music being based on sound-via acoustical<br/>relationships (any and all though). Most other methods quickly degenerate into conceptual juggling<br/>of unperceptable entities (rows being but one example). Things that look good on paper.</p><p>    The whole argument really is absurd if i take a step back, music based on sound,<br/> how archaic. We don&apos;t have to base it on sound anymore where in the end the measure becomes<br/>nothing more than the level of &quot;cleverness&quot;. Which has its place but can lead  to &quot;shallowness&quot;</p><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>&gt; Having hung out with Murail and his &quot;followers&quot; (students),  the only<br/>&gt; thing of which I (and others) complain is a slightly pompous attitude<br/>&gt; asserting (put simply) that since their work comes from &quot;the sound itself&quot;<br/>&gt; or, &quot;nature&quot;, it&apos;s therefore &quot;better&quot;. . . .  so as I say, I often join the<br/>&gt; devil-advocates around school. . . .but nontheless, when push comes to<br/>&gt; shove, the music rocks. . .</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=33895 href="#33895">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2002 10:14:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_33808.html#33808">/tuning/topicId_33808.html#33808</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; re: Murail, Grisey. . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I forgot to mention something about their technique. . . .</p><p>Thanks, Chris, for this *very* valuable post...</p><p>J.
