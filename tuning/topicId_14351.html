I don&apos;t even like it! Unlike some<br/>microtonalists (notably LaMonte Young) who only use 3 and 7 and higher<br/>primes, I consider 5 an essential part of most tonalities, and I find &quot;my&quot;<br/>temperament&apos;s approximation of it (367 cents; 19 cents flat) unacceptable. 7<br/>is even worse, at either 992 or 943 cents. People say it&apos;s good for<br/>Neo-Gothic music, but I haven&apos;t ever actually heard any, so I can&apos;t have an<br/>opinion. Keep calling it &quot;Pepper&apos;s Temperament&quot; if you like, but I still<br/>don&apos;t like it very much.</p><p>-Keenan P.</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2000 5:48:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Keenan Pepper wrote,</p><p>&gt; I find it somewhat humorous that my little speculation that there<br/>was another noble generator close to 3/2, but on the other side, is<br/>being constantly referred to as &quot;Pepper&apos;s Neo-Gothic Temperament&quot;,<br/>nearly always with a flattering adjective thrown in (those who call it<br/>a &quot;tuning&quot; are forgetting the meaning of that word).
