While I can&apos;t say I disagree with either<br/>&gt;of you, I have worked thru the book (at least a bit) and see<br/>&gt;it as an eminently useful *ear-training* guide.  I think perhaps<br/>&gt;the strongest criticism I can level against the book is that<br/>&gt;it carries the title (&apos;P[r]eliminary Studies in the Virtual<br/>&gt;Pitch-continuum), while aptly vague, could have been more<br/>&gt;meaningful: it should be viewed as a *practical* ear-training<br/>&gt;manual, and not as any kind of theoretical exegis.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if I would have questioned its &quot;theoretical rigor&quot; since it&apos;s<br/>not a theory book, as you say. However, I would certainly make use of the<br/>intervals among the first 12 harmonics as a way of teaching a large<br/>proportion of the 72-tET intervals. This book does not make any reference to<br/>the harmonic series.</p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2000 11:46:57 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul H.

I didn&apos;t mean to misquote you, I was just<br/>basing my comment on my memory of your post a few days ago.</p><p>But I&apos;m pretty sure that their omission of any reference to<br/>harmonics is intentional.  Maneri and Van Duyne in this book seem<br/>to be specifically intent on training their student&apos;s ears to<br/>hear *divisions of the continuum*.  IOW, the 72-tET *notation*<br/>is only an expedient in understanding parts of the continuum that<br/>are &apos;in the cracks&apos; between 12-tET; it is *not* meant to refer<br/>to any kind of rational harmonic underpinning.</p><p>What I found so interesting as I worked on the exercises (as I&apos;ve<br/>already said here twice) is that with my JI background, I couldn&apos;t<br/>*prevent* myself from hearing the intervals as pseudo-JI.  Of<br/>course, this is because 72-tET is such a good approximation to<br/>the ratios and because it&apos;s highly consistent.</p><p>I think I can pretty easily agree with you that the book would<br/>have been enriched by an inclusion of reference to the harmonics.<br/>But the authors are coming from a fundamentally &apos;different place&apos;<br/>than you and I.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div><h3>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2000 11:55:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot; Monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12683">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12683</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think I can pretty easily agree with you that the book would<br/>&gt; have been enriched by an inclusion of reference to the harmonics.<br/>&gt; But the authors are coming from a fundamentally &apos;different place&apos;<br/>&gt; than you and I.</p><p>Hmmm...
