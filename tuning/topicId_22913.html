There are lots of fantastic tunings in here. I&apos;ve<br/>discussed with Gary before that 88cET is really basically<br/>the 8th root of 3:2, as you noted. He does not exactly<br/>agree and likes to keep in at a precise 88.000 cents,<br/>which keeps some other intervals in the scale tuned more<br/>the way he likes them.</p><p>No one has yet brought up, to my awareness, that Alpha,<br/>Beta, Gamma _and_ 88cET -- surely the four most well known<br/>nonoctave tunings -- are all essentially equal divisions<br/>of the fifth.</p><p>This is why I have been dividing other intervals up like<br/>septimal intervals. I started with 88cET, moved through<br/>the Carlos tunings, toyed with various other scales hoping<br/>to get a good fifth and then finally realized that I could<br/>abandon both the fifth and the octave and still write<br/>music that expressed whatever it was I was trying to get<br/>at. That&apos;s when I moved into the equal divisions of<br/>septimal and higher order intervals for the last three or<br/>four years, as I gave some examples of a couple months<br/>back. That&apos;s where it&apos;s really _happening_ for me big time<br/>right now in nonoctave equal temperaments.</p><p>I amused myself earlier this year by making a catalog of<br/>this and I have uploaded it here:</p><p><a href="/tuning/files/Jeff/FIFTHS.HTM">/tuning/files/Jeff/FIFTHS.HTM</a></p><p>Now, please don&apos;t be upset that I named all the unnamed<br/>ones after myself. I do expect that someone will find out<br/>who really first discovered all these, hopfully with dates<br/>of discovery. Anyone who knows, email me and I will update<br/>it.</p><p>This is a real good &apos;reference sheet&apos; to get started in<br/>this area.</p><p>I have often thought of making it the basis of an article<br/>for xenharmonikon and actually do encyclopedia entries for<br/>each of these and so forth but you know I am probably not<br/>going to get around to that anytime soon so hey I&apos;ll just<br/>put in out here and hope it is of use to some people.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I will be stating anything unobvious in<br/>saying that an album with one track from each of these<br/>tunings makes a lot of sense. I plan to do it, but I have<br/>about three other concept albums I want to do queued up<br/>ahead of this project.</p><p>All the best,</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=22933 href="#22933">ðŸ”—</a>Gary Morrison &#x3C;MR88CET@TEXAS.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2001 5:36:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; No one has yet brought up, to my awareness, that Alpha,<br/>&gt; Beta, Gamma _and_ 88cET -- surely the four most well known<br/>&gt; nonoctave tunings -- are all essentially equal divisions<br/>&gt; of the fifth.</p><p>Not to nitpick, and with thanks for the vote of confidence about 88CET, but I suspect that<br/>Bohlen/Pierce tuning is probably better known among nonoctave tunings than 88CET.

A non-octave form of<br/>Blackjack would superimpose this scale with its transposition at a<br/>~5:4.</p></div>
