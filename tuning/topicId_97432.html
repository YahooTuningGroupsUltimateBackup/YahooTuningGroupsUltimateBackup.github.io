I&apos;ll start my question with the article I found:</p><p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110325102008.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110325102008.htm</a></p><p>and the beginning of the text:</p><p>&quot;Researchers at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) of the University of Amsterdam have discovered a universal property of musical scales. Until now it was assumed that the only thing scales throughout the world have in common is the octave.</p><p>The many hundreds of scales, however, seem to possess a deeper commonality: if their tones are compared in a two- or three-dimensional way by means of a coordinate system, they form convex or star-convex structures. Convex structures are patterns without indentations or holes, such as a circle, square or oval.&quot;</p><p>It goes on a bit, although it is pretty short and doesn&apos;t really describe how they mathematically describe this universal property except to say that they used an Euler Lattice, and that through that they found that most scales used in music the world over form star-convex structures.</p><p>I am decent with basic math, but this stuff is a bit outside my experience. Do any of you know what the researchers referenced in this article are talking about? And can you explain it?</p><p>I am curious about this, because I consider myself a wanna-be composer, and if I can find out what this concept actually implies musically, I may find it useful.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2011 7:43:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;bigAndrewM&quot; &lt;bigandrewm@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I am decent with basic math, but this stuff is a bit outside my experience.

In Scala, load a 5-limit scale from the Scala scale directory--for example, ptolemy.scl. Now go to the pull-down menu under Analyze and go to &quot;Lattice and player&quot; on the menu, and show the lattice. Note that you can draw a polygon around the lattice--this is called the convex hull--and that there are no new lattice points inside this polygon. This means the scale is convex.</p><p>Note also that it doesn&apos;t matter whether you choose the square or triangular arrangement of dots--convexity is independent of that sort of thing--it is an &quot;affine&quot; property.</p><p>&gt; I am curious about this, because I consider myself a wanna-be composer, and if I can find out what this concept actually implies musically, I may find it useful.</p><p>It basically implies, musically, that the notes of the scale are linked together in a way which is efficient in terms of allowing for dyads and triads.</p></div><h3>ixlramp &#x3C;ixlramp@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2011 9:32:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi :) Do you understand tonal lattices?</p><p>They took 998 Just Intonation scales from the Scala archive that are formed by combinations of the intervals 3/2, 5/4 and 7/4, and analysed the shapes of the scales as visualised by a tonal lattice.
