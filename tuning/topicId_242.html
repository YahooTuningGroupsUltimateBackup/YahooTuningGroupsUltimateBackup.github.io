To what degree should a musician<br/>&gt;concentrate not only upon *expressing* a musical feeling or idea, but upon<br/>&gt;*conveying* it to an audience?  To what degree have you failed if you&apos;ve<br/>&gt;expressed something with music, but a sufficiently sensitive audience has<br/>&gt;no idea what you&apos;re &quot;talking about&quot;, so to speak?</p><p>I have posted to the list a few times about my feelings on this.  The<br/>bottom line is composers are going to do what they are going to do.  I<br/>personally feel that music is first and foremost a means of communication<br/>(via the sound, not the stage act or advertising), and that so long as you<br/>believe your message is worth the while, you have no responsibility to lead<br/>your audience to it by the nose.</p><p>&gt;All of La Monte&apos;s music is unfortunately out of print.

I make stuff, other people do what they<br/>want with it.</p><p> If it used, or in this case listened to, as I intended, great. Also I<br/>can take some pride in accomplishing my chosen form of commincation.<br/>However there is nothing more refreshing than some one seeing and makeing<br/>some new out of the work I&apos;ve done. It is the type of thing that brings<br/>out new points of veiw I might not see in my work. Also sometimes it is<br/>just a plain old hoot.<br/>  I can&apos;t really how one can &quot;fail&quot;. The best we can do is try and listen<br/>a learn from the audience as much as we try to tell them our story or<br/>idea clearly thru music. Ideally I think it is best to try and achive<br/>both goals. To clearly exspres an idea and still leave room for a listen<br/>to also go with where thay choose.<br/> A friend of mine who is a poet once said, &quot; poets are musicians with no<br/>talent for music.&quot;</p></div><h3>Mark Nowitzky &#x3C;nowitzky@xxxx.xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/10/1999 7:43:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 11:53 AM 1/9/99 -0000, Leigh Smith &lt;<a href="mailto:leigh@cs.uwa.edu.au">leigh@cs.uwa.edu.au</a>&gt; wrote (TD 13 Msg 7):<br/>&gt;Subject: Tuning back digests<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As well as the sad loss of academic support, with the demise of the<br/>&gt;Mills list we seem to have lost access to the tuning list back digests.

Are you trying to communicate with an audience that doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&quot;get&quot; what you&apos;re expressing?  Whose fault would that be?  If you want to<br/>&gt;communicate with others, then communicate with them, music and all.  If you<br/>&gt;want to make and hear sounds for yourself, have fun, and don&apos;t worry if an<br/>&gt;audience doesn&apos;t know what you&apos;re &quot;talking about.&quot;</p><p>Sometimes one has music to express that simply cannot be communicated to<br/>an unprepared audience. Iannis Xenakis for the Masses? Na ga da. Like<br/>mathematics, some things are appropriate for a mass audience<br/>(recreational math), some are incomprehensible to all but a few<br/>specialists (braided geometries), and most cover all gradations in<br/>between.
