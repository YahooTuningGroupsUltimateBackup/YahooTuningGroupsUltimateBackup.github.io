I may not be up to<br/>date on the current installation, but I remember the fundamental being<br/>considered to be 15 Hertz. The highest pitches in the complex thus have<br/>very short wave lengths - the slightest move of the head causes an<br/>encounter with the next wave front. The sine waves are in phase. Young<br/>prefers his Amplitudes in an inverse relationship to frequency<br/>(Fletcher-Munsen ignored), but I am not sure how exactly the Rayna is able<br/>to do this.</p></div><h3>Patrick Pagano &#x3C;ppagano@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>1/28/1999 5:24:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Carter I think Mr. Beardsley is your man.<br/>But i am pretty sure they are frequencies. Im running 2224 right now on a HP<br/>frequency synth and it sounds correct.  The 2224 harmonic is really up<br/>there.
