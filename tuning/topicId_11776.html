The<br/>&gt; major aim of the work is to demonstrate that C=256 and that<br/>&gt; deviations are ruinous for Western music. It all stems<br/>&gt; from where the register breaks are in the human voice...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These same breaks are shown by the asteroid belt and correctly<br/>&gt; predicted by Keplers model.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The natural laws of the universe match those that cause<br/>&gt; registration in the human voice. Raising C, (via A=440)<br/>&gt; and Newtons theories, are both things that should be<br/>&gt; repealed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An interesting but strange read...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Valentine<br/>&gt;</p><p>This was the subject of Joscelyn Godwin&apos;s &quot;Cosmic Music&quot; (I checked, this is the actual title<br/>of the book).  The book mentions several aspects of reality that conform to Bode&apos;s Law and the<br/>Pythagorean ratios.</p><p>I think I can remember some of what is in Guy Murchie&apos;s vol.1 of &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot;.  At<br/>least I can remember how to test the theory.  Since Saturn is the octave of the Sun, all we<br/>have to do is get the mean distance of Saturn around the Sun.  Then do the standard Pythagorean<br/>ratios on that number.  For instance, whatever interval corresponds to 2/3 of the octave or<br/>Mars?, the 5th?, we would multiply? that ratio into the mean Saturn distance.  This number can<br/>then be checked against the actual mean distance of Mars? or the 2/3 Pythagorean Bode&apos;s Law<br/>planet.  The sequence of planets is Sun (Saturn), Mercury (Uranus), Venus (Neptune), Earth<br/>(Pluto), Mars, asteriods, Jupiter.  If I can remember correctly, Guy Murchie says that these<br/>planets all expand ORDEREDLY according to Bode&apos;s Law and therefore the Pythagorean ratios<br/>also.  It might be the case that he was only speaking of order of geometric expansion---- which<br/>is possible (although not likely).  This would be less satisfying to the seeker of goosebumps<br/>yet it is essentially the same mystery because the rest of nature in fact expands geometrically<br/>all according to the law of octaves (even if it is only implied spatially).  Goscelyn Godwin is<br/>more to the point about what aspects of nature are in fact obeying the Pythagorean ratios.<br/>According to her, its all aspects of reality.  The people who have been studying this subject<br/>have always been occultists or mystics.  If you check Joscelyn Godwin&apos;s other books at<br/><a href="http://amazon.com">amazon.com</a>, she is a writer of occult books.</p><p>For the subject of microtonal composition, it is interesting because the planets are in<br/>elliptical orbits and even though the mean distances of the planets and atoms are Pythagorean<br/>and diatonic or geometrically suggest such things, they are only in that state one day of the<br/>year/orbit.  The rest of the &quot;year&quot; of that planet, it is in microtonal intervals to the Sun.<br/>The entire universe is playing this microtonal music.</p><p>I am wondering which microtonal theories use the standard 7 diatonic notes and then add or<br/>subtract from these by percents thus eliminating 12 tone theory and opening the doors for<br/>microtonal scale theory and world harmony and love and light for the whole galaxy.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

By hologram, I mean something like the<br/>traditional hieroglyphic style of Chinese writing except that it<br/>has an internal sequence/logic.  I accomplished this by representing<br/>the changing lines differently.  You can see the new graphic<br/>arrangement at my webpage (it&apos;s about 2 paragraphs down):</p><p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~troubledoor">http://home.earthlink.net/~troubledoor</a></p><p>You can also download the software for free. I use Norton&apos;s anti-virus with the<br/>latest software upgrades so the download is virus free.<br/>Please distribute it to your other I Ching friends.  Thanks.</p><p>symmetric keyboard:<br/><a href="http://x31eq.com/instrum.htm">http://x31eq.com/instrum.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=11781 href="#11781">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/24/2000 12:53:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear &quot;Boders&quot;<br/>    As examining Kepler&apos;s &quot;Harmony of the Spheres&quot; in the past, we found no place where he<br/>abandoned his theory of the distances of the planets being related to the  Platonic solids.

No one who talks<br/>about it ever sounds coherent.  I can&apos;t understand what the reply below is<br/>saying.  I&apos;m sure my replies sound just as confusing.  I did manage to get the<br/>entire method out and it IS quite simple, just that in the process I made a big<br/>confusing mess of 4 replies.  I know that if I started over again and tried to<br/>explain it simpler and without the speculations that I would slip again into the<br/>speculations.  The mind is boggled by the vision of orderliness presented by the<br/>mind of antiquity.  It&apos;s in that vol. 1 of Guy Murchie&apos;s Music of the Spheres<br/>though.  He has it down very simple.  In fact, that book explains a lot of<br/>things very simply about the natural world and he likes to use musical metaphors<br/>for his explanations so it is really a highly recommended book for anyone<br/>interested in harmonics and microtonal theory.  All that is left is to go to the<br/>Goscelyn Godwin book, Cosmic Music, and see the comments on harmonics and you<br/>are ready to join a cult and wear a black hood and say &quot;OM&quot; a lot.</p><p>Kraig Grady wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear &quot;Boders&quot;<br/>&gt;     As examining Kepler&apos;s &quot;Harmony of the Spheres&quot; in the past, we found no<br/>&gt; place where he abandoned his theory of the distances of the planets being<br/>&gt; related to the  Platonic solids.
