I&apos;m not playing mine now, and don&apos;t live near<br/>New York. However, I&apos;d just like to put a plug for<br/>a guy you can see around New York who can play<br/>anything on a bottleneck guitar. Check out Dave<br/>Tronzo, he shows up in Knitting Factory circles once<br/>in awhile. For what its worth, I haven&apos;t seen him<br/>since we were in school together 20 years ago when<br/>he was prety phenominal, but I&apos;ve heard highly of<br/>him since then and have a nice &quot;rootsish&quot; CD of his,<br/>though he has done more avante-garde, fusionish and<br/>bop stuff in his career.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
