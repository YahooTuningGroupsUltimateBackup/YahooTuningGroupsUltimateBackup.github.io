Such concepts<br/>as sensory consonance, Paul Erlich&apos;s harmonic entropy, and stylistic<br/>concord/discord may all address important dimensions of the question.</p><p>Here I would like especially to address two basic points. The first is<br/>that the &quot;sensory consonance&quot; of Sethares -- a factor or dimension I<br/>might term smoothness/roughness -- can interact with Erlich&apos;s harmonic<br/>entropy or what I&apos;ll call simplicity/complexity in assorted<br/>permutations.</p><p>A second important point is to distinguish between the general theme<br/>of &quot;reasonably low integer ratios&quot; in various world musics, and the<br/>specifics often associated with &quot;JI&quot; in many discussions, for example<br/>a style where 4:5:6 or 4:5:6:7 serves as a favorite sonority. My own<br/>frequent leaning toward other kinds of sonorities with simple as well<br/>as complex ratios maybe gives me another perspective on culturally or<br/>stylistically specific assumptions.</p><p>Above all, I&apos;d like to emphasize that what I say about timbre/tuning<br/>reflects my own pragmatic experience, however idiosyncratic or<br/>otherwise, as well as theory.</p><p>Performances like those on Jacky Ligon&apos;s CD _Galunlati_ show the<br/>beauties of xenharmonic and xentonal scale design realized in<br/>exquisite musical practice, with human voices, acoustical instruments,<br/>and synthesizer sounds.</p><p>The artistry of a Balinese or Javanese gamelan ensemble, or of an<br/>ensemble performing medieval European music in Pythagorean JI, or<br/>Renaissance music in 5-limit JI (subtly adaptive, maybe), also show<br/>how theory can take shape in beautiful practice.</p><p>While often focusing on JI systems and the xentonality of Sethares,<br/>I&apos;d like to emphasize that various kinds of historical or other<br/>temperaments may bridge a continuum between these two contrasting<br/>models, with striking musical patterns sometimes possible when new<br/>timbres are applied to familiar tunings.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Terrains and textures: Entropy and sensory consonance<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In approaching the fruitful and often astonishing universe of<br/>timbre/tuning interactions, I would like to suggest a two-dimensional<br/>model in which the sensory consonance of Bill Sethares and the<br/>harmonic entropy of Paul Erlich or Dave Keenan may complement each<br/>other, with myriad permutations and choices open for musicians.</p><p>Here I will address &quot;sensory consonance&quot; first, because its musical<br/>salience and power is so dramatically tangible. Very simply, as<br/>demonstrated by traditional gamelan ensembles as well as by composers<br/>of new musics such as Ivor Darreg or Bill Sethares, the factor of<br/>timbre can radically alter perceptions of consonance/dissonance or<br/>stability/instability.</p><p>For me, an early and effective demonstration of this sonorous reality<br/>was with 17-tET, a tuning where the regular major third has a size of<br/>6/17 octave or ~423.53 cents. In the synthesizer timbres I was using,<br/>this interval seemed a bit too &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;tense&quot; to serve routinely<br/>as a Gothic-style major third, which in a 13th-14th century kind of<br/>European style should be active and unstable, but _relatively_<br/>concordant.</p><p>At some point, however, I happened to try 17-tET using a more gentle<br/>timbre on the Yahama TX-802 called &quot;Puff Pipes&quot; (voice A56), and found<br/>this same interval and tuning absolutely delightful for a 14th-century<br/>style in the manner of Guillaume de Machaut. Now those major thirds<br/>had a quality of &quot;partial concord,&quot; at once rather blending and<br/>intriguing, like Pythagorean major thirds at 81:64 (~407.82 cents) can<br/>have in assorted somewhat brighter timbres.</p><p>Recently I have been relishing a more dramatic application of sensory<br/>consonance: a &quot;well-timbred&quot; 1/4-comma meantone in which a diminished<br/>sixth at around 738 cents is musically interchangeable with a regular<br/>fifth at around 697 cents; and likewise a diminished fourth at 32:25<br/>(around 427 cents) with a usual major third at a pure 5:4 (around 386<br/>cents).</p><p>As it happens, the &quot;Piccolo&quot; timbre of the TX-802 (voice A27) can give<br/>1/4-comma meantone this quality of a &quot;well-timbrement,&quot; with sensorily<br/>concordant forms of the usual 16th-century consonances (at least to my<br/>ears) available from every step of a 12-note tuning. Two such<br/>circulating 12-note keyboards a diesis apart (128:125, ~41.06 cents)<br/>make available a gamut of &quot;modal color,&quot; with many opportunities for<br/>creative musical ambiguity.</p><p>For example, an interval of 32:25 might represent now a remote<br/>transposition of a usual Renaissance major third; now a<br/>Renaissance-style diminished fourth with a resolution typical of that<br/>era; and now a bold neo-Gothic major third inviting a 14th-century<br/>kind of resolution to some variety of stable fifth.</p><p>For more on meantone well-timbrement, and some sound files most helpfully<br/>and skillfully produced by Jacky Ligon, please see the latest issue of<br/>_The Microtonal Activist_ or TMA, volume 2, an edition featuring articles<br/>on topics ranging from the related theme of tunings/timbres with stretched<br/>or compressed intervals (Jacky and Jeff Scott) to Joseph Pehrson&apos;s lecture<br/>at Moscow Conservatory&apos;s Theremin Center (transcription by Anton Rovner)<br/>to Robert Walker&apos;s invitation to compose for the spontaneous musician:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/jacky_ligon/TMA_archive_index.htm">http://www.geocities.com/jacky_ligon/TMA_archive_index.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>Having illustrated both a &quot;moderate&quot; application of Sethareanization<br/>with 17-tET in a neo-Gothic setting, and a dramatic application with<br/>1/4-comma meantone, I would now like to turn to a harmonic entropy<br/>kind of approach as one kind of strategy for putting these phenomena<br/>in a larger perspective.</p><p>While Setharean &quot;sensory consonance&quot; often focuses on the &quot;smoothness&quot;<br/>of an interval or sonority, the harmonic entropy of Erlich or Keenan<br/>focuses on what I might term the &quot;simplicity&quot; of an interval.</p><p>For example, as we have seen, a 17-tET major third at around 423.5<br/>cents may be either &quot;rough&quot; or &quot;smooth&quot; depending on the timbre; from<br/>a viewpoint of harmonic entropy, it is in any event &quot;complex,&quot; located<br/>in a &quot;plateau&quot; region between the two simple ratios of 5:4 (~386.31<br/>cents) or 9:7 (~435.08 cents).</p><p>Similarly, the 737.64-cent diminished sixth of 1/4-comma meantone is<br/>historically famed as a &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; with its &quot;howling&quot; beats in a<br/>typical Renaissance or Baroque timbre -- the essence of &quot;roughness&quot; --<br/>but can become intriguingly smooth when &quot;well-timbred.&quot; Again,<br/>however, from a perspective of harmonic entropy, it remains a complex<br/>or plateau interval, in contrast to the usual meantone fifth at about<br/>696.58 cents located in the &quot;valley&quot; around the simple ratio of 3:2<br/>(~701.955 cents).</p><p>Combining the perspectives of sensory consonance _and_ harmonic<br/>entropy, we find ourselves in a tapestry of terrains and textures.<br/>While traditional JI systems focus on smooth valleys like 3:2 or 5:4,<br/>Setharean xentonality often explores timbres bringing about smooth<br/>plateaux: a relatively concordant major third at 424 cents, for<br/>example, or even a stable one at 427 cents.</p><p>What harmonic entropy may tell us is that while a smooth valley and a<br/>smooth plateau may be in some ways analogous or even musically<br/>interchangeable, they are not musical identical. Of course, this<br/>conclusion is quite concordant with the outlook of Bill Sethares<br/>himself, who presents xentonality as an alternative approach to<br/>conventional JI or other kinds of tunings, not a replacement for these<br/>systems.</p><p>To borrow the valley/plateau imagery, which Dave Keenan has developed<br/>in very poetic ways, Setharean tuning/timbre combinations may place us<br/>in a garden-like park -- at an elevation of 4,000 meters or 13,000<br/>feet. While the local texture of the landscape might remind us of a<br/>familiar valley, the atmospheric pressure and other features of our<br/>environment are quite different.</p><p>In a circulating meantone well-timbrement with 12 notes per octave in<br/>1/4-comma, for example, the difference of some 41 cents in the size of<br/>the diatonic and chromatic semitones will lend a different effect than<br/>in an unequal well-temperament such as Werckmeister where these sizes<br/>are not so disparate, let alone 12-tET.</p><p>To conclude for the moment these remarks on a topic inviting open<br/>dialogue, I mean to suggest that an outlook recognizing both<br/>smoothness/roughness and simplicity/complexity or valley/plateau<br/>distinctions can give us a perspective including the approaches of<br/>xentonality and traditional &quot;valley-oriented&quot; systems, including the<br/>JI systems of various cultures.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Low integer ratios: some cultural aspects of JI systems<br/>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>While some of us define &quot;JI&quot; in the most general sense as a system of<br/>music based on integer ratios, large or small, there has recently been<br/>a tendency to use the term &quot;Rational Intonation&quot; (RI) for this kind of<br/>integer-based concept, with JI suggesting more specifically a focus on<br/>_small_ integer ratios.</p><p>One very creative theorist, Dave Keenan, has suggested that JI should<br/>be defined not in terms of integer ratios, but in terms of its<br/>tangible musical effect: a &quot;locking in&quot; of partials, which can provide<br/>a basis for tuning an interval (e.g. 7:6) by ear. Keenan emphasizes<br/>that a sonority including complex intevals or dyads not in themselves<br/>&quot;just&quot; may have an overall and recognizable justness, e.g. 16:19:24</p><p>Cautioning that in what follows I speak only for myself, not for<br/>Keenan and others who have contributed to the theory of JI and<br/>tempered tunings, I find in this kind of approach a suggestion that<br/>there may be various kinds of just sonorities.</p><p>In many musical cultures, for example, we have sonorities based on<br/>pure fifths, fourths, and octaves, e.g. 2:3:4 or 3:4:6. A Pythagorean<br/>JI system makes these concords available in pure ratios, while also<br/>making available pleasing contrasts of melodic steps (pentatonic,<br/>diatonic, chromatic, or more complex).</p><p>Such a system also makes available pure ratios combining these<br/>intervals with major seconds or ninths at 9:8 or 9:4, and minor<br/>sevenths at 16:9, for example 4:6:9 or 6:8:9. These sonorities occur<br/>in traditions as diverse as Japanese koto music, Laotian music for the<br/>khene (often known as a &quot;mouth organ&quot;), and the vocal polyphony of<br/>Georgia or Gothic Europe.</p><p>Of course, a 2-3 JI or Pythagorean system also makes available a<br/>host of intervals with more complex ratios, which may represent<br/>various degrees of stylistic concord or discord depending on the<br/>musical language and also, at least to some degree, on the timbre.</p><p>Another possibility, evidenced both in the sruti system of India and<br/>in Renaissance Europe is a 2-3-5 JI system featuring major thirds at<br/>5:4 and minor thirds at 6:5. Possibly because of the contrast between<br/>&quot;just&quot; and &quot;tempered&quot; systems which had become clear in 16th-century<br/>Western Europe, the term &quot;JI&quot; often tends to imply specifically this<br/>kind of system, although the more general concept of &quot;low integer<br/>ratios&quot; or &quot;audible locking-in of partials&quot; covers a much wider<br/>ground.</p><p>An alternative approach is a 2-3-7 JI system -- or some might say a<br/>2-3-7-9 system (listing all relevant odd factors) -- featuring pure<br/>sonorities such as 12:14:18:21 or 14:18:21:24. This is typical of one<br/>main approach to neo-Gothic music, where these sonorities provide a<br/>contrast with stable concords of 2:3:4 -- while also having a rather<br/>concordant effect themselves.</p><p>Such an approach might be somewhat analogous to what may be a more<br/>familiar type of 2-3-5-7 JI system, where 4:5:6:7 may serve as an<br/>unstable but rather concordant sonority resolving to 4:5:6 or the<br/>like.</p><p>From what I take as a Keenan/Erlich type of perspective, ratios of 11<br/>may still participate in recognizably just dyads (e.g. 11:7, 11:8,<br/>11:9), but nearing the limit of recognizability for _simple<br/>intervals_. Thus something like 17:14 would not be considered in<br/>itself a &quot;just&quot; interval, although it might be used in some larger<br/>sonority considered recognizably just such as 10:12:14:17.</p><p>In contrast, the use of a sonority such as 14:17:21 in a neo-Gothic<br/>setting may represent RI rather than a Keenan type of JI: here 17:14<br/>is regarded simply as a very interesting flavor of minor (or<br/>supraminor) third, rather than necessarily reflecting any kind of<br/>unifying structure of partials.</p><p>From an harmonic entropy perspective, the question might still be<br/>raised: could the total effect of 14:17:21, influenced possibly by the<br/>&quot;anchoring&quot; outer fifth or the difference tones, represent some kind<br/>of &quot;local minimum&quot; or &quot;valley&quot;?</p><p>From a neo-Gothic perspective, the main point is simply that 14:17:21<br/>is an intriguing sonority with beautiful resolutions, and that the<br/>integer ratio provides an apt emblem and landmark for this general<br/>type or flavor of sonority (somewhere around 0-336-702 cents).</p><p>From a Keenan perspective, the label &quot;just&quot; would imply a valley where<br/>intonational effects are sensitive to small changes in tuning: would<br/>changing the sonority to 0-331-702 cents or 0-340-702 cents audibly<br/>affect its &quot;purity&quot;?</p><p>If not, then a Keenan approach, if I understand it correctly, would<br/>regard 14:17:21 as a variety of &quot;tempering by ratio&quot; -- that is,<br/>choosing a given region which is not sharply defined by a distinct<br/>&quot;valley,&quot; Erlich&apos;s &quot;entropy minimum.&quot;</p><p>This kind of approach might apply not only to JI or RI systems, but to<br/>tempered systems -- in fact, Erlich&apos;s main interest, and also an<br/>important one for Keenan.</p><p>For example, let us consider some resources of 36-tET for a neo-Gothic<br/>style, realized as a &quot;24-out-of-36&quot; system with two 12-note manuals,<br/>each with a 12-tET set, at 1/6-tone apart. (With a full 36-note<br/>tuning, all intervals would be available from all steps.)</p><p>Either manual will have quite close approximations of such 2-3 JI<br/>sonorities as 2:3:4, 6:8:9, 4:6:9, etc.</p><p>Additionally, either manual will include sonorities of 0-300-700<br/>cents, which has been noted as a nice approximation of 16:19:24, and<br/>could also be taken as not far from the Pythagorean 54:64:81 (around<br/>0-294-702 cents).</p><p>Combining notes from the two manuals makes available a favorite kind<br/>of neo-Gothic sonority closely approximating another type of &quot;JI,&quot;<br/>based on factors of 2-3-7-9: for example 14:18:21:24 (here<br/>0-433-700-933 cents) or 12:14:18:21 (here 0-267-700-967 cents).</p><p>Additionally, 36-tET has excellent renditions of the more complex<br/>14:17:21 type (here 0-333-700 cents), which might be considered RI as<br/>opposed to JI in Keenan&apos;s interpretation.</p><p>Thus from one perspective, 36-tET has an assortment of low-integer JI<br/>sonorities, as well as the more &quot;RI-like&quot; approximation of 14:17:21.</p><p>From a stylistic perspective specifically seeking 4:5:6 or 4:5:6:7,<br/>however, 36-tET would not be considered a noteworthy &quot;JI-like&quot; tuning,<br/>because the closest approximation to a pure 5:4 is the &quot;not especially<br/>close&quot; 400-cent major third.</p><p>This example may indicate how, within a general framework of &quot;JI based<br/>on recognizably pure intervals,&quot; the same tuning may be considered<br/>either an outstanding &quot;optimization&quot; (36-tET as an approximation of<br/>2-3-7-9 JI), or not so outstanding (36-tET as an approximation of<br/>2-3-5 or 2-3-5-7 JI). For the latter type of system, of course, going<br/>to 72-tET neatly adds accurate approximations of 5, as well as other<br/>types of intervals.</p><p>Maybe I should conclude this section with a curious aside on<br/>&quot;rootedness,&quot; and the possible &quot;rootless cosmopolitanism&quot; of many<br/>neo-Gothic sonorities involving thirds, treated as often relatively<br/>concordant but unstable.</p><p>Such forms as 6:7:9, 7:9:12, 12:14:18:21, 14:18:21:24, 14:17:21, and<br/>28:33:42 (around 0-284-702 cents) -- the latter two on the RI side --<br/>share the property of not having Erlich&apos;s &quot;rootedness,&quot; with the<br/>lowest note as an octave or power of two in relation to a fundamental.<br/>Compare 4:5:6, 4:5:6:7, or also 16:19:24.</p><p>Mark Lindley, writing of the transition in the 15th century from<br/>Pythagorean intonation to meantone on keyboards, has suggested that<br/>the stylistic difference pointing toward the choice of meantone may be<br/>not so much the use of lots of thirds and sixths, but their use in<br/>sonorities intended to have more &quot;solidity&quot; than Pythagorean tuning<br/>would permit.</p><p>In contrast, as I have found with Pythagorean tuning, the &quot;floating&quot;<br/>quality of a texture like early 15th-century fauxbourdon with a series<br/>of sixth sonorities eventually moving to a cadence -- but in a kind of<br/>prolonged &quot;free fall&quot; of mild coloristic instability -- can be very<br/>pleasing with complex ratios, or with simple but not &quot;rooted&quot; ones<br/>such as 7:9:12.</p><p>A similar kind of effect might explain some of the appeal of &quot;gently<br/>Sethareanized&quot; neo-Gothic tunings like 17-tET: a sonority like<br/>0-424-918 cents, or 0-424-706 cents, is &quot;smoothed&quot; but still<br/>intriguingly complex, in contrast to a &quot;rooted&quot; form.</p><p>-------------------------------<br/>3. An open xenharmonic universe<br/>-------------------------------</p><p>Having suggested the interplay of smoothness/roughness and<br/>simplicity/complexity in permutations shaped by the factors of tuning<br/>and timbre, and emphasized the variety of JI systems and outlooks<br/>(with some mention of temperament also), I might conclude by offering<br/>a few observations on &quot;smoothed plateaux&quot; as one very fertile and<br/>creative choice, but not _the_ one choice of merit.</p><p>For example, while a meantone &quot;well-timbrement&quot; is a choice opened by<br/>a Setharean approach which I find most beautiful and engaging, it<br/>does not make traditional meantone timbres (or their more or less<br/>close counterparts on synthesizer) less beautiful or relevant in the<br/>21st century.</p><p>For music in Renaissance and Xeno-Renaissance styles, whether<br/>conventional or highly experimental, traditional timbres bring out the<br/>&quot;justness&quot; of the pure 5:4 major thirds -- and also the strident<br/>quality of a 32:25 diminished fourth or the like, lending a unique<br/>color to the music which Sethareanizing somewhat mutes or<br/>&quot;pastelizes.&quot;</p><p>SImilarly, for meantone music mixing Xeno-Renaissance and neo-Gothic<br/>elements, the cadential action and excitement provided by a sonority<br/>like 0-427-931 cents (e.g. F#3-Bb3-Eb4 resolving to E3-B3-E4) with its<br/>usual &quot;beatful&quot; quality can be most exhilarating.</p><p>Pastelizing favors circulation, or more generally &quot;interchangeability<br/>with modal color,&quot; and also adds much room for creative ambiguity, but<br/>without the sharper definitions and contrasts of a more traditional<br/>timbre.</p><p>On a 24-note instrument with two 12-note manuals, either choice<br/>permits such options as Renaissance/Manneristic fifthtone progressions<br/>of a kind favored by Vicentino and Colonna, as well as neo-Gothic<br/>progressions (often mixing notes from the manuals) treating diminished<br/>fourths and sevenths as cadential major thirds and sixths, for<br/>example.</p><p>Pastelizing to the point of well-timbrement opens up full<br/>transposibility within the framework of a Xeno-Renaissance style, and<br/>also bring us into a universe of &quot;modal color&quot; with musical geometries<br/>and permutations possibly not yet adumbrated, let alone explored in<br/>practice.</p><p>Of course, it is precisely practice which often reveals such patterns.<br/>Thus while a bit of arithmetic leads me to propose a &quot;well-timbred&quot;<br/>24-note meantone system including 288 &quot;modalities&quot; -- the 12 modes of<br/>Glareanus (1547) or Zarlino (1558) transposed to each of the 24 steps<br/>of the system -- actual musicmaking is the way to find out about its<br/>realms of sonority and motion.</p><p>The mixing of neo-Gothic styles and progressions with Xeno-Renaissance<br/>ones adds to these possibilities -- without, of course, making<br/>dedicated neo-Gothic tunings obsolete, or other kinds of meantone<br/>timbres offering more colorful contrasts for this kind of stylistic<br/>mixture.</p><p>My main point in this discussion may be that the concept of a<br/>continuum does not imply a uniform or featureless terrain, but rather<br/>a diverse choice of terrains and textures offering new choices without<br/>invalidating more familiar ones, which may be appreciated for their<br/>uniqueness all the more.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2001 5:35:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here I would like especially to address two basic points.

For example, in the tuning of the CEGAD chord,<br/>which I&apos;ve been discussing with Bob Wendell, it&apos;s the<br/>smoothness/roughness consideration which is the dominant factor in<br/>determining an &quot;optimal&quot; tuning for the chord.

Two such<br/>&gt; circulating 12-note keyboards a diesis apart (128:125, ~41.06 cents)<br/>&gt; make available a gamut of &quot;modal color,&quot; with many opportunities for<br/>&gt; creative musical ambiguity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, an interval of 32:25 might represent now a remote<br/>&gt; transposition of a usual Renaissance major third; now a<br/>&gt; Renaissance-style diminished fourth with a resolution typical of<br/>that<br/>&gt; era; and now a bold neo-Gothic major third inviting a 14th-century<br/>&gt; kind of resolution to some variety of stable fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For more on meantone well-timbrement, and some sound files most<br/>helpfully<br/>&gt; and skillfully produced by Jacky Ligon, please see the latest issue<br/>of<br/>&gt; _The Microtonal Activist_ or TMA, volume 2, an edition featuring<br/>articles<br/>&gt; on topics ranging from the related theme of tunings/timbres with<br/>stretched<br/>&gt; or compressed intervals (Jacky and Jeff Scott) to Joseph Pehrson&apos;s<br/>lecture<br/>&gt; at Moscow Conservatory&apos;s Theremin Center (transcription by Anton<br/>Rovner)<br/>&gt; to Robert Walker&apos;s invitation to compose for the spontaneous<br/>musician:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/jacky_ligon/TMA_archive_index.htm">http://www.geocities.com/jacky_ligon/TMA_archive_index.htm</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Having illustrated both a &quot;moderate&quot; application of Sethareanization<br/>&gt; with 17-tET in a neo-Gothic setting, and a dramatic application with<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma meantone,</p><p>Margo, the interrelationship between tuning and timbre, as regards<br/>concordance and discordance, is undeniable, and thank you for the<br/>detailed examples. However, do you have any evidence that the effects<br/>you&apos;re mentioning are actually in accord with Sethares&apos; model? Have<br/>you worked out the mathematics? I would think, due to the<br/>mathematical nature of Sethares&apos; writings, that &quot;Sethareanization&quot;<br/>would have to refer to some operation justified on the basis of<br/>mathematical calculations using Sethares&apos; model, if not the explicit<br/>derivation of timbre from tuning or vice versa that is Sethares&apos;<br/>original contribution in this area.</p><p>&gt; I would now like to turn to a harmonic entropy<br/>&gt; kind of approach as one kind of strategy for putting these phenomena<br/>&gt; in a larger perspective.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While Setharean &quot;sensory consonance&quot; often focuses on<br/>the &quot;smoothness&quot;<br/>&gt; of an interval or sonority, the harmonic entropy of Erlich or Keenan<br/>&gt; focuses on what I might term the &quot;simplicity&quot; of an interval.</p><p>Actually, for intervals (i.e., dyads) with harmonic timbres, the two<br/>models are in close agreement, making it hard to tell exactly what is<br/>going on. It is for chords of three or more notes that the two models<br/>begin to differ significantly in their concordance/discordance<br/>rankings.</p><p>&gt; For example, as we have seen, a 17-tET major third at around 423.5<br/>&gt; cents may be either &quot;rough&quot; or &quot;smooth&quot; depending on the timbre;<br/>from<br/>&gt; a viewpoint of harmonic entropy, it is in any event &quot;complex,&quot;<br/>located<br/>&gt; in a &quot;plateau&quot; region between the two simple ratios of 5:4 (~386.31<br/>&gt; cents) or 9:7 (~435.08 cents).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Similarly, the 737.64-cent diminished sixth of 1/4-comma meantone is<br/>&gt; historically famed as a &quot;Wolf fifth&quot; with its &quot;howling&quot; beats in a<br/>&gt; typical Renaissance or Baroque timbre -- the essence<br/>of &quot;roughness&quot; --<br/>&gt; but can become intriguingly smooth when &quot;well-timbred.&quot; Again,<br/>&gt; however, from a perspective of harmonic entropy, it remains a<br/>complex<br/>&gt; or plateau interval, in contrast to the usual meantone fifth at<br/>about<br/>&gt; 696.58 cents located in the &quot;valley&quot; around the simple ratio of 3:2<br/>&gt; (~701.955 cents).</p><p>A truly &quot;Sethareanized&quot; version of an interval, such as the 423.5<br/>cent and 737.64 cent intervals you mention, would use inharmonic<br/>timbres to acheive smoothness. A harmonic entropy calculation on<br/>these intervals would then have to take into account all the partials<br/>(since they are no longer just multiples of the fundamental<br/>frequencies). Such a calculation is not likely to find these<br/>intervals at local maxima of harmonic entropy, as it does for<br/>harmonic partials.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What harmonic entropy may tell us is that while a smooth valley and<br/>a<br/>&gt; smooth plateau may be in some ways analogous or even musically<br/>&gt; interchangeable, they are not musical identical.</p><p>I&apos;m not following you here, though I&apos;d like to. Can you elaborate?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In a circulating meantone well-timbrement with 12 notes per octave<br/>in<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma, for example, the difference of some 41 cents in the size<br/>of<br/>&gt; the diatonic and chromatic semitones will lend a different effect<br/>than<br/>&gt; in an unequal well-temperament such as Werckmeister where these<br/>sizes<br/>&gt; are not so disparate, let alone 12-tET.</p><p>This is a very important point, and very true, and something I often<br/>bring up. I&apos;m not sure what it has to do with the issue at hand,<br/>though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From what I take as a Keenan/Erlich type of perspective, ratios of<br/>11<br/>&gt; may still participate in recognizably just dyads (e.g. 11:7, 11:8,<br/>&gt; 11:9), but nearing the limit of recognizability for _simple<br/>&gt; intervals_. Thus something like 17:14 would not be considered in<br/>&gt; itself a &quot;just&quot; interval, although it might be used in some larger<br/>&gt; sonority considered recognizably just such as 10:12:14:17.</p><p>I think you&apos;ve captured the Keenan/Erlich perspective very well,<br/>though personally I&apos;d never drag the word &quot;just&quot; into this . . . I&apos;d<br/>substitute &quot;concordant&quot; instead in the paragraph above. I have<br/>always, and will continue to, allow 17:14 to be considered a &quot;just&quot;<br/>interval -- the simplest reason would be that one could tune<br/>10:12:14:17 easily by ear on say, a harmonium, and then proceed to<br/>use the bare interval 17:14 in one&apos;s music. That&apos;s enough to make<br/>it &quot;just&quot; for me (going by the culture in which I live and the<br/>literature to which I&apos;ve been exposed, rather than by a dictionary<br/>entry).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From an harmonic entropy perspective, the question might still be<br/>&gt; raised: could the total effect of 14:17:21, influenced possibly by<br/>the<br/>&gt; &quot;anchoring&quot; outer fifth or the difference tones, represent some kind<br/>&gt; of &quot;local minimum&quot; or &quot;valley&quot;?</p><p>I&apos;m almost certain that, at least if the chord is played in a<br/>somewhat high register (say three to four octaves above middle C),<br/>such a local minimum could be audibly recognized, while a Sethares-<br/>based approach to discordance would fail to predict one, if harmonic<br/>timbres are used.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From a neo-Gothic perspective, the main point is simply that<br/>14:17:21<br/>&gt; is an intriguing sonority with beautiful resolutions, and that the<br/>&gt; integer ratio provides an apt emblem and landmark for this general<br/>&gt; type or flavor of sonority (somewhere around 0-336-702 cents).</p><p>Certainly, though if I were in the position of lending advice to a<br/>novice at microtonality, and if 14:17:21 were not being perceived as<br/>a point of stability relative to its immediate neighbors on the<br/>triadic plane, I would advise that it would probably prove more<br/>useful to think of the sonority as a just fifth split into a 336-cent<br/>interval and a 366-cent interval . . . mainly because addition and<br/>subtraction (as with cents) are so much easier than multiplication<br/>and division (as with ratios) as a way of understanding musical<br/>intervals -- for example, one can easily see which intervals are<br/>larger and which are smaller; one can plan resolutions and other<br/>progressions without having to be constrained by cumbersome, and<br/>often limiting, ratio calculations; and one can immediately see when<br/>familiar, concordant intervals are approximated in the course of<br/>combining other intervals -- something which the multiple-digit<br/>ratios which arise in the course of JI arithmetic actually obscure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such forms as 6:7:9, 7:9:12, 12:14:18:21, 14:18:21:24, 14:17:21, and<br/>&gt; 28:33:42 (around 0-284-702 cents) -- the latter two on the RI side -<br/>-<br/>&gt; share the property of not having Erlich&apos;s &quot;rootedness,&quot; with the<br/>&gt; lowest note as an octave or power of two in relation to a<br/>fundamental.</p><p>Though I&apos;d add that some modicum of &quot;rootedness&quot; does manage to<br/>impart a degree of stability to these chords, due to the lowest note<br/>participating as the &quot;2&quot; in a 2:3 relationship with one other note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In contrast, as I have found with Pythagorean tuning, the &quot;floating&quot;<br/>&gt; quality of a texture like early 15th-century fauxbourdon with a<br/>series<br/>&gt; of sixth sonorities eventually moving to a cadence -- but in a kind<br/>of<br/>&gt; prolonged &quot;free fall&quot; of mild coloristic instability -- can be very<br/>&gt; pleasing with complex ratios, or with simple but not &quot;rooted&quot; ones<br/>&gt; such as 7:9:12.</p><p>What would an example of a &quot;rooted&quot; version of a &quot;sixth sonority&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Pastelizing favors circulation, or more<br/>generally &quot;interchangeability<br/>&gt; with modal color,&quot; and also adds much room for creative ambiguity,<br/>but<br/>&gt; without the sharper definitions and contrasts of a more traditional<br/>&gt; timbre.</p><p>I would agree, and would offer my own observation<br/>that &quot;pastelization&quot; (an expression I like much better<br/>than &quot;Sethareanization&quot; for referring to the use of timbres which<br/>mute the differences in concordance between simple-integer ratios<br/>[other than octaves] and intervals far from them -- thanks Margo) is<br/>very useful when trying to work with 9-tET, which has powerful<br/>melodic and modulatory resources but rather harsh harmonies in many<br/>conventional timbres.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; My main point in this discussion may be that the concept of a<br/>&gt; continuum does not imply a uniform or featureless terrain, but<br/>rather<br/>&gt; a diverse choice of terrains and textures offering new choices<br/>without<br/>&gt; invalidating more familiar ones, which may be appreciated for their<br/>&gt; uniqueness all the more.</p><p>I heartily affirm this point, Margo.

For example, in the tuning of the CEGAD chord,<br/>&gt; which I&apos;ve been discussing with Bob Wendell, it&apos;s the<br/>&gt; smoothness/roughness consideration which is the dominant factor in<br/>&gt; determining an &quot;optimal&quot; tuning for the chord. For other chords,<br/>&gt; such as a half-diminished seventh chord, the reverse seems to be<br/>&gt; true.</p><p>Yes, the smoothness/roughness and simplicity/complexity dimensions can<br/>have some interesting tradeoffs, and a discussion you&apos;ve had with<br/>Joseph Pehrson maybe helps me in responding to some of what follows.</p><p>&gt; Again, I&apos;ve always emphasized that this needs to be a<br/>&gt; two-dimensional model just as you spell out. However, there may be<br/>&gt; some misunderstanding about the &quot;choice&quot; aspect of this. All choices<br/>&gt; should always be open for musicians. I don&apos;t see what a model of<br/>&gt; concordance/discordance has to do with this.</p><p>First, thanks for emphasizing a very important point: these models are<br/>designed, maybe, in good part precisely to illuminate some of the<br/>choices available which might not otherwise be recognized. In that<br/>way, while all choices are always open, a good theory can help by<br/>revealing what some of those choices, maybe less familiar ones, are --<br/>or what some possibly yet unrealized choices might be.</p><p>&gt; Margo, the interrelationship between tuning and timbre, as regards<br/>&gt; concordance and discordance, is undeniable, and thank you for the<br/>&gt; detailed examples. However, do you have any evidence that the<br/>&gt; effects you&apos;re mentioning are actually in accord with Sethares&apos;<br/>&gt; model? Have you worked out the mathematics?</p><p>Please let me admit that at least at this point, you or Bill Sethares<br/>might be a better judge of that than I: when I understand more about<br/>the model, maybe I could attempt a comment.</p><p>At this point, I might sum up my understanding of the data about as<br/>follows. As described in the TMA article, Jacky Ligon very helpfully<br/>did a spectrum analysis on the TX-802 &quot;Piccolo&quot; timbre (preset A27),<br/>and found partials at an octave-reduced 428 cents and 744 cents. These<br/>looked very interesting to me for optimizing intervals like the<br/>427-cent diminished fourth or 738-cent diminished sixth (or &quot;Wolf<br/>fifth&quot;) of 1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>So I understand that the partials seem to approximate the vertical<br/>intervals, but of course either your model or that of Sethares might<br/>address all kinds of questions. For example, why is it that the usual<br/>meantone intervals (e.g. 386-cent major thirds, 697-cent fifths) also<br/>sound consonant in this timbre? In some Sethareanized timbres, the<br/>&quot;familiar&quot; ratios can sound quite dissonant.</p><p>Of course, to me, it&apos;s a thrilling musical experience, whatever the<br/>exact model -- but that shouldn&apos;t stop me from asking questions and<br/>learning from you and Bill Sethares and others who have considered the<br/>fine points here.</p><p>&gt; I would think, due to the mathematical nature of Sethares&apos; writings,<br/>&gt; that &quot;Sethareanization&quot; would have to refer to some operation<br/>&gt; justified on the basis of mathematical calculations using Sethares&apos;<br/>&gt; model, if not the explicit derivation of timbre from tuning or vice<br/>&gt; versa that is Sethares&apos; original contribution in this area.</p><p>Of course this is a very reasonable point -- just as Einsteinian<br/>special relativity has definite and known mathematics, which I&apos;ve<br/>taken pleasure in applying to calculate the time dilation effect of my<br/>travel at around 1.5 meters per second or whatever, possibly a comment<br/>on the practical relevance of the some of the math I post here.</p><p>I must admit that for me, &quot;Sethareanization&quot; has much a more<br/>colloquial meaning, basically: &quot;Combining tuning and timbre and<br/>happening to arrive at a notable effect, especially if it involves<br/>making some interval strikingly more consonant or less dissonant than<br/>might be expected.&quot;</p><p>With the 738-cent fifth, I&apos;d say additionally that the tuning/timbre<br/>combination did apparently involve a rough fit between partials and<br/>vertical intervals.</p><p>However, I realize that we could cite everyone from gamelan builders<br/>and players to Sabaneev, Darreg, Gamer, and Carlos for the idea of a<br/>tuning/timbre interaction, so the question comes up of what is<br/>_distinctively_ &quot;Setharean,&quot; and the math seems one obvious answer.</p><p>In my kind of usage, &quot;Sethareanization&quot; is often a byword simply for<br/>finding a timbre that happens to match a tuning, or to have a nice<br/>effect with a specific piece in that tuning.</p><p>&gt;&gt; While Setharean &quot;sensory consonance&quot; often focuses on the<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;smoothness&quot; of an interval or sonority, the harmonic entropy of &gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Erlich or Keenan focuses on what I might term the &quot;simplicity&quot; of<br/>&gt;&gt; an interval.</p><p>&gt; Actually, for intervals (i.e., dyads) with harmonic timbres, the two<br/>&gt; models are in close agreement, making it hard to tell exactly what<br/>&gt; is going on. It is for chords of three or more notes that the two<br/>&gt; models begin to differ significantly in their<br/>&gt; concordance/discordance rankings.</p><p>This is an interesting comparison, and one I might better understand<br/>when I better grasp the two models. I tend to associate the Sethares<br/>model with smoothness, the critical band, and so forth; and harmonic<br/>entropy with the probability of recognition of an interval as<br/>representing a given ratio type.</p><p>&gt; A truly &quot;Sethareanized&quot; version of an interval, such as the 423.5<br/>&gt; cent and 737.64 cent intervals you mention, would use inharmonic<br/>&gt; timbres to acheive smoothness. A harmonic entropy calculation on<br/>&gt; these intervals would then have to take into account all the<br/>&gt; partials (since they are no longer just multiples of the fundamental<br/>&gt; frequencies). Such a calculation is not likely to find these<br/>&gt; intervals at local maxima of harmonic entropy, as it does for<br/>&gt; harmonic partials.</p><p>This is really interesting. With the timbre Jacky analyzed as having<br/>a partial around 744 cents, it would be interesting to see what the<br/>minima and maxima would look like (also taking the other partials into<br/>account, as you say).</p><p>&gt;&gt; What harmonic entropy may tell us is that while a smooth valley and<br/>&gt;&gt; a smooth plateau may be in some ways analogous or even musically<br/>&gt;&gt; interchangeable, they are not musical identical.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not following you here, though I&apos;d like to. Can you elaborate?</p><p>Reading a further dialogue between you and Joe Pehrson has maybe<br/>helped me to appreciate one possible difference, although I should be<br/>careful to seek your guidance on whether harmonic entropy theory would<br/>lead to kind of distinction I&apos;m about to discuss.</p><p>The point you and Joe were discussing was that an inharmonic or a<br/>&quot;pastelized&quot; timbre differs from a harmonic timbre in other ways than<br/>just happening to have different minima or maxima of local consonance,<br/>or a different degree of smoothness or consonance for a given<br/>interval.</p><p>What the two of you were discussing is the idea that pitch definition<br/>itself can be more vague or imprecise in an inharmonic timbre: the<br/>tuning, or scale, may not be so sharply defined. Maybe it&apos;s a bit of<br/>&quot;Impressionistic&quot; pastelization (a very visual metaphor); the colors<br/>are more gentle, but the outlines of the scene itself are a bit<br/>blurred or indistinct.</p><p>To borrow my metaphor, we&apos;re in a garden-like park that reminds us of<br/>a valley, but thousands of meters up on a plateau where there are<br/>mists or clouds that make the scene different than in the valley.</p><p>&gt;&gt; In a circulating meantone well-timbrement with 12 notes per octave<br/>&gt;&gt; in 1/4-comma, for example, the difference of some 41 cents in the<br/>&gt;&gt; size of the diatonic and chromatic semitones will lend a different<br/>&gt;&gt; effect than in an unequal well-temperament such as Werckmeister<br/>&gt;&gt; where these sizes are not so disparate, let alone 12-tET.</p><p>&gt; This is a very important point, and very true, and something I often<br/>&gt; bring up. I&apos;m not sure what it has to do with the issue at hand,<br/>&gt; though.</p><p>Actually, though maybe I wasn&apos;t sure just where I was going when I<br/>wrote this, a question does now occur to me maybe related more<br/>directly to the issues we&apos;re discussing. Might the melodic contrasts<br/>between those step sizes in a circulating tuning/timbre, for example,<br/>make up for the somewhat indistinct pitch definition that could occur<br/>because of the inharmonic timbre?</p><p>We seem very much in agreement that the melodic aspect shouldn&apos;t get<br/>neglected, and one issue here might be how timbral choices mainly<br/>directed to vertical consonance might affect the definition of melodic<br/>lines.</p><p>&gt;&gt; From what I take as a Keenan/Erlich type of perspective, ratios of<br/>&gt;&gt; 11 may still participate in recognizably just dyads (e.g. 11:7,<br/>&gt;&gt; 11:8, 11:9), but nearing the limit of recognizability for _simple<br/>&gt;&gt; intervals_. Thus something like 17:14 would not be considered in<br/>&gt;&gt; itself a &quot;just&quot; interval, although it might be used in some larger<br/>&gt;&gt; sonority considered recognizably just such as 10:12:14:17.</p><p>&gt; I think you&apos;ve captured the Keenan/Erlich perspective very well,<br/>&gt; though personally I&apos;d never drag the word &quot;just&quot; into this . . . I&apos;d<br/>&gt; substitute &quot;concordant&quot; instead in the paragraph above. I have<br/>&gt; always, and will continue to, allow 17:14 to be considered a &quot;just&quot;<br/>&gt; interval -- the simplest reason would be that one could tune<br/>&gt; 10:12:14:17 easily by ear on say, a harmonium, and then proceed to<br/>&gt; use the bare interval 17:14 in one&apos;s music. That&apos;s enough to make it<br/>&gt; &quot;just&quot; for me (going by the culture in which I live and the<br/>&gt; literature to which I&apos;ve been exposed, rather than by a dictionary<br/>&gt; entry).</p><p>Thanks for this clarification, and I know that usages can vary here<br/>even among theorists with generally quite similar views. Personally I<br/>would tend to speak in terms of &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;complex&quot; intervals: it&apos;s<br/>interesting to consider how flexible a term like &quot;consonance&quot; can be,<br/>and I know that I find it natural to use in at least three or four<br/>different ways.</p><p>&gt;&gt; From an harmonic entropy perspective, the question might still be<br/>&gt;&gt; raised: could the total effect of 14:17:21, influenced possibly by<br/>&gt;&gt; the &quot;anchoring&quot; outer fifth or the difference tones, represent some<br/>&gt;&gt; kind of &quot;local minimum&quot; or &quot;valley&quot;?</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m almost certain that, at least if the chord is played in a<br/>&gt; somewhat high register (say three to four octaves above middle C),<br/>&gt; such a local minimum could be audibly recognized, while a Sethares-<br/>&gt; based approach to discordance would fail to predict one, if harmonic<br/>&gt; timbres are used.</p><p>That&apos;s really interesting, and I&apos;d be really curious about the results<br/>of this kind of experiment. Are there specific elements of a triadic<br/>harmonic entropy that would predict the minimum? One idea that occurs<br/>to me is difference tones, for example, which Heinz Bohlen has focused<br/>on in writing about consonance issues.</p><p>By the way, I&apos;d agree that for a newcomer to microtonality, and often<br/>more generally, something like your explanation of a splitting of the<br/>fifth into intervals around 336 and 366 cents might be more flexible<br/>and descriptive than 14:17:21. In fact, the idea is a region of<br/>supraminor and submajor thirds which often vary a few cents in either<br/>direction, depending on the tuning.</p><p>The one tuning I use with a pure 14:17:21 is a &quot;Pythagorean<br/>enharmonic,&quot; where the ratio defines the tuning scheme. Typically,<br/>however, it could range from 0-331-703 to 0-341-705, for example, more<br/>of a zone, or a mood, than a specific defined ratio.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Such forms as 6:7:9, 7:9:12, 12:14:18:21, 14:18:21:24, 14:17:21,<br/>&gt;&gt; and 28:33:42 (around 0-284-702 cents) -- the latter two on the RI<br/>&gt;&gt; side -- share the property of not having Erlich&apos;s &quot;rootedness,&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; with the lowest note as an octave or power of two in relation to a<br/>&gt;&gt; fundamental.</p><p>&gt; Though I&apos;d add that some modicum of &quot;rootedness&quot; does manage to<br/>&gt; impart a degree of stability to these chords, due to the lowest note<br/>&gt; participating as the &quot;2&quot; in a 2:3 relationship with one other note.</p><p>Right, and this is the &quot;anchoring&quot; of the 2:3 that I&apos;ve read about in<br/>20th-century harmony books. I wonder if that&apos;s a possible term to<br/>distinguish it from the &quot;rootedness&quot; based on the lowest note as an<br/>octave or 2^n of the fundamental?</p><p>&gt;&gt; In contrast, as I have found with Pythagorean tuning, the &quot;floating&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; quality of a texture like early 15th-century fauxbourdon with a<br/>&gt;&gt; series of sixth sonorities eventually moving to a cadence -- but in<br/>&gt;&gt; a kind of prolonged &quot;free fall&quot; of mild coloristic instability --<br/>&gt;&gt; can be very pleasing with complex ratios, or with simple but not<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;rooted&quot; ones such as 7:9:12.</p><p>&gt; What would an example of a &quot;rooted&quot; version of a &quot;sixth sonority&quot;?</p><p>With 7:9:12, or for that matter 12:15:20 in a later Renaissance<br/>setting, I&apos;d agree with what I take as your implicit point that such<br/>sonorities aren&apos;t &quot;rooted&quot; by either the n^2 kind of concept or the<br/>anchoring effect of a fifth above the lowest note. In the early<br/>15th-century setting -- and to a degree in the later setting also<br/>(meantone or adaptive JI) -- the cadential role of a sixth expanding<br/>to an octave may also have a connection with the kind of effect I<br/>describe.</p><p>Curiously, some other kinds of sixth sonorities can be &quot;rooted&quot; or at<br/>least &quot;anchored.&quot; For example, 14:18:21:24 (0-435-702-933 cents) has a<br/>fifth above the lowest note. These would involve the fifth and sixth<br/>above the lowest note.</p><p>For simple ratios of major sixths that harmonic entropy theory would<br/>consider &quot;recognizable&quot; as simple dyads, I notice that the lowest<br/>voice of the sonority will have some prime factor other than 2, e.g<br/>3:5, or 7:12.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Pastelizing favors circulation, or more generally<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;interchangeability with modal color,&quot; and also adds much room for<br/>&gt;&gt; creative ambiguity, but without the sharper definitions and<br/>&gt;&gt; contrasts of a more traditional timbre.</p><p>&gt; I would agree, and would offer my own observation that<br/>&gt; &quot;pastelization&quot; (an expression I like much better than<br/>&gt; &quot;Sethareanization&quot; for referring to the use of timbres which mute<br/>&gt; the differences in concordance between simple-integer ratios [other<br/>&gt; than octaves] and intervals far from them -- thanks Margo) is very<br/>&gt; useful when trying to work with 9-tET, which has powerful melodic<br/>&gt; and modulatory resources but rather harsh harmonies in many<br/>&gt; conventional timbres.</p><p>Maybe &quot;pastelization&quot; could refer to a general muting of contrasts, as<br/>you say, with the implication that usual concords remain concordant;<br/>in some tunings of Bill Sethares, such concords with simple ratios may<br/>actually take on a dissonant quality, and then we&apos;d want some other<br/>term.</p><p>By the way, in a cadential context in 20-tET, I use the term &quot;pastel&quot;<br/>to describe a lessened contrast between sizes of melodic steps; maybe<br/>the general idea would muting either vertical or melodic contrasts, so<br/>that the two usages could be related.</p><p>&gt;&gt; My main point in this discussion may be that the concept of a<br/>&gt;&gt; continuum does not imply a uniform or featureless terrain, but<br/>&gt;&gt; rather a diverse choice of terrains and textures offering new<br/>&gt;&gt; choices without invalidating more familiar ones, which may be<br/>&gt;&gt; appreciated for their uniqueness all the more.</p><p>&gt; I heartily affirm this point, Margo. Thanks, as always, for the<br/>&gt; eloquent and elaborate exposition of your extra-dodecaphonic<br/>&gt; experiments and entertainments -- edifying as ever!</p><p>Thanks also for your comments, and patient explanations, not only<br/>clarifying concepts but providing incitements to new music.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/16/2001 2:42:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; At this point, I might sum up my understanding of the data about as<br/>&gt; follows. As described in the TMA article, Jacky Ligon very helpfully<br/>&gt; did a spectrum analysis on the TX-802 &quot;Piccolo&quot; timbre (preset A27),<br/>&gt; and found partials at an octave-reduced 428 cents and 744 cents.<br/>These<br/>&gt; looked very interesting to me for optimizing intervals like the<br/>&gt; 427-cent diminished fourth or 738-cent diminished sixth (or &quot;Wolf<br/>&gt; fifth&quot;) of 1/4-comma meantone.</p><p>Fascinating? Just curious . . . was this spectrum analysis done on<br/>the results of playing many different pitches in the &quot;Piccolo&quot;<br/>timbre, or just one? How many octaves above the fundamental were<br/>these partials? Were they true partials or simply local maxima of<br/>some broad-band noise &quot;humps&quot;? Did they die out quickly, or were they<br/>sustained as long as the key was held down? The reason I ask is that<br/>a true, acoustic, sustained piccolo sound, should be characterized by<br/>an approximate harmonic series, plus noise. The reason I<br/>say &quot;approximate&quot; is that, since the physics of turbulent air is not<br/>so well understood, I don&apos;t feel confident asserting that an exact<br/>harmonic series results (as it does in reed, brass, bowed string, and<br/>human voice sustained sounds).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I understand that the partials seem to approximate the vertical<br/>&gt; intervals, but of course either your model or that of Sethares might<br/>&gt; address all kinds of questions. For example, why is it that the<br/>usual<br/>&gt; meantone intervals (e.g. 386-cent major thirds, 697-cent fifths)<br/>also<br/>&gt; sound consonant in this timbre?</p><p>The timbre must be primarily harmonic or nearly so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With the 738-cent fifth, I&apos;d say additionally that the tuning/timbre<br/>&gt; combination did apparently involve a rough fit between partials and<br/>&gt; vertical intervals.</p><p>If that was in fact the case (subject to the questions I asked<br/>above), then yes, Sethareanization, or better &quot;Carlosization&quot;, would<br/>be an apt description.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Actually, for intervals (i.e., dyads) with harmonic timbres, the<br/>two<br/>&gt; &gt; models are in close agreement, making it hard to tell exactly what<br/>&gt; &gt; is going on. It is for chords of three or more notes that the two<br/>&gt; &gt; models begin to differ significantly in their<br/>&gt; &gt; concordance/discordance rankings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is an interesting comparison, and one I might better understand<br/>&gt; when I better grasp the two models. I tend to associate the Sethares<br/>&gt; model with smoothness, the critical band, and so forth; and harmonic<br/>&gt; entropy with the probability of recognition of an interval as<br/>&gt; representing a given ratio type.</p><p>This is correct, and, since harmonic partials are in simple-ratio<br/>relationships, is why the two models tend to agree for dyads with<br/>harmonic timbres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A truly &quot;Sethareanized&quot; version of an interval, such as the 423.5<br/>&gt; &gt; cent and 737.64 cent intervals you mention, would use inharmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; timbres to acheive smoothness. A harmonic entropy calculation on<br/>&gt; &gt; these intervals would then have to take into account all the<br/>&gt; &gt; partials (since they are no longer just multiples of the<br/>fundamental<br/>&gt; &gt; frequencies). Such a calculation is not likely to find these<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals at local maxima of harmonic entropy, as it does for<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic partials.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is really interesting. With the timbre Jacky analyzed as having<br/>&gt; a partial around 744 cents, it would be interesting to see what the<br/>&gt; minima and maxima would look like (also taking the other partials<br/>into<br/>&gt; account, as you say).</p><p>At present a harmonic entropy calculation with a large number of<br/>inharmonic frequencies is beyond my computational capabilities :(</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; What harmonic entropy may tell us is that while a smooth valley<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; a smooth plateau may be in some ways analogous or even musically<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; interchangeable, they are not musical identical.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m not following you here, though I&apos;d like to. Can you elaborate?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Reading a further dialogue between you and Joe Pehrson has maybe<br/>&gt; helped me to appreciate one possible difference, although I should<br/>be<br/>&gt; careful to seek your guidance on whether harmonic entropy theory<br/>would<br/>&gt; lead to kind of distinction I&apos;m about to discuss.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point you and Joe were discussing was that an inharmonic or a<br/>&gt; &quot;pastelized&quot; timbre differs from a harmonic timbre in other ways<br/>than<br/>&gt; just happening to have different minima or maxima of local<br/>consonance,<br/>&gt; or a different degree of smoothness or consonance for a given<br/>&gt; interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What the two of you were discussing is the idea that pitch<br/>definition<br/>&gt; itself can be more vague or imprecise in an inharmonic timbre: the<br/>&gt; tuning, or scale, may not be so sharply defined. Maybe it&apos;s a bit of<br/>&gt; &quot;Impressionistic&quot; pastelization (a very visual metaphor); the colors<br/>&gt; are more gentle, but the outlines of the scene itself are a bit<br/>&gt; blurred or indistinct.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To borrow my metaphor, we&apos;re in a garden-like park that reminds us<br/>of<br/>&gt; a valley, but thousands of meters up on a plateau where there are<br/>&gt; mists or clouds that make the scene different than in the valley.</p><p>If you&apos;re asking me whether harmonic entropy theory has anything to<br/>say about the &quot;pastelization&quot; of pitch itself, I would say yes,<br/>absolutely. Take a look at the very recent discussions between Carl<br/>and myself on <a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com">harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com</a>, and join in if you<br/>have questions or comments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, though maybe I wasn&apos;t sure just where I was going when I<br/>&gt; wrote this, a question does now occur to me maybe related more<br/>&gt; directly to the issues we&apos;re discussing. Might the melodic contrasts<br/>&gt; between those step sizes in a circulating tuning/timbre, for<br/>example,<br/>&gt; make up for the somewhat indistinct pitch definition that could<br/>occur<br/>&gt; because of the inharmonic timbre?</p><p>Perhaps one would tend to hear slightly unequal steps as equal when<br/>pitch definition was indistinct, so perhaps added inequality in step<br/>sizes is sometimes aesthetically appropriate when &quot;pastelizing&quot; . . .<br/>is that what you&apos;re suggesting? Note that this wouldn&apos;t speak against<br/>using ETs with pastelized timbres, if you were planning to base you<br/>melodies on MOS or other unequally-spaced _subsets_ of these ETs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s really interesting, and I&apos;d be really curious about the<br/>results<br/>&gt; of this kind of experiment. Are there specific elements of a triadic<br/>&gt; harmonic entropy that would predict the minimum?</p><p>The groundwork for calculating triadic harmonic entropy has been laid<br/>out on <a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com">harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com</a> -- what remains is to perform<br/>the actual (vast) calculation.</p><p>&gt; One idea that occurs<br/>&gt; to me is difference tones, for example, which Heinz Bohlen has<br/>focused<br/>&gt; on in writing about consonance issues.</p><p>I understand Heinz Bohlen&apos;s views but I think he ignores the<br/>importance of harmonic entropy (which tends to agree with a<br/>difference-tone-based analysis) and critical-band roughness (which<br/>often disagrees with it) for consonance and dissonance, especially in<br/>cases where difference tones are inaudible -- perhaps partly as a<br/>result of the particular tunings and timbres he has concentrated on.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Such forms as 6:7:9, 7:9:12, 12:14:18:21, 14:18:21:24, 14:17:21,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and 28:33:42 (around 0-284-702 cents) -- the latter two on the RI<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; side -- share the property of not having Erlich&apos;s &quot;rootedness,&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; with the lowest note as an octave or power of two in relation to<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fundamental.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Though I&apos;d add that some modicum of &quot;rootedness&quot; does manage to<br/>&gt; &gt; impart a degree of stability to these chords, due to the lowest<br/>note<br/>&gt; &gt; participating as the &quot;2&quot; in a 2:3 relationship with one other<br/>note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, and this is the &quot;anchoring&quot; of the 2:3 that I&apos;ve read about<br/>in<br/>&gt; 20th-century harmony books. I wonder if that&apos;s a possible term to<br/>&gt; distinguish it from the &quot;rootedness&quot; based on the lowest note as an<br/>&gt; octave or 2^n of the fundamental?</p><p>Whether one distinguishes it or not, I think it&apos;s clear that the<br/>brain seems to &quot;try out&quot; all subsets of the tones it hears, looking<br/>for a clear root, willing to treat the additional tones as &quot;noise&quot; or<br/>as a separate stimulus with its own root. One of the inspirations for<br/>harmonic entropy was Parncutt&apos;s approach in his book _Harmony: A<br/>Psychoacoustical Approach_. In the book he characterizes chords by<br/>two perceptual qualities: their salience (clear relation to a root)<br/>and multiplicity (the apparant number of tones sounding). Harmonic<br/>entropy for chords of more than two tones, as has been discussed,<br/>would have to consider ratio-interpretations for all possible<br/>subsets, as well as for the chord as a whole, and even a subset that<br/>exhibits &quot;rootedness&quot; should effectively decrease the multiplicity of<br/>a chord (sorry, my food-deprived brain can&apos;t make more sense right<br/>now).</p><p>Anyhow, I welcome your terminological distinction, and would suggest<br/>that sometimes a 5:4, and perhaps even a 7:4, can serve<br/>the &quot;anchoring&quot; function, and not just 3:2.</p></div>
