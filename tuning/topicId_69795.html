        <a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Why least-squares with sinusoidal weights gives 7 or 8 regular meantone fifths</h1><h3><a id=69795 href="#69795">ðŸ”—</a>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@gmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2007 1:10:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I figured it out with old-fashioned algebra and trig.</p><p>What is determining the overall shape is the balance between major<br/>thirds in each triple sharing a minor diesis (e.g. C,E,G#). They have<br/>weights W1, W2, W3 equal to<br/>W0+cos(theta), W0+cos(theta+2pi/3), W0+cos(theta-2pi/3)<br/>where theta ranges round the circle. For a tuning &apos;centred&apos; at C major<br/>we can choose that theta=0 corresponds to C.</p><p>If for the moment we ignore fifths, the least-squares solution is that<br/>the three deviations go as<br/>t1=W2W3, t2=W3W1, t3=W1W2<br/>with the sum W1W2 + W2W3 + W3W1 being equal to the diesis.</p><p>In fact this sum is identically equal to 3(W0^2-1/4).<br/>Therefore the expected deviations of thirds are proportional to<br/>(W0+cos(theta+2pi/3))(W0+cos(theta-2pi/3))<br/>which turns out to be</p><p>WO^2-1/4 - W0cos(theta) + 1/2 Cos(2 theta)</p><p>To find what happens near the &apos;central&apos; key (i.e. the meantone-like<br/>part) we can expand in powers of theta. I won&apos;t go into the details,<br/>but it turns out that when W0=2 (thus the weighting is [3,1]) the<br/>coefficients of theta vanish up to the fourth power! So the thirds<br/>vary *unexpectedly slowly* round the circle.</p><p>And for W0 somewhat less than 2, one has a negative theta^2 term and a<br/>positive theta^4 term that more or less cancel - so that the thirds<br/>stay almost exactly the same, up to theta=pi/3, that is 1/6 the way<br/>round the circle.</p><p>To put this back in musical terms, because of the way thirds are<br/>balanced against each other, for a range of reasonable-seeming<br/>weightings, one obtains a run of 5 major thirds with virtually the<br/>same deviation.</p><p>If the weighting is shifted a little round the circle so that (say) C<br/>and G equally get the highest weight (i.e. set theta=-pi/12 for C),<br/>the number of thirds which come out regular is only 4.</p><p>Now considering the fifths, in the parts of the circle where the<br/>solution for the thirds is regular, they will tend to follow suit -<br/>their influence on the resulting shape is a lot less than that of the<br/>thirds, particularly if their deviations are smaller (i.e. if thirds<br/>deviate more than 1/5 comma) - which turns out to be the case for<br/>almost all choices of weighting.</p><p>Then when the solution indicates 5(4) quasi-regular thirds, we should<br/>get 8(7) quasi-regular meantone fifths.</p><p>For example: with W0=1.65 (i.e. [2.65, 0.65]), equal weight between<br/>fifths and major thirds, and a small offset from G-centred weights, I<br/>get thirds</p><p>8.1, 7.9, 7.7, 8.8, 12.6, 18.2, 22.9, 24.3, 21.3, 16.0, 11.4, 8.9</p><p>and fifths</p><p>-3.4, -3.6, -3.5, -3.4, -3.6, -3.8, -2.5, 0.4, 2.0, 1.0, -1.1, -2.6</p><p>(Curious coincidence here that the &apos;worst&apos; third comes in the same<br/>place as the &apos;best&apos; fifth...)</p><p>What this might have to do with musical practice is unclear - but<br/>maybe Werckmeister knew more than he let on, when he recommended the<br/>continuo tuning with 7 or 8 regular meantone fifths and 2 or 3 wide<br/>ones for the &apos;diatonic-chromatic-genus, which is mostly used these days&apos;.</p><p>If I can try to summarize what I think it means:</p><p>C major (in general the &apos;central&apos; key, sometimes in fact G) can&apos;t be<br/>too good, otherwise both E and Ab major will be too bad, taking<br/>account of their non-negligible frequency of use.</p><p>G major might be a little better if one considers the less often-used<br/>B major, but the fact that Eb major is rather more common contradicts<br/>that. Overall (for a wide range of weightings) it&apos;s a wash. (Similarly<br/>for F major.)</p><p>D major might be better, considering the &apos;worst&apos; key F# major; but<br/>again this is contradicted by Bb major, which should now be about<br/>equal with D. Again, more or less a wash.</p><p>Only when we get 3 places away from the &apos;centre&apos; do we reach a key<br/>that is competing with a &apos;better&apos; one: hence A major (or E major, with<br/>the centre at G) must finally have worse intonation.</p><p>Conclusion: Mildly Modified Meantones Minimize Musical Mistuning!</p><p>... And they&apos;re easy to tune, too.</p><p>~~~T~~~</p><p>P.S. Anyone who objects to my notation can jump in a lake, for all I<br/>care. If you start from the assumption that I don&apos;t write idiotic<br/>gibberish, problems can be sorted out with just a small amount of<br/>thinking.</p></div>
