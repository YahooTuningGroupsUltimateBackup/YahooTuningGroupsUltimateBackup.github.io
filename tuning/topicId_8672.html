I read the latest<br/>Digest on the Archives, and just had to say two<br/>things.  Would you please post this for me?</p><p>1)<br/>Re: the I-IV-V7-I cadence in different tunings</p><p>I had meant to mention something else about my MIDI<br/>file experiment in the post in which I described<br/>my own reactions to the different tunigns.</p><p>I hope others can hear this also.  My setup uses<br/>an AWE64Value soundcard and it is clearly audible:</p><p>Even tho the &apos;reed organ&apos; patch I used here has<br/>no vibrato, in 2 of the tunings - the 12-EDO and<br/>the meantone - the I and IV chords have an interesting<br/>&apos;chorusing&apos; effect.  This effect is completely absent<br/>from the other tunings, which all use JI 4:5:6 for<br/>those chords.</p><p>My guess: the timbre of the &apos;reed organ&apos; patch must<br/>have a strong 5th harmonic (and/or its multiples)<br/>that causes those overtones of the &apos;root&apos; (1/1 or<br/>4/3, respectively) to clash with the 12-EDO or<br/>meantone &apos;major 3rd&apos;.</p><p>2)<br/>Re: Jerry Eskelin&apos;s &apos;high 3rd&apos; mp3</p><p>I listened to Jerry Eskelin&apos;s mp3 of the &apos;high 3rd&apos;<br/>experiment sung by his choir.  I&apos;m really glad Jerry<br/>included those interjected &apos;E&apos;s played on the piano,<br/>because (assuming the piano is indeed tuned close<br/>to exact 12-EDO) comparison of the &apos;E&apos;s sung by the<br/>singers does indeed prove that they start at a pitch<br/>which is lower than 12-EDO, and that after the &apos;G&apos;<br/>is added the pitch of &apos;E&apos; rises to above 12-EDO.</p><p>I think it&apos;s fair to say that when it&apos;s only the<br/>&apos;C&apos; and &apos;E&apos; dyad, the &apos;E&apos; is approximating a 4:5.<br/>Now regarding where that &apos;E&apos; ends up...</p><p>I compared my MIDI-file version of this<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/monzo/high3rd.mid</a><br/>with Jerry&apos;s mp3, and to me it sounds like Jerry&apos;s<br/>singers aren&apos;t ending up on *any* of the &apos;E&apos;s in<br/>my MIDI version.</p><p>But I think that the 24/19 &apos;E&apos; [= ~404 cents] comes<br/>closest to what they sing.  All the &apos;E&apos;s higher than<br/>that in my MIDI-file sound too sharp, edging up<br/>towards a &apos;suspended 4th&apos; sound, in comparison to<br/>Jerry&apos;s mp3.  And of course, the 12-EDO &apos;E&apos; [400<br/>cents] is not high enough, as proven by the piano.</p><p>Now that I&apos;ve heard Jerry&apos;s actual experiment, here&apos;s<br/>something very important to consider: this triad has<br/>the &apos;3rd&apos; on top and the &apos;5th&apos; in the middle.  So the<br/>simple starting proportions approximate *not* 4:5:6,<br/>but rather 2:3:5, sung on the recording in the order<br/>2 - 5 - 3.</p><p>I say that this is an important difference, because<br/>IMO most likely what is happening with the ending<br/>pitch of the &apos;high 3rd&apos; is that some kind of<br/>interaction concerning summation and/or difference<br/>tones is making the singers sharpen the &apos;3rd&apos; so<br/>that it blends in better (or perhaps one should<br/>just say &apos;finds a different way to blend nicely&apos;,<br/>since 2:3:5 *does* provide a great blend<br/>mathematically!) with the 2:3 [= C:G] after<br/>the &apos;G&apos; comes in.  The math is somewhat different<br/>with the &apos;high 3rd&apos; on top instead of in the middle.</p><p>Busy packing now, there&apos;s no way I can spend any<br/>more time on this.  Hopefully some of the<br/>mathematicians will chew on this for a while,<br/>so that there will be plenty on the subject for<br/>me to read when I re-subscribe!</p><p>-monz<br/>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!

The math is somewhat different<br/>&gt;with the &apos;high 3rd&apos; on top instead of in the middle.</p><p>Joe, interactions involving difference tones (or summation tones, which are<br/>almost never audible) favor the simplest possible otonal representation for<br/>the chord, since then, and only then, will the combinational tones all form<br/>simple ratios with the chord tones. My feeling is that Wim&apos;s way of thinking<br/>is on the right track: the soprano will tend to &quot;disappear&quot; into the chord<br/>if singing a just major tenth over the bass (2:5 or 1:5), while she will<br/>&quot;stand out&quot; if she sharpens it a little, the rootedness of the chord being<br/>secure due to that 2:3 perfect fifth below her.</p><p>I was going to say, &quot;Anyhow, hopefully someone can analyze Jerry&apos;s mp3 and<br/>determine exactly what intervals are in this chord.&quot; But then I listened to<br/>it. It&apos;s a mess. Each singer is wavering within a large band, and the fact<br/>that multiple singers are singing the &quot;same&quot; pitch, creating erratic beats<br/>with one another (in addition to the technical problem of distinguishing<br/>overtones of low notes from fundamentals of high notes, and dealing with the<br/>beats between the two), is going to make a precise analysis of the intervals<br/>impossible (please don&apos;t let that stop anyone from trying to get some<br/>approximate cent numbers, though!). If this is what Jerry considers<br/>&quot;locking&quot;, I suggest he re-evaluate his position on the ~1&#xFFFD; accuracy of some<br/>synthesizers being insufficient to find the true &quot;locking&quot; intervals. Or is<br/>this just a &quot;student&quot; choir?</p></div>
