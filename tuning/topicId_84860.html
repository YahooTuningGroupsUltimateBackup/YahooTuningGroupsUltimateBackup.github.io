The musical styles to succeed will tend to be popular, i.e. non-classical and with a beat - but then again.... its up to the composer&apos;s ability.</p><p>Here are the particulars</p><p> SoOn is sponsoring a competition in the spirit of the Scene compo tradition and to make it a bit more interesting we&acirc;Â€Â™ll buy you a beer (or two) if you end up in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place.</p><p>1st place prize is $20<br/>2nd place prize is $10<br/>3rd place prize is $5</p><p>Here are the rules:</p><p>1. You must use at least 10 seconds of one or more of the 10 samples provided. This sample must be identified (via test). But&acirc;Â€&brvbar;. You can time shift, reverse, transpose &acirc;Â€&quot; do anything you&acirc;Â€Â™d like in any software and throw it all together in any style with any additional sounds you desire. Do something glorious &acirc;Â€&quot; make a mockery of the contest &acirc;Â€&quot; it doesn&acirc;Â€Â™t matter &acirc;Â€&quot; whatever is best wins!</p><p>There are samples at this profile</p><p><a href="http://www.traxinspace.com/profile/2009sooncontest">http://www.traxinspace.com/profile/2009sooncontest</a></p><p>Or at this URL</p><p><a href="http://2009contest.soonlabel.com">http://2009contest.soonlabel.com</a></p><p>2. Prize payment will be made via paypal &acirc;Â€&quot; that is where I have the money for this event stored. If you can&acirc;Â€Â™t get a free account then I can&acirc;Â€Â™t help you.</p><p>3. A minimum of five (5) entries are needed to trigger payment of the prizes.</p><p>4. Entries are open until 23:59:59 October 31st 2009 GMT</p><p>5. Voting starts 00:00:00 November 1st 2009 GMT and ends November 7th 2009 GMT</p><p>6. Voting will be tallied by Tricky on TiS.

Entry URLs will be posted to this thread by the entrant or Tricky or myself. Email 2009vote at <a href="http://soonlabel.com">soonlabel.com</a> with your URL if you do not have or want a TiS account.</p><p>8. SoOn members are eligible to compete &acirc;Â€&quot; only I can&acirc;Â€Â™t since it&acirc;Â€Â™s my money and that would make little sense&acirc;Â€&brvbar;. Wouldn&acirc;Â€Â™t it?</p><p>9. I&acirc;Â€Â™d like to thank all of the SoOn members who contributed samples for the contest</p><p>I think that covers it.</p></div>
