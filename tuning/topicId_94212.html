The rotation of the lattice can be automated, and the corresponding tuning changes are sent---via MIDI CC20 (coarse) and CC21 (fine)---to a Dynamic Tonality synthesizer (like 2032).</p><p>The number of small and large steps of an MOS can be specified, and this determines the number of black and white notes. For example, specifying 5 large and 2 small steps gives the familiar seven white diatonic notes, and five black chromatic notes; specifying 3 large and 7 small gives a magic MOS scale with ten white notes and three black notes (the notes available in the next higher-cardinality MOS scale).</p><p>2032 uses modal synthesis---a bank of resonant filters (modes) are excited by a variety of different excitation models. As such, it can provide quite realistic simulations of acoustic instruments, but it can produce quite novel sounds too.</p><p>As a Dynamic Tonality synthesizer, it has a few simple parameters to facilitate the exploration of tunings. The main tuning slider controls the size of the generator (over the range 0 - 1200 cents). The Tone Diamond&apos;s left-right axis allows the partials of any sound to be moved towards one that matches the underlying tuning; its up-down axis allows the 2-D tuning (octave + generator) to be moved towards one of two related 3-D (5-limit just intonation) tunings.</p><p>For example, the tuning can be moved smoothly between the diatonic scale generated by a fifth (of any size), and a JI diatonic scale of 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8 (bottom of the Tone Diamond) or a JI diatonic scale of 1/1, 10/9, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 15/8 (top of the Tone Diamond). For any of these tunings, the spectrum of the tones can be dynamically changed between fully harmonic (left of the Tone Diamond) and fully matched to the tuning (right of the Tone Diamond).</p><p>To trigger a specific note in 2032, we map from MIDI note number and Channel numbers 1-5 (we&apos;ll post the mappings to the website shortly). 2032 can also be played with a computer QWERTY keyboard (using a Wicki/Thummer layout).</p><p>These two applications form part of a suite of compositional tools for Dynamic Tonality, which includes Hex, 2032, The Viking, and Bill Sethares&apos; TransFormSynth---the latter two will be updated soon to accept the MIDI CC20 and CC21 tuning messages from Hex (Viking is also currently being ported to Max to make it Mac compatible).</p><p>Hopefully you&apos;ll find them useful, fun, and inspiring to play with...</p><p>Â…if you have any questions please ask.</p></div><h3><a id=94223 href="#94223">ðŸ”—</a>sevishmusic &#x3C;sevish@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/4/2010 1:09:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Andy,</p><p>Hex looks very cool...
