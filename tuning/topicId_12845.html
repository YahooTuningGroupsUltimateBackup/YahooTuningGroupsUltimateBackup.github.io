(I wouldn&apos;t trust that part of the memory, would you?),<br/>anyway, this instrument was alleged to be a triple-reed affair and the<br/>researchers&apos; guesstimate was that the three reeds played notes that were a<br/>major ninth apart, like G1, A2, B3. So I guess, going the other way, &quot;Three<br/>Blind Mice&quot; has been with us for quite a spell. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>Jay<br/>At 10:44 PM 9/15/00 +0100, you wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;This is slightly off topic, but interesting nonetheless. Anthropologists in<br/>England (Cambridge<br/>&gt;University) are looking into the very real possibility that &quot;cavemen&quot;, as<br/>the radio programme<br/>&gt;reported, used pitches and rhythm to communicate , vocally and<br/>instrumentally,  before the<br/>&gt;constructs of human speech had been established. I&apos;m sorry that I don&apos;t<br/>have any references to<br/>&gt;the researchers as I gleaned this from a half -listened -to breakfast radio<br/>report by the<br/>&gt;BBC.  Some sort of early instruments with definite piches had been<br/>discovered and this led to<br/>&gt;the research.<br/>&gt;I just thought that this might provide some  relief for the list regulars<br/>in speculating what<br/>&gt;kind of scales early humanoids might haveused. Now wouldn&apos;t it screw things<br/>up for all of us<br/>&gt;if they found evidence of the use of 12-tet?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;You do not need web access to participate.

I doubt that prehistoric instruments allowed such<br/>precision that a fifth of 700c could be chosen over 702c (Pythagorean), or<br/>695c (19-TET). Troglodytes were not known to have employed logarithms. Even<br/>if a 12-tone scale had been the mode, I assume a capella singers of that<br/>time (as now) would have preferred just intonation, Pythagorean tuning, or<br/>well temperament over equal temperament. Equal temperament lends itself only<br/>to harmonic modulation, which seems a modern development.</p><p>It is even conceivable that glissando was preferred to steady pitch. I&apos;d be<br/>surprised if vibrato developed that early.</p><p>Aren&apos;t some caves (in the Phillipines or the Caucasus Mountains or<br/>somewhere) still used as housing today? If so, do we know what scales are<br/>used by contemporary cave-dwellers? Are the acoustics of housing relevant to<br/>the discussion?</p><p>-- Charlie Jordan &lt;<a href="http://www.rev.net/people/aloe/tuning">http://www.rev.net/people/aloe/tuning</a>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=12899 href="#12899">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/17/2000 8:57:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, ALOE@R... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12891">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/12891</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; To my knowledge, birds and whales have communicated with rhythm and<br/>pitch sequences (melodies?) for a verly long time.
