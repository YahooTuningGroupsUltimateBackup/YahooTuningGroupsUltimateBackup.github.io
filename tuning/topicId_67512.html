That&apos;s Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>group, as many of you know.  They were quite good.  I really enjoyed<br/>their playing, especially the first tunes.  I had the feeling they<br/>were maybe playing it a bit more &quot;straight&quot; than some of the more<br/>experimental things I had heard in the past, and I didn&apos;t hear many<br/>microtones... at least not *intentional* ones.  I also didn&apos;t hear as<br/>many complex (international) Middle Eastern rhythms, which I<br/>remembered from the past.</p><p>But, nevertheless, the club was cool... even classy with big<br/>chandeliers and a nice vibe.  They played at what I considered a<br/>reasonable volume level as well...</p><p>Paul seems to be taking quite a bit of the lead guitar work these<br/>days, even though he said later that it was supposed to be &quot;half and<br/>half...&quot;  His &quot;guitar chops&quot; are really happening now, so it seems....</p><p>Good going, Paul!</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2006 10:27:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for writing in JP.
