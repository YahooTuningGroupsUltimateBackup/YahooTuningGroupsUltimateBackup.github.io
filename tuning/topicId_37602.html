I<br/>don&apos;t remember exactly *what*, what harmonies or whatever.  But regardless,<br/>at that point, it definitely impressed me as a passage that was trying to<br/>submerge just intonation into equal temperament.  I do this in my music a<br/>LOT of the time so it&apos;s one of the microtonal effects I&apos;m more attuned to<br/>than other things.</p><p>As many times as Johnny and I have compared and contrasted the way we listen<br/>to music, as far as what we &quot;hear&quot;, I can imagine how he might have heard<br/>&quot;Blackjack&quot;.  Johnny might not have caught the Just effect in conjuction<br/>with the amount of scurrying the keyboard was doing; I would think for his<br/>hearing, the overall context might have been a little obscured.</p><p>I&apos;ve sort of desensitized to faster notes, though.  I let a lot of that<br/>keyboard fade back, the faster parts.  It could have been completely random<br/>atonal free pitch, and it wouldn&apos;t have changed the fact that as soon as the<br/>trombone started playing very lengthy note durations, I sensed an<br/>application of JI.  I mean, I haven&apos;t messed with 72 much but I *have* at<br/>some point heard what a the just harmonies sound like and I seemed to notice<br/>that&apos;s where the horn was headed.</p><p>I never would have thought of it otherwise, but there&apos;s a bit of similarity<br/>here between this piece and the 1st movement of the piece I played that<br/>night, at least in terms of the effects I was describing:  a lot of my main<br/>theme was slow, strict just intonation mapped to 49, then the departure<br/>section involved the instruments becoming more disjunct, faster, and more<br/>hysterical melodically, until they terrorized each other into harmonizing<br/>near-4-equal diminished chords.  (If I was listening to this from the<br/>audience, I would have paid about as much less attention to the faster<br/>passage.)</p><p>Trilling slippery diminished chords in 49.  I HOPE that no one took THAT too<br/>seriously.   Ultimately that was a goof on bad horror movies, or maybe soap<br/>operas... &quot;I&apos;m not only your father, I&apos;m also... (suspense)...

I&apos;ve found if you try to<br/>force<br/>&gt; some Just relations, you wind up finding out a little quicker what<br/>makes<br/>&gt; that temperament so different, and you can see where it&apos;s going to<br/>wind up<br/>&gt; on its own.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I never really had a solid thing to say about it, but something<br/>like this:<br/>&gt; I think more that if you want Just, play Just, it&apos;s perfect.  If<br/>you don&apos;t,<br/>&gt; since Just is perfect, whatever you&apos;re playing, try to play Just a<br/>little,<br/>&gt; see how it works, then see where it wanders to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As many times as I&apos;ve heard JI compared to nature, I would think a<br/>little,<br/>&gt; equal temperaments are how nature is challenged by manmade<br/>elements.  Some<br/>&gt; preserve it, some destroy it.  I have nothing against the people<br/>who present<br/>&gt; the pure nature.  I just have a lot of interest in the challenge,<br/>how<br/>&gt; temperaments warp Just, as far as Just is concerned.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; marC</p><p>****Hi Marc!</p><p>Thanks for your contributions to this thread.  Well... certainly my<br/>*objective* is to get as close to Just as possible, at least that&apos;s<br/>why *I* am using 72-tET.</p><p>However, I&apos;ve decided that in order to *train* 12-tET musicians to<br/>play it, the easiest way is through 72-tET.  Now, I may be wrong<br/>there, but it&apos;s my present attitude.  I figure if people only have to<br/>learn *three* new intervals (1/6 whole tone, 1/12 whole tone and<br/>quartertones) it will be easier than having them digest some kind of<br/>*ratio* nomenclature.  In fact, I don&apos;t think some of the players I<br/>want to work with would do it.  Some people find even 72-<br/>tET &quot;hard...&quot; if they haven&apos;t been exposed to it before.</p><p>Now, for people like Kraig Grady who, to my knowledge, is more<br/>interested in *building* and playing perfectly just instruments, it<br/>makes perfectly good sense to go for the *true just.*  I don&apos;t think,<br/>though, that Kraig is so interested in getting &quot;traditional&quot; players<br/>to play his stuff, although I could be wrong.  Similarly for people,<br/>maybe even like *yourself* who seem to be interested in alternate<br/>electronics and modified instruments (guitars) a compromise would<br/>also be counterproductive.</p><p>So, I guess it has mostly to do with the composer&apos;s *objectives.*  In<br/>a sense I&apos;m &quot;settling&quot; for 72-tET since I feel I can&apos;t really *get*<br/>pure Justice so easily with certain players.</p><p>Maybe I&apos;m wrong there, but that&apos;s what I&apos;m thinking, anyway.  So,<br/>it&apos;s essentially a *COMPROMISE* and those who dislike compromise<br/>aren&apos;t going to like this approach.</p><p>By the way, what do people think of Ted Mook&apos;s realization of Harry<br/>Partch&apos;s _Li Po_ songs using 72-tET??</p><p>I bet some people don&apos;t like that.  Surely *Partch* wouldn&apos;t have<br/>liked it, but Ted feels it&apos;s an acceptable way to play Just... I<br/>think...</p><p>Joe P.</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/12/2002 3:32:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello johnny!<br/>    So this implies that Novaro was the first to use 72 on the zither he<br/>made (had made!)</p><p><a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; p.s.
