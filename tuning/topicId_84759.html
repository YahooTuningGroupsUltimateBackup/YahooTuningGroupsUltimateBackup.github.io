In<br/>the course of stumbling about, I analyze all the<br/>intervals in the tuning, and take note of basic<br/>things such as circle of fifths progressions and<br/>tritone resolutions, working out some possibilities<br/>as I play around.</p><p>I write down the notes I play, not the pitches that<br/>sound. This is the easiest way for these keyboard<br/>pieces (as opposed to writing for Tonal Plexus,<br/>where I use the MegaStaff notation). I label the<br/>intervals that sound, and make a catalog of all<br/>the intervals, Nm2, W5, etc. (my system names)</p><p>Once my ears are accustomed to the sound of<br/>the tuning and I have some of those basic things<br/>written down, I start going for some material and<br/>get a few ideas on paper I feel are worthwhile.</p><p>After I have a few ideas there on paper, I move to<br/>the computer and start a piece proper using notation<br/>software + Scordatura (previously I had used TBX1<br/>there too, but it&apos;s easier to use Scordatura). Once<br/>I&apos;m at the computer, I&apos;m just using the mouse like<br/>a pencil to enter notes, and I write pretty freely,<br/>just following my ear.</p><p>This piece in particular is not very unified in terms<br/>of material or form. One listener so far described<br/>the sound as &quot;drunken&quot;, which is funny and says<br/>something about the uncertain character of this<br/>tuning when used for tonal counterpoint. There are<br/>intrinsic reasons why the tuning sounds this way,<br/>the details of which could easily fill a book.</p><p>18ET has great potential for whole tone based music<br/>because it allows interesting modulation between 3<br/>whole tone scales, and I also came up with some<br/>material along those lines, but that doesn&apos;t fit<br/>stylistically with what I want to do for the Equal<br/>Tempered Keyboard project, so I left it for later.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>AAH<br/>=====</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Ozan Yarman &lt;ozanyarman@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sebastian Bach, eat your heart out...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron Andrew, this is superb!

I admire your polyphonic works, you are able to work with additional notes in octave in various ET in quite natural way and make something new from it based on something old. Which is always good way - not pure experiment, not pure eclecticism, but well balanced. Compliments! Keep your way, I&apos;m looking forward to whole tone piece. I&apos;m sure you will find an interesting solution of this compositional challenge. 18 ET offers interesting relations, besides 6+6+6 it can be divided into 9+9, 3+4+5+6, 5+6+7... I can imagine also creating some subsets with distinguished different intervals, and use modes of it or modulations, or selecting  size of the scale different from octave periodicity...</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 22 Sep 2009, at 2:41 AM, hpiinstruments wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Daniel.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree that whole tone in 12ET gets boring very fast,<br/>&gt; but my point was that 18ET breathes new life into<br/>&gt; ideas based on whole tones.

It may end up from<br/>that point of view sounding like &quot;out of tune counterpoint&quot;<br/>and in some cases it does sound that way to me, but on<br/>the whole, I am doing things in each piece which only that<br/>tuning is capable of doing, so it is not simply a useless<br/>exercise in transferral of well known ideas to a new scale -<br/>far from it - rather a way to investigate new territory using<br/>a familiar language.

I did not use this of course explicitly,<br/>but I did use patterns which modulate to 1/3 tone above<br/>or below where expected, which is the same phenomenon<br/>shown in that double octave pattern.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>AAH<br/>=====</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forro &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi, Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; you are right that this approach can bring interesting results,<br/>&gt; especially when somebody with your compositional skill will work on<br/>&gt; it.

All of a sudden those boring<br/>&gt; &gt; static sounds can become interesting again, because as Oz<br/>&gt; &gt; pointed out, 18ET has the &quot;delicious&quot; third-tone interval,<br/>&gt; &gt; and modulating around with those becomes exciting,<br/>&gt; &gt; particularly because whole tones in 18 are exactly the same<br/>&gt; &gt; as 12, so they set up an expectation for something static<br/>&gt; &gt; and boring, and then - bam! that was different! Not sure<br/>&gt; &gt; how far it could go, remaining affective, since I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; tried a piece proper... challenge to list members - maybe<br/>&gt; &gt; Chris will oblige?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Since whole tone structures include incomplete dominant<br/>&gt; &gt; seventh chords or more characteristically augmented<br/>&gt; &gt; dominants, and by proxy French augmented sixths, I was<br/>&gt; &gt; also saying it would be interesting if the substantial<br/>&gt; &gt; material is based on whole tones, but by noting modulation<br/>&gt; &gt; with third-tones I meant to say that things should not be<br/>&gt; &gt; strictly limited to whole tones; that would be pointless.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Last note, 18ET also works great for standard blues. And<br/>&gt; &gt; try playing James Brown&apos;s &quot;I Feel Good&quot; in 18; the neighbor<br/>&gt; &gt; tones are killer!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I fiddled with this tuning for a long time before writing<br/>&gt; &gt; anything, so I have sketch material for all kinds of stuff,<br/>&gt; &gt; one of which is a blues in 5/8 I might turn into a piece at<br/>&gt; &gt; some point.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; &gt; AAH<br/>&gt; &gt; =====<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forro &lt;dan.for@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;m afraid whole tone scale itself doesn&apos;t offer too much<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; possibilities for composition, as everything sounds the same in it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And it was used so much in the music of the past that it&apos;s almost<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; unusable if you want to write New music based only on it.
