Other Minds Festivals remind everyone how satisfying and<br/>&gt;thrilling modern music at its most communicative can be.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Composers featured at OM 8 are:  Ellen Fullman (Seattle); Takashi Harada<br/>&gt;(Japan); Lou Harrison (Aptos, CA); Tania Le&oacute;n (New York, b. Cuba); Annea<br/>&gt;Lockwood (New York, b. New Zealand), in collaboration with Thomas Buckner<br/>&gt;(New York); Pauline Oliveros (New York); Ricardo Tacuchian (Brazil); Richard<br/>&gt;Teitelbaum (New York); and Randy Weston (New York).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Characterized by an eclectic range of musical presentations,  Other Minds<br/>&gt;Festivals bring to Bay Area audiences some of the most exciting performers<br/>&gt;and listening experiences in contemporary music.  OM 8 salutes Lou<br/>&gt;Harrison&apos;s 85th birthday (May 14, 2002) with a world premiere for National<br/>&gt;steel guitar solo and two major new keyboard works.  Also honored as<br/>&gt;ground-breaking figures in the world of musical exploration are &quot;Deep<br/>&gt;Listening&quot; icon Pauline Oliveros (on the occasion of her 70th birthday, May<br/>&gt;30, 2002), and virtuoso jazz pianist-composer Randy Weston (who celebrated<br/>&gt;his 75th birthday on April 6, 2001), both of whom also present world<br/>&gt;premieres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;A highlight of OM 8 will be Ellen Fullman&apos;s sound sculpture-a 90-foot long<br/>&gt;string instrument of encompassing resonance-installed in the Palace of Fine<br/>&gt;Arts Theatre for her world premiere with the Kronos Quartet of a work<br/>&gt;commissioned by Other Minds for the 2002 festival.  Takashi Harada is a<br/>&gt;virtuoso of the Ondes Martenot - an electronic orchestral instrument of<br/>&gt;otherworldly tones that made its debut at the Paris Opera in 1928 - will<br/>&gt;perform his own works and others composed for the rare instrument.  The<br/>&gt;festival presents compositions for guitar and keyboard by Ricardo Tacuchian,<br/>&gt;major force in Brazilian classical music and developer of the T-system,<br/>&gt;based on a scale of nine tones.  Works by brilliant Cuban-born composer and<br/>&gt;conductor Tania Le&oacute;n will be performed by baritone Thomas Buckner and the<br/>&gt;New York-based ensemble Continuum, which is known for its wide repertoire of<br/>&gt;contemporary music from all parts of the world.  Buckner also appears with<br/>&gt;Annea Lockwood as co-composer and performer of &quot;Duende,&quot; merging live vocals<br/>&gt;and electronic music.  (Lockwood is notorious for past performances that<br/>&gt;included torching a piano and electronically amplifying its demise, and<br/>&gt;dropping a piano from a helicopter.)  Highly revered avant-garde composer<br/>&gt;and accordionist Pauline Oliveros presents a world premiere with The Circle<br/>&gt;Trio, made possible in part by a grant from the Zellerbach Family Fund, as<br/>&gt;well as a work for keyboard performed by Sarah Cahill.  Richard Teitelbaum<br/>&gt;integrates diverse sound sources as he combines electronic sounds of the<br/>&gt;Kurzweil synthesizer with solo shakuhachi.

There, the audience is invited to feast and<br/>&gt;visit with other new and world music advocates, including the Other Minds<br/>&gt;composers, performers and friends, and browse through hard-to-find<br/>&gt;recordings and books available for purchase.  Stilt-walking dancer Pamela<br/>&gt;Wunderlich, an audience favorite at last year&apos;s Festival, adds to the mix<br/>&gt;with an encore appearance before each concert and at intermission nightly in<br/>&gt;her elaborate sculptural costumes.

The annual new music festival,<br/>&gt;presenting today&apos;s most innovative composers in concerts and discussion, has<br/>&gt;become one of the most important events on the international new music<br/>&gt;calendar, and offers Bay Area audiences an up-to-the-minute report on the<br/>&gt;increasingly borderless realms of classical, experimental, jazz, world, and<br/>&gt;electronic music, as well as new and emerging forms.  Other Minds Festivals<br/>&gt;are known for their international scope, incorporation of new technologies,<br/>&gt;multidisciplinary collaborations, and tradition of encouraging relatively<br/>&gt;unknown but gifted young composers.  Presented in association with the<br/>&gt;Djerassi Resident Artists Program, the festival concerts are preceded by<br/>&gt;four days of private sessions at the Djerassi Program in Woodside, giving<br/>&gt;the composers a rare chance to discuss critical questions in depth and to<br/>&gt;get to know one another on a more personal basis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Other Minds&apos; mission is furthered by its exhaustive documentation efforts;<br/>&gt;CD projects, including recent issues of music by George Antheil, Igor<br/>&gt;Stravinsky, and Conlon Nancarrow, with a forthcoming release of the music of<br/>&gt;Ezra Pound; musical archives; a content-rich website -<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.otherminds.org">http://www.otherminds.org</a> - soon to include live webcasting; informative<br/>&gt;newsletter; and collaboration with other organizations to present innovative<br/>&gt;musical programs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Other Minds continues an ongoing collaboration with the San Francisco<br/>&gt;Symphony.  In December 2001 Michael Tilson Thomas led the SF Symphony in the<br/>&gt;world premiere of Ice Field (2001) for multiple orchestras by Henry Brant.<br/>&gt;Commissioned by Other Minds, Ice Field is a spatial composition for nearly<br/>&gt;100 musicians who were arranged throughout Davies Symphony Hall, with the<br/>&gt;88-year-old composer improvising on the mighty Ruffatti pipe organ.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Other Minds 2001-2002 programs are made possible in part by the BMI<br/>&gt;Foundation, the Ann &amp; Gordon Getty Foundation, Grants for the Arts/San<br/>&gt;Francisco Hotel Tax Fund, William &amp; Flora Hewlett Foundation, Phaedrus<br/>&gt;Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation Creativity and Culture Program,<br/>&gt;Rockefeller Foundation MAP Fund, San Francisco Arts Commission, Thendara<br/>&gt;Foundation, Zellerbach Family Fund, and Other Minds&apos; donor circle, A<br/>&gt;Gathering of Other Minds.
