Apparently some people on the tuning list have been bothered to high heaven by this statement, but I don&apos;t give a damn. I compared 12tet to white sugar and coffee, not nerve gas, anthrax, and Republicanism. I&apos;m not a Chicken Little raving that the walls are going to come tumbling down if we don&apos;t switch. I try to avoid white sugar, beef, and 12tet whenever possible, which it often isn&apos;t. I do, however, enjoy coffee and cigars, and if I enjoyed 12tet as much as I enjoy Maker&apos;s Mark, I wouldn&apos;t have the self-discipline to give it up. The comment is a source of much entertainment to the out-of-context-quoting nabobs of the tuning list, and it will remain.</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=40872 href="#40872">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/14/2002 9:37:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;jwerntz2002&quot; &lt;juliawerntz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_40814.html#40857">/tuning/topicId_40814.html#40857</a></p><p>It is about how<br/>&gt; much heartache and loneliness there can be when the musical<br/>establishment in our<br/>&gt; country rejects over and over again the very idea of microtonal<br/>music (of any<br/>&gt; kind).

In other words, as you play through a piece, there&apos;s a quasi-random variation in out-of-tuneness, some intervals being just fine and others awful. Whereas, I love to play through Baroque music in meantone - there&apos;s a lovely consistency between one chord and the next, even with the fifths noticeably out of tune. And Bach and Beethoven are fascinating to play through in well temperament, because they will get very different effects in different keys. The second movement of Beethoven&apos;s Appassionata, for instance, being in D-flat, is really buzzy because of the D-flat/F interval, but in that context the wide major third provides a sparkle without which the music begins to sag. Play that same movement in C instead of D-flat, and it loses something, and sounds a little lifeless. There is certainly a place in music for buzzy intervals - Indonesian gamelan relies heavily on them. (I can add, though, that we have a Balinese gamelan here on campus, and the racket it produces can drive everyone here wild under sustained exposure, which probably has a little to do with the intentional inharmonicity between the pairs of instruments.) But the music, for me, needs to be closely aligned with, or attuned to, the tuning in which it is played. And 12tet just isn&apos;t aligned with anything, because there is virtually no music written - except for perhaps certain 12-tone pieces, such as a few by Webern filled with major sevenths and tritones - in which the choice of harmonies is made closely according to the amount of beating in the intervals. I don&apos;t get that harsh feeling from Baroque music played in meantone or classical-era music played in well temperament, although even well temperament can take a little getting used to after several weeks of JI. And of course, most of the time 12tet sounds fine, because I don&apos;t get more than three or four weeks a year in which I can really immerse myself in pure intervals. It&apos;s in the transition from pure intervals to badly tempered ones that I suddenly realize what I&apos;m missing most of the time. I can get a wonderful feeling of calm and interiority and immersion in the music from working for several days in tunings in which the intervals are all within two or three cents of just. It&apos;s disappointing to give that up.</p><p>It does seem to me that, as long as you are conditioned to hear only the fundamentals and filter out the beats, any tuning can sound fine. But once you&apos;ve conditioned yourself to hear the interaction of partials, as a piano tuner does, certain combinations begin to grate on you, especially if there&apos;s no sensitivity to where in the music they appear.</p><p>Thanks for acknowledging that there are different things one can listen for in music.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=40914 href="#40914">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/16/2002 1:19:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>jwerntz2002 wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  But for me it&apos;s not about the<br/>&gt; courage to &quot;resist&quot; our &quot;culture&quot; in the sense that you describe it.

Only I&apos;d probably complain about the tuning<br/>of the plainsong.</p><p>I&apos;ve just been refused funding from the Scottish Arts Council under their music bursaries scheme<br/>for &quot;the creation and development of new work&quot;. I proposed a set of five substantial compositions<br/>to be written throughout next year, in Just Intonation and 22 tet, involving new instruments,<br/>conventional instruments and voice, electronics and guitar. I&apos;d have thought that a combination of<br/>new instruments with new timbres in new tunings playing new compositions was , well , new, but<br/>obviously not new enough. So, disappointed but not bitter, I&apos;ve asked for details on the<br/>successful applications so that I can figure out where microtonality stands in the scheme of<br/>things, whether its worth continuing with my efforts, and if so how best to promote the music. One<br/>example of a successful project, though not in music was a &iuml;&iquest;&half;1,500 grant towards an internet based<br/>animation exploring the use of UltraViolet light in tanning female skin!</p><p>Most of the music successes in the past seem to have been indie style pop bands, possibly because<br/>of their commercial potential (the boss-man of the Arts Council is an accountant) but I need to<br/>see what they&apos;ve funded this time round to get a fix on current trends. Not that that will make me<br/>follow the trend, but it is a good time to take stock and work out if I should continue the<br/>compositions under my own steam - or go into opera which receives about 80% of the total budget<br/>each year.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s my bleating over and done and I&apos;m glad that I have a place to bleat and whine. It is<br/>however most interesting to feel a direct emotional link with the sentiments expressed by Julia<br/>and to consider the importance that official recognition has in our chosen field.

Most of these reaction have been from live music and until now i can say i have<br/>never felt the positive reaction from recordings. Except once when listening to an extremely long<br/>Balinese shadow performance. I also became aware of sometype of &quot;low Fundamental&quot; generated by this<br/>music. Actually a low common difference tone would be more exact. Other world music has touched upon<br/>this which has kept my mind open to there is more than one way to get into this type of space, or<br/>that there are many similar rhelms of  such experience. Often even in club some bands will produce<br/>quite pleasant washes while others are nothing less than painful. Although close to 12 ET little<br/>remains intact in such arena. On the other hand i must say that Glenn Branca JI works were quite<br/>tolerable than any 12 ET music at the same volume. Some works in the most grating ETS have really<br/>gotten to me more than once.<br/>    James Brown should be considered a national treasure. Where is his McArthur? I would imagine that<br/>live this music would be quite enjoyable and uplifting.<br/>    In referance to Alsion complaint, i have produced a sizable amount of work which is recieved<br/>quite well where i am. I recieve no funding and grants in 25 + years have been none.

In other words, as<br/>you<br/>&gt; play through a piece, there&apos;s a quasi-random variation in<br/>&gt; out-of-tuneness, some intervals being just fine and others<br/>awful.<br/>&gt; Whereas, I love to play through Baroque music in meantone -<br/>there&apos;s a<br/>&gt; lovely consistency between one chord and the next, even with<br/>the<br/>&gt; fifths noticeably out of tune.</p><p>it would seem that neither 1/4-comma nor 1/3-comma meantone<br/>would be ideal from this point of view, since each features a<br/>class of perfectly just consonances. baroque music is typically<br/>associated with meantones in the 1/5-comma to 1/6-comma<br/>range, which would of course be better for this &quot;consistency&quot;, as<br/>would the earliest meantone described with precision, zarlino&apos;s<br/>2/7-comma meantone. woolhouse&apos;s 7/26-comma and riccati&apos;s<br/>3/14-comma meantones may be still better choices if one wants<br/>to minimize the overall deviation from ji.</p><p>&gt;I can get a wonderful feeling of calm and<br/>&gt; interiority and immersion in the music from working for several<br/>days<br/>&gt; in tunings in which the intervals are all within two or three cents<br/>&gt; of just. It&apos;s disappointing to give that up.</p><p>the good news for the young pioneer, looking for a tuning system<br/>to make significant new music in, is that 72-equal fulfills both<br/>yours and julia&apos;s desiderata quite well.</p><p>&gt; It does seem to me that, as long as you are conditioned to<br/>hear only<br/>&gt; the fundamentals and filter out the beats, any tuning can sound<br/>fine.<br/>&gt; But once you&apos;ve conditioned yourself to hear the interaction of<br/>&gt; partials, as a piano tuner does, certain combinations begin to<br/>grate<br/>&gt; on you, especially if there&apos;s no sensitivity to where in the music<br/>&gt; they appear.</p><p>i think other factors are even more powerful than beats --<br/>combinational tones; and perhaps most of all, virtual pitch.</p></div><h3><a id=41323 href="#41323">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2002 2:54:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well that&apos;s so true and if it&apos;s any consolation it&apos;s no easier here<br/>in Scotland.
