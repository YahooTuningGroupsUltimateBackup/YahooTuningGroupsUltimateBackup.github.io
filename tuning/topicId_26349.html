I guess I should have posted it on the tuning group but I was<br/>concerned that maybe the question was alittle too basic. David was<br/>very helpful in helping me with an answer as well posting this<br/>question to everyone in the group.</p><p>I found a link on thge net that addresses this question and I thought<br/>I might share it with everyone. Here is the link<br/><a href="http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/andymilne/Scales.shtml#subdivision">http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/andymilne/Scales.shtml#subdivision</a></p><p>Please look on the left hand side of the above mentioned link. There<br/>you will find a table of contents. Look for &quot;Page Contents&quot; and<br/>beneath it you will see a topic called &quot;What is a Scale&quot;. I pasted<br/>the topic into this post in the event the link does not work for some<br/>tuning members. The link starts out with a topic called, &quot;subdivision<br/>of the Octave&quot; and then continues later with , &quot;What is a Scale&quot;.<br/>Please let me know what you think after reading this.</p><p>Thank You<br/>Walter    Here it is.......... Please scroll down to the</p><p>Subdivision of the octave</p><p>The mind perceives pitch to be continuously variable - there are<br/>no &quot;quanta&quot; of pitch - but in music, out of the infinite possible<br/>pitches that could be chosen from the pitch continuum, only a limited<br/>number are used.</p><p>Usually each octave is subdivided into a small number of steps and<br/>each of these is repeated in every octave. In almost all musical<br/>cultures notes separated by an octave are regarded as somehow<br/>equivalent, so that, for the sake of consistency and simplicity,<br/>divisions in any one octave are repeated in all others. Scales in<br/>which different notes are used in different octaves, or where octaves<br/>are not found at all, are rare.</p><p>By choosing a limited number of notes the ear is given a structure<br/>that is simple enough to be understandable and whose notes are spaced<br/>apart enough to be easily heard as different. Ideally within any<br/>octave, each note is perceived to be fundamentally different from<br/>every other note - each note has a unique identity. When that<br/>identity is unique enough it allows for each note&apos;s pitch to be<br/>varied with vibrato and other decorative techniques without losing<br/>its identity and becoming confused with other notes.</p><p>The pitches used in purely melodic musics - such as classical Arabic<br/>and Indian are generally more flexible and complex than those used in<br/>the tonal harmonic music of common practice classical and popular<br/>music. Within any one scale we will often find more than seven notes<br/>and the distance between consecutive steps can be very small.</p><p>But we also find in melodic music the frequent use of both the<br/>pentatonic scale - Celtic and Asian songs, and the seven note<br/>diatonic scale - Native American and African songs. These common<br/>scales often sound very different to how they do in tonal harmonic<br/>music, through generic forms of decoration and pitch variation.</p><p>On this site I will be examining in detail only those scales which<br/>are suitable for use in tonal harmonic music.</p><p>What is a scale ?</p><p>What is it that differentiates a &quot;scale&quot; from simply just<br/>a &quot;collection of notes&quot; ?</p><p>A scale should constitute a unified collection of notes - a selection<br/>which is in some sense complete and to which any addition is heard to<br/>be extraneous.</p><p>The scale must also fulfil the functions demanded of it. There are<br/>three principal functions that a scale may be asked to fulfil:</p><p>1) to serve as a melodic resource<br/>2) to serve as a harmonic resource<br/>3) to be tonally effective</p><p>It may fulfil any or all of these three functions - depending on its<br/>intended use.</p><p>The scale as a melodic resource</p><p>For a scale to be successful as a melodic resource it should be<br/>reasonably smooth and even; without sudden gaps which sound as if a<br/>note has been omitted, or sudden concentrations of notes which sound<br/>as if an extraneous note has been added.</p><p>One of the most important measures of the completeness of a scale is<br/>whether or not it can be classed as as a proper mode or not.</p><p>A mode (scale) is considered to be proper when all intervals of an<br/>interval class are not smaller than those of lower interval classes.<br/>This means, for example, that if we start on any note in the scale<br/>and move up four notes the interval traversed should be larger (or<br/>the same size as) any other interval made up from traversing three<br/>notes.</p><p>The propriety of a scale is a significant factor of scales which are<br/>recognised to be melodically smooth.</p><p>Another important measure is consistency of the size of intervals for<br/>each pitch class in the scale. The diatonic scale, for instance, has<br/>just two types of second - a major and a minor second, while the<br/>harmonic minor scale has three types of second - major, minor and<br/>augmented. This makes the diatonic scale melodically smoother than<br/>the harmonic minor.</p><p>The scale as a harmonic resource</p><p>In any harmonic music which uses major and minor triads, a suitable<br/>scale must be a resource not just for melody (notes in isolation) but<br/>for major and minor triads.</p><p>If we take major and minor triads to be the fundamental building<br/>blocks of our harmonic system then this means that if any note is not<br/>part of any major or minor triad then it is serving no harmonic<br/>purpose. It is therefore extraneous to the harmonic function of the<br/>scale, and so cannot be considered to be a unified member of that<br/>scale.</p><p>An example of such a &quot;scale&quot; is: c, d, e, f, g, g, a. Here the g is<br/>part of no triad, and so cannot be considered be a unified member of<br/>the scale.</p><p>The other requirement for a harmonic scale is that it should not<br/>contain any notes that allow for both a major and a minor triad to be<br/>built on the same root. This is because in any such scale one of<br/>these two possible thirds will always be heard as superfluous<br/>addition.</p><p>For example, in the &quot;scale&quot; c, d, e, f, g, a, a, b either the a or<br/>the a is entirely superfluous to the harmonic requirements of the<br/>scale.</p><p>This requirement forbids the use of any chromatic semitones in a<br/>fully unified scale.</p><p>Remarkably enough, out of all possible scales there are only five<br/>prime scales, in which every single note is a member of at least one<br/>major or minor triad and which contain no chromatic semitones. All of<br/>these scales contain seven notes.</p><p> The five prime scales<br/>The prime scales are those scales in which every note is a member of<br/>at least one major or minor triad, but which contain no chromatic<br/>semitones.</p><p>Each of the prime scales is best considered as a set of seven<br/>different scales or modes. Each mode of the prime scales contains the<br/>same notes but has a different &quot;home&quot; note or tonic.</p><p>Both the major scale and the natural minor scale are drawn from the<br/>same prime scale, and that prime scale is the diatonic scale. The<br/>difference between the major scale and the natural minor is<br/>their &quot;home&quot; or tonic note. If we take the notes c, d, e, f, g, a, b<br/>and treat c as the home note then we are using the scale of c major.<br/>If, however we take a as our home note then we are using the scale of<br/>a natural minor.</p><p>Indeed we can construct seven different scales from the diatonic<br/>scale by choosing each note as the home note. These seven scales are<br/>known as the seven diatonic modes. If we use the c major scale above,<br/>then the modes of it are as follows:</p><p>Tonic note Name of mode<br/>f f Lydian<br/>c c Ionian (or major)<br/>g g Mixolydian<br/>d d Dorian<br/>a a Aeolian (or natural minor)<br/>e e Phrygian<br/>b b Locrian</p><p>As I&apos;ve stated above there are five prime scales. Many of them do not<br/>have conventional names, so I have had to use the following<br/>descriptive terms.</p><p>The five prime scales are:</p><p>the diatonic<br/>the harmonic minor<br/>the harmonic major<br/>the melodic<br/>the double harmonic</p><p> Tonal harmonic scales<br/>There is one final requirement for a scale that is to be used as a<br/>resource for tonal harmonic music. Not only must it be a suitable<br/>resource for melody and triads but it must also be able to support a<br/>tonic triad. That is, it must have a chord which serves as a chord of<br/>rest and completion, as the tonal centre against which all the other<br/>triads are measured and towards which all gravitate.</p><p>Within each of the prime scales only one or, at most, two triads are<br/>actually capable of functioning as tonics.</p><p>So although any of the modes of the prime scales are suitable in a<br/>melodic music, in a tonal-harmonic music only one or, at most, two<br/>modes of each of the prime scales are suitable.</p><p>The diatonic scale, for instance, has only two triads which are<br/>perceived to be totally at rest, resolved and final. In the scale c,<br/>d, e, f, g, a, b these triads are C major and a minor.</p><p>This means that there are only two tonally effective scales to be<br/>taken from the diatonic prime - the major scale and the natural minor<br/>(or aeolian) scale.</p><p>In total there are eight tonal harmonic scales. I will examine in<br/>detail each of these scales under the prime scales from which they<br/>are derived:</p><p>The diatonic scales<br/>The major scale<br/>The aeolian mode<br/>The harmonic minor scale<br/>The harmonic major scale<br/>The melodic scales<br/>The (ascending) melodic minor scale<br/>The (descending) melodic major scale<br/>The double harmonic scales<br/>The double harmonic major scale<br/>The double harmonic minor scale</p><p>For an overview of effective cadential progressions in each of these<br/>tonal scales go to The Cadence Page.</p><p>END END END</p><p>Regards<br/>Walter</p></div><h3><a id=26351 href="#26351">ðŸ”—</a>X.

I am<br/>concerned that a composer could throw out a lot of<br/>valuable resources a priori if he blindly accepted some<br/>of the things said in that article.</p><p>&gt; Subdivision of the octave</p><p>&gt; Usually each octave is subdivided into a small number of<br/>&gt; steps and each of these is repeated in every octave. In<br/>&gt; almost all musical cultures notes separated by an octave are<br/>&gt; regarded as somehow equivalent, so that, for the sake of<br/>&gt; consistency and simplicity, divisions in any one octave are<br/>&gt; repeated in all others.</p><p>Ug not this octave stuff again. If octave is 1200.000<br/>cents, then his claim are certainly false.</p><p>&gt; Scales in which different notes are used in different<br/>&gt; octaves, or where octaves are not found at all, are rare.</p><p>So happy that he at least acknowledges these exist. Not<br/>sure where he gets his idea about what &apos;rare&apos; means. I<br/>would say &apos;common&apos; or &apos;ubiquitous&apos;.</p><p>&gt; By choosing a limited number of notes the ear is given a<br/>&gt; structure that is simple enough to be understandable and<br/>&gt; whose notes are spaced apart enough to be easily heard as<br/>&gt; different.</p><p>I agree this is a very important issue to consider in<br/>scale design. Not a concrete rule, depending on your<br/>purposes, but something to keep in mind.</p><p>&gt; The pitches used in purely melodic musics - such as classical<br/>&gt; Arabic and Indian are generally more flexible and complex<br/>&gt; than those used in the tonal harmonic music of common<br/>&gt; practice classical and popular music. Within any one scale we<br/>&gt; will often find more than seven notes and the distance<br/>&gt; between consecutive steps can be very small.</p><p>Right -- here is an example where his statement &quot;whose<br/>notes are spaced apart enough to be easily heard as<br/>different&quot; might find exception.</p><p>&gt; On this site I will be examining in detail only those scales<br/>&gt; which are suitable for use in tonal harmonic music.<br/>        --- --------            --------------------</p><p>YIKES!!!</p><p>(as if)</p><p>OK, that is an extremely biased statement he just made<br/>and I want to make sure you don&apos;t just gloss over it<br/>and say &apos;why sure!&apos; Also keep in mind these rules he is<br/>defining in his own abstract system and don&apos;t think<br/>he&apos;s instead outlining some sort of general musical<br/>truth.</p><p>&gt; A scale should constitute a unified collection of notes<br/>&gt; - a selection which is in some sense complete and to which<br/>&gt; any addition is heard to be extraneous.</p><p>Hm. And why is this, what does it mean and how is it<br/>defined?</p><p>&gt; The scale must also fulfil the functions demanded of it.<br/>            ----<br/>&gt; There are three principal functions that a scale may be asked<br/>&gt; to fulfil:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) to serve as a melodic resource<br/>&gt; 2) to serve as a harmonic resource<br/>&gt; 3) to be tonally effective</p><p>1 - Agreed unless scale is being used only for harmony<br/>2 - Quick disproof: nonincidental harmony did not<br/>appear on the scene until after many common scales were<br/>already in use. Yet some of these scales ended up being<br/>fine for harmony anyway.<br/>3 - huh?</p><p>&gt; It may fulfil any or all of these three functions - depending<br/>&gt; on its intended use.</p><p>Uh, OK. Intended usage is a relevant factor.</p><p>&gt; The scale as a melodic resource</p><p>&gt; For a scale to be successful as a melodic resource it should<br/>&gt; be reasonably smooth and even; without sudden gaps which<br/>&gt; sound as if a note has been omitted, or sudden concentrations<br/>&gt; of notes which sound as if an extraneous note has been added.</p><p>Well, maybe. Maybe not.</p><p>Oh well I&apos;ll stop now. The rest of the stuff could be<br/>useful depending on what you want to do, but you should<br/>realize that counterexamples can be and have been made<br/>to disprove many of these claims that involve &apos;should&apos;<br/>and &apos;must&apos;.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
