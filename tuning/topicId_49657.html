And that he might<br/>even have liked the result, who can say in<br/>absence of any evidence one way or the other.</p><p>How extensive is the extant Bach correspondence?<br/>Is it possible that he or his sons or a contemporary<br/>could have mentioned such an experiment?</p><p>Though I&apos;d say that it couldn&apos;t be regarded as the<br/>intended tuning surely if one wants to be historically<br/>accurate as then one wants to play in the tuning that<br/>would be normal for performance of the pieces for<br/>the time, so well tempered.</p><p>Similarly Beethoven might well have liked the sound<br/>of his piano pieces on a more modern piano, but to be<br/>historically accurate one might want to play them on a<br/>piano of his time.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=49666 href="#49666">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>12/12/2003 7:12:39 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 12/12/2003 8:50:03 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:robertwalker@ntlworld.com">robertwalker@ntlworld.com</a> writes:</p><p>&gt; I for one am getting won over by your arguments to<br/>&gt; the point of wondering if Bach could have<br/>&gt; experimented with 12-eq given the ease with which<br/>&gt; he could tune his keyboards.

While one might think this would include ET,<br/>I would doubt it.  All the more so because Andreas Werckmeister, himself,<br/>published that he could tune his clavier in a quarter of an hour.  This predates<br/>the Bach legend.</p><p>best, Johnny</p></div>
