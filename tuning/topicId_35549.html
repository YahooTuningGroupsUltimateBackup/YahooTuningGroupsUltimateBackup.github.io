Supposedly, one<br/>&gt; can get Sibelius to do this too, so I will report back<br/>&gt; if I can get it to happen.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Sibelius interface seems *very* intuitive, for a<br/>&gt; notation program, so maybe *these* aspects of it are why<br/>&gt; it is highly recommended by a friend who knows *both*<br/>&gt; Finale and Sibelius well...</p><p>yes, well ... there&apos;s one word here that hits the nail<br/>which is the Finale/Sibelius difference right on the head:<br/>intuitive!</p><p>intuitive is the one thing which Finale, great as it is,<br/>is *not*.</p><p>Finale&apos;s structure forces the user to navigate thru so<br/>many sub-levels of menus that the printed documentation<br/>is over 1,000 pages! (and that was for the 1997 version!).</p><p>this is the main reason why i only use Finale when i<br/>absolutely have to, to get a high-quality hard-copy score<br/>or web graphic.  otherwise i do all my computer-music<br/>work in Cakewalk, which gives rudimentary score output<br/>which i later &quot;fine-tune&quot; in Finale when necessary.</p><p>if the people at Coda were able to revamp Finale&apos;s<br/>interface so that it gives nice intuitive responses<br/>to mouse actions (currently it gives essentially none),<br/>it would be the music copyist&apos;s dream application.  i<br/>suppose that&apos;s the gap that the Sibelius people are<br/>attempting to fill.</p><p>but when all is said and done, Finale can still do<br/>just about anything.  for power users who can nail down<br/>and remember all the menu choices, it can&apos;t be beat.<br/>the tough interface is the problem, and that problem<br/>disappears with frequency of use.</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=35557 href="#35557">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2002 12:43:38 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_35549.html#35549">/tuning/topicId_35549.html#35549</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; but when all is said and done, Finale can still do<br/>&gt; just about anything.  for power users who can nail down<br/>&gt; and remember all the menu choices, it can&apos;t be beat.<br/>&gt; the tough interface is the problem, and that problem<br/>&gt; disappears with frequency of use.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Thanks, Monz, for the Finale update.  Well, certainly I know<br/>*lots* of composers who use it regularly...</p><p>However, it seems Sibelius has conquered the interface problem,<br/>although it&apos;s still not entirely a &quot;piece of cake(walk).&quot;</p><p>Also, it appears, since it&apos;s a reasonably recent program, they&apos;re<br/>willing to do additional &quot;add-ons&quot; and &quot;plug-ins.&quot;  Now whether they<br/>will work the way they are &quot;supposed&quot; to do, is another question...<br/>but maybe with enough &quot;pestering.&quot;</p><p>Who knows, maybe they would even go so far as to have<br/>entire &quot;microtonal symbols&quot; palette with HEWM??  Or an optional &quot;plug<br/>in&quot; anyway...</p><p>jp</p></div>
