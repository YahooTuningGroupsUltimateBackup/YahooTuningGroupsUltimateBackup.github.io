We live in a<br/>&gt;culture where most of us use things all the time that we do not<br/>&gt;understand why and how they work, so in one sense we cannot blame the<br/>&gt;hordes for not understanding what lies in front of them.</p><p>[YA]  Hear!  Hear!  And as any successful educator knows, people<br/>will learn only what they want to, and only when they are ready.<br/>If they don&apos;t see a need to understand musical tuning, what motive<br/>would they have?</p><p>Carl replied (to Kraig):<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a good point.  I&apos;m reminded of the fact that many drivers do<br/>&gt; not have the slightest clue how a car works.</p><p>[YA]  Exactly!  And many a good musician knows when his instrument<br/>sounds right, but doesn&apos;t understand the barest mechanical facts<br/>about how it produces those sounds.  If it&apos;s broke, he asks a mechanic<br/>to fix it.  Don&apos;t ask him &quot;What&apos;s wrong?&quot;; he&apos;s already projected an<br/>SEP field (*) over it to make it vanish.</p><p>(*) &quot;Somebody Else&apos;s Problem field&quot;, in &quot;Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the<br/>Universe&quot; by Douglas Adams.</p><p>Carl replied to Kraig:<br/>&gt; In one of the earlier episodes of Star Trek the Next Generation,<br/>&gt; they come across a seeming utopia.  Everything is run by this<br/>&gt; computer built so long ago, nobody remembers how it works.  The<br/>&gt; problem is, the utopians are becoming sterile, so they kidnap<br/>&gt; the children onboard the Enterprise.  The rest of the crew figures<br/>&gt; out that the computer emits radiation that, over the course of<br/>&gt; generations, made the utopians sterile.  They convince the utopians<br/>&gt; to shut down their computer and give back the kids.  But now the<br/>&gt; utopians must learn how to do everything for themselves again.</p><p>[YA]  Carl, that&apos;s an interesting parable.  Have you ever thought<br/>just how we&apos;d fare if modern economies and production systems<br/>broke down?  Most of us would be in dire trouble trying to feed<br/>ourselves, or get clean drinking water, after only a week.  To a<br/>greater or lesser extent, most musicians depend on others to be<br/>able to go on making music - especially if they make a living from<br/>it.</p><p>From the point of view of encouraging at least an awareness of<br/>our interdependence, if not exactly promoting a musical<br/>survivalism :-), it&apos;s good that we have a pool of specialised tuning<br/>knowledge and cognoscenti in this forum, and it&apos;s good that we<br/>endeavour to show others at least a glimpse of the hidden depths<br/>that lie beneath modern music-making.</p><p>I think that any musical education that doesn&apos;t include both the<br/>making of instruments - however simple - and their playing - must<br/>necessarily fail to instil the least &quot;appreciation&quot; for music.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p><p>--<br/>Internal Virus Database is out-of-date.<br/>Checked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>Version: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.9.15 - Release Date: 16/4/05</p></div>
