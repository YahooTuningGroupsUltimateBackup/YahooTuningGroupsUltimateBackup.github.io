In the string quartet the violins take the 1/1 as a Bb at 233.1<br/>Hz, the viola takes the 1/1 as an Eb (311.1 Hz), and the cello takes<br/>the 1/1 as a D (293.7 Hz), whereas all the other instruments are<br/>taking C at 261.6 Hz as the 1/1. So in the strictest sense this would<br/>mean that the piece really isn&apos;t in 13, however I think it is still<br/>best understood as being in 13 (perhaps a polytonal, or polymodal<br/>composite in 13?).</p><p>Dan</p></div>
