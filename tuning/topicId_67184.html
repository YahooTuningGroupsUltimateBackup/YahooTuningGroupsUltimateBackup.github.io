The kernel of a temperament is the set of all the intervals<br/>that are mapped to the unison, i.e. &quot;tempered out&quot;. The sum and<br/>difference of any two intervals in the kernel is another interval in<br/>the kernel.</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=67194 href="#67194">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2006 4:16:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow, that&apos;s a glaring omission.<br/>I could have sworn that i made a page in<br/>the Encyclopedia for &quot;kernel&quot;.</p><p>Gene, Graham ... can you guys help me with this?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tom Dent&quot; &lt;stringph@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be nice if &apos;kernel&apos; had a readily accessible<br/>&gt; definition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have looked through the Tonalsoft pages (not there)<br/>&gt; and the archives and found only this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/55587">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/55587</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; kernel - I haven&apos;t a clue.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The kernel of a temperament is all of the intervals it<br/>&gt; &gt; sends to the unison; these form another group.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Correct?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ~~~T~~~<br/>&gt;</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=67195 href="#67195">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/14/2006 5:11:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow, that&apos;s a glaring omission.<br/>&gt; I could have sworn that i made a page in<br/>&gt; the Encyclopedia for &quot;kernel&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gene, Graham ... can you guys help me with this?</p><p>I suggest you first define &quot;regular temperament&quot; and then define<br/>&quot;kernel&quot;. &quot;Regular temperament&quot; can mean either the concrete regular<br/>tuning, which is where every interval in the tuning is expressible as<br/>a product of a finte set of factors, and &quot;logical&quot; regular<br/>temperament, which is a phrase I&apos;m taking from your usage of &quot;logical<br/>meantone&quot;, and which is a more abstract object representable by a<br/>wedgie.
