Try tuning a 32/25 accurately<br/>&gt; by ear, without tuning any intermediary notes. It can&apos;t be done. However,<br/>&gt; 9/7 can be tuned pretty comfortably by ear in the higher register.</p><p>I&apos;ll buy that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for it being the &quot;natural&quot; vocal tuning for a major triad, certain list<br/>&gt; members have expressed the view (with which I agree) that 14:18:21 (or<br/>&gt; closer to the voicing Gerald discusses, 14:21:36) is a very nasty-sounding<br/>&gt; major triad.</p><p>The &quot;voicing Gerald Discusses&quot;? Just for the record, I have no mechanism<br/>(yet) by which to know which numbers fit &quot;my&quot; major triad. I&apos;m just here for<br/>the input from those of you who are hip to the numbers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would like to encourage those of you on this list you have worked with<br/>&gt; Indian music to please respond to Gerald&apos;s assertion that it is natural to<br/>&gt; sing a high third over a root-fifth drone, regardless of cultural<br/>&gt; environment.</p><p>I&apos;m all &quot;ears.&quot;</p><p>Is that India &quot;Indian&quot; music? If so (or even if not so), do you know of the<br/>CD by Sheila Chandra called &quot;Moonsung: A Real World Retrospective&quot;? This<br/>lady is one of a kind. She is to vocal sound what Wolfgang Puck is to food.<br/>She says:</p><p> &quot;A drone will at once both support and form a contrast or harmony with the<br/>note of the lead vocal over it. Following this changing relationship, or<br/>counterpoint of intervals between these two notes, is often where the<br/>interest lies. At the same time, whilst it will offer an instant atmosphere,<br/>the drone will not colour the melody in emotional terms, as chords do. It<br/>throws the responsibility back on the singer to create enough interest and<br/>emotion to engage the listener. The drone empowers the singer even though<br/>its harmonics contain seeds of melody.&quot;</p><p>Aside from her philosophy, her major thirds in band one alternate between<br/>what appear to be both the JI third and the &quot;high third.&quot; Her opening phrase<br/>follows this scale-step contour: 3-3-3-5-4-3, 1-3-1-b7.  Her initial pitches<br/>appear to be the JI major third (below 12-tET); however, when she arrives at<br/>the third following scale step 4, her third is clearly tuned well above<br/>12-tET. Her b7 is deliciously low, and approximates the &quot;blue seventh&quot;<br/>commonly heard in rhythm-and-blues vocals.</p><p>But I digress. I anxiously await the input requested by Paul. Perhaps I&apos;ll<br/>have to find a term to replace &quot;natural.&quot; I&apos;m certainly willing. But until<br/>shown differently, I&apos;ll continue to use the term. (God, this is fun.)</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3>Paul H.

All I meant was that you were discussing a voicing with<br/>the third in the soprano. I simply took the triad with 9:7 major third and<br/>transposed the third so that the chord would be in, or &quot;closer to&quot; &quot;your<br/>voicing&quot;. OK?</p></div><h3>Paul H.
