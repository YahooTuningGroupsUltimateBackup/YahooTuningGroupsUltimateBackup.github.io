But looking at primarily that aspect of<br/>it doesn&apos;t mean they are much alike, just that they were both very<br/>individual. There could easily be parallels with other<br/>art/disciplines, but if they are both composers and a view is<br/>propigated that they were so much alike it is very misleading.

The major works at U of I were underwritten<br/>by commissions and student body groups (IIRC), and his one brief stab<br/>at &quot;teaching&quot; came at UCSD, and was one of the most distasteful<br/>scenarios of his life. Pretty well chronicled in his own letters and<br/>notes in Blackburn&apos;s &quot;Enclosure 3&quot;. If you want first-hand knowledge<br/>of what it was like to have sat in one of his classes, just ask John<br/>Chalmers, who was there (and is quoted in E3 about the experience).</p><p>He just wasn&apos;t cut out to be a teacher, if for no other reason that<br/>he didn&apos;t want the typical teacher/disciple relationship. Ben<br/>Johnston can not only attest to this, but points to it in &apos;defence&apos;<br/>of his oblique manner of handling Partch matters, then and continuing<br/>into the here and now...</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m sure you have an answer to this, Jon...</p><p>Just one aspect of it, that&apos;s all.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=32423 href="#32423">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/7/2002 9:23:35 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: jpehrson2 &lt;<a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, January 07, 2002 7:31 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Schoenberg and Partch, antimatter twins?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;jonszanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_32374.html#32406">/tuning/topicId_32374.html#32406</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Joe,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I first noticed a strong connection between Partch and Schoenberg<br/>&gt; &lt;snip.&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, basically what struck me was the fact that *both* composers had<br/>&gt; uncompromising views of music that were, at the time of composition,<br/>&gt; far from the mainstream.</p><p>Yes, Joe, what you write here is true.</p><p>But what&apos;s so interesting to me is that the similarities go far<br/>deeper than that.  At least based on *my* understanding of their<br/>theoretical work, Schoenberg and Partch actally shared very similar<br/>conceptions of two important musical pheomena: that pitch-space<br/>and sonance are both continua which are inifitely divisible,<br/>and how they may be divided, and how those divisions may be<br/>related to each other.</p><p>&gt; There are, of course, differences as well.  I can&apos;t imagine Partch<br/>&gt; getting up in front of a class in a suit and tie with a piece of<br/>&gt; chalk in his hand going over the &quot;harmonic regions&quot; or such like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, Schoenberg was certainly more of a &quot;pedagogue&quot; in that sense.</p><p>Right again, Joe.  Schoenberg earned his living for most of his<br/>life as a teacher of theory and composition.</p><p>But again, there&apos;s a huge *musical* difference that separates them,<br/>and it&apos;ll be obvious to everyone here: Partch chose to take the<br/>more difficult path of building his own ensemble of instruments<br/>to achieve the sounds he heard in his head, while Schoenberg chose<br/>to utilize the existing 12-EDO scale as his vehicle, but to use<br/>it in *new ways* which *implied* the higher-prime rational harmonies.</p><p>&gt; However, after I was thinking about this for a while, it occured to<br/>&gt; me that Partch also &quot;taught.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What, exactly, did he do on such assignments at the University of<br/>&gt; Illinois and such like?  Did he just compose his music and teach<br/>&gt; performers about his work, or did he have to do some kind of &quot;formal&quot;<br/>&gt; theory classes as well?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My guess is that he probably didn&apos;t do such classes, but I don&apos;t know<br/>&gt; for sure.</p><p>Hmm ... Partch did occassionally have assignments where he taught<br/>in class.  The last one was here in San Diego, at UCSD, in 1967.<br/>I&apos;m sure Jon is the one to fill you in on details about this and<br/>Partch&apos;s other teaching gigs, but I&apos;ve heard some very interesting<br/>(and very funny) stories about this from Jonathan Glasier and<br/>John Chalmers, who attended.
