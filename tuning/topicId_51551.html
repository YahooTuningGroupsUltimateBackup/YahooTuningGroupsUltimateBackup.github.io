This is music<br/>performed with an ensemble of huge bamboo flutes, not the metallophones<br/>typically associated with Balinese music. I was curious about the tuning,<br/>so I started tuning the strings of my &quot;melody harp&quot; (one of those toy<br/>zither sort of things with 15 metal strings on a wooden frame), and<br/>eventually realized that the flutes were playing modes of a 9-note scale,<br/>not the usual 7-note pelog! After trying to match the tuning for a while, I<br/>realized that it&apos;s an unequal 9-note scale; certain notes were played<br/>consistently sharper or flatter than 9-ET. And although the pitch varied<br/>from one register of the flutes to another, it seemed to be fairly<br/>consistent with a scale having a pattern of small and large steps,<br/>sLsLLsLsL. This is the same pattern as the scale of &quot;beep-9&quot;, and is<br/>consistent with von Hornbostel&apos;s &quot;primitive pelog type b&quot; scale from the<br/>Scala archive. (His &quot;type a&quot; scale is based on a flattened fifth --<br/>essentially what we&apos;re calling &quot;pelogic&quot; temperament.)</p><p>Now, it doesn&apos;t seem clear how the tempering of 27/25 can have anything to<br/>do with the pelog scale. This is just an example of a particular kind of<br/>&quot;distributionally even&quot; scale that has some interesting properties,<br/>independent from its relationship to the harmonic lattice. So I&apos;m going<br/>back to my original opinion that the 27/25 comma is probably of not much<br/>interest in itself, even though I uncovered some interesting stuff in the<br/>process of investigating it.</p><p>In any case, this might suggest some appropriate uses for the modes of what<br/>I should probably start calling &quot;von Hornbostel&apos;s pelog temperament&quot;, to<br/>distinguish it from &quot;beep&quot; (which implies tempering out 27;25), even though<br/>the structure of the scale is the same. The first three tracks on the CD<br/>are in the selisir mode, and use mainly pitches 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8 of the<br/>9-note scale (arbitrarily starting the numbering on a pitch near &quot;C&quot;). The<br/>fourth track, in the sunaren mode, uses mainly 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the<br/>next three tracks, in the baro mode, use 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6, and the final<br/>track, in the lebeng mode, uses 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.</p><p>So using the naming convention of naming the notes by the number of<br/>generators it takes to produce them, here are the modes:</p><p>vHpelog-9        2 7 3 8 4 0 5 1 6<br/>vHpelog-7        2 7 3 4 0 5 1<br/>tetekep selisir  2 3 4 0 6<br/>tetekep sunaren  2 7 8 4 0 5<br/>tetekep baro     2 7 3 0 5<br/>tetekep lebeng   7 3 8 5 1</p><p>Note that the meaning of mode names like &quot;selisir&quot; and &quot;sunaren&quot; varies<br/>from one ensemble to another, so these may not be the best names to give<br/>these modes. Also, it&apos;s not clear which note is considered the first note<br/>of the scale in any of these modes, but the mode called &quot;baro&quot; here sounds<br/>pretty much like the typical 5-note pelog, starting on the note &quot;2&quot;. It<br/>seems likely that the sunaren mode starts on &quot;4&quot;, and lebeng on &quot;7&quot;. I&apos;m<br/>not sure about the &quot;selisir&quot; mode, but the CD booklet shows it as starting<br/>one step lower than &quot;baro&quot;, so it makes sense for it to start on the note<br/>&quot;6&quot;. The CD booklet also lists a &quot;tetekep tembung&quot;, but since it&apos;s given in<br/>terms of the 7-note scale, it&apos;s not clear which notes of the 9-note scale<br/>would be used for it.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@bigpond.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>1/11/2004 2:17:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@I...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Now, it doesn&apos;t seem clear how the tempering of 27/25 can have<br/>anything to<br/>&gt; do with the pelog scale.

Every other note of vHpelog-14 is a note of pelogic-7,<br/>so you can get two interlocking pelogic scales by playing whole-tone scales<br/>if you&apos;ve got your keyboard tuned that way!

This suggests that the best tuning<br/>for this scale might be half the top pelogic generator (260.76 cents),<br/>instead of the top beep generator, with a period of 1206.55 cents (which<br/>should result in a more authentic sound for the unequal pelog modes).
