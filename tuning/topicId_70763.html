For the top two parts I started with the imitation gangsa sound, changing the envelopes and filtering to get more of a wooden sound like a marimba. The bass part has more of a metallic sound, with a tremolo effect added to simulate detuning. I added a fourth part which mainly doubles notes from the other three parts, which is played by the reyong.</p><p>Compare the original version:</p><p><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/yulegu-twilight.mp3">http://home.comcast.net/~teamouse/yulegu-twilight.mp3</a></p></div><h3><a id=70767 href="#70767">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2007 5:44:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="http://teamouse.googlepages.com/yulegu-twilight.mp3">http://teamouse.googlepages.com/yulegu-twilight.mp3</a></p><p>This is an updated version of &quot;Yulegu Island at Twilight&quot;, using sounds based on the gangsa and reyong instruments, but adapted to the tuning.
