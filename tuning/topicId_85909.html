So I&apos;m<br/>&gt; surprised you have an interest in it, but also happy because<br/>&gt; maybe I will learn more about it (since unlike its other<br/>&gt; proponents, you speak the microtonal language too).</p><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>Yes, I am Hudson Lacerda. Glad you liked (and recalled!) Neo-old(19).</p><p>That piece is tonal, thus it does not require a set theory reference.</p><p>However I use pitch set theory when (pre-)composing atonal music -- never mind: pitch class set theory is an approach to analyse &quot;post-tonal music&quot;, where the traditional harmony description hardly would help; it is not a generalized music theory. Thus, if you try apply it to tonal or modal music, I will probably end up with empty hands, because other analytical approaches are much more suitable for that kind of music. (Well, you can find that there are lots of sets with Forte name &quot;3-11&quot;... :-))</p><p>When I was composing Neo-old(19) I also analysed a few sets of 19-EDO using set theory. An interesting finding was that the approximation of harmonics 1:3:5:7:9:11:13 is symmetrical and identical to a transposition of a subharmonics set (1:/3:/5:/7:/9:/11:/13). That property allowed me to build a symmetrical 19-tone row around the pitch class 0:</p><p>Harmonics/subharmonics:<br/>   15 13 11  9  7 5  3  1 | 1  3 5  7 9 11 13 15<br/>    3  7  1  5 13 9 15 11 | 11 15 9 13 5  1  7  3<br/>Pitch classes (= for natural, _ for flat, ^ for sharp) as pitch names, with C as central axis:<br/>   _D =E _G _B ^D _A =F =C | =C =G =E __B =D ^F _A =B<br/>Pitch classes in numerical form starting from 0:<br/>   0 11 6 15 3 9 13 17 1 4 7 10 14 18 5 12 2 16 8</p><p>However, I have not used this series for composition so far.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My question may look rather vague: let us suppose that I like<br/>&gt; &gt; the chord {B,C,F,Bb} and want to find scales in which the<br/>&gt; &gt; chord has interesting features that could be explored in a<br/>&gt; &gt; composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Depending what features you find interesting, regular mapping<br/>&gt; can certainly help.  We usually start with just intonation,<br/>&gt; since JI chords have historically been musical targets and are<br/>&gt; identifiable by naive listeners in experiments.  But one could<br/>&gt; start with any chord.  The chord is broken down into its<br/>&gt; generators, which in this case could be 100cents and 500cents.<br/>&gt; The picture looks like this (please view message with a fixed<br/>&gt; width font)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; B<br/>&gt; |<br/>&gt; C---F---Bb<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; | = 100cents   --- = 500cents<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then, following Fokker, we find scales that contain many of<br/>&gt; these chords.  The basic goal is to maximize their number for<br/>&gt; a given scale size (cardinality).</p><p>Indeed. An additional question is: which cardinality is the most efficient in that aspect (embedding instances of a given subset)?</p><p>This question may be relevant in closed systems like 12-ET, since the differences between subsets (e.g. scales) are blurred as the cardinality approaches 12. There may be an optimal cardinality, possibly around 5..7.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Or the reverse: suppose I got a scale/tuning at random (from<br/>&gt; &gt; Scala archive, for example) and found an interesting sonority,<br/>&gt; &gt; that I recognize as (or could represent as) the set<br/>&gt; &gt; {B,C,F,Bb} -- then I want to know if this set has a &quot;family&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; in that scale/tuning: transpositions and other related sets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I said &quot;maximize their number&quot; I mean by transposition.<br/>&gt; &quot;Other related sets&quot; is where we may disagree.  If we&apos;re doing<br/>&gt; music theory, I think we should consider only relations that<br/>&gt; are audible.  If two sets share a relation they should sound<br/>&gt; more similar than two sets not sharing the relation.  This is<br/>&gt; well established for transposition.</p><p>Yes, the &quot;canonical&quot; similarity/equivalence relation is transposition. But other relations, even those that may arise controversy, can be useful for composition, or may be useful for analysis. For example, the &quot;inversion equivalence&quot; (which maps a minor triad to a major triad) proposed by Allen Forte is questioned by Larry Solomon. Both have good arguments: inversion was extensively used by composers of atonal music as a rather basic derivation; for the other hand, inversion-related sets can sound different enough to deserve different classification in many contexts.</p><p>Can you find that {C,E,G} and {C,Eb,G} share something in common, specially when compared to other 3-element subsets of 12-EDO? Yet: Given the sets A={C,Eb,G,Bb}, B={D,Eb,G#,A}, C={C,E,G,B} and D={B,C,F,Bb}, can you group or sort them according to &quot;similarity&quot;?</p><p>Then, I assume that there are different degrees of similarity, starting with transpositions and dispositions of a pitch set (not reduced), then reducing pitch classes in octave equivalence, reducing sets to a normal form, etc.</p><p>I also use to evaluate pc set operations as of relative or context-dependent usefulness. For instance, chords with six or more elements are difficult to analyse and compare by ear, and the disposition of the pitches is quite important (compare the chords {C,D,E,F,G,A,B}, {F,C,G,D,A,E,B} and {D,F,A,C,E,G,B}, which are the &quot;same&quot; pitch class set). But if six pitches are presented as a melodic sequence, their repetition (even transposed) may be perceived as equivalent. Such issues are, for me, an incentive to seek more similarity criteria (possibly without reduce the pitches/intervals in classes), since octave equivalence, transposition and inversion show their limits.</p><p>It is a matter of sense selecting the sets which may be relevant in a musical excerpt. Therefore, I am not willing to discard such or such pitch relations a priori.</p><p>I am composing a serial piece for 17-EDO guitar, and I will use something I thought I would never use, because the result is &quot;too dissimilar&quot; to the origin: transformation by multiplication (just multiply the pitch class number by a constant factor). The interval contents of the series is radically changed: the only common point is the special symmetrical organization of the original series. The original series has a lot of &quot;minor seconds&quot; (interval class 1), which are mapped to &quot;fourths&quot; (ic 7). The goal is to change the harmonic color of the piece in certain sections -- I could use an entirely new material, but using a derivation I can maintain some invariant (structural) properties. That may be an example of a rather arbitrary derivation being useful in composition. Formally, the multiplicated serieses might be considered &quot;equivalent&quot;, but the are musically useful exactly for the opposite quality: sound different.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For instance, in 12-ET, the interval vector of {B,C,F,Bb}<br/>&gt; &gt; (or {11,0,5,10}) is &lt;210021&gt;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you explain how is this interval vector is calculated<br/>&gt; from {11,0,5,10}?</p><p>It is an accounting of the occurrences of each interval class. In mod12 we have 6 interval classes, from 1 (semitone, M7, m9...) to 6 (tritone). As a consequence of octave equivalence, complementar (unordered) intervals are equivalent (P4th == P5th). Each entry of that &quot;vector&quot; is the number of instances of the corresponding interval class in the set:</p><p>A 4-element set has 6 2-element subsets. In this example the dyads are classified and accounted as &lt;210021&gt;:</p><p>2: {Bb,B} and {B,C} for interval class 1;<br/>1: {Bb,C}           for ic 2;<br/>0: (none ic 3 (m3));<br/>0: (none ic 4 (M3));<br/>2: {C,F} and {F,Bb} for ic 5;<br/>1: {F,B} for ic 6;</p><p>Or, using numbers:</p><p>----------.--------------.-------------.<br/>          | Interval     | Class       |<br/>11 0 5 10 | (mod12,mod7) | 1 2 3 4 5 6 |<br/>----------+--------------+-------------|<br/>11 0      | 11-0=11=1    | x           |<br/>11   5    | 11-5=6       |           x |<br/>11     10 | 11-10=1      | x           |<br/>   0 5    | 0-5=-5=7=5   |         x   |<br/>   0   10 | 0-10=-10=2   |   x         |<br/>     5 10 | 5-10=-5=7=5  |         x   |<br/>----------+--------------+-------------|<br/>Interval vector:         | 2 1 0 0 2 1 |<br/>-------------------------&apos;-------------&apos;</p><p>An interesting extension of the interval vector concept may be a &quot;trichord vector&quot;, which analyses the 3-element subsets. In mod12 there are 12 trichord classes according to Forte&apos;s classification -- thus, the &quot;trichord vector&quot; would have 12 entries.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Some deductions are: transposition at interval classes 1<br/>&gt; &gt;(semitone) or 5 (fourth) result in 2 common pitch classes;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we generate scales that contain many instances of the<br/>&gt; chord per scale tone, the chord instances must have many<br/>&gt; common tones between them...</p><p>Yes, &quot;many&quot;. How many exactly? Given a scale generated that way are there interesting &quot;byproducts&quot; (subsets, chords, embeded scales)? Which are these &quot;byproducts&quot;? How about other chords of the same scale, which could be used as constrastant material? Are there other generator chords which lead to the same scale?</p><p>But there are other interesting sets: sets which show some saturation for the non-redundance feature. For instance:</p><p>(0,1,4,6), a.k.a. 4-Z15, e.g. {C,Db,E,F#}, {C,D,F,F#}<br/>(0,1,3,7), a.k.a. 4-Z29, e.g. (C,Db,Eb,G}, {C,E,F#,G}</p><p>Their interval vector is &lt;111111&gt;: each interval class occur exactly once, and all them are present. They condense the interval resources of 12-EDO, in some way.</p><p>The interesting point here is the equal distribution of interval classes, rather than containing the maximum number of a given subset (to say, an interval) in that cardinality. There are no equivalent subsets: all 3-element subsets are different.</p><p>How to find (in a given universe) sets with minimum redundance of interval/subset classes?</p><p>In mod13 there are also tetrachords with interval vector &lt;111111&gt;; they could be used in Bohlen-Pierce scale, or in 13-EDO. In mod17, there are not such interval vectors, but there are ones like &lt;10111101&gt; or &lt;1111100&gt;, where two interval classes are absent. In mod10 and mod11, we have pentachords with vector &lt;22222&gt;. Interesting symmetry properties may be found in mod16, since 16 is 2*2*2*2 -- or perhaps it is the opposite: the symmetry may be excessive and boring (like the dim7-chord in 12-ET), an then the interesting sets might be the assymetrical ones -- how diverse are the subsets in mod16? How to effectively explore such properties in those uncommon scales?</p><p>These questions may show points of contact or complementarity between different theoretical approaches.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The set can be completely invariant under &quot;inversion&quot;:<br/>&gt; &gt;{B,Bb,F,C} (an useful information for counterpoint and serial<br/>&gt; &gt;music).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is apparently &quot;inversion&quot; as in normal music theory,<br/>&gt; which is really circular permutation.  But we were talking<br/>&gt; about sets, which are unordered, so I&apos;m confused.  They<br/>&gt; also contained pitch classes, so it&apos;s impossible to change<br/>&gt; their order in a chord (unless we say B&apos; or B&apos;&apos; etc).  Are<br/>&gt; we playing them as a melody in a different order?</p><p>No, I am talking about &quot;inversion&quot; as &quot;mirror&quot;, inverting the direction of the intervals:</p><p>B C F Bb =&gt; +1 +5 +5<br/>B Bb F C =&gt; -1 -5 -5</p><p>In this case, as you noticed, the result is equivalent to a simple permutation, and that is an interesting feature for counterpoint.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Take the index on the chain of fifths<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; {B,C,F,Bb} -&gt; {5,0,-1,-2}<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It would be {11,0,5,10} in a chain of semitones...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Multiply each term by 7, for the number of nominals<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; available<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; {35,0,-7,-14}<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Add 4 because there are 4 pitch classes in play<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; {39,4,-3,-10}<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I could not follow that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I must confess this was a rhetorical example; a meaningless<br/>&gt; transformation that produces a transposition of a M3.<br/>&gt; I was trying to poke fun at music set theory.</p><p>It was ironic that the set resisted firmly to your manipulations. :-)</p><p>It is completely invariant under multiplication by 7 (which is that &quot;other&quot; generator besides the semitone):</p><p>octave:1&gt; S=[11,0,5,10]<br/>S =</p><p>  11   0   5  10</p><p>octave:2&gt; mod(S*7,12)<br/>ans =</p><p>   5   0  11  10</p><p>Furthermore, simple adding does just a transposition:<br/>4 semitones = Major 3rd.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It lets us find optimal tunings for any scale.  It lets us<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; find the scales, out of all possible scales, that are the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; natural competitors of the diatonic scale.  It shows us how<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; these scales are related, and how they can be transformed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; into one another, or how music written in one can be cast<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; into another.  It tells us when such recasting is likely to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; result in a qualitative change in the music vs. a more subtle<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sense that the same piece has simply been retuned.  etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Could the set {B,C,F,Bb} be considered a &quot;scale&quot; in that<br/>&gt; &gt; sense? How it could be related to other scales, or maybe used<br/>&gt; &gt; to generate other scales?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The kind of scales I was referring to here must have a mapping<br/>&gt; to the generators of the desired chord(s).  So {B,C,F,Bb} can<br/>&gt; be the desired chord or the scale.  If it&apos;s both, the<br/>&gt; temperament mapping is trivial and not very interesting.</p><p>I mean: a scale when comparing it to other scales.</p><p>A mapping is a group theory operation. I am wondering if pitch class set theory and regular mappings could be used in a complementary way, each one providing useful insights and tools for each other.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It doesn&apos;t tell us what notes to write once a scales and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tunings have been selected.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If it can find scales &quot;that are the natural competitors of<br/>&gt; &gt; the diatonic scale&quot;, then I suppose it takes in account<br/>&gt; &gt; certain properties of subsets of those scales (for example:<br/>&gt; &gt; the number of subsets approximating 4:5:6 or other ratios).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly.</p><p>Then there may be space for an integrated approach, if some concepts can be harmonized.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=85988 href="#85988">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Lucy &#x3C;lucy@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/3/2010 4:30:18 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I hadn&apos;t worried to sue David Doty for libel, when he cast doubts on my engineering qualifications, in his biased review of LucyTuning back in the eighties, nor Carl for his rantings.</p><p>Although this time it may well be worth it.

Neo-old(19).</p><p>I have the midi and pdf score carefully archived, along with<br/>your 17-EDO piece.  Neo-old is one of my favorite microtonal<br/>compositions.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The chord is broken down into its<br/>&gt; &gt; generators, which in this case could be 100cents and 500cents.<br/>&gt; &gt; The picture looks like this (please view message with a fixed<br/>&gt; &gt; width font)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; B<br/>&gt; &gt; |<br/>&gt; &gt; C---F---Bb<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; | = 100cents   --- = 500cents<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Then, following Fokker, we find scales that contain many of<br/>&gt; &gt; these chords.  The basic goal is to maximize their number for<br/>&gt; &gt; a given scale size (cardinality).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed. An additional question is: which cardinality is the<br/>&gt; most efficient in that aspect (embedding instances of a given<br/>&gt; subset)?</p><p>We have several precise notions of this efficiency.  The most<br/>prominent is called &quot;logflat badness&quot;.  For a given logflat<br/>badness cutoff there is an infinite series of increasingly-<br/>accurate temperaments, with the same number of temperaments<br/>in each logarithmic bin of scale size (10-100, 100-1000 etc).</p><p>&gt; Yes, the &quot;canonical&quot; similarity/equivalence relation is<br/>&gt; transposition. But other relations, even those that may arise<br/>&gt; controversy, can be useful for composition, or may be useful<br/>&gt; for analysis. For example, the &quot;inversion equivalence&quot; (which<br/>&gt; maps a minor triad to a major triad) proposed by Allen Forte<br/>&gt; is questioned by Larry Solomon. Both have good arguments:<br/>&gt; inversion was extensively used by composers of atonal music as<br/>&gt; a rather basic derivation; for the other hand, inversion-<br/>&gt; related sets can sound different enough to deserve different<br/>&gt; classification in many contexts.</p><p>Of course it would be useful to analyze music generated with<br/>it -- any relation has this property!  But inversion is not<br/>audible to ordinary human beings.  If we&apos;re talking about<br/>harmony, try comparing 4:5:6:7:9:11:13 to its subharmonic<br/>inverse.  If we&apos;re talking about melody we can be a little<br/>more permissive, but the similarity is not strong enough to<br/>be generally useful in analyzing music.</p><p>&gt; Can you find that {C,E,G} and {C,Eb,G} share something in common,<br/>&gt; specially when compared to other 3-element subsets of 12-EDO?</p><p>Yes, they share 2 of 3 pitches!  I think C-E-G and F-Ab-C<br/>are proper inverses.  They sound less similar but are still<br/>related because they share a strong outer interval (3:2).<br/>Inverses on average (out of all possible structures to start<br/>with) have approximately zero audible similarity.</p><p>&gt; I also use to evaluate pc set operations as of relative or<br/>&gt; context-dependent usefulness. For instance, chords with six or<br/>&gt; more elements are difficult to analyse and compare by ear, and<br/>&gt; the disposition of the pitches is quite important (compare the<br/>&gt; chords {C,D,E,F,G,A,B}, {F,C,G,D,A,E,B} and {D,F,A,C,E,G,B},<br/>&gt; which are the &quot;same&quot; pitch class set). But if six pitches are<br/>&gt; presented as a melodic sequence, their repetition (even<br/>&gt; transposed) may be perceived as equivalent. Such issues are,<br/>&gt; for me, an incentive to seek more similarity criteria (possibly<br/>&gt; without reduce the pitches/intervals in classes), since octave<br/>&gt; equivalence, transposition and inversion show their limits.</p><p>I think rhythm is more important in melodic similarity than<br/>pitch.  There are very few pitch transformations that will<br/>produce any similarity by themselves.  In fact, only three are<br/>recognized by common-practice music theory:</p><p>1. transposition of entire structures by any interval and<br/>2. transposition of individual pitches by octaves (&quot;voicing&quot;)<br/>3. modal transposition (e.g. Ionian to Aeolian).</p><p>Regular mapping generally only considers #1 since it is by<br/>far the strongest.  Octave-equivalent voicings stop sounding<br/>so similar above the 5-limit.  Rothenberg stability (the same<br/>as Balzano coherence IIRC) gives us the likelihood that a<br/>melody will be recognizable in another mode.  It is the only<br/>scale property not based on psychoacoustic consonance that&apos;s<br/>popular among regular mapping theorists.</p><p>Serialists often cite things like the arcane rules of the<br/>Ars Nova, the use of retrograde and other transformations in<br/>canons by people like Bach, and the tradition of change<br/>ringing in England, as historical precedents for their craft.</p><p>I&apos;m not familiar enough with Ars Nova practices to comment,<br/>but to the extent such rules were followed I submit they were<br/>just as &apos;academic&apos; as 20th century serialism, and in both<br/>cases made no contribution to the great music composed.</p><p>As far as Bach, I recently wrote this on tuning-math:<br/>&quot;Bach used things like retrograde not because it was an audible<br/>transformation, but because it&apos;s challenging to do it and still<br/>harmonize the canon.  He tells you he did it (in the canonic<br/>riddle) so you&apos;re sure to be impressed.  If he were to throw<br/>the retrograde on top of the theme without bothering to<br/>harmonize it, that wouldn&apos;t have been impressive at all.  With<br/>Bach, the transformation was an arbitrary way to make the canon<br/>harder.  With serialists, the transformation is said to be a<br/>meaningful way to make harmony obsolete.  That&apos;s wrong.  It&apos;s<br/>not a matter of taste.  If you can&apos;t hear the transformation<br/>it&apos;s not meaningful, period.&quot;</p><p>As for change ringing, the bells were generally limited in<br/>number and had limited harmonicity.  They therefore provided<br/>little ability to evoke stable pitches, and in any case too<br/>few pitches to make detailed melodies.  The natural type of<br/>music to create with such a resource is an ambient wash of<br/>partials that takes as long as possible to repeat.  One could<br/>write such music for orchestra as a novelty, but it would get<br/>boring quickly since it doesn&apos;t fully use the orchestra&apos;s<br/>resources (whereas it does fully use the belfry&apos;s resources).</p><p>&gt; I am composing a serial piece for 17-EDO guitar, and I will<br/>&gt; use something I thought I would never use, because the result<br/>&gt; is &quot;too dissimilar&quot; to the origin: transformation by<br/>&gt; multiplication (just multiply the pitch class number by a<br/>&gt; constant factor).</p><p>In discussions with serialists on this list in the past, it<br/>has usually come down to, &quot;But I find these techniques inspire<br/>my compositions!&quot;  And of course, that&apos;s great!  Anything<br/>that inspires music needs no further justification.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; For instance, in 12-ET, the interval vector of {B,C,F,Bb}<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (or {11,0,5,10}) is &lt;210021&gt;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you explain how is this interval vector is calculated<br/>&gt; &gt; from {11,0,5,10}?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is an accounting of the occurrences of each interval class.<br/>&gt; In mod12 we have 6 interval classes, from 1 (semitone, M7, m9...)<br/>&gt; to 6 (tritone). As a consequence of octave equivalence,<br/>&gt; complementar (unordered) intervals are equivalent (P4th == P5th).<br/>&gt; Each entry of that &quot;vector&quot; is the number of instances of the<br/>&gt; corresponding interval class in the set:</p><p>I see.  Thanks.  As you might guess, I consider such a<br/>representation highly dubious as far as human perception is<br/>concerned.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If we generate scales that contain many instances of the<br/>&gt; &gt; chord per scale tone, the chord instances must have many<br/>&gt; &gt; common tones between them...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, &quot;many&quot;. How many exactly?</p><p>Well, we can count them if we need to know.  But generally<br/>if you have the best temperament according to logflat<br/>badness you&apos;ll get as many or more than in any other scale<br/>of equivalent size.</p><p>&gt;Given a scale generated that way are there interesting<br/>&gt;&quot;byproducts&quot; (subsets, chords, embeded scales)? Which are<br/>&gt;these &quot;byproducts&quot;? How about other chords of the same scale,<br/>&gt;which could be used as constrastant material? Are there other<br/>&gt;generator chords which lead to the same scale?</p><p>Generally we just optimize the number of 100- and 500-cent<br/>dyads.  Then we&apos;re also optimizing the number of consonant<br/>structures based on them, whatever they are.  The key is<br/>to find the generators (100cents and 500cents in this case)<br/>that most quickly produce the structure(s) we care about.<br/>In the case of just intonation, these are just the prime<br/>numbers (we induce a weighting on the primes to make the<br/>composite numbers come out right according to psychoacoustic<br/>consonance).</p><p>&gt; In mod13 there are also tetrachords with interval vector<br/>&gt; &lt;111111&gt;; they could be used in Bohlen-Pierce scale, or in<br/>&gt; 13-EDO. In mod17, there are not such interval vectors, but<br/>&gt; there are ones like &lt;10111101&gt; or &lt;1111100&gt;, where two interval<br/>&gt; classes are absent. In mod10 and mod11, we have pentachords<br/>&gt; with vector &lt;22222&gt;. Interesting symmetry properties may be<br/>&gt; found in mod16, since 16 is 2*2*2*2 -- or perhaps it is the<br/>&gt; opposite: the symmetry may be excessive and boring (like the<br/>&gt; dim7-chord in 12-ET), an then the interesting sets might be<br/>&gt; the assymetrical ones -- how diverse are the subsets in mod16?<br/>&gt; How to effectively explore such properties in those<br/>&gt; uncommon scales?</p><p>It seems to me that most of the techniques are adaptable to<br/>microtonal scales.  You should definitely get in touch with<br/>Paul Hjelmistad, as he&apos;s done work in this area.</p><p>&gt; No, I am talking about &quot;inversion&quot; as &quot;mirror&quot;, inverting<br/>&gt; the direction of the intervals:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; B C F Bb =&gt; +1 +5 +5<br/>&gt; B Bb F C =&gt; -1 -5 -5<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In this case, as you noticed, the result is equivalent to a<br/>&gt; simple permutation, and that is an interesting feature for<br/>&gt; counterpoint.</p><p>Ah, OK.</p><p>&gt; It is completely invariant under multiplication by 7 (which is<br/>&gt; that &quot;other&quot; generator besides the semitone):<br/>[snip]<br/>&gt; Furthermore, simple adding does just a transposition:<br/>&gt; 4 semitones = Major 3rd.</p><p>Indeed.  But there is a point to be made here regarding some<br/>music set theory papers I&apos;ve seen that claim to derive the<br/>diatonic scale from first principles.  As I mentioned, this<br/>was my third attempt at mutilating your set with simple<br/>operations based on famous numbers like 7, but none of them<br/>mutilated too much.  That&apos;s because 12 is a small, highly-<br/>composite number.  It&apos;s easy to do things in 12 that produce<br/>meaningful scales because almost all scales in 12 are<br/>meaningful, because 12 happens to be an insanely great<br/>temperament in terms of logflat badness.  This is my gripe --<br/>it&apos;s regular mapping that has truly derived the diatonic<br/>scale (and 12-ET) from first principles, since it could go<br/>wrong with things like 11-ET and so on.  If we assume 12 we<br/>cannot go too wrong.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It lets us find optimal tunings for any scale.  It lets us<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find the scales, out of all possible scales, that are the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; natural competitors of the diatonic scale.  It shows us how<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these scales are related, and how they can be transformed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into one another, or how music written in one can be cast<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into another.  It tells us when such recasting is likely to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; result in a qualitative change in the music vs. a more subtle<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sense that the same piece has simply been retuned.  etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Could the set {B,C,F,Bb} be considered a &quot;scale&quot; in that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sense? How it could be related to other scales, or maybe used<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to generate other scales?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The kind of scales I was referring to here must have a mapping<br/>&gt; &gt; to the generators of the desired chord(s).  So {B,C,F,Bb} can<br/>&gt; &gt; be the desired chord or the scale.  If it&apos;s both, the<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament mapping is trivial and not very interesting.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I mean: a scale when comparing it to other scales.</p><p>Hm.  In regular mapping, we compare scales against a target.<br/>Is {B,C,F,Bb} a scale or the target?  If 4:3 were the<br/>target {B,C,F,Bb} is doing OK because it contains two 4:3<br/>intervals in four notes.  But it would be inferior to<br/>{G,C,F,Bb} which contains three 4:3 intervals.</p><p>&gt; A mapping is a group theory operation. I am wondering if pitch<br/>&gt; class set theory and regular mappings could be used in a<br/>&gt; complementary way, each one providing useful insights and tools<br/>&gt; for each other.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure.  It bears further thought.  We are used to<br/>fighting music set theory bitterly.

So what question do you have about them, that you want<br/>&gt; &gt; theory to answer?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Each theory has its own range of specific questions and answers. I could not yet see any relation between set theory and regular mappings, so that they can be comparable models.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My question may look rather vague: let us suppose that I like the chord {B,C,F,Bb} and want to find scales in which the chord has interesting features that could be explored in a composition. Or the reverse: suppose I got a scale/tuning at random (from Scala archive, for example) and found an interesting sonority, that I recognize as (or could represent as) the set {B,C,F,Bb} -- then I want to know if this set has a &quot;family&quot; in that scale/tuning: transpositions and other related sets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As you see, this is the opposite of generating a scale and/or tuning: it is a matter of analysing a scale/tuning and its subsets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For instance, in 12-ET, the interval vector of {B,C,F,Bb} (or {11,0,5,10}) is &lt;210021&gt;. Some deductions are: transposition at interval classes 1 (semitone) or 5 (fourth) result in 2 common pitch classes; there are no &quot;M/m thirds&quot; in the set, thus transpositions to those intervals don&apos;t maintain invariants. The set can be completely invariant under &quot;inversion&quot;: {B,Bb,F,C} (an useful information for counterpoint and serial music). From a more auditive approach, there are contrastant subsets, e.g: {C,F,Bb} (&quot;consonant&quot; 4ths) and {B,C,Bb} (&quot;dissonant&quot; semitones) -- but these yet share the interval 2 (Maj.2nd)...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Such informations could be used as hints when exploring new material (scales, chords...).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Set theory can analyse the subset contents (e.g. interval vector),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; set properties (e.g. symmetry, common tones under transposition),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; group pc sets in set classes and propose similarity criteria.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Take the index on the chain of fifths<br/>&gt; &gt; {B,C,F,Bb} -&gt; {5,0,-1,-2}<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be {11,0,5,10} in a chain of semitones...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Multiply each term by 7, for the number of nominals<br/>&gt; &gt; available<br/>&gt; &gt; {35,0,-7,-14}<br/>&gt; &gt; Add 4 because there are 4 pitch classes in play<br/>&gt; &gt; {39,4,-3,-10}<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could not follow that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mod 12 for the 12 pitch classes available<br/>&gt; &gt; {3,4,9,2}<br/>&gt; &gt; Map to chromatic degrees of 12-ET, with 0 degrees being<br/>&gt; &gt; the pitch class used as the 0th fifth earlier.<br/>&gt; &gt; {Eb,E,A,D}<br/>&gt; &gt; This transformation is definitely producing something<br/>&gt; &gt; similar!  (Actually it was my third try stringing arbitrary<br/>&gt; &gt; operations together, and they all produced something<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;similar&apos;).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Or, putting in another way, can the regular mapping model<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; provide information about the stuff -- *any* subsets --<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; available in a given scale/tuning? Or is it just a way to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; represent scales?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It lets us find optimal tunings for any scale.  It lets us<br/>&gt; &gt; find the scales, out of all possible scales, that are the<br/>&gt; &gt; natural competitors of the diatonic scale.  It shows us how<br/>&gt; &gt; these scales are related, and how they can be transformed<br/>&gt; &gt; into one another, or how music written in one can be cast<br/>&gt; &gt; into another.  It tells us when such recasting is likely to<br/>&gt; &gt; result in a qualitative change in the music vs. a more subtle<br/>&gt; &gt; sense that the same piece has simply been retuned.  etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Could the set {B,C,F,Bb} be considered a &quot;scale&quot; in that sense? How it could be related to other scales, or maybe used to generate other scales?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It doesn&apos;t tell us what notes to write once a scales and<br/>&gt; &gt; tunings have been selected.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If it can find scales &quot;that are the natural competitors of the diatonic scale&quot;, then I suppose it takes in account certain properties of subsets of those scales (for example: the number of subsets approximating 4:5:6 or other ratios).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am still seeking some common point between the two theorical approaches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Carl</p><p>I am a long ways off with unifying the two approaches myself,<br/>but I am making in-roads. And although this is more along lines<br/>of my conversation with Marcel, since it is the same Subject Thread, I&apos;ll respond here.

It&apos;s possible to canvas all hexachords with one or two tritones<br/>40 + 30) using just 10 pentachords * 7 (note left out) up<br/>to complementation and inversion. (I treat the cases with 0 tritones<br/>or 3 tritones separately). One hexachord in each row will be<br/>a Steiner Set from S(5,6,12) which is the basis of the M12 group.</p><p>2. These pentachords will all have one tritone in the 0,6 slots.</p><p>3. Map this onto the grid we have been discussing, (Using {3^-1, 3^0, 3^1, 3^2} X {5^-1, 5^0, 5^1} and map 1/1 to 3^0*5^0 as you would expect). For now, lets map the tritone to 1/1 and 45/1 or 45/32,<br/>assuming octave-equivalence.</p><p>4. Examine the remaining pitches and map them to fractions. One<br/>solution is this: (With my I-Ching notation)</p><p>AAA, (3.4.5)<br/>A-BA, (2.10.5)<br/>AA-A (2.3.5)<br/>BAA (8.3.4)<br/>B--AA (7.4.5)<br/>A-B-A (1.9.5)<br/>A-AA (1.3.4)<br/>BA--A (7.2.5)<br/>AB-A (1.8.4)<br/>AAA (1.2.3)</p><p>Which map to these fractions.*</p><p>1) 3/5, 5/1, 1/3<br/>2) 9/1, 9/5, 1/3<br/>3) 9/1, 3/5, 1/3<br/>4) 1/5, 3/5, 5/1<br/>5) 3/1, 5/1, 1/3<br/>6)1/15, 5/3, 1/3<br/>7)1/15, 3/5, 5/1<br/>8) 3/1, 9/1, 1/3<br/>9) 1/15, 1/5, 5/1<br/>10) 1/15, 9/1, 3/5</p><p>* If anyone can find a unifying pattern here, you win a virtual beer:)</p><p>Where pitches are as follows:</p><p>Fractions:</p><p>1&#x9;1/15<br/>2 &#x9;9<br/>3&#x9;3/5<br/>4&#x9;5/1<br/>5&#x9;1/3<br/>7&#x9;3/1<br/>8&#x9;1/5<br/>9&#x9;5/3<br/>10&#x9;9/5</p><p>We see that 11 is not used.

He tells you he did it (in the canonic<br/>&gt; riddle) so you&apos;re sure to be impressed.  If he were to throw<br/>&gt; the retrograde on top of the theme without bothering to<br/>&gt; harmonize it, that wouldn&apos;t have been impressive at all.  With<br/>&gt; Bach, the transformation was an arbitrary way to make the canon<br/>&gt; harder.  With serialists, the transformation is said to be a<br/>&gt; meaningful way to make harmony obsolete.  That&apos;s wrong.  It&apos;s<br/>&gt; not a matter of taste.  If you can&apos;t hear the transformation<br/>&gt; it&apos;s not meaningful, period.&quot;</p><p>(What is the source of that obscure phrase &quot;a meaningful way to make harmony obsolete&quot;?)</p><p>In my opinion, the usage of retrograde/inversion/etc. by serialists is not too different of Bach&apos;s usage: the &quot;arbitrary&quot; transformation needs additional conditions to work musically, it does not matter if the transformation can be (or should be) perceived as such (or not).</p><p>There should be superior compositional principles coordinating the application of the transformations: in certain cases, it is completely irrelevant that listeners can hear a transformation as such -- it matters the final effect, not the means. In such cases, the transformation is not used &quot;because it was an audible transformation, but because it&apos;s challenging to do it [i.e. to find a strictly canonical transformation of the original material that can meet a musical goal] and still harmonize the canon [i.e. to put it playing the musical game in a successful and organic way].&quot;</p><p>But there is another important point: the poetics of serial music usually intends to create complex textures that defy human perception. It sounds chaotic, yet it has a underlaying structure and an organization principle. Its perception is statistical and holistic. The rational techniques used to derivate material to compose it constrast with the stochastical apparence of the result -- a rather complex pitch organization may paradoxally lead to musical textures which do not seem to be pitch oriented, etc. In this poetics, transparent derivations of elemental components may not be very interesting -- they might lead to a local, analytical (and possibly discursive) hearing, instead of a global, textural, holistic hearing. The paradox of the rigorous underlaying organization and the apparently chaotic musical surface is an attractive feature of serial music.</p><p>[...]<br/>&gt; &gt; I am composing a serial piece for 17-EDO guitar, and I will<br/>&gt; &gt; use something I thought I would never use, because the result<br/>&gt; &gt; is &quot;too dissimilar&quot; to the origin: transformation by<br/>&gt; &gt; multiplication (just multiply the pitch class number by a<br/>&gt; &gt; constant factor).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In discussions with serialists on this list in the past, it<br/>&gt; has usually come down to, &quot;But I find these techniques inspire<br/>&gt; my compositions!&quot;  And of course, that&apos;s great!  Anything<br/>&gt; that inspires music needs no further justification.</p><p>The point of view of a composer is rather different of that of the theoric. Something &quot;works&quot; in a composition because the musical sensitivity and feeling of the composer approve it or require it -- but the fact that it &quot;works&quot; is only a syntactical requirement, subordinated to the compositional idea: it really &quot;works&quot; because it carries and accomplishes the compositional idea. (For example: a cadence dominant-&gt;tonic is used not because it &quot;makes sense in itself&quot;, but because it can carry certain kinds of musical ideas in a functional way -- it may be &quot;harmonically effective&quot; in a theoretical sense, but yet it may be misused in nonsense &quot;contexts&quot;).</p><p>It seems that there is no theory able to explain how atonal music really works; set theory can help us to see how it is organized, which is for sure better than nothing.</p><p>What are the achievements of regular mapping theory for analysis of atonal music, by the way?</p><p>[...]<br/>&gt; &gt; In mod13 there are also tetrachords with interval vector<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;111111&gt;; they could be used in Bohlen-Pierce scale, or in<br/>&gt; &gt; 13-EDO. In mod17, there are not such interval vectors, but<br/>&gt; &gt; there are ones like &lt;10111101&gt; or &lt;1111100&gt;, where two interval<br/>&gt; &gt; classes are absent. In mod10 and mod11, we have pentachords<br/>&gt; &gt; with vector &lt;22222&gt;. Interesting symmetry properties may be<br/>&gt; &gt; found in mod16, since 16 is 2*2*2*2 -- or perhaps it is the<br/>&gt; &gt; opposite: the symmetry may be excessive and boring (like the<br/>&gt; &gt; dim7-chord in 12-ET), an then the interesting sets might be<br/>&gt; &gt; the assymetrical ones -- how diverse are the subsets in mod16?<br/>&gt; &gt; How to effectively explore such properties in those<br/>&gt; &gt; uncommon scales?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems to me that most of the techniques are adaptable to<br/>&gt; microtonal scales.  You should definitely get in touch with<br/>&gt; Paul Hjelmistad, as he&apos;s done work in this area.</p><p>Let&apos;s see...</p><p>[...]<br/>&gt; &gt; It is completely invariant under multiplication by 7 (which is<br/>&gt; &gt; that &quot;other&quot; generator besides the semitone):<br/>&gt; [snip]<br/>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, simple adding does just a transposition:<br/>&gt; &gt; 4 semitones = Major 3rd.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed.  But there is a point to be made here regarding some<br/>&gt; music set theory papers I&apos;ve seen that claim to derive the<br/>&gt; diatonic scale from first principles.  As I mentioned, this<br/>&gt; was my third attempt at mutilating your set with simple<br/>&gt; operations based on famous numbers like 7, but none of them<br/>&gt; mutilated too much.  That&apos;s because 12 is a small, highly-<br/>&gt; composite number.</p><p>That total invariance under multiplication only was possible because: (1) you have multiplied the set by a number which does not share any factors with 12; (2) for coincidence, that set had that property -- while the highly-composite number 12 _makes possible_ the property, I guess there is a reduced number of sets which map themselves by multiplication. Had you multiplied it by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10... you could easily achieve your goal to mutilate it!</p><p>&gt;  It&apos;s easy to do things in 12 that produce<br/>&gt; meaningful scales because almost all scales in 12 are<br/>&gt; meaningful, because 12 happens to be an insanely great<br/>&gt; temperament in terms of logflat badness.  This is my gripe --<br/>&gt; it&apos;s regular mapping that has truly derived the diatonic<br/>&gt; scale (and 12-ET) from first principles, since it could go<br/>&gt; wrong with things like 11-ET and so on.  If we assume 12 we<br/>&gt; cannot go too wrong.</p><p>Indeed, if the number of pitches is a prime number, then all factors would result in different sets.</p><p>[...]<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Could the set {B,C,F,Bb} be considered a &quot;scale&quot; in that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sense? How it could be related to other scales, or maybe used<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to generate other scales?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The kind of scales I was referring to here must have a mapping<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to the generators of the desired chord(s).  So {B,C,F,Bb} can<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; be the desired chord or the scale.  If it&apos;s both, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; temperament mapping is trivial and not very interesting.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I mean: a scale when comparing it to other scales.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hm.  In regular mapping, we compare scales against a target.<br/>&gt; Is {B,C,F,Bb} a scale or the target?  If 4:3 were the<br/>&gt; target {B,C,F,Bb} is doing OK because it contains two 4:3<br/>&gt; intervals in four notes.  But it would be inferior to<br/>&gt; {G,C,F,Bb} which contains three 4:3 intervals.</p><p>But -- from another standpoint -- {G,C,F,Bb} is relatively &quot;poor&quot; as it contains only 3 different intervals and it is redundant concerning to interval class 5 (P4th). {B,C,F,Bb} is more rich in the number of different intervals available (4), and {C,E,F#,G} yet more (6).</p><p>Maybe I should ask: what can be said comparing 12-EDO against every one of its subsets as target?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A mapping is a group theory operation. I am wondering if pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; class set theory and regular mappings could be used in a<br/>&gt; &gt; complementary way, each one providing useful insights and tools<br/>&gt; &gt; for each other.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure.  It bears further thought.  We are used to<br/>&gt; fighting music set theory bitterly.  I much prefer the idea<br/>&gt; of cooperation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>Have you read &quot;Introduction to post-tonal theory&quot; by Richard N. Straus?

Not all regular mapping theorists agree<br/>with it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; As far as Bach, I recently wrote this on tuning-math:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Bach used things like retrograde not because it was an audible<br/>&gt; &gt; transformation, but because it&apos;s challenging to do it and still<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonize the canon.  He tells you he did it (in the canonic<br/>&gt; &gt; riddle) so you&apos;re sure to be impressed.  If he were to throw<br/>&gt; &gt; the retrograde on top of the theme without bothering to<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonize it, that wouldn&apos;t have been impressive at all.  With<br/>&gt; &gt; Bach, the transformation was an arbitrary way to make the canon<br/>&gt; &gt; harder.  With serialists, the transformation is said to be a<br/>&gt; &gt; meaningful way to make harmony obsolete.  That&apos;s wrong.  It&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; not a matter of taste.  If you can&apos;t hear the transformation<br/>&gt; &gt; it&apos;s not meaningful, period.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (What is the source of that obscure phrase &quot;a meaningful way to<br/>&gt; make harmony obsolete&quot;?)</p><p>I wrote it on Friday.

To be completely honest, I think it was a fad.  Back<br/>before the era of computing, the idea of experiencing all<br/>permutations of something probably seemed interesting.  Today<br/>we are surrounded by generative possibilities like this.  And<br/>the idea of not having control appealed to the philosophy of<br/>the day.  The wars created a huge backlash against classicism<br/>and a desire for modernity at any cost.

Of course it does!  Then we have<br/>claims of tone rows appearing in Mozart and so on.  Nonsense!</p><p>&gt; What are the achievements of regular mapping theory for<br/>&gt; analysis of atonal music, by the way?</p><p>I&apos;m not aware it&apos;s been tried.  We have apparently been able<br/>to derive a few popular indigenous scale species, though even<br/>here a systematic review has yet to be done.  Keep in mind<br/>most of us have day jobs!</p><p>&gt; &gt; In regular mapping, we compare scales against a target.<br/>&gt; &gt; Is {B,C,F,Bb} a scale or the target?  If 4:3 were the<br/>&gt; &gt; target {B,C,F,Bb} is doing OK because it contains two 4:3<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals in four notes.  But it would be inferior to<br/>&gt; &gt; {G,C,F,Bb} which contains three 4:3 intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But -- from another standpoint -- {G,C,F,Bb} is relatively<br/>&gt; &quot;poor&quot; as it contains only 3 different intervals and it is<br/>&gt; redundant concerning to interval class 5 (P4th).</p><p>Note, in this example I established P4 as the target, so<br/>being redundant in it would be considered good.</p><p>&gt; Maybe I should ask: what can be said comparing 12-EDO against<br/>&gt; every one of its subsets as target?</p><p>If you happen to choose a subset that approximates a 5-limit<br/>consonance, then it does extremely well!</p><p>&gt; Have you read &quot;Introduction to post-tonal theory&quot; by Richard<br/>&gt; N.

Back in 2002, I began to use a unit which made this possible to me. I called it the &quot;epimoric denominator&quot; or ED. You can get it by &quot;1/(f-1)&quot;, where &quot;f&quot; is the linear factor. So an octave of 2/1 has an ED of 1, a fifth of 3/2 has an ED of 2, and a major sixth of 5/3 has an ED of 1.5 (you may also understand it by saying that 5/3 is between 4/2 and 6/4). It also makes it possible to better imagine an approximate amount of &quot;mistuning&quot; of two tones, because it tells you which frequencies you have to mix to get a 1Hz difference. For example, the syntonic comma of 81/80 has an ED of 80 while the Pyth. comma of (3^12)/(2^19) has an ED of ~73.296, which means that it&apos;s larger than the syntonic comma. On the other hand, the 5-limit schisma of 32805/32768 has an ED of ~885.622, which can tell you that this must be something pretty small. Similarly, the ED for the ordinary 100-cent semitone is ~16.817, which means that it&apos;s closer to 18/17 than to 17/16.</p><p>The important thing to remember here is that negative numbers don&apos;t represent the same intervals as positive numbers do. For example, while the ED for a rising 5-limit major third is 4, the ED for a falling major third is -5 because the denominator of the ratio is supposed to be always 1 less than the numerator (4/5 is the same as &quot;(-4)/(-5)&quot;).</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=86011 href="#86011">ðŸ”—</a>cameron &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2010 2:59:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>You patented John Harrison&apos;s tuning?</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, although a copyright infringement case my lawyers here advise me could &quot;fly&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 3 Feb 2010, at 17:27, Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Has the patent not yet expired?<br/>&gt; &gt; -Mike<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Wed, Feb 3, 2010 at 7:30 AM, Charles Lucy &lt;lucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I hadn&apos;t worried to sue David Doty for libel, when he cast doubts on my engineering qualifications, in his biased review of LucyTuning back in the eighties, nor Carl for his rantings.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Although this time it may well be worth it.

But inversely related sets may (or may not, according to the case) sound similar in some degree.</p><p>I am not claming that the inversion is generally valid as an equivalence relation, as several set theorists may defend. As I have said, Larry Solomon does not agree with this reduction, and only accepts transposition as canonical transformation. Solomon additionally tries to find similarity relations between sets which are not related by transposition. I think that set similarity outside the defined &quot;set classes&quot; are important and should be more investigated.</p><p>BTW, there are sets in atonal music that I recognize by its set class, although I need to think a bit to know if its is a &quot;prime&quot; ou &quot;inverse&quot; form. That is not always due to some &quot;similarity&quot;, but I suppose it is mainly due to learnt cathegorization (something like calling &quot;7th chords&quot; structures as different as {G,B,D#,F} and {G,Bb,Db,F#}). In this sense, atonal composers may be somewhat induced by the association of inversely related sets, just because they are used in atonal music.</p><p>Please compare the chords A, B, C and D above. I am sure you can find similarities and differences between them, by ear. Sets are not &quot;just&quot; completely different of each other, with nearly zero audible similarity and period; we can go further.</p><p>There are a lot of different sets used in atonal music, thus some reduction and grouping is required to handle them. Set theory is frequently accused of excessive reduction at the very first analytical steps: it is a fair criticism. By the other hand, with all its defects, it showed to be useful in analysis of atonal music and inspirative for composition.</p><p>&gt; At least, I&apos;m aware of no evidence that it is audible.  That&apos;s<br/>&gt; really the difference.  If a relation is to be used as an<br/>&gt; *explanation* it should be subjected to experiment.

In Schoenberg&apos;s music, the ear and inteligence acts all the time, intensely.</p><p>Still about the interaction between technique and material: replace a tone-row for another in a dodecaphonic music by Berg or Boulez, and then you will get real cacophony, because an acidental replacement will cause pitch relations which are inconsistent with the style and structure.</p><p>[...]<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems that there is no theory able to explain how atonal<br/>&gt; &gt; music really works; set theory can help us to see how it is<br/>&gt; &gt; organized, which is for sure better than nothing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I generate a piece using technique X, it is hardly fair to<br/>&gt; say technique X explains it.

I recall the second part of the book is rather abstract.</p><p>However, as I wrote before: there are no successful approaches to analyse atonal music, and set theory proved to be at least a positive contribution anyway. I think it is not sufficient and it tends to be too much reductive, ignoring important aspects of human musical perception. But there are too rare explanatory approaches, then it cannot be safely discarded yet.</p><p>As with any approach that uses non-musical concepts, it is subject to misuse in hands of people more inclined to maths than to music.</p><p>&gt; &quot;Any musician who has not experienced - I do not say<br/>&gt; understood, but truly experienced - the necessity of<br/>&gt; dodecaphonic music is USELESS.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a very famous quote but it&apos;s worth thinking about.<br/>&gt; What kind of artist says this about all forms other than<br/>&gt; his own?  And this was not a fringe artist, but one of the<br/>&gt; leaders of the movement!</p><p>Arrogance, ego/euro/centricism and proselitism are not under discussion here. We are better off listening to Boulez&apos;s music rather than taking seriously such (out)dated claims.</p><p>BTW, I have found this &quot;definition&quot; in a text about regular mappings, which is not constructive either:</p><p>&quot;Atonal Music<br/>     Music with lots of wrong notes.&quot;</p><p>You know that many naive attempts of composing microtonal music based on triads are nothing more than out-of-tune tonal/modal music (because they use harmonic material that is inconsistent with the tuning used). From your description, I undertand that regular mapping can catch such errors, allowing one to find suitable tunings for the chosen harmonic material. (I find that Neo-old(19) sounds mistuned, although I am not sure that other tunings can maintain the intended relations, harmonic ambiguities, etc. I have made a few tries with Secor&apos;s 19-WT, but I only tested two keys. An adaptative temperament would be welcome, and I implicitely assume that one should be used if the piece were played in acoustical instruments.)</p><p>By the other side, as composer, I often feel that some specific pitch (and only that pitch) is required in certain moment of a &quot;free&quot; atonal music. The choice of the components of a chord affects the next chord, and so on; certain pitches do work, other ones don&apos;t. Which are the patterns and rules governing those selections? I assume there are (psycho)acoustical principles (can regular mapping theory here?), &quot;motivic&quot; patterns (pitch sets?), as well as other factors. There may be &quot;wrong notes&quot; or pitches with secondary relevance or that are somewhat indifferent, but there is also a selection by ear, so that the music sounds this way rather than in a different way. This cannot be explained by simply referring to a technical method used in the composition (the &quot;technique&quot; may have been &quot;I just selected the notes intuitively by ear&quot;).</p><p>I am not interested in void polemics, as opposing pitch set theory and regular mapping as one right/good other wrong/bad, or serial music against low-primes just intonation music etc. I am interested in to learn about how microtonal scales can be used to accomplish tonal, modal, chromatic, atonal, serial _and_ other kinds of music.</p><p>For example, I am currently interested in pitch structures that are rich in ambiguities and that can suggest multiple potential meanings. That preference leads me to avoid simple consonanses as uninteresting (because they usually can be easily reduced to a single fundamental, inducing the perception to make that reduction), although the presence of some consonances is required to suggest potential harmonic meanings. Such pitch structures should be suitable for tonal (&quot;extended tonality&quot;) and atonal (&quot;pantonal&quot;) music.</p><p>Hudson</p></div><h3><a id=86016 href="#86016">ðŸ”—</a>hfmlacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2010 8:15:43 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I should stress that I&apos;m sure I lack many of the listening<br/>&gt; &gt; skills of an experienced fan of atonal/serial music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the record, I have an album of Schoenberg&apos;s first four<br/>&gt; string quartets, and the first is among the most powerful<br/>&gt; pieces of music I&apos;ve ever heard.<br/>&gt;  I also enjoyed these:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sechs_kleine_Klavierst%C3%BCcke">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sechs_kleine_Klavierst%C3%BCcke</a></p><p>I have made and played a transcription for two guitars of Op.19.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; After favoring these, I learned they are both atonal but<br/>&gt; predate his formal use of serialism...</p><p>Op. 19 is &quot;free atonal&quot;.</p><p>But String Quartet N.1 in D minor is tonal (extended tonality); are you referring to another quartet?</p><p>The 4th movement of Quartet N.2, with soprano voice, may be considered atonal:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Schoenberg_Quartet_No._2_4th_movement.OGG">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Schoenberg_Quartet_No._2_4th_movement.OGG</a></p><p>Quartets 3 and 4 are dodecaphonic.

Back in 2002, I began to use a unit which made this possible to me. I called it the &quot;epimoric denominator&quot; or ED. You can get it by &quot;1/(f-1)&quot;, where &quot;f&quot; is the linear factor. So an octave of 2/1 has an ED of 1, a fifth of 3/2 has an ED of 2, and a major sixth of 5/3 has an ED of 1.5 (you may also understand it by saying that 5/3 is between 4/2 and 6/4). It also makes it possible to better imagine an approximate amount of &quot;mistuning&quot; of two tones, because it tells you which frequencies you have to mix to get a 1Hz difference. For example, the syntonic comma of 81/80 has an ED of 80 while the Pyth. comma of (3^12)/(2^19) has an ED of ~73.296, which means that it&apos;s larger than the syntonic comma. On the other hand, the 5-limit schisma of 32805/32768 has an ED of ~885.622, which can tell you that this must be something pretty small. Similarly, the ED for the ordinary 100-cent semitone is<br/> ~16.817, which means that it&apos;s closer to 18/17 than to 17/16.<br/>The important thing to remember here is that negative numbers don&apos;t represent the same intervals as positive numbers do. For example, while the ED for a rising 5-limit major third is 4, the ED for a falling major third is -5 because the denominator of the ratio is supposed to be always 1 less than the numerator (4/5 is the same as &quot;(-4)/(-5)&quot;) .<br/>Petr<br/>&nbsp;</p><p>      __________________________________________________________________________________<br/>Yahoo!7: Catch-up on your favourite Channel 7 TV shows easily, legally, and for free at PLUS7. <a href="http://www.tv.yahoo.com.au/plus7">www.tv.yahoo.com.au/plus7</a></p></div><h3><a id=86024 href="#86024">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/4/2010 8:19:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;I find it interesting that you say 5/3 is between 4/2 and 6/4 (2<br/>&amp; 3/2) yet 7/4 is also 2 and 3/2.

Can you do it<br/>&gt; &gt; easily?  Then we could ask people their opinions.  Maybe we<br/>&gt; &gt; could present them as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and ask people which they<br/>&gt; &gt; think is the original piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would be really interesting. Boulez&apos; music is very hard<br/>&gt; to analyse, but there are extensive (maybe I should write<br/>&gt; &quot;obsessive&quot;) papers on some works. Remapping the series would be<br/>&gt; another complex task. But dodecaphonic music is simpler, and the<br/>&gt; experiment could be accomplished. Perhaps someone already have<br/>&gt; tried that.</p><p>Very well then, dodecaphonic it is.  Following the tradition<br/>of guerrilla theory here, I think we&apos;ll do best by doing it<br/>ourselves.  And by we I mean you :) since I don&apos;t know enough<br/>about dodecaphonic music to help...</p><p>&gt; Anyway, I have several issues concerning to the mapping:<br/>&gt; -- How to deal with octave instances so that the overall pitch<br/>&gt; disposition may be held when possible in the modified version?<br/>&gt; -- Regarding to series transpositions, specially when inverted,<br/>&gt; how to select the transposition level in a consistent way?<br/>&gt; -- Should substitute tone row share structural features with the<br/>&gt; original series?<br/>&gt; -- Furthermore, how to handle invariance and imbrication between<br/>&gt; series? (e.g. symmetry in Webern&apos;s Op. 27 and most of his pieces)<br/>&gt; -- What kind of dodecaphonic music should be suitable for this<br/>&gt; experiment?</p><p>...see what I mean?</p><p>&gt; But there are some simple dodecaphonic study pieces that uses<br/>&gt; a single repeated tone row, and simple transformations. Maybe<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s theme from Op.31 (Variations for orchestra) can be<br/>&gt; suitable (just the melody, with no accompaniment?).</p><p>Yes, simple is good.  But how would we produce cacophony, as<br/>you claim, without the accompaniment?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Again, isn&apos;t this backwards?  You speak as if atonal music was<br/>&gt; &gt; a flourishing natural genre before serialism / set theory came<br/>&gt; &gt; along to explain it.  Hardly!  Try set theory on one of the few<br/>&gt; &gt; 19th-century atonal pieces.  No, it only works (if you consider<br/>&gt; &gt; it working at all) when it was used to create the composition.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No. As I understand it, pitch class set theory has been developed<br/>&gt; since around 1960. That is: about 10 years after Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; death, 40 years after he developed his 12-tone technique, and<br/>&gt; around 50 (or more) years after early atonal music.</p><p>I said &quot;serialism / set theory&quot;.  And categorizing the likes<br/>of Scriabin, Busoni, Stravinksy and Ives into a genre including<br/>Schoenberg and the 2nd Viennese school is a revisionist fantasy,<br/>at best.</p><p>&gt; I am with Allen Forte&apos;s &quot;The Structure of Atonal Music&quot;, one<br/>&gt; of the most important books on the matter, published in 1973,</p><p>I suppose I should read this, since everything seems to depend<br/>on it.  I&apos;ve placed it in my Amazon cart.  Actually the cover<br/>looks familiar - I may have a copy in storage somewhere.  I&apos;ve<br/>been told to read it on several occasions.  As you can probably<br/>guess, I&apos;m doubtful it explains much of anything, let alone the<br/>structure of atonal music.</p><p>&gt; &gt; We&apos;ve developed techniques to find optimal tunings given the<br/>&gt; &gt; commas that &apos;vanish&apos; in the score.  We can also do things like<br/>&gt; &gt; remap 4:5:6 to any other consonant triad like 5:7:9.  The<br/>&gt; &gt; results may not sound good, but they&apos;ll sound better than<br/>&gt; &gt; simply remapping chromatically to a scale containing 5:7:9<br/>&gt; &gt; chords.  And Erv Wilson and Marcus Hobbs have worked out some<br/>&gt; &gt; other very interesting transformations...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Interesting.

A) The GCD frequency (which in this case is the same as the difference frequency) is clearly audible. B) There is no beating in these intervals because they have a steady &bdquo;guide tone&ldquo; (which equals to the LCM frequency). Some people might argue that they find the sound of 5/3 as &bdquo;clear&ldquo; as 5/4 or 4/3 but, at least from my subjective listening tests, I don&rsquo;t. So if I describe an interval using the unit I call ED, I can quickly get a rough mental image of how &bdquo;tuned&ldquo; or &bdquo;mistuned&ldquo; an interval may sound to me. If the ED is an integer, that means the ratio is epimoric.</p><p>&gt; Have you made some music that can be heard on the web.</p><p>Well, concerning my great interest in epimoric intervals back in 2002, I made something called &bdquo;In the epimoric world&ldquo;. At first, it was just a name for a 12-tone scale. Later, it was actually a name for a piece of music. If you have a copy of Manuel&rsquo;s &bdquo;Scale archive&ldquo;, you can find the 12-tone scale there under the name of &bdquo;parizek_epiworld.scl&ldquo;. As to the music, maybe I could upload it and let you hear it if you&rsquo;re interested.</p><p>&gt; My point of reference is learnign to use a Just 5 limit scale and the relationships between the notes.<br/>&gt; I am trying to deeply understand consonance (as defined in Indian and Greek music)<br/>&gt; and how to return there from all manner of &apos;interesting dissonances&apos;. I find the JI scale is<br/>&gt; made of 5 limit epimoric ratios: 9/8, 10/9, 16/15, 3/2 etc.</p><p>There are loads of 5-limit JI scales. Do you mean one scale in particular?</p><p>&gt; I find it interesting that you say 5/3 is between 4/2 and 6/4 (2 &amp; 3/2)<br/>&gt; yet 7/4 is also 2 and 3/2. Are there different ways of looking at between?</p><p>Again, there are many possible answers to what &bdquo;between&ldquo; means. What you&rsquo;ve done is the &bdquo;arithmetic mean&ldquo; like (a+b)/2. Another way is the &bdquo;geometric mean&ldquo; like sqrt(a*b). And another is the one which I don&rsquo;t know by its proper name but I call it the &bdquo;partial mean&ldquo;. It goes like (2*a*b-a-b) / (a+b-2). That&rsquo;s the one that comes out when you make an &bdquo;arithmetic mean&ldquo; of two EDs.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t quite get this yet. Could you say more to someone who has just learnt<br/>&gt; to multiply and divide fractions?</p><p>Well, imagine a unit that describes intervals as the lower of the two relative frequencies, leaving a constant difference of 1 between them. In the case of epimoric intervals, this equals to the denominator. So in the case of 2/1, the ED is 1 because you get an octave by mixing 1Hz and 2Hz. For 3/2 the ED is 2 because you get a perfect fifth by mixing 2Hz and 3Hz (the difference of 1 again). Now imagine something like 5/3. This is basically the same as 2.5/1.5 and therefore the ED is 1.5 (the difference of 1 is preserved). And now let&rsquo;s look at a falling perfect fifth of 2/3. The rule for epimoric ratios says that the denominator is 1 lower than the numerator. But since 3 is higher than 2 and not lower, we can&rsquo;t use this as our starting factor for the ED conversion. Because &bdquo;minus times minus is plus&ldquo;, we can substitue our 2/3 with (-2)/(-3) so that the denominator really is 1 lower than the numerator. But, you see, since the 2 and 3 are now swapped, the ED value can&rsquo;t be the same. So while an ED for 3/2 is 2, the ED for 2/3 is -3.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=86033 href="#86033">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2010 9:47:30 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr&gt;&quot;B) There is no beating in these intervals because they have a<br/>steady &bdquo;guide tone&ldquo; (which equals to the LCM frequency).&quot;</p><p>     Correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but it seems obvious to me there IS beating, it just happens to beat along the LCM (thus it beats in the form of &quot;periodic distortion&quot;, but still beats).</p><p>&gt;&quot;we can substitue our 2/3 with (-2)/(-3) so<br/>that the denominator really is 1 lower than the numerator.

At the moment where one of them falls to 0, the higher one is at 1, which means that the ED of 0 is essentially nonsense because it represents a ratio of 1/0. If the tones still go on changing the pitches, then later one is at -0.5Hz and the other is at +0.5Hz, which would be expressed as -0.5 in ED. Even later, the &bdquo;lower&ldquo; frequency would reach -1 and the upper one would get to 0, which means that an ED of -1 means a ratio of &bdquo;0/(-1)&ldquo; or 0/1, which is more or less &bdquo;silence&ldquo; rather than a relative pitch. And even later, the &bdquo;lower&ldquo; frequency gets to -2 and the &bdquo;upper&ldquo; one gets to -1, which means that an ED of -2 means a ratio of &bdquo;(-1)/(-2)&ldquo; or 1/2.

You&rsquo;re talking about the general periodicity of the dyad, which is, as far as what I&rsquo;ve read, not called beating. This has a lot to do with the GCD frequency, while the &bdquo;beating&ldquo; I meant has a lot to do with the LCM. If you mix two sawtooth periods of 40Hz and 70Hz, you get another resulting period whose &bdquo;general&ldquo; frequency is 10Hz (I know that saying &bdquo;general&ldquo; is a bit strange but I want to stress the fact that this frequency of 10Hz would also be there whether you added 100Hz or 110Hz or 90Hz or all of these or none of these to that sound). It is actually the GCD of the sounding frequencies and most papers I&rsquo;ve read call this the &bdquo;fundamental frequency&ldquo; of the dyad. OTOH, the &bdquo;guide tone&ldquo;, which equals to the LCM of the sounding frequencies, is 280Hz in this case. Unless one of the two periods changes its frequency, the guide tone is locked in phase. This means that if you start with both periods at a common phase, then the guide tone comes out as loud as possible, including all other integer multiples. In contrast, if one of the two tones starts at 0 degrees while the other starts at 180, the guide tone and its multiples never appear.</p><p>#2. I was wrong when I said that the beating in the harmonics of 51Hz and 61Hz could be simulated with amplitude modulation, as this is only true for sine waves and therefore would only count for the actual dyad of 305Hz and 306Hz but not for its overtones. I should have said &bdquo;by mixing two frequencies of 305Hz and 306Hz&ldquo;. Anyway, talking of harmonic spectra like sawtooth and such, the process might really be simulated by amplitude modulation but in a very difficult way -- i.e. by modulating a sine of 305.5Hz with a sine of 0.5Hz, then modulating a sine of 611Hz with a sine of 1Hz, and so on, and mixing all of these individual modulated results.</p><p>&gt;   Here&apos;s a question, what happens if you do the same thing with the much smaller ratio 16/15<br/>&gt; IE 160hz and 150hz...is there still no &quot;aubible&quot; beating and, if so, why not?<br/>&gt;  Judging by your example, I&apos;d guess the LCM would be some very high frequency.</p><p>Of course, the LCM is 2400Hz in this case. It&rsquo;s important to know where in the spectrum you want to look for the beats. Surely there&rsquo;s no beating at 2400Hz in this example if we don&rsquo;t change one of the pitches. But the GCD of 10Hz is audible as a new kind of periodicity often referred to as the fundamental frequency. However, this has nothing to do with the phenomenon of beating that helps you in tuning tempered intervals, for example.</p><p>&gt;     I&apos;m trying to relate the concept of melodically switching between two tones to, say,<br/>&gt; your &quot;falling tone&quot; example IE &quot;Suppose you have two tones which keep falling linearly<br/>&gt; at a constant speed and are 1Hz apart.&quot;....</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s much I could say about this.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=86053 href="#86053">ðŸ”—</a>hfmlacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2010 8:47:21 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hfmlacerda&quot; &lt;hfmlacerda@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Any transformation one can dream up may produce two similar<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sounding chords in some cases.  That doesn&apos;t mean anything.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you&apos;re talking about something real, it&apos;ll always hold.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Using extreme registers may do a single pitch class set to sound<br/>&gt; &gt; different in different dispositions, using only octave<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;equivalence&quot;. Thus, &quot;always hold&quot; is also relative :-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think so.  Octave equivalence is hardly absolute,<br/>&gt; but it always works however well it does.  And it scales like<br/>&gt; physical phenomena -- a jump of 2 octavse sounds less similar<br/>&gt; than a jump of single octave.  The failure of inversion is<br/>&gt; of a different kind.</p><p>Some points:</p><p>* If you take your chord 4:5:6:7:9:11:13 and permutate the pitches in the pitch range, you can easily get sonorities that does not resemble too much the original disposition, just moving the pitches across octaves. For instance, let 11 or 13 be the bass note, hide the fundamental (4) inside the chord near 7 or 9, put 6 as a semitone of 11 or 13, etc. If you temper the chord, then the similarity of the several dispositions will vary according to the temperament. I think that one can get a (dis)similarity degree not too distant of some dispositions of the corresponding utonal inverse chord.</p><p>* Similarity relations between pitch sets are difficult to define and classify. Several year ago I was tempted to explore such possibilities (considering pitch range, register, disposition, not reducing pitches to pitch classes, etc.), and gave up because the untractable large number of possible combinations. If you reduce the number of objects to analyse (e.g. consonant chords built on 5-limit intervals), you can do a refined job; otherwise, as in atonal music, drastical reduction may be justified, given the large amount, complexity and variety of the pitch combinations which are used. &quot;Set theory&quot; is not generally about similarity, but essentially about structural (intervalar) properties of sets, as they are supposed to be used in atonal composition, or as they are found in analysis.</p><p>* I think &quot;similarity&quot; is a bad word to describe the relation between inverse pc sets, as it suggests immediate association at listening. Even &quot;equivalence&quot;, which is a proper technical name (once the mapping function is defined), can be interpreted in an exaggerated or misled way. I use to think &quot;equivalence under inversion&quot; and other pc set relations as quantitative features which represent _potential_ capabilities or resources of a set or some sets. I mean: you only can write a rigorous mirror using inversely related sets, and you only can have an exact transposition of a chord using transposition related sets, by definition; you can use the sets (in music) to make those relations explicit or not, and you can show them partially; but if the sets are not equivalent, then you only can obtain (at most) partial correspondences.</p><p>* If the universe is 12-EDO, according to Forte, _every_ pc set with n=5 or n=7 elements can hold a subset with n-1 elements invariant under inversion, except some sets which are completely invariant under inversion (mapping themselves). In those cases, at least, the similarity between inversion related sets can be strongly represented (e.g. by presenting a high number of common tones between two chords).</p><p>* The interval vector resumes important relations (in special the number of common tones between a set and its transposition to every interval class), which are shared by sets with equal interval vectors (transpositions, inversions ans &quot;Z-related&quot; sets); whether these sets can or cannot be presented so that they sound &quot;similar&quot; is another issue: basically they share a common quantitative feature, from which can be extracted potential usages and other conclusions.<br/>For example, Forte have found that _any_ 5-tone subsets of 12-EDO contain at least one M3 (or m6) -- therefore, a major third as subset is of null relevance as distinctive feature of a given pentachord; you need at least 2 M3 to make a difference. (You can select any 5 different pitches in a single octave in a completely random way, play them as a chord (or cluster) and then hold only two pitches in a M3/m6. Or, conversely, you can hold a fixed M3 and superpose to it a succession of different 3-tone chords, eventually presenting every possible 5-tone chord type with no repetition.)<br/>If the interval vector of a set shows a lot of M2s, or a lot of P4s, one can have some idea of how it may sound, etc. Just don&apos;t ask the interval vector more than it can answer, and you can find it useful. (You can surely imagine: there is a lot of delirious &quot;extensions&quot; and &quot;applications&quot; to this &quot;set theory&quot; around) :-)</p><p>* To be clear: I don&apos;t consider &quot;pitch-class set theory&quot; as a &quot;theory&quot;; of course it cannot be called a &quot;music theory&quot; (there is no the &quot;music theory&quot; thing). Its &quot;name&quot; (which I think is not defined anywhere) is just a way to relate concepts and applications, namely: apply _set theory_ concepts to analyse _pitch_ relations in atonal _music_. It only can classify objects (pitch sets) in a manageable way after using several equivalence reductions (essentially: octave and &quot;enharmony&quot;, for pitches, and then transposition, for sets); since atonal music uses a lot of the possible pitch combinations available in 12-EDO, additional reductions are required so that sets can be groupped: then one can evoke inversion equivalence, similarity relations, etc. Procedures are used to analyse combinatorial capabilities of 12-EDO, and set properties, etc. and to represent the results in a compact way. The whole collection of concepts and operative tools is applied in atonal music analysis, mainly for statistical analysis. The _musical_ analysis is to be made upon the raised and tabulated data, checking the real musical relevance of the outputs.</p><p>[...]<br/>&gt; &gt; That would be really interesting. Boulez&apos; music is very hard<br/>&gt; &gt; to analyse, but there are extensive (maybe I should write<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;obsessive&quot;) papers on some works. Remapping the series would be<br/>&gt; &gt; another complex task. But dodecaphonic music is simpler, and the<br/>&gt; &gt; experiment could be accomplished. Perhaps someone already have<br/>&gt; &gt; tried that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Very well then, dodecaphonic it is.  Following the tradition<br/>&gt; of guerrilla theory here, I think we&apos;ll do best by doing it<br/>&gt; ourselves.  And by we I mean you :) since I don&apos;t know enough<br/>&gt; about dodecaphonic music to help...</p><p>:-)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, I have several issues concerning to the mapping:<br/>&gt; &gt; -- How to deal with octave instances so that the overall pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; disposition may be held when possible in the modified version?<br/>&gt; &gt; -- Regarding to series transpositions, specially when inverted,<br/>&gt; &gt; how to select the transposition level in a consistent way?<br/>&gt; &gt; -- Should substitute tone row share structural features with the<br/>&gt; &gt; original series?<br/>&gt; &gt; -- Furthermore, how to handle invariance and imbrication between<br/>&gt; &gt; series? (e.g. symmetry in Webern&apos;s Op. 27 and most of his pieces)<br/>&gt; &gt; -- What kind of dodecaphonic music should be suitable for this<br/>&gt; &gt; experiment?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...see what I mean?</p><p>A sophisticated form of experiment design would try contemplate several possibilities.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But there are some simple dodecaphonic study pieces that uses<br/>&gt; &gt; a single repeated tone row, and simple transformations. Maybe<br/>&gt; &gt; Schoenberg&apos;s theme from Op.31 (Variations for orchestra) can be<br/>&gt; &gt; suitable (just the melody, with no accompaniment?).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, simple is good.  But how would we produce cacophony, as<br/>&gt; you claim, without the accompaniment?</p><p>By presenting inconsistent (ilogical) pitch relations, when replacing the original series with another in an arbitrary way. In special, tonal relations may appear in some moments, with no logical consequences, sounding accidental, wrong, without defined style or language. Usually, in atonal music, tonal allusions are carefully controled, for a harmonically balanced result.</p><p>But the theme of Op.31 has a chordal accompaniment that I think it is simple -- however, the orchestration is crucial to suavize dissonances; I am not sure a MIDI file can obtain the delicate result.</p><p>AFAICR, the theme uses tone rows that complement the melody tones forming aggregates (12-tone sets) -- that is, 6 theme notes are harmonized by the remaining 6 notes, but from another series instance. This simple procedure was target of a harsh criticism by Pierre Boulez. However, it is impressive the way that Schoenberg explores the 12-tone series to obtain sets as diverse as the dim7 chord (with resolution on a P5!) which opens the work, or the BACH sequence (presented at the 2nd part of the introduction, and explored at the finale), for example. The series does not contain either of these sets: they are obtained by combining different serial forms (O,R,I,RI and transpositions).</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6BzLwHLKis&feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6BzLwHLKis&feature=related</a><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GymJUFFwlI&feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GymJUFFwlI&feature=related</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, isn&apos;t this backwards?  You speak as if atonal music was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a flourishing natural genre before serialism / set theory came<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; along to explain it.  Hardly!  Try set theory on one of the few<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 19th-century atonal pieces.  No, it only works (if you consider<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it working at all) when it was used to create the composition.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; No. As I understand it, pitch class set theory has been developed<br/>&gt; &gt; since around 1960. That is: about 10 years after Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; death, 40 years after he developed his 12-tone technique, and<br/>&gt; &gt; around 50 (or more) years after early atonal music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I said &quot;serialism / set theory&quot;.</p><p>Then there is some communication noise here, I could not understand you yet.</p><p>Atonal music predates serialism, and atonal music predates pitch-class set theory. Serialism is not a theory nor an analytic method, but a collection of procedures used in composition; it is not intended to explain atonal music and cannot do it. Furthermore, pitch-class set theory (a misname, BTW), which is related to 50s-60s serialists (Milton Babbitt defined several of its core concepts), introduces several concepts that did not exist before, and applies them in atonal music analysis.</p><p>&gt;  And categorizing the likes<br/>&gt; of Scriabin, Busoni, Stravinksy and Ives into a genre including<br/>&gt; Schoenberg and the 2nd Viennese school is a revisionist fantasy,<br/>&gt; at best.</p><p>Forte was not simply classifying every and whatever music by Scriabin or Stravisnky as &quot;atonal&quot;. Music with non-functional harmony, using 12-tone scale and non-classified chords share characteristics with atonal music. The number of examples from Stravisnky&apos;s and Scriabin&apos;s pieces is higher than I could expect (but the large majority is from 2nd Viennese school, as one could expect).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I am with Allen Forte&apos;s &quot;The Structure of Atonal Music&quot;, one<br/>&gt; &gt; of the most important books on the matter, published in 1973,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I suppose I should read this, since everything seems to depend<br/>&gt; on it.  I&apos;ve placed it in my Amazon cart.  Actually the cover<br/>&gt; looks familiar - I may have a copy in storage somewhere.  I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; been told to read it on several occasions.  As you can probably<br/>&gt; guess, I&apos;m doubtful it explains much of anything, let alone the<br/>&gt; structure of atonal music.</p><p>&quot;Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory&quot; (Joseth N. Straus, 1990) is perhaps more interesting as an introductory text, because it is didactic and more rich in musical examples. There are newer concepts not addressed by Forte&apos;s book, and interesting analysis of dodecaphonic pieces. However several concepts and data provided by Forte are not aborded.</p><p>Forte is much more abstract and essentially uses short musical examples to ilustrate the concepts. The second part of Forte&apos;s book contains larger examples (including reductions of a few complete pieces), addressing the presentation of the concept of &quot;set complexes&quot;, going far from the musical surface. He avoids exaggerated &quot;claims&quot;, but there are questionable concepts (for instance, his assumption that his similarity relation &quot;R1&quot; is closer than &quot;R2&quot;; I find it is just more restrictive). The musical examples (from Stravinsky, Ives, Scriabin, Schoenberg, Webern, Berg, Bart&oacute;k, Busoni and others) indicate that there was extensible previous research and analysis of several works.</p><p>A more recent book I have about that is &quot;Teoria anal&iacute;tica da m&uacute;sica do s&eacute;culo XX&quot;, by the portuguese composer Jo&atilde;o Pedro Paiva de Oliveira, published in 2007. Only the most directly relevant concepts are presented, as it is written by a composer point of view rather that by  an analyst (analysts tend to abstraction and to overestimate secundary findings -- that may be just coincidences in most cases!). His analysises of dodecaphonic serieses and its applications in music by Schoenberg, Berg and Webern are very interesting.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; We&apos;ve developed techniques to find optimal tunings given the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; commas that &apos;vanish&apos; in the score.  We can also do things like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; remap 4:5:6 to any other consonant triad like 5:7:9.  The<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; results may not sound good, but they&apos;ll sound better than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; simply remapping chromatically to a scale containing 5:7:9<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chords.  And Erv Wilson and Marcus Hobbs have worked out some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; other very interesting transformations...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Interesting.

It seems that the problem is the (un)stability of the scale, due to the tempering of the fifths, along with some lack of familiarity with the tuning.

A circular temperament with 12-tones (and with better triads than 12-EDO and 19-EDO) would work better  -- at the suitable keys, of course.</p></div><h3><a id=86054 href="#86054">ðŸ”—</a>hfmlacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2010 9:37:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hfmlacerda&quot; &lt;hfmlacerda@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Two interesting texts that address the issue of the perception<br/>&gt; &gt; of similarity between pitch-class sets:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ian Cross<br/>&gt; &gt; Cognitive science and music analaysis - the case of musical pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/~ic108/PDF/CogSciMus.pdf">http://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/~ic108/PDF/CogSciMus.pdf</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Tuire Kuusi<br/>&gt; &gt; Set-Class and Chord: Examining Connection between Theoretical<br/>&gt; &gt; Resemblance and Perceived Closeness<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://ethesis.siba.fi/ethesis/files/isbn9525531007.pdf">http://ethesis.siba.fi/ethesis/files/isbn9525531007.pdf</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; pp 33-38 (in the PDF) are perfectly consistent with what<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve said.

I have restrictions also for the practical test design. It is interesting that it presents the definitions of many proposed similarity relations. The other paper also refers to several experiments, including one that concluded that musicians can compare interval content (of a pair of chords) when other comparation elements (such as common tones) are missing.</p><p>I have concluded that the main difficulty of any comparisons of pitch-class sets is that they try to compare abstract features -- these features are better undertood as representing _potential_ relations between actual sets. The qualitative correspondences of these features (in hearing level) only are evident when involving special sets -- thus it is important to compare every set-class with all other set-classes available in the universe.</p><p>Many sets do not have distinctive features for the perception -- but there are set theory operations which can find these special sets, and to evaluate how special they are. I think these can be useful tools to analyse pitch sets of microtonal scales (ETs).</p><p>For example, Forte&apos;s relation R0 (totally different interval vectors) could find special pentacords in 12-EDO which are dissimilar to each other, including these transitive triples:</p><p>5-2, 5-20, 5-33:<br/>  5-2:  {0,1,2,3,5} &lt;332110&gt;<br/>  5-20: {0,1,3,7,8} &lt;211231&gt;<br/>  5-33: {0,2,4,6,8} &lt;040402&gt;</p><p>5-13, 5-23, 5-33:<br/>  5-13: {0,1,2,4,8} &lt;221311&gt;<br/>  5-23: {0,2,3,5,7} &lt;132130&gt;<br/>  5-33: {0,2,4,6,8} &lt;040402&gt;</p><p>Note that it is easy to associate, in each triple, the first set to &quot;quasi-cluster&quot; chromaticism, the second one to diatonism, and the last set to the whole-tone scale (6-EDO).</p><p>I find that sets showing a proportionally large number of some interval class are easier to group as similar or qualitatively related (for perception). (This strategy may fail with tunings which intervals are not familiar, but this assumption deserves to be tested; there may be at least a small number of exceptional sets.)</p></div><h3><a id=86056 href="#86056">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/6/2010 11:44:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hfmlacerda&quot; &lt;hfmlacerda@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Some points:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; * If you take your chord 4:5:6:7:9:11:13 and permutate the<br/>&gt; pitches in the pitch range, you can easily get sonorities that<br/>&gt; does not resemble too much the original disposition, just<br/>&gt; moving the pitches across octaves.</p><p>Yes, absolutely.  Which is why the canonical version of<br/>regular mapping does little to privilege octaves.  They<br/>have harmonic distance log(2) vs. log(3) for perfect 12ths,<br/>log(6) for a perfect 5th, and so on.</p><p>&gt; * Similarity relations between pitch sets are difficult to<br/>&gt; define and classify. Several year ago I was tempted to explore<br/>&gt; such possibilities (considering pitch range, register,<br/>&gt; disposition, not reducing pitches to pitch classes, etc.), and<br/>&gt; gave up because the untractable large number of possible<br/>&gt; combinations. If you reduce the number of objects to analyse<br/>&gt; (e.g. consonant chords built on 5-limit intervals), you can do<br/>&gt; a refined job; otherwise, as in atonal music, drastical<br/>&gt; reduction may be justified, given the large amount, complexity<br/>&gt; and variety of the pitch combinations which are used.<br/>&gt; &quot;Set theory&quot; is not generally about similarity, but essentially<br/>&gt; about structural (intervalar) properties of sets, as they are<br/>&gt; supposed to be used in atonal composition, or as they are found<br/>&gt; in analysis.</p><p>It seems to me you reached the right conclusion in your<br/>investigation, and that set theory has no answer for it.<br/>Set theory uses and combines relations anyway.  Again, here<br/>is the distinction between set theory as a generative method<br/>(which is fine) and an analytical one (which means it must<br/>meet the standards of a scientific theory).</p><p>&gt;you only can have an exact transposition of a chord using<br/>&gt;transposition related sets, by definition;</p><p>This definition is true but that does not mean anything else<br/>about sets is relevant to music.</p><p>&gt; * If the universe is 12-EDO, according to Forte, _every_<br/>&gt; pc set with n=5 or n=7 elements can hold a subset with n-1<br/>&gt; elements invariant under inversion,</p><p>Can you give an example?</p><p>&gt; * The interval vector resumes important relations (in special<br/>&gt; the number of common tones between a set and its transposition<br/>&gt; to every interval class), which are shared by sets with equal<br/>&gt; interval vectors (transpositions, inversions ans &quot;Z-related&quot;<br/>&gt; sets); whether these sets can or cannot be presented so that<br/>&gt; they sound &quot;similar&quot; is another issue: basically they share a<br/>&gt; common quantitative feature, from which can be extracted<br/>&gt; potential usages and other conclusions.</p><p>This sounds generative.</p><p>&gt; For example, Forte have found that _any_ 5-tone subsets of<br/>&gt; 12-EDO contain at least one M3 (or m6) -- therefore, a major<br/>&gt; third as subset is of null relevance as distinctive feature<br/>&gt; of a given pentachord; you need at least 2 M3 to make a<br/>&gt; difference.</p><p>If such an observation is to be useful in analysis, we must<br/>assume something like 1. the music to be analyzed was generated<br/>in 12-ET and 2. the composer is presenting us a pentachord, in<br/>such a way that we may identify it from all possible pentachords<br/>using facts about pentachords in 12-ET.  In other words, it&apos;s<br/>useful if the music was composed using set theory!</p><p>&gt;... you can hold a fixed M3 and superpose to it a succession<br/>&gt;of different 3-tone chords, eventually presenting every<br/>&gt;possible 5-tone chord type with no repetition.)</p><p>Generative (though interesting!)</p><p>&gt;If the interval vector of a set shows a lot of M2s, or a lot<br/>&gt;of P4s, one can have some idea of how it may sound, etc. Just<br/>&gt;don&apos;t ask the interval vector more than it can answer, and you<br/>&gt;can find it useful. (You can surely imagine: there is a lot of<br/>&gt;delirious &quot;extensions&quot; and &quot;applications&quot; to this &quot;set theory&quot;<br/>&gt;around) :-)</p><p>Yes, very many.  We are talking about z-relations on interval<br/>vectors a few paragraphs ago!</p><p>&gt; * To be clear: I don&apos;t consider &quot;pitch-class set theory&quot; as<br/>&gt; a &quot;theory&quot;; of course it cannot be called a &quot;music theory&quot;</p><p>Well ok!

You haven&apos;t even listened to all of his<br/>works, yet have the temerity to pass harsh--but in fact highly<br/>clich&eacute;d--judgments on his later music (which isn&apos;t in all cases my favorite,<br/>either, but not because it is &quot;atonal&quot;). I suspect that if you were<br/>to discover that you were wrong concerning Schoenberg&apos;s influence, you would<br/>accuse the authors of the articles of being sterile academics, or something of<br/>the sort. And you have continued to speak of Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&quot;atonality,&quot; although Schoenberg clearly and distinctly distanced<br/>himself from this term, which he thought was nonsensical (he favored<br/>&quot;pantonal&quot;). &nbsp;I&apos;ll just talk briefly about set theory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you had responded to<br/>my note by saying that there is a low degree of predictability in set theory, I<br/>probably would have agreed with you, and we might have gotten somewhere. But<br/>claiming that there is a zero degree of predictability is plain wrong. I&apos;ve<br/>been composing using elements of set theory for the last twenty-odd years, and<br/>I can very clearly hear a large number of sets. I can hear these sets, often<br/>without looking at a score, in the elegantly constructed music of Elliott<br/>Carter (who, by the way, independently catalogued all of the sets in Forte&apos;s<br/>book years before Forte&apos;s book came out and has used these sets for the last<br/>half century. One of your claims in another post implies that set theory was<br/>concurrent with Schoenberg&apos;s atonal compositions, but this is simply wrong;&nbsp;Haimo<br/>has demonstrated on the basis of Schoenberg&apos;s manuscripts that it is unlikely<br/>that Schoenberg was thinking in terms of any of the larger sets and<br/>set-relations Forte uses to analyze Schoenberg&apos;s music; this is not a<br/>scientific disproof of Forte&apos;s theory, but a historical proof of the<br/>unreliability of Forte&apos;s assertions.). &nbsp;My sophomore students learn to<br/>identify the main sets by ear. &nbsp;Thousands of students have learned these<br/>skills. Whatever you think about the theory, you can&apos;t just throw out demonstrably<br/>incorrect statements about it and expect to be taken seriously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I agree with you that<br/>set theory is not a useful analytical theory, but for very different reasons<br/>than you offer. You claim that an analytic theory &quot;must&nbsp;meet the standards of a scientific<br/>theory,&quot; but this is precisely where practically all post-WWII<br/>American-influenced analytic methods have started to go wrong. An analytic<br/>theory cannot meet the standards of a scientific theory, because musical<br/>analysis is not a science. &nbsp;One can apply scientific methods to a<br/>description of aural data, but aural data is not in itself music; once it is<br/>considered an artwork, the mode of analysis has to change. &nbsp;Although music<br/>analyses tend to use a common language (or at the least dialects--Riemann vs.<br/>Roman numeral analysis, etc.--that can be translated one into another with<br/>relatively little loss of meaning), their value as analyses is not judged<br/>solely on whether it can be proven that they use this language<br/>&quot;correctly&quot;; the ability to use a common language coherently is<br/>merely the condition for considering the author to be professionally competent.<br/>What distinguishes great from mediocre analyses is always the personal<br/>element--the insight that a great musician offers, the explanatory power of an<br/>original approach, and so forth. &nbsp;Schumann&apos;s analysis of Berlioz&apos;s<br/>Symphonie Fantastique will continue to be treated as a classic, even though he<br/>got elements of the form &quot;wrong&quot; (according to modern theories) and<br/>had a primitive analytical terminology, simply because Schumann was a great<br/>musician, a fine writer, and a great composer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Theories like<br/>Forte&apos;s are, I believe, very weak as analytic theories (although, as I<br/>mentioned earlier, the labeling system is useful, as are a few of the tools<br/>described early on in the book) because they claim a scientific validity that<br/>is not justified. &nbsp;This is the pseudo-scientific element that constantly<br/>creeps into American-influenced academic theory. &nbsp;This is largely because<br/>American academic institutions tend to judge all disciplines by the standards<br/>of science; because the arts and other disciplines can&apos;t meet these standards,<br/>pseudo-scientific and reductionist methods are the ones that tend to prosper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To answer your<br/>charge, no, I am not pushing any sort of scientific relativism, whatever you<br/>may mean by this (I am not sure, however, that you have kept up on the last<br/>fifty years of theories of science--are you claiming, with Aristotle, that<br/>science is &quot;certain knowledge&quot;?). &nbsp;I am opposed to pseudo-science,<br/>especially when it invades musical analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to kick<br/>me off this tuning list for not agreeing with&nbsp; you, that&apos;s fine with me.&nbsp; At least it will be clear what the purpose of this list is<br/>in your eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Franklin</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tuesday,<br/>January 26, 2010 3:20 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From:</p><p>&quot;Carl<br/>Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt;</p><p>Add sender<br/>to Contacts</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To:</p><p><a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>--- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, Cox Franklin &lt;franklincox@ ...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Carl,</p><p>&gt; You&apos;re<br/>the one who lumped atonalists together with serialists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The<br/>terminology isn&apos;t standardized.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&gt;<br/>Stravinsky was strongly influenced by Schoenberg, as was</p><p>&gt; Milhaud.<br/>In fact, practically every major composer in this</p><p>&gt; period<br/>responded to the challenge of Schoenberg&apos;s music and</p><p>&gt; ideas;<br/>even if they didn&apos;t like the music, they took the</p><p>&gt; challenge<br/>seriously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My cat was<br/>also influenced by Schoenberg.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&gt; So it<br/>appears you have a Hegelian theory of music in which</p><p>&gt; history<br/>is a one-way train progressing from outmoded</p><p>&gt; forms<br/>(Western art music) to the new dominant form, American</p><p>&gt; popular<br/>music.

There are correspondences, therefore they are relevant.</p><p>Here I should make a comparison: there is a book which explains tonal harmony using set theory (it is absolutely not related to Babbitt/Forte/etc. works). A reasonable number of tonal relations can be represented that way, whereas many other are not aborded. That approach is not very useful, though, specially because _there are_ other expositive systems which are efficient (Schoenberg&apos;s book is very good).</p><p>For atonal music analysis, there are traditional analytical tools, usually involving tables of pitch collections and schematic representations. But I have no notice of any standardized analytical procedure (this is not a problem, provided that the analyst is competent). &quot;Set theory&quot; presented a representation of most of the traditional operations using numbers, and explored 12-EDO further, contributing with new concepts. Probably, the most important contribution was simply the classification of pc-sets -- the Forte&apos;s list itself -- because as sets can be identified, providing a vocabulary (set names and prime forms). AFAIK, &quot;set theory&quot; was (or is?) like an USA-made fashion, not very welcome by European musicians/analysts for some time.

In other words, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; useful if the music was composed using set theory!</p><p>Atonal music typically used all the 12 tones of 12-EDO in a short time span. Thus, the way the tones are combined is the relevant thing. What identifies a set is the fact that the tones are selected and combined as to form that specific set (when it is presented as chord, a for example).</p><p>When Forte compares penthachords, he is not just comparing it with every other pentachord in 12-EDO, but also considering its relevance and relative frequency in the vocabulary of atonal music. Virtually every pc set is used in this repertory, thus the comparison with every other pentachord of 12-EDO can be justified by the actual practice. Atonal music is rather different of tonal music, in which a small number of set types prevail.</p><p>The example above is just an objective conclusion of the possibilities, showing that an analist must be aware of the combinatorial possibilities in 12-EDO in order to evaluate the relevance of a relation found in a music piece.</p><p>[...]<br/>&gt; &gt;If the interval vector of a set shows a lot of M2s, or a lot<br/>&gt; &gt;of P4s, one can have some idea of how it may sound, etc. Just<br/>&gt; &gt;don&apos;t ask the interval vector more than it can answer, and you<br/>&gt; &gt;can find it useful.

I<br/>openly admit I know next to nothing about music set theory,<br/>and am very grateful to Hudson for explaining what he has.<br/>Note however, he just admitted that set theory is not a<br/>scientific music theory.  And I imagine I know more about<br/>set theory than you know about regular temperaments.</p><p>I&apos;m completely confident of my position that the great<br/>neoclassical works of Stravinsky, Prokofiev and others owe<br/>nothing to combinatorial techniques.  This means there is no<br/>model explaining why combinatorial techniques produce<br/>enjoyable music to which great neoclassical works conform.<br/>NOT that Stravinsky (or better yet, Mozart) didn&apos;t use tone<br/>rows here or there.  As far as finding sets in Schoenberg,<br/>you must also disprove the null hypothesis -- that average<br/>serial (but not deliberately set-based) music would contain<br/>them.

Do you really think tenured professors worry at all what you think about them? If you want to make your point heard anywhere outside of your closed circle, the onus is on you to prove that all of these professors are wrong.&nbsp; You are welcome to submit papers to peer-review journals proving that all of the work submitted to these journals is of no value.&nbsp; But until you master the&nbsp; discourse, nobody is going to take your assertions seriously.</p><p>And until you learn a bit more about the composers you&apos;re talking about, I have trouble knowing what to make of much of what you say about modern music.&nbsp; Whatever arguments you and your circle make must adhere to the historical evidence.&nbsp; Stravinsky knew Schoenberg&apos;s music early on and was directly influenced by it in the period between Petroushka and the Rite; haven&apos;t you noticed the dramatic increase in dissonance in the latter work?&nbsp; Stravinsky also used permutational methods throughout his Neoclassical period, hidden canons, cellular construction, and the like, throughout his Neoclassical period, even though the music was centered in keys.&nbsp; In the late 1940&apos;s his procedures grew progressively closer to serial procedures.&nbsp; Perhaps you&apos;ve forgotten that he wrote serial music for the last two decades of his life.&nbsp; He studied the scores of Berg, Schoenberg, and Webern closely, as well as those of Stockhausen, Boulez, Babbitt et al. The composer he<br/> regarded the most highly of all the post-war group was Elliott Carter (who has never been a serialist, by the way---this is a common misunderstanding).</p><p>Milhaud knew and admired Schoenberg greatly and wrote about the impact of Pierrot on him.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you mean by &quot;combinatorial techniques&quot;?&nbsp; Do you mean the type of combinatoriality used by Schoenberg in his 12-tone works? Or do you mean compositional procedures using set classes?&nbsp; There&apos;s a specific meaning to &quot;combinatorial&quot; in 12-tone theory.</p><p>I never claimed to know as much about regular temperaments as you.&nbsp; The problem I have is that it seems to me that you are claiming to know a lot more about certain subjects than you actually do. I will also concede your superior knowledge in scientific methods, although you will find plenty of disagreement among leading theorists to your assertion concerning Bayesian inference.</p><p>I never dismissed the work you&apos;ve dedicated yourself to; I don&apos;t know much about it, but I&apos;m happy that there are lots of different approaches out there.&nbsp; However, you dismissed the sort of music that I&apos;ve been doing for the last three decades without knowing anything about it.&nbsp; Maybe you did composer &quot;atonal&quot; music &quot;when you were 19,&quot; as you say, but I doubt that you achieved anything of great subtlety and accomplishment in this field.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m supposed to prove to you; I&apos;m not looking to you or anyone else in the tuning list for validation. I joined the list because I was hoping that some people in this circle might be interested in the Ben Johnston colloquium I&apos;m organizing.&nbsp; I got involved in this whole discussion because I read the same sort of pseudo-scientific blanket dismissals of &quot;dissonant,&quot; &quot;atonal&quot; music that keep popping up everywhere. I responded to your post because you were condemning one genre after another--including the one in which I and hundreds of other composers are working--to obsolescence.&nbsp; These sorts of statements are harmful and lead nowhere except into childish disputes.&nbsp; You keep asserting that you have proof that a lot of &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot; field of work is baloney, but you don&apos;t provide any specific examples, and I don&apos;t see any evidence that you&apos;ve proven anything.&nbsp;</p><p>You can prove anything you like to yourself, but the validity in the real world is the acceptance of that proof by the people involved. If you want your proof to mean anything outside of your circle, you&apos;re going to have to convince other people outside of your circle.<br/>Until you do that, I and hundreds of other composers will continue practicing the craft to which we&apos;ve devoted our lives.</p><p>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Mon, 2/8/10, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:carl@lumma.org">carl@lumma.org</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Musical Set Theory in 12-tET<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Monday, February 8, 2010, 12:35 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      Hi Franklin,</p><p>The onus is on proponents of music set theory / serialism &amp;</p><p>related disciplines to show something capable of delivering</p><p>on claims made, results supposedly obtained, and doctorates</p><p>granted.

He&apos;s been called to task for his misrepresentations in the scholarly literature.&nbsp;</p><p>I&apos;ll give you an idea of his approach; about twenty years ago when he was attacking Babbitt and Martino, I wrote to him and defended them--not because I necessarily love their music, but because I found Taruskin&apos;s methods shoddy.&nbsp; Bear in mind that Taruskin had toed the party line for years, using Babbitt as the representative of contemporary American composition in Introduction to Music courses. When I taught under him at Columbia University, I suggested including Steve Reich in the course, but that was too anti-establishment a notion for him. A few years later, the leopard had changed his spots; suddently Reich was the greatest American composer of all and Babbitt a useless old composer whose music was based on demonstrably false premises.&nbsp; Of course Taruskin is free to worship Reich (who&apos;s music is pretty and charming but pretty thin), but the nasty tone and the pseudo-scientism were galling, and the wholesale condemnation of an accomplished<br/> composer&apos;s entire career I found unseemly.</p><p>Taruskin started peppering me with nasty little notes, as he has done to countless others&nbsp; who have challenged him. I pointed out to him that numerous younger composers--Roger Redgate, Richard Barrett, Marc Andre, Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf, and so forth--were pushing the boundaries in quite different ways than Babbitt, and were not using total serial methods.&nbsp; His response: &quot;I don&apos;t know any of your friends.&quot; In other words, a supposed authority on modern music simply didn&apos;t want to know what he didn&apos;t want to know.&nbsp; A few years later, he wrote his mammoth opus, and he continued to wage war against the generation preceding him, with not a sign that he had expanded his knowledge to deal with unusual composers of the younger generation. In other words, the entire history&nbsp; of modern music ends where his interests end.&nbsp; This is lousy scholarship. Bear in mind that this is not &quot;Taruskin&apos;s History of Western Music,&quot; but the Oxford History of Western Music, a<br/> work&nbsp; whose title lays claims to a degree of reliability and impartiality of which Taruskin is wholly incapable.&nbsp; Regarding modern music, his entire concern is with&nbsp; previous generations, and I find it his approach tedious and tendentious. I&apos;m fairly confident that in a few years, once he&apos;s not around to threaten people, the gloss will come off his reputation.&nbsp; He can be pretty shaky as a traditional historian as well. His book on Stravinsky was quite wonderful, though.</p><p>There&apos;s a lot of wonderful music out there; modern music didn&apos;t end with Xenakis and friends. I&apos;m co-editing a series--New Music and Aesthetics in the 21st Century (Wolke Verlag)--that focuses on younger composers, and am co-editing a journal, Search, which has a similar focus (a compilation of the first year&apos;s writings will be coming out soon from Mellen Press).&nbsp; There&apos;s been a serious gap in coverage of adventurous composers, and most people are still fixated on the serialists vs. non-serialists issue, which is decades past its prime.&nbsp;</p><p>regards,</p><p>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Mon, 2/8/10, Dante Rosati &lt;danterosati@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Dante Rosati &lt;<a href="mailto:danterosati@gmail.com">danterosati@gmail.com</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Musical Set Theory in 12-tET<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Monday, February 8, 2010, 5:42 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      the way I look at it is that there are some ideas in music which are interesting and worth exploring briefly but which exhaust their possibilities rather quickly.

It turns out that Taruskin didn&apos;t know much about Martino&apos;s music; in fact over half of<br/> Martino&apos;s music is high-quality tonal music.&nbsp; Taruskin&apos;s entire argument is taken from Boulez, who made excessive claims about the necessity of writing serial music, claims which have nothing to do with Martino.&nbsp; Neverthelss, Taruskin applied them to Martino.&nbsp; The whole presentation was fraudulent, attributing views to a composer that the composer has never held, assuming the composer was a diehard serialist when the composer was not a diehard serialist, and so forth. In other words, a bit of scholarship strips the performance down to a few shoddy tricks on the part of the ciritic.&nbsp;</p><p>I&apos;m always willing to concede the weakness of pitch-class theory; in fact, I jokingly advise my students to find a book, cut out about twenty pages, and ditch the rest.&nbsp; However, the &quot;it&apos;s *all* bullshit&quot; argument tends to discredit the person upholding it, because the attack collapses&nbsp; if a single bit of evidence can be found that would<br/> demonstrate that the value of the theory. And because many fine composers and theorists use aspects of pitch class theory, the evidence is not hard to find. So the attacker either has to deny evidence in order to uphold his or her claim, or make a more subtle and reasonable argument based on the full range of evidence out there.</p><p>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@ <a href="http://yahoo.com">yahoo.com</a></p><p>--- On Mon, 2/8/10, Dante Rosati &lt;danterosati@ <a href="http://gmail.com">gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Dante Rosati &lt;danterosati@ <a href="http://gmail.com">gmail.com</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Musical Set Theory in 12-tET</p><p>To: tuning@yahoogroups. com<br/>Date: Monday, February 8, 2010, 4:20 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      &gt; But until you master the&nbsp; discourse, nobody is going to take your assertions seriously.</p><p>Taruskin learned all that stuff so that when he claims its all</p><p>bullshit no one can say he doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;s talking about.</p></div><h3><a id=86074 href="#86074">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2010 12:09:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Cox Franklin &lt;franklincox@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; If the proponents of set theory don&apos;t meet your demand, are<br/>&gt; you going to walk into each university and force them to fire<br/>&gt; the professors of set theory?&nbsp; As little as I like elements of<br/>&gt; the theory, there it&apos;s established in the academic discourse,<br/>&gt; and no matter how much you complain about it, it&apos;s not leaving<br/>&gt; any time soon.

Find the JI tetrad to which the target chord has the<br/>smallest error (choose the more consonant tetrad in case of<br/>a tie).

(The comparison of those 4 chords provided a point for further exploration which I think can be very interesting.)</p><p>[...]<br/>&gt; What do you make of this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.mta.ca/faculty/arts-letters/music/pc-set_project/pc-set_new/pages/introduction/toc.html">http://www.mta.ca/faculty/arts-letters/music/pc-set_project/pc-set_new/pages/introduction/toc.html</a></p><p>It is a very concise introduction to the basic concepts, in the style of J.N.Straus book, but with only a few musical examples. It seems to be based on Straus&apos; book contents.</p><p>(There you can find, BTW, that exaggerated assumption of similarity based on Z-relation. I can provide an analysis of the most famous pair of Z-related sets showing interesting &quot;oppositions&quot; between then.)</p><p>See also Solomon&apos;s site:<br/><a href="http://solomonsmusic.net/setheory.htm">http://solomonsmusic.net/setheory.htm</a><br/><a href="http://solomonsmusic.net/">http://solomonsmusic.net/</a><br/>He also provides a software for pitch class sets analysis (I guess it is &quot;unfortunately&quot; restrict to 12-EDO).<br/><a href="http://solomonsmusic.net/mas.htm">http://solomonsmusic.net/mas.htm</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How about comparing those other sets (as subsets of 12-EDO)?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A={C,Eb,G,Bb}<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; B={D,Eb,G#,A}<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C={C,E,G,B}<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; D={B,C,F,Bb}<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I played the pitches in ascending order starting as close<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to middle C as possible.  I tried notes simultaneously and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; arpeggiated.  I observed that A and C are more consonant<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; than B or D, as would be predicted by psychoacoustics and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; normal music theory.  D was most dissonant.  Other than<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that, I heard no significant attributes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How can these dissonance predictions be made using &quot;normal<br/>&gt; &gt; music theory&quot;? And/or: is there a simplified way to use<br/>&gt; &gt; psychoacoustic principles to compare those chords?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Normal music theory explains consonant chords as being made<br/>&gt; of 3rds.  Minor 2nds are explicitly dissonant, and Maj7 &amp;<br/>&gt; min7 tetrads are explicitly consonant.</p><p>That (rather simplified description) seems to be in conflict with the old practice which requires special treatment of 7ths. This also ignores that the dim and dim7 chords -- made of 3rds! -- were traditionally considered as dissonant. And you have omitted the P5, which is important.</p><p>Nonetheless, you referred to the intervals that constitute a chord, and its interval structure. Here are the respective interval vectors of the chords (analysed as pitch-class sets).</p><p>interval class    1  2  3  4  5  6<br/>                 m2 M2 m3 M3 P4 A4<br/> A={C,Eb,G,Bb}  &lt; 0  1  2  1  2  0 &gt;<br/> B={D,Eb,G#,A}  &lt; 2  0  0  0  2  2 &gt;<br/> C={C,E,G,B}    &lt; 1  0  1  2  2  0 &gt;<br/> D={B,C,F,Bb}   &lt; 2  1  0  0  2  1 &gt;</p><p>From it one can deduce that A and C are likely more consonant than B and D, assuming, that intervals of the classes of m2, M2 and A4 are more dissonant than intervals of the classes of m3, M3 and P4. All the 4 chords have 2 intervals of class 5 (P4) -- thus we compare only the remaining consonant classes (3 and 4) against the dissonant ones (1, 2 and 6), and find that B and D are more dissonant than A and C, since they do not contain these consonant intervals, but only the dissonant ones. It is, of course, a rough estimative (since, to cite only one problem, it ignores the difference between m2 and M7), but it works within its large error margin -- it might be useful to find set types near the extreme cases.</p><p>Further comparison is not possible for consonance/dissonance from this simplified model (Krenek/Hindemith would propose a slightly finer dissonance classification). One could analyse the chords as pitch sets, rather than pitch-class sets, thus considering the difference between m2 and M7, and pitch register, assuming psychoacoustical properties of the intervals in the tuning (12-EDO in this example).</p><p>For analytical ears, the presence of only 3 interval classes is significant (in special the 2 tritones, in the comparison above) for the identification of this remarkable set, very often used in atonal music.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for the psychoacoustics approach, we have two options:<br/>&gt; 1. Error from just intonation<br/>&gt; 2. Harmonic entropy<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Option 1 goes like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1a. List all tetrads, expressed w:x:y:z where each term is an<br/>&gt; integer and GCD(w,x,y,z) = 1, such that the product w*x*y*z<br/>&gt; is &lt; some cutoff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1b. Compute each tetrad&apos;s consonance by geomean(w,x,y,z).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1c. Target chord {W,X,Y,Z} where each term is a real number<br/>&gt; representing a frequency ratio above some 1.0, has error<br/>&gt;     max(<br/>&gt;         |log(X/W) - log(x/w)| / log(x*w&apos;)<br/>&gt;         |log(Y/W) - log(y/w)| / log(y*w&apos;)<br/>&gt;         |log(Y/X) - log(y/x)| / log(y*x&apos;)<br/>&gt;         etc.<br/>&gt;     )<br/>&gt; to each JI tetrad, where x*w&apos; is x*w when x/w is in lowest<br/>&gt; terms.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1d. Find the JI tetrad to which the target chord has the<br/>&gt; smallest error (choose the more consonant tetrad in case of<br/>&gt; a tie).  Target chord is said to &quot;approximate&quot; this chord and<br/>&gt; shares its consonance rating when the error is small.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1e. This approach fails somewhat for so-called &quot;magic&quot; chords<br/>&gt; like the dim7 in 12-ET, which, it can be argued, have no true<br/>&gt; origin in just intonation.</p><p>It would be very interesting to compare pitch sets in equal temperaments using this approach, and then classify them in pitch-class sets, and look for pitch-class sets which error is maximum or minimum -- that is: which pitch-class sets are more resistent or weak to pitch/interval disposition along the octave registers.</p><p>That analysis could be tested in several equal temperaments.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Option 2 goes like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2a. Get Microsoft Excel.<br/>&gt; 2b. Get this spreadsheet:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/music/theory/DyadicHarmonicEntropyCalc.xls">http://lumma.org/music/theory/DyadicHarmonicEntropyCalc.xls</a><br/>&gt; 2c. Plug in the cents values for the target chord.<br/>&gt; 2d. Get the result.<br/>&gt; 2e. This is sum of dyadic entropies, whereas what we really<br/>&gt; want is tetradic entropy directly.  Unfortunately it is an<br/>&gt; open problem to compute tetradic harmonic entropy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>Is there any other implementation, or a detailed description of the algorithm? I cannot use spreadsheets, and I am not sure they can be used on a large number of 12-EDO subsets.</p><p>Otherwise, if you can do it, would you compare all chords inside the range of 2 octaves?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Hudson</p></div><h3><a id=86083 href="#86083">ðŸ”—</a>Dante Rosati &#x3C;danterosati@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2010 8:11:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Franklin-</p><p>I agree that the title of the books should be &quot;Taruskin&apos;s History of<br/>Western Music&quot;, and he clearly explains in the intro that it does not<br/>pretend to be a 5vol Grout.

I have emphasized this aspect, since it may of interest of microtonal composers.</p><p>&gt; or for analyzing atonal music (not other forms).</p><p>Correct.</p><p>&gt;  And you&apos;ve said<br/>&gt; it doesn&apos;t matter if the relations are audible.</p><p>No, I have not said that. The relations are not always necessarily on the musical surface (easy to identify by ear), but one cannot say they don&apos;t exist.</p><p>You have read that Franklin can identify set-classes by ear. I don&apos;t claim I have so a skilled capability, but I also can do it to a limited extent. The same for 19th-century harmony: not always I can follow remote modulations or chord relations by ear, but I know by experience that my ability for that is greatly improved when I am listening that kind of music with certain frequency. Identifying certain interval relations in Webern&apos;s music demand concentration, for me, but most basic relations are on the surface, since Webern explores redundance and uses mainly small sets as basic material. There are also people able to listen to an atonal work once and then speak about it, playing passages on a piano etc.</p><p>Most atonal music (Schoenberg in special) are too much _complex_ for most of us -- thus, many of the ideas present may be not perceived for most listeners, even when reading an analysis; but other listeners can perceive those relations.</p><p>Furthermore, many constructive relations may be not evident, but can make the music sound organized or at least sound stylistically consistent. They have a, to say, indirect effect on the music. That is my experience with Boulez&apos;s harmony, which I find refined and tasteful.</p><p>We can test the range of vality and usefulness of set relations, provided they are not discarded sumarily. One can listen to, study and analyse atonal music, and read analysis of pieces (using different approaches, including pc-set-based) and reach conclusions.</p><p>I am pretty ready to completely abandon pitch-class set approach in favour of other analytical procedures, if I find they can replace it with advantages.</p><p>Unfortunately, I could not yet find that approach, and your position against pitch-class sets -- which is based on pratically null experience with atonal music and approaches to analyse it, as you assumed -- cannot change anything. I am usually skeptical (in several levels, from interpersonal relations to agnostic atheism), and this reflets also on &quot;set theory&quot;, which I have questioned since my very first reading of Forte&apos;s book a dozen years ago; but there is a practical limit for skepticism or scientific rigour -- in this case, I repeat: an imperfect tool is better than no tool at all. Franklin and I both affirm that Forte&apos;s theory has flaws, but also has useful contributions. But you seems to suggest that none is better.</p><p>As scientific standards are so important to you (although you repeatedly claimed the historical absurd of Viennese atonal music being based on pitch-class set theory, what is plain wrong, as if Isaac was influenced by Webern or Bach by Schenker): the eventual replacement of a more limited scientific theory for a more efficient is normal in science, just like false concepts can be replaced with correct ones.</p><p>Of course, as it is presumable, there is absolutely no barrier against someone (me?) study regular mapping etc. and apply the resulting knowledge to atonal music, bringing out a marvellous theory of the pitch organization in atonal music. Even if someone eventually do that, this does not justify the abandon of pitch-class sets tools until there.</p><p>[...]<br/>&gt; You have Franklin<br/>&gt; saying that set theory explains neoclassicism.</p><p>Where?</p><p>(At least, one can understand neoclassicism as a reference to Schoenberg&apos;s dodecaphonic music.) :-)</p><p>&gt;  Tell me<br/>&gt; where to draw the line.</p><p>Well, my references on pitch-class set theory are essentially Forte, Straus and Jo&atilde;o Pedro Paiva de Oliveira, and all them focus atonal music (and dodecaphonic music, except Forte).</p><p>I have read also a few articles on compositional ideas based on pitch-class, but they are not too relevant.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regular mapping starts with psychoacoustics, which is an<br/>&gt; experimental science.  We find it supports many rules of<br/>&gt; common-practice theory.  That&apos;s interesting.</p><p>Indeed it is interesting.</p><p>&gt;  With regular<br/>&gt; mapping we can derive the diatonic scale purely from the<br/>&gt; consonances/note consideration, along with other scales we<br/>&gt; predict should behave similarly.  And it obviously works:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/decatonic-swing.mp3">http://lumma.org/tuning/erlich/decatonic-swing.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is in 22, using the pajara scales I just recommended<br/>&gt; to Mike.</p><p>Very very very nice. :-D</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; We can also find tunings ideal for atonality</p><p>That would be interesting, if it was be tried.</p><p>&gt; and probably<br/>&gt; even measure the tonality in a piece (I expect, proportional<br/>&gt; to the average harmonic entropy of its simultaneities, and<br/>&gt; inversely proportional to the standard deviation).</p><p>That is also interesting.</p><p>Just for curiosity: was that tested in pieces based on extended tonality (using wandering and remote chords etc.)? (Neo-old might be an example, or some passages from Schoenberg&apos;s Verklaerte Nacht or 1st String Quartet.)</p><p>[...]<br/>&gt; &gt; (There you can find, BTW, that exaggerated assumption of<br/>&gt; &gt; similarity based on Z-relation. I can provide an analysis of<br/>&gt; &gt; the most famous pair of Z-related sets showing interesting<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;oppositions&quot; between then.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Have you published on this?</p><p>That is an observation I have derived reflecting about this debate. I have not written it down.</p><p>( BTW, another example of opposition can be found in Forte&apos;s book: he defined 4 similarity relations, one based on common subsets (intersection), and others based on interval content; there are set-classes of n elements which are minimally similar with respect to interval content, but are very similar with respect to common subsets (intersection with cardinality n-1). )</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; See also Solomon&apos;s site:<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://solomonsmusic.net/setheory.htm">http://solomonsmusic.net/setheory.htm</a><br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://solomonsmusic.net/">http://solomonsmusic.net/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; He also provides a software for pitch class sets analysis<br/>&gt; &gt; (I guess it is &quot;unfortunately&quot; restrict to 12-EDO).<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://solomonsmusic.net/mas.htm">http://solomonsmusic.net/mas.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Looks like a DOS program... a bit outdated.</p><p>It is a DOS program, with a rather limited user interface. But it seems to be working here on my GNU+Linux dosbox.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Nonetheless, you referred to the intervals that constitute<br/>&gt; &gt; a chord, and its interval structure. Here are the respective<br/>&gt; &gt; interval vectors of the chords (analysed as pitch-class sets).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; interval class    1  2  3  4  5  6<br/>&gt; &gt;                  m2 M2 m3 M3 P4 A4<br/>&gt; &gt;  A={C,Eb,G,Bb}  &lt; 0  1  2  1  2  0 &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  B={D,Eb,G#,A}  &lt; 2  0  0  0  2  2 &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  C={C,E,G,B}    &lt; 1  0  1  2  2  0 &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  D={B,C,F,Bb}   &lt; 2  1  0  0  2  1 &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; From it one can deduce that A and C are likely more consonant<br/>&gt; &gt; than B and D, assuming, that intervals of the classes of m2,<br/>&gt; &gt; M2 and A4 are more dissonant than intervals of the classes of<br/>&gt; &gt; m3, M3 and P4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When you get to extended JI, we find that order matters.<br/>&gt; For instance, compare 4:5:6:7:9:11 with its subharmonic<br/>&gt; inverse.</p><p>Agree. That is something one should care when trying to extend pitch-class set theory to other tunings than 12-EDO. Most sets with 6 or more notes work more as scales than as chords.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Option 2 goes like this:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2a. Get Microsoft Excel.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2b.

Plug in the cents values for the target chord.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2d. Get the result.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2e. This is sum of dyadic entropies, whereas what we really<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; want is tetradic entropy directly.  Unfortunately it is an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; open problem to compute tetradic harmonic entropy.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Is there any other implementation, or a detailed description<br/>&gt; &gt; of the algorithm? I cannot use spreadsheets, and I am not sure<br/>&gt; &gt; they can be used on a large number of 12-EDO subsets.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Excel will handle many millions of rows these days.  Anyway<br/>&gt; this is just a lookup table that sums the entropies of the<br/>&gt; dyads in a chord.  The entropy calculation itself has been<br/>&gt; described on the harmonic_entropy list.</p><p>Have you a URL?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Otherwise, if you can do it, would you compare all chords<br/>&gt; &gt; inside the range of 2 octaves?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which chords exactly?</p><p>All possible chord types containing no octaves, with 3 to 5 or 6 pitches, for example.</p></div><h3><a id=86121 href="#86121">ðŸ”—</a>hfmlacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/8/2010 5:25:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Great, Daniel!</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What&apos;s boring on it?

Tetrachords are trickier, because there are a lot more tetrachords and a lot more ways of parsing them.

Or perhaps this is more clear: if the larger set is a symmetrical scale (octatonice, whole tone scale, etc), then perception of it is simple, and larger diatonic sets are easy to identify, as are cluster sets.&nbsp; But perception or more complex hexachords&nbsp; is what I would call liminal--one can identify a subset and, if a composer is consistently using a small number of hexachords, sense that the other notes belong to one of those hexachords.&nbsp; I can often recognize the (012478) hexachord, because I know Elliott Carter&apos;s music well, and he has been using it for decades. I have used the (012568) hexachord for decades, so I know it cold.&nbsp; But I can&apos;t hear<br/> any six-note combination and instantly name the hexachord.&nbsp; But this is probably not that important in most contexts. Carter has always insisted that all of his complex work with sets is only a means, not an end, and he is not very much interested in analyses of his music that focus on this aspect.</p><p>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Tue, 2/9/10, Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Petr Par&iacute;zek &lt;p.parizek@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] Re: Musical Set Theory in 12-tET<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Tuesday, February 9, 2010, 8:53 AM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hudson<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>You have read that Franklin can identify set-classes by<br/>ear.<br/>Although<br/>I probably don&rsquo;t understand the terminology, I&rsquo;d be curious if this is possible<br/>to learn.

Stravinsky&apos;s neoclassicism is generally viewed as &quot;Neoclassicism&quot; per se owing to his tremendous influence. &nbsp;Many view Schoenberg&apos;s turn to the 12-tone method as an answer to Stravinsky&apos;s neoclassical turn; after years composing free-atonal works that were closely allied to mysticism (he planned a mammoth cycle based on Balzac&apos;s Seraphita), suddenly in the 1920&apos;s he began writing pieces called &quot;Suite&quot; and &quot;Serenade&quot;, composed of movements in classical and baroque forms. &nbsp;The 12-tone method was instrumental in this change in focus. &nbsp;My favorite works or Schoenberg&apos;s are actually the free atonal works, although I love the Serenade op. 22 (which has one 12-tone movement and other movements based on 10-note series, etc.).<br/>Also look at some of Stravinsky&apos;s works from the late 1940&apos;s--he is obviously getting very close to serial procedures, &nbsp;A work like Agon moves effortlessly between the non-serial and serial worlds. &nbsp;There was a large change in his &quot;sound&quot; when Stravinsky adopted serialism, but the change had been brewing for some time.<br/>Franklin</p><p>Dr. Franklin Cox</p><p>1107 Xenia Ave.</p><p>Yellow Springs, OH 45387</p><p>(937) 767-1165</p><p>franklincox@...</p><p>--- On Tue, 2/9/10, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:carl@lumma.org">carl@lumma.org</a>&gt;<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Musical Set Theory in 12-tET<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Tuesday, February 9, 2010, 9:09 PM</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      --- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@... &gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And Neoclassicism has nothing common with serialism.</p><p>Thank you.  -Carl</p></div><h3><a id=86206 href="#86206">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forr&#xFFFD; &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/9/2010 5:39:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Your examples show only rows made from 3, 4 or 6 tones subsets, what<br/>about the other possibilities?

It is more related to analysis of motifs than to harmonic analysis, but there may occur confusion, since the &quot;motifs&quot; are pitch/interval relations in this case.</p><p>Harmonic analysis concerning to movement requires further considerations using other approaches. One can classify the chord types used in a tonal composition (let us suppose it is a music with rich variety of chord types), but the relevant analysis (to obtain useful conclusions) begins when the usage of every chord type is investigated in context.

Thank you, by the way, for your<br/>very professional and courteous tone through this discussion.</p><p>&gt; &gt; This little example is just a demonstration.  But have you<br/>&gt; &gt; ever heard anything sound so familiar, yet so alien?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I liked the piece, as I said before.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But again: that does not exclude other kinds of music. You<br/>&gt; seems to think only pitch-oriented consonant music is valid.</p><p>No, I don&apos;t mean that.  However as I said before, I think<br/>there are strong arguments (not &quot;proofs&quot; as my detractors<br/>accuse) that the bandwidth composers can use to communicate<br/>is higher with pitched music.  This would not be relevant<br/>for individual pieces.  But when we are talking about the<br/>potential of an entire genre of music containing many pieces,<br/>I think it becomes relevant.</p><p>I just mentioned the idea of tracking harmonic number in<br/>chords (at least for roots, 3rds, 5ths and I think it might<br/>work with up to six identities at a time drawn from<br/>harmonics &lt; 18).</p><p>If we notate a music as a stream of frames (or hierarchy of<br/>frames like Schenker), each frame can have bytes telling<br/>about the relations I mentioned:</p><p>1. Address of previous frame which is an exact transposition<br/>of this frame, #FF if none.</p><p>2. Address of previous frame which is a modal transposition<br/>of this frame, #FF if none.</p><p>These would describe the frame vertically (all voices).<br/>Horizontally (each voice) we have also these two bytes, and:</p><p>3. Harmonic number of this pitch above fundamental.</p><p>Many of these messages will be available in atonal music.<br/>But in music concrete or noise percussion, we lose some or<br/>all of them.  We still have rhythm, and I said rhythm is the<br/>biggest part of music.  But to have complex rhythms we need<br/>source separation, and pitch is a very powerful way the mind<br/>assigns sounds to sources.  Without pitch we have only<br/>things like interaural timing, interaural loudness, and the<br/>HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function).  These do not work<br/>well in typical stereo recordings, which is the main medium<br/>for music concrete! (live performance is another matter).</p><p>Anyway, I don&apos;t want to dwell on this too much.  I like<br/>Dan Stearns&apos; music and some recent electronic music in the<br/>concrete tradition.  But I think it has less dynamic range<br/>as a total artform.  Dan may find this offensive, but I don&apos;t<br/>think he should.  He may disagree of course.  And I may be<br/>wrong, of course.</p><p>&gt; &gt; They are infinite.  You mean, restricted to 12-ET, or...?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First in 12-EDO, of course.</p><p>But of course!  :P</p><p>&gt; The most interesting ones might be tetrachords. But chords<br/>&gt; with 3 and 5 tones are sufficient, if 4-tones cannot be<br/>&gt; compared. They should be generated inside one octave, and<br/>&gt; then the pitches changed in relative position in every<br/>&gt; possible disposition -- if necessary, transpose them to fit<br/>&gt; inside the 2 octaves.</p><p>Because I&apos;m lazy I&apos;ll give you something slightly different<br/>for now.

In short, pitch-class set analysis abords interval materials and the way they are combined; it cannot do harmonic analysis in the usual meaning of the term.<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_85909.html#86220">/tuning/topicId_85909.html#86220</a></p><p>[...]<br/>&gt; I just mentioned the idea of tracking harmonic number in<br/>&gt; chords (at least for roots, 3rds, 5ths and I think it might<br/>&gt; work with up to six identities at a time drawn from<br/>&gt; harmonics &lt; 18).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we notate a music as a stream of frames (or hierarchy of<br/>&gt; frames like Schenker), each frame can have bytes telling<br/>&gt; about the relations I mentioned:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1. Address of previous frame which is an exact transposition<br/>&gt; of this frame, #FF if none.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2. Address of previous frame which is a modal transposition<br/>&gt; of this frame, #FF if none.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; These would describe the frame vertically (all voices).<br/>&gt; Horizontally (each voice) we have also these two bytes, and:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3. Harmonic number of this pitch above fundamental.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Many of these messages will be available in atonal music.</p><p>Interesting representation.</p><p>Atonality (pantonality) implies that item 3 is characterized by ambiguity and dynamic (moving) meaning.</p><p>&gt; But in music concrete or noise percussion, we lose some or<br/>&gt; all of them.  We still have rhythm, and I said rhythm is the<br/>&gt; biggest part of music.  But to have complex rhythms we need<br/>&gt; source separation, and pitch is a very powerful way the mind<br/>&gt; assigns sounds to sources.  Without pitch we have only<br/>&gt; things like interaural timing, interaural loudness, and the<br/>&gt; HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function).  These do not work<br/>&gt; well in typical stereo recordings, which is the main medium<br/>&gt; for music concrete! (live performance is another matter).</p><p>Yes. There are also interesting possibilities relating tones and noises: dense chords may sound like &quot;coloured&quot; or filtered noise, whereas percussion sounds may have a pitch &quot;centroid&quot; (I am not sure the word is proper, but I hope it carries idea) which allows organization in a sort of scale (a set of tom-toms, for example).</p><p>[...]<br/>&gt; &gt; The most interesting ones might be tetrachords. But chords<br/>&gt; &gt; with 3 and 5 tones are sufficient, if 4-tones cannot be<br/>&gt; &gt; compared. They should be generated inside one octave, and<br/>&gt; &gt; then the pitches changed in relative position in every<br/>&gt; &gt; possible disposition -- if necessary, transpose them to fit<br/>&gt; &gt; inside the 2 octaves.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because I&apos;m lazy I&apos;ll give you something slightly different<br/>&gt; for now.  Paul Erlich looked at all subsets of 600-ET<br/>&gt; using a Monte Carlo algorithm. . . .<br/>&gt;   Turns out it might have been easier to do it myself, than<br/>&gt; collecting all those old posts!

Ex.: Any major triads, it does not matter it occurs in any state, voicing, or arpeggio, belong to the same set class.</p><p>Traditionally, in pc-sets literature on post-tonal music (Forte, Straus etc.), also pitch groups that are &quot;mirrors&quot; each other are also included in the same pc-set class. This mirror is called &quot;inversion&quot;, but it is not chord inversion (which only changes the octave of some notes).</p><p>Example of inversion-related pc sets:<br/>Minor triad: {C,Eb,G} -&gt; intervals 3m 3M<br/>Major triad: {C,E,G}  -&gt; intervals 3M 3m</p><p>The inclusion of inversion-related sets in a single class has being questioned, by Larry Solomon, for example. Ex.: Any perfect triads, it does not matter they are major or minor, belong to a same set class in Forte&apos;s set list -- but they are separated in Solomon&apos;s list.</p><p>Prime form:<br/>===========</p><p>Prime for is a way to representate a set class using one of its representatives in condensed form. In 12-EDO section, I have represented prime forms like 037 (perfet triad), that is: 0=C, 3=Eb, 7=G.</p><p>Interval vector:<br/>================</p><p>Just for comparison, I listed also the interval vector of 12-EDO pc-sets.</p><p>The interval vector is the account of occurrences of interval classes (M3 and m6 belong to a same class) in a set, represented as a string of digits. The position of each digit represents an interval class, for semitone to tritone, left to right. Ex.: In 014 (C,C#,E), we have 1 m2, 1 m3 and 1 M3. The interval vector is [101100]. Now, in 037 (C,Eb,G), we have 1 m3, 1M3 and 1 P4 (P5), thus: [001110].</p><p>Set ID:<br/>=======</p><p>This is NOT standard in literature, it is just an index number to identify a set class in my programs.</p><p>Literature uses &quot;Forte names&quot; (they look like 5-1 or 4-Z29). For the 12-EDO sets, I have provided the corresponding Forte names in the results (previous message).</p><p>The numbers of my set IDs are an &quot;accidental&quot; result of the order the sets are generated in my programs, whereas Forte list obey a sorting criterium.</p><p>About the tests:<br/>================</p><p>The goal is to analyse the dissonance within a set class, and compare different set classes concerning to dissonance, using &quot;dissonance measure&quot; algorithm by Bill Sethares.</p><p>Chords dispositions:<br/>====================</p><p>The pitch-class sets were disposed as chords. Every permutation was evaluated for dissonance, with bass note C=261.63Hz.</p><p>I have not limited the pitch range, but no chord with adjacent voices distant by more than an octave were considered.</p><p>Example (pitches written in ascending order inside the chord):</p><p>For the major chord, we have 6 different permutations:</p><p>C E G (Fundamental)<br/>C G E (Fund.)<br/>C Eb Ab (1st inv.)<br/>C Ab Eb (1st. inv.)<br/>C F A (2nd inv.)<br/>C A F (2nd. inv.)</p><p>How to interpret the plots:<br/>===========================</p><p>The dissonance results for the chords above are at right side in the figure c3mod12.png, near the x-axis value 11 (Set ID), but slightly left.</p><p>The inversion-related set in this case is the minor chord, which results are slightly to the right, also near the x-axis value 11.</p><p>Note, still, in figure c3mod12.png, that several set classes have only one column, for example ID 12 (the augmented triad). Those sets are symmetrical (inversion==transposition).</p><p>To know which set class corresponds to a position in the figure, look below in the plot for the ID number, and then seek for it in the sets list (in my previous message or in the files I am going to upload).</p><p>The figure names mean, for example: c3mod12.png -&gt; sets with cardinality 3 (3-element) in modulo 12 (12-EDO).</p><p>I hope this can help.

See c3mod12.png and c3mod12diss.txt.</p><p>-- Traditional &quot;consonant&quot; chords, like perfect triads, have a narrow range of dissonance, usually reach the minima for all classes (with equal number of elements).

It seems like it would be most<br/>&gt; &gt; natural...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regular mappings assume the basics of group theory, which are, for<br/>&gt; those following at home:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Intervals can add to give other intervals<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - You can invert an interval<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - The way they add has a reasonable level of consistency<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, yes, inversions are already there.  I don&apos;t think a music theory<br/>&gt; would make sense where an ascending and descending perfect fourth (for<br/>&gt; example) weren&apos;t considered to be related intervals.  That means any<br/>&gt; theory based on these principles will allow you to invert a melody.<br/>&gt; Whether it makes musical sense is another matter.</p><p>Well, group theory, and the Dihedral Group of course indicate that<br/>mirror inversion is significant, where mirror inversions are identified with one another.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regular temperaments don&apos;t require Grassman algebra.  Everything I<br/>&gt; need is in plain matrix algebra.  There are also some things, like the<br/>&gt; parametric badness, that I can only do with matrices.  Perhaps that&apos;s<br/>&gt; my weakness -- I think the two algebras should be functionally<br/>&gt; equivalent.  Either follow those rules of group theory.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>&gt; There are cases where regular temperaments do imply rules about<br/>&gt; inversions.  And interval has the same complexity as its inversion.<br/>&gt; The same is true of a chord (under mathematical inversion).  If you<br/>&gt; can write a given phrase in a given MOS, you can be sure that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; inversion will exist as well, at a suitable transposition point.  I<br/>&gt; think the consensus is that o/utonal equivalence isn&apos;t a perfect rule<br/>&gt; of harmony, but still, the algebra implies it.  Theories that assume<br/>&gt; it will work fine with regular mappings.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s interesting that there is no specific point where a musical<br/>set is inverted (mirror image).

You could take MOS scales but I don&apos;t know if that&apos;d give<br/>&gt; interesting results different to the equivalent equal temperament, and<br/>&gt; anyway the results wouldn&apos;t be very general.  You can also take a 35<br/>&gt; note set for Z5xZ7 (I think that&apos;s right) but it doesn&apos;t have any<br/>&gt; musical meaning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 0,3,6,9<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 4,7,10,1<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; 8,11,2,5<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; is obviously 12-tET specific. &Acirc;&nbsp;How would this transformation be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; written in other equal temperaments?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well 24 is another hotbed for this, prime temperaments don&apos;t have<br/>&gt; &gt; this kind of decomposition of course...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then it can&apos;t work for rank 2 temperaments.  And 24-tET has the same<br/>&gt; 5-limit mapping as 12-tET.  So this is specific to that mapping.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                          Graham</p><p>Well, at least then 24-tET should be pretty well behaved if 12-tET is.<br/>Isn&apos;t there torsion here?</p><p>I guess once again periodicity lattices based on infinite groups<br/>would have to be related by to finite periodicity lattices some<br/>way in order to apply these group-theoretical counting techniques.</p><p>That&apos;s what I am working with lately.
