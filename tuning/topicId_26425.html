If this was totally true melody would be<br/>impossible.I guess I was playing both sides of the game !.</p><p>My feeling is that tempo has alot to do with it. For instance if we slow a chord<br/>progression right down [I believe La Monte Young has done this with blues]<br/>memory becomes less important. Also various devices can [in my experience] make<br/>the present time experience so interesting that memory has no importance or<br/>bearing [repetition, extreemly fast and complex rhythms etc.].</p><p>But a melody at a moderate tempo will rely on memory much more.</p><p>&gt;&gt; And if we are remembering former phrases where is our<br/>&gt;&gt; attention ?</p><p>&gt;Many levels of attention, in many degrees of rememberance. A pitch<br/>&gt;set (particularly one with 5-10 notes) makes its mark on our musical<br/>&gt;mind, and if the set is &quot;coherent&quot; enough, a change in this set<br/>&gt;stands out as a musical &quot;event&quot; of significance.</p><p>Agreed. One of the main points I was making though was that analysis should be<br/>based on compositions and reflect how compositions change over time.</p><p>Taking for examples sake Partch&apos;s 43 tone scale and analysing this as a<br/>periodicty block,  constant structure or improper or not does not tell us much<br/>about Partchs music other than how the instruments were tuned. H.P cursed Cage<br/>for mentioning 43.</p><p>I do admit that these theories are important. But mostly for instrument design<br/>etc.</p><p>The fact that the struti system is improper does not mean that some raags cannot<br/>be strictly proper.</p><p>I guess I am calling for some awareness of the imperfections of our static<br/>measuring systems so that we don&apos;t start worshipping them.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Do we continually relate every new pitch back to pitches sounded<br/>&gt;&gt; earlier ?</p><p>&gt;Yes, but not to the extent claimed by Boomsliter &amp; Creel (IMHO),<br/>&gt;which you (ironically enough) seem very impressed by.</p><p>Ironic only if you think these positions are mutually exclusive. I think that<br/>they are both correct. See above re: tempo.</p><p>B&amp;C&apos;s theories are all based on interpretations of empirical evidence and<br/>aesthetic intonation choices made by musicians. Time would obviously have been<br/>accounted for, if only because the test subjects were selcting pitches for<br/>music, not playing with numbers and geometric ideas.</p><p>B&amp;C&apos;s studies could [IMHO] only be lacking in their interpretation of the data.<br/>Perhaps extended reference and direct reference of higher partials [a la Monzo&apos;s<br/>work] are at play ?</p><p>Anyway it works for what I&apos;m doing now musicwise. That&apos;s really all that<br/>matters.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Can a scale be said to be strictly proper if not all the pitches in<br/>the scale<br/>&gt;&gt; are used ?</p><p>&gt;That would seem hard to justify, wouldn&apos;t it?</p><p>And Joe wrote<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Any thoughts about how time can sometimes laugh<br/>&gt;&gt; at our timeless [all pitches at once theories] ?</p><p>&gt;Hi Justin,</p><p>&gt;This is something I touch on at the very end of my book.<br/>&gt;It&apos;s interesting to me that, from my perspective, even<br/>&gt;harmonic analysis is totally time-dependent.</p><p>&gt;If one is analyzing pitches in terms of their frequency<br/>&gt;ratios, one is certainly taking time into consideration,<br/>&gt;since frequency is defined as the number of waveform periods<br/>&gt;*per second of time*.</p><p>Good point ! But some theories especially those to do with scale construction,<br/>and melody etc. are lacking in the time dept.</p><p>&gt;The first thing I teach any of my new music students<br/>&gt;is that music is unique among all art-forms because it<br/>&gt;is the only abstract art which requires prolongation thru<br/>&gt;time in order to be perceived.  Every aspect of it, except<br/>&gt;the &quot;timeless all pitches at once theory&quot;, involves time.</p><p>I wish I had yourself as my music teacher !</p><p>Haresh wrote</p><p> &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hareshbakshi@hotmail.com">hareshbakshi@hotmail.com</a>&gt;</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Justin White&quot; &lt;justin.white@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But real music does not consider every note that exists in a<br/>scale or gamut.

Paul<br/>mentions that he finds them useful due to the way he thinks about music. This I<br/>imagine is good for Paul who understands that the piece modulates etc. Other<br/>less experienced fellows may be misled into thinking of it as some sort<br/>monophonic fabric. Oh well each to his own.</p><p>&lt;Hi Justin,</p><p>You bring up a very interesting point which I myeslf have been noticing about<br/>some of the analysis. To be specific I have seen a few diagrams, lattices, etc<br/>lately of some of Ben Johnston&apos;s work. I use this example only because I am<br/>thoroughly familiar with his work.</p><p>Some of the diagrams shown on here have been, so to speak, complete lattices of<br/>an entire piece. Specifically posted not long ago were lists of notes with the<br/>6th quartet, if I remember correctly.&gt;</p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Message: 14<br/>   Date: Mon, 23 Jul 2001 18:59:10 EDT<br/>   From: <a href="mailto:PageWizard17@aol.com">PageWizard17@aol.com</a><br/>Subject: Re: Time ignored ?</p><p>Brent</p><p>wrote,</p><p>&lt;Justin,</p><p>    I have believed for quite a long time now, even in the ignorant presence<br/>of the 12 ET system, that when time is involved with a scale system, the<br/>consonance/dissonance of the scale is determined by the complex relations<br/>between the ratios before and theoretically after it.  You can see this<br/>simply by taking even a very &quot;consonant chord&quot; such as a sus4 and placing it<br/>in the middle of a dissonant chord progression.  Subjectively, the individual<br/>chordal consonance is sacrificed and combined with the other dissonances or<br/>consonances of the progression.  This is why an entire composition in memory<br/>will seem as roughly one huge &quot;watercolor&quot; chord.  The brain tends to group<br/>similar things into one. &gt;</p><p>Yes I agree with this but when I was a teenageer I had the revelation that I<br/>could play any chord next to each other and if I played my chords slow enough I<br/>would forget the chord that came before. Read what I said on tempo.</p><p>&lt; This is also evident with overtones and octave<br/>equivalence and with all consonances for that matter.<br/>    I believe the that the sole reason of consonance is due to the similarity<br/>it bears to the reference.  Since unity is the ultimate consonance, any other<br/>tone which bears a closer resemblance to unity will have a stronger<br/>consonance than any tone which does not.&gt;</p><p>Yep some people say that this is exactly what consonance is. I&apos;d agree.</p><p>&lt;  As of now, though, I cannot concern<br/>myself particularly with the complexities which time and memory involve,<br/>though I still enjoy theorizing about it.  In order to find the optimal<br/>tuning system, I must first search after purity of ratios.  I feel that there<br/>are many ratios, possessing certain purities, which have never been<br/>discovered.&gt;</p><p>I think all the important consonances based on the harmonic series have been<br/>discovered already but there is endless fields of investigation to find new and<br/>exciting ways of organising these basic building blocks.</p><p>&lt;  It would only be through the experimentation of a new system<br/>that I would be able to figure out what its true potential was.  I have been<br/>doing such experimentation with the 12 ET system.  I have found that it lacks<br/>consonance to a large degree.  There are few real &quot;consonances&quot; with 12 ET.<br/>There are a great deal of dissonances that exist.  These dissonances are not<br/>very good either because they tend to &quot;blend&quot; into one another.  I have<br/>discovered that this blending is no good.  Each individual tone, or chord,<br/>should have a distinct quality whether that be a consonant or a dissonant<br/>one.&gt;</p><p>You should read Harry Partchs &apos;Genesis of a Music&apos; if you haven&apos;t already done<br/>so.</p><p>You will find him and his philosophy kindred spirits.</p><p>&lt; This will allow the a piece of music in the new system to have a<br/>stronger effect upon one&apos;s perceived memory.  This will also make music much<br/>more powerful since it is the computation of the relations between ratios<br/>which gives music its strengths or weaknesses.  Please let me know what you<br/>think.&gt;</p><p>Absolutely ! Go for it. Music thrives on contrasts and personally I despise<br/>music in shades of grey.</p><p>Paul then replied to Andy,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., JoJoBuBu@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; With Johnston&apos;s work it is all about modulation to microtonal keys.<br/>&gt;Lets say for example he uses a major chord. I&apos;m using this example<br/>&gt;merely for simplicity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C-E-G.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Now lets say he modulates to, in his notation, C-(C minus). He<br/>&gt;&gt;would argue that this the same chord modulated down via comma. To<br/>&gt;&gt;look at this and list all 6 pitch classes is not as important as<br/>&gt;&gt;understanding that the music modulates.</p><p>&gt;But even more important is, how does he get there? From C to C-?<br/>&gt;Surely by going through some intermediate regions in the lattice, yes?</p><p>&gt;&gt; On a last note this is not intended as a thorough description of<br/>&gt;&gt;Ben&apos;s modulation technique so please dont take it as such. In a<br/>&gt;&gt;nutshell however its basically standard modulation technique.
