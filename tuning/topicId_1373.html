All support the syntonic comma (i.e., show net microtonal<br/>&gt; motion) in the progression I-vi-ii-V-I.  All have two major second<br/>&gt; intervals: four fifths do NOT equal a major third.</p><p>As it turns out -- if only I had noticed -- &quot;Paul H. Erlich&quot; was part<br/>of the _title_ of the article, not the author. Since no quotes were<br/>involved in this message, I suppose that my &quot;correct attribution<br/>guard&quot; was relaxed -- but the lesson here may be that to misattribute<br/>is human, and to forgive, divine.</p><p>Of course, I can now express my appreciation to the correct person,<br/>John, for giving me occasion to consider the way in which 53-tet<br/>permits approximating an M3 of 81:64, 5:4, or 9:7; at the same time,<br/>I&apos;m delighted to affirm that Paul Erlich has indeed also been an<br/>inspiration in my own study of matters xenharmonic.</p><p>Most appreciatively, with due apologies,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
