It would be ideal to be able to create user-<br/>defined scales.  A lot of the scales are similar in Arabic and<br/>Armenian music.  tiny interval rubber banding effects (variations)<br/>create the touch or the accent of a specific nation.</p><p>In Persian music whole tones are slightly larger that 200<br/>cents, about 210 cents, closer to major 2nd, a ratio of 9/8.</p><p>half-tones are flatter/smaller, about 90 cents.</p><p>There is an extra interval of 140 cents or a freq ratio<br/>of 13/12. say between E and Fsori (F+40cents)<br/>or between G and Ak( Akoron =A-60cents)</p><p>main scales:==========</p><p>chahargah in C, also known as Le Gamme Espannol:<br/>C   D-60cents  E-10  F    G   A-60cents    B   C<br/>(I use E-10 instead of E to get closer to diatonic E)</p><p>Shoor in E:<br/>C   D   E  F+40cents   G   A   B   C<br/>(this is the same scale for Bayat-e Tork in G;  Nava, Abu Atta and Afshary<br/>in<br/>A and dashty in B)</p><p>Segah in D, some call it Segah in Fsori=F+40cents for although the<br/>scales bottom is D, the melodies fly around Fsori:<br/>C   D   E  F+40cents   G   A   B-60   C</p><p>Esfehan or the Persian Minor in C:<br/>C   D+10   Eb-10  F   G   A-60  Bnatural  C</p><p>Mokhalef in C<br/>G       A-60cents     B-60cents        C          D+10       Eb-10<br/>It may look like that the interval between B-60 and C is<br/>160 cents, but on a setar, since the whole tone interval from A-60 to B- 60<br/>is 210 cents or more, we have 140,210,140 intervals between<br/>G, A and B with some rubberband effect (every thing streching) to fill<br/>spaces.<br/>In practice, using chromatic values of G, A, B, etc on a sound module<br/>and modifying them as above sounds pretty OK.</p><p>Mohammad</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>Dr. Mohammad Gharib<br/><a href="mailto:moh@caltech.edu">moh@caltech.edu</a><br/>(626) 395-4759<br/><a href="http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/~moh">http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/~moh</a><br/>Graduate Aeronautical Laboratories<br/>California Institute of Technology<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>&gt;For that matter, have you thought about other ETs in which the fifth<br/>&gt;isn&apos;t so far off, such as 53-tET (as Kraig Grady pointed out) at least<br/>&gt;for Arabic music, if not Persian?</p><p>Turkish music is (theoretically) based on 53-tET or 53-tone Pythagorean<br/>(almost identical), and they have their own versions of Arabic scales which<br/>one may consider &quot;close enough&quot;.
