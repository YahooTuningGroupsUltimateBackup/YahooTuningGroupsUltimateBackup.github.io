For what it&apos;s worth, tuning - timbre<br/>relationships become very evident on a Tonal Plexus<br/>keyboard, where depending on the timbre of a given<br/>patch, the most consonant sounding intervals are not<br/>always the same fingering in the default JND tuning. This<br/>goes for any interval, including the octave! I found right<br/>away that a patch which uses stretched harmonics can<br/>sound smoother when the interval patterns used on the<br/>keyboard stretch by an extra key = one JND larger.<br/>Sometimes two, or sometimes compressing in the<br/>opposite direction, for example with meantone fifths.<br/>Anyway, playing around with timbre and tuning on the<br/>TP is a lot of fun and for me it was a revelation, being<br/>able to experiment with it right there at the keyboard<br/>in real time.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Charles Lucy wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Sounds like an interesting idea.<br/>&gt; &gt; So you are proposing that by inputting frequencies having LucyTuned<br/>&gt; &gt; intervals, it will generate a particular timbre which represents the<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt; I have mainly been experimenting with samples and real fretted instruments.<br/>&gt; &gt; I Mac OSX running; what application do you suggest would be suitable?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can do it with Csound but I don&apos;t know if Csound would<br/>&gt; be to your taste.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What do you mean by factors of pi?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s what Keenan said, of course.

They wouldn&apos;t have<br/>&gt; &gt; anything more to do with pi than LucyTuning itself.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m just saying that, according to Bill Sethares&apos;s book, if you<br/>&gt; use sounds with harmonic spectra, you cannot dismiss the effect<br/>&gt; of just intonation. If Charles Lucy says his tuning is not &quot;just&quot;<br/>&gt; (no pun intended) another approximation to JI, but instead has<br/>&gt; something special to do with pi, he should use anharmonic sounds<br/>&gt; to match that.</p><p>One of Charles&apos; only decipherable claims is that the beat rates<br/>in LucyTuning (as apart from other meantones, presumably) are the<br/>right ones for entraining the brain into alpha rhythms.<br/>Zero-beating the intervals is exactly what he doesn&apos;t want.<br/>But even if he did, the spectra would not be any more pi-based<br/>than the tuning -- which is to say not very much -- it would be<br/>nearly harmonic with offsets given by the errors of LucyTuning.<br/>[Granted, it could be any wide-enough intervals in LucyTuning,<br/>but you&apos;ll get bell-like results if you don&apos;t use roughly<br/>harmonic spacing.]</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=73502 href="#73502">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Lucy &#x3C;lucy@harmonics.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2007 12:40:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for clarifying that Keenan;</p><p>I&apos;ll play with the numbers;-)</p><p>As a matter of mathematical interest, in the mid 1970&apos;s, the mathematical connection between pi and phi was found.</p><p>Details here:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/academic/pi_phi.html">http://www.lucytune.com/academic/pi_phi.html</a></p><p>Charles Lucy <a href="mailto:lucy@lucytune.com">lucy@lucytune.com</a></p><p>-----  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -----</p><p>For information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a></p><p>LucyTuned Lullabies (from around the world):<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a></p><p>Skype user = lucytune</p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/lucytuning">http://www.myspace.com/lucytuning</a></p><p>On 22 Sep 2007, at 22:06, Keenan Pepper wrote:</p><p>&gt; On 9/21/07, Charles Lucy &lt;<a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; This page shows the figures for the phi (Kornerup) tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.lucytune.com/tuning/mean_tone.html">http://www.lucytune.com/tuning/mean_tone.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The idea is that the ratio between the Large and small intervals &gt; is phi.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right, this is what people usually mean when they say &quot;golden<br/>&gt; meantone&quot;. The actual value for the fifth is 2^((8-phi)/11), and it<br/>&gt; has the special property that the MOSes make a kind of Fibonacci<br/>&gt; sequence: 5, 7, 12, 19, 31... where each number is the sum of the<br/>&gt; previous two. Most meantone fifths will match this sequence for the<br/>&gt; first few numbers, but the golden fifth is the only one that makes the<br/>&gt; pattern continue forever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is quite different from the fifth Cameron was talking about,<br/>&gt; which is (1+4*phi)/5 (note the lack of any exponent). This has no<br/>&gt; special MOS-related properties AFAICT.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The golden fifth comes from making the golden cut in logarithmic pitch<br/>&gt; space (cents), and Cameron&apos;s fifth comes from making it in linear<br/>&gt; frequency space (Hz).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keenan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=73503 href="#73503">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Lucy &#x3C;lucy@harmonics.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/23/2007 1:04:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes, Carl that&apos;s what I would have thought too.</p><p>I probably do have the technology to produce the sounds (timbres), yet need to learn and experiment how to generate the frequencies using CSound or MetaSynth.</p><p>(which I have yet to get running on Intel)</p><p>Tony Salinas suggested that I might be able to produce them using Spear.
