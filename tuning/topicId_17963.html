The original thread you refer to was in<br/>response to your claim to be singing &quot;undertones&quot;, in the sense of partials<br/>below a fundamental following the undertone series. At that time, we<br/>determined that that was in fact not what was happening, but rather that you<br/>were dropping the fundamental in register and still producing an overtone<br/>series.</p><p>The example you mention (#8 on Fuks&apos; site) is similar, in that at no time is<br/>there an &quot;undertone&quot; series of partials being produced. In this case, he is<br/>&quot;underblowing&quot; his larynx to drop the fundamental, and indeed the<br/>underblowing is causing this to happen follwing a u-tonal series. Why this<br/>should be the case is very interesting, but in a way it makes sense based on<br/>the mechanism he describes. Nevertheless, the spectrum at any given time<br/>would show a normal overtone series in the sound.</p><p>Perhaps this is why you call it &quot;subfundamental&quot; singing, as opposed to<br/>&quot;undertone&quot; singing?(although this word is used on Fuks&apos; site, apparently in<br/>reference to the Tibetan singing. I don&apos;t know why?)</p><p>If &quot;subfundamental&quot; refers to the &quot;underblowing&quot; effect, than I suppose it<br/>is accurate, as long as it is not implied that there is any kind of<br/>&quot;subharmonic&quot; spectrum being produced.</p><p>Dante</p><p>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: <a href="mailto:jimcole@spectralvoices.com">jimcole@spectralvoices.com</a> [<a href="mailto:jimcole@spectralvoices.com">mailto:jimcole@spectralvoices.com</a>]<br/>Sent: Friday, January 26, 2001 12:04 AM<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a><br/>Subject: [tuning] subfundamental singing a la Leonardo Fuks...</p><p>For those of you who were interested and may remember a thread a<br/>while back regarding &quot;subharmonic&quot; singing, there is link I&apos;d like to<br/>invite you to follow and hear Leonardo Fuks sing a fundamental in<br/>tenor range - then access a subfundamental an octave below (f/2),<br/>then f/3, f/4, f/5 and then back up through that &quot;undertone&quot; series -<br/>all done very clearly and within a 20-second sound clip at his site.</p><p>Haven&apos;t been here in a long time - just wandered in and looked at a<br/>few posts - good to see your presence here David Beardsley :-)</p><p>Please follow the link at the bottom of the sound clips page at our<br/>site (<a href="http://spectralvoices.com">spectralvoices.com</a>) to Leonardo&apos;s site - choose clip #8 at his<br/>site for an awesome vocal demonstration...</p><p>Enjoy,</p><p>~Jim Cole<br/>Spectral Spiral Music<br/><a href="http://www.spectralvoices.com">http://www.spectralvoices.com</a></p><p>You do not need web access to participate.

I realize still that my motivation for using<br/>that terminology then was based on the fact that in my and many other<br/>people&apos;s voices the notes accessed downward from an initiated<br/>fundamental almost always appear at the intervals you heard in Fuks&apos;<br/>clip and moving the tones around (almost)always happens in that<br/>particular structure.  The term itself is not so important for me as<br/>understanding why the subfundamentals seem so very dependant on the<br/>initiated fundamental.  Several folks have noted that the fundamental<br/>is one source and the subfundamental is another source - I am<br/>comfortable with the term &quot;subfundamental&quot; to refer to the tones<br/>generated with these odd vocal stylings yet the relationship of f to<br/>all the subf&apos;s that succeed it is curiously hard to grapple with<br/>apparantly.  Just when I thought for sure the subf&apos;s were always<br/>generated in some way by the originating f I heard Geoffrey Brown<br/>(who sings with us) fry into a tone a major 6th below his<br/>fundamental - it was very clear! - two days later someone at the<br/>throat singing list described and found evidence for (thru<br/>spectrogram analysis) subfundamentals being generated from a harmonic<br/>overtone of the fundamental (his examples were f2/3 and f5/7 - I have<br/>not heard the clip)...!!!! Ex: Geoff&apos;s tone may well have been<br/>subfundamental #5 of harmonic overtone 3 (f5/3) - this poster&apos;s<br/>theory totally blew me away because I never considered harmonic<br/>overtones as sources for subfundamentals.  So imagine: a subfund.<br/>from a harmonic from a fundamental - that generates its own series!<br/>The web gets quickly thick!!!</p><p>&gt; The example you mention (#8 on Fuks&apos; site) is similar, in that at<br/>no time is<br/>&gt; there an &quot;undertone&quot; series of partials being produced.

Nevertheless, the spectrum at any given<br/>time<br/>&gt; would show a normal overtone series in the sound.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t according to the folks who are looking at the spectrograms<br/>generated.  There seems to be two or more series &quot;trees&quot; - I cannot<br/>assert this though as I haven&apos;t seen the spectrograms in detail.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps this is why you call it &quot;subfundamental&quot; singing, as<br/>opposed to<br/>&gt; &quot;undertone&quot; singing?(although this word is used on Fuks&apos; site,<br/>apparently in<br/>&gt; reference to the Tibetan singing. I don&apos;t know why?)</p><p>Yes, each subfundamental generates its own harmonic overtone series.<br/>I knew this long ago from listening experience, but only recently<br/>(due to another poster&apos;s comments on the ts&apos;ing list) embraced this<br/>terminology.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If &quot;subfundamental&quot; refers to the &quot;underblowing&quot; effect, than I<br/>suppose it<br/>&gt; is accurate, as long as it is not implied that there is any kind of<br/>&gt; &quot;subharmonic&quot; spectrum being produced.</p><p>Whatever&apos;s going on, it&apos;s a much different process than most vocal<br/>sound generation and the sound quality is much different than the<br/>sound of a bass singer or profundo guy getting down there.  At any<br/>rate, it&apos;s fascinating stuff to ponder and wonderful vocal sounds to<br/>experience.</p><p>Thanks for your post Dante!</p><p>~Jim<br/>Spectral Spiral Music<br/><a href="http://www.spectralvoices.com">http://www.spectralvoices.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=17977 href="#17977">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

You can also think of it as the set of harmonics of the<br/>subharmonics. Either way.</p><p>Anyhow, while you were away from this list, I think, we had more extensive<br/>discussions on throat-singing, and I suggested that this is simply a case of<br/>non-linear dynamics as illustrated in most texts on chaos. Someone (I think<br/>it was Dave Keenan) performed a computer simulation of a non-linear<br/>dynamical system and found that, even in the totally chaotic region of<br/>parameter space, the resulting spectrum seemed to always consist of<br/>frequencies of the form f*(m/n), where m and n are simple integers.</p><p>&gt;Okay, I accept there is no &quot;actual&quot; undertone series of partials<br/>&gt;being produced, yet the relationship of tones accessed stepwise is<br/>&gt;indeed curious!  what does &quot;underblowing&quot; actually mean - what<br/>&gt;process is referred to and why does this follow a u-tonal series?</p><p>Because the period is always a multiple of the period of the &quot;normal&quot;<br/>fundamental:</p><p>&gt;Bernard Dubreuil (at ts&apos;ing list) found through his research with<br/>&gt;Tran Quang Hai that the subfundamentals are generated from the false<br/>&gt;folds (periods presumably every other, every third...etc. pulse from<br/>&gt;the true folds) by some people and as an alternate periodicity on the<br/>&gt;vocal folds in other people (I suppose this depends on the &quot;style&quot;<br/>&gt;used too).</p><p>Yes -- either way you have a fine explanation of this phenomenon, which<br/>ultimately derives from the non-linear mechanics operating within the vocal<br/>tract, and which gives rise to this period-multiplying behavior. John<br/>Starrett may be able to add something -- he&apos;s an expert on non-linear<br/>dynamics.</p></div>
