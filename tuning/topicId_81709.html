These 2 are allways combined<br/>in a piano, but when writing a held note in 12tet you can have a shifting<br/>note without a new percussive instance. So it would not be correct to see<br/>this as a new note strike on the piano for instance, I&apos;d see this as<br/>modifying the composition, shifting a note is not modifying the composition.<br/>So 12tet gives the magic ability to an instrument that can&apos;t shift notes<br/>without a new percussive instance, the ability to do just this.<br/>JI doesn&apos;t give this ability to instruments becuase there is no enharmonic<br/>equivalence.<br/>Anyhow this is to do with instruments in 12tet vs JI.<br/>But in music all 12tet can be played perfectly in pure JI.<br/>If you don&apos;t yet see this look better at my above example for instance or<br/>state clearly your other misbeleifs why JI wouldn&apos;t be able to do this or<br/>that.</p><p>Marcel</p></div><h3><a id=81806 href="#81806">ðŸ”—</a>Marcel de Velde &#x3C;m.develde@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2009 7:38:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>One could make a tempering where one tempers all notes in all octaves to<br/>just one note.Then one would only have to hold that one note for an hour or<br/>so to play the complete beethoven 5th :)<br/>12tet vs JI is same kind of story.<br/>A held note can be more than one note.

(though<br/>this is more of a music theory, understanding of the structure of music and<br/>what&apos;s beeing said musically)<br/>There are other difficulties in when a chord is for instance 1/1 6/5 3/2 or<br/>can also be 1/1 32/27 3/2. In modern music this is not allways clear, but<br/>there will allways be a solution.<br/>So with the comma shift in held notes solved, and explained why it is indeed<br/>correct and a nessecity for correct JI, there is no problem in doing pure JI<br/>except for the practical difficulties in understanding the structure of<br/>certain compositions.</p><p>Btw sorry I did not provide midi demos yet but I found cakewalk sonar to not<br/>handle scala tuned midi files correctly so I could not edit them to make a<br/>held note shift.

Wether it&apos;s in that particualr<br/>composition or in a different composition or as a chordal progression all by<br/>itself.</p><p>Therefore your 2 ways that keep track of comma shifts and as soon as a comma<br/>shift occurs produce an opposite shift when it doesn&apos;t sound offensive is<br/>completely the wrong way that will allmost allways produce out of tune<br/>music.</p><p>Take my simple example:<br/>F5(4/3)-A5(5/3)-C6(2/1) -&gt; C5(1/1)-E5(5/4)-G5(3/2) -&gt;<br/>G5(3/2)-B5(15/8)-D6(9/4) -&gt; D5(9/8)-F#5(45/32)-A5(27/16) -&gt;<br/>F5(4/3)-A5(5/3)-C6(2/1)<br/>-&gt; C5(1/1)-E5(5/4)-G5(3/2) -&gt; G5(3/2)-B5(15/8)-D6(9/4) -&gt;<br/>D5(9/8)-F#5(45/32)-A5(27/16) -&gt; F5(4/3)-A5(5/3)-C6(2/1) -&gt;<br/>C5(1/1)-E5(5/4)-G5(3/2) -&gt; G5(3/2)-B5(15/8)-D6(9/4) -&gt;<br/>D5(9/8)-F#5(45/32)-A5(27/16) etc</p><p>As you can see the A5 note gets a comma shift from 27/16 to 5/3. You can<br/>write this / do this shift in a held note or as 2 different notes it doesn&apos;t<br/>make a difference.<br/>This is not a shift by choice. It is a mandatory shift if you wish to play<br/>the music correctly.<br/>And there is no shift back as you can see. The chords progress in such a way<br/>that there is only a shift from 27/16 to 5/3, and no sudden shift back yet<br/>the overall pitch does not go up and down as you continue to repeat this<br/>chordal progression.</p><p>All harmonic classical music that contains such a shift must be played in<br/>this way otherwise you will be out of tune.<br/>It is not usually the choice of the performer (unless one can interpret the<br/>music in different ways) but is fixed in the composition / music itself.</p><p>&gt; Back to classical music however I have more than one objection.<br/>&gt; I do not find that it is not even a new idea at all: problem is, it was<br/>&gt; considered inappropriate by classical writers and composers.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes I know it&apos;s not a new idea.<br/>But the idea has been misunderstood and wrongly executed and therefore<br/>rejected while it shouldn&apos;t have been.</p><p>&gt; They found the comma shift, by over 20 Cents, absolutely intollerable.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes when performed wrongly it&apos;s absolutely intollerable.<br/>When done correctly it&apos;s perfectly tollereable, infact it&apos;s perfect and<br/>sounds best.</p><p>One way to do it wrongly is to simply perform this comma shift at a wrong<br/>place, which is offcourse intolerable.<br/>Another way to view it wrongly is to take my above JI example and then<br/>extract a melody out of it&apos;s harmonic context.<br/>For instance A5 -&gt; G5 -&gt; B5 -&gt; A5 -&gt; A5 -&gt; G5 -&gt; B5 -&gt; A5 -&gt; A5 etc<br/>Now use the tuning these tones get in the JI chordal progression above:<br/>A5(5/3) -&gt; G5(3/2) -&gt; B5(15/8) -&gt; A5(27/16) -&gt; A5(5/3) -&gt; G5(3/2) -&gt;<br/>B5(15/8) -&gt; A5(27/16) -&gt; A5(5/3) etc<br/>Now when playing the melody like this on it&apos;s own you may think hey this<br/>sounds wrong.<br/>You may imagine for instance a fixed note C5(1/1) and judge the melody<br/>against this.<br/>And indeed in 12tet this you can do.<br/>But in JI the chordal progression made clear what the real melody is in the<br/>case of the chordal progression.<br/>And it is not thesame as when playing these same 12tet notes on their own<br/>judged against a fixed note and not as in the modulations of the chordal<br/>progression.<br/>So when on it&apos;s own one would expect something like:<br/>A5(5/3) -&gt; G5(3/2) -&gt; B5(15/8) -&gt; A5(5/3) -&gt; A5(5/3) -&gt; G5(3/2) -&gt; B5(15/8)<br/>-&gt; A5(5/3) -&gt; A5(5/3) etc<br/>This is perfectly logical and ok. This does not mean that the comma shift in<br/>the chordal progression is wrong, it&apos;s simply a different melody with a<br/>different structure.<br/>It is one of the functions of harmony and bass etc to make clear the<br/>structure of the melody. So different chords / bass movements make different<br/>melodies clear, this is a great function of music. It doesn&apos;t mean comma<br/>shifts are wrong.<br/>Comma shifts only sound wrong when done in the wrong way.</p><p>&gt; Let us remember that they were very sensitive to tuning, as proved by the<br/>&gt; success of ET31 in Renaissance times, further proving the level of accuracy<br/>&gt; they expected meantone tuning to reach.<br/>&gt; For them a comma shift was intollerable, and accordingly music was written<br/>&gt; for - and meant to be performed with - non-JI temperaments.<br/>&gt; Even when voices and violins performed pure intervals (a tendency already<br/>&gt; observed by Renaissance writers) it was to perform momentary adjustments to<br/>&gt; different types of temperaments (meantone, circular, equal), NOT to play<br/>&gt; throughout in JI or pure intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Again, they must have been doing wrong comma shifts after which they found<br/>them intolerable.<br/>One must understand the structure of music in order to do correct comma<br/>shifts, it&apos;s much easyer to do them wrong.</p><p>&gt; Summing up, you are free of course to find ways to perform classical music<br/>&gt; in JI with &quot;compensation shifts&quot;.<br/>&gt; Not that easy in Baroque music, it is certainly easier in later music, with<br/>&gt; its pauses and changes of mood.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s pretty easy in baroque music i think.<br/>I find it gets harder in modern music with so many modulations and broken<br/>chords it gets harder to read the structure of the music.</p><p>&gt; Problem is, it is be hopelessly unauthentic: the music was not written with<br/>&gt; those effects in mind.<br/>&gt; [It is the same as playing Bach on a piano or with jazz rhythm.

I&apos;ve never heard about &quot;sharp second&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Second there&apos;s sometimes natural, sometimes sharp, sometimes double<br/>&gt; sharp connected with augmented second in the scale, so to use sign<br/>&gt; #II is not always quite exact. Better is to use neutral +II or II+<br/>&gt; which can be used in all those cases. But it&apos;s unusual to use Roman<br/>&gt; capitals for interval, as usually they are used for chord functions<br/>&gt; in tonality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using of harmonic major is quite common in western music of all kind.<br/>&gt; In this sense it has nothing to do with hijjaz tetrachord coming from<br/>&gt; Middle Eastern music (by the way, it&apos;s not limited to Balcan only, we<br/>&gt; can find it also in Jewish, Gipsy and Spanish music).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note Cb has nothing to do with C major.
