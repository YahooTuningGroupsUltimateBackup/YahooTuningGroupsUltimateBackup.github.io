Similarly, a<br/>pure Pythagorean tuning carried to 53 notes is a fine circulating<br/>tuning -- although in neither case is there _absolute_ symmetry or<br/>_precise_ mathematical closure as with 31-tet or 53-tet.</p><p>A circulating tuning need not be an _equal_ temperament, and 31-note<br/>meantone with pure major thirds or 53-note Pythagorean provides quite<br/>satisfactory _musical_ closure, although not exact mathematical<br/>closure.</p><p>The slight &quot;inaccuracy&quot; in the closure of Pythagorean 53 (~3.62 cents)<br/>or 1/4-comma meantone 31 (~6.07 cents) is in either case a much<br/>smaller factor of variation than that tolerated in 18th-century<br/>well-temperaments, for example.</p><p>In the case of a circulating 31-note meantone tuning, we have two<br/>lines of historical and recent tradition: the Vicentino-Colonna line<br/>calling for a &quot;common practice meantone&quot; tuning of the first 12 notes<br/>(Eb-G#) or 19 notes (Gb-B#), very likely meaning 1/4-comma with pure<br/>major thirds; and the Rossi-Huyghens-Fokker line calling for precise<br/>31-tet with major thirds very slightly larger than pure.</p><p>In either case, we have 6.07 cents or so of &quot;imperfect closure&quot; to<br/>deal with -- the amount by which 31 fifths tempered by 1/4-comma fall<br/>short of 18 pure octaves. In 31-tet, this discrepancy gets distributed<br/>nice and evenly among _all_ the fifths. In a 31-note version of<br/>1/4-comma meantone, it all gets distributed to _one_ odd fifth.</p><p>Let&apos;s see if there are any terrible consequences from the viewpoint of<br/>a circulating temperament of dumping this 6.07 cents on a single<br/>fifth:</p><p>           1. The affected fifth, which would regularly be ~5.38 cents<br/>              narrow, is instead almost exactly a just 3:2! --<br/>              actually, ~0.69 cents wide (~702.65 cents). Maybe this<br/>              phenomena provides the best response to the argument<br/>              against this kind of &quot;semi-JI&quot; meantone with pure 5:4&apos;s:<br/>              &quot;All the fifths are too narrow for my taste.&quot;</p><p>           2. Four major thirds including this odd near-pure fifth<br/>              will be ~6.07 cents wider than just, somewhat as in<br/>              2/11-comma meantone, about the limit in tastes for<br/>              regular 16th-century meantones (~392.38 cents).<br/>              These major thirds are built from 27 fifths down<br/>              rather than the usual 4 fifths up; when playing<br/>              them, we might recall Mark Lindley&apos;s comment that<br/>              1/5-comma meantone can be &quot;sprightly&quot; for some<br/>              English keyboard music around 1600.</p><p>           3. Three minor thirds will be ~6.07 narrower than<br/>              their regular meantone size (already ~5.38 cents<br/>              smaller than 6:5) -- in all, ~11.45 cents from<br/>              just, or ~304.19 cents. These minor thirds are<br/>              built from 28 fourths down rather than 3 fourths<br/>              up. Maybe we could promote these three thirds as<br/>              leaning a bit toward 19:16.</p><p>           4. Intervals built from longer chains of fifths,<br/>              such as the &quot;proximate minor thirds&quot; or &quot;neutral<br/>              thirds&quot; a diesis wider than minor (~11:9), and<br/>              the &quot;minimal seventh&quot; a diesis narrower than<br/>              minor (~7:4), will have two slightly different<br/>              &quot;flavors&quot; differing by ~6.07 cents.</p><p>In short, people seeking a 31-note circulating meantone temperament<br/>who like pure major thirds can happily stick to the Vicentino-Colonna<br/>tradition; people who like precise mathematical symmetry or<br/>intervallic consistency can go with the Rossi-Huyghens-Fokker<br/>tradition of 31-tet.</p><p>Similarly, the choice between Pythagorean 53 and 53-tet might be<br/>influenced by various factors, but either choice circulates.</p><p>Please let me add a disclaimer: my own involvement is mainly with<br/>noncirculating versions of Pythagorean and meantone with 12-24 notes.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=8899 href="#8899">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2000 8:56:50 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo!<br/>    I agree and feel this is an important point!
