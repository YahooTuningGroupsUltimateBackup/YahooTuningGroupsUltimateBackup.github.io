Darren?</p><p>Joe, at the time of your visit that was what I was using.  I now use VMCI<br/>which is part of Gabriel Moldonado&apos;s direct csound package.  I think it was<br/>$80 bucks.  It&apos;s _much_ better that midikeys, although $80 more expensive.<br/>It allows you to map midi note on messages, and any controller messages to<br/>the pc keyboard and mouse.  A cheesy alternative to the microzone but better<br/>than nothing.  I have my entire 8 by 16 matrix laid out and use it to step<br/>record in cakewalk, for improvising and for finding/hearing the various<br/>&quot;modulations&quot; inherent in the matrix.</p><p>Once again I would like to plug my latest software exploration, Geomaestro<br/>(free).  It operates from within keykit.  Basically, midievents are<br/>triggered by their relationship to geometric figures.  The developer is very<br/>willing to implement my various modifications and ideas, including<br/>converting the entire notename tables to ratios in the 15 limit diamond.</p><p>Darren</p></div>
