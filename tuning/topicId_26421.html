Two pure sine waves, say at 200 Hz and 300 Hz,<br/>heard together produce _no_ beats - only a primary difference tone at<br/>100 Hz, a sum tone at 500 Hz, and other very faint higher order<br/>products at multiples of 100 Hz.  These product tones only arise<br/>because of the non-linear amplitude response of the human ear.<br/>The &quot;beating&quot; of two tones will only be heard if the original tones<br/>have some harmonic overtones present (and therefore are _not_ sine<br/>waves).  In the above example, that would be between the 3rd harmonic<br/>of the 200 Hz tone, and the 2nd harmonic of the 300 Hz tone, both<br/>being at 600 Hz.  Of course, less than ideal oscillators, amplifiers,<br/>and headphones can introduce harmonic distortion which would account<br/>for the apparent beating of two &quot;sine waves&quot;.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Fred Reinagel</p></div><h3><a id=26528 href="#26528">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@carbon.cudenver.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2001 7:19:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Almost anyone, even without training, can tune two sine wave<br/>&gt; &gt; oscillators to a small number ratio by slowing the beats to a<br/>stop,<br/>&gt; &gt; but almost no one can tune a non just interval that way.<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t think so.

In connection with this<br/>discussion, I offer the following excerpt from an Appendix for a<br/>choral training workship I am developing that is mostly aimed at a<br/>cappella ensembles. It is necessarily a bit oversimplified in some<br/>its statements, but true enough to work as a reasonable explanatory<br/>support structure for the EXPERIENTIAL focus of the workshop. The<br/>excerpt follows:</p><p>Pleasing harmony has its basis in these three elements of acoustics:</p><p>1. The harmonic structure of a single musical tone<br/>2. The difference tones produced when two or more musical tones are<br/>sounded simultaneously<br/>3. The coherent alignment of the relationships that exist between<br/>these two aspects of harmonic structure.</p><p>Fortunately, this third element and fundamentally important<br/>requirement for pleasing harmony is satisfied by a single, simple<br/>condition:</p><p>Coherent alignment among all the elements of harmonic structure<br/>exists only when the frequencies (number of vibrations per second)<br/>between simultaneously sounded tones form a ratio expressible as<br/>simple whole numbers, such as 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, etc.</p><p>It is vitally important  for us to realize that this coherent<br/>alignment is INSTRINSICALLY pleasing to the human ear, and is not a<br/>merely subjective or conditioned phenomenon! The self-reinforcing<br/>order, efficiency, and organizing power of the coherence that<br/>characterizes laser light, for example, is even more directly,<br/>deeply, and intimately appreciated in sound by the human ear when it<br/>is emanating from a collection of human voices singing beautiful<br/>music. It reaches deep into the human spirit to integrate our<br/>perception, unify our feelings, inspire our hearts, order our minds,<br/>calm our bodies, and heal our souls. This is why both na&iuml;ve and<br/>seasoned listeners alike react to accurate intonation as sounding<br/>better, even if completely unaware of what underlies this<br/>superiority, and even if they would not have noticed its absence had<br/>it not been accurate.</p><p>Justly yours,</p><p>Bob<br/>Music Director<br/>Cantus Angelicus Choral Society<br/><a href="http://www.cangelic.org">http://www.cangelic.org</a></p><p>P.S. Anyone who pretends that 12t-ET is an arbitrary tonal convention<br/>with no basis in just intervals is not only ignoring the long history<br/>behinds its development and use, but the theoretical principles and<br/>traditional auditory methodology underlying its tuning. I once had a<br/>music theory professor, very erudite in some respects, who argued<br/>that scales and melodic/harmonic systems were arbitrary cultural<br/>conventions, naively pointing to the plethora of systems in actual<br/>use in various cultures.

My participation here has been truly inspiring and<br/>enlightening for me, and your contributions have figured very large<br/>in that indeed!</p><p>The statement below must be taken in context with the preceding<br/>sentence. I assume that you read that sentence, and so infer that<br/>perhaps you&apos;re unfamiliar with single side-band radio(SSB). I&apos;m a<br/>musician with a technical background, both sound and radio<br/>engineering, so I can assume too much at times.</p><p>Regular AM radio consists of modulating the amplitude of an otherwise<br/>steady state radio frequency signal with the audio signal to be<br/>transmitted. This generates sum and difference signals symmetrically<br/>above and below the carrier frequency. Two thirds of the transmitter<br/>power is spent in transmitting the carrier frequency, which has no<br/>useful information in it, but only serves as means for the<br/>information to ride &quot;piggyback&quot; on it. All useful information is in<br/>the sidebands.</p><p>Since the sidebands are identical except for the inversion of the<br/>audio spectrum with respect to the carrier frequency, they contain<br/>identical information. Eliminating one of them allows narrower tuning<br/>in the receiver, eliminating ambient radio frequency noise, so single<br/>SSB radio puts all the transmitter power into the information<br/>contained in one sideband. The SSB receiver reinserts the carrier<br/>with a small local sine-wave oscillator, which beats against the<br/>sideband information, and the difference signal is the original<br/>audio. The overall effect is about a 9 db gain in signal-to-noise<br/>ratio over conventional AM and vastly increased range for a given<br/>transmitter power.</p><p>HOWEVER, the local oscillator seldom tracks perfectly the original<br/>carrier frequency! This means that the speech signal (the only kind<br/>of signal for which this works passably well), is not accurately<br/>reconstructed in the receiver. If the local carrier reinsertion<br/>oscillator is 10 HZ off, this will add or subtract 10 Hz to the<br/>fundamental and every harmonic!</p><p>This will yield an overtone structure that is NOT harmonic, NOT exact<br/>whole number multiples of the fundamental since the error does not<br/>multiply with the order of the harmonic, but remains constant<br/>throughout the spectrum. This doesn&apos;t occur naturally to anything<br/>like this degree even with piano strings and their inharmonicity, not<br/>to mention the human voice, which as a rule is quite harmonically<br/>coherent.</p><p>I&apos;m simply stating that this phenomenon sounds weird and otherworldy<br/>to the even the crudest of ears, and differs not in principle but<br/>only in degree with the misalignment of subtones with the two or more<br/>musical tones that generate them in musical harmonic structures.<br/>Relatively simple whole number ratios between frequencies of musical<br/>fundamentals with reasonably harmonic overtones are the only<br/>conditions that produce good alignment and an overall effect of<br/>coherence among all the harmonic elements.</p><p>Hope this was not too arcane!</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It takes a subtler ear to<br/>&gt; &gt; notice when the tonal substructure generated by two simultaneous<br/>&gt; &gt; tones of rich harmonic content is not in such alignment with the<br/>&gt; &gt; tones generating it and their harmonics, BUT THE PRINCIPLE<br/>REMAINS<br/>&gt; &gt; THE SAME.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You lost me there.

The weird phenomenon of unnatural vocal &quot;inharmonic<br/>harmonics&quot; that occurs when SSB is MISTUNED sounds so weird to us<br/>because it is a misalignment of the harmonic structure which,<br/>although it is very orderly, consistent, and mathematically simple,<br/>it is nonetheless a way that one never hears in naturally occurring<br/>overtone structures.</p><p>Now if one tunes a just 3:2 P5, the principal subtone generated is a<br/>difference frequency at 1, an octave below the bottom note of the P5.<br/>Assuming harmonic overtones for the source tones, this so-called<br/>differential tone doesn&apos;t exist as a pure sine wave, but has an<br/>overtone structure resulting from the difference tones of all the<br/>harmonics in the two tones generating it, as well as the harmonic<br/>structure imposed by the ear&apos;s non-linearity responsible for the<br/>difference tones, not to mention neurological phenomena that also<br/>contribute to it.</p><p>In this justly tuned P5, the difference tone and all its harmonics<br/>are coherently related, dovetailing perfectly and reinforcing each<br/>other. If we mistune the fifth slightly, the difference tone shifts<br/>and it&apos;s harmonic structure is no longer in alignment with either the<br/>fundamentals of the two generating tones or their harmonics.</p><p>Although this phenomenon is sadly quite available in nature, most<br/>notably at many concert performances organized by well-meaning human<br/>beings, it is still not pleasing to sensitive, musical ears for<br/>essentially the same reasons that the SSB phenomenon sounds weird<br/>even to the crudest, most untrained and unmusical ears. At bottom, it<br/>is not so much a matter of difference in kind, but rather in degree.<br/>Hope this clarifies the point. If not, please let me know<br/>specifically what aspect is not clear so I know what to address.</p><p>Paul had also said:<br/>Inharmonic timbres are fascinating and lots of great music can be<br/>made with them, but they can never match the immediate sense of<br/>&quot;coherence&quot; one gets from harmonic timbres.</p><p>Bob answers:<br/>Since I work in practice with a cappella singers, my discussion<br/>assumes a high degree of harmonicity in the overtone structure.</p><p>Paul also had said:<br/>By the way, Bob, you never responded to my assertion that JI may not<br/>always maximize consonance, e.g., for chords like CEGAD. Any response?</p><p>Bob answers:<br/>Sorry, Paul! CEGAD has quartal structure coexisting with triadic. For<br/>quartal structures, Pythagorean JI works up to a point, but 12 ET<br/>works better in this instance because ET is a more or less reasonable<br/>compromise between quartal and triadic structures, although I<br/>wouldn&apos;t argue that it absolutely represents the least harmonically<br/>entropic tuning.</p><p>I do believe that is why some of the richer jazz structures one hears<br/>in &quot;comping&quot; on the piano has evolved into stacked fourths that<br/>contain all the elements of extended triads. For example, Eb A D G C<br/>F in ET works harmonically very nicely in place of the more<br/>conventional F A C EB G D (a minor 7th chord extended with a Major<br/>9th and a Major 13th).</p><p>I&apos;m not sure this is the kind of answer you were looking for, Paul,<br/>but<br/>it&apos;s my best take on it.</p><p>Thanks for asking!</p><p>- Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The statement below must be taken in context with the preceding<br/>&gt; &gt; sentence.

Any<br/>response?</p><p>Bob elaborates previous answer:<br/>Paul, it occurred to me that I should have been more explicit about<br/>one point. C E G A D can be arrange as consecutive perfect fifths<br/>from C (C G D A E). These are the self-same core pitches that are<br/>used to set the temperament in quarter-comma meantone. Tuning the C<br/>and E as a 5:4 just Major 3rd, then shaving a quarter syntonic comma<br/>off of each fifth sets this temperament. The rest can be derived by<br/>tuning just Major 3rds to these reference pitches.</p><p>Without this or some kind of temperament, the syntonic comma will<br/>simply get shifted around in any just tuning, but won&apos;t go away no<br/>matter what you do. Even strings with only four open string pitches<br/>have this problem. Traditionally, string players tune the open string<br/>fifths justly. This will always produce an octave and a Major sixth<br/>interval between the top and bottom strings that is sharp by the<br/>syntonic comma to a just Major sixth. Its inversion, the minor 3rd,<br/>will be flat by the same amount.</p><p>Interestingly, the chord in the spelling you gave is a common final<br/>chord in some jazz and other earlier pop styles. I do not believe<br/>this<br/>usage would have ever evolved musically without a tempered scale<br/>environment.</p><p>Thanks for the interesting (and perhaps, chuckle, deliberately<br/>loaded?) question, Paul!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Bob</p><p>P.S. Concerning the derivation of the name &quot;meantone&quot; for this<br/>temperament, please note this interesting observation for the most<br/>elegantly simple version, the quarter-comma. Since the comma division<br/>is symmetrical around D in this tuning (assuming C-based tuning), the<br/>temperament for D should be set first. After tuning C and E as a just<br/>5:4 M3, you can set the temperament for D by:</p><p>1) tuning A a Perfect 4th above E (and consequently a just M6 above C<br/>if you want to double check)</p><p>2) tuning G a Perfect 5th above C</p><p>3) tuning D a Perfect 5th below the just A</p><p>4) play the D against the just G (it will be flat to the G by a<br/>synontic comma)</p><p>5) Observe the beat rate</p><p>6) Raise the D till the beat rate is half the initial rate</p><p>This sets the tempered D. Now the two remaining tempered core<br/>pitches, G and A, are tuned as mean pitches between C and D, then D<br/>and E respectively, by an analogous procedure.</p><p>*!*!*!*!*!*!  NOTE THE FOLLOWING: All three notes are tempered as<br/>MEANS between two pitches, and not just the D. All other pitches from<br/>Eb to G#, or wherever else you want to place the &quot;wolf&quot; fifth<br/>(actually a diminished 6th or its inversion, an augmented 3rd), can<br/>be tuned as just 5:4 Major 3rds to these core pitches.</p><p>This simplest and most elegantly symmetrical mother of all the other<br/>meantone temperaments has two difficulites beyond the limits it<br/>imposes on harmonic modulation:</p><p>1) Unlike 12-EDO, it does not order the degree of pitch error to<br/>align with the order of the intervalic primes. In ET, the fifths are<br/>almost just, the Major 3rds next (as bad as they may be), etc., so<br/>the most dissonant intervals are also the least accurate. Quarter-<br/>comma meantone has the fifths more than twice as mistuned as ET, but<br/>Major 3rds are perfect, inverting the order of primacy for the<br/>intervals.</p><p>2) Further, quarter-comma has diatonic half-steps 5.5 cents wider<br/>than the already fat (to modern ears) diatonic half-steps of JI. The<br/>narrow chromatic half-steps of JI are further narrowed by 5.5 cents.<br/>This has mostly a melodic significance, but not a completely<br/>negligible one.</p><p>These weaknesses seem to have bothered some quarter-comma users<br/>enough to seek other variants of meantone, many of which did little<br/>or nothing to extend the range of clean modulations, but rather<br/>shifted some of the pitch error of the perfect 5ths and minor 3rds to<br/>the Major 3rds, narrowing the diatonic half-steps and widening the<br/>chromatic half-steps in the bargain.</p></div><h3><a id=26968 href="#26968">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2001 3:55:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Bob Wendell, I understood your clarificiation perfectly, and agree.</p><p>You then wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul had also said:<br/>&gt; Inharmonic timbres are fascinating and lots of great music can be<br/>&gt; made with them, but they can never match the immediate sense of<br/>&gt; &quot;coherence&quot; one gets from harmonic timbres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob answers:<br/>&gt; Since I work in practice with a cappella singers, my discussion<br/>&gt; assumes a high degree of harmonicity in the overtone structure.</p><p>Well, perfect harmonicity, to the extent that that is well-defined<br/>for samples of finite length.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul also had said:<br/>&gt; By the way, Bob, you never responded to my assertion that JI may<br/>not<br/>&gt; always maximize consonance, e.g., for chords like CEGAD. Any<br/>response?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob answers:<br/>&gt; Sorry, Paul! CEGAD has quartal structure coexisting with triadic.<br/>For<br/>&gt; quartal structures, Pythagorean JI works up to a point, but 12 ET<br/>&gt; works better in this instance because ET is a more or less<br/>reasonable<br/>&gt; compromise between quartal and triadic structures, although I<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t argue that it absolutely represents the least harmonically<br/>&gt; entropic tuning.</p><p>I agree that ET is better than Pythagorean or 5-limit JI in this<br/>case. Some form of meantone is probably even better.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do believe that is why some of the richer jazz structures one<br/>hears<br/>&gt; in &quot;comping&quot; on the piano has evolved into stacked fourths that<br/>&gt; contain all the elements of extended triads. For example, Eb A D G<br/>C<br/>&gt; F in ET works harmonically very nicely in place of the more<br/>&gt; conventional F A C EB G D (a minor 7th chord extended with a Major<br/>&gt; 9th and a Major 13th).</p><p>Umm . . . you mean a dominant seventh chord? Actually, we had quite<br/>an interesting discussion on the tuning of a dominant seventh chord<br/>with added 9th, 13th, and sharp 11th a while back. Monz made a<br/>webpage with some of the suggested tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure this is the kind of answer you were looking for, Paul,<br/>&gt; but<br/>&gt; it&apos;s my best take on it.</p><p>Sounds like we&apos;re in agreement, yet again!</p></div><h3><a id=26984 href="#26984">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2001 6:12:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Interestingly, the chord in the spelling you gave is a common final<br/>&gt; chord in some jazz and other earlier pop styles.

In fact, 2/7-comma meantone was favored at one<br/>point (when meantone was first mathematically described), primacy<br/>being given to both major and minor thirds over fifths. However, by<br/>the late Baroque era and through most of the Classical, 55-tET and<br/>1/6-comma meantone were deemed more desirable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) Further, quarter-comma has diatonic half-steps 5.5 cents wider<br/>&gt; than the already fat (to modern ears) diatonic half-steps of JI.</p><p>&quot;To modern ears&quot; is the key phrase. Most likely in the Renaissance,<br/>the importance of incisive leading tones (both ascending and<br/>descending) was rather lessened due to the non-tonal, often<br/>panconsonant harmonic language. Then, after the advent of tonality,<br/>incisive leading tones became the grammatical key to tonal meaning in<br/>the music -- thus the move to 1/6-comma meantone.</p></div><h3><a id=27007 href="#27007">ðŸ”—</a>BobWendell@technet-inc.com</h3><span>8/14/2001 8:22:32 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bob had said:<br/>*!*!*!*!*!*!

Perhaps you missed the elaboration I followed up with later?<br/>I repeat it here for everyone&apos;s convenience:</p><p>Bob elaborates previous answer:<br/>Paul, it occurred to me that I should have been more explicit about<br/>one point. C E G A D can be arrange as consecutive perfect fifths<br/>from C (C G D A E). These are the self-same core pitches that are<br/>used to set the temperament in quarter-comma meantone. Tuning the C<br/>and E as a 5:4 just Major 3rd, then shaving a quarter syntonic comma<br/>off of each fifth sets this temperament. The rest can be derived by<br/>tuning just Major 3rds to these reference pitches.<br/>Without this or some kind of temperament, the syntonic comma will<br/>simply get shifted around in any just tuning, but won&apos;t go away no<br/>matter what you do.
