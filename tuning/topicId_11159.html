Oh yes, of course, I did know that the 17<br/>tones per octave was NOT 17t-ET.  That was as much a typing as a<br/>&quot;thinking&quot; error this time...</p><p>I wonder just how much &quot;neo-Gothic&quot; expansion of the fifths the people<br/>of the Medieval time would have tolerated in their music, before<br/>considering it &quot;out of tune,&quot; in their world, since you so clearly<br/>explain in your writings the variability of many of the practices,<br/>particularly the size of the thirds...</p><p>I suppose we will never know, unless we were to &quot;time travel,&quot; since, as<br/>you have repeatedly shown in many of your writings, the PERCEPTION of<br/>intervals and CONTEXT changes through the ages... even if the actual<br/>empirical intervals were to remain the same! (or at least this is what I<br/>have been getting from some of the posts)</p><p>Thanks so much again!!</p><p>___________ _____ ___ __<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
