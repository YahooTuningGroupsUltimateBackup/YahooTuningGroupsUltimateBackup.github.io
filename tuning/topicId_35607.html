Well, apparently<br/>chords *will* work, but only if they all have quartertones ie. either<br/>ALL quartertones up and down simultaneously (up to 4 voices.)</p><p>My impression is that this will not work for chords made up of<br/>*different* microtones other than the quartertone or or chords<br/>comprised of *both* &quot;regular&quot; semitones and quartertones.  (That&apos;s<br/>what they say, too...)</p><p>I don&apos;t believe it would be accurate for chords containing, say a 6th<br/>of a tone up *and* a 6th of a tone down simultaneously, since I was<br/>finding different values for those in my experimentation...</p><p>Hopefully, that is a limitation they will &quot;improve upon&quot; some day.<br/>They seem to still be developing this product daily.  I think if they<br/>get repeated input from microtonal composers, more will happen.</p><p>So everybody should write to them, visit the &quot;chat&quot; group, etc. and<br/>urge them to &quot;refine&quot; these things.</p><p>But, at least the software *WILL* play back various kinds of<br/>microtones, at least monophonically...</p><p>If the line is Monophonic per Midi channel, then you could adapt the<br/>sibelius plugin to add other pitch bends, for your own accidentals,<br/>if you want to play with your own font.</p><p>***Yes, and other people have already designed some, like Ted Mook&apos;s<br/>PostScript fonts for the Ezra Sims accidentals.  I&apos;m having no<br/>problems with those in Sibelius, but one must remember to install<br/>Adobe Type Manager first, or they won&apos;t work!  :)</p><p>Sibelius doen&apos;t support too many<br/>&gt; accidentals as default and font writing is very specalised.

However,<br/>since the definition of the 72-tET system I&apos;m using is only 3 cents,<br/>anyway, I guess that isn&apos;t *too* much of a sacrifice.</p><p>Gee.. I hope none of the performers uses any *VIBRATO*.... !</p><p>***Oh... by the way, it&apos;s *FOUR* 12-tET semitones that constitutes<br/>the range divided by 128 or *two* whole tones = 400/128 = 3 cents, as<br/>you have above.</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>jp</p></div>
