It is something that my body seems to<br/>&gt; reject. Don&apos;t know how else to explain it - but I approach any music<br/>&gt; with a totally open mind; without preconceptions, and I actively<br/>&gt; listen to and play myriad of styles of music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I realize that is so subjective, but I feel more and more compelled<br/>&gt; these days to listen to what my &quot;inner ear&quot; tells me. It&apos;s a &quot;body&quot;<br/>&gt; thing, and very difficult to explain. It all leads to the questions<br/>&gt; and points I address (clarification prompted by your reply) in my<br/>&gt; above clarification - that of enduring qualities of music, which I&apos;m<br/>&gt; hyper-sensitive about being a very personal and subjective reality<br/>&gt; for any individual composer. As one could easily infer from my<br/>&gt; clarification on this topic, I would never denigrate anyone else&apos;s<br/>&gt; perspective, because I know theirs is as important to them as mine is<br/>&gt; to me. Strangely though, I find on some levels that there is much<br/>&gt; common ground about these things, which I see all the time coming<br/>&gt; forward from my interactions with composers around the world. I do<br/>&gt; see that others listen to their inner voices and their body for<br/>&gt; signals about music which is correct for their unique and individual<br/>&gt; purposes.</p><p>I&apos;m right there with ya.  About 6 years ago I was listening mostly to grunge, Soundgarden being my<br/>favorite band at that time, but also Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and that whole northern West Coast scene.<br/>I previously had no interest in medieval music; but I read an interview in MIX magazine of the<br/>engineer who recorded Anonymous 4&apos;s then new album &quot;The Lily and the Lamb.&quot;  I thought it sounded<br/>intriguing from a sonic perspective - music recorded in real time direct to stereo in a real<br/>acoustic environment, with no artificial processing added - completely the opposite of my world of<br/>close-miked multitrack overdubs in dead rooms, relying heavily on EQ and digital reverb to get the<br/>&quot;sound.&quot;  I mentioned it offhand to my wife, who promptly went out and purchased a copy.</p><p>So I taped it and started listening to it from time to time in the car.  A strange thing happened.<br/>After listening a little while, then going back to grunge, I found that I had gained a sensitivity<br/>to what music was doing inside of me.  The grunge was tearing me apart inside, attacking my soul<br/>and spirit.  The pain of it, as I eventually recognized, was being masked by the adrenaline rush<br/>that type of music provides.  When I put the chant tape back in, it began to heal me.  Once I<br/>recognized what was happening, it didn&apos;t take me long to break my addiction to the grunge rush and<br/>begin feeding my spirit more regularly with medieval and early Renaissance music.  Since then I&apos;ve<br/>gained an increasing awareness of the effects of music on my spirit.</p><p>I&apos;m not one to buy the line that rock music is inherently evil.  I still do a lot of recording of<br/>it, some listening to it, and a little writing of it.  There are some groups whose music doesn&apos;t<br/>seem destructive to me for the most part (Yes, Pink Floyd, The Cranberries, Harry Connick&apos;s funky<br/>stuff, etc.).  But it seems to be getting more rare on pop radio these days.</p><p>Unfortunately, many of the guys on the Tuning List are either atheist or agnostic, utterly<br/>materialist in their cosmology, so they don&apos;t even believe there is such a thing as a soul or<br/>spirit.  That makes it difficult to engage in a discussion with them on this topic.  There is also<br/>the prevailing attitude that there are no moral absolutes, so that music which is bad for one<br/>person may be good for another - further, that there is really no such thing as Good and Bad at<br/>all.  Obviously, that makes it even harder to discuss what makes for good music.  But it&apos;s worth a<br/>try.  As more evidence accumulates, it will become increasingly difficult for them to deny the<br/>transcendent nature at the core of humanity.</p><p>Thanks for keeping the spirit alive!</p><p>--<br/>David J.
