And<br/>&gt; the one with more?<br/>I&apos;d say, just off the top of my head, that a *Western* flute has the<br/>fewest. For the most *harmonics*, probably a reed organ or a synthesizer.<br/>For the most *inharmonic partials*, I&apos;ll guess cymbals.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; And how many harmonics are normally audible on a musical instrument?<br/>&gt;<br/>What is audible depends on two things: the amplitudes and frequencies of<br/>the harmonics. Generally, the human ear can hear between 16 and 20000<br/>Hertz. Low amplitude harmonics in that frequency reange won;t be heard<br/>either.</p><p>&gt; Do you know some web site where I can find this information?<br/>&gt;<br/>I don;t know about web sites, but there are quite a few books on acoustics<br/>of musical instruments.<br/>--<br/><a href="mailto:znmeb@teleport.com">znmeb@teleport.com</a> (M.

I<br/>also recall that harmonics of piano strings in a certain register are<br/>audible through the 50th, and they get more and more stretches; the 50th is<br/>stretched by like 5% (a minor second) above its harmonic series pitch.</p></div>
