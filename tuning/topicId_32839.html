For the 2000 Microstock concert, I composed and performed a<br/>solo guitar piece on fretless electric, which used a tuning of 1/1, 5/4,<br/>3/2, 7/4, 35/32, and 21/16. Once I had the tuning, I started looking for<br/>motifs, by ear, and after about a year, a whole flood of ideas came to<br/>me, some of which I used in the piece. I will eventually record this<br/>music, a bit further down the road. My point is this...although I can<br/>find and play the riffs which belong to this piece, I don&apos;t have a clue<br/>about what notes I&apos;m playing, in an intellectual sense...nor, at this<br/>point, do I care. If you asked me to notate it, I would be in big<br/>trouble. Yet, I can play it, and the melodies, in places, are quite<br/>specific. I&apos;m sure not saying that notation is  bad, as it definitely<br/>fosters communication between musicians who are trying to play a common<br/>score...and, if I ever wanted others to play this piece with me, as in<br/>unison lines, perhaps writing it out would be very helpful, needless to<br/>say. I have always been, and still am fascinated with, the more non<br/>intellectual forms of music, especially blues, where it&apos;s done by feel<br/>and intuition. I don&apos;t know how it&apos;s done, but it is...that&apos;s why art,<br/>itself, is so amazing...it doesn&apos;t need to be talked about, or theorized<br/>about...it is somehow brought into the physical world, from somewhere,<br/>and no one knows how...Hstick<br/>(BTW, I can write music in 12 eq if need be...I have a whole bunch of<br/>solo guitar pieces sitting around, and of course I wrote out &quot;Mysteries&quot;<br/>for Hoogewerf...)</p></div>
