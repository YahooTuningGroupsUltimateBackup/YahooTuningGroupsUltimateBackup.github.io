They are &quot;brought down mathematically&quot; to<br/>be within the scope of human hearing. I think of this as tempering the<br/>harmonic series, in a way...we are not actually hearing the REAL note,<br/>we are hearing a lower octave representation of that pitch. It would be<br/>fascinating if human hearing was broader, and we could hear those real<br/>high pitches...but, we can&apos;t. I like to keep that in mind as I listen to<br/>music that uses these unhearable intervals...Hstick</p></div>
