In the 16th century, as now, one<br/>theorist could assert that classic JI was the rule for voices, another<br/>would offer a demonstration of its impossibility, and a third would<br/>advocate the kind of scheme which Erlich has termed &quot;adaptive JI.&quot;</p><p>First, a semantic but for me nontrivial matter of definition. As a<br/>medievalist, I regard Pythagorean intonation as one form of JI, a form<br/>providing a framework for Continental European polyphony during the<br/>varied era of about 850-1450 -- or 850-1400, if we treat the early<br/>15th century as a kind of special transitional period leading to<br/>meantone for keyboards and 5-limit JI (at least in the ideal) for<br/>voices.</p><p>If JI means a system where all intervals are defined as integer<br/>ratios, and all stable concords (in styles like those of medieval<br/>part-music where &quot;stable/unstable&quot; is a useful contrast) are realized<br/>as &quot;low-integer&quot; ratios, then Pythagorean tuning could be a paradigm<br/>case of a robust JI system.</p><p>Thus I would say that the first 550 or 600 years of composed European<br/>polyphony were based on 3-limit JI -- not a bad track record.</p><p>The early 15th century (maybe starting in areas such as Florence a bit<br/>earlier, 1370 or 1380) represents, at least on keyboards, a special<br/>kind of JI approach exploiting the contrast in Pythagorean tuning<br/>between regular thirds and sixths (e.g. M3 at 81:64, m3 at 32:27) and<br/>what are now often termed &quot;schisma&quot; intervals a Pythagorean comma<br/>narrower or wider (e.g. d4 at 8192:6561, ~5:4; A2 at 19683:16384,<br/>~6:5). Since the tuning is still derived from integer ratios, with all<br/>regular octaves, fifths, and fourths pure, it is still 3-limit JI.</p><p>From an aesthetic viewpoint, I would prefer to describe this as<br/>modified 3-limit rather than 5-limit, because regular Pythagorean<br/>thirds and sixths remain the rule for intervals not involving written<br/>sharps (e.g. A3-C#4, realized as A3-Db4) -- I use C4 for middle C, and<br/>higher numbers to show higher octaves. Mark Lindley speaks of &quot;modal<br/>color&quot; contrasts analogous to the &quot;key color&quot; contrasts of unequal<br/>well-temperaments of the 18th-19th centuries, and I have proposed for<br/>the 17-note Pythagorean tunings (Gb-A#) proposed in the early 15th<br/>century by Prosdocimus of Beldemandis and Ugolino of Orvieto the term<br/>&quot;well-untemperament.&quot; This may be a technically inexact usage, since<br/>the chain of fifths remains open, but may suggest an ample gamut with<br/>alluring contrasts of color.</p><p>Incidentally, to distinguish this type of early 15th-century tuning<br/>from certain schemes (e.g. Helmholtz/Ellis) which seek _consistently_<br/>near-pure thirds and sixths, I would propose the medieval Latin<br/>spelling &quot;schismatic&quot; for the first type of tuning, and the<br/>Helmholtz/Ellis spelling &quot;skhismatic&quot; for the second.</p><p>By the later 15th century on the Continent -- and possibly also<br/>through much of the medieval era in at least some parts of England --<br/>we appear to enter a period when tertian JI (pure thirds as well as<br/>fifths) does define the ideal for voices and other non-fixed-pitch<br/>instruments. The &quot;simplified&quot; monochord of Ramos (1482), with its<br/>5-limit tuning, is one possible landmark.</p><p>In my view the novelty here is not JI -- deriving intervals from<br/>integer ratios, and seeking the purest tunings for stable concords --<br/>but the application of these ideals to a new musical style (especially<br/>on the Continent) where thirds and sixths are among the full or stable<br/>concords.</p><p>While Ramos set a possible precedent with his monochord of 1482,<br/>16th-century theorists such as Fogliano and Zarlino championed the<br/>syntonic diatonic of Ptolemy with its unequal 9:8 and 10:9 whole-tones<br/>as the natural intonation for unaccompanied voices.</p><p>Granted that a 5-limit system based exclusively on such integer ratios<br/>runs into such complications as impure fifths and fourths (the<br/>syntonic comma problem) and comma shifts or drifting pitches, this<br/>does not mean that for all musics it is as impossible a task as<br/>squaring the circle.</p><p>Using a 15-note tuning based on a keyboard instrument described by<br/>Zarlino (with two versions a syntonic comma apart of D, Bb, and F#), I<br/>have performed some straightforward 16th-century pieces with pleasure,<br/>and without any obviously insuperable difficulties. This included<br/>pieces requiring me to move between two manuals, one with a just fifth<br/>G-D and the other with a just D-A; while I was quite engaged in<br/>placing my hands on the right manuals at the right time, any comma<br/>shifts did not distress me.</p><p>As Zarlino and other theorists favoring JI for voices and other<br/>non-fixed-pitch instruments recognize, JI for keyboards is an<br/>experimental technique, and meantone temperaments are generally much<br/>less complicated for the player to manage. However, it&apos;s a kind of<br/>experimentation that I&apos;d highly recommend, not as a substitute for<br/>meantone but as a fascinating and moving experience in its own right.</p><p>In a recent article on &quot;Pythagoras at the forge: tuning in early<br/>music,&quot; in _Companion to Medieval and Renaissance Music_, ed. Tess<br/>Knighton and David Fallows (New York, Schirmer Books, 1992),<br/>pp. 316-326, Rogers Covey-Crump suggests that many vocal consorts<br/>&quot;tend towards Mean Tone tuning, but the best performers, when<br/>thoroughly rehearsed, are capable of Just or Pythagorean tuning.&quot;  He<br/>recommends Pythagorean for most medieval styles through Machaut and<br/>his late 14th-century successors, and Just (i.e. 5-limit) for<br/>Renaissance music. For some English or Anglo-Norman medieval styles of<br/>the 13th and 14th centuries, he notes the possibility of &quot;alternative<br/>or mixed tunings of thirds&quot; which might lean toward a kind of 5-limit<br/>JI (as suggested around 1300 by Walter Odington).</p><p>At the same time, he observes (like Paul Erlich here) that &quot;tuning is<br/>mainly about vertical chording and not about solo melodic lines,&quot; and<br/>that &quot;consistency of interval size ... is a feature of the best<br/>western European singers.&quot;</p><p>This suggests that either Renaissance or 20th-century singers<br/>approaching the 16th-century repertory may in fact be doing at least<br/>some adaptive JI with tempering of melodic intervals.</p><p>One 16th-century theorist, Giovanni Battista Benedetti (c. 1563),<br/>argued that comma drift made 5-limit JI impossible in practice for<br/>voices, and proposed a system of temperament which Claude Palisca has<br/>interpreted as 12-tone equal temperament (12-tet).</p><p>Interestingly, Vincenzo Galilei concluded in the 1580&apos;s that<br/>unaccompanied singers favored neither 3-limit nor 5-limit JI, but<br/>rather a form of temperament with unequal semitones (unlike 12-tet on<br/>lutes) but equal whole-tones, rather resembling that of keyboards, for<br/>which he recommended a 2/7-comma tuning like that favored by Zarlino.</p><p>However, from an adaptive JI viewpoint, Nicola Vicentino&apos;s alternative<br/>tuning for his 36-note archicembalo (1555) presents a kind of<br/>synthesis of the opposed viewpoints later expressed by Zarlino and<br/>Benedetti or Galilei.</p><p>Describing the common practice as &quot;tempered and mixed music,&quot; and<br/>basing the tuning of the first 19 notes of his instrument on usual<br/>meantone (likely 1/4-comma with pure major thirds), he directed that<br/>the 17 notes of his second manual should be tuned in perfect fifths<br/>with those of the first manual. The result, assuming a basic 1/4-comma<br/>temperament, would be sonorities with pure fifths and minor thirds, as<br/>well as major thirds, if the performer can reach the appropriate keys<br/>on both manuals simultaneously.</p><p>While Vicentino&apos;s advice to singers to rely on his instrument for<br/>finding their intervals would most obviously apply to his first tuning<br/>with 31 notes arranged to divide the octave into more or less equal<br/>dieses or fifthtones (the remaining 5 notes used for adaptive JI for a<br/>few frequent sonorities), it could also apply to this second tuning.<br/>In other words, singers might have emulated this tuning to realize a<br/>kind of JI based on melodic intervals at or very close to those of<br/>1/4-comma meantone, the general variety of tuning which Galilei later<br/>suggested that unaccompanied singers tend to practice.</p><p>(From a melodic standpoint, one might argue that 1/4-comma would be a<br/>somewhat preferable model to 2/7-comma, since it permits wider<br/>whole-tones and narrower diatonic semitones.)</p><p>From the viewpoint of practical composition, the issue of classic<br/>vs. adaptive JI for voices (or either model vs. keyboard meantone)<br/>might not have much observable impact. Zarlino does say that certain<br/>parallel progressions between imperfect consonances (thirds and<br/>sixths) may have some redeeming variety because of the different sizes<br/>of whole-steps, but generally such distinctions might be considered<br/>details of performance rather than composition.</p><p>However close the &quot;just&quot; vocal intonation of the 16th century may have<br/>been to the classic model of Zarlino (based on Ptolemy&apos;s syntonic<br/>diatonic) or the adaptive tuning of Vicentino, an interesting<br/>discussion showing both the continued recognition of Zarlino&apos;s model<br/>in the 18th century and the need for some flexibility in its<br/>application appears in Johann Philipp Kirnberger&apos;s treatise of 1771,<br/>_The Art of Strict Musical Composition_, tr. David Beach and Jurgen<br/>Thym (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982).</p><p>In a discussion of &quot;Scales and Temperament,&quot; pp. 20-21, in which he<br/>rejects 12-tet for keyboards as harming &quot;the diversity of keys,&quot;<br/>Kirnberger also notes that in vocal intonation, &quot;entirely pure melodic<br/>progressions in two parts produce various tempered or not quite pure<br/>harmonic thirds.&quot;</p><p>Maintaining that melodic fourths and fifths &quot;cannot be sung other than<br/>pure,&quot; he gives an example, which I notate as if in 2/2 although it<br/>might be read in 4/4 also:</p><p>1  &amp;  2  &amp;  | 1  ||<br/>C5 G4 D5<br/>C5       F4   Bb4</p><p>Here each note is sustained until the next note in that part or the<br/>end of the example, a convention that avoids the complications of ties<br/>in ASCII.</p><p>The two parts begin at a unison, and melodic motions in the upper part<br/>of a pure fourth down and pure fifth up necessarily place it at a 9:8<br/>major second above the lower part. From this point, Kirnberger shows<br/>that the melodic motions of a pure fifth down and a pure fourth up in<br/>the lower voice must result in a concluding vertical major third<br/>Bb4-D5 of 81:64 rather than 5:4.  Although this third is a syntonic<br/>comma larger than pure, &quot;it is not to be discarded for that reason.&quot;<br/>In his view, the just tuning of melodic fourths and fifths must take<br/>precedence, especially in vocal music.</p><p>While concluding that &quot;progressions by pure intervals result in thirds<br/>that are sometimes larger and sometimes smaller,&quot; ibid. at p. 21,<br/>Kirnberger nevertheless states in his discussion of &quot;The Scale, and<br/>the Keys and Modes Derived from It&quot; that &quot;[t]he basis of the tone system<br/>currently in use throughout Europe&quot; is &quot;the basic diatonic scale<br/>... said not to have come into use until Zarlino&apos;s time.&quot; (p. 315).</p><p>This is indeed Zarlino&apos;s syntonic diatonic, and Kirnberger remarks<br/>that &quot;before him the steps had these older Greek proportions,&quot; and<br/>gives the ratios for a standard Pythagorean tuning.</p><p>If we define &quot;JI&quot; to include Pythagorean in a medieval context as well<br/>as 5-limit in a Renaissance-Classic context, then both of Kirnberger&apos;s<br/>basic diatonic scales are instances of just tuning.</p><p>To conclude, I would agree with Dave Hill that both 3-limit and<br/>5-limit JI have been immensely influential in the European tradition<br/>of composition, while at the same time recognizing (along with Nicola<br/>Vicentino and Paul Erlich) the appeal of adaptive 5-limit JI.</p><p>On a personal note, I might add that while playing a keyboard in<br/>classic 5-limit JI is an exacting experience, it is also a unique one,<br/>and that I do not find unequal 9:8 and 10:9 whole-tones unpleasant. At<br/>least for some music some of the time, this experience is not only<br/>possible but most rewarding.</p><p>For me, &quot;playing in JI&quot; means especially 3-limit or Pythagorean, a<br/>tuning system with five or six centuries of repertory including the<br/>awesome polyphony of composers such as Leonin, Perotin and Machaut.<br/>If we follow the definition of JI advocated here, then this is the one<br/>JI system which has won acceptance as a standard keyboard tuning.</p><p>Finally, I might suggest a pragmatic study of intonation as practiced,<br/>for example, by vocal groups famed for their &quot;just&quot; tuning of<br/>16th-century music. Would we find some approximation of Zarlino&apos;s<br/>syntonic diatonic, or of a Vicentino/Erlich adaptive tuning, or<br/>something else?</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
