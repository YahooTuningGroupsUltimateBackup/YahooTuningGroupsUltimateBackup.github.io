Here I focus on Solage, this article turning<br/>out to be long enough on that subject alone.</p><p>For readers who might find this article (about 300 lines) more than<br/>long enough, I&apos;ve stated a summary of my views in the first section.</p><p>---------------------------------------------<br/>1. Divergent views of Solage: a quick summary<br/>---------------------------------------------</p><p>First of all, as a medievalist, I&apos;d like to emphasize that it is a<br/>positive and encouraging step when people such as Walter Mathieu<br/>include medieval and Renaissance music in general discussions of<br/>tuning. In such discussions, each author may take a different<br/>viewpoint, and there&apos;s no requirement that such viewpoints must always<br/>agree. Different viewpoints, analyses, and performance interpretations<br/>give the reader or listener a choice, and invite further exploration<br/>and dialogue.</p><p>In fact, Mathieu&apos;s book _The Harmonic Experience_ has given me the<br/>idea of maybe writing a kind of intonational guide to medieval and<br/>Renaissance/Manneristic music, with an emphasis on Pythagorean and<br/>meantone tunings, including pieces using or (arguably) inviting more<br/>than 12 notes per octave.</p><p>Mathieu, in contrast, seems to me to be focusing mainly on two<br/>deliberately contrasting approaches to harmony and tuning: 5-limit or<br/>higher just intonation (JI), with a lot of focus on the music of<br/>India, and 12-tone equal temperament (12-tet).</p><p>While he does discuss the Pythagorean or 3-limit intervals, and also<br/>medieval music, the medieval European practice and theory of<br/>verticality seems to me to be somewhat peripheral to his main focus.<br/>Inevitably, one takes a viewpoint, and my viewpoint on a piece such as<br/>Solage&apos;s _Fumeux fume_ may be quite different from Mathieu&apos;s.</p><p>To resolve rather than prolong the suspense for people who might want<br/>a quick statement of my own views on _Fumeux fumee_, I regard it as a<br/>masterpiece of late Gothic 3-limit or trinic verticality, and also a<br/>piece inviting extended Pythagorean tuning with 15 notes per octave<br/>(Gb-G#). Such a work at once exemplifies and transcends the theory of<br/>the 14th and early 15th centuries, just as Beethoven or Wagner at once<br/>fulfills and transcends 18th-19th century theory.</p><p>Solage&apos;s piece has been familiar to me as a listener for about 30<br/>years, and I would say that if I wanted to pick a piece of Continental<br/>European music from around 1400 suggesting tertian or &quot;5-limit&quot;<br/>leanings, _Fumeux fume_ would not be my obvious choice. I might<br/>nominate a piece such as Vaillant&apos;s _Tres doulz amis_, which has a<br/>smoothly flowing texture featuring lots of sonorities with thirds or<br/>sixths.</p><p>In fact, Valliant&apos;s piece occurred to me when I read Oliver<br/>Ellsworth&apos;s interpretation of a treatise in the Berkeley Manuscript or<br/>Paris Anonymous (part of it dated 1375) as proposing 19-tet; the<br/>treatise on singing semitones describes a division of the tone into<br/>three parts, with a usual diatonic semitone of 2/3-tone and a narrow<br/>cadential semitone of 1/3-tone. If one were going to try out a 19-tet<br/>interpretation of the treatise on a late medieval piece, _Tres doulz<br/>amis_ seemed to me a likely candidate.</p><p>In what follows, I&apos;d like first to focus on Mathieu&apos;s approach to<br/>Solage&apos;s piece, and on the more general issue of the relationship<br/>between great musical compositions and music theory. Then I&apos;ll present<br/>my own approach to this piece, which owes a great deal both to<br/>medieval theorists and to Willi Apel (a favorite of my college years).<br/>More recently, other scholars such as Richard Crocker and Sarah Fuller<br/>have published analyses of 14th-century polyphony to which I am also<br/>much indebted.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Mathieu and Hindemith: 5-limit views of 3-limit music<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>If we read Mathieu&apos;s discussion of this piece as a presentation on how<br/>Solage&apos;s adventurous music _can_ be tuned in a 5-limit lattice system<br/>and analyzed in 18th-century harmonic terms, then I have no problem<br/>with such a &quot;xenohistorical&quot; viewpoint. It may be somewhat like a<br/>presentation on how Beethoven or Chopin _can_ be tuned and analyzed in<br/>7-limit JI terms.</p><p>However, I would urge that such an approach is no substitute for a<br/>musical and intonational analysis premised on Solage&apos;s 14th-century<br/>setting or Beethoven&apos;s 19th-century setting. This means approaching<br/>Solage&apos;s music as a complex and sophisticated texture based on 3-limit<br/>sonorities and progressions, and likewise Beethoven&apos;s in terms of<br/>5-limit sonorities and progressions.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that Mathieu is by no means alone in analyzing<br/>14th-century music as if it were based on a tertian or 5-limit system<br/>(with thirds and sixths regarded as stable concords) rather than a<br/>trinic or 3-limit system.</p><p>In trinic music, the &quot;complete harmony&quot; or richest possible stable<br/>sonority is the trine, consisting of outer octave, lower fifth, and<br/>upper fourth. Sonorities involving thirds and sixths -- treated in<br/>theory and practice as &quot;imperfect concords&quot; which are relatively<br/>blending but inherently unstable -- often resolve by directed<br/>progressions to stable trines, and also frequently are treated in a<br/>more free or &quot;coloristic&quot; manner.</p><p>Not only Mathieu in approaching Solage, but Hindemith in an analysis<br/>of Solage&apos;s great predecessor Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300-1377)<br/>presented in the 20th-century classic _The Craft of Musical<br/>Composition_, treats 14th-century trinic music as if it were tertian.<br/>Specifically, this means describing complete stable trines in Machaut<br/>or Solage as if they were incomplete versions of 5-limit triads. Thus<br/>Hindemith, for example, concludes that Machaut&apos;s piece involves only<br/>small fluctuations in tension between what might be called &quot;triads in<br/>root position&quot; and &quot;triads in first inversion.&quot;</p><p>From a 14th-century perspective, however, such an approach neutralizes<br/>or disregards a critical contrast in this music: the contrast between<br/>stable trines and mildly unstable sonorities with thirds and/or sixths<br/>often inviting directed cadential resolutions to trines. This is<br/>rather like regarding complete triads in Beethoven or Chopin as<br/>incomplete seventh chords -- again neutralizing or disregarding the<br/>element of cadential tension and action.</p><p>While such &quot;xenohistorical&quot; analyses can be entertaining and<br/>intriguing, I would emphasize that they are not necessarily richer or<br/>more satisfying that more historically grounded approaches. In fact,<br/>theorists such as Johannes Boen writing in 1357, around the middle of<br/>Machaut&apos;s career, and Prosdocimus of Beldemandis and Ugolino of<br/>Orvieto in the early 15th century, provide many insights on<br/>verticality and accidentalism quite relevant to Solage&apos;s piece.</p><p>For example, Johannes Boen discusses the role of parallel thirds and<br/>sixths as the &quot;forerunners and handmaidens&quot; of stable concords such as<br/>fifths and octaves, as in the passage which follows (C4 is middle C,<br/>and higher numbers show higher octaves). While the F# inflection in<br/>the middle voice is not expressly indicated, it is called for by the<br/>14th-century norm that a third expanding by directed contrary motion<br/>to a fifth should be major:</p><p>D4 C4 B3    C4<br/>A3 G3 F[#]3 G3<br/>F3 E3 D3    C3</p><p>Here we have a series of unstable sonorities with an outer sixth, a<br/>lower third, and a fourth between the two upper voices, leading to<br/>a cadential resolution in which a lower major third expands to a fifth<br/>while an outer major sixth expands to an octave, arriving at the<br/>satisfying goal of a complete trine (M6-8 + M3-5).</p><p>From this viewpoint, Solage&apos;s _Fumeux fume_ and similar pieces around<br/>the end of the 14th century engage us both by sometimes fulfilling<br/>this usual cadential expectation as described by Boen, and sometimes<br/>by artfully delaying or diverting that expectation. In the late trinic<br/>or 3-limit music of Solage, as in the late triadic music of Chopin or<br/>Max Reger (the last comparison being Willi Apel&apos;s), expectations<br/>delayed or diverted may be as significant as those promptly fulfilled.</p><p>A Pythagorean or 3-limit JI tuning brings out both the _relatively_<br/>concordant quality of these thirds and sixths and what Mark Lindley<br/>aptly terms their &quot;lithesome tension.&quot; This tension underscores the<br/>expected cadential progressions which actually occur while lending a<br/>certain edginess to passages where one unstable sonority is followed<br/>by another in a chain of prolonged or diverted resolutions.</p><p>Indeed, this &quot;clouding&quot; of usual directed trinic progressions might<br/>add a level of musical meaning to the &quot;smoky&quot; text -- whether we take<br/>this text to refer to hemp smoking (a theory popular during the<br/>1960&apos;s) or to the &quot;whims and humors&quot; of the members of a poetic<br/>society (in English one might speak of &quot;vapours&quot; or possibly &quot;airs&quot;).</p><p>Of course, to say that the music Machaut or Solage fits and expands<br/>upon the framework of 14th-century theory does not mean that such<br/>great music can be _reduced_ to such a theory, any more than the music<br/>of Bach or Mozart can be reduced to the propositions of 18th-century<br/>counterpoint or harmony.</p><p>However, I would urge that 14th-century theory can provide a basic<br/>framework for an understanding of Machaut and Solage at least as rich<br/>as that provided by substituting the framework of some other era. As<br/>with many composers from various eras, of course, we are concerned not<br/>only with how late Gothic composers realize such a framework, but how<br/>they elaborate upon it and sometimes stretch it to suit their<br/>purposes.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>3. Solage: late 3-limit music and extended Pythagorean tuning<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>From a medievalist viewpoint, Solage&apos;s _Fumeux fume_ is a splendid<br/>example of extended Pythagorean intonation, with the qualification of<br/>course that voices and other non-fixed-pitched instruments will<br/>necessarily approximate rather than literally implement any fixed<br/>tuning scheme.</p><p>In Pythagorean intonation, all regular whole-tones are a pure 9:8, and<br/>diatonic semitones are 256:243, a compact 90 cents or so. Taking this<br/>approach, we negotiate _Fumeux fume_ from an individual performer&apos;s<br/>melodic viewpoint as a network of hexachords, each consisting of the<br/>pattern T T S T T (T = 9:8, S = 256:243). From a vertical point of<br/>view, we have a series of stable and unstable 3-limit sonorities, with<br/>directed resolutions from unstable sonorities to stable trines<br/>(complete or incomplete) serving as unifying cadential events.</p><p>The piece opens on a complete G trine (G2-D3-G3), and closes on an F<br/>trine (F2-C3-F3), so that we might say that the overall center or<br/>modal final is F. Interestingly, while G is the step above the final<br/>(the &quot;superfinal&quot; if we wish to use this term), the first section of<br/>the rondeaux concludes on Eb -- the trine a whole-tone _below_ the<br/>final (Eb2-Bb2-Eb3).</p><p>From a vertical point of view, the steps G-F and F-Eb are related by a<br/>kind of &quot;cadential chain&quot; of progressions involving M6-8 and/or M3-5<br/>or M10-12 resolutions. Thus, noting the strikingly low range (for this<br/>period) of Solage&apos;s piece, we find these directed progressions:</p><p>    B3 C4            D3 F3             D3 Eb3<br/>    E3 F3            B2 C3             A2 Bb2<br/>    G2 F2       or   G2 F2             F2 Eb2</p><p>(M10-12 + M6-8)     (M3-5)          (M6-8 + M3-5)</p><p>These are standard 14th-century cadences following the usual vertical<br/>logic, although Eb is a rather uncommon cadential goal (and one<br/>fitting the adventurous accidentalism of this piece). In contrast, the<br/>emphasis on the superfinal G is common in F-centered pieces of the<br/>14th century, although a more typical 14th-century scheme might have<br/>some internal cadences on A involving descending rather than ascending<br/>semitonal motion, e.g. in this low register</p><p>G3  A3<br/>D3  E3<br/>Bb2 A2</p><p>Returning to the structure of Solage&apos;s piece, with its sectional<br/>cadence on an Eb trine, we find also at the beginning of the rondeau&apos;s<br/>second section an artful passage moving from Eb through a prolonged<br/>and ornamented unstable sonority on G to the momentary goal of F:</p><p>1   2  | 1  2 | 1  &amp;  2  &amp; | 1 ...<br/>Bb3 C4   B3 B3  C4 B3    A3  C4<br/>Eb2      G2     D3 E3 F3 E3  F3<br/>Eb3      D3     G2           F2</p><p>Note the pleasant juxtaposition of Bb and B-natural, characteristic of<br/>the hexachord system generally as well as Solage&apos;s extension of it<br/>here to Gb-G#. Here the major tenth G2-B3 in the second measure<br/>suggests a progression to a stable sonority including an M10-12<br/>resolution -- and such a directed cadence does occur a measure later,<br/>with some ornamentation in both upper voices. In the course of the<br/>decoration, the middle voice touches on E3, the major sixth above G2,<br/>contributing an M6-8 resolution to reinforce this M10-12 resolution.</p><p>In addition to these cadential progressions which _do_ occur, we also<br/>encounter some invited or expected cadential resolutions which do not<br/>occur as we might anticipate. In the second section, for example, we<br/>have:</p><p>1   2  | 1  &amp;  2  &amp;    |</p><p>C#3      D3 C3    B[b]2<br/>F#3      G3       F3<br/>A2       Bb2   D2</p><p>Here the first sonority suggests a standard cadential resolution to a<br/>complete trine on G:</p><p>   F#3 G3<br/>   C#3 D3<br/>   A2  G2</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5)</p><p>While the upper two voices move as might be expected, the lower voice<br/>moves not to G2 but to Bb2, forming another unstable sonority with an<br/>outer major sixth.</p><p>Such &quot;diverted&quot; progressions give the texture a certain restless<br/>quality which might be also be described as &quot;floating&quot; or &quot;smoky&quot; --<br/>somewhat analogous to the floating seventh sonorities of Romantic<br/>triadicism in the 19th century.</p><p>While an extended Pythagorean framework for this piece may bring out<br/>both the directed cadences when they do occur, and the &quot;restlessness&quot;<br/>of the many diversions and digressions, this is not to say that<br/>performers cannot shade certain intervals in one direction or<br/>another. For example, some major thirds and sixths might lean now and<br/>then toward Pythagorean diminished fourths (~5:4) or sevenths (~5:3).</p><p>A Pythagorean keyboard instrument with 15 or more notes per octave<br/>would not only permit an apt performance of this piece in a<br/>fixed-pitch framework, but would also offer the choice of using some<br/>of these variant thirds and sixths in sonorities involving written<br/>sharps. As one moves into the early 15th century, and approaches the<br/>epoch of Guillaume le Grant (another practitioner of daring<br/>accidentalism) and the young Dufay, such a contrast between regular<br/>and &quot;smoothed&quot; Pythagorean thirds and sixths might be especially<br/>likely.</p><p>This has by no means been a full analysis of _Fumeux fume_, only a<br/>sketch of one medievalist approach to the piece.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
