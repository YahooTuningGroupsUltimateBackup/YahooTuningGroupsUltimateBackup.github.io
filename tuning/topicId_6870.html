For but one refutation of this point of view, see Blackwood&apos;s _Structure<br/>of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings_.</p><p>&gt;Most of the writings I have looked at<br/>&gt;from those times (not comprehensive, but some original writings)<br/>&gt;assume just intonation as being the &quot;true&quot; basis for the pitch<br/>&gt;structure of music,</p><p>Just intonation is the true basis for the consonant intervals. That is all.</p><p>&gt;with temperament - mean tone and later equal<br/>&gt; temperament - being a necessary but not ideal slight modification<br/>&gt;of the &quot;true harmonies&quot; needed so that the music could be performed<br/>&gt; on instruments having a limited number of fixed pitches.</p><p>That is not the case. A simple diatonic, triadic piece in one key may sound<br/>wrong in strict just intonation, because often shifts or drifts of a comma will<br/>occur. We&apos;ve gone over this myriad times before, but I&apos;d be happy to do so again.<br/>Also, as Margo has been describing in great detail, there were reasons why the<br/>various temperaments were used when they were -- they are not simply alternative<br/>simplifications of just intonation; rather, they are realizations of musical<br/>ideals that varied with the times.</p><p>&gt;When I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;looked at 18th &amp; 19th century books on music - and even some 20th<br/>&gt;century ones, the just ratios of musical intervals are laid out in great<br/>&gt;detail as being the foundation of musical pitch and harmony.</p><p>Yes, the just ratios are the foundation of harmonic _consonance_. But there is<br/>more to music than that -- primarily _melody_.</p><p>&gt;Some which I remember are Rameau&apos;s Treatise on Harmony; Owen&apos;s<br/>&gt;Dictionary of the Sciences from the late 1700s quoted in Jorgenson&apos;s<br/>&gt;work on tuning in which the author speaks of mean tone tuning as introducing<br/>&gt;small errors into the true musical intervals which are perceptible, but<br/>&gt;still do not harm the music&apos;s effect;</p><p>Absolutely. But meantone tuning was necessary to allow the _melodic_ structure of<br/>the music to fit with these acceptable _harmonic_ approximations.</p><p>&gt;William Pole&apos;s Philosophy of Music<br/>&gt;(1879); the first edition of Schoenberg&apos;s Harmonielehre of 1911;</p><p>Unfortunately, not a paragon of accuracy (historical or mathematical) in<br/>discussion of tuning.</p><p>&gt;Also, some of these earlier writings imply that much vocal music<br/>&gt;was performed in closer to just intonation than equal temperament and<br/>&gt;had a different character as a result - a delightful character according<br/>&gt;to some of the authors.  No mention was made of singers singing in<br/>&gt;mean tone temperament in things I&apos;ve read.</p><p>Singers may sing in _adaptive_ JI, where each simultaneity is tuned in JI (nearly<br/>enough) but the intervals between successive pitches are irrational. In this way<br/>they may &quot;hide&quot; the commas of strict JI. Ultimately this approach has elements in<br/>common with meantone. However, recent evidence seems to show that the _melody_ in<br/>vocal music tends to be the strongest determinant of intonation -- the melody is<br/>usually performed in something close to 12-equal or Pythagorean, and the other<br/>singers form JI harmonies behind that.</p><p>&gt;Recently, some early cylinder recordings of vocal music recorded<br/>&gt;in the late 1800s have been reissued on CD.  Many of the early<br/>&gt;recorded quartet songs sound as though the singers were striving for<br/>&gt;just intonation.</p><p>Strict JI or adaptive JI?</p><p>&gt;I have not made an exhaustive study of the historical literature,<br/>&gt;but most of what I&apos;ve seen has pointed in the direction of just intonation&apos;s<br/>&gt;having been assumed without argument as being the natural basis for<br/>&gt;musical harmony - especially after the discovery of overtones was<br/>&gt;made in the 17th century by Galileo and Mersenne.</p><p>The relevance of just intonation for musical _harmony_ is undeniable, although<br/>the psychoacoustic factors at play are quite complex and not at all explicable<br/>merely on the basis of the existence of overtones. But musical tuning is a result<br/>of oftenconflicting influences from harmony (vertical relationships) and _melody_<br/>(horizontal relationships). The combination of these two factors, applied to the<br/>musical language of a given time period, as well as considerations of<br/>convenience (which you note), determined the tuning appropriate to that period&apos;s<br/>music.</p><p>In the last century, the field of ethnomusicology has shattered many of our naive<br/>presuppositions about musical tuning. Although functional harmony seems to have<br/>been a peculiarly Western development, melody is virtually universal to all<br/>cultures. The scales of a great number of these cultures have been studied (look<br/>up almost any country in the _New Grove_), and very few can be said to represent<br/>or even resemble the &quot;classical&quot; Western ideal of just intonation as put forward<br/>by some of the authors you mention. In the post-Newtonian West, systematization<br/>and numerification became very popular in all fields, which sought to reproduce<br/>the successes of Newtonian theory in physics. Most of the products of this<br/>misguided inspiration have been soundly overturned in the 20th century.</p></div>
