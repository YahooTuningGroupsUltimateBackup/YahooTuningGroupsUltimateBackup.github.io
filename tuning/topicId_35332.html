That&apos;s pretty self-evident.  Now, possibly<br/>string players sometimes play in Pythagorean, as has been asserted on<br/>this list, and possibly singers play in just sometimes, as has also<br/>been claimed.  But, for the most part, they are doing it<br/>*unsystematically* by &quot;accident&quot; (or &quot;musicianship&quot; ??) so to speak.</p><p>Their basic *aim* is obviously 12-tET.  They are not *used* for the<br/>most part, to doing systematic microtonality.  This is why I include<br/>an &quot;ear training&quot; CD with my recent pieces, so that players can get<br/>used to playing *at least* the three deviations from 12-tET in 72-tET<br/>of 50 cents, 33 cents and 17 cents.</p><p>Even *that* much is a stretch for many of these people.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard has told me that *he* would never, personally, use<br/>such a CD for training.  Well, why *would* he!?  Of *all* people<br/>around, he&apos;s spent a *lifetime* of playing alternate tunings, before<br/>many of the &quot;lummmanaries&quot; on this list were even *born* most<br/>probably, so he certainly has no *need* of &quot;training wheels.&quot;</p><p>But that&apos;s because Johnny has *already* been trained!  Surely he can<br/>play a 33 cent, 17 cent and 50 cent deviation from 12-tET accurately!</p><p>However, Johnny is the *ultimo* example of a specialized<br/>microtonalist, and, I believe, to think the *majority* of fine<br/>players could/would/can play *systematic* microtonality -- and by<br/>that I mean microtonality that&apos;s *written out* to be *specific*<br/>deviations from 12-tET or whatever, is a big stretch.</p><p>I fear anybody who thinks these guys, even very fine musicians, can<br/>do this accurately would be sorely disappointed...</p><p>jp</p></div><h3><a id=35393 href="#35393">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>3/8/2002 7:20:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 3/8/02 9:26:39 PM Eastern Standard Time, <a href="mailto:jpehrson@rcn.com">jpehrson@rcn.com</a><br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; However, Johnny is the *ultimo* example of a specialized<br/>&gt; microtonalist, and, I believe, to think the *majority* of fine<br/>&gt; players could/would/can play *systematic* microtonality -- and by<br/>&gt; that I mean microtonality that&apos;s *written out* to be *specific*<br/>&gt; deviations from 12-tET or whatever, is a big stretch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I fear anybody who thinks these guys, even very fine musicians, can<br/>&gt; do this accurately would be sorely disappointed...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jp<br/>&gt;</p><p>Giuseppe, I&apos;m sorely disappointed on this List plenty of times, as in life.<br/>But you have written off &quot;very fine musicians&quot; unfairly.   The evidence is<br/>before your very ears, every time the AFMM does a large piece like the Ives<br/>&quot;Unanswered Question&quot; in Pythagorean tuning.  While I didn&apos;t conduct, I<br/>played with the orchestra and trained the players in this and other tunings<br/>for the audience.  If even ONE of the string players was off, THEN you and<br/>everyone else would take notices.  If the 6 violins were not in perfect<br/>unison, you would know it.  I had given out cents deviations to each player<br/>and there were the proverbial 3 rehearsals.  Man, everything was beautifully<br/>in tune, time and time again, with me working with &quot;very fine musicians.&quot;  It<br/>always helps to have an Eggar, Solberg, Bolotowsky, Catler, etc. around to<br/>help the &quot;very fine musicians&quot; in their transitions to the microtonal<br/>aesthetics desired.  But it always works.</p><p>JP: I guess the question is whether players *should* be trying<br/>to &quot;adjust&quot; 72-tET *toward* Just as an *intention* or whether they<br/>should be trying for *accurate* 6th tones and 12th tones.</p><p>JR: Excellent point.  It is best for the composer to compose some prose for<br/>explaining the desired harmonies.</p><p>JP:  Or is the distinction again the *3 Penny Opera* perhaps too little to<br/>really worry about??</p><p>JR: This is the most troublesome thing to me in the recent postings, that<br/>music lovers that cannot negotiate 3 cents or less convincingly to themselves<br/>believe this is not possible of anybody else.</p><p>As I have been trying to get certain concepts across, albeit with difficulty,<br/>this may be more to taste.  Imagine that before anyone could hear a single<br/>cent interval, one would have to hold a single pitch signal without waver.<br/>This means no vibrato, no dips, no increase or decrease, just straight tone.<br/>As a bassoonist I have done this since conservatory.  It comes with a<br/>particular kind of trained breathing that allows for a steady pressure of air<br/>that is pressed behind the tongue.  The tongue lets the air through the reed<br/>in even, steady flow.  Playing into a Korg Tuner shows an unmoving needle.</p><p>This is a hurdle most people on this list may have difficulty imagining for<br/>themselves.   But I can assure y&apos;all it doesn&apos;t happen ONLY on a bassoon, or<br/>only a bassoon in my hands.  There is some serious myopia on this list<br/>regarding microtonal orchestration.</p><p>Since working with Harry Partch&apos;s music I have honed my voice for maximum<br/>value in his music.  I can now hold a single vocal sound that does not move<br/>with GREAT care and a receptive environment.  What I want to share is the<br/>answer to Patrick&apos;s question about being able to hear better than a cent.</p><p>The reason I believe I can hold a single pitch vocally is because I have<br/>demonstrated this to people all over the world, and everyone hears what I am<br/>hearing.  People can tell if there is a calm, still, thin vocal tone.  Now<br/>what I do next is vocalize a Perfect Fifth from the overtone series, grabbing<br/>it first from the harmonics of human voice (as in hoomi chanting).  I etch an<br/>ascending interval in the air to mutual satisfaction, and then sing the equal<br/>tempered fifth down to the very same fundamental as the first fifth.</p><p>This is a melodic technique, which is helpful in the Li Po songs.  Sometimes<br/>I have a  simultaneity with the viola, but there is a note that proceeds it<br/>which I have no way to find.  I can learn the interval to the simultaneity<br/>and in effect, find that first unrelated note.  What I can then do is isolate<br/>the 2 highest pitches, which just less than 2 cents away from each other.  To<br/>total mutual satisfaction, I have been able to lay a single pitch frequency<br/>in between the 2 cent interval, leaving 3 increments of just under a cent<br/>each (though &quot;basically&quot; a cent each).  A mathematician on the list will be<br/>able to give the frequency differences hear (except for the bisecting tone),<br/>but I prefer to think it through cents.</p><p>When I was in Winnipeg performing Partch with Critical Band, we did a radio<br/>show in a restaurant.  John Gzowski asked me to do this demonstration on the<br/>radio.  Mutual satisfaction.  (though he did say right afterwards to get<br/>those oscilloscopes and begin the analysis, or some such).  The Catlers heard<br/>it, Wendy Carlos (who hears as well as I do).  When I do the 3 cent scale,<br/>people don&apos;t seem to be able to tell direction and hear basically movement.<br/>Most importantly, this is self-taught.  I think MANY of y&apos;all could learn<br/>ways to improve your ears.  This is the best away to understand most fully<br/>the materials ya&apos;ll are working with.  If the composer hears it, then its<br/>easy to demonstrate.  If the composer cannot hear it, their cover is blown in<br/>the minds of the musicians.  If you pay them well they&apos;ll give you their<br/>best.  But if you tell them exactly what to play you have the best chance of<br/>getting the optimum in the music.  If you make to many new symbols they are<br/>likely to get confused and frustrated.  Maybe this is a most important<br/>microtonal technique.  Good luck to you all in your explorations.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=35398 href="#35398">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/8/2002 9:14:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_35332.html#35393">/tuning/topicId_35332.html#35393</a></p><p>***Thanks so much, Johnny, for your valuable and PRACTICAL update<br/>about performance!</p><p>This was even *more* than &quot;a penny for your thoughts&quot; and I<br/>appreciate it!</p><p>jp</p></div>
