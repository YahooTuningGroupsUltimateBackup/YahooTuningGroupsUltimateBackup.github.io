I&apos;ve<br/>heard her live a half-dozen times, and she always tuned her piano herself<br/>before the concert.  I suppose whether or not her recordings are in meantone<br/>will depend entirely on whether her label&apos;s studio is located somewhere where<br/>the pianos must be tuned by a guild member.</p></div><h3>DWolf77309@xx.xxx</h3><span>9/13/1999 2:18:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In einer Nachricht vom 9/13/99 3:22:10 PM (MEZ) - Mitteleurop.<br/>Sommerzeischreibt <a href="mailto:A440A@aol.com">A440A@aol.com</a>:</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/> Greetings,<br/>     Ayeee!!  Is this the Piano Technician&apos;s Guild we are referring to?  If<br/> so,  I would like to say that the &quot;Guildness&quot; of a technician is not a<br/>factor<br/> in what is tuned.  I would certainly hope that the choice of temperament<br/> would be the resulting harmonic balance of the music.<br/> Regards,<br/> Ed Foote  &gt;&gt;</p><p>The fact is that there are places on the planet where players are not allowed<br/>touch the insides of a keyboard instrument before a performance or recording<br/>because that responsibility is restricted to professional technicians.

It has nothing to do with the Piano Technicians&apos;<br/>Guild, it has to do with contracts between halls and specific tuners. At<br/>this point most professional tuners that I know own, and often use,<br/>Sanderson Accu-Tuners and could produce a non-equal tuning on request;<br/>some of us even understand the principles behind it. In perforamnce as in<br/>life much depends on diplomacy.</p><p>Judy</p></div><h3>A440A@xxx.xxx</h3><span>9/13/1999 3:12:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; The fact is that there are places on the planet where players are not<br/>&gt;allowed touch the insides of a keyboard instrument before a performance or<br/>recording  because that responsibility is restricted to professional<br/>technicians.<br/>&gt;If the  technician under contract to a given studio can not or will not tune<br/>&gt;anything other than 12tet, then tough luck, even if the performer can do it<br/>herself.</p><p>Greetings,<br/>   Ah, ok.  This is not dependant on the Guild.<br/>    In the above situations, the artist must request a different tuning.<br/>Sooner or later, as more and more artists do this, venues will begin to cater<br/>to the broadened temperament tastes.  It just takes time.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div>
