I&apos;ve<br/>heard her live a half-dozen times, and she always tuned her piano herself<br/>before the concert.  I suppose whether or not her recordings are in meantone<br/>will depend entirely on whether her label&apos;s studio is located somewhere where<br/>the pianos must be tuned by a guild member.</p></div><h3><a id=4800 href="#4800">ðŸ”—</a>DWolf77309@xx.xxx</h3><span>9/13/1999 2:18:30 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In einer Nachricht vom 9/13/99 3:22:10 PM (MEZ) - Mitteleurop.<br/>Sommerzeischreibt <a href="mailto:A440A@aol.com">A440A@aol.com</a>:</p><p>&lt;&lt;<br/> Greetings,<br/>     Ayeee!!  Is this the Piano Technician&apos;s Guild we are referring to?  If<br/> so,  I would like to say that the &quot;Guildness&quot; of a technician is not a<br/>factor<br/> in what is tuned.  I would certainly hope that the choice of temperament<br/> would be the resulting harmonic balance of the music.<br/> Regards,<br/> Ed Foote  &gt;&gt;</p><p>The fact is that there are places on the planet where players are not allowed<br/>touch the insides of a keyboard instrument before a performance or recording<br/>because that responsibility is restricted to professional technicians. If the<br/>technician under contract to a given studio can not or will not tune anything<br/>other than 12tet, then tough luck, even if the performer can do it herself.</p></div><h3><a id=4801 href="#4801">ðŸ”—</a>Judith Conrad &#x3C;jconrad@xxxxxxx.xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>9/13/1999 2:34:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, 13 Sep 1999 <a href="mailto:DWolf77309@cs.com">DWolf77309@cs.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; The fact is that there are places on the planet where players are not allowed<br/>&gt; touch the insides of a keyboard instrument before a performance or recording<br/>&gt; because that responsibility is restricted to professional technicians.

It has nothing to do with the Piano Technicians&apos;<br/>Guild, it has to do with contracts between halls and specific tuners. At<br/>this point most professional tuners that I know own, and often use,<br/>Sanderson Accu-Tuners and could produce a non-equal tuning on request;<br/>some of us even understand the principles behind it.

This is not dependant on the Guild.<br/>    In the above situations, the artist must request a different tuning.<br/>Sooner or later, as more and more artists do this, venues will begin to cater<br/>to the broadened temperament tastes.  It just takes time.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote</p></div>
