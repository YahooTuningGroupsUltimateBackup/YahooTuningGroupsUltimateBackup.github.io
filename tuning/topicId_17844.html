For me, that&apos;s frustrating, cause I think things started<br/>getting really interesting with the advent of Parker and crew...not to<br/>mention Miles Davis, John McLaughlin, Coltrane, Mingus, Ornette,<br/>etc...it&apos;s a good show, maybe they&apos;ll do one from 1950 onwards next<br/>time...Hstick PS...the ugliness and ubiquity of racism is hard to ignore<br/>in this series...I am astonished at how bad things were for folks of<br/>color...and, I have a scary feeling that it isn&apos;t really much better<br/>today. There&apos;s surely more laws to protect folks of color, but I doubt<br/>if attitudes have changed much in many parts of the country...witness<br/>our next attorney general praising the confederacy and what it stands<br/>for...yow</p></div>
