IIRC, DAT is 48K 16-bit samples per second, CD is 44.1K 16-bit<br/>&gt;samples per second and DVD is 96K 24-bit samples per second. Hard drives are<br/>&gt;whatever your hardware and software are capable of doing. So what are these<br/>&gt;parameters for a &quot;minidisk&quot;??</p><p>If printed specs are to be believed, then the Sharp MD-MS702 I use records at 44.1k with 24-bit samples. The 24 bit figure is listed in conjunction with their ATRAC encoding, which is unique (I believe) to the MD format.</p><p>But M., those are just the numbers. My point is that the MD sounds more than *good enough* for my purposes! A DAT will always record and sound better than an MD, but in a portable situation, the DAT is far more expensive, the media costs more, and the battery (therefore recording) life is much less. Not to mention the beauty of the small form factor. For &apos;quick-and-dirty&apos; documentation of events it is my tool of choice. If a concert needs a *real* recording, then one of the other formats is the default.</p><p>But while I read all the numbers before I shopped and bought, it came down to my personal litmus test, as it always does: listening with my ears.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div>
