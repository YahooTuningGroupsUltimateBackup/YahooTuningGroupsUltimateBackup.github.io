His music sounds varied and fantastic (even in a pure harmonic or melodic<br/>sense not counting arrangements)...as does that of Carlos Serafani, Marcus<br/>Satellite, Knowsur, Sevish, Igs, and countless others who are NOT proclaimed<br/>masters at psychoacoustics (at least by your standards).   I&apos;m sure you&apos;d take<br/>the musical challenge Cameron presented if you thought you had any chance of<br/>winning...to me not taking it is basically your admitting defeat (how many<br/>others on this list agree?)</p><p>  But please, feel free to prove me wrong by taking the challenge (Carl vs.<br/>Cameron)...it would be particularly interesting if you two were forced to do a<br/>song with only one instrument, exactly the same instrument sample or<br/>virtual-instrument-and-settings with no effects or mastering, the same tempo,<br/>only 8th notes used (with no 8th notes skipped), and no drums IE the entire<br/>focus would be on the chords and tuning chosen (nothing to do with differences<br/>in phrasing, arrangement, or anything else).  Let&apos;s do this!<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>  I could dig into any of their works and find numerous examples of things like<br/>chords that work well without pointing to a steady virtual fundamental, scales<br/>that do not scale well to lower-limit triads or tetrads (especially those that<br/>rely on the dyadic periodicity you have claimed is very sketchy for 3+ note<br/>chords), and much much more.  And sometime they do things that are good examples<br/>of psychoacoustics in action...and that it can be relevant to music.</p><p>   I don&apos;t agree musicians generally have bad skills at psychoacoustics (though<br/>their ability to explain what they hear and how they do what they do may vary).<br/>However I will say those who bow down to psychoacoustics without questioning<br/>exceptions to it composition are very likely to sound MUCH more shallow as<br/>musicians.</p><p>Jonsz&gt;&quot;I think of a lonely bugle, sounding the notes of a pure major triad,<br/>playing &quot;Taps&quot;, in many people&apos;s minds one of the saddest refrains of all.&quot;<br/>   Here&apos;s an example of music not conforming to &quot;what should be&quot; so far as<br/>psychoacoustics.  Meanwhile a major chord on a guitar or piano sounds of<br/>happiness to many people.  Again goes back to my point that psychoacoustics<br/>works much, but not all the time, and is connected to music just not perfectly<br/>so.</p></div><h3>Kalle Aho &#x3C;kalleaho@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2010 9:36:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs,</p><p>as you must know these things are heavily debated in aesthetics and<br/>philosophy of music.

It appears on higher level than individual isolated notes, intervals or chords - that is from their interaction in time. Because music is time dependent art. When listening the music, we don&apos;t hear individual notes (intervals, chords, note lengths...) but their context. (Same with language - individual characters or phonems have no meaning, and we don&apos;t read individual characters or hear individual phonems, but words and sentences - this has some meaning, words itself, and words combined into sentences, and there&apos;s even hidden meaning very often there, expressed by intonation, expression, dynamics, tempo and color of the voice, and let&apos;s not forget about abstract metaphors in poems far from the real meaning of words and sentences). Shapes of melody, upper and lower peaks, opening and closing formulae... this bears some meaning. Chords and their progressions in Western music are usually connected with melody, support its shapes, accompany it and depending on chord complexity and balance of consonances and dissonances, and also depending on rhythmic structure, timbre, instrumentation, dynamics, expression, articulation, tempo changes...  we feel tension or relax... All this is also connected with form of the work - motifs, themes, periods, question/answer... And there are also some typical patterns for each music style, epoch, every composer has some typical and stable constants which we can learn to recognize and enjoy... On the first hearing usually we can also hear  motivic and thematic work, changes of the shape of melody, variations, modulations, changing major - minor, return of motifs, their tonal relations, procesual changes or sudden contrasts, gradation, climax, anticlimax, tempo changes, density of textures etc. Thanks to our memory we can keep motifs and other elements there and compare with the other which will come later during listening the work. This comparison which we learn by listening lot of music, and by repeated listening to the same works, is our listener&apos;s experience, in fact cultural self education.  Thanks to this composer can build the composition, its form, and when we have some listening experience (even without deeper knowledge of music theory) we start to understand what composer and his/her work want to tell us. All this interaction starts to have some higher sense, logic, connection, meaning, associations, relations to the other works of the same composer, the other composers, the other musical styles, epochs...  And of course intelectual understanding is one thing, but music has also emotional impact. But in my opinion it&apos;s so much connected to that constructive domain of music, that to enjoy music fully on the emotional level, we must have certain level of listening experience. And this is not universal, even not in our contemporary global village where anybody can listen any music from all over the world. We have to learn some style by active and repeated listening to it, and after some experience we can start to understand its dialect and enjoy it. If we are not ready to enjoy some style, we can&apos;t enjoy it - it sounds just boring to us.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing universal about human expression and emotions. Try to live few years in Japan (like me :-) and you will understand what I mean. Generally.</p><p>And concerning the music, Japanese have been exposed to Western music since about 1870, but until now only few of them can really understand it and enjoy.</p><p>I doubt some Borneo aborigin will be able to enjoy Mozart piano sonata or Bartok music fully... Or that we westerners would fully understand (and therefore also emotionally enjoy) some Indian raga, all those nuances hidden there... But of course we can learn to understand and enjoy it by some study and lot of listening experience.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 28 Sep 2010, at 12:20 AM, cityoftheasleep wrote:</p><p>&gt; Look: I know that in music (or at least in culture), context is &gt; capable of over-riding things like pyschoacoustic response.

For an example, see here:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_factor_theory_of_emotion">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_factor_theory_of_emotion</a></p><p>The cliffs are:<br/>1) The epinephrine (adrenaline) shot increased the intensity of<br/>emotion felt by the participants (either playfulness or anger), unless<br/>2) They were aware in advance that what they were being injected with<br/>was adrenaline and what effects it would have - they attributed their<br/>feelings to an effect from the epinephrine and not to any particular<br/>emotion.</p><p>So this led to the &quot;two-factor theory&quot; of emotion. The idea is that<br/>the two factors are &quot;arousal&quot; (sympathetic nervous system activation)<br/>and &quot;cognition&quot; (how one interprets this activation, which is<br/>dependent on a million things). There are apparently newer models of<br/>emotion, but most that I can find still involve some notion of<br/>arousal. And if we&apos;re dealing with chords that sound progressively<br/>more dissonant and unpleasant, and that make us want to turn them off,<br/>then the idea that we&apos;re dealing with sympathetic activation is far<br/>from implausible - actually I think there are studies showing that<br/>physiological arousal occurs when dissonant sounds are played.</p><p>Hence we are dealing with arousal (which is one of the building blocks<br/>of emotion).</p><p>The second factor is cognition, e.g. how you&apos;d label that activation,<br/>or what cultural factors go into the emotion, end up affecting the<br/>emotion produced. Even the knowledge that &quot;this is a listening test<br/>that will make you feel like xxx&quot; will all change the end result, as<br/>the knowledge that one was being injected with epinephrine changed the<br/>end result.</p><p>Whether newer models of emotion usurp this is beyond the point - the<br/>point is this is not, in general, a task that is beyond research, nor<br/>does it conflict with anyone&apos;s creative individuality.</p><p>The second point, that a chord can sound different in two musical<br/>contexts is also irrelevant, because if you view the chord and its<br/>surrounding context as a unit, then that &quot;unit&quot; tends to lead to more<br/>predictable results. Hence if I say &quot;a minor chord sounds sort of<br/>&apos;sad&apos; in chord progression A,&quot; and &quot;a minor chord sounds sort of<br/>&apos;happy&apos; in chord progression B,&quot; and most people agree, then that just<br/>means that chord progressions A and B are what lead to predictable<br/>outcomes and can hence be analyzed. Or perhaps chord progression A<br/>sounds different in two larger musical contexts as well, which can<br/>then be predicted. That being said, I simply want to start studying<br/>individual chords, as a building block which can eventually lead<br/>somewhere else.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2010 11:00:46 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>As I scan the medical literature as well as some sources on music<br/>cognition, I see that my hypothesis about arousal and dissonance as a<br/>mechanism causing it actually comes up a lot.

Music that sounds happy to a person from one culture may sound sad to another. I think there&apos;s sense in regarding music as formalised speech.  All spoken words are actually sung, it&apos;s just that we don&apos;t notice the melodies most of the time. Recording a spoken phrase and playing it over and over again makes a person conscious of the melody that was always there. But there never were &quot;first peoples&quot;. Humans evolved from the common ancesters we share with chimps and bonobos. It was a gradual process. You couldn&apos;t point to one generation and say &quot;these are human but their parents were not&quot; even if you could travel back in time. Many animals, including birds and probably some dinosaurs, had music before there were people. I am interested in comparing the music of other species with human music. I jam with my dog. I play mouth organ or slide whistle and he sings.</p><p>Also, Igs, you are wrong. People are not the only animals who can be happy or sad.

Just as great poetry comes from &quot;bending&quot; the rules of proper language, great music comes from bending the rules of proper music theory.  Neither Mike nor I are inexperienced musicians with thick-headed ideas that chords can only ever have one meaning that cannot change.  But when you try to understand how a language works--even if it&apos;s your own language--you start with the formal/&quot;proper&quot; uses of the most basic components of it.  Just because a single word has less meaning than a sentence, or receives a good portion of its meaning from context, does not mean it has no inherent meaning.</p><p>I think you have to agree that there is *some* meaning in a single &amp; bare chord.  Maybe not much, not enough to register as a full emotion with all its complexity...but there is still *something*.  As microtonalists, I know we are *all* concerned with the subtle emotional differences between intervals and the contributions these subtleties can make to music.  To understand *how* intervals are different from each other, do we not first have to understand their individual characteristic/powers?  Or at least the limits of their metaphorical potentials?  I mean, there just HAS TO be *some* level of meaning, however vague, to individual chords, and that is what Mike is trying to investigate.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Meaning in music (including emotional) of course comes &quot;from<br/>&gt; intervals and harmonies&quot;. It appears on higher level than individual<br/>&gt; isolated notes, intervals or chords - that is from their interaction<br/>&gt; in time. Because music is time dependent art. When listening the<br/>&gt; music, we don&apos;t hear individual notes (intervals, chords, note<br/>&gt; lengths...) but their context. (Same with language - individual<br/>&gt; characters or phonems have no meaning, and we don&apos;t read individual<br/>&gt; characters or hear individual phonems, but words and sentences - this<br/>&gt; has some meaning, words itself, and words combined into sentences,<br/>&gt; and there&apos;s even hidden meaning very often there, expressed by<br/>&gt; intonation, expression, dynamics, tempo and color of the voice, and<br/>&gt; let&apos;s not forget about abstract metaphors in poems far from the real<br/>&gt; meaning of words and sentences). Shapes of melody, upper and lower<br/>&gt; peaks, opening and closing formulae... this bears some meaning.<br/>&gt; Chords and their progressions in Western music are usually connected<br/>&gt; with melody, support its shapes, accompany it and depending on chord<br/>&gt; complexity and balance of consonances and dissonances, and also<br/>&gt; depending on rhythmic structure, timbre, instrumentation, dynamics,<br/>&gt; expression, articulation, tempo changes...  we feel tension or<br/>&gt; relax... All this is also connected with form of the work - motifs,<br/>&gt; themes, periods, question/answer... And there are also some typical<br/>&gt; patterns for each music style, epoch, every composer has some typical<br/>&gt; and stable constants which we can learn to recognize and enjoy... On<br/>&gt; the first hearing usually we can also hear  motivic and thematic<br/>&gt; work, changes of the shape of melody, variations, modulations,<br/>&gt; changing major - minor, return of motifs, their tonal relations,<br/>&gt; procesual changes or sudden contrasts, gradation, climax, anticlimax,<br/>&gt; tempo changes, density of textures etc. Thanks to our memory we can<br/>&gt; keep motifs and other elements there and compare with the other which<br/>&gt; will come later during listening the work. This comparison which we<br/>&gt; learn by listening lot of music, and by repeated listening to the<br/>&gt; same works, is our listener&apos;s experience, in fact cultural self<br/>&gt; education.  Thanks to this composer can build the composition, its<br/>&gt; form, and when we have some listening experience (even without deeper<br/>&gt; knowledge of music theory) we start to understand what composer and<br/>&gt; his/her work want to tell us. All this interaction starts to have<br/>&gt; some higher sense, logic, connection, meaning, associations,<br/>&gt; relations to the other works of the same composer, the other<br/>&gt; composers, the other musical styles, epochs...  And of course<br/>&gt; intelectual understanding is one thing, but music has also emotional<br/>&gt; impact. But in my opinion it&apos;s so much connected to that constructive<br/>&gt; domain of music, that to enjoy music fully on the emotional level, we<br/>&gt; must have certain level of listening experience. And this is not<br/>&gt; universal, even not in our contemporary global village where anybody<br/>&gt; can listen any music from all over the world. We have to learn some<br/>&gt; style by active and repeated listening to it, and after some<br/>&gt; experience we can start to understand its dialect and enjoy it. If we<br/>&gt; are not ready to enjoy some style, we can&apos;t enjoy it - it sounds just<br/>&gt; boring to us.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s nothing universal about human expression and emotions. Try to<br/>&gt; live few years in Japan (like me :-) and you will understand what I<br/>&gt; mean. Generally.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And concerning the music, Japanese have been exposed to Western music<br/>&gt; since about 1870, but until now only few of them can really<br/>&gt; understand it and enjoy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I doubt some Borneo aborigin will be able to enjoy Mozart piano<br/>&gt; sonata or Bartok music fully... Or that we westerners would fully<br/>&gt; understand (and therefore also emotionally enjoy) some Indian raga,<br/>&gt; all those nuances hidden there... But of course we can learn to<br/>&gt; understand and enjoy it by some study and lot of listening experience.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 28 Sep 2010, at 12:20 AM, cityoftheasleep wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Look: I know that in music (or at least in culture), context is<br/>&gt; &gt; capable of over-riding things like pyschoacoustic response.

That that could be the case seems illogical and nonsensical to me, but I&apos;ve never been one to insist that humanity and/or the universe obey my idea of logic or sensibility.  All I&apos;m saying is that you can&apos;t make a meaningful sentence out of gibberish, and that I think there has to be *some kind of* meaning to a chord that explains its ability to 1) give context to other chords and 2) receive context from other chords.  As I&apos;ve said: if it turns out that that meaning is more vague than conventional wisdom suggests, then so it is.  But it&apos;s still worthy of study, just to figure out that little bit of meaning that may lurk in a single chord, from which larger meaning can be constructed.

It&apos;s a &quot;restful&quot; song, not a sad one, and I can think of few triads that have a stronger claim to &quot;restfulness&quot; than a pure major triad.  Strip the song of it of its cultural context, and all vestige of sadness is stripped away as well.  Is it really so totally nuts to you that someone might want to investigate the potential meaning a chord can convey when stripped of its larger musical/cultural context?</p><p>Seriously, Jon, I&apos;m not a simpleton.  I&apos;m not--and I never have been--arguing that all chords are stuck with fixed, narrow, absolute meanings, or that whatever meaning a chord might have will, of necessity, override a listener&apos;s own emotional state (though that may be possible in exceptional cases).  I&apos;m well aware that conditioning and association can override and in some cases create initial reactions to certain stimuli.  Also, in my whole life, I&apos;ve heard only one &quot;musical&quot; sound that can actually over-power my emotions, and that&apos;s the sound of a large gong played softly--a totally atonal sound, which never the less forced a relaxation upon me that I was powerless to resist.  Certainly, though, I&apos;ve heard plenty of non-musical sounds that induced other involuntary emotional responses--the sound of a human weeping, of a dog whining, a cat purring, the ocean crashing, a police siren, a fire alarm, a gunshot, etc.  Humans are auditory creatures, and I think it&apos;s inarguable that the majority of us are tuned in to respond predictably to certain stimuli--why should we not expect to at least find suggestions or traces of these response patterns in relation to music?</p><p>So I ask you again, can you demonstrate a simple chord progression or melody that can make a minor chord sound happier than a major chord with the same root?

Neither of us has anything other than anecdotal evidence right now, and while I am doing nothing more than proposing an investigation based on an hypothesis arrived at by logic, YOU are insisting that any such investigation is doomed from the get-go, based on YOUR experiences.</p><p>But for the sake of argument, I will concede that one chord on its own may have too vague of a meaning to be successfully studied.  I should concede this anyway, because I recently posted audio examples of chords wherein a 6/5 above the root sounded &quot;major&quot;, and another example wherein chords with a 5/4 above the root sounded &quot;minor&quot;--these examples demonstrated (at least to my satisfaction) that chord-quality is relative.  But what about two chords that share all but one common tone?  I&apos;ve yet to see any evidence from *anybody* that there&apos;s no discernible emotional difference between a triad of 1-5/4-3/2 and a triad of 1-6/5-3/2.  I&apos;m not convinced that the one with the 6/5 is necessarily going to be sadder for everyone (at least, not any more).</p><p>But I DO suspect that for a given person, whatever emotion they associate with the 1-5/4-3/2 chord IN RELATION TO a 1-6/5-3/2 chord of the same root, no amount of *musical* (i.e. non-behavioral) context is capable of switching that emotional relationship for that person, as long as both chords are relatively present for comparison.</p><p>So: if we can&apos;t say that &quot;chord x&quot; has &quot;emotional effect y&quot; on it is own, is it at least plausible that we can say &quot;chord x&quot; will have &quot;emotional effect y&quot; if heard in relation to &quot;chord z&quot;?</p><p>And I really DO want to know (consider this to be the &quot;start&quot; of my data-gathering): have you ever heard a chord progression that can make a major chord sound sadder than a minor chord of the same root?  I.e. a progression that has both a C major and a C minor in it, yet the C major sounds sadder than the C minor?  I don&apos;t care if you expect me to agree or not, I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF IT DID IT FOR YOU.  I&apos;ve never seen it done for ANYONE before, so if you have any examples, they would make EXCELLENT data for me to analyze.</p><p>And of course, the &quot;you&quot; that I use in this message is really intended to mean &quot;everyone else on the list&quot;, because I know Jon Szanto has preemptively declined further response.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2010 1:22:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs,</p><p>&gt;-- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t understand why you&apos;d declare your intention not to respond further, but then continue the dialog by asking several non-rhetorical questions.

The left<br/>hemisphere does not speak, but is actively involved in music, poetry<br/>and other forms of communication. This relationship does not hold<br/>true for other language types. Japanese language, researchers<br/>believe, is linked with the right hemisphere. Perhaps because it is<br/>more tonal, poetic, less digital than European language. Bilingual<br/>Japanese process English and Japanese in opposite hemispheres.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp">http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp</a>?<br/>_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED187085&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchTy<br/>pe_0=no&amp;accno=ED187085<br/>(quotation)<br/>&quot;Research conducted by Tadanobu Tsunoda on auditory and visual<br/>sensation, designed to test and understand the functions of the<br/>cerebral hemispheres, is discussed. Tsunoda discovered that the<br/>Japanese responses to sounds by the left and the right sides of the<br/>brain are very different from the responses obtained from people from<br/>other countries. His tests show that a Japanese left cerebral<br/>hemisphere receives a wide range of sounds: linguistics sounds (vowel<br/>and consonant sounds); and nonlinguistic sounds, including cries,<br/>emotional utterances, traditional Japanese musical instruments,<br/>sounds of wind, waves, and creeks. In comparison, the range of sounds<br/>received by the left hemisphere of people from western countries is<br/>narrower, apparently limited to syllables made up of consonant and<br/>vowel sounds. On the other hand, the right hemisphere of a Japanese<br/>receives a very limited amount of artificial or man-made sounds:<br/>mechanical sounds, Western musical instruments, and noise. Japanese<br/>living outside of Japan where Western languages are spoken do not<br/>show the typical Japanese pattern after the second or third<br/>generation. However, the children of Americans or Koreans who are<br/>exposed from their birth to a complete Japanese environment have the<br/>Japanese brain functioning system. It appears that the uniqueness of<br/>the Japanese brain functions comes from the influences of the<br/>environment.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.brainy-child.com/article/braindevcenter.shtml">http://www.brainy-child.com/article/braindevcenter.shtml</a></p><p><a href="http://www.cuug.ab.ca/dorfsmay/delirium/brain_hemis.html">http://www.cuug.ab.ca/dorfsmay/delirium/brain_hemis.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www.successwaves.com/pages/activating-rt-brain.htm">http://www.successwaves.com/pages/activating-rt-brain.htm</a></p><p><a href="http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=6238&action=new">http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=6238&action=new</a></p><p><a href="http://www.tojet.net/articles/111.pdf">http://www.tojet.net/articles/111.pdf</a></p><p><a href="http://www.eupsychia.com/perspectives/articles/musicbrain.html">http://www.eupsychia.com/perspectives/articles/musicbrain.html</a></p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 1 Oct 2010, at 4:51 AM, genewardsmith wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That&apos;s what I meant.
