If I&apos;m not mistaken, John Starrett&apos;s FAQ entry uses a<br/>directory that has a space... so we&apos;re getting Guitar%20Refretting<br/>and so forth, and I believe you said you CAN&apos;T use that, correct??</p><p>John will have to change that directory and put an underscore in it,<br/>correct??  I have no access to his directory, so I can&apos;t do it<br/>myself... so until John does that we can&apos;t make a URL link...</p><p>Unfortunately, I&apos;m not following AT ALL your system of ascii<br/>references using &quot;$&quot;.  It seems inconsistent, but it may be that I&apos;m<br/>just not &quot;getting&quot; it.  Is there another way of explaining it a bit<br/>more &quot;gently...&quot;?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>______ _____ ____ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
