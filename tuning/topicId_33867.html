I&apos;m interested in input to the &apos;performance&apos; notation<br/>discussions, but not the &apos;analysis&apos; discussions - I have many years<br/>of experience in the first, many minutes of experience in the second.</p><p>Thank you for your attention to this matter,<br/>webmaster &apos;at&apos; notationisnotasimpleword &apos;dot&apos; com</p></div>
