I was rather horrified to find tiny inaccuracies in about three dozen intervals involving the numbers 23, 25, and 29 as factors. What must have happened, since the mistakes ran consistently, was that my value for 1200/log2 got corrupted on my calculator as I was figuring out those ratios. However, the discrepancies only ranged from 0.021 cents to 0.042 cents, all too high, and none of them affected the order of intervals. In addition there were a few rounding errors affecting only thousandths of a cent, and one one-cent typo: 222.463 cents for 256/225 rather than the correct 223.463. I hope no one has been inconvenienced. Everything how now been corrected and triple-checked. Please alert me if you find any other mistakes (and I&apos;ll hang myself).</p><p>In addition, I came to realize that some people still use the old address at my old Earthlink site. The better address is now <a href="http://www.kylegann.com/Octave.html">http://www.kylegann.com/Octave.html</a>, where I moved to and expanded so I could include mp3s.</p><p>To err is human, to correct divine.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle</p></div><h3><a id=50918 href="#50918">ðŸ”—</a>Kyle Gann &#x3C;kgann@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2004 11:18:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Let me try that Anatomy of an Octave address again, without the comma that makes it not work:</p><p><a href="http://www.kylegann.com/Octave.html">http://www.kylegann.com/Octave.html</a></p><p>KG</p></div><h3><a id=50935 href="#50935">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>1/3/2004 1:56:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Kyle,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kyle Gann &lt;kgann@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Let me try that Anatomy of an Octave address again,<br/>&gt; without the comma that makes it not work:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.kylegann.com/Octave.html">http://www.kylegann.com/Octave.html</a></p><p>i see that you cited Danieliou&apos;s book.  want to add<br/>a link to my &quot;big list of 11-limit intervals&quot; page?</p><p><a href="http://tonalsoft.com/enc/interval-list.htm">http://tonalsoft.com/enc/interval-list.htm</a></p><p>by my calculation, there are 1200 intervals within<br/>the 8ve on my page ... i didn&apos;t plan it that way,<br/>i swear it.</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3><a id=50972 href="#50972">ðŸ”—</a>czhang23@aol.com</h3><span>1/3/2004 9:50:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 2004:01:03 07:11:20 PM, <a href="mailto:kgann@earthlink.net">kgann@earthlink.net</a> writes:</p><p>&gt;[...] I hope no one has been inconvenienced.<br/>&gt;Everything how now been corrected and triple-checked.
