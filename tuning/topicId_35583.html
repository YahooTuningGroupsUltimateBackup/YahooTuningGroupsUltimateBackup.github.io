It may be more than that, but<br/>it is at least that. While my request for the new format was intended simply<br/>to be able to sing the high third and then compare it to your various<br/>thirds, it has provided for some interesting insights.</p><p>First, some general observations. The beating rates in jerries 1-7 (old<br/>format arranged in close voicing) are all approximately 6 to 7 per second.<br/>The beating rates in jerries 01-07 (new format in open voicing) are all<br/>about 3+ per second. I suppose this to be caused by their respective 4/5/6<br/>and 2/3/5 positions (approximately) in the partials series. My conclusion<br/>here is that the items in each set were pretty much equally &sup3;out of tune&sup2; as<br/>far as dissonance is concerned. Therefore, seeking the &sup3;best&sup2; tuning in<br/>terms of beating would be (and indeed was) quite fruitless.</p><p>My earlier reported &sup3;epiphany&sup2; upon singing the high third into jerry00 and<br/>finding agreement was exhilarating, as you would imagine. My initial thought<br/>(as you know) was that you had discovered the tuning of the &sup3;high third.&sup2; I<br/>later noted, however, that when the root and fifth drop out in jerry00, the<br/>sustaining third takes a dive of about fifty to sixty cents (considering my<br/>novice experience with such measurements). That observation convinced me<br/>that jerry00 (and likely jerry0) is JI.</p><p>Then I simply listened to jerry00 without singing. The impression of high<br/>third was thereÂ‹loud and clear. Again, when the root and third dropped out,<br/>the perceivable pitch of the third was clearly lower than when sounding in<br/>the major chord. This seems to demonstrate why Joseph, upon hearing jerry0,<br/>reported hearing a third that was considerably higher than JI. (I wish more<br/>had offered their impressions. Thanks, Joe. I noticed that Gene has<br/>inquired. Any others????)</p><p>My son was getting ready to walk out the door the other day but I delayed<br/>him long enough to get his opinion as to the &sup3;best&sup2; tuning of the eight new<br/>jerries. Erik is not a professional musician but he plays a mean guitar (by<br/>ear) and he listens to a lot of music. He selected jerry04 and jerry07. He<br/>wasn&sup1;t sure which of these two he liked better. (Jerries 04 and 07 were my<br/>own choices, as I reported here earlier.)</p><p>Over the weekend, my brother was here. Jon is neither a musician nor a<br/>choral singer, but he has great ears. Without explaining the purpose, I<br/>asked him to listen to the new jerries and to tell me which tuning he<br/>preferred. He was quite sure he favored jerry04. I suggested he listen again<br/>to jerry00 and compare; he stayed with jerry04. Then I asked him to sing<br/>&sup3;his&sup2; third into the empty fifth in both examples; the third he sang was<br/>exactly the third I would have sung. He said he heard similar agreement in<br/>both jerry00 and jerry04 but still preferred jerry04.</p><p>So, why didn&sup1;t Erik and Jon prefer the JI jerry00, with its near-perfect<br/>beatless consonance? Were they &sup3;brainwashed&sup2; by having heard high thirds all<br/>of their lives? Why were they (and I, for that matter) agreed that jerry04<br/>was the &sup3;best&sup2; tuning among the new jerries?</p><p>I had observed earlier that I could sing either the JI third or the high<br/>third into jerry00 with considerable agreement. When singing the JI third<br/>the agreement would, of course, extend through the end of the example, even<br/>after the root and fifth dropped out. However, when I sang the high third,<br/>the &sup3;consonance&sup2; sounded only while the root and fifth were sounding; after<br/>that point, the dissonance between my third and the JI third was clearly<br/>audible.</p><p>I wondered whether Jon preferred jerry04 over jerry00 because he sensed a<br/>dissonance between his third and the JI third. The dissonance had been quite<br/>evident to me after the root and third dropped out but not so much before<br/>that. Perhaps he sensed it during the sounding of the three-note chord.<br/>There would, of course, be less potential for that particular dissonance in<br/>jerry04 since there was only one third present.</p><p>To dig further into these and other questions, I converted Paul&sup1;s .wav files<br/>to .aif and loaded them into Audio Logic in order to play them<br/>simultaneously. I played jerry00 simultaneously with each of the other new<br/>jerries, and, as I suspected, the best sounding combination was with<br/>jerry04, with jerry07 a close second.</p><p>Then, to further explore my impressions, I slid the examples backward and<br/>forward in temporal relation to each other in order to hear changes as<br/>various thirds entered and left the mix. Again, jerry04 created the least<br/>variation in &sup3;expected&sup2; pitch when played with jerry00. However, at the end<br/>of the staggered playings, the last sounding pitch seemed either very high<br/>or very low, depending on which of the two jerries was last. The difference<br/>in the two thirds was enormous, in my opinion.</p><p>These observations helped settle one important question in my mind. The<br/>&sup3;high third&sup2; is not a product of culturally induced preference. Rather it is<br/>a specific harmonic perceptual experience produced by the well-tuned<br/>combination of root, fifth and major third. It likely doesn&sup1;t occur when the<br/>elements are not well tuned, as in 12t-ET piano chords. Perhaps that is why<br/>singers, string players and certain wind players are more likely to be<br/>influenced by it.</p><p>On the other hand, these observations raise a number of other interesting<br/>questions. Are all high-third experiences a result of hearing well-tuned JI<br/>major triads? Or do musicians actually produce real high thirds as a result<br/>of having experienced the psycho-acoustically produced JI &sup3;high&sup2; third. Or<br/>are all &sup3;high&sup2; thirds actually well-tuned JI and we simply *think* they are<br/>higher than JI?</p><p>My impression is that I was singing a real high third in relation to jerry00<br/>because my voice was dissonant to the JI third after the root and fifth<br/>dropped out. Also, remember that Jon preferred the &sup3;naked&sup2; high third in<br/>jerry04 rather than the one he sang along with the JI third in jerry00.<br/>These observations would seem to suggest that nature &sup3;taught&sup2; us the high<br/>third, we got used to hearing it, and learned to produce it at will.</p><p>SoÂŠÂŠwhaddya think???</p><p>Paul, are you ready to unveil your numbers?

The problem was<br/>that it changed to some extent from day to day and from pass to pass. Even<br/>the way I held my head in relation to the speakers changed the perception to<br/>some extent. One of the problems in perception was the difference in<br/>&quot;timbre&quot; caused by the beating of the &quot;real&quot; high thirds. In that sense, the<br/>&quot;warmth&quot; of the real ones contrasts with the &quot;starkness&quot; of the JI one,<br/>which tends to interfere with the perceptual isolation of pitch alone.</p><p>On the other hand, there was considerable consistency on which of the<br/>jerries 01-07 were &quot;closer&quot; to jerry00. The &quot;winnners&quot; are still 04 and 07,<br/>but 01 and 05 are pretty close, too. In fact all of the jerries in this<br/>batch could probably &quot;pass&quot; as a practical high third. I&apos;m quite sure I&apos;ve<br/>heard them all at one time or another. As far as a &quot;for sure&quot; ranking is<br/>concerned, they&apos;re all too close to call with any assurance that tomorrow&apos;s<br/>perception will be the same as today&apos;s.</p><p>Concerning the matter of approximate cents value, I&apos;m convinced that the<br/>difference in pitch between all the real thirds here is less than one cent.<br/>I&apos;m told that the difference between an acoustic perfect fifth and a 12t-ET<br/>fifth is only two or three cents. I know very well what that difference<br/>sounds like. I don&apos;t hear anything close to that difference between these<br/>&quot;real&quot; thirds.</p><p>To test that hypothesis, I isolated the single-tone regions  of jerries<br/>01-07 (&quot;real&quot; thirds) and played them together and one after the other. When<br/>played together, they sound like a fairly good unison. When played one after<br/>the other, they sound like the &quot;same pitch.&quot; However, when I played the odd<br/>numbered ones together and then the even numbered ones together, there was a<br/>clear difference in pitch; which shows that there are in fact different<br/>pitches here.</p><p>Following that exercise, I played each isolated third immediately following<br/>the JI triad, letting the triad sound long enough to establish the &quot;high<br/>third&quot; effect. Now, without the beating of the real high-third triad, I was<br/>able to hear a comparison of each real third to the JI produced third.</p><p>Again, most of them sounded a bit higher than the JI third, some more than<br/>others (but not consistently). 07 sounded very close. So, I played 07 in<br/>combination with each of the others. The best combination was 07 and 05. Too<br/>my surprise, the combination of 04 and 07 (everyone&apos;s favorites when heard<br/>in a triad) sounded &quot;reluctantly,&quot; beginning with only the high overtones<br/>and gradually filling out the full body of the tone. Strange!</p><p>So, I think this is the best I can do. My conclusions, as I stated earlier,<br/>is that we probably learn the high third from experiencing the<br/>psycho-acoustic &quot;high&quot; third in well-tuned (JI) triads, and then likely<br/>produce *actual* high thirds because they &quot;sound good.&quot;</p><p>Incidentally, I didn&apos;t learn that the JI third was actually lower than the<br/>keyboard&apos;s third until I had been a college teacher for fifteen years. My<br/>ears always heard it as higher. Now I know why.</p><p>Okay. That&apos;s it, Paul. Your take on all of this, please.

So, when an actual high third is sung into a perfectly<br/>&gt;&gt; tuned fifth (2:3) it doesn&apos;t produce a &quot;higher&quot; third.

Too bad! I think this<br/>&gt;&gt; exercise has resulted in *very* significant evidence, and explains very<br/>&gt;&gt; clearly (at least to me) why the &quot;high third&quot; is so commonly  popular with<br/>&gt;&gt; singers, string players and other musicians who have opportunity to hear JI<br/>&gt;&gt; major triads (as opposed to keyboard ones).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I might have expected disinterest from a bunch of piano players, but I&apos;m<br/>&gt;&gt; disappointed that more of the experienced ears in this group didn&apos;t weigh<br/>&gt;&gt; in. (Johnny????) On the other hand, perhaps their first round with the<br/>&gt;&gt; jerries were as confusing to them as they were to me, and they didn&apos;t have<br/>&gt;&gt; the time to &quot;play&quot; with the raw material as I did.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; On the other hand, I&apos;m wondering how many of this august society have<br/>&gt;&gt; knowingly experienced the &quot;high third&quot; phenomenon. It&apos;s not hard to do. My<br/>&gt;&gt; beginner singers in my &quot;baby choir&quot; at the college have experienced it<br/>&gt;&gt; (without being prompted, by the way). Yet, my micro-tuning colleague at<br/>&gt;&gt; school believes the &quot;high third&quot; simply sounds sharp. What about you? Listen<br/>&gt;&gt; to jerry00. Does the third &quot;take a dive&quot; when the root and third drop out?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; no, i don&apos;t hear that. but i remember hearing things like that when i<br/>&gt; was first experimenting with microtonality. it&apos;s a psychological<br/>&gt; (call it psychoacoustical) phenomenon known as *categorical<br/>&gt; perception*. if you&apos;ve been brought up as a musician in an equal-<br/>&gt; tempered musical environment, a few youngsters acquire perfect pitch,<br/>&gt; but the rest of us still the intervals we hear into mutually<br/>&gt; exclusive categories. there have been startling psychological<br/>&gt; demonstrations of this and the tricks it can play on musicians&apos; ears.<br/>&gt; the effects disappear in those with no musical interest, those from<br/>&gt; very different cultures, and those who have subjected their ears to<br/>&gt; alternative tunings for long periods.</p><p>Yep. We&apos;re all different to some degree, depending on our &quot;input.&quot;<br/>Interesting to me that you &quot;remember&quot; hearing the high third but now have<br/>&quot;trained&quot; your ear to ignore it. Perhaps this is the wrong crowd to test<br/>what appears to be a &quot;malady&quot; of singers and string players. :-)</p><p>BTW, I have the time now (since I recently retired from my college gig) to<br/>do some reading.

I looked in the archive and found nothing<br/>with those keywords, can you provide me with a message number.<br/>&gt; i made this argument a few months ago here -- search the archives<br/>&gt; for &apos;classical uncertainty principle&apos;.</p><p>Now some other comments and detail on my analysis of the &quot;jerries&quot;</p><p>About the &quot;noise&quot;<br/>-----------------</p><p>What I named &quot;noise&quot; in the jerries is not white (evenly distributed in<br/>frequency) broadband background noise. When I look at the spectrum of the<br/>jerries, I noted that the resonance where not as sharp as could be expected<br/>for some acoustical sources.</p><p>For example, when I look at the spectrum of a (finely recorded) harpsichord,<br/>The peaks stay extremely narrow (less than 1Hz which is the precision of my<br/>measurement) until it disappear in the background noise that may be -60 dB<br/>below ( for the stronger partials).</p><p>For the jerries, the peaks broaden around the maximum and is about 15 Hz<br/>wide at -40 dB. That gives a significant amount of non-harmonic energy<br/>between the partials that I named (perhaps abusively) noise. I do not know<br/>if this &quot;noise&quot; is perceptively significant and if so how it is perceived. I<br/>can make the hypothesis that this so called &quot;noise&quot; may give the rugosity<br/>(to not say &quot;harshness&quot; that may be pejorative) that may give the illusion<br/>that the third is not just.<br/>This is just an out-of-the-blue hypothesis.</p><p>About just thirds<br/>-----------------<br/>A made some measurement on some renaissance and early baroque a cappella<br/>music recording. I analyzed the &quot;justness&quot; of final major triads and<br/>discovered that, most of the time, they are as 4:5:6 just as can be<br/>measured: the potentially beating partial overlaps completely. I do pretend<br/>to have a 1 cent precision, but the a cappella thirds by trained singers are<br/>seemingly much more like JI than 12ET.</p><p>So I was then even more surprised that professional musicians can be fooled<br/>by jerry0. That is the reason why I am trying to formulate some hypothesis.</p><p>About antiresonnance<br/>---------------------<br/>Seemingly the jerries where produced by the digital equivalent of a bench of<br/>resonators in parallel. In the frequency domain, there are some frequencies<br/>where two resonators have similar amplitudes: If they are in phase, they<br/>smoothly recover each other and the so called &quot;noise&quot; keeps a smooth<br/>spectrum. If they are in phase opposition, that produce a deep valley in the<br/>spectrum, an antiresonnance. Most of the time, a &quot;hole&quot; in the already low<br/>background noise is not significant. But if this valley is near a peak (a<br/>partial), it &quot;cuts the edge of the mountain&quot; and may move the maximum by (at<br/>most) a few Hz. Is that of any perceptual effect for the jerries?</p><p>About &quot;nasality&quot;<br/>----------------<br/>A few years ago, I worked on the perception of nasality in order to improve<br/>the French speaking speech synthesizer. The conclusions where... not<br/>conclusive:<br/>- perception of nasality is associated to antiresonances in the overall<br/>spectrum of speech<br/>- perception of nasality is also associated with the dynamic of the sound<br/>- I could propose empiric rules for synthesis, but no general rules for what<br/>causes &quot;nasality&quot; perception.<br/>Nevertheless, I remember attending a rehearsal of a symphonic orchestra and<br/>the chef asked the cellos to sound &quot;less nasal&quot; and obtained immediately the<br/>change of tone expected!!! Nasality seems to be a general tone quality that<br/>can be applied to non-speech sound.</p><p>In conclusion to the conclusion<br/>--------------------------------<br/>To verify if the &quot;noise&quot; and the antiresonances have any effect at all on<br/>the perception of tone, it would be interesting to remake the jerries (at<br/>least jerry0) with pure harmonic synthesis (addition of sine).</p><p>yours truly,</p><p>Fran&iuml;&iquest;&half;ois Laferri&iuml;&iquest;&half;re</p></div><h3><a id=35672 href="#35672">ðŸ”—</a>alternativetuning &#x3C;alternativetuning@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2002 1:38:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; While this is true, I personally would like to know whether, in<br/>jerry00, you<br/>&gt; &gt; hear the third differently after the root and fifth drop out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is *that* what this is all about?

The results for complex tones are explained by the octave<br/>intervals that were found with simple tones and the pitch differences<br/>between simple and complex tones.</p><p>These conclusions were revisited here:</p><p>Terhardt, E., Grubert, A. (1987). Factors affecting pitch judgments<br/>as a function of spectral composition. Percept. Psychophys. 42, 511-<br/>514</p><p>Stimulated by a recent paper by Platt &amp; Racine [Perception &amp;<br/>Psychophysics 38, 543-553 (1985)], we discuss the factors that<br/>probably are involved in certain inconsistencies observed in pitch<br/>judgments of tones with different spectral composition. Typically,<br/>discrepancies reported in the literature are of the order of 10 cents<br/>in magnitude. We point out that measurement of such small pitch<br/>effects is heavily dependent on systematic individual differences;<br/>and, when individual differences are averaged out (as is essentially<br/>the case in Platt &amp; Racine&apos;s experiments), verification of the actual<br/>auditory stimulus SPL within a few dB is necessary. Utilizing the<br/>virtual-pitch theory, we evaluate the effects of frequency, SPL, and<br/>earphone frequency response. Further, we present experimental and<br/>theoretical data on pitch of piano tones relevant to the problem. The<br/>study elucidates that, taking into account the factors mentioned,<br/>agreement between the various data considered, as well as theoretical<br/>understanding, actually is much better than may have become apparent<br/>on first sight.</p><p>In Terhardt, E.

Am. 24, 147-152</p><p>When a pure tone is mixed with a noise of uniform spectrum, its<br/>threshold is sraised. At levels above threshold, its loudness and<br/>pitch are changed by the presence of the noise. Introducing abrupt<br/>changes in the slope of the noise spectrum by filtering out<br/>(rejecting) one octave changes these effects in the vicinity of this<br/>gap. The masked threshold for a pure tone varies from the value for<br/>unfiltered noise at the edges of the gap to a value approximately 25<br/>dB lower at the middle. This indicates that gappedi-noise may be used<br/>to mask out sounds outside of the gap without unduly raising the<br/>threshold of sounds in the gap. Presence of white noise generally<br/>raises the pitch of a pure tone whose frequency is between 500 and<br/>4000 cps. Presence of noise with the gap does not raise the pitch of<br/>a pure tone located in the upper half of the gap. For a tone located<br/>in the lower half of the gap, the pitch is raised more than it would<br/>be in the presence of unfiltered noise. The changes in the judged<br/>loudnessof pure tones partially masked by a gapped-noise reaffirm the<br/>importance of the tails of the excitation pattern in their effect on<br/>loudness.</p><p>Webster, J.C., Schubert, E.D.

Having only a smattering of audio experience, I&apos;ll read your posts<br/>like a hungry sponge. Hopefully, my questions will not be too na&iuml;ve.</p><p>Jerry</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; About the &quot;noise&quot;<br/>&gt; -----------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I named &quot;noise&quot; in the jerries is not white (evenly distributed in<br/>&gt; frequency) broadband background noise. When I look at the spectrum of the<br/>&gt; jerries, I noted that the resonance where not as sharp as could be expected<br/>&gt; for some acoustical sources.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, when I look at the spectrum of a (finely recorded) harpsichord,<br/>&gt; The peaks stay extremely narrow (less than 1Hz which is the precision of my<br/>&gt; measurement) until it disappear in the background noise that may be -60 dB<br/>&gt; below ( for the stronger partials).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the jerries, the peaks broaden around the maximum and is about 15 Hz<br/>&gt; wide at -40 dB. That gives a significant amount of non-harmonic energy<br/>&gt; between the partials that I named (perhaps abusively) noise. I do not know<br/>&gt; if this &quot;noise&quot; is perceptively significant and if so how it is perceived. I<br/>&gt; can make the hypothesis that this so called &quot;noise&quot; may give the rugosity<br/>&gt; (to not say &quot;harshness&quot; that may be pejorative) that may give the illusion<br/>&gt; that the third is not just.<br/>&gt; This is just an out-of-the-blue hypothesis.</p><p>When you say &quot;the jerries,&quot; do you mean all of them. Only jerry00 is JI. The<br/>others would naturally contain some dissonance since their thirds are not in<br/>small-number agreement with the other elements. Is there a difference in<br/>&quot;rugosity&quot; (nice word) between jerry00 and the others?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; About just thirds<br/>&gt; -----------------<br/>&gt; A made some measurement on some renaissance and early baroque a cappella<br/>&gt; music recording. I analyzed the &quot;justness&quot; of final major triads and<br/>&gt; discovered that, most of the time, they are as 4:5:6 just as can be<br/>&gt; measured: the potentially beating partial overlaps completely. I do pretend<br/>&gt; to have a 1 cent precision, but the a cappella thirds by trained singers are<br/>&gt; seemingly much more like JI than 12ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So I was then even more surprised that professional musicians can be fooled<br/>&gt; by jerry0. That is the reason why I am trying to formulate some hypothesis.<br/>&gt;<br/>I&apos;m not sure I like your word &quot;fooled.&quot; But then...who knows? That may be<br/>what we ultimately conclude. (Something tells me that Paul would accept such<br/>a bottom line as that with more grace than I would.)</p><p>&gt; About antiresonnance<br/>&gt; ---------------------<br/>&gt; Seemingly the jerries where produced by the digital equivalent of a bench of<br/>&gt; resonators in parallel. In the frequency domain, there are some frequencies<br/>&gt; where two resonators have similar amplitudes: If they are in phase, they<br/>&gt; smoothly recover each other and the so called &quot;noise&quot; keeps a smooth<br/>&gt; spectrum. If they are in phase opposition, that produce a deep valley in the<br/>&gt; spectrum, an antiresonnance. Most of the time, a &quot;hole&quot; in the already low<br/>&gt; background noise is not significant. But if this valley is near a peak (a<br/>&gt; partial), it &quot;cuts the edge of the mountain&quot; and may move the maximum by (at<br/>&gt; most) a few Hz. Is that of any perceptual effect for the jerries?</p><p>Paul?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; About &quot;nasality&quot;<br/>&gt; ----------------<br/>&gt; A few years ago, I worked on the perception of nasality in order to improve<br/>&gt; the French speaking speech synthesizer. The conclusions where... not<br/>&gt; conclusive:<br/>&gt; - perception of nasality is associated to antiresonances in the overall<br/>&gt; spectrum of speech<br/>&gt; - perception of nasality is also associated with the dynamic of the sound<br/>&gt; - I could propose empiric rules for synthesis, but no general rules for what<br/>&gt; causes &quot;nasality&quot; perception.<br/>&gt; Nevertheless, I remember attending a rehearsal of a symphonic orchestra and<br/>&gt; the chef asked the cellos to sound &quot;less nasal&quot; and obtained immediately the<br/>&gt; change of tone expected!!! Nasality seems to be a general tone quality that<br/>&gt; can be applied to non-speech sound.</p><p>In singing, &quot;nasal resonance&quot; is a good thing, and gives warmth and<br/>flexibility to vocal tone. What is often called a &quot;nasal tone,&quot; however, is<br/>a closing off of the nasal passages (like speaking while holding your nose).<br/>I have no idea what a cellist would do to effect such a change.</p><p>Incidentally, directors of musical ensembles often request changes in style<br/>by using such words as &quot;nasal,&quot; &quot;bright,&quot; &quot;spooky,&quot; &quot;mournful,&quot; etc., and<br/>players and singers simply read their minds and do something different from<br/>what they were doing--generally with good results. In most cases, the<br/>performers (and conductor) might have some difficulty in saying exactly what<br/>they did to effect the change.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In conclusion to the conclusion<br/>&gt; --------------------------------<br/>&gt; To verify if the &quot;noise&quot; and the antiresonances have any effect at all on<br/>&gt; the perception of tone, it would be interesting to remake the jerries (at<br/>&gt; least jerry0) with pure harmonic synthesis (addition of sine).</p><p>Is that an offer? If so, I suggest you use the format of jerry00--from the<br/>second series of jerries in which the third comes in later than the root and<br/>fifth and sustains after the root and fifth drop out.</p><p>Thanks again for your help on this, Fran&ccedil;ois.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=35690 href="#35690">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/2002 2:22:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 3/15/02 5:32 AM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Subject: Re: Jerries: a conclusion or two<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@j...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; While this is true, I personally would like to know whether, in jerry00, you<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; hear the third differently after the root and fifth drop out.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Is *that* what this is all about?

From my<br/>early experiment on a cappella singing experiment, I would like to add a few<br/>comment about the precision of measure versus length of chords. You wrote in<br/>mess. 29265</p><p>&gt; Much has been made of the 3- and 4- cent deviations from JI in 72-tET<br/>&gt; chords. At a typical musical frequency of 440Hz, 4 cents is a 1Hz<br/>&gt; deviation. So the classical uncertainty principle would seem to say<br/>&gt; that, for frequency to be determined to better than this accuracy,<br/>&gt; the note would have to be played for 2*pi, or over 6 seconds! Clearly<br/>&gt; most music has melodies and even chord changes that are much faster<br/>&gt; than this. Thus any attempt to say whether the chords were in JI or<br/>&gt; in 72-tET would be meaningless.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rebuttals?</p><p>That is in fact a bit too rigid. It is possible to cheat by taking benefit<br/>of the harmonicity of most acoustical instrument (including human voice). If<br/>instead of taking spectral measure on the fundamental frequency, using the<br/>Nth harmonics, it is possible to increase relative accuracy by N: for<br/>instance 1Hz at 440Hz (F0) is 4cents, but it become 2cents at 880Hz (F1),<br/>1.3 cents at 1320Hz (F2), 1.0 cent at 1760 (F3) and so on.</p><p>Theoretically, it is possible to reach an astonishing 0.12cents accuracy at<br/>15000Hz (average perception threshold for adults)!! In practice, when I used<br/>this trick on human voice, I realized that only a few harmonics are sharp<br/>enough to provide accurate measurement. In best cases, after F2 or F3,<br/>widening of harmonics overweight the potential gain in relative precision.<br/>Further, for even the simplest chords, it is difficult to resolve who&apos;s who<br/>in the beating harmonics.</p><p>On the other hand side, if, again, I looked at harpsichord notes, and can<br/>see that all the harmonics keep the same sharpness up to at least F30; so<br/>even 1Hz accuracy is probably sufficient to measure and compute the tuning<br/>from an occurrence of a single chromatic scale.</p><p>I ought to realize that human voices are produced by soft tissues, and so,<br/>cannot be as precise as a string stretched over a rigid wooden box.</p><p>Further (and now it is more a matter of opinion than measurement), I think<br/>that the perception of whether or not two notes are &quot;in tune&quot; depends mostly<br/>of their first beating harmonics, i.e. F1/F0 for octave, F2/F1 for fifth,<br/>F3/F2 for the fourth, F4/F3 for the major third and so on. higher beating<br/>harmonics produces beat of lesser amplitude at an integer multiple of the<br/>first beat, so make a quite subtle modulation to the perceived beat. Thus I<br/>think that for the figures above (440+-1Hz) we are (optimistically) limited<br/>to a precision worse than a cent.</p><p> About just thirds<br/>-----------------<br/>I wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; A made some measurement on some renaissance and early baroque a<br/>cappella<br/>&gt; &gt; music recording.

My apologies for not hanging around here lately, but<br/>I&apos;ve been terribly busy with music and life in general. Paul E. had<br/>once mentioned to me in an offline email something about this fellow<br/>with the jazz choir that likes high thirds. I will call them &quot;supra-<br/>ET&quot; thirds.</p><p>I agree that the best renaissance a cappella choirs sing just thirds.<br/>The ones that don&apos;t are simply demonstrating relative incompetence<br/>vis-a-vis those that do. Renaissance a cappella music is very triadic<br/>in its harmonic strucuture; meantone temperaments with pure or quasi-<br/>pure thirds were the order of the day; so it is natural to sing that<br/>music with just thirds.</p><p>My reaction to the &quot;supra-ET&quot; thirds in the jazz chorus and the<br/>renaissance choirs&apos; contrast with that is simple:</p><p>Jazz harmonies contain harmonic extensions such as 7ths, 9ths, and<br/>13ths (sixths if in close-voiced &quot;6th-9th chords&quot;). Many such chords,<br/>especially the &quot;6th-9th&quot; chords just mentioned, can be voiced open<br/>in &quot;stacked fourths&quot; and variations of them such as stacked fourths<br/>with a third on top or an augmented fourth on the bottom (which is<br/>the 7th with resepect to the root, the latter of which is generally<br/>on top in this kind of voicing (e.g. Bb, E, A, D, G, C, which in<br/>close-voicing with the root at the bottom is C, E, G, Bb, D with an A<br/>thrown in somewhere, but this voicing is not conducive to the<br/>presence of the A as &quot;sixth&quot; or &quot;thirteenth&quot;).</p><p>Now we all know that fifths (and fourths, by implication) and thirds<br/>are not mutually compatible in terms of just tuning. They must be<br/>traded off with each other. In the renaissance, the tradeoff<br/>sacrificed the fifths and fourths for the thirds and sixths.</p><p>In stacked fourth voicings and any other voicings in jazz harmony<br/>with equivalent or similar harmonic extensions, a series of fourths<br/>or fifths that are 5+ cents flat sound terribly flacid, wimpy and<br/>unconvincing, with none of the sought-for jazzy &quot;bite&quot; and sonority.<br/>This means the thirds in this context want to get sacrificed for the<br/>fourths and fifths, so ET works well here.</p><p>However, I think the spread of ET as an almost universal tuning<br/>standard in our culture is partially responsible for the evolution of<br/>these harmonies in the first place. There were some influences from<br/>impressionism in France that pushed this evolution, but those<br/>influences had not just a little 12-tET behind them, too.</p><p>Now, in a flexibly pitched ensemble such as an a cappella jazz choir,<br/>even the other side of ET toward Pythagorean may sound better still<br/>to many ears, trading off even further in favor of the fourths and<br/>fifths. But then, barbershop quartets often sing very complex jazz<br/>harmonies that still tend toward JI when the quartet is really good<br/>and well-steeped in that tradition, a tradition that largely went for<br/>very pure, sweet harmonies. Here, I would say, in stark contradicton<br/>to opinions I have expressed in other non-medieval contexts, I have<br/>to agree that it is a matter of taste.</p><p>Cheers to all,</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3><a id=35712 href="#35712">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2002 4:54:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Like the first set of jerries, the first item is a JI triad.

BTW, I suspect that the concept that gives rise to this<br/>particular categorical perception is likely learned from experiencing the<br/>high third--be it physical or psychological. Because it is so widely<br/>experienced, it seems worth our efforts.</p><p>---------</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; you&apos;re talking about singing &apos;into&apos; a heard pitch as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; if it takes place without hearing, via the same hearing mechanism,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; the sung pitch. this sounds like a logical fallacy. and it&apos;s in your<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; *interpretation* of what you experienced -- the experience itself had<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; to involve a single, coherent hearing mechanism.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Are you saying that one can&apos;t hear two things at the same time?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; sure you can -- but you use the same auditory mechanism to hear both<br/>&gt; things. so any psychoacoustical effects which affect one will have to<br/>&gt; affect the other as well.</p><p>Exactly. And that is important to my thinking: in that the high third is<br/>heard only in the context I have described. We can &quot;dissect&quot; it<br/>intellectually by comparing the experience to ones similar in significant<br/>ways. We hear two pitches not only as &quot;two pitches&quot; but as a &quot;relationship<br/>of two pitches&quot; (assuming we have already stored an appropriate concept by<br/>which to recognize it). The same for triads, of course. And that is what we<br/>are dealing with here: a *single* categorical perception of a particular<br/>experience that &quot;should&quot; correspond to a related one (perception of a 4:5<br/>major third) but for some strange reason *doesn&apos;t*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The phrase<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;singing in tune&quot; implies adjusting one&apos;s voice to &quot;fit&quot; with another sound<br/>&gt;&gt; source. That&apos;s what I did in this case. I repeat: when I sang &quot;my version&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; of the JI third with jerry00 there was no pitch difference in our thirds<br/>&gt;&gt; when the root and fifth dropped out; but when I sang the high third (which<br/>&gt;&gt; *also* tuned with the apparent high third being produced by the JI triad)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; this is what is strange. are you saying that if you sang anything<br/>&gt; *between* these two values, it *wouldn&apos;t* fit with the chord, but<br/>&gt; these two values (about 18 cents apart) both *do* fit with the chord?</p><p>That is what I&apos;m saying (and have been saying, in my mind, since the<br/>beginning). That&apos;s why I refer to it as &quot;the&quot; high third. There is a &quot;place&quot;<br/>where it should go. As I said, when my brother sang &quot;his&quot; high third, it<br/>tuned exactly (in my perception) as where I would have tuned it. That&apos;s why<br/>just any old &quot;high third&quot; doesn&apos;t make it. That&apos;s why we were less happy<br/>with most of the other jerries. I said earlier that I&apos;ve probably heard most<br/>of those tunings, but that should not be read to mean that I think they are<br/>&quot;the&quot; high third. Singers can be &quot;out of tune&quot; when singing a unison or when<br/>singing a third--even a &quot;high&quot; one.</p><p>&gt; if true, we&apos;re both very far from postulating any kind of reasonable<br/>&gt; explanation for this. we should at least conduct more tests to verify<br/>&gt; this (if you believe it&apos;s true).</p><p>That might be a good thing to do. First, though, I think it would be good to<br/>see if you can &quot;nail&quot; a jerry that matches my &quot;categorical perception&quot; of a<br/>high third. Once we know what it is in physical terms, we might be better<br/>able to test it psychologically.</p><p>&gt; right now, i&apos;m hesitant to believe<br/>&gt; that the heard interval is a non-monotonic function of the actual<br/>&gt; interval, or anything as &apos;twisted&apos; as that.</p><p>Watch your language, Paul. There may be children on this list! (Besides me.)<br/>What--pray tell--is a non-monotonic function?</p><p>-------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; What are we missing here? I did two different things which produced two<br/>&gt;&gt; different results. Are you suggesting that I didn&apos;t? If so, what created the<br/>&gt;&gt; dissonance in the second case? Interpretation? I don&apos;t think so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i think we&apos;re talking past each other. i&apos;m not doubting that you sang<br/>&gt; a lower and then a higher third. obviously, the higher third would<br/>&gt; have produced beating against the .wav files&apos; lower third. before we<br/>&gt; get mad, let&apos;s remember that communication is not always that easy<br/>&gt; here.</p><p>Mad? Not even a little bit. That paragraph was intended to clarify, not to<br/>inflame. I just haven&apos;t heard (seen) that you have acknowledged this data. I<br/>see now that you have, so the paragraph served it&apos;s purpose. Incidentally, I<br/>have no illusions regarding the difficulty of communication--particularly in<br/>matters that only one of us has first hand experience with. I&apos;m grateful<br/>that you are willing to explore this with me (and us) in order to get closer<br/>to a reasonable description (if not a reasonable explanation).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i&apos;m sticking with my categorical perception hypothesis for now,<br/>&gt; essentially the same hypothesis i offered two years ago.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yes.

Renaissance a cappella music is very triadic<br/>&gt; in its harmonic strucuture; meantone temperaments with pure or quasi-<br/>&gt; pure thirds were the order of the day; so it is natural to sing that<br/>&gt; music with just thirds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My reaction to the &quot;supra-ET&quot; thirds in the jazz chorus and the<br/>&gt; renaissance choirs&apos; contrast with that is simple:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jazz harmonies contain harmonic extensions such as 7ths, 9ths, and<br/>&gt; 13ths (sixths if in close-voiced &quot;6th-9th chords&quot;). Many such chords,<br/>&gt; especially the &quot;6th-9th&quot; chords just mentioned, can be voiced open<br/>&gt; in &quot;stacked fourths&quot; and variations of them such as stacked fourths<br/>&gt; with a third on top or an augmented fourth on the bottom (which is<br/>&gt; the 7th with resepect to the root, the latter of which is generally<br/>&gt; on top in this kind of voicing (e.g. Bb, E, A, D, G, C, which in<br/>&gt; close-voicing with the root at the bottom is C, E, G, Bb, D with an A<br/>&gt; thrown in somewhere, but this voicing is not conducive to the<br/>&gt; presence of the A as &quot;sixth&quot; or &quot;thirteenth&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now we all know that fifths (and fourths, by implication) and thirds<br/>&gt; are not mutually compatible in terms of just tuning. They must be<br/>&gt; traded off with each other. In the renaissance, the tradeoff<br/>&gt; sacrificed the fifths and fourths for the thirds and sixths.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In stacked fourth voicings and any other voicings in jazz harmony<br/>&gt; with equivalent or similar harmonic extensions, a series of fourths<br/>&gt; or fifths that are 5+ cents flat sound terribly flacid, wimpy and<br/>&gt; unconvincing, with none of the sought-for jazzy &quot;bite&quot; and sonority.</p><p>i can think of an interesting exception -- a chord of stacked fourths such as a m11 chord can sound optimal with fourths as much as 9 cents flat.</p><p>&gt; This means the thirds in this context want to get sacrificed for the<br/>&gt; fourths and fifths, so ET works well here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I think the spread of ET as an almost universal tuning<br/>&gt; standard in our culture is partially responsible for the evolution of<br/>&gt; these harmonies in the first place. There were some influences from<br/>&gt; impressionism in France that pushed this evolution, but those<br/>&gt; influences had not just a little 12-tET behind them, too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, in a flexibly pitched ensemble such as an a cappella jazz choir,<br/>&gt; even the other side of ET toward Pythagorean may sound better still<br/>&gt; to many ears, trading off even further in favor of the fourths and<br/>&gt; fifths. But then, barbershop quartets often sing very complex jazz<br/>&gt; harmonies that still tend toward JI when the quartet is really good<br/>&gt; and well-steeped in that tradition, a tradition that largely went for<br/>&gt; very pure, sweet harmonies. Here, I would say, in stark contradicton<br/>&gt; to opinions I have expressed in other non-medieval contexts, I have<br/>&gt; to agree that it is a matter of taste.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers to all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob</p><p>i agree with almost everything you said. in fact, coming back to this post in a few years, you could easily convince me that i wrote it myself! :)</p></div><h3><a id=35717 href="#35717">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2002 5:43:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Watch your language, Paul.

I do pretend<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; to have a 1 cent precision, but the a cappella thirds by trained singers are<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; seemingly much more like JI than 12ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul replied:<br/>&gt;&gt; i think we have a general consensus that this is true for renaissance<br/>&gt;&gt; and early baroque specializing choirs. however, jerry is claiming<br/>&gt;&gt; that other choirs, such as his, the los angeles jazz choir, usually<br/>&gt;&gt; sing a major third *higher* than 12-equal in the context of full<br/>&gt;&gt; major triads. this is the &apos;mystery&apos;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I used renaissance and early baroque corpus because I want to start simple.<br/>&gt; A cappella remove the influence of rigidly tuned instrument. Early music<br/>&gt; specialized choirs or vocal ensemble use generally very small vibrato; as<br/>&gt; vibrato blurs the pitch, it makes accurate measurement nearly impossible for<br/>&gt; reasonably long chords (beware, I do not say that early music specialist are<br/>&gt; more just! there are just easier to take measure from!).</p><p>Paul, I wonder if that is why you and others believe the JI third is<br/>peculiar to early music. For what it&apos;s worth, most of the choirs I hear and<br/>deal with (both church and college) in virtually all musical styles (unless<br/>singing with an organ) tune final major chords with the the high third<br/>(which, judging from our research here, is probably JI).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you can provide me with MP3 sample of chords, I may try to give an<br/>&gt; opinion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; about high third<br/>&gt; ----------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; For the jerries, the peaks broaden around the maximum and is about 15 Hz<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; wide at -40 dB.

I do not know<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; if this &quot;noise&quot; is perceptively significant and if so how it is perceived. I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; can make the hypothesis that this so called &quot;noise&quot; may give the rugosity<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; (to not say &quot;harshness&quot; that may be pejorative) that may give the illusion<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; that the third is not just.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; This is just an out-of-the-blue hypothesis.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gerald replied:<br/>&gt;&gt; When you say &quot;the jerries,&quot; do you mean all of them. Only jerry00 is JI. The<br/>&gt;&gt; others would naturally contain some dissonance since their thirds are not in<br/>&gt;&gt; small-number agreement with the other elements. Is there a difference in<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;rugosity&quot; (nice word) between jerry00 and the others?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes all of them have broad resonances instead of sharp peak seen on rigidly<br/>&gt; tuned acoustic instrument.</p><p>By &quot;broad resonances&quot; are you referring to the rounded tops I see in the<br/>wave form?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Psychoacoustic sources cited by Paul may support the hypothesis that what I<br/>&gt; identified as &quot;noise&quot; may be responsible for the perceptual stretching of<br/>&gt; the third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am really sorry about that, but I do no perceived any high third in<br/>&gt; jerry00. I heard that the others are out of tune but I cannot say if the<br/>&gt; thirds are high or low. It is probably a bias due to the practice of amateur<br/>&gt; chorus; when something goes wrong, there is hardly anything like a high<br/>&gt; third: there is always somebody too low :-)</p><p>Not sure what this means. My &quot;amateur&quot; college choruses easily learn how to<br/>tune simply by listening to combined pitches *without* the &quot;help&quot; of the<br/>piano.

I will call them &quot;supra-<br/>&gt; ET&quot; thirds.</p><p>Hi, Bob. Nice to be acknowledged, even in third person. I guess you didn&apos;t<br/>see my posts directly intended for you. Welcome back. Good timing!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree that the best renaissance a cappella choirs sing just thirds.<br/>&gt; The ones that don&apos;t are simply demonstrating relative incompetence<br/>&gt; vis-a-vis those that do. Renaissance a cappella music is very triadic<br/>&gt; in its harmonic strucuture; meantone temperaments with pure or quasi-<br/>&gt; pure thirds were the order of the day; so it is natural to sing that<br/>&gt; music with just thirds.</p><p>Here&apos;s the issue, Robert. Suppose a &quot;best&quot; choir responsibly and knowingly<br/>sings JI thirds, but &quot;less hip&quot; ears *hear* those JI thirds as &quot;high&quot;<br/>thirds. Does that make the listeners &quot;incompetent&quot;? Suppose those listeners<br/>sing in other choirs and attempt to tune carefully as they re-create the<br/>music of the Renaissance; and in the process those choirs sing the high<br/>thirds they &quot;think&quot; they heard upon listening to the &quot;best&quot; choirs.</p><p>Suppose you were able to go back to the Renaissance and actually *hear* what<br/>sort of thirds choirs were singing then. Is it completely out of the realm<br/>of possibility that some of those sixteenth century ears heard a difference<br/>between a third sung with root and third sounding and one sung with root<br/>alone? How would you know? Would you ask them? Would you assume that *they*<br/>would know? Are you sure historians would know for sure?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My reaction to the &quot;supra-ET&quot; thirds in the jazz chorus and the<br/>&gt; renaissance choirs&apos; contrast with that is simple:</p><p>Be careful of the word &quot;simple.&quot; Simplicity can sometimes be just as<br/>illusive as a the truth about high thirds. I used to think high thirds were<br/>&quot;simply&quot; the only ones anyone used. I don&apos;t think that anymore. And, as we<br/>all now know, the world is not &quot;simply&quot; flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jazz harmonies contain harmonic extensions such as 7ths, 9ths, and<br/>&gt; 13ths (sixths if in close-voiced &quot;6th-9th chords&quot;). Many such chords,<br/>&gt; especially the &quot;6th-9th&quot; chords just mentioned, can be voiced open<br/>&gt; in &quot;stacked fourths&quot; and variations of them such as stacked fourths<br/>&gt; with a third on top or an augmented fourth on the bottom (which is<br/>&gt; the 7th with resepect to the root, the latter of which is generally<br/>&gt; on top in this kind of voicing (e.g. Bb, E, A, D, G, C, which in<br/>&gt; close-voicing with the root at the bottom is C, E, G, Bb, D with an A<br/>&gt; thrown in somewhere, but this voicing is not conducive to the<br/>&gt; presence of the A as &quot;sixth&quot; or &quot;thirteenth&quot;).</p><p>Sounds like a hypothesis worth discussing sometime. Actually, it has nothing<br/>to do with the high third we&apos;re talking about here. Here&apos;s the set up:</p><p>    Play a low C and ask the basses to match it. Then ask the women to tune<br/>a tenth above it. Once tuned, compare it to the piano&apos;s E and notice that it<br/>is as one would think--slightly below. No surprise.</p><p>    Then play a low C and ask the basses to match it and ask the tenors to<br/>tune a perfect fifth above it. When the perfect fifth is in evidence, again<br/>ask the women to tune a tenth above the bass. Note that their &quot;third&quot; will<br/>be higher than the piano&apos;s third. *Big* surprise!</p><p>It works *every* time. I&apos;ve demonstrated it with my choirs, other people&apos;s<br/>choirs, and on the road with choral festival choirs I&apos;ve never met.</p><p>No 7ths, 9ths and 13ths. No 6-9 chords. Just a simple major triad. Just like<br/>in Renaissance endings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now we all know that fifths (and fourths, by implication) and thirds<br/>&gt; are not mutually compatible in terms of just tuning. They must be<br/>&gt; traded off with each other. In the renaissance, the tradeoff<br/>&gt; sacrificed the fifths and fourths for the thirds and sixths.</p><p>Tradeoff? Huh? Clearly, we *all* don&apos;t know this. How do *you* know this?<br/>Makes no sense to me at all. But, I&apos;m all ears! Enlighten me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In stacked fourth voicings and any other voicings in jazz harmony<br/>&gt; with equivalent or similar harmonic extensions, a series of fourths<br/>&gt; or fifths that are 5+ cents flat sound terribly flacid, wimpy and<br/>&gt; unconvincing, with none of the sought-for jazzy &quot;bite&quot; and sonority.<br/>&gt; This means the thirds in this context want to get sacrificed for the<br/>&gt; fourths and fifths, so ET works well here.</p><p>I found that ET didn&apos;t work at all for jazz chords. That&apos;s why I asked my<br/>rehearsal pianist to stop playing chords while the singers were *seeking*<br/>their tunings. Only when he simply provided bass roots did our hot vocal<br/>chords find their jazzy &quot;bite.&quot; By the way, our thirds were not ET; they<br/>were &quot;high.&quot; Always! Just like our Renaissance endings.</p><p>Whether they were high because they were *sung* high or because they<br/>*sounded* high is what this discussion is all about.</p><p>So, there you have it, Robert. Welcome to the discussion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, I think the spread of ET as an almost universal tuning<br/>&gt; standard in our culture is partially responsible for the evolution of<br/>&gt; these harmonies in the first place.</p><p>I believe ET is the curse of fine tuning in our culture. Train a choir to<br/>sing &quot;piano pitch&quot; and I assure you it will be flat within two minutes<br/>unless the piano is there to bolster it.</p><p>&gt; There were some influences from<br/>&gt; impressionism in France that pushed this evolution, but those<br/>&gt; influences had not just a little 12-tET behind them, too.</p><p>Gershwin would likely agree with you. But then you should hear what Gershwin<br/>can sound like when sung by pitch-sensitive singers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, in a flexibly pitched ensemble such as an a cappella jazz choir,</p><p>The LA Jazz Choir sang with piano, bass and drums. However, the pianist was<br/>always instructed not to comp when the choir was singing harmony and never<br/>to play the same melodic lines the choir was singing. It worked fine. But<br/>you are correct that the vocals were &quot;flexibly pitched,&quot; and certainly not<br/>ET (which you suggested above is conducive to jazz tuning).</p><p> &gt; even the other side of ET toward Pythagorean may sound better still<br/>&gt; to many ears,</p><p>last year, we explored the possibility that the Pythagorean third was the<br/>preferred &quot;high third.&quot; We all seemed to agree that it was not. Way too<br/>high.</p><p>&gt; trading off even further in favor of the fourths and<br/>&gt; fifths. But then, barbershop quartets often sing very complex jazz<br/>&gt; harmonies that still tend toward JI when the quartet is really good<br/>&gt; and well-steeped in that tradition, a tradition that largely went for<br/>&gt; very pure, sweet harmonies.

At the risk of<br/>excessive repetition from my earlier posts, I hear *ONE* good third<br/>in Jerry00 and it sounds &quot;normal&quot;! A good, JI major triad is the<br/>felicitous result. I hear no secondary &quot;high&quot; third. I DO notice a<br/>tendency to perceive a subjective drop in pitch that is *nulled out*<br/>with careful, focused attention on the third througout Jerry00.<br/>However, more casual listening does create this subjective effect,<br/>although even then I hear a good, solid JI third as *dropping* to a<br/>pitch that to my ear seems to go *flat* to the JI third in the triad.</p><p>I just posted a suggestion in a related thread. (These posts seem to<br/>be producing various kinds of progeny at an alarming rate and making<br/>things difficult to follow). I fail to see the point of raising the<br/>third in the context of the triad as was done in these examples<br/>(Jerries 01-07), since that is apparently already the natural<br/>direction of the illusion when referenced to the later stand-alone<br/>third.</p><p>Why not instead tune the third justly as in Jerry00 and then raise<br/>the pitch by small increments in each subsequent example right when<br/>the root and fifth drop out to see how much we have to raise it to<br/>hear the pitch as staying the same under the casual listening<br/>circumstance? I&apos;m sure it would be different for different listeners.<br/>This would be most interesting to me!</p><p>With all due respect, playing with a &quot;real high third&quot; that<br/>disappears into the JI major triad seems to me as futile as Ponce de<br/>Leon&apos;s search for the Fountain of Youth. I can see nothing in this<br/>subjective pitch drop phenomenon that would even begin to imply such<br/>possibility.</p><p>I think the root of this strangeness is taking the stand-alone third<br/>as the reference point and then concluding that its insertion into a<br/>triad raises its subjective pitch. It&apos;s all relative, of course. It<br/>does indeed do that with respect to its stand-alone subjective pitch<br/>station. But even taking this perspective, if its insertion into the<br/>triad raises its subjective pitch, why should artifically mistuning<br/>to raising it even further be of any value?</p><p>I see the third&apos;s position in a pure JI triad as its defining<br/>situation, and the subjective drop when it is sounding alone should<br/>be referenced to that. Then we can play with that last stand-alone<br/>pitch to see how far we need to raise it to subjectively match the JI<br/>pitch in harmonic context. We&apos;ll see, I&apos;m convinced, that some<br/>people&apos;s ears are much closer or farther from the objective realities<br/>of frequency measurement than others. I would expect the subjective<br/>pitch perceptions of highly competent professional piano tuning<br/>technicians, for example, to be generally more accurately correlated<br/>to *frequency* than others under many such anomalous perceptual<br/>circumstances.</p></div><h3><a id=35770 href="#35770">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2002 12:48:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Okay, how about this?

I know you believe you can as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So why shouldn&apos;t it sound &quot;normal&quot; in the context of a perfectly<br/>&gt; &gt; tuned 4:5:6 triad using a harmonic timbre?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The point here, of course, is that the JI third doesn&apos;t sound the<br/>same as a<br/>&gt; &quot;normal&quot; 4:5 dyad when sounding with both root and fifth. There is a<br/>&gt; difference. And that difference seems to me to &quot;move&quot; the third<br/>higher. If<br/>&gt; you prefer to call that &quot;normal,&quot; I have no particular problem with<br/>it. It&apos;s<br/>&gt; just that I think it less troublesome to refer to the simple 4:5<br/>third as<br/>&gt; &quot;normal&quot; and the illusory modification (if that&apos;s what it is)<br/>as &quot;high.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On the contrary, the pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; drop illusion makes it sound to my ear as if it went flat from<br/>&gt; &gt; its &quot;normal&quot; just position in subjective pitch space.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay. At least now we understand each other.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It seems clear some of us are agreed that the cleanly tuned third<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; Jerry00 sounds subjectively higher in harmonic context than when<br/>&gt; &gt; alone (although it is a low third compared to most current musical<br/>&gt; &gt; contexts and takes some initial getting used to for most). So why<br/>&gt; &gt; should we design an experiment in which the third is tuned even<br/>&gt; &gt; higher than its pure triadic position when the latter is<br/>apparently<br/>&gt; &gt; responsible for this very subjective impression of highness?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Only because I realize that singers tend to actually *sing* a pitch<br/>at or<br/>&gt; near where the illusionary one seems to appear. Whether that is<br/>actually<br/>&gt; true may be evident when Paul produces the next set of jerries.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would think it should be more revealing to play the perfectly<br/>tuned<br/>&gt; &gt; triad and then move the pitch up slightly right when the root and<br/>&gt; &gt; fifth drop out.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who knows? Maybe we instinctively do that. I would think so.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We could check various options to see how much upward<br/>&gt; &gt; movement it takes to null the subjective drop in different<br/>people&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; ears. That would be truly interesting, don&apos;t you think?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, yeah. But *you* do this one, Bob. I&apos;ve got to knock this stuff<br/>off soon<br/>&gt; and get back to *real* work. ;-)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=35792 href="#35792">ðŸ”—</a>robert_wendell &#x3C;rwendell@cangelic.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/19/2002 9:27:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul asked me offline to listen again to see whether I hear the pitch<br/>drop only for the justly tuned Jerry00 triad after the root and fifth<br/>drop out, or hear the same or similar pitch drops for all the<br/>Jerries.

I further speculate that this may be due to not<br/>&gt; &gt; having the reference point that makes their sharpness evident,<br/>and<br/>&gt; so the perception of sharpness disappears upon removing the<br/>reference<br/>&gt; to the root an fifth.

The experiment is set up the same way for<br/>&gt; all of them, no??<br/>&gt;<br/>Bob now:<br/>I just mean that the justness of the third in Jerry00 in the context<br/>of the open fifth surrounding it is a reference point I&apos;m used to<br/>dealing with. I know melodically on the violin and with my voice<br/>right where a just third is. (I don&apos;t experience this shift in<br/>practice to anything like the degree I did initially in Jerry00, and<br/>assume that this is owing to the greater complexity of the harmonic<br/>content in the Jerry.)</p><p>So with the other Jerries 01-17, since they&apos;re floating around up<br/>there somewhere in pitch limbo above the justly tuned reference<br/>point, I don&apos;t have as clear a reference when the root and fifth drop<br/>out to tell me they&apos;re sharp, so maybe that&apos;s why they appear to drop<br/>even after the just third in Jerry00 has ceased to do so.</p><p>Hope that clarifies my statements a little.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p></div><h3><a id=35832 href="#35832">ðŸ”—</a>robert_wendell &#x3C;rwendell@cangelic.org&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2002 10:06:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Jerry. Well, I don&apos;t remember the experiment you suggested for my<br/>choir, so feel free to remind me, please. On our hearing the same<br/>thing, I did initially hear (on repeated trials) a difference between<br/>the Jerry00 third in the context of the triad and the stand-alone<br/>third later. Although it apparently dropped in pitch after the root<br/>and  fifth dropped out, I did not initially hear it as &quot;high&quot;.</p><p>This illusory drop does not follow that kind of logic for me. The<br/>third in context sounded and continues to sound like the beautiful<br/>low just thirds (vis-a-vis 12-tET thirds) I know and love. It DOES<br/>NOT AND NEVER HAS sounded high to me. The apparent drop in pitch<br/>after the removal of the rest of the triad has no bearing on that for<br/>me. It just seemed EVEN LOWER than the low just third. Even that<br/>phenomenon has disappeared for me however, to my surprise as I<br/>mentioned in an earlier post.</p><p>How this drop implies a &quot;real&quot; high third to you or to your ear is a<br/>total mystery to me. I have nothing against trying to chase this<br/>down, but it&apos;s a perception that for me personally has absoutely no<br/>meaning. The third is just, not high. It&apos;s apparent drop does not<br/>imply that it was really high before. It certainly doesn&apos;t imply<br/>logically or perceptually to me that there is a &quot;real&quot; third up there<br/>higher somewhere. Where is that logic (or percpetion) coming from.<br/>How does low going lower imply anything higher?! Truthfully, I just<br/>don&apos;t hear or logically comprehend what you&apos;re getting at.</p><p>Respectfully,</p><p>Bob</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; On 3/19/02 8:34 PM, &quot;tuning@y...&quot; &lt;tuning@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>______________________________________________________________________<br/>__<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Message: 6<br/>&gt; &gt;  Date: Tue, 19 Mar 2002 22:36:04 -0000<br/>&gt; &gt;  From: &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;rwendell@c...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Jerries: a conclusion or two<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; (Bob offers an hypothesis at bottom.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; In this case, the sound of jerry00 is heard as one element in the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; experience, complete with its &quot;high third.&quot; Another element is<br/>the sound of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; my voice, which I can manipulate independent of the jerry.

Although it apparently dropped in pitch after the root<br/>&gt; and  fifth dropped out, I did not initially hear it as &quot;high&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This illusory drop does not follow that kind of logic for me. The<br/>&gt; third in context sounded and continues to sound like the beautiful<br/>&gt; low just thirds (vis-a-vis 12-tET thirds) I know and love. It DOES<br/>&gt; NOT AND NEVER HAS sounded high to me. The apparent drop in pitch<br/>&gt; after the removal of the rest of the triad has no bearing on that for<br/>&gt; me. It just seemed EVEN LOWER than the low just third. Even that<br/>&gt; phenomenon has disappeared for me however, to my surprise as I<br/>&gt; mentioned in an earlier post.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How this drop implies a &quot;real&quot; high third to you or to your ear is a<br/>&gt; total mystery to me. I have nothing against trying to chase this<br/>&gt; down, but it&apos;s a perception that for me personally has absoutely no<br/>&gt; meaning. The third is just, not high. It&apos;s apparent drop does not<br/>&gt; imply that it was really high before. It certainly doesn&apos;t imply<br/>&gt; logically or perceptually to me that there is a &quot;real&quot; third up there<br/>&gt; higher somewhere. Where is that logic (or percpetion) coming from.<br/>&gt; How does low going lower imply anything higher?!

I trust you will set it up<br/>in an objective manner so as not to influence the result.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In spite of going back even as far as Jascha Heifetz, with his<br/>&gt; tendency to use high thirds melodically, on his famous recordings of<br/>&gt; the Bach Unaccompanied Sonatas and Partitas for Violin he plays just<br/>&gt; double and multiple stops, and his arpeggios and scales, in this<br/>&gt; context at least, generally tend to be also just. I find this to be<br/>&gt; almost universally true of the best violinists. Certainly this<br/>&gt; applies to Perlman and Pinkerman.</p><p>The use of &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; thirds is in a real sense a matter of artistic<br/>taste. I think we settled that long ago. (Somewhat)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Specifically for Jerry:<br/>&gt; Please let me know if what follows is an accurate summary of your<br/>&gt; hypotheses regarding your &quot;high third&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1) A 4:5:6 triad is played, then the root and fifth (4, 6) drop out<br/>&gt; and only the third is left, frequency and timbre unchanged.</p><p>Okay.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2) Most people hear a subjective drop in pitch in the third when the<br/>&gt; root and fifth drop out, despite the lack of any objective change.</p><p>Okay. But I think of it the other way around--that &quot;most people&quot; hear the<br/>third higher than ET when the root and fifth are sounding. Whether it&apos;s<br/>objectively unchanged is not a settled issue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) Because of this relative difference in pitch, you define the<br/>&gt; perceived pitch of the 4:5 third when in context with the full triad<br/>&gt; as a &quot;high third&quot;, regardless of the absence of any change in<br/>&gt; frequency and timbre, using the stand-alone third as a reference to<br/>&gt; define &quot;high&quot;.</p><p>The &quot;stand-alone&quot; third is a reference to &quot;low.&quot; The high third is so<br/>defined because it appears to be higher than the &quot;stand-alone&quot; (in relation<br/>to the remembered root) third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4) You postulate that musicians sensitive to small pitch inflections<br/>&gt; of this order of magnitude tend to compensate by raising the &quot;stand-<br/>&gt; alone&quot; third in frequency to subjectively match the pitch heard in<br/>&gt; context with the triad. This new stand-alone third is now literally a<br/>&gt; high third vis-a-vis the frequency of the just 4:5 third; even higher<br/>&gt; than a 12-tET third.</p><p>Actually, the &quot;musicians&quot; I have observed include totally uninitiated<br/>beginners. That, in my thinking, eliminates the idea that such tuning is<br/>learned from experience. It has to be psycho-acoustic.</p><p>Nevertheless, it may also be true that some experienced musicians who may<br/>have heard the psycho-acoustic high third all of their musical lives (like<br/>me) actually perform the &quot;high&quot; third as an &quot;in tune&quot; component in a major<br/>triad. That&apos;s why I would like to know if, as I said before, the damn thing<br/>works in reverse.</p><p>So, there actually may be *two* high thirds--the psycho-acoustic one and the<br/>physical one. That is the issue here, as I see it. (Paul, of course, may<br/>have another point of view.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 5) You further postulate that this conditions musicians&apos; ears to<br/>&gt; inject this literally higher third back into the triad as is, a third<br/>&gt; that is actually high, and that this literally high third now in<br/>&gt; context with the full triad is not beatless, since it is now even<br/>&gt; more sharp to just than a 12-tET third.</p><p>That&apos;s it. You&apos;ve got it. I think it probably happens because I&apos;ve heard it<br/>discussed among my pro singers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 6) Finally, you also postulate that musicians hear this literally<br/>&gt; sharp high third, because of the aforementioned conditioning of the<br/>&gt; musicians&apos; ears, as in tune even in context with the original<br/>&gt; unchanged root and fifth, in spite of its not being a beatless third.</p><p>Uh huh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please, Jerry, let me know whether this is an accurate summary of<br/>&gt; your thinking, and if not, please specify in what ways it deviates<br/>&gt; from your position.</p><p>Yep. That&apos;s it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob<br/>&gt;<br/>And even more thanks to you, Robert, for taking the time to understand what<br/>it is I&apos;ve been talking about.</p><p>Incidentally, I have nothing to prove here. I just want to know what&apos;s going<br/>on. Your experienced ear will certainly help (actually has). I&apos;m glad you&apos;re<br/>back. And Thanks to Paul for suggesting I return to the list.</p><p>Okay, now do that &quot;experiment&quot; with your singers and let us know what<br/>happens.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=35932 href="#35932">ðŸ”—</a>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2002 7:04:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 3/28/02 12:18 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>Joseph wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***This is really interesting because I was a little confused about<br/>&gt; the part about putting the &quot;third back in...&quot; as a higher one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In fact, if the third really *is* higher than 400 cents then this<br/>&gt; isn&apos;s so much a &quot;psychoacoustic&quot; phenomenon as a &quot;reality.&quot;</p><p>I think it *can* be, Joseph.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seemed to me, more, along the lines of what Bob is saying here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; a &quot;just&quot; third is a &quot;just&quot; third... it only *sounds* different when<br/>&gt; there is a fifth present.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe Bob believes that as well (??)</p><p>I&apos;m still waiting for him to clarify that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But it still means that singers (particularly) and instrumentalists<br/>&gt; still tune to a &quot;beatless&quot; third, only that the *PERCEPTION* and not<br/>&gt; the actual *FREQUENCY* of the third is changing...</p><p>While your experience appears to be a &quot;listening&quot; one, I think you likely<br/>can appreciate the notion that singers and string players might begin to<br/>&quot;believe&quot; the pitch they have been hearing and then actually produce it.<br/>Very likely, *both* things happen--hearing and doing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, I have to admit with the limited experimenting I did here, that<br/>&gt; the just third really *does* sound different when there is a fifth<br/>&gt; present...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; jp</p><p>Yeah.

He didn&apos;t need to *learn* to hear it. One can<br/>*choose* to focus on the 4:5 third or to focus on the illusionary &quot;high&quot;<br/>third.

[And how! I<br/>can&apos;t recognize much of what I said in the strange interpretations<br/>that are bouncing back here. With all due respect, these conclusions<br/>about what I&apos;m saying baffle me as much as the theory we&apos;re trying to<br/>evaluate does. I try to be clear and unambiguous in terms of the<br/>knowledge and established contexts I tend to assume we share here,<br/>unless we go back to square one and explain every concept from<br/>scratch...]</p><p>it&apos;s only your<br/>&gt; interpretation that he experienced the illusionary high third.<br/>&gt; nothing he said suggests that he *necessarily* did.<br/>[Right again! I only noticed the well-documented drop in subjective<br/>pitch when the root and fifth drop out. If you want to use that<br/>subjectively lowered pitch as the reference and designate as higher<br/>the previous pitch perception of the same frequency in the context of<br/>the just triad (yes, *FREQUENCY*, since that is the objective<br/>reference used for JI), then fine! I have no objection to that. Just<br/>don&apos;t call it a &quot;high third&quot;, since it is simply a JI 4:5 third in<br/>context with the triad and is only subjectively higher in pitch (for<br/>some) than the stand-alone third.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hold on, Bob. When you first heard jerry00, you described the<br/>third<br/>&gt; in the<br/>&gt; &gt; triad as the &quot;right&quot; third and the naked third as flat.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; that&apos;s not quite right. he said the pitch of the note that was the<br/>&gt; third in the triad went down after its harmonic context had been<br/>&gt; removed. sure, one possible interpretation of that is in terms of<br/>&gt; your current &apos;illusionary high third&apos; theory. another<br/>interpretation<br/>&gt; i gave in terms of known psychoacoustical phenomena. BUT, NB: he<br/>&gt; *still* hears the thirds of jerry01, jerry02, etc. though jerry07<br/>go<br/>&gt; down after *their* triadic contexts are removed. these are not just<br/>&gt; thirds -- far from it. so how would your current theory account for<br/>&gt; that?<br/>[Right again, Paul! You seems to understand me clearly. Wish<br/>everybody did.]</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Evidently, it hadn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; occurred to you before that there even *was* a difference between<br/>a<br/>&gt; dyad<br/>&gt; &gt; third and a triad third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; dyad third? excuse me, there was no dyad in any of the listening<br/>&gt; experiments.<br/>[True. There weren&apos;t, and I was deliberately remaining ignorant of<br/>the previous discussions until after I hear the &quot;Jerries&quot;, so I<br/>didn&apos;t even know what I was supposed to be listening for. I just<br/>described in detail what I perceived and my reactions to that. Any<br/>comments from me about dyads came in later follow-up discussions.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; However, from extensive personal experience with highly precise<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tuning both of instruments like the piano, synthesizers, and<br/>&gt; dynamic<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tuning of violin and voice, I had learned that the ear tends<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to &quot;objectify&quot; its perceptions over time to accord more<br/>precisely<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with the measurable parameters such as frequency. I had<br/>expressed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; this point of view clearly at the outset in my responses to this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thread.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Frequency? Are you suggesting that so-called &quot;perfect pitch&quot; can<br/>be<br/>&gt; learned?<br/>&gt; &gt; If so, that&apos;s pretty radical.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; bob simply means things such as frequency ratios -- this has<br/>nothing<br/>&gt; to do with perfect pitch. [Right again. None of my statements<br/>depend upon or imply any need for developing absolute pitch.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have long been convinced for example that the famous curves<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; relating frequency and pitch using naive listeners are not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; representative of highly musical ears highly experienced with<br/>&gt; precise<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tuning. The correlation of pitch with frequency is rather<br/>skewed,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with the naive ear hearing very sharp pitches in the higher<br/>&gt; ranges as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in tune and what I would call clean pitches as flat. I have run<br/>&gt; into<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; this with amateur sopranos in their high range and it usually<br/>&gt; takes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; quite some doing to get them over this.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Don&apos;t confuse ordinary out-of-tune sopranos with illusionary<br/>&gt; *relative*<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch perceptions. Such poor intonation would likely not result<br/>&gt; from seeking<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic consonance with other singers. In my experience, those<br/>&gt; sharp<br/>&gt; &gt; sopranos are not listening to much other than their own voices.<br/>&gt; (Probably<br/>&gt; &gt; singing pitches &quot;learned&quot; from listening to the piano.)<br/>[I have exstensive experience, Jerry, with very inexperienced amateur<br/>(and some experienced professional) singers who have what I call<br/>a &quot;pitch bias&quot; or &quot;perpetual pitch offset&quot;. It is flat for most<br/>voices. I jokingly refer to what I call the &quot;saddly sagging tenor<br/>syndrome&quot;. It&apos;s almost universal in the states and to some degree in<br/>Europe. You find it even in well-known professional choral ensembles.<br/>Very rarely do you find such a perpetual bias to the sharp side<br/>except in sopranos. Sure, other voices and even more experienced<br/>sopranos can temporarily &quot;overheat&quot; on a crescendo and drive the<br/>pitch sharp, especially if they&apos;re not attentive to pitch enough to<br/>invoke the intuitive physical adjustments needed to compensate a<br/>crescendo and maintain a constant pitch despite it. However, it is<br/>not at all rare to find sopranos with a perpetual sharp offset. I<br/>believe that this discrepancy among voice parts is likely due to the<br/>pitch/frequency correlations documented in the experiments using<br/>relatively untrained subjects. None of the other voices overlap much<br/>of the range where this sharp bias shows up in these curves.]</p><p>&gt; bob is referring to the well-known psychoacoustical phenomenon in<br/>&gt; which, especially given a sine-wave timbre, subjects invariably<br/>&gt; choose melodic octaves slightly *wider* than 2:1 as &quot;correct&quot;.<br/>[Yes again. This research was cited by Paul in the<br/>discussions following the Jerries examples, and the apparent total<br/>lack of any conceptual linkage to that in this response baffles me<br/>once again. If we have to re-establish context every time we respond,<br/>this is going to be a hopeless little, or maybe big, journey.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; This learning experience has taught me that the ear learns to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; correlate frequency and pitch in an increasingly objective way.<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore feel that those with poor intonation sense have simply<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not &quot;objectified&quot; their ears in this way and thus easily fall<br/>&gt; prey to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; whatever psychoacoustic anomolies might assail them.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know what you are saying here, Bob. My ear (which I&apos;m<br/>quite<br/>&gt; sure is<br/>&gt; &gt; not a &quot;na&iuml;ve&quot; one) cannot *hear* frequency. (It can&apos;t even<br/>count<br/>to<br/>&gt; ten.) My<br/>&gt; &gt; ear also cannot *hear* pitch out of tonal context, in the sense<br/>of<br/>&gt; naming it<br/>&gt; &gt; Eb or F#. So what do you mean by the phrase &quot;correlate frequency<br/>&gt; and pitch&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; he means, for example, hearing 2:1 melodic octaves as &quot;in tune&quot;<br/>&gt; (though i question whether even bob could do this with sine waves<br/>in<br/>&gt; an extreme register).<br/>[Right, Paul. Again, all reference to the cited research seems to<br/>have been lost here. The closest objective correlate to pitch that<br/>any of us know about is frequency. The whole Jerries experiment would<br/>be meaningless without the experimental controls in terms of<br/>frequency, so why are we trying to throw it out here?]<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; There are without any doubt, as I see it, psychoacoustic<br/>phenomena<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that predispose naive ears towards perceptions that do not<br/>support<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; miminum tuning dissonance in the context of harmony, i.e., JI<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; harmony.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And what might those be?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; geez, i thought i gave an goodly number of examples of these types<br/>of<br/>&gt; psychoacoustical phenomena already -- several weeks ago if i<br/>remember<br/>&gt; correctly.<br/>[Is the psychoacoustic phenomenon we&apos;re discussing, namely the<br/>subjective pitch difference in a tone of constant *FREQUENCY* with a<br/>change in context, not a case in point!!!!???? ...Is not this<br/>whole &quot;high third&quot; theory based on the idea that this phenomenon<br/>conditions some people&apos;s ears to re-inject into a triad a third that<br/>is higher to a just third than even 12-EDO thirds? Is that not a<br/>psychoacoustic phenomenon that by your own explicit agreement in a<br/>previous post predisposes the ear away from JI, Jerry? How did we<br/>get this lost? I was not being in the least abstract here, but rather<br/>referring directly to the phenomenon under discussion!]<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet the tuning dissonances that arise in sufficiently non-JI<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; harmonies do not go away simply because some of these phenomena<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; predispose the ear away from JI.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Did anyone here say that dissonance goes away because of<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic<br/>&gt; &gt; phenomena?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; no. bob is just completing the logic in his argument, not<br/>suggesting<br/>&gt; that anyone said this in particular.<br/>[Well, I&apos;m not sure I confine myself to that, Paul. It is true that I<br/>am just completing the logic of my argument here, and meant nothing<br/>behond that. Jerry has clearly stated, and reconfirmed my summary to<br/>this effect, that his reinjected, literally supra-ET high third<br/>sounds &quot;in tune&quot; to his ear. To me that implies that this deceptive<br/>pitch illusion we&apos;re dealing with somehow generates for some<br/>musicians&apos; ears a new pitch that is &quot;away from JI&quot;,...one that he<br/>feels sounds &quot;in tune&quot;, whatever that could possibly mean in this<br/>context. If &quot;in tune&quot; means &quot;no tuning dissonance&quot; or even &quot;reduced<br/>tuning dissonance&quot;, then he has clearly implied that somehow the<br/>tuning dissonance of his literally high third has been ameliorated by<br/>a psychoacoustic phenomenon that predisposes the ear away from JI.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bob, I appreciate your time and effort here but this makes little<br/>&gt; sense to<br/>&gt; &gt; me. You clearly believe &quot;something&quot; but what it is doesn&apos;t strike<br/>&gt; any<br/>&gt; &gt; familiar chords in my musical experience.<br/>[Well, again with all due respect, Jerry, I think I have probably<br/>made it abundantly clear that your musical experiences, at least as<br/>described in the current discussion, are at least as completely alien<br/>to me. So I would be surprised if my experiences mapped nicely into<br/>yours. I don&apos;t think that we can can reasonably expect one to map<br/>into the other without it being mutual.]</p><p>&gt; i have the exact opposite reaction. bob, in fact, has struck so<br/>many<br/>&gt; familiar chords in my musical experience since joining this list<br/>last<br/>&gt; year, that &apos;meeting&apos; him will be an experience i&apos;ll never forget.<br/>but<br/>&gt; that&apos;s besides the point -- again, i&apos;m not trying to side with him<br/>&gt; against you or anything like that -- my motto here is &quot;jus&apos; da<br/>facts,<br/>&gt; man&quot;.<br/>[Well, I don&apos;t think human feelings should be beside the point here.<br/>It is not my intention to hurt anyone&apos;s feelings, and hope I haven&apos;t.<br/>Paul and I have certainly had our scraps here, as anyone who has been<br/>here for awhile or looked thoroughly through the archives must know.<br/>However, Paul&apos;s challenges to my thinking have deepened my<br/>understanding very substantially. I hope this is true for Jerry, too.<br/>I respect Paul as extremely erudite, a professional blues guitarist<br/>(I love it!) and practicing microtonalist (witness his guitar<br/>collection), and mathematician, who is also incredibly well-versed in<br/>tuning history and stylistic evolution from medieval times and even<br/>much earlier. I love that we can discuss jazz, blues, &quot;classical&quot;,<br/>middle eastern, and other ethnic music with him and he&apos;s right on top<br/>of it. Fantastic! I have utmost respect for you, Paul, and your words<br/>really warm my heart.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; By the way, now that you have disposed of &quot;na&iuml;ve&quot; ears, does<br/>that<br/>&gt; mean you<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t intend to do the &quot;experiment&quot; with your choir?<br/>[Please do not take my phrase &quot;naive ears&quot; out of the context in<br/>which it was used, namely the psychoacoustic experiments correlating<br/>pitch and frequency that Paul recognized as my reference above. I did<br/>refer to them as &quot;the famous pitch/frequency correlation curves&quot; or<br/>something like that. The subjects in those experiments were not<br/>experts in tuning anything. I am not so up on these things that I<br/>remember specific references, and am therefore unable to document<br/>things as if I were writing a thesis.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i hope he will do the &quot;experiment&quot;. i&apos;m sure there has to be a good<br/>&gt; explanation for what you&apos;re hearing, jerry, in regard to intonation<br/>&gt; differences in the 2:5 dyad vs. in the 2:3:5 triad (don&apos;t say 4:5:6<br/>&gt; unless that&apos;s what you really want in these experiments). but as<br/>for<br/>&gt; your current theory on the matter, i think jerry10.wav is the best<br/>&gt; test of it yet. unfortunately, you and i are the only people who<br/>have<br/>&gt; listened to it. come on, folks! is *anyone* out there?</p><p>[I will listen soon.

We just finished a very successful performance for the local<br/>community concert association.

It&apos;s irrelevant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Evidently, it hadn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt; occurred to you before that there even *was* a difference between a dyad<br/>&gt;&gt; third and a triad third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; dyad third? excuse me, there was no dyad in any of the listening<br/>&gt; experiments.</p><p>No, but there are dyad thirds in Bob&apos;s analysis of what&apos;s happening here.<br/>Again, his discussion of double stops.

And, if so, his conclusion appears<br/>to be quite intent on denying the &quot;reality&quot; of the psychoacoustic effect<br/>some of us have experienced here. Or at minimum, his mysterious &quot;liberation&quot;<br/>from it. The business of &quot;na&iuml;ve&quot; ears being fooled is pure BS. The<br/>professional singers I have worked with for decades do not have na&iuml;ve ears,<br/>yet they do tend to sing the &quot;same&quot; high third I do. The question is *why*--<br/>not *if*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; I have long been convinced for example that the famous curves<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; relating frequency and pitch using naive listeners are not<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; representative of highly musical ears highly experienced with precise<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; tuning. The correlation of pitch with frequency is rather skewed,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; with the naive ear hearing very sharp pitches in the higher ranges as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; in tune and what I would call clean pitches as flat. I have run into<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; this with amateur sopranos in their high range and it usually takes<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; quite some doing to get them over this.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Don&apos;t confuse ordinary out-of-tune sopranos with illusionary *relative*<br/>&gt;&gt; pitch perceptions. Such poor intonation would likely not result from seeking<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic consonance with other singers. In my experience, those sharp<br/>&gt;&gt; sopranos are not listening to much other than their own voices. (Probably<br/>&gt;&gt; singing pitches &quot;learned&quot; from listening to the piano.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; bob is referring to the well-known psychoacoustical phenomenon in<br/>&gt; which, especially given a sine-wave timbre, subjects invariably<br/>&gt; choose melodic octaves slightly *wider* than 2:1 as &quot;correct&quot;.</p><p>I am aware of this phenomenon and have seen it mentioned here from time to<br/>time. However, sopranos don&apos;t sing with sine tones. Also, the small amount<br/>of octave stretching in the phenomenon would not likely be problematic in<br/>practical vocal music. Should the singer actually &quot;hear&quot; it, the audience<br/>will likely hear it too and accept it. Let&apos;s be real, folks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; This learning experience has taught me that the ear learns to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; correlate frequency and pitch in an increasingly objective way. I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore feel that those with poor intonation sense have simply<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; not &quot;objectified&quot; their ears in this way and thus easily fall prey to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; whatever psychoacoustic anomolies might assail them.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t know what you are saying here, Bob. My ear (which I&apos;m quite sure is<br/>&gt;&gt; not a &quot;na&iuml;ve&quot; one) cannot *hear* frequency. (It can&apos;t even count to ten.) My<br/>&gt;&gt; ear also cannot *hear* pitch out of tonal context, in the sense of naming it<br/>&gt;&gt; Eb or F#. So what do you mean by the phrase &quot;correlate frequency and pitch&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; he means, for example, hearing 2:1 melodic octaves as &quot;in tune&quot;<br/>&gt; (though i question whether even bob could do this with sine waves in<br/>&gt; an extreme register).</p><p>You still haven&apos;t answered my question. How does one &quot;correlate frequency<br/>and pitch&quot;? What significance do these words have in regard to hearing<br/>octaves in tune?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; There are without any doubt, as I see it, psychoacoustic phenomena<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; that predispose naive ears towards perceptions that do not support<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; miminum tuning dissonance in the context of harmony, i.e., JI<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; harmony.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; And what might those be?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; geez, i thought i gave an goodly number of examples of these types of<br/>&gt; psychoacoustical phenomena already -- several weeks ago if i remember<br/>&gt; correctly.</p><p>I don&apos;t remember you relating any of them to &quot;na&iuml;ve ears.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet the tuning dissonances that arise in sufficiently non-JI<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; harmonies do not go away simply because some of these phenomena<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; predispose the ear away from JI.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Did anyone here say that dissonance goes away because of psychoacoustic<br/>&gt;&gt; phenomena?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; no. bob is just completing the logic in his argument, not suggesting<br/>&gt; that anyone said this in particular.</p><p>Oh? Do you really believe that? His whole discourse appears directed toward<br/>dismissing the the &quot;learned&quot; high third. I would welcome that opinion if his<br/>supporting ideas related to the real issues here. Unfortunately, his<br/>discussion simply shows that he doesn&apos;t really &quot;get it.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Bob, I appreciate your time and effort here but this makes little sense to<br/>&gt;&gt; me. You clearly believe &quot;something&quot; but what it is doesn&apos;t strike any<br/>&gt;&gt; familiar chords in my musical experience.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i have the exact opposite reaction. bob, in fact, has struck so many<br/>&gt; familiar chords in my musical experience since joining this list last<br/>&gt; year, that &apos;meeting&apos; him will be an experience i&apos;ll never forget. but<br/>&gt; that&apos;s besides the point -- again, i&apos;m not trying to side with him<br/>&gt; against you or anything like that -- my motto here is &quot;jus&apos; da facts,<br/>&gt; man&quot;.</p><p>I know that is your intention, Paul. And it&apos;s a laudable one. And of course<br/>one tends to bond with someone who seems to be expressing ideas and<br/>experiences that resonate with one&apos;s own point of view.</p><p>However, your attempt at &quot;clarification&quot; here is little more than a weak<br/>defense. You, as has Bob, simply apply your *theory* without regard for<br/>practical experience. (Sine waves and sopranos--give me a break!)</p><p>Just before the Yahoo fiasco, Bob posted a &quot;position paper&quot; to which I<br/>responded in regard to strange assumptions and even stranger conclusions. He<br/>didn&apos;t respond to my comments, so I chalked it up to his busy schedule. Your<br/>response to his &quot;position paper&quot; was a hearty pat on the back and a comment<br/>that you couldn&apos;t have written it better.

Otherwise you would not have spent so much time<br/>helping us explore it.

With all due respect, these conclusions<br/>&gt; about what I&apos;m saying baffle me as much as the theory we&apos;re trying to<br/>&gt; evaluate does.

Much of what I have been concerned about in your early posts was<br/>largely ignored by both you and Paul. (My responses to your &quot;position<br/>paper,&quot; for example, that Paul said he agreed with so heartily that he might<br/>well have written it himself.)</p><p>It&apos;s pretty clear that you are &quot;baffled&quot; by all of this. My impression has<br/>been that you kind of float over this discussion relying on a cursory<br/>reading of the content and then assume that your old comfortable concepts<br/>are adequate for the job. I realize that you have been busy, but when you<br/>fail to &quot;get it&quot; you risk &quot;sticks and stones&quot; from people like me. :-)</p><p>By the way, I&apos;m not &quot;putting words&quot; into your mouth, Bob. I&apos;m taking your<br/>total report and reflecting on what I hear (see). I realized (even while<br/>doing so) that you would probably would not like what I see. My &quot;mirror&quot; is<br/>offered in honesty. Take it or leave it.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Paul to me:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; it&apos;s only your<br/>&gt;&gt; interpretation that he experienced the illusionary high third.<br/>&gt;&gt; nothing he said suggests that he *necessarily* did.</p><p>&gt; [Right again! I only noticed the well-documented drop in subjective<br/>&gt; pitch when the root and fifth drop out. If you want to use that<br/>&gt; subjectively lowered pitch as the reference and designate as higher<br/>&gt; the previous pitch perception of the same frequency in the context of<br/>&gt; the just triad (yes, *FREQUENCY*, since that is the objective<br/>&gt; reference used for JI), then fine! I have no objection to that. Just<br/>&gt; don&apos;t call it a &quot;high third&quot;, since it is simply a JI 4:5 third in<br/>&gt; context with the triad and is only subjectively higher in pitch (for<br/>&gt; some) than the stand-alone third.]</p><p>I think we may have a winner here, Bob. We all *know* (thanks to Paul&apos;s<br/>jerry0) that the third sounding in the JI triad is &quot;simply a JI 4:5 third.&quot;<br/>And you are correct that the high third &quot;some&quot; of us hear in that context is<br/>&quot;only subjectively higher in pitch.&quot; That&apos;s an important part of the puzzle<br/>that we only recently discovered.</p><p>However, I also realize (at least, I believe so) that singers and string<br/>players frequently perform an *actual* high third that approximates the<br/>illusionary one. There is little disagreement about that. Call it personal<br/>preference, artistic deviation, or whatever. It does exist.</p><p>The questions then are these: (1) have &quot;flexible pitch&quot; performers learned<br/>the high third from having &quot;imagined&quot; it while singing and playing JI<br/>triads, and if so, (2) do they then tend to *actually* perform it as a<br/>result of having learned it from the JI triad?</p><p>-----------</p><p>Me:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Hold on, Bob. When you first heard jerry00, you described the third in the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; triad as the &quot;right&quot; third and the naked third as flat.</p><p>Paul:</p><p>&gt;&gt; that&apos;s not quite right. he said the pitch of the note that was the<br/>&gt;&gt; third in the triad went down after its harmonic context had been<br/>&gt;&gt; removed. sure, one possible interpretation of that is in terms of<br/>&gt;&gt; your current &apos;illusionary high third&apos; theory. another interpretation<br/>&gt;&gt; i gave in terms of known psychoacoustical phenomena. BUT, NB: he<br/>&gt;&gt; *still* hears the thirds of jerry01, jerry02, etc. though jerry07 go<br/>&gt;&gt; down after *their* triadic contexts are removed. these are not just<br/>&gt;&gt; thirds -- far from it. so how would your current theory account for<br/>&gt;&gt; that?</p><p>&gt; [Right again, Paul! You seems to understand me clearly. Wish<br/>&gt; everybody did.]</p><p>I, too, can hear a change in the naked third in the other jerries when the<br/>root/fifth drops out. If that change is in pitch, it seems to me not nearly<br/>as pronounced as it is in jerry00. Again, I must (in order to be true to my<br/>own sense of reality) read your reported perceptions in relation to my own.<br/>That&apos;s just the way it is.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Evidently, it hadn&apos;t<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; occurred to you before that there even *was* a difference between a dyad<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; third and a triad third.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>Paul:</p><p>&gt;&gt; dyad third? excuse me, there was no dyad in any of the listening<br/>&gt;&gt; experiments.</p><p>&gt; [True. There weren&apos;t, and I was deliberately remaining ignorant of<br/>&gt; the previous discussions until after I hear the &quot;Jerries&quot;, so I<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t even know what I was supposed to be listening for. I just<br/>&gt; described in detail what I perceived and my reactions to that. Any<br/>&gt; comments from me about dyads came in later follow-up discussions.]</p><p>No problem with unprejudiced hearing and your subsequent initial report. My<br/>&quot;problem&quot; arose when you changed your report upon finding out what you were<br/>&quot;supposed to be listening for.&quot; Your irrelevant (in my opinion)<br/>justification in terms of your dealing with 4:5 thirds simply demonstrated<br/>that you &quot;didn&apos;t get it.&quot;</p><p>--------------------</p><p>Bob said:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, from extensive personal experience with highly precise<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tuning both of instruments like the piano, synthesizers, and dynamic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tuning of violin and voice, I had learned that the ear tends<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to &quot;objectify&quot; its perceptions over time to accord more precisely<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the measurable parameters such as frequency. I had expressed<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this point of view clearly at the outset in my responses to this<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thread.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>I said:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Don&apos;t confuse ordinary out-of-tune sopranos with illusionary *relative*<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; pitch perceptions. Such poor intonation would likely not result from seeking<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; harmonic consonance with other singers. In my experience, those sharp<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; sopranos are not listening to much other than their own voices. (Probably<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; singing pitches &quot;learned&quot; from listening to the piano.)</p><p>&gt; [I have exstensive experience, Jerry, with very inexperienced amateur<br/>&gt; (and some experienced professional) singers who have what I call<br/>&gt; a &quot;pitch bias&quot; or &quot;perpetual pitch offset&quot;. It is flat for most<br/>&gt; voices. I jokingly refer to what I call the &quot;saddly sagging tenor<br/>&gt; syndrome&quot;. It&apos;s almost universal in the states and to some degree in<br/>&gt; Europe. You find it even in well-known professional choral ensembles.</p><p>I find it more likely due to poor vocal production than to poor tuning. When<br/>the vocal production is improved (usually by raising the resonance &quot;window&quot;)<br/>tuning usually fixes itself.</p><p>&gt; Very rarely do you find such a perpetual bias to the sharp side<br/>&gt; except in sopranos.</p><p>Generally true (although I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s a &quot;perceptual&quot; bias).<br/>Occasionally, an Irish tenor type will float off into the stratosphere, but<br/>frequently that can be chalked up to ego. And then there is the singer who<br/>floats both ways, likely due to never having focused on being &quot;in tune&quot; (as<br/>opposed to matching &quot;mushy&quot; piano pitches).</p><p>Another possibility might have to do with the soprano voice being always<br/>(when in high register) in &quot;head tone.&quot; They can only get there by &quot;dropping<br/>off&quot; the weight of low resonance. That might induce a kind of &quot;floating.&quot;</p><p>&gt; Sure, other voices and even more experienced<br/>&gt; sopranos can temporarily &quot;overheat&quot; on a crescendo and drive the<br/>&gt; pitch sharp, especially if they&apos;re not attentive to pitch enough to<br/>&gt; invoke the intuitive physical adjustments needed to compensate a<br/>&gt; crescendo and maintain a constant pitch despite it.</p><p>It frequently happens even without a crescendo, and that&apos;s even more<br/>excruciating.</p><p>&gt; However, it is<br/>&gt; not at all rare to find sopranos with a perpetual sharp offset. I<br/>&gt; believe that this discrepancy among voice parts is likely due to the<br/>&gt; pitch/frequency correlations documented in the experiments using<br/>&gt; relatively untrained subjects. None of the other voices overlap much<br/>&gt; of the range where this sharp bias shows up in these curves.]</p><p>I still have not been informed as to the meaning of &quot;pitch/frequency<br/>correlations.&quot; Also, what does it have to do with the present discussion?<br/>Since the &quot;sharp bias&quot; shows up in untrained subjects, I fail to see what it<br/>has to do with highly trained and experienced singers hearing and performing<br/>the high third.</p><p>&gt;&gt; bob is referring to the well-known psychoacoustical phenomenon in<br/>&gt;&gt; which, especially given a sine-wave timbre, subjects invariably<br/>&gt;&gt; choose melodic octaves slightly *wider* than 2:1 as &quot;correct&quot;.</p><p>&gt; [Yes again. This research was cited by Paul in the<br/>&gt; discussions following the Jerries examples, and the apparent total<br/>&gt; lack of any conceptual linkage to that in this response baffles me<br/>&gt; once again. If we have to re-establish context every time we respond,<br/>&gt; this is going to be a hopeless little, or maybe big, journey.]</p><p>This is the kind of verbiage that drives me to frustration. Again, what do<br/>sopranos have to do with sine-wave experiments? Either make the connection<br/>or drop it. If you think there is a &quot;conceptual linkage,&quot; please describe<br/>it. Concerning re-establishing context, I&apos;m not sure you and I have yet<br/>established a mutual context. Whether we do will largely depend on our<br/>continuing clarifications.</p><p>-----------------<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>Bob:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This learning experience has taught me that the ear learns to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlate frequency and pitch in an increasingly objective way. I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore feel that those with poor intonation sense have simply<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not &quot;objectified&quot; their ears in this way and thus easily fall prey to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whatever psychoacoustic anomolies might assail them.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Me:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t know what you are saying here, Bob. My ear (which I&apos;m quite sure is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; not a &quot;na&iuml;ve&quot; one) cannot *hear* frequency. (It can&apos;t even count to ten.) My<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ear also cannot *hear* pitch out of tonal context, in the sense of naming it<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Eb or F#. So what do you mean by the phrase &quot;correlate frequency and pitch&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; he means, for example, hearing 2:1 melodic octaves as &quot;in tune&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; (though i question whether even bob could do this with sine waves in<br/>&gt;&gt; an extreme register).</p><p>&gt; [Right, Paul. Again, all reference to the cited research seems to<br/>&gt; have been lost here. The closest objective correlate to pitch that<br/>&gt; any of us know about is frequency. The whole Jerries experiment would<br/>&gt; be meaningless without the experimental controls in terms of<br/>&gt; frequency, so why are we trying to throw it out here?]</p><p>No one is trying to throw out frequency. My comment above had to do with the<br/>fact that you said &quot;the ear learns to correlate frequency and pitch in an<br/>increasingly objective way.&quot; What does that mean? After you clarify that, we<br/>can talk about keeping it (with *your* meaning) or throwing it out. :-)</p><p>------------</p><p>Bob:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are without any doubt, as I see it, psychoacoustic phenomena<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that predispose naive ears towards perceptions that do not support<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; miminum tuning dissonance in the context of harmony, i.e., JI<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; harmony.</p><p>Me:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; And what might those be?</p><p>Paul:</p><p>&gt;&gt; geez, i thought i gave an goodly number of examples of these types of<br/>&gt;&gt; psychoacoustical phenomena already -- several weeks ago if i remember<br/>&gt;&gt; correctly.</p><p>(My response to Paul is omitted here. Bob doesn&apos;t comment on it [so what&apos;s<br/>new?] so I guess he thought it was reasonable.)</p><p>&gt; [Is the psychoacoustic phenomenon we&apos;re discussing, namely the<br/>&gt; subjective pitch difference in a tone of constant *FREQUENCY* with a<br/>&gt; change in context, not a case in point!!!!???? ...Is not this<br/>&gt; whole &quot;high third&quot; theory based on the idea that this phenomenon<br/>&gt; conditions some people&apos;s ears to re-inject into a triad a third that<br/>&gt; is higher to a just third than even 12-EDO thirds? Is that not a<br/>&gt; psychoacoustic phenomenon that by your own explicit agreement in a<br/>&gt; previous post predisposes the ear away from JI, Jerry? How did we<br/>&gt; get this lost? I was not being in the least abstract here, but rather<br/>&gt; referring directly to the phenomenon under discussion!]</p><p>Actually, pretty close, Bob. I suspect that our miscommunication lies more<br/>with your apparent attempt to camouflage your sudden change of perception<br/>than with the actual issues here.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I&apos;d use the term &quot;re-inject&quot; but I think I know what you mean.<br/>I also think I know what you *think* you mean when you say you have<br/>&quot;overcome&quot; the illusion; however, you haven&apos;t responded to my suspicion that<br/>you simply have *chosen* to ignore the high-third effect. That might be a<br/>good thing to do next, don&apos;t you think? I have a hard time believing that<br/>you &quot;forgot&quot; how to focus on the high third having done it before.</p><p>------------------</p><p>Bob said:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet the tuning dissonances that arise in sufficiently non-JI<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; harmonies do not go away simply because some of these phenomena<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; predispose the ear away from JI.</p><p>Me:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Did anyone here say that dissonance goes away because of psychoacoustic<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; phenomena?</p><p>Paul:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; no. bob is just completing the logic in his argument, not suggesting<br/>&gt;&gt; that anyone said this in particular.</p><p>&gt; [Well, I&apos;m not sure I confine myself to that, Paul. It is true that I<br/>&gt; am just completing the logic of my argument here, and meant nothing<br/>&gt; behond that. Jerry has clearly stated, and reconfirmed my summary to<br/>&gt; this effect, that his reinjected, literally supra-ET high third<br/>&gt; sounds &quot;in tune&quot; to his ear. To me that implies that this deceptive<br/>&gt; pitch illusion we&apos;re dealing with somehow generates for some<br/>&gt; musicians&apos; ears a new pitch that is &quot;away from JI&quot;,...one that he<br/>&gt; feels sounds &quot;in tune&quot;, whatever that could possibly mean in this<br/>&gt; context. If &quot;in tune&quot; means &quot;no tuning dissonance&quot; or even &quot;reduced<br/>&gt; tuning dissonance&quot;, then he has clearly implied that somehow the<br/>&gt; tuning dissonance of his literally high third has been ameliorated by<br/>&gt; a psychoacoustic phenomenon that predisposes the ear away from JI.]</p><p>Actually, not bad, Bob. You apparently have the basics pretty well in hand.<br/>In fact, your choice of terms throws a kind of fresh glow on the subject.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob, I appreciate your time and effort here but this makes little sense to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; me. You clearly believe &quot;something&quot; but what it is doesn&apos;t strike any<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; familiar chords in my musical experience.</p><p>&gt; [Well, again with all due respect, Jerry, I think I have probably<br/>&gt; made it abundantly clear that your musical experiences, at least as<br/>&gt; described in the current discussion, are at least as completely alien<br/>&gt; to me. So I would be surprised if my experiences mapped nicely into<br/>&gt; yours. I don&apos;t think that we can can reasonably expect one to map<br/>&gt; into the other without it being mutual.]</p><p>My sentiments precisely. In that regard, I sense that a &quot;straight ahead&quot;<br/>exchange (as in this post) will help us blow away the distractions and focus<br/>on the helpful. Paul has my full blessing in &quot;siding with&quot; you. We are not<br/>competing for bragging rights here. We&apos;re trying to understand and describe<br/>a phenomenon that is commonly experienced.</p><p>As we proceed, I suggest that we (and others) try to minimize dogmatic<br/>claims about the implications of this or that &quot;study&quot; without solid<br/>experience or evidence that it applies here. I think that will help.</p><p>------------</p><p>Paul said:</p><p>&gt;&gt; i have the exact opposite reaction. bob, in fact, has struck so many<br/>&gt;&gt; familiar chords in my musical experience since joining this list last<br/>&gt;&gt; year, that &apos;meeting&apos; him will be an experience i&apos;ll never forget. but<br/>&gt;&gt; that&apos;s besides the point -- again, i&apos;m not trying to side with him<br/>&gt;&gt; against you or anything like that -- my motto here is &quot;jus&apos; da facts,<br/>&gt;&gt; man&quot;.</p><p>Bob said:</p><p>&gt; [Well, I don&apos;t think human feelings should be beside the point here.<br/>&gt; It is not my intention to hurt anyone&apos;s feelings, and hope I haven&apos;t.</p><p>You haven&apos;t.</p><p>&gt; Paul and I have certainly had our scraps here, as anyone who has been<br/>&gt; here for awhile or looked thoroughly through the archives must know.<br/>&gt; However, Paul&apos;s challenges to my thinking have deepened my<br/>&gt; understanding very substantially. I hope this is true for Jerry, too.</p><p>It is, and I have said so many times.</p><p>&gt; I respect Paul as extremely erudite, a professional blues guitarist<br/>&gt; (I love it!) and practicing microtonalist (witness his guitar<br/>&gt; collection), and mathematician, who is also incredibly well-versed in<br/>&gt; tuning history and stylistic evolution from medieval times and even<br/>&gt; much earlier. I love that we can discuss jazz, blues, &quot;classical&quot;,<br/>&gt; middle eastern, and other ethnic music with him and he&apos;s right on top<br/>&gt; of it. Fantastic! I have utmost respect for you, Paul, and your words<br/>&gt; really warm my heart.]</p><p>Paul, please stand for heart-felt round of applause! :-)</p><p>----------------</p><p>I said:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; By the way, now that you have disposed of &quot;na&iuml;ve&quot; ears, does that mean you<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; don&apos;t intend to do the &quot;experiment&quot; with your choir?</p><p>&gt; [Please do not take my phrase &quot;naive ears&quot; out of the context in<br/>&gt; which it was used, namely the psychoacoustic experiments correlating<br/>&gt; pitch and frequency that Paul recognized as my reference above. I did<br/>&gt; refer to them as &quot;the famous pitch/frequency correlation curves&quot; or<br/>&gt; something like that. The subjects in those experiments were not<br/>&gt; experts in tuning anything. I am not so up on these things that I<br/>&gt; remember specific references, and am therefore unable to document<br/>&gt; things as if I were writing a thesis.]</p><p>Fair enough. In that case, perhaps such references are better left out.<br/>Agree?</p><p>-------------------------</p><p>Paul said to me:</p><p>&gt;&gt; i think jerry10.wav is the best<br/>&gt;&gt; test of it yet. unfortunately, you and i are the only people who have<br/>&gt;&gt; listened to it. come on, folks! is *anyone* out there?<br/>&gt;<br/>Bob said:</p><p>&gt; [I will listen soon. I have no idea what it contains other than<br/>&gt; something along the lines of the previous Jerries with some new<br/>&gt; variation that I don&apos;t want to know about beforehand. I will just<br/>&gt; listen and give a detailed report on what I heard.</p><p>No doubling back this time. Okay?</p><p>&gt; I will also try<br/>&gt; the experiment with the choir, but there will be an inevitable delay<br/>&gt; in that. We just finished a very successful performance for the local<br/>&gt; community concert association. (We love getting substantial revenues<br/>&gt; when they had all the expenses and the work for promotion, etc.) We<br/>&gt; have a recording session Tuesday and then the choir gets a well-<br/>&gt; deserved vacation for awhile. I don&apos;t want to burn them out. That<br/>&gt; leaves no opportunities for anything non-essential until we<br/>&gt; reconvene.]<br/>&gt;<br/>Thanks, Bob. Now that I&apos;m sure you understand the &quot;experiment&quot; your feedback<br/>on this will be helpful.</p><p>By the way, at Paul&apos;s prompting, I dug out a recording of the &quot;experiment&quot;<br/>that I posted last time. As you will see, it only takes a few seconds. If<br/>you can work it into your warm-up tomorrow it would be terrific. I suggest<br/>that you not tell the singers what you are listening for. Just tell them to<br/>seek the &quot;best&quot; tuning and to ignore the piano&apos;s &quot;comparison&quot; pitch.</p><p>Also, I ran across five mp3s that demonstrate what I have been talking about<br/>here. I had forgotten about them. Perhaps they will help us determine what<br/>this thing is all about.</p><p>You can find all of these items at:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://stage3music.com/soundpage.html">http://stage3music.com/soundpage.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Or:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://www.stage3music.com/soundpage.html">http://www.stage3music.com/soundpage.html</a>&gt;</p><p>Bob, I have a good feeling about your responses here. I think we have begun<br/>to follow the &quot;credo&quot; I described in an earlier post about persistent<br/>communication until both parties feel they understand what the other is<br/>saying. I hope this is not making you horny, however. :-) (You have to have<br/>seen my earlier post in order to &quot;get&quot; that.

I am not so up on these things that I<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; remember specific references, and am therefore unable to document<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; things as if I were writing a thesis.]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Fair enough. In that case, perhaps such references are better left out.<br/>&gt;&gt; Agree?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; i certainly hope that we can rest upon well-documented<br/>&gt; psychoacoustical phenomena and not have to discover them all<br/>&gt; &quot;from scratch&quot;! i supplied some specific references -- let me<br/>&gt; know what else i can do.<br/>&gt;<br/>Simply be reasonably sure that any well-documented phenomena quoted actually<br/>applies (or likely may apply) to an issues under discussion; and when it<br/>does, make every effort to show *how* it applies. Sometimes I get the<br/>impression that you sometimes toss &quot;studies&quot; into the arena simply to squash<br/>someone&apos;s expressed idea and put an end to their point.</p><p>Incidentally, I took Bob&apos;s paragraph (above) to mean that he had some<br/>reservations in that regard and was being honest in &quot;withdrawing&quot; the<br/>reference. Now *that* engenders respect.</p><p>Again, Paul, thanks for tossing your &quot;questions&quot; into the discussion.

It refers to that and nothing more. You also did this<br/>with &quot;naive&quot; when I used it to refer to experimental subjects in a<br/>well-known study of pitch/frequency correlation.</p><p>I ask that you please read with context in mind and refrain from<br/>automatically applying to yourself adjectives you find disagreeable,<br/>without any  thought to their actual targets, just because I<br/>challenge your position. I also beg you to refrain from subtle and<br/>prejudicial polemics in our threads such as the reference to my use<br/>of &quot;amusing&quot;. If you felt insulted by my honest depiction of my<br/>perceptions, then I feel that discourages the clear, honest statement<br/>of opinions, something you have said you value.</p><p>If your ideas have real merit, then it is unnecessary to resort to<br/>any tactics aimed at discrediting challenges to them. Instead I<br/>suggest using clear reasoning. I have responded to your position by<br/>stating my understanding of it for you succinctly in easy-to-<br/>understand steps, and as requested, you confirmed with no<br/>reservations whatsoever that my understanding was indeed accurate.</p><p>So far you have failed to respond in kind. I have only received<br/>responses characterized by defensive distortions of my positions. No<br/>description of yours relating to my position has come close to<br/>anything I could confirm as accurate.</p><p>Paul understands my position so well he was actually able to very<br/>effectively answer as if he were I in responding to one of your posts<br/>step by step. He did an accurate, absolutely stellar job. I couldn&apos;t<br/>have done it better myself. You, on the other hand, even with<br/>plentiful corrective input from both Paul and me, have consistently<br/>distorted my position, with all kinds of projections concerning my<br/>motives and supposed desire to coerce you and others into my way of<br/>thinking. So far, the more we try to correct you understading of my<br/>position, the more entangled it gets...endlessly.</p><p>I have clearly stated your position, which in spite of my clarity<br/>concerning what it is, frankly makes no sense to me. I ask you to<br/>make a similarly honest and forthright attempt to understand my<br/>postion; not to agreee with it, but to simply demonstrate to me that<br/>you understand it clearly. If you attempt this till you get it right,<br/>I will confirm its accuracy for you.</p><p>Only after you&apos;ve done this can we have a reliable platform from<br/>which to conduct further communications. I ask that any such further<br/>communications be free of accusations of alledged ulterior motives<br/>and that you accept my statements concerning my perceptions at face<br/>value wihtout questioning my integrity in describing them. You don&apos;t<br/>have to agree with them, but only accept them as my honestly<br/>described perceptions.</p><p>I also ask that if you&apos;re not capable of responding without logical<br/>flaws in your conclusions and responses regarding either your<br/>perceptions or our communications with each other, that you at least<br/>remain open to corrections to those flaws when we point them out,<br/>rather than simply resorting to disparaging polemics and doubts<br/>concerning the integrity of our motives.</p><p>Please respond step by step with clear, well-reasoned statements and<br/>questions. This will provide a simple format that allows quick, well-<br/>placed responses that correct any misperceptions and logical flaws<br/>without getting buried in unproductive rhetoric.</p><p>These are the only conditions under which I agree to spend my<br/>precious time in further discussion in this particular thread. Thank<br/>you in advance for your cooperation, Jerry.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Bob</p></div>
