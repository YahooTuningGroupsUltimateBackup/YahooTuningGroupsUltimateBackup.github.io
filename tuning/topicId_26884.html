This tradition is<br/>also carried forward by a participant on this List with a very special<br/>perspective: Manuel Op de Coul, author of the Scala scale definition<br/>and analysis program most generously made available via the Internet<br/>to interested lovers of music throughout the world.</p><p>Here, combining two systems described by the most sage and intrepid<br/>Vicentino in 1555, I would like to show how the expressive power of<br/>enharmonic or fifthtone music may be united to the beauties of purely<br/>intoned concords.</p><p>The result at which I have arrived is a gamut of 62 notes per octave,<br/>uniting two 31-note cycles of pure major thirds and tempered fifths,<br/>often known as 1/4-comma meantone. If these two cycles are placed at<br/>the distance of 1/4 syntonic comma, the amount by which the fifths<br/>within each cycle are tempered or &quot;foreshortened,&quot; then we may<br/>combine notes from the two cycles so as to achieve the pure concords<br/>which Vicentino so extols.[1] [2]</p><p>Since it may be not unfitting that the first examples of a possibly<br/>new thing should be small and modest, so that others, in the noble<br/>words of Johann Walther, may be encouraged to do better, I present a<br/>small piece taking its notes from this 62-tone gamut, _Invocatio in<br/>Quarto Tono_. As explained below, I have taken the liberty of using<br/>tempered sonorities in a few places to avoid certain complications[3]:</p><p>MIDI: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Also, here is a Scala file of the complete 62-tone system with its two<br/>31-note cycles:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/qcm62a.scl">http://value.net/~mschulter/qcm62a.scl</a>&gt;</p><p>With due circumspection, I should caution that I do not know whether<br/>or how many times over the last 450 years or so people may have<br/>proposed or devised such a gamut of 62 tones; let this description be<br/>a tribute to all, known or unknown, who may have discovered it<br/>before.</p><p>Further, since such a system (whether new or old) should serve as an<br/>invitation to much musical invention, I would propose an experiment<br/>I have not yet attempted myself: to see what kind of art and ingenuity<br/>might be expressed in a composition using all 62 notes of the gamut.</p><p>In what follows, first placing this system in a more just historical<br/>perspective while honoring one who has fostered our craft, I shall<br/>explain the nature of the tuning and of the example I have chosen to<br/>illustrate it.</p><p>----------------------------------<br/>1. Dedication to Manuel Op de Coul<br/>----------------------------------</p><p>Just 500 years ago, in 1501, Ottavio Petrucci published the anthology<br/>of music entitled _Odhecaton_, thus inaugurating a new and high<br/>technology making this art more accessible to a larger public.</p><p>Only 54 years later, in 1555, Nicola Vicentino used this same<br/>technology to publish his _Ancient Music Adapted to Modern Practice_,<br/>exhibiting by precept and example his visionary xenharmonic art, and<br/>describing his _archicembalo_ or superharpsichord used in making its<br/>steps and ratios a sonorous reality.</p><p>While Vicentino took as the foundation for his basic 31-note cycle the<br/>common practice of &quot;good tuners,&quot; likely meaning in this connection a<br/>temperament with pure major thirds, in the latter part of the<br/>following century your illustrious compatriot Christiaan Huygens,<br/>scientist and learned arbiter of beauty, proposed a &quot;New Harmonic<br/>Cycle&quot; dividing the octave into 31 precisely equal parts.</p><p>Moving forward about 250 years to one of the most terrible times in<br/>the history of Europe, we find the physicist and friend of humanity<br/>Adriaan Fokker engaged in research which will not aid the National<br/>Socialist occupiers of the Netherlands and many other countries: the<br/>development of new systems of music based on purer concords.</p><p>This musical quest makes Fokker a leading theorist and advocate of two<br/>great systems: just intonation, and the 31-tone cycle introduced by<br/>Vicentino and presented in its ideally symmetrical form by Huygens.<br/>The recent Netherlands traditions of 31-tone organs and ensemble music<br/>translating this theory into practice stands as a monument to Fokker&apos;s<br/>genius and most eloquent advocacy.</p><p>Like Petrucci, you have used a new technology to a high musical<br/>purpose: as the author of Scala, you have provided an invaluable tool<br/>by which we may not only search out, define, and share tunings, but<br/>indeed may publish new compositions as well as reinterpret old ones by<br/>specifying not only the notes but the desired intonation.</p><p>In past months and years, I have celebrated in words Vicentino&apos;s<br/>system for pure intonation, but with the reservation that it can only<br/>partially and somewhat awkwardly be realized on a conventional<br/>keyboard instrument which a player must negotiate in real time.</p><p>With the benefit of Scala, however, it is quite easy to implement this<br/>system for old or new compositions, and indeed to combine it with<br/>Vicentino&apos;s other tuning based on a 31-note meantone cycle, enjoying<br/>the wonders of enharmonic progressions and of pure concords alike.</p><p>Further, as if at once to make Vicentino&apos;s music better known and to<br/>show the variety of intonational choices open in performances of this<br/>music, you have yourself admirably arranged a portion of his madrigal<br/>_Madonna il poco dolce_ using Wuerschmidt&apos;s 31-note scale based on a<br/>classic 5-limit system, reminding us of the contributions of Adriaan<br/>Fokker to the art of integer-based just intonation.[4]</p><p>By such gifts, reflecting a most august musical tradition and opening<br/>the way to so many musical possibilities in a new century, you have<br/>enriched our xenharmonic community in a way we may celebrate through<br/>words and notes alike.</p><p>--------------------------------------------<br/>2. A dual harmonic cycle: the 62-note system<br/>--------------------------------------------</p><p>As explained above, the 62-note system simply combines two 31-note<br/>cycles in 1/4-comma meantone at the distance of 1/4 syntonic comma, a<br/>distance of about 5.38 cents (this comma, at 81:80, having a size of<br/>around 21.51 cents).</p><p>It is a fascinating if moot question of history whether Vicentino<br/>himself might have favored and implemented this full 62-note system if<br/>he had been able to build such a large instrument, and find a player<br/>(or mechanism?) capable of realizing its musical potential.</p><p>His actual designs were limited to 38 notes per octave, with two<br/>19-note manuals, and his practical instruments to 36 notes, since he<br/>could fit only 17 of the desired 19 notes on his second manual,<br/>omitting the keys corresponding to the E# and B# found on his lower or<br/>regular manual.</p><p>In considering his two tuning systems, however, we may find it helpful<br/>to consider his full 38-note gamut.</p><p>The first system includes 31 notes forming a complete meantone<br/>system, likely in a 1/4-comma temperament with pure major thirds,<br/>although 31-note equal temperament (31-tET) would result from a<br/>precise implementation of his concept that each whole-tone is divided<br/>into five &quot;minor dieses&quot; or fifthtones, if we take these steps to be<br/>equal. This leaves seven notes on the instrument free for another<br/>purpose.</p><p>Vicentino uses them as &quot;comma&quot; keys, tuned a &quot;comma&quot; higher than their<br/>usual diatonic counterparts on the lower manual (F-B) so as to aid or<br/>perfect certain concords. While the term &quot;comma&quot; as used by Vicentino<br/>can mean various small intervals, here it is tempting to read it in<br/>its meaning as the amount by which the fifth is tempered, 1/4 syntonic<br/>comma if we assume pure major thirds at 5:4.</p><p>Here is a keyboard diagram for this interpretation of the first<br/>tuning, showing the two manuals and six &quot;ranks&quot; of the instrument,<br/>with an asterisk (*) showing a note raised by a diesis or fifthtone,<br/>typically 128:125 (~41.06 cents) in my version of the gamut, and an<br/>apostrophe (&apos;) showing a note raised by a syntonic comma. Vicentino&apos;s<br/>36-note implementations do not include C&apos; and F&apos;:</p><p>Rank 6:  C&apos;    D&apos;    E&apos;  F&apos;      G&apos;    A&apos;   B&apos;<br/>Rank 5:     Db*   Eb*       Gb*   Ab*   Bb*<br/>Rank 4:  C*    D*    E*  F*    G*    A*    B*  C*     Manual 2<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Rank 3:    Db   D#    E#   Gb    Ab   A#    B#        Manual 1<br/>Rank 2:   C#     Eb       F#    G#     Bb<br/>Rank 1: C     D     E   F     G     A     B   C</p><p>In Vicentino&apos;s second tuning, the 19 notes of the lower manual are<br/>identical (Gb-B#), but instead of completing a 31-note fifthtone<br/>cycle, all the notes of the upper manual are tuned in &quot;just fifths&quot;<br/>with those of the lower manual (Db&apos;-F##&apos;). This produces a result<br/>_almost_ identical to that of the lower manual raised by 1/4-comma:<br/>instead of Gb&apos; (which would not be a pure fifth to any note on the<br/>lower manual), we get F##&apos; (forming the pure fifth B#-F##&apos;).[5]</p><p>Rank 6:    Db&apos; D#&apos;    E#    F##&apos; Ab&apos;  A#&apos;   B#&apos;<br/>Rank 5:   C#&apos;   Eb&apos;       F#&apos;   G#&apos;    Bb&apos;<br/>Rank 4: C&apos;    D&apos;    E&apos;  F&apos;    G&apos;    A&apos;    B&apos;  C&apos;     Manual 2<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Rank 3:    Db   D#    E#   Gb    Ab   A#    B#       Manual 1<br/>Rank 2:   C#     Eb       F#    G#     Bb<br/>Rank 1: C     D     E   F     G     A     B   C</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s first tuning offers a full 31-note meantone cycle for<br/>fifthtone music, plus what is now often known as &quot;adaptive just<br/>intonation&quot; for a few sonorities where the five or seven &quot;comma keys&quot;<br/>are available (if this is the correct interpretation of these keys).</p><p>His second tuning offers a basic 19-tone meantone subset of the full<br/>31-note cycle, over which comma keys are available to obtain justly<br/>intoned sonorities on every step, or almost every step (in the 36-note<br/>version without E#&apos; or B#&apos;).</p><p>We may take either of these tunings as the basis for a 62-note system<br/>providing a complete 31-note fifthtone cycle with just sonorities<br/>available on the great preponderance of steps -- 27 rather than all<br/>31, as we shall see, owing to the slightly asymmetrical nature of a<br/>31-note cycle based on pure major thirds.</p><p>Starting with the first tuning in its 38-note form, we have a complete<br/>31-tone cycle plus &quot;comma keys&quot; for seven of these notes; adding 24<br/>additional comma keys for the remaining notes of the cycle, we have<br/>a gamut of 62 notes in all.</p><p>Starting with the second 38-note tuning, we have 19 notes of the basic<br/>31-note cycle, plus comma keys for each of these notes: adding the<br/>remaining 12 notes to complete the basic cycle, plus the 12 comma keys<br/>for these notes, we again have 24 additional notes, or 62 in all.</p><p>We now come to a minor asymmetry of a 31-note cycle based on fifths<br/>tempered so that a chain of four (less two octaves) form a pure major<br/>third: 31 such fifths fall short of 18 pure octaves by about 6.07<br/>cents. Curiously, the 31st or &quot;odd&quot; fifth of the cycle is almost pure,<br/>6.07 cents larger than a regular fifth tempered by about 5.38 cents.</p><p>Major or minor thirds within each cycle having this near-pure fifth in<br/>their chains will be respectively 6.07 cents larger or narrower than<br/>their usual meantone sizes, so that even when notes from the two<br/>cycles are combined, sonorities on these steps will have tempered<br/>rather than pure concords. One might call this a kind of gentle<br/>&quot;well-temperament&quot; at a few remote places in the system.</p><p>Thus four major thirds in a 31-note cycle will have a size of around<br/>392.38 cents, wide by approximately 6.07 cents, while three minor<br/>thirds will be narrowed by this amount plus their usual tempering of<br/>1/4-comma, or about 11.45 cents, at a size of around 304.20 cents.</p><p>This curious asymmetry, which means that our 62-note system actually<br/>provides sonorities with pure fifths and pure thirds at 27 locations<br/>rather than 31 locations, might be considered not so much a flaw as an<br/>ornament somewhat imitating nature, which as Zarlino has remarked may<br/>tend toward variety rather than uniformity.</p><p>Thus the Earth, although often described as a sphere, in fact slightly<br/>varies from this ideal shape; and our harmonic cycle might also be<br/>said poetically to emulate the shifting phases of the Moon as seen<br/>from this planet.</p><p>However, this is by no means to deprecate the cycle of 31 equal steps<br/>as advocated by such illustrious champions as Huygens and Fokker,<br/>which might serve as the basis of a very similar 62-tone system.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>3. An enharmonic composition with pure concords<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>To demonstrate the 62-tone system based on pure major thirds in<br/>practice, I wlll provide a score of _Invocatio in Quarto Tono_, with<br/>an asterisk sign (*) raising a note by a diesis or fifthtone of<br/>128:125 (~41.06 cents), and an apostrophe or &quot;quartercomma&quot; sign (&apos;)<br/>raising it by 1/4-comma (~5.38 cents):</p><p>Here &quot;r&quot; shows a rest; a pause sign (,) in the line showing the rhythm<br/>(which might be taken as 2/2) indicates the conclusion of a phrase:</p><p>                                                                7<br/>   1    2   | 1    2   | 1   2  | 1   2  | 1    2  +  | 1   2  | 1   2 ,|<br/>   G#4        A4   A4    A4       A4       A4           A4       G#*4<br/>   E4         E&apos;4  E&apos;4   F4       E&apos;4           D4 C4   D4       E*4<br/>   B&apos;3        C&apos;4  C&apos;4   C&apos;4      C&apos;4      A3           A3       B*&apos;3<br/>   E3         A3   A3    F3       A3       F3           F3       E*3</p><p>   1    2  +   | 1     2    +   | 1   2  | 1   2  | 1    2  +  | 1   2  |<br/>   G#*4.

Also,<br/>one might deem the slight impurity of the sonority F3-A3-D4-A4 at<br/>measure 6, following the suspension, possibly to add a certain subtle<br/>impetus to the progression of major sixth to octave and major third to<br/>fifth, arriving at the pure concord of E*3-B*&apos;3-E*4-G#*4.</p><p>However, as Thomas Morley has well said, there are more ways to the<br/>woods than one, and those favoring pure concords wherever they do not<br/>cause major inconvenience might prefer a version like this:</p><p>                                7<br/>| 1   2  | 1    2  +  | 1   2  | 1   2 ,|<br/>  A4       A4           A&apos;4      G#*4<br/>  E&apos;4           D4 C4   D4       E*4<br/>  C&apos;4      A3           A&apos;3      B*&apos;3<br/>  A3       F3           F&apos;3      E*3</p><p>In this version there are still some tempered concords around the<br/>suspension itself, with a yet purer version requiring quartercomma<br/>shifts in the very process of the resolution:</p><p>                                7<br/>| 1   2  | 1    2   +  | 1   2  | 1   2 ,|<br/>  A4       A4   A&apos;4 A4   A&apos;4      G#*4<br/>  E&apos;4           D4  C&apos;4  D4       E*4<br/>  C&apos;4      A3   A&apos;3 A3   A&apos;3      B*&apos;3<br/>  A3       F3   F&apos;3 F3   F&apos;3      E*3</p><p>Often, as at measure 19, we encounter sonorities with intervals all of<br/>which cannot be pure within our 62-note system:</p><p>                              20<br/>| 1    2   | 1  +        2  | 1    2  , |<br/>  B*4  C*5      B*4 A*&apos;4 B*4  C*5<br/>  G*4  G&apos;*4  G*4              G*&apos;4<br/>  D*&apos;4 E*4   D*&apos;4             E*4<br/>  G*3  C*4   G*3              C*4</p><p>Neither the suspended fourth or eleventh C*5 nor the ornamental major<br/>second or ninth A*&apos;4 can participate in a sonority with all ratios<br/>pure (6:9:12:16 for the first sonority, and 4:6:8:9 for the second).<br/>In this kind of style, however, such sonorities are regarded as<br/>discords, so that the customary tempering of some of these fifths or<br/>fourths by 1/4 comma might be accounted of little musical moment.</p><p>-------------------------<br/>4. A conclusion, or envoi<br/>-------------------------</p><p>As an amicable and prudent counsel, I might guess that many ardent<br/>lovers of pure concords may be less acquainted with the subtleties of<br/>enharmonic or fifthtone music after the noble manner of Vicentino.<br/>For such listeners, it may well be the enharmonic shifts and<br/>progressions which especially catch the ear -- however pleasantly or<br/>otherwise.</p><p>In the age of Petrucci, Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam discoursed<br/>most eloquently upon the adage _Dulce bellum inexpertis_, &quot;War is<br/>sweet to the inexperienced,&quot; offering much wisdom and humanity which<br/>might yet serve the cause of peace and concord.</p><p>Might fifthtones, at least for some listeners, have the contrary<br/>property of growing sweeter with experience? Given the diversity of<br/>tastes, I would seek only to call attention to the special quality of<br/>these small steps, which some of us along with Vicentino find<br/>&quot;gentle,&quot; and, I might add, at the same time often delightfully<br/>astonishing.</p><p>It may have happened more than once that an unsuspecting theorist,<br/>upon first encoutering this enharmonic music, has taken as a comma<br/>shift for the sake of pure intonation what is actually a deliberate<br/>fifthtone inflection, and has ventured to propose a solution in which<br/>just concords may be achieved more &quot;smoothly.&quot;</p><p>Such are the vagaries of music by which even the most learned may be<br/>taken unawares, and here a friendly explanation may do much to nourish<br/>both understanding and mutual charity, however tastes may agree or<br/>diverge.</p><p>May the genius and beauty of Vicentino&apos;s music and tunings, whether<br/>realized through a 62-tone system or some other, lend a richer flavor<br/>to the musics of a new century and millennium.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>1. In his circular of 1561 advertising the arciorgano, this &quot;perfect<br/>diatonic music&quot; is described along with its marvellous effects, see,<br/>Henry W. Kaufman, &quot;Vicentino&apos;s Arciorgano: An Annotated Translation,&quot;<br/>_Journal of Music Theory_ 5:32-53 (1961) at 34-35.: &quot;First there are<br/>obtained perfect fifths above the white keys of the common organ,<br/>which make a wonderful sound; then two kinds of thirds, one major, one<br/>minor, and similarly, two kinds of sixths, in which case it happens<br/>that whenever perfect fifths are struck together with perfect thirds,<br/>they fill the ears with such harmony that no better can be heard on<br/>earth.&quot;</p><p>2. Actually, there are two slightly different alternatives for<br/>arranging the 62-note system based on a 31-note cycle of 1/4-comma<br/>meantone. The first alternative would be literally to transpose the<br/>first cycle up by a quartercomma; the second is to transpose up by a<br/>pure 3:2 fifth, and order all notes within a single octave. Using a<br/>31-note cycle of Fbb-G##, these alternatives would respectively yield<br/>an additional 31-note cycle at Fbb&apos;-G##&apos; -- an apostrophe (&apos;) here<br/>showing a note raised by a quartercomma -- or Cbb&apos;-D##&apos;. Apart from<br/>the question of Fbb&apos; or D##&apos;, the two methods yield identical 62-note<br/>tunings. In 1/4-comma meantone, the notes Fbb&apos; and D##&apos; differ by the<br/>&quot;31-note diesis&quot; of about 6.07 cents by which 31 tempered fifths fall<br/>short of 18 pure octaves, with Fbb&apos; higher than D##&apos;.</p><p>3. While, with a few exceptions of a kind discussed in Section 3, the<br/>sonorities in this piece should be pure as defined in the MIDI file<br/>(to within the nearest tuning unit), noticeable beating within these<br/>sonorities might nevertheless occur depending on various factors.</p><p>4. This arrangement is included with Scala as madonna.seq, a MIDI<br/>input file which may be used with the EXAMPLE command to generate a<br/>MIDI file. When I happened to learn of the EXAMPLE feature only about<br/>two months ago, madonna.seq dramatized for me the power of this<br/>feature and served as a convenient model or template for my own first<br/>efforts.</p><p>5. Following Vicentino&apos;s statement that in this tuning every key on<br/>the second manual is tuned in a &quot;just fifth&quot; to a key on the first<br/>manual (e.g. C-G&apos;), we have available a pure sonority without a<br/>tempered counterpart on that lower manual: B-D#&apos;-F##&apos;. With the second<br/>manual tuned in the slightly different arrangement of the first<br/>transposed up a quartercomma (Gb&apos;-Db&apos;), we would instead have<br/>available the pure sonority Eb-Gb&apos;-Bb&apos; in addition to the usual<br/>tempered form Eb-Gb-Bb already available on the lower manual.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=26945 href="#26945">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>8/13/2001 6:26:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thank you Margo, for all the praise.<br/>I will add a notation system to Scala that&apos;s capable<br/>of indicating 1/4-comma increments with an apostrophe<br/>like you did, and dedicate this to you, and Vicentino.</p><p>About Zarlino, Joseph, a drawing of his 19-tone keyboard<br/>design can be seen at <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/zarlino.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/zarlino.html</a><br/>The keys in black are red in reality.</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3><a id=26955 href="#26955">ðŸ”—</a>Clark &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2001 4:59:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Manuel wrote:</p><p>&gt; About Zarlino, Joseph, a drawing of his 19-tone keyboard<br/>&gt; design can be seen at <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/zarlino.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/zarlino.html</a><br/>&gt; The keys in black are red in reality.</p><p>Also check &lt;<a href="http://jackpeters.com/newphotos1.htm">http://jackpeters.com/newphotos1.htm</a>&gt;.

It makes no sense.</p><p>So s/he claims that the 5 chromatic keys, which correspond to the only<br/>5 in a 12-note Eb to G# meantone, which are coloured black on a<br/>standard 12-note keyboard, and which are coloured black on the<br/>drawing, are in fact red!</p><p>And does s/he claim that the additional 7 chromatic keys are really<br/>white (as on the drawing) or black?</p><p>There are clearly 3 classes of keys here. The 7 diatonic - the 5<br/>ordinary chromatic - the 7 extended chromatic. Why would anyone in<br/>their right mind colour them white-red-white and pass up the<br/>opportunity to use black? And if they were coloured white-red-black,<br/>why would any artist in their right mind draw both black and white as<br/>white? Lucky they didn&apos;t have zebra crossings back then or the artist<br/>might have been killed. ;-)</p><p>Those two considerations alone are sufficient, but ...</p><p>Furthermore, I think any artist or draughtsman, having a choice of<br/>only black or white with which to render red, would choose white.<br/>Chess and checkers pieces and boards are either black and white or<br/>black and red, never red and white, for good reason.</p><p>No. The only colourings that make any sense from that drawing, if we<br/>know for sure that one class is coloured red, are white-black-red or<br/>red-black-white. But clearly red is the non-standard colour here, so<br/>you wouldn&apos;t use it for the diatonic keys. Also, red, the colour of<br/>blood, says &quot;Warning, use only when absolutely necessary&quot;.</p><p>I think the 7 extended-chromatic keys were red.</p><p>&gt; I haven&apos;t seen Zarlino&apos;s 16-note JI keyboard.
