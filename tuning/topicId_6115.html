Anything else would be out of tune.</p><p>&gt;Sorry, I should have elaborated.  Pardon my ignorance, but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;understand, unless it&apos;s voice leading considerations (?), but the minor 7th<br/>&gt;in the Dmin7 chord is in tune at 9/5.  There&apos;st more stuff on the web I<br/>&gt;should read  before asking more inane questions in this direction, but all<br/>&gt;suggestions of good reading on why certain ratios are best in one chord and<br/>&gt;not another would be most welcome.</p><p>It&apos;s pretty simple in this case. In a Dmin7 chord, you&apos;ve got a Dmin,<br/>presumably 1/1 6/5 3/2. Where should the seventh be? Well, 9/5 forms a 3:2<br/>consonance with 6/5 and a 6:5 consonance with the 3/2. Any other seventh<br/>would fail to be as consonant. In a dominant seventh chord, you&apos;ve got a<br/>major triad, 1/1 5/4 3/2. A 7/4 forms very simple ratios with all other<br/>chord tones: 7:4, 7:5, and 7:6. No other seventh would be as consonant<br/>there.</p></div>
