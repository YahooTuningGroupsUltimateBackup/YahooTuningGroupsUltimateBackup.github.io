I can hear music in my head up to a certain level of<br/>complexity, that is, I can recreate an orchestra playing<br/>moderately complex stuff and &quot;hear&quot; it in good fidelity. I<br/>have experimented with trying to hear two different pieces<br/>at the same time, and can do this moderately well with some<br/>combinations, for instance I can &quot;hear&quot; a Beethoven symphony<br/>that I am very familiar with and &quot;hear&quot; a single instrument<br/>playing an entirely different, but again, familiar, piece at<br/>the same time. If I try to hear two *orchestras* playing<br/>moderately complex music at the same time, it pretty much<br/>falls apart. My wife, who is very visual, says that she can<br/>&quot;see&quot; movies in her head and can make them be anything she<br/>desires. Is there a known difference in humans&apos; ability to<br/>&quot;hear&quot; arbitrary sonic scapes versus the ability to &quot;see&quot;<br/>arbitrary visual scapes?</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=14552 href="#14552">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>10/17/2000 9:46:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John Starrett wrote,</p><p>&gt; Is there a known difference in humans&apos; ability to &quot;hear&quot; arbitrary<br/>sonic scapes versus the ability to &quot;see&quot; arbitrary visual scapes?</p><p>Hmm, good question! Speaking only from my own experience, I&apos;d say my<br/>&quot;quodlibet&quot; hearing and seeing abilities are about the same. I can get<br/>a lot up and running simultaneously, but the more I add the more<br/>blurry or &quot;transparent&quot; it all gets, and the composite is not<br/>something I can &quot;enjoy&quot; or even &quot;hear&quot; as it takes so much<br/>concentration to keep everything &quot;alive&quot;.</p><p>In my own music I&apos;m much more interested in the composite than I am in<br/>an ability to clearly delineate all the moving parts. In fact, I&apos;d say<br/>that they&apos;re much easier for me to &quot;hear&quot;/&quot;see&quot; when I&apos;m not over<br/>&quot;concerned&quot; about their exact what and whereabouts... I put them<br/>there, so know who they are by sight or by sound already!</p><p>--d.stearns</p></div><h3><a id=14565 href="#14565">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2000 5:40:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[John Starrett wrote:]<br/>&gt;Just because a piece of music is traditionally played in<br/>&gt;12tet, and the composer is of an era in which 12tet was<br/>&gt;firmly established, does not mean the piece is 12tet.
