Iannis Xenakis, may he rest FINALLY in peace,<br/>immediately comes to mind.  Have you ever read his book, &quot;Formalized<br/>Music?&quot;  The math in parts is too intense for me, personally, but YOU<br/>could probably cut it.  I believe he uses such techniques, generated<br/>by computer, for the construction of &quot;sound clouds&quot; but you, or<br/>someone else, may like to verify....</p><p>___________ ______ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
