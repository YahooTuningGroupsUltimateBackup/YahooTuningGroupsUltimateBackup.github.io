Jim French has been making Dulcitars, a drone like instrument with<br/>10 strings in which one side plays a harmonically based scale and the other side a<br/>subharmonic. On one side, the open strings is tuned c-g-c while the other side is tuned g-c-g.<br/>Even though these are the same, having them considered as part of reciprocal series makes the<br/>fretted scales possible. This made me realize that such a chord  thought of in a subharmonic<br/>context opens the possibilities toward new modulations as well as harmonic progressions. This<br/>is somewhat similar to the case of the  full dim. chord in 12 et. the spelling and conception<br/>(as well as the context) determines how it is used.</p><p>&quot;M. Schulter&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello, Paul, and Carl, and everyone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please let me begin by thanking you, Paul, for making a very important<br/>&gt; point. If Partch defines &quot;otonal/utonal&quot; as a relationship between<br/>&gt; sonorities which cannot be obtained from each other by Rameau&apos;s<br/>&gt; process of inversion (octave transposition of voices), then indeed<br/>&gt; this concept does _not_ properly apply to 3-limit trines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Accordingly, respecting Partch&apos;s premises and definitions, I would<br/>&gt; amend my original position to say that the contrast between the two<br/>&gt; &quot;flavors&quot; of trines I describe may be in some ways musically<br/>&gt; _analogous_ to that reflected by the &quot;otonal/utonal&quot; concept with<br/>&gt; which I am familiar mainly from discussions on this list.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the same time, Carl, I would like to thank you for sharing your own<br/>&gt; musical perceptions and helping me to validate my own feeling that the<br/>&gt; contrast between the two basic flavors of 3-limit trines and 5-limit<br/>&gt; triads are indeed analogous.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rather than using the &quot;otonal/utonal&quot; concept where Paul has taught me<br/>&gt; it does not properly apply, I might better present an analysis using<br/>&gt; the terms and concepts of medieval and Renaissance theory, the basis<br/>&gt; of much of my own outlook. This process may require a number of posts,<br/>&gt; somewhat technical but I hope also readable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I would like mainly to answer a few of Paul&apos;s questions about<br/>&gt; matters of musical feeling. The question of artistic perceptions and<br/>&gt; motivations may be at least as important as the mathematical logic of<br/>&gt; a given approach to theory, and may thus be an ideal place to start.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, I would say that in a Gothic setting, a 3-limit trine with<br/>&gt; octave, fifth, and fourth sounds indeed more &quot;complete&quot; to me than a<br/>&gt; simple fifth or fourth -- rather like a 5-limit triad is more<br/>&gt; &quot;complete&quot; than a simple major or minor third. A medieval theorist<br/>&gt; such as Johannes de Grocheio (1300) likewise says that _three_ voices<br/>&gt; are required in order to &quot;perfect a consonance&quot; -- that is, to achieve<br/>&gt; full saturation by sounding the musical &quot;Trinity&quot; of the octave,<br/>&gt; fifth, and fourth simultaneously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Further, I would say that a simple fifth has a flavor musically akin<br/>&gt; to that of a complete trine with the fifth placed below and the fourth<br/>&gt; above; and a simple fourth to the converse arrangement with the fourth<br/>&gt; below and fifth above. This is analogous to the kinship of the simple<br/>&gt; major third to a triad with the major third below and the minor third<br/>&gt; above; and conversely for the simple minor third.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Using my notation for three-note/interval sonorities where the<br/>&gt; intervals are shown as (outer|lower + upper), these affinities might<br/>&gt; be shown as follows, with examples of trines and triads given in MIDI<br/>&gt; notation where C4 indicates middle C:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Limit         Simple interval            Kindred trinic/triadic flavor<br/>&gt;    -----         ---------------            -----------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      3                  5                   (8|5 + 4), e.g. D3-A3-D4<br/>&gt;      3                  4                   (8|4 + 5), e.g. D3-G3-D4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      5                 M3                   (5|M3 + m3), e.g. G3-B3-D4<br/>&gt;      5                 m3                   (5|m3 + M3), e.g. G3-Bb3-D4<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note that a complete 3-limit trine includes two richly stable 3-limit<br/>&gt; intervals of a similar but distinct quality, the fifth and fourth,<br/>&gt; plus an interval from the next lower limit, the 2-limit octave.<br/>&gt; Similarly, the complete 5-limit triad includes two similar but<br/>&gt; distinct 5-limit intervals, the major and minor third, plus an<br/>&gt; interval from the next lower limit, the 3-limit fifth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In either 3-limit or 5-limit music, I would make a distinction between<br/>&gt; a &quot;simple&quot; two-voice interval and a &quot;bare&quot; or &quot;open&quot; one. A fifth or<br/>&gt; fourth in 3-limit (trinic) music, and likewise a major or minor third<br/>&gt; in 5-limit music, represents a richly stable interval. Thus I would<br/>&gt; call such an interval &quot;simple&quot; (in comparison to a complete trine or<br/>&gt; triad), but not &quot;open&quot; or &quot;bare.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In contrast, from a musical as well as logical point of view, I might<br/>&gt; indeed speak of a &quot;bare&quot; or &quot;open&quot; octave in trinic music, and<br/>&gt; likewise of a &quot;bare&quot; or &quot;open&quot; fifth in triadic music -- respectively<br/>&gt; a 2-limit interval in a 3-limit setting, or a 3-limit interval in a<br/>&gt; 5-limit setting. As the term &quot;open&quot; may suggest, in either case such<br/>&gt; an interval seems to invite the addition of a third middle voice<br/>&gt; dividing it into the richly euphonious fifth and fourth of a complete<br/>&gt; trine, or major and minor third of a complete triad.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;From a psychological point of view, I suspect that the 2-limit octave<br/>&gt; may serve as an integral interval of a 3-limit trine because it is<br/>&gt; only one step below the limit of saturation; thus it has a greater<br/>&gt; sonorous impact than when added to a 5-limit triad, where it is two<br/>&gt; steps removed from the limit of saturation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Terminology and math aside, the importance of the octave in a complete<br/>&gt; trine really hit me when I heard a performance of one of Perotin&apos;s<br/>&gt; three-voice organa on an album called _Vox humana_. To open the piece,<br/>&gt; the ensemble played first the lowest voice alone, then added the<br/>&gt; second voice at the fifth -- and only after allowing some time to<br/>&gt; appreciate this process did they finally add the third voice at the<br/>&gt; octave, triumphantly completing the trine! The richness and resonance<br/>&gt; was transcendent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thus in trinic music I regard the octave as an integral interval not<br/>&gt; only because it fits medieval theory and has mathematical attractions,<br/>&gt; but because it concords with my musical experience. In 5-limit or<br/>&gt; higher music, treating the octave as more of a mere &quot;doubling&quot; or<br/>&gt; &quot;replication&quot; may reflect its lesser perceived sonorousness vis-a-vis<br/>&gt; a unison as the texture becomes more dense, the norm of stable<br/>&gt; saturation more complex.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed, such differences should caution us that analogies are just<br/>&gt; that, as opposed to equations: 3-limit and 5-limit musics are<br/>&gt; different systems, and one can focus on either the differences or the<br/>&gt; similarities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most respectfully,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=10319 href="#10319">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

There appears to<br/>be an additional phenomenon, &quot;rootedness&quot;, which gives the lowest sounding<br/>note an extra probabilistic boost in its likelihood of being interpreted as<br/>octave-equivalent to the fundamental. This would explain why, for example,<br/>4:5:6 is more &quot;consonant&quot; than 3:4:5. Unlike roughness and tonalness, this<br/>component of consonance appears inextricably linked to octave-equivalence,<br/>so (wildly speculating) may reflect some non-linear processing in the brain,<br/>in which period-doubling behavior may be linked to the perception of<br/>especially the lowest sounding note -- and perhaps to melodies as well --<br/>something that could have evolved as an aid to pattern recognition???????</p></div>
