This isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; LucyTuned, though, is it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>There are only two chords in this piece, E and F#m.<br/>It was produced within Logic Pro 7 using song tuning tables for virtual instruments as at:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html">http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html</a></p><p>and real LucyTuned guitars.</p><p>It was then bounced into audio and some of the vocals put on, and effects added including Melodyne corrections.<br/>The audio was then transposed within Logic to about Ab and Bbm, and further vocals and effects added.<br/>So it does not strictly conform to A4=440Hz or the pitch to tempo concept, but the chords and harmony are certainly LucyTuned<br/>It is still a work in progress though as one of the major record labels are working with us on it.</p><p>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@lucytune.com">lucy@lucytune.com</a> ------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  ------- for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies, contest and Flash cartoon go to<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy CD from:<br/><a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a><br/>Lullabies at iTunes (if you already have iTunes installed):<br/><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?a=5165209&s=143441">http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?a=5165209&s=143441</a><br/>To install iTunes go to:<br/><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/download/">http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/download/</a></p></div>
