Erlich &#x3C;PErlich@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/1999 4:33:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt;According to [Dave Keenan], that sum models critical-band roughness<br/>very well up to ratios of 17</p><p>Re-reading Dave&apos;s e-mail to me, I see that the sum only models<br/>critical-band roughness well if the _sum_ is 17 or less. So intervals<br/>like 11/8 and 13/8 are already too complex for this type of formula, as<br/>they are too close to other ratios of similar complexity to be clearly<br/>distinguished from them. Note that my harmonic entropy model, to the<br/>accuracy that I&apos;ve evaluated it so far, did not show local minima at<br/>11/8 or 13/8, but there was a very tiny one at 11/6.</p><p>Joe Monzo noted that he could not fit 11/6 in with the other minima in a<br/>3-d lattice. To the entire enterprise of creating that lattice, I would<br/>reply that the minima are not really a scale, except that they represent<br/>the points you might stop at if tuning one note against a fixed pitch.<br/>They are not conceived in relation to one another, although many of them<br/>happen to be quite consonant with one another. Lattice diagrams are<br/>useful when trying to grasp _all_ the interrelationships within a scale.<br/>The harmonic entropy concept can be applied to all those<br/>interrelationships, not just the ones formed with a single tonic. So if<br/>you were really going to derive a scale (for a type of music in which a<br/>lattice is relevant) from the harmonic entropy concept, you would not<br/>simply take the minima and construct them all upwards from a single<br/>tonic.</p></div>
