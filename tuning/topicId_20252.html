At the Berinsky Club<br/>tonight, a couple of my pieces were played and I was talking about<br/>how perhaps just intonation is a way to relate with PERCEPTION in<br/>music, so that people can relate corporally to the music.  The<br/>audience seemed quite interested and it was a nice discussion.</p><p>Staying in Moscow at a wonderful hotel affiliated with the Composers<br/>Union.  It&apos;s very reasonable because of that.</p><p>best to everybody on the list</p><p>Joseph/Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=20260 href="#20260">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>3/16/2001 6:09:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., pehrson@p... wrote:<br/>&gt; Well, lots of interesting microtonal discussion here in Moscow and<br/>&gt; Bryansk.</p><p>Wishing you well on the rest of your trip, and marvelling at the<br/>wonders of our age, where /you/ physically travel to share the music<br/>and information, and /we/ share in the (virtual) experience from your<br/>posts.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div>
