Clearly we&apos;re<br/>comparing capabilities to play in a variety of tunings, but just what<br/>are we after in deciding whether a given synthesizer is &quot;useful&quot; or<br/>not for this or that musical style?</p><p>Often we tend to use general terms like &quot;alternative tunings&quot; or<br/>&quot;microtonal music,&quot; but these terms are indeed general.</p><p>For example, if we seek some alternative to defining &quot;microtonal&quot;<br/>music as &quot;music in any tuning except ones I don&apos;t care for,&quot; then we<br/>might say that _all_ music is &quot;microtonal,&quot; or try to articulate some<br/>rough definition like &quot;involving intervals smaller than a usual scale<br/>step in this or that musical tradition.&quot;</p><p>If we&apos;re addressing the kinds of tunings often discussed in this<br/>forum, then maybe we have at least three categories of interest:</p><p>(1) Tunings calling for 12 or fewer notes per octave, with 12 an<br/>adequate number, for example, for a great range of Western European<br/>repertories in medieval Pythagorean, Renaissance/Manneristic meantone,<br/>or later Baroque/Classic/Romantic well-temperaments, not to mention<br/>20th-century serial compositions in 12-tone equal temperament<br/>(12-tET).</p><p>(2) Tunings calling for between 13 and 24 notes per octave, ranging<br/>from experimental Pythagorean, meantone, or multi-prime just<br/>intonation (JI) schemes to complete equal temperaments such as 22-tET,<br/>or subsets of many others.</p><p>(3) Tunings calling for more than 24 notes per octave, for example<br/>equal temperaments or other full circulating tunings requiring this<br/>larger number of notes.</p><p>In category (1), a single keyboard/synthesizer with octave tuning<br/>capabilities should meet most needs, and I would say that this is a<br/>non-trivial set of music ranging from the historical repertories<br/>mentioned above to pentatonic and heptatonic schemes from various<br/>parts of the world to 11-tET, for example. This category also includes<br/>subsets of up to 12 notes from regular tunings that happen also to be<br/>n-tET&apos;s which would close with a larger set of notes.</p><p>In category (2), we could use a system of two independently tuneable<br/>keyboards each with its own octave tuning, either supported by<br/>separate synthesizers or by a single synthesizer with &quot;part-tuning&quot;<br/>capabilities. Of course, some people for at least some applications in<br/>this category might prefer a custom keyboard with more than 12 notes<br/>per octave, and that could well call for non-octave-tuning<br/>capabilities for a synthesizer supporting it.</p><p>In category (3), we clearly need non-octave tuning -- except in a<br/>system based on three or more 12-note keyboards, maybe each supported<br/>by its own synthesizers (the polyphonic limits of a single synthesizer<br/>even with part-tunings could become an issue here).</p><p>Maybe my discussion of category (2) is in part hypothetical, because<br/>I&apos;m not sure about synthesizers which have part-tuning capabilities<br/>but not support for non-octave tunings. Of course, it&apos;s further a plus<br/>to have non-octave tunings available as an option even if one chooses<br/>to use octave tunings on two keyboards.</p><p>One possible addition to the Microtonal Synthesis site might be a<br/>fuller discussion of these points with some musical examples of each<br/>of the three categories, and maybe some material on the fit between<br/>synthesizer tunings and alternative keyboards with more than 12 notes<br/>per octave.</p><p>From what I&apos;ve seen, John Loffink&apos;s Microtonal Synthesis site is a<br/>helpful and informative resource for which many of us have benefitted,<br/>and if we approach this issue as an opportunity to suggest how the<br/>site might be made even more helpful, isn&apos;t that a friendly outlook<br/>for the new year?</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=17010 href="#17010">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>12/30/2000 6:11:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; In category (3), we clearly need non-octave tuning -- except in a<br/>&gt; system based on three or more 12-note keyboards, maybe each supported<br/>&gt; by its own synthesizers (the polyphonic limits of a single synthesizer<br/>&gt; even with part-tunings could become an issue here).</p><p>Well, quite.  Even if you&apos;re using a non-octave tuning, octave-based<br/>tuning tables are far from useless.</p><p>&gt; Maybe my discussion of category (2) is in part hypothetical, because<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure about synthesizers which have part-tuning capabilities<br/>&gt; but not support for non-octave tunings. Of course, it&apos;s further a plus<br/>&gt; to have non-octave tunings available as an option even if one chooses<br/>&gt; to use octave tunings on two keyboards.</p><p>Any fully GM-compliant synth should support the coarse and fine tuning<br/>parameters.  I thought these were something to do with pitch bends, but<br/>apparently they&apos;re for transposition.  So, any of the 16 (15 if it&apos;s<br/>strict GM) channels can be tuned up or down an arbitrary number of cents.<br/> Combine that with an octave tuning table, and you can do a fair bit.<br/>It&apos;s less convenient than a full keyboard table, but certainly not<br/>useless.</p><p>The transposition can also be changed in real-time.  So, if you&apos;re playing<br/>a 12 note riff in 88-CET, and you want to change &quot;key&quot;, well, no problem.</p><p>Even if you don&apos;t have that capability, you may well find some<br/>instruments don&apos;t even need more than 12 notes.</p><p>It&apos;s nice to see pitch bends being counted as &quot;microtonal&quot; now.  There was<br/>a time when people said they were &quot;useless&quot; as well.  Now I&apos;ve got<br/>software to add them automatically, it means even synths without tuning<br/>tables cease to be useless for microtonal work.</p><p>So let&apos;s remember there are still big problems with this method.  You&apos;re<br/>essentially limited to 16 (or 15) note polyphony.  And with the software<br/>as it stands, the pitch bends have to be embedded in the MIDI file.  So,<br/>if you move notes around in a sequencer, the pitch bends won&apos;t go with<br/>them.  It would be nice if somebody wrote a program that could listen on<br/>multiple channels, and so the retuning.  Until they do, pitch bend tuning<br/>isn&apos;t really suitable for serious work.  So I&apos;d rather have octave-based<br/>tables any day.</p><p>My Korg X5D has one user-defined octave-based tuning table.  It also<br/>supports the GM transposition messages, +/- 2 octaves, on 16 channels by<br/>the looks of it.  But the combination mode lets you go further.</p><p>You can combine 8 voices at a time.  Each is assigned a channel, and a key<br/>and velocity range.  And each can be transposed +/- 2 octaves with 1 cent<br/>precision.  So, if you only want one timbre (as you thought the machine<br/>was useless, that&apos;s one better than you expected) you can get nearly 8<br/>octaves of, say, 88-CET or my schismic fourth tuning, by combining the<br/>user tuning table with key ranges and transposition.</p><p>Not that I&apos;ve tried this yet.  It&apos;d be much easier to throw up a<br/>full-keyboard table in Scala and send it across.  But for a spare<br/>instrument, octave tunings are a lot better than nothing.  More than that,<br/>they&apos;re useful to have around.  Given a choice, I&apos;d have both, like on my<br/>TX81Z.  If you spend a lot of time using octave-based scales, it&apos;s a real<br/>convenience to only have to key in 12 numbers on the front panel.</p><p>Yes, for perfect microtonality you need arbitrary tuning to better than<br/>0.1 cent precision.  If that&apos;s what you want, stop complaining and start<br/>saving up for Kyma.  I did.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=17012 href="#17012">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>12/30/2000 6:46:45 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.

That of the<br/>synthesizer&apos;s method of tone generation.</p><p>To elaborate;  Basically there are two general categories of tone<br/>generation which are at work in almost any kind of sound synthesis:<br/>1. &quot;Oscillator Synthesis&quot;, and 2. &quot;Sample Playback&quot;.  Both of these<br/>having distinct advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>For &quot;Oscillator Synthesis&quot;, possibly its greatest microtonally<br/>related attribute is the ability to synthesize perfectly sustaining<br/>tones (if desired), and perhaps an occasional weakness, is that while<br/>it can be capable of doing *some* good acoustic emulations, it is<br/>perhaps weaker on this point and better at generation of<br/>more &quot;electronic&quot; sounding timbres.</p><p>For &quot;Sample Playback&quot;, its strength is the ability to render more<br/>convincing emulations of acoustic instruments, *BUT* - and I mean<br/>major *but* for the microtonalist, is in the case of &quot;General Midi<br/>Sound Cards&quot; and &quot;General Midi Modules&quot;. Wherever the sample playback<br/>General Midi sound set is at work, one will observe the uniquely<br/>idiosyncratic behavior of short &quot;Looped Samples&quot;.  Since I have been<br/>actively doing my own electronic sound design for over 22 years, I<br/>will allow myself the license to point this out to folks that may be<br/>getting ready to &quot;drop the wad&quot; on a new synth.</p><p>Try this little test with your GM_whatever (I&apos;ve got 2 too!):  Pick<br/>out any single acoustic instrument sample, and remove all reverb and<br/>chorus (please note that GM sound designers bathe their sounds in an<br/>ocean of effects, in an effort to disguise what I&apos;m revealing here).<br/>Hold down a single note in the middle range of the keyboard and<br/>listen. Hear that? That bumpy cycled sound you hear is from trying to<br/>make sounds as short as they can be, by looping the sustain stage of<br/>a timbre. This is important with these GM modules, because the sound<br/>designer&apos;s goal is to shoe-horn as much as possible into the small<br/>amount of available memory. Now play a couple of notes - what do you<br/>hear? Twice as much &quot;warbbly/skippy&quot; effect!  I submit here that<br/>this &quot;broken record effect&quot; *does* affect ones perception of<br/>microtonal subtleties (more than a 768 tuning unit synth!), and where<br/>one is solely reliant upon this method of sound generation for their<br/>microtonal work, and is seeking to perceive &quot;audible&quot; tuning effects,<br/>then there is no doubt that this will &quot;influence&quot; the way you hear<br/>microtonality. This speaks a little to my personal feeling about the<br/>futility of doing convincing orchestral emulations with these GM<br/>things (something I&apos;ve did hours-upon-hours of recordings of).  It&apos;s<br/>always going to take active participation and imagination from the<br/>listener to appreciate the &quot;cheese factor&quot;, because more than likely,<br/>they&apos;ll be more preoccupied with how *unlike* an orchestra it really<br/>is, an not even pay attention to the content of the music.</p><p>However, with a full blown sampler, one does not necessarily have to<br/>loop sounds, but may have long single tones from real instruments,<br/>thus avoiding the GM &quot;bumps in the road&quot;. Certainly this is the<br/>better solution.</p><p>So, I think these are two important points to consider when thinking<br/>about new sound modules/keyboards. I routinely use both in my work,<br/>and have sort of grown toward accepting the idiosyncratic behavior of<br/>these instruments, in the way one would a guitar or any acoustic<br/>instrument.  But I must here state my feeling that &quot;factory patches<br/>must die&quot;.  This will drag us all into a pit if we don&apos;t get the<br/>point when putting out CDs of microtonal music.  Folks may go away<br/>from the experience of that &quot;Grand GM Opus&quot;, thinking microtonalists<br/>should seek psychiatric help. Dig into sound design folks! For the<br/>cause! Electronic music just plain &quot;sucks&quot; if you don&apos;t; it doesn&apos;t<br/>matter how you tune it!  GM is the progeny of Grandma&apos;s old organ,<br/>with the Foxtrot and Waltz beats, and the old Casio VL-Tone (I know<br/>you young whipper snappers don&apos;t remember that glorious sine toy!);<br/>where the effort to provide the commercial &quot;Swiss Army Knife&quot; sound<br/>set, leaves the microtonalist with something that millions of other<br/>folks have by exact factory duplication. Microtonalists would never<br/>accept a fixed factory tuning set, and should also *never* accept the<br/>factory sound set for professional recording work.</p><p>I&apos;ll wrap this up with the following suggestion:  Only release music<br/>that is impeccable! You know what I&apos;m talking about. When you are<br/>composing, producing and recording music, think about your favorite<br/>pieces of great music, that would serve as models for the criteria<br/>of &quot;long term listenability&quot;. And ask yourself:  &quot;Can my music endure<br/>repeated listenings?&quot; &quot;And do I ever want to hear this again?&quot; Well<br/>folks if the answer is no to either of the questions, it&apos;s better for<br/>the entire microtonal movement that you keep it right in the old<br/>bedroom studio. Let&apos;s raise the level of musical quality and thus<br/>raise the cause of microtonality, that we so adore, into public<br/>perception. I submit this will never happen if we release microtonal<br/>music that is incapable of enduring repeated listenings. Get a model<br/>of excellence in mind for yourself and ask honestly how your work<br/>compares to your cherished model.</p><p>Only release music that is impeccable! I suggest to withdraw music<br/>that you know yourself has not achieved this, as everything that<br/>comes out of our quarter, represents our cause, so there is no room<br/>for sloth and slackers, and lame music - no matter what your chosen<br/>compositional idiom. We never know when someone who&apos;s curious about<br/>microtonality will come to our <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a> pages or home pages, and have<br/>the &quot;first impressions are the most dramatic&quot; experience.  Always ask<br/>yourself: &quot;What will be the dramatic &quot;first impression&quot; that I will<br/>convey to the uninitiated, or seasoned listener?&quot;</p><p>Only release music that is impeccable! This should become our<br/>Microtonal Mantra.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; For example, if we seek some alternative to defining &quot;microtonal&quot;<br/>&gt; music as &quot;music in any tuning except ones I don&apos;t care for,&quot; then we<br/>&gt; might say that _all_ music is &quot;microtonal,&quot; or try to articulate<br/>some<br/>&gt; rough definition like &quot;involving intervals smaller than a usual<br/>scale<br/>&gt; step in this or that musical tradition.&quot;</p><p>This is a good point, and I think this is wrapped in one&apos;s subjective<br/>view and experience. It also brings to mind the repeated statement in<br/>this forum of &quot;music sounding in tune&quot;.</p><p>I propose that when one is preparing to use the well worn &quot;this music<br/>should, could, would, does or doesn&apos;t sound in tune&quot;, they should<br/>fill in the blank at the end of the sentence with &quot;IMHO relative to<br/>____.&quot;  Because it&apos;s the &quot;relative to ____.&quot; that speaks to what<br/>tuning systems you are accustomed to hearing.  Now, this is not to re-<br/>stir the sediments of the OED/JI/Keenanian definition thing (god<br/>forbid!!!) - I&apos;m not talking about intoning 2 intervals and listening<br/>for justness. I&apos;m talking about full musical textures, in the context<br/>of full compositions - the reality outside the laboratory. When one<br/>says &quot;in-tune relative to ____.&quot;, they are merely reflecting their<br/>subjective experience (or lack thereof), of broad spectrums of tuning<br/>possibilities. If one is only used to 5 to 7 Limit JI or 12 tET, then<br/>more complex structures will be beyond the scope of their listening<br/>experience, thereby possibly being perceived as &quot;out of tune&quot;. I like<br/>to refer to this as &quot;personal tuning conditioning&quot;; something I<br/>believe all microtonalists experience (just like cultural tuning<br/>conditioning, except on a much more accelerated level). I avoid this<br/>absurd description for compositions, and only find value in it when<br/>listening to isolated intervals outside of the context of fully<br/>orchestrated pieces. It makes one wonder what would be the opinion of<br/>the &quot;out of tuners&quot; about Arabic music or Gamelan for instance - see<br/>what I mean? Take off your lab coats and banish this from your<br/>thought process (it&apos;s so obviously based in subjectivity)!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we&apos;re addressing the kinds of tunings often discussed in this<br/>&gt; forum, then maybe we have at least three categories of interest:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (1) Tunings calling for 12 or fewer notes per octave, with 12 an<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (2) Tunings calling for between 13 and 24 notes per octave, ranging<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (3) Tunings calling for more than 24 notes per octave, for example<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In category (1), a single keyboard/synthesizer with octave tuning<br/>&gt; capabilities should meet most needs, &gt;<br/>&gt; In category (2), we could use a system of two independently tunable<br/>&gt; keyboards each with its own octave tuning, &gt;<br/>&gt; In category (3), we clearly need non-octave tuning -- except in a<br/>&gt; system based on three or more 12-note keyboards, &gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is a very good breakdown, and I would like to say that what I<br/>think Mr. McLaren was trying to get at, is that if the synth has the<br/>full keyboard arbitrary tuning capability, then it would fill all of<br/>the above needs in one box. This is a most important feature for<br/>anyone who wishes to have the flexibility to tune anyway they see<br/>fit, or need to.  I can tell you that I wish every synth I had could<br/>do this, but the sadness is, I&apos;ve got a few modules that will only<br/>support octave tunings, so I must do some creative subsetting with<br/>these. It would be quite a tuning utopia to have full retuning for<br/>all though. Believe me folks, you *will* want this capability in your<br/>synth. You may not realize it at first, but you will. Don&apos;t settle<br/>for less. I will never again.</p><p>And while we are on the topic:</p><p>In:</p><p><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16911">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16911</a></p><p>Jacky Ligon wrote,</p><p>&gt;&gt;Someone<br/>&gt;&gt;really thought this &quot;768&quot; out really well - it works!</p><p>&gt;Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t know . . . Daniel Wolf is fond of pointing out that in 768,<br/>the best<br/>&gt;approximation of 3/2, doubled, does not equal the best approximation<br/>of 9/4.<br/>&gt;In other words, it&apos;s not consistent in the 9-limit. Meanwhile, 1200-<br/>tET is<br/>&gt;consistent in the 9-limit.</p><p>But Paul, this shouldn&apos;t be a problem for you, since you have told me<br/>in the past how you like to tune a few cents away from just, to avoid<br/>phase locked partials. So you should consider this a feature of a 768<br/>tuning base instrument (as I do). I&apos;d wager that at just about any<br/>given moment of playing the guitar, from varying finger pressures on<br/>the strings, one would experience greater tuning discrepancies than<br/>would be found on a 768 fixed tuning table synth. And it&apos;s certainly<br/>more than likely that the average overall adherence (in the course of<br/>performance) to the desired tuning would be at least as good, if not<br/>much better, and more consistent, than the guitar.

Both of these<br/>&gt; having distinct advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure whether this is a useful distinction or not. All *digital*<br/>sound generation systems, at least those I&apos;m aware of, operate by using an<br/>*algorithm* to generate samples of a *fixed size* at a *fixed sampling rate*<br/>suitably above something called the *Nyquist rate*. This fixed sampling rate<br/>is necessary for a lot of the mathematical analysis, aka digital signal<br/>processing, to work. It is not the optimum choice, just a convenience. If<br/>that reminds you of 12-TET as a convenience relative to all possible tuning<br/>schemes, that was my intention. :-)</p><p>Given that fact, whether the samples are generated by oscillator and filter<br/>algorithms, physical modeling algorithms, sample table lookup or some<br/>combination of these is more or less irrelevant. The choice of algorithm<br/>depends mostly on the cost of computation ... high-speed computers and DSP<br/>chips are more expensive than low-speed ones, multiprocessor systems are<br/>more expensive than single processor systems, large memories are more<br/>expensive than small ones, and complicated algorithms are more expensive to<br/>develop and debug than simple algorithms. There is also the issue of whether<br/>the sound needs to be generated in real time or not. In studio-based<br/>composition, one can let a computer grind for an hour to produce a minute of<br/>sound; on the stage, one cannot.</p><p>&gt; For &quot;Oscillator Synthesis&quot;, possibly its greatest microtonally<br/>&gt; related attribute is the ability to synthesize perfectly sustaining<br/>&gt; tones (if desired), and perhaps an occasional weakness, is that while<br/>&gt; it can be capable of doing *some* good acoustic emulations, it is<br/>&gt; perhaps weaker on this point and better at generation of<br/>&gt; more &quot;electronic&quot; sounding timbres.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For &quot;Sample Playback&quot;, its strength is the ability to render more<br/>&gt; convincing emulations of acoustic instruments, *BUT* - and I mean<br/>&gt; major *but* for the microtonalist, is in the case of &quot;General Midi<br/>&gt; Sound Cards&quot; and &quot;General Midi Modules&quot;.

My understanding is that<br/>microtonality and its cousin xentonality require accurate pitch and spectrum<br/>generation above all else. This is something that all digital sound creation<br/>methods share, and not unique to any specific algorithm.</p><p>Again, is the goal is &quot;convincing emulations of acoustic instruments&quot; or<br/>microtonal/xentonal music? I haven&apos;t heard any of your music, so I don&apos;t<br/>know what sorts of sounds you use, and, more important, whether you are a<br/>studio composer or a composer for live performance. That makes a big<br/>difference.</p><p>[snip]</p><p>&gt; But I must here state my feeling that &quot;factory patches<br/>&gt; must die&quot;.

Most of us are basically<br/>musicians; we need an interface other than pages of equations or code, we<br/>need *rapid* auditory feedback and a *parsimonious* set of tweakable<br/>parameters, and we need to keep the costs under control.

I suggest to withdraw music<br/>&gt; that you know yourself has not achieved this, as everything that<br/>&gt; comes out of our quarter, represents our cause, so there is no room<br/>&gt; for sloth and slackers, and lame music - no matter what your chosen<br/>&gt; compositional idiom. We never know when someone who&apos;s curious about<br/>&gt; microtonality will come to our <a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a> pages or home pages, and have<br/>&gt; the &quot;first impressions are the most dramatic&quot; experience.  Always ask<br/>&gt; yourself: &quot;What will be the dramatic &quot;first impression&quot; that I will<br/>&gt; convey to the uninitiated, or seasoned listener?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Only release music that is impeccable! This should become our<br/>&gt; Microtonal Mantra.</p><p>I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible to know what is &quot;impeccable&quot; immediately,<br/>although it is usually possible to recognize stuff that really stinks right<br/>away! :-) Today&apos;s concert repertoire is filled with works -- works we<br/>cherish today -- that were greeted with boos, disdain from critics, and<br/>worse. In my mind, the cardinal sins are two:</p><p>1. To produce *no* music because one is a perfectionist and must have it<br/>exactly right, and</p><p>2. To produce music that is boring. I would rather have people scream that<br/>*my* music is terrible than have them *ignore* my music out of boredom while<br/>screaming that *someone else&apos;s* really reeks. Because that someone else is<br/>going to be a Beethoven, Stravinsky or Shostakovich.<br/>--<br/>M.
