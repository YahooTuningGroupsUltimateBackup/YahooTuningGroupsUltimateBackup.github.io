But even traditional sources can be troublesome. Every westerner would say the west plays in 12 ET. But if take a recording of a Brahm&apos;s string quartet from 50 years ago and took measurements, it would not be what we find. In fact one of the things one can notice in older recordings of classical music is often the tolerance in pitch is much greater than today. i have no reason to believe this is better say 100 years ago or more. Keyboards and frets would have escape this depending on the skill at hand.<br/>   I remember one prominent Butoh Dancer from Japan who would appropriate  aspects of what he witnessed when performing abroad. He received some criticism of this. he responded that he was not afraid to misunderstand, and that misunderstanding was the beginning of communication.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p><a href="mailto:microstick@msn.com">microstick@msn.com</a> wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Interesting discussion on what/why the Chinese/Japanese/Tuvans &gt; use/choose the scales they may/may not be using, or have used.
