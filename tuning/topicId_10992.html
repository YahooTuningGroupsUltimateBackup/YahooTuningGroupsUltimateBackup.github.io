For the dictionary, a<br/>link to the Gentle introduction may be the best bet.</p><p>I&apos;ll take a stab anyway:</p><p>We can take the pitches in a tuning, represent them as dots,<br/>and arrange them in a space so that where any two pitches are<br/>seperated by a consonant interval, that interval can be shown<br/>as a straight line connecting the two dots (pitches) involved.</p><p>We can define any set of intervals we want as being consonant,<br/>and we can always arrange the dots of any tuning so that _all_<br/>our consonances are shown as straight lines, with none of the<br/>lines crossing, if our space has enough dimensions.  Sound like<br/>Dr. Who yet?  :)</p><p>Anyway, these spaces are called tonespaces -- usually, we<br/>consider the intervals of just intonation (at some limit)<br/>consonant, but really we can use any intervals we want.</p><p>Let&apos;s say we use JI.  Consonant intervals are written as<br/>fractions in JI.  In order to keep our lines from crossing,<br/>we need one dimension for every number appearing in a<br/>numerator or denominator in our list of consonances.<br/>Usually, we abide by octave-equivalence, where factors of<br/>2 are ignored, so that a dot represents all octave copies<br/>of its pitch.</p><p>One of the simplest and most common tonespaces is the two-<br/>factor space of the 5-limit.  Our list of consonances is:<br/>(1:1, 5:4, 8:5, 3:2, 4:3, 6:5, 5:3).  Ignoring the 2&apos;s, we<br/>only need the numbers 3 and 5 to write all these fractions.<br/>So we need two dimensions, x and y.  Adding a 3 to a<br/>numerator will move us + on x, adding a 3 to a denominator<br/>will be a - move on x.  Same for the 5&apos;s and y.  So:</p><p>    5/4-----15/8---45/32<br/>    / \     / \    /<br/>   /   \   /   \  /<br/>  /     \ /     \/<br/>1/1----3/2-----9/8</p><p>Every line on this diagram is in our list of consonances,<br/>and no lines cross.  The dots are named with a fraction<br/>denoting the _pitch_ in the _tuning_ that&apos;s being shown.<br/>In the above case, the tuning is [1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 45/32, 3/2,<br/>15/8].  I wrote those fractions with /&apos;s, to show that<br/>they are _pitches_.  Notice that I wrote the fractions in<br/>our list of consonant intervals with :&apos;s to show they are<br/>_intervals_.  That&apos;s a convention developed on this list,<br/>to keep intervals straight from pitches.  For example,<br/>starting at 3/2, we move a 5:4 to 15/8.  See?</p><p>Now say we wanted to add 15:8 to our list of consonances.<br/>We&apos;d add a dimension for 15, and then a step from 1/1 to<br/>15/8 would be a single line on our 15-axis, rather than<br/>two lines (one on the 3 and one on the 5).  See?</p><p>Note!<br/>&#x9;Now look at this Wilson diagram:<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal12.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal12.html</a></p><p>It depicts two structures in 6-factor tonespace (1 3 5 7 9 11).<br/>There appear to be lines crossing, but the lines only cross in<br/>2-D (on the paper).  The thing on the paper is only a shadow of<br/>a 6-dimensional object.  Cool, huh.</p><p>Anywho, the beat is that if we desire tunings with a good<br/>number of consonances for a good economy of tones, they look<br/>like connected structures in tonespace.  One type of very<br/>highly-connected structure is the tonality diamond (see<br/>Partch -- the figure on the right of the above diagram is<br/>the 11-limit diamond).  Another type is the Combination<br/>Product Set, or CPS.</p><p>To make a CPS tuning, start with your list of consonances, and<br/>take, say, two of them at a time, follow them out on the lattice,<br/>and mark a dot where you stop.  For example, taking our 11-limit<br/>consonance list: (1 3 5 7 9 11) two at-a-time, we get...</p><p>(1 3)   (3 5)   (5 7)  (7 9)  (9 11)<br/>(1 5)   (3 7)   (5 9)  (7 11)<br/>(1 7)   (3 9)   (5 11)<br/>(1 9)   (3 11)<br/>(1 11)</p><p>Order doesn&apos;t matter, since moving a 5:4 and then a 3:2 away<br/>from 1/1 gets us to 15/8 the same as moving a 3:2 and then a<br/>5:4.  You can see that all this moving amounts to multiplying<br/>the numbers.  So our pitches are...</p><p>3/2   15/8    35/32  63/32   99/64<br/>5/4   21/16   45/32  77/64<br/>7/4   27/16   55/32<br/>9/8   33/32<br/>11/8</p><p>Notice there&apos;s no 1/1!  All those pitches are measured from<br/>1/1, but it&apos;s not in the tuning itself.  That&apos;s one cool thing<br/>about CPSs -- they have no &quot;center&quot; tonality (unlike tonality<br/>diamonds).</p><p>Note also that while the numbers in these fractions are rather<br/>large, the tuning has a lot of low-numbered consonant relationships.</p><p>Lastly, note that we could have taken the factors three at<br/>a time (that would give the figure on the left of the Wilson<br/>diagram above), four at a time, etc.  One at a time gives a<br/>tuning the same as the consonant list; six at a time gives<br/>only one pitch.</p><p>You&apos;re ready to explore CPSs!</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=11086 href="#11086">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/7/2000 7:01:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;Be sure to see Paul Erlich&apos;s Gentle introduction to CPS!!<br/>&gt;&gt;It looks like he did a great job.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I&apos;m glad I did a great job, &apos;cause I haven&apos;t written it yet!</p><p>Whoa- I guess I was referring to the long post, which you recently<br/>posted a corrected version of.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=15623 href="#15623">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robert_walker@rcwalker.freeserve.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/2000 7:17:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>&gt;Partch, followed by Wilson, invented this whole language that we&apos;re<br/>&gt;speaking here.</p><p>Right, thanks, I look forward to reading his _Genesis of a Music_</p><p>Perhaps this may be helpful for anyone else interested in making the connection<br/>between the pascal diagram and the geometrical shapes as named by mathematicians<br/>- I have just today figured out how it works in mathematical terms.</p><p><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal16.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal16.html</a><br/>as explained in<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11031">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11031</a></p><p>=<br/>point</p><p>pt, triangle, triangle, pt</p><p>pt, tetrahedron, octahedron, pt<br/>Here one could show derivation of the hexany = octahedron by drawing a tetrahedron<br/>with vertices 1, 3, 5, 7 so 1*3 = midpoint of the line joining the 1 to the 3, etc.</p><p>pt, 4-simplex, truncated 4-simplex, truncated 4-simplex, 4-simplex, pt<br/>Here the truncated 4-simplex is obtained by putting points at the mid points of the edges<br/>of the 4-simplex with vertices 1, 3, 5, 7, 9  (or 1,3, 5, 7, 11)</p><p>pt, 5-simplex, truncated 5-simplex, 2D face centred dual of 5-simplex, truncated 5-simplex, 5-simplex, pt<br/>Here 2D face centred dual of 5-simplex = Eikosany as it has 10 vetrtices - also = two truncated<br/>4-simplexes  joined together</p><p>You can derive it from the 5-simplex with vertices 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (say) by putting points at<br/>the middle of each of its triangular faces, e.g. at 1*3*5, etc.</p><p>(this is last row in the diagram at <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/dal16.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/dal16.html</a>)</p><p>Next row would be<br/>pt, 6-simplex, truncated 6-simplex, 2D face centred dual of 6-simplex, 3D face centred dual of 6-simplex, 2D face<br/>centred dual of 6-simplex, truncated 6-simplex, 6-simplex, pt</p><p>You could derive the middle figure of this row from the 6-simplex by putting points at the middle<br/>of each of its tetrahedral 3-D faces, and joining them up.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=15636 href="#15636">ðŸ”—</a>David C Keenan &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>11/17/2000 3:20:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Robert Walker!</p><p>Thanks for your VRML dekanies with sound.
