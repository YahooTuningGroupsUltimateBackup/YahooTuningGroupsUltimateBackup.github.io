Meyer&apos;s _The Musician&apos;s Arithmetic_<br/>(_University of Missouri Studies, v 2 # 1; 1929).</p><p>Meyer&apos;s little book is an admirably clear<br/>exposition wherein he advocates the use of rational<br/>proportions for the notation of music, then<br/>&apos;somewhat disappointingly&apos; (says Partch) applies<br/>his theories to a &apos;quarter-tone&apos; keyboard instrument.</p><p>I have an important question regarding Meyer&apos;s work:<br/>did he actually tune his piano to 24-tET, or<br/>was his system simply using 24-tET as a basis<br/>for the notation and keyboard, with the pitches<br/>actually tuned in just-intonation?</p><p>I believe it was the latter, but don&apos;t have the book<br/>handy at the moment.</p><p>A large appendix at the end of Meyer&apos;s book is<br/>K. C. Hsiao&apos;s _Chinese Scale Theories_, an entertaining<br/>account which clearly provided Partch with most of<br/>the information about Chinese theory that he put into<br/>the historical sketches which make up Part 4 of _Genesis_.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
