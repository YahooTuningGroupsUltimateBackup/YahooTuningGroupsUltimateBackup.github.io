The reason I post this is that in the last few days,<br/>people have taken the time to write up lots of helpful explanations<br/>and do lots of math for me (Petr, Gene, etc) and I&apos;ve been slow to<br/>pick up on it. So sorry guys, will have to catch up on the latest<br/>comma pump developments when I get back.</p><p>Should there be any technical issues with the list (I was afraid the<br/>files section was going to burst any day now, although it looks like<br/>our data usage has somehow gone down...?) feel free to contact me<br/>offlist about it. Other than that, although I might post a quick<br/>comment here or there, I&apos;ll be gone for a bit.</p><p>I&apos;ve also been working on a 19-limit negri-based comma pump example in<br/>my spare time, so I might manage to finish that sometime soon, stay<br/>tuned.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=99526 href="#99526">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2011 10:13:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wed, May 25, 2011 at 1:10 PM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi all,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m trying to move to New York while simultaneously embarking on a<br/>&gt; caffeine-fueled rampage the likes of which this world has never before<br/>&gt; encountered.</p><p>You know, uh, this was supposed to be a caffeine-fueled &quot;coding&quot;<br/>rampage, signifying that I&apos;m trying to work from home as a programmer<br/>while moving to NYC. Do not fill in the blanks in your mind with<br/>regard to what kind of rampage I might have meant; this is a purely<br/>&quot;coding&quot; rampage. I&apos;m not just rampaging in general. That wouldn&apos;t be<br/>how I roll. -Mike</p></div>
