And most all of the original source scores,<br/>papers, and almost all of his original tape archives (i.e., what<br/>Harry still had with him when he died) are here in San Diego, with<br/>the exception of materials used to produce the &quot;Enclosures&quot; series.</p><p>Hope to see you in Feb, Gene!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
