Or do<br/>you know some better notator?<br/>And how do you compose with it? It&apos;s not algorithmic composition<br/>software (but there are some preprogrammed motifs or something like<br/>this, which I never used, why?).

How you<br/>can use it on the channel which is reserved to drum sets? Or are you<br/>satisfied with few timpani in orchestral drum set?<br/>In my XG instruments orchestral set is only PC 49 on drum channel<br/>(Bank Select = CC 00/32 must be 127/0). Timpani are PC 48 on melodic<br/>channel (for basic sound Bank Select is 0/0, for roll+hit 0/43).<br/>Don&apos;t you mix here the both numbers?</p><p>&gt; 11. Violins I<br/>&gt; 12.

Besides - call me old fashioned -<br/>I doubt such kind of programming has something to do with making<br/>music. Live real music is not a series of isolated events, it&apos;s a<br/>language with words, sentences, articles, meaning, words between the<br/>lines... It must speak, it must breathe... Here in Japan I have heard<br/>a lot of &quot;musicians&quot; playing only notes, not music...

AND, it is MIDI capable, so its use of any arbitrary MIDI message can be determined by the instrument designer. IOW, we don&apos;t have to wait, frustrated by hardware and software designers who don&apos;t care at all about tuning and microtonality: we can roll our own instruments. Let&apos;s say for example, we want to design a live real time adaptive tuning instrument, one that would allow us to choose between tuning table on the fly using for instance a breath controller or sostenuto pedal MIDI message--done, no problem. You can see the advantages, no? Nothing needs to be hard wired!</p><p>I&apos;m just wanting to point out that you shouldn&apos;t be unimpressed with CSound...it&apos;s all what you choose to do with it.

I<br/>&gt; &gt; also have a less-is-more approach to writing.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The only chance how to have something performed (once in ten<br/>&gt; years :-) ).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Since I do use quarter<br/>&gt; &gt; tones, third tones and whatnot, and it&apos;s not easy to find musicians<br/>&gt; &gt; trained to play and hear microtones, I like to keep things simple.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I also compose with Noteworthy Composer, a poor-man&apos;s Sibelius or<br/>&gt; &gt; Finale. It&apos;s always worked for me, but if I ever can afford it, I<br/>&gt; &gt; would<br/>&gt; &gt; like to try one of the more expensive programs.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Again I don&apos;t understand your points here. Sibelius is very good<br/>&gt; notation software, I wouldn&apos;t call it cheap, it&apos;s not so cheap.<br/>&gt; Features are satisfying, and output can be quite professional. Or do<br/>&gt; you know some better notator?<br/>&gt; And how do you compose with it? It&apos;s not algorithmic composition<br/>&gt; software (but there are some preprogrammed motifs or something like<br/>&gt; this, which I never used, why?). I use it only for making my scores.<br/>&gt; Of course there&apos;s a lot of limitations concerning contemporary music,<br/>&gt; very often I fight with it to get what I need, unfortunately with no<br/>&gt; success (even such trivial things like polytempo, polymetrics are<br/>&gt; impossible)... But I stopped from financial reasons at Version 3, now<br/>&gt; there&apos;s 6, at least I must find some time, visit their site and check<br/>&gt; what they added.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, this is how I assign the sixteen channels for MIDI mockups of<br/>&gt; &gt; symphonic works, microtonal or not (again, I&apos;m not so much a<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonal<br/>&gt; &gt; composer as I am a composer who uses microtones, and usually, but not<br/>&gt; &gt; always, 72-edo).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1. Flute and/or piccolo<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. Oboe and/or English horn<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 3. Clarinet<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Bassclarinet?<br/>&gt; &gt; 4. Bassoon<br/>&gt; &gt; 5. Horn I<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 6. Horn II or tuba<br/>&gt; &gt; 7. Trumpet (I often use Brass-61 for channels 7 and 8)<br/>&gt; &gt; 8. Trombone<br/>&gt; &gt; 9. Harp, piano, organ, celesta, glockenspiel, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; 10. Timpani and other orchestral percussion (drum kit 48 or 49)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Timpani are in GM/GS/XG/GM2 as melodic sound, not drum set. How you<br/>&gt; can use it on the channel which is reserved to drum sets? Or are you<br/>&gt; satisfied with few timpani in orchestral drum set?<br/>&gt; In my XG instruments orchestral set is only PC 49 on drum channel<br/>&gt; (Bank Select = CC 00/32 must be 127/0). Timpani are PC 48 on melodic<br/>&gt; channel (for basic sound Bank Select is 0/0, for roll+hit 0/43).<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t you mix here the both numbers?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 11. Violins I<br/>&gt; &gt; 12. Violins II<br/>&gt; &gt; 13. Violas I<br/>&gt; &gt; 14. Violas II<br/>&gt; &gt; 15. Cellos I<br/>&gt; &gt; 16. Cellos II and/or basses<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How do you combine cellos and basses on one channel? Just by octave<br/>&gt; doubling of cello sound?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ll also swap out channels if I need both flute and piccolo, oboe and<br/>&gt; &gt; English horn, and so on, but I might have to drop a horn or string<br/>&gt; &gt; part.<br/>&gt; &gt; (I don&apos;t need six channels for strings all that much, actually.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What about stereo panning? This is important for resulting stereo<br/>&gt; sound. And concerning reverb and other audioprocessing?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And how do you work with dynamics? Do you use CC 10 for absolute<br/>&gt; channel volume in the setup in the beginning of the composition, and<br/>&gt; CC 11 for relative expression during the composition?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Vibrato? Tremolo? Pizzicato strings? Muted brass or strings? Do you<br/>&gt; use also filter cutoff and resonance CC&apos;s? Attack/release CC&apos;s? NRPN<br/>&gt; controllers?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I also do microtones with pitch bends, old school.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; With which range?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That does cause<br/>&gt; &gt; problems with sound decay/release, of course.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Plus limited polyphony - you can play let&apos;s say two flutes on one<br/>&gt; MIDI channel, or four horns.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If I&apos;m writing complex<br/>&gt; &gt; microtonal parts in strings, for instance, I&apos;ll have channels 11-16<br/>&gt; &gt; all<br/>&gt; &gt; set as a generic string ensemble (48 or 49) and have each channel<br/>&gt; &gt; fixed<br/>&gt; &gt; 16.67 cents apart, like I did with &quot;The Waterloo Rag&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have used the same trick with my &quot;Ecmelic music 1&quot; in 72 EDO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My Roland synth<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which one exactly?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; does handle generic scale tuning messages which I can send with Scala,<br/>&gt; &gt; but of course, that&apos;s only limited to the twelve-note octave.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I still need to learn Csound or something when I have time, but I<br/>&gt; &gt; really<br/>&gt; &gt; don&apos;t. I feel like I&apos;m getting too old to learn whole new languages.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Same with me, it would be a loss of time. Results (at least what I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; heard) are not so convincing to me. Besides - call me old fashioned -<br/>&gt; I doubt such kind of programming has something to do with making<br/>&gt; music. Live real music is not a series of isolated events, it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; language with words, sentences, articles, meaning, words between the<br/>&gt; lines... It must speak, it must breathe... Here in Japan I have heard<br/>&gt; a lot of &quot;musicians&quot; playing only notes, not music... There IS<br/>&gt; definitely some difference.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe better to learn MAX/MSP, and buy more hardware or software<br/>&gt; synthesizers...<br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway, how do *you* all handle tuning large orchestral scores?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t need it until now. When I will need it, I will just retune<br/>&gt; my hardware synthesizers (every asks different approach) and use<br/>&gt; them. Same way like working with three instruments, just more<br/>&gt; instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I have simulated orchestra + pipe organ + 3 drum soloists for my<br/>&gt; &quot;Double concerto for organ and drums&quot; in 2005, I used these maximal<br/>&gt; number of MIDI channels:<br/>&gt; 12 for woodwinds<br/>&gt; 10 for brass<br/>&gt; 47 for drums and percussions (4 players in orchestra + 3 soloists<br/>&gt; used 116 different instruments)<br/>&gt; 10 for pipe organ<br/>&gt; 20 for strings<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s 99 MIDI channels. I don&apos;t think I will ever need more for<br/>&gt; orchestral work.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forr&oacute;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ~D.<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://ludwigvan-tx.livejournal.com">http://ludwigvan-tx.livejournal.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Wier/">http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Wier/</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=84474 href="#84474">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forr&#xF3; &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2009 9:04:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Aaron, for explanation, I will try to study more about CSound, such possibilities sound interesting.

Timpani and other orchestral percussion (drum kit 48 or 49)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Timpani are in GM/GS/XG/GM2 as melodic sound, not drum set. How you<br/>&gt; &gt; can use it on the channel which is reserved to drum sets? Or are you<br/>&gt; &gt; satisfied with few timpani in orchestral drum set?<br/>&gt; &gt; In my XG instruments orchestral set is only PC 49 on drum channel<br/>&gt; &gt; (Bank Select = CC 00/32 must be 127/0). Timpani are PC 48 on melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; channel (for basic sound Bank Select is 0/0, for roll+hit 0/43).<br/>&gt; &gt; Don&apos;t you mix here the both numbers?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 11. Violins I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 12. Violins II<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 13. Violas I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 14. Violas II<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 15. Cellos I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 16. Cellos II and/or basses<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How do you combine cellos and basses on one channel? Just by octave<br/>&gt; &gt; doubling of cello sound?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ll also swap out channels if I need both flute and piccolo, oboe and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; English horn, and so on, but I might have to drop a horn or string<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; part.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (I don&apos;t need six channels for strings all that much, actually.)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What about stereo panning? This is important for resulting stereo<br/>&gt; &gt; sound. And concerning reverb and other audioprocessing?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And how do you work with dynamics? Do you use CC 10 for absolute<br/>&gt; &gt; channel volume in the setup in the beginning of the composition, and<br/>&gt; &gt; CC 11 for relative expression during the composition?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Vibrato? Tremolo? Pizzicato strings? Muted brass or strings? Do you<br/>&gt; &gt; use also filter cutoff and resonance CC&apos;s? Attack/release CC&apos;s? NRPN<br/>&gt; &gt; controllers?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I also do microtones with pitch bends, old school.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; With which range?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That does cause<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; problems with sound decay/release, of course.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Plus limited polyphony - you can play let&apos;s say two flutes on one<br/>&gt; &gt; MIDI channel, or four horns.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If I&apos;m writing complex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; microtonal parts in strings, for instance, I&apos;ll have channels 11-16<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; set as a generic string ensemble (48 or 49) and have each channel<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fixed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 16.67 cents apart, like I did with &quot;The Waterloo Rag&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have used the same trick with my &quot;Ecmelic music 1&quot; in 72 EDO.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; My Roland synth<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Which one exactly?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; does handle generic scale tuning messages which I can send with Scala,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but of course, that&apos;s only limited to the twelve-note octave.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I still need to learn Csound or something when I have time, but I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; really<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; don&apos;t. I feel like I&apos;m getting too old to learn whole new languages.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Same with me, it would be a loss of time. Results (at least what I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; heard) are not so convincing to me. Besides - call me old fashioned -<br/>&gt; &gt; I doubt such kind of programming has something to do with making<br/>&gt; &gt; music. Live real music is not a series of isolated events, it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &gt; language with words, sentences, articles, meaning, words between the<br/>&gt; &gt; lines... It must speak, it must breathe... Here in Japan I have heard<br/>&gt; &gt; a lot of &quot;musicians&quot; playing only notes, not music... There IS<br/>&gt; &gt; definitely some difference.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Maybe better to learn MAX/MSP, and buy more hardware or software<br/>&gt; &gt; synthesizers...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, how do *you* all handle tuning large orchestral scores?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I didn&apos;t need it until now. When I will need it, I will just retune<br/>&gt; &gt; my hardware synthesizers (every asks different approach) and use<br/>&gt; &gt; them. Same way like working with three instruments, just more<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When I have simulated orchestra + pipe organ + 3 drum soloists for my<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Double concerto for organ and drums&quot; in 2005, I used these maximal<br/>&gt; &gt; number of MIDI channels:<br/>&gt; &gt; 12 for woodwinds<br/>&gt; &gt; 10 for brass<br/>&gt; &gt; 47 for drums and percussions (4 players in orchestra + 3 soloists<br/>&gt; &gt; used 116 different instruments)<br/>&gt; &gt; 10 for pipe organ<br/>&gt; &gt; 20 for strings<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s 99 MIDI channels. I don&apos;t think I will ever need more for<br/>&gt; &gt; orchestral work.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Daniel Forr&oacute;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ~D.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://ludwigvan-tx.livejournal.com">http://ludwigvan-tx.livejournal.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Wier/">http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Wier/</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=84600 href="#84600">ðŸ”—</a>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2009 12:38:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel, sorry for procrastinating again--I appreciate your reply (you too, Torsten). And I can&apos;t get my e-mail program to work right with the quotes, so I&apos;ll have to answer them at the top.</p><p>First, what I do is write scores in Noteworthy and play them back with it using my Roland, then record from the Roland back to the computer using the line-in/microphone input with Audacity. The format is MIDI, using GM/GS and additional sounds; my keyboard also has sounds for bouzouki, nay, qanun, oud and Arabic/Turkish drums, which I use in a few compositions. I have to jury-rig a few things, like when I have to record more than 16 channels (the Roland only has that many) or more than two drum kits, I make two sound recordings with metronome clicks at the beginning and mix them together. Whatever works. (Noteworthy can actually handle 16 synths for a total of 256 channels, and I can use a soft synth with a single file that has more than 16 tracks, but I don&apos;t use softsynths right now.)</p><p>Second, I might need Finale and Sibelius in the future to make better scores (Noteworthy isn&apos;t that great for score setting), or write it in Lilypond, the hard way. Third, the Orchestral drum kit includes thirteen chromatic notes of timpani from F1 to F2, so unless I need notes outside that range or timpani chords outside of 12-et, then I can put timpani and percussion in channel 10, with a second timpani channel in channel 9 if necessary.</p><p>Fourth, I often use a generic string section sound so cellos and basses could be on the same channel... but I&apos;ve recently decided to reorganize my string section. The new string section is as follows: violin I, violin II, viola, a &quot;modern viola da gamba&quot; (a small cello tuned an octave lower than violin), violoncello and contrabass. If I can ever afford pro-quality virtual instruments (and a computer with the CPU speed and memory to handle them), then I&apos;d have violin, viola, cello etc. sections, and things would be better organized.</p><p>Anyway, thanks again, and I&apos;ll take your advice; I didn&apos;t quite answer all your questions. I think what I&apos;m doing now will work just fine, but you never know...</p><p>~D.</p><p>----- Original Message ----- From: &quot;Daniel Forro&quot; &lt;dan.for@...&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Tuesday, 25 August, 2009 09:47<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] MIDI scoring: how I do it</p><p>Very interesting message!</p><p>There&apos;s nothing wrong with MIDI and working with it, I&apos;ve been<br/>working the same way since 1985. I don&apos;t use virtual synthesizers or<br/>samplers. Partly because I don&apos;t need them (I have enough hardware),<br/>partly because my best computer was born in 2002 and it would be<br/>rather impolite to ask more output from him :-)</p><p>On 25 Aug 2009, at 9:43 PM, Danny Wier wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is sort of shameless self-promotion, but there&apos;s a question in<br/>&gt; all<br/>&gt; this somewhere.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I know I&apos;m using dinosaur technology, but I do compose in MIDI.<br/>&gt;</p><p>What do you mean? MIDI is a communication protocol for remote<br/>controlling MIDI devices, how can you compose in it?<br/>I compose usually in the head and at the table, and record the score<br/>track by track in real time into the software MIDI sequencer, later<br/>adding lot of controllers which couldn&apos;t be recorded directly<br/>together with music. Another working method is totally free or<br/>partially controlled improvisation, again in real time, track by<br/>track with prepared sounds on different MIDI channels. Or something<br/>in between.<br/>&gt; That means I only get 15 instrument channels and one for percussion.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MIDI world is not so much limited and restricted, everything depends<br/>on hardware (or nowadays also software synthesizers or samplers).<br/>What you write is valid for 1 MIDI output port, but your computer can<br/>control more independent MIDI output ports, every with 16 channels. I<br/>have now in my studio access to 864 MIDI channels, and my recent gear<br/>can play simultaneously about 360 of them. Rest must wait for future<br/>acquisitions :-)<br/>Nothing to say about a possibility to control virtual instruments<br/>directly from sequencer.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s actually an intentional self-handicap; after all, constraints<br/>&gt; make<br/>&gt; for stronger artistic expression.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Nothing than agreement. Intentional limitation can stimulate<br/>creativity. I have a chapter in my books on MIDI how to work<br/>creatively even with GM standard only. I have used my knowledge few<br/>years ago when programming music for mobile phones...</p><p>&gt; (Of course I could, and have,<br/>&gt; sequenced music in two MIDI files and recorded one over the other, in<br/>&gt; case I wanted more instruments or two different drum sets.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Why so complex way? I suppose you can record 32 tracks simultaneously<br/>in your sequencer, then synchronize it with external audiorecording<br/>(or computer) and record two stereo layers, first time MIDI 1-16<br/>channels (17-32 muted), second time channels 17-32 (1-16 muted).<br/>If you need more drum sets simultaneously, in many tone generators<br/>it&apos;s possible to select drum set on any channel, not only on default 10.<br/>&gt; Because of current amplification technology--the &iuml;&iquest;&half;berhuge late<br/>&gt; Romantic-early 20th century symphony orchestra is no longer really<br/>&gt; needed,<br/>&gt;</p><p>I agree, that museum setup died 100 years ago and is good only for<br/>historical music (until Mahler/Strauss or so). What we need for<br/>contemporary music is better balanced instrumental group (maybe even<br/>with the help of amplification for some instruments), with additional<br/>instruments, like early music, plucked, ethnic, of course drums and<br/>percussions, AND synthesizers and samplers as organic part (for<br/>emulation of rare instruments and new electronic sounds).</p><p>&gt; I score things for a smaller orchestra, almost chamber size. I<br/>&gt; also have a less-is-more approach to writing.<br/>&gt;</p><p>The only chance how to have something performed (once in ten<br/>years :-) ).</p><p>&gt; Since I do use quarter<br/>&gt; tones, third tones and whatnot, and it&apos;s not easy to find musicians<br/>&gt; trained to play and hear microtones, I like to keep things simple.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also compose with Noteworthy Composer, a poor-man&apos;s Sibelius or<br/>&gt; Finale. It&apos;s always worked for me, but if I ever can afford it, I<br/>&gt; would<br/>&gt; like to try one of the more expensive programs.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>Again I don&apos;t understand your points here. Sibelius is very good<br/>notation software, I wouldn&apos;t call it cheap, it&apos;s not so cheap.<br/>Features are satisfying, and output can be quite professional. Or do<br/>you know some better notator?<br/>And how do you compose with it? It&apos;s not algorithmic composition<br/>software (but there are some preprogrammed motifs or something like<br/>this, which I never used, why?). I use it only for making my scores.<br/>Of course there&apos;s a lot of limitations concerning contemporary music,<br/>very often I fight with it to get what I need, unfortunately with no<br/>success (even such trivial things like polytempo, polymetrics are<br/>impossible)... But I stopped from financial reasons at Version 3, now<br/>there&apos;s 6, at least I must find some time, visit their site and check<br/>what they added.</p><p>&gt; Anyway, this is how I assign the sixteen channels for MIDI mockups of<br/>&gt; symphonic works, microtonal or not (again, I&apos;m not so much a<br/>&gt; microtonal<br/>&gt; composer as I am a composer who uses microtones, and usually, but not<br/>&gt; always, 72-edo).<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; 1.
