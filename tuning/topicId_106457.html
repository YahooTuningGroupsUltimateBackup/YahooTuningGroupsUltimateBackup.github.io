Meckenheuser&apos;s German is even more obtuse than Werckmeister&apos;s, and a good translation would be difficult, so anyone who wants to can try for themselves. It&apos;s &sect;38, page 37. He&apos;s talking about tempering the thirds, and keeps saying that in comparing many different chords, one must strive for &quot;einerlei Schwebung&quot; (Schwebung = tempering, aberration). Towards the end of the paragraph, he mentions that even though the &quot;Tremores&quot; (trembling) will be different, the result will be &quot;einerlei Schwebung&quot;, i.e. identical tempering.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3><a id=106464 href="#106464">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Francis &#x3C;Francis@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2015 5:16:29 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul</p><p>In &sect;76, at the bottom of page 53 continuing onto page 54, Meckenheuser writes:</p><p>Wenn wird denn die gleichschwebende Temperatur (Terminus absurdus) in die Welt kommen?</p><p>My question is why is the terminology absurd?

Meckenheuser&apos;s rejection of the terminology probably has to do with the use of the words Schweben/Schwebung(en). In its common historical usage stretching back to Old High German, schweben has nothing whatsoever to do with sound. There IS a good reason to explain why organ builders adopted it to refer to the sound produced by two slowly-beating organ pipes which has to do with psycho-acoustics, but that is too complex to explain here, and in any case, as part of my as-yet unpublished exhaustive study of the history of the use of the word, I&rsquo;d rather keep it for later.</p><p>Recall that Praetorius had also voice his disapproval of the term, but said that it was so common among organ builders that it would be impossible to do away with it, and he would therefore begrudgingly use it as well, provided he could add the distinctions of &ldquo;&uuml;ber sich&rdquo; and &ldquo;unter sich&rdquo;. So he also might have called it &ldquo;Terminus absurdus&rdquo; had it he felt a Latin itch.</p><p>Even in the 19th century, after the original meaning of schweben (more on that in a moment) had become blurred to the point where it did indeed often mean &ldquo;beating&rdquo;, Scheibler forcefully rejected it from his earliest work (1834) as &ldquo;unpassend&rdquo; and used Sto&szlig; instead. The scientific literature immediately began to heed his advice, and we find a sudden and wide-spread adoption of the word Sto&szlig;. And it would have stayed that way, had Helmholtz not revived the term. But he may well have had something else in mind as well, concentrating not so much on the nature of the perceived sound as the underlying physical cause, i.e. the drifting phase relationship of the 2 wave forms, which adheres well to one the original proper meanings of the &ldquo;schweben&rdquo; which means to drift or float slowly.</p><p>In any event, it is almost beyond the realm of credibility to think that Meckenheuser was referring to a situation in which &ldquo;gleichschwebende once [at some earlier time?] carried a connotation of equal beating&rdquo;. The phrase &ldquo;gleichschwebend&rdquo; seems to have been coined by Neidhardt in his 1706 Beste und Leichteste Temperatur des Monochordi. If you have read Neidhardt, you will know that he consistently used both the verb schweben and noun Schwebung exclusively to refer to the degree of tempering in a proportional mathematical sense in all three of his publications (1706, 1724, and 1732), and that he always quantified schweben/Schwebung using units of 1/12th of the Pythagorean comma. So it is hard to believe that the term could have morphed from its original meaning in only 21 years.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p><p>---In <a href="mailto:TUNING@yahoogroups.com">TUNING@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;Francis@...&gt; wrote :</p><p> Paul</p><p> In &sect;76, at the bottom of page 53 continuing onto page 54, Meckenheuser writes:</p><p> Wenn wird denn die gleichschwebende Temperatur (Terminus absurdus) in die Welt kommen?</p><p> My question is why is the terminology absurd?

So does Praetorius, but he also found it bad. But how does Meckenheuser use it? If you can find a passage where he does not mean the proportional degree by which an interval is tempered, then please do so.</p><p>RE: your argument that Praetorius is only talking about scheben &quot;in the context of tuning by fourths&quot; is simply not true. The section begins by him giving the three rules, the third of with is that the FIFTHS should be tuned &quot;schwebend&quot;. He then mentions that one can also tune by fourths. He then goes on to describe what schweben means. Half way through his commentary we find this:</p><p>Dann schweben soll so viel heissen wie unrein, das ist, entweder zu hoch oder zu niedrig gestimmet; sie derivirens aber daher: wann man in den Orgeln, sonderlich die Octaven, Quinten und Quarten einziehen und stimmen will, so schwebt der Resonanz und Klang in den Pfeiffen und schl&auml;gt gleich eim Trentt&auml;ant etliche Schl&auml;ge: Je n&auml;her man es aber mit dem einstimmen zur Reinigkeit und accort bringt, je mehr verliert sich die Schwebung allm&auml;hlich und werden der Schl&auml;ge immer weniger, bis so lang, dass die Octava oder andere concordanten recht eintreten.</p><p>So he is talking about &quot;concords&quot;, and &quot;especially the octave, fifth and fourth&quot;.</p><p>You&apos;re right about Neidhardt and the syntonic comma. Never noticed that little detail before. Interesting, he like Werckmeister and Bendeler, just use &quot;the comma&quot;, brushing aside the difference between the Pythagorean and the synotonic. Thanks for pointing that out.</p><p>RE: North. What he says doesn&apos;t reflect upon German literature nor upon German practice as best as we can glean from the literature. Nor does it offer us any indications as to what Germans meant when they used the words schweben and Schwebung as opposed to Tremoris, Bebung, or Schl&auml;ge.</p><p>Basically, we can cut all this discussion of this or that passage in isolation by cutting straight to the very heart of the matter. To wit: is there anywhere any single shred of evidence that historically people thought that identically tempered intervals manifested equal beat rates? This is so counter-empirical that lacking any evidence, I think we can discount it completely. As far as I know, this whole idea was created out of whole cloth by Owen Jorgenson. If you have any evidence to the contrary, please let us know!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>P</p><p>---In <a href="mailto:TUNING@yahoogroups.com">TUNING@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;Francis@...&gt; wrote :</p><p> Paul</p><p> Meckenheuser used the term Schweben elsewhere, so he can&rsquo;t have considered it absurd or he would have avoided it.
