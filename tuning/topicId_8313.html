It&apos;s about time someone introduced some good old fashioned<br/>&gt;&gt;honest pessimism here.<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;&gt;Actually, Dave, I&apos;ve been milking the hell out of sustaining dramatic<br/>&gt;&gt;suspense. However, we have been dwelling too long on mere conflict. Your<br/>&gt;&gt;contribution is most timely in that it provides a desperately needed element<br/>&gt;&gt;of CRISIS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hee hee! Thanks for a good chuckle, Jerry.</p><p>Glad you enjoyed it, Dave. Thanks for being a great &quot;straight man.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; My money<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; is on that they are not making any significant shift when the fifth is<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; introduced (say less than 2 cents), it just sounds that way.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Perhaps. We have considered that the effect may be a perceptual illusion.<br/>&gt;&gt;Just in case, however, how much money did you have in mind?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The conversion of such a small amount between Australian and US dollars<br/>&gt; would be a pain. But I promise to be real nice to you if I&apos;m wrong. Like<br/>&gt; explain some microtonal mathematics of your choice, in detail with coloured<br/>&gt; diagrams. :-)</p><p>Thanks much, but I plan to beat it out of here just as soon as I have taken<br/>advantage of the wisdom packed into this place to help solve the mystery of<br/>the &quot;high third&quot; The more I learn here the more I tend to become addicted,<br/>and I really can&apos;t allow that to happen. I need to get back to my writing<br/>and publishing, and dropping in here everyday for the last month has really<br/>cut into that. I do plan to stay in touch with folks by means of web sites<br/>and email, however. And when I get to Australia (we&apos;ve been trying for<br/>years) I&apos;ll expect you to throw another shrimp on the barbie.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Gerald Eskelin, TD 518.22]<br/>&gt;&gt;Wow! What a great contribution, Dave. I&apos;ve been referring to the 6:7 third<br/>&gt;&gt;in my music theory classes as the &quot;dinky third,&quot; and that really has no<br/>&gt;&gt;class at all. The term &quot;subminor third&quot; will allow me to regain my dignity<br/>&gt;&gt;as a very cool professor of music.  Many thanks.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow! A chance to influence a real professor of music.</p><p>No big deal. My freshman students do that everyday. They don&apos;t know it but<br/>they teach me much more than I teach them. One reason I&apos;m reluctant to<br/>retire is that they are my source of &quot;raw&quot; input--hence my intention to<br/>&quot;use&quot; them next week for the &quot;high third&quot; demo.</p><p>&gt; Then you need the<br/>&gt; following list. It&apos;s essentially a translation and extension of the system<br/>&gt; of a Dutch guy named Adriaan D. Fokker who, by the way, also coauthored a<br/>&gt; paper on Relativity with Albert Einstein.</p><p>Wow! Now _that&apos;s_ what I call name dropping.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ratio  Name<br/>&gt; ----------------------------<br/>&gt; 11:12 narrow neutral second<br/>&gt; 10:11 neutral second<br/>&gt; 9:10 narrow major second<br/>&gt; 8:9 major second<br/>&gt; 7:8 supermajor second<br/>&gt; 6:7 subminor third<br/>&gt; 5:6 minor third<br/>&gt; 9:11 neutral third<br/>&gt; 4:5 major third<br/>&gt; 7:9 supermajor third<br/>&gt; 3:4 perfect fourth<br/>&gt; 8:11 super fourth<br/>&gt; 5:7 augmented fourth<br/>&gt; 7:10 diminished fifth</p><p>Aren&apos;t these last two backward? The 5:7 tritone is smaller than the 7:10<br/>tritone, thus the 5:7 &quot;contracts&quot; (E-Bb) in resolution (diminished fifth)<br/>and the 7:10 (E-A#) expands in resolution (augmented fourth). Remember, Paul<br/>and Joe hold that &quot;context is everything.&quot; (You don&apos;t suppose Mr. Fokker<br/>would reconsider these, do you? Too late, you say? Okay. Do you suppose he&apos;d<br/>mind if we messed with it a bit?)</p><p>But then I suppose he was considering that the 5:7 ratio is mathematically<br/>closer to the 3:4 ratio--thus a variety of &quot;fourth.&quot; (I guess he never read<br/>Piston.) It is comforting at times to note that even the smartest among us<br/>don&apos;t know everything--except for Paul, of course. :-)</p><p>&gt; 2:3 perfect fifth<br/>&gt; 7:11 subminor sixth<br/>&gt; 5:8 minor sixth<br/>&gt; 8:13 neutral sixth<br/>&gt; 3:5 major sixth<br/>&gt; 7:12 supermajor sixth<br/>&gt; 4:7 subminor seventh<br/>&gt; 5:9 wide minor seventh<br/>&gt; 6:11 neutral seventh<br/>&gt; 1:2 perfect octave<br/>&gt; 5:11 neutral ninth<br/>&gt; 4:9 major ninth<br/>&gt; 3:7 subminor tenth<br/>&gt; 5:12 minor tenth<br/>&gt; 2:5 major tenth<br/>&gt; 3:8 perfect eleventh<br/>&gt; 4:11 super eleventh<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See <a href="http://dkeenan.com/Music/IntervalNaming.htm">http://dkeenan.com/Music/IntervalNaming.htm</a> for more<br/>&gt; explanation (than you probably want).</p><p>I really could have used this info when I wrote &quot;Lies My Music Teacher Told<br/>Me.&quot; Perhaps when we do the next [ fifth :-) ] printing I can do some<br/>editing.</p><p>Thanks again for your &quot;ass whipping&quot; and for this very helpful terminology.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
