It would be great if<br/>&gt; the Kronos Quartet should take this quartet in their repertoire, I think<br/>&gt; they would have success with it. Surely they&apos;d perform it with more<br/>&gt; flair and intensity than in this live recording. Anybody knows how to<br/>&gt; make them interested?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Manuel Op de Coul    <a href="mailto:coul@ezh.nl">coul@ezh.nl</a></p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3>MANUEL.OP.DE.COUL@EZH.NL</h3><span>7/5/2000 9:06:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig,</p><p>That string quartet uses harmonics until the 18th. I don&apos;t know<br/>which piece for two violins. I only know the third violin sonata<br/>which is on the CD.
