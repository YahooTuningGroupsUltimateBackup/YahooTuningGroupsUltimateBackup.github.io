This is an idea that<br/>interests me particularly because it accounts for a large portion of the<br/>world&apos;s scales if it is in fact the case.  Even improper scales such as the<br/>pelog type scale you mention are usually derived from fifth cycles (ie are<br/>subsets of a diatonic or some such scale).  I say all this allowing some<br/>intonational margin in what I would call a fifth.  Accually, my original<br/>idea may be wrong because, as I have been looking closer at this point I<br/>find that slightly flat fifths work better as generators than more<br/>acoustically correct fifths.  Wilson&apos;s attractive method of showing how the<br/>various intervals generate scales pointed out to me that the fact that<br/>certain intervals generate good scales in Rothenberg&apos;s sense after fewer<br/>repetitions than others depends in a regular way upon the rough amount of<br/>the octave which that interval takes up, and that the best always seem to<br/>be those in the vicinity of the fifth.</p><p>You said:</p><p>&gt;Wilson also explain very basic bedrock<br/>&gt;scales that are omitted in Rothenbergs case such as the pentatonics formed<br/>out of the<br/>&gt;diatonics. That it includes such scales as f a b c e.  That these exist<br/>historically cannot be<br/>&gt;overlooked. Another problem with the Rothenberg (out of just being not<br/>understandable to the<br/>&gt;average musician) is those scales which he thinks are of importance like<br/>the whole tone (and<br/>&gt;the other symmetrical scales shows) have had limited historical use. His<br/>aim is close but<br/>&gt;misses.</p><p>&#x9;I don&apos;t agree that Rothenberg overlooks historical impromper scales.  In<br/>fact, he has a lot to say about them, in particular about the Indonesian<br/>Pelog scale and ragas based on improper scales.  I don&apos;t think his system<br/>should be interpreted a la Balzano as placing a value judgement on scales,<br/>where proper scales are judged as better.  The model is explainatory; it<br/>says that proper scales imply a certain style of music for which improper<br/>scales would be inappropriate, and it explains certain stylistic features<br/>of musics using improper scales.  The fact that a body of music exists<br/>(albeit small in perspective) in which composers grappled with the problems<br/>of symmetrical scales is interesting in the applicability of his model to<br/>the style which those composers developped.  The implication is definitely<br/>not to favor those scales as musical material.<br/>&#x9;I agree with you, though, that R.&apos;s work unfortunately isn&apos;t<br/>understandable to the average musician.  I feel this is more a matter of<br/>presentation: the average musician hasn&apos;t read the principia mathematica.<br/>However, the concepts involved, I believe, are intimately and uniquely<br/>understood by musicians.</p><p>jason</p></div><h3><a id=11230 href="#11230">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2000 8:18:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;This is an idea that interests me particularly because it accounts for a<br/>&gt;large portion of the world&apos;s scales if it is in fact the case.</p><p>I think we can explain this by the highly-consonant nature of the 3/2,<br/>the fact that it occurs early in the harmonic series, etc.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t agree that Rothenberg overlooks historical impromper scales.

These pairs include the minor third to perfect<br/>fourth, the major second to minor third, the minor second to major<br/>second, and the chromatic semitone to minor second. We can calculate<br/>the size of the golden fifth exactly using the fact that two perfect<br/>fourths plus a major second equals an octave:</p><p>2*x + x*phi^2 = 1 octave</p><p>x=1/(2+phi^2) octave</p><p>which is approximately .419821 octave, or 503.786 cents.

Phi is (sqrt(5)-1)/2, so you<br/>can either think of the generator as phi octaves, or 1200*phi cents,<br/>or<br/>as a frequency ratio of 2^phi.</p></div><h3><a id=11265 href="#11265">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2000 2:51:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To further clarify:</p><p>Phi = 1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1...... = 0.618...</p><p>In general, any real number can be expressed (uniquely, with some<br/>minor<br/>proviso that I forget) as a continued fraction of the form</p><p>a+1/(b+1/(c+1/(d+1/(e+1/(f+1/(g+1/(h+1/......</p><p>where a, b, c, etc., are whole numbers. In our case, a is zero, since<br/>we&apos;re interested in fractions of an octave.</p><p>To see the points where you get an MOS scale (which is often a proper<br/>scale) from a given generator, you truncate the expansion at each<br/>instance of a &quot;+&quot;, and see what fraction you get.</p><p>i.e:</p><p>1/1 = 1<br/>1/(1+1/1) = 1/2<br/>1/(1+1/(1+1/1)) = 1/(1+1/2) = 1/(3/2) = 2/3<br/>1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/1))) = 1/(1+2/3) = 1/(5/3) = 3/5<br/>1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/1)))) = 1/(1+3/5) = 1/(8/5) = 5/8<br/>1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/1))))) = 1/(1+5/8) = 1/(13/8) = 8/13<br/>1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/1)))))) = 1/(1+8/13) = 1/(21/13) = 13/<br/>21</p><p>Since these fractions tell you approximately what fraction of an<br/>octave<br/>the generator is, the denominators tell you how many times you have<br/>to<br/>stack the generator upon itself before an additional stacking takes<br/>you<br/>very close to your starting point, i.e., how many notes are in the<br/>MOS<br/>scale. So the phi-part-of-an-octave generator gives you MOS scales<br/>with<br/>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 21 notes.</p><p>The golden fourth is also a proportion of an octave whose continued<br/>fraction expansion ends in all 1s, i.e., a noble number. Let&apos;s call<br/>it<br/>K for Kornerup. It is</p><p>K = 1/(2+1/(2+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1...... = 0.4198...</p><p>Its convergents are</p><p>1/2 = 1/2<br/>1/(2+1/2) = 1/(5/2) = 2/5<br/>1/(2+1/(2+1/1)) = 1/(2+1/3) = 1/(7/3) = 3/7<br/>1/(2+1/(2+1/(1+1/1))) = 1/(2+1/(2+1/2)) = 1/(2+2/5) = 1/(12/5) = 5/12</p><p>and (leaving out the calculations) the next ones are 8/19, 13/31, 21/<br/>50, 34/81, etc., giving the Yasser/Kornerup sequence of scales: 2, 5,<br/>7, 12, 19, 31, 50, 81.</p><p>I was wrong when I said, a few minutes ago, that this series was not<br/>shown on the scale tree. Look at <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/ST07.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/ST07.html</a>.<br/>Here we see that the noble number that we derived as the size of the<br/>golden fourth in octaves, 1/(2+phi^2) = .41982112717, is the<br/>generator<br/>of the series of MOS scales that zigzags in the tree around the<br/>dashed<br/>line that originates between 2/5 and 3/7.</p><p>Note that K can also be written as 1/(2+1/(2+phi)).</p><p>Now, in case you thought that good generators like these had to be in<br/>the vicinity of the fifth or fourth, let&apos;s look at another noble<br/>number.</p><p>1/(1+1/(2+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1...... = 1/(1+1/(2+phi)) =<br/>.7236067977</p><p>This generator is 1200*(.7236067977) = 868.33 cents, clearly a<br/>&quot;sixth&quot;<br/>and not a &quot;fifth&quot;. Calculating the convergents of this scale:</p><p>1/1 = 1<br/>1/(1+1/2) = 1/(3/2) = 2/3<br/>1/(1+1/(2+1/1)) = 1/(1+1/3) = 1/(4/3) = 3/4</p><p>Continuing the calculation, or following the scale tree, the next<br/>convergents are 5/7, 8/11, 13/18, 21/29, 34/47, 55/76, 89/123,<br/>indicating MOSs with 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123. I believe<br/>all<br/>these scales are proper -- you may want to check, though.</p><p>The question as to which generator is &quot;best&quot; in your sense is a<br/>difficult one, Jason, since all noble numbers share the property that<br/>the ratio of the size of the denominator of one convergent to the<br/>size<br/>of the denominator of the next convergent rapidly approaches phi as<br/>you<br/>go farther and farther out into the expansion. So with enough notes,<br/>any noble number (of which there are an infinite number in any finite<br/>range) will eventually get you a sequence of MOS scales where the<br/>number of notes increases by a factor of 1/phi [= phi+1] from one<br/>scale<br/>to the next. Also, the new notes do the best possible job of avoiding<br/>existing notes, as the steps in one scale are divided into two<br/>smaller<br/>steps, whose sizes are in the proportion 1:phi [= phi:(1-phi)] to one<br/>another.</p><p>However, you may be more interested in the first few MOS scales you<br/>get<br/>than in the behavior of MOS scales out toward infinity. Observe that<br/>the last property I mentioned, dividing existing steps in the<br/>proportion 1:phi, starts happening at the point in the process of<br/>taking convergents where the rest of the continued fraction expansion<br/>contains all 1s. Since that happens right away with the &quot;2^phi&quot; or<br/>phi-<br/>of-an-octave generator, it would seem that this generator best<br/>captures<br/>the property you&apos;re after. I know that you are interested in<br/>propriety;<br/>I leave it as an exercise for you to catalogue the first few proper<br/>scales that each of these generators generates, and let me know how<br/>they compare. My bets are on the the phi-of-an-octave generator.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid this generator, and the scales it produces, do not agree<br/>with what we observe in scales around the world. In fact I&apos;m unaware<br/>of<br/>any music that uses this generator and any of the Fibonacci series of<br/>MOSs that it produces.</p></div>
