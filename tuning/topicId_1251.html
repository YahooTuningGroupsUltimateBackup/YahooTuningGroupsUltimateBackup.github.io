Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com">PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com</a>&gt; replied:</p><p>&gt;You betcha! That&apos;s Barlow&apos;s Indigestibility Function! You can read<br/>&gt;about it in Georg Hajdu&apos;s paper, to which you provide a link from your<br/>&gt;own web page. Hajdu doesn&apos;t go into the justification for Barlow&apos;s<br/>&gt;function, and I find odd-limit to be much more reliable.</p><p>Thanks for that. Barlow/Shepard&apos;s Indigestibility does not allow a choice<br/>of weights for the different prime exponents (my k_p&apos;s). It just says</p><p>k_p = (p-1)^2/p</p><p>note that this is roughly proportional to p like my proposed approximation<br/>to prime limit. So it&apos;s another logarithmic complexity measure. And indeed<br/>Barlows Indigestibility is almost a constant times the prime limit. It<br/>seems to rank the numbers in the same order anyway. No wonder you don&apos;t<br/>like it Paul.</p><p>So Barlow&apos;s is yet another that I can approximate by a choice of weights.</p><p>&gt;([your web page] seems inaccesible these days -- is it offline?)</p><p>Shouldn&apos;t be. I moved some stuff into a subdirectory (but I thought I left<br/>a redirection in place). What URL did you use? You can get to my equal<br/>temperaments article now from <a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/</a></p><p>George Hadju&apos;s paper is at<br/><a href="http://www.uni-muenster.de/Musikhochschule/Dozenten/Hajdu/Articles/LowEnergy">http://www.uni-muenster.de/Musikhochschule/Dozenten/Hajdu/Articles/LowEnergy</a><br/>.pdf</p><p>&gt;&gt;Maybe even determined the factors by experiment?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Why don&apos;t you propose one?</p><p>I guess the main thing would be to ask many people to rank various<br/>intervals by perceived consonance. Surely this has been done. Can someone<br/>report some results?

And also integer limit and now Barlow&apos;s Indigestibility.</p><p>&gt;What *exactly* is the cost factor measuring?</p><p>Excellent question. I&apos;ve switched to referring to them as &quot;prime exponent<br/>weights&quot; now. I suppose they represent something about how the human brain<br/>processes combinations of tones. The relative importance human evolution<br/>gas given to the various primes. I don&apos;t see why we should expect them to<br/>be any simple smooth function of the primes themselves as in Barlow&apos;s<br/>indigestibility or my approximation to prime-limits. But nor would I expect<br/>them to be equal (as in integer limit) or leap suddenly from zero to 1<br/>between 2 and 3 (as in odd limit). I *would* however expect it never to<br/>decrease with increasing prime (as with all these proposals).</p><p>&gt;Why is it significant that the natural logarithm<br/>&gt;is involved? (Forgive my mathematical ignorance)</p><p>Not significant. Any log base would do, and then change a multiplicative<br/>factor. But note that although there is no simple function to generate<br/>primes, their distribution is approximately logarithmic. The higher you go,<br/>the further apart they are. The nth prime is somewhere around e^n (I think).</p><p>&gt;Why do you choose to call this operation<br/>&gt;&quot;musical complexity&quot;?</p><p>Well it just seemed like a kind of complexity that relates to musical<br/>consonnance. But indigestibility is good too. I couldn&apos;t think of anything<br/>else at the time that hadn&apos;t already been used (or has it?). Give me a<br/>better term.</p><p>&gt;What exactly are your<br/>&gt;spreadsheet charts explaining?</p><p>It was intended to let you try different weights (&quot;cost factors&quot;) for the<br/>prime exponents and then look at the chart to see it it ranks various numbers.</p><p>9 seems to be the main bone of contention. Integer and odd limits rank it<br/>as more complex than 7. They give too much weight to 3. Prime limit and<br/>Barlow&apos;s indigestibility rank it as less complex than 5. They give 3 too<br/>little weight. I personally would like to put 9&apos;s complexity *between*<br/>those of 5 and 7. What do you think? That&apos;s why I chose my weights as I did<br/>(0.3, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.0, ...).</p><p>I&apos;ve updated the spreadsheet to include Barlows indigestibility for<br/>comparison. And to show both linear complexity (for comparison to integer<br/>and odd) and log complexity (for comparison to prime and Barlow).</p><p><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/MusicalComplexity.xls">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/MusicalComplexity.xls</a></p><p>Regards,</p><p>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=1320 href="#1320">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph L Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/5/1999 9:52:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Monzo:]<br/>&gt; What *exactly* is the cost factor measuring?</p><p>[Keenan:]<br/>&gt; Excellent question.

I&apos;ve already concluded<br/>regarding the study of meters that we break all meters<br/>down into simpler and simpler subdivisions, until<br/>ultimately everything can be expressed by combinations<br/>of 2s and 3s.</p><p>A simple example: 4/4 is a group of two 2s:<br/>4 = [ 2 x 2].</p><p>A complex example: I wrote a tune in 14/8<br/>subdivided as follows: 14 = 2 x 7.  The first<br/>group of 7 is subdivided into 4 [= 2 x 2] + 3,<br/>the second into 3  +  [2 x 2], forming a<br/>symmetrical pattern of accents for each bar.</p><p>I&apos;ve long thought that probably something<br/>like this was at work in our harmonic perception<br/>of pitch.  I allude to it in the last chapter of<br/>my book, but was afraid to say anything really<br/>detailed about it, as I had no way to quantify it.</p><p>With your original approximated weights<br/>(0.3, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.0, ...), which I thought were<br/>OK at first, it&apos;s evident that there is a sharp<br/>increase in complexity after 2.  Perhaps with<br/>a different weighting your formula is a mathematical<br/>validation and explanation of my idea.</p><p>I&apos;m certain that our difficulty of understanding<br/>more complex meters as anything but 2s and 3s<br/>has a lot to do with &quot;The relative importance human<br/>evolution has given to the various primes&quot;.  We<br/>can comprehend 1, 2 or 3 of anything *right away*,<br/>and from my knowledge of how evolution works,<br/>speed of recognition or comprehension ranks<br/>near the top of the list of importance.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Why do you choose to call this operation<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;musical complexity&quot;?</p><p>&gt; Well it just seemed like a kind of complexity that<br/>&gt; relates to musical consonnance.

What do you think?<br/>&gt; That&apos;s why I chose my weights as I did<br/>&gt; (0.3, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.0, ...).</p><p>It&apos;s always been my feeling that the main problem<br/>with my prime-limit idea was that 9 should be<br/>ranked higher in some way than 3.  And after<br/>trying a few other possibilities in your spreadsheet,<br/>I&apos;d thought that you gave too much emphasis to 2.<br/>I gave it a weight of as low as .05 before it looked<br/>like something I agreed with, but the weight of 3<br/>was much lower also - I don&apos;t remember what now.</p><p>As I said above, my inclination would be to have<br/>low weights for 2 and 3 and then increase sharply<br/>after that.  What do you think?  How about the<br/>question of 15?

Presumably Joe<br/>means &quot;on top of a major triad&quot;. Looking at the odd limits, a 15/8 forms<br/>a 3-limit interval, a 5-limit interval, and a 15-limit interval with<br/>notes of the major triad. A 7/4 forms a 7-limit interval, a 7-limit<br/>interval, and a 7-limit interval. So on the basis of odd limit alone,<br/>you could argue that a dominant seventh chord could &quot;resolve&quot; to a major<br/>seventh chord because two intervals become more consonant while one<br/>becomes more dissonant.</p><p>This is an example of what I was talking to Dante Rosati about -- people<br/>think about prime limit because they&apos;re tacitly assuming the presence of<br/>other notes. When you really break it down, odd limit works better.</p><p>A 15/8 alone vs. a 7/4 alone?
