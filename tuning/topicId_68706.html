If you want you can check them.</p><p>To test these files on myself I have associated each one to a random letter (&apos;solution&apos; folder). Then I putted in another  folder all the files keeping in the name just the letter (&apos;test&apos; folder). In this way I have tried to rank them without knowing what inversion and what chord I was listening. After this I checked the &apos;solutions&apos;.</p><p>Actually I have not finished my test since the differences was really too small...! The only certain thing to me is that 4-tET sounds very different from all the others and that I prefer 15:18:21:25, then 10:12:14:17 and then all the others.</p><p>I would purpose just to test what is the best chord (in smoothness) instead of trying to rank all the 25 chords!</p><p>ciao</p><p>lorenzo</p></div>
