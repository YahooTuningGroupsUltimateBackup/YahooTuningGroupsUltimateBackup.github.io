The impact that the statement<br/>had on me was that it helped bring into my awareness the motivations that<br/>lay behind my interest in music and microtonalily.  I don&apos;t believe he was<br/>judgeing or critisizing new ideas in music, but was offering an opportunity<br/>for self examination.</p><p>The outcome for me was a reexamination of my priorities, to see what was<br/>important, so that I could devote time to the first stage of composition --<br/>discovering what it was that I wanted to right about, and unlocking the<br/>creative potential to express something in music.</p><p>Still not on vacation,<br/>Darren<br/>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Joseph Pehrson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:josephpehrson@compuserve.com">josephpehrson@compuserve.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@onelist.com">tuning@onelist.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Wednesday, February 02, 2000 9:56 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Meaningless little treasures in mean tone</p><p>&gt; From: Joseph Pehrson &lt;<a href="mailto:josephpehrson@compuserve.com">josephpehrson@compuserve.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The remarks by our on-line &quot;educator&quot; are really not worthy of too much<br/>&gt; comment, in my opinion.
