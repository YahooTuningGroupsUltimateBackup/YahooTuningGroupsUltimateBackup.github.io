To say that the music of Beethoven, Schubert<br/>&gt;et al requires equal sizes of steps goes too far.</p><p>Going too far?  I think he is wandering in the tall weeds.  I propose that<br/>using 12 ET for Beethoven, Schubert, etc. strips one of the more important<br/>aspects out of the music.  You may as well try to recreate a Van Gogh<br/>painting with black and white paint!<br/>   Isacoff&apos;s book has a major shortcoming,(to me) in that it totally misses<br/>the temperament&apos;s effect on piano composition as the instrument developed<br/>(1700-1850).  He may be one of those that actually cannot hear the<br/>differences unless they are as great as those between 1/4 C and ET.  I still<br/>haven&apos;t seen anything that would suggest that ET was in widespread use before<br/>1900.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote RPT<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/11/2002 8:31:22 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., a440a@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/35519">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/35519</a></p><p>&gt;    Isacoff&apos;s book has a major shortcoming,(to me) in that it<br/>totally misses<br/>&gt; the temperament&apos;s effect on piano composition as the instrument<br/>developed<br/>&gt; (1700-1850).
