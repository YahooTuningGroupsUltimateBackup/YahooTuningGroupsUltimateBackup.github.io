It was played on a unique 1/16th piano (if there is two of<br/>them).  I know about McGill I would have been accepted there if I had not<br/>cancelled my inscription... but I&apos;m not really sure I want to live in<br/>Montreal.  I know that city (it&apos;s only 1h30 from where I was born ;-)</p><p>There is Denys Bouliane who&apos;s teaching there.  Anyways, for now I&apos;m not sure<br/>if I want to continue on with pure traditional compoisition or if I wouldn&apos;t<br/>be better to study in Electroaccoustique...?!  At the conservatory of Montreal<br/>someone said to me that they offer both programs combined... seems interesting<br/>too... but I must see if I find any suitable teacher... :-)</p><p>Thanks for all the information :-)</p><p>Vincent-Olivier Gagnon.</p><p>jon wild wrote:</p><p>&gt; From: jon wild &lt;<a href="mailto:wild@fas.harvard.edu">wild@fas.harvard.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John Gzowski wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Bruce Mather may teach somewhere in Montreal, but I don&apos;t know much<br/>&gt; &gt; about him other than that he has written some quarter tone and 16th tone<br/>&gt; &gt; pieces.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; those would be &apos;6th-tone&apos;, not 16th-tone... Bruce teaches at McGill in<br/>&gt; Montreal, and I studied there with him a few years ago. He has been a<br/>&gt; champion of Wyschnegradsky&apos;s music for a long time, and premiered many of<br/>&gt; his quarter- and 6th-tone pieces. My favourite microtonal piece by Mather<br/>&gt; himself is for four pianos (8 hands) in quarter-tones plus four<br/>&gt; ondes-martenot. sorry, can&apos;t remember what it&apos;s called.  There are a<br/>&gt; couple of recordings put out by McGill Records of his 1/4-tone stuff,<br/>&gt; played by him and his wife Pierrette, and his 1/6th-tone stuff on 3<br/>&gt; pianos. You can probably find out through the McGill music website,<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca">http://www.music.mcgill.ca</a>.  Mather also uses a lot of quarter-tones in<br/>&gt; his recent chamber opera, &quot;La Princesse Blanche&quot;. By the way, there are<br/>&gt; some other fine composers who teach at McGill, notably Brian Cherney. It&apos;s<br/>&gt; a great school, and a wonderful city, to be a musician in.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; cheers - Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; Start a new hobby.
