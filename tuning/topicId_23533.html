Bob&apos;s tasteful (tasty?) arrangement of _Autumn Leaves_<br/>&gt; follows well-established jazz procedures.</p><p>Maybe psuedo-tasteful-psuedo-arrangement... I just wrote<br/>down voicings I might play on guitar accompanying<br/>a solo voice.</p><p>All your points about leaving fifths out in<br/>jazz voicings are on target : fifths generally don&apos;t DO<br/>anything except thicken the texture, the root, third and<br/>seventh provide all the functionality. For texture<br/>thickening, you would prefer to use other, more colorful<br/>tones.</p><p>I did go to your website and, &quot;golly&quot;... I&apos;ll try to<br/>give those examples a spin (though I still seem to be<br/>internet audio impaired).</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
