It&apos;s far simpler and more<br/>logical.</p><p>HOWEVER, it is clear that 72-tET, the &quot;Long Island Princess&quot; of<br/>scales [it has everything] does it all!</p><p>I was particularly impressed with Paul Erlich&apos;s charts which showed<br/>several of the Just Intonation intervals possible in a half-octave of<br/>72-tET...  And, of course, 72-tET is one of our favorite &quot;bikes&quot; with<br/>12-tET chains transposible by prime factors...</p><p>For me, any writing in Just Intonation, certainly for PERFORMERS will<br/>proceed from that basis, if not the usual cents notation that I have<br/>been using....</p><p>I believe some SUBSETS of 72-tET which I could use if I were to use a<br/>conventional Halberstadt keyboard in my work would be of great<br/>value...</p><p>Thanks again to everyone who has helped with this valuable learning<br/>experience!</p><p>________ _____ _ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
