Obviously with<br/>an automated method of performance, whether a mechanical &quot;player<br/>archicembalo&quot; with rolls or an electronic arrangement such as some MIDI<br/>system using sequencer input, this complication should no longer be a<br/>problem.</p><p>In this tuning, the 19 notes of the first or regular keyboard are tuned in<br/>1/4-comma meantone (very close to 31-tet), Gb-A#. Then the 17 or 19 notes<br/>of the second keyboard -- Vicentino wanted 19, or 38 for the whole<br/>instrument, but settled for 17 (36 in all) because of technical problems<br/>-- are tuned in pure fifths with the first 19.</p><p>On Vicentino&apos;s 36-note instrument, there will be two notes on the lower<br/>keyboard with only tempered meantone fifths rather than pure ones -- B#<br/>and E#, as I recall. A 38-note instrument solves this problem, and<br/>obviously a modern electronic implementation could go to 62 notes for a<br/>complete 31-note meantone plus pure fifths above every step.</p><p>Thus Vicentino-style adaptive JI -- putting aside the B#/E# question on<br/>his 36-note instrument -- means pure vertical fifths everywhere.</p><p>The melodic intervals are based on meantone, requiring a melodic<br/>adjustment of 1/4 syntonic comma (~5.38 cents) to cope with syntonic comma<br/>shifts.</p><p>As has been pointed out, diesis shifts (e.g. G# vs. Ab) are a different<br/>problem if one seeking a 19th-century equivalence between these notes --<br/>or opportunity, if one wishes to use Vicentino&apos;s enharmonic (fifthtone)<br/>style with dieses as deliberate intervals, and at the same time to enjoy<br/>vertical JI.</p><p>Vicentino&apos;s JI tuning should not be confused with his 31-note division of<br/>the octave, where 31 notes of the 36-note or 38-note instrument are used<br/>to make a near-equal division of the octave into fifthtones, with the<br/>remaining 5 or 7 notes used to provide a _few_ just fifths. In the<br/>adaptive JI tuning for his instrument, we have only 19 basic pitches, with<br/>pure fifths supplied consistently (apart from E# and B#).</p><p>Again, especially in an automated performance, one can get the best of<br/>both systems by using 62 notes -- 31 basic notes (like his first tuning)<br/>each with its pure fifth (like his second tuning).</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=8420 href="#8420">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/10/2000 7:45:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo, thanks for the concise explanation of Vicentino&apos;s<br/>tuning scheme!
