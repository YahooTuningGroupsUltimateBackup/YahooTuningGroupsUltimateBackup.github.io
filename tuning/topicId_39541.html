It is<br/>followed by the American Luthiers Guild statement about how that organization<br/>believes that only Equal Temperament is possible and desirable.</p><p>As I often have at one of my piano tuning customer&apos;s homes today, I also<br/>tuned the guitar the way I have been now for 10 years and as usual, I saw the<br/>eyes open wide and a smile come upon the face along with comments about how<br/>the sound was much sweeter.</p><p>After that, I promised the customer that I&apos;d have that information up on my<br/>website later today, as I&apos;ve been intending to do for a while.</p><p>All comments and opinions are welcome.</p><p>Bill Bremmer RPT<br/>Madison, Wisconsin<br/>&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.billbremmer.com/">http://www.billbremmer.com/</a>&quot;&gt;Click here: -=w w w . b i l l b r e m m e r . c o m =-&lt;/A&gt;</p></div>
