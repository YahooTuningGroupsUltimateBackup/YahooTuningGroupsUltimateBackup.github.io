Will you be making use of Bebung?</p><p>Recently when I was in a record store, bemoaning the dearth of recordings of<br/>Bach harpsichord music *on the harpsichord*--and the comparative wealth of<br/>recordings of these works on the piano (let&apos;s face it--Bach didn&apos;t own a<br/>darned piano, and he only played on one a couple times toward the end of his<br/>life), it dawned on me that someone needs to release a CD featuring 19th<br/>century piano music played on the harpsichord....it would make such a wryly<br/>subversive critique of the whole &quot;Bach on a concert grand&quot; thing.  Of<br/>course, the clavichord might be an even better choice, since that instrument<br/>is at least capable of dynamics.  The challenge then is merely to find<br/>pieces that don&apos;t exceed the range of the instrument...well, AND to make the<br/>music come off convincingly.  :&gt;  Are you going to have to take any notes in<br/>the Chopin works up or down an octave?</p><p>Dale Scott</p></div><h3><a id=5393 href="#5393">ðŸ”—</a>Judith Conrad &#x3C;jconrad@xxxxxxx.xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/10/1999 11:59:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Sat, 9 Oct 1999, Dale Scott wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt;From: Judith Conrad &lt;<a href="mailto:jconrad@sunspot.tiac.net">jconrad@sunspot.tiac.net</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I am giving a highly experimental<br/>&gt; &gt;solo concert a week from tomorrow, entirely music of Frederic Chopin in<br/>&gt; &gt;temperament ordinaire, but that&apos;s not the really experimental part, the<br/>&gt; &gt;really experimental part is that it&apos;s on a 5-octave unfretted clavichord,<br/>&gt; &gt;an instrument that was pretty obsolete by 1810, the year Chopin was born.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a very cool idea, Judy!  Will you be making use of Bebung?</p><p>It is intuitively obvious that I will be making extensive use of Bebung,<br/>which is the finger vibrato you can produce on a clavichord unlike any<br/>other keyboard. Funny thing is I&apos;m getting a fair amount of criticism from<br/>the early music world for doing this -- some of them have such a sense<br/>that 19th century music is evil and the enemy, they don&apos;t even want to<br/>listen. The divide between music that can be attempted on the clavichord<br/>and music that shouldn&apos;t, in my estimation, is music that is written for<br/>in-house and small salon performing could be suitable, music written for a<br/>concert hall isn&apos;t. But much of the early music world really wants the ego<br/>trip from performing in large halls...</p><p>Yes, I&apos;m doing quite a bit of moving around up and down octaves, which<br/>doesn&apos;t sound a wrong as it might because the overtone structure of a<br/>clavichord is so very different from a piano one doesn&apos;t even always<br/>notice.</p><p>Info on location happily furnished on request -- and there&apos;a party<br/>afterwards.</p><p>Judy</p></div><h3><a id=5394 href="#5394">ðŸ”—</a>Dale Scott &#x3C;adelscott@xxxx.xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>Invalid Date Invalid Date</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;From: Judith Conrad &lt;<a href="mailto:jconrad@sunspot.tiac.net">jconrad@sunspot.tiac.net</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;It is intuitively obvious that</p><p>Judy, I would have read this post, but when I saw how it began, I<br/>automatically deleted it.  ;&gt;</p><p>Dale</p></div><h3><a id=5407 href="#5407">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rmcgowan@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/1999 10:09:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;really experimental part is that it&apos;s on a 5-octave unfretted clavichord,<br/>&gt;an instrument that was pretty obsolete by 1810, the year Chopin was born.</p><p>Judith, I must be missing something or at least not understanding...
