<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>Tuning invitation</h1><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2001 5:46:34 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Several list members have sent me MIDI files from time to time for<br/>retuning, and I&apos;d like to issue a more general invitation to everyone<br/>on the list.  If it should happen that I get swamped, I might have to<br/>cut back, but any given file is very easy for me to process, and the<br/>flow so far has been tiny.</p><p>My program is now able to handle both single-voice MIDI and multi-voice<br/>MIDI (though very rich sequences may overflow the channels and drop<br/>notes; the program tells me how many).  All are expected to adhere to<br/>the General MIDI standard, with its reserved drum channel and voicing<br/>(program) conventions.  I combine tuning with any existing pitch bends<br/>used for gliss, but the default bend range of +/- 2 semitones must be<br/>adhered to or else it&apos;ll sound awful!</p><p>I&apos;m assuming that the results will be put to non-commercial use, but if<br/>not, we&apos;ll talk! :-)</p><p>It&apos;s best if file names have no spaces and are reasonably short.  Send&apos;m<br/>to jdl&quot;at&quot;<a href="http://adaptune.com">adaptune.com</a> and let me know what limit(s) you would like to<br/>hear (5, 7, and/or 11/13).</p><p>If I particularly like a sequence, I might ask for permission to share<br/>it with others on the list, but won&apos;t do so unless it&apos;s ok.  My results<br/>may be shared on your own web pages if it&apos;s free and you give me tuning<br/>credit.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
