I should have said that I was only thinking of<br/>using<br/>each of the six intervals once in the string, so there would only<br/>need to<br/>be 6 contour choices, hence the 2 to the 6th power total possible<br/>contour orderings per 6-interval string.</p><p>&gt; &gt; so what I wanted to do was to find a bare minimum standard or<br/>&gt; &gt; reference contour choice ordering that would have the minimum<br/>&gt; &gt; stylistic &quot;expression&quot;, and the maximum stylistic neutrality.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was interested in concentraing on the other melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; variables: (1) interval content, (2) interval order as melodic<br/>&gt; &gt; generators and pitch class as the resulting scales embodied in<br/>&gt; &gt; the melodies.<br/>&gt; //<br/>&gt; &gt; I just used a simple graphic technique of &quot;zooming out&quot; from<br/>&gt; &gt; the first 2-place ordering (DA), and then making that the first<br/>&gt; &gt; place item in the next order of magnitude (DA-AD), and repeating<br/>&gt; &gt; that on every order of magnitude (2,4,8,16,...etc.).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I hope this helps, Carl! :) If not, fire away some more<br/>&gt; &gt; questions! :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m still not sure I could produce a string of Ds and As of<br/>&gt; any length according to your procedure.</p><p>Sure. Each successive order of magnitude doubles the length of the<br/>contour choice string. You add the opposite ordering or inversion to<br/>whatever length of string you start with.</p><p>&gt; Can you give some examples of increasing lengths?</p><p>Sure. Here&apos;s one to 64 places (I&apos;ve put dashes every 4 places and<br/>underscores every 16 places, so you can see the patterns easier).<br/>Also note that the 2nd row is the reverse or inversion of the first<br/>row. This holds true at all orders of magnitude that are powers of 2:</p><p>ADDA-DAAD-DAAD-ADDA_DAAD-ADDA-ADDA-DAAD_<br/>DAAD-ADDA-ADDA-DAAD_ADDA-DAAD-DAAD-ADDA</p><p>&gt; Also, this shows only how to get the interval directions.  It<br/>&gt; does not show how to choose the intervals.  Correct?</p><p>Right. That&apos;s up to the user. But contour is NOT tuning-system-<br/>specific,<br/>so the algorithm can be used either to generate 12TET<br/>melodies/subscales<br/>OR to create non-12TET just or other froms of tunings. I&apos;m only<br/>interested<br/>in just intervals right now, but I don&apos;t see why the algorithm<br/>couldn&apos;t<br/>be used for non-just microtonal intervals, too.</p><p>Thanks very much for the response and interest! :)</p><p>Bill Flavell</p></div>
