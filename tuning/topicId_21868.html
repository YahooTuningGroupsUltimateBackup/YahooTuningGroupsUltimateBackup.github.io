They were ideas I wanted to<br/>communicate for some time, but I was in an passionate and<br/>emotional state, trying to express my feelings, when I<br/>posted and I can see that those emotions were the tidal<br/>wave on which my post rode, with the point I was making a<br/>mere piece of seaweed, floating tiny and unnoticed.</p><p>In particular I want to apologize for using an actual post<br/>of another list member (whose work I respect) as a<br/>launching pad for what I was saying. I believe my ideas<br/>would have been much more effectively communicated if I<br/>had kept them general, with no loss in content. I regret<br/>that I inappropriately made them personal and I humbly<br/>apologize for this.</p><p>As a brief and hopefully unemotional summary of my ideas<br/>let me offer the following:</p><p>I believe it is not constructive and harms our interest in<br/>the furtherence of music and art when we hold the belief<br/>that we are entitled to the work of others without<br/>compensation. I believe that the destructiveness of this<br/>idea is a demonstrable fact and that its truth is even<br/>seen in nature. It is reflected in the way in which<br/>livestock, soil, and relationships move towards death when<br/>energy is always taken but never renewed.</p><p>I hope that that clarifies what I was saying and I am very<br/>sorry that persons were hurt and offended because I was<br/>unable to appropriately convey it the first time I tried.</p><p>I would also like to clear up a possible misunderstanding.</p><p>I publically responded to a post directing me to<br/>information about the open source movement by making<br/>comments that were completely inappropriate and totally<br/>off topic and had no place whatsoever on this tuning<br/>forum. I accept that it was completely inappropriate for<br/>me to do so. At most, I should have responded privately<br/>with my thoughts. To the extent they are out there, I hope<br/>you will allow me to clarify what I was saying as I know<br/>that some people may reasonably infer into what I said<br/>things that I did not intend.</p><p>I understand that Mr. R. of the movement identifies<br/>himself as a neopaganist, though I identify him as a<br/>satanist. His writings are featured on web sites that<br/>clearly identify themselves as satanist.</p><p>I have had pagans as friends and currently even have a<br/>couple of family members who are pagans. My understanding<br/>of paganism is that it seeks to honor ancient religions<br/>and that it teaches respect for all life, for the earth,<br/>the environment, and creation, for animals, and for other<br/>people. &quot;First Do No Harm&quot; is one of their key tenets,<br/>which is a value I respect, especially as it relates to an<br/>attempt to improve the earth and lift people up rather<br/>than take advantage of or oppress them.</p><p>I believe that even my belief in the dignity of work and<br/>the need of people to be compensated fairly and not taken<br/>advantage of is consistent with this. I do not find that<br/>Mr. R&apos;s beliefs are consistent with true paganism, but<br/>rather the opposite. Especially to the extent that he has<br/>asserted his support for the elimination of large classes<br/>of people simply because of their beliefs. I find his<br/>position to be thoroughly evil and destructive. A good<br/>summary of his own beliefs is found in his own quote which<br/>he claims to be a neopagan motto, &quot;Steal from any source<br/>that doesn&apos;t run too fast.&quot; I think this clarifies what<br/>his open source movement is about, a belief in evolution,<br/>that the natural order is for the strong to hunt down and<br/>destroy the weak in order for progress to occur. I do not<br/>agree with this philosophy in any way and am instead<br/>aligned with the opposite, that we should protect the<br/>weak, the defenseless, and the oppressed. My beliefs are<br/>indeed completely contrary to those held by an evolution<br/>based system of nature belief.</p><p>Fortunately, many modern pagans and others do not think<br/>this way. All those who respect life and creation and love<br/>are friends of mine and are welcome to stop by and say<br/>hello. To those who hate these things I only ask that they<br/>evaluate carefully whether their beliefs are truly making<br/>the world a better place or are actually destructive.</p><p>I know there is often a wide chasm between belief and<br/>action, which we all are subject to, and that all we can<br/>do is try to close this gap. Sometimes we fail. I am not<br/>perfect and I am not better than any of you, and I am not<br/>less valuable either. We all have intrinsic value. Again<br/>this relates back to my belief in compensation for work.<br/>Unwillingness to compensate others for work they have done<br/>from which you benefit is a great dishonor to them, and is<br/>ultimately self-destructive, in my humble opinion. This<br/>applies not just to software, but to musicians who create<br/>albums, and to artists and authors and the field hands who<br/>pick the food we eat.</p><p>I understand that some emotions were running just as high<br/>as mine and that some people said things to me in that<br/>state. I do not hold any of these things against anyone. I<br/>forgive those who have offended me, just as I ask<br/>forgiveness for the offense I have caused you.</p><p>May Adonai keep you and bless you and protect you.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=88328 href="#88328">ðŸ”—</a>john777music &#x3C;jfos777@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2010 2:04:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I discovered an incongruity with the calculator which rates 33/16 as good when it&apos;s clearly bad.
