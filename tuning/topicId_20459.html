They are the second half of the Chapter 22, and the beginning of the Chap. 23, that he calls &quot;The Last Chapter&quot;, of the Book One.<br/>I have tried to translate as literally as possible; I hope it is clear enough.</p><p>begin translation (the first part of the Chap.22 talks about compound intervals)<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>.......<br/>So, who is the man who doesn&apos;t know how, because of the new system introduced in today&apos;s music, the ancient one was changed, and those three Greek genera, Diatonic, Chromatic, and Enharmonic, with their tetrachords, are decayed? from which it derived, that many intervals in the music, consisting of their own rational proportions, rather are founded on ear&apos;s judgment, than on that of the reason. And what? , maybe someone will oppose, So nowadays&apos; music, lacking of sure, never fallacious principles, and just relying on the misleading judgment of the ear, will be undeserving the name of science. To which I reply, that this does not compromise the dignity, and the infallibility of our Music at all. As if to the one, and to the other of the major and minor tones, to the one, and the other, of the major and minor semitones, and to some intervals likewise minor, to each of them in particular one still poses its own clef, which many expert Musicians, both ancient and modern, showed with their various kinds of clefs, which they invented, as of today one would surely have all of the usual intervals, chiefly according to the division of Ptolemy, consisting in their rational proportions. Having then known, that the use of different clefs is full of difficulties, and still desiring to put a remedy to the scarcity of intervals, being applied to the amplification [multiplication] of them, and to gain the imperfect consonances, they tried to divide the tone, and the semitone in two equal parts. But since they discovered, that this could not be made by the numbers only, they called the judgment of the ear for help, taking away from one interval a certain, almost imperceptible quantity, and adding it to the other, by which operation, having put away the difficulty of the position of the clefs, they managed in such a way that our Music, from the shortage of intervals, as escaping from the prison, today can widely run through the vast field of modulation: but the Composers, and the Organists should maintain themselves within the limits of the reason, so that because of ignorance, and avidity for transporting, going out of the right path, they wouldn&apos;t go too licentiously wandering through the chromatic intervals, especially in the organ. Should that happen, it could hardly be avoided, that instead of a pleasant, and agreeable concert, a highly harsh and unpleasant howl wouldn&apos;t come to hurt the ear. Then, I have no doubt, that all that has been added to the Music, in utility and splendor, and how much praiseworthy the first Author is (whose glory is rightly ascribed to the ancient philosopher Aristoxenus) is well known to whoever has even a light dye of Music. Although those things, that I will say below, rather appear to belong to the second Book, that is to the practice, nevertheless, in order to begin the following Book immediately with the lessons to be prescribed, I judged it more opportune to put them at the end of this one.</p><p>THE LAST CHAPTER</p><p>About today&apos;s system of Music.</p><p>I informed above how, taken away the disparity of the tones, and semitones, the three Greek genera were abolished, and it will be useful to have it remembered: because from it, of necessity, a different system has been introduced, and those three genera were narrowed to two, that is the Diatonic, and the Chromatic, which substituted the Greek ones, and which now I will present in the following express range:</p><p>[three rows of pentagram follow, showing the diatonic scale, three octaves from C to c&apos;&apos; (C to e in the tenor clef, f to e&apos; in the soprano clef, f&apos; to c&apos;&apos; in the violin clef), and the chromatic scale, the same compass and notation. The chromatic notes are all represented as sharps of the preceding diatonic note]</p><p>Although the insatiable cupidity of the man has been satisfied, always ready to the variety, and novelty around the use of the one, and the other of those genera, the Composers have been used to employ them untidily in their Compositions, so that nowadays the mixed genus is in use, which (because in everything one must adapt to his times) I don&apos;t condemn, nevertheless the Composers be warned, that in this mixed genus, in the a cappella compositions that are used to be sung, they don&apos;t use the Organ; otherwise they can be sure, that they will never reach the craved aim. As nothing else can serve to this style, then the pure Diatonic genus: and, based on the long practice I have for the long use, and experience, I wish that everybody had this very important warning to hearth. Now, assumed the equality of the Tones, and Semitones, let us go to the intervals, that are in use today, beginning with<br/>About the Unison<br/>........</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>(a description of the intervals follows) end translation</p><p>Some comments.<br/>By the flowery language of his times, Fux appears to state two main things, as far as I have understood it:<br/>first, the equal or at least circular tuning was well known and fairly widely spread at his time, and,<br/>second, the organs were still tuned by some sort of unequal temperament. It cannot be understood here whether organs were tuned that way because they still carried their original tuning, as possibly they were built before the diffusion of ET, or they were still built and tuned with some sort of non-circulating temperament at Fux&apos;s times.</p><p>Further comments?</p><p>Regards<br/>Leonardo</p></div><h3><a id=47110 href="#47110">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2003 11:30:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Leonardo Perretti &lt;dombedos@t...&gt;</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20459.html#47107">/tuning/topicId_20459.html#47107</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Further comments?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards<br/>&gt; Leonardo</p><p>***Thanks so much for this research.

Not to mention that fretted<br/>instruments ike gambas are scaled to ET.</p><p>&gt; and, second, the organs were still tuned by some sort of unequal<br/>&gt; temperament. It cannot be understood here whether organs were tuned<br/>&gt; that way because they still carried their original tuning, as<br/>&gt; possibly they were built before the diffusion of ET, or they were<br/>&gt; still built and tuned with some sort of non-circulating temperament<br/>&gt; at Fux&apos;s times.</p><p>Yes, organs are in a class by themselves for practical reasons, when<br/>considering tuning and temperament...We know that organs in particular had a<br/>tradition of being tuned to meantone, and because a large pipe organ had so<br/>many ranks, a well-temperament like Werkmeister would work well to shorten<br/>the labor of switching from meantone to well-temperament, because only a few<br/>notes would be altered in the bearing from meantone; indeed, Werkmeister&apos;s<br/>temperament was a practical tuning for organs, not a baroque-wide tuning for<br/>all instruments, as is commonly misuunderstood, and not even considered a<br/>great tuning by Werkmeister himself--again, he was being practical.</p><p> (BTW, Kirnbergers&apos; tuning was also considered of low-quality by and large by<br/>the musicians of the time-and it is. It&apos;s 20th-century early-music success is<br/>partly due to encyclopedia entries, etc., and the Korg electronic tuners.<br/>Tunings similar to Neidhardts were considered better alternatives by<br/>contemporary commentators, and rough variations of this were probably the<br/>basic idea of where the 18th century harpsichord/pianoforte/clavichord<br/>mindset was......)</p><p>We forget that the harpsichord is what we are really talking about when we<br/>thinkabout these tunings....strings bend freely, and like singers use a<br/>quasi-just intonation when playing by themselves; winds are scaled to a<br/>temperament, but flexible; and fretted instruments have been theoretically ET<br/>for a long time....that is, fixed fretted instruments.</p><p>-Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=47115 href="#47115">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron K.

The rest is useless<br/>sophistry. It&apos;s all about delighting the ear, no? To the past generations as<br/>much as to us....why wouldn&apos;t they use a more &apos;rich tuning&apos; like Neidhardt<br/>when they had a choice (i.e., they weren&apos;t on an organ)</p><p>&gt; And Werckmeister was instrumental (pardon the pun) in<br/>&gt; bringing other instruments into the church to make music with the organ.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I follow what you mean.....</p><p>&gt; Also, what makes you think Werckmeister self-deprecates his circular<br/>&gt; chromatic temperaments?  I haven&apos;t seen anything of this kind anywhere and<br/>&gt; I am on the look out.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I was mistakenly giving the wrong impression. Not some much<br/>&apos;self-deprication&apos;, but a healthy sense of what works in a given practical<br/>setting, and what is best, even if it&apos;s not &apos;your own tuning&apos;....plus, there<br/>was a common practice tuning that defied specific mathematical description,<br/>i.e., one used one&apos;s ears and &apos;guess-timated&apos;. In other words, no one &apos;owned&apos;<br/>the &apos;ordinary temperament&apos; of the 18th century, because its description was<br/>not as mathematically precise as we now are. They didn&apos;t use cents. They used<br/>their ears! Just like no good piano tuner ever tunes every piano the same<br/>EXACT way. See the quote below....</p><p>from <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/paulpoletti/T4D.PDF">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/paulpoletti/T4D.PDF</a>   .....</p><p>&quot;......Proof that Werckmeister would have used a completely different type of<br/>temperament for harpsichords, especially when used in a chamber music<br/>setting, is given by his brief description of a harpsichord (Clavier)<br/>tempering scheme in his 1698 treatise on realizing figured bass.<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s description is somewhat imprecise, but there can be little<br/>doubt that it describes yet another &quot;meantone modification&quot;. He probably<br/>started from a 1/5 or 1/6th Syntonic comma Meantone, but then deviated from<br/>the basic logic by adjusting G#, D#, and Bb toward their enharmonic<br/>equivalents, allowing them to be tolerable if not perfect when used for both<br/>harmonic functions. This is essentially the same sort of &quot;bending&quot; of the<br/>basic meantone logic found in the temperaments of Rameau, Couperin, and<br/>Schlick, and is probably much more representative of common practice among<br/>harpsichordists in the late-17th and early-18th centuries than is a primitive<br/>&quot;economy-class&quot; 1/4 Pythagorean comma well-temperament like &quot;Werckmeister<br/>III&quot;. Although this description was perhaps the first published unequal<br/>temperament description of the entire modern &quot;original instrument&quot; movement<br/>(being summarized in 1931 by F. T. Arnold), much like its French<br/>counterparts, it has been completely ignored by modern keyboard players....&quot;</p><p>I hope that clarifies what I was driving at.....yes, this is very based on<br/>subjective opinion, and I could be wrong, but we&apos;ll never know. I guess I<br/>just find Paul Poletti&apos;s reasoning compelling and accurate. It jives with my<br/>experience as a musician and with all the musicians I&apos;ve known.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>--<br/>OCEAN, n.

I think something in<br/>general like Poletti described, ie a &apos;common 18th century well-temperament&apos;<br/>with the rough outlines of WerckIII, but perhaps a wider C-E and a less wide<br/>E-G# and G#-C work better for those Bach pieces in remote keys from C, or the<br/>mannerist modulatory stuff......</p><p>&gt; Also, Poletti is referring ot something that has been fully translated into<br/>&gt; English now, the directions for the harpsichord tuning attached to the 1698<br/>&gt; treatise on the Figured Bass treatise, and it smells more like ET than any<br/>&gt; meantone-derived tuning.
