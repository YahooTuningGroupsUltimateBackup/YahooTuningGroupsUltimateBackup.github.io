Pure just intervals are considered dead and<br/>lifeless there.</p><p>Some Arabic modes (maqamat) such as Saba do not have an<br/>octave interval. Arabic scales, being descended from Greek<br/>scales, are built on tetrachords that usually span 4/3 or<br/>sometimes 5/4 and thus octaves don&apos;t always result.</p><p>Authentic African mbira tunings seldom contain many just<br/>intervals, including the octave.</p><p>I am told that panpipes played in the Amazonian rainforest<br/>have no octaves but I don&apos;t know this for a fact.</p><p>&gt; Was this 2:1 requirement introduced by tempering of the scale?</p><p>Since even in Western piano tuning, the octaves are<br/>stretched wide from 2/1, probably to increase interest by<br/>giving the octave some motion (and not to match inharmonic<br/>partials as is commonly supposed) who knows? The octave is<br/>the least interesting interval I can think of both<br/>harmonically (where all it does is slightly thicken the<br/>timbre) or melodically (where it is rather wide to be a<br/>step). I believe the only reason it has achieved wide<br/>usage is because it is an easily recognizablelandmark and<br/>thus facilitates tuning and notation of instruments that<br/>are tuned using repeating scale patterns. Of course it is<br/>the fact that the scale pattern repeats at all and not the<br/>fact that it repeats at 2/1 that makes the scale cohesive<br/>to the human wetware.</p><p>I would be delighted if you could show us examples of<br/>Indian scales that don&apos;t involve or require the octave -<br/>then I could add India to my list of sensible cultures<br/>that weren&apos;t so lazy they had to base everything on<br/>octaves!</p><p>Best,</p><p>Jeff</p></div><h3>J Scott &#x3C;xjscott@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2001 9:17:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hm.

The only such example of Indian<br/>scale is mentioned by Helmholtz [On the Sensations of Tone (1954), p<br/>517] where he reports a Madras Vina to have: the first octave 0-1199,<br/>and the second octave 1199-2398 cents.  If there are other references<br/>elsewhere, I do not as yet know.  I go a step beyond to state that,<br/>with any explicit reference yet to be found out (by me), NO Indian<br/>scale is  required to be octave. This sounds very strange.  Perhaps<br/>there is a reference or two, which I have missed. I do not know<br/>whether and how this can be verified.</p><p>Haresh.</p></div>
