Metachromatic shifts: intonational warp space<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>One &quot;special effect&quot; in the e-based tuning is a familiar progression<br/>diverted by a metachromatic 7-flavor cadence leading to an unexpected<br/>destination. While metachromatic sequences such as those discussed in<br/>Section 4.1 seem to have their own internal logic and sense of<br/>equilibrium, shifts of the kind we now consider can have an effect of<br/>dramatic surprise, as if a warp space had suddenly opened in the usual<br/>diatonic fabric.</p><p>As a basis for the examples that follow, let us consider a routine<br/>progression such as the following:</p><p>A4  G4   F4  E4  F4<br/>E4  D4   C4  B3  C4<br/>C4  Bb3  A3  G3  F3</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7sh000.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7sh000.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>In this type of idiom, characteristic of some 14th-15th century<br/>European styles and also common in neo-Gothic music, a series of sixth<br/>sonorities leads to a usual expansive cadence (M6-8 + M3-5) arriving<br/>at a complete 2:3:4 trine (here G3-B3-E4 to F3-C4-F4). Our version in<br/>the e-based tuning features the usual 11-flavor intervals and<br/>resolutions (see Section 3.1).</p><p>As Johannes Boen writes in 1357, the unstable thirds and sixths are<br/>like &quot;forerunners and handmaidens&quot; of the stable concord eventually<br/>following [12].</p><p>In the following variation, however, we discover that these<br/>forerunners have announced an unexpected guest:</p><p>A4  G4   F4       F*4<br/>E4  D4   C4       C*4<br/>C4  Bb3  A3  G*3  F*3</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7sh001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7sh001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>As an intonational closeup will show, the familiar diatonic degrees C4<br/>and F4 have suddenly become the upper notes of the 7-flavor cadential<br/>sonority G*3-C4-F4 (a rounded 0-440-936 cents, ~7:9:12), with an<br/>intensive resolution to F#*3-C*4-F*4 in which each of these upper<br/>voices ascends by a diesis (C4-C*4, F4-F*4).[13]</p><p>   F4 ------------------  +55 --- F*4<br/> (495)           (495)           (495)<br/>   C4 ------------------  +55 --- C*4<br/>(782,286)      (936,440)       (1200,705)<br/>   A3 --- -154 -- G*3 -- -209 --- F*3</p><p>This metachromatic &quot;surprise&quot; is made possible by the pivotal motion<br/>of the lowest voice from A3 to G*3, a descending step of a diminished<br/>third (~153.93 cents, equal to two diatonic semitones of ~76.97 cents).<br/>The following cadence in itself is a standard 7-flavor resolution: it<br/>is the sudden shift in getting there that produces the &quot;warp&quot; effect.</p><p>A somewhat milder variety of metachromatic shift may be the following,<br/>in which our initial routine progression often leading to F is<br/>diverted to a remissive 7-flavor cadence on G, with the upper voices<br/>progressing by usual diatonic steps (C4-D4, F4-G4):</p><p>A4  G4   F4       G4<br/>E4  D4   C4       D4<br/>C4  Bb3  A3  G*3  G3</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7sh002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7sh002.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here is an intonational close-up:</p><p>   F4 ------------------ +209 --- G4<br/>  (495)          (495)          (495)<br/>   C4 ------------------ +209 --- D4<br/>(782,286)      (936,440)      (1200,705)<br/>   A3 --- -154 -- G*3 --  -55 --- G3</p><p>In this more &quot;gentle&quot; shift, the upper voices have familiar diatonic<br/>patterns of steps: E4-D4-C4-D4 or A4-G4-F4-G4.</p><p>Metachromatic shifts of these kinds, ranging from the more &quot;exuberant&quot;<br/>or &quot;warplike&quot; to the more &quot;gentle,&quot; invite much exploration in<br/>practice and theory. They might be seen as a further development of<br/>the bold medieval chromaticism of Marchettus of Padua (1318).[14]</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>4.4. Subdiesis or 17-comma shifts<br/>---------------------------------</p><p>A more subtle kind of nuance in metachromatic progressions and<br/>cadences involves shifts by the small interval of the subdiesis or<br/>&quot;17-comma&quot; of around 21.68 cents. As discussed in Section II (Part 1),<br/>this subdiesis is equal to the difference between a regular diatonic<br/>semitone (e.g. E-F) at ~76.97 cents, and a diesis or small semitone<br/>(e.g. E-E*) at ~55.28 cents.</p><p>Additionally, the subdiesis is equal to the amount by which 17 fifths<br/>in the e-based tuning fall short of 10 pure octaves, thus the<br/>alternate name of &quot;17-comma.&quot;[15]</p><p>Here is a diagram showing the division of the regular semitone E-F<br/>into diesis and subdiesis, a division with immediate relevance to the<br/>musical examples which follow:</p><p>                       55.3                  21.7<br/>         |------------diesis-----------|--subdiesis--|<br/>         E                             E*            F<br/>         |-------------------------------------------|<br/>                         diatonic semitone<br/>                               77.0</p><p>In various progressions, notes a subdiesis apart such as E* and F may<br/>serve as alternative versions of the &quot;same&quot; degree or cadential goal,<br/>and this &quot;near-equivalence&quot; can facilitate motion from one 12-note<br/>manual to the other. Here we consider some routine illustrations.</p><p>Let us begin with the same standard progression as in our last<br/>examples, concluding with a cadence on F:</p><p>A4  G4   F4  E4  F4<br/>E4  D4   C4  B3  C4<br/>C4  Bb3  A3  G3  F3</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7sh000.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7sh000.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here is the same basic progression, but with the conclusion modified<br/>to an equivalent (or &quot;near-equivalent&quot;) 7-flavor cadence on E*:</p><p>A4  G4   F4  E4    E*4<br/>E4  D4   C4  B3    B*3<br/>C4  Bb3  A3  F#*3  E*3</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7cs001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7cs001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here the trine E*3-B*3-E*4 serves as a near-equivalent of F3-C4-F4.<br/>As an intonational closeup of the concluding cadence will show, this<br/>substitution makes possible a standard 7-flavor metachromatic<br/>resolution:</p><p>   F4 ---- -77 --- E4 ---  +55 --- E*4<br/>  (495)          (495)            (495)<br/>   C4 ---- -77 --- B3 ---  +55 --- B*4<br/>(782,286)      (936,440)       (1200,705)<br/>   A3 --- -231 -- F#*3 -- -209 --- E*3</p><p>In this intensive cadence from F#*3-B3-E4 to E*3-B*3-E*4, the lower<br/>voice descends by a regular whole-tone (F#*3-E*3) while the upper<br/>voices each ascend by a diesis (B3-B*3, E4-E*4).</p><p>Although no direct melodic motion or &quot;shift&quot; of a subdiesis occurs,<br/>there is a downward &quot;drift&quot; of a subdiesis, as may be seen in the<br/>melodic progressions of the upper parts: C4-B3-B*3 and F4-E4-E*4.<br/>These figures involve an approach to the 7-flavor sixth sonority by<br/>descents of a regular 77-cent diatonic semitone (C4-B3, F4-E4),<br/>followed by resolving ascents of a 55-cent diesis in the usual<br/>metachromatic manner. The difference between these motions measures<br/>the 22-cent downward drift.</p><p>An example very concisely illustrating this kind of drift is the<br/>following:</p><p>F4  E4    E*4<br/>C4  B3    B*3<br/>F3  F#*3  E*3</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7cs002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7cs002.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here we begin at the stable trine F3-C4-F4, and move to a 7-flavor<br/>cadential sonority F#*3-B3-E4, again resolving to E*3-B*3-E*4, with a<br/>downward drift of a subdiesis from our starting point. In its approach<br/>to this cadential sonority, the lowest voice ascends (F3-F#*3) by a<br/>kind of small whole-tone of around 187.53 cents, a subdiesis narrower<br/>than the usual step F3-G3.</p><p>Again, each upper voice descends by a regular semitone (C4-B3, F4-E4)<br/>and then cadentially ascends by a diesis (B3-B*3, E4-E*4). The<br/>difference of 22 cents between these steps measures the drift.</p><p>Direct subdiesis shifts can also be a pleasant nuance of style, as in<br/>this idiom:</p><p>D4  E4    E*4<br/>C4  B3    B*3<br/>G3  F#*3  E*3</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7cs003.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7cs003.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here a relatively concordant but unstable G3-C4-D4 sonority (~6:8:9)<br/>builds up to the sixth sonority F#*3-B3-E4, resolving again to<br/>E*3-B*3-E*4.</p><p>An intonational closeup may show the logic of the subdiesis shift<br/>G3-F#*3 in the lowest voice:</p><p>   D4 ---- +209 --- E4 ---  +55 --- E*4<br/>  (209)           (495)            (495)<br/>   C4 ----  -77 --- B3 ---  +55 --- B*4<br/>(705,495)        (936,440)       (1200,705)<br/>   G3 ----  -22 -- F#*3 -- -209 --- E*3</p><p>In the first sonority G3-C4-D4, all notes are on the same keyboard,<br/>as they must be in order to form the regular fifth (~3:2), fourth<br/>(~4:3), and major second (~9:8) of this ~6:8:9 sonority.</p><p>To form the following 7-flavor cadential sonority F#*3-B3-E4, near<br/>7:9:12, however, the lowest voice must move from G3 to F#*3 on the<br/>upper keyboard, descending by a subdiesis. From this point, a typical<br/>resolution to E*3-B*4-E*4 follows, as in our previous examples.</p><p>In the outgoing and ebullient intonational setting of the e-based<br/>tuning with its various flavors and colorful contrasts between<br/>stability and instability, such subdiesis or &quot;17-comma&quot; shifts or<br/>drifts can be pleasantly stimulating.</p><p>----------------------------------------------<br/>4.5. The 7-flavor or metachromatic minor sixth<br/>----------------------------------------------</p><p>On our 24-note keyboard, a note on the lower manual and the note<br/>visually a fifth higher on the upper manual (e.g. F3-C*4) form the<br/>interval of a small or 7-flavor minor sixth at ~759.89 cents, rather<br/>close to 14:9 (~764.92 cents).</p><p>A very characteristic resolution by oblique motion (m6-5) involves the<br/>descent of the upper voice downward by a 55.28-cent diesis, here<br/>C*4-C4, to arrive at a stable fifth (~704.61 cents). Here is an<br/>example in two voices:</p><p>C*4  C4<br/>F3</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7ms001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7ms001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>An intensified three-voice version of this resolution adds a middle<br/>voice at a fifth above the lowest voice, forming an unstable sonority<br/>featuring the vertical interval of the diesis between the two upper<br/>voices (~0-705-760 cents):</p><p>C*4  C4<br/>C4<br/>F3</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7ms002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/eb7ms002.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>As in the previous example, the highest voice descends by a diesis<br/>(C*4-C4), resolving the small outer sixth to a fifth, and here also<br/>the vertical diesis between the upper voices to a unison:</p><p>   C*4 --- -55 --- E4<br/>  (55)            (0)<br/>   C4 ------------------<br/>(760,705)      (705,705)<br/>   F3 ------------------</p><p>These examples are metachromatic variations on 13th-century<br/>progressions in which a minor sixth resolves to a fifth, a very<br/>expressive figure in Pythagorean tuning also.[16]</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/>5. The &quot;near-Phi&quot; or supraminor sixth: &quot;Fibonacci drift&quot;<br/>--------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A very special idiom in the e-based tuning features the supraminor<br/>sixth at around 836.86 cents, quite close to the ratio of the Golden<br/>Section, or Phi, at ~1.61803398874989484820459, or ~833.09 cents.</p><p>More generally, this type of &quot;Phi-sixth&quot; is available in a variety of<br/>neo-Gothic tunings including a &quot;17-flavor&quot; set of supraminor/submajor<br/>thirds and sixths[17], so that most of what follows could apply to any<br/>of these tunings, allowing for fine shadings of interval sizes and<br/>colors.</p><p>In a neo-Gothic setting, Phi-sixths when presented in certain<br/>&quot;floating&quot; contexts may have a quality at once of complexity and of<br/>relative blend, with the overall impression one of a certain &quot;nebulous<br/>concord.&quot; They are very different than the primary concords, stable<br/>fifths and fourths, and yet do not necessarily have any strong sense<br/>of directed tension or motion. One might describe them as having a<br/>pleasantly foggy or almost Debussyan quality, inviting a kind of<br/>&quot;neo-Gothic Impressionism.&quot;[18]</p><p>Accordingly, an idiom known as &quot;Fibonacci drift&quot;[19] features two<br/>upper voices moving in fourths above a sustained lowest note,<br/>&quot;drifting&quot; around a sonority with a supraminor or Phi-sixth plus a<br/>supraminor third, in the e-based tuning a rounded 0-341-837 cents.<br/>Here is an example of Fibonacci drift, illustrating one kind of<br/>transitional progression for returning to a &quot;usual&quot; neo-Gothic style,<br/>with the rhythm possibly best expressed as a mixture of 3/4 and 2/4:</p><p>(3/4)             (2/4)<br/>  1    2  +   3   + | 1   +  2   + | 1    2   | 1    2 ||<br/>  F#4     G4  F#4 F4  F#4 G4 F#4 F4  F#4  F4    F#4<br/>  C#4     D4  C#4 C4  C#4 D4 C#4 C4  C#4        B3<br/>  Bb3                                           B3</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/ebphi001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/ebphi001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Most typically, as in the e-based tuning, the Phi-sixth is spelled as<br/>an augmented fifth and the supraminor third as an augmented second,<br/>here Bb3-C#4-F#4, although some tuning systems use other spellings.</p><p>Let us first focus on the basic Fibonacci drift figure, with its<br/>melodic pattern of diatonic and chromatic semitone steps oscillating<br/>around the Phi-sixth sonority. Here it may simplify matters to<br/>indicate the intervals formed by the upper voices with the sustained<br/>lowest note as they move together in fourths (~495.39 cents):</p><p> F#4 -- +77 --  G4  -- -77 -- F#4 -- -132 -- F4  -- +132 -- F#4 ...<br/>(837)         (913)          (837)          (705)          (837)<br/> C#4 -- +77 --  D4  -- -77 -- C#4 -- -132 -- C4  -- +132 -- C#4 ...<br/>(341)         (418)          (341)          (209)          (341)<br/> Bb3</p><p>From a vertical perspective, the two upper voices start at the<br/>Phi-sixth sonority Bb3-C#4-F#4, and ascend by 77-cent diatonic<br/>semitones to a usual major sixth sonority Bb3-D4-G4 (0-418-913 cents),<br/>then returning to the Phi sonority. Next they descend by 132-cent<br/>chromatic semitones to the relatively concordant quintal/quartal<br/>sonority Bb3-C4-F4, or ~8:9:12, combining an outer fifth and upper<br/>fourth with a lower major second, and ascend back to the Phi sonority.</p><p>The total effect is a kind of oscillation or &quot;drift&quot; which can be<br/>repeated with various forms of elaboration or ornamentation.<br/>Melodically, the two upper voices undulate together through a cycle of<br/>diatonic and chromatic semitone steps adjacent to their notes in the<br/>Phi sonority: here C#4-D4-C#4-C4-C#4... and F#4-G4-F#4-F4-F#4....</p><p>In this example, the Fibonacci drift passage, involving as it does a<br/>kind of 17-flavor sonority, not inappositely concludes with a standard<br/>17-flavor cadence, typically marking a return in a composition or<br/>improvisation back to a more usual neo-Gothic style:</p><p>   F#4 -- -132 -- F4 --- +132 -- F#4<br/>  (495)          (363)          (705)<br/>   C#4 ----------------- -209 -- B3<br/>(837,341)      (705,341)       (705,0)<br/>   Bb3 ----------------- +132 -- B3</p><p>To make this transition, the highest voice descends from the<br/>supraminor sixth to the fifth above the lowest note (F#4-F4), thus<br/>forming a usual 17-flavor cadential sonority Bb3-C#4-F4 (see Part 2,<br/>Section 3.2), or 0-341-705 cents, which then resolves in standard<br/>fashion, the lower supraminor third contracting to a unison and the<br/>upper submajor third expanding to a fifth. We arrive at the stable<br/>fifth B3-F#4.</p><p>In addition to its vertical affinity with the Fibonacci drift passage,<br/>this 17-flavor cadence has a melodic affinity with its characteristic<br/>chromatic semitone steps, here Bb3-B3 and F4-F#4 in the two outer<br/>voices. There may be a pleasing contrast between the coloristic<br/>drifting or &quot;floating&quot; quality of the step F4-F#4 (or F#4-F4) in the<br/>Fibonacci figure, and its use here in directed cadential action.</p><p>Our second example concludes the same Fibonacci drift passage with a<br/>different variety of cadential maneuver:</p><p>(3/4)             (2/4)<br/>  1    2  +   3   + | 1   +  2   + | 1    2   | 1    2 ||<br/>  F#4     G4  F#4 F4  F#4 G4 F#4 F4  F#4        G4<br/>  C#4     D4  C#4 C4  C#4 D4 C#4 C4  C#4        D4<br/>  Bb3                                Bb3  A3    G3</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/ebphi002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/ebphi002.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here the lower voice of the Phi sonority Bb3-C#4-F#4 descends by a<br/>diatonic semitone (Bb3-A3) to form the regular major sixth sonority<br/>A3-C#4-F#4 (0-418-913 cents), leading to a routine 11-flavor cadence<br/>(Part 2, Section 3.1).

As it happens, all three cadences have involved an<br/>intensive manner, with descending whole-tone and ascending semitone<br/>motions; remissive resolutions further multiply the variety of<br/>permutations and choices.[21]</p><p>With its richness of intonational flavors, progressions, and<br/>metachromatic idioms, the e-based tuning may exemplify the plethora of<br/>possibilities offered by neo-Gothic tunings and temperaments.</p><p>-----<br/>Notes<br/>-----</p><p>12. Wolf Frobenius, _Johannes Boens Musica und Seine<br/>Konsonanzenlehre_, Freiburger Schriften zur Musikwissenschaft<br/>(Musikwissenschaftliche Verlags-Gesselschaft mbH Stuttgart, 1971),<br/>Latin text at p. 70.</p><p>13. To make this kind of rather intricate diagram more visually<br/>appealing, I use explicit dashed lines to show that a given voice<br/>sustains a note while other voices move, although this would follow<br/>from my general convention that each note in a given voice is<br/>sustained until the next note in that voice, or the end of the<br/>example, unless a rest is indicated.</p><p>14. Marchettus describes an idiom he calls a &quot;feigned color&quot; -- freely<br/>translated, a deceptive cadential inflection -- in which a major sixth<br/>expected to expand to an octave (e.g. E3-C#4 to D3-D4) instead<br/>contracts to a fifth with the upper voice descending by a direct<br/>chromatic semitone (e.g. E3-C#4 to F3-C4, upper voice C#4-C4). While<br/>this idiom involves an unexpected conclusion to an anticipated<br/>cadence, our &quot;metachromatic shifts&quot; involve a cadence at an unexpected<br/>place which itself follows standard progressions (here M6-8 and M3-5).<br/>For more on Marchettus, see for example my paper written to celebrate<br/>Microfest 2001, &quot;Xenharmonic Excursion to Padua, 1318: Marchettus, the<br/>cadential diesis, and neo-Gothic tunings&quot; (2001),<br/><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/marchetmf.txt">http://value.net/~mschulter/marchetmf.txt</a> (ASCII text version)<br/><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/marchetmf.zip">http://value.net/~mschulter/marchetmf.zip</a> (ASCII text and PostScript);<br/>Joseph L.

Seventeen fifths are precisely equal to 10 octaves in 17-tET,<br/>where the fifth is defined as 10/17 octave.</p><p>16. In a standard medieval Pythagorean tuning, the regular minor sixth<br/>is 128:81 (~792.18 cents), and the diatonic semitone 256:243 (~90.22<br/>cents) -- with the fifth, of course, a pure 3:2 (~701.96 cents). Here<br/>is a Pythagorean version of the striking three-voice resolution shown<br/>above, with an unstable sonority of 162:243:256 (~0-702-792 cents),<br/>the upper voice descending by a usual diatonic semitone or minor<br/>second (m6-5 resolution with lowest voice, m2-1 resolution with middle<br/>voice):</p><p>   C4 --- -90 ---- B3<br/>  (90)            (0)<br/>   B3 ------------------<br/>(792,702)      (702,702)<br/>   E3 ------------------</p><p>17. The term &quot;17-flavor&quot; suggests ratios for these intervals in the<br/>general vicinity of 17:14 (~336.13 cents), 21:17 (~365.83 cents);<br/>34:21 (~834.17 cents, very close to Phi), and 28:17 (~863.87 cents).</p><p>18. I am reminded of Carl Sandburg&apos;s poem about the fog coming on<br/>little cat feet, or of the Great Nebula in Orion.</p><p>19. This idiom is named for the mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known<br/>by his nickname of Fibonacci, who in his _Liber abaci_ (c. 1202) made<br/>what may be the first significant introduction of Arabic decimal<br/>numbers to the non-Islamic portion of medieval Europe. Fibonacci&apos;s<br/>famous series of numbers, devised to solve a problem concerning the<br/>reproduction of rabbits, begins 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55..., each new<br/>term starting with the third being equal to the sum of the two<br/>previous terms. The ratio between successive terms converges on the<br/>Golden Section. On Phi and its possible relationship to harmonic<br/>complexity or &quot;entropy,&quot; see Margo Schulter and David Keenan, &quot;The<br/>Golden Mediant: Complex ratios and metastable musical intervals,&quot; 18<br/>September 2000; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/12915">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/12915</a>.</p><p>20. A kind of precedent for this cadential approach might be found in<br/>some 14th-century pieces where, in one interpretation of the<br/>accidentals, an augmented fifth may move by descent of the lower voice<br/>to a major sixth, expanding in usual fashion to an octave:</p><p>C#4     D4<br/>F3  E3  D4</p><p>In 14th-16th century music, convention calls for various kinds of<br/>accidental inflections sometimes specified in the notation, but often<br/>left to the discretion of the performers. On the 14th-century question<br/>of the augmented fifth in approaching an M6-8 progression, see<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/hex.html</a>&gt;, Section 2.4. In<br/>Pythagorean tuning, this approach would look as follows:</p><p> C#4 ---------------  +90 -- D4<br/>(816)         (906)        (1200)<br/> F3  -- -90 -- E3 -- -204 -- D3</p><p>Here the augmented fifth or _tetratonus_ F3-C#4, equal to four 9:8<br/>whole-tones at 6561:4096 (~815.64 cents), proceeds by the descent of a<br/>90-cent diatonic semitone in the lowest voice (F3-E3) to a regular<br/>major sixth E3-C#4 at 27:16 (~905.87 cents), followed by the cadence<br/>to the octave.</p><p>21. Standard remissive resolutions for the cadential sonorities of our<br/>three Fibonacci drift examples: first example, Bb3-C#4-F4 to C4-G4<br/>(17-flavor, lower voices contracting to unison on C4); second example,<br/>A3-C#4-F#4 to G#3-D#4-G#4 (11-flavor); third example, G#*3-C#4-F#4 to<br/>G#3-D#4-G#4 (7-flavor). The last two progressions involve the<br/>equivalence D#4=Eb*4. &quot;Standard&quot; remissive or intensive resolutions<br/>combine regular 209-cent whole-tone steps with steps of a 77-cent<br/>diatonic semitone (11-flavor), a 132-cent chromatic semitone<br/>(17-flavor), or a 55-cent diesis (7-flavor). It happens that our<br/>24-note gamut makes available such resolutions in both the intensive<br/>and remissive manners for these three examples.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>6/7/2001 9:07:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24448">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/24448</a></p><p>&gt;        -------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;              The e-based tuning and metachromatic progressions:<br/>&gt;                         A feast of neo-Gothic flavors<br/>&gt;            (Part 3: Metachromatic shifts and the near-Phi sixth)<br/>&gt;        -------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I just wanted to mention that I, for one, am enjoying the<br/>new &quot;midified&quot; version of Margo Schulter&apos;s recent articles.
