Instead, they<br/>are distributions or &apos;smears&apos; along the pitch axis, where a certain &apos;note&apos;<br/>on the scale associated with the underlying maqam may present itself in a<br/>multitude of pitches depending upon where the music is &apos;coming from&apos; within<br/>the past few sounds.

Also, a given note, such as saba, is going to occupy<br/>a different region depending on the maqam in which it appears.  This<br/>is certainly true in Arabic music.  This presents a notational<br/>nightmare of course, because what gets notated as E-quarter-flat in<br/>maqam rast may be different than the E-quarter-flat in maqam bayati.</p><p> &gt;                       Therefore, I do not believe a fixed tuning, no matter<br/> &gt;how intricate, is the answer for Turkish music and possibly other musics.<br/> &gt;The concept of &apos;tuning&apos; has to be viewed in a revolutionary manner with a<br/> &gt;fluid  and dynamic structure.</p><p>        It has been argued that fixed tuning/notation isn&apos;t so great<br/>for recording western music, either.  Certainly folk musicians of<br/>various sorts complain about notational limitations.  But Sibelius is<br/>still going to be a great tool, so long as you have the space to make<br/>a note someplace that the note saba is the 4-comma version, instead of<br/>the 5-comma version in the piece you&apos;re working on.  (I keep abusing<br/>the note saba, and the maqam... I could be wrong on precise details,<br/>but I believe I&apos;m making my point clear.)</p><p>        Does your research involve investigations into seyir?  I&apos;ve<br/>always found that a fascinating approach to structuring melody and<br/>improvisation, but there&apos;s so little material about it in English.</p><p>        Hmm... it just occured to me: an investigation the seyir<br/>phenomenon wrt to Sethares&apos;s research might be interesting, too, but I<br/>need to think about that some more...</p><p>--<br/>William S.
