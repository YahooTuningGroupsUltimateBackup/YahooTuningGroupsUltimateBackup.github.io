This is the one<br/>to use for listening to and editing the current scale.</p><p>In arpeggio window, you can play as high as you like in the arpeggio. You<br/>can also play the scale just as you do in the Scale window, if you choose follow<br/>scale as the arpeggio to play.</p><p>You can have as many Arpeggio windows showing at once, each with its own mode,<br/>and if you want, each can have its own scale too (to do this, untick Sync<br/>scale with m.w. - m.w. = main window - , and to keep the appropriate modes list<br/>showing for each scale, also untick Sync modes)</p><p>So if scale is already made and you are working with the modes, it&apos;s better<br/>to use the arpeggio window.</p><p>If both are decided on, you can use the Seed window.</p><p>Notes of mode are played consecutively from key to left of 1 down to the bottom right key of<br/>the typing area of the keyboard.</p><p>You can use the space bar as a sustain pedal when playing from P.c. keyboard.</p><p>For the help, what there is of it so far, click the ? icon for the Seed window.</p><p>As the help will mention, some triads can&apos;t be played using p.c. keyboard, e.g. on this one I&apos;m<br/>using now, the letters 3, 4, and 5 can&apos;t all be typed and held down simultaneously. Hold down<br/>3 and 4 in text editor, then hold down the 5 and it won&apos;t show. Same for many other<br/>keyboard triads. Other keyboards do this with other combinations of keys. Seems to be<br/>independent of operating system, so something to do with the p.c. keybaord hardware itself.<br/>So FTS just never gets the information that the 5 is held down, and as far as I can tell,<br/>neither does the p.c. either, the information never leaves the p.c. keyboard. So nothing<br/>to do about it.</p><p>Of course p.c. keybaords do need to be able to play some combinations of three keys such as<br/>Ctrl + Alt + letter, or whatever. However, seems p.c. keyboards perhaps weren&apos;t designed<br/>with object of using them to play arbitrary triads :-)</p><p>You can still play the triads to listen to them by playing the notes one at a time and<br/>holding down the space bar sustain &quot; pedal&quot;.</p><p>You can also play the mode of the scale from second row of the p.c. keyboard, and use first,<br/>third and fourth rows to play any accidentals, simulating split key type effect.</p><p>For this, use Seed, Scale or Arpeggio | P.c. Keyboard Voice | Pitches for keyboard rows<br/>| 2nd row arpeggio, others accidentals (pa only). (pa only = play along only)</p><p>Incidentally, same drop list also has option to modulate each row of p.c. keyboard by a custom<br/>modulation.</p><p>If for example you modulate each row by 6/5 and use 1/1 3/2 as the scale, you can then play<br/>a 2D triangular lattice from the p.c. keybaord, and by changing the numbers there, play the<br/>other 2D triangular lattices in the same way.</p><p>Perhaps I&apos;ll add more about this to the help. If you click the blue ? icon you will get some<br/>help about this</p><p>All of this works here. If you find any of it doesn&apos;t work, let me know and we can find out<br/>what is causing it.</p><p>This is all for p.c. keyboard. For Midi relaying from Midi keyboard, you don&apos;t need to show any<br/>of the windows; just select the keyboard for the Midi In, and it will relay to<br/>the current scale and mode as shown in the main window.</p><p>Sometimes one might want to see the notes shown graphically as they are played, with the<br/>values in cents / ratios. Best window to show for this is the Seed Window / Play.<br/>To see where they are being relayed, in which channel, and the pitch bends used in cents,<br/>show Out | Options | Notes In Play channels.</p><p>Keyboard mapping configured from In | Options | Configure Midi Keyboard | Play Arpeggio with,<br/>or use In | Options | Midi relaying defaults... which sets of 1/1 to pitch of middle C<br/>and to midi note 60. For more about this, see the beta download page sections about midi relaying,<br/>which is up to date.</p><p>I&apos;m sure there are things that can be done to improve the layout and the help for all this,<br/>and any comments that will help with that are much valued.</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/ftsbeta.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/ftsbeta.htm</a></p><p>Robert</p></div>
