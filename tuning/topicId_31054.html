He proposed a &apos;badness&apos; measure defined as</p><p>step^3 cent</p><p>where step is a measure of the typical number of notes in a scale for<br/>this temperament (given any desired degree of harmonic depth), and<br/>cent is a measure of the deviation from JI &apos;consonances&apos; in cents.<br/>He then ranked his 505 temperaments by &apos;goodness&apos;. The familiar ones<br/>don&apos;t come in until later, so bear with me . . .</p><p>Topping off Gene&apos;s list are some very funky simple temperaments, with<br/>errors larger than 12-tET but nonetheless sure to be of interest to<br/>many, especially those working in adaptive tuning and adaptive<br/>timbring. They also should interest those looking for planar<br/>temperaments, and all should interest those looking for very simple<br/>JI scales without wolves. For these, I quote the simplest pair of<br/>unison vectors:</p><p>&gt; (1)  &lt;21/20,27/25&gt;<br/>&gt; (2)  &lt;8/7,15/14&gt;<br/>&gt; (3)  &lt;9/8,15/14&gt;<br/>&gt; (4)  &lt;25/24,49/48&gt;<br/>&gt; (5)  &lt;15/14,25/24&gt;<br/>&gt; (6)  &lt;21/20,25/24&gt;<br/>&gt; (7)  &lt;15/14,35/32&gt;<br/>&gt; (8)  &lt;7/6,16/15&gt;<br/>&gt; (9)  &lt;16/15,21/20&gt;</p><p>Then we have a shadow of 12-tET that maybe Gene can describe more<br/>fully -- it would seem to be related to tritone substitution (real<br/>jazzy, dude).</p><p>&gt; (10) &lt;36/35,50/49&gt;</p><p>Then we have Gene&apos;s own creation, without a sign of the complex comma<br/>he discovered and named it after:</p><p>&gt; (11) &lt;2401/2400,4375/4374&gt; Ennealimmal</p><p>Then more funky ones:</p><p>&gt; (12) &lt;16/15,49/48&gt;<br/>&gt; (13) &lt;10/9,16/15&gt;</p><p>Then the one that I think is Dave Keenan&apos;s chain-of-minor-thirds as<br/>in this 11-note scale:<br/><a href="http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/ChainOfMinor3rds.htm">http://www.uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/ChainOfMinor3rds.htm</a></p><p>&gt; (14) &lt;49/48,126/125&gt;</p><p>Another funky one:</p><p>&gt; (15) &lt;28/27,49/48&gt;</p><p>And then:</p><p>&gt; (16) &lt;225/224,1029/1024&gt; Miracle</p><p>&gt; (17) &lt;50/49,64/63&gt; Paultone</p><p>More funk:</p><p>&gt; (18) &lt;16/15,50/49&gt;</p><p>This one which I think came up as number 1 on Graham&apos;s ranking of<br/>these:</p><p>&gt; (19) &lt;126/125,1728/1715&gt;</p><p>And then another 12-tET-shadow system I&apos;ll let Gene talk about, which<br/>is what you get when you assume the meantone dominant seventh is<br/>4:5:6:7:</p><p>&gt; (20) &lt;36/35,64/63&gt;</p><p>Gene only posted the top 20.

The Pythagorean<br/>region around 702 cents is one obvious choice, with various ways of<br/>handling the 3-7 schisma. My own chosen solution is to take a chain of<br/>23 fifths or 24 notes with the middle fifth &quot;virtually tempered&quot; by<br/>the full schisma (about 3.80 cents), and all the others pure. Graham<br/>Breed has advocated 135-tET as an ideal regular schisma temperament.</p><p>Since the region around 704 cents was mentioned in this thread, I<br/>would note that around 704.6 cents we get a virtually just 4:7 from 15<br/>fifths up, with the other 2-3-7-9 ratios within about 5 cents of just.</p><p>If one is seeking near-pure 5-limit ratios in the area of 704 cents,<br/>then the &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning suggested by Erv Wilson&apos;s Scale Tree and<br/>described by Keenan Pepper, with fifths at around 704.10 cents, has an<br/>interval of 21 fifths up with a size of something like 386 cents.<br/>While it&apos;s an exotic touch at a few locations from a 24-note<br/>neo-Gothic viewpoint, someone looking for a 5-limit tuning and ready<br/>to use lots of notes per octave might find it of interest.</p><p>However, I wouldn&apos;t describe the &quot;Noble Fifth&quot; tuning as very accurate<br/>for ratios of 2-3-7-9, and in my view it takes much of its charm in<br/>this department from the &quot;ambiguity&quot; of ratios such a large major<br/>third (13 fourths up) at around 447 cents, or 17:22 if one wants an<br/>integer approximation. This may be closer to the &quot;near-10:13&quot; quality<br/>of 24-tET or 29-tET than to a pure or near-pure 7:9.</p><p>This suggests to me that someone looking for a balance between 5-limit<br/>and 7-limit ratios in this part of the spectrum might favor something<br/>around 46-tET, often discussed in connection with the srutar, for<br/>example.</p><p>From a neo-Gothic viewpoint, of course, the complex ratios formed by<br/>shorter chains of fifths in this region are a very major attraction.<br/>However, as this discussion suggests, there are many ways of looking<br/>at a tuning.</p><p>Incidentally, if I were describing a &quot;hyper-Pythagorean&quot; tuning of the<br/>22-tET variety, I might express the ambiguity as one between 35:36 and<br/>27:28, with the same interval of 1/22 octave representing, for example,<br/>the difference either between a near-4:5 and a near-7:9 third (7 vs. 8<br/>steps), or between a near-7:9 third and a near-3:4 fourth (8 vs. 9 steps).<br/>However, I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s the same kind of concept with these ratios<br/>as the one notated in this thread.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=31096 href="#31096">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2001 3:56:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Incidentally, if I were describing a &quot;hyper-Pythagorean&quot; tuning of<br/>the<br/>&gt; 22-tET variety, I might express the ambiguity as one between 35:36<br/>and<br/>&gt; 27:28, with the same interval of 1/22 octave representing, for<br/>example,<br/>&gt; the difference either between a near-4:5 and a near-7:9 third (7<br/>vs. 8<br/>&gt; steps), or between a near-7:9 third and a near-3:4 fourth (8 vs. 9<br/>steps).<br/>&gt; However, I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s the same kind of concept with these<br/>ratios<br/>&gt; as the one notated in this thread.</p><p>Hi Margo,</p><p>You&apos;ve found two just intervals which come out as the 1-step interval<br/>of 22-tone equal temperament: 35:36 and 27:28. Therefore, dividing<br/>these ratios by one another gives you a unison vector of 22-tone<br/>equal temperament:</p><p>(27:28)/(35:36) = 243:245</p><p>Since we are talking about ratios involving the three primes 3, 5,<br/>and 7, a three-dimensional just lattice is the space in which they<br/>live, and three independent unison vectors are required to define a<br/>closed temperament, such as 22-tET. Besides the one we found above,<br/>it&apos;s easy to find two others, by dividing other pairs of just<br/>intervals that come out the same in 22-tET:</p><p>dividing two ratios for the 9-step interval:<br/>(9:16)/(4:7) = 63:64</p><p>dividing two ratios for the 11-step interval:<br/>(7:10)/(5:7) = 49:50</p><p>Together, the three unison vectors<br/>&lt;49:50, 63:64, 243:245&gt;</p><p>define 22-tone equal temperament -- no other temperament has these<br/>three unison vectors.</p><p>What you saw in this thread was _pairs_ of unison vectors like<br/>&lt;80:81, 125:126&gt;</p><p>A pair of unison vectors won&apos;t collapse the three-dimensional just<br/>lattice into a closed tuning; instead, they will collapse it into a<br/>linear temperament. A linear temperament has a potentially unlimited<br/>number of notes, but it&apos;s constructed very simply. There is a single<br/>generator, an interval which is iterated over and over again to get<br/>more and more notes from the first. And there is a period of<br/>repetition, with which every note is transposed indefinitely upwards<br/>and downwards. The period of repetition is usually an octave (or<br/>whatever interval of equivalence is chosen), but often turns out to<br/>be a fraction 1/N of an octave, where N is an integer greater than 1.</p><p>Hopefully this clarifies some of the things that may have been<br/>puzzling you about this thread . . . if not, I would be more than<br/>happy to attempt to answer further questions.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p></div><h3><a id=31098 href="#31098">ðŸ”—</a>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;D.KEENAN@UQ.NET.AU&#x3E;</h3><span>12/5/2001 4:36:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; JI scales without wolves.
