Certainly high-quality, but perhaps a little more than<br/>you wanted to spend?  ;-)</p><p>It&apos;s odd that all the toy pianos made by Schoenhut (the largest maker,<br/>started in 1872) have full-size keys (allegedly &quot;to ease your child&apos;s<br/>transition to full-size piano&quot;)--so its a sure thing little fingers won&apos;t<br/>be playing any 7 chords.  Goes to show it&apos;s parents that buy the things.<br/>(On the same principle, pet food has to smell good to people.)</p><p>The hammers on all Schoenhuts strike metal bars, so whether or not it&apos;s a<br/>piano is debatable.  On the plus side, you won&apos;t have to worry about<br/>humidity or tuning it.  If you get tired of it, you can take it apart<br/>and make a xylophone.</p><p>You can hear what a Schoenhut sounds like on CD-ROM: &quot;The Art of the Toy<br/>Piano&quot; by Margaret Leng Tan.  She&apos;s a Julliard Ph.D. graduate that goes<br/>around the country giving concerts on one of these things, God knows why.<br/>When she&apos;s not playing toy pianos, she&apos;s playing the works of John Cage,<br/>which is pretty much the same thing in my book. :-)</p><p>Of course, another way to look at this is: you can easily pay 600 times<br/>more for non-toy grand piano.  Will it really sound 600 times better?<br/>I seriously doubt it.  Maybe everyone should play toy pianos like Ms. Tan.</p><p>Frankly, for a child why just buy an inexpensive electronic keyboard, like<br/>a Casio?  Many of these have reduced size keys. The timbre stinks, but it<br/>stays in tune even better than the Schoenhut and is a whole lot more<br/>portable.  Nowadays even the cheap ones have 8 or more voices.  If it<br/>breaks, you just buy a new one. And most important of all, you can turn<br/>down the volume! (Of course, an electronic keyboard is very blue collar<br/>and won&apos;t impress the neighbors or help get little Billy into prep school.)</p><p>Too bad nobody makes a mechanical keyboard-size-reducing-attachment for<br/>standard pianos.  It would be easy to do: just a smaller keyboard with<br/>bent levers that go where fingers would normally go, and some kind of<br/>clamp to hold it in place.</p><p>But I forgot: grown-ups are hopelessly conservative about the standard<br/>keyboard.  It will be the last thing on earth to change.  Look at the<br/>typewriter: QWERTY (designed to be slow so mechanical typewriters wouldn&apos;t<br/>jam) still reigns supreme.</p><p>Also, the market expects instruments have to be &quot;works of art&quot;--exotic<br/>materials, inefficient low-volume manufacturing, fancy finishes--with snob<br/>appeal.  Otherwise they would be as cheap as typewriters or computers (which<br/>are a whole lot more complicated and difficult to make)--or toy pianos.</p><p>Good luck in your search!</p></div><h3><a id=36381 href="#36381">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2002 7:12:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Mark G.

But glad to see the<br/>debate has started.</p><p>The classification of musical instruments into families is pretty much<br/>an empty academic exercise, reeking of Aristotle.   However, just for<br/>laughs, I checked a few authorities--</p><p>   List the piano as a &quot;stringed instrument&quot;:<br/>&#x9;Culver, Musical Acoustics<br/>&#x9;Forsyth, Orchestration</p><p>   List the piano in a special group (along with harp and celesta):<br/>&#x9;Kennan, Technique of Orchestration<br/>&#x9;<br/>   List the piano as a percussion instrument:<br/>&#x9;Rimsky-Korsakov: Principle of Orchestration</p><p>So, everybody is right!  Guess it depends on what one chooses as the<br/>&quot;essential&quot; feature:<br/>&#x9;How the instrument is played<br/>&#x9;How the instrument is used in the orchestra<br/>&#x9;What is the sound-producing mechanism</p><p>A similar problem comes up in biology all the time in the area of<br/>taxonomy.  There are two camps: &quot;lumpers&quot; and &quot;splitters&quot;.  Today<br/>we regard DNA as the &quot;essential&quot; attribute, but counter examples<br/>exist that make this awkward (for example, the actress Jamie Lee<br/>Curtis happens to a genetic male, but you won&apos;t catch her using<br/>the Men&apos;s restroom).</p><p>The problem of what makes a lemon a lemon is a huge one in modern<br/>Anglo-American philosophy: see Quine &quot;Natural Kinds&quot;, Kripke,<br/>Putnam, Donellan, etc.  (Meanwhile, I&apos;ll go make music.)</p><p>A man-made object like a musical instrument is an even more<br/>difficult classification problem.  It may be quite arbitrary.</p><p>As far as whether an electric piano is a piano, one could be<br/>misled by language.  Sometimes adjectives are &quot;differentia&quot; defining<br/>a subcategory (e.g, &quot;red rose&quot;), but sometimes they create a new<br/>category altogether:</p><p>&#x9;German silver (copper-zinc-nickel alloy)<br/>&#x9;fool&apos;s gold (iron pyrite)<br/>&#x9;Osage orange (tree and fruit)<br/>&#x9;Jerusalem artichoke (plant)<br/>&#x9;Jerusalem cricket (insect)<br/>&#x9;Oregon grape (plant)<br/>&#x9;skunk cabbage (plant)<br/>&#x9;miner&apos;s lettuce (plant)<br/>&#x9;mountain ash (plant)<br/>&#x9;mountain cranberry (plant)<br/>&#x9;dumb waiter (machine)<br/>&#x9;horseless carriage (machine)<br/>&#x9;Jaw harp (musical instrument)<br/>&#x9;electric eye (machine)</p><p>(In common names of plants, adjectives like &quot;Indian&quot;, &quot;mountain&quot;,<br/>&quot;desert&quot;, &quot;horse&quot;, or a geographical proper name, very often mean<br/>the plant is unrelated to the plant name that follows.)</p><p>Is the electric eye an eye?  Not to a biologist.</p><p>To sum up, just because their is mock turtle soup, one shouldn&apos;t go<br/>looking for Mock Turtles (remember the one in _Alice_ that sang:<br/>&quot;Soup of the evening, beautiful soup...&quot;?).</p></div><h3><a id=36386 href="#36386">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2002 2:53:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Mark G.
