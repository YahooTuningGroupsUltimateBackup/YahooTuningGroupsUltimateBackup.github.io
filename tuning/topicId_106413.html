If not, have you determined the source of the error? I see the following possibilities:<br/> 1) There is a problem with the sequence file<br/> 2) The sequence file is fine, but something went wrong during the midi conversion<br/> 3) The midi file is fine, but the player can&apos;t handle it</p><p> Have you tried to convert one of the example sequence files that are in the scala folder, like &quot;ex15.seq&quot;? They should be fine, so if it still doesn&apos;t work the problem is probably 2) or 3).</p><p> Can you play midi files, especially ones in a non-standard tuning? You can try this midi file in just intonation from the Sagittal notation homepage, for example:<br/> <a href="http://sagittal.org/exmp/ExmpJI.mid">http://sagittal.org/exmp/ExmpJI.mid</a> <a href="http://sagittal.org/exmp/ExmpJI.mid">http://sagittal.org/exmp/ExmpJI.mid</a><br/> (first download, then test with the music player you used for the other midi file)</p><p> Is it possible for you to test the midi file that didn&apos;t work in Ubuntu in a Windows OS?<br/> (make sure the file name is something Windows can handle, e.g. not &quot;*.mid&quot; with an actual asterisk)</p><p> You mentioned that the midi file &quot;does not play any sound&quot;. Can you be more specific? Do you get an error when trying to play it? Does it have zero length? Or does it play, but you don&apos;t hear anything? In the latter case, have you opened the midi file with a notation program and checked for a possible cause of the problem (no notes, note duration or volume = 0, or &quot;nothing seems wrong&quot;)?</p><p> - Geddy</p><p> P.S.: I successfully converted &quot;ex15.seq&quot; to a midi file in Ubuntu 14.04, and was able to play it using VLC, Totem or Rhythmbox.</p></div>
