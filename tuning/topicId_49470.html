The weak link in the chain is now the MIDI keyboard. If I<br/>were satisfied to use 12 notes per octave (tuned in some manner or<br/>other), my existing MIDI master keyboard would be just peachy, but I&apos;m<br/>not, so it&apos;s not.</p><p>My choices seem to be as follows:</p><p>1) Assign the tuning to my existing MIDI keyboard and try to keep my<br/>head from exploding while I keep track of the fingerings of various<br/>intervals. Been trying this. Pretty discouraging. Every time you want to<br/>add or subtract a pitch from the scale, your fingerings go all to heck.</p><p>2) Create 12-note subsets of the tuning, assign them to different MIDI<br/>channels, and put the piece of music together like a jigsaw puzzle,<br/>dovetailing phrases and individual notes on different channels in order<br/>to record a single phrase. Tried this with NI Reaktor. It&apos;s even more<br/>difficult.</p><p>3) Find a decent (and affordable) generalized keyboard with lots of keys<br/>and MIDI output.</p><p>4) Give up and go back to Csound.</p><p>Option 3 is lookin&apos; pretty good ... but I don&apos;t know of such a keyboard.<br/>Hence this message. I know Starr Labs makes a couple of generalized<br/>keyboards (the U990 and U648), but they ain&apos;t cheap. Has anyone in this<br/>group had any experience with these boards? Are they reliable<br/>mechanically? Are there other hardware options that I haven&apos;t stumbled<br/>onto yet?</p><p>Thanks most humbly for any leads you can provide!</p><p>--Jim Aikin (<a href="http://www.musicwords.net">www.musicwords.net</a>)</p></div><h3><a id=49494 href="#49494">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2003 10:33:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Option 3 is lookin&apos; pretty good ... but I don&apos;t know of such a keyboard.<br/>&gt;Hence this message.
