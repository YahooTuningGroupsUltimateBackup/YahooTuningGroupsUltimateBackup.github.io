That just shows us how far we have to go<br/>&gt;  in order to get traditional performers to do this stuff.  Johnny and I<br/>&gt;  don&apos;t even have a completed set of woodwind fingerings for 1/8 tones,<br/>&gt;  much less anything extremely exotic.  My presumption is that the<br/>&gt;  woodwinds are going to be about the hardest of all to &quot;convert&quot; just<br/>&gt;  because of all the fingering problems...</p><p>Actually, I asked Joseph to write in 48TET for the following reasons.<br/>1.

In fact, they may even be more reliable on woodwinds.  Any tuning<br/>can be played on any instrument.  only very few instruments are limited do to<br/>their construction design.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=10329 href="#10329">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>5/29/2000 7:11:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 5/29/00 7:52:58 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a><br/>writes:</p><p>&gt; Joseph, you are wrong to presume that any and all tunings are doable on<br/>&gt;  woodwinds.</p><p>Ooops, I mean you would be correct to presume that any and all tunings are<br/>doable on woodwinds.
