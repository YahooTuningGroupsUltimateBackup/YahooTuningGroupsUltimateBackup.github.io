Soon after that, Gene and Graham warned me that many of them had terribly high &quot;badnesses&quot; when taken in the particular full limit. So I tried to look at them more carefully and I decided to list the temperaments with the &quot;preferred&quot; partial limit.</p><p>The names are given in the same order as in message #101780. Temperaments which are not included here can be used in the way suggested in that message. The names marked with ** are the ones which I&apos;m now finding to be completely meaningless extensions of other lower limit temperaments. Those marked with (?) are names chosen to replace those which somehow took into account the excluded primes, like &quot;countdown&quot; instead of &quot;trisedoge&quot; and so on (I welcome any discussion of possible other names for these). The one marked with ! is one which, for some reason, I left out in that message although I was probably aware of the temperament (one line must have escaped me or whatever).</p><p>In my next post, I&apos;ll list unison vectors for a handful of other purely 5-limit temperaments, by no means as big a list as this one.</p><p>----------</p><p>Quinmite: 7</p><p>Lagaca: 5</p><p>Kastro: **</p><p>Whoops: <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a></p><p>Sesesix: 5</p><p>Undim: 5</p><p>Countdown(?): <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a>, formerly trisedoge</p><p>Zarvo: 7</p><p>Tertiosec(?): 5, formerly tertiomar</p><p>Quintosec(?): 5, formerly foneth</p><p>Misneb: <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a></p><p>Maquila: <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a></p><p>Discot: <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a></p><p>Untriton: **</p><p>Trimot: <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a></p><p>Semaja: <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a></p><p>Emka: 2.3.5.11.13</p><p>Lafa: 5</p><p>Sfourth: 5</p><p>Amavil: <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a></p><p>Oquatonic: 2.3.5.7.13</p><p>Restles: <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a></p><p>Tremka: 2.3.5.11.13</p><p>Vishnean: <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a></p><p>Fifives: <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a></p><p>Cotritone: 11</p><p>Ditonic: 2.3.5.11.13</p><p>Maja: <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a></p><p>Fasum: <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a></p><p>Coheschis: 2.3.5.7.13</p><p>Quartemka: 2.3.5.11.13</p><p>Metroci: 2.3.5.11.13</p><p>Gwazy: <a href="http://2.3.5.11">2.3.5.11</a></p><p>Aufo: 5</p><p>Majvam: <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a></p><p>Dodifo: <a href="http://2.3.5.13">2.3.5.13</a></p><p>!

Does this mean the &gt; corresponding temperaments should all have &gt; names?</p><p>Well, that&apos;s what I still don&apos;t understand -- where the boundaries are between what counts and what doesn&apos;t. For example, when Mike first mentioned the temperament which he was calling immunity and which I was calling semaphere/semephere, someone found it objectionable for exactly the same reason (i.e. too complex and too mistuned at the same time). But, on the other hand, 7-limit temperaments like lemba or dominant seem to be perfectly okay to be included, and so do 5-limit ones like father or bug or even something called enipucrop (1125/1024). To me this looks like a rather inconsistent way of making temperament lists because if we include temperaments like lemba or dominant, then we should probably also include the 7-limit temperament of 41&amp;37 which I haven&apos;t found mentioned anywhere so far. Honestly, I have tried at least 3 different ways of filtering and sorting and in all the cases, dominant seemed to stick out so much that when I wanted to include that, I also got a bunch of other temperaments which I didn&apos;t find worth including -- the same was even more apparent with those like muggles or flattone. And yet you might say that there is a point in including both muggles and flattone (or dominant). And if there are temperaments which are so remarcably in tune, does this mean that we should make a big gap in our list between the ones usable in practice and the ones used for theoretical purposes (without allowing the ones &quot;in-between&quot;)? Or does this mean that we should make two completely different lists, one of which includes temperaments like sesquiquartififths and another one which includes temperaments like dominant? Or, in the 5-limit, one which includes temperaments like whoosh and another one which includes temperaments like father?

If I should simply &quot;take dominant for granted&quot; because 12-equal supports it, then I could also play tetradic harmony in Pythagorean tuning and claim I&apos;m using it as dominant temperament. But (and there&apos;s the big but) then the 3rds are mistuned by ~21.5 cents, the 7ths are mistuned by ~27 cents, and at that moment I&apos;m unable to hear the &quot;5-limit-like flavor&quot; in the 3rds or the &quot;7-limit-like flavor&quot; in the 7thes. If a temperament spanning 6 generators for a 7/5 is mistuned as much as that, then the question now arises: Are we supposed to approximate the specified intervals recognizably enough when making music in these temperaments? Or do they only work as some theoretical framework explaining what interval sizes are similar to some others?
