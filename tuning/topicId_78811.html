I&rsquo;ve come up with a definition of consonance and a way to measure consonance. If you are deep into the study of just intonation and you like to scratch and think you will get a lot out of this cite. My material is all original and copyrighted. I would be very interested in knowing whether or not it is a published first. I can&rsquo;t imagine that it is a literal first in terms of who did it first. I know it was done before. It is a re-creation of the wheel, so to speak.</p></div>
