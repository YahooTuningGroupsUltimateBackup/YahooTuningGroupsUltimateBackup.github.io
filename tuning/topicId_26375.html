I basically have no experience<br/>in this new field.  I was wondering if any of you have any helpful<br/>suggestions.  I would greatly appreciate it.  I search for something<br/>which is pure and rare to find, it seems.  I have always known that<br/>there has been something missing in the &quot;music&quot; that I have heard<br/>throughout my life.

The real ratios<br/>are what truly matters.  There are ways to get around<br/>the &quot;modulation&quot; problem.  It is not difficult.

But if<br/>you don&apos;t mind tuning systems with large number of notes per octave, you<br/>might want to consider 72-note equal temperament (72-TET or 72-EDO, as it&apos;s<br/>called). 72-TET has all the advantages of an ET, while being so close to<br/>just tuning that it&apos;s hard to tell the difference.</p><p>A good introduction to 72-TET/-EDO is on Joe Monzo&apos;s page:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/72edo.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/72edo.htm</a></p><p>The biggest difficulty with 72-TET, if you want to play live music, is<br/>finding an instrument that can play all those notes. The Starr Labs Ztar<br/>looks like the best bet for a MIDI controller that can handle the notes<br/>(although I haven&apos;t used one, just heard about it on the list), but you&apos;ll<br/>also need a retunable instrument (synthesizer or sampler) that can handle<br/>that many notes. Since there are only 128 separate pitches on a single MIDI<br/>channel, you need to be able to use more than one MIDI channel if you want<br/>a good range.</p><p>That&apos;s a big difficulty with tuning systems that have so many notes per<br/>octave. Alternatively, you could try a continuous-pitch instrument like the<br/>trombone, bowed string instruments, or fretless guitar (even woodwinds can<br/>be persuaded to produce fine gradations in pitch, as Johnny Reinhard and<br/>others have demonstrated).</p><p>I should emphasize that 72-TET isn&apos;t the only tuning system of interest,<br/>and that a lot of good music can be done in other temperaments such as<br/>meantone, and many different flavors of JI. 31-TET (which is a meantone) is<br/>another good place to start exploring if you don&apos;t mind the slightly flat<br/>fifths. The natural harmonic series is another nice scale to play around<br/>with.</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   ---&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/index.html</a>&gt;--<br/>hmiller (Herman Miller)   &quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/io">@io</a>.com  email password: thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>\ &quot;Subject: teamouse&quot; /  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3>Justin White &#x3C;justin.white@davidjones.com.au&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2001 8:20:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Pagewizard,</p><p>I turned up on the tuning list in a similar position to yourself not really that<br/>long ago.</p><p>You will find that nearly everyone who offers you help will give you<br/>encouragement that is related to those areas they themselves are interested in.<br/>This is not a bad thing.
