I would<br/>very much like to read the quote from the &quot;dramatic&quot;  letter to Joseph<br/>Yasser [who has been surfacing, anyway, on the list of late...].  Is this<br/>somewhere in the digests and I missed it, or could someone find (or even<br/>paraphrase) it from another source?... I would appreciate it.  I love<br/>drama.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
