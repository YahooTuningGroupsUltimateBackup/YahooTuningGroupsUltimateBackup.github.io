A bit of topic for the tuning list, but I&apos;m curious.</p><p>Dear David, et al,</p><p>I have written to a south Indian friend who is an excellent Carnatic<br/>vina (veena) player (who also knows a lot about Hindustani classical<br/>music) asking for help answering this question.  If/when he replies I<br/>will forward his response, but in the meanwhile let me give my poor<br/>answer as interim reading material:</p><p>Carnatic music has been less influenced by external musical influences<br/>than Hindustani music has, since it was the northern part of India to<br/>which both invaders and traders from outside India first came.  This is<br/>the reason for at least some of the differences in the two systems.</p><p>Carnatic (South Indian) classical music differs from Hindustani (North<br/>Indian) classical music in many ways including the ways of constructing<br/>(and conceptualizing) scales (hence this is not completely off-topic for<br/>this list).  The two traditions have different ragas (roughly: modal<br/>structures), different talas (rhythmic cycles), and different song<br/>forms.  On the other hand, there are some similarities: for instance,<br/>some of the ragas are common to both systems (though often they go by<br/>different names), much of the Sanskrit-based terminology is common (or<br/>at least similar), etc.</p><p>Warning: from here on out I assume some knowledge of Hindustani music<br/>terminology...  :-)</p><p>While Hindustani ragas are often classified in a haphazard (IMHO) system<br/>of 10 thaats based on the set of notes used in the raga, Carnatic ragas<br/>are classified into a more precise system of 72 melakartas based on the<br/>combinations of upper and lower tetrachords used in the ragas.</p><p>In Hindustani music there are conceptually 7 base notes, with Re, Ga,<br/>Ma, Dha, and Ni having two forms, giving a total of 12 note names:<br/>Sa<br/>Komal Re<br/>Re<br/>Komal Ga<br/>Ga<br/>Ma<br/>Tivra Ma<br/>Pa<br/>Komal Dha<br/>Dha<br/>Komal Ni<br/>Ni<br/>---<br/>Sa</p><p>In Carnatic music, there are again conceptually 7 base notes, but while<br/>Ma can still have only two forms, Re, Ga, Dha, and Ni can have *three*<br/>forms, for a total of 16 forms, which actually map down to only 12<br/>distinct pitches:</p><p>Sa<br/>Ra<br/>Ri Ga<br/>Ru Gi<br/>Gu<br/>Ma<br/>Mi<br/>Pa<br/>Dha<br/>Dhi Na<br/>Dhu Ni<br/>Nu<br/>---<br/>Sa</p><p>For an example of why this is conceptually useful, this multiple-mapping<br/>nomenclature allows one to have two notes that in Hindustani terms would<br/>be &quot;komal re&quot; and &quot;re&quot; (&quot;shuddh re&quot;) in the same scale by calling them<br/>&quot;ra&quot; and &quot;ga&quot; and thus getting around the guideline of only one form of<br/>a given base note in a given scale.  :-)</p><p>With this system of notation (and the constraint of one form of each<br/>base note per scale), the lower tetrachord of a scale can have 12<br/>possible forms and the upper tetrachord of a scale can have six possible<br/>resulting in 72 possible melakarta.</p><p>I hope this was of interest.  If my friend writes more I&apos;ll be sure<br/>to forward it to the list.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Christopher</p></div>
