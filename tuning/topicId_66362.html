Do you think<br/>you could<br/>&gt; trace a bit of some history of the ideas which inspired you for<br/>this tuning?</p><p>Hi Petr,</p><p>The history goes back a long way.  When I first studied alternate<br/>tunings in the fall of 1963, I experimented with a retuned electronic<br/>organ, which I left in 1/4-comma meantone for several weeks.  When I<br/>put it back into 12-ET, I was shocked to find how badly it sounded,<br/>and ever since I have resolved to arrive at a temperament in which as<br/>many triads as possible sound like meantone, while having no triads<br/>with an unacceptable amount of error (e.g., no fifths tempered by<br/>more than 6 or 7 cents).  I came up with a temperament for this in<br/>1964, and a couple of improved versions in 1975.</p><p>I became interested in proportional-beating temperaments as a result<br/>of discussions in this group, and my first attempt in this direction<br/>was, I recall, a 19-tone circulating temperament in which 9 of the<br/>major triads had 1:1:1 beat ratios (cf. Erv Wilson&apos;s meta-meatone<br/>temperament).  Realizing that such triads would not be feasible in a<br/>circulating 12-tone temperament, I reasoned the next best thing might<br/>be major triads in which the 5th and major 3rd have the same beat<br/>rate (brat of 4), and it was no long afterward that I announced<br/>development of a 5/23-comma temperament (extra)ordinaire containing<br/>two such triads (with two more having brat of 2):<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/59999">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/59999</a></p><p>(In case you&apos;re not familiar with the term, &quot;brat&quot; (or breat-ratio)<br/>refers to the ratio between the beat-rates of the intervals in a<br/>major or minor triad.  When a single number is given, it is the one<br/>obtained by dividing the minor 3rd beat rate by that of the major<br/>3rd.)</p><p>A requirement in this (and all of my subsequent) temperaments (extra)<br/>ordinaires is that all of the major triads from Eb to E (i.e., the<br/>good ones in a usual 12-tone meantone tuning) have intonation not<br/>significantly worse than 12-ET.</p><p>After this point, Gene Ward Smith provided some very helpful<br/>direction by demonstrating how a temperament constructed with<br/>rational number will provide exact beat-rates, e.g.:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/61735">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/61735</a><br/>Gene also offered advice to use &quot;as many of the &apos;magic&apos; brats as<br/>possible; load up on 3/2 and 4, and fill in a gap with 2 or 3.&quot;<br/>(message #61804)</p><p>Around this time I was starting to pay attention to the brats for the<br/>minor triads as well as the major triads.  In the course of<br/>attempting to construct a new (extra)ordinaire with less error in the<br/>most consonant triads, I found that a brat of 9 (corresponding to<br/>5/21-comma meantone, which has M3:5th and 5th:m3 beat ratios of 1:3),<br/>also has a nice brat value of 5 for the minor triads.  See:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/13651">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/13651</a></p><p>This idea was finalized in my 1/4-comma temperament (extra)ordinaire<br/>on 5 February of this year, but I didn&apos;t post it here until this<br/>month:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/66222">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/66222</a><br/>Although it has the 5/21-comma brats of 9 (exact) on the C and G<br/>major triads, the narrowest fifths are tempered approximately 1/4-<br/>comma.  It also has very nice (exact) major brats on D (4), E (2), F<br/>(2), Bb (1.5), A (2.75), and Eb (1.2).  There are exact minor brats<br/>on A (7), E (5), and Bb (1), and close approximations on B (2) and F#<br/>(4/3).</p><p>&gt; Some time ago, I was keen on making proportionally beating quasi-<br/>meantone<br/>&gt; tunings and partly I am until now. If you were interested in my<br/>systems, you<br/>&gt; can tell me.</p><p>Yes, I noticed this around the time that you posed it:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/62320">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/62320</a><br/>I didn&apos;t respond because I haven&apos;t had a lot of time to spare lately,<br/>and I am more interested in circulating temperaments.</p><p>&gt; Thank you in advance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Petr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PS: Is it true that the ideal case is if C4 = 258Hz? If so, maybe<br/>it could<br/>&gt; be added to the description or one of the comment lines.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand why any particular frequency should be an &quot;ideal<br/>case&quot;.  The ratios between the beats don&apos;t change when you change the<br/>reference frequency.  Umm, wait a minute; perhaps you&apos;re thinking of<br/>counting beats when tuning by ear, in which case 258 gives a C-G beat<br/>rate of exactly 2 Hz (and also for A-E in my 1/4-comma TX, where C#-<br/>G# is exactly 1/2).  Nice!  (But it makes A=431.55555..., which is<br/>somewhat lower in pitch than what we&apos;re accustomed to.)</p><p>Best,</p><p>--George</p></div>
