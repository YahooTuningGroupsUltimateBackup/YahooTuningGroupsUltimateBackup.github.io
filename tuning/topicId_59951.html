My point is that when actual music is done, cooked,<br/>packaged and delivered, there is still an inertia of not changing a point of view.<br/>And just as often there are charges of not experimenting, or &quot;paper<br/>temperament&quot; readings, or pot luck.  In the democracy of tuning, anything goes.</p><p>But I think from of a different perspective.  I have to do a concert with<br/>Bach&apos;s Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor.  Do I go with the Werckmeister III<br/>that is historically accurate and feels right, even though there is a<br/>panapoly of different holy grails among moderns.</p><p>In other words, is there a better tuning than Werckmeister III for doing a<br/>Brandenburg.  No one has done them, to my knowledge (except unrecorded<br/>performance initiated by Brad Lehman).</p><p>Audiences today cannot all tell that the music is in Werckmeister III, they<br/>just like it.  And yet, all the suggestions for alternatives craved by various<br/>supporters are less &quot;microtonally&quot; different from 12-tone equal temperament.<br/>Why would I want to change things?</p><p>best, Johnny</p></div>
