Thanks to Paul Erlich for pointing out the problem, and giving<br/>me the opportunity to clarify not only the numbers but the basic<br/>concept involved.</p><p>[My earlier statement]</p><p>&gt;&gt; or as a tempering of 121:143:181 or 121:154:181,<br/>&gt;&gt; with a pure 14:11 major third and 13:11 minor third joined to form a<br/>&gt;&gt; fifth at 196:121, or about 706.72 cents (~4.76 cents wider than pure).</p><p>[Paul&apos;s response]</p><p>&gt; Hmm . . . the outer interval of those chords is 181:121, or 697.18 cents,<br/>&gt; and 196:121 is 835.02 cents.</p><p>Here what I am describing is a sonority combining a pure 14:11 major<br/>third (~417.51 cents) and a pure 13:11 minor third (~289.21 cents,<br/>resulting in a fifth of 182:121, or ~706.72 cents.</p><p>As you can say, although I got the size of the 182:181 correct, I<br/>mistyped the ratio itself no less than three times. I should have<br/>given 121:143:182 (13:11 below 14:11) and 121:154:182 (14:11 below<br/>13:11), but in both cases typed &quot;182&quot; instead of &quot;181.&quot;</p><p>The third time I typed &quot;196:121,&quot; a slip of the keyboard maybe<br/>stemming from the distraction of a different ratio in the tuning, the<br/>diminished fourth at 121:98 (~364.98 cents, close to 21:17), whose<br/>octave complement is an augmented fifth at 196:121, indeed 835.02<br/>cents just as Paul observes.</p><p>Now that I&apos;ve clarified that we&apos;re dealing with the situation of a<br/>sonority ideally combining a pure 13:11 and pure 14:11, and thus<br/>producing a fifth not at 3:2 but at 182:121 (~4.76 cents wide), maybe<br/>I can more clearly state the point I meant to raise.</p><p>Even with such techniques as adaptive tuning, there is no way to make<br/>a 13:11 and a 14:11 add up to a pure 3:2. One might say that the laws<br/>of mathematics themselves &quot;temper&quot; the fifth.</p><p>In my article on the 17-note well-temperament, I was suggesting that<br/>the actual tuning of these intervals in the &quot;nearer&quot; 12-note range of<br/>the temperament (Eb-G#) could be seen as a kind of variation on this<br/>tuning in which the 13:11 is slightly compromised but the fifth is<br/>actually brought closer to pure.</p><p>Over the range of Eb-G#, this tuning is identical what I term a<br/>regular hypermeantone with pure 14:11 major thirds. In other words,<br/>fifths are tuned so that four of them form a 14:11, calling for a<br/>temperament of ~2.422 cents in the wide direction. Compare this with<br/>the ~4.72 cents of &quot;virtual temperament&quot; in the 182:121 (as compared<br/>to a pure 3:2) which the pure 13:11 and 14:11 together would produce.</p><p>The following diagram may help to show the difference:</p><p>All integer ratios (121:143:182)           14:11 hypermeantone</p><p>        |  B3                             |  B3<br/>182:121 |     14:11 (~417.51)             |     14:11 (~417.51)<br/>~706.72 |  G3                    ~704.377 |  G3<br/> ~+4.76 |     13:11 (~289.21)      ~+2.42 |     ~286.87 (-~2.34)<br/>        |  E3                             |  E3</p><p>In the just tuning, the full burden of &quot;virtual temperament&quot; falls on<br/>the fifth, maybe somewhat ironically in a musical context where fifths<br/>are prime concords and thirds are unstable although _relatively_<br/>&quot;concordant.&quot; In the tempered version, the burden gets about equally<br/>divided between the wide fifth (slightly wider than 3:2) and the minor<br/>third (slightly narrower than 13:11).</p><p>Thus if one wishes to combine 3:2, 14:11, and 13:11 in a single<br/>sonority -- and I&apos;m not sure how widespread such a concept may be -- a<br/>14:11 hypermeantone tuning just might be, in effect, one of the<br/>closest approaches to &quot;adaptive tuning,&quot; giving the inherent<br/>incommensurability of these three ratios together.</p><p>Incidentally, I should add that my musical approach is guided mostly by<br/>the &quot;grammar&quot; of Gothic sonorities and progressions; in such a setting,<br/>the ratios 14:11 and 13:11 seem to me mathematically noble and also<br/>musically beautiful and intriguing, attracting me to the idea of<br/>sonorities uniting both -- or their close approximations.</p><p>P.S. As long as we&apos;re addressing corrections in my well-temperament<br/>post, I should also note that my statement of the tempering of the<br/>fifth as ~2.421 cents represents a truncation rather than a correct<br/>rounding of the result given by GNU Emacs Calc, properly ~2.422<br/>cents.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
