The information below, provided<br/>thanks to Daniel Wolf, has now been proved wrong through the series of posts<br/>that have followed since it was first posted.</p><p>&gt;  From the Brockhaus Riemann Musik Lexikon:  &quot;Seine (Werckmeisters)<br/>&gt;  Erfahrungen<br/>&gt;  und Kenntnisse al Orgelpr&#xFFFD;fer legte er in der _Orgel-Probe_ (Ffm. u. Lpz.<br/>&gt;  1681, erw. Quendlinburg 1698) nieder. In _musikalische Temperatur_ (Ffm.<br/>u.<br/>&gt;  Lpz. 1686/87) beschreibt er f&#xFFFD;nf Temperierungen, die durch Verteilung des<br/>&gt;  pythagoreischen Kommas entstehen; ein gleichschwebende Temperierung ist<br/>&gt;  zuerst in den _Hypomnemata musica oder musicalisches Memorial_<br/>(Quedlinburg<br/>&gt;  1697) erw&#xFFFD;hnt.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>We know now that _Hypomnemata..._ does not endorse ET, but favors the<br/>irregular circle.  As well, the _Orgel-Probe_ also does not endorse ET.</p><p>As Manuel has said there is still a posthumously published work, _Paradoxical<br/>Discourse_, which no one on the list has read, but which Mark Lindley in the<br/>Groves believes inadequate to indicate a full reversal of Werckmeister&apos;s<br/>opinion to later in life favor ET.</p><p>After reading Kirnberger, who studied with J.S. Bach during Bach writing Book<br/>II of the Well-Tempered Clavier, I now believe the specific and no longer<br/>accept the general approach.</p><p>The general approach here is to continue hearsay, and to encourage wishful<br/>thinking onto different ideologies and/or aesthetics.  I started this thread<br/>at the top of 2000 to try to put to rest suspicion that Andreas Werckmeister<br/>favored ET by the end of his life.  On the strictly human level, there is too<br/>much ego at stake for Werckmeister to switch from his own originality and to<br/>deny his ears only in a publication printed after his death.  It smells wrong.</p><p>Here, a generalist approach is the wrong approach.  The terminology, itself,<br/>is explosive.  For example, Meantone (Werckmeister&apos;s &quot;Praetorian&quot;) is &quot;equal<br/>temperament&quot; in that the diatonic scales are identical to each other, and the<br/>major third is spit into 2 equal whole steps.  However, each key does not<br/>play &quot;equally&quot; identical, requiring &quot;subsemitonium&quot; or split keys for more<br/>than 7 major and 2 minor keys.</p><p>Now, Werckmeister III is &quot;equal temperament&quot; for the fact that each of 12<br/>major and minor keys can be used equally well.  For W. to describe for the<br/>first time in history of full circle of keys, is for him to be confused with<br/>a supporter of ET.  Additionally, there were those pushing for identical<br/>scales who pressured W. to reassess his point of view.  W. allowed 12TET with<br/>increasing frequency, consistent with a tolerant acceptance of different<br/>irregular temperaments.  No where did W. claim them as his own invention, but<br/>that they were already current by the best composers of his day.</p><p>Politics has always been a part of human history, and it was no less true in<br/>1706.  The noble brown nosing and the sensitivity to criticism expressed by<br/>W. in his writings is enough to recognize extreme conditions.  W. merely is<br/>trying to keep from being skinned alive.  The Marpurg and Kirnberger wars are<br/>the extent to which W.&apos;s irregular preferences were active.  It is no more a<br/>cul-de-sac than any other phase of music.  It is significant that Kirnberger<br/>does not mention Werckmeister at all in his &quot;Art of Strict Composition&quot; which<br/>details harmonic theory with an irregular bias, all in the service of his<br/>teacher, J.S. Bach.</p><p>If one&apos;s modern aesthetic does not allow for listening to Bach in<br/>Werckmeister III (thank you John Sankey, Ton Koopman, Igor Kipnis, Pertis),<br/>than that is your wont.  Hell, some wonderful people can&apos;t match pitch;<br/>others have perfect pitch that interferes with their reception of<br/>irregularity with no absolute pitch concerns.</p><p>For those that &quot;hear the difference&quot; in the a Werckmeister III-tuned<br/>&quot;Chromatic Fantasy&quot; by Bach will know what I am talking about.  What a shame<br/>that the musicology world never thought it important enough to translate a<br/>single published work of Werckmeister (except the early _Orgel-Probe_).  This<br/>is a major reason why I do not trust the generalist approach to music<br/>history.  It is dishonest to the truth, in one sense, that these works are<br/>only in Thuringian dialect, and rare to find at that.  It almost seems a<br/>conspiracy of later times to &quot;tell Werckmeister&apos;s story&quot; and keep W. silent,<br/>and ultimately misrepresented.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2000 9:17:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Johnny Reinhard:</p><p>There is an unfortunate tendency to believe that if something is not<br/>translated into English then it simply doesn&apos;t exist.

The entry<br/>for Werckmeister is not initialed, but it is reasonable to assume that<br/>Eggebrecht, author of _Die Orgelbewegung_ (1967) was the author. (The German<br/>&quot;organ movement&quot; has been an attempt in the 20th century to restore the<br/>sound of the pre-romantic organ, encompassing all elements of instrument<br/>construction and performance practice).</p><p>Within the _Orgelbewegung_, the  question of Werckmeister&apos;s possible<br/>advocacy or dismissal of ET has been an important and, indeed, controversial<br/>one.  The record is clear only in that he first mentions a _gleichschwebende<br/>Temperierung_ (ET, but literally &quot;equal beating temperament&quot;) in the<br/>_Hyponemata..._ of 1697, the second (1698) edition of  the _Orgel-Probe_<br/>eliminates the unequal tunings mentioned in the first edition and 1698&apos;s<br/>_Die nothwendigsten Anmerckungen und Regeln wie der Bassus continuus..._<br/>gives instructions for only two tunings, ET, and an easier-to-tune<br/>approximate ET.   This absence of unequal tunings in the 1698 publications<br/>has to be resolved before any claim can be resolved;  I suspect that this is<br/>impossible.</p><p>Finally, in the _Musicalische Paradoxal-Discourse_ of 1707 that we encounter<br/>the controversial sentence:</p><p>&quot;Indessen bin ich doch nicht ungeneigt / und bleibe dabey / dass man die<br/>diatonischen Tertian etwas reiner lasse / als die andern so man selten<br/>gebraucht / es giebet auch gute Ver&#xFFFD;nderung&quot;.  (In this I am indeed not<br/>disinclined / and maintain / that one leaves the diatonic thirds somewhat<br/>purer / as the others that one seldom uses / it (this method of tuning) also<br/>yields good (chromatic) alterations.&quot;)</p><p>It&apos;s just not possible to say whether Werckmeister thought one _could_ leave<br/>the diatonic thirds purer or one _should_ leave them purer!</p><p>Kelletat (whose work is excellent, but focused on later generations,<br/>especially Kirnberger, deals with Werckmeister only in passing) takes a<br/>position similar to that of Reinhard but does not mention any of<br/>Werckmeister&apos;s  publications between 1691 and 1707. The consensus reading<br/>(represented by Raasch) interprets the above as indicating that Werckmeister<br/>had made the theoretical advance to advocating ET in the intervening<br/>publications but was not, in fact, able to implement it in his own practice.<br/>Indeed, one can detect a sense of resignation in the tone of his late<br/>writings.</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
