Proximal triples: The &quot;split fifth&quot; and 17-flavor cadences<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Another subset of the most proximal quad produces a milder variety of<br/>triple described by Jacobus of Liege around 1325 as a _quinta fissa_<br/>or &quot;split fifth&quot;: an outer fifth divided by the middle voice into the<br/>unstable but relatively blending intervals of a major third and minor<br/>third. Jacobus expresses a preference for the arrangement with the<br/>major third below and the minor third above (e.g. G3-B3-D4), but cites<br/>a motet (happily preserved in the Bamberg and Montpellier Codices)<br/>with an opening sonority of A3-C4-E4 to demonstrate that the converse<br/>arrangement is also acceptable.[13]</p><p>Either variety of _quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth,&quot; as we may<br/>conveniently term it in English, is open to three varieties of<br/>directed cadential progressions involving resolutions of both unstable<br/>thirds by stepwise contrary motion: intensive (ascending semitonal<br/>motion), remissive (descending semitonal motion), and omnitonal<br/>(whole-tone motion in all voices). Here are these three resolutions<br/>for G3-B3-D4:</p><p>  Intensive            Remissive           Omnitonal</p><p>   D4  C4               D4  C#4             D4  E4<br/>   B3  C4               B3  C#4             B3  A3<br/>   G3  F3               G3  F#3             G3  A3</p><p>(M3-5 + m3-1)        (M3-5 + m3-1)       (M3-1 + m3-5)</p><p>Similarly, the form with the minor third below and major third above<br/>is open to these three resolutions:</p><p>  Intensive            Remissive           Omnitonal</p><p>   E4  F4               E4  F#4             E4  D4<br/>   C4  Bb3              C4  B3              C4  D4<br/>   A3  Bb3              A3  B3              A3  G3</p><p>(m3-1 + M3-5)        (m3-1 + M3-5)       (m3-5 + M3-1)</p><p>In practice, the availability of all three resolutions in these<br/>regularly spelled forms assumes a tuning set including any required<br/>accidentals: for the above examples, as it happens, a typical 12-note<br/>set of Eb-G# in any regular neo-Gothic tuning would suffice.</p><p>With its ideally euphonious fifth and two relatively blending thirds,<br/>the _quinta fissa_ or split fifth is one of the mildest unstable<br/>sonorities in Gothic or neo-Gothic music[14], often inviting free<br/>&quot;coloristic&quot; treatments as well as directed cadential resolutions.</p><p>------------------------------------------------<br/>5.1.

In early 15th-century and derivative styles, 5-flavor<br/>versions of the &quot;split fifth&quot; serve as smooth and beguiling<br/>noncadential points of diversion or pausing, and sometimes also in<br/>cadential resolutions. Neutral or 49-flavor thirds occur as augmented<br/>seconds or diminished fourths in regular tunings with fifths in the<br/>range of around 705-706.5 cents, with 17-tET (fifths ~705.88 cents) in<br/>the center of this region.</p><p>Additionally, a characteristic neo-Gothic treatment of 5-flavor split<br/>fifths in various tunings where they occur (e.g. Pythagorean, Noble<br/>Fifth, 22-tET) is to use them as antepenultimate cadential sonorities,<br/>with one of the voices moving by a comma or diesis or the like to a<br/>more active flavor of split fifth which then resolves in a usual<br/>manner. This idiom invites discussion in coming articles.</p><p>Focusing on the remaining flavors of split fifths most typically<br/>receiving direct cadential resolutions, we might approach these in two<br/>groups. Split fifths in the range from the 3-flavor to the 13-flavor<br/>invite efficient &quot;closest approach&quot; resolutions or more stately<br/>omnitonal resolutions much like those for full proximate quads or<br/>other types of proximate triples (see Parts 2A and 2B); no radically<br/>new principles are involved.</p><p>Additionally, some of the most characteristic neo-Gothic tunings<br/>feature 17-flavor versions of the split fifth with submajor thirds at<br/>around 21:17 and supraminor thirds at around 17:14, with a distinctive<br/>kind of cadential resolution involving strikingly large chromatic<br/>semitones in the neighborhood of 14:13 (~128.30 cents). These<br/>17-flavor cadences are a distinctive mark of neo-Gothic as opposed to<br/>known historical medieval practice and theory.</p><p>Let us first briefly survey some resolutions along the familiar<br/>portion of the spectrum from the 3-flavor to the 13-flavor, and then<br/>the distinctive 17-flavor.</p><p>-----------------------------------------<br/>5.1.1. From the 3-flavor to the 13-flavor<br/>-----------------------------------------</p><p>As we have seen, either basic arrangement of the split fifth (with the<br/>major third below and minor third above, or the converse) permits<br/>three types of resolutions: intensive, remissive, or omnitonal.

To illustrate this theme, we<br/>consider three diverse flavors of cadences from a single tuning<br/>system, the e-based tuning devised in honor of Leonhard Euler.</p><p>We focus on the form of split fifth cadence especially inviting such<br/>diversity: the version with the minor third of the split fifth placed<br/>below the major third, with an intensive or remissive resolution<br/>involving some variety of semitonal melodic motion.</p><p>With a fifth of around 704.61 cents (~2.65 cents wide), this tuning<br/>features regular or native 11-flavor cadences with major thirds<br/>(~418.42 cents) slightly wider than 14:11, and minor thirds (~286.18<br/>cents) somewhat narrower than 13:11, and closer to 33:28 (~284.44<br/>cents). The regular whole-tone is around 209.21 cents, and the<br/>diatonic semitone around 76.97 cents, these two intervals having the<br/>defining ratio of Euler&apos;s _e_.</p><p>                         e-based -- 11-flavor</p><p>              Intensive                             Remissive</p><p>     B3 ------  +77 ----- C4               B3 ----- +209 ----- C#4<br/>    (418)                (705)            (418)               (705)<br/>     G3 ------ -209 ----- F3               G3 -----  -77 ----- F#3<br/>  (705,286)             (705,0)         (704,286)            (705,0)<br/>     E3 ------  +77 ----- F3               E3 ----- +209 ----- F#3</p><p>           (m3-1 + M3-5)                        (m3-1 + M3-5)</p><p>In contrast to these usual closest approach progressions, the<br/>chromatic 17-flavor resolutions involve chromatic semitones at around<br/>132.25 cents, and submajor and supraminor thirds at around 363.14 and<br/>341.46 cents, respectively about 2.68 cents smaller than 21:17 and<br/>5.33 cents larger than 17:14.</p><p>                         e-based -- 17-flavor</p><p>              Intensive                             Remissive</p><p>     Bb3 ------ +132 ----- B3               Bb3 ----- +209 ----- C4<br/>    (363)                (705)             (363)                (705)<br/>     F#3 ------ -208 ----- E3               F#3 ----- -132 ----- F3<br/>  (705,341)             (705,0)          (704,341)             (704,0)<br/>     Eb3 ------ +132 ----- E3               Eb3 ----- +209 ----- F3</p><p>          (Aug2-1 + dim4-5)                     (Aug2-1 + dim4-5)</p><p>Here the difference between the diatonic and chromatic semitones is<br/>around 55.28 cents, a measure of the contrast between these 17-flavor<br/>progressions and the usual 11-flavor ones. The submajor and supraminor<br/>thirds differ in size by around 21.68 cents. If we moved much further<br/>along the spectrum of regular tunings toward larger fifths, these<br/>thirds would approach the equal and neutral 49-flavor condition of the<br/>17-tET neighborhood.</p><p>This variety of 17-flavor leaning somewhat toward neutrality is known<br/>as &quot;strong,&quot; in contrast to the &quot;mild&quot; 17-flavor of 29-tET and the<br/>&quot;central&quot; or medium flavor found with fifths close to 704 cents<br/>(e.g. the Noble Fifth tuning, Section 5.1.2) where thirds are at or<br/>quite near the characteristic ratios of 21:17 and 17:14.[19]</p><p>In addition, the e-based tuning when carried to 24 notes per octave<br/>offers superefficient 7-flavor resolutions with wide major thirds and<br/>narrow minor thirds formed from 13 fourths up (~440.11 cents) and 14<br/>fifths up (~264.50 cents) -- spelled respectively as a fourth minus a<br/>55-cent diesis and a major second plus this diesis.</p><p>In a 24-note tuning on two 12-note keyboards a diesis apart, taking<br/>the lower keyboard as the &quot;standard&quot; one, and using the * symbol to<br/>show notes on the upper keyboard (raised by a diesis), we might play<br/>and notate our sample resolutions as follows:</p><p>                           e-based -- 7-flavor</p><p>              Intensive                              Remissive</p><p>     B3   ------  +55 ----- B*3             B3   ----- +209 ----- C#4<br/>    (440)                  (705)           (440)                 (705)<br/>     F#*3 ------ -209 ----- E*3             F#*3 -----  -55 ----- F#3<br/>  (705,264)               (705,0)        (705,264)              (705,0)<br/>     E3   ------  +55 ----- E*3             E3   ----- +209 ----- F#3</p><p>             (m3-1 + M3-5)                         (m3-1 + M3-5)</p><p>The 7-flavor split fifth is quite close to 6:7:9, with superefficient<br/>resolutions involving melodic motions by a 55-cent diesis, here E3-E*3<br/>and B3-B*3 (intensive), or F#*3-F#3 (remissive). The other voice in a<br/>two-voice resolution of m3-1 or M3-5 moves by a usual whole-tone of<br/>around 209 cents, for a total expansion or contraction of 264 cents,<br/>equal to the size of the 7-flavor minor third in this tuning.[20]</p><p>In this near-6:7:9 sonority, the outer fifth is ~2.65 cents wide; the<br/>lower minor third only ~2.37 cents smaller than 7:6; and the upper<br/>major third wider than 9:7 by a greater variance of ~5.03 cents.</p><p>It seems especially fitting that a tuning based on Euler&apos;s _e_ should<br/>include a 7-flavor with a near-pure approximation of 7:6, since<br/>Leonhard Euler (1764) describes the 7-based ratios 7:4 and 7:6, and<br/>advocates their use in practical music, as documented in a brilliant<br/>translation by Joe Monzo of a of a fascinating paper in French by<br/>Patrice Bailhache on Euler&apos;s music theory, complete with Monzo&apos;s<br/>alternative translations and commentary on Euler&apos;s original Latin:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm</a></p><p>In neo-Gothic theory, a 7-flavor split fifth at or near 6:7:9 is<br/>called the _quinta fissa suavis_, the &quot;agreeable&quot; or &quot;attractive&quot;<br/>split fifth -- or, more freely, the &quot;smooth&quot; or &quot;sweet&quot; split fifth.<br/>This name is in honor of Euler and his _gradus suavitatis_ or &quot;degree<br/>of attraction&quot; (Monzo&apos;s artful translation) of a sonority.[21]</p><p>In surveying the e-based tuning, we have considered only intensive or<br/>remissive resolutions of split fifth sonorities with the minor third<br/>below and the major third above, the situation especially lending<br/>itself to intonational variations. The following table may offer an<br/>overview of the diversity we have encountered even within this limited<br/>scope: the regular 11-flavor, chromatic 17-flavor, and streamlined<br/>7-flavor.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  Flavor    Ratio zone    e-based tuning     Size of       Steps<br/>              M3   m3       (1-m3-5)         upper M3     T     S<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>11-flavor   14:11 13:11   0-286.18-704.61    418.42    209.21  76.97<br/>17-flavor   21:17 17:14   0-341.46-704.61    363.14    209.21 132.25<br/> 7-flavor    9:7   7:6    0-264.50-704-61    440.11    209.21  55.28<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Total motion in m3-1 or M3-5 equals size of cadential m3, or (T + S)<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In these cadences, minor thirds vary in size from around 264 cents to<br/>341 cents, and major thirds likewise from 363 to 440 cents -- a range<br/>equal to the size of a full diatonic semitone in this tuning, or<br/>around 77 cents. Yet each version is recognizable as a variation on<br/>the basic theme of a split fifth resolving (m3-1 + M3-5).</p><p>As it happens, I originally hit upon the idea of the e-based tuning by<br/>a kind of serendipity: if other people had based tunings on such<br/>arbitrary mathematical quantities as pi or the Golden Section, why not<br/>Euler&apos;s _e_?</p><p>However, the tuning illustrates the delicate kind of intonational<br/>balance which can give such a system a special quality. Here we have<br/>the distinctive combination of an 11-flavor with major thirds within<br/>one cent of 14:11; a 17-flavor where submajor and supraminor thirds<br/>retain enough difference in size to give a sense of contrast or<br/>&quot;polarity&quot; rather than even neutrality[22]; and a near-pure 7-flavor (with<br/>a close approximation of 7:6 and a virtually just 7:4).</p><p>If the fifth (~704.61 cents) were slightly larger, then the 17-flavor<br/>would approach a neutral 49-flavor as in 17-tET; if it were slightly<br/>smaller, then the 7-flavor would be considerably less accurate in<br/>approximating ratios such as 7:6 and 7:4.</p><p>Of course, _any_ point on the neo-Gothic spectrum will offer its own<br/>unique balances and opportunities; these articles are meant to suggest<br/>a few possibilities and to encourage further exploration.</p><p>----------------<br/>Notes to Part 2C<br/>----------------</p><p>13. We can derive the first variety of _quinta fissa_ or split fifth<br/>from the lowest three notes of an expansive most proximal quad,<br/>e.g. G3-B3-D4-E4; and the second variety from the lowest three notes<br/>of a contractive most proximal quad, e.g. A3-C4-E4-G4. Various<br/>derivations from other types of proximal quads are also possible,<br/>e.g. G3-B3-D4 from the contractive most proximal quad E3-G3-B3-D4; or<br/>A3-C4-E4 from the omnitonal quad A3-C4-E4-F4.</p><p>14. The other category of mildly unstable or relatively blending<br/>three-voice sonorities features combinations with two ideally<br/>euphonious fifths and/or fourths plus a relatively tense major second<br/>or ninth or a minor seventh. Examples of these &quot;mildly unstable<br/>quintal/quartal sonorities&quot; include G3-D4-A4 (M9 + 5 + 5); G3-C4-F4<br/>(m7 + 4 + 4); G3-C4-D4 (5 + 4 + M2); and G3-A3-D4 (5 + M2 + 4). While<br/>these sonorities are very important in Gothic and neo-Gothic music,<br/>they are not _proximal_ triples capable of resolving to stability by<br/>way of _stepwise_ motion in all voices, and we therefore reserve them<br/>for later discussion.</p><p>15. In choosing 49:40 (~351.34 cents) rather than the simpler 11:9<br/>(~347.41 cents) as a ratio representing the zone of neutral thirds, I<br/>am motivated in part by the closer approximation of the former<br/>interval to an equal division of the fifth in regular neo-Gothic<br/>tunings where neutral thirds are most characteristic (fifths in the<br/>neighborhood of 706 cents). In 17-tET, an ideal example, we have a<br/>precisely equal division of the fifth at 10/17 octave (~705.88 cents)<br/>into two neutral thirds of 5/17 octave (~352.94 cents). In contrast,<br/>for a meantone temperament such as 31-tET, 11:9 closely approximates<br/>an equal division of the fifth, e.g. 9/31 octave (~348.39 cents) as<br/>precisely half of a fifth at 18/31 octave (~696.77 cents).</p><p>16. With a 24-note Pythagorean tuning mapped to two 12-note keyboards<br/>a Pythagorean comma apart (the Xeno-Gothic scheme), taking the lower<br/>keyboard as the standard one, these progressions would be spelled<br/>A^3-C4-E^3 to Bb3-Bb3-F4, and A^3-C4-E^4 to B^3-B^3-F#^4.</p><p>17. With a 24-note subset of 29-tET mapped to two 12-note keyboards a<br/>diesis apart, taking the lower keyboard as standard, these<br/>progressions would be spelled A*3-C4-E*4 to Bb3-Bb3-F4, and A*3-C4-E*4<br/>to B*3-B*3-F*4.</p><p>18. In 29-tET, 17-flavor submajor and supraminor thirds have sizes of<br/>9/29 octave (~372.41 cents) and 8/29 octave (~331.03 cents); in the<br/>e-based tuning, they are ~363.14 cents and ~341.46 cents. These<br/>relatively complex and somewhat polarized thirds represent a region<br/>between the smooth 5-flavor augmented seconds and diminished fourths<br/>(&quot;schisma thirds&quot;) of Pythagorean tuning and its immediate neighbors,<br/>and the equal or near-equal neutral thirds of the 49-flavor around<br/>17-tET.</p><p>19. One rough guide for placing a transitional region between<br/>17-flavor and 49-flavor zones might propose that submajor and<br/>supraminor thirds should differ by a ratio of at least something like<br/>85:84 (~20.49 cents). This would place the area of transition just<br/>beyond the e-based tuning. While 85:84 is merely one intuitive<br/>&quot;guesstimate&quot; for such a guide, this ratio may have the appeal of<br/>defining the difference between a 21:17 or 17:14 third and the<br/>simplest ratios for major and minor thirds of 5:4 and 6:5<br/>respectively.</p><p>20. The ~55.28-cent diesis of these progressions is curiously very<br/>close to the regular diatonic semitone of 22-tET (1/22 octave, ~54.55<br/>cents), where the 7-flavor is the usual or native flavor.</p><p>21. On the question of translating the Latin _suavis_ (and the noun<br/>_suavitas_, &quot;agreeableness&quot; or &quot;pleasantness,&quot; or &quot;attraction&quot;), see<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm</a>. Most<br/>remarkably, one might add, the 7-flavor of our e-based tuning features<br/>a virtually pure 7:4 of 15 fifths up -- a regular major sixth plus<br/>diesis -- of (~913.82 + ~55.28) or 969.10 cents, only ~0.28 cents wide<br/>of a just 7:4 at ~968.83 cents. While Euler proposes an intonation of<br/>the 18th-century dominant seventh sonority at 36:45:54:63 or 4:5:6:7,<br/>a Neo-Gothic most proximate triple in the e-based 7-flavor such as<br/>E3-B3-C#*4 (roughly 0-264.50-969.10 cents) resolving intensively to<br/>E*3-B*3-B*3 or remissively to F#3-C#4-C#4 (m7-5 + m3-1), nicely<br/>illustrates a near-pure 4:6:7 in a neo-medieval setting.</p><p>22. At around 341.46 cents, the e-based augmented second is very<br/>slightly closer to 17:14 (~5.33 cents wide) than to 11:9 (~5.94 cents<br/>narrow), and interestingly close to 28:23 (~340.55 cents), possibly<br/>marking roughly the zone of transition from a &quot;supraminor third&quot; to a<br/>more neutral quality. In the context of the 17-flavor split fifth,<br/>this interval may take on more of a supraminor quality by contrast<br/>with the submajor third (diminished fourth) at ~363.14 cents, only<br/>~2.68 cents narrow of 21:17. Please let me thank Jacky Ligon, who in a<br/>different context mentioned using 28:23 (personal communication), thus<br/>bringing to my attention what proved to be a nice approximation of the<br/>augmented second or 17-flavor supraminor third in the e-based tuning.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=16136 href="#16136">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/1/2000 10:50:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, &quot;M.
