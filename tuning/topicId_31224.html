This already requires a<br/>little explanation. 13/72?? What happens is that 13/72 has generator<br/>mappings which are exactly five times further out than 7/72, so my<br/>sytem decides 13/72 is a sort of occult version of Miracle, and<br/>classifies it there.</p><p>I previously discussed 46+26, with generator 22/72; the associated<br/>linear temperament scores 652. 50+22 with generator 26/72 is well in<br/>the back at 2833, and 53+19 with generator 19/72 (kleismic) is<br/>looking good at 293.</p><p>However the above list suggests we look at 29/72, which scores 548,<br/>and 35/72, which scores 443, and 9/72, 15/72 or 33/72, with a score<br/>of 651.</p><p>We have 2/5 &lt; 29/72 &lt; 27/67, and so 29/72 is the 67+5 system. The<br/>mapping to primes is</p><p>[  0  1]<br/>[-6   4]<br/>[-29 14]<br/>[  2  2]</p><p>It favors 3 and 7 at the expense of 5.</p><p>For 35 we have 17/35 &lt; 35/72 &lt; 18/37, and we have the 37+35 system.<br/>The mapping to primes is</p><p>[  0   1]<br/>[ 30 -13]<br/>[ 13  -4]<br/>[ 14  -4]</p><p>It abounds in intervals of 7/5, which is the genrator, and is not too<br/>bad for 5/4, 7/4, 5/3 or 7/6; it is the fifth which is missing in<br/>action.</p><p>Finally, the mystery system which scores 651 turns out to be quite a<br/>find, a cross between Ennealimmal and Miracle--Enneamiracle, maybe?<br/>It has two generators, the limma 1/9 and a version of the secor. Its<br/>map to primes is</p><p>[  0    9]<br/>[ -2   16]<br/>[  1   20]<br/>[ -2   27]</p><p>It has commas of 225/224 and 40353607/40310784, the latter telling us<br/>that 2^11 ~ (7/3)^9 in this system.</p><p>I think this demonstrates the value of using ets such as 72 to give<br/>us wedgies.</p></div><h3><a id=31252 href="#31252">ðŸ”—</a>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2001 7:53:07 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>genewardsmith wrote:</p><p>&gt; I computed what we affectionately call the &quot;wedgie&quot; for each<br/>&gt; generator from 1 to 35 of the 72-et, used that to go to the<br/>&gt; corresponding linear temperament, and calculated the gens^2 cents<br/>&gt; badness measure of the temperament, to get the following list:</p><p>Sorry to lower the tone of the conversation, but I used to mix a lot in swimming and other<br/>athletic circles where a &quot;wedgie&quot; is when your swimming costume gets wedged or stuck up your rear<br/>end, causing the swimmer great discomfort or offering an incentive to get the race over quickly.</p><p>Not being facetious here, but hoping to avoid sniggers and other covert laughter should the name<br/>reach a wider audience.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div><h3><a id=31253 href="#31253">ðŸ”—</a>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2001 8:08:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Alison,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Not being facetious here, but hoping to avoid sniggers and other<br/>&gt; covert laughter should the name reach a wider audience.</p><p>&quot;Goodness&quot;, &quot;Badness&quot;, &quot;wedgie&quot; -- these people have a reason for<br/>their terms (apparantly).
