I had him for a couple of keyboard repertoire classes. He is<br/>a funny person, and a brilliant player. His manner is one that I found oddly<br/>lizard-like in person, but always pleasant and positive. His Bach playing<br/>starting getting sloppy as the years went on, mostly because he lusted after<br/>faster and faster tempi to the point of insanity. Incidentally, I premiered<br/>a composition of his for electric guitar and piano in 1992 (at the<br/>school)...a combination I&apos;ve written a few pieces for myself.</p><p>Secondly, I went to Northwestern for grad school. As piano major in the 1<br/>year degree program, I took an organ minor. I studied with Margaret Kemper,<br/>but Rubsam was there (this was when NU had an organ dept.!) and he heard my<br/>juries. I was flattered that he wanted me to become an organ major....either<br/>I was better than I thought at the time, or they were short on students, or<br/>a combination.<br/>Anyway, he&apos;s another eccentric, brilliant musician, and a real character in<br/>person, he looked like a shaved-headed Debussy with a crazy moustache and a<br/>bowtie. Weird about the barbershop....he also apparantly has a high tech<br/>barn with his Indiana home which houses a pipe organ and recording studio.</p><p>I enjoy Rubsam&apos;s organ playing on the Phillips label from the 70&apos;s, but,<br/>like Newman, his playing got weirder and weirder as he got older....his Bach<br/>started getting more and more rubato...at times it sounded, from what I<br/>remember, like whole beats would be shifted against one another, and extra<br/>half beats seemed inserted into measures.....a genius who is bored? Who<br/>knows, but not my cup of tea....I&apos;m more for the straight-ahead Walcha way<br/>myself, or somewhere reasonable in between...I like the way a guitarist like<br/>John Williams expressed Bach and I wish more pianists would take note of<br/>that way, and not blindly copy Gould or Schiff, brilliant thought they may<br/>be at their best:)</p><p>AKJ</p><p>On Sun, Oct 18, 2009 at 7:59 PM, hpiinstruments &lt;aaronhunt@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Wow, I knew about the outrageous mustache, but had no<br/>&gt; idea about his wind powered barbering activities!

I suppose one could find out what the<br/>tuning was on that instrument in 1986 by checking its tuning<br/>log (assuming the organ techs there kept it). I don&apos;t know<br/>who would be servicing that instrument. I have 4 CDs from<br/>this set. I heard somewhere there might be a fifth one, but<br/>I can&apos;t verify that. They are awe inspiring.</p><p>AKJ, that&apos;s cool you know both of these players! I do have<br/>some later recordings from Newman which I agree get too out<br/>of control with the speed, to the point of absurdity. But there<br/>is some crazy fast playing on the NC discs which is just brilliant.<br/>Rubsam on the other hand tends to play almost everything at a<br/>snail&apos;s pace, and he does do things with that agogic accent which<br/>sometimes are weird, as you say extremely rubato. Each to his<br/>own; I can understand not liking it so much. To me it reveals<br/>a lot of amazing lyricism in Bach&apos;s music that can get lost in<br/>more mechanical straight ahead interpretations. Like you say,<br/>a balance between the two is probably best, and I heard Rubsam<br/>striking a balance on these new piano Bach recordings.</p><p>Anybody interested in a free listen, stations can be created<br/>using these players&apos; names as seeds at Pandora:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.pandora.com">www.pandora.com</a>&gt; for easy copy and paste:<br/>Anthony Newman<br/>Wolfgang Rubsam</p><p>Cheers,<br/>AAH<br/>=====</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll put the Rubsam on my list of things to check out, thanks.<br/>&gt; I&apos;m a Newmanaut also -- have all the Bach organ he did in<br/>&gt; the &apos;70s for Vox, as well as an album of harpsichord toccatas<br/>&gt; and the Goldbergs, though the latter I felt were a little too<br/>&gt; showoffy and mechanical, even for him. :)  Waitaminute, which<br/>&gt; are the Newport organ recordings?

I bought a VoxBox<br/>of Newman some years ago and was disappointed with it. The<br/>organ sounded bad, the recording was out of tune (meaning<br/>reeds were off and mixtures were beating wildly, etc.), the<br/>editing was sloppy and audible, all around a bad CD. I even<br/>recall some tracks that sounded as if splices were made from<br/>recordings done on different instruments! It really was awful.<br/>So, I&apos;m glad to hear that there are other worthwhile VoxBox<br/>recordings of Newman playing Bach. I figured the CDs you<br/>were fond of could not possibly be the one I had bought (and<br/>discarded) so I was just commenting that based on this<br/>experience of mine, the VoxBox CDs are varying in quality,<br/>but likely that CD I bought (from a cutout bin) was pulled.<br/>If I were Newman I would definitely have petitioned to<br/>have it removed from the shelves. Can&apos;t imagine anyone<br/>approving of it.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>AAH</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hpiinstruments&quot; &lt;aaronhunt@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Carl, those VoxBox are all different recordings, kind of a<br/>&gt; &gt; mishmash of widely varying quality.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not in this case... at least, according to the liner notes, they<br/>&gt; were all recorded on the same organ around the same time, and<br/>&gt; the two volumes sound consistent throughout.
