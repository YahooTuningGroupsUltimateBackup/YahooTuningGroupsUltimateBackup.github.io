Do we know they<br/>&gt; had a general algorithm for this? Obviously, if they could take both<br/>&gt; square and cube roots they could construct 12-et, assuming they had a<br/>&gt; musical system in place that would make this a sensible development.</p><p>First thing to note: there are thousands upon thousands<br/>of clay tablets with Sumerian and Babylonain writing on<br/>them, still buried in the ground in Iraq.  Second thing:<br/>of the thousands of tablets that *have* been excavated<br/>and now are housed in museums around the world, only a<br/>tiny fraction of them have been deciphered and published.</p><p>There are many Babylonian tablets with lists of both<br/>square and cube roots.  There are far fewer Sumerian<br/>tablets which actually contain sophisticated math.<br/>But taking the caveats above into consideration, it is<br/>still very possible that some day these sophisticated<br/>Sumerian math tablets, if they do indeed exist, will<br/>eventually come to light.</p><p>But as I demonstrate on my webpage<br/>&quot;Speculations on Sumerian Tuning&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/sumerian/sumeriantuning.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/sumerian/sumeriantuning.htm</a></p><p>1) the Babylonians retained the Sumerian logograms,<br/>   along with additional Akkadian (= Babylonian) words,<br/>   to represent important components of math calculations;</p><p>2) the Sumerian logograms alone give the essence of the<br/>   problems, with the added Babylonian words merely supplying<br/>   detail or grammatical necessities.</p><p>Therefore, I assume in all of my Sumerian speculations<br/>that the Sumerians had already figured out the algorithms<br/>and results, centuries before they were conquered by<br/>the Babylonians and their own culture was subsumed into<br/>the Babylonian.</p><p>I have not actually *seen* any tablets that show the<br/>algorithm for finding square or cube roots, which is<br/>precisely why I went into such detail here... to show<br/>that, and how, it *could* be done.  The only evidence in<br/>the tablets is lists of the resulting roots, without<br/>specifying the algorithm.</p><p>This is the case with much of Sumerian/Babylonian math.<br/>There exist thousands of tablets giving lists of coefficients,<br/>with no real indication where those numbers came from.</p><p>On the other hand, there are also thousands of tablets<br/>containing math problems which require the use of those<br/>coefficients, thus showing us several of the algorithms<br/>that they did use and teach.</p><p>The famous Babylonian &quot;tuning tablet&quot;, CBS 10996, shows<br/>a method of tuning where the intervals are first tuned by<br/>4ths/5ths and then checked by 3rds/6ths.  This seems to<br/>me to indicate that some type of tempering was indicated.</p><p>Mostly, what I&apos;m really doing with this work is to<br/>simply publish the relevant sexagesimal numbers, in<br/>hopes that they will (or won&apos;t) turn up on tablets that<br/>are examined in the future, thus confirming (or denying)<br/>that the Sumerians were actually interested in 12-tET.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
