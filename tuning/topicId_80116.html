I&apos;m at Univ. of Miami now studying jazz<br/>and the &quot;rule&quot; around here is that b9&apos;s are only &quot;allowed&quot; over the<br/>root in jazz harmony. So C E G Bb Db is ok, and C E G Bb D F is not,<br/>since that E-F b9 exists over a note that isn&apos;t the root.

Consonant, but complex, rather than<br/>&quot;that guy messed his voicings up.&quot; So the rule I&apos;m at now is that it<br/>seems that if you have a &quot;diatonic&quot; b9 in there, it doesn&apos;t sound too<br/>hot. If you have a &quot;chromatic&quot; b9, it does. And it&apos;s hard to find the<br/>distinction in 12-equal, but it seems to have to do with implied<br/>harmonic relationships among the notes.</p><p>The thing I don&apos;t understand: phrygian mode uses the diatonic b9 all<br/>of the time, but it certainly works to create a mood, sounds<br/>functional, &apos;consonant&apos;, etc. Nonetheless, if you play a chord like C<br/>E G Bb D F, that b9 in there is going to be pretty hard to swallow.<br/>Why?</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2009 10:36:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>To make another point about it being context sensitive, this chord,<br/>voiced from top to bottom:</p><p>C G E F# B D#</p><p>That D# on top is extremely dissonant (or, as I like to think of it,<br/>&quot;consonant with complexity&quot;) - but while C-D# is an equal-tempered<br/>minor 3rd, I tend to hear that note on top as being far more<br/>dissonant.

My sincere apologies to many distinguished members of<br/>this forum which - unlike myself - are deeply knowledgeable in musical<br/>acoustics and do not need to be reminded these elementary matters.]</p><p>A. Most answers have interpreted the question literally: &quot;Given Equal<br/>Temperament, which interval is more dissonant?&quot;.<br/>I prefer to understand it as &quot;Given consonant intervals, which one is heard<br/>most out of tune in E.T.?&quot;.<br/>The second interpretation thus goes beyond absolute perception and relates<br/>rather to how well does E.T. approximate consonant intervals.<br/>B. Quite obviously, if an interval is heard as dissonant even if pure, its<br/>E.T. approximation will be just a bit more dissonant, so the mistuning is<br/>not really relevant: this point is found in ancient treatises.<br/>C. Thus the mistuning of E.T. is only relevant to consonant intervals. For<br/>simplicity let us limit ourselves to intervals not greater than the octave.<br/>D. There has been agreement since Renaissance times -this forum included-<br/>that mathematics and experience coincide in considering consonant those<br/>musical intervals ratios involving integers not larger than 5.<br/>E. The borderline case is the Minor Third 6:5, which however it is not<br/>perceived as really consonant due to the beats caused by its proximity with<br/>the Small Minor Third 7:6. This is why, from Baroque times on, most<br/>theoreticians lost interest forever in how well or badly a temperament tunes<br/>minor thirds.<br/>F. Thus we need to concentrate in intervals involving numbers not greater<br/>than 5. Let us see each one except the trivial unison 1:1.<br/>G. 2:1 is the octave, tuned pure in E.T. (except for strecthing etc.), no<br/>issue here.<br/>H. 3:2 is the fifth, mistuned by 2 Cents in E.T. By comparison with most<br/>historical temperaments this is a small amount and E.T. is historically the<br/>temperament with the best fifths.<br/>I. 4:3 is the fourth, complementary with the fifth within the pure octave,<br/>thus as good as the fifths in E.T.<br/>J. 5:4 is the major third. After Pythagorean (which uses major thirds as<br/>dissonances), E.T. is the worst historical temperament for the &quot;average&quot; or<br/>&quot;most usually played&quot; major thirds, with 13.7 Cents of mistuning for each<br/>one. Terrible!<br/>K. 5:3 is the major sixth. Slightly less consonant than the major third, but<br/>deviated by 15.7 Cents in E.T., thus also badly affected.<br/>There are no further consonant intervals within the octave. q.e.d.</p><p>Please be kind with the rebuttals ... :-)</p><p>Kind regards,<br/>Claudio</p><p>  _____</p><p>From: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> [<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of<br/>Carl Lumma<br/>Sent: 21 January 2009 19:12<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: What is the Most &quot;Out-Of-Tune&quot; or &quot;Dissonant&quot; Interval<br/>in Equal Temperament??</p><p>--- In tuning@yahoogroups. &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; com,<br/>&quot;micro_piano&quot; &lt;frankw802@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi all!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This question may SEEM very basic, but I&apos;d like to see what<br/>&gt; everyone ACTUALLY believes is the most &quot;out-of tune&quot; sounding<br/>&gt; (or &quot;dissonant&quot;) interval in Equal Temperament.</p><p>Easy!

In my opinion, dissonance of equal-tempered<br/>intervals should be compared with dissonance of the corresponding<br/>just intonation intervals. Dissonance of intervals, however, depends<br/>on the harmonic content of the considered sounds/instruments. So<br/>some intervals could be more or less dissonant depending on which<br/>instrument one is playing.</p><p>Briefly, as most of you know (and please correct me if I say<br/>something wrong) Sethares&apos; formula for dissonance (as I learn it<br/>from his paper on J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 94, 1218 (1993)) is based on a<br/>dissonance function for a pure tone dyad from Plomp&amp;Levelt&apos;s<br/>experiments and exploiting the concept of critical band. Given a<br/>harmonic spectrum, the two &quot;real&quot; sounds of the dyad<br/>are &quot;convoluted&quot; (in the way described in the cited paper) and a<br/>dissonance value is obtained for each interval, to obtain a<br/>dissonance plot. Typically, such plot has local minima at just<br/>intervals: the lower the value, the lower the dissonance.</p><p>Given a harmonic spectrum, let the dissonance of the ET interval be<br/>D_et and the one of the just interval D_ji. In my opinion, the<br/>higher/lower dissonance of the ET case (relative to the JI case) is<br/>expressed by the value D_r = D_et/Dji. D_r will be typically &gt; 1.</p><p>In this way, dissonance does not depend only on the the amount<br/>of &quot;detuning&quot; of tempered intervals from just ones, but also on how<br/>much the just interval was consonant/dissonant. To give an example:<br/>if I play a 2nd interval, it will be rather dissonant in both ji and<br/>et. This is because the difference between the dissonance curve<br/>values at the just and tempered value is not much, and also, it does<br/>not depend too much on the detuning. Instead, in the case of the 5th<br/>interval, if you detune it a little you get a strong variation of<br/>the dissonance function, because you are detuning close to a high-<br/>slope (derivative) part of the dissonance curve. I have not made any<br/>calculation yet but I bet that 2 cent detuning of the 5th gives more<br/>dissonance change than a 10 cent detuning of a 2nd....</p><p>All this of course depends on the spectrum you are using to plot<br/>your dissonance curve. I take this occasion to make a remark: I have<br/>tried to plot dissonance curves &quot;a la Sethares&quot; by using recorded<br/>spectra of some instruments I have sampled myself (giutar, piano,<br/>violin). It seems to me that the assumption made to plot dissonance<br/>curves in Sethares paper is a lot optimistic (he assumes a<br/>progressive amplitude fall rate of 0.88 for each harmonic). In this<br/>way, many local minima of the dissonance curves can be seen, at<br/>about all degrees of the diatonic just intonation scale. Instead, by<br/>using my spectra, I practically don&apos;t see any dip in the dissonance<br/>curve except 5th and to a lesser extent 4th (and of course unison<br/>and octave!) being the rest of the curve practically flat. So my<br/>final conclusion is that the most dissonant &quot;detuning&quot; from ji to et<br/>intervals is the one of the fifth!</p><p>Comments are very welcome!</p><p>Max</p></div><h3>caleb morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2009 6:59:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I&apos;ve come to the opinion that 12-tet is only capable of suggesting 5-limit chains.</p><p>So, you can almost guide the ear to hear 7-ratios, but not quite.</p><p>11-ratios and 13-ratios are just non-existent in 12-tet.</p><p>they are more subtle, and require some accuracy (+-5 cents, maybe?) to be heard as themselves.</p><p>C-G-E-F#-B-D#</p><p>a cool chord, B triad over C.</p><p>D# is definitely #2 (or #9) and the scale is C Lydian #3, or E harmonic minor.</p><p>caleb</p><p>On Jan 21, 2009, at 1:36 PM, Mike Battaglia wrote:</p><p>&gt; To make another point about it being context sensitive, this chord,<br/>&gt; voiced from top to bottom:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C G E F# B D#<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That D# on top is extremely dissonant (or, as I like to think of it,<br/>&gt; &quot;consonant with complexity&quot;) - but while C-D# is an equal-tempered<br/>&gt; minor 3rd, I tend to hear that note on top as being far more<br/>&gt; dissonant.

The A altered scale is the same thing as D#/Eb<br/>Lydian dominant, so the chord posted above is sort of like an<br/>alteration in which you play D# mixolydian over A7 instead of D#<br/>lydian dominant over A7.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/22/2009 9:02:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Jan 22, 2009 at 9:59 AM, caleb morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve come to the opinion that 12-tet is only capable of suggesting 5-limit<br/>&gt; chains.<br/>&gt; So, you can almost guide the ear to hear 7-ratios, but not quite.<br/>&gt; 11-ratios and 13-ratios are just non-existent in 12-tet.<br/>&gt; they are more subtle, and require some accuracy (+-5 cents, maybe?) to be<br/>&gt; heard as themselves.</p><p>Well, 17/16 and 19/16 is pretty much right there in 12-tet.
