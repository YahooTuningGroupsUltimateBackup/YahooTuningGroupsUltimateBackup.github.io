The editor asked me for simplify the<br/>level because people here don&apos;t understand anything, and<br/>I think this situation is more or less the same around the world.<br/>I believe the points of view I handle are useful for all One-listers.<br/>--------------------------<br/>A question : Who, when, was published (of course by writing)<br/>the word Microtone, or Microtonal,<br/>or related by first time? ,( Carrillo&apos;s book, article, program,<br/>letter ?, Another ?)<br/>Other : And/or, around which date did Carrillo use (speaking)<br/>by first time the same ?<br/>Another more : Who was the first person that wrote that Carrillo<br/>was the first ?, or simply the first time somebody<br/>writes the word without any reference to Carrillo?</p><p>Eduardo</p><p> <a href="http://dinarra.lookscool.com">http://dinarra.lookscool.com</a></p></div>
