However I frankly don&apos;t<br/>believe things would work that way.  The Yahoo website would be no<br/>different from any other previously &quot;unlicensed&quot; entity.  For<br/>example, there are certain performing organizations that can play my<br/>music without paying a licence fee to ASCAP.</p><p>One of the conditions is that performers are paid and that there is a<br/>paying audience.  So far, these conditions do not pertain on the Web,<br/>and ASCAP, and I presume GEMA works similarly, have not licensed all<br/>the sites, nor are they necessarily intending to license them...</p><p>Let&apos;s say, for example, that ASCAP suddenly wanted to<br/>license the Yahoo site for original music and let&apos;s say I had<br/>original music on the Yahoo site.  (I don&apos;t so the point is a bit<br/>mute, but let&apos;s continue the exercise).</p><p>ASCAP would request a license fee for my music.  Yahoo would either<br/>pay it, at that point, under a blanket license, or they would point<br/>to their &quot;terms of service&quot; and say that under this agreement any of<br/>my posted material is not subject to a license, presuming that I read<br/>the agreement before I posted anything on the site.</p><p>Let&apos;s say ASCAP (or GEMA) would demand again, and *I* wouldn&apos;t end up<br/>paying anything, but Yahoo could ask me, because of the licensing<br/>pressure, to remove my licensed materials from the site, rather than<br/>paying anything themselves through a blanket license, which is how<br/>they would do it in such a case.</p><p>It would be the same kind of situation with a performing group, let&apos;s<br/>say, which figures out that if it wants to play my music they have to<br/>pay an ASCAP fee.  They may decide, therefore, that they cannot<br/>afford to play my music or the music of any ASCAP-affiliated<br/>composer.</p><p>Then, they wouldn&apos;t ask *me* to contribute anything, but they would<br/>withdraw my music from the concert they were planning.</p><p>The same thing would happen here, and I would be asked to take my<br/>original materials off the website.</p><p>However, such a thing has not happened as of yet, and the fact that<br/>there is little original copyrighted musical material on this site,<br/>or probably anywhere on the text-based Yahoo Groups would auger that<br/>an ASCAP licensing foray would be very unlikely.</p><p>Sites which would be MUCH MORE likely for this kind of targeted<br/>licensing have already been swiftly approached.  For example <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a><br/>already pays blanket license fees to ASCAP and as I&apos;m sure you&apos;re<br/>aware, has paid severe penalties for copyright &quot;infringement&quot;....</p><p>I doubt very seriously that ASCAP, BMI or GEMA are going to take any<br/>licensing interest in anything on the primarily text-based Yahoo<br/>groups and if they do, the COMPOSER wouldn&apos;t pay anything, but he/she<br/>might be asked to withdraw copyrighted materials from the site...</p><p>______ ____ _____ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=18375 href="#18375">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Alves &#x3C;ALVES@ORION.AC.HMC.EDU&#x3E;</h3><span>2/5/2001 9:00:54 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>As I offered when the Mills site shut down, I am happy to host the tuning<br/>list here. This is a college, we don&apos;t attach advertising, we have blanket<br/>licenses, we won&apos;t harvest email addresses, etc. HOWEVER, my understanding<br/>of the list software that we run is that:</p><p>1. There is no web interface,<br/>2. There is no automated archive,<br/>3. There is no digest mode (I think),<br/>4. There is no public disk space for uploading of files.</p><p>By the way, from Dan&apos;s description, I believe the United States&apos; performing<br/>rights agencies, ASCAP and BMI, are different from GEMA in that contracts<br/>with the composers are non-exclusive. That is, they serve only to collect<br/>performance rights royalties as an agent of the composer. The composer<br/>remains free to collect those royalties or assign performance rights in<br/>other ways as well. Therefore there is no problem with composers putting<br/>their own works on the web -- they have essentially assigned their<br/>performance rights to themselves and ASCAP/BMI are by-passed. They can also<br/>enter into an agreement with someone, including, I suppose, Yahoo, that<br/>allows them to use their works without the consent of ASCAP or BMI. At<br/>least that is my understanding.</p><p>Regardless of the way that the vote goes, I admit that I am pretty peeved<br/>at Yahoo as well. I still can&apos;t get through the web interface because of<br/>problems connecting my &quot;yahoo&quot; identity with my egroups one. My email to<br/>yahoo&apos;s help line only resulted in an automated reply with all the<br/>information I already had.
