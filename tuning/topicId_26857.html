Thanks for your<br/>&gt; comment.  Sincerely,</p><p>The French Temperament Ordinaire differs from other well-temperaments<br/>in that it has a few perfect fifths _wider_ than pure -- typically<br/>the fifth Bb-F and adjacent fifths. Thus the remaining fifths have to<br/>be narrowed by a total of more than one pythagorean comma. Generally<br/>this means that all keys from F major through A major will be very<br/>pure and meantone-like. Manuel may have some specific examples.</p></div>
