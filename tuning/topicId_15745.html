Just matter of deciding how to do the utonal tetrads.</p><p>&gt;These are great Robert. Thanks. But many of the sounds don&apos;t seem right.<br/>&gt;They often play fewer notes than I&apos;m expecting and some play none.</p><p>Sorry about that, I&apos;ll check tomorrow.</p><p>I&apos;ve also realised, the 1, 3, 5, 7, 11 dekany is in both the 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and<br/>1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 figure, so two versions are needed, one joining onto 9s, and one,<br/>onto 13s.</p><p>I&apos;ll see what I can do about it all tomorrow,...</p><p>BTW what is this figure called?</p><p>Will also need to do 4)6 version of this same figure at some point, which I expect will<br/>use the 3)5 dekany, and otonal tetrads + utonal pentads.</p><p>The Eikosany will also have six 2)5 Dekanies in it (also six 3)5 Dekanies).</p><p>In fact, the 2)5 ones will be the same as these, except each multiplied by an extra factor.</p><p>E.g. the 1, 3, 5, 7, 13 Dekany will be there joining all vertices of 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 Eikosany<br/>that have a factor 11 in them, with all its notes multiplied by 11.</p><p>However the Eikosany has only three Dekanies meeting at every vertex -</p><p>3*5*7 for instance belongs to the three Dekanies consisting of all multiples of 3, of 5, and of 7 respectively.</p><p>(while in this figure, each vertex belongs to four Dekanies -  to take an ex, 11*13 belongs to all except the two ones<br/>that leave out 11, and 13).</p><p>Eikosany is much more of a challenge, if one wants to include _all_ the consonant chords.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
