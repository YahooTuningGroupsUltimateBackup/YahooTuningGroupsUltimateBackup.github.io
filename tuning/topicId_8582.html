Jerry<br/>&gt;Eskelin is right...</p><p>I went through a stage like this, but later I came to see 12tet as just<br/>another interesting tuning, and that its not an &quot;either/or&quot; proposition<br/>(gotta watch out for that quasi-religious zealotry that sometimes rears its<br/>head among microtonalists). . Just as different languages allow for<br/>different expression, so do different tunings, and 12tet has amply proved<br/>its fecundity as a language. Neither do I think its possiblilities have been<br/>exhausted. Of course its tremedously exciting to journey into the largely<br/>unexplored jungle of microtonality, but hanging out in your familiar living<br/>room sometimes is fun too. I like doing both.</p><p>Sometimes after playing JI guitar, when I pick up my 12tet guitar it sounds<br/>&quot;out of tune&quot; for a minute. (Actually, it &gt;is&lt; out of tune from that<br/>perspective). Of course some of the sounds on the JI guitar are pretty &quot;out<br/>there&quot;  from any perspective that I can hear from. JI doesn&apos;t really sound<br/>&quot;out of tune&quot;, but can be much more wildly dissonant than anything in 12tet!<br/>Even if 12tet sounds a little &quot;monochrome&quot; compared to JI,  black and white<br/>photography and drawings can be just as great as color.</p><p>Dante</p></div><h3><a id=8585 href="#8585">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@capecod.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/15/2000 1:13:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Joseph Pehrson:]<br/>&gt; For what it&apos;s worth...
