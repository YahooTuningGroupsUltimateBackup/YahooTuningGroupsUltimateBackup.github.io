At this point in my life, I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; need that kind of worry. Which is one of the philosophical reasons I<br/>&gt; just laugh at all these many-hundreds-of-steps tunings!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ozanyarman@superonline.com">ozanyarman@superonline.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Comb it ya dirty brush<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For that very reason, I use two thick brushes of alternate &gt; fibrillations rather than a twitchy comb. It leaves a nice luster on &gt; the hair follicles... (lol)</p><p>Puns etc.:</p><p>I&apos;m pleased to see that a few people appreciate and have developed my surreal metaphors, and puns.<br/>It seems to go with the subject (a la Ivor Darreg, who could carry them on for hours during conversations in diners.)</p><p>JND:</p><p>The reason that I am splitting hairs about the precision of tuning is more than just noticeable differences (jnd) as Hyacinth ( friend of  Wizard Smith?) recently added:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Tuning">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Tuning</a></p><p>The approximations may be audibly acceptable for monophonic (single line) melodies; but ........</p><p>Not wanting to beat this to death;-)</p><p>but it is ALL ABOUT  BEATING!!!!!!!!!</p><p>and beats are certainly noticeable - ask hundreds of years of piano tuners.</p><p>Let&apos;s have fun with it..</p><p>The next obvious logical direction of my reasoning here is into our perception of frequencies between approx. 4 and 16 Hz; where instead if pitches we hear tempos as the pitch/tempo reduces.</p><p>I&apos;ll resist the urge to teach grandma how to evacuate eggs - and leave it to the experts....</p><p>Emulating Harrison (LucyTuning) from pi:</p><p>Were one to search all the various fancifully-named &quot;fractions of commas&quot; meantone - (horrendous name for a family of tunings), and equal temperaments,<br/>I am sure that even closer emulations to LucyTuning could be dredged up and presented as viable alternatives - (BTW the patents have expired so it&apos;s now public domain.)</p><p>Musical and composition problems with using 88 edo to emulate Harrison&apos;s ideas.</p><p> Large interval of LucyTuning is close to 14 (88edo) intervals (*5) = 70<br/> the small interval LT is close to 9 (88edo) intervals (*2) = 18<br/>Octave = 5L+2s = 88 (88edo) intervals.</p><p>If you wish to produce music, (as I do) it is helpful to be able to readily convert harmonies into Lucy or other microtuned renditions using MIDI and tables.</p><p>I find it much easier to use pre-prepared tuning codes, and think in Western harmonic terms directly as Large and small intervals, instead of Wholetones and semitones.<br/>So I load the free to download codes for .tun, .scl, PBND, Logic, Melodyne or whatever into my tunings folder, and I can use whatever microtunable software in a DAW immediately and easily,<br/>by simply selecting which table to use: 5b0s; 3b2s: 0b5s etc. for obvious Western harmonies or more &quot;exotic&quot; codes for others, I can immediately play and hear a wide variety of different harmonics interpretations.</p><p>see:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html">http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html</a></p><p>to download free codes, tables etc.</p><p>This is a more convenient way to be able to do everything that 88 edo can do, and enables me to map and immediately understand musically and harmonically what is happening -<br/>and control the consonance and dissonance in a rational way.</p><p>Other ways of using 88edo etc. seem to be developments from Schoenberg&apos;s work and serial music, which along with shouted tuneless rap is off my &quot;like to listen to&quot; menu.</p><p>One fine day I intend to go harmonically beyond 88 notes per octave, and when that day comes; I&apos;ll just produce even more tuning codes ..... the future is beyond all limits - even 88 and and n/m comma meantones.</p><p>Monz wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; philosopical difference, yes.<br/>&gt; mathematical difference, yes.<br/>&gt; audible difference, no.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; and thanks for the link to Harrison&apos;s description of<br/>&gt; the tuning.  that&apos;s exactly what i wanted from you.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Good.  so we are now agreed.</p><p>&gt; very strange ...
