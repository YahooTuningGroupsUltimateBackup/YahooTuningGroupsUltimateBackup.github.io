I&apos;ll go through the programme and comment, so as not to leave anything out.</p><p>DAY SESSION 1</p><p>Composing for Quarter-Tone Alto Flute</p><p>This was a mixed lecture and recital.  Carla Rees played a Kingma flute.   It&apos;s got a good, consistent tone, but all we were given was quartertones.  There were some electronics as well, which were too loud as tends to be the case at classical events.  Give &apos;em an amplifier, and they think they&apos;re rock stars.</p><p>The Rosegarden Codicil: Rehearsal Strategies in 19-ET</p><p>This team at Glasgow University have hacked the Rosegarden sequencer to help singers learn microtonal scales.  You sing into a microphone and it shows how close you&apos;re getting to the desired pitch.  The examples are, as the title suggests, for 19-equal but it can work with general tunings specified by files using an extension of the Scala format.  They also used some PD for electronic backing.  They gave out Knoppix CDs so that you can boot into an OS with the software pre-installed.  It doesn&apos;t work with my soundcard :(</p><p>Some Microtonal Experiments</p><p>Lecture by Patrick Ozzard-Low.  Included some reasons for not liking quartertones, which was good as there were a lot of quartertones around.</p><p>recital by William Raaijman</p><p>Unaccompanied quartertone saxophone.  Very intense performance, this one.</p><p>Fine Tuning and Tonal Hybrids</p><p>Lecture by Christopher Fox, in which he was outed as using 72-equal.  He came to it by mixing quartertones and sixth-tones in the same piece in order to approximate the harmonic series up to 13 or so.  He never gets mentioned on these lists, but he&apos;s on the radio now and then so he must have a following.  He mixes spectralist ideas with equal scales.  The &quot;tonal hybrids&quot; in the title refers to what we would call polymicrotonality.  Although we might more specifially call it 72-equal.</p><p>recital by duo Contour</p><p>The trumpets use string to pull the extra valve(s) now, instead of a solenoid.  There&apos;s one for quartertones, and another for 19-equal.  Most pieces used a standard drum kit, but for stuttering accompaniments instead of a back beat.  I couldn&apos;t really see the point of that.  I think this was the one where they had to stop a piece to adjust the drums.  More evidence that, while PCs may not be entirely reliable, this doesn&apos;t stop acoustic instruments.</p><p>Microtonal Procedures ... for Solo Recorder Player</p><p>How to play quartertones on your recorder, from what I remember.  There was a fingering chart, which I thought about picking up but I sat at the back and they must have had it at the front so I didn&apos;t walk past it.  I don&apos;t know if they work for descant, but if so that would make it a good, cheap microtonal instrument.  Still quartertones, though.</p><p>Pocket Gamelan: rational for interactive performance using mobile phones</p><p>Greg Schiemer on microtonality for Java-based phones.  There were problems with the projector in this one, which generally disrupted it and may be why I don&apos;t remember much about it.  The phones talk to each other with bluetooth and he&apos;s hoping to get lots of them working together but the software isn&apos;t there yet.</p><p>Pythagorean Harmonies in Trompettes de Mort</p><p>Margaret Lucy Wilkins, formerly of Huddersfield University, on one of her microtonal pieces.  The title says &quot;Pythagorean&quot; but what she was doing looked like it was using the whole harmonic series.  The notation uses quartertone accidentals, and it looked like they were relative to equal temperament, not pythagorean intonation.  Quite good musically, so if the theory sounds messy it&apos;s all in a good cause.</p><p>Megastaff: A Notation for all Possible Pitches</p><p>A very good presentation by Aaron Hunt.  If you&apos;re running a conference you should book him.  The subject was this crazily ambitious notation scheme with 41 nominal pitches to the octave and accidentals to bring it up to 205.  He also has a keyboard to play them all across several octaves, along with supporting software, and he&apos;s planning to sell it. So watch out.  He says he&apos;s been on tuning-math before.  His websites are <a href="http://www.enamcipation-of-pitch.com">www.enamcipation-of-pitch.com</a> and <a href="http://www.h-pi.com">www.h-pi.com</a> if you want to check it out.</p><p>recital by Rare Bird</p><p>Rachel Barnes and Natasha Powell doing quartertones with recorders, as explained in the lecture earlier on.  A lot of the sound was very harsh.   I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s because you have to blow hard to get the quartertones stable, or that it was written like that.  They&apos;re big recorders as well, so not even the excuse of being cheap, although no doubt still cheaper than the modified flutes and trumpets.</p><p>A Microtonal Manual for the Trumpet</p><p>Donald Bousted explaining his book with examples from Stephen Altoft. As Donald organized the festival, this is the bit that fits in with the self-aggrandizing theories.  Anyway, it was about playing quartertones on a standard trumpet and changing tubing and adding valves to get 19-equal and those good old quartertones.  I was quite impressed with Stephen&apos;s virtuosity here, when all he did was play scales.  It&apos;s a shame he doesn&apos;t have some better music to play.</p><p>recital by Elizabeth Smalt</p><p>The notes don&apos;t say who did the vocals here.  The highlights were superb performances of music by Harry Partch: some Li Po songs and By The Rivers of Babylon.  Bob Gilmore used an inauthentic DX7II in place of the chromelodeon for the latter piece.  About the only decent melody in the festival.  Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m more familiar with it, but I&apos;m not that familiar, and it gave the impression that he was streets ahead of everybody else here as a microtonal composer.  Tragic, really, as the comparison is mostly with music was written in the 30 years since he died.  They couldn&apos;t even manage to steal his ideas.  The adapted viola is the first fruit of a project to build replicas of Partch instruments in Europe.</p><p>Microtonality: my part in its downfall</p><p>Lecture by Bob Gilmore, a history of the microtonal movement.  For the record, I think Helmholtz, Ellis and Bosanquet would count as 19th Century microtonalists.</p><p>Wild Dog 1</p><p>An installation with music, video and tents.  A nice end to the festival so long as you didn&apos;t take it too seriously.  I don&apos;t know what all the music was, because it doesn&apos;t seem to be what the notes say it should have been.  It looked like that William Raaijman sneaked back in with his saxophone.  Also some documented pieces for microtonal trumpets played by Stephen Altoft.  They sounded like the pieces that weren&apos;t good enough for the other recitals -- and I don&apos;t want to make those appear wonderful by the comparison.  If anybody out there wants to write some decent music for trumpet in (or close to) 19- or 24-equal you might be in luck.  Unless he&apos;s allergic to tunes, and thinks listening to scales in alternative tunings is a really ecstatic experience.  The best music was dirty, electronic stuff by Philip Henderson.  Not microtonal I take it.</p><p>Anyway, that was that.  They&apos;re planning a UK MicroFest 2 in 2 years time.  The call is apparently out, and there might be funding for ambitious projects to give fruit by that date.</p><p>                             Graham</p></div><h3><a id=61589 href="#61589">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>10/18/2005 12:12:10 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@g...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Megastaff: A Notation for all Possible Pitches<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A very good presentation by Aaron Hunt.

If you&apos;re running a<br/>&gt;&gt;conference you should book him.  The subject was this crazily<br/>&gt;&gt;ambitious notation scheme with 41 nominal pitches to the<br/>&gt;&gt;octave and accidentals to bring it up to 205.  He also has a<br/>&gt;&gt;keyboard to play them all across several octaves, along with<br/>&gt;&gt;supporting software, and he&apos;s planning to sell it.<br/>&gt; &gt; What did it look like?</p><p>The keyboard?  The notation?  The software.</p><p>The notation must be on the website.  It looks like a normal staff but with lighter lines for all the extra notes.  Normal accidental symbols do the very small pitch changes.</p><p>The keyboard&apos;s a load of switches in a big grid.  Groups of 5 keys in a column are colored the same, so the effect is of a Bosanquet keyboard. If you like you can tune to 41-Pythagorean and lose some of the precision.  The final version will be in a proper case with key tops instead of the bare switches.  The one he brought was very electronics-chic.  You can plug it into any GM synth, so it presumably sends pitch bends.  I didn&apos;t get a chance to play it because I was detained a bit after his talk, and so by the time I got to the back he was already taking the keyboard apart.  The octave span is roughly (maybe exactly, he tends to research that sort of thing) the same as for a piano.</p><p>The software looked pretty good, with a GUI.  You can set up any scale you want, and tune individual notes by hand.  No mention of what platform(s) it supports.</p><p>&gt; To be fair, I think he was streets ahead of a lot of people<br/>&gt; as a composer.  Then again, calling oneself &quot;microtonal&quot; doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; mean much to me as a listener.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t matter what you call yourself as long as you write microtonal music.  The thing about the Partch is that he actually gave the impression that he felt at home in his tuning.  With the other composers (in a broad generalization) it was more of an exotic holiday.  Now, it may be the performers weren&apos;t so familiar with it as well.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Tragic, really, as the comparison is mostly with music was<br/>&gt;&gt;written in the 30 years since he died.  They couldn&apos;t even<br/>&gt;&gt;manage to steal his ideas.<br/>&gt; &gt; I suppose we wouldn&apos;t like it if they did.  The modus operandi<br/>&gt; of Western music seems to be to create your own style.</p><p>Of contemporary classical music, maybe, although a lot of it still ends up sounding the same.  It&apos;s normal for rock bands to start out copying what they like, and even carry on that way.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Anyway, that was that.  They&apos;re planning a UK MicroFest 2 in<br/>&gt;&gt;2 years time.  The call is apparently out, and there might be<br/>&gt;&gt;funding for ambitious projects to give fruit by that date.<br/>&gt; &gt; Still sounds like progress to me!</p><p>Oh, I think so.  I&apos;m trying to keep out of the politics.

Included a discussion of the term &quot;microtonal&quot;, how strange it is to call yourself a &quot;microtonalist&quot; (that means you!) and how you never hear of &quot;microtonalism&quot;.  I mentioned those three names because he said there was no microtonality in the 19th Century, but I didn&apos;t say anything at the time because none of them are significant composers (are they?) and it would have seemed like nit picking.

I think that&apos;s quite reasonable for a UK MicroFest.  The American scene seems to have a lot more variety, and no doubt their MicroFests reflect this.  These lists are very diverse, and generally electronic or American.  Who&apos;s going to cross the Atlantic for a performance with only 10 paying audience members?

The renown Turkish Qanun virtuoso Ruhi Ayangil - although cursing and swearing for the toil caused by the extra latches - celebrated my efforts wholeheartedly a few days ago when he came to visit. That was the price to pay for greater accuracy of pitch. But he was eventually highly pleased with the instrument! 79 MOS 159-tET was the practical limit that scored a grand success. To my knowledge, no other traditional fixed-tuning instrument in the world exists yielding such an unmatched detail of musical expression. The sounds that resonate from my Qanun are simply delightful, and you can probably play any genre, any music in the world with it.</p><p>So, the issue simply is: 159 tones are impossible to implement on any instrument whose accuracy and stability of pitch wavers around 3-4 cents. Since most instruments are hampered thus, we need just the right amount of tones ordered in just the right manner for consistent transpositions. Now I wonder if some similar MOS can be created with fewer tones from some other monster edo.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Gene Ward Smith<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 21 Ekim 2005 Cuma 22:21<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: UK MicroFest report</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ozan Yarman&quot; &lt;ozanyarman@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; The difference between 5/4 and the 205 major third is practically<br/>  null.
