Intervallically, the three 5-limit consonances should all be considered, and each should be evaluated in terms of its field of attraction (Harry Partch&apos;s Observation One: the field of attraction is inversely proportional to the limit of the interval). The worst error in some previously recommended tunings:</p><p>Tuning                   Worst Error (cents*limit)<br/>50-Equal                   18.2<br/>2/7-comma meantone         18.4<br/>Kornerup&apos;s Golden          21.4<br/>LucyTuning                 21.7<br/>1/4-comma meantone         26.9<br/>31-equal                   29.8<br/>1/3- &amp; 2/9-comma meantone  35.8<br/>19-equal                   36.8<br/>1/5-comma meantone         43.0<br/>43-equal                   43.3<br/>55-equal                   50.9<br/>1/6-comma meantone         53.8<br/>12-equal                   78.2<br/>26-equal                   85.4<br/>Pythagorean               107.5</p><p>The minimax principle tells us to find the tuning with the smallest worst error.

It will be where the minor third, relative to its field of attraction, is tied with the fifth, relative to its field of attraction (the major third will be better), because then improving one of them will worsen the other. So 1/5 the error of the perfect fifth equals 1/3 the error of the minor third. Since the minor third is generated by 3 fifths, its error is a comma minus three times the error in the fifth, so we have 1/5 the error in the fifth equals 1/3 of (a comma minus 3 times the error in the fifth), or</p><p>x/5=1/3*(comma-3x)<br/>x/5=1/3*comma-x<br/>x*6/5=1/3*comma<br/>x=5/18*comma</p></div><h3><a id=2211 href="#2211">ðŸ”—</a>manuel.op.de.coul@xxx.xx</h3><span>4/7/1999 5:54:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; (Harry Partch&apos;s Observation One: the field of attraction is inversely<br/>proportional<br/>&gt; to the limit of the interval).</p><p>Unfortunately the tolerance for mistuning works the other way.

That&apos;s interesting and helpful. I think the answer for &quot;tolerance of mistuning&quot;<br/>is not some function that increases and then decreases for higher limit ratios. I think<br/>the answer is a very sensitive function of musical context. Manuel&apos;s perceptions may be<br/>right in some contexts, field of attraction may be more relevant in other contexts, but<br/>typically different intervals will play different roles and not be strictly comparable<br/>as if the only difference between them were a numerical one.</p><p>So, I think I can safely say that for two-voice Renaissance and Baroque music, where<br/>thirds and sixths greatly outnumber fifths (and fourths are considered dissonant),<br/>something close to 2/7-comma meantone would be optimal.

Then the<br/>major &gt;thirds are 2.39 cents sharp and the minor thirds are 3.58 cents flat relative to &gt;Just Intonation.<br/>&gt;The worst errors (that of the fifth and minor third) both have cents*limit = 17.9 &gt;in 5/18-comma meantone. 50-equal is certainly close enough.</p><p>Tonight I finally got a hold of copies of Mandelbaum&apos;s dissertation and Jorgenson&apos;s tome. The first few pages of both contain information on the proposed tuning system of Robert Smith. According to Mandelbaum, Smith&apos;s ideal fifth in his<br/>1759 _Harmonics_ is flat by, you guessed it, 5/18 of a comma. Mandelbaum&apos;s description makes it seem as if Smith might have used the same derivation as me. According to Jorgenson, however, Smith&apos;s ideal fifth derived from equal-beating<br/>considerations and satisfies the equation 3x^3+4x=16. That implies a fifth 0.0027 cents smaller than that of 5/18-comma meantone. Though this is really splitting paramecial hairs, anyone know who&apos;s right about Smith?</p></div>
