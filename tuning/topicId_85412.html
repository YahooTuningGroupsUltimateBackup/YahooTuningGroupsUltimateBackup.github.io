As you say,<br/>&gt; there are no outrageous claims in the interview. The statement that<br/>&gt; I disagree with is the one concerning the ability of movie audiences<br/>&gt; to digest unusual music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You want advocacy from a working pro??<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, I guess not - I don&apos;t think the Penderecki stuff in &apos;The<br/>&gt; Shining&apos; served a didactic purpose. I just find it hard to believe<br/>&gt; that the mainstream audiences would be unable to accept an<br/>&gt; experimental score in a sci-fi movie like this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you think of a lot of mainstream movies that weren&apos;t expressing<br/>&gt; &gt; terror or the utterly strange?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean ones with far-out music? But doesn&apos;t this movie deal with<br/>&gt; terror and the utterly strange? There&apos;s a long tradition of using<br/>&gt; non-mainstream music to express those emotions: atonality,<br/>&gt; electronic music, noise... And audiences haven&apos;t been turned off by &gt; that even if they wouldn&apos;t listen to that kind of music without the<br/>&gt; images. (Though I believe the soundtrack LP to 2001 with the Ligeti<br/>&gt; pieces sold a lot.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Danny Elfman&apos;s score for A Simple Plan was also &apos;unspeakably<br/>&gt; &gt; eerie&apos; (though I liked it) according to Billie Bob Thornton.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://elfman.filmmusic.com/filmography/a_simple_plan.html">http://elfman.filmmusic.com/filmography/a_simple_plan.html</a><br/>&gt; Thanks for pointing this movie out - gotta see it! Strange music<br/>&gt; indeed - but was it in any way a problem for the reception / success<br/>&gt; of the movie?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is how people unaccustomed to novel tunings hear microtonal<br/>&gt; &gt; music--on a spectrum from exotic to strange to scary.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which is why i find it odd to assume that it (or other &quot;avantgarde<br/>&gt; experiences&quot;) would be too weird for Avatar&apos;s audiences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Juhani<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Them&apos;s the breaks.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You don&apos;t really point to what you think is utterly depressing and<br/>&gt; &gt; stupid here, but even allowing for internet exaggeration, I<br/>&gt; disagree.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Caleb<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On Dec 20, 2009, at 4:58 PM, Juhani wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What an utterly depressing and stupid statement.

There are so many examples... Psycho, 2001, The Shining,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; just to mention a few obvious ones. Hey, there&apos;s microtonality<br/>&gt; even<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the rock&apos;n&apos;roll biopic &apos;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&apos; - but in a &gt; sci-<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fi extravaganza the composer &quot;couldn&apos;t put something in front of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; them that&apos;s light years ahead and expect them to accept it&quot;.

He says<br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in an interview about scoring the film:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The biggest challenge, he says, was working out how far he<br/>&gt; could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; push audiences. &quot;Visually, audiences are able to accept almost<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; anything, but in terms of film music, I couldn&apos;t put something in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; front of them that&apos;s light years ahead and expect them to accept<br/>&gt; it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I had long discussions with Jim and we decided that mainstream<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; audiences were not ready for an avant garde experience &mdash; they<br/>&gt; don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; listen to avant garde music and Avatar is not an art film. The<br/>&gt; score<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; needed to be grounded; that&apos;s where the world&apos;s ear is.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;What I have done is create a world that uses a tremendous<br/>&gt; amount<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of colour &mdash; colours that we haven&apos;t heard before. There is a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tremendous amount of different vocalisations in the score, as well<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as conventional orchestral music. For example, you&apos;ll hear a small<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; bit of orchestral music, then three or four ethnic instruments &gt; will<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; play and then somebody will sing and then the orchestra will do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; something and it has to all be seamless over, say, a 12-minute<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sequence. It&apos;s been very difficult to keep straight. It&apos;s not like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; saying, &grave;OK, we have a 12-minute sequence and the orchestra will<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; play until the end.&apos; We start a piece of music that lasts 12<br/>&gt; minutes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but in the course of that piece of music maybe ten different<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ensembles will play.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That sounds to me that if there is any microtonal/world stuff,<br/>&gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is going to be in &apos;source&apos; music, little scenes of natives playing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; indigenous instruments, or something along those lines. The bulk<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the score, I&apos;m sure, will be standard orchestral/Hollywood<br/>&gt; material.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Complete interview here:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6936869.ece">http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6936869.ece</a><br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jon<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>oljare &#x3C;oljare@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/29/2009 12:43:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>So, now i&apos;ve seen the film, and i can confirm there was nothing remotely microtonal at any point, even where i suspected there might be. Still pretty awesome though, worth seeing for the fact alone that it&apos;s going to revolutionize cinema as a whole, to make not only 3D models of alien creatures, but 3D models of real human actors look and act that realistic!</p><p>/&Ouml;</p></div>
