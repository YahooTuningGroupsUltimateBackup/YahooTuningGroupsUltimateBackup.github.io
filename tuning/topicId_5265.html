Well after about a minute or so of standing cross-armed<br/>before the tape deck, said skillful and enthusiastic bass player said:<br/>&quot;What is this stuff?&quot; And as I (proudly and enthusiastically) started<br/>to go about telling him, he calmly said, &quot;That&apos;s the worst shit I&apos;ve<br/>ever heard,&quot; and slammed the door on his way out... (Fortunately<br/>enough for me, my music wasn&apos;t the worst shit I&apos;d ever heard, and I<br/>learned an almost valuable lesson - If I ever planned to sell<br/>anything, then I&apos;d best leave my music home.)</p><p>&gt;Sometimes I am argumentative or harsh but I believe that the truth<br/>will ultimately be more beneficial than misconceptions. Not that I<br/>always know the truth, or am always right,</p><p>(As I&apos;ve said before,) I personally believe that the TD benefits<br/>greatly from someone like Paul, i.e., someone whom has both the<br/>technical skill knowledge &amp; know-how, and a nearly daily desire to<br/>wade through all this stuff for any slack in the facts (so to speak).<br/>And as long as this doesn&apos;t create an atmosphere where genuinely<br/>interested people are perhaps wary of posting for fear of being made<br/>to appear as though they don&apos;t know what their talking about, I<br/>certainly see this (&quot;- Paul the tuning nerd&quot;) as a real big plus.</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=5266 href="#5266">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/1999 4:25:29 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;D.Stearns&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; (As I&apos;ve said before,) I personally believe that the TD benefits<br/>&gt; greatly from someone like Paul, i.e., someone whom has both the<br/>&gt; technical skill knowledge &amp; know-how, and a nearly daily desire to<br/>&gt; wade through all this stuff for any slack in the facts (so to speak).<br/>&gt; And as long as this doesn&apos;t create an atmosphere where genuinely<br/>&gt; interested people are perhaps wary of posting for fear of being made<br/>&gt; to appear as though they don&apos;t know what their talking about,</p><p>But it has.</p><p>&gt; I<br/>&gt; certainly see this (&quot;- Paul the tuning nerd&quot;) as a real big plus.</p><p>Certainly a therorist at the least.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n  N e t  R a d i o<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div><h3><a id=5271 href="#5271">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/1999 12:03:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:<br/>&gt;And as long as this doesn&apos;t create an atmosphere where genuinely<br/>interested people are perhaps wary of posting for fear of being made<br/>to appear as though they don&apos;t know what their talking about,</p><p>To which David Beardsley responded:<br/>&gt; But it has.</p><p>Well it seems like a pretty fine line to walk... I think it was Kraig<br/>Grady who said (something along the lines of) we should create an<br/>atmosphere where people aren&apos;t afraid to admit what they don&apos;t know,<br/>or don&apos;t understand, and I certainly agree with this. But the TD *is*<br/>a give &amp; take situation, where if you disagree, or think someone or<br/>something is wrong about someone or something, you have the perfect<br/>opportunity (forum) to explain why... again, while I appreciate being<br/>informed about any slack in the facts (by someone in who&apos;s abilities<br/>to do so, I have some confidence), others might not (perhaps finding<br/>it a bit irritating, or somewhat oppressive...). But I for one would<br/>much much rather have it than not -- and I&apos;ve had my share of (mildly)<br/>testy back &amp; forths with Paul on and off list.</p><p>&gt; Certainly a therorist at the least.</p><p>For which it would seem that the format (or restrictions) of the TD is<br/>perhaps best suited... But this doesn&apos;t mean that purely musical &amp;<br/>aesthetic points of view, processes and experiences can&apos;t be expressed<br/>and explained... or that audio files, instruments, web sites, gigs,<br/>CDs, etc., can&apos;t be promoted, pointed out and posted about... And in<br/>all honesty, I&apos;d have to say that I really don&apos;t give much of a damn<br/>what Paul Erlich might do (or not do) musically when I read 99% of his<br/>post - and I think that that&apos;s OK... because I don&apos;t seem to have much<br/>of a problem differentiating between what I&apos;m looking for, or am<br/>interested in in his posts, and what I&apos;m personally interested in in<br/>my own musical or artistic aesthetics.</p><p>Dan</p></div><h3><a id=5287 href="#5287">ðŸ”—</a>Drew Skyfyre &#x3C;drew_skyfyre@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/1999 10:27:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan, that must have been a heck of a profound experience :-)</p><p>&gt; (As I&apos;ve said before,) I personally believe that the TD benefits<br/>&gt; greatly from someone like Paul, i.e., someone whom has both the<br/>&gt; technical skill knowledge &amp; know-how, and a nearly daily desire to<br/>&gt; wade through all this stuff for any slack in the facts (so to speak).</p><p>Aye ! Never mind that with many of us, our eyes glaze over when confronted<br/>with some of the extreme theoretical banter. Unfortunately that sort of<br/>stuff appears to drive some people into unsubscribing. Now, I certainly<br/>don&apos;t pretend to understand all that goes on here, but that&apos;s o.k. Maybe<br/>some of it&apos;ll rub off. And, I get the digest version, so it&apos;s just one email<br/>with all the message topics nicely at the top, so I know exactly what I need<br/>to look at right away, while leaving the rest to glance at when i have spare<br/>time.</p><p>There are a lot more microtonalists out there than the 350 or so that r on<br/>this list. And even stranger is how few of those 350 ever speak up, even if<br/>it&apos;s with the most basic questions, or whatever. I was dissapointed to see<br/>Neil sign off.</p><p>&gt; And as long as this doesn&apos;t create an atmosphere where genuinely<br/>&gt; interested people are perhaps wary of posting for fear of being made<br/>&gt; to appear as though they don&apos;t know what their talking about,<br/>Yes ! This is a real danger, maybe Nowitzky should put a little note in the<br/>welcome message about how it&apos;s o.k. to ask questions of any level, as long<br/>as it has something to do with alternate tuning.</p><p>- Drew</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Bid and sell for free at <a href="http://auctions.yahoo.com">http://auctions.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=5307 href="#5307">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>10/7/1999 10:05:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>tuners!<br/>    As enough of the last few post have stated how some of the dialog is &quot;over<br/>their Heads&quot; i would request that instead of sitting back and oohing and<br/>aahhhing that you have the guts to say so! To assume that just because they are<br/>saying things that one does not understand it must be important or valid is<br/>dangerous. It leaves the door open for a self appointed elite to intimidate<br/>others into submission by a specialized language. I am not saying that this is<br/>what is going on. I find time and again that i have to ask for explanations and<br/>would appreciate others to do so as this list is for all of us. I also firmly<br/>believe that one learns much by explaining something to someone else and those<br/>who know can appreciate the opportunity to explain. This is a tuning list of<br/>music practitioners not higher math. some things can be learn by the latter but<br/>those should be put into a form suitable to musicians and composers!<br/>    I have to end with a paraphrase from Diogenes of plato.
