Being so, he is not going to gpo public with  anything until he has taken<br/>it further along.<br/>We have stuff going back to 1996 which he is holding onto for the moment. Just to give you an<br/>idea of the backlog. Still there is so much to study in Scale tree itself  that enough remains<br/>untapped. I believe the acoustic interest him less in the fact they don&apos;t form horagrams with<br/>the properties like dan sterns is interested. They do make MOS scales but what doesn&apos;t. He is<br/>very tied up getting ready for his trip to mexico. I such times , it is hard to get him to<br/>stop what he is doing , to back track 7 or 8 years. I myself have my own confusion in this<br/>territory that prevents me from pulling one out of my hat. I will check if possible if there<br/>is already one in existence up that we aren&apos;t seeing!</p><p>&quot;Paul H.

But, while you were away, Dave and Margo brought up the acoustic<br/>noble means because they seem very often to be extremely close to the &quot;most<br/>dissonant&quot; interval within a certain range. Dave and Margo have been<br/>discussing ways of altering the fifths in a Gothic application of<br/>Pythagorean tuning so that the thirds come out &quot;maximally dissonant&quot;. Hence<br/>an application of the acoustic noble means to scale generation.</p></div>
