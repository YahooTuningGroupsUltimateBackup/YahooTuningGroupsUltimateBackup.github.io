Instead it is the ratio of the fret-to-nut<br/>distance to the scale length that tells you (inversely) the ratio of the<br/>frequencies of the fretted note to the open string. Since you&apos;re looking at<br/>a just fretting, you&apos;d be better off fropping cents altogether and just<br/>looking at the distance ratios -- that should make things clear.</p></div>
