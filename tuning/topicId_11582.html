Erlich;<br/>    I find it interesting that the preferred rate of beating between &quot;unisons&quot; is between 6-16<br/>in Java and Bali.  This beating third, like vibrato, could be preferred by some?<br/>                                                                    Banaphshu</p><p>&quot;Paul H. Erlich&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Johnny wrote,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Paul, it is not what I &quot;like&quot; but what might be inherent in the the 81/64<br/>&gt; &gt;that allowed it to remain in practice for so long.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let&apos;s explore what&apos;s inherent in it. As far as I can tell, the only thing<br/>&gt; inherent in it, and the only reason it (or some approximation of it)<br/>&gt; remained in practice through the Medieval era, is that it can be built up<br/>&gt; from 4 fifths. When tuning 81/64 by itself, without reference to the<br/>&gt; intervening fifths, I can&apos;t discern any characteristics that distinguish it<br/>&gt; from its immediate neighbors. It was not considered a consonance in the<br/>&gt; Medieval era, so its tuning would have been determined by melodic factors,<br/>&gt; which would probably have kept it in the rough vicinity of 81/64, though<br/>&gt; Marchettus and others suggested that it was larger in certain progressions .<br/>&gt; . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Consider, wouldn&apos;t there only be an octave and a half of range in the<br/>&gt; &gt;Pythagorean men&apos;s voices?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll let Margo answer that, but assuming you&apos;re right, major thirds at the<br/>&gt; top of the range would beat more than twice as fast as those in the bottom.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I suggest this.  So, if 16 beats per second make<br/>&gt; &gt;up thirds in a 3/2, then most other thirds (which will have smaller major<br/>&gt; &gt;thirds) will have less of a frequency than 16?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m confused about your meaning. But a Pythagorean major third only beats 16<br/>&gt; times per second if the lower note is a modern middle C. That&apos;s near the top<br/>&gt; of my range. An octave lower, a Pythagorean major third beats 8 times per<br/>&gt; second. Wouldn&apos;t that fall into the category you described as &quot;egregious&quot;?<br/>&gt; Meanwhile, a 12-tET major third with the lower note at modern middle C beats<br/>&gt; 10 times per second . . . and yet today everyone (people I&apos;ve talked to<br/>&gt; about it, Blackwood, me, etc.) seems to find the 12-tET major third more<br/>&gt; consonant than the Pythagorean major third, in any register . . . or shall<br/>&gt; we conduct more listening experiments?</p><p>-- Banaphshu<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div>
