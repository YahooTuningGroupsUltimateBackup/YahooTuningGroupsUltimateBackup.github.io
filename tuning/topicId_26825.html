It is already the<br/>&gt; 19th harmonic to such a close approximation that the difference is<br/>&gt; totally negligible (1 or 2 cents? I forget and don&apos;t have the means<br/>&gt; on hand to calculate it). Historically, at the same time composers<br/>&gt; began to employ the minor mode MUCH more fequently than before. The<br/>&gt; acquaintance I mentioned believes this is no mere coincidence.</p><p>Hi Bob,</p><p>Allow me to respectfully state that I have a few reservations about<br/>what you say here.</p><p>I just posted something a few days ago about Eratosthenes&apos;s descriptions<br/>of tetrachord tunings using 19 as a factor in the ratios:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_26618.html#26618">/tuning/topicId_26618.html#26618</a><br/>Date:  Thu Aug 2, 2001  6:31 pm<br/>Subject:  ratios in ancient Greek tetrachords</p><p>Eratosthenes made use of what I call the &quot;3==19 bridge&quot;,<br/>the ratio 1216/1215  = ~1.424297941 cents.  In other words,<br/>he calculated 19-limit ratios for his tetrachord pitches<br/>which are audibly indistinguishable from 3-limit &quot;Pythagorean&quot;<br/>ratios already in common use.</p><p>And centuries or possibly millennia before Eratosthenes,<br/>a music-theorist analyzing 19-limit ratios would have found<br/>that 19/16 is very nearly the same as the common Pythagorean<br/>&quot;minor 3rd&quot; with the ratio 32/27.  This is another 3==19 bridge<br/>which is a little over twice the size of Eratosthenes&apos;s<br/>(or about 3&amp;1/3 cents).</p><p>I would say that these 3==19 bridges take historical precedence<br/>over the 2^(3/12)==19 bridge you discuss here, by well over<br/>1000 years.</p><p>In response to your statement that &quot;the difference is totally<br/>negligible (1 or 2 cents? I forget and don&apos;t have the means on<br/>hand to calculate it)&quot;: here&apos;s a table describing the deviation<br/>of 19/16 from both the 12-EDO and the Pythagorean &quot;minor 3rds&quot;:</p><p>            ratio       ~cents       delta cents<br/>                                     of 19/16 from this</p><p>2^(3/12)  1.189207115  300           -2.486983868<br/>19/16     1.1875       297.5130161<br/>32/27     1.185185185  294.1349974    3.378018728</p><p>In *both* cases, the difference would be almost always be inaudible<br/>(except for the rare musical contexts in which it could be heard clearly).</p><p>So what I&apos;m saying here is that anyone who used a &quot;minor triad&quot;<br/>with the ratios 1/1 : 32/27 : 3/2 would be presenting a sound<br/>that&apos;s virtually indistinguishable from 1/1 : 19/16 : 3/2.</p><p>This could have happened as long ago as the Sumerian period<br/>(c. 3000 BC), if my speculations about Sumerian tuning are correct.<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/sumerian/sumeriantuning.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/sumerian/sumeriantuning.htm</a></p><p>(Of course, it could have happened even much earlier, but the<br/>Sumerian and Babylonian tablets are the earliest written record<br/>we&apos;ve found so far, and will probably remain so.)</p><p>Also, while 12-EDO began to be advocated around 1600, primarily<br/>for its facility in fretting the lute (which was by far the most<br/>commonly used instrument at that time), the &quot;virtually universal<br/>acceptance of 12t-ET&quot; didn&apos;t happen until only about 100 years ago.<br/>Many composers and performers held on to meantones and<br/>well-temperaments well into the 19th century.  So can you say<br/>more about the &quot;time composers began to employ the minor mode<br/>MUCH more frequently than before&quot;?</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
