Certainly I would<br/>not wish to imply that what I find beautiful for a 14th-century or<br/>derivative style would be equally appropriate for an 18th-century key<br/>system!</p><p>For example, major and minor thirds play vital roles both as stable<br/>concords in a 13th-century English piece such as _Sumer is i-cumen<br/>in_, and as unstable &quot;partial concords&quot; in 13th-century music from<br/>Continental Europe.</p><p>Similarly, Bach shows a keen appreciation for minor sevenths as<br/>unstable intervals, while they serve as stable concords in a system<br/>such as Paul Erlich&apos;s decatonic scale with tetrads of 4:5:6:7.</p><p>From this perspective, I would regard the conventions of an approach<br/>such as 18th-century well-temperament as reflecting a given musical<br/>style. The same interval sizes might be used with a different musical<br/>meaning in another style, or different sizes with analogous meaning.</p><p>Similarly, the 18th-century convention that major thirds should be not<br/>more than about a syntonic comma wider than 5:4 nicely fits a style<br/>based on the _trias harmonica_ with its ideal ratios of 4:5:6.</p><p>In a 21st-century neo-Gothic style where Pythagorean thirds may be the<br/>intonational norm, or thirds with simpler ratios at or near 9:7 and<br/>7:6, very different conventions of intonation and well-temperament may<br/>apply.</p><p>As you observe, Monz, taste may differ even within a given stylistic<br/>setting. For example, I have found meantone minor thirds near 7:6<br/>quite &quot;concordant&quot; and pleasing for music in a &quot;Xeno-Renaissance&quot;<br/>manner, and Owen Jorgensen expresses the view that a narrow minor<br/>third does not become a &quot;Wolf,&quot; but rather is acceptable as<br/>representing a ratio somewhere near 7:6.</p><p>However, Nicola Vicentino (1555), in contrast, suggests that a minor<br/>third if narrower than its usual meantone size around 6:5 tends toward<br/>the &quot;dissonance&quot; of a major second, and so describes the &quot;minimal<br/>third&quot; or augmented second found on his _archicembalo_ or<br/>&quot;superharpsichord.&quot; In contrast, he finds a &quot;proximate minor third&quot; a<br/>diesis _larger_ than usual, which he describes as near 11:9, as rather<br/>&quot;concordant.&quot;</p><p>Having raised these points, I would emphasize the value of specific<br/>historical conventions such as those of 18th-century well-temperament<br/>as a guide to the styles for which they provide such an eloquent<br/>intonational expression.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/17/2001 3:10:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: mschulter &lt;<a href="mailto:MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET">MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 6:49 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: trias harmonica -- most recent responses<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, I suspect that my use of &quot;the Monz&quot; may reflect a certain<br/>&gt; playful intensification: &quot;As our one and only Monz has said...&quot;<br/>&gt; Is it possible that I might be influenced by reading some years ago<br/>&gt; about a character in some television drama known as &quot;the Fonz&quot;?</p><p>Sure... when I was younger and the TV show &quot;Happy Days&quot; was being<br/>aired, the character Arthur Fonzarelli, AKA &quot;Fonzie&quot; AKA &quot;The Fonz&quot;,<br/>was extremely popular, and friends joked about my name like that<br/>all the time.
