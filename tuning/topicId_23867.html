I think that will work for Ira...</p><p>HOWEVER, we were trying to get the Midi Relay to put the beginning of<br/>the blackjack scale on C4.</p><p>I took the blackjack file in Scala and mapped it to &quot;C-linear&quot; with<br/>load/map clinear, and I am sure it&apos;s working, since the &quot;0&quot; point of<br/>the scale is on 261 Hz, &quot;middle- C&quot;.</p><p>My TX81Z works GREAT with this and I &quot;DO&quot; have &quot;middle C,&quot; BUT the<br/>MIDI RELAY is doing something different.</p><p>How do we get the MIDI RELAY to recognize the &quot;load/map clinear&quot;<br/>so &quot;middle C&quot; is the first note of the blackjack scale?</p><p>We were getting something else...</p><p>Any help here, Graham, would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>________ ________ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>5/28/2001 12:56:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph Pehrson wrote:</p><p>&gt; How do we get the MIDI RELAY to recognize the &quot;load/map clinear&quot;<br/>&gt; so &quot;middle C&quot; is the first note of the blackjack scale?</p><p>Download the source code, get a copy of Borland C++ 5 and try to recompile<br/>it with this modification :(</p><p>&gt; We were getting something else...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any help here, Graham, would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>All scales are mapped starting with the lowest MIDI note (C-2 by my<br/>calculations, the key being C3=3C).  So to get it where you want, you have<br/>to work out what order the notes should start in for it to magically<br/>appear in the right place.</p><p>I think the tonic command might to the trick.  Here&apos;s a line I took from<br/>one of my schismic files:</p><p>tonic 48 8.455</p><p>The first number is the MIDI note taken to be note zero.  64 is middle C<br/>so</p><p>tonic 64 8.04</p><p>may work.  It&apos;s so long ago I can&apos;t even remember what my own software<br/>does, but I think this is the way :)  It has to be placed near the top of<br/>the scale.  Not being the Stradivarius of tuning software, you have to<br/>watch out for blank lines in tuning files as well, even at the end.</p><p>                           Graham</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/28/2001 1:51:20 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; Joseph Pehrson wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; How do we get the MIDI RELAY to recognize the &quot;load/map clinear&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; so &quot;middle C&quot; is the first note of the blackjack scale?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We were getting something else...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Any help here, Graham, would be greatly appreciated!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All scales are mapped starting with the lowest MIDI note (C-2 by my<br/>&gt; calculations,</p><p>It seemed that on Joseph&apos;s keyboard, the mapping would be beginning<br/>an octave below C0, so C -1.</p><p>&gt; the key being C3=3C).</p><p>What do you mean by &quot;key&quot; here as opposed to &quot;note&quot; above?</p><p>&gt; So to get it where you want, you have<br/>&gt; to work out what order the notes should start in for it to<br/>magically<br/>&gt; appear in the right place.</p><p>Ah -- that shouldn&apos;t be too hard.</p></div><h3>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>5/28/2001 5:54:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; the key being C3=3C).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What do you mean by &quot;key&quot; here as opposed to &quot;note&quot; above?</p><p>It&apos;s the way I remember MIDI numbering, and I hope I haven&apos;t been getting<br/>it wrong all these years.  3C is hex for &lt;reaches for calculator&gt; 60.

Sure, if you&apos;re around that would be great,<br/>although most probably I will not be using the MIDI Relay for<br/>composing... I&apos;m using the synth set-up for that.
