Being<br/>new to this whole field, I find most of the discussion quite<br/>informative. I have, however, for a while now, shared the feeling that<br/>some (like Haverstick recently) have been pointing out recently; and<br/>that is the &quot;theory as an end to itself&quot; phenomenon. I don&apos;t wish to<br/>assume that those of you who are deeply involved with finding new<br/>structures are necessary non-musical, (I am a friend of Paul Erlich&apos;s,<br/>and I can safely say he is anything BUT non-musical!) but I do feel<br/>that sometimes I don&apos;t quite see the goal of all the discussion.</p><p> Basially, I believe that scale structures, harmonic concepts (limits,<br/>etc.) exist within the universe of sound as we experiece it; it is up<br/>to us to tap into these already existing phenomena. Furthermore, I beleive<br/>that the search for &quot;more&quot; is infinite. The question that<br/>really arises in my mind is &quot;what do you do with something when you<br/>&apos;find&apos; it?&quot;. If you notice a rose blooming by the side of your porch<br/>one morning, do you<br/>a) compare it to the many others you&apos;re used to seeing?<br/>b) analyze the angle of the petals and the hues of color?<br/>c) smell it, touch it, admire it, give it to your girlfriend.</p><p>I would take (c). The equivalent of (c) to me is to create music, not<br/>&quot;describe&quot; it. I do not wish to imply that the abstractions necessary<br/>to understand a complex phenomenon are useless. What I mean is that I<br/>feel that they need to be put into use. And especially for those of<br/>you with a &quot;political non-12TET&quot; bent, this is the ONLY way to get<br/>musicians and composers to understand what you are pointing to.</p><p>To use an analogy someone used recently, a blueprint of a bridge<br/>cannot provide all of the following information:  a) be functionally<br/>safe and useful, b) be aesthetically coherent with the geographic setting<br/>it is<br/>to be built in, c) whether it is actually necessary to HAVE a bridge<br/>there to begin with. These things are done by engineers, urban<br/>planners and representatives of the community together. Having a<br/>library of bridge blueprints is nice for those who would like to go to<br/>a library and browse through all possible bridges that they COULD<br/>have, but unless the enterprise is a JOINT one with all groups<br/>mentioned above, it is merely an exercise. Perhaps a beautiful one,<br/>yet still an exercise.</p><p>On a slightly different note (A442, to be exact), I think two<br/>approaches to music making that I personally am aware of (and i don&apos;t<br/>mean to exclude any other traditions which I may very well be ignorant<br/>of), may help you understand what I am getting at.</p><p>One is found in the model that is prevalent in western music. The<br/>dominance of counterpoint, harmonic modulation and thematic variation<br/>in this tradition relegates the &quot;consonances&quot; or, indeed, any<br/>identifiable pitch group to symbolic entities. no longer is the<br/>&quot;point&quot; of the music the purely physical sensation of preceiving the<br/>pitch group or following a melodic &quot;narrative&quot;,  but rather it is the role<br/>the &apos;triad&apos; or any other chosen pitch group  plays in the larger &apos;drama&apos;<br/>that is set in the music.<br/>The questions that are interesting in my mind are &quot;how can different<br/>representations of these &quot;pitch groups&quot; (for the lack of a better<br/>term), meaning different levels of pure/tempered intervals be used to<br/>create the movement/drama prevalent in this tradition? Is the &quot;drama&quot;<br/>or &quot;natural narrative &quot; (again, for the lack of better terms...)<br/>fundamentally altered when placed within the confines of one tuning or<br/>another? This i think can be done through analysis of MUSIC and the<br/>composition of MUSIC. No chart or lattice can do this.</p><p>The second approach is found in musical traditions where the &quot;drama&quot;<br/>or &quot;movement&quot; aspect of a musical work is less emphasized, giving way<br/>to a more serene enjoyment of the modes/scales/chords produced by the<br/>tuning used by a given tradition. (And by no means do I consider this a<br/>&quot;lesser&quot; form of music making). I am thinking of my own musical<br/>heritage (armenian music), as well as georgian, persian, arabic, and I<br/>suppose Indian music (though I do not wish to diminish the complexity<br/>found in this latter tradition by any means). Here the &quot;drama&quot; becomes<br/>the subtle melodic inflections and the overall consonance/dissonance<br/>play, often presented with the juxtaposition of various notes<br/>belonging to a &quot;pitch group&quot; (again, for the lack of a better term),<br/>against a drone (which can be a shifting drone and does not have to be<br/>static by any means). Here again, the various colours and shadings<br/>produced by the chosen &quot;pitch group&quot; can only be transmitted to other<br/>human beings through music. a melody, an inflection, or even just a<br/>drone of two pitches.  No analysis can convey the truth that is within the<br/>music.</p><p>Finally, knowing that some comments seem to produce a climate of slight<br/>&apos;hostility&apos; on this list , let me emphasize that I do not wish to diminish<br/>anyone&apos;s efforts to explore structures and theories, but instead to give<br/>support only to support others who, it appears, share my thoughts on the<br/>subject. I do not wish to get into arguments. That is BORING. Exchange of<br/>thoughts, however, sounds like a good idea.</p></div>
