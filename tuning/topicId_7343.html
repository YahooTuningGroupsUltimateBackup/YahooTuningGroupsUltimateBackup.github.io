I certainly would not hesitate to call an interval<br/>of 1203 cents a *tempered* &apos;octave&apos;, or even one quite a<br/>bit larger than that.  I read among Brian McLaren&apos;s voluminous<br/>writings, referring to acoustical studies he&apos;d read, that<br/>*all* intervals are considered by listeners to be at their<br/>most consonant when tuned slightly larger than small-integer<br/>ratios, and he specifically cited the 1215-cent &apos;octave&apos; as<br/>being the &apos;octave&apos; that listeners considered the most consonant.<br/>That&apos;s one reason why Brian is so interested in UDNO tunings.</p><p>But I think that for purposes of terminological exactness,<br/>we should stick to a precise 1:2 &apos;octave&apos; for EDO/UDO,<br/>and use EDNO/UDNO for all tempered &apos;octaves&apos;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; EDO<br/>&gt;&gt; ---<br/>&gt;&gt; ET (= equal-temperament and equal tuning)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since I&apos;ve been playing recently with scales that have<br/>&gt; slightly tempered octaves (but not enough that I would<br/>&gt; consider them as &quot;non-octave&quot; scales), I think it makes<br/>&gt; sense to allow for some flexibility in the definition of<br/>&gt; &quot;octave&quot;.

Gives us more info!</p><p>This is all I have specifically on the tuning, from the liner notes of the<br/>CD from KOCH International Classics (3-7369-2-H1):</p><p>&quot;My _Sonata for Microtonal Piano_ deploys chains of just-tuned (untempered)<br/>triadic intervals over the whole piano range in interlocked consonant<br/>patterns. Only seven of the eighty-eight white and black keys of the piano<br/>have octave equivalents, one pair encompassing the distance of a double<br/>octave and the remaining six pairs separated by almost the entire length of<br/>the keyboard. Thus there are eighty-one different pitches, providing a<br/>piano with almost no consonant octaves.&quot;</p><p>--<br/>see my music page ---&gt;   +--&lt;<a href="http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html">http://www.io.com/~hmiller/music/music.html</a>&gt;--<br/>      Thryomanes        /&quot;If all Printers were determin&apos;d not to print any<br/>   (Herman Miller)     / thing till they were sure it would offend no body,<br/>   moc.oi @ rellimh &lt;-/  there would be very little printed.&quot; -Ben Franklin</p></div><h3><a id=7456 href="#7456">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@xx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/1999 7:55:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, 31 Dec 1999 03:09:32 +0000, &quot;Drew Skyfyre&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:skyfyre2@yahoo.com">skyfyre2@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Isn&apos;t Lucytuning a meantone scale?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Herman, a tuning can be many different things.<br/>&gt;So, tuning X may be a meantone, and an EDNO.</p><p>But it can&apos;t be an EDNO if in fact it has octaves.</p></div><h3><a id=7468 href="#7468">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/31/1999 1:04:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; [Drew Skyfyre, TD 466.15]<br/>&gt; a tuning can be many different things.  So, tuning X may be<br/>&gt; a meantone, and an EDNO. Daniel recently pointed out how a<br/>&gt; given EDO and ET may be physically identical, but conceptually<br/>&gt; different.<br/>&gt; The intent in a given application is what defines the tuning<br/>&gt; in that particular situation.</p><p>I think the most admirably crafted expositions illustrating<br/>this are Margo Schulter&apos;s articles posted here.<br/>They&apos;re work printing and saving: go visit the Archives.</p><p>&gt; [Drew]<br/>&gt; Is there a name for tunings that do not repeat, i.e. are<br/>&gt; *endless* ?  88CET is an example of such a tuning (I think).<br/>&gt; Perhap keeping with the &quot;ED_&quot; family, they may be called &quot;EDS&quot;<br/>&gt; for Equal Divisions of (or, in) the (audio) Spectrum, which is<br/>&gt; infinite.</p><p>I like the poetry of &apos;EDS&apos;, but 88-cet can already be classified<br/>as EDNO.  The &apos;octave&apos; in a EDO or UDO is what creates the<br/>repetition to which you refer.  The non-repetition in 88-cet<br/>is due to it lack of &apos;octaves&apos;, thus EDNO.</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
