Obviously there is successive apps of 5, perhaps up to 25. But there is also a 9 note scale/chord which comes from adding 4&apos;s. This is interesting because 8 gives an interval very close to 7/6, the flattened (harmonic) minor third, yet this scale also includes 12 and its compliment 24 which forms an augmented triad. So we have a type of &quot;dim-aug&quot; chord together. Knowing how both apply to standard harmony (eg Jazz), usually substituting the dominant chord, I thought this might give us a &quot;way in&quot; to include 25 in cycling etc...</p><p>PS: Aaron (AKA AKJ) also mentioned that PHI could give us key centres which are maximum distances apart, much like it is used in nature to separate the leaves of plants to gain maximum sunlight (forget the word, Phyllo-something). I have a vague idea that we could begin with the key at 25 and, using more or less standard chords, go through a long cycle back to 0 (similar to starting with Gb half-dim, the most distant key from C in 12 EDO, and cycling back to C maj).</p><p>-Rick</p></div><h3>Daniel Forro &#x3C;dan.for@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/2009 6:53:18 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If you mean a Gb half dimished scale, then:</p><p>- it&apos;s not a key, it&apos;s only scale (enharmonically F#-G#-A-B-C-D-E, based on half diminished chord F#-A-C-E).
