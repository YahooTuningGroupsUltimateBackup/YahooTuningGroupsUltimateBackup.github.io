I&apos;ve related the story of a very talented<br/>&quot;young woman&quot; I knew in high school. She did these awesome D Dorian<br/>improvisations at the piano. Completely self-taught, that was her thing<br/>and she did it quite well.</p><p>That was her magic.</p><p>I don&apos;t know how far its taken her, but many<br/>musicians I have seen since then have used the &quot;black notes&quot; and<br/>different tonics than &quot;D&quot;, sometimes with magical results. Do you<br/>think that if one of them had showed her those notes she may have<br/>found some new magic, or additional magic to that she had?</p><p>But more importantly, what do you like? Have you been listenning<br/>to the posted music? Have you done some experiments with your<br/>ideas of consonance and purity? Have you made any progress on<br/>your new instrument?</p><p>I just play 12et guitar everyday and work alot on rhythm till<br/>my 31 tone guitar arrives... (anybody who can recommend metronomes<br/>that are good for Balkan rhythms let me know, I was reading about<br/>the DB-80 Dr Beat from Boss which can do everything from 1 to 15<br/>with two chimes...</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
