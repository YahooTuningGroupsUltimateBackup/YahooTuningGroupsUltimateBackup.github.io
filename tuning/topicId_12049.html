It&apos;s just the worst feeling to have one&apos;s web address<br/>tilda-fied.</p><p>Anyway, I feel obliged by the above commentary to put something<br/>tuning-relevant up for web-listening, so my piece &quot;Ooogaaah:<br/>Dungeony Specimen Spaceship&quot; can be found at</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/tunes.html">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris/tunes.html</a></p><p>Though the piece certainly deals with tuning issues, it was written (or<br/>&quot;realized&quot; as they say (it&apos;s electronic) ) before I got on the list here,<br/>and uses some techniques which I haven&apos;t really seen discussed on the list<br/>since I&apos;ve been on.  That being the case, I&apos;ll mention a bit about how I<br/>dealt with the tuning issues in it.</p><p> Basically,  I started from the standpoint of sound (harmonic) analysis,<br/>(starting with real live sounds and extracting musical/tuning data from<br/>them)  rather than &quot;synthesis&quot; (i.e. theorizing ideal objects and trying<br/>to realize them with real live sounds).</p><p>In the case of this piece,  I analyzed a particular sonority/moment/chord<br/>from an early 80&apos;s pop song (take a guess which one if you like),<br/>discovering it&apos;s &quot;spectrum&quot; which lies somewhere in between &quot;harmonic&quot; and<br/>&quot;inharmonic.&quot; (more towards the former) This &quot;ur-chord&quot; if you will,<br/>appears most explicitly towards the end of the piece in various guises<br/>(sung, played by quiet bells, etc.).  Now, just as composers using<br/>Just-Intonation often derive scales from the &quot;pure&quot; overtone series, so I<br/>treated this &quot;impure&quot; chord/sonority/moment-spectrum as a &quot;scale&quot; source,<br/>and derived about 20 random 7-note scales from it&apos;s pitches, and chose<br/>about 4 of those, by ear, to use in the piece.  The intervals of these<br/>scales are weird and arbitrary I guess, in fact I couldn&apos;t tell you what<br/>they are off the top of my head,  (though I can retrieve some exact values<br/>in cents if anyone&apos;s interested) but they seemed to make good aural<br/>sense/contrast to me at the time. If you are familiar with the European<br/>&quot;spectral school&quot; of composers (Murail, Grisey, Hurel, etc.) you might<br/>think of what I did in this piece as a cross between<br/>&quot;spectral-(harmonic)-&quot; microtonality and the more &quot;tuning-(and therefore<br/>scale)-oriented&quot; microtonality that&apos;s discussed on on the list here.</p><p> There&apos;s a lot of other garbage in the piece too, samples,<br/>random noisey stuff, etc.</p><p>Anyway, enjoy.</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div>
