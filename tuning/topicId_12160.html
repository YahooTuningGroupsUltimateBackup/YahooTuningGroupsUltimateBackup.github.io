Sometimes I love to put this on and play it<br/>really loud just to bathe in the wonderful microtonal inflections and<br/>multiphonics. Also, let&apos;s not forget Ornette and quite a bit of<br/>Albert Ayler too, where there is rarely a piano being used. But hey -<br/>I must admit here too that I really love McCoy Tyner on any album, he<br/>just offers a wonderful tempered contrast that allows Coltrane&apos;s<br/>exotic inflections to be most profoundly perceived.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I was thinking of<br/>&gt; Coltrane whose scales often seem to be quite removed from the Piano.</p></div><h3><a id=12204 href="#12204">ðŸ”—</a>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2000 11:54:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig Grady wrote,</p><p>&gt; I was referring to the practice of how horn players treat the whole<br/>scale as greatly movable and flexible regardless of what is<br/>underneath.

When you say it&apos;s beyond the tolerance of your limits, do<br/>you mean that only in the context of your music and what your trying<br/>to do, or do you mean that you don&apos;t necessarily approve of it in even<br/>in the broader sense? Probably both I would imagine... Though it does<br/>almost always happen by some accident of circumstance, as in the<br/>Coltrane example -- or say Hunn-Hurr-Tu (where Kuvezin&apos;s guitar is the<br/>&quot;accident of circumstance&quot;) -- I do think it&apos;s fascinating (though<br/>that may have something to do with the fact that it&apos;s closer to some<br/>of what I do), and that it really speaks for malleability of tuning<br/>when it comes to inspired people making inspiring music... and not<br/>that that&apos;s any sort of an excuse for the mass-produced instruments of<br/>12-tET landing in places were they most likely wouldn&apos;t windup under<br/>anything other than a somewhat dubious circumstance, but I do think<br/>that the Coltranes or Partches of the world will always make stunning<br/>musics no matter where they eventually find or place themselves<br/>intonation wise. Personally, I&apos;m much more interested in inspiring<br/>music than I am tuning; though if I happen to find both at the same<br/>address I&apos;m definitely a happy man!</p><p>Dan</p></div>
