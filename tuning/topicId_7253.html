It&apos;s actually kind of cool as an electronic effect, but<br/> not what happens with real instruments. &gt;&gt;</p><p>It sure can happen with real instruments: I have heard this especially with<br/>wind and mixed wind/string ensembles where sustained unisons and octaves are<br/>important: the Mozart _Grand Partita_ (or _Serenade_) in B(b) for 13 winds,<br/>Elliot Carters _Eight Etudes and a Fantasy_, and Alvin Lucier&apos;s _Septet_.<br/>Also, the unison playing in Messiaen&apos;s _Quatour_ often has similar effects.</p></div><h3><a id=7256 href="#7256">ðŸ”—</a>DWolf77309@xx.xxx</h3><span>12/24/1999 5:42:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="mailto:clumma@nni.com">clumma@nni.com</a>:</p><p>&lt;&lt; I&apos;m simply stating that Barbershop is<br/> monophonic music, in the most normal, classical sense.  There are four<br/> parts and one voice.  As a 4-part fugue has four parts and four voices. &gt;&gt;</p><p>The terms mono-, poly-, homo- or heterophonic often get a bit confused (and<br/>that confusion has taken up a good part of the history of systematic<br/>musicology). Perhaps it&apos;s clearest to remeber that the first two refer to the<br/>number of participating voices, the second pair characterize the overall<br/>textures.</p><p>Lou Harrison usefully recommends distinguishing between &quot;differentiated&quot; and<br/>&quot;undifferentiated&quot; counterpoint.  Traditional lutheran chorale settings --<br/>like barbershop -- are mostly undifferentiated in that the voices share the<br/>same rhythm while Bach&apos;s chorale setting are often differentiated.<br/>Differences between lutheran chorales and barbershop comes in the harmonic<br/>vocabulary (almost only seventh chords in the latter) and alternative voice<br/>leading restrictions.</p><p>&lt;&lt; The best brass quintets are The Empire Brass, The<br/>Canadian Brass, and the American Brass Quintet.  None of them remain as<br/>continuously in JI as the best Barbershop quartets, and none of them use<br/>the 7-limit, whereas all Barbershop quartets are firmly 7-limit.&gt;&gt;</p><p>It&apos;s not the ensembles in question that have a limit, it&apos;s the music that<br/>they play. Those brass ensembles are all playing very broad range of<br/>repertoire, with much more variety than the three minute song format,<br/>constant seventh chord planing characteristic of barbershop music.  (By the<br/>way, the best brass ensembles today are the (amateur) brass bands in<br/>England.)</p><p>If you go back to WWII era recordings during the period when the musician&apos;s<br/>union refused to allow instrumentals, you can find some fantastic<br/>unaccompanied vocal ensemble performances with real intonational virtuosity,<br/>particularly by African-American groups: try the Golden Gate Quartet for<br/>starters.  Also very much worth hearing are the &quot;Madrigals&quot; of William<br/>Brooks, especially as performed by Electric Phoenic; one of the four<br/>madrigals, a setting of Stephen Foster&apos;s _Nelly was a Lady_ , demonstrates<br/>just how far beyond the constraint of the barbershop style one might<br/>potentially go.</p></div>
