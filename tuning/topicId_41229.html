Again,<br/>this process of internalizing a sound having experienced its touch is something quite constant for all of<br/>us and the choice to revisit a sound like the scale you mentioned, in my view is a choice to return to the<br/>space created by that sensation.        ??<br/>--</p><p>--</p></div><h3><a id=41334 href="#41334">ðŸ”—</a>Pierre Lamothe &#x3C;plamothe@aei.ca&#x3E;</h3><span>12/2/2002 11:58:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>(Sorry for delay)</p><p>?? wrote:<br/>  ... these strong, regional &quot;tone systems&quot; do have everything to do with &quot;here and now.&quot;<br/>  ... the choice for a tone group did at one point happen in one moment that created the group ...<br/>  ... the sensation of that group became invested within the people who heard it and somehow<br/>  resonated so deeply with them and their collective culture that the sound became a part of<br/>  the here and now ...<br/>  ... this process of internalizing a sound having experienced its touch is something quite<br/>  constant for all of us<br/>  ... the choice to revisit a sound like the scale ... is a choice to return to the space created<br/>  by that sensation<br/>1) I don&apos;t disagree that &quot;here and now&quot; would imply some internalized habits but I leave to others some<br/>judgment in that matter.

It seems that<br/>many here wish they would escape 12-ET but would keep diatonism and temperament way of thinking.<br/>Would you interpret that as a consequence of a such internalization?</p><p>4) I can hardly accept the term sensation in my vocabulary. On one hand, as far as I seek to track<br/>something that would be an elementary sensation, say the red sensation, I find relations, for instance<br/>the importance of the background / foreground, the cultural diversity of limits about the red category, etc.<br/>On the other hand, qualities appears always finest far from quantities and far from elementary level, as<br/>fused globality, like the face of things. So I see an elementary sensation as a regressive perception in<br/>artificial conditions of forced attention.</p><p>You&apos;re sit on a bench aside a person and your knees are touching. If that person is a nice girl at ease<br/>with you or that kind of guy who always need much place, you would probably have different percepts<br/>and affects, even if by regressive attention you could&apos;nt find a distinct sensation.</p><p>5) A mental space is something relational. It&apos;s constructed with quality differences (and some concrete<br/>law of transformation of these differences) rather than qualities as such.</p><p>Pierre</p></div>
