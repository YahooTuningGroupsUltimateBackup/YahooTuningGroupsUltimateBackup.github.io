Hopefully some are available.</p><p>Personally, reading your note, I think you&apos;d enjoy 20-tone<br/>and 16-tone (two which I, an old-hat Crimson freak,<br/>like using in my own tunes).  They work well in<br/>cyclical root movements popular in the prog<br/>format you mentioned.</p><p>I will mail you, if you like, a cassette of some<br/>snippets of both those tunings.</p><p>regretfully I can&apos;t give you advice on placing frets -<br/>I&apos;m a percussionist.<br/>cheers</p><p>Rick Sanford<br/>Manhattan</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;stearns@xxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>8/5/1999 9:22:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Wim Hoogewerf:]<br/>&gt; Since the death of Vogt one of his former disciples, Herv&#xFFFD; R.<br/>Chouard continued his work under the name Fret mobile.

Picking a tuning<br/>is a pretty subjective decision. If you&apos;re going to do the<br/>work yourself, you always have the option to do it over<br/>if you don&apos;t like the results.

It&apos;s not like you can&apos;t modulate in<br/>JI, it just isn&apos;t the same thing.</p><p>&gt; I guess what I&apos;m really asking for is opinions.<br/>&gt; I would like a tuning that isn&apos;t just some<br/>&gt; &quot;better Western tuning&quot;.
