Do you mean to say you could retune, say,<br/>&gt;one of Jay&apos;s tracks of Christmas music?  How much CPU does that take?</p><p>Sorry if I left the wrong impression.<br/>I doubt that retuning a full composition from a sound file is possible,<br/>if by this one means transposing each &quot;voice&quot; in an independent<br/>way. My stuff, (along with everyone else doing retuning) only works<br/>effectively on monophonic timbres/sounds/instruments. So, if one had<br/>a kind of master tape in which each voice was on a different track,<br/>then yes, it would likely be do-able, but if the voices are already<br/>mixed down to stereo, then probably no.</p><p>I was replying to your question about the technique of<br/>transforming a sound with an FFT, and then mapping the partials<br/>(which is one way of doing pitch shift), and then transforming<br/>back into a sound.<br/>My interest in the technique (and the focus of the<br/>CMJ paper), was to move the partials around so that they became<br/>more consonant with a set of desired scale intervals - for instance,<br/>suppose you wanted to work in 10-tet. The nearest thing to a fifth<br/>is at 720 cents, which tends to sound very out-of-tune<br/>when used with harmonic timbres. But if you move some of<br/>the partials around (for instance, move the third harmonic<br/>to near 720 cents, instead of near 700 cents), then the<br/>roughness is greatly attenuated. But the technique also is good for<br/>straight pitch transposition (over short intervals, like all<br/>pitch changing techniques).</p><p>&gt;&gt;the article also has a CD so you can hear some of the possible<br/>&gt;&gt;effects and side effects...</p><p>&gt;Where can one get this CD?</p><p>It was distributed with the last issue of 1998 CMJ<br/>(their CDs come out once a year, &quot;illustrating&quot; the articles<br/>from that year.) Alternatively, there is quite similar stuff on<br/>the CD that comes with my book, Tuning Timbre Spectrum Scale.<br/>(the sound examples illustrating the spectral mappings chapter).</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div><h3><a id=6673 href="#6673">ðŸ”—</a>Clark &#x3C;caccola@xxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/6/1999 2:17:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>William Sethares wrote:</p><p>&gt; I doubt that retuning a full composition from a sound file is possible,<br/>&gt; if by this one means transposing each &quot;voice&quot; in an independent<br/>&gt; way.</p><p>What about with Kelly Fitz&apos; LemurPro for Mac?
