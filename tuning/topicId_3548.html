Finnamore and those others who have done empirical<br/>&gt; testing of a capella tuning. While I am anxious to find out more through<br/>&gt; such testing, my own experience with choirs leads me to believe that,<br/>&gt; unless you are talking about the Hilliard Ensemble or Anonymous 4 or some<br/>&gt; other professional specialists in early choral chamber music, it is for<br/>&gt; practical purposes meaningless to speak of tuning systems in choral music<br/>&gt; with the same precision that we do with keyboards.</p><p>Anonymous 4 comin&apos; atcha!  So happens I&apos;m a big fan of<br/>theirs and have a few CDs. :-)</p><p>Well, ladies and gents, the pendulum has swung the other<br/>direction.  Unlike the Spanish monks, Anonymous 4 do not<br/>seem to use 5-limit JI, at least not on the one piece I&apos;ve<br/>looked at so far.  It&apos;s a real &quot;English&quot; sounding melody to<br/>me, with ample reason to tune in 5-lim.  For a note-by-note<br/>look at the entire monophonic chant, and a preliminary<br/>attempt at an analysis of the tuning, see:</p><p><a href="http://www.tcinternet.net/users/jfinnamore/df/a4ll_1chart1.html">http://www.tcinternet.net/users/jfinnamore/df/a4ll_1chart1.html</a></p><p>Included is a table of the center frequency of each note,<br/>the interval in cents between each adjacent note, and an<br/>attempt to analyze it as far as possible (not very) in<br/>5-limit JI.  On an accompanying page is the spectrograph of<br/>the first verse.</p><p>To come:<br/>1) A chart of &quot;stats&quot; such as how many intervals appear to<br/>be 3-limit, 5-limit, and &quot;other,&quot; and how they compare<br/>statistically to the expected intervals of a theoretical<br/>5-limit tuning.<br/>2) MIDI files of the melody in 12t-ET, Pythag, and 5-lim.<br/>3) Possibly a version of the spectrograph with frequency<br/>marks and lines showing how the overtones miss the Just mark<br/>most of the time.</p><p>Don&apos;t wait, there&apos;s lots to digest as it is!</p><p>David</p></div>
