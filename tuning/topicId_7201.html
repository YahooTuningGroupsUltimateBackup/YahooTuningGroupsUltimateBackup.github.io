However, I got a message that my mail had be<br/>&quot;returned since the mailbox is full...&quot; so sent the posts again.</p><p>I wonder if anyone else has experienced this phenominon?...  In any case I<br/>will ignore these messages in the future until provenly unposted...</p><p>[BTW -- I was a bit intuitive.  How did I somehow know that the WOLF was<br/>composing in MEAN-tone?? Sounds very interesting and would enjoy hearing.<br/>However, a stop in the Black Forest is, unfortunately, not on my Holiday<br/>itinerary at the moment...]</p><p>Looking forward to some further explanation of pivot &quot;homophones&quot; in 12-tET<br/>as contrasted/compared with the &quot;homophones&quot; of JI...  How is modulation<br/>effected??  Do the roots change and all the pitches (suggested by someone<br/>regarding an &quot;adaptive&quot; JI program) upon modulation, or should the<br/>&quot;homophone&quot; adjust??  I guess that would be a contradiction in terms...</p><p>Can there really be traditional &quot;pivot modulation&quot; or functional harmony in<br/>&quot;adaptive&quot; Just Intonation?</p><p>Quite frankly, I have heard very little JI that has modulations in it.  Am<br/>I missing something??  Certain composers??  How can I hear this...(if it<br/>exists)</p><p>Thanks, group!!</p></div><h3>Paul H.

Unison vectors (very<br/>small JI intervals) lead to exceptions, but then you&apos;re really using JI as a<br/>temperament, and once you&apos;ve crossed that line, distributing the unison<br/>vectors out by tempering the consonances by fractions of the unison vectors<br/>generally seems desirable.</p><p>&gt;Can there really be traditional &quot;pivot modulation&quot; or functional harmony in<br/>&gt;&quot;adaptive&quot; Just Intonation?</p><p>Absolutely. Strict JI poses greater problems here.</p></div>
