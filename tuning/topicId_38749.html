-- should be writing to me at my regular email:<br/>monz(AT)<a href="http://attglobal.net">attglobal.net</a></p><p>i felt your frustration, both in your private emails to me<br/>and in the tuning list post i&apos;m replying to now, but getting<br/>that heavily involved in my website again is not something<br/>i&apos;m likely to do for a little while yet.  except for a few<br/>little updates to existing pages, the only thing new i&apos;ve<br/>added is a page about my latest obsession:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/radian/mybike.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/radian/mybike.htm</a></p><p>meantime ...</p><p>Christopher, thanks for the plug for my book.  and Sarn,<br/>i think he&apos;s giving good advice here.  i haven&apos;t done<br/>any new editing of my book since i began my website back<br/>in 1998, so it&apos;s quite messy ... but it *is* much more<br/>sequential than the webpages, first introducing the<br/>prime-factor notation and some of my theories/ideas about<br/>prime numbers (but not as much as what&apos;s in the Dictionary,<br/>as i formulated those ideas later), then taking the reader<br/>on a journey thru historical tuning systems, sorted first<br/>by prime-limit, then, within each prime-limit, by chronology.</p><p>unfortunately all of my work on Sumerian and Babylonian<br/>tuning was only done two years ago, so there&apos;s hardly any<br/>of that in the book.  so the chronologies mostly begin<br/>with ancient Greek ideas about tuning.  also, i haven&apos;t<br/>included any of my work on Arabic and other Islamicate<br/>tunings, and there&apos;s not much there about China, and<br/>nothing about African, Native American, or other Asian<br/>music. so the bias pretty heavily favors the &quot;standard&quot;<br/>Euro-centric view of things, except for my inclusion of<br/>later American developments like the blues, jazz, and rock.</p><p>and finally, Bart, thanks for the suggestion of creating<br/>a site map.  i don&apos;t particularly know how to do that,<br/>unless it&apos;s an obvious simple thing (so the point is that<br/>the only website i&apos;ve ever designed is my own and the<br/>umbrella Sonic Arts site under which mine lives).  but<br/>eventually when i get back to working on the site in earnest,<br/>i&apos;ll make an attempt at that.  it&apos;s something Joe Pehrson<br/>has been begging me to provide for at least 3 years.</p><p>i realize that my site is a massive labyrinth of tangled<br/>tuning info (and some other stuff) ... but hey, it&apos;s a<br/>pretty accurate reflection of my mind!  ;-)</p><p>(... and, for that matter, my life as well ...)</p><p>now leave me alone! ... i&apos;m still on vacation ...</p><p>(and as paul likes to say, i still love all of you.)</p><p>-monz</p></div><h3>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2002 6:51:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Sarn Richard Ursell &lt;thcdelta@i...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/38749">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/38749</a></p><p>&gt; .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The main point of this email is to suggest, nae PLEAD with Mr.Joe<br/>Monzo to<br/>&gt; do an ADDITION to his website, and this would have a series of<br/>sequential<br/>&gt; step by step definitions and instructions, and little<br/>&gt; &quot;pop-quizzes/exams/tests&quot; spread throughout, like raisins in a bun.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Look, I really like Joe Monzo&apos;s site, but it is AMAZINGLY<br/>irritateing to try<br/>&gt; and, well, know where to start.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; Whilst it is not my intention to put Joe down, I just really find it<br/>&gt; irritateing to try and find out what it all means as a whole.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps its just me???.....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any advice Joe/Tuners?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>***Hello Sarn!</p><p>I&apos;m assuming you&apos;ve gone through all of Kyle Gann&apos;s stuff on the web,<br/>yes??
