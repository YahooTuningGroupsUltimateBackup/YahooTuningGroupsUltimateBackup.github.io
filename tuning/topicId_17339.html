Comma shifts, nuances, and special sonorities: a sampler<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>One feature as well as complication of a JI system combining pure<br/>ratios of 2, 3, and 7 is the septimal comma, the interval separating<br/>our two 12-note manuals in Pythagorean tuning (Eb-G#).</p><p>Here we consider some ways of approaching this comma of 64:63 (~27.26<br/>cents) from the viewpoint: &quot;If this be melodic unevenness, let us make<br/>the most of it.&quot;[13]<br/>&#x9;<br/>The following discussion attempts merely to sample some of the<br/>artistic possibilities of a system yet to be fully explored. In<br/>addition to focusing on progressions involving direct melodic comma<br/>shifts, we consider some alternative melodic nuances and related<br/>special sonorities and idioms.</p><p>---------------------------------------<br/>4.1. Comma shifts and changes of flavor<br/>---------------------------------------</p><p>Direct comma shifts may occur as a calculated artistic effort to<br/>maximize the subjective euphony or &quot;consonance&quot; of a cadential<br/>progression, or to make an already special progression yet more<br/>special.</p><p>They may also occur as a feature of &quot;musical geometry&quot; in certain<br/>standard sequences if we seek the simplest possible ratios for all<br/>vertical and melodic intervals.</p><p>Here we survey a few situations and idioms illustrating these diverse<br/>themes.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------<br/>4.1.1. Cadential euphony and the _tertia automotiva_<br/>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>One striking kind of direct septimal comma shift involves a change in<br/>cadential midstream, as it were, from a Pythagorean or 3-flavor major<br/>third (81:64, ~407.82 cents) to a pure 7-flavor version (9:7, ~435.08<br/>cents).[14] Here a carat sign (^) shows a note raised by a septimal<br/>comma above its usual Pythagorean position, and thus located on the<br/>upper keyboard manual of our 24-note tuning:</p><p>E4   F#^4  G4<br/>C#4  C#^4  D4<br/>A3         G3</p><p>This progression opens with a usual Pythagorean or 3-flavor sonority,<br/>the mildly unstable _quinta fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot; combining an outer<br/>fifth with a major and minor third, A3-C#4-E4, 64:81:96 or a rounded<br/>0-408-702 cents.</p><p>Above the unchanged lowest note A3, the two upper parts proceed to the<br/>pure 7-flavor version of the sixth sonority A3-C#^4-F#^4, 7:9:12 or<br/>0-435-933 cents, the major third and sixth then resolving in the usual<br/>expansive fashion to the fifth and octave of a complete trine<br/>G3-D4-G4.</p><p>This change of flavor involves, most notably, a direct 27-cent comma<br/>shift in the middle voice, C#4-C#^4. While this melodic shift is<br/>striking in itself, the aesthetic logic of the progression may reflect<br/>the somewhat ambivalent status of the pure 9:7 major third vis-a-vis<br/>the usual Pythagorean major third at 81:64. Mixing both flavors of<br/>this interval in the same cadential progression may serve to maximize<br/>perceived euphony or contexual consonance.</p><p>Although the 9:7 or 7-flavor major third has a purer and &quot;smoother&quot;<br/>ratio than the more complex 81:64, it may in many timbres and contexts<br/>actually seem more tense or urgent, or less subjectively &quot;concordant&quot;<br/>or independently euphonious.</p><p>The 9:7 is known in neo-Gothic theory as the _tertia automotiva_ or<br/>&quot;automotive third,&quot; both because of its especially dynamic and<br/>forward-going qualities, and because of its proverbial resemblance to<br/>an automobile horn -- the &quot;car horn third&quot; of popular speech, or more<br/>poetically the _tertia clarionis_ or &quot;clarion third.&quot;</p><p>More specifically, the 9:7 may have a strident quality in a split<br/>fifth sonority where it is placed below a 7:6 minor third, for example<br/>A3-C#^4-E4, 14:18:21 or 0-435-702 cents -- likewise known as the<br/>_quinta fissa automotiva_ or &quot;automotive split fifth.&quot; The traditional<br/>Pythagorean 64:81:96, despite its complex ratios, often suggests a<br/>quality better fitting the medieval ideal of an &quot;imperfect concord&quot; at<br/>once unstable but _relatively_ blending.</p><p>In contrast, the 9:7 seems to have a more mellow or suave effect when<br/>placed conversely above the 7:6, for example A^3-C3-E^4, 6:7:9 or<br/>0-267-702 cents, the _quinta fissa suavis_.[15]</p><p>An expansive cadential sixth sonority such as A3-C#^4-F#^4 at 7:9:12<br/>may have a quality somewhere between that of these two forms, but with<br/>a certain &quot;streamlined&quot; kinship to the milder 6:7:9.[16] At the same<br/>time, the directed tension of the outer major sixth with its<br/>&quot;striving&quot; toward expansion to the octave lends impetus to a superb<br/>cadential resolution (M6-8 + M3-5), with both two-voice resolutions<br/>involving superincisive melodic semitones of 28:27.</p><p>Our hybrid progression with its septimal comma shift may therefore be<br/>seen as an artful strategy for maximizing both vertical euphony and<br/>efficient cadential action by mixing elements from standard 3-flavor<br/>and 7-flavor versions of the same progression. Opening with the milder<br/>64:81:96 of the 3-flavor version, we move to the streamlined 7:9:12 of<br/>the 7-flavor version -- with the comma shift marking the colorful<br/>rather than seamless point of juxtaposition.</p><p>                              E4      F#4      G4<br/>                              C#4              D4<br/>standard 3-flavor version     A3               G3</p><p>                              E4      F#^4     G4<br/>                              C#4     C#^4     D4<br/>change-of-flavor version      A3               G3</p><p>                              E4      F#^4     G4<br/>                              C#^4             D4<br/>standard 7-flavor version     A3               G4</p><p>Of course, we might choose any of these three versions: the standard<br/>Pythagorean version with its active-but-not-too-strident unstable<br/>sonorities; the standard 7-flavor version with its characteristic<br/>opening 14:18:21, a sonority with a smooth as well as a strident side;<br/>or the mixed version with its calculated juxtaposition.[17]</p><p>Each choice has its own artistic attractions, reminding us that<br/>musical perception is a matter not only of acoustical complexity or<br/>harmonic entropy, but also of stylistic context or harmonic inertia,<br/>with the comma shift as one artful form of &quot;acceleration.&quot;[18]</p><p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>4.1.2. The &quot;commatic genus&quot; commatically varied<br/>-----------------------------------------------</p><p>In 1357, the theorist Johannes Boen[19] reports a taste for a new kind<br/>of &quot;commatic&quot; melody involving two successive diatonic semitones, a<br/>pattern distinct from that of the recognized diatonic, chromatic, or<br/>enharmonic genus, e.g.:</p><p>                        F4-E4-D#4</p><p>This kind of progression occurs in some early 15th-century music, for<br/>example that of Guillaume le Grant. In a usual Pythagorean 3-flavor,<br/>this style involves cadences such as the following:</p><p>                  Eb4  D4  C#4  D4<br/>                  Bb3  A3  G#3  A3<br/>                  G3   F3  E3   D3</p><p>Here we have a series of sixth sonorities leading to a usual expansive<br/>resolution of (M6-8 + M3-5). Both upper voices feature Boen&apos;s<br/>consecutive descending diatonic semitones: Eb4-D4-C#4, or Bb3-A3-G#3.<br/>These are the usual Pythagorean semitones at 256:243 (~90.22 cents).</p><p>To make this progression yet more distinctive, we can use the 7-flavor<br/>for the last sixth sonority leading to the stable trine:</p><p>                  Eb4  D4  C#^4  D4<br/>                  Bb3  A3  G#^3  A3<br/>                  G3   F3  E3    D3</p><p>This nuance results in a joining of two _unequal_ semitones, a 90-cent<br/>Pythagorean semitone followed by a supercompact 67-cent 28:27 semitone<br/>(Eb4-D4-C#^4, or Bb3-A3-G#^3) bringing us to the penultimate cadential<br/>sonority, in turn resolved by ascending 28:27 semitones in the upper<br/>voices.</p><p>Here the shift from the &quot;inertial frame&quot; of the 3-flavor to the<br/>7-flavor underscores the contrast between the closely juxtaposed flats<br/>and sharps, joined by the two consecutive descending semitones: the<br/>vertical and horizontal dimensions share in this added touch of drama.</p><p>As an alternative to either variety of &quot;special&quot; progression, of<br/>course, we could conclude in a more usual late medieval fashion with a<br/>remissive cadence featuring the descending semitone Eb3-D3 in the<br/>lowest voice, nicely fulfilling a scenario suggested by the opening<br/>flats and descending semitones in the upper voices:</p><p>                  Eb4  D4  C4   D4<br/>                  Bb3  A3  G3   A3<br/>                  G3   F3  Eb3  D3</p><p>As a variation on this more routine and very pleasant progression in<br/>the usual Pythagorean 3-flavor, we could conclude with a 7-flavor<br/>cadence, here starting out on the upper manual:</p><p>                  Eb^4  D^4  C^4  D^4<br/>                  Bb^3  A^3  G^3  A^3<br/>                  G^3   F^3  Eb3  D^3</p><p>In addition to the vertical nuance of the 7-flavor resolution, this<br/>version introduces a subtle melodic contrast between the upper parts<br/>with their standard Pythagorean steps and the lowest voice with its<br/>tetrachord of 9:8-8:7-28:27 in the manner of Archytas and Al-Farabi.</p><p>As these examples may suggest, such choices may present the musical<br/>equivalent of a kind of multidimensional chess, with many moves and<br/>lines of variation open.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>4.1.3. Vertical sequences and septimal comma pumps<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>To this point, we have focused on progressions using the septimal<br/>comma shift as a calculated &quot;special effect.&quot; Additionally, certain<br/>common vertical progressions may require such direct comma shifts as a<br/>simple matter of &quot;musical geometry&quot; if we seek consistently to observe<br/>two conditions:</p><p>           (1) Unstable vertical intervals should have the simplest<br/>               possible ratios; and</p><p>           (2) Melodic cadential semitones should be tuned at 28:27,<br/>               the supercompact 7-flavor size of ~62.96 cents.</p><p>In practice, the &quot;necessity&quot; for direct septimal comma shifts becomes<br/>a matter of artistic choice, since we can if desired modify either of<br/>these conditions, for example by sometimes resolving pure 7-based<br/>sonorities using variant sizes of melodic whole-tones and semitones<br/>(Section 4.2).</p><p>However, the comma shift often lends a very pleasant and distinctive<br/>air to these standard sequences, adding an element of drama and<br/>underscoring cadential action, so that if it were not &quot;necessary&quot; we<br/>might wish to invent it.</p><p>One such &quot;septimal comma pump&quot; sequence involves a descending series<br/>of major sixth sonorities expanding to complete trines, at points<br/>where a remissive resolution (descending semitonal motion) is followed<br/>by an intensive resolution (ascending semitonal motion). Here I show<br/>an example in duple meter, although various phrasings in duple or<br/>triple (or other) meters are possible, and invite exploration:</p><p>1    2   | 1     2   &amp;   | 1<br/>F4   G^4   A^4   G^4 F#^4  G4<br/>F4   D^4   E^4   D^4 C#^4  D4<br/>Bb3        A^3       A3    G3</p><p>For the first remissive resolution, we move from B3-D^4-G^4 (7:9:12)<br/>to the trine A^3-E^4-A^4, with the descending 28:27 cadential semitone<br/>Bb3-A^3 in the lowest voice. This is in keeping with the usual pattern<br/>that remissive resolutions in the 7-flavor arrive at a stable trine or<br/>fifth on the upper keyboard manual, with descending semitones moving<br/>from the lower to the upper manual (e.g. Bb3-A^3).</p><p>Now that this resolution has &quot;pumped us up&quot; onto the upper manual at<br/>A^3-E^4-A^4, we proceed to the next progression in our chain, the<br/>intensive resolution from A3-C#^4-F#^4 (7:9:12) to G3-D4-G4, here by<br/>way of a beautiful quintal-quartal sonority A^3-D^4-G^4 (9:12:16).</p><p>With or without this optional connecting sonority, our sequence from<br/>A^3-E^4-A^4 to A3-C#^4-F#^4 at a pure 7:9:12 inevitably involves the<br/>comma shift A^3-A3 in the lowest voice. On our 24-note keyboard, we do<br/>not have available the alternative solution of building a pure 7:9:12<br/>on the unchanged lowest tone A^3, calling for A^3-C#^^4-F#^^4, with<br/>the upper voices raised in level by another septimal comma.</p><p>Within our 24-note system, the &quot;geometric necessity&quot; and high artistic<br/>opportunity of the downward A^3-A3 shift makes it possible to obtain<br/>A3-C#^4-F#^4 at a pure 7:9:12, resolving in a standard intensive<br/>manner with ascending 28:27 semitones in the upper voices moving from<br/>the upper to the lower manual (C#^4-D4, F#^4-G4). At the same time, it<br/>provides what I consider a felicitous touch of color and emphasis.</p><p>With human voices or other nonfixed-pitch instruments hypothetically<br/>adhering to our classic 2-3-7 JI model using integer ratios only[20],<br/>such a &quot;comma pump&quot; sequence might result in &quot;comma drift&quot; rather than<br/>a comma shift, with the pitch level raised to permit successive major<br/>sixth sonorities at 7:9:12 and consistent 28:27 cadential semitones:</p><p>1    2   | 1     2   &amp;     | 1<br/>F4   G^4   A^4   G^4 F#^^4   G^4<br/>F4   D^4   E^4   D^4 C#^^4   D^4<br/>Bb3        A^3               G^3</p><p>The cumulative upward drift involved in such adjustments may be<br/>illustrated more dramatically if we continue the sequence further,<br/>with each remissive cadence (Bb3-A^3 and F^3-E^^3 in the lowest voice)<br/>&quot;pumping up&quot; the pitch level by a septimal comma:</p><p>1   2  | 1    2   &amp;    | 1   2   | 1    2   | 1     2      | 1<br/>F4  G^4  A^4  G^4 F#^^4  G^4 E^^4  F^4 D^^4   E^^4  C#^^^4   D^^4<br/>F4  D^4  E^4  D^4 C#^^4  D^4 B^^3  C^4 A^^3   B^^3  G#^^^3   A^^3<br/>Bb3      A^3             G^3       F^3        E^^3           D^^3</p><p>In a 24-note keyboard version, these comma drifts are balanced by<br/>downward comma shifts whenever a remissive cadence is followed by an<br/>intensive cadence (A^3-A3-G3 or E^3-E3-D3 in the lowest voice), thus<br/>keeping within the range of the gamut:</p><p>1   2  | 1    2   &amp;    | 1   2   | 1   2   | 1     2    | 1<br/>F4  G^4  A^4  G^4 F#^4   G4  E^4   F4  D^4   E^4   C#^4   D4<br/>F4  D^4  E^4  D^4 C#^4   D4  B^3   C4  A^3   B^3   G#^3   A3<br/>Bb3      A^3      A3     G3        F3        E^3   E3     D3</p><p>Another kind of septimal comma shift sequence involves a progression<br/>from a trine to a fifth by way of a contractive minor seventh sonority<br/>(remissive resolution), and then back to the original trine by way of<br/>an expansive sixth sonority (intensive resolution). Here I apply an<br/>iambic pattern of triple meter often favored in a medieval European<br/>setting, placing stable sonorities in stressed positions while giving<br/>some duration and emphasis to unstable sonorities also:</p><p>1    2   3  | 1   2    3 | 1<br/>G^4  F4       E^4 F#^4     G4<br/>D^4  Bb3      A^3 C#^4     D4<br/>G^3           A^3 A3       G3</p><p>Here the first contractive/remissive resolution is from G^3-Bb3-F4<br/>(12:14:21) to the fifth A^3-E^4 (m7-5 + m3-1), with descending 28:27<br/>semitones (Bb3-A^3, F4-E^4). As with our previous sequence, we must<br/>now follow with the comma shift A^3-A3 in the lowest voice in order to<br/>permit an expansive sixth sonority A3-C#^4-F#^4 at a pure 7:9:12<br/>resolving intensively to G3-D4-G4. Again, the shift can lend extra<br/>color to the cadence as well as facilitating the desired intonation.</p><p>A related sequence featuring simultaneous septimal comma shifts in the<br/>two lower voices is the following:</p><p>1    2   3  | 1   2    3 | 1<br/>G^4  F4       E^4 F#^4     G4<br/>D^4           E^4 E4       D4<br/>G^3           A^3 A3       G3</p><p>Here our contractive/remissive seventh sonority is G^3-D^4-F4 (4:6:7),<br/>resolving to A^3-E^4, and followed by the expansive/intensive sixth<br/>sonority A3-E3-F#^4 (14:21:24), resolving in turn to G3-D4-G4. In<br/>moving to the penultimate sixth sonority, both lower voices negotiate<br/>direct comma shifts (A^3-A3, E^4-E4).</p><p>The &quot;double comma shift&quot; lends what I find a very pleasant ambiance to<br/>the cadence, making the penultimate 14:21:24 sonority yet more<br/>colorful, and amplifying the overall pattern of the two lower voices<br/>moving together in fifths, and the upper voice in contrary motion.<br/>For the lower voices to descend together by a septimal comma at the<br/>same time as the upper voice ascends to the elevated F#^4 might be<br/>said to reinforce this contrast on a fine intonational level.</p><p>-----------------<br/>Notes to Part III<br/>-----------------</p><p>13.

The term _quinta fissa suavis_ is in tribute to the great<br/>mathematician and theorist Leonhard Euler, who in 1764 advocated the<br/>use of 7-based intervals including the 7:6 minor third. See Joe<br/>Monzo&apos;s translation with commentary of an article by Patrice<br/>Bailhache, <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/euler/euler-en.htm</a>.</p><p>16. In various theoretical approaches based on concepts of the 17th<br/>century and later, the 6:7:9 and 7:9:12 are inversions sharing the<br/>same pitch classes, e.g. F#^3-A3-C#^4 and A3-C#^4-F#^4.</p><p>17. A similar logic may inspire such late medieval idioms as the<br/>direct chromatic semitones advocated by Marchettus of Padua in his<br/>_Lucidarium_ of 1318, for example in the following progression here<br/>shown with two possible alternative versions:</p><p> C4 C#4 D4         C#4     D4        C4      D4<br/> F3 E3  D3         F3  E3  D3        F3  E3  D3<br/>(Marchettus)       (Variant 1)       (Variant 2)</p><p>The version of Marchettus, with its direct chromatic progression of<br/>C4-C#4 in the upper voice, makes it possible to open on the pure fifth<br/>F3-C4 _and_ to obtain a major sixth E3-C#4 before the octave D3-D4<br/>(standard 14th-century resolution of M6-8). At the same time, this<br/>special melodic interval has a striking quality in its own right<br/>evidently embraced by Marchettus as an artistic resource rather than a<br/>reluctant necessity. Possible alternatives include an augmented fifth<br/>F3-C#4 preceding the major sixth E3-C#4 (Variant 1, a not unlikely<br/>interpretation in some 14th-century pieces); or a minor sixth E3-C4<br/>before the resolving octave D3-D4 (Variant 2).</p><p>18. While &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; postulates an intrinsic degree of<br/>&quot;consonance/simplicity&quot; or &quot;dissonance/complexity&quot; for a given<br/>interval or sonority, &quot;harmonic inertia&quot; focuses on a listener&apos;s<br/>expectations within a given tuning system or style. In a style where<br/>the rather complex Pythagorean 81:64 represents the regular and<br/>accustomed major third, for example, a cadential 9:7 may represent a<br/>notable &quot;acceleration&quot; or _change_ in entropy level, albeit arguably a<br/>decrease in entropy, just as in Newtonian physics a deceleration is<br/>also an acceleration (i.e. a change of velocity).</p><p>19.

Boen&apos;s &quot;new genus&quot; _quod commaticum dici potest_<br/>(&quot;which may be called commatic&quot;) is illustrated by the descending<br/>tetrachord F4-E4-D#4-C4, a division of 256:243-256:243-19683:16384<br/>(two Pythagorean diatonic semitones followed by an augmented second at<br/>~317.60 cents), or a rounded 90-90-318 cents.</p><p>20. In practice, some kind of &quot;adaptive JI&quot; (Paul Erlich) involving<br/>very small pitch adjustments might obtain, as modelled in other<br/>musical contexts, for example, by Vicentino&apos;s adaptive tuning (see<br/>Section 3) and the variable adaptive tuning of John deLaubenfels.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
