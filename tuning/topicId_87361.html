As I understand it, this explains why we call notes that don&apos;t match with chords &quot;neighboring tones&quot; in common music theory and play them without much sustain and use &quot;accidentals&quot; (which often don&apos;t even match with the key, forget matching with any chords) for even shorter intervals.</p></div><h3><a id=87364 href="#87364">ðŸ”—</a>john777music &#x3C;jfos777@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2010 11:31:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks Michael,</p><p>if you haven&apos;t done so already please take a look at message number 87355 (Subject: From sine waves to complex tones). At this stage I&apos;m assuming that my formulas are correct for sine waves only and am using the same formulas as building blocks for more complex formulas that deal with complex tones (whose harmonics pretty much match the mathematical ideal). I also address two points you made earlier, one about a complex interval (e.g. 473/331) being close to a simple interval (e.g. 10/7), and the other about 47/19 being VERY close to 5/2.</p><p>John.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; John,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Odd...I think it would make a difference IF plucked means pulled enough to hit back against the fret board causing a fairly in-harmonic sound to be added as the two collide (IE for the first 30 milliseconds or so).
