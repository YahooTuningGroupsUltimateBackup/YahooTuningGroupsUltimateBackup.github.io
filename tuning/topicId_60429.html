I don&apos;t like Yahoo&apos;s site either, but it<br/>&gt; is at least a way to keep intellectual material with the list.</p><p>.... then in the following posts in that Tuning Digest, I find someone complaining about &quot;trouble at list file storage&quot; and the suggestion to post at private sites.</p><p>I seem to remember that the content of all url&apos;s are archived somewhere on the net, so that although the site itself or Yahoo lists may cease to function,<br/>the content is fairly easily &quot;findable&quot; in the archives of the net.<br/>Most of the links that I refer are formatted as columns, or contain graphics which would be less clear in a text format.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s all fine and well, but on a mailing list, it&apos;s considered<br/>&gt; rude if you just post links all the time.  Especially if they&apos;re<br/>&gt; always to one of your sites.  It&apos;s self-promotional</p><p>Of course it&apos;s &quot;self-promotional&quot;, we are living in an ego-centric, celebrity worshipping, capitalist society, of branding for the consumers.</p><p>So if you type &quot;lullabies&quot; into your iTunes store search, the top 14 of the 1250+ songs that are listed are all LucyTuned Lullabies (from around the world).</p><p>[We can all see that the corporations and governments are now attempting to dominate the net. - blah ^ n ] --- That&apos;s for another list;-)</p><p>It&apos;s about time we started making some decent money back from Lulls sales!</p><p>&gt; (not that<br/>&gt; anyone&apos;d accuse you of that) and doesn&apos;t contribute intellectual<br/>&gt; material to the list (which is in some sense an effort to aggregate<br/>&gt; shared intellectual material).<br/>&gt;</p><p>Since you ask I shall actually prepare a text explanation of scalecoding, and post it to the tuning list.</p><p>I still need to think it through as I also hope to be able to post my thoughts on how this type of system could also be extended and applied to produce<br/>a classification method for scale types other than meantone.</p><p>Don&apos;t hold your breathe though; it&apos;ll take me a few days to fully think it out, and post an initial and hopefully practical proposal.</p><p>Charles Lucy - <a href="mailto:lucy@harmonics.com">lucy@harmonics.com</a><br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy/download/CD from: <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a></p></div><h3><a id=60485 href="#60485">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/12/2005 10:11:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; So if you type &quot;lullabies&quot; into your iTunes store search,</p><p>Sorry, I refuse to use iTunes.</p><p>&gt; the top 14  of the 1250+ songs that are listed are all<br/>&gt; LucyTuned Lullabies (from  around the world).</p><p>Congrats!</p><p>&gt; Since you ask I shall actually prepare a text explanation of<br/>&gt; scalecoding, and post it to the tuning list.</p><p>Great!</p><p>&gt; I still need to think it through as I also hope to be able<br/>&gt; to post my  thoughts on how this type of system could also be<br/>&gt; extended and applied to produce a classification method for<br/>&gt; scale types other than meantone.</p><p>That would be very good, since the qusetion being asked in<br/>this thread was absolutely, from the beginning, meant to<br/>apply to all scale types.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
