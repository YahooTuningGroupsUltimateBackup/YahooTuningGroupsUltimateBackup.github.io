Iranian music is a big favorite of mine and what you say<br/>here I have heard others state. One mid east musician said he could tell<br/>a musician&apos;s origin within 20 miles by his intonation as well as well as<br/>the ornaments he uses.<br/>Do you have any connection to Khaladj by any chance (pardon if that is a<br/>bad question) ?</p><p>There are all type of different theories represented on this list which<br/>are not in agreement with each other .<br/>It seems there is already so much going on in Iranian music that it<br/>contains it own method into the future.</p><p>It seems that Darish Talai has done some interesting things with tunings<br/>also  but not sure how he rates in your book.</p><p>One paper that you might find interesting is the last page of<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/RAST.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/RAST.PDF</a><br/>as it shows one possible 24 tone scale that does not use 1/4 tones</p><p>this has some interesting 22 tone scales as variations off the the 22<br/>tone system of india which as you probably know is indebted greatly to<br/>the persian music of the 13-14th century. just skip over the zig zag<br/>charts for the moment and the graphs of actual rations should give an<br/>idea of some possibilities.<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/trans22.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/trans22.PDF</a></p><p>a reference to all types of papers can be found at<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson2.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson2.html</a></p><p> one of these is an interesting document which is persian in origin<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/djamidarreg.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/djamidarreg.PDF</a><br/>But as you can see , we only have a translation of it from a russian<br/>translation.<br/> If you have any access to the original and can translated . this would<br/>be amazingly useful.<br/>It is the most read document on my site by far<br/>( i am sure this might be a surprise to those on this list)</p><p>An then there are other theoretical works</p><p> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/wilson.html</a><br/> but i would start with<br/>letter to Chalmers pertaining to MOMENTS OF SYMMETRY/TANABE CYCLE</p><p>Mohajeri Shahin wrote:</p><p>&gt;                                                                    Hi<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                                    I have a question:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  As you know in Iranian scales &quot;quarter tone&quot; is used &iuml;&iquest;&half;.. but it&apos;s not<br/>&gt;                                               the 24-ET 1/4 tone &iuml;&iquest;&half;..<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        It is different from one player to another due to style and his<br/>&gt;    choice. So you can see different intervals in one modalscale ( like<br/>&gt;                                   SEGAH) between different musicians.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     I want to know that what is the intervallic  range (in cent) to be<br/>&gt;                                                    called &quot;1/4 tone&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;        2- I want to introduce the new topics about tuning and scale to<br/>&gt;    Iranian musicians by translating them &iuml;&iquest;&half;.
