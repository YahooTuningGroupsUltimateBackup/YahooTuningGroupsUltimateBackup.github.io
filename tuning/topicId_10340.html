Really, it&apos;s not hard.</p><p>Hey Johnny!</p><p>I&apos;m getting your drift.  However, could you ASSURE me that average<br/>woodwind performers could play notation... let us say 19-tone notation<br/>derived from 31 tone just intonation if one were to indicate CENTS<br/>values plus or minus above the notes??</p><p>And, if so, how do they do this??  With fingerings, or by bending, or<br/>both?  Please illuminate, if you have time... my ignorance is abounding.</p><p>Joe<br/>_____________ _____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
