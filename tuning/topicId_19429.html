Seeing a common communication<br/>medium misused, misunderstood, or lazily applied can be a waste of<br/>other&apos;s time.</p><p>&gt; some people... more the &quot;math heads&quot; on this list who write great<br/>&gt; math abstractions and can hardly spell or write a thing.  So<br/>&gt; what.</p><p>So what?? If they can&apos;t take the time to write carefully and clearly,<br/>why should I take the time to try and figure out what their thoughts<br/>are? There are a myriad of ways to post on this, or any list. Casual<br/>thoughts are welcome, as are more intense and worked-out posts. If<br/>someone is trying to make a detailed point, or present compelling<br/>evidence, I *expect* that they will use care and craft in posting<br/>their message. If they don&apos;t, it must not be very important.</p><p>&gt; Everybody has a different approach, and INSISTING that somebody do<br/>&gt; this or that format or write with capitalized sentences just turns<br/>&gt; people off... both the &quot;old timers&quot; and, possibly, people who are<br/>&gt; just &quot;lurking&quot; and not posting.</p><p>There is room for individualism, but there is also a general<br/>consensus on how to post to a mailing list. With such a constrained<br/>medium, and with only ascii text to represent your thoughts, *how*<br/>you do that is very important. Historically speaking, all caps are<br/>used in the most IMPORTANT and ASSERTIVE circumstances. If they are<br/>used constantly, their value is lessened, just as someone who<br/>constantly shouts is quickly ignored.</p><p>As for turning people off, I&apos;ll just say that a number of people have<br/>written me off-list, some as they leave, about the chattiness, sloppy<br/>posting habits, and the sometimes low signal-to-noise ratio. While I<br/>value much of what is said here, in contrast to the four other<br/>mailing lists I belong to, I have to agree.</p><p>&gt; It may even cause people to leave this list... although I would not<br/>&gt; like to predict that this will be the case... :)</p><p>Many things will cause people to leave, many to cause joining. A list<br/>that presents itself in clear and effective communication is one<br/>*I&apos;d* enjoy reading.</p><p>&gt; Watch.  I am even going to write a sentence without a capital<br/>letter<br/>&gt; and with a mistake!  Whoooo, whooo, whooo.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hi ther<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; See, I did it...</p><p>I&apos;m sure this was done in fun, and to make a point. If there was<br/>someone just new to the list, what do you think they would make of<br/>it? Assuming every post one makes to the list is read, what kind of<br/>impression do you want to leave?</p><p>Regards,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=19462 href="#19462">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>2/26/2001 5:55:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;shreeswifty&quot; &lt;ppagano@b...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_19429.html#19435">/tuning/topicId_19429.html#19435</a></p><p>&gt; kuhle jo<br/>&gt; glad your&apos;re not fuct<br/>&gt; true dat<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks, Swifty, and I&apos;m happy to see that you agree with my use of<br/>language and a little &quot;fun&quot; from time to time on the list!<br/>________ ____ _____ ____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
