I have my own understanding of Maqam Music which I try to fortify with my previous knowledge on Western Music. I point out certain mistakes that I believe not only are crucial, but also detrimental to the education of virtuosos. Yes, you can try to play Maqam Music in 24-tET, you can try to play it in Yekta-Arel-Ezgi, you can try to play it in any tuning you want, it&apos;s just that what I hear and observe is not represented entirely or correctly with these tunings. I do not claim to be an expert in Maqam Music, much less an authority. I am merely an investigator, an enthusiast. I propound a methodology at my own risk. Why does it bother you? And why does it not bother you that so many diverse schools have arisen just these past two centuries in order to be able to explain this genre, all at variance with each other? And more importantly, why cannot they explain it to OUR (and I am not alone in this) satisfaction?</p><p>Flippant tunings! Right. You go play with your good ol&apos; 12-Equal. At least some people who won&apos;t notice the difference between 5/4 and 400 cents loooove to hear THAT.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Kraig Grady<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: 04 Ekim 2005 Sal&imath; 22:04<br/>  Subject: [tuning] Re: Digest Number 3697</p><p>  It is apparent that every recording of turkish music i have listen to is not in some flippant tuning derived from this list.<br/>  just what instruments have you built to play this temperment andhow much time have you spent with it.<br/>  have you managed to get one ensemble to play through the repertoire. what has each of the viruosos you took statistical measurements say of these scales?</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2005 3:31:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; It is apparent that every recording of turkish music i have<br/>&gt; listen to is not in some flippant tuning derived from this list.</p><p>They do not seem to more closely resemble the speculations on<br/>the Wilson archive.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
