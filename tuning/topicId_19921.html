Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>3/7/2001 10:56:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone.</p><p>To Dan Wolf:</p><p>Please let me strongly urge you _not_ to deprive FAQ readers of the<br/>benefits of your discussion of the &quot;Why 12&quot; question, including the<br/>scholarship of Diether de la Motte, someone whose historical viewpoint and<br/>engaging style I deeply respect and enjoy; you do a great service to this<br/>List and the FAQ readership by making his writings so conveniently<br/>accessible and better known to a trans-Atlantic audience. It&apos;s an honor to<br/>have my views included _along_ with such material, each statement having<br/>its own viewpoint and perspective.</p><p>How &quot;Why 12?&quot; might be answered from the perspective of the age of<br/>Josquin around 1500 is an approach bringing into play lots of ideas:<br/>octave-species, counterpoint, cadences and accidentals from the<br/>perspective of that era, and so forth. As Thomas Morley said, there<br/>are &quot;more roads to the wood than one.&quot;</p><p>This FAQ needs a plurality of voices, and the &quot;Why 12?&quot; question is<br/>maybe a bit like one of those madrigal texts or cantus firmus theme<br/>for a Mass which musicians take delight in setting and then comparing<br/>their settings, sometimes in the process creating anthologies which<br/>have come down to us. Neither Ockeghem&apos;s _Petite camusette_ nor<br/>Josquin&apos;s is a substitute for the other; and this FAQ question also<br/>invites &quot;settings&quot; in different styles.</p><p>The topics you (and de la Motte) present are vital background for various<br/>parts of the FAQ: Renaissance meantone, the 16th-century syntonic diatonic<br/>JI systems, vocal intonations, modes, and so forth.</p><p>Of course, we could both take a look at our drafts to coordinate them,<br/>but overlap might not be bad either: some things can be quite useful<br/>to have said more than once, especially with alternative explanations<br/>from different viewpoints (maybe some readers will follow one most<br/>easily, other readers another). I certainly need to &quot;debug&quot; some items<br/>and revise my draft anyway.</p><p>For example, there&apos;s what a programmer might consider analogous to a<br/>&quot;fencepost-counting problem&quot;: I say that &quot;Eb-C#&quot; is a &quot;ten-note&quot; chain<br/>when its a ten-fifth (but 11 note!) chain.</p><p>Joseph Pehrson: Thank you for your encouragement, and I&apos;d emphasize<br/>how indebted we all are to Ervin Wilson for his MOS concept. If the<br/>&quot;Why 12?&quot; question is an opportunity to introduce it and get the<br/>reader curious, so much the better.</p><p>Your questions are invaluable, and I hope that I addressed the<br/>accidental question a bit. Daniel Wolf maybe gave my own sense of this<br/>pretty well: the extra notes are just &quot;there,&quot; and I use them when it<br/>seems right (or when the original version or an editor&apos;s suggestion<br/>that I agree with indicates). Repeating the same passage with<br/>different accidentals is something that happens in some tablatures,<br/>and it can add pleasing variety at times.</p><p>People have said that the kind of performer&apos;s discretion in this music<br/>is maybe like that in jazz: accidentals are a kind of dialogue between<br/>composer and performer, with lots of room for taste and choice. Robert<br/>Toft&apos;s book is one of the best and most detailed studies of this -- it<br/>has lots of theory, and lots of practice.</p><p>Dan Stearns: First, thanks for your gracious words on the &quot;What is<br/>microtonality?&quot; FAQ, which I was reflecting on today while testing out<br/>some curious theoretical concepts about regular tunings. Your posts<br/>and viewpoints -- not mention your scale-construction techniques and<br/>concepts which can be highly contagious -- have added immensely to my<br/>own views on this question, but something in your voice might much<br/>enrich the FAQ.</p><p>As far as &quot;out-of-tune,&quot; I&apos;d say that there&apos;s no such thing as an<br/>interval out of tune, only the right interval sounded at the wrong<br/>time.</p><p>Similarly, a &quot;tuning error&quot; is a tuning variation in an other than<br/>desired context.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
