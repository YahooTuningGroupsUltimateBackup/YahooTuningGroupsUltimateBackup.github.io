Re: bicycle music<br/>&gt;           From: &quot;Daniel Wolf&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:djwolf@snafu.de">djwolf@snafu.de</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;Just to make this thread more complete, it should be notes that Richard<br/>&gt;Lerman&apos;s &quot;travelon gamelan&quot; made use of bicycles and parts thereof in an<br/>&gt;alternatively tuned environment; at least one work of P.D.Q. Bach (Peter<br/>&gt;Schickele) featured a prominent role for bicycle (especially blown<br/>&gt;handlebars); and Gordon Mumma&apos;s interview in his episode of Robert Ashley&apos;s<br/>&gt;&quot;video opera&quot; _Music with Roots in the Aether_ contains a bit of theoretical<br/>&gt;discourse on the subject of the bicycle as folk instrument.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Daniel Wolf</p><p>You might like to add to that list &quot;A concert on bicycles&quot; a program I<br/>first did in Canberra (Australia&apos;s national capital) in 1983. The program<br/>involved an audience attending an outdoor concert riding bicycles around<br/>the foreshore of Lake Burley Griffin with ghetto-blaster radio receivers<br/>strapped to the bicycle frame, and riding en masse with the radios tuned to<br/>a pre-taped program consisting of electro-acoustic music. And though the<br/>sound was broadcast in mono, variations in phase and pitch caused by<br/>doppler shifts and the other bi-products of the moving participants at<br/>times produced some surprising microtonal chorusing and pseudo-stereo<br/>effects. And in the warm part of the day in early spring, the concert<br/>experience sure beat sitting in a concert hall gawking at loudpeakers. The<br/>event was more like a picnic than a concert and more fun than most. If a<br/>bicycle is a folk instrument then so too is a ghetto blaster. If anyone&apos;s<br/>interested this event was documented in LMJ No 4. pp. 17-22. The article<br/>was titled &quot;Interactive Radio&quot;.</p><p>Greg S</p></div>
