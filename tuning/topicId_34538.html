We have 81/80 = (9/8)/(10/9), a ratio of two &quot;jacks&quot;--one with a square numerator, the other with a triangular numerator in this case. Similarly, 2401/2400 =<br/>(49/48)/(50/49) and 194481/194480 = (441/440)/(442/441), so we might expect these to be comparitively important also. For that matter, we can look at numerators which are squares of triangular numbers, among which we find 225/224 = (15/14)/(16/15), 3025/3024 = (55/54)/(56/55),<br/>and 123201/123200 = (351/350)/(352/351), all of which may lay claim to being commas of interest. The square and triangular part is really of little significance by itself, and 9801/9800 = (99/98)/(100/99) is also a jumping jack, for instance. Since all of this bears on high-octane temperaments, equal or otherwise, it is probably of little practical importance, I&apos;m afraid.</p></div><h3><a id=34548 href="#34548">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>2/20/2002 4:38:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:007401c1b9ec$93c27660$af48620c@dsl.att.net">007401c1b9ec$93c27660$af48620c@dsl.att.net</a>&gt;<br/>monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; paul, i&apos;m at  l e a s t   as mystified as you with Gene&apos;s<br/>&gt; initial explanations, but i can at least offer this ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2401/2400 is prime-factored into [2 3 5 7]^[-5 -1 -2  4] .</p><p>You&apos;re writing what looks like a wedge product, but isn&apos;t.
