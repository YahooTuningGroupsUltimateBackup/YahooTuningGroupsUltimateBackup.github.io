Hear how the noise moves left and right?<br/>That&apos;s called ITD - Interaural Time Difference,<br/>one of the components of 3D positional audio.<br/>It sounds smoothest if you have an effects<br/>box that interpolates position when modulating<br/>the delay time.</p><p>Just so everyone is on the same page, you don&apos;t need<br/>feedback/regeneration to hear this effect - though adding<br/>it increases the Q (resonance) of this digital<br/>filter.</p><p>The previous posts are correct in that perception of<br/>the tone comes from not just the 50Hz signal but<br/>also its overtones (so the fundamental may not even be<br/>needed - as in the mentioned case of band-limited noise).<br/>And I do believe, upon reflection<br/>that those partials are simply the peaks in mounds<br/>that are centered about each expected integer harmonic -<br/>the response curve of a comb filter.</p><p>When playing with the noise and its delayed signal<br/>mixed together, try sweeping the delay time - you&apos;ll<br/>hear the infamous WHOOSH of a comb filter being<br/>swept over noise - it sounds just like an airplane<br/>going by (which I was alluding to in the last post.</p><p>delay line length    base pitch<br/>     20ms              50Hz<br/>      1ms            1000Hz<br/>     .2ms            5000Hz</p><p>These experiments are experiments in physical modelling -<br/>noise is like air across an edge and a delay line is<br/>like a whipple tube - that&apos;s why it sounds like a whipple<br/>tube (tube spun around your head to make an airy whistling<br/>tone).</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
