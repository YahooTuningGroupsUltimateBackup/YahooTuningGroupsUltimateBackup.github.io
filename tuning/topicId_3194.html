My only complaint is that<br/>the piece didn&apos;t last for an hour or so. Yep!</p><p>Michiyo Suziki performed Joji Yausa&apos;s Solitude - everything<br/>this clarinetist performs turns to gold. Amazing.</p><p>John Cage&apos;s Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano<br/>was performed by Joshua Pierce. After all the recordings I&apos;ve heard<br/>on large grand pianos, this sounded a bit different. But Pierce&apos;s<br/>performance on the halls resident piano still impressed me,<br/>the preparations still resonated true.</p><p>Violetta Dinescu&apos;s Intarsien performed by Thomas Rutishauser on cello<br/>with wild glissando and percussive tapping on the instrument.<br/>Why isn&apos;t this composer&apos;s work more widely performed??? Shouldn&apos;t there<br/>be a festival devoted to Dinescu&apos;s work?</p><p>Sasha Bagdanowitch performed his An Ocean Walks Behind a Lake.<br/>Wearing a headphone/microphone/wireless combination, he sang<br/>and danced along with his pre-recorded singing Sashas on<br/>pre-recorded tape for about 20 min. Oh, those pure intervals<br/>sung by voices! An original vision influenced by the east,<br/>Sasha deserves wider exposure.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard rolled out a version of his solo Zanzibar,<br/>now for two bassoons. Yung-Ling Chang accompanied JR in<br/>assembling the instruments while using extended techniques<br/>to give life to the piece. NYC&apos;s downtown music crowd don&apos;t<br/>know what they&apos;re missing - the multiphonics, the extended<br/>techniques!</p><p>Meredith Borden of NYC&apos;s hardest working microtonal band<br/>Birdhouse, performed her Icarus Dreams for voice and<br/>autoharp in just intonation. As always, amazing range and<br/>a sensitivity to pitch made this piece work beyond any expectations.<br/>Knocked me out - she used some techniques that I don&apos;t<br/>think I&apos;ve heard her use before. Amen!</p><p>Four keyboards and three percussionists gave life to<br/>composer Patrick Grant&apos;s Everything Distinct:<br/>Everything the Same. Keyboards tuned to a gamalan tuning,<br/>in fact the piece seems to be influenced by the<br/>gamelan of Bali - I was blown away. It&apos;s so exciting to hear<br/>this music live.</p><p>Eric Ross and David Simmons, theremin<br/>Vito Ricci, wrench guitar<br/>Johnny Reinhard, bassoon performed an improvisation, Spring,<br/>where each performer represented a season. I had trouble separating<br/>the seasons but no trouble enjoying the collected improvisations<br/>of this seasoned quartet.</p><p>And those are only the highlights, I couldn&apos;t hear everything,<br/>couldn&apos;t sit all the time, had to get up, stretch and get fresh<br/>air.</p><p>Much credit goes to Johnny Reinhard - for making it all happen,<br/>Ted Coons, President AFMM and Professor of Psychology at NYU<br/>for getting us the hall,<br/>Patrick Grant for provding a sound system and expert sound check advice.</p><p>And I really enjoyed performing my piece Sonic Bloom at the festival.<br/>A privilege.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* J u x t a p o s i t i o n     E z i n e<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
