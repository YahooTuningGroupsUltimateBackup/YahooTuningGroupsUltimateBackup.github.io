We rehearsed regularly, and did a number of gigs together. I learned a number of traditional Japanese tunes, and we also worked on a few pieces of mine in 19 and 34. What&apos;s interesting is that with the first lady, Junko, we rarely chatted about tunings; she didn&apos;t seem to know much about the subject. I did notice that her 3rd was quite sharp to my 12 tone 3rd, but overall my guitar and the koto sounded pretty good together. Since her 3rd was sharp, I&apos;m thinking that she was tuning by 5ths, but don&apos;t know for sure. But, since 5ths based tuning and 12 eq are so similar, it makes sense. But, with both ladies I didn&apos;t feel like a musicologist as much as just a musician trying to play some music with someone, so I never really quizzed them on tuning theory.</p><p>   The other woman, Yoko, was familiar with tunings to some degree, and once remarked that she would sometimes tune her 1/2 step to 85 cents; don&apos;t know why, but our instruments also blended well. She tuned her koto to 34 to play my tune &quot;34 Steps,&quot; and it sounded killer. What was also interesting to me was that some of the Japanese tunes had quite a few notes in the structure; it was definitely not just a pentatonic scale, one had 10 notes out of 12. Learning the music of any culture can be a long process, and I really enjoyed the experience, and it made an impression on my own phrasing. Junko once remarked to me, &quot;You understand my music very well.&quot; Just listening, and trying to match the phrasing, goes a long way, and I really enjoyed the experience...best...Hstick<br/><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p></div>
