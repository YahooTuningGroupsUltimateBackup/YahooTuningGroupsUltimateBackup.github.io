And that all traditional<br/>musics have evolved from those &quot;imperfect&quot; instruments, which<br/>probably accounts for most of their differences and some of their<br/>similarities?</p><p>Let me grasp the opportunity to tell you a story.</p><p>&lt;small print/&gt; I have no proof of anything I will mention in a<br/>moment; it&apos;s all just an idea I have (and looking for clues for or<br/>against it is at least part of the reason why I try to follow these<br/>here lists). I do not really expect to be refuted, and my opinions<br/>will go down very well with e.g. Joe Monzo, but you&apos;re welcome to<br/>surprise me. (Read: what do you think I post this for?) &lt;/on with<br/>the show&gt;</p><p>A long, long time ago, just after Man started to build wooden<br/>dwellings and banging on a log for fun had become an established<br/>practice, man discovered that banging on a second log increased the<br/>fun: it was now possible to follow different strains of bangs that<br/>could be differentiated by their timbre which was at the same time<br/>relative pitch. It also turned banging on something into a positive<br/>communal activity and furthered the arts of science and<br/>communication when people tried to agree on who bangs when. The<br/>increasing of additional fun relative to the number of participants<br/>was hence called, in the primitive spelling of the day,<br/>&quot;logarhythm&quot;.</p><p>Inspired by this, Woman began to pluck the strings on her loom. As a<br/>matter of establishing tradition and culture, certain plucking and<br/>weaving patterns were preserved, and soon it was deemed desirable to<br/>reproduce the pitch patterns as exactly as the woven designs.<br/>Different strings were tuned to the pitch of an exact fraction of<br/>another string (a third proved convenient enough for the desired<br/>results), an thus exactly repeatable melodies were invented.</p><p>But all the while there were backward people loath of the newfangled<br/>logarhythms and looming maths. They had the hunting bow and arrow as<br/>&quot;all the civilization WE need&quot; and were content to BANG on a STRING,<br/>which the more cultured peoples considered inappropriate.</p><p>I should come up with something else about equidistant holes in a<br/>reed, but I can&apos;t think of anything. I think, though, that something<br/>about artificialness should be mentioned there.</p><p>And it all amount to this:</p><p>I believe that music arises from the instruments used.</p><p>The voice is totally free, without much to assist orientation in the<br/>pitch continuum.</p><p>Some &quot;found&quot; instruments produce different pitches that are not<br/>reproducable in similar instruments, and you use what you get: the<br/>overblown tone on a didgeridoo for instance (or a shofar).</p><p>Some instruments are made, but their pitch depends on too many<br/>variables to be predictable. In an ensemble of them, you just try<br/>not to allow single pitches to get too close to each other, or, not<br/>to have any intervals that stick out. That&apos;s one respectable tuning<br/>aesthetic, the equidistant, and it applies especially to collections<br/>of idiophones.</p><p>Collections of plucked strings are easier to tune, they behave<br/>pretty predictably. You can get a definite pitch by dividing one of<br/>the strings and tuning another one to it: Pythagorean tuning,<br/>suitable for harps and such.</p><p>You can take a reed, a bone, or a string and shorten it with holes<br/>or your fingers: the subharmonic series.</p><p>You can filter the sound of the voice or anything else which<br/>vibrates in the audio range by varying a resonating cavity (throat<br/>singing, jaw&apos;s harps) or by obstructing certain lower partials<br/>(berimbaos, [mariners&apos;] trumpets): the harmonic series. Take note<br/>here that &quot;common practice&quot; evolved just north of the Alps, where<br/>&#x9;@ the vikings and such played lures, basically brass imitations of<br/>mammoth tusks tuned a fourth (or fifth?) apart<br/>&#x9;@ there is a living tradition of alphorn and, most pertinently,<br/>jaw&apos;s harp music where virtuosos play on several instruments at a<br/>time.<br/>This is very conducive to lower partial harmony, or, this is where<br/>lower partial harmony belongs.</p><p>Have I mentioned everything?</p><p>Now there might be a problem where different instruments play<br/>together, and this is where systems come in. Not that they need to<br/>(flute, voice, and gongs in Balinesian music; all kinds of<br/>instruments [none of them actually too hard to tune differently] in<br/>Noh and probably Gagaku music). But you might as well reduce all the<br/>possiblities to one system that is easy to try out and compute<br/>(Pythagorean) or that is convenient for modulation (12-tET), or that<br/>is closed (ETs), or... . Or you could posit a super-system that<br/>unites different tunings (which is what I think the sruti system was<br/>originally: a common home to three gramas that were based on pitches<br/>produced by different types of instruments, or a method teaching how<br/>to imitate them on an instruments not necessarily limited to one<br/>tuning [which would have to be of the stopped string type]).</p><p>Well, thanks for listening.</p><p>klaus</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/25/2001 1:20:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Klaus,</p><p>I think one of the important points you&apos;re missing in your<br/>ruminations is the psychological similarity of pitches at 2:1, and<br/>the lesser but still significant similarity obtained at 3:2 and 4:3.<br/>This sense of similarity may be inborn or it may be acquired<br/>prenatally due to exposure to the harmonics in the mother&apos;s voice.
