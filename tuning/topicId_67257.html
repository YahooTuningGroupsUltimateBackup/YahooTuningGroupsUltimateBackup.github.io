What leads you that conclusion?</p><p>&gt; ... How they apply to particular circumstances is a complex<br/>question that we may not always be able to answer.</p><p>Rarely will be able, IMO.</p><p>&gt; In the case of  #9 chord, I can cite the 19th harmonic, also<br/>discuss leading tone and voice leading issues, and then still leave<br/>the question open as to what is really being perceived.  Clearly<br/>there are *some* universal or near universal factors that favor the<br/>existence of the chord.</p><p>Again, query universality.</p><p>&gt; On the other hand, the augmented chord seems to me to be clearly<br/>the result of two factors: voice leading, and dumb theorists<br/>saying &quot;oh, if we have a major third and a minor third in a major<br/>chord, what if we just have two major thirds?&quot;</p><p>And the second seems to me quite likely; even likelier, is dumb NON-<br/>theorists just playing around on the keyboard or fretboard and<br/>coming up with new chords that &quot;work&quot; in progressions.</p><p>&gt; In context, any sound or combination of sound can have meaning in<br/>how it relates to the music around it.  My question is whether some<br/>chords or progressions (or rhythms for that matter) have prominance<br/>due to factors beyond convention.</p><p>Your assumption of universals surely is an assumption that they do?</p><p>&gt; My feeling about many jazz chords is that they came to be simply<br/>by musicians arbitrarily adding every other note, or doing other<br/>such experimental randomness and then finding a musical use for it...</p><p>Yep. that&apos;s more or less what I said above.  I&apos;ve often found some<br/>of the sounds I use by simple experiment, turning off the theorising<br/>brain and opening the ear.  You know, just sitting in front of the<br/>keyboard, or picking up a guitar or flute, _closing the eyes_ and<br/>flinging the fingers around with wild abandon!  When you hear<br/>something you like, do it again.  If you still like it, take a peek<br/>and find out *what* you were doing, so you can do it again later.</p><p>&gt; ...  ridiculous BS ... the more ridiculous jazz chords ... many<br/>chords only exist by intellectual games of amateur theorists trying<br/>things.</p><p>I don&apos;t know that the pejorative tone is useful in a serious<br/>discussion of musical origins.  Many people have, over the<br/>millennia, done things just because they liked the sound of them;<br/>others have done them based on wacky and since-discredited<br/>theories.  Does that make them any less valuable as musical impulses?</p><p>&gt; I wonder if others agree or if I&apos;m kidding myself.  And my feeling<br/>is that if it really could be an identifiable relationship to<br/>musicians who play by ear and know nothing of theory who did NOT<br/>learn it by convention (again I don&apos;t know if this could be) then it<br/>must be because there is *some* universal factor justifying it.</p><p>Aaron, the only &quot;universals&quot; I can come up with for you are that<br/>(a) people have always expressed themselves in music and<br/>(b) people like to play.</p><p>There is also some evidence that play is a useful learning strategy<br/>for many animals, humans included.</p><p>As a consequence of such play, I for one rediscovered many chords<br/>for myself (including major, minor, diminished and augmented and<br/>others I still don&apos;t know the &quot;proper&quot; names for) at a fairly young<br/>age, and in a total theoretical vacuum.</p><p>&gt; P.S. I know I&apos;m a little hipocritical trying to come up with<br/>explanations for everything while bashing people who&apos;s simplistic<br/>thinking got us &quot;13th&quot; chords in ET.  Well, unless I&apos;m sure an<br/>explanation really makes sense, I won&apos;t go around tauting it, so at<br/>least I can temper myself...</p><p>&quot;The Well-Tempered Wolf&quot;! ;-)</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@tonalsoft.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2006 9:32:28 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Yahya,</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;yahya_melb&quot; &lt;yahya@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but me being a very visual person, i made an Excel spreadsheet<br/>&gt; &gt; which plots rational approximations of EDO chords on a graph:<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning_files2/files/monz/graphic-harmonic-analyzer.xls">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning_files2/files/monz/graphic-harmonic-analyzer.xls</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What the sheet does is to calculate a column of values for<br/>&gt; each input number of degrees (eg 9 above), then plot the<br/>&gt; results on a graph.
