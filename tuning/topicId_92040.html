I was using the definition at<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_temperament">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntonic_temperament</a> - perhaps it&apos;s<br/>wrong? I haven&apos;t done much reading on this subject or know what the<br/>precise terminology is supposed to be.</p><p>The article is inconsistent in whether 5 has to be mapped to 4<br/>generators or not, even in cases where the major thirds are clearly<br/>wide enough to be in 9/7 territory. It first says so by saying that<br/>81/80 has to vanish up top, but then also says that Pythagorean tuning<br/>is a type of syntonic temperament, and allows wide fifths all the way<br/>up to 5-equal. It also defines syntonic temperament, at the top of the<br/>page, as sort of just an umbrella term for any rank-2 system where a<br/>&quot;tempered fifth&quot; is the generator. This incorporates narrow fifths,<br/>wide fifths, etc.</p><p>It then tries to play the super-wide fifths off as being just a type<br/>of a meantone for inharmonic timbres, but I had always assumed the<br/>&quot;correct&quot; definition was the definition here:</p><p>&quot;The syntonic temperament[1] is a system of musical tuning in which<br/>the frequency ratio of each musical interval is a product of powers of<br/>an octave and a tempered perfect fifth, with the width of the tempered<br/>major third being equal to four tempered perfect fifths minus two<br/>octaves and the width of the tempered major second being equal to two<br/>tempered perfect fifths minus one octave (i.e., half the width of the<br/>major third).&quot;</p><p>Hence for some generators a &quot;major third&quot; (as in the larger third in<br/>LLsLLLs) could be 9/7, for some it could be 5/4, for some it could be<br/>16/13, etc. But when you pass 5-tet, this isn&apos;t the case anymore as<br/>you start to get into father temperament, and when you pass 7-tet it<br/>isn&apos;t the case either as you start to get into mavila. I suppose by<br/>that definition the syntonic temperament would be any linear<br/>temperament that produces 5+2 scales.</p><p>Then again there&apos;s also this:<br/><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/MOSNamingScheme">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/MOSNamingScheme</a></p><p>So if the syntonic temperament is the name for the other thing<br/>(meantone temperaments for inharmonic timbres), then perhaps a good<br/>way to name these &quot;temperament classes&quot; (if they can be rigorously<br/>defined to begin with, that is) would just be to use Graham&apos;s names<br/>there. So this would then be the diatonic temperament class, or<br/>something like that. That is, unless this has already been mapped out,<br/>and I&apos;m reinventing the wheel here. If it has, I haven&apos;t heard much<br/>discussion about it.</p><p>&gt; However, consistency is a bigger issue from a &quot;definition of temperament&quot; perspective. I.e. in the range of 720 to about 685 cents, there are a lot of generators which don&apos;t produce their best approximation to 5/4 at four iterations. But there are also a lot that do...trouble is, the ones that do are sprinkled sporadically among ones that don&apos;t. So you can&apos;t give a continuous range of generators for a temperament if you want to care about consistency at all.</p><p>I agree, hence the problems with just defining the syntonic<br/>temperament as an inconsistent meantone. If it&apos;s supposed to be a<br/>generalization of meantone for inharmonic timbres, then the above<br/>doesn&apos;t end up being a problem. Or if it&apos;s supposed to be a<br/>generalization of meantone for LLsLLLs scales, then it also doesn&apos;t<br/>end up being a problem.

Do any other meantones have a 10-note MOS that looks like the standard pentachordal major?  They actually don&apos;t.  You&apos;ll get three step-sizes in any other meantone.  The fact that both sharps and flats are mixed in should make that obvious.  So treating the S.P.M. scale as a subset of meantone makes about as much sense as treating the diatonic scale as a subset of Blackwood-10 (i.e. try playing the major scale in 20-EDO).</p><p>&gt; So I&apos;m curious to see what other temperaments might support the scale<br/>&gt; I posted, find some other low-numbered ET that gives it interesting<br/>&gt; 7-limit tendencies or whatever, and find it.</p><p>If you want it strictly proper, diminished is the only way to go.

Really, just about any temperament which generates a 12-note MOS can be considered to be compatible with 12-tET, I think?  And if you follow Cameron&apos;s advice and formulate a JI version of the 12-tET scale, rather than looking at it from an altered-MOS perspective, you can find even more possibilities in other temperaments, since you&apos;d be eschewing the temperamental biases of 12-tET.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=92149 href="#92149">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/29/2010 11:45:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Mon, Aug 30, 2010 at 1:15 AM, Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; One good candidate I just discovered is augene temperament, which<br/>&gt; tempers out 128/125 and 126/125, and hence 39-tet supports this scale<br/>&gt; in interesting ways.

So is<br/>28-tet. So the interesting situation comes up where this scale is<br/>supported by 12 (a dimipent/meantone temperament) and 16 (a<br/>dimipent/mavila temperament), and the flavor of it doesn&apos;t ever<br/>change.

Perhaps<br/>a 12-note MOS differing from meantone[12] or something. OR, another<br/>possibility, is that it&apos;s an altered MOS scale in the same way that<br/>melodic minor is an altered diatonic.

For whatever reason, the pajara<br/>version turned out to excel in terms of 7-limit harmony, was about as<br/>close to having Myhill&apos;s property as you can really get, and ended up<br/>having a reasonably practical ET supporting it - 22.</p><p>But I just discovered this scale recently, so I don&apos;t yet have the<br/>foresight of knowing what this other direction to generalize it is.<br/>Right now I&apos;m seeing meantone, and after taking Cameron&apos;s advice and<br/>making a JI plot, it seemed augene and dimipent might work well too.<br/>Augene has been the best so far with 27-et as a potential ET<br/>candidate, although it&apos;s still far from as stellar as pajara and 22<br/>was for Paul.</p><p>&gt; No, but those that aren&apos;t are just variants on those that are, they simply have an L and an s permuted. But those ones cannot be described as rank-2 linear temperaments, because you can&apos;t make them with two generators. Pajara temperament uses a period of a half-octave or so and a generator of a fourth or so. In that sense, it&apos;s sort of a &quot;half-meantone&quot;.</p><p>Why wouldn&apos;t it be part of pajara if the relevant commas are still<br/>being tempered out? The 1/5-comma meantone melodic minor scale is<br/>still created from within the meantone framework and eliminates 81/80,<br/>even if it isn&apos;t formed from a contiguous chain of fifths...</p><p>&gt; It doesn&apos;t work that way in 22-tET, though. In that tuning, it is decidedly NOT a string of 10 fifths. Compare a scale of 10 22-tET fifths to that scale and you&apos;ll see it.</p><p>Yes, I&apos;m aware of that. I&apos;m saying that if you&apos;re starting in 12-tet,<br/>with this decatonic scale that you&apos;ve never thought of before, it<br/>might look just like a 10-note string of meantone fifths at first. To<br/>get to 22-tet, you have to find another way to look at it, which is<br/>what I&apos;m trying to do.</p><p>&gt; Do any other meantones have a 10-note MOS that looks like the standard pentachordal major? They actually don&apos;t. You&apos;ll get three step-sizes in any other meantone. The fact that both sharps and flats are mixed in should make that obvious. So treating the S.P.M. scale as a subset of meantone makes about as much sense as treating the diatonic scale as a subset of Blackwood-10 (i.e. try playing the major scale in 20-EDO).</p><p>Indeed. That&apos;s what I&apos;m trying to do here - find the equivalent of<br/>pajara for those decatonic scales with the octatonic scale I posted<br/>above. Something that ideally organizes beautifully into an MOS or<br/>almost-MOS, has stellar 7-limit harmonies, a low-numbered ET that<br/>supports it, etc. Augene is the best so far, although I&apos;m wondering if<br/>I can beat the 400 cent major thirds.</p><p>It should be mentioned though that at least on my scala<br/>implementation, the SPM isn&apos;t MOS by any definition of the word - the<br/>half-octave also comes in 11/8 and 16/11 flavors as well. That is,<br/>every interval has 2 step sizes except for that half-octave one, which<br/>has 3. But if I could find a linear temperament supporting this that<br/>was that close to MOS, I&apos;d be happy. Perhaps it&apos;s a subset from some<br/>brilliant 9- or 10- note MOS that I&apos;m not seeing.</p><p>&gt; If you want it strictly proper, diminished is the only way to go. Though this has more to do with the fact that you have 4L+4s=1200 cents, which means L+s=300 cents, than various commas or what have you. If you don&apos;t mind getting 3 step-sizes in the mix, the sky&apos;s the limit.</p><p>Proper would be fine here too, but why does it have to be diminished<br/>for strictly proper? Looking at Scala&apos;s fit mode stuff you&apos;re clearly<br/>right, as all of the SP ET&apos;s are multiples of 4, but how did you<br/>deduce that?</p><p>&gt; I guess you&apos;d get more helpful suggestions if we knew what you specifically wanted to accomplish and what you specifically wanted to preserve from 12-tET. Any old scale from 12-tET can be interpreted in as many ways as their are temperaments that 12-tET can reasonably said to support. Really, just about any temperament which generates a 12-note MOS can be considered to be compatible with 12-tET, I think? And if you follow Cameron&apos;s advice and formulate a JI version of the 12-tET scale, rather than looking at it from an altered-MOS perspective, you can find even more possibilities in other temperaments, since you&apos;d be eschewing the temperamental biases of 12-tET.</p><p>Hopefully this post has served to clarify my goals with all of this.<br/>As for Cameron&apos;s advice - that&apos;s how I came up with the Augene idea<br/>(Starling seemed like a good idea, and getting rid of 128/125 seemed<br/>like a good idea, and hence Augene). Hopefully if I keep at it I&apos;ll<br/>stumble across the Best Temperament There Is for this scale, although<br/>it would be nice if there was an algorithm to just get all of the<br/>linear temperaments supporting this scale, find out what the 7-limit<br/>error is for each one, sort them, and go from there. This implies that<br/>there&apos;s a way to define this scale outside of any particular<br/>temperament, which the idea of a &quot;temperament class&quot; would be good<br/>for, if it exists.</p><p>Gene&apos;s 31-et approach was a good start, although I missed Augene from<br/>that, so perhaps there&apos;s a way to generalize the concept (maybe 62-et<br/>or something?).

What you&apos;d have to do to get the SPM is probably get up to pajara[12], and then take a 10-note subset of that.  In 22-EDO, pajara[12] is 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 1, so to get a 10-note subset, you just add those 1-step intervals to one of the near-by 2-step intervals; in this way, you could get any of the decatonic scales.  But only the &quot;symmetric&quot; scales (in Paul&apos;s terms) are MOS, because pajara[10] is 2 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 3--because of the half-octave period.</p><p>&gt; Yes, I&apos;m aware of that. I&apos;m saying that if you&apos;re starting in 12-tet,<br/>&gt; with this decatonic scale that you&apos;ve never thought of before, it<br/>&gt; might look just like a 10-note string of meantone fifths at first.

Rank-2 temperaments will always produce MOS scales, because they are defined by a generator and a period.  To get a scale from a temperament, you just keep adding generators and normalizing by period.  I guess you could stop at a non-MOS point, though.

If you switch the first four steps, it&apos;s 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1, which is more generally LsLsLsLs.  But that order doesn&apos;t even really matter, what matters is ONLY that there are 4 large steps and 4 small steps.  As I said above, 4L+4s=1200 cents means L+s=300 cents; you don&apos;t need to know any commas to know that.  It&apos;s basic algebra.  So if you want to preserve having two step-sizes, you have to keep L+s=300 cents a constant.  You can also say 4L+4s=x-EDO, so L+s=x/4-EDO: that means you will be stuck working in EDOs divisible by 4 unless you&apos;re cool with 3 step-sizes...or working with a larger scale.  But the only way to get an 8-note scale with 4 large steps and 4 small steps, where the small steps are all the same size and the large steps are all the same size, is to work in an EDO divisible by 4--regardless of what other commas are tempered out.</p><p>&gt; Hopefully this post has served to clarify my goals with all of this.<br/>&gt; As for Cameron&apos;s advice - that&apos;s how I came up with the Augene idea<br/>&gt; (Starling seemed like a good idea, and getting rid of 128/125 seemed<br/>&gt; like a good idea, and hence Augene). Hopefully if I keep at it I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; stumble across the Best Temperament There Is for this scale, although<br/>&gt; it would be nice if there was an algorithm to just get all of the<br/>&gt; linear temperaments supporting this scale, find out what the 7-limit<br/>&gt; error is for each one, sort them, and go from there. This implies that<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a way to define this scale outside of any particular<br/>&gt; temperament, which the idea of a &quot;temperament class&quot; would be good<br/>&gt; for, if it exists.</p><p>The way to define this scale outside of a temperament is the way I outlined above, i.e. as an MOS scale defined by a pattern of large and small steps.  This approach works irrespective of commas, mappings, and errors.  You simply count the number of large steps, and the number of small steps, then you put it in form nL+ms.  If you want to find EDOs that support the scale, you just plug in different integers for L &amp; s; the integers you plug in are the &quot;steps out of the EDO&quot; you&apos;re solving for.  For instance, your scale is 4L+4s; with L=2 and s=1, we get 12-EDO because 4(2)+4(1)=8+4=12.  For L=3 and s=2, we get 4(3)+4(2)=12+8=20-EDO.  To get step-sizes in cents, you then just multiply 1200 by 3/20 and 2/20, getting 180 cents for L and 120 cents for s.</p><p>But as I keep repeating and you keep ignoring (or maybe you don&apos;t believe me?), there&apos;s no way to lump a bunch of MOS scales together into one temperament class just because they share the same scale-shape.  I went down that road recently, asking very much the same questions you are asking of this list, and that&apos;s the answer I got.  Temperament classes are defined by two things: mapping and error.  Knowing the mapping you want and the specific amount of error is what allows you to find a tuning for the generators of a temperament.  If you haven&apos;t specified an amount of error, you cannot define the tuning of the generators.  With the right (or rather, &quot;wrong&quot;) error value, you can make the Mavila scale with a Meantone mapping.  Or Gene gave me a great example of using 29 out of 36-EDO as a &quot;meantone&quot; generator to get a &quot;major third&quot; of 44/36, i.e. using an approximate 7/4 as a 3/2 to get an approximate 7/3 as a 5/4.  I also gave an example of looking at Mohajira as something like a &quot;16-comma Meantone&quot;; so you see, you can call ANY scale a Meantone if you allow for any amount of error.</p><p>To put it bluntly: there is never going to be a 1:1 correspondence between &quot;temperament class&quot; and MOS configuration, the way both are currently defined.  Are we clear?</p><p>To end on a positive note, let me try to actually help you meet your goal.  With a scale of sLsLLsLs, we know some notes are going be constant, because L+s=300 cents no matter what tuning we use, but others will vary:<br/>I: 0 cents<br/>II: s cents<br/>III: 300 cents<br/>IV: 300+s cents<br/>V: 600 cents<br/>VI: 600+L cents<br/>VII: 900 cents<br/>VIII: 900+L cents</p><p>You want good 7-limit implications.  That&apos;s not going to happen in this modal position, because there&apos;s no room in any of the variable degrees to get to a 7-limit concordance.  Let&apos;s switch to the LsLssLsL mode:</p><p>I: 0 cents<br/>II: L cents<br/>III: 300 cents<br/>IV: 300+L cents<br/>V: 600 cents<br/>VI: 600+s cents<br/>VII: 900 cents<br/>VIII: 900+s cents</p><p>We can make s something like 66.666... cents (round to 66.67) to get a 36-EDO tuning, which gives an L of 233 cents.  So we get: 0-233-300-533.33-600-666.67-900-966.67-1200 cents.  We could also try making L something like a 7/6 at 266.67 cents, making s 33.33 cents, giving 0-266.67-300-566.67-600-633.33-900-933.33-1200 cents.<br/>Going back to your mode of the scale, the first incarnation gives 0-66.67-300-366.67-600-833.33-900-1133.33-1200 cents.  The second incarnation gives 0-33.33-300-333.33-600-866.67-900-1166.67-1200 cents.</p><p>All of these suffer in both the 3 and 5 limits compared to the 12-EDO version, because of the fact that the 3rd, 5th, and 7th harmonics are all going to be approximated by deviations from 600, 300, and 900 cents (respectively), and to maintain two step-sizes, the 7th harmonic will have to be as far from 900 cents as the 3rd harmonic is from 600 cents.

The &quot;syntonic temperament&quot; as we<br/>were originally discussing seemed like it was defining things that<br/>way, but then ruined the whole concept by forcing the interpretations<br/>of 4 generators as 5. I think Graham has already worked this out...?</p><p>And, coming at it from the other angle, in 12-tet, the decatonic SPM<br/>scale is supported both by pajara and meantone, and perhaps other<br/>things too. From a &quot;pajara angle,&quot; it can be viewed as a near-MOS<br/>alteration of the symmetric decatonic scales, or perhaps pajara[12]<br/>minus 2. From a &quot;meantone angle,&quot; it can be viewed as a chain of 10<br/>meantone fifths, or perhaps meantone[12] minus 2. Both of these are<br/>alterations of nearby MOS&apos;s that different temperaments support, and<br/>they all become the same thing in 12-equal.</p><p>One that you&apos;ve pointed out is that it&apos;s very close (only a note or<br/>two off) from a diminished MOS. The only problem is that I&apos;m not sure<br/>diminished is really going to lead to really stellar 7-limit<br/>harmonies, and you could probably also come up with a diminished<br/>interpretation of the 12-tet decatonic scales as well. Looking at it<br/>from an augmented perspective naturally suggests augene, but then the<br/>5-limit harmonies suffer.

First we have to define how much you can temper a 3/2 before it stops being a 3/2, and how much we can temper a 5/4 before it stops being 5/4.  Otherwise we could call a 7/4 a 3/2, and make our 5/4 something like 7/3, since four 7/4&apos;s minus two octaves is something like a 7/3.  THEN, to avoid having an inconsistent tuning, we have to stipulate that four 3/2s is a BETTER approximation to 5/4 than any other number of 3/2&apos;s in the temperament.  If we do this, we can no longer have a continuous &quot;range&quot; of generators in the temperament.  Consider that a generator of 690 cents--squarely between 7-EDO and 12-EDO--produces a better 5/4 at a stack of 11, rather than a stack of 4 (690*11=7590 cents, subtract 7200 cents (6 octaves) and you get 390 cents.  690*4=2760 cents, subtract 2400 cents (two octaves) and you get 360 cents.  390 is closer to 5/4 than 360).</p><p>&gt; The syntonic temperament also defines 4/3&gt;5/4&gt;6/5 because it is at those points that the 5 Large 2 Small diatonic scale exists.</p><p>This actually has nothing to do with tempering the syntonic comma, or those JI ratios.  It can be expressed entirely in terms of generators and periods, as: (-1gen+1per)&gt;(4gen-2per)&gt;(-3gen+2per).  If we take the period to be an octave and solve for a value of the generator, we see that only generators between 3-of-5-EDO and 4-of-7-EDO fit the bill.  Approximation to JI never enters the equation at any point.  So the &quot;syntonic temperament&quot; is actually not a temperament but a range of MOS scale generators that will produce a scale of 5L+2s=1 octave.</p><p>I don&apos;t mean to shoot the messenger, of course.

Any tuning that supports a scale of 4L+4s will support any arrangement of those steps, be it ssssLLLL or ssLLsLsL or whatever.

Any time you are talking about temperament, be it a specific temperament, a temperament class, or a temperament &quot;super-class&quot;, you&apos;re stuck with concepts of mappings, commas, errors, and consistencies.  To somehow lump all LLsLLLs scales together into a temperament class or super-class, you&apos;d have to do the following things:<br/>1: find some mapping that they all have in common<br/>2: define your error range such it gives generators only between 4/7ths of an octave and 3/5ths of an octave, which will be arbitrary<br/>3: ignore consistency completely</p><p>&gt; The idea is that meantone and superpyth are obviously related because<br/>&gt; they both produce LLsLLLs scales, although they map the intervals in<br/>&gt; them differently.</p><p>The unifying feature here is the scale shape, not the mapping; temperament is ALL ABOUT MAPPING.

Or you could equate both of<br/>&gt; these and get 12-tet.</p><p>&gt; Is there some way to find some kind of general &quot;temperament class&quot;<br/>&gt; that meantone and superpyth are both a part of, since they both<br/>&gt; produce 5+2 scales? Or some way to formalize all of that?</p><p>Dear Mike (and Caleb),</p><p>Thank you for raising a very important question to which I<br/>believe there is a good answer actually defined by Easley<br/>Blackwood, Jr.</p><p>All the temperaments you are describing from 7-EDO (685.71c) to<br/>5-EDO (720.00c) are &quot;regular diatonic&quot; tunings. Of course, there<br/>are many other wonderful generators, but this is the range where<br/>a chain of six fifths give us a regular diatonic scale of the<br/>LLsLLLs pattern.</p><p>What we&apos;d also like is a term analogous to &quot;meantone,&quot; but<br/>describing any tuning in this regular diatonic range where a<br/>&quot;major third&quot; from four fifths up (less two octaves) is formed<br/>from two identically sized &quot;major seconds&quot; or &quot;tones,&quot; each in<br/>turn formed from two fifths up (less an octave).</p><p>Here I propose the term &quot;isotone,&quot; meaning that a major third is<br/>formed from two tones of the &quot;same&quot; size.</p><p>To take your example, a fifth at 709 cents produces a major<br/>second at 218 cents, and two of these 218-cent tones gives us a<br/>major third at 436 cents, very close to 9/7 (435.08 cents). This<br/>is an isotone, because we get the 436-cent major third from two<br/>identical 218-cent tones; or, each tone is precisely half the<br/>size of the major third.</p><p>While all meantones are isotones, not all isotones are<br/>meantones. Our 709-cent temperament, close to 22-EDO, tempers out<br/>the 64:63, the septimal or Archytan comma (9/7 vs. 81/64), not<br/>the syntonic comma of meantone at 81:80 (5/4 vs. 81/64).</p><p>Here are some examples of isotones at different points along the<br/>regular diatonic continuum, with the medieval and later Dorian<br/>mode, LsLLLsL, used to illustrate the common pattern.</p><p>  Inframeantone, 689c</p><p>  0     178   333    511    689    867   1022   1200<br/>    178    155   178     178    178   155    178<br/>     L      s     L       L      L     s      L</p><p>In an inframeantone as I define it, the regular larger and<br/>smaller thirds, here 356 and 333 cents, will both be in a range<br/>between 330 and 372 cents which might be termed neutral, or, near<br/>the low and high ends, &quot;semi-neutral&quot; or supraminor/submajor.<br/>Note that the tone (L) and semitone (S) differ in size by only<br/>23 cents, but do fit a regular diatonic pattern! For the 356-cent<br/>major or rather largish neutral third, close for example to 27/22<br/>(355 cents), we might speak of &quot;tempering out&quot; the 33:32 diesis<br/>(53 cents), the difference between four 3/2 fifths up at 81/64<br/>and a 27/22 neutral third.</p><p>  Meantone, 696c (50-EDO)</p><p>  0     192   312    504    696    888   1008   1200<br/>    192    120   192     192    192   120    192<br/>     L      s     L       L      L     s      L</p><p>This is a typical meantone not too far from Zarlino&apos;s 2/7-comma,<br/>in the &quot;central&quot; range of around 1/3-1/6 comma favored for<br/>keyboards in 16th-17th century Europe. The term &quot;syntonic<br/>temperament,&quot; as has been observed, would seem logically<br/>synonymous with meantone, since the 81/80 is tempered out to<br/>produce regular thirds at or close to 5/4 and 6/5.</p><p>   Pythagorean, 3/2 or 701.955c</p><p>  1/1     9/8   32/27    4/3     3/2    27/16  16/9      2/1<br/>   0      204    294     498     702     906    996     1200<br/>      9:8   256:243  9:8     9:8     9:8   256:243  9:8<br/>      204     90     204     204     204      90    204</p><p>This is the classic Pythagorean diatonic of medieval Europe, for<br/>example, which doesn&apos;t temper out the 81:80 but has major and<br/>minor thirds at 408 and 294 cents, a syntonic comma larger and<br/>smaller respectively than 5/4 and 6/5.

We&apos;ve already done it. The category of linear temperaments with<br/>generators between 3/5 and 4/7 and periods of an octave ends up<br/>meeting the criteria.</p><p>&gt; To somehow lump all LLsLLLs scales together into a temperament class or super-class, you&apos;d have to do the following things:<br/>&gt; 1: find some mapping that they all have in common<br/>&gt; 2: define your error range such it gives generators only between 4/7ths of an octave and 3/5ths of an octave, which will be arbitrary<br/>&gt; 3: ignore consistency completely</p><p>I disagree that a common mapping is necessary. Superpyth and meantone<br/>have two completely different mappings, but they both produce 5+2<br/>scales, even if those aren&apos;t specifically tied into the 5-limit<br/>anymore.</p><p>&gt; The unifying feature here is the scale shape, not the mapping; temperament is ALL ABOUT MAPPING. If the mapping is different, the temperament is different.

You can find some way to play this scale with 3 or 4 step sizes in probably any EDO above 12. So you could just look at EDOs that have good harmonic characteristics, and shoe-horn your scale into them and see what happens.

So one configuration is 14L+15s, if you make 12 into 3+2+3+2+2; another is 20L+6s if you make 12 into 3+3+3+3.  They&apos;re pretty big and you could make smaller subsets of them if you wanted, but there you have it.  You could tune the former scale in 43-EDO and the latter variation in 46-EDO.  But I guess this goes to show you that sometimes, when dealing with scales with more than 2 step-sizes (what&apos;s the word for only having two step-sizes again?  I can never keep all those terms straight) and especially in higher EDOs, there can be more than one &quot;parent&quot; scale.</p><p>&gt; Right. I think what this is pointing to is that the sLsLLsLs 12-tet<br/>&gt; incarnation of this would probably be better off having 3 step sizes,<br/>&gt; two of which are equated in 12-equal, and the comma between them<br/>&gt; tempered out.</p><p>Whatever you desire, Mike.  It&apos;s your scale, you can take it anywhere!</p><p>&gt; Why? We&apos;ve already done it. The category of linear temperaments with<br/>&gt; generators between 3/5 and 4/7 and periods of an octave ends up<br/>&gt; meeting the criteria.</p><p>Defined that way, that&apos;s not a category of linear temperaments.  At least, not in the way the term &quot;linear temperament&quot; is used here.</p><p>&gt; &gt; To somehow lump all LLsLLLs scales together into a temperament class or super-class, you&apos;d have to do the following things:<br/>&gt; &gt; 1: find some mapping that they all have in common<br/>&gt; &gt; 2: define your error range such it gives generators only between 4/7ths of an octave and 3/5ths of an octave, which will be arbitrary<br/>&gt; &gt; 3: ignore consistency completely</p><p>&gt; I disagree that a common mapping is necessary. Superpyth and meantone<br/>&gt; have two completely different mappings, but they both produce 5+2<br/>&gt; scales, even if those aren&apos;t specifically tied into the 5-limit<br/>&gt; anymore.</p><p>Without a mapping, we&apos;re no longer talking about temperament, or anything related to temperament.  You keep trying to use the term &quot;temperament&quot; in a way that is inconsistent with how it&apos;s defined here.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The unifying feature here is the scale shape, not the mapping; temperament is ALL ABOUT MAPPING. If the mapping is different, the temperament is different. OTOH, Moment of Symmetry is ALL ABOUT SCALE SHAPE, and could give a damn about mapping or JI.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I still don&apos;t get what you&apos;re so resistant to this idea for. Nothing<br/>&gt; I&apos;m saying changes anything about regular mapping, it&apos;s just that you<br/>&gt; can show how temperaments are related through the MOS&apos;s they produce.<br/>&gt; The fact that superpyth aeolian and meantone aeolian have as much of a<br/>&gt; similarity as they do suggests that this would be a perceptually<br/>&gt; useful grouping to make.</p><p>I&apos;m not resistant to anything, except imprecise or misused language. You keep wanting to call an MOS family a temperament super-class, it seems, and I don&apos;t understand why.  Temperament classes have no natural boundaries, but MOS families do.  Anything can be a meantone, anything can be a superpyth, but not everything can be 5L+2s.  It happens to be true that there are several temperaments whose optimal generators all fall in the same range that produces MOS scales of 5L+2s, but those temperaments also have non-optimal generators that fall within every other MOS family.  And not nearly every generator in the 5L+2s MOS family will be an optimal or near-optimal generator for a temperament-class.</p><p>But sure, you could certainly look at a list of optimal and near-optimal generators for different temperament classes and index them according to MOS families they belong to.<br/>It&apos;d be a bit tedious, though.  And MOS families are actually somewhat difficult to pin down unless you set a maximum number of notes.  It is interesting to note, for instance, that 19-EDO and 22-EDO share the same 7-note LLsLLLs scale, but have opposite 12-note scales (19&apos;s is LsLsLLsLsLsL, or 7L+5s, whereas 22&apos;s is LsLssLsLsLss, or 5L+7s)--are they REALLY in the same MOS family?  Likewise, 22 and 27 have the same 12-note MOS, but a different 22-note MOS.  So if we group only according to a 7-note MOS, we may be blurring important distinctions.  So now we have the burden of arbitrarily defining a limit to MOS size, or else indexing each tuning according to multiple levels of MOS.</p><p>&gt; I think, after doing some &quot;light reading&quot; (lol, that&apos;s a joke), I<br/>&gt; think this is really the same basic thing that Graham has proposed by<br/>&gt; giving the MOS scales names to begin with. (And what names they are.)</p><p>Actually, those names were a result of me asking the list if there was a nice precise &quot;scientific-sounding&quot; way to name different MOS families several years back.  There wasn&apos;t, so Graham furnished the next best thing.  After years of consideration and trying (and failing) to find better alternatives, I&apos;ve come to prefer the nL+ms approach.  I do occasionally nurture a pipe-dream of concocting a true taxonomy of MOS scales, with 3- to 5-note scales being the &quot;Kingdom&quot;, 6- to 9-note scales being the &quot;Phylum&quot;, etc.  But the exactly-equal scales throw me off, since they are between branches.</p><p>&gt; So perhaps a database of what MOS&apos;s are supported by what linear<br/>&gt; temperaments would be helpful. I need to work on that.</p><p>&quot;What MOS&apos;S are supported by what optimal (or near-optimal) *tunings* of what linear temperaments&quot; is how you should have wrote that.  Remember, a temperament is just a mapping; you need to define error to get a tuning, and without having the tuning of a temperament, there&apos;s no way to categorize it in terms of MOS family.</p><p>&gt; Yeah, I realize that now. I guess that approach to organizing<br/>&gt; temperaments isn&apos;t the way to go - I&apos;d rather go with the above<br/>&gt; approach instead.</p><p>I wonder what the name for that approach is...sort of brute-forcing a JI scale to the nearest approximation each step has in a given tuning, regardless of whether the tuning is consistent to the same limit as the JI scale.</p><p>&gt; Indeed. What I really wish I had were some tools to make all of this<br/>&gt; easier. Maybe tonalsoft&apos;s the way to go... What have you been using?</p><p>Uh...TextEdit and Calculator?  When I had a PC, I would occasionally use Scala, but not for anything analytical or what have you, just to tune up different scales to play on my computer keyboard (before I had any other retunable synths and MIDI controllers).

Superpyth and meantone are two examples of temperaments with<br/>different mappings that still produce 5+2 scales. You seem to be<br/>agreeing with me, so I don&apos;t know why you&apos;re disagreeing with me.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I still don&apos;t get what you&apos;re so resistant to this idea for.

You keep wanting to call an MOS family a temperament super-class, it seems, and I don&apos;t understand why.</p><p>If the term for what I am describing already exists and is called &quot;MOS<br/>family,&quot; and meantone and superpyth can be said to belong to the<br/>diatonic MOS family, then I&apos;ll use that term instead. I used the<br/>phrase &quot;temperament class&quot; to indicate that the concept I was getting<br/>across was a way of categorizing temperaments into groups or &quot;classes&quot;<br/>with perceptual similarities. But then it turns out that Graham had<br/>already used the phrase &quot;temperament class&quot; to describe something like<br/>meantone or porcupine, so I started using the term &quot;temperament<br/>superclass&quot; to indicate that it was a group of &quot;temperament classes&quot;<br/>with perceptual similarities. Now you&apos;re saying that it&apos;s called an<br/>MOS family, so if it is then I&apos;ll start using that term. I don&apos;t<br/>really care what it&apos;s called.</p><p>The reason I picked the term &quot;temperament superclass&quot; is that<br/>superpyth and meantone are obviously very much perceptually related in<br/>a way that meantone and porcupine are not, which lends itself to a<br/>taxonomy whereby there is some larger concept of which meantone and<br/>superpyth are subcategories.</p><p>&gt; Temperament classes have no natural boundaries, but MOS families do. Anything can be a meantone, anything can be a superpyth, but not everything can be 5L+2s. It happens to be true that there are several temperaments whose optimal generators all fall in the same range that produces MOS scales of 5L+2s, but those temperaments also have non-optimal generators that fall within every other MOS family. And not nearly every generator in the 5L+2s MOS family will be an optimal or near-optimal generator for a temperament-class.</p><p>Right, I understand very well that you could say that a meantone<br/>generator is 1199 cents and the period is 1200 cents. I&apos;m not dodging<br/>that point because I don&apos;t understand it, I&apos;m dodging it because I<br/>think we all have a decent &quot;common sense&quot; definition of what<br/>constitutes a meantone and what doesn&apos;t, and that rigorously defining<br/>it isn&apos;t necessary at this point to flesh out how temperaments fall<br/>into larger perceptual categories.</p><p>&gt; But sure, you could certainly look at a list of optimal and near-optimal generators for different temperament classes and index them according to MOS families they belong to.</p><p>aaaaaaa HAAAA! You admit it! :)</p><p>&gt; It&apos;d be a bit tedious, though. And MOS families are actually somewhat difficult to pin down unless you set a maximum number of notes. It is interesting to note, for instance, that 19-EDO and 22-EDO share the same 7-note LLsLLLs scale, but have opposite 12-note scales (19&apos;s is LsLsLLsLsLsL, or 7L+5s, whereas 22&apos;s is LsLssLsLsLss, or 5L+7s)--are they REALLY in the same MOS family?</p><p>And likewise, mavila and meantone share the same 5 note ssLsL scale,<br/>but have opposite 7-note MOS&apos;s. So mavila and meantone and superpyth<br/>would both be in the 2+3 MOS family, but mavila wouldn&apos;t be in the 5+2<br/>MOS family, and the remaining two would diverge for the 12-note MOS<br/>family.</p><p>&gt; Likewise, 22 and 27 have the same 12-note MOS, but a different 22-note MOS. So if we group only according to a 7-note MOS, we may be blurring important distinctions. So now we have the burden of arbitrarily defining a limit to MOS size, or else indexing each tuning according to multiple levels of MOS.</p><p>That is a good point. What do you think would be best?</p><p>An idea I just had - perhaps that&apos;s one common sense way to delimit a<br/>temperament&apos;s range. So we could say that meantone is only meantone if<br/>the generator produces both 5+2 and 7+5 scales, (or equal variants<br/>thereof). This means that a lower bound for meantone is 7-tet,<br/>exclusive, and an upper bound for meantone is 12-tet, inclusive.</p><p>Yes... I like this idea a lot :) Seems like it might lead to something<br/>interesting. I also wonder, just as you can specify a linear<br/>temperament by two ET&apos;s, what can you specify by two MOS&apos;s? Some<br/>higher-limit generalization of MOS?</p><p>&gt; Actually, those names were a result of me asking the list if there was a nice precise &quot;scientific-sounding&quot; way to name different MOS families several years back. There wasn&apos;t, so Graham furnished the next best thing. After years of consideration and trying (and failing) to find better alternatives, I&apos;ve come to prefer the nL+ms approach.

I would support this initiative and would like<br/>to do some work on it myself. After spending all of this time with<br/>regular mapping, my head was turned completely upside down when Paul<br/>pointed out that superpyth minor scales and meantone minor scales<br/>sounded perceptually &quot;the same.&quot; So after thinking that JI was some<br/>kind of underlying reality that regular mapping was &quot;warping,&quot; I don&apos;t<br/>even think that anymore.</p><p>That is, the question really is - do JI intervals and triads have<br/>their own inherent &quot;identity?&quot; Is it that tempering &quot;connects&quot;<br/>different pieces of the JI lattice and smear identities together? Or<br/>is there something else fundamentally going on? Paul&apos;s example<br/>certainly seems to suggest the latter. Thus your proposed MOS taxonomy<br/>might be a more useful way of categorizing this particular element of<br/>musical perception, with regular mapping then taking the role of<br/>finding the generator that produces the most concordant chords - which<br/>is a completely different level of perception, and may be more<br/>reducible to a simple notion of &quot;concordant&quot; and &quot;discordant&quot; with<br/>different JI intonations just implying subtly different flavors.</p><p>Perhaps a larger discussion of &quot;the big picture&quot; is really necessary<br/>to produce your taxonomy.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So perhaps a database of what MOS&apos;s are supported by what linear<br/>&gt; &gt; temperaments would be helpful. I need to work on that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;What MOS&apos;S are supported by what optimal (or near-optimal) *tunings* of what linear temperaments&quot; is how you should have wrote that. Remember, a temperament is just a mapping; you need to define error to get a tuning, and without having the tuning of a temperament, there&apos;s no way to categorize it in terms of MOS family.</p><p>Well, if we tie meantone down to having generators that can produce<br/>both the 5+2 and 7+5 families, there goes that problem :) And I think<br/>that&apos;s pretty close to how we all intuitively decide to stop calling<br/>something meantone anyway.</p><p>So if we place those limits on what are allowable generators for a<br/>linear temperament, then it implies a natural taxonomy by itself.<br/>Meantone and superpyth would be related in that they&apos;re both part of<br/>the &quot;diatonic&quot; (or isotonic if we use Margo&apos;s terminology) family, but<br/>meantone would be a part of the &quot;chromatic&quot; family, whereas superpyth<br/>would be a part of the inverted chromatic family.

This means that a lower bound for meantone is 7-tet,<br/>&gt; exclusive, and an upper bound for meantone is 12-tet, inclusive.<br/>//snip<br/>&gt; Well, if we tie meantone down to having generators that can produce<br/>&gt; both the 5+2 and 7+5 families, there goes that problem :) And I think<br/>&gt; that&apos;s pretty close to how we all intuitively decide to stop calling<br/>&gt; something meantone anyway.</p><p>To quickly add to this, I just realized that all temperaments that<br/>produce both 5+2 and 7+5 scales would have to produce 5+2 scales that<br/>are Rothenberg equivalence classes of one another. That is, any 5+2<br/>scale that has a generator that also produces a 7+5 chromatic scale -<br/>so a generator between 7-tet and 12-tet exclusive - will have the same<br/>rank-order matrix for any other LLsLLLs scale in the same range.</p><p>In another freak coincidence that I&apos;m sure is not a coincidence, this<br/>is also the range in which the LLsLLLs is strictly proper.

Is it that we formulating a<br/>microtonal approach to music set theory that abstractly uses linear<br/>temperaments as its basis instead of equal temperaments?

Thus, for example, +4 fifths is around 81/64;<br/>-8 fifths is around 5/4; and +16 fifths is around 9/7.<br/>The latter two approximations show the two &quot;schismatic&quot;<br/>relationships.</p><p>At the lower boundary, 12-EDO, the regular (+4 fifths)<br/>and schismic (-8 fifths) major thirds are an identical<br/>400 cents, either of which could be seen as an approximation<br/>of either 81/64 or 5/4. Thus 12-EDO is on the boundary<br/>between meantone and a region which could be called schismic<br/>or schismatic, although with the qualification that it<br/>doesn&apos;t have any close septimal approximations.</p><p>The center of the schismic region would be around Pythagorean,<br/>including also things like 135-EDO and 41-EDO. Here +4 fifths<br/>give a good approximation or 81/64 (or exactly yield it in<br/>Pythagorean); while -8 fifths yield an approximate 5/4.</p><p>When we go as far as 29-EDO, however, the equation has<br/>changed enough that I would say we are at the upper limit<br/>of schismic or schismatic and the lower limit of a new<br/>region.</p><p>First, -8 fifths gives us around 372 cents, which some might<br/>regard as a rather inaccurate approximation of 5/4 (386 cents),<br/>but which could also be regarded as a reasonable approximation<br/>of 26/21, for example (370 cents). Ozan Yarman and I have<br/>independently concluded that 29-EDO is around the point where<br/>submajor/supraminor thirds start to be reasonably approximated<br/>by the same pathway, -8/+9 fifths (diminished fourth for submajor<br/>and augmented second for supraminor), as yields 5-limit<br/>approximations in the schismic range (e.g. Pythagorean).</p><p>Secondly, the 12-vector at some 41 cents is much larger<br/>than 81:80 or 64:63, and in fact a bit larger than the<br/>128:125 or 1/4-comma meantone! And we no longer get the<br/>septimal approximations of Pythagorean, 135-EDO, or 41-EDO,<br/>but what I term &quot;interseptimal&quot; approximations very close<br/>to 13:10 and 15:13. For example, in Pythagorean, +14 fifths<br/>(9:8 plus 12-vector) gives a slightly narrow 8:7; here<br/>it gives a near-just 15:13.</p><p>Thus I might say that 29-EDO is the beginning of a<br/>&quot;Zalzalian-diesic&quot; region. This means that thirds of<br/>-8/+9 fifths are in a &quot;Zalzalian&quot; (neutral/submajor/supraminor)<br/>range of about 330-372 cents, rather than close to 5-limit<br/>in the schismic range or 12-EDO to 29-EDO (400-372 cents).<br/>And the &quot;diesic&quot; part of the name tells us that the 12-vector<br/>has grown from a comma to a diesis -- in fact, one comparable<br/>in size to that of a classic meantone in the range of negative<br/>tunings.</p><p>Another landmark at 29-EDO is that -13 fifths, for example,<br/>becomes as good an approximation of 9/7 as +16 fifths: another<br/>sign telling us that we&apos;re entering a new realm.</p><p>The Zalzalian-diesic region would go from 29-EDO to 17-EDO,<br/>the point where the diminished fourth and augmented second<br/>are the same size, and also where +4 fifths becomes as good<br/>an approximation of 9/7, for example, as -13 fifths.</p><p>Note that my criteria for drawing lines are in part<br/>subjective -- &quot;Isn&apos;t -8 fifths close enough to 26/21<br/>that it could at least as well be described as a<br/>submajor third as an inaccurate 5/4 major third?&quot;<br/>And in part they&apos;re objective: &quot;Here is where +15 fifths<br/>is as good a 7/4 as -14 fourths.&quot;</p><p>Defining and naming regions can certainly reflect one&apos;s<br/>priorities!

To be MOS, the scale has to be directly generated by a series of generators that wrap around at a period, and the moment of symmetry occurs any time the generator sequence makes a scale of only two step-sizes.  But for instance the melodic minor has two step-sizes but is not an MOS, because it is not made by a single chain of generators in a given period.  To get the melodic minor, you have to take the diatonic scale and swap a step around.  So a scale can have two step-sizes but not be MOS.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Defined that way, that&apos;s not a category of linear temperaments. At least, not in the way the term &quot;linear temperament&quot; is used here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not? If it has a single generator and a single period, it&apos;s a<br/>&gt; linear temperament.</p><p>Actually, no, it&apos;s not.  To be a temperament, it has to have a mapping and an amount of error.  Otherwise it&apos;s just a plain ol&apos; MOS.  If you don&apos;t believe me, ask Gene or Graham about it.</p><p>&gt; And I just placed them within a category, with my<br/>&gt; category superpowers. Besides, after Margo just fleshed all of that<br/>&gt; out... what&apos;s the debate about at this point? :)</p><p>Margo named some temperaments that coincide with some MOS scales in what she calls the &quot;isotonic&quot; range, which I call 3\5-4\7.  What IS the debate about at this point?  Whether you should be allowed to call two temperaments with different mappings the same temperament?</p><p>&gt; If the term for what I am describing already exists and is called &quot;MOS<br/>&gt; family,&quot; and meantone and superpyth can be said to belong to the<br/>&gt; diatonic MOS family, then I&apos;ll use that term instead. I used the<br/>&gt; phrase &quot;temperament class&quot; to indicate that the concept I was getting<br/>&gt; across was a way of categorizing temperaments into groups or &quot;classes&quot;<br/>&gt; with perceptual similarities. But then it turns out that Graham had<br/>&gt; already used the phrase &quot;temperament class&quot; to describe something like<br/>&gt; meantone or porcupine, so I started using the term &quot;temperament<br/>&gt; superclass&quot; to indicate that it was a group of &quot;temperament classes&quot;<br/>&gt; with perceptual similarities. Now you&apos;re saying that it&apos;s called an<br/>&gt; MOS family, so if it is then I&apos;ll start using that term. I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; really care what it&apos;s called.</p><p>It&apos;s just that &quot;temperament&quot; implies a specific approach, i.e. one involving mappings.  The fact that multiple temperaments can fit in one MOS family has nothing to do explicitly with what comma(s) they temper out (i.e. what mapping(s) they have).<br/>Let me try an analogy: you&apos;re at a dog show, and you notice that the representatives of some breeds have black coats, while others have white coats or brown or spotted.  You propose to the American Kennel Club that they should classify breeds into &quot;super-breeds&quot; where all the dogs with black coats belong to one super-breed, all the dogs with brown coats to another, etc.  You clearly are missing the point that &quot;breed&quot; has nothing to do with &quot;color&quot;, i.e. that one breed can be many colors and that &quot;coat color&quot; is not a determining factor in what breed a dog is in the first place.  Calling all dogs with the same coat-color a &quot;super-breed&quot; misses the point about what a breed is in the first place.</p><p>Calling it a &quot;temperament super-class&quot; would make sense if you were lumping together all the temperaments that had something about their mappings in common, i.e. that they all temper out 81/80 (but may temper out different additional commas).  In fact, this already seems to be routinely done, if you look at Gene&apos;s Wiki articles on various temperaments and their &quot;children&quot;.</p><p>&gt; The reason I picked the term &quot;temperament superclass&quot; is that<br/>&gt; superpyth and meantone are obviously very much perceptually related in<br/>&gt; a way that meantone and porcupine are not, which lends itself to a<br/>&gt; taxonomy whereby there is some larger concept of which meantone and<br/>&gt; superpyth are subcategories.</p><p>Yes, but the relationship has nothing to do with their properties as temperaments, but rather, their properties as MOS scales.  It is the case that a specific tuning for a rank-2 temperament can also be used to define an MOS scale, and that&apos;s probably why you&apos;re confused about the difference between the two.  It&apos;s just that if you ONLY have the tuning for a temperament, and not its mapping, there&apos;s no way to say what temperament it actually is.</p><p>&gt; Right, I understand very well that you could say that a meantone<br/>&gt; generator is 1199 cents and the period is 1200 cents. I&apos;m not dodging<br/>&gt; that point because I don&apos;t understand it, I&apos;m dodging it because I<br/>&gt; think we all have a decent &quot;common sense&quot; definition of what<br/>&gt; constitutes a meantone and what doesn&apos;t, and that rigorously defining<br/>&gt; it isn&apos;t necessary at this point to flesh out how temperaments fall<br/>&gt; into larger perceptual categories.</p><p>Is our common-sense definition enough?  Is 686 cents a meantone generator?  Is 690 cents?    If they are, then why isn&apos;t 703 cents?  If they aren&apos;t, what are they?  When you get away from TOP meantone (or some other optimized meantone), it becomes very difficult to say what is and isn&apos;t a meantone, even by common-sense definitions.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But sure, you could certainly look at a list of optimal and near-optimal generators for different temperament classes and index them according to MOS families they belong to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; aaaaaaa HAAAA! You admit it! :)</p><p>Note the words &quot;optimal&quot; and &quot;near-optimal&quot;.  You need to have specific tunings for each temperament before any such indexing is possible.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It&apos;d be a bit tedious, though. And MOS families are actually somewhat difficult to pin down unless you set a maximum number of notes. It is interesting to note, for instance, that 19-EDO and 22-EDO share the same 7-note LLsLLLs scale, but have opposite 12-note scales (19&apos;s is LsLsLLsLsLsL, or 7L+5s, whereas 22&apos;s is LsLssLsLsLss, or 5L+7s)--are they REALLY in the same MOS family?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Likewise, 22 and 27 have the same 12-note MOS, but a different 22-note MOS. So if we group only according to a 7-note MOS, we may be blurring important distinctions. So now we have the burden of arbitrarily defining a limit to MOS size, or else indexing each tuning according to multiple levels of MOS.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is a good point. What do you think would be best?</p><p>I have no solid ideas as of yet.</p><p>&gt; An idea I just had - perhaps that&apos;s one common sense way to delimit a<br/>&gt; temperament&apos;s range. So we could say that meantone is only meantone if<br/>&gt; the generator produces both 5+2 and 7+5 scales, (or equal variants<br/>&gt; thereof). This means that a lower bound for meantone is 7-tet,<br/>&gt; exclusive, and an upper bound for meantone is 12-tet, inclusive.</p><p>Why inclusive of 12-tET?  12-tET doesn&apos;t support either 5+7 or 7+5.  If you&apos;re going to exclude 7, you should exclude 12, or else you should include both.  But it doesn&apos;t make sense to say that 7-EDO is &quot;neither&quot; 5+2 nor 2+5 but that 12-tET is &quot;both&quot; 7+5 and 5+7.</p><p>I went down this road a while back, though.  I&apos;ll post a spreadsheet graphic I made where I listed the MOS families defined by branches on the Stern-Brocot tree, looking for patterns that would correlate to temperament classes.  I too thought that we could define the range of a temperament class by MOS families of sufficiently-large size, and I too got very excited by this idea, thinking I&apos;d found the missing link between linear temperaments and MOS families.  But after some probing of the list and some long meditation, I came to the conclusion that I had not.</p><p>Why did I conclude this?  Because there are too many ways to invalidate the perceptual similarities on which the grouping is supposed to be based.  Consider the problem that from 3\5-4\7, when you pass a certain point heading toward either end of the spectrum, the scale STOPS sounding like 5L+2s and starts sounding like 5-EDO or 7-EDO, so the perceptual grouping also stops making sense.  I have not succeeded in finding that point.</p><p>Also, there is the fact that whatever limit we impose on temperament classes is going to be arbitrary from a temperament perspective.  We don&apos;t have a way to validate our distinctions, IOW.  And as Herman suggested, and I keep trying to get through to you, temperament tunings vary in consistency across a given pitch-range.  690 cents is an inconsistent tuning for Meantone, equally as inconsistent as 709 cents is, in fact.  From a perspective of both error and consistency, neither should be considered a meantone, yet 690 cents is squarely between 12-EDO and 7-EDO.</p><p>&gt; Yes... I like this idea a lot :) Seems like it might lead to something<br/>&gt; interesting. I also wonder, just as you can specify a linear<br/>&gt; temperament by two ET&apos;s, what can you specify by two MOS&apos;s? Some<br/>&gt; higher-limit generalization of MOS?</p><p>No, giving two MOS&apos;s is pointless because the higher one implies the lower one.</p><p>&gt; What really gets me is how really fundamental to musical perception<br/>&gt; the scale taxonomy is. I would support this initiative and would like<br/>&gt; to do some work on it myself. After spending all of this time with<br/>&gt; regular mapping, my head was turned completely upside down when Paul<br/>&gt; pointed out that superpyth minor scales and meantone minor scales<br/>&gt; sounded perceptually &quot;the same.&quot; So after thinking that JI was some<br/>&gt; kind of underlying reality that regular mapping was &quot;warping,&quot; I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; even think that anymore.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That is, the question really is - do JI intervals and triads have<br/>&gt; their own inherent &quot;identity?&quot; Is it that tempering &quot;connects&quot;<br/>&gt; different pieces of the JI lattice and smear identities together? Or<br/>&gt; is there something else fundamentally going on? Paul&apos;s example<br/>&gt; certainly seems to suggest the latter. Thus your proposed MOS taxonomy<br/>&gt; might be a more useful way of categorizing this particular element of<br/>&gt; musical perception, with regular mapping then taking the role of<br/>&gt; finding the generator that produces the most concordant chords - which<br/>&gt; is a completely different level of perception, and may be more<br/>&gt; reducible to a simple notion of &quot;concordant&quot; and &quot;discordant&quot; with<br/>&gt; different JI intonations just implying subtly different flavors.</p><p>If such a taxonomy proves to be possible, I have no doubt that it may prove useful.  But I have my doubts about its possibility.  I haven&apos;t given up on it, though, and it&apos;s nice to see someone else interested in the project (finally)!</p><p>&gt; Well, if we tie meantone down to having generators that can produce<br/>&gt; both the 5+2 and 7+5 families, there goes that problem :) And I think<br/>&gt; that&apos;s pretty close to how we all intuitively decide to stop calling<br/>&gt; something meantone anyway.</p><p>Not quite.

With these tunings, either you&apos;re inconsistent or you&apos;re using a different temperament.  So the idea is that the range of the syntonic temperament is not continuous, but rather made up of &quot;patches&quot; where the temperament is consistent separated by patches where it&apos;s inconsistent but another temperament *is* consistent.  See Herman Miller&apos;s post from a few days ago where he linked to some graphs of consistency for different generators for various temperament classes.  They look like fractals.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=92237 href="#92237">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2010 12:45:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Tue, Aug 31, 2010 at 11:51 AM, genewardsmith<br/>&lt;genewardsmith@...t&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Congratulations; you&apos;ve just discovered Golden Meantone.

The tree itself is a recurrent sequence: you start with the nodes 0/1, 1/1, and 1/0.  The next nodes are 0+1/1+1 and 1+1/1+0, i.e. 1/2 and 2/1, which can be read &quot;1 out of 2-EDO&quot; and &quot;2 out of 1-EDO&quot; if we&apos;re dealing with scales of an octave period.  Then you make the next branches as 1+1/2+1, 1+0/2+1, 2+1/1+1, and 2+1/1+0, or 2/3, 1/3, 3/2, and 3/1.

So the consistency limit of a meantone tuning with a 690 cent generator would be 11 (meaning that any scale with 11 or fewer notes in a contiguous chain of generators is consistent, but if you add a 12th note, the 11-fifths interval would make it inconsistent). On the other hand, any scale with a 680-cent generator is inconsistent with meantone, since 4 octaves up minus 3 fifths down is a better fifth than the &quot;meantone&quot; version.</p></div><h3><a id=92256 href="#92256">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2010 7:16:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    The other problem of omitting the MOS at the EDO is that MOS<br/>&gt; is conceived within the concept of a continuum of possible<br/>&gt; generators which is illustrated graphically in numerous charts.</p><p>A generator by itself doesn&apos;t lead to an edo; you need to have a generator which is a rational portion of the period and even then you don&apos;t necessarily get an edo.</p></div><h3><a id=92257 href="#92257">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/31/2010 7:20:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>genewardsmith wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, caleb morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; No one can talk any sense to me for the next little while, because I just tried 46EDO for the first time!

I<br/>think we&apos;re in agreement at this point.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The reason I picked the term &quot;temperament superclass&quot; is that<br/>&gt; &gt; superpyth and meantone are obviously very much perceptually related in<br/>&gt; &gt; a way that meantone and porcupine are not, which lends itself to a<br/>&gt; &gt; taxonomy whereby there is some larger concept of which meantone and<br/>&gt; &gt; superpyth are subcategories.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, but the relationship has nothing to do with their properties as temperaments, but rather, their properties as MOS scales. It is the case that a specific tuning for a rank-2 temperament can also be used to define an MOS scale, and that&apos;s probably why you&apos;re confused about the difference between the two. It&apos;s just that if you ONLY have the tuning for a temperament, and not its mapping, there&apos;s no way to say what temperament it actually is.</p><p>As per your definition above, superpyth and meantone do not have any<br/>specific properties as MOS scales, since they aren&apos;t tied down to a<br/>specific generator. Then again, by that same logic, you can&apos;t really<br/>say much about MOS scales either. The pajara MOS scales have a period<br/>of half an octave, but who&apos;s to say that that period isn&apos;t just a<br/>really detuned octave? And the LLsLLLs scales that we&apos;re used to -<br/>who&apos;s to say that the period shouldn&apos;t be a third of an octave, and<br/>the octave period isn&apos;t just a really sharp third-of-an-octave? Who&apos;s<br/>to say that 13-equal temperament isn&apos;t actually 12-equal with a really<br/>flat octave? If we aren&apos;t going to recognize &quot;common-sense&quot;<br/>delineations for the purposes of my example, then why recognize them<br/>anywhere?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Right, I understand very well that you could say that a meantone<br/>&gt; &gt; generator is 1199 cents and the period is 1200 cents. I&apos;m not dodging<br/>&gt; &gt; that point because I don&apos;t understand it, I&apos;m dodging it because I<br/>&gt; &gt; think we all have a decent &quot;common sense&quot; definition of what<br/>&gt; &gt; constitutes a meantone and what doesn&apos;t, and that rigorously defining<br/>&gt; &gt; it isn&apos;t necessary at this point to flesh out how temperaments fall<br/>&gt; &gt; into larger perceptual categories.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is our common-sense definition enough? Is 686 cents a meantone generator? Is 690 cents? If they are, then why isn&apos;t 703 cents? If they aren&apos;t, what are they? When you get away from TOP meantone (or some other optimized meantone), it becomes very difficult to say what is and isn&apos;t a meantone, even by common-sense definitions.</p><p>The idea to limit meantone to only the generators that produce 7+5<br/>scales seemed like a fairly rigorous way to express an intuitive<br/>common sense definition of it.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; But sure, you could certainly look at a list of optimal and near-optimal generators for different temperament classes and index them according to MOS families they belong to.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; aaaaaaa HAAAA! You admit it! :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Note the words &quot;optimal&quot; and &quot;near-optimal&quot;. You need to have specific tunings for each temperament before any such indexing is possible.</p><p>You could start with the TOP tuning. Or start with the TOP tuning, and<br/>then move to the nearest golden mean generator.</p><p>&gt; &gt; An idea I just had - perhaps that&apos;s one common sense way to delimit a<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament&apos;s range. So we could say that meantone is only meantone if<br/>&gt; &gt; the generator produces both 5+2 and 7+5 scales, (or equal variants<br/>&gt; &gt; thereof). This means that a lower bound for meantone is 7-tet,<br/>&gt; &gt; exclusive, and an upper bound for meantone is 12-tet, inclusive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why inclusive of 12-tET? 12-tET doesn&apos;t support either 5+7 or 7+5. If you&apos;re going to exclude 7, you should exclude 12, or else you should include both. But it doesn&apos;t make sense to say that 7-EDO is &quot;neither&quot; 5+2 nor 2+5 but that 12-tET is &quot;both&quot; 7+5 and 5+7.</p><p>Because 12-tet produces a 5+2 scale and a 12-note scale which can be<br/>viewed as a special case of 7+5. 7-tet produces a 7-note scale which<br/>can be viewed as a special case of 5+2, but no 12-note scale at all.</p><p>&gt; I went down this road a while back, though. I&apos;ll post a spreadsheet graphic I made where I listed the MOS families defined by branches on the Stern-Brocot tree, looking for patterns that would correlate to temperament classes. I too thought that we could define the range of a temperament class by MOS families of sufficiently-large size, and I too got very excited by this idea, thinking I&apos;d found the missing link between linear temperaments and MOS families. But after some probing of the list and some long meditation, I came to the conclusion that I had not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why did I conclude this? Because there are too many ways to invalidate the perceptual similarities on which the grouping is supposed to be based. Consider the problem that from 3\5-4\7, when you pass a certain point heading toward either end of the spectrum, the scale STOPS sounding like 5L+2s and starts sounding like 5-EDO or 7-EDO, so the perceptual grouping also stops making sense. I have not succeeded in finding that point.</p><p>That point will likely (as Rothenberg puts it) be listener-dependent<br/>and have to do with some listener-dependent tolerance factor. Harmonic<br/>Entropy is the same way, and the solution was to include a free &quot;s&quot;<br/>parameter to roughly estimate listener sensitivity. I don&apos;t think it<br/>kills the whole project though.</p><p>&gt; And as Herman suggested, and I keep trying to get through to you</p><p>In all honesty, Igs, I&apos;m getting tired of the patronizing. I am not an<br/>idiot, and my stance on things should be perfectly clear by now. The<br/>reason that I disagree with you that it&apos;s impossible to come up with a<br/>structure that relates temperaments and MOS families isn&apos;t that I<br/>don&apos;t understand the concept that temperament error is unbounded. It&apos;s<br/>that I&apos;m proposing a way to bound it, and you just keep telling me<br/>that temperament error is unbounded, so it&apos;s impossible.

Then I respond<br/>with a way to bound it...</p><p>&gt; temperament tunings vary in consistency across a given pitch-range. 690 cents is an inconsistent tuning for Meantone</p><p>How so? How is it &quot;just inconsistent?&quot; If I take any meantone<br/>generator that doesn&apos;t form a closed chain, a better approximation to<br/>5 will come up somewhere down the line than 4 generators, unless the<br/>generator is exactly that of 1/4-comma meantone. And a better<br/>approximation to 3 will come up somewhere down the line unless the<br/>generator is exactly 3/2.</p><p>&gt; equally as inconsistent as 709 cents is, in fact. From a perspective of both error and consistency, neither should be considered a meantone, yet 690 cents is squarely between 12-EDO and 7-EDO.</p><p>I am suggesting an alternate way to bound the meantone generator range<br/>besides the concept of consistency, because I have objections to it.<br/>The biggest objection I have is that any meantone, except for a few<br/>objections, is only consistent out to a finite number of generators.<br/>If we&apos;re going to limit things to going out a certain number of<br/>generators, then is that not a similar concept to limiting things to<br/>certain MOS&apos;s, which is equally as arbitrary?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Yes... I like this idea a lot :) Seems like it might lead to something<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting. I also wonder, just as you can specify a linear<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament by two ET&apos;s, what can you specify by two MOS&apos;s?

Any attempt at defining tuning ranges for temperaments beyond the &quot;optimum tuning&quot; is problematic.

The tree itself is a recurrent sequence:<br/>you start with the nodes 0/1, 1/1, and 1/0. The next nodes are 0+1/1+1 and<br/>1+1/1+0, i.e. 1/2 and 2/1, which can be read &quot;1 out of 2-EDO&quot; and &quot;2 out of<br/>1-EDO&quot; if we&apos;re dealing with scales of an octave period. Then you make the next<br/>branches as 1+1/2+1, 1+0/2+1, 2+1/1+1, and 2+1/1+0, or 2/3, 1/3, 3/2, and 3/1.<br/>At this point it should be clear that the nodes of a given level are defined as<br/>the classical mediants between the nodes of the previous level.</p><p>The important thing about the scale tree is that it is a visual representation<br/>of all possible MOS families.

One would have to define what a valid timbre is, but I have a suggestion.</p><p>Let us define a valid timbre as one whose ratios between two successive partials are always greater than the ratio between the following pair of partials. I admit I arrived at this definition partially intuitively and partially because of where it will take us, but does it not make sense that the distance between the third and fourth partials be greater than the distance between the fourth and fifth partials, and that the distance between the fourth and fifth partials be greater than the distance between the fifth and sixth? I could be talking gibberish, but if I&apos;m not then the constraint for a valid 5 limit timbre would be that 4/3&gt;5/4&gt;6/5. This statement is true from a generator of 685 cents to 720 cents, or from 5-edo to 7-edo. That is the same definition that keeps the diatonic scale (5L, 2s) valid.</p><p>Then a seven-limit timbre, which would introduce the temperament of the seventh partial and all its n octaves to (10,-3+n) could be defined as being valid where 6/5&gt;7/6&gt;8/7 is true. This would mean that the augmented second must remain smaller than the minor third, and that the diminished third must remain smaller than the augmented second. This is the case from a generator of 700 cents to 695, or from 12-edo to 19-edo, which is the location containing the (7L, 12s) scale is valid.</p><p>It appears that the MOS scales are *very tightly linked* to temperamental theory, when one accounts for the temperament of a timbre defined by comma sequence of a temperament. As one tempers away more comma&apos;s, one descends deeper into scale families (right?), and how each prime limit is tempered defines the commas which define over which generators the MOS scales will validate the timbre.<br/>If I were to follow the pattern, I&apos;d say that defining the 11-limit timbre would cut the remaining section of the syntonic temperament into an even smaller piece over which another more complex MOS would remain valid, but I apparently don&apos;t have to, because I just noticed on these diagrams from the TransformSynth:<br/><a href="http://img704.imageshack.us/f/continuac.png/">http://img704.imageshack.us/f/continuac.png/</a><br/>They already have the areas of generator sizes I&apos;ve been describing labeled (with the orange, red, and blue bars) according to the limit they support!</p><p>I think we can define things this way:<br/>5-limit meantone (tempering 81/80) is valid from 685 to 720, along with a corresponding MOS scale (diatonic: 5L, 2s).<br/>7-limit meantone (tempering 59049/57344) is valid from 695 to 700 along with an MOS (7L,12s).<br/>11-limit meantone (tempering 16777216/17537553) is valid from 695 to 697 along with a corresponding MOS scale.<br/>Etc, etc.</p><p>If different comma&apos;s were tempered out to give us 7 and 11 limit, we would end up with different subsets of the entire 5 limit Syntonic Temperament.</p><p>John Moriarty</p><p>Ps. Now think about making the Syntonic temperament lower limit, like three limit. This would require that 2/1&gt;3/2&gt;4/3 be true for a tempered timbre to be valid. This would be true from 600 cents to 1200 cents, wouldn&apos;t it?</p></div><h3><a id=92272 href="#92272">ðŸ”—</a>caleb morgan &#x3C;calebmrgn@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2010 5:53:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At the risk of eliciting howls of derision, I&apos;m admitting to experimenting with 46EDO with every fourth note removed, starting on 26.08 cents, for a total of 34 pitches.</p><p>I expect, though, that I will find I need those omitted pitches.</p><p>If this is &quot;Hitchcock&quot;, then maybe this subset is &quot;Psycho&quot;, or more ridiculous, &quot;Amityville Horror&quot;, or &quot;Shutter Island&quot;.</p><p>Seriously, if anyone is interested and can spot the most obvious problem with this subset beyond the fact that it doesn&apos;t allow equal playing in all keys, lemme know.</p><p>caleb</p><p>! 46et.scl &quot;Shutter Island&quot;<br/>46et ev-4th gone starting 26.08<br/>34<br/>!&#x9;&#x9;0<br/>52.17391 &#x9;1<br/>78.261&#x9;&#x9;2<br/>104.34&#x9;&#x9;3 b2<br/>156.52&#x9;&#x9;4<br/>182.609&#x9;&#x9;5<br/>!<br/>208.696&#x9;&#x9;6 2<br/>260.8696 &#x9;7<br/>286.9565&#x9;8 b3 narrow<br/>313.0435&#x9;9 b3 wide<br/>365.2174&#x9;10<br/>391.3043 &#x9;11 3<br/>!<br/>417.3913 &#x9;12<br/>469.5652&#x9;13<br/>495.6522&#x9;14 4<br/>521.7391 &#x9;15<br/>573.913 &#x9;16<br/>600&#x9;&#x9;17 #4/b5 middle-!tritone=<br/>!<br/>626.087&#x9;&#x9;18<br/>678.2609 &#x9;19<br/>704.3478&#x9;20 5&#x9;&#x9;!fifth=<br/>730.4348&#x9;21<br/>782.6087 &#x9;22<br/>808.6957 &#x9;23 b6<br/>!<br/>834.7826 &#x9;24<br/>886.9565 &#x9;25<br/>913.0435&#x9;26 6<br/>939.1304 &#x9;27<br/>991.3043 &#x9;28<br/>1017.391&#x9;29 b7<br/>!<br/>1043.478&#x9;30<br/>1095.652 &#x9;31 mj7<br/>1121.739&#x9;32<br/>1147.826 &#x9;33<br/>1200&#x9;&#x9;34</p><p>On Aug 31, 2010, at 10:20 PM, Herman Miller wrote:</p><p>&gt; genewardsmith wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, caleb morgan &lt;calebmrgn@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; No one can talk any sense to me for the next little while, because I just tried 46EDO for the first time!

I say that once you get past a certain generator size, the intervals produced by 4gen-2per and -3gen+2per no longer are no longer close enough to 5/4 and 6/5 (respectively) to be psychoacoustically identified as those ratios, so it no longer makes sense to call them that.  Then YOU say that we have to call them that, because this is the syntonic temperament and our generator is still a recognizable fifth, ergo 81/64 (four fifths minus two octaves) equals 5/4.  Then I say that maybe the syntonic temperament cannot be validly extended as far as you want it to, assuming musical intervals are considered to have psychoacoustic identities based on JI that are finite in size.  Then YOU say that psychoacoustics doesn&apos;t matter here, because we&apos;re talking about temperament and of course interval identities are going to get warped and conflated with one another.</p><p>The problem is that we&apos;re both insisting on contradictory ways to define intervals.  I think it makes the most sense to defined &quot;5/4&quot; according to some distance, harmonic-entropy-wise, from the cents-value of the 5/4 frequency ratio.  By definition, this places it between 4/3 and 6/5.  The way you&apos;re defining it for the syntonic temperament implies not just that a 5/4 can be ANYTHING so long as it is between the 4/3 and 6/5, but that in a near-by temperament like Father or Mavila, a 5/4 might actually be HIGHER in pitch than 4/3 (Father) or LOWER in pitch than 6/5 (Mavila).  If you&apos;re going to suggest this, then I really don&apos;t know what the point is of naming these intervals after JI frequency ratios.</p><p>A much BETTER way to define these inequalities that determine the bounds of the diatonic range, one that doesn&apos;t lead to psychoacoustic absurdity, is to use generator-period coordinates.  Instead of 4/3&gt;5/4&gt;6/5, you can use (-1gen+1per)&gt;(4gen-2per)&gt;(-3gen+2per).  In Father temperament, you get (4gen-2per)&gt;(-1gen+1per)&gt;(-3gen+2per), and in Mavila, you get (-1gen+1per)&gt;(-3gen+2per)&gt;(4gen-2per).  With these definitions, we don&apos;t even have to look at psychoacoustics, and to boot it&apos;s also the case that these inequalities can be SOLVED for either generator or period (or both, if you&apos;re crazy like that), so the inequality can actually be read as the formula that defines the family.</p><p>If you want to narrow down the family further, you can add other inequalities to the picture.  For instance, between 7-EDO and 12-EDO, an augmented 2nd (9gen-5per) is lower than a minor third, but from 12-EDO to 5-EDO, it is higher.  So you could specify what a lot of people call the &quot;meantone range&quot; by the inequality (-1gen+1per)&gt;(4gen-2per)&gt;(-3gen+2per)&gt;(9gen-5per), and the &quot;schismatic range&quot; as (-1gen+1per)&gt;(4gen-2per)&gt;(9gen-5per)&gt;(-3gen+2per).</p><p>We could also bring the diminished 3rd into it if we wanted, since you like defining 7-limit diatonics by relationship between minor 3rd, diminished 3rd, and augmented 2nd.  The diminished third is (-10gen+6per), so now we want the inequality to (-1gen+1per)&gt;(4gen-2per)&gt;(-3gen+2per)&gt;(9gen-5per)&gt;(-10gen+6per).  At 12-EDO, (-3gen+2per)=(9gen-5per), but both are &gt;(-10gen+6per).  At 19-EDO, (9gen-5per)=(-10gen+6per), but both are &lt;(-3gen+2per); so 19-EDO is the upper limit and 12-EDO the lower.  31-EDO is right smack in the middle, being the classical mediant, and the noble mediant--the &quot;Golden Meantone&quot;--is between 19-EDO and 31-EDO.  If you look at the Scale Tree, it&apos;s plain as day.</p><p>If I could find a quick and easy way of generating these inequalities for each level of the Scale Tree, I&apos;d be in hog-heaven.</p><p>&gt; Then a seven-limit timbre, which would introduce the temperament of the seventh<br/>&gt; partial and all its n octaves to (10,-3+n) could be defined as being valid where<br/>&gt; 6/5&gt;7/6&gt;8/7 is true.</p><p>Look at 22-EDO in terms of your inequalities.  In 22-EDO, 5/4&gt;7/6&gt;6/5&gt;9/8&gt;8/7...but that 5/4 is psychoacoustically 9/7 at 436.36 cents, the 7/6 is psychoacoustically 5/4 at 381.82 cents, the 6/5 is psychoacoustically 7/6 at 272.73 cents, and the 8/7 is psychacoustically about 16/15 at 109.09 cents.  Only the 9/8, at 218.18 cents, can reasonably be identified with an actual 9/8 frequency ratio.  22-EDO is in the range of the syntonic temperament, but defining its intervals in the way you propose makes a huge mess of their psychoacoustic identities.</p><p>&gt; It appears that the MOS scales are *very tightly linked* to temperamental theory, when<br/>&gt; one accounts for the temperament of a timbre defined by comma sequence of a<br/>&gt; temperament. As one tempers away more comma&apos;s, one descends deeper into scale<br/>&gt; families (right?), and how each prime limit is tempered defines the commas which define<br/>&gt; over which generators the MOS scales will validate the timbre.</p><p>Not just the commas, but also the error.  You can temper as many commas as you like, but if you allow for large error, the &quot;range&quot; will still remain wide.</p><p>&gt; If I were to follow the pattern, I&apos;d say that defining the 11-limit timbre would cut the<br/>&gt; remaining section of the syntonic temperament into an even smaller piece over which<br/>&gt; another more complex MOS would remain valid [snip]</p><p>It depends on how you define the 11-limit!  There are many, many ways to to define 11 in terms of 3, 5, and 7, if you&apos;re actually concerned about the 11th harmonic in your temperament sounding like the actual 11th harmonic.</p><p>&gt; If different comma&apos;s were tempered out to give us 7 and 11 limit, we would end up with &gt; different subsets of the entire 5 limit Syntonic Temperament.</p><p>Yes, exactly!</p><p>&gt; Ps. Now think about making the Syntonic temperament lower limit, like three limit. This &gt; would require that 2/1&gt;3/2&gt;4/3 be true for a tempered timbre to be valid. This would &gt; be true from 600 cents to 1200 cents, wouldn&apos;t it?</p><p>It would make no sense to call this Syntonic, because the syntonic comma is by definition 5-limit.</p><p>From a gen/per coordinate perspective, however, this does make sense: you&apos;d have (0gen+1per)&gt;(1gen+0per)&gt;(-1gen+1per).</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=92279 href="#92279">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2010 9:53:23 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;John Moriarty&quot; &lt;JlMoriart@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; These harmonic partial temperaments define the &quot;5-limit timbre&quot; for the syntonic temperament, and they can be derived from the pre-defined comma sequence.</p><p>What timbre?

Given timbre mapping, there is a goal: minimize sensory dissonance while retaining a timbre that has the recognizable function of a fully harmonic timbre.<br/>Though certainly not useless, a timbre of a snare drum playing a 4/5/6 major triad wouldn&apos;t do much for me, you know?</p><p>&gt; I say that once you get past a certain generator size, the intervals produced by 4gen-2per and -3gen+2per no longer are no longer close enough to 5/4 and 6/5 (respectively) to be psychoacoustically identified as those ratios, so it no longer makes sense to call them that.  Then YOU say that we have to call them that, because this is the syntonic temperament and our generator is still a recognizable fifth, ergo 81/64 (four fifths minus two octaves) equals 5/4.  Then I say that maybe the syntonic temperament cannot be validly extended as far as you want it to, assuming musical intervals are considered to have psychoacoustic identities based on JI that are finite in size.  Then YOU say that psychoacoustics doesn&apos;t matter here, because we&apos;re talking about temperament and of course interval identities are going to get warped and conflated with one another.<br/>&gt; The problem is that we&apos;re both insisting on contradictory ways to define intervals.  I think it makes the most sense to defined &quot;5/4&quot; according to some distance, harmonic-entropy-wise, from the cents-value of the 5/4 frequency ratio.  By definition, this places it between 4/3 and 6/5.  The way you&apos;re defining it for the syntonic temperament implies not just that a 5/4 can be ANYTHING so long as it is between the 4/3 and 6/5, but that in a near-by temperament like Father or Mavila, a 5/4 might actually be HIGHER in pitch than 4/3 (Father) or LOWER in pitch than 6/5 (Mavila).  If you&apos;re going to suggest this, then I really don&apos;t know what the point is of naming these intervals after JI frequency ratios.</p><p>It isn&apos;t that psychoacoustics doesn&apos;t matter anymore. It&apos;s that, given a tempered timbre who&apos;s fifth partial and it&apos;s octaves are mapped to coincide with that very &quot;inaccurate&quot; 5/4, that inaccurate 5/4 which is actually closer in ratio to 9/7 will still sound, harmonically, like a 5/4 psychoacoustically (because of the way the mapped timbres line up). The definition of just ratios is interesting, because you could define the interval 5/4 as you do, as an exact ratio, or you could define 5/4 as I do, as the ratio between the fifth and fourth partials, whatever they may be, and link it to the same perceptual/musical connotation that the exact 5/4 ratio gives when used with a fully harmonic timbre.</p><p>I suggest that it still makes sense to call an interval what it is defined as by the temperament even if it is closer to a different JI ratio because it will still sound perceptually like its defined function due to the tempered timbre.</p><p>&gt; This is another place the argument gets circular.</p><p>I know that on the surface this seems like circular logic. I define the timbre by the temperament, and then use the timbre to allow the temperament to function as I define it. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s circular, however. I think it is powerful, and consistent.</p><p>A friend of mine once countered the explanation for evolution by natural selection by defining it as circular logic:<br/>&quot;So only those that can survive will reproduce, and so then only those that reproduced have the kids that can survive? It&apos;s circular logic!&quot;</p><p>But I think one can pretty easily see that the theory of evolution does not use a false or circular logic. It just follows a logical progression where some propositions have conclusions that support other conclusions.</p><p>&gt;The way you&apos;re defining it for the syntonic temperament implies not just that a 5/4 can be ANYTHING so long as it is between the 4/3 and 6/5, but that in a near-by temperament like Father or Mavila, a 5/4 might actually be HIGHER in pitch than 4/3 (Father) or LOWER in pitch than 6/5 (Mavila).  If you&apos;re going to suggest this, then I really don&apos;t know what the point is of naming these intervals after JI frequency ratios.</p><p>They way I&apos;m defining it, it may work out that the interval supposed to function as a 5/4 will end up being larger than the exact ratio 4/3 in some other temperament (I don&apos;t know, I haven&apos;t checked), but I do know that the interval defined as 5/4 will never be larger than the interval defined as 4/3 in that temperament (because the functional range of a 5 limit temperament is where that temperament can define a harmonically functional timbre. That forces 4/3&gt;5/4&gt;6/5 to be true). And given the timbres defined by that temperament, I suggest that the interval defined as 5/4 will retain its function across that temperament, regardless of it&apos;s actual relation to the exact ratio 5/4, as long as the temperament is in a range where the defined timbre functions harmonically.

In 5-limit, harmonically functioning timbres function under this guideline:<br/>4/3&gt;5/4&gt;6/5<br/>That is, the ratio from the sixth to the fifth partial is never greater than the ratio between the fifth and the fourth, and the ratio between the fifth and fourth partial is never greater than the ratio between the fourth and third.<br/>Also, in syntonic/meantone, this can be defined as the range where the major third is not larger than the perfect fourth, nor is it smaller than the major third.<br/>In 7-Limit, harmonically functioning timbres function under this guideline:<br/>6/5&gt;7/6&gt;8/7<br/>Etc. etc.</p><p>John M</p></div><h3><a id=92288 href="#92288">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2010 4:49:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;John Moriarty&quot; &lt;JlMoriart@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Valid was a bad choice, so I&apos;ll say this.

Gongs, glockenspiels, gamelans, marimbas, vibraphones, and even pianos (to some extent) are not fully harmonic, i.e. do not meet your criteria.  And at any rate, your approach actually rules out all temperaments, so it&apos;s self-defeating.  See below a ways.</p><p>&gt; I know that on the surface this seems like circular logic. I define the timbre by the<br/>&gt; temperament, and then use the timbre to allow the temperament to function as I define<br/>&gt; it. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s circular, however. I think it is powerful, and consistent.</p><p>I&apos;m afraid it IS circular logic.  You said above that you define 5/4 as the ratio between the 4th and 5th partials, but you can&apos;t know what that ratio is until you first define the timbre.  To know the timbre, in your case, you need the temperament.  But to get the temperament, you have to know what 3/2 and 5/4 are.  But to know what those frequency ratios are, you need to look at the partials of the timbre.  IT&apos;S A CIRCLE.</p><p>&gt; They way I&apos;m defining it, it may work out that the interval supposed to function as a 5/4 &gt; will end up being larger than the exact ratio 4/3 in some other temperament (I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know, I haven&apos;t checked), but I do know that the interval defined as 5/4 will never be<br/>&gt; larger than the interval defined as 4/3 in that temperament (because the functional<br/>&gt; range of a 5 limit temperament is where that temperament can define a harmonically<br/>&gt; functional timbre. That forces 4/3&gt;5/4&gt;6/5 to be true). And given the timbres defined<br/>&gt; by that temperament, I suggest that the interval defined as 5/4 will retain its function<br/>&gt; across that temperament, regardless of it&apos;s actual relation to the exact ratio 5/4, as long &gt; as the temperament is in a range where the defined timbre functions harmonically. (That &gt; is, again, a location in the temperament where 4/3&gt;5/4&gt;6/5)</p><p>In &quot;Father&quot; temperament, 16/15 is tempered out, which means, among other things, 5/4=4/3 and 3/2=8/5.  Or, in your terms, the distance between the 3rd and 4th partials equals the distance between the 4th and 5th partials.  Gene doesn&apos;t like calling it a temperament because it has such high error, but it is a valid temperament nonetheless, and it would explicitly violate your conditions.</p><p>Similarly, if you temper out 25/24, you get 6/5 and 5/4 mapped to the same note, meaning the distance between the 4th and 5th partials should be different from the 5th and 6th partials.  Temper out 49/48, same thing happens with partials 6, 7, and 8.  And, for the clincher: in Meantone, the difference between 9/8 and 10/9 is tempered out, causing the same thing to happen with partials 8, 9, and 10.  So really, it&apos;s impossible to make a &quot;harmonically functional&quot; timbre out of a temperament, so far as I can tell, because at some point the ratio between two consecutive harmonics will NOT shrink.  And the more commas you temper, the more partials will end up in the same ratios.</p><p>&gt; Before, we had no objective way to define where exactly the error was too great, because &gt; deviation away from the just ratio of the generator was subjective, and the definition of &gt; MOS scales had no direct link to temperament. But now we can define the error as too<br/>&gt; great once a timbre defined by the temperament ceases to function harmonically.</p><p>I believe my above example handily disproves this.

At least I&apos;d hope.</p><p>&gt; But yes, the period has to be specified before you can group MOS&apos;s, which is why (when I&apos;m being rigorous), I give MOS&apos;s in the form &quot;nL+ms=period&quot; or &quot;nL+ms=x-EDO&quot;.</p><p>Fine. but if you&apos;re going to assume x-EDO, that assumes a pure octave.<br/>The octaves can be detuned and 2 can be mapped any way you&apos;d like,<br/>with an unlimited amount of error. The point is that you could say<br/>that 6-edo is just 12-edo with really stretched octaves. You could map<br/>things that way too.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And the LLsLLLs scales that we&apos;re used to -<br/>&gt; &gt; who&apos;s to say that the period shouldn&apos;t be a third of an octave, and<br/>&gt; &gt; the octave period isn&apos;t just a really sharp third-of-an-octave?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Because cents-values, unlike mappings, are non-arbitrary.</p><p>So you would say that LLsLLLs with a period of 1200 is a different<br/>scale than LLsLLLs with a period of 1199?

Yes. Rigorous? Not hardly.</p><p>It&apos;s no less rigorous than saying that it has to have a consistency of<br/>more than 12 or whatever.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You could start with the TOP tuning.

In one of my messages, I proposed that anything<br/>producing 5+2 scales be called an isotone, that anything producing 7+5<br/>scales be called a meantone (and anything producing 5+12 scales be<br/>called a superpyth). Then I pointed out that we can further subdivide<br/>it and that anything producing 12+7 scales be called a meantone (or a<br/>&quot;regular meantone&quot; if you prefer) and anything producing 7+12 scales<br/>be called an inframeantone, etc. I basically just stole these names<br/>from Margo and we can keep subdividing it as much as we want, and stop<br/>when it seems perceptually useless.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Because 12-tet produces a 5+2 scale and a 12-note scale which can be<br/>&gt; &gt; viewed as a special case of 7+5.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why? Why can it be viewed this way?</p><p>Because it can. Because I&apos;m creating a mathematical structure where it<br/>makes sense to view 12-et as a special case of 7+5. Because in one of<br/>your last emails, you SAID that equal temperaments are a special type<br/>of MOS. Because Kraig has also said this. Because existence is such<br/>that one can take this perspective. What is wrong with this? At this<br/>point it seems like you&apos;re just playing devil&apos;s advocate.</p><p>The point is that if we take as an axiom that ET&apos;s are a special case<br/>of MOS&apos;s, then 12-tet produces 5+2 and 7+5 scales. 7-tet only produces<br/>5+2 scales. There is a chromatic scale in 12-tet, and none in 7-tet.<br/>Whether you want to say that 12-tet is both a member of the 7+5 and<br/>5+7 MOS&apos;s, or neither, is really arbitrary and I don&apos;t care. It seems<br/>to make sense the first way, but whatever works works. But that would<br/>mean that ET&apos;s aren&apos;t a type of MOS.</p><p>&gt; &gt; That point will likely (as Rothenberg puts it) be listener-dependent<br/>&gt; &gt; and have to do with some listener-dependent tolerance factor. Harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; Entropy is the same way, and the solution was to include a free &quot;s&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; parameter to roughly estimate listener sensitivity. I don&apos;t think it<br/>&gt; &gt; kills the whole project though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t? How do you propose to get around it? The same way it&apos;s done in H.E.?</p><p>You could formulate, I suppose, a mathematical structure in which<br/>notes aren&apos;t represented with exact pitches, but represent a range of<br/>pitches that goes out by some listener tolerance epsilon in either<br/>direction. I&apos;m not sure exactly how the math would work, and it<br/>probably wouldn&apos;t have to do with discrete set theory anymore. Feel<br/>free to try and work it out, it&apos;s a little bit over my head. But I<br/>think if you read Rothenberg&apos;s stuff, you&apos;ll find he&apos;s basically<br/>worked a lot of it out already, and just dodged around the issue by<br/>noting that there&apos;d be this listener-dependent tolerance factor. I<br/>found that to be acceptable.</p><p>&gt; But your ways of bounding it are arbitrary and based on concepts unrelated to temperament.</p><p>What ways of bounding it aren&apos;t arbitrary? The human auditory system<br/>is arbitrary! Some concept of convention is going to have to come into<br/>it at some point, right? And even if we&apos;re going to go with<br/>consistency, why should that matter any more than what MOS scales are<br/>produced? It seems like the scales being produced are the more<br/>relevant category anyway, being as the point where the meantone<br/>generator really flips around your perception of things is when it<br/>gets flatter than 7-tet.</p><p>&gt; In your last post, you clearly demonstrated that you didn&apos;t know what a temperament actually *is*, at least as the term is used here.</p><p>Then I don&apos;t know how to demonstrate it any clearer. I understand that<br/>you can give meantone and porcupine and pajara all generators of 324<br/>cents and periods of 12931023 cents, and just map things out so that x<br/>amount of generators is viewed as being this prime and so on. What I&apos;m<br/>saying is that at this point, it&apos;s a little bit silly for you to start<br/>throwing at me this notion that my ideas lack mathematical rigor,<br/>because there is no math and no concrete ideas yet. They haven&apos;t been<br/>fully formed. I just posted them to get some discussion on how I COULD<br/>make them rigorous, since I think that they would be perceptually<br/>useful.</p><p>In fact, what I really was hoping was to find that this idea I was<br/>posing had already been worked out, and see how so. And it seems like<br/>a lot of it is territory that has been stumbled into before anyway. At<br/>this stage, admitting that &quot;common sense&quot; distinctions do exist and<br/>fleshing them out is probably key, and then working out retroactively<br/>what the rigorous pattern in the common sense was can come later.</p><p>&gt; Any attempt at defining tuning ranges for temperaments beyond the &quot;optimum tuning&quot; is problematic. Maybe this isn&apos;t an issue to you, and that as long as a generalization about a temperament is true often enough to be useful, the cases where it fails to be true are irrelevant. I&apos;m holding out for a higher standard of rigor, if I can find one, and I think we all should do the same. If we fail to find a more rigorous and complete taxonomic method, we can always come back and settle for any of the various incomplete possibilities.</p><p>Fair enough, but I still remain hopeful that there&apos;s some sort of<br/>brilliant million dollar idea that will tie it all together. We can,<br/>of course, still call meantone with a generator of 2380 cents and a<br/>period of 1234908102398102983 cents a meantone, but it seems prudent<br/>to simultaneously explore this other space, and perhaps see what<br/>connections this could lead to later on.</p><p>One idea I had was to make it work the other way - for any MOS, see<br/>which mappings would give the lowest badness. Hence 2+3 would give a<br/>few mappings with low badness (mavila, meantone, superpyth), and 5+2<br/>would give a few more (meantone, superpyth), and then 5+7 would best<br/>be mapped to superpyth and 7+5 best be mapped to meantone, and so on.<br/>This would have to be done within a certain limit. It&apos;s an interesting<br/>idea I&apos;m going to explore further, I think.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The biggest objection I have is that any meantone, except for a few<br/>&gt; &gt; objections, is only consistent out to a finite number of generators.<br/>&gt; &gt; If we&apos;re going to limit things to going out a certain number of<br/>&gt; &gt; generators, then is that not a similar concept to limiting things to<br/>&gt; &gt; certain MOS&apos;s, which is equally as arbitrary?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Right. It&apos;s all arbitrary. And it&apos;s all problematic. Should we really settle for boundaries that we know are inconsistent or problematic in some way? Is that really any more useful than not bothering to draw boundaries at all and just &quot;winging it&quot;? BTW, I&apos;m not being rhetorical with this question.</p><p>No, we shouldn&apos;t. But the problem is that music is, unfortunately,<br/>partially subjective, partially due to cognitive differences in<br/>listeners (as per Rothenberg&apos;s ideas about subjective maps), and<br/>partially due to how the auditory system is tweaked. We can use math<br/>to describe things, but not proscribe them. And in this case, we find<br/>that there is clearly some kind of cognitive or perceptual order to<br/>uncover when you plow into making some kind of scale taxonomy, and<br/>that the idea is sound on some level. Most importantly, it seems to<br/>reflect an organization of a subtle perceptual quality that I think<br/>deserves some looking into. Perhaps when we delve further into the<br/>taxonomy, we&apos;ll start to see patterns and then the rigor and<br/>overarching order will become clear. Perhaps not, and it&apos;ll be a red<br/>herring, similar to how the &quot;JI is the foundation for all of music&quot;<br/>idea was a red herring. Perhaps it&apos;s already been figured out.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=92291 href="#92291">ðŸ”—</a>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2010 7:02:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike Battaglia wrote:<br/>&gt; On Tue, Aug 31, 2010 at 9:53 PM, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; When the topic originally came up, I believe I was using &quot;consistency&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; as a shorthand for &quot;consistency range&quot; or &quot;consistency limit&quot;, something<br/>&gt;&gt; along those lines.

Or you&apos;re using the term &quot;temperament&quot; in the colloquial sense, rather than the more esoteric mathematical sense that gets used here.

When it comes to equal scales, they&apos;re either BOTH the MOS&apos;s that coincide at them, or they&apos;re neither, and we should be consistent, and I like the idea of them being both.  However, your comment about 7-EDO not being a case of it, I might disagree.  You don&apos;t HAVE to stop stacking generators once you hit a multiple of the period; for instance, in 12-tET, we have augmented 2nds and diminished 3rds, which seem to imply a more-than-12-note structure.  So you could say 12 has a 19-note and 31-note MOS too, it&apos;s just that a lot of notes end up being the same pitch.  Do you agree?</p><p>&gt; &gt; It doesn&apos;t? How do you propose to get around it? The same way it&apos;s done in H.E.?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You could formulate, I suppose, a mathematical structure in which<br/>&gt; notes aren&apos;t represented with exact pitches, but represent a range of<br/>&gt; pitches that goes out by some listener tolerance epsilon in either<br/>&gt; direction. I&apos;m not sure exactly how the math would work, and it<br/>&gt; probably wouldn&apos;t have to do with discrete set theory anymore. Feel<br/>&gt; free to try and work it out, it&apos;s a little bit over my head. But I<br/>&gt; think if you read Rothenberg&apos;s stuff, you&apos;ll find he&apos;s basically<br/>&gt; worked a lot of it out already, and just dodged around the issue by<br/>&gt; noting that there&apos;d be this listener-dependent tolerance factor. I<br/>&gt; found that to be acceptable.</p><p>Well, I suppose that&apos;s what we&apos;re stuck with.  It would be good to at least pin down a range or something.  Or I wonder if, instead of a range, we could limit it to a level on the Stern-Brocot tree?</p><p>The way I&apos;m skirting the issue in my EDO primer is just limiting my discussion to EDOs up to 37 (blame Andrew Heathwaite for getting me to stop there, I wanted to do up to 36 but he pushed me one greater).  If you&apos;re only dealing with EDOs, and only up to a certain number, then it&apos;s really a non-issue where you draw the line between what sounds more like 5L+2s and what sounds more like 5-EDO.  I mean, you have to get pretty high in the EDOs before you can get scales that really straddle the boundaries anyway, and there aren&apos;t any optimal temperaments near the boundaries either (in fact, they all seem to be pretty close the middle of whatever MOS family they are in).  So, yeah...I guess we can say &quot;boundaries schmoundaries&quot; and get on with our lives.</p><p>&gt; In fact, what I really was hoping was to find that this idea I was<br/>&gt; posing had already been worked out, and see how so. And it seems like<br/>&gt; a lot of it is territory that has been stumbled into before anyway. At<br/>&gt; this stage, admitting that &quot;common sense&quot; distinctions do exist and<br/>&gt; fleshing them out is probably key, and then working out retroactively<br/>&gt; what the rigorous pattern in the common sense was can come later.</p><p>And what I was trying to do was show you some of the cases that violate the &quot;common sense&quot; distinctions, or at least show that the &quot;common sense&quot; distinctions are hinting at something that is based neither on temperament nor MOS (or maybe on both, and something else to boot).  I&apos;m not arguing with you to be a jerk, Mike, I&apos;m just showing you all the problems I&apos;ve found when trying to pursue this same line of thought.  I&apos;m regurgitating to you stuff that was told to me when I asked similar questions.  I don&apos;t expect you to have answers to any of these questions.  When I raise an objection or ask you a question or tell you your usage of a term is inconsistent with the way I&apos;ve been told it&apos;s supposed to be used,  I&apos;m trying to be helpful.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Any attempt at defining tuning ranges for temperaments beyond the &quot;optimum tuning&quot; is problematic. Maybe this isn&apos;t an issue to you, and that as long as a generalization about a temperament is true often enough to be useful, the cases where it fails to be true are irrelevant. I&apos;m holding out for a higher standard of rigor, if I can find one, and I think we all should do the same. If we fail to find a more rigorous and complete taxonomic method, we can always come back and settle for any of the various incomplete possibilities.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; Fair enough, but I still remain hopeful that there&apos;s some sort of<br/>&gt; brilliant million dollar idea that will tie it all together. We can,<br/>&gt; of course, still call meantone with a generator of 2380 cents and a<br/>&gt; period of 1234908102398102983 cents a meantone, but it seems prudent<br/>&gt; to simultaneously explore this other space, and perhaps see what<br/>&gt; connections this could lead to later on.</p><p>I share the same hope.  I just don&apos;t think it will come from the theory of linear temperaments/the &quot;regular mapping paradigm&quot;.  It&apos;s not you I&apos;m trying to shoot down, it&apos;s the idea of temperament.  I think the pattern we&apos;re glimpsing will be better described by an as-yet undiscovered paradigm, and trying to relate MOS&apos;s back to Temperaments (and vice versa) is a dead end.  It&apos;s like quantum physics and relativity, or something.  They both work in different cases and point toward a &quot;grand unified theory&quot;, if we can but uncover it.</p><p>&gt; One idea I had was to make it work the other way - for any MOS, see<br/>&gt; which mappings would give the lowest badness. Hence 2+3 would give a<br/>&gt; few mappings with low badness (mavila, meantone, superpyth), and 5+2<br/>&gt; would give a few more (meantone, superpyth), and then 5+7 would best<br/>&gt; be mapped to superpyth and 7+5 best be mapped to meantone, and so on.<br/>&gt; This would have to be done within a certain limit. It&apos;s an interesting<br/>&gt; idea I&apos;m going to explore further, I think.</p><p>I will certainly be interested to see the correlation between billion-limit optimal generators and the &quot;golden generators&quot; on the scale tree, that&apos;s for sure!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Right. It&apos;s all arbitrary. And it&apos;s all problematic. Should we really settle for boundaries that we know are inconsistent or problematic in some way? Is that really any more useful than not bothering to draw boundaries at all and just &quot;winging it&quot;? BTW, I&apos;m not being rhetorical with this question.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, we shouldn&apos;t. But the problem is that music is, unfortunately,<br/>&gt; partially subjective, partially due to cognitive differences in<br/>&gt; listeners (as per Rothenberg&apos;s ideas about subjective maps), and<br/>&gt; partially due to how the auditory system is tweaked. We can use math<br/>&gt; to describe things, but not proscribe them. And in this case, we find<br/>&gt; that there is clearly some kind of cognitive or perceptual order to<br/>&gt; uncover when you plow into making some kind of scale taxonomy, and<br/>&gt; that the idea is sound on some level. Most importantly, it seems to<br/>&gt; reflect an organization of a subtle perceptual quality that I think<br/>&gt; deserves some looking into. Perhaps when we delve further into the<br/>&gt; taxonomy, we&apos;ll start to see patterns and then the rigor and<br/>&gt; overarching order will become clear. Perhaps not, and it&apos;ll be a red<br/>&gt; herring, similar to how the &quot;JI is the foundation for all of music&quot;<br/>&gt; idea was a red herring. Perhaps it&apos;s already been figured out.</p><p>I doubt it&apos;s already been figured out, or someone would have shut us by saying &quot;so-and-so published a paper on this years ago; congratulations you two douche-bags, you&apos;ve re-invented the wheel!&quot;</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=92295 href="#92295">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2010 11:06:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Thu, Sep 2, 2010 at 12:31 AM, cityoftheasleep<br/>&lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay Mike, let me stop picking nits. I think it would be a worthwhile endeavor to index the TOP generators for the multitudes of temperaments out there according to their MOS configurations. That way, it would be easy to find the harmonically-optimal tuning for all our favorite MOS scales, or find ways to transform between temperaments using common MOS scales as a bridge.</p><p>Damn those nits. But I think we&apos;re mostly in agreement now. I&apos;m only<br/>going to respond to the few parts of the first half of your message<br/>that I think are relevant to the actual work forward from here. If I<br/>don&apos;t respond to something, it can be assumed that I agree.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The octaves can be detuned and 2 can be mapped any way you&apos;d like,<br/>&gt; &gt; with an unlimited amount of error. The point is that you could say<br/>&gt; &gt; that 6-edo is just 12-edo with really stretched octaves. You could map<br/>&gt; &gt; things that way too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are we talking about temperaments or MOS here? There&apos;s no mapping involved in MOS scales. And this is why I have zero tolerance for deviating the period of MOS scales. But it is interesting to note how MOS&apos;s with the same shape but different periods occasionally may have similar properties.</p><p>I suppose it depends on how you define it. There are three ways to<br/>define an MOS (or scale) that I see:</p><p>1) A pattern of intervals, such as LLsLLLs, with no explicit period<br/>stated - such that LLsLLLs with a period of 1/5 of an octave, and<br/>LLsLLLs with a period of 1/2 of an octave, will count as &quot;the same<br/>MOS.&quot; Advantages: these two scales, admittedly, do have the same<br/>mathematical properties - if we&apos;re completely ignoring primes.<br/>Disadvantages: perceptually, these two scales couldn&apos;t be further<br/>apart.</p><p>2) A pattern of intervals, such as LLsLLLs, with an explicit period<br/>stated - such that LLsLLLs with a period of 1200 cents, and LLsLLLs<br/>with a period of 1199.999 cents, will count as two different MOS&apos;s.<br/>Advantages: solves the problem of when a detuned octave stops being a<br/>detuned octave by making them all different. Disadvantages: allows for<br/>the generator to be any size while locking the period down to just one<br/>size, which isn&apos;t cool. Also seems a bit impractical, since LLsLLLs<br/>could refer to an infinite number of MOS&apos;s.</p><p>3) A pattern of intervals and a &quot;pseudo-mapping&quot; for the period. That<br/>is, just like with regular temperament, you can map 2 to 300 cents, we<br/>take the same approach with MOS&apos;s. That means that LLsLLLs with a<br/>period of 1200 cents could be viewed as a diatonic MOS if you map the<br/>octave to 1200 cents, it could be viewed as a hemi-diatonic or<br/>whatever you&apos;d call it MOS if you map the &quot;half-octave&quot; to 1200 cents.<br/>Or the pajara scales could be looked at as 5-note MOS&apos;s if you map the<br/>octave to the 600 cent interval and just say it has really high error.<br/>Note that the period wouldn&apos;t have to be a rational number or even a<br/>division of the octave. Regular mapping would then be further applied<br/>later to warp things even more.</p><p>Advantages: solves the disadvantages of the above approaches.<br/>Disadvantages: finding it difficult to flesh out exactly how the<br/>mapping would work here.</p><p>I&apos;m attracted to either the first or third approaches. I think the<br/>first is best, since it only involves one mapping - this means all<br/>LLsLLLs scales become &quot;the same,&quot; whether it&apos;s got a period of a<br/>half-octave or not. This might make sense because it&apos;s really up to<br/>regular mapping anyway to decide how we interpret things - if we have<br/>a Pajara scale, which we define as ssLss with a period of 600 cents<br/>(symmetric pentachordal major), but we map things so that 2 is 600<br/>cents flat and thus has 600 cents of error, is it really Pajara<br/>anyway, at that point? If we&apos;re going to really assume the perspective<br/>that temperament error is unbounded, and if we&apos;re mapping 2 to 600<br/>cents, can we say that that&apos;s Pajara? Seems like it would be &quot;happy<br/>pentatonic&quot; at that point.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You don&apos;t have to stop. This is just another way to organize the<br/>&gt; &gt; generator space. In one of my messages, I proposed that anything<br/>&gt; &gt; producing 5+2 scales be called an isotone, that anything producing 7+5<br/>&gt; &gt; scales be called a meantone (and anything producing 5+12 scales be<br/>&gt; &gt; called a superpyth). Then I pointed out that we can further subdivide<br/>&gt; &gt; it and that anything producing 12+7 scales be called a meantone (or a<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;regular meantone&quot; if you prefer) and anything producing 7+12 scales<br/>&gt; &gt; be called an inframeantone, etc. I basically just stole these names<br/>&gt; &gt; from Margo and we can keep subdividing it as much as we want, and stop<br/>&gt; &gt; when it seems perceptually useless.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay, I think I finally get what you&apos;re trying to do. You&apos;re using &quot;Meantone&quot; not to refer specifically to the linear temperament called &quot;Meantone&quot; but to a category of MOS scales that bears some resemblance to the temperament. Or you&apos;re using the term &quot;temperament&quot; in the colloquial sense, rather than the more esoteric mathematical sense that gets used here. Man, stupid WORDS....</p><p>Right. And I think that what would happen, to tie this back into<br/>actual regular temperament theory, is that we could come up with some<br/>function to figure out the ideal mapping(s) for a certain MOS.</p><p>That is, find the generator range for a certain MOS - for LLsLLLs it&apos;s<br/>between 3/5 and 4/7. Although anything outside of that might still be<br/>&quot;mapped&quot; as meantone, it&apos;s definitely not going to be in that MOS<br/>family anymore.</p><p>Then we experiment with different mappings for that generator space.<br/>We figure out how it looks if use porcupine for it, meantone,<br/>schismatic, whatever. We come up with an expression to calculate the<br/>error relative to the meantone mapping for a generator of cents value<br/>xxx, then integrate it with respect to the cents value from 1200 * 4/7<br/>to 1200 * 3/5. Or something like that.</p><p>Then you sort them by how well they match, and voila, you have the<br/>best mappings for each MOS, which is about as rigorous a way as I can<br/>think of to start connecting MOS&apos;s to temperaments :)</p><p>&gt; Yes, a special type of MOS where L=s. But if you agree that 12 is also a special case of 5+7, then I&apos;m on board. When it comes to equal scales, they&apos;re either BOTH the MOS&apos;s that coincide at them, or they&apos;re neither, and we should be consistent, and I like the idea of them being both.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>&gt; However, your comment about 7-EDO not being a case of it, I might disagree. You don&apos;t HAVE to stop stacking generators once you hit a multiple of the period; for instance, in 12-tET, we have augmented 2nds and diminished 3rds, which seem to imply a more-than-12-note structure. So you could say 12 has a 19-note and 31-note MOS too, it&apos;s just that a lot of notes end up being the same pitch. Do you agree?</p><p>I see your point, but this is where I think it all gets a bit<br/>dangerous. It seems like if we can say that 7-EDO is a type of 7+5<br/>scale in which the &quot;s&quot; intervals are 0 cents - is the math more<br/>rigorous that way? If so I&apos;m for it. Perhaps Gene could weigh in.</p><p>I suppose my reasoning was that it&apos;s possible for you to literally<br/>hear 7-equal as a type of 5+2 scale, but not quite as possible for you<br/>to hear 5-equal as a type of 5+2 scale. Maybe I&apos;m wrong. Either way<br/>let&apos;s go with whatever makes the math more straightforward.</p><p>&gt; Well, I suppose that&apos;s what we&apos;re stuck with. It would be good to at least pin down a range or something.

But perhaps<br/>I&apos;m wrong. Either way, we are clearly using common sense to<br/>communicate perceptual borders that ARE rigorously defined, mentally.<br/>That is, our algorithm for processing this stuff is rigorously defined<br/>in our heads, for starters. I do agree that we need to be careful<br/>about not writing cultural biases into the theory (with a jazz<br/>background I am especially sensitive to common-practice &quot;rules&quot; that<br/>are really arbitrary).</p><p>I think that in this brave new world of music theory that this list<br/>has founded, what is really important is coming up with some kind of<br/>formal, rigorous mathematical foundation (regular mapping). However,<br/>what really interests me personally is to use mathematics to model and<br/>describe perceptual phenomena (harmonic entropy). The first is<br/>probably necessary to fully express ideas about the second one. The<br/>fact that MOS&apos;s (or more precisely, rank-order matrixes) really define<br/>something about where the instantation of a temperament perceptually<br/>&quot;shifts&quot; I think means that plowing into that side of things would be<br/>immensely useful.</p><p>I also think that exploring this side more fully and trying to connect<br/>it to regular mapping might be accomplished by applying some kind of<br/>psychoacoustic limits about what&apos;s &quot;valid,&quot; these limits being<br/>modelled by mathematics (harmonic entropy again).

And meditating on it and asking what it really means.</p><p>Note that the &quot;mood&quot; of the scale changes when the intonation does,<br/>but note also that something else about the scale stays &quot;the same.&quot;<br/>What exactly is it that&apos;s staying the same?

But what exactly is a &quot;function,&quot; anyway?<br/>It&apos;s definitely more than just V resolving to I, since you have chords<br/>like IV that don&apos;t necessitate any kind of resolution, they just have<br/>their own unique feeling or mood.</p><p>So you have one kind of mood coming from the ~JI intonation, and one<br/>kind of mood coming from the scale map.

Given timbre mapping, there is a goal: minimize<br/>&gt; &gt; sensory dissonance while retaining a timbre that has the recognizable function of a fully<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic timbre.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Though certainly not useless, a timbre of a snare drum playing a 4/5/6 major triad<br/>&gt; &gt; wouldn&apos;t do much for me, you know?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not all inharmonic timbres are &quot;noise&quot;.</p><p>I realize that, I was only trying to use the extreme as an example. The moment one breaks down the rules determining what allows a timbre to function harmonically, one approaches the extreme where the tendencies of harmony are likely to  not apply as consistantly. I am not trying to define what can *not* function musically. I understand that&apos;s how it looked, but I know that no one can do that. I do I think, however, you *can* define what is more likely to function musically, compared to other examples. For example, scales with only two steps sizes are more likely to function melodically than those with three. Those with three step sizes are more likely to function melodically than those with four. And harmonically related timbres are morel likely to function as a timbre with the possibility for recognizable harmony than those that are not related harmonically.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m afraid it IS circular logic.<br/>&gt; You said above that you define 5/4 as the ratio between the 4th and 5th partials, but you can&apos;t know what that ratio is until you first define the timbre.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>&gt; To know the timbre, in your case, you need the temperament.</p><p>Ok.</p><p>&gt; But to get the temperament, you have to know what 3/2 and 5/4 are.</p><p>No, to get the temperament I have to give cent values to the generators, or 3/2 and 2/1 (not 5/4), which will then determine both the tuning of the temperament and the tuning of the timbre. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s circular, is it?</p><p>&gt; In &quot;Father&quot; temperament, 16/15 is tempered out, which means, among other things, 5/4=4/3 and 3/2=8/5.  Or, in your terms, the distance between the 3rd and 4th partials equals the distance between the 4th and 5th partials.  Gene doesn&apos;t like calling it a temperament because it has such high error, but it is a valid temperament nonetheless, and it would explicitly violate your conditions.</p><p>If I knew how to make the greater-than-or-equal-to symbol, I would have been using it in all my examples. That is, in a 5-limit timbre defined by a 5-limit temperament, for that timbre to function harmonically it must follow that 4/3 [is greater than or equal to] 5/4 [is greater than or equal to] 6/5. This is why, given 5-limit meantone/syntonic, 7-edo and 5-edo we included instead of excluded. Now let&apos;s look at your example where 16/15 is tempered out:</p><p>5/4 becomes equal to 4/3, and 6/5 becomes equal to 9/8.<br/>Filling those values back into the inequality:<br/>4/3 [is greater than or equal to] 4/3 [is greater than or equal to] 9/8</p><p>It still works, it just so happens that the first part of the inequality will *always* be satisfied, and the timbre will only cease to function harmonically where 9/8 (or6/5)&gt;4/3.</p><p>&gt; Similarly, if you temper out 25/24, you get 6/5 and 5/4 mapped to the same note, meaning the distance between the 4th and 5th partials should be different from the 5th and 6th partials.  Temper out 49/48, same thing happens with partials 6, 7, and 8.  And, for the clincher: in Meantone, the difference between 9/8 and 10/9 is tempered out, causing the same thing to happen with partials 8, 9, and 10.  So really, it&apos;s impossible to make a &quot;harmonically functional&quot; timbre out of a temperament, so far as I can tell, because at some point the ratio between two consecutive harmonics will NOT shrink.  And the more commas you temper, the more partials will end up in the same ratios.</p><p>Next is your example where 25/24 is tempered out:<br/>5/4 becomes equal to 6/5<br/>Filling those values into the inequality:<br/>4/3 [is greater than or equal to] 5/4 [is greater than or equal to] 5/4</p><p>Once again, it still works. It just so happens that the second inequality is *always* satisfied, and the first one breaks down where 5/4&gt;4/3.</p><p>&gt; I believe my above example handily disproves this.

The moment one<br/>&gt; breaks down the rules determining what allows a timbre to function harmonically, one<br/>&gt; approaches the extreme where the tendencies of harmony are likely to  not apply as<br/>&gt; consistantly. I am not trying to define what can *not* function musically. I understand<br/>&gt; that&apos;s how it looked, but I know that no one can do that. I do I think, however, you *can*<br/>&gt; define what is more likely to function musically, compared to other examples.</p><p>If you can&apos;t define what *can&apos;t* function musically, what use is there in defining what *can*?  The point of defining a concept is to give it limits in what it can describe.</p><p>&gt; For example, scales with only two steps sizes are more likely to function melodically than &gt; those with three. Those with three step sizes are more likely to function melodically than &gt; those with four.</p><p>I take it you&apos;re not a fan of JI, then?  Some JI scales, like Centaur for instance, have WAY more than 4 step-sizes, and yet they seem to function just fine to my ears.</p><p>&gt; And harmonically related timbres are morel likely to function as a timbre<br/>&gt; with the possibility for recognizable harmony than those that are not related<br/>&gt; harmonically.</p><p>Perhaps that case could be made, but this way of looking at timbre still places a perfectly-harmonic timbre (i.e. one whose partials form a harmonic series) as the &quot;ideal&quot; of harmonic functionality, so detuning the partials to match the scale is going to push the timbre further from the ideal.  This effect is clearly audible to me in a lot of Sethares&apos; music, where timbres mapped to fit bizarre scales like 8-EDO or 13-EDO sound less harmonically-functional (and less pleasant, at least to my ears) than harmonic timbres playing the same scales.</p><p>And at any rate, I&apos;ve never found diatonic harmony in, e.g., 22-EDO to be any less recognizable than, e.g., 19-EDO harmony with timbre held constant, so I&apos;m not sure that the idea of tempering partials is really very necessary or even helpful.</p><p>&gt; No, to get the temperament I have to give cent values to the generators, or 3/2 and 2/1 &gt; (not 5/4), which will then determine both the tuning of the temperament and the tuning &gt; of the timbre. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s circular, is it?</p><p>It is if you maintain that JI ratios are defined as the ratios between partials in a timbre.  Are you now saying that 3/2 and 2/1 can be defined in some way that is unrelated to partials in a timbre?</p><p>Remember that we can stretch or compress the partials in a timbre as much as we want and still fulfill the condition that the ratios between successive partials decrease as we go up the series.  The 2nd and 3rd partial can be as close together or as far apart as we care to make them, suggesting that a 3/2 defined in this way can be of any size.</p><p>&gt; If I knew how to make the greater-than-or-equal-to symbol, I would have been using it &gt; in all my examples. That is, in a 5-limit timbre defined by a 5-limit temperament, for<br/>&gt; that timbre to function harmonically it must follow that 4/3 [is greater than or equal to] &gt; 5/4 [is greater than or equal to] 6/5. This is why, given 5-limit meantone/syntonic, 7-<br/>&gt; edo and 5-edo we included instead of excluded.</p><p>Well, that changes everything.  There is a world of difference between &quot;greater than&quot; and &quot;greater than or equal to&quot;.  There is an ascii character for it, but Yahoo usually butchers it, so I usually write &quot;&gt;/=&quot; or just &quot;greater than or equal to&quot;.</p><p>But if you allow for this, then you have to allow for a timbre in which all the partials are equally-spaced.  For something like a triangle wave, this is fine, since the ratio between partials is a maximally-consonant 2/1.  But what about a timbre where the ratio between any two successive partials is something like 18/17?  Or even 6/5?  Are you going to tell me, with a straight face, that timbres made like this are actually more harmonically-functional than a timbre where the ratios between successive partials increase as we go up the series?  You&apos;d clearly have to stipulate some minimum distance between partials</p><p>At any rate, I think it&apos;s nonsense to say that a frequency ratio--which is what 5/4 and 3/2 and 2/1 are, they are *ratios between two frequencies*, like 550 Hz:440 Hz--should be defined as ratios between ordinal partials in a timbre, rather between two fundamental frequencies.  I mean, you&apos;re basically suggesting that in a timbre where the 4th partial is 440 Hz and the 5th partial is 510 Hz, that we could say &quot;510:440 = 5:4&quot;.</p><p>An example of why this is problematic: say you have a timbre where the 4th and 5th partials are 440 and 510 Hz, respectively, and the rest of the partials all fit your criteria as stated above.  Now, you play two notes with this timbre: the first note is 110 Hz, and the 2nd note is 137.5 Hz.  You&apos;ve defined 5/4 as being 510/440, so what do you call 137.5/110?</p><p>As I said above, there&apos;s no limit to how far apart or close together we can space the partials in a timbre, effectively meaning that there is no boundary to the size of the ratios between them.  So we could say 4:5 = 200:201, or we could say it equals 200:276394, presuming the rest of the partials are sized so that the ratios between them decrease as we go up the series.</p><p>Furthermore, in order for temperament to make sense at all, we have to be able to define a JI map that is absolute, which we can then use temperament to warp.  But you are basically suggesting that we define JI *according to a temperament*.  If we defined JI as being the pitch-space defined by the map of Meantone temperament, for example, there is no such thing as the syntonic comma.  Since we are no longer allowing for existence of an absolute JI map, &quot;temperaments&quot; as we know it cease to exist, and we can only define different pitch-space maps in relation to each other.  At this point, it would be impossible to use frequency ratios in a meaningful way, unless we specified the timbre before hand.  And this would mean that a 3/2 on a clarinet would be different than a 3/2 on a flute, and we&apos;d have to do timbral analysis of every instrument we wanted to use before we could even describe a scale on it.</p><p>Ludicrous, John.  Ludicrous.  You don&apos;t want to open the Pandora&apos;s box of letting frequency ratios be flexibly defined.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=92300 href="#92300">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/2/2010 6:46:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Perhaps that case could be made, but this way of looking at timbre still places a perfectly-harmonic timbre (i.e. one whose partials form a harmonic series) as the &quot;ideal&quot; of harmonic functionality, so detuning the partials to match the scale is going to push the timbre further from the ideal.

I think we understood that the C is the tonic and we want all 8 tones without a heavy hierarchy, otherwise the scale is hardly challenging, for you could just take it as c# minor/harmonic minor for example). And we wanted 7-limit. So, either 7/5 or 10/7 (its merely a question as to which voicing you&apos;re going to tend toward as to which one is more concordant in practice, of course).  The aug2/M3 ( or m3/dim4, 12-tET letting us choose) combo is obviously important, so I went for 7/6 and 5/4, which both sound great and contrast with each other. The m2/supertonic I gave to 7, so, 21/20 (4/3 below 7/5). The lower hemioctachord kind of writes itself. The upper hemioctachord though raises the question of tempering. Should the aug5/m6 belong to 7 (14/9, 4/3 above 7/6) or to 5 (25/16, two 5-limit M3s)? Should the M7 belong to 5 (15/8) or to 7 (28/15, 4/3 above 7/5)? These choices lie very close to each other, less than 8 cents apart, 225/224 to be exact, quite good natural puns. So I just tempered out 225/224 by using 41 equal divisions of the octave. I guess that means the temperament would be called &quot;miracle&quot; here.</p><p>The complement of this scale, in 12-tone set theory jargon, is the material of a Gm7 chord. Its a very nice place to go I think, there&apos;s a few moments of G dorian toward the end there, with 7/4 as the 7-limit minor third and G,D,F Pythagorean from the C (the rest of the dorian scale/13th chord is an intersection with the first set, in set-speak, shared tones in normal human lingo :-) ) I didn&apos;t comma-adjust anything by using a step of 41 in this piece, no need, but I would do so for various different modulations. The resulting scale I used turned out to almost identical to Kraig&apos;s Centaur scale, which was fun (I did Compare Scale in Scala), in fact it&apos;s the same as Centaur with 225/224 tempered out via 41-edo. For some stuff that comes to ear, as far as this piece, I&apos;d need a few more tones, about 16 tones altogether, in order to shift some wolves.

So if do they appear it is not an accident.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Using a scale of such augmented/diminished nature, C,C#,Eb,E,F#,G#,A,B,C in 12-speak, I think it&apos;s dandy to be able to vary and choose between augmented sonorities like 5/4+5/4 and 5/4+81/64, etc., and to use seven-limit. D#/Eb here is 7/6, F# is 7/5 for example, all intervals are very close to pure, as you can hear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And 81/80 is not tempered out. Not tempering out 81/80 is like the first fundamental step of &quot;detwelvulating&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Cameron,<br/>&gt; I just listened to the file. I really like what you did with it - how<br/>&gt; did you intone things? Did you use a linear temperament, or stick with<br/>&gt; marvel as a planar tuning? Or did you just tune it by ear without<br/>&gt; following any specific methodology?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=92905 href="#92905">ðŸ”—</a>John Moriarty &#x3C;JlMoriart@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/16/2010 5:33:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry to rehash this after it&apos;s been gone for so long, it just took me a while to get to everything.</p><p>&gt; If you can&apos;t define what *can&apos;t* function musically, what use is there in defining what *can*?  The point of defining a concept is to give it limits in what it can describe.</p><p>Again, I&apos;m not even defining what can or can&apos;t at all. I&apos;m defining what is more likely to function than something else. Music, obviously, is partial subjective, and partial cognitive/mathematical/what have you. What I&apos;m trying to say is you can&apos;t define what is or isn&apos;t musically functional because to someone a rainforest ambient track might be music. But I think you can determine that a 4/5/6 triad played by three trombones is *more likely* to be interpreted as &quot;musical&quot; than the sound of a car crash.</p><p>&gt; &gt; For example, scales with only two steps sizes are more likely to function melodically than &gt; those with three. Those with three step sizes are more likely to function melodically than &gt; those with four.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I take it you&apos;re not a fan of JI, then?  Some JI scales, like Centaur for instance, have WAY more than 4 step-sizes, and yet they seem to function just fine to my ears.</p><p>I love myself some good JI. But have you noticed that so many JI scales imitate MOS scales, specifically the diatonic scale? Melodic stability is usually just as important in designing scales as harmonic stability, and just diatonic scales are *approximating* the diatonic scale, a scale with two *perceptual* step sizes.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And harmonically related timbres are morel likely to function as a timbre<br/>&gt; &gt; with the possibility for recognizable harmony than those that are not related<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonically.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps that case could be made, but this way of looking at timbre still places a perfectly-harmonic timbre (i.e. one whose partials form a harmonic series) as the &quot;ideal&quot; of harmonic functionality, so detuning the partials to match the scale is going to push the timbre further from the ideal.  This effect is clearly audible to me in a lot of Sethares&apos; music, where timbres mapped to fit bizarre scales like 8-EDO or 13-EDO sound less harmonically-functional (and less pleasant, at least to my ears) than harmonic timbres playing the same scales.</p><p>Absolutely. Similar to the way tempering just ratios to fit melodic purposes and transposition has its payoffs and downturns, so does the tempering of a timbre. You might end up with a dirty sounding timbre with consonant triads, as opposed to a pure tone with triads that make you cringe. Sometimes I prefer one to the other, and sometimes it&apos;s switched.</p><p>&gt; &gt; No, to get the temperament I have to give cent values to the generators, or 3/2 and 2/1 &gt; (not 5/4), which will then determine both the tuning of the temperament and the tuning &gt; of the timbre. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s circular, is it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is if you maintain that JI ratios are defined as the ratios between partials in a timbre.  Are you now saying that 3/2 and 2/1 can be defined in some way that is unrelated to partials in a timbre?</p><p>Before I said something along the lines of:<br/>I define 3/2 as the interval between the second and third partials, regardless of what they may be.</p><p>To put it simply, I shouldn&apos;t have said that. It is too general to fit what I meant, and I think it&apos;s gotten me into trouble (x_X)</p><p>I mean to say that just intervals (like 3/2) are a &quot;perceptual identity&quot; or &quot;function&quot; represented by the musical connotation of the interval between the second and third partial of a harmonic timbre. We can&apos;t define over which values of cents the human race as a whole will still perceive this identity, but we can define over which values of cents it makes sense to define a just interval when we are defining other just intervals in terms of it.</p><p>It makes sense to define a just interval in terms of others (defining 5/4 in a stack of fifths and octaves) only when you can still sensibly relate each back to the perceptual identity&apos;s representation in the harmonic series. If you define 5/4 as (3/2)^4 * (2/1)^-2, then 4/3 &gt;= 5/4 &gt;= 6/5 when 686&lt;3/2&lt;720, and this important because, when relating it back to the harmonic series and it&apos;s functions, the function of 5/4 is not smaller than that of a 6/5, and the function of a 4/3 is not smaller than that of a 5/4.<br/>Think about a major triad. Where 6/5&gt;5/4, won&apos;t 10:12:15 be major, and 4:5:6 be minor? But we define 4:5:6 as the function of a major triad, and it only stays major above a fifth of 786 cents.<br/>Similarly, above 720 cents, the 4:5:6 triad will overlap with 3:4:5, and this will make the definition of the 4:5:6 as a major triad irrelevant, so we don&apos;t go above 720.</p><p>Now, I realize this reasoning is slightly different than the angle I&apos;ve been taking about mapping a timbres&apos; partials, but I think they revolve around the same central idea. It is perceptually meaningful to, when tempering just ratios, not allow for a/b&lt;b/c&gt;c/dÂ… when a&lt;b, b&lt;c, and c&lt;d, because of the way one can define harmonic function by just ratios&apos; relationships to the functions of the intervals between harmonic partials. Tempering the timbre or not.</p><p>&gt; Remember that we can stretch or compress the partials in a timbre as much as we want and still fulfill the condition that the ratios between successive partials decrease as we go up the series.  The 2nd and 3rd partial can be as close together or as far apart as we care to make them, suggesting that a 3/2 defined in this way can be of any size.</p><p>That is a good point, and one I&apos;ve struggled with before. What if you set 2/1 = 400 cents? Right now, I don&apos;t know.<br/>Before we had an issue of which generators are those over which we should define a temperament. We couldn&apos;t just say, &quot;A 3/2 stops being a 3/2 rightÂ…. Here!&quot;, and the same is true for the period (which is what would cause the compression). Obviously right now I&apos;m proposing an objective way to define generator ranges, but as far as the period is concerned I don&apos;t know if there is an objective way to define a range.<br/>I would suggest, however, that given that extremely stretched or compressed temperament of the timbre, it would still be more likely to function harmonically if it fits those conditions than if it didn&apos;t. I don&apos;t have many example of this recorded, but I&apos;ll have to work up a few and put them on the list. I&apos;ve heard some pretty extreme stretching (2/1=1300 cents for instance), and it can still function very recognizably as meantone, with mapped timbres.</p><p>&gt; But if you allow for this, then you have to allow for a timbre in which all the partials are equally-spaced.</p><p>That&apos;s correct, that would be a temperament where 2/1=3/2=4/3 etc. A very very low accuracy temperament mind you (where 4/3=1!), but still a temperament which could define a (very low accuracy) timbre that would most allow for the temperament&apos;s definitions to funciton. 4/3 would be most likely to be interpreted as 1/1 given a timbre of equally spaced partials.</p><p>&gt; For something like a triangle wave, this is fine, since the ratio between partials is a maximally-consonant 2/1.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand this. Doesn&apos;t a triangle wave simply contain odd harmonics? f, 3f, 5f, etc as opposed to f, 2f, 4f, 8f which it seems like what it is you are describing.</p><p>&gt; But what about a timbre where the ratio between any two successive partials is something like 18/17?  Or even 6/5?  Are you going to tell me, with a straight face, that timbres made like this are actually more harmonically-functional than a timbre where the ratios between successive partials increase as we go up the series?  You&apos;d clearly have to stipulate some minimum distance between partials.</p><p>Given that you are using the temperament where 2/1=3/2=4/3 etc, and you assign 2/1=something like 215 cents, then I suggest that though it may be a HUGELY inaccurate temperament, a timbre defined by this temperament would be mostly likely to function as the temperament describes, with that given period size. How desirable that would be for me, I don&apos;t know, but I&apos;m not the one asking for such a low accuracy temperament with such a mangled period! =P</p><p>&gt; As I said above, there&apos;s no limit to how far apart or close together we can space the partials in a timbre, effectively meaning that there is no boundary to the size of the ratios between them.  So we could say 4:5 = 200:201, or we could say it equals 200:276394, presuming the rest of the partials are sized so that the ratios between them decrease as we go up the series.</p><p>Yes. Again, a very low accuracy temperament with an extremely tempered period, but given that one would expect a very low accuracy timbre.</p><p>&gt; Furthermore, in order for temperament to make sense at all, we have to be able to define a JI map that is absolute, which we can then use temperament to warp.  But you are basically suggesting that we define JI *according to a temperament*.</p><p>Again, I was overzealous in saying that &quot;5/4 is the relationship between the fifth and fourth partials, whatever that may be&quot;. I think I&apos;ve addressed that above.</p><p>John M</p></div>
