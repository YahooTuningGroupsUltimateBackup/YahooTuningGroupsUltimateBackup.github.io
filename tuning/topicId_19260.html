And of course, all other comments<br/>are welcome as well.</p><p>=====================================================================</p><p>Adaptive tuning (also called dynamic tuning) is the process of modifying<br/>the tuning of pitches as a piece is played, to best suit the intervals<br/>and chords at each moment.</p><p>There are many types of adaptive tuning:</p><p>   . Discrete Adaptive Tuning (DAT), also called Fixed Adaptive Tuning<br/>     (FAT) vs. Continuous Adaptive Tuning (CAT), also called Variable<br/>     Adaptive Tuning (VAT).</p><p>   . Method of making tuning choices: performer vs. computer program.</p><p>   . Real-time adaptive tuning vs. &quot;leisure&quot; tuning, with the latter<br/>     able to make choices based on an entire work, and the former able<br/>     to see only the past and present.</p><p>DAT/FAT achieves adaptive tuning by making dynamic use of a fixed set of<br/>available pitches, almost always on a keyboard instrument.  The number<br/>of possible pitches is determined by the number of physical keys<br/>available to the player.  This has the advantage of giving the artist<br/>complete control over the adaptive tuning used, at the expense of<br/>limiting to some extent the range of what can be done.</p><p>A practical method for DAT/FAT was first proposed by Nicoli Vicentino in<br/>1555.  One keyboard manual is tuned in 1/4 comma meantone, or actually<br/>the almost identical 31-tET; the other corrects for the flat fifths by<br/>being tuned 1/4 comma higher.</p><p>CAT/VAT can be produced by some acoustic instruments, and by the human<br/>voice, and by electronic instruments.  Barbershop singing makes heavy<br/>use of CAT/VAT, and to some extent, so do jazz and blues singing and<br/>playing.  More recently, there have been experiments with retuning<br/>programs that apply CAT/VAT to MIDI files.</p><p>The challenges of adaptive tuning are easily illustrated: consider the<br/>sequence C-&gt;A-&gt;D-&gt;G-&gt;C, either with bare notes or with the chords Cmaj,<br/>Amin, Dmaj, Gmaj, Cmaj.  The ideal tunings for the four sequential<br/>intervals are 5:6, 4:3, 4:3, 4:3, but the product of these, corrected<br/>for octave, is 80:81, the famous (or infamous) syntonic comma.  One way<br/>to deal with this challenge is to let the absolute tuning &quot;drift&quot; over<br/>time, in this case downward by about 1/5 semitone each time the sequence<br/>is played.  Over the course of a reasonably long piece, drift of this<br/>sort can easily amount to a large fraction of an octave, if not more.<br/>There is a school that accepts such drift in order never to compromise<br/>simultaneous intervals or retune sounding notes.  If drift is considered<br/>unacceptable, however, then difficult choices have to be made, both in<br/>modifying the tuning of notes which are continuously sounding, and in<br/>compromising to some extent the tuning of intervals.</p><p>Real-time adaptive tuning by program is superior to leisure tuning in<br/>that one need not wait for the results: as a piece is played, it is<br/>tuned.  However, since chord transitions often involve a few<br/>milliseconds of overlap, a real-time program can easily become confused<br/>and make bad choices that have to be corrected with painful motion of<br/>notes already sounding.  These challenges are particularly intense when<br/>tuning targets 7 or higher limits, in which tuning deviations are much<br/>greater than in 5-limit music.</p><p>At least one commercial program is available for real-time CAT/VAT,<br/>and at least one list member has dabbled in leisure retuning of MIDI<br/>files.  The field of adaptive tuning is still in its infancy, however,<br/>and many refinements have yet to be made.  Also, there is a great deal<br/>of controversy regarding what target adaptive tunings (if any) are<br/>suitable, or appropriate, for works of past masters.</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2001 6:29:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oops!

I&apos;d prefer that someone who<br/>uses strict JI decide that, but, for the moment, I&apos;ve included the drift<br/>option under the adaptive tuning umbrella.</p><p>What I&apos;m trying to illustrate with the comma-pump sequence is that<br/>SOMETHING has to give.  I do explicitly mention drift as an option, but<br/>perhaps I need to say more clearly that the alternative, the retuning<br/>of existing notes, is painful?
