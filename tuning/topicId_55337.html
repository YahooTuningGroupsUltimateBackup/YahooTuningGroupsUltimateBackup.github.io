Scala calls this a<br/>&quot;major chroma&quot; or &quot;major limma&quot;.</p><p>Monz doesn&apos;t give this definition, but instead offers that &quot;chroma&quot;<br/>is a synonym for octave-equivalent pitch class.  What&apos;s your source<br/>on that, Joe?</p><p>Monz also quotes Chalmers as saying  that it&apos;s &quot;the genus with<br/>a minor third and two semitones&quot;, which is aka Chromatikon.</p><p>He finally suggests that Gene won&apos;t use it to mean chromatic uv<br/>after August 2004.</p><p>I rather like the term.  It&apos;s its own plural.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
