I don&apos;t think ACEF work as well though...though A C and F have a common denominator of 3 E (5/4) does not seem to.<br/>  Although at least in this case (unlike DFA) most of the notes in the chord aim toward a single common denominator/u-tonal relationship...and it sounds consonant to me though not as consonant as BCEF.</p><p>   A weird coincidence in the arithmetic mean scale is the chord<br/>E F# G A where every single tone shares a common denominator except F#.

So I didn&apos;t need your hi math formula :-) And I don&apos;t think I was the first composer using this principle, despite the fact<br/>I&apos;m not aware about any work of 20th century music using similar<br/>system. Anyway it&apos;s nothing special, just a way how to organize basic<br/>material for composition. Then I have worked with it in a modal,<br/>serial or intervallic way. Such scales are only a fraction of my<br/>compositional language.</p><p>A) Concerning scales made from such chains, there&apos;s an unlimited<br/>number of them. For me it was enough to find how to create them. When<br/>I will need some, it can be easily done. Any interval can be used<br/>which allows those &quot;shifts&quot; thru standard octave terrain, be it pure<br/>or tempered, or microtonal. In the case of 12 ET the smallest<br/>interval should be fourth, then scales can be constructed from<br/>tetrachords (another field of my interest).<br/>I was mainly interested in those scales which avoid octave interval<br/>(for example tetrachordal structure 131 - C Db E F Gb A Bb Cb D Eb Fb<br/>G Ab... - first octave step C is missing). Anyway when octave is<br/>there, it&apos;s often a different &quot;grade&quot; in the chain period, and it can<br/>be used intentionally to confuse listeners and hide real periodicity<br/>blocks.</p><p>Fourth-ave and fifth-ave are the most usable as they go through all<br/>circle and the resulting scales have big range. That&apos;s good for<br/>piano, organ, orchestral music. Interval 10 halftones allows to<br/>create scale with 5 octaves span. Interval 9 creates three octaves<br/>scale (root notes of 4 periods create diminished seventh chord), 8<br/>goes to 2 octaves (root notes of 3 periods create augmented chord).<br/>Of course only in the case that last tone of one period is the first<br/>tone of the next period. There&apos;s always possibility to have bridge<br/>interval.</p><p>I like a combination of modal and serial principles, so I focused<br/>mainly on scales which use all 12 tones. And it&apos;s like to find a<br/>small treasure when some mathematically beautiful scale is<br/>discovered, combining modal chains with 12tone serialism, avoiding<br/>normal octave in its internal structure, and additionally having some<br/>more features like symmetry, and musically interesting subsets as<br/>well. For example this one:</p><p>C-Db-Eb-Gb-Ab-A-B-D-E-F-G-Bb-(C)</p><p>Period is 8 halftones, no bridge interval, so &quot;root&quot; notes of periods<br/>are C, Ab, E, and after two standard octaves whole scale is repeated.<br/>And period intervallic structure is 1232, three times repeated. We<br/>can find pentatonic cells 232, major/minor chords 353, quartal chord<br/>555, all 12 dominant seventh chords, diminished chords, minor<br/>tetrachords, tritone relations, symmetric chords like 35153, 35353,<br/>35653, 52125, 53235, 53535, 53735,  55355, 2533352, 2353532...</p><p>Principle can be easily used also for scales with periodicity block<br/>bigger than octave. For me personally these scales are more<br/>interesting, especially when they are constructed in such a way they<br/>avoid standard octave step and have different tones in higher range<br/>(behind octave). It&apos;s more easy to create 12tone series and get a<br/>synthesis of modal and serial principles. I like to make it even more<br/>interesting and work with intervallic method in composition.<br/>One of possible scales with period 14 halftones, &quot;serpent-like&quot;<br/>intervallic structure 14131211, no bridge interval between period,<br/>with span of 7 standard octaves:<br/>C-Db-F-Gb-A-Bb-C-Db-D-Eb-G-Ab-B-C-D-Eb-E-F-A-Bb-Db-D-E-F-F#-G-B-C-D#-<br/>E-F#-G-G#-A-C#-D-F-F#-G#-A-A#-B-D#-E-F-G#-A-B-(C)</p><p>As you can see this scale has often starting C in higher octaves<br/>which can be again emphasized in composition.<br/>To make this scale more interesting, every second period can have<br/>inverted structure 11213141.</p><p>When I think more far in this direction, it&apos;s possible to make scales<br/>using different pattern in every period. For example chained scale<br/>constructed from tetrachords - every tetrachord can  have different<br/>internal structure. As I have 20 different tetrachords in my<br/>tetrachordal system, there&apos;s a lot of combinations possible, and when<br/>bridge interval between tetrachords comes into the game, even more.<br/>To make it more beautiful it&apos;s again possible to work with<br/>intervallic structure of tetrachords, and order them symmetrically<br/>for example.</p><p>B) I have no idea if somebody worked with similar scales.</p><p>C) On standard piano keyboard there&apos;s no difference between E# and F,<br/>but in music theory is. To ignore enharmonic changes looks, hm, how<br/>to say politely....<br/>You have used diatonic pattern 2-2-2-1, major-major-major-minor<br/>second, so you have to keep this intervallic structure in transpositions as well. Starting on B it must be B-C#-D#-E#-F#. By<br/>using F you destroy intervallic structure, because D#-F is diminished<br/>third, and F-F# augmented prime (chromatic halftone, not diatonic).<br/>[If you want to use F, you must enharmonically change the other notes<br/>as well to get result Cb-Db-Eb-F-Gb, which is also OK.]<br/>Therefore starting on F# it should be F#-G#-A#-B#-C#, on C# - C#-D#-<br/>E#-Fx-G# etc.</p><p>H# is just my mistake, as my native language (plus German and more<br/>others) differentiates between B and H, B is English Bb, H is B.<br/>Therefore I could compose some works on acronym B-A-C-H, or H-A-B-A,<br/>Schumann could use a German name of Czech city A&scaron; (A-S-C-H) and<br/>Gustav Holst started Uranus in Planets with his own signature (G-(u)S-<br/>(t)A-(v)-H-(olst)).

It&apos;s only one of basic rules of music theory, part of<br/>enharmony. On the piano D#-F sound same as Eb-F, D#-E#, Eb-E#, Eb-Gbb<br/>or D#-Gbb, but size of interval is different (with one exception in<br/>these examples):<br/>D#-F and Eb-Gbb are diminished thirds (derived from basic shapes in<br/>the standard notation D-F and E-G, that means without accidentals)<br/>Eb-F and D#-E# are major seconds (derived from E-F and D-E)<br/>Eb-E# is double augmented prime (derived from E-E)<br/>D#-Gbb is triple diminished fourth (derived from D-G)<br/>That&apos;s all.</p><p>Daniel Forr&oacute;</p></div><h3><a id=83700 href="#83700">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/19/2009 11:54:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel&gt;&quot;That was only joke from my side...&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I figured on that, hence the :-D emoticon. :-)</p><p>&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t believe much in universal theories of all, universal means</p><p>also uniform. I prefer diversity.&quot;<br/>&nbsp; Hmm...the way I think of it is of one theory that can be used in many different ways.&nbsp; I don&apos;t believe, however, that just because a theory has many applications that it has to be a dominant one or come at the expense of other theories.&nbsp; For example, MOS theory and Sethares critical band theory both point toward the diatonic scale...however they can be &quot;re-routed&quot; using other variables to do bizarrely diverse things (such as make 10TET relatively consonant by finding matching timbres, in the case of Sethares).&nbsp; In a twisted way, finding what makes things &quot;the same&quot; can often be turned around to help discover how the polar opposite might be made to work well.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Somehow I don&apos;t see any connection or common elements between the  principle I have described, and your formula, or with those expensive  metals ratios...&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking (1/2)^x + 1 and 1.5 - ((1/2)^1 + 1) gives the scale 1 1.0625 1.125 1.25 1.411764 1.5...basically c,c#,d,e,f#,g with g as the period...which coincides with your scale (only yours seems to be missing the c# which equals about 1.0625...not a major difference).</p><p>&gt;&quot;Concerning chords and harmony, such artificially created scales can</p><p>really offer more in both directions.  &quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; If I&apos;m reading you well...I agree: there are so many fascinating options for scales that form so many more chords and types of harmony if you agree to let go of the octave restriction...even within pure 12TET.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t understand what you mean. If chaining is possible with fifths,</p><p>fourths are just an inversion. Fifth circle starts again after 7</p><p>octaves, fourth circle after 5.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I see what you mean: for example going a 4th down from the octave and a 5th up from the octave before it arrive at the same tone.&nbsp;</p><p>&gt;&quot;Call me ignorant, but I don&apos;t take care if anybody found</p><p>it before me, &quot;<br/>&nbsp; Well neither do I, unless people blatantly yell at my for &quot;trying to steal someone else&apos;s work&quot; when I didn&apos;t intend to.&nbsp; Which, unfortuately, seems to happen on this list all the time.&nbsp; Truth is I don&apos;t have 12 hours a day to look up the works of every single brilliant tuning expert...and I&apos;m beginning to come to the conclusion that if people want to blame me for stealing credit, that&apos;s their problem not mine.&nbsp; I just enjoy shifting through equations, testing theories by ear, and trying to make beautiful music.&nbsp; :-)</p><p>&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t think 12tone music must be dissonant, everything depends on</p><p>intervallic structure of the tone series, used harmony and the other</p><p>principles. &quot;<br/>&nbsp; Of course not...and looking over your own work gives hope that we&apos;ve by no means exhausted the combinations of chords and harmonies available with chromaticism.&nbsp; I know I&apos;ve been harsh on 12TET in the past but, to be honest, I was focussed on the limitations of the usual 7-tone diatonic scales and imitations of it (such as diatonic mean-tone) and not full-blown chromaticism.&nbsp; Nowadays I&apos;m getting more and more interested in chromaticism as an ideal way to provide new yet easily accessible scales for the usual harmonic-series-type timbres.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t understand what you mean...&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You discussed circles of 3rds, 5ths and other intervals other than the octave.&nbsp; That&apos;s what I was talking about.</p><p>-Michael</p></div>
