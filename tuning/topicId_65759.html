First, as far as scales go, from everything I&apos;ve ever read/studied about the music from any culture, from India to the Middle East to Africa and China (and of course the European tradition), they use scales...raga scales, scales for maqams, scales for Mongolian long song, or whatever...a scale is just a way of taking pitches and organizing them into a sort of cohesive format, so that&apos;s how I see it. And, as I studied with a genius bebopper for many years, scales, and the chords formed from them, became a natural way for me to think about music, and it has served me well for 35 years. (And, one of the first things George had me do was start analyzing Bach, which I still do, and as well I&apos;ve taken apart virtually every tune I&apos;ve ever played from many various styles).<br/>I have no idea if you are a player or just a theorist, but in the real world of performing musicians, scales and chords are used quite frequently, and manymany books have been written that discuss the theory behind this concept. Jazz theory, from Monk to Bird and Trane, is based very heavily on the theory of building chords from various scales, and how scales can then be used to solo through them. And, of course, it&apos;s a very profound and deep study, I&apos;m still at it after 30 years. So, I really don&apos;t see anything wrong about thinking in terms of scales...they are a vital part of all music.<br/>   And, of course, the European tradition of classical music is where this concept really started (not scales, of course, but chordal theory built from scales), so the jazz guys were not creating anything new harmonically, necessarily, but it was the element of swing in the rhythm that made jazz what it is. So, here&apos;s the way I would state it, in a very simple fashion: first, there&apos;s sound, which is, perhaps, the very foundation of the Universal structure; then, sound becomes notes/pitches, which people then organize into groupings which can be called scales; then, we can, if we choose, build chords from these scales, and from the chords come progressions, which people use to compose songs. Indeed, you said several times that what I said about chords/overtones was too simple, but, as I&apos;ve grown in my understanding of what music really is, things are getting simpler and simpler...I believe there&apos;s a quote, something like the goal of all art is simplicity, something like that, and I believe it.<br/>   And, as far as overtones, like the 7th or 15th, not being the same as notes of a chord, I think there&apos;s more than one way to see the Harmonic Series, and not so sure there&apos;s any one &quot;correct&quot; way to do that. I am well aware that the Maj 7 in a chord is supported by the other notes, that&apos;s elementary jazz theory...but, when I tune my fretless guitars to the Harmonic Series, and hit the open strings, it forms a chord. And, I&apos;m also well aware that most world cultures did not use chords in the way that Europeans have come to do, melody and rhythm are the foundations of most world musics, and Euros, for the most part, are the only bunch who wanted to harmonize notes into complex chordal structures, which lead to tempering the natural notes of the spiral of 5ths or the Harmonic Series.<br/>   So, there&apos;s all sorts of ways of looking at and analyzing music, and all sorts of music to analyze and study. When I made the comment about the dominant 7 chord being the 5th chord as opposed to the 1st, again, that&apos;s simple chordal theory, isn&apos;t it? If you build the 7 chords of a major scale, the dom 7 is the 5. And if, as you said, that&apos;s an arbitrary way of looking at it, it is, indeed, the way it has been taught for many years. And, I&apos;m not opposed to doing things different than how they are usually done, but when I teach, you gotta start somewhere, and that&apos;s where I choose to start. What is interesting to me, and maybe I didn&apos;&apos;t say it the way I wanted, is that the first 4 note chord formed by the Harmonic Series is a dominant, if you care to use that terminology...which is one of the ways I think. Yet, in traditional Western music theory, the 1 chord has, for many hundreds of years, been thought of as the primary chord in a composition...and of course, the 5th is the one that takes us back home, if you will, to the 1 (in traditional chordal theory). But, because the 7th harmonic appears in the overtone series first, I&apos;ve come to think that, perhaps, IT should be more important than the major 7; but, as I also mentioned in the post about the 22 srutis, over the years many folks in various cultures have, for some reason, chosen to avoid the 7th overtone, and I find that weird. It&apos;s there, it&apos;s part of the Creation, we didn&apos;t put it there, and yet it&apos;s caused quite a ruckus over the centuries; there&apos;s something important there. So, in the last few years, as I get deeper into my own studies, I&apos;ve thought about that phenomenon quite a lot. (Of course, the so called Major scale, and it&apos;s importance in traditional Western music, is certainly an arbitrary choice, but that&apos;s what happened). And, in blues, for example, the dom 7 IS the main chord, and that&apos;s what I&apos;m trying to integrate into my concept of teaching at this point, I&apos;m de-emphasizing the major 7 a bit, although of course it&apos;s an important chord. And, music is so incredibly deep and profound, that I&apos;m not sure any one take on it can sum it up...I do what I can, and try to use what understanding was given to me in the best way I can. So, when I describe my approach, I&apos;m sure there&apos;s more I can do, and I&apos;ll keep trying to do it.<br/>   I guess my whole point is this: there are, indeed, manymany ways to approach art, any art, and I have my way of doing it. I am studying constantly, trying to understand the structure of music at it&apos;s deepest levels, but there seems to be no end. And, I am always ready to hear what someone else has to say on music, or any subject, for that matter, and if there&apos;s something someone can help me understand better, than I am grateful to that person for teaching me something new. And, respect between people is always high on my list as well. When ego intrudes, a feeling of elitism often appears, and one can appear a bit smug or snotty...which, of course, says volumes about the person who feels that way, and doesn&apos;t exactly make others want to hear what they have to say, even if they are correct.<br/>   Or, in my St.Louis way of thinking, who wants to hang with a cheesedick? Better to be friends, don&apos;t you think? Anyway, there it is, best...HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div><h3>ambassadorbob &#x3C;ambassadorbob@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2006 6:10:58 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;    Or, in my St.Louis way of thinking, who wants to hang with a<br/>cheesedick?

I also have experience as a singer and as a<br/>composer.  I make my main income teaching guitar, classical and blues<br/>and other styles.  I also am an avid theorist and ethnomusicologist.</p><p>At any rate, to clarify, I have no argument with the basic facts you state,<br/>I simply really dislike some of the wording used, and it is as a teacher<br/>that I have such a reaction.</p><p>When I read that Jon Catler argues for use of the 13-limit because it is<br/>&quot;nature&apos;s first complete scale&quot; between harmonics 8-16, I felt that was<br/>a misrepresentation.  And that has nothing to do with my SUPPORTING<br/>his use of 13 and enjoying his music.  But defining a scale as having to<br/>have at least 7 notes, or as following the overtone series is just so<br/>arbitrary.  It is based on taking some classical theory ideas and applying<br/>them in ways that don&apos;t really make sense.  Does that mean that the<br/>notes of harmonics 8-16 don&apos;t make a scale?  Of course not.  They are<br/>a scale, sure.  And a fine one, sure.  It just isn&apos;t justified to define them<br/>as strongly, like he did.</p><p>As a teacher, I&apos;m very against giving simplistic explanations to students<br/>just because it gets them to the next level.  I feel that introduces too<br/>many misconceptions and biases later on.  When I feel the need to say<br/>things like &quot;if we stick to the scale, we&apos;ll have a major 7 on chord I&quot;<br/>I usually preface with something like &quot;this isn&apos;t the whole picture, but<br/>one way to construct chords is to stay with the notes in the scale,<br/>and here&apos;s something that&apos;s commonly done.&quot;  I feel it is important<br/>to specify what is arbitrarily the case in lots of music (such as using<br/>7 note scales) and what is unchangeable (like the harmonically<br/>defined existance of various chord intervals).</p><p>A good example is the circle of fifths.  On a tempered instrument,<br/>such a circle does exist, but not necessarily on an unfretted or<br/>in singing.  And the circle is usually taught as though it shows<br/>the whole universe of notes.  And often, learned students of<br/>theory will see some pattern that exists in some sort of scale<br/>and relate it to the circle and say &quot;OH, here&apos;s something interesting,<br/>see how if we do this then we end up here and the 7th of<br/>these chords is consistently this pattern on the circle in<br/>relation to resolving chord&quot; or something like that.  Which is<br/>kinda how your original post sounded to me.</p><p>This sort of pattern may in fact exist.  But it really isn&apos;t a statement<br/>about how music works and is perceived.  It is easy to find patterns<br/>in things, but they aren&apos;t always useful.</p><p>Maybe it was your wording.  I myself, playing in a professionally<br/>aspiring rock band for a the last couple years, noticed how much<br/>music fit better with myxolidian, flat-7 sorts of scales instead of<br/>major scales.  I&apos;m not even disagreeing with you.  I noticed the<br/>same thing.  And I certainly agree that the major scale is less than<br/>dominating these days.</p><p>I think mainly, I see the issue as a difference between practicality<br/>and theory.  It is practical to go with rules like: in a major scale<br/>we have a major 7 on chord I.  But theory-wise, these &quot;rules&quot; just<br/>don&apos;t apply.  In other words, there is no compositional, theory<br/>reason that we can&apos;t have music founded on major scales, and<br/>harmonically focused on dominant 7th chords.  Barbershop<br/>is a perfect example.</p><p>To wrap up, I have no problem with general simplistic rules<br/>for playing and improvising that are used to avoid unwanted<br/>conflicts.  But far too often, players and amateur theorists<br/>see existing patterns and apply them innapropriately and as<br/>a teacher, I feel I&apos;m working against that trend in order to have<br/>my students remain open-minded and focus on the musical<br/>elements that really drive the way the music works.  Even if<br/>they aren&apos;t interested in ever studying theory.  It is just too easy<br/>to be convinced of the significance of some patterns, even when<br/>they don&apos;t really show what is reaelly driving the music.</p><p>Like the classical/jazz 11 chord or 13 chord... They are obviously<br/>named that because of the idea of &quot;oh, I see a pattern, we can<br/>keep adding notes by thirds, generally within the scale, and<br/>make bigger chords... why not go past 7, past 9, etc.&quot;  But<br/>those chords don&apos;t have anything of the stability and<br/>functionality of the earlier ones.  A *harmonic* 11 or 13 might,<br/>but as played in jazz and neo-classical the musical affect of<br/>adding those notes is NOT something that creates a clear<br/>perceivable chord.  And it seems to me that there is NO way<br/>anyone would ever have started describing those sounds that<br/>way if it hadn&apos;t been for seeing this every-other-note-in-the-<br/>scale pattern and extending it arbitrarily, intellectually really.<br/>You may like those sounds, but that is a poor way to describe<br/>what they are musically.</p><p>Ok, so it DOES work to use that description in order to teach<br/>players simply where to put their fingers or to simply know what<br/>is happening.  But I just can&apos;t stand teaching things just enough<br/>so people can do one step.  I feel VERY strongly as a teacher that<br/>students should not be taught false associations and things that<br/>will lead to misunderstandings.</p><p>Kinda like how I was taught that C# and Db are the same.  My<br/>teacher could have simply said &quot;the same when played on the<br/>guitar or piano&quot; or something to that level, and at least I&apos;d<br/>know that there was a bigger picture out there if I ever cared<br/>to explore it, instead of gong around thinking falsehoods.</p><p>So I hope you see where I&apos;m coming from.  I think we&apos;d actually<br/>agree on most things.  Maybe not completely on teaching<br/>styles though.  But I hope you&apos;ll really consider my points,<br/>especially when it comes to teaching.  Teach the reletivity of<br/>these things if you aren&apos;t sure, and let your students come to<br/>their own conclusions or figure out what does or doesn&apos;t make<br/>sense to them.  Just make sure to leave the possibilities open<br/>by not making too strong claims about simple things.  If you<br/>get my drift (again, not everything translates to print quite right).</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>-Aaron</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@coolgoose.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2006 9:58:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron Wolf&quot; &lt;backfromthesilo@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; In other words, there is no compositional, theory<br/>&gt; reason that we can&apos;t have music founded on major scales, and<br/>&gt; harmonically focused on dominant 7th chords.

And English teachers need to stop teaching like<br/>there&apos;s some law of the universe reason that English has some of the<br/>crazy arbitrary rules it has.
