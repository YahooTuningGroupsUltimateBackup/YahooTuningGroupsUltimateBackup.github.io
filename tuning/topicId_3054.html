Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/15/1999 12:14:39 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>My dear gentlemen (and Margo),</p><p>There are two burning issues for me to update on Corporeal Meadows:</p><p>1) new links to some of the fine site whose purveyors reside here (Loffink,<br/>Monz, Starret, more) -- I have neglected expansion but will within days.</p><p>2) finally put fingers to QWERTY and write, once and for all, a basic<br/>&apos;position paper&apos; on my thoughts about performances of the works of Harry<br/>Partch. That way, when carnivals of carping like we&apos;ve seen in the last few<br/>days come up again, I can make a short &quot;here&apos;s why&quot; and then point to the<br/>link. Will save a lot of time, and the aggravation of those of you who&apos;ve<br/>seen it all before.</p><p>How-some-ever, I&apos;d like to just lightly respond to a couple of things in<br/>the last-ish digest, and I&apos;ll try to attribute correctly. Here goes:</p><p>John deLaubenfels said:<br/>&gt;I do support the idea that the<br/>&gt;composer who is the genesis of a piece of music should profit from<br/>&gt;someone else&apos;s rendition later on.  Are there issues in this case of<br/>&gt;copyrights being violated, etc.?</p><p>Ben Johnston used, for his transcription, early versions of the various<br/>Partch pieces (Barstow, U.S. Highball, others) that had expired copyrights.<br/>It is my current understanding that there have been no sharing of profits<br/>whatsoever, either with the estate of Partch (the Harry Partch Foundation)<br/>or any offers toward the custodians of Partch&apos;s instruments, Newband. My<br/>guess is that royalties get divided between Johnston and the members of<br/>Kronos. They are, to put it charitably, in it for themselves.</p><p>It should also be known that Dean Drummond was originally approached to do<br/>these transcriptions, years ago, and rejected the notion as antithetical to<br/>Partch&apos;s intentions.</p><p>David Beardsley said:<br/>&gt;The Kronos version isn&apos;t on CD. The Partch version is CRI 752.</p><p>But more to the point, the original instrumentation, from which Johnston<br/>based the bulk of his transcription, can be found in an archival recording<br/>on &quot;Enclosure 2&quot; -- of which you can find complete info on the Meadows (see<br/>below).</p><p>Joe Monzo said:<br/>&gt;I can respect the fact that Partch was indeed an absolutely<br/>&gt;unique composer</p><p>And, funny thing: all that interests me is trying to maintain some of that<br/>uniqueness. It&apos;s so many of the great unwashed that want to lump his work<br/>back into the world of concert hall, the tyranny of the proscenium arch.</p><p>&gt;However, as a composer myself, I must also state that I think<br/>&gt;there&apos;s nothing wrong with &apos;arrangements&apos;, &apos;transcriptions&apos;,<br/>&gt;or &apos;adaptations&apos; of a composer&apos;s music by other people.</p><p>Which, of course, Joe, is your choice...</p><p>&gt;Once I create a musical work, it&apos;s got a life of its own.</p><p>...when applied to *your* music. If, *if* you felt differently, and wanted<br/>to keep a clear distinction between the exacting nature of your work and<br/>the rest of the maelstrom, wouldn&apos;t you wish ethically minded (and those<br/>seeking the truth at the core of your work) to respect those wishes? Even<br/>if meant, gosh-darn-it-all, that they might not be able to perform it?</p><p>&gt;And, for the future day when I get back to archiving these<br/>&gt;Digests on the Sonic Arts website</p><p>One aside here: I notice that if you visit the OneList site and go to look<br/>at an archive (as a non-list member) the addresses of the correspondents<br/>are x&apos;ed out. I would hope you, before you make &apos;public&apos; archives<br/>available, would give due thought to privacy issues. And I know you are a<br/>concerned citizen...</p><p>&gt;[Ben Johnston] and has too much love for Partch as a composer and<br/>&gt;as a person to intentionally misrepresent him.</p><p>Then this is a case of killing with kindness. Before I wrote a word of<br/>opinion about this in public, over three years ago, I corresponded with Ben<br/>on the issues. We disagree, and I don&apos;t think his reasons and motivations<br/>are sufficient to cover the dilution and harm he does to the corpus of<br/>Partch&apos;s works. I&apos;ll have more on this when I write the op-ed piece. Later.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m sure that part of the reason he did this was to expose more<br/>&gt;people to Partch&apos;s music. (Another reason was probably to make<br/>&gt;some $$$ himself - just another aspect of being an American<br/>&gt;composer.)</p><p>I&apos;d agree, if I didn&apos;t get so many contacts from people saying how abysmal<br/>their &quot;Barstow&quot; recording was. Clearly, if one were to hear this as their<br/>only Partch experience, it could sour them.</p><p>For life.</p><p>As for the $$$, show me the dignity of treading on the bones of the<br/>departed, artistically speaking.</p><p>&gt;Again, before the bricks start flying my way from Jon Szanto,<br/>&gt;anyone wishing to learn Partch&apos;s music absolutely should seek<br/>&gt;out a live performance of it on his own instruments.  But when<br/>&gt;is that happening any time soon?</p><p>Let me be very clear: these are deep-rooted, impassioned arguments for me,<br/>but I don&apos;t view with hostility those that disagree. They may be wrong, but<br/>I don&apos;t hate them. :) But for the second point, why, on June 4th in NYC.<br/>It&apos;s posted on the site, and there was just an open house at Newband&apos;s<br/>facility a couple of weeks ago. I&apos;m going to include the tuning list on my<br/>Corporeal Meadows Email Update List (OCMEUL), with apologies to the couple<br/>of you that will get a duplicate. I send them out whenever there is a new<br/>recording, publication, concert or addition to the site.</p><p>That way, no one misses out. And go check it out, since I just put up<br/>notice today about a lecture by Warren Gilson, who recorded *the first*<br/>Barstow in Madison, WI, in 1945.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Aw, hell, I&apos;ve gone on longer than I intended. That&apos;s why I try not to post<br/>too often. I&apos;m sorry that work kept me away from Kraig and John&apos;s Excellent<br/>Microtonal Fest in LA, so I can&apos;t give any opinions. And, of course, that&apos;s<br/>all they are: opinions. Hopefully informed ones.</p><p>As I&apos;ve said before, I welcome all of you to my patch of grass in the<br/>e-world, Corporeal Meadows, where we rotate the body in all it&apos;s planes and<br/>compromise is the dirtiest of words...</p><p>Bestest, you kids,<br/>Jon<br/>..... . . . . . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . .....<br/>Jonathan M.

I think what Ben and Kronos are doing goes beyond painting a<br/>mustache on the Mona Lisa if you follows my drifff,,,,,And we used to have a<br/>little practice in my early<br/>punk activist days that may apply here....<br/>When we found a record store selling rascist or Nazi..basically negative<br/>records we would simply go into the record store in pairs either steal the<br/>recording and throw it away  or have someone cough loudly while we attempted to<br/>break the record inside the sleeve or simply pick-up the record and re-file it<br/>in the mario lanza section....not trying to prevent someones right to free<br/>speech...blah blah....but trying to battle obviously negative crapola on an<br/>grass-roots level.<br/>Better still is to NOT go to said concerts and Not review said albums so the<br/>cheeselords do not continue to record more and more compositions  but I will be<br/>honest alot of this has that &quot;Beatles hits played by the Moog synthesizer&quot; vibe<br/>you know. Any one whos knows Partch well enough probably knows this situation<br/>and people that do not. And why did the HPF not maintain said copyrights to<br/>prevent stuff like this. And Jon I admit Enclosure 2 is nice but do we really<br/>need a side of &quot;harry&apos;s Wake&quot; I mean really....that makes me question the<br/>motivation of all parties concerned. Everyone is cashing in on his genius.

I think the problem has been that 1. The people<br/>presenting his works have not recognized that his work at least includes<br/>&quot;theater&quot;, for lack of a better word. 2. They have had little or no training<br/>and or experience in visual dramatic directing. Although Partch was against<br/>specialized performers, to replace them by  naive performers was not what he<br/>had in mind! I would guess that if Partch was more successful in his lifetime<br/>he might have had to take  the same stand as Beckett and not allow any<br/>performance of his work without his direct involvement. This BTW has been my<br/>stand because attitudes like the above make me realize why I need to distrust<br/>those who feel they are free to tinker how ever they want. My advise to all<br/>composers is to take the same stand! The result would be better music!</p><p>I remember Cage said he was not experimental because he said he did all his<br/>experiments before he presented them to the public.<br/>I care not to witness anyone else&apos;s experiments</p><p>Partch has attracted &quot;followers&quot; that go on a crusade because for many he is<br/>one of the best viable alternatives to a tradition seems to be producing<br/>nothing but sterile hybrids.

Harry knew what he had to do!</p><p>If religious impulses bother you let me point out that from the point of view<br/>of the Anthropologist Mircea Eliade, western art has become nothing more than<br/>the secularization of sacred objects.</p><p>I find it harder and harder to distinguish from fashion so much of the time.</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/><a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">www.anaphoria.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=3129 href="#3129">ðŸ”—</a>Brian Carlson &#x3C;bxcarl3@xxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/18/1999 10:09:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; ...when applied to *your* music.
