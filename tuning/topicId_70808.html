A similar thing could be done for Sagittal by having characters for the individual flags (up and down versions for each), which could be combined to form a single Sagittal symbol. New symbols from existing flags could be created without changing the Unicode definition.

If the plastics industry can have their technical symbols added to the character list, it seems that there ought to be a place for Sagittal and any other notations with an established history of usage.</p></div><h3>Danny Wier &#x3C;dawiertx@sbcglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>4/1/2007 7:59:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>From: &quot;Herman Miller&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hmiller@IO.COM">hmiller@IO.COM</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Sunday, April 01, 2007 6:38 PM<br/>Subject: Re: [tuning] One rather off-topic contribution - The Unicode Character Database</p><p>&gt; Danny Wier wrote:<br/>...<br/>&gt;&gt; But getting Sagittal encoded in Unicode would be a hard sell right now,<br/>&gt;&gt; wouldn&apos;t it?
