It then fills out with four<br/>3/2 fifths, two to a side, and completes the circle of twelve fifths<br/>with two sqrt(2048/2025 sqrt(5)) fifths. This ends up adding three<br/>14/11-type major thirds into the remote keys.</p><p> i think Mahler would benefit from &gt;12,<br/>&gt; making a distincion between flats/sharps, etc.</p><p>I think you are right, not just about Mahler but by a lot of this<br/>stuff. I&apos;ve managed to get my complex number algorithm to work by<br/>calculating my &quot;argument&quot; function measure-by-measure, but converting<br/>something like the Mahler 7 to meantone would not be easy, even so.<br/>I&apos;m hoping Audio Compositor will get fixed so as to allow it to<br/>render midis created by Scala for MTS (not just retunings of 12 notes<br/>to the octave, which already works.)</p><p>&gt; i&apos;d like to work with you on making a really<br/>&gt; fantastic-sounding version of this Mahler piece.</p><p>Sounds like a plan. One thing which might help would be to send me<br/>a &quot;mechanical&quot; midi file of the whole movement; by that I mean sans<br/>rubato or dynamics of any kind. These are easier to retune, and the<br/>retuning should (when all of this actually works) be exportable. Bear<br/>in mind, however, that the result, while standard, will not be usable<br/>by most people.</p><p>&gt; i suppose i should start by putting all the separate<br/>&gt; MIDI-files into one big one, now that everyone&apos;s<br/>&gt; using more powerful computers -- there are some<br/>&gt; awkward silences in your .ogg file because of the<br/>&gt; separate MIDIs.</p><p>I removed one really, really long awkward silence and two shorter<br/>ones, actually.</p><p>&gt; ... and thanks for naming &quot;a row vector of the exponents&quot;<br/>&gt; a &quot;monzo&quot;!  :)  should i put that in the Dictionary?</p><p>My temperament programs in Maple used both p/q and row vectors for<br/>intervals, and when commenting I called the latter &quot;monzos&quot;, so I got<br/>used to privately thinking of them by that name. You can look over<br/>the site and see what you think belongs in a dictionary.</p><p>Did you download the Mahler #1 yet?</p></div><h3><a id=45437 href="#45437">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2003 8:59:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;monz&quot; &lt;monz@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_45284.html#45286">/tuning/topicId_45284.html#45286</a></p><p>&gt; i&apos;d like to work with you on making a really<br/>&gt; fantastic-sounding version of this Mahler piece.<br/>&gt; i suppose i should start by putting all the separate<br/>&gt; MIDI-files into one big one, now that everyone&apos;s<br/>&gt; using more powerful computers -- there are some<br/>&gt; awkward silences in your .ogg file because of the<br/>&gt; separate MIDIs.<br/>&gt;</p><p>***Could someone please explain to me briefly the nature and<br/>advantages of the .ogg format??</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>J.

It is also free of<br/>copyright problems and is open source; the latter means that it has<br/>been improving faster than other compression methods; some funny<br/>problems it had at first have now been eliminated, and it strikes me<br/>as really quite good. Partly since it comes out of the open-source<br/>world freeware for it is not hard to find. The only real disadvantage<br/>I know of is that mp3 players don&apos;t support ogg, but that is likely<br/>to change, as ogg has been gaining in popularity.</p><p>One way to listen to either ogg or mp3 files is to convert to wav and<br/>cut a CD; I recommend this approach.</p></div>
