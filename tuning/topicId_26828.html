I knew I could depend on an incredibly erudite response from<br/>you (chuckle)! Very much appreciated, too. Clearly out of my element<br/>on much of the history regarding these tuning issues. In response to<br/>your feedback, I probably should temper (ha-ha!) my phraseology,<br/>namely &quot;virtually universal acceptance&quot; (of 12t-ET).</p><p>I simply refer to the 19th-century period in which some of the major<br/>romantics like Schubert and Brahms frequently used enharmonic<br/>modulations that don&apos;t really work in justly tuned harmonies. I<br/>assumed that 12 EDO was behind that, and this is when the minor mode<br/>began to be used with greater frequency (which seems subjectively<br/>true to me just from musical exposure to the period, but don&apos;t ask me<br/>to document that, since I&apos;m explicitly quoting here from the<br/>assessments of my acquaintance precisely to elicit this kind of<br/>feedback, Joe).</p><p>Also I wasn&apos;t trying to establish that this period represented the<br/>first instances of such intervals. Only pointing to the alleged<br/>synchronicity among various phenomena such as increased use of 12 EDO<br/>tuning, a sudden surge in using the minor mode, and frequent use of<br/>enharmonic modulations, especially those based on the ambiguity of<br/>diminished 7ths in 12t-ET, thereby clearly implicating it.</p><p>A correction to an earlier statement of mine in this thread:<br/>&quot;This 16:20:24 triad is not as stable to my ear as the ET virtually<br/>perfect 16:19:24 triad for this very reason, I would conjecture.&quot;</p><p>The 16:20:24 ratios constitute a MAJOR triad and not the 6:5 minor<br/>3rd of the just minor triad. I should have said 10:12:15 instead of<br/>16:20:24 so the corrected statement reads:</p><p>This 10:12:15 triad is not as stable to my ear as the ET virtually<br/>perfect 16:19:24 triad for this very reason, I would conjecture.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/9/2001 1:41:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., BobWendell@t... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I simply refer to the 19th-century period in which some of the<br/>major<br/>&gt; romantics like Schubert and Brahms frequently used enharmonic<br/>&gt; modulations that don&apos;t really work in justly tuned harmonies.
