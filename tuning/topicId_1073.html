Web site is<br/><a href="http://www.mp3.com/PrentRodgers">http://www.mp3.com/PrentRodgers</a> . The songs are all based on a variety of<br/>utonality and otonality scale systems. For details on the way they were<br/>made, see my personal page at <a href="http://pws.prserv.net/music1/">http://pws.prserv.net/music1/</a> . All are made<br/>with Csound, and a macro pre-processor that simplifies modulating around<br/>the diamond, and algorithmic modifications of tones, melodies, and<br/>harmonies.</p><p><a href="http://MP3.com">MP3.com</a> lets anyone post any music by anyone. As long as you don&apos;t mind<br/>being listed next to &quot; I AM - instrumental sh*t mix&quot; by die Feuer Rabe or<br/>&quot;Something Is Wrong With My Pe*is&quot; by 404 Not Found. They will take any MP3<br/>file less than 10mb in size. They also create a real-audio sample file for<br/>those who really want to know what is wrong with Mr. 404&apos;s member, but<br/>don&apos;t want to take the 10 minutes to download the whole .mp3 file. The<br/>accumulate statistics on how many people visit, listen, or download your<br/>music, complete with charts, standings, and other info. Adding songs is<br/>quick and easy, except for the 20 minute upload part.</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Mercer Island, Washington<br/><a href="mailto:prodgers@us.ibm.com">prodgers@us.ibm.com</a></p></div>
