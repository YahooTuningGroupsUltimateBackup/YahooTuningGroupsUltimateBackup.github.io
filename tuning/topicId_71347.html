A cross-cultural teamwork is still plausible.</p><p>  As for merry making with music, this has been going on since the beginning of time.  Presently, I know only of Islamic societies, be they few and far between, that have made restrictions on music.</p><p>What news channel are you watching? BBC? Fox? CNN? Tune in to some Islamobiased channels for a change instead of Islamophobic ones.</p><p>  But then again, so did the ancient Greeks, according to Plato.</p><p>So, let not anyone be judgmental about anything based on hearsay.</p><p>  And of course, I can find that Islam can be more than a political identity.  I was wondering if it would be possible for you to distinguish a particular people&acirc;&euro;&trade;s religious identification and influence from said people&acirc;&euro;&trade;s contributions as a nation of people (in other words, somewhat independent of religious influence)?</p><p>The all-embracing supra-national context of Muslimhood precludes ethnocentrism. Unfortunately, the past century has seen the evisceration of the Islamic Civilization into petty and bickering factions all claiming to possess superior racial characteristics. It was the Age of Colonialism that awoke slumbering chauvanistic sentiments across the Middle East by the 18th century. &quot;Turk&quot; was originally a derogatory term employed by Christian Europe to mark Muslim inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire who migrated from Turkmenistan. We see increasing adoption of this term by Istanbulite Ottomans during the 19th century, probably as a reaction to the marauding fashion and etiquette of Europe. By early 20th century, the Westernist transformation of Anatolian peoples into a Turkish nation was complete.</p><p>So, I am tempted to agree that works of the past two or three centuries are shady - half Islamic, half-national (Turkish/Arabic/Persian). Very recently, Azeri, Armenian and Kurdish nationalities have emerged as well, which muddies the waters even more.</p><p>To answer your question, yes, it is possible for me to distinguish a contribution as Turkish in character, but not Islamic in culture. I see more and more bourgeois Turks forsake Islam under the guise of &quot;modernism&quot;, and write unislamic books (depicting adultery, fornication, etc...), direct unislamic movies (nudity, sex, etc...), prepare unislamic dishes (bacon, pork, etc...), manufacture unislamic products (alcoholic beverages, tobacco, etc...), indulge in unislamic art (music and paintings praising materialism, etc...) all of which are Turkish, which isn&apos;t saying much. However, this trend is recent (dating half a century at most) and its followers are a &quot;priviledged&quot; few despised by the overwhelming majority of Muslims.</p><p>  Um, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Mutazilite?&acirc;&euro;&#xFFFD;  I can only guess at by context&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;  Come again?</p><p>What? You heard nought of the great dialectical school of Islam from 12 centuries ago?

Are you interested in bullying or sharing perspectives?  Is not this why you indict the author of the book&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;for not participating in dialogue?</p><p>Do you see me bullying anyone around here irrespective of their ideas on divinity?</p><p>  More seriously, after the horrific deaths of 3 non-Islamic Turks,</p><p>Which I do not approve.</p><p>  it is incumbent on all to recognize that Islam is not the entirety of Turkey, or of any country.   I would expect you, Ozan, to agree.</p><p>Islam has never been the entirety of any geography, no matter the intolerance of Muslim rulers to other faiths. Our religion makes provisions for peaceful coexistance with people of other creeds as long as they pay tribute. In an Islamic Democracy, the lives and rights of tributary non-muslims would have been under the protection of the law and state, with severe punishments on anyone (muslim or non-muslim) inflicting them harm. Such is not the case with quasi-Islamosecular Republics such as Turkiye. If you value your life, stay clear for the time being.</p><p>  Not another word from me about the Taliban.</p><p>Good.</p><p>  Best, Johnny</p><p>Oz.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2007 2:31:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Not only music, but culture in general.

Our religion makes &gt; provisions for peaceful coexistance with people of other creeds as &gt; long as they pay tribute.<br/>As far as I am aware,  the Quran only makes explicit provisions for Christians, Jews, and Sabians (the exact referend of Sabianism as used there is controversial); an extension of dhimmitude to people of other faiths has only been  local, temporary, and controversial.  Those who convert from Islam to another faith (or even the descendents of such converts, as among the Baha&apos;i) are certainly not granted dhimmi status. While the dhimmi status, and the oft-cited injunction that there is to be no compulsion in religion seem to indicate a significant degree of tolerance, the quranic notions of saghiroon (submission) and jizya (monetary tribute) can only be taken as offensive to those who have other or no beliefs;  indeed, in some faiths and to many people of conscious, acceptance of saghiroon and jizya would be considered apostacy or a betrayal of their fundamental values, thus Muslims demand from people of other faiths that they act in a way toward their own faith or conscious that would be impossible -- or punishable by death -- if a Muslim acted in the same way towards Islam.</p><p>A diversity of coexisting religions probably creates an inevitable competition among them and probably places an undue emphasis on their differences.  The three major Abrahamic religions have an in-built tension due to their difference, a viscious circle even, in that one religion identifies the faithful with an ethnicity and -- at least, implicitly -- a state, a second opens the faith to all believers but severs itself from any identification with a temporal state, rendering unto God and Caesar different realms of human affairs, and the third is open to all but recognizes no division between faith and state.  I believe that the lack of symmetry in relationships between Muslims and people of other faiths is always going to be a serious constraint on their coexistence.  As long as Mosques can be built in Europe, but neither churches nor synagogues in Saudi Arabia, this will be a serious constraint; as long as conversion can only made in one direction (i.e. towards Islam), this will be a serious constraint; and as long Muslims speak of &quot;no compulsion in religion&quot; but act otherwise, one cannot expect any fundamental improvement.  Pessmistically, I have the impression that this state of affairs is so built into the foundations of the faith -- a faith that permits no further prophesy -- that any substantial change is all but impossible.</p><p>djw</p></div><h3>Ozan Yarman &#x3C;ozanyarman@ozanyarman.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/22/2007 5:36:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:clumma@yahoo.com">clumma@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: 23 Nisan 2007 Pazartesi 1:52<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Has anyone read or reviewed this Serge Donval book<br/>yet? -Ozan</p><p>&gt; &gt; And humans who are in a position to manipulate technology have<br/>&gt; &gt; no part in the degeneration of foreign cultures then?
