This FAQ<br/>includes the article on the Landini cadence mentioned in this thread,</p><p><a href="http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/landini.html">http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/landini.html</a></p><p>You raised a very important point about &quot;closest approach&quot; and the<br/>Landini cadence whose ramifications I realized only after my initial<br/>reply, Your musical observation was a very insigntful one, and I hope<br/>that I can do it more justice below.</p><p>&gt; I just got a whole mess of CDs from the list on the medievel<br/>&gt; site. Great stuff and exactly what I was looking for.  Regarding the<br/>&gt; first cadence, One thing I hear done sometimes is a sort of<br/>&gt; apogatura-kind-of-thing (to get scientific) where it goes</p><p>&gt;     E4  D4  F4<br/>&gt;     B3      C4<br/>&gt;     G3      F3</p><p>This is a very common 14th-15th century idiom, sometimes found in the<br/>13th century and also in some later Renaissance/Manneristic pieces,<br/>called a &quot;Landini cadence,&quot; with an unstable major sixth momentarily<br/>moving down to the fifth before the expected resolution which would<br/>have occurred if the sixth had simply expanded conjunctly to an<br/>octave.</p><p>The term I use for the momentary tone D4, or the vertical fifth G3-D4<br/>or the overall sonority G3-B3-D4 in which it participates, is an<br/>&quot;antimediating&quot; tone or sonority, as I&apos;ll explain shortly -- a<br/>category for which the Landini cadence may be an especially familiar<br/>example. Note that my terminology focuses specifically on Gothic and<br/>neo-Gothic music.</p><p>&gt; Now I hear it in tonal terms somthing like VII- II I which is<br/>&gt; unusual but right on target for a harmonic cadence in lydian (not<br/>&gt; that the authors were thinking in those terms). You could do the<br/>&gt; same thing with the second cadence.</p><p>Please let me begin by saying that there are many ways of hearing,<br/>often with rich and surprising associations. For example, I once heard<br/>a Burmese song called _The Southern Island_ which reminded me very<br/>much of Machaut in a delightful way. The album notes said something<br/>like this: &quot;A typical Burmese chord consists of the raised fourth and<br/>seventh, resolving into the fifth and eighth degrees.&quot;</p><p>From a stylistic or specifically intonational view, I would emphasize<br/>that in a typical Gothic setting either G3-B3-D4 or G3-B3-E4 is an<br/>inherently unstable sonority, and that the complex thirds and sixths<br/>of Pythagorean tuning tend to reinforce this musical tension.</p><p>With G3-B3-D4 we have a _quinta fissa_ sonority, or fifth &quot;split&quot; by<br/>the middle voice into two mildly unstable thirds (5 + M3 + m3,<br/>64:81:96, a rounded 0-408-702 cents). WIth G3-B3-E4 we have a major<br/>sixth sonority with major third below and fourth above (M6 + 5 + M3,<br/>64:81:108, 0-408-906 cents).</p><p>Both these sonorities have G3 as the _fundamentum_ or &quot;foundation,&quot;<br/>and both frequently resolve to a complete 2:3:4 trine on F, F3-C4-F4.</p><p>In a 14th-century Landini cadence, I would say that the pull of the<br/>major sixth toward the octave is such a basic and compelling<br/>progression that indeed the sixth is more the &quot;main&quot; interval, and the<br/>fifth more like a decorative element.</p><p>In my view, a &quot;harmonic/nonharmonic&quot; dichotomy may oversimplify the<br/>interactions between vertical and melodic elements in 13th-14th<br/>century styles, just as Ludmilla Ulehla has cautioned about the<br/>problems of attempting systematically to apply such categories to<br/>20th-century European and related styles.</p><p>However, it is possible to devise categories which recognize both the<br/>melodic motivations for a given note or sonority and the directed<br/>vertical resolution to which this note or sonority may give rise.</p><p>In explaining why I call the Landini cadence a kind of &quot;antimediating&quot;<br/>figure, I should explain that the progression from fifth to octave by<br/>way of an unstable major sixth is very common in Gothic music:</p><p> D4   E4   F4<br/> G3        F3</p><p> 5    M6   8<br/>3:2 27:16 2:1<br/>702  906 1200</p><p>Here the major sixth G3-E4 &quot;mediates&quot; between the stable fifth and<br/>octave, at once making it possible to move between these intervals<br/>with purely stepwise motion in the upper voice (D4-E4-F4), and<br/>introducing the vertical element of directed instability, the sixth<br/>expanding to the octave by stepwise contrary motion.</p><p>Here are some other examples of mediating tones and sonorities<br/>approached obliquely and resolved by directed contrary motion:</p><p> E4   D4    C4         G3   B3    C4        A3    B3    C4<br/> E3         F3         G3         F3        A3          F3</p><p> 8    m7    5          1    M3    5         1     M2    5<br/>2:1  16:9  3:2        1:1  81:64 3:2       1:1   9:8   3:2<br/>1200  996  702         0    408  702        0    204   702</p><p>In the Landini cadence, however, we have a &quot;time-reversed&quot; version of<br/>the 5-6-8 figure with the mediating sixth:</p><p>  E4   D4   F4<br/>  G3        F3</p><p>  M6   5    8<br/>27:16 3:2  2:1<br/> 906  702  1200</p><p>The term &quot;antimediating tone/sonority&quot; for the note D4 and the<br/>sonority G3-D4 -- the melodic and vertical dimensions of this M6-5-8<br/>idiom -- may suggest that the decorative fifth at once makes the<br/>resolution from major sixth to octave a bit _less_ direct and<br/>&quot;efficient,&quot; and makes the upper part _less_ conjunct. Putting this<br/>another way, we have a momentary diversion from the expected<br/>consummation of M6-8, and a very graceful melodic figure of the third<br/>D4-F4 in the upper voice.</p><p>&gt; Is the use of the D just an embellishment? Was it common, as it<br/>&gt; seems to go against closest approach (and I know they don&apos;t do the<br/>&gt; E4 D4 E4 F4 sequence that you would hear if it was a V I cadence a<br/>&gt; few centurys later).</p><p>After my first and rather hasty reply, I realized that while there<br/>isn&apos;t a conflict with the &quot;closest approach&quot; principle as defined in<br/>the 14th century (and later), you have most insightfully pointed out<br/>an issue of what I might call &quot;most direct or efficient approach.&quot;</p><p>Here a look at some three-voice cadences common in the 13th century<br/>may be helpful.</p><p>As discussed above, I would regard the major sixth of the Landini<br/>cadence as the more &quot;basic&quot; interval, and the antimediating fifth as<br/>more decorative. However, to place this idiom in perspective, we<br/>should note that all of the following are common in the 13th century:</p><p>   E4  F4              D4  C4          D4   F4<br/>   B3  C4              B3  C4          B3   C4<br/>   G3  F3              G3  F3          G3   F3</p><p>(M6-8 + M3-5)      (M3-5 + m3-1)       (M3-5)</p><p>As it happens, all of these cadences on F fit the 14th-century<br/>&quot;closest approach&quot; rule, which says this: &quot;A third expanding to a<br/>fifth, or a sixth to an octave, should be major; a third contracting<br/>to a unison should be minor.&quot;</p><p>However, your question may relate to what I call &quot;most direct<br/>approach.&quot; In the first or second cadence, every unstable interval<br/>resolves by stepwise contrary motion, the most efficient or direct<br/>resolution possible.</p><p>In the third cadence, however, the minor third between the two upper<br/>voices of G3-B3-D4 resolves instead by similar motion to the upper<br/>fourth of the trine F3-C4-F4. This choice might be motivating by a<br/>liking for the melodic minor third in the highest voice, and also by a<br/>desire to arrive at more complete and sonorous trine rather than the<br/>simple fifth F3-C4 of the second cadence with &quot;most direct approach.&quot;</p><p>With the Landini cadence, we have more of a partial qualification to<br/>&quot;most direct approach&quot; -- the major sixth does resolve to the octave,<br/>but not without the more or less momentary diversion of the<br/>intervening fifth.</p><p>For example, one early 14th-century treatise, maybe one ascribed to<br/>Philippe de Vitry or a student, declares that &quot;the major sixth<br/>proceeds to the octave, and without fail&quot; -- a bit of an<br/>overgeneralization, but a very nice statement of a general<br/>expectation.</p><p>Marchettus of Padua, in 1318, likewise discusses the use of a &quot;feigned<br/>color&quot; or deceptive cadence in which the major sixth does not expand<br/>to the octave, but contracts to a fifth by a progression in stepwise<br/>contrary motion involving a direct chromatic semitone. This is the<br/>exception that proves the musical rule, we might say.</p><p>The Landini cadence, by contrast, seems a gentle and graceful<br/>decoration of the basic M6-8 resolution. It embellishes rather than<br/>obscures the directed cadential action.</p><p>There are some fine points I could add on questions of degrees of<br/>consonance and intonation, but this is already a long reply.</p><p>In fact, my main concern is that I don&apos;t want the length to inhibit a<br/>very engaging dialogue, and I&apos;d emphasize again that there are many<br/>ways of hearing and analyzing.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
