I remember seeing a few at the store where I bought my WX5 and<br/>VL70-m. You&apos;ll at least be able to see them in action and demonstrated,<br/>rather than trying to select one from specifications / ad copy on a web<br/>page. Once you know what you want, you can always order off the web if the<br/>music store&apos;s price is too high. My guess is, though, that a music store<br/>will be competitive and you&apos;ll be able to take whatever you chose home with<br/>you. Maybe I should take my own advice and see if they have any training<br/>tools for the WX5 :-).<br/>--<br/>M.
