No so easy. We could use &quot;7&quot; and &quot;L&quot; except<br/>that we already put 7 after letter names to mean 7th chords, and the hook<br/>on the &quot;L&quot; is on the opposite side from the Sims glyph, and now this idiot<br/>Keenan wants to have a note called &quot;L&quot;. We might think we could use &quot;J&quot; or<br/>&quot;j&quot; instead of &quot;L&quot;, except the serifs make them look more like the Sims +3<br/>step symbol, the half-up-arrow with a flag.</p><p>I have to say, it seems pretty dumb on Sims part, to use a half arrow to<br/>designate _twice_ the shift designated by a full-arrow. Shouldn&apos;t it have<br/>been the other way around. Or maybe use an arrow with a double-barbed head<br/>(one head under the other) instead of half a head. But everyone keeps<br/>telling me we&apos;re stuck with the Sims glyphs. So on we march.</p><p>Monz has chosen to use &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot; for these. It&apos;s difficult to remember<br/>which is up and which is down. Even Monz himself got these swapped around<br/>on an early Miracle lattice. But unless anyone can suggest something better<br/>to represent the Sims half-arrows, I guess we&apos;ll stick with them. At least<br/>they are visually bigger than the &quot;^&quot; and &quot;v&quot; for +-1 step.</p><p>+2 &gt;<br/>-2 &lt;</p><p>I have been using &quot;//&quot; and &quot;\\&quot; for these shifts.</p><p>----------<br/>+-3/72 oct<br/>----------</p><p>Now we come to the 1/4 tone half-arrows-with-flags, one of which looks like<br/>a square-root symbol and the other of which looks a bit like a lowercase<br/>&quot;j&quot; without the dot. Let&apos;s face it, there isn&apos;t any ASCII character that<br/>looks even remotely like the square-root symbol, and for that reason I<br/>propose we use a symbol that is at least reminiscent of the Tartini<br/>half-sharp symbol (also shown on Ted Mook&apos;s page, URL above). Manuel has<br/>already chosen to use &quot;|&quot; for half-sharp in Scala for this reason. He also<br/>chose &quot;;&quot; for half-flat. And those are what I have been using.</p><p>There is no need for these symbols to be a symmetrical pair. The Sims<br/>glyphs are not. There is no reflection or rotation that will map Sims&apos; 1/4<br/>up symbol to his 1/4 down symbol. I already suggested &quot;j&quot; as the 1/4 down<br/>symbol. I think this is better than &quot;;&quot;.</p><p>I also think that &quot;|&quot; is not good because it has no direction to it and<br/>could equally be the vertical stroke of a Tartini half-flat (or a backwards<br/>flat) as a half-sharp. Lwer case &quot;f&quot; isn&apos;t bad. It looks good as a pair<br/>with &quot;j&quot;. From &quot;fj&quot; it&apos;s easy to see which one is up and which is down. But<br/>it could be a problem since &quot;F&quot; is the name of a note, even though we can<br/>use uppercase for the note name and lowercase for the accidental. &quot;t&quot; might<br/>be a better choice.</p><p>+3 f or t<br/>-3 j</p><p>----------<br/>Keenan-ese<br/>----------</p><p>So you see it&apos;s not so much Keenan-ese as Scala-ese. But in choosing when<br/>to favour C# over Db etc. my spelling owes its primary alleigance to<br/>meantone rather than to 12-tET. It just so happens that, in 72-EDO,<br/>meantone _is_ 12-tET.</p><p>By the way Monz, I don&apos;t believe you correctly translated any of my Scala<br/>file comments into your notation. It&apos;s partly because you want to make them<br/>agree at C whereas I want to use D (since it is a point of symmetry, and I<br/>don&apos;t know how to say (in a Scala file that is assumed to start on C) that<br/>the &quot;C&quot; needs to be at something other than 0 cents. I asked that question<br/>a few days ago, and no one responded.</p><p>But let&apos;s leave those Scala files until we sort out this ASCII notation.</p><p>Graham, I think you misunderstood. Joseph and Monz are referring to the<br/>meantone based notation as Keenan-ese, not the one with 10 natural letters.<br/>They aren&apos;t even looking at that, or the decimal numbers.</p><p>Your auto-generated meantone based notation seems to disagree with mine, on<br/>more than just what symbols to use.<br/>See <a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/MiraclePitchChart.htm">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena/Music/MiraclePitchChart.htm</a><br/>If you ASCIIfy it, please use | for half-sharp and ; for half-flat, at<br/>least until we get this mess sorted out.</p><p>Maybe when we sort this out, you can have your program generate a list for<br/>Canasta with 6 columns showing: degrees of 72-EDO (0=C), decimal numbers<br/>(4=D), decimal letters (D=D), &quot;Keenanese&quot;, &quot;Monzonian&quot;, and hopefully &quot;new<br/>Monzonian&quot; i.e. whatever new scheme we come up with, which will simply be<br/>old Monzonian with some characters changed.</p><p>Lets hear some other thoughts on how to get out of this mess.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/>Brisbane, Australia<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3><a id=23585 href="#23585">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/22/2001 8:59:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., David C Keenan &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_23583.html#23583">/tuning/topicId_23583.html#23583</a></p><p>Cute subject-line, Dave!</p><p>&gt; I can&apos;t believe the mess we&apos;ve gotten ourselves into with ASCII<br/>accidentals.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thank you so VERY much, Dave, for this interesting and PRACTICAL post<br/>about possible 72-tET notations in ascii!</p><p>&gt; Here&apos;s how I see it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no great problem with the Sims (USA?) notation when folks<br/>use the proper non-ASCII glyphs.

Let&apos;s face it, there isn&apos;t any<br/>ASCII character that looks even remotely like the square-root symbol,<br/>and for that reason I propose we use a symbol that is at least<br/>reminiscent of the Tartini half-sharp symbol (also shown on Ted<br/>Mook&apos;s page, URL above).</p><p>This, frankly, really bothers me too.  In fact, I had at first<br/>considered using the &quot;default&quot; versions of these 1/4 tone accidentals<br/>in my notation program.  They really are almost STANDARD by now...<br/>particularly the little line with the one little slash through it!</p><p>Of course, they don&apos;t exist in ASCII.</p><p>Since I WAS able to create my OWN font in my program that virtually<br/>replicates the Sims/Maneri notation, I decided to go with that...</p><p>It was a &quot;conservative&quot; gesture, but if people really are playing<br/>this 72-tET music and practicing ear training with it, it&apos;s important<br/>to try to maintain the conventions they have already learned (no<br/>matter HOW bizarre... that&apos;s happened, obviously, MANY times in<br/>history before!)</p><p>&gt;Manuel has already chosen to use &quot;|&quot; for half-sharp in Scala for<br/>this reason. He also chose &quot;;&quot; for half-flat. And those are what I<br/>have been using.<br/>&gt;</p><p>OK... I was rather wondering what those were all about... thanks...</p><p>&gt; There is no need for these symbols to be a symmetrical pair. The<br/>Sims glyphs are not.</p><p>Yeah, I know... They are mighty strange...</p><p>There is no reflection or rotation that will map Sims&apos; 1/4<br/>&gt; up symbol to his 1/4 down symbol. I already suggested &quot;j&quot; as the<br/>1/4 down symbol. I think this is better than &quot;;&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also think that &quot;|&quot; is not good because it has no direction to it<br/>and could equally be the vertical stroke of a Tartini half-flat (or a<br/>backwards flat) as a half-sharp.

I think the &quot;f&quot; is really a problem, since it&apos;s a named<br/>note already.  Can you imagine a musician seeing a note with an &quot;f&quot;<br/>in front of it, and not thinking something about &quot;F.&quot;  I can&apos;t...</p><p>Maybe that one needs some more thinking... I would tend to go with<br/>Manuel&apos;s | and ; ... now that I understand them...</p><p>Maybe one could even put a &quot;+&quot; in FRONT of the &quot;|&quot;</p><p>Like this:  +|</p><p>Then, it kind of looks like one wanted to put the cross over the<br/>middle of the line like the Tartini but, of course, couldn&apos;t in<br/>ascii..  That way it wouldn&apos;t be confused with a possible Tartini<br/>flat...</p><p>Just an idea...</p><p>I think right now, after this discussion, I would vote for:</p><p>^ = 1/12 high<br/>v = 1/12 low</p><p>&gt; = 1/6 high<br/>&lt; = 1/6 low</p><p>+| = 1/4 high<br/>; = 1/4 low</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>OH... by the way, MONZ...

This is just a very cursory first response to<br/>your proposals.  I&apos;m going to print this message and study<br/>it much more carefully, then give further thoughts.</p><p>Much of what I&apos;m saying in this post is historical background<br/>on how I came up with my various uses of 72-EDO accidentals,<br/>and hopefully, enough justification for my choices that<br/>perhaps you will finally see why I adhere to them so strongly.</p><p>First comment: awesome pun in the subject line!</p><p>&gt; Clearly the Sims up and down (full) arrows, which correspond<br/>&gt; to 17c &quot;comma&quot; or &quot;1/12 tone&quot; shifts are the ones most<br/>&gt; deserving of being transliterated to &quot;^&quot; and &quot;v&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But unfortunately we had Richter-Herf (Europe?) independently<br/>&gt; come up with a system for 72-EDO which used up and down (full)<br/>&gt; arrows for 50c or &quot;1/4 tone&quot; shifts. This is apparently where<br/>&gt; Monz got the idea from.</p><p>Actually, the use of up and down arrows to represent 1/4-tones<br/>has quite a long history, going much further back than Herf.</p><p>In fact, I chose to use arrows for 1/4-tones long before I<br/>ever knew anything about Herf, Sims, or 72-EDO.  There have<br/>been many different proposals for 1/4-tone notation, and<br/>the arrows are the ones that always made the most sense to me.</p><p>When I first encountered Sims&apos;s notation, I immediately disliked<br/>the square-root signs for 1/4-tones, and also disliked the<br/>fact that he used the arrows which I (and others) preferred<br/>for 1/4-tones, to represent the 1/12-tones.</p><p>When I encountered Herf&apos;s notation shortly after that, I saw<br/>that he was in &quot;agreement&quot; with me about the use of the arrows,<br/>and he used the very simple and short / and \ for 1/12-tones.<br/>So I provisionally decided to use Herf notation for 72-EDO.<br/>This was around 1994 or so.</p><p>&gt; It seems that for acceptance of Miracle, in the only place<br/>&gt; that 72-EDO is being taught officially, we need to be<br/>&gt; consistent with the Sims notation.  We can forget Richter Hoef.<br/>&gt; One of them has to lose, since they use arrows to mean<br/>&gt; completely different things.</p><p>I have already posted much on this.  I strongly disagree, and<br/>in fact am of the opinion that we here on the tuning list<br/>should make a concerted communal effort to try to convince<br/>the Bostonians to switch to using the ASCII 72-EDO notation<br/>I presented here.  They *are* indeed possibly the only ones<br/>teaching and learning 72-EDO &quot;officially&quot;.</p><p>(Herf&apos;s legacy in Salzburg, Austria includes an institute named<br/>after him, but I don&apos;t know much about it and don&apos;t know how<br/>seriously 72-EDO is being cultivated there now that he&apos;s no<br/>longer alive.  Any further info would be appreciated.)</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ----------<br/>&gt; +-1/72 oct<br/>&gt; ----------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now we should look for ASCII characters that actually _look_<br/>&gt; something like the Sims glyphs. It&apos;s obvious that &quot;^&quot; and &quot;v&quot;<br/>&gt; should stand for the Sims complete arrows. &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; don&apos;t<br/>&gt; look like them at all. And I understand that the way in which<br/>&gt; Ben Johnson uses &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; is completely at odds with how<br/>&gt; Monz has been using them.</p><p>No, Dave, not &quot;completely&quot; at odds at all.</p><p>Johnston uses + and - to indicate shifts of a syntonic comma,<br/>which is *exactly* what they mean in my HEWM prime-factor<br/>notation, and very closely approximate what they mean in<br/>ASCII 72-EDO notation.</p><p>The difference is that Johnston starts with the 2-dimensional<br/>5-limit scale as his basis, so his commatic shifts follow<br/>a pattern on the lattice that simply is not intuitive and<br/>must be memorized.  I use Pythagorean as the notational basis<br/>for the nominals (and # and b), so the + and - always indicate<br/>an exponent of 1 along the 5-axis.</p><p>My use of + and - for 72-EDO grew directly out of my use<br/>of them for HEWM.  And my inspiration to use them for HEWM<br/>grew out of my interest in Johnston&apos;s notation.</p><p>Upon encountering Johnston&apos;s notation and realizing how<br/>1/12-tone functioned as an approximate syntonic comma in 72-EDO,<br/>I decided that I liked + and - much better than Herf&apos;s / and \<br/>for the 1/12-tones.</p><p>&gt; ----------<br/>&gt; +-2/72 oct<br/>&gt; ----------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now for the Sims half-arrows. No so easy. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have to say, it seems pretty dumb on Sims part, to use a<br/>&gt; half arrow to designate _twice_ the shift designated by a<br/>&gt; full-arrow. Shouldn&apos;t it have been the other way around.</p><p>Exactly my way of thinking.  That&apos;s why for me the full arrow<br/>is a 1/4-tone and the half-arrow is a 1/6-tone.</p><p>And again, my use of the half-arrows grew out of my interest<br/>in Johnston&apos;s notation.  He uses &quot;7&quot; to represent and inflection<br/>of 7^1, and an upside down 7 that can only be rendered in<br/>ASCII approximately as &quot;L&quot; for 7^-1.  The half-arrow pointing<br/>down looks quite a bit like Johnston&apos;s inverted 7.</p><p>When trying to render all this in ASCII, I decided that &quot;&lt;&quot;<br/>looked a lot better as an accidental than &quot;L&quot;, and so I decided<br/>to use that to represent 7^-1 in HEWM.  Simple logic dictated<br/>that &quot;&gt;&quot; would be the reverse corollary.</p><p>Also, the fact that &lt; and &gt; are mathematical symbols, gave<br/>them a relationship to the use of + and -, so to me it made<br/>a lot of sense to employ them.</p><p>(And in case anyone missed it, I&apos;ll reiterate here that<br/>&lt; and &gt; were the symbols Schoenberg experimentally chose<br/>to indicate 1/4-tones around 1908-9.)</p><p>&gt; Monz has chosen to use &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot; for these. It&apos;s difficult<br/>&gt; to remember which is up and which is down. Even Monz himself<br/>&gt; got these swapped around on an early Miracle lattice.</p><p>Hey, it can happen to anyone at any time... simple human<br/>capacity for error.

Well, these take some &quot;getting used to&quot; as well...</p><p>Yes. I prefer either arrows or half-arrows for comma shifts rather than the<br/>slashes. And it seems the original Tartini half-flat has been replaced by a<br/>backwards flat (on Ted Mook&apos;s page).<br/><a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~tmook/micro.html">http://www.mindspring.com/~tmook/micro.html</a><br/>This is probably a good move since the half flat glyph could easily be<br/>misread as a flat (I would think). Is the backward flat more standard these<br/>days?</p><p>&gt; &gt; I have to say, it seems pretty dumb on Sims part, to use a half<br/>&gt; arrow to designate _twice_ the shift designated by a full-arrow.<br/>&gt; Shouldn&apos;t it have been the other way around.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That makes sense...</p><p>Is it really too late. We certainly couldn&apos;t swap their usage.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Or maybe use an arrow with a double-barbed head (one head under the<br/>&gt; other) instead of half a head. But everyone keeps telling me we&apos;re<br/>&gt; stuck with the Sims glyphs. So on we march.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It rather seems that way... Paul Erlich believes this, and there is<br/>&gt; going to be someone from the Boston Microtonal Society (hopefully)<br/>&gt; expressing HIS opinion about this on the list...</p><p>I look forward to that. Fortunately a 1/6-tone symbol isn&apos;t really needed,<br/>but I still propose double-barbed arrows rather than half arrows. e.g.<br/>  .<br/> /|\       |<br/>/ | \      |<br/> /|\     \ | /<br/>/ | \     \|/<br/>  |      \ | /<br/>  |       \|/<br/>           &apos;<br/>which we could ASCIIfy unambiguously as ^^ and vv. Maybe they are a bit<br/>tedious for handwritten scores, but as I say, you don&apos;t need them very often</p><p>&gt; &gt; Now we come to the 1/4 tone half-arrows-with-flags, one of which<br/>&gt; looks like a square-root symbol and the other of which looks a bit<br/>&gt; like a lowercase &quot;j&quot; without the dot. Let&apos;s face it, there isn&apos;t any<br/>&gt; ASCII character that looks even remotely like the square-root<br/>symbol,<br/>&gt; and for that reason I propose we use a symbol that is at least<br/>&gt; reminiscent of the Tartini half-sharp symbol (also shown on Ted<br/>&gt; Mook&apos;s page, URL above).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This, frankly, really bothers me too.  In fact, I had at first<br/>&gt; considered using the &quot;default&quot; versions of these 1/4 tone<br/>accidentals<br/>&gt; in my notation program.</p><p>Well hell why not. Tell Sims what to do with his square-root. ;-)</p><p>&gt;  They really are almost STANDARD by now...<br/>&gt; particularly the little line with the one little slash through it!</p><p>Ok. This sounds like the Tartini half-sharp has been modified too. The one<br/>in the Fokker paper (and on Ted Mook&apos;s page) has two horizontal strokes.<br/>Can you more thoroughly describe the 1/4 tone symbols you are talking about<br/>here? Either an ASCII drawing or a scan?</p><p>&gt; Of course, they don&apos;t exist in ASCII.</p><p>Neither does anything else, so this isn&apos;t really an issue.</p><p>&gt; Boy, Dave... I think the &quot;f&quot; is really a problem, since it&apos;s a named<br/>&gt; note already.  Can you imagine a musician seeing a note with an &quot;f&quot;<br/>&gt; in front of it, and not thinking something about &quot;F.&quot;  I can&apos;t...</p><p>Er Joseph, again, I&apos;m not talking about putting these symbols on a real<br/>score. I&apos;m talking about symbols that we can use to represent the &quot;real&quot;<br/>symbols (whether Sims or modified Tartini) in net discussions. So that we<br/>can look at the ASCII glyph but in our &quot;minds eye&quot; see the &quot;real&quot; glyph.<br/>&quot;f&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are both able to do that for me in regard to the Tartini<br/>half-sharp. But then so does &quot;|&quot; now that I&apos;ve learnt it. We&apos;re already<br/>using a letter &quot;v&quot;. But yeah, forget &quot;f&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Maybe that one needs some more thinking... I would tend to go with<br/>&gt; Manuel&apos;s | and ; ... now that I understand them...</p><p>Ok. Excellent. That&apos;s fine with me.</p><p>&gt; Maybe one could even put a &quot;+&quot; in FRONT of the &quot;|&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Like this:  +|</p><p>Hmm. I don&apos;t like it, given that the &quot;+&quot; has already been used on its own.<br/>Best to avoid multiple characters for a single symbol if possible. The &quot;^^&quot;<br/>and &quot;vv&quot; as proposed above, work as two-character symbols because they have<br/>the same meaning as the single character symbol applied twice.</p><p>&gt; Then, it kind of looks like one wanted to put the cross over the<br/>&gt; middle of the line like the Tartini but, of course, couldn&apos;t in<br/>&gt; ascii..  That way it wouldn&apos;t be confused with a possible Tartini<br/>&gt; flat...</p><p>Maybe this is not so important now that you understand I&apos;m only proposing<br/>these ASCII character as stand-ins for net discussions.</p><p>&gt; I think right now, after this discussion, I would vote for:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ^ = 1/12 high<br/>&gt; v = 1/12 low<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; = 1/6 high<br/>&gt; &lt; = 1/6 low<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; +| = 1/4 high<br/>&gt; ; = 1/4 low</p><p>Drop that plus sign and I&apos;m with you. But I&apos;m still open to other suggestions.</p><p>By the way, I would never use | and ; (1/4 tone shifts) in combination with<br/># and b. I see these four symbols as forming a mutually exclusive set, to<br/>be modified by the other accidentals. So there is a sense in which we are<br/>going 12-tET -&gt; 24-EDO -&gt; 72-EDO.</p><p>Graham, One thing I forgot to mention before. Whatever ASCII (or real)<br/>symbol we decide on for 1/6 tones, it would be good if we could use the<br/>same symbol for the chromatic shift in the decimal notation.

There have<br/>&gt; been many different proposals for 1/4-tone notation, and<br/>&gt; the arrows are the ones that always made the most sense to me.</p><p>Why?</p><p>The problem seems to be that arrows are the ones that always make the most<br/>sense to _everyone_ as a new accidental, irrespective of what _size_ they<br/>want them to be.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It seems that for acceptance of Miracle, in the only place<br/>&gt; &gt; that 72-EDO is being taught officially, we need to be<br/>&gt; &gt; consistent with the Sims notation.  We can forget Richter Hoef.<br/>&gt; &gt; One of them has to lose, since they use arrows to mean<br/>&gt; &gt; completely different things.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have already posted much on this.  I strongly disagree, and<br/>&gt; in fact am of the opinion that we here on the tuning list<br/>&gt; should make a concerted communal effort to try to convince<br/>&gt; the Bostonians to switch to using the ASCII 72-EDO notation<br/>&gt; I presented here.  They *are* indeed possibly the only ones<br/>&gt; teaching and learning 72-EDO &quot;officially&quot;.</p><p>If you think they are gonna switch from using full arrows for 1/12-tones to<br/>using them for 1/4-tones, I think you&apos;re living in fantasy-land. Sorry. I<br/>don&apos;t think they would do it if the god of music herself told them to. It<br/>would be too confusing, since they presumably already have a large body of<br/>work (and people) that use them. Introducing completely different symbols<br/>is one thing, but changing the meaning of an existing symbol is quite another.</p><p>&gt; &gt; And I understand that the way in which<br/>&gt; &gt; Ben Johnson uses &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; is completely at odds with how<br/>&gt; &gt; Monz has been using them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, Dave, not &quot;completely&quot; at odds at all.</p><p>Ok. Perhaps I shouldn&apos;t have said &quot;completely&quot;. My point is, for example,<br/>(as you confirmed), in Johnson&apos;s notation the JI wolf is notated D:A, in<br/>your notation it is D:A-. A musican familiar with Johnson&apos;s notation would<br/>play entirely the wrong thing if presented with a score using +- in the way<br/>you have been using them. Better to make a clear distinction and use / and<br/>\, or Simms arrows (ASCIIfied as ^ and v), for comma shifts in non-Johnson<br/>notation.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I have to say, it seems pretty dumb on Sims part, to use a<br/>&gt; &gt; half arrow to designate _twice_ the shift designated by a<br/>&gt; &gt; full-arrow. Shouldn&apos;t it have been the other way around.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly my way of thinking.  That&apos;s why for me the full arrow<br/>&gt; is a 1/4-tone and the half-arrow is a 1/6-tone.</p><p>This might make sense if a 1/4 tone were twice a 1/6 tone, but last I<br/>checked it wasn&apos;t. :-)</p><p>&gt; And again, my use of the half-arrows grew out of my interest<br/>&gt; in Johnston&apos;s notation.  He uses &quot;7&quot; to represent and inflection<br/>&gt; of 7^1, and an upside down 7 that can only be rendered in<br/>&gt; ASCII approximately as &quot;L&quot; for 7^-1.  The half-arrow pointing<br/>&gt; down looks quite a bit like Johnston&apos;s inverted 7.</p><p>Yes I was aware of this relationship between the half-arrows, the numeral 7<br/>and the 7th harmonic.</p><p>&gt; When trying to render all this in ASCII, I decided that &quot;&lt;&quot;<br/>&gt; looked a lot better as an accidental than &quot;L&quot;, and so I decided<br/>&gt; to use that to represent 7^-1 in HEWM.  Simple logic dictated<br/>&gt; that &quot;&gt;&quot; would be the reverse corollary.</p><p>I assumed that was the case. But really, knowing that it has something to<br/>do with the seventh harmonic, will be irrelevant to most musicians reading<br/>the score in order to play it. And all you have to do is transpose, and<br/>suddenly the half-arrows have nothing whatsoever to do with the 7th<br/>harmonic or subharmonic.</p><p>&gt; Also, the fact that &lt; and &gt; are mathematical symbols, gave<br/>&gt; them a relationship to the use of + and -, so to me it made<br/>&gt; a lot of sense to employ them.</p><p>Sure.</p><p>&gt; (And in case anyone missed it, I&apos;ll reiterate here that<br/>&gt; &lt; and &gt; were the symbols Schoenberg experimentally chose<br/>&gt; to indicate 1/4-tones around 1908-9.)</p><p>A good reason _not_ to use them for 1/6-tones, I should think.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Monz has chosen to use &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot; for these. It&apos;s difficult<br/>&gt; &gt; to remember which is up and which is down. Even Monz himself<br/>&gt; &gt; got these swapped around on an early Miracle lattice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey, it can happen to anyone at any time... simple human<br/>&gt; capacity for error.</p><p>Exactly! No-one&apos;s blaming you. I&apos;m blaming the symbols for making such an<br/>error more likely. It would never have happened with &quot;#&quot; and &quot;b&quot; or &quot;^&quot; and<br/>&quot;v&quot;. Would it?</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t find it difficult at all to<br/>&gt; remember, because a long time ago I learned in school that<br/>&gt; &quot;&lt;&quot; = *L*ess than, and &quot;&lt;&quot; looks a little like an &quot;L&quot;.</p><p>Sure, but I hope you&apos;re not suggesting these be used on actual scores. The<br/>symbols need to be quite distinct so as to reduce the possibility of error<br/>to an absolute minimum. To a musician reading a score, up and down have a<br/>clear relationship to pitch, left and right do not, they relate to time.</p><p>&gt; &gt; But unless anyone can suggest something better to represent<br/>&gt; &gt; the Sims half-arrows, I guess we&apos;ll stick with them. At least<br/>&gt; &gt; they are visually bigger than the &quot;^&quot; and &quot;v&quot; for +-1 step.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hurrah!

If<br/>it is used by Arabic musicians, that probably makes it more common than<br/>anything else under discussion.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have to say, it seems pretty dumb on Sims part, to use a half<br/>&gt; &gt; arrow to designate _twice_ the shift designated by a full-arrow.<br/>&gt; &gt; Shouldn&apos;t it have been the other way around.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That makes sense...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is it really too late. We certainly couldn&apos;t swap their usage.</p><p>Yes, if they&apos;ve been training musicians and getting performances, they<br/>have priority.  It is a shame they chose to do so with such a strange<br/>system.</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt;Or maybe use an arrow with a double-barbed head (one head under the<br/>&gt; &gt; other) instead of half a head. But everyone keeps telling me we&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; stuck with the Sims glyphs. So on we march.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It rather seems that way... Paul Erlich believes this, and there is<br/>&gt; &gt; going to be someone from the Boston Microtonal Society (hopefully)<br/>&gt; &gt; expressing HIS opinion about this on the list...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I look forward to that. Fortunately a 1/6-tone symbol isn&apos;t really<br/>&gt; needed,<br/>&gt; but I still propose double-barbed arrows rather than half arrows. e.g.<br/>&gt;   .<br/>&gt;  /|\       |<br/>&gt; / | \      |<br/>&gt;  /|\     \ | /<br/>&gt; / | \     \|/<br/>&gt;   |      \ | /<br/>&gt;   |       \|/<br/>&gt;            &apos;</p><p>They look kind of like half-sharps as well, which might be a good thing.</p><p>&gt; which we could ASCIIfy unambiguously as ^^ and vv. Maybe they are a bit<br/>&gt; tedious for handwritten scores, but as I say, you don&apos;t need them very<br/>&gt; often</p><p>Don&apos;t like that Asciification.  It makes them look like two dieses when<br/>they should be two commas.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Maybe that one needs some more thinking... I would tend to go with<br/>&gt; &gt; Manuel&apos;s | and ; ... now that I understand them...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok. Excellent. That&apos;s fine with me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Maybe one could even put a &quot;+&quot; in FRONT of the &quot;|&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Like this:  +|<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hmm. I don&apos;t like it, given that the &quot;+&quot; has already been used on its<br/>&gt; own.<br/>&gt; Best to avoid multiple characters for a single symbol if possible. The<br/>&gt; &quot;^^&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;vv&quot; as proposed above, work as two-character symbols because they<br/>&gt; have<br/>&gt; the same meaning as the single character symbol applied twice.</p><p>I think + would do for half-sharp.  It looks like half a # and is similar<br/>to the Tartini symbol.  I&apos;d give it first refusal for use of +.  | and ;<br/>look like line noise to me, and | is also really difficult to get on my<br/>Revo.</p><p>&gt; By the way, I would never use | and ; (1/4 tone shifts) in combination<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; # and b. I see these four symbols as forming a mutually exclusive set,<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; be modified by the other accidentals. So there is a sense in which we<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; going 12-tET -&gt; 24-EDO -&gt; 72-EDO.</p><p>You mean you wouldn&apos;t use a 1.5-sharp symbol, or you wouldn&apos;t mix # and b<br/>with | and ; on the same page?</p><p>&gt; Graham, One thing I forgot to mention before. Whatever ASCII (or real)<br/>&gt; symbol we decide on for 1/6 tones, it would be good if we could use the<br/>&gt; same symbol for the chromatic shift in the decimal notation. This might<br/>&gt; mean using Sims half-arrows for it in &quot;real&quot; scores (or in typesetting<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; Miracle paper).</p><p>The half-arrows look okay to me.  I don&apos;t know how strict the font is --<br/>I&apos;d prefer bigger heads and smaller shafts.  Then they&apos;d be similar to ^<br/>and v anyway.  If performers are okay with them I&apos;ll back off, but I&apos;d<br/>rather they mistook a half-arrow for a full-arrow than a half-arrow going<br/>the other way.</p><p>For now, I&apos;ve updated<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/miracle/conversion.html">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/miracle/conversion.html</a>&gt; with the<br/>Tartini-esque meantone, and also to include Dave&apos;s alpha-decimal and the<br/>current Monzo-72.</p><p>Dave, I think the meantone agrees with you and the 72-equal mapping<br/>agrees too.

Touma<br/>says they are the standard way of writing Arabic scales in adapted staff<br/>notation.  But I don&apos;t have any other sources for that.  It probably<br/>depends on how often Arabic musicians choose to use adapted staff<br/>notation.</p><p>As for the Unicode committee, I don&apos;t think they knew anything about it.<br/>The brief was for Western notation.  Whatever that might mean, it would<br/>probably exclude Arabic.  They did a good job of the character set in<br/>general (at least to my uneducated eye), obviously consulted some music<br/>publishers and early music specialists.  But the fact Arabic music is so<br/>rarely mentioned in general discussions of quarter tones shows there is a<br/>cultural divide here.  Also, Unicode is intended to allow characters to be<br/>viewed differently in different fonts.  A lot of arguments about Han<br/>unification hinge on this point.  So there&apos;s no need for an &quot;Arabic<br/>quarter tone flat&quot; because the usual quarter tone flat will be rendered<br/>correctly in an Arabic music font.</p><p>Obviously somebody must have had some idea about quarter tones and<br/>comma(?) shifts for those characters to be included.  But the glyphs<br/>clearly weren&apos;t designed by tuning specialists.  I reckon they must have<br/>adapted the font from a score editor, or even a commercial font from a<br/>company that had nothing to do with music.  So somebody went down the<br/>list, and came to the accidentals, and thought &quot;sharp up????&quot;  So they<br/>added the arrows, and botched the quarter tones, never having seen a<br/>half-sharp in the wild...</p><p>I think the musical symbols are newly added to the standard, so perhaps<br/>the example glyphs will improve in a later revision.  That&apos;s one reason I<br/>mentioned it here: if anybody thinks they could do better, they might be<br/>right.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, this won&apos;t work for 72-equal.

Not the<br/>same bit<br/>&gt; that gets rubbed out in any other notation, but it makes sense in<br/>and of<br/>&gt; itself.</p><p>Yes. I could get used to it. But here&apos;s another proposal for half-flat<br/>and half-sharp that avoids using alphabetic characters. &quot;&amp;&quot; and &quot;$&quot;.<br/>It&apos;s obvious which is which, isn&apos;t it? Consider the sequence.</p><p>Cb C&amp; C C$ C#</p><p>The ampersand &quot;&amp;&quot; looks a bit like a backwards flat, and if you squint<br/>a bit harder you can even convince yourself that it looks a bit like<br/>Sims&apos; square-root sign (at least it has the flag at the top going to<br/>the right). It&apos;s a fully connected character and doesn&apos;t look like<br/>line noise.</p><p>The dollar sign &quot;$&quot; looks like a Tartini/Arabic half-sharp if you<br/>ignore the fact that it has 3 crossings of the vertical rather than<br/>two, and it looks like an &quot;S&quot; for &quot;sharp&quot; cut in half by a vertical<br/>line. It isn&apos;t as ambiguous as the vertical bar &quot;|&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I really like the systematic [UNICODE example] glyphs for<br/>&gt; &gt; FLAT UP<br/>&gt; &gt; FLAT DOWN<br/>&gt; &gt; NATURAL UP<br/>&gt; &gt; NATURAL DOWN<br/>&gt; &gt; SHARP UP<br/>&gt; &gt; SHARP DOWN<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Adding arrows to the tops and bottoms of the ordinary symbols is a<br/>&gt; &gt; great idea. The meaning is immediately obvious.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you squint, or make the font sufficiently large.  I can easily<br/>see<br/>&gt; these being missed on a score.</p><p>Ah yes. I thought that too. I forgot to say that I would make their<br/>arrow heads a lot bigger than in their example glyphs.</p><p>&gt; So there&apos;s no need for an &quot;Arabic<br/>&gt; quarter tone flat&quot; because the usual quarter tone flat will be<br/>rendered<br/>&gt; correctly in an Arabic music font.</p><p>Right, but I simply wondered why they didn&apos;t use them as the example<br/>quartertone glyphs instead of inventing those silly new ones.</p><p>&gt; So somebody went down<br/>the<br/>&gt; list, and came to the accidentals, and thought &quot;sharp up????&quot;  So<br/>they<br/>&gt; added the arrows, and botched the quarter tones, never having seen a<br/>&gt; half-sharp in the wild...</p><p>Probably.</p><p>&gt; I think the musical symbols are newly added to the standard, so<br/>perhaps<br/>&gt; the example glyphs will improve in a later revision.
