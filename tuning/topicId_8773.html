Don&apos;t be bored, be fascinated, mesmerized. This<br/>&gt; sensibility opens the door for the more complex symmetrical forces<br/>&gt; hidden inside the Trojan horse of equal temperament.&quot;<br/>&gt;</p><p>This quote hit me when it was first posted. Oddly enough, it is the<br/>same thing that has pushed my experimentation into looking at new<br/>temperments rather than collections of pitches (where JI was trying<br/>to take me). Even in 12-out-of-N tunings, some of those log relations<br/>DO reach into the ear to say something like &quot;there is a system going<br/>on here&quot;. Of course, there is no difference between 12-out-of-1200 and<br/>a 12 tone JI arrangement in my experiments... but I believe for<br/>&apos;reasonable&apos; numbers of notes (19, 31, 22) that the &quot;log magic&quot;<br/>holds (somehow).</p><p>Jerry, thanks for responding to my melodic questions, seconds<br/>puzzle me since all this tuning talk is harmony oriented and most<br/>music is more concerned with melody and most meldy moves in seconds.</p><p>...then Jerry said...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tonal music, in general, seems universal and probably predates God (at least<br/>&gt; man&apos;s concept of him/her). At the change of the millennium, polyphony was<br/>&gt; introduced in Western music, however it was still largely vocal,</p><p>I&apos;m surprised this wasn&apos;t slammed harder than it was, what a well-behaved<br/>list. Tonal music, as in major/minor, is a minority of the music in the<br/>world. Even modal music based on the ratios adopted by the tonal West (3<br/>and 5 limit) seems to be ignored or side-stepped in many cultures. Paul<br/>mentioned Arab music and its a great example where some rather<br/>spicy ratios are preferred to those which were eventually turned into<br/>tonal music. (Thirds seconds and sixths seems to come from different pockets<br/>than the ones we use altogether). The Mysterious Voices of the Balkans<br/>recordings have some too, since harmonizing in seconds is just the way<br/>they like it.  Then there are EDOs which have little to do with temperring<br/>the same ratios the West has tempered, 5 and 7 come to mind for Africa?<br/>Thailand?</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=8784 href="#8784">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

Thailand uses 7-tET for its modulational properties; African<br/>examples of 5 and 7 often approach rough equality due to a desire for<br/>melodic smoothness but the &quot;ET&quot; or &quot;EDO&quot; label doesn&apos;t really seem<br/>appropriate.</p></div>
