Just tuning<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt; Hi Jon,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I do only speak English - having seen no real need<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; (as yet) to learn another language. May I enquire<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; as to why you asked? :)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Absolutely. You are approaching music in the same<br/>&gt; &gt; way as language: you see no need for anything else.<br/>&gt; &gt; In doing so, you are making a critical error, one that<br/>&gt; &gt; I attribute to youth, inexperience, hubris, or simple<br/>&gt; &gt; human nature - one size does not fit all.<br/>&gt; &gt; There are centuries of writings in other languages that<br/>&gt; &gt; were written by authors speaking their native tongue.<br/>&gt; &gt; And there are endless pieces of prose and poetry<br/>&gt; &gt; that [would lose] all their charm, passion, anger,<br/>&gt; &gt; intent, thrust if translated into another language<br/>&gt; &gt; (such as English).  If you haven&apos;t travelled to<br/>&gt; &gt; &apos;foreign lands&apos;, then you haven&apos;t experiences -<br/>&gt; &gt; first hand - the reality of &quot;it must lose something<br/>&gt; &gt; in the translation&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I readily admit to certain aspects in other languages<br/>&gt; being preferable to English. What one appreciates in<br/>&gt; each language is all the different tones and forms of<br/>&gt; expression. Even the subtleties in the pronounciation<br/>&gt; of words are obviously more than just trivial.</p><p>the point is: it&apos;s not a matter of something being<br/>*preferable* in any particular language, it&apos;s that one<br/>particular language *may not even be able to express<br/>a concept* which is expressible in a different language.</p><p>if you decide to study French, Spanish, German, or<br/>Russian as a foreign language, you still may not get<br/>so much of a sense of this, because those are all<br/>Indo-European languages which are closely or distantly<br/>related to English.</p><p>but try grasping how Arabic, Japanese, Swahili, or<br/>Navajo work, and you&apos;ll begin to understand what i&apos;m saying.</p><p>each language family (which may contain anywhere from one<br/>individual to several thousand different languages) has<br/>its own particular way of comprehending and describing the<br/>universe.  any two of them may have so little in common<br/>that learning a new one which is vastly different from<br/>the one you already know may entail a comprehensive<br/>retooling of your entire thought process.</p><p>to give one example:  the Indo-European language family<br/>(and probably several others) quantizes the visible color<br/>spectrum into 7 basic categories ordered along a continuum:<br/>red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.  of<br/>course there are lots of adjectives which describe the<br/>colors which fall in between these, but those are the<br/>basic ones.  in contrast, there is a Native American language<br/>of the northwest USA (i forget which language it is) which<br/>breaks the entire spectrum of colors down into only 3<br/>categories, roughly analogous to red-orange, yellow-green,<br/>and blue-indigo-violet.  that is a fundamentally different<br/>way of perceiving the universe, something that goes way<br/>beyond &quot;forms of expression&quot;.</p><p>i&apos;m pretty sure that getting you to understand this is<br/>what Jon was getting at.
