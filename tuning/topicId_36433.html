We are not always aware of our assumptions--the ideas<br/>that cause us to &quot;see&quot; things one way or the other. That&apos;s why we try to<br/>objectify our premises in order to validate conclusions. It doesn&apos;t always<br/>work, however, as we certainly have seen in this exchange. I haven&apos;t<br/>challenged your logic here because I can&apos;t be sure of your assumptions.<br/>However, it seems quite obvious that your emotional defense of Bob is<br/>certainly a strong &quot;value&quot; in the mix. (I considered that out *logically*,<br/>by the way. Want to change my assumption? Figure out how do accomplish<br/>that.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; By the way, where is your response to my post stating that I was able to<br/>&gt;&gt; *predict* what I would hear in jerry10 by alternating between two different<br/>&gt;&gt; perceptual focuses? Don&apos;t you think that&apos;s important?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes.</p><p>Okay. I&apos;m listening.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I think it&apos;s<br/>&gt;&gt; *enormously* important. Isn&apos;t it *logically* possible that Bob (given his<br/>&gt;&gt; own statements about &quot;casual&quot; and &quot;practiced&quot; perceptions) had done the same<br/>&gt;&gt; thing (whether he thought so or not)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; yes, that&apos;s possible.</p><p>Still listening.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; To my *logic*, it seems highly likely.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; perhaps. however, this particular point seems a rather *small* facet<br/>&gt; of an already *small* subset of the phenomena that could be remarked<br/>&gt; upon based on the jerry examples.</p><p>Which point is that? Logic or Bob&apos;s statement? Why &quot;small&quot;? I think that the<br/>fact that Bob and I seem to have experienced the same (or similar)<br/>phenomenon seems rather *large* to me. He and I appear to be the most<br/>experienced people here in regard to choral tuning. If you would get past<br/>the stance of defending his *words*, you might actually understand what I am<br/>saying in that regard. The fact that you belittle this idea is significant.<br/>Until you broaden your scope, your input here is quite worthless.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Bob might have responded very early by saying, &quot;I understand the source of<br/>&gt;&gt; your question, Jerry, but here is why I think your query is off the mark.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; Instead, I got the defensive nonsense (to me) about my &quot;challenge&quot; of the<br/>&gt;&gt; naked JI third in jerry00 being heard as &quot;flat.&quot; My concerns were not<br/>&gt;&gt; challenging that possibility, simply pointing out that, when taken as a<br/>&gt;&gt; whole, Bob&apos;s &quot;flat&quot; report didn&apos;t seem to make as much sense to me as<br/>&gt;&gt; considering the JI triad third to be &quot;high&quot; in contrast to it. At that<br/>&gt;&gt; point, you simply said I was being &quot;illogical&quot; and ignored my reasons *why*<br/>&gt;&gt; I posed this possibility?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; correct. the only way such a claim on your part would be *meaningful*<br/>&gt; is if there were some objective experimental test which would<br/>&gt; ascertain which of the two possibilities in question was the correct<br/>&gt; one.</p><p>We&apos;re not at that point, Paul. We&apos;re simply trying to determine what Bob and<br/>I have in common in regard to hearing jerry00. Why not deal with that<br/>(without challenging my logic)?</p><p>Now, what &quot;two possibilities&quot; are in question? Does that indicate that you<br/>are more concerned with &quot;who wins&quot; or with what seems to be happening here?<br/>Take a long look in the mirror, Paul. Who do you see....defender or<br/>inquisitor?</p><p>&gt; however, there is no possibility in practice of ever comparing<br/>&gt; objective frequency with subjective pitch -- one can only compare<br/>&gt; objective frequency with objective frequency and subjective pitch<br/>&gt; with subjective pitch.</p><p>For the last week or more, I have spent *hours* demonstrating to you I have<br/>no problem with that idea. Why do you insist on harping on it?????</p><p>&gt; therefore, on a scientific basis, making<br/>&gt; either such a judgment as you would try to make above, or even the<br/>&gt; exact opposite of such a judgment (which is how you, unfairly, framed<br/>&gt; bob&apos;s own view), *meaningless*, and *neither* can serve as the<br/>&gt; foundation for further putative scientific explanations.</p><p>Whether or not my view of Bob&apos;s report of his perceptions are &quot;fair,&quot; they<br/>are based on *his* statements. When trying to discover a measure of &quot;truth,&quot;<br/>it is certainly appropriate to question someone&apos;s *perception*. You, of all<br/>people, should understand that. I &quot;framed&quot; Bob&apos;s *report* (not his view) as<br/>I suspected it related to my own. His view is his. My view is mine. He<br/>describes his. I describe mine. I think that&apos;s how it works.</p><p>At some point in the future, we can get scientific in the formal sense.<br/>First, we have to formulate a theory. Next, we have do devise appropriate<br/>methods of testing that theory. We&apos;re no where close at the moment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it seems that so far you have not understood this point.</p><p>It seems so far that you have not considered my responses to &quot;this point.&quot;</p><p>&gt; so satisfied<br/>&gt; are you with your &quot;theory&quot;,</p><p>I don&apos;t know that I have a &quot;theory.&quot; If you know what it is, please tell us<br/>all.</p><p>&gt; that you will not take the time to stop<br/>&gt; and think about this objection.</p><p>I&apos;ve spent a week thinking about your &quot;objection.&quot; To me, your &quot;problem&quot;<br/>with my &quot;logic&quot; makes no sense to me. The more you persist in this silly<br/>game, the less confidence I have in your ability to be effective in the<br/>pursuit of the answers we seek. I have no more time to invest in this<br/>nonsense. Please drop it.</p><p>&gt; if you did stop and think about it,<br/>&gt; and understood what motivation was truly behind it (that of hoping to<br/>&gt; frame jerry&apos;s ideas in a logical way), you probably could have come<br/>&gt; up with a *meaningful* theory that reflects your viewpoint by now,<br/>&gt; and we wouldn&apos;t have lost bob.</p><p>What jibberish! You have moved from being the respected &quot;guru&quot; of the Tuning<br/>List to resembling a flailing refugee from simple reason.</p><p>If Bob wants to be lost, he will be lost. That&apos;s his prerogative. As I<br/>understand him, he intends to continue to participate. Why do you think he<br/>is &quot;lost&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; bob and i tried to make the logical point above to you myriad times</p><p>Ask yourself why your &quot;logic&quot; has failed to communicate. The number of<br/>repetitions is meaningless. All it does is infuriate me that you are *not*<br/>listening.</p><p>&gt; but you insisted on intermingling this purely logical point</p><p>If you think your point is &quot;purely logical&quot; you are more na&iuml;ve than I had<br/>imagined.</p><p>&gt; with<br/>&gt; musical preferences bob and i had expressed, and tying it all<br/>&gt; together in a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;</p><p>Clear evidence of your paranoia. (Which, by the way, is an expression of<br/>*values*.)</p><p>&gt; view of our reaction to<br/>&gt; your &quot;theory&quot;.</p><p>For the umpteenth time, I *have* no theory. Why do you insist that I do? Is<br/>this a &quot;straw man&quot; technique of defining an &quot;enemy&quot; in order to show<br/>yourself a superior competitor? As far as I&apos;m concerned, there is no<br/>competition here. As long as you continue this &quot;contest,&quot; there is not<br/>likely to be much light shed here.</p><p>&gt; this was incredibly insulting,</p><p>Why is honest questioning an insult? Only an *illogical* person would think<br/>so. I have already apologized for any lack of diplomacy and tact I might<br/>have exhibited. Shouldn&apos;t that be adequate to get past this illogical<br/>&quot;defense&quot;?</p><p>&gt; and it is completely<br/>&gt; understandable that bob would therefore call into question your<br/>&gt; ability to reason objectively at all, and leave the discussion.</p><p>Given his response, I agree that he was offended. Okay. I apologized for my<br/>aggressive &quot;style.&quot; So now I am &quot;illogical&quot;? I find *that* offensive.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I suggest we focus on the evidence here and forget about the fuss.<br/>&gt;&gt; Please????<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; uh . . . okay. (but focusing on the evidence means using<br/>&gt; scientifically logical reasoning when discussing it.)</p><p>Why not just normal conversational exchange? If something appears illogical,<br/>we can request clarification (in public). Beyond that, there is no hope for<br/>straight ahead honest exchange of ideas.</p><p>If you can drop the silly &quot;logic&quot; thing, I&apos;ll hang out here to find out what<br/>can be learned.

Your suggestion that I don&apos;t &quot;value&quot; logic<br/>is really pretty na&iuml;ve. Your having said that says more about you than about<br/>me. My doctoral committee likely wouldn&apos;t agree with you since they did<br/>grant my degree.

Here&apos;s the crux of the matter. Since you cannot possibly know<br/>all of my assumptions, how can you therefore conclude that my *logic* is<br/>faulty?

If not....I&apos;m outa here!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob:<br/>&gt; Ignoring logic is the whole problem here. Jerry clearly fails to<br/>&gt; value it as evidenced in both his offline and online &quot;arguments&quot;,<br/>&gt; which term, ignoring its vulgar sense, should normally imply the use<br/>&gt; of valid reasoning (good logic).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is nothing &quot;silly&quot; about logic. It is what saves discourse from<br/>&gt; incoherent ramblings that lead nowhere. By contrast, there is a<br/>&gt; lot &quot;silly&quot; about invalid, inconsistent, and circular &quot;logic&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Logic is indeed useless in the abstract, as Jerry points out, that<br/>&gt; is, unless it is applied to substance. However, its valid use can and<br/>&gt; should be assessed independent of substance. Solid substance is<br/>&gt; easily distorted by the use of invalid logic. Reliable conclusions,<br/>&gt; no matter how solid the substance, cannot issue from bad reasoning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The continual careless and insulting assignment of ulterior motives<br/>&gt; to &quot;opponents&quot; (his way of looking at it, not ours), psychobabble,<br/>&gt; and political posturing are not acceptable substitutes for good<br/>&gt; reasoning. Although I, too, am a performer, in this context I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; interested in running for office or playing to the stands. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; interested in the reliable, consistent processing of raw data in the<br/>&gt; service of meaningful results. This is just another way of defining<br/>&gt; logic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yours in good sense (would that it were more common),<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.S. Jerry talks of &quot;logical&quot; perceptions and assumptions. Any<br/>&gt; logical novice knows that there is no &quot;logic&quot; in either perceptions<br/>&gt; or assumptions. They are what the process of reason uses as raw<br/>&gt; materials and are themselves totally devoid of any logic. Logic<br/>&gt; refers ONLY to the process to which these raw materials are subjected<br/>&gt; in order to make clearly explicit their practical implications and<br/>&gt; link observable phenomena with explanatory power.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry has clearly demonstrated with this misuse that he does not even<br/>&gt; understand what logic means, much less how to apply it. His<br/>&gt; insistence on eliminating logic while completely confusing it with<br/>&gt; perceptions and assumptions is tiresome, to put it mildly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe at this point Jerry&apos;s posts online here are sufficiently<br/>&gt; extensive to at least mildly represent what has been going on<br/>&gt; offline. To any clear-headed, well-reasoning reader, the rest should<br/>&gt; be obvious and anything I can add would be redundant. The less clear-<br/>&gt; headed can enjoy empathizing with Jerry, but heaven help them all if<br/>&gt; they disagree, since there can be no recourse but each person&apos;s<br/>&gt; refuge in his/her own sacred &quot;position&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; On 4/15/02 4:11 PM, &quot;tuning@y...&quot; &lt;tuning@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Message: 16<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Date: Mon, 15 Apr 2002 20:38:23 -0000<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;  From: &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: &quot;High third&quot;: Peace, musicmaking, and merriment<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Paul, I read this and almost decided to ignore it.

If you would get past<br/>&gt;&gt; the stance of defending his *words*, you might actually understand what I am<br/>&gt;&gt; saying in that regard. The fact that you belittle this idea is significant.<br/>&gt;&gt; Until you broaden your scope, your input here is quite worthless.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob might have responded very early by saying, &quot;I understand the source of<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your question, Jerry, but here is why I think your query is off the mark.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Instead, I got the defensive nonsense (to me) about my &quot;challenge&quot; of the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; naked JI third in jerry00 being heard as &quot;flat.&quot; My concerns were not<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; challenging that possibility, simply pointing out that, when taken as a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole, Bob&apos;s &quot;flat&quot; report didn&apos;t seem to make as much sense to me as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; considering the JI triad third to be &quot;high&quot; in contrast to it. At that<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; point, you simply said I was being &quot;illogical&quot; and ignored my reasons *why*<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I posed this possibility?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; correct. the only way such a claim on your part would be *meaningful*<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; is if there were some objective experimental test which would<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ascertain which of the two possibilities in question was the correct<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; one.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; We&apos;re not at that point, Paul. We&apos;re simply trying to determine what Bob and<br/>&gt;&gt; I have in common in regard to hearing jerry00. Why not deal with that<br/>&gt;&gt; (without challenging my logic)?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Now, what &quot;two possibilities&quot; are in question? Does that indicate that you<br/>&gt;&gt; are more concerned with &quot;who wins&quot; or with what seems to be happening here?<br/>&gt;&gt; Take a long look in the mirror, Paul. Who do you see....defender or<br/>&gt;&gt; inquisitor?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; however, there is no possibility in practice of ever comparing<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; objective frequency with subjective pitch -- one can only compare<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; objective frequency with objective frequency and subjective pitch<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; with subjective pitch.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; For the last week or more, I have spent *hours* demonstrating to you I have<br/>&gt;&gt; no problem with that idea. Why do you insist on harping on it?????<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore, on a scientific basis, making<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; either such a judgment as you would try to make above, or even the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; exact opposite of such a judgment (which is how you, unfairly, framed<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; bob&apos;s own view), *meaningless*, and *neither* can serve as the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; foundation for further putative scientific explanations.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Whether or not my view of Bob&apos;s report of his perceptions are &quot;fair,&quot; they<br/>&gt;&gt; are based on *his* statements. When trying to discover a measure of &quot;truth,&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; it is certainly appropriate to question someone&apos;s *perception*. You, of all<br/>&gt;&gt; people, should understand that. I &quot;framed&quot; Bob&apos;s *report* (not his view) as<br/>&gt;&gt; I suspected it related to my own. His view is his. My view is mine. He<br/>&gt;&gt; describes his. I describe mine. I think that&apos;s how it works.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; At some point in the future, we can get scientific in the formal sense.<br/>&gt;&gt; First, we have to formulate a theory. Next, we have do devise appropriate<br/>&gt;&gt; methods of testing that theory. We&apos;re no where close at the moment.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; it seems that so far you have not understood this point.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; It seems so far that you have not considered my responses to &quot;this point.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; so satisfied<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; are you with your &quot;theory&quot;,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I don&apos;t know that I have a &quot;theory.&quot; If you know what it is, please tell us<br/>&gt;&gt; all.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; that you will not take the time to stop<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and think about this objection.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;ve spent a week thinking about your &quot;objection.&quot; To me, your &quot;problem&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; with my &quot;logic&quot; makes no sense to me. The more you persist in this silly<br/>&gt;&gt; game, the less confidence I have in your ability to be effective in the<br/>&gt;&gt; pursuit of the answers we seek. I have no more time to invest in this<br/>&gt;&gt; nonsense. Please drop it.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; if you did stop and think about it,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and understood what motivation was truly behind it (that of hoping to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; frame jerry&apos;s ideas in a logical way), you probably could have come<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; up with a *meaningful* theory that reflects your viewpoint by now,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and we wouldn&apos;t have lost bob.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; What jibberish! You have moved from being the respected &quot;guru&quot; of the Tuning<br/>&gt;&gt; List to resembling a flailing refugee from simple reason.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If Bob wants to be lost, he will be lost. That&apos;s his prerogative. As I<br/>&gt;&gt; understand him, he intends to continue to participate. Why do you think he<br/>&gt;&gt; is &quot;lost&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; bob and i tried to make the logical point above to you myriad times<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Ask yourself why your &quot;logic&quot; has failed to communicate. The number of<br/>&gt;&gt; repetitions is meaningless. All it does is infuriate me that you are *not*<br/>&gt;&gt; listening.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; but you insisted on intermingling this purely logical point<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If you think your point is &quot;purely logical&quot; you are more na&iuml;ve than I had<br/>&gt;&gt; imagined.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; with<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; musical preferences bob and i had expressed, and tying it all<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; together in a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Clear evidence of your paranoia. (Which, by the way, is an expression of<br/>&gt;&gt; *values*.)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; view of our reaction to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; your &quot;theory&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; For the umpteenth time, I *have* no theory. Why do you insist that I do? Is<br/>&gt;&gt; this a &quot;straw man&quot; technique of defining an &quot;enemy&quot; in order to show<br/>&gt;&gt; yourself a superior competitor? As far as I&apos;m concerned, there is no<br/>&gt;&gt; competition here. As long as you continue this &quot;contest,&quot; there is not<br/>&gt;&gt; likely to be much light shed here.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; this was incredibly insulting,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Why is honest questioning an insult? Only an *illogical* person would think<br/>&gt;&gt; so. I have already apologized for any lack of diplomacy and tact I might<br/>&gt;&gt; have exhibited. Shouldn&apos;t that be adequate to get past this illogical<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;defense&quot;?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; and it is completely<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; understandable that bob would therefore call into question your<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; ability to reason objectively at all, and leave the discussion.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Given his response, I agree that he was offended. Okay. I apologized for my<br/>&gt;&gt; aggressive &quot;style.&quot; So now I am &quot;illogical&quot;? I find *that* offensive.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I suggest we focus on the evidence here and forget about the fuss.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please????<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; uh . . . okay. (but focusing on the evidence means using<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; scientifically logical reasoning when discussing it.)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Why not just normal conversational exchange?

Beyond that, there is no hope for<br/>&gt;&gt; straight ahead honest exchange of ideas.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If you can drop the silly &quot;logic&quot; thing, I&apos;ll hang out here to find out what<br/>&gt;&gt; can be learned.

In fact, your insistence on logic apart from<br/>assumptions (values)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; is foreign to anything I have ever read or heard of.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i take it you haven&apos;t gotten too deeply involved in any discipline<br/>&gt; &gt; that involves logical argument, then?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul, you can really be a jerk sometimes. Let&apos;s just talk nose to<br/>nose in<br/>&gt; public and let the logic fall where it will.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Try this one for &quot;logical.&quot; If your valid logic is based on<br/>different<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; assumptions than my valid logic, our conclusions are likely to<br/>be different.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; True?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; yes. but i was focusing on _your_ assumptions and _your_<br/>conclusions<br/>&gt; &gt; in this particular debacle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In order to know *all* of my assumptions you would have to be<br/>psychic. I<br/>&gt; have only stated the ones that seemed appropriate to the discussion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, what &quot;conclusions&quot; are you concerned about? That might<br/>be a good<br/>&gt; start. I&apos;m not aware that I stated any.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; In this case, further productive communication is entirely<br/>dependent<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; on checking our assumptions (which are clearly based on values).<br/>So far, you<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; seem to avoid doing that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; what am i avoiding? as i said, my assumptions aren&apos;t even part of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; issue at hand.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, they are. We are not always aware of our assumptions--the<br/>ideas<br/>&gt; that cause us to &quot;see&quot; things one way or the other. That&apos;s why we<br/>try to<br/>&gt; objectify our premises in order to validate conclusions. It doesn&apos;t<br/>always<br/>&gt; work, however, as we certainly have seen in this exchange. I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; challenged your logic here because I can&apos;t be sure of your<br/>assumptions.<br/>&gt; However, it seems quite obvious that your emotional defense of Bob<br/>is<br/>&gt; certainly a strong &quot;value&quot; in the mix. (I considered that out<br/>*logically*,<br/>&gt; by the way. Want to change my assumption? Figure out how do<br/>accomplish<br/>&gt; that.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; By the way, where is your response to my post stating that I was<br/>able to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; *predict* what I would hear in jerry10 by alternating between<br/>two different<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; perceptual focuses? Don&apos;t you think that&apos;s important?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay. I&apos;m listening.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I think it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; *enormously* important. Isn&apos;t it *logically* possible that Bob<br/>(given his<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; own statements about &quot;casual&quot; and &quot;practiced&quot; perceptions) had<br/>done the same<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; thing (whether he thought so or not)?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; yes, that&apos;s possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Still listening.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; To my *logic*, it seems highly likely.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; perhaps. however, this particular point seems a rather *small*<br/>facet<br/>&gt; &gt; of an already *small* subset of the phenomena that could be<br/>remarked<br/>&gt; &gt; upon based on the jerry examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which point is that? Logic or Bob&apos;s statement? Why &quot;small&quot;? I think<br/>that the<br/>&gt; fact that Bob and I seem to have experienced the same (or similar)<br/>&gt; phenomenon seems rather *large* to me. He and I appear to be the<br/>most<br/>&gt; experienced people here in regard to choral tuning. If you would<br/>get past<br/>&gt; the stance of defending his *words*, you might actually understand<br/>what I am<br/>&gt; saying in that regard. The fact that you belittle this idea is<br/>significant.<br/>&gt; Until you broaden your scope, your input here is quite worthless.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Bob might have responded very early by saying, &quot;I understand the<br/>source of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; your question, Jerry, but here is why I think your query is off<br/>the mark.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Instead, I got the defensive nonsense (to me) about<br/>my &quot;challenge&quot; of the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; naked JI third in jerry00 being heard as &quot;flat.&quot; My concerns<br/>were not<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; challenging that possibility, simply pointing out that, when<br/>taken as a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; whole, Bob&apos;s &quot;flat&quot; report didn&apos;t seem to make as much sense to<br/>me as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; considering the JI triad third to be &quot;high&quot; in contrast to it.<br/>At that<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; point, you simply said I was being &quot;illogical&quot; and ignored my<br/>reasons *why*<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I posed this possibility?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; correct. the only way such a claim on your part would be<br/>*meaningful*<br/>&gt; &gt; is if there were some objective experimental test which would<br/>&gt; &gt; ascertain which of the two possibilities in question was the<br/>correct<br/>&gt; &gt; one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;re not at that point, Paul. We&apos;re simply trying to determine<br/>what Bob and<br/>&gt; I have in common in regard to hearing jerry00. Why not deal with<br/>that<br/>&gt; (without challenging my logic)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, what &quot;two possibilities&quot; are in question? Does that indicate<br/>that you<br/>&gt; are more concerned with &quot;who wins&quot; or with what seems to be<br/>happening here?<br/>&gt; Take a long look in the mirror, Paul. Who do you see....defender or<br/>&gt; inquisitor?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; however, there is no possibility in practice of ever comparing<br/>&gt; &gt; objective frequency with subjective pitch -- one can only compare<br/>&gt; &gt; objective frequency with objective frequency and subjective pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; with subjective pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the last week or more, I have spent *hours* demonstrating to<br/>you I have<br/>&gt; no problem with that idea. Why do you insist on harping on it?????<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; therefore, on a scientific basis, making<br/>&gt; &gt; either such a judgment as you would try to make above, or even the<br/>&gt; &gt; exact opposite of such a judgment (which is how you, unfairly,<br/>framed<br/>&gt; &gt; bob&apos;s own view), *meaningless*, and *neither* can serve as the<br/>&gt; &gt; foundation for further putative scientific explanations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whether or not my view of Bob&apos;s report of his perceptions<br/>are &quot;fair,&quot; they<br/>&gt; are based on *his* statements. When trying to discover a measure<br/>of &quot;truth,&quot;<br/>&gt; it is certainly appropriate to question someone&apos;s *perception*.<br/>You, of all<br/>&gt; people, should understand that. I &quot;framed&quot; Bob&apos;s *report* (not his<br/>view) as<br/>&gt; I suspected it related to my own. His view is his. My view is mine.<br/>He<br/>&gt; describes his. I describe mine. I think that&apos;s how it works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At some point in the future, we can get scientific in the formal<br/>sense.<br/>&gt; First, we have to formulate a theory. Next, we have do devise<br/>appropriate<br/>&gt; methods of testing that theory. We&apos;re no where close at the moment.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; it seems that so far you have not understood this point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems so far that you have not considered my responses to &quot;this<br/>point.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; so satisfied<br/>&gt; &gt; are you with your &quot;theory&quot;,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know that I have a &quot;theory.&quot; If you know what it is, please<br/>tell us<br/>&gt; all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; that you will not take the time to stop<br/>&gt; &gt; and think about this objection.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve spent a week thinking about your &quot;objection.&quot; To me,<br/>your &quot;problem&quot;<br/>&gt; with my &quot;logic&quot; makes no sense to me. The more you persist in this<br/>silly<br/>&gt; game, the less confidence I have in your ability to be effective in<br/>the<br/>&gt; pursuit of the answers we seek. I have no more time to invest in<br/>this<br/>&gt; nonsense. Please drop it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; if you did stop and think about it,<br/>&gt; &gt; and understood what motivation was truly behind it (that of<br/>hoping to<br/>&gt; &gt; frame jerry&apos;s ideas in a logical way), you probably could have<br/>come<br/>&gt; &gt; up with a *meaningful* theory that reflects your viewpoint by now,<br/>&gt; &gt; and we wouldn&apos;t have lost bob.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What jibberish! You have moved from being the respected &quot;guru&quot; of<br/>the Tuning<br/>&gt; List to resembling a flailing refugee from simple reason.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If Bob wants to be lost, he will be lost. That&apos;s his prerogative.<br/>As I<br/>&gt; understand him, he intends to continue to participate. Why do you<br/>think he<br/>&gt; is &quot;lost&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; bob and i tried to make the logical point above to you myriad<br/>times<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ask yourself why your &quot;logic&quot; has failed to communicate. The number<br/>of<br/>&gt; repetitions is meaningless. All it does is infuriate me that you<br/>are *not*<br/>&gt; listening.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but you insisted on intermingling this purely logical point<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you think your point is &quot;purely logical&quot; you are more na&iuml;ve<br/>than<br/>I had<br/>&gt; imagined.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; musical preferences bob and i had expressed, and tying it all<br/>&gt; &gt; together in a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Clear evidence of your paranoia. (Which, by the way, is an<br/>expression of<br/>&gt; *values*.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; view of our reaction to<br/>&gt; &gt; your &quot;theory&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the umpteenth time, I *have* no theory. Why do you insist that<br/>I do? Is<br/>&gt; this a &quot;straw man&quot; technique of defining an &quot;enemy&quot; in order to show<br/>&gt; yourself a superior competitor? As far as I&apos;m concerned, there is no<br/>&gt; competition here. As long as you continue this &quot;contest,&quot; there is<br/>not<br/>&gt; likely to be much light shed here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; this was incredibly insulting,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why is honest questioning an insult? Only an *illogical* person<br/>would think<br/>&gt; so. I have already apologized for any lack of diplomacy and tact I<br/>might<br/>&gt; have exhibited. Shouldn&apos;t that be adequate to get past this<br/>illogical<br/>&gt; &quot;defense&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and it is completely<br/>&gt; &gt; understandable that bob would therefore call into question your<br/>&gt; &gt; ability to reason objectively at all, and leave the discussion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Given his response, I agree that he was offended. Okay. I<br/>apologized for my<br/>&gt; aggressive &quot;style.&quot; So now I am &quot;illogical&quot;? I find *that*<br/>offensive.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I suggest we focus on the evidence here and forget about the<br/>fuss.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Please????<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; uh . . . okay. (but focusing on the evidence means using<br/>&gt; &gt; scientifically logical reasoning when discussing it.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why not just normal conversational exchange?

I don&apos;t think weeks of discussion constitutes &quot;ignoring<br/>completely.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry resumes:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Instead, I got the defensive nonsense (to me) about my &quot;challenge&quot; of the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; naked JI third in jerry00 being heard as &quot;flat.&quot; My concerns were not<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;challenging that possibility, simply pointing out that, when taken as a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole, Bob&apos;s &quot;flat&quot; report didn&apos;t seem to make as much sense to me as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; considering the JI triad third to be &quot;high&quot; in contrast to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob:<br/>&gt; If Jack is taller than Jill, then Jill is shorter than Jack. These<br/>&gt; are logically equivalent statements, so what difference does it make?<br/>&gt; One implies the other. Two different conditions cause us to perceive<br/>&gt; the same frequency as two different pitches.</p><p>If Jack and Jill both measure the same height (physical evidence), yet Jack<br/>seems to appear taller than Jill (perceptual evidence), or vice versa, there<br/>must be something going on with the perception, perhaps an illusion of some<br/>sort.</p><p>The illusion is either in the perception of Jack&apos;s height or in the<br/>perception of Jill&apos;s height, or perhaps both. Suppose we have evidence that<br/>some people see men as taller than objectively measured, but no evidence<br/>that anyone sees women as shorter than objectively measured. Logically, the<br/>illusion is more likely in the perception of men&apos;s height.</p><p>*That&apos;s* the difference it makes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why care which pitch we start with as long as we recognize that it is<br/>&gt; pitch that we perceive differently and that the embedded pitch is<br/>&gt; higher than the stand-alone and the stand-alone by clear implication<br/>&gt; is therefore lower than the higher? Why should you turn my choice of<br/>&gt; this latter equivalent into a &quot;challenge&quot;?</p><p>Your report on jerry00 was apparently based on your confidence that the<br/>embedded pitch was JI (likely based on its lack of beating) and therefore<br/>the naked pitch appeared to be lower than JI. A reasonable conclusion, by<br/>the way, assuming your assumptions are correct.</p><p>Since you didn&apos;t know what the frequencies were before you went on record,<br/>and because you were certain that the embedded third was JI, your report was<br/>quite logical--but only if you ignore your statement of having previously<br/>experienced the high third.</p><p>You had commented to Joe (I believe) that you *had* experienced the high<br/>third but, through practice, had learned to ignore it. Therefore, I<br/>considered that your report of hearing the naked third lower might evidence<br/>your having heard the embedded pitch as the illusionary one (as some of us<br/>had done) and the naked one as JI. Since you seemed to consider hearing the<br/>high third as an anomaly, I suspected that you may not take kindly to the<br/>suggestion that your report may not fully consider all of the factors. In<br/>the interest of exploring the matter, I inquired anyway. (Fools walk in....)</p><p>Since you are an experienced choral director, and because of your confidence<br/>regarding your ability to hear a JI third &quot;in the clear,&quot; I thought it more<br/>likely that you would hear the naked third as an accurate &quot;pitch/frequency<br/>correlation&quot; (to use your term) than the embedded one (which appears to be<br/>subject to the illusion).</p><p>Paul jumped on my &quot;illogical&quot; premise that one could not perceive the naked<br/>third as JI because it was not sounding against another tone. I told him<br/>that I had little difficulty hearing the pitch as JI in jerry00, just as I<br/>would in a melodic context. (I suspect Bob can do this as well.) Paul<br/>wouldn&apos;t hear of it. To him, I was simply being illogical and confusing<br/>frequency with pitch. I assured him I was not, but he preferred to tell me I<br/>know nothing of scientific thinking.</p><p>I asked you whether you might reconsider your conclusion about the naked<br/>third appearing lower than JI, and to consider that the difference may be<br/>due to hearing a &quot;known&quot; phenomenon. You took my asking as an affront to<br/>your integrity. *That* was the beginning of the end.</p><p>Paul quickly came to your rescue with arguments that you also heard the<br/>naked third lower in the other jerries. However, in order to make that stick<br/>he had to ignore your report that the difference was &quot;fuzzy&quot; in the others<br/>and nowhere as pronounced as in jerry00.</p><p>He also insisted that I didn&apos;t know the difference between physical evidence<br/>and perception, and therefore my &quot;logic&quot; was faulty. I assured him that his<br/>fears were unfounded, and demonstrated that I clearly understood the<br/>procedures of scientific discussion and research methods.</p><p>When Paul continued his insistence that my logic was faulty, even when I<br/>pointed out to him that in order to do that he must first examine my<br/>assumptions and premises, I considered that (1) he felt defending you was<br/>more important than examining my assumptions, (2) he had not seriously<br/>considered my stated reasons for questioning your report, or (3) that Paul<br/>was not quite as brilliant as I had previously thought. I&apos;m still weighing<br/>these possibilities as we speak. (My respect is still there, Paul. Its just<br/>bent a bit.)</p><p>At this point, I don&apos;t think there is a chance in hell that you will even<br/>consider the merits of my questioning your report. So long as you consider<br/>your report as the *only* logical explanation, that is where you will<br/>remain. Please understand that I respect your right to believe whatever you<br/>believe (call them values, assumptions, integrity, or whatever). I&apos;ll do the<br/>same. My questioning your report was not intended to question your sincerity<br/>or honesty. It is very unfortunate for this discussion that you seem to have<br/>assumed that.</p><p>&gt; But don&apos;t turn a pitch perception that changes with context by your<br/>&gt; own admission into an objective frequency, and then argue that you<br/>&gt; are hearing a higher frequency, when in fact the frequency does not<br/>&gt; change.<br/>&gt;<br/>You seem to *want* to perpetuate this myth that I don&apos;t know the difference.<br/>*Why* is that, do you think?</p><p>&gt; Jerry later:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I suggest we focus on the evidence here and forget about the fuss.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please????<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul replied:<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; uh . . . okay. (but focusing on the evidence means using<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; scientifically logical reasoning when discussing it.)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry replied:<br/>&gt;&gt; Why not just normal conversational exchange? If something appears illogical,<br/>&gt;&gt; we can request clarification (in public). Beyond that, there is no hope for<br/>&gt;&gt; straight ahead honest exchange of ideas.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If you can drop the silly &quot;logic&quot; thing, I&apos;ll hang out here to find out what<br/>&gt;&gt; can be learned. If not....I&apos;m outa here!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob:<br/>&gt; Ignoring logic is the whole problem here. Jerry clearly fails to<br/>&gt; value it as evidenced in both his offline and online &quot;arguments&quot;,<br/>&gt; which term, ignoring its vulgar sense, should normally imply the use<br/>&gt; of valid reasoning (good logic).</p><p>No one here is *ignoring* logic. What an asinine thing to say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There is nothing &quot;silly&quot; about logic. It is what saves discourse from<br/>&gt; incoherent ramblings that lead nowhere. By contrast, there is a<br/>&gt; lot &quot;silly&quot; about invalid, inconsistent, and circular &quot;logic&quot;.</p><p>I think impassioned defensive behavior is more likely to result in poor<br/>reasoning, for example this tirade about faulty logic without examining<br/>assumptions and premises.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Logic is indeed useless in the abstract, as Jerry points out, that<br/>&gt; is, unless it is applied to substance. However, its valid use can and<br/>&gt; should be assessed independent of substance. Solid substance is<br/>&gt; easily distorted by the use of invalid logic. Reliable conclusions,<br/>&gt; no matter how solid the substance, cannot issue from bad reasoning.</p><p>Hallelujah! At last....some reason. Good paragraph, Bob. Now will you apply<br/>these values to my paragraphs above and tell me where my logic has distorted<br/>substance. Frankly, I would think my premises are far more fragile than my<br/>logic, but have at it if you like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The continual careless and insulting assignment of ulterior motives<br/>&gt; to &quot;opponents&quot; (his way of looking at it, not ours),</p><p>Are you sure???</p><p>&gt; psychobabble,<br/>&gt; and political posturing are not acceptable substitutes for good<br/>&gt; reasoning.</p><p>Then why are you doing it?</p><p>&gt; Although I, too, am a performer, in this context I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; interested in running for office or playing to the stands. I&apos;m<br/>&gt; interested in the reliable, consistent processing of raw data in the<br/>&gt; service of meaningful results.</p><p>Then why didn&apos;t you take my questioning of your report on jerry00 as an<br/>expression of *my* interest in &quot;reliable, consistent processing of raw data<br/>in the service of meaningful results&quot;? That was the spirit in which it was<br/>offered.</p><p>&gt; This is just another way of defining logic.</p><p>In a way, yes. However, the difficulties we are having here have more to do<br/>with identifying the raw date than with processing it. And, as I said above,<br/>*your* &quot;raw data&quot; was not described by you as the same &quot;raw data&quot; as what I<br/>observed and described.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yours in good sense (would that it were more common),</p><p>Does that imply that your thinking is usually flawless? If so, tell me how<br/>you do it and I&apos;ll aspire to think on your level when I grow up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; P.S. Jerry talks of &quot;logical&quot; perceptions and assumptions. Any<br/>&gt; logical novice knows that there is no &quot;logic&quot; in either perceptions<br/>&gt; or assumptions. They are what the process of reason uses as raw<br/>&gt; materials and are themselves totally devoid of any logic. Logic<br/>&gt; refers ONLY to the process to which these raw materials are subjected<br/>&gt; in order to make clearly explicit their practical implications and<br/>&gt; link observable phenomena with explanatory power.</p><p>Very nicely stated, Bob. Except that &quot;raw material&quot; is commonly processed by<br/>*inductive&quot; reasoning (a kind of logic) which leads to the premises that<br/>*deductive* reasoning (the kind of logic you are talking about here, I<br/>presume) then uses to reach conclusions (or theories).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jerry has clearly demonstrated with this misuse that he does not even<br/>&gt; understand what logic means, much less how to apply it. His<br/>&gt; insistence on eliminating logic while completely confusing it with<br/>&gt; perceptions and assumptions is tiresome, to put it mildly.</p><p>I think my preceding paragraph suggests that I might have some clue<br/>regarding logic and scientific method. It appears, Bob, that you have<br/>created a &quot;straw man&quot; in order to demonstrate your logical superiority. In<br/>the process, I think you have likely demonstrated that you are something<br/>other than that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe at this point Jerry&apos;s posts online here are sufficiently<br/>&gt; extensive to at least mildly represent what has been going on<br/>&gt; offline. To any clear-headed, well-reasoning reader, the rest should<br/>&gt; be obvious and anything I can add would be redundant. The less clear-<br/>&gt; headed can enjoy empathizing with Jerry, but heaven help them all if<br/>&gt; they disagree, since there can be no recourse but each person&apos;s<br/>&gt; refuge in his/her own sacred &quot;position&quot;.</p><p>Now that&apos;s what I call a *true* statement. I said offline essentially what I<br/>have said here. And there, as here, the scarcity of clear-headed responses<br/>to my questions has dominated.</p><p>Bob, I thought you said your intention was not to &quot;grandstand.&quot; What do you<br/>call your paragraph above, if not grandstanding? Okay, all you muddle-headed<br/>morons get on my side of the room where we can discuss each other&apos;s &quot;sacred<br/>positions,&quot; provided we are open to benefit from the exchange of experiences<br/>and ideas. No &quot;refuging&quot; allowed (for example, refusing to reconsider a<br/>stated &quot;position&quot;).</p><p>One of the things I said to you offline was that you appear to be a pompous<br/>sort of person. I told you I thought so because when you first re-entered<br/>the list you posted a &quot;this I believe about jazz&quot; position paper (presumably<br/>for my benefit, since you referred to me as &quot;this jazz choir fellow&quot;)<br/>without any idea of what the issues were. Your closing paragraph above<br/>demonstrates, better than anything I could possibly say, that my assessment<br/>was accurate.</p><p>Now, if you will excuse me, Bob, I&apos;ll not spend any more time on this<br/>exchange. If you are helped by it, I&apos;m glad. If not, I&apos;m sorry. But in<br/>either case, I&apos;m *done*.</p><p>Jerry</p></div><h3><a id=36486 href="#36486">ðŸ”—</a>robert_wendell &#x3C;rwendell@cangelic.org&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2002 12:35:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jerry earlier:<br/>In fact, your insistence on logic apart from<br/>&gt; assumptions (values)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is foreign to anything I have ever read or heard of.</p><p>Bob now:<br/>Then I have to question that you have ever really understood anything<br/>you read relating to logic.

I suggested we<br/>drop the<br/>&gt; &quot;logic&quot; bit. Your insistence on perpetuating it is extremely<br/>annoying to me<br/>&gt; (and to others here, I think).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My second thought is to ignore your post is to suggest that I have<br/>no<br/>&gt; answers. Therefore, here goes:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., Gerald Eskelin &lt;stg3music@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Paul, *your* concern with *my* logic seems focused on irrelevant<br/>issues, as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I see it. In fact, your insistence on logic apart from<br/>assumptions (values)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; is foreign to anything I have ever read or heard of.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; i take it you haven&apos;t gotten too deeply involved in any discipline<br/>&gt; &gt; that involves logical argument, then?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul, you can really be a jerk sometimes. Let&apos;s just talk nose to<br/>nose in<br/>&gt; public and let the logic fall where it will.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Try this one for &quot;logical.&quot; If your valid logic is based on<br/>different<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; assumptions than my valid logic, our conclusions are likely to<br/>be different.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; True?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; yes. but i was focusing on _your_ assumptions and _your_<br/>conclusions<br/>&gt; &gt; in this particular debacle.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In order to know *all* of my assumptions you would have to be<br/>psychic. I<br/>&gt; have only stated the ones that seemed appropriate to the discussion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the way, what &quot;conclusions&quot; are you concerned about? That might<br/>be a good<br/>&gt; start. I&apos;m not aware that I stated any.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; In this case, further productive communication is entirely<br/>dependent<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; on checking our assumptions (which are clearly based on values).<br/>So far, you<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; seem to avoid doing that.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; what am i avoiding? as i said, my assumptions aren&apos;t even part of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; issue at hand.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Actually, they are. We are not always aware of our assumptions--the<br/>ideas<br/>&gt; that cause us to &quot;see&quot; things one way or the other. That&apos;s why we<br/>try to<br/>&gt; objectify our premises in order to validate conclusions. It doesn&apos;t<br/>always<br/>&gt; work, however, as we certainly have seen in this exchange. I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; challenged your logic here because I can&apos;t be sure of your<br/>assumptions.<br/>&gt; However, it seems quite obvious that your emotional defense of Bob<br/>is<br/>&gt; certainly a strong &quot;value&quot; in the mix. (I considered that out<br/>*logically*,<br/>&gt; by the way. Want to change my assumption? Figure out how do<br/>accomplish<br/>&gt; that.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; By the way, where is your response to my post stating that I was<br/>able to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; *predict* what I would hear in jerry10 by alternating between<br/>two different<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; perceptual focuses? Don&apos;t you think that&apos;s important?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; yes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay. I&apos;m listening.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I think it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; *enormously* important. Isn&apos;t it *logically* possible that Bob<br/>(given his<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; own statements about &quot;casual&quot; and &quot;practiced&quot; perceptions) had<br/>done the same<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; thing (whether he thought so or not)?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; yes, that&apos;s possible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Still listening.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; To my *logic*, it seems highly likely.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; perhaps. however, this particular point seems a rather *small*<br/>facet<br/>&gt; &gt; of an already *small* subset of the phenomena that could be<br/>remarked<br/>&gt; &gt; upon based on the jerry examples.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which point is that? Logic or Bob&apos;s statement? Why &quot;small&quot;? I think<br/>that the<br/>&gt; fact that Bob and I seem to have experienced the same (or similar)<br/>&gt; phenomenon seems rather *large* to me. He and I appear to be the<br/>most<br/>&gt; experienced people here in regard to choral tuning. If you would<br/>get past<br/>&gt; the stance of defending his *words*, you might actually understand<br/>what I am<br/>&gt; saying in that regard. The fact that you belittle this idea is<br/>significant.<br/>&gt; Until you broaden your scope, your input here is quite worthless.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Bob might have responded very early by saying, &quot;I understand the<br/>source of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; your question, Jerry, but here is why I think your query is off<br/>the mark.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Instead, I got the defensive nonsense (to me) about<br/>my &quot;challenge&quot; of the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; naked JI third in jerry00 being heard as &quot;flat.&quot; My concerns<br/>were not<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; challenging that possibility, simply pointing out that, when<br/>taken as a<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; whole, Bob&apos;s &quot;flat&quot; report didn&apos;t seem to make as much sense to<br/>me as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; considering the JI triad third to be &quot;high&quot; in contrast to it.<br/>At that<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; point, you simply said I was being &quot;illogical&quot; and ignored my<br/>reasons *why*<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I posed this possibility?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; correct. the only way such a claim on your part would be<br/>*meaningful*<br/>&gt; &gt; is if there were some objective experimental test which would<br/>&gt; &gt; ascertain which of the two possibilities in question was the<br/>correct<br/>&gt; &gt; one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We&apos;re not at that point, Paul. We&apos;re simply trying to determine<br/>what Bob and<br/>&gt; I have in common in regard to hearing jerry00. Why not deal with<br/>that<br/>&gt; (without challenging my logic)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, what &quot;two possibilities&quot; are in question? Does that indicate<br/>that you<br/>&gt; are more concerned with &quot;who wins&quot; or with what seems to be<br/>happening here?<br/>&gt; Take a long look in the mirror, Paul. Who do you see....defender or<br/>&gt; inquisitor?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; however, there is no possibility in practice of ever comparing<br/>&gt; &gt; objective frequency with subjective pitch -- one can only compare<br/>&gt; &gt; objective frequency with objective frequency and subjective pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; with subjective pitch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the last week or more, I have spent *hours* demonstrating to<br/>you I have<br/>&gt; no problem with that idea. Why do you insist on harping on it?????<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; therefore, on a scientific basis, making<br/>&gt; &gt; either such a judgment as you would try to make above, or even the<br/>&gt; &gt; exact opposite of such a judgment (which is how you, unfairly,<br/>framed<br/>&gt; &gt; bob&apos;s own view), *meaningless*, and *neither* can serve as the<br/>&gt; &gt; foundation for further putative scientific explanations.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Whether or not my view of Bob&apos;s report of his perceptions<br/>are &quot;fair,&quot; they<br/>&gt; are based on *his* statements. When trying to discover a measure<br/>of &quot;truth,&quot;<br/>&gt; it is certainly appropriate to question someone&apos;s *perception*.<br/>You, of all<br/>&gt; people, should understand that. I &quot;framed&quot; Bob&apos;s *report* (not his<br/>view) as<br/>&gt; I suspected it related to my own. His view is his. My view is mine.<br/>He<br/>&gt; describes his. I describe mine. I think that&apos;s how it works.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At some point in the future, we can get scientific in the formal<br/>sense.<br/>&gt; First, we have to formulate a theory. Next, we have do devise<br/>appropriate<br/>&gt; methods of testing that theory. We&apos;re no where close at the moment.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; it seems that so far you have not understood this point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seems so far that you have not considered my responses to &quot;this<br/>point.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; so satisfied<br/>&gt; &gt; are you with your &quot;theory&quot;,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know that I have a &quot;theory.&quot; If you know what it is, please<br/>tell us<br/>&gt; all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; that you will not take the time to stop<br/>&gt; &gt; and think about this objection.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve spent a week thinking about your &quot;objection.&quot; To me,<br/>your &quot;problem&quot;<br/>&gt; with my &quot;logic&quot; makes no sense to me. The more you persist in this<br/>silly<br/>&gt; game, the less confidence I have in your ability to be effective in<br/>the<br/>&gt; pursuit of the answers we seek. I have no more time to invest in<br/>this<br/>&gt; nonsense. Please drop it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; if you did stop and think about it,<br/>&gt; &gt; and understood what motivation was truly behind it (that of<br/>hoping to<br/>&gt; &gt; frame jerry&apos;s ideas in a logical way), you probably could have<br/>come<br/>&gt; &gt; up with a *meaningful* theory that reflects your viewpoint by now,<br/>&gt; &gt; and we wouldn&apos;t have lost bob.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What jibberish! You have moved from being the respected &quot;guru&quot; of<br/>the Tuning<br/>&gt; List to resembling a flailing refugee from simple reason.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If Bob wants to be lost, he will be lost. That&apos;s his prerogative.<br/>As I<br/>&gt; understand him, he intends to continue to participate. Why do you<br/>think he<br/>&gt; is &quot;lost&quot;?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; bob and i tried to make the logical point above to you myriad<br/>times<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ask yourself why your &quot;logic&quot; has failed to communicate. The number<br/>of<br/>&gt; repetitions is meaningless. All it does is infuriate me that you<br/>are *not*<br/>&gt; listening.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; but you insisted on intermingling this purely logical point<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you think your point is &quot;purely logical&quot; you are more na&iuml;ve than<br/>I had<br/>&gt; imagined.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; musical preferences bob and i had expressed, and tying it all<br/>&gt; &gt; together in a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Clear evidence of your paranoia. (Which, by the way, is an<br/>expression of<br/>&gt; *values*.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; view of our reaction to<br/>&gt; &gt; your &quot;theory&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For the umpteenth time, I *have* no theory. Why do you insist that<br/>I do? Is<br/>&gt; this a &quot;straw man&quot; technique of defining an &quot;enemy&quot; in order to show<br/>&gt; yourself a superior competitor? As far as I&apos;m concerned, there is no<br/>&gt; competition here. As long as you continue this &quot;contest,&quot; there is<br/>not<br/>&gt; likely to be much light shed here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; this was incredibly insulting,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Why is honest questioning an insult? Only an *illogical* person<br/>would think<br/>&gt; so. I have already apologized for any lack of diplomacy and tact I<br/>might<br/>&gt; have exhibited. Shouldn&apos;t that be adequate to get past this<br/>illogical<br/>&gt; &quot;defense&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; and it is completely<br/>&gt; &gt; understandable that bob would therefore call into question your<br/>&gt; &gt; ability to reason objectively at all, and leave the discussion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Given his response, I agree that he was offended. Okay. I<br/>apologized for my<br/>&gt; aggressive &quot;style.&quot; So now I am &quot;illogical&quot;? I find *that*<br/>offensive.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I suggest we focus on the evidence here and forget about the<br/>fuss.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Please????<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; uh . . . okay.
