For a century or so, musicians assumed that it referred to<br/>equal temperament, the modern tuning used by pianists, where every<br/>harmony is just a little out of tune but is equally usable. Then in<br/>the 1970s and 80s, the prevailing view became that it referred to<br/>slightly unequal Baroque temperaments. These, like equal temperament,<br/>allow you to modulate to distant keys without sounding painfully out<br/>of tune, but they also add flavor to the varying keys. Just when a<br/>consensus was forming for this viewpoint, at least one scholar began<br/>to argue that equal temperament was the stronger candidate after all.<br/>But the pendulum seems to have swung away from him. After all, Bach&apos;s<br/>son Carl Philip Emanuel described his dad as &quot;Anti-Rameau&quot; (in other<br/>words, anti-equal-temperament);...</p><p>***does that even refer to the eary Rameau&apos;s alleged brode 5ths?***</p><p>..and Bach was said to tune his own instruments, meaning he didn&apos;t<br/>trust anyone else to do it; he was also said to have tuned his thirds<br/>a little sharp.

Maybe Brad has actually READ some original<br/>17th and 18th century manuscripts instead of relying on some guy from<br/>the middle of the 20th century who thought the history of temperament<br/>was some Gradus ad Parnassum towards the perfection of ET. Maybe Brad<br/>isn&apos;t trying to sweep Werckmeister 1691-V under the rug, which has a<br/>Godzilla-sized (assuming 704 to be wolfish) wide fifth of 708 cents!<br/>Or worse yet, Werckmeister&apos;s 1681-II/1691-IV 1/3 comma temperament,<br/>with TWO (count &apos;em!!) yes, TWO &uuml;ber-nasty wide fifths of -hold onto<br/>your seat, Andreas- 709,8 cents!!!! Although I would tend to agree<br/>with Andreas that fifths tempered by so much (be they wide OR narrow)<br/>are approaching wolf-quality, though probably better to call them mere<br/>cur fifths. Even at the end of the 1690&apos;s, after he&apos;d cleaned up his<br/>act a little, and like Rameau, changed his mind, and starting saying<br/>that anything in the area of 1/4 comma and more was &quot;hideous and<br/>lame&quot;, that poor old sod Werckmeister wasn&apos;t bright enough to figure<br/>out that wide fifths of any stripe are an abomination unto the Lord.<br/>Poor old W, somebody should have given him a copy of Barbour, that<br/>would have set him straight!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Come on Brad, this is barely ridiculous!</p><p>And how!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yours Sincerely amazed about such an stolidity<br/>&gt; A.S.<br/>&gt;<br/>Yours sincerely amazed at such twisting and bending of history.

WIV was no so much  proposed by<br/>Werckmeister, but respectfully included.  The indications are  that WIV<br/>precedes WIII historically.  Trost, who had the organ jobs in both  Quedlinburg and<br/>afterwards, in Halberstadt, was likely using WIV.  Reading  through Muscial<br/>Temperament, Werckmeister speaks for chapters about how an  &quot;unmentioned&quot; organ<br/>tuner favored the Trost method.</p><p>Once WIV/1681-II was used by one of Werckmeister&apos;s sons when he took over<br/>for his father in Quedlinburg.<br/>WV has no historical footprints, nor WVI (however unmusical it is claimed  to<br/>be).</p><p>WIII, however, historically been connected to Werckmeister in largest<br/>proportion, incomparable to any other variant...why?  Simply, it is the  bulk of his<br/>book.  It is the first one listed as correct.  It is the  recommended<br/>chromatic tuning so appropriate for the chromaticist champion, JS  Bach.  It sounds<br/>great for Bach.  It is critical to the keyboard  improvisation in a full circle<br/>required by the likes of Werckmeister (even as  his compositions were in C<br/>major and G major).</p><p>Hope this helps.

So when one begins to open one&apos;s mind to the larger<br/>historical reality, V begins to seem much more &quot;mainstream&quot;. Regarding<br/>its suitabilitiy for &quot;chromatic genera&quot;, the difference is small<br/>between V and III. III actually has a larger number of Pythagorean<br/>major thirds in the distant keys, albeit at a slight improvement in<br/>the thirds in the home keys, but if I had to play in &quot;chromatic&quot;<br/>tonalities I would prefer V.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3>Tom Dent &#x3C;stringph@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2008 9:18:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>What on earth does &apos;fallacy&apos; have to do with &apos;censorship&apos;, please?</p><p>Of course Werckmeister cared about circular temperament.

On the flat side, Georg Bohm calls for a healthy dose<br/>of Gb, Db, and Ab; and on the sharp side he goes all the way up to D#<br/>and A#.  (Sure, on *some* occasions one might retune the harpsichord<br/>to choose different accidentals, according to which piece is going to<br/>be played; but some of the compositions go beyond 12 notes.)</p><p>And, since you brought up Buxtehude, here&apos;s a roster of all of his<br/>extant harpsichord music and the notes these pieces require.  I&apos;m<br/>going straight through Breitkopf 8077 from first page to last:</p><p>C suite 226: Bb to G#<br/>C suite 227: Bb to G#<br/>C suite 228: Bb to G#<br/>C suite 230: Eb to G#<br/>C suite 231: Bb to G#<br/>D suite 232: C to G# +A#<br/>d suite 233: Eb to G#<br/>d suite 234: Eb to G#<br/>e suite 235: F to A#<br/>e suite 236: C to A#<br/>e suite 237: F to A#<br/>F suite 238: Eb to C#<br/>F suite 239: Eb to C#<br/>G suite 240: F to D#<br/>g suite 241: Ab to C#<br/>g suite 242: Ab to C#<br/>A suite 243: G to B#   (yes, B sharp! no surprise in A-major music)<br/>a suite 244: F to D#<br/>C aria/var 246: Bb to D#<br/>C More Palatino 247: Bb to D#<br/>d Rofilis 248: Eb to G#<br/>G La Capricciosa 250: Eb to D#  (yes, both D#/Eb in the same piece)<br/>a Aria/var 249: Bb to D#<br/>a Courante Simple 245: F to D#<br/>d Courante (Anhang 6): Bb to C#<br/>C suite 229 (Lebegue?): Bb to G#<br/>G Simphonie (Anhang 8 - Lebegue?): F to G#</p><p>=====</p><p>As for Bohm, this time in his *organ* pieces (pedaliter music, and<br/>lots of chorale settings and partitas): he occasionally calls for 14<br/>different notes within the same composition.  The C major Praeludium<br/>uses all of Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#.</p><p>Yes, sports fans, both D#/Eb and A#/Bb at different spots within the<br/>same composition.  On organ.  Maybe he had split keys, or maybe he had<br/>an irregular temperament with moderate positions for these.  [And if<br/>it was any tighter than regular 1/6 comma on the naturals, there would<br/>have been one or more wide 5ths somewhere in there around the back;<br/>it&apos;s impossible not to.]</p><p>Bohm&apos;s A minor Praeludium sticks to 12 notes, but it&apos;s Bb up to D#.</p><p>His four-stanza setting of &quot;Auf meinen lieben Gott&quot; (even though there<br/>are &quot;only&quot; two flats in the signature) uses all of<br/>Db-Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#.  Whatever organs he and his students<br/>were playing it on, it had to have a serviceable way to play Db, C#,<br/>and Ab.</p><p>&quot;Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ&quot; goes from Ab up to G#, needing both.</p><p>&quot;Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist&quot; goes from F up to A#.</p><p>&quot;Wer nur den lieben Gott&quot; is in A minor (zero anything in the<br/>signature) but it needs F up to D#.  The occurrence of D# certainly<br/>isn&apos;t rare in *anybody&apos;s* 17th century music in the &quot;simple&quot; key of A<br/>minor; and any music in E minor usually needs both D# and A#.</p><p>Johann Pachelbel&apos;s book of 95 Magnificat-fugues, composed during his<br/>last job (St Sebald, Nuremberg, 1695-1706), needs<br/>Ab-Eb-Bb-F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-D#.  Obviously, most of the flat-side<br/>stuff comes up during the 7th tone pieces (two flats in signature),<br/>and most of the sharp-side stuff during the 4th tone pieces (empty<br/>signature, but E major finals).  Now, what was on *that* organ?  Split<br/>keys on G#/Ab and D#/Eb, or an irregular temperament?</p><p>Some of Pachelbel&apos;s earlier organ music goes farther afield than this,<br/>incidentally, in both directions flatward and sharpward.  Much farther.</p><p>General remark: even if the signatures look very simple at the<br/>beginning of a piece, with two or fewer sharps or flats, the really<br/>important thing to do anyway is to play all the way through each<br/>piece, and jot down which *notes* are required to play the piece.  And<br/>then, figure out a range of historically plausible tuning schemes<br/>within which those notes are available.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2008 3:33:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Wow...I can&apos;t believe this is still a discussion, having ducked out of<br/>it for months!</p><p>Anyway--Johnny--I&apos;m curious--you contend that Buxtehudemighthavehadhis<br/>own special &apos;brew&apos; (tuning)...why not old JS then? :)</p><p>-A.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tom, maybe you have the common fallacy?

I was joking<br/>that I was calling you out on who was indeed caught  in a common fallacy.  I<br/>will now turn serious.</p><p>Tom:  Of course Werckmeister cared about circular  temperament. No-one is<br/>arguing with that. But who are these &apos;people like  Werckmeister&apos;?<br/>Can you show us that there was anyone else &apos;like  Werckmeister&apos;? ...<br/>That is the whole point. One person is not another.</p><p>Johnny:  Yes, of course.  Like Werckmeister,  Buxtehude was more pronounced<br/>as an improviser.  Both composers wrote very  little.  To them, composing was<br/>less a creative achievement than their  ability to sway the audience through a<br/>real time improvisation.   Werckmeister and CPE Bach both wrote of the need<br/>for a circular tuning in  improvisation.  It was not of their choice to<br/>improvise in meantone because  they would have to keep a conscious mental barrier to<br/>prevent the awful  disparity of the wolf.</p><p>There are many scholars that have written of the primacy of  improvisation in<br/>the life of Werckmeister (Lindley, for example), and in  Buxtehude.  The same<br/>might be said today of the Grateful Dead and Charlie  Parker.</p><p>As an improvisor, It is important to limit anything that is  forcibly held in<br/>consciousness during an improvisation, and buddies Buxtehude  and<br/>Werckmeister realized this.  Bach, too.  If you are interested in  this perspective,<br/>certainly no part of any &quot;common&quot; fallacy, I could find some  quotations.</p><p>Tom:  It might help to pay attention to the logical  structure of what I did<br/>say: It remains nonsensical to reason from &apos;X was  friends with Y&apos; to<br/>&apos;X agreed with Y about some aspect of tuning or  temperament&apos;.</p><p>Johnny:  And yet, I just did.  Instead of  condescending, why not reconsider.<br/> I just don&apos;t think you recognize the  priorities of these two friends.<br/>According to Snyder, as I recall,  Buxtehude got his job in Lubeck mainly as an<br/>improviser.   There was little that we could call a great musical composition<br/>until after  he secured the Lubeck job.</p><p>Your equation doesn&apos;t ring true to me because X was friends  with Y for<br/>professional reasons, too.  They supported the same big ideas in  music.  The<br/>historic record provides ample evidence of a need, a  desire, and a determination<br/>to have a circular tuning on the organ for the  primary reason of improvisation<br/>before audiences.  In the age before  recordings, improv was the higher<br/>performance level for these two  organists.</p><p>Tom:  Take the list members. Is it really so impossible  for two people to<br/>remain friends while using completely different tuning  systems?</p><p>Johnny:  Of course, not.  And yet, you see from  what I have written, that<br/>they had a different shop talk as improvisers than  modern musicologists fully<br/>understand.  Snyder is rather honest about being  behind the 8 ball in<br/>understanding the issues of tunings, prominently quoting  Ibo Ortgies.  Yes,<br/>Werckmeister wrote of the requirement of a circle to  improvisation that Buxtehude must<br/>have agreed with because of its clarity of  purpose.  The circle was<br/>necessary for them both, and for the Bachs, as  well, for the same reasons.</p><p>Tom:  Also, I have no idea where you got  the notion that either Buxtehude or<br/>Werckmeister thought one should &apos;use  every key for improvisation<br/>requirements&apos;. Is this in any historical source?</p><p>Johnny:  &ldquo;Legitimate  musicians get more from creating something on the<br/>clavier ex  tempore  than by depending too much on the tablature&rdquo; declared<br/>Werckmeister (Archambault,  &ldquo;Essential  Annotations and Rules Concerning the Proper<br/>Realization of the Basso Continuo or  Thorough-Bass&rdquo; (Die  nothwendigsten<br/>Ammerckungen und Regeln, wie der Bassus continuus oder  General-Bass wohl k&ouml;nne<br/>tractiret warden, p. 259).  This is the same book that includes Buxtehude&apos;s<br/>praise to Werckmeister.</p><p>Tom:  If a player is improvising - ie not bound to any  pre-ordained key or<br/>harmony - why<br/>can&apos;t he just choose to avoid whatever  &apos;bad&apos; intervals exist on the<br/>organ in front of him?</p><p>Johnny:  I truly hope I have moved you  towards understanding this.  An<br/>improviser is bound to a particular  key as soon as it is established with the<br/>first chord(s).  Below is a  swatch from my upcoming book, sans final edits.<br/>(Sorry if their are code  translation problems):</p><p>Michael R. Dodds points out that Werckmeister&rsquo;s Harmonologia musica is a<br/>necessary guide  to recovering the lost art of Baroque improvisation, giving a<br/>healthy number of  examples.  For example, Praeambulum in A Minor, BuxWV 158  &ldquo;<br/>exemplifies the technique of generating an entire improvisatory composition<br/>from a single melodic idea&mdash;in this case a sequential subject of the sort<br/>addressed by Werckmeister&rdquo; (Dodds, p. 12), with supplementing details to  follow.<br/>Additionally, Buxtehude  used Werckmeister&rsquo;s improvisatory principles regarding<br/>sequential subjects in  BuxWV 137, 150, 194, and 203.  The  gist here is that<br/>Buxtehude and Werckmeister were in broad agreement as to the  nitty gritty of<br/>improvising on the organ.  They must have grand get togethers, likely sharing<br/>an organ bench from  time to time.<br/>Dodds describes a fascinating connection  between Andreas Werckmeister and<br/>Dieterich Buxtehude, eight years Werckmeister&rsquo;s  senior, in the process of<br/>keyboard improvisation<br/>In many of his works in improvisatory genres, including  his praembula and<br/>chorale-based  compositions, Buxtehude employs the very techniques described by<br/>his friend  Werckmeister.  At issue is not any  question of influence:<br/>notwithstanding Werckmeister&rsquo;s avowals of originality, it  seems more likely it was<br/>he, an innovative theorist but mediocre composer, who  learned more from the<br/>L&uuml;beck master than vice versa.  Indeed, by the time Werckmeister  published<br/>Harmonologia musica in  1702, the sexagenarian Buxtehude had already composed most<br/>of his organ  works.  Rather, the striking  parallels between Werckmeister&rsquo;s<br/>teachings and Buxtehude&rsquo;s music merit attention  because they constitute<br/>mutually supporting evidence about contrapuntal  improvisation in the Baroque era<br/>(Dodds, pp. 2-3).<br/>As a first rate improviser, Werckmeister signaled  a change with the old<br/>guard in more than simply tuning.  Gioseffe Zarlino&rsquo;s Renaissance rules  wouldn&rsquo;t<br/>work for serious improvisers in Werckmeister&rsquo;s estimation because they  were<br/>too &ldquo;complicated and obscure that one cannot easily in a moment recall  them.<br/>Our rules, however, derive  from the chords, when below and above a third is<br/>always placed, and thus cannot  fail&rdquo; (Dodds, p. 15_[i]_ (#_edn1) ).<br/>Werckmeister promoted the need to not think while improvising, so  Zarlino&rsquo;s time worn<br/>methods needed to be dispensed with.  Werckmeister wrote of using parallel<br/>thirds in both hands that move sequentially in contrasting directions in order<br/>to jumpstart an improvisation.  This  use of parallel thirds is commonly used<br/>in Buxtehude&rsquo;s music (e.g., BuxWV 184,  186, 187, 208, 209, 199, and 200).<br/>Dodds&rsquo;s conclusion: Werckmeister&rsquo;s teachings thus illuminate the<br/>improvisational basis of Buxtehude&rsquo;s chorale preludes (Dodds, p. 16).</p><p>____________________________________</p><p>_[i]_ (#_ednref1)  Dodds referenced  Hamonologia musica paragraph  194.</p><p>Tom:  Are you saying then that it would be  impossible for Buxtehude to<br/>improvise on an organ tuned in meantone?

I don&apos;t even like that word, and I don&apos;t use it.

Buxtehude&apos;s *music*, at least in those several E minor suites, tells me all by itself that Werckmeister III is not good for it.  W-III&apos;s D#s and A#s are much too high for the contexts in which those notes are used. W-III&apos;s A# is also too high for Buxtehude&apos;s D major suite, BuxWV 232. If someone tries to press onto me the argument that Buxtehude used W-III anyway for these pieces (on what evidence beyond a boatload of wishful thinking?), I&apos;d first have to be convinced that Buxtehude actually couldn&apos;t hear pitch very well, and therefore he somehow deferred his judgment in such matters.  And that&apos;s absurd.  Why should Buxtehude prefer, or be stuck with, *any* published theoretical scheme found in any book?</p><p>I&apos;d be much more inclined to believe that Buxtehude simply nudged his D# and A# low enough until they sounded good, since they don&apos;t *need* to function as Eb and Bb (or connect up with F) in these particular pieces.   Buxtehude&apos;s A-major suite (BuxWV 243) makes an even stronger case against W-III, since the passage with B# and E# in it just sounds preposterous (in my opinion) with as much as a full comma of error each in C#-E# and G#-B#, as W-III has.</p><p>And if W-III doesn&apos;t work for these relatively simple harpsichord pieces by Buxtehude, how can anyone expect it to work for the more complicated music of Bach, either?  That&apos;s where *I&apos;m* coming from on this.  I&apos;ve played all this music.  I&apos;ll use the gentlemanly and understated word &quot;unrefined&quot; to describe how it sounds in W-III, on harpsichord.  It&apos;s much worse than &quot;unrefined&quot;.</p><p>Suppose that Buxtehude was giving some nice little evening performance of violin sonatas from his own Opus 1, published 1694.  Sonata #3 is in A minor, and sonata #4 is in B-flat major.  Where should he put his D#/Eb, his G#/Ab, and his A#/Bb to be able to play continuo successfully in these compositions?  And, supposing that his violinist could actually hear, how similarly (or differently? why?) should the 5ths G-D, D-A, and A-E be tempered on Buxtehude&apos;s harpsichord?  (&quot;Gee, Friedrich, I&apos;m really sorry, but because my buddy Werckmeister&apos;s book says the A-E has to be pure while the G-D-A are 1/4 comma narrow each, that&apos;s what we MUST do!

Werckmeister&apos;s &quot;III&quot; temperament (the one he called his first<br/>&quot;correct&quot; temp) doesn&apos;t solve meantone&apos;s problems.  It leaves four of<br/>the five worst and most obvious problems in place!  It gets rid of the<br/>wolf 5th, sure, but it doesn&apos;t get rid of the four wide diminished<br/>4ths (typically F#-Bb, C#-F, G#-C, and B-Eb).

What &quot;revolution in thinking&quot; is this idea of modifying regular<br/>meantone layouts so they sound better in more keys?

Do you have any evidence whatsoever that  Bach ever met<br/>Werckmeister, or that they were ever friends?</p><p>Johnny:<br/>There are connections to be made between Werckmeister  and Bach, although<br/>they never met.  Bach&apos;s cousin, Johann Walther, studied  with Werckmeister, while<br/>continuing correspondence afterwards until Werckmeister  passed away.<br/>Additionally, Werckmeister sent his cousin many different  works, especially works<br/>by Buxtehude.  Werckmeister inherited the entire  Praetorious collection, btw.<br/>Werckmeister was practically a next door  neighbor in terms of georgraphical<br/>proximity.  Werckmeister&apos;s ideas were  the big, bright ideas of the time,<br/>fully exploited by Bach at the age of 18 in  Arnstadt when he adjudicated the new<br/>organ in Arnstadt built by Wender,  identified as in the Werckmeister camp by<br/>Kuhnau (as opposed to the meantone  Silbermann).</p><p>Brad:<br/>2. Werckmeister&apos;2. Werckmeister&apos;&lt;WBR&gt;s &quot;III&quot; temperament (the  on<br/>&quot;correct&quot; temp) doesn&apos;t solve meantone&apos;s problems. It  leaves four of<br/>the five worst and most obvious problems in place! It gets rid  of the<br/>wolf 5th, sure, but it doesn&apos;t get rid of the four wide  diminished<br/>4ths (typically F#-Bb, C#-F, G#-C, and B-Eb). All it does is  trim<br/>them down a little bit to become Pythagorean in size,  *less*<br/>annoyingly far out of tune...only a full syntonic comma too  wide.</p><p>Johnny:<br/>This is your own well expressed and passionate point of  view.  It likely<br/>influences many, internationally, who are swayed by such  detailed passion.<br/>Only...it doesn&apos;t hold up to scrutiny.  Surely, you  must recognize that I<br/>disagree with you.  The larger fourths are  delicious.  It does so much for the music<br/>of Bach.  It lends character  to the well-temperament that is Bach, making<br/>musically craggy what is  otherwise more stark.  According to Werckmeister&apos;s,<br/>meantone&apos;s problem  number one is the howling wolf.  There were other items, too<br/>many  accidentals,  too many new notes requiring subsemitones, too<br/>non-chromatic as a result, etc.</p><p>Brad:<br/>3. What &quot;revolution in thinking&quot; is this idea of  modifying regular<br/>meantone layouts so they sound better in more keys? You&apos;d  have to<br/>prove that nobody before Werckmeister ever conceived of, or  said<br/>anything about, or ever *did* in practice, any spreading-around  of<br/>pure 5ths here and there to get rid of a wolf. Maybe John Bull<br/>thought  of it, or somebody else, generations before Werckmeister was<br/>even born. How  do you &quot;know&quot; that Werckmeister was making up anything<br/>that was in any way  new?</p><p>Johnny:  Actually, you would have to prove there  was someone earlier, which<br/>you have not.  Even if someone had preceded  Werckmeister, perhaps someone in<br/>China, it doesn&apos;t have the clout of influence  that makes the difference.<br/>This same clout is right on top of the young  and impressionable JS Bach.  To my<br/>knowledge, W. is the first to write  of the circle of fifths which allowed for<br/>the homogenization of the  enharmonic identities into the same note.<br/>Admittedly, Marin Mersenne wrote  theoretically about equal temperament, even Zarlino<br/>wrote about equal  temperament for lutes, but Werckmeister is the man when it<br/>came to a circular  well temperament on the organ and other keyboards.  BTW,<br/>WIII is  recommended for all keyboards, not just the organ, as some have<br/>implied.</p><p>Brad:<br/>4. How do you suppose that Bach&apos;s uncle, the  one he called &quot;the<br/>profound composer&quot;, was tuning in Eisenach when JSB was  born there in<br/>1685 (and before that)? That elder Bach&apos;s music is  chromatically<br/>adventurous, too, and doesn&apos;t really work in any sort of  meantone.<br/>Couldn&apos;t he have been using some circulating temperament(Couldn&apos;t he h<br/>way before Werckmeister put anything into print?</p><p>Johnny:<br/>Yes, I believe Uncle JC Bach did use what came to be  called WIII tuning, if<br/>not one of the other variants.  W. was very careful  not to imply he invented<br/>it.  It was already in use.  The big gun in  the neighborhood of W. was uncle<br/>JC.  They probably met, JC and AW, if only  because of their mutual interests,<br/>accomplishments, and fame.  Both was  mugged by the system and complained<br/>about it (e.g., wages being robbed,  misunderstandings by those around them,<br/>chromaticism, from a famous family of  musicians).</p><p>Brad:<br/>Again, where do you<br/>get the idea that W&apos;s work was  revolutionary? Are you just studying<br/>*published documents*, or are you  studying real music and the notes<br/>used in it?</p><p>Johnny:  I&apos;ve written a book on the subject Bach  and Tuning.  Now that the<br/>school season is winding up, I should be able to  finish a version of the book<br/>that can be distributed.  Certainly, if I were  to simply rehash what has<br/>already been published there would be no purpose to  volunteer to spend so many<br/>hours over 3 decades.  I learned to speak German  for this.  I wrote a master<br/>thesis at columbia university on this.  I  visited and researched in Leipzig,<br/>Muhlhausen, Eisenach, Kothen, Arnstadt,  Erfurt, and Wolfenbuttal to this<br/>effort.  Perhaps you could say I am taking  a more ethnomusicologically-influenced<br/>study.  The unequalness that makes  up well temperament is part of the<br/>Thuringian aesthetic of the period, as a  visit to Werckmeister&apos;s Quedlinburg church<br/>door demonstrates.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe Buxtehude shared with  Werckmeister the distaste for<br/>meantone which<br/>&gt; comes out of an  improviser&apos;s mind set. My email to Tom outlined the<br/>case<br/>&gt; for an  organ improviser to need a full circle of keys to be<br/>virtuosic, to be<br/>&gt; even, to be interesting (since there are greater differences  between<br/>keys in<br/>&gt; such tunings).</p><p>Brad:<br/>Gee, Johnny, you don&apos;t need to sell the  improvisation idea to *me*.<br/>I&apos;ve been improvising organ pieces in public for  more than 20 years.<br/>...<br/>Johnny:  Glad to hear of it.  Too bad you  didn&apos;t make it clear earlier.  Do<br/>you identify with the idea of needing a  full circle palate for chromatic<br/>improvisation?</p><p>Brad:<br/>And especially, have you read pages 213-217 in part 2  where I laid out<br/>my measurements of W-III, showing why it&apos;s lumpy?</p><p>Johnny: How academic.  I sing Werckmeister III  tuning, as I sing Harry<br/>Partch Li Po Songs.  What you call lumpy I find  dramatic.  Do you fully realize<br/>that this List includes all manner of  different tuning systems.  In recent<br/>years I have explored  polymicrotonality.  You could say I have the stretched ears<br/>that George  Ives hoped for his son Charles.  I don&apos;t see how your writing<br/>how  something sounds bad trumps my hearing that same something sounding good.<br/>Off hand, I don&apos;t recall anything that long (217 pages) that you wrote.<br/>Probably you mean the second part of the Oxford publication.  It&apos;s been  some<br/>time now.

Can we<br/>really determine when a composer wanted or expected to deviate from<br/>meantone simply by noting down the notes and counting them up?</p><p>Isn&apos;t this like saying, if some guy wrote 16th-notes he can&apos;t possibly<br/>have meant them to be performed as 32nd-notes - regardless of musical<br/>context?</p><p>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Afmmjr@ wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; case<br/>&gt; &gt; for an organ improviser to need a full circle of keys to be<br/>&gt; virtuosic, to be<br/>&gt; &gt; even, to be interesting (since there are greater differences between<br/>&gt; keys in<br/>&gt; &gt; such tunings).</p><p>Actually, most of Froberger&apos;s and Frescobaldi&apos;s notated improvisatory<br/>pieces - ie toccatas - do respect the usual bounds of meantone (G#-Eb,<br/>or D#-Ab with the common split keys) and probably were played on<br/>meantone organs. Does this mean that neither Froberger nor Frescobaldi<br/>were &apos;virtuosic&apos; or &apos;interesting&apos; improvisers?<br/>Aren&apos;t there much more essential aspects to improvisation than whether<br/>or not one is able to modulate to some specific key, or is able to<br/>play a chord with such and such an exact tuning which doesn&apos;t exist in<br/>meantone?</p><p>Anyway, I reject the notion (which seems to come from the 20th and<br/>21st century) that meantone need not be &apos;interesting&apos; with respect to<br/>modulation. If you look at those two composers you can see just how<br/>surprising and expressive it can be purely within meantone. Eg -<br/>juxtapose chords of C minor and A major, or Bb major vs F# minor in<br/>meantone, then try WIII or anything more equal... Chromatic<br/>alterations and progressions are if anything *more* interesting in<br/>meantone.</p><p>And if you do go outside G#-Eb (resp. D#-Ab), it needn&apos;t always lead<br/>to musical disaster, as Brad seems to be arguing with Buxtehude.</p><p>Frescobaldi and Froberger often wrote Db in exactly the contexts where<br/>it can be a well-tuned harmonic 7th or 7/6 if tuned to meantone C#.<br/>So does notated Db &apos;need&apos; musically to be higher than meantone C#? At<br/>least examine the musical context. We have another witness in Huygens<br/>who wrote about E minor being more plaintive than D minor because of<br/>its mistuned leading note. Why should we necessarily think that any<br/>unexpectedly high or low note in the scale was a handicap, rather than<br/>a feature or opportunity if used cleverly?</p><p>&gt; improvise harpsichord pieces during my tuning<br/>&gt; lectures, where I show the dead-ends of meantone layouts, and where I<br/>&gt; show the way circulating temperaments let us go everywhere.</p><p>Makes you wonder - if it was such a &apos;dead end&apos;, how could meantone<br/>possibly have been the standard keyboard tuning for so many hundreds<br/>of years?</p><p>Well ... perhaps people preferred a finite number of purely-tuned<br/>chords to the ability to play every possible chord on every possible<br/>chromatic degree - but none of them very well-tuned. Perhaps they had<br/>strongly different musical priorities from what either Brad or Johnny<br/>seem to have.</p><p>Saying &apos;dead-end&apos; and &apos;let us go everywhere&apos; is already strongly<br/>judgmental. Of course if you insist on trying to play a meantone<br/>instrument in a way it&apos;s not designed for you&apos;ll get an aural mess.<br/>Did musicians actually think like that? Did they insist on &apos;freedom&apos;<br/>at all costs? Did they consider it good practice to try and modulate<br/>to Db major regardless of the audible consequences? Did they, in<br/>short, behave like 19th-century pianists?</p><p>If I can rephrase the metaphor to reverse the bias: Meantone means<br/>several beautiful boulevards and a few stinking dead-ends, and<br/>everyone with a little intelligence knows how to keep out (or even how<br/>to visit them, if you need a certain something from the black market).<br/>Equal temperament means a featureless north-south grid of streets, all<br/>of them equally dirty - perfect freedom of movement but no reason to<br/>go anywhere. So much for &apos;freedom&apos;. In Brad&apos;s and Johnny&apos;s conception<br/>of circulating temperament you still have a grid and the streets are<br/>still all dirty - just that some are more dirty than others and the<br/>houses may be slightly different colours.</p><p>And that doesn&apos;t even account for the fact that the difference between<br/>consonance and dissonance *in a single key* is much more pronounced in<br/>meantone than in circulating temps. A skilled improviser in meantone<br/>can create just as much tension and contrast by using dissonance,<br/>scarcely modulating at all, as someone in a near-equal circular<br/>temperament could by the most daring modulations.</p><p>Even Werckmeister said in 1698 that Praetorius&apos; (meantone) tuning,<br/>either Eb-G# or occasionally with a split Eb/D#, had been perfectly<br/>good for his (P&apos;s) musical purposes...</p><p>Back to Buxtehude: I find the great majority of his harpsichord works<br/>are perfectly well playable either with plain meantone, or altering<br/>the pitch of exactly one note. If you want to play through without<br/>retuning you can do an even greater majority almost perfectly just by<br/>altering C#, G#, Eb and Bb.

In  any event, a modulation to a Db major chord, as<br/>related to some other chord in  any particular key, possibly a dominant of a<br/>dominant, requires for an  improviser no stop signs.

In comparison &gt; with many other musics, German Baroque music offers much more than &gt; mere clues.  If we were speaking about ancient Greek music, I would &gt; agree with you.  Modern presentations of ancient Greek music are pure &gt; nonsense.  Imagination aids knowledge in search of truth.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tom:  There is a missing link: we know what notes composers wrote, not &gt; what<br/>&gt; pitches they wanted or expected them to sound at. If we are serious<br/>&gt; about old music we should try to find some information about this<br/>&gt; *without* automatically referring to our present-day assumptions or<br/>&gt; conditioned preferences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --Johnny: From a musician&rsquo;s point of view, it is not the notes or the &gt; pitches, it is the intervals.  We (counting myself a musician) get &gt; meaning from intervals.  Notes may be a short-hand for notation.  &gt; Pitches are best for timbral discussion, and for relative pitch &gt; height.  But the true meaning of intervals is convoluted by &gt; temperament.  In today&rsquo;s music, dissonance includes noise, and it has &gt; been in ascendancy for decades.  At some point, a Baroque aesthetic &gt; developed that would allow for a positive acceptance, if not &gt; adoration, for different sized tempered intervals.  Without the &gt; insistence of an absolute pitch standard, it was all about the &gt; intervals.  We should be happy there is examination of early music &gt; here, but it need not be reflex.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a> &lt;mailto:tuning%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, &gt; Afmmjr@ wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; case<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for an organ improviser to need a full circle of keys to be<br/>&gt; &gt; virtuosic, to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; even, to be interesting (since there are greater differences between<br/>&gt; &gt; keys in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; such tunings).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tom:  Actually, most of Froberger&apos;s and Frescobaldi&apos;s notated &gt; improvisatory<br/>&gt; pieces - ie toccatas - do respect the usual bounds of meantone (G#-Eb,<br/>&gt; or D#-Ab with the common split keys) and probably were played on<br/>&gt; meantone organs.
