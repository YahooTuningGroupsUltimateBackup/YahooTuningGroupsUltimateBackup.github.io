Theory Already Takes Sharp Kicks</p><p>October 9, 2003<br/>By DENNIS OVERBYE</p><p>In an unusual logjam of contradictory claims, a<br/>revolutionary new model of the universe, as a soccer ball,<br/>arrives on astronomers&apos; desks this morning at least<br/>slightly deflated.</p><p>In a paper being published today in the journal Nature, Dr.<br/>Jeffrey Weeks, an independent mathematician in Canton,<br/>N.Y., and his colleagues suggest, based on analysis of maps<br/>of the Big Bang, that space is a kind of 12-sided hall of<br/>mirrors, in which the illusion of infinity is created by<br/>looking out and seeing multiple copies of the same stars.</p><p>If the model is correct, Dr. Weeks said, it would rule out<br/>a popular theory of the Big Bang that asserts that our own<br/>observable universe is just a bubble among others in a<br/>realm of vastly larger extent. &quot;It means we can just about<br/>see the whole universe now,&quot; Dr. Weeks said.</p><p>But other astronomers, including a group led by Dr. David<br/>Spergel of Princeton, said a continuing analysis of the<br/>same data had probably already ruled out the soccer ball<br/>universe. They promised to post their results soon on the<br/>physics Web site <a href="http://arXiv.org/list/astro-ph">arXiv.org/list/astro-ph</a>.</p><p>&quot;Weeks and friends are making a dramatic claim, perhaps one<br/>of the biggest science stories of the century,&quot; said Dr.<br/>Neil Cornish, a physicist at Montana State University, &quot;but<br/>extraordinary claims require extraordinary support.&quot;</p><p>For now, the two groups, who have been in intense<br/>communication the last few days, disagree on whether the<br/>soccer ball universe has been refuted. What is amazing<br/>about this debate, they all agree, is that it will actually<br/>be settled soon, underscoring the power of modern data to<br/>resolve issues that were once considered almost<br/>metaphysical.</p><p>&quot;This is what got Giordano Bruno burned at the stake,&quot; said<br/>Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of<br/>Pennsylvania. &quot;Is space infinite or not?&quot;</p><p>In Nature, Dr. Weeks and his colleagues write: &quot;Since<br/>antiquity, humans have wondered whether our universe is<br/>finite or infinite. Now, after more than two millennia of<br/>speculation, observational data might finally settle this<br/>ancient question.&quot; The other authors are Dr. Jean-Pierre<br/>Luminet of Paris Observatory; Dr. Alain Riazueleo of the<br/>French atomic energy center CEA, in Saclay, France; Dr.<br/>Roland Lehoucq of the Paris Observatory and CEA; and Dr.<br/>Jean-Phillippe Uzan of the University of Paris.</p><p>The evidence for and against a finite universe resides in a<br/>radio map of the baby universe produced last February by a<br/>NASA satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe.<br/>It shows that 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the event<br/>in which space and time emerged, the universe was laced<br/>with faint waves and ripples, which are the origin of<br/>modern galaxies and other cosmic structures. In an infinite<br/>universe, according to theory, waves of all size should<br/>appear in the sky, but in the Wilkinson data there was a<br/>cutoff: no waves larger than about 60 degrees across<br/>appeared in the sky.</p><p>If the universe were a musical instrument, it would be<br/>inexplicably missing its low notes, perhaps, some<br/>cosmologists have suggested, because it is too small to<br/>play them. The universe is finite rather than infinite,<br/>they speculate. Like a violin that cannot produce deep<br/>cello notes, the universe cannot produce waves larger than<br/>itself.</p><p>In such a universe, if you went far enough in one<br/>direction, you would find yourself back where you started,<br/>on the other side of the universe, like a cursor<br/>disappearing off the left side of a screen and reappearing<br/>on the right.</p><p>One simple example of this is a torus, or a bagel shape,<br/>which is what you get when you wrap the left and right and<br/>top and bottom sides of the screen around so that they<br/>meet.</p><p>In the Nature paper, Dr. Weeks and his colleagues propose<br/>that three-dimensional space has 12 sides, like a soccer<br/>ball, or more technically a dodecahedron. This model would<br/>fit with the cutoff of large waves observed in the<br/>Wilkinson satellite data. Each face is &quot;glued&quot; to its<br/>opposite number. (Don&apos;t try this at home.) A spaceship<br/>crossing one face or panel of the soccer ball would enter<br/>the other side of the ball. After traveling 74 billion<br/>light-years it would find itself back where it had started.</p><p>While the lack of cosmic low notes is suggestive,<br/>cosmologists say there is a definitive test of finite<br/>universes in the Wilkinson map. When the cosmic radiation<br/>intersects the edges of the universe, it would make<br/>identical circles, like a balloon squashed in a box, on<br/>opposite sides of the sky. In the case of a bagel, there<br/>would be two circles in the map, on opposite sides of the<br/>sky. In the case of Dr. Weeks&apos;s dodecahedron, there would<br/>be six pairs of circles, each about 35 degrees in diameter.</p><p>&quot;This is a much higher bar to clear,&quot; Dr. Cornish said.</p><p>Dr. Tegmark said: &quot;What&apos;s nice is it&apos;s so testable. It&apos;s<br/>the truth or it&apos;s dead. The data is even out there, on the<br/>Internet. It&apos;s just a question of sifting through it.&quot;</p><p>But so far the circles have not showed up.</p><p>Earlier this<br/>year, Dr. Tegmark and his wife and colleague Dr. Angelica<br/>Oliveira-Costa, Dr. Mattias Zaldarriago, of Harvard, and<br/>Dr. Andrew Hamilton of the University of Colorado, searched<br/>the Wilkinson data for oppositely matched circles. The<br/>results, they said, ruled out the possibility that the<br/>universe was shaped like a bagel, no doubt disappointing<br/>New Yorkers who would like to have imagined a cosmic<br/>connection with their breakfast.</p><p>Dr. Tegmark said that the results also ruled out Dr.<br/>Weeks&apos;s dodecahedron. &quot;We ought to have seen those circles<br/>in our study,&quot; he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, a more thorough analysis of the data, looking<br/>for all possible circles, has been undertaken by Dr.<br/>Spergel, who was part of the original Wilkinson team, Dr.<br/>Cornish, and Dr. Glenn Starkman of Case Western Reserve<br/>University in Cleveland. The study, about two-thirds<br/>complete, had already eliminated many simple models of<br/>so-called &quot;small universes,&quot; including a dodecahedron when<br/>the Nature paper hit their desks last week, Dr. Spergel<br/>said.</p><p>&quot;No soccer ball, no doughnuts, no bagels,&quot; he said.</p><p>But Dr. Weeks said there were potential gaps in the circle<br/>search methods. For one thing, if the dodecahedron were<br/>slightly larger, he said, the circles would be smaller and<br/>would not show up in Dr. Spergel&apos;s search. But until all<br/>the papers are posted on the archive or published where<br/>everybody can read them, these claims cannot be evaluated.</p><p>Dr. Weeks said that astronomers from both teams would join<br/>this fall to test the circle search, using simulated data.<br/>If the models are false, they could be ruled out as early<br/>as November, he said.</p><p>Dr. Cornish said that, although it was the scientific<br/>community that would ultimately decide, his team was<br/>confident of its results. &quot;I don&apos;t see any wiggle room,&quot; he<br/>said.</p><p>But because it is such a &quot;truly spectacular claim,&quot; he<br/>said, they are planning in the next few days to run a<br/>special test focused on the particular model. The test<br/>could detect very small circles. &quot;We can push it to where<br/>there&apos;s no chance,&quot; Dr. Cornish said.</p><p>The prospects for the finite universe, he added, look<br/>bleak.</p><p>The stakes for cosmology, should the soccer ball or some<br/>other variety of small universe prevail, are not small at<br/>all. A small universe, everybody agrees, would present<br/>severe problems for the prevailing theory of the Big Bang,<br/>known as inflation, which posits that the cosmos underwent<br/>a burst of hyperexpansion in its first moments.</p><p>Moreover, Dr. Weeks said, a small universe would eliminate<br/>one popular variant of the theory known as eternal<br/>inflation, in which bubble universes give rise to one<br/>another endlessly in what some cosmologists call a<br/>&quot;multiverse.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This puts the whole universe in view,&quot; he explained. &quot;It<br/>wouldn&apos;t rule out other universes. There could be others.<br/>They would be totally unrelated, without any contact<br/>between them.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/09/science/09COSM.html?ex=1066793500&ei=1&en=4b4341247d8d7038">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/09/science/09COSM.html?ex=1066793500&ei=1&en=4b4341247d8d7038</a></p></div><h3><a id=47866 href="#47866">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@anaphoria.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2003 4:23:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;</p><p>I find it amazing that dispite what they see, that so much &apos;science&apos; is unconcious of their own  projections.<br/> It is absurd it ever got as far as it did</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    From: John Chalmers &lt;<a href="mailto:JHCHALMERS@UCSD.EDU">JHCHALMERS@UCSD.EDU</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Another dissent from Soccer Ball universe<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Date: Fri, 10 Oct 2003 09:45:53 -0700<br/>&gt;    From: John Chalmers &lt;<a href="mailto:JHCHALMERS@UCSD.EDU">JHCHALMERS@UCSD.EDU</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Soccer-Ball Theory of Universe&apos;s topology<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Not so fast!<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- -Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/> KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=47891 href="#47891">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Arnold &#x3C;billarnoldfla@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2003 6:31:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Kraig.</p><p>You get the *GOLDEN* Globe award on Tuning.</p><p>This *IS* my absolute last post to Jon&apos;s narrow<br/>scoped list.</p><p>The trouble with intellectuals today is they left<br/>their intellect behind when they came to the PC,<br/>and the *Jon* types of this world really wish us<br/>all to think that they can think, and the way they<br/>think is the only way to think: *E-X-C-L-U-S-I-O-N*<br/>of what they think, and we all know non-thinkers cannot<br/>think, is off-topic.</p><p>Enjoy Tuning, tuners, as I am *T-U-N-I-N_G* now;<br/>over, and *O-U-T*</p><p>Bill</p><p>=========================================</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, kraig grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find it amazing that dispite what they see, that so<br/>much &apos;science&apos; is unconcious of their own  projections.<br/>&gt;  It is absurd it ever got as far as it did<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    From: John Chalmers &lt;JHCHALMERS@U...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Another dissent from Soccer Ball universe<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Date: Fri, 10 Oct 2003 09:45:53 -0700<br/>&gt; &gt;    From: John Chalmers &lt;JHCHALMERS@U...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Soccer-Ball Theory of Universe&apos;s topology<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not so fast!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -- -Kraig Grady<br/>&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island<br/>&gt;  <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a><br/>&gt; The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>&gt;  KXLU 88.9 FM WED 8-9PM PST</p></div><h3><a id=47903 href="#47903">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2003 6:17:04 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bill Arnold wrote:</p><p>&gt;Enjoy Tuning, tuners, as I am *T-U-N-I-N_G* now;<br/>&gt;over, and *O-U-T*<br/>&gt;</p><p>Promise?</p><p>--<br/>* David Beardsley<br/>* microtonal guitar<br/>* <a href="http://biink.com/db">http://biink.com/db</a></p></div>
