What do you mean by &quot;better&quot;?<br/>Certainly for 5-limit diatonicism, you&apos;re correct -- but would you not admit<br/>other possibilities?</p><p>&gt;Wilson&apos;s attractive method of showing how the<br/>&gt;various intervals generate scales pointed out to me that the fact that<br/>&gt;certain intervals generate good scales in Rothenberg&apos;s sense after fewer<br/>&gt;repetitions than others depends in a regular way upon the rough amount of<br/>&gt;the octave which that interval takes up, and that the best always seem to<br/>&gt;be those in the vicinity of the fifth.</p><p>Aha -- I think I see what you&apos;re getting at. I think you&apos;re mistaken. Try,<br/>for example, a generator which is 2^phi or 741.64 cents. It produces more<br/>evenly-spaced scales more often than any other generator (in a certain<br/>mathematical sense). This will get into a discussion of noble numbers, etc.<br/>-- see Wilson&apos;s excellent Scale Tree diagram.</p></div>
