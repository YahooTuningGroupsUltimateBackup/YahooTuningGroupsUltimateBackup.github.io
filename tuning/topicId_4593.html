All are related by a factor 3, but the relationship<br/>&gt;&gt; doesn&apos;t carry over between 2*3 and 3*3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I totally agree and would say &quot;odd&quot; where Joe Monzo said<br/>&gt; &quot;prime&quot;. Unfortunately it is not so clear on the site which is<br/>&gt; my original text and which is Joe&apos;s commentary. Joe, perhaps it<br/>&gt; would be helpful to put the initials of the author in front of<br/>&gt; each paragraph?</p><p>I would continue to say &apos;prime&apos;, and add that &apos;odd&apos; may also<br/>be admissible as yet another &apos;separate dimension of sonance that<br/>does not necessarily exclude any of the others&apos;.</p><p>While Paul Erlich maintains that odd-limits are a more important<br/>consideration in tuning than prime-limits, he himself has<br/>admitted that primes do form a separate &apos;dimension&apos; in tuning,<br/>in that each one has a unique sound that is required for<br/>tuning even when one is concerned mainly with thinking in<br/>terms of odd-limits, that is, including composites (i.e.,<br/>non-prime odds) as delimiters.</p><p>The fact that this is true is why I speak of primes as possibly<br/>constituting the separate dimensions of sonance.  Intervals<br/>that are measured as composite odd ratios are ultimately<br/>reducible aurally to their constituent primes.</p><p>(This is not to argue the merits of thinking in terms of<br/>odd-limits when composing, performing, or listening.)</p><p>As far as making clear on the webpage what is original with<br/>Paul Erlich and what is added commentary by me, Paul&apos;s original<br/>postings are indented and appear in Times New Roman font,<br/>where my commentary starts at the margin and appears in<br/>the more modern-looking Arial font.  I try to make this a<br/>standard procedure when quoting someone else&apos;s material.</p><p>The URL being tossed around for the Harmonic Entropy webpage<br/>is an old and outdated one.  The &apos;official&apos; address for the<br/>Harmonic Entropy page is:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/entropy.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/entropy.htm</a></p><p>I have added the information about the fonts at the beginning,<br/>and have finally included the graphs that were on Dave Keenan&apos;s<br/>page but were missing from mine.</p><p>There is also a link to the unedited original text of the<br/>postings by Paul Erlich.</p><p>Many thanks to Dave for graciously hosting this page when I<br/>had FTP problems in the the spring, and even more for his<br/>patience with me while I took so long to update my site.<br/>Dave, you can now delete those files.  Anyone who had the<br/>Dave Keenan address bookmarked for Harmonic Entropy should<br/>replace it with the one given above.
