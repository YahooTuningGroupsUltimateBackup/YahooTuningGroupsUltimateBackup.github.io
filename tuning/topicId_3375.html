IMO it&apos;s simply because 12:15:18 is too<br/>consonant, too &quot;rested,&quot; too &quot;final&quot; sounding, if you will,<br/>to supply the harmonic energy its role requires.  Raising<br/>the pitch of the 15/8 somewhat (and leaving the other<br/>pitches _alone_, thank you! ;-) gives the chord enough<br/>&quot;activeness&quot; or tension to match the sense of imminent<br/>resolution required by compositions in the Age of<br/>Temperaments.</p><p>And I don&apos;t think it has anything to do with Pythagorean<br/>intervals, it&apos;s just raised some to make it more active.</p><p>You know, if you raise the 12 along with the 15, you&apos;ve lost<br/>the pure 4/3 between the roots of the chords, so where has<br/>that gotten you?!  Unless you plan to shift the 1 up as<br/>well, and then you&apos;ve really got some juggling to do.  It<br/>gets worse instead of better, I think.  The dissonance of a<br/>12:15.nnn:18 helps pull off the dominant/tonic resolution in<br/>Classical and Romantic period music, to my ears.</p><p>In fact, I&apos;m beginning to wonder whether flattened fifths<br/>don&apos;t actually help.  But that&apos;s another story.</p><p>Renaissance compositions, even some Baroque ones, don&apos;t need<br/>that raised LT, to my ears, because there is more of a sense<br/>of simply hop-scotching around the lattice rather than of<br/>building and releasing harmonic tension.</p><p>I don&apos;t personally see the point of making a Beethoven piece<br/>5-lim JI, other than the simply educational purpose of<br/>taking it apart and putting back together intentionally<br/>wrongly to see what will happen.  It couldn&apos;t have been<br/>written that way, it wasn&apos;t intended to be, and it doesn&apos;t<br/>work well, anyway.  It assumes the vanishing comma, among<br/>other things.  It&apos;s analogous to what Margo said, if one<br/>&gt; attempted to make Bach&apos;s or Beethoven&apos;s triadic harmonies &quot;richer&quot; by<br/>&gt; adding pure 7:4&apos;s where stable triads are expected, this would be<br/>&gt; &quot;ungrammatical,&quot;</p><p>I think it best to stick to historical temperaments for<br/>Beethoven and his musical kin about 100 years on either<br/>side.</p><p>David J.

I currently leave all these<br/>tuned in 12-tET (though members of the list have suggested other<br/>alternatives).</p><p>Also, FYI, I am into 7-limit JI; I tune my dominant 7ths 4:5:6:7 (which,<br/>apparently, puts me in the minority of people on this list!).  The<br/>very flat 7th, which resolves downward to the 3rd degree from tonic,<br/>compensates for the rather large step from the leading tone to tonic,<br/>in my opinion.  I hear the sharpening of the leading tone as a<br/>seductive temptation (it DOES increase the energy in some way...) which,<br/>once one hears the benefit of a properly tuned dominant chord (with or<br/>without 7th), becomes unnecessary.</p><p>You are right to say that it remains to be seen how successful I, or<br/>anyone else, will be at transcribing 19th century music to JI.

Finally, in the late Classical period composers began to also regularly<br/>presuppose the vanishing of the lesser or greater diesis (or equivalently,<br/>given the vanishing syntonic comma, they were presupposing the vanishing of<br/>the Pythagorean comma).

This program DOES<br/>respond on the fly to the set of notes playing, but, because it has no<br/>knowledge of how long the current set will last, it can&apos;t engage many of<br/>the maximizing algorithms that a &quot;leisure retuning&quot; program can (leisure<br/>meaning, able to look forward in time, having the whole sequence at<br/>hand).

They ARE wonderfully<br/>tuned, with six lovely JI intervals, yet they are also SO plaintive, so<br/>begging for resolution, to my ear.  I think Ray Tomes may be the only<br/>other list member who has agreed!  In any case, I am resigned to<br/>writing software that does not lock in this tuning (even the current<br/>program, JI Relay, requires only a change to the tuning file).</p><p>Double-digit primes definitely have possibilities, I agree.  I&apos;ve<br/>played a bit with 11 and 13, which fill in all the integers of the<br/>higher octave (8 to 16).  The chords are surprising (of course!) and<br/>rich.  I haven&apos;t tried 17, which some advocate using (for a Neopolitan<br/>2nd?  I can&apos;t recall).</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=3480 href="#3480">ðŸ”—</a>Fred Reinagel &#x3C;violab@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/10/1999 7:10:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John A. deLaubenfels wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I seem to stand alone in my assessment that 12:15:18:21 dom 7ths are<br/>&gt; not overly stable (&quot;reduce the drama too much&quot;).

I love *good* barbership<br/>singing.  I think the &quot;begging for resolution&quot; comes about because of<br/>the small 21:20 downward &quot;leading&quot; semitone to the perfectly concordant<br/>3rd in the 8:12:16:20 resolution chord.
