He got interested in the idea, and a few days ago, I received 12 Ethno boxes.<br/>So, to whoever it may concern, I inform that the AEH is opening a microtonal competition where one can win a free box of MOTU Ethno version 2 (value 374 $ or 329 euros), a virtual world instrument plug-in now Scala-compatible and provided with 155 extended-JI tunings of my creation.</p><p><a href="http://www.motu.com/products/software/ethno/microtuning.html">http://www.motu.com/products/software/ethno/microtuning.html</a></p><p>These boxes are complete and with a demo license, it means they cannot be used for resale.<br/>Here are the rules of this competition. Feel free to discuss them if you think they can be improved, or completed, then I will confirm the definitive rules.</p><p>CALENDAR :<br/>1. In a first period starting today, candidates may send me (offlist) a short mail saying that they are interested to participate, with their country of residence/profession /activities, and an eventual web page about their music. This is for us to have a rough idea of the number of potential candidates, their geographic repartition and domains of interest.<br/>Please write only if you have a machine that meets the required configurations for installing Ethno 2 (check on MOTU&apos;s website page Specifications / Full system requirements) :<br/><a href="http://www.motu.com/techsupport/technotes/ethno-instrument-2-system-requirements">http://www.motu.com/techsupport/technotes/ethno-instrument-2-system-requirements</a><br/>(unfortunately Linux operating systems do not apply to those)<br/>2. In a second period, the AEH will answer either by accepting your candidature, or by refusing it (with an explanation), or by asking eventual precisions or links to some of your works.<br/>3. The AEH jury will then deliberate and select 11 concurrents (because one box is for the AEH studios), will inform them, personnally and through the Tuning List, and send them each one 1 Ethno box, to our own charge. I can&apos;t say at the moment if the participants will have to pay customs charges at reception, because we already paid customs when we received the 12 boxes from the USA and I have to check about that, but at the worst this would be a few $.<br/>4. In a third period, the candidates will have up to the 21st of June 2010 to sent their musical works (free of rights), in the form of mp3 files, each one with a title and 1 line of presentation.<br/>5. The AEH jury will then select a few demos in different categories among which some, along with the musician name and line of presentation, will be proposed for the Ethno2 pages of MOTU&apos;s website, and eventually other sites. The results will be mailed to the participants and to the Tuning List.<br/>6. Without engagement about it, and only if the received demos show a high level of musical quality, the AEH may edit a CD mix of a collection of them.</p><p>SPECIFIC RULES :<br/>1. The competition is open to all and covers two categories :<br/>- the first one concerns works based on the original Ethno2 microtunings (except the default tuning) ;<br/>- the second one concerns all other microtunings, either from the Scala archive or other sources, or the participant&apos;s personal tunings.<br/>2. In both categories the tunings will have to be precised.<br/>3. There is no maximum of demos by participant for both categories, but whatever the tuning choices, selected participants have to produce at least THREE demos using the original Ethno2 tunings.<br/>The reasons for that rule are at least double : for one thing these original tunings represent an important research work from the AEH and hearing them played and perhaps commented by other musicians, besides being a great pleasure, will be very instructive to us ; but also, musicians able to create their own tunings or even to choose them from other sources being an infime proportion of Ethno2 potential purchasers, it is fair to ask that all participants, even if advanced microtonalists, contribute to a minimum of demos using the original tunings.<br/>4. Musical styles are open, they can range from traditional music or imitations, ethno-rock, or experimental, ETC., but should have a microtonal character AND be pleasant to hear, even for non-connoisseurs.<br/>5. Ethno has to be the only sound source, and the only tools authorized to make these demos are Ethno2, and multitrack recorders or audio/MIDI sequencers.<br/>6. Except for improbable combinations we dissuade the use of melodic loops and phrases from Ethno, simply because their tunings are non-tunable, either 12-ET or undefined, and would add confusion.<br/>7. Demos can be sent any time at Jacques Dudon&apos;s personal mail :<br/>fotosonix@...<br/>8. They should be in mp3 format, 44,1 Khz MPEG stereo, 160 kbps.<br/>9. Their minimum duration should be 50&quot;, and maximum 3 minutes (in the eventuality of a CD release, longer versions and in WAV format could be asked from the participants).<br/>10. Participants who fail to fulfill the rules for whatever reason or unforeseen difficulty will have to uninstall Ethno2 and return the full Ethno box to their own charges to the AEH as soon as possible and before the 21st of May 2010 at latest.<br/>11. People who already own Ethno2 may participate for fun, without the required minimum of 3 demos asked to other participants.<br/>12. The AEH has no objection to the divulgation of the demos in competition by their authors at any time (for example through links mailed to the Tuning List, but NOT by sending files to the Tuning List).</p><p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONS :<br/>I understand that many musicians might have difficulty to determine their candidature without knowing the technical, practical and microtonal features of Ethno2. The MOTU&apos;s website offers some answers, and FAQ ressources. Having installed Ethno2 myself, any questions are welcome and I open today two parallel threads for that purpose, the first one for technical aspects of Ethno2, the second about my tunings.</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>Jacques Dudon</p><p>Atelier d&apos;Exploration Harmonique<br/>Les Camails - 83340  LE THORONET - France<br/><a href="http://aeh.free.fr">http://aeh.free.fr</a></p></div><h3>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2010 12:11:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #ddd'><b>Attachments</b></div><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Yes, this is another one of my infamous &quot;scale-chord&quot; demos and is also in the file section.</p><p>Listen to this, which has my scale being played for each note in the octave plus 3 notes (all sustained IE acting as a chord) and the JI diatonic doing the same thing.<br/>The goal is to get a higher sense of relaxation for my scale in this worst-case scenario.</p><p>     Note JI diatonic supposedly has the best consonance level regarding all possible root tones and overtones assuming fairly harmonic timbres...and yet I&apos;m pretty sure this at least casts some doubt as to whether that is true.<br/>  The two major advantages this scale aims at over diatonic JI are<br/>1)  Better root-note critical band dissonance via use of fairly low super-particular ratios between consecutive notes (13/12 or simpler)...it keeps those &quot;minor seconds&quot; fairly low-limit and not just things like thirds and larger intervals.<br/>2)  Uses mirroring around very simple intervals ALA my old &quot;Silver Sections&quot; scale to make it easier for the brain to keep track of patterns between the notes.
