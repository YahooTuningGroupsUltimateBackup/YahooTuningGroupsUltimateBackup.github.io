surely does describe a sample depth, but what I wanted to<br/>do was<br/>find:</p><p>n<br/>E n^2 *(0, 1)<br/>0</p><p>which is a sample depth reversed.</p><p>A little mental effort actually shows that this gives a sampling system all<br/>right, but with<br/>BLOOMING GREAT HOLES!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>There is another means to encrypt:</p><p>n<br/>E n^2 * (0, 4, 2.25, 1.77777777777777, 1.5625, 1.44------&gt;1)<br/>0</p><p>which is a reverse sampleing system, without hoels, and map it back to 2^n,<br/>and hey<br/>presto, we have two more variants.</p><p>For now, as time permist, and I am hungry, I will mention, that there are<br/>two other<br/>variants that a worthy of noteing.</p><p>The first is fuzzy sampling, and this, in fact, has a trinary based system,<br/>with:</p><p>0, 1, [2^(1/2)]&amp;n, which is the square root of two placed in a superpower<br/>stack, and<br/>this......x^(x^(x^x)))---&gt;converges towards the number 2.</p><p>Thus, the square root of two gives analogue and a digital system to be<br/>reckoned, and<br/>thus I checked out a basic stamp chip from an electronics shop, and again,<br/>came short<br/>due to cash.</p><p>I have one final arithmetic variant, and this is to map each sucessive<br/>sample&apos;s waveform,<br/>and put it to 0---&gt;10, and to take the reciprocal of the waveform&apos;s depth,<br/>where 1/0 is<br/>encountered, naturally, make it an arbitaritly large value.</p><p>I hav one final variant, and indeed, I wish to put word around about this,<br/>due to the fact<br/>that it involves another obsessive passion that I have with MICROTONAL<br/>MUSIC, and<br/>alternative tuning systems, and this is a version of Opus 4 sample&apos;s<br/>manipulated in 19<br/>Equal Tempemrent, time stretched, and up/down sampled.</p><p>Naturally, knowing me, I would have done all of this earlier, but as nearly<br/>always, I am<br/>short of cash.</p><p>I will, and am, putting word around at a rate of knots about Art of Noise,<br/>and the<br/>essence/spirit of Art of Noise, and grabbing samples, and reinacting the<br/>versions of AON.</p><p>I think there should be mre like your&apos;s.</p><p>Very Sincerely,</p><p>From New Zealand,</p><p>Sarn Richard Ursell.</p></div>
