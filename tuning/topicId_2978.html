There are a series<br/>of * and such with comments below about those notes/chords.  The case presented<br/>is the really simple rules case but some slightly more complex rules would give<br/>a better result as noted below.</p><p>The &quot;Note Numbers&quot; are simply semitone counts from a fixed point.<br/>The ratios are then determined by a simple mechanical procedure from the notes<br/>in the chord.  The &quot;Fundamental Note Freq.&quot; is then the note which has a ratio<br/>of 1 in respect to those notes.</p><p>Please note that with the advocated methodology the two &quot;A&quot;s in the second bar<br/>would both have frequency 891 Hz so that the melody would be correct.  However A<br/>has a different frequency in the different bars due to modulation from F to C.</p><p>POLONAISE :-     Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart       in the key of F</p><p>Notes       Note        Ratios     Fundamental      Frequencies<br/>Played      Numbers                Note Freq.

All bar 1 frequencies are divisible by 44 and the key is always F, while<br/>    bar 2 are all divisible by 33 and key is C (see note 3) and bar 3 all<br/>    notes are divisible by 44 again.</p><p>2.  The items above with a &quot;*&quot; are all A, but sometimes the frequency is<br/>    880 and at others 891.  See note 3 also.</p><p>3.  The item marked with a &quot;&amp;&quot; has ratios 3 10, but under the alternative<br/>    method (points for ratios) the ratios could be 8 27.  This would then<br/>    make the fundamental be C and agree with the rest of the bar.  This A<br/>    would then be frequency 891. The alternative method of note finder<br/>    would certainly give 8 27.</p><p>4.  The item marked &quot;@&quot; has the ratios 4 11, and 11 is not very common.<br/>    It seems that this was Mozart&apos;s intention as the fundamental is in<br/>    keeping with the surrounding chords.  Another possibility is 16 45.</p><p>5.  The item marked &quot;#&quot; has a ratio 42.  If the variation of ratios feature<br/>    was included, 42 and 43 would both be considered, and 42 chosen.</p><p>6.  All the frequencies are an exact number of Hz.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
