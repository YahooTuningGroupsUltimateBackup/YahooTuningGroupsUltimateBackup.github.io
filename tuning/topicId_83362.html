Starting with a length 1, the larger length, we add 0.618..., the smaller, which equates to multiplying by 1.618...i.e.<br/>1 (larger) + 0.618 (smaller) = 1 x 1.618 = 1.618. Next, we treat 1.618 as the new larger length and add (now) the smaller length 1 to obtain 2.618...But this again is the same as multiplying by 1.618, and therefore PHI^2 = 2.618...That is, 1.618 (larger) + 1 (smaller) = 1.618 x 1.618 = 2.618. Next,2.618 (larger) + 1.618 (smaller) = 4.23703...= PHI^3, and so on. Thus, the series is PHI^N, N = 1,2,3,...And this is pretty much the same as taking (2^(25/36))^N = 2^((25+25+25...N factors)/36). Bringing these into a single 8ve by mod 36 will generate all 36 numbers i.e. N = 1,2,3,...35.</p><p>Of course we can go the other way (towards smaller values) by treating the original 1 as the sum of two other PHI numbers, which is the same as now calling 0.618 the larger value. The smaller length is now obtained as 1 - 0.618 = 0.3818... = (1/PHI)^2 = PHI^-2. Continuing this process we get the series PHI^-N, or in 36 TET, (2^(25/36))^ -N, where N = 1,2,3,...35. In other words, bringing it into one 8ve we get all 35 notes once again.</p><p>This is mathematics Michael, and the math&apos;s doesn&apos;t lie. The problem we are now faced with is not finding a few other notes we can add to the original PHI triad because ALL 35 notes are already PHI notes, but rather which notes to leave out. My suggestion is to start by analysing 0:11:25 and begin to add other notes which are the differences between them eg 25 - 11 = 14, so add 14, 14 - 11 = 3, so add 3 etc... Then we can take symmetries, 36 - 14 = 22, 36 -3 = 33, etc...But since all 35 notes will again eventually be included, we need to find some critical cut-off point. Perhaps this can only be decided by the ears, much the same as why we cut-off sequences of major and minor thirds and vice-versa before the second 8ve i.e. maj69(#11) for major and min11 for minor chords?</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   For the record, you did get the numbers and generation method related to my scale right, BTW. :-)  And indeed, if you take powers of PHI divided by powers of 2 you end up getting 36TET.  Again, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a question of better or worse, just different.  And, to note, my hold PHI tuning (the exponential one) hit virtually all the notes of the 36TET tuning you use dead-on...so it seems we&apos;re simply interpreting PHI symmetry in different ways.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- On Mon, 5/4/09, rick_ballan &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: rick_ballan &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Using commonalities between Rick&apos;s PHI scale and Mike&apos;s/mine to make an &quot;ult<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Date: Monday, May 4, 2009, 9:24 PM<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       --- In tuning@yahoogroups. com, djtrancendance@ ... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Michael,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Below you give the intervals (1/PHI)^4 + 1) and (1/PHI)^2 + 1).

In 36 TET, 2/PHI  becomes 2 x 2^-(25/36)= 2^(11/36) = 1.235894, which is inverse PHI brought into one 8ve. PHI is replaced by 2^(25/36) and all notes in a 36TET can be generated via either of these two generating intervals to obtain 2^(1/36) as the new &quot;semitone&quot;. Further, tests will show that the differences b/w these and the original PHI intervals really is very negligible (i.e.way below 5 cents. For a more general discussion, you might want to look into harmonic entropy). Samples given by Michael also confirm that they produce all of the beating we would expect from PHI numbers i.e. beats 8ve equivalent to ratios. However, the advantage of 36TET is that it not only preserves 8ve equivalence, but also includes 12TET and ipso facto traditional harmonies i.e. 2^(3/36) = 2^(1/12) so that the standard EDO tuning is 0:3:6:...:33. I really do think that the problem is completely solved.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Rick</p></div><h3><a id=83414 href="#83414">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2009 3:00:09 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Below you [Michael] give the intervals (1/PHI)^4 + 1) and (1/PHI)^2 + 1).

And yet nobody ever really notices. Therefore, I&apos;m more inclined to believe that it is precisely because of this uncertainty that harmony can exist in the first place. Hindemith makes this point in craft of musical composition. This is why 5/4 can be substituted by 81/64, 645/512, 2^(1/3) and even the major third in your Lucy tuning (And the differences in these numbers are higher than the phi example I gave). So in my opinion it is not without some irony that mathematical exactitude can actually work against being an accurate model of musical harmony. But as to the width of this uncertainty before it is heard as being out of tune (or becoming another note), or as to which is the &quot;correct&quot; interval to which the others approximate, I don&apos;t know.</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am now beginning to develop my scales database at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lucytune.com/scales/">http://www.lucytune.com/scales/</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; to enable users to discover which tuning codes at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html">http://www.lucytune.com/midi_and_keyboard/pitch_bend.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; to use for which scales, for various choices of key (defined by the<br/>&gt; tonic; C C# ............

You&apos;ll find ancient and modern methods of doing just that- not generating a tuning via a generator and period, but by dividing and adding, and not necessarily with regard to JI or not.</p><p>I also rarely use generators and periods, almost always simply dividing things into what I need.</p><p>Maybe when you start using more long-sustaining tones you&apos;ll find as I do that phi actually isn&apos;t a sour interval at all. It&apos;s definitely not sour in the wugga-wugga! beating kind of way, as the beating is kind of a big blur, and the unique difference tone contributes to its eerie stability I believe.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; However...I wonder...how do the other methods &quot;merge to just &gt;intervals&quot;?</p><p>If you make a bunch of successive golden cuts and start poking around in the intervals that are created internally (in Scala you can just type &quot;show intervals&quot; and it will show them all), and you&apos;re familiar with the cent values of different JI intervals, you&apos;ll find them.</p><p>Aside from JI intervals and the very close JI approximations that just pop up, here&apos;s an example of how quickly golden sections and JI can be linked:<br/>take two intervals which you already know, and which reapppear in different places- 466 and 560 cents.

We use the term Harmonic Mean, a Mean used in all kinds of sciences from aviation to finance, but it was originally called the subcontrary mean until Archytas renamed it Harmonic a couple thousand years ago, as it was (and still is) used in musical tuning.</p><p>Far more fascinating than &quot;Da Vinci code&quot; style speculation is phi in nature, and as a deliberate tool.<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cameron&gt; &quot;I agree with this principle, although I&apos;ve found that &gt;maximizing<br/>&gt; possiblities takes a mixture of JI and very irrational intervals<br/>&gt; together.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; Actually I&apos;m starting to think that may well be step forward &gt;from my original idea as well.&nbsp; In fact I created a program to &gt;devise the most consonant 8-tone scale and it came up with a &gt;combination of splits of the silver ratio (using a similar type of &gt;generation/artistic-splitting formula to derive it) and a few tones &gt;very close to JI intervals.<br/>&gt; &nbsp; So, Cameron: what JI intervals do you think work best with these &gt;irrational number-based scales?</p><p>It completely depends, in my opinion and experience. In the case of phi and harmonic timbres, I find that the more concrete the fuzz of non-coincident partials, the MORE smooth the effect. So although I don&apos;t regard the pure octave as a mandatory interval in music at all, with phi it is best to have it. And rich bright harmonic spectra (phi spectra being a whole different world). And long sustained tones are nice to emphasize the effect. 2/1, 3/2 and 4/3 work wonderfully with the first few golden sections of the octave, and then other Just intervals depending on the &quot;mode&quot; so to speak. 8/7 and 7/4 show up next.</p><p>Of course it is not necessary to make the golden section on the octave, it can be done on any interval, rational or otherwise.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;1/1 and 2/1 gives you 3/2. 3/2 is the Mediant of the tonic and the<br/>&gt; octave. Now let&apos;s keep going... the Mediant of 3/2 and 2/1 is 5/3, the<br/>&gt; Mediant of 5/3 and 3/2 is 8/5, the Mediant of 8/5 and 5/3 is 13/8...<br/>&gt; we&apos;re just creating the Mediant between each ratio and the one before<br/>&gt; it... the mediant of 13/8 and 8/5 is 21/13...you see where it&apos;s going, right? :-) &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; So you are doing the same kind of splits, only using 1.5 rather &gt;than 1.618 as the splitting point.&nbsp;<br/>&gt;Although 13/8 is &gt;also&lt; what I &gt;came across as the best estimation &gt;for phi (boom!). :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; I&apos;m going &gt;to have to see what making a scale &gt;this way sounds like for &gt;myself...or do you actually already have a &gt;SCALA file of one which is pre-built?</p><p>Not making splits by 1.5- simply carrying out the mediant process. Look and see what happens- the next interval is 34/21, then 55/34... it&apos;s the Fibonacci series, and it is converging on phi!</p><p>Exactly like the famous Fibonacci spiral illustration. The intervals quickly  become clashing or indistinguishable as the spiral into the convergence point of phi- even 8/5 and 13/8 in the same tuning is pretty darn microtonal. An example of a fractal kind of use would be to have spirals spirally off of spirals, or convergences within convergences like you did.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;(In) John Chalmer&apos;s Divisions of the Tetrachord (also available &gt;online free now) you&apos;ll find ancient and modern methods of doing &gt;just that-<br/>&gt;  not generating a tuning via a generator and period, but by &gt;dividing and<br/>&gt; adding, and not necessarily with regard to JI or not.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &nbsp; Ok, now you definitely have my attention: I&apos;m definitely going to &gt;have to grab that (e)-book and try to look for such patterns as it &gt;seems to go into methods that reach far beyond standard generators &gt;and into the type of stuff I may take ages to end up duplicating by &gt;accident (when I could have just learned it straight out the first &gt;time).</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;It&apos;s definitely not sour in the wugga-wugga! beating kind of way,&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kind of in the same the way I find too much periodic buzz in a &gt;pure harmonic series as an overly mechanical beating...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot; as the beating is kind of a big blur, and the unique difference &gt;tone<br/>&gt; contributes to its eerie stability I believe.&quot;<br/>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; And, if I have it right, here we go again with assonance vs. &gt;dissonance.&nbsp; And I&apos;m all for controlled assonance and &quot;eerie &gt;stability&quot; vs. too much mechanical-sounding periodicity buzz. :-)</p></div><h3><a id=83589 href="#83589">ðŸ”—</a>Cameron Bobro &#x3C;misterbobro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2009 9:26:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Say Michael, I was just going through these topics and I have to ask: have you actually tried Wilson&apos;s Golden Horograms, as in tuned them up and tried to make music with them?</p></div>
