R. Jacobi. Celle: Hermann Moeck Verlag, Celle),</p><p>which was a enlarged, commented translation of<br/>Pier Francesco Tosi&apos;s<br/>&quot;Opinioni de&apos;cantori antichi e moderni o sieno Osservazioni sopra il<br/>canto figurato&quot;<br/>Bologna, 1723</p><p>[Capitalization by me]</p><p>I. Hauptst&iuml;&iquest;&half;ck, p. 1 f.<br/>[translated from Tosi]<br/>The teaching in the beginning should be carried out by a mediocre<br/>singer, until the pupil sing exactly from sight without mistake. ... He<br/>[the teacher] has to have an ease in his voice, some insight into good<br/>taste, an ability to make his thoughts easily understood to others,  a<br/>PERFECTLY PURE INTONATION, and finally a patience which can resist the<br/>greatest troublesomeness of one of the most annoying preoccupations.&quot; (a)<br/>(a) [Agricola&apos;s comment]:<br/>He must thus himself be able to sing, if he wants to teach others<br/>singing. It will be a great advantage to him and his subordinates, if he<br/>is able to accompany on the &quot;Claviere&quot; [harpsichord, clavichord]:<br/>because the pupils can master the PURE INTONATION double the better, if<br/>the can hear, besides the bass, the associated pure harmony as well.<br/>The first of these two main items [to be able to sing] is missing<br/>nowadays [1757] in German teachers, the second [to be able to accompany<br/>on the Clavier] in many Italian, alleged singing teachers.</p><p>p. 17 ff.<br/>Tosi:<br/>The teacher should take care, that the notes will be rendered by the<br/>pupil PERFECTLY PURE, when he sings their [respective solmization]<br/>syllables. He, WHO HAS NOT A GOOD EAR, SHOULD NEITHER undertake to<br/>TEACH, NOR to SING: because the defect of a voice, which rises and falls<br/>like ebb and flood, is simply intolerable. The teacher should really pay<br/>highest attention to this. Because a singer, who doesn&apos;t sing pure,<br/>certainly looses one of the most beautiful virtue which he might<br/>possess. Without that anyone could blame me for lying I can claim that<br/>(with the exception of a few singers) the new-fashioned intonation<br/>[1723] is very bad.<br/>...<br/>He has to render the semitones after the TRUE RULES. It is not known to<br/>everyone, that there are major and minor semitones: because you cannot<br/>hear this difference on an organ or the harpsichord, if they don&apos;t have<br/>split keys (h).<br/>(h) [Agricola&apos;s comment]:<br/>In some old organs and harpsichords were several/many of the upper keys<br/>cut apart from each other, of which one part [key] let sound somewhat<br/>lower pipes or strings, the other [part] somewhat higher ones; and these<br/>were called &quot;broken keys&quot;. Usually there were two in each octave: the<br/>key between G and A; and the one between D and E. The first one has to<br/>discern between G# and A-flat, the latter between D# and E-flat. In our<br/>times these broken keys have been completely abolished, because of the<br/>difficulties in playing the Clavier, and instead to strive for a better<br/>concordance of the temperament or &quot;beating tuning&quot;.<br/>...[follows a short discussion of the division of the whole tone in nine &quot;commas&quot;]<br/>Tosi: [p. 19]<br/>If one would always sing to the accompaniment of the previously<br/>mentioned two instruments (organ, harpsichord): this insight would be<br/>redundant. But since the composers invented the custom to let hear many<br/>arias in each opera, which are accompanied only by the strings, (i) an<br/>insight in this is very necessary.<br/>(i) [Agricola&apos;s comment]:<br/>This fashion is nowadays not flourishing so much as thirty or mor years<br/>ago, when Tosi lived. But it has not perished either.<br/>Tosi:<br/>For example, if a [male] soprano singer sings the d#&apos;&apos; like the eb&apos;&apos;,<br/>everyone who has ears can hear that he sings impure: because the latter<br/>[eb&apos;&apos;] should be somewhat higher. If this, what I said, is not enough,<br/>read different authors which deal with it (k), or consult the most<br/>famous violinists. In the middle parts this [difference] is not as easy<br/>to observe: though I think, that all can be observed [=heard] which can<br/>be &quot;divided&quot;. I will write more about this two [different] semitones, in<br/>the chapter on &quot;Vorschl&iuml;&iquest;&half;ge&quot;, and will show that they should not be<br/>mistaken for each other.<br/>(k) [Agricola&apos;s comment]:<br/>All authors belong who write about the temperament and the interval<br/>systems, for example Telemann, in the 3rd volume of the &quot;Mitzlersche<br/>musikalische Bibliothek&quot;, p. 713 p. Sorge in the calculation of ratio,<br/>and other famous men. Since in our time more intervals have come into<br/>use: therefore the singers have to make more serious efforts to render<br/>even the smallest differences of the intervals pure and safely, as much<br/>as possible to them.<br/>(l) [Agricola&apos;s comment]:<br/>Also flute-players. For example Quantz in the &apos;Versuch einer Anweisung<br/>die Fl&iuml;&iquest;&half;te traversiere zu spielen&quot;, p. 35, 37, 243 and 244.<br/>Tosi [p. 20]<br/>The singing teacher must teach his pupil to sing all leaps in scales,<br/>with PERFECTLY PURE INTONATION, SAFETY and ABILITY. He may teach him in<br/>this highly necessary exercise, even ad nauseam, if he wants that he<br/>[the pupil] should be able to find the notes in short time.</p><p>------------</p><p>Johann Joachim Quantz:<br/>Versuch einer Anweisung die Fl&iuml;&iquest;&half;te traversiere zu spielen<br/>Berlin, 1752<br/>Facs. Wiesbaden: Breitkopf &amp; H&iuml;&iquest;&half;rtel, 1988.</p><p>5. &iuml;&iquest;&half;., p. 35f.<br/>You can see from this, that the notes with a b [flats] are a comma<br/>[=small diesis] higher, as notes written with a #. Therefor the keys<br/>which are between D and E or between G and A, when they are in minor<br/>[d#-minor resp. eb-minor, g#-minor resp. ab-minor], as well as the key<br/>between C and D, when it is a major key [C#-major resp. Db-major], which<br/>are sometimes written with a b, sometimes with a #, played in a<br/>different way, so that D-flat is a comma [=small diesis] higher than C#,<br/>E-flat a comma [=small diesis] higher than D#; and A-flat a comma<br/>[=small diesis] higher than G#.<br/>8. &iuml;&iquest;&half;., p. 37<br/>The reason why I invented a second &quot;key&quot; for the flute, previosly not<br/>existing, is becuase of the difference of the large and small semitones.<br/>If a note on the same line or the same space is raised by a #, or<br/>lowered by a flat, the difference between these and the main note is a<br/>small semitone. But if a note is placed on a line, the other one step<br/>higher in a space and lowered by a flat, or if a note is placed on a<br/>line, and is raised by a #, but the other [note] staying natural and on<br/>the space one step higher: then the difference between these two notes<br/>is a major semitone. The major semitone has 5 commata, the minor has 4<br/>[commata]. Therefore the E-flat must be a comma [=small diesis] higher<br/>than D#.<br/>... To observe this difference and TO RENDER THESE NOTES IN THEIR PURE<br/>RATIO, IT WAS NECESSARY TO ADD ANOTHER KEY to the flute. ...<br/>It is true, [that] this difference can not be made on the Clavier, where<br/>you play all the notes on *one key, which are here [on the flute]<br/>different from each other. Not regarding this, since it is founded in<br/>the nature of the flute: because singers and bowed instruments can make<br/>this [difference] without effort [!], therefore it is reasonable to make<br/>this [difference] on the flute as well; which can not happen without the<br/>second key. He who will refine his ear, must have knowledge of this.</p><p>---------<br/>Leopold Mozart<br/>Versuch einer gr&iuml;&iquest;&half;ndlichen Violinschule<br/>Augsburg, 1756<br/>facs. ed.
