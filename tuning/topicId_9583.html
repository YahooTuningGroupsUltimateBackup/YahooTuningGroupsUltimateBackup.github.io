It&apos;s the only musical system that<br/>&gt;makes sense</p><p>Don&apos;t expect everyone on the list to agree with you. I don&apos;t. For example,<br/>how would you play a I-vi-ii-V-I progrssion in JI?</p><p>&gt;and I am overjoyed that there&apos;s a lyst on it.</p><p>&gt;Now to the question part. An obvious (to me) consequence of spacial arrays<br/>&gt;of ratios (lattices, ratio spaces &amp; such) is the concept of a numerical<br/>&gt;&quot;musical distance&quot; between two pitches. I&apos;ve already made my own musical<br/>&gt;distance formula based on the Pythagorian theorem, but I was wondering if<br/>&gt;there was an existing one to use instead. I haven&apos;t heard of one yet, but<br/>&gt;I&apos;m not yet well acquainted with the Just Intonation world.</p><p>There are several such distance measures, e.g., Euler&apos;s G.S., Barlow&apos;s<br/>digestibility, Wilson&apos;s harmonic complexity, and Tenney&apos;s harmonic distance.<br/>Tenney&apos;s is the only one of these that seems to satisfy some realistic<br/>acoustical requirements about reflecting the consonance of the interval<br/>itself, as I&apos;ve discussed (see the archives), while the others may be seen<br/>as taking into account possible contexts for the interval. See<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/harmonicdistance.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/dict/harmonicdistance.htm</a> (the &quot;4/b&quot; should<br/>be &quot;a/b&quot;). It&apos;s equivalent to the &quot;city-block&quot; distance between the two<br/>pitches on an appropriately constructed rectangular lattice. It is crucial<br/>not to &quot;octave-reduce&quot; any ratios when computing Tenney&apos;s distance function.<br/>For octave-equivalant scenarios, the archives contain discussions about the<br/>appropriate distance measures, which are computed on a triangular instead of<br/>a rectangular lattice. Or equivalently, you can use a more complex distance<br/>metric on the rectangular lattice, as in<br/><a href="http://www.kees.cc/tuning/perbl.html">http://www.kees.cc/tuning/perbl.html</a>.</p><p>I&apos;d be happy to discuss all this in greater depth, but there is one<br/>important problem with these lattice-based measures. Eventually you will<br/>find very distant intervals that are so close to consonant ones that one<br/>cannot audibly distinguish the difference. In such a scenario, what meaning<br/>is there to the vast difference between the &quot;musical distances&quot; of the two<br/>intervals?</p></div><h3><a id=9590 href="#9590">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

In such a scenario, what<br/>meaning<br/>&gt;&gt;is there to the vast difference between the &quot;musical distances&quot; of the two</p><p>&gt;&gt;intervals?</p><p>&gt;This is true, but it is playing with numbers. If one was working in a<br/>tuning that contained two such intervals, the &gt;musical context in which they<br/>would both occur at the same time is almost non existent. One can superpose<br/>any &gt;interval up to an extreme till they equal any interval one wants, but<br/>who is going to modulate that many places up &gt;till you get there.</p><p>One only has to go up two 3/2s and two 5/4s to find an interval (with the<br/>1/1) so close to 7/4 that the consonance of 7/4 greatly outweighs the<br/>largeness of the numbers in the actual interval, 225/128. That is only one<br/>of myriad examples.</p></div><h3><a id=9594 href="#9594">ðŸ”—</a>Paul H.

One can use an arbirtary function to limit it, say define consonance<br/>using 1/n and dissonance as 1-consonance. But again, getting too fancy with<br/>all this is not recommended because beyond ratios of 17 proximity to simpler<br/>ratios becomes as or more important than the numbers in the ratio itself.</p></div>
