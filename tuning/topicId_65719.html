I tried<br/>that, and it does work. Unfortunately, like a lot of demos it disables<br/>so many features it&apos;s hard to tell if it would really be useful to me,<br/>but it seems likely.</p><p>Here&apos;s the demo page:</p><p><a href="http://www.zero-g.co.uk/index.cfm?articleid=802">http://www.zero-g.co.uk/index.cfm?articleid=802</a></p><p>This gives you the demo version with the usual nearly useless and<br/>highly irritating piano roll editor. According to the documetation,<br/>pitch bending is possible, in the usual +-8192 format, but I don&apos;t see<br/>how to do it in the demo version. The full version is said to import<br/>midi files, and this is a feature it is crucial to check, so of course<br/>in their wisdom they haven&apos;t enabled it so one can see if it works or<br/>not. As is so often the case, they don&apos;t quote a price either.</p><p>However, the demo will allow you to create 12et pieces and export them<br/>as wav files.</p></div><h3><a id=65720 href="#65720">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>3/25/2006 12:32:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; As is so often the case, they don&apos;t quote a price either.</p><p>Most software I look at either quote a price or point to a<br/>distributor.
