It&apos;s that the frequency spectrum becomes more continuous and less discernible the higher we go. No-one would mistake a fifth as 2:3 with a fourth as 3:4. But what about 100:101 against 101:102 etc...? So there are certain advantages in having a mathematically rigorous method of &apos;mapping&apos; non-sequential large numbered ratios to the lower ones. And given that there are an infinite amount of possible ratios we need at least some guidelines. And why go only SO far? There is in principle an uncountably infinite number of these &quot;middle thirds&quot;. Is it &apos;closed-minded&apos; of us to select some and not others? Of course not. Hardly &quot;batty&quot; of me.</p><p>-Rick.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cameron&quot; &lt;misterbobro@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick, there are some huge and glaring problems in your paper, sorry to say. Right off the bat, determining whether a third is &quot;major or minor&quot; is just wacky, as middle thirds are completely normal for many millions, probably easily a billion and more, people, and have been since time immemorial.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I forgot to mention Mike that I did try a Fourier analysis of the first cycle but got nothing spectacular. Using Mathematica 7 I isolated the first cycle of 16:19, created a continuous period function from it and then took a Fourier series. It just punched out all the harmonics with a large amplitude at 16 and 19 as expected.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Rick<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Mike,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, it means allot coming from you. I was worried about phase-shifts (you read my mind?) so it&apos;s good to know that the results are general. And yes I agree that we don&apos;t want too much from a music &apos;theory&apos; because prior experience, context etc...is where the art must come in. I also figured that there still would be certain aspects of virtual pitch which are separate from what I&apos;m talking about and the distinction would come out eventually.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now I&apos;m not sure how to proceed via the frequency domain yet quite simply because there seem to be other cycles in the wave which I don&apos;t understand. 16:19 for eg has 5:6 on either side and 6:7 in the middle with a phase shift of the average frequency?? Yet other intervals give other results. I&apos;ll just plod away as I always do and hope that something jumps out eventually. In the meantime, I don&apos;t feel so lonely now knowing that others are working along similar lines.

Furthermore, I think that if<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you were to reformulate your ideas in a &quot;frequency domain&quot; perspective, I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think you&apos;d find that you&apos;re saying a lot of the same things that many here<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been saying as well, but in a different way.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In general I think your ideas are pretty solid here, with a few things to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consider:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) There are a few special cases in which I don&apos;t think the brain will<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always tend to the &quot;greatest&quot; common denominator. It&apos;s possible for a single<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isolated sinusoids to be heard as, say 3/1 with a &quot;virtual&quot; pitch being<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; produced at 1/1, even though no &quot;interval&quot; exists. Prior exposure and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; context can influence this.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) The phase of the sinusoids, for all intents and purposes, does not have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any bearing at all on the perception of the dyad. Two phase-shifted versions<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the same &quot;5/4&quot; dyad will NEVER seem to &quot;sync up&quot; visually, but it won&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matter.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Mike<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Wed, Feb 17, 2010 at 12:04 AM, rick &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi everyone,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;d just like to state that the approx.
