Many of these may be<br/>limited to 12-tone scales for the source<br/>scale (Emu for one).</p><p>Even if the synth can&apos;t do it, any synth that takes<br/>.tun files could be sent a command to switch .tun<br/>files.  In this case you make up a set of .tun files<br/>in advance, one for each key.

Also, thanks to criticism from the list, I&apos;ve adjusted my<br/>priorities a tad.  I figured it wouldn&apos;t hurt to post this here.  If anyone&apos;s interested in<br/>commenting, I&apos;d appreciate it.  Thanks.</p><p>Essentially, I&apos;m interested in having simple harmonic chords (at the *very least* to a 9-<br/>limit, but higher the better within practical considerations).  And the roots of these chords<br/>can be categorized into two categories that interest me most:  those that have 1/1 in their<br/>harmonic series (such as 8/5, 16/9, etc.), and those that are pythagorean above 1/1 (such<br/>as for a VI-II-V-I progression using 27/16-9/8 etc).  Then I add consideration for what are<br/>really &quot;non-harmonic tones&quot; which are dissonant in effect and function by their relation to<br/>nearby consonances.  The non-harmonic tones don&apos;t need to be exactly a certain note.  By<br/>being just sharp and then flattening until resolving into the harmony, that&apos;s the effect, and<br/>exactly how much isn&apos;t important.  Both melodic, harmonic, and root (like a whole chord<br/>being just sharp or flat of a normal place) non-harmonic concerns seem to be appropriate<br/>domain of the pitch bender, though I&apos;m really not completely certain about how to best do<br/>any of this.  I think that sums up what I want ideally, and I&apos;m just struggling to figure out<br/>how to practically access this.</p><p>I discussed possibilities of limited scale numbers, like 24, and using pitch bend to change<br/>the root of the whole system.</p><p>I know what I want in my head, and I have no problem typing in note by note annoying<br/>stuff to get it all to work, meaning playing live performances isn&apos;t a concern right now.<br/>My goal is simply two things: to be able to have something playable enough that I can go<br/>to my keyboard and fiddle around in order to try things and write stuff, and second to<br/>waste as little time as possible with setting the same pitch offsets again and again<br/>manually.  The better the overall workflow, the better the overall output will be.  But I<br/>know what I want in my head as far as note options, and I need to PLAY them on a<br/>keyboard or something in order to make sense of exactly how I want the music to go, and<br/>I want the fastest transition I can practically get from stuff in my head to actual sequenced<br/>music.</p><p>I&apos;ll leave it that open, and simply say that while I appreciate the value of tempering, I&apos;m<br/>really not into tempering in this case.  I&apos;m looking at strict JI.</p><p>Oh and the final thought:  I need a systematic thing that is flexible and really makes sense.<br/>I can&apos;t audition possibilities comfortably because everything is so different depending on<br/>the timbre of the audition sound!  So really, I&apos;ll need a broad enough system that I really<br/>don&apos;t feel I&apos;m having to audition and make such compromises.  I need to be able to access<br/>10/9 and 9/8 for example.  If one is easier than the other, fine.  But it can&apos;t be one or the<br/>other.  I need a way to get both.  Maybe that means way more than 24-notes.</p><p>Has anyone heard of any sequencer that can rename notes on a piano roll?  Like a virtual<br/>version of putting little pieces of tape on each key of a keyboard to label the note?</p><p>-Aaron</p><p>P.S. Geez, I meant to just post the one paragraph.  Sorry, I guess I couldn&apos;t contain myself.</p></div><h3>victorcerullo &#x3C;moog@libero.it&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2006 2:01:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron,</p><p>&gt; If I use Digital Performer and Max Magic Microtuner,<br/>&gt; is there a way that I can set up a MIDI signal to change .tun files?</p><p>Max Magic Microtuner allows you to keep up to five different<br/>Microtuner windows open at the same time, each of which catering for a<br/>different tuning if needed. If you configure a proper input channel<br/>matrix (via Preferences window) so to have window 1 receiving only on<br/>MIDI channel 1, window 2/channel 2 and so on, you can then use a<br/>footswitch to swap between channels for example. You may be able to<br/>configure your controller keyboard (also via software options on your<br/>sequencer) in a &quot;split channel&quot; mode and play different tunings with<br/>different sections on your keyboard. Possibilities are endless.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Victor</p></div><h3>Herman Miller &#x3C;hmiller@IO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2006 7:03:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt; Has anyone heard of any sequencer that can rename notes on a piano roll?

I found that Music Creator Pro24 2004 could still display the note labels if you edit the master.ins file by hand, but doesn&apos;t provide an interface for editing them. It also doesn&apos;t display note labels for DXi plugins, but only for MIDI outputs. But if you have some version of Cakewalk, check the master.ins file to see if it has a section labeled &quot;.Note Names&quot;. There&apos;ll be a bunch of sections like [General MIDI Drums] and so on, with all the names for the percussion instruments.</p><p>[General MIDI Drums]<br/>35=Acoustic Bass Drum<br/>36=Bass Drum 1<br/>....<br/>80=Mute Triangle<br/>81=Open Triangle</p><p>If you add your own note definitions, you can select them to display for a particular MIDI output from the Options/Instruments dialog box.
