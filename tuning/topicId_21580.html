There are 22 shruti-s.  They are classified into 5 groups for<br/>&gt; reasons of aesthetics. [This grouping especially needs further study].<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2.  9 shruti-s give rise to Sa-Ma interval, and 13 shruti-s, Sa-Pa<br/>&gt; interval.<br/>&gt; 3.  Out of those 22 shruti-s, 12 have been selected, to be called<br/>&gt; swara-s.  The swara-s are, first of all and most of all, shruti-s<br/>&gt; only, though they do assume additional significance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4. Shruti-s have a dual aspect: As the measurable, reproducible<br/>&gt; frequencies; and, secondly, as dynamic intonations. In the first<br/>&gt; case, the shruti-s are stand-alone; in the second, they can be, and<br/>&gt; are ONLY to be, percieved during a performance.  The performer does<br/>&gt; not start with a scale of 22 shruti-s; rather, he uses them with the<br/>&gt; only consideration of aesthetics in mind.  The performer can be<br/>&gt; completely ignorant, as far as using shruti-s is concerned.  However,<br/>&gt; he needs to be learned to study them in isolation, that is, as apart<br/>&gt; from performance.  The first is a technical measurement, the second<br/>&gt; is an aesthetic judgement; they go hand in hand. The performer can<br/>&gt; use a shruti lower or higher, depending upon the requirements and<br/>&gt; extent of flexibility of the raga or his aesthetic mood.  However,<br/>&gt; there are raga-s, which require use of only specific shruti-s: for<br/>&gt; example Todi, for its komal Re, komal Ga, and komal Dha. The<br/>&gt; performer shall not compromise in such cases.  Even the specificity<br/>&gt; of such shruti-s is a matter, eventually, of aesthetics.</p><p>Dear Haresh,</p><p>admittedly I am a) far away from the pertinent culture, b)<br/>interested in and fascinated by the idea of shruti as a measuring<br/>tool primarily. Initially I knew nothing about them except that<br/>there is no agreed upon explanation and that only a selection do<br/>occur in actual music. What I learned since then (like you, I<br/>started digging for texts and testing ideas last fall) is often at<br/>odds with your findings. I would like to add my doubts and<br/>convictions for discussion and refutation.</p><p>1.&#x9;I have never seen a reference to twelve svaras, they were always<br/>seven. However, Sarngadeva speaks of twelve modifications to the<br/>seven svara, making 19 in all (44c-46b). (The original sources I<br/>have lying around are the Sangitaratnakara and the Natya Sastra. I<br/>rarely read much of it sequentially, since I seem to grasp only the<br/>very basics in terminology. So my reading may be distorted!)<br/>I think that in the 19th century somebody collocated all the<br/>diatonic modes or went directly to the &quot;scientific&quot; European model<br/>of wholestep = 2 halfsteps, and then calculated all possible &quot;seven<br/>out of twelve&quot; scales with the single restriction that Sa-Pa or<br/>Sa-Ma or both must be samvadi. These are the ragas of Karnatic<br/>music, but they, too, have seven svaras (or six or five).</p><p>2.&#x9;The srutis as classified for asthetic effect add up to 22! This<br/>contradicts the idea behind my sruti-for-measurement thesis that<br/>some of them are never used. They also are grouped with certain<br/>svaras, implying they are pitch variations. This, however,<br/>contradicts the two vina experiment which, taken cum grano salis,<br/>makes it clear for me that they _appear_ to have equal distances<br/>(according to some undefined measuring method). Moot point?</p><p>3.&#x9;I think that there have been some number of historical<br/>redefinitions of the term &quot;sruti&quot;. In the beginning, they seem to<br/>have been used to outline different scale types. Whether Sarngadevas<br/>practice of altering some pitches (making it 19 used srutis, while<br/>classifying 22 - another contradiction?) is already a distortion, I<br/>am not sure. Very likely the whole system was adapted to<br/>Arabic-pythagorean theory in the mogul dynasty (Al Farabi mentions<br/>an older Arabian system of tuning the lute by subdividing a minor<br/>third six times - does anybody know more about this one?), then<br/>adjustments to the 12 tone keyboards of English use may have been<br/>made in theory and practice.<br/>Since authority is always gained by the elders, each new use of the<br/>term probably had to make the sruti 22, whether it made sense in the<br/>new context or not. So I would advocate a strict division of the<br/>different meanings.</p><p>Klaus</p></div><h3><a id=21583 href="#21583">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@microtonal.co.uk&#x3E;</h3><span>4/25/2001 8:31:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- klaus schmirler wrote:</p><p>&gt; 1.&#x9;I have never seen a reference to twelve svaras, they were always<br/>&gt; seven.</p><p>According the the Levy book, &quot;Pundarika Vitthala&quot; gives 7 suddha and 7<br/>vikrta svaras, but antara Ga and kakali Ni are omitted because they<br/>are too close to higher frets.
