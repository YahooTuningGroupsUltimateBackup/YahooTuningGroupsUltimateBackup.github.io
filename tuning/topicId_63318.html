My view is that music of that era was still primarily &quot;horizontal&quot; (i.e., based on polyphony), so it makes sense that the only notated part of continuo (in the sense of notes on a staff) was the bass line precisely because it was seen as the lowest voice among many voices.  In practice, a keyboard player realizing continuo had the freedom to improvise melodic voices as well as chords, so that the figures were just as much, if not more, to provide a harmonic context for improvisation as to indicate &quot;what chord to play&quot;.</p><p>Back in the 70&apos;s I spent a great summer as the stage manager for Aston Magna (<a href="http://www.astonmagna.org">www.astonmagna.org</a>) in Great Barrington, MA.

Rather,<br/>it is necessary to play through the 15 musical examples of the 1738<br/>document to see the situations where 6 chords are approached or<br/>exited, to figure out that he really was treating them as first<br/>inversion of the harmony.  It&apos;s crystal clear that way, without any<br/>&quot;mention&quot; in words.  The use of 6 chords (i.e. first inversion) in<br/>most of his situations gives a smoother and more melodic bass line,<br/>instead of making it leap around from root to root.

It was about the<br/>&quot;chord<br/>&gt; &gt;of the added 6th&quot;, i.e. the one that looks like 6/5 in the figured<br/>&gt; &gt;bass (6 above a 5).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;For example, put the note C in the bass line and 6/5 above it, so<br/>all<br/>&gt; &gt;the chord tones are C-E-G-A.  Is it still a C major chord with<br/>extra<br/>&gt; &gt;stuff mixed into it, or is it really (functionally) an A minor 7th<br/>&gt; &gt;chord in inversion?  That&apos;s the 18th century debate.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Rameau&apos;s way, that would be a souped-up C major chord, and the<br/>harmony<br/>&gt; &gt;that comes after it might well be a G major triad or G major 7th,<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt;the way back into a C major cadence.  Or it might go to A minor or<br/>&gt; &gt;somewhere else, directly from the 6/5 chord.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Bach&apos;s way, that 6/5 chord is already itself A minor with minor 7th<br/>&gt; &gt;(all in first inversion), and the next harmony to follow is<br/>typically<br/>&gt; &gt;D major or minor, with the bass moving to D.  The harmony is<br/>probably<br/>&gt; &gt;on the way toward G major, but via the dominant D first.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;There&apos;s a fundamental difference of root motion here, implicit in<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt;harmony of the 6/5 that sets it up.  This also has implications for<br/>&gt; &gt;the way the 5 of the first chord gets resolved...downward by step,<br/>&gt; &gt;since it&apos;s the 7th of a chord (the Bach way).  But Rameau didn&apos;t<br/>treat<br/>&gt; &gt;it functionally as a 7th.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;There&apos;s good presentation of this in Rita Steblin&apos;s dissertation,<br/>now<br/>&gt; &gt;a regular book in 2nd edition, _A History of Key Characteristics in<br/>&gt; &gt;the 18th and Early 19th Centuries_.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;The two Bach primers about figured bass are both in the older _Bach<br/>&gt; &gt;Reader_ (1960s) with a chapter heading introducing both together.<br/>&gt; &gt;This is not in the newer _New Bach Reader_ (Christoph Wolff&apos;s) for<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt;reason that is explained in the preface: it&apos;s published separately<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt;a facsimile edition by Pamela Poulin, 1994.

If there is only a 6 above the bass C, the<br/>&gt; &gt;harmony is A minor.  If we then add the note 5 into that, for the<br/>&gt; &gt;Bachs we are turning it into a 7th chord, still on A minor; for<br/>Rameau<br/>&gt; &gt;we are converting it into an enhanced C major chord.
