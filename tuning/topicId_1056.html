Their album &quot;Fly, Fly My Sadness&quot; (with Angelite) is one of my<br/>favorite albums. An article in a local paper had this to say about their<br/>music...(Ted Levin, who works with them, is the source of the quotes)<br/>&quot;This is music that&apos;s centered on a relationship to humankind and the<br/>forces of nature. The music comes out of a belief that the natural world<br/>is inhabited  by spirits, and that the way to establish contact  with<br/>that spirit world is to imitate the sounds of natural things. The music<br/>is absolutely, intimately connected with the landscape. That&apos;s what it&apos;s<br/>all about.&quot; This concept is actually quite common in many cultures<br/>around the world...music is intimately associated with spiritual<br/>matters; there is no separation. Unfortunately, this attitude has been<br/>lost, to a large degree, in today&apos;s &quot;modern&quot; culture...some folks think<br/>we have evolved beyond such &quot;primitive&quot; beliefs; but I think we have<br/>lost something of irreplacable value. The Tuvan&apos;s music could certainly<br/>be called &quot;minimal,&quot; if you will...very simple rhythms and melodies,<br/>nothing intellectually complex in the sense of advanced chords or<br/>scales. But, this is some of the most beautiful music I&apos;ve heard...it<br/>hits me in a place that has little to do with the logical, intellectual<br/>side of things.<br/>    The only drag was when one of the musicians used a 12 eq guitar to<br/>accompany some of the tunes...if there&apos;s one place where 12 eq is<br/>inappropriate, this is it...it changed the sound of the music, like<br/>putting it in a box. I don&apos;t know Tuvan tuning practices, but I&apos;m sure<br/>their tuning is closely related to simple ratios of the harmonic series.<br/>They are something else...Hstick</p></div>
