In particular, doubling the bonang an octave higher sounds wrong. But it does add an interesting texture to the music.</p><p>These instruments do sound better in bug temperament with more appropriate musical textures, but they could still use improvement. One of these days I&apos;d like to try some bug-based gamelan music, or maybe something in orwell.</p></div>
