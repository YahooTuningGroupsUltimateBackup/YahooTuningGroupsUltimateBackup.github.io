The Rousset is in an unequal<br/>tuning, and I would assume that the Gilbert is also.</p><p>Steven Kallstrom</p></div><h3><a id=10089 href="#10089">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;CLUMMA@NNI.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>5/20/2000 7:54:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;does any one know of some good recordings of Rameau and/or Couperin?<br/>&gt;Is it true that most &quot;original instrument&quot; recordings use period<br/>&gt;harpsichords tuned 12et?</p><p>That isn&apos;t true.</p><p>&gt;I have taped some Rameau in &quot;unequal tuning&quot;, don&apos;t remember who the<br/>&gt;harpsichordist was.

Jarrett is always getting lost anyway.</p><p>While I admit that Jarrett&apos;s Bach can be painfully lackluster, and his<br/>Shostakovitch outclassed, and his solo efforts a bit indulgent, I think<br/>it would be wrong to claim that his performance of Shostakovitch&apos;s 24<br/>preludes and fugues, or his Koln and Vienna concerts, are without merrit.<br/>Although I find it a bit of apples and oranges, I prefer them to what<br/>I&apos;ve heard of La monte young.  The only truely bad thing I&apos;ve heard out<br/>of Jarrett is his clavichord album.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=10244 href="#10244">ðŸ”—</a>Steven Kallstrom &#x3C;skallstr@sun.iwu.edu&#x3E;</h3><span>5/25/2000 8:05:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&#x9;This Jarrett bashing won&apos;t end.  I think that I agree with many<br/>positions given.  I think the thing to remember is that Jarrett is a<br/>&apos;third stream&apos; artist, a crossover performer.  I must say that his Jazz is<br/>quite nice and he has his place in that world.  His improv concerts may<br/>get long boring and uneventful, but there are lovely moments in these<br/>works, moments that can interest many composers.  In his classical<br/>performances he definately brings a very new and fresh<br/>perspective.  Stripping away the the performance practice issue, his<br/>interpretations do offer a somewhat spontaneous quality that could have<br/>only come from a prolific improviser.  His interpretations may not be<br/>standard and may not be great but he atleast makes us think about this<br/>where as many performers in this world bury there personality in the sand<br/>and mechanically pound out a tune.  I&apos;m not saying I like Jarrett, but I<br/>think there might by some value in everything he has produced.</p><p>Steven Kallstrom</p></div>
