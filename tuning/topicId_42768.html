At least a mild well<br/>temperament, one like my Very Mild Synchronous, or the Moore from the<br/>19th century, will work for anything as well or better than ET will.<br/>I don&apos;t mean to imply that a performance of Bach is<br/>100% &quot;historically informed&quot; if it is in some temperament other than<br/>what he used (apparently Werkmiester III), but it will be more<br/>historically informed by far in my synchonous wells than in equal<br/>temperament.</p><p>After all, my wells parallel quite plainly the general pattern of key<br/>color in Werkmeister III, as do a huge number of historical<br/>temperaments after Werkmeister. Also, the advantage of synchronicity<br/>is two-fold in this context:</p><p>1) It sounds better in tune (less harsh) in the remote keys than it<br/>would without beat synchrony</p><p>2) At the same time, the synchrony ironically makes the key color<br/>more obvious even in very mild temperaments, since the &quot;singing&quot;<br/>quality the vibrato-like synchrony lends to the voicing also<br/>manifests as an increasing harmonic/melodic intensity as the beat<br/>rate increases and leading tones narrow in more remote keys.</p><p>Also, there is no twentieth-century music, jazz, broadway, Bartok or<br/>anything else, that doesn&apos;t sound just fine, even enhanced, in this<br/>temperament. I tuned a friend&apos;s piano with my mild synchronous well<br/>and he felt Chopin sounded &quot;way better&quot; in this temperament than in<br/>ET. This is for the thirds on everything but C falling in a range<br/>from +9.7 to +17.2 cents (-4.0 to +3.5 cents deviation from ET), and<br/>the C is at +7.9. This is quite a mild temperament, and sounds even<br/>smoother and milder owing to the pleasant beat synchrony.</p><p>Please bear in mind that the average piano tuner tunes &quot;reverse<br/>wells&quot;. This means they tend to tune the fifths near C too cleanly<br/>and then iterate backwards to patch up the temperament setting and<br/>absorb the cumulative error. This places the MOST TEMPERED FIFTHS IN<br/>THE MOST REMOTE KEYS AND THE LEAST TEMPERED FIFTHS IN THE KEYS NEAR<br/>C. This is what Bill Bremmer calls a &quot;reverse well&quot;.</p><p>Even if the errors are random, the typical tuning errors made by<br/>average, mediocre tuning professionals lie OUTSIDE THE RANGE of my<br/>mildest temperament mentioned above. So no one has to even<br/>tell a client he&apos;s tuning my temperament instead of ET if he wishes<br/>to avoid a clash. There is a lot of conceptual resistance, as you<br/>must know, to anything other than ET, even if they can&apos;t hear diddly<br/>and would never know the difference if left to judge by ear.</p><p>So one strategy some leading-edge tuners are now implementing is to<br/>tune something mild without informing the client and then check the<br/>reaction. This was the impetus underlying the development of my<br/>mildest well. One top tuner kept pushing me for a highly synchronous<br/>well he could use this way. I&apos;m getting excellent feedback from<br/>several top professionals that clients love the tuning. Once you&apos;ve<br/>won them over, you can then take your time and gradually inform them<br/>about the alternatives, and if they resist, go back to ET. They will<br/>generally object, and say it sounds dead and flat. Thumbs UP! You&apos;ve<br/>won the day.</p><p>This is real feedback from people who are doing it. I am keenly<br/>interested in microtonal music, but I&apos;m also interesting in<br/>influencing the mainstream, common-practice musicians to think more<br/>about new tonal possibilities. This is part of my peaceful sneak<br/>attack. :)</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Bob</p></div>
