my own opinion on this specific example is that the Pythagorean<br/>&gt; comma is generally distinguishable but Mercator&apos;s comma is not.<br/>&gt; of course, whether or not either of these (or possibly other<br/>&gt; commas too) are distinguishable depends a great deal on musical<br/>&gt; context.  but in most cases i think Mercator&apos;s comma would not<br/>&gt; be noticed by a listener, and in an analysis would be assumed<br/>&gt; to vanish.</p><p>of course, if you temper the fifths, you can make mercator&apos;s comma,<br/>the pythagorean comma, or even the pythagorean limma vanish exactly,<br/>making distinguishability irrelevant. and if you make the pythagorean<br/>comma vanish, mercator&apos;s comma becomes a full semitone, and would not<br/>be assumed to vanish :)</p><p>&gt; my concept of finity depends on variables such as this.<br/>&gt; so it concerns not only the choices made for the rungs on the<br/>&gt; lattice, but also, the choices made for the *boundaries* of<br/>&gt; the periodicity-blocks.</p><p>what i was arguing is that finity has everything to do with the<br/>boundaries of the periodicity blocks (aka the unison vectors), so we<br/>appear to be in complete agreement on this. however, the choices made<br/>for the ji intervals comprising the set of rungs is a separate issue,<br/>and whatever they are, they could just as easily form the basis for an<br/>infinite-lattice conception of musical pitch resources, and/or one<br/>that derives scales from symmetrical lattice structures (i.e., the<br/>diamond, the eikosany and other CPS scales, stellated structures,<br/>etc.). thus my contention that the statement on your finity webpage<br/>about harmonic entropy &quot;rung&quot; wrong to my ears, since it suggests<br/>that harmonic entropy relates directly to the choices made for unison<br/>vectors (aka periodicity block boundaries).</p></div><h3><a id=41263 href="#41263">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/28/2002 1:36:28 PM</span><button style="float: right;
