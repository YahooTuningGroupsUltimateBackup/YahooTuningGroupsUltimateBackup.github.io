I didn&apos;t see it. Maybe one of the other lists?</p><p>Paul,<br/>This list: msg 25477 of Fri Jun 22, 200, particularily line no. 25.</p><p>George Zelenz:<br/>&gt;Saunders,<br/>&gt;what list had a post from (? i can&apos;t remember) that inferred you were &gt;probably a eunich?<br/>&gt;I seriously doubt your a eunich. But if you are, thats O.K. This list loves &gt;everybody.</p><p>Zelnez,<br/>I may or may not be a eunich, but you won&apos;t find that out so easily.</p><p>Jon Szanto:<br/>&gt;Michael, if you *do* happen to read this one, your reply did bring up<br/>&gt;an interesting thing about badly done amateur pieces, and you later<br/>&gt;clarified that you referred to inferior &apos;corporeal&apos; musics keeping<br/>&gt;your focus on the abstract. One would also hope that the badly done<br/>&gt;attempts won&apos;t forever take you away from an interest in non-abstract<br/>&gt;music, but the main point is that any era will have it&apos;s share of<br/>&gt;ineptitudes and charlatans. And my guess is that bad corporeal<br/>&gt;performances would at least be easier to find a laugh at than a bad<br/>&gt;abstract concert! &lt;g&gt;</p><p>Jon,<br/>Yeah---now that&apos;s interesting.  It&apos;s a question of emphasis---Partch, I&apos;m<br/>pretty sure, didn&apos;t think the abstract was _bad_, just overemphasized<br/>and badly done in his time.  I have the same sort of attitude, I think,<br/>only I believe the tables have turned and corporeal music is now more<br/>common.  This has a lot to do with a grounding in computer music,<br/>where a great deal of reverence is paid to musicians&apos; gestures (and hence,<br/>to flashy real-time hardware)---I&apos;m quite skeptical about that and though I<br/>think making musical gestures is fun, I don&apos;t think they&apos;re something<br/>too sacred to be automated (or too difficult).  Also, being concerned with<br/>composition algorithms, I&apos;m really fond of people being conscious of how<br/>their compositional process works.  I&apos;m not too impressed with the very<br/>common method of doodling undirectedly and keeping the good bits<br/>(neither the concept of that method or with its results, usually).<br/>Anyway, that&apos;s just my opinion.</p><p>&gt;It would be interesting to hear your particular musical path some<br/>&gt;day...</p><p>I&apos;ve been meaning to upload some things somewhere---maybe<br/>mp3.com---do you know if that&apos;s free?

Sprague:<br/>&gt;The media does this to everything of any complexity, partly because they &gt;haven&apos;t the time to understand what they are talking about and partly &gt;because they don&apos;t think their audience could understand anything &gt;complicated even if they could explain it in simple terms.</p><p>John,<br/>Yes! It&apos;s so frustrating! But I think the attitude is something more like this:<br/>Someone has discovered or invented something amazing, like life on Mars<br/>or a new kind of music, and the TV producer panics and thinks, &quot;How can<br/>I make this exciting?&quot;.</p><p>Kraig Grady:<br/>&gt;Michael!<br/>&gt;     Once again sorry you took it this way. You started off talking about &gt;the &quot;rare &quot; airing of<br/>&gt;Partch&apos;s Dreamer and such, and i happen to remember when they aired it &gt;quite frequently. I could<br/>&gt;not help and reflect on how his ideas over these years (you should see that &gt;i was reminiscencing<br/>&gt;with you ) are  suppressed by reducing him to nothing but a &quot;celebrity&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry Kraig, I just didn&apos;t see what it had to do with me or my post.<br/>Yes, I see what you mean now.  Maybe though, people who are genuine<br/>disciples are a bit hypersensitive to this, compared with the general<br/>musical public.  I suppose anyone&apos;s followers, Wagner&apos;s for example,<br/>often have cause to lament their man being misunderstood.  Maybe it&apos;s<br/>all part of a natural process of assimilation into the cannon. Anyway, I<br/>hope Partch&apos;s ideas end up informing a lot more mainstream music.<br/>The event I mentioned, btw, wasn&apos;t exactly an airing, it was an evening at<br/>a great musical venue called club lower links.  It was a magical scene, with<br/>all the local luminaries present---Hal Rammel, Hal Russel, Jim O&apos;Rourke,<br/>John Corbet, etc, etc.---one of those nights where you know half the<br/>audience from their own records.  You should have been there---minds<br/>were expanded!</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=25655 href="#25655">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2001 12:15:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Michael Saunders&quot; &lt;michaelsaunders7@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Paul Erlich:<br/>&gt; &gt;Are you sure that the message in which Kraig suggested you were a<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;follower&quot; of Partch was on<br/>&gt; &gt;this list?
