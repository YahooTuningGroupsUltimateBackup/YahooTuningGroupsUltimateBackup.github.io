Aside from whatever interest that might hold,<br/>it is interesting as an example of a constant structure scale which is<br/>not epimorphic, and for which even a rationally valued val does not<br/>exist. It is, in other words, very far from being epimorphic, but<br/>easily constant structure, being a slightly irregular Meantone[12] MOS.</p><p>! mean441.scl<br/>7-limit JI meantone, 441-et detempered<br/>12<br/>!<br/>16384/15309<br/>262144/234375<br/>1225/1024<br/>5/4<br/>8192/6125<br/>65536/46875<br/>6125/4096<br/>8/5<br/>2048/1225<br/>234375/131072<br/>15309/8192<br/>2</p></div>
