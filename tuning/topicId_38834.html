I have also included a clarification at the bottom from<br/>Gene that I received today. Posting this to elicit further discussion<br/>on Gram Points, The RZF, the critical strip, and everything, related<br/>to &quot;good&quot; tuning systems. I am admittedly confused by the fact that<br/>high values exist for Re(z)&gt;1, could this actually be Re(z)&lt;1? Seeing<br/>as the critical strip is 0&lt;Re(z)&lt;1 and this phenomenon extends &quot;into<br/>the critical strip.&quot; Any further commentary, Gene, or anyone?

It turns out the relationship extrapolates into the critical<br/>strip.</p></div>
