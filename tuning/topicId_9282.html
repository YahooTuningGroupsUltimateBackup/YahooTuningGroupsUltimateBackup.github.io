Briefly, it documents the<br/>career of Wesley Kuhnle (1898-1962), a Southern California performing<br/>musician who turned to research in early keyboard music. The Repository<br/>shows three specific concentrations: 1) his career as a performing musician<br/>and private music teacher; 2) his research on historic tunings and<br/>temperaments for keyboard music from the fifteenth to the late eighteenth<br/>centuries; and 3) his work on performance practices for early keyboard<br/>music. The Repository has been cited by Owen Jorgensen in his book, Tuning<br/>the Historical Temperaments by Ear, (No. Michigan University Press, 1977).<br/>The Repository contains fifty-six magnetic tapes relating to items 1 and 2<br/>above; correspondence including a complete set of letters from Kuhnle&apos;s<br/>study-tour to Berlin in 1923; 3) concert announcements, programs and<br/>reviews, 1921-1962; 4) musical arrangements and original compositions; 5)<br/>biographical records; 6) photographs, both personal of Kuhnle and his<br/>colleagues, particularly Henry Cowell and Richard Buhlig, as well as<br/>photographs of his mustcal instruments; 7) Kuhnle&apos;s personal llbrary; and 8)<br/>miscellaneous materials.</p></div>
