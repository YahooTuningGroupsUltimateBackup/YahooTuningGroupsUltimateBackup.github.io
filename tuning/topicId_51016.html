What&apos;s less<br/>well known, and in my opinion much more noteworthy, is that Reinhard<br/>has also suggested that there was an extended Pythagorean intonation<br/>latent in Ives&apos; often curious note spelling.</p><p>In 12-tone equal temperament enharmonic spellings like F# and Gb are<br/>always acoustically synonymous. In an extended Pythagorean intonation<br/>the sequence of fifths never closes as it does in 12-tone equal<br/>temperament, and enharmonic equivalencies are always acoustically<br/>distinct.

In TR #1<br/>and Halloween, John Kirkpatrick had respelled many of Ives&apos;s notes to<br/>make them more &quot;practical&quot; and more &quot;correct&quot; harmonically. The<br/>reason I spent so much time undoing all that foolishness was to make<br/>these Old editions in line with our new Ives Society guidelines. (We<br/>now preserve Ives&apos;s spelling, rhythms, and have a consistent format<br/>for describing details of the editing.)</p><p>Ives himself states his thinking in an Appendix to his &quot;Memos&quot;--flats<br/>represent repose and rest, sharps represent activity. I&apos;ve seen<br/>several places where a first draft uses flats, but the later and<br/>final drafts use sharps. C# is nearer to D than to C, etc., Db closer<br/>to C than to D. Hence that descending &quot;triad&quot; in &quot;West London&quot; b-ab-<br/>e. The &quot;3rd&quot; ab should be flatter than a &quot;proper&quot; g#.</p><p>It&apos;s Reinhard&apos;s premise that Ives harbored more than ideological and<br/>metaphysical ambitions when he spelled things as he did. In fact,<br/>it&apos;s Reinhard&apos;s expressed view that Ives&apos; unorthodox note spelling<br/>should be seen as a sort of Trojan horse that hid a specific and far-<br/>reaching organization of acoustical significance. In this sense an<br/>extended Pythagorean tuning--where an enharmonic # is always sharper<br/>than an enharmonic b, etc--lines up beautifully with certain<br/>anecdotal bits in the Memos and elsewhere. The only problem is that<br/>Ives never came right out and said &quot;Pythagorean&quot; himself, so the<br/>application of this premise will always invite controversy.</p><p>It shouldn&apos;t surprise anyone familiar with Ives that his own<br/>rationale for the note spellings offers arguments favorable to both<br/>corporeal and transcendental interpretation. But if the sheer volume<br/>of rhetoric given to each possibility is any indication, then Ives<br/>clearly hits his stride discussing the latter. Yet that&apos;s certainly<br/>true of Ives on the whole, and it should in no way obviate the fact<br/>that he did offer concrete--if something short of explicit--tuning<br/>data regarding his note spelling that can be acted upon by clever and<br/>resourceful persons such as Johnny Reinhard. If there&apos;s anything like<br/>a smoking gun regarding the exact acoustical significance of Ives&apos;<br/>note spelling, then it&apos;s my opinion that it might be found in a<br/>typewritten technical plan of the Concord Sonata that Ives mentions<br/>sending to Henry Bellamann in the Memos:</p><p>In the strings the chord Ab-Cb-Gb-Bb is a different chord from Ab-B-<br/>Gb-Bb (see typewritten copy sent to Bellamann of technical plan etc.<br/>of Sonata, with tone-vibration tables etc.)--the difference in its<br/>overtonal beats (actually measured vibrationally), especially if hit<br/>rather hard, is evident.</p><p>The example that Porter points out is a somewhat different beast<br/>however. In an extended Pythagorean tuning the only pure or beatless<br/>sonorities would be those based on the 2nd and 3rd harmonics. This is<br/>very much like a medieval tuning paradigm, only in medieval music<br/>thirds weren&apos;t considered consonances. But Ives, for all his abundant<br/>dissonance and harmonic experimentation, hardly shunned triads and<br/>their like in the militant manner of the first generation of<br/>atonalists. Yet by Reinhard&apos;s reckoning, major triads in an extended<br/>Pythagorean performance of Ives would employ thirds even wider than<br/>those of equal temperament; which is already quite sharp as regards<br/>sonorities involving the 5th harmonic. However, in the West London<br/>triad that Porter mentions the third is a schismatic third--one where<br/>the difference from a just third is a schisma, a tiny interval of<br/>approximately 2 cents. So in this case it could be said that Ives is<br/>exploiting a pure, just intonated triad by &apos;misspelling&apos; the third as<br/>a Pythagorean diminished fourth.</p><p>This is either a rarity in Ives, or something that was rather<br/>systematically edited out in an attempt to tidy things up. Either way<br/>it makes an interesting addendum to Reinhard&apos;s extended Pythagorean<br/>interpretation for Ives&apos; spelling/tuning template, and for anyone<br/>wanting to realize these implications in Ives, these recent critical<br/>editions--that preserve Ives&apos; original spellings, et al--will be a<br/>valuable addition to an oeuvre that still has some surprisingly fresh<br/>tricks up its sleeve.</p><p><a href="http://www.zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://www.zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a></p></div><h3><a id=51023 href="#51023">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@svpal.org&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2004 11:29:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot;<br/>&lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; To go along with the various clues and anecdotal indications that<br/>&gt; Reinhard has assembled along these lines, there&apos;s also some pretty<br/>&gt; solid empirical evidence that indicates there even may have been some<br/>&gt; JI (just-intonated) sonorities via schismatic spellings that were<br/>&gt; edited out of Ives.</p><p>Better yet, what about Ives in 94-equal, with very slightly sharp<br/>fifths to take better advantage of the 7-limit sonorities?

Welcome in advance ;)</p><p>&gt;As is usually the case with Ives, it&apos;s hard to tell for sure, even<br/>&gt;from the plentiful evidence at hand, because he embraced ambiguity<br/>&gt;and contradiction so thoroughly that it runs through almost every<br/>&gt;facet of his work.</p><p>    That is a reaaally nicely written &quot;nutshell&quot; essentialist definition of<br/>Ives as person and musician IMHO.</p><p>    Ok, here goes...<br/>     Ives - being a New Englander [like later iconoclastic poet e e cummings<br/>and collage artist Joseph Cornell] - was heavily influenced by the<br/>Transcendentalists (Emerson, Thoreau, Dickinson, Alcott and Co.) who were in turn<br/>influenced not only by New England&apos;s native Quakers and Unitarians but by the recent<br/>_attempted_ translations of Hindu and Buddhist &quot;mysticism&quot; (&amp; tiny bits of<br/>rather mangled&amp;butchered Chinese and Japanese poetry) [Over in Europe, even the<br/>infamous dark magus Aleister Crowley attempted his own translations, i.e the<br/>_Tao te Ching_.]<br/>    Philosopher William James&apos; _The Varieties of Religious Experience_,<br/>published in America in 1902, had the equivalent impact on American thought as<br/>French philosopher Henri Bergson&apos;s philosophy of _Elan Vital_ (also known in<br/>certain darker occult circles as _Vril_) had on Europe (and still does).</p><p>    So what&apos;s with all this &quot;density&quot; 0_o?<br/>    Quite simply Asian philosophy (&amp; languages themselves) embody the<br/>very/vary &quot;ambiguity and contradiction&quot; that Ives always found affective/effective<br/>and was always seeking in his life and music.</p><p>    So it would be absolutely interesting &amp; thrilling to have multiple<br/>viewpoints on Ives from all sorts of different Hindus... and likewise from Buddhists<br/>and Taoists, too --- i.e., Vedic concepts of _Nada Brahma_ &amp; _Lila_, Zen<br/>aesthetics, and the Taoist &quot;Music of Nature&quot; ideal... [[all which in turn had<br/>direct influence on John Cage and, to an arguably higher degree, Lou Harrison...<br/>ah!

Also: IIRC, film-maker Robert Altman&apos;s sound-on-sound<br/>concept was somewhat inspired by Ives (esp&apos;ly Altman&apos;s 1976 election year movie<br/>_Buffalo Bill and the Indians or Sitting Bull&apos;s History Lesson_)<br/>    ... &amp; IIRC Altman is a New Englander... or directly related/descended<br/>from them...<br/>    and Altman&apos;s genius with film sound editing influenced some &quot;ambient<br/>musics&quot;... like guitarist Henry Kaiser&apos;s soundtrack to _Rivers &amp; Streams_, the<br/>film about Andy Goldsworthy&apos;s emphermal nature-based artpieces made natural<br/>materials...</p><p>    One final thing: And I like this phrase you write elsewhereish: &quot;an<br/>oeuvre that still has some surprisingly fresh tricks up its sleeve.&quot;<br/>    Charles Ives as Trickster Archetype &quot;Incarnated&quot;...</p><p>    I better stop now before I give enough ideas for a goddam Ives<br/>encyclopedia...or at least a killer PhD thesis...or two...or... whatever!...<br/>        &amp; I gotta all-ways have some tricks up _my_ sleeves...<br/>---<br/>Z</p></div><h3><a id=51694 href="#51694">ðŸ”—</a>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2004 3:54:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for the input.
