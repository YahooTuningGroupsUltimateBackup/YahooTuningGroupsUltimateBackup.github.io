I won&apos;t<br/>spoil the answer for you Kraig should you decide to look into this<br/>yourself.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; If done as a recurrent sequence metameantone is done by exact-<br/>integers<br/>&gt; and allows for an infinate amount of such animals to seed it From:<br/>&gt; &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;wallyesterpaulrus@y...&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, your calculations are quite correct.
