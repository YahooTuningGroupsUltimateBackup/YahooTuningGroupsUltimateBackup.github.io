Quantum<br/>uncertainty is at an ontological level, and in this case, Joe is not<br/>concerned with the absence or presence of an interval, but rather amount of<br/>tolerance acceptable in the process of  its identification.</p><p>******<br/>I took LIME (a shareware notation program) out for a spin a while ago; for<br/>the price, it is very good.  If I hadn&apos;t invested already in Finale and<br/>Ghostscript (scores directly from algorithms), I would take this seriously.<br/>    It has midi implementation for microtones, but specified either exactly<br/>for FBO1s or as pitchbends for standard midi instruments</p><p>.</p></div>
