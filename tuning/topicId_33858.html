It seems we all agree on<br/>the<br/>&gt; approach of using accidentals to represent certain commas whether<br/>&gt; notating 11-limit JI or ETs. We even agree on which commas to use.<br/>We<br/>&gt; are only arguing over the choice of symbols (both real ones for<br/>rapid<br/>&gt; reading under poor conditions in scores, and their ASCII<br/>substitutes<br/>&gt; for email etc.).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Joe and Manuel are using one<br/>&gt; system, and you and others another, and this is confusing and<br/>&gt; unnecessary. Since they are so similar, it hardly makes sense to<br/>adopt<br/>&gt; a &quot;let&apos;s do both&quot; approach, which *would* make sense with George&apos;s<br/>&gt; notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Monz and Manuel are not using the same symbols.

And it would be more correct to notate Partch&apos;s scales<br/>&gt; with the 1/1 as &quot;G&quot;. Otherwise your notation looks fine to me.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I agree with Rappoport that &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot; are a very poor choice for<br/>actual<br/>&gt; scores due to possible merging with staff lines and confusion with<br/>&gt; ledger lines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I had a dollar for every time I&apos;ve _written_ the wrong one<br/>of &quot;/&quot;<br/>&gt; and &quot;\&quot;, let alone _read_ them wrong ... and I&apos;m not even trying to<br/>&gt; sight-read them on scores.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s those damn up and down arrows that are causing all the<br/>problems.<br/>&gt; They are by far the most obvious accidentals available in ASCII<br/>which<br/>&gt; are not left-right confusable, which is probably one reason why<br/>&gt; different people have used them for just about everything. The fact<br/>&gt; that people _have_ used them for just about everything means we can<br/>&gt; pretty much ignore any particular claims regarding their historical<br/>&gt; usage.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; George Secor, do the semantics of these 11-limit systems agree with<br/>&gt; yours, as far as they go?</p><p>Dave &amp; Gene,</p><p>Over the weekend I finally settled on how I would notate 46 and 53-<br/>EDO with the sagittal symbols, which was a challenge, since they<br/>divide the sharp and flat alterations into five parts.  For these<br/>(and for 96) I decided to employ symbols that I was previously using<br/>in the 41-EDO native notation, but with a slightly different meaning,<br/>which I will specify below.  (And I also removed those extra symbols<br/>from the 41-EDO native notation, for which I now prefer to use only a<br/>subset of the 72-EDO symbols.)</p><p>Rather than go into a lot of explanation about this, why don&apos;t I just<br/>direct you to:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/EDOvsJI.doc">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/EDOvsJI.doc</a></p><p>from which you can print out full-octave diagrams of 72, 41, 31, 22,<br/>46, and 96 for study.</p><p>Having finally decided on all of this, I can now commit to the<br/>semantics of the sagittal notation.  So we don&apos;t have any<br/>misunderstandings, I will start from the very beginning.</p><p>There are 7 nominals in a Pythagorean series of fifths from F to B.<br/>A sagittal sharp /||\ or flat \||/ alters by a Pythagorean chromatic<br/>semitone (2187:2048) and the double sharp/flat by twice that.</p><p>A left (Didymus) flag symbol /| (up) or \| (down) alters by 81:80.<br/>A right (Archytus) flag symbol |\ (up) or |/ (down) alters by 64:63.<br/>An up /|\ or down \|/ arrow (combination of the two flags) alters by<br/>a unidecimal diesis (33:32), which conflates 385:384.</p><p>If the notation is used for a system in which a fifth is an even<br/>number of degrees (e.g., 17, 31, 41, or 72-EDO), then the number of<br/>system degrees that a sharp or flat alters is also even (being equal<br/>to 7f-4n, where f is the number of degrees in the fifth and n is the<br/>number of degrees in the octave).  In this case, a sagittal sharp or<br/>flat will be twice the alteration of the unidecimal diesis, which<br/>conflates 243:242.</p><p>In systems having a decent representation of 11:9, but having a fifth<br/>with an odd number of degrees (e.g., 46 or 53-EDO), I have employed<br/>some of the extra symbols (discarded from my tentative 41-EDO native<br/>notation) to indicate what amounts to a sharp less a unidecimal<br/>diesis (or flat plus a unidecimal diesis); this can be observed in<br/>the 46-tone full-octave diagram (don&apos;t strain your eyes on the<br/>screen; print it out!): Pythagorean E-flat is 11 degrees above C, and<br/>11/9 (33:32 up) is 13 degrees; the latter uses a two-stroke symbol<br/>with a reverse-facing arrow, indicating a decreased alteration in<br/>comparison to the sagittal flat.</p><p>I am going to have to define this amount of reverse alteration as two<br/>Didymus commas rather than a unidecimal diesis.  This permits<br/>consistent employment of all of the extra symbols to notate 96-EDO<br/>(Didymus comma = 1 degree, Archytas = 3 degrees, unidecimal diesis =<br/>4 degrees) and 48-EDO (as a subset of 96).  Both of these are<br/>inconsistent at the 7 limit, but the symbols do a very nice job with<br/>them, which brings us very close to saying that the sagittal notation<br/>can &quot;do it all.&quot;  (Also see the complete octave diagram for 96-EDO.)</p><p>&gt; Is there any chance that you could rework<br/>&gt; your set of symbols so that it becomes an extension of the<br/>Sims/Maneri<br/>&gt; notation and doesn&apos;t contain any pairs of symbols which are left-<br/>right<br/>&gt; confusable, or n_n+1 confusable for n&gt;=2?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Notice how few such pairs of symbols there are in any real alphabet<br/>or<br/>&gt; set of numerals. In ours: Left-right: bd pq. Note that slanting<br/>these<br/>&gt; helps to remove the left-right-confusability. FE and nm would be 2-<br/>3<br/>&gt; confusable if one of their strokes was not made different from the<br/>&gt; others. SZ JL 3E 5Z would be LR-confusable if one of each pair was<br/>not<br/>&gt; angular while the other was curved.</p><p>I said that if anyone came up with any recommendations as to how the<br/>sagittal notation could be improved, I would be happy to consider<br/>them.  That time has come.</p><p>For reasons that I have already covered, I do not consider<br/>compatibility with the Sims/Maneri symbols an improvement; whereas<br/>those symbols are almost completely arbitrary, there is not a single<br/>line in any of the sagittal symbols that is arbitrary or capricious --<br/> everything has a meaning that allows the notation to be applied<br/>consistently and intuitively to a diversity of EDO&apos;s.</p><p>As long as you&apos;re using 12-EDO instruments with extended techniques<br/>to get microtones (just as our predecessors made do with valveless<br/>brass instruments in centuries past to get the &quot;missing&quot; tones<br/>however they could), then Sims/Maneri will do.  But once the<br/>microtonal breakthrough comes (and if you don&apos;t ever expect it to<br/>come, then you might as well log off and find something else to give<br/>you your jollies), and once we realize that there might be easier and<br/>better ways to achieve it, then we are going to want some real<br/>microtonal instruments (multi-system, if you please), and we are<br/>going to want a notation that is going to serve them well.  The new<br/>notation can then be learned as a part of the process of learning the<br/>new instruments.  (Or, for those so inclined to get a head start, it<br/>can be learned now, so that there will already be a group of people<br/>familiar with it when the time comes.)  I would like to see that<br/>there is a comprehensive plan ready to be implemented when this<br/>happens, which is why I&apos;ve been pursuing this approach.</p><p>Re left-right-confusability:  Last night I tried a couple of ways to<br/>distinguish the laterally mirrored pairs of symbols.  One was to give<br/>half of them an &quot;ugly makeover&quot; by making the diagonal lines much,<br/>much thicker; it looked -- well, ugly!  The other was to give the<br/>diagonal lines a curve, but is it enough?  I&apos;ll let you judge.  If<br/>you look at</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/Figures.bmp">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/Figures.bmp</a></p><p>you will now see Figure 4a, which is a revision of Figure 4, which I<br/>left there so you can see what was there before.  The modified<br/>symbols are in the 72-tone line.  I selected the ones that I modified<br/>on the basis of what least occurs in the native notations, so the<br/>only place that these modified symbols are used in native notations<br/>is for 36, 72, and 96-EDO.</p><p>The net effect of this is that, in the (72-EDO) transcendental<br/>notation, the modified symbols will identify tones that differ from<br/>the Pythagorean series (extended ratios of 3) by an Archytas comma<br/>(64:63), or that differ from ratios of 11 by a Didymus comma.  So<br/>those curved lines do provide a useful function in addition to<br/>distinguishing left from right.</p><p>So, that was a pretty good suggestion you made, Dave!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2002 2:42:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px;

However, what I will be writing will not<br/>be impractical for or unperformable on new acoustic instruments, and<br/>a major objective that I have in mind is to write music that people<br/>will *want* to hear on acoustic instruments, thus creating a demand<br/>for them (on the assumption that &quot;real&quot; instruments will be preferred<br/>to an electronic &quot;imitation&quot;).  (You also mentioned something similar<br/>to this below, but stopped short of my objective.)</p><p>&gt; what i&apos;ve suggested in the past is that pushing for a single and<br/>&gt; inclusive-of-present-practice new microtonal system, namely 72-<br/>equal,<br/>&gt; may be a more realistic and sellable goal for the present<br/>generation<br/>&gt; of acoustic instrumentalists. the music of partch, wychnegradsky,<br/>&gt; xenakis and others can serve as an adequate demonstration of the<br/>type<br/>&gt; of effects and emotions achievable in 72-equal, while an entire<br/>&gt; lifetime of musical training in 12-equal continues to be<br/>applicable.</p><p>In my first several years of microtonal experimentation, I felt that<br/>common sense dictated that 22 was the upper limit of what I would<br/>consider a reasonable number of tones per octave, and as the years<br/>passed I raised this to 31 and finally 41.  This was on the basis of:<br/>1) what can we be expected to hear? and 2) what can we be expected to<br/>handle?  I strongly believe in 72 as a basis for notation, but using<br/>this as a standard system for microtonal performance is another<br/>matter.  Can we expect a significant number of composers and<br/>musicians to buy the idea that 72-EDO is practical outside of the<br/>electronic medium?</p><p>&gt; meanwhile, i&apos;ll happily continue making my own music on my own<br/>&gt; instruments in 22- and 31-equal, and others will do similar things,<br/>&gt; no doubt. the revolution you&apos;re looking for, if it occurs, will<br/>have<br/>&gt; to be rooted in musical practice, or the edge of practice, that is<br/>of<br/>&gt; concern to musicians. a complex system of several large<br/>interlocking<br/>&gt; equal temperaments will need a particularly convincing body of<br/>music<br/>&gt; close to the hearts of many performers to &apos;sell&apos; them on it. but of<br/>&gt; course the music is difficult to produce *before* the instruments<br/>&gt; have even been implemented. so it seems like a rather<br/>insurmountable<br/>&gt; hurdle.</p><p>The classic chicken-egg problem.</p><p>&gt; the electronic path seems the natural one to go down to jump<br/>hurdles<br/>&gt; like these. you can invent a whole new musical culture within your<br/>&gt; computer. and once the music is there, it&apos;s there, it doesn&apos;t need<br/>to<br/>&gt; be sight-read, instruments don&apos;t need to be invented and<br/>&gt; learned . . . the composer will be freed from all<br/>&gt; the &apos;intermediaries&apos; in the way of translating a musical idea to<br/>&gt; aural reality. this is the future that we seem to be on the brink<br/>of.</p><p>Yet I am hoping that if the music produced by electronic means is<br/>good enough, there will be a demand for acoustic instruments that are<br/>capable of producing it.</p><p>&gt; anyway, just some rambling devil&apos;s advocate thoughts for you . . .</p><p>In many ways we are not very far apart from each other in what we<br/>would like to achieve, so ramble on!</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2002 12:53:13 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; i&apos;m not<br/>&gt; &gt; convinced that having all these *equal-tempered* systems (and<br/>there<br/>&gt; &gt; would have to be an arbitrary pitch standard for all of them,<br/>like<br/>&gt; a-<br/>&gt; &gt; 440) would be very representative of what all microtonal<br/>composers<br/>&gt; &gt; will want, and what is likely to be realized. how would you<br/>notate<br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; shift from one system to another if the common tone were not a-<br/>440<br/>&gt; or<br/>&gt; &gt; whatever you&apos;re using as your standard? considerations like these<br/>&gt; led<br/>&gt; &gt; me to propose 76-equal and 152-equal as the best *closed* tuning<br/>&gt; &gt; systems which will allow me to use a large number of the<br/>&gt; &gt; melodic/harmonic systems i&apos;m interested in (both in strict and in<br/>&gt; &gt; adaptive forms) and allow me to connect them via any pitch. can<br/>&gt; your<br/>&gt; &gt; notation deal with these well?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Are you suggesting a *transfer* (that&apos;s the term Ivor Darreg<br/>&gt; proposed) in mid-composition from one tuning system to another?

I   for<br/>one am very grateful for your core idea, which is to base the notation<br/>of ETs on Pythagorean plus the commas 80:81, 63:64, 32:33.</p><p>This is sort of a combination of Manuel Op de Coul&apos;s idea (or was it<br/>someone else&apos;s originally?) to notate 11-limit JI using Pythagorean<br/>plus accidentals to represent these 3 commas up and down (and a<br/>redundant pair for 125:128 for convenience), with Paul Rapoport&apos;s idea<br/>that ETs should be notated based on commas. He chose all 5-limit<br/>commas: 80:81, 125:128, 2025:2048, 32768:32805, all of which vanish in<br/>12-tET.</p><p>This is all the more impressive since you didn&apos;t know about either of<br/>these at the time.</p><p>You will see that Gene and I have taken this idea and are running with<br/>it. The part we don&apos;t buy is that combinations of these commas and<br/>sharps and flats should always be notated as a single symbol, even<br/>though you have reduced the number of combinations by assuming certain<br/>even smaller commas always vanish, such as 384:385.</p><p>We figure that limiting ourselves to at most two accidentals against<br/>any note (and one of those usually # or b) is quite enough and has a<br/>solid track record.</p><p>I feel that by trying to pack too much information into a single<br/>symbol you are losing readability and throwing away established<br/>symbols to no great gain.</p><p>I suspect that as you try to consistently notate more and more of the<br/>ETs below 41, you will find you need more and more symbols. By keeping<br/>the comma symbols separate we have all possible pairs<br/>already available.</p><p>It&apos;s interesting to consider whether native readers of Chinese or<br/>Japanese would be more at home with your single-symbol system rather<br/>than the max-two-symbol system Gene and I are working on. But I<br/>suspect westerners will prefer the latter.</p></div><h3>Gerald Eskelin &#x3C;stg3music@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2002 8:05:39 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/13/02 1:54 PM, &quot;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Message: 20<br/>&gt;  Date: Wed, 13 Feb 2002 20:53:13 -0000<br/>&gt;  From: &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paul@stretch-music.com">paul@stretch-music.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Notation individualists<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; it&apos;s already happening -- at new england conservatory, at the richter-<br/>&gt; herf institute, among byzantine choral directors such as g. bilalis,<br/>&gt; etc. etc. perhaps you&apos;d like to contact julie werntz again (you<br/>&gt; contacted her already, didn&apos;t you) and ask her this question.</p><p>A byzantine choral director?

As someone who often leans toward a kind of JI<br/>based on ratios of 2-3-7-9, I&apos;m delighted to have the difference<br/>between steps of 9:8 and 8:7 associated with a theorist famed for<br/>favoring these steps. We speak of the comma of Didymus, and George<br/>Secor has given credit where credit is due in naming this other<br/>notable comma most appropriately.</p><p>When I wrote some articles a bit more than a year ago on a JI system<br/>with two 12-note Pythagorean chains a 63:64 apart, I noted that it<br/>made available tetrachords identical to those of Archytas -- the term<br/>&quot;comma of Archytas&quot; is something that I would like to have had<br/>available then, and now it is, thanks to your inventing it (I wonder<br/>if there are any precedents -- in any event, it&apos;s about time).</p><p>Now for sagittal notation in 46-EDO: one of the strengths of this<br/>system is that it&apos;s very intuitive for me as someone following a<br/>neo-medieval kind of outlook not necessarily the conventional wisdom<br/>in this forum or elsewhere.</p><p>First, the 5d46 modifications up or down (&quot;five degrees of 46,&quot; with<br/>my ASCII &quot;d&quot; imperfectly representing a degree symbol) are in fact<br/>equivalent to familiar sharps and flats -- new symbol, friendly and<br/>familiar concept.</p><p>Secondly, I find that many of my likeliest notes and intervals to use<br/>translate very simply into the sagittal notation. Sometimes a<br/>conventional spelling using only sharps or flats neatly solves the<br/>problem, and sometimes a diesis modification provides a ready<br/>alternative: but lots of points on my grid are nicely covered by one<br/>approach or the other.</p><p>That&apos;s my opening accolade, and I look forward to your more thorough<br/>exposition to which I may add some musical examples from my own<br/>stylistic point of view.</p><p>Mainly, I want to say: this is a beautiful notation that meets me, as<br/>one user, more than halfway. I look forward to sharing some musical<br/>examples, and congratulate you upon this elegant achievement.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>gdsecor &#x3C;gdsecor@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2002 1:49:56 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;dkeenanuqnetau&quot; &lt;d.keenan@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; George Secor, do the semantics of these 11-limit systems agree with<br/>&gt; yours, as far as they go?

At least then you wouldn&apos;t need<br/>symbol pairs for the variable fraction of every comma.</p><p>The way I see it, calling it a _variable_ fraction of some particular<br/>5-limit comma (there is sometimes more than one to choose from) is no<br/>less specious than calling it a whole comma involving some higher<br/>prime.</p><p>&gt; &gt;Some N-ET&apos;s should only be notated as every kth step of kN-ET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You probably write &quot;should&quot; because of your consistency requirement<br/>&gt; for the commas used, which I don&apos;t share.</p><p>Not for that reason, although I value 1,3,9-consistency in this<br/>regard, so that one can assume for example that C:D is a 1:9 while<br/>both C:G and G:D are 2:3s. Sometimes enough primes are consistent but<br/>I still wouldn&apos;t notate the ET using its own best approximation of a<br/>2:3 because this approximation is a very poor one. This was Dan<br/>Stearns excellent suggestion. He&apos;d rather know that some tunings have<br/>a super and a sub fifth, than pretend that one of them is a perfect<br/>fifth. 47-tET is a borderline example of that. And if we notate 11-tET<br/>according to its native &quot;perfect fifth&quot; (instead of that of 22-tET) we<br/>obscure the fact that it has reasonable 1:7:9:11 chords.</p><p>&gt; How would your system<br/>&gt; take care of for instance 105-tET?</p><p>Ok. So this ET is absolutely dismal on the low number consistency<br/>front. Neither 1,3,5 nor 1,3,7 nor 1,3,9 nor 1,3,13, and the proposed<br/>17 and 19 commas are a negative number of steps. So I&apos;m left with only<br/>the undecimal diesis [] at 4 steps (the proposed 23-comma is also<br/>4-steps).</p><p>But it&apos;s perfect fifth is essentially that of 2/9-comma meantone and<br/>many of its second-best approximations are quite acceptable. Because<br/>its perfect fifth is good I see no reason to notate it as every 2nd<br/>step of 210-tET or any such.</p><p>Presumably you would use the diesis (3 steps) and 1/n-diesis (in this<br/>case 1/3-diesis = 1 step) symbols. I guess one never needs to ask<br/>whether the diesis will be consistent since it is only a 1,5-comma not<br/>1,3,5, (except in the unlikely event that you&apos;re worried about 1,5,25<br/>consistency). This is a nice feature.</p><p>Oh well, I guess in this case I&apos;ll choose the values I want from some<br/>inconsistent commas. See, I said it wasn&apos;t a dogma. :-)</p><p>The syntonic comma is 0 steps for best 1:5s and 1 step for best 3:5s.<br/>The septimal comma is 3 steps for best 1:7s and 4 steps for best 3:7s.<br/>I&apos;ll use the septimal comma symbols &lt;&gt; to mean 3 steps and the<br/>syntonic comma symbols v^ to mean 1 step. So we have</p><p>D D^ D&gt;v D&gt; D] Ebv Eb Eb&lt; Eb&lt;^ Ebv Eb Eb^ E[v E[ E&lt; E&lt;^ Ev E</p><p>with the identities<br/>&gt;^ = ]<br/>&lt;v = [<br/>#&lt; = ]<br/>b&gt; = [</p><p>So we could do without the [] if we want and accept the occasional<br/>triple accidental.</p></div><h3>dkeenanuqnetau &#x3C;d.keenan@uq.net.au&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2002 10:26:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;gdsecor&quot; &lt;gdsecor@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Per your suggestion, I tried reworking them in two different ways in<br/>&gt; Figures 4a and 4b:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/Figures.bmp">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/files/secor/notation/Figures.bmp</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I previously hesitated to make them as you suggested above (see 4b)<br/>&gt; because this makes the new symbols somewhat larger than others that<br/>&gt; signify pitch alteration by a greater amount.</p><p>So why not use the curved strokes for the septimal comma and the<br/>straight ones for the syntonic comma, since the septimal comma _is_<br/>bigger and represents twice as many steps in 72-tET.</p><p>&gt; I think that making<br/>&gt; the curve in the opposite direction (as in 4a) better preserves the<br/>&gt; size/alteration correlation.
