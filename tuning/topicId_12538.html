I thought that was why we<br/>wanted to find something _universal_ that would be easily<br/>performable.

I believe<br/>it was Kraig Grady who was a bit offended by this.  And also, Paul<br/>Erlich doesn&apos;t like 24-tET.  But not ME.  I&apos;ve been using it as a<br/>starting point after your original suggestions...</p><p>&gt;My usage of 50 cent symbols is based on lots of trial and error with<br/>&gt;many different players.  It makes reading easier and more accurate<br/>&gt;earlier on in rehearsal.</p><p>But I thought many of us felt that the &quot;quartertone +&quot; notation WAS<br/>the easiest way for the professional musician!  The QUESTION was<br/>whether it should be &quot;quartertone +/- &lt;51&quot; or &quot;quartertone +/- &lt;26.&quot;</p><p>Joe Monzo, logically, advocates the latter...</p><p>&gt; Sometimes a C# is higher than a Db, sometimes lower.  This notation<br/>allows specificity by acknowledging the identity ALREADY acknowledged<br/>by players.</p><p>Yes, so you are saying that they mean something SPECIFIC... They are<br/>not interchangable.  That&apos;s been my point, and Monzo&apos;s all along...<br/>So there should be no reason to have two different notations for the<br/>SAME pitch... two notations should only &quot;prescribe&quot; two DIFFERENT<br/>pitches...</p><p>&gt; It is only for them that I use these symbols.  I use them for<br/>myself, and I&apos;ve tried many different notations in my polymicrotonal<br/>music.  When I speak to players about it, they understand easily what<br/>I am getting at.</p><p>But, more easily than the 72-tET school??  Have you TRIED 72-tET with<br/>your players?  I would hesitate to think that they would be teaching<br/>this system at the New England Conservatory if it were entirely<br/>without merit.</p><p>__________ _____ __ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
