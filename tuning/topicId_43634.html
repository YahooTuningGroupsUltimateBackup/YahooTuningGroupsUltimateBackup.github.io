And the truth is; after a point, harmonic concepts of<br/>&quot;limit&quot; become completely irrelevant, and the numbers serve the sole function<br/>of being irreducible scale degree generators. A major part of the interest in<br/>this kind of exploration of high prime rational intonation, is to see the<br/>many audibly &quot;identical&quot; intervals, along side of many that are either very<br/>close to lower<br/>number ratios, or ones which are altogether alien to the language of<br/>3-5 limit Just Intonation. &lt;&lt;</p><p>&lt; SNiP &gt;<br/>&gt;over on the specmus list, martin braun has been claiming that the<br/>&gt;latest neurological evidence shows that we preferentially respond to<br/>&gt;the 3rd, 4th, and 5th harmonics (and are aided by a hard-wired<br/>&gt;octave-equivalence mechanism) in our efforts to determine the pitches<br/>&gt;of instrumental and vocal tones. however, martin has claimed a lot of<br/>&gt;things . . .</p><p>    So Braun is still diggin&apos; at that fringe deterministic theory, eh? He<br/>must be looking for some kind of deep (self-)rationalization for &quot;musical<br/>universals&quot; - how the hell does he explain non-just/nonET scales that appear<br/>in {quoting Brian McLaren} &quot;examples (some outside Africa): The panpipes of<br/>the &apos;Are-&apos;are of the Solomon Islands are tuned in 7 equal-tempered tones to<br/>the octave which cannot be understood in terms of the harmonic series<br/>(unless, of course, there&apos;s something I&apos;ve overlooked or not taken account<br/>of--always possible); the same seems to be true of the xylophones of the<br/>Kwaiker indians of central Mexico and Guatamala. The Burmese oboe-like<br/>instruments, the drums of the Akan in West Africa, and much of the vocal<br/>music of the Kaluli of highland New Guinea and other music from sub-Saharan<br/>Africa all seem to use pitches which systematically avoid just ratios. Of<br/>course the most spectacularly non-just non-equal-tempered musical traditions<br/>are those of Bali and Java, along with Thailand. No one has succeeded in<br/>explaining these musical traditions in terms of small integer ratios, to the<br/>best of my knowledge, and so my case seems to stand.&quot;</p><p>    I&apos;d sooner believe neurological preference for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th<br/>harmonics and &quot;a hard-wired octave-equivalence mechanism&quot; is because of<br/>genetic memory and level(s) of socio-cultural assimilation - compounded by<br/>personal choice - more than anything else.<br/>    This is just my theory using a very extreme analogy: many people have the<br/>gene that creates serial child rapist/killers, but only a very small marginal<br/>percentage ever become &quot;sickf*cks.&quot;  *  Socio-cultural assimilation and<br/>personal choices prevent most of these people from becoming such monsters -<br/>the indeterminism of environment and ethics triumphs over the determinism of<br/>genetics.<br/>    _Mutatis mutandi_ for musical perception, curiosity, comprehension<br/>/understanding and aesthetics... and pretty much everything else that makes<br/>us Higher Primates Human Beings (sorta related;) :<br/><a href="http://www.abslogic.com/AnimalArt.htm">http://www.abslogic.com/AnimalArt.htm</a> ).</p><p>    *  (A HongKong-born Cantonese friend of mine jokes bittersweet the reason<br/>Europeans colonized most of the world and &quot;f**k-uped the environment&quot; is<br/>because their ancestors spent many more eons in caves than any other people:<br/>&quot;After several hundred generations cooped up in caves cowering from every<br/>other human,... predatory animal,... shaft of lightning and rain storm and<br/>such, everyone is a bit permanently,... neurotically,... _stir-crazy_ as<br/>ape-sh*t.
