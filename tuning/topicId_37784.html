Currently, retuning the<br/>samples microtonally is extremely time consuming (300,000 manual<br/>operations to retune a single string library, for example). They&apos;re<br/>working on version 3 now, and I&apos;ve asked them to make it possible to<br/>create templates into which exisiting sound libraries can just be<br/>poured into automatically for retuning.<br/>Please, if this possibility interests you, e-mail <a href="mailto:custser3@tascam.com">custser3@tascam.com</a><br/>very soon and tell them that you work with [ethnic, music,<br/>microtonal] music and are considering buying Gigastudio but want to<br/>know if it is easy to retune samples automatically from their sound<br/>libraries! If they add this feature, I honestly believe this will be<br/>an incredibly rich source of musical inspiration for microntonalists<br/>of all stripes.<br/>Thanks in advance for your help,<br/>Chris Mohr</p></div><h3>jonszanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2002 8:48:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;fromtherealmoftheshadow&quot; &lt;fromtherealmoftheshadow@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Gigastudio has an incredible sound sample library, and the new<br/>&gt; Version 3 may become microntonal-friendly!</p><p>And the rest.

Thanks for your offer to spread the word!</p><p>No problem, Chris. Stop in and see if anyone answers. Also, you should do an archive search in that group on samplers, because a couple of times this has come up in the past with both hard- and software samplers, and you might find some answers there. Also, there have been a few people actively involved in contacting manufacturers of software on microtuning support, check that out.</p><p>And if all else fails, I have a guy no longer on-list that I can ask if it doesn&apos;t clear up - he&apos;s my &quot;ace in the hole&quot;!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
