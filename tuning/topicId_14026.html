It&apos;s a great solution to situating the genera in a 2D space. I don&apos;t<br/>know if I&apos;m completely getting it though: it seems you call the 3<br/>intervals which add up to 500 cents a, b and c. Anything along the / side<br/>has a=0, anything along the _ side has c=0, and anything along the \ side<br/>has b=0. The distance from the _ side, measured perpendicular to _, is the<br/>size of the interval c. The distance from /, measured perpendicular to /,<br/>gives the size of a. And likewise for \ and b. Consequently the /\ tip<br/>should be all c (i.e. a=0, b=0, c=500), the /_ corner should be all b, and<br/>the _\ corner should be all a. These last two are reversed on the diagram,<br/>so I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m understanding it right. Can someone set me<br/>straight?</p><p>also, shouldn&apos;t the intervals total 498c, not 500c, if we&apos;re talking about<br/>Ptolemaic divisions which multiply out to a 4:3? (For Aristoxenian shades<br/>you could argue either way.)</p><p>in case you haven&apos;t seen it, here&apos;s an ascii version of the outline of the<br/>diagram, with apologies to John and the real thing:</p><p>          C 500<br/>           /\<br/>          /  \<br/>         /    \<br/>   a=0  /      \  b=0<br/>       /        \<br/>      /          \<br/>     /____________\<br/>  A 500   c=0     B 500</p><p>cheers --jon</p></div>
