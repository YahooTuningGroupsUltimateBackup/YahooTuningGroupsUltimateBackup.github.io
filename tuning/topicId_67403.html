Apart from<br/>one phrase which may make it seem that most current research in<br/>temperament and tuning is due to one individual (Owen Jorgensen), this<br/>is a reasonably well-balanced introduction to the reasons behind the<br/>piano&apos;s tuning history.  He also includes an interesting chart,<br/>graphically showing the &quot;widths&quot; (ie range in cents across all keys)<br/>of the Major thirds in several temperaments:<br/><a href="http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/3rds_chart.html">http://www.uk-piano.org/edfoote/3rds_chart.html</a></p><p>The page is copyright by Edward Foote 2001.  Perhaps he would consent<br/>to its inclusion on a microtonal wiki?  Alternatively, one of our list<br/>members may wish to write a similar introduction, independent of<br/>Foote&apos;s.  Either way, this could serve as a gentle way of leading many<br/>newcomers into the world of alternate tunings.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Yahya</p></div>
