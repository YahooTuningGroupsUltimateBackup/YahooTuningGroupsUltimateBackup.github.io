I&apos;m very<br/>&gt;&gt; interested in seeing responses to John Link&apos;s 9/7 &quot;solution.&quot; If that turns<br/>&gt;&gt; out to be valid, it raises the question as to WHY the &quot;high third&quot; would be<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;preferred&quot; over the 4:5:6 tuning of the major triad, which is clearly more<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;consonant&quot; by JI standards. Also, it raises considerable concern as to the<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;root&quot; occurring as partial 7. Perhaps roots are beside the point in this<br/>&gt;&gt; regard and are only important to writers of harmony books. Maybe we are<br/>&gt;&gt; looking in all the wrong places.</p><p>In order to understand the issue, you would have to dig up a number of posts<br/>over the past few weeks in which I and others have been looking for a<br/>mathematical basis for the observation that singers (and presumably string<br/>players) seem to &quot;prefer&quot; a third (when both root and fifth are sounding)<br/>that is considerably higher than 12j-tET. I will attempt to clarify in<br/>response to your questions.</p><p>&gt;Is the &quot;high third&quot; on a I chord, a V chord (etc...) and where is it<br/>&gt;going melodically?</p><p>Function is not at issue.</p><p>Despite your paragraph here, I think you have<br/>&gt;been looking in the right places, those being what is appropriate for<br/>&gt;the melody and harmony of the moment.</p><p>I agree that tuning is modified by context. What we are discussing has no<br/>context other than a major triad.</p><p>&gt;9/7, even for a leading tone, seems a bit more sharp than I would expect.<br/>&gt;I&apos;d be more inclined to think pythagorean, which is only 8 cents sharper<br/>&gt;from just than 12tet. Heres a few different leading tones, the first is<br/>&gt;based on 9/7, the second is pythagorean, for those who like primes and<br/>&gt;overtones then &quot;the 11/8 of the 11/8&quot; is almost deadon to 12tet, and<br/>&gt;the last two are a pair of &quot;next overtone&quot; from 15/8.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;ratio    27/14   243/128  121/64  61/32  31/16<br/>&gt;cents     1137    1110     1103    1117   1145<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;of course, 36/19 is also a nice leading tone at 1106 cents (and comes<br/>&gt;from the classic 38:48:57 triad...) Beats me, as Charlie Parker said,<br/>&gt;its &quot;still gone music.&quot;</p><p>Here&apos;s the crux of the problem. Singers seem to agree on a single specific<br/>tuning of the major third when root and fifth are sounding, apparently<br/>because it &quot;locks&quot; in tune. The questions are: what? and why?</p><p>Your five leading tones are probably very lovely, but we are looking for a<br/>very specific one.</p><p>Thanks for your interest.</p><p>G. Eskelin</p></div>
