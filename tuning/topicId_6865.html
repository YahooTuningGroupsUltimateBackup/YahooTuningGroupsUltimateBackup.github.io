(Actually, that also solves the<br/>&quot;performance practice&quot; quandry as well)</p><p>This is all very encouraging, since &quot;microtonal&quot; is already in such general<br/>use, and couldn&apos;t be changed anyway.

The &quot;enharmonic genus&quot; of ancient<br/> &gt; Greece did become an object of derision.<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; Timotheous was banished from Sparta for adding extra strings<br/> &gt; to the kithara</p><p> &gt; [Daniel Wolf, TD 439.2]<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; The strings added by Timotheus more probably extended the<br/> &gt; range of the instrument than interpolated additional tones<br/> &gt; to the scale (which presumably had a maximum of seven pitch<br/> &gt; classes within any successive octave).</p><p> An interesting discussion of this in Levin 1994 (p 160-163,<br/> in the Commentary on what I have found to be the extremely<br/> intriguing Chapter 11 of Nicomachus&apos;s _Encheiridion Harmonikes_)<br/> tends to support what Daniel Wolf says here.</p><p> But a contrary view is presented by none other than Boethius.</p><p> Boethius quoted the famous &apos;Spartan Decree&apos; which censured<br/> Timotheus, and this document does indeed provide evidence<br/> that Timotheus tampered with the tuning of the kithara (or<br/> lyre, depending on the translation), which indicates that<br/> he &apos;interpolated additional tones to the scale&apos;, or at<br/> least retuned them:</p><p> &gt; [Bower 1989, Appendix 2, p 188]<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; Whereas Timotheus, the Milesian, coming to our city,<br/> &gt; dishonours the ancient music, and, rejecting the melody<br/> &gt; of the 7-stringed lyre, corrupts the ears of our youth by<br/> &gt; introducing a variety of tones; and by the multiplicity of<br/> &gt; the strings, and the novelty of the melody, renders the<br/> &gt; music effeminate and complex instead of simple and uniform;<br/> &gt; composing his melody in the chromatic instead of the enharmonic<br/> &gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br/> &gt; [emphasis Monzo] ... be it therefore resolved, that the Kings<br/> &gt; and Ephori shall censure Timotheus for these things, and<br/> &gt; moreover shall oblige him to retrench the superfluous number<br/> &gt; of his 11 strings, leaving 7 ...</p><p> (This is the translation in Burgess 1821, which Bower,<br/> who presents a carefully reconstructed Greek text on p 4-5,<br/> says &apos;accurately captures the content and background&apos;.)</p><p> Boethius quotes this directly, in the Greek alphabet, rather<br/> than translating it (perhaps because it is in Spartan/Doric<br/> dialect), and in his Latin summary of it reiterates:</p><p> &gt; [Bower 1989, p 5]<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; Timotheus ... had changed the harmony, which he had found<br/> &gt; temperate, into the chromatic genus, which is overrefined.</p><p> Bower also supplies a footnote, correctly stating that the word<br/> _harmonia_, while it referred strictly to either the ancient<br/> scales or the idea of &apos;proper attunement&apos; in general, could<br/> also be referring here to the enharmonic genus, as seems<br/> appropriate to me in this particular context.</p><p> This document is also translated in Strunk 1950 (p 81-82),<br/> and Strunk provides a footnote where he says that it is:</p><p> &gt; [Strunk 1950, p 82n]<br/> &gt;<br/> &gt; perhaps the oldest forged document known to musical history.<br/> &gt; Wilamowitz, who suggests some emendations in the text ...<br/> &gt; places it in the 2nd century BC and calls it &apos;a potpourri<br/> &gt; of every convceivable dialectal anomaly&apos;.</p><p> Bower 1989, in his Appendix 2, discusses the problems with<br/> the transmission of this text, but certainly does not agree<br/> that it is a &apos;forgery&apos;; the main difficulty, other than the<br/> confusion of medieval Latin scribes over the Greek in general,<br/> is its unusual dialect.</p><p> Aristoxenus discusses the disappearance of the &apos;old enharmonic&apos;<br/> - that is, the one with the true 81/64 Pythagorean ditone<br/> (which he favored), as opposed to the &apos;modern&apos; 5/4 version<br/> described by Didymus - in a couple of places.</p><p> In the pseudo-Plutarch _de Musica_, quoting Aristoxenus<br/> (see Macran 1902, p 247), he says that there are two reasons<br/> for the gradual extinction of the enharmonic genus: the<br/> difficulty of hearing &apos;quarter-tones&apos;, and the impossibility<br/> of measuring them accurately by means of the method of &apos;Tuning<br/> by Concords&apos; (i.e., successive &apos;4ths&apos; and &apos;5ths&apos;), by which one<br/> *could* derive not only the Pythagorean diatonic but also the<br/> Pythagorean chromatic scales.</p><p> Of course, if this Method were carried out far enough, to a<br/> very extending Pythagorean tuning, one would finally arrive<br/> at something resembling &apos;quarter-tones&apos;, but one would find<br/> intervals resembling &apos;third-tones&apos; far sooner, and Aristoxenus<br/> used these for one of his shades of the chromatic genus.</p><p> The bottom line is that Timotheus was censured not for using<br/> quarter-tones (i.e., the enharmonic genus), but rather for<br/> &apos;twisting *that* out of shape&apos; and making it chromatic, which<br/> used semitones.  The enharmonic was the preferred genus in<br/> musically conservative Sparta.</p><p> (All this and much more will be in my upcoming paper on<br/> Aristoxenus, which at this point is more like a book than<br/> a paper.)</p><p> REFERENCES<br/> ----------</p><p> Burgess, Bishop T.  1821. _A Vindication of Bishop Cleaver&apos;s<br/>   Edition of the Decretum Lacedaemoniorum Contra Timotheum,<br/>   from the Strictures of R.

In some piece up (as you said) and in some down (as I<br/>had remembered).</p><p>Some scores even have Piano II as quartertone high!</p><p>Now about the enharmonic genus in ancient Greek times,  I suspect that the<br/>quartertones were fairly irrelevent to the impressions left by the mode on<br/>the listener.  Yes, there was likely a quality akin to what Boethius<br/>discusses (re distinguishing ancient Lydian and Phrygian modes).  But if the<br/>enharmonic had a 5/4 major third, then I suggest that this is the _main_<br/>interval and focus of the mode.  The quartertones which are always different<br/>in ratio, are used based on the direction of the line.  They are functioning<br/>as remainders for the important interval that is etched in the mind without<br/>question.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
