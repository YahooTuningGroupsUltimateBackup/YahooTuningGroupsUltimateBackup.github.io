I will<br/>investigate, and thank you for the precise citations, which will be quite<br/>interesting...  I was especially happy to see that items from the extensive<br/>library on Anaphoria are available on the Web...  I was hoping to voyage to<br/>Anaphoria some day, but noticed there were no direct flights :-( .<br/>Apparently, I would have to mainline it through the seaside connex -- a bit<br/>long for my gyroscopic psyche...</p><p>Thanks again...</p><p>___________ _______ _____ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
