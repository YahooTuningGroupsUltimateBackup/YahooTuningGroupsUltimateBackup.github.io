On 11/24/99, Ken Wauchope wrote,</p><p>&quot;I&apos;ve posted 1/4-comma and 1/5-comma meantone versions of JdL&apos;s Bach<br/>Chaconne in D- at</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://www.aic.nrl.navy.mil/~wauchope/audio/tuning/b-b-b-MT.zip">http://www.aic.nrl.navy.mil/~wauchope/audio/tuning/b-b-b-MT.zip</a></p><p>I settled on meantone in C (F and G were close seconds) based mostly<br/>on the chord progression from 2:09-2:20.</p><p>[By meantone in C, Ken meant a chain of meantone fifths from Eb to G#]</p><p>  Since meantone does contain<br/>several good 7-limit intervals, I hear quite a bit of lovely &quot;septimal<br/>buzz&quot; in these versions, which perhaps supports JdL&apos;s preference for a<br/>7-limit approach.</p><p>Like Wendy Carlos (and according to her, Bach also), I prefer the<br/>1/5-comma tuning where the thirds have a bit more forward momentum --<br/>in 1/4-comma they &quot;sit back on their haunches&quot;, which is great for<br/>Renaissance polyphony but not dynamic enough for the Baroque.&quot;</p><p>On 11/26/99, he wrote,</p><p>&quot;The challenge as I see it in tuning this kind of music has always been<br/>to reconcile melody and harmony, the horizontal and vertical.  Static<br/>JI has the purest harmonies, but even a simple melodic motive like<br/>1/1-9/8-5/4 can be unsatisfying because you start off on a bold<br/>204-cent step and then &quot;back off&quot; suddenly with a hesitant 182-cent step.<br/>1/4-C MT evens this out melodically by splitting the 5/4 in half --<br/>allowing consistent melodies in a consonant 5-limit harmonic context<br/>-- but melodies that have a &quot;laid-back&quot; quality since the emphasis is<br/>still on vertical sonority.</p><p>Since much of Bach does indeed &quot;work&quot; in MT in the sense that it is<br/>possible to pick a key of MT that will get through the entire piece<br/>without ever sounding perfectly awful (tuned in C MT the Chaconne has<br/>only one very brief wolf fifth at beat 69:1:254), 1/5-C MT is a<br/>nice compromise because the overall horizonal structure remains<br/>logically consistent while trading off vertical consonance just a bit<br/>for slightly more melodically aggressive seconds and thirds.  At the<br/>same time, there are noticeable changes in consonance as the piece<br/>modulates, just as in irregular circular temperaments -- including the<br/>occasional 5:6:7 or 4:5:6:7 harmony, such as the diminished chords<br/>from 2:09-2:39 and the Bb7 and Eb7 around 5:01-5:17, a happy side<br/>effect of the tuning that adds moments of spice and variety.</p><p>As I say, some of the pitch shifts in the tighter 5-limit adaptive JI<br/>versions are evocative, but others strike me as weird or disturbing, a<br/>disruption of the horizontal flow of the piece.  Maybe there&apos;s some<br/>relatively simple set of horizontal constraints that could control<br/>that and result in a choir-like naturalness in both dimensions.&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=7958 href="#7958">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2000 7:17:15 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; [Paul Erlich, TD 493.20]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; This piece was originally written for solo violin.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; Who did this arrangement?

This was an electric<br/>instrument that was a forerunner of the modern synthesizer,<br/>and was capable of producing any frequency (I don&apos;t know<br/>what its limits of accuracy were); as Busoni says, &apos;an<br/>infinite gradation of the octave&apos;.</p><p>Busoni was also the person responsible for introducing<br/>36-EDO to Alois Haba, who *did* compose pieces in that<br/>tuning starting in 1923.
