And it<br/>seems to me that functional harmony is the ability to make<br/>chord changes within a single &quot;key&quot;.</p><p>A functional progression is a series of chords, each with<br/>its own root pitch, that somehow also gives the impression<br/>of an unchanging global root pitch called the &quot;tonic&quot;.<br/>(I say much the same thing in this post from October:<br/><a href="/tuning/topicId_93833.html#93929">/tuning/topicId_93833.html#93929</a>  )</p><p>The term functional __harmony__ in fact implies a melody,<br/>which is harmonized with a functional chord progression.<br/>&quot;Tonal music&quot;, then, will be music with functional harmony.<br/>So it&apos;s</p><p>functional progression -&gt; functional harmony -&gt; tonal music</p><p>~ Part 2: Mechanism ~</p><p>Harmonic entropy tells us that some chords inherently sound<br/>more rooted than others.  But it&apos;s not clear that any chord<br/>is absolutely excluded from having a root.</p><p>But OK, we at least have some idea what a chord root is.<br/>The more mysterious thing is the global tonic.  What causes<br/>a chord progression to have one?  I don&apos;t know.</p><p>If I have a chord progression where the intersection of<br/>chords&apos; pitch classes contains only one element, that&apos;s an<br/>obvious candidate.  Any progression of three or more chords<br/>from a tonality diamond will have this property.  But the<br/>intersection of I-IV-V-I is empty.</p><p>A composer can use repetition to emphasize a pitch class.<br/>But the great Romantic sonatas are known for not doing<br/>this, and in fact for maintaining key centers despite<br/>protracted &quot;excursions&quot;, repeating notes other than the<br/>tonic, avoiding the tonic, etc.</p><p>Maybe it&apos;s more of a melodic thing.  If we know the scale<br/>being used, we can assign scale degrees to pitches we hear<br/>by recognizing melodic intervals.  There are two basic<br/>ways to recognize them: by absolute size or relative size.<br/>Absolute size is like, &quot;I know that&apos;s 700 cents&quot;.  If you<br/>can recognize by absolute size you can always find your<br/>place in any scale you know.  If you can only recognize by<br/>relative size, the scale must be Rothenberg-proper.</p><p>Let&apos;s assume that one way or the other you can map scale<br/>degrees to the pitches you&apos;re hearing.  But which pitch is<br/>degree #1?  This is the same as asking what mode the music<br/>is in, and the same as knowing which pitch is the tonic.</p><p>If society just arbitrarily picks a standard -- one mode<br/>that is the only possible tonic mode -- that would do it.<br/>Of course it&apos;s necessary that the modes of the scale be<br/>different!  6-ET won&apos;t work.  Here&apos;s a matrix showing its<br/>modes as rows, with intervals in relative sizes:</p><p>1 2 3 4 5 6<br/>1 2 3 4 5 6<br/>1 2 3 4 5 6<br/>1 2 3 4 5 6<br/>1 2 3 4 5 6<br/>1 2 3 4 5 6</p><p>This is also called the ROM (rank-order matrix) for 6-ET.<br/>Since every mode is the same, there&apos;s no way to find the<br/>one you agreed on!  So tonal music in this scale would be<br/>impossible if the &apos;melodic origin&apos; hypothesis is right.<br/>Here&apos;s the ROM for the diatonic scale in 12-ET:</p><p>2 4 5 7 9 11 12<br/>2 3 5 7 9 10 12<br/>1 3 5 7 8 10 12<br/>2 4 6 7 9 11 12<br/>2 4 5 7 9 10 12<br/>2 3 5 7 8 10 12<br/>1 3 5 6 8 10 12</p><p>Here every mode is different, so you&apos;re in business.<br/>Though Rothenberg pointed out they&apos;re still very similar.<br/>There are many pairs that different in only 1 or 2 spots.<br/>So it&apos;s possible for a given stretch of music to be<br/>tonally ambiguous.  For example, what mode is 1-3-8-3-10?<br/>Rothenberg thought this is what allowed Romantic sonatas<br/>to play those tricks.</p><p>Of course classical tonality had two modes in the flop --<br/>ionian and aeolian.  Composition was used to signal which<br/>mode was intended.  Starting chord was probably the big<br/>one.  If it started on a major chord, it was ionian.<br/>Minor chord, aeolian.  For whatever reason(s), a variety<br/>of scale substitutions were possible in minor pieces.<br/>The root of the starting chord was still to be the tonic.</p><p>Is any of this melodic stuff even necessary then?  Why not<br/>simply, &quot;The root of the first chord&quot;?</p><p>I have no idea.  And I&apos;m sure there are other possible<br/>explanations I haven&apos;t considered.  To the extent jazz is<br/>tonal, it seems any mode is acceptable, so perhaps there<br/>are compositional signals there.  Maybe Mike and other jazz<br/>experts can weigh in on how that works.  Is it just the<br/>starting chord?  Do chromatic notes in the extended chords<br/>provide signals?</p><p>Well this is pretty long, so I&apos;ll stop here.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=98726 href="#98726">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2011 3:18:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Apr 29, 2011 at 4:04 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I have a chord progression where the intersection of<br/>&gt; chords&apos; pitch classes contains only one element, that&apos;s an<br/>&gt; obvious candidate.

I<br/>certainly wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s not functional. Likewise, I wouldn&apos;t say<br/>that Cmaj -&gt; C#dim -&gt; D7 -&gt; G7b9 -&gt; Cmaj in meantone isn&apos;t functional.<br/>But I wouldn&apos;t say that it doesn&apos;t stick to the Ionian mode.</p><p>I think that it doesn&apos;t satisfy you because you&apos;re not just looking<br/>for functional harmony, which is based on the concept of there being<br/>such a thing as a &quot;resolution.&quot; The evolved version of a &quot;resolution&quot;<br/>is a sense of &quot;key,&quot; but furthermore, I don&apos;t think you&apos;re just<br/>looking for that either. I think you&apos;re looking for a harmonization of<br/>&quot;tonality&quot; and &quot;modality,&quot; which is what the diatonic scale does. The<br/>diatonic scale provides all kinds of resolutions and key centers, but<br/>also gives a sense of &quot;mode,&quot; e.g. gives the impression that certain<br/>chord qualities &quot;belong&quot; over certain roots, and that the chords that<br/>are set up this way are mainstays to the diatonic scale.</p><p>That means that when you&apos;re in major, you&apos;re predominantly using the<br/>IV chord, not the iv chord. And you&apos;re using the ii and iii chords,<br/>not the II and III chords. You might use those other chords sometimes,<br/>but they mainly serve as points of departure to spice up the blandness<br/>of vanilla diatonic harmony. If you use secondary dominants like V7/ii<br/>and V7/iii, they&apos;ll generally resolve to ii and iii, not II and III.<br/>So you get the sense of ii and iii being these old friends of the<br/>diatonic scale, and the whole thing becomes sensible in a way. This is<br/>why I say that Dorian has a certain sound, that Phrygian has a certain<br/>sound, and why I keep linking to all of these 90s rock groups as<br/>examples of these sounds - because if you&apos;re in Dorian, one of the<br/>mainstays is the IV7 chord, and if you&apos;re in Phrygian, one of the<br/>mainstays is the bII chord. This creates the &quot;sound&quot; of that mode.<br/>These sounds were never explored in common practice music, but they<br/>have been pretty deeply explored in the last century.</p><p>So my chord progressions with porcupine lacked the feeling of there<br/>being some novel, original, xenharmonic porcupine &quot;sound.&quot; They<br/>weren&apos;t an attempt to make one, just an attempt to modulate around the<br/>lattice and see if I could make the whole thing sound predictable, but<br/>avoid 81/80 pumps. Petr&apos;s examples, on the other hand, stick more<br/>closely to porcupine[8], but sometimes I wish there were V-I&apos;s in<br/>certain cases where he uses v-I&apos;s. He doesn&apos;t want to do that because<br/>he&apos;s trying to limit the size of the chain of generators as much as<br/>possible (which means that chromatically altering intervals is an<br/>unattractive option). A middle path here is to stick to porcupine[8]<br/>and alter things sometimes to increase the strength of the<br/>resolutions, which is what we historically did with the minor scale.<br/>We didn&apos;t &quot;learn to hear v-i as a strong resolution,&quot; we just changed<br/>it.</p><p>&gt; Here every mode is different, so you&apos;re in business.<br/>&gt; Though Rothenberg pointed out they&apos;re still very similar.<br/>&gt; There are many pairs that different in only 1 or 2 spots.<br/>&gt; So it&apos;s possible for a given stretch of music to be<br/>&gt; tonally ambiguous. For example, what mode is 1-3-8-3-10?<br/>&gt; Rothenberg thought this is what allowed Romantic sonatas<br/>&gt; to play those tricks.</p><p>What does 1-3-8-3-10 signify? Why does 3 appear twice?</p><p>&gt; Of course classical tonality had two modes in the flop --<br/>&gt; ionian and aeolian. Composition was used to signal which<br/>&gt; mode was intended. Starting chord was probably the big<br/>&gt; one. If it started on a major chord, it was ionian.<br/>&gt; Minor chord, aeolian. For whatever reason(s), a variety<br/>&gt; of scale substitutions were possible in minor pieces.<br/>&gt; The root of the starting chord was still to be the tonic.</p><p>I don&apos;t know why you always say aeolian here, when V-i completely<br/>dominates v-i in terms of the frequency of use in minor. I&apos;d say that<br/>harmonic minor is more common than aeolian. Or really, what I&apos;d say is<br/>that minor is a certain concept, and that the concept lends itself in<br/>meantone to three parallel minor scales, which we&apos;ve picked for the<br/>sake of keeping things Rothenberg proper and sized at 7 notes. If we<br/>were in dicot, those three would be tempered to one scale, so you<br/>wouldn&apos;t need parallel natural/melodic/harmonic minor scales.<br/>Likewise, in porcupine, if you&apos;re trying to play in something similar<br/>to common practice &quot;major,&quot; you&apos;d end up needing parallel<br/>natural/melodic/harmonic major scales, which I laid out in one of my<br/>previous posts. However, in meantone, or mavila, you only need one.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98728 href="#98728">ðŸ”—</a>Mike Battaglia &#x3C;battaglia01@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2011 3:36:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, Apr 29, 2011 at 4:04 PM, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have no idea.

If, say, you want to create a tonicized Dorian,<br/>just use chords that happen to be mainstays of Dorian instead of<br/>mainstays of Aeolian. This means that instead of going to the bVI, go<br/>to the IV or the IV7 chord. But the point is that doing so doesn&apos;t<br/>mean that you have to limit yourself to only the notes in Dorian -<br/>they certainly didn&apos;t with Aeolian. If you ever do want a strong<br/>resolution back to the I chord, feel free to temporarily raise the 7<br/>so you can play a proper V7 chord. Or you can cheat and use something<br/>like Gmaj6/A as a V chord which resolves to Dm9. The end result is you<br/>still get the feeling of being in D minor, but you come to understand<br/>that the Gmaj is a mainstay of the scale you&apos;re at, so that when you<br/>move to Gm (which would be Aeolian) it sounds like a modulation.</p><p>Maybe some history would be useful. There are a lot of different<br/>styles of extended 20th century harmony, but in terms of the<br/>Gershwin-&gt;Cole Porter-&gt;Standards-&gt;Bebop axis, which is where most of<br/>this started, chromatic signaling is a huge part of it. The basic unit<br/>of chromatic signaling in jazz is the &quot;2-5&quot; progression, which you&apos;d<br/>more formally notate as iim7-&gt;V7 (-&gt; Imaj7). So you play ii-V and it<br/>causes you to expect a I. If you want to imply minor, you&apos;d go iim7b5<br/>-&gt; V7b9 -&gt; i. So in that sense, you can still think of it as just<br/>using borrowed progressions from major and harmonic minor, which is<br/>how the whole thing started. This is kind of what I was trying to do<br/>with the porcupine examples, just use ii-V&apos;s all over the place so<br/>that I can follow it mentally, but have the whole thing end up<br/>differently than it would in meantone. Except instead of ii-V&apos;s, I<br/>just used secondary dominants to make it sound more common practice-y.<br/>There&apos;s also ivm7-&gt;bVII7-&gt;Imaj7, i.e. Fm7 -&gt; Bb9 -&gt; Cmaj7, which you<br/>could say is loosely based around ascending melodic major. This is<br/>also how Giant Steps works - ii-V-I&apos;s moving up in major thirds. Then<br/>they&apos;d just add higher-limit extensions over whatever they wanted, but<br/>since the basic root of it is still built on meantone comma pumps and<br/>ii-V-I&apos;s (or just V-I&apos;s), the whole thing still sounds like it makes<br/>sense, which is what I was trying to get at with my higher-limit<br/>porcupine example.</p><p>So effective is this trick that bebop musicians ran it completely into<br/>the ground. People started to get really tired of it, and expanded on<br/>the approach with the whole &quot;modal jazz&quot; thing. Bill Evans really<br/>helped to make this happen by influencing Miles&apos; playing on Kind of<br/>Blue, and Evans is known for his use of introducing impressionistic<br/>harmony. At first, they mainly used drones, which didn&apos;t do much in<br/>the way of functional harmony, but was a good way to get everyone to<br/>familiarize themselves with having different mainstay chords for the<br/>tonic they&apos;re in. Then they started to move around more<br/>(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrP7KI6--2c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrP7KI6--2c</a>), so that suddenly you<br/>start to hear things where instead of there being chord progressions,<br/>there are &quot;mode progressions,&quot; different mainstay modes and ones that<br/>are further out, which might be just another way of saying we started<br/>to get familiar with really extended harmony. They were already kind<br/>of doing this with bebop by reharmonizing every chord they played, but<br/>it really took off here. Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, etc, all did<br/>lots of great work here (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvRkGglLe-U">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvRkGglLe-U</a>).</p><p>This is when everything forks off, and I can&apos;t give you as clear a<br/>picture. Certain aspects of this movement jumped over into pop music,<br/>so that we started seeing more extended harmonies everywhere, where<br/>I&apos;d have to say that R&amp;B and neo-soul ended up dominating that<br/>concept. Progressive rock folks got down on it too, and it stopped<br/>being about &quot;jazz.&quot; Electronic musicians and hip hop artists, who<br/>generally have to repeat the same musical fragment for 5 minutes in a<br/>row, had to make sure their loops were as interesting as possible, so<br/>they&apos;d use modes all the time. Metal groups would use Phrygian and<br/>Locrian a lot. Meanwhile, in jazz, the whole thing kept continuing,<br/>reaching a peak with albums like In a Silent Way, where things resolve<br/>for reasons that I can&apos;t explain, and I think they stumbled on<br/>something completely different. Then things got kind of crappy during<br/>the fusion era (still plenty of modal writing though), and we&apos;re now<br/>seeing a resurgence of lots of interesting ideas.</p><p>So that should give you some context in how to look at this stuff.<br/>There are lots, and lots, and lots of harmonic concepts to be derived<br/>from the modal exploration. What you&apos;re looking for is someone who<br/>modulates out for a while and then comes back in an emphatically<br/>&quot;Dorian&quot; sound, and you&apos;re not going to find that, because while jazz<br/>and pop musicians were doing all of this, the classical world was<br/>stuck in a perpetual serialist loop. Steve Reich brought a lot of the<br/>sound back, although not in a way that resolves. At one point I wanted<br/>to write a series of fugues in every mode, but never did, since I<br/>decided microtonal music was more interesting. So for now, you&apos;re<br/>going to be limited to proof chord progressions that repeat every two<br/>bars when you try to find examples of much of it. But it does prove<br/>that harmony is bigger than major and minor.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98732 href="#98732">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2011 4:16:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- Mike Battaglia &lt;battaglia01@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; If I have a chord progression where the intersection of<br/>&gt; &gt; chords&apos; pitch classes contains only one element, that&apos;s an<br/>&gt; &gt; obvious candidate.

Take the triads 4:5:6, 6:7:9, 10:12:15, and 14:18:21, where the lowest note of each chord is the same pitch (say an &quot;A&quot; of 440 Hz).  They all are said to &quot;point&quot; to a different 1/1, but in actual practice, they all sound like &quot;A&quot; chords.  I mean, if you play E-G-B in a superpyth temperament, you&apos;re not going to &quot;hear it&quot; as &quot;A9(no root, no 3)&quot; or whatever.</p><p>&gt; But OK, we at least have some idea what a chord root is.<br/>&gt; The more mysterious thing is the global tonic.  What causes<br/>&gt; a chord progression to have one?  I don&apos;t know.</p><p>I think you&apos;re making a mistake in thinking that there is a &quot;global tonic&quot; that is constantly in the background of every chord functional progression.  The fact that modulations are possible at all suggests to me that you can depart from any point in an unresolved chord progression and find a path that will let you resolve to any consonant triad.  Some chords may require a more circuitous route than others to make you feel them as a tonic, but the point is that until the chord progression is &quot;finished&quot;, the tonic is undefined.  I mean, you can go hog-wild with all sorts of borrowed chords and secondary dominants and what-have-you, but as long as you come back to a strong resolution like a V-I or V7-I or V-i or something, whatever chord that resolution drops you onto is more likely than not going to feel like a &quot;tonic&quot;.  Tritone subs are good too, like F7-Emaj...heck, it might all come down to the leading-tone, for all I know.  That would explain why V-i is stronger than v-i.</p><p>I feel this all the time in Blackwood[10].  According to Rothenbergian ideas, there shouldn&apos;t be a tonal center, but really, there are at least 5 &quot;potential&quot; tonal centers (maybe 10, haven&apos;t done much work with minor resolutions yet).  Why?  Because every major triad can extend to both a major 7th AND a dominant 7th, and also has another major triad a fifth above it and a fifth below it.  So you can do a V7-I resolution to any major triad, and guess what?  It works every time, especially with appropriate tension-building set-up.  Moreover, it doesn&apos;t matter at all what chord you start the piece on, since there are natural progressions in Blackwood[10] that almost feel like modulations.</p><p>On the other hand, 7-EDO doesn&apos;t feel atonal to me, either, and I concur with Mike that I hear some crazy auditory illusions when playing &quot;normal&quot; progressions like I-vi-ii-V-I in 7-EDO, such that I hear majors and minors where there are only neutrals, and still get a sense of the I being the tonic, despite the lack of a leading-tone.</p><p>I hate to say this, but I think even 6-EDO can be tonal and functional.

That&apos;s my best guess at what makes Mike&apos;s porcupine example work, what makes jazz work, what makes my own microtonal music work.

I don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you&apos;re making a mistake in thinking that there is a &quot;global tonic&quot; that is constantly in the background of every chord functional progression.</p><p>I agree, I think it&apos;s more like if you ever do come back to the tonic,<br/>it just sounds familiar. You don&apos;t need your childhood home to be in<br/>the background of your life constantly to feel refreshed when you go<br/>back to it. Familiarity is the concept. The entire concept is based<br/>around a clever manipulation of long-term memory to somehow create<br/>pleasure.</p><p>&gt; The fact that modulations are possible at all suggests to me that you can depart from any point in an unresolved chord progression and find a path that will let you resolve to any consonant triad. Some chords may require a more circuitous route than others to make you feel them as a tonic, but the point is that until the chord progression is &quot;finished&quot;, the tonic is undefined.</p><p>Agreed, although many people have played around with the shared<br/>expectations of their audience to imply a tonic based on what folks<br/>have learned. Such movements tend to be transient and get superceded<br/>by periods of harmonic expansion. I also think this is why folks seem<br/>to differ in their perception of ||: Gm7 -&gt; C7 :||, which to me sounds<br/>like a stereotypical Carlos Santana progression in G dorian, but to<br/>many seems to imply Fmaj is coming up.</p><p>&gt; I mean, you can go hog-wild with all sorts of borrowed chords and secondary dominants and what-have-you, but as long as you come back to a strong resolution like a V-I or V7-I or V-i or something, whatever chord that resolution drops you onto is more likely than not going to feel like a &quot;tonic&quot;. Tritone subs are good too, like F7-Emaj...heck, it might all come down to the leading-tone, for all I know. That would explain why V-i is stronger than v-i.</p><p>I thought it was the leading tone as well, but see my last post about<br/>using sines and awkward voice leading - still sounds stronger.</p><p>&gt; On the other hand, 7-EDO doesn&apos;t feel atonal to me, either, and I concur with Mike that I hear some crazy auditory illusions when playing &quot;normal&quot; progressions like I-vi-ii-V-I in 7-EDO, such that I hear majors and minors where there are only neutrals, and still get a sense of the I being the tonic, despite the lack of a leading-tone.</p><p>I think Knowsur gave a good clue as to how this works:</p><p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/knowsur/haneru">http://soundcloud.com/knowsur/haneru</a></p><p>Do you hear this as predominantly being &quot;minor?&quot; I&apos;m not talking about<br/>dorian vs aeolian vs etc, I&apos;m asking if the tonic triad to you sounds<br/>like it&apos;s major or minor. I hear it as being minor.</p><p>In 7-tet notation, the melody that comes in on the bell-like<br/>instrument is B E D G C, G F C B, E, G</p><p>Note that B-E-G is a dicot-tempered 3:4:5, which when you put it over<br/>C becomes a Cm7 chord, and that&apos;s exactly how I hear it. Furthermore,<br/>he keeps playing this figure, constantly reinforcing this perception.<br/>So the big picture to me is that</p><p>1) B-E-G clues you into 3:4:5<br/>2) Harmonic Entropy leaves the scene and learned factors come into it<br/>3) HE sends the &quot;3:4:5&quot; cue on down the line, and we have some kind of<br/>learned system of logic to figure out what 3:4:5 means in this<br/>context, with the bass note going on, etc.<br/>4) Whatever those cues are somehow end up cluing us into hearing it as minor<br/>5) We can argue about what percentage of the cues are psychoacoustic,<br/>and what percentage are based in learning, but that&apos;s beside the point</p><p>&gt; Thus, my hypothesis about &quot;tonality&quot; and &quot;functionality&quot; is that they are not inherent properties of scales (although there may be scales that are inherently atonal), but are sensations created by specific types of chordal or melodic motion.

But even if I&apos;m right about this, there&apos;s still a lot of unanswered questions.</p><p>A lot of it has to do with comma pumps, which enable you to leave the<br/>tonic in one direction and come back to it from another. All of<br/>western music makes use of this. For example:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZWSZyFzZkI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZWSZyFzZkI</a></p><p>Merry Christmas. The chords are</p><p>Emaj -&gt; Amaj -&gt; F#maj -&gt; Bmaj -&gt; G#maj -&gt; C#m -&gt; Amaj Bmaj -&gt; Emaj</p><p>OK, so the first thing that happens is that this chord progression<br/>takes us straight into hyperspace, building a huge sense of tension as<br/>you eventually get to that C#m. Then, finally, it goes C#m -&gt; Amaj<br/>Bmaj -&gt; Emaj, resolving the tension and bringing us back home! Yes!</p><p>Sounds good, doesn&apos;t it? Well guess what? It only works because 81/80<br/>vanishes. The whole thing makes no sense in JI, and you end up 81/80<br/>down from the root. So the entire building of tension -&gt; climax -&gt;<br/>coming back to the tonic via a different route only works because of<br/>the comma pump. In fact, the entire concept IS a comma pump. How the<br/>hell are you going to ever come back to the tonic via a different<br/>route than you departed if we&apos;re in JI, where nothing is tempered<br/>together?</p><p>If what people want from tonality is a sense of departure and return,<br/>or expectation and fulfillment, they really want comma pumps. This is<br/>what Petr seems to have figured out, but I don&apos;t know why it&apos;s not<br/>being screamed on here like a basic tenet of regular mapping theory.<br/>It pretty much explains all of common practice music. Thus ends my<br/>report.</p><p>OK, one last footnote before my report really ends: what about father,<br/>where the generators themselves are tempered together? I don&apos;t know.<br/>As we&apos;ve seen, there are these cognitive cues that clue you into<br/>hearing tempered intervals one way vs the other. I&apos;d say that the<br/>concept of starting with a protoharmonic JI lattice, which you then<br/>temper to create comma pumps, all takes place after these cues have<br/>kicked in. So if you&apos;re playing a just 16/11, but for some reason you<br/>were cued into hearing it as a 3/2, then as far as you&apos;re concerned,<br/>it IS a tempered 3/2, and you should treat it that way accordingly on<br/>the lattice. So in father, if you&apos;re treating it as a 5-limit<br/>temperament, I&apos;d still say there are 3 axes - 5/4, 3/2, and 2/1 - but<br/>that it takes some trickery to get you to actually hear things as<br/>moving vs the 5/4 axis vs the 4/3 axis. What this trickery is, I don&apos;t<br/>know. I assign the job of figuring that out to you.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98744 href="#98744">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/29/2011 5:31:31 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igs wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think you&apos;re making a mistake in thinking that there is a<br/>&gt; &quot;global tonic&quot; that is constantly in the background of every<br/>&gt; chord functional progression.</p><p>Er, I didn&apos;t say there had to be one for each piece, or anything<br/>of the kind.</p><p>&gt; Thus, my hypothesis about &quot;tonality&quot; and &quot;functionality&quot; is<br/>&gt; that they are not inherent properties of scales (although<br/>&gt; there may be scales that are inherently atonal), but are<br/>&gt; sensations created by specific types of chordal or melodic<br/>&gt; motion.

But in any case you very definitely *can* make tonal music with just a V-I, or even better a V-i.  One of my old friends in Santa Cruz, a gifted pianist (among his many other talents), could do more with those two chords than a lot of musicians can do with twelve.  I didn&apos;t even realize so many of his songs were just two chords over and over again until I tried to figure them out on guitar.  Granted, it was his melodies that made it work, but in any case V-I over and over on its own may get boring, but it&apos;s tonal.  Or, hey...&quot;Take a Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, it&apos;s just IV-I over and over again.</p><p>Why the idea of tonality seems so confusing is maybe because it&apos;s possible to go so far out over the course of a progression and yet still have a single tonic chord feel like &quot;home&quot;, and you&apos;re trying to look at all those &quot;middle&quot; chords for some kind of pattern (or patterns) that explains why the tonic can still feel like &quot;home&quot; at the end of the progression.  But I don&apos;t think those middle chords have anything at all to do with creating or maintaing the sense of tonic, except insofar as they build tension and prepare you for the resolution.  The resolution is the only part of the progression that really &quot;cements&quot; the feeling of the tonal center, so if we can come to understand how and why different resolutions work, that should be enough.

The listener<br/>expects it to resolve a certain way.

Most people<br/>agree in a very clear way that agrees with music theory.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s possible to surprise the listener by resolving in a<br/>different way to what they expect, but to do that you&apos;re playing with<br/>a very real expectation.

In a modulation,<br/>you have to make the key ambiguous, and then clarify it in a different<br/>way to how you started.</p><p>I remember a good example from rec.music.theory.  Unfortunately, I<br/>don&apos;t remember the details, like the name of the song.  But, it&apos;s a<br/>famous song, by a mainstream band, and the tonic is never stated in<br/>the chorus (I think) until the resolution.  Still, it&apos;s clear what the<br/>key is.

If, say, you want to create a tonicized<br/>&gt; Dorian, just use chords that happen to be mainstays of Dorian<br/>&gt; instead of mainstays of Aeolian.

But the<br/>&gt; point is that doing so doesn&apos;t mean that you have to limit<br/>&gt; yourself to only the notes in Dorian - they certainly didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; with Aeolian. If you ever do want a strong resolution back to<br/>&gt; the I chord, feel free to temporarily raise the 7 so you can<br/>&gt; play a proper V7 chord.</p><p>OK thanks.  It seems like you&apos;re agreeing here than the<br/>&apos;chords of the mode&apos; are important.  I have no problems with<br/>substitutions.  If the basic skeleton is coming from the mode,<br/>something like the &apos;melodic origin hypothesis&apos; might be<br/>at work.</p><p>&gt; Or you can cheat and use something<br/>&gt; like Gmaj6/A as a V chord which resolves to Dm9. The end result<br/>&gt; is you still get the feeling of being in D minor, but you come<br/>&gt; to understand that the Gmaj is a mainstay of the scale you&apos;re<br/>&gt; at, so that when you move to Gm (which would be Aeolian) it<br/>&gt; sounds like a modulation.</p><p>Hey, have I been misunderstanding you all along?  It seems<br/>you&apos;re saying Gmin signals D aeolian because Bb isn&apos;t<br/>in D dorian.</p><p>&gt; in terms of the Gershwin-&gt;Cole Porter-&gt;Standards-&gt;Bebop axis,<br/>&gt; chromatic signaling is a huge part of it. The basic unit of<br/>&gt; chromatic signaling in jazz is the &quot;2-5&quot; progression, which<br/>&gt; you&apos;d more formally notate as iim7-&gt;V7 (-&gt; Imaj7). So you<br/>&gt; play ii-V and it causes you to expect a I. If you want to<br/>&gt; imply minor, you&apos;d go iim7b5 -&gt; V7b9 -&gt; i.<br/>&gt; So in that sense, you can still think of it as just using<br/>&gt; borrowed progressions from major and harmonic minor,<br/>&gt; which is how the whole thing started.</p><p>Thanks!

This is also how Giant Steps works - ii-V-I&apos;s moving<br/>&gt; up in major thirds. Then they&apos;d just add higher-limit<br/>&gt; extensions over whatever they wanted, but since the basic<br/>&gt; root of it is still built on meantone comma pumps and ii-V-I&apos;s<br/>&gt; (or just V-I&apos;s), the whole thing still sounds like it makes<br/>&gt; sense, which is what I was trying to get at with my<br/>&gt; higher-limit porcupine example.</p><p>The &apos;extensions&apos; version is by far my favorite.  I&apos;m not<br/>sure what to make of that.  I guess I&apos;ve always said I expect<br/>higher-limit extensions of diatonic harmony to be a hugely<br/>fertile direction.  Jules Siegel is the example I&apos;ve always<br/>thought of (if you remember &quot;Calliope&quot;).  And George Secor.</p><p>&gt; People started to get really tired of it, and expanded on<br/>&gt; the approach with the whole &quot;modal jazz&quot; thing. Bill Evans<br/>&gt; really helped to make this happen by influencing Miles&apos;<br/>&gt; playing on Kind of Blue, and Evans is known for his use of<br/>&gt; introducing impressionistic harmony. At first, they mainly<br/>&gt; used drones, which didn&apos;t do much in the way of functional<br/>&gt; harmony, but was a good way to get everyone to familiarize<br/>&gt; themselves with having different mainstay chords for the<br/>&gt; tonic they&apos;re in.</p><p>Hm!

If, say, you want to create a tonicized<br/>&gt; &gt; Dorian, just use chords that happen to be mainstays of Dorian<br/>&gt; &gt; instead of mainstays of Aeolian. This means that instead of<br/>&gt; &gt; going to the bVI, go to the IV or the IV7 chord. But the<br/>&gt; &gt; point is that doing so doesn&apos;t mean that you have to limit<br/>&gt; &gt; yourself to only the notes in Dorian - they certainly didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; with Aeolian. If you ever do want a strong resolution back to<br/>&gt; &gt; the I chord, feel free to temporarily raise the 7 so you can<br/>&gt; &gt; play a proper V7 chord.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OK thanks. It seems like you&apos;re agreeing here than the<br/>&gt; &apos;chords of the mode&apos; are important. I have no problems with<br/>&gt; substitutions. If the basic skeleton is coming from the mode,<br/>&gt; something like the &apos;melodic origin hypothesis&apos; might be<br/>&gt; at work.</p><p>&quot;Important&quot; how? They&apos;re important for imparting a strong sense of<br/>&quot;modality&quot; to what&apos;s going on, but I don&apos;t think they&apos;re important to<br/>functional harmony. I think that Cmaj -&gt; A7b13 -&gt; D7#11 -&gt; G13b9 -&gt;<br/>Cmaj is very functional indeed, although you&apos;d play a different scale<br/>over every one of those chords (C ionian -&gt; A altered -&gt; D lydian<br/>dominant -&gt; G diminished[8] -&gt; Cmaj).</p><p>&gt; &gt; Or you can cheat and use something<br/>&gt; &gt; like Gmaj6/A as a V chord which resolves to Dm9. The end result<br/>&gt; &gt; is you still get the feeling of being in D minor, but you come<br/>&gt; &gt; to understand that the Gmaj is a mainstay of the scale you&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; at, so that when you move to Gm (which would be Aeolian) it<br/>&gt; &gt; sounds like a modulation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey, have I been misunderstanding you all along? It seems<br/>&gt; you&apos;re saying Gmin signals D aeolian because Bb isn&apos;t<br/>&gt; in D dorian.</p><p>That&apos;s what I&apos;m saying, yes. And if you&apos;re in D Aeolian, and you start<br/>playing B, it signals Dorian. What did you think I was saying?</p><p>&gt; &gt; So you play ii-V and it causes you to expect a I. If you want to<br/>&gt; &gt; imply minor, you&apos;d go iim7b5 -&gt; V7b9 -&gt; i.<br/>&gt; &gt; So in that sense, you can still think of it as just using<br/>&gt; &gt; borrowed progressions from major and harmonic minor,<br/>&gt; &gt; which is how the whole thing started.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It still seems here like this is consistent with the kind of<br/>&gt; thing I&apos;ve been chatting about.</p><p>It is. Although I should mention that ii-V&apos;s don&apos;t always have to<br/>imply I, but they certainly imply a mode of some sort. I think it has<br/>more to do with Rothenberg minimal sets than anything. As an example</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jrnihGqumE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jrnihGqumE</a></p><p>The form to this is AABA, it&apos;s rhythm changes. It&apos;s in Bb. The B<br/>section chord are Bm7 | E7 | Bbm7 | Eb7 | Am7 D7 | Abm7 Db7 | Gm7 C7 |<br/>F#m7 B7 (-&gt; Bbmaj). So you have a bunch of ii-V&apos;s that go down<br/>chromatically, and then the last one resolves via tritone sub to<br/>Bbmaj.</p><p>&gt; The &apos;extensions&apos; version is by far my favorite. I&apos;m not<br/>&gt; sure what to make of that. I guess I&apos;ve always said I expect<br/>&gt; higher-limit extensions of diatonic harmony to be a hugely<br/>&gt; fertile direction. Jules Siegel is the example I&apos;ve always<br/>&gt; thought of (if you remember &quot;Calliope&quot;). And George Secor.</p><p>Right, but in the extensions version, I&apos;m placing the higher-limit<br/>extensions on a porcupine shell, not a diatonic shell. So instead of<br/>leaving the tonic and returning by way of ii-V-I, which usually means<br/>you&apos;re making use of an 81/80 pun in there somewhere, I have the whole<br/>thing leaving the tonic by 10/9 and returning by IV -&gt; V -&gt; I, with a<br/>diminished chord and a I6/4 thrown in there somewhere. You can follow<br/>it mentally because the chord progression atoms are all things like<br/>Cmaj -&gt; Amaj -&gt; Dmaj -&gt; Bmaj -&gt; Emaj -&gt; C#maj -&gt; F#maj, except you end<br/>up at F instead of F#. The atomic chord progressions are all familiar,<br/>even though how they line up lands you at an unfamiliar place. You can<br/>even follow it if I place higher-limit stuff everywhere, because after<br/>the 8 sets of examples preceding, you should have enough of a<br/>porcupine template built up to follow the whole thing - kind of like<br/>what happens when you play Cmaj -&gt; A7b9 -&gt; D7#11 -&gt; G13b9 -&gt; C9#11 in<br/>meantone. You understand the 81/80-pun logic enough to follow the<br/>progression no matter what chord qualities you put over the roots.</p><p>&gt; Hm! Bebop is my favorite jazz.

The chords he uses are almost entirely from<br/>Dorian. I think he was clearly thinking of the piece that way, which<br/>is evident in the way he handles certain small details.</p><p>For example, sometimes he throws the V7 in there, so he has to move<br/>out of Dorian for a bit. But the the ii chord he decides to precede it<br/>with is iim7, as opposed to iim7b5 - he really wants to keep that B<br/>involved. When people are writing in Aeolian, and they want to throw<br/>the V chord in, they move from Aeolian to harmonic minor - i.e. they<br/>keep the b6 involved. He instead decides to move from Dorian -&gt;<br/>melodic minor, because he wants to keep the nat6 involved. The result<br/>is to my ears a very clear functionalization of Dorian mode.</p><p>At the end of the third phrase, you finally a Bb in the form of C7 -&gt;<br/>Bb, which should sound like a modulation of some kind (to Aeolian).<br/>For the fourth and final phrase, he stays in Aeolian, going to the bVI<br/>chord, and then finally ending with the Picardy third on Dmaj. My top<br/>secret, patent pending mode-finding-algorithm suggests D E F# G A Bb<br/>(C/C#) D as the mode for that Dmaj, with the C/C# in parentheses<br/>because I didn&apos;t hear a clear signal and my ears are telling me to<br/>avoid playing type of C at all - just make it hexatonic. Octatonic<br/>might work too - D E F# G A Bb C C# D, if propriety&apos;s your thing.</p><p>It&apos;s a great concept, and I wish I had more examples of it. The<br/>Shostakovich fugue you linked me to is pretty awesome, although I&apos;m<br/>not hearing much in the way of exotic modal harmony in it. I do hear<br/>some unexpected movements and resolutions though, although it sounds<br/>to me like it&apos;s always in ionian or aeolian/harmonic minor, but<br/>modulating to unexpected keys.

Do you think it&apos;s possible to finish on a wrong chord if the last three chords are major chords following root movements of 4/3-3/2-1/1?</p><p>&gt; &gt; You can&apos;t definitively give the key of a chord progression<br/>&gt; &gt; until its finished,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It certainly flies in the face of what they taught me in<br/>&gt; school.

The point I was trying to make is if you start at the beginning and you don&apos;t know where it ends, you don&apos;t know if a modulation is coming or not.  There are a million different ways a progression can go from any point that&apos;s not part of a resolution.  If you&apos;re three chords into a progression, let&apos;s say you&apos;ve had Cmaj, Fmaj, Dmin.  You might think, &quot;okay, it could go Gmaj, Cmaj, and then end, making C the tonic.&quot;  But does it have to do that?  No, there are plenty of functional ways it could get into another key.  And what if these aren&apos;t the first three chords, but somewhere in the middle of a progression?  What if the first chord is a Bb major or something?</p><p>The point is for the idea of a &quot;global tonic&quot; of a progression to exist, it&apos;d have to be obvious at every point (or else it wouldn&apos;t be &quot;global&quot;).  Therefore, you should be able to take any slice of the progression and be able to discern the tonic from it, which is obviously impossible.  The only way to determine a global tonic is to analyze a chord progression &quot;after the fact&quot; or on paper (although most composers of classical functional music give you the key in the notation).</p><p>&gt; I can make it without those too.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry if I&apos;ve given the impression that I think V-I is the only thing that will do.  Of course there are other types of resolutions!  But I think it is of obvious importance that while you *can* make tonal music with just a V-I over and over again, you can&apos;t do it with just any ol&apos; pair of chords over and over again.  I think if we want to figure out anything about how tonality works, we should start with the minimal conditions and build out from there.  Also examples of what *doesn&apos;t* work might actually be more helpful than examples of what does.</p><p>-Igs</p></div><h3><a id=98778 href="#98778">ðŸ”—</a>cityoftheasleep &#x3C;igliashon@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2011 9:22:24 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Graham Breed &lt;gbreed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I think Carl&apos;s right, in that there&apos;s a sense of sense of key center.<br/>&gt; The tonic isn&apos;t indeterminate until the resolution.

That&apos;s basically what I did there.</p><p>I&apos;d say that common dyads are definitely important. If you play it<br/>right, you can make it so that your melody is in C maj, where all of<br/>the chords you play under it aren&apos;t, which is a neat and pretty common<br/>effect. But I&apos;d also say that the Ebm7 in Cmaj7 -&gt; Ebm7 -&gt; Dm7 -&gt;<br/>G13b9 -&gt; is pretty functional. I&apos;d also say that out of all of the<br/>scales that you could play over Ebm7, Dorian will probably sound the<br/>most natural, as it retains most of the common tones of the previous<br/>chord (Cmaj7). In fact, sharping the 7 so that you have a min/maj7<br/>chord would make it sound even more natural. And if you also flat the<br/>5 so that you end up with a diminished maj7 chord, that&apos;d sound even<br/>more natural, and you&apos;d end up playing diminished[8] over that one.</p><p>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s what I&apos;m saying, yes. And if you&apos;re in D Aeolian, and<br/>&gt; &gt; you start playing B, it signals Dorian. What did you think<br/>&gt; &gt; I was saying?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The above is consistent with the Rothenberg-type explanation<br/>&gt; I posted. I guess I assumed you were arguing against that...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think it has more to do with Rothenberg minimal sets than<br/>&gt; &gt; anything.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...guess not!</p><p>I think that Rothenberg does a better job of explaining modality than<br/>tonality. If you can keep 7 notes in your mind simultaneously, then<br/>it&apos;s easy to see how they relate to one another. The simultaneous<br/>awareness of how all of these notes form chords, and how all of these<br/>notes and chords relate to the tonic, is what the &quot;mode&quot; of the<br/>current chord you&apos;re in is. This is what I was referring to earlier<br/>when I spoke about different chords being mainstays of different<br/>modes.=</p><p>The gist of it is - when you move to a new chord, find the mode that<br/>fits all of the notes of this new chord while changing as few notes as<br/>possible from the old one. That&apos;s about it. And, I note a &quot;natural&quot;<br/>behavior that&apos;s emerged out of extended harmony is - should you ever<br/>find yourself at something like C D# E F# G A Bb C, which is improper,<br/>99 times out of 100 people will stick the Db in there and turn it into<br/>diminished[8]. So propriety certainly has something to do with it.</p><p>So if you&apos;re playing a novel chord that requires a modulation, you<br/>will naturally end up gravitating to the one that has as many common<br/>tones as the last one - unless you deliberately want to modulate more<br/>than that. Lastly, if the resulting scale is improper, you&apos;ll probably<br/>find a proper closure for it, and probably the least dissonant note<br/>will sound the most natural. Then you&apos;ll continue to emphasize those<br/>notes in your mind by playing them as the melody. However, there&apos;s<br/>certainly nothing stopping you from leaving that mode, and doing so<br/>clearly doesn&apos;t destroy the functionality of the harmony. And learning<br/>to think in something like Pajara[10] generally just ends up with<br/>there being more &quot;avoid notes&quot; within the scale, so the result doesn&apos;t<br/>sound all that different. Whether or not you have a learned melodic<br/>imprint that has lots of avoid notes, or a learned melodic imprint<br/>that doesn&apos;t but treats the other notes as &quot;chromatic,&quot; doesn&apos;t seem<br/>to affect the actual sound much.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Anyway, Debussy is the o.g. who made it all start<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZHL1E4ILHo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZHL1E4ILHo</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My jazz teacher said the same thing.

Not a lot of use of parallel harmony<br/>either.</p><p>The point that I&apos;m making when I say it&apos;s &quot;functional&quot; is that<br/>although Dm7 -&gt; Amaj7 doesn&apos;t actually fit into any proper 7-note<br/>scale, it still causes a certain musical effect, and over time you can<br/>learn to predict what this effect will be in advance and use it in<br/>part of a larger progression to make &quot;functional&quot; music - music that<br/>enables people to predict in some sense what will happen next, or<br/>comprehend what did just happen.</p><p>You can learn to figure out in advance what Cm7 -&gt; Gbmaj7 will do -<br/>it&apos;ll cause a huge color shift and it&apos;s also a borrowed chord from C<br/>locrian, so the color shift will tend to lead to a very &quot;dark&quot; mood.<br/>Then you know that Gbmaj7 can resolve to Fm7, so you can create Cm7 -&gt;<br/>Gbmaj7 -&gt; Fm7. And then you might decide to get back to Cm7 by the<br/>same resolution, so you&apos;ll go Cm7 -&gt; Gbmaj7 -&gt; Fm7 -&gt; Dbmaj7. You&apos;ll<br/>figure out that Fm7 -&gt; Dbmaj7 will cause less of a color shift than<br/>Cm7 -&gt; Gbmaj7 because of all the common tones. The fact that you&apos;ve<br/>now become familiar with this means you&apos;re doing something very<br/>similar to what common practice composers were doing with I, IV, V,<br/>and diminished chords, and ii, and iii, and so on, except with new<br/>chords and resolutions. So it&apos;s very functional indeed. Instead of<br/>using the subdominant IV chord or perhaps the vi chord as a point of<br/>repose, there are now tons of new points of repose all over the place,<br/>many of which involve modulating from mode to mode.</p><p>Over time you start to get the picture that the modes themselves have<br/>nothing to do with it, but that meantone tempered 5-limit harmony has<br/>something to do with it, and the modes simply facilitate an analysis<br/>of what&apos;s going on. There are plenty of chords that don&apos;t even fit<br/>into a mode that I know of, although most of this turns out to be more<br/>experimental and less developed territory.

That&apos;s basically what I did there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn&apos;t say it wasn&apos;t functional! I said I don&apos;t how to tell<br/>&gt; if a piece of xenharmonic music is functional. As you can see<br/>&gt; from the present thread, I&apos;m still working on telling in 12-ET.</p><p>The whole concept of functional vs modal is a bit shaky. I don&apos;t think<br/>you can really draw a clear line between the two. How can you? The<br/>further we delve into modal harmony, the more we just end up<br/>discovering novel and exotic forms of &quot;functional&quot; harmony, to the<br/>point where the two overlap and you can&apos;t tell the difference. You can<br/>use all kinds of modal substitutions and still not destroy the sense<br/>of key that you&apos;re in. Furthermore, you can create the sense of a song<br/>being in the key of say D, while still having it be predominantly in,<br/>say Dorian, which has its own sound and is different sounding from<br/>Aeolian. The Sibelius piece I linked you to reflects in my view what<br/>would have happened if we had started writing music with Dorian<br/>instead of Aeolian mode - we&apos;d just have two minor scales, and they&apos;d<br/>be Dorian and melodic minor. The tonal heirarchy of the piece is<br/>definitely still centered around D. So I think the whole concept is<br/>antiquated and outdated.</p><p>But, for the purpose of this example, I went with the notion that<br/>functional means there exist things like chords &quot;resolving.&quot; So,<br/>rather than to prove a point about that you can still create and<br/>discover new and exotic resolutions by working within other modal<br/>systems, I decided that I&apos;d just stick with IV, and V, and I, and some<br/>diminished chords and stuff, just to create clear expectations and<br/>resolve them. I avoided 81/80 like the plague, and when possible<br/>treated it like 25/24 (which it is in porcupine). Lastly, I wanted the<br/>whole thing to land you at a chord you don&apos;t expect, and then exploit<br/>that for further &quot;functional&quot; harmony, e.g. in this case you keep<br/>moving up in whole steps but somehow end at the fourth. I wanted it to<br/>not work in meantone and only to work in porcupine, and I also<br/>deliberately wanted to NOT stick to to the smallest chain of porcupine<br/>generators possible to make a point. And so that&apos;s what I made. The<br/>end result is that each individual chord progression between two<br/>adjacent chords is easily followable, because it&apos;s something you&apos;ve<br/>heard a million times before, but that the whole thing only works in<br/>porcupine.</p><p>I felt like folks in real life got what I was going for more so than<br/>the folks on the list. My friends suddenly seemed to &quot;get it.&quot; They<br/>described hearing some kind of internal logic in it, although they<br/>were confused at the big picture of what was going on. They seemed to<br/>hear it as some kind of auditory equivalent of the Penrose stairs. One<br/>of my friends who&apos;s a virtuosic sax player figured out during the AXiS<br/>improv that the reason the progression worked was because the minor<br/>thirds were sharp. Before this, they were into &quot;I dunno, microtonal<br/>music is cool, but kind of scary sounding, I just need to listen to it<br/>more to get used to it I guess.&quot; So I won&apos;t claim that this is some<br/>kind of monumental compositional achievement - in fact I&apos;d certainly<br/>say it wasn&apos;t - but I&apos;m happy that my simple experiment seemed to go<br/>well and suggest a direction for me to plow in further. I can utilize<br/>all of these exotic modal resolutions I&apos;ve been trying to work out my<br/>whole life, and when chained together they&apos;ll simply line up<br/>differently when chained together in porcupine than in meantone. And<br/>that&apos;s even besides any concept of exploring new territory with<br/>higher-limit harmony.</p><p>Now on the list, one criticism was that I was still stuck in meantone<br/>thinking by utilizing V-I resolutions. I think that this is a<br/>self-limiting wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing. The idea was also proposed<br/>that I&apos;m not really exploring porcupine[8] unless I learn to hear<br/>porcupine[8] as tonal, but I disagree that the actual porcupine tonal<br/>structure at large depends on that particular MOS. And I certainly<br/>disagree with the notion seems to be that chromatically altering<br/>things is cheating, because we want to limit the amount of porcupine<br/>generators, when I don&apos;t see how the group-theory based notion of a<br/>&quot;generator&quot; has anything to do with musical cognition at all. If<br/>getting people to hear something like v-I in porcupine as strong as<br/>V-I hinges on limiting their exposure to V-I, I think that might be a<br/>sign that we&apos;re headed in the wrong direction. And, besides, if you<br/>disagree, I&apos;ll win by force - I&apos;ll bombard everyone&apos;s ears with V-I in<br/>porcupine until they hear v-i as weak by comparison. Let&apos;s call that a<br/>xen koan.</p><p>&gt; In fact I&apos;d love your input on my answer to Igs&apos; question, and<br/>&gt; on the Shosty preludes &amp; fugues.</p><p>Which question? As for the fugue you sent me, I liked it a lot, and I<br/>heard it as pretty clearly functional, without that much modality<br/>involved, although there were hints of it.</p><p>Here&apos;s another winner: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1f8HjIkU3M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1f8HjIkU3M</a></p><p>&gt; Also note, I refused to call Petr&apos;s example functional.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But I&apos;d also say that the Ebm7 in Cmaj7 -&gt; Ebm7 -&gt; Dm7 -&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; G13b9 -&gt; is pretty functional.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hm. Seems like it&apos;s a &apos;passing chord&apos;.</p><p>It is, but when the Ebm7 resolves downward to Dm7, that&apos;s a pretty<br/>strong resolution. Feel free to make it ||: Cmaj | Ebm7 Ab7 | Dm7 |<br/>G13b9 :|| as well.</p><p>Or try this chord progression: ||: Dbmaj9 | C7#9 | Fm7 A7/E | Ebm9 D7#9#11 :||</p><p>That&apos;s from Just the Two of Us. Note the Fm7 -&gt; A7/E -&gt; Ebm9<br/>resolution, and how smoothly the A7/E resolves to Ebm9. Make sure the<br/>melody over those three chords is Ab -&gt; A -&gt; Bb on top. That&apos;s also a<br/>&quot;passing</p><p>If you happened to be in some scale that contained all of those<br/>chords, Ebm7 would still be a passing chord. It&apos;s kind of like Cmaj -&gt;<br/>G7/D -&gt; Cmaj/E - the G7/D is a passing chord between the two Cmaj<br/>chords. In fact, there are plenty of times when, if you&apos;re harmonizing<br/>a melody, you&apos;d just throw a spurious passing chord like that in just<br/>because it sounds better. But it doesn&apos;t change anything</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s odd. I bought a bunch of recordings and tried several<br/>&gt; times over the years to like them, but never could. One of<br/>&gt; them was even based on rolls recorded by the great man himself.<br/>&gt; But one time Paul Bailey played a Debussy thing on my piano<br/>&gt; after he tuned it, and it was pretty cool.

A<br/>function could be: setting up expectation, fulfilling that<br/>expectation, being a point of repose, moving away from the tonic along<br/>xyz direction, moving away from the tonic along zyx direction, being a<br/>substitute for the tonic, other things we haven&apos;t discovered. There is<br/>a clear subjective component to it.</p><p>History has seen a clear trend in that we have continued to break away<br/>from the diatonic scale in our exploration of functional harmony. We<br/>continually laser in on novel &quot;extended harmonies&quot; and work them in as<br/>part of tonal harmony. It started simply enough with secondary<br/>dominants, which later on turned into throwing dominant 7s over the I<br/>chord and playing the diminished scale over V7 chords. We started<br/>seeing the altered scale used over dominant 7&apos;s as well. People<br/>discovered the blues, which could perhaps be thought of as an<br/>alternate system of functional harmony. People started exploring modal<br/>harmony, initially as a way to get away from common-practice<br/>functionality, and ended up also discovering more functional harmony.<br/>For example:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDgxnjgVFi4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDgxnjgVFi4</a></p><p>The intro is in B dorian, and he then moves to B aeolian for the chord<br/>progressions in the verse. Why did he randomly go to dorian in the<br/>intro? Because the songwriters knew what dorian would sound like<br/>there, and they wanted the feeling of being able to go Bm7 -&gt;<br/>G#m7b5/B, etc. They wanted the dorian &quot;sound.&quot; Maybe the &quot;sound&quot; that<br/>they were getting at was the 7-limit utonality, who knows - either way<br/>they knew what they wanted and went there accordingly, so it was<br/>&quot;functional.&quot;</p><p>Also, the pre-chorus to this song has the chord progression | Gmaj7 |<br/>E/F# F# | Amaj/B | Amaj/B Bmaj | Gmaj7 | E/F# F# | Cmaj/D | B7b13 |.<br/>That Cmaj/D fulfills a clear function before it moves to B7b13 - it&apos;s<br/>used as a temporary resting point, and a very colorful one at that.<br/>It&apos;s also a chord that you&apos;d never hear in common practice harmony,<br/>but it&apos;s still functional. You could call it (VImaj/VII)/iv, I guess,<br/>if you want.</p><p>So where do you draw the line? Well, one of the common functions that<br/>we utilize in chord progressions is that of creating and then<br/>fulfilling expectations. To that extent, many people dismiss lots of<br/>pieces as being non-functional, because they don&apos;t have clear ii-V-I&apos;s<br/>or whatever. These people would still say that ||: Cmaj | Fmaj :|| is<br/>functional, although there&apos;s no V-I in there either. So there&apos;s no<br/>clear definition there, and frankly I wouldn&apos;t trust academic music<br/>theorists to even try to broach the subject.</p><p>The whole thing is also very subjective. If for whatever reason<br/>someone doesn&apos;t hear I-IV-ii-V-I as setting up and then resolving an<br/>expectation, then for that person the progression is certainly not<br/>functional. Or if you hear a piece and for the first verse you can&apos;t<br/>figure out what the tonic is, but then it becomes clear in the chorus,<br/>the functionality of everything you just heard will suddenly<br/>completely change on the second listen. For example, the first time<br/>you listen to this, you won&apos;t hear much functionality in it</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnoN3qEYJS4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnoN3qEYJS4</a></p><p>But after spending some time with it, you&apos;ll start to hear snippets of<br/>really extended functional harmony in it.

The dichotomy is &quot;modal harmony as<br/>consonant vs atonal harmony&quot; as opposed to &quot;modal harmony as<br/>post-common practice &apos;extended&apos; functional harmony.&quot; So although we&apos;ve<br/>been talking about &quot;functional&quot; vs &quot;nonfunctional&quot; harmony, it&apos;s<br/>probably better for us to talk about describing tonal vs atonal<br/>harmony. Note that &quot;atonal&quot; in this sense is not the same thing as<br/>serialist, but functions in a capacity similar to what people like to<br/>do with the eikosany.</p><p>We need to talk more about modality. Modality is - which chord are you<br/>playing now, and what are the chords that are most closely in the<br/>&quot;vicinity&quot; of this chord? If you&apos;re playing C minor, is it F minor<br/>(aeolian) or F major (dorian) that&apos;s most closely related at the<br/>moment? Let&apos;s say it&apos;s F major - what about G minor (dorian) vs G<br/>major (melodic minor)? These determine which mode you&apos;d be using. So<br/>modes encapsulate not only the actual, but suggest a heirarchical<br/>representation of the potential and an accompanying set of<br/>probabilities.</p><p>So what happens then if your tonic is C major, your potential set most<br/>strongly contains G major and F major, you stick mainly to<br/>permutations of those notes to constantly reinforce that &quot;mode,&quot; and<br/>you also try at every juncture to, within this structure, maximize the<br/>expectation/resolution functions?</p><p>&gt; &gt; Maybe the &quot;sound&quot; that they were getting at was the 7-limit<br/>&gt; &gt; utonality, who knows - either way they knew what they wanted<br/>&gt; &gt; and went there accordingly, so it was &quot;functional.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess the distinction is, whether the name of the mode is<br/>&gt; heard as a tonic, with chords relating to it.

If you&apos;re a 14 year old kid, it also implies the tripping you<br/>out function, but that may apply more if you just got Mega Man 8 for<br/>Christmas than if you&apos;ve never played the game and are just discussing<br/>tuning on the internet.</p><p>Then, at the end, it goes Gmaj7 | Fmaj7 | Gmaj7 | Fmaj7.

Furthermore, you can hear the tonic drifting, but the whole<br/>thing is connected in a certain way that Nefertiti is not. The tonics<br/>themselves are related, whereas those of Nefertiti weren&apos;t. And<br/>furthermore, the tonics move slowly enough, with enough pivot chords,<br/>that you can follow the whole thing.</p><p>&gt; &gt; The Gm7b5 -&gt; C7b9 -&gt; Bmaj7#11 (third, fourth and fifth chords<br/>&gt; &gt; of the piece) is a tritone sub landing on B major (lydian),<br/>&gt; &gt; for example.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You&apos;re right, I didn&apos;t hear that as functional.</p><p>If you spend some time with it, you&apos;ll find ways to functionalize it.<br/>Then you throw some passing chords to ease the transition from each<br/>chord to the next, along the lines of whatever functional<br/>relationships you worked out, and suddenly you&apos;re a substitute chord<br/>progression master. Since 12-tet is a heavily tempered system, there<br/>will be zillions of ways to work stuff like that out. And people will<br/>ask you questions about harmony, and you can tell them &quot;Nah bro I<br/>don&apos;t think in terms of theory man, you just have to feel it&quot; and all<br/>that.

Yes, you&apos;re right, when you play C E G and then G B D, it&apos;s<br/>ambiguous as to whether or not you&apos;re playing Ionian or Lydian. You<br/>can play a 6-note hexachord if you&apos;d like, or pick either Ionian or<br/>Lydian to intentionally flesh it out more in one of those directions.</p><p>But look at the original chord, D F B E A D F#. Which F is in the<br/>mode, F or F#? How about C E G B D F# A C#? If you look at the bottom<br/>of that chord, it&apos;s C lydian, but the top makes it look like C#<br/>locrian. Gb D Bb C F A E on bottom looks like it&apos;s going to be lydian<br/>augmented #2, but the E on top is a #6. D A F# B E A# has both a 5 and<br/>a #5 in it. The point is that all of these don&apos;t fit into any mode.</p><p>Let&apos;s go back to D F B E A D F#. There are two ways to handle this<br/>problem in practice: one is to pick a different mode to play over the<br/>bottom half of the chord than the upper half. For the bottom half,<br/>there&apos;s no G or C specified, so we&apos;ll make a creative decision to pick<br/>G and C natural. Then for the bottom half, you could play D dorian,<br/>and over the top, you&apos;d end up playing D mixolydian. I&apos;ve heard the<br/>term &quot;modal field&quot; thrown around to describe this before, but can&apos;t<br/>see much about it on Google.</p><p>A second option might be to find some kind of scale that encompasses<br/>the whole thing. You could smush all of the notes together to get D E<br/>F F# G A B C D, but this is improper. Since the choice of G was left<br/>open, you could change it to G#. In 12-tet this gives you D E F F# G#<br/>A B C D, which is a proper MODMOS of diminished[8]. You could play<br/>that over everything.</p><p>There&apos;s also probably an augmented[9] MODMOS that would work as well.<br/>In general, you can find ways to construct scales around whatever<br/>harmonies you&apos;d like, and there&apos;s often more than one way to do it.</p><p>&gt; With larger<br/>&gt; chords, perhaps some notes are allowed to be outside the<br/>&gt; key and instead common tones between chords are used for<br/>&gt; signaling (like the C &gt; A7b13 &gt; D7#11 &gt; G13b9 &gt; C example<br/>&gt; we saw earlier, which has common dyads in C major). I admit<br/>&gt; it&apos;s a speculative idea I can&apos;t take the time to test at<br/>&gt; the moment.</p><p>How about Cmaj9 -&gt; Eb9 -&gt; Abmaj7 -&gt; Db9#11 -&gt; Cmaj9?</p><p>&gt; &gt; What mode does the progression<br/>&gt; &gt; F#maj7/D -&gt; F#maj7b5/D -&gt; Gm7 signal?<br/>&gt; &gt; Sounds like D altered -&gt; Dorian, but the C# in that first<br/>&gt; &gt; chord doesn&apos;t fit into altered.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If I understand slash notation (I don&apos;t really) I believe<br/>&gt; that&apos;ll look like this<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; E -o--- E ----- F<br/>&gt; C# ---- C -x<br/>&gt; A# -o-- A# -o-- Bb<br/>&gt; F# -o-- F# ---- G<br/>&gt; D -o--- D -o--- D</p><p>The E in the first two chords should be F#. There is an augmented[9]<br/>MODMOS that fits over this chord (D Eb F F# G# A Bb C C# D), but it<br/>would probably sound more natural to just play a different scale over<br/>the bottom than the top of the chord. Throw a D# in there as well to<br/>even further confuse things.</p><p>&gt; Common tones across the whole progression are: D, A#/Bb<br/>&gt; Common tones between adjacent chords are: D, F#, A#/Bb, E<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That doesn&apos;t exactly point to D dorian. Then again, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; a really short progression.</p><p>I&apos;d play D altered over the first one, but at the top of the scale,<br/>rather than going back to D, I&apos;d go to C#. Then I&apos;d do the same thing<br/>over the second scale. Then I&apos;d go to either G dorian or aeolian at<br/>the end. I was basically taking it from</p><p>A-C-Eb-G-B-D -&gt; D-Gb-Bb-C-F -&gt; G-E-Bb-D-F#</p><p>You&apos;d play locrian#2 over the first one, D altered over the second<br/>one, and G melodic minor over the last one. This is the cliche and<br/>standard ii-V-i that we were taught to play to go to minor chords<br/>(more elegant ways of doing this exist). I took the second chord,<br/>which is rooted in D altered, and threw a C# into it. Sooner or later<br/>you start to feel like there&apos;s no point in thinking about chords<br/>signalling modes to begin with, and that it rather works where you can<br/>play one of any number of modes around any chord. Sometimes there are<br/>chords that no commonly used mode will fit.</p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=98930 href="#98930">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/9/2011 9:13:01 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- David Bowen &lt;dmb0317@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; What mode does the progression<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; F#maj7/D -&gt; F#maj7b5/D -&gt; Gm7 signal?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like D altered -&gt; Dorian, but the C# in that first<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; chord doesn&apos;t fit into altered.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If I understand slash notation (I don&apos;t really) I believe<br/>&gt; &gt; that&apos;ll look like this<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; E# -o-- E# -o-- F<br/>&gt; &gt; C# ---- C -x<br/>&gt; &gt; A# -o-- A# -o-- Bb<br/>&gt; &gt; F# -o-- F# ---- G<br/>&gt; &gt; D -o--- D -o--- D<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Shouldn&apos;t the Es in the first two chords be E#s?</p><p>D&apos;oh!

I think you might get better results if you just draw 7 blank<br/>spaces, _ _ _ _ _ _ _, and then fill in the blanks with the first<br/>chord. If the first chord leaves a few diatonic positions ambiguous,<br/>I&apos;d leave it blank. Then, for the next chord, fill in the remaining<br/>blanks. If one of the notes in this chord clashes with the note you<br/>have written, then change it, and change as few notes as possible. The<br/>mode you end up with at every step of this process will be the most<br/>natural sounding mode to play during each step.

It gets even messier when you use the diminished scale<br/>over dominant 7 chords. This is basically the beginning of the whole<br/>system breaking down and revealing that what we&apos;re doing is trying to<br/>fit proper scales to the underlying harmony, not the other way around.<br/>But it still works well enough.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I can tell you for a fact<br/>&gt; &gt; that common tones have a lot to do with what mode you&apos;d likely<br/>&gt; &gt; find the most natural sounding over a chord. // I wouldn&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; claim that D F B E A D F# &quot;signals&quot; the diminished/augmented<br/>&gt; &gt; MODMOS&apos;s I laid out in that email, but I would claim that those<br/>&gt; &gt; scales might be decent choices to play over the chord, although<br/>&gt; &gt; I like the modal field approach more.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, it&apos;s just that it&apos;s got to signal something if it&apos;s going<br/>&gt; to be functional - some way of relating the chords to one<br/>&gt; another.

Maybe it&apos;s as simple as the list of<br/>&gt; chord roots, I dunno.</p><p>I tend to think of it as some kind of, uh, musico-spatial reasoning<br/>that we end up building. Melodic motion is pretty floaty, so we have<br/>to learn how to make sense of it all. We end up with a set of learned<br/>behaviors that cue us into piecing what&apos;s going on differently in<br/>different contexts. Hence when you listen to Knowsur&apos;s album in<br/>14-tet, you hear &quot;majorness&quot; and &quot;minorness&quot; in it. For example,<br/>although this could theoretically be in any mode at all, I predict<br/>you&apos;ll probably hear it as being very loosely in Mixolydian - meaning<br/>you&apos;ll hear the base sonority as being &quot;Major&quot; over &quot;minor&quot; (if you<br/>had to pick one) and having a b7 instead of a #7:</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9NlHaWllwU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9NlHaWllwU</a></p><p>I also predict you&apos;ll hear this being very loosely centered around<br/>minor, either perhaps Aeolian or a bastardized Aeolian with a neutral<br/>sixth:</p><p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/knowsur/haneru">http://soundcloud.com/knowsur/haneru</a></p><p>I hear a few pretty sweet porcupine-ish or mohajira-ish moments in<br/>this as well, but on the whole I&apos;d say I hear it as minor over major.</p><p>As a last note, I was showing Mark Nowitzky my functional porcupine<br/>example yesterday. The melody goes something like<br/>G-Av-Av-Bb-Bb-C-C-D-E-C-D-B-C, where G-Av-Bb-C is 3 equal divisions of<br/>the 4/3. Mark claimed he heard the melody as G-A-A-B-B-C-C, where the<br/>B is a major third above the root. He heard two whole steps in a row,<br/>so his brain clued the result into major third mode - never mind that<br/>these are actually 10/9 whole steps and two of them land you at 6/5.<br/>Then the C was a clear 4/3 away from where I started, so he heard C.<br/>These are the kind of signaling cues I&apos;m talking about, and I think<br/>some evolved version of this concept applies to chord progressions as<br/>well.</p><p>&gt; Also, I wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks!

So<br/>let&apos;s say you&apos;re starting with Mixolydian. You must first immediately<br/>rip off the Who by playing Cmaj -&gt; Bbmaj -&gt; Fmaj for a little bit.<br/>Once you get comfortable with that progression, your next task is to<br/>explore using borrowed chords to create a modal shift. So let&apos;s try<br/>borrowing a chord from Dorian and throwing it in the cycle</p><p>||: Cmaj | Ebmaj | Bbmaj | Fmaj :||</p><p>Now it changes colors repeatedly through the cycle. Or, is it that<br/>you&apos;re really signaling the scale C D Eb E F G A Bb C, and this &quot;color<br/>shift&quot; is just an ordinary chord progression change within that scale?<br/>The answer: both.</p><p>There&apos;s lots more, but maybe that&apos;ll help you get some ideas. A few<br/>guidelines: if you just borrow chords at random from other random<br/>modes, the whole thing might sound disconnected. For example, Cmaj -&gt;<br/>Gbmaj is like borrowing a chord from Locrian, but it&apos;ll probably just<br/>sound like some kind of vaguely diaschismic or perhaps just<br/>disconnected mush. To avoid this, you might want to try only borrowing<br/>chords from one or two modes in either direction on the above chart,<br/>expanding more as your ear starts to branch out and hear these new and<br/>often very abstract relationships. And for some reason I like<br/>borrowing chords from darker modes more than brighter modes, but maybe<br/>that&apos;s just me. So for example, the C-Gb root movement works better in<br/>the context of ||: Cm7 | Gbmaj7#11 | Fm7 | Bb13 :||, where you&apos;re<br/>moving from Aeolian to Locrian.

Like, I can&apos;t even tell what interval the main melody is harmonized with--is it a 3rd or a 4th?</p><p>Igs, THIS is what I was talking about when I posted the link to the<br/>Frere Jacques study. What you&apos;re saying is that you are having trouble<br/>finding the &quot;roots&quot; for the dyads in this piece of music, as does it<br/>seem like you&apos;re having difficult figuring out what the individual<br/>pitches are, which is the same thing as finding the root for each<br/>pitch in isolation. Since this process can be so difficult, we can<br/>acquire a set of rules to aid us in doing it, and these rules can be<br/>improved or increased with musical training. Likewise, the learned<br/>memory of the melody for &quot;Frere Jacques&quot; can provide a listener with a<br/>set of rules to predict and follow the roots that should come next,<br/>which dramatically alters how VF estimation occurs.</p><p>Furthermore, there really is no &quot;correct&quot; way to do this, who&apos;s to say<br/>that it&apos;s not suspended as you said? Just because Carl and Gene and I<br/>heard it as neutral-ish major, who&apos;s to say that that&apos;s &quot;right&quot; and<br/>that the interpretation of it as suspended is &quot;wrong?&quot; That was the<br/>point of the study, to demonstrate that a set of learned rules like<br/>this actually completely dominates VF perception.</p><p>For the record, it&apos;s both, thirds and fourths in alternation; he&apos;s<br/>arpeggiating a 7-equal pentatonic scale.</p><p>One last question, what about this knowsur piece?</p><p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/knowsur/haneru/">http://soundcloud.com/knowsur/haneru/</a></p><p>Give it a listen, then afterwards go to <a href="http://rot13.com">rot13.com</a> and type this in:<br/>Guvf vf zbfgyl zvabe, jvgu fbzr &quot;arhgeny&quot; ryrzragf guebja va, ohg gur<br/>gbavp vf trarenyyl zvabe, zber fcrpvsvpnyyl n zvabe 7 pubeq.</p><p>See if you agree.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ll agree it&apos;s definitely not minor, but it sounds really really NOT major.
