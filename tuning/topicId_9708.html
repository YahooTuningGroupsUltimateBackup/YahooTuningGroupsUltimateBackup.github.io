Kampe in 1864 per order of V.F. Odoievsky (1804-1869).  I even got to play it.  The octaves are so out of tune that one could not get what the &quot;enharmonic&quot; nature of the insturment was all about.  However, I was informed that younmg Tchaikovsky used to play on it.</p><p>Concerts have been terrific and I will certainly share more of this when I get back. The big Dom concert is tomorrow evening.  Wyschnegradsky is doing really well here.  Most Russians have never heard of him.</p><p>The real treat was Kazan in Tartarstan where a thousand people were snapping their fingers to my premiere of Urartu.  On Saturday it is the premiere of Rama.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div>
