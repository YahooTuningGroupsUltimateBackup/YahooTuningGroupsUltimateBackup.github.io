All support the syntonic comma (i.e., show net microtonal<br/>&gt; motion) in the progression I-vi-ii-V-I.  All have two major second<br/>&gt; intervals: four fifths do NOT equal a major third.</p><p>In reference to 53-tet, I&apos;m tempted to state the matter from a<br/>slightly different angle, doubtless a bit more &quot;medievalist&quot; and<br/>Pythagorean. Both Pythagorean and 53-tet do have regular or &quot;ditonic&quot;<br/>major thirds equal precisely to four fifths, but _additionally_<br/>support two other M3-like intervals, close to 5:4 and 9:7.</p><p>Please let me emphasize that this statement doesn&apos;t really contradict<br/>Paul&apos;s, because for someone using 53-tet to play music where an<br/>analysis like &quot;I-vi-ii-V-I&quot; would be likely, I&apos;d guess that the small<br/>M3 close to 5:4 would be taken as the norm. This version of M3 at<br/>17/53 octave is a scale step smaller than what I would call the<br/>&quot;regular&quot; M3 at 18/53 octave (four 31/53 octave fifths minus two<br/>octaves), which in turn is a step smaller than the &quot;large&quot; M3 at 19/53<br/>octave (~9:7).</p><p>Interestingly, a Pythagorean tuning if extended to 17 notes (16<br/>fifths) yields intervals very close to these:</p><p>                  Pythagorean                  53-tet</p><p>Small M3          octave - 8 fifths            17/53 octave<br/>(tetratonic)      8192:6561 (~384.36 cents)    (~384.91 cents)<br/>                      (compare with 5:4, ~386.31 cents)</p><p>Regular M3        4 5ths - 2 octaves           18/53 octave<br/>(ditonic)         81:64 (~407.82 cents)        (~407.55 cents)</p><p>Large M3          16 5ths - 9 octaves          19/53 octave<br/>(octotonic)       43046721:33554432<br/>                  (~431.28 cents)              (~430.19 cents)<br/>                       (compare with 9:7, ~435.08 cents)</p><p>To describe these three M3 alternatives in either Pythagorean or<br/>53-tet, I&apos;ve borrowed some medieval terms. The regular M3 is<br/>&quot;ditonic,&quot; equal to precisely two 9:8 whole-tones in Pythagorean, and<br/>two 9/53-octave whole-tones in 53-tet. The small M3 is &quot;tetratonic,&quot;<br/>equal to an octave minus _four_ whole tones -- in 53-tet, that is, to<br/>53 - 36 or 17 scale steps. The large M3 is &quot;octotonic,&quot; being equal to<br/>eight 9:8 whole-tones minus one octave (or 16 fifths minus nine<br/>octaves) in Pythagorean; and likewise 8 9/53-octave whole-tones minus<br/>one octave (72 - 53) or 19 scale steps in 53-tet.</p><p>In either of these very similar tuning systems, the small major third<br/>is also equal to a regular tone (9:8 or 9/53 octave) plus a _tonus<br/>minor_ or &quot;small whole-tone&quot; very close to 10:9 (65536:59049 or<br/>~180.45 cents in Pythagorean, 8/53 octave or ~181.13 cents in<br/>53-tet). The large major third is also equal to a regular tone plus a<br/>_tonus major_ or &quot;large whole-tone&quot; very close to 8:7 (4782969:4194304<br/>or ~227.37 cents in Pythagorean, 10/53 octave or ~226.42 cents in<br/>53-tet).</p><p>&gt; (I have long considered 53-tET to be a beautiful thing, since its<br/>&gt; base microtonal interval falls nicely between a Pythagorean comma<br/>&gt; and a syntonic comma, but I&apos;ve never written music in it...)</p><p>Yes, at about 22.64 cents, 1/53-octave is not far from the mean of the<br/>Pythagorean comma (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents) and the syntonic comma<br/>(81:80, ~21.51 cents). I find it interesting that while a pure<br/>extended Pythagorean tuning gives a slightly better approximation of<br/>9:7 for the large M3, 53-tet is a bit closer to 5:4 for the small M3.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
