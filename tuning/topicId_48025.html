U of I - Partch and Johnston?<br/>&gt; Hello?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron Hunt</p><p>I was born and raised in Chicago and did most of my 20th-century<br/>microtonal work there.  The Chicago area (Mount Prospect and<br/>Schaumburg) was also the place that Motorola Scalatrons were designed<br/>and built.  In the years that I lived there, I met Erv Wilson, John<br/>Chalmers, and Easley Blackwood, and in the course of travel promoting<br/>the Scalatron, I also met Ben Johnston, Lou Harrison, Danlee<br/>Mitchell, Anton de Beer, Leigh Gerdine, Don Ellis, Ivor Darreg, Larry<br/>Hanson, Jonathan Glasier, and others.</p><p>I moved to Los Angeles in 1979 with the expectation that I would be<br/>in more frequent contact with others working with alternate tunings,<br/>but that did not turn out to be the case.  (But I did meet Genn Prior<br/>and Kraig Grady.)  My daughter was born a year later, and the ensuing<br/>responsibilities led to my decision to put my microtonal activities<br/>indefinitely on hold.</p><p>I moved back to the Midwest in 1987 (southern Illinois), and about 6<br/>years ago I decided to start work on a book on microtonality.  Since<br/>establishing contact with a few members of the Tuning List a couple<br/>of years ago, the book has been put on hold, while my microtonal work<br/>is now proceeding at a pace faster than I ever expected -- in spite<br/>of the fact that I haven&apos;t laid eyes on any other microtonalists in<br/>over 15 years.  Once the work on the development and documentation of<br/>the Sagittal notation is completed, I expect to devote more time to<br/>composing (and also getting back to working on that book).</p><p>Aaron J., I visit the Chicago area occasionally, and if you want to<br/>get together sometime, please let me know.  But even if you don&apos;t<br/>have the opportuning to see others face to face, I think that a<br/>support group like the Tuning List is a valuable resource that can&apos;t<br/>be matched by a smaller, less varied group in a single locality.</p><p>--George</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@which.net&#x3E;</h3><span>10/21/2003 12:41:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 20/10/03 20:39, Carlos at <a href="mailto:garciasuarez@ya.com">garciasuarez@ya.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Guys,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some of you seem to assume all the list member resides in the US.
