I&apos;ve never been that enamored of<br/>traditional &quot;harmonic&quot; chords on the piano.  There is a good reason<br/>the piano is classified as a &quot;percussion&quot; instrument.</p><p>I think the true nature of the piano comes out in modern &quot;percussive&quot;<br/>works, like Boulez piano sonatas and such like...</p><p>By the way, I would say Stockhausen, but after what he said about the<br/>World Trade Center disaster (great art!) I am boycotting all his<br/>works and performances...

I believe the effects of temperaments would vary<br/>greatly depending on the kind of timbres used.  Paul Erlich reminded<br/>me there with sine waves there isn&apos;t even any way to tune by<br/>beating... since the beating is from the combined partials, not the<br/>fundamental....</p><p>_______ _______ __________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Clark &#x3C;CACCOLA@NET1PLUS.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/20/2001 10:34:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Je me demande... si un piano sonne mieux avec des cordes qui sont<br/>&gt; &gt; neuves ?</p><p>...new strings...</p><p>Clark</p></div><h3>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>9/20/2001 2:21:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Clark &lt;CACCOLA@N...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28374">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/28374</a></p><p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Je me demande... si un piano sonne mieux avec des cordes qui<br/>sont<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; neuves ?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...new strings...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Clark</p><p>You&apos;re right, Clark...
