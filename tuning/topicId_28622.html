Where is schismic temperament in your rankings of 5-limit<br/>&gt; temperaments? Isn&apos;t it &quot;better&quot; than #1 by your measure?</p><p>I&apos;m not sure.  It probably gets vetoed for being too complex.  I don&apos;t pay<br/>much attention to the 5-limit results.</p><p>&gt; 2. Wouldn&apos;t you find an infinite number of temperaments that<br/>&gt; are &quot;better&quot; than your #1 temperaments by your measure, if you<br/>&gt; carried your search further and further out?</p><p>Probably, certainly enough that they would swamp the useful results.  If<br/>you recall the initial data, this is what happened with the 5-limit.</p><p>&gt; 3. If the answer to question 2 is &quot;yes&quot;, do you think that maybe one<br/>&gt; should put more weight on having a low &quot;complexity measure&quot;, and come<br/>&gt; up with a ranking that, while not too subjective, is comprehensive in<br/>&gt; that no, let along an infinite number, of possibilities are left out?</p><p>If you can find one that makes sense.  For now, it works well enough by<br/>restricting the seed ETs and excluding anything beyond a given level of<br/>complexity.  You can then apply a truly subjective measure to the<br/>temperaments that make the list.</p><p>                  Graham</p></div><h3><a id=28633 href="#28633">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/26/2001 12:38:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., graham@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; Paul asked:</p><p>&gt; &gt; do you think that maybe one<br/>&gt; &gt; should put more weight on having a low &quot;complexity measure&quot;, and<br/>come<br/>&gt; &gt; up with a ranking that, while not too subjective, is<br/>comprehensive in<br/>&gt; &gt; that no, let along an infinite number, of possibilities are left<br/>out?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you can find one that makes sense.</p><p>I bet Gene can do that . . . also, I think a &quot;weighted complexity&quot;<br/>measure, with ratios of 3 somewhat more important than ratios of 5,<br/>etc., would be better.

What excited me about Miracle is that the intervals of 11 aren&apos;t<br/>in general any more complex than the 9-limit.  So it removes the<br/>temptation to use a core 5-limit harmony with higher limit elaborations.<br/>The aim of the program was to find more temperaments like Miracle, in<br/>their respective limits.</p><p>Finding meantone-like temperaments should be easier without the program.<br/>You can start with the 5-limit approximation, and then find the closest<br/>ones to the higher limits.  I suppose there may be some value in doing<br/>this for alternative timbres.  Getting the existing program to work with<br/>such a complexity formula wouldn&apos;t be trivial, but you can probably work<br/>it out if you poke around for long enough.  A similar metric for<br/>calculating the errors would probably be appropriate.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div>
