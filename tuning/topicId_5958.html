In 31-tet, they are indeed equal, at ~38.7 cents.</p><p>In terms of Easley Blackwood&apos;s scheme, if I recall it correctly, we<br/>have the whole-tone equal to 5/31 octave and the diatonic semitone<br/>equal to 3/31 octave, giving us a ratio &quot;R&quot; between these two<br/>intervals of 5:3.</p><p>Maybe &quot;fifthtone&quot; could also fit 30-tet, since here 1/30 octave is<br/>indeed exactly a fifth of 1/6 octave, the whole-tone of 200 cents. In<br/>31-tet, both the whole-tone and its five divisions are smaller, so<br/>that in both tunings the whole-tone is divided into five parts.</p><p>If one wanted to argue historical precedent, then maybe &quot;fifthtone&quot;<br/>should be default apply especially to 31-tet, based on the approximate<br/>models of Vicentino and Colonna, and the more mathematically precise<br/>models in the later 17th century by Rossi and Huyghens.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=5977 href="#5977">ðŸ”—</a>Joe Monzo &#x3C;monz@xxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/1999 5:09:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks to Daniel Wolf for confirming that Haba&apos;s 16th Quartet<br/>is, as I thought, in 31-tET, and to Margo Schulter for her<br/>historical speculations.</p><p>I believe this is the only piece Haba wrote in 31-tET, and<br/>also believe it was due to his interaction with Fokker (in<br/>the 1960s?), and not to any specific interest in the historical<br/>theorists mentioned by Margo (excepting Huyghens, on whose<br/>work Fokker&apos;s was based).</p><p>Haba&apos;s microtonal works and theories were mainly in 24-tET<br/>and 36-tET.</p><p>Haba possessed absolute pitch, and his interest in<br/>microtonality in the first place stems from his exposure<br/>to Wallachian folk-songs in family music-making with his<br/>brothers and mother when he was child; he recognized when<br/>he began his musical studies that these songs contained<br/>intervals outside the 12-tET scale.</p><p>After high school, he obtained teaching jobs while continuing<br/>to study music, eventually going to the Prague Conservatory at<br/>the outbreak of World War 1, until he was drafted.</p><p>Stationed in Vienna near the end of the war, Haba<br/>encountered Willi von Moellendorff, who performed on a<br/>quarter-tone harmonium, and he wrote his first 24-tET<br/>compositions.  He later became a pupil of Franz Schreker,<br/>attended Schoenberg&apos;s Private Society concerts, and became<br/>somewhat of a follower of Schoenberg&apos;s ideas; he was strongly<br/>influenced by the &apos;athematic&apos; approach used by Schoenberg<br/>in _Erwartung_.</p><p>Haba followed Schreker when he moved to Berlin, and there<br/>studied &apos;oriental&apos; music (meaning near-eastern) and met<br/>Ferrucio Busoni, who had advocated 36-tET in his _Sketch<br/>for a New Aesthetic of Music_.  Busoni encouraged Haba<br/>more than anyone else to continue his microtonal explorations,<br/>and Haba began composing in 18- and 36-tET.</p><p>At this point, Haba decided to set up a microtonal school,<br/>but was forced out of Berlin when the Nazis came to power.<br/>He returned to Prague and pursued his dream, until after<br/>10 years of resistance he finally established a microtonal<br/>school at the Conservatory, which lasted until 1951, when<br/>the Soviet-backed communist government dissolved it.</p><p>(info from PhD dissertation on Haba&apos;s _New Harmonielehre_,<br/>by Suzette Mary Battan, Eastman School of Music, 1980)</p><p>-monz</p><p>Joseph L.
