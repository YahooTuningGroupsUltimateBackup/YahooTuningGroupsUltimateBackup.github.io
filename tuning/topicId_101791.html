The top rated rank two temperament on the page is the unnamed 58&amp;8d, which throws 126/125 into the mix. That has a low enough badness figure it should have been noted and named.

Then, if 9 generators plus half an octave make a 3/1, then it clearly tells me it must be something similar to the BP neutral second as 9 steps in the BP chromatic are apped to 15/7 (which is ~17.5 cents wider). And if 11 of them are mapped to 5/2 here and 63/25 in BP, then I just can&apos;t help comparing the similar step sizes.<br/>Also, if 8 generators minus half an octave make 11/8, this clearly shows that these 8 generators are approximately a quartertone narrower than an octave; again, similar to BP.<br/>Finally, if you only need to add two more generators to that to map 13/8, then it&apos;s reminiscent of BP once again since two steps of the chromatic BP are only a few cents away from 13/11.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2011 5:35:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I was cooking up something for pele temperament, which<br/>&gt; tempers out 196/195, 352/351 and 364/363, but it ended up<br/>&gt; with the 352/351 comma not playing any role.

So for what I was doing with my Tablets article on the Xenwiki, it seemed to be sort of a fifth wheel. On the other hand, adding it in to produce the pele I started with doesn&apos;t produce much tuning damage, and drops the rank by one, giving the more pleasant 2.3.5 for a transversal subgroup, rather than <a href="http://2.3.5.13/11">2.3.5.13/11</a>, so I think I&apos;ll use it anyway.</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/11/2011 10:08:02 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;genewardsmith&quot; &lt;genewardsmith@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; It wasn&apos;t required for any of the essentially tempered chords, and doesn&apos;t seem to lend itself to producing them.</p><p>Actually, it does give essentially tempered chords if I remove a restriction on how I generate candidate chords.
