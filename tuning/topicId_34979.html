You can get some from<br/>Manuel&apos;s scale archive, somewhere at <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf</a></p><p>Probably the idea with that scale is to express quartertones with simple<br/>integer ratios.  They didn&apos;t have cents in those days.  There&apos;s a strong<br/>Greek influence in all this -- al-Farabi was well read in Greek texts,<br/>more so than European scholars of his day as more had been translated to<br/>Arabic than Latin.  The first part of al-Farabi&apos;s treatise is a list of<br/>Ptolemy&apos;s scales, which must therefore include the equable diatonic, which<br/>is essentially the one Touma gives on p.21.</p><p>The Pythagorean scale from al-Urmawi (Touma pp21-22) is what Paul was<br/>thinking of.  It is more recent than al-Farabi, but has less to do with<br/>modern Arab tuning.  It&apos;s a lot more like Persian tuning, and may have<br/>been Persian influenced back then.  Owen Wright&apos;s book (it&apos;s in Touma&apos;s<br/>bibliography) is excellent for this.  It seems that the<br/>Pythagorean/schismic notation was intended to show neutral thirds although<br/>if you take it literally it doesn&apos;t sound like that.</p><p>Incidentally, Farmer&apos;s &quot;An Old Moorish Lute Tutor&quot; happens to have fallen<br/>into my lap.  The subject, probably earlier than the late C16th Morocco,<br/>describes a Pythagorean tuning and fretting.</p><p>                          Graham</p></div><h3><a id=34998 href="#34998">ðŸ”—</a>joemonz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2002 12:34:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi lev36 and paul,</p><p>&gt; From:  &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>&gt; Date:  Wed Feb 27, 2002  2:33 pm<br/>&gt; Subject:  Re: Middle-eastern tunings: Arabic, Turkish, Saz<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;lev36&quot; &lt;lev@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;paulerlich&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;lev36&quot; &lt;lev@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or to an older, somewhat<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pythagorean system devised by al-Farabi (c.f.

This does not imply an equal temperament, or any kind<br/>of temperament, but is a useful simplification.</p><p>Looking at the 17-note unequal tuning that you posted, I am fascinated<br/>to find that many identical intervals occur in a 12-note organ tuning<br/>suggested by an English treatise of 1373, recommending that pipes for<br/>added semitones be given the average length of two pipes forming a 9:8<br/>tone. This results in the 18:17:16 division mentioned by Boethius and<br/>theorists, who traditionally however used this division to show that a<br/>whole-tone cannot be divided into two _equal_ parts using integer<br/>ratios, rather than to define the semitones for an actual tuning<br/>(typically the Pythagorean 256:243 and 2187:2048).</p><p>A complication is that a medieval musician might have applied this<br/>14th-century English method in at least two ways. One approach would be to<br/>tune the usual notes of the regular medieval European gamut, a chain of<br/>fifths from Bb to B, using pure fifths at 3:2, and then to use the<br/>18:17:16 rule for the remaining _musica ficta_ accidentals (&quot;invented&quot;<br/>notes) outside this _musica recta_ gamut.</p><p>In this approach, the whole-tone A-B would be divided A-Bb-B in the<br/>usual Pythagorean way, with A-Bb a diatonic semitone or limma at<br/>256:243 (~90.22 cents), and Bb-B a chromatic semitone or apotome  at<br/>2187:2048 (~113.69 cents). Here is a .scl file for this solution,<br/>showing the many intervals identical to those of your tuning:</p><p>! org1373a.scl<br/>!<br/>English organ tuning (1373) with 18:17:16 ficta semitones (Eb-G#)<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 18/17<br/> 9/8<br/> 81/68<br/> 81/64<br/> 4/3<br/> 24/17<br/> 3/2<br/> 27/17<br/> 27/16<br/> 16/9<br/> 243/128<br/> 2/1</p><p>A different approach, one favored by the scholar Mark Lindley, tunes<br/>the seven-note diatonic scale (F-B) in Pythagorean, but applies the<br/>18:17:16 rule to Bb as well as the other accidentals, producing a<br/>12-note tuning like this:</p><p>! org1373a.scl<br/>!<br/>English organ tuning (1373) with 18:17:16 accidental semitones (Eb-G#)<br/> 12<br/>!<br/> 18/17<br/> 9/8<br/> 81/68<br/> 81/64<br/> 4/3<br/> 24/17<br/> 3/2<br/> 27/17<br/> 27/16<br/> 243/136<br/> 243/128<br/> 2/1</p><p>The Scala scale archives also includes boulliau.scl, a different<br/>transposition of this second version with a 32/17 rather than 243/128<br/>for the major seventh -- in this arrangement, all the steps are<br/>identical to those of your 17-note scale, forming a subset of it as<br/>pointed out by the Scala COMPARE feature.</p><p>Please let me add that learning a small amount about the tunings of<br/>theorists such as Ibn Sina and Al Farabi has much enriched my own<br/>musicmaking, and thank you for sharing your expertise with us here.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=36357 href="#36357">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/12/2002 1:57:26 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;ertugrulInanc&quot; &lt;ertugrulinanc@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; As far as I have come up with, the only scientific article on saz<br/>&gt; tuning was written by Yal&ccedil;&yacute;n Tura (T&uuml;rk M&ucirc;sikisinin Mes&apos;eleleri,<br/>&gt; Istanbul 1988, pg. 158).
