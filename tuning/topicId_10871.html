I was really touched that so many of you<br/>took the time to reply so constructively to a total stranger. So I sent<br/>off my subs to the JI Network today and ordered the JI Primer, and I&apos;ll<br/>be following up the leads you all provided at a slow and steady rate.<br/>And I won&apos;t be unsubscribing from this list, even though I&apos;ll be<br/>deleting many messages only half read.<br/>    So as all the best B-movie villains say, then, &quot;You may not hear<br/>from me for some time, but I&apos;ll be watching and waiting for when the<br/>time is right.&quot;<br/>    Yours - Adam Bushell</p><p>&lt;&lt;phew,  I managed to get through the whole letter without publicly<br/>wondering what all this Anphoria business is&gt;&gt;</p></div>
