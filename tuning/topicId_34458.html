The success of this movement is Bach&apos;s intention to emphasize<br/>only one size of major second for melodic reasons.  Other semitones possible<br/>would include: 90, 96, and 102 cents.  Bach&apos;s choice here was the biggest of<br/>the semitones.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>manuel.op.de.coul@eon-benelux.com</h3><span>2/19/2002 5:53:07 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Johnny,</p><p>There are 39 different intervals. I&apos;ve heard of a program which<br/>easily counts this for you...<br/>The largest semitone is indeed 108 cents. Hmm, I must really<br/>find the Koopman record you mentioned.</p><p>Manuel</p></div>
