I taked this<br/>decision with a certain degree of sadness but certainly not with angry or<br/>resentment. Since it could be easily misinterpreted as resulting of<br/>apparent conflict with Paul, I would like to express clearly that my<br/>problem was not at this level.</p><p>I posted my first message the first day of august and I ceased from writing<br/>on my website the august 20. I see I was unconsciously waiting for<br/>something impossible. With efforts it is possible to write ideas in English<br/>(or in German, or ...) but it was not (to me) truly possible to feel<br/>belonging at a new community. First, I escaped too much nuances. Secondly I<br/>did&apos;nt write what I wanted. I was very restricted by what I was able to<br/>write in a reasonable amount of time. Moreover I didn&apos;t find how to keep<br/>focus on what I would find pleasure to write. It&apos;s only on that base I<br/>lived frustration in my dicussions with Paul. I saw mountain of questions<br/>growing which seemed to me delaying the moment where I could find pleasure<br/>to expose my ideas. There is no reason to blame here.</p><p>I had decided to leave completely the List to return more easily to my<br/>searching and writing rituals but at the precise moment having a last look<br/>on messages, I saw, in last ones, those of Margo Schulter (#15038) &quot;A<br/>gentle introduction to neo-Gothic progressions&quot;. I changed my mind. I shall<br/>certainly scan the List from time to time hoping to find such pearls. If I<br/>underline here a coincidence having found an ultimate pleasure at decision<br/>time, it is not to minimize other moments or sources of pleasure. Otherwise<br/>I would not have stayed until now.</p><p>My decision is to write now in French. Maybe I shall post announces of new<br/>papers if I think someone could be interested. Besides I shall seek for<br/>someone to translate some papers. Finally, I keep the same URL and address.</p><p>Now my last answers in discussion about COHERENCE, then a SPECIAL HALLOWEEN<br/>and a final CHALLENGE.</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>HEURISTIC APPROACH OF COHERENCE  Last Part<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p> [ I shall answer only few questions. I apologize for<br/>   leaving without answers a long list of questions I<br/>   keeped on a file. ]</p><p>----------</p><p>Quoting 14367 :</p><p>&lt;&lt; The 7 degrees arising in gammier 9 are a macrotonal<br/>   property of the 13 tones took as a whole. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Paul wrote (14371) :</p><p>&lt;&lt; I understand that, but it seems that you have to construct<br/>   a 13-tone chordoid scale _before_ you can get your 7-tone<br/>   scale. That is what I think I&apos;ll have a hard time with.<br/>   I&apos;d argue that the diatonic scale is musico-historically<br/>   and logically prior to the 13-tone chordoid. &gt;&gt;</p><p>(1) About &quot;musico-historically&quot;, I try to translate a precedent Ricoeur<br/>quotation.</p><p>    &lt;&lt; For historicism, to understand is to find anterior forms,<br/>       sources, evolution direction. With structuralism, that are<br/>       arrangements, systematic organizations in a given state<br/>       that are first intelligible. Ferdinand de Saussure begin<br/>       to introduce this reversing with distinction between<br/>       language and speech. &gt;&gt;</p><p>(2) For sure, people didn&apos;t need Saussure before begining to speak, to make<br/>grammars or to define style rules.</p><p>(3) The 13 tones are used to reveal hidden properties about scales used<br/>since millenaries. Besides, choosing one of the 16 proper(*) modes of these<br/>13 tones, like the well-known 1 9/8 5/4 4/3 3/2 5/3 15/8, there exist a<br/>family of gammiers (having same tonal generator) in which this mode is a<br/>proper mode. There exist also other gammiers or gammoids like the Indian<br/>one (1 3 9 27 45 81 243) in which this particular mode is also a proper<br/>mode (meaning a contiguous path across the octave in a specific set). To<br/>sum up, this 7-tone scale has not only one possibility to be framed like<br/>the 13-tone gammier #9 structure (that was only heuristically built here).</p><p>(4) However, with the tools, I can assert that the minimal coherent set of<br/>tones in which this contiguous path is possible is precisely the gammier #9<br/>for which the matrix (1 3 5 9 15) define not only the tones but all the<br/>triplets of the composition law.</p><p>(5) Open question : &quot;Could mode confining (about pitches) be the simplest<br/>(conscious) way to approximately obtain (unconscious) algebraic structure<br/>confining (about intervals between pitches)?&quot;</p><p>(*) &quot;proper&quot; == &quot;propre&quot; in sense of property of the set as a whole.</p><p>--------</p><p>Quoting 14367 :</p><p>&lt;&lt; Then, If you apply that to your lattice you&apos;ll span<br/>   the 13 tones I name gammier 9. Why gammier rather than<br/>   chordoid? For there exist supplemental properties like<br/>   abelian group isomorphism between (factorization) class<br/>   of tones G/2S and cyclic integers Z/7. The paths in its<br/>   factorization lattice are the musical modes. &gt;&gt;</p><p>Paul wrote (14371) :</p><p>&lt;&lt; Can you explain this? &gt;&gt;</p><p>(1) Explanation about what is an isomorphism like here</p><p>           G/2S --&gt; Z/n</p><p>Let F be a bijection (or a &quot;biunivoque&quot; application) of a set A structured<br/>with the composition law (*) on a set B structured with the composition law<br/>(+).

Let S be a set with an algebraic<br/>structure and R be an equivalence relation on S. Then S/R is the set of<br/>classes corresponding to the partition of S by the equivalence relation R.<br/>If there is a morphism between S and S/R (with the standard law of<br/>composition on classes), then the equivalence relation is called a congruence.</p><p>(4) Explanation about the three equivalence relations used to construct the<br/>structured sets of classes G/2, G/S, G/2S and Z/n.</p><p>( x = y mod n )  additive equivalence meaning there exist k<br/>                 in Z such that  x = y + n*k</p><p>( x = y mod 2 )  multiplicative equivalence meaning there exist<br/>                 k in z such that  x = y * 2^k</p><p>( x = y mod S )  modal equivalence meaning there exist k in<br/>                 srutal matrix S such that  x = y * k</p><p>The srutal matrix S associated with a gammoid is the matrix generated by<br/>the tonal generator of this gammoid.</p><p>    Examples :</p><p>    For the chinese gammier (#1), the tonal generator (minimal steps)<br/>    is (10/9 9/8 6/5), then the matrix S is</p><p>         | 10/9   9/8    6/5<br/>    -----|-------------------<br/>    10/9 |   1   81/80  27/25<br/>         |<br/>     9/8 | 80/81   1    16/15<br/>         |<br/>     6/5 | 25/27 15/16    1</p><p>     Two tones x and y in the chinese gammier separated by an element<br/>     k in S belongs to the same tone class (degree).</p><p>     For the gammier #9, the tonal generator is (16/15 10/9 9/8)<br/>     and the corresponding matrix S has, with the unison 1, this set<br/>     of modal srutis {81/80, 80/81, 25/24, 24/25, 135/128, 128/135}.</p><p>(5) Now, global explanation about the isomorphism G/2S --&gt; Z/n. If G/2 has<br/>the gammoid structure, then there exist a unique epimorphism F of G/2 on<br/>Z/n where ker(F) = {1}, meaning unison class is reduced to {1}. This<br/>epimorphism is decomposable like that</p><p>    G/2 --&gt; G/2S --&gt; Z/n</p><p>where there are a canonical epimorphism of tones G/2 on tone classes G/2S<br/>and an isomorphism of tone classes G/2S on the cyclic group Z/n.</p><p>(6) It is very strange for me that nobody seems to have remarked how the<br/>group Z/7 has modeled the western music and notation. Is it for III + III =<br/>V hides the underlying 2 + 2 = 4?</p><p>(7) As APPENDICE at this answer I list the three first gammiers (and more)<br/>having partition in degrees between 5 and 12.</p><p>RANK  GENERATOR             ONE EXAMPLE AMONG PROPER MODES</p><p>                [5 DEGREES]</p><p>  1  (1 3 5 9)              1 9/8 5/4 3/2 5/3 2            Chinese<br/>  2  (1 3 7 9)              1 8/7 9/7 3/2 7/4 2            Slendro<br/>  3  (1 3 9 11)             1 12/11 4/3 3/2 18/11 2        Pelog<br/> ------------------------------------------------------------------<br/> ??

I would like<br/>to end this last message by two such challenging questions on Hexany and<br/>Blues scale. Since I leave, I not intend to give solutions. Thus why asking<br/>these questions?</p><p>I was here to write about solutions, but maybe need for solutions is less<br/>important than need for questions. Giving solutions may be like giving<br/>fishes while giving question may be like giving a fishing rod.</p><p>-----On Hexany-----</p><p>Let be a diamond generated by (a b c d) where the letters can be (1 3 5 7)<br/>to facilitate the understanding. We can represent this matrix in 3D space<br/>by a symmetric figure where 1/1 is the center of a sphere and all other<br/>ratios are on the surface. If we delete 1/1 and trace an arc between all<br/>ratios being on same horizontal or vertical lines in the matrix then we<br/>have what I name a &quot;peripheral accordance graph&quot; for the structure<br/>generated by (a b c d) as chord. (What is deleted with 1/1 is &quot;neutral<br/>accordance graph&quot;.)</p><p>If you want to know easily how appears the spatial distribution of the<br/>ratios, try to arrange symmetricaly (in 3D) four identical circles around<br/>the same center. The 12 points where circles are crossing two by two<br/>correspond to positions of ratios and all parts of circles between these<br/>points correspond to vertices between ratios defined by lines and columns<br/>in the matrix.</p><p>Now, in figure with vertices as lines, we find, in the spatial surface, 8<br/>triangles and 6 squares. The 8 triangles correspond to the 8 chordic<br/>sub-generators of 3 elements. With (1 3 5 7) we have (1 3 5) (1 3 7) (1 5<br/>7) (3 5 7) in both harmonic and dual &quot;flavor&quot;.</p><p>What little geometric transformation (keeping triangles but cutting edges)<br/>of this structure may result precisely to hexany figure?</p><p>[Hint : in the transformation, the six peripheric triangles (chords) are<br/>changing their &quot;flavor&quot;]</p><p>More generally, what underlying (musical) sense of CPS may be suggested here?</p><p>What are the two distinct ordered structures used in all CPS design? In<br/>what distinct musical spaces these ordered structures have sense?</p><p>-----On the Blues scale-----</p><p>Find (v w x y z) the minimal odd generator of the Blues scale</p><p>    1 7/6 4/3 7/5 3/2 7/4 2</p><p>corresponding to the gammier 89.
