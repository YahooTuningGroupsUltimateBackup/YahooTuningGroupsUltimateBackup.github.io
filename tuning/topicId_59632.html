In fact, JS&apos;s uncle Johann<br/>Christoph Bach&apos;s oldest son publicly rebuked Neidhardt&apos;s unmusical tuning, reputed<br/>to have been equal temperament.  As a result, Neidhardt comes up with some<br/>new tunings and some switching around of Roman numerals that designate them.<br/>Too much activity too late...and not for J.S.

And yet, it is the possible of plurality that keeps a<br/>commitment of Bach in an authentic tuning from being taken seriously.  Brad Lehman has<br/>just added new layers.</p><p>Even if the organ was an original reason for Werckmeister III tuning,<br/>keyboards for Bach needed to be in a like tuning.

Too much activity too late...and not for J.S. Bach,<br/>&gt; like keeping his tuning from his strong familial training.</p><p>I fail to see your point here. The fact is we don&apos;t know directly what J.S.<br/>Bach preferred, only what his students have said. None of them said he used<br/>Werckmeister conclusively, so my only argument is that if you are arguing for<br/>Werckmeister based on historical considerations, there is more indirect<br/>evidence for the others (Neidhardt, Sorge, Silbermann, Bach&apos;s own tuning).</p><p>&gt; Marpurg and Sorge also published tunings from that era. Sorge published his<br/>&gt; tunings after Bach&apos;s death, but only the die-hard doubter would question<br/>&gt; the connection to Bach--they were both members of the same music society.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here I agree.  And yet, it is the possible of plurality that keeps a<br/>&gt; commitment of Bach in an authentic tuning from being taken seriously.  Brad<br/>&gt; Lehman has just added new layers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even if the organ was an original reason for Werckmeister III tuning,<br/>&gt; keyboards for Bach needed to be in a like tuning.  Both Werckmeister III<br/>&gt; and Bach&apos;s tuning are reportedly tuned in 15 minutes.  Neidhardt needs a<br/>&gt; monochord, no?</p><p>Clearly, again, you don&apos;t know the temperament I&apos;m referring to: Neidhardt I,<br/>a very simple temperament, actually. Look it up. Play with it and tell me it<br/>isn&apos;t beautiful.</p><p>It&apos;s obvious that you haven&apos;t even tuned up Bradley Lehman&apos;s reconstructed<br/>temperament, or Neidhardt, or Sorge, etc., because you wouldn&apos;t be so<br/>narrow-minded if you had. You are arguing from a purely &apos;on-paper&apos; point of<br/>view. Plus, you are clearly attached to Werck III because you seemed to have<br/>gone ahead and made it the default Bach tuning of the AFFM, which I think<br/>would be, um, a bit hasty.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Besides, many people publish tuning solutions well after they are used for<br/>&gt; years in practice. This same reason can be applied to Neidhardt for Bach<br/>&gt; for Bach&apos;s pre-1724 music. In fact since Neidhardt published his first<br/>&gt; writing in 1706, and was known to Bach, it stands to reason that his whole<br/>&gt; tuning ethos in general (since he never uses more than four pure fifths)<br/>&gt; serves as a healthy alternative to Werckmeister III.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Until you can arrange for a Brandenburg Concerto in Neidhardt tuning(s), I<br/>&gt; think you are not as healthy in your analysis as you hope to be.</p><p>I see--you consider your argument correct because you set up a public<br/>performance. I&apos;m glad you have a successful series. Kudos to you! But I<br/>hardly find it relevant, and it&apos;s an insufficient argument. Not only that, we<br/>are talking about keyboard instruments here, ensembles will anchor to the<br/>keyboard but imperfectly anyway.</p><p>I&apos;ve played enough of Bach&apos;s music in Neidhardt I (one of many that will<br/>work--I&apos;m not meaning to suggest that this is *the* solution in the same way<br/>you suggest Werck III is the obvious choice) to be convinced that it works<br/>beautifully. If you don&apos;t want to consider all of what the evidence suggests<br/>with more weight, your loss.;) And the evidence suggests nothing<br/>conclusively, I might add.</p><p>&gt; Sorry to disagree, not meaning to be disagreeable, certainly in tone.  It&apos;s<br/>&gt; just these general comments proporting to a done deal that JS Bach is not<br/>&gt; in Werckmeister III need to be confronted.</p><p>As much as &quot;Done deal....JS Bach is in Werckmeister III&quot; should be confronted!<br/>You clearly haven&apos;t considered *all* the available evidence, for if you did,<br/>you wouldn&apos;t conclude that Bach considered Werck III his default harpsichord<br/>tuning. In fact, the evidence is so against that possibility (he tended to<br/>use Silbermann on organs, and *not one* mention by a student suggesting J.S.<br/>used Werck III on harpsichords, and *at least one* mention by a student that<br/>it was a rather humble tuning, as well as the fact that all over Europe, the<br/>common practice was to have different variants on a &apos;modified meantone&apos; idea,<br/>not a quick 1/4-pythagorean comma solution that Werck III is, *and*, you<br/>completely ignore Silbermann, Sorge, Marpurg, Neidhardt, the possibility of<br/>Bach&apos;s own tuning) that I&apos;m surprised that you have centered you performances<br/>on this, claiming with authority that it is so. It&apos;s too bad, because if you<br/>suggested as such in your program notes, you were really being misleading.</p><p>Maybe you should explore the many other possibilities (and not just Neidhardt)<br/>with your resources before committing to the idea that Werck III is the best<br/>or most obvious choice for Bach&apos;s more chromatic offerings.</p><p>Anyway, no hard feelings, and I did enjoy, and buy your arguments, for the<br/>Ives!</p><p>-Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=59643 href="#59643">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>8/15/2005 5:43:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 8/15/2005 7:42:32 PM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:aaron@akjmusic.com">aaron@akjmusic.com</a> writes:<br/>All the evidence is against this idea.

CPE was describing his tuning, not his father&apos;s.  Even Kirnberger<br/>&gt; described his own tuning rather than that of JS Bach&apos;s, even while<br/>&gt; proposing to be propogating JS Bach&apos;s full philosophy of music.</p><p>Nope. CPE Bach was describing his family&apos;s tuning. He was a preserver of his<br/>father&apos;s line, in spite of his practice of a newer Galant style, he kept up<br/>the &apos;Stilo Antico&apos; thinking, and his family tradition. Kirnberger is right<br/>out, as Marpurg thought Kirnberger an inept tuning theorist. And Mizler, a<br/>Bach pupil, praised Neidhardt for instance over Werckmeister.</p><p>Let us recheck this.  C. Ph. E. Bach wrote in 1753 that the keyboard was to<br/>be tuned by &lsquo;taking away from most of the fifths a barely noticeable amount of<br/>their absolute purity&rsquo; so that the keyboards play equally in tune in all<br/>twenty-four tonalities&quot;<br/>but it was about what he thought about music.  There is no reference here to<br/>his father.</p><p>And CPE thought Marpurg was &quot;detestable&quot; in the way he treated Kirnberger.</p><p>Appealing to character assasination is a poor resource.  Mizler was quite the<br/>amateur and quite after the fact regarding Bach&apos;s tuning.  Besides, Mizler<br/>was friends with Neidhardt and had never met Werckmeister.</p><p>There is nothing ever anywhere to suggest that Werck-III was a<br/>common-practice<br/>tuning for anything other than organs. If that were true, there wouldn&apos;t be<br/>these tuning contests and such, for what beginner can&apos;t set Werckmesiter III<br/>quite accurately? Everything about J.S. Bach indicates that he would have<br/>favored a more sophisticated temperament for his music, and everything about<br/>his students and contemporaries indicates that they thought Kirnberger and<br/>Werckmeister were simple-minded, unsophisticated temperaments.</p><p>Here I think I would respond that Werckmeister was a pioneer.  History had<br/>treated him shabilly and so it continues.  However, I think that the organ<br/>origin of the Werckmeister III is a natural as an ideal for the harpsichord.  The<br/>lack of anything other than Neidhardt in describing temperament shows a common<br/>practice that was little described.  This is indeed the situation with 6th<br/>comma meantone, in practice with little discussion in print.</p><p>And, we know Bach used Silbermann 1/6 comma temperament, at least on organs,<br/>at one point, not even using Werckmeister III on organs, a fact that you seem<br/>to be unaware of, or ignoring.</p><p>This is simply not true.  &quot;We&quot; do not know any such thing.  Bach made fun of<br/>Silbermann&apos;s 1/6 comma temperament when he would make unannounced visits at<br/>the showroom.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Brad Lehman&apos;s argument in his reconstruction of Bach&apos;s temperament is very<br/>&gt; convincing, at least more so than any others tha have been done. I will say<br/>&gt; that I think he goes far in saying that this is the only temperament the<br/>&gt; Bach&apos;s music &apos;works&apos; in, although I understand his excitement about his<br/>&gt; discovery.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nope.  After having read both of Brad&apos;s articles, I am struck that Early<br/>&gt; Music would publish it at all, and with peer review, and in two parts.  I<br/>&gt; have already read the letters to the editor, and I have earlier posted<br/>&gt; after reading the first article.  The second installment offered nothing<br/>&gt; new, mostly rehash of the first article.  What Lehman &quot;discovered&quot; was a<br/>&gt; conveneience, a way of force-fitting a tuning from a wild interpretation of<br/>&gt; a single page of music&apos;s graphic noodling.  And with a suggestion to read<br/>&gt; it upside down, drawing wild conclusions upon the wiggles, and then to<br/>&gt; consider it as an audition for his Leipzig job with a coded set of<br/>&gt; direction for tuning its contents.  Please.</p><p>To each his own...the Leipzig connections, I admit, is a stretch. But c&apos;mon,<br/>11 squiggles? It seems highly unlikely that that was by chance, especially<br/>given the beat rates align to produce a compelling temperament. If it&apos;s a<br/>fluke, it&apos;s a miracle of a fluke.</p><p>That should have been the title, &quot;Miracle of a Fluke.&quot;  This was typical<br/>decoration.</p><p>&gt; Regardless, Bach &apos;works in&apos; 12tET and will work in Just (Ezra Sims), and<br/>&gt; will work in Lehman I.  The point is not that Bach works in different<br/>&gt; tunings.</p><p>Bach&apos;s music is clearly designed for temperament, not JI. And clearly it<br/>works, and is moving, in many different temperaments. (Even so, aren&apos;t you<br/>contradicting yourself when you say that some tuning &apos;bring out the<br/>counterpoint&apos; better than others? (your claim, not mine))</p><p>It is the genius of Bach that he works in every single tuning I have ever<br/>heard used.  But &quot;works&quot; is a very loose term, much like &quot;interesting&quot; for<br/>describing visual art.  And yet, JI Bach is limp.  The wrong temperament for Bach<br/>has got to be worse than the use of a right one.  That is why this is such a<br/>burning question.</p><p>&gt; JS Bach grew up in a melieu that was discovering chromatic organ playing.<br/>&gt; Wohl-temperirt (Well-temperament) is a Werckmeister anchor to Bach.<br/>&gt; The families were practically neighbors.  My ears demonstrates that JS Bach<br/>&gt; is in a great relationship to Werckmeister III tuning in musical<br/>&gt; performance.</p><p>I used to live next door to gangsta rappers, does that make me a gangsta<br/>rapper practitioner?</p><p>No, but it might mean that you have read, and accept, one of the typical<br/>spins on Bach, and have enjoyed playing in different tunings that are recommended.<br/> Hey, that&apos;s just fine, in its subjectivity.  Only, I do not prefer to accept<br/>these sources at face value.</p><p>&gt; Please listen to the CD for yourselves.  Some of it can be heard on the CD<br/>&gt; Baby website.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Please listen to this if you have a chance.  Go to <a href="http://www.afmm.org">www.afmm.org</a><br/>and follow the Early CD directions to CD Baby and give it a listen.  Pretty<br/>please?</p><p>That would be Neidhardt IV, not Neidhardt I, which is extremely easy to set.<br/>The contest was to see who could set mathematical equal temperament.</p><p>Nope, Neidhardt &quot;used&quot; a monochord for the competition.  And Bach won for<br/>being more &quot;singable&quot; which would possibly please Carl listening to Gould in<br/>12tET, but would sound like a vanilla-world of sound to me without any of the<br/>compelling intervallic tensions.</p><p>Neidhardt&apos;s was more accurate,</p><p>I never heard this rendition before.  Baloney.<br/>but judged &apos;less musical&apos; than the Bach<br/>tuning, which was easier for the singer(s).

At least that&apos;s what I see all the time.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And, we know Bach used Silbermann 1/6 comma temperament, at least on<br/>&gt; &gt; organs, at one point, not even using Werckmeister III on organs, a fact<br/>&gt; &gt; that you seem to be unaware of, or ignoring.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is simply not true.  &quot;We&quot; do not know any such thing.  Bach made fun<br/>&gt; of Silbermann&apos;s 1/6 comma temperament when he would make unannounced visits<br/>&gt; at the showroom.</p><p>Perhaps all in good fun? They were friendly. The story goes that he would just<br/>be obnoxious and play an Ab chord. Hardly evidence that he hated the tuning.<br/>We *today* love meantone, and still point out the wolves to people, because<br/>they are fun and obnoxious.</p><p>Even so, the story of Bach playing on an organ tuned to Silbermann&apos;s<br/>temperament points to the fact that Werck III was hardly even the universal<br/>*organ* tuning it is touted to be.</p><p>The evidence, I repeat, points to multiple possible well-temperaments and/or<br/>modified meantones.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I used to live next door to gangsta rappers, does that make me a gangsta<br/>&gt; &gt; rapper practitioner?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; No, but it might mean that you have read, and accept, one of the typical<br/>&gt; spins on Bach, and have enjoyed playing in different tunings that are<br/>&gt; recommended. Hey, that&apos;s just fine, in its subjectivity.  Only, I do not<br/>&gt; prefer to accept these sources at face value.</p><p>Well, time will tell....tune up one of the alternatives yourself. They really<br/>are quite beautiful in their own right.</p><p>&gt; &gt; That would be Neidhardt IV, not Neidhardt I, which is extremely easy to<br/>&gt; &gt; set. The contest was to see who could set mathematical equal temperament.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Nope, Neidhardt &quot;used&quot; a monochord for the competition.  And Bach won for<br/>&gt; being more &quot;singable&quot; which would possibly please Carl listening to Gould<br/>&gt; in 12tET, but would sound like a vanilla-world of sound to me without any<br/>&gt; of the compelling intervallic tensions.</p><p>Yes, Neidhardt was more accurate *because* he used a monochord. But he was<br/>tuning 12-equal (Nedihardt IV---not Neidhardt I) (How many times do I have to<br/>repeat that? ;))</p><p>&gt;  As a result, Neidhardt<br/>&gt; comes up with some new tunings and some switching around of Roman<br/>&gt; numerals that designate them.</p><p>You are attributing to Neidhardt a behavior we can hardly objectively<br/>speculate about. In his published scheme, my understanding is that they<br/>represent a graduation into 12-equal from village (I) to town (II) to city<br/>(III) to court (IV). You seem to be stubbornly resistant to trying it, to say<br/>the least! Try them out, pretty please? You don&apos;t need to try IV--it&apos;s the<br/>same as 12-equal.</p><p>&gt; Too much activity too late...and not for<br/>&gt; J.S. Bach, like keeping his tuning from his strong familial training.</p><p>And perhaps passing it on to his son, CPE, who describes most of the fifths as<br/>tempered....how could you think J.S. was so traditional and his son was not.<br/>What are your reasons?</p><p>&gt; &gt;I fail to see your point here. The fact is we don&apos;t know directly what J.S.<br/>&gt; &gt; Bach preferred, only what his students have said.</p><p>&gt; We know what was the tradition in that part of the world.  The circular use<br/>&gt; of music was introduced into Thuringia by Werckmeister regardless of what<br/>&gt; Bach&apos;s students may or may not say.</p><p>A general question: what evidence would you admit, if not the circumstantial<br/>direct quotes of his son, and his students, and his cirlce of contemporaries,<br/>none of whom even indirectly suggest Werck III to be his tuning of choice?</p><p>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s obvious that you haven&apos;t even tuned up Bradley Lehman&apos;s reconstructed<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some harpsichordists told me they do not like it, and some are reputed to<br/>&gt; like it.  While I have not tuned up a harpsichord in it, it useability for<br/>&gt; Bach means too little for its obvious subjectivity.</p><p>Well, shouldn&apos;t you judge for yourself?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would consider doing a Brandenburg in Neidhardt I, do you think this<br/>&gt; would be appropriate?</p><p>I like Neidhardt I. I don&apos;t want to beat it to death, though. There are<br/>others. But, I would applaud your desire to experiment a bit and see which<br/>other ones compel you and why. It&apos;s art after all, not hard science ;)</p><p>You might find it nice not to be in such a Werckmeister-box!</p><p>I&apos;ll tell you what---let&apos;s do an experiment. I&apos;ll prepare some mp3&apos;s of a Bach<br/>prelude of your choice from WTC in a number of temperaments of your choice<br/>(we might start with Werckmeister III, Sorge, Silbermann, Neidhardt, some<br/>Marpurg, Lehman I) and we can see what people respond to and why. There are<br/>no &apos;right answers&apos; here. Just different beauties. ;)</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If your pruport to think sound important, why wouldn&apos;t large ensemble<br/>&gt; useage of Werckmeister III and sixth comma tuning and Kirnberger II tuning,<br/>&gt; etc., on the highest professional level be akin to &quot;hasty&quot;?  It is not a<br/>&gt; &quot;paper&quot; issue at all.</p><p>No, I don&apos;t mean to say that what you did was &apos;wrong&apos;...only that there are<br/>other things to explore before picking a pet temperament. We might even say<br/>&quot;who cares what history says, I like this for these qualities&quot; or something.<br/>It&apos;s *art* after all. But by your own admission, you&apos;ve not explored the<br/>other possibles with your group, and it would be a real study to do so, no? I<br/>would take a musician of your calibre seriously who has said &quot;I tried this<br/>this this and this, and I prefer this most of all, here&apos;s why....the hhistory<br/>books are almost moot with a strong aesthetic preference like that. If at the<br/>end of the day, Werck III is still your doll, so be it. You won&apos;t been any<br/>worse of having tasted the others!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Besides, many people publish tuning solutions well after they are used<br/>&gt; &gt; for years in practice. This same reason can be applied to Neidhardt for<br/>&gt; &gt; Bach for Bach&apos;s pre-1724 music. In fact since Neidhardt published his<br/>&gt; &gt; first writing in 1706, and was known to Bach, it stands to reason that<br/>&gt; &gt; his whole tuning ethos in general (since he never uses more than four<br/>&gt; &gt; pure fifths) serves as a healthy alternative to Werckmeister III.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Until you can arrange for a Brandenburg Concerto in Neidhardt tuning(s),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you are not as healthy in your analysis as you hope to be.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I see--you consider your argument correct because you set up a public<br/>&gt; &gt; performance. I&apos;m glad you have a successful series. Kudos to you! But I<br/>&gt; &gt; hardly find it relevant, and it&apos;s an insufficient argument. Not only that,<br/>&gt; &gt; we are talking about keyboard instruments here, ensembles will anchor to<br/>&gt; &gt; the keyboard but imperfectly anyway.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Alas, this is a prejudice, Aaron.  Ensembles anchor better when the tuning<br/>&gt; is clearly set and understood.  Why not listen to our results?</p><p>I&apos;ll have to do just that!</p><p>&gt; You have<br/>&gt; nothing to lose.  Maybe you&apos;ll simply find that it is a good performance<br/>&gt; and leave it at that.  Sloppy keyboard tuning surely cannot increase the<br/>&gt; tuning accuracy of the non-vibrato playing ensemblers.</p><p>Well, no tuning that we&apos;re talking about here would be &apos;sloppy&apos;.</p><p>&lt;snipped stuff&gt;</p><p>&gt; When Kirnberger, Bach&apos;s most famous theory student, tried to trump Bach&apos;s<br/>&gt; tuning with his own it means Bach could have used any unequal well<br/>&gt; temperament.</p><p>Right, several of which you haven&apos;t tried! The &apos;proof&apos; ought to be in the<br/>compelling sound of it, methinks.</p><p>&gt; I have not committed anything to print as absolute, yet.  That&apos;s why I like<br/>&gt; working these things out over the web.  Really, though, while I will gladly<br/>&gt; familiarize with different tunings one at a time, history is clearly on the<br/>&gt; side of Werckmeister III as a likely Bach tuning for most all of his music.</p><p>Well, just keep an open mind about it, as I will, too. Tune up some of the<br/>others!</p><p>While we&apos;re discussing this, I came up with my own interpretation of Neidhardt<br/>I which I quite like:</p><p>Starting at C, do pure C-F-Bb-Eb-A; you have a resulting ascending C-Ab sixth.<br/>We&apos;ll divide that up into two equal beating thirds. So, make C-E beat equal<br/>to E-G#. Now we have a ascending minor sixth E-C that we will repeat the<br/>procedure to, to soften the Ab-C Pythagorean third a bit: so bring G# up a<br/>bit so that E-G# now beats equal to G#-C. (of course, it will no longer beat<br/>equal with C-E). This layout ultimately favors slightly the flat keys in<br/>terms of consonance, because of the equal beating step.</p><p>Neidhardt I has C-F-Bb as pure fifths/fourths, so we&apos;ll keep that from the<br/>beginning. These are followed by two slightly impure fifths.</p><p>So next we retune Eb-Bb ascending fifth to be the same size (a la meantone) as<br/>the ascending fifth Ab-Eb.</p><p>The E-G# is divided analogously to Ab-C; two pure, then two impure fifths.</p><p>So then we have and G#-C# pure descending fifth<br/>     Then C#-F# pure ascending fourth<br/>     F#-B descending fifth same size as B-E descending fifth.</p><p>Finally, we then distribute C-E a la meantone between C-G-D-A-E.</p><p>A nice, subtle well temperament, the distant key signatures not too harsh, and<br/>it&apos;s easily done. And it has a large number of subtly, differently-sized<br/>intervals, if you like maximully distinct counterpoint! ;)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=59647 href="#59647">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>8/16/2005 6:36:56 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In a message dated 8/16/2005 1:22:01 AM Eastern Standard Time,<br/><a href="mailto:aaron@akjmusic.com">aaron@akjmusic.com</a> writes:<br/>&gt; Marpurg was an ingracous ass.  And Kirnberger achieved the most subtle well<br/>&gt; temperament of his time.  What are you talking about here?</p><p>The first statement is ad hominem, the second is an opinion *not* shared by<br/>many of Bach&apos;s own contemporaries.</p><p>JR: Hi all.  Wellcome to round 3 in this friendly look under rocks and &quot;tuner<br/>fishing.&quot;</p><p>Marpurg was an ingracious ass because he got his job in the Berlin library<br/>through the good services of Kirnberger, only to turn upon his benefactor<br/>viciously.</p><p>As for &quot;subtle&quot; I thought you meant, Aaron, that the keys were not that<br/>noticeably different from each other.  In Kirnberger they are not distinctive,<br/>being Just mainly, and Werckmeister is has the opposite, clear gradations between<br/>keys.</p><p>&gt; &gt; You forget all the modified meantones of Europe, more of a common practice<br/>&gt; &gt; than Werck III for sure...plus we should really point out that it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; possible that the temperament for WTC might have been different than what<br/>&gt; &gt; Bach used for common practice meantone-derived music. The Art of Fugue<br/>&gt; &gt; works in Silbermann&apos;s temperament, for sure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Studies from Barbuor to Lindley conclude that Bach requires a 12-note per<br/>&gt; octave well temperament, not a modified meantone, for the great majority of<br/>&gt; his organ compositions.</p><p>A modified meantone *can* be a well-temperament, if it&apos;s a high enough<br/>fractional comma value to allow perfect fifths in the remoter keys. I suppose<br/>this is all semantics, dependant upon how one defines a well-temperament,<br/>though.</p><p>JR: While keyboard players think this is all about keyboard tuning (some<br/>thinking there is a segregation between organ and keyboard, let alone clavichord),<br/>ALL INSTRUMENTS in Bach play with those keyboards.  And there are organs in<br/>St. Matthew&apos;s Passion, et al. by Bach.  Slight modifications to meantone have<br/>no bearing for the need of only 12 notes to express all of music.  Extended<br/>meantone is a great game plan for a later age, when the keyboad is no longer<br/>REQUIRED for every instrumental ensemble.  A neat, understandable game plan for<br/>intonation is incumbant for the players to be accurate.  That is what<br/>Werckmeister III was, the plan that was on the table for all the musicians playing.  The<br/>miricle was that with only 12 notes one could truly master the art of<br/>temperament.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (Johnny said): In<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; other worlds, the ability for contrapuntal lines to stand out would be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; best served by less subtlety.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The clarity of contrapuntal aspect has nothing to do with the tuning, as<br/>&gt; &gt; far as I can hear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Then there is more to be heard.  Akin to the reason for rules about<br/>&gt; avoiding parallel fifths and for not having crossing voices, there is<br/>&gt; indeed a separation of melodic lines.  Werckmeister III gives greater<br/>&gt; definition between melodic lines due to its lack of subtlety, unless we are<br/>&gt; talking about a different sense of subtlety.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure I follow. How could 7 pure fifths by your argument, lead to<br/>greater definition. Wouldn&apos;t a greater diversity of fifths support that<br/>argument better?<br/>Having only 2 sizes of fifths, pure and 1/4 comma flate (6 cents apart) makes<br/>it possible for non-keyboard players to negotiate between them rather easily.<br/> One gets a 12 note &quot;special&quot; blues scale.  IF you have so much diversity,<br/>let&apos;s say every fifth is a different size, then players will indeed be<br/>out-of-tune because they won&apos;t be on the same page.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Let us recheck this.  C. Ph. E. Bach wrote in 1753 that the keyboard was to<br/>&gt; be tuned by &lsquo;taking away from most of the fifths a barely noticeable amount<br/>&gt; of their absolute purity&rsquo; so that the keyboards play equally in tune in all<br/>&gt; twenty-four tonalities&quot;<br/>&gt; but it was about what he thought about music.  There is no reference here<br/>&gt; to his father.</p><p>And no reference to Werckmeister, either. And why would Bach&apos;s son&apos;s tuning<br/>not be of the same tradition as his father. If it were, it would be<br/>mentioned. He would have said &quot;In an older style, so and so was done to a few<br/>fifths, now we temper more of them&quot; or something.</p><p>JR: He did change, and he said so, that is C.P.E.  Johann Christian changed,<br/>too.  Probably, W.F did not, preferring meantone.</p><p>The reason the tuning changed is because music changed.  As music went<br/>vertical from its horizontal basis of layered melodies, greater consonance was<br/>needed than Werckmeister tuning.  It was the flute-playing King&apos;s style, a melody<br/>floating of chords.  This was the new Classical era, probably actually begining<br/>10 years BEFORE Bach died.  The German world was waiting for his death so<br/>that the old-fashioned Baroque could end.</p><p>This is why the tuning was not left to that used by the father, JS.  BTW,<br/>ever hear of family jealousies?  That was the Bach&apos;s and Werckmeister.  They just<br/>didn&apos;t talk about each other, although both families KNEW of each other quite<br/>well.  Each was an exemplor of music at the same time in a very small area of<br/>northwestern Thuringia to include the Harz mountains.</p><p>I&apos;m not convinced.</p><p>&gt; And CPE thought Marpurg was &quot;detestable&quot; in the way he treated Kirnberger.</p><p>It doesn&apos;t mean he didn&apos;t agree about the temperament, though.</p><p>Ever hear or play Marpurg?  I bought a CD of Marpurg&apos;s music.  Although it<br/>mentions the exact tuning that Marpurg wanted for his pieces, the pianist chose<br/>to do them in ET because he thought Marpurg&apos;s tuning was detestable.</p><p>&gt; This is simply not true.  &quot;We&quot; do not know any such thing.  Bach made fun<br/>&gt; of Silbermann&apos;s 1/6 comma temperament when he would make unannounced visits<br/>&gt; at the showroom.</p><p>Perhaps all in good fun? They were friendly. The story goes that he would<br/>just<br/>be obnoxious and play an Ab chord. Hardly evidence that he hated the tuning.<br/>We *today* love meantone, and still point out the wolves to people, because<br/>they are fun and obnoxious.</p><p>Sorry, but you are reaching.  Why play the obnoxious Ab chord to embarras a<br/>friend if he used the same Ab chord for his tuning?  You might as well say the<br/>tortoise is faster than the hare.<br/>Yes, Neidhardt was more accurate *because* he used a monochord. But he was<br/>tuning 12-equal (Nedihardt IV---not Neidhardt I) (How many times do I have to<br/>repeat that? ;))</p><p>JR: Doesn&apos;t that contradict your previous assertion that the &quot;idea&quot; for the<br/>contest was to tune 12-equal?  Using a monochord, Neidhardt should have won.<br/>It was not about equalness.  I know this in my gut.  I know this from many<br/>visits to the cities Bach lived in, all architecturally rich in non-equalness:<br/>including but not limited to door shapes, window shapes, stones in the street<br/>shapes, heights of stairs (and directions, many curving) differ leading up to<br/>churches, etc.</p><p>&gt;  As a result, Neidhardt<br/>&gt; comes up with some new tunings and some switching around of Roman<br/>&gt; numerals that designate them.</p><p>You are attributing to Neidhardt a behavior we can hardly objectively<br/>speculate about.

Aaron, have you never heard of a<br/>generation gap?

It is understandable that<br/>no one knows his side of the story because his works have either not been<br/>translated out of German, and the little bit that has been &quot;interpreted&quot; is often<br/>from a stated bias (like pro-ET).  I have read all the works through with a<br/>native German of Wolfenbuttal (who was also a Ph.D. specialist in the German<br/>language of the area, and my elder) while visiting for research several years<br/>ago.  And that is only for starters.</p><p>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s obvious that you haven&apos;t even tuned up Bradley Lehman&apos;s reconstructed<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Some harpsichordists told me they do not like it, and some are reputed to<br/>&gt; like it.

It came with directing musicians in playing all<br/>manner of tunings. I already know what the different intervals sound like: ET,<br/>Just, sixth comma meantone, even different abstract cents combinations.  It is<br/>what I do.</p><p>&gt; I would consider doing a Brandenburg in Neidhardt I, do you think this<br/>&gt; would be appropriate?</p><p>I like Neidhardt I.

Now I am<br/>more interesting in producing the music.</p><p>Aaron: You might find it nice not to be in such a Werckmeister-box!</p><p>JR: This is a sarcastic argument at best.  The world know nothing about<br/>Werckmeister, not even a biography.  At least Kirnberger has been translated and<br/>and an image that has been passed down.  Werckmeister is for all intents and<br/>purposes, is invisible.</p><p>Aaron: I&apos;ll tell you what---let&apos;s do an experiment. I&apos;ll prepare some mp3&apos;s<br/>of a Bach<br/>prelude of your choice from WTC in a number of temperaments of your choice<br/>(we might start with Werckmeister III, Sorge, Silbermann, Neidhardt, some<br/>Marpurg, Lehman I) and we can see what people respond to and why. There are<br/>no &apos;right answers&apos; here. Just different beauties. ;)</p><p>JR: While I would applaud your industry in this endeavor, we are not talking<br/>about polls.  But it does help me understand why you chose this line of<br/>beliefs.  Honestly, people live with different beliefs (e.g., religions,<br/>non-religions, etc.).  But it would be wrong to think there is a &quot;Werckmeister religion.&quot;<br/> Gee, I am not even a fraction of the Christian he was, or Bach was.<br/>(Actually, not at all.) ;)</p><p>Aaron: No, I don&apos;t mean to say that what you did was &apos;wrong&apos;...only that<br/>there are<br/>other things to explore before picking a pet temperament.

In 25 years<br/>of concertizing exclusively microtonal shows I decided never to allow certain<br/>things.  The music had to be great music foremost and there would only be<br/>music that would be resplendent.  Yes, there are expermiments, most out of<br/>hearing of the audience.  Before you go on about what I haven&apos;t heard any further,<br/>you should perhaps consider what I have heard, and ellicit.  But you are right<br/>to present modern music any way you like.  And you can distort earlier music<br/>into 7ET if you like.</p><p>Aaron: While we&apos;re discussing this, I came up with my own interpretation of<br/>Neidhardt<br/>I which I quite like:</p><p>JR:  I am glad you are using your research in new works.  It is terrific.<br/>However, Neidhardt doesn&apos;t make sense as Bach&apos;s tuning.

And Kirnberger achieved the most subtle<br/>&gt; &gt; well temperament of his time.  What are you talking about here?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first statement is ad hominem, the second is an opinion *not* shared by<br/>&gt; many of Bach&apos;s own contemporaries.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR: Hi all.  Wellcome to round 3 in this friendly look under rocks and<br/>&gt; &quot;tuner fishing.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Marpurg was an ingracious ass because he got his job in the Berlin library<br/>&gt; through the good services of Kirnberger, only to turn upon his benefactor<br/>&gt; viciously.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As for &quot;subtle&quot; I thought you meant, Aaron, that the keys were not that<br/>&gt; noticeably different from each other.  In Kirnberger they are not<br/>&gt; distinctive, being Just mainly, and Werckmeister is has the opposite, clear<br/>&gt; gradations between keys.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; You forget all the modified meantones of Europe, more of a common<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; practice than Werck III for sure...plus we should really point out that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it&apos;s possible that the temperament for WTC might have been different<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; than what Bach used for common practice meantone-derived music. The Art<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of Fugue works in Silbermann&apos;s temperament, for sure.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Studies from Barbuor to Lindley conclude that Bach requires a 12-note per<br/>&gt; &gt; octave well temperament, not a modified meantone, for the great majority<br/>&gt; &gt; of his organ compositions.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A modified meantone *can* be a well-temperament, if it&apos;s a high enough<br/>&gt; fractional comma value to allow perfect fifths in the remoter keys. I<br/>&gt; suppose this is all semantics, dependant upon how one defines a<br/>&gt; well-temperament, though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR: While keyboard players think this is all about keyboard tuning (some<br/>&gt; thinking there is a segregation between organ and keyboard, let alone<br/>&gt; clavichord), ALL INSTRUMENTS in Bach play with those keyboards.  And there<br/>&gt; are organs in St. Matthew&apos;s Passion, et al. by Bach.  Slight modifications<br/>&gt; to meantone have no bearing for the need of only 12 notes to express all of<br/>&gt; music.  Extended meantone is a great game plan for a later age, when the<br/>&gt; keyboad is no longer REQUIRED for every instrumental ensemble.  A neat,<br/>&gt; understandable game plan for intonation is incumbant for the players to be<br/>&gt; accurate.  That is what Werckmeister III was, the plan that was on the<br/>&gt; table for all the musicians playing.  The miricle was that with only 12<br/>&gt; notes one could truly master the art of temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Johnny said): In<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other worlds, the ability for contrapuntal lines to stand out would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be best served by less subtlety.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The clarity of contrapuntal aspect has nothing to do with the tuning,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as far as I can hear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Then there is more to be heard.  Akin to the reason for rules about<br/>&gt; &gt; avoiding parallel fifths and for not having crossing voices, there is<br/>&gt; &gt; indeed a separation of melodic lines.  Werckmeister III gives greater<br/>&gt; &gt; definition between melodic lines due to its lack of subtlety, unless we<br/>&gt; &gt; are talking about a different sense of subtlety.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure I follow. How could 7 pure fifths by your argument, lead to<br/>&gt; greater definition. Wouldn&apos;t a greater diversity of fifths support that<br/>&gt; argument better?<br/>&gt; Having only 2 sizes of fifths, pure and 1/4 comma flate (6 cents apart)<br/>&gt; makes it possible for non-keyboard players to negotiate between them rather<br/>&gt; easily. One gets a 12 note &quot;special&quot; blues scale.  IF you have so much<br/>&gt; diversity, let&apos;s say every fifth is a different size, then players will<br/>&gt; indeed be out-of-tune because they won&apos;t be on the same page.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Let us recheck this.  C. Ph. E. Bach wrote in 1753 that the keyboard was<br/>&gt; &gt; to be tuned by &lsquo;taking away from most of the fifths a barely noticeable<br/>&gt; &gt; amount of their absolute purity&rsquo; so that the keyboards play equally in<br/>&gt; &gt; tune in all twenty-four tonalities&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; but it was about what he thought about music.  There is no reference here<br/>&gt; &gt; to his father.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And no reference to Werckmeister, either. And why would Bach&apos;s son&apos;s tuning<br/>&gt; not be of the same tradition as his father. If it were, it would be<br/>&gt; mentioned. He would have said &quot;In an older style, so and so was done to a<br/>&gt; few fifths, now we temper more of them&quot; or something.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR: He did change, and he said so, that is C.P.E.  Johann Christian<br/>&gt; changed, too.  Probably, W.F did not, preferring meantone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The reason the tuning changed is because music changed.  As music went<br/>&gt; vertical from its horizontal basis of layered melodies, greater consonance<br/>&gt; was needed than Werckmeister tuning.  It was the flute-playing King&apos;s<br/>&gt; style, a melody floating of chords.  This was the new Classical era,<br/>&gt; probably actually begining 10 years BEFORE Bach died.  The German world was<br/>&gt; waiting for his death so that the old-fashioned Baroque could end.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is why the tuning was not left to that used by the father, JS.  BTW,<br/>&gt; ever hear of family jealousies?  That was the Bach&apos;s and Werckmeister.<br/>&gt; They just didn&apos;t talk about each other, although both families KNEW of each<br/>&gt; other quite well.  Each was an exemplor of music at the same time in a very<br/>&gt; small area of northwestern Thuringia to include the Harz mountains.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not convinced.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And CPE thought Marpurg was &quot;detestable&quot; in the way he treated<br/>&gt; &gt; Kirnberger.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It doesn&apos;t mean he didn&apos;t agree about the temperament, though.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ever hear or play Marpurg?  I bought a CD of Marpurg&apos;s music.  Although it<br/>&gt; mentions the exact tuning that Marpurg wanted for his pieces, the pianist<br/>&gt; chose to do them in ET because he thought Marpurg&apos;s tuning was detestable.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is simply not true.  &quot;We&quot; do not know any such thing.  Bach made fun<br/>&gt; &gt; of Silbermann&apos;s 1/6 comma temperament when he would make unannounced<br/>&gt; &gt; visits at the showroom.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps all in good fun? They were friendly. The story goes that he would<br/>&gt; just<br/>&gt; be obnoxious and play an Ab chord. Hardly evidence that he hated the<br/>&gt; tuning. We *today* love meantone, and still point out the wolves to people,<br/>&gt; because they are fun and obnoxious.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry, but you are reaching.  Why play the obnoxious Ab chord to embarras a<br/>&gt; friend if he used the same Ab chord for his tuning?  You might as well say<br/>&gt; the tortoise is faster than the hare.<br/>&gt; Yes, Neidhardt was more accurate *because* he used a monochord. But he was<br/>&gt; tuning 12-equal (Nedihardt IV---not Neidhardt I) (How many times do I have<br/>&gt; to repeat that? ;))<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR: Doesn&apos;t that contradict your previous assertion that the &quot;idea&quot; for the<br/>&gt; contest was to tune 12-equal?  Using a monochord, Neidhardt should have<br/>&gt; won. It was not about equalness.  I know this in my gut.  I know this from<br/>&gt; many visits to the cities Bach lived in, all architecturally rich in<br/>&gt; non-equalness: including but not limited to door shapes, window shapes,<br/>&gt; stones in the street shapes, heights of stairs (and directions, many<br/>&gt; curving) differ leading up to churches, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  As a result, Neidhardt<br/>&gt; &gt; comes up with some new tunings and some switching around of Roman<br/>&gt; &gt; numerals that designate them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You are attributing to Neidhardt a behavior we can hardly objectively<br/>&gt; speculate about. In his published scheme, my understanding is that they<br/>&gt; represent a graduation into 12-equal from village (I) to town (II) to city<br/>&gt; (III) to court (IV). You seem to be stubbornly resistant to trying it, to<br/>&gt; say the least! Try them out, pretty please? You don&apos;t need to try IV--it&apos;s<br/>&gt; the same as 12-equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Too much activity too late...and not for<br/>&gt; &gt; J.S. Bach, like keeping his tuning from his strong familial training.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And perhaps passing it on to his son, CPE, who describes most of the fifths<br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; tempered....how could you think J.S. was so traditional and his son was<br/>&gt; not. What are your reasons?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR: Much is explained above in this post.  Aaron, have you never heard of a<br/>&gt; generation gap?  Didn&apos;t CPE move out and away ASAP to escape his father&apos;s<br/>&gt; power over him, musical and otherwise?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A general question: what evidence would you admit, if not the<br/>&gt; circumstantial direct quotes of his son, and his students, and his cirlce<br/>&gt; of contemporaries, none of whom even indirectly suggest Werck III to be his<br/>&gt; tuning of choice?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR: There is lots of evidence within the works of Werckmeister, a prolific<br/>&gt; writer and publisher, besides being a good musician.  It is understandable<br/>&gt; that no one knows his side of the story because his works have either not<br/>&gt; been translated out of German, and the little bit that has been<br/>&gt; &quot;interpreted&quot; is often from a stated bias (like pro-ET).  I have read all<br/>&gt; the works through with a native German of Wolfenbuttal (who was also a<br/>&gt; Ph.D. specialist in the German language of the area, and my elder) while<br/>&gt; visiting for research several years ago.  And that is only for starters.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It&apos;s obvious that you haven&apos;t even tuned up Bradley Lehman&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; reconstructed temperament,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Some harpsichordists told me they do not like it, and some are reputed to<br/>&gt; &gt; like it.  While I have not tuned up a harpsichord in it, it useability<br/>&gt; &gt; for Bach means too little for its obvious subjectivity.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, shouldn&apos;t you judge for yourself?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  Eventually I will hear it, but you know what, I have a good<br/>&gt; imagination with hearing microtones.  It came with directing musicians in<br/>&gt; playing all manner of tunings. I already know what the different intervals<br/>&gt; sound like: ET, Just, sixth comma meantone, even different abstract cents<br/>&gt; combinations.  It is what I do.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I would consider doing a Brandenburg in Neidhardt I, do you think this<br/>&gt; &gt; would be appropriate?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like Neidhardt I. I don&apos;t want to beat it to death, though. There are<br/>&gt; others. But, I would applaud your desire to experiment a bit and see which<br/>&gt; other ones compel you and why. It&apos;s art after all, not hard science ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  If for one momemnt I thought there was one note that didn&apos;t work<br/>&gt; perfectly for JS Bach in Werckmeister III then I would still be looking.<br/>&gt; Now I am more interesting in producing the music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron: You might find it nice not to be in such a Werckmeister-box!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR: This is a sarcastic argument at best.  The world know nothing about<br/>&gt; Werckmeister, not even a biography.  At least Kirnberger has been<br/>&gt; translated and and an image that has been passed down.  Werckmeister is for<br/>&gt; all intents and purposes, is invisible.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron: I&apos;ll tell you what---let&apos;s do an experiment. I&apos;ll prepare some mp3&apos;s<br/>&gt; of a Bach<br/>&gt; prelude of your choice from WTC in a number of temperaments of your choice<br/>&gt; (we might start with Werckmeister III, Sorge, Silbermann, Neidhardt, some<br/>&gt; Marpurg, Lehman I) and we can see what people respond to and why. There are<br/>&gt; no &apos;right answers&apos; here. Just different beauties. ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR: While I would applaud your industry in this endeavor, we are not<br/>&gt; talking about polls.  But it does help me understand why you chose this<br/>&gt; line of beliefs.  Honestly, people live with different beliefs (e.g.,<br/>&gt; religions, non-religions, etc.).  But it would be wrong to think there is a<br/>&gt; &quot;Werckmeister religion.&quot; Gee, I am not even a fraction of the Christian he<br/>&gt; was, or Bach was. (Actually, not at all.) ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron: No, I don&apos;t mean to say that what you did was &apos;wrong&apos;...only that<br/>&gt; there are<br/>&gt; other things to explore before picking a pet temperament. We might even say<br/>&gt; &quot;who cares what history says, I like this for these qualities&quot; or<br/>&gt; something. It&apos;s *art* after all. But by your own admission, you&apos;ve not<br/>&gt; explored the other possibles with your group, and it would be a real study<br/>&gt; to do so, no? I would take a musician of your calibre seriously who has<br/>&gt; said &quot;I tried this this this and this, and I prefer this most of all,<br/>&gt; here&apos;s why....the hhistory books are almost moot with a strong aesthetic<br/>&gt; preference like that. If at the end of the day, Werck III is still your<br/>&gt; doll, so be it. You won&apos;t been any worse of having tasted the others!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  Ah, now we are talking about philosophy in making concerts.  In 25<br/>&gt; years of concertizing exclusively microtonal shows I decided never to allow<br/>&gt; certain things.  The music had to be great music foremost and there would<br/>&gt; only be music that would be resplendent.  Yes, there are expermiments, most<br/>&gt; out of hearing of the audience.  Before you go on about what I haven&apos;t<br/>&gt; heard any further, you should perhaps consider what I have heard, and<br/>&gt; ellicit.  But you are right to present modern music any way you like.  And<br/>&gt; you can distort earlier music into 7ET if you like.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Aaron: While we&apos;re discussing this, I came up with my own interpretation of<br/>&gt; Neidhardt<br/>&gt; I which I quite like:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JR:  I am glad you are using your research in new works.  It is terrific.<br/>&gt; However, Neidhardt doesn&apos;t make sense as Bach&apos;s tuning.  JS had been using<br/>&gt; his tuning before a Jena-based student named Neidhardt had publicized his<br/>&gt; &quot;new&quot; Neidhardt I tuning (since the last one he made public was now to be<br/>&gt; relegated to IV).

I played through it tonight.</p><p>There were admirable things about Werck III in this piece, but problems as<br/>well. In general, I liked how some places produced micro-tension and release<br/>points in Werck III. For example, m.20, which starts with an Eb above middle<br/>C and C above middle C should be played slowly. It&apos;s not entirely without<br/>interesting and compelling qualities.</p><p>But, at the end of the day, I like my Bach to go down a little smoother. Werck<br/>III is too much of a rough and ready tuning for me.</p><p>Just a list of problems I encountered with Werck III in this Duetto:</p><p>1) your example of the first unfolded F major triad. It lacks energy and<br/>forward propulsion, for lack of a better description. Unfortunately for Werck<br/>III, this problem persists to my ear at *any* tempo, including fast tempi.<br/>The &apos;A&apos; in particular. I will say that, like meantone, the vertical chord of<br/>F is lovely in Werck III, but melodically, for a duet, leave a bit to be<br/>desired.<br/>2) Bar 3-the D leading melodically from the Bb to C to D, sounds sour and flat<br/>IMO. Again, the line loses upward flow/propulsion.<br/>3) Bars 10 and following, where there is imitation, have annoying open fifths<br/>that beat too much followed by rather static intervals, all in a haphazard<br/>way that defies the linear logic of the music, IMO. For instance, I don&apos;t<br/>care for the vertical coincidence at bar 11, 5 16th notes in, between tenor D<br/>and A above middle C. Caveat; this is all much more noticable at slow tempi.<br/>The effect is much more subtle at full speed, and much less bothersome.<br/>4) Listen to the statement at bar 17, with the arpeggiated left hand coming<br/>upwards in a C7 chord. The leading tone E into F seems dull in Werck III. And<br/>so does the arrival in Bar 18 of the D in the left hand (the one with the tie<br/>coming from it into the next bar). It lacks impetus.<br/>5) The F minor bit at bar 77 sounds rough and raucus and a bit of a throwback<br/>to meantone days.</p><p>There are more, but I&apos;ll let you all explore and find them!</p><p>And thanks for that tip, Brad.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>On Tuesday 16 August 2005 3:57 pm, Brad Lehman wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; JR:  If for one momemnt I thought there was one note that didn&apos;t<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; work<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; perfectly for JS Bach in Werckmeister III then I would still be<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; looking.

In chapter 10 the author starts his explanation as<br/>to why equal temperament should now be preferred, and he has a<br/>section on 98 where he lumps all &quot;Unequal Temperament&quot; together into<br/>a straw bin, explaining it briefly, on the way to tossing all of it<br/>into the rubbish.

Never mind the dumb<br/>dodos who just want to play piles of trash pop music in flats...what<br/>if that, right there, is an idiom where the vernacular reminds us<br/>what sounds good in practice, in music that is in flats *or* sharps?<br/>Mellow flats, bright/brilliant sharps, smoothly arranged in<br/>modulation around the spiral of 5ths from one key to the next, and<br/>centered on C.</p><p>Wasn&apos;t it Irving Berlin who played *everything* in deep flats?</p><p>Bradley Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=59680 href="#59680">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Krister Johnson &#x3C;aaron@akjmusic.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2005 7:50:21 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Wednesday 17 August 2005 9:09 am, <a href="mailto:Afmmjr@aol.com">Afmmjr@aol.com</a> wrote:</p><p>&gt; Right now I am sad that after producing great music by Bach that happens to<br/>&gt; be in Werckmeister III no one on this list thinks it important to listen<br/>&gt; to.</p><p>Johnny, I hope you didn&apos;t read my challenges to your position re:Werckmeister<br/>as an utter dissmissal of your very important work!

Author J<br/>&gt; Cree Fischer.  Original publication Theo Presser 1907, available now<br/>&gt; as Dover reprint.  In chapter 10 the author starts his explanation as<br/>&gt; to why equal temperament should now be preferred, and he has a<br/>&gt; section on 98 where he lumps all &quot;Unequal Temperament&quot; together into<br/>&gt; a straw bin, explaining it briefly, on the way to tossing all of it<br/>&gt; into the rubbish.  But here&apos;s the part that intrigues me:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;In this day, when piano and organ music is written and played in all<br/>&gt; the keys, the unequal temperament is, of course, out of the question.<br/>&gt; But, strange to say, it is only within the last half century that the<br/>&gt; system of equal temperament has been universally adopted, and some<br/>&gt; tuners, even now, will try to favor the flat keys because they are<br/>&gt; used more by the mass of players who play little but popular music,<br/>&gt; which is mostly written in keys having flats in the signature.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So then, by 1907 even though ET is supposedly &quot;universally adopted&quot;,<br/>&gt; this guy reports that flat-key-favoring is still being done to a<br/>&gt; degree that (to him) is alarming, and contemptible, even though it<br/>&gt; sounds terrific in the music to be played.......<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course, to such an argument there couldn&apos;t be any sound *musical*<br/>&gt; or theoretical reasons to favor sweet flats and highish sharps--even<br/>&gt; though the part 2 of my article lays out a detailed theory of exactly<br/>&gt; that, by examining how far we are away from C by the spiral of 5ths.<br/>&gt; The note A-flat *is* much closer to C (only four positions) than G#<br/>&gt; is (eight positions), and that right there is a pretty good reason to<br/>&gt; favor it tuned closer to A-flat than to G#.  Never mind the dumb<br/>&gt; dodos who just want to play piles of trash pop music in flats...what<br/>&gt; if that, right there, is an idiom where the vernacular reminds us<br/>&gt; what sounds good in practice, in music that is in flats *or* sharps?<br/>&gt; Mellow flats, bright/brilliant sharps, smoothly arranged in<br/>&gt; modulation around the spiral of 5ths from one key to the next, and<br/>&gt; centered on C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wasn&apos;t it Irving Berlin who played *everything* in deep flats?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bradley Lehman<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>&gt; of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com">tuning-nomail@yahoogroups.com</a> - turn off mail from the group.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>&gt;   <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

Strict (or extended -- the idea being<br/>that you use whatever ratio is needed to make each chord purely<br/>consonant, but you always use ratios) JI would require 21.5-cent<br/>(syntonic comma) shifts in many places, twice as large and more than<br/>twice as disturbing.
