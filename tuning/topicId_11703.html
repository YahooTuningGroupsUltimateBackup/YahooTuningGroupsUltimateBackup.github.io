Schulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@VALUE.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>8/22/2000 5:24:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and the Science Fair question seems to be an invitation<br/>for us to demonstrate ourselves how music, mathematics, and diverse<br/>cultural traditions can interact to produce very different judgments<br/>of &quot;in-tuneness&quot; or &quot;out-of-tuneness.&quot;</p><p>For example, objectively defined, the syntonic comma is simply the<br/>difference, for example, between a major sixth formed from a series of<br/>three pure 3:2 fifths (e.g. C-G-D-A), or 27:16, and a major sixth of<br/>the simplest possible ratio of 5:3. When we take the difference<br/>between the two intervals by dividing 27:16 by 5:3, we get 81:80, the<br/>syntonic comma.</p><p>Likewise, a major third built from four pure fifths, at 81:64, will be<br/>a syntonic comma wider than the simplest ratio for this interval at<br/>5:4 or 80:64.</p><p>Using the early 17th-century tool of logarithms, we often measure such<br/>musical intervals in cents, there being 1200 cents in a pure 2:1<br/>octave, and 100 cents in an equal semitone of 12-tone equal<br/>temperament or 12-tet. The syntonic comma at 81:80 is about 21.51<br/>cents, or a bit more than 1/5 of a 12-tet semitone.</p><p>However, the syntonic comma simply measures the difference between<br/>27:16 and 5:3, or between 81:64 and 5:4; it doesn&apos;t tell us which<br/>interval is more &quot;in tune&quot; or &quot;appropriate&quot; for a given piece of<br/>music.</p><p>If 81:64 or 27:16 is the preferred tuning for a major third or sixth,<br/>as in much medieval European music, then there is no problem, only an<br/>interesting mathematical observation. These thirds and sixths of<br/>Pythagorean tuning -- tuning in pure fifths or fourths -- are quite<br/>active, and nicely resolve to the stable fifths and fourths favored in<br/>the 13th and 14th centuries.</p><p>However, by around the middle of the 15th century, the simpler 5:4 and<br/>5:3 have come into vogue -- so what was nicely &quot;in tune&quot; a century<br/>earlier is now &quot;out of tune,&quot; and the syntonic comma has indeed become<br/>the leading &quot;problem&quot; of keyboard tunings.</p><p>The usual solution was to make each fifth slightly narrower than a<br/>pure 3:2, so that four of these narrowed or tempered fifths would<br/>exactly or approximately equal a 5:4 major third.</p><p>Maybe what I&apos;m trying to suggest is a kind of Intonational Theory of<br/>Relativity: &quot;in-tuneness&quot; or &quot;out-of-tuneness&quot; are relative to a given<br/>style of music. A &quot;real major sixth&quot; is 27:16 in medieval Pythagorean<br/>tuning, but at or close to 5:3 for most 16th-century music.</p><p>There are various experiments you could try to illustrate this very<br/>important point about mathematics and music, for example taking<br/>musical pieces from different eras, and tunings from these eras, and<br/>seeing if people can match which tuning historically is most likely to<br/>go with each piece. Also, will people prefer 81:64 major thirds for a<br/>medieval piece, but a 5:4 major third for a Renaissance piece -- or<br/>might they prefer another tuning such as 12-tone equal temperament<br/>which might be more familiar to some of them?</p><p>As others have mentioned, the research of William Sethares on tuning<br/>and timbre might also be very interesting, and lead into comparisons<br/>not only between different styles of European music, but between<br/>various world musics.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
