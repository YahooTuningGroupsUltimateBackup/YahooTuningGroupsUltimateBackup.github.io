My observation would be that the historical record indicates Bach always tuned his own instrument, so any objection that he did not follow historical precedent appears somewhat mute.  The proof of the pudding is how Bach&apos;s music sounds in this temperament (forgive the mixed metaphor), and this is something everyone can find out for themselves.</p><p>I would argue Bach certainly had the necessary background to create his own keyboard temperament.  His cousin Nikolaus was well-known as an instrument builder, and in 1706 beat Neidhardt in a tuning contest:  Nikolaus tuned a section of an organ by ear, while Neidhardt did another section; that of Nikolaus being judged superior to Neidhardt.  Then consider Bach&apos;s role as a consultant for the commissioning of organs; his critique of Silbermann&apos;s temperament as reported by Andreas Sorge and Edward John Hopkins.  Last, but not least, the two books of &quot;Well Tempered Clavier&quot; attest to Bach&apos;s personal interest in tuning.  That Bach&apos;s temperament breaks with tradition has precedents, moreover: consider, for example, his innovations with regard to keyboard fingering or his adaptation of concertos to the organ.  One would not expect, a priori, Bach&apos;s contemporaries to use his temperament, which may well have been a professional secret; but the same observation is not true for Bach&apos;s son&apos;s, and it is likely they maintained the tuning methods they were taught.</p><p>Regards<br/>Charles</p></div><h3><a id=53730 href="#53730">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/26/2004 12:51:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>How often we&apos;ve heard these exact words, with regard to this or that<br/>exact temperament!</p><p>Good luck,<br/>Paul</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Charles&quot; &lt;Francis@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wallyesterpaulrus&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Charles&quot; &lt;Francis@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I find these conclusions insupportable.
