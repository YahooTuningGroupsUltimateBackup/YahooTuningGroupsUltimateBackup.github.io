My hypothesis concerns many such<br/>systems.</p><p>The unison vectors you temper out are called &quot;commatic&quot; unison<br/>vectors. In my paper I don&apos;t assume that they are necessarily tempered<br/>out, or if they are, whether adaptive JI is used to do so, but in any<br/>case notes separated by a commatic unison vector get the same name.</p><p>The unison vector you don&apos;t temper out is called a &quot;chromatic&quot; unison<br/>vector. The meaning of this is clear by analogy with the usual meaning<br/>of chromatic alterations in common-practice Western diatonic 5-limit<br/>music.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>1. Common-practice Western diatonic 5-limit music.<br/>The diatonic scale is the periodicity block defined by the two unison<br/>vectors 81:80 (the syntonic comma) and 25:24 (the chromatic semitone).<br/>Tempering out the syntonic comma (that is, treating 81:80 as the<br/>commatic unison vector) but not the chromatic semitone (that is,<br/>treating the 25:24 as the chromatic unison vector) leads to meantone<br/>temperament. The diatonic scale is distributionally even in meantone<br/>temperament:<br/>L s L L L s L (and rotations thereof).<br/>135:128 can substitute for 25:24 as the chromatic unison vector if you<br/>wish.</p><p>2. My symmetrical decatonic system for 7-limit music.<br/>The symmetrical decatonic scale is the periodicity block defined by<br/>the three unison vectors 64:63, 50:49, and 49:48. Tempering out the<br/>64:63 and 50:49 (that is, treating those as the commatic unison<br/>vectors) but not the 49:48 (that is, treating that as the chromatic<br/>unison vector) leads to &quot;paultone&quot; temperament (close to 22-tET). The<br/>decatonic scale is distributionally even in &quot;paultone&quot; temperament:<br/>s s s s L s s s s L (and rotations thereof).<br/>225:224 can substitute for either 64:63 or 50:49 as the commatic<br/>unison vectors if you wish, and 25:24 or 28:27 can substitute for<br/>49:48 as the chromatic unison vector if you wish.</p><p>3. Dave Keenan&apos;s 31-tone MIRACLE scale for 11-limit music.<br/>The 31-tone scale is the periodicity block defined by the four unison<br/>vectors (if I recall correctly) 441:440, 385:384, 225:224, and 81:80.<br/>Treating the first three as commatic unison vectors and the last one<br/>as a chromatic unison vector leads to the distibutionally even scale<br/>(that is especially well-represented in 72-tET) that Dave described.<br/>Many substitutions are possible for the commatic and chromatic unison<br/>vectors.</p><p>Other examples abound in Dave Keenan&apos;s work.</p><p>So, can anyone prove this hypothesis?</p><p>P.S. If you leave two of the unison vectors un-tempered-out, you get<br/>the best candidate (I think) for what Carl Lumma was reaching for in<br/>suggesting a 2-dimensional generalization of an MOS. A periodicity<br/>block in strict JI with n unison vectors (or, equivalently, n distinct<br/>prime factors) would be the n-dimensional generalization of an MOS.</p></div><h3><a id=22138 href="#22138">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/5/2001 6:38:27 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, my hypothesis is not quite well-defined enough. Since the periodicity block is only<br/>defined up to arbitrary transpositions by the unison vectors, various distinct scales can result<br/>from the operation of tempering out all but one of the unison vectors. For example, in the<br/>meantone case, the melodic minor and harmonic minor scales are possible results in addition to<br/>the diatonic scale. So I&apos;ll have to modify the hypothesis to say, out of all the scales that can result<br/>from the operation, the one with the most consonances (intervals, triads, etc.) is the<br/>distributionally even one.</p></div><h3><a id=22171 href="#22171">ðŸ”—</a>David J.

So let&apos;s use &quot;quomma&quot; for somewhere between<br/>a quartertone and a comma.  Traditional names always refer to keys,<br/>not pitches.</p><p>I&apos;ve posted another copy of one of the files I posted in<br/>&lt;<a href="/tuning/topicId_22183.html#22183">/tuning/topicId_22183.html#22183</a>&gt;.  The black notes<br/>starting on C# above middle C (depending on your Scala setup) are the<br/>nominals 0 to 9.  So there&apos;s a semitone between each pair of black<br/>notes, except for every other Bb-C# which is a quomma wider.  You<br/>could try a non-octave tuning where all semitones are equal.  I found<br/>this easy to get used to, but expect having octave repetition will be<br/>better long-term.</p><p>Anyway, with this tuning each black note can be raised one quomma by<br/>moving a key to the right.  This change is what my &quot;^&quot; symbol refers<br/>to.  So the key to the right of the first C# is 0^.  Where there are<br/>two white notes between a pair of black notes, you can also move down<br/>a quomma to get 0v, 2v, 5v and 7v.</p><p>The &quot;high&quot; means that when in doubt a key is a quomma higher then the<br/>key to the left, rather than a quomma lower than the key to the right.<br/> This also means the ambiguous notes are lower then the &quot;low&quot; tuning<br/>so &quot;high&quot; could also be called &quot;minor&quot;.</p><p>The 21 note Blackjack scale is all black notes plus all white notes a<br/>quomma higher than a black note, plus 0v, a quomma lower than every<br/>other C#.</p><p>You can check &lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/decimal_lattice.htm">http://x31eq.com/decimal_lattice.htm</a>&gt; for<br/>clues on 11-limit harmony in decimal notation.  Everything between<br/>nominals approximates an 11-limit interval, except 4 semitones which<br/>is the wolf in 31-equal but I find sounds okay in 72-equal.  It<br/>approximates a 21:16.</p><p>Have I mentioned neutral third scales before?  0 anti-Dorian is<br/>0-1^-3-4^-6-7^-9-0 which fits the high tuning.  0 Rast is<br/>0-2v-3-4^-6-8v-9-0 which doesn&apos;t.  Both are subsets of the 10-note<br/>neutral-third MOS 0-1^-2v-3-4^-5v-6-7^-8v-9-0 which almost fits.<br/>These are good starting points, but you&apos;ll only cover a third of the<br/>Miracle scale with neutral thirds.</p><p>------------miracle_24hi.scl----------------<br/>24 note mapping for Erlich/Keenan Miracle scale<br/>!<br/>! high version, tuned to 72-equal<br/>!<br/>24<br/>!<br/>33.3333333333333333<br/>66.6666666666666667<br/>150.0<br/>183.333333333333333<br/>233.333333333333333<br/>266.666666666666667<br/>300.0<br/>383.333333333333333<br/>416.666666666666667<br/>500.0<br/>533.333333333333333<br/>583.333333333333333<br/>616.666666666666667<br/>650.0<br/>733.333333333333333<br/>766.666666666666667<br/>816.666666666666667<br/>850.0<br/>883.333333333333333<br/>966.666666666666667<br/>1000.0<br/>1083.33333333333333<br/>1116.66666666666667<br/>1200.0<br/>----------------end file--------------------</p></div><h3><a id=22365 href="#22365">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/10/2001 3:10:11 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Dave Keenan&quot; &lt;D.KEENAN@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; Is this a job for you, Joseph Pehrson?

I think you missed too much of<br/>the MIRACLE discussion while your computer was down.</p><p>Graham&apos;s numbers have nothing to do with 72-EDO _per se_,<br/>except that they do represent notes which are a subset<br/>of it.</p><p>The numbers 0 thru 9 are simply an easy way to designate<br/>the 10 nominals of the simplest MIRACLE MOS, and then Graham<br/>uses ^ and v (and ^^ and vv and beyond) to designate the<br/>alterations of those pitches which occur as one keeps cycling<br/>by means of the generator.

I like it a lot,<br/>but it is a whole new way of notating the pitches that<br/>doesn&apos;t relate it in any way to 12-EDO.  If that&apos;s important,<br/>as it probably is for you with your live performers but isn&apos;t<br/>for Graham and his electronics, then keep the ASCII 72-EDO<br/>that you&apos;re familiar with.  But Graham&apos;s decimal notation<br/>is worth learning for the different light it sheds on the<br/>structure of the family.</p><p>&gt; One can also use a kind of &quot;Halberstadt template&quot; notation, wherein<br/>&gt; one just writes down the notes on the keyboard as a template and<br/>&gt; then &quot;translates&quot; into the correct notes of 72-tET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But just numbers??  I don&apos;t get it.  It doesn&apos;t seem like writing<br/>&gt; music to me...  (??)</p><p>Joe, back around 900 AD someone (usually claimed to have<br/>been Hucbald, but he&apos;s been discredited by now) had a sudden<br/>brillant flash of insight in the struggle to notate music,<br/>that elusive time-bound sonic art: since there were only 7<br/>pitches, why not simply use the first 7 letters of the alphabet,<br/>with their built-in order, to represent the successive diatonic<br/>pitches?  Bingo!  Modern standard musical notation was born.</p><p>Along with this, there&apos;s the standard musical lingo of<br/>&quot;2nd&quot;, &quot;3rd&quot;, &quot;4th&quot;, &quot;5th&quot;, &quot;6th&quot;, 7th&quot;, &quot;8ve&quot; (shorthand<br/>for &quot;octave&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;8th&quot;), &quot;9th&quot;, &quot;10th&quot;, &quot;11th&quot;,<br/>&quot;12th&quot;, and &quot;13th&quot;.  The ones beyond &quot;8ve&quot; are certainly<br/>used to designate those intervals, but the basic system<br/>starts at 1 and stops at 7, with the &quot;8ve&quot; being the special<br/>case that&apos;s equivalent to 1.  The only thing different here<br/>is that they refer more to intervals than to pitches (altho<br/>indirectly they refer to the pitches too), so *ordinal* numbers<br/>are used to designated the *cardinality* of the scale.</p><p>Graham&apos;s numbers work in exactly the same way, with the<br/>exact analogue being the letter notation.</p><p>Another method like this which you should be familiar with<br/>is Allen Forte&apos;s use of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, t, e<br/>(t being a single digit which = 10, e = 11) to designate the<br/>12 pitch-classes of 12-EDO.  This has by now become standard<br/>in all the academic theory journals.</p><p>But did you ever stop to consider how incongruous it is that<br/>if the &quot;root&quot; = 0, then a &quot;3rd&quot; = 4, a &quot;5th&quot; = 7, a &quot;7th&quot; = 10,<br/>etc.?  My guess is that you probably haven&apos;t, simply because<br/>you&apos;ve grown up with this wierd amalgamation and never gave<br/>it a second thought.

More<br/>&gt; MOS&apos;s occur again, expectedly, at 51 and 61, but we&apos;ve<br/>&gt; only taken a small look at 21 (blackjack), barely scratched<br/>&gt; the surface of 31 (canasta), and hardly discussed 41 at all.<br/>&gt; (See, it doesn&apos;t even have a card-game-name yet...)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve got it.  Well, I really do believe the path I want to<br/>follow now is with 72-tET notation and all the various MIRACLE<br/>subsets.  There&apos;s a lifetime of practical work in that...</p><p>&gt; Graham&apos;s notation is just a way of vastly simplifying the<br/>&gt; representation of this family of tunings.  I like it a lot,<br/>&gt; but it is a whole new way of notating the pitches that<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t relate it in any way to 12-EDO.</p><p>And, of course, that&apos;s my MAIN opposition, and the opposition, most<br/>probably, of EVERY performing musician....</p><p>&gt; Graham&apos;s numbers work in exactly the same way, with the<br/>&gt; exact analogue being the letter notation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another method like this which you should be familiar with<br/>&gt; is Allen Forte&apos;s use of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, t, e<br/>&gt; (t being a single digit which = 10, e = 11) to designate the<br/>&gt; 12 pitch-classes of 12-EDO.  This has by now become standard<br/>&gt; in all the academic theory journals.</p><p>Of course I learned this stuff.  One can&apos;t get through music school<br/>without it...  However, it was ALWAYS used in thoretical studies.</p><p>Nobody every PLAYED from it, and people PLAY from notation,<br/>supposedly...</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; But did you ever stop to consider how incongruous it is that<br/>&gt; if the &quot;root&quot; = 0, then a &quot;3rd&quot; = 4, a &quot;5th&quot; = 7, a &quot;7th&quot; = 10,<br/>&gt; etc.?  My guess is that you probably haven&apos;t, simply because<br/>&gt; you&apos;ve grown up with this wierd amalgamation and never gave<br/>&gt; it a second thought.  (If you have thought of it, then good<br/>&gt; for you!  Most musicians don&apos;t.)<br/>&gt;</p><p>Of course I have thought of that, just in comparing it with<br/>traditional set theory.</p><p>But the point is, we have to work and build on what we already HAVE,<br/>or they whole thing is a theoretical or academic exercise... in or<br/>out of a school!</p><p>____________ _______ ______ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
