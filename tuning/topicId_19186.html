The cromatico keyboard assumes the use of quarter comma<br/>meantone<br/>tuning, which normally allows only 8 pure thirds. Each accidental is<br/>split<br/>to<br/>provide both a true sharp and flat, and true B sharp and E sharp keys<br/>are<br/>also provided.  This permits 7 additional pure thirds.  Antique<br/>cromaticos<br/>were made from the mid 16e until 1660 and later, but there is no<br/>antique<br/>cromatico which survives intact.  However parts do survive from four<br/>cromatic<br/>cembalos which were later rebuilt into normal harpsichords. (Two<br/>survive as<br/>cases with repinned soundboards, two others are cromatico keyboards<br/>which<br/>were  later modified into 12 notes/octave keyboards and installed in<br/>new 18e<br/>harpsichords.)  Mid-16e writers such as Vicentino (1555) and Zarlino<br/>(1558)<br/>discuss the cromatico in matter-of-fact terms suggesting that they<br/>were<br/>already known.  Luzzaschi introduced Gesualdo to the cromatico in 1584<br/>at<br/>the<br/>Ferrara court where it had been used as an exclusive court instrument.<br/>Gesualdo returned to Naples where local musical fashion seized on the<br/>new<br/>idea, providing both theoretical writings (Stella, Colona) and a<br/>considerable solo repertoire.  Published Neapolitan composers between<br/>1603<br/>and 1641 include:  de Macque,  Trabaci, Mayone, del Buono, Salvatore,<br/>and<br/>perhaps M. Rossi (his famous seventh toccata).</p><p>    In 1618 Praetorius described a cromatico which he knew in Prague.<br/>By<br/>chance that particular cromatico is well documented in Hapsburg<br/>inventories<br/>from Prague and Vienna, and was available to Arcimboldo when he was<br/>preparing<br/>his discussion of direct conversions between paintings and musical<br/>compositions, using a cromatico, which he published in 1590.  The<br/>Hapsburg<br/>cromatico itself is known to have been inspired by a cromatico seen in<br/>Venice<br/>before 1574 by the Hapsburg court organist Jean Buis, who immediately<br/>ordered<br/>one for the court in Vienna.  It was moved to Prague 10 years later.<br/>Praetorius&iuml;&iquest;&half; account inspired further cromaticos to be made in northern<br/>Europe.</p></div>
