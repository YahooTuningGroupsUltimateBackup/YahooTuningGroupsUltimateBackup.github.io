In the low bass, the fundamental is often<br/>lacking and must be extrapolated, and in the top treble, the fundamental is<br/>usually all there is).  The most important frequencies in piano tuning are<br/>the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th partials of the notes.  We use these as &quot;vernier&quot;<br/>guides to setting the pitch.</p><p>&gt;I have had *some,* and, clearly, the accuracy of counting beats really<br/>&gt;distinguishes a fine piano from an old &quot;clunker.&quot;</p><p>  Hmm, I am somewhat uncertain of the intended meaning of the above, but will<br/>take a shot.<br/>     The beating we use to aurally tune pianos occurs at the 3:2 and 5:4<br/>coincidentals,(fifths and thirds).  In ET we also check the sixths, tenths,<br/>and 17ths for progression.  Accuracy depends on how easy it is to sort them<br/>out.  Some old clunkers have very clear partials and are easy to tune, and it<br/>is not uncommon on the Bechsteins and Bosendorfers to find an amazing array<br/>of partials competing for the ear&apos;s attention.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Right: on many pianos, the timbres themselves beat -- sometimes, even<br/>a single string will beat!</p><p>      The single string beating is usually due to poor termination at the<br/>bridge. Called &quot;false beats&quot;,  these are usually found in the top two<br/>octaves, and are commonly hidden by phase manipulation with the other two<br/>strings.<br/>Regards,<br/>Ed Foote RPT<br/>Nashville, Tn.</p></div><h3><a id=16644 href="#16644">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;josephpehrson@compuserve.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2000 8:28:22 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, a440a@a... wrote:<br/><a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16632">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/16632</a></p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I have had *some,* and, clearly, the accuracy of counting beats<br/>really distinguishes a fine piano from an old &quot;clunker.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Hmm, I am somewhat uncertain of the intended meaning of the<br/>above,<br/>but will take a shot.<br/>&gt;      The beating we use to aurally tune pianos occurs at the 3:2<br/>and<br/>5:4  coincidentals,(fifths and thirds).

Is there a reason for that lack of &quot;clarity&quot; in an<br/>old piano??</p><p>_______ ___ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
