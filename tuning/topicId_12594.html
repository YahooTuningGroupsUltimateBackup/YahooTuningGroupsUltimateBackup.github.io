I do not recall the question of the original poster, so if he was<br/>requesting a MIDI synth, then my answer was useless. No, not entirely useless, since GR300s can be had<br/>for a song, and they work!<br/>    Things have changed so much since the original MIDI standard was written, it seems to me its time<br/>for another more flexible standard of electronic instrument communication. Does anyone know if there<br/>is anything going on in this area? Any serious alternatives suggested or in the pipes?</p><p>--<br/>John Starrett<br/>&quot;We have nothing to fear but the scary stuff.&quot;</p></div>
