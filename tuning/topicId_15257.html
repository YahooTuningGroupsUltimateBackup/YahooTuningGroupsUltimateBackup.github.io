For ET&apos;s, one simply enters a ratio (which can be<br/>calculated by the program) for 1 step, then define the &quot;octave&quot; as one<br/>degree. This duplicates the interval for the whole midi gamut. Only 64<br/>notes can be indicated per card, but multiple cards can be defined for<br/>large, non-repetitive tunings.</p><p>I&apos;ve uploaded several scale archives to the Mills server in the past. If<br/>they are not available, let me know and I&apos;ll replace them or send them<br/>to the Onelist site when I get my primary computer repaired, hopefully<br/>early next week.</p><p>--John</p></div>
