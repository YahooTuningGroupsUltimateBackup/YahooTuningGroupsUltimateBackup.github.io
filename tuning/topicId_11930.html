As the orbits<br/>are ellipses, He considered the planets moving in and out of these relation ships , like<br/>suspensions found in music.</p><p>Monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; &gt; [Kraig Grady, o<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11929">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/11929</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Monz and Paul!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    I find this type of logic rather so all inclusive as to<br/>&gt; &gt; not be meaningful. It is too easy to run down simple ratios<br/>&gt; &gt; until you fine one that worked. In fact if you took random<br/>&gt; &gt; numbers the results would be the same. As I stated before,<br/>&gt; &gt; the relationships between the planets are not simple ratios.<br/>&gt; &gt; If they were, a resonance would build up and destroy the orbit.<br/>&gt; &gt; golden/noble relationships seem to be a necessity.<br/>&gt; &gt;    The problem will be as there are a infinite of whole number<br/>&gt; &gt; relationships, there are a infinite series of noble numbers;<br/>&gt; &gt; both can express the continuum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not going to argue against the possibility of describing<br/>&gt; the relationships between the planetary orbital periods in myriad<br/>&gt; different ways other than low-integer ratios.  My piece and the<br/>&gt; post that explained it was simply an excercise exploring the<br/>&gt; ancient concept of &apos;music of the spheres&apos;, which was based<br/>&gt; primarily on low-integer ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But you have to be careful to make sure that your ideas are<br/>&gt; reconciled with the physical facts.  Astronomers are certain<br/>&gt; that the Venus/Earth 13:8 ratio (actually, they seem to recognize<br/>&gt; it more as 8:5, but 13:8 is much more precise), the Jupiter/Saturn<br/>&gt; 5:2, and especially the Neptune/Pluto 3:2 ratio exist, and in<br/>&gt; fact the word that they use to describe these synchronicities<br/>&gt; is precisely the one you see as a problem: resonance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If the resonance were manifest thru the *overall* relationships<br/>&gt; of all 9 planets, then yes, perhaps it would destroy the orbits.<br/>&gt; But what I examined in detail in my post was the individual<br/>&gt; ratios between any two planets.  There *are* resonances in some<br/>&gt; of these cases, and they bring no apparent harm to the planets<br/>&gt; involved; I believe that the effect is small and subtle, probably<br/>&gt; similar to the tidal forces exerted by the Moon, but not as strong.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Please note that while I explored many possible rational<br/>&gt; interpretations of these orbits in my post, I did *not* use<br/>&gt; low-integer ratios in my MIDI-file.  The sound you are hearing<br/>&gt; is a very precise mapping of the actual orbital frequency ratios,<br/>&gt; which are *not* (except for the 3 cases noted above) very close<br/>&gt; to low-integer ratios.
