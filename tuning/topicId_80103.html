I would guess that it is<br/>due to some level problems, ie clipping of the waveform - but I have<br/>no idea how to solve it. Increasing sample rate doesn&apos;t generally work.</p><p>The mathematica function &apos;Play&apos; has an option to &apos;Automatically select<br/>the range of function values to use for amplitudes&apos; but it is not<br/>clear how this could help. I have tried adjusting its values but it<br/>only gets worse mostly...</p><p>I have noticed similar effects in synthesized sounds made by other<br/>people occasionally, but I can&apos;t recall an example immediately.<br/>Any ideas??<br/>~~~T~~~</p></div>
