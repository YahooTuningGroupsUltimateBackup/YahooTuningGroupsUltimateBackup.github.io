Musical<br/>&gt; training seems strip away that kind of perception.<br/>&gt;</p><p>This might be of interest. In the 9th Century an anonymous writer presented what some consider<br/>to be the first detailed account of early polyphony, the &apos;Musica enchiriadis &amp; Scholia<br/>enchiriadis &apos; (Manual on Music and Commentary on the Manual). Two types of harmonisation of<br/>chants were presented; parallel organum - duplication of the chant at the fourth, fifth or<br/>octave and oblique organum which used oblique motion and the coming together of voices in a<br/>unison cadence.</p><p>What I find interesting is how this early polyphony came about. I can see two possible<br/>reasons.  Communities that live and sing together (and in the case of polyphonic development<br/>we are talking mainly about the harmonising of sacred chants by monks) will show a tendency to<br/>make changes to their music, particularly if the same music is sung or played the same way<br/>year in, year out. Human beings can&apos;t resist change, though the Eastern Orthodox Church claims<br/>to have preserved its beautiful sacred chants better than the Western Church. The chants had a<br/>limited range. If the lead singer or singers sang the chants around about the mutual zone<br/>between bass and tenor, fine, but if the chant started off a bit too low the tenors would<br/>struggle and probably want to harmonise at a 4/3 above. Counter-tenors must have struggled.<br/>Given a developmental period of several hundred years I imagine the abbots of the monasteries<br/>would tolerate change over the years.</p><p>I have been fortunate  to have participated in and observed the changes that take place over<br/>time, not with monks of course, but in a community that chanted and sang a fairly unvaried<br/>&apos;repertoire&apos; several times a day year in, year out. In addition to the tendencies towards<br/>melodic variation, extension and repetition the most obvious point to make is that girls and<br/>women will naturally sing at the 2/1 above the men. Have we overlooked this simple fact in our<br/>discussion of octave equivalence? However, in the middle ages, according to the theorist<br/>Guido, octave doubling had no place. Perhaps he or &apos;they&apos; disapproved of the high voices,<br/>which in those days would have been boys or counter-tenors. Or perhaps it was dismissed as a<br/>bad &apos;habit.&apos;</p><p>Back to modern times, some singers over time began to pitch up or down a 3/2 or 4/3.  These<br/>were usually the tenors. Then the 5-limit prima donnas would start to embellish top lines<br/>with  relatively pure thirds.</p><p>Secondly, I think that the spontaneous 4th and 5th harmonisation is a very natural expression<br/>of our basic inner harmonic template. It might be that the trained musician or the modern<br/>person working from the intellect refines this by intellectualising the process and<br/>consciously seeking more &apos;complex&apos; intervals or higher primes. I don&apos;t think that the average<br/>monk in a medieval monastic community thought too much about the harmony as it developed so<br/>one conclusion might be that there was a &apos;natural tendency&apos; to harmonise in fourths and<br/>fifths.  I have gathered from my readings in JI theory, in particular Partch, that we in the<br/>Western musical world have moved from 3- to 5- and now on to 7 and above - limit in our<br/>musical explorations. In the context of the discussion about evolution that permeated the<br/>thread I&apos;m following I find it intriguing to speculate that our harmonic template in the West<br/>has evolved in a culturally specific manner over time, though more slowly than the output of<br/>actual music. I attach no quality judgement to evolution in this sense. Perhaps we found it<br/>more natural to harmonise in thirds as we evolved, though we needed to think a bit more  about<br/>it. I can hear some of you wondering where blues harmony, as sung or played in non12-tet, fits<br/>into this. That&apos;s for another thread.</p><p>As for organum, I use it from time to time in my choral compositions and I find the texture<br/>most distinctive and I would recommend the singing of organum to anyone seriously interested<br/>in tuning. This is one case where singers will instinctively reach for the pure intervals.</p><p>JI monks - who would have believed it.</p></div><h3><a id=13714 href="#13714">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/27/2000 10:00:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a>, Alison Monteith wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13676">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/13676</a></p><p>responded to my observation about &apos;perfect 4th/5th&apos;-equivalence<br/>(in analogy to &apos;8ve&apos;-equivalence) with a whole lot of stuff about<br/>the _enchiriadis_ treatises, organum, and medieval intonation,<br/>and concluded with:</p><p>&gt; JI monks - who would have believed it.</p><p>Well, Alison, I certainly would.

I can&apos;t find anything on it right now<br/>that I can publish, but eventually I&apos;ll have a webpage about it.<br/>I have some very radical theories about what the &apos;Daseian&apos;<br/>notation meant.</p><p>Another unpublished article I should put on the web is one<br/>where I examine the Greek-letter notation used in an example<br/>of his book by Boethius, which I think documents conclusively<br/>that the diatonic genus, at least in Boethius&apos;s time (Italy,<br/>c. 500 AD) used 5-limit intervals.  The notational symbols<br/>discrimate between two notes separated by the syntonic comma<br/>(~22 cents) but not between notes separated by the skhisma<br/>(~ 2 cents).</p><p>In general, what I find is that theorists wrote descriptions<br/>of music that either directly confirm or indirectly imply<br/>5-limit JI tuning being used in practice all the way back<br/>as far as the Sumerians (c. 3000 BC).  &apos;Pythagorean&apos; tuning<br/>doctrine was certainly firmly established in Babylon 1000<br/>years later, and the reasons why it became so firmly entrenched<br/>in European theory were mainly historical (wish to emulate<br/>ancient Greek theory) and partly matters of musical style.<br/>(many papers published here by Margo document the latter)</p><p>Last but not least, and pretty much unrelated to all of this,<br/>a few posts back you asked Paul Erlich &apos;what about middle-C?&apos;.<br/>I thought I&apos;d dredge up an old post I wrote about how middle-C<br/>functions in my theory, with a bit of a quote:</p><p>I wrote:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/2801">http://www.egroups.com/message/tuning/2801</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you call &apos;middle-C&apos; your n^0 or 1:1, then the bottom end<br/>&gt; of the audible range would give a 16 Hz &apos;C&apos; with the ratio<br/>&gt; 2^-4 or 1:16, and the note an &apos;octave&apos; above &apos;5-line high C&apos;,<br/>&gt; which is pretty much the useful limit for instruments and notation<br/>&gt; on the high end (exceptions noted) has the ratio 2^4 or 16:1.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This gives a very neat symmetrical layout to the whole &apos;usable&apos;<br/>&gt; range of pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; An explanation with a musical example can be found in my original<br/>&gt; paper about my theory:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/article/article.htm</a></p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
