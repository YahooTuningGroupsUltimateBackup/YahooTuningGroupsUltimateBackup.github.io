Actually, my goal was simply to relieve my own funnybone, but<br/>thanks for sharing.</p><p>Your analysis is fascinating (and I recommend it to any who has not<br/>seen/heard it). I&apos;m particularly interested in your &quot;descriptions&quot; of the<br/>&quot;very blue&quot; sevenths and thirds. To my ears, they sound very close to an<br/>aurally tuned blue seven (8:7) and blue third (6:7).

I&apos;m happy to share them but please understand<br/>that I am not pushing any particular &quot;theory&quot; of tuning. This is strictly<br/>empirical and you are free (obviously) to take or leave as you wish.<br/>However, your responses, theories and possible explanations are warmly<br/>welcome.</p><p>After more than a half century of listening to singers tune, it is very<br/>clear to me that the human ear has its own &quot;free style&quot; of seeking out the<br/>&quot;most consonant&quot; adjustments of collective pitches, both harmonic and<br/>melodic. The important factor here is that sensitive ensemble singers (both<br/>veteran and novice) seem to agree when a particular chord locks into<br/>consonance. In other words, there seems to be a &quot;correct&quot; tuning for them.</p><p>Now here is the kicker. The tuning they agree on does not necessarily<br/>correspond to just intonation, at least not to a simple version of it. Try<br/>this experiment: (I have observed it countless times with countless<br/>singers.) Sustain a low pitch and have a singer (or singers) tune a major<br/>tenth above it. It will likely tune slightly lower than a tempered-tuned<br/>third, presumably at a 4:5 ratio. While this sound continues, introduce the<br/>perfect fifth above the low pitch. You will observe the voice(s) singing the<br/>tenth (third) struggle to maintain that pitch and eventually float it upward<br/>and &quot;lock&quot; at at point ABOVE the tempered-tuned third. This suggests that<br/>singers do NOT tend to sing a 4:5:6 major triad. (Forget the Pythagorean<br/>third. It is way too sharp.) (It also seems unlikely that this &quot;high third&quot;<br/>is a product of culture, since it appears to be arrived at in terms of<br/>consonance, as opposed to learned preference.)</p><p>Regarding &quot;adaptive&quot; tuning as described by Mr. Wolf, in my experience it is<br/>the melody that most clearly attempts to escape tempered confines. I tend to<br/>agree with Pablo Casals that chromatic pitches stylistically tend<br/>melodically to &quot;lean toward&quot; their destination (or &quot;sponsoring&quot;) pitches.<br/>Lower chromatic neighbors (G# to A) tend to be very much higher than upper<br/>chromatic neighbors (Ab to G) no matter their acoustic or theoretical<br/>context.</p><p>Also, diminished triads, contrary to Mr. Wolf&apos;s description, in my<br/>experience seem NOT to conform to a tempered configuration. A diminished<br/>triad most commonly contains a functional tritone (presumably the same one<br/>that drove Medieval theorists nuts) that acoustically must make up its mind<br/>regarding its allegiance. It is only the tempered keyboard tritone that is<br/>immune. An acoustic tritone (5:7 or 7:10) appears to lean one way or the<br/>other and tunes accordingly. For example, a B-F tritone (diminished fifth)<br/>relates to a C tonic while a B-E# tritone (augmented fourth) relates to an<br/>F# tonic. It appears to me that this difference is aurally evident in both<br/>melodic and harmonic practice. (If your music teacher told you that the 7th<br/>partial is &quot;unusable,&quot; he was very mistaken.)</p><p>In my experience, tempered-induced tuning (vocal parts learned from piano<br/>models) are much more likely to &quot;drift&quot; than aural (just?) tuning. Since<br/>tempered-tuned &quot;harmony&quot; never quite locks, the overall pitch (when<br/>unaccompanied) often tends to sag, often exaggerated by less-than-optimal<br/>vocal techniques, and eventually takes a dive. In contrast, choral singers<br/>attuned to flexible &quot;free&quot; tuning tend to maintain a given starting tonality<br/>over considerable time. Seems illogical, I know; but this is what I have<br/>observed.</p><p>Finally, vocals accompanied by &quot;decaying&quot; tempered sounds (guitar, piano)<br/>can easily maintain &quot;free&quot; tuning, resulting in very artistic and expressive<br/>performances. In such cases, it would seem that it is the harmonic aspect<br/>that is providing &quot;stability&quot; (albeit instrumental) while the melodic aspect<br/>bends pitches in artistic deviation from an &quot;expected&quot; norm. This seems in<br/>direct opposition to Mr. Wolf&apos;s description of &quot;adaptive tuning&quot; in which<br/>the harmony adapts to acoustic values while the melody clings to a learned<br/>(apparently) standard.</p><p>From numbers I know very little, but am learning. From sounds I know a lot,<br/>and am also still learning.</p><p>Your input is welcome.</p><p>Gerald Eskelin</p></div>
