You can programme any microtonal division of<br/>the octave or any pitch separately. Use the needle or use the sound, which<br/>has a triangular wave form, containing the odd partials. If you have access<br/>to the strings inside your piano you may try to pluck them right in the<br/>middle.<br/>The sound thus produced has the same overtone receipy as the Korg-sound.<br/>When<br/>you strike the key it will be much more difficult to hear. For serious<br/>piano-tuners an electronic device, giving fondamental frequencies, is still<br/>too rough.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I asked at our local music store, and all I got was a blank stare...</p><p>Is that the one with a toy-guitar in the front-window, selling postcards as<br/>well? :)</p><p>--Wim</p></div>
