Paul&apos;s comment about being a bit blustery because of his heritage is well taken too, I understand that. But, I grew up in the slums of St.Louis in the 1950&apos;s, and was talking much like the old drunken sailor when I was 5, and got even better at it as I grew older. A lot of jazz and blues musicians are well known for serious cussing (just read about the Chess record label, or Miles Davis&apos;s autobiography), and the &quot;dozens&quot; are a well known game of insults in the black community (listen to &quot;Hey Man&quot; by Bo Diddley, and it&apos;s pretty toned down). The sick insult between musicians who really respect each other is way old, and I always love running into folks from the Mid West, as they get the way I talk, and they do it themselves.</p><p>   I don&apos;t talk like that here, or with other proper and genteel white folks, don&apos;t want them to pop a vein. But, occasionally, when the insults start flying here, I&apos;ve been very tempted to call folks the names I think they deserve at that time...so Paul, if you can draw on your background to justify the way you talk, I guess it would be ok if I did too...agreed? Might be fun...best...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a></p></div>
