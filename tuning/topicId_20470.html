It is indeed a fascinating instrument, of<br/>which there is only one example in the whole world. I did somre work with<br/>it - in fact I have written two compositions for it. It is really easy to<br/>&quot;write&quot; for - you just draw on the mastic on the glass and then you sound<br/>out the results. Hoewever, if you get into the microtonal intricacies (which<br/>are all possible on the instrument, as you must have read in my interview,<br/>then I am sure that it must become very difficult to master the exact<br/>tunings, since the exactness of the music depends on the exactness of the<br/>drawing. If one of you, microtonal specialists from the West, who also knows<br/>how to &quot;draw&quot; well and exactly, could come to Moscow and get to this<br/>recording studio where the ANS synthesizer is located, then I am sure that<br/>you could achieve a lot of microtonal accomplishments by working on the<br/>instrument. I know that there is a CD out, published by &quot;Electroshock&quot;<br/>company, but they distribute it for an impossible price of $80. The best<br/>thing for anyone to do is just to dub it from a friend - or, hopefully,<br/>eventually they will lower the price to a more &quot;normal&quot; level.</p><p>If you don&apos;t mind, occasionally I will be posting some translations of<br/>interesting articles and other relevant material on microtonality, as I will<br/>be locating them in the local libraries and archives. I hope that you would<br/>find them of interest.</p><p>Anton Rovner</p></div><h3><a id=20472 href="#20472">ðŸ”—</a>ligonj@northstate.net</h3><span>3/27/2001 2:10:42 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Ant&quot; &lt;ant@d...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; If you don&apos;t mind, occasionally I will be posting some translations<br/>of<br/>&gt; interesting articles and other relevant material on microtonality,<br/>as I will<br/>&gt; be locating them in the local libraries and archives.
