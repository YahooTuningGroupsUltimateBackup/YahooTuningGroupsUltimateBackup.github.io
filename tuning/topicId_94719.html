From that, it is easy to calculate the 5-limit dwarf for 72et (with standard val.) Show data then tells us, among other things, that this is an Euler genus: all the divisors of 3^11 5^5 reduced to the octave. The lattice diagram command in rectangular mode shows, as expected, a 6x12 rectangular array of asterisks.</p><p>To get the most milage out of a 72 note scale we might want to temper up to (at least) the 11-limit. There are various excellent choices for doing that; one is prodigy, which tempers out 225/224 and 441/440. Going to the Modify pull-down menu and selecting Temper, we find various tempering options. A good choice here is &quot;Frobenius log-weighted (RMS-TOP)&quot;, aka Tenney-Euclidean. Putting 225/224 and 441/440 in the comma box, leaving 2 in the formal octave box, applying the tempering, then applying Normalize under the Edit menu gives a prodigy tempered version of the dwarf/genus, which should be in the pure-octaves version of TE tuning. Sadly, however, my computations don&apos;t quite check, though the two are close.</p></div>
