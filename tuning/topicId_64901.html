That&apos;s a fallacious statement. Dividing by zero is an illegal<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; operation. Even the simplest calculator will validate me, just run<br/>your<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; windows calculator and divide any number by 0 and see what I mean,<br/>unless of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; course you are dividing zero by zero, which yields a result the<br/>function of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; which is undefined.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The first software piece I tried gave me a different result...
