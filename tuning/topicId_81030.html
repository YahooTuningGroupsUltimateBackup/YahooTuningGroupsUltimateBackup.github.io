Maybe the next version of the tuning I give you should be<br/>&gt;&gt; limited to the 8 or so notes of the actual scale and not the 13 or so in the<br/>&gt;&gt; tuning).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   Nonetheless. ..you managed to create something fairly tonal despite<br/>&gt;&gt; this.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;     You have a pretty good ear...  But, I digress (and agree with Carl),<br/>&gt;&gt; your 13 out of 31(TET?) version of the tuning sounded the best for the sort<br/>&gt;&gt; of free-form piece you wrote.  If anything though, if sounds like you tried<br/>&gt;&gt; to create a 2/1 octave feel rather than the &quot;warped harmonic octave&quot; feel of<br/>&gt;&gt; my original scale within the PHI tuning.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   Anyhow, I know this stuff doesn&apos;t come easily (especially not mapping it<br/>&gt;&gt; into 3 different forms!) and good job!<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; --- On *Thu, 2/12/09, Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&lt;<a href="http://mc/compose?to=carl@">http://mc/compose?to=carl@</a>...&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt;* wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; From: Carl Lumma &lt;carl@... &lt;<a href="http://mc/compose?to=carl@lumma.org">http://mc/compose?to=carl@lumma.org</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: Golden Ratio ver 2 - improvisation with comparisons<br/>&gt;&gt; To: tuning@yahoogroups. com &lt;<a href="http://mc/compose?to=tuning@yahoogroups.com">http://mc/compose?to=tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, February 12, 2009, 6:30 PM<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;  --- In tuning@yahoogroups. com&lt;<a href="http://mc/compose?to=tuning%40yahoogroups.com">http://mc/compose?to=tuning%40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;,<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;vaisvil&quot; &lt;chrisvaisvil@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; ok,<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; This should work<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; =&gt; I improvised on Mike&apos;s tuning after finding some usable<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; intervals.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; 3 files at<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; <a href="http://micro">http://micro</a>. soonlabel. com/golden &lt;<a href="http://micro.soonlabel.com/golden">http://micro.soonlabel.com/golden</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; golden2.mp3 is Mike&apos;s new golden ratio scale<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; goldenlucy.mp3 is the same improvisation run through Lucy tuning 0<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; flat 5 sharp =&gt; this is a bit unfair because Mike&apos;s tuning is<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; effectively an 13 note tuning and therefore the minor 9th on the<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; keyboard is the octave for Mike - but a minor 9th for Lucy.<br/>&gt;&gt; &gt; golden13of31 =&gt; so I found a 13 note tuning.
