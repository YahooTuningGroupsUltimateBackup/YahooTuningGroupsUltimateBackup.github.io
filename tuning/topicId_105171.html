No.  But one of the main points of this approach is that we are defining consonance more broadly than mere dyads.  That 33/32 can form consonant harmonies with 9, 15, and 21; a chord such as 8:9:15:21:33 is indeed very consonant, as dropping the 8 makes it 3:5:7:11.

So shouldn&apos;t complexity stay<br/>&gt; the same?</p><p>I worked this out. The short story is</p><p>1) now that we&apos;re working with complex subgroups, weighted coordinates<br/>are the root of all evil<br/>2) if you use unweighted coordinates but a &quot;weighted norm&quot; (the Tp<br/>norm), then it becomes much simpler. (note the norm will have to be<br/>more than just &quot;weighted&quot; for more complex subgroups, but distorted in<br/>more complex ways)<br/>3) the real truth is that there are two types of Tp complexity -<br/>&quot;kernel complexity&quot; and &quot;mapping complexity&quot;, or something - and for<br/>almost all values of p, these two do NOT agree. They&apos;re both useful<br/>and have subtly different musical interpretations, which I&apos;m still<br/>tying down the nuances of.<br/>4) for the T2 (TE) norm and only the T2 norm, these two types of<br/>complexity DO agree - but one is a scaled version of the other.</p><p>This is what&apos;s really going on above. When it comes to defining TE<br/>complexity for prime-limits, you get lucky: you can define it as the<br/>norm of the multimonzo OR the multival associated with a temperament,<br/>and you get the same rankings for everything; one just ends up being a<br/>scaled version of the other. This is because the T2 (TE) norm is<br/>related to the L2 norm, and the L2 norm is magic and special.</p><p>So, we looked at this situation and were like &quot;hey, why don&apos;t these<br/>two measures agree perfectly?&quot; - but, we actually got lucky this time<br/>that the only disagreement was a simple scaling factor. They usually<br/>agree even less, and if we were using the T1 norm instead of the T2<br/>norm, they wouldn&apos;t have agreed at all.</p><p>The real takehome point here is that there are two types of Tp<br/>complexity. You&apos;re a fan of the thing I called kernel complexity,<br/>whereas Graham&apos;s a fan of the other one. Paul&apos;s ruined everything by<br/>using the T1 norm on monzos and then taking the T1 norm of the<br/>multival, but he&apos;s only doing that because he had the idea that the<br/>norm of the multival and multimonzo should be the same (because the<br/>coefficients are the same up to sign). So it&apos;s a brave new world now.</p><p>A longer exposition about all that is here:</p><p><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/21054">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/21054</a></p><p>-Mike</p></div><h3><a id=105309 href="#105309">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/6/2012 12:23:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Sorry for the delay.
