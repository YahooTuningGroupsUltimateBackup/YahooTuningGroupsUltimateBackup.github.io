The ratios corresponding most closely to these and their values in cents are:  135/128 (92.2), 10/9 (182.4), 88/75 (276.7), 9/8 (368.9), 64/49 (462.3), 11/8 (551.3), 22/15 (663.0), 49/32 (737.7), 160/99 (831.1), 75/44 (923.3), 9/5 (1017.6), 256/135 (1107.8).<br/>Note that 18/17 at 99.0 cents or 35/33 at 101.9 cents or 17/16 at 105 cents are not perceived when hearing a 100 cent semitone, in preference to a mistuned 16/15, with lots of beats.<br/>When Thomas started making electronic organs, they used only six tone generators, instead of twelve.  Each could play either of two adjacent semitones, but not both simultaneously.  Apparently they realized that most music most owners would want to play wouldn&apos;t have adjacent simultaneous semitones.<br/>All of your thirteen tones are very close to a just intonation ratio, about as close as a tempered fifth is to 3/2 (701.955 cents), but only 10/9, 9/8, 11/8 and 9/5 are likely to be perceived as consonant, although slightly tempered.  276.9 will be perceived as a badly tuned 7/6 (266.9) if at all, 461.5 as a sharp 13/10 (454.2) if at all, or a very flat 4/3 (498.0), 664.1 is unlikely to be heard as 16/11 (648.7), 738.5 as a flat 20/13 (745.8) if at all, 830.8 as a flat 13/8 (840.5) if at all, 923.1 as a flat 12/7 (933.1) if at all and 1107.7 as a sharp 17/9 (1101.1) if at all.<br/>You can see from the above that quartertones (50 cents apart) are not so far from some intervals involving 11 and 13.  But when you consider how bad the equal-tempered semitone sounds at 11.7 cents flat from 16/15, most of the ratios likely to be perceived as consonant are about as far sout of tune, which should yield a thoroughly nasty sounding scale with little to recommend it.  Even if one hear the lower number ratios, the scale would approximate:  1/1, 18/17, 7/6, 9/8, 13/10, 11/8, 16/11, 20/13, 13/8, 12/7, 9/5, 17/9, 2/1.  Would you want a scale like that in just intonation?  Maybe for Halloween.  Better still, for that use, to temper it and have beats.</p><p>The sequence of ratios giving successively closer approximations to the &quot;golden mean&quot; can be generated starting from 1/1 (as x/y) by successively using x+y/x.  This gives 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8,5, 13/8, etc.  These golden mean ratios occur in nature, for example in spirals such as the arrangement of seeds in the head of a sunflower.  Considered a visually pleasing ratio, it is often used in painting, sculpture, architecture and furniture design.<br/>Music, on the other hand, is a one dimensional art form, with changes in intensity over time.  We do not entirely perceive it that way because of the limitations of our senses.  We perceive rhythm as separate from melody, melody as only a fragment of harmony and harmony as perhaps related is some way to tone color, but independent of it.  The same piece is often be played on different instruments, or different combinations of instruments, or even with different tempos, yet is usually still  recognizable.  If this one dimensionality were not so, recording technology would have to be different.<br/>  One can, of course, imagine dividing a vibrating string by these different ratios, or using them to multiply or divide a particular frequency.  In terms of cents, these ratios represent, respectively:  0, 1200, 702, 884.4, 813.7, 840.5, etc., or unison, octave, perfect fifth, major sixth, minor sixth, etc.   Would you like to generate a scale using a &quot;circle&quot; of these successive approximations until you happen to come close to a multiple of 1200 cents?  The first four give three octaves:  2/1 X 3/2 X 5/3 X 8/5 = 8/1.  Note the roundoff error of 0.1 cent.  When using only four significant figures, this is to be expected at times.  But cents, a logarithmic measure, allow us to add and subtract instead of multiplying and dividing fractions (ratios).  They also make it easier to compare the sizes of intervals, such as 531441/523288 and 74/73.  Dividing, you get 1.0136432 and 1.0136986, respectively.  Only in the fourth significant figure (after the decimal and zero) does the difference show.  Rounded off these would be 1.0136 and 1.0137.  In cents, they are 23.5 and 23.6, respectively.  Interestingly, 13 X 18 = 234, somewhat off from 233/144, and 13 X 29 = 377, right on for 377/233.  But what you are looking for is another power of two, such as 16 or 32.<br/>Generally, the stronger the nearby consonances (lower numbers in the ratio), the broader will be the &quot;pull&quot; toward hearing that interval instead of some higher number ratio as an alternate consonance.  The more consonant ratio will be heard as out of tune, with beats.  In the case of these ratios, consider them versus each other as well as versus others in the same range of cents.  Ratios in which the numbers can be factored vary from the expectation, sounding more consonant, for example 16/9, which is 4 X 4/ 3 X 3.<br/>The problem here is that although you appear to be dealing with linear measure, as the eye perceives it and in terms of string lengths, you are actually dealing with a logarithmic phenomenon in terms of hearing.  From 100 to 200 cycles per second of vibration (Hertz) sounds like what we call an octave.  But the next higher octave is not 300, but 400 Hz.  This is the source of your difficulty in applying the idea of the golden mean to music.<br/>Also note that as we more closely approach the golden mean, rather than arriving as some previously undiscovered wonderful consonance, we ar moving further and further away from consonance and in the direction of dissonance.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Dale Scott &lt;<a href="mailto:adelscott@mail.utexas.edu">adelscott@mail.utexas.edu</a>&gt; 09/14 4:45 PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>From: Dale Scott &lt;<a href="mailto:adelscott@mail.utexas.edu">adelscott@mail.utexas.edu</a>&gt;</p><p>Golden ratio tunings have been mentioned here again recently, and it raises<br/>a question in my mind:  has there been much consideration by anyone of the<br/>use of ETs with Fibonacci cardinality as approximations to golden ratio<br/>tunings?
