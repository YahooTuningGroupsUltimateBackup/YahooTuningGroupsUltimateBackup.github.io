In this case his minor and major diesis are exactly the unison<br/>intervals that can be used as generators of a 13 sized periodicity block. In<br/>that sense they can be compared with 81/80 and 128/125 spanning a regular 12<br/>sized block in octave based tuning.</p><p>Suspending from the top tone means forming a 3/5/7 triad where the &apos;7&apos;<br/>coincides with the original &apos;3&apos;. It&apos;s best to visualize in a square lattice<br/>diagram:<br/>The basic triad is:</p><p>     7</p><p>     1   5</p><p>The added one would have it&apos;s &apos;7&apos; to on the &apos;1&apos;, so divide all elements by<br/>7.</p><p>     7</p><p>     1   5</p><p>    1/7 5/7</p><p>I left out the powers of 3 to show the basic relations.<br/>The next reasoning is not completely clear to me (Heinz?), but the result in<br/>the diagram is:</p><p> 7/5 7</p><p> 1/5 1   5</p><p>    1/7 5/7</p><p>The next process of &apos;filling in the gaps&apos; results in:</p><p>  49/25</p><p>   7/25  7/5   7</p><p>   1/25  1/5   1    5    25</p><p>              1/7  5/7  25/7</p><p>                        25/49</p><p>Which is a possible periodicity block.<br/>It helps to fill in the 13eq equivalents:</p><p>  8</p><p> 11   4   10</p><p>  1   7    0   6   12</p><p>           3   9    2</p><p>                    5</p><p>If you create a scale in the traditional JI way, you get &apos;my&apos; major BP<br/>scale:</p><p><a href="http://www.kees.cc/music/scale13/scale13.html">http://www.kees.cc/music/scale13/scale13.html</a></p><p>Which is a &apos;tryhill&apos; scale, without filling in the gaps.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p><p>Kees</p><p>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Joseph Pehrson [<a href="mailto:pehrson@pubmedia.com">mailto:pehrson@pubmedia.com</a>]<br/>&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 10, 2001 9:02 AM<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@egroups.com">tuning@egroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] BP questions<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have a couple of, probably pretty easy, BP questions...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In the first place, there is some talk on the BP website of the<br/>&gt; &quot;diesis&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://members.aol.com/bpsite/names.html">http://members.aol.com/bpsite/names.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; as the difference between the sizes of the BP semitones.

Is this how<br/>&gt;this term is generally used??</p><p>Well, it&apos;s usually used to mean the interval 128:125, or the amound by which<br/>a stack of three pure major thirds falls short of an octave.</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m confused, since I thought it had<br/>&gt;to do with the TEMPERING of a string of 12 Pythagorean fifths... but<br/>&gt;maybe I had that wrong in the first place.</p><p>You did, but no matter.</p><p>&gt;I was looking at Monz&apos; generally excellent dictionary, but it simply<br/>&gt;said that a &quot;diesis&quot; could be a term for a whole bunch of very small<br/>&gt;intervals...</p><p>That&apos;s correct. Bohlen uses the term &quot;diesis&quot; in this sense.</p><p>&gt;And shouldn&apos;t it have something to do with 12??  This scale consists<br/>&gt;of 13 steps...  What&apos;s with this??</p><p>&gt;AND, regarding the generation of the BP scale:</p><p>Bohlen&apos;s derivation is rather idiosyncratic. And the &quot;classic&quot; JI scale is a<br/>musico-historical myth anyway. Just think of it like this. 12-tET, 12 equal<br/>steps per 2:1, gives an excellent approximation (for an ET with that few<br/>notes) to all ratios of integers up to 6 -- hence allowing for 4:5:6:8<br/>chords and their mirrorings. The Pierce scale, 13 equal steps per 3:1, gives<br/>an excellent approximation to all ratios of _odd_ numbers up to 9, hence<br/>allowing for 3:5:7:9 chords and their mirrorings. In both cases,<br/>de-tempering the set of 12 or 13 to JI means that you have to choose where<br/>to put some &quot;wolves&quot; or out-of-tune intervals -- a choice with elements of<br/>arbitrariness in both cases.</p></div>
