The LCM and GCD functions<br/>are not available in the standard installation of Excel 97. If you see<br/>nothing but #NAME? in some columns try this (from the help file):</p><p>Run the Setup program to install the Analysis ToolPak. After you install<br/>the Analysis ToolPak, you must enable it by using the Add-Ins command on<br/>the Tools menu.</p><p>How to Install the Analysis ToolPak</p><p>If the Data Analysis command is not on the Tools menu, you need to install<br/>the Analysis ToolPak in Microsoft Excel.</p><p>To install the Analysis ToolPak</p><p>1&#x9;On the Tools menu, click Add-Ins.</p><p>If Analysis ToolPak is not listed in the Add-Ins dialog box, click Browse<br/>and locate the drive, folder name, and file name for the Analysis ToolPak<br/>add-in, Analys32.xll&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; usually located in the Library\Analysis folder&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD; or<br/>run the Setup program if it isn&apos;t installed.</p><p>2&#x9;Select the Analysis ToolPak check box.</p><p>Note   Add-ins you select in the Add-Ins dialog box remain active until you<br/>remove them.</p><p>Good luck.<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div>
