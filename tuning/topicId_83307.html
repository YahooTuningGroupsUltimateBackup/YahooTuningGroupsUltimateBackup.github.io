Well beating and dissonance are not necessarily the same thing so avoiding beating is not the issue. Besides, spacing notes should (theoretically) still produce beats with these numbers. And playing long notes should produce more beats than short ones so that speed or spacing don&apos;t come into it. I think the real issue is compositional. For example, starting a piece with notes long enough for the ear to get a grip on and then building chords slowly in layers, and things like that. In other words, dissonance is usually caused when things seem out of place. The fact that beating sometimes produces undesirable notes in tonal compositions is only one case in point.</p><p>&gt;    One thing is almost certainly for sure (and in common in both of our scale)...the purest interval set (kind of the equivalent of a major triad) within a &quot;PHI-tave&quot;/period appears to be 1 2/PHI PHI.  Next in line is probably 1 2/PHI 1/PHI^2+1 PHI...which is kinda like major 7th chord in tensity.

To be realistic, though, I think Chris hit the nail on the head<br/>&gt;  before when he said the Silver Ratio is a more consonant scale and I will admit there are some sour spots I found when I approached the challenge of using the PHI scale in a piece involving more than one 2/1 octave worth of frequency range.</p><p>In light of what I just said about dissonance, I don&apos;t buy that for a second. It might just happen to be true in your two pieces, but just to refer back to my approach as an example, a 2000 tet (for the silver)approximates far more rarified upper harmonics than a 36 (phi) tet. And there are loads of ideas which have not been explored yet. The semi-symmetrical phi chord 0:11:14:25 (including two 14&apos;s from the outsides and one 3 in the middle, equating to phi^2 and phi^3), the ordered scale based on phi squared sequence 0:25:50=14:75=3, etc...Then there is the fully symmetrical six-note scale 0:5:10:15:20:25 (and even this strange scale 0:4:8:16:20:24:28:32 which includes a diminished type chord based on the interval &apos;8&apos;, very close to the flattened minor third 7/6, AND something close to a major third 21 giving a type of augmented triad 0:20:40=4). And while 13/8 is one tonal interval with odd numerator and 2^N=1,2,3 in the denom (i.e.8ve&apos;s), others are 207/128 = 1.617..., 829/512 = 1.619.. and 1657/1024 = 1.618...These are very small in comparison to the silver ratio I gave the other day. So my feeling is that we haven&apos;t even scratched the surface yet, way too early to talk about consonance/dissonance.</p><p>Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    In dealing with the above issue/problem, I have also noticed a good amount of consonance can be gained (if you are only playing an instrument within a 3-4 Phi-tave range) by moving the PHI-tave to 1.625 (13/8) instead of 1.618: this preserved the odd harmonics/overtones slightly better.  Same goes for using around 1.406 (to estimate 1.4 IE 7/5) for the Silver Ratio scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=83340 href="#83340">ðŸ”—</a>chrisvaisvil@...</h3><span>5/2/2009 11:27:59 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I tried 36 tet and it is too wide for 49 keys to do much of any thing and really needs that special keyboard posted here or a mini-key format.</p><p>I used mikes correction to 1/phi and it made a big difference.</p><p>More later - one is in the oven with 1/phi</p><p>Chris<br/>Sent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile</p></div><h3><a id=83341 href="#83341">ðŸ”—</a>rick_ballan &#x3C;rick_ballan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/2/2009 12:32:59 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, chrisvaisvil@... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Man o man I don&apos;t know if I understand your request.

Obviously you wouldn&apos;t fit 36 into the standard keyboard 8ve, but it would fit into 3 8ve&apos;s. The interval that replaces the semitone is 2^(1/36) = 1.019441 and every successive tone is reached by multiplying this with itself. eg the interval that replaces the whole tone is (1.019441)^2 = 1.039259, the note assigned to the minor third is (1.019441)^3 = 1.059463 and so on till you do it 36 times to reach the 8ve. Once the keys are retuned, we can call them 0,1,2,...36. The Phi intervals are 11 and 25 i.e. B and Db from C in usual tuning.

You said<br/>&lt;2/PHI means, literally, 2/1.618034 = 1.236067, for example.  (1/PHI)^2 + 1 = (0.618034^2) + 1 = (0.3819) + 1 = 1.3819.  It&apos;s really that simple...&gt;.</p><p>Ok, your first value is simply 2^(11/36) = 1.235894. Or to just follow your logic through in indices, 2/1.618034 = 2 x 2^-(25/36) = 2^(36/36)x 2^-(25/36) = 2^(-25+36/36) = 2^(11/36). But this is easier by thinking of 2 as 36, phi as 25, and division becomes subtraction so that 2/phi becomes 36 - 25 = 11.</p><p>Now your second number here is more problematic. The value (1/PHI)^2 is ok and can be obtained as (2^-(25/36))^2 = 2^-(50/36) = 0.381859. Remember the first phi example you sent where you said we could hardly tell the difference between the two chords -25:0:25 and 0:11:25? This is because 8ve equivalence almost never seems to alter the harmonic content (This is a uniquely musical thing. Why it is I&apos;m not sure but it&apos;s so self-evident we can&apos;t explain it). Therefore we can bring this interval within a single 8ve (up two 8ve&apos;s) to obtain : -50 + 36 + 36 = 22 and 2^(22/36) = 1.527435. Just to check that this is indeed 8ve equivalent to your original value, dividing by 4 gives 0.381859. Notice also that 22 is 14 from 36 and that 14 is one of the original phi numbers i.e. the interval between phi and its inverse, 11 and 25.</p><p>However, the problem begins when you add 1. This is because it changes the harmonic content and is no longer a PHI number. For example, given a perfect fifth as 3/2 = 1.5, adding 1 gives 5/2 and the interval is now a major tenth (maj 3rd separated by an 8ve). Adding 1 again gives 7/2 etc...As you see, the fifth is not preserved by adding 1&apos;s. The closest number I could find to your value was 2^(17/36) = 1.387245, which isn&apos;t close enough. (I can understand how you got confused. Adding or subtracting 1 to PHI or its inverse is the only exception). So just to repeat, taking 0.381859 x 2 = 0.763718 and x 4 = 1.527435, that is -14 and 22, are the correct intervals from -50.</p><p>When Chris said that the silver was more consonant than the phi I knew there was something amiss but couldn&apos;t put my finger on it.</p><p>Hope this helps</p><p>-Rick</p><p>&gt; Mike&gt;&quot;Indeed...in that case I would have to space out the notes more to<br/>&gt; avoid beating to a high extent.

Hence the above effect is, in fact, intended.</p><p>Ok Mike, you asked me if I could find you a PHI tuning system and I did. It is elegant and simple, something which you look for in both mathematical proofs and musical composition. The discovery that we can reach PHI with a 36 note equal tempered system means that any phi chord or composition etc...can be transposed 35 times, which means 35 modulations. And because every PHI number can generate all 35 notes, then it can indeed be seen as a PHI based system. So statements like &quot;And, yes, 36TET gives slightly more accurate octave&quot;, which shows such a basic error, convinces me that you don&apos;t yet understand or fully appreciate it. Because it hits the octave EXACTLY which is WHY we adopt powers to the base 2. Taking the product of the 25th and 11th intervals gives 2, the perfect 8ve. Multiplying either PHI 25 or inverse PHI 11 by themselves 36 times will arrive at perfect 8ve equivalents. And if you read my past posts correctly you&apos;ll also see that I&apos;m multiplying/dividing by 2 all the time (i.e. or adding/subtracting 36).</p><p>Again when you say &quot;Feel free to show me an example where you swap my 1.3819 with your 1.3872 and prove your version sounds much better...but, as for now, it looks to me just the be a side-issue of aligning 36TET with 12TET&quot;, since this has absolutely nothing to do with 12 tet, then this just shows me more proof that you are using it as an excuse to avoid studying the mathematics I send. And where did you get that I said 1.3872 was the correct interval? Cause I said that 0.3819 was the correct PHI derivative, equal to 2^-(50/36), that is, inverse Phi squared. I also said that adding 1 to this interval, which is your number, was no longer in the PHI system. And below I see you are now replacing PHI by 13/8! We could have done from the word go, so it seems like a big step backwards to me (and besides, I thought you didn&apos;t like JI?). Come on Mike, I put allot of work into these posts and you could at least have the courtesy of reading them properly. The problem is solved, just apply it.</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>Rick&gt; &quot;When Chris said that the silver was more consonant than the phi I knew<br/>&gt; there was something amiss but couldn&apos;t put my finger on it.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Right but, if you read later on...he restated he thought the main problem had nothing to do with different versions of 1.38x or any of the other ratios, but PHI itself IE that 1 and the PHI-tave beat against each other too much.  And when I told him to estimate PHI as 1.625 (which has a VERY similar tonal color to 1.618)...he noted &quot;dramatic improvements&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Feel free to show me an example where you swap my 1.3819 with your 1.3872 and prove your version sounds much better...but, as for now, it looks to me just the be a side-issue of aligning 36TET with 12TET.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     And, yes, 36TET gives slightly more accurate octave, and I&apos;ve experimented with that myself by ear and do hear a bit of a difference (PHI vs. octave)...<br/>&gt;    So what does help though, I&apos;ve found is<br/>&gt; A) using 1.625 IE 13/8 instead of 1.618034<br/>&gt; B) making my PHI-scale using the PHI tave...but then cutting the part of it between 1 and 2 (not just between 1 and 1.618) and then using those 8 or so notes as a basis for an octave-based scale (this way you center on both PHI and the octave...without using inversions).  Actually, in some ways, this does show my scale somewhat adapting to 36TET...and we might want to try a version of it rounded into 36TET for grins.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- On Sat, 5/2/09, rick_ballan &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; From: rick_ballan &lt;rick_ballan@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: [tuning] Re: PHI interval tuning (for Michael S): with &quot;Phicicles&quot; song example :-)<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; Date: Saturday, May 2, 2009, 11:20 PM<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Hi Mike,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now that you wrote a clear definition of your approach I can analyse it. You said<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;2/PHI means, literally, 2/1.618034 = 1.236067, for example.  (1/PHI)^2 + 1 = (0.618034^2) + 1 = (0.3819) + 1 = 1.3819.  It&apos;s really that simple...&gt;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, your first value is simply 2^(11/36) = 1.235894. Or to just follow your logic through in indices, 2/1.618034 = 2 x 2^-(25/36) = 2^(36/36)x 2^-(25/36) = 2^(-25+36/36) = 2^(11/36). But this is easier by thinking of 2 as 36, phi as 25, and division becomes subtraction so that 2/phi becomes 36 - 25 = 11.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now your second number here is more problematic. The value (1/PHI)^2 is ok and can be obtained as (2^-(25/36)) ^2 = 2^-(50/36) = 0.381859. Remember the first phi example you sent where you said we could hardly tell the difference between the two chords -25:0:25 and 0:11:25? This is because 8ve equivalence almost never seems to alter the harmonic content (This is a uniquely musical thing. Why it is I&apos;m not sure but it&apos;s so self-evident we can&apos;t explain it). Therefore we can bring this interval within a single 8ve (up two 8ve&apos;s) to obtain : -50 + 36 + 36 = 22 and 2^(22/36) = 1.527435. Just to check that this is indeed 8ve equivalent to your original value, dividing by 4 gives 0.381859. Notice also that 22 is 14 from 36 and that 14 is one of the original phi numbers i.e. the interval between phi and its inverse, 11 and 25.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, the problem begins when you add 1. This is because it changes the harmonic content and is no longer a PHI number. For example, given a perfect fifth as 3/2 = 1.5, adding 1 gives 5/2 and the interval is now a major tenth (maj 3rd separated by an 8ve). Adding 1 again gives 7/2 etc...As you see, the fifth is not preserved by adding 1&apos;s. The closest number I could find to your value was 2^(17/36) = 1.387245, which isn&apos;t close enough. (I can understand how you got confused. Adding or subtracting 1 to PHI or its inverse is the only exception). So just to repeat, taking 0.381859 x 2 = 0.763718 and x 4 = 1.527435, that is -14 and 22, are the correct intervals from -50.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When Chris said that the silver was more consonant than the phi I knew there was something amiss but couldn&apos;t put my finger on it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hope this helps<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mike&gt;&quot;Indeed. ..in that case I would have to space out the notes more to<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; avoid beating to a high extent. The funny thing is the beating between<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; any two notes, at least to my ear, sound about equally pleasant in<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; their speed/modulation. ..and the only way to go further is to reduce<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the beating entirely by spreading the intervals out.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  Chris&gt; &quot;Not necessarily Mike. The original phi chord you sent had beats. Playing long extended notes would also produce them.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    True and I realize that...but I recommended (as I have several times) moving the 1.618034 PHI-tave to the almost indistinguishably different ratio of 1.625 to neutralize the odd-harmonic beats...yet you don&apos;t seem to want to do that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Chris&gt; &quot;You&apos;re being unclear again. What&apos;s 1 2/PHI PHI and 1 2/PHI 1/PHI^2+1<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; PHI...? This could mean 12/(phi^2) or 1 x 2/phi x phi etc... Ah, got<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; visitors, have to get back to you.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;     2/PHI means, literally, 2/1.618034 = 1.236067, for example.  (1/PHI)^2 + 1 = (0.618034^2) + 1 = (0.3819) + 1 = 1.3819.  It&apos;s really that simple...I don&apos;t understand why you seem to keep wanting to shove 12 (from 12TET?) into here for no apparent reason: soon as you start trying to fit this into 12TET logic...you tear apart the very basis of this scale (the PHI-tave and the inverse of it, 1/PHI, which is 0.618 instead of 1.618 which is exactly 1 under it while my formula uses + 1 in many place intentionally (see the connection?) ).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=83360 href="#83360">ðŸ”—</a>djtrancendance@...</h3><span>5/3/2009 1:47:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick&gt; &quot;So statements like &apos;And, yes, 36TET gives slightly more accurate<br/>octave&apos;, which shows such a basic error, convinces me that you don&apos;t<br/>yet understand or fully appreciate it.&quot;</p><p>And then you stated (a statement which seems to conflict heavily with what you said above)<br/>&gt;&quot;......Because it hits the octave EXACTLY which is WHY we adopt powers to the base 2.&quot;</p><p>   I do appreciate your scale and its parent tuning (36TET)&apos;s adherence to the standard octave (which seems to be a point you&apos;re making, even if you keep denying it, then proving it, then denying it)...I simply think it and my own scales are symmetrical in different ways.

Actually, my PHI theories have become progressively less random.&nbsp; My first set of scales was generated from the tuning PHI^x/2^y...where x = 0 to about 20...which has a massive number of tones per phi-tave (about 16 or so).<br/>&nbsp; My latest method res = (0.618^x) + 1 (where res must be &gt; 1.05 for sake of obeying the critical band) creates less than 5 results/notes, all of which can be mirrored (meaning take 2/1 - the results created above) to create up to about 9 notes that split the &quot;line between 1 and 2&quot; in a fashion similar to how PHI is used in real-world architecture.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now compare those 9 tones possible above to diatonic mean-tone which generates 12 notes.&nbsp; If anything, my method is less random than the standard.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the record, the acoustic property I am looking to enhance is proportionate beating...rather than simple having any two consecutive tones beat at the same rate (something the harmonic series does).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Put that together with the fact PHI itself has a similar feel to the octave (IE you can play &apos;random&apos; notes in the PHI scale and when you hit PHI your mind says &quot;octave!&quot;) and the fact 0 2/PHI PHI and -1/PHI 0 2/PHI have virtually the same sense of root tone (just like consecutive harmonics in the harmonic series)...and I think it&apos;s clear PHI does have some special and useful acoustic properties.</p><p>&nbsp; Not to say they are superior meant to replace anything...but rather they are relatively un-explored and offer a new alternative to musicians that are fairly on-par with more established musical systems.<br/>&nbsp; Given that I&apos;ve written two pieces using the above &quot;split line fractal scale generation system&quot; that have received 4-5 stars among everyday listeners (better than most of my 12TET songs...and I&apos;m not that good a composer)...it seems to say, for whatever reason, that there is something acoustically special about PHI.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>-Michael</p><p>--- On Tue, 5/5/09, Cameron Bobro &lt;misterbobro@...&gt;

Now take that same line, but move it &gt;between the values 1 and 2.  Artistically/in architecture, of &gt;course, the way PHI splits the line in the exact same way my scale &gt;does.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do not think that this analogy works for pitches.  Yes, the line &gt;intervals 0-1, 1-2 and 2-3 are equivalent on a piece of graph paper, &gt;or indeed on an artist&apos;s canvas, but not in the context of pitches.  &gt;The human ear perceives pitches according to a logarithmic scale, so &gt;that 1-2 is equivalent to 2-4 (not 2-3) and to 0.5-1 (not 0-1).  &gt;That is why multiplying and dividing are much more usual than adding &gt;and subtracting, when dealing with pitches.  That&apos;s not to say your &gt;way cannot work, but it is unusual.</p><p>What Michael is talking about is the Golden Section applied to the frequency realm. I don&apos;t know if it is unusual, but it certainly isn&apos;t new. Last year I mentioned here that I use the golden sections of frequencies rather than the noble mediant, and I&apos;m sure this has been tried in various ways for hundreds of years.</p><p>AKJ posted a big list of Phi tunings that are already in the Scala archive- in stark contrast to Michael&apos;s idea that it is a little-explored territory, it is a greatly explored territory.</p><p>At any rate, taking golden sections of frequencies is not necessarily numerology at all. But you have to understand the golden section in the first place.</p><p>Using the golden section of frequencies, you will discover a strange hall of mirrors in the tuning and difference tones- and the reflections appear in the logarithmic realm as well.</p><p>Check it out:</p><p>let&apos;s take the octave. Phi in the frequency realm, 1.618033988749895, marks a golden section of the octave. Now if we play the dyad of Phi and the 1/1, we get a curious difference tone- it is Phi mirrored below the 1/1, in the logarithmic realm, ie. it&apos;s 833.090 cents below 1/1 just as Phi is 833.090 cents above the 1/1.</p><p>The idea of a &quot;Phi-tave&quot; might start looking less &quot;numerological&quot; already, but let&apos;s not forget the golden proportion.</p><p>A golden proportion requires 3 quantities such that A is divided into B and C, and A is to B as B is to C. In order to hear our golden proportion here, we need to play A,B and C, which are 1/1, Phi, and 2/1, together. It&apos;s a strange and interesting sound, but maybe it&apos;s still kind of &quot;so what?&quot; at this point, so let&apos;s keep going.</p><p>Notice that above, I said &quot;a&quot; golden section, not &quot;the&quot; golden section. Let&apos;s call the first golden section of the octave in the frequency realm the upper section, for just as you can paint a saint at the golden cut of a canvas reading from the left, you can also make the cut from the right. This will not be the logarithmic reverse of Phi in the octave. The logarithmic reverse is already present in our original cut of course, being the logarithmic difference between Phi and the octave. We&apos;ll drop that interval, the logarithmic mirror of our original Phi within the octave, into the tuning for future reference.</p><p>Tuning so far:</p><p>1/1<br/>(366.910 cents)<br/>833.090 cents<br/> 2/1</p><p>Now let&apos;s make our lower golden cut of the octave, in the frequency realm.  This looks at first like a naive failure to understand the logarithmic nature of pitch perception, but as you will see, with Phi it works out a bit more interesting than that.</p><p>Taking freqency as a simple quantity, we subtract as much from the octave as we added earlier. This is 2-phi, just as Phi is 1+phi (phi being 1/Phi).</p><p>This gives us a frequency of 1.381966011250105, which works out to<br/>560.06656 cents.</p><p>Tuning so far:</p><p>1/1<br/>(366.910 cents)<br/>560.06656<br/>833.090 cents<br/> 2/1</p><p>This doesn&apos;t look too promising at first, but if you play it as a single sonority you may find it far less dissonant than it looks on paper, even very euphonic.</p><p>Now, as we looked at the difference tone of the first, upper, golden cut and the 1/1, let&apos;s look at the difference tone of the second, lower, cut and the 1/1.</p><p>-1666.181 cents</p><p>But hang on a second- we&apos;ve actually seen, or rather heard, that same difference tone before. In our original, upper, golden section, if we play B and C as a dyad, rather than A and B, there it is.</p><p>Now let&apos;s bring our difference tones up by octaves into the tuning. Our -833.090 appears as 366.910 cents, which we already have, and our -1666.181 appears as  733.81941 cents. Which we also already have as an interval, in mirror form: it is the same interval, logarithmically, from 2/1 as our original Phi cut is from it&apos;s logarithmic mirror (log. interval between 833.090 and 366.910), and it is also 366.910 above 366.910.</p><p>Our tuning so far:</p><p>1/1<br/>(366.910 cents )<br/>560.067 cents<br/>(733.819 cents)<br/>833.090 cents<br/>2/1</p><p>Playing this as a single sonority, once again we get what some might percieve as a very pleasant sound with a kind of &quot;oneness&quot; to it, only at this point we can demonstrate that we really are getting a hall of mirrors effect. Try the same thing with, say, 13/8, and you&apos;ll find that it is radically different. Right off the bat, the first difference tone is an 8/5 below the 1/1, and has the complete opposite implications of the Phi interval as far as tonality.</p><p>A little detour: if we take our two golden cuts, in the frequency realm, of the octave, and strike the geometric mean between them, we find the tempered fifth of quarter-comma meantone. Exactly.</p><p>Anyway, let&apos;s go on:</p><p>Inspired by the visual arts, how about let&apos;s take the golden section, in the frequency realm, of our first, higher, golden section. This works out to 1.381966011250105... hang on, it is exactly the same as the lower golden section of the octave. How about the lower golden section of our original Phi (&quot;B&quot;) section? Hm, we&apos;ve already got that interval, too, it&apos;s the B-C, logarithmically, of our original golden section.</p><p>And you can just keep on going: a hall of mirrors. For example, at this point you might as well throw in Phi modulo 2,  466.18100 cents, in the interests of symmetry, as it has already a number of times in the difference tones, octaved, and in the tuning itself.</p><p>1/1<br/>366.910 cents<br/>466.181 cents<br/>560.067 cents<br/>733.819 cents<br/>833.090 cents<br/>2/1</p><p>Now how about the golden sections of our original B:C?</p><p> 1068.86470 is the upper, 1.76393202250021, or  982.55396 cents, the lower. To no surprise, both have difference tones whose mirrors against the 1/1 already appears elsewhere in the tuning.</p><p>1/1<br/>366.910 cents<br/>466.181 cents<br/>560.067 cents<br/>733.819 cents<br/>833.090 cents<br/>982.554 cents<br/>1068.865 cents<br/> 2/1</p><p>This is quite beautiful IMO, and it is going to look very familiar to Michael- hopefully he&apos;ll have figured out by now that he&apos;s not the first to do explore the golden section, and that his explorations are only a beginning.</p><p>The tuning at this point now exhibts a surprising characteristic: the interval between degree 1 and degree 7 is a Just fifth of 3/2, and you will find 7-limit Just intervals within microscopic differences in the tuning and difference tones.  And so maybe you can see how this tuning leads &quot;naturally&quot; to what I call shadow tunings, which use Just and very non-Just intervals together. Another more blatant example of this- take a listen to the interval between the square root of 3 (another surd, like Phi) and its logarithmic inversion against the octave.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; AKJ&apos;s method, using 2^p (where p=0.618, or a Fibonacci-number &gt;approximation to it) is in fact splitting the octave geometrically &gt;(rather than arithmetically) and it seems to me to be the closest &gt;aural analogy to the visual splitting of a line segment.</p><p>There are many, many methods, and I&apos;m always happy when I discover that they&apos;ve been done before- the Fibonacci series modulo 2 (William Burt already did this), Phi as a member of the simple surds (John Chalmers already did this), and so on. I think my &quot;abs2cos(chop up circumference in different ways)&quot;, approach might be original in its different implementations, but Jacques Dudon already had the idea years ago. It&apos;s well explored but ever-fruitful territory.</p></div><h3><a id=83417 href="#83417">ðŸ”—</a>djtrancendance@...</h3><span>5/6/2009 8:06:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;If you enforce the somewhat artificial restriction that all<br/>tones have to be in a single octave, then there are triads<br/>more consonant than any tetrad, tetrads more consonant than<br/>any pentad, &quot;</p><p>&nbsp; Of course, the less notes (IE the further a sub-set you take) the more consonance in general.&nbsp; And a subset of my scale is always going to have more consonance than the entire scale played at once.&nbsp; But the impression I get (so far) is that Just Intonation itself implies certain consonance limits that step from the harmonic series.</p><p>&nbsp; And when I tried the harmonic series based scale 9/8 10/8 11/8 12/8 13/8 14/8 15/8 16/8&nbsp; 18/8 20/8 to make 8-tone per octave chords...I found out that my ears/mind actually objected to having so many tones beating against each other at the same rate (which actually sounds a bit mechanical and forced, even with pure sine waves).&nbsp; And, if I have it right, such a construct should sound more pure than any JI scale...yet it does not sound so good to my ears.&nbsp; And so started my train of thought &quot;let&apos;s try looking beyond the harmonic series...&quot;</p><p>&gt;&quot;I read more of this list than almost anyone, I suspect.<br/>But even I can&apos;t read it all.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp; And that&apos;s understandable...the only thing I didn&apos;t understand is why you suddenly jumped into this discussion making very very strong statements...as if you had been there watching the whole thing.</p><p>&gt;&quot;It shows that successive cuts of phi will eventually get<br/>you octaves.&quot;<br/>Correct...</p><p>&gt;&quot;The significance of this isn&apos;t clear.&quot;<br/>&quot;...but, OK, interesting.

Musically... feasible?</p><p>&gt;It was at least enough, for example, to get Rick to build his<br/>&gt;own PHI scale based on 36TET which, I agree, really is based<br/>&gt;truly on the PHI-tave (unlike most so-called PHI scales<br/>&gt;in history).</p><p>Cool.  Means nothing in terms of music theory, but it&apos;s cool.</p><p>&gt; That and, they both appear to have taken very well to how music<br/>&gt; based on my theories actually sounds (which is the end goal of<br/>&gt; any promising music theory, no matter how mathematically clever,<br/>&gt; no?)</p><p>No.  I can make good-sounding music with a djembe.  It doesn&apos;t<br/>even produce pitched sounds.  So obviously, intonation theory<br/>has a poor correlation with good-sounding music.</p><p>&gt;However, I do wish, in general, you regularly gave me more<br/>&gt;credit for the huge amounts of time I put into developing these<br/>&gt;scales.</p><p>Anyone can develop scales.  I&apos;m glad you&apos;re interested and it&apos;s<br/>a great thing that you&apos;re sharing your work.  Keep it up.<br/>But like many in tuning (including myself at various points<br/>in the past), you seem to have a greatly inflated view of the<br/>significance of your work.</p><p>&gt;A recent comment on this scale said something like &quot;2^(1/PHI)<br/>&gt;would work because it&apos;s logarithmic...but I don&apos;t see how<br/>&gt;(1/PHI)^x would work because it&apos;s additive and the ear works<br/>&gt;exponentially&quot;...which is a fair criticism plus ties directly</p><p>Who said that?  It makes no sense, because the ear doesn&apos;t<br/>&quot;work exponentially&quot;.</p><p>&gt;please at least give me credit for the fact I build these<br/>&gt;constructs very carefully and &gt;not&lt; at all randomly, even if<br/>&gt;you don&apos;t agree with the goals I build them to reach.</p><p>I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever accused you of building scales<br/>randomly!  I know you write software (and I tried your<br/>javascript page) and so on and so forth.

I think you were referring to Steve&apos;s last post which said:<br/>&quot;AKJ&apos;s method, using 2^p (where p=0.618, or a Fibonacci-number approximation to it) is in fact splitting the octave geometrically (rather than arithmetically) and it seems to me to be the closest aural analogy to the visual splitting of a line segment.&quot;</p><p>I don&apos;t know who AKJ is or whether Steve&apos;s comment is truly representative, but this is some very faulty logic. Because exponentials are added, this seems at face value to be interesting. eg (2^phi) x 2 = 2^(phi+1) = 2^(phi squared), or taking lower 8ve and dividing 2 gives -1 in exponent. But whoever thought of this &quot;method&quot; answer me this: given 2^(1/phi), then we reach the octave at (2^(1/phi))^phi = 2. How on earth are we supposed to have a phi number of frequencies/notes within an octave? Perhaps we can cut down a piano string and call it (1/phi)&apos;th of an entire frequency! THIS is why the exponents cannot be irrational, only the resultant frequencies can be irrational. Besides, there is a great deal of difference b/w 2^(1/phi) and phi. It is like saying that 2^3 = 8 can somehow substitute the number 3.</p><p>-Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;If you enforce the somewhat artificial restriction that all<br/>&gt; tones have to be in a single octave, then there are triads<br/>&gt; more consonant than any tetrad, tetrads more consonant than<br/>&gt; any pentad, &quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   Of course, the less notes (IE the further a sub-set you take) the more consonance in general.  And a subset of my scale is always going to have more consonance than the entire scale played at once.  But the impression I get (so far) is that Just Intonation itself implies certain consonance limits that step from the harmonic series.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   And when I tried the harmonic series based scale 9/8 10/8 11/8 12/8 13/8 14/8 15/8 16/8  18/8 20/8 to make 8-tone per octave chords...I found out that my ears/mind actually objected to having so many tones beating against each other at the same rate (which actually sounds a bit mechanical and forced, even with pure sine waves).  And, if I have it right, such a construct should sound more pure than any JI scale...yet it does not sound so good to my ears.  And so started my train of thought &quot;let&apos;s try looking beyond the harmonic series...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;I read more of this list than almost anyone, I suspect.<br/>&gt; But even I can&apos;t read it all.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   And that&apos;s understandable...the only thing I didn&apos;t understand is why you suddenly jumped into this discussion making very very strong statements...as if you had been there watching the whole thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;It shows that successive cuts of phi will eventually get<br/>&gt; you octaves.&quot;<br/>&gt; Correct...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;The significance of this isn&apos;t clear.&quot;<br/>&gt; &quot;...but, OK, interesting.  So what?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     So far, by ear, I have tested several scales based on fractal numbers.  And, out of the ones I&apos;ve made, those that intersect relatively well with 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 5/1 6/1...virtually always sound more confident/centered.  You said yourself aligning tones with the first six harmonics is a good idea...well, turns out (if I interpreted your point correctly) I agree with you.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;You haven&apos;t described any observations that anyone else seems<br/>&gt; to agree with&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    In what sense?  It baffles me that I can, say, release songs using the Silver Ratio scale which people seem to thing are very good and consonant...and then have them go &quot;uh uh I didn&apos;t say that...the numbers are wrong&quot; when it comes down to my mathematical explanations (such as those above).  Perhaps people&apos;s ears agree with how it works in music, but can&apos;t figure out why the numbers behind it are so weird.<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;, and haven&apos;t shared any models with us either.&quot;<br/>&gt; Models of what exactly?  I told you how I derive the scale from a continuous function, how I mirror certain notes, how the whole process represents how PHI works in architecture, why taking 0.618^x represents a construct with both exponential and additive (IE each number in the scale = the number before it plus the number after it), the intersection of the octave by my scales (without using an existing theory like MOS to do<br/>&gt;  so)...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    It seems to me you are frustrated with me because you can&apos;t find any obvious common ties with existing music theory.  Minus, perhaps, the fact my scale intersects the octave.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;The fact that you continue to fail to understand this is<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; pretty grim if you want to contribute to music theory.&quot;<br/>&gt;   Well then what on earth constitutes being contributing to music theory?  Aren&apos;t my extensive references to psychoacoustics enough?<br/>&gt; Or is a key requirement &quot;references existing literature&quot; (including, perhaps, things like the Noble Mediant which have absolutely nothing to do with the construction of my noble/fractal scale theories)?<br/>&gt;     I realize even &quot;weird tune-iks&quot; like Sethares seem to go back and use parts of there theories to explain &quot;why diatonic JI works&quot; just like Wilson&apos;s MOS explains the construction of pentatonic and diatonic scales.  But, if people like the sound of the tunings in the end of the day...what&apos;s so wrong about making something without a huge deal of references to existing music theory?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Chris knows at least as much as you about this stuff, but<br/>&gt; compare his attitude and the frequency and content of his<br/>&gt; posts.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Chris obviously knows more about formal music theory (he&apos;s fully degreed)...but I wouldn&apos;t go so far as to say he knows more about things like Psychoacoustics proportionate beating (which are the main thrusts of my scales).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;What do you think it is that Rick and Chris understand?&quot;<br/>&gt;     Well one main thing they seem to get...is that the PHI-tave has<br/>&gt; emotional significance relative to all other tones, just like the octave and 5th do.  They may disagree with certain things I do beyond the chord<br/>&gt; 1/PHI 1 PHI/2 PHI...but they at least appear to agree things based directly on the PHI-tave are both unique and musically thesible.  It was at least enough, for example, to get Rick to build his own PHI scale based on 36TET which, I agree, really is based truly on the PHI-tave (unlike most so-called PHI scales in history).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     That and, they both appear to have taken very well<br/>&gt;  to how music based on my theories actually sounds (which is the end goal of any promising music theory, no matter how mathematically clever, no?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;I was wrong about phi and octaves, and I&apos;m sorry about that.&quot;<br/>&gt;    Thank you, and I&apos;m not going to hold a grudge on that I think we can both acknowledge such grudges don&apos;t help us any with progress on creating scales. :-)<br/>&gt;  . However, I do wish, in general, you regularly gave me more credit for the huge amounts of time I put into developing these scales.  You have the right to think I am a bit nuts for trying (hahaha)...  A recent comment on this scale said something like &quot;2^(1/PHI) would work because it&apos;s logarithmic...but I don&apos;t see how (1/PHI)^x would work because it&apos;s additive and the ear works exponentially&quot;...which is a fair criticism plus ties directly to psychoacoustics (an issue fundamental to why I created the scale), but it certainly didn&apos;t say anything<br/>&gt;  horridly assuming like (paraphrased) &quot;so it&apos;s obvious you just picked random numbers and used (1/PHI)^x to approximate them&quot;.  My point is, in general, please at least give me credit for the fact I build these constructs very carefully and &gt;not&lt; at all randomly, even if you don&apos;t agree with the goals I build them to reach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Michael<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=83431 href="#83431">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2009 11:19:28 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok Carl,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve been there and done that....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This was a live performance recorded 1891-ish on cassette - just a touch of<br/>&gt; noise reduction after digitalization.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/random-interval-challenge">http://clones.soonlabel.com/public/micro/random-interval-challenge</a><br/>&gt; /tf-excerpt.mp3<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; your challenge is to tell us the instrument - and any other<br/>&gt; particulars - one clue - it was performed outside.</p><p>I give.

When you turn the volume on and off from a signal in<br/>a sinusoidal fashion you create a form of &quot;beating&quot;, and it doesn&apos;t<br/>seem to lead to any observable phenomenon even close to something like<br/>the perception of a &quot;chord quality&quot; or a &quot;tonal color.&quot;</p><p>Nonetheless, I can&apos;t ignore the simple fact that your phi scale does<br/>sound great. Is it that you&apos;re taking equal divisions of phi and using<br/>that as a period instead of 2/1? If so, I think the unique sound that<br/>it has stems from the fact the phi ratio itself is extremely high<br/>entropy, but when you stack a bunch of copies of phi on top of each<br/>other you eventually come close to familiar small-integer ratios.</p><p>I do notice that it does seem to have a lot of maximally different<br/>&quot;tone colors&quot; as you mentioned above, or tone chroma, as I prefer to<br/>call it - I think it&apos;s due to that characteristic of it mentioned<br/>above. The pattern I notice is that the farther harmonically &quot;out&quot; you<br/>get from a tone, the more the tone chroma changes. Like how 3/2 has a<br/>pretty close chroma to 1/1. And you can&apos;t get much farther out from<br/>1/1 than phi, after all.</p><p>But it is an interesting concept. A lot scales talked about here work<br/>from the other way around - a consonant interval, such as some kind of<br/>a fifth, will be used as a generator that when stacked on top of<br/>itself enough will approximate more complex and dissonant intervals.<br/>The fact that this scale uses the opposite approach is something I<br/>especially like. Perhaps the fact that the period itself is so<br/>dissonant has something to do with it as well.</p><p>-Mike</p><p>On Thu, Apr 30, 2009 at 12:09 AM,  &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris.<br/>&gt; I made a mistake with my PHI scale...once of the notes (at about 443.17<br/>&gt; cents) was a mis-copy and sound dissonant vs. virtually any other note in<br/>&gt; the scale. :-(<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll re-do the PHI scale tomorrow and re-send you the scala file, in the<br/>&gt; mean-time, trying listening to this<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.geocities.com/djtrancendance/PHI/phicicles.mp3">http://www.geocities.com/djtrancendance/PHI/phicicles.mp3</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was made with my PHI-scale, minus the sour note mentioned above.

That means<br/>that as your brain tries to lock the &quot;phi&quot; interval in and figure out<br/>what it is, it&apos;s going to be interpreted as being as far from both 1/1<br/>and 2/1 as possible.</p><p>Remember how I mentioned that 1/1 and 2/1 (and 4/1, and 8/1, and so<br/>on) are all going to have the same chroma? Well, the metastable<br/>interval approach would dictate that the phi interval is as<br/>harmonically far from being interpreted as 1/1 and 2/1 as possible.<br/>This logically means that the phi interval is also going to have as<br/>&quot;different&quot; a tone chroma as possible from your starting note. So<br/>according to that theory, it means that if 1/1 is C, phi times C is<br/>going to have the &quot;polar opposite&quot; chroma. This is actually one of the<br/>properties of this scale that I like, and why I said that I thought it<br/>was exceptionally &quot;colorful&quot; - I&apos;m hearing different pitch colors all<br/>over the place. The first scale of yours sounded a bit more colorful<br/>though - what were the specifications for it?</p><p>Keep in mind though that from an AP standpoint, chroma is such a<br/>strange and understudied concept for me that I&apos;m not sure if<br/>metastable ratios can really apply to chroma labels just like that.<br/>Chroma perception, from my observations, seems to be highly, highly<br/>listener dependent; much more so than fundamental placement. It&apos;s also<br/>an unresolved question at least for me what part of the overall<br/>&quot;chroma&quot; perception is the fundamental percept and what parts are<br/>rather rooted in associations from psychological pitch categories.<br/>Nonetheless, that&apos;s the idea behind why the metastable concept applies<br/>particularly to the phi scale.</p><p>Keep in mind that this only applies to two note dyads. As of right<br/>now, we don&apos;t have HE curves for triads or tetrads or anything more<br/>than two-note chords. As you stated earlier, if you play an entire<br/>harmonic series and replace 13 with phi, which is 7 cents flat, I<br/>would be extremely surprised if the timbre didn&apos;t &quot;fuse&quot; nonetheless.</p><p>It is certainly possible that in this new system of tonality you&apos;re<br/>creating, certain properties of the scale would lead to you hearing<br/>notes a phi ratio apart as being &quot;equivalent&quot; in some sense. What is<br/>likely is that the scale structure repeating at phi is an easily<br/>recognizable pattern that leads to some perceptual nature of<br/>&quot;equivalence,&quot; although it&apos;s not the same type of equivalence as 2/1<br/>chroma equivalence.</p><p>I recommend you read the metastable ratio paper, it&apos;s quite an<br/>interesting read.

And, if he&apos;d asked me directly to re-post the scale again or asked which version of the scale I used, you bet I would answer quickly with a copy of the new scale printed in my reply.</p><p>   Also, for the record I am very busy working on a mathematical proof that goes deep into psychoacoustics.  It turns out no harmonic (meaning 1-times, 2-times, 3-times) are root note of my scales is either<br/>1) more than the ratio 1.013 away from the nearest root note on a higher period<br/>OR<br/>2) less than the ratio 1.05 away from the nearest root note on a higher period</p><p>  For example, one of the notes in my PHI scale is 1.23606, which times 3 (third overtone) is 3.70821...which is very near 3.72 (another note on a higher octave of the PHI scale).   Meanwhile 1.09017 (on the PHI scale) * 3 = 3.4377, which is right in between the notes 3.25 and 3.72 on a higher octave in the PHI scale (and 3.4377 / 3.25 = 1.0577...far enough away to stop violent beating).</p><p>  So...the way that harmonics either hit the notes dead-on or slip right in-between them is an obvious example of mathematically why the funky noble numbered scales exhibit consonance in the traditional sense of the word.  The way tones exclusively fit either very very closely (chorus-like effect) or fairly far away (eliminating beating for the most part) goes hand-in-hand with Sethares&apos; consonance curves.</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>   Does that sort of thing count as a psycho-acoustic explanation...or what else is missing?<br/>&lt;&lt;</p><p>   Far as explaining &quot;proportionate beating&quot;...there are too many other theories about noble numbered scales that having nothing to do with the pleasant-ness of beating.

I was NOT using phi as an acoustic ratio....so I&apos;m talking about approximations with edos to the interval corresponding to &quot;1/phi octaves (~0.618 octaves)&quot;, or 741.64078649987357 cents, and not phi itself, which is 833.09029635674085 cents. The 741.64 cent interval, or it&apos;s nearest approximation in an appropriate edo is then used as a generator, where the period is the good ol&apos; octave.</p><p>The &apos;justification&apos;, should one need it, is that the octave is THE established interval of equivalence to the ear, and thus metaphorically serves as a &apos;unit circle&apos; with which we can explore angles. Form a phyllotaxic point-of-view, the way certain plants use the &apos;golden angle&apos;, or 2PI/phi radians, or ~0.618*360 degrees, as an angular &apos;generator&apos; is interesting in the way that it maximizes the amount of sunlight the various layers of the plant can receive. By analogy, one would expect that the &apos;spectral space&apos; of the octave would also be so divide as to give a kind of maximal richness or complexity...</p><p>Now, since Phi itself is approximated by neighboring terms of the Fibonacci sequence in ratio form, it stands to reason that it can be approximated by higher and higher numbered &quot;Fibonacci edos&quot; (8,13,21,34,55 etc.). If &apos;n&apos; is a Fibonnaci number representing an edo, pick the &apos;n-1&apos; Fibonacci number as an index to use as a generator. You will find that this pattern forms MOS scales, the number of notes in the MOS scale always being itself a Fibonnacci number.</p><p>So, for instance, 34-edo using 21deg34 as a generator, we have a MOS scale when we get to 8 notes, 13 notes, etc...I agree with Michael that 8 is a nice, medium size scale--not too small to be uninteresting, not too large to be unweildy, chaotic, or hard to grasp in its totality.</p><p>Now, mind you, I think one&apos;s milage with this scale depends on the timbre...good for inharmonic spectra like gongs, FM inharmonic patches, samples of kitchen pots and pans, or in general, any timbre which has a decay on the order of 1 second or less. Then the scale will have an appealing &apos;alien otherness&apos;...but I wouldn&apos;t recommend sustaining big chords on a church organ or hammond organ or string sound or fat sawtooth synth sound, unless you are using it as a torture technique at Gitmo.</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;martinsj013&quot; &lt;martinsj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;rick_ballan&quot; &lt;rick_ballan@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I think you were referring to Steve&apos;s last post which said:<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;AKJ&apos;s method, using 2^p (where p=0.618, or a Fibonacci-number approximation to it) is in fact splitting the octave geometrically (rather than arithmetically) and it seems to me to be the closest aural analogy to the visual splitting of a line segment.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know who AKJ is or whether Steve&apos;s comment is truly representative, but this is some very faulty logic. ... whoever thought of this &quot;method&quot; answer me this: given 2^(1/phi), then we reach the octave at (2^(1/phi))^phi = 2.

I tried your logarithmic PHI scale.  With pure sound waves (IE sine tones) it actually sounds absolutely beautiful consonant and well ordered/symmetric...but with any sort of harmonic timbre you get tones of overtones clashing within a 1.016-1.049 ratio of the nearest tone/harmonic (hence horrific dissonance with normal harmonic timbre instrument).

Aaron&apos;s scale uses 21/34 as an approximation to 1/PHI, but instead of using that as a frequency ratio, it uses 2^(21/34) to divide the octave into two unequal intervals, according to the golden section (approximately).  Neither of the two intervals is 1:PHI though.</p><p>I have a further explanation in mind but no time to type it now - will try tomorrow.</p><p>Regards,<br/>Steve M.</p></div>
