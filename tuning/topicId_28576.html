I remember reading an interview with<br/>jazz great Barney Kessel once, and he said (paraphrasing, of course)<br/>that none of the great jazz musicians he had met head learned their art<br/>in schools/conservatories...quite true, I believe. I do, indeed, think<br/>that true creativity is a gift, from the Universe/Creator, and I&apos;m not<br/>sure how or why one person gets it, and another one doesn&apos;t. You<br/>(meaning anyone) can study and practice all you want, all your life, you<br/>can have monster chops and technique, whatever...but, you may never have<br/>that gift, that spark, that a true creative genius has/had. And, of<br/>course, many creative folks DID study their asses off, worked very hard,<br/>to achieve the fulfillment of their gift, no doubt about it. But,<br/>without the inherent gift in the first place, all that study doesn&apos;t<br/>mean much...that&apos;s why art is not science; it&apos;s mysterious, awesome, and<br/>unforgettable when it happens. But, if PWizard doesn&apos;t think he&apos;s<br/>rarely, if ever, heard any truly creative music, then I truly feel sorry<br/>for him...maybe his standards are quite high (as they should be), or<br/>maybe something else. I have heard, and continue to hear, much great<br/>art, including many folks from this here forum, folks who continue to<br/>inspire me, and open my heart to unknown realms, folks who hear the<br/>unknown, and try to translate it into musical statements. And, I also<br/>agree with Dante...I would be delighted to hear PWizard&apos;s version of<br/>true creativity...perhaps he&apos;s &quot;got&quot; it...if so, please share it with<br/>the rest of us, as I am always looking for &quot;it,&quot; and would be happy to<br/>add PW&apos;s version of great art to the huge stack of great artists which I<br/>am constantly listening to, and attempting to learn, from...Hstick</p></div>
