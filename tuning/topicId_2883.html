However today we can produce by electronic means any waveform<br/>that we want and so there is no need to make compromises at all (unless<br/>of course you happen to play a guitar or other fixed tuned instrument).<br/>There is no additional cost to having an infinite variety of notes<br/>available than the one time effort of programming a computer, a small<br/>price to pay for producing music that speaks the composer&apos;s intentions<br/>without any compromise at all.</p><p>There are a variety of factors that will come into such an effort.<br/>Some people argue that slightly imperfect tuning adds a tension to a<br/>chord whereas the perfect chord may sound a bit dull.  This may be so,<br/>but I would argue that this is a separate factor that should always be<br/>controlled by choice rather than by chance and that there are additional<br/>factors involved which should also be considered.</p><p>The most important additional factor is that of the beats between notes.<br/>With any form of ET scale, no matter how many notes in it, the beats<br/>between notes are not related to the key in a meaningful way but rather<br/>are generally quite discordant.  However with JI the beats are always<br/>other notes of the scale, and if variations in frequency are to be added<br/>for tension then consideration should be given to how the beats fall<br/>with respect to the scale.  This must be done for every case.  As an<br/>example, the 7th interval is quite ugly in normal 12-TET but in 8:15 JI<br/>is a quite acceptable chord.</p><p>Another factor which should be considered at some point is the key of a<br/>piece in relation to the tempo of the piece.  Many great works of music<br/>have a tempo (considered as an oscillation rate) which is &quot;in tune&quot; with<br/>the key of the piece.  Of course tempo varies in pieces so this may be<br/>taken to mean the typical tempo.  Also, variations in tempo will<br/>themselves therefore tend to be by ratios which are musical ratios.</p><p>Again, to achieve the best results the frequencies used should be<br/>related to the natural world, which includes the consequences on the<br/>human body, the relationship to the building in which it is being played<br/>and even to the whole earth resonances.  This may seem fanciful, but in<br/>the end the instrument that is being played is the human body and mind<br/>and to play it most successfully requires understanding its origins and<br/>resonances.</p><p>How then is such a grand scheme to be implemented?  It will certainly<br/>require an intelligent computer program between the keyboard and the<br/>sound production, assuming that a keyboard is used.  It might equally<br/>apply to music played from a score as to keyboard input and perhaps it<br/>would be most logical to consider it as a device between a MIDI stream<br/>of notes and the actual sound production.</p><p>The general idea of this I call AJI for Automatic Just Intonation and I<br/>discuss it at <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/aji-main.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/aji-main.htm</a> and<br/>include several examples of the frequencies played for each note in the<br/>example pieces.  In essence the idea is to recognise that if the notes<br/>played are, for example, C-E-G then the frequency ratios should be<br/>exactly 4:5:6 and so to do that.  I ignore for the moment the question<br/>of deliberate tension requirements by slight variations in frequency<br/>which can be addressed later.</p><p>The determination of the ratios of a particular chord is a relatively<br/>easy matter, as see <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/aji-a.gif">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/aji-a.gif</a> which<br/>is a simple &quot;slide rule&quot; for determining for any combination of notes<br/>what the underlying ratios that should be used are.  Actually there are<br/>a couple of complications, but this works in most cases.  However a<br/>piece of music is not a series of isolated chords but a whole which<br/>flows along.  As such, the previous notes and chords need to be<br/>considered, particularly in some ambiguous cases where two or even more<br/>possible harmonic intentions need to be considered.</p><p>I will suggest that there is a &quot;natural tuning&quot; which works best and<br/>that it is not based on A=440 Hz but a slightly higher value of ~450 Hz.<br/>I have come to this conclusion based on three quite separate pieces of<br/>evidence which I will not go into here.  There is some discussion at<br/><a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/alex-ha.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/alex-ha.htm</a> that touches on some of<br/>these points.  Tempo also will naturally follow to have certain discrete<br/>values that are favoured in use.</p><p>The most common frequencies for the notes sould be these:</p><p>        D     A     E<br/>       600   450   675</p><p>     Bb    F     C     G<br/>    480   360   540   405</p><p>The above values are equal to the Earth&apos;s Schumann resonance (the<br/>natural earth electromagnetic oscillation) multiplied by the JI ratios<br/>of 24:27:30:32:36:40:45 and are therefore natural strong resonances.</p><p>These are arranged so that there are exact ratios of 3 horizontally and<br/>of 5 diagonally up to the right with all notes being reduced by ratios<br/>of 2 to a common octave.  Of course if we shift key by modulation then<br/>we arrive at a new scale such as:</p><p>        A     E     B<br/>       450   675   506.25</p><p>     F     C     G     D<br/>    360   540   405   607.5</p><p>And in so doing we discover that D has changed from 600 Hz to 607.5 Hz.<br/>Such changes by a ratio of 80:81 are well known and we need to recognise<br/>that in a single piece of music sometimes D means one of these and<br/>sometimes the other.  No compromise can deal with the fact that these<br/>are two separate notes which are only confused because of our inadequate<br/>notation.  In Indian music these are clearly recognised as different<br/>notes and played as such.</p><p>In playing a piece of music in the key of F say, if we play Bb-D-F then<br/>D must be 600 Hz to harmonise properly while in the chord G-B-D it must<br/>be 607.5 Hz.</p><p>I will close by mentioning that when exact harmonics are not played (for<br/>reasons of &quot;interest&quot;) then the beats should be designed to fit with the<br/>scale and the rhythm.  For example, suppose we wanted to play Bb-F in<br/>the above tuning but wanted some tension then we would want to vary from<br/>the exact 240 Hz and 360 Hz frequencies.  In so doing a good variation<br/>would be by 3.75 Hz as that (as the beats that will be generated) is in<br/>tune with the notes themselves and hopefully also in keeping with the<br/>rhythm which might be say 112.5 BPM or 1.875 Hz.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div><h3>Rosati &#x3C;dante@xxx.xxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>5/11/1999 5:36:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The Schuman resonance is constantly shifting so unless you have some<br/>detector hooked to your automatic intonation weegee the supposed resonance<br/>will be more fanciful than actual.</p><p>There&apos;s no right and wrong in art, just &quot;play&quot;, and things that make you go<br/>&quot;oooo&quot; and things that leave you cold.

Start performances by adjusting his<br/>&gt; &gt;base pitch to the resonance of the room except to the earth. Serialism is<br/>&gt; &gt;worth exploring and might teach us something but natural resonance is some<br/>&gt; wee<br/>&gt; &gt;gee hocus-pocus. Is it your academia that&apos;s showing.:)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I never said serialism might teach us something, you must be mixing me up<br/>&gt; with someones else&apos;s post.</p><p>You at least take it seriously and unbiased</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve got nothing against the idea of resonance<br/>&gt; but if you&apos;re going to do it you might as well try to make it a real<br/>&gt; resonance rather than an imaginary one.</p><p>Is ET real or imaginary? Is what Academics teach real or imaginary?</p><p>&gt; &gt;&gt; There&apos;s no such thing as &quot;perfect<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; tuning&quot;, just various tunings that you like to compose in/play in or not.</p><p>Perfect, no. more complete yes!<br/>It&apos;s easy to accept any tuning for brief periods of time. Especially if you<br/>switch from one to the other. I would like to see people stick to one for a<br/>couple years and explore it fully and then see where it leads. When I first<br/>started working in tuning I began with 31 ET for many of the same reasons<br/>people work with any ET. After a couple of years I couldn&apos;t stand not having a<br/>9/8 or 9/8 like interval. This could only come about by using the tuning for a<br/>period of time exclusively. Paul Erlich at least is taken the time to examine<br/>where his logic has lead him and he might change and he might not. At these it<br/>isn&apos;t the flippant jump from one tuning to another. You not going to convince<br/>me that we can absorb a tuning that quickly. So the idea of using &quot;what turns<br/>you on&quot; is not so simple</p><p>&gt; &gt;Sterns arguments that nothing can said about any tuning be apriori might be<br/>&gt; &gt;the best Philosophical stand in many ways. But there is some inner musical<br/>&gt; &gt;reality that history (my academia showing:)) and transcultural surveys show<br/>&gt; &gt;are  preferred by human beings.<br/>&gt; &gt;There is something that make people prefer steps between frequencies,<br/>&gt; melodies<br/>&gt; &gt;in general, 5 and 7 tone scales over 6,8,or 9 tone scales. Human beings are<br/>&gt; &gt;not objective data consuming machine who have no natural preference. To<br/>&gt; think<br/>&gt; &gt;so one would have to except Psychology as False if not impossible. All<br/>&gt; tunings<br/>&gt; &gt;are not Created Equal!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While it is true that there are cross cultural tendencies like the ones you<br/>&gt; point out, that does not mean that experiments that go beyond these are<br/>&gt; pointless.</p><p>I agree. there are cultures where the elements I mentioned are not the<br/>predominant ones.</p><p>&gt; It might also be observed that there are transcultural<br/>&gt; tendencies to violence, war and exploitation of one group by another.<br/>&gt; &quot;Natural&quot; does not necessarily equal &quot;better&quot;.</p><p>It&apos;s better to face them head on at least. If they are lets examine it not run<br/>away in some arbitrary manner. The whole western idea of going outside of<br/>what&apos;s here (SKY GOD MENTALITIES) might benefit more from going in deeper<br/>(Earth Goddess) into what us here. Psychology will inform you that if these<br/>qualities are natural you are not going to get away from it with reason. The<br/>french Revolution was the most intellectual and also the bloodiest. If anything<br/>Hitler was attempting to &quot;correct &quot; nature by purging the defective gene pool.<br/>Science has once again brought us to the same place. No transcendence of nature<br/>is desirable until you know what nature is! Run away from the harmonic series<br/>and it will come back to bite you on the ass!</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I just get a little skeptical when I read claims that one or another tuning<br/>&gt; system is &quot;better&quot; or the &quot;one true tuning&quot;.

Firstly that means getting a good JI by<br/>default and then looking at when and what variations from that are<br/>desired and specifying them.</p><p>And just a note about spelling (for which I got criticised by several<br/>people).  I happen to come from a part of the world where we spell words<br/>in English rather than American so I write things like &quot;colour&quot; and<br/>&quot;centre&quot; and I don&apos;t intend to be AmericaniZed.  Other than that I am a<br/>crappy speller but sometimes I hit the spell check button and save you<br/>all from some of them.</p><p>Also, a short note to Alex Vanwey and his 13 limit notation.<br/>Certainly a notation is needed that is definitive.  A good one appears<br/>in the book &quot;An Introduction to Indian Music&quot; by E Clements (1912) which<br/>in addition to &quot;b&quot; and &quot;#&quot; uses &quot;+&quot;, &quot;*&quot; and a &quot;b&quot; that looks like a<br/>vertical line with a 7 written on it.  This last one is brilliant<br/>because he uses it for the 7 ratio notes.</p><p>If you are going to use day names for the notes, why not make a meal of<br/>it.  The natural can be lunch with sharp and flat being dinner and<br/>breakfast.  Then you can have morning and afternoon tea (OK coffee for<br/>Americans), supper and brunch.  Those ones that really fall in the<br/>cracks (like 11 and 13) can be midnight snacks.   :-)</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div><h3>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>5/12/1999 9:27:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Kraig Grady, TD 177.15]<br/>&gt; I understand the wandering tonic but not the 6 added ninth<br/>&gt; thing please explain.</p><p>There was a discussion on the List between Paul Erlich and<br/>I last year about this:</p><p>[Paul Erlich, Mills TD 1400.3, 29 Apr 1998]<br/>&gt; [Example] 3.  6/9 (meaning root, maj. 3rd, perf. 5th. maj. 6th, maj.<br/>9th)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here, we have a chain of 5ths, but also a major 3rd and two minor<br/>&gt; thirds.

Chords with four or more successive fifths, such as C-D-F-G.</p><p>Most likely treat all the fifths as 3/2 ratios to get 8:12:18:27, but<br/>context could change that as could the inversion of the chord.  In the<br/>arrangement that you give it would most likely be 24:27:32:36 but<br/>16:18:21:24 or 18:20:24:27 or even 27:30:36:40 are possible depending on<br/>what came before (what key in other words).  In C use 24:27:32:36.</p><p>&gt;These all require compromises of some sort, don&apos;t they?</p><p>Yes, but in the thinking or understanding rather than in the<br/>frequencies.  These chords are difficult to understand the meaning of no<br/>matter what tuning system is used.  It is much easier to answer<br/>definitively when the full context is clear as in the first example.<br/>Music is all about the relationships, not just within the chord, but<br/>also between chords and so we must expect that context is going to alter<br/>things.  This is an advantage, not a disadvantage.</p><p>Even if some of these chords do sound a bit weird, they would sound<br/>equally weird in ET.  Anyone who writes chords like that clearly wants<br/>to get that sort of effect.

But<br/>&gt;&gt;there are problem chords and sequences of chords.  For example, what<br/>&gt;&gt;would you do when tuning:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;   . The infamous comma-pump chord sequence, I-vi-ii-V-I, with tied<br/>&gt;&gt;     notes whenever possible.</p><p>[Ray Tomes wrote:]<br/>&gt; I would play a different note (*81/80) for the common note in the ii<br/>&gt; and V chords and therefore return to the original chord.</p><p>OK.

The transition from G-B-D-F to G-C-F, with the outer notes tied.</p><p>&gt; It depends on the context.</p><p>OK, fair enough.</p><p>&gt; If this was the start of a piece then the G-B-D-F would be 4:5:6:7 and<br/>&gt; C would be 16/3 with no changes to G and F.  However I have just<br/>&gt; conceded that 4:5:6:7 is not the only possibility as I had previously<br/>&gt; maintained.</p><p>And I, ironically, jumped to the defense of 4:5:6:7.  To my ear, it&apos;s<br/>got the most, no contest!</p><p>&gt;&gt;   . An augmented triad: C-E-G#.</p><p>&gt; Again it depends on context, only more so.</p><p>Fair enough.</p><p>&gt;&gt;   . A full diminished triad: A-C-Eb-Gb.</p><p>&gt; Likewise.</p><p>&gt;&gt;   . Chords with four or more successive fifths, such as C-D-F-G.</p><p>&gt; Most likely treat all the fifths as 3/2 ratios to get 8:12:18:27, but<br/>&gt; context could change that as could the inversion of the chord.</p><p>Here I definitely prefer 12-tET, that much-maligned (rightly so most<br/>of the time!) tuning.</p><p>&gt;&gt;These all require compromises of some sort, don&apos;t they?</p><p>&gt; Yes, but in the thinking or understanding rather than in the<br/>&gt; frequencies.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>&gt; These chords are difficult to understand the meaning of no matter what<br/>&gt; tuning system is used.</p><p>I agree.</p><p>&gt; Even if some of these chords do sound a bit weird, they would sound<br/>&gt; equally weird in ET.  Anyone who writes chords like that clearly wants<br/>&gt; to get that sort of effect.  The vast majority of chords would be<br/>&gt; improved and I don&apos;t think that any would be made worse, but I am<br/>&gt; prepared to be proved wrong on that.</p><p>Right now I like 12-tET for my last 3 examples, but, as you say, an<br/>individual composer might want a different effect.</p><p>It seems very clear that many chords, and many sequences of notes,<br/>cannot satisfy all desired tuning &quot;requirements&quot;, and so by my use of<br/>the word, there MUST be &quot;compromise&quot;.

But it wasn&apos;t terribly convincing. Paul&apos;s<br/>example of the 6-9 chord is better (smaller errors), and as Kraig Grady and<br/>Joe Monzo pointed out &quot;who says they have to be consonances&quot;.</p><p>But assuming in the case of the 6-9 chord, that they are, here&apos;s how the<br/>errors distribute in two different tunings.</p><p>6-9 chord   Errors when in     Errors when in<br/>C E G A D   Pythagorean        1/4 comma Meantone<br/>4 5 6   9   +21.5c in 4:5      -5.4c in 4:6, 5:6, 6:9<br/>3     5     +21.5c)            +5.4c<br/>  3   4                        +5.4c<br/>    8 9                       -10.8c<br/>      3 4                      +5.4c</p><p>The errors in 12-tET will be somewhere in between, but closer to those in<br/>Pythagorean. Clearly meantone is better for this chord than 12-tET, but<br/>31-tET or some meantone a little closer to 1/5 comma (and hence closer to<br/>12-tET) would be kinder to the 8:9 (with something like 8c max errors).</p><p>Here&apos;s what might be an even better example (lower errors when<br/>distributed), a CC interpretation of the diminished 7th chord.</p><p>dim 7th     Errors when        Errors when in<br/>C EbF#A     5:6:7 is just      1/4 comma Meantone<br/>5 6 7                          -5.4c in 5:6, +2.3c in 6:7, -3.1c in 5:7<br/>3     5     +13.8c             +5.4c<br/>    5 6                        -5.4c<br/>  5   7                        -3.1c</p><p>Something a little closer to 1/3 comma would get the max error down to 4.6c.</p><p>Of course Ray, you have said that the 6/9 chord should be tuned<br/>12:15:18:20:27 and will say the dim7 should be 10:12:14:17, but whether you<br/>agree that the above CC&apos;s are _the_ 6-9 or dim7 chords, the point is that<br/>chords do exist which obtain their greatest consonance in an irrational<br/>temperament, not in any kind of Just scale.</p><p>Or putting it another way: These chords may have a dissonance minimum in a<br/>harmonic series subset, but they have another dissonance minimum (which may<br/>be even lower) in some (irrational) temperament.</p><p>Can someone easily compare these chords in meantone CC versus harmonic<br/>series and give us an opinion on relative consonance, or whether they sound<br/>like completely different chords?</p><p>Now that I think about it, the 6-9 chord seems a better counterexample to<br/>your thesis, than the dim7, because of its higher numbers when given as a<br/>harmonic series subset.</p><p>Note that your slide-rule predicted 10:13:15:17:22or23 and<br/>11:14:17:19:25or26 before the more reasonable 12:15:18:20:27 for the 6-9<br/>chord, unless we agree to leave off the primes above 7 as you suggest in<br/>your article on your website.</p><p>Do you see that leaving off those primes is just another way of saying that<br/>sometimes, having simple ratios between _pairs_ of notes in the chord is<br/>more important than having small numbers (or even whole numbers) for the<br/>chord as a whole.</p><p>Paul also mentioned the augmented chord which has a CC interpretation as:</p><p>Aug<br/>C E G#<br/>4 5<br/>  4 5<br/>5   8</p><p>This is optimally tuned in 12-tET with 13.7c errors all round.</p><p>Your slide rule predicts successively 7:9:11, 8:10:13, 10:13:16 11:14:18,<br/>12:15:19, 13:16:20. Leaving off primes above 7 doesn&apos;t help here. We end up<br/>at 14:18:22 which reduces to 7:9:11. I think the above CC is more consonant<br/>than a 7:9:11, but I also think they are quite different chords.</p><p>In fact 7:9:11 is better approximated in 12-tET by a major triad than an<br/>augmented (but not very well by either). This just shows up the fact that<br/>12-tET is inconsistent at the 11-limit. Which is why your slide rule, as it<br/>stands, wont work in general for mutiples of 11 or higher primes. An 11<br/>corresponding to F will sometimes give a better result than F#, likewise 13<br/>being either Ab or A.</p><p>The harmonic slide-rule is a great educational and reference tool, but what<br/>you need to do is put the harmonics at the correct positions, not at the<br/>nearest degrees of 12-tET. Then you can see not only _what_ matches, but<br/>_how_well_ it matches. And you can use it against other temperaments too.<br/>I&apos;d show the harmonics as thin lines (not the same width as keys). This<br/>also eliminates any dilemmas over 22 vs 23 etc. and you could take it up to<br/>the 32nd harmonic or further.</p><p>Of course this doesn&apos;t help your table-scanning adaptive JI algorithm since<br/>it can&apos;t do the equivalent of a continuous slide. However it might be<br/>improved by using 72-tET as the template. i.e. expand your table by a<br/>factor of six in size, then look not only for matches to the 72-tET chord<br/>that exactly corresponds to the chord played in 12-tET but also to those<br/>72-tET chords which are slightly different but are closer to the played<br/>12-tET chord than to any other 12-tET chord. Somewhat of a combinatorial<br/>explosion but still tractable. Of course this still doesn&apos;t address CCs or<br/>tonic drift.</p><p>I&apos;m glad you understand tonic drift now.</p><p>[Ray Tomes:]<br/>&gt;... there is another way of preventing too much<br/>&gt;tonic wandering and that is simply to keep pulling the error back by say<br/>&gt;10% per chord played.  That would be almost imperceptible and prevent<br/>&gt;the tonic getting very far from where it started.</p><p>This is exactly what happens in meantone (with no special effort required).<br/>Tonic drift can still happen in adaptive meantone, but not via the common<br/>progressions.</p><p>The augmented and dominant 7th (when considered as contradictory<br/>consonances) are not treated well by meantone, but the 6-9 and dim 7 are.<br/>However I notice Paul Erlich&apos;s comment that in meantone the augmented _can_<br/>be tuned to a different CC with very low errors.</p><p>Aug      Errors when in<br/>C E Ab   1/4 comma meantone<br/>4 5<br/>  7 9    -7.7c<br/>5   8</p><p>Reduces to 2.6c all round, in something a little closer to 1/3 comma.</p><p>Regards,<br/>-- Dave Keenan<br/><a href="http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena">http://uq.net.au/~zzdkeena</a></p></div><h3>rtomes@xxxxx.xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxx)</h3><span>5/13/1999 10:13:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan &lt;<a href="mailto:d.keenan@uq.net.au">d.keenan@uq.net.au</a>&gt; wrote<br/>&gt;... the point is that chords do exist which obtain their greatest<br/>&gt;consonance in an irrational temperament, not in any kind of Just scale.</p><p>That is a marvellously expressed idea which I have never considered<br/>before.

The point is that I don&apos;t care if<br/>there is a 7 ratio which is 30 cents out because my idea is that the<br/>instrument will play the exact correct 7 ratio and so the errors will<br/>always be 0 cents.
