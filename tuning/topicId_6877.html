It was a great night.<br/>Tragically, he died shortly thereafter.</p><p>I believe Kyle Gann is writing a book on Nancarrow...  Gann has transcribed<br/>most of the Nancarrow music for synthesizer.</p><p>I am not certain whether Nancarrow did anything outside of 12-tET.  It&apos;s<br/>possible, but I&apos;m not certain...</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=6892 href="#6892">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;clumma@xxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/12/1999 6:41:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Exile is an extremely personal matter,</p><p>Exile to me means the Federal government had a standing warrant for his<br/>arrest, or perhaps a standing rule that nobody named &quot;Conlon Nancarrow&quot;<br/>should be allowed across the border.
