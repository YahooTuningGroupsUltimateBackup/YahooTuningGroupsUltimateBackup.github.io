(comments best on MMM i would imagine)<br/>   I thought as i was in the process of saving some old work, i would be some files up that might be useful for a couple of reasons.<br/>Done 17 years ago with a retunable Kurzweil keyboard, i apologize for the crudeness of the pieces as it was something i did pretty much on the fly over at a friends house on their equipment and didn&apos;t have much time to tinker with it.<br/>The two pieces reflect my interest in exploring the possibilities inherent in investigating different inversion of the same pitch material.<br/>In this case the 1-3-5-9 hexany which doesn&apos;t really sound much like a hexany due to it being a just major minus the leading tone  and the other being the 7-9-11-15 hexany.<br/>Both pieces were done by figuring out the 720 inversions and extracting the most interesting ones to my ear and placing them in an order that reflected a dissonance curve based on the method i used for a series of lullabies which i think i have stated enough based on adding the numerical value of the harmonics in question in the spacing plus the 1st order difference tones but omitting  any repeated number.</p><p>At the time i thought of this method of writing as being similar to sculpture in that one has a big block of stone (720 inversions) and one whittles away all the unwanted material until what you want is left.<br/>needless to say such a process was very time consuming ( in that i also have placed all the inversions form consonant to dissonant in order before choosing)</p><p>I really don&apos;t like the sounds of MP3s so you will forgive me that i did not include that format also<br/> the first &quot;A Last Look&quot;  was originally done on a small estey organ ( which you can hear in the background) , then different timbres were chosen for lines that likewise moved within the pitches of the exact spacing.<br/>one will hear all 6 tones at any particular time, just the spacing is changed.<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/alastlook.ogg">http://anaphoria.com/alastlook.ogg</a></p><p>the second &quot;Ascension&quot; was done in the same manner and as the synth was only capable of  the 768 resolution per octave, i have never known for sure if the beats and the effects were the result of the tuning or lack of better resolution. hence it marked my end at that time with working with electronics.<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/ascension.ogg">http://anaphoria.com/ascension.ogg</a></p><p>i am sorry to say i cannot find the scores at the moment.</p><p>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
