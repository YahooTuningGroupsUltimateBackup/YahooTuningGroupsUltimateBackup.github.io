The first<br/>octave contains only the fundamental (1) and is the single source of<br/>all. The second octave adds the 5th (2:3), which is the One<br/>hypostatizing and knowing itself. The third octave (4:5:6:7) not only<br/>begins the process of differentiating the space between the One and<br/>its hypostases (5) but also the space that manifestation projects<br/>forward in its return to the One (7). In a musical context, this<br/>octave introduces the chord, not as triad but as &quot;dominant seventh&quot;,<br/>showing that the brothers in the 20th century, in making this chord<br/>the fundamental chord of the blues, have their pulses firmly attuned<br/>to the cosmos. The fourth octave (8-15) I call the &quot;diatonic harmonic<br/>series scale&quot; since its 8 notes is in the realm of our 7 note scale.<br/>The 16 note fifth octave (16-31), I would call the Chromatic Harmonic<br/>Series scale for the same reason.</p><p>This guitar was designed to explore the 4th octave or &quot;diatonic&quot;<br/>harmonic series scale. The strings are tuned to partials 2-3-4-5-6-7<br/>which not only sounds beautiful on its own, but allows for many<br/>different combinations of notes to be reached. For example, the set of<br/>&quot;triads&quot; built on each note of the scale.</p></div>
