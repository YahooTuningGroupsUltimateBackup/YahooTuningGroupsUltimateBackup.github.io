I think it would be helpful to have a common way to refer to these different keyboard layouts, and Erv Wilson&apos;s terminology (as for instance in &quot;Keyboard Schemata from the Scale-Tree&quot;, <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/key.PDF">http://www.anaphoria.com/key.PDF</a>) seems as good as any.</p><p>So for instance, the &quot;2/5 keyboard&quot; has a generator of 2 steps of 5-ET, or 2 steps of a 5-note MOS (which has a pattern of large - small - large - small - small or small - large - small - large - large steps). This could be tuned as a pentatonic D - F - G - Bb - C - D, or as D - Ev - Gv - G# - B - D with alternating 1.5-step and minor third intervals. But alternatively, the generator could be 3 steps of an 8-note MOS (as in a semisixths scale). If you look at the chart on page 2 of Wilson&apos;s paper you can see that the octave is either 2, 3, or 5 rows away from the root (depending on which axis you follow). So you might expect that scales having 2, 3, or 5 steps of one size (and a particular number of steps of a different size) would be most easily adaptable to this keyboard, e.g.</p><p>...E..A..D  diatonic (5+2)<br/>.D..G..C    5 large steps, 2 small steps<br/>..F..Bb</p><p>.E#.G#.B..D    hanson (4+3)<br/>..D..F..Ab.Cb  4 large steps, 3 small steps</p><p>But scales with different numbers of steps are less convenient, such as this 15-note hanson scale (4+11 steps).</p><p>.E..G..Bb.Db<br/>.....E#.G#.B..D<br/>......D..F..Ab.Cb<br/>..........D#.F#.A..C</p><p>So the 2/5 keyboard has a considerable amount of flexibility in the way the key mapping can be assigned, but other keyboard layouts are more convenient for some purposes. For hanson temperament (and others such as myna which share many of the same characteristic MOS scales), a keyboard with the octave four rows away from the root (such as the 2/7 keyboard) would be more appropriate.</p></div><h3><a id=72799 href="#72799">ðŸ”—</a>djwolf_frankfurt &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>8/19/2007 3:25:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>May I point out one additional feature of generalized keyboards?<br/>Because each instance of any harmonic configuration shares the same<br/>fingering (when the generalized keyboard is viewed as wrapping around<br/>itself), or, as Wilson puts it, template, generalized keyboard<br/>mapping is a superb model of both harmonic structures, their<br/>transpositions and inversions, and of voice leading.
