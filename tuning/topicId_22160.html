My wife and I<br/>visited her at Camp Catawba, a stone&apos;s throw from the Blue Ridge<br/>Parkway near Blowing Rock, NC.</p><p>I hadn&apos;t seen Tui in seven years.  She&apos;s now 76, and moving a bit more<br/>slowly, but she&apos;s the same Tui as ever: talented, confident, exacting,<br/>fascinating.</p><p>I told her about the tuning list, and that Johnny Reinhard had mentioned<br/>her name several times.  She laughed and said, &quot;Johnny and I always<br/>argue about the meaning of the word &apos;microtonal&apos;.  He keeps saying,<br/>&apos;All music is microtonal&apos;.  &apos;All music is microtonal&apos;, as if by<br/>repetition, he can make it true&quot; [sound familiar? - ed].  Tui has<br/>huge respect for Johnny and his work.  She claims credit for turning<br/>Johnny on to music other than 12-tone - true, Johnny?</p><p>She keeps a pair of pianos tuned a quartertone apart, arranged at the<br/>corner of a room at 90 degrees to each other, so that the performer<br/>can sit at the apex and play both.</p><p>Tui&apos;s toying with getting online, and we did our best to encourage her<br/>to do so.  She has local contacts who can help her with hardware and<br/>software problems.  I&apos;m almost certain she&apos;ll have a blast online; I&apos;ll<br/>try to get her on the tuning list when/if it happens.</p><p>Although we caught Tui in the middle of renovations, she made time to<br/>receive us graciously.</p><p>As I write, I am listening to &quot;Tui St. George Tucker&quot;, Centaur CRC 2354,<br/>many works I had never heard before, and I must say, I had never<br/>realized just how talented she is.  &quot;Notes from the Blue Mountains&quot;,<br/>though it is undeniably in 12-tET, is just lovely!  So is &quot;First<br/>Quartertone Lullaby&quot;.  Heck, the whole disk is great - I&apos;ve got to<br/>figure out where to buy copies to send to others.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>5/5/2001 11:45:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I just renewed my contact with Tui Saint George Tucker.</p><p>...and etc. Never one to be shy about confessing my own ignorance, I<br/>don&apos;t know anything about this person, but she sounds quite special.<br/>Where could I read more about her (some day), and maybe you could<br/>recommend recordings of works (beyond the one you mentioned...)?</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@adaptune.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2001 4:03:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[I wrote:]<br/>&gt;&gt;I just renewed my contact with Tui Saint George Tucker.</p><p>[Jon Szanto:]<br/>&gt;...and etc. Never one to be shy about confessing my own ignorance, I<br/>&gt;don&apos;t know anything about this person, but she sounds quite special.<br/>&gt;Where could I read more about her (some day), and maybe you could<br/>&gt;recommend recordings of works (beyond the one you mentioned...)?</p><p>Johnny and others on this list could give a much more complete bio on<br/>Tui than I could (Johnny?).  She&apos;s descended from a famous British<br/>soldier.  Became a recorder virtuoso, then started composing.  Did lots<br/>in quartertone.</p><p>I met her by chance in autumn 1992, via a mutual acquaintance.  My name<br/>struck a bell; she had met grandfather Max deLaubenfels in Pasadena in<br/>the late &apos;40&apos;s.  She encouraged me in my early experiments with tuning.</p><p>The only other disks I have with her work are:</p><p>   &quot;Soundbridge&quot;, Opus One CD 152 (2 tracks).</p><p>   &quot;Buxtehude, Moondog, &amp; Co.&quot; Spectrum SD-1001 (1 track).</p><p>Others, please fill in more info!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>5/6/2001 4:32:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Johnny and others on this list could give a much more complete bio<br/>&gt; on Tui than I could (Johnny?).</p><p>I&apos;ll look forward to any information, and (of course) appreciate the<br/>recordings you&apos;ve listed.
