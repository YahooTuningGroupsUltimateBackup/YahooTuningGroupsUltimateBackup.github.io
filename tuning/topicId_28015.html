Then one can create periodicity blocks and<br/>find interesting scales.</p><p>&gt; Is there any<br/>&gt; reason that a scale constructed of the ratios of a timbre that was<br/>&gt; stratospherically higher in the first place sounds &quot;better&quot; in that<br/>&gt; timbre.</p><p>What do you mean, stratospherically higher?

I think you may need to go back to Helmholtz . . .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Still, I can&apos;t quite understand the reasoning that a scale built of<br/>&gt; the intervals of a timbre, ET or otherwise, would necessarily sound<br/>&gt; best in the timbre from which it is constructed...</p><p>It sounds &quot;special&quot; (but not necessarily _most_ &quot;special&quot;) in such a<br/>timbre because you very frequently get _coinciding pairs of<br/>partials_. But the partials coincide even more strikingly if you use<br/>a scale which is an &quot;upside-down&quot; or &quot;utonal&quot; version of the timbre.<br/>Because then there will be a _common frequency_ such that _every<br/>note_ in the scale will have a partial at this frequency. I&apos;m not<br/>sure if Sethares emphasizes such an &quot;upside-down&quot; construction, but<br/>it would seem to be quite consistent with his philosophy.</p></div><h3><a id=28332 href="#28332">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/18/2001 2:14:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., genewardsmith@j... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Still, I can&apos;t quite understand the reasoning that a scale built<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; the intervals of a timbre, ET or otherwise, would necessarily<br/>sound<br/>&gt; &gt; best in the timbre from which it is constructed...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know what Sethares had in mind, but my reasoning in<br/>thinking<br/>&gt; that timbres built up from scales might be interesting had to do<br/>with<br/>&gt; critical bands; if we adjust overtones to follow the 12-et, for<br/>&gt; instance, the overtones can never be closer than a semitone.</p><p>This is in fact what&apos;s done in the Hammond organ . . . the &quot;partial&quot;<br/>stops produce 12-tET frequencies, rather than true harmonic overtones.</p><p>&gt; Since<br/>&gt; the critical band harshness peaks somewhere around a quarter-tone,<br/>&gt; that should have a definite effect when such tones are played<br/>&gt; together.
