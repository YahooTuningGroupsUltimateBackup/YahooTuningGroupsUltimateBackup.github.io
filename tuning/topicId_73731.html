He talks about adding up<br/>the &quot;Schweben&quot; of various fifths and if the sum is such and so the<br/>result is so and so. It all ONLY makes sense when the things you are<br/>adding up are the comma fractions. So Schweben meant &quot;degree of<br/>tempering&quot; - punkt schlu&szlig;!</p><p>Modern Germans think it means beating, but that is only because they<br/>have been confusing the issue for a century or so. So don&apos;t go ask a<br/>modern German what he thinks. Just read Neidhardt.</p><p>I don&apos;t like the suggestion &quot;suspended&quot; because it doesn&apos;t work very<br/>well with fifths larger than pure. Suspended things are hanging, which<br/>means down only.</p><p>Frankly, I don&apos;t see the problem with just a good literal translation<br/>- hovering. Why cast about for anything else? The helicopter can hover<br/>over the crime scene or under the bridge. What&apos;s the problem?</p><p>OK, back into hibernation to finish writing my book on my newly<br/>discovered ultimate method of tempering by ear. As I already told<br/>Thomas, it can be found be reading between the lines of Werckmeister<br/>and Neidhardt, and has the following characteristics:</p><p>(1) It does not use any absolute beat rates, and therefore works at<br/>any pitch level: French opera tone, Kammerton, Chorton, Hoch Chorton,<br/>even the &quot;exotic Venetian&quot; pitch.</p><p>(2) It does not require the tempering of any major or minor third,<br/>even to do things like 1/5 or 1/6 or 2/7 comma meantone.</p><p>(3) It does not rely on the comparison of beat speeds of any two<br/>intervals, neither fifths nor thirds (nor their inversions), adjacent<br/>or disjunct. None of that 3 beats of G-D for ever 2 beats of C-G and<br/>that sort of nasty complicated mucking about.</p><p>(4) The individual steps of the tempering process are not octave<br/>specific, that is, at any point within the tempering procedure, you<br/>can go up or down an octave if the beating is too slow or too fast to<br/>manipulate; the specific instruction for that step in the process and<br/>the exact procedure remains exactly the same no matter which octave<br/>you are in.</p><p>(5) It doesn&apos;t mater which pair of beating harmonics you are listening<br/>to when tempering a fifth; 3 against 2, 6 against 4, 9 against 6,<br/>whatever you can hear best can be used, and in all cases by following<br/>exactly the same instruction.</p><p>(6) Devising a recipe for any temperament is significantly easier than<br/>solving your average sudoku puzzle - even for the Neidhardts and<br/>Sorges, or Young&apos;s 3/16 S. comma, or Werckmeister&apos;s +/- 1/4 P. comma.<br/>No complicated math of any kind is required - no computer, no<br/>calculator, no slide rule, no abacus. Your average 8 year old could do<br/>it with pencil and paper in a couple minutes.</p><p>(7) It requires no technological assistance of any kind, not even a<br/>monochord, though the most ancient and simple time marking device is a<br/>handy method for honing your skills.</p><p>Anybody guess how it works? Write me off-list if so.</p><p>Happy Trails!</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>P</p></div><h3><a id=73733 href="#73733">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>10/4/2007 1:25:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Paul wrote: &quot;Just read Neidhardt.&quot;</p><p>Thanks for the drive by.

I demonstrated it last Thursday to a<br/>freshman music theory class at St Olaf College, and they could hear<br/>what I was talking about immediately on the harpsichord sitting<br/>there.  The 5ths/4ths are either noticeably tempered (i.e. double),<br/>scarcely tempered (i.e. single), or none.  No need to *count*<br/>anything, but only to have a musical skill.  It&apos;s an analog skill,<br/>not a digital one.  Counting beats down to the Nth is pretty much<br/>worthless anyway, since the harpsichord&apos;s intonation is going to move<br/>around a bit within the hour or two after it&apos;s tuned, or day to day<br/>or week to week.  Measuring any frequencies numerically is even more<br/>worthless (an exercise in futility), from this practical point of<br/>view.  Tune the whole instrument in 10-15 minutes by ear, be done,<br/>and spend the rest of the time playing music!</p><p>I too would like to get a copy of Neidhardt&apos;s whole document...but<br/>those several chapters at the pbwiki site are an excellent start.</p><p>Brad Lehman</p></div><h3><a id=73738 href="#73738">ðŸ”—</a>djwolf_frankfurt &#x3C;djwolf@snafu.de&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2007 3:25:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Paul Poletti&quot; &lt;paul@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just doing a drive-by posting after Thomas Dent alerted me to the<br/>fact<br/>&gt; that there was some discussion of my translation of Werckmeister and<br/>&gt; the problem of the word &quot;Schweben&quot;, postings which I have now read<br/>in<br/>&gt; the meantime.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All I can say is that if you read Neidhardt - the treatises Thomas<br/>has<br/>&gt; posted on the tuning wiki - there can be absolutely no doubt<br/>&gt; whatsoever that, at least for him, Schweben meant the amount of<br/>&gt; tempering an interval bears, NOT the beating.

Even the musical voice-leading usage is<br/>normally a suspension above (the retardation ^7-^8 excepted).</p><p>djw</p><p>Dr. Daniel Wolf<br/>Komponist<br/>Frankfurt, Germany</p></div>
