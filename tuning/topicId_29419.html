Have you decided what type of metal to use? The great thing about<br/>bars or tubes is that you can use them in instruments for a specific project, then hang them as<br/>chimes between instrumental uses. I&apos;ve never worked with bamboo but the ones I&apos;ve seen and heard<br/>are very beautiful. I&apos;d use bamboo tomorrow, but the UK is not the best place to find supplies.</p><p>I&apos;m always on the lookout for chimes and although I&apos;ve seen some great designs I think that there<br/>is much more to be done, not only in design, but also in tunings. At the back of my mind I have<br/>some ideas for wind and bird-powered chime machines for the garden.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div>
