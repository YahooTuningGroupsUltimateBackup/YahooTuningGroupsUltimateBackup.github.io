But the<br/>curves show more information, such as the locations of maximally<br/>discordant regions, and perhaps more importantly, the effects of<br/>nonzero tolerance. For example for ordinary harmonic sensitivity, in<br/>the upper octave, the third sruti for Ri (d&apos;) looks quite a bit more<br/>concordant against the Pa (G) drone note than most other srutis do --<br/>though it&apos;s outranked by its immediate neighbor, the fourth sruti for<br/>Ri. The ratios in this case are 80:27 and 3:1 -- 80:27 showing up as<br/>a lot more concordant than you would expect from the size of the<br/>numbers in the ratio, as Kraig has said of this ratio before.</p><p>Enjoy the graphs, and please let me know of any questions (I&apos;ll get<br/>to them eventually) . . .</p><p>Seasons Greetings,<br/>Paul</p></div>
