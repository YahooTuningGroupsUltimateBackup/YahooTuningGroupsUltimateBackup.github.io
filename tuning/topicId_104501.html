There are also temperaments with the fifth tempered by a fraction of a schisma. There are 614.21264 schismas in an octave. A similar useful unit is 1/612 part of an octave, or one step of 612-tone equal temperament, because this temperament has extremely accurate approximations of fifth and thirds, and because 612 is divisible by 12.

The final one of this cycle is<br/>&gt; cell # 612 = 2.

NOTE that the interval<br/>&gt; factor sequence along this extension starting from cell 613 is MM JJ MMMM &gt; JJ<br/>&gt; MM which coincides with the first twelve intervals of the progression. It<br/>&gt; means that the initial 12 cells of the second cycle is already coupled.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3) First cycle........

Most scales repeat every octave. Your progression of cells is a scale, right? Does it also repeat every octave?</p><p>  Is it that you can configure the progression to repeat in more than one way, depending on what you want? Is that what &quot;every chain of cells works statically&quot; means, that I can set up different chains differently depending on what I want?</p><p>  -Mike</p></div>
