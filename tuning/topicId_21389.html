The precise info is given<br/>in Gilmore&apos;s biography, which I don&apos;t have anymore.</p><p>I saw the building a little over a year ago, and it&apos;s abandoned<br/>and functioning mostly as a roost for hundreds of pigeons.<br/>It&apos;s made of wood, with a brick front.  There&apos;s a 2nd-floor<br/>balcony down most of the side of the building, and a big<br/>driveway next to it, over which the brick front extends,<br/>like an archway.</p><p>I had the thought that perhaps if a large group of us here<br/>signed a petition and sent it to the New Orleans city government,<br/>they may buy the building and make a museum out of it, or at<br/>least ive it some kind of use so that it&apos;s not abandoned and<br/>in danger of further deterioration or even fire, and put a<br/>historical placard on it.</p><p>Hmmm... perhaps we could do the same thing for the buildings<br/>in which Partch grew up in Benson (Arizona) and Albuquerque.<br/>Those two houses are in good condition and occupied, but there<br/>is no historical info about Partch located on the sites.</p><p>The house where he lived as a child in Phoenix either no longer<br/>exists or was moved across the street; a big apartment building<br/>now stands in its place.  There&apos;s no info here either.</p><p>But the building in New Orleans is in danger of disappearing,<br/>and may be of more historical interest than these others.</p><p>Now someone who&apos;s good at organizing this kind of thing<br/>should pick up this ball that I threw out...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=21393 href="#21393">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@ADNC.COM</h3><span>4/22/2001 2:52:48 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joe,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;MONZ@J...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Those in the microtonal community who adore and/or revere<br/>&gt; Partch&apos;s work might want to unite to take political action to<br/>&gt; preserve the deteriorating building where Partch lived in<br/>&gt; New Orleans, and where this act probably ocurred.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t recall the exact address, but it&apos;s on Camp Street<br/>&gt; a few blocks south of Canal.  The precise info is given<br/>&gt; in Gilmore&apos;s biography, which I don&apos;t have anymore.</p><p>Yes, well, you might want to check a little more carefully. One of<br/>the people that has written me from the Corporeal Meadows website is<br/>a musician who lives in New Orleans, I sent him the address, and took<br/>some photos which he later sent to me.</p><p>I don&apos;t believe the building is deteriorating, at least from the look<br/>of it. I have to find the letter, if this subject is of interest to<br/>you, because I don&apos;t remember all the details. There is still a sign<br/>about apartments on the building, though I don&apos;t know that is what<br/>its current use is. But the building, as of about 6 months ago, is<br/>still up and OK.</p><p>&gt; I saw the building a little over a year ago, and it&apos;s abandoned<br/>&gt; and functioning mostly as a roost for hundreds of pigeons.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s made of wood, with a brick front.  There&apos;s a 2nd-floor<br/>&gt; balcony down most of the side of the building, and a big<br/>&gt; driveway next to it, over which the brick front extends,<br/>&gt; like an archway.</p><p>Are we sure we are talking about the same building? Since we are near<br/>each other in physical proximity (a rarity on the list, or any list),<br/>let&apos;s find a time later in the week to meet -- I&apos;ll find the letter<br/>and photos.</p><p>&gt; Hmmm... perhaps we could do the same thing for the buildings<br/>&gt; in which Partch grew up in Benson (Arizona) and Albuquerque.</p><p>Philip Blackburn and Bob Gilmore have tracked down most of the<br/>residences that Partch lived in over the years.</p><p>&gt; Those two houses are in good condition and occupied, but there<br/>&gt; is no historical info about Partch located on the sites.</p><p>Who, in the general public, would even know him? (I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s<br/>not a nice idea, but I thought *I* was a fetishist! :) )</p><p>&gt; The house where he lived as a child in Phoenix either no longer<br/>&gt; exists or was moved across the street; a big apartment building<br/>&gt; now stands in its place.  There&apos;s no info here either.</p><p>Gee, Joe, the house he rented in Encinitas is still standing, albeit<br/>having been remodeled. You could start in your own (current) home<br/>town! Not to mention Harry&apos;s last residence...</p><p>&gt; But the building in New Orleans is in danger of disappearing,<br/>&gt; and may be of more historical interest than these others.</p><p>Check and re-check your facts and sources.</p><p>&gt; Now someone who&apos;s good at organizing this kind of thing<br/>&gt; should pick up this ball that I threw out...</p><p>We&apos;re having a hard time gathering more than a handful of FAQ<br/>entries, Joe! You want us to raise money and embark on a preservation<br/>project of national scope? The California sunshine (in evidence<br/>today) is really making an optimist out of you!!!</p><p>OK: coffee before the end of the week, and I&apos;ve got a CD for you as<br/>well...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
