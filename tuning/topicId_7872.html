The webpage now says so.</p><p>Regarding the second tuning: Interesting... scanning thru<br/>my own book when I was making this webpage, I saw right away<br/>that the *shape* of the lattice of the Marpurg tuning matched<br/>your periodicity block, without noticing the transposition,<br/>and actually typed the citation to it into the webpage,<br/>*then* realized that it was transposed, so I deleted the<br/>citation to Marpurg and wrote that bit about &apos;I have been<br/>unable to find&apos;, etc.  I&apos;ve decided to also add the info<br/>about Marpurg to the webpage.<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock2.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock2.htm</a></p><p>I&apos;d be glad to add the postings about Ramos as an appendix<br/>to this page.
