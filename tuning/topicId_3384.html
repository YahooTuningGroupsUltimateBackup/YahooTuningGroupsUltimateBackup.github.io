I say this because if they *had* used it consistently,<br/>&gt;the result would have been to what Martin Vogel refers as &quot;comma shifts&quot;<br/>&gt;in any music except that which is the most simple-simon harmonically.<br/>&gt;Comma shifts are a real problem of using JI in an a cappella context,<br/>&gt;because they usually result in a lowering of overall pitch placement.</p><p>This is the dispute that I am at present having with Paul.<br/>It is interesting that you raise it in regard to singers, because it is<br/>possible to actually check out what frequencies they sing and to<br/>determine a possible method of resolving this issue with regard to AJI<br/>electronic instruments.</p><p>&gt;Take, for example, a simple chord succession (I know, this is a tonal<br/>&gt;example, but I think the same sort of thing would occur in a modal<br/>&gt;context) like I - IV - ii - V - I, rendered in 5-limit JI.  If we<br/>&gt;measure the tonic pitch as 1, this means the submediant pitch in the IV<br/>&gt;and ii chords must measure 5/3; fine so far, but then in order for the<br/>&gt;supertonic to form a just fourth with the submediant in the ii chord, it<br/>&gt;has to measure 10/9, rather than the 9/8 that this pitch is &quot;supposed&quot;<br/>&gt;to be.  The tonic and dominant of the final I chord end up being too low<br/>&gt;by the syntonic comma as well, measuring 80/81 and 40/27 respectively.<br/>&gt;Sing through these chords just 4 or 5 times in a row in literal just<br/>&gt;intonation, and you&apos;ll discover that the final I chord is a full<br/>&gt;half-step lower than the beginning one.</p><p>I don&apos;t dispute that this would happen if the most obvious transition<br/>was done at each point.  However I think that the obvious approach<br/>ignores the fact that the human memory and the feel of the piece has a<br/>wider span than just the previous chord.  For that reason I believe that<br/>a break will happen in the above sequence and the original &quot;I&quot; above<br/>will be returned to.  The exact location of the break is uncertain to me<br/>but I believe that it can best be understood through considering the<br/>concept of centre of gravity of tuning.  I have explained this<br/>alternatively as a dancer in a spotlight where the dancer moves about a<br/>lot but the spotlight follows more slowly.  The spotlight is the centre<br/>of gravity of the piece&apos;s tuning and the dancer the present chord.  At<br/>some point the dancer will do a larger leap back into the spotlight<br/>rather than a smaller one out of the spotlight.  Taken locally this is<br/>incomprehensible but globally it is quite meaningful.</p><p>I believe that major confusion is caused by our naming convention where<br/>we call D and D- (or D and D+) by the same name &quot;D&quot;.  We would never<br/>think of playing a Db for a D or vice versa because we call these<br/>separate names and so we should also accept that D and D- are not the<br/>same note and that they can occur near each other in the same piece.<br/>This is well understood in Indian music (in practice if not in theory).</p><p>Let me repeat.  There is no reason why D and D- cannot occur near each<br/>other in a piece of music.</p><p>As an example take Bach&apos;s well tempered clavichord piece.  Of course it<br/>might be considered rather low life to play a piece that was designed to<br/>show off tempering in JI however I believe that this is possible.  In<br/>that case each arpegio is played twice and the first time has a strong<br/>musical relationship to the second arpegio of the previous pair.<br/>However the second plaing of the same &quot;notes&quot; (same note names anyway)<br/>has a different meaning and is to be matched with the following<br/>arpeggio.  A friend described this as musical puns.  I would love to<br/>have someone do this as I describe in JI and have the responses of<br/>people who listened to it in that manner.</p><p>&gt;I would like to suggest, Mr. Monzo, that singers have historically<br/>&gt;(consciously or unconsciously) taken 5-limit JI as an intonational<br/>&gt;ideal, but in practice have tempered some intervals (especially melodic,<br/>&gt;rather than harmonic, ones) slightly in order to prevent comma shifts<br/>&gt;from causing pitch to drop lower...and lower...and lower...</p><p>Tempering is not necessary for the above reasons.  However it may be<br/>that singers actually do temper because their minds are polluted by<br/>pianos tuned to 12 tet as you said before.</p><p>&gt;Of course, there is the possibility that early singers didn&apos;t care if<br/>&gt;their pitch was dropping, in which case just intonation could have been<br/>&gt;used more consistently.</p><p>Aaaahhhhhhh!!!!</p><p>&gt;In any case, it&apos;s doubtful that it has ever<br/>&gt;been used that accurately, seeing as perfect intonation is unattainable<br/>&gt;in an imperfect universe.  :P</p><p>Perfect intonation is attainable in this perfect universe   8^D</p><p>&gt;Oh, one more note.....personally, I don&apos;t see the value of performing<br/>&gt;plainchant in just intonation.  The big advantage of JI is how pretty it<br/>&gt;makes _simultaneously held_ pitches sound.  I mean, I can see how it<br/>&gt;might be used in early polyphony, such as organum, where you have<br/>&gt;long-held simultaneities, but performing monophony in JI, even in a<br/>&gt;highly-reverberant cathedral,  seems like a fairly pointless endeavour<br/>&gt;to me, except perhaps as some sort of carnival stunt.  And then, of<br/>&gt;course, there&apos;s still that potential comma shift problem...</p><p>Several people have mentioned that in a reverberant space there are<br/>harmonies between the present note of the melody and previous notes<br/>which are still reverberating.  Clearly even very simple music has a<br/>greater complexity when played under such circumstances when compared to<br/>modern music which is generally not performed in reverberant spaces.</p><p>A local modern cathedral (Auckland&apos;s Parnell) has a ceilling that has<br/>a discontinuity in the slope so that any notes with about a 2.5 metre<br/>wavelength will totally cancel themselves as they are reflected.<br/>No doubt designed by some trendy architect who had no idea about<br/>acoustics.  The results were so dreadful that they installed a great big<br/>floating baffle (I can&apos;t think of a better description) above the<br/>orchestral or singer area so that this effect was reduced.  Not only has<br/>the art of making true harmony in music been almost lost in the last few<br/>centuries, so has the art of making cathedrals for making music in.</p><p>-- Ray Tomes -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/rtomes/rt-home.htm</a> --<br/>   Cycles email list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/cyc.htm</a><br/>Alexandria eGroup list -- <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/alex.htm</a><br/>Boundaries of Science <a href="http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm">http://www.kcbbs.gen.nz/users/af/scienceb.htm</a></p></div>
