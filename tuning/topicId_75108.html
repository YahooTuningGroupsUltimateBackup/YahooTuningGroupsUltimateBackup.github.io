In fact, no reason why one has to always tune the most obvious beats to be beatless. If one wanted to for some reason one could tune one of the weaker beating frequencies to be beatless.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if one could tune a pure 45/32 that way - seems rather high in the harnonic series. But some people can hear separate individual frequencies in a sound more easily than others, e.g. bell tuners have to develop this ability acutely if they tune bells by ear - and by extension it seems at least theoretically, there may be some with truly exceptional abilities to discern the pitches who can hear the beats for the 45th harmonic if present, because it is at a different frequency from any other beating partials.</p><p>It&apos;s a bit tangential to the main discussion but perhaps it may help clear up something or other?</p><p>Robert</p></div>
