More on this kind of thinking in a moment. But if<br/>I ever were to want to hear it, it would be on a dreadfullyoutoftune<br/>bar-room piano, with Tom Waits singing/intoning.</p><p>&gt;Also, IMO, the world would be a lesser place without<br/>&gt;_While My Heart Keeps Beating Time_ in it.  There have<br/>&gt;been many days when that song rambles around in my mind<br/>&gt;for hours.</p><p>Sort of like hearing a 50hz tone where none exists?  :)</p><p>Next up, Brian Caaaaarrrrlllllssssoooonnn (I love baseball):</p><p>&gt;If you don&apos;t want someone else to play music you have composed, you should<br/>&gt;not have composed it in the first place.</p><p>Sorry, that&apos;s just a bit too weird to believe -- composing music and<br/>performing it are two completely separate issues.</p><p>&gt;If you don&apos;t want to listen to it, don&apos;t listen to it.</p><p>It might not be the composer not wanting to listen to it, but rather<br/>knowing that others somewhere else might be hearing a totally distorted<br/>&apos;version&apos; of his creative work.</p><p>&gt;Who has the authority to say what was and was not the intention of<br/>&gt;the composer?</p><p>What about the composer? If Partch had wanted to increase the performance<br/>possibilities during his lifetime he *himself* could have certainly<br/>arranged pieces for string quartet; however, it is Ben Johnston&apos;s chosen<br/>vessel of performance, not Partch&apos;s -- he did *not* like string quartets.<br/>He wrote *one*, early in life, and burned it a short time later (along with<br/>other works). The only other time he came close was about 12 measures for<br/>string trio in &quot;Water! Water!&quot;, used in the most sarcastic and bitter way<br/>to parody an elected public official.</p><p>Besides, with the smallest amount of research one can find out that<br/>Partch&apos;s works were much more than &apos;pieces of music&apos; -- they were corporeal<br/>works to be done in a manner as far from the European concert hall as<br/>possible.</p><p>Talk about the writing on the wall...</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s ultimately speculation, even if you have strong evidence for your<br/>position.</p><p>True, we wouldn&apos;t want to be swayed by volumes of writing by the composer<br/>himself. How in the world could *he* have known what was best for his<br/>creative output? Brian, I don&apos;t mean to be sarcastic or glib, but there<br/>haven&apos;t been many artists that have written on these very aspects of<br/>performance as Partch did. It&apos;s all there for anyone to check out, in<br/>&quot;Genesis of a Music&quot;, in his writings documented in various publications,<br/>etc. Definitive? Hell no...he&apos;s *dead*. Fairly clear how the chips should<br/>fall? IMHO, yup.</p><p>&gt;Wasn&apos;t it Rachmaninoff who said Horowitz played his music better than he<br/>&gt;could himself?  I&apos;d like to hear Beethoven played with wax paper on a comb</p><p>These three people have nothing to do with the topic at hand...</p><p>Dear Eduardo:</p><p>Thanks for Didier&apos;s address...</p><p>And, finally, Maestro Rosati:</p><p>&gt;Since there exist recordings of Barstow under Partch&apos;s direction, I do not<br/>&gt;see why some feel threatened by others who may feel moved to &quot;experiment&quot; or<br/>&gt;&quot;play&quot; with the music to see what they can come up with.</p><p>Threatened is a bit strong, but it is true that with the dilution of the<br/>original vision you have a high possibility of the original intent being<br/>lost. If it were just some university groups mucking around I doubt notice<br/>would be taken. What *has* caused&#xFFFD;concern (well, at least for me) is that<br/>it is Kronos, juggernaut of &quot;new and improved&quot; music -- is there a composer<br/>they *won&apos;t* play? (It sort of reminds me of &quot;American Gladiators&quot; of new<br/>music).</p><p>KQ are so adept at glitzy marketing, especially in this 25th year of their<br/>playing, that it would be possible for the real deal to get swept under the<br/>carpet, which would be a great loss of a unique voice of this century. For<br/>people who have worked so hard to champion some composers, it is hard to<br/>see why they couldn&apos;t steer clear this time -- unless you know their real<br/>reason: in their words, they simply couldn&apos;t imagine *not* being involved<br/>in the music of Harry Partch.</p><p>In spite of the fact that he certainly imagined it *without* them.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t think its necessary to gird yourself and go on a crusade over things<br/>&gt;like this.</p><p>Yes, you and many close family and friends.</p><p>&gt;It smacks of that same ole&apos; &quot;One True Faith&quot; mentality that<br/>&gt;usually moves me to opine &quot;get a life, buddy&quot;.</p><p>I have an unusually active life, thanks; this is just one aspect of it. I<br/>always planned on a twist of Thoreau -- I plan on leading a life of &quot;noisy<br/>desperation&quot;!</p><p>Lastly, to any who might want to hear some damn original Partch, someone<br/>sent me the following tonight, currently on auction at eBay:</p><p>Title of item: Harry Partch &quot;World of Harry Partch&quot; CBS lp<br/>Seller:        <a href="mailto:baronelmo@hotmail.com">baronelmo@hotmail.com</a><br/>Starts:        05/15/99, 20:45:09 PDT<br/>Ends:          05/22/99, 20:45:09 PDT<br/>Price:&#x9;Starts at $15.00<br/>To bid on the item, go to:&#x9;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=104826721">http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=104826721</a>&gt;</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Enough; I&apos;ve got rehearsal tomorrow, with lot&apos;s of 12tet notes to face.<br/>Pray for me...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon<br/>..... . . . . . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . .....<br/>Jonathan M.
