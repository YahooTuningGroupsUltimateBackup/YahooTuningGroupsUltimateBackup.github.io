<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>the meaning & use of "microtonal"</h1><h3>Drew Skyfyre &#x3C;skyfyre2@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>12/27/1999 2:39:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Monzo, about this &quot;microtonal&quot; business, you mentioned something about<br/>peeking in the archives for a clear definition. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s<br/>necessary, since the meaning most associated with it is found in most<br/>dictionaries. It does have it&apos;s basis in 12EDO.</p><p>The term &quot;microtonal&quot; is not an accurate word for what we do &amp; the approach<br/>to music we practice &amp; advocate.</p><p>Some here have stated that they consider all music as microtonal. It&apos;s not.</p><p>*Unless* you are someone who has mostly listened to 12EDO all his life AND<br/>music in other tunings is new to you (12EDO being your reference) AND that<br/>particular music is in a tuning consisting of intervals smaller than a 12EDO<br/>semitone. Then, to you in particular, that music would be microtonal.</p><p>Oxford dictionary :<br/>microtone : an interval smaller than a semitone.</p><p>Britannica says :<br/>&quot;Music using tones that are not an exact number of semitones (half steps)<br/>apart.&quot;</p><p>This interpretation is flawed, since the word *is* &quot;micro&quot;-tone, implying an<br/>interval smaller than some reference interval, namely a 12EDO semitone.</p><p>This is after all a term coined in the western, 12EDO world. And, I think,<br/>promoted by droids of the &quot;classical&quot; music world.</p><p>Like I mentioned before, I advocate &quot;xenharmonics&quot;. Though Darreg conceived<br/>of it as a term for any (?) non-12EDO tunings, it&apos;s easily adapted. Most<br/>importantly, unlike &quot;microtonal&quot;, it does not imply any physical quantity.<br/>Almost (more ?) a state of mind.</p><p>You could think of a free pitch instrument like a violin as a xenharmonic<br/>instrument, not just a microtonal one.</p><p>------<br/>&gt; By the way, the term &quot;Xenharmonics&quot; has misleading connotations (Zen,<br/>&gt; harmonic), while &quot;microtonal&quot; conveys a very clear idea to your audience<br/>&gt; that you&apos;re not just being harmonically Zen, but rather in some tuning<br/>&gt; system other than 12-TET even if your piece is MACROtonal. The term<br/>&gt; Xenharmonic is pretty fresh, but who wants to explain their terms to<br/>&gt; everyone? Microtonal music is inaccessible enough even to accomplished<br/>&gt; composers - so why alter the established nomenclature?<br/>&gt; I&apos;m more interested in getting rid of olden terms like CADENCE than terms<br/>&gt; which have SOME meaning like &quot;microtonal.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>Eric, as you can see &quot;microtonal&quot; does NOT cover all tunings.<br/>It has one very specific meaning, refering to one specific class of tunings.</p><p>As far as the possible confusion between &quot;xen&quot; and &quot;zen&quot;, I don&apos;t see this<br/>as a problem. Personally I have never enountered this confusion when I<br/>talk about it to anyone. I think most people know the difference<br/>between &quot;zen&quot; &amp; &quot;xen&quot;, and don&apos;t easily confuse the two. There&apos;s only one<br/>&quot;zen&quot; word, &quot;zen&quot;. There are a lot of words out there built on the Greek<br/>&quot;xenos&quot;. In fact, you could say the establishment&apos;s resistance of<br/>xenharmonics is to a degree, xenophobia.</p><p>Ciao,<br/>Drew</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free <a href="https://twitter.com/yahoo">@yahoo</a>.com address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>Afmmjr@xxx.xxx</h3><span>12/27/1999 10:16:49 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Drew, I see you working with logic in trying to pin down the right name for<br/>the right subject.  Personally, I don&apos;t feel comfortable with the Xen for<br/>strange (as in Xenharmnic).</p><p>The work microtonal has worked well for decades now and no amount of logic<br/>will change this fact.  That people now have different understandings of the<br/>term &quot;microtonal&quot; is an interesting development, considering how little it<br/>was heard when most of the &quot;authority&quot; books were being written.</p><p>Though Daniel Wolf is sticking to the literalist approach, eliminating the<br/>neutral third as a microtonal interval.  Perhaps it is too linear a<br/>definition.  When I can play a different fingering for a pitch that is not<br/>conventional then it is as microtonally distant from a conventional pitch as<br/>anything smaller than a semitone is from the tonic.</p><p>Clearly, no one on this list can tell anyone else what the the definition is<br/>for each and every term, just as there is not a single notation for all to<br/>use.  Live free and prosper.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
