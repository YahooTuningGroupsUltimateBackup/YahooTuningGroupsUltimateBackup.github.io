Every message that I have posted here in the<br/>past has basically led to nothing, if at all, a couple responses.<br/>Most of what I have learned, I have found by myself instead of<br/>through anyone else, since I have not yet seen anyone who has any<br/>real ideas.  I have begun my own yahoo group, but as of now, I am the<br/>only member because I have not seen anyone else who seems interested<br/>in a serious endeavor like my own.  For now, I would like to question<br/>many of the terms and vague descriptions which I have seen here.  I<br/>believe that most of these things do not even have much relevance to<br/>tuning at all.  I also believe that most of it has only been copied<br/>from other books that have been published a long time ago.  I have<br/>seen no new innovative ideas here at all.  I have only heard a great<br/>deal of talk.  It is obvious that everyone here has very few<br/>resources if any.  The most that can be done is talk, but talking<br/>about things which lead in no direction is pointless.<br/>   There are many inaccurate terms which I see here and which have<br/>been used, such as 7-limit or lattices or anything.  These terms have<br/>little meaning and only point fingers instead of explaining anything<br/>at all.  I have found that prime numbers do have a great deal to do<br/>with ratios and frequencies, but they have little to do with how we<br/>perceive frequencies.  For instance, we cannot tell whether a certain<br/>frequency is composed of a prime 5, 3, 7 or anything.  Also, each<br/>prime only approximates to a certain identity that is NEVER<br/>PINPOINTED ACCURATELY BY ANY NUMBER.  I believe the relevancy of a<br/>prime ratio is determined more by its context than by its identity.<br/>For instance, I have found that Zarlino&apos;s chromatic using Prime 5<br/>ratios intermingled with Prime 3 ratios is a vast mistake.  The<br/>reason being is that these ratios contrast with each other and<br/>contribute to make the scale system less unified.  On the contrast,<br/>the &quot;Pythagorean&quot; system uses all Prime 3 and is a much smoother and<br/>more consonant system than the latter.  I believe the reason behind<br/>this is that PRIME NUMBERS BELONG WITH EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF WITH<br/>OTHER PRIME NUMBERS.  If we had to choose between having a system<br/>with primes 1, 2, and 3 or having a system with primes 1, 2, 3, and<br/>5, I believe it would be wiser to choose the first option.  The first<br/>option also is a much more capable system since it is able to<br/>modulation in many more keys than the second choice can.  Zarlino&apos;s<br/>chromatic cannot modulate at all.  Pythagorean tuning can modulate to<br/>many keys with a minimum of error except for the 7th mode, which has<br/>the slightly bad fifth.  These minor tuning inaccuracies are nothing<br/>compared to 12 ET which is completely out of tune and cannot be<br/>compared to the Pythagorean system.  The Pythagorean system is, in my<br/>mind, the best choice with the falsities of our dominant keyboard<br/>design.  THE ONLY WAY FOR PERFECT SYSTEMS IS TO HAVE AN ALTERNATE<br/>DESIGN.  I have seen other designs, but I think that all of them are<br/>poor, inaccurate, and insufficient.  Many of them are too<br/>complicated, have too many keys, and are impractical.  I have a<br/>design which is not much different than the traditional one, and it<br/>is supremely more flexible.  The problem is that I know of no one who<br/>can build it.  I have no resources except the concept and design.  It<br/>is obvious that the tuning community has little resources, and<br/>everytime I have come here for assistance, I have received little or<br/>nothing.  If you do not realize the importance of this you are<br/>blind.  If you think that talk is all you need you are blind.  To<br/>make any difference, you need action.  We cannot allow for the same<br/>thing to happen to music that has been happening for centuries and<br/>centuries prior.  Most people in the past only talked, and then they<br/>died.  Their ideas died with them, and little or nothing was done<br/>after that.  An instrument must be built with a workable design, not<br/>one which ends up becoming a relic of the past or a novelty in a<br/>museum.  If you wish to talk about ideas relating to tuning, designs,<br/>and things which matter that is fine, but it very disappointing to<br/>see nothing beneficial coming out of this at all.  It is a disgrace<br/>to the art of tonality.</p><p>Wizard</p></div><h3><a id=28256 href="#28256">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@juno.com</h3><span>9/17/2001 2:19:26 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;PageWizard, Magician of the Caverns&quot;</p><p>&gt;    There are many inaccurate terms which I see here and which have<br/>&gt; been used, such as 7-limit or lattices or anything.</p><p>A lattice is a discrete subgroup of R^n as a topological group.<br/>Sometimes we add the condition that the quotient be a compact<br/>topological group.

I appreciate your frustration, but I<br/>do think you&apos;ve leveled some charges that are undeserved.  Each one<br/>of us on this list is passionate about music, I believe, but for each<br/>of us that passion takes a focus different from many others on the list.<br/>I think that we&apos;ve all experienced the feeling that others don&apos;t<br/>appreciate the things _we_ think are important as much as we ourselves<br/>do.  I know I&apos;ve felt that way many times!  Most especially, on those<br/>occasions when I&apos;ve posted some music I think is lovely, and have gotten<br/>no response whatever.  That hurts!  But it&apos;s important to realize that<br/>it&apos;s not because other people are apathetic, but because their energies<br/>are focused elsewhere, at least at that moment.</p><p>You have some ideas for a new, for general keyboard.  That&apos;s great!<br/>There are, as you may be aware, several keyboards out there, either in<br/>planning and/or available for purchase.  I must admit that I have not<br/>taken an intimate interest in new keyboards, simply because I don&apos;t<br/>think they would be of use to me as an individual (my keyboard skills<br/>are poor, and I make music in other ways).</p><p>You are broke, and would like to interest people with funds to invest.<br/>I wish you luck, for sure.  Most of us on this list seem to be broke,<br/>in that we&apos;re getting by but often aren&apos;t able to purchase equipment<br/>that we&apos;d like to, stuff that&apos;s already available at a reasonable price.</p><p>&gt;There are many inaccurate terms which I see here and which have<br/>&gt;been used, such as 7-limit or lattices or anything.  These terms have<br/>&gt;little meaning and only point fingers instead of explaining anything<br/>&gt;at all.</p><p>If you listen to my 7-limit vs. 5-limit tunings of any piece, I don&apos;t<br/>think you&apos;d say there is &quot;little meaning&quot; to the distinction!  These are<br/>concepts with very real application, not abstractions.</p><p>&gt;I have found that prime numbers do have a great deal to do<br/>&gt;with ratios and frequencies, but they have little to do with how we<br/>&gt;perceive frequencies.  For instance, we cannot tell whether a certain<br/>&gt;frequency is composed of a prime 5, 3, 7 or anything.</p><p>This statement confuses me, because once we become attuned to them,<br/>particular ratios and particular chords become vividly unmistakable.<br/>There is _nothing_ that sounds like a 4:5:6:7 chord, for example, except<br/>the real thing.</p><p>&gt;If you wish to talk about ideas relating to tuning, designs,<br/>&gt;and things which matter that is fine, but it very disappointing to<br/>&gt;see nothing beneficial coming out of this at all.  It is a disgrace<br/>&gt;to the art of tonality.</p><p>Sorry you feel that way.  I do not agree that there is &quot;nothing<br/>beneficial&quot; going on on this list, but that&apos;s just _my_ egocentric<br/>perspective.</p><p>I would urge you to do what you can, using your own resources as<br/>available, to make your dreams come into reality.  Perhaps you will end<br/>up laughing at all of us who did not invest!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=28262 href="#28262">ðŸ”—</a>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>9/17/2001 5:47:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Wizard (?)</p><p>Sorry to be distracted by a terrorist attack.
