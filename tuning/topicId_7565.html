An antherm of Kirnberger&apos;s opens<br/>&gt;Bosanquet&apos;s book on temperament.  &quot;Greater certainly would be the gain of<br/>&gt;song if we really had the enharmonic intervals in our system.  For then<br/>&gt;singers would accustom themselves, throm their youth up, to sing correcty the<br/>&gt;smallest enharmonic intervals, and the ear of the listener to appreciate<br/>&gt;them; and thereby would it be possible, in many cases, to make the expression<br/>&gt;of the passions very much stronger.&quot;  Kirnberger&apos;s work is published by Yale<br/>&gt;University Press and I hope to report on it further.</p><p>Thanks, Johnny. I think Kirnberger and I have been listening to the same<br/>sort of tuning. The question remains: what tuning? I made a similar remark<br/>in my &quot;Lies&quot; book about sensitive tuning sending music in a kaleidoscope of<br/>exciting directions (or something like that--I&apos;m on the road and don&apos;t have<br/>a copy handy). I&apos;m in the awkward position of knowing what I&apos;m hearing but<br/>not having the numbers to describe it. However, I learn something every time<br/>I log on to the tuning list. Thanks for your contributions.</p><p>Jerry</p></div>
