So for some (but not all)<br/>musical purposes, the line at the center encodes all the needed<br/>information.  Neither Tenney nor I invented this line, which is just<br/>log-frequency space.<br/>Typically, a (continuous) n-dimensional tuning lattice can be<br/>written as the product of a single line that represents log-<br/>frequency space and an (n-1) dimensional space whose meaning is a<br/>hard to interpret in the above sense.  My sense is that this<br/>redundancy often arises only when you try to make the tuning<br/>lattices continuous -- for instance in a discrete 2 x 3 tuning grid,<br/>every vertex corresponds to a distinct pitch, because the generators<br/>are relatively prime.</p><p>2) As Daniel Wolf observes, any chord of pitches can be represented<br/>as a set of points on the central Y axis of Tenney&apos;s graph, and that<br/>voice leading distances can be represented by how far the points<br/>have to move to get from one configuration to another.  This is just<br/>to say that we can represent chords of pitches as unordered<br/>collections of points in log-frequency space, and that voice leading<br/>distance is represented by the distance between one configuration<br/>and another.<br/>The problem is that this representation doesn&apos;t perspicuously<br/>capture the natural music-theoretical idea that chords containing<br/>the pitch classes are similar objects: for instance {C4, E4, G4} and<br/>{C4, G4, E5} are represented by distinct configurations of points on<br/>the central axis, whereas -- for many (but not all) music-<br/>theoretical purposes -- it is useful to think of them as instances<br/>of the same object, the C major chord.</p><p>3) To this end, it is useful to represent chords as sets of<br/>unordered points on a circle, so that the C major chord is {C, E,<br/>G}, or {12, 4, 7} on the circumference of an ordinary clock face.<br/>The problem with this representation is that it doesn&apos;t clearly<br/>depict the relation between a chord&apos;s internal structure and it&apos;s<br/>voice leading possibilities.<br/>(Again, one could &quot;Tenney-ify&quot; the circle by adding additional<br/>dimensions, and then one could use these dimensions to draw tuning<br/>lattices of various sorts.  From the standpoint of voice leading we<br/>don&apos;t need to do this, but for thinking about tuning it might well<br/>be useful.)</p><p>4) Given 3), it&apos;s useful to look at the configuration space of<br/>unordered points on a circle -- i.e. the geometrical spaces in which<br/>each point represents a *configuration* of points on the circle.<br/>These are the orbifolds I discuss in my paper.  In these<br/>configuration spaces a point represents a chord, and a line segment<br/>represents a voice leading between two chords.<br/>Happily, when you understand these orbifolds, the connection between<br/>a chord&apos;s internal structure and its voice leading capabilities<br/>becomes perfectly clear.  The musical properties of &quot;evenness&quot;<br/>and &quot;unevenness&quot; simply correspond to the distance from the center<br/>of the orbifold; transpositional symmetry is represented by one set<br/>of discrete symmetries of the orbifold; and inversional symmetry is<br/>represented by another set of reflectional symmetries of the<br/>orbifold.</p><p>I don&apos;t want to make any grand claims for my work.  In some sense,<br/>it&apos;s quite surprising that these spaces weren&apos;t discovered 100 years<br/>ago.  But I do think that this is relatively new territory, and<br/>rather different from the discrete lattices familiar from tuning<br/>theory.</p><p>DT<br/>--<br/>WARNING: Princeton Email is currently very unreliable.
