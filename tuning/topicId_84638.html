You&apos;ve done a good job<br/>cleaning up the audio Chris. In fact, the quality of the tape adds to<br/>the microtonality of the improvisation. There is almost a bell-like<br/>quality in the tone of the prepared guitar.</p><p>Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Sep 15, 2009, at 6:58 AM, vaisvil wrote:</p><p>&gt; This is a continued response to Carl asking about trying to make<br/>&gt; music with a random set of intervals.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As with all things guitar 12 TET is mixed in with your tuning of the<br/>&gt; guitar - and its hybrid really.

I always thought this can only be done with something like frequency shifters or ring modulators. I think this raises a similar point as the fact that you can get a similar effect like speeding up a recording of your voice just by breathing helium (in fact, not quite the same because helium doesn&apos;t change the pitch, only the timbre).</p><p>Secondly, you&apos;ve reminded me of a recording which I made back in 2001. But there I WAS really using a hardware ring modulator (which is currently not working any longer) combined with some almost infinitely repeating echoes. Maybe you&apos;ll like it.
