Dave and I<br/>now have a new and improved sagittal symbol pair for the 7-comma --<br/>with *curved* flags on the *right* side (as before), for which the<br/>down-arrow even happens to resemble Daniel Wolf&apos;s 7-comma-down symbol<br/>(differing only in that the sagittal flag is curved). If Dave were<br/>to provide you with a font containing:<br/>For 1deg: new + and - symbols that fulfill the Bosanquet/Wilson<br/>requirements,<br/>For 2deg: the new (improved) sagittal 7-comma pair, and<br/>For 3deg: the sagittal 11-diesis up and down arrows that you already<br/>have,<br/>would you be willing to give it a try?</p><p>This symbol set has 2 out of 3 symbol pairs that are *strictly<br/>correct* for both HEWM and sagittal, and confusability is minimized<br/>both *within* HEWM and *between* HEWM and sagittal.</p><p>Comments?</p><p>***I think something wonderful and surprising has just arrived in the<br/>mail...</p><p>More subsequently!</p><p>JP</p></div>
