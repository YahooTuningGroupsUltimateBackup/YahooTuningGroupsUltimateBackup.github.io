Audio includes sound from a replica of these instruments. The ivory flute in particular is pretty advanced for something made by, well, cavemen.</p><p>What wasn&apos;t mentioned was how these flutes might have been tuned, or whether they were made by humans like us living today, or the Neanderthals, who became extinct only ten thousand years later. Also, as a commenter stated, fragments of bone flutes of similar age have previously been found, such as those found in Slovenia in 1997 and reported in National Geographic.</p><p>~D.</p></div><h3><a id=83939 href="#83939">ðŸ”—</a>Andreas Sparschuh &#x3C;a_sparschuh@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/25/2009 10:45:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Danny Wier&quot; &lt;dawiertx@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What wasn&apos;t mentioned was how these flutes might have been tuned, or<br/>&gt; whether they were made by humans like us living today, or the<br/>&gt; Neanderthals, who became extinct only ten thousand years later....</p><p>Here some links,<br/>that might address yours quest:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divje_Babe_flute#Neanderthal_flute">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divje_Babe_flute#Neanderthal_flute</a><br/>&quot;Whether it is actually a flute created by Neanderthals<br/>is a subject of debate...&quot;<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_music#Flutes">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_music#Flutes</a><br/>&quot;....is a matter of ongoing debate.<br/>The earliest unambiguously musical bone pipe is from Geissenkl&ouml;sterle in Germany, dates to about 36,000 BP and is associated with modern humans.&quot;<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohle_Fels_flute#Hohle_Fels_flute">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohle_Fels_flute#Hohle_Fels_flute</a><br/>&quot;The Hohle Fels flute is the oldest musical instrument ever discovered.
