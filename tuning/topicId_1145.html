I&apos;ve also played<br/>some chords and music on pianos in mean tone temperament which has<br/>two kinds of minor third, 9 approximating 6/5 and 3 approximating 7/6.<br/>I found that in cases where it was impossible to have everything just,<br/>experimenting and listening to results was very helpful and I arrived at<br/>the solution you mentioned for having some notes glide in cases of<br/>modulation as when notes forming 7/4 in one chord form 16/9 in the<br/>next, etc. I found that in cases of four stacked fourths, making the<br/>fourths just and letting the minor third between the ends of the stack be<br/>32/27 - a Pythagorean minor third sounded fine, even when there was<br/>some &quot;bite&quot; of beating between the notes of the 32/27.  Fifths or fourths<br/>off by much more than 5 cents begin to get conspicuous quickly in the<br/>kind of music I&apos;ve worked with - at least they sound conspicuous to me<br/>and to a lot of people.  I believe the diminished 7th chords really get a<br/>distinctive &quot;just&quot; sound if they are seen as 4:5:6:7 chords with the root<br/>note 4 altered - raised a semitone - say by 17/16.  This happens on the<br/>piano - the diminished 7th chords can sound really neat.  It might be<br/>interesting to experiment with the augmented triad.  A 7:9:11<br/>frequency ratio chord could really sound good there in certain contexts,<br/>and I suppose would sound out of place compared with an EQT<br/>augmented triad in other places.</p><p>You&apos;re doing exciting stuff and this is only the beginning.</p><p>Dave Hill,     La Mesa, CA</p></div>
