It<br/> represents common western musical notation from the 17th<br/> century onwards, including both classical and popular music.<br/> The language is designed to be extensible to future coverage<br/> of early music and less standard 20th and 21st century<br/> scores. Non-western musical notations would use a separate<br/> XML language. As an interchange language, it is designed to<br/> be sufficient, not optimal, for diverse musical applications.<br/> MusicXML is not intended to supersede other languages that<br/> are optimized for specific musical applications, but to<br/> support sharing of musical data between applications.<br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a></p></div>
