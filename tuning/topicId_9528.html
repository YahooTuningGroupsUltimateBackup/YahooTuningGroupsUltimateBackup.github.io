The bandwidth is real narrow for a media server, so it<br/>&gt; cannot handle many simultaneous listeners, but the software is supposed to<br/>&gt; cut the bitrate as the number of listeners increases.</p><p>John, this is a great idea but few of us are connecting to the web at a<br/>high enough rate to use<br/>it.  Most of us, at a pretty safe guess, are connecting with 56k modems<br/>or less, meaning that<br/>we can&apos;t reliably use a stream much faster than the mid 20s to mid 30s.<br/>24k would probably be<br/>optimal, in terms of reaching a majority of us with the highest feasible<br/>quality.  To reach<br/>almost everyone, you&apos;d need to knock it down to around 16k.  Mpu still<br/>sounds pretty good at<br/>those rates, considering it&apos;s most often heard from $20 computer<br/>speakers.  A lower bandwidth<br/>broadcast should also help you serve more streams at once, should they<br/>be needed.</p><p>I&apos;m especially interested in the tape swap material, since I lost my<br/>copy in a car accident the<br/>first time I tried to listen to it.  I guess it put me in a trance or<br/>something :-/</p><p>--<br/>David J.
