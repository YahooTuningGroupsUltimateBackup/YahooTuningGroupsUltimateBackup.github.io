Also looks like it was named after a misspelling of my<br/>&gt; name. By the way, when I looked in the Scala archive, I didn&apos;t see<br/>&gt; two22.kbm, and I don&apos;t think I saw this one either. Where did you<br/>&gt; download yours from?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Sorry, Paul... that was just a typo on my part.  The names of the Scala<br/>mapping file is:</p><p>erl22.kbm</p><p>And the two files for mapping 22 pitches from the decatonic scales are:</p><p>two22.kbm</p><p>and</p><p>two22a.kbm</p><p>&quot;two22.kbm&quot; is in Scala 1.6.  Do you have that latest version, or 1.5?<br/>Additionally, &quot;Two22b.kbm&quot; was sent to me privately by Manuel op de<br/>Coul. I don&apos;t believe it is in Scala yet.</p><p>I will send you these three files by private e-mail.</p><p>Thanks!<br/>______________ ______ ____ ___<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
