There&apos;s also a famous<br/>version of &quot;How High The Moon&quot; by Ella Fitzgerald, live in Berlin, that<br/>was killer.<br/>   As far as intonation in jazz, when the instruments in question are<br/>piano or guitar, it&apos;s pretty obvious that 12 eq is the basis for the<br/>pitches. As in blues, of course, the horns are bending all over the<br/>place, so lot&apos;s of things can be happening. Miles Davis, in particular,<br/>always sounded like he was moving around between the 12 eq system. I saw<br/>Duke Ellington in college, and Johnny Hodges did &quot;Passion Flower,&quot; and<br/>bent the shit out of the notes...it was pretty amazing.
