The sets<br/>of sixxen that have been recorded reflect the fact that the scale and range<br/>are very different but all possess the chorus quality.  In the case of the<br/>UC set, we chose the pitches of the &apos;master&apos; sixxen through trial and error<br/>and taste and then built the others to fit within the 1/4 -tone requirement.<br/>I have not gone through and made a map of what pitches we actually have - as<br/>related to an equal-temperment scale, but it is decidedly not typically<br/>tonal.  What is truly amazing about the way Xenakis wrote the material for<br/>this movement is that it transcends the instrument, you could play it on any<br/>appropriately tuned instruments and it would sound like Metaux.&quot;</p><p>HTH,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a></p></div>
