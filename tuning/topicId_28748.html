My<br/>full arrangement has some simple harmonisation and a few canon entries<br/>and drones which I&apos;ve written in to help them cope with parts, so the<br/>tuning of that doesn&apos;t really concern us here. What I&apos;m interested in<br/>here is bars 5 and 6 and bars 15 and 16.</p><p>In the first of these, 5 &amp; 6, I can hear all sorts of possibilities for<br/>tuning this descending melody. Bear in mind that the choir is &apos;a<br/>cappella&apos; and that many are beginners and they don&apos;t know anything other<br/>than unaccompanied singing because I won&apos;t use piano during<br/>rehearsals.(I was going to say they don&apos;t know anything better, but<br/>accompaniment isn&apos;t really better). I&apos;m concentrating on intonation,<br/>blend and &apos;purity&apos; (whatever that is), and I&apos;d be interested in any<br/>comments or suggestions as to how you might tune this descending segment<br/>for choir and how you might teach it. The harmony is a simple iim9, V9,<br/>I landing on Bflat major (seventh). I suspect most of the crunchy stuff<br/>lies around the V9 bar, ie bar 6.</p><p>Bars 15 and 16 interest me for the bluesiness of the c sharp (the<br/>harmony is II9, V7sharp 5 in the key of Bflat), but I think something<br/>could be done with the lead in to that c sharp.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m interested in any leads as I&apos;m sneaking microtonality in by<br/>the back door with the choir. They do whatever I tell them so I&apos;m going<br/>to have some fun.</p><p>Best Wishes to All.</p></div>
