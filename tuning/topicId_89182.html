BUT (and this is the big but) I already know I&apos;m not buying any Korg PA sort of thing because there doesn&apos;t seem to be a detailed descritpion of the SysEx format of their microtuning messages, which makes it impossible for me to easily embed microtunings into my pieces or make some utilities that could possibly convert text to MIDI retuning data. For now, I&apos;m still going on with my Yamaha QS-300 because the XG microtuning format is explained in the publicly available XG specs. But I have used this instrument for over 10 years and sooner or later, I&apos;ll have to switch anyway. So I&apos;m just thinking ... Any suggestions?</p><p>Thanx.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
