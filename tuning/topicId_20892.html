It has most of the capabilities you are asking for, microtonal tuning in cents or by ratio or a mixture, additive harmonic synthesis, something like a drawbar organ, with a waveform display and FM synthesis, effects unit, oscilloscope and more.</p><p>Peter Frazer,<br/><a href="http://www.midicode.com">www.midicode.com</a></p></div><h3>M.

Both are Java-based, so you will need<br/>to have Java development tools. Silence is wrapped around CSound, which<br/>will do what you want but has a steep learning curve.
