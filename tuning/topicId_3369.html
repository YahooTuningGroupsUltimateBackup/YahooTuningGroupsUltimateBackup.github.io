That gives a highly raised<br/>&gt; leading tone much in accord with the modern practice of a typical<br/>&gt; string quartet playing Beethoven.</p><p> Fascinating - I&apos;ve never encountered Kahrimanis or seen his work.<br/> (how about a reference?)</p><p> The chord you describe (where 1/9 is the &apos;dominant&apos; of the scale,<br/> which makes 27/16 the utonal &apos;1-identity&apos; of the chord) can also<br/> be expressed as:</p><p>   1/9 :    1/7     : 1/6 :    1/5<br/> = 3^1 : 3^3 * 7^-1 : 3^2 : 3^3 * 5^-1<br/> = 3/2 :   27/14    : 9/8 :   27/20</p><p> The interval between 27/14 (= 1/7) and the &apos;tonic&apos; 1/1, the<br/> &apos;highly raised leading tone much in accord with the modern<br/> practice of a typical string quartet playing Beethoven&apos;, has<br/> a size of ~1137.04 cents.</p><p> Without actually checking it, this does indeed seem to agree with<br/> my perceptions of recordings of Beethoven string quartets.</p><p> So apparently a tuning experiment involving Beethoven&apos;s music<br/> is amenable to the inclusion of 7-limit ratios, which I excluded.<br/> Perhaps I&apos;ll expand my experiment to include them.</p><p> [Dale C. Carr, TD 206.6]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Excerpting:]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;From: <a href="mailto:monz@juno.com">monz@juno.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;[...]  The (culturally-conditioned?) preference for a sharpened<br/>&gt;&gt; Pythagorean &apos;leading-tone&apos; makes this chord sound flat, at<br/>&gt;&gt; least in this piece, and to my ears.  It sounds a lot better<br/>&gt;&gt; using the Pythagorean pitch for the leading tone, and choosing<br/>&gt;&gt; the &apos;root&apos; and &apos;5th&apos; which make a nice 4:5:6 triad with it,<br/>&gt;&gt; in the corresponding area of the harmonic lattice.[....]&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder whether the term &quot;sharpened Pythagorean &apos;leading-tone&apos;&quot;<br/>&gt; here isn&apos;t perhaps pleonastic and potentially confusing too?</p><p> OK, perhaps a few additional punctuation marks would have made<br/> my statement more precise.  How about:</p><p> &quot;The (culturally-conditioned?) preference for a sharpened<br/>  (Pythagorean?) &apos;leading-tone&apos; makes this chord sound flat&quot;</p><p> [Carr]<br/>&gt; Can one actually speak of a Pythagorean leading tone?</p><p> Musicians, or tuning theorists anyway, routinely use the term<br/> &apos;Pythagorean leading tone&apos; to mean an interval with the ratio<br/> 243:128 [= 2^-7 * 3^5 = ~1109.78 cents].</p><p> [Carr]<br/>&gt; The description of a flat sounding chord also has me wondering.<br/>&gt; monz might mean that the *third of the chord* is lower than he<br/>&gt; expected, but not likely that there&apos;s a flat sign in front of it.</p><p> I did indeed mean the former and not the latter.<br/> (wasn&apos;t that clear in context?)</p><p> [Carr]<br/>&gt; But a *chord* might sound flat [= dull?] for some other reason<br/>&gt; than the tuning, &lt;...snip&gt;</p><p> This may or may not be true.</p><p> In fact, I&apos;ve found that there&apos;s an intimate relationship between<br/> tuning and timbral perception, and I mean this in a way that&apos;s<br/> different from Bill Sethares&apos;s ideas.</p><p> In my analysis of Louis Armstrong&apos;s singing and playing, in<br/> particular, I found that tiny microtonal differences in pitch<br/> sounded like timbral differences; or perhaps it&apos;s the other way<br/> around - it&apos;s impossible to tell by ear which is the cause and<br/> which the effect.</p><p> [Carr]<br/>&gt; &lt;...&gt; so maybe he&apos;s not referring to the third at all.</p><p> But yes, I was referring to the fact that the &apos;3rd&apos;, which in<br/> the &apos;Dominant [V]&apos; chord is the &apos;leading-tone&apos; of the scale,<br/> sounded too flat when tuned to 15/8, and to my ears, made the<br/> entire chord sound too flat in the context of the overall<br/> harmonic progression of the piece.</p><p> [Carr]<br/>&gt; As a relative novice to tuning matters, may I plead for more<br/>&gt; precise expression?  The subject is too complex to tolerate<br/>&gt; unclear use of terms like sharp and flat.</p><p> Exactly why I started my online Tuning Dictionary.<br/> (altho &apos;sharp&apos; and &apos;flat&apos; are not yet included)</p><p> Sorry that you found my use of terminology unclear.</p><p> What&apos;s unfortunate in this case is that &apos;sharp&apos; and &apos;flat&apos;<br/> have more than one meaning: either specifically a semitone<br/> (whatever that is! - that word also has multiple meanings,<br/> depending on the tuning) higher or lower in pitch, as in<br/> referring to the accidentals denoted by those names; or an<br/> amount higher or lower which is either unspecified or is<br/> not a semitone.</p><p> I used &apos;sharp&apos; and &apos;flat&apos; in the latter sense: lower and higher<br/> in pitch than the &apos;target&apos; by an unspecified amount, respectively.</p><p> The amount of discrepancy was indicated precisely by my use of<br/> the terms &apos;Pythagorean&apos; or &apos;5-limit&apos;.  I considered including<br/> the actual ratios in my post, but they&apos;re all on the webpage<br/> already, along with a lattice diagram.</p><p> Did you look at the webpage yet?<br/> Or listen to the experiment itself?</p><p> Perhaps I should have been more pedantic and descriptive,<br/> for the benefit of those subscribers without web access.</p><p> Hope this clarified things for you.</p><p> (and *please*, call me monz - I *detest* excessive formality)</p><p> Joseph L.

He and I corresponded on e-mail<br/>quite extensively. He sent me a huge paper which embodied years<br/>of work, both theoretical and experimental, but which I can&apos;t<br/>seem to locate right now. His theory is that chord progressions<br/>in the music of the great common-practice composers strictly<br/>follows the following rule: the root (in the Partchian sense)<br/>always moves by a consonant interval (syntonic comma errors are<br/>allowed here). He tested this theory by creating different<br/>synthsized versions of &quot;great&quot; musical passages, which differed<br/>microtonally in the details of the tuning, so that some versions<br/>conformed to his theory while others did not. He claimed to find<br/>statistically significant evidence that subjects preferred the<br/>versions that conformed to his theory.</p></div>
