See below.&quot;</p><p>&gt; The original recording made by Partch used a bass drum instead (and<br/>&gt; the Bass Marimba was added much later).</p><p>&quot;I bring it up because a couple of people have written me in the intervening<br/>days, having seen the Barb performance, and found it ludicrous.&quot;</p><p>There was much that was ludicrous at the Barb performance, but it was not the<br/>tubed marimba, your hearsay to the contrary.  To my ear, it was beautifully<br/>amplified<br/>(3 mikes) and had a rich tone.  Please provide me with whatever detail you<br/>have, directly if it sensitive.</p><p>&gt; A tubed-diamond marimba could not work<br/>&gt; (so don&apos;t fear all holders of original Partch instruments).<br/>&gt; However, Skip LaPLante spent over a year constructing a<br/>&gt; wonderful &quot;traveling&quot; Kithara. It takes 2 full days to build and a<br/>&gt; single day to dissemble. The materials cost $1000 and it was built<br/>&gt; to Partch&apos;s specifications.</p><p>&quot;Long ago I wrote you, Johnny, after careful listening to your<br/>performance of &quot;U. S. Highball&quot;, including commentary on the usage of<br/>the Kithara. In a number of places I was sure that it was an octave<br/>off, and that was among a number of other problems. You never replied<br/>back, so you don&apos;t want to own up to any problems that might crop up.&quot;</p><p>Jon, Jon, Jon, this has nothing to do with nothing.  We haven&apos;t performed<br/>&quot;U.S. Highball&quot; since the recording I sent.  I DID reply back to you, but<br/>you&apos;ve<br/>forgotten.  I discussed your e-mail with each performer.  And of course, I do<br/>not<br/>agree with every one of your criticisms.  (I was really surprised that you<br/>thought my<br/>voice was too &quot;gay.&quot;)</p><p>Re Skip LaPlante&apos;s promo for Music for Homemade Instruments:</p><p>&quot;Jon: Some attitude. Look, someone could make a great instrument, to<br/>specs, completely unaware of it&apos;s eventual use. But these statements<br/>seem to reinforce the impressions that a number of people have<br/>gathered from this performance.&quot;</p><p>And to keep the ball rolling, may I suggest that you are misrepresenting Skip<br/>LaPlante regarding the Kithara.  For his own group (Music For Homemade<br/>Instruments), Skip is a pioneering musician in a historical role worthy of<br/>comparison to Partch, himself.  His personal aesthetic is one thing (e.g., he<br/>always wears 2 different color socks).  But when he played as one of 13<br/>percussionists in Lincoln Center for the Ives &quot;Universe&quot; premiere, he wore a<br/>tuxedo.  When he built the Kithara, he gave it a Partch look, indeed.  It is<br/>far and away, an intentionally refined instrument.</p><p>&quot;When I hear, at concerts I haven&apos;t been able<br/>to attend, that performers are taking a liberties in aesthetics and<br/>performance standards that go beyond the pale, I won&apos;t look the other<br/>way.&quot;</p><p>If you are stating flatly that I am personally taking liberties in aesthetics<br/>and performance standards going beyond some pale, please be specific.  As you<br/>should know by now, the AFMM Ensemble is devoted to ever progressing<br/>performances of Partch&apos;s music, not unlike Newband before they were given<br/>control of the originals.  In fact, other than guitarists John Schneider and<br/>Didier Aschour (who each have specially made Partch-design guitars), the AFMM<br/>Ensemble is the only group capable of presenting a number Partch works.  As<br/>the instruments live out their mortality, it will only be ensembles made up<br/>of musicians THAT DID NOT PLAY WITH PARTCH who will continue Partch&apos;s music -<br/>with their own instruments -- into the 22nd Century and beyond.   I think it<br/>is wrong for you to disparage the pioneers in some ways no differently than<br/>Partch&apos;s own critics.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=21058 href="#21058">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>4/14/2001 5:57:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20986.html#20986">/tuning/topicId_20986.html#20986</a></p><p>&gt; I had written on 12-tET:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; It is especially worthwhile for me to hear of<br/>&gt; &gt; Partch as successful using it since there is disparagement,<br/>&gt; &gt; even among original Partch ensemblers, that Harry&apos;s music<br/>&gt; &gt; is not strong enough compositionally without the later<br/>&gt; &gt; exotic percussion.
