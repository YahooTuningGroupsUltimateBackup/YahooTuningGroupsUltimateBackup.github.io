To make the example audio files sound like a normal voice, I had to slow them down to about 3/4 of the original speed (see the section &quot;What Helium does to speech&quot;): <a href="http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/phys_about/PHYSICS!/SPEECH_HELIUM/speech.html">www.phys.unsw.edu.au/phys_about/PHYSICS!/SPEECH_HELIUM/speech.html</a></p><p>There was the event in the 1960s when a man who spent 30 days in the ocean in the depth of 200 feet was in a &quot;decompression chamber&quot; where he was breathing Heliox instead of Oxygen. Trying to make the recording of his speech sound like a normal voice, I realized I had to shift the pitch down at least by a sixth (IOW, 3/5 of the original speed): <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/lnfsound/stories/991015.stories.html">www.npr.org/programs/lnfsound/stories/991015.stories.html</a></p><p>Some websites say there&apos;s something called &quot;Helium Speech Descrambler&quot; which should make the Helium voice sound like normal. But I wonder how this can be done. The Helium only changes the pitches of the resonances in your mouth, not of the voice itself, and therefore if I apply a time compressing pitch-shifter to the sound, although the voice can then sound like normal, its pitch falls significantly.</p><p>BTW: Some people used SF6 to get the opposite effect. But interestingly, when I wanted to make such a recording sound like a normal voice, I had to raise the pitch at least by a fifth or a sixth -- a fourth was not enough. More here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KLNYlYGdYs">www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KLNYlYGdYs</a></p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m still wondering how these people do it that they don&apos;t faint, considering that these gasses are not suitable for breathing.</p><p>Okay, that&apos;s just about it. So ... Back to scales again. :-D</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/1/2008 5:00:48 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Petr Pa&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;&dcaron;&zdot;&dblac;zek wrote:</p><p>&gt; Some websites say there&apos;s something called &quot;Helium Speech Descrambler&quot; which &gt; should make the Helium voice sound like normal.

Kyma comes with examples -- maybe it&apos;s LPC resynthesis.  These pages at least show that it&apos;s possible:</p><p><a href="http://forum.cakewalk.com/tm.asp?m=899239&mpage=1&key=">http://forum.cakewalk.com/tm.asp?m=899239&mpage=1&key=</a></p><p><a href="http://www.flstudio.com/help/html/plugins/Edison_stretch.htm">http://www.flstudio.com/help/html/plugins/Edison_stretch.htm</a></p><p>              Graham</p></div>
