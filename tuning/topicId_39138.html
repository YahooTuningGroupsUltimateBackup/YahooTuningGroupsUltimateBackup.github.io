(See my previous papers in the Bulletin: &quot;Bode&apos;s Law<br/>Explained,&quot; Cycles 30: 82, 1979, and &quot;On the Special Theory of<br/>Order,&quot; Cycles 36: 219, 1985.)  Therefore, if the clock pattern is<br/>applied to our solar-planetary system--both systems involve objects<br/>in 360-degree motion around their respective centers--any two planets<br/>will cross only a certain number of times.  Thereafter, the pattern<br/>repeats.  (see my paper: &quot;Why the sunspot cycle 22 years long?&quot;<br/>Cycles 46: 3, 1996.</p><p>As I pointed out in my previously cited papers, the primary cause of<br/>the full-wave 22-year sunspot cycle is the Saturn-Uranus synodic<br/>cycle.  These two planets cross &quot;only 22 times&quot; before the pattern<br/>repeats.</p><p>Whereas a clock has only two hands, the solar-planetary system is not<br/>made up of a mere two planets; the cumulative effect of each set of<br/>two planets must be computed as they relate to the others.  In<br/>addition, the solar-planetary electrical and magnetic field in which<br/>the multitude of planets move and cross, is, itself, in motion with<br/>respect to the center of the galaxy.  Also, the planets are<br/>precessing with respect to the distant star field.  Consequently,<br/>our solar-planetary system will not behave as mathematically precise<br/>as a clock.  Indeed, each individual 22-year cycle varies immensely,<br/>from about 20.8 to about 27 years.</p><p>In The Old Farmer&apos;s Almanac 1981, science writer Guy Murchie<br/>popularized my theory by reference to my publications, asking: &quot;Is<br/>there order among the planets?  Or, as Pythagoras once put it, is<br/>there Music in the Spheres?&quot;</p><p>I published Arnold&apos;s Law in 1979, as follows:</p><p>Bodies_Proportion___Degreed Arcs___Fraction___Ideal Mean**<br/>       Or Perimeter</p><p>Sun__________0___________0________0____________0<br/>Mercury______1___________3_____1/120______3.14 X10(7th)miles<br/>Venus________2___________6______1/60______6.28<br/>Earth________3___________9______1/40______9.42<br/>Mars_________4__________12______1/30_____12.56<br/>Ceres*_______8__________24______1/15_____25.13<br/>Jupiter_____15__________45______1/8______47.12<br/>Saturn______30__________90______1/4______94.24<br/>Uranus______60_________180______1/2_____188.49<br/>Neptune_____90_________270______3/4_____282.74<br/>Pluto______120_________360______4/4_____376.99</p><p>*Ceres: prime representative of so-called &quot;asteroids&quot;</p><p>**means: adjusted for diameters of both bodies, sun and planet</p><p>The sun is at 0, where it belongs in a sun-centered system.  And all<br/>the other bodies are suspended in space at naturally represented<br/>numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120.  Because<br/>astronomy measures the solar-planetary system by using the third<br/>planet from the sun, Earth, as its unit, the so-called astronomical<br/>unit has kept astronomy in the dark as to the ideal proportions of<br/>our solar-planetary system.  The sun must be set to O in the<br/>mathematical sequence, inasmuch as the laws of math require it:<br/>&quot;The number 0 is not a successor: every natural number other than 0<br/>has exactly one immediate predecessor; this means that the sequence<br/>of natural numbers has a beginning in its first member 0&quot;<br/>[Encyclopedia of Mathematics, Gallert, Kustner, Hellwich, Kastner,<br/>et al, 20].</p><p>The unit distance is equated with the distance from the sun to the<br/>first natural body, Mercury.  The solar unitary distance (s.u.)<br/>equals 1.  In order to be true and certain to the heliocentric<br/>solar-planetary system model as is the stated purpose of the<br/>physicist (and not necessarily the astronomer), the heliocentric unit<br/>must be programmed into the model.  Thus, su(x) = 1.</p><p>In conclusion, I urge interested readers to review the detailed<br/>heliocentric data and patterns published in my earlier papers.<br/>Perhaps someone can generate a full-scale computer analysis to<br/>confirm why the sunspot cycle averages 22 years.</p><p>Bill Arnold</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>New DSL Internet Access from SBC &amp; Yahoo!<br/><a href="http://sbc.yahoo.com">http://sbc.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=39143 href="#39143">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Arnold &#x3C;billarnoldfla@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2002 12:54:04 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gary Vezzoli writes, &quot;Dear Bill -- I am happy to read your posting<br/>and to think about the Uranus-    postulate.  However, in physics we<br/>are learning that there are no general laws, only statistical<br/>relationships, and none of these are true universally (everywhere in<br/>the universe) and this, I believe, with unambiguous certitude.  I<br/>think that particle physicists and astrophysicists would now agree.<br/>What is the journal &quot;Cycles&quot; and where do I locate it, since I am<br/>unfamiliar with such. Best wishes, Gary C. Vezzoli.<br/>Dr.Gary Christopher Vezzoli, Physicist&quot;</p><p>Well, when I mentioned the general laws of physics, I meant as<br/>applied to our solar-planetary system, and would include the galaxy,<br/>but then none of us have been out there in deep space to say with an<br/>absolute certainty that the general laws of physics apply or not,<br/>universally.  As to the Foundation for the Study of Cycles, I found<br/>the following at Ray Tomes&apos; website:</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The Foundation for the Study of Cycles</p><p>     <a href="http://homepages.kcbbs.gen.nz/rtomes/rt-cycle.htm">http://homepages.kcbbs.gen.nz/rtomes/rt-cycle.htm</a></p><p>A New Science<br/>These two facts cry aloud for the creation of a new science - the<br/>science of cycles - which is concerned with rhythmic fluctuation per<br/>se, which will develop techniques of cycle analysis, which will<br/>isolate cycles in all the 30 or 40 different branches of science<br/>where cycles are important, and which, having assembled enough facts,<br/>will perhaps someday venture to advance some theories in regard to<br/>cause and effect.</p><p>The Foundation for the Study of Cycles was created, in 1940, to found<br/>such a new science, and to develop it to the point where it could<br/>serve mankind. In the eleven years which have elapsed since its<br/>creation, the Foundation has made slow but steady progress.</p><p>It should be clear from the above remarks that the Foundation is<br/>purely an educational and scientific body and in no sense a<br/>commercial organization. It exists, not to make money but to serve<br/>mankind.</p><p>An eminent group of scientists and administrators have lent their<br/>names to the Committee of the Foundation. Various scientific<br/>societies have appointed advisors to help with its awards, and many<br/>individual scientists have joined the Foundation as scientific<br/>members. On its part, the Foundation has tried to maintain the high<br/>scientific standards of the many universities and institutions here<br/>and abroad which are, through their professors, connected with it,<br/>and I think we have pretty well succeeded.</p><p>Cycles Can Help You, Too<br/>The research of the Foundation is of immediate practical value to the<br/>average citizen, too. By uncovering cycles in production and trade it<br/>throws light on the probabilities of booms and depressions. By<br/>uncovering cycles in international conflict it throws light on the<br/>probabilities of war. By uncovering cycles in the prices of<br/>commodities and of securities it throws light on the probabilities of<br/>panics and of other financial disturbances.<br/>The results of the Foundation&apos;s research are made available to the<br/>general public by means of reports, bound together and issued 12<br/>times a year in - the form of a magazine called Cycles - A Monthly<br/>Report.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>The Foundation for the Study of Cycles Inc. is an international,<br/>non-profit, research and educational institute, incorporated in 1941<br/>by Edward R Dewey, and is the world center for multidisciplinary<br/>cycle research.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Board of Directors<br/>Chairman: Martin A Armstrong, Chief Economist, Princeton Economic<br/>Institute<br/>Vice Chairman: Peter Borish, Computer Trading Corporation<br/>President: Walter J Bressert, Editor, Cycle Watch<br/>Secretary: John T Burns PhD, Professor, Bethany College<br/>Treasurer: E S Dewey, President, Management Advisors Inc<br/>Directors: William Doane, Anthony F Herbst PhD, Robert R Pretcher Jr,<br/>Arne Sollberger MD<br/>Executive Director: Richard Mogey<br/>Staff<br/>Executive and Research Director: Richard Mogey<br/>Editor: Dianne Epperson<br/>Cycle Projections: Stephen Bush</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Foundation for the Study of Cycles Inc.<br/>900 West Valley Road, Suite 502<br/>Wayne, Pennysylvania 19087-1821, USA<br/>Tel: (610) 995-2120<br/>Fax: (610) 995-2130<br/>WWW pages<br/>Email<br/><a href="mailto:cycles@netaxs.com">cycles@netaxs.com</a></p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Next<br/>Email: Ray Tomes, Editor<br/>&quot;Ray Tomes [Cyc]&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz">rtomes@kcbbs.gen.nz</a>&gt;</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Bill Arnold</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>New DSL Internet Access from SBC &amp; Yahoo!<br/><a href="http://sbc.yahoo.com">http://sbc.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=39144 href="#39144">ðŸ”—</a>Bill Arnold &#x3C;billarnoldfla@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2002 1:07:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Martin Sewell writes, &quot;Alignments of planets sometimes yield pretty<br/>pictures for sky gazers, but are otherwise totally unimportant, as<br/>the tidal force exerted on the sun is so tiny as to be insignificant<br/>...In summary, the alignment of planets could not and does not affect<br/>sunspot activity or the weather.&quot;</p><p>Of course, your response to the theory is predicated upon the premise<br/>that either &quot;tidal force&quot; or &quot;alignment of the planets&quot; is the cause<br/>of the observed phenomenon.

If you can stretch<br/>the Sun Spot cycle to about 22.68 years, which would be half of the<br/>Sat - Uranus synodical period of 45.3631years, you would closing<br/>approximate Wheeler&apos;s 510 year cycle via squaring 22.68 = 514.48<br/>years.   By the way, adding 514.48 years to summer of 1492 = 2007 =<br/>should project a major turning point for Western civilization<br/>According to Wheeler&apos;s theory,  this should be the beginning<br/>of the end for the dominance of the West and the beginning of<br/>dominance for the East.  Buy Chinese Food, Sell Texas BBQ.<br/>Thanks, Norman&quot;</p><p>Actually, Wheeler&apos;s very detailed charts going back and covering<br/>recorded history were used extensively by Edward Dewey in his various<br/>books, and Cycles researchers are appreciative of Raymond Wheeler&apos;s<br/>contributions to cycle theory: &quot;Climate - The Key to Understanding<br/>Business Cycles.&quot;  But, as joking as you are in your final thought, I<br/>am sure you know that Wheeler&apos;s point in comparative cycle analysis<br/>was that cycles come, and cycles go, and we can better predict the<br/>future with a comparative record of events to peruse.  Obviously,<br/>Gray&apos;s hurricane predictions owe much to the groundwork laid by early<br/>researchers such as Dewey and Wheeler.  Raymond Wheeler&apos;s charts on<br/>history and business cycles, cycles of wars, coupled with sunspot<br/>cycles, and Ned Dewey&apos;s books, were what most fascinated and inspired<br/>me.</p><p>Bill Arnold</p><p>Bill Arnold<br/><a href="mailto:billarnoldfla@yahoo.com">billarnoldfla@yahoo.com</a><br/>Independent Scholar<br/>Independent Scholar, Modern Language Association<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>  &quot;There is magic in the web&quot; Shakespeare (Othello, Act 3, Scene 4)<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>__________________________________________________<br/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>New DSL Internet Access from SBC &amp; Yahoo!<br/><a href="http://sbc.yahoo.com">http://sbc.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=39149 href="#39149">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/30/2002 2:49:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>List,</p><p>I&apos;ve written Mr. Arnold asking him to check his email settings and to not mistakenly send non-tuning posts to the tuning list.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=39198 href="#39198">ðŸ”—</a>Mark Rankin &#x3C;markrankin95511@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2002 2:40:26 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Jon Szanto,</p><p>I disagree.
