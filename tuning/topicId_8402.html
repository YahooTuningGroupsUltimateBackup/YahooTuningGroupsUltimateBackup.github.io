Numbers are necessary for me when I perform microtonal works.<br/>Sometimes people notice that I will put a -1 cent above a note, even when<br/>this is clearly not critical on a bassoon, or most any other acoustic<br/>instrument.  Even vibrato is greater than 1 cent!</p><p>The reasons I insists on putting the -1 cent (or +1 cent) is critical to an<br/>accurate performance.  Firstly, the bassoon does not tune up.  It is put in<br/>tune before musical usage.  Like a violinist, it is the mind that has to be<br/>&quot;in tune&quot; with the tuning expectations.   This means, like a trumpet, I have<br/>up to a minor third of play with the pitch for most any fingering.  By<br/>indicating a whole number of cents distinction, including the single cent, my<br/>mind is properly prepared to play the desired frequency.  A professional<br/>bassoonist has a physical memory for where the sounds are and though I might<br/>not adjust for the single cent, I would be careful not to distort the note in<br/>any other way.</p><p>It has been many years now in doing this.  At first I would place a large N<br/>for normal note.  Mixing the letter with the numbers trips up my reading<br/>expectations in musical real time.</p><p>Cents and ratios are different ways of using numbers, one additive and the<br/>other relational.  Both have been found useful for understanding the<br/>sensibility of microtonal intervals, however once the understanding is<br/>achieved, cents is preferable for my real time music making.</p><p>Johnny Reinhard<br/>AFMM</p></div>
