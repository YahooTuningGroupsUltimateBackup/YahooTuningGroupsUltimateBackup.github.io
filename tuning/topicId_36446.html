I use scotch tape to change the shape of<br/>the tone holes to different temperaments and also use different fingerings<br/>for other tunings (like quartertones).  In 2 weeks I am playing Bach&apos;s #4th<br/>Brandenburg Concert in the historic tuning of Werckmeister III or chromatic.<br/>Every hole has some tape except the thumb hole and the hole of the first<br/>finger of the right hand which allows for tuning &quot;C&quot; with the other<br/>instruments, and which is not taped.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>ertugrulInanc &#x3C;ertugrulinanc@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/18/2002 10:28:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;emotionaljourney22&quot; &lt;paul@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; you may want to talk to johnny reinhard here on this list (or on<br/>the<br/>&gt; columbia version of this list), he has extensive experience<br/>modifying<br/>&gt; the recorder with scotch tape to play all kinds of tuning systems<br/>&gt; (and he&apos;s no stranger to alternate fingerings either).</p><p>I hope Johnny will follow up. Until that, let me gaggle a bit.</p><p>I discovered most of the fingering myself (on a standard descant<br/>recorder) and managed to sound all necessary intervals in Turkish<br/>music. Just one position was really hard to find and my friend,<br/>British recorderist Geoff Walker helped at that point: he mailed me a<br/>scanned page from &quot;The Recorder Today&quot; by Eve O&apos;Kelly, indicating<br/>microtonal fingerings. The one I needed was there and the rest was<br/>compatible with what I had &apos;discovered&apos;.</p><p>AFAIK, I&apos;m the only musician who plays Turkish music on recorder. By<br/>now, I&apos;m able to play two Ney tunings (Bol&acirc;henk, the standard tuning<br/>for TM and Sip&uuml;rde, a tone lower than that) and &quot;Mansur&quot; (equivalent<br/>to Western pitch) as far as the instruments range allows. The rest of<br/>it is to be discovered now.</p><p>Cheers &amp; best,<br/>Ertugrul</p></div><h3>Afmmjr@aol.com</h3><span>4/19/2002 7:14:59 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Ertugrul,</p><p>Indeed the recorder can play any tuning, like any instrument can.  Keys were<br/>added to play in newer tunings, culminating in conventional 12-tET.  But all<br/>flutes can play all tunings.  Nay players often have a number of different<br/>instruments to use based on factors of pitch and scale.  By keeping your<br/>fingers connected to the air stream that exits the tone holes, one can even<br/>utilize zourna technique.  For zourna uses the second joint of the fingers<br/>rather than the fingertips.</p><p>But the quantum leap in controlling pitch on recorder was in figuring out how<br/>tape could make minute adjustments in pitch that freed up the fingers from<br/>the challenging new fingerings, or &quot;grippings&quot; as they can be imagined.  The<br/>tape frees the mind from the technique so that it can be entertained<br/>elsewhere.</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3>emotionaljourney22 &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>4/19/2002 12:51:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; But the quantum leap in controlling pitch on recorder was in<br/>figuring out how<br/>&gt; tape could make minute adjustments in pitch that freed up the<br/>fingers from<br/>&gt; the challenging new fingerings, or &quot;grippings&quot; as they can be<br/>imagined.

Persian Nay differs in timbre and<br/>hardware from the Turkish/Arabic one and resembles<br/>Anatolian &quot;kaval&quot;), I confirm. By that (ney) influence, I tend to use<br/>fingerjoints rather than tips for better effect on the pitch. I don&apos;t<br/>abandon using the fingertips, though.</p><p>Using fingerjoints helps with legato and glissandi wherever possible.</p><p>Best,<br/>Ertugrul</p></div>
