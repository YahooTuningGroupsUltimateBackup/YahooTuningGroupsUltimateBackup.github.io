Thak&apos;s for your help,<br/>&gt;                a little help is enogh for me again thanks Rodrigo</p><p>Hello Rodrigo...</p><p>Paul Erlich and some others are much better equipped to help you than I<br/>am, certainly, but I can point you in the direction of some excellent<br/>tuning-educational Websites that have been created by people right on<br/>this list (!!!)</p><p>My very favorite is one that seems to contain about everything,<br/>assembled by John Starrett:</p><p><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p><p>You really can find links to about anything we deal with here from that<br/>site.  It&apos;s pretty amazing.</p><p>The following locations are all on John Starrett&apos;s site as links, but I<br/>would like to point them out to you:</p><p>This is Graham Breed&apos;s great site... one of the most comprehensive on<br/>tuning, and one that most certainly will answer your questions on<br/>meantone:</p><p><a href="http://x31eq.com/index.html">http://x31eq.com/index.html</a></p><p>He has a great &quot;tuning for beginners&quot; page.</p><p>And, if you have any questions about definitions, there is Joe Monzo&apos;s<br/>incredible dictionary:</p><p><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p><p>You may find solace in Just Intonation, at the Just Intonation Network:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.dnai.com/~jinetwk/">http://www.dnai.com/~jinetwk/</a></p><p>And when you are ready to jump of the diving board into the water, like<br/>the other lemmings, you can finally go here:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com/index.html">http://www.anaphoria.com/index.html</a></p><p>Hope this helps!  Incredibly enough, a lot of this stuff has really not<br/>been organized into comprehensive resources, except for a few books,<br/>some of which are currently out of print!  The on-line resources seem<br/>practically as comprehensive as print books, and a lot more current.<br/>You will find bibilographies, however, on the sites I have mentioned<br/>above.</p><p>Happy surfing!</p><p>________________ ______ __ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
