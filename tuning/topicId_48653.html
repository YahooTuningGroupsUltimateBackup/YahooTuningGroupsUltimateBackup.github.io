But the more recent products such as SONAR are for my interests too huge and complex, I&apos;m only intersted into a good smooth MIDI-program in which I can create my .wrk-files. What I am missing in CakewalkExpress is e.g. the utility to inverse a musical structure (write c-e-g, mark it, inverse it either to g-e-c, or c-ab-f, or f-ab-c: do you get mthe idea ? I heard that Cubase does that sort of thing too, but here again I fell that is a too huge and complex program. Does anyone of you know &quot;CakewalkProfessional&quot;, to which my CakewalkExpress sometimes refers in its help file ?)<br/>Anyhow, if someone of you knows CakewalkProfessional or its immediate follower, please let me know. I feel I could use that.<br/>Thanks for your help.<br/>Bye<br/>Werner</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;monz@attglobal.net&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2003 8:32:31 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>hi Werner,</p><p>i use Cakewalk Pro 9.3 all the time.  it&apos;s mostly a great<br/>program, but is no longer available and has been superceded<br/>by SONAR.</p><p>but if your primary interest is in microtonal music,<br/>i (not-so-humbly) suggest that you wait a few more<br/>months and spend those big bucks on my software instead.<br/>:)</p><p>the company name is Tonalsoft ... we haven&apos;t made a<br/>final decision on the product name yet.  we&apos;re expecting<br/>the beta release to be out around February.</p><p>-monz</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Wernerlinden@a... wrote:<br/>&gt; hi there, ye friends in music,<br/>&gt; apparently some of you are using Cakewalk Products.<br/>&gt; As I recently pointed out, I am using the &quot;good old<br/>CakewalkExpress&quot;, and I am interested in any version of Cakewalk<br/>products that offer mor possibilities / utilities.
