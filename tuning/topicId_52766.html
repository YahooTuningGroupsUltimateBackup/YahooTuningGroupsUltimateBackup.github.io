He will use each of his newly introduced Trinity of Guitars<br/>in these concerts. His designs combine numerous features of western<br/>steel guitar technology in innovative ways to provide the expressive<br/>range and timbral qualities necessary for traditional indian music.</p><p>&quot;Debashish Bhattacharya&apos;s masterly performance of Raga <a href="http://Bhimpalasi.is">Bhimpalasi.is</a><br/>showing Viswa Mohan Bhatt&apos;s crown is about to be stolen by young<br/>prince - Bhattacharya - One of the truly most lyrical musicians<br/>playing in any style.&quot;<br/>---Dirty Linen, USA, September 1999</p><p>In February 2004 a master Classical musician, Debashish Bhattacharya,<br/>travelled to the other side of the earth from his native Kolkatta to<br/>pay homage to the renowned Hawaiian guitarist Tau Moe. Why would two<br/>obviously very different cultures share a musical history?</p><p>The idea of stopping strings with a slide as opposed to frets (as in<br/>the Sitar) or fingers (as in the Sarod) is very old. 5th century AD<br/>Ajanti cave paintings give glimpses of a one string instrument that<br/>was played with a bamboo slide. By the 20th century this kind of<br/>instrument was no longer in widespread use although the vichitra vina<br/>and gottuvadyam represent relatively recent (19th century) revivals<br/>of the slide technique.</p><p>Although there is some argument about who really started slide guitar<br/>in Hawaii, there are several important accounts of one Gabriel<br/>Davion,  a kidnapped Indian brought to Honolulu by a sea-captain. He<br/>is reported to have played slide guitar in the 1880&apos;s.  Like India,<br/>Hawaii has a long history of assimilation and adaption of a variety<br/>of musical instruments from foreign sources including many kinds of<br/>guitars from Spain, Mexico and Portugal. These have evolved into<br/>unique Hawaiian forms such as the ukulele, slack-key guitar and<br/>(incorporating the slide) the acoustic lap steel and the electric<br/>steel guitar.</p><p>In 1929, Tao Moe, master of this newly developing slide guitar<br/>performed extensively in India and settled in Kolkatta for many<br/>years. The popularity of his music and teachings  resulted in a small<br/>but fast growing school of performers of classical Indian guitar<br/>music.  At the forefront of these developments is Debashish<br/>Bhattacharya.</p><p>Unlike his peers, Debashish from the beginning strongly believed his<br/>guitar should have six strings, not three or four. By doing so he was<br/>able to include the bass strings and exploit the complete range of<br/>the instrument. In 1980 he emerged with a complete design of the<br/>instrument and importantly mastery of the requisite technique.<br/>Complete with the innovative additions of side Tarab (resonating<br/>string), front Chikari with six main strings and three supporting<br/>strings his instrument was ready to accept the challenges presented<br/>by Raga music. He evolved and pioneered the required finger style and<br/>technique to enable the guitar players to explore the heights of<br/>articulation to the standards of Indian classical Instrumental<br/>recital.</p><p>Although pioneering the development of new instruments and adapting a<br/>rich traditional music to them is a formidable and sometimes lonely<br/>task, Debashish has been heartily supported in important quarters<br/>notably by Ali Akbar Khan. After all the Sarod is only 150-200 years<br/>old.</p><p>Debashish Bhattacharya will be introducing his latest Trinity of<br/>Guitars to  students and music lovers in workshops and concerts in<br/>Berkeley, California. These are:</p><p>&gt;&gt;  The Chaturangui, a 24-string, hollow-neck Indian classical guitar<br/>&gt;&gt;that blends the tonal resonance of several Indian instruments<br/>&gt;&gt;(including the sitar) while also keeping the original sound of the<br/>&gt;&gt;guitar.</p><p>  &gt;&gt; The Gandharvi, a 12-string that combines the sound of the guitar<br/>with Indian classical instruments.</p><p>  &gt;&gt; The Anandi, a four-string Debashish describes as being similar to<br/>a Western slide ukulele, or small lute.</p><p>&quot;The instruments are derived from the Hawaiian steel guitar, but the<br/>structure and the tone has been developed in a way that it is the<br/>steel guitar plus something ... because if you play a foreign<br/>instrument in a foreign culture ... you will always be treated as a<br/>guest. That is what I didn&apos;t like being a guitarist -- that is why I<br/>have tried always to get a form of the slide guitar, which can have<br/>the access to the find the tradition of the style and technique of<br/>the instrumental technique of my country. That has been the entire<br/>focus of my life for the last 30 years.&quot;</p><p>     ---Debashsih Bhattacharya</p><p>This event is part of CNMAT&apos;s 2004 Guitar Innovators Series -- other<br/>events can be found here:<br/><a href="http://cnmat.cnmat.berkeley.edu/GIG/">http://cnmat.cnmat.berkeley.edu/GIG/</a></p><p>CNMAT is located at 1750 Arch Street, Berkeley, CA and is wheelchair<br/>accessible<br/>Map and directions: <a href="http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/Home/WhereisCNMAT.html">http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/Home/WhereisCNMAT.html</a><br/>CNMAT Calendar: <a href="http://www.cnmat.Berkeley.EDU/Calendar">http://www.cnmat.Berkeley.EDU/Calendar</a></p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>You received this message because you are a member of one of the<br/>mailing lists managed by CNMAT.
