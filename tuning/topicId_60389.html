Especially if they&apos;re<br/>always to one of your sites.

That way anyone interested<br/>in entering the field would be able to see which tunings might be of<br/>interest to him/her at a glance, based on the scales they support.<br/>Rather than having to wade through new sets of accidentals,<br/>temperament approximations to JI intervals, and whatever else might<br/>seem like ancient greek to them, they could ask &quot;which tunings support<br/>a recognizable 7-not diatonic scale?&quot; or &quot;which tunings support (some<br/>wacky scale idea impossible in 12)?&quot; and be answered with just a quick<br/>glance at a table.  Ideally the terminology would be logical and<br/>straightforward, and that after just a quick browse through the terms<br/>they could become instantly familiar.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Musicians need to be able to relate what they are learning about<br/>&gt; microtuning to what they are familiar with.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All Western musicians (who have earned the name musician) understand<br/>&gt; notenames, keys, traditional 12edo scales, and chains of fourths and<br/>&gt; fifths etc.</p><p>But not all microtonal scales (indeed, not even the majority) are<br/>compatible with traditional notenames, key signatures, chains of<br/>fourths and fifths, or 12edo scale shapes!  Not everyone enters the<br/>field looking for just a &quot;more in-tune&quot; alternative to 12-edo!  Some<br/>of us (i.e. myself) enter the field to try to get AS FAR AWAY from 12<br/>as possible!  For people like me, extensions of traditional approaches<br/>are not only undesirable but almost completely pointless and obfuscating.</p><p>&gt; Regardless of how sophisticated you make your mathematical<br/>&gt; manipulations ultimately microtuning is about music.<br/>&gt; Music is sound. It is played by musicians and heard by listeners.</p><p>I fully agree!  In case you haven&apos;t noticed, I am NOT a mathematician,<br/>a physicist, or even a very good musicial theoretician.  Most of this<br/>list is greek to me, and that is what I am trying to escape.</p><p>&gt; There seems to be a tendency on the tuning lists to try to make<br/>&gt; microtuning become very esoteric and exotic;</p><p>No one on this list is &quot;making&quot; microtuning into anything.  Everyone<br/>has their own take on it, and their own approach, and no one here is<br/>setting a universal standard.  The people whom you are referring to<br/>are mathematicians and scientists interested in certain aspects of<br/>microtuning, and they have cobbled together their own language to<br/>discuss these aspects.  What would you propose they do?  Force their<br/>discussions into the commonest of terms, and thus render it impossible<br/>to discuss the aspects that interest them?</p><p>&gt; In reality we are using lotsa fancy (sometimes new) names for<br/>&gt; concepts which are in essence very simple and obvious.<br/>&gt; e.g. LucyTuned, edo, brats, commas, diesis, etc.</p><p>All words have definitions which are longer than the word itself.  To<br/>keep everything in plain language, as you seem to desire, would<br/>require everyone to reiterate the definitions instead of the simple<br/>words picked to signify them, thus making the already-prolix posts on<br/>this forum all the more so.  We say &quot;comma&quot; so we don&apos;t have to say<br/>&quot;the really small interval that results when a chain of certain<br/>intervals fails to close at the octave&quot;.  This is why Monzo at<br/>tonalsoft compiled his Encyclopedia of Microtonal Music Theory (to<br/>which a link should be posted on every site that discuss microtuning,<br/>IMHO).</p><p>Rather than getting rid of these terms and over-simplifying this forum<br/>(which IS primarily esoteric, as well it should be), it would make<br/>more sense for someone to write a gentle beginner&apos;s guide to the<br/>microtonal world, one which contains only the minimal amount of math<br/>and emphasizes fairly universal logical terminology, with references<br/>to outside sources that go into greater mathematical detail on given<br/>topics.  Sort of a &quot;Microtuning for Dummies&quot;, which rather than<br/>focusing on a single system (like LucyTuning, 19-edo, Partch&apos;s 43-tone<br/>JI, or Catler&apos;s harmonic series-based scales) would open the door to<br/>all of them, though obviously not in great detail.</p><p>&gt; Is this to develop some professional mystique, or do we really want<br/>&gt; to &quot;change the (musical) world&quot;?</p><p>I&apos;m afraid what you have just stated is what we philosopher/logicians<br/>call the &quot;fallacy of false dichotomy&quot;.  Does the jargon of physicists,<br/>biologists, chemists, astronomers etc. prevent their breakthroughs<br/>from reaching public consciousness and changing the way the &quot;common<br/>people&quot; lead their lives?  Certainly not.  Music was once considered<br/>among the sciences, and the only reason this changed is because the<br/>powerful minority came to a conclusion about what music was supposed<br/>to be and agreed not to change it anymore, and then foisted this on<br/>the masses.  Thus all the science and skill that was required to<br/>understand music in its earlier years was no longer necessary for<br/>musicians.  Our societies came to believe that music is simple and<br/>shouldn&apos;t require much (or any) thinking.  It is impossible that any<br/>profound changes in the musical landscape should occur while this<br/>paradigm still dominates.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>-Igs</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Charles Lucy - lucy@h...<br/>&gt; ------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>&gt; for information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>&gt; for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>&gt; Buy/download/CD from: <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a></p></div><h3><a id=60410 href="#60410">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@cox.net&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2005 5:44:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot; &lt;igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; That is precisely my purpose, to make it easier for &quot;live&quot; musicians<br/>&gt; (such as myself).</p><p>... and a bunch of other stuff.
