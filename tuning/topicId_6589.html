She came up with a<br/>sliding shelf for the upper manual which permits it to be adjusted to<br/>taste for playing, and to be moved back in order to change settings on<br/>the lower manual (for example the choice of MIDI channel).</p><p>Having answered the basic survey question about hardware, maybe I<br/>should at this point explain that the rest of my remarks concern the<br/>kinds of music and tunings for which I use this system.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Conventional medieval/Renaissance music and &quot;split keys&quot;<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>For conventional medieval and Renaissance music, the built-in<br/>Pythagorean and 1/4-comma meantone tunings of the TX-802 cover the<br/>territory very nicely for me. In a standard 12-note tuning, what I am<br/>playing in effect is a usual two-manual organ or harpsichord, often<br/>with contrasting registrations for the two manuals (which can add to<br/>the contrapuntal interest).</p><p>For somewhat more experimental music, the &quot;part-tuning&quot; feature makes<br/>it easy to set up what I might call &quot;virtual split-key&quot; tunings with<br/>from 13 to about 16 notes per octave.</p><p>In these &quot;split-key&quot; tunings, I use the part-tuning feature in<br/>conjunction with the very nice option for transposing the built-in<br/>Pythagorean and meantone tunings to any desired position for the<br/>&quot;Wolf&quot; fifth or fourth. By setting the lower manual to a meantone<br/>tuning in Eb-G#, for example, and the upper manual to the same tuning<br/>in F-A#, I can perform the Prologue from the _Prophetiae Sibyllarum_<br/>of Orlando di Lasso. In effect, the two manuals provide split keys for<br/>Eb/D# and Bb/A#, the other notes remaining in unison.</p><p>Similarly, for some early 15th-century music, I&apos;ve found it very<br/>interesting to use a Pythagorean tuning with one manual in Eb-G# and<br/>the other in G-Bb -- permitting a choice of G#/Ab, C#/Db, and F#/Gb<br/>to produce, for example, either a regular Pythagorean third such as<br/>E-G# in a cadential resolution to D-A, or a smooth diminished fourth<br/>E-Ab in a prolonged noncadential sonority.</p><p>Managing these virtual split-key arrangements may take a bit of<br/>planned choreography at the keyboard in playing a piece, but permits<br/>enjoying the potential of 13-16 notes per octave while getting the<br/>benefits of an instrument with two contrasting manuals.</p><p>(Psychologically, 17 notes seems a point of transition, because all<br/>accidentals including Bb/A# will be different on the two keyboards --<br/>Bb representing an integral note in the medieval/Renaissance gamut, in<br/>contrast to the other accidentals which are regarded as &quot;devised&quot;<br/>additions or _musica ficta_.)</p><p>For the intonationally fastidious, one minor glitch of relying on<br/>these built-in transpositions is that a given note (e.g. F) may vary<br/>by one tuning unit (1/1024 octave or ~1.17 cents) in different<br/>transpositions. Thus certain unisons or octaves between notes on the<br/>two manuals may be off by 1.17 cents. One tuning expert has expressed<br/>the view that even a 1-cent error can definitely change the quality of<br/>a unison or octave, although another has commented to me that for most<br/>timbres, it might not be a big issue. I haven&apos;t noticed anything<br/>glaring so far when using these convenient transpositions, which might<br/>say something about my taste (or choice or registrations).</p><p>Another Renaissance tuning I&apos;m experimenting with is a 15-note scheme<br/>in 5-limit just intonation based on a keyboard described by Zarlino<br/>and discussed by Karol Berger. This is rather like the split-key<br/>schemes I describe above, except of course for the complications of<br/>having two flavors of D, Bb, and F# a syntonic comma (81:80, ~21.51<br/>cents) apart, and needing to keep track of which flavor is needed for<br/>a given sonority in a piece. For simple vocal pieces, where the<br/>keyboard choreography is not too impractical, this tuning is (now<br/>as then) a fascinating realization of pure ensemble intonation on a<br/>fixed-pitch instrument.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Xenharmonics, Renaissance (Vicentino) and Neo-Gothic<br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Moving into clearly xenharmonic Renaissance territory, I use custom<br/>tuning tables to define two varieties of 24-note meantone for<br/>Renaissance fifthtone music of the kind composed and advocated by<br/>Vicentino. In my &quot;standard&quot; 24-note archicembalo tuning, the lower<br/>manual is in a usual Eb-G# meantone, and the upper manual has a custom<br/>tuning a diesis of 128:125 (~41.06 cents) higher, or Eb*-Ab as I<br/>notate this (using a * to show a note raised by a diesis).</p><p>The second tuning is the same, except that the second manual has D# in<br/>place of Eb* -- slightly asymmetrical (Bb*-Ab plus D#), but<br/>conveniently leaving the standard manual in a usual Eb-G#. I have<br/>still to set up a third tuning required by one of Vicentino&apos;s pieces:<br/>Ab-C#/Ab*-Db. Maybe writing this article will encourage me to complete<br/>this task.</p><p>While these 24-note tunings are actually subsets of Vicentino&apos;s full<br/>36-note archicembalo, another 24-note tuning is a modern offshoot of<br/>Gothic music: Xeno-Gothic, with two 12-note Pythagorean tunings a<br/>Pythagorean comma apart (531441:524288, ~23.46 cents). To set this, I<br/>place the first manual in standard Pythagorean, Eb-G#, and the second<br/>manual in a custom tuning identical to this but a comma higher (very<br/>nicely approximated as 20 tuning units, or 20/1024 octave).</p><p>Just as Vicentino&apos;s archicembalo gives the usual intervals of<br/>Renaissance music plus some intriguing &quot;proximates&quot; (e.g. &quot;proximate<br/>minor thirds&quot; near 11:9, a diesis wider than the usual ones), so a<br/>Xeno-Gothic archicembalo gives usual medieval Pythagorean intervals<br/>plus &quot;proximates&quot; a comma wider than smaller.</p><p>As in Vicentino&apos;s &quot;Xeno-Renaissance&quot; system (as I might call it), so<br/>in this &quot;Xeno-Gothic&quot; system, the &quot;proximate&quot; intervals can supplement<br/>the usual ones in melodic progressions and in vertical sonorities.</p><p>A different kind of &quot;Neo-Gothic&quot; tuning I am exploring is 17-tone<br/>equal temperament, or 17-tet, set up with custom tuning tables placing<br/>the diatonic keys of both manuals in unison, but either mapping the<br/>&quot;standard&quot; medieval/Renaissance accidentals Eb-G# to one keyboard and<br/>the other five accidentals to the other, or mapping flats to one<br/>keyboard and sharps to the other.</p><p>For Gothic music, 17-tet tends to sound like an exaggerated<br/>Pythagorean -- exaggerated enough to make it a kind of xenharmonic<br/>realization, &quot;different&quot; and intriguing. Timbre can definitely shade<br/>this effect, with Yahama&apos;s built-in &quot;PuffPipes&quot; voice (A56), a bit<br/>like a portative organ, having a really pleasant effect for some<br/>14th-century styles.</p><p>This is a quick survey of &quot;tunings I have known,&quot; and maybe will put<br/>the hardware in a musical context.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div>
