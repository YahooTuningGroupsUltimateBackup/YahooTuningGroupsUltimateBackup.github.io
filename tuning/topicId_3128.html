I don&apos;t think a physics journal would<br/>&gt;publish a paper on perception of a beat note.</p><p>&gt;Let&apos;s say we have a flute at A440. And another at (perfect) E1320. The<br/>&gt;beat will be at A880, which does happen to be in the range. A beat can<br/>&gt;be either in or out of the range of the instruments creating it. In the<br/>&gt;range, it sounds corporeal. Outside the range, it sounds ethereal. I am<br/>&gt;stretching, but I think this is clear.</p><p>It sounds like a confusion between two different phenomena here.<br/>There is the &quot;beat rate&quot; and the &quot;difference frequency&quot;.<br/>They are obviously closely related conceptually,<br/>but they are most likely caused by different<br/>perceptual mechanisms. This is discussed at length in</p><p>D. E. Hall, &grave;&grave;The difference between difference tones and rapid beats,&quot;<br/>American Journal of Physics, 49(7), pp. 632-636, July 1981</p><p>which may or may not be the article your physics teacher was<br/>referring to.</p></div>
