I<br/>would think maybe Liszt piano music, myself.  Rachmaninov gets<br/>pretty &quot;experimental&quot; in some of his very late works... but so does<br/>Liszt, come to think of it.  I don&apos;t know if *either* is as totally<br/>wedded to the keyboard as you might thing.  But more on this<br/>on &quot;Metatuning...&quot;</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
