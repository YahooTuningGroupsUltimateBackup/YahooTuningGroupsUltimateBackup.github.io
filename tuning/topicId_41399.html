I can&apos;t stream from them either for some<br/>reason. Try to download the song, or if that fails, go to my web site<br/>and find the Mirror Walk page. You can download the whole song there<br/>using right mouse click, save to file. This should work. I can only<br/>post one at a time there, and it does not track the number of<br/>downloads, but it has the nice attribute of actually working.</p><p>Prent Rodgers<br/>Mercer Island, WA</p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:PrentRodgers@attbi.com">PrentRodgers@attbi.com</a><br/>Home Page: <a href="http://home.attbi.com/~prodgers13/">http://home.attbi.com/~prodgers13/</a><br/>Music: <a href="http://www.mp3.com/PrentRodgers">http://www.mp3.com/PrentRodgers</a></p><p>&quot;It&apos;s cold, but it&apos;s a damp cold.&quot;</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E; &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>12/8/2002 1:32:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is anyone else having difficulty streaming mp3s?
