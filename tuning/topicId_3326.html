Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@xxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>6/4/1999 12:51:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, and I&apos;d like to respond to some comments by Joe Monzo on<br/>issues regarding the use of Pythagorean tuning in medieval European<br/>music, both plainsong and polyphony.</p><p>Please let me state at the outset that the following remarks focus on<br/>written music which has come down to us, especially liturgical chant and<br/>various types of polyphonic compositions. Traditional musics of Europe in<br/>the medieval era, as later, may have used various intonational systems.</p><p>&gt; And it *is* possible to perform plainchant in a JI scale with<br/>&gt; *every* note consonant with those already being heard - it just<br/>&gt; wouldn&apos;t be a type of scale that we usually recognize as a &apos;basic&apos;<br/>&gt; scale.</p><p>Here I might have a couple of different responses.</p><p>First, just about any chant will have melodic semitones, regarded when<br/>they occur as simultaneous intervals as dissonances in just about any<br/>system of Western European composition before around 1900. Many chants<br/>also have prominent tritone relations, e.g. between F and B-natural in<br/>G Mixolydian (Modes 7 and 8, or _tetrardus_). A minor second has been<br/>regarded as a strong dissonance whether tuned at 256:243 (~90 cents),<br/>16:15 (~112 cents), 1/4-comma meantone (~117 cents), etc. These<br/>tunings may vary the degree of dissonance, of course.</p><p>Secondly, it might be relevant to point out that degrees of &quot;concord&quot;<br/>are a product of musical context as much as acoustics. Even if tuned<br/>in meantone or 5-limit JI, thirds and sixths would be unstable in a<br/>medieval setting rather than &quot;fully concordant&quot; simply because the<br/>musical language treats them thus, and attuned listeners respond in<br/>accordance with the language&apos;s expectations. Similarly, if one<br/>attempted to make Bach&apos;s or Beethoven&apos;s triadic harmonies &quot;richer&quot; by<br/>adding pure 7:4&apos;s where stable triads are expected, this would be<br/>&quot;ungrammatical,&quot; however attractive from the viewpoint of 7-limit JI<br/>as a goal in itself.</p><p>&gt; This really doesn&apos;t have much bearing on the question anyway,<br/>&gt; because by the time period under consideration, unaccompanied<br/>&gt; monodic plainchant had mostly disappeared from the church rituals.</p><p>Here I must respectfully disagree. While polyphony indeed became more<br/>and more common during the later medieval era, plainsong remained a<br/>vital basis of the liturgy. Indeed, the many hymn settings by<br/>composers of the 15th century -- the period of transition from 3-limit<br/>to 5-limit on the Continent -- featuring the alternation of plainsong<br/>and polyphony nicely symbolize the interaction of these two<br/>forms. Dufay (1397?-1474) comes especially to mind.</p><p>Further, this interaction is suggested by the fact that, for example,<br/>a polyphonic Mass setting of the Gloria opens with a plainsong<br/>intonation of _Gloria in excelsis Deo_, the polyphony beginning<br/>on the words _Et in terra pax_.</p><p>While it might be argued that the Renaissance practice of chant had<br/>become &quot;corrupted&quot; -- and in the late 16th century, Palestrina was<br/>commissioned to reform this practice -- plainsong continued alongside<br/>polyphony in the liturgy.</p><p>&gt; Since the Ars Nova movement in Paris in the 1200s, most church music<br/>&gt; thruout Europe had become quite emphatically polyphonic.</p><p>The term &quot;Ars Nova&quot; (New Art) refers to a movement dating to around<br/>the beginning of the 14th century in France (e.g. Philippe de Vitry,<br/>Johannes de Muris) and Italy (e.g. Marchettus de Padua). The late 13th<br/>century, in contrast, was now known as the &quot;Ars Antiqua&quot; (Old Art) or<br/>&quot;Ars Veterum&quot; (&quot;Art of the Ancients&quot;).</p><p>Actually, both liturgical and secular music played a role in both<br/>movements -- especially if we take Ars Antiqua to include the whole<br/>13th century, and also the end of the 12th century, including the<br/>great liturgical works of Perotin and his colleagues for three and<br/>four voices.</p><p>By the late 13th century, the main focus was on the motet, a form<br/>which could have liturgical applications, and was certainly popular in<br/>clerical circles (see Johannes de Grocheio, c. 1300), but often had a<br/>secular focus.</p><p>Interestingly, one trend of the 14th century was a growing practice of<br/>polyphonic settings for the Ordinary of the Mass, Machaut&apos;s Mass being<br/>one famous example. However, while these settings indeed made<br/>polyphony a more and more prominent element in the liturgy, they did<br/>not make plainsong obsolete, as can be heard, for example, in some<br/>modern performances of Machaut&apos;s Mass including also plainsong items<br/>to accompany the composer&apos;s settings of the Ordinary.</p><p>&gt; Of course, Marchetto of Padua in 1318 discussed the use of intervals<br/>&gt; smaller than the &apos;standard&apos; Pythagorean semitones.  But because of<br/>&gt; his obscure numerical descriptions, exactly what he meant is not<br/>&gt; entirely clear.  See [plug alert]:</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm</a></p><p>From the view of a 3-limit vs. 5-limit debate, my take on Marchettus<br/>seems similar to that of Mark Lindley and Karol Berger: his approach,<br/>however unorthodox, fits in nicely with a general preference in the<br/>14th-century for some approximation of Pythagorean intonation with<br/>wide major thirds and sixths, and narrow diatonic semitones.</p><p>&gt; There is also evidence suggesting that the shift from Pythagorean to<br/>&gt; Just was already in process in English popular music as early as the<br/>&gt; 1200s (see Walter Odington and Theinred of Dover).</p><p>Here we are in agreement, and I might add that actual music from<br/>certain English sources in this period indeed shows a pervasive use of<br/>thirds nicely corroborating the remarks of these theorists (_Sumer is<br/>icumen in_ being the most famous example, and some religious settings<br/>in Latin also concluding on sonorities with thirds). Around 1275(?),<br/>Coussemaker&apos;s Anonymous IV remarks that in the &quot;Westcountry&quot; of<br/>England, thirds are esteemed as the &quot;best concords,&quot; a remark again<br/>fitting the musical evidence. I might add that there is considerable<br/>variation in 13th-century English styles, some being more similar to<br/>those on the Continent, where Pythgorean tuning would seem ideal in<br/>theory and practice.</p><p>By the way, personally I would prefer to regard Pythagorean (3-limit)<br/>as one of the many forms of Just intonation -- but I realize that<br/>&quot;Just&quot; often implies 5-limit or higher. Maybe arguing such fine points<br/>of usage, where the meaning is clear enough in either usage, is a bit<br/>like arguing about English spelling &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>&gt; So based on my historical knowledge, it appears that the use of<br/>&gt; polyphony, the tuning shift from 3- to 5-limit in &apos;serious&apos; music,<br/>&gt; and the building of Gothic cathedrals, are all intertwined, taking<br/>&gt; place largely during the 1200s and 1300s.</p><p>For polyphonic music on the Continent in the Gothic and Renaissance<br/>and Manneristic eras, I would suggest this rough timetable:</p><p>Pythagorean, usual flats and sharps                  1200-1400<br/>Pythagorean, sharps often tuned as flats             1400-1450<br/>5-limit JI or meantone for keyboards                 1450-1650</p><p>In this chronology, regular Pythagorean tuning is the norm for the<br/>13th and 14th centuries. In the late Ars Nova, however -- maybe as<br/>early as 1370-1380 in certain places such as Florence -- there was<br/>apparently a movement to tune Pythagorean sharps as flats, converting<br/>the usual wide major thirds (very effective in cadences to stable<br/>intervals) into diminished fourths or &quot;schisma thirds&quot; (8192:6561)<br/>only ~1.95 cents from a pure 5:4.</p><p>Mark Lindley documents this movement as it manifests in early<br/>15th-century keyboard music, and also possibly some vocal music around<br/>the epoch of the young Dufay. As a result both of internal<br/>developments in style on the Continent, and the English influence<br/>possibly linked to the occupation of France after the battle of<br/>Agincourt (1415), both the more pervasive use of thirds and sixths,<br/>and a certain fascination with the altered Pythagorean forms of these<br/>intervals, followed.</p><p>By around 1450, as Lindley argues, keyboard compositions such as those<br/>of Conrad Paumann seem to invite a meantone tuning where all the<br/>regular thirds -- not just four in each octave -- can be pure or<br/>near-pure.</p><p>In 1482, Ramos appears to describe a meantone keyboard tuning as well<br/>as his famous 5-limit just intonation scheme.</p><p>As Joe Monzo very aptly notes, theory during the late 15th and early<br/>16th century was in a state of flux. Writers such as Gaffurius took<br/>Pythagorean tuning as their theoretical model, although noting that in<br/>practice other schemes prevailed -- for example, the narrowing of<br/>fifths on keyboards.</p><p>My own view on this tension between theory and practice around 1500<br/>might be similar to that of Carl Dahlhaus and Mark Lindley. In<br/>medieval practice, the melodic ideal of narrow diatonic semitones and<br/>the harmonic ideal of active thirds and sixths &quot;striving&quot; toward<br/>stable 3-limit intervals were in equilibrium. With the 15th-century<br/>shift toward thirds and sixths as primary concords, however, the new<br/>harmonic style required wider leading-tones -- and it took theorists a<br/>bit of time to accept that the _major_ semitone was now the normal<br/>diatonic interval.</p><p>Also, I would agree with Joe Monzo that Zarlino (1558) and Lippius<br/>(1610, 1612) were two leading advocates of the &quot;syntonic diatonic&quot;<br/>tuning of Ptolemy with its pure thirds and sixths. It&apos;s interesting<br/>that these two theorists were also champions of _harmonia perfetta_<br/>(Zarlino) or the _trias harmonica_ (Lippius) -- that is, the complete<br/>5-limit harmony of third plus fifth or sixth, to which Lippius gave<br/>the name &quot;triad&quot; -- as a central element of good composition.</p><p>Here Bill Alves might welcome my adding that Nicola Vicentino (1555)<br/>also championed the syntonic diatonic, while pragmatically advocating<br/>a system of 31-tone equal temperament as the standard for its<br/>realization in an &quot;Aristoxenian&quot; manner. This theorist&apos;s modern<br/>editors Maria Rika Maniates and Claude V. Palisca, mention Fogliano as<br/>a likely source for some of Vicentino&apos;s teachings regarding pure<br/>thirds and sixths. Also, Vicentino formulated the rule that<br/>a composition for three or more voices should wherever possible have<br/>complete 5-limit sonorities -- three years before the publication of<br/>Zarlino&apos;s more extensive treatment of this point.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3><a id=3347 href="#3347">ðŸ”—</a>monz@xxxx.xxx</h3><span>6/6/1999 12:26:37 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks to Margo Schulter for providing detail for what I only<br/>skimmed over.</p><p>I would like to emphasize that her dating of the shift<br/>from Pythagorean to 5-limit tuning in European music follows<br/>the orthodox views more closely than mine, thus explaining<br/>some of our differences of opinion.</p><p>I am firmly convinced that the singing of 5-limit intervals<br/>either never went out of use in Europe once it was described by<br/>the ancient Greeks, or, if it did go out of use, it was only<br/>during a few centuries immediately after the German invasions<br/>of the late 400s AD.</p><p>At present, the only references I can cite to back this claim<br/>are a few postings I&apos;ve made to this forum, and my own book.</p><p>But hopefully in the next few months, I&apos;ll have a webpage<br/>finished which explains a diatonic system described by Boethius<br/>as Pythagorean, but the Greek-letter notation of which (provided<br/>by Boethius himself) seems to indicate a differentiation between<br/>two tones separated by a syntonic comma [~21.5 cents] but an<br/>equation of two tones separated by a skhisma [~1.95 cents].<br/>This describes what amounts to a skhismatic-tempered version<br/>of a 5-limit JI system.</p><p>As far as the issue of polyphony, Margo is correct in that<br/>I may have argued too strongly for an &apos;early death of plainchant&apos;<br/>in the cathedrals of Europe.</p><p>The earliest indisputable description of polyphony is in the<br/>_musica enchiriadis_, which has been dated to approximately 900 AD.</p><p>In some churches at the present time, monophonic plainchant can<br/>still be found in use during the Mass or service.</p><p>Some years ago, I wrote a paper comparing Schutz&apos;s and Bach&apos;s<br/>settings of the _St John Passion_, at the beginning and end,<br/>respectively, of the Baroque period in music.

Even if this is the<br/>*minimum* delay in theorist&apos;s recognition of actual intonational<br/>practice, four centuries is a long time.</p><p>This shows more than anything the stranglehold that received<br/>theoretical doctrine can have on even &apos;progressive&apos; music<br/>theory.  I think this historical &apos;lock on Pythagoreanism&apos;<br/>was far worse than the current &apos;lock on 12-eq&apos; that we&apos;re<br/>dealing with.  At any rate, it lasted for a much longer time.</p><p>No intrinsic evaluation of Pythagorean tuning in itself<br/>is implied by my use of the word &apos;worse&apos; - it&apos;s the situation of<br/>an *unconscious mental limitation* that I&apos;m describing as &apos;worse&apos;.<br/>:)</p><p>I speak on this based on my own first-hand experience.  My ears<br/>told my brain all along that the 12-eq scale was inadequate<br/>for describing what I was hearing when I listened to music,<br/>but my conservatory training (strictly 12-eq) and book learning,<br/>until encountering Partch&apos;s _Genesis_, never gave me a clue<br/>that this was the case.  That&apos;s why I used to have so much<br/>trouble trying to play the blues correctly: I was thinking of<br/>it entirely in terms of the 12-eq scale, which just doesn&apos;t<br/>work for the real low-down blues.</p><p>Of course, learning about microtones made it possible for me<br/>to give an excruciatingly accurate analysis of a blues song<br/>recorded 60 years ago by a musician who had no &apos;formal&apos; training<br/>in music-theory at all.</p><p>IMO, this is an exact analogy to the situation in the 1300s,<br/>when European theorists re-discovered the ancient Greek treatises<br/>filled with non-Pythagorean ratios, and applied the concepts and<br/>measurements to the music that was already being made all around<br/>them.</p><p>-monz</p><p>PS - Please give the citation for Mark Linley&apos;s study of<br/>14th-century keyboard music.

It is highly doubtful to me that 5-limit ratios had any<br/>importance in unaccompanied singing, at least outside of huge reverberant<br/>caves or Gothic cathedrals.</p><p>&gt;If they were sharpening these intervals in accordance with their<br/>&gt;understanding of the compositional treatment, as Margo suggests,<br/>&gt;they were probably singing other less-dissonant 5-limit intervals<br/>&gt;that made the intervals even wider than the Pythagorean ratios;</p><p>Huh? That makes sense for a minor third (6:5 is wider than 32:27), but for a<br/>major third, what less-dissonant 5-limit tuning is even wider than<br/>Pythagorean?</p><p>&gt;Altho I would consent that the above is possible, I still think<br/>&gt;it very unlikely that a group of unaccompanied singers will<br/>&gt;*not* sing simultaneous &apos;major 3rds&apos; as 5:4, &apos;minor 3rds&apos; as<br/>&gt;6:5, &apos;minor 6ths&apos; as 8:5, or &apos;major 6ths&apos; as 5:3.</p><p>&gt;According to the extant manuscripts, simultaneous harmonies<br/>&gt;were first used in music around 800 or 900, and I would argue<br/>&gt;that from that time onward, unless they were accompanied by<br/>&gt;a Pythagorean-tuned organ, the choir sang 5-limit JI.</p><p>&gt;If this is correct, then there is a lag of *at least* 400 years<br/>&gt;until Marchetto caught up with practice in his theoretical<br/>&gt;description, and that&apos;s only if I&apos;m correct in thinking that<br/>&gt;Marchetto was describing 5-limit JI.  Even if this is the<br/>&gt;*minimum* delay in theorist&apos;s recognition of actual intonational<br/>&gt;practice, four centuries is a long time.</p><p>&gt;This shows more than anything the stranglehold that received<br/>&gt;theoretical doctrine can have on even &apos;progressive&apos; music<br/>&gt;theory.  I think this historical &apos;lock on Pythagoreanism&apos;<br/>&gt;was far worse than the current &apos;lock on 12-eq&apos; that we&apos;re<br/>&gt;dealing with.  At any rate, it lasted for a much longer time.</p><p>I totally disagree with all of this but have little to add to Margo&apos;s<br/>arguments.</p><p>&gt;I speak on this based on my own first-hand experience.  My ears<br/>&gt;told my brain all along that the 12-eq scale was inadequate<br/>&gt;for describing what I was hearing when I listened to music,</p><p>I hate to say it but music of 1000 years ago was totally different from, and<br/>probably tuned totally differently from, music of today. There was a<br/>&quot;paradigm shift&quot; at one point when thirds and sixths moved from dissonant to<br/>consonant, and this is clear in the grammar of the musical examples that<br/>have survived. IMO, 5-limit ratios would have sounded as wrong 1000 years<br/>ago as 7- and 9-limit intervals sound to most musicians today.</p></div>
