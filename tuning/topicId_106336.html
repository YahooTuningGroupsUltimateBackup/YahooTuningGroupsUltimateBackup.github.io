There&apos;s the ones that use neutral and major seconds only, like the &quot;pure&quot; neutral third MOS, which is almost never used in any cultures around the world as far as i know: C D- E- F G A- B- C</p><p> And the altered version, which is more common, known as Maqam Rast among other names:<br/> C D E- F G A B- C</p><p> Then there&apos;s the ones that use minor and supermajor seconds as well, which are the most interesting ones out of the bunch.</p><p> This seems to be known as the &quot;soft diatonic&quot; according to several sources, but i can&apos;t seem to figure out if or where it has ever been used. From what i can see, it seems to be more of a theoretical construct that has never been used for actual music:</p><p> C Db D+ F G Ab A+ C</p><p> Then there&apos;s the other variants, one which can be called the inverse soft diatonic:</p><p> C D+ E F G A+ B C</p><p> And two more, inverses of each other:</p><p> C Db E- F G Ab B- C</p><p> C D- E F G A- B C</p><p> Does anyone know if any of these modes have been used, or at least described before? What name were they given, if any?</p><p> /&Ouml;</p></div>
