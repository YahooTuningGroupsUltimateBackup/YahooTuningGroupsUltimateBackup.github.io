I have a set of recordings of Buddy Emmons, Lenny Breau, Buddy<br/>Charleton and Leon Rhodes at the St. Louis Holliday Inn that will drop the<br/>jaws of any steel guitar or guitar players. These are all recorded with<br/>the knowledge of the players and are not available commercially. In the<br/>interest of education, I am willing to swap CDs of these recordings with<br/>list members who can offer me music I have not heard. No exchange of money<br/>please.</p><p>John Starrett<br/><a href="http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html">http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~jstarret/microtone.html</a></p></div>
