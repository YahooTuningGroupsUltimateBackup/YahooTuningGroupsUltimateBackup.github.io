I&apos;m not quite sure why this is</p><p>Well, meantone was basically designed to be a COFT for music using 7 or more<br/>consecutive notes on the chain of fifths. Scarlatti&apos;s music certainly falls<br/>into that category, as does most of the music that preceded him since the<br/>invention of meantone.</p><p>Or was there something in particular that made the meantone result<br/>surprising?</p></div>
