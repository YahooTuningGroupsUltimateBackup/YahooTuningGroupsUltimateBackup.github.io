It means best adapted, not best in a general sense. So it&apos;s likely that &quot;cent&quot; will survive due to its familiarity and long history, pretty much the same reasons that Microsoft is still dominant. &quot;Tina&quot; may be better for some purposes; &quot;millioctave&quot; for others. But so many articles and books use &quot;cent&quot; that anyone interested in tuning will still need to know it, and many probably won&apos;t have a need for anything else.</p></div>
