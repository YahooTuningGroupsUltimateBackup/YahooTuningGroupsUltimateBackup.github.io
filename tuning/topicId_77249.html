I believe Gene&apos;s approach was something like:</p><p>1. Infer a generator/period mapping for the scale used in<br/>the original MIDI file.  If you only want to change the<br/>generator you can just do the generator mapping, e.g.<br/>+0 -5 +2 -3 +4 -1 +6 +1 -4 -2 +5 for 12-ET.</p><p>2. Change the generator, e.g. from 3/2 to 7/4.  If the<br/>scale in step 1 is based chord like 0 +4 +1, it helps if<br/>it&apos;s still consonant under the new generator.</p><p>3. Use the new generator and the mapping in step 1 to<br/>create a scale.</p><p>4.

I like the original and minor swap versions<br/>&gt; very much.</p><p>When I was making the &quot;mmswap&quot; scale that day, the only thing I was sure about was that the 25/24 steps would go in opposite directions compared to the original version. But when I heard it a while later, my first conclusion was that syntonic comma shifts could be nicely explained by comparing to accidentals. At that moment, I found it clearly &quot;audible&quot; that a step of 81/80 became 135/128 after swapping major and minor and that a 135/128 step became 81/80. So you have, for example, two pitches for Ab, the lower of which is the replacement for A, the higher one being the replacement for A#.</p><p>&gt; Next I would say trinv2 worked pretty well.</p><p>Maybe it&apos;s because fifths are replaced by, in fact, octave-inverted fifths. It sounds a bit like if the music was inverted in general with the exception that major chords don&apos;t become minor ones and that there are some octave transpositions because 5/4 is replaced with 5/3 instead of 5/6. Anyway, general inversion seems to work nicely as well -- though I didn&apos;t include this version in the archive, I also used &quot;Invert&quot; and &quot;Reverse&quot; with the &quot;Euler.scl&quot; loaded in Scala, which turned all the ratios into their reciprocals. The only disadvantage was that this made flutes play lower than the other instruments (and therefore difficult to hear in some moments) but the harmonic progressions were nicely mirrored and easy to follow.</p><p>&gt; I never realized how good a patch the GM Rhodes is (at<br/>&gt; least with my synth) for this kind of thing. Usually<br/>&gt; with Scala I use Reed Organ, Clarinet, Percussive Organ,<br/>&gt; stuff like that.</p><p>I would be particularly interested to hear what the &quot;odd2&quot; version sounds like with your equipment -- do you think you could made an audio recording for me somehow?</p><p>&gt; You may also like to try some of Gene&apos;s transforms,<br/>&gt; as seen here:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_43689.html#43703">/tuning/topicId_43689.html#43703</a><br/>&gt; and here:<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_43689.html#43704">/tuning/topicId_43689.html#43704</a></p><p>Gene&apos;s transforms offer the advantage of all fifths being playable, which is, as he sais himself, the same as in meantone. That includes, as I can see, also the case where meantone turns into superpelog. And that is also why he used mavila when he changed a major third up to a minor third down and so on. Interestingly, when I first thought of the idea of swapping minor and major two years ago like in the case of &quot;mmswap&quot;, it didn&apos;t occur to me at all that I could also do something similar by heavily tempering the fifths -- for one thing, I was not thinking about temperaments as I was doing all of that in terms of 5-limit JI; for another thing, I considered such fifths &quot;too mistuned&quot; at that time so I probably wouldn&apos;t have done it even if I had knownthat something like mavila existed; and then, I considered &quot;euler.scl&quot; a rank 3 tuning so I thought it was appropriate to use the same approach for remapping the intervals. Rethinking all of this two years later, I&apos;m realizing that this allowed me to use mappings you could never &quot;audibly&quot; approximate with rank 2 temperaments, which is a great advantage in favor of this method. The only disadvantage I&apos;m finding here, at least for the time being, is that you can&apos;t view the original D-A and F#-C# as fifths because they are a comma narrower and have different meaning than a 3/2. But anyway, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s any difficult not to play them.</p><p>&gt; Oh, and did you retune these with Scala?

I just needed some music which went through the keys of C major, E major, E minor, and possibly G# minor (and since I didn&apos;t seem to have any piece which could meet my requirement, I made one). In the end, the first version (where some parts were played by different instruments and where the G# minor really was used) didn&apos;t sound so nice to my ear so I made a second version (the one I&apos;ve sent you) with a different ending, which eventually resulted in stripping the G# minor modulation. I&apos;m still hoping to make another &quot;semi-improv&quot; one day where a modulation into G# minor will find its way.</p><p>Petr</p></div>
