Boy, I am glad you mentioned this!  I definitely<br/>should have included something about it in my post, because<br/>it&apos;s a *very* important aspect of jazz harmony!</p><p>For those unfamiliar, what Neil is talking about here is<br/>referred to as &quot;tritone substitution&quot;.  It&apos;s one of the<br/>most interesting things one finds in jazz harmony.</p><p>Two chords with roots a tritone apart will both have in<br/>common as a pair of chord-members notes which themselves<br/>form the same tritone interval.</p><p>Neil&apos;s example illustrates an inversion of a G-dominant-7th<br/>chord with a &quot;flat 5&quot;, where the &quot;flat 5&quot; is in the bass,<br/>for instance:</p><p>C  B   B<br/>A  G   G<br/>F  F   E<br/>D  Db  C</p><p>But note that if one substitutes a Db-dominant-7th-flat-5<br/>for the G, it&apos;s exactly the same chord with different<br/>enharmonic spelling!:</p><p>C  Cb  B<br/>A  Abb G<br/>F  F   E<br/>D  Db  C</p><p>This idea of tritone substitution *probably* originated<br/>in late-1800s German/Austrian theory, but the earliest<br/>recognition of it that I am absolutely sure of is by...<br/>once again, my man Schoenberg.</p><p>This is a prime example that Paul Erlich would use to<br/>argue that many typical jazz harmonies are only possible<br/>in 12-EDO.</p><p>... Except that Paul would probably call it &quot;12-tET&quot;, which,<br/>BTW, brings up *that* issue.  In jazz, my first thought<br/>would be definitely to almost always call the tuning 12-EDO,<br/>because I don&apos;t see it as a temperament of any implied<br/>JI sonorities.

Tritone substitution in 12-tET makes use of the fact<br/>that the third and seventh of a dominant seventh chord are the same<br/>as the seventh and third of a dominant seventh chord a tritone lower<br/>(or higher). In 22-tET, the considerably more consonant &quot;dominant<br/>seventh chords&quot; still have this feature, since 7:5 and 10:7 are both<br/>represented by the same half-octave (i.e., the 50:49 comma vanishes).<br/>In fact, the symmetrical decatonic scales in 22-tET are _identical_<br/>when transposed by a half-octave, so they&apos;re inherently _bitonal_<br/>scales (in the sense of Stravinsky simultaneously using two<br/>tonalities a tritone apart).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...

I understand this and agree.  My whole concept<br/>&gt; &gt; of finity (and xenharmonic bridges) is based on this idea.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Paul]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I see it as different. For example, I don&apos;t hear the 256:243<br/>&gt; (Pythagorean limma) as a &quot;bridge&quot; in the sense that two pitches<br/>&gt; separated by this interval are the same pitch class. But when<br/>&gt; the limma is spread over many consonant intervals, the two<br/>&gt; pitches become identical, and thus each can participate in<br/>&gt; a larger number of consonant relationships with other notes.<br/>&gt; This happens, for example, in Herman Miller&apos;s 15-tET music.</p><p>Hmmm... are you saying that in Herman&apos;s 15-tET pieces the<br/>limma is a vanishing unison-vector?</p><p>I&apos;d still like to do a lot more thinking about xenharmonic<br/>bridges, and hone my definition(s) of what they are.  But<br/>generally, the limma is way too big for me to consider it<br/>to be a bridge.  Pitches that far apart are generally not<br/>perceived as the same... with some exceptions of course.</p><p>(A related example that comes to mind is one I&apos;ve discussed<br/>before which just popped up today in Neil&apos;s post: the<br/>substitution of the flat-5 for the regular &quot;perfect 5th&quot; in<br/>a chord in jazz.  I say &quot;related&quot; because of course this<br/>difference is not a Pythagorean limma = ~90 cents, but a<br/>12-EDO semitone = 100 cents.)</p><p>But usually I think of bridges as really small intervals<br/>where we really don&apos;t perceive the unique JI identites<br/>as they are actually tuned, but rather as some other ratio<br/>which is either implied by the harmonic context or is<br/>more familiar because of an individual&apos;s listening experience.</p><p>As you pointed out to me, my concept of bridges is not<br/>quite the same as Fokker&apos;s unison-vectors.
