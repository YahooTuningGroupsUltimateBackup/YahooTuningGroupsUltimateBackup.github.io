It is<br/>29&quot; wide X 24&quot; deep. To see the Maxi click on photos on the<br/>menu to the left.</p><p>The Maxi is composed of 6 modified 49 key midi keyboard controllers.<br/>Each segment has 25 front and 24 back white keys of which none are<br/>raised. The keys have been shortened. The octave range can vary and<br/>a method for marking the octaves has been implemented. Because I<br/>want to have many octaves in the 49 key range I will limit my<br/>octaves from a low 5 keys to a high 10 Keys per octave. Weird?</p><p>The six midi outs from the keyboards are inputted into the USB<br/>MidiSport 8X8 inputs. I will put each of the six segments on a midi<br/>channel one through six. Each channel will play a different VSTi.</p><p>The keyboards are grouped in pairs so that each set of two keyboards<br/>face each other. My first problem is that keyboard 1, 3 and 5 are<br/>reversed so in a sense are played from behind. On 1, 3 and 5, the<br/>key number 36 is on the right side and key number 84 is on the left.<br/>These three keyboards have to have the key numbers inverted so that<br/>low notes are on the left. This set up needs to be made the default.<br/>What is the best way to do this?</p><p>Once all six 49 key keyboards have the low notes on the left, I will<br/>need to map one keyboard to my specifications and copy the map to<br/>the other five, so that all six 49 key keyboards are mapped the<br/>same. Do I use the drum mapper for this?</p><p>I have Windows XP and Cubase SX. This is easy to do in Logic which I<br/>want to avoid as they no longer support the PC version. I will<br/>however consider switching sequencer if VST is included and it has<br/>the capacity to play six VST instruments simultaneously.</p><p>At this point I am not interested in microtonality.</p><p>To invert the key numbers on keyboards number 1, 3 and 5 I am<br/>looking for a software solution, preferably a plug-in. I will also<br/>consider hardware solution. Your help will be appreciated to resolve<br/>both mapping issues.</p><p>Kalamata Kid</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@lumma.org&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2003 10:52:25 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, Kalamata Kid!</p><p>&gt;I made a 294 key two dimensional midi keyboard.

This set up needs to be made the default.<br/>&gt;What is the best way to do this?</p><p>I&apos;m not the best one to answer this, but one way would be to pick<br/>VST synths that support microtunings.  It&apos;s my understanding that<br/>with the MIDI Tuning Standard, one can map any pitches in any<br/>order to MIDI notes.  You&apos;ll just be using 12-et pitches, but for<br/>the instances of the synth that are listening to the backwards<br/>keyboards, you can just reverse the order of the piteches in your<br/>tun file, or whatever.</p><p>If you like FM, BigTick&apos;s &quot;Rhino&quot; supports tun files, and list<br/>member Rick McGowan runs many instances of it at once.  You do need<br/>a lot of RAM.</p><p>Does anyone have anything to add here?</p><p>&gt;Once all six 49 key keyboards have the low notes on the left, I will<br/>&gt;need to map one keyboard to my specifications and copy the map to<br/>&gt;the other five, so that all six 49 key keyboards are mapped the<br/>&gt;same.

I downloaded the<br/>&gt;demo, but can&apos;t see how to make it work for me.</p><p>From MMM...</p><p>&gt;I use a MIDI keyboard, input through Finale which sends MIDI<br/>&gt;output via Midi yoke to VAZ Modular //<br/>&gt;I use an Aureal Vortex sound card. It is full duplex, so I can<br/>&gt;record the sound card&apos;s output with CoolEdit, which is sometimes<br/>&gt;useful. But // I have recently been capturing the audio output<br/>&gt;just by using the &quot;Capture&quot; command in VAZ Modular and going to<br/>&gt;44kHz stereo WAV files. The synth output goes direct to disk and<br/>&gt;bypasses the sound card entirely, so it&apos;s very nice.</p><p>So if you host Rhino in VAZ modular, there does seem to be a<br/>way to get it to render midi files.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>kalamataguy &#x3C;kalamataguy@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2003 2:06:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, Carl!</p><p>Thanks for replying.</p><p>I may be able to do this using Midi Ox and Midi yoke.

Don&apos;t know about Sound Quest MIDI Tools.</p><p>Maybe Cubase will load VST synths from the command line?  And maybe<br/>Rhino will load tunings from the command line?  Then you could do it<br/>with a batch file.</p><p>Maybe Cubase Rhino can remember its settings, even across multiple<br/>instances, I don&apos;t know.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Because I want to have many octaves in the 49 key range I will<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;limit my octaves from a low 5 keys to a high 10 Keys per octave.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Weird?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Can&apos;t say I follow this.

Well, you could do this with the same tuning maps that get your<br/>keys all going in the same direction.
