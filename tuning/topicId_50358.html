Every<br/>unique contribution is a good thing.  15-edo probably won&apos;t be of particular<br/>importance to me, but the ideas that spread into the community by<br/>combination of everyone&apos;s contributions will end up helping me some day,<br/>since notation *will* become a real issue for me sooner or later.  (Sooner,<br/>I hope.)</p><p>-Kurt</p><p> Stephen Szpak writes:</p><p>  I can barely read a melody line in 12 EDO, but I&apos;m not a professional musican and<br/>  never will be. Perhaps notaion is not taken seriously because we (that is I) have such<br/>  a hard time reading music. My old music teacher (God rest her soul) could read and play<br/>  one of Bach&apos;s 2 or 3 part Inventions on the spot.</p><p>Stephen</p><p>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Make your home warm and cozy this winter with tips from MSN House &amp; Home.  <a href="http://special.msn.com/home/warmhome.armx">http://special.msn.com/home/warmhome.armx</a></p></div>
