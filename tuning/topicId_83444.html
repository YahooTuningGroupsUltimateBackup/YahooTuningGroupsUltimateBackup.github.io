When I took that as a single 4:5:6:7:9 chord and I started<br/>      subtracting one-step intervals again and again, after a while, I found two<br/>      small intervals which I could temper out. So the four intervals used were<br/>      1296/1225, 25/24, 3136/3125, and 420175/419904. This means that one mapping<br/>      for the 3/2 was &quot;2 7 2 0&quot; and another was &quot;5 3 0 2&quot;. When I subtracted these<br/>      to get the 1/1, I got a mapping of &quot;3 -4 -2 2&quot;. And when I then subtracted<br/>      multiples of the fifth&apos;s mappings to get the required amounts of tempering<br/>      for the large and small intervals, I got &quot;29 0 -6 14&quot; and &quot;0 29 10 -4&quot;. So<br/>      it turns out that&apos;s actually 29 equal steps to a fifth, where the large<br/>      interval has a size of 4 steps and the small interval size is 3 steps. I<br/>      don&apos;t have a chance to try it out but it seems it must work pretty well<br/>      because the two commas I tempered out are really small ... Anyone who has<br/>      something to say about 29-ED3/2? :-D</p><p>      Petr</p><p>      ------------------------------------</p><p>      You can configure your subscription by sending an empty email to one<br/>      of these addresses (from the address at which you receive the list):<br/>        <a href="mailto:tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - join the tuning group.<br/>        <a href="mailto:tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">tuning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> - leave the group.<br/>        tuning-nomail@yahoogroups..com - turn off mail from the group.<br/>        <a href="mailto:tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com">tuning-digest@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send daily digests.<br/>        <a href="mailto:tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com">tuning-normal@yahoogroups.com</a> - set group to send individual emails.<br/>        <a href="mailto:tuning-help@yahoogroups.com">tuning-help@yahoogroups.com</a> - receive general help information.<br/>      Yahoo!
