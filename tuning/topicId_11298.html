I am reposting because of a guess that a special character I<br/>quoted in my first post, which appeared as an &quot;o-acute&quot; on my display but<br/>is apparently a &quot;cents&quot; symbol in some other character set scheme, may<br/>have caused a reported problem in nondigest mode in which my text was<br/>treated as an attachment in a nonstandard character set. Here I am<br/>replying to a response by Paul Erlich in TD 719.]</p><p>Hello, there, Paul, and thank you very much for some very interesting<br/>and stimulating comments, as well as your correction of my<br/>misassociation of 7-tet with Javanese/Balinese pelog (of which more in<br/>another reply I&apos;m posting along with this).</p><p>&gt; Since you&apos;re willing, under special circumstances, to extend the<br/>&gt; hypermeantone range to include 27-tET, with its fifths ~9.15 cents wider<br/>&gt; than pure, might you also be willing to extend the &quot;stylistic<br/>&gt; meantone&quot; range to include, under special circumstances, 26-tET with<br/>&gt; fifths ~9.65 cents flatter than pure? As Dave Keenan and I have<br/>&gt; discussed, you can get very interesting effects from such a tuning,<br/>&gt; which I&apos;ve been able to experiment with to a limited extent on my<br/>&gt; keyboard.</p><p>This is a very interesting question, and before suggesting two<br/>possible ways of extending the definition of meantone in this fashion,<br/>I would emphasize that definitions of the kind we are discussing and<br/>refining -- and especially ones that I must take responsibility for<br/>offering -- should never stand in the way of making good music.</p><p>While 26-tet is clearly outside the range of _historical_ European<br/>meantone (19-tet or ~1/3-comma being the narrowest regular fifth of<br/>which I&apos;m aware in this tradition), this doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that<br/>our &quot;meantone&quot; range couldn&apos;t be broadened to include it. Especially<br/>if 26-tet proves an attractive tuning for some compositions with a<br/>&quot;meantone-like&quot; tertian style -- maybe a &quot;neo-Renaissance&quot; or<br/>&quot;neo-Baroque&quot; outlook, as it were (compare neo-Gothic), or also a<br/>&quot;neo-Classic&quot; or &quot;neo-Romantic&quot; outlook -- then we might have a very<br/>strong musical motivation for doing so.</p><p>Dave Keenan has proposed one definition of meantone which would<br/>include 26-tet: a tuning where the regular major third is the best<br/>approximation of 5:4. This gives us a meantone range of tunings with<br/>fifths from ~691.50 cents to 700 cents.[1]</p><p>While, as mentioned in a footnote in my paper citing our e-mail<br/>correspondence, we might take it as a _necessary_ condition that any<br/>meantone have a regular major second with a ratio between 9:8 and<br/>10:9, suppose we also take this as a _sufficient_ condition. Then our<br/>lower limit for meantone would be the point where the diatonic major<br/>second is 10:9 (~182.40 cents), and thus the fifth at ~691.20 cents<br/>(~11.75 cents, or precisely 1/2 syntonic comma). This is the point<br/>where our regular major third will be exactly one syntonic comma<br/>narrower than pure (100:81).</p><p>Musically, I guess that calling 26-tet a meantone rather than a<br/>hypomeantone would emphasize its utility for at least some<br/>&quot;meantone-like&quot; styles. Calling it a hypomeantone might emphasize that<br/>it is outside the usual range of historical meantones.</p><p>You raise a very interesting parallel with 27-tet -- and a kind of<br/>apparent paradox, if one chooses to accept 27-tet as a neo-Gothic<br/>variety of hypermeantone while not extending the range of &quot;stylistic<br/>meantones&quot; to include 26-tet.</p><p>One fine point: while &quot;hypermeantone&quot; itself, as defined in my paper,<br/>extends all the way out to 5-tet, my inclusion of 27-tet also as a<br/>&quot;_neo-Gothic_ hypermeantone&quot; under certain special circumstances<br/>despite its tempering of the fifth by ~9.15 cents indeed raises<br/>exactly the question you have presented.</p><p>In other words, if 27-tet can be stylistically acceptable under<br/>certain circumstances for Gothic or neo-Gothic music, despite the<br/>prime concords in this style being tempered by 9.15 cents, might not<br/>26-tet likewise be recognized as an acceptable &quot;stylistic meantone&quot;<br/>under certain circumstances also.</p><p>If a rough symmetry between meantone and neo-Gothic hypermeantone<br/>seems to make sense, then one solution might be to recognize a<br/>&quot;peripheral meantone&quot; zone roughly from 26-tet to 19-tet, say,<br/>analogous to a &quot;peripheral neo-Gothic hypermeantone&quot; zone from 22-tet<br/>to 27-tet, say.</p><p>In effect, this scheme would say, &quot;Usual meantones are tempered up to<br/>a bit more than 7 cents in the narrow direction (19-tet), and usual<br/>neo-Gothic hypermeantones up to about the same amount in the wide<br/>direction (22-tet). However, under some conditions meantones can have<br/>fifths narrowed by up to ~9.65 cents (26-tet), and neo-Gothic<br/>hypermeantones can have fifths widened by up to ~9.15 cents (27-tet).&quot;</p><p>A graphical representation of such a proposal, with dotted regions<br/>showing the peripheral zones from 26-tet to 19-tet, and from 22-tet to<br/>27-tet:</p><p>~-16.25       ~-9.65  ~-7.22         0        ~+7.14  ~+9.15     ~18.04<br/>~685.71      ~692.31 ~694.74      ~701.96    ~709.09 ~711.11     720<br/>   |------------|------|-------------|----------|------|-----------|<br/> 7-tet       26-tet 19-tet         Pyth       22-tet 27-tet      5-tet<br/>   |------------|......--------------|-----------------------------|<br/>    hypomeantone     meantone                 hypermeantone<br/>                                     |-----------.......<br/>                                       neo-Gothic range</p><p>Your remarks open various kinds of questions to what may be quite a<br/>running dialogue. For example, while meantone has a lot of historical<br/>associations (however definitionally relevant), &quot;hypermeantone&quot; and<br/>&quot;neo-Gothic&quot; may be pretty much new concepts. How might this affect<br/>definitional symmetry or asymmetry for the &quot;stylistic meantone&quot; and<br/>&quot;neo-Gothic&quot; categories?</p><p>Also, is there is a parallel between the syntonic comma in the<br/>meantone realm and the septimal comma in the outer portion of the<br/>neo-Gothic hypermeantone range? A necessary condition that meantones<br/>have regular major seconds between 9:8 and 10:9, and neo-Gothic<br/>hypermeantones between 9:8 and 8:7 -- rather noncontroversial, it<br/>seems to me, at least as a _necessary_ condition -- maybe suggests<br/>this parallel.</p><p>If we say that stylistic meantones typically temper the fifth up to<br/>1/3-(syntonic)-comma, and neo-Gothic hypermeantones up to<br/>1/4-septimal-comma, but that in special circumstances we can go up to<br/>around 1/2-(syntonic)-comma or 1/3-septimal-comma, this might be<br/>stylistically apt while also approaching absolute symmetry as to the<br/>amount of tempering of the fifth involved in either direction.</p><p>&gt; Certainly in the case of 9:12:16, I would say that, for most<br/>&gt; musically useful timbres and registers, the 16:9 minor seventh is<br/>&gt; already too complex a ratio to be perceptibly worsened by<br/>&gt; mistuning. Instead, bringing it any distance (in this case, halfway)<br/>&gt; towards 7:4 only improves its concordance.  Meanwhile, the two<br/>&gt; perfect fourths are only tempered by 1/4 of a septimal comma. As a<br/>&gt; result, this two-stacked-fourths chord (and for similar reasons,<br/>&gt; chords of three stacked fourths) sounds very pleasant in &quot;pure 9:7<br/>&gt; hypermeantone tuning&quot;, or the virtually identical 22-tET.</p><p>This is another good question: does the pleasant effect of 9:12:16 in<br/>Pythagorean derive in part from the pure 16:9 minor seventh, or simply<br/>from the two pure fourths? How about the role of the 9:8 in 4:6:9?<br/>Do stylistic expectations or settings influence these questions?</p><p>In a 7-limit setting with stable tetrads, sonorities built from three<br/>stacked fourths in 22-tet would (as you point out in your article<br/>also) have a special appeal because of the near-pure 7:6 (or its<br/>octave) as the outer interval of D3-G3-C4-F4, or example.</p><p>In a complex 3-limit setting, I wonder how this would compare with the<br/>Pythagorean 27:36:48:64, which I have found quite pleasant. If<br/>Japanese gagaku uses basically pure fifths for its vertical<br/>sonorities, then such sonorities would occur quite often.</p><p>Anyway, thank you for raising some questions inviting a lot more<br/>dialogue.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p><p>----<br/>Note<br/>----</p><p>1. Note also Keenan&apos;s ingenious definition of a Wolf fifth less<br/>accurate as an approximation of 3:2 than some other interval produced<br/>by a reasonably short chain of such fifths. This gives a range of<br/>&quot;non-Wolf&quot; fifths from around 12.7 cents narrow to 12.9 cents wide,<br/>not too far from one traditional limit of 1/2 Pythagorean comma or<br/>~11.73 cents in either direction.</p></div>
