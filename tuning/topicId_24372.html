The small steps of Blackjack become more &quot;melodic&quot; as you<br/>move towards 31-equal.

Guitars being guitars, this<br/>often means some added notes creep in to the 11-limit chord.  But<br/>different things are likely to sound good with a more accurate fretting,<br/>so perhaps you should get one of those together.  Perhaps we&apos;ll need to<br/>optimise for particular inversions.</p><p>Another aim is to keep the strings roughly evenly spread in pitch.  No<br/>pairs in my tuning should be closer than a neutral third, or further apart<br/>than a tritone.</p><p>&gt; &gt; So, with whatever criteria, we have a big list of tunings.

Exactly<br/>where depends on whether you prefer 5:4 to 9:7.  This should work with<br/>different open-string tunings, including some that aren&apos;t miracle based.</p><p>&gt; The optimum choice for this depends _totally_ on what the open string<br/>&gt; tuning is. If a bunch of likely-looking open string tunings all had<br/>&gt; the same optimum rotation, that would be good enough.</p><p>How would you define this optimum rotation?  Surely it&apos;d depend on how you<br/>wanted the &quot;home key&quot; to relate to the open strings.</p><p>&gt; There is another useful stopping point on the Miracle chain between<br/>&gt; Blackjack and Canasta.

A blackjack fretting would work specifically for 11-limit<br/>miracle-based music, and will also have frets in common with meantone.  If<br/>you have more than 21 frets, they&apos;ll get in the way, so you may as well<br/>round up to 31, and then make them equal.</p><p>&gt; But I&apos;d be happy if these scales could only be played in one position<br/>&gt; far down the neck, making use of &quot;parasitic&quot; notes caused by the<br/>&gt; continuous frets.

Supplying an external drone<br/>would be easier than building it into the guitar.</p><p>            Graham</p></div><h3><a id=24410 href="#24410">ðŸ”—</a>graham@microtonal.co.uk</h3><span>6/6/2001 4:06:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;<a href="mailto:memo.259702@cix.compulink.co.uk">memo.259702@cix.compulink.co.uk</a>&gt;<br/>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; I think all these scales would sound better with 31 equal frets to the<br/>&gt; octave.</p><p>To pre-empt the corrections on this, the bagpipe scale probably wouldn&apos;t.<br/>I haven&apos;t looked at it.
