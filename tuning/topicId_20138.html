In the beginning, I used E, later A.<br/>Blurry Day uses A.</p><p>&gt; How would I do this, say for example, on your &quot;Blurry Day&quot; tuning<br/>&gt; (which BTW, I&apos;ve been playing quite often these past few weeks - it&apos;s<br/>&gt; wonderful)?  That guitar is gonna get a workout now.</p><p>Thanks! Blurry Day is 17 limit and I&apos;m not sure I could<br/>tune a string by a harmonic that high. The third is a neutral<br/>third, 21/17 and the M7th is a 32/17. One could always<br/>tune with the aid of an electronic tuner. I use a Korg MT1200,<br/>costs about $300 or less, a fine investment.  Now that you<br/>mention it, I should tune this scale up on an acoustic guitar.<br/>It should be a nice piece based on the response I&apos;ve<br/>gotten to Blurry Day.</p><p>The 17th harmonic is very close to 12 tone-evil-temperament<br/>at 104.99 cents - five cents off, but some of the intervals<br/>are close to 24tet and 36tet.</p><p>My suggestion was really to use harmonics on a guitar string<br/>as a place to start. Indians use a tamboura because it contains<br/>all the notes in their tuning system. Before I got La Monte&apos;s<br/>tamboura cd, I was really struggling, (well, I&apos;m still struggling<br/>but the cd made it easier). Didn&apos;t Coalescence have a tamboura<br/>on some of the cuts? I can&apos;t find my copy to check.</p><p>As for Sky (yer CD for those who don&apos;t know), it&apos;s a stunning<br/>follow-up to Coalescence. I&apos;d like to catch some of your shows,<br/>but I&apos;ve been kinda busy and it&apos;s a bit of a drive.

He tries to exactly follow every<br/>note/phrase that his guru sings.  The initial phrases take the<br/>student mainly in the lower octave, but also through middle, to<br/>higher octave.  The student has been taught to &quot;play&quot; the Tanpura<br/>(soft and steady), which has been tuned for him by his guru.  This<br/>exercise is called mandra sadhana (singing in the lower octave).<br/>And, of course, it is &quot;alt.&quot; tuning ALWAYS.  There is no other<br/>accompaniement-- neither Harmonium nor Sarangi, nor anything else.<br/>Each note is stayed on and prolonged.  The guru insists on the<br/>student producing clean, pure, steady and sustained notes.</p><p>Haresh.</p></div><h3><a id=20180 href="#20180">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>3/13/2001 9:55:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., JSZANTO@A... wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20138.html#20176">/tuning/topicId_20138.html#20176</a></p><p>&gt; Well, ahem, gentlemen:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hear!!!!!

Are you<br/>familiar with him, or with the Kirana style of Raga he was renown for?  Pran<br/>Nath was an important influence on microtonal vocalists Terry Riley and<br/>LaMonte Young.</p><p>I had the opportunity to work with him...or more like for him (driving him to<br/>the airport, etc.) while working in 1987 with LaMonte.  And so I had a few<br/>lessons in singing.</p><p>We did the same (don&apos;t worry I won&apos;t say &quot;scale&quot;) raga you described.<br/>However, I was most interested in the gamakas.

The third is a neutral<br/>&gt; third, 21/17 and the M7th is a 32/17. One could always<br/>&gt; tune with the aid of an electronic tuner. I use a Korg MT1200,<br/>&gt; costs about $300 or less, a fine investment.

I don&apos;t even know concretely which tunings I&apos;d like to start<br/>with!  Ah, the guitar is such an old friend.  :)</p><p> Indians use a tamboura because it contains<br/>&gt; all the notes in their tuning system. Before I got La Monte&apos;s<br/>&gt; tamboura cd, I was really struggling, (well, I&apos;m still struggling<br/>&gt; but the cd made it easier). Didn&apos;t Coalescence have a tamboura<br/>&gt; on some of the cuts? I can&apos;t find my copy to check.</p><p>Yes, &quot;Coalescence&quot; has two cuts with a &quot;backpacker&apos;s&quot; tamboura and<br/>the upcoming &quot;Innertones&quot; will have a ~20 min piece with it.  I<br/>actually have an easier time plucking higher harmonics with guitar -<br/>maybe something to do with the tension of strings.  I&apos;ve been<br/>experimenting with tunings on tamboura and getting all kinds of<br/>swirly harmonic fields/drones that I then improvise to/with - this is<br/>how I lull my young daughters to sleep - these are some of the most<br/>precious times of inspiration, creativity, etc. too.</p><p>Thank you once again David for your suggestions and to y&apos;all for the<br/>kindness.</p><p>This list is an inspiring place and I wish I had more<br/>time/focus/knowledge to contribute more to the many excellent<br/>threads.</p><p>~Jim Cole<br/><a href="http://www.spectralvoices.com">http://www.spectralvoices.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=20205 href="#20205">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/14/2001 8:03:14 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>..........</p><p>Hello Johnny,  I am so glad you had the good fortune to work with<br/>Pandit Pran Nath, and even had a few lessons in singing; you may have<br/>met his illustrious guru Ustad Wahid Khan, the doyen of Kirana<br/>gharana.  The only Kirana singer I have heard personally was Pandit<br/>Yashwantrao Purohit.  He was a master exponent of vilambita khayal<br/>gayaki, but died a tragic death at a very early age.</p><p>Please post your notes on gamaka-s, too.</p><p>Let me tell you how I have treated and categorized gamaka-s.  The<br/>gamaka-s have been dealt with by Sharngadeva in the third chapter<br/>of &apos;sangitaratnakara&apos;, where he gives their characteristics and<br/>categories, in general terms and fifteen specific varieties.<br/>But &apos;sangita-parijata&apos; gives twenty varieties.  I gather that in<br/>Karnatic music we have ten types.  Unfortunately, their typology is<br/>not clearly explained anywhere. We have, by inference, about six to<br/>eight identifiable types.</p><p>Now, the definitions of a gamaka.  In terms of aesthetics, a gamaka<br/>should delight the mind.  It is the shaking of a tone (to the delight<br/>of the listener&apos;s mind.)  In terms of musical theory, a gamaka is a<br/>melodic embellishment, vocal or instrumental.  It is a vibratory<br/>tonal effect. It is a contextual use of a note -- or notes.  In what<br/>context?  In any of the following contexts:-</p><p>(i)   Vibrations of a note initiated on another note, previous or<br/>subsequent.<br/>(ii)  Vibrations of a note arsing out of the shruti-s of the same<br/>note.<br/>(iii) the duration of vibrations<br/>(iv)  the depth of vibrations<br/>(v)   the range of vibrations<br/>(vi)  the targeted effect.</p><p>Some examples of gamaka-s.</p><p>[1]  ahata: Vibrating, but accented on the higher note.<br/>[2]  gumphita: producing humming sound.  (Are you reminded of<br/>bhramari pranayama?)<br/>[3]  tribhinna: Using vibrating notes in three successive octaves.<br/>[4]  mudrita: vibrating, with a closed mouth.<br/>[5]  tiripa: vibrating a single note 4 times (or 8 times) to a beat<br/>of short duration, to produce the effect of playing the &apos;damaru&apos;<br/>(Shiva&apos;s little drum).<br/>[6]  tribhinna: Using vibrating notes in three successive octaves.<br/>etc. etc.</p><p>Conclusion.  It is obvious that all gamaka-s are microtonal<br/>applications.  Their aesthetical implications apart, they are<br/>measurable and reproducible as microtones or microtonal ranges.</p><p>How shall we translate &quot;gamaka&apos;?  A tremolo?

This is a lovely mode too.</p><p>My input: MIDI will not give you correct intervals, obviously.<br/>Bhairava is the name of a thaat , and a raga also.  The thaat and the<br/>raga have the same ascending and descending scales.  Now, there is a<br/>complication.  If you play the thaat Bhairava, it sounds pleasing,<br/>but would not have the aesthetics of the raga Bhairava.  The thaat is<br/>just ascending and descending scales, with no grammar, no syntax, no<br/>aesthetic value, and you cannot perform it on the stage, though you<br/>enjoy playing and combining the notes of the thaat at will,<br/>unregulated.  Let us call such playing &quot;mood music&quot;/&quot;relaxing music&quot;<br/>(which is good, too, and, even here, one can achieve great meditative<br/>depths too).  If you want to play the raga Bhairava, however, you<br/>need to learn its grammar and syntax.</p><p>And there is one more problem: there is another raga, called<br/>Kalingada, which has the same ascending and descending scales as<br/>Bhairava raga.  It is differentiable from the raga Bhairava only by<br/>its vastly different syntax and grammar.  Hence, to sum up, just play<br/>the scale for relaxation and sheer joy-- no rules to follow, using<br/>the intrinsic beauty of the notes of the scale.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m wondering, could one use simple integer ratios for good<br/>&gt; approximations to the true intervals used in the ragas?  I noticed<br/>&gt; that when you listened to my harmonic drones you were easily able<br/>to<br/>&gt; identify the harmonic pitches relative to the Indian solfeggio<br/>&gt; system.

For example,  the ratios for the notes of Bhairava would be<br/>[I believe -- please correct me if I am wrong] :-<br/>C     Db      E      F      G      Ab     B      C&apos;<br/>1/1   16/15   5/4    4/3    3/2    8/5    15/8   2/1<br/>(Why am I stating the obvious? --I am sure you knew this already --<br/>have I missed something here?)</p><p>Also, all -- not only lower -- members of the series give just<br/>intervals for practice as well as performance.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; He tries to exactly follow every<br/>&gt; &gt; note/phrase that his guru sings.

Ornamentation techniques are<br/>taught -- and applied -- only at the improvisation stage.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Haresh,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wish that someday you could put together a CD-Rom, or even just<br/>and<br/>&gt; audio CD, of raga vocal lessons.

I<br/>make audio tapes to their requirement, which they use for practice<br/>while driving.  I do not create CD for them, because, hopefully, they<br/>would outgrow the current level of practice, and need to re-record<br/>the practice for the next higher level.

The thaat and<br/>the<br/>&gt; raga have the same ascending and descending scales.  Now, there is<br/>a<br/>&gt; complication.  If you play the thaat Bhairava, it sounds pleasing,<br/>&gt; but would not have the aesthetics of the raga Bhairava.  The thaat<br/>is<br/>&gt; just ascending and descending scales, with no grammar, no syntax,<br/>no<br/>&gt; aesthetic value, and you cannot perform it on the stage, though you<br/>&gt; enjoy playing and combining the notes of the thaat at will,<br/>&gt; unregulated.  Let us call such playing &quot;mood music&quot;/&quot;relaxing<br/>music&quot;<br/>&gt; (which is good, too, and, even here, one can achieve great<br/>meditative<br/>&gt; depths too).  If you want to play the raga Bhairava, however, you<br/>&gt; need to learn its grammar and syntax.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And there is one more problem: there is another raga, called<br/>&gt; Kalingada, which has the same ascending and descending scales as<br/>&gt; Bhairava raga.  It is differentiable from the raga Bhairava only by<br/>&gt; its vastly different syntax and grammar.  Hence, to sum up, just<br/>play<br/>&gt; the scale for relaxation and sheer joy-- no rules to follow, using<br/>&gt; the intrinsic beauty of the notes of the scale.</p><p>Haresh,</p><p>Thanks for this reply. I would have been using a 5 limit JI scale for<br/>this. And I completely harmonize with what you are saying about the<br/>cultural context - a very important point. I am sensitive to this<br/>fact, and know that I&apos;m only getting a sense of the pitch shape of<br/>the raaga. The cultural context of Indian music, is one of the<br/>reasons I&apos;ve never bought any Indian instruments. I revere the music<br/>so much, and I know that for me to attempt to make Indian sounding<br/>music outside of its cultural context, would likely be a disservice<br/>to the spirit of this music. I try to integrate what I can, without<br/>using the sounds or melodic forms exactly.</p><p>To slightly contradict myself above - I have used tabla on a number<br/>of pieces.</p><p>I do however wish to study raaga singing someday, since I feel it<br/>would be beneficial to my compositional activities. I also believe<br/>that I could allow tanpura, and remain respectable.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m wondering, could one use simple integer ratios for good<br/>&gt; &gt; approximations to the true intervals used in the ragas?  I<br/>noticed<br/>&gt; &gt; that when you listened to my harmonic drones you were easily able<br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; identify the harmonic pitches relative to the Indian solfeggio<br/>&gt; &gt; system. Could we assume that the lower members of the harmonic<br/>&gt; &gt; series, would give us good intervals for raga practice?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My input: The true intervals used in a raga ARE simple integer<br/>&gt; ratios.  For example,  the ratios for the notes of Bhairava would<br/>be<br/>&gt; [I believe -- please correct me if I am wrong] :-<br/>&gt; C     Db      E      F      G      Ab     B      C&apos;<br/>&gt; 1/1   16/15   5/4    4/3    3/2    8/5    15/8   2/1<br/>&gt; (Why am I stating the obvious? --I am sure you knew this already --<br/>&gt; have I missed something here?)</p><p>This mode is familiar, and very like varieties in enjoy improvising<br/>with.</p><p>&gt; &gt; I create CDs for practicing singing away from home - mostly<br/>driving<br/>&gt; &gt; to and from my job. So this kind of thing would be wonderful to<br/>&gt; &gt; have.  Do you know if anyone has ever thought to do this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My input: Most of my students travel many miles and spend a total<br/>of<br/>&gt; more than seventy minutes to attend their music class, every week.<br/>I<br/>&gt; make audio tapes to their requirement, which they use for practice<br/>&gt; while driving.  I do not create CD for them, because, hopefully,<br/>they<br/>&gt; would outgrow the current level of practice, and need to re-record<br/>&gt; the practice for the next higher level. [Of course, if they so<br/>&gt; desire, they can record a new CD, too].<br/>&gt;</p><p>Very interesting to know that others use such training techniques.<br/>I&apos;ve found that the windshield of my car is a wonderful reflective<br/>surface to have for practicing overtone singing.</p><p>Thanks Haresh,</p><p>Jacky Ligon</p></div><h3><a id=20296 href="#20296">ðŸ”—</a>Haresh BAKSHI &#x3C;hareshbakshi@hotmail.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/18/2001 8:31:08 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;Haresh BAKSHI&quot; &lt;hareshbakshi@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., ligonj@n... wrote:</p><p>.............<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for this reply.

Well said Haresh - these ideas are very liberating and an<br/>encouragement towards basic enjoyment and inspiration.  Like Jacky,<br/>I&apos;ve hesitated using my tamboura (for public performance particularly<br/>in my case) sometimes because I didn&apos;t want to invite comparison or<br/>dishonor a huge tradition that I know next to nothing about - didn&apos;t<br/>want to seem to be posturing in front of anybody.   Anyway, playing<br/>and listening to tamboura, playing with different &quot;unorthodox&quot;<br/>tunings with it, and singing whatever comes in the moment has been<br/>and continues to be a vast source of joy, creativity, peace and<br/>inspiration to me...and someday I hope to study raga and reap that<br/>bonus as well!</p><p>(Back to the windshield...Oooooaaaaaaahhh)  :)</p><p>~Jim<br/><a href="http://www.spectralvoices.com">http://www.spectralvoices.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=20490 href="#20490">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>3/28/2001 6:46:16 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_20138.html#20175">/tuning/topicId_20138.html#20175</a></p><p>&gt; Hear!!!!!
