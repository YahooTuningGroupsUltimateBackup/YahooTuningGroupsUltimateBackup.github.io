He was an exponent of strict adherence toward<br/>quarter-tones in music, as he demonstrated in his article &quot;The Basis<br/>of the Quarter-Tone Musical System&quot; for the Russian publication De<br/>Musica. In 1927 he gave the first public demonstration and concert of<br/>quarter-tone music in Moscow. He researched quarter-tone music and<br/>conducted an ensemble for microtonal music until 1932. he also wrote<br/>quarter-tone compositions, some of which used the quarter-tone<br/>harmonium and the Emiriton.&quot;</p><p>So the famous Rimsky-Korsakov worked with quarter tones? Or is this<br/>another Rimsky-Korsakov? If it is the same, i&apos;m surprised i&apos;ve never<br/>heard of it... just another supposedly unimportant fact music<br/>historians are trying to shut down. /&Ouml;</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2003 9:13:22 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mats &Ouml;ljare &lt;oljare@h...&gt;<br/>&lt;oljare@h...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; So the famous Rimsky-Korsakov worked with quarter tones?
