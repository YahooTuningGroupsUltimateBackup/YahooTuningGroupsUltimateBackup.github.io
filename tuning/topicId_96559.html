Recently, I&apos;ve discovered that many people were using the term &quot;linear music&quot; for something completely different. However, from what I could find it seems to me that the usage of the term is not very explicit as some people called it &quot;horizontal music&quot;, which I personally would find much more logical for this, and the thing which I dubbed &quot;linear music&quot; (for my personal use so far) didn&apos;t seem to be discussed anywhere.</p><p>What I used to call &quot;linear music&quot; in 2002 is music based on modes whose transposition is made, in most cases, in a linear way rather than exponential -- i.e. if one voice plays a 5-tone melody using relative frequencies of &quot;18, 16, 15, 13.5, 12&quot; and another voice plays the theme 6 units lower, then its relative frequencies are &quot;12, 10, 9, 7.5, 6&quot; (which means the ratios between the two get successively larger but the differences remain constant). My idea was that you could, if desired, eventually mix more than two voices so that another may play, for example, 3 units lower than the second one, and yet another may play, let&apos;s say, 3 units higher than the first one (should we make the harmonies a bit more &quot;unconventional&quot;) or that sort of stuff. This means that scales may be transposed this way as well, which in turn excludes the option of general periods for scales (like octaves, for example). To a certain extent, this might be accomplished using an algorithm or device capable of linear frequency shifting, as long as the overtones are soft enough or have fast decay. The most &quot;straight-forward&quot; application is probably found in amplitude modulation (i.e. parallel multiplication) if one of the two signals is a periodic sine wave.</p><p>So my questions are two.</p><p>#1. Does anyone of you think the term &quot;linear music&quot; is indeed qualified to mean something else?</p><p>#2. If all the terms like &quot;linear tunings&quot; or &quot;linear scales&quot; are in use for something else, do you think there might be another word which would more or less describe what I was describing here?</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Petr</p></div><h3><a id=96560 href="#96560">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/1/2011 12:37:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Petr Pa&angst;Â™&Atilde;&shy;zek &lt;petrparizek2000@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; #2.

That was many years ago and I don&apos;t remember precisely, but in the demo I heard what I recall was a instrumental polyphony that got inverted, the bass playing the inverted melody in the high register etc. I don&apos;t know what would happen with strong harmonic sounds. I downloaded the french manual of the RTAS version (real time plug-in for ProTools) and it shows several parameters you can play with such as :<br/>gain, mix, smooth, band, scale, interpolation, quality, freq in and freq out (= respective zero positions of transfers) ...<br/>Worse than that, it offers you to draw a vectorial curve of your own that controls the transfers between input frequencies in x and output frequencies in y... Obviously, and as the name &quot;FreqWarp&quot; indicates,  it is not exactly meant for microtonal purposes but rather for sound effects...</p><p>About the &quot;Shift&quot; plug-in, they say &quot;this transforms a harmonic sound into an inharmonic one&quot;...<br/>Some of us could see other applications - but apparently no one tried it on this list.
