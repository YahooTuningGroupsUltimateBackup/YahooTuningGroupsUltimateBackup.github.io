Let me<br/>state one again, I don&apos;t like the 6/5 as a minor, I never use it!</p><p>This sentence caused me a double take.  Sends shock waves to these ears.</p><p>I just finished a piece featuring just this interval as I found it a key<br/>towards exploring the 72ET with these +17&#xFFFD; notes.  My previous<br/>explorations centered on exclusively flat 12ET notes and the -83&#xFFFD; notes<br/>seemed the outer edge of this interpretation of the 72ET universe and<br/>were consequently less utilized.</p><p>Looking at my score right now regarding my use of 11:8, I was wrong.  It<br/>was actually a 13 derived harmony I used to climax a piece for<br/>orchestra.  The piece is in d minor and the P5th enters alone very high,<br/>in the harmonic range, followed by the 13th an octave lower.  After<br/>allowing the ear to acclimate to the 13th, the rest of the tonic chord<br/>follows in force minus the 3rd.  The effect is tense, perhaps, but not<br/>too frightening.</p><p>I&apos;m having trouble documenting my &quot;spiritual&quot; equation with just<br/>intonation.  Suffice it to say, the more just the music, the more higher<br/>harmonics are in the air.  And triggering these &quot;hidden&quot; notes has<br/>seemed to me a worthy goal.</p><p>- * -</p><p>The following is quoted from Arthus H. Thornhill III, Six Circles, One<br/>Dewdrop, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1993</p><p>[p177] . . . Nanko then illustrates the proper attitude [re:<br/>&quot;spirituality&quot; in music] by alluding to two koans in the Pi-yen lu:</p><p>Ho Shan imparted some words saying, &quot;Cultivating study is called<br/>&apos;learning.&apos;  Cutting off study is called &apos;nearness.&apos;  Going beyond these<br/>two is to be considered real going beyond.&quot;<br/> A monk came forward and asked, &quot;What is &apos;real going beyond&apos;?&quot;  Shan<br/>said, &quot;Knowing how to beat the drum.&quot; [Translated by Thomas and J. C.<br/>Cleary, The Blue Cliff Record (Boulder: Shambala, 1977), 2:312]</p><p>Surely, in this context the implication is that true music transcends<br/>the dichotomy of careful study and total spontaneity.  Nanko then<br/>alludes to dance by mentioned Chin Niu, who appears in case 74:</p><p> Every day at mealtime, Master Chin Niu would personally take the rice<br/>pail and do a dance in front of the monks&apos; hall: laughing, out loud he<br/>would say, &quot;Bodhisattvas, come eat!&quot;<br/> Hs&#xFFFD;eh Tou said, &quot;Though he acted like this, Chin Niu was not<br/>good-hearted.&quot;<br/> A monk asked Ch&apos;ang Ch&apos;ing, &quot;When the man of old said, &apos;Bodhisattvas,<br/>come eat!&quot; what was his meaning?&quot;  Chi-ing said, &quot;Much like joyful<br/>praise on the occasion of a meal.&quot; [Ibid., 3:490]</p><p>This incident highlights the tension felt by monks who endeavor to be<br/>free of desire, like pure bodhisattvas, yet at mealtime they cannot<br/>ignore the pangs of appetite.  Chin Niu dances in delight at this<br/>paradox, the inseparability of purity and desire in the human realm.<br/>Nanko&apos;s reference mocks those who suggest that art is devoid of<br/>emotional attachment.<br/> Nanko then remarks that an overtly &quot;spiritual&quot; attitude toward<br/>sarugaku, as exemplified by the rokurin ichiro system, destroys the<br/>vitality of song and dance.  He prefers simply to enjoy Zenchiku&apos;s<br/>performances, rather than daring to augment the erudite comments of<br/>Shigyoku and Kaneyoshi.  Thus the Zen spokesman gets the last word, and<br/>the last laugh, negating Zenchiku&apos;s reified, rigid symbols that destroy<br/>the subtle life of noh, just as cooking ruins the delicate flavor of the<br/>Ai family&apos;s pears.</p><p>RT</p></div><h3><a id=1721 href="#1721">ðŸ”—</a>Dave Keenan &#x3C;d.keenan@xx.xxx.xxx&#x3E;</h3><span>3/15/1999 7:47:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick Tagawa &lt;<a href="mailto:ricktagawa@earthlink.net">ricktagawa@earthlink.net</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;I spoke with Dave Canright over the weekend and he reminds us that 13:8<br/>&gt;is a member of the Fibernacci (sp?) series and may share the<br/>&gt;&quot;uniqueness&quot; found in other intervals of this special class.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Could it&apos;s Fibernacci connection contribute to its added appeal over 11?</p><p>I think the suggestion that Fibonacci ratios (1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 5:3, 8:5,<br/>13:8, 21:13, 34:21, 55:34, ....) or the golden mean (which these approach,<br/>approx 1.618) have anything special going for them with regard to<br/>consonance, is pure numerology.</p><p>The slightly lower dissonance of 13:8 than 11:8 (for harmonic timbres)<br/>despite its slightly higher COMPLEXITY, can be explained by a combination<br/>of TOLERANCE and SPAN.

In other words, the two notes making<br/>up a golden ratio maintain their separate identities better than two<br/>notes at any other interval (assuming harmonic spectra). This might also<br/>be an example of what I just e-mailed you about, the possibility that<br/>the brain could hear two notes and interpret them as separate<br/>fundamentals rather than partials of a single one, which would require a<br/>modification of the whole harmonic entropy formulation. If that happens<br/>at all, it happens at the golden ratio. Note that octave equivalents of<br/>the golden ratio wouldn&apos;t work at all for this! However, as a first<br/>approximation for getting some results out of harmonic entropy I&apos;ll<br/>assume it doesn&apos;t happen at all.</p><p>P.S.
