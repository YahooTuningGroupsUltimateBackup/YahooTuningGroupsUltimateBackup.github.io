I think it&apos;s more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a case of assuming that that&apos;s what I mean because of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; inexplicable drift on this list to place someone in one or the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; other camp.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Alison, I can&apos;t believe you said that. I thought it was only me (and others who&apos;ve exited) that felt this way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is absurd--I&apos;m one of those who works with *both* JI and temperament, both in theory and in practice, and you two seem to think I am a heretic against the One True Religion. Who exactly do you think is working to place people in one camp or the other?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Now, now, Gene. In the name of peace and reconciliation let&apos;s just file this under misunderstanding. I don&apos;t worship JI and certainly don&apos;t accuse you of anything. I just disagree with some of your opinions, as you do mine, but I respect and value your<br/>erudition. No offence or disrespect intended at all. In retrospect I should have posted to the other list where scrutiny is less rigorous.</p><p>To change the subject what are you all listening to currently? Be honest now. Apart from raga and my own music, at the moment I can&apos;t seem to listen to anything other than late medieval and Renaissance choral polyphony, Stravinsky and Arvo Part.</p><p>Kind Regards</p></div><h3>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>6/11/2002 9:15:38 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Alison Monteith &lt;alison.monteith3@w...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; To change the subject what are you all listening to currently?

The singer (Romero) has a quite lovely quality, and her inflections are somewhat outside of 12. Certainly there are tunes that fall into the &apos;regular beat&apos; category, but Greinke is a master at mixing and producing, and I simply love the way this music *sounds*.</p><p>ALSO! I forgot to mention I&apos;ve been enjoying the work of a correspondent from this list and MMM, Mary Beth Ackerly. Her compilation &quot;Intervals of Motion&quot; is very fine, and (as all good music is, to me at least) doesn&apos;t sound like anything else. I got it at CDbaby:</p><p><a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/">http://www.cdbaby.com/</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
