I was thinking about asking Julie a question about the<br/>notation, but I can answer it myself:</p><p>1) Do all the microtonalists associated with these organizations use<br/>the same notation</p><p>Answer:  Yes, as per above.</p><p>2) Given they have used this notation for some time, is it pretty<br/>much standardized and ingrained in practice??</p><p>Answer:  Yes it is, particularly since Joe Maneri has done 20 years<br/>of ear training at New England Conservatory with these symbols.</p><p>3) Is there any chance that Ezra Sims or Joe Maneri would welcome any<br/>suggestions as to &quot;improvements&quot; in the notational symbols they<br/>currently use?</p><p>Answer: Well, we can ask them, but it is highly unlikely, since all<br/>their scores and theory texts are written with these symbols and<br/>these are the ones that are taught...</p><p>(This is, frankly, the kind of question that is so obvious it doesn&apos;t<br/>even have to be asked.)</p><p>Recapitulation:</p><p>This is the kind of question that is so obvious it doesn&apos;t even have<br/>to be asked...</p><p>(I just saved Julie some work...)</p><p>________ ______ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Rick Tagawa &#x3C;ricktagawa@earthlink.net&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2001 12:16:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear Tuning List,<br/>I received Joe&apos;s book &quot;Preliminary Studies in the Virtual Pitch Continuum&quot; and Julia Werntz&apos;s<br/>Dissertation &quot;Toward an Understanding of Expanded Equal Temperaments.&quot;  After just a preliminary<br/>reading of Julie&apos;s Dissertation, it turns out Julie is endorsing an ATONAL approach to using 72.<br/>Basically the idea is that adjacent notes of 72 are barely perceptible and an atonal approach<br/>would better capture the uniqueness of the new intervals.</p><p>She&apos;s reasoning that a tonal approach would &quot;subject the pitches automatically to the overwhelming<br/>gravity of a fundamental tone.&quot;</p><p>I told her that for the same reasons I&apos;ve been thinking the 72 is perfect for written tonal<br/>music.  I think that&apos;s why popular music is so widely accepted.  When you look at the sruti<br/>hovering around concert pitch, by just this barely perceptible amount, I think you can understand<br/>its acceptance in the west.</p><p>Regarding the other thread about piano stretching, I woke up thinking that the plus or minus 5<br/>cents from pure ET that make up the bulk of piano tuning might be the fudge factor that would<br/>allow the 13 limit into the 72 or any limit for that matter, since the maximum error of 72 is<br/>8.33&iuml;&iquest;&half; or half the 1/12 of a tone.  Unfortunately the 13th is flat 8&iuml;&iquest;&half; in 72 thereby doubling the<br/>error in the upper register (if you wanted sharper pitches there.)  I suppose you could restrict<br/>using the 13th in the lower half of the spectrum and undertone 13th in the upper.</p><p>Yours,<br/>Rick</p><p>Paul Erlich wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here is a message from Julie Werntz, co-director of the Boston<br/>&gt; Microtonal Society:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;I&apos;d be happy to answer any<br/>&gt; questions about the Boston 72-note scene. &lt;snip&gt;</p></div><h3>D.Stearns &#x3C;STEARNS@CAPECOD.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>5/24/2001 8:30:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dave Keenan,</p><p>&lt;&lt;Paul, another question for Julie: How do Sims and Maneri _say_ these<br/>accidentals?&gt;&gt;</p><p>Paul Erlich,</p><p>&lt;&lt;That I know.

That&apos;s what I hear most people<br/>saying.</p><p>Also, I asked Julia this question:</p><p>&gt; Joseph Pehrson was asking me how Joe Maneri decided on 72-tET.<br/>Clearly it<br/>&gt; wasn&apos;t from the consonance angle as it was for James Tenney and<br/>myself, or<br/>&gt; from the Partch-performance angle as it was for Ted Mook. Was it<br/>independent<br/>&gt; of contact with Ezra Sims, perhaps born of quarter-tone and sixth-<br/>tone<br/>&gt; interpretations of Middle Eastern musics?<br/>&gt;</p><p>She replied:</p><p>Joe came to microtones well before settling on 72, and several<br/>influences<br/>converge in this. One is, surely, his young adulthood spent<br/>performing Greek<br/>music. This opened up a love for &quot;other&quot; pitches, although he never<br/>applied<br/>this in any literal, ethnomusicological way. Another influence were<br/>his<br/>years developing a highly chromatic compositional style as a student<br/>of the<br/>Second Viennese School. (He studied with Berg&apos;s student Josef Schmidt<br/>for<br/>ten years.) I write about these two influences in my thesis, because<br/>they<br/>are fundamental, and he has them in common with Wyshnegradsky (with<br/>his<br/>&quot;ultrachromaticism&quot;) and Haba, as well.</p><p>Joe began using microtonal inflections in his compositions sometime<br/>in the<br/>1970&apos;s, and these became ever more specific and minute. At some point<br/>after<br/>he met up with Ezra he studied the 72-note chromatic, which seemed<br/>perfect,<br/>even though he was using it for something entirely different. (Joe<br/>wanted<br/>the intervals in his melodies to be smaller and more nuanced, and of<br/>course<br/>to be able to transpose easily. Ezra is still sceptical about using<br/>1/12-tones and 1/6-tones in melodic progressions. See his essay in<br/>the 1991<br/>Perspectives of New Music.) Joe adopted Ezra&apos;s notation, because it<br/>seemed<br/>fine, although it does have problems. He uses it, and I use it,<br/>because<br/>that&apos;s what performers around here know, now, and it&apos;s easy to learn.<br/>But<br/>it&apos;s not too intuitive (e.g. half arrow is a larger interval than<br/>full<br/>arrow, and what the heck is the square root doing there, if you&apos;re<br/>not<br/>thinking about just tuning?). Joe and I are working on a new book,<br/>and we<br/>experimented with a new notation, but it&apos;s too hard to switch after<br/>all<br/>these years, and there is too much else of greater pertinence to<br/>focus on,<br/>as you know, so we gave up that pursuit.</p></div>
