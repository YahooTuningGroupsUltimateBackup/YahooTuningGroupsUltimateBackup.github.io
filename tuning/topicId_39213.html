I&apos;m sure it is ninety percent appearance<br/>and familiarity that&apos;s the issue, and with a few things explained one can<br/>use it as easily as the Windows one - in fact it is<br/>almost identical in the way it functions.</p><p>Here we go:</p><p>&quot;<br/>The SCALA open dialog uses a few conventions from Unix. Since<br/>Unix and Windows have a shared background, actually the same conventions<br/>were common in Windows 3.1 open dialogs too.</p><p>Once you learn these, it is easy to use.</p><p>Look at the layout - it is the same as for the Windows Open dialog.</p><p>At the top you see the folder to look in.<br/>Below that you see a list. This looks unfamiliar because of the squre<br/>brackets - but actually it is just a list of folders and files</p><p>Folders are shown in square brackets, so:</p><p>[scl] means the scl folder</p><p>The rest are all files.</p><p>The files are always shown with the extension such as .scl for scales<br/>- which you can choose to hide in Windows dialogs.</p><p>The puzzling [..] is just a shortcut to take you to the parent folder<br/> - you don&apos;t have this in the Windows Open - but it is convenient<br/>to have.</p><p>So it is just the same layout again as the Windows Open - except that<br/>folders are shown with square brackets instead of folder icons.</p><p>Click on a scale and you will see the name shown below, as with Windows.<br/>You also see the description too, so that&apos;s a bonus!</p><p>Then click OK to open it. That&apos;s it.</p><p>To change to a folder such as the scl folder, double click on it,<br/>again just as in Windows.</p><p>Use the scroll bar to scroll the list - again that is the same as in<br/>Windows. Only thing you don&apos;t have is that you have a single column<br/>list here, while the windows one is multi-column.</p><p>To show all the files beginning with a particular letter, enter<br/>p*.scl in the file name field, and press Ok.</p><p>Again that is just as in Windows.</p><p>To resize the window, hover the mouse over the edge or the lower right<br/>corner, then click and drag, just as for the Windows Open dialog.</p><p>So basically, apart from a few changes in the icons and appearance,<br/>it is a conventional Windows dialog - for most purposes.</p><p>The windows Open dialog does have a fair number of extra features for power users,<br/>such as the option to order files by name, date, size or type etc.<br/>but you probably don&apos;t need them for the uses you make of it in<br/>SCALA, while in the SCALA one you have the new description field for the scale<br/>which you don&apos;t have in the conventional Open dialog.<br/>&quot;</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=39222 href="#39222">ðŸ”—</a>Joseph Pehrson &#x3C;jpehrson@rcn.com&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2002 11:44:37 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_39213.html#39213">/tuning/topicId_39213.html#39213</a></p><p>&gt; HI there,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve done an introduction to the SCALA open dialog for<br/>&gt; Windows users.

The interface really wasn&apos;t working adequately to<br/>bring in the files...  It wouldn&apos;t change directories and stay in one<br/>place.  Otherwise, it is, indeed, very similar to the Windows<br/>interface.</p><p>I just tried it again, though, and I notice that there has been great<br/>improvement.  Manuel says he was working on it, so maybe this is the<br/>result.  I had no trouble loading files in this time.</p><p>So now there are a *couple* of methods!</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>Joseph</p></div>
