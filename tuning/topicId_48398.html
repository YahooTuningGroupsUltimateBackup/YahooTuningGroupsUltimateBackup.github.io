There is no catch - the software versions that we sell are OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) which means you will receive the installation CDs only (they do not come in their original retail packing and do not include the manual). We do guarantee that all programs are the 100&#xF;ull working retail versions - no demos or academic versions! When you order, you will receive all materials required for a complete installation - or your money back! Why pay hundreds dollars more when you can get exactly the same but cheaper? You don&apos;t have to pay that much for the fancy box and manuals.<br/><a href="http://oem-cd.biz/adv3/?oem">http://oem-cd.biz/adv3/?oem</a></p></div>
