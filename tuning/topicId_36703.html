Oh NOO!!!</p><p>It might have actually been more of a pull if you put West 4th Street and<br/>then put Brandenburg Concerto #35.  THAT might have sparked curiosity.</p><p>Just be sure you don&sup1;t slip and put 135 W 41st Street, or people will wind<br/>up at Saci Club.  THAT could be umm ... Interesting.</p><p>Sorry I didn&apos;t catch the typo Johnny, I haven&apos;t been reading the list much.<br/>I just checked to see if you said anything today about the show last night.</p><p>At the very least I don&apos;t feel as bad about you telling the world my Mostly<br/>Electric String Quartet No. 1 was in 34 equal.  Even though I still have to<br/>re explain it to people every time the radio show is replayed, that it was<br/>in 32.  The next time, though, I&apos;ll just smile and remember that church on<br/>35th Street.</p><p>Seriously, though, I was only upset because I couldn&apos;t imagine you<br/>misannouncing something microtonal.</p><p>After all, cumulative error can impress the unstable as intentional if it&apos;s<br/>transitive.  Hence the guy on John Lennon&apos;s lawn saying &quot;you wrote all those<br/>beatle songs about ME right?&quot;</p><p>Marc</p><p>P.S. To anyone else... It was at 135 West 4th Street, as will be two other<br/>AFMM concerts this season.</p></div>
