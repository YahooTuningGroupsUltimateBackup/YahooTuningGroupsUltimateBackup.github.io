Of course, it would not be surprising at all to find they<br/>did. I had a question about Bach myself...I have read, in various<br/>places, that he had an interest in numerology; does anyone know anything<br/>about this? Was there some system he studied? How, if this is so, did it<br/>affect his composition? Any info would be appreciated.<br/>    A superb rendition of the Bach solo sonatas/partitas is by guitarist<br/>Kazuhito Yamashita...he also does the cello sonatas. Not only is the<br/>technique staggering, but the feeling, the emotional depth, is amazing.<br/>He&apos;s really playing on a deep level.<br/>    Speaking of guitarists, I just read a review of a guitarist named<br/>Adam Del Monte, who has a guitar fretted to meantone...has anyone heard<br/>his CD? I think that&apos;s a good thing....Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=27169 href="#27169">ðŸ”—</a>Neil Haverstick &#x3C;STICK@USWEST.NET&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2001 10:57:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Here&apos;s something that occurred to me last nite, while listening to<br/>the Bach unaccompanied sonatas for cello; maybe someone has insight into<br/>this. Would a cellist (or violinist, in the case of the solo violin<br/>sonatas) necessarily try to stay in a well temperament while playing<br/>these pieces? Since there&apos;s no frets, would they possibly alter notes to<br/>be closer to pure tuning when possible? Would such a consideration even<br/>be an issue? Or, did Bach think of these pieces in a well temp, and<br/>would he have wanted a cellist/violinist to adhere to that concept? I<br/>realize that this is sort of a nebulous area, but I really am<br/>curious...Hstick</p></div><h3><a id=27173 href="#27173">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2001 12:16:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot; &lt;STICK@U...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Since there&apos;s no frets, would they possibly alter notes to<br/>&gt; be closer to pure tuning when possible?</p><p>Perhaps -- and a few string players actually do this. John<br/>deLaubenfels&apos; program could emulate such a set of tuning choices.<br/>Most classical string players, however, do the opposite -- they play<br/>sharps _higher_ than the enharmonically equivalent flats.

What do you know, this matches Werckmeister tuning.</p><p>More recently, I asked Dave Eggar to record his favorite movements into a mega-suite of all 6 suites, and to play each in its appropriate Werckmeister placements.  It helps, not hurts.  Pushing to just intonation, when Bach has long been on record as opposing pure thirds, is inappropriate to the composer&apos;s wishes.  (It was Kirnberger who was to confirm that Bach had all major thirds sharp.)</p><p>So, yes, Neil, the destinctive keys of Bach&apos;s baroque apply to his Suites as well (especially as they imply harmony throughout).</p><p>Best, Johnny Reinhard</p></div><h3><a id=27175 href="#27175">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>8/20/2001 2:01:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., Afmmjr@a... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Pushing to just intonation, when Bach has long been on record as<br/>&gt;opposing pure thirds, is inappropriate to the composer&apos;s wishes.</p><p>Bach instructed that keyboards be tuned with wide thirds, so that a<br/>circulating temperament would result. Do we have any evidence that<br/>Bach opposed shading the thirds toward purity on the &apos;cello?<br/>Certainly, he would have opposed shading the thirds _away_ from<br/>purity, which is one of the effects of &quot;expressive intonation&quot; (as<br/>sharps are intoned higher than enharmonically equivalent flats).</p><p>&gt;(It was Kirnberger who was to confirm that Bach had all major thirds<br/>&gt;sharp.)</p><p>On his keyboard, yes.</p></div>
