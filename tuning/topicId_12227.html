Consequently, I would push awareness of<br/>irrationals back at least to the Milesians.</p><p>Specifically, the &apos;Theorem of Thales&apos; states that the angle inscribed within<br/>a semicircle must be a right angle. This construction generates the set of<br/>so-called &apos;Pythagorean triangles&apos; and lays the basis for the geometrical mean<br/>by dropping the perpendicular and hence constructing the irrational division<br/>of a line segment.</p><p>Such pythagorean triangles were also known to be in use by Egyptian<br/>architects (evident in the proportions of temples). This indicates that<br/>irrational numbers preceded Pythagoras&apos; life time.</p><p>Siemen Terpstra</p></div><h3><a id=12236 href="#12236">ðŸ”—</a>Monz &#x3C;MONZ@JUNO.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>9/2/2000 6:30:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Siemen, Joe Monzo here.  Nice to make contact with you.</p><p>Your article in 1/1 led me the writings of Ernest McClain,<br/>which in turn led me into what has so far been a summer-long<br/>&apos;dig&apos; into ancient Babylonian and Sumerian music and culture.</p><p>I&apos;m glad to be able to discuss this with you, but unfortunately<br/>only have a brief second right now; hopefully I can write<br/>more to you later.  As yet, I have nothing on the web about<br/>Sumerian/Babylonian stuff except for a few postings to this List.</p><p>While it&apos;s true that of the Babylonian texts that have so<br/>far been proven to concern music, none say anything about ratios<br/>or numbers, I believe that I may have found another Babylonian<br/>math text that does provide formulae for calculating &apos;Pythagorean&apos;<br/>string-lengths.  I have a hunch that it may alternatively<br/>be a formula for calculating temperament.</p><p>It&apos;s absolutely certain that the Babylonians (and probably<br/>the Sumerians before them) knew how to calculate arbitrarily<br/>close rational (sexagesimal) approximations to the square-root<br/>of 2, so I&apos;m wondering if they might have actually even<br/>discovered how to calculate 12-tET.</p><p>Anyway, that&apos;s just a &apos;teaser&apos;.  When I have more time,<br/>I&apos;ll write more about it to you.</p><p>Stop by and see us in San Diego if you come to California!</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/homepage.html</a></p></div>
