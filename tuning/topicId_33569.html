It seems like utter nonsense to<br/>&gt; suggest that a listener would perceive an isolated dyad exactly as<br/>&gt; 125/64!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now, Monz will argue that in a non-isolated context, with harmonic<br/>&gt; motion, one could perceive 31/16 as 125/64. I&apos;d like him to provide<br/>&gt; an example, and then to offer his own intepretation, from his<br/>&gt; example, as to exactly _whay_ is being perceived as _what_.</p><p>I tend to go with Monz, and I have in mind real life<br/>conditions where ratios aren&apos;t exact and where generating<br/>intervals tend to be used more than once; not too different<br/>from the way intervals work in a carefully figured out<br/>temperament, I think they tend to be taken for the things<br/>they mean, not necessarily for the things they are.</p><p>Comments about the following welcome.

(I<br/>could give higher primes more weight initially by taking<br/>their complement to 1 when their exponents are negative, but<br/>eventually this penalizes longer generator chains.)</p><p>Examples: 5/4 consists of the primes 2, 2, and 5. The second<br/>2 is taken to the power of 0, and I add 5+2+1, 8. 25/24<br/>consists of the prime 5 twice (-&gt; 5+1), 3 once, and 2 three<br/>times (-&gt; 2+1+0.5). The plausibility value is 5+3+3.5, 11.5.<br/>125/64 consists of 5 three times (-&gt; 5+1+0.2) and 2 six<br/>times (-&gt; 2+1+0.5+0.25+0.125+0.0625) and is thus 10.1375.</p><p>31/16 already has prime 31. With the reduced factors of 2<br/>added, this is 34.875. Very different.</p><p>What to make of it? I&apos;m supposing two things: a) listeners<br/>don&apos;t readily jump to interpretations implying a much higher<br/>value, and b) ratios with higher values need to be tuned<br/>much more accurately.</p><p>So if a piece of music (or a collection of pitches :) ) uses<br/>an interval of around 1160c &quot;understandably&quot; as 125/64<br/>(1159c), and there is another one 10-15c smaller , this will<br/>more likely be heard as 35/18 (1151c) than as a 31/16<br/>(1145c), unless the context consists of the harmonic series<br/>exclusively. 125/64 has a (well, really negative)<br/>plausibility of 10.1375; 35/18 has 18; 31/16 34.975.<br/>On the other hand, if you use an interval like 31/16<br/>melodically (freely, i.e. outside of the harmonic series,<br/>which is a special, primarily harmonic context this<br/>plausibility doesn&apos;t account for), you&apos;d be advised to use<br/>e.g. 45/23 (1162c) as a higher variation of this pitch,<br/>because it has an equally high plausibility value of 32. A<br/>dip to the lower values of 3-limit intervals might spoil<br/>this high-prime intervals for you.</p><p>While I have a hunch this supposed principle is at work in<br/>Jackie Ligon&apos;s unabashed no-limit music, my own experience<br/>stays firmly within 5-limit: 5/4 and 81/64 outside their<br/>context make a huge difference for me, whereas I don&apos;t care<br/>much about jumps of one minor 6th or the other. 5/4 and<br/>81/64 have 8 and 8.3819444.., respectively; 8/5 and 128/81<br/>have 8.5 and 8.41319444...</p><p>klaus schmirler</p></div><h3><a id=33575 href="#33575">ðŸ”—</a>paulerlich &#x3C;paul@stretch-music.com&#x3E;</h3><span>2/2/2002 12:02:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., klaus schmirler &lt;KSchmir@z...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; paulerlich schrieb:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In a context where these two ratios would be audibly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; indistinguishable, a listener will probably perceive<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 31/16 *as* 125/64, because of the lower prime-factors.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I find this absurd.

I thought we were<br/>talking about the _intervals_ 31:16 and 125:64, since Monz invoked<br/>harmonic entropy to justify his point of view, and harmonic entropy<br/>concerns _intervals_, not _pitches_.</p><p>&gt; Comments about the following welcome.

Then, based on<br/>some picture of what the music might be like, you _combine_ the types<br/>of reckoning in (1) and (2).</p><p>What I thought Monz was talking about, since he invoked harmonic<br/>entropy, was strictly the first part. This part alone merits serious<br/>study, because if you don&apos;t get part (1) right, how can you combine<br/>it with your model of (2) afterwards?</p><p>&gt; So if a piece of music (or a collection of pitches :) )  uses<br/>&gt; an interval of around 1160c &quot;understandably&quot; as 125/64<br/>&gt; (1159c),</p><p>So you mean a _pitch_ labeled 125/64, then?</p><p>&gt; and there is another one 10-15c smaller , this will<br/>&gt; more likely be heard as 35/18 (1151c) than as a 31/16<br/>&gt; (1145c), unless the context consists of the harmonic series<br/>&gt; exclusively.</p><p>OK . . . but you pretty much have to assume a context that includes<br/>5/4 and 25/16 for 125/64 to be &quot;understandable&quot; in the first place,<br/>don&apos;t you?</p><p>&gt; 125/64 has a (well, really negative)<br/>&gt; plausibility of 10.1375; 35/18 has 18; 31/16 34.975.<br/>&gt; On the other hand, if you use an interval like 31/16<br/>&gt; melodically (freely, i.e. outside of the harmonic series,<br/>&gt; which is a special, primarily harmonic context this<br/>&gt; plausibility doesn&apos;t account for), you&apos;d be advised to use<br/>&gt; e.g. 45/23 (1162c) as a higher variation of this pitch,<br/>&gt; because it has an equally high plausibility value of 32.</p><p>I&apos;m not following . . . I thought you said plausibility doesn&apos;t<br/>account for such a case, and yet you proceed to use it . . . I&apos;m<br/>confused. Can you help me understand you better?</p></div>
