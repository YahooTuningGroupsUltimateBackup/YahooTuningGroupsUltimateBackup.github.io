Hitting the same<br/>pitch in that sort of linguistic context, I betcha, has to do with trained<br/>muscular memory in setting up the vocal chords. There are a lot of easier<br/>ways to unearth pitch recognition, aren&apos;t there? I don&apos;t doubt that being<br/>raised in a culture with a tonal language could encourage one&apos;s<br/>pitch-recognition potential.<br/>Here&apos;s a ponderable, just what, not why. I am blessed with &quot;pitch<br/>recognition&quot; (I prefer to call it that). When I&apos;m singing in a casual<br/>manner, either to myself or to someone &quot;in passing&quot;, I sing a given song in<br/>whatever key happens to feel kumfy at the moment and intonation be slightly<br/>damned. I often hear myself singing in a key somewhere between two<br/>&quot;standard&quot; pitches, but feel no compunction to change it. I guess I mention<br/>that to indicate that a sense of pitch may have little to do with the way<br/>one chooses to use the voice.<br/>  At 02:16 PM 11/5/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>&gt;From: &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jadl@idcomm.com">jadl@idcomm.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Friday&apos;s newspaper had an article originally written by James Glanz<br/>&gt;of the New York Times, citing a paper submitted to a meeting of the<br/>&gt;Acoustical Society of America, by Diana Deutsch of UC San Diego.

Burge sells a taped course on perfect pitch. His number is (515)<br/>472-3100. I don&apos;t remember why, but several years ago I bought the course<br/>for $99 or so. I listened to one tape at most. I think that I might still<br/>be eligible for a refund. I hope so.</p><p>Frankly, I find the concept of perfect pitch ludicrous. I want to work with<br/>musicians who listen to what is happening and can relate to that, not to<br/>their memory of some instrument that is not being played. So perfect pitch<br/>is a skill that I would not care to develop. If any singer auditioning for<br/>me claimed perfect pitch as one of his skills, I&apos;d listen extra carefully<br/>to how he sang in an ensemble. Would he sing the so-called correct pitches<br/>if the rest of the ensemble drifted, or would he go with the ensemble? When<br/>singing F in a Dmin7 chord and then in a G7 chord would he sing the same<br/>pitch both times, or would he adjust according to harmonic context? I want<br/>singers who do the latter in both cases, and I suspect that anyone claiming<br/>perfect pitch might do the former.</p><p>On the other hand, when I&apos;ve been intensely working on something I&apos;m<br/>singing, I can often find the starting note very accurately without first<br/>hearing any reference pitch. More than once I have done this upon awakening<br/>after a full night&apos;s sleep. I suspect that most people could do the same if<br/>they worked at it. But so what? It is much more musically interesting for<br/>an ensemble to learn how to sing a C7 b5 b9 b13 chord in tune. Perfect<br/>pitch won&apos;t help with that.</p><p>John Link<br/>ALMOST ACAPPELLA</p><p>&gt;From: &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jadl@idcomm.com">jadl@idcomm.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Friday&apos;s newspaper had an article originally written by James Glanz<br/>&gt;of the New York Times, citing a paper submitted to a meeting of the<br/>&gt;Acoustical Society of America, by Diana Deutsch of UC San Diego.

The Chinese tonal languages are not precise pitches and so<br/>there may not be that much of a basis with Perfect Pitch.  They are<br/>vocalizing within a bandwidth which does not sit right with the Perfect Pitch<br/>digital capture of a pitch.  There are likely other pitch memory strategies<br/>involved.

A certain willful adjustment is necessary on the part of<br/>anyone with a talent if functionality is desired. When I was young, after<br/>being made aware of my ability in relation to a specific set of parameters,<br/>namely, our standard pitch system, I was somewhat hobbled by it. But then I<br/>discovered electronic music a la Stockhausen, Xenakis, et al, different<br/>temperaments, and all sorts of other sound worlds. I also grew up hearing<br/>music from other cultures, so it wasn&apos;t so hard to erase most prejudices. I<br/>find this ability now, to be an absolute blessing because it is not just a<br/>talent for remembering pitches, it is a talent for remembering sounds<br/>accurately. Being a blind musician, it compensates greatly for not being<br/>able to look at all the scores I&apos;d so much like to.
