<a href="/tuning">back to list</a><h1>AW.: missed by the unimaginative (Ives on tuning)</h1><h3>DWolf77309@cs.com</h3><span>10/19/1999 2:18:11 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks for posting the _Memos_ text. I haven&apos;t been able to find my own copy.</p><p>Ives makes three propositions here that contradict one another in such a way<br/>that I would hesitate to make any final claim for his intonation.  First, he<br/>states that the &quot;ear-mind&quot; will make intonational distinctions between tones<br/>that are physically the same. This is entirely in keeping with the<br/>transcendental ideal (the last paragraph cited sure sounds like an<br/>Emersonian!), and implies that a 12tet instrumentarium is perfectly<br/>sufficient for the performance of his music (the quartertone pieces excepted,<br/>of course).  Second, he makes a claim for a raised leading tone in sung<br/>ascending melodies and a lowered leading tone in descending melodies, in<br/>spite of the piano&apos;s pitch. This suggests a mixed pythagorean and just<br/>intonation. Finally, in his description of his experiments with string<br/>ensemble, he indicates that a db should be lower than a c# . This suggests<br/>pythagorean.</p><p>(When Lou Harrison was asked to make an edition of the _Universe Symphony_,<br/>he came to the conclusion that Ives&apos; ideas about tuning were visionary but<br/>(Austin and Reinhard to the contrary) incomplete. One has the impression that<br/>Ives&apos; grasp of tuning theory was casual, leading to vaguenesses and<br/>contradictions that are impossible to resolve.  Given that an &quot;impossible<br/>resolution&quot; is entirely within the Ivesian spirit, isn&apos;t it appropriate to<br/>try as many possibilities as one can, understanding that no solution will be<br/>definitive? For myself, I&apos;d love to hear _the Unaswered Question&quot; with the<br/>strings in triadic JI, the woodwinds in pythagorean or 12tet and the solo<br/>trumpet in the free style. This is not a solution grounded in any theoretical<br/>text by Ives but rather one that I find would well project certain aspects of<br/>the musical text.)</p></div>
