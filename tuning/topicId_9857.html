Southeast asia is a good example. A person growing up in the environment of a particular culture is the same as &quot;extensive training&quot;. It is impossible to guess what someone is singing by &quot;reason&quot;. By the way Doug Leedy I understand sings 12/11 and 13/12 unaccompanied.</p><p>Polychroni wrote:</p><p>&gt; On 2 May 01, at &quot;Paul Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM">PERLICH@ACADIAN-ASSET.COM</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;Recall, that our chanter, if chanting without the instrumental<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;accompaniment could not sing Al Sibn&apos;s intervals to begin with--being<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;unable to accurately judge the size of the 88/81 step. He might sing,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;instead, 9/8, 12/11, 13/12 (cumm=9/8, 27/22, 117/88 = 204c, 355c,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;493c). This would be heard by him and his audience as 9/8, 11/9, 4/3).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So this too, is equivalent.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Unless he underwent extensive training with an instrument, I doubt<br/>&gt; &gt; our chanter could or would accurately produce 12/11 or 13/12 steps<br/>&gt; &gt; unaccompanied.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Does this not convey the idea that in vocal progession up the diatonic scale, the vocalist could only sing the tetrachordal intervals of Ptolemaic syntonon 9/8, 10/9, 16/15? What about the distance from 316c to 386c for the 3rd, is it then unreasonable for the chanter to find a &apos;space&apos; to hit somewhere in here? Otherwise, this would imply that *all* vocal diatonic music is confined to this intonation of the tetrachord. If one listens to Middle Eastern chant, it&apos;s simply not so.
