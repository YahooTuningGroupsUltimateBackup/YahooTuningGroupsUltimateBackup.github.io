First place<br/>I hit was being influenced partially by a tritone interval, which is<br/>weak but not negligible in the e3 tunings (es3, er3, evv3, etc.).</p><p>Paul has long been asking me to run the &quot;no tuning file&quot; option with no<br/>vertical springs at all except across the obviously consonant intervals<br/>(3, 4, and 5 semitones, plus inversions).  So I finally did that!  I<br/>had confidently predicted the program would do just fine, but must admit<br/>I experienced slightly sweaty palms as I launched it off: zeros have a<br/>funny way of ending up in the denominator of a division.  Ran fine,<br/>though, and I&apos;m uploading the results for the Bach and Mozart.</p><p>The sound?  Not sure it&apos;s better than the other, but it&apos;s more true to<br/>Paul&apos;s request.</p><p>If anybody wants to download the earlier versions, please do so in the<br/>next day or so, so I can free up the space.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
