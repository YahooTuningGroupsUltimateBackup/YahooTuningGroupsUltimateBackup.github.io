Those are both fifths. I&apos;m referring to the inversion of the<br/>fifth, which is the fourth, and which has a different melodic span in<br/>terms of pitch difference.</p><p>This is much more relevant to the issue of octave displacement of<br/>selected notes in a melody. In that case, both the DIRECTION of<br/>motion is reversed, and the SPAN (PITCH DISTANCE) of the interval is<br/>changed. The further removed from a tritone the interval to be<br/>inverted is, the greater the change in pitch distance.</p><p>I&apos;m simply saying that Frere Jacque on C, for example, based on a<br/>motive with a pitch sequence of CDEC in the same octave, is a<br/>sequence of two upward stepwise motions and then a drop to the<br/>orginal pitch a third below. That is how we hear melody: by melodic<br/>contour!</p><p>If you transpose the initial C up an octave, you get an initial<br/>DOWNWARD motion of a seventh before proceeding to the E which, if we<br/>transpose it down an octave, entails another DOWNWARD motion of a<br/>seventh before returning to the untransposed final C a minor sixth<br/>ABOVE it. The melodic contour has been RADICALLY ALTERED by the<br/>octave transposition of two notes. This is why such a melody sounds<br/>so entirely different. We&apos;ve radically changed the melodic CONTOUR in<br/>terms of both directin of melodic movement and the DISTANCE of that<br/>motion.</p><p>On the &quot;expectation&quot; issue, if you take an unfamiliar melody and<br/>repeat it in its entirety with a whole octave displacement for every<br/>note without advising anyone that this is what you&apos;re going to do,<br/>anyone with the slightest quantum of musical perception will identify<br/>it as the same melody even if they don&apos;t know what an octave is.</p><p>They may do the same thing for the same melody tranposed a fifth up<br/>or down, or any other interval, but it won&apos;t sound as if it were in<br/>the same key. I don&apos;t understand how anyone can seriously argue<br/>against the concept of octave equivalence. I&apos;ve never seen any<br/>evidence of its being a culturally conditioned phenomenon. It seems<br/>to be quite universal that men and women sing the same melody an<br/>octave apart and perceive each other as singing the same melody.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;unidala&quot; &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;BobWendell@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, I&apos;ve been hanging out on this one waiting to see who else<br/>&gt;would<br/>&gt; &gt; say it first.

To me, 8ve-equivalence or<br/>&gt; similarity<br/>&gt; &gt; is simply a result of the acoustical properties of prime-factor 2.<br/>&gt; &gt; It&apos;s not essentially different in kind, but only in degree, from<br/>&gt; &gt; those of the higher prime-factors.  I find that the ratio 3:2, and<br/>&gt; &gt; to some extent 9:8, also have this effect of &quot;similarity&quot; but to<br/>&gt; &gt; a much lesser degree than 2:1.

Thanks for sharing your<br/>outlook on melodic perception.</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;BobWendell@t...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Well, first of all, by inversion I meant the classical concept of<br/>&gt; interval inversion and not  a fifth below as opposed to a fifth<br/>&gt; above. Those are both fifths. I&apos;m referring to the inversion of the<br/>&gt; fifth, which is the fourth, and which has a different melodic span &gt; in<br/>&gt; terms of pitch difference.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is much more relevant to the issue of octave displacement of<br/>&gt; selected notes in a melody. In that case, both the DIRECTION of<br/>&gt; motion is reversed, and the SPAN (PITCH DISTANCE) of the interval<br/>&gt; is changed. The further removed from a tritone the interval to be<br/>&gt; inverted is, the greater the change in pitch distance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m simply saying that Frere Jacque on C, for example, based on a<br/>&gt; motive with a pitch sequence of CDEC in the same octave, is a<br/>&gt; sequence of two upward stepwise motions and then a drop to the<br/>&gt; orginal pitch a third below. That is how we hear melody: by melodic<br/>&gt; contour!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If you transpose the initial C up an octave, you get an initial<br/>&gt; DOWNWARD motion of a seventh before proceeding to the E which, if<br/>&gt; we<br/>&gt; transpose it down an octave, entails another DOWNWARD motion of a<br/>&gt; seventh before returning to the untransposed final C a minor sixth<br/>&gt; ABOVE it. The melodic contour has been RADICALLY ALTERED by the<br/>&gt; octave transposition of two notes. This is why such a melody sounds<br/>&gt; so entirely different. We&apos;ve radically changed the melodic CONTOUR<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; terms of both directin of melodic movement and the DISTANCE of that<br/>&gt; motion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the &quot;expectation&quot; issue, if you take an unfamiliar melody and<br/>&gt; repeat it in its entirety with a whole octave displacement for<br/>&gt; every<br/>&gt; note without advising anyone that this is what you&apos;re going to do,<br/>&gt; anyone with the slightest quantum of musical perception will<br/>&gt; identify<br/>&gt; it as the same melody even if they don&apos;t know what an octave is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They may do the same thing for the same melody tranposed a fifth up<br/>&gt; or down, or any other interval, but it won&apos;t sound as if it were in<br/>&gt; the same key. I don&apos;t understand how anyone can seriously argue<br/>&gt; against the concept of octave equivalence. I&apos;ve never seen any<br/>&gt; evidence of its being a culturally conditioned phenomenon. It seems<br/>&gt; to be quite universal that men and women sing the same melody an<br/>&gt; octave apart and perceive each other as singing the same melody.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;unidala&quot; &lt;JGill99@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In tuning@y..., &quot;robert_wendell&quot; &lt;BobWendell@t...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I&apos;ve been hanging out on this one waiting to see who else<br/>&gt; &gt;would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; say it first.
