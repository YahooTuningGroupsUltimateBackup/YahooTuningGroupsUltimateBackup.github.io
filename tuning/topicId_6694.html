A<br/>lot of it is 13th and 14th century English polyphony. Not microtonal in the<br/>sense that we, on this list, intend, although the singers did, I think,<br/>attempt to make the major 3rds in the Landini cadences appropriately spicy.<br/>It&apos;s an ongoing project and they&apos;ve uncovered several complete pieces and of<br/>course, many fragments. The singers were Oxford students and they did a<br/>credible (but not truly professional) job at rendering the music, some of it<br/>quite attractive. You could hear an English flavour all right.<br/>Jay<br/>At 08:44 AM 12/7/99 -0700, you wrote:<br/>&gt;From: John Starrett &lt;<a href="mailto:jstarret@math.cudenver.edu">jstarret@math.cudenver.edu</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hey-<br/>&gt;&#x9;My wife told me last night that she heard some music on NPR that<br/>&gt;was found beneath other music on some parchment by a couple of Oxford<br/>&gt;musicologists by some new technique or other and that the performance<br/>&gt;sounded microtonal.
