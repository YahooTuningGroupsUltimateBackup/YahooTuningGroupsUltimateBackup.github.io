If we multiply all the notes of a<br/>&gt; (major or minor) JI tetrad together and ignore 2, we get a rational number</p><p>&gt; q = 3^a 5^b 7^c</p><p>Okay, so for instance 1/1 5/4 3/2 -&gt; 3*5, and 1/1 6/5 3/2 -&gt; 3^2*5^-1</p><p>How is it unique though, couldn&apos;t that also be<br/>1/1 9/8 8/5?</p><p>I know that isn&apos;t a major or minor chord, the question is, what is the<br/>way you determine if it is to count as a major or minor chord, and<br/>how you decide what way to distribute the numbers amongst the component<br/>notes of the triad.</p><p>Also I can&apos;t see yet how this is a lattice rather than just<br/>a geometrical shape - does say 3^21*5^11*7^13 or whatever<br/>correspond to any kind of a musical chord? Or are they just the<br/>chords near the centre of the latticd around the 1/1 that are<br/>of interest.</p><p>Can&apos;t help but feel I&apos;m missing something here.</p><p>&gt; which uniqely determines that chord. Transforming coordinates by using<br/>&gt;  instead [(b+c-2)/4,(a+c-2)/4,(a+b-2)/4] exhibits the tetrads as a cubic<br/>&gt;  lattice; every triple [a,b,c] corresponds to a tetrad, and two tetrads<br/>&gt; which share a common interval are one unit apart. If a+b+c<br/>&gt; is even, the tetrad is major, if odd, minor. The existence of this<br/>&gt; cubic lattice has to do with special facts about the lattice of notes<br/>&gt; in the 7-limit which do not obtain in other prime limits.</p><p>I&apos;ll wait until I understand the first part before getting onto understanding<br/>how you get a cubic lattice out of it.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2002 3:15:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; How is it unique though, couldn&apos;t that also be<br/>&gt; 1/1 9/8 8/5?</p><p>Not if we are only talking about major and minor tetrads, which are the lattice points of the lattice in question.</p><p>&gt; I know that isn&apos;t a major or minor chord, the question is, what is the<br/>&gt; way you determine if it is to count as a major or minor chord, and<br/>&gt; how you decide what way to distribute the numbers amongst the component<br/>&gt; notes of the triad.</p><p>1:3:5:7 major<br/>1:1/3:1/5:1/7 minor</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@ntlworld.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2002 4:03:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene</p><p>Sorry, I just don&apos;t understand yet what you are saying.</p><p>Not the specific point, but the basic idea of how the lattice as a whole works</p><p>Can you give a few concrete examples perhaps, and explain how<br/>you derive them?</p><p>E.g. 3^21*5^11*7^13  is going to be in your lattice somewhere.<br/>So what is that as a minor triad?</p><p>Then perhaps I&apos;ll understand what you mean when you say that<br/>the chords tile.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@juno.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/7/2002 4:40:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Can you give a few concrete examples perhaps, and explain how<br/>&gt; you derive them?</p><p>For a major tetrad, from q = 3^a 5^b 7^c we would have<br/>3^(a-1)/4 5^(b-1)/4 7^(c-1)/4 as the root of the chord.

So not so good as some but reasonable<br/>enough for many purposes.</p><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/quicktime/qtdevdocs/REF/tp_qtma_qtmaref.a.htm">http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/quicktime/qtdevdocs/REF/tp_qtma_qtmaref.a.htm</a></p><p>Of course, that means if you are happy with that level of resolution<br/>and also specify it in your midi file, you could have a single<br/>pitch bend swoop through the entire midi range of pitches :-).<br/>That&apos;s why they do it I think.</p><p>I think opening in a new window is okay for quicktime, but it would be<br/>nice if one could specify the size of it and make it just the right<br/>size for the midi clip play controls and no more - then one could also see<br/>the original page.</p><p>Would be even nicer if one could open them all in the same window.</p><p>I&apos;ll do that as soon as I can figure out how to do it, assuming it<br/>can be done. I ran into something there - that the javascript code<br/>that works in an ordinary link doesn&apos;t work in the links used for<br/>the image maps, so that needs investigating first. Instead it<br/>opens a blank new window with the url field at the top shown as<br/>&quot;Javascript:onClick=OpenInNewWin(&apos;1.mid&apos;)&quot; or whatever the javascript<br/>code is.</p><p>If anyone who is reading this happens to know what I need to put into the<br/>ulr field there to get it to work, do let me know :-).</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>11/15/2002 3:12:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Joseph,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, quicktime is reasonable enough pitch bend wise.<br/>&gt; The thing about it is that it translates all pitch bends<br/>&gt; you give it into fractional semitones (7 bits / semitone)<br/>&gt; i.e. 128 units per semitone, so the pitch bend resolution is a<br/>little<br/>&gt; under a cent.
