There was also a lesser-known<br/>recording piano, which captured much more of the nuances of a piano<br/>performance than the standard player piano. There are quite a few recordings<br/>of famous pianists captured with this device; I believe you can find CDs of<br/>these if you&apos;re interested.</p><p>Then there was Cahill&apos;s Telharmonium. This one, if my memory is correct, was<br/>proposed in 1895. The Telharmonium was a room full of rotating tone-wheel<br/>electronic sound generators very much like the tone wheels in the Hammond<br/>Organ. In fact, the Hammond folks had to deal with patent issues because<br/>Cahill patented the Telharmonium.</p><p>Cahill&apos;s plan was to distribute the music from the Telharmonium over<br/>telephone lines to businesses, like Muzak :-). This never happened, and I&apos;ve<br/>forgotten the details of the story, but Cahill is credited with the<br/>&quot;invention&quot; of additive sound synthesis in a number of references. I&apos;m sure<br/>a web search for Cahill and Telharmonium will turn up some of this history.<br/>--<br/>M.
