Note that Sims came upon<br/>the &quot;interesting&quot; decision to use a square root sign as an accidental<br/>for 1/4 tones.  Why?  Well, since the 1/4 tone is the square root of<br/>the semi tone, that seemed to make sense to him.</p><p>It&apos;s a terrible looking accidental (a &quot;radical&quot; one, pun intended),<br/>and the best we can do in an ascii emulation is:  [ or ].</p><p>But, the point is, it *STUCK* since Sims wrote music with it, and<br/>established the standard.</p><p>Since I&apos;m currently writing and distributing music with the F,C,G<br/>blackjack standard, this same phenominon could apply:  even if *my*<br/>standard were not the most intellectually rigorous one, it could<br/>*become* the standard just in usage...</p><p>Oh yes, that&apos;s more than possible.</p><p>Out of deference, though, to my friends on this list who have been<br/>working to engineer this tuning system, I have chosen to pay<br/>attention to the latest developments.</p><p>HOWEVER, I do know that Dave Keenan loves to &quot;twiddle&quot; around with<br/>these concepts until he reaches &quot;perfection.&quot;  There&apos;s nothing wrong<br/>with that, but if he were in the middle of composing pieces in the<br/>Blackjack tuning, he might have a different opinion about that!</p><p>So, we&apos;ll have to see.  For one thing, I don&apos;t think there really is<br/>a firm standard on it.  Oh... Jon, Allison is also composing in<br/>Blackjack.</p><p>Most people seem to accept the C-G-D-A standard, but I don&apos;t know if<br/>there&apos;s an &quot;official&quot; vote on it yet! :)  Certainly I don&apos;t want to<br/>change everything around and then find out there&apos;s been<br/>more &quot;tweaking&quot; and &quot;twiddle-twaddling&quot; and It&apos;s been &quot;improved&quot; once<br/>again!</p><p>Writing with this system, with common-tone lattices, etc., and new<br/>chord formations is complex, and I&apos;m just about gathering together a<br/>sense of a certain langage that I would like to use.</p><p>It is as if one starts to develop words of a language, and then,<br/>suddently, people want to start using a different *ALPHABET.*</p><p>In fact, in a musical sense, with the musical note names changing<br/>that&apos;s *exactly* what *is* going on!!!!</p><p>best,</p><p>JP</p></div><h3><a id=30669 href="#30669">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@ADNC.COM&#x3E;</h3><span>11/24/2001 5:32:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Joseph,</p><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; But, the point is, it *STUCK* since Sims wrote music with it, and<br/>&gt; established the standard.</p><p>Exactamente!</p><p>&gt; Oh...

However I would<br/>encourage you _not_ to change unless you _are_ absolutely convinced<br/>that it will be an improvement.</p><p>I remind you that, at a time when I was seriously considering the<br/>possibility that 3 naturals might be better than 4, and spending a<br/>considerable amount of time on the question by examining the Blackjack<br/>subset scales in the Scala archive, you said that you couldn&apos;t<br/>possibly argue that a system with 3 naturals was better than one with<br/>4. You also said you would place weight only on the real-world scales,<br/>and it turned out that there were _no_ real world scales that were<br/>better off with FCG, and four that were better off with CGDA (a<br/>Turkish major and minor and a Slovakian Gypsy major and minor).</p><p>&gt; 2) I will need some assistance converting everything... including my<br/>&gt; MIDI setup with the SCALA files, and various &quot;background&quot; materials<br/>&gt; that I have been using continuously to compose in Blackjack</p><p>Email me everything you&apos;ve got and I&apos;ll see what I can do. I&apos;ve<br/>already done the lattice and I will change Manuel&apos;s chord list to<br/>ASCIIfied-Sims notation ASAP. Yes he did use CGDA.</p><p>There are a few ways you can go with the keyboard mapping. If you map<br/>the middle C key to a B[ pitch you can leave all your stickers where<br/>they are. Or we can ask the question for the keyboard mapping that we<br/>did for the notation:</p><p>What Halberstadt keyboard mapping makes life simplest for someone<br/>trying to learn Blackjack from scratch, given the CGDA notation<br/>standard?</p><p>As far as actually implementing any particular mapping. I&apos;m afraid<br/>others may have to help you there.</p><p>As for as how you got into FCG in the first place ... I believe it was<br/>the fact that it made mathematical sense (but not necc. musical sense)<br/>to list the pitches starting from the one at the center of the chain<br/>of secors, combined with the default mapping of that note to C in the<br/>software you are using. i.e. No good reason.</p><p>&gt; 3) The question remains:  is this all really worth it?

Is there anything in particular still bothering<br/>you about whether CGDA is objectively better than CFG (on average)?</p><p>CGDA should make life with your cellist easier.

With two bows<br/>&gt; on each psaltery I can have long sustained tetrads.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The zithers are roughly bass and tenor (48&apos;&apos; and 36&quot;). They are tuned to<br/>the same hexany - if the<br/>&gt; bass has tones 1,2,3,4,5,6, the tenor has tones 5,6,1&apos; ,2&apos; ,3&apos; ,4&apos;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The mbira or &apos;rumba box&apos; will have a full Blackjack plus 5 or 6 tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I intend to lay out the bars in 3 sets of 12.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve decided to adopt the C G D A notation system. I appreciate Joseph&apos;s<br/>problems in converting<br/>&gt; and sympathise with him greatly. I&apos;m perhaps lucky in that I make models<br/>of  my compositional<br/>&gt; sketches on a TX - 802. I just need to re - bake a tuning with Jeff<br/>Scott&apos;s L&apos;il Miss Scale Oven<br/>&gt; and re-write a paper strip to stick on to my Master keyboard. I&apos;m<br/>conceptualising everything in<br/>&gt; scale tone numbers at the moment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The first pieces to be completed will be for soprano, counter-tenor two<br/>zithers and percussion. If<br/>&gt; I can work up a good enough synthesised version I might put it up on my<br/>webspace. The timescale<br/>&gt; for recording the &apos;live&apos; version depends on how well my singers adapt to<br/>Blackjack melody and<br/>&gt; harmony, but I don&apos;t intend making unreasonable demands.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; BTW, I disagree with Gene. Blackjack is an excellent scale to work with.<br/>It&apos;s much more than a<br/>&gt; scale - more like an organic musical system, at least IMHO.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You do not need web access to participate.

The top is strengthened with struts underneath and a solid two piece hardwood ( I used<br/>native Scottish hardwoods) bridge is glued on top. Two strips of steel are then glued to the two<br/>piece bridge. The &quot;keys&quot; are 1/8&quot; (or 3/16&quot;) spring tempered steel rods bent round bolts which<br/>screw into the steel strips. Then the keys are bent upwards to give them some twang. They are fine<br/>tuned by adjusting the length. This, the Rumba Box, is very much the Queen of mbiras.</p><p>I&apos;m no great maker, but the designs I followed from Hopkins&apos; book and &quot;Sound Designs&quot; by R. Banek<br/>and J. Scoville were clear and easy to follow. I would recommend these for ideas on tunable<br/>instruments. There are several books by Dennis Waring. &quot;Making Folk Instruments In Wood&quot; has some<br/>mbira designs.
