I find it rather fortunate that we have among us a<br/>chemist who knows music-making and delves into the music theory of<br/>microtones! (As a side note, my father, Prof. Dr. Tolga Yarman has<br/>tackled Chemical Engineering for many years during his Nuclear<br/>Engineering degree. He has been supporting me in my quest with his<br/>knowledge so far, and I, him on music theory.) Indeed, the goal here<br/>should be NOT ONLY to produce a wire that yields a &quot;truer&quot; overtone<br/>series, but also to eliminate (as much as possible) false beats<br/>(impurities?) and &quot;brighten&quot; &amp; &quot;enrich&quot; (excuse the pun) the tone of<br/>the piano. I surmise on conjecture and impression, that a Platinum-<br/>Osmium based compound piano wire might be made to exhibit better<br/>resistance to tensions, a greater elasticity and recoil, and an<br/>overall &quot;cleaner&quot; sound due to its ability to propagate wave energy<br/>with comparably smaller losses as opposed to spring steel. We should<br/>have improved non-corrosiveness as a bonus.</p><p>@ Carl: Thanks for the comments. However, I approach with caution to<br/>your suggestion of amorphous metals as piano wire. The crystalline<br/>structure&apos;s presence in steel wire (I conjecture) most likely serves<br/>to propagate wave energy with minimal loss. A structure that is<br/>disorderly and haphazardly arranged would be analogous to a bumpy road<br/>where packets of wave energy would be absorbed back to the detriment<br/>of purity of tone. This should create problems with noticable<br/>&quot;ringing&quot; and worse false beats. The goal is to ensure not only higher<br/>tensile strength and elasticity, but also to assure smoother<br/>conduciveness for transverse sound waves in the wire.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Cris">@Cris</a>: I shall find ways to acquire your book and try to put to good<br/>use your directions. Thank you.</p><p>Back at Chris Vaisvil: I have found out from the website you kindly<br/>provided the link to that a 0.8 mm Platinum wire 120 meters long<br/>weighs about 1.2 kgs. That should cost 50.000 US dollars on average in<br/>the market today. In times of economic crises, price of Platinum is<br/>said to fall below Gold. It fluctuates by the hour in stockmarkets.<br/>The tensile strength given in the sheet is still 1/10th of the desired<br/>value in the case of Platinum Group alloys. In my budget, this equates<br/>to just 20 grams to mix in trace amounts (1 in 60 parts).</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Dr. Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Aug 9, 2010, at 3:17 AM, c_ml_forster wrote:</p><p>&gt; To calculate the dimensionless stiffness parameter, or the<br/>&gt; coefficient of inharmonicity, of a given string one must know<br/>&gt; Young&apos;s modulus of elasticity of the stringing material; end of story.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To calculate the break strength of a given string, one must know the<br/>&gt; tensile strength of the stringing material; end of story.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;carl@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Hi Ozan,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Harmonicity of a piano string is mostly determined by two<br/>&gt;&gt; factors: tensile strength and elasticity.
