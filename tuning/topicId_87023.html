That&apos;s especially a lot for a scale that&apos;s been superseded by the Silver-section scale and now by a modified Ptolemic scale, both designed to improve consonance with harmonic-series-overtone instruments.<br/>  Also to note, it turns out Cameron has been using similar &quot;sectional mirroring&quot; to what I used to create the PHI-ter scale (and the Silver sections scale) all along, but in JI (or only slightly de-tuned from JI) tunings.   Between the downloads and his own success with helping me apply mirroring to optimize and modify Ptolemic-interval-based scales, I have no doubt the &quot;mirroring&quot; notes around simple ratios such as the octave, fifth, and square root of 2 plays a huge role in helping the brain organize tones regardless of if the scale is &quot;JI-friendly/compliant&quot; or not.</p><p>     Far as the 12-tone...you know I don&apos;t even think I remember with one I&apos;ve done a whole bunch of those...but the one I think you are talking about is a 14-tone tuning I was bugging everyone about (because I&apos;m still convinced it&apos;s very useful), is that correct?<br/>  The 14-tone is basically a Ptolemy Homalon based scale doubled up and using the mirroring technique to make it sound more &quot;together&quot;. IMVHO, it is the easier scale to compose with I have ever tried (even easier than Wilson&apos;s Six Hexanies scale and the 6th-12th harmonic series partials).<br/>    As such is virtually impossible to make out-of-tune sounding chords with (the way to add dissonance is simply to add more notes and more notes closer together.</p><p>  Some of you make thing I&apos;m a bit crazy with my &quot;scale which is a huge chord and is almost impossible to hit a sour note in&quot; obsession...but think about it....people&apos;s main complaint about micro-tuning is &quot;12TET is hard enough&quot;...and what&apos;s easier to play in (at least in theory) than a scale where there is virtually no way to go out of tune?   I hope this will prove to be a good way to get non-micro-tonal musicians interested in composing micro-tonal music.</p><p>________________________________<br/>From: Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt;<br/>To: <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Sent: Wed, March 24, 2010 10:39:07 AM<br/>Subject: [tuning] The mystery of Michael S. tunings continue</p><p>The numbers after the links indicates full downloads for so far this month.</p><p>(the link depends on where I posted the file - its the same file)</p><p><a href="http://micro">http://micro</a>. soonlabel. com/phiter2/ phiter-rev- synth.mp3   118</p><p><a href="http://clones">http://clones</a>. soonlabel. com/public/ micro/phiter2/ phiter-rev- synth.mp3  1830</p><p>This is about a factor of 10 greater downloads than my next popular piece.</p><p>Michael - you had a 12 note tuning you wanted me to try - can you post that again - it got lost in the shuffle.</p><p>Chris</p></div><h3><a id=87028 href="#87028">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/24/2010 12:24:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Almost 2,000 Mike - 1830 + 118 = 1948 downloads</p><p>Well, then, can you pass along the 14 note tuning?</p><p>I tried searching the tuning list for it w/o any luck.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Wed, Mar 24, 2010 at 2:44 PM, Michael &lt;djtrancendance@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Chris....<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     And wow....good grief...over 1000 downloads?!
