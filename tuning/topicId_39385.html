Well, you seem to disagree,<br/>&gt;although without any evidence to refute this 10 year old paper.<br/>&gt;I assumed you brought up qwerty as an example of a technology<br/>&gt;that got locked in for arbitrary reasons.

Having used both for years, I can<br/>tell you that I believe the only possible advantage of VHS over<br/>Beta was longer tapes.  And considering that Beta tapes could<br/>play as long as a DVD, I think this advantage was not<br/>significant.  In fact, I think the shorter tapes were better,<br/>because the tapes were smaller.

But<br/>&gt;network effects are surely irrelevant????</p><p>The vertebrate retina works well enough that the cost of evolving<br/>a new one isn&apos;t justified.  Yet, the cephalopod design appears to<br/>be plainly superior.  Call it what you will.

In the States, if you go to fast food,<br/>your drink comes in a wax-paper cup with a snap-on lid with an &quot;x&quot;<br/>cut in it for the straw.  This setup is notorious for leaking<br/>sticky soda all over creation.  The other day I went to a Thai<br/>tapioca-drink franchise.  They just slap adhesive film on the top,<br/>and the straw is sharp on one end.  Less waste, less expensive,<br/>no spills, more sanitary to apply the lid.</p><p>&gt;&gt;Incidentally, I do agree that network effects were far over-<br/>&gt;&gt;estimated by the .coms.
