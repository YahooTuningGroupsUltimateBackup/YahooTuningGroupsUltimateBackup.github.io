I don&apos;t often concern myself with the latter.</p><p>It was therefore really nice to see your adoption of<br/>orthodox Fokker unison-vectors in examining the periodicity<br/>inherent in your own interesting recent theory of 7-limit<br/>decatonic scales.  Naturally, with my background, I find<br/>your decatonic theory much easier to understand with<br/>this thorough lattice-oriented presentation.</p><p>Here&apos;s my brief critique:</p><p>General points:</p><p>First, a compliment on your choice of font.  I loathe<br/>&quot;Times New Roman&quot; (the Windows default font on<br/>*everything*) and never use it, and am very glad to<br/>see that you made such an audacious choice.  The<br/>&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; Windows font is one that I&apos;ve only<br/>had the nerve to use on stuff I&apos;ve made for children.<br/>I get the feeling that you&apos;re really &quot;thumbing your nose&quot;<br/>at the music-theory establishment by publishing such<br/>an intellectual theory paper in a comical font!<br/>(If that wasn&apos;t your intention, then I&apos;m sorry to<br/>read so much into it, but that&apos;s how it struck me.)</p><p>Second, a big criticism: there are no page numbers!</p><p>Now, some more specific things:</p><p>In the first section, you note how closely your harmonic<br/>entropy graph resembles Partch&apos;s &quot;One-Footed Bride&quot;.<br/>But it should also be pointed out that both are nearly<br/>identical to Helmholtz&apos;s &quot;Fig. 60 A&quot; and &quot;Fig. 60 B&quot;,<br/>on page 193 in the Dover reprint of Ellis&apos;s translation<br/>of _On the Sensations of Tone_, which is the earliest<br/>example of this type of graph that I know of.</p><p>You should state in the text accompanying Figures 5, 6,<br/>and 8 that the periodicity between *entire blocks* is<br/>shown by the arrows with the ratios.  I can<br/>understand now why you would think this should be<br/>self-evident, but it still took me a while<br/>to realize it.  My first reaction was that the arrows<br/>on the lattices were supposed to connect *specific pairs<br/>of pitches*.</p><p>Also, all of the lattices in your paper should have<br/>the ratios along with the note-names!</p><p>I found that the last section, &quot;Symmetrical Decatonic Scales&quot;,<br/>required a difficult conceptual leap from diatonic to<br/>decatonic.  I realize that you provided me (and probably<br/>others too) with a newly revised copy of your previous paper<br/>(_Tuning, Tonality, and 22-tone Temperament_), which gives a<br/>detailed evolution and explanation of the latter, but I still<br/>think it would be good to review an *example* of a symmetrical<br/>decatonic scale *first*, complete with some sort of pitch-height<br/>graph, your own staff notation, and cents values, before jumping<br/>in and using it on the lattice.</p><p>Indeed, I feel that in general this paper could be improved<br/>with several illustrations using staff-notation and pitch-height<br/>graphs.  It focuses almost entirely on the perception of<br/>harmonic pitch relationships in ratio-space, and provides<br/>nothing at all on the more commonly understood perception<br/>of pitch in pitch-space.  Presenting both types of visual<br/>information would aid in allowing the reader to make the<br/>connections between the two types of perception, especially<br/>since the 7-limit decatonic scales are quite a different<br/>animal from the 5-limit diatonic scales normally encountered.<br/>In particular, I found myself wishing that you had correlated<br/>the staff notation of the decatonic scales from your previous<br/>paper with the integer-plus-up/down-signs which you *do* give<br/>on the lattices.</p><p>Perhaps Figures 5 and 7 could be better if broken up into<br/>several smaller figures... but maybe not.  I don&apos;t have<br/>a strong opinion on this one.</p><p>A final compliment:  Great use of color (or, actually, of<br/>grey) in figures 6 and 8 to show the unique membership of<br/>each ratio in a particular periodicity-block!</p><p>Lastly, you sent me, in a separate envelope, a single<br/>sheet containing Figure 10.  I assumed it was to correct<br/>an error, but I haven&apos;t been able to detect any difference<br/>between it and the Figure 10 bound into your paper.<br/>Why the extra copy?</p><p>Good job!</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=22084 href="#22084">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@yahoo.com&#x3E;</h3><span>5/4/2001 2:21:05 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Thanks for sending me your new paper!<br/>&gt; (_The Forms of Tonality: a preview_)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps Figures 5 and 7 could be better if broken up into<br/>&gt; several smaller figures... but maybe not.

There must be some reason for this...  the<br/>&quot;sensitivity&quot; rating of the graph??  Dunno...</p><p>&gt; You should state in the text accompanying Figures 5, 6,<br/>&gt; and 8 that the periodicity between *entire blocks* is<br/>&gt; shown by the arrows with the ratios.  I can<br/>&gt; understand now why you would think this should be<br/>&gt; self-evident, but it still took me a while<br/>&gt; to realize it.  My first reaction was that the arrows<br/>&gt; on the lattices were supposed to connect *specific pairs<br/>&gt; of pitches*.<br/>&gt;</p><p>I had no trouble with this, especially since all the pitches are<br/>labeled and it is clear that they rise by the &quot;chromatic semitone&quot;<br/>ratio...

That would look rather complex, no??</p><p>The point of this is that Paul, for once, is making things *SIMPLER*<br/>rather than intentionally more complex...  :)</p><p>&gt; Indeed, I feel that in general this paper could be improved<br/>&gt; with several illustrations using staff-notation and pitch-height<br/>&gt; graphs.</p><p>Isn&apos;t that at the very end for the decatonic, though??

Partch, and other scale theorists, like to assume<br/>octave equivalence (even though it&apos;s clearly not perfectly true in practice . . . different chord<br/>inversions can be different in consonance) because it greatly simplifies the scale-construction<br/>process, if you know you&apos;re going to be focusing on octave-repeating scales anyway. Figure 2<br/>or the One-Footed Bride, as you can see, gives you only one consonance value for every<br/>interval class -- a minor third and major sixth get identical consonance values -- which allows you<br/>to ignore octave register when constructing chords and scales. If you were interested in<br/>constructing scales that don&apos;t repeat themselves exactly every octave, you&apos;d probably want to<br/>use a consonance curve like the one in Figure 1 as your basis.</p><p>For further questions about harmonic entropy, please post to<br/><a href="mailto:harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com">harmonic_entropy@yahoogroups.com</a>.</p></div><h3><a id=22212 href="#22212">ðŸ”—</a>paul@stretch-music.com</h3><span>5/6/2001 7:19:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In tuning@y..., paul@s... wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="/tuning/topicId_22081.html#22156">/tuning/topicId_22081.html#22156</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If the 81:80 (which is four 3:2s up and one 5:4 down, mod the<br/>&gt; octave) vanishes, and if fixed<br/>&gt; &gt; pitches are used, then four fifths up must equal a major third in<br/>&gt; the diatonic tuning in<br/>&gt; &gt; question.

Could you please elaborate<br/>&gt; or perhaps include an example so I can understand this better!</p><p>Hi Joe.  I&apos;m not Paul, but I&apos;ll give it a shot.</p><p>First, you should re-read Paul&apos;s &quot;Gentle Introduction to<br/>Periodicity Blocks&quot;, starting at:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm</a></p><p>I&apos;m rusty on my remembrance of Fokker&apos;s papers right now,<br/>so I can&apos;t speak on Fokker&apos;s observations.  But as far as I<br/>know, Paul and I discovered on our own (when I visited<br/>him a couple of years ago) that if one&apos;s concern is to<br/>create a temperament and you choose your unison vectors<br/>carefully, each unison vector removes one dimension from<br/>the lattice, and the final unison vector is the one that<br/>closes the system; i.e., changes it from an infinite system<br/>to a finite one.</p><p>For example, the linear (= 1-dimensional) chain of 3:2s<br/>theoretically goes on forever.  But if you use 3^12<br/>(= the Pythagorean Comma) as your unison vector (and<br/>assuming &quot;octave&quot; equivalence, so we&apos;ll omit prime-factor 2<br/>and its exponents), then every *pair* of pitch-classes<br/>that is separated by that interval will be treated as a<br/>*single* pitch-class.  Therefore the system will be limited<br/>(= closed) to a linear chain of 12 &quot;5ths&quot;.  It doesn&apos;t<br/>matter whether these &quot;5ths&quot; are actual 3:2 ratios or<br/>tempered - it works the same way in either case.</p><p>A 5-limit system (or any other) is also theoretically<br/>infinite.  A typical pair of unison vectors in a 5-limit<br/>system is the Syntonic Comma (= 3^4 * 5^-1) and the<br/>Diesis (= 5^3).  Paul illustrates the resulting periodicity<br/>block in Gentle Introduction, Part 2.  This, and the<br/>5-limit periodicity blocks he illustrates in his latest<br/>paper, are still 2-dimensional.</p><p>The point here, as it relates to your question, is that<br/>if we were trying to create a temperament to represent<br/>5-limit JI - for instance, a meantone - we could find a<br/>unison vector that would turn the 2-dimensional lattice<br/>into a 1-dimensional (linear) one - I think the Syntonic<br/>Comma would do the trick - and then we could employ the<br/>Pythagorean Comma to close that linear system as we saw above.</p><p>(Paul, Kees, Manuel... please comment if I&apos;m wrong here.)</p><p>So even tho meantone is intended to represent the 2-dimensional<br/>5-limit system, it is actually constituted as a chain of<br/>tempered &quot;5ths&quot;, and thus is a linear, 1-dimensional system.</p><p>Note that meantones do not have to be finite systems - we&apos;ve<br/>talked here often of how 19-EDO and 31-EDO emulate 1/3-comma<br/>and 1/4-comma meantone, respectively.  Meantones are most<br/>often found with only 12 notes, for obvious reasons relating<br/>to keyboard design, but if 1/3-comma meantone were carried<br/>out to 19 notes, it would be nearly identical to 19-EDO,<br/>and likewise, if 1/4-comma meantone were carried out to<br/>31 notes, it would be nearly identical to 31-EDO.  But<br/>those are still arbitrary stopping points - the chain of<br/>meantone tempered &quot;5ths&quot; can be infinite just like the<br/>chain of untempered 3:2s.</p><p>Equal-temperaments, or EDOs, on the other hand, are closed,<br/>finite systems, because they cycle back to a note that is<br/>*identical* (assuming &quot;octave&quot; equivalence) to the starting note.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p></div><h3><a id=22329 href="#22329">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@rcn.com</h3><span>5/9/2001 9:49:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In tuning@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_22081.html#22316">/tuning/topicId_22081.html#22316</a></p><p>&gt; First, you should re-read Paul&apos;s &quot;Gentle Introduction to<br/>&gt; Periodicity Blocks&quot;, starting at:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/td/erlich/intropblock1.htm</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>Actually, I forgot how generally excellent these articles really<br/>are... and I got more out of them *this* time than on any previous<br/>reads...
