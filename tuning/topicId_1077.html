Just as Bartok&apos;s &quot;Major<br/>Sevenths, Minor Seconds&quot; demonstrates that these intervals need not<br/>always be treated as strong discords, so composers such as Gary<br/>Morrison with his 88-cet systems have demonstrated that a &quot;supermajor<br/>third&quot; at or near 9:7 (5 scale steps or 440 cents in 88-cet) can<br/>indeed be felt as a concord.</p><p>My point was only that while many people have recognized the<br/>_unstable_ nature of the major third in a 13th-century context (which<br/>might be better realized by either 81:64 or 9:7 as opposed to 5:4),<br/>the _relatively concordant_ nature of this interval points to 81:64 as<br/>opposed to 9:7. In a different artistic context -- say 11-limit JI --<br/>Gothic norms of concord/discord are no longer necessarily relevant,<br/>and 9:7 could easily become an independent concord.</p><p>Incidentally, I might note in passing that two theorists of the<br/>Renaissance-Manneristic era do specifically assert that 81:64 would be<br/>a &quot;dissonance,&quot; not a valid concord, as opposed to 5:4. Both Zarlino<br/>(1558) and Lippius (1612) make this point in declaring that modern<br/>practice depends on the syntonic diatonic tuning of Ptolemy with its<br/>pure 5-based ratios for thirds and sixths, as opposed to the<br/>Pythagorean or &quot;ditonal diatonic&quot; with its more complex ratios.</p><p>As Bill Alves has rightly emphasized, Vicentino (1555) makes a similar<br/>point in reviewing the Pythagorean theory of Boethius, but then<br/>championing Ptolemy as the basic for the modern practice of &quot;mixed and<br/>tempered music&quot; which approximates the ideally blending ratios for<br/>thirds at 5:4 and 6:5.</p><p>On the topic of categorical perception, Lippius offers especially<br/>striking (and controversial) remarks against some of the alleged<br/>misconceptions of his contemporaries. Specifically, he rebuts the view<br/>of those who say that a Pythagorean major third is &quot;a dissonance to<br/>the intellect, but a consonance to the senses.&quot; Such a stance could<br/>reflect both Lippius&apos;s ardent allegiance to Ptolemy&apos;s system of pure<br/>5-based ratios (whose summa is the _trias harmonica_), and his own<br/>perception that 81:64 is not a &quot;reasonable facsimile&quot; of 5:4.</p><p>A wild hypothesis: is it possible that in a relatively &quot;heterogenous&quot;<br/>harmonic texture based on bold contrasts between stable and unstable<br/>sonorities (Gothic or Baroque), an 81:64 may seem more &quot;concordant&quot;<br/>than in the uniquely homogenous tertian texture of the Renaissance? If<br/>so, we may have an one explanation of why this tuning for some major<br/>thirds is more acceptable to Werckmeister than to Zarlino or Lippius.</p><p>Most respectfully,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/><a href="mailto:mschulter@value.net">mschulter@value.net</a></p></div><h3>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;DJWOLF_MATERIAL@xxxxxxxxxx.xxxx&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/1999 3:40:16 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Let me clarify once more. La Monte Young&apos;s 9/7 works in the string quartet<br/>largely because of the high tessitura (the lowest 9/7 is between f&quot; and a&quot;)<br/>and the natural harmonic timbres.  In _The Well Tuned Piano_ , the same<br/>interval appear in lower octaves but always first in the context of a<br/>larger chord or sonority. The 9/7 interval is extracted from this complex<br/>over a long period of time.</p><p>A more important aspect of TWTP is, perhaps, the simple fact that for much<br/>of the work, a 9/7 is the only Major third available.  Ironically, this<br/>ends up a bit analogous to a temperament where one accepts a given complex<br/>interval playing the role of a less complex one.  I think this is not the<br/>case in _Chronos Kristalla_, however, because the 9/7 is really heard as<br/>the interval between the 7th and 9th partials.  Incidentally, portions of<br/>_Chronos_ sound very much like sho (mouth organ) playing in left side<br/>Gagaku, which have traditionally used wider Major thirds.</p><p>I agree with Margo Schulter&apos;s posting about the unlikeliness of the 9/7 in<br/>medieval music.  The tessitura of gothic polyphony  seems to me to be just<br/>too low to project the interval (unlike Young&apos;s harmonics). On the other<br/>hand, use of the interval in mannerist cadences, e.g. those resolving to<br/>the outer fifth, while probably not practiced historically, would be well<br/>within the mannerist &apos;project&apos;.  (I offer this as a challenge to Brian<br/>Ferneyhough, who considers his music -- with its essentially  arbitrary use<br/>of quartertones --  to be mannerist.  The historical mannerists were often<br/>exotic but never arbitrary).</p></div>
