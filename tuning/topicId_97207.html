The lowest triad between 6:7:9 and 10:12:15 is 16:19:24, followed by 22:26:33.

If you check out the<br/>&gt; pattern of coincident partials in a pure 7:6, you&apos;ll find that it offers an interesting<br/>&gt; combination of coincidences within a pattern of strongly dissonant partial relationships, &gt; tending to ride quite a bit in critical band areas. So, by getting very close to 7:6, you lose &gt; the smoothing of the coincidences but keep the clanging of the dissonances.

Using sine wave tones the &quot;strength&quot; of a JI interval is, according to my formula:</p><p>(2 + 1/x + 1/y - y/x)/2</p><p>Note the above applies only when y/x&lt;=0.9375 and x and y&lt;256.</p><p>It seems to my ear that any *sine wave* dyad with a value less than 0.75 is no good.</p><p>I used the same formula to work out the strength value of the 6:7:9 sine wave triad and it has a value of 0.77 (greater than the cut-off point of 0.75 mentioned above). The maths say that the chord should sound good but if I listen carefully the 7/6 interval within the chord sounds bad and therefore the chord is bad. 7/6 on it&apos;s own has a value of 0.726 which is less than the cut-off point of 0.75. (Note that 7/6 is perfectly acceptable using complex tones with a &apos;regular&apos; harmonic series, it only sounds bad using sine waves.) So it seems that even if the chord has an overall value equal to or greater than 0.75, if it contains at least one &quot;bad&quot; interval it should be illegal.</p><p>Next I worked out the strength value of a justly tuned sine wave minor chord:<br/>10,15,20,24,30,40<br/>and I got a value of -0.49. The maths say that the chord should be bad but it sounds okay (although definitely minor).<br/>In this case, all the dyads within the chord are good (value&gt;=0.75).</p><p>The point I am making is that it seems that as long as all the dyads in a chord are good, then the chord should be good.</p><p>With regard to HE, as long as all the dyads in a chord are &quot;good&quot; according to 2HE then there should be no need to work out triadic HE (3HE), or for that matter 4HE, 5HE, 6HE etc.</p><p>Although 3+HE would be useful for quantifying the &quot;strengths&quot; of chords with 3 or more notes.</p><p>John.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I hope Carl and Steve will read this as well.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lobawad&quot; &lt;lobawad@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; 24, 17, and 21 don&apos;t sound like 7/6 to me.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I find that 17 and 21 sound like very dark minor thirds, not subminor thirds.

The lowest triad between 6:7:9 and 10:12:15 is 16:19:24, followed by 22:26:33.

If<br/>you load up a synth and set the timbre equal to three sine waves in a<br/>perfect 10:12:15 ratio, chances are that you&apos;ll hear the whole<br/>structure as a 5 with a slightly inharmonic, bell-like timbre.

Just<br/>because you don&apos;t like my specific way of explaining what this<br/>mysterious thing is doesn&apos;t mean you should miss the forest for the<br/>trees. You can do this listening test on your own and confirm that<br/>it&apos;s true: 10:12:15, in a timbre, sounds more like a bell playing 5<br/>than a sawtooth playing 1.</p><p>3HE is something that didn&apos;t exist until a few months ago, and these<br/>drawbacks apply to it, since it doesn&apos;t actually look at all of the<br/>subsets in the chord, just the chord as a whole.

If<br/>you play these chords with sine waves the same perception will result.<br/>If by partials beating with one another you&apos;re talking about the<br/>actual roots beating against one another, as in the &quot;periodicity buzz&quot;<br/>sense, then there might be something there - I&apos;ve been reading a lot<br/>of research on that lately - but it has never been addressed how<br/>periodicity buzz might contribute to f0 estimation here before.</p><p>But my point was that if you&apos;re hearing 6:7:9 as an actual 6:7:9, i.e.<br/>you&apos;re hearing a C subminor triad as being the upper partials of an F,<br/>then all of this doesn&apos;t apply, does it? It only sounds &quot;minor&quot; in the<br/>sense that you know the notes are in a roughly minor proportion, but<br/>it doesn&apos;t sound sad anymore. Nor does it sound rooted. So my point<br/>was that if you put a 3 in there, that creates an extremely strong<br/>1:2:3 structure at the 3:6:9, which as I and others have said is<br/>important because you need to look at all of the subsets of the chord,<br/>not just the chord itself.</p><p>I wouldn&apos;t expect that comparing different minor chords like this is<br/>something that 3HE will excel at because if you aren&apos;t looking at the<br/>HE of the subsets of the chord, then you aren&apos;t actually looking at<br/>the things that cause minorness. 3HE might indirectly yield decent<br/>results for this anyway by coincidence, but this is one of the known<br/>limitations of just calculating the entropy of the triad without<br/>looking at the constituent dyads.

If 3HE is still a work in progress, then there&apos;s no point in me complaining about it.</p><p>&gt; What does partials beating with one another have to do with this?</p><p>This is about predicting the concordance of tempered chords.  Concordance is just another word for timbral/harmonic fusion, and where there is audible beating, there is no fusion taking place.</p><p>The whole reason I&apos;m going on and on about this is because 14-EDO&apos;s subminor triad sounds worse than 21-EDO&apos;s and even 23-EDO&apos;s, despite the fact that it is closer to 6:7:9 than the other two.  I wanted to know if 3HE could explain why this is, and (in the state it currently exists), it can&apos;t.  So far the only person who&apos;s given me any sort of an explanation is Lobawad, who has told me that looking at the coincidence of partials in a 6:7:9 triad explains why it should be more sensitive to a slight mistuning than to a gross mistuning.</p><p>That explanation actually makes sense to me, and maybe even also explains why I find 17-TET to be more concordant than 12-TET when it comes to playing major triads: harmonic identities associated with higher partials (like 7/6, 9/7, and even 5/4) could be more sensitive to a slight mistuning  than a gross one because of critical band effects between the higher partials of a sound.  If you actually listen to the sound example I posted, you can definitely hear beating between the higher partials.  I may have done the math wrong, but assuming I haven&apos;t, the frequency difference between the higher partials of two tones is going to be larger than the frequency difference between the root tones.</p><p>For example, according to my calculations based on a fundamental of 400 Hz, there will be critical band dissonance between the 5th partial of the fundamental and the 4th partial of a note a 12-TET major 3rd above it, but there will NOT be critical band dissonance between the 5th partial of the fundamental and the 4th partial of a note a 17-TET supermajor 3rd above it.  So regardless of the fact that 12-TET&apos;s 3rd is closer to a 5/4, 17&apos;s actually sounds better because it creates less audible beating in some registers.</p><p>To me, beating is the only factor of concordance that matters, because the only reason concordance is of interest to me in the first place is because it&apos;s supposed to tell me how high I can crank up the fuzz pedal on an interval and not have it go to s***.</p><p>And I have to say, recent events have made me entirely re-think my view of the importance of &quot;approximation&quot; in tempering.  I used to think that just looking at absolute error from the nearest Just interval was enough, but now I see it&apos;s a lot more complicated than that.

In this case it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; better than nothing, but it&apos;s still not the 3HE + 2HE of every dyad +<br/>&gt; &gt; seeing how different f0&apos;s align with one another master solution that<br/>&gt; &gt; has been proposed. Your comments are valid but they don&apos;t cast any<br/>&gt; &gt; additional doubt on 3HE as a model because the whole thing is only<br/>&gt; &gt; half done.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is a completely different objection to my &quot;complaint&quot;, and this one actually seems valid. If 3HE is still a work in progress, then there&apos;s no point in me complaining about it.</p><p>It&apos;s not a completely different objection; the one was supposed to<br/>lead into the other. Like, here&apos;s the psychoacoustic tonalness<br/>concept, and here&apos;s what we know from it, and here&apos;s how it applies to<br/>HE, and hence here&apos;s the big picture and why it applies to your<br/>criticism of the model.</p><p>&gt; &gt; What does partials beating with one another have to do with this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is about predicting the concordance of tempered chords. Concordance is just another word for timbral/harmonic fusion, and where there is audible beating, there is no fusion taking place.</p><p>Since when? There&apos;s audible beating on the fifths in 22 and 27 equal,<br/>but they&apos;re still more concordant than sqrt(2). If I play a C-G dyad<br/>and put a chorus pedal on it, the whole thing will &quot;beat,&quot; and it&apos;ll<br/>still sound concordant.</p><p>&gt; The whole reason I&apos;m going on and on about this is because 14-EDO&apos;s subminor triad sounds worse than 21-EDO&apos;s and even 23-EDO&apos;s, despite the fact that it is closer to 6:7:9 than the other two. I wanted to know if 3HE could explain why this is, and (in the state it currently exists), it can&apos;t. So far the only person who&apos;s given me any sort of an explanation is Lobawad, who has told me that looking at the coincidence of partials in a 6:7:9 triad explains why it should be more sensitive to a slight mistuning than to a gross mistuning.</p><p>Setharean dissonance is very important. Do you still feel that the<br/>chords rank the same way if you use sine waves?</p><p>&gt; That explanation actually makes sense to me, and maybe even also explains why I find 17-TET to be more concordant than 12-TET when it comes to playing major triads: harmonic identities associated with higher partials (like 7/6, 9/7, and even 5/4) could be more sensitive to a slight mistuning than a gross one because of critical band effects between the higher partials of a sound. If you actually listen to the sound example I posted, you can definitely hear beating between the higher partials. I may have done the math wrong, but assuming I haven&apos;t, the frequency difference between the higher partials of two tones is going to be larger than the frequency difference between the root tones.</p><p>Then maybe I misunderstood you; I think this is definitely true, but I<br/>just think there are different things going on, all of which can cause<br/>unpleasant &quot;dissonance&quot;-like sensations to arise. There&apos;s no point<br/>comparing the two to see what makes better predictions, because there<br/>are multiple things that can cause dissonance and both are valid in<br/>different respects.</p><p>&gt; For example, according to my calculations based on a fundamental of 400 Hz, there will be critical band dissonance between the 5th partial of the fundamental and the 4th partial of a note a 12-TET major 3rd above it, but there will NOT be critical band dissonance between the 5th partial of the fundamental and the 4th partial of a note a 17-TET supermajor 3rd above it. So regardless of the fact that 12-TET&apos;s 3rd is closer to a 5/4, 17&apos;s actually sounds better because it creates less audible beating in some registers.</p><p>Yes, but the further you get away from 5/4, the more it starts<br/>sounding dissonant for other reasons. 450 cents, for instance, doesn&apos;t<br/>have any beating at all, but you&apos;ve said that you hate it. So both of<br/>them play a factor.</p><p>Perhaps what would satisfy you is to multiply the two curves together<br/>pointwise, such that you get a combined dissonance rating that factors<br/>both of them into account. That way there&apos;s still a &quot;bad spot&quot; around<br/>5/4 where critical band dissonance reaches a peak, but then once you<br/>get out of that, although it may go back down for a little bit,<br/>dissonance will then go back up as the major third goes into 450 cent<br/>territory and beyond; and then back down once it gets into 4/3<br/>territory and so on.</p><p>&gt; To me, beating is the only factor of concordance that matters, because the only reason concordance is of interest to me in the first place is because it&apos;s supposed to tell me how high I can crank up the fuzz pedal on an interval and not have it go to s***.</p><p>That has far more to do with HE than it has to do with beating. I&apos;ll<br/>spare you the mathematics involved - just minor chords and just major<br/>chords both beat the same, but they end up sounding completely<br/>different if you put distortion on them, whether you do it with sine<br/>waves or not. The reason has to do with that distortion generates sum<br/>and difference tones as well as perfectly harmonic combination tones -<br/>so for a tempered interval these tones will end up falling very near<br/>to one another and you&apos;ll get a huge complex of tones so closely<br/>packed that the resulting beating clusterf*#@&amp; will make you want to<br/>die. This doesn&apos;t happen for JI intervals, where all of the resultant<br/>tones overlap.</p><p>&gt; And I have to say, recent events have made me entirely re-think my view of the importance of &quot;approximation&quot; in tempering.

So you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; have to take that into account.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Who&apos;s talking about the perception of a chord? I&apos;m talking about *concordance*.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...Is concordance not a percept of chords today?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t give a damn what rational identity the brain is associating with these tempered chords, just how concordant they sound. I thought HE is supposed to model concordance?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When did I ever say anything about giving it a rational identity? If<br/>&gt; anything it seemed like that&apos;s what you were doing, talking about the<br/>&gt; field of attraction for 10:12:15 and 6:7:9 and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3HE is something that didn&apos;t exist until a few months ago, and these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; drawbacks apply to it, since it doesn&apos;t actually look at all of the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; subsets in the chord, just the chord as a whole. In this case it&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; better than nothing, but it&apos;s still not the 3HE + 2HE of every dyad +<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; seeing how different f0&apos;s align with one another master solution that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; has been proposed. Your comments are valid but they don&apos;t cast any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; additional doubt on 3HE as a model because the whole thing is only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; half done.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is a completely different objection to my &quot;complaint&quot;, and this one actually seems valid. If 3HE is still a work in progress, then there&apos;s no point in me complaining about it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s not a completely different objection; the one was supposed to<br/>&gt; lead into the other. Like, here&apos;s the psychoacoustic tonalness<br/>&gt; concept, and here&apos;s what we know from it, and here&apos;s how it applies to<br/>&gt; HE, and hence here&apos;s the big picture and why it applies to your<br/>&gt; criticism of the model.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What does partials beating with one another have to do with this?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is about predicting the concordance of tempered chords. Concordance is just another word for timbral/harmonic fusion, and where there is audible beating, there is no fusion taking place.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Since when? There&apos;s audible beating on the fifths in 22 and 27 equal,<br/>&gt; but they&apos;re still more concordant than sqrt(2). If I play a C-G dyad<br/>&gt; and put a chorus pedal on it, the whole thing will &quot;beat,&quot; and it&apos;ll<br/>&gt; still sound concordant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The whole reason I&apos;m going on and on about this is because 14-EDO&apos;s subminor triad sounds worse than 21-EDO&apos;s and even 23-EDO&apos;s, despite the fact that it is closer to 6:7:9 than the other two. I wanted to know if 3HE could explain why this is, and (in the state it currently exists), it can&apos;t. So far the only person who&apos;s given me any sort of an explanation is Lobawad, who has told me that looking at the coincidence of partials in a 6:7:9 triad explains why it should be more sensitive to a slight mistuning than to a gross mistuning.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Setharean dissonance is very important. Do you still feel that the<br/>&gt; chords rank the same way if you use sine waves?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That explanation actually makes sense to me, and maybe even also explains why I find 17-TET to be more concordant than 12-TET when it comes to playing major triads: harmonic identities associated with higher partials (like 7/6, 9/7, and even 5/4) could be more sensitive to a slight mistuning than a gross one because of critical band effects between the higher partials of a sound. If you actually listen to the sound example I posted, you can definitely hear beating between the higher partials. I may have done the math wrong, but assuming I haven&apos;t, the frequency difference between the higher partials of two tones is going to be larger than the frequency difference between the root tones.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then maybe I misunderstood you; I think this is definitely true, but I<br/>&gt; just think there are different things going on, all of which can cause<br/>&gt; unpleasant &quot;dissonance&quot;-like sensations to arise. There&apos;s no point<br/>&gt; comparing the two to see what makes better predictions, because there<br/>&gt; are multiple things that can cause dissonance and both are valid in<br/>&gt; different respects.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For example, according to my calculations based on a fundamental of 400 Hz, there will be critical band dissonance between the 5th partial of the fundamental and the 4th partial of a note a 12-TET major 3rd above it, but there will NOT be critical band dissonance between the 5th partial of the fundamental and the 4th partial of a note a 17-TET supermajor 3rd above it. So regardless of the fact that 12-TET&apos;s 3rd is closer to a 5/4, 17&apos;s actually sounds better because it creates less audible beating in some registers.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, but the further you get away from 5/4, the more it starts<br/>&gt; sounding dissonant for other reasons. 450 cents, for instance, doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; have any beating at all, but you&apos;ve said that you hate it. So both of<br/>&gt; them play a factor.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Perhaps what would satisfy you is to multiply the two curves together<br/>&gt; pointwise, such that you get a combined dissonance rating that factors<br/>&gt; both of them into account. That way there&apos;s still a &quot;bad spot&quot; around<br/>&gt; 5/4 where critical band dissonance reaches a peak, but then once you<br/>&gt; get out of that, although it may go back down for a little bit,<br/>&gt; dissonance will then go back up as the major third goes into 450 cent<br/>&gt; territory and beyond; and then back down once it gets into 4/3<br/>&gt; territory and so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To me, beating is the only factor of concordance that matters, because the only reason concordance is of interest to me in the first place is because it&apos;s supposed to tell me how high I can crank up the fuzz pedal on an interval and not have it go to s***.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That has far more to do with HE than it has to do with beating. I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; spare you the mathematics involved - just minor chords and just major<br/>&gt; chords both beat the same, but they end up sounding completely<br/>&gt; different if you put distortion on them, whether you do it with sine<br/>&gt; waves or not. The reason has to do with that distortion generates sum<br/>&gt; and difference tones as well as perfectly harmonic combination tones -<br/>&gt; so for a tempered interval these tones will end up falling very near<br/>&gt; to one another and you&apos;ll get a huge complex of tones so closely<br/>&gt; packed that the resulting beating clusterf*#@&amp; will make you want to<br/>&gt; die. This doesn&apos;t happen for JI intervals, where all of the resultant<br/>&gt; tones overlap.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And I have to say, recent events have made me entirely re-think my view of the importance of &quot;approximation&quot; in tempering. I used to think that just looking at absolute error from the nearest Just interval was enough, but now I see it&apos;s a lot more complicated than that. Absolute error is not a good indicator of critical band effects between (say) the first 16 partials. Neither, it seems, is harmonic entropy. In fact, it might be the case that looking at ETs in terms of JI approximation is ass-backwards, and I should just toss it out whole-hog, since it&apos;s (apparently) no predictor of how concordant that ET will sound?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that you can predict how concordant &quot;certain&quot; chords will<br/>&gt; sound in an ET. For otonal chords, I recommend using some combination<br/>&gt; of HE and Setharean dissonance, since that seems to be what you like<br/>&gt; best. For utonal chords, you should maybe just stick with Setharean<br/>&gt; dissonance for now, unless you want to join the crusade in hashing<br/>&gt; some of the math out in looking at all of the subsets of the chord.<br/>&gt; You can use HE for utonal chords as well, but as you can see you&apos;re<br/>&gt; only getting half of the picture.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Mike<br/>&gt;</p></div>
