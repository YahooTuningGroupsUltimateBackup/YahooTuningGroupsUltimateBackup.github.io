He<br/>graciously did so.  His hand written documents can be viewed on my website.<br/>Just scroll down the index page and click on the link, &quot;Mathematical Analysis<br/>of the EBVT by Professor Owen Jorgensen, RPT&quot;.</p><p>I have always tuned this idea aurally but often stored my results as a custom<br/>program in my Sanderson Accu-Tuner.  Many interested people, however wanted<br/>to know the so-called &quot;Correction Figures&quot; which are a set of deviations<br/>applied to an Electronic Tuning Program.  These proved very difficult to<br/>determine because there had never been a firm, theoretical model established.<br/> Professor Jorgensen helped me to find it.</p><p>Now, the Equal Beating Victorian Temperament can be accurately tuned by<br/>anyone with an Electronic Tuning Device (ETD) which provides a stretch<br/>program for Inharmonicity compensation.  The only difference remaining<br/>between that and the way I actually tune the piano will be in the way I<br/>manipulate the octaves but a study of my method called &quot;Tempered Octaves&quot;<br/>will show how to make this small adjustment if desired.</p><p>The official Correction Figures are transcribed here:</p><p>C    +3.8<br/>C#   -0.8<br/>D    +0.9<br/>D#   +3.1<br/>E     -2.0<br/>F     +1.8<br/>F#   -2.7<br/>G    +3.1<br/>G#   +1.2<br/>A       0.0<br/>A#    +2.4<br/>B       0.0</p><p>All comments are welcome.</p><p>Bill Bremmer RPT<br/>Madison, Wisconsin<br/><a href="http://www.Billbremmer.com">www.Billbremmer.com</a></p></div>
