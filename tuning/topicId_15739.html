But it sounds quite distinct to me,<br/>&gt;from either 16:19:24 or 1/(6:5:4) = 1/6 : 1/5 : 1/4 = 10:12:15. I don&apos;t<br/>&gt;think even barbershop ever uses 6:7:9 as a tuning of a minor triad.</p><p>Quite right.  At least, I can&apos;t say I&apos;ve ever heard it.  Problem is<br/>rootedness again, methinks.  I would say the 6: is even less the root of<br/>6:7:9 than 10: is of the 10:12:15.  This owing to the fact that 6:7:9 can<br/>sometimes evoke a 1: sensation.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Paul H.

At this point, a very prominent phantom subdominant bass became<br/>apparent, that would usually be wholly unacceptable in the context of any<br/>conventional music. Of course, the 4:6:7:9 can be a wonderful chord to base<br/>changes and melodies on, as I demonstrated in the bridge section of my third<br/>22-tET piece at the Microthon.</p></div>
