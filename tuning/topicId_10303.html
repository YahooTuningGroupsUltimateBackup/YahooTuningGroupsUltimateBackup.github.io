(The former,<br/>&gt; of course, happened to be 1/9:1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 --</p><p>Hi Paul...</p><p>This is what I&apos;m not getting.  Why is the Utonal chord sounding like<br/>4:5:6:7:9?? Is this what it&apos;s SUPPOSED to sound like??  And I take it<br/>the chords are NOT supposed to be identical, as I surmised -- you<br/>mention a 50 cents shift that I was not hearing...</p><p>And the &quot;high pitch&quot; that is the &quot;fundamental&quot; of the Utonal series, is<br/>that the very tiny, extremely high tone in the first example??  That<br/>reminds me of the John Cage tone &quot;our own nervous system in<br/>operation...&quot;</p><p>______________ _______ ____ __ _ _<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
