What exactly is a &quot;root mood&quot;?&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A &quot;root mood&quot; is a measure of tension and mood of the strongest part of a piece of music&apos;s theme that&apos;s a point of resolution.&nbsp; Of course, your music has a &quot;root mood&quot;...but often it&apos;s not so apparent where or what that mood is because you spend so much time forming tension in between &quot;root mood&quot; chords and in places where the &quot;root mood&quot; chords can&apos;t work with the other chords.&nbsp; This is part of what, I believe, makes microtonal music so hard to follow for some.</p><p>&nbsp; An example...many pop songs, even more complex ones, have only two real &quot;root mood&quot; chords.&nbsp; &quot;root mood&quot; meaning that at least one of the two can be played behind virtually any other chord in the song without clashing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Try <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MzG-gabPIE&feature=fvwrel">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MzG-gabPIE&feature=fvwrel</a> (even though you will almost certainly consider it very elementary) :-D</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first verse has a first chord at 10 seconds that you can keep playing EVEN when the song changes to its second main chord.&nbsp; Same goes for the much lower chord at 12-13 seconds.<br/>&nbsp; There are a TON of little chords in between (6 or more by my ears...certainly more than most Ibiza-dance music), but those two fit with just about everything and the mood sort of coasts between them.&nbsp; There is also a third &quot;root mood&quot; chord at 16 seconds that is really just a more dramatic, higher-pitched extension to the first chord.</p><p>&nbsp; It seems to be a definitely pattern to me...catchy songs seem to get a lot of tonal moods and dissonance/complexity in, but still have a few chords/moods/themes that can always be played under everything else as a background.&nbsp; So you get both a raw sense of simplicity/predictability in listening and at least some pleasure of complex/varied emotions at the same time.</p></div>
