Or you might want to use two wide-5th chains of 17 tones (making a single chain of hemi-fourths, 62deg301) to introduce primes 5, 17, and 29.</p><p>That is also desirable under different circumstances.</p><p>  Taking any of the above, allow pitch clusters of +-3 (or more)<br/>  heptamerides, as needed.  To cut the number of tones in half, you<br/>  could consider the pitch clusters to be increments of 8 cents, i.e., +- only even numbers of heptamerides (particularly if your pitch clusters are going to be on the order of +-20 or +-30 cents.</p><p>That is a pretty neat suggestion. With this configuration, we need not notate any more than 43 pitches per octave. Minor calibrations while preserving the chain might actually work. I wonder what my Turkish colleagues on this list will say about this?</p><p>  Best,</p><p>  --George</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p></div>
