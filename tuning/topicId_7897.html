Take several alternative performances of the same piece<br/>and analyze the tuning. You will then have an idea as to what kind of<br/>accuracy you can meaningfully ascribe to performer intent and what is due to<br/>random errors. I think you&apos;ll find that the level of accuracy you implicitly<br/>ascribe to Robert Johnson (as evidenced by the variety and complexity of the<br/>ratios you use) doesn&apos;t hold up under this analysis. Yes is a trickier case<br/>since their vocal harmonies came out far better in the controlled<br/>environment of the studio than with the then-primitive arena amplification<br/>rigs. Still, Jon Anderson&apos;s errors in repetitions of the same passage should<br/>give you some idea of what level of accuracy he was capable of (not too<br/>sharp, I think, but better than Steve Howe).</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;xouoxno@virtulink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>1/19/2000 1:02:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&quot;Paul H.

I still<br/>get ET, it&apos;s a good way to keep on top of new releases<br/>and concerts. After 25 years of Fripp, I know the history<br/>pretty well so I don&apos;t really contribute.</p><p>--<br/>* D a v i d         B e a r d s l e y<br/>*           <a href="mailto:xouoxno@virtulink.com">xouoxno@virtulink.com</a><br/>*<br/>* 49/32  R a d i o &quot;all microtonal, all the time&quot;<br/>* M E L A  v i r t u a l  d r e a m house monitor<br/>*<br/>* <a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/lookhere.htm</a></p></div>
