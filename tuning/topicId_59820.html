However, it is based on 53-tET, and thus does not represent Maqam Music pitches adequately in my opinion. Not only that, but his assumption that 4:3+4:3 chords are more harmonious in comparison to 4:5:6 produces weird results that I can hardly identify with authentic Turkish Music.</p><p>I have been practicing polyphony with the Maqamat for the past year using JI intervals and my MOS scales. The results are quite interesting to hear. A systematical theory, however, shall have to wait my post-doctorate studies.</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Ozan</p><p>  ----- Original Message -----<br/>  From: Kraig Grady<br/>  To: tuning list<br/>  Sent: 22 A&gbreve;ustos 2005 Pazartesi 23:35<br/>  Subject: [tuning] turkish theory of polphony</p><p>  Was curious from our turkish friends if such a theory or observed<br/>  practice exist as i have been asked and thought i would throw it out here.</p><p>  a reference was name to &quot;Alif&quot; by Omar Faruk Tekbilek has some &quot;Turkish polyphony&quot;</p><p>  --<br/>  Kraig Grady<br/>  North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>  The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>  KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
