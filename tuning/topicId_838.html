Consider the following:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&#x9;a. Although the roots assigned to certain chords can be substantiated<br/>&gt;&#x9;acoustically, the general population has difficulty hearing which of<br/>&gt;&#x9;the chord tones is, in fact, the root; even for some musically<br/>&gt;&#x9;sophisticated persons the task is not easy.</p><p>This is already a foot note, but it is here where I&apos;d like to see a note<br/>with a reference!  The statment seems to assume that all chords are rooted<br/>on one of their tones... a potentially fatal omission of the possibility<br/>of virtual fundamentals.</p><p>&gt;b. If tonality is not learned, but an acoustical property of a collection<br/>&gt;of tones, then a given set of tones should always have the same focus.<br/>&gt;This is not always the case, however. The formation F-A-C&shy;D has been<br/>&gt;regarded by some theorists as centering on F, while others have felt that<br/>&gt;it centers on D.</p><p>Bzzz.  Harmonic entropy (and maybe even Van Eck alone) suggests that a<br/>given &quot;formation&quot; may present several foci simultaneously, even just<br/>&quot;acoustically&quot;.</p><p>&gt;c. Certain collections of tones imply a tonic not contained in the<br/>&gt;collection. The formation G-B-D-F, even when isolated from any musical<br/>&gt;context, will set up a tonic of C in the minds of many listeners. The<br/>&gt;most reasonable explanation of this is that through the repeated<br/>&gt;association of G-B-D-F with C, the listener has been conditioned to<br/>&gt;expect the latter when he hears the former.</p><p>Can listeners be conitioned to expect certain things to happen in a<br/>sequence?  Perhaps, but this is proving something weaker than the<br/>author needs to prove (there&apos;s a name for that...).  The author implies<br/>he is trying to show that there _isn&apos;t_ any acoustical or cognitive<br/>(Rothenberg-like) justification for tonality.  He hasn&apos;t shown this.</p><p>&gt;Information. /.../ Let us approach its definition by way of a musical<br/>&gt;example that&apos;s pertinent to our discussion. Suppose that the harmonic<br/>&gt;vocabulary of a composer includes sonorities m and x.  When he uses<br/>&gt;sonority m he resolves it rather freely, sometimes going to n, sometimes<br/>&gt;to o, sometimes to p. sometimes to q, etc.  But when he uses sonority x,<br/>&gt;he treats it much more strictly: it only resolves to y or z.  Sonority<br/>&gt;m, offering a greater number of choices for continuation, is said to be<br/>&gt;higher in information than sonority x, whose consequents are very<br/>&gt;restricted.  Information is, then, a measure of the randomness with<br/>&gt;which one harmonic event is followed by another.</p><p>Let&apos;s hope this is just an example -- this is a very restricted<br/>application of information theory, compared to what Brian and I were<br/>discussing.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
