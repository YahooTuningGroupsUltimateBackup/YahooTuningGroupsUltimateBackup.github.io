Well, not literally. Traditional<br/>well-temperament, using 12 tones, must have an average fifth of 700<br/>cents. Smaller-than-average errors will yield meantone, where 5-limit<br/>harmonies are improved up to the point where the average size of the<br/>fifths constructing them is 697&quot; or 696&quot;. Larger-than-average errors<br/>will then virtually always make their fifths closer to just intonation,<br/>yielding harsh 5-limit harmonies but approximating the Pythagorean, or<br/>pure 3-limit, at 702&quot;. If six fifths, enough for one diatonic scale, are<br/>tuned to an average of 698&quot;, the other six must average 702&quot;, giving<br/>three major thirds ~22&quot; sharp and four minor thirds ~22&quot; flat -- harsh,<br/>but borderline acceptable -- and fifths at the Pythagorean/pure 3-limit<br/>ideal.</p><p>A 22-tone well-temperament would have an average fifth of 709.091 cents.<br/>This is 12&quot; away from 697&quot;, and on the other side of just intonation<br/>(thus harmonic waste is unavoidable). If only six fifths are only<br/>tempered to an average of 699&quot;, the other sixteen share a total of<br/>60.5454 cents of error, so each is 712.875&quot;. This is borderline<br/>acceptable, and trying to get more than one diatonic key into meantone<br/>(by tempering more fifths to 699&quot;) or trying to get a better meantone in<br/>the one diatonic key would make at least one of the other fifths totally<br/>unacceptable. The sixteen 712.875&quot; fifths yield thirteen major thirds<br/>~65.186 cents sharp and fourteen minor thirds ~54.266 cents flat --<br/>TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!</p><p>However, my paper (I&apos;m sure you know the one by now) describes a 22-tone<br/>temperament with two different sizes of fifth, where some (decatonic)<br/>key areas give acceptable 7-limit harmony while others give near-just<br/>5-limit harmony, with subsets conforming to the Hindu diatonic scales in<br/>both 22-degree/sruti numbering and (necessarily) consonance/dissonance<br/>differentiation.</p></div>
