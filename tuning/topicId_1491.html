Erlich&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com">PErlich@Acadian-Asset.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;Subject: Reply to Eduardo Sabat-Garibaldi</p><p>&gt;&gt;Some years ago I discovered that the product of the numerator and<br/>&gt;&gt;denominator of any ratio (in its Canonic form) is straight related<br/>with<br/>&gt;&gt;the Rameau Fundamental Bass concept I called this product Indice<br/>&gt;&gt;Armonico (I avoid the Spanish accents because the ASCII symbols<br/>&gt;&gt;not works well everywhere) and was systematized for my purposes.<br/>&gt;&gt;This figure is the number of the harmonic (related with the Rameau<br/>Bass)<br/>&gt;&gt;that is in common with some specific harmonic of the notes.<br/>------------------------------<br/>&gt;Yes, Euler proposed this same harmonic index several centuries ago, and</p><p>&gt;Fokker calls the common harmonic the &quot;guide tone&quot;. I think Vogel calls<br/>&gt;it something similar.<br/>------------------------------</p><p>The reference I have and had about Euler is described in the Helmholtz<br/>book &quot;On the Sens...&quot;., and there the math is much more complex than the<br/>simple product that I propose.<br/>He adds &quot;degrees&quot; and substracts &quot;one&quot;. Really I don&apos;t understand the<br/>meaning.<br/>I tried to imagine some sort of Logs. (??)<br/>I suspect that this would be the moment to write a book on that matter<br/>but Im not in the better position to compile all the proposals and to<br/>handle properly the mathematic. Who of you ?<br/>BTW, I have the Spanixh version (1961) of the John Redfield book &quot;Music:<br/>a science and an art&quot; (1926), where he propose his own method to<br/>evaluate the musical harmony.</p><p>Eduardo</p></div>
