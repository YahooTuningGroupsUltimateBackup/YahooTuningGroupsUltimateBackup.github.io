background-color: #eee'><p>hello Walter,</p><p>i&apos;m not sure if you have cleared up your confusion<br/>about this question yet, because i myself became<br/>very confused trying to follow the discussion.</p><p>(it didn&apos;t help that the order in which i received<br/>the messages in my mailbox, and the time stamped<br/>on them, isn&apos;t the same as the order in which they<br/>were posted!)</p><p>anyway, i&apos;m just posting a little something here to<br/>try and help.</p><p>it&apos;s not clear to me that you understand what we<br/>mean by the word &quot;octave&quot;.  it comes from the Latin<br/>word for &quot;8th&quot;, since in the ordinary diatonic scale<br/>(do re mi fa so la ti do) notes which are 8 steps<br/>apart sound mysteriously &quot;the same&quot;.</p><p>i say &quot;mysteriously&quot; because it&apos;s obvious that these<br/>are two different notes, but there&apos;s something about<br/>their sound that causes us generally to identify them<br/>as being &quot;the same&quot;.  thus, they end up getting the<br/>same letter-name, since the letters were associated<br/>with pitches with reference to the above-mentioned<br/>diatonic scale.  thus, we have A B C D E F G for the<br/>7 different notes of the scales, then the 8th note,<br/>an &quot;octave&quot; above the first, gets the same letter, A.</p><p>well, there&apos;s a mathematical reason why that note sounds<br/>&quot;the same&quot; as the starting note.  it&apos;s because the<br/>frequency ratio of those two notes is or approximates 2:1.</p><p>as has been pointed out in this thread, all even-numbered<br/>harmonics are multiples of lower odd-numbered harmonics,<br/>one or more octaves higher.  thus, 6 is an octave above 3,<br/>10 is an octave above 5, etc.</p><p>so the business about &quot;powers of 2&quot; simply concerns &quot;octaves&quot;.</p><p>thus:</p><p>1 is the fundamental, 2 is an octave above it, 4 is<br/>2 octaves above it, 8 is 3 octaves above it, and 16 is<br/>4 octaves above it:</p><p>2^0 = 1<br/>2^1 = 2<br/>2^2 = 4<br/>2^3 = 8<br/>2^4 = 16</p><p>3 is the first harmonic which produces a note having a<br/>different letter-name, 6 is the octave above that,<br/>12 is 2 octaves above it, and 24 is 3 octaves above it:</p><p>3 * 2^0 = 3<br/>3 * 2^1 = 6<br/>3 * 2^2 = 12<br/>3 * 2^3 = 24</p><p>the next &quot;new note&quot; comes from the 5th harmonic, and<br/>10 is an octave above it, and 20 is 2 octaves above it:</p><p>5 * 2^0 = 5<br/>5 * 2^1 = 10<br/>5 * 2^2 = 20</p><p>the next &quot;new note&quot; comes from the 7th harmonic,<br/>and 14 is an octave above it, and 28 is 2 octaves<br/>above it:</p><p>7 * 2^0 = 7<br/>7 * 2^1 = 14<br/>7 * 2^2 = 28</p><p>the next &quot;new note&quot; comes from the 9th harmonic,<br/>and 18 is the octave above it.</p><p>9 * 2^0 = 9<br/>9 * 2^1 = 18</p><p>... and so on.</p><p>you will see from this that because 2 is by definition<br/>the ratio of the octave, and 2 is also by definition<br/>the factor which causes numbers to be classified as<br/>&quot;even&quot; rather than as &quot;odd&quot;, then ignoring octaves<br/>means that you&apos;re concentrating only on odd-numbered<br/>harmonics.  tuning theorists refer to this as &quot;odd-limit&quot;.</p><p>i deliberately included the trivial cases in the<br/>calculations above, to show how all the harmonic numbers<br/>could be notated as x * 2^y, where x is some odd-number<br/>and y is a power of 2.  if you&apos;re ignoring powers of 2,<br/>the odd-number component is all that matters.</p><p>in fact, it&apos;s a generally-held tenet among tuning<br/>theorists that odd-limit is important because each<br/>odd-number ratio (or an approximation of it) is a<br/>separate &quot;identity&quot; in a chord or other harmonic structure.</p><p>thus (assuming &quot;octave equivalence&quot;) :</p><p>1 = &quot;root&quot;<br/>3 = &quot;perfect 5th&quot;<br/>5 = &quot;major 3rd&quot;<br/>7 = &quot;minor 7th&quot;<br/>9 = &quot;major 9th&quot;<br/>11 = &quot;(harmonic) 11th&quot;<br/>13 = &quot;(harmonic) 13th&quot;<br/>15 = &quot;major 7th&quot;<br/>17 = &quot;minor 9th&quot;<br/>19 = &quot;augmented 9th&quot; or &quot;flat 10th&quot;</p><p>etc.</p><p>i included the &quot;(harmonic)&quot; for the &quot;11th&quot; and &quot;13th&quot;<br/>because they are so far off from the &quot;11th&quot; and &quot;13th&quot;<br/>that we get in the regular 12-tone equal-tempered scale<br/>(nearly midway between two 12edo notes) that they really<br/>don&apos;t resemble either of the two 12edo approximations,<br/>but rather have a very unique sound all their own.  the<br/>same is somewhat true of 7 representing the &quot;minor 7th&quot;.</p><p>i can&apos;t speak on the mechanics of guitar amplifiers,<br/>but i hope this helps you understand a little better.</p><p>i personally place more stock on the concept of<br/>&quot;prime-limit&quot;, with the idea that the lowest prime-numbers<br/>each have some type of &quot;affect&quot; associated with them,<br/>but i don&apos;t know how much this concerns your particular<br/>question.  i only say something about it because it<br/>*might* be useful to your research.</p><p>-monz</p><p>&gt;

I built my own distortion patch in Kyma, so I can share my experience here.</p><p>The even-order harmonics are favored because when a tube amplifier gets into the nonlinear region it treats the positive and negative parts of the signal differently.  If you start with a sine wave, symmetric clipping will give you only odd harmonics.  That doesn&apos;t sound so bad, but it&apos;s only one sound and probably not the one you want.  Any kind of asymmetry will add even harmonics, which leads to a warmer sound.  One explanation for this is that the octave above the fundamental is stronger.</p><p>With real signals, they won&apos;t look much like a sine wave, so the above explanation doesn&apos;t really hold.  But it&apos;s still a good rule of thumb. Most guitar notes will end up like square waves if you clip them enough.   And apparently this is still true with a tube amplifier -- the differences are only for moderate distortion.  Transistors are different, see below.</p><p>The way I emulated this is:</p><p>1) split the signal into positive and negative components</p><p>2) apply different gains using an ideal clipping amplifier</p><p>3) put them back together again</p><p>4) somwhere in the mix you could apply a high pass filter to remove the asymmetry of the signal.  I don&apos;t always do this.</p><p>You can build electronics to do the same kind of thing.  There are circuit diagrams on the web, I don&apos;t have URLs to hand.  You need diodes to separate out the positive and negative parts.  This is where you have to think about transistors -- they introduce their own artefacts which are harsher than those of either tubes or ideal operational amplifiers.   Apparently these involve inharmonic tones, which would be a particular problem with just intonation.  So for best results use op-amps rather than straight transistors.</p><p>While I&apos;m at it, tube amplifiers also give smoother clipping than op-amps.  That is, the corner of the signal is curved rather than sharp.   To emulate this, apply an arctan waveshaper (which will also amplify the signal a bit) before the gain, if that&apos;s relevant to whatever system you&apos;re using.  These days, I plot my waveshaper curve algorithmically so that I can take into account both the smoothing and the asymmetry.</p><p>I don&apos;t have any tube amplifiers to compare to, so I don&apos;t know how close I&apos;m getting.  But it does sound good.  One advantage is that all parameters are controllable.  So you can have the asymmetric gain without any clipping, which is interesting.</p><p>                          Graham</p></div><h3><a id=43048 href="#43048">ðŸ”—</a>David Beardsley &#x3C;davidbeardsley@biink.com&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2003 4:48:47 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &quot;electricwally77&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:earth7@optonline.net">earth7@optonline.net</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Wednesday, March 26, 2003 10:06 PM<br/>Subject: [tuning] Re: Help with even-order harmonics please-amended-</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; If 5 was your fundamental, it wouldn&apos;t be 5/4, it would be 1/1.<br/>&gt; &gt; * David Beardsley<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; David, where did you get 5/4 ?

You are right. 10 is a double of 5 thus 10<br/>is an<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; octave above 5. However when using 1 (the fundamental)<br/>as the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;reference point, 5 and 10 are not octaves of 1. Correct(I<br/>hope)?<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Walter<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;correct! they are octaves of a note a major third above the 1.<br/>386<br/>&gt; &gt;cents, to be exact.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fellow Tuning Members,<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not understanding &quot;a major third above 1&quot;.

Please explain<br/>as basic<br/>&gt; as possible. Thanks all.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Walter</p><p>an octave is 1200 cents. so if the fundamental is 0 cents, the 4th<br/>harmonic is 2400 cents, and the fifth harmonic is 2786 cents. the<br/>tenth harmonic is 1200 cents higher, at 3986 cents above the<br/>fundamental.</p><p>let me know if i can help clarify anything else.</p></div>
